      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. Early Poems. PASTORAL PICTURES. I. Down the River. How merry a life the little River leads, Piping a vagrant ditty free from care; Now rippling as it rustles through the reeds And broad-leaved lilies sailing here and there, Now lying level with the clover meads And musing in a mist of golden air! Bearing a pastoral peace where'er it goes, Narrow'd to mirth or broaden'd to repose: Through copsy villages and tiny towns, By belts of woodland singing sweet, Pausing where sun and shadow meet Without the darkness of the breezy downs, Bickering o'er the keystone as it flows 'Neath mossy bridges arch'd like maiden feet; And slowly widening as it seaward grows, Because its summer mission grows complete. Run seaward, for I follow! Let me cross My garden-threshold ankle-deep in moss. Sweet Stream, your heart is beating and I hear it, As conscious of its pleasure as a girl's: O little River, whom I love so well, Is it with something of a human spirit You twine those lilies in your sedgy curls? Take up the inner voice we both inherit, O little River of my love, and tell! The rain has crawled from yonder mountain-side, And passing, left its footprints far and wide. The path I follow winds by cliff and scar, Purple and dark and trodden as I pass, The foxglove droops, the crocus lifts its star, And bluebells brighten in the dewy grass. Over deep pools the willow hangs its hair, Dwarf birches show their sodden roots and shake Their melting jewels on my bending brows, The mottled mavis pipes among their boughs For joy of five unborn in yonder brake. The River, narrow'd to a woody glen, Leaps trembling o'er a little rocky ledge, Then broadens forward into calm again Where the gray moor-hen builds her nest of sedge; Caught in the dark those willow-trees have made, Lipping the yellow lilies o'er and o'er, It flutters twenty feet along the shade, Halts at the sunshine like a thing afraid, And turns to kiss the lilies yet once more. Those little falls are lurid with the rain That ere the day is done will come again. The River falters swoll'n and brown, Falters, falters, as it nears them, Shuddering back as if it fears them, Falters, falters, falters, falters, Then dizzily rushes down. But all is calm again, the little River Smiles on and sings the song it sings for ever. Here at the curve it passes tilth and farm, And faintly flowing onward to the mill It stretches out a little azure arm To aid the miller, aiding with a will, And singing, singing still. Sweet household sounds come sudden on mine ear: The waggons rumbling in the rutted lanes, The village clock and trumpet Chanticleer, The flocks and cattle on the marish-plains, With shouts of urchins ringing loud and clear; And lo! a Village, breathing breath that curls In foam-white wreaths through ancient sycamores! A hum of looms comes through the cottage doors. I stumble on a group of country girls Faring afield thro' deep and dewy grass; Small urchins rush from sanded kitchen-floors To stare with mouths wide open as I pass. But yonder cottage where the woodbine grows, Half cottage and half inn, a pretty place, Tempts ramblers with the country cheer it shows; Entering, I rob the threshold of a rose, And meet the welcome on a mother's face. Come, let me sit. The scent of garden flowers Flits through the casement of the sanded room, Hitting the sense with thoughts of summer hours When half the world has budded into bloom. Is that the faded picture of our host Shading the plate of pansies where I sit— That lean-limb'd stripling straighter than a post, Clad in a coat that seems a sorry fit? I drink his health in this his own October, That bites so sharply on the thirsty tongue; And here he comes, but not so slim and sober As in the days when Love and he were young. ‘Hostess!’ I fill again and pledge the glory Of that stout angel answering to my call, Who changed him from the shadow on the wall Into the rosy tun of sack before me! Again I follow where the river wanders. The landscape billows into hills of thyme; Over the purple heights I slowly climb; Till in a glen of birchen-trees and boulders I halt, beneath a heathery mountain ridge Clothed on with amber cloud from head to shoulders. I wander on and gain a mossy bridge, And watch the angling of a shepherd boy; Below the little river glimmers by, Touched with a troubled sense of pain or joy By some new life at work in earth and sky. The marshes there steam mist from hidden springs, Deep-hidden in the marsh the bittern calls, And yonder swallow oils its ebon wings While fluttering o'er the falls. Below my feet the little budding flower Thrusts up dark leaves to feel the coming shower: I'll trust these weather-signs and creep apart Beneath this crag until the rain depart,— 'Twill come again and go within an hour. The moist soft wind has died and fallen now, The air is hot and hush'd on flower and tree, The leaves are troubled into sighs, and see! There falls a heavy drop upon my brow. The cloudy standard is above unfurl'd; The aspen fingers of the blinded Rain Feel for the summer eyelids of the world That she may kiss them open once again. Darker and darker, till with one accord The clouds pour forth their hoard in gusts of power, A sunbeam rends their bowels like a sword And frees the costly shower! Fluttering around me and before me, Stretched like a mantle o'er me, The rushing shadows blind the earth and skies, Dazzling a darkness on my gazing eyes With troublous gleams of radiance, like the bright Pigments of gold that flutter in our sight, When with shut eyes we strain Our aching vision back upon the brain. Across the skies and o'er the plain Fast fly the swollen shadows of the Rain; Blown duskly by, From hill to hill they fly, O'er solitary streams and windy downs, O'er trembling villages and darkened towns! I crouch beneath the crag and watch the mist Move on the skirts of yonder mountains gray Until it bubbles into amethyst And softly melts away. The thyme-bells catch their drops of silver dew, And quake beneath the load; The squadron'd pines that shade the splashing road Are glimmering with a million jewels too. And hark! the Spirit of the Rain Sings to the Summer sleeping, Pressing a dark damp face against the plain, And pausing, pausing, not for pain, Pausing, pausing, ere the low refrain, Because she cannot sing for weeping. She flings her cold dim arms about the Earth, That soon shall wear the blessing she has given, Then brightens thro' her tears in sunny mirth And flutters back to heaven. A fallen sunbeam trembles at my feet, And as I sally forth the linnets frame Their throats to answer yonder laverock sweet. The jewell'd trees flash out in emerald flame. The bright drops fall with throbs of peaceful sound, And melt in circles on the shallow pools That glisten on the ground. Last, Iris issues from her cloudy shrine, Trembling alone in heaven where she rules, And arching down to kiss with kisses sweet The bright green world that flashes at her feet, Runs liquid through her many hues divine. II. The Summer Pool. There is a singing in the summer air, The blue and brown moths flutter o'er the grass, The stubble bird is creaking in the wheat, And perch'd upon the honeysuckle hedge Pipes the green linnet. Oh, the golden world! The stir of life on every blade of grass, The motion and the joy on every bough, The glad feast everywhere, for things that love The sunshine, and for things that love the shade! Aimlessly wandering with weary feet, Watching the wool white clouds that wander by, I come upon a lonely place of shade,— A still green Pool, where with soft sound and stir The shadows of o'erhanging branches sleep, Save where they leave one dreamy space of blue, O'er whose soft stillness ever and anon The feathery cirrhus blows. Here unaware I pause, and leaning on my staff I add A shadow to the shadows; and behold! Dim dreams steal down upon me, with a hum Of little wings, a murmuring of boughs,— The dusky stir and motion dwelling here, Within this small green world. O'ershadowëd By dusky greenery, tho' all around The sunshine throbs on fields of wheat and bean, Downward I gaze into the dreamy blue, And pass into a waking sleep, wherein The green boughs rustle, feathery wreaths of cloud Pass softly, piloted by golden airs: The air is still,—no birds sing any more,— And, helpless as a tiny flying thing, I am alone in all the world with God. The wind dies—not a leaf stirs—on the Pool The fly scarce moves; Earth seems to hold her breath Until her heart stops, listening silently For the far footsteps of the coming Rain! While thus I pause, it seems that I have gained New eyes to see; my brain grows sensitive To trivial things that, at another hour, Had passed unheeded. Suddenly the air Shivers, the shadows in whose midst I stand Tremble and blacken—the blue eye o' the Pool Is closed and clouded; with a sudden gleam, Oiling its wings, a swallow darteth past, And weedling flowers beneath my feet thrust up Their leaves to feel the fragrant shower. Oh hark! The thirsty leaves are troubled into sighs, And up above me, on the glistening boughs, Patters the summer Rain! Into a nook, Screen'd by thick foliage of oak and beech, I creep for shelter; and the summer shower Murmurs around me. Oh, the drowsy sounds! The pattering rain, the numerous sigh of leaves, The deep, warm breathing of the scented air, Sink sweet into my soul—until at last Comes the soft ceasing of the gentle fall, And lo! the eye of blue within the Pool Opens again, while with a silvern gleam Dew-diamonds twinkle moistly on the leaves, Or, shaken downward by the summer wind, Fall melting on the Pool in rings of light! III. Up the River. Behind the purple mountains lies a lake, Steadfast thro' storm and sunshine in its place; Asleep 'neath changing skies, its waters make A mirror for the tempest's thunder-face; Thence—singing songs of glee, Fluttering to my cottage by the sea, By bosky glen and grove, Past the lone shepherd, moveless as the rock Whence stretch'd at length he views his scatter'd flock,— Cometh the little River that I love. To-day I'll bid farewell to books, And by the River loved so well, Thro' ferny haunts and flowery nooks, Thro' stony glen and woody dell, The rainy river-path I'll take, Till by the silent-sleeping lake I hear the shepherd's bell. The summer bleats from every rocky height, The bluebell banks are dim with dewy light, The heavens are clear as infants' eyes above; This is no day—you, little River, know it!— For sage or poet To localise his love. In rippling cadence, calm and slow, Sing, little River, as I go, Songs of the mountains whence you flow! The grassy banks are wet with dew that flashes Silverly on the Naiad-river's lashes— The Naiad-river, bright with sunken suns, Who murmureth as she runs. Yonder the silver-bellied salmon splashes Within the spreading circle of blue shade That his own leaps have made: And here I stoop, and pluck with tender care A lily from the Naiad's sedgy hair. And curling softly over pebble, Weaving soft waves o'er yellow sands, Singing her song in tinkling treble, The mountain Lady thro' the farmer's lands Slides to the sea, with harvest-giving hands. Here freckled cowslips bloom unsought, Like yellow jewels on her light green train; And yonder, dark with dreaming of the rain, Grows the wood-violet like a lowly thought. Lightly the mountain Lady dances down, Dressed maidenly in many a woodland gem;— Lo, even where the footprint of the clown Has bruised her raiment-hem, Crimson-tipp'd daisies make a diadem. The little River is the fittest singer To sound the praises of a day so fair. The dews, suck'd up thro' pores of sunshine, linger As silver cloudlets in mid-air; And over all the sunshine throws Its golden glamour of repose. The Silence listens, in a dream, To hear the ploughman urge his reeling team, The trout, that flashes with a sudden gleam, And musical motions heaved by hills that bound The slumberous vales around. I loiter onward slowly, and the whole Sweet joy is in my happy fancies drowned. The sunshine meets the music. Sight and sound Are wedded by the Soul. —Sing, little River, this sweet morn, Songs of the hills where thou wert born! For, suddenly, mine eyes perceive The purple hills that touch the sky: Familiar with the stars of eve, Against the pale blue West they lie, Netted in mists of azure air, With thread-like cataracts here and there. Oh hark! Oh hark! The shepherd shouts, and answering sheepdogs bark; And voices, startling Echo from her sleep, Are blown from steep to steep. At yonder falls, the trembling mountain Lady Clings to the bramble high above me lying, With veil of foam behind her swift feet flying, And a lorn terror in her lifted voice, Ere springing to the rush-friezed basin shady, That boils below with noise. Then, whirling dizzily for a moment's space, She lets the sun flash brightly on her face, And lightly laughs at her own terror past, And floateth onward fast! Thus wandering onward, ankle deep in grass, Scaring the cumbrous black cock as I pass, I came upon two shepherd boys, who wade For coolness in the limpid waves, And with their shade Startle the troutling from its shallow caves. Let me lie down upon the bank, and drink! The minnows at the brim, with bellies white Upturned in specks of silvery light, Flash from me in a shower, and sink. Below, the blue skies wink Thro' heated golden air—a clear abyss Of azure, with a solitary bird Steadfastly winging thro' the depths unstirred. The brain turns dizzy with its bliss; And I would plunge into the chasms cool, And float to yonder cloud of fleecy wool, That floats below me, as I kiss The mountain Lady's lips with thirsty mouth. What would parch'd Dives give amid his drouth For kisses such as this? Sing, little River, while I rest, Songs of your hidden mountain nest, And of the blue sky in your breast! The landscape darkens slowly With mountain shadows; when I wander on, The tremulous gladness of the heat seems gone, And a cool awe spreads round me, sweet and holy,— A tender, sober-suited melancholy. The path rough feet have made me winds away O'er fenny meadows to the white highway, Where the big waggon clatters with its load, And pushing onward, to the ankles wet In swards as soft as silken sarcenet, I gain the dusty road. The air is hotter here. The bee booms by With honey-laden thigh, Doubling the heat with sounds akin to heat; And like a floating flower the butterfly Swims upward, downward, till its feet Clin to the hedgerows white and sweet. A black duck rises clumsily with a cry, And the dim lake is nigh. The road curves upward to a dusty rise, Where fall the sunbeams flake on flake; And turning at the curve, mine eyes Fall sudden on the silent lake, Asleep 'neath hyacinthine skies. Sing, little River, in your mirth, Sing to thyself for joy the earth Is smiling on your humble worth; And sing for joy that earth has given A place of birth so near to heaven! Sing, little River, while I climb These little hills of rock and thyme; And hear far-off your tinkling chime! The cataracts burst in foamy sheen; The hills slope blackly to the water's brim, And far below I see their shadows dim; The lake, so closely hemmed between Their skirts of heather and of grass, Grows black and cold beneath me as I pass. The sunlight fades on mossy rocks, And on the mountain sides the flocks Are split like streams;—the highway dips Down, narrowing to the path where lambs Lay to the udders of their dams Their soft and pulpy lips. The hills grow closer; to the right The path sweeps round a shadowy bay, Upon whose slated fringes, white And crested wavelets play. All else is still. But list, oh list! Hidden by boulders and by mist, A shepherd whistles in his fist; From height to height the far sheep bleat In answering iteration sweet. Sound, seeking Silence, bends above her, Within some haunted mountain grot; Kisses her, like a trembling lover— So that she stirs in sleep, but wakens not! Along this rock I'll lie, With face turn d upward to the sky. A dreamy numbness glows within my brain— It is not joy and is not pain— 'Tis like the solemn, sweet imaginings That cast a shade on Music's golden wings. With face turned upward to the sun, I lie as indolent as one Who, in a vision sweet, perceives Spirits thro' mists of lotus leaves; And now and then small shadows move Across me, cast by clouds so small Mine eyes perceive them scarce at all In the unsullied blue above. I hear the streams that burst and fall, The straggling shepherd's frequent call, The kine low bleating as they pass, The dark lake stirring with the breeze, The melancholy hum of bees, The very murmur of the grass. IV. Snow. I wander forth this chill December dawn: John Frost and all his elves are out, I see, As busy as the elfin world can be, Clothing a world asleep with fleecy lawn. 'Mid the deep silence of the evening hours They glimmered duskly down in silent showers, And featly have they laboured all night long, Cheering their labour with a half-heard rhyme— Low as the burthen of a milkmaid's song When Echo moans it over hills of thyme. There is a hush of music on the air— The white-wing'd fays are faltering everywhere; And here and there, Made by a sudden mingling as they fall, There comes a softer lullaby than all, Swept in upon the universal prayer. Mine eyes and heart are troubled with a motion Of music like the moving waves of ocean, When, out of hearing, o'er the harbour bars They sigh toward the moon and jasper stars. The tiny squadrons waver down and thicken, Gathering numbers as they fly, And nearing earth their thick-set ranks they quicken, And swim in swarms to die! But now the clouds are winnowëd away: The sky above is gray as glass; below The feeble twilight of the dreamy day Nets the long landskip hush'd beneath the snow. The arrowy frosts sting keenly as I stray Along the rutted lane or broad highway, Past wind-swept hedges sighing sharp and clear, Where half the sweetly changeful year The scented summer loves to gleam and glow. The new-lain snowy carpet, ankle-deep, Crumbles beneath my footsteps as I pass, Revealing scanty blades of frozen grass; On either side the chirping sparrows leap, And here and there a robin, friendly now, From naked bough to bough. That snow-clad homestead in the river's arm Is haunted with the noisy rooks that fly Between its leafless beeches and the sky, And hailing fast for yonder fallow farm, A solitary crow is plunging by. Light muffled winds arising high among White mountains brooding in their winter rest, Bear from the eastern winter to the West The muttered diapason of a song Made by the thunder on a mountain's breast. The sun is hanging in a purple globe, 'Mid yellow mists that stir with silver breath; The quiet landskip slumbers, white as death, Amid its naked fields and woody wolds, Wearing the winter as a stainless robe Low-trailing in a fall of fleecy folds. By pasture-gates the mottled cattle swarm, Thick'ning the misty air, with piteous eyes Fixed ever on the tempest-breeding skies, And watch the lingering traces of the storm. A feeble sunbeam kisses and illumes Yon whitened spire that hints a hidden town, And flickering for a space it darkens down Above the silence of forgotten tombs. I gain the shoulder of the woodland now, A fledgling's flutter from a small hill's brow. I see the hamlet, half a mile below, With dripping gables and with crimson panes, And watch the urchins in the narrow lanes Below the school-house, shouting in the snow. The whitened coach comes swiftly round the road With horns to which a dozen hills reply, And rattling onward with its laughing load, Halts steaming at the little hostelry. Hard by the lonely woodman pants and glows, And, wrapt in leather stockings to the thigh, Toils with an icicle beneath his nose. In yonder field an idle farm-boy blows His frozen fingers into tingling flame; The gaunt old farmer, as he canters by, Reins in to greet the country clowns by name; That chestnut pony in the yellow fly Draws the plump parson and his leaner dame. I loiter down the road, and feel the ground Like iron 'neath my heel; the windless air Seems lying in a swound. Frost follows in its path without a sound, And plies his nimble fingers everywhere, Under my eyelids and beneath my hair. Yon mountain dons once more its helm of cloud, The air grows dark and dim as if in wonder; Once more the heaven is winnow'd, and the crowd Of silken fays flock murmurously under A sky that flutters like a wind-swept shroud. Through gloomy dimbles, clad with new-fall'n snow, Back to my little cottage home I go. But once again I roam by field and flood, Stung into heat where hoar-frosts melt and bite, What time the fog-wrapt sun drops red as blood, And Eve's white star is tingling into sight. TO THE LUGGIE. See ‘The Luggie and other Poems,’ by the late David Gray. Oh, sweet and still around the hill Thy silver waters, Brook, are creeping; Beneath the hill, as sweet and still, Thy weary Friend lies sleeping: A laurel leaf is in his hair, His eyes are closed to human seeming, And surely he hath dreams most fair, If he, indeed, be dreaming. O Brook! he smiled, a happy child, Upon thy banks, and loved thy crying, And, as time flew, thy murmur grew A trouble purifying; Till, last, thy laurel leaf he took, Dream-eyed and tearful, like a woman, And turned thy haunting cry, O Brook! To speech divine and human. O Brook! in song full sweet and strong, He sang of thee he loved so dearly; Then softly creep around his sleep, And murmur to him cheerly; For though he knows no fret or fear, Though life no more slips strangely through him, Yet he may rest more sound to hear His friend so close unto him. And when at last the sleepers cast Their swathes aside, and, wondering, waken, Let thy Friend be full tenderly In silvern arms uptaken. Him be it then thy task to bear Up to the Footstool, softly flowing,— Smiles on his eyes, and in his hair Thy leaf of laurel blowing! FRA GIACOMO. I. Alas, Fra Giacomo, Too late! but follow me . . . Hush! draw the curtain—so! She is dead, quite dead, you see. Poor little lady! she lies, All the light gone out of her eyes! But her features still wear that soft, Gray, meditative expression, Which you must have noticed oft, Thro' the peephole, at confession. How saintly she looks, how meek! Though this be the chamber of death, I fancy I feel her breath, As I kiss her on the cheek. Too holy for me, by far!— As cold and as pure as a star, Not fashioned for kissing and pressing, But made for a heavenly crown! . . . Ay, Father, let us go down,— But first, if you please, your blessing. II. . . . Wine? No! Come, come, you must! Blessing it with your prayers, You'll quaff a cup, I trust, To the health of the Saint upstairs. My heart is aching so! And I feel so weary and sad, Through the blow that I have had! You'll sit, Fra Giacomo? . . . III. Heigho! 'tis now six summers Since I saw that angel and married her— I was passing rich, and I carried her Off in the face of all comers . . . So fresh, yet so brimming with Soul! A sweeter morsel, I swear, Never made the dull black coal Of a monk's eye glitter and glare . . . Your pardon—nay, keep your chair!— A jest! but a jest! . . . Very true, It is hardly becoming to jest, And that Saint upstairs at rest— Her Soul may be listening, too! To think how I doubted and doubted, Suspected, grumbled at, flouted That golden-hair'd Angel, and solely Because she was zealous and holy!— Night and noon and morn She devoted herself to piety— Not that she seemed to scorn, Or shun, her husband's society; But the claims of her Soul superseded All that I asked for or needed, And her thoughts were far away From the level of lustful clay, And she trembled lest earthly matters Interfered with her aves and paters! Sweet dove! she so fluttered, in flying To avoid the black vapours of Hell, So bent on self-sanctifying,— That she never thought of trying To save her poor husband as well! And while she was named and elected For place on the heavenly roll, I (beast that I was) suspected Her manner of saving her Soul— So half for the fun of the thing, What did I (blasphemer!) but fling On my shoulders the gown of a monk, (Whom I managed for that very day To get safely out of the way), And seat me, half-sober, half-drunk, With the cowl drawn over my face, In the Father Confessor's place . . . Eheu! benedicite! In her beautiful sweet simplicity, With that pensive gray expression, She sighfully knelt at confession,— While I bit my lips till they bled, And dug my nails in my palm, And heard, with averted head, The horrible words come calm— Each word was a serpent's sting; But, wrapt in my gloomy gown, I sat like a marble thing As she uttered your name. Sit down! IV. More wine, Fra Giacomo? One cup—as you love me! No? Come, drink! 'twill bring the streaks Of crimson back to your cheeks. Come! drink again to the Saint, Whose virtues you loved to paint, Who, stretched on her wifely bed, With the soft, sweet, gray expression You saw and admired at confession— Lies poisoned, overhead! V. Sit still—or, by God, you die! Face to face, soul to soul, you and I Have settled accounts, in a fine Pleasant fashion, over our wine— Stir not, and seek not to fly— Nay, whether or not, you are mine! Thank Montepulciano for giving Your death in such delicate sips— 'Tis not every monk ceases living With so pleasant a taste on his lips— But lest Montepulciano unsurely should kiss, Take this!—and this!—and this! VI. . . . Raise him; and cast him, Pietro, Into the deep canal below: You can be secret, lad, I know . . . And hark you, then to the convent go— Bid every bell of the convent toll, And the monks say mass, for your mistress's soul. CHARMIAN. Cleo. Charmian!Char. Madam?Cleo. Give me to drink mandragora! Antony and Cleopatra. In the time when water-lilies shake Their green and gold on river and lake, When the cuckoo calls in the heart o' the heat, When the Dog-star foams and the shade is sweet; Where cool and fresh the River ran, I sat by the side of Charmian, And heard no sound from the world of man. All was so sweet and still that day! The rustling shade, the rippling stream, All life, all breath, dissolved away Into a golden dream; Warm and sweet the scented shade Drowsily caught the breeze and stirred, Faint and low through the green glade Came hum of bee and song of bird. Our hearts were full of drowsy bliss, And yet we did not clasp nor kiss, Nor did we break the happy spell With tender tone or syllable. But to ease our hearts and set thought free, We pluckt the flowers of a red rose-tree, And leaf by leaf, we threw them, Sweet, Into the River at our feet, And in an indolent delight Watch'd them glide onward, out of sight. Sweet, had I spoken boldly then, How might my love have garner'd thee! But I had left the paths of men, And sitting yonder, dreamily, Was happiness enough for me! Seeking no gift of word or kiss, But looking in thy face, was bliss! Plucking the rose-leaves in a dream, Watching them glimmer down the stream, Knowing that eastern heart of thine Shared the dim ecstasy of mine! Then, while we linger'd, cold and gray Came Twilight, chilling soul and sense; And you arose to go away, Full of a sweet indifference! I missed the spell—I watch'd it break,— And such come never twice to man: In a less golden hour I spake, And did not win thee, Charmian! For wearily we truned away Into the world of everyday, And from thy heart the fancy fled Like the rose-leaves on the River shed; But to me that hour is sweeter far Than the world and all its treasures are: Still to sit on so close to thee, Were happiness enough for me! Still to sit on in a green nook, Nor break the spell by word or look! To reach out happy hands for ever, To pluck the rose-leaves, Charmian! To watch them fade on the gleaming River, And hear no sound from the world of man! CLOUDLAND. Under green branches I lie, Pensive, I know not why; All is dead calm down here; But yonder, tho' heaven smiles clear, Bright winds blow, and silent and slow The vaporous Clouds sail by. For the branches, that here and there Grow yellow in autumn air, Are parted; and through the rent Of a flower-enwoven tent, The round blue eye of the peaceful sky Shows tearless, quiet, and fair. Face upward, calmly I rest As the leaf that lies dead on my breast; And the only sound I hear Is a rivulet tinkling near, And falling asleep in the woodland deep Like a fluttering bird in a nest. My mood would be full of grace As an eremite's peaceful face, And I should slumber away The delicate dreamful day, Save for Shapes that swim thro' the silence dim Of the blue ethereal space! I close my eyes in vain, In a pensive, poetic pain: Even then, to the gurgling glee Of the Brook I cannot see, Silent and slow they glide and they go O'er the bright still blank of the brain! With a motion wind-bequeath'd, Fantastically wreathed, They disturb my Soul,—as the beat Of the pale Moon's silvern feet Broke the sleep forlorn of the Sea new-born, Till it audibly stirr'd and breathed. White as a flock of sheep, Slender and soft and deep, With a radiance mild and faint As the smile of a pictured Saint, Or the light that flies from a mother's eyes On the face of a babe asleep! Yonder with dripping hair, Is Aphrodite the fair, Fresh from the foam, whose dress Enfleeces her loveliness, But melts like mist from the limbs sun-kiss'd That are kindling unaware! One, like a Titan cold, With banner about him roll'd, Bereft of sense, and hurl'd To the wondrous under-world, And drifting down, with a weedy crown, Some miraculous River old. One like a bank of snows, Which flushes to crimson, and glows; One like a goddess tall In a violet robe;—and all Have a motion that seems like the motion of dreams,— A dimly disturb'd repose;— A motion such as you see In the pictured divinity By the touch of an artist thrown On a Naiad sculptured in stone, For ever and ever about to quiver To a frighten'd flush, and flee! Beautiful, stately, slow, The pageants changefully grow; And in my bewilder'd brain Comes the distinct refrain Of the stately speech and the mighty reach Of Songs made long ago. Into my heart there throng Rich melodies worshipp'd long: The epic of Troy divine, Milton's majestical line, The palfrey pace and the glittering grace Of Spenser's magical song. Do whatever I may, I cannot shake them away; They are haunting voices that move Like the wondrous shapes above; Stately and slow they come and they go, Like measured words when we pray. When the troublous motion sublime Of the Clouds and the answering rhyme, Ceasing, leave now and again A pause in the hush'd heart, then The brook bursts in with a pastoral din, A gurgling lyrical chime! Oh! sweet, very sweet, to lie Pensive, I know not why, And to fashion magical swarms Of poet-created Forms In the pageants dumb that go and come Above in a windless sky! For yonder, a dark Ship furls Sails by an Island of pearls, And crafty Ulysses steers Through the white-tooth'd waves, and hears The liquid song of the syren throng, That beckon through golden curls. Tis faded away, and lo! The Grecian tents, like snow, And a brazen Troy afar, Whence Helen glitters a star; And the tents reveal the glimmering steel Of the gathering Greeks below! In fierce, precipitate haste From a golden gate are chased A shadowy Adam and Eve; And within the Gate they leave, Doth a sunbeam stand like the angel's brand, To illumine the azure waste. The sunbeam fading, behold A huge Tree tipp'd with gold, And a naked Eve beneath, With the apple raised to her teeth; While round and round the Snake coils, wound In many a magical fold. Oppress'd with fanciful fears, Trembling with unshed tears, I droop my eyes, until The notes of the lyrical rill Are shaken like rain on my eyelids twain, And another pageant appears. Far, far away, snow-white, Full of a silvern light, Beauteous, and yet so small They are scarce perceived at all, See Una guide her Lamb, by the side Of the mounted Red-Cross Knight. Then, to meet a far foe, speeds The Knight over azure meads, While threatening Dragons, hordes Of Satyrs, and traitor swords, Assail the Maid, but tremble afraid At the milk-white Lamb she leads! And she wanders undismay'd Through vistas of sun and shade; Over a mountain's brow She shines like a star; and now She fading is seen in the depths dark-green Of a mimical forest glade,— Which, opening flower-like, shows A Garden of crimson repose, Of lawns ambrosial, Streams that flash as they fall, In the innermost fold an arbour of gold Like the yellow core of a rose. On the verge of this fairy land Doth mailèd Sir Guyon stand, And bending his bloody plume 'Neath portals of snowy bloom, He enters the place with a pallid face, Breathless, and sword in hand. Oh! is it not sweet, sweet, sweet, To lie in this green retreat, In a beautiful dim half-dream Like a god on a hill; and seem A part of the fair strange shapes up there,— With the wood-scents round my feet? But shadows lengthen around, And the dew is dim on the ground; And hush'd, to list to the tune Of the coming stars and moon, The brook doth creep thro' the umbrage deep With cooler, quieter sound. Homeward;—but when the pale Moon filleth her silver sail, I shall sit alone with a book 'Neath another heaven, and look On the spiritual gleam and the cloudy dream Of Milton's majestical tale; Or wandering side by side With Una, through forests wide, Watch her beauty increase To heavenly patience and peace, While the Lamb of light licks her hand snow-white, And watches her face, meek-eyed! Or, 'mid trumpets murmuring loud, The waving of banners proud, And the rattle of horses' hooves, See the Grecian host—as it moves Its glittering powers to the Trojan towers, That dissolve away, as a Cloud! CUCKOO SONG. O Kitty Bell, 'twas sweet, I swear, To wander in the spring together, When buds were blowing everywhere, And it was golden weather! And down the lanes beside the farm You roam'd beside me, tripping lightly,— Blushing you hung upon my arm, And the small gloved hand press'd tightly! . . . And the orchis sprang In the scented meadow, And the throstle sang In the greenwood shadow; And your eyes were bright With happy dew,— Could I doubt a light So divinely blue, When you kiss'd and sighed ‘I will be true’? . . . Cuckoo! Though far and wide The brown bird cried— ‘Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!’ O Kitty Bell, the cry seem'd sweet, For you were kind, and flowers were springing; The dusty willow in the heat Its woolly bells were swinging, And in its boll the linnet brown Finish'd her nest with wool and feather, And we had thoughts of nestling down, In the farm by the mill, together. . . . And over the hill The breeze was blowing, And the arms of the mill Kept coming and going; And who but Love Was between us two, When around and above The flittermice flew, And as night drew nigh, You swore to be true? . . . Cuckoo! I heard the cry From woods hard by— ‘Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!’ O Kitty Bell, 'tis spring again, But all the face of things looks iller; The nests are built in wood and lane, But you are nested with the miller. And other lovers kiss and swear, While I behold in scorn and pity, For ‘all,’ I cry, ‘is false and fair,’ And curse the cuckoo and Kitty. . . . And over the hill The breeze is blowing, And the arms of the mill Keep coming and going; And the hidden bird Is singing anew The warning I heard When I trusted you; And I sicken and sigh, With my heart thrill'd through . . . Cuckoo! Wherever I fly I hear the cry— ‘Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!’ THE WHITE DEER. [[I.]] The hunter leaps from slumber, And quits his cottage door; Days and nights without number, Forth he has fared before. Still the old quest is sorest, The hunter's heart is cold; He seeks the deer of the forest With mystical horns of gold. Dim as a dream it glimmers Through the dark forest glades, Passes with starlight tremors, Trances the sight and fades. By the dim quiet fountain Lies the print of its form; Up mid the cloud of the mountain Cries its voice in the storm! Not a bullet or arrow Hath reached its bosom yet, And though the ways are narrow, It steps through noose and net. The hunter's cheek is sickly, Time hath silvered his hair, His weary breath comes quickly, He trembleth in despair. Many a one before him Hath been a hunter here, Then, with the sad sky o'er him, Died in quest of the deer. See, the day is dying! See, the hunter is spent! Under the dark trees lying; Perishing ill content. Ev'n as his sad eyes darken, Stirs the boughs of the glade, He gathers his strength to hearken, Peering into the shade. And lo, with a soft light streaming, Stainless and dimly bright, Stands with its great eyes gleaming The mystical deer, snow-white! Closer it comes up creeping, With burning beautiful eyes— Then, as he falls back sleeping, Touches his lips and flies! II. The live foot ever fleeing, It comes to the dying and dead— Oh, hope in the darkness of being! Methinks I hear thy tread. Around, above me, and under, God's forest is closing dim; I chase the mystical wonder, Footsore and weary of limb. Down in the dim recesses, Up on the heights untrod, Eluding our dreams and guesses, Slips the secret of God. Only seen by the dying, In the last spectral pain; Just as the breath is flying— Flashing and fading again. White mystery, might I view thee! Bright wonder, might we meet! Ever as I pursue thee, I see the print of thy feet. Ever those feet are roaming, Ever we follow in quest; While thou hauntest the gloaming Never a soul shall rest. CONVENT-ROBBING. (OLD STYLE.) May Margaret felt a cold cloud come down on her— They made her a nun and put a black gown on her; Young Roland went white Thro' the winter moonlight, Looming tall in the breath of the frost every night, And gazed at the Convent, and plann'd how to win her there, And his cheek gather'd dew till the dawn, and grew thinner there. ‘A ruse, ho, a ruse!’ cried his brother, Clerk John, to him,— When in vain both the monks and the leeches had gone to him,— ‘Cease to fume and to frown, Close thine eyes, lie thee down, Stretch thee straight on a bier in thy chilly death-gown; The great bell shall ring, and thy house gather gloom in it, While I'll to the Convent, and beg thee a tomb in it!’ The Convent bell tolls, hung with black are the porches there, Come tall black pall-bearers and pages with torches there, Then the bier,—and thereon The pale youth dead and gone! And behind, grim as Death, weeping sore, goes Clerk John! And the chapel is dark, as the bearers pace slow in it, And all the black nuns stands with lights in a row in it. Ah! chill is the chapel, the great bell chimes weary there, Black bearers, black nuns, and black pages look dreary there; The youth lies in death, Not a syllable saith; But the tiny frost-cloud on his lips is his breath!— And the shroud round his limbs hath bright armour of steel in it And his hand, gloved in mail, grips the sword it can feel in it! Ho, she screameth,—May Margaret! kneels by the side of him !— ‘White Mary above, be the guardian and guide of him! They plighted us twain, Yet we parted in pain, And ah! that so soon I should clasp him again!’ Wan, wan, is her cheek, with dim torchlight the while on it— Does she dream? . . Has the face changed? . . and is there a smile on it? She holds his cold hand to her heart, and doth call on him, Drop by drop, warm and scented, her tender tears fall on him; The nuns, sable-gown'd, Chanting low, stand around; Clerk John bites his lips, with his eyes on the ground . . ‘Dear heart, that we meet but in woe such as this again!’ Then she kisses his lips!—Does she dream? . . Did he kiss again? Who opens the door with a terrible shout at once?— A great wind sweeps in, and the lights are blown out at once! The Abbess screams low, Moan the nuns in a row, Thro' the porch sweeps the wind and the sleet and the snow, But the moon thro' the quaint-colour'd windows is beaming now,— And wonderful shapes round the bier gather gleaming now!— The sable pall-bearers and pages are new-arrayed, In armour that glitters like golden dew arrayed! How chill the moon glows! How it blows! how it snows! Yet May Margaret's cheek is as red as a rose! And ‘a miracle,’ murmurs the Abbess so holy now, For shiningly vested the dead rises slowly now! He draweth May Margaret's sweet blushing cheek to him, She kisses him softly, yet strives not to speak to him; The nuns sable-gown'd Shiver dismally round, As he lifteth the great sable pall from the ground, And turneth it deftly, and flingeth it over her,— And a mantle of ermine doth clothe her and cover her! On the floor of the chapel their foot-falls sound hollow now, Clerk John and the rest very silently follow now . . . Hark! is it the beat Of horses' feet? Or the wild wind whistling in snow and in sleet? Down the aisles of the chapel the wild echoes die away, While fast in the snow-storm the happy ones hie away! ‘Saints,’ crieth the Abbess, ‘pour down your dole on us! To take our sweet sister the devil hath stole on us!’ And the nuns, in a row, Murmur slyly and low— ‘Ah! would he might come unto us also!’ And they look at the bier, with the tingle of sin on them, And the moon blushes faintly, still glimmering in on them. Ay, fast in the snow-storm gallop the lovers now! Young Roland's warm castle their merriment covers now! To the bower they have run, For the bridal is done, And the jolly old priest hath made them one: ‘May all who love true,’ cries the youth, ‘win such kisses, dear, Die such death,—and be tomb'd in a bower such as this is, dear!’ THE BALLAD OF THE WAYFARER. (OLD STYLE.) O'er the cheerless common, Where the bleak winds blow, Wanders the wan Woman; Waysore and weary, Through the dark and dreary Drift-bed of the Snow. On her pale pinch'd features snowing 'tis and sleeting, By her side her little Son runs with warm heart beating, Clinging to her wet robe, while she wails repeating: ‘Further, my child, further—further let us go!’ Fleet the Boy doth follow, Wondering at her woe; On, with footfall hollow, O'er the pathway jagged Crawls she wet and ragged, Restless and slow. ‘Mother!’ now he murmurs, mid the tempest's crying, ‘Mother, rest a little—I am faint with flying— Mother, rest a little!’ Still she answers sighing, ‘Further, child, and faster—further let us go! But now she is sitting On a stone, and lo! Dark her brows are knitting, While the Child, close clinging To her raiment wringing, Shivers at the snow. ‘Tell me of my father! for I never knew him Is he dead or living, are we flying to him?’ ‘Peace, my child!’ she answers, and the voice thrills through him; ‘When we wander further—further!—thou shalt know.’ (Wild wind of December, Blow, wind, blow!—) ‘Oh, but I remember! In my mind I gather Pictures of my father, And a gallant show. Tell me, mother, tell me—did we always wander? Was the world once brighter? In some town out yonder Dwelt we not contented?’ Sad she seems to ponder, Sighing ‘I will tell thee-when we further go.’ ‘Oh, but Mother, listen! We were rich, I know! (How his bright eyes glisten!) We were merry people, In a town with a steeple, Long, long ago; In a gay room dwelling, where your face shone brightly, And a brave man brought us food and presents nightly. Tell me, ‘twas my father?’ Now her face looms whitely, While she shivers moaning, ‘Peace, let us go!’ How the clouds gather! How the winds blow! ‘Who was my father? Was he Prince or Lord there, With a train and a sword there? Mother, I will know!— I have dreamt so often of those gallant places; There were banners waving—I could see the faces— Take me to my father!’ cries he with embraces, While she shivers moaning, ‘No, child, no!’ While the child is speaking, Forth the moon steals slow, From the black cloud breaking, Shining white and eerie On the wayside weary, Shrouded white in snow. On the heath behind them, 'gainst the dim sky lying, Looms the Gallows blackly, in the wild wind sighing. To her feet the woman springs! with fierce shriek crying— ‘See! Oh, God in heaven! . . . Woe, child, woe!’ (Blow, wind of December, Blow, wind, blow!—) ‘Thou canst not remember— Thou wert but a blossom Suckled on my bosom, Years, years ago! Thy father stole to feed us; our starving faces stung him; In yonder town behind us, they seized him and they hung him! They murdered him on Gallows-Tree, and to the ravens flung him! Faster, my child, faster—faster let us go!’ IN SPRING-TIME. Sweet, sing a song of the May to me, Sweeten the lingering hours! Soft comes her whisper each day to me, See, thro' the green and the gray, to me; Thrills the faint flame of the flowers. For the spell of the winter is ended, The rainbow is seen thro' the showers, And the May, by fair spirits attended, Shall smile up the skies, and be ours. . . Afar away yonder her foot cometh slow to us— She steals up the south, with her cheeks all aglow, to us! The blue waters tremble! the rain singeth low to us! Green stir the blossoming bowers! THE FISHERMAN. The sea is moaning, the little one cries, In child-bed sorrow the Mother lies, And the Fisher fisheth afar away In the morning gray. The drift is dark as the dawn appears: Is it the moan of the wind he hears— Is it the splash of the ocean foam, Or a cry from home? He fisheth there that the babe may eat— The wind is whistling in shroud and sheet; He looketh down from the side of his bark On the waters dark. Sees he the gleam of the foam-flake there, Or a white, white face in its floating hair?— Sea-weeds salt that are shoreward drifted, Or arms uplifted? His heart is heavy, his lips are set, He sighs as he draggeth in his net— A goodly gift from the waters wild To Mother and Child! The Dawn gleams cold as he homeward flies The boat is laden, the new born cries, But the wraith of the mother fades far away In the morning gray! THE CHURCHYARD. (A GENRE PICTURE.) How slowly creeps the hand of Time On the old clock's green-mantled face! Yea, slowly as those ivies climb, The hours roll round with patient pace; The drowsy rooks caw on the tower, The tame doves hover round and round; Below, the slow grass hour by hour Makes green God's sleeping ground. All moves, but nothing here is swift; The grass grows deep, the green boughs shoot; From east to west the shadows drift; The earth feels heavenward underfoot; The slow stream through the bridge doth stray With water-lilies on its marge, And slowly, piled with scented hay, Creeps by the silent barge. All stirs, but nothing here is loud: The cushat broods, the cuckoo cries; Faint, far up, under a white cloud, The lark trills soft to earth and skies; And underneath the green graves rest; And through the place, with slow footfalls, With snowy cambric on his breast, The old gray Vicar crawls. And close at hand, to see him come, Clustering at the playground gate, The urchins of the schoolhouse, dumb And bashful, hang the head and wait; The little maidens curtsey deep, The boys their forelocks touch meanwhile, The Vicar sees them, half asleep, And smiles a sleepy smile. Slow as the hand on the clock's face, Slow as the white cloud in the sky, He cometh now with tottering pace To the old vicarage hard by; Smothered it stands in ivy leaves, Laurels and yews make dark the ground; The swifts that built beneath the eaves Wheel in still circles round. And from the portal, green and dark, He glances at the church-clock old— Gray soul! why seek his eyes to mark The creeping of that finger cold? He cannot see, but still as stone He pauses, listening for the chime, And hears from that green tower intone The eternal voice of Time. SEA-WASH. Wherefore so cold, O Day, That gleamest far away O'er the dim line where mingle heaven and ocean, While fishing-boats lie netted in the gray, And still smooth waves break in their shoreward motion— Wherefore so cold, so cold? O say, dost thou behold A Face o'er which the rock-weed droopeth sobbing, A Face just stirred within a sea-cave old By the green water's throbbing? Wherefore, O Fisherman, So full of care and wan, This weary, weary morning shoreward flying While stooping downward, darkly thou dost scan That which below thee in thy boat is lying? Wherefore so full of care! What dost thou shoreward bear Caught in thy net's moist meshes, as a token? Ah! can it be the ring of golden hair Whereby my heart is broken? Wherefore so still, O Sea? That washest wearilie Under the lamp lit in the fisher's dwelling, Holding the secret of thy deeps from me, Whose heart would break so sharply at the telling? Wherefore so still, so still? Say, in thy sea-cave chill Floats she forlorn with foam-bells round her breaking, While the wet Fisher lands and climbs the hill To hungry babes awaking? EARTH AND THE SOUL. ‘Child of my bosom, babe of my bearing; Why dost thou turn from me now thou art old? Why, like a wild bird for passage preparing, Shrink from my touch with a tremor of cold?’ ‘Mother, I dread thee! mother, I fear thee! Darkness and silence are hid in thy core; Deep is thy voice, and I tremble to hear thee; Let me begone, for thou lov'st me no more!’ ‘Love thee not, dearest one, son of my splendour, Love thee not? How shall I smile thee a sign? See my soft arms, they are kindly and tender! See my fond face, flushing upward to thine!’ ‘Mother, thy face looketh dreadful and ghastly! Mother, thy breath is as frost on my hair! Hold me not, stay me not, time speedeth fastly, Look, a kind Hand beckons softly up there!’ ‘Child, yet a while ere thy cruel feet fare on! See, in my lap lie the flowers of the May; See, in my hair twine the roses of Sharon; See, on my breast gleam the gems of Cathay!’ ‘Mother, I know thou art queenly and splendid, Yet is there death in the blush of thy bloom; Touch me not, mother—my childhood is ended, Dark is thy shadow and dreadful thy doom.’ ‘Child, 'twas I bare thee! child, 'twas I fashioned Those gleaming limbs, and those ringlets of light, Made thee a spirit sublime and impassioned, Read thee the Book of the stars night by night, Led thy frail feet when they failed sorrow-laden, Whispered thee wonders of death and of birth, Made thee the heir of the garden of Aiden, Child, it was I, thy poor mother, the Earth!’ ‘Mother, I know it! and oh, how I loved thee, When on thy bosom I leapt as a child, Shared each still pleasure that filled thee and moved thee, Thrilled to the bliss of thy face when it smiled. Yea, but I knew not thy glory was fleeing, Not till that night thou didst read me the scroll, Sobbed in my ear the dark sccret of Being; Mother, I wept—thy fair creature, the Soul!’ ‘Child, wherefore weep? Since the secret is spoken, Lie in mine arms—I will rock thee to rest; Ne'er shall thy slumber be troubled and broken, Low will I sing to thee, held to my breast. Oh, it is weary to wander and wander; Child of my fashioning, stay with me here.’ ‘Mother, I cannot; 'tis brighter up yonder; Dark is thy brow with the shadow I fear!’ ‘Child, yet one kiss! yet one kiss, ere thou flyest!’ ‘Nay, for thy lips have the poison of death!’ ‘Child, one embrace!’ ‘Nay, all vainly thou criest; I see thy face darken, I shrink at thy breath.’ ‘Go, I have wept for thee, toiled for thee, borne with thee, Pardoned thee freely each taint and each stain. Take the last love of my bosom forlorn with thee— Seek the great Void for a kinder in vain!’ ‘Mother, I go; but if e'er I discover That which I seek in those regions untrod, I will come back to thee; softly bend over Thy pillow, and whisper the secret of God.’ ‘Child, thou wilt find me asleep in black raiment. Dead by the side of the infinite Sea; Drop one immortelle above me for payment Of all the wild love I have wasted on thee!’ A CURL. As these verses bear a certain superficial resemblance, in subject, to Mr. Tennyson's Poem, ‘A Ringlet,’ it may be as well to state that they appeared in print several years before the publication of ‘Enoch Arden, and other Poems.’ (A BOY'S POEM.) See! what a treasure rare I hold with fingers aglow! —'Tis full of the bright Subdued sunlight Which shone in the scented hair Of a maiden I once held fair; And I puzzle my brains to know If the heart of the beautiful girl Hath kept the light of the Long Ago, As long as the yellow curl? What matter? Why, little or none! She is nought to me now, understand; But I feel less sad Than tearfully glad, And a passionate thrill hath run Through my veins, like a flash of the sun,— That with so unheeding a hand I can grasp a small part of the gold Which dazzled my wits, when I planned and planned For the love of that maiden, of old. See! I crush it with finger and thumb, Half in cruelty, half in jest.— As she lies asleep, Doth a shudder creep Thro' her heart, and render it numb? Doth a sorrowful whisper come From afar, while her lord is at rest By her side, and none else are by? Doth she shiver away from her husband's breast, And hide her face, and cry? Is her heart quite withered and sere? Are the pledges forgotten yet, That, with blushing face, In a secret place, She breathed in my burning ear, In the morning of the year, When, after long parting, we met By the Sea, on the shadowy lawn, And spake till the sunset faded to jet, And moon and stars made a dawn? As she lies in her wifely place, The wings of her white soul furled, Does the cheek at rest On her husband's breast Grow scorch'd with the hot disgrace Of the kisses I rain'd on her face, When the mists of the night upcurled From the ocean that night of June, And make a glamour, wherein the world Seemed close to the stars and moon? By this ringlet of yellow hair, Still full of the light forlorn Of that parting spot! Hath she quite forgot The passionate love she bare, And the hope she promised to share, When the ringlet of gold was shorn, And the flowers felt the sun on the soil, And the firefly stars went out in the morn, And I hurried back to my toil? I could crush it under my heel! Hath she forgotten the clear Vision of fame That died, when her shame Made my wild brain totter and reel? Hath she a heart to feel?— False to her vows in a year! False and hollow as Hell! False to the voice that warned in her ear! And false to her God as well! This curl that she gave to me Fell over her brow of snow, So 'twas near the bright Spiritual light That burned in the brain—and see! I am kissing it tenderly! She is asking for mercy, I know; So I kiss it again and again, For I know some charm makes the wild kiss glow Like fire thro' the woman's brain! She cannot choose but atone! By the brow where this curl once gleam'd! She must in sin thought, Against him who bought The heart already mine own, And left me weeping alone. 'Tis a charm, and my loss is redeemed! And the sin 'gainst her lord will be— To remember how close to the stars we seemed That night in the mists by the Sea! She will look on her husband's face, She will kiss him on the cheek— She will kiss, she will smile; And all the while, In thought no other may trace, She'll be back in that perfumed place, Hearing the words that I speak, Vowing the vow I believe, While the sunset dies with a purple streak, 'Neath the whitening star of eve. And the voice of the waves will bar All sweeter sounds from her ears, She'll be under the moon Of that night of June, And the motion of moon and star Will trouble her from afar; And then, when the silver spheres Fade fitfully out of the skies, And the red dawn breaks, she will wake in tears, And shrink from her husband's eyes! And in time, when again and again I have kissed the magical gold, Those same gross eyes Will be open and wise, And his heart will be feverish pain, And a doubt will arise in his brain; And ere she is grown very old, He will know she is frail as foam,— He will see the light of that night in her cold Face,—and my curse strikes home! For perchance in her yearning she may Be bewildered and brought to blame, By a new delight So like that night With its mimical glamour of day, That she cannot shake it away; And following it once more, She will take a path of shame, While the man blushes red at his darken'd door As the children utter her name. See! my passionate lips are warm On the curl, in a cruel bliss— In day or mirk The charm would work!— While she dreams of that night till her form Is caught in the eddies of storm! There's a devil impels me to kiss, And my blood boils to and fro; She asks for mercy! shall mercy like this Be given my darling? . . . No! With the world, as it ebbs and flows, My heart is in jarring tune; Let the memory Of her beauty be Furled in a soft repose Round my heart, like the leaves of a rose. The faith, which has faded too soon, I bury with this last cry; For the curl, still bright with that night of June, Lo! I tenderly put it by! LOVE AND TIME. This is the place, as husht and dead As when I saw it long ago; Down the dark walk with shadows spread I wander slow. The tangled sunlight, cold and clear, Steals frost-white through the boughs around. There is no warmth of summer here, No summer sound. Darnel and nettle, as I pass, Choke the dim ways, and in the bowers Gather the weeds and the wild grass Instead of flowers. O life! O time! O days that die! O days that live within the mind! Here did we wander, she and I, Together twined. We passed out of the great broad walk, Beyond the emerald lawns we strayed, We lingered slow in tender talk Along the shade. And then the great old maze we found, And smiling entered it unseen, Half sad, half glad, went round and round Thro' windings green. In the bright centre of the maze A rose-bush grew, a dial gleam'd; She pluck'd a rose . . . with blissful gaze Watch'd it, and dreamed. O life! O time! O days divine! O dreams that keep the soul astir! That hour eternity was mine, Looking at her! This is the place. I wander slow. Dark are the shades of shrub and tree, The dial stands, the leaves lie low, But where is she? O life! O time! O birds and flowers! O withering leaves upon the bough! Alas, she measures not her hours With roses now. The dial stands—the dark days roll— From year to year the roses spring— Eternity is in my soul, Remembering. The dial stands—the summer goes— All changeth, nothing dieth, here! And all reneweth like a rose, From year to year. Undertones. (1864.) POET'S PROLOGUE. TO DAVID IN HEAVEN. ‘Quo diversus abis?’ ‘Quem Di diligunt, adolescens moritur.’ I Lo! the slow moon roaming Thro' fleecy mists of gloaming, Furrowing with pearly edge the jewel-powder'd sky! Lo, the bridge moss-1 den, Arch'd like foot of maiden, And on the bridge, in silence, looking upward, you and I! Lo, the pleasant season Of reaping and of mowing— The round still moon above,—beneath, the river duskily flowing! II Violet colour'd shadows, Blown from scented meadows, Float o'er us to the pine-wood dark from yonder dim corn-ridge; The little river gushes Thro' shady sedge and rushes, And gray gnats murmur o'er the pools, beneath the mossy bridge;— And you and I stand darkly, O'er the keystone leaning, And watch the pale mesmeric moon, in the time of gleaners and gleaning. III Do I dream, I wonder? As, sitting sadly under A lonely roof in London, thro' the grim square pane I gaze? Here of you I ponder, In a dream, and yonder The still streets seem to stir and breathe beneath the white moon's rays. By the vision cherish'd, By the battle bravéd, Do I but dream a hopeless dream, in the city that slew you, David? IV Is it fancy also, That the light which falls so Faintly upon the stony street below me as I write, Near tall mountains passes Thro' churchyard weeds and grasses. Barely a mower's mile away from that small bridge, to-night? And, where you are lying,— Grass and flowers above you— Is mingled with your sleeping face, as calm as the hearts that love you? V Poet gentle-hearted, Are you then departed, And have you ceased to dream the dream we loved of old so well? Has the deeply cherish'd Aspiration perish'd, And are you happy, David, in that heaven where you dwell? Have you found the secret We, so wildly, sought for, And is your soul enswath'd, at last, in the singing robes you fought for? VI In some heaven star-lighted, Are you now united Unto the poet-spirits that you loved, of English race? Is Chatterton still dreaming? And, to give it stately seeming, Has the music of his last strong song passed into Keats's face? Is Wordsworth there? and Spenser? Beyond the grave's black portals, Can the grand eye of Milton see the glory he sang to mortals? VII You at least could teach me, Could your dear voice reach me Where I sit and copy out for men my soul's strange speech, Whether it be bootless, Profitless, and fruitless,— The weary aching upward strife to heights we cannot reach, The fame we seek in sorrow, The agony we forego not, The haunting singing sense that makes us climb—whither we know not. VIII Must it last for ever, The passionate endeavour, Ay, have ye, there in heaven, hearts to throb and still aspire? In the life you know now, Render'd white as snow now, Do fresher glory-heights arise, and beckon higher—higher? Are you dreaming, dreaming, Is your soul still roaming, Still gazing upward as we gazed, of old in the autumn gloaming? IX Lo, the book I hold here, In the city cold here! I hold it with a gentle hand and love it as I may; Lo, the weary moments! Lo, the icy comments! And lo, false Fortune's knife of gold swift-lifted up to slay! Has the strife no ending? Has the song no meaning? Linger I, idle as of old, while men are reaping or gleaning? X Upward my face I turn to you, I long for you, I yearn to you, The spectral vision trances me to utt'rance wild and weak; It is not that I mourn you, To mourn you were to scorn you, For you are one step nearer to the beauty singers seek. But I want, and cannot see you, I seek and cannot find you, And, see! I touch the book of songs you tenderly left behind you! XI Ay, me! I bend above it, With tearful eyes, and love it, With tender hand I touch the leaves, but cannot find you there! Mine eyes are haunted only By that gloaming sweetly lonely, The shadows on the mossy bridge, the glamour in the air! I touch the leaves, and only See the glory they retain not— The moon that is a lamp to Hope, who glorifies what we gain not! XII The aching and the yearning, The hollow, undiscerning, Uplooking want I still retain, darken the leaves I touch— Pale promise, with much sweetness Solemnizing incompleteness, But ah, you knew so little then—and now you know so much! By the vision cherish'd, By the battle bravéd, Have you, in heaven, shamed the song, by a loftier music, David? XIII I, who loved and knew you, In the city that slew you, Still hunger on, and thirst, and climb, proud-hearted and alone: Serpent-fears enfold me, Syren-visions hold me, And, like a wave, I gather strength, and gathering strength, I moan; Yea, the pale moon beckons, Still I follow, aching, And gather strength, only to make a louder moan, in breaking! XIV Tho' the world could turn from you, This, at least, I learn from you: Beauty and Truth, tho' never found, are worthy to be sought, The singer, upward-springing, Is grander than his singing, And tranquil self-sufficing joy illumes the dark of thought. This, at least, you teach me, In a revelation: That gods still snatch, as worthy death, the soul in its aspiration. XV And I think, as you thought, Poesy and Truth ought Never to lie silent in the singer's heart on earth; Tho' they be discarded, Slighted, unrewarded,— Tho', unto vulgar seeming, they appear of little worth,— Yet tender brother-singers, Young or not yet born to us, May seek there, for the singer's sake, that love which sweeteneth scorn to us! XVI While I sit in silence, Comes from mile on mile hence, From English Keats's Roman grave, a voice that swectens toil! Think you, no fond creatures Draw comfort from the features Of Chatterton, pale Phäethon, hurled down to sunless soil? Scorch'd with sunlight lying, Eyes of sunlight hollow, But, see! upon the lips a gleam of the chrism of Apollo! XVII Noble thought produces Noble ends and uses, Noble hopes are part of Hope wherever she may be, Noble thought enhances Life and all its chances, And noble self is noble song,—all this I learn from thee! And I learn, moreover, 'Mid the city's strife too, That such faint song as sweetens Death can sweeten the singer's life too! XVIII Lo, my Book!—I hold it In weary hands, and fold it Unto my heart, if only as a token I aspire; And, by song's assistance, Unto your dim distance, My soul uplifted is on wings, and beckon'd higher, nigher, By the sweeter wisdom You return unspeaking, Though endless, hopeless, be the search, we exalt our souls in seeking. XIX Higher, yet, and higher, Ever nigher, ever nigher, To the glory we conceive not, let us toil and strive and strain!— The agonizëd yearning, The imploring and the burning, Grown awfuller, intenser, at each vista we attain, And clearer, brighter, growing, Up the gulfs of heaven wander, Higher, higher yet, and higher, to the Mystery we ponder! XX Yea, higher yet, and higher, Ever nigher, ever nigher, While men grow small by stooping and the reaper piles the grain,— Can it then be bootless, Profitless and fruitless, The weary aching upward search for what we never gain? Is there not awaiting Rest and golden weather, Where, passionately purified, the singers may meet together? XXI Up! higher yet, and higher, Ever nigher, ever nigher, Thro' voids that Milton and the rest beat still with seraph-wings; Out thro' the great gate creeping Where God hath put his sleeping— A dewy cloud detaining not the soul that soars and sings, Up! higher yet, and higher, Fainting nor retreating, Beyond the sun, beyond the stars, to the far bright realm of meeting! XXII O Mystery! O Passion! To sit on earth, and fashion, What floods of music visibled may fill that fancied place! To think, the least that singeth, Aspireth and upspringeth, May weep glad tears on Keats's breast and look in Milton's face! When human power and failure Are equalized for ever, And the one great Light that haloes all is the passionate bright endeavour! XXIII But ah, that pale moon roaming Thro' fleecy mists of gloaming, Furrowing with pearly edge the jewel-powder'd sky, And ah, the days departed With your friendship gentle-hearted, And ah, the dream we dreamt that night, together you and I! Is it fasmon'd wisely, To help us or to blind us, That at each height we gain we turn, and behold a heaven behind us? THE UNDERTONES. [Thou Fame! who makest of the singer's Life] Thou Fame! who makest of the singer's Life, Faint with the sweetness of its own desire, A statue of Narcissus, still and fair For evermore, and bending evermore Over its beauteous image mirrorëd In the swift current of our human days, Eternally in act to clasp and kiss! O Fame, teach thou this flesh and blood to love Some beauteous counterpart, and while it bends, Tremulously gazing on the image, blow Thy trump aloud, and freeze it into stone! I. PROTEUS; OR, A PRELUDE. 1. Into the living elements of things I, Proteus, mingle, seeking strange disguise: I track the Sun-god on an eagle's wings, Or look at horror thro' a murderer's eyes, In shape of hornëd beast my shadow glides Among broad-leavëd flowers that blow 'neath Afric tides. 2. Lo! I was stirring in the leaves that shaded The Garden where the Man and Woman smiled: I saw them later, raimentless, degraded, The apple sour upon their tongues; beguiled By the sweet wildness of the Woman's tears, I dropt in dew upon her lips, and stole Under her heart, a stirring human Soul, The blood within her tingling in mine ears; And as I lay, I heard a voice that cried ‘Lo, Proteus, the unborn, shall wake to be Heir of the Woman's sorrow, yet a guide Conducting back to immortality— The spirit of the leaves of Paradise Shall lift him upward, to aspire and rise!’ Then sudden, I was conscious that I lay Under a heaven that gleam'd afar away:— I heard the Man and Woman weeping, The green leaves rustling, and the Serpent creeping, The roar of beasts, the song of birds, the chime Of elements in sudden strife sublime, And overhead I saw the starry Tree, Eternity, Put forth the blossom Time. 3. A wind of ancient prophecy swept down, And wither'd up my beauty—where I lay On Paris' bosom, in the Trojan town; Troy vanish'd, and I wander'd far away,— Till, lying on a Virgin's breast, I gazed Thro' infant eyes, and saw, as in a dream, The great god Pan whom I had raised and praised, Float huge, unsinew'd, down a mighty stream, With leaves and lilies heap'd about his head, And a weird music hemming him around, While, dropping from his nerveless fingers dead, A brazen sceptre plunged with hollow sound: A trackless Ocean wrinkling tempest-wing'd Open'd its darkness for the clay unking'd; Moreover, as he floated on at rest, With lips that flutter'd still in act to speak, An eagle, swooping down upon his breast, Pick'd at his songless lips with golden beak. 4. There was a sound of fear and lamentation, The forests wail'd, the stars and moon grew pale, The air grew cloudy with the desolation Of gods that fell from realmless thrones like hail; But as I gazed, the great God Pan awaking, Lookt in the Infant's happy eyes and smiled, And smiling died; and like a sunbeam breaking From greenwood olden, rose a presence mild In exhalation from the clay, and stole Around the Infant in an auriole— When, gladden'd by the glory of the child, Dawn gleam'd from pole to pole. 5. And, lo! a shape with pallid smile divine Wander'd in Palestine; And Adam's might was stately in his eyes, And Eve's wan sweetness glimmer'd on his cheek, And when he open'd heavenly lips to speak, I heard, disturbing Pilate into sighs, The rustle of those leaves in Paradise! Then all was dark, the earth, and air, and sky, The sky was troubled and the earth was shaken, Beasts shriek'd, men shouted, and there came a cry— ‘My God, I am forsaken!’ But even then I smiled amid my tears, And saw in vision, down the future years, What time the cry still rung in heaven's dark dome, The likeness of his smile ineffable, Serenely dwell On Raphael, sunn'd by popes and kings at Rome, And Dante, singing in his Tuscan cell! 6. Suddenly, from the vapours of the north, Ice-bearded, snowy-visaged, Strength burst forth, Brandishing arms in death: 'Twas Ades, frighted from his seat in Hell By that pale smile of peace ineffable, That with a sunny life-producing breath, Wreathed summer round the foreheads of the Dead, And troubled Hell's weird silence into joy. And with a voice that rent the pole he said, ‘Lo, I am Thor, the mighty to destroy!’ The accents ran to water on his mouth, The pole was kindled to a fiery glow, A breath of summer floated from the south And melted him like snow. 7. Yea thus, thro' change on change, Haunted for ever by the leafy sound That sigh'd the Woman and the Man around, I, Proteus, range. A weary quest, a power to climb and soar, Yet never quit life's bitterness and starkness, A groping for God's hand amid the darkness, The day behind me and the night before, This is my task for evermore! I am the shadow of the inspiration Breath'd on the Man; I am the sense alone, That, generation upon generation, Empowers the sinful Woman to atone By giving angels to the grave and weeping Because she knows not whither they are going; I am the strife awake, the terror sleeping, The sorrow ever ebbing, ever flowing. Mine are the mighty names of power and worth The seekers of the vision that hath fled, I bear the Infant's smile about the earth, And put the Cross on the aspirant's head, I am the peace on holy men who die, I waft as sacrifice their fleeting breath— I am the change that is not change, for I Am deathless, being Death. 8. For, evermore I grow Wiser, with humbler power to feel and know; For, in the end I, Proteus, shall cast All wondrous shapes aside but one alone, And stand (while round about me in the Vast Earth, Sun, Stars, Moon, as snowflakes melt at last,) A Skeleton that, shadow'd by the Tree, Eternity, Holds in his hands the blossom Time full blown, And kneels before a Throne. II. ADES, KING OF HELL. 1 Beneath the caves where sunless loam Grows dim and reddens into gold; 'Neath the fat earth-seams, where the cold Rains thicken to the flowery foam Fringing blue streams in summer zones; Beneath the spheres where dead men's bones Change darkly thro' slow centuries to marl and glittering stones;— 2 Orb'd in that rayless realm, alone, Far from the realm of sun and shower, A palpable god with godlike power, I, Ades, dwelt upon a throne; Much darkness did my eyelids tire; But thro' my veins the hid Sun's fire Communicated impulse, hope, thought, passion, and desire. 3 Eternities of lonely reign, Full of faint dreams of day and night And the white glamour of starry light, Oppress'd my patience into pain; Upward I sent a voice of prayer That made a horror in the air: And ‘Ades craves a queen, O Zeus!’ shook heaven unaware. 4 The gods stopt short in full carouse, And listen'd. On the streams of Hell The whole effulgent conclave fell As in a glass. With soft-arch'd brows, And wings of dewy-tinctured dye, Pale Iris listen'd blushingly; And Heré sought the soul of Zeus with coldly eager eye. 5 Then the clear hyaline grew cold And dim before the Father's face; Gray meditation clothed the place; And rising up Zeus cried, ‘Behold!’— And on Olumpos' crystal wall, A kingly phantom cloudy and tall, Throned, sceptred, crown'd, was darkly apparition'd at the call. 6 ‘Behold him!’ Zeus the Father cried, With voice that shook my throne forlorn: Pale Hermes curl'd his lips in scorn, And Iris drew her bow aside: Artemis paled and did not speak; Sheer fear flush'd Aphrodité's cheek; And only owl-eyed Pallas look'd with pitying smile and meek. 7 A weary night thro' earth and air The shadow of my longing spread, And not a goddess answerëd. All nature darken'd at my prayer; Which darkness earth and air did shroud, No starrain'd light, but, pale and proud, With blue-edged sickle Artemis cut her slow path thro' cloud. 8 And when the weary dark was done, Beyond my sphere of realm upsprang, With smile that beam'd and harp that sang, Apollo piloting the Sun; And conscious of him shining o'er, I watch'd my black and watery floor Wherein the wondrous upper-world is mirror'd evermore. 9 When lo, there murmur'd on my brain, Like sound of distant waves, a sound That did my godlike sense confound And kiss'd my eyelids down in pain; And far above I heard the beat Of musically falling feet, Hurl'd by the echoes of the earth down to my brazen seat. 10 And I was 'ware that overhead Walk'd one whose very motion sent A sweet immortal wonderment Thro' the deep dwellings of the Dead, And flush'd the seams of cavern and mine To gleams of gold and diamond shine, And made the misty dews shoot up to kiss her feet divine. 11 By Zeus, the beat of those soft feet Thrill'd to the very roots of Hell, Troubling the mournful streams that fell Like snakes from out my brazen seat: Faint music reach'd me strange and slow, My conscious Throne gleam'd pale as snow, A beauteous vision vaguely fill'd the dusky glass below.— 12 When I beheld in that dark glass The phantom of a lonely maid, Who gather'd flowers in a green glade Knee-deep in dewy meadow-grass, And on a riverside. Behold, The sun that robed her round with gold, Mirror'd beneath me raylessly, loom'd white and round and cold. 13 Soft yellow hair that curl'd and clang Throbbed to her feet in softest showers, And as she went she gather'd flowers, And as she gather'd flowers she sang: It floated down my sulphurous eaves, That melody of flowers and leaves, Of vineyards, gushing purple wines, and yellow slanted sheaves. 14 Darkling I mutter'd, ‘It were choice Proudly to throne in solemn cheer So fair a queen, and ever to hear Such song from so divine a voice!’ And with the wish I upward breathed A mist of fire that swiftly seethed Thro' shuddering earth-seams overhead, and round her warm knees wreathed. 15 Whereon the caves of precious stones Grew bright as moonlight thrown on death, And red gold brighten'd, and the breath Drew greenness moist from fleshless bones; And every cave was murmuring: ‘O River, cease to flow and sing, And bear the tall bride on thy banks to the footstool of thy king!’ 16 Then writhed the roots of forest trees In tortuous fear, till tremblingly Green leaves quaked round her. A sharp cry Went upward from the Oreades; Low murmurs woke in bower and cave, With diapason in the wave: The River eddied darkly round, obeying as a slave. 17 Half stooping downward, while she held A flower in loosening fingers light; The quick pink fading from the white Upon her cheek; with eyes that welled Dark pansy thoughts from veins that dart Like restless snakes round the honied heart, And balmy breath that mildly blew her rosered lips apart,— 18 She listen'd—stately, yet dismay'd; And dimly conscious of some change That made the whispering place seem strange And awful, far from human aid; And as the moaning Stream grew near, And whirl'd unto her with eddies clear, She saw my shadow in his waves and shrank away in fear. 19 ‘Small River, flowing with summer sound, Strong River, solemn Ades' slave, Flow unto her with gentle wave, And make an isle, and hem her round.’ The River, sad with gentle worth, Felt backward to that cave of earth Where, troubled with my crimson eyes, he shudder'd into birth. 20 Him saw she trembling; but unseen, Under long sedges lily-strew'd, Round creeping roots of underwood, Low down beneath the grasses green Whereon she waited wondering-eyed, My servant slid with stealthy tide:— Then like a fountain bubbled up and foam'd on either side. 21 And shrinking back she gazed in fear On his wild hair, and lo, an isle— Around whose brim waves rose the while She cried, ‘O mother Ceres, hear!’ Then sprang she wildly to and fro, Wilder than rain and white as snow. ‘O honour'd River, grasp thy prize, and to the footstool flow!’ 22 One swift sunbeam with sickly flare On white arms waving high did gleam, What time she shriek'd, and the strong Stream Leapt up and grasp'd her by the hair. And all was dark. With wild heads bow'd The forest murmur'd, and black cloud Split speumy on the mountain tops with fire and portent loud! 23 Then all was still as the Abyss, Save for the dark and bubbling water, And the far voice. ‘Bear Ceres’ daughter Unto the kingly feet of Dis!’ Wherefore I rose upon my throne, And smote my kingdom's roof of stone; Earth moan'd to her deep fiery roots—Hell answer'd with a groan. 24 When swiftly waving sulphurous wings The Darkness brooded down in fear To listen. I, afar, could hear The coming River's murmurings; My god-like eyes with flash of flame Peer'd up the chasm. As if in shame Of his slave-deed, darkly and slow, my trembling servant came. 25 The gentleness of summer light, This stream, my honour'd slave possessed: The blue flowers mirror'd in his breast, And the meek lamps that sweeten night, Had made his heart too mild to bear With other than a gentle care, And slow sad solemn pace, a load so violet-eyed and fair! 26 Him saw I, as, thro' looming rocks, He glimmer'd like a serpent gray Whose moist coils hiss; then, far away, Lo, the dim gleam of golden locks, Lo, a far gleam of glinting gold, Floating in many a throbbing fold, What time soft ripples panted dark on queenly eyelids cold. 27 Silently, with obeisance meet, In gentle arms escorting well The partner of eternal Hell, Thus flow'd, not halting, to my feet The gracious River with his load: Her with dark arm-sweep he bestow'd On my great footstool—then again, with sharp shriek, upward flow'd. 28 So fair, so fair, so strangely fair, Dark from the waters lay my love; And lo, I, Ades, stoop'd above, And shuddering touch'd the yellow hair That made my beaded eyeballs close— Awful as sunshine. Cold as snows, Pale-faced, dank-lidded, proud, she lay in wonderful repose. 29 And all the lesser Thrones that rise Around me, shook. With murmurous breath, Their Kings shook off eternal death. And with a million fiery eyes Glared red above, below, around, And saw me stooping fiery-crown'd; And the white faces of the damn'd arose without a sound. 30 As if an awful sunbeam, rife With living glory, pierced the gloom, Bringing to spirits blind with doom The summers of forgotten life,— Those pallid faces, mad and stern, Rose up in foam, and each in turn Roll'd downward, as a white wave breaks, and seem'd to plead and yearn. 31 What time this horror loom'd beyond, Her soul was troubled into sighs: Stooping, throned, crown'd, I touch'd her eyes With dim and ceremonial wand; And looking up, she saw and knew An awful love which did subdue Itself to her bright comeliness and gave her greeting due! 32 ‘Welcome!’—The rocks and chasms and caves, The million thrones and their black kings, The very snakes and creeping things, The very damn'd within the waves, Groan'd ‘welcome;’ and she heard—with light Fingers that writhed in tresses bright,— But when I touch'd her to the soul, she slowly rose her height. 33 While shadows of a reign eterne Quench'd the fine glint in her yellow hair, She rose erect more hugely fair, And, dark'ning to a queenhood stern, She gazed into mine eyes and thence Drew black and subtle inference, Subliming the black godhead there with sunnier, sweeter sense. 34 Low at her feet, huge Cerberus Crouch'd groaning, but with royal look She stooping silenced him, and took The throne sublime and perilous That rose to hold her and upstream'd Vaporous fire: the dark void scream'd, The pale Eumenides made moan, with eyes and teeth that gleam'd. 35 Behold, she sits beside me now, A weighty sorrow in her mien, Yet gracious to her woes-a queen; The sunny locks about her brow Shadow'd to godhead solemn, meet; Throned, queen'd; but round about her feet, Sweeten'd by gentle grass and flowers, the brackish waves grow sweet. 36 And surely, when the mirror dun Beneath me mirrors yellowing leaves, And reapers binding golden sheaves, And vineyards purple in the sun, When fulness fills the plenteous year Of the bright upper-world, I hear The voice among the harvest-fields that mourns a daughter dear. 37 ‘Lo, Ceres mourns the bride of Dis,’ The old Earth moans; and rocks and hills, ‘Persephoné;’ sad radiance fills The dripping horn of Artemis Silverly shaken in the sky; And a great frost-wind rushing by— ‘Ceres will rob the eyes of Hell when seedtime draweth nigh.’ 38 And in the seed-time after snow, Down the long caves, in soft distress, Dry corn-blades tangled in her dress, The weary goddess wanders slow— The million eyes of Hell are bent On my strange queen in wonderment,— The ghost of Iris gleams across my waters impotent! 39 And the sweet Bow bends mild and bland O'er rainy meadows near the light, When fading far along the night They wander upward hand-in-hand; And like a phantom I remain, Chain'd to a throne in lonely reign, Till, sweet with greenness, moonlight-kiss'd, she wanders back again 40 But when afar thro' rifts of gold And caverns steep'd in fog complete, I hear the beat of her soft feet, My kingdom totters as of old; And, conscious of her sweeter worth, Her godhead of serener birth, Hell, breathing fire thro' flowers and leaves, feels to the upper-earth. III. PAN. It is not well, ye gods, it is not well! Yea, hear me grumble—rouse, ye sleepers, rouse Upon thick-carpeted Olumpos' top— Nor, faintly hearing, murmur in your sloth ‘'Tis but the voice of Pan the malcontent!’ Shake the sleek sunshine from ambrosial locks, Vouchsafe a sleepy glance at the far earth That underneath ye wrinkles dim with cloud, And smile, and sleep again! Me, when at first The deep Vast murmur'd, and Eternity Gave forth a hollow sound while from its voids Ye blossom'd thick as flowers, and by the light Beheld yourselves eternal and divine,— Me, underneath the darkness visible And calm as ocean when the cold Moon smoothes The palpitating waves without a sound,— Me, ye saw sleeping in a dream, white-hair'd, Low-lidded, gentle, aged, and like the shade Of the eternal self-unconsciousness Out of whose law Ye had awaken'd—gods Fair-statured, self-apparent, marvellous, Dove-eyed, and inconceivably divine. Over the ledges of high mountains, thro' The fulgent streams of dawn, soft-pillowëd On downy clouds that swam in reddening streaks Like milk wherein a crimson wine-drop melts, And far beyond the dark of vague low lands, Uprose Apollo, shaking from his locks Ambrosial dews, and making as he rose A murmur such as west winds weave in June. Wherefore the darkness in whose depth I sat Wonder'd: thro' newly-woven boughs, the light Crept onward to mine eyelids unaware, And fluttering o'er my wrinkled length of limb Like tremulous butterflies above a snake, Disturb'd me,—and I stirr'd, and open'd eyes, Then lifted up my eyes to see the light, And saw the light, and, seeing not myself, Smiled! Thereupon, ye gods, the woods and lawns Grew populously glad with living things. A rod of stone beneath my heel grew bright, Writhing to life, and hissing drew swift coils O'er the upspringing grass; above my head A birch unbound her silver-shimmering hair, Brightening to the notes of numerous birds; And far dim mountains hollow'd out themselves To give forth streams, till down the mountain-sides The loosen'd streams ran flowing. Then a voice Came from the darkness as it roll'd away Under Apollo's sunshine-sandall'd foot, And the vague voice shriek'd ‘Pan!’ and woods and streams, Sky-kissing mountains and the courteous vales, Cried ‘Pan!’ and earth's reverberating roots Gave forth an answer, ‘Pan!’ and stooping down His fiery eyes to scorch me from my trance, Unto the ravishment of his soft lyre ‘Pan!’ sang Apollo: when the wide world heard, Brightening brightlier, till thro' murmurous leaves Pale wood-nymphs peep'd around me whispering ‘Pan!’ And sweeter faces floated in the stream That gurgled to my ankle, whispering ‘Pan!’ And, clinging to the azure gown of air That floated earthward dropping scented dews, A hundred lesser spirits panted ‘Pan!’ And, far along an opening forest-glade, Beating a green lawn with alternate feet, ‘Pan!’ cried the satyrs leaping. Then all sounds Were hush'd for coming of a sweeter sound; And rising up, with outstretch'd arms, I, Pan, Look'd eastward, saw, and knew myself a god. It was not well, ye gods, it was not well! Star-guiders, cloud-compellers—ye who stretch Ambrosia-dripping limbs, great-statured, bright, Silken and fair-proportion'd, in a place Thick-carpeted with grass as soft as sleep; Who with mild glorious eyes of liquid depth Subdue to perfect peace and calm eterne The mists and vapours of the nether-world, That curl up dimly from the nether-world And make a roseate mist wherein ye lie Soft-lidded, broad-foreheaded, stretch'd supine In awful contemplations—ye great gods, Who meditate your forms and find them fair— Ye heirs of odorous rest—it was not well!— For, with Apollo sheer above, I, Pan, In whom a gracious godhead lived and moved, Rose, glorious-hearted, and look'd down; and lo, Goat-legs, goat-thighs, goat-feet, uncouth and rude, And, higher, the breast and bowels of a beast, Huge thews and twisted sinews swoll'n like cords, And thick integument of bark-brown skin— A hideous apparition masculine! But in my veins a new and natural youth, In my great veins a music as of boughs When the cool aspen-fingers of the Rain Feel for the eyelids of the earth in spring, In every vein quick life; within my soul The meekness of some sweet eternity Forgot; and in mine eyes soft violet-thoughts That widen'd in the eyeball to the light, And peep'd, and trembled chilly back to the soul Like leaves of violets closing. By my lawns, My honey-flowing rivers, by my woods Grape-growing, by my mountains down whose sides The slow flocks thread like silver streams at eve, By the deep comfort in the eyes of Zeus When the soft murmur of my peaceful dales Blows like a gust of perfume on his cheek, There where he reigns, cloud-shrouded—by meek lives That smoothe themselves like wings of doves and brood Over immortal themes for love of me— I swear it was not well. Ay, ay, ye smile;— Ye hear me, garrulous, and turn again To contemplation of the slothful clouds That curtain ye for swectness. Hear me, gods! Not the ineffable stars that interlace The azure panoply of Zeus himself, Have surer sweetness than my hyacinths When they grow blue in gazing on blue heaven, Than the white lilies of my rivers when In leafy spring Selené's silver horn Spills paleness, peace, and fragrance.—And for these, For all the sensible or senseless things Which swell the sounds and sights of earth and air, I snatch some glory which of right belongs To ye whom I revile: ay, and for these, For all the sensible or senseless things Which swell the sounds and sights of earth and air, I will snatch fresher glory, fresher joy, Robbing your rights in heaven day by day, Till from my dispensation ye remove Darkness, and drought that parches thirsty skins, The stinging alchemy of frost, the agues That rack me in the season of wet winds— Till, bit by bit, my bestial nether-man Peels off like bark, my green old age shoots up Godhead apparent, and I know myself Fair—as becomes a god! Ay, I shall do! Not I alone am something garrulous, gods! But the broad-bosom'd earth, whose countless young Moan ‘Pan!’ most piteously when ye frown In tempests, or when Thunder, waving wings, Groans crouching from your lightning spears, and then Springs at your lofty silence with a shriek! Not I alone, low horror masculine, But earthquake-shaken hills, the dewy dales, Blue rivers as they flow, and boughs of trees, Yea, monsters, and the purblind race of men, Grow garrulous of your higher glory, gods; Yearning unto it moan my name aloud, Climbing unto it shriek or whisper ‘Pan!’ Till from the far-off verdurous depths, from deep Impenetrable woods whose wondrous roots Blacken to coal or redden into gold, I, stirring in this ancient dream of mine, Make answer—and they hear. In Arcady I, sick of mine own envy, hollow'd out A valley, green and deep; then pouring forth From the great hollow of my hand a stream Sweeter than honey, bade it wander on In soft and rippling lapse to the far sea. Upon its banks grew flowers as thick as grass, Gum-dropping poplars and the purple vine, Slim willows dusty like the thighs of bees, And, further, stalks of corn and wheat and flax, And, even further, on the mountain sides White sheep and new-yean'd lambs, and in the midst Mild-featured shepherds piping. Was not this An image of your grander ease, O gods? A faint sweet picture of your bliss, O gods? They thank'd me, those sweet shepherds, with the smoke Of crimson sacrifice of lambkins slain, Rich spices, succulent herbs that savour meats; And when they came upon me ere aware, Walk'd sudden on my presence where I piped By rivers lorn my mournful ditties old, Cried ‘Pan!’ and worshipp'd. Yet it was not well, Ye gods, it was not well, that I, who gave The harvest to these men, and with my breath Thicken'd the wool upon the backs of sheep, I, Pan, should in these purblind mortal forms Witness a loveliness more gently fair, Nearer to your dim loveliness, O gods! Than my immortal wood pervading self,— Carelessly blown on by the rosy Hours, Who breathe quick breath and smile before they die— Goat-footed, horn'd, a monster—yet a god. By wanton Aphrodité's velvet limbs, I swear, ye amorous gods, it was not well!— Down the long vale of Arcady I chased A wood-nymph, unapparell'd and white-limb'd, From gleaming shoulder unto foot a curve Delicious, like the bow of Artemis: A gleam of dewy moonlight on her limbs; Within her veins a motion as of waves Moon-led and silver-crested to the moon; And in her heart a sweetness such as fills Uplooking maidens when the virgin orb Witches warm bosoms into snows, and gives The colourable chastity of flowers To the tumultuous senses curl'd within. Her, after summer noon, what time her foot Startled with moonlight motion milk-blue stalks Of hyacinths in a dim forest glade,— Her saw I, and, uplifting eager arms, I rush'd around her as a rush of boughs, My touch thrill'd thro' her, she beheld my face, And like a gnat it stung her, and she fled. Down the green glade, along the verdurous shade, She screaming fled and I pursued behind: By Zeus, it was as though the forest moved Behind her, following; and with shooting boughs, And bristling arms and stems, and murmurous leaves, It eddied after her—my underwood Of bramble and the yellow-blossom'd furze Flung its thick growth around her waist, my trees Dropt thorns before her, and my growing grass Put forth its green and sappy oils and slid Under her feet; until, with streaming hair Like ravell'd sunshine torn 'mid scars and cliffs, Pale, breathless, and long-throated like a swan, With tongue that panted 'tween the foamy lips As the red arrow in a tulip's cup, She, coming swiftly on the river-side, Into the circle of a sedgy pool Plunged knee-deep, shrieking. Then I, thrusting arms To grasp her, touch'd her with hot hands that clung Like burrs to the soft skin; while, writhing down Even as a fountain lessens gurglingly, She cried to Artemis, ‘Artemis, Artemis, Sweet goddess, Artemis, aid me, Artemis!’ And o'er the laurels on the river-side, Dark and low-fluttering, Daphne's hidden soul Breathed fearful hoar-frost, echoing ‘Artemis’; When lo, above the sandy sunset rose The silver sickle of the green-gown'd witch Which flicker'd thrice into a pallid orb, And thrice flash'd white across the forest leaves, And—lo, the change ye wot of: melting limbs Black'ning to oozy sap of reeds, white hands Waving aloft and putting forth green shoots, The faint breath-bubbles circling in a pool, Last. the sharp voice's murmur dying away In the low lapping of the rippling pool, The melancholy motion of the pool, And the faint undertone of whispering reeds. By Latmos and its shepherd, was it well? By smooth-chinn'd Syrinx, was it well, O gods? Yet mark. What time the pallid sickle wax'd Blue-edged and luminous o'er the black'ning west, I, looming hideous in the smooth pool, stooped And pluck'd seven wondrous pipes of brittle reeds Wherein the wood-nymph's soul still flutter'd faint; And these seven pipes I shaped to one, wherein I, Pan, with ancient and dejected head Nodding above its image in the pool, And large limbs stretch'd their length on shadowy banks, Did breathe such weird and awful ravishment, Such symmetry of sadness and sweet sound, Such murmurs of deep boughs and hollow cells, That neither bright Apollo's hair-strung lute, Nor Heré's queenly tongue when her red lips Flutter to intercession of love-thoughts Throned in the counsel-keeping eyes of Zeus, Nor airs from heaven, blow sweetlier. Hear me, gods! Behind her veil of azure, Artemis Turn'd pale and listen'd; mountains, woods, and streams, And every mute and living thing therein, Marvell'd, and hush'd themselves to hear the end— Yea, far away, the fringe of the green sea Caught the faint sound and with a deeper moan Rounded the pebbles on the shadowy shore. Whence, in the season of the pensive eve, The earth plumes down her weary, weary wings; The Hours, each frozen in his mazy dance, Look scared upon the stars and seem to stand Stone-still, like chisell'd angels mocking Time; And woods and streams and mountains, beasts and birds, And serious hearts of purblind men, are hush'd; While music sweeter far than any dream Floats from the far-off silence, where I sit Wondrously wov'n about with forest boughs— Through which the moon peeps faintly, on whose leaves The unseen stars sprinkle a diamond dew— And shadow'd in some water that not flows, But, pausing, spreads dark waves as smooth as oil To listen! Am I over-garrulous, gods? Thou pale-faced witch, green-kirtled,—thou whose light Troubles the beardless shepherd where he sleeps On Latmos,—am I over-garrulous? Nay, then, pale huntress of my groves, I swear The lily and the primrose 'neath thy heel Savour as fair as thee, as pure as thee, Drinking the lucid glamour of thy speed; And on the cheeks of marriageable maids Dwelleth a pallor enviably sweet, Sweet as thy sweetest self, yet robb'd from thee. Snow-bosom'd lady, art thou proud?—Then hark . . . When last in the cool quiet of the night Thou glimmeredst dimly down with thy white nymphs And brush'd these dewy lawns with buskin'd foot, I, Pan the scorn'd, into an oak-tree crept, And holding between thumb and finger—thus— A tiny acorn, dropt it cunningly In the small nest beneath thy snow-heap'd breasts, And thou didst pause in tumult, cried aloud, Then redden'd like a rose from breast to brow, Sharp-crimson like a rose from breast to brow, And trembled, aspen-hearted, timorous As new-yean'd lambs, and with a young doe's cry Startled amazed from thine own tremulous shade Faint-mirror'd in the dark and dewy lawn! Ha, turn your mild grand eyes, O gods, and hear! Why do I murmur darkly, do ye ask? What do I seek for, yearn for?—Why, not much. I would be milky-limb'd and straight and tall And pleasant-featured, like Apollo there! I would be lithe and fair as Hermes is; And, with that glittering sheath of god-like form, Trust me, could find for it a wit as keen As that which long ago did prick and pain The thin skin of the Sun-God. I would be Grand and fine-statured as becomes a god, A sight divine conceived harmoniously, A stately incarnation of my sweet Pipings in lonely places. There's the worm! Ay, ay, the mood is on me—I am aged, White-bearded, and my very lifted hands Shake garrulously—and ye hear, and smile. By the faint undertone of this blind Earth, Swooning towards the pathway of the Sun With flowery pulses, leafy veins, whene'er She hears in intercession of new births My voice miraculous melancholy old,— I swear not I alone, a sensible god, Shall keep these misproportions, worse than beast's; While woods and streams, and all that dwell therein, And merest flowers, and the starr'd coils of snakes, Yea, purblind mortal men, inhale from heaven Such dews as give them heavenly seemliness, Communicably lovely as the shapes That doze on high Olumpos. Is it well? Ye who compel the very clouds to forms Beauteous and purely beauteous, ere my rain Rends their white ves ments into flowers to make My peaceful vales look lovely,—gods, great gods, I ask ye, is it well?—Ye answer not. But Earth has answer'd, and all things that grow, All things that live, all things that feel or see The interchanges of the sun and moon; And with a yearning palpable and dumb, Yet conscious of some glory yet unborn, Of unfulfillëd mysteries, I, Pan, Prophesy. In the time to come,—in years Across whose vast I wearily impel These ancient, blear'd, and humble-lidded eyes,— Some law more strong than I, yet part of me, Some power more piteous, yet a part of me, Shall hurl ye from Olumpos to the depths, And bruise ye back to that great darkness whence Ye blossom'd thick as flowers; while I—I, Pan— The ancient haunting shadow of dim earths, Shall slough this form of beast, this wrinkled length, Yea, cast it from my feet as one who shakes A worthless garment off; and lo, beneath, Mild-featured manhood, manhood eminent, Subdued into the glory of a god, Sheer harmony of body and of soul, Wondrous, and inconceivably divine. Wherefore, ye gods, with this my prophecy I sadden those sweet sounds I pipe unseen. From dimly lonely places float the sounds To haunt the regions of the homeless air, Whatever changeful season ye vouchsafe To all broad worlds which, hearing, whisper, ‘Pan!’ And thence they reach the hearts of lonely men, Who wearily bear the burthen and are pain'd To utterance of fond prophetic song, Who singing smile, because the song is sweet, Who die, because they cannot sing the end. It is my care to keep the graves of such Thick-strewn and deep with grass and precious flowers Such as ye slumber on; and to those graves, In sable vestments, ever comes the ghost Of my forgot and dumb eternity, Mnemosyne; but what she broods on there I know not, nor can any wholly know, Mortal or god. The seasons come and go, In their due season perish rocks and trees, In their due season are the streams drain'd dry; Earth dumbly changes, and those lonely men, Less blind than purblind mortals, sing and die; But still, with hooded and dejected head, Above those graves ponders Mnemosyne; While I remain to pipe my ditties old, And my new prophecy, in ancient woods And by the margins of unfortunate pools,— My wondrous music dying afar away Upon the fringes of the setting sun. IV. THE NAIAD. 1 Dian white-arm'd has given me this cool shrine, Deep in the bosom of a wood of pine: The silver-sparkling showers That close me in, the flowers That prink my fountain's brim, are hers and mine; And when the days are mild and fair, And grass is springing, buds are blowing, Sweet it is, 'mid waters flowing, Here to sit, and know no care, 'Mid the waters flowing, flowing, flowing, Combing my yellow, yellow hair. 2 The ounce and panther down the mountainside Creep thro' dark greenness in the eventide; And at the fountain's brink Casting great shades they drink, Gazing upon me, tame and sapphire-eyed; For, awed by my pale face, whose light Gleameth thro' sedge and lilies yellow, They, lapping at my fountain mellow, Harm not the lamb that in affright Throws in the pool so mellow, mellow, mellow, Its shadow small and dusky-white. 3 Oft do the fauns and satyrs, flusht with play, Come to my coolness in the hot noon-day. Nay, once indeed, I vow By Dian's truthful brow, The great god Pan himself did pass this way, And, all in festal oak-leaves clad, His limbs among these lilies throwing, Watch'd the silver waters flowing, Listen'd to their music glad, Saw and heard them flowing, flowing, flowing, And ah! his face was worn and sad! 4 Mild joys around like silvery waters fall; But it is sweetest, sweetest far of all, In the calm summer night, When the tree-tops look white, To be exhaled in dew at Dian's call, Among my sister-clouds to move Over the darkness earth bedimming, Milky-robed thro' heaven swimming, Floating round the stars above, Swimming proudly, swimming, proudly swimming, And waiting on the Moon I love. 5 So tenderly I keep this cool green shrine, Deep in the bosom of a wood of pine; Faithful thro' shade and sun, That service due and done May haply earn for me a place divine Among the white-robed deities That thread thro' starry paths, attending My sweet Lady, calmly wending Thro' the silence of the skies, Changing in hues of beauty never end ing, Drinking the light of Dian's eyes. V. THE SATYR. 1. The trunk of this tree, Dusky-leaved, shaggy-rooted, Is a pillow well suited To a hybrid like me, Goat-bearded, goat-footed; For the boughs of the glade Meet above me, and throw A cool pleasant shade On the greenness below; Dusky and brown'd Close the leaves all around; And yet, all the while, Thro' the boughs I can see A star, with a smile, Looking at me. 2. Full length I lie, On this mossy tree-knot, With face to the sky, The vast blue I see not; And I start in surprise From my dim half-dream, With the moist white gleam Of the star in mine eyes: So strange does it seem That the star should beam From her crystal throne On this forest nook Of all others, and look Upon me alone: Ay, that yonder divine Soft face Should shine On this one place; And, when things so fair Till the earth and air, Should choose to be, Night after night, The especial light Of a monster like me! 3. Why, all day long, I run about With a madcap throng, And laugh and shout. Silenus grips My ears, and strides On my shaggy hips, And up and down In an ivy crown Tipsily rides; And when in a doze His eyelids close, Off he tumbles, and I Can his wine-skin steal, I drink—and feel The grass roll—sea-high! Then with shouts and yells, Down mossy dells, I stagger after The wood-nymphs fleet, Who with mocking laughter And smiles retreat; And just as I clasp A yielding waist, With a cry embraced, —Gush! it melts from my grasp Into water cool, And—bubble! trouble! Seeing double! I stumble and gasp In some icy pool! 4. All suborn me, Flout me, scorn me! Drunken joys And cares are mine, Romp and noise, And the dregs of wine; And whene'er in the night Diana glides by The spot where I lie, With her maids green-dight, I must turn my back In a rude affright, And blindly fly From her shining track! Or if only I hear Her bright foot-fall near, Fall with face to the grass, Not breathing for fear Till I feel her pass. 5. I am— I know not what: Neither what I am, Nor what I am not— I seem to have rollick'd, And frolick'd, In this wood for ay, With a beast's delight Romping all day, Dreaming all night! Yet I seem To remember awaking Just here, and aching With the last forsaking Tender gleam Of a droll strange dream.— When I lay at mine ease, With a sense at my heart Of being a part Of the grass and trees And the scented earth, And of drinking the bright Subdued sunlight With a leafy mirth: Then behold, I could see A wood-nymph peeping Out of her tree, And closer creeping, Timorously Looking at me! And still, so still, I lay until She trembled close to me, Soft as a rose to me, And I leapt with a thrill And a shout, and threw Arms around her, and press'd her, Kiss'd her, caress'd her,— Ere she scream'd, and flew. 6. Then I was 'ware Of a power I had— To drink the air, Laugh and shout, Run about, And be consciously glad— So I follow'd the maiden 'Neath shady eaves, Thro' groves deep-laden With fruit and leaves, Till, drawing near To a brooklet clear, I shuddering fled From the monstrous shape There mirrorëd— Which seem'd to espy me, And grin and gape, And leap up high In the air with a cry, And fly me! 7. Whence I seem to have slowly Grown conscious of being A thing wild, unholy, And foul to the seeing.— But ere I knew aught Of others like me, I would lie, fancy-fraught, In the greenness of thought, Beneath a green tree; And seem to be deep In the scented earth-shade 'Neath the grass of the glade, In a strange half-sleep: When the wind seem'd to move me, The cool rain to kiss, The sunlight to love me, The stars in their bliss To tingle above me; And I crept thro' deep bowers That were sparkling with showers And sprouting for pleasure, And I quicken'd the flowers To a joy without measure— Till my sense seem'd consuming With warmth, and, upspringing, I saw the flowers blooming, And heard the birds singing! 8. Wherever I range, Thro' the greenery, That vision strange, Whatsoever it be, Is a part of me Which suffers not change.— The changes of earth, Water, air, ever-stirring, Disturb me, conferring My sadness or mirth: Wheresoever I run, I drink strength from the sun; The wind stirs my veins With the leaves of the wood, The dews and the rains Mingle into my blood. I stop short In my sport, Panting, and cower, While the blue skies darken With a sunny shower; And I lie and hearken, In a balmy pain To the tinkling clatter, Pitter, patter, Of the rain On the leaves close to me, And sweet thrills pass Thro' and thro' me, Till I thingle like grass. When lightning with noise Tears the wood's green ceiling, When the black sky's voice Is terribly pealing, I hide me, hide me, hide me, With wild averted face, In some terror-stricken place, While flowers and trees beside me, And every streamlet near, Darken whirl, and wonder, Above, around, and under, And murmur back the thunder In a palpitating fear! 9. Ay; and when the earth turns A soft bosom of balm To the darkness that yearns Above it, and grows To dark, dewy, and calm Repose,— I, apart from rude riot, Partake of the quiet The night is bequeathing, Lie, unseen and unheard, In the greenness just stirr'd By its own soft breathing— And my heart then thrills With a strange sensation Like the purl of rills Down moonlit hills That loom afar, With a sweet sensation Like the palpitation Of yonder star! 10. Thro' yonder bough Her white ray twinkles; And on my brow She silently sprinkles A dewy rain, That lulls my brain To a dream of being Under the ground, Blind to seeing Deaf to sound, Drinking a dew That drops from afar, And feeling unto The sweet pulse of a star, Who is beckoning me Though I cannot see! And of suddenly blooming Up into the air, And, swooning, assuming The shape I wear! While all fair things Fly night and day from me, Wave bright wings, And glimmer away from me! 11. —She shines above me, And heareth not, Though she smiles on this spot And seems to love me. Here I lie aloof, Goat-footed, knock-kneed, A monster, indeed, From horns to hoof; And the star burns clearly With pearl-white gleam— Have I merely Dream'd a dream? 12. —Did she hear me, I wonder?— She trembles upon Her throne—and is gone! The boughs darken under, Then thrill, and are stirr'd By the notes of a bird, The green grass brightens With pearly dew, And the whole wood whitens As the dawn creeps thro'.— ‘Hoho!’—that shout Flung the echoes about The boughs, like balls! Who calls?— 'Tis the noisy rout Of my fellows upspringing From sleep and dreaming, To the birds' shrill singing, The day's soft beaming: And they madly go To and fro, Though o' nights they are dumb. Hoho! hoho! I come! I come! Hark!—to the cry They reply: ‘Ha, there, ha!’ ‘Hurrah!’—‘hurrah!’ And startling afraid At the cries, In the depths of the glade Echo replies— ‘Ho, there!’—‘ho, there!’— By the stream below there The answer dies. VI. VENUS ON THE SUN-CAR. 1 Tell me, thou many-finger'd Frost, Coming and going like a ghost In leafless woods forsaken— O Frost that o'er him lying low Drawest the garment of the snow From silver cloud-wings shaken, And round bare boughs with strange device Twinest fantastic leaves of ice— When will Adon waken? Lo, dawn by dawn I rise afar Beside Apollo in his car, And, far below us wreathing, Thy fogs and mists are duskly curl'd Round the white slumber of the world, Like to its own deep breathing; But crimson thro' the mist our light. Foameth and freezeth, till by night Snow-bosom'd hills we fade on— The pallid god, at my desire, Gives unto thee a breath of fire To reach the lips of Adon. 2 Tell me, thou bare and wintry World, Wherein the wingëd flowers are curl'd Like pigmy spirits dozing— O World, within whose lap he lies, With thy quick earth upon his eyes, In dim unseen reposing, Husht underneath the wind and storm, Still rosy-lipt in darkness warm— Are Adon's eyes unclosing? Lo, dawn by dawn I rise afar Beside Apollo in his car, Thro' voids of azure soaring, And gazing down on regions dead, With golden hair dishevellëd, And claspëd hands imploring. Wonderful creatures of the light Hover above thee, hanging bright Faint pictures glen and glade on: The pallid god, at my desire, Hideth in glimmering snows his fire, To reach the sleep of Adon. 3 Tell me, thou spirit of the Sun, Radiant-lock'd and awful one, Strong, constant, unforsaking— Sun, by whose shadier side I sit And search thy face, and question it, Conferring light and taking— Whose fiery westward motion throws The shadow-hours on his repose,— Is my Adon waking? Lo, dawn by dawn I rise afar Beside thee in thy flaming car, Thou ever-constant comer! And flashing on the clouds that break Around our path thy sunbeams make A phantom of the summer. O breathe upon the Moon, that she May use her magic witchery When snowy hills we fade on, That, in the dark, when thou art gone, She speed the resurrection, And stir the sleep of Adon! 4 Tell me, O silver-wingëd Moon, That glidest to melodious tune Ice-sparkling skies on skies up,— O Moon, that to the sunset gray, Drinking faint light that fades away, Liftest immortal eyes up, And walking on, art thro' the night Troubled to pain by that strange light,— When will Adon rise up? Lo, dawn by dawn I rise afar Beside Apollo in his car, Imploring sign or token But night by night such pale peace beams Upon his slumber, that it seems Too beauteous to be broken! O gentle goddess, be not cold— But, some dim dawn, may we behold New glory hill and glade on, The leaves and flowers alive to bliss, And, somewhat pale with thy last kiss, The smiling face of Adon! VII. SELENE THE MOON. 1 I hide myself in the cloud that flies From the west and drops on the hill's gray shoulder, And I gleam through the cloud with my panther-eyes, While the stars turn paler, the dews grow colder; I veil my naked glory in mist, Quivering down ward and dewily glistening, Till his sleep is as pale as my lips unkist, And I tremble above him, panting and listening. As white as a star, as cold as a stone, Dim as my light in a sleeping lake, With his head on his arm he lieth alone. And I sigh ‘Awake! Wake, Endymion, wake and see!’ And he stirs in his sleep for the love of me; But on his eyelids my breath I shake: ‘Endymion, Endymion! Awaken, awaken!’ And the yellow grass stirs with the mystic moan, And the tall pines groan, And Echo sighs in her grot forsaken The name of Endymion! 2 A foamy dew from the Ocean old, Whence I rise with shadows behind me flying, Drops from my sandals and glittereth cold On the long spear-grass where my love is lying; My face is dim with departed suns, And my eyes are dark from the depths of ocean, A starry shudder throughout me runs, And my pale cloud stirs with a radiant motion, When the darkness wherein he slumbers alone Ebbs back from my brightness, as black waves break From my shining ankle with shuddering tone; And I sigh ‘Awake! Wake, Endymion, wake and hear!’ And he stirs in his sleep with a dreamy fear, And his thin lips part for my sweet sake: ‘Endymion, Endymion! Awaken, awaken!’ And the skies are moved, and a shadow is blown From the Thunderer's throne, And the spell of a voice from Olumpos shaken Echoes ‘Endymion!’ 3 Then under his lids like a balmy rain I put pale dreams of my heavenly glory;— And he sees me lead with a silver chain The tamed Sea-Tempest white-tooth'd and hoary; And he sees me fading thro' forests dark Where the leopard and lion avoid me in wonder, Or ploughing the sky in a pearly bark, While the earth is dumb with my beauty under! Then he brightens and yearns where he lies alone, And his heart grows dumb with a yearning ache, And the thin lips part with a wondering moan, As I sigh ‘Awake! Wake, Endymion, wake and see All things grow bright for the love of me, With a love that grows gentle for thy sweet sake! Endymion, Endymion! Awaken, awaken!’ And my glory grows paler, the deep woods groan, And the waves intone, Ay, all things whereon my glory is shaken Murmur ‘Endymion!’ 4 Aï! The black earth brightens, the Sea creeps near When I swim from the sunset's shadowy portal; But he will not see, and he will not hear, Though to hear and see were to be immortal: Pale as a star and cold as a stone, Dim as my ghost in a sleeping lake, In an icy vision he lieth alone, And I sigh ‘Awake! Wake, Endymion, wake and be Divine, divine, for the love of me!’ And my odorous breath on his lids I shake: ‘Endymion, Endymion! Awaken, awaken!’ But Zeus sitteth cold on his cloud-shrouded throne And heareth my moan, And his stern lips form not the hope-forsaken Name of Endymion. VIII. IRIS THE RAINBOW. 1 'Mid the cloud enshrouded haze Of Olumpos I arise, With the full and rainy gaze Of Apollo in mine eyes; But I shade my dazzled glance With my dripping pinions white Where the sunlight sparkles dance In a many-tinctured light: My foot upon the woof Of a fleecy cloudlet small, I glimmer thro' the roof Of the paven banquet-hall, And a soft pink radiance dips Thro' the floating mists divine, Touching eyes and cheeks and lips Of the mild-eyed gods supine, And the growing glory rolls Round their foreheads, while I stain, With a blush like wine, the bowls Of transparcnt porcelain: Till the whole calm place has caught A deep gleam of rosy fire— When I darken to the thought In the eyes of Zeus the Sire. 2 Then Zeus, arising, stoops O'er the ledges of the skies, Looking downward, thro' the loops Of the starry tapestries, On the evident dark plain Speck'd with wood and hill and stream, On the wrinkled tawny main Where the ships, like snowflakes, gleam; And with finger without swerve, Swiftly lifted, swiftly whirl'd, He draws a magic curve O'er the dark low-lying world; When with waving wings display'd, On the Sun-god's threshold bright I upleap, and seem to fade In a flash of golden light; But I plunge thro' vapours dim To the dark low-lying land, And I tremble, float, and swim, On the strange curve of the Hand: From my wings, that drip, drip, drip, With cool rains, shoot jets of fire, As across green capes I slip With the thought of Zeus the Sire. 3 Thence, with drooping wings bedew'd, Folded close about my form, I alight with feet unview'd On the ledges of the storm; For a moment, cloud-enroll'd, Mid the murm'rous rain I stand, And with meteor eyes behold Vapoury ocean, misty land; Till the thought of Zeus outsprings From my ripe mouth with a sigh, And unto my lips it clings Like a shining butterfly; When I brighten, gleam, and glow And my glittering wings unfurl, And the melting colours flow To my foot of dusky pearl; And the ocean mile on mile Gleams thro' capes and straits and bays, And the vales and mountains smile, And the leaves are wet with rays,— While I wave the humid Bow Of my wings with flash of fire, And the Tempest, crouch'd below, Knows the thought of Zeus the Sire. IX. ORPHEUS THE MUSICIAN. I sat of old beside a stream new-born From loamy loins of mountains cold, And it was garrulous of dreams forlorn And visions old: Wherefore the legends of the woods and caves With that faint melody were blended; And as the stream slid down to ocean-waves, I comprehended. Into a dreary silence dim and deep I sank with drowsy sighs and nods: Then sang—my blue eyes dark and wise from sleep— The birth of gods.— A gleaming shoulder cut the stream, and lo! I saw the glistening Naiad rise: She floated, like a lily white as snow, With half-closed eyes. And suddenly, thronging the boughs around, Came forest faces strange and glad, That droopt moist underlips and drank the sound Divinely sad. Far down the glade, where heavy shadows slept, Stole, purple-stainëd by the vine, Silenus,—thro' whose blood my music crept Like wondrous wine: Tiptoe, like one who fears to break a spell, He came, with eyeballs blank as glass— Not drawing breath till, at my feet, he fell Prone on the grass. Then, leaning forkëd chin upon his hand, He listen'd, dead to tipsy strife, And lo! his face grew smooth and soft and bland With purer life Goat-footed fauns and satyrs one by one, With limbs upon the greensward thrown, Gather'd, and darken'd round me in the sun, Like shapes of stone: Between the sunset and the green hillside Quaint pigmy spirits linger'd bright, Till heaven's one star swam dewy, opening wide To the delight,— While sunlight redden'd, dying, and below All heark'd—like shapes upon a cup, By skiëd Heré, in the ambrosial glow, Held rosily up. Then twilight duskly gloam'd upon the place, Full of sweet odour and cool shade, But music made a lamp of every face In the forest-glade: Till swiftly swam, in showers of pearly beams, Selené to her azure arc, Scattering silence, light, and dewy dreams On eyelids dark. The music sadden'd, and the greenwood stirr'd, The moonlight clothed us in its veil, As stooping down the dove-eyed goddess heard, Smiled, and grew pale: For as they listen'd, satyrs, nymphs, and fauns Conceived their immortality— Yea, the weird spirits of the woods and lawns, Gross, vile, to see— Whence her pure light disturb'd them, and they strove To shake away the sweet strange charm; But the light brighten'd, shaken from above With pearly arm. They could not fly, they could not cry nor speak, It held them like a hand of strength,— They hid their faces, wild, abash'd and weak, And writhed full length. The Naiad lifted up her dewy chin, And knew, and saw the light with love, Made peaceful by a purity akin To hers above. And countless beauteous spirits of the shade Knew their own souls and felt no fear; While Echo, nestling in her thyme-cave, made An answer clear. Till, when I ceased to sing, the satyr-crew Rush'd back to riot and carouse; Self-fearful faces blushingly withdrew Into leafy boughs; Lastly, Silenus to his knees upcrept, Rubb'd eyelids swollen like the vine, Stared blankly round him, vow'd that he had slept, And bawl'd for wine. X. POLYPHEME'S PASSION. Ho, Silenus!—no one here! The kitchen empty, the flocks in stalls, The red fire flickering over the walls, And—a young kid spitted—dainty cheer! Ho, Silenus!—tipsy old reveller, Soft-zone-unloosener, bright-hair-disheveller, Where are you hiding, you tipsy old hound you, With your beard of a goat and your eyes of a lamb? SILENUS. Ho, Cyclops! POLYPHEME. He mocks me! Where are you, confound you? SILENUS. Patience, sweet master, here I am!— POLYPHEME. Rise! or with my great fist I'll put an end to thee; The dregs of my great flagon have been warming thee Thou'rt drunk, sow-ears. I find there's no reforming thee, Tho' six round moons I've tried to be a friend to thee. Once more divinely warming those old veins, Chirping like grasshoppers at every pore, Foaming as warm as milk among thy brains, Gushing like sunshine in thine heart's dry core, Runs the pink nectar of my vines. It stains, Flowing from that bald head, this grassy floor— Too sweet for earth to drink, unmeet for thee, Fit only to be quaffed by gods like me! SILENUS. Cyclops! POLYPHEME. Jump up, then, quickly. Nay, no more. Follow me to this rocky eminence, Cool-cushion'd with the yellow moss, from whence We can at ease behold The cloud-stain'd greenness of the ocean sleek, Rounding its glassy waves into the creek, Speckled with sparkling jewels manifold, And, far away, one melting patch of gold. Now, sit!—Nay, nearer, higher—here, above My shoulder. Turn thy face to mine, Silenus! Fear not:—being fill'd with the sweet milk of Venus, Thou'rt a fit counsellor for one in love; And, as I'm in a talking humour, why— Suppose we chat a little at our leisure. SILENUS. With pleasure! The subject? POLYPHEME. One alone beneath the sky, Old man, is worthy of the conversation And serious consideration Of such a god as I! Now, guess the name of that sweet thing? SILENUS. With ease. Bacchus, the god to whom these aged knees Bend gloriously impotent so often, And in whose luscious pool I dip hot mouth and eyes, and soak and soften The yoke of thy strong rule. POLYPHEME. A thing a thousand times more beautiful! SILENUS. I know no thing more beautiful than he When, dripping odours cool, Deep-purpled, like a honey-bosom'd flower For which the red mouth buzzes like a bee, He bursts from thy deep caverns gushingly, And throws his pleasure round him in a shower, And sparkles, sparkles, like the eyes that see, In sunshine, murmuring for very glee And bursting beaded bubbles until sour Lips tremble into moist anticipation Of his rich exultation! POLYPHEME. Has little Bacchus, whom ye praise so, power To unnerve these mighty limbs, make this one Eye Rain mpotent tears, hurl this gigantic bulk Down on its stubborn knees—nay, make me skulk And fume and fret, and simper oaths, and sigh, Like tiny mortal milking-maids who sulk In dairies, frothing yellow like their cream? Could Bacchus, once let loose to fight and fly, Do all these things to sinewy Polypheme? SILENUS. Assuredly! POLYPHEME. By this right hand, you lie!— I am a god, great-statured, strong, and born Out of Poseidon's nervy loins divine! I laugh the wrath of Zeus himself to scorn; And when I rise erect on Aetna's horn My shadow on the faint sea-hyaline Falls like a cloud wherein the winds drop still And white-wing'd ships move slowly without will. Shall bulk so wondrous and so grand as mine Yield to the miserable god of wine? SILENUS. Certainly not. POLYPHEME. Never!—by Pallas' spear, At whose sharp touch the plump god leaps and flies, While startled Revel shrieks with haggard eyes! Never, by Hermes, whom the drunken fear, But whose quick fingers pilfer not the wise! SILENUS. Whom shall we praise, O Cyclops? POLYPHEME. Thou shalt hear— Tell me, didst thou ever see a,— Ever see a, ever hear a,— Either far away or near, a— Nymph so sweet as Galatea? SILENUS. Never! POLYPHEME. 'Tis false, old man! she is not fair;— Those weeds that under ocean rot at ease Into dark dreams o' the flowery earth, and there Put purples in the sea-nymph's sunny hair Are fairer: she is changeable as these. She is as wanton as the perfumed fays That dimple on the windless sea and dally, Musically, With the puff'd sails of ships becalm'd for days. SILENUS. True, Cyclops, she is fickle; and by her Whose amorous breath blew the Greek host to Troy, I have seen fairer! POLYPHEME. Dotard! Driveller! Not her the false Idalian shepherd-boy, With silken string, like a tame heifer, led— Nay, not lush Aphroditè, whose blue eyne, Pink-lidded, smiled on their unhallow'd bed— Is half so fair, so precious, so divine, As Galatea! SILENUS. Exactly what I said. POLYPHEME. Her voice hath gentle sweetness, borrowëd From soft tide-lispings on the pebbly sand, 'Tis like the brooding doves in junipers; White as a shell of ocean is her hand, Wherein, with rosy light, the pink blood stirs! Her hair excels the fruitage of the beech Wherein the sun runs liquid gleam on gleam; Her breasts are like two foaming bowls of cream, A red straw-berry in the midst of each! And the soft gold-down on her silken chin Is like the under side of a ripe peach— A dimple dipping honeyly therein! SILENUS. Her eyes— POLYPHEME. Profane them not!—For their sweet fire is Wondrous and various as the Bow Drawn over rainy ledges dripping low By many-colour'd Iris— From whose bright end, plunged the dark waters under, Woven with the tapestries of her sea-cave, And dying hue by hue on the green wave, They may have drunk a portion of their wonder. But oh, what tongue can tell Their glory inexpressible? You seem to see the music of the ocean Folded within them, as within a shell, And gently stirring with a violet motion, Until it drops unto the lips, and there Flutters in perfumed accents on the air; Nor this alone. They change as the sea changes, In hues as various as the ringdove's dyes: Whatsoever sweet and strange is Flashes across them with a quick surprise. Now, in their troubled orbs rise multiform Wild pictures of sky-tempest and sea-storm; And her wild eyes droop brightly on her breast Till it is troubled like a thing distrest; But in their softest mood You watch the pale soul tremulously brood On those bright orbs whose fire the dark sea cools, And there it trembles as the moonlight flows On seas just stirr'd by their own deep repose, And throbbing, throbbing, into silver pools! SILENUS. O eloquent Cyclops, pause, and breathe a space!— Few eyes save thine, few eyes of earth, have plainly Seen this immortal Galatea's face; For she thou lovest is of that fair race Whom mortal vision dreams of, but seeks vainly— For they comb and they comb Their yellow locks, Under the foam, Among weedy rocks! And they sing unseen In their sea-caves green, And gaze at the white sun overhead Whose pale ray saddens their dripping curls, Or the moon that glimm'ring in ocean's bed Leaves her light for ever in pools of pearls! POLYPHEME. Chirrup not, wine-sponge!—Am not I a god? Cannot this eye peer to Olumpos' helm? Does not the great sea, trembling at my nod, Hush itself humbly around this my realm? SILENUS. It does, O Cyclops! POLYPHEME. Save, of course, when I Hurl rocks and trees down on the shuddering ships, And, while I loom above the waves, my lips Roar terrible defiance at the sky. SILENUS. Precisely. POLYPHEME. Ask not, then, the when and how; But turn thine ancient gaze On the broad wonder of my brow, Thence drop it, in a natural amaze, Down the steep mountain to my sinewy feet, Round which the lambs, as small as snowflakes, bleat; Now, tell me—am I fair? SILENUS. Most fair! POLYPHEME. Thy fears Lie to my strength a hollow lie, Silenus! SILENUS. By all the love that there exists between us, By doves that perch on Bacchus' vine-wreath'd ears, I swear thou art most beautiful! POLYPHEME. Again: Have those blurr'd eyeballs noticed that of late Mine air has grown more solemn, more sedate, More bountiful to those I hold in chain To watch my flocks, and more compassionate; As if I struggled underneath the weight Of some indefinite pain? That I have learn'd to tremble and to blush, To droop this eyelid modestly, to flush All over at the tiniest whispering sound, To pick small dainty steps upon the ground As if I saw and seeing fear'd to crush Some crawling insect or the crimson-crown'd Small daisy-flower that, whensoe'er I pass, Shuts up its little leaves upon the grass And thinks the shadowy eve has stolen down! SILENUS. Cyclops!—These things I saw, but fear'd to question; Nay, with a blush I own it—do not frown!— I set thy trouble down as indigestion. For neither dainty kids, nor lambs stall-fed, Nor sucking-swine with pippins in their teeth, Nor ox-thighs with green herbs engarlanded, Nor foamy curds wherein hot apples seethe Nay, not the parsley-flavour'd tongues of sheep, Could tempt o' late thy dainty appetite; But lying on the mountain out of sight Of melancholy thou hast drunken deep; While down among the yellow pastures moaning With lambs new-yean'd, where thy cool streamlets run, We saw thee loom above us, mighty one! And heard thee, like the monstrous seas intoning, Melodiously groaning! POLYPHEME. Ay me! ay me! SILENUS. Be calm, sweet Polypheme! The eagle poised o'er yonder cropping lamb Flew scared, at that big cry. POLYPHEME. Ay me! I am Lost swallow'd up, absorbed into a dream! Thro' the swift current of my frame gigantic Eddies a frantic Consuming fire. I am not what I seem. For Galatea I refuse all food, For Galatea I grow weak and wild And petulant-featured as a sickly child; For Galatea I, in desperate mood, Seek out green places in this solitude, And close my eyes, and think I am a curl Tingling, tingling lightly Against the snow-heap'd bosom swelling whitely! SILENUS. One should not break his heart for any girl. POLYPHEME. Ay me! I close my eyes in a sweet woe, And dream that I am little, fair, and sweet, For a small goddess's embraces meet, Nor huge, nor rough. It was not always so! Of old, Silenus, this great awful Me Was swoll'n with glory at the contemplation Of its enormity in yonder sea; I revell'd in the roar and consternation, When, grasping rocks with frantic acclamation, Round this frowning, Ætna-crowning head I whirl'd them, Tremendously, stupendously, and hurl'd them On the passing fleets below; And from under came the thunder of vessels crush'd asunder, And the shriek, faint and weak, of the mortals in their wonder, And the sea rolled underneath, and the winds began to blow, And above the desolation, drunk with rage, I took my station, With my waving arms expanded and my crimson eye aglow, And to earth's reverberation, Roar'd ‘Ho! ho! ho!’ SILENUS. Cyclops! sweet Cyclops!— POLYPHEME. Fear not! I am as weak as the eagle's callow young; Yet listen, mild old man, and interfere not. One summer day, when earth and heaven rung With thunders, and the hissing lightning stung With forkëd meteor tongue The green smooth living ocean till it shriek'd— I stood aloft on Ætna's horn and wreak'd My cruel humour with a monstrous glee: When lo! from out the rainy void did flit Bright Iris, and with tremulous foot alit On this my mountain, touching even me With her faint glory: for a moment, she Paused shudd'ring high above me: then with fleet Footstep slid downward till she reach'd my feet; And there, with many-tinctured wings serene, She waved the seas to silence, and, beguiled By her mild message, the dark ocean smiled— A palpitating lapse of oily green, With silvery glimmers here and there between The shadows of the clouds that, dewy and mild, Parted and flutter'd:—when, with radiant head Plunging among the mountain mists, she fled. But, as the vapours fleam'd away, behold! I saw far down upon the brown sea-strand A nymph who held aloft in pearly hand A white-tooth'd comb, and comb'd her locks of gold Over a dank and ship-wreck'd sailor-lad,— On whose sad eyelids a faint radiance lay, Robb'd from some little homestead far away, Some silent hearth that wearily would wait, For that faint smile which left it desolate, And hush itself and watch and yearn and pray. Oh! tenderly she comb'd her locks of gold, Over that gently-sleeping sailor-lad, Stretch'd 'mid the purple dulse and rock-weed cold; And all the while she sang a ditty sad, To deep division of the wave that roll'd Up to her feet, like a huge snake that springs At two bright butterflies with golden wings: Marinere, O Marinere, Waken, waken! Sleep-o'ertaken, Look upon me, with no fear, Look, and see, and hear: Underneath the white-tooth'd waves, Sleep your comrades in their caves; Coral grottoes are their bed, Purple plants stir overhead, All around black weeds are twined, Frozen still without a wind; And the sea-nymphs in distress Pluck dark flowers all odourless, Growing deep in caverns clear, Gently to bestrew their bier. Under the sea They sleep—ah me! They have slept for many a year. Marinere, O Marinere, Wake not, wake not, Slumber break not, Close your eyelids with no fear, Do not see, nor hear! Far above the silence deep, Where your gentle comrades sleep, Rolls the sea and foams the storm, Horrors thicken, terrors swarm, And the sea-nymphs, lightning-led, Flash about white-garmented; But below the Storm-god's frown, Sleep the shipwreck'd fathoms down— Ocean-flowers are on the bier, Foam-bells hang in every ear! Under the sea They sleep—ah me! They shall sleep for many a year. SILENUS. That was the song she sang? POLYPHEME. It was. But ill Those tender accents fill This rocky breast, whose distant roar Frightens those white waves seaward from the shore. For they trembled, tinkling, twining, For melodious combining, While her yellow locks fell shining To her knees, While the Storm, with bright eyes glistening, Thro' its cloud-veil looking at her, Hung breathlessly and listening On the seas: And in the sun she sat her, While her voice went pitter-patter, Pitter-patter, like the clatter Of bright rain on boughs of trees! Then ho! with my great stride, Down the steep mountain side, I sprang unto her, with mine arms extended! Her bright locks gleam'd afraid, Like a sunbeam trapt in shade, In my deep shadow, and the music ended: And she rose erect to fly, Panting, moaning, and her cry Met the lifted cry of Ocean, and they blended! While earth reel'd under, Downward I bore, With step of thunder, On to the shore; And in shrieking amaze, With eyes fasten'd in fear— Like a star's firm gaze When a cloud draws near— On the horror that came With an eye of flame, She leapt to the water, All woebegone; And her bright locks shone And tript and distraught her, But the water caught her And push'd her on! From billow to billow, With wild locks streaming And tangling oft; From billow to billow, Dark-green, or gleaming Like doves' wings soft, From billow to billow, Panting and screaming, With white hands beaming And waving aloft! Then, coming hideous On to the tide, I spurn'd the perfidious Foam aside, And follow'd her, dashing Thro' storm sublime, Flashing, crashing, Splashing-splashing On the seaweed's slippery slime! The billows clomb up, With flash of foam up, My loins and thighs; Till they gleam'd and fleam'd, With clangor and anger, And around me upstream'd With their wild white eyes! Till panting, choking, Dripping and soaking, With nostrils smoking, I halted, spitting, Spurting, chin-deep, And saw her sitting Where gulls were flitting Far out on the deep; And all around her with gentle motion One smooth soft part of the murmurous ocean Had gone to sleep! Then waving her hands, And shaking her locks, To the ocean sands, To the purple rocks Under the foam, To the sea-caves brown, She sank to her home, Down! down! down! down! And the sea grew black In her shining track, And the waters green Darken'd afar; And the one thing seen Was the steadfast star Of my round Eye red, Rolling immense With a pain intense In my rocky head, Mid the white foam wreathing Around wind-led, And the great sea seething Down to deep breathing, Like a monster panting, on its sandy bed! SILENUS. Most musical Cyclops! POLYPHEME. Hush!—Unto the beach I wearily strode, with great head bow'd, and dragg'd Foot-echoes after me; and with no speech, On yonder shore, weedy and wet and cragg'd, I stood, and in an agony of pain Look'd out with widening eyeball on the main. Lo! far away a white wind glided dim O'er the cloud-cover'd bright'ning ocean-rim, And violet shadows here and there were trail'd Over the waters: then behold the sun Flasht pale across the waste, and one by one, Like sea-gulls dripping rain, rose ships white-sail'd. All else was silence, save monotonous moan Of the broad-chested billows, till the warm Light kindled all things, and I loomed alone— The one huge cloud remaining of the storm; And in the awfulness of that strange hour A change came over my big throbbing breast, And the soft picture of the calm had power To move my mountainous bulk with vague unrest!— SILENUS. Weep not, O Cyclops—lest thy tears should roll Down oceanward and brain the grazing sheep! POLYPHEME. Ay me, ay me, the passion in my soul! Ay me, her glory haunts me, and I weep!— O, I would give away the world to be As soft, as sweet, as fleecy-limb'd as she, As tiny and as tender and as white As her mild loveliness! With two soft eyes such as mere men possess, Two pretty little dewy eyes, that might Interpret me aright! SILENUS. Amazement!—Polypheme, whom vast Poseidon Spawn'd upon Thoosa in the salted brine, Thou who canst strangle fleets, and sit astride on Ætna and roar thine origin divine! Wrong not thyself, thy beauty, and thy sire! See! where thy mighty shadow stretches wide Down the steep mountain side, And see! that eyeball of immortal fire! Had wanton Helen, Paris' love-sick toy, Beheld thee, Polypheme, Hill-haunting Echo had not found a theme In ruin and the ten years' war of Troy! POLYPHEME. And is it so? SILENUS. By Ganymede bright eyed, By—by— POLYPHEME. Enough—let us return. I stood, When she had flown, in meditative mood; Then, raising up my resinous hands, I cried: ‘O thou from whose huge loins I darkling came, King of all ocean and its wondrous races, Return, return, the nymph to my embraces, Or, thro' thy lips ooze-dripping, name her. name!’ And o'er the sands did a low murmur creep, Whispering ‘Galatea;’ and, deep-pain'd, I vaguely knew, like one who dreams in sleep, She was a goddess of the sacred deep, Not to be lightly woo'd or roughly gain'd. SILENUS. O pitiful! and you— POLYPHEME. In the dim birth Of the strange love that stirs my hid blood's fountains, As unborn earthquakes trouble springs in mountains, I look'd abroad upon the fair green earth; And lo, all things that lived, all things that stirr'd, Unto the very daisy closing up In my great shade its crimson-tippëd cup, And the small lambs, and every little bird Seem'd to abhor and dread, avoid and fear me; And in an agony of hate for all, I cried ‘How can a thing so sweet, so small, So gentle, love me—or be happy near me?’ Whereon I sadly clomb the cliffs and made A looking-glass of yonder ocean, where Startled by my long shade The silver-bellied fishes rose afraid; But with a lover's hand I smooth'd my hair To sleekness, parting it with care, And husht the rugged sorrow of my brow— Then, stooping softly o'er the dimpled mirror, I shaped my face to a sweet smile—as now! SILENUS. O agony! help, help, ye gods! O terror! Hide me! POLYPHEME. What ails thee? Ha! SILENUS. O Ocean's child— Cyclops! My heart, with admiration rent, Fainted and cried with its deep ravishment Because you look'd so beauteous when you smiled! POLYPHEME. Thou liest!—and (ay me) you shrunk in fear As silly younglings shrink at something hateful; Yet tremble not:—to a lorn lover's ear, Ev'en flattery so base as thine is grateful. Ay me ay me—I am A great sad mountain in whose depths doth roam My small soul, wandering like a gentle lamb That bleats from place to place and has no home; But prison'd among rocks Can just behold afar A land where honey-flowing rivers are And gentle shepherds with their gentle flocks: For even so my timid soul looks round On beauteous living things—that creep and seem, To this vast Eye, like insects on the ground— From whose companionship 'tis shut and bound Within this mountain of a Polypheme! SILENUS. Most melancholy Cyclops, be consoled! POLYPHEME. My heart is like those blubbery crimson blots That float on the dank tide in oozy spots; It is as mild as patient flocks in fold. I am as lonely as the snowy peak Of Dardanos, and, like an eagle, Love Stoops o'er me, helpless, from its eyrie above, And grasps that lamb, my Soul, within its beak. Nay, on the margin of the waters where She comes and goes like a swift gull, I sit Above these flocks, and rake my little wit To pipe upon the misty mountain air Ditties as tender as a shepherd man, Perch'd on a little hillock, half asleep, Surrounded by his silly stainless sheep, Pipes with mild pleasure and no definite plan In fields Arcadian. [He sings. White is the little hand of Galatea, That combs her yellow locks with dainty care; Bright is the fluttering hand of Galatea, When tangled, like a dove, in sunny hair. Sweet is Galatea—sweet is Galatea— Ay, so sweet! Complete is Galatea, from her feathery fingers fair To her small white mice of feet! The billows huge and hoar cease to rumble and to roar, When the white hands wave above them, like doves that shine and soar, And, as gentle, from the shore, I adore, and implore Galatea! Ho, that these limbs were meet for Galatea With soft pink kisses sweetly to enfold! Ho, had I two small eyes, that Galatea Might there my gentle gentle heart behold! Dear is Galatea—dear is Galatea— Ay, so dear! No peer has Galatea, but her bosom is so cold And her eyes so full of fear! When the great seas wildly rise, there is terror in her eyes, And she trembles in sweet wonder, like a bird that storms surprise,— And before my tender cries, and my sighs, swiftly flies Galatea! Under the white sea-storm sits Galatea, While overhead the sea-birds scream in flocks, In deep-green darkness sitteth Galatea, Combing out sunshine from her golden locks! Fair sits Galatea—fair sits Galatea— Ay, so fair! Ho, there sits Galatea, in the shade of purple rocks, Mid the fountain of her hair! Ho, would I were the waves, on whose crest the tempest raves, So might I still the tempest that my raging bulk outbraves, For the dark-green stillness laves, and enslaves, and encaves Galatea! SILENUS. Comfort, O Cyclops, comfort! There is sure Some remedy for such a wound as this: Red wine, I say again: the plump God's kiss Is sweeter far than honey, rich and pure. POLYPHEME. Alas, not he whose temples Artemis Bound with weird herbs and poison-snakes that hiss But sting not—wise Asclepios—could cure! For evermore, Silenus, when my brain Lies in a dream just conscious of its pain, And my full heart throbs tenderly and rockingly, Far out upon the bosom of the main She flashes up, green-kirtled, and laughs mockingly. Thrice has her smile enticed me to the chin Thro' the great waves that round me bite and bark, And gleam'd away and left me in the dark. Alas, that I must woo and never win! Alas, that I am foul while she is fair! Alas, that this red Eye, my only one, Like a brown lizard looking on the sun, Turns green in her bright mist of yellow hair! SILENUS. Majestic Cyclops! Heir of the huge Sea! God-like,—like those great heavens that oversheen us! One-eyed, like the bright Day! Wilt thou by me, Thy servant, be advised? POLYPHEME. Speak on, Silenus. SILENUS. Behold!—Beneath the many-tinctured west hid, Fades Phoibos crimson-crested, And the faint image of his parting light On the deep Sea broad-breasted Fades glassily; while down the mountain height Behind us, slides the purple shadow'd Night. Come in!—and from your cellar iced by springs Drag forth the god of wine, And listen to him as he chirps and sings His songs delicious, dulcet, and divine: Throned in the brain, magnificently wise, And blowing warmly out thro' kindled eyes All vapours vapid, vague, and vain. Seek the god's counsel, Cyclops, I beseech thee; 'Tis he alone, if once his magic reach thee, Can cure Love's panting heat or shivering pain. POLYPHEME. He cannot make me fair! SILENUS. Phoo!—He will teach thee To lift thy dreamy gaze from the soft sod, And rise erect, big-hearted, self-reliant, On Ætna's horn—with leathern lungs defiant— No minnow-hearted grampus of a god! And—then in the quick flush and exultation Of that proud inspiration, Wine in his nostrils, Polypheme will be In Polypheme's own estimation A match for any girl on land or sea. Then, furiously, gloriously rash, Grasp Opportunity, that, passing by On the sheet-lightning with a moment's flash, Haunts us for ever with its meteor eye; And—grasp the thing thou pantest for in vain, Ay, hold her fast, and for a space entreat her— But, if she still be deaf to thy sad pain, Why, hearken to the mad god in thy brain, And make a meal of trouble—that is, eat her! XI. PENELOPE. Whither, Ulysses, whither dost thou roam, Rolled round with wind-led waves that render dark The smoothly-spinning circle of the sea? Lo, Troy has fallen, fallen like a tower, And the mild sunshine of degenerate days Sleeps faintly on its ruins. One by one, Swift as the sparkle of a star, the ships Have dipt up moistly from the under-world, And plumëd warriors, standing in their prows, Stretching out arms to wives and little ones That crowd with seaward faces on the beach, Have flung their armour off and leapt and swam Ere yet the homeward keels could graze the sand. And these—the gaunt survivors of thy peers— Have landed, shone upon by those they love, And faded into happy happy homes; While I, the lonely woman, hugging close The comfort of thine individual fame, Still wait and yearn and wish towards the sea; And all the air is hollow of my joy: The seasons come and go, the hour-glass runs, The day and night come punctual as of old; But thy deep strength is in the solemn dawn, And thy proud step is in the plumëd noon, And thy grave voice is in the whispering eve; And all the while, amid this dream of thee, In restless resolution oceanward, I sit and ply my sedentary task, And fear that I am lonelier than I know. Yea, love, I am alone in all the world, The past grows dark upon me where I wait, With eyes that hunger seaward and a cheek Grown like the sampler coarse-complexionëd. For in the shadow of thy coming home I sit and weave a weary housewife's web, Pale as the silkworm in the cone; all day I sit and weave this weary housewife's web, And in the night with fingers swift as frost Unweave the weary labour of the day. Behold how I am mock'd!—Suspicion Mumbles my name between his toothless gums; And while I ply my sedentary task, They come to me, mere men of hollow clay, Gross-mouth'd and stain'd with wine they come to me, And whisper odious comfort, and upbraid The love that follows thee where'er thou art, That follows, and perchance, with thy moist cheek, Dips on the dozy bottom of the world. They come, Ulysses, and they seek to rob Thy glory of its weaker wearier half. They tell me thou art dead; nay, they have brought To these cold ears that bend above the web Whispers that thou, no wiser than thy peers, Hast pluckt upon the windy plain of Troy A flower thou shrinest in a distant land, A chamber'd delicacy drowsy-eyed, Pink-lidded, wanton, like the queen who witch'd The fatal apple out of Paris' palm. And I—and I—ah me, I rise my height, In matron majesty that melts in tears, And chide them from me with a tongue that long Hath lost the trick of chiding: what avails? They heed me not, rude men, they heed me not; And he thou leftest here to guard me well, He, the old man, is helpless, and his eyes Are yellow with the money-minting lie That thou art dead. O husband, what avails? They gather on me, till the sense grows cold And huddles in upon the steadfast heart; And they have dragged a promise from my lips To choose a murderer of my love for thee, To choose at will from out the rest one man To slay me with his kisses in the dark, Whene'er the weary web at which I work Be woven: so, all day, I weave the web; And in the night with fingers like a thief's Unweave the silken sorrow of the day. The years wear on. Telemachus, thy son, Grows sweetly to the height of all thy hope: More woman-like than thee, less strong of limb, Yet worthy thee; and likest thy grave mood, When, in old time, among these fields, thine eye Would kindle on a battle far away. And thy proud nostrils, drinking the mild breath Of tannëd haycocks and of slanted sheaves, Swell suddenly, as if a trumpet spake. Hast thou forgotten how of old he loved To toy with thy great beard, and sport with thee, And how, in thy strong grasp, he leapt and seem'd A lambkin dandled in a lion's paw? But change hath come, Troy is an old wife's tale, And sorrow stealeth early on thy son, Whom sojourn with my weeping womanhood Hath taught too soon a young man's gentlsness. Behold now, how his burning boy-face turns With impotent words beyond all blows of arm On those rude men that rack thy weary wife! Then turns to put his comfort on my cheek, While sorrow brightens round him—as the grey Of heaven melts to silver round a star! Return, Ulysses, ere too late, too late: Return, immortal warrior, return: Return, return and end the weary web! For day by day I look upon the sea And watch each ship that dippeth like a gull Across the long straight line afar away Where heaven and ocean meet; and when the winds Swoop to the waves and lift them by the hair, And the long storm-roar gathers, on my knees I pray for thee. Lo, even now, the deep Is garrulous of thy vessel tempest-tost; And on the treeless upland gray-eyed March, With blue and humid mantle backward blown, Plucks the first primrose in a blustering wind. The keels are wheel'd unto the ocean sand And eyes look outward for the homeward bound. And not a marinere, or man or boy, Scum'd and salt-blooded from the boisterous sea, Touches these shores, but straight I summon him, And bribe with meat and drink to tell good news, And question him of thee. But what avails? Thou wanderest; and my love sits all alone Upon the threshold of an empty hall. My very heart has grown a timid mouse, Peeping out, fearful, when the house is still. Breathless I listen thro' the breathless dark, And hear the cock counting the leaden hours, And, in the pauses of his cry, the deep Swings on the flat sand with a hollow clang; And, pale and burning-eyed, I fall asleep When, with wild hair, across the weary wave Stares the sick Dawn that brings thee not to me. Ulysses, come! Ere traitors leave the mark Of spread wine-dripping fingers on the smooth And decent shoulders that now stoop for thee! I am not young or happy as of old, When, awed by thy male strength, my face grew dark At thy grave footfall, with a serious joy, Or when, with blushing backward-looking face, I came a bride to thine inclement realm, Trembling and treading fearfully on flowers. I am not young and beauteous as of old; And much I fear that when we meet thy face May startle darkly at the work of years, And turn to hide a disappomted pang, And then, with thy grave pride, subdue itself Into such pity as is love stone-dead. But thou, thou too, art old, dear lord—thy hair Is threaded with the silver foam—thy heart Is weary from the blows of cruel years; And there is many a task thy wife can do To soothe thy sunset season and make calm Thy journey down the slow descent to Sleep. Return, return, Ulysses, ere I die! Upon this desolate, desolate strand I wait, Wearily stooping o'er the weary web— An alabaster woman, whose fix'd eyes Stare seaward, whether it be storm or calm. And ever, evermore, as in a dream, I see thee gazing hither from thy ship In sunset regions where the still seas rot, And stretching out great arms whose shadows fall Gigantic on the glassy purple sea; And ever, evermore, thou lingerest, And evermore thy coming far away Aches on the burning heartstrings,—evermore Thou comest not, and I am tired and old. XII. SAPPHO: On the Leucadian Rock. 1 O sweet, sweet, sweet! While the Moon, with her dove's eyes fair, And her beautiful yellow hair, And the Sea-Snake coiling round her silvern feet, Walk'd dumbly up above in the jewell'd air Waving her luminous wings, To sit upon this crag above the sea Clasp'd close, so close, to thee, Pale with much yearning, while the murmurings Of the great waters seem'd to waft to me The name of Phaon, To whisper Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, with deep intonin, Hushfully, hushfully moaning! 2 O bliss, bliss, bliss! Though the Moon look'd pale in the sky, On thy passionate heart to lie, To cling to thy burning lips with kiss on kiss, Faintly watching the butterfly stars swim by In the track of that queenly Moon; And in a dream, clasp'd close, so close, to thee, To list and seem to be A portion of the faint monotonous tune Made for its mistress by the serpent sea, That whisper'd Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, while Dian darkening Stoop'd hushfully, hushfully, harkening! 3 O pain, pain, pain! While the Moon, in a sky as clear As of old, walks on, and I hear Her palpitating foot on the living main, While, under her feet, the green sea-snake creeps near Hissing with scales that gleam, To stand upon this crag beside the sea And dream, and dream, of thee— With clench'd white hands, set teeth, and robes that stream Behind me in the wind, while audibly The waves moan Phaon, Shriek Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, with deep intoning, Mournfully, mournfully, moaning! 4 O rest, rest, rest!— While the Moon with her virgin light Thro' eternities of night Dumbly paces on to the east from the west,— To mingle with the waves that under the height Murmur along the shore, To mix my virgin love, my agony, Into the serpent sea That Dian seeks to silence evermore, To cling to those white skirts and moan of thee, O Phaon, Phaon, Restless for love of Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, Phaon, with ceaseless motion Soothed by the soother of Ocean! XIII. THE SYREN. Ah, kiss me, Sweetest, while on yellow sand Murmurs the breaking billow, And smoothe my silken ringlets with thy hand, And make my breast thy pillow; And clasp me, Dearest, close to lip and cheek And bosom softly sighing, While o'er the green sea, in one orange streak, The summer day is dying! Kiss, kiss, as one that presses to his mouth A vine-bunch bursting mellow, In this lone islet of the sleepy south Fringëd with smooth sands yellow: A twilight of fresh leaves endusks us round, Flowers at our feet are springing, And wave on wave breaks smoothly to the sound Of my sweet singing! EUMOLPUS. Is it the voice of mine own Soul I hear? Or some white sybil of the spherëd ocean? And are these living limbs that lie so near, Stirring around me with a serpent-motion? Is this a tress of yellow yellow hair, Around my finger in a ring enfolden? Whose face is this, so musically fair, That swoons upon my ken thro' vapours golden? What sad song withers on the odorous air? Where am I, where? Where is my country and that vision olden? THE SYREN. I sang thee hither in thy bark to land With deftly warbled measure, I wove a witch's spell with fluttering hand, Till thou wert drunken, Dearest, with much pleasure. At hush of noon I had thee at my knee, And round thy finger pink I wound a curl, And singing smiled beneath with teeth of pearl, Of what had been, what was, and what should be Sang dying ditties three! And lo! thy blood was ravish'd with the theme, And lo! thy face was pale with drowsy dream, While stooping low, with rich lips tremulous, I kiss thee thus!—and thus! EUMOLPUS. Thy kisses trance me to a vision wan Of what hath been and neverm re will be. O little fishing-town Sicilian, I can behold thee sitting by the sea! O little red-tiled town where I was born! O days ere yet I sail'd from mortal ken! Why did I launch upon the deep forlorn, Nor fish in shallow pools with simple men? It was a charm; for while I rockt at ease Within our little bay, There came a melody across the seas From regions far away; And ah! I fell into a swooning sleep, And all the world had changed before I knew,— And I awoke upon a glassy deep With not a speck of land to break the view, And tho' I was alone, I did not weep, For I was singing too! I sang! I sang! and with mine oars kept time Unto the rude sweet rhyme, And went a-sailing on into the west Blown on by airs divine, Singing for ever on a wild-eyed quest For that immortal minstrel feminine; And night and day went past, until I lost All count of time, yet still did melodise; And sun and stars beheld me from their skies; And ships swam by me, from whose decks storm-tost Rudeseamen gazed with terror-glazëd eyes. And still I found not her for whom I sought, Yet smiled without annoy, To ply the easy oar, and take no thought, And sing, was such sweet joy!— Then Tempest came, and to and from the sky I rose and fell in that frail bark of mine, While the snake Lightning, with its blank bright eye, Writhed fierily in swift coils serpentine Along the slippery brine; And there were days when dismal sobbing Rain Made melancholy music for the brain, And hours when I shriek'd out and wept in woe Prison'd about by chilly still affright, While all around dropt hushëd flakes of Snow Melting and mingling down blue chasims of night. Yet evermore, I heard that voice sublime Twining afar its weirdly woven song, And ever, ever more, mine oars kept time, And evermore I utterëd in song My yearnings sad or merry, faint or strong. Ah me! my love for her afar away, My yearning and my burning night and day! In dreams alone, I met her in still lands, And knelt in tears before her, And could not sing, but only wring mine hands, Adore her and implore her! She glisten'd past me as a crane that sails Above the meeting of the ocean-gales, With waft of broad slow wing to regions new; And tho' I follow'd her from place to place, She held her veil dew-spangled to her face, And I could merely feel her eyes of blue Steadfastly gazing thro'! Wherefore my heart had broken quite,—but then I would awake again,— To see the oily water steep'd in rest While, glistering in many-colour'd flakes Harming me not, lay brooding on its breast Leviathan and all the ocean-snakes, And on the straight faint streak afar the round Moist eye of morning lookt thro' dewy air, And all was still, a joyous calm profound,— And I would break the charm with happy sound To find the world so fair! And lo! I drank the rain-drops and was glad, And smote the bird of ocean down and ate; And ocean harm'd me not, and monsters sad That people ocean and the desolate Abysses spared me,—charmëd by the song Warbled wildly as I went along. Yet day and night sped on, and I grew old Before I knew; and lo! My hands were wither'd, on my bosom cold There droopt a beard of snow,— And raising hands I shriek'd, I cried a curse On that weird voice that twinëd me from home; And echoes of the awful universe Answer'd me; and the deep with lips of foam Mock'd me and spat upon me; and the things That people ocean rose and threaten'd ill, Yea also air-born harpies waving wings, Because I could not sing to charm them still. I was alone, the shadow of a man, Haunting the trackless waste of waves forlorn, Blown on by pitiless rains and vapours wan, Plaining for that small town Sicilian, Where, in the sweet beginning, I was born! THE SYREN. Ah, weep not, Dearest! lean upon my breast, While sunset darkens stilly, And Dian poises o'er the slumberous west Her silver sickle chilly; The eyes of heaven are opening, the leaves Fold dark and dewy round the closing roses, In lines of foam the breaking billow heaves, Each thing that gladdens and each thing that grieves Dip slow to sweet reposes. EUMOLPUS. O voice that lured me on, I know thee now! O melancholy eyes, how bright ye beam! O kiss, thy touch is dewy on my brow! Sweet Spirit of my dream! THE SYREN. Name thy love, and I am she, Name thy woe, and look on me, Name the weary melody That led thee hither o'er the sea,— Then call to mind my ditties three Of what hath been, what is, and what shall be! EUMOLPUS. Ah woe! ah woe! I see thee and I clasp thee, and I know! Sing to me, Sweetest, while the shadows grow— Sing low! sing low! Oh, sweet were slumber now, at last, at last, For I am sick of wandering to and fro, And ah! my singing-days are nearly pass'd— Sing low! sing low! sing low! THE SYREN. Love with wet cheek, Joy with red lips apart, Hope with her blue eyes dim from looking long, Ambition with thin hand upon his heart— Of which shall be the song? Of one, of one, Who loved till life was done, For life with him was loving, tho' she slew his love with wrong. Then, on a winter day, When all was lost and his young brow was gray, He knelt before an Altar pilëd proud With bleachëd bones and fruits and garlands gay, And cried aloud:— ‘Have I brought Joy, and slain her at thy feet? Have I brought Peace, for thy cold kiss to kill, Have I brought Youth crownëd with wildflowers sweet, With sandals dewy from a morning hill, For thy gray solemn eyes to fright and chill? Have I brought Scorn the pale and Hope the fleet, And First-Love in her lily winding-sheet? And art thou pitiless still? O Poesy, thou nymph of fire, Grandest of that fair quire Which in the dim beginning stoop'd and fell,— So beauteous yet so awful, standing tall Upon the mountain-tops where mortals dwell, Seeing strange visions of the end of all, And pallid from the white-heat glare of Hell! Is there no prophecy, far-seeing one, To seal upon these lips that yearn to sing? Can nought be gain'd again? can nought be won? Is there no utterance in this suffering, Is there no voice for any human thing?’ Then, smiling in the impotence of pain, His sweet breath at the Altar did he yield,— While she he loved, afar across the main, Stoop'd down to break a weary people's chain, And crown a hero on a battle-field! EUMOLPUS. Ah no! ah no! So sad a theme is too much woe! Sing to me sweetlier, since thou lovest me so— Sing low; sing low! THE SYREN. Sisters we, the syrens three, Fame and Love and Poesy! In the solitude we sit, On the mountain-tops we flit, From the islands of the sea Luring man with melody; Sisters three we seem to him Foating over waters dim,— Syrens, syrens three, are we— Fame and Love and Poesy! EUMOLPUS. Ah woe! ah woe! That is the song I heard so long ago! That is the song That lured me long: Those were the three I saw, with arms of snow And ringlets waving yellow, beckoning, While on the violet deep I floated slow, With little heart to sing; And lo! they faded as I leapt to land, And their weird music wither'd on the air, And I was lying drowsy on the sand Smiling and toying with thy yellow hair! THE SYREN. Sisters we, the syrens three, Fame and Love and Poesy, Sitting singing in the sun, While the weary marinere Passes on or faints in fear,— Sisters three, yet only one, When he cometh near! Charmëd sight and charmëd sound Hover quietly around, Mine are dusky bowers and deep, Closëd lids and balmy sleep, Kisses cool for fever'd cheeks and warmth for eyes that weep! EUMOLPUS. Sing low! sing low! Thou art more wondrous fair than mortals know. Bringest thou, Beautiful, or peace or woe? Close up each eyelid with a warm rich kiss And let me listen while the sunlights go. I cannot bear a time so still as this, Unbroken by thy voice's fall and flow. Sing to me, Beautiful! Sing low, sing low, sing low! THE SYREN. Love with wet cheek, Joy with red lips apart, Hope with her blue eyes dim from looking long, Ambition with thin hand upon his heart— Of which shall be the song? Ah, woe! ah, woe! For Love is dead and wintry winds do blow. Yea, Love is dead; and by her funeral bier Ambition gnaws the lip and sheds no tear; And in the outer chamber Hope sits wild, Watching the faces in the fire and weeping; And at the threshold Joy the little child With rosy cheeks runs leaping, And stops.—while in the misty distance creeping Down western hills the large red sun sinks slow— To see Death's footprints on the still white snow. Ah, Love has gone, and all the rest must go. Sing low! sing low! sing low! EUMOLPUS. It is a song that slays me. Sing no more. THE SYREN. Ah, Sweet, the song is o'er!— The ocean-hum is hush'd, 'tis end of day, The long white foam fades faintly, The orange sunset dies into the gray Where star on star swims saintly. Hast thou not sung? and is not song enough? Hast thou not loved? and is not loving all? Art thou not weary of the wayfare rough, Or is there aught of life thou wouldst recall? Ah no, ah no! The life came sweetly—sweetly let it go! Mine are dusky bowers and deep, Closëd eyes and balmy sleep, Kisses cool for fever'd cheeks and warmth for eyes that weep! EUMOLPUS. Thou art the gentle witch that men call Death! Ah, Beauteous, I am weary, and would rest! THE SYREN. Lie very softly, Sweet, and let thy breath Fade calmly on my breast! Call me Love or call me Fame, Call me Death or Poesy, Call me by whatever name Seemeth sweetest unto thee:— I anoint thee, I caress thee; With my dark reposes bless thee, I redeem thee, I possess thee! I can never more forsake thee! Slumber, slumber, peacefully, Slumber calm and dream of me, Till I touch thee, and awake thee! EUMOLPUS. Diviner far than song divine can tell! Thine eyes are dim with dreams of that awaking! Yea, let me slumber, for my heart is breaking With too much love. Farewell! farewell! farewell! THE SYREN. Charmëd sight and charmëd sound Close the weary one around! Charmëd dream of charmëd sleep Make his waiting sweet and deep! Husht be all things! Let the spell Duskly on his eyelids dwell! EUMOLPUS. Farewell! farewell! farewell! THE SYREN. O melancholy waters, softly flow! O Stars, shine softly, dropping dewy balm! O Moon walk on in sandals white as snow! O Winds, be calm, be calm! For he is tired with wandering to and fro, Yea, weary with unrest to see and know. O charmëd sound That hoverest around! O voices of the Night! Sing low! sing low! sing low! XIV. A VOICE FROM ACADEME. Over this azure poplar glade The sunshine, fainting high above, Ebbs back from woolly clouds that move Like browsing lambs and cast no shade; And straight before me, faintly seen Thro' emerald boughs that intervene, The visible sun turns white and weaves Long webs of silver thro' the leaves. The grassy sward beneath my foot Is soft as lips of lambs and beeves. How cool those harebells at the root Of yonder tree, that dimly dance Thro' dews of their own radiance! Yonder I see the river run, Half in the shade, half in the sun; And as I near its shallow brink The sparkling minnows, where they lie With silver bellies to the sky, Flash from me in a shower and sink. I stand in shadows cool and sweet, But in the mirror at my feet The heated azure heavens wink. All round about this shaded spot, Whither the sunshine cometh not, Where all is beautiful repose— I know the kindled landskip glows; And further, flutter golden showers On proud Athenai white with towers, And catching from the murmurous sea, [Stain'd with deep shadows as of flowers And dark'ning down to purple bowers Thro' which the sword-fish darts in glee,] A strife that cometh not to me. For in this place of shade and sound, Hid from the garish heat around, I feel like one removed from strain And fever of the happy brain— Where thoughts thrill fiery into pain: Like one who, in the pleasant shade The peaceful pulseless dead have made, Walking in silence, just perceives The gaudy world from which he went Subdue itself to his content, Like that white globe beyond the leaves! XV. PYGMALION THE SCULPTOR. ‘Materiem superabat opus.’ 1.Shadow. Upon the very morn I should have wed Death put his silence in a mourning house; And, coming fresh from feast, I saw her lie In stainless marriage samite, white and cold, With orange blossoms in her hair, and gleams Of the ungiven kisses of the bride Playing about the edges of her lips. Then I, Pygmalion, kiss'd her as she slept, And drew my robe across my face whereon The midnight revel linger'd dark, and pray'd; And the sore trouble hollow'd out my heart To hatred of a harsh unhallow'd youth As I glode forth. Next, day by day, my soul Grew conscious of itself and of its fief Within the shadow of her grave: therewith, Waken'd a thirst for silence such as dwells Under the ribs of death: whence slowly grew Old instincts that had trancëd me to tears In mine unsinew'd boyhood, sympathies Full of faint odours and of music faint Like buds of roses blowing;—till I felt Her voice come down from heaven on my soul, And stir it as a wind that droppeth down Unseen, unfelt, unheard, until its breath Troubles the shadows in a sleeping lake. And the voice said, ‘Pygmalion,’ and ‘Behold,’ I answer'd, ‘I am here;’ when thus the voice: ‘Put men behind thee—take thy tools, and choose A block of marble white as is a star, Cleanse it and make it pure, and fashion it After mine image: heal thyself: from grief Comes glory, like a rainbow from a cloud. For surely life and death, which dwell apart In grosser human sense, conspire to make The breathless beauty and eternal joy Of sculptured shapes in stone. Wherefore thy life Shall purify itself and heal itself In the long toil of love made meek by tears.’ I barr'd the entrance-door to this my tower Against the hungry world, I hid above The mastiff-murmur of the town, I pray'd In my pale chamber. Then I wrought, and chose A rock of marble white as is a star, And to her silent image fashion'd clay, And purified myself and heal'd myself In the long toil of love made meek by tears. 2.The Marble Life. The multitudinous light oppress'd me not, But smiled subdued, as a young mother smiles, When fearful lest the sunbeam of the smile Trouble the eyelids of the babe asleep. As Ocean murmurs when the storm is past And keeps the echoed thunders many days, My solitude was troublous for a time: Wherefore I should have harden'd; but the clay Grew to my touch, and brighten'd, and assumed Fantastic images of natural things, Which, melting as the fleecy vapours melt Around the shining cestus of the moon, Made promise of the special shape I loved. Withdrawing back, I gazed. The unshaped stone Took outline in the dusk, as rocks unhewn Seen from afar thro' floating mountain mists Gather strange forms and human lineaments. And thus mine eye was filled with what I sought As with a naked image, thus I grew Self-credulous of the form the stone would wear, And creeping close I strove to fashion clay After the vision. Day and night, I drew New comfort from my grief; my tears became As honey'd rain that makes the woodbine sweet, Until my task assumed a precious strength Wherewith I fortified mine inner ear Against the pleadings of the popular tongue That babbled at my door; and when there dawn'd A hand as pure as milk and cold as snow, A small white hand, a little radiant hand, That peep'd out perfect from the changing mass, And seem'd a portion of some perfect shape Unfreed, imprison'd in the stone,—I wept Warm tears of utter joy, and kiss'd the hand, As sweet girl-mothers kiss the newly born, Weak as a mother. Then I heard no more The murmurous swarm beneath me, women and men; But, hoarded in my toil, I counted not The coming and the going of the sun: Save when I swoon'd to sleep before the stone, And dream'd, and dreaming saw the perfect shape Emblazon'd, like the rainbow in a stream, On the transparent tapestry of sleep. Ah me, the joy, the glory, and the dream, When like a living wonder senseless stone Smiles to the beating of a heart that hangs Suspended in the tumult of the blood! To the warm touch of my creating hand The marble was as snow; and like the snow Whereon the molten sunshine gleams as blood, It soften'd, glow'd, and changed. As one who stands Beneath the cool and rustling dark to watch The shadow of his silently beloved Cross o'er the lighted cottage blind and feel The brightness of the face he cannot see, So stood I, trembling, while the shape unborn Darken'd across the white and milky mass And left the impress of its loveliness To glorify and guide me. As I wrought The Past came back upon me, like the ghost Of the To-Come. Whate'er was pure and white, Soft-shining with a snow-like chastity, Came back from childhood, and from that dim land Which lies behind the horizon of the sense, Felt though forgotten; vanishings divine Of the strange vapours many-shaped and fair Which moisten sunrise when the eye of heaven Openeth dimly from the underworld: Faint instincts of the helpless babe that smiles At the sweet pictures in its mother's eyes And lieth with a halo round its head Of beauty uncompleted: memories Of young Love's vivid heaven-enthronëd light, By whose moist rays the pensive soul of youth Was troubled at the fountains, like a well Wherein the mirror'd motion of a star Lies dewy and deep;—and, amid all, there dwelt A vaguer glory, deeper sense of power, Scarce conscious of itself yet ruling all, Like the hid heart which rocks the jaded blood, Brightens the cheek, throbs music to the brain. Yet dwells within the breast scarce recognised, Save when our pulses warn us and in fear We pause to listen.—Even so at times Those visions tranced me to a dumb dismay, And, sudden music thronging in mine ears, I hearken'd for that central loveliness Whose magic guided and created all. Then languor balmier than the blood i' the veins When youth and maiden mingle and the moon Breathes on the odorous room wherein they lie Chamber'd as in a folded rose's leaves, Oppress'd me, and a lover's rapture fill'd My soul to swooning. Lo, I kiss'd the stone, And toy'd with the cold hand, and look'd for light In the dim onward-looking marble eyes, And smooth'd the hair until it seem'd to grow Soft as the living ringlets tingling warm Against a heaving bosom. At her feet I knelt, and tingled to the finger-tips To gaze upon her breathless loveliness— Like one who, shuddering, gazes on a shrine From human eyes kept holy. Then at last, Fair-statured, noble, like an awful thing Frozen upon the very verge of life, And looking back along eternity With rayless eyes that keep the shadow Time, She rose before me in the milky stone, White-limb'd, immortal; and I gazed and gazed Like one that sees a vision, and in awe Half hides his face, yet looks, and seems to dream. 3.The Sin. Blue night. I threw the lattice open wide, Drinking the odorous air; and from my height I saw the watch-fires of the town and heard The gradual dying of the murmurous day. Then, as the twilight deepen'd, on her limbs The silver lances of the stars and moon Were shatter'd, and the shining fragments fell Resplendent at her feet. The Cyprian star Quiver'd to liquid emerald where it hung On the ribb'd ledges of the darkening hills, Gazing upon her; and, as in a dream, Methought the marble, underneath that look, Stirr'd—like a bank of stainless asphodels Kiss'd into tumult by a wind of light. Whereat there swam upon me utterly A drowsy sense wherein my holy dream Was melted, as a pearl in wine: bright-eyed, Keen, haggard, passionate, with languid thrills Of insolent unrest, I watch'd the stone, And lo, I loved it: not as men love fame, Not as the warrior loves his laurel wreath, But with prelusion of a passionate joy That threw me from the height whereon I stood To grasp at Glory, and in impiousness Of sweet communing with some living Soul Chamber'd in that cold bosom. As I gazed, There was a buzz of revel in mine ears, And tinkling fragments of a song of love, Warbled by wantons over wine-cups, swam Wildly within the brain.—Then I was shamed By her pale beauty, and I scorn'd myself, And standing at the lattice dark and cool Watch'd the dim winds of twilight enter in, And draw a veil about that loveliness White, dim, and breathed on by the common air. But, like a snake's moist eye, the dewy star Of lovers drew me; and I watched it grow Large, soft, and tremulous; and as I gazed In fascinated impotence of heart, I pray'd the lifeless silence might assume A palpable life, and soften into flesh, And be a beautiful and human joy To crown my love withal; and thrice the prayer Blacken'd across my pale face with no word. But thro' the woolly silver of a cloud The cool star dripping emerald from the baths Of Ocean brighten'd in upon my tower, And touch'd the marble forehead with a gleam Soft, green, and dewy; and I said ‘the prayer Is heard!’ The live-long night, the breathless night I waited in a darkness, in a dream, Watching the snowy figure faintly seen, And ofttimes shuddering when I seem'd to see Life, like a taper burning in a skull, Gleam thro' the rayless eyes: yea, wearily I hearken'd thro' the dark and seem'd to hear The low warm billowing of a living breast, Or the slow motion of anointed limbs New-stirring into life; and, shuddering, Fearing the thing I hoped for, awful eyed, On her cold breast I placed a hand as cold And sought a fluttering heart.—But all was still, And chill, and breathless; and she gazed right on With rayless orbs, nor marvell'd at my touch: White, silent, pure, ineffable, a shape Rebuking human hope, a deathless thing, Sharing the wonder of the Sun who sends His long bright look thro' all futurity. When Shame lay heavy on me, and I hid My face, and almost hated her, my work, Because she was so fair, so human fair, Yea not divinely fair as that pure face Which, when mine hour of loss and travail came, Haunted me, out of heaven. Then the Dawn Stared in upon her: when I open'd eyes, And saw the gradual Dawn encrimson her Like blood that blush'd within her,—and behold She trembled—and I shriek'd! With haggard eyes, I gazed on her, my fame, my work, my love! Red sunrise mingled with the first bright flush Of palpable life—she trembled, stirr'd, and sigh'd— And the dim blankness of her stony eyes Melted to azure. Then, by slow degrees, She tingled with the warmth of living blood: Her eyes were vacant of a seeing soul, But dewily the bosom rose and fell, The lips caught sunrise, parting, and the breath Fainted thro' pearly teeth. I was as one Who gazes on a goddess serpent-eyed, And cannot fly, and knows to look is death. O apparition. of my work and wish! The weight of awe oppress'd me, and the air Swung as the Seas swing around drowning men. 4.Death in Life. About her brow the marble hair had clung With wavy tresses, in a simple knot Bound up and braided; but behold, her eyes Droop'd downward, as she wonder'd at herself, Then flush'd to see her naked loveliness, And trembled, stooping downward; and the hair Unloosening fell, and brighten'd as it fell, Till gleaming ringlets tingled to the knees And cluster'd round about her where she stood As yellow leaves around a lily's bud, Making a fountain round her such as clips A Naiad in the sunshine, pouring down And throwing moving shadows o'er the floor Whereon she stood and brighten'd. Wondering eyed, With softly heaving breast and outstretch'd arms, Slow as an eyeless man who gropes his way, She thrust a curving foot and touch'd the ground, And stirr'd; and, downcast-lidded, saw not me. Then as the foot descended with no sound, The whole live blood grew pink within the veins For joy of its own motion. Step by step, She paced the chamber, groping till she gain'd One sunlight-slip that thro' the curtain'd pane Crept slant—a gleaming line on wall and floor; And there, in light, she pausing sunn'd herself With half-closed eyes; while flying gleams of gold Sparkled like flies of fire among her hair, And the live blood show'd brightlier, as wine Gleams thro' a curd-white cup of porcelain. There, stirring not, she paused and sunn'd herself, With drooping eyelids that grew moist and warm, What time, withdrawn into the further dark, I watch'd her, nerveless, as a murderer stretch'd Under a nightmare of the murder'd man. And still she, downcast-lidded, saw me not; But gather'd glory while she sunn'd herself, Drawing deep breath of gladness such as earth Breathes dewily in the sunrise after rain. Then pray'd I, lifting up my voice aloud. ‘O apparition of my work and wish! Thou most divinely fair as she whose face Haunted me, out of heaven! Raise thine eyes! Live, love, as thou and I have lived and loved! Behold me—it is I—Pygmalion. Speak, Psyche, with thy human eyes and lips, Speak, to Pygmalion, with thy human soul!’ And still she, downcast-lidded, saw me not, But gather'd glory as she sunn'd herself. Yet listen'd murmuring inarticulate speech, Listen'd with ear inclined and fluttering lids, As one who lying on a bed of flowers Hearkeneth to the distant fall of waves, That cometh muffled in the drowsy hum Of bees pavilion'd among roses' leaves Near to the ears that listen. So she stood And listen'd to my voice, framing her lips After the speech; nay, when the sound had ceased, Still listen'd, with a shadow on her cheek— Like the Soul's Music, when the Soul has fled, Fading upon a dead Musician's face. But, stooping in mine awe, with outstretch'd arms, I crept to her; nor stirr'd she, till my breath Was warm upon her neck: then raised she eyes Of dewy azure, ring in ring of blue Less'ning in passionate orbs whereon my face Fell white with yearning wonder; when a cry Tore her soft lips apart, the gleaming orbs Widen'd to silvery terror, and she fled, With yellow locks that shone and arms that waved, And in the further darkness cower'd and moan'd, Dumb as a ringdove that with fluttering wings Watches a serpent in the act to spring. What follow'd was a strange and wondrous dream Wherein, half conscious, wearily and long I wooed away her fears with gentle words, Smooth gestures, and sweet smiles.—with kindness such As calms the terror of a new-yean'd lamb, So pure, it fears its shadow on the grass; And all the while thick pulses of my heart Throng'd hot in ears and eyelids,—for my Soul Seem'd swooning, deaden'd in the sense, like one Who sinks in snows, and sleeps, and wakes no more. Yet was I conscious of a hollow void, A yearning in the tumult of the blood, Her presence fill'd not, quell'd not; and I search'd Her eyes for meanings that they harbour'd not, Her face for beauty that disturb'd it not. 'Twas Psyche's face, and yet 'twas not her face, A face most fair, yet not so heavenly fair, As hers who, when my time of travail came, Haunted me, out of heaven. For its smile Brought no good news from realms beyond the sun, The lips framed heavenly nor human speech, And to the glorious windows of the eyes No Soul clomb up—to look upon the stars, And search the void for glimpses of the peaks Of that far land of morning whence it comes. Then, further, I was conscious that my face Had lull'd her fears; that close to me she came Tamer than beast, and toy'd with my great beard, And murmur'd sounds like prattled infants' speech, And yielding to my kisses kissed again. Whereat, in scorn of my pale Soul, I cried, ‘Here will I feast in honour of this night!’ And spread the board with meats and fruits and wine, And drew the curtain with a wave of arm Bidding the sunlight welcome: lastly, snatch'd A purple robe of richness from the wall, And flung it o'er her while she kiss'd and smiled, Girdling the waist with clasp and cord of gold. Then sat we, side by side. She, queenly stoled, Amid the gleaming fountain of her hair, With liquid azure orbs and rosy lips Gorgeous with honey'd kisses; I, like a man Who loves fair eyes and knows they are a fiend's, And in them sees a heav'n he knows is hell. For, like a glorious feast, she ate and drank, Staining her lips in crimson wine, and laugh'd To feel the vinous bubbles froth and burst In veins whose sparking blood was meet to be A spirit's habitation. Cup on cup I drain'd in fulness—careless as a god— A haggard bearded head upon a breast In tumult like a sun-kist bed of flowers. But ere, suffused with light, the eyes of Heaven Widen'd to gaze upon the white-arm'd Moon, Stiller than stone we reign'd there, side by side. Yea, like a lonely King whose Glory sits Beside him,—impotent of life but fair,— Brightly apparellëd I sat above The tumult of the town, as on a throne, Watching her wearily; while far a way The sunset dark'd like dying eyes that shut Under the waving of an angel's wing. 5.Shadow Three days and nights the vision dwelt with me, Three days and nights we dozed in dreadful state, Look'd piteously upon by sun and star; But the third night there pass'd a homeless sound Across the city underneath my tower, And lo! there came a roll of muffled wheels, A shrieking and a hurrying to and fro Beneath, and I gazed forth. Then far below I heard the people shriek ‘A pestilence!’ But, while they shriek'd, they carried forth their Dead, And flung them out upon the common ways, And moaning fled: while far across the hills A dark and brazen sunset ribb'd with black Glared, like the sullen eyeballs of the plague. I turn'd to her, the partner of my height: She, with bright eyeballs sick with wine, and hair Gleaming in sunset, on a couch asleep. And lo! a horror lifted up my scalp, The pulses plunged upon the heart, and fear Froze my wide eyelids. Peacefully she lay In purple stole array'd, one little hand Bruising the downy cheek, the other still Clutching the dripping goblet, and the light, With gleams of crimson on the ruinous hair, Spangling a blue-vein'd bosom whence the robe Fell back in rifled folds; but dreadful change Grew pale and hideous on the waxen face, And in her sleep she did not stir, nor dream. Therefore, it seem'd, Death pluck'd me by the sleeve, And, sweeping past, with lean forefinger touch'd The sleeper's brow and smiled; when, shrinking back, I turn'd my face away, and saw afar The brazen sullen sunset ribb'd with black Glare on her, like the eyeballs of the plague! O apparition of my work and wish! Shrieking I fled, my robe across my face, And left my glory and my woe behind, And sped, thro' pathless woods, o'er moon-lit peaks, Toward sunrise;—nor have halted since that hour, But wander far away, a homeless man, Prophetic, orphan'd both of name and fame. Nay, like a timid Phantom evermore I come and go with haggard warning eyes; And some, that sit with lemans over wine, Or dally idly with the glorious hour, Turn cynic eyes away and smile aside; And some are saved because they see me pass, And, shuddering, yet constant to their task, Look up for comfort to the silent stars. XVI. ANTONY IN ARMS. Lo, we are side by side!—One dark arm furls Around me like a serpent warm and bare; The other, lifted 'mid a gleam of pearls, Holds a full golden goblet in the air: Her face is shining through her cloudy curls With light that makes me drunken unaware, And with my chin upon my breast I smile Upon her, darkening inward all the while. And thro' the chamber curtains, backward roll'd By spicy winds that fan my fever'd head, I see a sandy flat slope yellow as gold To the brown banks of Nilus wrinkling red In the slow sunset; and mine eyes behold The West, low down beyond the river's bed, Grow sullen, ribb'd with many a brazen bar, Under the white smile of the Cyprian star. A bitter Roman vision floateth black Before me, in my dizzy brain's despite; The Roman armour brindles on my back, My swelling nostrils drink the fumes of fight: But then, she smiles upon me!—and I lack The warrior will that frowns on lewd delight, And, passionately proud and desolate, I smile an answer to the joy I hate. Joy coming uninvoked, asleep, awake, Makes sunshine on the grave of buried powers; Ofttimes I wholly loathe her for the sake Of manhood slipt away in easeful hours: But from her lips mild words and kisses break, Till I am like a ruin mock'd with flowers; I think of Honour's face—then turn to hers— Dark, like the splendid shame that she confers. Lo, how her dark arm holds me!—I am bound By the soft touch of fingers light as leaves: I drag my face aside, but at the sound Of her low voice I turn—and she perceives The cloud of Rome upon my face and round My neck she twines her odorous arms and grieves, Shedding upon a heart as soft as they Tears 'tis a hero's task to kiss away! And then she loosens from me, trembling still Like a bright throbbing robe, and bids me ‘go!’— When pearly tears her drooping eyelids fill, And her swart beauty whitens into snow; And lost to use of life and hope and will, I gaze upon her with a warrior's woe, And turn, and watch her sidelong in annoy— Then snatch her to me, flush'd with shame and joy! Once more, O Rome! I would be son of thine— This constant prayer my chain'd soul ever saith— I thirst for honourable end—I pine Not thus to kiss away my mortal breath. But comfort such as this may not be mine— I cannot even die a Roman death: I seek a Roman's grave, a Roman's rest— But, dying, I would die upon her breast! XVII. FINE WEATHER ON THE DIGENTIA. Horatius Cogitabundus. 1. Favonius changes with sunny kisses The spring's ice-fetters to bands of flowers, And the delicate Graces, those thin-skinn'd Misses, Are beginning to dance with the rosy Hours; The Dryades, feeling the breeze on their bosoms, Thro' tuby branches are blowing out blossoms; The naked Naiad of every pool, Lest the sunshine should drive her to playing the fool, Lies full length in the water and keeps herself cool; Pan is piping afar, 'mid the trees, His ditty dies on the dying breeze, While a wood-nymph leaneth her head on his knees, In a dream, in a dream, with her wild eyes glistening, Her bosom throbbing, her whole soul listening! In fact, 'tis the season of billing and cooing, Amorous flying and fond pursuing, Kissing, and pressing, and mischief-doing; And pleasant it is to take one's tipple In the mild warm breath of the spicy South, And deftly to fasten one's lips to the mouth Of a flasket warmer than Venus' nipple! Pleasant, pleasant, at this the season When folly is reason and reason treason, When nought is so powerful near or far As the palpitating Titillating Twinkle, twinkle, of the Cyprian star! 2. But what has a shaky quaky fellow, Full of the sunshine but over-mellow, To do with the beautiful Lesbian Queen, The pink-eyed precious with locks of yellow, The goddess of twenty and sweet eighteen, Whose double conquest o'er Pride and Spleen In the Greek King's bed put a viper green And darken'd the seas with the Grecian force? Nothing, of course! Well, even I have of joy my measure And can welcome the newborn Adonis with pleasure; For since at Philippi, worst of scrapes, I saved my skin for the good of the nation, And made my pious asseveration To scorn ambition and cultivate grapes, I've found by a curious convolution Of physical ailments and heavenly stars, And of wisdom wean'd on the blood-milk of Mars, That my pluck is surpass'd by my elocution— And learnt, in fine, That rosy wine And sunshine agree with my constitution! (Bibit.) 3. Pleasant it is, I say, to sit here, Just in the sunshine without the threshold, And, with fond fingers and lips, caress old Bacchus' bottle, the source of wit, here! Drowsily hum the honey-bees, Drowsily murmur the birds in the trees, Drowsily drops the spicy breeze, Drowsily I sit at mine ease. 4. An idle life is the life for me,— Idleness spiced by philosophy! I care not a fig for the cares of business, Politics fill me with doubt and dizziness, Pomps and triumphs are simply a bore to me, Crude ambition will come no more to me, I hate the vulgar popular cattle, And I modestly blush at the mention of battle. No!—Here is my humble definition Of a perfectly happy and virtuous condition: A few fat acres aroundabout, To give one a sense of possession; a few Servants to pour the sweet Massic out; Plenty to eat and nothing to do; A feeling of cozy and proud virility; A few stray pence;— And the tiniest sense Of self-conserving responsibility! 5. For, what is Life?—or, rather ask here, What is that fountain of music and motion We call th Soul?—As I sit and bask here, I confess that I haven't the slightest notion Yet Plato calls it eternal, telling How its original lofty dwelling Was among the stars, till, fairly repining At eternally turning a pivot and shining, Heaven it quitted To dwell unpitied In a fleshly mansion of wining and whining; Aristotle, I don't know why, Believes that, born up above in the sky The moment that Body is born on the earth, 'Tis married to Body that moment of birth; Hippo and others, whose heads were a muddle, Affirm 'tis compounded of water—puddle! Fire, not a few, with Democritus, swear; While others—chameleons—reduce it to Air; Water and fire, cries Hippocrates! No, water and earth, cries Xenophanes! Earth and fire, cries Parmenides! Stop! cries Empedocles,—all of these! Ennius follow'd Pythagoras, thinking The transmigration of spirits a truth;— A doctrine I choose to apply in sooth To the spirit that lies in the wine I'm drinking; Speculation, muddle, trouble, Some see obliquely, others double, While under their noses, Which smell not the roses, Truth placidly bursts like a spangled bubble. 6. Altogether, they puzzle me quite, They all seem wrong and they all seem right. The puzzle remains an unsatisfied question; But Epicurus has flatly tried To prove that the soul is closely allied To wine, and sunshine, and good digestion. For without any prosing, head-racking, or preaching, That's the construction I put on his teaching! 'Tis simple: the Soul and the Body are one, Like the Sun itself and the light of the Sun, Born to change with all other creations, Homunculi, qualities, emanations, To pass thro' wondrous and strange gradations; And if this be the case, our best resource Is to make the most of our time, of course, Nor grumble and question till hoary and hoarse. And I slightly improve upon Epicurus, Who shirk'd good living, as some assure us, And assert, from experience long and rare, That body and soul can be perfectly snug, With sunshine, fresh air, And no physical care, In a garden that never requires to be dug. 7. I, Quintus Horatius Flaccus, am learning From the tuneful stars in my zenith turning, From my bachelorhood, which is wide awake, That the sum of good is a life of ease, A friend or two, if the humour please, And not a tie it would pain you to break. Call me selfish, indolent, vain, But I don't and won't see the virtue of pain, Be it of body or be it of brain; Philippi finish'd my education, For it taught me the doctrine of self-preservation. I hate the barking of Scylla's dogs, Round Charybdis your sailor may spin, but not I:— In short, I am one of those excellent hogs That grunt in the Grecian epicure's sty. Day by day, my delight has grown wider Since I learnt that wine is a natural good, And the stubborn donkey called Fortitude Has a knack of upsetting the bile of its rider. All creeds that vex one are mere vexation; But I firmly believe, and no man dare doubt me, In Massic taken in moderation, And I like to dwell where no fools can flout me— Sans physical care, In the sunny air, And to sing—when I feel the fresh world about me! (Bibit.) 8. Bear witness, Flower!—One's sense perceives The rich sap lying within your leaves, Which lusciously swoon to a soft blood-red As the sunlight woos them from overhead! Now, here is a parallel worth inspection Of body and blood in perfect connexion With what some call Soul, that obscure abstraction Which I have proved to my satisfaction To be Body in lesser or greater perfection. The perfect parts of the perfect flower Were nourish'd by sunshine for many an hour, Till the sunshine within them o'erflowing—hence The juice whose odorous quintessence, Though sweetly expressing the parts and the whole, Is simply a part of the whole, and still Inseparate from the general will. The Flower is the Body, the Scent is the Soul! See! I press a thorn in the milky stalk: The small thing droops o'er the garden walk, The soft leaves shiver, the sap runs dry, And never more will the flower's mild eye Drink the breath of the moon—it will linger, and die. But the scent of the flower, some would cry, is the sweeter; True, but the scent, every moment, grows less, And, further observing, they would confess, That the flower, as a flower, is the incompleter! Well, between my fingers I sharpl press The delicate leaves, and thro' every vein The perfect anatomy shrinks with pain, And the flower with its odorous quintessence Will never, 'tis clear, be perfection again. Bah! I pluck it, I pluck it, and cast it hence, As Death plucks humanity body and brain! But the odour has not yet flown, you cry, It sweetens the air, tho' the flower doth die! Of course; and the feelers and stem and leaves, And the sap and the odour it interweaves, No longer perfect and gastronomic, Are in common resolving themselves, one perceives, Back to first principles—say atomic; And whatever destination your fine Hard-headed philosophers choose to assign To the several parts, they are reft of their power, And, so far as concerns its true functions—to scent The soft air, and look fair—and its first sweet intent, 'Tis clear that the whole is no longer a Flower. 9. Take that bulky and truly delectable whole, The egotistic disciple of Bacchus, With small hare's-eyes and gray hairs on his poll, Myself—good Quintus Horatius Flaccus! There's a Body! There's a Soul! Many a year, over Rome's dominions, Has he vaunted his Epicurean opinions: He may be wrong, he may be right, So he roars his creed in no mad heroics,— Since down in the grave, where all creeds unite Even Epicureans are changed to Stoics. (Bibit.) 10. Humph, the grave!—not the pleasantest prospect, affirms This quiet old heart starting up with a beat— Well, 'tis rather hard that liquor so sweet Goes simply to flavour a meal for worms! After all, I'm a sensible man, To render my span As happy and easeful as ever I can. To-morrow may mingle, who knows, who knows, The Life that is Dream with the Death that is Sleep, And the grass that covers my last repose May make a sward where the lambkins leap Round a mild-eyed mellifluous musical boy Who pipes to his flock in a pastoral joy, While the sun that is shining upon him there Draws silver threads thro' his curly hair, And Time with long shadows stalks past the spot, And the Hours pass by, and he sees them not! Instead of moping and idly rueing it, Now, this is the pleasantest way of viewing it!— To think, when all is over and done, Of insensately feeling one's way to the sun, Of being a part of the verdure that chases The mild west-wind into shady places, While one's liver, warming the roots of a tree, Creeps upward and flutters delectably In the leaves that tremble and sigh and sing, And the breath bubbles up in a daisy ring, And the heart, mingling strangely with rains and snows, Bleeds up thro' the turf in the blood of a rose. 11. Which reminds me, here, that the simile drawn From the flower that is withering on the lawn, May, by a stretch of the thought, apply To the universe—ocean, earth, air, and sky; And dividing the whole into infinite less, First principles, atomies numberless, We find that the sum of the universe strange Suffers continual mystical change; While the parts of the whole, tho' their compounds range Thro' all combinations from men down to daisies, Are eternal, unchangeable, suffer no phases. So that Death, to the dullest of heads so unsightly, Is (here I improve Epicurus slightly) Is but the period of dissolution Into some untraceable constitution Of the several parts of the Body and Soul,— And the total extinction of Man as a whole. As to Time—mere abstraction! With even motion Like waves that gathering foamy speech Grow duskily up on a moonlit beach, And seem to increase the huge bulk of the ocean, Hours roll upon hours in the measureless sea Of eternity: Never ceasing, they seem increasing; But the parts of the Infinite, changing never, Increase not, tho changing, the Whole, the For Ever. Time? Call it a compound, if you please, A divisible drop in eternal seas, An abstract figure, by which we men Try to count our sensations again and again, And then you will know, perceiving we must Nourish some compound with dust of dust, And seeing how short our sensations and powers, Why I am one, Who sits in the sun, Whose Time is no limited number of hours, But wine ever-present, in nectarine showers. 12. O Mutability, dread abstraction, Let me be wise in the satisfaction Of my moderate needs in a half-inaction! While Propertius grows love-sick and weary and wan, While thou, Virgil, singest of arms and the man, While assassins on Cæsar sharpen their eyes, While Agrippa stands grimly on blood-stained decks, While Mæcenas flirts with the female sex, Teach me to sport and philosophize! O Mutability, lasting ever, Changing ever, yet changing never, Teach me, O teach me, and make me wise!— In the dreadful depth of thy eyeballs dumb, Strange meanings flutter and pass to nought, And beautiful images fade as they come, Thro' an under-trouble of shady thought! 13. Yonder, yonder, the River doth run, From sun to shade, and from shade to sun, Shaking the lilies to seed as it flows, Under the willow-trees taking a doze, And waking up in a flutter of fun! Could you look at the leaves of yonder tree! The wind is stirring them as the sun is stirring me! The woolly clouds move quiet and slow, In the pale blue calm of the tranquil skies, And their shades that run on the grass below Leave purple dreams in the violet's eyes! The vine droops over my head with bright Clusters of purple and green—the rose Breaks her heart on the air—and the orange glows Like golden lamps in an emerald night. Golden lamps in a green night. —Andrew Marvel. While I sit, with the stain of the wine on my lip, Shall nature and I part fellowship? No, by Bacchus! This view from the threshold of home Is as glad to the core, and as sorrow-despising, As Aphrodite when fresh from the foam That still on her bosom was falling and rising, While the sunshine crept thro' her briny hair And mingled itself with the shadows there, And her deepening eyes drank their azure from air, And she blush'd a new beauty surpassingly fair! 14. 'Tis absurd to tell me to ruffle a feather, Because there may soon be a change of weather. When the Dog-Star foams, I will lie in the shade, And watch the white sun thro' an emerald glade; When winter murmurs with rain and storm, I will watch my hearth smile to itself, and keep warm; And for Death, who having fulfilled his task Leaves his deputy Silence in houses of mourning,— Well, I hope he no troublesome questions will ask, But knock me down, like an ox, without warning. Like the world, I most solemnly promise devotion To pleasure commingled of light, music, motion. I like (as I said) to sit here in my mirth, To be part of the joy of the sweet-smelling earth, To feel the blood blush like a flower with its glee, To sing like a bird, to be stirr'd like a tree, Drowsily, drowsily, sit at mine ease, While the odd rhymes buzz in my brain like bees, And over my wine-cup to chirp and to nod, Ay to sit—till I fall Like that peach from the wall— Self-sufficient, serene, happy-eyed,—like a God! (Bibit.) 15. Ay, crop the corn with the crooked sickle, Sow harvest early and reap too late, Prove Fortune friendly or false or fickle, Blunder and bother with aching pate, Attempting to conquer chance or fate, Struggle, speculate, dig, and bleed, Reap the whirlwind of Venus' seed, O senseless, impotent human breed! What avails! what avails! Were ye less intent On your raking and digging, perchance ye'd behold The fleecy vapours above you roll'd Round the dozing Deities dead to strife, With their mild great eyes on each other bent Enchanging a wisdom indifferent To the native honours of death and life. Sober truths of a pleasure divine Keep them supine! The grand lazy fellows have nothing to do With the hubble and trouble of me or of you, The stars break around them in silver foam, And they calmly amuse themselves, sometimes, by stealing A peep at us pigmies, with much the same feeling With which, from the candour and quiet of home, I glance at the strife of political Rome. Serene, happy-eyed, self-sufficient, they rest On the hill where the blue sky is leaning her breast:— Jove seated supreme in the midst, at his side Apollo the Sun and Selene the Moon, Juno half dozing, her foot of pride On the neck of Venus the drowsy-eyed, And Pallas humming the spheric tune. 16. Flash! Lightning, I swear!—there's a tempest brewing! Crash! Thunder, too—swift-footed lightning pursuing! The leaves are troubled, the winds drop dead, The air grows ruminant overhead— Splash! That great round drop fell pat on my nose. Flash! crash! splash!— I must run for it, I suppose. O what a flashing and crashing and splashing, The earth is rocking, the skies are riven— Jove in a passion, in god-like fashion, Is breaking the crystal urns of heaven. XVIII. FINE WEATHER BY BAIAE. Virgil to Horace. 1 Sweet is soft slumber, Horace, after toil, To him who holds the glebe and ploughs the fruitful soil, Sweet to salt-blooded mariners, on decks washed red with storm, Deep sleep wherein past tempest and green waves Make shadows multiform; 2 Sweet 'tis to Cæsar, when the red star, grown Swart with war's dust, doth fade, to loll upon a throne Dispensing gifts, while on his lips a crafty half-smile dies, And the soft whispers of approving Rome Fan his half-closëd eyes! 3 Sweet to Tibullus, sick and out of tune, What time his elegies like wolves howl at the moon, Comes Pity loos'ning Delia's zone as breezes part a cloud; And sweet to thee a wine-cup rough with sleep, After the tawny crowd. 4 And further, sweetly comes a scroll from thee, To Virgil where he dwells at Baiae near the sea— For, sick with servile snakes of state that twine round Cæsar's foot, He welcomes thy moist greeting and thy thought Poetically put. 5 Such alternation of unrest and rest, All fitful peace and passion of the yearning breast, Deepen the meanings flashing swift in Joy's pink-lidded eyne, And help the Hours to juggle with the fruits Of easy creeds like thine. 6 The time-glass runs, the seasons come and go, After the rain, the flowers, after the flowers, the snow; This Hour is pale and olive-crown'd, that splash'd with rebel-mud— This, flusht to gaze on Cæsar's laurell'd brows, That, drunk with Cæsar's blood! 7 Shall merest mortal man with drowsy nod Sit under purple vine and doze and ape the god? Wave down the everlasting strife of earth and air and sea? And, like a full-fed fruit that gorges light, Grow rotten on the tree? 8 Leave the grand mental war that mortals keep? Eat the fat ears of corn, yet neither sow nor reap? Loll in the sunshine, sipping sweets, what time the din of fights Quenches the wind round Troy, and very gods Feel dizzy on their heights? 9 Nay, friend!—For such a man each hour supplies Portents that mock his ease, affright his languid eyes: The very elements are leagued to goad him blood and brain, The very Sun sows drouth within his throat Until it raves for rain! 10 Methinks I see thee sitting in the sun, Whose kisses melt thy crusty wrinkles one by one: Thy lips droop darkly with a worm of thought, half sad, half wroth, Which stirs the chrysalis mouth, then, ripe with wine, Bursts like a golden moth. 11 Unfaith is with thee, Horace. Sun and wind Disturb the tranquil currents of thy heart and mind; In midst of Joy, comes pigmy doubt, prick-pricking like a flea, Till, wide awake, you rack your brains to prove Your perfect bliss to me. 12 O better far, if Man would climb, to range Thro' sun and thunder-storm tempestuous paths of change, To mingle with the motion huge of earth and air and main, And lastly, fall upon a bed of flowers When wearied down by pain. 13 Deep, deep, within Man's elemental parts— Earth, water, fire, and air that mix in human hearts,— Subsists Unrest that seeketh Rest, and flashes into gleams That haunt the soul to action, and by night Disturb our sleep with dreams. 14 And thus we fashion with a piteous will The gods in drowsy mildness seated on a hill, The day before them evermore, the starry night behind,— Inheritors of the divine repose We seek and cannot find. 15 Woe, woe, to him, who craving that calm boon Falleth to sleep on beds of poppy flowers too soon! The elements shall hem him in and fright his shrieking soul, And, since he asks for light, Lightning itself Shall scorch his eyes to coal! 16 My Horace!—I am here beside the deep, Weaving at will this verse for Memory to keep: I share the sunshine with my friend, and like a lizard bask; But I, friend, doubt this summer joy,—and you Shall answer what I ask.— 17 Bluff March has blown his clarion out of tune, Gone is the blue-edged sickle of the April moon; Faded hath fretful May behind a tremulous veil of rain,— But I would the boisterous season of the winds And snows were here again! 18 For I am kneeling on the white sea-sand, Letting the cold soft waves creep up and kiss my hand; A golden glare of sunshine fills the blue air at my back, And swims between the meadows and the skies, Leaving the meadows black. 19 All is as still and beautiful as sleep: Nay, all is sleep—the quiet air, the azure deep; The cool blue waves creep thro' my fingers with a silver gleam, As, lost in utter calm, I neither think Nor act, but only dream. 20 This is the poetry of Heart's repose, For which my spirit yearn'd thro' drifting winds and snows— Only the tingling coolness on my hand seems part akin To that bleak winter warring when the dream Of peace arose within. 21 What time I dream'd of this, the winds, cast free, Swoop'd eagle-like and tore the white bowels of the sea; The winter tempest moved above, and storm on storm did frown;— I saw the awful Sea bound up in cloud And then torn hugely down. 22 Within my blood arose the wild commotion, My soul was battling abroad with winds and ocean; But in the centre of the wrath, all nature, sea and sky, Call'd out aloud for peace divine as this, And lo, I join'd the cry. 23 And calm has come, and June is on the deep, The winds are nested, and the earth takes mellow sleep; Yet, friend, my soul, though husht in awe, feels peace so still is pain,— And the monotonous yearning voice within Calls out for war again! 24 For hark! into my dream of golden ease Breaketh the hollow murmur of untroubled seas; And behold, my blood awakens with a thrill and sinks and swells, As when low breezes die and rise again On beds of asphodels. 25 Ay, now, when all is placid as a star, My soul in incompleteness longs for active war; Amid its utter happiness, it sighs imperfectly In answer to the beautiful unrest Within the sleeping sea. 26 Unsatisfied, I hunger on the land, Only subdued by this bright water on my hand; The beating heart within my breast for louder utterance yearns— I listen, and the sympathetic sea Its endless moan returns. 27 Quiet, monotonous, breathless, almost drown'd, Inaudibly audible, felt scarce heard, cometh the sound, Monotonous, so monotonous, but oh! so sweet, so sweet, When my hid heart is throbbing forth a voice, And the two voices meet. 28 The void within the calm for which I yearned, Until this moment was imperfectly discerned; But now I feel to the roots of life an inner melody, That harmonises my unquiet heart With the unquiet sea. 29 Hear I the crawling movements of the main? Or hear I dim heart-echoes dying in the brain? Is there but one impatient moan, and is it of the sea? And, if two voices speak, which voice belongs To ocean, which to me? 30 The sounds have mingled into some faint whole, Inseparate, trembling o'er the fibres of my soul; And the cool waves have a magic all my swooning blood to quell; The sea glides thro' and thro' me, and my soul Keeps sea-sound like a shell. 31 Ah, the monotonous music in my soul, Enlarging like the waves, murmuring without control!— Is it that changeful nature can rest not night nor day? And is the music born of this lorn Man, Or Ocean,—Horace, say? 32 Is there a climbing element in life Which is at war with rest, alternates strife with strife, Whereby we reach eternal seas upon whose shores unstirr'd Ev'n Joy can sleep,—because no moan like this Within those waves is heard? XIX. THE SWAN-SONG OF APOLLO. 1 O Lyre! O Lyre! Strung with celestial fire! Thou living soul of sound that answereth These fingers that have troubled thee so long, With passion, and with music, and with breath Of melancholy song,— Answer, answer, answer me, With thy withering melody! For the earth is old and strange Mysteries are working change, And the Dead who slumber'd deep Startle troubled from their sleep, And the ancient gods divine, Pale and haggard o'er their wine, Fade in their ghastly banquet-halls, with large eyes fixed on mine! 2 Ah me! ah me! The earth and air and sea Are shaken; and the great pale gods sit still, The roseate mists around them roll away:— Lo! Hebe listens in the act to fill, And groweth wan and gray; On the banquet-table spread, Fruits and flowers grow sick and dead, Nectar cold in every cup Gleams to blood and withers up; Aphrodité breathes a charm, Gripping Pallas' bronzëd arm; Zeus the Father clenches teeth, While his cloud-throne shakes beneath; The passion-flower in Heré's hair melts in a snowy wreath! 3 Ah, woe! ah, woe! One climbeth from below,— A mortal shape with pallid smile divine, Bearing a heavy Cross and crown'd with thorn,— His brow is moist with blood, his strange sweet eyne Look piteous and forlorn: Hark, O hark! his cold foot-fall Breaks upon the banquet-hall! God and goddess start to hear, Earth, air, ocean, moan in fear; Shadows of the Cross and Him Dark the banquet-table dim, Silent sit the gods divine, Old and haggard over wine, And slowly to thy song they fade, with large eyes fixed on mine! 4 O Lyre! O Lyre! Thy strings of golden fire Fade to their fading, and the hand is chill That touches thee; the great bright brow grows gray— I faint, I wither, while that conclave still Dies wearily away! Ah, the prophecy of old Sung by us to smilers cold!— God and goddess droop and die, Chilly cold against the sky, There is change and all is done, Strange look moon and stars and sun! God and goddess fade, and see! All their large eyes look at me! While woe! ah, woe! in dying song, I fade, I fade, with thee! POET'S EPILOGUE. TO MARY ON EARTH. ‘Simplex munditiis.’ 1. So! now the task is ended; and to-night, Sick, impotent, no longer soul-sustain'd, Withdrawing eyes from that ideal height Where, in low undertones, those Spirits plain'd, Each full of special glory unattain'd,— I turn on you, Sweet-Heart, my weary sight.— Shut out the darkness, shutting in the light: So! now the task is ended. What is gain'd? 2. First, sit beside me. Place your hand in mine. From deepest fountain of your veins the while Call up your Soul; and briefly let it shine In those gray eyes with mildness feminine. Yes, smile, Dear!—you are truest when you smile. 3. My heart to-night is calm as peaceful dreams.— Afar away the wind is shrill, the culver Blows up and down the moors with windy gleams, The birch unlooseneth her locks of silver And shakes them softly on the mountain streams, And o'er the grave that holds my David's dust The Moon uplifts her empty dripping horn: Thither my fancies turn, but turn in trust, Not wholly sadly, faithful though forlorn. For you, too, ove him, mourn his life's quick fleeting; We think of him in common. Is it so?— Your little hand has answer'd, and I know His name makes music in your heart's soft beating; And—well, 'tis something gain'd for him and me— Him, in his heaven, and me, in this low spot, Something his eyes will see, and joy to see— That you, too, love him, though you knew him not. 4. Yet this is bitter. We were boy and boy, Hand link'd in hand we dreamt of power and fame, We shared each other's sorrow, pride, and joy, To one wild tune our swift blood went and came, Eyes drank each other's hope with flash of flame. Then, side by side, we clomb the hill of life, We ranged thro' mist and mist, thro' storm and strife; But then,—it is so bitter, now, to feel That his pale Soul to mine was so akin, Firm-fix'd on goals we each set forth to win, So twinly conscious of the sweet Ideal, So wedded (God forgive me if I sin!) That neither he, my friend, nor I could steal One glimpse of heaven's divinities—alone, And flushing seek his brother, and reveal Some hope, some joy, some beauty, else unknown; Nor, bringing down his sunlight from the Sun, Call sudden up, to light his fellow's face, A smile as proud, as glad, as that I trace In your dear eyes, now, when my work is done. 5. Love gains in giving. What had I to give Whereof his Poet-Soul was not possest? What gleams of stars he knew not, fugitive As lightning-flashes, could I manifest? What music fainting from a clearer air? What lights of sunrise from beyond the grave? What pride in knowledge that he could not share?— Ay, Mary, it is bitter; for I swear He took with him, to heav'n, no wealth I gave. 6. No, Love, it is not bitter! Thoughts like those Were sin these songs I sing you must adjust. Not bitter, ah, not bitter!—God is just; And, seeing our one-knowledge, just God chose, By one swift stroke, to part us. Far above The measure of my hope, my pride, my love, Above our seasons, suns and rains and snows,— He, like an exhalation, thus arose; Hearing in a diviner atmosphere Music we only see, when, dewy and dim, The stars thro' gulfs of azure darkness swim, Music we seem to see, but cannot hear. But evermore, my Poet, on his height, Fills up my Soul with sweetness to the brim, Rains influence, and warning, and delight; And now, I smile for pride and joy in him! 7. I said, Love gains by giving. And to know That I, who could not glorify my Friend, Soul of my Soul, although I loved him so, Have power and strength and privilege to lend Glimpses of heav'n to Thee, of hope, of bliss! Power to go heavenward, pluck flowers and blend Their hues in wreaths I give you with a kiss— You, Love, who climb not up the heights at all! To think, to think, I never could upcall On his dead face, so proud a smile as this! 8. Most just is God: who bids me not be sad For his dear sake whose name is dear to thee, Who bids me proudly climb and sometimes see With joy a glimpse of him in glory clad, Who, further, bids your life be proud and glad, When I have climb'd and seen, for joy in me. My lowly-minded, gentle-hearted Love! I bring you down his gifts, and am sustain'd: You watch and pray—I climb—he stands above. So, now the task is ended, what is gain'd? 9. This knowledge.—Better in your arms to rest, Better to love you till my heart should break, Than pause to ask if he who would be blest Should love for more than his own loving's sake. So closer, closer still; for (while afar, Mile upon mile toward the polar star, Now in the autumn time our Poet's dust Sucks back thro' grassy sods the flowers it thrust To feel the summer on the outer earth) I turn to you, and on your bosom fall. Love grows by giving. I have given my all. So, smile—to show you hold the gift of worth. 10. Ay, all the thanks that I on earth can render To him who sends me such good news from God, Is, in due turn, to thy young life to tender Hopes that denote, while blossoming in splendour, Where an invisible Angel's foot hath trode. So, Sweet-Heart, I have given unto thee, Not only such poor song as here I twine, But Hope, Ambition, all of mine or me, My flesh and blood, and more, my soul divine. Take all, take all! Ay, wind white arms about My neck and from my breath draw bliss for thine: Smile, Sweet-Heart, and be happy—lest thou doubt How much the gift I give thee makes thee mine! Idyls and Legends of Inverburn. (1865.) [Fly to the city, Spirit of the Spring] Fly to the city, Spirit of the Spring, Breathe softly on the eyes of those who read, And make a gentle picture of the scene Wherein these menland women come and go: The clachan with its humming sound of looms, The quaint old gables, roofs of turf and thatch, The glimmeringlspire that peeps above the firs, The stream whose soft blue arms encircle all,— And in the background heathery norland hills, Hued like the azure of the dew-berrie, And mingling with the regions of the rain! THE LOWLAND VILLAGE. Seven pleasant miles by wood, and stream, and moor, Seven miles along the country road that wound Uphill and downhill in a dusty line, Then from the forehead of a hill, behold— Lying below me, sparkling ruby-like— The village!—quaint old gables, roofs of thatch, The glimmering spire that peep'd above the firs, The sunset lingering orange-red on all, And nearer, tumbling thro' a mossy bridge, The river that I knew! No wondrous peep Into the faëry land of Oberon, Its bowers, its glowworm-lighted colonnades Where pigmy lovers wander two by two, Could weigh upon the city wanderer's heart With peace so pure as this! Why, yonder stood, A fledgling's downward flight beyond the spire, The gray old manse, endear'd by memories Of Jean the daughter of the minister; And in the cottage with the painted sign, Hard by the bridge, how many a winter night Had I with politicians sapient-eyed Discuss'd the county paper's latest news And read of toppling thrones!—And nought seem'd changed! The very gig before the smithy door, The barefoot maiden with the milking pail Pausing and looking backward from the bridge, The last rook wavering homeward to the wood, All seem'd a sunset-picture, every tint Unchanged, since I had bidden it farewell. My heart grew garrulous of olden times, And my face sadden'd, as I saunter'd down. Then came a rural music on my ears,— The waggons in the lanes, the waterfall With cool sound plunging in its wood-nest wild, The rooks amid the windy rookery, The shouts of children, and more far away The crowing of a cock. Then o'er the bridge I bent, above the river gushing down Thro' mossy boulders, making underneath Green-shaded pools where now and then a trout Sank in the ripple of its own quick leap; And like some olden and familiar tune, Half humm'd aloud, half tinkling in the brain, Troublously, faintly, came the buzz of looms. And here I linger'd, nested in the shade Of Peace that makes a music as she grows; And when the vale had put its glory on The bitter aspiration was subdued, And Pleasure, tho' she wore a woodland crown, Look'd at me with Ambition's serious eyes. Amid the deep green woods of pine, whose boughs Made a sea-music overhead, and caught White flakes of sunlight on their highest leaves, I foster'd solemn meditations; Stretch'd on the sloping river banks, fresh strewn With speedwell, primrose, and anemone, I watch'd the bright king-fisher dart about, His quick small shadow with an azure gleam Startling the minnows in the pool beneath; Or later on the moors, where far away Across the waste the sportsman with his gun Stood a dark speck across the azure, while The heath-hen tower'd with beating wings and fell, I caught the solemn wind that wander'd down With thunder-echoes heaved among the hills. Nor lack'd I, in the balmy summer nights, Or on the days of rain, such counterpoise As books can give. The honey-languaged Greek Who gently piped the sweet bucolic lay, The wit who raved of Lesbia's loosen'd zone And loved divinely what was less than earth, Were with me; others, of a later date: The eagle-eyed comedian divine; The English Homer, not the humpback'd one Who sung Belinda's curl at Twickenham, But Chapman, master of the long strong line; Moreover, those few singers who have lit The beacon-lights of these our latter days— Chief, young Hyperion, who setting soon Sent his pale look along the future time, And the tall figure on the hills, that stoopt To see the daisy's shadow on the grass. WILLIE BAIRD. ‘An old man's tale, a tale for men gray-hair'd, Who wear, thro’ second childhood, to the Lord. 'Tis two-and-thirty summers since I came To school the village lads of Inverburn. My father was a shepherd old and poor, Who, dwelling 'mong the clouds on norland hills, His tartan plaidie on, and by his side His sheep-dog running, redden'd with the winds That whistle southward from the Polar seas: I follow'd in his footsteps when a boy, And knew by heart the mountains round our home; But when I went to Edinglass, to learn At college there, I look'd about the place, And heard the murmur of the busy streets Around me, in a dream;—and only saw The clouds that snow around the mountain-tops, The mists that chase the phantom of the moon In lonely mountain tarns,—and heard the while, Not footsteps sounding hollow to and fro, But winds sough-soughing thro' the woods of pine. Time pass'd; and day by day those sights and sounds Grew fainter,—till they troubled me no more. O Willie, Willie, are you sleeping sound? And can you feel the stone that I have placed Yonder above you? Are you dead, my doo? Or did you see the shining Hand that parts The clouds above, and becks the bonnie birds, Until they wing away, and human eyes, That watch them till they vanish in the blue, Droop and grow tearful? Ay, I ken, I ken, I'm talking folly, but I loved the child! He was the bravest scholar in the school! He came to teach the very dominie— Me, with my lyart locks and sleepy heart! O weel I mind the day his mother brought Her tiny trembling tot with yellow hair, Her tiny poor-clad tot six summers old, And left him seated lonely on a form Before my desk. He neither wept nor gloom'd; But waited silently, with shoeless feet Swinging above the floor; in wonder eyed The maps upon the walls, the big black board, The slates and books and copies, and my own Grey hose and clumpy boots; last, fixing gaze Upon a monster spider's web that fill'd One corner of the whitewash'd ceiling, watch'd The speckled traitor jump and jink about, Till he forgot my unfamiliar eyes, Weary and strange and old. ‘Come here, my bairn!’ And timid as a lamb he seedled up. ‘What do they call ye?’ ‘Willie,’ coo'd the wean, Up-peeping slyly, scraping with his feet. I put my hand upon his yellow hair, And cheer'd him kindly. Then I bade him lift The small black bell that stands behind the door And ring the shouting laddies from their play. ‘Run, Willie!’ And he ran, and eyed the bell, Stoop'd o'er it, seem'd afraid that it would bite, Then grasp'd it firm, and as it jingled gave A timid cry—next laugh'd to hear the sound— And ran full merry to the door and rang, And rang, and rang, while lights of music lit His pallid cheek, till, shouting, panting hard, In ran the big rough laddies from their play. Then rapping sharply on the desk I drove The laddies to their seats, and beckon'd up The stranger—smiling, bade him seat himself And hearken to the rest. Two weary hours Buzz-buzz, boom-boom, went on the noise of school, While Willie sat and listen'd open-mouthed; Till school was over, and the big and small Flew home in flocks. But Willie stay'd behind. I beckon'd to the mannock with a smile, And took him on my knee and crack'd and talk'd. First, he was timid; next, grew bashful; next, He warm'd and told me stories of his home His father, mother, sisters, brothers, all; And how, when strong and big, he meant to buy A gig to drive his father to the kirk; And how he long'd to be a dominie: Such simple prattle as I plainly see You smile at. But to little children God Has given wisdom and mysterious power Which beat the mathematics. Quærere Verum in sylvis Academi, Sir, Is meet for men who can afford to dwell For ever in a garden, reading books Of morals and the logic. Good and weel! Give me such tiny truths as only bloom Like red-tipt gowans at the hallanstone, Or kindle softly, flashing bright at times, In fuffing cottage fires! The laddie still Was seated on my knee, when at the door We heard a sound of scraping: Willie prick'd His ears and listened, then he clapt his hands— ‘Hey! Donald, Donald, Donald!’ [See! the rogue Looks up and blinks his eyes—he kens his name!] ‘Hey, Donald, Donald!’ Willie cried. At that I saw beneath me, at the door, a Dog— The very collie dozing at your feet, His nose between his paws, his eyes half closed. At sight of Willie, with a joyful bark He leapt and gamboll'd, eying me the while In queer suspicion; and the mannock peep'd Into my face, while patting Donald's back— ‘It's Donald! he has come to take me home!’ An old man's tale, a tale for men gray-hair'd, Who wear, thro' second childhood to the grave! I'll hasten on. Thenceforward Willie came Daily to school, and daily to the door Came Donald trotting; and they homeward went Together—Willie walking slow but sure, And Donald trotting sagely by his side. [Ay, Donald, he is dead! be still, old man!] What link existed, human or divine, Between the tiny tot six summers old, And yonder life of mine upon the hills Among the mists and storms? 'Tis strange, 'tis strange! But when I look'd on Willie's face, it seem'd That I had known it in some beauteous life That I had left behind me in the north. This fancy grew and grew, till oft I sat— The buzzing school around me—and would seem To be among the mists, the tracks of rain, Nearing the awful silence of the snow. Slowly and surely I began to feel That I was all alone in all the world, And that my mother and my father slept Far, far away in some forgotten kirk— Remember'd but in dreams. Alone at nights, I read my Bible more and Euclid less. For, mind you, like my betters, I had been Half scoffer, half believer; on the whole, I thought the life beyond a useless dream, Best left alone, and shut my eyes to themes That puzzled mathematics. But at last, When Willie Baird and I grew friends, and thoughts Came to me from beyond my father's grave, I found 'twas pleasant late at e'en to read My Bible—haply, only just to pick Some easy chapter for my pet to learn— Yet night by night my soul was guided on Like a blind man some angel hand convoys. I cannot frame in speech the thoughts that fill'd This gray old brow, the feelings dim and warm That soothed the throbbings of this weary heart! But when I placed my hand on Willie's head, Warm sunshine tingled from the yellow hair Thro' trembling fingers to my blood within; And when I look'd in Willie's stainless eyes I saw the empty other floating gray O'er shadowy mountains murmuring low with winds! And often when, in his old-fashion'd way, He question'd me, I seem'd to hear a voice From far away, that mingled with the cries Haunting the regions where the round red sun Is all alone with God among the snow! Who made the stars? and if within his hand He caught and held one, would his fingers burn! If I, the gray-hair'd dominie, was dug From out a cabbage garden such as he Was found in? if, when bigger, he would wear Gray homespun hose and clumsy boots like mine, And have a house to dwell in all alone? Thus would he question, seated on my knee, While Donald (wheesht, old man!) stretch'd lyart limbs Under my chair, contented. Open-mouth'd He hearken'd to the tales I loved to tell About Sir William Wallace and the Bruce, And the sweet lady on the Scottish throne, Whose crown was colder than a band of ice, Yet seem'd a sunny crown whene'er she smiled; With many tales of genii, giants, dwarfs, And little folk that play at jing-a-ring On beds of harebells 'neath the silver moon; Stories and rhymes and songs of Wonderland: How Tammas Ercildoune in Elfland dwelt, How Galloway's mermaid comb'd her golden hair, How Tammas Thumb stuck in the spider's web, And fought and fought, a needle for his sword, Dyeing his weapon in the crimson blood Of the foul traitor with the poison'd fangs! And when we read the Holy Book, the child Would think and think o'er parts he loved the best; The draught of fish, the Child that sat so wise In the great Temple, Herod's cruel law To slay the bairns, or—oftenest of all— The crucifixion of the Good Kind Man Who loved the weans and was a wean himself. He speir'd of Death! and were the sleepers cold Down in the dark wet earth? and was it God That put the grass and flowers in the kirkyard? What kind of dwelling-place was heaven above? And was it full of flowers? and were there schools And dominies there? and was it far away? Then, with a look that made your eyes grow dim, Clasping his wee white hands round Donald's neck, ‘Do doggies gang to heaven?’ he would ask; ‘Would Donald gang?’ and keek'd in Donald's face, While Donald blink'd with meditative gaze, As if he knew full brawly what we said, And ponder'd o'er it, wiser far than we! But how I answer'd, how explain'd these themes I know not. Oft I could not speak at all. Yet every question made me think of things Forgotten, puzzled so, and when I strove To reason puzzled me so much the more, That, flinging logic to the winds, I went Straight onward to the mark in Willie's way. Took most for granted, laid down premises Of Faith, imagined, gave my wit the reins, And oft on nights at e'en, to my surprise, Felt palpably an angel's glowing face Glimmering down upon me, while mine eyes Dimm'd their old orbs with tears that came unbid To bear the glory of the light they saw! So summer pass'd. Yon chestnut at the door Scatter'd its burnish'd leaves and made a sound Of wind among its branches. Every day Came Willie, seldom going home again Till near the sunset: wet or dry he came: Oft in the rainy weather carrying A big umbrella, under which he walk'd— A little fairy in a parachute Blown hither, thither, at the wind's wild will. Pleased was my heart to see his pallid cheeks Were gathering rosy-posies, that his eyes Were softer and less sad. Then, with a gust, Old Winter tumbled shrieking from the hills, His white hair blowing in the wind. The house Where Willie's mother lives is scarce a mile From yonder hallan, if you take a cut Before you reach the village, crossing o'er Green meadows till you reach the road again; But he who thither goes along the road Loses a reaper's mile. The summer long Wee Willie came and went across the fields: He loved the smell of flowers and grass, the sight Of cows and sheep, the changing stalks of wheat, And he was weak and small. When winter came, Still caring not a straw for wind or rain Came Willie and the collie; till by night Down fell the snow, and fell three nights and days, Then ceased. The ground was white and ankle-deep; The window of the school was threaded o'er With flowers of hueless ice—Frost's unseen hands Prick'd you from head to foot with tingling heat. The shouting urchins, yonder on the green, Play'd snowballs. In the school a cheery fire Was kindled every day, and every day When Willie came he had the warmest seat, And every day old Donald, punctual, came To join us, after labour, in the lowe. Three days and nights the snow had mistily fall'n. It lay long miles along the country-side, White, awful, silent. In the keen cold air There was a hush, a sleepless silentness, And mid it all, upraising eyes, you felt God's breath upon your face; and in your blood, Though you were cold to touch, was flaming fire, Such as within the bowels of the earth Burnt at the bones of ice, and wreath'd them round With grass ungrown. One day in school I saw, Through threaded window-panes, soft snowy flakes Fall with unquiet motion, mistily, slowly, At intervals; but when the boys were gone, And in ran Donald with a dripping nose, The air was clear and gray as glass. An hour Sat Willie, Donald, and myself around The murmuring fire, and then with tender hand I wrapt a comforter round Willie's throat, Button'd his coat around him close and warm, And off he ran with Donald, happy-eyed And merry, leaving fairy prints of feet Behind him on the snow. I watch'd them fade Round the white curve, and, turning with a sigh, Came in to sort the room and smoke a pipe Before the fire. Here, dreaming all alone, I sat and smoked, and in the fire saw clear The norland mountains, white and cold with snow That crumbled silently, and moved, and changed,— When suddenly the air grew sick and dark, And from the distance came a hollow sound, A murmur like the moan of far-off seas. I started to my feet, look'd out, and knew The winter wind was whistling from the clouds To lash the snow-clothed plain, and to myself I prophesied a storm before the night. Then with an icy pain, an eldritch fear, I thought of Willie; but I cheer'd my heart, ‘He's nome, and with his mother, long ere this!’ While thus I stood the hollow murmur grew Deeper, the wold grew darker, and the snow Rush'd downward, whirling in a shadowy mist. I walk'd to yonder door and open'd it. Whirr! the wind swung it from me with a clang, And in upon me with an iron-like crash Swoop'd in the drift! With pinch'd sharp face I gazed Out on the storm! Dark, dark, was all! A mist, A blinding, whirling mist, of chilly snow, The falling and the driven; for the wind Swept round and round in clouds upon the earth, And birm'd the deathly drift aloft with moans, Till all was dreadful darkness. Far above A voice was shrieking, like a human cry! I closed the door, and turn'd me to the fire, With something on my heart—a load—a sense Of an impending pain. Down the broad lum Came melting flakes that hiss'd upon the coal; Under my eyelids blew the blinding smoke, And for a time I sat like one bewitch'd, Still as a stone. The lonely room grew dark, The flickering fire threw phantoms of the snow Along the floor and on the walls around The melancholy ticking of the clock Was like the beating of my heart. But, hush! Above the moaning of the wind I heard A sudden scraping at the door; my heart Stood still and listen'd; and with that there rose An awsome howl, shrill as a dying screech, And scrape-scrape-scrape, the sound beyond the door! I could not think—I could not breathe—a dark, Awful foreboding gript me like a hand, As opening the door I gazed straight out, Saw nothing, till I felt against my knees Something that moved and heard a moaning sound— Then, panting, moaning, o'er the threshold leapt Donald the dog, alone, and white with snow. Down, Donald! down, old man! Sir, look at him! I swear he knows the meaning of my words, And tho' he cannot speak, his heart is full! See now! see now! he puts his cold black nose Into my palm and whines! he knows, he knows! Would speak, and cannot, but he minds that night! The terror of my heart seem'd choking me. Dumbly I stared and wildly at the dog, Who gazed into my face and whined and moan'd, Leap'd at the door, then touched me with his paws, And lastly, gript my coat between his teeth, And pull'd and pull'd—whiles growling, whining whiles— Till fairly madden'd, in bewilder'd fear, I let him drag me through the banging door Out to the whirling storm. Bareheaded, wild, The wind and snow-drift beating on my face Blowing me hither, thither, with the dog, I dash'd along the road. What follow'd seem'd An eerie, eerie dream!—a world of snow, A sky of wind, a whirling howling mist Which swam around with hundred sickly eyes; And Donald dragging, dragging, beaten, bruised, Leading me on to something that I fear'd— An awful something, and I knew not what! On, on, and farther on, and still the snow Whirling, the tempest moaning! Then I mind Of groping blindly in the shadowy light, And Donald by me burrowing with his nose And whining. Next a darkness, blank and deep! But then I mind of tearing thro' the storm, Stumbling and tripping, blind and deaf and dumb, And holding to my heart an icy load I clutch'd with freezing fingers. Far away— It seem'd long miles on miles away—I saw A yellow light—unto that light I tore— And last, remember opening a door And falling, dazzled by a blinding gleam Of human faces and a flaming fire, And with a crash of voices in my ears Fading away into a world of snow. When I awaken'd to myself, I lay In my own bed at home. I started up As from an evil dream and look'd around, And to my side came one, a neighbour's wife, Mother to two young lads I taught in school. With hollow, hollow voice I question'd her, And soon knew all: how a long night had pass'd Since, with a lifeless laddie in my arms, I stumbled horror-stricken, swooning, wild Into a ploughman's cottage: at my side, My coat between his teeth, a dog; and how Senseless and cold I fell. Thence, when the storm Had pass'd away, they bore me to my home. I listen'd dumbly, catching at the sense; But when the woman mention'd Willie's name, And I was fear'd to phrase the thought that rose, She saw the question in my tearless eyes And told me—he was dead. 'Twould weary you To tell the thoughts, the fancies, and the dreams That weigh'd upon me, ere I rose in bed, But little harm'd, and sent the wife away, Rose, slowly drest, took up my staff and went To Willie's mother's cottage. As I walk'd, Though all the air was calm and cold and still, The blowing wind and dazzled snow were yet Around about. I was bewilder'd like! Ere I had time to think I found myself Beside a truckle bed, and at my side A weeping woman. And I clench'd my hands, And look'd on Willie, who had gone to sleep. In death-gown white, lay Willie fast asleep, His blue eyes closed, his tiny fingers clench'd, His lips apart a wee as if he breathed, His yellow hair kaim'd back, and on his face A smile—yet not a smile—a dim pale light Such as the snow keeps in its own soft wings. Ay, he had gone to sleep, and he was sound! And by the bed lay Donald watching still, And when I look'd, he whined, but did not move. I turn'd in silence, with my nails stuck deep In my clench'd palms; but in my heart of hearts I pray'd to God. In Willie's mother's face There was a cold and silent bitterness— I saw it plain, but saw it in a dream, And cared not. So I went my way, as grim As one who holds his breath to slay himself. What follow'd that is vague as was the rest: A winter day, a landscape hush'd in snow, A weary wind, a small white coffin borne On a man's shoulder, shapes in black, o'er all The solemn clanging of an iron bell, And lastly me and Donald standing both Beside a tiny mound of fresh-heap'd earth, And while around the snow began to fall Mistily, softly, thro' the icy air, Looking at one another, dumb and cold. And Willie's dead!—that's all I comprehend— Ay, bonnie Willie Baird has gone before: The school, the tempest, and the eerie pain, Seem but a dream,—and I am weary like. I begged old Donald hard—they gave him me— And we have lived together in this house, Long years, with no companions. There's no need Of speech between us! Here we dumbly bide, But ken each other's sorrow,—and we both Feel weary. When the nights are long and cold, And snow is falling as it falleth now, And wintry winds are moaning, here I dream Of Willie and the unfamiliar life I left behind me on the norland hills! ‘Do doggies gang to heaven?’ Willie ask'd; And ah! what Solomon of modern days Can answer that? Yet here at nights I sit, Reading the Book, with Donald at my side; And stooping, with the Book upon my knee, I sometimes gaze in Donald's patient eyes— So sad, so human, though he cannot speak— And think he knows that Willie is at peace, Far far away beyond the norland hills, Beyond the silence of the untrodden snow. LORD RONALD'S WIFE. I. Last night I toss'd upon my bed, Because I knew that she was dead: The curtains were white, the pane was blue, The moon peep'd through, And its eye was red— ‘I would that my love were awake!’ I said. II. Then I rose and the lamp of silver lit, And over the rushes lightly stept, Crept to the door and open'd it, And enter'd the room where my lady slept; And the silver lamp threw a feeble ray Over the bed on which she lay, And sparkled on her golden hair, Smiled on her lip and melted there, And I shudder'd because she look'd so fair;— For the curtains were white and the pane was blue, And the moon look'd through, And its eye was red: ‘I will hold her hand, and think,’ I said. III. And at first I could not think at all, Because her hand was so thin and cold; The gray light flicker'd along the wall, And I seem'd to be growing old; I look'd in her face and could not weep, I hated the sound of mine own deep breath, Lest it should startle her from the sleep That seem'd too sweet and mild for death. I heard the far-off clock intone So slowly, so slowly— Afar across the courts of stone, The black hound shook his chain with a moan, As the village clock chimed slowly, slowly, slowly. I pray'd that she might rise in bed, And smile and say one little word, ‘I long to see her eyes!’ I said . . I should have shriek'd if she had stirr'd. IV. I never sinn'd against thee, Sweet! And yet last night, when none could see . . I know not . . but from head to feet, I seem'd one scar of infamy: Perhaps because the fingers light I held had grown so worn and white, Perhaps because you look'd so fair, With the thin gray light on your golden hair! V. You were warm, and I was cold, Yet you loved me, little one, I knew— I could not trifle—I was old— I was wiser, carefuller, than you; I liked my horse, I liked my hound, I liked to hear the trumpet sound, Over my wine I liked to chat, But soberly, for I had mind: You wanted that, and only that, You were as light as is the wind. At times, I know, it fretted me— I chid thee mildly now and then— No fault of mine—no blame to thee— Women are women, men are men. At first you smiled to see me frown, And laughing leapt upon my knee, And kiss'd the chiding shadow down, And smooth'd my great beard merrily; But then a change came o'er you, Sweet! You walk'd about with pensive head; You tried to read, and as you read Patted your small impatient feet:— ‘She is wiser now!’ I smiling said . . And ere I doubted—you were dead. VI. All this came back upon my brain While I sat alone at your white bedside, And I remember'd in my pain Those words you spoke before you died— For around my neck your arms you flung, And smiled so sweet though death was near— ‘I was so foolish and so young! And yet I loved thee!—kiss me, dear!’ I put aside your golden hair, And kiss'd you, and you went to sleep And when I saw that death was there, My grief was cold, I could not weep; And late last night, when you were dead, I did not weep beside your bed, For the curtains were white, and the pane was blue, And the moon look'd through, And its eye was red— ‘How coldly she lies!’ I said. VII. Then loud, so loud, before I knew, The gray and black cock scream'd and crew, And I heard the far-off bells intone So slowly, so slowly, The black hound bark'd, and I rose with a groan, As the village bells chimed slowly, slowly, slowly. I dropp'd the hand so cold and thin, I gazed, and your face seem'd still and wise, And I saw the damp dull dawn stare in Like a dim drown'd face with oozy eyes; And I open'd the lattice quietly, And the cold wet air came in on me, And I pluck'd two roses with fingers chill From the roses that grew at your window-sill, I pluck'd two roses, a white and a red, Stole again to the side of your bed, Raised the edge of your winding fold, Dropp'd the roses upon your breast, Cover'd them up in the balmy cold, That none might know—and there they rest! And out at the castle-gate I crept Into the woods, and then . . I wept! But to-day they carried you from here, And I follow'd your coffin with tearless cheek— They knew not about the roses, dear!— I would not have them think me weak. VIII. And I am weary on my bed Because I know you are cold and dead; And I see you lie in darkness, Sweet! With the roses under your winding-sheet; The days and nights are dreary and cold, And I am foolish, and weak, and old. POET ANDREW. O Loom, that loud art murmuring, What doth he hear thee say or sing? Thou hummest o'er the dead one's songs, He cannot choose but hark, His heart with tearful rapture throngs, But all his face grows dark. O cottage Fire, that burnest bright, What pictures sees he in thy light? A city's smoke, a white white face, Phantoms that fade and die, And last, the lonely burial-place On the windy hill hard by. 'Tis near a year since Andrew went to sleep— A winter and a summer. Yonder bed Is where the boy was born, and where he died, And yonder o'er the lowland is his grave: The nook of grass and gowans where in thought I found you standing at the set o' sun . . The Lord content us—'tis a weary world. These five-and-twenty years I've wrought and wrought In this same dwelling;—hearken! you can hear The looms that whuzzle-whazzle ben the house, Where Jean and Mysie, lassies in their teens, And Jamie, and a neighbour's son beside, Work late and early. Andrew who is dead Was our first-born; and when he crying came, With beaded een and pale old-farrant face, Out of the darkness, Mysie and mysel Were young and heartsome; and his smile, be sure, Made daily toil the sweeter. Hey, his kiss Put honey in the very porridge-pot! His smile strung threads of sunshine on the loom! And when he hung around his mother's neck, He deck'd her out in jewels and in gold That even ladies envied!.. Weel!.. in time Came other children, newer gems and gold, And Andrew quitted Mysie's breast for mine. So years roll'd on, like bobbins on a loom; And Mysie and mysel' had work to do, And Andrew took his turn among the rest, No sweeter, dearer; till, one Sabbath day, When Andrew was a curly-pated tot Of sunny summers six, I had a crack With Mister Mucklewraith the Minister, Who put his kindly hand on Andrew's head, Call'd him a clever wean, a bonnie wean, Clever at learning, while the mannikin Blush'd red as any rose, and peeping up Went twinkle-twinkle with his round black een; And then, while Andrew laugh'd and ran awa', The Minister went deeper in his praise, And prophesied he would become in time A man of mark. This set me thinking, sir, And watching,—and the mannock puzzled me. Would sit for hours upon a stool and draw Droll faces on the slate, while other lads Were shouting at their play; dumbly would lie Beside the Lintock, sailing, piloting, Navies of docken-leaves a summer day; Had learn'd the hymns of Doctor Watts by heart And as for old Scots songs, could lilt them a'— From Yarrow Braes to Bonnie Bessie Lee— And where he learn'd them, only Heaven knew; And oft, altho' he feared to sleep his lane, Would cowrie at the threshold in a storm To watch the lightning,—as a birdie sits, With fluttering fearsome heart and dripping wings, Among the branches. Once, I mind it weel, In came he, running, with a bloody nose, Part tears, part pleasure, to his fluttering heart Holding a callow mavis golden-bill'd, The thin white film of death across its een, And told us, sobbing, how a neighbour's son Harried the birdie's nest, and how by chance He came upon the thief beside the burn Throwing the birdies in to see them swim, And how he fought him, till he yielded up This one, the one remaining of the nest;— And ‘O the birdie's dying!’ sobb'd he sore, ‘The bonnie birdie's dying!’—till it died; And Andrew dug a grave behind the house, Buried his dead, and cover'd it with earth, And cut, to mark the grave, a grassy turf Where blew a bunch of gowans. After that, I thought and thought, and thick as bees the thoughts Buzz'd to the whuzzle-whazzling of the loom— I could make naething of the mannikin! But by-and-by, when Hope was making hay, And web-work rose, I settled it and said To the good wife, ‘'Tis plain that yonder lad Will never take to weaving—and at school They say he beats the rest at all his tasks Save figures only: I have settled it: Andrew shall be a minister—a pride And comfort to us, Mysie, in our age: He shall to college in a year or twa (If fortune smiles as now) at Edinglass.’ You guess the wife open'd her een, cried ‘Foosh!’ And call'd the plan a silly senseless dream, A hopeless, useless castle in the air; But ere the night was out, I talk'd her o'er, And here she sat, her hands upon her knees, Glow'ring and heark'ning, as I conjured up, Amid the fog and reek of Edinglass Life's peaceful gloaming and a godly fame. So it was broach'd, and after many cracks With Mister Mucklewraith, we plann'd it a', And day by day we laid a penny by To give the lad when he should quit the bield. And years wore on; and year on year was cheer'd By thoughts of Andrew, drest in decent black, Throned in a Pulpit, preaching out the Word, A house his own, and all the country-side To touch their bonnets to him. Weel, the lad Grew up among us, and at seventeen His hands were genty white, and he was tall, And slim, and narrow-shoulder'd: pale of face, Silent, and bashful. Then we first began To feel how muckle more he knew than we, To eye his knowledge in a kind of fear, As folk might look upon a crouching beast, Bonnie, but like enough to rise and bite. Up came the cloud between us silly folk And the young lad that sat among his books Amid the silence of the night; and oft It pain'd us sore to fancy he would learn Enough to make him look with shame and scorn On this old dwelling. 'Twas his manner, sir! He seldom lookt his father in the face, And when he walkt about the dwelling, seem'd Like one superior; dumbly he would steal To the burnside, or into Lintlin Woods, With some new-farrant book,—and when I peep'd, Behold a book of jingling-jangling rhyme, Fine-written nothings on a printed page, And, press'd between the leaves, a flower perchance, Anemone or blue forget-me-not, Pluckt in the grassy woodland. Then I look'd Into his drawer, among his papers there, And found—you guess?—a heap of idle rhymes, Big-sounding, like the worthless printed book: Some in old copies scribbled, some on scraps Of writing paper, others finely writ With spirls and flourishes on big white sheets. I clench'd my teeth, and groan'd. The beauteous dream Of the good Preacher in his braw black dress, With house and income snug, began to fade Before the picture of a drunken loon Bawling out songs beneath the moon and stars,— Of poet Willie Clay, who wrote a book About King Robert Bruce, and aye got fou, And scatter'd stars in verse, and aye got fou, Wept the world's sins, and then got fou, again,— Of Ferguson, the feckless limb o' law,— And Robin Burns, who gauged the whisky-casks And brake the seventh commandment. So at once I up and said to Andrew, ‘You're a fool! You waste your time in silly senseless verse, Lame as your own conceit: take heed! take heed! Or, like your betters, come to grief ere long!’ But Andrew flusht and never spake a word, Yet eyed me sidelong with his beaded een, And turn'd awa', and, as he turn'd, his look— Half scorn, half sorrow—stang me. After that, I felt he never heeded word of ours, And tho' we tried to teach him common-sense He idled as he pleased; and many a year, After I spake him first, that look of his Came dark between us, and I held my tongue, And felt he scorn'd me for the poetry's sake. This coldness grew and grew, until at last We sat whole nights before the fire and spoke No word to one another. One fine day, Says Mister Mucklewraith to me, says he, ‘So! you've a Poet in your house!’ and smiled; ‘A Poet? God forbid!’ I cried; and then It all came out: how Andrew slyly sent Verse to he paper; how they printed it In Poet's Corner; how the printed verse Had ca't a girdle in the callant's head; How Mistress Mucklewraith they thought half daft Had cut the verses out and pasted them In albums, and had praised them to her friends. I said but little; for my schemes and dreams Were tumbling down like castles in the air, And all my heart seem'd hardening to stone. But after that, in secret stealth, I bought The papers, hunted out the printed verse, And read it like a thief; thought some were good, And others foolish havers, and in most Saw naething, neither common-sense nor sound— Words pottle-bellied, meaningless, and strange, That strutted up and down the printed page, Like bailies made to bluster and look big. 'Twas useless grumbling. All my silent looks Were lost, all Mysie's flyting fell on ears Choke-full of other counsel; but we talk'd In bed o' nights, and Mysie wept, and I Felt stubborn, wrothful, wrong'd. It was to be! But mind you, though we mourn'd, we ne'er forsook The college scheme. Our sorrow, as we saw Our Andrew growing cold to homely ways, And scornful of the bield, but strengthen'd more Our wholesome wish to educate the lad, And do our duty by him, and help him on With our rough hands—the Lord would do the rest, The Lord would mend or mar him. So at last, New-clad from top to toe in homespun cloth, With books and linen in a muckle trunk, He went his way to college; and we sat, Mysie and me, in weary darkness here; For tho' the younger bairns were still about, It seem'd our hearts had gone to Edinglass With Andrew, and were choking in the reek Of Edinglass town. It was a gruesome fight, Both for oursel's at home, and for the boy, That student life at college. Hard it was To scrape the fees together, but beside, The lad was young and needed meat and drink. We sent him meal and bannocks by the train, And country cheeses; and with this and that, Though sorely push'd, he throve, though now and then With empty wame: spinning the siller out By teaching grammar in a school at night. Whiles he came home: weary old-farrant face Pale from the midnight candle; bringing home Good news of college. Then we shook awa' The old sad load, began to build again Our airy castles, and were hopeful Time Would heal our wounds. But, sir, they plagued me still— Some of his ways! When here, he spent his time In yonder chamber, or about the woods, And by the waterside,—and with him books Of poetry, as of old. Mysel' could get But little of his company or tongue; And when we talkt, atweel, a kind of frost,— My consciousness of silly ignorance, And worse, my knowledge that the lad himsel' Felt sorely, keenly, all my ignorant shame, Made talk a torture out of which we crept With burning faces. Could you understand One who was wild as if he found a mine Of golden guineas, when he noticed first The soft green streaks in a snowdrop's inner leaves? And once again, the moonlight glimmering Thro' watery transparent stalks of flax? A flower's a flower! . . . But Andrew snooved about, Aye finding wonders, mighty mysteries, In things that ilka learless cottar kenn'd. Now, 'twas the falling snow or murmuring rain; Now, 'twas the laverock singing in the sun, And dropping slowly to the callow young; Now, an old tune he heard his mother lilt; And aye those trifles made his pallid face Flush brighter, and his een flash keener far, Than when he heard of yonder storm in France, Or a King's death, or, if the like had been, A city's downfall. He was born with love For things both great and small: yet seem'd to prize The small things best. To me, it seem'd indeed The callant cared for nothing for itsel', But for some special quality it had To set him thinking, or at least bestow A tearful sense he took for luxury. He loved us in his silent fashion weel; But in our feckless ignorance we knew 'Twas when the humour seized him—with a sense Of some queer power we had to waken up The poetry—ay, and help him in his rhyme! A kind of patronising tenderness, A pitying pleasure in our Scottish speech And homely ways, a love that made him note Both ways and speech with the same curious joy As fill'd him when he watch'd the birds and flowers. He was as sore a puzzle to us then As he had been before. It puzzled us, How a big lad, down-cheek'd, almost a man, Could pass his time in silly childish joys . . . Until at last, a hasty letter came From Andrew, telling he had broke awa' From college, pack'd his things, and taken train To London city, where he hoped (he said) To make both fortune and a noble fame Thro' a grand poem, carried in his trunk; How, after struggling on with bitter heart, He could no longer bear to fight his way Among the common scholars; and the end Bade us be hopeful, trusting God, and sure The light of this old home would guide him still Amid the reek of evil. Sae it was! We twa were less amazed than you may guess, Though we had hoped, and fear'd, and hoped, so long! But it was hard to bear—hard, hard, to bear! Our castle in the clouds was gone for good; And as for Andrew—other lads had ta'en The same mad path, and learn'd the bitter task Of poverty and tears. She grat. I sat, In silence, looking on the fuffing fire, Where streets and ghaistly faces came and went, And London city crumbled down to crush Our Andrew; and my heart was sick and cold. Ere long, the news across the country-side Speak quickly, like the crowing of a cock From farm to farm—the women talkt it o'er On doorsteps, o'er the garden rails; the men Got fu' upon it at the public-house, And whisper'd it among the fields at work. A cry was quickly raised from house to house, That all the blame was mine, and canker'd een Lookt cold upon me, as upon a kind Of upstart. ‘Fie on pride!’ the whisper said, ‘The fault was Andrew's less than those who taught His heart to look in scorn on honest work,— Shame on them!—but the lad, poor lad, would learn!’ O sir, the thought of this spoil'd many a web In yonder—tingling, tingling, in my ears, Until I fairly threw my gloom aside, Smiled like a man whose heart is light and young, And with a future-kenning happy look Threw up my chin, and bade them wait and see . . . But, night by night, these een lookt London-ways, And saw my laddie wandering all alone 'Mid darkness, fog, and reek, growing afar To dark proportions and gigantic shape— Just as the figure of a sheep-herd looms, Awful and silent, thro' a mountain mist! You may be ken the rest. At first, there came Proud letters, swiftly writ, telling how folk Now roundly call'd him ‘Poet,’ holding out Bright pictures, which we smiled at wearily— As people smile at pictures in a book, Untrue but bonnie. Then the letters ceased, There came a silence cold and still as frost,— We sat and hearken'd to our beating hearts, And pray'd as we had never prav'd before. Then lastly, on the silence broke the news That Andrew, far awa', was sick to death, And, weary, weary of the noisy streets, With aching head and weary hopeless heart, Was coming home from mist and fog and noise To grassy lowlands and the caller air. 'Twas strange, 'twas strange!—but this, the weary end Of all our bonnie biggins in the clouds, Came like a tearful comfort. Love sprang up Out of the ashes of the household fire, Where Hope was fluttering like the loose white film; And Andrew, our own boy, seemed nearer now To this old dwelling and our aching hearts Than he had ever been since he became Wise with book-learning. With an eager pain, I met him at the train and brought him home; And when we met that sunny day in hairst, The ice that long had sunder'd us had thaw'd, We met in silence, and our een were dim. Ah!—I can see that look of his this night! Part pain, part tenderness—a weary look Yearning for comfort such as God the Lord Puts into parents' een. I brought him here. Gently we set him down beside the fire, And spake few words, and hush'd the noisy house; Then eyed his hollow cheeks and lustrous een, His clammy hueless brow and faded hands, Blue vein'd and white like lily-flowers. The wife Forgot the sickness of his face, and moved With light and happy footstep but and ben, As though she welcomed to a merry feast A happy guest. In time, out came the truth: Andrew was dying: in his lungs the dust Of cities stole unseen, and hot as fire Burnt—like a deil's red een that gazed at Death. Too late for doctor's skill, tho' doctor's skill We had in plenty; but the ill had ta'en Too sure a grip. Andrew was dying, dying: The beauteous dream had melted like a mist The sunlight feeds on: a' remaining now Was Andrew, bare and barren of his pride, Stark of conceit, a weel-belovëd child, Helpless to help himsel', and dearer thus, As when his yaumer Yaumer, a child's cry.—like the corn-craik's cry Heard in a field of wheat at dead o' night— Brake on the hearkening darkness of the bield. And as he nearer grew to God the Lord, Nearer and dearer ilka day he grew To Mysie and mysel'—our own to love, The world's no longer. For the first last time, We twa, the lad and I, could sit and crack With open hearts—free-spoken, at our ease; I seem'd to know as muckle then as he, Because I was sae sad. Thus grief, sae deep It flow'd without a murmur, brought the balm Which blunts the edge of worldly sense and makes Old people weans again. In this sad time, We never troubled at his childish ways; We seem'd to share his pleasure when he sat List'ning to birds upon the eaves; we felt Small wonder when we found him weeping o'er His old torn books of pencill'd thoughts and verse; And if, outbye, I saw a bonnie flower, I pluckt it carefully and bore it home To my sick boy. To me, it somehow seem'd His care for lovely earthly things had changed— Changed from the curious love it once had been, Grown larger, bigger, holier, peacefuller; And though he never lost the luxury Of loving beauteous things for poetry's sake, His heart was God the Lord's, and he was calm. Death came to lengthen out his solemn thoughts Like shadows to the sunset. So we ceased To wonder. What is folly in a lad Healthy and heartsome, one with work to do, Befits the freedom of a dying man . . . Mother, who chided loud the idle lad Of old, now sat her sadly by his side, And read from out the Bible soft and low, Or lilted lowly, keeking in his face, The old Scots songs that made his een so dim! I went about my daily work as one Who waits to hear a knocking at the door, Ere Death creeps in and shadows those that watch; And seated here at e'en i' the ingleside, I watch'd the pictures in the fire and smoked My pipe in silence; for my head was fu' Of many rhymes the lad had made of old (Rhymes I had read in secret, as I said), No one of which I minded till they came Unsummon'd, murmuring about my ears Like bees among the leaves. The end drew near. Came Winter moaning, and the Doctor said That Andrew couldna live to see the Spring; And day by day, while frost was hard at work, The lad grew weaker, paler, and the blood Came redder from the lung. One Sabbath day— The last of winter, for the caller air Was drawing sweetness from the barks of trees— When down the lane, I saw to my surprise A snowdrop blooming underneath a birk, And gladly pluckt the flower to carry home To Andrew. Ere I reach'd the bield, the air Was thick wi' snow, and ben in yonder room I found him, Mysie seated at his side, Drawn to the window in the old arm-chair, Gazing with lustrous een and sickly cheek Out on the shower, that waver'd softly down In glistening siller glamour. Saying nought, Into his hand I put the year's first flower, And turn'd awa' to hide my face; and he . . . . He smiled . . and at the smile, I knew not why, It swam upon us, in a frosty pain, The end of a' was come at last, and Death Was creeping ben, his shadow on our hearts. We gazed on Andrew, call'd him by his name, And touch'd him softly . . and he lay awhile, His een upon the snow, in a dark dream, Yet neither heard nor saw; but suddenly, He shook awa' the vision wi' a smile, Raised lustrous een, still smiling, to the sky, Next upon us, then dropt them to the flower That trembled in his hand, and murmur'd low, Like one that gladly murmurs to himsel'— ‘Out of the Snow, the Snowdrop—out of Death Comes Life;’ then closed his eyes and made a moan, And never spake another word again. . . And you think weel of Andrew's book? You think That folk will love him, for the poetry's sake, Many a year to come? We take it kind You speak so weel of Andrew!—As for me, I can make naething of the printed book; I am no scholar, sir, as I have said, And Mysie there can just read print a wee. Ay! we are feckless, ignorant of the world! And though 'twere joy to have our boy again And place him far above our lowly house, We like to think of Andrew as he was When, dumb and wee, he hung his helpless arms Round Mysie's neck; or—as he is this night— Lying asleep, his face to heaven—asleep, Near to our hearts, as when he was a bairn, Without the poetry and human pride That came between us to our grief, langsyne! WHITE LILY OF WEARDALEHEAD. THE ELVES. All day the sunshine loves to dwell Upon the pool of Weardale Well; But when the sunbeams shine no more The Monk stalks down the moonlit dell: His robe is black, his hair is hoar, He sits him down by Weardale Well; He hears the water moan below, He sees a face as white as snow, His nightly penance there is done, And he shall never see the sun. THE MONK. Hear them, old Anatomy! Down the glade I see them flee— White-robed Elfins, three times three! THE ELVES. Night by night, in pale moonlight, The Monk shall tell his story o'er, And the grinning Gnome with teeth of white Hearkeneth laughing evermore; His nightly penance thus is done— And he shall never see the sun! THE GNOME. Ever new and ever old, Comrade, be thy story told, While the face as white as snow Sighs upon the pool below. THE MONK. ‘I love the sunshine,’ said White Lily of Weardale-head. And underneath the greenwood tree, She wander' free, she wander'd bold; The merry sun smiled bright to see, And turn'd her yellow hair to gold: Then the bee, and the moth, and the butterfly Hunting for sweets in the wood-bowers fair, Rose from the blooms as she wander'd by, And played in the light of her shining hair. She sat her down by Weardale Well, And her gleaming ringlets rustled and fell, Clothing her round with a golden glow, And her shadow was light for the pool below; Then the yellow adder fold in fold Writhed from his lair in the grass and roll'd With glittering scales in a curl o' the gold: She stroked his head with her finger light, And he gazed with still and glistening eye; And she laught and clapt her hands of white, And overhead the sun went by Thro' the azure gulfs of a cloudless sky; ‘All things that love the sun, love me, And O but the sun is sweet to see, And I love to look on the sun,’ said she. But the Abbess gray of Lintlin Brae Hated to look on the light of day; She mumbled prayers, she counted beads, She whipt and whipt her shoulders bare, She slept on a bed of straw and reeds, And wore a serk of horse's hair. By candle-light she sat and read, And heard a song from far away, She cross'd herself and raised her head— ‘Who sings so loud?’ said the Abbess gray. I, who sat both early and late A shadow black at the Abbey gate, ‘Mater sacra, it is one Who wanders evermore in the sun, A little maiden of Weardale-head, Whose father and mother have long been dead, But she loves to wander in greenwood bowers, Singing and plucking the forest flowers.’ The Abbess frown'd, half quick, half dead, ‘There is a sin!’ the Abbess said. I found her singing a ditty wild, Her gleaming locks around her roll'd; I seized her while she sang and smiled, And dragged her along by the hair of gold: The moth and butterfly, fluttering, Follow'd me on to Lintlin Brae, The adder leapt at my heart to sting, But with sandall'd heel I thrust it away; And the bee dropt down ere I was 'ware On the hand that gript the yellow hair, And stang me deep, and I cursed aloud, And the sun went in behind a cloud! THE ELVES. Nightly be his penance done! He shall never see the sun! THE MONK. The cell was deep, the cell was cold, It quench'd the light of her hair of gold; One little loop alone was there, One little eye-hole letting in A slender ray of light as thin As a tress of yellow hair. ‘Oh for the sunshine!’ said White Lily of Weardale-head; And in the dark she lay, Reaching her fingers small To feel the little ray That glimmer'd down the wall. And while she linger'd white as snow She heard a fluttering faint and low; And stealing thro' the looplet thin The moth and butterfly crept in— With golden shadows as they flew They waver'd up and down in air, Then dropping slowly ere she knew, Fell on her eyes and rested there: And O she slept with balmy sighs, Dreaming a dream of golden day, The shining insects on her eyes, Their shadows on her cheeks, she lay; And while she smiled on pleasant lands, On the happy sky and wood and stream, I, creeping in with outstretch'd hands, Murder'd the things that brought the dream. She woke and stretch'd her hands and smiled, Then gazed around with sunless eyes, Her white face gloom'd, her heart went wild, She sank with tears and sighs. ‘Oh for the sunshine!’ said White Lily of Weardale-head. And while she lay with cries and tears, There came a humming in her ears; And stealing through the looplet thin The yellow honey-bee crept in, And hover'd round with summer sound Round and around the gloomy cell; Then softly on her lips he fell, And moisten'd them with sweetness found Among the flowers by Weardale Well; And O she smiled and sang a song, And closed her eyelids in the shade, And thought she singing walkt among The lily-blooms in the greenwood glade. I heard the song and downward crept, And enter'd cold and black as sin, And slew, although she raved and wept, The bee that brought the sweetness in: ‘Oh for the sunshine!’ said White Lily of Weardale-head. And while she lay as white as snow She heard a hissing sad and low; And writhing through the looplet thin The little yellow snake crept in: His golden coils cast shadows dim, With glistening eye he writhed and crept, And while she smiled to welcome him, Into her breast he stole, and slept; And O his coils fell warm and sweet Upon her heart and husht its beat, And softest thrills of pleasure deep Ran through her, though she could not sleep, But lay with closëd eyes awake, Her little hand upon the snake— ‘All things that love the sun, love me, And O but the sun is sweet to see! And I long to look on the sun,’ said she. Then down, on sandall'd foot, I crept, To kill the snake that heal'd the pang, But up, with waving arms, she leapt, And out across the threshold sprang, And up the shadowy Abbey stairs, Past the gray Abbess at her prayers, Through the black court with leap and run, Out at the gate, and into the sun! There for a space she halted, blind With joy to feel the light again, But heard my rushing foot behind And sped along the Abbey lane; The sunshine made her strong and fleet, As on she fled by field and fold, Her shining locks fell to her feet In ring on ring of living gold; But the sun went in behind a cloud, As I gript her by the shining locks, I gript them tight, I laught aloud, The echoes rang through woods and rocks; Moaning she droopt, then up she sprang, The adder leapt at my heart and stang, And like a flash o' the light she fell Into the depths of Weardale Well! The adder stang with fatal fang, Around I whirl'd and shriek'd and sprang, Then fell and struggled, clenching teeth; Then to the oozy grass I clang, And gazed upon the pool beneath; The white death-film was on mine eye, Yet look'd I down in agony; And as I look'd in throes of death, In shining bubbles rose her breath And burst in little rings of light, And upward came a moaning sound; But suddenly the sun shone bright, And all the place was gold around, And to the surface, calm and dead, Uprose White Lily of Weardale-head: Her golden hair around her blown Made gentle radiance of its own; Her face was turn'd to the summer sky With smile that seem'd to live and speak, The golden moth and butterfly, With glowing shadows, on her cheek; And lying on her lips apart The honey-bee with wings of gold, And sleeping softly on her heart The yellow adder fold in fold; And as I closed mine eyes to die, Overhead the sun went by Through the azure gulfs of a cloudless sky! THE ELVES. All day the sunshine loves to dwell Upon the sleep of Weardale Well; All day there is a gentle sound, And little insects pause and sing, The butterfly and moth float round, The bee drops down with humming wing, And all the pool lies clear and cold, Yet glittering like hair of gold. All day the Monk in hollow shell Lies dumb among the Abbey-tombs, While, in the grass and foxglove-blooms, The adder basks by Weardale Well; But the adder stings his heart by night: His tale is told, his penance done, His eyes are dark, they long for light, Yet they shall never see the sun! THE ENGLISH HUSWIFE'S GOSSIP. A ploughman's English wife, bright-eyed, sharpspeech'd, Plump as a pillow, fresh as clothes new-bleach'd: The firelight dancing ruddy on her cheeks, Irons Tom's Sunday linen as she speaks. At three-and-forty, simple as a child, Soft as a sheep yet curious as a daw, Wise, cunning, in a fashion of his own, Queer, watchful, strange, a puzzle to us all:— That's John! My husband's brother—seven years Younger than Tom. When we were newly wed, John came to dwell with Tom and me for good, And now has dwelt beside us twenty years, But now, at forty-three, is breaking fast, Grows weaker, brain and body, every day. At times he works, and earns his meat and drink, At times is sick, and lies and moans in bed, Beside the noisy racket up and down He makes when he is glad. A natural! Man-bodied, but in many things a child; Unfinish'd somewhere—where, the Lord knows best Who made and guards him; wiser, craftier, Than Tom, or any other man I know, In tiny things few men perceive at all; No fool at cooking, clever at his work, Thoughtful when Tom is senseless and unkind, Kind with a grace that sweetens silentness,— But weak when other working-men are strong, And strong where they are weak. An angry word From one he loves,—and off he creeps in pain— Perhaps to ease his tender heart in tears. But easy-sadden'd, sir, is easy-pleased! Give him the babe to nurse, he sits him down, Smiles like a woman, and is glad at heart. Crazed? There's the question! Mister Mucklewraith, Yourfriend—and John's as well—will answer ‘No!’ And often has he scolded when I seem'd To answer ‘Yea.’ Of late the weary limbs Have tried the weary brain, that every day Grows feebler, duller; yet the Minister Still stands his friend and helps him as he can. ‘Tender of heart,’ says Mister Mucklewraith, ‘Tender of heart, goodwife, is wise of head: If John is weak, his heart is to be blamed; And can the erring heart of mortal be O'er gentle?’ Hey, 'tis little use to talk! The Minister is soft at heart as he! Talk of the. . . John! and home again so soon? The children are at school, the dinner o'er, Tom still is busy working at the plough. Weary?—then sit you down and rest awhile. John fears all strangers—is ashamed to speak— But stares and counts his fingers o'er as now, Yet—trust him!—when you vanish he will tell The colour of your hair, your hat, your clothes, The number of the buttons on your coat— Eh, John?—he laughs—as sly as sly can be! Now, run to Tom—as quickly as you can— Say he is wanted by the gentleman [Tom knows the name] from Mister Mucklewraith's. Off, like an arrow from a bow, you see! That's nothing! John would run until he dropt For me, and need no thanking but a smile, Would work and work his fingers to the bone, Do aught I asked, without or in the house,— And just because I cheer him merrily And speak him kindly. Tom he little likes, And would not budge a single step to serve, For Tom is rough, and says I humour him, And mocks him for his silly childish ways. And Tom has reason to be wroth at times! But yesterday John sat him on a stool, And ripp'd the bellows up, to find from where The wind came! slowly did it bit by bit, As sage as Solomon, and when 'twas done Just scratch'd his head, still puzzled, creeping off To some still corner in the meadow, there To think the puzzle out in peace alone! There is his weakness—curiosity! Those watchful, prying, curious eyes of his, That like a cat's see better in the dark, Are ne'er at rest; his hands and eyes and ears Are eager getting knowledge,—when 'tis got Lord knoweth in what corner of his head He hides it, but it ne'er sees light again! Oft he reminds me of a painter lad Who came to Inverburn a summer since, Went poking everywhere with pallid face, Thought, painted, wander'd in the woods alone, Work'd a long morning at a leaf or flower, And got the name of clever. John and he Made friends—a thing I never could make out; But, bless my life! it seem'd to me the lad Was just a John who had learnt to read and paint! He buys a coat: what does he first, but count The pockets and the buttons one by one— A mighty calculation sagely summ'd; Our eldest daughter goes to Edinglass, Brings home a box—John eyes the box with greed, And next, we catch him in the lassie's room, The box wide open, John upon the floor, And in his hand a bonnet, eyed and eyed, Turn'd o'er and o'er, examined bit by bit, Like something wondrous as a tumbled star! Our youngest has a gift—a box of toys, A penny trumpet—not a wink for John Till he has seen the whole, or by and by He gives the child a sixpence for the toy, And creeps away and cuts it up to bits In wonder and in joy. It makes me cry For fun to watch his pranks, the natural! But think not, sir, that he was ever so:— Nay! twenty years ago but few could tell That he was simpler than the rest of men— His step was firm, he kept his head erect, Could hold his tongue, because he knew full well That he was not so clever as the rest.— Now, when his wits have gone so fast asleep, He thinks he is the wisest man of men! Yet, sir, his heart is kindly to the core, Tho' sensitive to touch as fly-trap flowers: He loves them best that seem to think him wise, Consult him, notice him, and those that mock His tenderness he never will forgive. Money he saves to buy the children gifts— Clothes, toys, whate'er he fancies like to please— And many of his ways so tender are, So gentle and so good, it fires my blood To see him vex'd and troubled. Just a child! He weeps in silence, if a little ill; A cold, a headache—he is going to die; But then, again, he can be trusted, sir! (Ye cannot say the like of many men!) Tell him a secret,—torture, death itself, Would fail to make him whisper and betray. Nay, sit you down—and smoke? Ay, smoke your fill: Both John and father like their cutty-pipe; Tom will be here as fast as he can come; And I can chat and talk as well as work. John, simple as he is, has had his cares: They came upon him in his younger days When he was tougher-hearted, and I think They help'd to make him silly as he is: Time that has stolen all his little wits, By just a change of chances, might have made Our John another man and strengthen'd him; The current gave a swirl, and caught the straw, And John was doom'd to be a natural! Oft when he sits and smokes his pipe and thinks, I know by his downcast eyes and quivering lips His heart is aching; but he ne'er complains Of that—the sorest thought he has to bear. I know he thinks of Jessie Glover then; But let him be, till o'er his head the cloud Passes, and leaves a meekness and a hush Upon the heart it shadow'd. Jessie, sir?— She was a neighbour's daughter in her teens, A bold and forward huzzie, tho' her face Was pretty in its way: a jet-black eye, Hed cheeks, black eyebrows, and a comely shape The petticoat and short-gown suited well. In here she came and stood and talk'd for hours [Her tongue was like a bell upon a sheep— Her very motion seem'd to make it jing] And, ere I guess'd it, John and she were friends. She pierced the silly with her jet-black eye, Humour'd him ever, seem'd to think him wise, Was serious, gentle, kindly, to his face, And, ere I guess'd, so flatter'd his conceit That, tho' his lips were silent at her side, He grew a mighty man behind her back, Held up his head in gladness and in pride, And seem'd to have an errand in the world. At first I laugh'd and banter'd with the rest— ‘How's Jessie, John?’ and ‘Name the happy day;’ And, ‘Have ye spoken to the minister?’ Thinking it just a joke; and when the lass Would sit by John, her arm about his neck, Holding his hand in hers, and humour him, Yet laugh her fill behind the silly's back, I let it pass. I little liked her ways— I guess'd her heart was tough as cobbler's wax— Yet what of that?—'Twas but a piece of fun. A piece of fun!—'Twas serious work to John! The huzzie lured him with her wicked eyes, And danced about him, ever on the watch, Like pussie yonder playing with a mouse. I saw but little of them, never dream'd They met unknown to me; but by and by The country-side was ringing with the talk That John and she went walking thro' the fields, Sat underneath the slanted harvest sheaves Watching the glimmer of the silver moon, Met late and early—courted night and day— John earnest as you please, and Jess for fun. I held my peace awhile, and used my eyes! New bows and ribbons upon Jessie's back, Cheap brooches, and a bonnet once or twice, Proved that the piece of fun paid Jessie well, And showed why John no longer spent his pence In presents to the boys. I saw it all, But, pitying John, afraid to give him pain I spake to Jessie, sharply bade her heed, Cried ‘shame’ upon her, for her heartlessness. The huzzie laugh'd and coolly went her way, And after that came hither nevermore To talk and clatter. But the cruel sport Went on, I found. One day, to my surprise, Up came a waggon to the cottage door, John walking by the side, and while I stared He quickly carried to the kitchen here, A table, chairs, a wooden stool, a broom, Two monster saucepans, and a washing tub, And last, a roll of blankets and of sheets. The waggon went away, here linger'd John Among the things, and blushing red says he, ‘I bought them all at Farmer Simpson's sale— Ye'll keep them till I need them for myself!’ And then walk'd out. Long time I stood and stared, Puzzled, amazed; but by-and-by I saw The meaning of it all. Alas for John! The droll beginning of a stock in trade For marriage stood before me! Jessie's eyes And lying tongue had made him fairly crazed, And ta'en the little wits he had to spare. With flashing face, set teeth, away I ran To Jessie—found her washing at a tub, Covered with soap-suds—and I told her all; And for a while she could not speak a word For laughter. ‘Shame upon ye, shame, shame, shame! Thus to misuse the lad who loves ye so! Mind, Jessie Glover, folks with scanty brains Have hearts that can be broken!’ Still she laugh'd! While tears of mirth ran down her crimson cheeks And mingled with the frothy suds of soap; But, trust me, sir, I went not home again Till Jessie's parents knew her wickedness; And last, I wrung a promise from her lips From that day forth to trouble John no more, To let him know her fondness was a joke, Pass by him in the street without a word, And, though perhaps his gentle heart might ache, Shake him as one would shake a drunken man Until his sleepy wits awoke again. I watch'd that Jessie Glover kept her word. That night, when John was seated here alone, Smoking his pipe, and dreaming as I guess'd Of Jessie Glover and a wedding ring, I stole behind him silently and placed My hand upon his shoulder: when he saw The shadow on my face, he trembled, flush'd, And knew that I was sad. I sank my voice, And gently as I could I spake my mind, Spake like a mother, told him he was wrong, That Jessie only was befooling him And laugh'd his love to scorn behind his back, And last, to soothe his pain, I rail'd at her, Hoping to make him angry. Here he sat, And let his pipe go out, and hung his head, And never answer'd back a single word. 'Twas hard, 'twas hard, to make him understand! He could not, would not! All his heart was wrapt In Jessie Glover; and at twenty-three A full-grown notion thrusts its roots so deep, 'Tis hard indeed to drag it up without Tearing the heart as well. Without a word, He crept away to bed. Next morn, his eyes Were red with weeping—but 'twas plain to see He thought I wrong'd both Jessie and himself. That morning Jessie pass'd him on the road: He ran to speak—she toss'd her head and laugh'd— And sneering pass'd him by. All day he wrought In silence at the plough—ne'er had he borne A pang so quietly. At gloaming hour Home came he, weary: here was I alone: Stubborn as stone he turn'd his head away, Sat on his stool before the fire and smoked; Then while he smoked I saw his eyes were wet: ‘John!’ and I placed my hand upon his arm. He turn'd, seem'd choking, tried in vain to speak, Then fairly hid his face and wept aloud,— But never wept again. The days pass'd on. I held my tongue, and left the rest to time, And warn'd both father and the boys. My heart Was sore for John! He was so dumb and sad, Never complaining as he did of old, And toiling late and early. By-and-by, ‘Jenny,’ says he, as quiet as a lamb, ‘Ye'll keep the things I bought at Simpson's sale— I do not need them now!’ and tried to smile, But could not. Well, I thank'd him cheerily, Nor seem'd to see his heart was aching so: Then after that the boys got pence from John,— The smaller playthings, and the bigger clothes: He eased his heart by spending as of old His money on the like. Well may you cry Shame, shame on Jessie! Heartless, graceless lass! I could have whipt her shoulders with a staff!— But One above had sorer tasks in store. Ere long the village, like a peal of bells, Rang out the tale that Jessie was a thief, Had gone to Innis Farm to work a week, And stolen Maggie Fleming's watch and chain— They found them in her trunk with scores of things From poorer houses. Woe to Jessie then If Farmer Fleming had unkindly been, Nor spared her for her sickly father's sake! The punishment was spared—she kept the shame! The scandal rose, with jingling-jangling din, And chattering lasses, wives, and mothers join'd. At first she saw not that the sin was guess'd; But slowly, one by one, her lassie friends, Her very bosom-gossips, shook her off: She heard the din, she blush'd and hid her face, Shrinking away and trembling as with cold, Like Eve within the garden when her mouth Was bitter with the apple of the Tree. One night, when John returned from work and took His seat upon the stool beside the fire, I saw he knew the truth. For he was changed! His look was dark, his voice was loud, his eyes Had lost their meekness; when we spoke to him, He flush'd and answer'd sharply. He had heard The tale of Jessie's shame and wickedness,— What thought he of it all? Believe me, sir, He was a riddle still: in many things So peevish and so simple, but in one— His silly dream of Jessie Glover's face— So manly and so dumb,—with power to hide His sorrow in his heart and turn away Like one that shuts his eyes when men pass by But looks on Him. 'Twas natural to think John would have taken angry spiteful joy In Jessie's fall,—for he was ever slow Forgetting and forgiving injuries; But no! his voice was dumb, his eyes were fierce, Yet chiefly when they mention'd Jessin scorn, He seem'd confused and would not understand, Perplext as when he breaks the children's toys. Now, bold as Jessie was, she could not bear The shame her sin had brought her, and whene'er We met she tingled to the finger-tips; And soon she fled away to Edinglass To hide among the smoke. It came to pass, The Sabbath after she had flitted off, That Mister Mucklewraith (God bless him!) preach'd One of those gentle sermons low and sad Wherewith he gathers wheat for Him he serves: The text—let him who is sinless cast the first Stone at the sinner; and we knew he preach'd Of Jessie Glover. Hey! to hear him talk Ye would have sworn that Jessie was a saint, An injured thing for folk to pet and coax! But tho' ye know 'twas folly, springing up Out of a heart so kindly to the core, Your eyes were dim with tears while hearkening— He spake so low and sadly. John was there. And early down the stairs came John next day Drest in his Sabbath clothes. ‘I'm going away,’ He whispers, ‘for a day or maybe two— Don't be afraid if I'm away at night, And do not speak to Tom;’ and off he ran Ere I could question. When the evening came, No sign of John! Night pass'd, and not a sign! Tom sought him far and near without avai'. The next night came, and we were sitting here Weary and pensive, wondering, listening, To every step that pass'd, when in stept John, And sat beside the fire, and when we ask'd Where he had been, he snapt us short and crept Away to bed. But by-and-by, I heard The truth from John himself—a truth indeed That was and is a puzzle, will remain A puzzle to the end. And can ye guess Where John had been? Away in Edinglass, At Jessie Glover's side, holding her hand And looking in her eyes! ‘Jessie!’ he said; And while she stared stood scraping with his shoes, And humm'd and haw'd and stammer'd out a speech, Whose sense, made clear and shorten'd, came to this: The country folk that call'd her cruel names And mock'd her so, had done the same by him! He did not give a straw for what they said! He did not give a straw, and why should she? And tho' she laugh'd before, perchance when folk Miscall'd her, frighten'd her from home and friends, She'd turn to simple John and marry him? For he had money, seven pound and more, And yonder in his home, to stock a house, The household things he bought at Simpson's sale; John Thomson paid him well, and he could work, And, if she dried her eyes and married him, Who cared for Tom and Jennie, and the folk That thought them crazed? . . John, then and now ashamed, Said that she flung her arms about his neck, And wept as if her heart was like to break, And told him sadly that it could not be. He scratch'd his head, and stared, and answer'd nought— His stock of words was done, but last, he forced His money in the weeping woman's hand, And hasten'd home as fast as he could run. He feels it still! it haunts him night and day! Ay, silly tho' he be, he keeps the thought Of Jess still hidden in his heart; and now, Wearing away like snowdrift in the sun, If e'er he chance to see, on nights at home, One of the things he bought at Simpson's sale (I keep them still, tho' they are worn and old,) His eyes gleam up, then glisten,—then are dark. THE FAËRY FOSTER-MOTHER. I Bright Eyes, Light Eyes! Daughter of a Fay! I had not been a married wife a twelvemonth and a day, I had not nurst my little one a month upon my knee, When down among the blue-bell banks rose elfins three times three, They gript me by the raven hair, I could not cry for fear, They put a hempen rope around my waist and dragg'd me here, They made me sit and give thee suck as mortal mothers can, Bright Eyes, Light Eyes! strange and weak and wan! II Dim Face, Grim Face! lie ye there so still? Thy red red lips are at my breast, and thou may'st suck thy fill; But know ye, tho' I hold thee firm, and rock thee to and fro, 'Tis not to soothe thee into sleep, but just to still my woe? And know ye, when I lean so calm against the wall of stone, 'Tis when I shut my eyes and try to think thou art mine own? And know ye, tho' my milk be here, my heart is far away, Dim Face, Grim Face! Daughter of a Fay! III Gold Hair, Cold Hair! Daughter to a King! Wrapt in bands of snow-white silk with jewels glittering, Tiny slippers of the gold upon thy feet so thin, Silver cradle velvet-lined for thee to slumber in, Pigmy pages, crimson-hair'd, to serve thee on their knees, To bring thee toys and greenwood flowers and honey bags of bees,— I was but a peasant lass, my babe had but the milk, Gold Hair, Cold Hair! raimented in silk! IV Pale Thing, Frail Thing! dumb and weak and thin, Altho' thou ne'er dost utter sigh thou'rt shadow'd with a sin; Thy minnie scorns to suckle thee, thy minnie is an elf, Upon a bed of rose's-leaves she lies and fans herself; And though my heart is aching so for one afar from me, I often look into thy face and drop a tear for thee, And I am but a peasant born, a lowly cotter's wife, Pale Thing, Frail Thing! sucking at my life! V Weak Thing, Meek Thing! take no blame from me, Altho' my babe may fade for lack of what I give to thee; For though thou art a stranger thing, and though thou art my woe, To feel thee sucking at my breast is all the joy I know, It soothes me tho' afar away I hear my daughter call, My heart were broken if I felt no little lips at all! If I had none to tend at all, to be its nurse and slave, Weak Thing, Meek Thing! I should shriek and rave! VI Bright Eyes, Light Eyes! lying on my knee! If soon I be not taken back unto mine own countree, To feel my own babe's little lips, as I am feeling thine, To smoothe the golden threads of hair, to see the blue eyes shine,— I'll lean my head against the wall and close my weary eyes, And think my own babe draws the milk with balmy pants and sighs, And smile and bless my little one and sweetly pass away, Bright Eyes, Light Eyes! Daughter of a Fay! THE GREEN GNOME. A MELODY. Ring, sing! ring, sing! pleasant Sabbath bells! Chime, rhyme! chime, rhyme! through the dales and dells! Rhyme, ring! chime, sing! pleasant Sabbath bells! Chime, sing! rhyme, ring! over fields and fells! And I gallop'd and I gallop'd on my palfrey white as milk, My robe was of the sea-green woof, my serk was of the silk, My hair was golden yellow, and it floated to my shoe, My eyes were like two harebells bathed in shining drops of dew: My palfrey, never stopping, made a music sweetly blent With the leaves of autumn dropping all around me as I went; And I heard the bells, grown fainter, far behind me peal and play, Fainter, fainter, fainter, fainter, till they seem'd to die away; And beside a silver runnel, on a lonely heap of sand, I saw the green Gnome sitting, with his cheek upon his hand; Then he started up to see me, and he ran with cry and bound, And drew me from my palfrey white, and set me on the ground: O crimson, crimson, were his locks, his face was green to see, But he cried, ‘O light-hair'd lassie, you are bound to marry me!’ He claspt me round the middle small, he kissed me on the cheek, He kissed me once, he kissed me twice—I could not stir or speak; He kissed me twice, he kissed me thrice— but when he kissed again, I called aloud upon the name of Him who died for men! Ring, sing! ring, sing; pleasant Sabbath bells! Chime, rhyme! chime, rhyme! through the dales and dells! Rhyme, ring! chime, sing! pleasant Sabbath bells! Chime, sing! rhyme, ring! over fields and fells! O faintly, faintly, faintly, calling men and maids to pray, So faintly, faintly, faintly, rang the bells afar away; And as I named the Blessed Name, as in our need we can, The ugly green green Gnome became a tall and comely man! His hands were white, his beard was gold, his eyes were black as sloes, His tunic was of scarlet woof, and silken were his hose; A pensive light from Faëryland still linger'd on his cheek, His voice was like the running brook, when he began to speak: ‘O you have cast away the charm my step-dame put on me, Seven years I dwelt in Faëryland, and you have set me free! O I will mount thy palfrey white, and ride to kirk with thee, And by those sweetly shining eyes, we twain will wedded be!’ Back we gallop'd, never stopping, he before and I behind, And the autumn leaves were dropping, red and yellow, in the wind, And the sun was shining clearer, and my heart was high and proud, As nearer, nearer, nearer, rang the kirkbells sweet and loud, And we saw the kirk before us, as we trotted down the fells, And nearer, clearer, o'er us, rang the welcome of the bells! Ring, sing! ring, sing! pleasant Sabbath bells! Chime, rhyme! chime, rhyme! through the dales and dells! Rhyme, ring! chime, sing! pleasant Sabbath bells! Chime, sing! rhyme, ring! over fields and fells! HUGH SUTHERLAND'S PANSIES. The aged Minister of Inverburn, A mild heart hidden under features stern, Leans in the sunshine on the garden-pale, Pensive, yet happy, as he tells this tale,— And he who listens sees the garden lie Blue as a little patch of fallen sky. ‘The lily minds me of a maiden brow,’ Hugh Sutherland would say; ‘the marigold Is full and sunny like her yellow hair, The full-blown rose her lips with sweetness tipt; But if you seek a likeness to her eyes— Go to the pansy, friend, and find it there!’ ‘Ay, leeze me on the pansies!’ Hugh would say— Hugh Sutherland, the weaver—he who dwelt Here in the white-wash'd cot you fancy so— Who knew the learnëd names of all the flowers, And recognised the lily, tho' its head Rose in a ditch of dull Latinity! Pansies? You praise the ones that grow to-day Here in the garden: had you seen the place When Sutherland was living! Here they grew, From blue to deeper blue, in midst of each A golden dazzle like a glimmering star, Each broader, bigger, than a silver crown; While here the weaver sat, his labour done, Watching his azure pets and rearing them, Until they seem'd to know his step and touch, And stir beneath his smile like living things! The very sunshine loved them, and would lie Here happy, coming early, lingering late, Because they were so fair. Hugh Sutherland Was country-bred—I knew him from the time When on a bed of pain he lost a limb, And rose at last, a lame and sickly lad, Apprenticed to the loom—a peevish lad, Mooning among the shadows by himself. Among these shadows, with the privilege Of one who loved his flock, I sought him out, And gently as I could I won his heart; And then, tho' he was young and I was old, We soon grew friends. He told his griefs to me, His joys, his troubles, and I help'd him on; Yet sought in vain to drive away the cloud Deep pain had left upon his sickly cheek, And lure him from the shades that deepen'd it. Then Heaven took the task upon itself And sent an angel down among the flowers! Almost before I knew the work was done, I found him settled in this but and ben, Where, with an eye that brighten'd, he had found The sunshine loved his garden, and begun To rear his pansies. Sutherland was poor, Rude, and untutor'd; peevish, too, when first The angel in his garden found him out; But pansy-growing made his heart within Blow fresh and fragrant. When he came to share This cottage with a brother of the craft, Only some poor and sickly bunches bloom'd, Vagrant, though fair, among the gardenplots; And idly, carelessly, he water'd these, Spread them and train'd them, till they grew and grew In size and beauty, and the angel thrust Its bright arms upward thro' the bright'ning sod, And clung around the sickly gardener's heart. Then Sutherland grew calmer, and the cloud Was fading from his face. Well, by-and-by, The country people saw and praised the flowers, And what at first had been an idle joy Became a sober serious work for fame. Next, being won to send a bunch for show, He gained a prize—a sixth or seventh rate, And slowly gath'ring courage, rested not Till he had won the highest prize of all. Here in the sunshine and the shade he toil'd Early and late in joy, and, by-and-by, Rose high in fame; for not a botanist, A lover of the flowers, poor man or rich, Came to the village, but the people said ‘Go down the lane to Weaver Sutherland's, And see his pansies!’ Thus the summers pass'd, And Sutherland grew gentler, happier; The angel God had sent him clung to him: There grew a rapturous sadness in his tone When he was gladdest, like the dewiness That moistens pansies when they bloom the best; And in his face there dawn'd a gentle light Like that which softly clings about a flow'r, And makes you love it. Yet his heart was glad More for the pansies' sakes than for his own: His eye was like a father's, moist and bright, When they were praised; and, as I said, they seem'd To make themselves as beauteous as they could, Smiling to please him. Blessings on the flowers! They were his children! Father never loved His little darlings more, or for their sakes Fretted so dumbly! Father never bent More tenderly above his little ones, In the still watches of the night, when sleep Breathes balm upon their eyelids! Night and day Poor Hugh was careful for the gentle things Whose presence brought a sunshine to the place Where sickness dwelt: this one was weak and small, And needed watching like a sickly child; This one so beauteous, that it shamed its mates And made him angry with its beauteousness. ‘I cannot rest!’ cried Hughie with a smile, ‘I scarcely snatch a moment to myself— They plague me so!’ Part fun, part earnest, this: He loved the pansies better than he knew. Ev'n in the shadow of his weaving-room They haunted him and brighten'd on his soul: Daily while busy working at the loom The humming seem'd a mystic melody To which the pansies sweetly grew and grew— A leaf unrolling soft to every note, A change of colours with the change of sound; And walking to the door to rest himself, Still with the pleasant murmur in his ears, He saw the flowers and heard the melody They make in growing! Pleasure such as this, So exquisite, so lonely, might have pass'd Into the shadowy restlessness of yore; But wholesome human contact saved him here, And kept him fresh and meek. The people came To stir him with their praise, and he would show The medals and the prizes he had got— As proud and happy as a child who gains A prize in school. The angel still remain'd In winter, when the garden-plots were bare, And deep winds piloted the wandering snow: He saw its gleaming in the cottage fire, While, with a book of botany on his knee, He sat and hunger'd for the breath of spring. The angel of the flowers was with him still! Here beds of roses sweeten'd all the page; Here lilies whiter than the falling snow Crept gleaming softly from the printed lines; Here dewy violets sparkled till the book Dazzled his eyes with rays of misty blue; And here, amid a page of Latin names, All the sweet Scottish flowers together grew With fragrance of the summer. Hugh and I Were still fast friends, and still I help'd him on; And often in the pleasant summer-time, The service over, on the Sabbath day, I join'd him in the garden, where we sat And chatted in the sun. But all at once It came upon me that the gardener's hand Had grown less diligent; for tho' 'twas June The garden that had been the village pride Look'd but the shadow of its former self; And ere a week was out I saw in church Two samples fairer far than any blown In Hughie's garden—blooming brighter far In sweeter soil. What wonder that a man, Loving the pansies as the weaver did— A skilful judge, moreover—should admire Sweet Mary Moffat's sparkling pansy-eyes? The truth was out. The weaver play'd the game (I christen'd it in sport that very day) Of ‘Love among the Pansies!’ As he spoke, Telling me all, I saw upon his face The peevish cloud that it had worn in youth; I cheer'd him as I could, and bade him hope: ‘You both are poor, but, Sutherland, God's flowers Are poor as well!’ He brighten'd as I spoke, And answer'd, ‘It is settled! I have kept The secret till the last, lest “nay” should come And spoil it all; but “ay” has come instead, And all the help we wait for is your own!’ Even here, I think, his angel clung to him. The fairies of his garden haunted him With similes and sympathies that made His likes and dislikes, though he knew it not. Beauty he loved if it was meek and mild, And like his pansies tender ev'n to tears; And so he chose a maiden pure and low, Who, like his garden pets, had love to spare, Sunshine to cast upon his pallid cheek, And yet a tender clinging thing, too weak To bloom uncared for and unsmiled upon. Soon Sutherland and she he loved were one,— And bonnily a moon of honey gleam'd At night among the flowers! Amid the spring That follow'd, blossom'd with the other buds A tiny maiden with her mother's eyes. The little garden was itself again, The sunshine sparkled on the azure beds; The angel Heaven had sent to save a soul Stole from the blooms and took an infant shape; And wild with pleasure, seeing how the flowers Had given her their choicest lights and shades. The father bore his baby to the font And had her christen'd Pansy. After that Poor Hugh was happy as the days were long, Divided in his cares for all his pets, And proudest of the one he loved the best. The summer found him merry as a king, Dancing the little one upon his knee Here in the garden, while the plots around Gleam'd in the sun, and seem'd as glad as he. But moons of honey wane, and summer suns Of wedlock set to bring the autumn in! Hugh Sutherland, with wife and child to feed, Wrought sore to gain his pittance in a world His pansies made so fair. Came Poverty With haggard eyes to dwell within the house; When first she saw the garden she was glad, And, seated on the threshold, smiled and span. But times grew harder, bread was scarce as gold, A shadow fell on Pansy and the flowers; And when the strife was sorest, Hugh received An office—lighter work and higher pay— To take a foreman's place in Edinglass. 'Twas hard, 'twas hard, to leave the little place He loved so dearly; but the weaver look'd At Mary, saw the sorrow in her face, And gave consent,—happy at heart to think His dear ones would not want. To Edinglass They went, and settled. Thro' the winter hours Bravely the weaver toil'd; his wife and child Were happy, he was heartsome—tho' his taste Was grassy lowlands and the caller air. The cottage here remain d untenanted, The angel of the flowers forsook the place, The sunshine faded, and the pansies died. Two summers pass'd; and still in Edinglass The weaver toil'd, and ever when I went Into the city, to his house I hied— A welcome guest. Now first, I saw a change Had come to Sutherland: for he was pale And peevish, had a venom on his tongue, And hung the under-lip like one that doubts. Part of the truth I heard, and part I saw— But knew too late, when all the ill was done! At first, poor Hugh had shrunk from making friends, And pored among his books of botany, And later, in the dull dark nights he sat, A dismal book upon his knee, and read: A book no longer full of leaves and flowers, That glimmer'd on the soul's sweet consciousness, Yet seem'd to fill the eye,—a dismal book,— Big-sounding Latin, English dull and dark, And not a breath of summer in it all. The sunshine perish'd in the city's smoke, The pansies grew no more to comfort him, And he began to spend his nights with those Who waste their substance in the public-house: The flowers had lent a sparkle to his talk, Which pleased the muddled wits of idle men; Sought after, treated, liked by one and all, He took to drinking; and at last lay down Stupid and senseless on a rainy night, And ere he waken'd caught the flaming fire, Which gleams to white-heat on the face and burns Clear crimson in the lungs. But it was long, Ere any knew poor Hughie's plight; and, ere He saw his danger, on the mother's breast Lay Pansy withering—tho' the dewy breath Of spring was floating like a misty rain Down from the mountains. Then the tiny flower Folded its leaves in silence, and the sleep That dwells in winter on the flower-beds Fell on the weaver's house. At that sad hour I enter'd, scarcely welcomed with a word Of greeting: by the hearth the woman sat Weeping full sore, her apron o'er a face Haggard with midnight watching, while the man Cover'd his bloodshot eyes and cursed himself. Then leaning o'er, my hand on his, I said— ‘She could not bear the smoke of cities, Hugh! God to His Garden has transplanted her, Where summer dwells for ever and the air Is fresh and pure!’ But Hughie did not speak; I saw full plainly that he blamed himself; And ere the day was out he bent above His little sleeping flower, and wept, and said: ‘Ay, sir! she wither'd, wither'd like the rest, Neglected!’ and I saw his heart was full. When Pansy slept beneath the churchyard grass Poor Hughie's angel had return'd to Heaven, And all his heart was dark. His ways grew strange, Peevish, and sullen; often he would sit And drink alone; the wife and he grew cold, And harsh to one another; till at last A stern physician put an end to all, And told him he must die. No bitter cry, No sound of wailing rose within the house After the Doctor spoke, but Mary mourn'd In silence, Hughie smoked his pipe and set His teeth together, at the ingleside. Days pass'd; the only token of a change Was Hughie's face—the peevish cloud of care Seem'd melting to a tender gentleness. After a time, the wife forgot her grief, Or could at times forget it, in the care Her husband's sickness brought. I went to them As often as I could, for Sutherland Was dear to me, and dearer for his sin. Weak as he was he did his best to toil, But it was weary work! By slow degrees, When May was breathing on the sickly bunch Of mignonette upon the window-sill, I saw his smile was softly wearing round To what it used to be, when here he sat Rearing his flowers; altho' his brow at times Grew cloudy, and he gnaw'd his under lip. At last I found him seated by the hearth, Trying to read: I led his mind to themes Of old langsyne, and saw his eyes grow dim: ‘O sir,’ he cried, ‘I cannot, cannot rest! Something I long for, and I know not what, Torments me night and day!’ I saw it all, And sparkling with the brilliance of the thought, Look'd in his eyes and caught his hand, and cried, ‘Hugh, it's the pansies! Spring has come again, The sunshine breathes its gold upon the air And threads it through the petals of the flowers, Yet here you linger in the dark!’ I ceased And watch'd him. Then he trembled as he said, ‘I see it now, for as I read the book The lines and words, the Latin seem'd to bud, And they peep'd thro'.’ He smiled, like one ashamed, Adding in a low voice, ‘I long to see The pansies ere I die!’ What heart of stone Could throb on coldly, Sir, at words like those? Not mine, not mine! Within a week poor Hugh Had left the smoke of Edinglass behind, And felt the wind that runs along the lanes, Spreading a carpet of the grass and flowers For June the sunny-hair'd to walk upon. In the old cottage here he dwelt again: The place was wilder than it once had been, But buds were blowing green around about, And with the glad return of Sutherland, The angel of the flowers came back again. The end was near and Hugh was wearied out, And like a flower was closing up his leaves Under the dropping of the gloaming dews. And daily, in the summer afternoon, I found him seated on the threshold there, Watching his flowers, and all the place, I thought, Brighten'd when he was nigh. Now first I talk'd Of heavenly hopes unto him, and I knew The angel help'd me. On the day he died The pain had put its shadow on his face, The words of doubt were on his tremulous lips: ‘Ah, Hughie, life is easy!’ I exclaim'd, ‘Easier, better, than we know ourselves: 'Tis pansy-growing on a mighty scale, And God above us is the gardener. The fairest win the prizes, that is just, But all the flowers are dear to God the Lord: The Gardener loves them all, He loves them all!’ He saw the sunshine on the pansy-beds And brighten'd. Then by slow degrees he grew Cheerful and meek as dying man could be, And as I spoke there came from far-away The faint sweet melody of Sabbath bells. And ‘Hugh,’ I said, ‘if God the Gardener Neglected those he rears as you have done Your pansies and your Pansy, it were ill For we who blossom in His garden. Night And morning He is busy at His work. He smiles to give us sunshine, and we live: He stoops to pluck us softly, and our hearts Tremble to see the darkness, knowing not It is the shadow He, in stooping, casts. He pluckt your Pansy so, and it was well. But, Hugh, though some be beautiful and grand, Some sickly, like yourself, and mean and poor, He loves them all, the Gardener loves them all!’ Then later, when he could no longer sit Out on the threshold, and the end was near, We set a plate of pansies by his bed To cheer him. ‘He is coming near,’ I said, ‘Great is the garden, but the Gardener Is coming to the corner where you bloom So sickly!’ And he smiled, and moan'd, ‘I hear!’ And sank upon his pillow wearily. His hollow eyes no longer bore the light, The darkness gather'd round him as I said, ‘The Gardener is standing at your side, His shade is on you and you cannot see: O Lord, that lovest both the strong and weak, Pluck him and wear him!’ Even as I pray'd, I felt the shadow there and hid my face; But when I look'd again the flower was pluck'd, The shadow gone: the sunshine thro' the blind Gleam'd faintly, and the widow'd woman wept. THE DEAD MOTHER. I As I lay asleep, as I lay asleep, Under the grass as I lay so deep, As I lay asleep in my cotton serk Under the shade of Our Lady's Kirk, I waken'd up in the dead of night, I waken'd up in my death-serk white, And I heard a cry from far away, And I knew the voice of my daughter May: ‘Mother, mother, come hither to me! Mother, mother, come hither and see! Mother, mother, mother dear, Another mother is sitting here: My body is bruised, and in pain I cry, On straw in the dark afraid I lie, I thirst and hunger for drink and meat, And mother, mother, to sleep were sweet!’ I heard the cry, though my grave was deep, And awoke from sleep, and awoke from sleep. II I awoke from sleep, I awoke from sleep, Up I rose from my grave so deep! The earth was black, but overhead The stars were yellow, the moon was red; And I walk'd along all white and thin, And lifted the latch and enter'd in, And reach'd the chamber as dark as night, And though it was dark my face was white: ‘Mother, mother, I look on thee! Mother, mother, you frighten me! For your cheeks are thin and your hair i gray!’ But I smiled, and kiss'd her fears away, I smooth'd her hair and I sang a song, And on my knee I rock'd her long: ‘O mother, mother, sing low to me— I am sleepy now, and I cannot see!’ I kiss'd her, but I could not weep, And she went to sleep, she went to sleep. III As we lay asleep, as we lay asleep, My May and I, in our grave so deep, As we lay asleep in the midnight mirk, Under the shade of our Lady's Kirk, I waken'd up in the dead of night, Though May my daughter lay warm and white, And I heard the cry of a little one, And I knew 'twas the voice of Hugh my son: ‘Mother, mother, come hither to me! Mother, mother, come hither and see! Mother, mother, mother dear, Another mother is sitting here: My body is bruised and my heart is sad, But I speak my mind and call them bad; I thirst and hunger night and day, And were I strong I would fly away!’ I heard the cry, though my grave was deep, And awoke from sleep, and awoke from sleep! IV I awoke from sleep, I awoke from sleep, Up I rose from my grave so deep, The earth was black, but overhead The stars were yellow, the moon was red; And I walk'd along all white and thin, And lifted the atch and enter'd in. ‘Mother, mother, and art thou here? I know your face, and I feel no fear; Raise me, mother, and kiss my cheek, For oh I am weary and sore and weak.’ I smooth'd his hair with a mother's joy, And he laugh'd aloud, my own brave boy; I raised and held him on my breast, Sang him a song, and bade him rest. ‘Mother, mother, sing low to me— I am sleepy now and I cannot see!’ I kiss'd him, and I could not weep, As he went to sleep, as he went to sleep. V As I lay asleep, as I lay asleep, With my girl and boy in my grave so deep, As I lay asleep, I awoke in fear, Awoke, but awoke not my children dear, And heard a cry so low and weak From a tiny voice that could not speak; I heard the cry of a little one, My bairn that could neither talk nor run, My little, little one, uncaress'd, Starving for lack of the milk of the breast; And I rose from sleep and enter'd in, And found my little one pinch'd and thin, And croon'd a song and hush'd its moan, And put its lips to my white breast-bone; And the red, red moon that lit the place Went white to look at the little face, And I kiss'd and kiss'd, and I could not weep, As it went to sleep, as it went to sleep. VI As it lay asleep, as it lay asleep, I set it down in the darkness deep, Smooth'd its limbs and laid it out, And drew the curtains around about; Then into the dark, dark room I hied Where he lay awake at the woman's side, And though the chamber was black as night, He saw my face, for it was so white; I gazed in his eyes, and he shriek'd in pain, And I knew he would never sleep again, And back to my grave went silently, And soon my baby was brought to me; My son and daughter beside me rest, My little baby is on my breast; Our bed is warm and our grave is deep, But he cannct sleep, he cannot sleep! THE WIDOW MYSIE. An Idyl of Love and Whisky. Tom Love, a man ‘prepared for friend or foe, Whisker'd, well-featured, tight from top to toe.’ O Widow Mysie, smiling, soft, and sweet! O Mysie, buxom as a sheaf of wheat! O Mysie, Widow Mysie, late Monroe, Foul fall the traitor-face that served me so! O Mysie Love, a second time a bride, I pity him who tosses at your side— Who took, by honied smiles and speech misled, A beauteous bush of brambles to his bed! You saw her at the ploughing match, you ken, Ogling the whisky and the handsome men: The smiling woman in the Paisley shawl, Plump as a partridge, and as broad as tall, With ribbons, bows, and jewels fair to see, Bursting to blossom like an apple-tree, Ay, that was Mysie,—now two score and ten, Now Madam Love of Bungo in the Glen! Ay, that was Mysie, tho' her looks no more Dazzle with beams of brightness as of yore!— The tiny imps that nested in her eyes, Winning alike the wanton and the wise, Have ta'en the flame that made my heart forlorn Back to the nameless place, where they were born. O years roll on, and fair things fade and pine!— Twelve sowings since and I was twenty-nine: With ploughman's coat on back, and plough in hand, I wrought at Bungo on my father's land, And all the neighbour-lassies, stale or fair, Tried hard to net my father's son and heir. My heart was lightsome, cares I had but few, I climb'd the mountains, drank the mountain dew, Could sit a mare as mettlesome as fire, Could put the stone with any in the shire, Had been to college, and had learn'd to dance, Could blether thro' my nose like folks in France, And stood erect, prepared for friend or foe, Whisker'd, well-featured, tight from top to toe. ‘A marriageable man, for every claim Of lawful wedlock fitted,’ you exclaim? But, sir, of all that men enjoy or treasure, Wedlock, I fancied, was the driest pleasure. True; seated at some pretty peasant's side, Under the slanted sheaves I loved to hide, Lilting the burthen of a Scottish tune, To sit, and kiss perchance, and watch the moon, Pillow'd on breasts like beds of lilies white Heaving and falling in the pale moonlight; But rather would have sat with crimson face Upon the cutty-stool with Jean or Grace, Than buy in kirk a partner with the power To turn the mother-milk of Freedom sour. I loved a comely face, as I have said, But sharply watch'd the maids who wish'd to wed,— I knew their arts, was not so cheaply won, They loved my father's Siller, not his Son. Still, laughing in my sleeve, I here and there Took liberties allow'd my father's heir, Stole kisses from the comeliest of the crew, And smiled upon the virgin nettles too. So might the game have daunder'd on till this, And lasted till my father went to bliss,— But Widow Mysie came, as sly as sin, And settled in the ‘William Wallace’ Inn. The Inn had gone to rack and loss complete Since Simpson drown'd himself in whisky neat; And poor Jock Watt, who follow'd in his shoes, Back'd by the sourest, gumliest of shrews, (The whisky vile, the water never hot, The very sugar sour'd by Mistress Watt,) Had found the gossips, grumbling, groaning, stray To Sandie Kirkson's, half a mile away. But hey! at Widow Mysie's rosy face, A change came o'er the spirits of the place, The fire blazed high, the shining pewter smiled, The glasses glitter'd bright, the water boil'd, Grand was the whisky, Highland born and fine, And Mysie, Widow Mysie, was divine! O sweet was Widow Mysie, sweet and sleek! The peach's blush and down were on her cheek, And there were dimples in her tender chin For Cupids small to hunt for kisses in; Dark-glossy were her ringlets, each a prize, And wicked, wicked were her beaded eyes; Plump was her figure, rounded and complete, And tender were her tiny tinkling feet! All this was nothing to the warmth and light That seem'd to hover o'er her day and night;— Where'er she moved, she seem'd to soothe and please With pleasant murmurs as of humble-bees; Her small plump hands on public missions flew Like snow-white doves that flying croon and coo; Her feet fell patter, cheep, like little mice; Her breath was soft with sugar and with spice; And when her finger—so!—your hand would press, You tingled to the toes with loveliness, While her dark eyes, with lessening zone in zone, Flasht sunlight on the mirrors of your own, Dazzling your spirit with a wicked sense That seem'd more heavenly-born than innocence! Sure one so beauteous and so sweet had graced And cheer'd the scene, where'er by Fortune placed; But with a background of the pewter bright, Whereon the fire cast gleams of rosy light, With jingling glasses round her, and a scent Of spice and lemon-peel where'er she went, What wonder she should to the cronies seem An angel, in a cloud of toddy steam? What wonder, while I sipt my glass one day, She, and the whisky, stole my heart away? She was not loath!—for, while her comely face Shone full on other haunters of the place, From me she turn'd her head and peep'd full sly With just the corner of her roguish eye, And blush'd so bright my toddy seem'd to glow Beneath the rosy blush and sweeter grow; And once, at my request, she took a sip, And nectar'd all the liquor with her lip. ‘Take heed! for Widow Mysie's game is plain,’ The gossips cried, but warn'd me all in vain: Like sugar melting at the toddy's kiss, My very caution was dissolved in bliss, Fear died for ever with a mocking laugh, And Mysie's kisses made his epitaph. Kisses? Ay, faith, they follow'd score on score, After the first I stole behind the door, And lingered softly on these lips of mine Like Massic whisky drunk by bards divine. But O! the glow, the rapture, and the glee, That night she let me draw her on my knee— When bliss thrill'd from her to my fingertips, Then eddied wildly to my burning lips, From which she drank it back with kisses fain, Then blush'd and glow'd and breathed it back again— Till, madden'd with the ecstasy divine, I clasp'd her close and craved her to be mine, And thrilling, panting, struggling up to fly, She breathed a spicy ‘Yes’ with glistening eye, And while my veins grew fire, my heart went wild, Fell like a sunbeam on my heart, and smiled! The deed thus done, I hied me home, you say, And rued my folly when I woke next day? Nay! all my business was to crave and cry That Heaven would haste the holy knot to tie, Though ‘Mysie lass,’ I said, ‘my gold and gear Are small, and will be small for many a year, Since father is but fifty years and three, And tough as cobbler's wax, though spare and wee!’ ‘Ah, Tam,’ she sigh'd, ‘there's nothing there to rue— The gold, the gear, that Mysie wants is you!’ And brightly clad, with kisses thrilling through me, Clung like a branch of trembling blossoms to me. I found my father making up his books, With yellow eyes and penny-hunting looks. ‘Father,’ I said, ‘I'm sick of single life, And will, if you are willing, take a wife.’ ‘Humph,’ snapt my father, ‘(six and four are ten, And ten are twenty)—Marry? who? and when?’ ‘Mistress Monroe,’ I said, ‘that keeps the inn.’ At that he shrugg'd his shoulders with a grin: ‘I guess'd as much! the tale has gone the round! Ye might have stay'd till I was underground! But please yourself—I've nothing to refuse, Choose where you will—you're old enough to choose; But mind,’ he added, blinking yellow eye, ‘I'll handle my own guineas till I die! Frankly I own, you might have chosen worse, Since you have little siller in your purse— The Inn is thriving, if report be true, And Widow Mysie has enough for two!’ ‘And if we wait till he has gone his way, Why, Mysie, I'll be bald, and you'll be gray,’ I said to Mysie, laughing at her side. ‘Oh, let him keep his riches,’ she replied, ‘He's right! there's plenty here for you and me! May he live long; and happy may he be!’ ‘O Mysie, you're an angel,’ I return'd, With eye that glisten'd dewily and yearn'd. Then running off she mixed, with tender glee, A glass of comfort—sat her on my knee— ‘Come, Tam!’ she cried, ‘who cares a fig for wealth— Ay, let him keep it all, and here's his health!’ And added, shining brightly on my breast, ‘Ah, Tam, the siller's worthless—Love is best!’ O Widow Mysie, wert thou first sincere, When tender accents trembled on mine ear, Like bees that o'er a flower will float and fleet, And ere they light make murmurs soft and sweet? Or was the light that render'd me unwise, Guile's—the sly Quaker with the downcast eyes? O Widow Mysie, not at once are we Taught the false scripture of Hypocrisy! Even pink Selfishness has times, I know, When thro' his fat a patriot's feelings glow; Falsehood first learns her nature with a sigh, And nurses bitterly her first-born Lie! Days pass'd; and I began, to my amaze, To see a colder light in Mysie's gaze; Once when, with arm about her softly wound, I snatch'd a kiss, she snapt and flusht and frown'd; But oftener her face a shadow wore, Such as had never darken'd it before; I spoke of this, I begg'd her to explain,— She tapt my cheek, and smiled, and mused again. But, in the middle of my love-alarm, The Leech's watch went ‘tick’ at Bungo Farm; My father sicken'd, and his features cold Retain'd the hue, without the gleam, of gold. Then Mysie soften'd, sadden'd, and would speak Of father's sickness with a dewy cheek; When to the Inn I wander'd. unto me, Lightly, as if she walk'd on wool, came she, And ‘Is he better?’ ‘Is he changed at all?’ And ‘Heaven help him!’ tenderly would call. ‘So old—so ill—untended and alone! He is your father, Tam,—and seems my own!’ And musing stood, one little hand of snow Nestling and fluttering on my shoulder—so! But father sicken'd on, and then one night, When we were sitting in the ingle-light, ‘O Tam,’ she cried, ‘I have it!—I should ne'er Forgive myself for staying idly here, While he, your father, lack'd in his distress The love, the care, a daughter's hands possess— He knows our troth—he will not say me nay; But let me nurse him as a daughter may, And he may live, for darker cases mend, To bless us and to join us in the end!’ ‘But, Mysie—’ ‘Not a word, the thing is plann'd,’ She said, and stopt my mouth with warm white hand. She went with gentle eyes that very night, Stole to the chamber like a moonbeam white; My father scowl'd at first, but soon was won— The keep was carried, and the deed was done. O Heaven! in what strange Enchanter's den Learnt she the spells wherewith she conquer'd inen? When to that chamber she had won her way, The old man's cheek grew brighter every day; She smooth'd the pillows underneath his head, She brought sweet music roundabout his bed, She made the very mustard-blisters glow With fire as soft as youthful lovers know, The very physic bottles lost their gloom And seem'd like little fairies in the room, The very physic, charm'd by her, grew fine, Rhubarb was nectar, castor-oil was wine. Half darkly, dimly, yet with secret flame That titillated up and down his frame, The grim old man lay still, with hungry eye Watching her thro' the room on tiptoe fly;— She turn'd her back—his cheek grew dull and dim! She turn'd her face—its sunshine fell on him! Better and better every day grew he, Colder and colder grew his nurse to me, Till up he leapt, with fresher new life astir, And only sank again—to kneel to her! ‘Mysie!’ I cried, with flushing face, too late Stung by the pois'nous things whose names I hate, Which in so many household fires flit free, The salamanders, Doubt and Jealousy,— ‘Mysie!’—and then, in accents fierce and bold, Demanded why her looks had grown so cold? She trembled, flush'd, a tear was in her eye, She dropt her gaze, and heaved a balmy sigh, Then spoke with tender pauses low and sad: Had I a heart? She knew full well I had. Could I without a conscience-qualm behold My white-hair'd father, weak, untended, old, Who had so very short a time to live, Reft of the peacea woman's hands can give? ‘Mysie!’ I shriek'd, with heart that seem'd to rend, With glaring eyes, and every hair on end. Clasping her little hands, ‘O Tam,’ she cried, ‘Save for my help your father would have died; Bliss! to have saved your filial heart that sorrow! But for my help, why, he may die to-morrow. Go, Tam!—this weak warm heart I cannot trust To utter more—be generous! be just! I long have felt—I say it in humility— A sort of—kind of—incompatibility! Go, Tam! Be happy! Bless you! Wed another! And I shall ever love you!—as a mother!’ Sir, so it was. Stunn'd, thunder-stricken, wild, I raved, while father trembled, Mysie smiled; O'er all the country-side the scandal rang, And ere I knew, the bells began to clang;— And shutting eyes and stopping ears, as red As ricks on fire, I blushing turn'd and fled. Twelve years have pass'd since I escaped the net, And father, tough as leather, lingers yet, A gray mare rules, the laugh has come to me, I sport, and thank my stars that I am free! If Mysie likes her bargain ill or well, Only the Deil, who won it her, can tell; But she, who could so well his arts pursue, May learn a trick to cheat her Teacher too. THE MINISTER AND THE ELFIN. I. ‘O who among you will win for me The soul of the Preacher of Woodilee? For he prays, he preaches, he labours sore, He cheats me alike of rich and poor, And his cheek is pale with a thought divine, And I would, I would that he were mine?’ ‘O surely I will win for thee The Minister of Woodilee; Round and around the elfin tree, Where we are fleeting in company, The Minister of Woodilee, Laughing aloud, shall dance with me!’ II. The Minister rode in the white moonshine, His face was pale with his thought divine, And he saw beneath the greenwood tree As sweet a maiden as well could be: My hair of gold to my feet fell bright, My eyes were blue, and my brow was white, My cheeks were fresh as the milk of kine Mingled with drops of red red wine, And they shone thro' my veil o' the silk with gleam Like a lover's face thro' a thin light dream; But the sickness of death was in mine ee, And my face was pallid and sad to see, And I moaned aloud as the man came near. And I heard him mutter a prayer in fear! III. But the Minister, when he look'd on me, Leapt down and set my head on his knee, Wet my lips with the running stream, And I open'd my eyes as in a dream, I open'd my eyes and look'd on him, And his head whirl'd round and his cheek grew dim! I kiss'd him twice, I kiss'd him thrice, Till he kiss'd again with lips of ice, Till he kiss'd again with lips of stone, And clasped me close to his cold breastbone; And tho' his face was weary and sad, He laugh'd aloud and seem'd mad, so mad. Then up to my feet I leapt in glee, And round and round and around went we, Under the moonlit greenwood tree! IV. He leapt on his steed and home rode he, The Minister of Woodilee; And when at the door of the manse he rein'd, With blood his lips were damp'd and stain'd, And he pray'd a prayer for his shame and sin, And dropt a tear as he enter'd in, But the smile divine from his face had fled, When he laid him down on his dying bed. V. ‘O thanks, for thou hast won for me The Minister of Woodilee, Who nevermore, O nevermore, Shall preach and pray and labour sore, And cheat me alike of rich and poor, For the smile divine no more wears he— Hasten and bring his soul to me!’ VI. Oh, off I ran his soul to win, And the gray gray manse I enter'd in, And I saw him lying on his bed, With book and candle at his head; But when he turn'd him, weary and weak, A smile and a tear were on his cheek, And he took my hand and kiss'd it thrice, Tho' his lips were clammy cold as ice. ‘O wherefore, wherefore, dost thou One who has stolen thy soul from bliss?’ Then over his face so pale with pain The thought divine came back again, And ‘I love thee more for the shame,’ he said, ‘I love thee more on my dying bed, And I cannot, cannot love thee less, Tho' my heart is wae for its wickedness; I love thee better, I love thee best, Sweet Spirit that errest and wanderest; Colder and colder my blood doth run, I pray for thee, pray for thee, little one!’ Then I heard the bell for the dying toll, And I reach'd out hands to seize his soul, But I trembled and shriek'd to see as he died An angel in white at his bedside! And I fled away to the greenwood tree, Where the elves were fleeting in company, And I hate my immortality, And 'twere better to be a man and dee! VILLAGE VOICES. I. JANUARY WIND. I The wind, wife, the wind; how it blows, how it blows; It grips the latch, it shakes the house, it whistles, it screams, it crows, It dashes on the window-pane, then rushes off with a cry, Ye scarce can hear your own loud voice, it clatters so loud and high; And far away upon the sea it floats with thunder-call, The wind, wife, the wind, wife; the wind that did it all! II The wind, wife, the wind; how it blew, how it blew; The very night our boy was born, it whistled, it scream'd, it crew; And while you moan'd upon your bed, and your heart was dark with fright, I swear it mingled with the soul of the boy you bore that night; It scarcely seems a winter since, and the wind is with us still,— The wind, wife; the wind, wife; the wind that blew us ill! III The wind, wife, the wind; how it blows, how it blows! It changes, shifts, without a cause, it ceases, it comes and goes; And David ever was the same, wayward, and wild, and bold— For wilful lad will have his way, and the wind no hand can hold; But ah! the wind, the changeful wind, was more in the blame than he; The wind, wife; the wind, wife, that blew him out to sea! IV The wind, wife; the wind; now 'tis still, now 'tis still; And as we sit I seem to feel the silence shiver and thrill, 'Twas thus the night he went away, and we sat in silence here, We listen'd to our beating hearts, and all was weary and drear; We long'd to hear the wind again, and to hold our David's hand— The wind, wife; the wind, wife, that blew him out from land! V The wind, wife, the wind; up again, up again! It blew our David round the world, yet shriek'd at our window-pane; And ever since that time, old wife, in rain, and in sun, and in snow, Whether I work or weary here, I hear it whistle and blow, It moans around, it groans around, it comes with scream and cry— The wind, wife; the wind, wife; may it blow him home to die! II. APRIL RAIN. I Showers, showers, nought but showers, and it wants a week of May, Flowers, flowers, summer flowers, are hid in the green and the gray; Green buds and gray shoots cover their sparkling gear, They stir beneath, they long to burst, for the May is so near, so near,— While I spin and I spin, and the fingers of the Rain Fall patter, pitter, patter, on the pane. II Showers, showers, silver showers, murmur and softly sing, Flowers, flowers, summer flowers, are swelling and hearkening; It wants a week of May, when my love and I will be one, The flowers will burst, the birds will sing, as we walk to church in the sun. So patter goes my heart, in a kind of pleasant pain, To the patter, pitter, patter of the Rain. III. SUMMER MOON. I Summer Moon, O Summer Moon, across the west you fly, You gaze on half the earth at once with sweet and steadfast eye; Summer Moon, O Summer Moon, were I aloft with thee, I know that I could look upon my boy who sails at sea. II Summer Moon, O Summer Moon, you throw your silver showers Upon a glassy sea that lies round shores of fruit and flowers, And on the blue tide's silver edge drop blossoms in the breeze, And the shadow of the ship lies dark near shades of orange-trees. III Summer Moon, O Summer Moon, now wind and storm have fled, Your light creeps thro' a cabin-pane and lights a flazen head: He tosses with his lips apart, lies smiling in your gleam, For underneath his folded lids you put a gentle dream. IV Summer Moon, O Summer Moon, his head is on his arm, He stirs with balmy breath and sees the moonlight on the Farm, He stirs and breathes his mother's name, he smiles and sees once more The Moon above, the fields below, the shadow at the door. V Summer Moon, O Summer Moon, across the lift you go, Far south you gaze and see my Boy, where groves of orange grow! Summer Moon, O Summer Moon, you turn again to me, And seem to have the smile of him who sleeps upon the sea! IV. DECEMBER SNOW. I The cold, cold snow! the snow that lies so white! The moon and stars are hidden, there is neither warmth nor light— I wonder, wife—I wonder, wife—where Jeanie lies this night? II 'Tis cold, cold, cold, since Jeanie went away, The world has changed, I sit and wait, and listen night and day, The house is silent, silent, and my hair has grown so gray— 'Tis cold, cold, cold, wife, since Jeanie went away. III And tick! tick! tick! the clock goes evermore, It chills me, wife—it seems to keep our bairn beyond the door; I watch the firelight shadows as they float upon the floor, And tick! tick! tick! wife, the clock goes evermore! IV 'Tis cold, cold, cold!—'twere better she were dead, Not that I heed the Minister, and the bitter things he said,— But to think my lassie cannot find a place to lay her head— 'Tis cold, cold, cold, wife—better she were dead! V The cold, cold snow! the snow that lies so white! Beneath the snow her little one is hidden out of sight, But up above, the wind blows keen, there's neither warmth nor light, I wonder, wife—I wonder, wife—where Jeanie lies this night! London Poems. (1866-70.) Greift nur hinein in's volle Menschenleben! Ein jeder lebt's, nicht vielen ist's bekannt, Und wo ihr's packt, da ist's interessant. Faust — Vorspiel auf dem Theater. BEXHILL, 1866. Now, when the catkins of the hazel swing Wither'd above the leafy nook wherein The chaffinch breasts her five blue speckled eggs, All round the thorn grows fragrant, white with may, And underneath the fresh wild hyacinth-bed Shimmers like water in the whispering wind; Now, on this sweet still gloaming of the spring, Within my cottage by the sea, I sit, Thinking of yonder city where I dwelt, Wherein I sicken'd, and whereof I learn' So much that dwells like music on my brain. A melancholy happiness is mine! My thoughts, like blossoms of the muschatel, Smell sweetest in the gloaming; and I feel Visions and vanishings of other years,— Faint as the scent of distant clover meadows— Sweet, sweet, though they awaken serious cares— Beautiful, beautiful, though they make me weep. The good days dead, the well-belovèd gone Before me, lonely I abode amid The buying, and the selling, and the strife Of little natures; ye there still remain'd Something to thank the Lord for.—I could live! On winter nights, when wind and snow were out, Afford a pleasant fire to keep me warm; And while I sat, with homeward-looking eyes, And while I heard the humming of the town, I fancied 'twas the sound I used to hear In Scotland, when I dwelt beside the sea. I knew not how it was, or why it was, I only heard a sea-sound, and was sad. It haunted me and pain'd me, and it made That little life of penmanship a dream! And yet it served my soul for company, When the dark city gather'd on my brain, And from the solitude came never a voice To bring the good days back, and show my heart It was not quite a solitary thing. The purifying trouble grew and grew, Till silentness was more than I could bear. Brought by the ocean murmur from afar, Came silent phantoms of the misty hills Which I had known and loved in other days; And, ah! from time to time, the hum of life Around me, the strange faces of the streets, Mingling with those thin phantoms of the hills, And with that ocean-murmur, made a cloud That changed around my life with shades and sounds, And, melting often in the light of day, Left on my brow dews of aspiring dream. And then I sang of Scottish dales and dells, And human shapes that lived and moved therein, Made solemn in the shadow of the hills. Thereto, not seldom, did I seek to make The busy life of London musical, And phrase in modern song the troubled lives Of dwellers in the sunless lanes and streets. Yet ever I was haunted from afar, While singing; and the presence of the mountains Was on me; and the murmur of the sea Deepen'd my mood; while everywhere I saw, Flowing beneath the blackness of the streets, The current of sublimer, sweeter life, Which is the source of human smiles and tears, And, melodised, becomes the strength of song. Darkling, I long'd for utterance, whereby Poor people might be holpen, gladden'd, cheer'd; Bright'ning at times, I sang for singing's sake. The wild wind of ambition grew subdued, And left the changeful current of my soul Crystal and pure and clear, to glass like water The sad and beautiful of human life; And, even in the unsung city's streets, Seem'd quiet wonders meet for serious song, Truth hard to phrase and render musical. For ah! the weariness and weight of tears, The crying out to God, the wish for slumber, They lay so deep, so deep! God heard them all; He set them unto music of His own; But easier far the task to sing of kings, Or weave weird ballads where the moon-dew glistens, Than body forth this life in beauteous sound The crowd had voices, but each living man Within the crowd seem'd silence-smit and hard: They only heard the murmur of the town, They only felt the dimness in their eyes, And now and then turn'd startled, when they saw Some weary one fling up his arms and drop, Clay-cold, among them,—and they scarcely grieved, But hush'd their hearts a time, and hurried on. 'Twas comfort deep as tears to sit alone, Haunted by shadows from afar away, And try to utter forth, in tuneful speech, What lay so musically on my heart. But, though it sweeten'd life, it seem'd in vain. For while I sang, much that was clear before— The souls of men and women in the streets, The sounding sea, the presence of the hills, And all the weariness, and all the fret, And all the dim, strange pain for what had fled— Turn'd into mist, mingled before mine eyes, Roll'd up like wreaths of smoke to heaven, and died: The pen dropt from my hand, mine eyes grew dim, And the great roar was in mine ears again, And I was all alone in London streets. Hither to pastoral solitude I came, Happy to breathe again serener air And feel a purer sunshine; and the woods And meadows were to me an ecstasy, The singing birds a glory, and the trees A green perpetual feast to fill the eye And shimmer in upon the soul; but chief, There came the murmur of the waters, sounds Of sunny tides that wash on silver sands, Or cries of waves that anguish'd and went white Under the eyes of lightnings. 'Twas a bliss Beyond the bliss of dreaming, yet in time It grew familiar as my mother's face; And when the wonder and the ecstasy Had mingled with the beatings of my heart, The terrible City loom'd from far away And gather'd on me cloudily, dropping dews, Even as those phantoms of departed days Had haunted me in London streets and lanes. Wherefore in brighter mood I sought again To make the life of London musical, And sought the mirror of my soul for shapes That linger'd, faces bright or agonised, Yet ever taking something beautiful From glamour of green branches, and of clouds That glided piloted by golden airs. And if I list to sing of sad things oft, It is that sad things in this life of breath Are truest, sweetest, deepest. Tears bring forth The richness of our natures, as the rain Sweetens the smelling brier; and I, thank God, Have anguish'd here in no ignoble tears— Tears for the pale friendwith the singing lips, Tears for the father with the gentle eyes (My dearest up in heaven next to God) Who loved me like a woman. I have wrought No garland of the rose and passion-flower, Grown in a careful garden in the sun; But I have gather'd samphire dizzily, Close to the hollow roaring of a Sea. Far away in the dark Breaketh that living Sea, Wave upon wave; and hark! These voices are blown to me; For a great wind rises and blows, Wafting the sea-sound near, But it fitfully comes and goes, And I cannot always hear; Green boughs are flashing around, And the flowers at my feet are fair, And the wind that bringeth the ocean-sound Grows sweet with the country air. THE LITTLE MILLINER; OR, LOVE IN AN ATTIC. With fairy foot and fearless gaze She passes pure through evil ways; She wanders in the sinful town, And loves to hear the deep sea-music Of people passing up and down. Fear nor shame nor sin hath she, But, like a sea-bird on the Sea, Floats hither, thither, day and night: The great black waters cannot harm her, Because she is so weak and light! My girl hath violet eyes and yellow hair, A soft hand, like a lady's, small and fair, A sweet face pouting in a white straw bonnet, A tiny foot, and little boot upon it; And all her finery to charm beholders Is the gray shawl drawn tight around her shoulders, The plain stuff-gown and collar white as snow, And sweet red petticoat that peeps below. But gladly in the busy town goes she, Summer and winter, fearing nobodie; She pats the pavement with her fairy feet, With fearless eyes she charms the crowded street; And in her pocket lie, in lieu of gold, A lucky sixpence and a thimble old. We lodged in the same house a year ago: She on the topmost floor, I just below,— She, a poor milliner, content and wise, I, a poor city clerk, with hopes to rise; And, long ere we were friends, I learnt to love The little angel on the floor above. For, every morn, ere from my bed I stirr'd, Her chamber door would open, and I heard,— And listen'd, blushing, to her coming down, And palpitated with her rustling gown. And tingled while her foot went downward slow, Creak'd like a cricket, pass'd, and died below; Then peeping from the window, pleased and sly, I saw the pretty shining face go by, Healthy and rosy, fresh from slumber sweet,— A sunbeam in the quiet morning street. All winter long, witless who peep'd the while, She sweeten'd the chill mornings with her smile: When the soft snow was falling dimly white, Shining among it with a child's delight, Bright as a rose, though nipping winds might blow, And leaving fairy footprints in the snow! And every night, when in from work she tript, Red to the ears I from my chamber slipt, That I might hear upon the narrow stair Her low ‘Good evening,’ as she pass'd me there. And when her door was closed, below sat I, And hearken'd stilly as she stirr'd on high,— Watch'd the red firelight shadows in the room, Fashion'd her face before me in the gloom, And heard her close the window, lock the door, Moving about more lightly than before, And thought, ‘She is undressing now!’ and oh! My cheeks were hot, my heart was in a glow! And I made pictures of her,—standing bright Before the looking-glass in bed-gown white, Upbinding in a knot her yellow hair, Then kneeling timidly to say a prayer; Till, last, the floor creak'd sofily overhead, 'Neath bare feet tripping to the little bed,— And all was hush'd. Yet still I hearken'd on, Till the faint sounds about the streets were gone; And saw her slumbering with lips apart, One little hand upon her little heart, The other pillowing a face that smiled In slumber like the slumber of a child, The bright hair shining round the small white ear, The soft breath stealing visible and clear, And mixing with the moon's, whose frosty gleam Made round her rest a vaporous light of dream. How free she wander'd in the wicked place, Protected only by her gentle face! She saw bad things—how could she choose but see?— She heard of wantonness and misery; The city closed around her night and day, But lightly, happily, she went her way. Nothing of evil that she saw or heard Could touch a heart so innocently stirr'd,— By simple hopes that cheer'd it through the storm, And little flutterings that kept it warm. No power had she to reason out her needs, To give the whence and wherefore of her deeds; But she was good and pure amid the strife, By virtue of the joy that was her life. Here, where a thousand spirits daily fall, Where heart and soul and senses turn to gall, She floated, pure as innocent could be, Like a small sea-bird on a stormy sea, Which breasts the billows, wafted to and fro, Fearless, uninjured, while the strong winds blow, While the clouds gather, and the waters roar, And mighty ships are broken on the shore. And London streets, with all their noise and stir, Had many a pleasant sight to pleasure her. There were the shops, where wonders ever new, As in a garden, changed the whole year through. Oft would she stand and watch with laughter sweet The Punch and Judy in the quiet street; Or look and listen while soft minuets Play'd the street organ with the marionettes; Or joined the motley group of merry folks Round the street huckster with his wares and jokes. Fearless and glad, she join'd the crowd that flows Along the streets at festivals and shows. In summer time, she loved the parks and squares, Where fine folk drive their carriages and pairs; In winter time her blood was in a glow, At the white coming of the pleasant snow; And in the stormy nights, when dark rain pours, She found it pleasant, too, to sit indoors, And sing and sew, and listen to the gales, Or read the penny journal with the tales. Once in the year, at merry Christmas time, She saw the glories of a pantomime, Feasted and wonder'd, laugh'd and clapp'd aloud, Up in the gallery among the crowd, Gathering dreams of fairyland and fun To cheer her till another year was done; More happy, and more near to heaven, so, Than many a lady in the tiers below. And just because her heart was pure and glad, She lack'd the pride that finer ladies had: She had no scorn for those who lived amiss,— The weary women with their painted bliss; It never struck her little brain, be sure, She was so very much more fine and pure. Softly she pass'd them in the public places, Marvelling at their fearful childish faces; She shelter'd near them, when a shower would fall, And felt a little frighten'd, that was all, And watch'd them, noting as they stood close by Their dress and fine things with a woman's eye, And spake a gentle word if spoken to,— And wonder'd if their mothers lived and knew? Her look, her voice, her step, had witchery And sweetness that were all in all to me! We both were friendless, yet, in fear and doubt, I sought in vain for courage to speak out. Wilder my heart could ne'er have throbb'd before her, My thoughts have stoop'd more humbly to adore her, My love more timid and more still have grown, Had Polly been a queen upon a throne. All I could do was wish and dream and sigh, Blush to the ears whene'er she pass'd me by, Still comforted, although she did not love me, Because—her little room was just above me! 'Twas when the spring was coming, when the snow Had melted, and fresh winds began to blow, And girls were selling violets in the town, That suddenly a fever struck me down. The world was changed, the sense of life was pain'd, And nothing but a shadow-land remain'd; Death came in a dark mist and look'd at me, I felt his breathing, though I could not see, But heavily I lay and did not stir, And had strange images and dreams of her. Then came a vacancy: with feeble breath, I shiver'd under the cold touch of Death, And swoon'd among strange visions of the dead, When a voice call'd from Heaven, and he fled; And suddenly I waken'd, as it seem'd, From a deep sleep wherein I had not dream'd. And it was night, and I could see and hear, And I was in the room I held so dear, And unaware, stretch'd out upon my bed, I hearken'd for a footstep overhead. But all was hush'd. I look'd around the room, And slowly made out shapes amid the gloom. The wall was redden'd by a rosy light, A faint fire flicker'd, and I knew 'twas night, Because below there was a sound of feet Dying away along the quiet street,— When, turning my pale face and sighing low, I saw a vision in the quiet glow: A little figure, in a cotton gown, Looking upon the fire and stooping down, Her side to me, her face illumed, she eyed Two chestnuts burning slowly, side by side,— Her lips apart, her clear eyes strain'd to see, Her little hands clasp'd tight around her knee, The firelight gleaming on her golden head, And tinting her white neck to rosy red, Her features bright, and beautiful, and pure, With childish fear and yearning half demure. Oh, sweet, sweet dream! I thought, and strain'd mine eyes, Fearing to break the spell with words and sighs. Softly she stoop'd, her dear face sweetly fair, And sweeter since a light like love was there, Brightening, watching, more and more elate, As the nuts glow'd together in the grate, Crackling with little jets of fiery light, Till side by side they turn'd to ashes white,— Then up she leapt, her face cast off its fear For rapture that itself was radiance clear, And would have clapp'd her little hands in glee, But, pausing, bit her lips and peep'd at me, And met the face that yearn'd on her so whitely, And gave a cry and trembled, blushing brightly, While, raised on elbow, as she turn'd to flee, ‘Polly!’ I cried,—and grew as red as she! It was no dream!—for soon my thoughts were clear, And she could tell me all, and I could hear: How in my sickness friendless I had lain, How the hard people pitied not my pain; How, in despite of what bad people said, She left her labours, stopp'd beside my bed, And nursed me, thinking sadly I would die; How, in the end, the danger pass'd me by; How she had sought to steal away before The sickness pass'd, and I was strong once more, By fits she told the story in mine ear, And troubled all the telling with a fear Lest by my cold man's heart she should be chid, Lest I should think her bold in what she did; But, lying on my bed, I dared to say, How I had watch'd and loved her many a day, How dear she was to me, and dearer still For that strange kindness done while I was ill, And how I could but think that Heaven above Had done it all to bind our lives in love. And Polly cried, turning her face away, And seem'd afraid, and answer'd ‘yea’ nor ‘nay;’ Then stealing close, with little pants and sighs, Look'd on my pale thin face and earnest eyes, And seem'd in act to fling her arms about My neck, then, blushing, paused, in fluttering doubt, Last, sprang upon my heart, sighing and sobbing,— That I might feel how gladly hers was throbbing! Ah! ne'er shall I forget until I die How happily the dreamy days went by, While I grew well, and lay with soft heartbeats, Heark'ning the pleasant murmur from the streets, And Polly by me like a sunny beam, And life all changed, and love a drowsy dream! 'Twas happiness enough to lie and see The little golden head bent droopingly Over its sewing, while the still time flew, And my fond eyes were dim with happy dew! And then, when I was nearly well and strong, And she went back to labour all day long, How sweet to lie alone with half-shut eyes, And hear the distant murmurs and the cries, And think how pure she was from pain and sin,— And how the summer days were coming in! Then, as the sunset faded from the room, To listen for her footstep in the gloom, To pant as it came stealing up the stair, To feel my whole life brighten unaware When the soft tap came to the door, and when The door was open'd for her smile again! Best, the long evenings!—when, till late at night, She sat beside me in the quiet light, And happy things were said and kisses won, And serious gladness found its vent in fun. Sometimes I would draw close her shining head, And pour her bright hair out upon the bed, And she would laugh, and blush, and try to scold, While ‘Here,’ I cried, ‘I count my wealth in gold!’ Sometimes we play'd at cards, and thrill'd with bliss, On trumping one another with a kiss. And oft our thoughts grew sober and found themes Of wondrous depth in marriage plans and schemes; And she with pretty calculating lips Sat by me, cautious to the finger-tips, Till, all our calculations grown a bore, We summ'd them up in kisses as before! Once, like a little sinner for transgression, She blush'd upon my breast, and made confession: How, when that night I woke and look'd around, I found her busy with a charm profound,— One chestnut was herself, my girl confess'd, The other was the person she loved best, And if they burn'd together side by side, He loved her, and she would become his bride; And burn indeed they did, to her delight,— And had the pretty charm not proven right? Thus much, and more, with timorous joy, she said, While her confessor, too, grew rosy red,— And close together press'd two blissful faces, As I absolved the sinner, with embraces. And here is winter come again, winds blow, The houses and the streets are white with snow; And in the long and pleasant eventide, Why, what is Polly making at my side? What but a silk-gown, beautiful and grand, We bought together lately in the Strand! What but a dress to go to church in soon, And wear right queenly 'neath a honeymoon! And who shall match her with her new straw bonnet, Her tiny foot and little boot upon it, Embroider'd petticoat and silk-gown new, And shawl she wears as few fine iadies do? And she will keep, to charm away all ill, The lucky sixpence in her pocket still! And we will turn, come fair or cloudy weather, To ashes, like the chestnuts, close together! LIZ. The crimson light of sunset falls Through the gray glamour of the murmuring rain, And creeping o'er the housetops crawls Through the black smoke upon the broken pane, Steals to the straw on which she lies, And tints her thin black hair and hollow cheeks, Her sun-tann'd neck, her glistening eyes,— While faintly, sadly, fitfully she speaks. But when it is no longer light, The pale girl smiles, with only One to mark, And dies upon the breast of Night, Like trodden snowdrift melting in the dark. I. Ah, rain, rain, rain! It patters down the glass, and on the sill, And splashes in the pools along the lane— Then gives a kind of shiver, and is still: One likes to hear it, though, when one is ill. Rain, rain, rain, rain! Ah, how it pours and pours! Rain, rain, rain, rain! A dismal day for poor girls out-o'-doors! II. Ah, don't! That sort of comfort makes me cry. And, Parson, since I'm bad, I want to die. The roaring of the street The tramp of feet, The sobbing of the rain, Bring nought but pain; They're gone into the aching of my brain; And whether it be light, Or dark dead night, Wherever I may be, I hear them plain! I'm lost and weak, and can no longer bear To wander, like a shadow, here and there— As useless as a stone—tired out—and sick! So that they put me down to slumber quick, It does not matter where. No one will miss me; all will hurry by, And never cast a thought on one so low; Fine gentlemen miss ladies when they go, But folk care nought for such a thing as I. III. 'Tis bad, I know, to talk like that—too bad! Joe, though he's often hard, is strong and true— And there's the baby, too!— But I'm so tired and sad. I'm glad it was a boy, sir, very glad. A man can fight along, can say his say, Is not look'd down upon, holds up his head, And, at a push, can always earn his bread: Men have the best of it, in many a way. But ah! 'tis hard indeed for girls to keep Decent and honest, tramping in the town,— Their best but bad—made light of—beaten down— Wearying ever, wearying for sleep. If they grow hard, go wrong, from bad to badder, Why, Parson dear, they're happier being blind: They get no thanks for being good and kind— The better that they are, they feel the sadder! IV. Nineteen! nineteen! Only nineteen, and yet so old, so old;— I feel like fifty, Parson—I have been So wicked, I suppose, and life's so cold! Ah, cruel are the wind, and rain, and snow, And I've been out for years among them all: I scarce remember being weak and small Like baby there—it was so long ago. It does not seem that I was born. I woke, One day, long, long ago, in a dark room, And saw the housetops round me in the smoke, And, leaning out, look'd down into the gloom, Saw deep black pits, blank walls, and broken panes, And eyes, behind the panes, that flash'd at me, And heard an awful roaring, from the lanes, Of folk I could not see; Then, while I look'd and listen'd in a dream, I turn'd my eyes upon the housetops gray, And saw, between the smoky roofs, a gleam Of silver water, winding far away. That was the River. Cool and smooth and deep, It glided to the sound o' folk below, Dazzling my eyes, till they began to grow Dusty and dim with sleep. Oh, sleepily I stood, and gazed, and hearken'd! And saw a strange, bright light, that slowly fled, Shine through the smoky mist, and stain it red, And suddenly the water flash'd,—then darken'd; And for a little time, though I gazed on, The river and the sleepy light were gone; But suddenly, over the roofs there lighten'd A pale, strange brightness out of heaven shed, And, with a sweep that made me sick and frighten'd, The yellow Moon roll'd up above my head;— And down below me roar'd the noise o' trade, And ah! I felt alive, and was afraid, And cold, and hungry, crying out for bread. V. All that is like a dream. It don't seem true! Father was gone, and mother left, you see To work for little brother Ned and me; And up among the gloomy roofs we grew,— Lock'd in full oft, lest we should wander out, With nothing but a crust o' bread to eat, While mother char'd for poor folk round about, Or sold cheap odds and ends from street to street. Yet, Parson, there were pleasures fresh and fair, To make the time pass happily up there: A steamboat going past upon the tide, A pigeon lighting on the roof close by, The sparrows teaching little ones to fly, The small white moving clouds, that we espied, And thought were living, in the bit of sky— With sights like these right glad were Ned and I; And then, we loved to hear the soft rain calling, Pattering, pattering, upon the tiles, And it was fine to see the still snow falling, Making the housetops white for miles on miles, And catch it in our little hands in play, And laugh to feel it melt and slip away! But I was six, and Ned was only three, And thinner, weaker, wearier than me; And one cold day, in winter time, when mother Had gone away into the snow, and we Sat close for warmth and cuddled one another, He put his little head upon my knee, And went to sleep, and would not stir a limb, But look'd quite strange and old; And when I shook him, kiss'd him, spoke to him, He smiled, and grew so cold. Then I was frighten'd, and cried out, and none Could hear me; while I sat and nursed his head. Watching the whiten'd window, while the Sun Peep'd in upon his face, and made it red. And I began to sob;—till mother came, Knelt down, and scream'd, and named the good God's name, And told me he was dead. And when she put his night-gown on, and, weeping, Placed him among the rags upon his bed, I thought that brother Ned was only sleeping, And took his little hand, and felt no fear. But when the place grew gray and cold and drear, And the round Moon over the roofs came creeping, And put a silver shade All round the chilly bed where he was laid, I cried, and was afraid. VI. Ah, yes, it's like a dream; for time pass'd by, And I went out into the smoky air, Fruit-selling, Parson — trudging, wet or dry— Winter and summer—weary, cold, and bare. And when old mother laid her down to die, And parish buried her, I did not cry, And hardly seem'd to care; I was too hungry, and too dull; beside, The roar o' streets had made me dry as dust— It took me all my time, howe'er I tried, To keep my limbs alive and earn a crust; I had no time for weeping. And when I was not out amid the roar, Or standing frozen at the playhouse door, Why, I was coil'd upon my straw, and sleeping. Ah, pence were hard to gain! Some girls were pretty, too, but I was plain: Fine ladies never stopp'd and look'd and smiled, And gave me money for my face's sake. That made me hard and angry when a child; But now it thrills my heart, and makes it ache! The pretty ones, poor things, what could they do, Fighting and starving in the wicked town, But go from bad to badder—down, down, down— Being so poor, and yet so pretty, too? Never could bear the like of that—ah, no! Better have starved outright than gone so low! VII. But I've no call to boast. I might have been As wicked, Parson dear, in my distress, But for your friend-you know the one I mean?— The tall, pale lady, in the mourning dress. Though we were cold at first, that wore away— She was so mild and young, And had so soft a tongue, And eyes to sweeten what she loved to say. She never seem'd to scorn me—no, not she; And (what was best) she seem'd as sad as me! Not one of them that make a girl feel base, And call her names, and talk of her disgrace, And frighten one with thoughts of flaming hell, And fierce Lord God with black and angry brow; But soft and mild, and sensible as well; And oh, I loved her, and I love her now. She did me good for many and many a day— More good than pence could ever do, I swear, For she was poor, with little pence to spare— Learn'd me to read, and quit low words, and pray. And, Parson, though I never understood How such a life as mine was meant for good, And could not guess what one so poor and low Would do in that sweet place of which she spoke, And could not feel that God would let me go Into so bright a land with gentlefolk, I liked to hear her talk of such a place, And thought of all the angels she was best, Because her soft voice soothed me, and her face Made my words gentle, put my heart at rest. VIII. Ah, sir! 'twas very lonesome. Night and day, Save when the sweet miss came, I was alone,— Moved on and hunted through the streets of stone, And even in dreams afraid to rest or stay. Then, other girls had lads to work and strive for; I envied them, and did not know 'twas wrong, And often, very often, used to long For some one I could like and keep alive for. Marry? Not they! They can't afford to be so good, you know; But many of them, though they step astray, Indeed don't mean to sin so much, or go Against what's decent. Only—'tis their way. And many might do worsethan that, may be, If they had ne'er a one to fill a thought— It sounds half wicked, but poor girls like me Must sin a little, to be good in aught. IX. So I was glad when I began to see Joe Purvis fancied me; And when, one night, he took me to the play, Over on Surrey side, and offer'd fair That we should take a little room and share Our earnings, why, I could not answer ‘Nay!’ And that's a year ago; and though I'm bad, I've been as true to Joe as girl could be. I don't complain a bit of Joe, dear lad, Joe never, never meant but well to me; And we have had as fair a time, I think, As one could hope, since we are both so low. Joe likes me—never gave me push or blow, When sober: only, he was wild in drink. But then we don't mind beating when a man Is angry, if he likes us and keeps straight, Works for his bread, and does the best he can;— 'Tis being left and slighted that we hate. X. And so the baby's come, and I shall die! And though 'tis hard to leave poor baby here, Where folk will think him bad, and all's so drear, The great Lord God knows better far than I. Ah, don't!—'tis kindly, but it pains me so! You say I'm wicked, and I want to go! ‘God's kingdom,’ Parson dear? Ah nay, ah nay! That must be like the country—which I fear: I saw the country once, one summer day, And I would rather die in London here XI. For I was sick of hunger, cold, and strife, And took a sudden fancy in my head To try the country, and to earn my bread Out among fields, where I had heard one's life Was easier and brighter. So, that day, I took my basket up and stole away, Just after sunrise. As I went along, Trembling and loath to leave the busy place, I felt that I was doing something wrong, And fear'd to look policemen in the face. And all was dim: the streets were gray and wet After a rainy night: and all was still; I held my shawl around me with a chill, And dropt my eyes from every face I met; Until the streets began to fade, the road Grew fresh and clean and wide, Fine houses where the gentlefolk abode, And gardens full of flowers, on every side. That made me walk the quicker-on, on, on— As if I were asleep with half-shut eyes, And all at once I saw, to my surprise, The houses of the gentlefolk were gone, And I was standing still, Shading my face, upon a high green hill, And the bright sun was blazing, And all the blue above me seem'd to melt To burning, flashing gold, while I was gazing On the great smoky cloud where I had dwelt. XII. I'll ne'er forget that day. All was so bright And strange. Upon the grass around my feet The rain had hung a million drops of light; The air, too, was so clear and warm and sweet, It seem'd a sin to breathe it. All around Were hills and fields and trees that trembled through A burning, blazing fire of gold and blue; And there was not a sound, Save a bird singing, singing, in the skies, And the soft wind, that ran along the ground, And blew so sweetly on my lips and eyes, Then, with my heavy hand upon my chest, Because the bright air pain'd me, trembling, sighing, I stole into a dewy field to rest, And oh, the green, green grass where I was lying Was fresh and living—and the bird sang loud, Out of a golden cloud— And I was looking up at him and crying! XIII. How swift the hours slipt on!—and by and by The sun grew red, big shadows fill'd the sky, The air grew damp with dew, And the dark night was coming down, I knew. Well, I was more afraid than ever, then, And felt that I should die in such a place,— So back to London town I turn'd my face, And crept into the great black streets again; And when I breathed the smoke and heard the roar, Why, I was better, for in London here My heart was busy, and I felt no fear. I never saw the country any more. And I have stay'd in London, well or ill— I would not stay out yonder if I could. For one feels dead, and all looks pure and good— I could not bear a life so bright and still. All that I want is sleep, Under the flags and stones, so deep, so deep! God won't be hard on one so mean, but He, Perhaps, will let a tired girl slumber sound There in the deep cold darkness under ground; And I shall waken up in time, may be, Better and stronger, not afraid to see The great, still Light that folds Him round and round! XIV. See! there's the sunset creeping through the pane— How cool and moist it looks amid the rain! I like to hear the splashing of the drops On the house-tops, And the loud humming of the folk that go Along the streets below! I like the smoke and noise—I am so bad— They make a low one hard, and still her cares. . . . There's Joe! I hear his foot upon the stairs!— He must be wet, poor lad! He will be angry, like enough, to find Another little life to clothe and keep. But show him baby, Parson—speak him kind— And tell him Doctor thinks I'm going to sleep. A hard, hard life is his! He need be strong And rough, to earn his bread and get along. I think he will be sorry when I go, And leave the little one and him behind. I hope he'll see another to his mind, To keep him straight and tidy. Poor old Joe! THE STARLING. I. The little lame tailor Sat stitching and snarling— Who in the world Was the tailor's darling? To none of his kind Was he well-inclined, But he doted on Jack the starling. II. For the bird had a tongue, And of words good store, And his cage was hung Just over the door. And he saw the people, And heard the roar,— Folk coming and going Evermore,— And he look'd at the tailor,— And swore. III. From a country lad The tailor bought him,— His training was bad, For tramps had taught him; On alehouse benches His cage had been, While louts and wenches Made jests obscene,— But he learn'd, no doubt, His oaths from fellows Who travel about With kettle and bellows, And three or four, The roundest by far That ever he swore, Were taught by a tar. And the tailor heard— ‘We'll be friends!’ said he, ‘You're a clever bird, And our tastes agree— We both are old, And esteem life base, The whole world cold, Things out of place, And we're lonely too, And full of care— So what can we do But swear? IV. ‘The devil take you, How you mutter!— Yet there's much to make you Swear and flutter. You want the fresh air And the sunlight, lad, And your prison there Feels dreary and sad, And here I frown In a prison as dreary, Hating the town, And feeling weary: We're too confined, Jack, And we want to fly, And you blame mankind, Jack, And so do I! And then, again, By chance as it were, We learn'd from men How to grumble and swear; You let your throat By the scamps be guided, And swore by rote— All just as I did! And without beseeching, Relief is brought us— For we turn the teaching On those who taught us!’ V. A haggard and ruffled Old fellow was Jack, With a grim face muffled In ragged black, And his coat was rusty And never neat, And his wings were dusty With grime of the street, And he sidelong peer'd, With eyes of soot, And scowl'd and sneer'd,— And was lame of a foot! And he long'd to go From whence he came;— And the tailor, you know, Was just the same. VI. All kinds of weather They felt confined, And swore together At all mankind; For their mirth was done, And they felt like brothers, And the swearing of one Meant no more than the other's; 'Twas just a way They had learn'd, you see,— Each wanted to say Only this—‘Woe's me! I'm a poor old fellow, And I'm prison'd so, While the sun shines mellow, And the corn waves yellow And the fresh winds blow,— And the folk don't care If I live or die, But I long for air, And I wish to fly!’ Yet unable to utter it, And too wild to bear, They could only mutter it, And swear. VII. Many a year They dwelt in the city, In their prisons drear, And none felt pity, And few were sparing Of censure and coldness, To hear them swearing With such plain boldness; But at last, by the Lord, Their noise was stopt,— For down on his board The tailor dropt, And they found him dead, And done with snarling, And over his head Still grumbled the Starling; But when an old Jew Claim'd the goods of the tailor, And with eye askew Eyed the feathery railer, And, with a frown At the dirt and rust, Took the old cage down, In a shower of dust,— Jack, with heart aching, Felt life past bearing, And shivering, quaking, All hope forsaking, Died, swearing. JANE LEWSON. Clasping his knee with one soft lady-hand, The other fingering his glass of wine, Black-raimented, white-hair'd, polite, and bland, With mellow voice discourses Doctor Vine: He warms, with deep eyes stirr'd to thoughtful light, And round about his serious talk the while, Kindly, yet pensive—worldly wise, yet bright, Like bloom upon the blackthorn, blows his smile. [I.] Ah, strong and mighty are we mortal men! Braving the whirlwind on a ship at sea, Facing the grim fort's hundred tongues of fire, Ay, and in England, 'neath the olive branch, Pushing a stubborn elbow through the crowd, To get among the heights that keep the gold; But there is might and might,—and in the one Our dames and daughters shame us. Come, my friend, My man of sinews,—conscious of your strength, Proud of your well-won wrestles with the world,— Hear what a feeble nature can endure! A little yellow woman, dress'd in black, With weary crow's-feet crawling round the eyes, And solemn voice, that seem'd a call to prayer; Another yellow woman, dress'd in black, Sad, too, and solemn, yet with bitterness Burn'd in upon the edges of her lips, And sharper, thinner, less monotonous voice; And last, a little woman auburn-hair'd, Pensive a little, but not solemnised, And pretty, with the open azure eyes, The white soft cheek, the little mindless mouth, The drooping childish languor. There they dwelt, In a great dwelling of a smoky square In Islington, named by their pious friends, And the lean Calvinistic minister— The Misses Lewson, and their sister Jane. Miss Sarah, in her twenty-seventh year, Knew not the warmer passions of her sex, But groan'd both day and night to save her soul; Miss Susan, two years younger, had regrets Her sister knew not, and a secret pain Because her heart was withering—whence her tongue Could peal full sharp at times, and show a sting; But Jane was comely—might have cherish'd hopes, Since she was only twenty, had her mind Been hopefuller. The elders ruled the house. Obedience and meekness to their will Was a familiar habit Jane had learn'd Full early, and had fitted to her life So closely, 'twas a portion of her needs. She gazed on them, as Eastern worshippers Gaze on a rayless picture of the sun. Her acts seem'd other than her own; her heart Kept melancholy time to theirs; her eyes Look'd ever unto them for help and light; Her eyelids droop'd before them if they chid. A woman weak and dull, yet fair of face! Her mother, too, had been a comely thing— A bright-hair'd child wed to an aged man, A heart that broke because the man was hard,— Not like the grim first wife, who brought the gold, And yielded to his melancholy kiss The melancholy virgins. Well, the three, Alone in all the world, dwelt in the house Their father left them, living by the rents Of certain smaller houses of the poor. And they were stern to wring their worldly dues— Not charitable, since the world was base, But cold to all men, save the minister, Who weekly cast the darkness of his blessing Over their chilly table. All around The life of London shifted like a cloud, Men sinned, and women fell, and childien cried, And Want went ragged up and down the lanes; While the two hueless sisters dragg'd their chain Self-woven, pinch'd their lives complexionless, Keeping their feelings quiet, hard, and pure. But Jane felt lonesome in the world; and oft, Pausing amid her work, gazed sadly forth Upon the dismal square of wither'd trees, The dusty grass that grew within the rails, The garden-plots where here and there a flower Grew up, and sicken'd in the smoke, and died; And when the sun was on the square, and sounds Came from the children in the neighbouring streets, She thought of happy homes among the fields, And brighter faces. When she walk'd abroad, The busy hum of life oppress'd her heart And frighten'd her: she did not raise her eyes, But stole along,—a sweet shape clad in black, A pale and pretty face, at which the men Stared vacant admiration. Far too dull To blame her gloomy sisters for the shape Her young days took, she merely knew the world Was drear; and if at times she dared to dream Of things that made her colour come and go, And dared to hope for cheerier, sunnier days, She grew the wanner afterwards, and felt Sad and ashamed. The dull life that she wore, Like to a gloomy garment, day by day, Was a familiar life, the only life She clearly understood. Coldly she heard The daily tale of human sin and wrong, And the small thunders of the Sunday nights In chapel. All around her were the streets, And frightful sounds, and gloomy sunless faces. And thus with tacit dolour she resign'd Her nature to the hue upon the cheeks Of her cold sisters. Yet she could not pray As they pray'd, could not wholly feel and know The blackness of mankind, her own heart's sin; But when she tried to get to God, and yearn'd For help not human, she could only cry, Feeling a loveless and a useless thing, Thinking of those sweet places in the fields, Those homes whereon the sun shone pleasantly, And happy mothers sat at cottage doors Among their children. Save for household work, She would have wasted soon. From week to week The burthen lay on her,—the gloomy twain Being too busy searching for their souls, And begging God above to spare the same. Yet she was quiet thus, content and glad To silent drudgery, such as saved her heart From wilder flutterings. The Sabbath day Was drearest: drest in burial black, she sat Those solemn hours in chapel, listening, And scarcely heeding what she heard, but watching The folk around, their faces and their dress, Or gazing at the sunshine on the floor; And service over, idly pined at home, And, looking from the window at the square, Long'd for the labour of the coming day. Her sisters watch'd her warily, be sure; And though their hearts were pure as pure could be, They loved her none the better for her face. Love is as cunning as disease or death, No doctor's skill will ward him off or cure, And soon he found this pale and weary girl, Despite the cloud of melancholy life That rain'd around her. In no beauteous shape, In guise of passionate stripling iris-eyed, Such as our poets picture in their songs, Love came;—but in a gloomy garb of one Whom men call'd pious, and whose holy talk Disarm'd the dragons. 'Twere but idle, friend, To count the wiles by which he won his way Into her heart; how she vouchsafed him all The passion of a nature not too strong; How, when the first wild sunshine dazzled her, The woman loved so blindly, that her thoughts Became a secret trouble in the house; And how at last, with white and frighten'd face, She glided out into the dark one night, And vanish'd with no utterance of farewell. The sisters gave a quick and scandall'd cry, And sought a little for the poor flown bird; Then, thinking awful things, composed their hearts In silence, pinch'd their narrow nat res more, And waited. ‘This is something strange,’ they thought, ‘Which God will clear; we will not think the worst, Although she was a thing as light as straw.’ Nor did they cry their fear among their friends, Hawking a secret shame, but calmly waited, Trusting no stain would fall upon their chill And frosty reputations. Weeks pass'd by; They pray'd, they fasted, yellowing more and more, They waited sternly for the end, and heard The timid knock come to the door at last. It was a dark and rainy night; the streets Were gleaming watery underneath the lamps, The dismal wind scream'd fitfully without, And made within a melancholy sound; And the faint knock came to the door at last. The sisters look'd in one another's faces, And knew the wanderer had returned again, But spoke not; and the younger sister rose, Open'd the door, peer'd out into the rain, And saw the weary figure shivering there, Holding a burthen underneath her shawl. And silently, with wan and timid look, The wanderer slipt in. No word of greeting Spake either of the sisters, but their eyes Gleam'd sharply, and they waited. White and cold, Her sweet face feebly begging for a word, Her long hair dripping loose and wet, stood Jane Before them, shivering, clasping tight her load, In the dull parlour with the cheerless fire. Till Susan, pointing, cried in a shrill voice, ‘What are you carrying underneath your shawl, Jane Lewson?’ and the faint despairing voice, While the rain murmur'd and the night-wind blew, Moan'd, ‘It's my Baby!’ and could say no more, For the wild sisters scream'd and raised their hands, And Jane fell quivering down upon her knees, The old shawl opening show'd a child asleep, And, trebling terror with a piteous cry, The child awaken'd. Pointing to the door, With twitching lips of venom, Susan said— ‘Go!’ and the elder sister echo'd her More sadly and more solemnly. But Jane, Clinging to Sarah's skirts, implored and moan'd, ‘Don't turn me out! my little girl will die! I have no home in all the world but here; Kill me, but do not drive from the house!’ ‘Jane Lewson,’ Susan cried, as white as death, ‘Where is the father o this child?’ and Jane Moan'd, ‘Gone, gone, gone;’ and when she named his name, And how, while she who spake in sickness lay, He secretly had fled across the seas, They shiver'd to the hair. Holding her hand Upon her heart, the elder sister spake In dull monotonous voice—‘Look up! look up! Perhaps 'tis not so ill as we believed. Are you a wedded woman?’ The reply Was silentness and heavy drooping eyes, Yet with no blush around the quivering lids; And Sarah, freezing into ice, spake on In dull monotonous voice—‘Your sin has brought Shame on us all, but they who make their beds Must sleep upon them; go away, bad woman! The third of what our father left is yours, But you are not our sister any more.’ Still moaning, shuddering, the girl begg'd on, Nor ceased to rock the babe and still its cries, ‘Kill me, but do not drive me from the house! Put any pain upon me that you please, But do not, do not, drive me forth again Into the dreadful world! I have no friends On all the earth save you!’ The sisters look'd At one another, and without a word Walk'd from the room. Jane sat upon the floor, Soothing the child, and did not rise, but waited; The agony and terror dried her tears, And she could only listen, praying God That He would soften them; and the little one Look'd in her face and laugh'd. A weary hour Pass'd by, and then, still white, and stern, and cold, The sisters enter'd, and the elder one Spake without prelude: ‘We have talk'd it o'er, Jane Lewson, and have settled how to act; You have a claim upon us: will you take The third of what our father left, and find Another home?’ But Jane cried, ‘Do not, do not, Drive me away; I have no friends save you; And I am sorry.’ Trembling, for her heart Was not all cold, the elder icicle Resumed: ‘Take what is left you, and be gone, And never see our faces any more; Or if you will, stay with us here, but only On these conditions: For the infant's sake, And for the sake of our good name, our friends Must never know the miserable child Is yours; but we will have it given out That, being lonely and unwedded here, We have adopted a poor tenant's child, With view to bring it up in godliness.’ Jane answer'd, with a feeble thrill of hope, ‘Anything, anything,—only leave me not Alone in the dark world.’ ‘Peace!’ Susan said, ‘You do not understand: the child herself Must never know Jane Lewson is her mother: Neither by word nor look nor tender folly, Must you reveal unto the child her shame, And yours, and ours!’ Then, with a bitter cry, And a wild look, Jane cried, ‘And must my babe Not know me?’ ‘Never,’ Sarah Lewson said: ‘For the babe's sake, for yours, for ours, the shame Must not be utter'd. See, you have your choice: Take what our father gave you, and depart, Or stay on these conditions. We are firm. We have decided kindly, not forgetting You were our sister, nor that this poor child Is blameless, save that all the flesh is sin, But not forgetting, either, what we owe To God above us.’ Weeping o'er the child, Not rising yet, Jane answer'd, ‘I will stay; Yes, gladly, for the little baby's sake, That folk may never call it cruel names.’ And the stern sisters took from off the shelf The great old Bible, placed it in her hands And made her kiss it, swearing before God Never to any one in all the world, Not even to the child itself, to tell She was its sinful mother. Wild and dazed, She sware upon the Book. ‘That is enough,’ Said Sarah; ‘but, Jane Lewson, never again Speak to us of the evil that has pass'd; Live with us as you used to do, and ask The grace of God, who has been kinder far Than you deserved.’ Thus, friend, these icicles Dealt their hard measure, deeming that they did A virtuous and a righteous deed; and Jane, The worn and mindless woman, sank again Into submission and house-drudgery, Comforted that she daily saw her child, And that her shame was hidden from the world, And that the child would never suffer scorn Because a sinner bore it. But her heart Was a bruised reed, the little sunny hue Had gone from all things; and whene'er she pray'd, She thought the great cold God above her head Dwelt on a frosty throne and did not hear. II. Yet He, the Almighty Lord of this our breath, Did see and hear, and surely pitied too, If God can pity,—but He works as God, Not man, and so we cannot understand. No whisper of reproach, no spoken word, Troubled with memories of her sinfulness The suffering woman; yet her daily life Became a quiet sorrow. In the house She labour'd with her hands from morn to night, Seeing few faces save the pensive ones Whose yellow holiness she bow'd before; And tacitly they suffer'd her to sink Into the household drudge.—with privilege Upon the Sabbath day to dress in black, Sit in the sunless house or go to prayer,— So idle, that her thoughts could travel back To shame and bitterness. Her only joy Was when she gave her little girl the breast, (They dared not rob her weary heart of that,) When, seated all alone, she felt it suck, And, as the little lips drew forth the milk, Felt drowsily resign'd, and closed her eyes, And trembled, and could feel the happy tears. There came a quiet gathering in the house, And by the gloomy minister the child Was christen'd; and the name he gave to her Was ‘Margaret Lewson.’ For the sisters said, ‘Her mother being buried, as it were, The girl shall take our name.’ And Jane sat by, And heard the pious lie with aching heart, And ever after that her trouble grew. Soon, when the sound of little feet were heard In the dull dwelling, and a baby-voice Call'd at the mother's heart, Jane thrill'd and heard, But even as she listen'd the sweet sounds Would seem to die into the cloud that hid The great cold God above her. Margaret Grew to a little wildling, quick and bright, Black-eyed, black-hair'd, and passionate and quick, Not like its mother; fierce and wild when chid, So that the gloomy sisters often thought, ‘There is a curse upon it;’ yet they grew To love the little wildling unaware, Indulged it in their stern and solemn way, More cheer'd than they believed by its shrill laugh Within the dismal dwelling. But the child Clung most to Jane, and though, when first it learn'd To call her by her Christian name, the sound Bruised the poor suffering heart, that wore away; And all the little troubles of the child, The pretty joys, the peevish fits, the bursts Of passion, work'd upon her nature so, That all her comfort was to snatch it up, And cover it with kisses secretly. Wilful and passionate, yet loving too, Grew Margaret,—an echo in a cave Of human life without; clinging to Jane, Who never had the heart to fondle it Before her sisters; not afraid at times To pinch the thin, worn arms, or pull the hairs Upon the aching head, but afterwards Curing the pain with kisses and with tears. So that as time wore on the mother's heart Grew tenderer to its trouble than before. Then later, when the little girl went forth To school hard by, the motion and the light Hied from the house; and all the morning hours The thin face came and went against the panes, Looking out townward,—till the little shape Appear'd out of the cloud, and pale eyes grew Dim to its coming. As the years went on, The mother, with the agony in her heart She could not utter, quietly subdued Her nature to a listening watchfulness: Her face grew settled to expectant calm, Her vision penetrated things around And gazed at something lying far beyond, Her very foot linger'd about the house, As if she loiter'd hearkening for a sound Out of the world. For Margaret, as she grew, Was wilder and more wilful, openly Master'd the gloomy virgins, and escaped The pious atmosphere they daily breathed To gambol in a freër, fresher air; And Jane would think, ‘'Twill kill me, if my child Should turn out wicked.’ Mindless though she was, And feeble, yet the trouble made her sense Quick, sharp, and subtle to perceive and watch. A little word upon the girlish tongue Could sting her,—nay, a light upon the face, A kindling of the eye, a look the child Wore when asleep, would trouble her for days, Carrying strangest import. So she waited, Watching and listening,—while the young new life Drew in the air, and throve, absorbing hues Out of a thousand trivial lights and shades That hover'd lightly round it. Still to Jane The habit of submission clung: she watch'd The wiser sterner faces oftentimes, Trembling for confirmation of her fears; And nightly pray'd that God, who was so just, So hard to those who went astray at all, Would aid her sisters, helping them to make The little Margaret better as she grew,— Waking her secret trouble evermore With countless, nameless acts of help and love, And humble admonition,—comforted By secret fondlings of the little arms, Or kisses on the tiny, wilful mouth Apart in childish slumber. Thus the years Pass'd over her like pensive clouds, and melted Into that dewy glimmer on the brain, Which men call Memory. Wherefore recount The little joys and sorrows of the time: The hours when sickness came, and thought itself Tick'd like a death-watch,—all the daily hopes And impulses and fears? Enough to tell, That all went onward like a troubled stream, Until the sisters, worn and growing old, Felt the still angel coming nearer, nearer, Scattering sleep-dust on uplooking eyes; And Jane, though in her prime, was turning gray; And Margaret was a maiden flower fullblown. A passion-flower!—a maiden whose rich heart Burn'd with intensest fire that turn'd the light Of the sweet eyes into a warm dark dew; One of those shapes so marvellously made, Strung so intensely, that a finger-press, The dropping of a stray curl unaware Upon the naked breast, a look, a tone, Can vibrate to the very roots of life, And draw from out the spirit light that seems To scorch the tender cheeks it shines upon; A nature running o'er with ecstasy Of very being, an appalling splendour Of animal sensation, loveliness Like to the dazzling panther's; yet, withal, The gentle, wilful, clinging sense of love, Which makes a virgin's soul. It seem'd, indeed, The gloomy dwelling and the dismal days, Gloaming upon her heart, had lent this show Of shining life a melancholy shade That trebled it in beauty. Such a heart Needed no busy world to make it beat: It could throb burningly in solitude; Since kindly Heaven gave it strength enough To rock the languid blood into the brains Of twenty smaller natures. Then the pain, The wonder, deepen'd on the mother's heart,— Her mother, her worn mother, whom she knew not To be her mother. As she might have watch'd A wondrous spirit from another world, Jane Lewson watch'd her child. Could this fair girl,— This wild and dazzling life, be born of her?— A lightning flash struck from a pensive cloud The wan still moon is drinking? Like a woman Who has been sick in darkness many days, And steps into the sunshine, Jane beheld Her daughter, and felt blind. A terror grew Upon her, that the smother'd sense of pride Lack'd power to kill. She pray'd, she wept, she dream'd, And thought, if Margaret's had been a face More like the common faces of the streets, 'Twould have been better. With this feeling, grew The sense of her own secret. Oftentimes A look from Margaret brought the feeble blush Into the bloodless cheek;—creeping away Into her chamber, Jane would wring her hands, Moaning in pain, ‘God help me! If she knew! Ah, if she knew!’ And then for many days Would haunt the dwelling fearfully, afraid To look on what she loved,—till once again, Some little kindness, some sweet look or tone, A happy kiss, would bring her courage back And cheer her. Nor had Margaret fail'd to win The hard-won sisters; oft their frosty eyes Enlarged themselves upon her and grew thaw'd— In secret she was mistress over both— And in their loveless way, they also felt A frighten'd pleasure in the beauteous thing That brighten'd the dull dwelling. Oftentimes, The fiery maiden-nature flashing forth In wilful act or speech or evil looks, Deepen'd Jane's terror. Margaret heeded not The sisters' pious teachings, did not show A godly inclination,—nay, at times Mock'd openly. Ah, had she guess'd the pain, The fear, the agony, such mockings gave Her mother, her worn mother, whom she knew not To be her mother! In her secret heart Jane deem'd her own deep sorrows all had come Because she had not, in her dreary youth, Been godly; and as such flashes as she saw Gleam from her girl, seem'd wicked things indeed; And at such times the weary woman's eyes Would seek the sunless faces, searching them For cheer or warning. In its season came That light which takes from others what it gives To him or her who, standing glorified, Awaits it. 'Tis the old, sad mystery: No gift of love that comes upon a life But means another's loss. The new sweet joy, That play'd in tender colours and mild fire On Margaret's cheek, upon the mother's heart Fell like a firebrand. For to Jane, her friend, Her dearest in the household from the first, Her mother, her worn mother, whom she knew not To be her mother, Margaret first told The terror—how she loved and was beloved; And seated at Jane's feet, with eyes upturn'd, Playing with the worn fingers, she exclaim'd, ‘I love him, Jane! and you will love him too! I will not marry any other man!’ And suddenly Jane felt as if the Lord Had come behind her in the dark and breathed A burning fire upon her. For she thought, ‘My child will go away, and I shall die!’ But only murmur'd, ‘Marry, Margaret? You are too young to marry!’—and her face Was like a murder'd woman's. And the pain, The agony, deepen'd, when the lover's face Came smiling to the dwelling, young and bright With pitiless gladness. Jane was still, and moan'd, ‘My child will go away, and I shall die!’ And look'd upon her sisters, and could see They pitied her; but their stetn faces said, ‘This is God's will! the just God governs all! How should we cross such love?’ adding, ‘Beware,— For our sakes, for your own, but chief of all For her sake whom you love, remember now! Pray, and be silent!’ And the wounded heart Cried up to God again, and from the sky No answer came; when, crush'd beneath her pain, The woman sicken'd, lay upon her bed, And thought her time was come. Most tenderly Her daughter nursed her; little fathoming The meaning of the wild and yearning look That made the white face sweet and beautiful; For Jane was saying, ‘Lord, I want to die! My child would leave me, or my useless life Would turn a sorrow to her, if I stay'd: Lord, let me die!’ Yea, the dull nature clung Still into silence, with the still resolve Of mightier natures. Thinking she would die, Jane lay as in a painless dream, and watch'd The bright face stir around her, following The shape about the room, and praying still For strength—so happy in her drowsy dream, That she went chill at times, and felt that thoughts So tranquil were a sin. A darker hour Gloam'd soon upon her brain. She could not see The face she loved; murmur'd delirious words; And in the weary watches of the night, Moaning and wringing hands, with closèd eyes, Cried ‘Margaret! Margaret!’ Then the sisters sought To lead the girl away, lest she should hear The secret; but she conquer'd, and remain'd; And one still evening, when the quiet fire Was making ghosts that quiver'd on the floor To the faint time-piece ticking, Jane awoke, Gazed long and strangely at the shining face, Waved her thin arms, cried, ‘Margaret! Margaret! Where are you, Margaret? Have you gone away? Come to your mother!’ The wild cry of pain Startled the maiden, but she only thought The fever'd woman raved. Twining her arms Around Jane's neck, she murmur'd, ‘I am here!’ Weeping and kissing; but the woman sigh'd And shiver'd, crying feebly, ‘Let me die! My little girl has gone into the town, And she has learn'd to call me wicked names, And will not come again!’ When, wearied out, Jane sank to troubled sleep, her child sat still, Thinking of those strange words; and though at last She shut them from her thought as idle dream, Their pain return'd upon her. The next day She spake unto the sisters of the same, Adding, in a low voice, ‘She talk'd of me, And moan'd out loudly for a little child— Has she a child?’ The first quick flash of fear Died from the yellow visages unseen, And they were calm. ‘Delirium!’ Sarah said; ‘But you, my child, must watch her sickbed less— You are too young, too weak, to bear such things.’ And this time Margaret did not say a word, But yielded, thinking, ‘It is very strange!— There is a mystery, and I will watch: Can Jane have had a child?’ That very day The dark mists roll'd from the sick woman's brain, And she awoke, remembering nought, and saw The sisters watching her. Two days they watch'd; And spake but very little, though they saw The wan eyes wander with a hungry look, Seeking the face they loved. Then Sarah took Jane's hand, and spake more gently, sisterly, (Such natures, friend, grow kinder as they age,) Than she had done for many years, and told Of those wild words utter'd while she was ill; Jane moan'd and hid her face; but Sarah said, ‘We do not blame you, and perchance the Lord Spake through you! We have thought it o'er, and pray'd: Now listen, Jane. Since that unhappy night, We have not spoken of your shame, yet know You have repented.’ With her face still hid, Jane falter'd, ‘Let me die!’ but Sarah said, ‘We do not think, Jane Lewson, you will live; So mark me well. If, ere you go away, You feel that you could go more cheerfully, If you are certain that it is not sin, Poor Margaret shall know she is your child; We will not, now you die, deny you this; And Margaret will be silent of the shame,— And, lest you break your oath upon the Word, Our lips shall tell her.’ Still Jane Lewson hid Her face; and all was quiet in the room, Save for a shivering sound and feeble crying. But suddenly Jane lifted up her face, Beauteous beyond all beauty given to joy, And quickly whispering, press'd the chilly hand— ‘I will not speak! I will not hurt my child So cruelly!—the child shall never know! And I will go in silence to my grave, Leaving her happy,—and perhaps the Lord Will pardon me!’ Then, for the first last time, The sisters look'd on Jane with different eyes, Admiring sternly, with no words of praise, Her they had scorn'd for feebleness so long. Even then the watchers in the chamber heard A sound that thrill'd them through,—a rustling dress, A deep hard breathing as of one in pain; And pointing with her hand Jane scream'd aloud; And turning suddenly the sisters saw A face as white as marble, yet illumed By great eyes flashing with a terrible flame That made them quail. And in a dangerous voice, As low as a snake's hissing, Margaret said, ‘I have heard all!’ Then the great eyes were turn'd On Jane, and for a moment they were cold; But all at once the breathless agony Of recognition struck upon her heart, The bosom heaved and moan'd, the bright tears burst, And Margaret flung herself upon the bed, Clasping her shivering mother; and at first Jane shrank away,—but soon the wondrous love Master'd her,—she could smile and kiss and cry— And hear the dear wild voice cry, ‘Mother, mother!’ And see the bright face through her tears, and feel That Love was there. After the first strange bliss Of meeting, both were stiller. Jane could weep, And bear to feel so happy. Margaret Clang to her mother, breathed her bliss upon her, Fondling the silver'd tresses, covering The thin hard hand with kisses and with tears, Trying to say a thousand merry things That died in sobs and tears, and only saying, For all the utterance of her speechful heart, ‘Mother, my mother!’ Suddenly her shame Came back upon the woman, and she turn'd To seek her sisters' faces piteously, But they had stolen from the happy room; Whereon again she murmur'd, ‘Let me die! I am a wicked woman, Margaret! Why did you listen?’ But a second burst Of love and blissful pain, and bitter things Hurl'd at the cruel sisters, answer'd her; And more tears flow'd, and more fond kisses brush'd The tears away,—until at last Jane cried, ‘Dear, I could go away not weeping now— God is so gentle with me!’ But He, who drew Thus from His cloud at last and look'd so kind, Will'd that Jane Lewson should not die so soon. The agony did not kill her, and the joy Sent a fresh life into her languid blood And saved her. So that soon she rose from bed, To see the sunshine on her daughter's face, To see the sunless sisters, who again Look'd cold as ever. But a burning fire From Margaret scorch'd them to the heart, because They loved the girl; she heap'd upon their heads Rage and reproaches, mockery and scorn, Until they cried, ‘You are a wicked girl! Jane Lewson's shame is on you. After this We cannot dwell together any more.’ And Margaret would have answer'd fiercelier still, But that her feeble mother, piteously Gazing at them to whom in spite of all Her heart was humble, begg'd her on her knees For silence; and, thus conquer'd, Margaret Answer'd her aunts with kisses and with tears Shower'd on her mother's face. That evening, Margaret held her mother round the neck, And led her to her lover in the house, And with her lips set firm together, saying, ‘This is my dear, dear mother,’ told him all, Concealing nothing. For a time, the man Look'd startled and appall'd; but being made Of clay not base, he smiling spake at last, And stooping softly, kiss'd the thin worn hand— ‘She is my mother, too,—and we will dwell Together!’ And they dwelt together,—leaving The dismal dwelling in the smoky square, To dwell within a cottage close to town; But Jane lived with them only for a year, And then, because the heart that had been used To suffering so long could not endure To be so happy, died; worn out and tired, Kissing her child; and as her dying thoughts Went back along the years, the suffering seem'd Not such a thankless suffering after all, But like a faded garment one has learn'd To love through habit;—and the woman cried On her stern sisters with her dying breath. LANGLEY LANE. A LOVE POEM. In all the land, range up, range down, Is there ever a place so pleasant and sweet, As Langley Lane, in London town, Just out of the bustle of square and street? Little white cottages, all in a row, Gardens, where bachelors'-buttons grow, Swallows' nests in roof and wall, And up above the still blue sky, Where the woolly-white clouds go sailing by,— I seem to be able to see it all! For now, in summer, I take my chair, And sit outside in the sun, and hear The distant murmur of street and square, And the swallows and sparrows chirping near; And Fanny, who lives just over the way, Comes running many a time each day, With her little hand's-touch so warm and kind; And I smile and talk, with the sun on my cheek, And the little live hand seems to stir and speak,— For Fanny is dumb and I am blind. Fanny is sweet thirteen, and she Has fine black ringlets, and dark eyes clear, And I am older by summers three,— Why should we hold one another so dear? Because she cannot utter a word, Nor hear the music of bee or bird, The water-cart's splash, or the milkman's call. Because I have never seen the sky, Nor the little singers that hum and fly,— Yet know she is gazing upon them all. For the sun is shining, the swallows fly, The bees and the blue-flies murmur low, And I hear the water-cart go by, With its cool splash-splash down the dusty row; And the little one, close at my side, perceives Mine eyes upraised to the cottage eaves, Where birds are chirping in summer shine, And I hear, though I cannot look, and she, Though she cannot hear, can the singers see,— And the little soft fingers flutter in mine. Hath not the dear little hand a tongue, When it stirs on my palm for the love of me? Do I not know she is pretty and young? Hath not my soul an eye to see? 'Tis pleasure to make one's bosom stir, To wonder how things appear to her, That I only hear as they pass around; And as long as we sit in the music and light, She is happy to keep God's sight, And I am happy to keep God's sound. Why, I know her face, though I am blind— I made it of music long ago: Strange large eyes, and dark hair twined Round the pensive light of a brow of snow; And when I sit by my little one, And hold her hand, and talk in the sun, And hear the music that haunts the place, I know she is raising her eyes to me, And guessing how gentle my voice must be, And seeing the music upon my face. Though, if ever Lord God should grant me a prayer, (I know the fancy is only vain,) I should pray: Just once, when the weather is fair, To see little Fanny and Langley Lane; Though Fanny, perhaps, would pray to hear The voice of the friend that she holds so dear, The song of the birds, the hum of the street,— It is better to be as we have been,— Each keeping up something, unheard, unseen, To make God's heaven more strange and sweet. Ah! life is pleasant in Langley Lane! There is always something sweet to hear; Chirping of birds, or patter of rain; And Fanny, my little one, always near; And though I am weak, and cannot live long, And Fanny, my darling, is far from strong, And though we can never married be,— What then?—since we hold one another so dear, For the sake of the pleasure one cannot hear, And the pleasure that only one can see? EDWARD CROWHURST; OR, ‘A NEW POET.’ I. Potts, in his dusty chamber, writes, A dilettante lord to please: A ray of country sunshine lights The foggy region ruled by these; Flock, kind advisers, critics sage, To damn the simple country clown,— The mud of English patronage Grows round his feet, and keeps him down. ‘This little mean-faced duodecimo, “Poems by Edward Crowhurst, Labourer,” This coarsely-printed little book of rhymes, Contains within the goodliest gift of song The gods have graced us with for many a day: A crystal clearness, as of running brooks. A music, as of green boughs murmuring, A peeping of fresh thoughts in shady places Like violets new-blown, a gleam of dew drops, A sober, settled, greenness of repose,— And lying over all, in level beams, Transparent, sweet, and unmistakable, The light that never was on sea or land. ‘Let all the greater and the lesser lights Regard these lines upon a Wood in Spring, Or those which follow, call'd “the Barley-Bird,” And then regard their laurels. Melody More sweet was never blown through pastoral pipe In Britain, since the Scottish Ramsay died. Nor let the squeamish dreamers of our time, Our rainbow bards, despise such song as this, Wealthy in images the poor man knows, And household chords that make the women weep. Simply yet subtly, Edward Crowhurst works: Singing of lowly truths and homely things— Death snatching up a cotter's child at play, Light flashing from far worlds on dying eyes That never saw beyond their native fields, The pathos and the power of common life; And while, perchance, his deeper vein runs on Less heeded, by a random touch is waken'd A scent, a flowër-tint, a wave of wings, A sense of rustling boughs and running brooks, Touch'd by whose spell the soul is stirr'd, and eyes Gaze on the dark world round them, and are dim. ‘This Mister Crowhurst is a poor young man, Uneducated, doom'd to earn his bread By working daily at the plough; and yet, Sometimes in midst of toil, sometimes at night, Whenever he could snatch a little time, Hath written down (he taught himself to write!) His simple verses. Is it meet, we ask, A nature so superb should languish thus? Nay, he deserves, if ever man deserved, The succour of the rich and high in place, The opportunity to labour less, And use those truly wondrous gifts of his In modest competence; and therewithal, Kindness, encouragement, and good advice, Such as the cultured give. Even now, we hear, A certain sum of money is subscribed, Enough to furnish well his present needs. Among the donors, named for honour here, We note the noble Earl of Chremiton, Lord Phidippus, Lord Gnathos, Lady Dee, Sir Charles Toroon. But more must yet be done. We dare to put the case on public grounds, Since he who writes so nobly is, indeed, A public benefactor,—with a claim On all who love to listen and to look, When the fresh Saxon Muse, in homespun gear, The free breeze blowing back her loosen'd hair, Wanders barefooted through the dewy lanes And sings aloud, till all the valleys ring For pleasure, and the echoes of the hills Make sweet accord!’ —Conservative Review. II. After Ten Years. A homely matron, who has once been fair, In quiet suffering old, yet young in years; Soft threads of silver in her auburn hair, And lines around the eyes that tell of tears; But on her face there trembles peaceful light, That seems a smile, and yet is far less bright,— To tell of watchings in the shade and sun, And melancholy duty sweetly done. What, take away my Teddy? shut him up Between stone walls, as if he was a thief? You freeze my blood to talk of such a thing! Why, these green fields where my old man was born, The river, and the woodland, and the lanes, Are all that keep him living: he was ever O'er fond of things like those; and now, you see, Is fonder of them than he was before, Because he thinks so little else is left. Mad? He's a baby! Would not hurt a fly! Can manage him as easy as our girl! And though he was a poet and went wrong, He could not help his failings. Ah, True Heart, I love him all the deeper and the dearer! I would not lose him for the whole wide world! It came through working lonely in the fields, And growing shy of cheerful company, And worrying his wits with idle things He saw and heard when quiet out o' doors. For, long ere we were wedded, all the place Knew Teddy's ways: how mad he was for flowers And singing birds; how often at the plough He used to idle, holding up his head And looking at the clouds; what curious stuff He used to say about the ways of things; How week-days he was never company, Nor tidy on a Sunday. Even then Folk call'd him stupid: so did I myself, At first, before his sheepishness wore off; And then, why I was frighten'd for a time To find how wondrous brightly he could look And talk, when with a girl, and no one by. Right soon he stole this heart of mine away, So cunningly I scarcely guess'd 'twas gone, But found my tongue at work before I knew, Sounding his praises. Mother shook her head; But soon it was the common country talk That he and I were courting. After that Some of his sayings and his doings still Seem'd foolish, but I used to laugh and say, ‘Wait till we marry! I shall make him change!’ And it was pleasant walking after dark, In summer, wandering up and down the lanes, And heark'ning to his talk; and pleasant, too, In winter, to sit cuddling by the fire, And whispering to the quiet firelight sound And the slow ticking of the clock. Ere long, I grew to care for many things he loved. He knew the names of trees, and birds, and flowers, Their races and their seasons; named the stars, Their comings and their goings; and could tell Strange truths about the manners of the clouds. Set him before a hedgerow in a lane, And he was happy all alone for hours. The woods and fields were full of joy to him, And wonders, and fine meanings ever new. How, at the bottom of the wayside well, The foul toad lies and purifies the drink; How twice a year red robin sings a song, Once when the orchis blows its bells in spring, Once when the gold is on the slanted sheaves; How late at night the common nightingale Comes in the season of the barley-sowing, Silently builds her nest among the boughs, And then sings out just as the roses blow, And it is sweet and pleasant in the moon. Why, half his courtship lay in talk like that, And, oh! the way he talk'd fill'd high my heart With pleasure. Then, o' quiet winter nights, With wild bright eyes and voice that broke for joy, He often read aloud from books of songs; One I remember, that I liked the best, A book of pictures and of love-tales, call'd ‘The Seasons.’ I was young, and did not think I only felt 'twas fine. Yet now and then I noticed more, and took a sober fit, And tried to make him tidy in his clothes, And could not, though I tried; and used to sigh When mother mutter'd hints, as mothers will, That he should work more hard and look ahead, And save to furnish out a house for me. . . . For Teddy smiled, poor lad, and work'd more hard, But save . . . not he! Instead of laying by, Making a nest to rear the young ones in, He spent his hard-won cash in buying books,— Much dusty lumber, torn and black and old, Long sheets of ballads, bundles of old rhyme,— And read them, one by one, at home o' nights, Or out aloud to me, or at the plough. I chid at first, but quickly held my tongue, Because he look'd so grieved; and once he said With broken voice and dew-light in his eyes, ‘Lass, I'm a puzzle to myself and you, But take away the books, and I should die!’ His back went bare for books, his stomach starved To buy them,—nay, he pawn'd his jacket once, To get a dreary string of solemn stuff All about Eve and Adam. More and more He slacken'd at his toil; and soon the lad, Who turn'd the cleanest furrow, when he pleased, Of all the ploughmen, let his work go spoil, And fairly led an idle thriftless life In the green woods and on the river side. And then I found that he himself made verse In secret,—verse about the birds and flowers, Songs about lovers, rhymes about the stars, Tales of queer doings in the village here,— All writ on scraps of paper out-o'-doors, And hidden in an old tin coffee-pot Where he had kept his cash. The first I heard Was just a song all about him and me, And cuddling in the kitchen while 'twas snowing; He read it to me, blushing like a girl, And I was pleased, and laugh'd, and thought it fine, And wonder'd where he learn'd to make the words Jingle so sweetly. Then he read me more, Some that I liked, some that I fancied poor; And, last of all, one morn in harvest-time, When all the men were working in the fields, And he was nearly ragged, out it came— ‘They're reaping corn, and corn brings gold, my lass; But I will reap gold, too, and fame beside,— I'm going to print a Book!’ I thought him mad! The words seem'd dreadful—such a fool was I; And I was puzzled more when he explain'd: That he had sent some verses by the post To a rich man who lived by selling songs Yonder in London city; that for months No answer came, and Teddy strain'd his eyes Into the clouds for comfort; that at last There came a letter full of wondrous praise From the great man in London, offering Poor Teddy, if he sent him verse enough To make a pretty little printed book, To value it in money. Till I die, I'll ne'er forget the light on Teddy's face— The light, the glory, and the wonder there: He laugh'd, and read the letter out aloud, He leapt and laugh'd and kiss'd me o'er and o'er, And then he read the letter o'er again, And then turn'd pale, and sank into a chair, And hid his bright face in his hands, and cried. Bewilder'd though I was, my heart was glad To see his happy looks, and pleased beside That fine folk call'd him clever. I said nought To mother—for I knew her ways too well— But waited. Soon came other wondrous news: The scraps of verse had all been copied out On fine white sheets, written in Teddy's hand, Big, round, and clear, like print; and word had come That they were read and praised by other folk, Friends of the man in London. Last of all, One night, when I was ironing the clothes, And mother knitting sat beside the fire, In Teddy came—as bright and fresh and gay As a cock starling hopping from the nest On May-day; and with laughing eyes he cried, ‘Well, mother, when are Bess and I to wed?’ ‘Wed?’ mother snapt, as sour as buttermilk, ‘Wed? when the birds swim, and the fishes fly, And the green trees grow bread and cheese and butter For lazy loons that lie beneath and yawn!’ Then Teddy laugh'd aloud, and when I frown'd And shook my head to warn him, laugh'd the more; And, drawing out his leathern ploughman's pouch, ‘See, mother, see!’ he cried,—and in her lap Pour'd thirty golden guineas! At the first, I scream'd, and mother look'd afraid to touch The glittering gold,—and plain enough she said The gold, she guess'd, was scarcely honest gain; Then Teddy told her all about his book, And how those golden guineas were the price The great rich man in London put upon't. She shook her head the more; and when he read The great man's letter, with its words of praise, Look'd puzzled most of all; and in a dream, Feeling the gold with her thin hand, she sat, While Teddy, proud dew sparkling in his eyes, Show'd me in print the little song he made Of cuddling in the kitchen while 'twas snowing,— ‘And, Bess,’ he cried, ‘the gold will stock a house, But little 'tis I care about the gold: This bit of printed verse is sweeter far Than all the shining wealth of all the world!’ And lifted up the paper to his mouth And kiss'd the print, then held it out at length To look upon't with sparkling, happy eyes, And folded it and put it in his pouch, As tenderly and carefully, I swear, As if it were a note upon a bank For wealth untold. Why linger o'er the tale?— Though now my poor old man is weak and ill, Sweet is the telling of his happy time. The money stock'd a house, and in a month We two were man and wife. Teddy was proud And happy,—busy finishing the book That was his heart's delight; and as for me, My thoughts were merry as a running brook, For Teddy seem'd a wise man after all; And it was spring-time, and our little home Was hung with white clematis, porch and wall, And wall-flower, candituft, and London pride, All shining round a lilac bush in bloom, Sweeten'd the little square of garden ground; And cozy as a finch's mossy nest Was all within; the little sleeping-room And red-tiled kitchen; and, made snug and fine By chairs and tables cut of bran-new deal, The little parlour,—on the mantel-piece Field-flowers and ferns and bird's-egg necklaces, Two pretty pictures pasted on the walls, (The portraits of one Milton and one Burns,) And, in the corner Teddy loved the best, Three shelves to keep the old, black, thumb-mark'd books. And if my heart had fever, lest the life Begun so well was over-bright to last, Teddy could cheer me; for he placed his arm Around me, looking serious in his joy, When we were wed three days; and ‘Bess,’ he said, ‘The Lord above is very kind to me; For He has given me this sweet place and you, Adding the bliss of seeing soon in print The verse I love so much.’ Then, kissing me, ‘I have been thinking of it all,’ he said, ‘Holpen a bit by lives of other folk, Which I have read. Now, many men like me Grow light o' head and let their labour go; But men can't live by writing verses, Bess.’ ‘Nay, nay,’ cried I, ‘'twere pity if they could, For every man would try the easier task, And who would reap the fields or grind the corn?’ And Teddy smiling, said, ‘'Tis so! 'tis so! Pride shall not puff my wits, but all the day I will toil happily in the fields I love; And in the pleasant evenings 'twill be fine To wander forth and see the world with you, Or read out poems in the parlour here, Or take a pen and write, for ease o' heart, Not praise, not money.’ I was glad tenfold,— Put all my fears aside, and trusted him,— And well he kept his word. Yet ill at ease, Restless and eager, Teddy waited on, Until the night a monster parcel came From London: twelve brown volumes, all the same, Wide-printed, thin, and on the foremost page, ‘Poems by Edward Crowhurst, Labourer.’ The happiest hour my Teddy ever knew! He turn'd the volumes o'er, examined each, Counted the sheets, counted the printed lines, Stared at his name in print, held out the page At arm's length, feasting with his mouth and eyes. I wonder'd at his joy, yet, spite o' me, I shared it. 'Twas so catching. The old tale! A little thing could make my Teddy's heart Gay as a bunch of roses, while a great Went by unheeded like a cannon-ball. The glowworm is a little common grub, Yet what a pretty gleam it often sheds; And that same poor, small, common-looking book, Set on our table, kept around its leaves A light like sunshine. When his joy grew cool, Teddy took up a book to read it through; And first he show'd me, next the foremost page, A bit of writing called the ‘Author's Life,’ Made up of simple things my man had told— How he was but a lowly labourer, And how the green fields work'd upon his heart To write about the pretty things he saw— All put together by a clever man In London. For a time he sat and read In silence, looking happy with his eyes; But suddenly he started up and groan'd, Looking as black as bog-mud, while he flung The book upon the table; and I gript His arm, and ask'd what ail'd him. ‘Bess,’ he said, ‘The joy o' this has all gone sudden sour, All through the cruel meddling of a fool: The story of my life is true enough, Despite the fine-flown things the teller sticks Around it—peacock's feathers stuck around The nest of some plain song-bird; but the end Is like the garlic flower,—looks fine at first, But stinks on peeping nearer. Bess, my lass, I never begg'd a penny in my life, I sought the help of no man, but could work, What then? what then? O Bess, 'tis hard, 'tis hard! They make me go a-begging, book in hand, As if I were a gipsy of the lanes Whistling for coppers at an alehouse door!’ I, too, was hurt, but tried to comfort him; 'Twas kindly meant, at least, I thought and said; But Teddy clench'd his teeth, and sat him down, And wrote, not rudely, but as if in grief, To him in London. Till the answer came, The printed poems cheer'd him, though the book Had lost a scent that ne'er would come again; And when the answer came, 'twas like the words A mother murmurs to a silly child— A smiling, pitying, quiet kind of tone, That made him angrier than violent speech; And at the end a melancholy hint About ingratitude. Teddy must trust In those who had his fortune most at heart, Nor rashly turn his friends to enemies, Nor meddle with the kindly schemes of those Who knew the great world better far than he. Oh, Teddy's eyes were dim with bitter dew! ‘Begging is begging, and I never begg'd! Shame on me if I ever take their gold!’ I coax'd him to be silent; and though soon The bitter mood wore off, his gladness lost The look of happy pride it wore of old. 'Twas happy, happy, in the little home, And summer round about on wood and field, And summer on the bit of garden ground. But soon came news, like whiffs of colour'd smoke, Blown to us thickly on the idle wind, And smelling of the city. For the land Was crying Teddy's praises! Every morn Came papers full of things about the Book, And letters full of cheer from distant folk; And Teddy toil'd away, and tried his best To keep his glad heart humble. Then, one day, A smirking gentleman, with inky thumbs, Call'd, chatted, pried with little fox's eyes This way and that, and when he went away He wrote a heap of lying scribble, styled ‘A Summer Morning with the Labourer Bard!’ Then others came: some, mild young gentlemen, Who chirp'd, and blush'd, and simper'd, and were gone; Some, sallow ladies wearing spectacles, And pale young misses, rolling languid eyes, And pecking at the words my Teddy spake Like sparrows picking seed; and, once or twice, Plump merry gentlemen who talk'd no stuff, But chatted sensibly of common things, And made us feel at home. Ay, not a day But Teddy must be sent for, from the fields, To meet with fine-clad strangers from afar. The village folk began to open eyes And wonder, but were only more afraid Of Teddy, gave him hard suspicious looks, And shunn'd him out-o'-doors. Yet how they throng'd, Buzzing like humble bees at swarming time, That morn the oil'd and scented gentleman (For such we thought him) brought a little note From Lord Fitztalbot of Fitztalbot Tower, Yonder across the moorland. 'Twas a line Bidding my Teddy to the Tower, and he Who brought it was the footman of my lord. Well, Teddy went, was many hours away, And then return'd with cat's-claws round his lips. ‘See!’ Teddy cried, and flung a little purse Of money in my lap; and I, amazed, Counted ten golden guineas in my palm, Then gazed at Teddy, saw how pale he was, And ask'd what ail'd him. ‘'Tis the money, lass,’ He answer'd, groaning deep. ‘He talk'd, and seem'd Right kindly; ask'd about my home, and you; Spoke of the poems, smiled, and bow'd farewell; And, dropping that same money in my hat, Bade me go dine below. I burn'd like fire, Felt choking, yet was fearful to offend, And took the money, as I might have took A blazing cinder, bow'd, and came away. O Lord! O Lord! this comes of yonder loon, Who sent the book a-begging!’ Then he talk'd— How fiercely and how wildly, clenching hands: ‘Was not a poet better than a lord? Why should the cruel people use him so? Why would the world not leave his home in peace?’ And last, he vow'd to send the money back But I, though shamed and troubled, thought him wrong, And vow'd my lord was kind, and meant us well, And won him o'er at last to keep the purse. And ah! we found it useful very soon, When I lay in, and had a dreadful time, And brought our girl. Then Teddy put aside All grief and anger; thought of us alone; Forgot, or nearly, all the praise and blame Of loveless strangers; and was proud and glad, Making fond rhymes about the babe and me. Ah! had the folk but let my man alone, All would be happy now. He loved his work, Because it kept him in the fields; he loved The babe and me; and all he needed more, To keep his heart content, was pen and ink, And now and then a book. And as for praise, He needed it no more than singing birds; And as for money, why, he wanted none; And as for prying strangers in the house, They brought a clumsy painful sense of pride That made him restless. He was ever shy Of company—he loved to dream alone— And the poor life that he had known so long Was just the kind of life he suited best. He look'd a fine straight man in homespun gear, But ne'er seem'd easy in his Sunday coat. What should his fine friends do at last, but write, Bidding my man to London,—there to meet A flock o' gentlefolk, who spent their days In making books!-Though here we dwell so near, That northward, far away, you see the sky Black with the smoky breathing of the city, We ne'er had wander'd far away from home, Save once or twice, five miles to westward yonder, To Kersey Fair. Well, Teddy fix'd to go; And seeing him full bent, I held my tongue. And off he set, one day, in Sunday black, A hazel staff over his shoulder flung, His bundle swinging,—and was sped by train To London town. Two weeks he stay'd away; And, when he came from London, he was changed. His eyes look'd wild, his cheek was pale, his step Unsteady; when he enter'd, I could smell Drink in his breath. Full pain'd, and sick at heart, I question'd him; but he was petulant, And snapt me short; and when I brought the child, He push'd her from him. Next day, when he rose, His face was pallid; but his kindly smile Came back upon it. Ere the day was out, He told me of his doings, of the men And places he had seen, and when, and how. He had been dull in dwellings of the rich, Had felt ashamed in great grand drawing-rooms, And angry that the kindly people smiled As if in pity; and the time, he said, Would have gone drearily, had he lack'd the cheer He chanced to find among some jovial folk Who lived by making books. Full plain I saw That something had gone wrong. His ways were strange, He did not seem contented in his home, He scarcely glinted at the poor old books He loved so dearly. In a little time, Teddy grew more himself, at home, a-field, And though, from that day forward, he began To take a glass and smoke a pipe at night, I scarcely noticed. Thus the year wore on; And still the papers praised him far away, And still the letters came from distant folk. And Teddy had made friends: folk who could talk About the things he loved, and flatter him, Ay, laugh aloud to see him drink his glass, And clap his back, and shake him by the hand, How wild soe'er he talk'd. For by degrees His tongue grew freër, he was more at ease With strangers. Oft he spent the evening hours With merry-makers in the public-house, And totter'd home with staring, dazzled eyes. The country people liked him better now, And loved to coax him out to drink at night, And, gaping, heark'd to the strange things he said. Ah, then my fear grew heavy, though his heart Was kindly still, his head still clear and wise, And he went wastering only now and then. But soon his ways grew better, for his time Was spent in finishing another book. Yet then I found him changed in other things; For once or twice when money as before Was sent or given him, he only laugh'd, And took it, not in anger. And, be sure, Money grew needful in the little home— Another babe was coming. Babe and book Were born together, but the first was born Quiet and breathless. 'Twould be idle talk To speak about the book. What came of that, Was much the same as what had come before: The papers praised it over all the land, But just a shade more coolly; strange folk wrote, But not so oft. Yet Teddy was in glee, For this time fifty golden guineas came From the rich man in London. Once again, They coax'd him up to London; once again, Home came he changed,—with wilder words of wit, And sharper sayings, on his tongue. He toil'd Even less than ever: nay, his idle friends, Who loved to drain the bottle at his side, Took up his time full sorely. We began To want and pinch: more money was subscribed, And taken:—till at last my man grew sick Of working in the open fields at all And just as work grew hardest to his mind, The Lord Fitztalbot pass'd him on the road, And turn'd his head away. A change had come, As dreadful as the change within himself. The papers wrote the praise of newer men, The strange folk sent him letters scarce at all; And when he spake about another book, The man in London wrote a hasty ‘No!’ And said the work had little chance to sell. Those words were like a sunstroke. Wild and scared, My Teddy stared at London—all his dreams Came back upon him—and with bitter tongue He mock'd and threaten'd. 'Twas of no avail! His fine-day friends like swallows wing'd away, The summer being o'er; the country folk Began to knit their foreheads as of old, Save one or two renown'd as ne'er-do-wells; And, mad with pride, bitten with shame and fear, Teddy drank deeper at the public-house. Teddy to blame? Teddy to blame? Ah, nay! The blame be theirs who broke his simple pride With money, beggar'd him against his will. The blame be theirs who flatter'd him from home, And led him out to make his humble ways An idle show. The blame be theirs who smiled Whene'er he play'd a wrong and foolish part, Because he had skill to write a bit of verse. The blame be theirs who spoil'd him like a child, And, when the newness of his face was gone, Turn'd from him scornfully and smiled elsewhere. Teddy to blame!—a silly, ignorant man, Not learn'd, not wise, not cunning in the world! But hearken how I changed him yet once more, One day when he was sick and ill with pain. I spake of all our early courting days, Full low and tender, of the happy time When I brought forth our girl, and of the words He spake when we were happy; last of all, ‘Teddy,’ I said, ‘let people be unkind, The whole world hard, you cannot heal your pain Wastering, idling; think of merrier days, Of me, and of our girl, and drink no more.’ He gazed at me full long, his bosom rose And flutter'd, and he held my hand in his, And shivering, moaning, sank into a chair; And, looking at the bookshelf at his side, And at the common-looking thumb-mark'd books, He promised, promised, with his poor cheeks wet, And his voice broken, and his lips set firm. True Heart, he kept his word. The public-house Knew him no longer; in the fields he toil'd Lonely once more; and in the evenings Read books and wrote,—and all he wrote, I know, Was sad, sad, sad. Bravely he work'd all day, But not so cheerfully. And no man cared To brighten him with goodly words. His face Was stale with gentlefolk, his heart too proud To mix with coarse, low men. Oft in the fields They saw him turn his poor eyes London-wards, And sigh; but he was silent of the pain That grew upon him. Slowly he became The sadden'd picture of his former self: He stood at ploughtail looking at the clouds, He watch'd the ways of birds and trees and flowers; But all the little things he learn'd and loved Had ta'en a sadder meaning. Oftentimes, In spite of all he did to hide his heart, I saw he would have been a happy man If any one had praised him as of old; But he was never sent for from the fields, No strangers wrote to cheer him, and he seem'd All, all, forgotten. Still, as true as steel, He held his promise to our girl and me, Though oft, I know, the dreadful longing came To fly to drink for comfort. Then, one night, I heard a stirring in the dark: our girl Crept close to me, and whisper'd in mine ear— ‘Hark! father's crying!’ O 'tis terrible To hear a strong man weep! I could not bear To find him grieving so, but crept unto him, And put my arms about him, on his neck Weeping, ‘O Teddy, Teddy, do not so! Cheer up, for you will kill me if you cry. What do you long for? Why are you so sad?’ And I could feel him crush his hot tears down, And shake through every limb. ‘O lass!’ he cried, ‘I cannot give a name to what I want; I cannot tell you why I grow so sad; But I have lost the pleasure and the peace The verses brought me. I am sick and changed,— I think too much of other men,—I seem Despised and useless. If I did not feel You loved me so, and were so kind and true, When all the world is cruel, I should fall And wither. All my strength is gone away, And I am broken!’ 'Twas but little cheer That I could give him: that was grief too deep For foolish me to understand or cure. I made the little parlour bright o' nights, Coax'd him to read aloud the books he loved, And often he was like himself again, Singing for ease o' heart; and now and then, A poem printed in a newspaper, Or something kind from people in the world, Help'd me a little. So the time wore on;— Till suddenly, one night in winter time, I saw him change. Home came he white and pale, Shivering, trembling, looking wild and strange, Yet speaking quietly. ‘My head feels queer— It aches a bit!’ he said; and the next day He could not rise from bed. Quiet he lay, But now and then I saw him raise his hand And hold his forehead. In the afternoon, He fell to troubled sleep, and, when he woke, He did not seem to know me. Full of fear, I sent for Doctor Barth. When Doctor came, He found poor Teddy tossing on his bed, Moaning and muttering and clenching teeth, And Doctor said, ‘The ill is on the brain— Has he been troubled lately?’ and I cried, ‘Ay, much, much troubled! He has fretted sore For many months!’ 'Twas sad, 'twas sad, to see My strong man suffer on his dull sick-bed, Not knowing me, but crying out of things That haunted him. I will not weary you, By telling how the Doctor brought him round, And how at last he rose from bed, the ghost Of his old self, and something gone away That never would return. Then it was plain That he could work no more: the Light had fled, Which keeps a man a man despite the world And all its cruel change. To fright the wolf, I took in washing at the cottage here; And people sent us money now and then, And pitying letters reach'd us from the world, Too late! too late! Thank the good God above, Who made me strong and willing, I could keep The little house above us, though 'twas dear, And ah! I work'd more hard because I knew Poor Teddy's heart would break outright elsewhere. Yet Teddy hardly seem'd to comprehend All that had happen'd. Though he knew me well, And spake full sensibly of many things, He lack'd the power to speak of one thing long. Sometimes he was as merry as a bird, Singing wild songs he learn'd by heart when young; Sometimes he wish'd to wander out afield, But easy 'twas to lead his wits away To other things. And he was changeful ever, Now laughing and now crying; and at times He wrote strange notes to poets that were dead, And named himself by all their names in turn, Still making verse, which I had sense to see Was wild, and strange, and wrong—not like the verse He made of old. One day for hours he sat, Looking upon the bit of garden ground, And smiling. When I spoke, he look'd and laugh'd. ‘Surely you know me, Teddy?’ I exclaim'd; And up he raised his head, with shrill thin voice Saying, ‘Yes, you are Queen Elizabeth, And I am Shakespeare;’ and again he smiled Craftily to himself; but when I hung Around his neck, and wept, and ask'd again, He turn'd upon me with so pale a look, So wan, so sharp, so full of agony, 'Twas clear the cloud was lifted for a moment, 'Twas clear he knew that he was Teddy Crowhurst, And that the light of life had gone away. And oft, in sunny weather, he and I Had walks in quiet places,—in the lanes, And in the woods, and by the river side; And he was happy, prying as of old In little mossy nests, or plucking flowers, Or dropping pebbles at the water-brim, To make the speckled minnows start and fly In little gleams of light. Ne'er had he been More cunning in the ways and looks of things, Though memory fail'd him when he tried for names. The sable streaks upon the arum-flower Were strange to him as ever; a lark singing Made his eyes misty as it used to do; The shining sun, the waving of green boughs, The rippling of the river down the dell, Were still true pleasure. All the seasons brought Something to charm him. Staring on the snow, Or making great snow-houses like a boy, He was as busy when the boughs were bare, As carrying home a bough of scented May Or bunch of yellow lilies from the pond. What had been pleasure in his younger days Came back to keep him quiet in the world. He gave much love to trees and birds and flowers, And, when the mighty world was all unkind, The little, gentle, speechless things were true. True Heart, I never thought that he could bear To last so long; but ten slow years have fled Since the first book that brought the trouble and pain Was printed,—and within the parlour there Teddy is sitting, busy as a bee. Doing? He dreams the world that knows him not Rings with his praises, and for many an hour Sits busy with the verse of later years, Marks, copies, and arranges it with care, To go to some great printer that he thinks Is waiting; and from time to time he eyes The books they printed, numbering the lines, Counting the pages. Sometimes he is Burns, Sometimes John Milton, sometimes other men, And sometimes—always looking saddest then— Knows he is Teddy Crowhurst. Thin he is, And worn, and feeble,—wearing slowly down Like snowdrift; and at times, when Memory Comes for a moment like a mirror flash'd Into his eyes, he does not groan and weep, But droops the more, and seems resign'd and still. True Heart, I fear the end is near at last! He sits and hearkens vacantly and dreams, He thrills at every knocking at the door, Stilly he waits for light that never comes, That never will return until the end. And oft at evening, when my work is done, And the dark gathers, and he holds my hand, The waiting grows intenser, and becomes The sense o' life itself. Take Teddy hence! Show me the man will draw my hand away! I am a quiet comfort to his pain; For though his thoughts be far away from here, I know he feels my hand; and ah! the touch Just keeps his heart from breaking. 'Tis my joy To work where I can watch him through the day, And quiet him, and see he wants for nought. He loves to sit among his books and flowers, And wears away with little pain, and feels The quiet parlour is a pleasant place; And there—God bless him!—in a happy time Teddy will feel the darkness pass away, And smile farewell upon his wife and girl, And Light that he has lost will come again To shine upon him as he goes to sleep. ARTIST AND MODEL: A LOVE POEM. The scorn of the nations is bitter, But the touch of a hand is warm. Is it not pleasant to wander In town on Saturday night, While people go hither and thither, And shops shed cheerful light? And, arm in arm, while our shadows Chase us along the panes, Are we not quite as cozy As down among country lanes? Nobody knows us, heeds us, Nobody hears or sees, And the shop-lights gleam more gladly Than the moon on hedges and trees; And people coming and going, All upon ends of their own, Though they work a spell on the spirit, Make it more finely alone. The sound seems harmless and pleasant As the murmur of brook and wind; The shops with the fruit and the pictures Have sweetness to suit my mind; And nobody knows us, heeds us, And our loving none reproves,— I, the poor figure-painter! You, the lady he loves! And what if the world should scorn you For now and again, as you do, Assuming a country kirtle, And bonnet of straw thereto, Or the robe of a vestal virgin, Or a nun's gray gabardine, And keeping a brother and sister By standing and looking divine? And what if the world, moreover, Should silently pass me by, Because at the dawn of the struggle, I labour some stories high! Why, there's comfort in waiting, working, And feeling one's heart beat right,— And rambling alone, love-making, In London on Saturday night. For when, with a blush Titianic, You peep'd in that lodging of mine, Did I not praise the good angels For sending a model so fine? When I was fill'd with the pureness You brought to the lonely abode, Did I not learn to love you? And—did Love not lighten the load? And haply, indeed, little darling, While I yearn'd and plotted and plann'd, And you watch'd me in love and in yearning Your heart did not quite understand All the wonder and aspiration You meant by your loveliness, All the faith in the frantic endeavour Your beautiful face could express! For your love and your beauty have thriven On things of a low degree, And you do not comprehend clearly The drift of a dreamer like me; And perchance, when you look'd so divinely, You meant, and meant only, to say: ‘How sad that he dwells in a garret! And lives on so little a day!’ What of that? If your sweetness and beauty, And the love that is part of thee, Were mirror'd in wilder visions, And express'd much more to me, Did the beautiful face, my darling, Need subtler, loftier lore?— Nay, beauty is all our wisdom,— We painters demand no more. Indeed, I had been no painter, And never could hope to rise, Had I lack'd the power of creating The meanings for your sweet eyes; And what you were really thinking Scarcely imported, in sooth,— Since the truth we artists fail for, Is the truth that looks the truth. Your beautiful face was before me, Set in its golden hair; And the wonder and love and yearning Were shining sublimely there! And your eyes said—‘Work for glory! Up, up, where the angels call!’ And I understood, and I labour'd, And I love the face for it all! I am talking, you think, so strangely! And you watch with wondering eyes!— Could I utter one half of the yearning Your face, even now, implies! But the yearning will not be utter'd, And never, ah! never can be, Till the work of the world is over, And we see as immortals see. Yet bless thee for ever and ever, For keeping me humble and true, And would that my Art could utter The wisdom I find in you. Enough to labour and labour, And to feel one's heart beat right, And to wander unknown, love-making, In London on Saturday night! You think: ‘How dearly I love him! How dearly he loves me! How sweet to live on, and love him, With children at my knee! With the useless labour over, And comfort and leisure won, And clever people praising The work that he has done!’ I think: ‘How dearly I love her! How dearly she loves me! Yet the beauty the heart would utter Endeth in agony; And life is a climbing, a seeking Of something we never can see! And death is a slumber, a dreaming Of something that may not be!’ And your face is sweetly troubled, Your little hand stirs on mine own, For you guess at a hidden meaning, Since I speak in so tender a tone; And you rain the yearning upon me You brought to my help before, And I ask no mightier wisdom,— We painters demand no more. And we shall live, my darling, Together till we grow old, And people will buy my pictures, And you will gather the gold, And your loveliness will reward me, And sanctify all I do, And toiling for Love's sake, darling, I may toil for Fame's sake, too. Ah, dearest, how much you teach me, How much of hope and of light, Up yonder, planning and painting, And here on Saturday night; And I turn sad eyes no longer From the pageant that passes around, And the vision no more seems weary, And the head may yet be crown'd! And I ask no more from mortals Than your beautiful face implies,— The beauty the artist beholding Interprets and sanctifies. Who says that men have fallen, That life is wretched and rough? I say, the world is lovely, And that loveliness is enough. So my doubting days are ended, And the labour of life seems clear; And life hums deeply around me, Just like the murmur here, And quickens the sense of living, And shapes me for peace and storm,— And dims my eyes with gladness When it glides into colour and form! His form and His colour, darling, Are all we apprehend, Though the meaning that underlies them May be utter'd in the end; And I seek to go no deeper Than the beauty and wonder there, Since the world can look so wondrous, And your face can look so fair. For ah! life's stream is bitter, When too greedily we drink, And I might not be so happy If I knew quite all you think; And when God takes much, my darling, He leaves us the colour and form,— The scorn of the nations is bitter, But the touch of a hand is warm. NELL. She gazes not at her who hears, But, while the gathering darkness cries, Stares at the vacancy through tears, That burn upon her glistening eyes, Yet do not flow. Her hair falls free Around a face grown deathly thin; Her elbow rests upon her knee, And in her palms she props her chin. See, Nan! his little face looks pinch'd with fright, His little hands are clench'd together tight! Born dead, that's comfort! quiet too; when one Thinks of what kill'd him! Kiss him, Nan, for me. Thank God, he never look'd upon the sun That saw his father hang'd on gallowstree. O boy, my boy! you're better dead and sleeping, Kill'd by poor mother's fear, and shame, and weeping: She never loved another living man, But held to father all thro' right and wrong— Ah, yes! I never turn'd against him, Nan, I stuck by him that stuck by me so long! You're a kind woman, Nan! ay, kind and true! God will be good to faithful folk like you! You knew my Ned? A better, kinder lad never drew breath— We loved each other true, though never wed In church, like some who took him to his death: A lad as gentle as a lamb, but lost His senses when he took a drop too much— Drink did it all—drink made him mad when cross'd— He was a poor man, and they're hard on such. O Nan! that night! that night! When I was sitting in this very chair, Watching and waiting in the candle-light, And heard his foot come creaking up the stair, And turn'd, and saw him standing yonder, white And wild, with staring eyes and rumpled hair! And when I caught his arm and call'd, in fright, He push'd me, swore, and to the door he pass'd To lock and bar it fast! Then down he drops just like a lump of lead, Holding his brow, shaking, and growing whiter, And—Nan!—just then the light seem'd growing brighter, And I could see the hands that held his head, All red! all bloody red! What could I do but scream? He groan'd to hear, Jump'd to his feet, and gripp'd me by the wrist; ‘Be still, or I shall kill thee, Nell!’ he hiss'd. And I was still, for fear. ‘They're after me—I've knifed a man!’ he said. ‘Be still!—the drink—drink did it—he is dead!’ And as he said the word, the wind went by With a whistle and cry— The room swam round—the babe unborn seem'd to scream out, and die! Then we grew still, dead still. I couldn't weep— All I could do was cling to Ned and heark— And Ned was cold, cold, cold, as if asleep, But breathing hard and deep. The candle flicker'd out—the room grew dark— And—Nan!—although my heart was true and tried,— When all grew cold and dim, I shudder'd—not for fear of them outside, But just afraid to be alone with him. For winds were wailing—the wild rain cried,— Folk's footsteps sounded down the court and died— What could I do but clasp his knees and cling? And call his name beneath my breath in pain? Until he threw his head up, listening, And gave a groan, and hid his face again; ‘Ned! Ned!’ I whisper'd—and he moan'd and shook— But did not heed or look! ‘Ned! Ned! speak, lad! tell me it is not true!’ At that he raised his head and look'd so wild; Then, with a stare that froze my blood, he threw His arms around me, crying like a child, And held me close—and not a word was spoken— While I clung tighter to his heart and press'd him— And did not fear him, though my heart was broken— But kiss'd his poor stain'd hands, and cried, and bless'd him! Then, Nan, the dreadful daylight, coming cold With sound o' falling rain,— When I could see his face, and it look'd old, Like the pinch'd face of one that dies in pain; Well, though we heard folk stirring in the sun, We never thought to hide away or run, Until we heard those voices in the street, That hurrying of feet. And Ned leap'd up, and knew that they had come. ‘Run, Ned!’ I cried, but he was deaf and dumb! ‘Hide, Ned!’ I scream'd, and held him— ‘hide thee, man!’ He stared with bloodshot eyes, and hearken'd, Nan! And all the rest is like a dream—the sound Of knocking at the door— A rush of men—a struggle on the ground— A mist—a tramp—a roar; For when I got my senses back again, The room was empty—and my head went round! The neighbours talk'd and stirr'd about the lane, And Seven Dials made a moaning sound; And as I listen'd, lass, it seem'd to me Just like the murmur of the great dark Sea, And Ned a-lying somewhere, stiff and drown'd! God help him? God will help him! Ay, no fear! It was the drink, not Ned—he meant no wrong; So kind! so good!—and I am useless here, Now he is lost that loved me true and long. Why, just before the last of it, we parted, And Ned was calm, though I was broken-hearted; And ah, my heart was broke! and ah, I cried And kiss'd him,—till they took me from his side; And though he died that way, (God bless him!) Ned Went through it bravely, calm as any there: They've wrought their fill of spite upon his head, And—there's the hat and clothes he used to wear! . . . That night before he died, I didn't cry—my heart was hard and dried; But when the clocks went ‘one,’ I took my shawl To cover up my face, and stole away, And walk'd along the silent streets, where all Look'd cold and still and gray,— Only the lamps o' London here and there Scatter'd a dismal gleaming; And on I went, and stood in Leicester Square, Ay, like a woman dreaming: But just as ‘three’ was sounded close at hand, I started and turn'd east, before I knew,— Then down Saint Martin's Lane, along the Strand, And through the toll-gate, on to Waterloo. How I remember all I saw, although 'Twas only like a dream!— The long still lines o' lights, the chilly gleam Of moonshine on the deep black stream below; While far, far, far away, along the sky Streaks soft as silver ran, And the pale Moon look'd paler up on high, And little sounds in far-off streets began! Well, while I stood, and waited, and look'd down, And thought how sweet 'twould be to drop and drown, Some men and lads went by, And turning round, I gazed, and watch'd 'em go, Then felt that they were going to see him die, And drew my shawl more tight, and follow'd slow. How clear I feel it still! The streets grew light, but rain began to fall; I stopp'd and had some coffee at a stall, Because I felt so chill; A cock crew somewhere, and it seem'd a call To wake the folk who kill! The man who sold the coffee stared at me! I must have been a sorry sight to see! More people pass'd—a country cart with hay Stopp'd close beside the stall,—and two or three Talk'd about it! I moan'd, and crept away! Ay, nearer, nearer to the dreadful place, All in the falling rain, I went, and kept my shawl upon my face, And felt no grief or pain— Only the wet that soak'd me through and through Seem'd cold and sweet and pleasant to the touch— It made the streets more drear and silent, too, And kept away the light I fear'd so much. Slow, slow the wet streets fill'd, and all seem'd going, Laughing and chatting, the same way, And grayer, sadder, lighter, it was growing, Though still the rain fell fast and darken'd day! Nan!—every pulse was burning—I could feel My heart was made o' steel— As crossing Ludgate Hill, I saw, all blurr'd, Saint Paul's great clock and heard it slowly chime, And hadn't power to count the strokes I heard, But strain'd my eyes and saw it wasn't time. Ah! then I felt I dared not creep more near, But went into a lane off Ludgate Hill, And sitting on a doorstep, I could hear The people gathering still! And still the rain was falling, falling, And deadening the hum I heard from there; And wet and stiff, I heard the people calling, And watch'd the rain-drops glistening down my hair, My elbows on my knees, my fingers dead,— My shawl thrown off, now none could see,—my head Dripping and wild and bare. I heard the crying of a crowd of men, And next, a hollow sound I knew full well, For something gripp'd me round the heart!—and then There came the solemn tolling of a bell! O God! O God! how could I sit close by, And neither scream nor cry? As if I had been stone, all hard and cold, I listen'd, listen'd, listen'd, still and dumb, While the folk murmur'd, and the death-bell toll'd, And the day brighten'd, and his time had come. . . . . . . Till—Nan!—all else was silent, but the knell Of the slow bell! And I could only wait, and wait, and wait, And what I waited for I couldn't tell,— At last there came a groaning deep and great— Saint Paul's struck ‘eight’— I scream'd, and seem'd to turn to fire, and fell! God bless him, live or dead! Oh, he was kind and true— They've wrought their fill of spite upon his head— Why didn't they be kind, and take me too? And there's the dear old things he used to wear, And here's a lock o' hair! And Ned! my Ned! Is fast asleep, and cannot hear me call;— God bless you, Nan, for all you've done and said, But don't mind me! My heart is broke, that's all! ATTORNEY SNEAK. Sharp like a tyrant, timid like a slave, A little man, with yellow, bloodless cheek; A snappish mingling of the fool and knave, Resulting in the hybrid compound—Sneak. Put execution in on Mrs. Hart— If people will be careless, let them smart: Oh, hang her children! just the common cry! Am I to feed her family? Not I. I'm tender-hearted, but I dare be just,— I never go beyond the law, I trust; I've work'd my way, plotted and starved and plann'd, Commenced without a penny in my hand, And never howl'd for help, or dealt in sham— No! I'm a man of principle, I am. What's that you say? Oh, father has been here? Of course, you sent him packing? Dear, oh, dear! When one has work'd his weary way, like me, To comfort and respectability, Can pay his bills, and save a pound or two, And say his prayers on Sunday in a pew, Can look the laws of England in the face, 'Tis hard, 'tis hard, 'tis shame, and 'tis disgrace, That one's own father—old and worn and gray— Should be the only hindrance in his way. Swore, did he? Very pretty! Threaten'd? Oh! Demanded money? You, of course, said ‘No’? 'Tis hard—my life will never be secure— He'll be my ruin some day, I am sure. I don't deny my origin was low— All the more credit to myself, you know: Mother (I never saw her) was a tramp, Father half tramp, half pedlar, and whole scamp, Who travell'd over England with a pack, And carried me about upon his back, Trudging from door to door, to feasts and fairs, Cheating the silly women with his wares, Stealing the farmers' ducks and hens for food, Pilfering odds and ends where'er he could, And resting in a city now and then, Till it became too hot,—and off again. Beat me? No, he knew better. I confess He used me with a sort of tenderness; But would have warp'd my nature into sin, Had I been weak, for lack of discipline, Why, even now, I shudder to the soul, To think how oft I ate the food he stole, And how I wore upon my back the things He won by cheats and lawless bargainings. Oh, he had feelings, that I freely say; But, without principle, what good are they? He swindled and he stole on every hand, And I was far too young to reprimand; And, for the rest, why, he was circumspect, And might have been committed for neglect. Ah! how I managed, under stars so ill, To thrive at all, to me is mystery still. In spite of father, though, I got along, And early learn'd to judge the right from wrong; At roadsides, when we stopp'd to rest and feed, He gave me lessons how to write and read, I got a snack of schooling here and there, And learn'd to sum by instinct, as it were. Then, latterly, when I was seventeen, All sorts of evil I had heard and seen; Knew father's evil ways, bemoan'd my fate, Long'd to be wealthy, virtuous, and great; Swore, with the fond ambition of a lad, To make good use of what poor gifts I had. At last, tired, sick, of wandering up and down, Hither I turn'd my thoughts,—to London town; And finally, with little doubt or fear, Made up my mind to try my fortune here. Well, father stared at first, and shook his head; But when he found I held to what I said, He clasp'd me tight, and hugg'd me to his heart, And begg'd and pray'd tha I would not depart; Said I was all for whom he had to care, His only joy in trudging here and there; Vow'd, if I ever left him, he would die,— Then, last of all, of course, began to cry. You know how men of his position feel? Selfish, at best, even when it is real! I tried to smooth him over, and, next day, I pack'd what things I had, and ran away. I need not tell you all my weary fight, To get along in life, and do aright— How often people, when I sought a place, Still push'd my blessed father in my face; Until, at last, when I was almost stark, Old Lawyer Hawk made me his under-clerk; How from that moment, by avoiding wrong, Possessing principle, I got along; Read for the law, plotted, and dream'd, and plann'd, Until—I reach'd the height on which I stand. 'Twas hard, 'twas hard! Just as my business grows, In father pops his miserable nose, Steps in, not sober, in a ragged dress, And worn tenfold with want and wickedness; Calls me hard names because I wish'd to rise; Here, in the office, like a baby cries; Smothers my pride with shame and with disgrace, Till, red as fire, I coax'd him from the place. What could I do under so great a blow? I gave him money, tried to make him go; But ah! he meant to rest, I plain could see, His ragged legs 'neath my mahogany! No principle! When I began complaining, How he would be my ruin by remaining, He turn'd upon me, white and wild, and swore, And would have hit me, had I utter'd more ‘Tommy,’ he dared to say, ‘you've done amiss; I never thought to see you come to this. I would have stopp'd you early on the journey, If I had ever thought you'd grow attorney, Sucking the blood of people here in London; But you have done it, and it can't be undone. And, Tommy, I will do my best to see You don't at all disgrace yourself and me.’ I rack'd my brains, I moan'd and tore my hair, Saw nothing left but ruin and despair; Father at hand, why, all would deem me low: ‘Sneak's father? humph!’—the business would go. The labour of long years would come to nought! At last I hit upon a happy thought: Why should not father, if he pleased to be, Be decent and respectable like me; He would be glad and grateful, if a grain Of principle were settled in his brain. I made the offer,—proud he seem'd and glad.— There rose a hope he'd change to good from bad, Though, ‘Tommy, 'tis a way of getting bread I never thought to come upon,’ he said; And so I placed him in the office here, A clerk at five and thirty pounds a year. I put it to you, could a man do more? I felt no malice, did not close my door, Gave him the chance to show if he was wise: He had the world before him, and could rise. Well, for a month or more, he play'd no tricks, Writ-drawing, copying, from nine to six, Not smart, of course, or clever, like the rest, But trying, it appear'd, to do his best; But by and by he changed—old fire broke out— He snapp'd when seniors order'd him about— Came late to office, tried to loaf and shirk— Would sit for precious hours before his work, And scarcely lift a pen, but sleepily stare Out through the window at the empty air, And watch the sunshine lying in the lane, Or the bluebottles buzzing on the pane, And look as sad and worn and grieved and strange As if he ne'er had had a chance to change; Came one day staggering in a drunken fit; Flatly refused one day to serve a writ. I talk'd, appeal'd, talk'd of my honest name, He stared, turn'd pale, swore loud, and out it came: He hated living with that monkey crew, Had tried his best and found it would not do; He could not bear, forsooth, to watch the tears Of people with the Law about their ears, Would rather steal his meals from place to place, Than bring the sorrow to a poor man's face— In fact, you see, he hated all who pay, Or seek their moneys in the honest way; Moreover, he preferr'd a roadside crust, To cleanly living with the good and just: Old, wild, and used to roaming up and down, He could not bear to stagnate in a town; To stick in a dark office in a street, Was downright misery to a man with feet; Serving the law was more than he could bear, Give him his pack, his freedom, and fresh air. Mark that! how base, ungrateful, gross, and bad! His want of principle had made him mad. I gave him money, sent him off by train, And trusted ne'er to see his face again. But he came back. Of course. Look'd wan and ill, More ragged and disreputable still. Despairing, groaning, wretchedest of men, I granted him another trial then. Still the old story—the same vacant stare Out through the window at the empty air, More watching of the sunshine in the lane, And the bluebottles buzzing on the pane, Then more of tipsiness and drunken dizziness, And rage at things done in the way of business. I saw the very office servants sneer, And I determined to be more severe. At last, one winter morn, I went to him, And found him sitting, melancholy, grim, Sprawling like any schoolboy on his seat, And scratching drawings on a foolscap sheet: Here, an old hag, with half-a-dozen chits, Lash'd with a cat-o'-nine-tails, labell'd ‘Writs;’ There, a young rascal, ragged as a daw, Drinking a cup of poison, labell'd ‘Law;’ Elsewhere, the Devil, looking o'er a pile Of old indictments with a crafty smile, And sticking Lawyers on an office file! And in a corner, wretchedly devised, A shape in black, that kick'd and agonised, Strung by a pauper to a gallows great, And underneath it written, ‘Tommie's fate!’ I touch'd his arm, conducted him aside, Produced a bunch of documents, and cried: ‘Now, father, no more nonsense! You must be No more a plague and a disgrace to me— If you won't work like others, you must quit; See, here are two subpœnas, there a writ, Serve these on Such-a-one and So-and-so. Be sharp,—and mind your conduct, or you go.’ He never said a word, but with a glare All round him, drew his thin hand through his hair, Turn'd white, and took the paper silently, Put on his hat, and peep'd again at me. Then quietly, not like a man in ire, Threw all the precious papers on the fire! And turning quickly, crying with a shout, ‘You, and your documents, be damn'd!’ went out. He came again! Ay, after wandering o'er The country as of old, he came once more. I gave him money, off he went; and then, After a little year, he came again; Ay, came, and came, still ragged, bad, and poor, And he will be my ruin, I am sure. He tells the same old tale from year to year, How to his heart I ever will be dear; Or oft into a fit of passion flies, Calls me ungrateful and unkind,—then cries, Raves of his tenderness and suffering, And mother's too—and all that sort of thing! He haunts me ever like a goblin grim, And—to be candid—I'm afraid of him; For, ah! all now is hopeless, to my cost,— Through want of principle the man is lost. —That's Badger, is it? He must go to Vere, The Bank of England clerk. The writ is here. Say, for his children's sake, we may relent, If he'll renew at thirty-five per cent. BARBARA GRAY. A mourning woman, robed in black, Stands in the twilight, looking back; Her hand is on her heart, her head Bends musingly above the Dead, Her face is plain, and pinch'd, and thin, But splendour strikes it from within. I. ‘Barbara Gray! Pause, and remember what the world will say,’ I cried, and turning on the threshold fled, When he was breathing on his dying bed; But when, with heart grown bold, I cross'd the threshold cold, Here lay John Hamerton, and he was dead. II. And all the house of death was chill and dim, The dull old housekeeper was looking grim, The hall-clock ticking slow, the dismal rain Splashing by fits against the window-pane, The garden shivering in the twilight dark, Beyond, the bare trees of the empty park, And faint gray light upon the great cold bed, And I alone; and he I turn'd from,—dead III. Ay, ‘dwarf’ they called this man who sleeping lies; No lady shone upon him with her eyes, No tender maiden heard his true-love vow, And pressed her kisses on the great bold brow. What cared John Hamerton? With light, light laugh, He halted through the streets upon his staff; Halt, lame, not beauteous, yet with winning grace And sweetness in his pale and quiet face; Fire, hell's or heaven's, in his eyes of blue; Warm words of love upon his tongue thereto; Could win a woman's Soul with what he said, And I am here; and here he lieth dead. IV. I would not blush if the bad world saw now How by his bed I stoop and kiss his brow! Ay, kiss it, kiss it, o'er and o'er again, With all the love that fills my heart and brain. V. For where was man had stoop'd to me before, Though I was maiden still, and girl no more? Where was the spirit that had deign'd to prize The poor plain features and the envious eyes? What lips had whisper'd warmly in mine ears? When had I known the passion and the tears? Till he I look on sleeping came unto me, Found me among the shadows, stoop'd to woo me, Seized on the heart that flutter'd withering here, Stung it and wrung it with new joy and fear, Yea, brought the rapturous light, and brought the day, Waken'd the dead heart, withering away, Put thorns and roses on the unhonour'd head, That felt but roses till the roses fled! Who, who, but he crept unto sunless ground, Content to prize the faded face he found? John Hamerton, I pardon all—sleep sound, my love, sleep sound! VI. What fool that crawls shall prate of shame and sin? Did he not think me fair enough to win? Yea, stoop and smile upon my face as none, Living or dead, save he alone, had done? Bring the bright blush unto my cheek, when ne'er The full of life and love had mantled there? And I am all alone; and here lies he,— The only man that ever smiled on me. VII. Here, in his lonely dwelling-house he lies, The light all faded from his winsome eyes: Alone, alone, alone, he slumbers here, With wife nor little child to shed a tear! Little, indeed, to him did nature give; Nor was he good and pure as some that live, But pinch'd in body, warp'd in limb, He hated the bad world that loved not him! VIII. Barbara Gray! Pause, and remember how he turn'd away; Think of your wrongs, and of your sorrows. Nay! Woman, think rather of the shame and wrong Of pining lonely in the dark so long; Think of the comfort in the grief he brought. The revelation in the love he taught. Then, Barbara Gray! Blush not, nor heed what the cold world will say; But kiss him, kiss him, o'er and o'er again, In passion and in pain, With all the love that fills your heart and brain! Yea, kiss him, bless him, pray beside his bed, For you have lived, and here your love lies dead. THE BLIND LINNET. ?? ??? ???? ?? ????, ??? ?? ?????? ????? ?? ????? ?????? Soph. Œd. Tyr. I. The sempstress's linnet sings At the window opposite me;— It feels the sun on its wings, Though it cannot see. Can a bird have thoughts? May be. II. The sempstress is sitting, High o'er the humming street, The little blind linnet is flitting Between the sun and her seat. All day long She stitches wearily there, And I know she is not young, And I know she is not fair; For I watch her head bent down Throughout the dreary day, And the thin meek hair o' brown Is threaded with silver gray; And now and then, with a start At the fluttering of her heart, She lifts her eyes to the bird, And I see in the dreary place The gleam of a thin white face. And my heart is stirr'd. III. Loud and long The linnet pipes his song! For he cannot see The smoky street all round, But loud in the sun sings he, Though he hears the murmurous sound; For his poor, blind eyeballs blink, While the yellow sunlights fall, And he thinks (if a bird can think) He hears a waterfall, Or the broad and beautiful river Washing fields of corn, Flowing for ever Through the woods where he was born; And his voice grows stronger, While he thinks that he is there, And louder and longer Falls his song on the dusky air, And oft, in the gloaming still, Perhaps (for who can tell?) The musk and the muskatel, That grow on the window sill, Cheat him with their smell. IV. But the sempstress can see How dark things be; How black through the town The stream is flowing; And tears fall down Upon her sewing. So at times she tries, When her trouble is stirr'd To close her eyes, And be blind like the bird. And then, for a minute, As sweet things seem, As to the linnet Piping in his dream! For she feels on her brow The sunlight glowing, And hears nought now But a river flowing— A broad and beautiful river, Washing fields of corn, Flowing for ever Through the woods where she was born— And a wild bird winging Over her head, and singing! And she can smell The musk and the muskatel That beside her grow, And, unaware, She murmurs an old air That she used to know! `TIGER BAY: A STORMY NIGHT'S DREAM. I. The Tigress. A Dream I had in the dead of night: Darkness—the Jungle—a black Man sleeping— Head on his arm, with the moon-dew creeping Over his face in a silvern light: The Moon was driving, the Wind was crying; Two great lights gleam'd, round, horrid, and red, Two great eyes, steadfast beside the bed Where the man was lying. Hark! hark! What wild things cry in the dark? Only the Wind as it raves, Only the Beasts in their caves, Where the Jungle waves. The man slept on, and his face was bright, Tender and strange, for the man was dreaming— Coldly the light on his limbs was gleaming, On his jet-black limbs and their folds of white;— Leprous-spotted, and gaunt, and hated, With teeth protruding and hideous head, Her two eyes burning so still, so red, The Tigress waited. Hark! hark! The wild things cry in the dark; The Wind whistles and raves, The Beasts groan in their caves, And the Jungle waves. From cloud to cloud the cold Moon crept, The silver light kept coming and going— The Jungle under was bleakly blowing, The Tigress watch'd, and the black Man slept. The Wind was wailing, the Moon was gleaming: He stirr'd and shiver'd, then raised his head:— Like a thunderbolt the Tigress sped, And the Man fell screaming— Hark! hark! The wild things cry in the dark; The wild Wind whistles and raves, The Beasts groan in their caves, And the Jungle waves. II. 'Ratcliffe Meg. Then methought I saw another sight: Darkness—a Garret—a rushlight dying— On the broken-down bed a Sailor lying, Sleeping fast, in the feeble light;— The Wind is wailing, the Rain is weeping She croucheth there in the chamber dim, She croucheth there with her eyes on him As he lieth sleeping— Hark! hark! Who cries outside in the dark? Only the Wind on its way, Only the wild gusts astray, In Tiger Bay. Still as a child the Sailor lies:— She waits—she watches—is she human? Is she a Tigress? is she a Woman? Look at the gleam of her deep-set eyes! Bloated and stain'd in every feature, With iron jaws, throat knotted and bare, Eyes deep sunken, jet black hair, Crouches the creature. Hark! hark! Who cries outside in the dark? Only the Wind on its way, Only the wild gusts astray, In Tiger Bay. Hold her! scream! or the man is dead; A knife in her tight-clench'd hand is gleaming; She will kill the man as he lieth dreaming! Her eyes are fixed, her throat swells red. The Wind is wailing, the Rain is weeping; She is crawling closer—O Angels that love him! She holds her breath and bends above him, While he stirreth sleeping. Hark! hark! Who cries outside in the dark? Only the Wind on its way, Only the wild gusts astray In Tiger Bay. A silken purse doth the sleeper clutch, And the gold peeps through with a fatal glimmer! She creepeth near—the light grows dimmer— Her thick throat swells, and she thirsts to touch. She looks—she pants with a feverish hunger— She dashes the black hair out of her eyes— She glares at his face . . . he smiles and sighs— And the face looks younger. Hark! hark! Who cries outside in the dark? Only the Wind on its way, Only the wild gusts astray In Tiger Bay. She gazeth on,—he doth not stir— Her fierce eyes close, her brute lip quivers; She longs to strike, but she shrinks and shivers: The light on his face appalleth her. The Wind is wailing, the Rain is weeping: Something holds her—her wild eyes roll; His Soul shines out, and she fears his Soul, Tho' he lieth sleeping. Hark! hark! Who cries outside in the dark? Only the Wind on its way, Only the wild gusts astray In Tiger Bay. III. Intercession. I saw no more, but I woke,—and prayed: ‘God! that made the Beast and the Woman! God of the tigress! God of the human! Look to these things whom Thou hast made! Fierce and bloody and famine-stricken, Knitted with iron vein and thew— Strong and bloody, behold the two!— We see them and sicken. Mark! mark! These outcasts fierce of the dark; Where murmur the Wind and the Rain, Where the Jungle darkens the plain, And in street and lane.’ God answer'd clear, ‘My will be done! Woman-tigress and tigress-woman— I made them both, the beast and the human, But I struck a spark in the brain of the one. And the spark is a fire, and the fire is a spirit; Tho' ye may slay it, it cannot die— Nay, it shall grow as the days go by, For my Angels are near it— Mark! mark! Doth it not burn in the dark? Spite of the curse and the stain, Where the Jungle darkens the plain, And in street and lane.’ God said, moreover: ‘The spark shall grow— 'Tis blest, it gathers, its flame sha lighten, Bless it and nurse it—let it brighten! 'Tis scatter'd abroad, 'tis a Seed I sow. And the Seed is a Soul, and the Soul is the Human; And it lighteth the face with a sign and a flame. Not unto beasts have I given the same, But to man and to woman. Mark! mark! The light shall scatter the dark: Where murmur the Wind and the Rain, Where the Jungle darkens the plain, And in street and lane.’ . . . So faint, so dim, so sad to seeing, Behold it burning! Only a spark! So faint as yet, and so dim to mark, In the tigress-eyes of the human being. Fan it, feed it, in love and duty, Track it, watch it in every place,— Till it burns the bestial frame and face To its own dim beauty. Mark! mark! A spark that grows in the dark; A spark that burns in the brain; Spite of the Wind and the Rain, Spite of the Curse and the Stain; Over the Sea and the Plain, And in street and lane. THE CITY ASLEEP. Still as the Sea serene and deep, When all the winds are laid, The City sleeps—so still, its sleep Maketh the soul afraid. Over the living waters, see! The Seraphs shining go,— The Moon is gliding hushfully Through stars like flakes of snow. In pearl-white silver here and there The fallen moon-rays stream: Hark! a dull stir is in the air, Like the stir of one in dream. Through all the thrilling waters creep Deep throbs of strange unrest, Like washings of the windless Deep When it is peacefullest. A little while—God's breath will go, And hush the flood no more; The dawn will break—the wind will blow, The Ocean rise and roar. Each day with sounds of strife and death The waters rise and call; Each midnight, conquer'd by God's breath, To this dead calm they fall. Out of His heart the fountains flow, The brook, the running river, He marks them strangely come and go, For ever and for ever. Till darker, deeper, one by one, After a weary quest, They, from the light of moon and sun, Flow back, into His breast. Love, hold my hand! be of good cheer! For His would be the cost, If, out of all the waters here, One little drop were lost. Heaven's eyes above the waters dumb Innumerably yearn; Out of His heart each drop hath come, And thither must return. UP IN AN ATTIC. ‘Do you dream yet, on your old rickety sofa, in the dear old ghastly bankrupt garret at No. 66?’—Gray to Buchanan (see The Life of David Gray). Half of a gold-ring bright, Broken in days of old, One yellow curl, whose light Gladden'd my gaze of old; A sprig of thyme thereto, Pluckt on the mountains blue, When in the gloaming-dew We roamed erratic; Last, an old Book of Song,— These have I treasured long, Up in an Attic. Held in one little hand, They gleam in vain to me: Of Love, Fame, Fatherland, All that remain to me! Love, with thy wounded wing, Up the skies lessening, Sighing, too sad to sing! Fame, dead to pity! Land,—that denied me bread! Count me as lost and dead, Tomb'd, in the City. Daily the busy roar, Murmur and motion here; Surging against its shore, Sighs a great Ocean here! But night by night it flows Slowly to strange repose, Calm and more calm it grows Under the moonshine: Then, only then, I peer On each old souvenir Shut from the sunshine. Half of a ring of gold, Tarnish'd and yellow now, Broken in days of old, Where is thy fellow now? Upon the heart of her? Feeling the sweet blood stir, Still (though the mind demur) Kept as a token? Ah! doth her heart forget? Or, with the pain and fret Is that, too, broken? Thin threads of yellow hair, Clipt from the brow of her, Lying so faded there,— Why whisper now of her? Strange lips are press'd unto The brow o'er which ye grew, Strange fingers flutter through The loose long tresses. Doth she remember still, Trembling, and turning chill From his caresses? Sprig from the mountains blue Long left behind me now, Of moonlight, shade, and dew, Wherefore remind me now? Cruel and chill and gray, Looming afar away, Dark in the light of day, Shall the Heights daunt me? My footsteps on the hill Are overgrown,—yet still Hill-echoes haunt me! Book of Byronic Song, Put with the dead away, Wherefore wouldst thou prolong dreams that have fled away? Thou art an eyeless skull, Dead, fleshless, cold, and null, Complexionless, dark, dull, And superseded; Yet, in thy time of pride, How loudly hast thou lied To all who heeded! Now, Fame, thou hollow Voice, Shriek from the heights above! Let all who will rejoice In those wild lights above! When all are false save you, Yet were so beauteous too, O Fame, canst thou be true, And shall I follow? Nay! for the song of Man Dies in his throat, since Pan Hath slain Apollo! O Fame, thy hill looks tame, No vast wings flee from thence,— Were I to climb, O Fame, What could I see from thence? Only, afar away, The mountains looming gray, Crimson'd at close of day, Clouds swimming by me; And in my hand a ring And ringlet glimmering,— And no one nigh me! Better the busy roar, Best the mad motion here! Surging against its shore, Groans a great Ocean here. O Love,—thou wouldst not wait! O Land,—thou art desolate! O Fame,—to others prate Of flights ecstatic! Only, at evenfall, Touching these tokens small, I think about you all, Up in an Attic! TO THE MOON. The wind is shrill on the hills, and the plover Wheels up and down with a windy scream; The birch has loosen'd her bright locks over The nut-brown pools of the mountain stream; Yet here I linger in London City, Thinking of meadows where I was born— And over the roofs, like a face of pity, Up comes the Moon, with her dripping horn. O Moon, pale Spirit, with dim eyes drinking The sheen of the Sun as he sweepeth by, I am looking long in those eyes, and thinking Of one who hath loved thee longer than I; I am asking my heart if ye Spirits cherish The souls that ye witch with a harvest call?— If the dream must die when the dreamer perish?— If it be idle to dream at all? The waves of the world roll hither and thither, The tumult deepens, the days go by, The dead men vanish—we know not whither, The live men anguish—we know not why; The cry of the stricken is smother'd never, The Shadow passes from street to street; And—o'er us fadeth, for ever and ever, The still white gleam of thy constant feet. The hard men struggle, the students ponder, The world rolls round on its westward way; The gleam of the beautiful night up yonder Is dim on the dreamer's cheek all day; The old earth's voice is a sound of weeping, Round her the waters wash wild and vast, There is no calm, there is little sleeping,— Yet nightly, brightly, thou glimmerest past! Another summer, new dreams departed, And yet we are lingering, thou and I; I on the earth, with my hope proud-hearted, Thou, in the void of a violet sky! Thou art there! I am here! and the reaping and mowing Of the harvest year is over and done, And the hoary snow-drift will soon be blowing Under the wheels of the whirling Sun. While tower and turret lie silver'd under, When eyes are closed and lips are dumb, In the nightly pause of the human wonder, From dusky portals I see thee come; And whoso wakes and beholds thee yonder, Is witch'd like me till his days shall cease,— For in his eyes, wheresoever he wander, Flashes the vision of God's white Peace! SPRING SONG IN THE CITY. Who remains in London, In the streets with me, Now that Spring is blowing Warm winds from the sea; Now that trees grow green and tall, Now the Sun shines mellow, And with moist primroses all English lanes are yellow? Little barefoot maiden, Selling violets blue, Hast thou ever pictured Where the sweetlings grew?— Oh, the warm wild woodland ways, Deep in dewy grasses, Where the wind-blown shadow strays, Scented as it passes! Pedlar breathing deeply, Toiling into town, With the dusty highway Thou art dusky brown.— Hast thou seen by daisied leas, And by rivers flowing, Lilac ringlets which the breeze Loosens lightly blowing? Out of yonder waggon Pleasant hay-scents float, He who drives it carries A daisy in his coat: Oh, the English meadows, fair Far beyond all praises! Freckled orchids everywhere Mid the snow of daisies! Now in busy silence Broods the nightingale, Choosing his love's dwelling In a dimpled dale; Round the leafy bower they raise Rose-trees wild are springing; Underneath, thro' the green haze, Bounds the brooklet singing. And his love is silent As a bird can be, For the red buds only Fill the red rose-tree,— Just as buds and blossoms blow He'll begin his tune, When all is green and roses glow Underneath the Moon! Nowhere in the valleys Will the wind be still, Everything is waving, Wagging at his will: Blows the milkmaid's kirtle clean, With her hand prest on it! Lightly o'er the hedge so green Blows the ploughboy's bonnet! Oh, to be a-roaming In an English dell! Every nook is wealthy, All the world looks well, Tinted soft the Heavens glow, Over Earth and Ocean, Brooks flow, breezes blow, All is light and motion! IN LONDON, MARCH 1866. To-day the streets are dull and dreary, Heavily, slowly the Rain is falling, I hear around me, and am weary, The people murmuring and calling; The gloomy room is full of faces, Firelight shadows are on the floor, And the deep Wind cometh from country places, And the Rain hath a voice I would hear no more. Ah! weary days of windy weather! And will the Rain cease never, never! A summer past we sat together, In that lost life that lives for ever! Ah! sad and slow the Rain is falling,— And singing on seems sad without him. Ah! wearily the Wind is calling! Would that mine arms were round about him! For the world rolls on with air and ocean Wetly and windily round and round, And sleeping he feeleth the sad still motion, And dreameth of me, though his sleep be sound! Ah! weary days of windy weather! And will the Rain cease never, never! A summer past we sat together, In that lost life that lives for ever! I sing, because my heart is aching, With hollow sounds around me ringing: Ah! nevermore shall he awaking Yearn to the Singer and the Singing! Yet sleep, my father, calm and breathless, And if thou dreamest, dream on in joy! While over thy grave walks Love the death less, Stir in the darkness, and bless thy boy! Ah! weary days of windy weather! And will the Rain cease never, never! A summer past we sat together, In that lost life that lives for ever! A LARK'S FLIGHT. In the quiet City park, Between the dawn and the dark, Loud and clear, That all may hear, Sings the Lark. Beyond the low black line Of trees the dawn peeps red,— Clouds blow woolly and fine In the ether overhead, Out of the air is shaken A fresh and glistening dew, And the City begins to awaken And tremble thro' and thro'; See! (while thro' street and lane The people pour again, And lane and alley and street Grow hoarse to a sound of feet,) Here and there A human Shape comes, dark Against the cool white air, Flitting across the park— While over the dew-drench'd green, Singing his ‘Hark! Oh, hark!’ Hovering, hovering, dimly seen, Rises the Lark. ‘Mystery! Oh, mystery!’ Clear he lilts to lightening day. ‘Mystery! Oh, mystery! Up into the air with me, Come away, come away!’ Who is she that, wan and white, Shivering in the chilly light, Shadeth weary eyes to see Him who makes the melody? She is nameless, she is dull, She has ne'er been beautiful, She is stain'd in brain and blood, Gross with mire, and foul with mud,— Thing of sorrow, what knows she Of the mighty mystery? The Lark sings sad and low,— ‘The City is dull and mean— There is woe! there is woe! Never a soul is clean; The City is dark, the wrong is deep; Too late to moan, too late to weep! Tired, tired! sleep, sleep!’ Who is he, the stooping one, Smiling coldly in the sun, Arms behind him lightly thrown, Pacing up and down alone? 'Tis the great Philosopher, Smoothly wrapt in coat of fur, Soothly pondering, man-wit wise, At his morning exercise. He has weigh'd the winds and floods, He is rich in gather'd goods, He is crafty, and can prove God is Brahma, Christ, nor Jove; He is mighty, and his soul Flits about from pole to pole, Chasing signs of God about, In a pleasant kind of doubt;— What, to help the mystery, Sings the Lark to such as he? The Lark cries: ‘Praise to Nature's plan! Year on year she plies Her toil of sun and skies, Till the beast flowers up in Man, Lord of effect and cause, Proud as a King can be; But a Voice in the cloud cries, “Pause!” And he pauses, even he, On the verge of the Mystery.’ Oh, loud and clear, that all may hear, Rising higher, with ‘Hark! Oh, hark!’ Higher, higher, higher, higher, Quivering as the dull red fire Of dawn grows brighter, cries the Lark: And they who listen there while he Singeth loud of Mystery, Interpret him in under-tone With a meaning of their own, Measuring his melody By their own soul's quality. Tall and stately, fair and sweet, Walketh maiden Marguerite, Musing there on maid and man, In her mood patrician; To all she sees her eyes impart The colour of a maiden heart; Heart's chastity is on her face, She scents the air with nameless grace, And where she goes with heart astir, Colour and motion follow her. What should the Singer sing Unto so sweet a thing, But, ‘Oh, my love loves me! And the love I love best is guarding the nest, While I cheer her merrily,— Come up high! come up high! to a cloud in the sky! And sing of your love with me!’ Elbows on the grassy green, Scowling face his palms between, Yonder gaunt Thief meditates Treason deep against his mates; For his great hands itch to hold Both the pardon and the gold. Still he listens unaware, Scowling round with sullen stare, Gnawing at his under-lib, Pond'ring friends and fellowship, Thinking of a friendly thing Done to him in suffering, And of happy days and free Spent in that rough companie: Till he seeks the bait no more,— And the Lark is conqueror. For the Lark says plain, ‘Who sells his pal is mean: Better hang than gain Blood-money to save one's skin— A whip for the rogue who'd tell,’ He hears the Singer say,— ‘Better the rope and the cell— Better the devils of Hell! Come away! come away!’ O Lark! O Lark! Up, up, for it is light— The Souls stream out of the dark, And the City's spires gleam bright; The living world is awake again, Each wanders on his way, The wonderful waters break again In the white and perfect Day. Nay! nay! descend not yet, But higher, higher, higher! Up thro' the air, and wet Thy wings in the solar fire! There, hovering in ecstacy, Sing, ‘Mystery! Oh, mystery!’ O Lark! O Lark! hadst thou the might Beyond the cloud to wing thy way, To sing and soar in ceaseless flight, It might be well for men this day. Beyond that cloud there is a zone, And in that zone there is a land, And in that land, upon a throne, A mighty Spirit sits alone, With musing cheek upon His hand. And all is still and all is sweet Around the silence of His seat,— Beneath, the waves of wonder flow,— And melted on His shining feet The years flash down as falling snow. O Lark! O Lark! Up! for thy wings are strong; While the Day is breaking, And the City is waking, Sing a song of wrong— Sing of the weak man's tears, Of the strong man's agony; The passion, the hopes, the fears, The heaped-up pain of the years, The human mystery. O Lark! we might rejoice, Could'st reach that distant land, For we cannot hear His voice, And we often miss His hand! And the lips of each are ice To the kiss of sister and brother; And we see that one man's vice Is the virtue of another. Yea, each that hears thee sing Translates thy song to speech, And, lo! the rendering Is so different with each! The gentle are oppress'd, The foul man fareth best; Wherever we seek, our gain Is full of a poisonous pain. In one soft note and long Gather our sense of wrong; Rise up, O Lark! from the sod, Up, up, with soundless wings,— Rise up to God! rise up, rise up, to God! Tell Him these things! DE BERNY. You knew him slightly. We, who knew him well, Saw something in his soul you could not see: A strength wherein his very vices throve, A power that darken'd much the outer man, Strange, yet angelically innocent. His views were none of ours; his morals—well, Not English morals at the best; and yet We loved him and we miss him;—the old haunts Seem dull without that foolish full-grown child; The world goes on without him:—London throngs With sport and festival; and something less Than poor De Berny haunts us every-where— The buying and the selling, and the strife Of little natures. What a man was that!— Just picture him as you perceived him, Noel, Standing beyond his circle. Spare and tall, Black-bearded and black-eyed; a sallow face, With lines of idle humour round the lips; A nose and eyebrow proudly curved; an eye Clear as a child's. But thirty summers old! Yet wearied out, save only when he warm'd His graces in the sunshine. What an air Was his, when, cigarette in mouth, and hands Thrust in the pockets of his pantaloons, He took his daily walk down Regent Street, Stared at the pretty girls, saluted friends, And, pleased as any lady, stopp'd to study The fashions in the windows of the shops! Did he not walk as if he walk'd on thrones, With smiles of vacant patronage for all? And who could guess he had not break-fasted, Had little chance of dining, since his purse Held just the wherewithal to buy a loaf— Change from the shilling spent in purchasing The sweet post-prandial cigar! He lived— Ah! Heaven knew how—for 'twas a mystery! While the sun shone, he saunter'd in the sun; But late at night sat scribbling, by the light Of a wax-candle. Wax? De Berny's way; For, mark, this wanderer let his body suffer, Hunger'd and pinch'd, rather than bate a jot Of certain very useless luxuries: Smoked nought but real Havannah, 'tis averr'd, And sat at night within his dingy lodging, Wrapt, king-like, in a costly dressing-gown His mother gave him; slippers on his feet; His cat, Mignonne, the silken-hair'd Chinese, Seated upon his shoulder, purring low; And something royal in his look, despite His threadbare pantaloons! A clever man! A nature sparkling o'er with jeux d' esprit! Well read in certain light philosophies Down from Voltaire; and, in his easy way, A sceptic—one whose heart belied his brain. Oft, leaning back and puffing his cigar, Pushing his wan white fingers through his hair— His cat Mignonne, the velvet-paw'd Chinese, Rubbing her soft white cheek against his beard, And purring her approval—he would sit, Smiling his sad, good-humour'd, weary smile, And lightly launch his random, reckless shafts At English thrift, the literary cant, The flat, unearnest living of the world, And (last and lightest) at the tender sex, Their little virtue and their mighty vows. This was the man whose face went pale with pain, When that shrill shriek from Poland fill'd his ear; This was the man who pinch'd himself to send A mite to Garibaldi and the Cause; Who cried, or nearly cried, o'er Lamartine, And loved the passionate passages of Sand; Who would have kiss'd the ground beneath the feet Of any shape called ‘Woman,’ plain or fair; Gave largess royal to children in the streets; Treated an unclean beggar seeking alms To a clean shirt, and sent him off amazed; And when he heard sweet voice or instrument, Breath'd passionate breath, like one that drinks with pain An atmosphere too heavenly rare and sweet. Pleasure? Ah me! what pleasure garner'd he, Who fasted oftener than ate; who pawn'd His coat to serve a neighbour, and was cold; Whose only little joy was promenading On sunny summer days in Regent Street? His talk? Why, how he talk'd, as I have said; Incubus could not prove his neighbours worse, Or himself blacker, or the cold world colder; His jests so oft too broad for decent ears, His impiousness so insolently strong, His languid grace so callous unto all Save the sad sunshine that it flutter'd in. Yet, Noel, I could swear that Spirits—those Who see beneath the eyes, and hear the breathing The Soul makes as it stirs within the breast— Bent not unlovingly, not angrily, Above that weary, foolish, full-grown Child! Weary—of what? Weary, I think, for want Of something whose existence he denied; Not sick of life, since he had never felt The full of living—wearied out, because The world look'd falsehood, and his turn was truth. Well, late one morning in the summer time, They found him lying in his easy-chair, Wrapt royally in the costly dressing-gown His mother gave him, slippers on his feet, And something royal in his look,—cold, dead! A smell of laudanum sicken'd all the air Around him; on the table at his side A copy of De Musset's Elle et Lui; And close at hand a crumpled five-pound note, On which was written in his round clear hand ‘Pour Garibaldi. Vive la Liberté!’ THE WAKE OF TIM O'HARA. (SEVEN DIALS.) To the Wake of O'Hara Came company; All St. Patrick's Alley Was there to see, With the friends and kinsmen Of the family. On the long deal table lay Tim in white, And at his pillow the burning light. Pale as himself, with the tears on her cheek, The mother received us, too full to speak; But she heap'd the fire, and on the board Set the black bottle with never a word, While the company gather'd, one and all, Men and women, big and small— Not one in the Alley but felt a call To the Wake of Tim O'Hara. At the face of O'Hara, All white with sleep, Not one of the women But took a peep, And the wives new-wedded Began to weep. The mothers gather'd round about, And praised the linen and lying-out,— For white as snow was his winding-sheet, And all was peaceful, and clean, and sweet; And the old wives, praising the blessëd dead, Were thronging around the old press-bed, Where O'Hara's widow, tatter'd and torn, Held to her bosom the babe new-born, And stared all round her, with eyes forlorn, At the Wake of Tim O'Hara. For the heart of O'Hara Was good as gold, And the life of O'Hara Was bright and bold, And his smile was precious To young and old! Gay as a guinea, wet or dry, With a smiling mouth, and a twinkling eye! Had ever an answer for chaff and fun; Would fight like a lion, with any one! Not a neighbour of any trade But knew some joke that the boy had made; Not a neighbour, dull or bright, But minded something—frolic or fight, And whisper'd it round the fire that night, At the Wake of Tim O'Hara! ‘To God be glory In death and life, He's taken O'Hara From trouble and strife!’ Said one-eyed Biddy, The apple-wife. ‘God bless old Ireland!’ said Mistress Hart, Mother to Mike of the donkey-cart; ‘God bless old Ireland till all be done, She never made wake for a better son!’ And all join'd chorus, and each one said Something kind of the boy that was dead; And the bottle went round from lip to lip, And the weeping widow, for fellowship, Took the glass of old Biddy and had a sip, At the Wake of Tim O'Hara. Then we drank to O'Hara, With drams to the brim, While the face of O'Hara Look'd on so grim In the corpse-light shining Yellow and dim, The cup of liquor went round again, And the talk grew louder at every drain, Louder the tongues of the women grew!— The lips of the boys were loosening too! The widow her weary eyelids closed, And, soothed by the drop o' drink, she dozed; The mother brighten'd and laugh'd to hear Of O'Hara's fight with the grenadier, And the hearts of all took better cheer, At the Wake of Tim O'Hara. Tho' the face of O'Hara Lookt on so wan, In the chimney-corner The row began— Lame Tony was in it, The oyster-man; For a dirty low thief from the North came near, And whistled ‘Boyne Water’ in his ear, And Tony, with never a word of grace, Flung out his fist in the blackguard's face; And the girls and women scream'd out for-fright, And the men that were drunkest began to fight,— Over the tables and chairs they threw,— The corpse-light tumbled,—the trouble grew,— The new-born joined in the hullabaloo,— At the Wake of Tim O'Hara. ‘Be still! be silent! Ye do a sin! Shame be his portion Who dares begin!’ 'Twas Father O'Connor Just enter'd in!— All look'd down, and the row was done— And shamed and sorry was every one; But the Priest just smiled quite easy and free— ‘Would ye wake the poor boy from his sleep?’ said he; And he said a prayer, with a shining face, Till a kind of a brightness filled the place; The women lit up the dim corpse-light, The men were quieter at the sight, And the peace of the Lord fell on all that night At the Wake of Tim O'Hara! KITTY KEMBLE. ‘All the world's a stage.’ Draw softly back the curtains of the bed— Aye, here lies Kitty Kemble cold and dead: Poor Kitty Kemble, if I steal a kiss, Who deems the deed amiss? Cold bloodless cheek whereon there lingers faint The crimson dye of a life's rouge and paint; Cold lips that fall, since thy false rows of teeth No longer prop the toothless gums beneath; Cold clammy brow that lies there bald and bare No longer screen'd and shadow'd by false hair; Poor Kitty Kemble! is it truly thou On whom I look so very sadly now? Lightest of ladies, is thy mortal race Run out indeed, thy luminous laughing face Turn'd to this mindless mask of marble dead? And even thy notes of tinkling laughter fled, Which, when all other charms to please were past, Stay'd with thee till the last? God bless thee, Kitty Kemble!—and God love thee! Warm be the kindred earth that lies above thee— Lightest of ladies, never sad or sage, A glad coquette at sixty years of age, And even with thy last expiring breath Flirting thy fan at thy lean Lover, Death! Tho' nature made you volatile and witty, Your parents were most vulgar people, Kitty; Hard work was daily yours, and trouble maybe To mind the wretched house and nurse the baby, While to the third-class Theatre hard by Your father and your mother both did hie, Mother as dresser, while with surly mien Toil'd father as a shifter of the scene; And thus it happen'd that you early grew Familiar with the British drama too, And thro' the dusty stage-door you would steal With father's midday beer or evening meal, Until that blissful day when to your glee The keen-eyed ballet-master noticed thee, And quickly, being a bright and clever girl, You learnt from him to dance and twist and twirl, Leaping ere long before the garish lights, A smiling spangled creature in pink tights. Aye, Kitty, and the common scandal says The ballet-master in those early days, Finding you quick and rapidly advancing, Taught you love's dalliance as well as dancing! But you were very clever; and ere long Were brightest, smartest of the ballet throng; No lighter trimmer leg was to be seen When you were only rising seventeen, And from the stalls to your sweet guileless eyes Ogles and nods and smiles began to rise. Then later, like a wise girl and a pretty, You chose to bless a close man from the City, Quiet, respectable, and most demure With a stiff salary and prospects sure; And him, my dear, you used for your ambition Still bent of course to better your position. For tho' so light and merry, you were ever Ambitious, Kitty, quick and bright and clever; And now you got your educated lover To hear you read the British drama over, To criticise your clever imitations Of the tall leading lady's declamations, And to correct your tone, and guide your tongue, Whenever you pronounced your English wrong; And tho' the fellow was in soul a bore, And had no intellect to help you more, You got in this Bohemian sort of college Some gleams of grace and scraps of solid knowledge; And while your silly sisters took repose You grew grammatical, as grammar goes. O Kitty, what a lavish little elf Thou wast, yet economic of thyself! So free, so merry, and innocent of guile; And yet at heart so busy, all the while You danced and dallied with those sparkling eyes, In weighty speculations how to rise! Yes, Kitty, and you rose; ere long you made The prettiest, wittiest sort of chambermaid (That saucy female elf of the stage-inn, Chuck'd by each handsome guest beneath the chin; A nymph oft carrying a warming-pan, And sweetheart of the comic waiting-man) Or haply, on extravaganza nights, As a slim fairy prince in trunks and tights, You pertly spake a dozen lines or so, While just behind you, glaring in a row, Your sillier sisters of the ballet stood, With spleen and envy raging in their blood! Thus, Kitty Kemble, on and up you went, Merry, yet ill content; And soon you cast, inflated still with pride, Your City man aside, Cut him stone dead to his intense annoy, And, like a maiden coy, Dropt, blushing crimson, in the arms scarce vital Of an old man of title! A sad dyspeptic dog, the worn and yellow Wreck of a handsome fellow, And tho' the lord of boundless rolls and lands, Just a mere puppet in your pretty hands. O Kitty Kemble, how you coaxed and teased him, Nursed him and pain'd him, petted him and pleased him, Drove him nigh crazy, made his slow blood start With the glad beating of your burning heart, Until he vowed, you managed him so neatly, To marry you completely; And with this view transmitted you, poor fool, To a French boarding-school; And there you taught, I fear, your power being such, More than you learnt tho' what you learnt was much! O you were still and patient as a mouse, Much as your spirit hated the strict house, The teachers grim, the insipid simpering misses, The walks—so different from the coulisses! There learning patiently did you abide, Till one fine morning your protector died, And once again, alas! as in times past. On the hard world your gentle lot was cast. But, Kitty, what a change in you was made By those few seasons wintering in the shade; In like a common moth you crept full sly, But out you came a perfect butterfly! A pretty little sparkling wench, Prattling so prettily in French, Or dashing off, with fingers white, Gay little scraps of music bright; Merry and wicked, and not wise, With babies dancing in her eyes, Most apt at quoting saw and joke From Shakespeare and less famous folk, Making the ignorant listener stare With charming mots from Molière! But, Kitty Kemble, 'tis not given to me To write in full your fair biography. About this very time from English sight Your pretty little figure vanished quite; And dainty rivals came and conquered here, And the false world forgot you quite, I fear. I think your next appearance in our view Was in a blaze of splendour bright and new, When, after many years of preparation, Provincial trial, trouble, and vexation, Out you emerged on the astonish'd City, The town's delight, the beaux', the critics', Kitty! The brightest wonder human eye could see In good old Comedy: A smile, a voice, a laugh a look, a form, To take the world by storm! A dainty dimpling intellectual treasure To give old stagers pleasure! A rippling radiant cheek—a roguish eye— That made the youngsters sigh! And thus beneath a tinsel'd pasteboard Star At once you mounted your triumphant car, O'er burning hearts your chariot wheels were driven, Bouquets came rolling down like rain from heaven, And on we dragged you, Kitty, while you stood Roguish and great, not innocent and good, The Queen Elect of all Light Womanhood! Yes, Kitty Kemble, let the preacher cry His word of ‘Vanity, O Vanity!’ But those, I think, were happy, happy days. Indeed, yours was a life that throve with praise, And brighten'd; passionate and eager; made To love the lamp-light and to hate the shade; To play with happiness and drink the beam Till it suffused your substance gleam by gleam, Making of elements past your control The smiling semblance of a living Soul. In sooth, you were a summer creature, one Who never really throve save in the sun; And take away its perfect self-content, Your very beauty grew indifferent. Further, you did not crave for love or fame, Or that still colder shadow—a good name; You were not even avaricious (tho' 'Twas sweet, of course, to see the guineas grow). Nay, Kitty, all your care and your delight Was to gleam past upon the public sight, To gleam, to smile, to sparkle, and depart Ere sympathy could reach your little heart; To let the flaming footlights underneath Light up your rouge, whiten your spotless teeth, And to those eyes, so luminous and bright, Dart beams of glorious artificial light; To feel your bright and lissom body free In brightly-hued theatric drapery; And on your skin, as white as morning milk, The clinging satin and the slippery silk. In private life 'twas your delight to be The beauty of Bohemian revelry; To the smart little literary man Whispering wicked jests behind your fan, And not at all too nice in modesty As to reject a dinner vis-à-vis At Kew or Richmond, freely sipping port With hirsute critics of the heavier sort, And oft enough on such a holiday Opening at last your own small purse to pay! Beneath your beauty, rouged, and ring'd, and pearled, You were at heart the woman of the world, Not quite forgetting yet (tho' well content Quite to forget) your very low descent; And having gained your little life's endeavour, You could, I know, have deemed it bliss for ever. For ever, Kitty Kemble? Ah, my child! (Surely thou art a child at last?) When days and nights are glad and wild, They whirl the quicklier past! To Sorrow's faintest funeral symphony Time lingers darken'd steps dejectedly With sad eyes heavenward; but how fleet he flies When Revel sings and Mirth doth melodize! Thy merry laughter and thy gay delight Quicken'd the Greybeard's footsteps day and night, And Kitty, suddenly, to thy surprise, The cruel crowsfeet gather'd 'neath thine eyes. But paint is bright, and powder pearly white, And many merry years, in that fierce light Which beats on thrones and faces like to thine, Thy ways were witching and thy lot divine. Thy life was surely glad. The need was fled Long since of choosing lovers for thy bread Or thine advancement, and thou now wert free To pick at will thy male society. All that is dark. We laymen cannot tell What amatory happiness befell; We only know for certain Cupid's dart Ne'er struck so deadly deep into thy heart, As to befool our Kitty into passion Of the mad vulgar fashion. We only know thou, Kitty, ever wert Lightest of ladies, delicate and pert, Clever and quick, and horribly well read. And as the happy seasons o'er thee fled Thy bust swelled out, thy body fresh and fair Grew plumper, and thou didst assume thine air, Round, roguish, royal, dazzling, plump, and good, Of most delicious demi-matronhood. I think we loved thee even better then Than ever, Kitty; all the older men, I know, adored thee! and thou wert supreme, Yea, grand above all modern guess or dream, In wanton Widows, those we love to see In unctuous Shakespearian comedy. Great wast thou also, Kitty, great and true, As the bold Beatrice in ‘Much Ado’; And all the mighty Town went raving mad To see thy ‘Lady Teazle.’ Wild and glad Rolled the years onward, and thy little heart (Tho' certainly thy stoniest, toughest part) Was just enough at least to act with. Well! At forty summers still thy fortune fell On pleasant places; for a little yet The fickle British public loved its pet. True, here and there, thy features, still so pretty, Were sharpening into shrewish lines, my Kitty; And nose and chin, though still most soft and sweet, Seem'd slowly journeying on the way to meet! A certain shrillness in the voice's tone, Which from the very first had been thine own, But rather pleased the ear than otherwise When thou hadst fleeter feet and younger eyes, Grew harsher and more harsh upon the ear. Never, indeed, in any earlier year Hadst thou performed so perfectly as now, And yet the cruel British Critic's brow Grew cloudy. Vain were trick of tone or smile To hide the artful, artificial style, The superficial tones, the airs capricious, That in thy younger days had been delicious. O Kitty, all thy being's constant pain To win the heart once more was wholly vain; Most vain, most piteous! Thy familiar airs Were met by only vacant shrugs and stares, Thy tricks, thy jokes, thy jests, thy wanton ways, Awakened only pity and amaze; And presently, when thou didst rashly try A fair young part, as in the days gone by, Down on thee came the cruel Critic's bludgeon, Out spoke at last the oracular Curmudgeon, Hinting out openly, in accents cold, That thou wert passée, past thy prime, and old, The ghost of loveliness and lightness, fit To play old women,—better still to quit The Stage for ever. O poor thing! poor thing! The cruel knife cut deep enough to bring The sad blood from your very heart at last; You winced, you smirked, you struggled, and at last You seem'd to triumph; and the bitter truth That thou hadst spent thy previous years of youth Was taken home indeed to thy fair breast, And there, like to a very viper's nest, It bred and flourish'd. Kitty, tho' thy face Was merry still in many a public place, Thy shrill laugh loud, thy manner brazen bold, Black was thy soul and piteously cold. Anon into the country thou didst fare, And spend a brighter, happier season there; Bearing about with thee from year to year The shadow of thine earlier triumphs here. That passed, like all the rest. Ah me! ah me! Even the provinces deserted thee, As we had done; so our poor Kitty came To be the lonely ghost of a great name— A worn and wanton woman, not yet sage Nor wearied out, tho' sixty years of age, Wrinkled and rouged, and with false teeth of pearl, And the shrill laughter of a giddy girl; Haunting, with painted cheek and powder'd brow, The private boxes, as spectator now; Both day and night, indeed, invited out To private picnic and to public rout, Because thy shrill laugh and thy ready joke Ever enlivened up the festal folk; Nor did such people woo thy service less Because of tales of thy past wickedness Oh, thou wert very clever, keen, and bright, Most gay, most scandal-loving, and most light! Still greatly given to French literature, And foreign feuilletons not over pure; Still highly rouging up thy cheek so dead Into a ghostly gleam of rosy red: Still ever ready talking with a man, To tap his naughty knuckles with thy fan Coquettishly, and meanwhile with thy dim Yet lustrous eyes to smile and ogle him! Yet ever with a lurking secret sense Of thine own beauty's utter impotence, With hungry observation all the while To catch the covert sneer or lurking smile— A helpless fear, a pang, a sharp distress, Curdling thy choicest mirth to bitterness. Sad years, my child, sad years of lonely gloom! Nor let the hasty Moralist assume Neglect and age and agony could be God's ruthless instruments to chasten thee. Nay, Kitty Kemble, tho' thy spirit grew Still bitterer as the seasons flash'd and flew, Thy bright face ne'er one moment turned away From the glad gaudy world of every day. I know religion never moved thy thought, Comfort in God was neither found nor sought. Still thou wert happiest, happiest and best By the old gaslight, rouged and gaily drest. At each new play thy well-known face was seen, Merry and quick, yet hiding secret spleen; At each new brilliant débutante's success Thy soul did wince for very bitterness;— And all the taste of thy departed power Was gall and wormwood on thy soul each hour; And never, Kitty, till thy latest breath, Didst thou remember God, the Soul, and Death. Yet very quietly, one wintry day, Death's pale and unseen footsteps past thy way, And as Death swiftly sail'd upon the air, He lightly breathed one breath upon thee there As a reminder;—after that thy face Changed very strangely; shrivell'd in its place; One helpless eyelid fluttered, and thy faint Dark cheek contracted underneath thy paint: And after that same day thy speech was ne'er Quite constant to thy thought, or wholly clear; And ev'n thy very thought at times would seem Suddenly to dissolve away in dream! Yet, Kitty Kemble, to the last we found thee Constant to the old haunts of life around thee, Still in the public gaslight thou wert seen, Tho' now upon a staff compelled to lean, Thine eyes still black and quick, thy tones and words Still gay, thy laugh shrill as a mocking bird's! Ah! but I think thy heavenly Sire was near His daughter's dwelling-place at last, my dear! That quiet day I looked upon thee last, I had called at midday as thy porch I passed, Found thee ‘from home,’ and past the quiet door Away was turning, when, from the first floor, Thy quick voice called me; and upstairs I went, To find my lady lying indolent, Pillow'd in state upon her stately bed, A pretty ribbon'd night-cap on her head, While on her hollow cheeks false hectic bloom Strange shade fell sadly from the darken'd room. And there upon thy pillow, partly read, Feydeau's last fever-piece; around thee spread Old playbills, pink and yellow, white and green, Whereon in mighty capitals was seen Thine own triumphant name. Alas! alas! Shall I forget till life and memory pass Thy look of blended pleasure, pride, and pain, Thy eager laughter, garrulous and vain, Thy tremulous, feverish voice and fretful glee, As thou didst prattle, pointing out to me, With a lean, palsied finger, dead and cold, Thy mighty triumphs in the days of old? And suddenly (my child, shall I forget?— The voice, the tone, the look, all linger yet!) The feverish emotion grew too much; And with a passionate, spasmodic clutch, Thou didst against my shoulder wildly press Thy cheek, once warm with life and loveliness, And moaning madly over thy lost years Hysterically break to bitterest tears! What comfort could I give? ere, once more gay, Thou with light hand didst sweep the tears away, And break, with fretful wish and eager will, To laughter sadder still; Prattling, in thy most artificial tone, Words to make Angels moan! And here's the end of all. And on thy bed Thou liest, Kitty Kemble, lone and dead; And on thy clammy cheek there lingers faint The deep dark stain of a life's rouge and paint; And, Kitty, all thy sad days and thy glad Have left thee lying for thy last part clad, Cold, silent, on the earthly Stage; and while Thou liest there with dark and dreadful smile, The feverish footlights of the World flash bright Into thy face with a last hastly light; And while thy friends all sighing rise to go, The great black Curtain droppeth, slow, slow, slow, God help us! We spectators turn away; Part sad, we think, part merry, was the Play. God help the lonely player now she stands Behind the darken'd scenes with wondering face, And gropes her way at last, with clay-cold hands, Out of the dingy place, Turning towards Home, poor worn and weary one, Now the last scene is done. THE SWALLOWS. I. O Churchyard in the city's gloom, What charm to please hast thou, That, seated on a broken tomb, I muse so oft, as now? The dreary autumn wind goes murmuring by, And in the distant streets the ragged urchins cry. Thou holdest in thy sunless land Nought I have seen or known, No lips I ever kissed, no hand That ever clasped mine own; And all is still and dreary to the eye,— The broken tombs, dark walls, roofed by a sunless sky. Now to the murmur that mine ears Catch from the distant lanes, Dimming mine eyes with dreamy tears, Slow, low, my heart refrains; And the live grass creeps up from thy dead bones, And crawls, with slimy stains, over thy gray gravestones. The cries keep on, the minutes pass, Mine eyes are on the ground, The silent many-fingered grass Winds round, and round, and round: I seem to see it live, and stir, and wind, And gaze, until a weight is heavy on my mind. II. O Churchyard in the shady gloom, What charm to please hast thou, That, seated on a broken tomb, I muse so oft, as now? Haply because I learn, with sad content, How small a thing can make the whole world different! Among the gravestones worn and old, A sad sweet hour I pass, Where thickest from thy sunless mould Upsprings the sickly grass; For, though the earth holds no sweet smelling flower, The Swallows build their nests up in thy square gray tower. While, burthened by the life we bear, The dull and creeping woe, The mystery, the pain, the care, I watch thy grasses grow, Sighing, I look to the dull autumn skies, And, lo! my heart is cheered, and tears are in mine eyes. For here, where stillness, death, and dream, Brood above creeping things, Over mine eyes with quick bright gleam Shine little flashing wings. And a strange comfort takes thy shady air, And the deep life I breathe seems sweetened unaware! TOM DUNSTAN; OR, THE POLITICIAN. ‘How long, O Lord, how long?’ I Now poor Tom Dunstan's cold, Our shop is duller; Scarce a tale is told, And our talk has lost its old Red-republican colour! Though he was sickly and thin, 'Twas a sight to see his face,— While, sick of the country's sin, With bang of the fist, and chin Thrust out, he argued the case! He prophesied men should be free! And the money-bags be bled! ‘She's coming, she's coming!’ said he; ‘Courage, boys! wait and see! Freedom's ahead!’ II All day we sat in the heat, Like spiders spinning, Stitching full fine and fleet, While old Moses on his seat Sat greasily grinning; And here Tom said his say, And prophesied Tyranny's death; And the tallow burned all day, And we stitch'd and stitch'd away In the thick smoke of our breath. Weary, weary were we, Our hearts as heavy as lead; But ‘Patience! she's coming!’ said he; ‘Courage, boys! wait and see! Freedom's ahead!’ III And at night, when we took here The rest allowed to us, The Paper came, with the beer, And Tom read, sharp and clear, The news out loud to us; And then, in his witty way, He threw the jests about: The cutting things he'd say Of the wealthy and the gay! How he turn'd 'em inside out! And it made our breath more free To hearken to what he said— ‘She's coming! she's coming!’ said he; ‘Courage, boys! wait and see! Freedom's ahead!’ IV But grim Jack Hart, with a sneer, Would mutter, ‘Master! If Freedom means to appear, I think she might step here A little faster!’ Then, 'twas fine to see Tom flame, And argue, and prove, and preach, Till Jack was silent for shame,— Or a fit of coughing came O' sudden, to spoil Tom's speech. Ah! Tom had the eyes to see When Tyranny should be sped: ‘She's coming! she's coming!’ said he ‘Courage, boys! wait and see! Freedom's ahead!’ V But Tom was little and weak, The hard hours shook him; Hollower grew his cheek, And when he began to speak The coughing took him. Ere long the cheery sound Of his chat among us ceased, And we made a purse, all round, That he might not starve, at least. His pain was sorry to see, Yet there, on his poor sick-bed, ‘She's coming, in spite of me! Courage, and wait!’ cried he; ‘Freedom's ahead!’ VI A little before he died, To see his passion! ‘Bring me a Paper!’ he cried, And then to study it tried, In his old sharp fashion; And with eyeballs glittering, His look on me he bent, And said that savage thing Of the Lords o' the Parliament. Then, dying, smiling on me, ‘What matter if one be dead? She's coming at last!’ said he; ‘Courage, boy! wait and see; Freedom's ahead!’ VII Ay, now Tom Dunstan's cold, The shop feels duller; Scarce a tale is told, And our talk has lost the old Red-republican colour. But we see a figure gray, And we hear a voice of death, And the tallow burns all day, And we stitch and stitch away In the thick smoke of our breath; Ay, while in the dark sit we, Tom seems to call from the dead— ‘She's coming! she's coming!’ says he; ‘Courage, boys! wait and see! Freedom's ahead!’ How long, O Lord! how long Must thy Handmaid linger— She who shall right the wrong, Make the poor sufferer strong? Sweet morrow, bring her! Hasten her over the sea, O Lord! ere Hope be fled! Bring her to men and to me! . . . O Slave, pray still on thy knee, ‘Freedom 's ahead!’ O'MURTOGH. (NEWGATE, 18?) ‘It's a sight to see a bold man die!’ To-night we drink but a sorrowful cup . . Hush! silence! and fill your glasses up. Christ be with us! Hold out and say: ‘Here's to the Boy that died this day!’ Wasn't he bold as the boldest here? Red coat or black did he ever fear? With the bite and the drop, too, ever free? He died like a man. . . . I was there to see! The gallows was black, our cheeks were white All underneath in the morning light; The bell ceased tolling swift as thought, And out the murdered Boy was brought. There he stood in the daylight dim, With a Priest on either side of him; Each Priest look'd white as he held his book, But the man between had a brighter look! Over the faces below his feet His gray eye gleam'd so keen and fleet: He saw us looking; he smiled his last . . . He couldn't wave, he was pinioned fast. This was more than one could bear, For the lass who loved him was with us there; She stood in the rain with her dripping shawl Over her head, for to see it all. But when she met the Boy's last look, Her lips went white, she turned and shook; She didn't scream, she didn't groan, But down she dropt as dead as stone. He saw the stir in the crowd beneath, And I saw him tremble and set his teeth; But the hangman came with a knavish grace And drew the nightcap over his face. Then I saw the Priests, who still stood near, Pray faster and faster to hide their fear; They closed their eyes, I closed mine too. And the deed was over before I knew. The crowd that stood all round of me Gave one dark plunge like a troubled sea; And I knew by that the deed was done, And I opened my eyes and saw the sun. The gallows was black, the sun was white, There he hung, half hid from sight; The sport was over, the talk grew loud, And they sold their wares to the mighty crowd. We walked away with our hearts full sore, And we met a hawker before a door, With a string of papers an arm's-length long, A dying speech and a gallows song. It bade all people of poor estate Beware of O'Murtogh's evil fate; It told how in old Ireland's name He had done red murther and come to shame. Never a word was sung or said Of the murder'd mother, a ditch her bed, Who died with her newborn babe that night, While the blessed cabin was burning bright. Nought was said of the years of pain, The starving stomach, the madden'd brain, The years of sorrow and want and toil, And the murdering rent for the bit of soil. Nought was said of the murther done On man and woman and little one, Of the bitter sorrow and daily smart Till he put cold lead in the traitor's heart. But many a word had the speech beside: How he repented before he died; How, brought to sense by the sad event, He prayed for the Queen and the Parliament! What did we do, and mighty quick, But tickle that hawker's brains with a stick; And to pieces small we tore his flam, And left him quiet as any lamb! Pass round your glasses! now lift them up! Powers above, 'tis a bitter cup! Christ be with us! Hold out and say: ‘Here's to the Boy that died this day!’ Here's his health!—for bold he died; Here's his health!—and it's drunk in pride: The finest sight beneath the sky Is to see how bravely a man can die. THE BOOKWORM. With spectacles upon his nose, He shuffles up and down; Of antique fashion are his clothes, His napless hat is brown. A mighty watch, of silver wrought, Keeps time in sun or rain To the dull ticking of the thought Within his dusty brain. To see him at the bookstall stand And bargain for the prize, With the odd sixpence in his hand And greed in his gray eyes! Then, conquering, grasp the book half blind, And take the homeward track, For fear the man should change his mind, And want the bargain back! The waves of life about him beat, He scarcely lifts his gaze, He hears within the crowded street The wash of ancient days. If ever his short-sighted eyes Look forward, he can see Vistas of dusty Libraries Prolonged eternally. But think not as he walks along His brain is dead and cold; His soul is thinking in the tongue Which Plato spake of old; And while some grinning cabman sees His quaint shape with a jeer, He smiles,—for Aristophanes Is joking in his ear. Around him stretch Athenian walks, And strange shapes under trees; He pauses in a dream and talks Great speech, with Socrates. Then, as the fancy fails—still mesh'd In thoughts that go and come— Feels in his pouch, and is refresh'd At touch of some old tome. The mighty world of humankind Is as a shadow dim, He walks through life like one half blind, And all looks dark to him; But put his nose to leaves antique, And hold before his sight Some press'd and withered flowers of Greek, And all is life and light. A blessing on his hair so gray, And coat of dingy brown! May bargains bless him every day, As he goes up and down; Long may the bookstall-keeper's face, In dull times, smile again, To see him round with shuffling pace The corner of the lane! A good old Ragpicker is he, Who, following morn and eve The quick feet of Humanity, Searches the dust they leave. He pokes the dust, he sifts with care, He searches close and deep; Proud to discover, here and there, A treasure in the heap! THE LAST OF THE HANGMEN. A GROTESQUE. What place is snugger and more pretty Than a gay green Inn outside the City, To sit in an arbour in a garden, With a pot of ale and a long churchwarden! Amid the noise and acclamation, He sits unknown, in meditation: 'Mid church-bells ringing, jingling glasses, Snugly enough his Sunday passes. Beyond the suburbs of the City, where Cheap stucco'd villas on the brick-field stare, Where half in town, half country, you espy The hay-cart standing at the hostelry,— Strike from the highway down a puddly lane, Skirt round a market-garden, and you gain A pastoral footpath, winding on for miles By fair green fields and over country stiles; And soon, as you proceed, the busy sound Of the dark City at your back is drowned, The speedwell with its blue eye looks at you, The yellow primrose glimmers through the dew; Out of the sprouting hedgerow at your side, Instead of the town sparrow starveling-eyed, The blackbird whistles and the finches sing; Instead of smoke, you breathe the pleasant Spring; And shading eyes dim from street dust you mark, With soft pulsations soaring up, the Lark, Till o'er your head, a speck against the gleam, He sings, and the great City fades in dream! Five miles the path meanders; then again You reach the road, but like a leafy lane It wanders now; and lo! you stand before A quaint old country Inn, with open door, Fresh-watered troughs, and the sweet smell of hay. And if, perchance, it be the seventh day— Or any feast-day, calendar'd or not— Merry indeed will be this smiling spot; For on the neighbouring common will be seen Groups from the City, romping on the green; The vans with gay pink curtains empty stand, The horses graze unharness'd close at hand; Bareheaded wenches play at games in rings, Or, strolling, swing their bonnets by the strings; 'Prentices, galloping with gasp and groan, On donkeys ride, till out of breath, or thrown; False gipsies, with pale cheeks by juice stain'd brown, And hulking loungers, gather from the town. The fiddle squeaks, they dance, they sing, they play, Waifs from the City casting care away, And with the country smells and sights are blent Loud town-bred oaths and urban merriment. Ay; and behind the Inn are gardens green, And arbours snug, where families are seen Tea-drinking in the shadow; some, glad souls, On the smooth-shaven carpet play at bowls; And half-a-dozen, rowing round and round, Upon the shallow skating-pond are found, And ever and anon will one of these Upset, and stand there, wading to the knees, Righting his crank canoe! Down neighbouring walks Go 'prentice lovers in delightful talks; While from the arbour-seats smile pleasantly The older members of the company; And plump round matrons sweat in Paisley shawls, And on the grass the crowing baby sprawls. Now hither, upon such a festal day, I from my sky-high lodging made my way, And followed straggling feet with summer smile; ‘Jog on,’ I sung, ‘and merrily hent the stile,’ Until I reached the place of revelry; And there, hard by the groups who sat at tea, But in a quiet arbour, cool and deep, Around whose boughs white honeysuckles creep, A Face I saw familiar to my gaze, In scenes far different and on darker days:— An aged man, with white and reverent hair, Brow patriarchal yet deep-lined with care, His melancholy eye, in a half dream, Watching the groups with philosophic gleam; Decent his dress, of broadcloth black and clean, Clean-starch'd his front, and dignified his mien. His right forefinger busy in the bowl Of a long pipe of clay, whence there did roll A halo of gray vapour round his face, He sat, like the wise Genius of the place; And at his left hand on the table stood A pewter-pot, filled up with porter good, Which ever and anon, with dreamy gaze And arm-sweep proud, he to his lips did raise. 'Twas Sunday; and in melancholy swells Came the low music of the soft church-bells, Scarce audible, blown o'er the meadows green, Out of the cloud of London dimly seen— Whence, thro' the summer mist, at intervals, We caught the far-off shadow of St. Paul's. Silent he sat, unnoted in the crowd, With all his greatness round him like a cloud, Unknown, unwelcomed, unsuspected quite, Smoking his pipe like any common wight; Cheerful, yet distant, patronising here The common gladness from his prouder sphere. Cold was his eye, and ominous now and then The look he cast upon those merry men Around him; and, from time to time, sadeyed, He rolled his reverent head from side to side With dismal shake; and, his sad heart to cheer, Hid his great features in the pot of beer. When, with an easy bow and lifted hat, I enter'd the green arbour where he sat, And most politely him by name did greet, He went as white as any winding-sheet! Yea, trembled like a man whose lost eyes note A pack of wolves upleaping at his throat! But when, in a respectful tone and kind, I tried to lull his fears and soothe his mind, And vowed the fact of his identity Was as a secret wholly safe with me— Explaining also, seeing him demur, That I too was a public character— The Great Unknown (as I shall call him here) Grew calm, replenish'd soon his pot of beer At my expense, and in a little while His tongue began to wag, his face to smile; And in the simple self-revealing mode Of all great natures heavy with the load Of pride and power, he edged himself more near, And poured his griefs and wrongs into mine ear. ‘Well might I be afraid, and sir to you! They'd tear me into pieces if they knew,— For quiet as they look, and bright, and smart, Each chap there has a tiger in his heart! At play they are, but wild beasts all the same— Not to be teased although they look so tame; And many of them, plain as eye can trace, Have got my 'scutcheon figured on the face. It's all a matter of mere destiny Whether they go all right or come to me: Mankind is bad, sir, naturally bad!’ And as he shook his head with omen sad, I answered him, in his own cynic strain: ‘Yes, 'tis enough to make a man complain. This world of ours so vicious is and low, It always treats its Benefactors so. If people had their rights, and rights were clear, You would not sit unknown, unhonour'd, here; But all would bow to you, and hold you great, The first and mightiest member of the State. Who is the inmost wheel of the machine? Who keeps the Constitution sharp and clean? Who finishes what statesmen only plan, And keeps the whole game going? You're the Man! At one end of the State the eye may view Her Majesty, and at the other—you; And of the two, both precious, I aver, They seem more ready to dispense with her!’ The Great Man watched me with a solemn look, Then from his lips the pipe he slowly took, And answered gruffly, in a whisper hot: ‘I don't know if you 're making game or not! But, dash my buttons, though you put it strong, It's my opinion you're more right than wrong! There's not another man this side the sea Can settle off the State's account like me. The work from which all other people shrink Comes natural to me as meat and drink,— All neat, all clever, all perform'd so pat, It's quite an honour to be hung like that! People don't howl and bellow when they meet The Sheriff or the Gaoler in the street; They never seem to long in their mad fits To tear the Home Secretary into bits; When Judges in white hats to Epsom Down Drive gay as Tom and Jerry, folk don't frown; They cheer the Queen and Royal Family, But only let them catch a sight of me, And like a pack of hounds they howl and storm! And that's their gratitude; 'cause I perform, In genteel style and in a first-rate way, The work they're making for me night and day! Why, if a mortal had his rights, d' ye see, I should be honour'd as I ought to be— They'd pay me well for doing what I do, And touch their hats whene'er I came in view. Well, after all, they do as they are told; They're less to blame than Government, I hold. Government sees my value, and it knows I keep the whole game going as it goes, And yet it holds me down and makes me cheap, And calls me in at odd times like a sweep To clean a dirty chimney. Let it smoke, And every mortal in the State must choke! And yet, though always ready at the call, I get no gratitude, no thanks at all. Instead of rank, I get a wretched fee, Instead of thanks, a sneer or scowl may-be, Instead of honour such as others win, Why, I must hide away to save my skin. When I am sent for to perform my duty, Instead of coming in due state and beauty, With outriders and dashing grays to draw (Like any other mighty man of law), Disguised, unknown, and with a guilty cheek, The gaol I enter like an area sneak! And when all things have been perform'd with art (With my young man to do the menial part) Again out of the dark, when none can see, I creep unseen to my obscurity!’ His vinous cheek with virtuous wrath was flushed, And to his nose the purple current rushed, While with a hand that shook a little now, He mopp'd the perspiration from his brow, Sighing; and on his features I descried A sparkling tear of sorrow and of pride. Meantime, around him all was mirth and May, The sport was merry and all hearts were gay, The green boughs sparkled back the merriment, The garden honeysuckle scatter'd scent, The warm girls giggled and the lovers squeezed, The matrons drinking tea look'd on full pleased. And far away the church-bells sad and slow Ceased on the scented air. But still the woe Grew on the Great Man's face—the smiling sky, The light, the pleasure, on his fish-like eye Fell colourless;—at last he spoke again, Growing more philosophic in his pain: ‘Two sorts of people fill this mortal sphere, Those who are hung, and those who just get clear; And I'm the schoolmaster (though you may laugh), Teaching good manners to the second half. Without my help to keep the scamps in awe, You'd have no virtue and you'd know no law; And now they only hang for blood alone, Ten times more hard to rule the mob have grown. I've heard of late some foolish folk have plann'd To put an end to hanging in the land; But, Lord! how little do the donkeys know This world of ours, when they talk nonsense so! It's downright blasphemy! You might as well Try to get rid at once of Heaven and Hell! Mankind is bad, sir, naturally bad, Both rich and poor, man, woman, sad, or glad! While some to keep scot-free have got the wit (Not that they're really better—devil a bit!), Others have got my mark so plain and fair In both their eyes, I stop, and gape, and stare. Look at that fellow stretch'd upon the green, Strong as a bull, though only seventeen; Bless you, I know the party every limb, I've hung a few fac-similes of him! And cast your eye on that pale wench who sips Gin in the corner; note her hanging lips, The neat-shaped boots, and the neglected lace: There's baby-murder written on her face!— Tho' accidents may happen now and then, I know my mark on women and on men, And oft I sigh, beholding it so plain, To think what heaps of labour still remain!’ He sigh'd, and yet methought he smackt his lips, As one who in anticipation sips A feast to come. Then I, with a sly thought, Drew forth a picture I had lately bought In Regent Street, and begged the man of fame To give his criticism on the same. First from their case his spectacles he took, Great silver-rimm'd, and with deep searching look The picture's lines in silence pondered he. ‘This is as bad a face as ever I see! This is no common area-sneak or thief, No stealer of a pocket-handkerchief, No! deep's the word, and knowing, and precise, Afraid of nothing, but as cool as ice. Look at his ears, how very low they lie, Lobes far below the level of his eye, And there's a mouth, like any rat-trap's tight, And at the edges bloodless, close, and white. Who is the party? Caught, on any charge? There's mischief near, if he remains at large!’ Gasping with indignation, angry-eyed, ‘Silence! 'tis very blasphemy,’ I cried; ‘Misguided man, whose insight is a sham, These noble features you would brand and damn, This saintly face, so subtle, calm, and high, Are those of one who would not wrong a fly— A friend of man, whom all man's sorrows stir, 'Tis Mr. Mill, the great Philosopher!’ Then for a moment he to whom I spake Seemed staggered, but, with the same ominous shake O' the head, he, rallying, wore a smile half kind, Pitying my simplicity of mind. ‘Sir,’ said he, ‘from my word I will not stir— I've seen that look on many a murderer; But don't mistake—it stands to common sense That education makes the difference! I've heard the party's name, and know that he Is a good pleader for my trade and me; And well he may be! for a clever man Sees pretty well what others seldom can,— That those mark'd qualities which make him great In one way, might by just a turn of fate Have raised him in another! Ah, it's sad— Mankind is bad, sir, naturally bad! It takes a genius in our busy time To plan and carry out a bit of crime That shakes the land and raises up one's hair; Most murder now is but a poor affair— No art, no cunning, just a few blind blows Struck by a bullet-headed rough who knows No better. Clever men now see full plain That crime don't answer. Thanks to me, again! Ah, when I think what would become of men Without my bit of schooling now and then,— To teach the foolish they must mind their play, And keep the clever under every day,— I shiver! As it is, they 're kept by me To decent sorts of daily villany— Law, money-lending, factoring on the land, Share-broking, banking with no cash in hand, And many a sort of weapon they may use Which never brings their neck into the noose; For if they 're talented they can invent Plenty of crime that gets no punishment, Do lawful murder with no sort of fear As coolly as I drink this pot of beer!’ The Great Man paused and drank; his face was grim, Half buried in the pot; and o'er its rim His eye, like the law's bull's-eye, flashing bright To deepen darkness round it, threw its light On the gay scene before him, and it seemed Rendered all wretched near it as it gleamed. A shadow fell upon the merry place, Each figure grew distorted, and each face Spake of crime hidden and of evil thought. Darkling I gazed, sick-hearted and distraught, In silence. Black and decent at my side, With reverend hair, sat melancholy-eyed The Patriarch. To my head I held my hand, And ponder'd, and the look of the fair land Seemed deathlike. On the darkness of my brain The voice, a little thicker, broke again: ‘Ah, things don't thrive as they throve once,’ he said, ‘And I'm alone now my old woman's dead. I find the Sundays dull. First, I attend The morning service, then this way I wend To take my pipe and drop of beer; and then, Home to a lonely meal in town again. 'Tis a dull world!—and grudges me my hire— I ought to get a pension and retire. What living man has served his country so? But who's to take my place I scarcely know! Well, Heaven will punish their neglect anon:— They 'll know my merit, when I'm dead and gone!’ He stood upon his legs, and these, I think, Were rather shaky, part with age, part drink, And with a piteous smile, full of the sense Of human vanity and impotence, Grimly he stood, half senile and half sly, A sight to make the very angels cry; Then lifted up a hat with weepers on— (Worn for some human creature dead and gone) Placing it on his head (unconsciously A little on one side) held out to me His right hand, and, though grim beyond belief, Wore unaware an air of rakish grief— Even so we parted, and with hand-wave proud He faded like a ghost into the crowd. Home to the mighty City wandering, Breathing the freshness of the fields of Spring, Hearing the Lark, and seeing bright winds run Between the bending rye-grass and the sun, I mused and mused; till with a solemn gleam My soul closed, and I saw as in a dream, Apocalyptic, cutting heaven across, Two mighty shapes—a Gallows and a Cross. And these twain, with a sea of lives that clomb Up to their base and struck and fell in foam, Moved, trembled, changed; and lo! the first became A jet-black Shape that bowed its head in shame Before the second, which in turn did change Into a luminous Figure, sweet and strange, Stretching out mighty arms to bless the thing Which hushed its breath beneath Him wondering. And lo! these visions vanished with no word In brightness; and like one that wakes I heard The church bells chime and the cathedrals toll, Filling the mighty City like its Soul. Then, like a spectre strange and woebegone, Uprose again, with mourning weepers on, His hat a little on one side, his breath Heavy and hot, the gray-hair'd Man of Death, Tottering, grog-pimpled, with a trembling pace Under the Gateway of the Silent Place, At whose sad opening the great Puppet stands The rope of which he tugs with palsied hands. Christ help me! whither do my wild thoughts run? And Christ help thee, thou lonely agëd one! Christ help us all, till all 's that dark grows clear— Are those indeed the Sabbath bells I hear? LONDON, 1864. I. Why should the heart seem stiller, As the song grows stronger and surer? Why should the brain grow chiller, And the utterance clearer and purer? To lose what the people are gaining Seems often bitter as gall, Though to sink in the proud attaining Were the bitterest of all. I would to God I were lying Yonder 'mong mountains blue, Chasing the morn with flying Feet in the morning dew! Longing, and aching, and burning To conquer, to sing, and to teach, A passionate face upturning To visions beyond my reach,— But with never a feeling or yearning I could utter in tuneful speech! II. Yea! that were a joy more stable Than all that my soul hath found,— Than to see and to know, and be able To utter the seeing in sound; For Art, the Angel of losses, Comes, with her still, gray eyes, Coldly my forehead crosses, Whispers to make me wise; And, too late, comes the revelation, After the feast and the play, That she works God's dispensation By cruelly taking away: By burning the heart and steeling, Scorching the spirit deep, And changing the flower of feeling, To a poor dried flower that may keep! What wonder if much seems hollow, The passion, the wonder dies; And I hate the angel I follow, And shrink from her passionless eyes,— Who, instead of the rapture of being I held as the poet's dower— Instead of the glory of seeing, The impulse, the splendour, the power— Instead of merrily blowing A trumpet proclaiming the day, Gives, for her sole bestowing, A pipe whereon to play! While the spirit of boyhood hath faded, And never again can be, And the singing seemeth degraded, Since the glory hath gone from me,— Though the glory around me and under, And the earth and the air and the sea, And the manifold music and wonder, Are grand as they used to be! III. Is there a consolation For the joy that comes never again? Is there a reservation? Is there a refuge from pain? Is there a gleam of gladness To still the grief and the stinging? Only the sweet, strange sadness, That is the source of the singing. IV. For the sound of the city is weary, As the people pass to and fro, And the friendless faces are dreary, As they come, and thrill through us, and go; And the ties that bind us the nearest Of our error and weakness are born; And our dear ones ever love dearest Those parts of ourselves that we scorn; And the weariness will not be spoken, And the bitterness dare not be said, The silence of souls is unbroken, And we hide ourselves from our Dead! And what, then, secures us from madness? Dear ones, or fortune, or fame? Only the sweet singing sadness Cometh between us and shame. V. And there dawneth a time to the Poet, When the bitterness passes away, With none but his God to know it, He kneels in the dark to pray; And the prayer is turn'd into singing, And the singing findeth a tongue, And Art, with her cold hands clinging, Comforts the soul she has stung. Then the Poet, holding her to him, Findeth his loss is his gain: The sweet singing sadness thrills through him, Though nought of the glory remain; And the awful sound of the city, And the terrible faces around, Take a truer, tenderer pity, And pass into sweetness and sound; The mystery deepens to thunder, Strange vanishings gleam from the cloud, And the Poet, with pale lips asunder, Stricken, and smitten, and bow'd, Starteth at times from his wonder, And sendeth his Soul up aloud! THE MODERN WARRIOR. O Warrior for the Right, Though thy shirt of mail be white As the snows upon the breast of The Adored, Though the weapon thou mayest claim Hath been temper'd in the flame Of the fire upon the Altar of the Lord, Ere the coming of the night, Thy mail shall be less bright, And the taint of sin may settle on the Sword! For the foemen thou must meet Are the phantoms in the street, And thine armour shall be foul'd in many a place, And the shameful mire and mud, With a grosser stain than blood, Shall be scatter'd 'mid the fray upon thy face; And the helpless thou dost aid Shall shrink from thee dismayed, Till thou comest to the knowledge of things base. Ah, mortal, with a brow Like the gleam of sunrise, thou May'st wander from the pathway in thy turn, In the noontide of thy strength Be stricken down at length, And cry to God for aid, and live, and learn; And when, with many a stain. Thou arisest up again, The lightning of thy look will be less stern. Thou shalt see with humbler eye The adulteress go by, Nor shudder at the touch of her attire; Thou shalt only look with grief On the liar and the thief, Thou shalt meet the very murtherer in the mire— And to which wouldst thou accord, O thou Warrior of the Lord! The vengeance of the Sword and of the Fire? Nay! batter'd in the fray, Thou shalt quake in act to slay, And remember thy transgression and be meek; And the thief shall grasp thy hand, And the liar blushing stand, And the harlot if she list shall kiss thy cheek; And the murtherer, unafraid, Shall meet thee in the shade, And pray thee for the doom thou wilt not wreak. Yet thou shalt help the frail From the phantoms that assail, Yea, the strong man in his anger thou shalt dare; Thy voice shall be a song Against wickedness and wrong, But the wicked and the wronger thou shalt spare. And while thou lead'st the van, The ungrateful hand of man Shall smite thee down and slay thee unaware. With an agonisëd cry Thou shalt shiver down and die, With stainëd shirt of mail and broken brand; And the voice of men shall call, ‘He is fallen like us all, Though the weapon of the Lord was in his hand;’ And thine epitaph shall be, ‘He was wretched ev'n as we;’ And thy tomb may be unhonoured in the land. But the basest of the base Shall bless thy pale dead face And the thief shall steal a bloody lock of hair; And over thee asleep, The adulteress shall weep Such tears as she can never shed elsewhere, Shall bless the broken brand In thy chill and nerveless hand, Shall kiss thy stainëd vesture with a prayer. Then, while in that chill place Stand the basest of the base, Gather'd round thee in the silence of the dark, A white Face shall look down On the silence of the town, And see thee lying dead with those to mark, And a voice shall fill the air, ‘Bear my Warrior lying there To his sleep upon my Breast!’ and they shall heark. Lo, then those fallen things Shall perceive a rush of wings Growing nearer down the azure gulfs untrod, And around them in the night There shall grow a wondrous light, While they hide affrighted faces on the sod, But ere again 'tis dark, They shall raise their eyes, and mark White arms that waft the Warrior up to God! PAN: EPILOGUE. ‘Pan, Pan is dead!’ —E. B. Browning. The broken goblets of the Gods Lie scatter'd in the Waters deep, Where the tall sea-flag blows and nods Over the shipwreck'd seamen's sleep; The gods like phantoms come and go Amid the wave-wash'd ocean-hall, Above their heads the bleak winds blow; They sigh, they shiver to and fro— ‘Pan, Pan!’ those phantoms call. O Pan, great Pan, thou art not dead, Nor dost thou haunt that weedy place, Tho' blowing winds hear not thy tread, And silver runlets miss thy face; Where ripe nuts fall thou hast no state, Where eagles soar, thou now art dumb, By lonely meres thou dost not wait;— But here 'mid living waves of fate We feel thee go and come! O piteous one!—In wintry days Over the City falls the snow, And, where it whitens stony ways, I see a Shade flit to and fro; Over the dull street hangs a cloud— It parts, an ancient Face flits by, 'Tis thine! 'tis thou! Thy gray head bowed, Dimly thou flutterest o'er the crowd, With a thin human cry. Ghost-like, O Pan, thou glimmerest still, A spectral Face with sad dumb stare; On rainy nights thy breath blows chill In the street-walker's dripping hair; Thy ragged woe from street to street Goes mist-like, constant day and night; But often, where the black waves beat, Thou hast a smile most strangely sweet For honest hearts and light! Where'er thy shadowy vestments fly There comes across the waves of strife, Across the souls of all close by, The gleam of some forgotten life: There is a sense of waters clear, An odour faint of flowery nooks; Strange-plumaged birds seem flitting near The cold brain blossoms, lives that hear Ripple like running brooks. And as thou passest, human eyes Look in each other and are wet— Simple or gentle, weak or wise, Alike are full of tender fret; And mean and noble, brave and base Raise common glances to the sky;— And lo! the phantom of thy Face, While sad and low thro' all the place Thrills thy thin human cry! Christ help thee, Pan! canst thou not go Now all the other gods are fled? Why dost thou flutter to and fro When all the sages deem thee dead? Or, if thou still must live and dream, Why leave the fields of harvest fair— Why quit the peace of wood and stream— And haunt the streets with eyes that gleam Through white and holy hair? L'ENVOI TO LONDON POEMS. I do not sing for Maidens. They are roses Blowing along the pathway I pursue: No sweeter things the wondrous world discloses, And they are tender as the morning dew. Blessed be maids and children: day and night Their holy scent is with me as I write. I do not sing for School-boys or Schoolmen. To give them ease I have no languid theme When, weary with the wear of book and pen, They seek their trim poetic Academe; Nor can I sing them amorous ditties, bred Of too much Ovid on an empty head. I do not sing aloud in measured tone Of those fair paths the easy-soul'd pursue; Nor do I sing for Lazarus alone, I sing for Dives and the Devil too. Ah! would the feeble song I sing might swell As high as Heaven, and as deep as Hell! I sing of the stain'd outcast at Love's feet,— Love with his wild eyes on the evening light; I sing of sad lives trampled down like wheat Under the heel of Lust, in Love's despite; I glean behind those wretched shapes ye see In the cold harvest-fields of Infamy. I sing of death-beds (let no man rejoice Till that last piteous touch of all is given!); I sing of Death and Life with equal voice, Heaven watching Hell, and Hell illumed by Heaven. I have gone deep, far down the infernal stair— And seen the spirits congregating there. I sing of Hope, that all the lost may hear; I sing of Light, that all may feel its ray; I sings of Soul, that no one man may fear; I sing of God, that some perchance may pray. Angels in Hosts have praised Him loud and long, But Lucifer's shall be the harvest song. Oh, hush a space the sounds of voices light Mix'd to the music of a lover's lute. Stranger than dream, so luminously bright, The eyes are dazzled and the mouth is mute, Sits Lucifer; singing to sweeten care, He twines immortelles in his hoary hair! Miscellaneous Poems. (1866–70.) THE DEATH OF ROLAND. De Karlemane et de Rolant, Et d'Olivier, et des vassaus, Qui moururent à Rainscevaux! I. Dead was Gerard the fair, the girl-mouth'd, the gay, Who jested with the foe he slung his sword to slay; Dead was the giant Guy, big-hearted, small of brain; Dead was the hunchback Sanche, his red hunch slit in twain; Dead was the old hawk Luz, and sleeping by his side His twin-sons, Charles the fleet, and Pierre the serpent-eyed; Dead was Antoine, the same who swore to speak no word Till five score heathen heads fell by his single sword; Dead was the wise Gerin, who gript both spear and pen; Sansun was dead, Gereir was dead!—dead were the mighty men! II. Then Roland felt his sense return, and stirr'd, and cried, Felt down if Adalmar lay safe against his side, And smiled most quietlie, for joy the Sword was there; With heavy-mailed hand brush'd back his bloody hair, And lying prone upon his back, beheld on high The stars like leopard-spots strewn in the sapphire sky. He turn'd his head, and lo! the large hills looming dim, In the wan west the Moon with red and wasting rim; Then sighing sore, swung round his head as in a swoon, And met the hunchback's eyne, glazèd beneath the Moon. Chill was the air, and frosty vapours to and fro, Like sheeted shapes, in dim moonshine, were stealing slow; And Roland thought, because his wound had made him weak, The cold shapes breathed alive their breath upon his cheek. Crawling unto his knees, shivering in the cold, He loosed his helm, and dimly gleaming down it roll'd; And darkly his dim eyes distinguish'd things around,— The mute and moveless shapes asleep upon the ground, A helm glittering dim, a sword-hilt twinkling red, A white steed quivering beside a warrior dead, And in one moonlit place, a ring on a white hand, When Roland thought, ‘Gerard! the brightest of the band!’ And no one stirr'd; behind, the hills loom'd large and dim; And in the west the waning Moon with red and wasting rim. III. Then Roland cried aloud, ‘If living man there be Among these heaps of slain, let that man answer me!’ And no soul spake. The wind crept chilly over all, And no man felt it creep, or heard the leader call. ‘Ho, Olivier! Gerin! speak, an' ye be not slain!’ The voices of the hills echoed the cry again,— Only a heathen churl rose cursing on his side, And spat at him who spake, and curl'd his limbs, and died. Then Roland's mighty heart was heavy with its woes,— When fitfully, across the fields, faint radiance rose, First a faint spark, and then a gleam, and then a glare, Then smoke and crimson streaks that mingled in the air, And as the thick flame clear'd, and the black smoke swam higher, There loom'd beyond a Shape like one girt round with fire! And Roland cried aloud, because his joy was great, And brandish'd Adalmar, and fell beneath the weight, But lying prone strain'd eyes, and, gazing through the night, Still saw the glittering Shape circled with spectral light. He seem'd in a dark dream, he could not think at all, Until his heart rose up, and he had strength to crawl: Then, like a bruisèd worm weary he slipt and slow, Straining his fever'd eyes lest the sweet ghost should go, And oft he paused to breathe, feeling his pulses fail, 'Mong heathens foul to smell and warriors clad in mail, But coming near the gleam beheld the godly man, Turpin the Archbishòp, unhelm'd and gaunt and wan,— Gripping with skinny hand the ivory Cross sat he, Clad head to heel in frost-white mail and propt against a tree. IV. And when on hands and knees the stricken Chief came near, The Bishop raised the Cross, and knew his comrade dear; And Roland's heart swell'd up, and tears were on his cheek, He touch'd the blessèd Cross, and smiled and did not speak; While, ‘Glory be to God!’ the Bishop faintly said, ‘Thou livest, kinsman dear, though all the rest be dead! For while I linger'd here and listen'd for a sound, And in the dim red Moon beheld the dead around, Thinking I heard a cry, I sought to cry again, But all my force had fled, and I was spent with pain; When, peering round, I saw this heathen at my heel, And search'd his leathern scrip and gat me flint and steel, Then crawl'd, though swooning-sick, and found his charger gray, And searching in the bags found wither'd grass and hay, And made a fire, a sign for thee, whoe'er thou wert, But fainted when it blazed, for I am sorely hurt; And waken'd to behold thee near, wounded and weak, The red fire flaming on thy face, thy breath upon my cheek.’ V. Then those brave (hiefs wrung hands, and as the crimson flare Died out, and all was dark, the Bishop said a prayer; And shadows loom'd out black against the frosty shine, While Turpin search'd his pouch and murmur'd, ‘Here is wine!’ And Roland on his elbows raised himself and quaff'd, Yea, till his head reel'd round, a great and goodly draught, And quickly he felt strong, his heart was wild and light, He placed his dear Sword softly down, and rose his height, Loosening his mail, drew forth the shirt that lay beneath, And took the blood-stain'd silk and tore it with his teeth, Dressing the Bishop's wounds with chilly hand and slow, Then, while the Bishop pray'd, bound up his own wide wound alsoe. VI. Then Roland search'd around, dipping his hands in blood, Till in a henchman's pack he found a torch of wood, And taking flint and steel, blew with his mouth, and lo! The torch blazed bright, and all grew crimson in the glow. Then into Turpin's hands he set that beacon bright Who glittering like fire, sat looming in its light, And crept across the mead, into the dark again, And felt the faces of the dead, seeking the mighty men. VII. Blest be thy name, White Mary, for thy breath and might, Like vapour cold, did fill the nostrils of thy knight! Yea, all his force came back, his red wound ceased to bleed, And he had hands of strength to do a blessèd deed! For one by one he found each well-belovèd head, Sought out the mighty Chiefs, among the drifts of dead, Softly unloosed their helms, let the long tresses flow, Trail'd them to Turpin's feet and set them in a row; And underneath the tree the pine-torch blazing bright Lit shapes in silvern mail and faces snowy white: Sansun, who grasp'd his sword with grip that ne'er unloosed; Gerin, with chin on breast, as if he breathed and mused; Great Guy, with twisted limbs, and bosom gash'd and bare, And blood-clots on his arms the frost had frozen there; Old Luz, his skinny hands filled with a foeman's beard; Charles with his feet lopp'd off, Pierre with his green eye spear'd; Sanche, the fierce woman's foe, and round his neck, behold! A lock of lady's hair set in a ring of gold; Antoine, with crafty smile, as if new fights he plann'd; Gerard, still smiling on the ring that deckt his hand; And, brightest of the host, our Roland's comrade dear, The iron woman-shape, the long-lock'd Olivier, Who gript the bladeless hilt of Durandal his pride, And held it to his kissing lips, as when he droop'd and died. VIII. And Turpin raised the torch, counted them, one by one: ‘Ah, woe is me, sweet knights, for now your work is done!’ Then, reaching with the Cross, he touch'd their brows and cried: ‘White Mary take your souls, and place them at her side, White Mary take your souls, and guard them tenderlie,— For ye were goodly men as any men that be!’ And Roland stooping touch'd the brow of Olivier, Smoothing the silken hair behind the small white ear, And cried, ‘Ah, woe is me, that we should ever part!’ And kiss'd him on the clay-cold lips, and swoon'd, for ache of heart. IX. Then Turpin dropt the torch, that flamed upon the ground, But drinking blood and dew, died out with drizzlie sound; He groped for Roland's heart, and felt it faintly beat, And, feeling on the earth, he found the wine-flask sweet, And fainting with the toil, slaked not his own great drouth, But, shivering, held the flask to Roland's gentle mouth: E'en then, his Soul shot up, and in its shirt of steel The Corse sank back, with crash like ice that cracks beneath the heel! X. The frosty wind awaken'd Roland from his swound, And, spitting salt foam from his tongue, he look'd around, And saw the Bishop dear lying at length close by,— Touch'd him, and found him cold, and utter'd a great cry: ‘Now, dead and cold, alas! lieth the noblest wight For preaching sermons sweet and wielding sword in fight; His voice was as a trump that on a mountain blows, He scatter'd oils of grace and wasted heathen-foes,— White Mary take his soul, to join our comrades dear, And let him wear his Bishop's crown in heaven above, as here!’ XI. Now it grew chiller far, the grass was moist with dew, The landskip glimmer'd pale, the frosty breezes blew, The many stars above melted like snowflakes white, Behind the great blue hills the East was laced with light, The dismal vale loom'd clear against a crimson glow, Clouds spread above like wool, pale steam arose below, And on the faces dead the frosty Morning came, On mighty men of mark and squires unknown to fame, And golden mail gleam'd bright, and broken steel gleam'd gray, And cold dew filled the wounds of those who sleeping lay; And Roland, rising, drank the dawn with lips apart, But scents were in the air that sicken'd his proud heart! Yea, all was deathly still; and now, though it was day, The Moon grew small and pale, but did not pass away, The white mist wreath'd and curl'd over the glittering dead; A cock crew, far among the hills, and echoes answerèd. XII. Then peering to the East, through the thick vaporous steam, He spied a naked wood, hard by a running stream; Thirsting full sore, he rose, and thither did he hie, Faintly, and panting hard, because his end was nigh; But first he stooping loosed from Turpin's fingers cold The Cross inlaid with gems and wrought about with gold, And bare the holy Cross aloft in one weak hand, And with the other trail'd great Adalmar his brand. Thus wearily he came into the woody place, And stooping to the stream therein did dip his face, And in the pleasant cold let swim his great black curls, Then swung his head up, damp with the dim dewy pearls; And while the black blood spouted in a burning jet, He loosed the bandage of his wound and made it wet, Wringing the silken folds, making them free from gore, Then placed them cool upon the wound, and tighten'd them once more. XIII. Eastward rose cloudy mist, drifting like smoke in air, Ghastly and round the Sun loom'd with a lurid glare, High overhead the Moon shrivell'd with sickle chill, The frosty wind dropp'd down, and all was deathlier still, When Roland, drawing deep the breath of vapours cold Beheld three marble steps, as of a Ruin old, And at the great tree-bolls lay many a carven stone, Thereto a Dial quaint, where slimy grass had grown; And frosted were the boughs that gather'd all around, And cold the runlet crept, with soft and soothing sound, And sweetly Roland smiled, thinking, ‘Since death is nigh, In sooth, I know no gentler place where gentle man could die!’ XIV. Whereon he heard a cry, a cry, a crash of breaking boughs, And from the thicket wild leapt one with painted brows; Half-naked, glistening grim, with oily limbs, he came, His long-nail'd fingers curl'd, his bloodshot eyes aflame, Shrieking in his own tongue, as on the Chief he flew, ‘Yield thee thy sword of fame, and thine own flesh thereto!’ Then Roland gazed and frown'd, though nigh unto his death, Sat still, and drew up all his strength in one great breath, Pray'd swiftly to the Saints he served in former days, With right hand clutch'd the Sword he was too weak to raise, And in the left swung up the Cross!—and, shrieking hoarse, Between the eyebrows smote the foe with all his force, Yea, smote him to the brain, crashing through skin and bone, And prone the heathen fell, as heavy as a stone,— While gold and gems of price, unloosen'd by the blow, Ev'n as he fell rain'd round the ringlets of the foe; But Roland kiss'd the Cross, and, laughing, backward fell, And on the hollow air the laugh rang heavy, like a knell. XV. And Roland thought: ‘I surely die; but, ere I end, Let me be sure that thou art ended too, O friend! For should a heathen hand grasp thee when I am clay, My ghost would grieve full sore until the Judgment Day!’ Then to the marble steps, under the tall bare trees, Trailing the mighty Sword, he crawl'd on hands and knees, And on the slimy stone he struck the blade with might— The bright hilt sounding shook, the blade flash'd sparks of light; Wildly again he struck, and his sick head went round, Again there sparkled fire, again rang hollow sound; Ten times he struck, and threw strange echoes down the glade, Yet still unbroken, sparkling fire, glitter'd the peerless blade! XVI. Then Roland wept, and set his face against the stone— ‘Ah, woe! I shall not rest, though cold be flesh and bone!’ And sickness seized his soul to die so cheerless death; When on his naked neck he felt a touch, like breath,— And did not stir, but thought, ‘O God, that madest me, And shall my sword of fame brandish'd by heathens be? And shall I die accursed, beneath a heathen's heel? Too spent to slay the slave whose hated breath I feel!’ Then, clenching teeth, he turn'd to look upon the foe, His bright eyes growing dim with coming death; and lo! His life shot up in fire, his heart arose again, For no unhallow'd face loom'd on his dying ken, No heathen-breath he felt, — though he beheld, indeed, The white arch'd head and round brown eyes of Veillintif, his Steed! XVII. And pressing his moist cheek on his who gazed beneath, Curling the upper lip to show the large white teeth, The white horse, quivering, look'd with luminous liquid eye, Then waved his streaming mane, and utter'd up a cry; And Roland's bitterness was spent—he laugh'd, he smiled, He clasp'd his darling's neck, wept like a little child; He kiss'd the foam-fleck'd lips, and clasp'd his friend and cried: ‘Ah, nevermore, and nevermore, shall we to battle ride! Ah, nevermore, and nevermore, shall we sweet comrades be, And Veillintif, had I the heart to die forgetting thee? To leave thy brave bright heart to break, in slavery to the foe? I had not rested in the grave, if it had ended so! Ah, never shall we conquering ride, with banners bright unfurl'd, A shining light 'mong lesser lights, a wonder to the world!’ XVIII. And Veillintif neigh'd low, breathing on him who died, Wild rock'd his strong sad heart beneath his silken side, Tears roll'd from his brown eyes upon his master's cheek, While Roland, gathering strength, though wholly worn and weak, Held up the glittering point of Adalmar the brand, And at his comrade's heart drave with his dying hand; And the black blood sprang forth, while heavily as lead, With shivering, silken side, the mighty Steed fell dead. Then Roland, for his eyes with frosty film were dim, Groped for his friend, crept close, and smiled, embracing him; And, pillow'd on his neck, kissing the pure white hair, Clasp'd Adalmar the brand, and tried to say a prayer: And that he conquering died wishing all men to know, Set firm his lips, and turn'd his face towards the foe, Then closed his eyes, and slept, and never woke again. Roland is dead, the gentle knight! dead is the crown of men! THE GIFT OF EOS. Not in a mist of loveless eyes dies he, Who loveth truly nobler light than theirs; To him, nor weariness nor agony, Purblind appeals, nor prayers; To him, the priceless boon To watch from heights divine till all be done; Calm in each dreamy rising of the Moon, Glad in each glorious coming of the Sun. CHORUS OF HOURS. 1 Lo! here at the portal, awaiting new light, We linger with pinions dripping dew-light, Our faces shadow'd, our heads inclining, The bright star-frost on our tresses shining; Our eyes turn'd earthward in vigil holy, Sinking our voices and singing slowly. 2 The dark Earth sleepeth to our intoning, The Ocean only is gleaming and moaning; Our eyelids droop in a still devotion, Yet we see the skies in the glass of Ocean,— The void, star-lighted, is mirror'd faintly, Slow slides the shade of Selene saintly. 3 Eos! Eos! thou canst not hear us, Yet we feel thee breathing in slumber near us: Dark is thy cloud-roof'd temple solemn, Shadows deepen round arch and column; But a quiet light streams round thee, lying In the feeble arms of thy love undying. 4 Eos! Eos! thy cheek faint-gleaming Sendeth a joy through the old man's dreaming; His white hair poureth in frosty showers Round a wreath fresh-woven of lily flowers, And the flowers are fading and earthward snowing, Save those thou breathest against unknowing! TITHONOS. What low, strange music throbs about my brain? I hear a motion as of robes—a moaning. EOS. 'Tis the three sisters and their shadowy train, Beating the right foot solemnly, and intoning. Ah! weary one, and have thy dreams been ill, That thou upheavest thus a face so pale? TITHONOS. Methought that I was dead, and cold, and still, Deep in the navel of a charmëd dale! Ah, love, thy gift doth heavy burthen bring, Now I grow old, grow old, And these weird songs the sisters nightly sing Haunt me with memories strange and manifold; For every eve, when Phoibos fades away Yonder across Parnassos' snow-tipt height, These halls feel empty, and the courts grow gray, The sisters lose the radiance of the day, And thy bright hair fades to a silvern light; And nothing seems that is not sad though sweet! But Heaven, this East, yea, and the earth below Are silenced to the ditties these repeat, Sinking their voices sad and singing slow: Yea, Ocean moans with many waters! sleep Is troublous even upon eyes that weep! The monsters of the earth are in their lairs Moonlit and cold; the owl sits still and stares Through woody nooks with round white eye; the wind Breatheth and gropeth blind; The burthen and the mystery and the dream, The sense of things that are and yet may be. The strife between what is and what doth seem, Is weary then on all, and most on me! EOS. It is enough to know thou canst not die, Like those of whom thou 'plainest, drowsy one! TITHONOS. The seasons come and go, the moments fly Like snow-flakes falling, melting in the sun. Nothing abideth—all must change the earth Puts on fresh raiment every dawn of day— What seems most precious turns to little worth— Our love, whose face was an auroral birth, Steps in the shade an instant,—and is clay. Is it enough to know I cannot die? Further than deathless life, can I implore? Ah, but to know, as the slow years sweep by, That life is worthy to be lived, is more. Wherefore the burthen and the dream below? Wherefore the happiness, the hope, the woe? Wherefore the slimy sense of evil things That draws the adder round the young man's eyes? Wherefore the yearnings and imaginings, The songs of bards, the broodings of the wise? Have the gods written only on their scroll: ‘Man striveth merely for a little space,— Then there is slumber, and the death-bells toll, The children cry, the widow hides her face, The foolish dream is o'er, And all is done for ever evermore?’ Oh, wherefore life at all, if life be such,— A joy, a weariness, a growing gray! If life be more, how may man live too much? EOS. Nothing, be sure, can wholly pass away. HOURS. Crow's-nest on a yew-tree, swing slow in sad weather, A lock o' wet hair pastes thy brown sides together!— Blood-red were her lips till she paled and grew thin, As the pink under-eyelid of snakes was her skin. Crow's-nest on a yew-tree that grows on a tomb, The little black fledglings croak low in the gloom; O maiden below, canst thou hear how they cry? Dost thou stir in thy sleep as the adder goes by? A worm crawl'd away with the little gold ring He placed on thy finger that summer morning; Then thy hand became bone, then was turn'd into clay, While thy heart wither'd slowly; but cheerly, to-day Thy fingers are leaves on the tree, in whose shade He sits with as tender a maid! TITHONOS. Of death, corruption, change, and mystery, They chant their chime to which the old world sleeps! Why not for ever stand they bright and free, Flinging a glad song over dales and deeps, As morn by morn they do, when from my breast With rosy footsteps thou dost bright'ning go, Blue-wingëd, to Parnassos? EOS. Be at rest! The sense of things is dark on these also! And e'en immortal gods grow pale at times To hear their world-old rhymes. Yea, Zeus the Sire himself beholds and hears, Stares vacantly into the blue profound, What time a rainbow drawn from all earth's tears Fades on Olumpos with a weeping sound! TITHONOS. What then remains, my soul, if this be so? EOS. Around my neck I wind thy beard of gray, And kiss thy quivering eyelids till they glow, And thy face lightens on me, and I say, ‘Look in mine eyes and know!’ HOURS. O clod of green mould, that wast lately a man, Time was thou wert footsore and weary and wan, When thy brain was as fire, when thine eyes were as lead, When thy hair was as white as the bones of the dead! Dust in the urn, on a shelf, in a shrine, Hast thou ears, hast thou eyes, canst thou feel, or divine? Bones in the ground, can ye guess what ye be? Brain, in the midst of the bones, canst thou see? Corse, in a clod-gown clammy with dew, Skull, with a hole where the arrow went through, Do ye dream, are ye troubled, remember ye there The life and the light that ye were? TITHONOS. Thine eyes are lit with passion strong enew To melt a mortal's heart to fiery dew! The burthen and the wonder and the dream, Yea, all I am or was, and all I seem, Are dwarf'd within these liquid orbs of thine To the blue shadow of a love divine! Yea, sweetest, love is surest, truest, best! And dearest, knowing it must last for long! EOS. Now, close thine eyes, lean heavy on my breast, And let my lips rain over thee in song!— Thou wert a mortal who with fearless eyes Dared seek the love of an immortal thing; Plead low thou didst, and strive and agonise, Yet time ebb'd on, and little peace did bring; And the immortal joy seem'd far away, Lessening and lessening to a speck of gold Against the gates of sunrise,—till that day I came upon thee where thou sleeping lay, Breathed smoothness on thy wrinkled forehead old, And woke thee to these wondrous halls, from whence Thou seest the glimmering tract of earth below, And trancëd thee to nuptials so intense Thy flesh and blood seem'd melting off like snow, Leaving thy soul in its eternal hues Clear, strong, and pale, as yonder crystal sphere That swings above my threshold, sprinkling dews Immortal over all who enter here!— And still thy corporal semblance ages on, Thy hair dries up, thy bones grow chill and bare. A little while, my love, and all is gone, Drunk by the lips of a diviner air! TITHONOS. Ah woe! ah woe!—and I am lost for aye! EOS. Nothing, be sure, can wholly pass away! And nothing suffers loss if love remains! The motion of mine air consumes thy clay, My breath dries up the moisture of thy veins; Yet have I given thee immortal being, Thereto immortal love, immortal power, Consuming thy base substance till thy seeing Grows clearer, brighter, purer, hour by hour;— Immortal honour, too, is thine, for thou Hast sought the highest meed the gods can give— Immortal Love hath stoop'd to kiss thy brow! Immortal Love hath smiled, and bade thee live! Wherefore the gods have given thee mighty meed, And snatch'd thee from the death-pyres of thy race, To wear away these weary mortal weeds In a serener and a purer place,— Not amid warriors on a battle plain, Not by the breath of pestilence or woe, But here, at the far edge of earth and main, Whence light and love and resurrection flow— And I upon thy breast, to soothe the pain! Immortal life assured, what mattereth That it be not the old fond life of breath! Immortal life assured, the soul is free— It is enough to be! For lo! the love, the dream, to which is given Divine assurance by a mortal peace, Mix with the wonders of supremest heaven, Become a part of that which cannot cease, And being eternal must be beauteous too, And being beauteous, surely must be glad! O love, my love, thy wildest dreams were true, Though thou were footsore in thy quest, and sad! Not in a mist of hungry eyes dies he Who loveth purely nobler light than theirs; For him nor weariness nor agony, Purblind appeals, nor prayers; But circled by the peace serene and holy Of that divinest thought he loved so long, Pensive, not melancholy, He mingles with those airs that made him strong,— A little loath to quit The old familiar dwelling-house of clay, Yet calm, as the warm wind dissolveth it, And leaf by leaf it droppeth quite away. To him the priceless boon To watch from heights serene till all be done; Calm in each dreamy rising of the Moon, Glad in each glorious coming of the Sun! HOURS. The stars are fading away in wonder, Small sounds are stirring around and under, Far away, from beneath the ocean, We hear a murmur of wheels in motion, And the wind that brings it along rejoices,— Our hearts beat quicker, we lift our voices! EOS. It is Apollo! Hitherward he urges His four steeds, steaming odorous fumes of day; Along his chariot-wheels the white sea surges, As up he drives his fiery-footed way. TITHONOS. Ye brighten, O ye columns round about! Ye melt in purple shades, arches and towers! Cloud-roof, thou partest, and white hands slip out, Scattering pearls and flowers! Brighter and brighter, blazing red and gold, Purple and amethyst, that float and fly!— While, creeping in, a dawn-wind fresh and cold Pours silver o'er the couch whereon I lie! Afar the coming of Apollo grows! His breath lifts up my hair! my pulses beat! My beard is moist with dews divinely sweet, My lap is fill'd with sparkling leaves of rose, Wherein my fingers, witherëd and sere, Grope palsiedly in joy!—Afar I hear The low, quick breathing that the earth is making— Eastward she turns her dewy side, awaking. But thou! but thou! Insufferably brightening! Thy feet yet bathed in moist still shade, thy brow Glistening and lightening, Thy luminous eyes enlarging, ring in ring Of liquid azure, and thy golden hair Unfolding downward, curl on curl, to cling Around thy naked feet rose-tipt and bare! Thy hands stretch'd out to catch the flowers down-flowing, Thy blushing look on mine, thy light green vest In balmy airs of morning backward blowing From one divine white breast! The last star melts above thee in the blue, The cold moon shrinks her horn, as thou dost go Parnassos-ward, flower-laden, dripping dew, Heralding him who cometh from below! HOURS. 1 Our hearts beat quicker, we lift our voices, The east grows golden, the earth rejoices, White clouds part with a radiant motion, Moist sails glimmer beneath on Ocean, And downward tripping, the sweet Immortal Blushingly pauses without the portal! 2 Eos! Eos! the sound from under Deepens in music and might and wonder: Thou standest now on Parnassos' mountain, Thy feet drip pearls from the sacred fountain, And the Sisters nine, to thy bright skirt clinging, Greet thee with smiling and mystic singing! 3 Eos! Eos! all earth beholds thee, The light of the sunrise there infolds thee, A cry comes up from the earth below thee, Mountains and forests and waters know thee, Fresh airs thy robe are backward blowing, Under thy footprints flowers are growing! 4 Eos! Eos! the sound is louder! Behinds reams radiance fiercer and prouder! A moment thou blushest, and glad we view thee, Then Apollo the Fire-God speeds unto thee, Speeding by with a smile he hails thee,— And the golden cloud of his breathing veils thee! CLARI IN THE WELL. O my fountain of a maiden, Sweet to hear and bright to see, Now before mine eyes love-laden Dancing, thrilling, flashing free,— Still thy sparkling bliss a moment, sit thee down, and look at me. Gaze into my face, my dearest! Through thy gleaming, golden hair; Meet mine eyes—ah! thine are clearest When my image floateth there; Now, they still themselves, like waters when the windless skies are fair. In those depths of limpid azure See my baby likeness beam! Deep blue with reflected pleasure From some heavenly dome of dream, Crystal currents of thy spirit swim around it, glance, and gleam! Hold my hand, and heark'ning to me For a space, be calm and cold. While that liquid look flows through me And I love thee twenty-fold, I am smiling at a story thy dead mother often told. When thou wast a little blossom Blown about thy village home, Thou didst on that mother's bosom Put a question troublesome: ‘Mother, please, where did you find me? whence do little children come?’ And the dame with bright beguiling Kiss'd her answer first, my dear! But, still prest, she answer'd smiling— ‘In the orchard Well so clear, Thou wert seen one sunny morning, sleeping, and we brought thee here.’ With a look as grave as this is Thou didst ponder thoughts profound; On the next day with fond kisses Clinging mother's neck around— ‘Mother! mother! I've been looking in the Well where I was found! ‘Bright and clear it is! but—mother!’ (Here thine eyes look'd wonderingly) ‘In the well there is another— Just the very same as me!— And it is awake and moving—and its pretty eyes can see! ‘When I stretch my arms unto it, Out its little arms stretch too! Apple-blossoms red I threw it, And it broke away from view— Then again it look'd up laughing through the waters deep and blue!’ Then thy gentle mother kiss'd thee, Clari, as I kiss thee now, With a wondering fondness bless'd thee, Smooth'd the bright hair from thy brow— Saying, ‘'Tis a little Sister, happy-eyed and sweet as thou! ‘Underneath the deep pure water Dwell its parents in green bowers— Yes, it is their little daughter, Just the same as thou art ours; And it loves to lie there, looking at the pleasant orchard flowers. ‘Every day, while thou art growing, Thou wilt find thy Sister fair— Even when the skies are snowing And the water freezes there, Break the blue ice,—through the water with a cold cheek she will stare! ‘As thou changest, growing taller, She will change, through all the years— Well thou may'st thy Sister call her, She will share thy hopes and fears, She will wear the face thou wearest, sweet in smiles and sad in tears. ‘Ah, my darling! may'st thou ever See her look as kind and bright, Find her woeful-featured never In the pleasant orchard light— May you both be glad and happy, when your golden locks are white!’ Golden locks!—what, these grow hoary? Wrinkles mar a face like this? Break the charm of the old story With the magic of a kiss— Here thou art, my deep-eyed darling, as thou wast,—a thing of bliss. Does she love thee? does she miss thee? Thy sweet Sister in the well? Does she mourn because I kiss thee— Fearing what she cannot tell?— For you both are link'd together by a truth and by a spell. Darling, be my love and duty Judged by her! and prove me so; When upon her mystic beauty Thou perceivest shame or woe; When she changes into sadness, may God judge, and strike me low! Thou and thy sweet Sister move in A diviner element, Clear as light, more sweet to love in Than my world so turbulent; Holy waters bathe and bless you, peaceful, bright, and innocent. And within those eyes of azure See! my baby image beam, Deep blue with reflected pleasure From some heavenly dome of dream, Crystal currents of thy spirit swim around it, glance, and gleam. O my fountain of a maiden, Be thy days for ever blest, Dancing in mine eyes love-laden, Lying smiling on my breast,— Brighter than a fount, in motion, deeper than a well, at rest. SERENADES. I. Sleep on thine eyes, peace in thy breast, White-limb'd lady, be at rest! Near the room wherein you lie, Broods the owl with luminous eye. Midnight comes; all fair things sleep, While all dark things vigil keep; Round thy bed thy scented bower Foldeth like a lily-flower. All so still around thee lies, Peace in thy breast, sleep on thine eyes! All without is dark as death, But thy lover wakeneth. Underneath thy bower I pace, Star-dew sparkling on my face; All around me, swift of flight, Move the creatures of the night. Hark, the great owl cries again With an echo in the brain; And the dark earth in her sleep Stirs and trembles, breathing deep. Sleep on thine eyes, peace in thy breast! Fold thy hands and take thy rest; All the night, till morning break, Spirits walk and lovers wake! II. Sleep sweet, belovëd one, sleep sweet! Without here night is growing, The dead leaf falls, the dark boughs meet, And a chill wind is blowing. Strange shapes are stirring in the night, To the deep breezes wailing, And slow, with wistful gleams of light, The storm-tost moon is sailing. Sleep sweet, belovëd one, sleep sweet! Fold thy white hands, my blossom! Thy warm limbs in thy lily sheet, Thy hands upon thy bosom. Though evil thoughts may walk the dark, Not one shall near thy chamber; But shapes divine shall pause to mark, Singing to lutes of amber. Sleep sweet, belovëd one, sleep sweet! Though, on thy bosom creeping, Strange hands are laid, to feel the beat Of thy soft heart in sleeping. The brother angels, Sleep and Death, Stoop by thy couch and eye thee; And Sleep stoops down to drink thy breath, While Death goes softly by thee! IN THE GARDEN. HE. Seest thou two waifs of cloud on the dim blue Wandering in the melancholy light? Methinks they seem like spirits bright and true, Blending their gentle breaths, and born anew, In the still rapture of this heavenly night! See! how the flowering stars their path bestrew, Till the moon turns, and smiles, and looks them through, And breathes upon them, when with bosoms white They blend on one another, and unite. Now they are gone, they vanish from our view, Lost in that radiance exquisitely bright! . . . O love! my love! methinks that thou and I Resemble those thin waifs in Heaven astray; We meet, we blend, grow bright! SHE. And we must die! HE. Nay, sweet, for Love can never pass away! SHE. Are they not gone? and, dear, shall we not go? O Love is Life, but after Life comes Death! HE. No flower, no drop of rain, no flake of snow, No beauteous thing that blossometh below, May perish, though it vanish ev'n as breath! The bright moon drinks those wanderers of the west, They melt in her warm breathing, and are blest. We see them not, but in that light divine Upgather'd, they are happy, and they shine: Not lost, but vanish'd, grown ev'n unawares A part of a diviner light than theirs! NIGHTINGALES SING. Through our throats the raptures rise, In the scented air they swim; From the skies, With their own love-lustre dim, Gaze innumerable eyes!— Sweet, O sweet, Thrills the music from each throat, Thick and fleet, Note on note, Till in ecstasy we float! SHE. How vast looks Heaven! how solitary and deep! Dost thou believe that Spirits walk the air, Treading those azure fields, and downward peep With great sad eyes when Earth is fast asleep? HE. One spirit, at least, immortal Love, is there! A SHOOTING STAR. Swift from my bliss, in the silence above, I slip to thy kiss, O my star! O my love! SPIRITS IN THE LEAVES. Who are these twain in the garden-bowers? They glide with a rapture rich as ours. Touch them, feel them, and drink their sighs, Brush their lips and their cheeks and eyes! How their hearts beat! how they glow! Brightly, lightly, they come and go; Upward gazing they look in bliss, Save when softly they pause, to kiss. Kiss them also, and share the light That fills their breathing this golden night. Touch them! clasp them! round them twine, Their lips are burning with breath divine. HE. Love, tread this way with rosy feet; And resting on the shadowy seat 'Neath the laburnum's golden rain, Watch how with murmurous refrain The fountain leaps, its basin dark Flashing with many a starry spark. With such a bliss, with such a light, With such an iteration bright, Our souls upbubbling from the clay, Leap, sparkle, blend in silvern spray, Gleam in the Moon, and, falling still, Sink duskily with tremulous thrill, Together blent with kiss and press, In dark surcease of happiness. Yet there they pause not, but, cast free After deep pause of ecstasy, Heavenward they leap, together clinging, And like the fountain flash, upspringing! THE FOUNTAIN LEAPING. Higher, still higher! With a trembling and gleaming Still upward streaming, In the sparkling fire Of a dim desire; Still higher, higher, With a bright pulsation Of aspiration,— Higher! Higher, still higher! To the lights above me; They gleam, they love me, They beckon me nigher, And my waves aspire, Still higher, higher;— But I fall down failing, Still wildly wailing— Higher! NIGHTINGALES SING. Deeper now our raptures grow; Softlier let our voices croon! Yet more slow, Let our happy music flow, Sweet and slow, hush'd and low, Now the dark cloud veils the Moon. Sweet, O sweet! Watch her as our wild hearts beat! . . See! she quits the clasping cloud, Forth she sails on shining feet, Smiling, with her bright head bow'd! Pour the living rapture loud! Thick and fleet, Sweet, O sweet, Now the notes of rapture crowd! SHE (to herself). And this is Love!—Until this hour I never lived; but like a flower Close prest i' the bud, with sleeping senses I drank the dark dim influences Of sunlight, moonlight, shade, and dew. At last I open, thrilling thro' With Love's strange scent, which seemeth part Of the warm life within my heart, Part of the air I breathe . . . O bliss! Was ever night so sweet as this? It is enough to breathe, to be, As if one were a flower, a tree, A leaf o' the bough, just stirring light With the warm breathing of the night! SPIRITS IN THE LEAVES. Whisper! what are they doing now? He is kissing her white, white brow, Turning it softly to the light, Like a beautiful tablet marble white. The Moon is shining upon it—lo! Whiter it is than driven snow. He kisseth again and speaketh gay; Whisper, whisper! what doth he say? HE. For ever and ever! for ever and ever! As the fount that upleaps, as the breezes that blow, Love thou me! For ever and ever, for ever and ever, While the nightingales sing and the rose garlands glow, Love I thee! For ever and ever, with all things to prove us, In this world, in that world that bendeth above us, Asleeping, awaking, in earth, as in Heaven, By this kiss, this other, by thousands ungiven, By the hands which now touch thee, the arms that enfold thee, By the soul in my eyes that now swoons to behold thee, By starlight, by moonlight, by scented rose-blossoms, By all things partaking the joy of our bosoms, By the rapture within us, the rapture around us, By God who has made us and Love who hath crown'd us, One sense and one soul we are blent, ne'er to sever. For ever and ever! for ever and ever! More kisses to seal it ???? For ever and ever! THE WOOD ECHOES. For ever and ever! THE ASRAI. (PROLOGUE TO THE CHANGELING.) 'Tis midnight, and the light upon my desk Burns dim and blue, and flickers as I read The gold-clasp'd tome, whose stainëd yellow leaves Feel spongy to the touch yet rough with dust, When Clari, from her chamber overhead, Her bright hair flowing brighter from the brush, Steals in, and peeps, and sits upon my knee, And winds her gentle arms around my neck, Then sidelong peeping, on the page antique Rains her warm looks, and kisses as I read. ‘Before man grew of the four elements, The Asrai grew of three—fire, water, air— Not earth,—they were not earthly. That was ere The opening of the golden eye of day: The world was silvern,—moonlight mystical Flooded her silent continents and seas,— And in green places the pale Asrai walked To deep and melancholy melody, Musing, and cast no shades. ‘These could not die As men die; Death came later; pale yet fair, Pensive yet happy, in the lonely light The Asrai wander'd, choosing for their homes All gentle places—valleys mossy deep, Star-haunted waters, yellow strips of sand Kissing the sad edge of the shimmering sea, And porphyry caverns in the gaunt hillsides, Frosted with gems and dripping diamond dews In mossy basins where the water black Bubbled with wondrous breath. The world was pale, And these were things of pallor; flowers and scents, All shining things, came later; later still, Ambition, with thin hand upon his heart, Crept out of night and hung the heights of heaven With lights miraculous; later still, man dug Out of the caves the thick and golden glue That knits together the stone ribs of earth; Nor flowers, nor scents, the pallid Asrai knew, Nor burning aspiration heavenward, Nor blind dejection downward under earth After the things that glitter. Their desires Shone stationary—gentle love they felt For one another—in their sunless world Silent they walked and mused, knowing no guile, With lives that flow'd within as quietly As rain-drops dripping with bright measured beat From mossy cavern-eaves.’ O Love! My love! How thy heart beats! how the fond kisses rain! We cannot love like those—ours is a pain, A tumult, a delirium, a dream. O little one of four sweet elements, Fire on thy face, and moisture in thine eyes, Thy white breast heaving with the balmy air, And in thy heart and on thy kissing mouth The warmth, the joy, the impulse, and delight Of the enamour'd gentle-hearted earth Bright with the flowery fulness of the sun! THE CHANGELING. A LEGEND OF THE MOONLIGHT. I. The Asrai. ‘O let him smile as Mortals may, And be like Mortals fair, And let him tread the wondrous way Of golden earth and air; And let the sun's celestial ray Shine on his sense from day to day, Far from these waters wan, Strew flowers and fruits upon his way, And make him blest,—like Man!’ Who prays? Who cries? Who is kneeling by night Down in the Mere in the pale moonlight, Where pensive Spirits come and go In gleaming raiments as white as snow, Walking with silent and solemn tread That darkling bottom of silvern sands? Like an azure heaven, far overhead, The surface smooth of the Mere expands, Strewn thick with glimmers of starry dew Reflected down from the ether blue Those Spirits behold not. Strangely fair, With flashing fingers and flowing hair, Her face upturned in the rippling rays, Down in the Mere the Spirit prays; And on her bosom there waking lies Her Asrai babe with glittering eyes,— Silent, as white as a marble stone, It lies, but utters a feeble moan. For ere of the earth, and the air, and the dew, And the fire, that fuseth all these to one, Bright Man was fashion'd, and lived and grew, And walked erect in the shining sun, When the sun itself was eyeless and dark, And the earth was wrapped in a starry night, And the only lights that the eyes might mark Were the cold still spheres of a moon snow-white; Ev'n then, of the dew and the crystal air, And the moonray mild, were the Asrai made; And they walked and mused in the midnight air, But they had no souls and they cast no shade. They knew no hunger and mad desire, No bitter passion of mortal birth, For they were not fashion'd, like Man, from fire, They were not leavened, like Man, with earth— Cold they were as the pale moonbeam, Cold and pure as a vestal's dream. Serene they dwelt in a silvern world, Where throbbing waters stole dusky-white, Washing the feet of dark capes star-pearl'd, And arch'd by rainbows of rippling light. And when to the pæan of living things, To the cry of the new-born worlds around, Out rolled the Sun, like a shape with wings, Mighty with odour, and flame, and sound; As the dim dew shaken from Earth's dark hair, While she woke and gladdened supremely fair, In the glorious gleam of the natal ray, The pallid Asrai faded away! And when with the sunlight's fiery breath Bright Man was moulded, and stood supreme, Royal, the monarch of life and death, Shadow'd with slumber and dower'd with dream, Their trace was lost; on the human shore Those sad pale Spirits were seen no more! . . . Yet far away in the darkened places, Deep in the mountains and under the meres, A few fair Spirits with sunless faces Lingered on with the rolling years, And listened, listened, luminous-eyed, While the generations arose and died, And watch'd, watch'd, with sad surprise, The gleaming glory of earth and skies, Beyond their darkness. But ever, by night, When the moon arose with her gentle light, The Asrai, hidden from human seeing, Drank the moonlight that was their being,— Stirring about with a stealthy tread On the mountain side, on the water's bed, Or singing low and clasping hands, Shadowless moving on shining sands. But Earth with the snows of time was gray, When one of this race so meek and mild, An Asrai mother, knelt down to pray, To heaven uplifting her little child; For the Asrai with passionless chilly kiss Still mingled darkly as mortals do, And on their bosoms bare babes like this, With hair soft golden and eyes of blue, Like the eyes of stars! And she cried that night— ‘Blessed indeed is the beauteous light, And blessed are those sun-phantoms fair, For the light turns golden on their hair, And their faces are flowers and their breath is a fire, And they move about with a sweet desire In the amber day; and each night they lie Quietly smiling beneath the sky, Till the rubies of morning again are shaken Upon their eyelids, and they awaken!’ And she prayed moreover—‘Could this thing be! Could the child I nurse upon my knee, My own pale little one, blend with clay, And grow a thing of divinest day, Like those fair mortals!’ Then out of the air There came in answer unto her prayer A gentle voice; and it whispered, ‘Rise! Steal from the water, and under the skies Find a dead Mother, and on her bed A new-born Babe that is also dead; Blend thy Babe with the mortal clay, And the thing shall be as thou hast prayed— Thy Child shall walk in the golden day, Shall find a Soul, and cast a Shade!’ II. The Changeling's Birth. She rises up from the depths of the Mere And floats away on the surface clear, Like a swan she sails to the shadowy sands, And soon on the moonlit earth she stands. Moonbeam-like in the moonbeams bright, A space she lingers upon the shore, Then steals along through the dusky light Up the hill and across the moor. She sees a light that flashes afar Through the dark like a crimson star, Now it glimmers, and now is gone, For shadows come and go thereon. It comes from the shepherd's dwelling lone, Rudely fashioned of turf and stone; And the sheep dog barks, and the sheep o' the fold Huddle together in wintry cold; But within the hut the light burns low, And mortals whispering come and go; For there on the wretched truckle bed The wife of the shepherd lieth dead, And her babe new born by her side doth lie Closing its eyes with a last faint cry. . . . The Spirit trembles, as on her hair Flasheth the firelight's crimson glare; Trembles and fades; but she draweth near, Eager to see, eager to hear. Close to the window-pane she flees, And looketh in! In the room she sees, None stir: 'tis empty; but on the bed The child and mother are lying dead. The light burns low; the clock ticks slow; Spectral shadows come and go; From the room without a murmur creeps Of whispered words, and one that weeps. O Moon! still Moon! Sweet and white as a lily in June, In the garden of heaven bend thy brows And waft thy breathing into the house! For the pallid creature of thy breath The cottage window openeth, And stealeth in. Like a moonray bright, Holding her own babe in her hands, And bending above that bed, snow white She stands! Find a dead Mother, and on her bed A new-born Babe that is also dead. Blend thy Babe with the mortal clay And the thing shall pass as thou hast prayed: Thy child shall walk in the golden day, Shall find a Soul, and shall cast a Shade. O Moon! still Moon! The wonderful spell is woven soon! Breathe again on her hair and eyes, As she creepeth out, and under the skies Listens! O hark! from within is blown A child's low murmur, an infant's moan! Shadows darken across the pane, For the peasants gather wondering-eyed— The child of the shepherd lives again, Smiling awake by the corpse's side. III. His Mortal Life. Weary to tell and weary to hear Were the mortal life for many a year Of that changeling child; but he grew on earth, Knowing nought of his mystic birth, And ever waxed more strong and fair, With the glory of daylight on eyes and hair. And the poor pale Mother Spirit smiled From far away on her happy child, Thinking, ‘He thrives, and the golden hours Fill his lap with their fruit and flowers, And he feels the sun, and he drinks its light, Growing on to a mortal's height.’ And ever nightly unseen she came And kiss'd him asleep, to her heart's desire, Though his breath met hers with the fever'd flame Of a fatal fire. She watched him still with a hunger keen, Stronger than mortal mothers know; She hover'd o'er him, unheard, unseen, Wherever his feet might come and go, In the sunless hours; and all the day She marked his motion from far away, And heard his voice, through the shine and the shower, Like the voice of a bird! But there came an hour When the Shepherd who called him son lay dead, And when he was buried the Changeling said— ‘I will take my staff, and will leave this place, And seek new fortunes—God give me grace That I prosper well!’ And away he went, Humming an old tune, well-content, Hopeful and fearless, merry and gay, Over the hills and far away; And all alone! IV. His Sorrow and Sin. Yet not alone, For step by step, and stone by stone, Where'er he rested—fleet as wind, His Spirit Mother came behind; Creeping to darkness all the day, But ever in the cold moonray Finding his footprints, kissing them, And often where his raiment hem Had brushed the warm dew from the grass, Strewing pale flowers. Thus did she pass Till brazen city gates by night She saw him enter. Still and white, She followed. Weary to tell and hear Were the Changeling's doings for many a year. But the Spirit saw as the time fled on That his cheek grew paler, his bright eye shone Less happy and bright; for he dwelt, behold! Where men and women were heaping gold And counting gems; and a yellow gleam Shadowed the sight and darkened the dream Of his gentle face; and by lamplight now He read and pondered with pallid brow O'er parchment scrolls, and tomes which told Of mystic manners of finding gold. Then, even then, across him came So strange a change, so fierce a flame, That he, forgetting fever-fraught All things but that one thing he sought, Was wrapt all round with light of dread! And ever tossing on his bed He named a woman's name, and cried That God would bring her to his side, His and none other's; and all day He fevered in the hot sunray Behind her footprints. Ne'ertheless His thirst was turned to bitterness, His love to pain; and soon by night The Spirit saw him standing white, Transfigured in a dumb despair, And his wild shriek rose on the air, While from a far off bridal room Came wafted through the summer gloom The sound of harps and lutes! Then came Long days and nights of sin and shame. For in his agony the Man Kept hideous orgies, and his wan Wild features gleamed in ghastly mirth, While naked women-snakes of earth Twined round him fawning; and he drew Dark curtains, shutting out the blue, And the sweet sun; and all the nights, In feverish flash of ghastly lights, He slew pure sleep with sounds of sin. Then the pale Mother peeping in Beheld his mad distorted face, And knew it not! Time sped apace, And lo! he changed, and forth again He fared, amid a mighty train, A Warrior now; and to the sound Of martial strains his head swam round, His heart kept time; while overhead Strange suns of sorrow glimmered red. . . . Weary to tell and weary to hear The Changeling's doings for many a year! Weary to tell how the Spirit dim Moaning in misery followed him, For whene'er she gazed on his features now, On the bearded chin and the branded brow, She shuddered, and often, when she crept Into the tent where the warrior slept, She saw on his hand a blood-red stain. And she kissed the stain again and again With her cold pure lips,—but it would not go! V. The Battle-Field. One night she walked with a foot of snow Thro' a battle-field; and the Moon on high Swam thro' the film of a starry sky, And the breath of the Moon, like hoar-frost shed, Gleamed on the dreadful drifts of dead. Then she saw him standing amid it all Living and bloody, ghastly and tall, With a hand on his moaning horse's mane! And his face was awful with hate and pain, And his eyes were mad—for beneath him lay, Quivering there in the pale moonray, A wounded foe—while with red right hand He held in the air a bloody brand To cleave him down! Before his look One moment the Spirit Mother shook; He could not hear her, he could not see, But she shriek'd aloud in her agony! He glared all round him like one in dread Of a voice from heaven or a ghost from the dead, And he sheathed his sword with a shudder soon, Alone in the light of the lonely Moon . . . O Moon! immortal Moon! VI. The Abbot Paul. Fourscore years have come and gone, Since the Asrai Mother knelt down and prayed, Since the boon was gained, and her little one Found a soul and cast a shade; And now by the side of the same still Mere, A mighty Monastery stands, And morn and even its bell rings clear, Tinkling over the silver sands; And the Asrai as they come and go Hear the sounds in the waters below, And ever to them the sweet sounds seem Like distant music heard in a dream, And they pause and smile, and they murmur ‘Hark,’ With uplifted fingers! Old, old, old, With hoary hair and beard snow-white, With vacant vision and senses cold, Crawling out to feel the light— Like a man of marble, gaunt and tall, Heavy with years, is the Abbot Paul. Fourscore years have slowly shed Their snows on the mighty Abbot's head— But not so white are his thoughts within, That tell of a long dark life of sin. Ever he totters and grows to the ground, And ever by night he hears a sound Of voices that whisper his name and weep; And he starteth up in his nightly sleep With a touch like a hand upon his hair, And he looketh around in a sick despair, But he seëth nought. And he prayeth low: .Pity me, God; and let me go Out of the sunlight,—shaking away This form fire-fashioned out of clay!’ And often his dark beads counteth he: ‘Maria Madonna, come for me! For I am sick of the sinful light.’ Now ever he readeth low each night In a parchment scroll, with pictures quaint Of many a shining-headed Saint Smiling, each 'mid his aureole, O'er the dark characters of the scroll; And ever when he totters abroad He bears this parchment scroll of God Against his heart; or in the sun He spells its letters one by one With dim dark eyes, as he creepeth slow. . . 'Tis a summer even. The sun sinks low, And the light of its solemn setting lies Golden and crimson on the skies, Purple over the brow of the hill, And violet dim on the waters still Of the glassy Mere. In the zenith blue, Already, dim as drops of dew, Twinkle the stars! In his great arm-chair, Carried out to the open air, On the edge of a promontory sweet, With the waters rippling at his feet, Sits the Abbot Paul; and his fingers cold Still grip that parchment holy and old. Behind his chair there standeth grim With cold black eyeball fix'd on him, A serving-monk. The air is chill, The light is low, but he readeth still, Mumbling the sacred words aloud; And ever his weary neck is bowed At the names of Mary and every Saint; While ever fainter and more faint His voice doth grow, as he murmureth: ‘Holy of Holies, drink my breath! For I am sick of the sinful light!’ . . . The sun hath sunken out of sight In the cloudy west afar away— Chilly it groweth, chilly and gray— But who is this with steps so still Coming yonder across the hill? Over the peaks with a silvern tread Flashing, then rising overhead In the open heaven of a golden June? O Moon! white Summer Moon! Down the mountain and into the Mere The pale ray falleth, so silvern clear, And it creepeth silently over all, Till it shineth full on the Abbot Paul, Where he sits and prays. O see! O see! Sadder, stiller, groweth he, But his eyes still burn with a dying gleam; While faint, far off, as in a dream, He hears a murmur, he sees a light. Silently, coldly, marble white, Pale and pure as the moonray dim, Smiling, outstretching her arms to him, His Spirit Mother upriseth now! A light not human is on his brow, A light no human is in his eyes— Fold by fold, like a dark disguise, The mortal dress is dropping away; Silently, slowly, sinks the clay; His eyes see clear by some mystic spell, And he knoweth the gentle presence well. ‘O Mother! Mother!’ She answereth low: ‘Come from the gleam of the golden glow, From the wicked flush of the fever'd strife, Back to the mystical moonlight life! Thy heart is heavy, thy sense is drear, Weary with wandering many a year— Come from the sorrows of the Sun! My own pale darling, my little one!’ ‘O Mother! Mother!’ Her arms so dim Are round his neck, and she kisseth him! She smoothes his hair with a gentle hand, And she sings a song of the moonlight land. He listens and listens, but still in a dream Looking afar off his dark eyes gleam, Beyond her, through her, at some strange thing There on the hilltops, beckoning!. . . Dead in his chair lies the Abbot Paul, But a Shape stands by him, stately and tall, And another Shape upon her knee Is looking up in her agony. ‘O Mother! Mother!’ the tall Shape cries, Gazing on her with gentle eyes— ‘O Mother, Mother, I cannot stay— A voice is summoning me away— Up the shining track of the sun, Past the sphere of the spectral moon, Further, higher, my path must run— I have found a Soul, and thou hast thy boon; And the Soul is a scourge, and the scourge a fire, And it shoots me onward to strive and soar, For this is the end of thy heart's desire— I rest not, stay not, for evermore. O kiss me, Mother, before I go!’ They kiss each other, those shapes of snow, They cling in the moonlight, they kiss each other— ‘Child, my child!’ and ‘Mother! Mother!’ Silently, swiftly, through the air Riseth one like a meteor fair, Riseth one with a last wild cry, While the other sinks in a silent swoon, And whiter, brighter, over the sky, Burneth the light of that night of June! O Moon! sad Summer Moon! TO CLARI. WITH THE PRECEDING POEM. Though on the dullest dust we tread, Our days are closed about with dread; Before our footsteps and behind Burns the white Light that keeps us blind. If Life were all, if Love were clay, If the great Dream could pass away, If thou or I could cease to be, That Light would fade, and we should see: Yea, see and know, and swiftly pass, Like shapes from a magician's glass;— But girt by godhead we remain, Though human systems wax and wane. Enough! we fear not, thou and I, Knowing we were not born to die, Because, at every step we tread, Our days are closed about with dread. North Coast, and other Poems. (1867–68.) MEG BLANE. I. Storm. ‘Lord, hearken to me! Save all poor souls at sea! Thy breath is on their cheeks,— Their cheeks are wan wi' fear; Nae man speaks, For wha could hear? The wild white water screams, The wind cries loud; The fireflaught gleams On tattered sail and shroud! Under the red mast-light The hissing surges slip; Thick reeks the storm o' night Round him that steers the ship,— And his een are blind, And he kens not where they run. Lord, be kind! Whistle back Thy wind, For the sake of Christ Thy Son!’ . . . And as she prayed she knelt not on her knee, But, standing on the threshold, looked to Sea, Where all was blackness and a watery roar, Save when the dead light, flickering far away, Flash'd on the line of foam upon the shore, And showed the ribs of reef and surging bay! There was no sign of life across the dark, No piteous light from fishing-boat or bark, Albeit for such she hush'd her heart to pray. With tattered plaid wrapt tight around her form, She stood a space, spat on by wind and rain, Then, sighing deep, and turning from the Storm, She crept into her lonely hut again. 'Twas but a wooden hut under the height, Shielded in the black shadow of the crag: One blow of such a wind as blew that night Could rend so rude a dwelling like a rag. There, gathering in the crannies overhead, Down fell the spouting rain heavy as lead,— So that the old roof and the rafters thin Dript desolately, looking on the surf, While blacker rain-drops down the walls of turf Splash'd momently on the mud-floor within. There, swinging from the beam, an earthen lamp Waved to the wind and glimmered in the damp, And shining in the chamber's wretchedness, Illumed the household things of the poor place, And flicker'd faintly on the woman's face Sooted with rain, and on her dripping dress. A miserable den wherein to dwell, And yet she loved it well. ‘O Mither, are ye there?’ A deep voice filled the dark; she thrill'd to hear; With hard hand she pushed back her wild wet hair, And kissed him. ‘Whisht, my bairn, for Mither's near.’ Then on the shuttle bed a figure thin Sat rubbing sleepy eyes: A bearded man, with heavy hanging chin, And on his face a light not over-wise. ‘Water!’ he said; and deep his thirst was quelled Out of the broken pitcher she upheld, And yawning sleepily, he gazed around, And stretched his limbs again, and soon slept sound. Stooping, she smooth'd his pillow 'neath his head, Still looking down with eyes liquid and mild, And while she gazed, softly he slumberëd, That bearded man, her child. And a child's dreams were his; for as he lay, He uttered happy cries as if at play, And his strong hand was lifted up on high As if to catch the bird or butterfly; And often to his bearded lips there came That lonely woman's name; And though the wrath of Ocean roared so near, That one sweet word Was all the woman heard, And all she cared to hear. Not old in years, though youth had passed away, And the thin hair was tinged with silver gray, Close to the noontide of the day of life, She stood, calm featured like a wedded wife; And yet no wedded wife was she, but one Whose foot had left the pathways of the just, Yet meekly, since her penance had been done, Her soft eyes sought men's faces, not the dust. Her tearful days were over: she had found Firm footing, work to do upon the ground; The Elements had welded her at length To their own truth and strength. This woman was no slight and tear-strung thing, Whose easy sighs fall soft on suffering, But one in whom no stranger's eyes would seek For pity mild and meek. Man's height was hers—man's strength and will thereto, Her shoulders broad, her step man-like and long; 'Mong fishermen she dwelt, a rude, rough crew, And more than one had found her hand was strong. And yet her face was gentle, though the sun Had made it dark and dun; Her silver-threaded hair Was combed behind her ears with cleanly care; And she had eyes liquid and sorrow-fraught, And round her mouth were delicate lines, that told She was a woman sweet with her own thought, Though built upon a large, heroic mould. Who did not know Meg Blane? What hearth but heard the deeds that Meg had done? What fisher of the main But knew her, and her little-witted son? For in the wildest waves of that wild coast Her black boat hover'd and her net was tost, And lonely in the watery solitude The son and mother fished for daily food. When on calm nights the herring hosts went by, Her frail boat followed the red smacks from shore And steering in the stern the man would lie While Meg was hoisting sail or plying oar; Till, a black speck against the morning sky, The boat came homeward, with its silver store. And Meg was cunning in the ways of things, Watching what every changing lineament Of wind and sky and cloud and water meant, Knowing how Nature threatens ere she springs. She knew the clouds as shepherds know their sheep, To eyes unskilled alike, yet different each; She knew the wondrous voices of the Deep; The tones of sea-birds were to her a speech. Much faith was hers in God, who was her guide; Courage was hers such as God gives to few, For she could face His terrors fearless-eyed, Yet keep the still sane woman's nature true. Lives had she snatched out of the waste by night, When wintry winds were blowing; To sick-beds sad her presence carried light, When (like a thin sail lessening out of sight) Some rude, rough life to the unknown Gulf was going; For men who scorned a feeble woman's wail Would heark to one so strong and brave as she, Whose face had braved the lightning and the gale, And ne'er grown pale, Before the shrill threat of the murderous Sea. Yet often, as she lay a-sleeping there, This woman started up and blush'd in shame, Stretching out arm embracing the thin air, Naming an unknown name; There was a hearkening hunger in her face If sudden footsteps sounded on her ear; And when strange seamen came unto the place She read their faces in a wretched fear; And finding not the object of her quest, Her hand she held hard on her heaving breast, And wore a white look, and drew feeble breath, Like one that hungereth. It was a night of summer, yet the wind Had wafted from God's wastes the rainclouds dank, Blown out Heaven's thousand eyes and left it blind, Though now and then the Moon gleamed moist behind The rack, till, smitten by the drift, she sank. But the Deep roared; Sucked to the black clouds, spumed the foam-fleck'd main, While lightning rent the storm-rack like a sword, And earthward rolled the gray smoke of the Rain. 'Tis late, and yet the woman doth not rest, But sitteth with chin drooping on her breast: Weary she is, yet will not take repose; Tired are her eyes, and yet they cannot close; She rocketh to and fro upon her chair, And stareth at the air! Far, far away her thoughts were travelling: They could not rest—they wandered far and fleet, As the storm-petrels o'er the waters wing, And cannot find a place to rest their feet; And in her ear a thin voice murmurëd, ‘If he be dead—be dead!’ Then, even then, the woman's face went white And awful, and her eyes were fixed in fear, For suddenly all the wild screams of night Were hushed: the Wind lay down; and she could hear Strange voices gather round her in the gloom, Sounds of invisible feet across the room, And after that the rustle of a shroud, And then a creaking door, And last the coronach, full shrill and loud, Of women clapping hands and weeping sore. Now Meg knew well that ill was close at hand, On water or on land, Because the Glamour touched her lids like breath, And scorch'd her heart: but in a waking swoon, Quiet she stayed,—not stirring,—cold as death, And felt those voices croon; Then suddenly she heard a human shout, The hurried falling of a foot without, Then a hoarse voice—a knocking at the door— ‘Meg, Meg! A Ship ashore!’ Now mark the woman! She hath risen her height, Her dripping plaid is wrapt around her tight, Tight clenchëd in her palm her fingers are Her eye is steadfast as a fixëd star. One look upon her child—he sleepeth on— One step unto the door, and she is gone: Barefooted out into the dark she fares, And comes where, rubbing eyelids thick with sleep, The half-clad fishers mingle oaths and prayers, And look upon the Deep. . . . Black was the oozy lift, Black was the sea and land; Hither and thither, thick with foam and drift, Did the deep Waters shift, Swinging with iron clash on stone and sand. Faintlier the heavy Rain was falling, Faintlier, faintlier the Wind was calling, With hollower echoes up the drifting dark! While the swift rockets shooting through the night Flash'd past the foam-flecked reef with phantom light, And showed the piteous outline of the bark, Rising and falling like a living thing, Shuddering, shivering, While, howling beastlike, the white breakers there Spat blindness in the dank eyes of despair. Then one cried, ‘She has sunk!’—and on the shore Men shook, and on the heights the women cried; But, lo! the outline of the bark once more! While flashing faint the blue light rose and died. Ah, God, put out Thy hand! all for the sake Of little ones, and weary hearts that wake Be gentle! chain the fierce waves with a chain! Let the gaunt seaman's little boys and girls Sit on his knee and play with his black curls Yet once again! And breathe the frail lad safely through the foam Back to the hungry mother in her home! And spare the bad man with the frenzied eye; Kiss him, for Christ's sake, bid Thy Death go by— He hath no heart to die! Now faintlier blew the wind, the thin rain ceased, The thick cloud cleared like smoke from off the strand, For, lo! a bright blue glimmer in the East,— God putting out His hand! And overhead the rack grew thinner too, And through the smoky gorge The Wind drave past the stars, and faint they flew Like sparks blown from a forge! And now the thousand foam-flames o' the Sea Hither and thither flashing visibly; And gray lights hither and thither came and fled, Like dim shapes searching for the drownëd dead; And where these shapes most thickly glimmer'd by, Out on the cruel reef the black hulk lay, And cast, against the kindling eastern sky, Its shape gigantic on the shrouding spray. Silent upon the shore, the fishers fed Their eyes on horror, waiting for the close, When in the midst of them a shrill voice rose: ‘The boat! the boat!’ it said. Like creatures startled from a trance, they turned To her who spake; tall in the midst stood she, With arms uplifted, and with eyes that yearned Out on the murmuring Sea. Some, shrugging shoulders, homeward turned their eyes, And others answered back in brutal speech; But some, strong-hearted, uttering shouts and cries, Followed the fearless woman up the beach. A rush to seaward—black confusion—then A struggle with the surf upon the strand— 'Mid shrieks of women, cries of desperate men, The long oars smite, the black boat springs from land! Around the thick spray flies; The waves roll on and seem to overwhelm. With blowing hair and onward-gazing eyes The woman stands erect, and grips the helm. . . . Now fearless heart, Meg Blane, or all must die! Let not the skill'd hand thwart the steadfast eye The crested wave comes near,—crag-like it towers Above you, scattering round its chilly showers: One flutter of the hand, and all is done! Now steel thy heart, thou woman-hearted one! Softly the good helm guides; Round to the liquid ridge the boat leaps light,— Hidden an instant,—on the foaming height, Dripping and quivering like a bird, it rides. Athwart the ragged rift the Moon looms pale, Driven before the gale, And making silvern shadows with her breath, Where on the sighing Sea it shimmereth; And, lo! the light illumes the reef; 'tis shed Full on the wreck, as the dark boat draws nigh. A crash!—the wreck upon the reef is fled; A scream!—and all is still beneath the sky, Save the wild waters as they whirl and cry. II. Dead Calm. Dawn; and the Deep was still. From the bright strand, Meg, shading eyes against the morning sun, Gazed seaward. After trouble, there was peace. Smooth, many-coloured as a ring-dove's neck Stretch'd the still Sea, and on its eastern rim The dewy light, with liquid yellow beams, Gleamed like a sapphire. Overhead, soft airs To feathery cirrus flecked the lightening blue, Beneath, the Deep's own breathing made a breeze; And up the weedy beach the blue waves crept, Falling in one thin line of cream-white foam. Seaward the woman gazed, with keen eye fixed On a dark shape that floated on the calm, Drifting as seaweed; still and black it lay,— The outline of a lifeless human shape: And yet it was no drownëd mariner, For she who looked was smiling, and her face Looked merry; still more merry when a boat, With pale and timorous fishermen, drew nigh; And as the fearful boatmen paused and gazed, A boat's length distant, leaning on their oars, The shape took life—dash'd up a dripping head, Screaming—flung up its limbs with flash of foam, And, with a shrill and spirit-thrilling cry, Dived headlong, as a monster of the main Plunges deep down when startled on its couch Of glassy waters. 'Twas the woman's child, The witless water-haunter—Angus Blane. For Angus Blane, not fearful as the wise Are fearful, loved the Ocean like a thing Born amid algæ of the slimy ooze. A child, he sported on its sands, and crept Splashing with little feet amid the foam; And when his limbs were stronger, and he reached A young man's stature, the great Gulf had grown Fair and familiar as his mother's face. Far out he swam, on windless summer days, Floating like fabled mermen far from land, Plunging away from startled fishermen With eldrich cry and wild phantasmic glare, And in the untrodden halls below the sea Awaking wondrous echoes that had slept Since first the briny Spirit stirred and breathed. On nights of summer in the gleaming bay He glistened like a sea-snake in the moon, Splashing with trail of glistening phosphorfire, And laughing shrill till echo answer'd him, And the pale helmsman on the passing boat, Thinking some Demon of the waters cried, Shivered and prayed. His playmates were the waves, The sea his playground. On his ears were sounds Sweeter than human voices. On his sense, Though sadden'd with his silent life, there stole A motion and a murmur that at times Brake through his lips, informing witless words With strange sea-music. In his infancy, Children had mocked him: he had shunned their sports, And haunted lonely places, nurturing The bright, fierce, animal splendour of a soul That ne'er was clouded by the mental mists That darken oft the dreams of wiser men. Only in winter seasons he was sad; For then the loving Spirit of the Deep Repulsed him, and its smile was mild no more; And on the strand he wandered; from dark caves Gazed at the Tempest; and from day to day Moaned to his mother for the happy time When swifts are sailing on the wind o' the South, And summer smiles afar off through the rain, Bringing her golden circlet to the Sea. And as the deepening of strange melody, Caught from the unknown shores beyond the seas, Was the outspreading of his life to her Who bare him; yea, at times, the woman's womb Seemed laden with the load of him unborn, So close his being clave unto her flesh, So link'd was his strange spirit with her own. The faint forebodings of her heart, when first She saw the mind-mists in his infant eyes, And knew him witless, turned as years wore on Into more spiritual, less selfish love Than common mothers feel; and he had power To make her nature deeper, more alive Unto the supernatural feet that walk Our dark and troubled waters. Thence was born Much of her strength upon the Sea, her trust In the Sea's Master! thence, moreover, grew Her faith in visions, warnings, fantasies, Such as came ever thronging on her heart When most her eyes looked inward—to the place Fraught with her secret sorrow. As she gazed, Smiling, the bearded face of Angus rose Nearer to shore, and panting in the sun, Smiled at the fishers. Then the woman turned, And took, with man-like step and slow, a path That, creeping through the shadows of the cliffs, Wound to the clachan. In the clear, bright dawn Lay Thornock glittering, while, thin and blue, Curl'd peat-smoke from the line of fisher-huts That parted the high shingle from the land, The tide was low: amid the tangled weeds The many-coloured rocks and sparkling pools, Went stooping men and women, seeking spoil, Treasure or drift-wood floating from the wreck; Beyond, some stood in fish-boats, peering down, Seeking the drownëd dead; and, near at hand, So near, a tall man might have waded thither With a dry beard, the weedy reef loom'd red, And there the white-fowl ever and anon Rose like a flash of foam, whirl'd in the air, And, screaming, settled. But not thitherward Now look'd Meg Blane. Along the huts she went— Among the rainy pools where played and cried Brown and barefooted bairns—among the nets Stretch'd steaming in the sun—until she reached The cottage she was seeking. At the door, Smoking his pipe, a grizzly Fisher sat, Looking to sea. With him she spake awhile, Then, with a troubled look, entered the hut, And sought the inner chamber. Faint and pale Light glimmer'd through a loop-hole in the wall, A deep white streak across the sand-strewn floor, All else in shadow; and the room was still, Save for a heavy breathing, as of one In quiet sleep. Within the wall's recess, On the rude bed of straw the sleeper lay, His head upon his arm, the sickly light Touching his upturn'd face; while Meg drew near, And gazed upon him with a stranger's eyes, Quiet and pitying. Though his sleep was sound, His dreams were troubled. Throwing up his arms, He seemed to beckon, muttering; then his teeth Clench'd tight, a dark frown wrinkled on his brow, And still he lay like one awaiting doom; But suddenly, in agony supreme, He breathed like one who struggles, sinks, and drowns; Strangling, with wavering arms and quivering limbs, And screaming in his throat, he fought for life; Till, half-awakening with the agony, His glazëd eyes he opened, glaring round, While Meg drew shivering back into the shade; Again, with deeper breath, as if relieved, He dropp'd his bearded face upon his arm, And dream'd again. Then Meg stole stilly forth, And in the outer chamber found a lamp, And lit the same in silence, and returned On tiptoe to the sleeper. As she went, White as a murdered woman's grew her face, Her teeth were clench'd together; and her eyes With ring on ring of widening wonder glared In fever'd fascination upon him Who slumbered. Closer still she crept, Holding the lamp aloft, until his breath Was hot upon her cheek,—so gaunt, so white, It seemed her time was come. Yet in her look Was famine. As one famish'd looks on food After long agony, and thinks it dream, She gazed and gazed, nor stirred, nor breathed, nor lived, Save in her spirit's hunger flashing forth Out of her face; till suddenly the man, Half-opening his eyes, reached out his arms And gript her, crying, ‘Silence! pray to God! She's sinking!’ then, with shrill and awful groan, Awakened. And the woman would have fled, Had he not gript her. In her face he gazed, Thrusting one hand into his silvered hair, Seeking to gather close his scattered thoughts, And his eye brightened, and he murmured low, ‘Where am I? Dead or living? Ah, I live! The ship? the ship?’ Meg answered not, but shrank Into the shadow; till she saw the mists Pass from his bearded face and leave it clear, And heard his voice grow calmer, measured now By tranquil heart-beats. Then he asked again, ‘The ship? How many live of those aboard?’ And when she answered he alone was saved, He groaned; but with a sailor's fearless look, ‘Thank God for that!’ he said; ‘and yet He might Have spared a better man. Where am I, friend?’ ‘On the north coast,’ said Meg, ‘upon the shore At Thornock.’ Could the seaman, while she spake, Have marked the lurid light on that pale face, All else,—the Storm, the terrible fight for life,— Had been forgotten; but his wearied eye Saw dimly. Grasping still her quivering wrist, He question'd on; and, summoning strength of heart, In her rude speech she told him of the storm: How from the reef the rending Ship had rolled As aid drew nigh; how, hovering near its tomb, The fishers from the whirling waters dragged Two drownëd seamen, and himself, a corpse In seeming; how by calm and tender care, They wound his thin and bloody thread of life Out of the slowly-loosening hands of Death. III. A Troubled Deep. Then, with strange trouble in her eyes, Meg Blane Stole swiftly back unto her hut again, Like one that flyeth from some fearful thing; Then sat and made a darkness, covering Her face with apron old, thinking apart; And yet she scarce could think, for ache of heart, But saw dead women and dead men go by, And felt the wind, and heard the waters cry, And on the waters, as they washed to shore, Saw one Face float alone and glimmer hoar Through the green darkness of the breaking brine. And Meg was troubled deep, nor could divine The wherefore of her trouble, since 'twas clear The face long wearied for at last was near, Since all her waiting on was at an end. Ay, Meg was dull, and could not comprehend How God put out His breath that day, and blew Her lover to her feet before she knew, Yet misted the dull future from her sight; Wherefore she stared stark down on her delight As on a dead face washing in from sea. But when she understood full certainly The thing had come according to her prayer, Her strength came back upon her unaware, And she thank'd God, albeit the pleasure seemed Less absolute a bliss than she had dreamed When it was a sweet trouble far away; For she was conscious how her hair was gray, Her features worn, her flesh's freshness gone, Through toiling in the sun and waiting on; And quietly she murmur'd, weeping not, ‘Perchance—for men forget—he hath forgot!’ And two long days she was too dazed and weak To step across the sands to him, and speak; But on the third day, pale with her intent, She took the great hand of her son, and went, Not heeding while the little-witted one, Mouth'd at the sea and muttered in the sun, And firmly stepping on along the shore, She saw, afar off at the cottage door, The figure of her shipwrecked mariner; When, deeply troubled by a nameless fear, She lingered, and she lingered, pale and wan. Then, coming near, she noted how the man Sat sickly, holding out his arm to please A fisher child he held between his knees, Whose eyes looked on the mighty arm and bare, Where ships, strange faces, anchors, pictured were, Prick'd blue into the skin with many a stain; And, sharply marking the man's face, Meg Blane Was cheered and holpen, and she trembled less, Thinking, ‘His heart is full of kindliness.’ And, feeling that the thing if to be done Must be done straight, she hastened with her son, And, though she saw the man's shape growing dim, Came up with sickly smile and spake to him, Pausing not, though she scarce could hear or see— ‘Has Angus Macintyre forgotten me?’ And added quickly, ‘I am Maggie Blane!’ Whereat the man was smit by sudden pain And wonder—yea, the words he heard her speak Were like a jet of fire upon his cheek; And, rising up erect, ‘Meg Blane!’ he cried, And, white and chilly, thrust the bairn aside, And peered upon the woman all amazed, While, pressing hard upon her heart, she gazed Blankly at the dim mist she knew was he. For a short space both stood confusedly, In silence; but the man was first to gain Calmness to think and power to speak again; And, though his lips were bloodless and prest tight, Into his eyes he forced a feeble light, Taking her shivering hand, naming her name In forced kind tones, yet with a secret shame;— Nor sought to greet her more with touch or kiss. But she, who had waited on so long for this, Feeling her hand between his fingers rest, Could bear no more, but fell upon his breast, Sobbing and moaning like a little bairn. Then, with her wild arms round him, he looked stern, With an unwelcome burden ill at ease, While her full heart flowed out in words like these— ‘At last! at last! O Angus, let me greet! To greet; Anglicè, to weep. God's good! I ever hoped that we would meet! Lang, lang hae I been waiting by the Sea, Waiting and waiting, praying on my knee; And God said I should look again on you, And, though I scarce believed, God's word comes true, And He hath put an end to my distress!’— E'en as she spoke, her son plucked at her dress, Made fierce grimaces at the man, and tried To draw her from the breast whereon she cried; But looking up, she pointed to her child, And look'd into her lover's eyes, and smiled. ‘God help him, Angus! 'Tis the Bairn!’ she said;— Nor noted how the man grew shamed and red, With child and mother ill at ease and wroth, And wishing he were many a mile from both. For now Meg's heart was wandering far away, And to her soul it seemed but yesterday That, standing inland in a heathery dell, At dead of night, she bade this man farewell, And heard him swear full fondly in her ear Sooner or late to come with gold and gear, And marry her in church by holy rite; And at the memory a quiet light, Rose-like and maiden, came upon her face, And softened her tall shape to nameless grace, As warm winds blowing on a birk-tree green Make it one rippling sheet of radiant sheen. But soon from that remembrance driven again By the man's silence and his pallid pain, She shivered for a moment as with cold, And left his bosom, looking grieved and old, Yet smiling, forcing a strange smile, and seeking For tokens in his face more sweet than speaking. But he was dumb, and with a pallid frown, Twitching his fingers quick, was looking down. ‘What ails thee, Angus?’ cried the woman, reading His face with one sharp look of interceding; Then, looking downward too, she paused apart, With blood like water slipping through her heart, Because she thought, ‘Alas, if it should be That Angus cares no more for mine and me, Since I am old and worn with sharp distress, And men like pretty looks and daintiness; And since we parted twenty years have past, And that, indeed, is long for a man's love to last!’ But, agonised with looking at her woe, And bent to end her hope with one sharp blow, The troubled man, uplifting hands, spake thus, In rapid accents, sharp and tremulous: ‘Too late, Meg Blane! seven years ago I wed Another woman, deeming you were dead,— And I have bairns!’ And there he paused, for fear. As when, with ghostly voices in her ear, While in her soul, as in a little well The silver moonlight of the Glamour fell, She had been wont to hark of nights alone, So stood she now, not stirring, still as stone, While in her soul, with desolate refrain, The words, ‘Too late!’ rang o'er and o'er again; Into his face she gazed with ghastly stare; Then raising her wild arms into the air, Pinching her face together in sharp fear, She quivered to the ground without a tear, And put her face into her hands, and thrust Her hair between her teeth, and spat it forth like dust. And though, with pity in his guilty heart, The man spake on and sought to heal her smart, She heard not, but was dumb and deaf in woe; But when, in pain to see her grieving so, Her son put down his hand, and named her name, And whispered, ‘Mither! mither! let us hame!’ She seized the hand, and smoothed her features wan, And rose erect, not looking at the man, But, gazing down, moved slowly from the spot. Over this agony I linger not. Nor shall I picture how on that sad shore They met and spoke and parted yet once more, So calmly that the woman understood Her hope indeed had gone away for good. But ere the man departed from the place It seemed to Meg, contemplating his face, Her love for him had ne'er been so intense As it had seemed when he was far from thence; And many a thing in him seemed little-hearted And mean and loveless; so that ere they parted She seemed unto her sorrow reconciled. And when he went away, she almost smiled, But bitterly, then turned to toil again, And felt most hard to all the world of men. IV. ‘And the Spirit of God moved upon the waters.’ Lord, with how small a thing Thou canst prop up the heart against the grave! A little glimmering Is all we crave! The lustre of a love That hath no being, The pale point of a little star above Flashing and fleeing, Contents our seeing. The house that never will be built; the gold That never will be told; The task we leave undone when we are cold; The dear face that returns not, but is lying, Lick'd by the leopard, in an Indian cave; The coming rest that cometh not, till, sighing, We turn our tremulous gaze upon the grave. And, Lord, how should we dare Thither in peace to fall, But for a feeble glimmering even there— Falsest, some sigh, of all? We are as children in Thy hands indeed, And Thou hast easy comfort for our need,— The shining of a lamp, the tinkling of a bell, Content us well. And even when Thou bringest to our eyes A thing long-sought, to show its worthlessness, Anon we see another thing arise, And we are comforted in our distress; And, waiting on, we watch it glittering, Till in its turn it seems a sorry thing; And even as we weep Another rises, and we smile again! Till, wearied out with watching on in vain, We fall to sleep. And oft one little light that looks divine Is all some strong Soul seeks on mortal ground; There are no more to shine When that one thing is found. If it be worthless, then what shall suffice? The lean hand grips a speck that was a spark, The heart is turned to ice, And all the world is dark. Hard are Thy ways when that one thing is sought, Found, touch'd, and proven nought. Far off it is a mighty magic, strong To lead a life along. But, lo! it shooteth thitherward, and now Droppeth, a rayless stone, upon the sod.— The world is lost: perchance not even Thou Survivest it, Lord God! In poverty, in pain, For weary years and long, One faith, one fear, had comforted Meg Blane, Yea, made her brave and strong; A faith so faint it seemed not faith at all, Rather a trouble and a dreamy fear,— A hearkening for a voice, for a footfall, She never hoped in sober heart to heart This had been all her cheer! Yet with this balm Her Soul might have slept calm For many another year. In terror and in desolation, she Had been sustained, And never felt abandoned utterly While that remained. Lord, in how small and poor a space can hide The motives of our patience and our pride,— The clue unto the fortunate man's distress, The secret of the hero's fearlessness! What had sustained this Woman on the sea When strong men turned to flee? Not courage, not despair, Not pride, not household care, Not faith in Thee! Nought but a hungry instinct blind and dim— A fond pathetic pain: A dreamy wish to gaze again on him She never wholly hoped to see again! Not all at once,—not in an hour, a day Did the strong Woman feel her force depart, Or know how utterly had passed away The strength of her sad heart. It was not Love she missed, for Love was dead, And surely had been dead long ere she knew; She did not miss the man's face when it fled, As passionate women do. She saw him walk into the world again, And had no pain; She shook him by the hand, and watched him go, And thought it better so. She turned to her hard task-work as of old, Tending her bearded child with love tenfold, Hoisted the sails and plied the oar, Went wandering out from shore, And for a little space Wore an unruffled face, Though wind and water helped her heart no more. But, mark: she knelt less often on her knees, For, labour as she might, By day or night, She could not toil enough to give her ease. And presently her tongue, with sharper chimes, Chided at times; And she who had endured such sharp distress Grew peevish, pain'd at her own peevishness; And though she did not weep, Her features grew disfigur'd, dark, and dead, And in the night, when bitterest mourners sleep, She feverishly tossed upon her bed. Slowly the trouble grew, and soon she found Less pleasure in the fierce yet friendly Sea; The wind and water had a wearier sound, The moon and stars were sick as corpselights be; Then more and more strange voices filled her ear, And ghostly feet came near, And strange fire blew her eyelids down, and then Dead women and dead men Dripping with phosphor, rose, and ere she wist Went by in a cold mist; Nor left her strengthen'd in her heart and bold, As they had done of old; But ever after they had stolen away She had no heart to pray: Bitter and dull and cold, Her Soul crawl'd back into the common day. Out of the East by night Drew the dark drifting cloud; The air was hushed with snow-flakes wavering white, But the seas below were loud; And out upon the reef the rapid light Rose from a shipwrecked bark Into the dark! Pale stood the fishers, while the wind wail'd by, Till suddenly they started with one cry, And forth into the foam the black boat flew, And fearless to their places leapt the crew. Then one called out, ‘Meg Blane!’ But Meg stood by, and trembled and was dumb, Till, smit unto the heart by sudden pain, Into her hair she thrust her fingers numb, And fell upon the sands, Nor answer'd while the wondering fishers called, But tore the slippery seaweed with her hands, And screamed, and was appalled. For, lo! the Woman's spiritual strength Snapt like a thread at length, And tears, ev'n such as suffering women cry, Fell from her eyes anon; And she knew well, although she knew not why, The charm she had against the deep was gone! And after that dark hour, She was the shadow of a strong Soul dead, All terrible things of power Turned into things of dread, And all the peace of all the world had fled. Then only in still weather did she dare To seek her bread on Ocean, as of old, And oft in tempest time her shelf was bare, Her hearth all black and cold; Then very bitterly, with heart gone wild, She clung about her child, And hated all the earth beneath the skies, Because she saw the hunger in his eyes. For on his mother's strength the witless wight Had leant for guide and light, And food had ever come into his hand, And he had known no thought of suffering; Yea, all his life and breath on sea and land Had been an easy thing. And now there was a change in his sole friend He could not comprehend. Yet slowly to the shade of her distress His nature shaped itself in gentleness! And when he found her weeping, he too wept, And, if she laughed, laughed out in company; Nay, often to the fisher-huts he crept, And begged her bread, and brought it tenderly, Holding it to her mouth, and till she ate Touching no piece, although he hungered sore. And these things were a solace to her fate, But wrung her heart the more. Thus to the bitter dolour of her days In witless mimicry he shaped his ways! They fared but seldom now upon the Sea, But wandered 'mid the marshes hand in hand, Hunting for faggots on the inland lea, Or picking dulse for food upon the strand. Something had made the world more sad and strange, But easily he changëd with the change. For in the very trick of woe he clad His features, and was sad since she was sad, Yea, leant his chin upon his hands like her, Looking at vacancy; and when the Deep Was troublous, and she started up from sleep, He too awoke, with fearful heart astir; And still, the more her bitter tears she shed Upon his neck, marking that mimic-woe, The more in blind deep love he fashionëd His grief to hers, and was contented so. But as a tree inclineth weak and bare Under an unseen weight of wintry air, Beneath her load the weary Woman bent, And, stooping double, waver'd as she went; And the days snow'd their snows upon her head As they went by, And ere a year had fled She felt that she must die. Then like a thing whom very witlessness Maketh indifferent, she lingered on, Not caring to abide with her distress, Not caring to be gone; But gazing with a dull and darkening eye, And seeing Dreams pass by. Not speculating whither she would go, But feeling there was nought she cared to know, And melting even as snow. Save when the man's hand slipped into her own, And flutter'd fondly there, And she would feel her life again, and groan, ‘O God1 when I am gone, how will he fare?’ And for a little time, for Angus' sake, Her hopeless heart would ache, And all life's stir and anguish once again Would swoon across her brain. ‘O bairn, when I am dead, How shall ye keep frae harm? What hand will gie ye bread? What fire will keep ye warm? How shall ye dwell on earth awa' frae me?’— ‘O Mither, dinna dee!’ ‘O bairn, by nigh or day I hear nae sounds ava’, But voices of winds that blaw, And the voices of ghaists that say “Come awa! come awa!” The Lord that made the Wind, and made the Sea, Is sore on my son and me, And I melt in His breath like snaw,'— ‘O Mither, dinna dee! ‘O bairn, it is but closing up the een, And lying down never to rise again. Many a strong man's sleeping hae I seen,— There is nae pain! Im weary, weary, and I scarce ken why; My summer has gone by, And sweet were sleep, but for the sake o' thee.’— ‘O Mither, dinna dee!’ When summer scents and sounds were on the Sea, And all night long the silvern surge plash'd cool, Outside the hut she sat upon a stool, And with thin fingers fashion'd carefully, While Angus leant his head against her knee, A long white dress of wool. ‘O Mither,’ cried the man, ‘what make ye there?’ ‘A blanket for our bed!’ ‘O Mither, it is like the shroud folk wear When they are drown'd and dead!’ And Meg said nought, but kissed him on the lips, And looked with dull eye seaward, where the moon Blacken'd the white sails of the passing ships, Into the Land where she was going soon. And in the reaping-time she lay abed, And by her side the dress unfinishëd, And with dull eyes that knew not even her child She gazed at vacancy and sometimes smiled; And ever her fingers work'd, for in her thought Stitching and stitching, still the dress she wrought; And then a beldame old, with blear-eyed face, For Christ and Charity came to the place, And stilly sewed the woollen shroud herself, And set the salt and candle on a shelf. And like a dumb thing crouching moveless there, Gripping the fingers wan, Marking the face with wild and wondering stare, And whining beast-like, watch'd the witless man. Then like a light upon a headland set, In winds that come from far-off waters blowing, The faint light glimmered—fainter—fainter yet! But suddenly it brighten'd, at its going; And Meg sat up, and, lo! her features wore The stately sweetness they had known of yore; And delicate lines were round her mouth, mild rest Was in her eyes, though they were waxing dim; And when the man crept close unto her breast, She brighten'd kissing him. And it was clear She had heard tidings it was sweet to hear, And had no longer any care or fear. ‘I gang, my bairn, and thou wilt come to me!’ ‘O Mither, dinna dee!’ But as he spake she dropt upon the bed, And darken'd, while the breath came thick and fleet: ‘O Jessie, see they mind my Bairn!’ she said, And quivered,—and was sleeping at God's Feet. When on her breast the plate of salt was laid, And the corse-candle burned with sick blue light, The man crouch'd, fascinated and afraid, Beside her, moaning through the night; And answered not the women who stole near, And would not see nor hear; And when a day and night had come and gone, Ate at the crusts they brought him, gazing on; And when they took her out upon a bier, He followed quietly without a tear; And when on the hard wood fell dust and stone, He murmur'd a thin answer to the sound, And in the end he sat, with a dull moan, Upon the new-made mound. Last, as a dog that mourns a master dead, The man did haunt that grave in dull dumb pain; Creeping away to beg a little bread, Then stealing back again; And only knaves and churls refused to give The gift of bread or meal that he might live— Till pale and piteous-eyed, He moan'd beneath a load too hard to bear. ‘Mither!’ he cried,— And crawled into the Dark, to seek her there. THE BATTLE OF DRUMLIEMOOR. (COVENANT PERIOD.) Bar the door! put out the light, for it gleams across the night, And guides the bloody motion of their feet; Hush the bairn upon thy breast, lest it guide them in their quest, And with water quench the blazing of the peat. Now, Wife, sit still and hark!—hold my hand amid the dark; O Jeanie, we are scattered—e'en as sleet! It was down on Drumliemoor, where it slopes upon the shore, And looks upon the breaking of the bay, In the kirkyard of the dead, where the heather is thrice red With the blood of those asleep beneath the clay; And the Howiesons were there, and the people of Glen Ayr, And we gathered in the gloom o' night—to pray. How! Sit at home in fear, when God's Voice was in mine ear, When the priests of Baal were slaughtering His sheep? Nay! there I took my stand, with my reaphook in my hand, For bloody was the sheaf that I might reap; And the Lord was in His skies, with a thousand dreadful eyes, And His breathing made a trouble on the Deep. Each mortal of the band brought his weapon in his hand, Though the chopper or the spit was all he bare; And not a man but knew the work he had to do, If the Fiend should fall upon us unaware. And our looks were ghastly white, but it was not with affright,— The Lord our God was present to our prayer. Oh, solemn, sad, and slow, rose the stern voice of Monroe, And he curst the curse of Babylon the Whore; We could not see his face, but a gleam was in its place, Like the phosphor of the foam upon the shore; And the eyes of all were dim, as they fixed themselves on him, And the Sea filled up the pauses with its roar. But when, with accents calm, Kilmahoe gave out the psalm, The sweetness of God's Voice upon his tongue, With one voice we praised the Lord of the Fire and of the Sword, And louder than the winter wind it rung; And across the stars on high went the smoke of tempest by, And a vapour roll'd around us as we sung. 'Twas terrible to hear our cry rise deep and clear, Though we could not see the criers of the cry, But we sang and gript our brands, and touched each other's hands, While a thin sleet smote our faces from the sky; And, sudden, strange, and low, hissed the voice of Kilmahoe, ‘Grip your weapons! Wait in silence! They are nigh!’ And heark'ning, with clench'd teeth, we could hear, across the heath, The tramping of the horses as they flew, And no man breathed a breath, but all were still as death. And close together shivering we drew; And deeper round us fell all the eyeless gloom of Hell, And—the Fiend was in among us ere we knew! Then our battle-shriek arose, mid the cursing of our foes— No face of friend or foeman could we mark; But I struck and kept my stand (trusting God to guide my hand), And struck, and struck, and heard the hell-hounds bark; And I fell beneath a horse, but I reached with all my force, And ript him with my reap-hook through the dark. As we struggled, knowing not whose hand was at our throat, Whose blood was spouting warm into our eyes, We felt the thick snow-drift swoop upon us from the lift, And murmur in the pauses of our cries; But, lo! before we wist, rose the curtain of the mist, And the pale Moon shed a glimmer from the skies. O God! it was a sight that made the hair turn white, That wither'd up the heart's blood into woe, To see the faces loom in the dimly lighted gloom, And the butcher'd lying bloodily below; While melting, with no sound, fell so peace-fully around The whiteness and the wonder of the Snow! Ay, and thicker, thicker, poured the pale Silence of the Lord, From the hollow of His hand we saw it shed, And it gather'd round us there, till we groan'd and gasp'd for air, And beneath was ankle-deep and stainèd red; And soon, whatever wight was smitten down in fight Was buried in the drift ere he was dead! Then we beheld at length the troopers in their strength, For faster, faster, faster up they streamed, And their pistols flashing bright showed their faces ashen white, And their blue steel caught the driving Moon, and gleamed. But a dying voice cried, ‘Fly!’ And behold, e'en at the cry, A panic fell upon us, and we screamed! Oh, shrill and awful rose, 'mid the splashing blood and blows, Our scream unto the Lord that let us die; And the Fiend amid us roared his defiance at the Lord, And his servants slew the strong man 'mid his cry; And the Lord kept still in Heaven, and the only answer given Was the white Snow falling, falling, from the sky. Then we fled! the darkness grew! 'mid the driving cold we flew, Each alone, yea, each for those whom he held dear; And I heard upon the wind the thud of hoofs behind, And the scream of those who perish'd in their fear, But I knew by heart each path through the darkness of the strath, And I hid myself all day,—and I am here. Ah! gathered in one fold be the holy men and bold, And beside them the accursed and the proud; The Howiesons are there, and the Wylies of Glen Ayr, Kirkpatrick, and Macdonald, and Macleod. And while the widow groans, lo! God's Hand around their bones His thin ice windeth whitely, as a shroud On mountain and in vale our women will look pale, And palest where the ocean surges boom: Buried 'neath snow-drift white, with no boly prayer or rite, Lie the loved ones they look for in the gloom; And deeper, deeper still, spreads the Snow on vale and hill, And deeper and yet deeper is their Tomb! THE NORTHERN WOOING. Skies are dusky, winds are keen, Round Lallan Farm this Hallowe'en. All is dark across the night, But see! one glimmer of pink light! What are those that in the air Flit against the window-glare? Falling flakes of snow they seem, Or night-moths gather'd by the gleam. Round and round they wind and wind,— Tiny shades against the blind. Child, wish now! while thou canst see! 'Tis the faëry companie! Once a year, on Hallowe'en, Are the faëry people seen. Thus round happy farms they fly, While the peat-fire blazes high. Lad and lass, to-night beware! There is magic in the air! ‘Ah, bairns, my bairns, forbear on Hallow Night To mock the faëry people and their might, For though ye deem these things are all untrue, Yourseives may be the first to see and rue! Hark! now the winds a moment cease to roar, A sound like some one breathing at the door! And hark again! faint pattings on the pane Of little finger-taps, like fluttering rain! Ay! 'tis the faëry people hovering nigh: Draw back the blind to peep, and they will fly! But serve them solemnly, with charm and spell, And the old customs that they love so well, And they will show you all you wish to see,— Your true love's face, his country and degree,— All, all a lass with pleasure asks and learns, Down to the number of her unborn bairns! ‘Ay, please the fays! 'tis easy if ye will; But woe be yours if they should wish you ill: Your jo will take to drink, or drown at sea, Or find another sweeter companie; Your cheeks will droop, your looks will lose their light; Ye'll marry an old man, and freeze at night! In vain, in vain ye try to change your fate, When they have fix'd your lot and future mate: In vain ye seek to frown and turn aside,— They make your heart consent in spite of pride. 'Twas so with me, when I was young and gay, Though I was loth to hearken and obey. They led me to their choice by spells and charms; They closed my een, and drew me to his arms! Or grandfather had ne'er prevailed on me To droop my pride, and smile as low as he! ‘For, though I say it, bairns, my face was fair, And I was Farmer Binnie's child and heir; A widowed father's pet, I ruled the place, Right proud, be sure, of fortune and of face. My hair was golden then, like Maggie's here, And I had een as sly, yet crystal clear, And I could look as bright when pleased and fain, Or toss my curls with just as sweet disdain! What wonder, then, if half the country-side Looked love into my face, and blush'd and cried, Bleating behind me, like a flock of sheep Around a shepherd-lass, who, half asleep, Counts them in play, leads them with pretty speech, Rates all alike, and scarce kens each from each? One found me coy, another found me gleg, Another skittish as the gray mare Meg; Just as the humour took me, I was wild Or gentle,—one day cross, the next day mild; But cared no more for handsome Jamie West, When he came o'er the heather in his best, Jingling his silver spurs at our fire-end, In breeks so tight 'twas near his death to bend, Than for the grim old Laird of Glumlie Glen, Who rode on solemn sheltie now and then Over the moors,—and, making mouths at me, With father cracked of crops o'er barley-bree,— While Jock the groom, who knew I loved such fun, Ginger'd the sheltie for a homeward run! ‘Yet oft I tried to picture in my brain What kind of laddie in the end would gain, And vainly sought 'mong those around to find The substance of the shadow in my mind. But, bairns, in vain I pictured; and anew Will you and children's children picture too:— The bonnie shadow flies, and in its place The chilly substance steals to our embrace. I swore he should be stately, dark, and tall,— His hair was fiery-red and he was small! I swore he should be rich in gold and lands,— His fortune was the strength of his two hands! I swore he should be meek and ruled by me,— The De'il himself is easier led than he!’ Round the happy farm they flee,— Faëry folk in companie. Near the peat-blaze range in ring; Fiddler, twang the fiddle-string. In the great tub duck the head After apples rosy red! Slyly let each pair by turn Watch the magic chestnuts burn! Love who never loved before,— Kiss me quick behind the door! Lad and lass, to-night beware! There is magic in the air! ‘O bairns, we gathered round the blazing peat, And lad and lass sat close and whispered sweet, While ancient women spake of wonders seen On many a long-forgotten Hallowe'en, And old men nodded snowy polls the while, Passing the snuff-box round with sceptic smile. Tall in the midst my father had his place, Health and a golden harvest in his face; And, hand in his, full rosy and full sly, Surrounded by my silly sheep sat I. Loud rang the laughter! fearless grew the fun! Happy and warm at heart was every one! The old, old shepherd, worn with rain and wind, Blink'd in the ingle-nook with eyes half blind, While at his feet his tired old dog slept deep, And, starting, dream'd of gathering the sheep. ‘James West was there, the Laird, and many more, Wooers both old and young, and rich and poor; And, though I say it, bairns, that night I smiled My sweetest, and their wits were fairly wild. Braw with new ribbons in my hair lint-light, Clean as a guinea, newly minted, bright, I sat and hearkened to their silly speech, Happy, and with a careless smile for each; And yet, though some were fine and fair to see, Not one had power to steal my heart from me, ‘Oh, Hallowe'en in those old times, I vow, Was thrice as merry, thrice as sweet, as now! The benches drawn aside, the supper o'er, Fresh sand was strewn upon this very floor; The fiddle played—the fiddler gave a squeal— Up stood the folk, and father led the reel! The lads loup'd up and kick'd the beam for fun! The crimson lassies screamed to see it done! Meantime the old men, with contented look, Smoked clean new cutties in the chimney nook, And thought of days when they were young and gay, And pleased the lassies, too, with feats of play. Yet one was there, my bairns, amid the throng, Who, though his years were young, his limbs full strong, Danced not that night; but pale and gloomy, stayed Among the gaffers, in the chimney shade,— Hugh Scott his name, an orphan lad, whose hand Guided the ploughshare on my father's land, But one my father prized and trusted best For cunning and for skill o'er all the rest. Full well I knew the rogue esteemed me sweet, But I was gentry, and his masters' meat! And oft I smiled on him full fond and free, As ne'er I smiled on those who courted me, Pleased that my smiles sank sweet to his heart's core, But certain he would never hope for more. ‘There in the chimney shadow, pale and sad, Clad in his clothes of Sabbath, sat the lad: In vain, to catch his look, the lassies leered, In vain the old folk saw his sulks, and sneered, But aye his dim and melancholy e'e Turned flashing in the shade and followed me. Whene'er I danced with some fine wooer there, I saw his fist clench and his eyeballs glare,— Red as a rick on fire I watched him grow Whene'er my partner whispered light and low, And had a kiss been stolen in his sight, I swear he would have ta'en revenge in fight. Half pleased, half careless, to increase his ill, I marked him kindly, as a lassie will, And sent him many a smile of tender light To cheer him in his nook, that Hallow night. ‘Louder the fiddler, gay with many a glass, Shouted to stir the hearts of lad and lass! Faster and faster on his strings he skirled! Faster and faster round the dancers whirled! Close by, the young folks duck'd for apples red, Splashing, with puffing cheek and dripping head, Into the washing-bine, or, in a ring, With gaping mouths, they played at cherry-string. But in the parlour, from the turmoil free, Father sat now with antique companie— Cronies who mixed their tumblers strong and deep Twelve times, and toddled, sober, off to sleep. ‘But, bairns, 'twas near the hour when ghaists are said To rise white-sheeted from their kirkyard bed, When the owl calls, and blinks his e'eball white In ruins, where the fairies flit by night. And now my heart beat fast and thick for fear, Because the time of spells and charms was near, And I was bent that very night to fly Out o'er the meadow to the kiln,—and try The twining charm, the spell of fairy fate, And hear the name of him that I should mate.’ Lad and lass, to-night beware! There is magic in the air! Winds are crying shrill, and, hark Ghosts are groaning in the dark. Who will dare this Hallow Night Leave the happy ingle-light? Who will dare to stand alone, While the fairy thread is thrown? Who this night is free from fear? Let her ask,—and she shall hear! ‘Dark, dark was all, as shivering and alone I set my foot upon the threshold-stone, And, trembling close, with twitching fingers caught The great horn-lanthorn from the stables brought, And leant against the door to keep it wide, And peer'd into the solemn gloom, and sighed. Black was the lift, and faintly fell the rain, The wind was screeching like a sprite in pain; And, while I paused, pinching my e'en to mark, The wind swung-to the door, and left me in the dark! ‘O bairns! what would my foolish heart have gi'en To let the fairies be, that Hallowe'en! But I had sworn, and all the lassies knew, And I was shamed, and fain must see it through. Oh! where were all my boasts, my laughter light, Now I was there alone amid the night? While faintly ben the farm the fiddle cried, And far away the sound of dancing died. ‘Thud, thud against my breast my wild heart leapt, As out across the misty yard I crept, Holding the lanthorn up;—its flickering ray Made darkness doubly deep along the way. Then in my ears I seem'd to hear strange screams, And fearful faces flashed with lightning-gleams, And, as I wandered, fingers sharp and wee Pinched me and pulled my garter o'er the knee. Out of the yard, across the field, the dew Still drizzling damply in my face, I flew, Till, breathless, panting hard against the wind, Fearful to look before me or behind, I reached the kiln,—and, standing dizzy there, Heard softer voices round me in the air, A sound like little feet along the gloom, And hummings faint as of a fairy loom. Then setting down the lanthorn on the ground I entered in, nor paused to look around. But faint and fast began to say the charm All northern lassies know, and reached my arm, Casting the twine, and catching one end tight— Flinging the other loose into the night. O bairns! O bairns! scarce had I uttered thrice The secret spell, with lips as cold as ice, When through my blood a sick'ning shudder spread, For ghaistly fingers tighten'd at the thread! Then in a hollow voice, to know my doom, “Who holds? who holds?” I cried into the gloom;— And ere the echo of my voice had died, “Hugh Scott! Hugh Scott!” a hollow voice replied: And, screaming out, and covering up my face, Kicking the lanthorn o'er, I fled the place, Stumbling and tripping, flew across the field, Till, white as any lamb, I reached the bield, And crept up to my room, and hid my head, Moaning, among the blankets of the bed!’ Lightly soon shall rise the sun! Fays, begone! your work is done. Fiddler, put your tools away, Take a nap among the hay. Lads and lassies, flush'd and red, Yawn no more, but off to bed. Maiden, thou hast heard and seen Wonders strange at Hallowe'en. Thou hast wish'd to hear and see— And thy fate is fixed for thee. Sad or merry, ill or well, Fairy looms have spun the spell. In among the blankets creep— Dream about him in your sleep. Wake and smile with heart resigned! Kiss and cuddle, and be kind! ‘Oh, bitter was my heart, my wits amazed; Wildly I pondered like a lassie crazed: Hugh Scott my mate! Hugh Scott, of all around! A pauper lad, a tiller of the ground! When wealthy men came lilting o'er the lea, In shining braws, and sought to marry me! “Nay, nay!” I cried, and frowning raised my face, “No force shall make me choose a lot so base: The spirits of the air but wish this night To try my heart, and fill my soul with fright; Yet they shall know full soon they rate me ill,— I fear them not, nor shall I work their will!” But as I spoke, I shook, and unaware Keek'd o'er my shoulder at the glass, and there, In the faint lamplight burning by the bed, His face, a moment mirror'd, flash'd and fled! ‘O bairns!—what further tale have I to tell? How could I fight against a fate so fell? Strive as I might, awaking or asleep, I found my eyes in fascination deep Follow Hugh Scott, and, till my heart went wild, He haunted me from spot to spot, and smiled. Then, unaware, to notice I began That he was trim and stout, and like a man, That there were tender tones upon his tongue, And that his voice was sweet whene'er he sung. Nay, more, full soon his manners seemed to me More fine than those of loftier degree, And as for gold, though he was humble, still He had a fortune in his farming skill. Ay, bairns! before another Hallow Night The fairies to their wish had worked me quite; And, since his heart had ever favoured Hugh, Full easily they won my father too— And when at last Hugh craved me to be his, I—fell upon his heart and blush'd for bliss! ‘Ah! heed not, bairns, though grand-father should swear That, when I tried the spell, himsel' was there, And, when I saw the phantom in the room, Again, was near me, keeking through the gloom; And that his craft and cunning were the charms Which cheated me and drew me to his arms. Nay! nay! right solemnly, with song and spell, And the old customs that they love so well, Serve the good fays this night—be bold! be brave! And though they may not give you all ye crave, Be sure that you will find, as I have found, Their choice right wise, and all their counsels sound, And bless for many a year the love and light They spin for happy hearts, on Hallow Night.’ AN ENGLISH ECLOGUE. ‘He crept close to Creation's brim, and heard a roar like water.’ TIMOTHY. Well, here's the cuckoo come again, after the barley sowing, Down on the duck-pond in the lane the white-weed is a-blowing, The gorse has got its coat of gold, and smells as sweet as clover, The lady-smocks are blowing bold, the primroses nigh over, On field and fold all things look fair, and lambkins white are leaping, The speckled snakes crawl here and there, —but Holy Tommie's sleeping. JACOB. Ah, him that used to work with Crew! Crewe told me how he blundered. He used to preach. I heard him too. Lord! how he groaned and thundered! The women shrieked like sucking-swine, the men roared out like cattle, But seem'd to think it mighty fine! TIMOTHY. All trash and stuff and tattle! He lost his head through meddling so with things that don't concern us; When questioning too close we go, 'tis little God will learn us; To squeeze the crops 'tis hard enough from His dry ground about us, But sowing t'other world is stuff,—it gets its crops without us! JACOB. That's where it lies! We get no good by asking questions, neighbour: 'Tis Parsons cook our Sunday food, while we are hard at labour: This world needs help upon its way, for men feed one another, And why do we give Parsons pay?—if not to manage t'other? TIMOTHY. You're right! No man as grunts and grides at this here world has thriven; Mutton won't drop in our insides though we do gape at heaven! Why, Tommie's cheek was ruddy red, as rosy as an apple, Till Methodism filled his head, and he was seen at chapel, Found out that he'd received a call, grew dismal, dull, and surly, Read tracts at work, big tracts and small, went praying late and early, And by and by began, poor fool, to argue with the doubting, And though he'd scarcely been to school, began his public spouting. I wasn't blind—and soon I found how he let matters go here,— While he was tilling heavenly ground things suffered down below here: Through want of feed, the hens did die, the horses next grew useless, For lack o' milking by and by the very cows grew juiceless; And when I sought him out, and swore in rage and consternation, Why, Tommie sigh'd, and snivell'd sore, and talk'd about salvation! ‘Salvation's mighty well,’ says I, right mad with my disaster, ‘I want to save my property; so find another master!’ He didn't grumble or resist, though he seemed broken-hearted, But slipped a tract into my fist the morning he departed; Ay, got a place next day with Crewe, who knew the lad was clever, But dawdled as he used to do, and preached as much as ever. JACOB. But Crewe soon sent him packing too—he's just the sort of fellow; Why, ev'n when Parson calls, old Crewe grunts, grumbles, and looks yellow! TIMOTHY. He got another master, though, but soon began to tire him; His wages sank and sank, and so no farmer here would hire him; And soon, between that world and this, poor Tommie grew more mournful, His worldly ways went all amiss—the country folk looked scornful— And last the blessed Methodists grew tired, and would not hear him, And wouldn't heed his talk inspired, and shrank from sitting near him. JACOB. With Methodists 'tis just the way. Give me the High Church, neighbour. TIMOTHY. ‘Why don't you be a man?’ said they, ‘keep clean and do your labour?’ And what d'ye think that Tommie cried?— ‘I don't play shilly-shally; If I'm to serve my Lord and Guide, 'twill be continuälly: You think that you can cheat and scoff from Sunday on to Sunday, And put the Lord Almighty off by howling out on one day; But if you seek salvation, know, your feelings must be stronger.’ And holy Tommie would not go to chapel any longer. Learned sense? Not he! Reformed? Pooh, pooh! but moped and fretted blindly, Because the precious praying crew had used him so unkindly. His back grew bare, his life grew sore, his brain grew dreadful airy, He thought of t'other world the more 'cause this seemed so contrary; Went wandering on the river-side, and in the woods lay lurking, Gaped at the sky in summer-tide when other men were working, And once (I saw him) watch'd the skies, where a wild lark was winging, With tears a-shining in his eyes,—because the lark was singing! Last harvest-time to me he came, and begged for work so sadly, Show'd for his former ways such shame, and look'd so sick and badly, I had not heart to give him pain, but put him out a-reaping, But, Lord! the same tale o'er again—he worked like one half-sleeping. ‘Be off!’ says I, ‘you lazy lout,’ and all the rest stood sneering. ‘Master,’ says he, ‘you're right, I doubt,— the Lord seems hard o' hearing! I thought I could fulfil full clear the call that I had gotten, But here's another harvest here, and all my life seems rotten. The Methodists are dull as stone, the High Church folk are lazy, And even when I pray alone, the ways of Heaven seem hazy. Religion don't appear to me to keep a lad from sad things, And though the world is fine to see, 'tis full of cruel bad things. Why, I can't walk in woodland ways, and see the flowers a-growing, And on the light green meadows gaze, or watch the river flowing, But even here, where things look fine, out creeps the speckled adder, Or snakes crawl in the golden shine, and all creation's sadder. The better I have seemed to grow, the worse all things have gone with me, It beats me out and out, and so—I wish the Lord was done with me!’ And after these same words were said, Tommie grew paler, stiller, And by and by he took to bed, and quickly he grew iller: And when the early new-year rain was yellowing pool and river, He closed his eyes, and slipt his chain, and fell to sleep for ever. JACOB. 'Tis clear enough, he'd lost his wit—the chapel set it turning. TIMOTHY. Now, this is how I look at it, although I've got no learning: In this here world, to do like him is nothing but self-slaughter,— He crept close to Creation's brim, and heard a roar like water, His head went round, his limbs grew stiff, his blood lost life and motion,— Like one who stands upon a cliff and sees the roaring Ocean. . . . But there's the Parson at his gate, with Doctor Barth, his crony; Some of these days the old chap's weight will kill that precious pony! Ah, he's the man whose words don't fail to keep one sage and steady! Wife, here be Parson! Draw some ale, and set the table ready. A SCOTTISH ECLOGUE. ‘The Lord on him forgot to put His mark.’ SANDIE. O Lord above, swift is Thy wrath and deep! And yet by grace Thou sanctionest Thy sheep; And blest are they who till the day o' doom Like haddocks bear the marking of Thy thoomb; And curst, in spite of works and prayers, are they On whom Thy mark has ne'er been printed sae. For while the non-elected lie beneath, And fast in flaming fire, and gnash their teeth, Above their heads, where streams of honey spring, Thine Elders stand in shining sarks, and sing, Blessing Thy Name for present gifts and past . . . O wife, John Galloway is gone, at last! JEANIE. Dead? Weel, we all are bound to God's abode, And John has started first upon the road. A Christian man and kind was John, indeed, And free of siller unto folk in need: Ay, many a hearth will want now John is cold! But God will give him back his gifts tenfold. SANDIE. O Jeanie Gourlay! keep thy clapper still; It talks o' things you understand but ill: I doubt, I sorely doubt, John Galloway Is 'neath the oxter Armpit. o' the De'il this day! True, in the way of sinful flesh, his mind Was charitable, and his heart was kind; But Light he lacked as long as he drew breath, And lost the Eldership before his death; And he had many a ghostly whispering To tell he was a miserable thing, Doom'd by the Wisdom of the Just to be Condemn'd with those who graceless live and dee. Ay, grace, I fear, John Galloway was denied, Though loud and oft for grace he groaned and cried. ‘Sandie,’ he used to say, ‘I fear, I fear I have no right among the holy here; I fear, I fear that I am in the dark— The Lord on me forgot to put His mark! I canna steel my heart to folk who sin, I canna put my thoughts to discipline; Oft when I pray, I hear Him whisper plain, “Jock Galloway, pray awa', but 'tis in vain;”— Nae sweet assurance arms me 'gainst the De'il, Nae happy faith, like that my fellows feel; I long for God, I beg Him on my knee, But fear He hath to wrath prevision'd me!’ JEANIE. Poor man! his strife was sore; but, Sandie, mind, Nae man can tell what folks are predestined; Ev'n Sandie Gourlay may be one the De'il Hath liberty to catch within his creel! SANDIE. Oh, blasphemy! Thou fool, forbear and cease! The sign o' grace is perfect faith and peace, Such as the Lord, in spite o' many a cross, Vouchsafes to men like me and neighbour Ross. But Galloway ever was a braxie sheep, A whining thing who dug his doubts too deep. Why, mind ye, when old Robin Caird himsel'— A heretic, a rogue, a man o' Bel, Averring written Scripture was a lee, And doubting God, stretch'd out his limbs to dee, John by the sinner knelt and offered prayers: ‘Lord God,’ he said, ‘pity his old white hairs! Be kind unto him! Take him unto Thee!’ And bought the coffin, paid the burial fee. ‘Sandie,’ he said, when Caird was in his grave, ‘I doubt I am less holy than the lave: The rest. My blood is water, I am weak o' brain,— O Lord, it broke my heart to see his pain! I thought—I dared to think—if I were God, Poor Caird should never gang so dark a road; I thought—ay, dared to think, the Lord forgi'e!— The Lord was crueller than I could be; Forgetting God is just, and knoweth best What folk should burn in fire, what folk be blest.’ Such was his nature, neither strong nor deep,— Unlike the stern strong shepherds of His sheep. We made an Elder of John Galloway! Large seemed his heart, he ne'er was known to stray; But he had little strength or wrath severe— He soften'd at the sinful pauper's tear; He push'd his purse and pleaded like a fool For every lassie on the cuttie-stool. JEANIE. Where had the parish bairns sae kind a friend? SANDIE. Bairns? did he teach them grace, and make them mend? At Sunday School what lad or lass had care For fear of flaming Hell, if John was there,— Questioning blushing brats upon his knees, And slyly slipping in their hands—bawbees? Halfpence. Once while he talked to me o' life and death, I smelt the smell o' whisky in his breath. ‘Drinking again, John Galloway?’ I said; As gray as this pipe-reek, he hung his head. ‘O Sandie, Sandie!’ he replied, ‘I ken I am indeed the weakest man of men. Strange doubts torment me daily, and, alas! I try to drown them in the poison'd glass. By fits I fear, and in my soul I say, Lord, is Thy mark on poor John Gallo-way? And sorely troubled, stealing slyly out, I try in drink to drown the imp o' Doubt.’ Woman, is this the man ye would defend? Nay, wheesht awhile, and hearken to his end. When he fell sick in Martinmas, his fears Grew deeper far; I found him oft in tears; Though from the Prophets of God's wrath I read, He hearken'd, but was little comforted, And even ‘Revelations’ had no power To soothe the pangs of his departing hour. A week before he left this vale of woe, He at his window sat, and watched the Snow Falling and falling down without a sound, Poured slowly from God's hand upon the ground: ‘See, Sandie, how it snaws!’ I heard him say; ‘How many folk are cold, cold, cold this day! How many want the fire that's warming me! How many starve!—and yet—why should it be?’ And when I took the Book, explained, and read, He only gave a groan and shook his head. ‘Clearer and clearer I perceive my sin, How I to grace may never enter in; That Book is for the strong, but I am weak,’ And trembled, and a tear was on his cheek. JEANIE. Poor man! poor man! small peace on earth he found. SANDIE. The day he died, he called the Elders round, Shook hands, and said, ‘Friends, though I gang from here, Down under earth, all will at last be clear. Too long have I been dwelling in the dark, The Lord on me forgot to put His mark, God help me!’ And, till he was cold as clay, His foolish lips had little more to say; Yet after we had laid him down in dust, Weak to the last we found him, and unjust; For when his will was read, unto our shame, No holy man was mentioned in the same! But he had left what little gold he had To Caird's sick widow and her lass and lad! THE SCAITH O' BARTLE. Fathoms deep the ship doth lie, Wreath'd with ocean weed and shell, Still and deep the shadows lie, Dusky as a forest dell: Tangled in the twisted sail, With the breathing of the Sea, Stirs the Man who told this tale, Staring upward dreamilie. I laid him here, and scarcely wept; but look! His grave is green and wild and like a wave, And strewn with ocean-shells instead of flowers. You saw him long ago, on board the Erne, Cod-fishing in Newfoundland, and (you mind?) We drank a gill, all three, the very day Before the Erne went down off Fitful Head, And all the crew were drown'd but brother Dan. Strange, that a man who faced so many a storm, And stood on splitting planks and never quail'd, And swam to save his life a dozen times, Should ever die ashore! Why, from the first, We twins were meant for sailors:—God Himself Planted a breeze in both our brains to blow Our bodies up and down His calms and storms. Never had wilder, stormier year been known Here in the clachan, than the very year When Dan and I were born;—waters and winds Roar'd through the wintry season, and the sounds And sights weigh'd on our Highland mother's heart, Giving her whims and moods in which the clay Beneath her heart was fashion'd; and in March The Scaith came down the valley, screaming past Her ears the very hour that we were born. When other boys were mumping at the school, I went as cabin-lad on board a whaler, And Dan took up his canvas-bag, tied up His serk and comb and brush, with two or three Big home-baked bannocks and a lump of cheese, Kiss'd mother, (that's her grave beside his own,) And walk'd to Aberdeen, where soon he found A berth on board a brig—the Jessie Gray, Bound south for Cadiz. After that for years We drifted up and down;—and when we met Down in the Forth, and journey'd home together, We both were twenty, Dan was poor as ever, But I had saved. How changed he look'd! how fine! Brown cheek and bit o' whisker, hands like steel, A build as sturdy as a mountain fir's,— Ay, every inch a sailor! Then, the tales We had for one another!—tales of storms And sights on land, pranks play'd and places seen!— But, ‘Bob, I'm tired of being on the seas, The life's a hard one at the best,’ says Dan; And I was like a fool and thought the same. So home we came, found father dead and gone, And mother sorely push'd; and round her neck We threw our arms, and kiss'd her, and she cried, And we cried too, and I took out my pay And pour'd it in her lap; but Dan look'd grieved, And, glancing from the pay to mother, cried, ‘I'll never, never go to sea again!’ 'Tis thirty years ago, and yet right well I mind it all. How pleasant for a time Was life on land: the tousling with the girls, The merry-making in the public-house, The cosy bed on winter nights. We work'd— I at the fishing, Dan at making nets— And kept old mother for a year and more. But ere the year was out, the life grew dull: We never heard the wind blow, but we thought Of sailing on the sea,—we got a knack Of lying on the beach and listening To the great waters. Still, for mother's sake, Ashore we had to tarry. By and by, The restlessness grew worse, and show'd itself In other ways,—taking a drop too much, Fighting and cutty-stooling—and the folk Began to shake their heads. Amid it all, One night when Dan was reading out God's Book, (That bit about the Storm, where Peter tries To walk on water, and begins to sink,) Old mother sigh'd and seem'd to go to sleep, And when we tried to wake her, she was dead. With sore, sore hearts we laid poor mother down; And walk'd that day up yonder cliffs, and lay A hearkening to the Sea that wash'd beneath: Far, far away we saw a sail gleam wet Out of a rainy spot below the line Where sky and water meet; the Deep was calm, And overhead went clouds whose shadows floated Slowly beneath, and here and there were places Purple and green and blue, and close to land The red-sail'd fish-boats in a violet patch. I look'd at brother Dan, Dan look'd at me,— And that same morning, off we went again! No rest for us on land from that day forth. We grew to love the waters; they became Part of our flesh and blood; the Sea, the Sea, The busy whistling round the foam-girt world, Was all our pleasure. Now and then we met,— Once in a year or two, and never came To Scotland but we took a journey here To look on mother's grave, and spend a day With old companions. But we never thought Of resting long, and never hoped to die Ashore, like mother: we had fix'd it, Jack, That we must drown some day. At last, by luck, We ran together. Dan had got a place As captain of a brig, and, press'd by him, They made me mate. Ten years we sail'd together, From Liverpool to New South Wales and back; And we were lads no more, but staid, strong men, Forty and upward,—yet with kibble arms, Brown cheeks, and cheerful hearts. Then the ill wind That blows no good to anyone began, And brought us back to Scotland, to this place Where we were born and bred. Now, mark you, Jack, Even a sailor is but flesh and blood, Though out upon the water he can laugh At women and their ways; a run on shore, A splash among the dawties and the drink, Soon tires, soon tires—then hey! away again To the wild life that's worthy of a man! At forty, though, a sailor should be wise, And 'ware temptation: whole a sailor, free, But only half a sailor, though afloat, When wedded. Don't you guess? Though Dan was old, His head was turn'd, while in the clachan here, And by a woman,—Effie Paterson, The daughter of a farmer on the hills, And only twenty. Bonnie, say you? Ay: As sweet a pout as ever grew on land; But soft and tender, with a quiet face That needed the warm hearth to light it up, And went snow-pallid at a puff of wind Or whiff of danger. When I saw the trap, I tried my best to wheedle Dan away, Back to the brig; but, red as ricks on fire, He glinted with those angry eyes of his, And linger'd. Then, 'twas nearly time to sail; I talk'd of going, and it all came out: He meant to marry, Jack!—and not content With marrying, he meant to stop ashore! Why, if a lightning flash had split our craft, I should have wonder'd less. But, ‘Bob,’ says he, ‘I love this lassie as I never thought 'Twas in my heart to love; and I have saved; And I am tired of drifting here and there On yonder waters: I have earn'd my rest, And mean to stop ashore until I die.’ 'Twas little use to argue things with Dan When he had settled aught within his mind; So all I said was vain. What could I do But put a sunny face upon it all, And bid him hasten on the day, that I Might see his wedding, and be off again? Yet soon I guess'd, before the wedding day, That Effie did not care a cheep for Dan, But scunner'd at his brave rough ways and tales Of danger on the deep. His was a voice Meant for the winds, with little power to whisper The soft sleek things that make the women blush, And tingle, and look sweet. Moreover, Dan Was forty, and the lassie but a child. I saw it all, but dared not speak my thought! For Dan had money, Effie's folks were poor, And Dan was blind, and Effie gave consent, And talk was no avail. The wedding guests Went up to Effie's home one pleasant day, The minister dropp'd in, the kirk-bells rang, And all was over. 'Twas a summer morn, The blue above was fleck'd with feathery down, The Sea was smooth, and peaceful, and the kirk Stood mossy here upon the little hill, And seem'd to smile a blessing over all. And Effie? Ah! keep me from women, Jack! Give them a bit o' sunshine—and they smile, Give them a bit o' darkness—and they weep; But smiles and tears with them are easy things, And cheat ye like the winds. On such a day, With everybody happy roundabout, Effie look'd happy too; and if her face Flush'd and was fearful, that was only joy; For when a woman blushes, who can tell Whether the cause be gladness, pride, or shame? And Dan (God bless him!) look'd as young as you, Trembled and redden'd lass-like, and I swear, Had he not been a sailor, would have cried. So I was cheer'd, next day, when off I went To take his post as captain of the brig, And I forgot my fears, and thought them wrong, And went across the seas with easy heart, Thinking I left a happy man behind. But often, out at sea, I thought of Dan, Wonder'd if he was happy. When the nights Were quiet, still, and peaceful, I would lie And listen to the washing of the waves, And think: ‘I wonder if this very light Is dropping far away on poor old Dan? And if his face looks happy in it, while He sleeps by Effie's side?’ On windy nights I used to think of Dan with trouble and fear; And often, when the waves were mountains high, And we were lying-to before the wind, The screaming surges seem'd to take the shape Of this old clachan, and I seem'd to hear Dan calling me; and I would drink the salt, And pace the deck with all my blood on fire, Thinking—‘If Dan were driving on out here, Dashing and weather-beaten, never still, He would be happier!’ Ay! though the Storm Roll'd on between us, voices came from Dan To tell me he was lonely on the land. Often, when I was sailing in the ship, He crept about these caves and watch'd the Moon Silv'ring the windless places of the sea, And thought of me! or on the beach he lay, And wearied to the breaking of the waves! Or out from land he row'd his boat, and gazed Wistfully eastward! or on windy nights He speel'd yon cliffs above the shore, and set His teeth together in the rain and wind, Straining eyes seaward, seeking lights at sea, And pacing up and down upon the brink As if he trode the decks! Why, things like those Saved him from sinking, salted all his blood, And soothed his heartache. Wind and wave are far More merciful than a young woman's heart! Why, had she been a bickering hizzie, fill'd With fire and temper, stubborn as a whin, And cushlingmushling o'er a cheerless fire, Dan might have brought her round: that was the work He understood full well; and, right or wrong, He would have been the Skipper to the end. But though a man who has been train'd at sea, Holding a hard strong grip on desperate men, Can sink his voice and play a gentle part In sunny seasons, he has little power To fight with women's weapons. Dan, be sure, Loved Effie with a love the deeper far And tenderer because he had been bred On the rough brine; but when, from day to day, He met a weary and a waning face, That tried to smile, indeed, but could not smile, And saw the tears where never tears should be, Yet never met an angry look or word, What could he do? He loved the lass too well To scold; tried soothing words, but they were spent Upon a heart where the cold crancreuch grew; And, when the sorrow grew too sharp to bear, Stole sicken'd from the dwelling. Plain he saw The lass was dreary, though she kept so still, And loved him not, though nothing harsh was said, But fretted, and grew thin, and haunted him With a pale face of gentleness and grief. O Jack, Jack, Jack! of all the things accurst, Worse than a tempest and the rocks ahead, Is misty weather, not a breath of wind, And the low moaning of some unseen shore! Homeless and sad and troubled by her face, If Dan had let his heart and brain keep still, Let the sick mildew settle on his soul, He would have shrunk into a wretched thing The rains might beat on, and the winds might lash, And ne'er have had the heart to stand erect, And set his teeth, and face them, and subdue. What could he do, but try to ease his heart By haunting yonder beach, and glorying In stormy seasons, thinking of the life He used to lead, with ocean-sound for ever Making a second life within his blood, Thinking of me, and feeling that his soul Was soothed a bit by his old friend the Sea? And Effie, as the dawn look'd down each day, Turn'd from the happy shining of the sun, In wanrest and in tears; and poor old Dan Dree'd bitterly the dreary life on land. No stanchgrass ever heal'd a wound so deep! 'Twas comfort dwelling in so wild a place, So near to open water; but for that, I do not think he could have borne to dwell Pining ashore. His trouble grew and grew: No corsy-belly warm'd at Effie's fire, No doctor's watch tick'd by the jizzen-bed, No sound of tiny footfalls fill'd the house With happy cheer; the dull and lifeless mood Grew on the wife; her sense of shame seem'd gone; She paid no heed to dress, or to the house, But faded, like a pale-faced, listless flower, Grown in a weedy garden. Then, indeed, To see all household goods neglected so, The crowsfeet gathering round Effie's eyes, The ingleside so cheerless and so cold, Dan clench'd his fists, and storm'd with thunder-voice; But Effie only trembled, and was still, Or threw her apron o'er her face and wept; And Dan, who never in his life could bear To see a woman weep, pleaded and begg'd,— Without avail. Then many and many a night He roam'd the silent cliffs till peep of day, Or join'd the fishers, out upon the sea; And many and many a night he thought he heard My voice a-calling him. One night of storm, When the sky murmur'd, and the foam-fleck'd sea Flash'd in the fireflaught round the shadowy cliffs, He fix'd to run away;—but could not go, Until he gazed on Effie's face once more; And when he stole into her room unheard, He saw her sleeping with a happy smile, So still, so sweet, so bonnie in her dream, So like the shining lass she used to be, That his heart sank, he swaver'd forth again, And lay upon the waterside and wept, And tho' the wind was whistling in his eyes, Tho' the still fireflaught flash'd upon the foam, He felt too weak, too timid, and too sad, To quit her in the little cottage here, And dree again the dangers of the deep. The house is yonder—ay, the slated house, With little patch of garden. Mark the pool Of water at the door. Beyond you see The line of boats, drawn high and dry, and yonder The dull, green water, with the purple stain Out eastward, and the sunlight slanting through Upon a sail. Mark how the clachan lies Down in the gully, with the barren hills, Where never ran-tree waves its silver hair, On either side. Look backward, now! The glen, Hollow'd between the hills, goes inland, far As eye can see—with yellow pools of rain, And cattle looking shadowy in the mists Upon the slopes. How still and dull looks all! 'Tis plain you gather, with a sailor's eye, The danger. When the rains have lasted long, The yellow Waters (rightly christen'd here The Scaith o' Bartle) gather up the glen, Suck in the strength of flying mist and cloud, And, bursting from the hollows where they meet, Rush seaward, with a roaring like the sea, O'erwhelming all. Thrice has the mischief come In one-and-twenty years. When I came home, A month ago, and walk'd across the hills From Cardy town, I paused on yonder cliffs, And saw the clachan lying at my feet,— The setting sun shining upon the house Where Dan was dwelling. Nought was alter'd there! The very smacks and fish-boats just the same As when I quitted. While I stood and gazed, I saw a stooping figure with a staff, Standing hard by me on the cliffs, and gazing Silently seaward. As I look'd, he turn'd, And though the face was haggard, worn, and old, And every hair upon the head was gray, And the fresh life about the limbs was lost, I knew old Dan, and, shouting blithely, ran To hug him to my heart; and he turn'd white, Shaking like straw in wind, to find 'twas me. Then, when the shock was over, and we talk'd, He brighten'd,—as an icicle turns bright When shone on. But my heart was shock'd and sore! He was the ghost of what he once had been; His voice was broken, and his welcome seem'd Like one's who, sinking on his pillow, smiles To see a face he loves before he dies; And when his air grew cheerier, and at last His love for me came lighter on his look, His cheeriness seem'd sadder far than all. Swavering down the path, he took my arm, Leant heavily on his staff, as if he dream'd, Talk'd of old times, and friends alive and dead, Until we halted at his cottage door; And, while he lifted up the latch, he cast His eyes to windward, read the weather signs, After old habit, ere he enter'd in. Effie was there,—changed too; she welcomed me, Moved but and ben the house with a light step, And smiled a bit:—all women have a smile, A happiness, a kind of second self, Kept for fresh faces. Yet I saw full soon The bield was homeless; little love was there; Ah, that was common talk aroundabout! The first flush faded soon from Effie's face, Leaving it dull and wan; she moved about Like a sick lassie risen from a dream; And oft, when we were seated in the lowe, She started, and her colour went and came; And though her features wore a kind of fear, There was a light of youth there: she would keek At Dan, whose eyes were fix'd upon the fire, Hang o'er her knitting, breathing deep, and then Hearken and hearken, till the soft bright blush Died by degrees, her face became composed To pallor, and the light had gone away, Leaving her sick and soopit once again. At last, when we were smoking in the bield One dull day in November, Dan arose And took his stick, and, beckoning me, went out: I follow'd; and he never spake a word, But gript me by the arm, and walk'd along, Until we left the clachan far behind, And took a pathway winding up the hills. For many weeks, at intervals, the rain Had fallen; and the hills were dreeping damp, And down their sides ran many streams new-born, Making an eerie murmur. Far away Ben Callachan was glimmering through a mist, And all round Bartle rose a vaporous steam Silent and white, with cattle here and there Dismally looming. Still and dull was all— So still, so chill; only the faint sharp stir That is a sound, but seems a click within The ear itself;—save when from far away A cow would low, and echoes faint and far Died inland, or when, blowing on the wind, A cry came from the sea, whose waves we saw Beyond us, breaking in a shadowy cloud, With gleams of glittering foam. But Dan walk'd on, Scarce heeding ought; and yet his sailor's eye Took in the signs, and glinted up and down With the old cunning; but his heart was full, His voice was broken like a weeping wean's, And as we went along he told me all. All that you guess! but somewhat more —a thought Of later growth, a nettle in his heart— That Effie was not true, as wives should be; And that her fairest thoughts were fallen things That clung around a fresh young lover's knees. I stared at Dan, and hearken'd in amaze! His grip was tight upon my arm, his face White as the snow on Callachan, his voice Shrill as a sea-gull's shriek; and all at once He waved his arms, turn'd his wild face away, And cried aloud with a full heart—‘O God! Why did I ever cease to sail the Sea?’ I tried to argue with him—he was dumb! And yet I saw, had I been daft enough To echo him, he would have hated me. He only half believed the things he said, And would have turn'd in wrath on any man Who could believe them true, and say the same. He loved the braxie still, as few can love. Save the Good Shepherd, who has love for all! Could not have tholed to hear another's thoughts Condemn her! blamed himself for all his grief! And gladly would have died beneath her feet, To win one word, one kiss, one shining look, To show his love had not been quite in vain! But on we fared, so fill'd with our own thoughts, We scarcely saw how far away we wander'd, How mirk all grew, how close the gathering clouds Drew to the hill-tops, while the cattle raised Their heads into the dismal air and cried. Then, suddenly, there came a lightning gleam That for a moment lighted up the hills, The far off cliffs, and the far flash of foam, And faded,—to a sound as if the earth And heavens were torn asunder. Soon the storm Deepen'd—the thunder and the lightning came Ofter than dark or silence; and I felt Far less myself on those dull endless heights, Than seeing, hearing, from my ship at sea. But Dan said little; only, as the drops Of rain began to fall, he led the way Into a mountain shieling, roof'd with turfs, Where we in shelter crouch'd, and still talk'd on Of his dull ingleside, his darken'd days, The terror and the pain he had to dree. And ‘All I care for now is ended, Bob! I want to die, but not to leave the lass Untended and unhappy. After all, I cannot blame her for her crancreuch face,— She is so young—mid-eild is past with me— Be sure that she would love me if she could!’ And then he glower'd out on the dark, and groan'd, ‘Would I were in my grave!—would I were doom'd Among the waves!—would I were far out yonder, Praying and sinking in a boat at sea!’ And I was silent; but the elements Made answer. With a clash like iron fell The headlong torrent of the soot-black clouds, Drowning the thunders with its dreesome cry, Birming above, around, and smiting earth With strength of stone. Never for many a year Had such a fall been known: it seem'd the Lord Unlocking all His waters to destroy The bad world o'er again. No rainbow there To promise sunshine and a speedy end! For 'twas the Black Rain, which had once or twice Gone southward, making frighted Elders groan, And which old wives in Bartle often call The ‘Deil's rain,’ thinking Satan flies him-self, Dropping the dreadful blackness from above. Silent we waited, watching, and the air Was full of a great roar—the sods beneath Seem'd shaking—and the rain-wash forced a way Through the thick turf above our heads, and fell Upon us, splashing, as with watery ink, Our hands and faces. But I saw Dan's eye Had kindled. He was younger. For the sounds Quicken'd his sense of life, brought up his strength, And minded him of former fearsome days Upon the Ocean; and his other self— The sickly self that lived the life on land— Forsook him. Then there was a lull, a pause— Not broken by the further fall of rain, Nor by the thunder-claps, but by a sign More terrible than all—a roar, a groan, A motion as of waters, and a sound Like the dread surging of an angry Sea. And Dan threw up his arms, screaming aloud, ‘The Scaith! the Scaith!’—and groan'd, and rush'd away,— I following close behind him in the mirk. And on he tore, until he gain'd a craig, Above the glen, yonder between the hills; And cattle huddled round him, lowing loud, And the Scaith thicken'd, and the murmur grew, While we gazed down. The mists hung round the heights, The rain still fell, but faintly,—and below, Roaring on seaward, snatching in its course Boulders and trees and cattle, rush'd the Scaith, A blacken'd yellow wash of waters, foaming Where'er it touched the feet of stone or steep, And dizzily whirling round the great tree-roots To twist them from their beds. White, scared, and stunn'd, Dan groan'd, and sank upon his knees, and sobbed. Done was the thunder; but the waters made Another thunder, and the fireflaught came Fainter and fainter. Then we heard from far A sound more awful—shrieks of living men, Children and women; while the thinning clouds Parted to westward, brightening at the rims, And rays of misty sunset slanted down On Bartle, and the Scaith had seized its prey. ‘Effie!’ cried Dan; and sped along the hills, And would have rush'd right downward to his death Had I not gript him. But we found a way O'er the hillside, and gain'd the northern height Above the clachan. Jack, until I die, That hour will haunt me! For the village lay Naip-deep beneath the moaning rain-dyed flood, And bields sank shatter'd, and the sunset cold Gleam'd upon Bartle and the sea beyond; And on the slopes on either side there gather'd Women and men: some screeching as they saw The Scaith drink up their houses and their goods, Some crying for the friends they could not see, Some sitting still, and looking on their bairns, As if they had gone wild. Then Dan glared round, Seeking for Effie,—but he saw her not; And the damp sunset gleaming on his face, Grimed with the rain-drops, show'd it ghastly pale, But he was cool as he had often been On gruesome nights at sea. ‘She is not here!’ He whispered; ‘yet she cannot but be saved. Perchance she gathers with the folk that stand Waving their arms yonder across the flood: Oh! would my eyes were young that I might see.’ That way I gazed; but all that I could see Were mists beyond the clachan; down below, The wildly washing waters; here and there, Women and children screaming on the roofs, While punts and skiffs were gliding here and there, Piloting slowly through the rocks and walls, To succour those unsaved; at intervals A leafless tree-top peering through the water, While frighted birds lit on its twigs, or wheel'd Around it crying. Then, ‘A boat! a boat!’ Dan cried; but he was crying to the air: The folk around him heard and made a stir,— But some scarce raised their wild and watery eyes, And some stopp'd moaning, look'd at him who cried, And then again sat rocking to and fro, Gazing straight downward, and with eerie groans Bewailing their own sorrow. Then the place Blacken'd in gloaming—mists rose from the flood— The sky turn'd black, with neither stars nor moon, And down below, flashing from place to place, The lights, like corpse-lights warning folk of death, Flitted and faded, showing where the boats Still moved about upon their weary work And those who grieved were stiller all around; The solemn moaning of the Scaith was hush'd, Your ears could hear the sobbing of the Sea; And only now and then a hollow splash Spake plain of walls that yielded and slipt down Into the waters. Then a light came near, And to the water's edge a fishing-boat Brought a dead fisher, and a little child Who cried for ‘mither’; and as he who row'd Handed the bairn to hungry outstretch'd arms, And landed with the corpse, old Dan leapt in, Snatching the lanthorn from the fisher's hand, Push'd off ere I could follow, and had flown Into the darkness . . . Jack,—I never again Saw poor old Dan, alive! Yet it was well His woes were ended; for that very day, Ere the Scaith came, Effie had crept from home,— Ay, with a man;—and ere I knew the truth Why, she was out upon the ocean waves, And fleeing with the loon to Canada. Ill winds pursue her! God will find her out! He sent His water down to free old Dan, And He is after her across the Deep! Next dawning, when the Scaith was part subdued, And sinking slowly through the seams of earth, Pouring in bright brown burns to join the sea, Fouling with mud the line of breaking foam, 'Twas a most piteous sight to see the folk, With spade and mattock, digging at the graves Of their own dwellings; taking what was saved With bitter thankless faces. Fallen walls, And trees uprooted from the waste hillsides, And boulders swept from far along the glen, And household lumber gather'd everywhere, Mingled in ruin; and the frailer bields Were swept away for ever. As for me, I had my work in hand. I took a spade And waded through the thick and muddy pools, ('Twas still waist-deep,) right onward to the place Where Dan had dwelt. For something drew me there, Foremost of all. The bield was standing still, Though doors and windows had been beaten in; And as I splash'd along the passage, bits Of household lumber tripped me; but I went Right on to Effie's room, and there the flood Was lying black and cold;—and there lay Dan. Washing upon the water, with his face Drawn downward, his hands clench'd, his long gray hair Rippling around him—stiff, and cold, and dead And when I turn'd his face up to the light, I did not scunner much—it look'd so strong, So seaman-like, and fine. I saw it all! How he had drifted thither in the dark, And found the water low around the bield, But slowly rising; how he fought his way, Search'd but and ben, and last, in Effie's room, Stood ghastly in the lanthorn light, and saw The place was empty; how, while there he stood, Staring in horror, with an eldritch cry The wild Scaith struck the crashing window panes, Dash'd down the lanthorn, gript him in the dark, Roar'd in his ears, and while it struck him down, Out of his nostrils suck'd the breath of life. Jack, Jack, we know there comes to men who drown A sudden flashing picture of the past,— And ah! how pitiful, how pitiful, In that last minute did the picture come: A vision of the sounding Sea afar, A ghaistly ship upon it,—Effie's face, Coming and going like to floating foam,— The picture of the kirk upon the hill, And sunshine smiling on the wedding guests,— The shadowy cliffs where he had paced in pain, The waves, the sun, the moon, the thought of me, All thicken'd on him as he scream'd her name, And struggled with the cruel Scaith, and died! Ay! God Almighty's water, e'en ashore, More merciful than women, found him out; And here he lies, but should have lain else-where. Had Scots law, and the blethering women's tongues, Not hinder'd me,—I would have ta'en a boat, And sewn his body in a sheet, with stones Fasten'd beneath his soles to sink him down, And row'd out yonder, westward, where the sun Dips red beneath the straight blue water line, Then said a prayer, and softly sent him down Where he could sleep in peace, and hear for ever The washing of the waters through the depths: With flag-flowers o'er his head, great weeds all round, And white salt foam-bells hanging in his ears, His would have been a sailor's sleep indeed! But as it is, he slumbers here on land, In shade of Bartle Kirk, 'mong country loons And fishermen that shrink at open Sea. THE GLAMOUR. The hills close round her—everywhere Strange voices deepen in the air; The pain, the hope, the agony, Flash to a sense of mystery; The shapes of earth and air and skies Catch glamour in her weary eyes; Worn with the pain, worn with the pain, She would lie down, and sleep again! O Lord my God, draw not Thy hand away— The sleep-stoure fills my eyes—I feel my grave— And I would reach a painless end, like those Thy glamour ne'er hath troubled. I have been O'er long a shadow on the paths of men, O'er long a screeching bird in happy bields, O'er long a haunted wanderer day and night. Lord, let me die! Lord, let me die! Lord God, Pity and spare me! Draw Thy hand away! Thy breath is on me in the mirk, and ah! I sicken sore, while yonder through the pane Corpse-candles, blowing blue against the wind, Flit slowly to the kirkyard, down Glen-Earn. What had I done, that Thou shouldst pick me out, To breathe Thy glamour on? I was a lass Happy and heartsome, till that dreesome day I walk'd from kirk by moonlight down the glen, And saw Maccaskill of Craig-Dhonil pass, Sewn to the middle in his winding-sheet, And waving hairy arms until I swoon'd;— And ere a year was run Maccaskill died; And then I kenn'd I had the bitter gift My father and my father's father had. Yet I was young, and felt a kind o' pride, To see so far into Thy mysteries,— To ken when man or wife was doom'd to die; To see the young life in a lassie's wame, Although her snood was whole; to prophesy Tempests and human losses. Many a man Then turn'd away; but Kenneth married me— Kenneth Macdonald, sheep-herd on the hills, A holy man and kind; and for a time The glamour came no more, and I was gay, Feeling the young bairn underneath my breast Breathe softly with the rocking of my heart. But in the winter gloaming, when the drift Was thick around the door, and winds were blowing, And I was lying on the jizzen-bed, And Jean the howdie wash'd my paps with salt, I saw a strange thing lying on her knee— A span-long body in a blood-stain'd sowe— And scream'd and cried, ‘Jean, Jean, the bairn will die!’ And so it was. For while old mother slipt Out to the kitchen lowe, where Kenneth sat, To drop a cinder through the wee white sark, The bairn came dead into the chilly mirk; And in the snowy dawning I beheld The span-long body of my sweet first-born, Wrapt in its sowe, upon the howdie's knee. But Angus lived—my white-faced sickly bairn, The last I bore; for, ere I rose from bed, I heard, one gloaming dark, from but the house, A sound of sawing, hewing with an adze, Mix'd with a sound of weeping, clapping hands; And all the bield was empty,—and I knew A shell was being made for some one near; And ah! before the moon was full again Just as the season of the lambing came, My bonnie man was sheeted in the house, And stiff, and cold; and I was left alone, Shadow'd and sad, with hot tears dropping down On Angus, pulling feebly at my breast. I never bedded with another man, Never bare wéan again; but I could earn Both food and drink, and all my pride and joy Was Angus. Lord, he was the bonniest bairn The sweetest, gentlest, ever wrought in flesh, To gladden mother's eyes. The very day That he was born, I call'd the minister, Who gave him baptism, that the glamour ne'er, Might come on him or his; and ah! he grew, Pale like a lily—for this solemn world O'er gentle; and the glamour brought no fear To mirk our dwelling. Nay, for many a year, The eerie light seem'd gone away from me, For never ghaist or burial cross'd my path, Corpse-light or wraith. Then Angus on the hills Grew sheep-herd, like his father, though he lack'd His father's fearless heart; and, as he grew, Turn'd weaker, whiter—bonnie still, but thin And bloodless; and he lack'd the heart to face Darkness and danger: ringing of a bell At midnight, sudden footsteps in the dark, A hand placed on his shoulder suddenly, Would strike him down into a swooning fit, Dreesome to see; and when his eighteenth year Was o'er, he sometimes sicken'd at my face, And shiver'd though he knew me. All at once The glamour came across my Soul again. One night, while we were seated in the bield, I heard a wailing come from but the house, And horror gript me. ‘Mother!’ Angus cried, Glow'ring full fear'd into my burning eyes, ‘What ails thee?’ ‘Wheesht!’ I whisper'd; ‘hear ye nought?’ ‘Nought! Angus said. And then I heard a sound Of groans, and clapping hands; and suddenly I saw my Angus shrink until he grew As small as any babe new-born, and turn, Swift as the fireflaught, to himself again?— And while I scream'd, and fell upon his neck, Weeping, and kissing him, and moaning low, He sicken'd at my face, and swoon'd away. For, though I hid the trouble from my bairn, Long had he known his mother was a seer, Whose eyes were troubled by mysterious things; And every shade he saw upon my face Distraught him, lest I saw before his path Mishap or death. My white-faced, fearful bairn! My drooping Angus, with his soft, wide eyes, And fluttering mouth! Alone upon the hills, He trembled—fear'd the lightning and the storm— Tholed not to lie within the dark alone— And would have wither'd in his bairndom's time, Had I not cheer'd him with a smiling face. Lord, Thou wert sore upon me! I was lone, And Angus was my pleasure. I was haunted, And Angus was my help. Yet, once again, Thy glamour struck me, and I knew, I knew, Angus must die. Hard, hard, both day and night, I tried to cheat myself and hope, and smiled On Angus, till his heart grew still once more. But it was all in vain. Thrice Angus shrunk. Three several gloamings, seated in his chair. And I kept down my fear, and did not scream; And oft I heard the wailing in the house, And sounding of the kirk-bells down Glen-Earn At midnight. Then I sicken'd and grew thin, And hunger'd o'er my bairn, and pray'd, and pray'd,— And what to me was light of sun or star If Angus went away? . . . It was a night Quiet and cold. The moon and stars were out, The moon-dew glittering on the hills. Alone, I sat, awaiting Angus. It grew late, And Angus came not; and the low winds blew, And the clock tick'd, and ah! my heart was dark. Then, last, I took my cloak, and wander'd forth, To see if he was coming down the Glen, And took the cold wet pathway in the moon Until I reach'd the foot of Cawmock Craig, And saw the straight rock rise into the lift, Its side all dark, but on its top the Moon Shining full bright and chilly. As I stood. I heard a shout, and saw, far, far above, A figure dark between me and the lift, Threading the narrow paths around the Craig Whence many a man hath fallen and been slain; And even then—Lord, Lord!—Thy glamour dropt Upon me, and I saw before my face The wraith of Angus wrapt in bloody sowe Gliding before me in the ghaistly light. Shrill as an owl, I screech'd!—and up above My Angus heard, and sicken'd, and swam round, And, swooning on the sharp edge of the Craig, Dash'd downward to his death!— . . . O bonnie, bonnie Look'd Angus, lying in his sowe asleep, Quiet like moonlight on his face, his hair Kaim'd back and shining round his cold white ears. And yonder in the cold kirkyard he lies; And, Lord, I want to slumber at his side, And cheer him in the darkness of the grave,— For he was ever fearful, weak, and pale— A young man with a white bairn's timorous soul. And, Lord, I think that Thou at last art kind, For oft the white wraith, glimmering at my side, Hath waved its arms, and moan'd, and look'd like me: And I have watched it ever, not afraid, But sad and smiling, and what dress I wore The wraith hath worn; and when I turn'd my gown And let the grey hairs hang all down my neck, The wraith too, turn'd its gown, and loos'd its hair; And yonder, yonder, yonder through the pane The blue corpse-candles, blowing in the wind, Flit slowly to the kirkyard, down Glen-Earn. SIGURD OF SAXONY. (MEDIÆVAL.) The sedgy shores of this enchanted lake Are dark with shadows of the swans which make Their nests along its marge; And on the hither side, where silver waves Curl with low music into hollow caves, Waiting for that bright barge Which beareth sleepers to the silent land, I, Sigurd, in my ghostly sorrow, stand. I stand alone beneath heaven's silent arch, Shaded both night and day by clouds that march And countermarch above; A sombre suit of perfect mail I wear, A gloomy plume, that troubles the thin air To murmurs if I move; My sword is red and broken; and my shield Bears a gold anchor on a sable field. This is a place where mortals find not speech; Save the small murmurous waves that crawl the beach, All is as still as death: I hear my heart against my ribs of stone, Like to a wild bird in the net, make moan; My slow and frozen breath Curls like a vapour o'er the silent spot; My shadow seeks my feet, and moveth not. Nought can redeem her. Wherefore I seek grace To join her in her distant dwelling-place Of pastoral repose; And I would make this heart that aches and grieves As white and perfect as a lily's leaves And fragrant as a rose, That with a stainless spirit I may take The solemn barge across the enchanted lake. For, having worn her stainless badge in fight, Thrice conquering in her name, by day and night I rode with vizor down, Meeting and slaying honourable foes, Wounded in flesh, giving and taking blows To compass her renown. Thus, warring a sweet war without reprieve, I, Sigurd, wore her badge upon my sleeve. Arméd from head to heel, with spear in hand, I cried her praises through the wondering land, And few her praise refused; Then flushing with my victory complete, I hastened back and knelt me at her feet, Battered, and maimed, and bruised; And then I wooed her in a secret place, With light upon me from her shining face. She bathed my bloody brow, with red wounds striped, And with a kerchief white as snow she wiped The foam from off my mouth; She set my unhelmed head upon her knee, And wound white arms about me tenderly, And slaked the thirsty drouth That ebbed in sluggish fire through blood and brain, From a full cup of cool white porcelain. Wherefore my soul again was strong. I caught The voiceless music of her form and thought. I knelt upon my knee, Saying, ‘I love thee more than life or fame; I love thee only less than my good name, Which is a part of thee; And I adore thy beauty undefiled!’ Whereat she looked into mine eyes and smiled. I wooed her night and day with virtuous deeds, And that humility which intercedes With ladies for true men. I took her lily of a hand in mine, Drinking her breath, as soft as eglantine, And wooing well; and then She toyed with my great beard, and gave consent: So down the flowery path of love we went. Twined closely, down the soft descent of love We wandered on, with golden stars above, And many flowers below, Until we came to this dark lake or sea, Which openeth upon eternity, And could no farther go; For beyond life and death, and these dark skies, The place of sleep, the Silent Valley, lies. Here on the beach we stood, and hand in hand Waited to wander to that silent land, And all the shore was dark; Saying, ‘We yearn to see the Happy Vale, And hand in hand together we will sail In the enchanted barque.’ Too late to turn: one passage we must take Across the gleaming silence of the lake. She said, ‘The waters make such threatening moan, Neither can pass across their waste alone; We cannot, cannot part; We will together cross these waves of death.’ But the dark waves grew darker, and the breath Came colder from the heart; And by each face a quiet cloud was worn, Small as the shadow of a lamb new born. Then in the distant waves we could behold A radiance like the blowing autumn gold Of woodland forests deep; And my sweet lady trembled, growing white As foam of ocean on a summer night, When the wild surges leap; And falling very cold upon my breast, She faltered, ‘I am weary,—let me rest.’ I laid her down upon a flowery bed, And put soft mosses underneath her head, And kissed her, and she slept; And the air brightened round her, as the far Blue ether burns like silver round a star. And round her slumber crept A trouble of the air, and silver clear The ghostly light upon the lake grew near. Yea, nearer, nearer grew the light, and soon, Shaped like the sickle of the early moon, The barge drew shoreward slow— A vapour and a radiance all around, A gleaming of fair faces, and a sound Of flutes and lute-strings low. And round my lady crept a shadowy crowd, Fading and brightening like a moonlit cloud. They clustered with a ghostly light around My lady dear, and raised her from the ground, And bare her to the barque: Whereon I would have followed, but a hand Held me like iron to the hated land. Then all again was dark; And from the breathing darkness came a hum Of voices sweet, ‘Thy time has not yet come.’ And then I shrieked in utter agony; While fading far away upon the sea, I saw the light again; And with a cry into the waves I sprung, And sought to follow, but the waters clung About me like a chain; And thrice I fought amid their rage and roar, And thrice they hurled me bleeding on the shore. Long have I waited here, alone, alone, Hearing the melancholy waves make moan Upon the pebbly beach: With eyes upon the pitiless stars above Here have I waited in my homeless love, Pale, patient, deaf to speech, With the salt rheum upon me, pale and bent, And breathless as a marble monument. This lonely watching would invite despair Did I not oft catch glimpses of my fair Lady, so sadly lost, Making, with radiance round her like a star, A luminous pathway on the hill afar, Then fading like a ghost; What time I shout aloud, and at the shout Pause, shuddering at the echoes round about. Twice has the barge returned: once for a bent Old servitor, who, down the soft descent That leads to this dim land, Had wandered from the towns that lie behind, And, groping in the cold, had fall'n stone-blind Upon the shifting sand; Once for a little gold-haired child astray, Who, wandering hither, fell to sleep at play. Twice has the mystic barge returned, and twice Have I been frozen to the earth in ice, Helpless to move or speak; Thrice have I fought with the relentless roar Of water, and been flung upon the shore Battered, and maimed, and weak; But now I wait with quiet heart and brain, Grown patient with unutterable pain. And I will wait. To slay myself were sin, And I, self-slaughter'd, could not hope to win My solitary boon; But if the barge should come again, and leave Me still in lonely watch without reprieve, Under the silver moon I will lie down upon my back and rest, With mailéd hands crossed praying on my breast; And fall to slumber on a bed of weeds, A knight well worn in honourable deeds, Yet lost to life, and old; And haply I may dream before I wake That I am floating o'er the pathless lake In that bright barge of gold; And, waking, I may see with sweet surprise Light shining on me from my lady's eyes. A POEM TO DAVID. David Gray, Author of The Luggie, and other Poems. I. I would not be lying yonder, Where thou, belovéd, art lying, Though the nations should crown me living, And murmur my praises dying. Better this fierce pulsation, Better this aching brain, Than dream, and hear faintly above me The cry of the wind and the rain; Than lie in the kirkyard lonely, With fingers and toes upcurled, And be conscious of never a motion Save the slow rolling round of the world. I would not be lying yonder, Though the seeds I had sown were springing! I would not be sleeping yonder, And be done with striving and singing! For the eyes are blinded with mildew, The lips are clammy with clay, And worms in the ears are crawling,— But the brain is the brain for aye! The brain is warm and glowing, Whatever the body be; It stirs like a thing that breatheth, And dreams of the Past and To be! Ay! down in the deep damp darkness The brains of the dead are hovelled! They gleam on each other with radiance, Transcending the eye that is shrivelled! Each like a faint lamp lighteth The skull wherein it dwelleth! Each like a lamp turneth brighter Whenever the kirk-bell knelleth! I would not be lying yonder Afar from the music of things, Not were my green grave watered By the tears of queens and kings. If the brain like a thing that breatheth Is full of the Past and To be, The silence is far more awful Than the shriek and the agony; And the hope that sweetened living Is gone with the light of the sun, And the struggle seems wholly over, And nothing at all seems done; And the dreams are heavy with losses, And sins, and errors, and wrongs, And you cannot hear in the darkness If the people are singing your songs! There's only the slow still rolling Of the dark world round and round, Making the dream more wondrous, Though it render the sleep more sound. 'Tis cold, cold, cold and weary, Cold in a weary place: The sense of the sin is present Like the gleam of a demon's face! What matter the tingling fingers That touch the song above you? What matter the young man's weeping, And longing to know you and love you? Nought has been said and uttered, Nought has been seen or known,— Detraction, the adder above you, Is sunned on the cold grave-stone. II. Yet 't is dark here, dark, And the voices call from below! 'T is so dark, dark, dark, That it seems not hard to go! 'T is dark, dark, dark, And we close our eyes and are weary! 'T is dark, dark, dark, And the waiting seems bitter and dreary! And yonder the sun is shining, And the green, long grass hath grown, And the cool kirk-shade looks pleasant, And you lie so alone, so alone! The world is heartless and hollow, And singing is sad without you, And I think I could bear the dreaming Were mine arms around about you; Were thy lips to mine, belovéd, And thine arms around me too, I think I could lie in silence, And dream as we used to do! The flesh and the bones might wither, The blood be dried like dew, The heart might crumble to ashes, Till dust was dust anew; And the world with its slow still motion Might roll on its heavenward way,— And our brains upon one another Would gleam till the Judgment Day! HAKON. Hakon of Thule, ere he died, Summoned a Priest to his bed-side. ‘Ho, Priest!’ with blackening brow quoth he, ‘What comfort canst thou cast to me?’ The young Priest, with a timorous mouth, Told of the new gods of the South,— Of Mary Mother and her Child, And holy Saints with features mild; Of those who hate and those who love, Of Hell beneath and Heaven above. Then Hakon laughed full loud and shrill— ‘Serve thy puny gods who will!’ Then, roaring to his henchman red, ‘Slit me the throat o' the Priest,’ he said; ‘His red heart's blood shall flow before, As steaming sacrifice to Thor! ‘Bring me my mighty drinking-cup: With fiery wine now fill it up!’ Then, though so faint his life's blood ran, ‘Let me die standing, like a man!’ He swore, and staggered to his legs, And drained the goblet to the dregs. ‘Skaal be to the gods!’ he said— His great heart burst, and he was dead! Sonnets WRITTEN BY LOCH CORUISK, For a detailed description of Loch Coruisk, see the writer's Prose Works, Volume v. ISLE OF SKYE. (1870.) Late in the gloaming of the year, I haunt the melancholy Mere; A Phantom I, where phantoms brood, In that soul-searching solitude. Hiding my forehead in the dim Hem of His robe, I question Him! CORUISKEN SONNETS. I. Lord, is it Thou? Lord, is it Thou? God, do I touch indeed Thy raiment hem, that rolls like vapour dark? O homeless Spirit, that fleest us in our need, Pause! answer! while I kneel, remain and mark. . . Father! . . . Ere back they bear me, cold and stark, Across Thy darken'd threshold,—ere I plead For love no longer, pity me, and hark! Surviving the long tale of craft and creed, The dumb Hills gather round me, gaunt and gray,— The Waters utter their monotonous moan,— The immemorial Heavens, with no groan, Bend dim eyes down, as on their natal day: Cold are all these as snow, and still as stone; But I have found a voice—to plead, to pray. II. We are Fatherless. I found Thee not by the starved widow's bed, Nor in the sick-rooms where my dear ones died; In Cities vast I hearken'd for Thy tread, And heard a thousand call Thee, wretched-eyed, Worn out, and bitter. But the Heavens denied Their melancholy Maker. From the Dead! Assurance came, nor answer. Then I fled Into these wastes, and raised my hands, and cried: ‘The seasons pass—the sky is as a pall— Thin wasted hands on withering hearts we press— There is no God—in vain we plead and call, In vain with weary eyes we search and guess— Like children in an empty house sit all, Cast-away children, lorn and fatherless.’ III. We are Children. Children indeed are we—children that wait Within a wondrous Dwelling, while on high Stretch the sad vapours and the voiceless sky; The House is fair, yet all is desolate Because our Father comes not; clouds of fate Sadden above us—shivering we espy The passing rain, the cloud before the gate, And cry to one another, ‘He is nigh!’ At early morning, with a shining Face, He left us innocent and lily-crown'd; And now 'tis late—night cometh on apace— We hold each other's hands and look around, Frighted at our own shades! Heaven send us grace! When He returns, all will be sleeping sound. IV. When we are all Asleep. When He returns, and finds the World so drear— All sleeping,—young and old, unfair and fair, Will He stoop down and whisper in each ear, ‘Awaken!’ or for pity's sake forbear,— Saying, ‘How shall I meet their frozen stare Of wonder, and their eyes so full of fear? How shall I comfort them in their despair, If they cry out, “Too late! let us sleep here”?’ Perchance He will not wake us up, but when He sees us look so happy in our rest, Will murmur, ‘Poor dead women and dead men! Dire was their doom, and weary was their quest. Wherefore awake them unto life again? Let them sleep on untroubled—it is best.’ V. But the Hills will bear Witness. But ye,—ye Hills that gather round this day, Ye Mountains, and ye Vapours, and ye Waves, Ye will attest the wrongs of men of clay, When, in a World all hush'd, sits on our graves The melancholy Maker. From your caves Strange echoes of our old lost life shall come; With still eyes fixed on your vast architraves, Nature shall speak, though mortal lips be dumb. Then God will cry: ‘Sadly the Waters fall, Sadly the Mountains keep their snowy state, The Clouds pass on, the Winds and Echoes call, The World is sweet, yet wearily I wait. Though all is fair, and I am Lord of all, Without my Children I am desolate.’ VI. Desolate! Desolate! How the Peaks of ashen gray, The smoky Mists that drift from hill to hill, The Waters dark, anticipate this day That sullen desolation. Oh, how still The shadows come and vanish, with no will! How still the Waters watch the heaven's array! How still the melancholy vapours stray, Mirror'd below, and drifting on, fulfil Thy mandate as they mingle!—Not a sound, Save that deep murmur of a torrent near, Deepening silence. Hush! the dark profound Groans, as some gray crag loosens and falls sheer To the abyss. Wildly I look around, O Spirit of the Human, are Thou here? VII. Lord, art Thou here? Lord, art Thou here? far from the citied zones, Brooding in melancholy solitude; Hushing Thy breath to awful undertones, Darkening Thy face, if mortal foot intrude. Father, how shall I meet Thee in this mood? How shall I ask Thee why Thou dwell'st with stones, While far away the world, like Lazarus, groans, Sick for Thy healing. Father, if Thou be'st good, And wise, and gentle, oh come down come down! Come like an Angel with a human face, Pass through the gates into the hungry Town, Comfort the weary, send the afflicted grace, Shine brighter on the Graves where we lay down Our dear ones, cheer them in the narrow place! VIII. God is Beautiful. Oh, Thou art beautiful! and Thou dost bestow Thy beauty on this stillness—still as sheep The Hills lie under Thee; the Waters deep Murmur for joy of Thee; the voids below Mirror Thy strange fair Vapours as they flow; And now, afar upon the barren height, Thou sendest down a radiant look of light So that the still Peaks glisten, and a glow Rose-colour'd tints the little snowy cloud That poises on the highest peak of all. Oh, Thou art beautiful!—the Hills are bowed Beneath Thee; on Thy name the soft Winds call— The monstrous Ocean trumpets it aloud, The Rains and Snows intone it as they fall. IX. The Motion of the Mists. Here by the sunless Lake there is no air, Yet with how ceaseless motion, like a shower Flowing and fading, do the high Mists lower Amid the gorges of the Mountains bare. Some weary breathing never ceases there,— The barren peaks can feel it hour by hour; The purple depths are darken'd by its power; A soundless breath, a trouble all things share That feel it come and go. See! onward swim The ghostly Mists, from silent land to land, From gulf to gulf; now the whole air grows dim— Like living men, darkling a space, they stand. But lo! a Sunbeam, like the Cherubim, Scatters them onward with a flaming brand. X. Coruisk. I think this is the very stillest place On all God's earth, and yet no rest is here. The Vapours mirror'd in the black loch's face Drift on like frantic shapes and disappear; A never-ceasing murmur in mine ear Tells me of Waters wild that flow and flow. There is no rest at all afar or near, Only a sense of things that moan and go. And lo! the still small life these limbs contain I feel flows on like those, restless and proud; Before that breathing nought within my brain Pauses, but all drifts on like mist and cloud; Only the bald Peaks and the Stones remain, Frozen before Thee, desolate and bowed. XI. But Whither? And whither, O ye Vapours! do ye wend? Stirred by that weary breathing, whither away? And whither, O ye Dreams! that night and day Drift o'er the troublous life, tremble, and blend To broken lineaments of that far Friend, Whose strange breath's come and go ye must obey? O sleepless Soul! in the world's waste astray, Whither? and will thy wanderings ever end? All things that be are full of a quick pain; Onward we fleet, swift as the running rill,— The vapours drift, the mists within the brain Float on obscruingly and have no will. Only the bare Peaks and the Stones remain; These only,—and a God sublimely still. XII. God is Pitiless. Oh, Thou art pitiless! They call Thee Light, Law, Justice, Love; but Thou art pitiless. What thing of earth is precious in Thy sight, But weary waiting on and soul's distress? When dost Thou come with glorious hands to bless The good man that dies cold for lack of Thee? When bring'st Thou garlands for our happiness? Whom dost Thou send but Death to set us free? Blood runs like wine—foul spirits sit and rule— The weak are crushed in every street and lane— He who is generous becomes the fool Of all the world, and gives his life in vain. Wert Thou as good as Thou art beautiful, Thou couldst not bear to look upon such pain. XIII. Yea, Pitiless. Yea, Thou art pitiless—Thou dost permit The Priest to use Thee as a hangman's cord— Thou proppest up the Layman's shallow wit, Driving the Beggar from the laden board— Thou art the easy text of those who hoard Their gifts in secret chests for Death to see. ‘Mighty and strong and glorious is the Lord!’ The Prophet cries, gone mad for lack of Thee! While good men dying deem Thy grace a dream, While sick men wail for Thee and mad blaspheme, A thousand forms of Thee the foolish preach— Fair stretch Thy temples over all the lands, In each of these some barbarous Image stands, And men grow atheists in the shrine of each. XIV. Could God be Judged. Can I be calm, beholding everywhere Disease and Anguish busy, early and late? Can I be silent, nor compassionate The evils that both Soul and Body bear? Oh, what have sickly Children done, to share Thy cup of sorrows? yet their dull, sad pain Makes the earth awful;—on the, tomb's dark stair Moan Idiots, with no glimmer in the brain. No shrill Priest with his hangman's cord can beat Thy mercy into these—ah nay, ah nay! The Angels Thou hast sent to haunt the street Are Hunger and Distortion and Decay. Lord! that mad'st Man, and send'st him foes so fleet, Who shall judge Thee upon Thy judgment-day? XV. The Hills on their Thrones. Ghostly and livid, robed with shadow, see! Each mighty Mountain silent on its throne, From foot to scalp one stretch of livid stone, Without one gleam of grass or greenery. Silent they take the immutable decree— Darkness or sunlight come,—they do not stir; Each bare brow lifted desolately free, Keepeth the silence of a death-chamber. Silent they watch each other until-doom; They see each other's phantoms come and go, Yet stir not. Now the stormy hour brings gloom, Now all things grow confused and black below, Specific through the cloudy Drift they loom, And each accepts his individual woe. XVI. King Blaabhein. Monarch of these is Blaabhein. On his height The lightning and the snow sleep side by side, Like snake and lamb; he waiteth in a white And wintry consecration. All his pride Is husht this dimly-gleaming autumn day— He broodeth o'er the things he hath beheld— Beneath his feet the Rains crawl still and gray, Like phantoms of the mighty men of eld. A quiet awe the dreadful heights doth fill, The high clouds pause and brood above their King; The torrent murmurs gently as a rill; Softly and low the winds are murmuring; A small black speck above the snow, how still Hovers the Eagle, with no stir of wing! XVII. Blaabhein in the Mists. Watch but a moment—all is changed! A moan Breaketh the beauty of that noonday dream; The hoary Titan darkens on his throne, And with an indistinct and senile scream Gazes at the wild Rains as past they stream, Through vaporous air wild-blowing on his brow; All black, from scalp to base there is no gleam, Even his silent snows are faded now. Watch yet!—and yet!— Behold, and all is done— 'Twas but the shallow shapes that come and go, Troubling the mimic picture in the eye. Still and untroubled sits the kingly one. Yonder the Eagle floats—there sleeps the Snow Against the pale green of the cloudless sky. XVIII. The Fiery Birth of the Hills. O hoary Hills, though ye look aged, ye Are but the children of a latter time— Methinks I see ye in that hour sublime When from the hissing cauldron of the Sea Ye were upheaven, while so terribly The Clouds boiled, and the Lightning scorched ye bare. Wild, new-born, blind, Titans in agony, Ye glared at heaven through folds of fiery hair! . . . Then, in an instant, while ye trembled thus A Hand from heaven, white and luminous, Pass'd o'er your brows, and husht your fiery breath. Lo! one by one the still Stars gather'd round, The great Deep glass'd itself, and with no sound A cold Snow fell, and all was still as death. XIX. The Changeless Hills. All power, all virtue, is repression—ye Are stationary, and God keeps ye great; Around your heads the fretful winds play free; Ye change not—ye are calm and desolate. What seems to us a trouble and a 'ate Is but the loose dust streaming from your feet And drifting onward—early ye sit and late, While unseen Winds waft past the things that fleet. So sit for ever, still and passionless As He that made you!—thought and soul's distress Ye know not, though ye contemplate the strife; Better to share the Spirit's bitterest aches— Better to be the weakest Wave that breaks On a wild Ocean of tempestuous Life. XX. O Mountain Peak of a God. Father, if Thou imperturbable art, Passive as these, lords of a lonely land— If, having laboured, Thou must sit apart— If having once open'd the Void, and planned This tragedy, Thou must impassive stand Spectator of the scenic flow of things, Then I—a drop of dew, a grain of sand— Pity Thy lot, poor palsied King of Kings. Better to fail and fail, to shriek and shriek, Better to break, like any Wave, and go,— Impotent godhead, let Thy slave be weak!— Yea, do not freeze my Soul, but let it flow— Oh, wherefore call to Thee, a mountain Peak Impassive, beautiful, serene with snow? XXI. God the Image. Impassive, beautiful, and desolate, Is this the Lord my God, whom I entreat? Powerless to stay the ravages of fate— Jove with his right hand palsied, Jove effete, Fetter'd by frost upon a stony seat— O dreadful apparition! Can this be? Yonder He looms, where never a heart doth beat, In the cold ether of theology. Come down! come down! O Souls that wander there! Cold are the snows, chill is the dreadful air— Come down! come down into the Valleys deep; Leave the wild Image to the stars, that rise Around about it with affrighted eyes; Come to green under-glooms, and sink, and sleep. XXII. The Footprints. Come to green under-glooms,—and in your hair Weave nightshade, foxglove red, and rank wolfsbane, And slumber and forget Him; if in vain Ye try to slumber off your sorrow there, Arise once more and openly repair To busy haunts where men and women sigh, And if all things but echo back your care, Cry out aloud, ‘There is no God!’ and die. But if upon a day when all is dark, Thou, stooping in the public ways, shalt mark Strange luminous footprints as of feet that shine— Follow them! follow them! O soul bereaven! God had a Son—He hath pass'd that way to heaven: Follow, and look upon the Face divine! XXIII. We are Deathless. Yet hear me, Mountains! echo me, O Sea! Murmur an answer, Winds, from out your caves; Cry loudly, Torrents, Mountains, Winds, and Waves— Hark to my crying all, and echo me— All things that live are deathless—I and ye. The Father could not slay us if He would; The Elements in all their multitude Will rise against their Master terribly, If but one hair upon a human head Should perish! . . . Darkness grows on crag and steep, A hollow thunder fills the torrent's bed; The wild Mists moan and threaten as they creep; And hush! now, when all other cries are fled, The warning murmur of the white-hair'd Deep. XXIV. A Voice in the Whirlwind. I heard a Whirlwind on the mountain peak Pause for a space its furious flight and cry— ‘There is no Death!’ loudly it seemed to shriek; ‘Nothing that is, beneath the sun, shall die.’ The frail sick Vapours echoed, drifting by— ‘There is no Death, but change early and late; Powerless were God's right Hand; full arm'd with fate, To slay the meanest thing beneath the sky.’ Yea, even as tremulous foam-bells on the sea, Coming and going, are all things of breath; But evermore, deathless, and bright, and free, We re-emerge, in spite of Change or Death. Hearken, O Mountains! Waters, echo me! O wild Wind, echo what the Man-Wind saith! XXV. Cry of the Little Brook. Christ help me! whither would my dark thoughts run, I look around me, trembling fearfully; The dreadful silence of the Silent One Freezes my lips, and all is sad to see. Hark! hark! what small voice murmurs ‘God made me!’ It is the Brooklet, singing all alone, Sparkling with pleasure that is all its own, And running, self-contented, sweet, and free. O Brooklet, born where never grass is green, Finding the stony hill and flowing fleet, Thou comest as a Messenger serene, With shining wings and silver-sandall'd feet; Faint falls thy music on a Soul unclean, And, in a moment, all the World looks sweet! XXVI. The Happy Hearts of Earth. Whence thou hast come, thou knowest not, little Brook, Nor whither thou art bound. Yet wild and gay, Pleased in thyself, and pleasing all that look, Thou wendest, all the seasons, on thy way; The lonely glen grows gladsome with thy play, Thou glidest lamb-like through the ghostly shade; To think of solemn things thou wast not made, But to sing on, for pleasure, night and day. Such happy hearts are wandering, crystal clear, In the great world where men and women dwell; Earth's mighty shows they neither love nor fear, They are content to be, while I rebel, Out of their own delight dispensing cheer, And ever softly whispering, ‘All is well!’ XXVII. Father, forgive Thy Child. Oh sing, clear Brook, sing on, while in a dream I feel the sweetness of the years go by! The crags and peaks are softened now, and seem Gently to sleep against the gentle sky; Old scenes and faces glimmer up and die, With outlines of sweet thought obscured too long; Like boys that shout at play far voices cry; Oh sing! for I am weeping at the song. I know not what I am, but only know I have had glimpses tongue may never speak; No more I balance human joy and woe, But think of my transgressions, and am meek. Father! forgive the child who fretted so,— His proud heart yields,—the tears are on his cheek! XXVIII. God's Loneliness. When, in my strong affection, I have sought To play at Providence with men of clay, How hath my good come constantly to nought, How hath my light and love been cast away,— How hath my light been light to lead astray, How hath my love become of sorry worth, How feeble hath been all my soul's essay To aid one single man on all God's earth! Father in Heaven, when I think these things, Helpless Thou seemest to redeem our plight— Thy lamp shines on shut eyes—each Spirit springs To its own stature still in Thy despite— While haggard Nature round Thy footstool clings, Pale, powerless, sitt'st Thou, in a Lonely Light. XXIX. The Cup of Tears. My God! my God! with passionate appeal, Pardon I crave for these mad moods of mine,— Can I remember, with no heart to feel, The gift of Thy dear Son, the Man Divine— My God! what agonies of love were Thine, Sitting alone, forgotten, on Thy height, Pale, powerless, awful in that Lonely Light, While 'neath Thy feet the cloudy hyaline Rain'd blood upon the darkness,—where Thine Own Held the black Cup of all earth's tears, and cried! Ev'n then, tho' Thou wert conscious of his groan, Pale in that Lonely Light Thou did'st abide, Nor dared, even then, tho' shaken on Thy throne, To reach Thy hand and dash the Cup aside. XXX. The Light of the World. On the dark waters of man's thought still gleams Softly and silvernly, from night to night, That starlight Legend, though its substance seems Consuming in the melancholy light It sheddeth. Father, do I see aright? Is it a truth or most divine of dreams? That He, Thy Child, walk'd once in raiment white With mortal men, and mused by Syrian streams? O Life that puts our noblest life to shame, Was it a Star, or light to lead astray? Thought's waves grow husht beneath that silvern flame, Our hopes pursue it and our doubts obey; And whether truth or phantom, it became The sweetest sphere that lights the World's black way. XXXI. Earth's Eldest Born. But He, the only One of mortal birth Who raised the Veil and saw the Face behind, While yet He wander'd footsore on the earth, Beheld His Father's Eyes,—that they were kind. Here in the dark I grope, confused, purblind; I have not seen the glory and the peace; But on the darken'd mirror of the mind Strange glimmers fall, and shake me till they cease— Then, wondering, dazzled, on Thy name I call, And, like a child, reach empty hands and moan, And broken accents from my wild lips fall, And I implore Thee in this human tone;— If such as I can follow Him at all Into Thy presence, 'tis by love alone. XXXII. What Spirit Cometh? Who cometh wandering hither in my need? What gentle Ghost from Heaven cometh now?— Oh, I am broken to the rod indeed— Father, my earthly father, is it thou? The stooping shape with piteous human brow, The dear quaint gesture, and the feeble pace, The weary-eyed, world-worn, belovëd face, Ev'n as they wildly faded, meet me now. A gentle voice flows softly, saying plain: ‘From death comes light, from pain beatitude; Chide not at loss, for out of loss comes gain; Chide not at grief, for 'tis the Soul's best food— Out of my death-chamber, out of wrong and pain, Cometh a life and odour. God is good.’ XXXIII. Stay, O Spirit! Father, my earthly father, stay, oh stay! I know thou wert a man as others be; Sore were thy feet upon the World's cold clay, And thou didst stumble oft, and on thy knee Knelt little; but thy gentle heart gleamed free In cloud and shadow, giving its best cheer; Thou had'st an open hand, and laugh'd for glee When happy men or creatures dumb played near. But in thy latter years God's scourge was sore Upon thee—weary were thy wrongs and dire,— Yet blessings on thee—until all was o'er, Cheery thou wert beside a cheerless fire— Till one red dawn the mark was on the door, And thou wert dead to all the world's desire. XXXIV. Quiet Waters. O Rainbow, Rainbow, on the livid height, Softening its ashen outlines into dream, Dewy yet brilliant, delicately bright As pink wild-roses' leaves, why dost thou gleam So beckoningly? Whom dost thou invite Still higher upward on the bitter quest? What dost thou promise to the weary sight In that strange region whence thou issuest? Speakest thou of pensive runlets by whose side Our dear ones wander sweet and gentle-eyed, In the soft dawn of some diviner Day? Art thou a promise? Come those hues and dyes From heavenly Meads, near which thou dost arise, Iris'd from Quiet Waters, far away! The Book of Orm. (1870.) ‘This also we humbly beg,—that Human things may not prejudice such as are Divine, neither that from the unlocking of the Gates of Sense, and the kindling of a greater Natural Light, anything of incredulity or intellectual night may arise in our minds towards Divine Mysteries.’— Student's Prayer, Bacon. ‘To vindicate the ways of God to man.’— Milton. ‘God's Mystery will I vindicate, the Mystery of the Veil and of the Shadow; yea, also Death and Sorrow, God's divine Angels on all earths; and I will vindicate the Soul, that the Soul may vindicate the Flesh; and all these things shall vindicate Evil, proving God's mercy to His creatures, great and small.’—A Rune found in the Starlight. INSCRIPTION. To F. W. C. Flowers pluckt upon a grave by moonlight, pale And suffering, from the spiritual light They grew in: these, with all the love and blessing That prayers can gain of God, I send to thee! PROEM. (TO BOOK OF ORM AND POLITICAL MYSTICS.) When in these songs I name the Name of God, I mean not Him who ruled with brazen rod The rulers of the Jew; nor Him who calm Sat reigning on Olympus; nay, nor Brahm, Osiris, Allah, Odin, Balder, Thor, (Though these I honour, with a hundred more); Menu I mean not, nor the Man Divine, The pallid Rainbow lighting Palestine; Nor any lesser of the gods which Man Hath conjured out of Night since Time began. I mean the primal Mystery and Light, The most Unfathomable, Infinite, The Higher Law, Impersonal, Supreme, The Life in Life, the Dream within the Dream, The Fountain which in silent melody Feeds the dumb waters of Eternity, The Source whence every god hath flown and flows, And whither each departs to find repose. THE BOOK OF THE VISIONS SEEN BY ORM THE CELT. There is a mortal, and his name is Orm, Born in the evening of the world, and looking Back from the sunset to the gates of morning. And he is aged early, in a time When all are aged early,—he was born In twilight times, and in his soul is twilight. O brother, hold me by the hand, and hearken, For these things I shall phrase are thine and mine, And all men's,—all are seeking for a sign. Thou wert born yesterday, but thou art old, Weary to-day, to-morrow thou wilt sleep— Take these for kisses on thy closing eyelids. I. FIRST SONG OF THE VEIL. How God in the beginning drew Over his face the Veil of blue, Wherefore no soul of mortal race Hath ever look'd upon the Face; Children of earth whose spirits fail Heark to the First Song of the Veil. I. The Veil Woven. In the beginning, Ere Man grew, The Veil was woven Bright and blue; Soft mists and vapours Gather'd and mingled Over the black world Stretched below, While winds of heaven Blew from all places, Shining luminous, A starry snow. Blindly, dumbly, Darken'd under Ocean and river, Mountain and dale, While over his features, Wondrous, terrible, The beautiful Master Drew the Veil: Then starry, luminous, Rolled the Veil of azure O'er the first dwellings Of mortal race; —And since the beginning No mortal vision, Pure or sinning, Hath seen the Face Yet mark me closely! Strongly I swear, Seen or seen not, The Face is there! When the Veil is clearest And sunniest, Closest and nearest The Face is prest; But when, grown weary With long downlooking, The Face withrawing For a time is gone, The great Veil darkens, And ye see full clearly Glittering numberless The gems thereon. For the lamp of his features Divinely burning, Shines, and suffuses The Veil with light, And the Face, drawn backward With that deep sighing Ye hear in the gloaming, Leaveth the Night. Thus it befell to men Graveward they journeyed, From waking to sleeping, In doubt and in fear, Evermore hoping, Evermore seeking, Nevermore guessing The Master so near: Making strange idols, Rearing fair Temples, Crying, denying, Questioning, dreaming, Nevermore certain Of God and His grace,— Evermore craving, To look on a token, To gaze on a Face. Now an Evangel, Whom God loved deep, Said, ‘See! the mortals, How they weep! They grope in darkness, They blunder onward From race to race, Were it not better, Once and for ever, To unveil the Face?’ God smiled. He said—‘Not yet? Much is to remember, Much to forget; Be thou of comfort! How should the token Silence their wail?’ And, with eyes tear-clouded, He gazed through the luminous, Star-inwrought, beautiful, Folds of the Veil. II. Earth the Mother. Beautiful, beautiful, she lay below, The mighty Mother of humanity, Turning her sightless eyeballs to the glow Of light she could not see, Feeling the happy warmth, and breathing slow As if her thoughts were shining tranquilly. Beautiful, beautiful the Mother lay, Crownëd with silver spray, The greenness gathering hushfully around The peace of her great heart, while on her breast The wayward Waters, with a weeping sound, Were sobbing into rest. For all day long her face shone merrily, And at its smile the waves leapt mad and free: But at the darkening of the Veil, she drew The wild things to herself, and husht their cries. Then, stiller, dumber, search'd the deepening Blue With passionate blind eyes; And went the old life over in her thought, Dreamily praying as her memory wrought The dimly guessed at, never utter'd tale, While, over her dreaming, Deepen'd the luminous, Star-inwrought, beautiful, Folds of the wondrous Veil. For more than any of her children of clay The beautiful Mother knows— She is so old! Ye would go wild to hearken, if this day Her dumb lips should unclose, And the tale be told: Such unfathomable things, Such mystic vanishings, She knoweth about God—she is so old. For oft, in the beginning, long ago, Without a Veil looked down the Face ye know, And Earth, an infant happy-eyed and bright, Look'd smiling up, and gladden'd in its sight. But later, when the Man-Flower from her womb Burst into brightening bloom, In her glad eyes a golden dust was blown Out of the Void, and she was blind as stone. And since that day She hath not seen, nor spoken,—lest her say Should be a sorrow and fear to mortal race, And doth not know the Lord hath hid away, But turneth up blind orbs—to feel the Face. III. Children of Earth. So dumbly, blindly, So cheerly, sweetly, The beautiful Mother Of mortals smiled; Her children marvell'd And looked upon her— Her patient features Were bright and mild; And on her eyeballs Night and day, A sweet light glimmer'd From far away. Her children gather'd With sobs and cries, To see the sweetness Of sightless eyes; But though she held them So dear, so dear, She could not answer, She could not hear. She felt them flutter Around her knee, She felt their weeping, Yet knew not wherefore— She could not see. ‘O Mother! Mother Of mortal race! Is there a Father? Is there a Face?’ She felt their sorrow Against her cheek,— She could not hearken, She could not speak; With thin lips fluttering, With blind eyes tearful, And features pale, She clasp'd her children, And looked in silence Upon the Veil. Her hair grew silvern, The swift days fled, Her lap was heavy With children dead; To her heart she held them, But could not warm them— The life within them Was gone like dew. Whiter, stiller, The Mother grew. The World grew hoary, The World was weary, The children cried at The empty air: ‘Father of mortals!’ The children murmured, ‘Father! Father! Art Thou there?’ Then the Master answer'd From the thunder-cloud: ‘I am God the Maker! I am God the Master! I am God the Father!’ He cried aloud. Further, the Master Made sign on sign— Footprints of his spirits, Voices divine; His breath was a water, His cry was a wind. But the people heard not, The people saw not,— Earth and her children Were deaf and blind. IV. The Wise Men. ‘Call the great philosophers! Call them all hither,— The good, the wise!’ Their robes were snowy, Their hearts were holy, They had cold still eyes. To the mountain-summits Wearily they wander'd, Reaching the desolate Regions of snow, Looming there lonely, They searched the Veil wonderful With tubes fire-fashion'd In caverns below . . . God withdrew backward, And darker, dimmer, Deepen'd the day: O'er the philosophers Looming there lonely Night gather'd gray. Then the wise men gazing Saw the lights above them Thicken and thicken, And all went pale— Ah! the lamps numberless, The mystical jewels of God, The luminous, wonderful, Beautiful lights of the Veil! Alas for the Wise Men! The snows of the mountain Drifted about them, And the wind cried round them, As the lights of wonder Multiplied! The breath of the mountain Froze them into stillness,— They sighed and died. Still in the desolate Heights overhead, Stand their shapes frozen, Frozen and dead. But a weary few, Weary and dull and cold, Crept faintly down again, Looking very old; And when the people Gather'd around them, The heart went sickly At their dull blank stare— ‘O Wise Men answer! Is there a Father? Is there a beautiful Face up there?’ The Wise Men answer'd and said: ‘Bury us deep when dead— We have travelled a weary road, We have seen no more than ye. 'Twere better not to be— There is no God!’ And the people, hearkening, Saw the Veil above them, And the darkness deepen'd, And the Lights gleamed pale. Ah! the lamps numberless, The mystical jewels of God, The luminous, wonderful, Beautiful Lights of the Veil! II. THE MAN AND THE SHADOW. On the high path where few men fare, Orm meeteth one with hoary hair, And speaketh, solemn and afraid, Of that which haunteth him—a Shade. Slowly, with weary feet and weak, They wander to a mountain peak; And to the man with hoary hair A Bridge of Spirits riseth fair, Whereon his Soul with gentle moan Passeth unto the Land Unknown. I. The Shadow. O aged Man who, clad in pilgrim's garb, With staff of thorn and wallet lying near, Sittest among the weeds of the wayside, Gazing with hollow eyeballs, in a dream, On that which sleeps—a Shadow—at thy feet! Hearest thou? By the fluttering of thy lips, I know thou hearest; yet, with downcast eyes, Thou broodest moveless, letting yonder sun Make thee a Dial, worn and venerable, To show the passing hour. All things around Share stillness with thee; for behold they keep The gloaming of the year. To russet brown The heather fadeth; on the treeless hills, O'er rusted with the slow-decaying bracken, The sheep crawl slow with damp and red-stain'd wool; Keen cutting winds from the Cold Clime begin To frost the edges of the cloud—the Sun Upriseth slow and silvern—many Rainbows People the desolate air with flowers that fade Through pallor unto tears;—and though these flash Ever around thee, here thou sittest alone,— Best Dial of them all, old, moveless, dumb, Ineffably serene with aged eyes, Still as a stone,—yet with some secret spell Pertaining to the human, some faint touch Of mystery in that worn face, to show Thy wither'd flesh is scented with a Soul. Nay, then, with how serene and sad a light Thy face, strange gleams of spiritual pain Fading there, turneth up to mine! Yea, smile! Tender as sunlight on the autumn hills, Cometh that kindly lustre! Aye, thy hand— Something mysterious streameth from thy palm— Spirit greets spirit—scent is mixed with scent— Sweet is the touch of hands. Behold me,— Orm, Thy brother! Brother, we are surely bound On the same journey,—and our eyes alike Turn up and onward: wherefore, now thou risest, Lean on mine arm, and let us for a space Pursue the path together. Ah, 'tis much, In this so weary pilgrimage, to meet A royal face like thine; to touch the hand Of such a soul-fellow; to feel the want, The upward-crying hunger, the desire, The common hope and pathos, justified By knowledge and gray hairs. Come on! come on! Up yonder! Slowly, lcaning on my strength, And I will surely pick my steps with thine,— While at our backs the secret Shadows creep, And imitate our motions with no sound. Dost thou remember more than I? My Soul Remembereth no beginning. One still day, I saw the Hills around me, and beheld The Hills had shadows,—for beyond their rim The fiery Sun was setting;—then I saw My Ghost upon the gr und, and as I ran Eastward, the melancholy semblance ran Before my footsteps; and I felt afraid. Could I have shaken off this grievous thing, Much had been spared me. Since that day I ran, And saw it run before me in the sun, It hath been with me in the day and night, The sunlight and the starlight—at the board Hath joined me, darkening the festal cup— Hath risen black against the whitening wall On lonely midnights, when by the wind's shriek Startled from terrible visions seen in dream, Rising upon my couch, and with quick breath Lighting the lamp,I hearkened—it hath track'd My footsteps into pastoral churchyards, And suddenly, when I was very calm, Look'd darkly up out of the gentle graves, So that I clench'd my teeth, or should have scream'd; And still behind me—see!—it creeps and creeps, Dim in the dimness of this autumn day. Higher! yet higher! Though the path is steep, And all around the withering bracken rusts, Up yonder on the crag, a mossy spring, Frosted with silver, glistens, and around Grasses as green as hedgerows in the May Cushion the lichen'd stones. Here let us pause: Here, where the grass gleams emerald, and the spring Upbubbling faintly seemeth as a sound, A drowsy hum, heard in the mind itself— Here, in this stillness, let us pause and mark The many-colour'd Picture. Far beneath Sleepeth the glassy Ocean like a sheet Of liquid mother-o'-pearl, and on its rim A Ship sleeps, and the shadow of the ship; Astern the reef juts darkly, edged with foam, Through the smooth brine: oh, hark, how loudly sings A wild, weird ditty to a watery tune, The fisher among his nets upon the shore; And yonder, far away, his shouting bairns Are running, dwarf'd by distance small as mice, Along the yellow sands. Behind us, see The immeasurable Mountains, rising silent Against the fields of dreamy blue, wherein The rayless crescent of the mid-day Moon Lies like a reaper's sickle; and before us The immeasurable Mountains, rising silent From bourne to bourne, from knolls of thyme and heather, To leafless slopes of granite, from the slopes Of granite to the dim and dusky heights, Where, with a silver glimmer, silently Pausing, the white cloud sheds miraculous Snow On the heights untravell'd, whither we are bound. O perishable Brother, what a World! How wondrous and how fair! Look! look! and think! What magic mixed the tints of yonder west, Wherein, upon a cushion soft as moss, A heaven pink-tinted like a maiden's flesh, The dim Star of the Ocean lieth cool In palpitating silver, while beneath Her image, putting luminous feelers forth, Bathes liquid, like a living thing o' the Sea. What magic? What Magician? O my Brother, What strange Magician, mixing up those tints, Pouring the water down, and sending forth The crystal air like breath, snowing the heavens With luminous jewels of the day and night, Look'd down, and saw thee lie a lifeless clod, And lifted thee, and moulded thee to shape, Colour'd thee with the sunlight till thy blood Ran ruby, poured the chemic tints o' the air Through eyes that kindled into azure, stole The flesh-tints of the lily and the rose To make thee wondrous fair unto thyself, Knitted thy limbs with ruby bands, and blew Into thy hollow heart until it stirr'd,— Then to the inner chamber of his Heaven Withdrawing, left in midst of such a world The living apparition of a Man,— A mystery amid the mysteries,— A lonely Semblance, with a wild appeal To which no form that lives, however dear, Hath given a tearless answer,—a Shape, a Soul, Projecting ever as it ageth on A shade which is a silence and a sleep. Yet not companionless, within this waste Of splendour, dwellest thou—here by thy side I linger, girdled for the road like thee, With pilgrim's staff and scrip; and through the vales, Below, a Storm of people like to thee Drifts with thee westward darkly, cloud on cloud, Uttering a common moan, and to our eyes Casting one common shadow; yet each Soul Therein now seeketh, with a want like thine, The inevitable bourne. Nor those alone, Thy perishable brethren, share thy want, And wander haunted through the world; but Beasts, With that dumb hunger in their eyes, project Their darkness—by the yeanling Lambkin's side Its shade plays, and the basking Lizard hath Its image on the flat stone in the sun,— And these, the greater and the less, like thee Shall perish in their season: in the mere The slender Water-Lily sees her shape, And sheddeth softly on the summer air Her last chill breathing; and the forest Tree That, standing glorious for a hundred years, Lengthens its shadow daily from the sun, Fulfilleth its own prophecy at last, And falleth, falleth. Art thou comforted? Nay, then,—behold the Shadows of the Hills, Attesting these are perishable too, And cry no more thou art companionless. How, like a melancholy bell, thy voice Echoes the word! ‘Companionless!’ Thine eyes Suffer with light and tears, and wearily Thou searchest all the picture beautiful For vanished faces. Still, ‘companionless!’ O Brother, let me hold thy hand again— Spirit greets spirit—scent is mixed with scent— Sweet is the touch of hands. Look on me! Orm! Thy Brother! And no nearer? O 'tis sad That here, like dumb Beasts, yearning with blank eyes, Wringing each other's hands, pale, passionate, Full of immortal likeness, wild with thirst To mingle, yet we here must stand asunder, Two human Shapes, two Mansions built apart, Two pale Men,—and two Ghosts upon the ground! Tread back my footsteps with me in thy mind: I have wander'd long and far, and O I have seen Strange visions; for my Soul resembles not The miserable souls of common men— Mere Lamps to guide the Body to the board And lustful bed—say, rather, 'tis a Wind Prison'd in flesh, and shrieking to be free To blow on the high places of the Lord! Hither and hither hath its pent-up struggle Compelled my footsteps—o'er the snowy Steeps, Through the green Valleys—into huts of hinds And palaces of princes. It hath raved Loud as the wind among the pines for rest, Answered by all the winds of all the world Gather'd like howling wolves beneath the Moon; And it hath lain still as the air that broods On meres Coruisken on dead days of frost, In supreme moments of unearthly bliss, Feeling the pathos and exceeding peace Of thoughts as delicate and far removed As starlight. But in stormy times and calm, In pain or pleasure, came the Shadow too, Meeting the Soul in its superbest hour, And making it afraid. These twain have dwelt Together, haunting one another's bliss,— The Wind, that would be on the extremest peaks, And the strange Shadow of the prisonhouse, Wherein 'tis pent so very cunningly. Nay, how they mock each other! ‘Shade accursed,’ The Wind moans, ‘yet a little while, and thou Shalt perish with the poor and mean abode That casts thee—follow and admonish that,— To me thine admonition promiseth The crumbling of the ruin chain'd wherein I cry for perfect freedom.’ Then methinks The wild Shade waves its arms grotesque and says, In dumb show, ‘Peace, thou unsubstantial Wind! Bred of the peevish humour of the flesh, Born in the body and the cells o' the brain; With these things shalt thou perish,—foul as gas Thou senseless shalt dissolve upon the air, And none shall know that thou hast ever been.’ Thus have they mock'd each other morn and mirk In speech not human. When I lay at night, Drunk with the ichor of the form I clasp'd, How hath the sad Soul, mocking the brute bliss, The radiant glistening play o' the sense, withdrawn Unto the innermost chamber of the brain, And moan'd in shame; while in the taper light, The Shades, with clasping arms and waving hair, Seem'd saying, ‘Gather roses while thou mayst, O royal purple Body doom'd to die! And hush, O Wind, for thou shalt perish too!’ I saw a Hind at sunrise—dumb he stood, And saw the Dawn press with her rosy feet The dewy sweetness from the fields of hay, Felt the World brighten—leaves and flowers and grass Grow luminous—yet beside the pool he stood, Wherein, in the gray vapour of the marsh, His mottled oxen stood with large blank eyes And steaming nostrils: and his eyes like theirs Were empty, and he humm'd a surly song Out of a hollow heart akin to beast's: Yea, sun nor star had little joy for him, Nor tree nor flower,—to him the world was all Mere matter for a ploughshare. On the hill Above him, with loose jerkin backward blown By winds of morning, and his white brow bare Like marble, stood a Singer—one of those Who write in heart's-blood what is blotted out With ox-gall; and his Soul was in his eyes To see the coming of the beautiful Day, His lips hung heavy with beauty, and he looked Down on the surly clod among the kine, And sent his Soul unto him through his eyes, Transfiguring him with beauty and with praise Into the common pathos. Of such stuffs Is mankind shapen, both, like thee and me, Wear westward, to the melancholy Realm Where all the gather'd Shades of all the world Lie as a cloud around the feet of God. This darkens all my seeking. O my friend! If the whole world had royal eyes like thine, I were much holpen; but to look upon Eyes like the ox-herd's, blank as very beast's, Shoots sorrow to the very roots of life. Aye! there were hope indeed if each Man seemed A Spirit's habitation,—but the world Is curst with these blank faces, still as stone, And darkening inward. Have these dumb things Souls? If they be tenantless, dare thou and I Christen by so sublime a name the Wind Bred in the wasting body? Yestermorn, In yonder city that afar away Staineth the peaceful blue with its foul breath, I passed into a dimly-lighted hall, And heard a lanthorn-jaw'd Philosopher, Clawing his straw-like bunch of yellow hair, With skeletonian periods and a voice Shrill as the grating of two bones. ‘O Soul,’ Quoth he, ‘O beauteousness we name the Soul, Thou art the Flower of all the life o' the World, And not in every clod of flesh shoots forth The perfect apparition of thy tints Immortal! Flower and scented bloom of things Thou growest on no dunghill in the sun!’ A flower, a flower immortal? How I laugh'd! Clip me the lily from its secret roots, And farewell all the wonder of the flower! That self-same day, in that same city of souls, I saw the King, a man of flesh and blood, In gorgeous raiment. O the little eyes Glimmering underneath the golden crown, While sitting on a throne in open court, Fountains of perfume sprinkling him with spray, He heard the gray men of his kingdom speak Of mighty public matters solemnly, And nodding grave approval, all the while Crack'd filberts like a Monkey; yet at times His shadow, and the shadow of his throne, Falling against a grand sarcophagus That filled one corner of the fountain'd court, Awoke a nameless trouble, and the more The sun shone, deeper on the tomb close by The double shadow linger'd. Then methought I was transported to a marvellous land, A mighty forest of primæval growth Brooding in its own darkness—underwood Breast-deep, and swarming thick with monstrous shapes; And from a bough above me, by his tail A Man-beast swung and glimmer'd down at me With little eyes and shining ivory teeth. Laugh with me! Brute-beast and the small-eyed King Seem'd brethren—face, eyes, mouth, and lips the same— Only the brute-beast was the happier, Since never nameless trouble filled his eyes, Because his ghost upon the glimmering grass Beneath him quivered, while he poised above With philosophic swing by claws and tail. ‘O Soul the Flower of all the life o' the World, O perfect Flower and scented bloom of things!’ O birth betoken'd in that windy hour, When, sloughing off the brute, we stand and groan, First frighten'd by the Shadow that has chased Our changes up through all the grooves of Time! Lift up thine eyes, old man, and look on me: Like thee, a dark point in the scheme of things, Where the dumb Spirit that pervadeth all— Grass, trees, beasts, man—and lives and grows in all— Pauses upon itself, and awe-struck feels The shadow of the next and imminent Transfiguration. So, a living Man! That entity within whose brooding brain Knowledge begins and ends—that point in time When Time becomes the Shadow of a Dial,— That dreadful living and corporeal Hour, Who, wafted by an unseen Hand apart From the wild rush of temporal things that pass, Pauses and listens,—listening sees his face Glassed in still waters of Eternity,— Gazes in awe at his own loveliness, And fears it,—glanceth with affrighted eyes Backward and forward, and beholds all dark, Alike the place whence he unconscious came, And that to which he conscious drifteth on,— Yet seeth before him, wheresoe'er he turn, The Shadow of himself, presaging doom. II. The Rainbow. THE OLD MAN SPEAKS. Mine eyes are dim. Where am I? Is this Snow Falling in the cold air? All darkeneth,— As if between me and the light there stood Some shape that lived. My God, is this the end? ORM. Not yet! not yet! Look up! Thou livest yet! 'Tis but a little faintness, and will pass. OLD MAN. Pass? All things pass. The light, the morning dew, The power that plotted and the foot that clomb; And delicate bloom of life upon the flesh Fading like peach-bloom 'neath a finger-press. O God, to blossom like a flower in a day, Then wear a winter in slow withering. . . . Why not with sun-flash, Lord, or bolt of fire? . . . Where am I? ORM. On the lonely heights of Earth; Beneath thee lies the Ocean, and above thee The Hills stand silent in the setting Sun. OLD MAN. What forms are these that come and change and go? ORM. Desolate Shadows of the gathering Rain. OLD MAN. What sound is that I hear? ORM. The homeless Wind Shivering behind the Shadows as they glide, And moaning. OLD MAN. Ah! ORM. Some phantom of the brain Appalleth thee! Cling to me! Courage! OLD MAN. Hark! Dost thou not hear? ORM. What? OLD MAN. Voices of the shapes That yonder, with their silvern robes windblown, All faint and shadowless against the light, Beckon me. Hush! They sing a lullaby! They are the spirits that so long ago Sung round my cradle,—and they sing the same,— Though I am grown the ghosts of that fair time. No! faces! These are faces I remember! A fair face that, sweet in its golden hair— And lower, see! a little pale-faced child's, Sad as a star. ‘Father!’ A voice cried ‘Father!’ Lift me up! Look! How they are gathering! All sing! All beckon! ORM. . . . 'Tis the end indeed. Within his breast the life-blood of the heart Swells like a breaking wave, as, clinging round me, He yearneth, fascinated yet afraid, With wild dim eyes that look on vacancy! OLD MAN. What gleameth yonder in the brightening air? ORM. The Spirit of the Rainbow hovering faint Amid the wind-blown shadows of the Rain. OLD MAN. Shadows! I see them—all the Shadows— see! Uprising from the wild green sea of graves That beats forlorn about the shores of earth. Shadows—behold them!—how they gather and gather, More and yet more, darker and darker yet; Drifting with a low moan of mystery Upward, still upward, till they almost touch The bright dim edge of the Bow, but there they pause, Struggling in vain against a breath from heaven, And blacken. Hark! their sound is like a Sea! Above them, with how dim a light divine, Burneth the Bow,—and lo! it is a Bridge, Dim, many-colour'd, strangely brightening, Whereon, all faint and fair and shadowless, Spirits like those, with faces I remember, With a low sound like the soft rain in spring, With a faint echo of the cradle song, Coming and going, beckon me! I come! Who holds me? Touch me not. O help! I am called! Ah! [Dies. ORM. Gone! Dead! Something very cold past by And touched my cheek like breath; even then, O God, My comrade heard Thy summons, and behold! Here lieth, void and cold and tenantless, His feeble habitation. Poor gray hairs, Thin with long blowing in the windy cold, At last ye sadden ruin! poor sweet lips, Ye are dewless, ye are silent! poor worn heart, No more shalt thou, like to a worn-out watch, Tick feebly out the time! O Shadow sad, Monitor, haunter, waiter till the end, Brother of that which darkeneth at my feet, Hast thou too fled, and dost thou follow still The Spirit's quest divine? Nay, thou dark Ghost! Thy work is done for ever—thou art doom'd— A breath from heaven holds thee to the ground; And here unto the ruin thou art chained, Moveless, and dark, no more the ghost of life, But dead, the Shadow of a thing of stone. Thus far, no further, Shadow!—but, O brother, O Spirit, where art thou? From what far height Up yonder, pausing for a moment's space, Lookest thou back thy blessing? Art thou free? Dost thou still hunger upward seeking rest, Because some new horizon, strange as ours, Shuts out the prospect of the place of peace? Art thou a wave that, having broken once, Gatherest up a glorious crest once more, And glimmerest onward,—but to break again; Or dost thou smooth thyself to perfect peace In tranquil sight of some Eternal Shore? From the still region whither thou hast fled, No answer cometh; but with dewy wings Brightening before it dieth, how divine Burneth the Rainbow, at its earthliest edge Now fading like a flower! Is it indeed A Bridge whereon fair Spirits come and go? O Brother, didst thou glide to peace that way? Silent—all silent—dimmer, dimmer yet, Hue by hue dying, creeping back to heaven— O let me too pass by it up to God! Too late—it fadeth, faint and far away! The Shadows gather round me—from the ground My dark familiar looketh silently. O Shadows, be at peace, for ye shall rest, Yea, surely ye shall cease; for now, as ever, Out of your cloudy being springs serene The Bow of Mystery that spans the globe! The beautiful Bow of thoughts ineffable, Last consequence of this fair cloud of flesh! The dim miraculous Iris of sweet Dream! Rainbow of promise! Colour, Light, and Soul! That comes, dies, comes again, and ever draws Its strangest source from tears—that lives, that dies— That is, is not—now here, now faded wholly— Ever assuring, ever blessing us, Ever eluding, ever beckoning; Born of our essence, yet more strange than we, As human, yet more beautiful tenfold,— Rising in earth out of our cloudy being, Touching forlornest places with its tints, Strewing the Sea with opal, scattering roses Across the hollow pathways of the Wind, Fringing the clouds with flowers of crimson fire, And melting, melting (whither our wild eyes Follow imploring, whither our weak feet Totter for ever), melting far away, Yonder! upon the dimmest peak of Heaven! III. SONGS OF CORRUPTION. Songs of Corruption, woven thus, With tender thoughts and tremulous, Sitting with a solemn face In an island burying-place, While weary waves broke sad and slow O'er weedy wastes of sand below, And stretch'd on every side of me The rainy grief of the gray Sea. I. Phantasy. If thou art an Angel, Who hath seen thee, O Phantasy, brooding Over my pale wife's sleeping? In the darkness I am listening For the rustle of thy robe; Would I might feel thee breathing, Would I might hear thee speaking, Would I might only touch thee By the hand! She is very cold, My wife is very cold, Her eyes are withered, Her breath is dried like dew;— The sound of my weeping Disturbeth her not; Thy shadow, O Phantasy, Lieth like moonlight Upon her features, And the lines of her mouth Are very sweet. In the night I heard my pale wife moaning, Yet did not know What made her afraid. My pale wife said, ‘I am very cold,’ And shrank away from thee, Though I saw thee not; And she kissed me and went to sleep, And gave a little start upon my arm When on her living lips Thy freezing finger was laid. What art thou— Art thou God's Angel? Or art thou only The chilly night-wind, Stealing downward From the regions where the sun Dwelleth alone with his shadow On a waste of snow? Art thou the water or earth? Or art thou the fatal air? Or art thou only An apparition Made by the mist Of mine own eyes weeping? She is very cold, My wife is very cold! I will kiss her, And the silver-haired mother will kiss her, And the little children will kiss her; And then we will wrap her warm, And hide her in a hollow space; And the house will be empty Of thee, O Phantasy, Cast on the unhappy household By the strange white clay. Much I marvel, O Phantasy, That one so gentle. So sweet, when living, Should cast a Shadow as vast as thine; For, lo! thou loomest Upward and heavenward, Hiding the sunlight Blackening the snow, And the pointing of thy finger Fadeth far away On the sunset-tinged edges, Where Man's company ends, And God's loneliness begins. II. The Dream of the World without Death. Now, sitting by her side, worn out with weeping, Behold, I fell to sleep, and had a vision, Wherein I heard a wondrous Voice intoning: Crying aloud, ‘The Master on His throne Openeth now the seventh seal of wonder, And beckoneth back the angel men name Death. And at His feet the mighty Angel kneeleth, Breathing not; and the Lord doth look upon him, Saying, ‘Thy wanderings on earth are ended.’ And lo! the mighty Shadow sitteth idle Even at the silver gates of heaven, Drowsily looking in on quiet waters, And puts his silence among men no longer. The world was very quiet. Men in traffic Cast looks over their shoulders; pallid seamen Shivered to walk upon the decks alone; And women barred their doors with bars of iron, In the silence of the night; and at the sunrise Trembled behind the husbandmen afield. I could not see a kirkyard near or far; I thirsted for a green grave, and my vision Was weary for the white gleam of a tombstone. But hearkening dumbly, ever and anon I heard a cry out of a human dwelling, And felt the cold wind of a lost one's going. One struck a brother fiercely, and he fell, And faded in a darkness; and that other Tore his hair, and was afraid, and could not perish. One struck his aged mother on the mouth, And she vanished with a gray grief from his hearthstone. One melted from her bairn, and on the ground With sweet unconscious eyes the bairn lay smiling. And many made a weeping among mountains, And hid themselves in caverns, and were drunken. I heard a voice from out the beauteous earth, Whose side rolled up from winter into summer, Crying, ‘I am grievous for my children.’ I heard a voice from out the hoary ocean, Crying, ‘Burial in the breast of me were better, Yea, burial in the salt flags and green crystals.’ I heard a voice from out the hollow ether, Saying, ‘The thing ye cursed hath been abolished— Corruption, and decay, and dissolution!’ And the world shrieked, and the summertime was bitter, And men and women feared the air behind them; And for lack of its green graves the world was hateful. Now at the bottom of a snowy mountain I came upon a woman thin with sorrow, Whose voice was like the crying of a seagull. Saying, ‘O Angel of the Lord, come hither, And bring me him I seek for on thy bosom, That I may close his eyelids and embrace him. ‘I curse thee that I cannot look upon him! I curse thee that I know not he is sleeping! Yet know that he has vanished upon God! ‘I laid my little girl upon a wood-bier, And very sweet she seemed, and near unto me; And slipping flowers into her shroud was comfort. ‘I put my silver mother in the darkness, And kissed her, and was solaced by her kisses, And set a stone, to mark the place, above her. ‘And green, green were their quiet sleeping-places, So green that it was pleasant to remember That I and my tall man would sleep beside them. ‘The closing of dead eyelids is not dreadful, For comfort comes upon us when we close them, And tears fall, and our sorrow grows familiar; ‘And we can sit above them where they slumber, And spin a dreamy pain into a sweetness, And know indeed that we are very near them. ‘But to reach out empty arms is surely dreadful, And to feel the hollow empty world is awful, And bitter grow the silence and the distance. ‘There is no space for grieving or for weeping; No touch, no cold, no agony to strive with, And nothing but a horror and a blankness!’ Now behold I saw a woman in a mud-hut Raking the white spent embers with her fingers, And fouling her bright hair with the white ashes, Her mouth was very bitter with the ashes; Her eyes with dust were blinded; and her sorrow Sobbed in the throat of her like gurgling water. And all around the voiceless hills were hoary, But red light scorched their edges; and above her There was a soundless trouble of the vapours. ‘Whither, and O whither,’ said the woman, ‘O Spirit of the Lord, hast Thou conveyed them, My little ones, my little son and daughter? ‘For, lo! we wandered forth at early morning, And winds were blowing round us, and their mouths Blew rose-buds to the rose-buds, and their eyes ‘Looked violets at the violets, and their hair Made sunshine in the sunshine, and their passing Left a pleasure in the dewy leaves behind them; ‘And suddenly my little son looked upward, And his eyes were dried like dew-drops; and his going Was like a blow of fire upon my face. ‘And my little son was gone. My little daughter Looked round me for him, clinging to my vesture; But the Lord had drawn him from me, and I knew it ‘By the sign He gives the stricken, that the lost one Lingers nowhere on the earth, on hill or valley, Neither underneath the grasses nor the tree-roots. ‘And my shriek was like the splitting of an ice-reef, And I sank among my hair, and all my palm Was moist and warm where the little hand had filled it. ‘Then I fled and sought him wildly, hither and thither— Though I knew that he was stricken from me wholly By the token that the Spirit gives the stricken. ‘I sought him in the sunlight and the starlight, I sought him in great forests, and in waters Where I saw mine own pale image looking at me. ‘And I forgot my little bright-haired daughter, Though her voice was like a wild-bird's far behind me, Till the voice ceased, and the universe was silent. ‘And stilly, in the starlight, came I backward To the forest where I missed him; and no voices Brake the stillness as I stooped down in the starlight, ‘And saw two little shoes filled up with dew, And no mark of little footsteps any farther, And knew my little daughter had gone also.’ But beasts died; yea, the cattle in the yoke, The milk-cow in the meadow, and the sheep, And the dog upon the doorstep: and men envied. And birds died; yea, the eagle at the sungate, The swan upon the waters, and the farmfowl, And the swallows on the housetops: and men envied. And reptiles; yea, the toad upon the roadside, The slimy, speckled snake among the grass, The lizard on the ruin: and men envied. The dog in lonely places cried not over The body of his master; but it missed him, And whined into the air, and died, and rotted. The traveller's horse lay swollen in the pathway, And the blue fly fed upon it; but no traveller Was there; nay, not his footprint on the ground. The cat mewed in the midnight, and the blind Gave a rustle, and the lamp burnt blue and faint, And the father's bed was empty in the morning. The mother fell to sleep beside the cradle, Rocking it, while she slumbered, with her foot, And wakened,—and the cradle there was empty. I saw a two-years' child, and he was playing; And he found a dead white bird upon the doorway, And laughed, and ran to show it to his mother. The mother moaned, and clutched him, and was bitter, And flung the dead white bird across the threshold; And another white bird flitted round and round it, And uttered a sharp cry, and twittered and twittered, And lit beside its dead mate, and grew busy, Strewing it over with green leaves and yellow. So far, so far to seek for were the limits Of affliction; and men's terror grew a homeless Terror, yea, and a fatal sense of blankness. There was no little token of distraction, There was no visible presence of bereavement, Such as the mourner easeth out his heart on. There was no comfort in the slow farewell, Nor gentle shutting of belovëd eyes, Nor beautiful broodings over sleeping features. There were no kisses on familiar faces, No weaving of white grave-clothes, no last pondering Over the still wax cheeks and folded fingers. There was no putting tokens under pillows, There was no dreadful beauty slowly fading, Fading like moonlight softly into darkness. There were no churchyard paths to walk on, thinking How near the well-beloved ones are lying. There were no sweet green graves to sit and muse on, Till grief should grow a summer meditation, The shadow of the passing of an angel, And slepping should seem easy, and not cruel. Nothing but wondrous parting and a blankness. But I awoke, and, lo! the burthen was uplifted, And I prayed within the chamber where she slumbered, And my tears flowed fast and free, but were not bitter. I eased my heart three days by watching near her, And made her pillow sweet with scent and flowers, And could bear at last to put her in the darkness. And I heard the kirk-bells ringing very slowly, And the priests were in their vestments, and the earth Dripped awful on the hard wood, yet I bore it. And I cried, ‘O unseen Sender of Corrup tion, I bless Thee for the wonder of Thy mercy, Which softeneth the mystery and the parting. ‘I bless Thee for the change and for the comfort, The bloomless face, shut eyes, and waxen fingers,— For Sleeping, and for Silence, and Corruption.’ III. Soul and Flesh. My Soul, thou art wed To a perishable thing, But death from thy strange mate Shall sever thee full soon, If thou wilt reap wings Take all the Flesh can give: The touch of the smelling dead, The kiss of the maiden's mouth, The sorrow, the hope, the fear, That floweth along the veins: Take all, nor be afraid; Cling close to thy mortal Mate! So shalt thou duly wring Out of thy long embrace The hunger and thirst whereof The Master maketh thee wings,— The beautiful, wondrous yearning, The mighty thirst to endure. Be not afraid, my Soul, To leave thy Mate at last, Thou ye shall learn in time To love each other well; But put her gently down In the earth beneath thy feet. And dry thine eyes and hasten To the imperishable springs; And it shall be well for thee In the beautiful Master's sight, If it be found in the end Thou hast used her tenderly. IV. THE SOUL AND THE DWELLING. A House miraculous of breath The royal Soul inhabiteth. Alone therein for evermore, It seeks in vain to pass the door; But through the windows of the eyne Signalleth to its kin divine. ... This is a song Orm sang of old To Oona with the locks of gold. Come to me! clasp me! Spirit to spirit! Bosom to bosom! Tenderly, clingingly, Mingle to one! . . . Now, from my kisses Withdrawing, and blushing, Why dost thou gaze on me? Why dost thou weep? Why dost thou cling to me, Imploring, adoring? What are those meanings That flash from thine eyes? Pitiful! pitiful! Now I conceive thee!— Yea, it were easier Striking two swords, To weld them together, Than spirit with spirit To mingle, though rapture Be perfect as this. Shut in a tremulous Prison, each spirit Hungers and yearns— Never, ah never, Belovëd, belovëd, Have these eyes look'd on The face of thy Soul. Ours are two dwellings, Wondrously beautiful, Made in the darkness Of soft-tinted flesh: In the one dwelling, Prison'd I dwell, And lo! from the other Thou beckonest me! I am a Soul! Thou art a Soul! These are our dwellings! O to be free! Beauteous, belovëd, Is thy dear dwelling; All o'er it blowing The roses of dawn— Bright is the portal, The dwelling is scented Within and without; Strange are the windows, So clouded with azure, The faces are hidden That look from within. Now I approach thee, Sweetness and odour Tremble upon me— Wild is the rapture! Thick is the perfume! Sweet bursts of music Thrill from within! Closer, yet closer! Bosom to bosom! Tenderly, clingingly, Mingle to one. ... Ah! but what faces Are those that look forth! ... Faces? What faces? As I speak they die And all my gaze is empty as of old. O love! the world was fair, and everywhere Rose wondrous human dwellings like mine own, And many of these were foul and dark with dust, Haunted by things obscene, not beautiful, But most were very royal, meet to serve Angels for habitation. All alone Brooded my Soul by a mysterious fire Dim-burning, never-dying, from the first Lit in the place by God; the winds and rains Struck on the abode and spared it; day and night Above it came and went; and in the night My Soul gazed from the threshold silently, And saw the congregated lamps that swung Above it in the dark and dreamy blue; And in the day my Soul gazed on the earth, And sought the dwellings there for signs, and lo! None answer'd; for the Souls inhabitant Drew coldly back and darken'd; and I said, ‘In all the habitations I behold, Some old, some young, some fair, and some not fair, There dwells no Soul I know.’ But as I spake, I saw beside me in a dreamy light Thy habitation, so serene and fair, So stately in a rosy dawn of day, That all my Soul look'd forth and cried, ‘Behold, The sweetest dwelling in the whole wide world!’ And thought not of the inmate, but gazed on, Lingeringly, hushfully; for as I gazed Something came glistening up into thine eyes, And beckon'd, and a murmur from the portal, A murmur and a perfume, floated hither, Thrill'd through my dwelling, making every chamber Tremble with mystical, Dazzling desire! ... Come to me! close to me! Bosom to bosom! Tenderly, clingingly, Mingle to one! Wildly within me Some eager inmate Rushes and trembles, Peers from the eyes And calls in the ears, Yearns to thee, cries to thee! Claiming old kinship In lives far removed! . . Vainly, ah vainly! Pent in its prison Must each miraculous Spirit remain,— Yet inarticulate, Striving to language Music and memory, Rapture and dream! Rapture and dream! Belovëd one, in vain My spirit seeks for utterance. Alas, Not yet shall there be speech. Not yet, not yet, One dweller in a mortal tenement Can know what secret faces hide away Within the neighbouring dwelling. Ah beloved, The mystery, the mystery! We cry For God's face, who have never looked upon The poorest Soul's face in the wonderful Soul-haunted world. A spirit once there dwelt Beside me, close as thou—two wedded souls, We mingled—flesh was mixed with flesh—we knew All joys, all unreserves of mingled life— Yea, not a sunbeam filled the house of one But touched the other's threshold. Hear me swear I never knew that Soul! All touch, all sound, All light was insufficient. The Soul, pent In its strange chambers, cried to mine in vain— We saw each other not: but oftentimes When I was glad, the windows of my neighbour Were dark and drawn, as for a funeral; And sometimes, when, most weary of the world, My Soul was looking forth at dead of night, I saw the neighbouring dwelling brightly lit, The happy windows flooded full of light, As if a feast were being held within. Yet were there passing flashes, random gleams, Low sounds, from the inhabitant divine I knew not; and I shrunk from some of these In a mysterious pain. At last, Belovëd, The frail fair mansion where that spirit dwelt Totter'd and trembled, through the wondrous flesh A dim sick glimmer from the fire within Grew fainter, fainter. ‘I am going away,’ The Spirit seemed to cry; and as it cried, Stood still and dim and very beautiful Up in the windows of the eyes—there linger'd, First seen, last seen, a moment, silently So different, more beautiful tenfold Than all that I had dreamed—I sobbed aloud ‘Stay! stay!’ but at the one despairing word The spirit faded, from the hearth within The dim fire died with one last quivering gleam— The house became a ruin; and I moaned ‘God help me! 'twas herself that look'd at me! First seen! I never knew her face before! .. Too late! too late! too late!’ ... Yea, from my forehead Kiss the dark fantasy! Tenderly, clingingly, Mingle to one! Is not this language? Music and memory, Rapture and dream?— O in the dewy-bright Day-dawn of love, Is it not wondrous, Blush-red with roses, The beautiful, mystical House of the Soul! Lo in my innermost Chambers is floating Soft perfume and music That tremble from thee. ... Ah, but what faces Are these, that look forth? Sit, still, Belovëd, while I search thy looks For memories. O thou art beautiful! Crownëd with silken gold,—soft amber tints Coming and going on thy peach-hued flesh,— Thy breath a perfume,—thy blue eyes twain stars— Thy lips like dewy rosebuds to the eye, Though living to the touch. O royal abode, Flooded with music, light, and precious scent, Curtainëd soft with subtle mystery! Nay, stir not, but gaze on, still and serene, Possessing me with thy superb still sweep Of eyes ineffable—sit still, my queen, And let me, clinging on thee, court the ways Wherein I know thee. Nay, even now, Belovëd, When all the world like some vast tidal wave Withdraws and leaves us on a golden shore Alone together—when thou most art mine— When the winds blow for us, and the soft stars Are shining for us, where we dream apart,— Now our two dwellings in a dizzy hour Have mingled their foundations—clinging thus And hungering round me in mine ecstasy,— Belovëd, do I know thee? Hath my Soul Spoken to thine the imperial speech of Souls, Perfect in meaning and in melody? Tell me, Belovëd, while thou sittest so, Mine own, my queen, my palace of delights, What lights are these that pass and come again Within thee? Is the Spirit looking forth, Or is it but the glittering gleams of time Playing on vacant windows? Can I swear Thou thinkest of me now at all? Behold Now all thy beauty is suffused with brightness— Thou blushest and thou smilest. Tell me true, Thou then wast far within, and with that cry I woke thee out of dream. O speak to me!— Soul's speech, Belovëd! Do not smile that way— A flood of brightness issues from thy door, But mine is scarcely bright. Lovest thou me, Belovëd, my belovëd? Soul belovëd, Do I possess thee? Sight and scent and touch Are insufficient. Open! let me in To the strange chambers I have never seen! Heart of the rose, unopen! or I die! V. SONGS OF SEEKING. Songs of Seeking, day by day Sung while wearying on the way,— Feeble cries of one who knows Nor whence he comes, nor whither goes. Yet of his own free will doth wear The bloody Cross of those who fare Upward and on in sad accord,— The footsore Seekers of the Lord. I. O thou whose ears incline unto my singing, Woman or man, thou surely bearest thy burden, And I who sing, and all men, bear their burdens. Even as a meteor-stone from suns afar, I fell unto the ways of life and breathed, Wherefore to much on earth I feel a stranger. I found myself in a green norland valley, A place of gleaming waters and gray heavens, And weirdly woven colours in the air. A basin round whose margin rose the mountains Green-based, snow-crown'd, and windy saeters midway, And the thin line of a spire against the mountains. Around were homes of peasants rude and holy, Who look'd upon the mountains and the forests, On the waters, on the vapours, without wonder; Who, happy in their labours six days weekly, Were happy on their knees upon the seventh. But I wonder'd, being strange, and was not happy. For I cried: ‘O Thou Unseen, how shall I praise Thee— How shall I name Thee glorious whom I know not— If Thou art as these say, I scarce conceive Thee. ‘Unfold to me the image of Thy features, Come down upon my heart, that I may know Thee;’— And I made a song of seeking, on a mountain. II. Quest. As in the snowy stillness, Where the stars shine greenly In a mirror of ice, The Reindeer abideth alone, And speedeth swiftly From her following shadow In the moon,— I speed for ever From the mystic shape That my life projects, And my Soul perceives; And I loom for ever Through desolate regions Of wondrous thought, And I fear the thing That follows me, And cannot escape it Night or day. Doth Thy wingëd lightning Strike, O Master! The timid Reindeer Flying her shade? Will Thy wrath pursue me, Because I cannot Escape the shadow Of the thing I am? I have pried and pondered, I have agonised, I have sought to find Thee, Yet still must roam, Affrighted, fleeing Thee, Chased by the shadow Of the thing I am, Through desolate regions Of wondrous thought! III. The Happy Earth. Sweet, sweet it was to sit in leafy Forests, In a green darkness, and to hear the stirring Of strange breaths hither and thither in the branches; And sweet it was to sail on crystal Waters, Between the dome above and the dome under, The Hills above me and the Hills beneath me; And sweet it was to watch the wondrous Lightning Spring flashing at the earth, and slowly perish Under the falling of the summer Rain. I loved all grand and gentle and strange things,— The wind-flower at the tree-root, and the white cloud, The strength of Mountains, and the power of Waters. And unto me all seasons utter'd pleasure: Spring, standing startled, listening to the skylark, The wild flowers from her lap unheeded falling; And Summer, in her gorgeous loose apparel, And Autumn, with her dreamy drooping lashes; And Winter, with his white hair blown about him. Yea, everywhere there stirred a deathless beauty, A gleaming and a flashing into change, An under-stream of sober consecration. Yet nought endured, but all the glory faded, And power and joy and sorrow were interwoven; There was no single presence of the Spirit. IV. O Unseen One! Because Thou art beautiful, Because Thou art mysterious, Because Thou art strong, Or because Thou art pitiless, Shall my Soul worship Thee, O Thou Unseen One? As men bow to monarchs, As slaves to their owners, Shall I bow to Thee? As one that is fearful, As one that is slavish, Shall I pray to Thee? Wert Thou a demigod, Wert Thou an angel, Lip-worship might serve; To Thee, most beautiful, Wondrous, mysterious, How shall it avail? Thou art not a demigod, Thou art not a monarch,— Why should I bow to Thee? I am not fearful, I am not slavish,— Why should I pray to Thee? O Spirit of Mountains! Strong Master of Waters! Strange Shaper of Clouds! When these things worship Thee I too will worship Thee, O Maker of Men! V. World's Mystery. The World was wondrous round me— God's green World— A World of gleaming waters and green places, And weirdly woven colours in the air. Yet evermore a trouble did pursue me— A hunger for the wherefore of my being, A wonder from what regions I had fallen. I gladdened in the glad things of the World, Yet crying always, ‘Wherefore, and oh, wherefore? What am I? Wherefore doth the World seem happy?’ I saddened in the sad things of the World, Yet crying, ‘Wherefore are men bruised and beaten? Whence do I grieve and gladden to no end?’ VI. The Cities. I took my staff and wandered o'er the mountains, And came among the heaps of gold and silver, The gorgeous desolation of the Cities. My trouble grew tenfold when I beheld The agony and burden of my fellows, The pains of sick men and the groans of hungry. I saw the good man tear his hair and weep; I saw the bad man tread on human necks Prospering and blaspheming: and I wondered. The silken-natured woman was a bondslave; The gross man foul'd her likeness in high places; The innocent were heart-wrung: and I wondered. The gifts of earth are given to the base; The monster of the Cities spurned the martyr; The martyr died, denying: and I wondered. VII. The Priests. Three Priests in divers vestments passed and whispered: ‘Worship the one God, stranger, or thou diest; Yea, worship, or thy tortures shall be endless.’ I cried, ‘Which God, O wise ones, must I worship?’ And neither answer'd, but one showed a Picture, A fair Man dying on a Cross of wood. And this one said, ‘The others err, O stranger! Repent, and love thy brother,—'tis enough! The Doom of Dooms is only for the wicked.’ I turned and cried unto him, ‘Who is wicked?’ He vanish'd, and within a house beside me I heard a hard man bless his little children. My heart was full of comfort for the wicked, Mine eyes were cleared with love, and everywhere The wicked wore a piteousness like starlight. I felt my spirit foul with misconceivings, I thought of old transgressions and was humble; I cried, ‘O God, whose doom is on the wicked! ‘Thou art not He for whom my being hungers! The Spirit of the grand things and the gentle, The strength of mountains and the power of waters!’ And lo! that very night I had a Vision. VIII. The Lamb of God. 1 I saw in a vision of the night The Lamb of God, and it was white; White as snow it wander'd through Silent fields of harebell-blue, Still it wandering fed, and sweet Flower'd the stars around its feet. 2 I heard in vision a strange voice Cry aloud, ‘Rejoice! rejoice! Dead men rise and come away, Now it is the Judgment Day!’ And I heard the host intone Round the footstool of the Throne. 3 Then the vision pained my sight, All I saw became so bright— All the Souls of men were there, All the Angels of the air; God was smiling on His seat, And the Lamb was at His feet. 4 Then I heard a voice—‘'Tis done! Blest be those whom God hath won!’ And the loud hosannah grew, And the golden trumpets blew, And around the place of rest Rose the bright mist of the Blest. 5 Then suddenly I saw again, Bleating like a thing in pain, The Lamb of God;— and all in fear Gazed and cried as it came near, For on its robe of holy white Crimson blood-stains glimmer'd bright. 6 O the vision of the night; The Lamb of God! the blood-stains bright! In quiet waters of the skies It bathed itself with piteous eyes— Vainly on its raiment fell Cleansing dews ineffable! 7 All the while it cried for pain, It could not wash away the stain— All the gentle blissful sky Felt the trouble of its cry— All the streams of silver sheen Sought in vain to make it clean. 8 Where'er it went along the skies The Happy turned away their eyes; Where'er it past from shore to shore All wept for those whose blood it bore— Its piteous cry filled all the air, Till the Dream was more than I could bear. 9 And in the darkness of my bed Weeping I awakenëd— In the silence of the night, Dying softly from my sight, Melted that pale Dream of pain Like a snow-flake from thy brain. IX. Doom. Master, if there be Doom, All men are bereaven! If, in the universe, One Spirit receive the curse, Alas for Heaven! If there be Doom for one, Thou, Master, art undone. Were I a Soul in heaven, Afar from pain, Yea, on Thy breast of snow, At the scream of one below I should scream again. Art Thou less piteous than The conception of a Man? X. God's Dream. I hear a voice, ‘How should God pardon sin? How should He save the sinner with the sinless? That would be ill: the Lord my God is just.’ Further I hear, ‘How should God pardon lust? How should He comfort the adulteress? That would be foul: the Lord my God is pure.’ Further I hear, ‘How should God pardon blood? How should the murtherer have a place in heaven Beside the innocent life he took away?’ And God is on His throne; and in a dream Sees mortals making figures out of clay, Shapen like men, and calling them God's angels. And sees the shapes look up into His eyes, Exclaiming, ‘Thou didst ill to save this man; Damn Thou this woman, and curse this cut-throat, Lord!’ God dreams this, and His dreaming is the world; And thou and I are dreams within His dream; And nothing dieth God hath dreamt or thought. XI. Flower of the World. Wherever men sinned and wept, I wandered in my quest; At last in a Garden of God I saw the Flower of the World. This Flower had human eyes, Its breath was the breath of the mouth; Sunlight and starlight came, And the Flower drank bliss from both. Whatever was base and unclean, Whatever was sad and strange, Was piled around its roots; It drew its strength from the same. Whatever was formless and base Pass'd into fineness and form; Whatever was lifeless and mean Grew into beautiful bloom. Then I thought, ‘O Flower of the World, Miraculous Blossom of things, Light as a faint wreath of snow Thou tremblest to fall in the wind. ‘O beautiful Flower of the World, Fall not nor wither away; He is coming—He cannot be far— The Lord of the Flow'rs and the Stars. And I cried, ‘O Spirit divine! That walkest the Garden unseen, Come hither, and bless, ere it dies, The beautiful Flower of the World.’ XII. O Spirit! Weary with seeking, weary with long waiting, I fell upon my knees, and wept, exclaiming, ‘O Spirit of the grand things and the gentle! ‘Thou hidest from our seeking—Thou art crafty— Thou wilt not let our hearts admit Thee wholly— Believing hath a core of unbelieving— ‘A coward dare not look upon Thy features, But museth in a cloud of misconceiving; The bravest man's conception is a coward's. ‘Wherefore, O wherefore, art Thou veil'd and hidden? The world were well, and wickedness were over, If Thou upon Thy throne were one thing certain.’ And lo! that very night I had a Vision. VI. THE LIFTING OF THE VEIL. Thou who the Face Divine wouldst see, Think,—couldst thou bear the sight, and be? O waves of life and thought and dream, Darkening in one mysterious Stream, Flow on, flow loudly; nor become A glassy Mirror sad and dumb, Whereon for evermore might shine The dread peace of the Face Divine!— Children of earth whose spirits fail, Beware the Lifting of the Veil! I. Orm's Vision. My Soul had a vision, And in my Soul's vision The Veil was lifted, And the Face was there! There was no portent Of fire or thunder, The wind was sleeping, Above and under All things lookt fair. And the change came softly Unaware: On a golden morrow The Veil was lifted, And yea! the ineffable Face was there. My Soul saw the vision From a silent spot— Nay, of its likeness Ask me not— How should my Soul fathom The formless features? Gaze at the Master How should it dare? Only I flutter'd To my knees and mutter'd A moan, a prayer— Silent, ineffable, Gazing downward, The Face was there! This let me whisper: It stirred not, changed not, Though the world stood still, amazed; But the Eyes within it, Like the eyes of a painted picture, Met and followed The eyes of each that gazed. II. The Face and the World. Then my Soul heard a voice Crying—‘Wander forth O'er hill and valley, O'er the earth— Behold the mortals How they fare— Now the great Father Grants their prayer; Now every spirit Of mortal race, Since the Veil is lifted, Beholds the Face! I awoke my body, And up the mountains, With the sweet sun shining I wander'd free— And the hills were pleasant, Knee-deep in heather, And the yellow eagle Wheel'd over me— And the streams were flowing, And the lambs were leaping Merrily! But on the hill-tops The shepherds gather'd, Up-gazing dreamily Into the silent air, And close beside them The eagle butcher'd The crying lambkin, But they did not see, nor care. I saw the white flocks of the shepherds, Like snow wind-lifted and driven, Blow by, blow by! And the terrible wolves behind them, As wild as the winds, pursuing With a rush and a tramp and a cry! I passed the places Of ice and snow, And I saw a Hunter Lying frozen,— His eyes were sealëd— He did not know; Drinking his heart's-blood, Not looking upward, Sat the soot-black raven And the corby crow. Then I knew they linger'd, Though the Veil was lifted, Death and Decay, And my Spirit was heavy As I turned away; But my Spirit was brighter As I saw below me The glassy Ocean Glimmering, With a white sail dipping Against the azure Like a sea-bird's wing— And all look'd pleasant, On sea and land, The white cloud brooding, And the white sail dipping, And the village sitting On the yellow sand. And beside the waters My Soul saw the fishers Staring upward, With dumb desire, Though a mile to seaward, With the gulls pursuing, Shot past the herring With a trail like fire; Though the mighty Sea-snake With her young was stranded In the fatal shallows Of the shingly bay— Though their bellies hunger'd— What cared they? Hard by I noted Little children, Toddling and playing In a field o' hay— The Face was looking, But they were gazing At one another, And what cared they? But one I noted, A little Maiden, Look'd up o' sudden And ceased her play, And she dropt her garland And stood upgazing, With hair like sunlight, And face like clay. All was most quiet In the air, Save the children's voices And the cry of dumb beasts,— 'Twas a weary Sabbath Everywhere— Each soul an eyeball, Each face a stare;— And I left the place, And I wander'd free, And the Eyes of the Face Still followed me! At the good Priest's cottage The gray-hair'd grandsire Lay stiff in the garden— For his Soul had fled— And I cried in passing, ‘Oh ye within there, Come forth in sorrow And bury your dead.’ With his flock around him Praying bareheaded, The pale Priest, kneeling All gaunt and gray, Answer'd, ‘Look upward! Leave the dead to heaven! God is yonder! Behold, and pray!’ I was sick at heart To hear and see, And to feel the Face Still following me, And all seemed darkening, And my heart sank down,— As I saw afar off A mighty Town— When with no warning, Slowly and softly The beautiful Face withdrew, And the whole world darken'd, And the silence deepen'd, And the Veil fell downward With a silver glimmer of dew. And I was calmer As, slowly and sweetly, Gather'd above me Mysterious Light on Light,— And weary with watching I lay and slumber'd In the mellow stillness Of the blessëd night. .. When my Soul awaken'd In the lonely place, The Veil was lifted, And, behold! the Face— And sick, heart-weary, Onward I ran, Through fields of harvest Where the wheat hung wither'd. Unreapt by man; And a ragged Idiot Went gibbering gaily Among the wheat, In moist palms rubbing The ears together; And he laugh'd, and beckon'd That I should eat. At the city gateway The Sentinels gather'd, Fearful and drunken With eyes like glass— Look up they dared not, Lest, to their terror, Some luminous Angel Of awe should pass; And my Soul passed swiftly With a prayer, And entered the City:— Still and awful Were street and square. 'Twas a piteous Sabbath Everywhere— Each soul an eyeball, Each face a stare. In pale groups gather'd The Citizens, The rich and poor men, The lords, the lepers From their loathsome dens. There was no traffic, The heart of the City Stood silently; How could they barter, How could they traffic, With the terrible Eyes to see. Nay! each man brooded On the Face alone: Each Soul was an eyeball, Each Shape was a stone; And I saw the faces, And some were glad, And some were pensive, And some were mad; But in all places, Hall, street, and lane,— 'Twas a frozen pleasure, A frozen pain. I passed the bearers Of a sable bier, They had dropped their burthen To gaze in fear; From under the trappings Of the death-cloth grand, With a ring on the finger, Glimmer'd the corpse's Decaying hand. I passed the bridal, Clad bright and gay, Frozen to marble Upon its way. Freely I wandered Everywhere— No mortal heeded The passing footstep, Palace and hovel Were free as the mountain air. Aye! softly I entered The carven court of stone, And the fountains were splashing, And the pale King sitting Upon his jewell'd throne— And before him gather'd The Frail and Sickly, The Poor and Old; And he open'd great coffers, And gave thence freely Fine gear and gold,— Saying, ‘'Tis written, Who giveth freely Shall in sooth be blessëd Twenty-fold!’ But he look'd not upward, And seem'd unconscious Of the strange Eyes watching O'er sea and land; Yet his eyelids quiver'd, And his eyes look'd sidelong, And he hid in his bosom A blood-stained hand; But the beggar people Let the gold and raiment Lie all unheeded; While with no speech. Upward they lifted Their wild pale features, For the Face was mirror'd In the eyes of each. With the Face pursuing I wandered onward, Heart-sick, heart-sore, And entered the fretted Cathedral door; And I found the people Huddled together, Hiding their faces In shame and sin, For through the painted Cathedral windows The Eyes of Wonder Were looking in! And on the Altar, The wild Priest, startled, Was gazing round him With sickly stare, And his limbs were palsied, And he moaned for mercy, More wonder-stricken Than any there. Then I fell at the Altar, And wept, and murmur'd, ‘My Soul, how fares it, This day, with thee? Art thou contented To live and see, Or were it better Not to be?’ And my pale Soul whisper'd ‘Like a band that holdest And keepeth from growing A goodly tree,— A terror hath me— I feel not, stir not— 'Twere surely better Not to be!’ Then a rush of visions Went wildly by! My Soul beheld the marble World, And the luminous Face on high. And methought, affrighted, That the mortal race Built cover'd cities To hide the Face; And gather'd their treasures Of silver and gold, And sat amid them In caverns cold; And ever nightly, When the Face of Wonder Withdrew from man, Many started, And hideous revel Of the dark began. And men no longer Knew the common sorrow, The common yearning, The common love, But each man's features Were turn'd to marble, Changelessly watching The Face above— A nameless trouble Was in the air— The heart of the World Had no pulsation— 'Twas a piteous Sabbath Everywhere! III. Orm's Awakening. I awoke. And rising, My Soul look'd forth— 'Twas the dewy darkness, And the Veil was glittering Over the earth; But afar off eastward The Dawn was glimmering, All silver pale, And slowly fading With a mystic tremor, The Lights gleam'd beautiful In the wondrous Veil Yea, Dawn came cheerily, And the hill-tops brighten'd, And the shepherds shouted, And a trumped blew, And the misty Ocean Caught silver tremors, With the brown-sail'd fish-boats Glimmering through— And the City murmur'd As I ran unto it, And my heart was merry, And my fears were few; And singing gaily The lark rose upward, Its brown wings gleaming With the morning dew! VII. THE DEVIL'S MYSTICS. A scroll antique, with weeds behung, Writ in a mystic pagan tongue, Wash'd to Orm's feet by the wan Main After long nights of wind and rain: Translating this at dead of night, The Celt beholds with dazzled sight Strange gods stalk past, and in their train, Supreme, the King of Sin and Pain. I. The Inscription Without. The Moral Law: all Evil is Defect; The limb deform'd for common use of life Defect,—but haply in the line of growth. II. The Tree of Life. The Master said: ‘I have planted the Seed of a Tree, It shall be strangely fed With white dew and with red, And the Gardeners shall be three— Regret, Hope, Memory!’ The Master smiled: For the Seed that He had set Broke presently through the mould, With a glimmer of green and gold, And the Angels' eyes were wet— Hope, Memory, Regret. The Master cried: ‘It liveth—breatheth—see! Its soft lips open wide— It looks from side to side— How strange they gleam on me, The little dim eyes of the Tree!’ The Master said: ‘After a million years, The Seed I set and fed To itself hath gatherëd All the world's smiles and tears— How mighty it appears!’ The Master said: ‘At last, at last, I see A Blossom, a Blossom o' red From the heart of the Tree is shed. Fairer it seems to be Than the Tree, or the leaves o' the Tree.’ The Master cried: ‘O Angels, that guard the Tree, A Blossom, a Blossom divine Grows on this greenwood of mine: What may this Blossom be? Name this Blossom to me!’ The Master smiled; For the Angels answered thus: ‘Our tears have nourish'd the same, We have given it a name That seemeth fit to us— We have called it Spiritus.’ The Master said: ‘This Flower no Seed shall bear But hither on a day My beautiful Child shall stray, And shall snatch it unaware, And wreath it in his hair.’ The Master smiled: ‘The Tree shall never bear— Seedless shall perish the Tree, But the Flower my Child's shall be; He will pluck the Flower and wear, Till it withers in his hair!’ III. The Seeds. When all that puzzles sense was planned, When the first seeds of being fell, In reverence bent, I stood at hand, And heard a part of the spell: ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen into power and pain!’ Shoots of the seed, I saw them grow, Green blades of vegetable sheen, They darken'd as with wind, and so The Earth's black ball grew green— ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ Then starry-bright out of the ground The firstling flowers sprang dewy-wet; I pluckt one, and it felt no wound— There was no pain as yet. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ Next in His Hand He lifted thus Bright bubbling water from the spring— And in that crystal tremulous Quicken'd a living thing. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ And suddenly! ere I was 'ware, (So fast the dreadful spell was tried), O'er Earth's green bosom everywhere Crawl'd living things, and cried. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ On every grass-blade glittering bright A shining Insect leapt and played, By every sea, on every height, A Monster cast its shade— ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ The most was lingering in the least, The least became the most anon; From plant to fish, from fish to beast, The Essence deepen'd on. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ And deeper still in subtle worth The Essence grew, from gain to gain, And subtler grew, with each new birth, The creature's power of pain. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ Paler I saw the Master grow, Faint and more faint His breathing fell, And strangely, lower and more low, He mutter'd o'er the spell: ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ Now the deep murmur of the Earth Was mingled with a painful cry, The yeanling young leapt up in mirth, But the old lay down to die. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ When standing in the perfect light I saw the first-born Mortal rise— The flower of things he stood his height With melancholy eyes. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ From all the rest he drew apart, And stood erect on the green sod, Holding his hand upon his heart, And looking up at God! ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ He stood so terrible, so dread, With right hand lifted pale and proud, God feared the thing He fashionëd, And fled into a cloud. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ And since that day He hid away Man hath not seen the Face that fled, And the wild question of that day Hath not been answerëd. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ And since that day, with cloudy face, Of His own handiwork afraid, God from His heavenly hiding-place Peers on the thing He made. ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ O Crown of things, O good and wise, O mortal Soul that would'st be free, I weep to look into thine eyes— Thou art so like to me! ‘Grow, Seed! blossom, Brain! Deepen, deepen, into pain!’ IV. Fire and Water; or, a Voice of the Flesh. ‘Two white arms, a moss pillow, A curtain o' green; Come love me, love me, Come clasp me unseen!’ As red as a rose is, I saw her arise, Fresh waked from reposes, With wild dreamy eyes. I sprang to her, clasp'd her I trembled, I prest, I drank her warm kisses, I kiss'd her white breast. With a ripple of laughter, A dazzle of spray, She melted, she melted, And glimmer'd away! Down my breast runs the water, In my heart burns the fire, My face is like crimson With shame and desire! V. Sanitas. Dreamily, on her milk-white Ass, Rideth the maiden Sanitas— With zone of gold her waist is bound, Her brows are with immortelles crown'd; Dews are falling, song-birds sing, It is a Christian evening— Lower, lower, sinks the sun, The white stars glimmer, one by one! Who sitteth musing at his door? Silas, the Leper, gaunt and hoar; Though he is curst in every limb, Full whitely Time hath snowed on him— Dews are falling, song-birds sing, It is a Christian evening— The Leper, drinking in the air, Sits like a beast, with idiot stare. How pale! how wondrous! doth she pass, The heavenly maiden Sanitas; She looketh, and she shuddereth, She passeth on with bated breath— Dews are falling, song-birds sing, It is a Christian evening— His mind is like a stagnant pool, She passeth o'er it, beautiful! Brighter, whiter, in the skies, Open innumerable eyes; The Leper looketh up and sees, His aching heart is soothed by these— Dews are falling, song-birds sing, It is a Christian evening— He looketh up with heart astir, And every Star hath eyes like her! Onward on her milk-white Ass Rideth the maiden Sanitas. The boughs are green, the grain is pearl'd, But 'tis a miserable world— Dews are falling, song-birds sing, It is a Christian evening— All o'er the blue above her, she Beholds bright spots of Leprosy. VI. The Philosophers. We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! Lo! we sit apart, Each right hand is uplifted, Each left hand holds a heart; At our feet rolls by the tumult, O'er our heads the still stars gleam— We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! We drink and dream! We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! We are worn and old, Each hath the sad forehead, Each the cup of gold. In our eyes the awe-struck Nations Look, and name us wise, and go— We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! We drink and know! We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! Silent, kingly, pure; Who is wise if we be foolish? Who, if we die, shall endure? The Bacchanals with dripping vine-leaves, Blushing meet our eyes, and haste— We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! Bitter to taste! We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! Spirits pure as snow; White star-frost is on our foreheads— We are weary, we would go. Hark! the world fades with its voices, Fades the tumult and the cry— We are the Drinkers of Hemlock! We drink and die! VII. The Devil's Prayer. Father which art in Heaven,—not here below; Be Thy name hallowëd, in that place of worth; And till Thy Kingdom cometh, and we know, Be Thy will done more tenderly on Earth; Since we must live—give us this day our bread; Forgive our stumblings—since Thou mad'st us blind; If we offend Thee, Sire, at least forgive As tenderly as we forgive our kind;— Spare us temptation,—human or divine; Deliver us from evil, now and then; The Kingdom, Power, and Glory all are Thine For ever and for evermore. Amen. VIII. Homunculus; or, the Song of Deicides. 1. Now all the mystic Lamps that shed Light on the living world are fled; Now the swart digger rinses gold, Under a starless heaven and cold; Now every God, save one, is dead, Now that last God is almost sped; Cold falls the dew, chill rise the tides, To this still Song of Deicides. 2. Homunculus! Homunculus! Not ever shalt thou conquer us! Zeus, Astaroth, Brahm, and Menú, With all the gods, white, black, and blue, Are fallen, and while I murmur thus, Strong, and more strong, Homunculus Upon a Teuton Jackass rides, Singing the Song of Deicides. 3. It seems but yesterday the dim And solitary germ of him Glimmer'd most strangely on my sense, While, with my microscope intense, I search'd a Beast's brain-cavern dark:— A germ—a gleam—a cell—a spark— Grown to Homunculus, who rides To my sad Song of Deicides. 4. Oh had I then so far foreseen, This day of doom had never been, For with a drop of fire from Hell I would have killed the feeble Cell. Too late! too late! for slow and strange He has passed the darker sphere of change, Lo! he emerges—shouts—derides, Singing the Song of Deicides! 5. Black is his raiment, top to toe, His flesh is white and warm below, All through his silent veins flow flee Hunger, and Thirst, and Venery; But in his eye a still small flame, Like the first Cell from which he came, Burns round and luminous,—as he rides To my still Song of Deicides! 6. With Obic Circle he began, Swift through the Phallic rites he ran, He watch'd until his head went round The Memphian Sphinx's stare profound; All these by turn he overcast, And suck'd the Orphic Egg at last; Now laughing low he westward strides, Singing the Song of Deicides! 7. He drives the Gods o' the north to death— The Sanctus Spiritus is breath— He plucks down Thammuz from his joy, And kneads him to a huswife's toy; He stares to shame the Afric spheres; He strikes—he overturns—he sneers— Oven the fallen Titans strides, And squeaks the Song of Deicides! 8. Homunculus! Homunculus Wretched, degenerate, impious! He will not stay, he will not speak— Another blow! another shriek! Lo! where he hacketh suddenly At the red Cross of Calvary! All darkens—faintly moan the tides— Sing low the Song of Deicides! 9. Gigantic, in a dark mist, see! Loometh the Cross of Calvary; With rayless eyes the Skeleton Quivers through all its bones thereon. Deep grows the mist, faint falls the wind, The bloodshot sun setteth behind ... A crash! a fall—The Cross he strides, Singing the Song of Deicides! 10. Now he hath conquered godhead thus, Whither will turn Homunculus? I am the only God let be— All but my fiends believe in me; (Though all the Angels deem me prince, My kith and kin I can't convince.) Christ help me now! Hither he rides, Singing my song of Deicides! 11. Silent I wait—(how stand the odds?) I am the Serpent of the Gods,— Wait!—draw the forkëd tongue in slow, Hoard up my venom for the blow. Crouch in my cave—of all the host I know he feareth me the most— Then strike and crush that thing accurst I should have stifled at the first! ... All Earth awaits! Hither he rides! Cold fall the dews, chill rise the tides, To this still Song of Deicides! IX. Roses. ‘Sad, and sweet, and wise, Here a child reposes, Dust is on his eyes, Quietly he lies,— Satan, strew Roses!’ Weeping low, creeping slow, Came the Weary-wingëd! Roses red over the dead Quietly he flingëd. ‘I am old,’ he thought, ‘And the world's day closes; Pale and fever-fraught, Sadly have I brought These blood-red Roses.’ By his side the mother came Shudderingly creeping; The Devil's and the woman's heart Bitterly were weeping. ‘Swift he came and swift he flew, Hopeless he reposes; Waiting on is weary too,— Wherefore on his grave we strew Bitter, withering Roses.’ The Devil gripped the woman's heart, With gall he staunched its bleeding; Far away, beyond the day, The Lord heard interceding. ‘Lord God, One in Three! Sure Thy anger closes; Yesterday I died, and see The Weary-wingëd over me Bitterly streweth Roses.’ The voice cried out, ‘Rejoice! rejoice! There shall be sleep for evil!’ And all the sweetness of God's voice Passed strangely through the Devil. X. Hermaphroditus. This is a section of a Singer's Brain— How delicately run the granular lines! By what strange chemic could I touch this thing, That it again might quicken and dissolve, Changing and blooming, into glittering gleams Of fancy; or what chemic could so quicken The soft soil backward that it might put forth Green vegetable shoots,—as long ago? Upon what headland did it blow of oid And ripen hitherward! Surely 'twas a place Flowery and starry! Cast it back to the grave! Look down no more, but raise thine eyes and see Who standeth glorious in the brightening Dawn! Behold him, on the apex of the cone, The perfect blossom of miraculous life, Hermaphroditus. With how subtle shade Male into female beauty mingleth—thews Of iron coated o'er with skin of silk;— There, on the crown he stands, the perfect one, Witching the world with sterile loveliness,— Beyond him, darkness and the unknown change, The next uncurtain'd and still higher scene That is to follow. Are those pinions,— peeping Under the delicate-flesh'd white shoulder-blades? XI. After. I see, as plain as eyes can see, From this dark point of mystery, Death sitting at his narrow Gate,— While all around, disconsolate, The wretched weep, the weary wait. God pity us who weep and wait! But, better still, if sadder, I From this dark corner can descry What is well-veil'd from human view: Beyond the Gate I can pursue The flight of those who have passed thro'. God pity us who have passed thro'! In at the portal, one by one, They creep, they crawl, with shivering moan— Nobles and Beggars, Priests and Kings; Out at the further gate each springs A Spirit,—with a pair of wings! God pity us now we have wings! All round the starry systems stir, Each silent as a death-chamber; There is no sound of melody, Only deep space and mystery; And each hath wings to wander free. God pity us who wander free! Some cannot use their wings at all; Some try a feeble flight and fall; A few, like larks in earthly skies, With measured beat of wings uprise, And make their way to Paradise. God help us on to Paradise! If ever in their flight through space They chance to reach that resting-place, I do not think these creatures dim Will find the Lord of Cherubim Exactly what they picture Him. May God be what we picture Him! Out of the fiery Sun is thrown To other worlds the meteor-stone; Back to the Sun, in season right, The meteor-stone doth take its flight. Lost in that melancholy light. We fade in melancholy light. I see, as plain as eyes can see, From this dark point of mystery, Those fledgling Spirits everywhere; They sing, they lessen, up the air; The go to God—Christ help them there! We go to God—Christ help us there! XII. His Prayer. In the time of transfiguration, Melt me, Master, like snow; Melt me, dissolve me, inhale me Into Thy wool-white cloud; With a warm wind blow me upward Over the hills and the seas, And upon a summer morning Poise me over the valley Of Thy mellow, mellow realm; Then, for a wondrous moment, Watch me from infinite space With Thy round red Eyeball of sunlight, And melt and dissolve me downward In the beautiful silver Rain That drippeth musically, With a glean like Starlight and Moonlight, On the footstool of Thy Throne. VIII. THE VISION OF THE MAN ACCURST. How in the end the Judgment dread Shall by the Lord thy God be said,— While brightly in a City of Rest Shall flash the fountains of the Blest, And gladdening around the Throne All mortal men shall smile,—save one. ... Children of Earth, hear, last and first, The Vision of the Man Accurst. Judgment was over; all the world redeem'd Save one Man,—who had sinned all sins, whose soul Was blackness and foul odour. Last of all, When all was lamb-white, through the summer Sea Of ministering Spirits he was drifted On to the white sands; there he lay and writhed, Worm-like, black, venomous, with eyes accurst Looking defiance, dazzled by the light That gleam'd upon his clench'd and bloodstain'd hands; While, with a voice low as a funeral bell, The Seraph, sickening, read the sable scroll, And as he read the Spirits ministrant Darken'd and murmur'd, ‘Cast him forth, O Lord!’ And, from the Shrine where unbeheld He broods, The Lord said, ‘'Tis the basest mortal born— Cast him beyond the Gate!’ The wild thing laugh'd Defiant, as from wave to wave of light He drifted, till he swept beyond the Gate, Past the pale Seraph with the silvern eyes; And there the wild Wind, that for ever beats About the edge of brightness, caught him up, And, like a straw, whirl'd round and lifted him, And on a dark shore in the Underworld Cast him, alone and shivering; for the Clime Was sunless, and the ice was like a sheet Of glistening tin, and the faint glimmering peaks Were twisted to fantastic forms of frost, And everywhere the frozen moonlight steam'd Foggy and blue, save where the abysses loom'd Sepulchral shadow. But the Man arose, With teeth gnash'd beast-like, waved wild feeble hands At the white Gate (that glimmer'd far away, Like to the round ball of the Sun beheld Through interstices in a wood of pine), Cast a shrill curse at the pale Judge within Then groaning, beast-like crouch'd. Like golden waves That break on a green island of the south, Amid the flash of many plumaged wings, Passed the fair days in Heaven. By the side Of quiet waters perfect Spirits walked, Low singing, in the star-dew, full of joy In their own thoughts and pictures of those thoughts Flash'd into eyes that loved them; while beside them, After exceeding storm, the Waters of Life With soft sea-sound subsided. Then God said, ‘'Tis finished—all is well!’ But as He spake A voice, from out the lonely Deep beneath, Mock'd! Then to the Seraph at the Gate, Who looketh on the Deep with steadfast eyes For ever, God cried, ‘What is he that mocks?’ The Seraph answered, ‘'Tis the Man accurst!’ And, with a voice of most exceeding peace, God ask'd, ‘What doth the Man?’ The Seraph said: ‘Upon a desolate peak, with hoar-frost hung, Amid the steaming vapours of the Moon, He sitteth on a throne, and hideously Playeth at judgment; at his feet, with eyes Slimy and luminous, squats a monstrous Toad; Above his head pale phantoms of the Stars Fulfil cold ministrations of the Void, And in their dim and melancholy lustre His shadow, and the shadow of the Toad Beneath him, linger. Sceptred, thron'd, and crown'd, The foul judgeth the foul, and sitting grim, Laughs!’ With a voice of most exceeding peace The Lord said, ‘Look no more!’ The Waters of Life Broke with a gentle sea-sound gladdening— God turn'd and blest them; as He blest the same, A voice from out the lonely Void beneath, Shriek'd! Then to the Seraph at the Gate, Who looketh on the Deep with steadfast eyes For ever, God cried, ‘What is he that shrieks?’ The Seraph answered, ‘'Tis the Man accurst!’ And, with a voice of most exceeding peace, God ask'd, ‘What doth the Man?’ The Seraph said: ‘Around him the wild phantasms of the fog Moan in the rheumy hoar-frost and cold steam. Long time, crown'd, sceptred, on his throne he sits Playing at judgment; then with shrill voice cries— “'Tis finished, thou art judged!” and, fiercely laughing, He thrusteth down an iron heel to crush The foul Toad, that with dim and luminous eyes So stareth at his Soul. Thrice doth he lift His foot up fiercely—lo! he shrinks and cowers— Then, with a wild glare at the far-off Gate, Rushes away, and, rushing through the dark, Shrieks!’ With a voice of most exceeding peace The Lord said, ‘Look no more!’ The Waters of Life, The living, spiritual Waters, broke, Fountain-like, up against the Master's Breast, Giving and taking blessing. Overhead Gather'd the shining legions of the Stars, Led by the ethereal Moon, with dewy eyes Of lustre: these have been baptised in fire, Their raiment is of molten diamond, And 'tis their office, as they circling move In their blue orbits, evermore to turn Their faces heavenward, drinking peace and strength From that great Flame which, in the core of Heaven, Like to the white heart of a violet burns, Diffusing rays and odour. Blessing all, God sought their beauteous orbits, and behold! The Eyes innumerably glistening Were turned away from Heaven, and with sick stare, Like the blue gleam of salt dissolved in fire, They searched the Void, as human faces look On horror. To the Seraph at the Gate, Who looketh on the Deep with steadfast eyes, God cried, ‘What is this thing whereon they gaze?’ The Seraph answered, ‘On the Man accurst.’ And, with a voice of most exceeding peace, God ask'd, ‘What doth the Man?’ The Seraph said: ‘O Master! send Thou forth a tongue of fire To wither up this worm! Serene and cold, Flooded with moon-dew, lies the World, and there The Man roams; and the image of the Man In the wan waters of the frosty sphere Falleth gigantic. Up and down he drifts, Worm-like, black, venomous, with eyes accursed, Waving his bloody hands in fierce appeal, So that the gracious faces of Thy Stars Are troubled, and the stainless tides of light Shadow pollution. With wild, ape-like eyes, The wild thing whining peers through horrent hair, And rusheth up and down, seeking to find A face to look upon, a hand to touch, A heart that beats; but all the World is void And beauteous. All alone in the Cold Clime, Alone within the lonely universe, Crawleth the Man accurst!’ Then said the Lord, ‘Doth he repent?’ And the fair Seraph said, ‘Nay he blasphemeth! Send Thou forth Thy fire!’ But with a voice of most exceeding peace, Out of the Shrine where unbeheld He broods, God said, ‘What I have made, a living Soul, Cannot be unmade, but endures for ever.’ Then added, ‘Call the Man!’ The Seraph heard, And in a low voice named the lost one's name; The wild Wind that for ever beats the Gate Caught up the word, and fled through the cold Void. 'Twas murmur'd on, as a lorn echo fading, From peak to peak. Swift as a wolf the Man Was rushing o'er a waste, with shadow streaming Backward against a frosty gleaming wind, When like a fearful whisper in his ear 'Twas wafted; then his blanch'd lips shook like leaves In that chill wind, his hair was lifted up, He paused, his shadow paused, like stone and shadow, And shivering, glaring round him, the Man moaned, ‘Who calls?’ and in a moment he was 'ware Of the white light streaming from the far Gate, And looming, blotted black against the light, The Seraph with uplifted forefinger, Naming his name! And ere the Man could fly, The wild Wind in its circuit swept upon him, And, like a straw, whirled him and lifted him, And cast him at the Gate,—a bloody thing— Mad, moaning, horrible, obscene, unclean; A body swollen and stainëd like the wool Of sheep that in the rainy season crawl About the hills, and sleep on foul damp beds Of bracken rusting red. There, breathing hard, Glaring with fiery eyes, panted the Man, With scorch'd lips drooping, thirsting as he heard The flowing of the Fountains far within. Then said the Lord, ‘Is the Man there?’ and ‘Yea,’ Answered the Seraph pale. Then said the Lord, ‘What doth the Man?’ The Seraph, frowning, said: ‘O Master, in the belly of him is fire, He thirsteth, fiercely thrusting out his hands, And threateneth, seeking water!’ Then the Lord Said, ‘Give him water—let him drink!’ The Seraph, Stooping above him, with forefinger bright Touched the gold kerbstone of the Gate, and lo! Water gush'd forth and gleamed; and lying prone The Man crawl'd thither, dipt his fever'd face, Drank long and deeply; then, his thirst appeased, Thrust in his bloody hands unto the wrist, And let the gleaming Fountain play upon them, And looking up out of his dripping hair, Grinned mockery at the giver. Then the Lord Said low, ‘How doth the Man?’ The Seraph said: ‘It is a snake! He mocketh all Thy gifts, And, in a snake's voice half-articulate, Blasphemeth!’ Then the Lord: ‘Doth the Man crave To enter in?’ ‘Not so,’ the Seraph said, ‘He saith—’ ‘What saith he?’ ‘That his Soul is filled With hate of Thee and of Thy ways; he loathes Pure pathways where the fruitage of the Stars Hangeth resplendent, and he spitteth hate On all Thy Children. Send Thou forth Thy fire! In no wise is he better than the beasts, The gentle beasts, that come like morning dew And vanish. Let him die!’ Then said the Lord: ‘What I have made endures; but 'tis not meet This thing should cross my perfect work for ever. Let him begone!’ Then cried the Seraph pale: ‘O Master! at the frozen Clime he glares In awe, shrieking at Thee!’ ‘What doth he crave? ‘Neither Thy Heaven nor by Thy holy ways. He murmureth out he is content to dwell In the Cold Clime for ever, so Thou sendest A face to look upon, a heart that beats, A hand to touch—albeit like himself, Black, venomous, unblest, exiled, and base: Give him this thing, he will be very still, Nor trouble Thee again.’ The Lord mused. Still, Scarce audible trembled the Waters of Life— Over all Heaven the Snow of the same Thought Which rose within the Spirit of the Lord Fell hushedly; the innumerable Eyes Swam in a lustrous dream. Then said the Lord: ‘In all the waste of worlds there dwelleth not Another like himself—behold he is The basest Mortal born. Yet 'tis not meet His cruel cry, for ever piteous, Should trouble my eternal Sabbath-day. Is there a Spirit here, a human thing, Will pass this day from the Gate Beautiful To share the exile of this Man accurst,— That he may cease the shrill pain of his cry, And I have peace?’ Hushedly, hushedly, Snow'd down the Thought Divine—the living Waters Murmured and darkened. But like mournful mist That hovers o'er an autumn pool, two Shapes, Beautiful, human, glided to the Gate And waited. ‘What art thou?’ in a stern voice The Seraph said, with dreadful forefinger Pointing to one. A gentle voice replied, ‘I will go forth with him whom ye call curst! He grew within my womb—my milk was white Upon his lips. I will go forth with him!’ ‘And thou?’ the Seraph said. The second Shape Answered, ‘I also will go forth with him; I have kist his lips, I have lain upon his breast, I bare him children, and I closed his eyes; I will go forth with him!’ Then said the Lord, ‘What Shapes are these who speak?’ The Seraph answered: ‘The woman who bore him and the wife he wed— The one he slew in anger—the other he stript, With ravenous claws, of raiment and of food.’ Then said the Lord, ‘Doth the Man hear?’ ‘He hears,’ Answer'd the Seraph; ‘like a wolf he lies, Venomous, bloody, dark, a thing accurst, And hearkeneth, with no sign!’ Then said the Lord: ‘Show them the Man,’ and the pale Seraph cried, ‘Behold!’ Hushedly, hushedly, hushedly, In heaven fell the Snow of Thought Divine, Gleaming upon the Waters of Life beneath, And melting,—as with slow and lingering pace, The Shapes stole forth into the windy cold, And saw the thing that lay and throbbed and lived, And stooped above him. Then one reach'd a hand And touch'd him, and the fierce thing shrank and spat, Hiding his face. ‘Have they beheld the Man?’ The Lord said; and the Seraph answer'd ‘Yea;’ And the Lord said again, ‘What doth the Man?’ ‘He lieth like a log in the wild blast, And as he lieth, lo! one sitting takes His head into her lap, and moans his name, And smoothes his matted hair from off his brow, And croons in a low voice a cradle song; And lo! the other kneeleth at his side, Half-shrinking in the old habit of her fear, Yet hungering with her eyes, and passionately Kissing his bloody hands.’ Then said the Lord, ‘Will they go forth with him?’ A voice replied, ‘He grew within my womb—my milk was white Upon his lips. I will go forth with him!’ And a voice cried, ‘I will go forth with him; I have kist his lips, I have lain upon his breast, I bare him children, and I closed his eyes; I will go forth with him!’ Still hushedly Snowed down the Thought Divine, the Waters of Life Flow'd softly, sadly; for an alien sound, A piteous human cry, a sob forlorn Thrill'd to the heart of Heaven. The Man wept. And in a voice of most exceeding peace The Lord said (while against the Breast Divine The Waters of Life leapt, gleaming, gladdening): ‘The Man is saved; let the Man enter in!’ Political Mystics. (1871.) Shades of the living Time, Phantoms men deem real, Rise to a runic rhyme, Cloak'd from head to heel! One by one ye pass As in a magician's glass, One by one displace The hood which veils the face; And ever we recognise, With terrible deep-drawn breath, Christ's inscrutable eyes, And the bloodless cheeks of Death! TITAN AND AVATAR. A CHORAL MYSTIC. I. Ode of Nations. 'Twas the height of the world's night, there was neither warmth nor light, And the heart of Earth was heavy as a stone; Yet the nations sick with loss saw the surge of heaven toss Round the meteor of the Cross; and with a moan All the people desolate gazed thereon and question'd fate, And the wind went by and bit them to the bone. Hope was fled and Faith was dead, and the black pell overhead Hung like Death's, for doom was heavy everywhere,— When there rose a sudden gleam, then a thunder, then a scream, Then a lightning, stream on stream aslant the air! And a dreadful ray was shed around the Cross, and it grew red, And the pallid people leapt to see the glare. Fire on the heights of France! Fire on the heights of France! Fire flaming up to heaven, streak on streak! How on France Kings look't askance! how the nations join'd in dance! To see the glory glance from peak to peak! How the chain'd lands curst their chance, as they bent their eyes on France! Earth answer'd, and her tongues began to speak. Now hark!—who lit the spark in the miserable dark? O Washington, men miss thee and forget. Where did the light arise, in answer to man's cries? In the West; in those far skies it rose and set. Who brought it in his breast from the liberated West? Speak his name, and kneel and bless him: Lafayette. O Sire, that madest Fire! How with passionate desire Leapt the nations while it gather'd and up-streamed; Then they fed it, to earth's groans, with Man's flesh and blood and bones, And with Altars and with Thrones; and still it screamed. Then they cast a King thereon—but a flash, and he was gone. Then they brought a Queen to feed it:— how it gleam'd! Then it came to pass, Earth's frame seem'd dissolving in the flame, Then it seem'd the Soul was shaken on its seat, And the pale Kings with thin cries look'd in one another's eyes, Saying, ‘Hither now it flies, and O how fleet! Sound loud the battle-cry, we must trample France or die, Strike the Altar, cast it down beneath our feet.’ Forth they fared. The red fire flared on the heights of France, and glared On the faces of the free who kept it fed; Came the Kings with blinded eyes, but with baffled prayers and cries They beheld it grow and rise, still bloody-red; When lo! the Fire's great heart, like a red rose cloven apart Open'd swiftly, to deep thunder overhead. And lo, amid the glow, while the pale Kings watched woe, Rose a single shape, and stood upon the pyre. Its eyes were deeply bright, and its face, in their sad sight, Was pallid in a white-heat of desire, And the cheek was ashen hued; and with folded arms it stood And smiled bareheaded, fawn'd on by the Fire! Forehead bare, the Shape stood there, in the centre of the glare, And cried, ‘Away ye Kings, or ye shall die.’ And it drave them back with flame, o'er the paths by which they came, And they wrung their hands in shame as they did fly. As they fled it came behind flecter-footed than the wind, And it scatter'd them, and smote them hip and thigh. All amazed, they stood and gazed, while their crying kingdoms blazed, With their fascinated eyes upon the Thing;— When lo, as clouds dilate, it grew greater and more great, And beneath it waited Fate with triple sting; All collossus-like and grand, it bestrode the sea and land, And behold the crownëd likeness of a King! Then the light upon the height, that had burned in all men's sight Was absorb'd into the creature where he smiled. O his face was wild and wan—but the burning current ran In the red veins of the Man who was its child:— To the sob of the world's heart did the meteor-light depart, Earth darken, and the Altar fall defiled. The aloud the Phantom vow'd, ‘Look upon me, O ye proud! Kiss my footprints! I am reaper, ye are wheat! Ye shall tremble at my name, ye shall eat my bread in shame, I will make ye gather tame beneath my Seat.’ And the gold that had been bright on the hair of Kings at night, Ere dawn was shining dust about his feet. At this hour behold him tower, in the darkness of his power, Look upon him, search his features, O ye free! Is there hope for living things in this fiery King of Kings, Doth the song that Freedom sings fit such as he? Is it night or is it day, while ye bleed beneath his sway? It is night, deep night on earth and air and sea. Still the height of the world's night. There is neither warmth nor light, And the heart of Earth is heavy as a stone; And within the night's dark core where the sad Cross gleam'd before Sits the Shape that Kings adore, upon a Throne; And the nations desolate crawl beneath and curse their fate, And the wind goes by and bites them to the bone. O Sire that mad'st the Fire, and the Shape that dread and dire Came from thence, the first and last born of the same, To Thee we praying throng, for Thou alone art strong, To right our daily wrong and bitter shame: From the aching breast of earth, lift the red Fire and its birth! Consume them—let them vanish in one flame! II. The Avatar's Dream. (Buonaparte loquitur, at Erfurt.) The cup is overflowing. Pour, pour yet, My Famulus—pour with free arm-sweep still, And when the wine is running o'er the brim, Sparkling with golden bubbles in the sun, I will stoop down and drink the full great draught Of glory, and as did those heroes old Drinking ambrosia in the happy isles, Dilate at once to perfect demigod. Meantime, I feast my eyes as the wine runs And the cup fills. Fill up, my Famulus! Pour out the precious juice of all the earth, Pour with great arm-sweep, that the world may see. O Famulus—O Spirit—O good Soul, Come close to me and listen—curl thyself Up in my breast—let us drink ecstasy Together; for the charm thou taughtest me I working like slow poison in the veins Of the great Nations: each, a wild-beast tamed, Looks mildly in mine eyes and from my hand Eats gently; and this day I speak the charm To Russia, and, behold! the crafty eyes Blink sleepily, while on the fatal lips Hovers the smile of appetite half-fed, Half-hungry: he being won, all else is won, And at our feet, our veritable slave, Lies Europe. Whisper now, Soul of my Soul, Since we have won this Europe with the sword, How we shall portion it to men anew. First, in the centre of the West, I set My signet like a star, and on a rock Base the imperial Throne: seated whereon, The royal crown of France upon my head, At hand the iron crown of Lombardy, And in my sceptre blended as a sign The hereditary gems of Italy, Spain, Holland, I shall see beneath my feet My Puppets sit with strings that reach my hand: Murat upon the throne of Italy, Jerome upon new-born Westphalia, Louis the lord of Holland, and perchance A kinsman in the Prussian dotard's place; And, lower yet, still puppets to my hand, Saxony, Würtemberg, Bavaria, The petty principalities and powers, All smiling up in our hot thunderous air;— And all the thrones, the kingdoms, and the powers That break to life beneath them, murmuring ‘Hail, King of Europe—Emperor of the West.’ Thus far. Still farther? Driven to the East, First by fond cunning, afterwards by blows, The Russian's eyes bloodshot with greed will watch, While still our flood-tide inexhaustible Of Empire washes to the Danube, rolls Into the Baltic, and with one huge wave Covers the plains of Poland. Then at last The mighty Empires of the East and West Shall clash together in the final blow, And that which loses shall be driven on To lead the heathen on in Asia, And that which hurls the other to such doom Shall be the chosen Regent of the World. Shall this be so, O Spirit? Pour, O pour — Yea, let me feast mine eyes upon the wine, Albeit I drink not. See!—Napoleon, Waif from the island in the southern sea, Sun to whom all the Kings o' the earth are stars, Sword before which all earthly swords are straws, Child of the Revolution, Crown and Head, Heart, Soul, Arm, King, of all Humanity! O Famulus—in God's name keep my soul From swooning to vain-glory. I believe God (not the other) sends thee, that thy mouth May fill me with a message for the race, And purge the peevish and distemper'd world Of her hereditary plague of Kings. For Man, I say, shall in due season grow Back to the likeness that he wore at first, One mighty nation peopling the green earth, One equal people with one King and head, One Kingdom with one Temple, and therein No priest, no idol, no ark sacrifice, But spheric music and the dreamy light Of heaven's mild azure and the changeless stars. The curse of earth hath been the folly of peace Under vain rulers, so dividing earth, That twenty thousand kings of Lilliput Strutted and fretted heaven and teased the time, Kept nature's skin for ever on the sting Like vermin, and perplex'd Humanity With petty pangs and peevish tyranny, While the soul sickened of obscure disease, And the innumerable limbs of state Moved paralysed, most inert, or dead. Came Revolution like avenging fire; And in the red flash miserable men Beheld themselves and wondered—saw their Kings Still strutting Lilliputian in the glare,— And laugh'd till heaven rung,—gave one fierce look To heaven, and rose. Outraged Columbia Breath'd o'er the sea, and scorch'd the insolent cheek Of Albion. Albion paled before the flame. The darken'd embers faded in the West, And all was still again; when one mad morn Men wakening, saw the heights of France afire! Earth shook to her foundation, and the light Illumed the hemispheres from west to east, And men that walk beneath and under us, Holding their heads to other stars, beheld The glory flaming from the underworld. The little Kings of Europe, lily-pale, Scream'd shrill to one another. Germany In her deep currents of philosophy Mirror'd the fiery horror. Russia groaned, Sheeted in snows that took the hue of blood Under the fierce reflection. Italy, Spain and the Tyrol, wild Helvetia, Caught havoc; and even on the white English crags A few strong spirits, in a race that binds Its body in chains and calls them Liberty, And calls each fresh link Progress, stood erect With faces pale that hunger'd to the light. Then, like a hero in his anguish, burnt Poor gentle Louis, whom the stars destined To be a barber and who was a King, And as he flamed and went like very straw, Earth shriek'd and fever'd France grew raving mad. Pass o'er the wild space of delirium, When France upon her stony bed of pain Raved, screamed, blasphemed, was medicined with blood, Forgot all issues and the course of time; And come to that supremer, stiller hour When, facing these fierce wasps of Kings who flocked To sting the weary sufferer to death, I rose and stood behind her, drove them back, So! with a sword-sweep. Those were merry days, My Spirit! These were spring days, winds of war Sharp-blowing, but the swallow on the way Already bringing summer from the south! Then one by one I held these little Kings Between my fingers and inspected them Like curious insects, while with buzz and hiss Their tiny stings were shooting in and out; And how I laugh'd To think such wretched vermin had so long Tortured unhappy Man, and to despair Driven him and his through infinite ways of woe! When, with one sweep of his great arm, one blow Of his sharp palm, he might annihilate Such creatures by the legion and in sooth Exterminate the breed! O Spirit of Man! A foolish Titan! foolish now as then, Guided about the earth like a blind man By any hand that leads, And then and now unconscious of a frame Whose strength, into one mighty effort gathered, Might shake the firmament of heaven itself! . . . Well, we have done this service. We have freed Earth from its pest of Kings, so that they crawl Powerless and stingless; we have medicined Desperate disease with direful remedies; And lo, the mighty Spirit of mankind Hath stagger'd from the sick-bed to his feet, And feebly totters, picking darken'd steps, And while I lead him on scarce sees the sun, But questions feebly ‘Whither?’ Whither? Indeed I am dumb, and all Earth's voices are as dumb— God is not dumber on His throne. In vain I would peer forward, but the path is black. Ay,—whither? O what peevish fools are mortals, Tormented by a raven on each shoulder, ‘Whither?’ and ‘wherefore?’ Shall I stand and gape At heaven, straining eyes into the tomb, Like some purblind philosopher or bard Asking stale questions of the Infinite Dumb with God's secret? questioning the winds, The waves, the stars, all things that live and move, All signs, all augurs? Never yet hath one Accorded answer. ‘Whither?’ Death replies With dusky smile. ‘Wherefore?’ The echoes laugh Their ‘wherefore? wherefore?’ Of the time unborn, And of the inevitable Law, no voice Bears witness. The pale Man upon the Cross Moan'd,—and beheld no further down the Void Than those who gather'd round to see Him die. Ay,—but the Soul, being weather-wise, can guess The morrow by the sunset, can it not? And there are signs about the path whereon I guide the foolish Titan, that imply Darkness and hidden dangers. All these last I smile at; but, O Soul within my Soul, 'Tis he, the foolish Titan's self, I fear: For, though I have a spell upon him now, And say it, and he follows, any morn (Awakening from his torpor as he woke One bloody morn in Paris and went wild), He may put out his frightful strength again, And with one mighty shock of agony Bring down the roof of Empire on my head. He loves me now, and to my song of war Murmurs deep undertone, and as he goes Fondles the hand that leads; but day by day Must I devise new songs and promises, More bloody incantation, lest he rouse And rend me. Oftentimes it seems he leads, I follow,—he the Tyrant, I the Slave,— And it, perchance, were better had I paused At Amiens, nor with terrible words and ways Led him thus far, still whispering in his ear That he at last shall look on ‘Liberty.’ Liberty? Have I lull'd him with a Lie? Or shall the Titan Spirit of man be led To look again upon the face of her, His first last love, a spirit woman-shaped, Whom in the sweet beginning he beheld, Adored, loved, lost, pursued, whom still in tears He yearns for; in whose name alone all Kings Have led and guided him a space and throve, Denying whom all Kings have died in turn, Whose memory is perfume, light and dream, Whose hope is incense, music, bliss, and tears, To him whose great heart with immortal beat Measures the dark march of Humanity. I do believe this Shape he saw and loved Was but a Phantasm, unsubstantial, strange, A vision never to be held and had, A spectral woman ne'er to be enjoyed; But such a thought whisper'd into his ear Were rank as blasphemy cried up at God. The name is yet a madness, a supreme Ecstasy and delirium! All things That cry it, move the tears into the eyes Of the sad Titan. Echoed from the heights Of France, it made him mad, and in his rage He tore at Earth's foundations. Evermore He turns his suffering orbs upon the dark, Uplifts his gentle hands to the chill stars, Pauses upon the path, and in the ear Of him who leadeth cries with broken voice, ‘How long, how long, how long?’ And unto him, This Titan, I, supreme of all the earth, Am but a pigmy (let me whisper it!) And I have won upon him with strange lies, And he has suffered all indignities, Bonds, chains, a band to blindfold both his eyes, Patient and meek, since I have sworn at last To lead him to the trysting-place where waits His constant love and most immortal Bride. Still in mine ears he murmureth her name, And follows. I have le him on through fire, Blood, darkness, tears, and still he hath been tame, Though ofttimes shrinking from things horrible, And on and on he follows even now, Blindfold, with slower and less willing feet— I fear with slower and less willing feet— And still I ead, through lurid light from heaven, Whither I know not. ‘Whither!’ Oftentimes My great heart fails, lest on some morn we reach That portal o'er which flaming Arch is writ, ‘All hope abandon ye who enter here!’ And he, perceiving he hath been befool'd, Will cast me from him with his last fierce breath Down through the gate into some pit of doom. Meantime he follows smiling. O Famulus! Could I but dream that she, the Shape he seeks, Whom men name Liberty, and gods name Peace, Were human, could inhale this dense dark air, Could live and dwell on earth, and rear the race, 'Twere well,—for by Almighty God I swear I would find out a means to join their hands And bless them, and abide their grateful doom. But she he seeks I know to be a dream, A vision of the rosy morning mist, A creature foreign to the earth and sea, Ne'er to be look'd upon by mortal soul Out of the mortal vision. Wherefore still I fear this Titan. I can never appease His hungry yearning wholly. He will bear No future chains, no closer blindfolding, And if a fatal whisper reach his ear, I and all mine are wholly wreck'd and lost. Yet is this Titan old so weak of wit, So senile-minded though so huge of frame, So deaf to warning voices when they cry, That, should no angel light from heaven an speak The mad truth in his ear, he will proceed Patiently as a lamb. He counteth not The weary years; his eyes are shut indeed With a half-smile, to see the mystic Face Pictured upon his brain; only at times He lifteth lids and gazeth wildly round, Clutching at the cold hand of him that guides,— But with a whisper he is calm'd again, Relapsing back into his gentle dream. O he is patient, and he will await Century after century in peace, So that he hears sweet songs of her he seeks, So that his guides do speak to him of her, So that he thinks to clasp her in the end. The end? Sweet sprite, the end is what I fear— If I might live for ever, Famulus!— Why am I not immortal and a god? I have caused tears enough, as bitter tears As ever by the rod divine were struck Out of this rock of earth. O for a spell Wherewith to cheat old Death, whose feet I hear Afar off, for I hate the bony touch Of hands that change the purple for the shroud! Yet I could go in peace (since all must go) So that my seed were risen and in its eyes I saw assurance of imperial thoughts, Strength, and a will to grasp the thunderbolt I leave unhurl'd beside the Olympian throne. Ah God, to die, and into the dark gloom Drag that throne with me, to the hollow laugh Of the awakening Titan! All my peers Are ciphers, all my brethren are mere Kings Of the old fashion, only strengthen'd now By my strong sunshine; reft of that, they die, Like sunflowers in the darkness. Death, old Death, Touch me this day, or any dark day soon, And I and mine are like the miser's hoard, A glorious and a glittering pile of gold Changed to a fluttering heap of wither'd leaves. This must not be. No, I must have a child. I must be firm and from my bed divorce The barren woman. Furthermore, to link My throne with all the lesser thrones of earth, I must wed the seed of Kings. Which seed, which child? Which round ripe armful of new destiny? Which regal mould for my imperial issue? Thine, fruitful house of Hapsburg? Russia, thine? The greater, not the lesser. I must wed Seed of the Czar, and so with nuptial rites Unite the empires of the East and West. Fill, fill, my Famulus, the golden cup I thirst for; all the peril as I gaze Hath faded. I no more with fluttering lips Cry ‘Whither?’ but with hands outstretch'd I watch Rubily glistening glory. It shall thrive! King of the West, sowing the seed of Kings First of the Empire of the Golden Age, The sleeping Titan, and the quiet Sea; Light of the Lotus and all mortal eyes, Whose orbit nations like to heliotropes Shall follow with lesser circle and sweet sound! III. The Elemental Quest. SEMI-CHORUS I. Form of her the Titan full of patience Sees amid the darkness of the nations; Voice of her whose sound in the beginning Came upon him desolate and sinning; Face and fairest form of her whose gleaming Soothes his gentle spirit into dreaming; Spirit! whom the Titan sees above him! SEMI-CHORUS II. Gentle eyes that shine and seem to love him! Tender touch, the thrill of her sweet fingers, Thrill that reach'd his soul and burns and lingers; Breath of her, and scent of her, and bliss of her; Dream of her, and smile of her, and kiss of her! Come again, and speak, and bend above him, Spirit that came once and seemed to love him. THE TITAN. How long, how long? SEMI-CHORUS I. Courage, great heart and strong, Break not, but beat low chime To the dark flow of Time; Follow the path foot-worn, Sad night and dewy morn, Under the weary sun Follow, O mighty one; Under dim moon and star! THE TITAN. Whither? How far, how far? SEMI-CHORUS I. Spirit of the fathomless abysses, Spirit that he looked upon and misses, Free and fair and perfect, more than human, Bringing love and peace-gifts like a woman; Come unto him, lessen to his pleading. SEMI-CHORUS II. Mark his patience, hear his gentle interceding; O'er mountain upon mountain left behind thee, He hath cheerly climb'd in vain to find thee: Wild waters he hath cross'd, wild sea and river, All countries he hath traversed, faithful ever, Ever hoping, ever waiting, never seeing. CHORUS. Spirit seen in some long darken'd being, Spirit that he saw at the world's portal, Saw, and knew, and loved, and felt immortal, Spirit that he wearies for and misses, Answer from the fathomless abysses! THE TITAN. How long, how long? SEMI-CHORUS I. Courage, O Titan strong! Courage, from place to place Still follow the voice and the face! THE TITAN. Whither? A VOICE AFAR. O hither! THE TITAN. Whither? SEMI-CHORUS I. Voice of her he follows in dumb pleasure, Camest thou from the earth or from the azure; Camest thou from the pastures on the mountains, From the ocean, from the rivers, from the fountains, From the vapours blowing o'er him while he hearkens, From the ocean hoar that beats his feet and darkens, From the star that on the sea-fringe melts and glistens? SEMI-CHORUS II. O homeless voice, he maddens as he listens, O voice divine, his wild lips part asunder; He speaketh, and his words are a low thunder. THE TITAN. Whither, O whither? VOICE AFAR. Hither! THE TITAN. Whither? Wherefore, while I wait in patience, Mock her voice, O voices of the nations; Wherefore by night and day, Where'er my slow feet stray, Trouble all hours with wild reverberations? Mountain winds, ye name her name unto me! Flowing rivers glance and thrill it through me! Earth, water, air, and sky, Name her as I go by! With her dim ghost the floating clouds pursue me. All of these have seen her face and love her, Earth beneath and heaven that bends above her; The rain-wreck and the storm Mimic the one fair form, The whirlwind knows her name and cries it over. Flowers are sown by her bright foot, wherever They are flashing past by mere and river; Birds in the forest stir, Singing mad praise of her; All green paths know her, though she flies for ever. CHORUS. Joy of wind and wave and cloud and blossom, Pause at last, and fall upon his bosom! THE TITAN. None behold her twice, but having conn'd her While she flashes past with feet that wander, Remember the blest gleam, And grow by it, and dream, And fondle the sweet memory, and ponder. All have known her, and yet none possess her; None behold her, yet all things caress her; The warmth of her white feet, Where it doth fall so sweet, Abides for ever there, and all things bless her. Faster than the prophesying swallow, Fast by wood and sea and hill and hollow, Sought by all things that be, But most of all by me, She flieth none know whither, and I follow. SEMI-CHORUS I. O wherefore, radiant one, Under the moon and sun, Glimmer away? VOICE AFAR. Here on the heights I stay; Come hither. THE TITAN. Whither? VOICE AFAR. O hither! CHORUS. Form of her the Titan full of patience Sees amid the darkness of the nations; Voice of her whose song in the beginning Came upon him desolate and sinning; Face and fairest form of her whose gleaming Soothes his gentle spirit into dreaming; Touch of her, the thrill of her quick fingers, Thrill that reach'd his soul and burns and lingers; Soul beyond his soul, yet ever near it, His heart's home, and haven of his spirit; Joy of wind and wave and cloud and blossom, Pause at last, and fall upon his bosom! IV. The Elemental Doom. CHORUS OF SPIRITS. Strange hands are passing across our eyes, Before our souls strange visions rise And dim shapes flash and flee. The mists of dream are backward roll'd— As from a mountain, we behold What is, and yet shall be. A VOICE. Speak, while the depths of dream unfold, What is it that ye see? SEMI-CHORUS I. 'Tis vision. Lo, before us stands, Casting his shade on many lands, The mighty Titan, by the sea Of tempest-tost humanity; And to the earth, and sea, and sky, He uttereth a thunder-cry Out of his breaking heart, And the fierce elements reply, And earth is cloven apart. SEMI-CHORUS II. Like sparks blown from a forge, the spheres Drift o'er us;—all our eyes and ears Are full of fire and sound. With blood about him blown like rain, We see how on a darken'd plain Stands the Avatar, crown'd. Silent he waits, and white as death, Looks in the Titan's eyes. They stand—the black sky holds its breath— The deep Sea stills its cries, The mad storm hushes driving past, The sick stars pause and gaze—the blast, The wind-rent rain, the vapours dark, Like dead things crouch, and wait, and hark; And lo! those twain alone and dumb Loom desolate and strange. SEMI-CHORUS I. Is the time come? SEMI-CHORUS II. The time is come. CHORUS. Titan, to thy revenge! SEMI-CHORUS I. O look and listen! His great eyes glisten, Like an oak the storm rendeth He swayeth and bendeth, With lips torn asunder He shakes, but no thunder Comes thence. SEMI-CHORUS II. While still nigh him, With smiles that defy him, The crown'd one is standing,— His pale look commanding A tigress, that crouching Beneath him and touching His feet with low cries, Waits, fiercely betraying Blood's thirst yet obeying His eyes! CHORUS. Is he doom'd? A VOICE. He is doom'd. CHORUS. Oh, by whom? VOICE. By the child yet unborn in the womb, By the dead laid to sleep in the tomb, He is doom'd, he is doom'd. CHORUS. Speak his doom! THE TITAN. Napoleon! Napoleon! THE AVATAR. Who cries? THE TITAN. I, child of the earth and the skies, I, Titan, the mystical birth, Whose voice since the morning of earth Hath doom'd such as thou in the end, Speak thy doom! THE AVATAR. Speak! I smile and attend. THE TITAN. Because thou hast with lies and incantations, With broken vows and false asseverations, For thine own ends accurst, Betrayed me from the first, I speak, and doom thee, in the name of nations. Because I have wander'd like a great stream flowing From its own channel and through strange gulfs going, So that for years and years I must retrace in tears The black and barren pathway of thy showing. Because one further step after thy leading Had hurl'd me down to doom past interceding, So that I never again, In passion or in pain, Might look upon the face I follow pleading. Because thou hast led me blind, knee-deep through slaughter, Through fields of blood that wash'd our way like water, Because in that divine Name I adore, and mine, Thou hast bruised Earth, and to desolation brought her. Because thou hast been a liar and blasphemer, Deeming me triply dotard and a dreamer. Because thy hand at length Would strike me in my strength, Me, deathless! me, diviner and supremer! Because all voices of the earth and azure, All things that breathe, all things curst for thy pleasure, All poor dead men who died To feed thy bitter pride, All living, all dead, cry—mete to him our measure! Because thou hast slain Kings, and as a token Stolen their crowns and worn them, having spoken My curse against the same; Because all things proclaim That thou didst swear a troth, and that 'tis broken. By her whom thou didst swear under God's heaven To find; by her who being found was driven O'er earth, air, sky, and sea, Through desolate ways, by thee, With voice appealing and with raiment riven! Because thou hast turned upon and violated Her soul to whom thou first wert consecrated, Because, thro' thy soul's lie And life's delusion, I Must wait more ages, who have wept and waited Since the beginning. By the soul of Patience, Sick of thy face and its abominations, I speak on thine and thee The doom of Destiny, Hear it, and die, hear in the name of nations! SEMI-CHORUS I. Is he doom'd? SEMI-CHORUS II. He is doom'd. 'Tis the end. THE TITAN. Napoleon! THE AVATAR. Speak! I attend. THE TITAN. Utter the doom thou dost crave. THE AVATAR. 'Tis spoken. A shroud and a grave. THE TITAN. O voices of earth, air, and sky, Hear ye his doom, and reply. HUMAN VOICES. Death is sleep. Let him wake and not die. THE TITAN. Because by thee all comfort hath been taken, So that the Earth rocks still forlorn and shaken, Staring at the sad skies With sleepless aching eyes, Thou shalt not die, but wait and watch and waken. This is thy doom. Lone as a star thy being Shall see the waves break and the drift-cloud fleeing, Hear the wind cry and grow, Watch the great waters flow, And seeing all, shine hid from all men's seeing. Here on this Isle amid a sea of sorrow I cast thee down. Black night and weary morrow, Lie there alone, forgot, So doom'd and pitied not; Let all things watch thy face, and thy face borrow The look of these mad elements that ever Strike, scream, and mingle, sever and dissever; Gather from air and sea The thirst of all things free, The up-looking want, the hunger ceasing never. All shall forget thee. Thou shalt hear the nations Flocking with music light and acclamations To kiss his royal feet Who sitteth in thy Seat, Surrounded by the slaves of lofty stations. A rock in the lone Sea shall be thy pillow. In the wide waste of gray wave and green billow, The days shall rise and set In silence, and forget To sun thee,—a black shape beneath a willow Watching the weary waters with heart bleeding; Or dreaming cheek upon thy hand; or reading The book upon thy knee; And ever as the sea Moans, raising eyes to the still heavens, and pleading: Till like a wave worn out with silent breaking Or like a wind blown weary; thou, forsaking Thy tenement of clay, Shalt wear and waste away, And grow a portion of the ever-waking Tumult of cloud and sea. Feature by feature Losing the likeness of the living creature, Returning back thy form To its elements of storm, Thou shalt dissolve in the great wreck of Nature. SEMI-CHORUS I. Is it done? SEMI-CHORUS II. It is done. SEMI-CHORUS I. Look again. SEMI-CHORUS II. I see on the rock in the main The Shape sitting dark by the sea, And his shade, and the shade of the tree, Where he sitteth, are pencil'd jet-black On the luminous sky at his back; But lo! while I gaze, from the sky Like phantoms they vanish and die:— All is dark. SEMI-CHORUS I. Look again. SEMI-CHORUS II. Hark, O hark! SEMI-CHORUS I. A shrill cry is piercing the dark— Like the multitudinous moan Of the waves as they clash, comes a groan From afar— THE TITAN. What is this, O ye free? SEMI-CHORUS II. He has gone like a wave of the sea— Day dieth, the light falleth red,— O Titan, behold he is dead! . . . CHORUS. Strange hands are passed across our eyes, Before our souls strange visions rise, And dim shapes flash and flee; The mists of dream are backward rolled— As from a mountain we behold That Island in the sea. SEMI-CHORUS I. Now bow thy face upon thy breast, O Titan, and bemoan thy quest! O look not thither with thine eyes, But lift them to the constant skies! THE TITAN. What do ye see that thus to me Ye turn and smile so bitterly? SEMI-CHORUS I. 'Tis vision. On that island bare Sits one with face divinely fair, And pensive smiling lips; And on her lap the proud head lies. Pale with the seal on its proud eyes Of Death's divine eclipse; All round is darkness of the sea, And sorrow of the cloud. SEMI-CHORUS II. Yet she Is making with her heavenly face Sweetness like sunlight; and the place Grows luminous; and the world afar Looks thither as to some new star, All wondering; and with lips of death Men name one name beneath their breath, Not cursing as of yore, for now All the inexorable brow Is mouldering marble. SEMI-CHORUS I. Hark, O hark! A silver voice divides the dark! A VOICE. Hither, O hither! ANOTHER VOICE. Whither? FIRST VOICE. O sweet is sleep if sleep be deep, And sweetest far to eyes that weep; He who upon my breast doth creep Shall close his weary eyes and sleep. Yet he who seeks me shall not find, And he who chains me shall not bind; For fleeter-footed than the wind I still elude all human kind. But when, soul-weary of the chase, Falleth some man of mortal race, I pause—I find him in his place, I pause—I bless his dying face! Whatsoever man he be, I take his head upon my knee, I give him words and kisses three, Kissing I whisper, ‘Thou art free! O free is sleep if sleep be deep!— I soothe them sleeping, and I heap Greenness above them, and they weep No longer, but are free, and sleep. O royal face and royal head! O lips that thunder'd! O eyes red With nights of watch! O great soul dead! Thy blood is water, thy heart lead! They doom'd thee in my name, but see! I doom thee not, but set thee free; Balm for all hearts is shed by me, And for all spirits, liberty. He finds me least who loves me best, His Soul in an eternal quest Wails still, while one by one are prest Tyrants that hate me, to my breast. The sad days fly—the slow years creep, And he alone doth never sleep. Would he might slumber and not weep. O free is sleep, if sleep be deep. THE TITAN. Irene! THE FOOL OF DESTINY. A CHORIC DRAMA. Scene.—The Château of Wilhelmshöhe, in Cassel. German Citizens walking in the Gardens without. FIRST CITIZEN. How fine it is to lounge in talk Together, down this long green walk While russet trees to left and right Snaring the rosy shafts of light Shade them to silver, till they glow There on the roof of the château Gleaming bright ruby! SECOND CITIZEN. Not too near— The place is private. FIRST CITIZEN. Didst thou hear The news? Another glorious blow For Fatherland! SECOND CITIZEN. To-night at five I saw the courier arrive, Bringing the news to him who waits Yonder.—O he may thank the fates He sits so snug, the man of sin!— How cunningly, before the end, The Snake contrived to save his skin! FIRST CITIZEN. Thou art too hard upon him, friend. He saw that all his cards were played, And so, to save more bloodshed, strayed Into the cage. SECOND CITIZEN. A cage, indeed! Where from a gold plate he may feed Of all earth's dainties, while afar France, 'neath the tramping feet of War, Bleeds like a winepress. There he lolls, Butcher of bodies and of souls, Smiling, and sees the storm blow by! FIRST CITIZEN. What could he do? SECOND CITIZEN. Could he not die? FIRST CITIZEN. Die? Sentiment! If I were he I'd bless the stars which set me free From that foul-hearted Whore's embrace, France, with her fickle painted face. Better in Germany to dine, Smoke one's cigar, and sip one's wine; And in good time, like most, no doubt, Who have worn their wicked members out, Repent, and be absolved, and then Die in one's bed, like smaller men! SECOND CITIZEN. Thou cynic! FIRST CITIZEN'S WIFE. Dost thou think that he Is happy? FIRST CITIZEN. Why not? . . . Possibly, My dear, 'tis something after all To know the worst that can befall; To know, whatever joy or sorrow Fate is preparing for the morrow, It cannot make more dark the lot One bears to-night. Happy! Why not? Happy as most of our poor kind. WIFE. He hath so much upon his mind! FIRST CITIZEN. A woman's thought;—but hark to me, And take this for philosophy— Beyond a given amount of pain, The spirit suffers not a grain. What stuff we humble folk are taught Of monarchs and their weight of thought! Why, thou and I, and Jack and Jill, Feel just as much of good and ill, Of life and strife, of thought and care, As he who sitteth musing there! SECOND CITIZEN. I saw him walking, yesterday. He is much aged of late, they say— He stoops much, and his features are Gray as the ash of the cigar He smokes for ever. FIRST CITIZEN (to wife). Come, my dear, Let's home! 'Tis growing chilly here; So!—take my arm. Yes, I contend It matters little in the end If one be Beggar, Priest, or King— The whip's for all—the pang, the sting! Dost thou remember—canst forget? When all our goods were seized for debt, In Friedberg? Claim was heap'd on claim— Blow came on blow—shame follow'd shame And last to crown our dire distress, Thy brother Hans' hard-heartedness. Think you I felt a whit less sad, Less thunderstruck, less fierce, less mad, Than yonder melancholy Man, When, through the dark cloud of Sedan, He, as a star that shoots by night, Swept from his sphere of lonely light, And at the feet of Wilhelm lay Glow-worm-like, in the garish day Of conquest? Well, well! wait and see— I rose again, and so may he. The world is but a Play, tho' ye Dear creatures take it seriously! I cannot pity from my heart The player of the Monarch's part, For at the worst he never knows The famish'd Body's bitter throes. I pity more with all my soul The filler of the Soldier's rôle, Who feels the ball, and with a groan Sinks in the bloody ranks unknown, And while the far-off cannon cries, Kisses his sweetheart's hair, and dies. [Exeunt. Napoleon. A Physician. PHYSICIAN. The sickness is no sickness of the flesh, No ailment such as common mortals feel, But spiritual: 'tis thy fiery thought Drying the wholesome humour of the veins, Consuming the brain's substance, and from thence, As flame spreads, through each muscle, vein, and nerve, Reaching the vital members. If your Highness Could stoop from the tense strain of great affairs To books and music, or such idle things As wing the weary hours for lesser men! Turn not thine eyes to France; receive no news: Shut out the blinding gleam of battle: rest From all fierce ache of thought; and for a time Let the wild world go by. NAPOLEON. Enough, old friend: Thine is most wholesome counsel. I will seek To make this feverish mass of nerve and thew, This thing of fretful heart-beats, Fulfil its functions more mechanically. Farewell. PHYSICIAN. Farewell, Sire. Brighter waking thoughts, And sweeter dreams, attend thee! [Exit. NAPOLEON. All things change Their summer livery for the autumn tinge Of wind-blown withering leaves. That man is faithful,— I have been fed from his cold palm for years, And I believe, so strongly use and wont Fetter such natures, he would die to serve me; Yet do I see in his familiar eyes The fatal pain of pity. I have lain At Death's door divers times, and he hath slowly, With subtle cunning and most confident skill, Woo'd back my breath, but never even then, Though God's Hand held me down, did he regard me With so intense a gaze as now, when smitten By the mail'd hand of Man. I am not dead! Not dying! only sick,—as all are sick Who feel the mortal prison-house too weak For the free play of Soul! I eat and drink— I laugh—I weep, perchance—I feel—I think— I still preserve all functions of a man— Yet doth the free wind of the fickle world Blow on me with as chilly a respect As on a nameless grave. Is there so sad A sunset on my face, that all beholding Think only of the morrow?—other minds, Other hearts, other hands? Almighty God, If I dare pray Thee by that name of God, Strengthen me! blow upon me with Thy breath! Let one last memorable flash of fire Burst from the blackening brand!— Yes, sick—sick—sick: Sick of the world; sick of the fitful fools That I have played with; sick, forsooth, of breath, Of thought, of hope, of Time. I staked my Soul Against a Crown, and won. I wore the Crown, And 'twas of burning fire. I staked my Crown Against a Continent, and lost. I am here; Fallen, unking'd, the shadow of a power, Yet not heart-broken—no, not heart-broken— But surely with more equable a pulse Than when I sat on yonder lonely Seat Fishing for wretched souls, and for my sport, Although the bait was dainty to the taste, Hooking the basest only. I am nearer To the world's heart than then; 'tis bitter bread, Most bitter, yea, most bitter; yet I eat More freely, and sleep safer. I could die now: And yet I dare not die. Maker of men! Thou Wind before whose strange breath we are clouds Driving and changing!—Thou who dost abide While all the laurels on the brows of Kings Wither as wreaths of snow!—Thou Voice that dwellest In the high sleeping chambers of the great, When council and the feverish pomp are hush'd, And the dim lamp burns low, and at its side The sleeping potion in a cup of gold:— Hear me, O God, in this my travail hour! From first to last, Thou knowest—yea, Thou knowest— I have been a man of peace: a silent man, Thought-loving, most ambitious to appease Self-chiding fears of mental littleness, A planner of delights for foolish men— In all, a man of peace. I struck one blow, And saw my hands were bloody; from that hour I knew myself too delicately wrought For crimson pageants; yea, the sight of pain Sicken'd me like a woman. Day and night I felt that stain on my immortal soul, And gloved it from the world, and diligently Wrought the red sword of empire to a scythe For the swart hands of husbandmen to reap Abundant harvest.—Nay, but hear me swear, I never dreamed such human harvests blest As spring from that red rain which pours this day On the fair fields I sowed. Never, O God, Was I a butcher or a thing of blood; Always a man of peace:—in mine ambition Peace-seeking, peace-engendering;—till that day I saw the half-unloosen'd hounds of War Yelp on the chain and gnash their bloody teeth, Ready to rend mine unoffending Child, In whose weak hand the mimic toy of empire Trembled to fall. Then feverishly I wrought A weapon in the dark to smite those hounds From mine imperial seat; and as I wrought One of the fiends that came of old to Cain Found me, and since I thirsted gave to me A philtre, and in idiocy I drank: When suddenly I heard as in a dream Trumpets around me silver-tongued, and saw The many-colour'd banners gleam in the sun Above the crying legions, and I rode Royal before them, drunk with light and power, My boy beside me blooming like a rose To see the glorious show. Yet God, my God, Even then I swear the hideous lust of life Was far from me and mine; nay, I rode forth, As to a gay review at break of day, A student dazzled with the golden glare, Half conscious of the cries of those he ruled, Half brooding o'er the book that he had left Open within his chamber. ‘Blood may flow.’ I thought, ‘a little blood—a few poor drops,— A few poor drops of blood: but they shall prove Pearls of great price to buy my people peace; The hounds of War shall turn from our fair fields, And on my son a robe like this I wear Shall fall, and make him royal for all time! O fool, fool, fool! What was I but a child, Pleased beyond understanding with a toy, Till in mine ears the scream of murther'd France Rang like a knell. I had slain my best beloved! The curse of blood was on mine hands again! My gentle boy, with wild affrighted gaze, Turn'd from his sire, and moaned; the hounds of War Scream'd round me, glaring with their pitiless eyes Innumerable as the eyes of heaven; I felt the sob of the world's woe; I saw The fiery rain fill all the innocent air; And, feeble as a maid who hides her face In terror at a sword-flash, conscience-struck, Sick, stupefied, appalled, and all alone, I totter'd, grasped the empty air,—and fell! CHORUS OF SPIRITS. Vast Sea of Life that, 'neath the arc Of yonder glistening sky, Rollest thy waters deep and dark, While windy years blow by: On thy pale shore this night we stand, And hear thy wash upon the sand. Calm is thy sheet and wanly bright, Low is thy voice and deep; There is no child on earth this night Wrapt in a gentler sleep; Crouch'd like a hound thou liest now, With eye upcast and dreadful brow. O Sea, thy breast is deep and blest After a dreadful day; And yet thou listenest in thy rest For some sign far away; Watching with fascinated eyes The uplifted Finger in the skies! A hundred years thy still tides go And touch the self-same mark— Thus far, no farther, may they flow And fall in light and dark; The mystic water-line is drawn By moonlit night and glimmering dawn. Sure as a heart-beat year by year, Though winds and thunders call, Be it storm or calm, the tides appear, Touch the long line and fall, Liquid and luminously dim; And men build dwellings on their brim. O well may this man wring his hands, And utter a wild prayer. He built above thy lonely sands A Feast-house passing fair; It rose above thy sands, O Sea, In a fair nook of greenery. For he had watched thee many days, And mark'd thy weedy line, And far above the same did raise His Temple undivine. Throng'd with fair shapes of sin and guilt It rose most magically built. Not to the one eternal Light, Lamp of both quick and dead, Did he uprear it in thy sight, But with a smile he said: ‘To the unvarying laws of Fate, This Temple fair I dedicate. ‘To that sure law by which the Sea Is driven to come and go Within one mystic boundary, And can no further flow; So that who knoweth destiny May safely build, nor fear the Sea!’ O fool! O miserable clod! O creature made to die! Who thought to mark the might of God And mete it with his eye; Who measured God's mysterious ways By laws of common nights and days. O worm, that sought to pass God by, Nor feared that God's revenge: The law within the law, whereby All things work on to change; Who guessed not how the still law's course Accumulates superfluous force;— How for long intervals and vast Strange secrets hide from day, Till Nature's womb upheaves to cast The gather'd load away; How deep the very laws of life Deposit elements of strife. O many a year in sun and shower The quiet waters creep!— But suddenly on some dark hour Strange trouble shakes the deep: Silent and monstrous thro' the gloom Rises the Tidal Wave for doom. Then woe for all who, like this Man, Have built so near the Sea, For what avails the human plan When the new force flows free? Over their bonds the waters stream, And Empires crash and despots scream. O, is it earthquake far below Where the still forces sleep? Doth the volcano shriek and glow, Unseen beneath the deep? We know not; suddenly as death Comes the great Wave with fatal breath. God works His ends for ever thus, And lets the great plan roll He wrought all things miraculous, The Sea, the Earth, the Soul; And nature from dark springs doth draw Her fatal miracles of law. O well may this Man wring his hands. And utter a wild prayer; He built above the shifting sands A Feast-house passing fair. Long years it stood, a thing of shame: At last the mighty moment came. Crashing like grass into its grave, Fell down the fair abode; The despot struggled in the wave, And swimming screamed to God. And lo, the waters with deep roar Cast the black weed upon the shore. Then with no warning, as they rose, Shrunk back to their old bounds: Tho' still with deep volcanic throes And sad mysterious sounds They quake. The Man upon their brim Sees wreck of Empire washed to him. Vast Sea of life, that 'neath the arc Of yonder glistening sky, Spreadest thy waters strange and dark While windy years blow by, Creep closer, kiss his feet, O Sea, Poor baffled worm of Destiny! Fain would he read with those dull eyes What never man hath known, The secret that within thee lies Seen by God's sight alone; Thou watchest Heaven all hours; but he, Praying to Heaven, watches thee. So will he watch with weary breath, Musing beside the deep, Till on thy shore he sinks in death, And thy still tides upcreep, Raise him with cold forgiving kiss, And wash his dust to the Abyss. Napoleon. A Bishop. NAPOLEON. Speak out thy tidings quickly, How fares it with the Empress and my son? BISHOP. Well, Sire. They bid thee look thy fate in the face, And be of cheer. NAPOLEON. Where didst thou part with them? BISHOP. In England, Sire, where they have found a home Among the frozen-blooded islanders, Who yesterday called blessings on thy brow, And now rejoice in thy calamity. Thus much thy mighty lady bade me say, If I should find thee private in thy woe:— With thy great name the streets are garrulous: Mart, theatre, and church, palace and prison, Down to the very commons by the road Where Egypt's bastard children pitch their tents, Murmur ‘Napoleon’; but, alas! the sound Is an echo that with no refrain, No loving echo in a living voice, Dies a cold death among the mountain snow. NAPOLEON. Old man, I never looked for friendship there, I never loved that England in my heart; Tho' 'twas by such a sampler I believed To weave our France's fortunes thriftily With the gold tissues of prosperity. BISHOP. Ah, Sire, if I dare speak— NAPOLEON. Speak on. BISHOP. Too much Thine eyes to that cold isle of heretics Turn'd from thy throne for use and precedent; Too little did they look, and that too late, On that strong rock whereon the Lord thy God Hath built His Holy Church. NAPOLEON. Something of this I have heard in happier seasons. BISHOP. Hear it now In the dark day of thine adversity. O Sire, by him who holds the blessed Keys, Christ's Vicar on the earth for blinded men, I do conjure thee, hearken—with my mouth, Though I am weak and low, the Holy Church Cries to her erring son! NAPOLEON. Well, well, he hears. BISHOP. Thou smilest, Sire. With such a smile, so grim, So bitter, didst thou mock our blessed cause In thy prosperity. NAPOLEON. False, Bishop, false! I made a bloody circle with my sword Round the old Father's head, and so secured him Safe on his tottering Seat against the world, When all the world cried that his time was come. What then? He totter'd on. I could not prop His Seat up with my sword, that Seat being built, Not on a rock, but sand. BISHOP. The world is sick And old indeed, when lips like thine blaspheme. Whisper such words out on the common air, And, as a child, Blow thy last hopes away. NAPOLEON. Hopes, hopes! What hopes? What knowest thou of hopes? BISHOP. Thy throne was rear'd (Nay hear me, Sire, in patience to the end) Not on the vulgar unsubstantial air Which men call Freedom, not on half consent Of unbelievers—tho', alas! thou hast stoop'd To smile on unbelievers—not on lives That saw in thee one of the good and wise, Not wholly on the watchword of thy name; But first on this—the swords thy gold could buy, And most and last, upon the help of those Who to remotest corners of our land Watch o'er the souls of men, sit at their hearths, Lend their solemnity to birth and death, Guide as they list the motions of the mind, And as they list with darkness or with light Appease the spiritual hunger. Where Had France been, and thou, boasted Sun of France, For nineteen harvests, save for those who crept Thine agents into every cottage-door, Slowly diffusing thro' each vein of France The sleepy wine of empire? Like to slaves These served thee, used thy glory for a charm, Hung up thine image in a peasant's room, Beside our blessed Saints, and cunningly, As shepherds drive their sheep unto the fold, Gather'd thy crying people where thy hand Might choose them out for very butchery. Nay, more; as fearful men may stamp out fire, They in the spirits of thy people killed The sparks of peril left from those dark days, When France being drunk with blood and mad with pain Sprang on the burning pyre, and with her raiment Burning and streaming crimson in the wind, Curst and denied her God. They made men see, Yea, in the very name of Liberty, A net of Satan's set to snare the soul From Christ and Christ's salvation: in their palms They welded the soft clay of popular thought To this wish'd semblance yet more cunningly; Till not a peasant heir of his own fields, And not a citizen that own'd a house, And not a man or woman who had saved, But when some wild voice shriek'd out ‘Liberty!’ Trembled as if the robber's foot were set Already on his threshold, and in fear Clutch'd at his little store. These things did they, Christ's servants serving thee; they were as veins Bearing the blood through France from thee its heart Throbbing full glorious in the capital. And thou, O Sire, in thine own secret mind Knowest what meed thou hast accorded them, Who, thy sworn liegemen in thy triumph-hour, Are still thy props in thy calamity. NAPOLEON. Well; have you done? BISHOP. Not yet. NAPOLEON. What more? BISHOP. Look round This day on Europe, look upon the World, Which like a dark tree o'er the river of Time Hangeth with fruit of races, goodly some, Some rotten to the core. Out of the heart Of what had seem'd the sunset of the west, Rises the Teuton, silent, subtle, and sure, Gathering his venom slowly like a snake Wrapping the sleepy lands in fold by fold; Then springing up to stab his prey with fangs Numerous as spears of wheat in harvest time. O, he is wise, the Teuton, he is deep As Satan's self in perilous human lore, Such as the purblind deem philosophy! But, be he cunning as the Tempter was, Christ yet shall bruise his head; for in himself He bears, as serpents use, A brood of lesser snakes, cunning things too But lesser, and of these many prepare Such peril as in his most glorious hour May strike him feebler than the wretched worms That crawl this day on the dead lambs of France. Meantime, he to his purpose moves most slow, And overcomes. Note how, upon her rock The sea-beast Albion, swollen with idle years Of basking in the prosperous sunshine, rolls Her fearful eyes, and murmurs. See how wildly The merciless Russian paceth like a bear His lonely steppes of snow, and with deep moan Calling his hideous young, casts famished eyes On that worn Paralytic in the East, Whom thou of old didst save. Call thou to these For succour; shall they stir? Will the seabeast Budge from her rock? Will the bear leave his wilds? Then mark how feebly in the wintry cold Old Austria ruffles up her plumage, Sire, Covering the half-heal'd wound upon her neck; See how on Spain her home-bred vermin feed, As did the worms on Herod; Italy Is as a dove-cote by a battle-field, Abandoned to the kites of infamy, Belgium, Denmark, and Helvetia, Like plovers watching while the wind-hover Strikes down one of their miserable kind, Wheeling upon the wind cry to each other; And far away the Eagle of the West, Poised in the lull of her own hurricane, Sits watching thee with eyes as blank of love As those grey seas that break beneath her feet. NAPOLEON. This is cold comfort, yet I am patient. Well? To the issue! Dost thou keep behind the salve Whose touch shall heal my wounds? or dost thou only, As any raven on occasion can, Croak out the stale truth, that the day is lost, And that the world's slaves knee the conqueror? BISHOP. Look not on these, thy crownëd peers, for aid, But inward. Read thy heart. NAPOLEON. It is a book I have studied somewhat deeply. BISHOP. In thine heart, Tho' the cold lips might sneer, the dark brow frown, Wert thou not ever one believing God? NAPOLEON. I have believed, and do believe, in God. BISHOP. For that, give thanks to God. He shall uplift thee. NAPOLEON. How? BISHOP. By the secret hands of His great Church. Even now in darkness and on tilths remote They labour in thy service; one by one They gather up the fallen reins of power And keep them for thy grasp; so be thou sure, When thou hast woven round about thy soul The robe of holiness, and from the hands Of Holy Church demandest thy lost throne, It shall be hers to give thee. NAPOLEON. In good truth, I scarce conceive thee. What, degenerate Rome, With scarce the power in this strong wind of war To hold her ragged gauds about her limbs; Rome, reft of the deep thunder in her voice, The dark curse in her eye; Rome, old, dumb, blind,— Shall Rome give Kingdoms?—Why, she hath already Transferred her own to Heaven. BISHOP. Canst thou follow The coming and the going of the wind, Fathom the green abysses of the sea? For such as these, is Rome:—the voice of God Sounding in darkness and a silent place; The morning dew scarce seen upon the flowers, Yet drawn to heaven and grown the thunder-bolt That shakes the earth at noon. When man's wild soul Clutches no more at the white feet of Christ; When death is not, nor spiritual disease; When atheists can on the black mountain tops Walk solitary in the light of stars, And cry, ‘God is not’; when no mothers kneel Moaning on graves of children; when no flashes Trouble the melancholy dark of dream; When prayer is hush'd, when the Wise Book is shut— Then Rome shall fall indeed: meantime she is based Invulnerable on the soul of man, Its darkest needs and fears; she doth dispense What soon or late is better prized than gold,— Comfort and intercession; for all sin She hath the swiftest shrift, wherefore her clients Are those that have sinned deeply, and of such Is half the dreadful world; all these she holds By that cold eyeball which hath read their souls, So that they look upon her secretly And tremble,—while in her dark book of Fate E'en now she dooms the Teuton. Enter a Messenger. NAPOLEON. Well, what news? MESSENGER. 'Tis brief and sad. The mighty Prussian chiefs, Gathering their fiery van in silence, close Toward the imperial City—in whose walls Treason and Rage and Fear contend together Like hunger-stricken wolves; and at their cry, Echoed from Paris to the Vosges, France, Calling her famish'd children round her knees, Looks at the trembling nations. All is still, Like to that silence which precedes the storm, And shakes the forest leaves without a breath; But surely as the vaporous storm is woven, The German closes round the heart of France His hurricane of lives. NAPOLEON. (To Bishop) The Teuton thrives Under the doom we spake of. (To Messenger) Well, speak on! MESSENGER. Meantime, like kine that see the gathering clouds And shelter 'neath the shade of rocks and trees, Thy timorous people fly before the sound Of the approaching footsteps, seeking woods For shelter, snaring conies for their food, And sleeping like the beasts; some fare in caves, Fearing the wholesome air, hushing the cries Of infants lest the murderous foe should hear; Some scatter west and south, their frighted eyes Cast backward, with their wretched household goods; And where these dwelt, most blest beneath thy rule, The German legions thrive, let loose like swine Amid the fields of harvest, in their track Leaving the smoking ruin, and the church Most desecrated to a sleeping-sty;— So that the plenteous lands that rolled in gold Round thy voluptuous City, lie full bare To shame, to rapine, to calamity. NAPOLEON. O for one hour of empire, that with life I might consume this sorrow! 'Tis a spell By which we are subdued! MESSENGER. Strasbourg still stands, Stubborn as granite, but the citadel Is falling. Within, Famine and Horror nest, And rear their young on ruin. [Exit. Enter a Messenger. NAPOLEON. How, peal on peal! Like the agonising clash of bells when flame Hath seized on some fair city. News, more news? Dost thou too catch the common trick o' the time, And ring a melancholy peal? MESSENGER. My liege, Strasbourg still stands. NAPOLEON. And then? MESSENGER. Pent up in Metz, Encircled by a river of strong lives, Bazaine is faithful to the cause and thee, And from his prison doth proclaim himself, And all the host of Frenchmen at his back, Thy liegemen to the death. NAPOLEON. Why, that last peal Sounds somewhat blither. Well? MESSENGER. From his lone isle The old Italian Red-shirt in his age Hath crawl'd, tho' sickly and infirm, to France, And slowly there his leonine features breed Hope in the timid people, who— NAPOLEON. Enough! [Exit Messenger. That tune is flat and tame. Enter a Messenger. What man art thou Speak! MESSENGER. Better I had died at Weissenburg, Where on the bloody field I lay for dead, Than live to bring this woe. Ungenerous France, Forgetful of thy gracious years of reign, Pitiless as a sated harlot is When ruin overtaketh him whose hand Hath loaded her with gems, shameless and mad, France, like Delilah, now betrays her lord. The streets are drunken—from thy palace-gate They pluck the imperial eagles, trampling them Into the bloody mire; thy flags and pennons, Torn from their vantage in the wind, are wrapt In mockery round the beggar's ragged limbs; And thine imperial images in stone, Dash'd from their lofty places, strew the ground In shameful ruin. All the ragged shout, While Trochu from the presidential seat Proclaims the empire dead, and calleth up A new Republic, in whose chairs of office Thine enemies, scribblers and demagogues, Simon, Gambetta, Favre, and linked with these The miserable Rochefort, trembling grasp The reins of power, unconscious of the scorn, That doth already doom them. To their feet Come humming back, vain-drunken, all the wasps Whom in thine hour of glory thou didst brush With careless arm-sweep from thy festal cup; Shoulder'd by mobs the pigmy Blanc declaims, The hare-brain'd Hugo shrieks a maniac song In concert, and the scribblers, brandishing Their pens like valiant lilliputians Against the Teuton giant, frantically Scream chorus. Coming with mock-humble eyes To the Republic, this sham shape of straw, This stuff'd thing of a harlot's carnival, The dilettante sons of Orleans, kneeling, Proffer forsooth their swords, which being disdain'd They sheathe chapfallen and with bows withdraw Back to their pictures and perfumery. NAPOLEON. Why, thine is news indeed! Nor do I weep For mine own wrong, but for the woes of France, Whose knell thou soundest. With a tongue of fire Our enemy shall like the ant-eater Devour these insect rulers suddenly. (Aside) Now, may the foul fiend blacken all the air Above these Frenchmen, with revolt and fear Darken alike the wits of friends and foes, With swift confusion and with anarchy Disturb their fretful counsels, till at last, Many-tongued, wild-hair'd, mad, and horrible With fiery eyes and naked crimson limbs, Upriseth the old Spectre of the Red, And as of yore lifts up the shameful knife To stab unhappy France; then, in her need, Fearful and terror-stricken, France shall call On him who gave her nineteen plenteous years— And he may rise again. Exeunt. CHORUS OF SPIRITS. Who in the name of France curses French souls this day? How! shall the tempter curse? Silence; and turn away; Turn we our faces hence white with a wild desire, Westward we lift our gaze till the straining balls flash fire, Westward we look to France, sadly we watch and mark:— Far thro' the pitch-black air, like breaking foam in the dark, Cometh and goeth a light across the stricken land, And we hear a distant voice like the wash of waves on the sand. VOICES. Set the cannon on the heights, and under Let the black moat gape, the black graves grow! Now let thunder Answer back the thunder of the foe! France has torn her cerements asunder, France doth live, to strike the oppressor low. CHORUS. O hark! O hark! a voice arises wild and strong, Loud as a bell that rings alarm it lifts the song. See! see! the dark is lit, fire upon fire upsprings, Loudly from town to town the fiery tiding rings. Now the red smithies blaze and the blue steel is sped, They twist bright steel for guns, they cast the fatal lead; Cannon is drawn to the gate,—and lo, the bravest stand Bare to the shoulder there, smoke-begrim'd, fuse in hand; Now to the winds of heaven the Flag of Stars they raise, While those sing martial songs who are too frail for frays. France is uprisen again! France the sworn slayer of Kings! With bleeding breast and bitter heart at the Teuton's throat she springs. VOICES. Now like thunder Be our voice together while we cry! Kings shall never hold our spirits under, Kings shall cast their crowns aside and fly: Latin, Sclav, or Teuton, they shall wonder; The soul of man hath doom'd them—let them die. We have slain Kings of old, they were our own to slay, But now we doom all Kings until the Judgment day, Raise ye the Flag of Stars! Tremble, O Kings, and behold! Raise ye the Flag of man, while the knell of anarchs is tolled. This is a festal day for all the seed of Eve; France shall redeem the world, and heal all hearts that grieve; France with her sword this day shall free all human things, With blood drain'd from her heart our France shall write the doom of Kings. CHORUS. Silence and hearken yet! O but it is a cry Heard under heaven of old, tho' the terrible day blew by. The red fire flames to heaven, and in the crimson glow Black shapes with prayers and cries, are gliding to and fro. VOICES. Fill each loophole with a man! and finding Each a foe, aim slowly at the brain, While the blinding Lightnings flash, and the great guns refrain. To the roofs! and while beneath the foe are winding, Dash ye stones and missiles down like rain. Watch for the gray-beard King: to drink his blood were great. Watch for the Cub thereto—aim at his brain full straight. Watch most for that foul Knave who crawls behind the crown, Who smiles befooling all with crafty eyes cast down; Sweeter than wine indeed his wretched blood would flow, Curst juggler with our souls, he who hath wrought this woe. France hath uprisen again! Let the fierce shaft be sped Till all the foul satanic things that flatter Kings be dead! CHORUS. Echo the dreadful prayer, let the fierce shaft be sped, Till all the foul satanic things that flatter Kings be dead! VOICES. Send the light balloon aloft with singing, Let our hopes rise with it to the sky, Let our voices like one fount upspringing Tell the mighty realm that hope is nigh! See, in answer, from the distance winging Back unto our feet the swift doves fly! CHORUS. We see the City now, dark square and street and mart, The muffled drum doth sound réveille in its heart, The chain'd balloon doth swing, while men stand murmuring by, Then with elastic bound upleaps into the sky. We see the brightening dawn, the dimly dappled land, The shapes with arms outstretch'd that on the housetops stand, The eyes that turn to meet with one quick flash of fear The birds that sad and slow wing nearer and more near. O courage! all is well—yea, let your hearts be higher, North, south, east, west, the souls of Frenchmen are as fire, The reaper leaves the wheat, the workman leaves his loom, Tho' the black priest may frown, who heeds his look of gloom? Flash the wild tidings forth! ring them from town to town, Till like a storm of scythes ye rise, and the foe like wheat go down. VOICES. See! how northward the wild heavens lighten, Red as blood the fierce aurora waves, Let it bathe us strong in blood and brighten Sweet with resurrection on our graves, Lighten, lighten, Scroll of God!—unfold above and brighten, Light the doom of monarchs and their slaves. This is a day indeed—be sure that God can see. Raise the fierce cry again, ‘Liberty! Liberty!’ Courage! No man dies twice, and he shall live in death, Who for the Flag of Stars strikes with his latest breath. Nay, not a foe shall live to tell if France be slain: If the wild cause be lost, only the grave shall gain. Teuton and Frank in fierce embrace shall strew the fatal sod, And they shall live indeed who died to save their souls for God. CHORUS. O Spirits, turn and look no more and hark not to their cry; A Hand is flashed before our eyes, a Shape goes sadly by. And as it goes, it looks on us with eyes that swim in tears, And bitter as the death-cry sounds the echo in our ears. O look no more and seek no more to read the days unborn, 'Tis storm this night on the world's sea, and 'twill be storm at morn. The Lord hath sent His breath abroad, and all the waves are stirr'd: Amid the tempest Liberty flies like a white sea-bird, And, while the heavens are torn apart and the fierce waters gleam, Doth up and down the furrow'd waves dart with a sea-bird's scream. O bow the head, and close the eyes, and pray a quiet prayer, But let the bitter curse of Man go by upon the air. Napoleon. An Officer. NAPOLEON. Is there no hope for France? OFFICER. None. Yet I know not! A nation, thus miraculously strengthen'd, And acting in the fiercest wrath of love, Hath risen ere this above calamity, Yea out of anguish conjured victory. If strength and numbers, if the mighty hands Of the Briareus, shall decide the day, Then surely as the sun sets France must fall; If love or prayer can make a miracle And bring an angel down to strike for her, Then France may rise again. NAPOLEON. Have we not proved Her children cowards? Yea, by God! Like dogs That rend the air with wrath upon the chain, And being loosen'd slink before the thief, They fail'd me—those who led and those who follow'd; Scarce knowing friend from foe, while inch by inch The Germans ate their ranks as a slow fire Devoureth wind-blown wheat. I cannot trust In France or Frenchmen. OFFICER. Sire— NAPOLEON. Why dost thou hang Thy head, old friend, and look upon the ground? Nay, if all Frenchmen had but hearts like thine, Then France were blest in sooth, and I, its master, Were safe against the swords of all the world. OFFICER. Sire, 'twas not that I meant—my life is yours To give or take, to blame or praise; I blush'd Not for myself, but France. NAPOLEON. Then hadst thou cause For crimson cheeks indeed. OFFICER. Sire, as I live, Thou wrongest her! The breast whereon we grew Suckled no cowards. For one dizzy hour France totter'd, and look'd back; but now indeed She hath arisen to the very height Of her great peril. NAPOLEON. 'Tis too late. She is lost; She did betray her master, and shall die. OFFICER. Not France betrayed thee, Sire; but rather those Whom thy most noble nature, royally based Above suspicion and perfidious fear, Welcom'd unto thy council; not poor France, Whose bleeding wounds speak for her loud as tongues, Bit at the hand that raised her up so high; Not France, but bastard Frenchmen, doubly damn'd Alike by her who bare them, and by thee Who fed them. These betrayed thee to thy doom, And falling clutch'd at thine imperial crown, Dragging it with them to the bloody dust; But these that held her arms like bands of lead Being torn from off her, France, unchain'd and free, Uplifts her pale front to the stars, and stands Serene in doom and danger, and sublime In resurrection. NAPOLEON. How the popular taint Corrupts the wholesome matter of thy mind! This would be treason, friend, if we were strong— Now 'tis less perilous: the commonest wind Can blow its scorn upon the fallen. OFFICER. Sire, Behold me on my knees, tears in mine eyes, And sorrow in my heart. My life is thine, My life, my heart, my soul are pledged to thine; And triply now doth thy calamity Hold me thy slave and servant. If I pray, 'Tis that thou mayst arise, and thou shalt rise; And if I praise our common mother, France, Who for the moment hath forgot her lord, 'Tis that my soul rejoices for thy sake, That when thou comest to thine own again Thy realm shall be a realm regenerate, Baptised a fair thing worthy of thy love In its own blood of direful victory. NAPOLEON. Sayest thou?—Rise!—Friend, thou art little skilled In reading that abstruse astrology Whereby our cunning politicians cast The fate of Kings. France robed in victory Is France for ever lost to our great house. France fallen, is France that with my secret hand I may uplift again. But tell thy tale Most freely: let thy soul beat its free wings Before me as it lists. Come! as thou sayest, France is no coward;—she hath at last arisen; Nay, more—she is sublime. Proceed. OFFICER. My liege, God, ere He made me thy most loving servant, Made and baptised me, Frenchman; and my heart, A soldier's heart, yearns out this day in pride To her who bare me, and, both great and low, My brethren. Courage is a virtue, Sire, Even in a wretched cause. In Strasbourg still Old Uhrich with his weight of seventy years Starves unsubdued, while the dull enemy Look on in wonder at such strength in woe; Bazaine still keeps the glittering hosts at bay, And holds them with a watchful hand and eye; The captain of the citadel at Laon, Soon as the foeman gather'd on his walls, Illumed the hidden mine, and Frank and Teuton, With that they strove for, strew'd the path in death; From Paris to the Vosges, loud and wild The tocsin rings to arms, and on the fields The fat ripe ear empties itself unreapt, While every man whose hand can grasp a sword Flocks to the petty standard of his town; The many looms of the great factory Stand silent, but the fiery moulds of clay Are fashioning cannon, and the blinding wheels Are sharpening steel. In every marketplace Peasant and prince are drilling side by side; Roused from their wine-fed torpor, changed from swine To men, the very country burghers arm, Nay, what is more to them than blood, bleed gold, Bounteously, freely. I have heard that priests, Doffing the holy cassock secretly, Shouting uplift the sword, and crying Christ To aid them strike for France. Only the basest, Only the scum, shrink now; for even women, Catching the noble fever of the time, Buckle the war-belts round their lovers' waists, And clapping hands, with mingled cries and sobs, Urge young and old against the enemy. NAPOLEON. Of so much thunder may the lightning spring! I know how France can thunder, and I have felt How women's tongues can urge. But what of Paris? What of the City of Light? How doth it bear The terror and the agony? OFFICER. Most bravely, As doth become the glorious heart of France: Strong, fearless, throbbing with a martial might, Dispensing from its core the vital heat Which filleth all the members of the land; Though even now the sharp steel pricks the skin, To stab it in its strength. NAPOLEON. Who holds the reins Within the gates? OFFICER. Trochu. NAPOLEON. Still? Why, how long Have the poor fools been constant? Favre also? Gambetta? Rochefort? All these gentlemen Still flourish? And Thiers? Hath the arch-schemer A seat among the gods, a place of rank With the ephemera? OFFICER. Not so, my liege. NAPOLEON. Well, being seated on Olympus' top, What thunderbolts are France's puny Joves Casting abroad? Or do they sit and quake For awe of their own voices, which in France, As in the shifting glaciers of the Alps, May bring the avalanche upon their heads? OFFICER. The men, to do them justice, use their power Calmly and soldierly, and for a time Forget the bitter humours of the senate In the great common cause. Paris is strong, And full of noble souls. NAPOLEON. Paris must fall. OFFICER. Not soon, my liege—for she is belted round And arm'd impregnable on every side. Hunger and thirst may slay her, not the sword; And ere the foeman's foot is heard within, Paris will spring upon her funeral pyre And follow Hope to heaven. Last week I walk'd Reading men's faces in the silent streets, And, as I am a soldier, saw in none Fear or capitulation: very harlots Cried in their shame the name of Liberty, And, hustled from the gates, shriek'd out a curse Upon the coming Teuton: all was still And dreadful; but the citizens in silence Drilled in the squares; on the great boulevard groups Whisper'd together, with their faces pale At white heat; in the silent theatre, Dim lit by lamps, were women, wives and mothers, Silently working for their wounded sons And husbands; in the churches too they sat And wrought, while ever and anon a foot Rung on the pavement, and with sad red eyes They turn'd to see some armëd citizen Kneel at his orisons or vespers. Nightly, Ere the moon rose, the City slept like death: Yet as a lion sleeps, with half-shut eyes, Hearing each murmur on the weary wind, Crouching and ready for the spring. Each dawn I saw the country carts come rumbling in, And the scared country-folk, with large wild eyes And open mouths, who flock'd for shelter, bringing Horrible tidings of the enemy Who had devoured their fields and happy homes. Then suddenly like a low earthquake came The rumour that the foe was at the gates; And climbing a cathedral roof that night, I saw the pitch-black distance sown with fire Gleam phosphorescent like the midnight sea, And heard at intervals mysterious sounds, Like far-off thunder, or the Atlantic waves Clashing on some great headland in a storm, Come smother'd from afar. But, lingering yet, I haunted the great City in disguise, While silently the fatal rings were wound Around about it by the Teuton hosts: Still, as I am a soldier, saw no face That look'd capitulation: rather saw The knitted eyebrow and the clenchëd teeth, The stealthy hand that fingered with the sword. The eye that glanced as swift as Hunger's doth Towards the battlements. Then (for at last A voice was raised against my life) I sought Trochu, my schoolfellow and friend in arms, And, though his brow darkened a moment's space, He knew me faithful and reached out his hand To save me. By his secret help I found A place in a balloon, that in the dusk Ere daylight rose upon a moaning wind And drifted southward with the drifting clouds; And as the white and frosty daylight grew, And opening crimson as a rose's leaves The clouds to eastward parted, I beheld The imperial City, gables, roofs, and spires, White and fantastic as a city of dream, Gleam orient, while the muffled drums within Sounded réveille; then a red flash and wreath Of vapour broke across the outer line, Where the back fortifications frowning rose Ring above ring around the imperial gates, And flash on flash succeeded with a sound Most faint and lagging wearily behind. Still all without the City seemed as husht As sleep or death. But as the reddening day Scattered the mists, the tiny villages Loomed dim; and there were distant glimmerings, And far-off muffled sounds: yet scarce a sign Showed the innumerable enemy,— Who snugly housed and canopied with stone Lay hidden in their strength; only the watch-fire Gleam'd here and there, only from place to place Masses of shadow seem'd to move, and light Was glimmered dimly back from hidden steel; And, woefullest sight of all, miles to the west, Along the dark line of the foe's advance, On the straight rim where earth and heaven meet, The forests blazed, and to the driving clouds Cast blood-red phantoms growing dim in day. Meantime, like one whirl'd in a dizzy dream, Onward we drove below the driving cloud, And from the region of the burning fire And smouldering hamlet rose still higher, and saw The white stars like to tapers burning out Above the region of the nether storm, And the illimitable ether growing Silent and dark in the deep wintry dawn. Enter a Messenger. MESSENGER. Most weighty news, my liege, from Italy. NAPOLEON. Yes? MESSENGER. Rome is taken. The imperial walls Yawn where the cannon smote; in the red street Romans embracing shout for Liberty; From Florence to Messina bonfires blaze, And rockets rise and wild shouts shake the air; And with the thunder in his aged ears, Surrounded by his cold-eyed Cardinals, Clutching his spiritual crown more close, Trembling with dotage, sits the grey-haired Pope Anathematising in the Vatican. [Exit. OFFICER. Woe to the head on whom his curse shall fall, For in the day of judgment it shall be Better with Sodom and Gomorrah. Wait! This is the twilight; red will rise the dawn. NAPOLEON. Peace, friend; yet if it ease thy heart, speak on. I would to God, I did believe in God As thou dost. Twilight surely—'tis indeed A twilight—and therein from their fair spheres Kings shoot like stars. How many nights of late The heavens have troubled been with fiery signs, With characters like monstrous hieroglyphs, And the aurora, brighter than the day And red as blood, has burst from west to east. OFFICER. I do believe the melancholy air Is full of pain and portent. NAPOLEON. Would to God I had more faith in God, for in this work I fail to trace His hand; but rather feel The nether-shock of earthquake everywhere Shaking old thrones and new, those rear'd on rock As well as those on sand. All darkens yet, And in that darkness, while with cheeks of snow The affrighted people gaze at one another, The Teuton still, mouthing of Deity, Works steadfastly to some mysterious end. My heart was never Rome's so much as now, Now, when she shares my cup of agony. Agony! Is this agony? then indeed All life is agony. OFFICER. Your Imperial Highness Is suffering! Take comfort, Sire. NAPOLEON. It is nought— Only a passing spasm at the heart— 'Tis my disease, comrade; 'tis my disease! So leave me: it is late; and I would rest. OFFICER. God in his gracious goodness give thee health! NAPOLEON. Pray that He may; for I am deeply sick— Too sick for surgery—too sick for drugs— Too sick for man to heal. 'Tis a complaint Incident to our house; and of the same [Exit Officer. Mine imperial uncle died. France in the dust, With the dark Spectre of the Red above her! Rome fallen! Aye me, well may the face of heaven Burn like a fiery scroll. Had I but eyes To read whose name is written next for doom! The Teuton's? Oh the Serpent, that has bided His time so long, and now has stabbed so deep! Would I might bruise his head before I die! Exit. Night. Napoleon sleeping. Chorus of Spirits. A VOICE. What shapes are ye whose shades darken his rest this night? CHORUS. Cold from the grave we come, out of the dark to the light. A VOICE. Voices ye have that moan, and eyes ye have that weep, Ah! woe for him who feels such shadows round his sleep! CHORUS. Tho' thou wert buried and dead, Still would we seek thee and find thee, Ever there follows the tread Of feet from the tomb behind thee; Sleep, shall thy soul have sleep? Nay, but be broken and shaken. Gather around him and weep, Trouble him till he awaken. A VOICE. Who, in imperial raiment, darkly frowning stand, Laurel-leaves in their hair, sceptred, yet sword in hand? ANOTHER VOICE. Who in their shadow looms, woman eyed, woe-begone, And bares his breast to show the piteous wounds thereon? CHORUS. Peace, they are Kings, they are crowned; Kings, tho' their realms have departed, Realms of the grave they have found, And they walk in the same heavy-hearted. Sleep? did their souls have sleep? Nay, for like his was their being. Gather around him and weep, Awake him to hearing and seeing. SPIRIT OF CÆSAR. Greater than thou I fell. Die; for thy day is o'er. Thou reap the world with swords? thou wear the robe I wore? Up like the bird of Jove, I rose from height to height, Poised on the heavenly air, eyes to the blood-red light; Swift came the flash of wrath, one long-avenging glare— Down like a stone I fell, down thro' the dizzy air; Dark burnt the heaven above, red ran the light of day, In the great square of Rome, bloody I fell, and lay. CHORUS. Kings of the realms of fear, Each the sad ghost of the other, One by one step near, Look in the eyes of a brother. Hush! draw nearer and speak— And ere he waketh each morrow Blow on his bloodless cheek With the chilly wind of your sorrow. SPIRIT OF BUONAPARTE. Greater than thou I fell. Die, Icarus, and give place. Thou take from my cold grave the glory and the grace! Out of the fire I came, onward thro' fire I strode; Under my path earth burnt, o'er it the pale stars glow'd; Sun of the earth, I leapt up thro' the wondering sky, Naming my name with God's, Kings knelt as I went by. Aye; but my day declined;—to one glad cry of the free My blood-red sunset died on the eternal Sea. A VOICE. What spirit art thou, with cold, still smile and face like snow? SPIRIT. Orsini; and avenged. Too soon I struck the blow. A VOICE. And thou, with bleeding breast and eyes that roll in pain? SPIRIT. I am that Maximilian, miserably slain. A VOICE. And ye, O shadowy things, featureless wild, and stark? VOICES. We are the nameless ones whom he hath slain in the dark. A VOICE. Ye whom this man hath doom'd, Spirits, are ye all there? CHORUS. Not yet; they come, they come—they darken all the air. A VOICE. O latest come, and what are ye? Why do ye moan and call? CHORUS. O hush! O hush! they come to speak the bitterest curse of all. SPIRITS. With Sin and Death our mothers' milk was sour, The womb wherein we grew from hour to hour Gather'd pollution dark from the polluted frame— Beside our cradles naked Infamy Caroused, and Lust sat smiling hideously— We grew like evil weeds apace, and knew not shame. With incantations and with spells most rank, The fount of Knowledge where we might have drank, And learnt to love the taste, was hidden from our eyes; And if we learn'd to spell out written speech, Thy slaves were by, and we had books to teach Falsehood and Filth and Sin, Blasphemies, Scoffs, and Lies. We drank of poison, ev'n as flowers drink dew; We ate and drank of poison till we grew Noxious, polluted, black, like that whereon we fed; We never felt the light and the frec wind— Sunless we grew, and deaf, and dumb, and blind— How should we dream of God, souls that were slain and dead? Love with her sister Reverence passed our way As angels pass, unseen, but did not stay— We had no happy homes wherein to bid them dwell; We turn'd from God's blue heaven with eyes of beast, We heard alike the atheist and the priest, And both these lied alike to smooth our hearts for Hell. Of some, both Soul and Body died; of most, The Body fatten'd on, while the poor ghost, Prison'd from the sweet day, was withering in woe; Some robed in purple quaff'd their fatal cup, Some out of rubied goblets drank it up— We did not know God was; but now, O God, we know. Lambs of thy flock, but oh! not white and fair; Beasts of the field, tamed to thy hand, we were; Not men and women—nay, not heirs to light and truth: Some fattening ate and fed; some lay at ease; Some fell and linger'd of a long disease; But all look'd on the ground—beasts of the field forsooth. Ah woe, ah woe, for those thy sceptre swayed, Woe most for those whose bodies, fair arrayed, Insolent, sat at ease, smiled at thy feet of pride; Woe for the harlots with their painted bliss! Woe for the red wine-oozing lips they kiss! Woe for the Bodies that lived, woe for the Souls that died! SEMI-CHORUS I. Tho' thou wert buried and dead, Still would they seek thee and find thee. Ever there follows the tread Of feet from the grave behind thee. SPIRIT OF HORTENSE. Woe! woe! woe! SEMI-CHORUS II. Ye who saw sad light fall, Thro' the chink of the dungeon gleaming, And watch'd your shade on the wall Till it took a sad friend's seeming; Ye who in speechless pain Fled from the doom and the danger, And dragging a patriot's chain Died in the land of the stranger; Men who stagger'd and died, Even as beasts in the traces, Women he set aside For the trade of polluting embraces, Say, shall his soul have sleep, Or shall it be troubled and shaken? CHORUS. Gather around him and weep, Trouble him till he awaken. NAPOLEON (awakening). Who's there? Who speaks?—All silent. O how slowly Moveth the dark and melancholy night! I cannot rest—I am too sick at heart— I have had ill dreams. The inevitable Eyes Are watching, and the weary void of sleep Hath voices strangely sad. [He rises, and paces the chamberO those dark years Of Empire! He who tames the tiger, and lies Pillow'd upon its neck in a lone cave, Is safer. Who could sleep on such a bed? Mine eyes were ever dry of the pure dew God scatters on the lids of happy men; Watching with fascinated gaze the orbs, Ring within ring of blank and bestial light, Where the wild fury slept: seeking all arts To soothe the savage instinct in its throes Of passionate unrest. One cold hand held Sweet morsels for the furious thing to lap, And with the other, held behind my back, I clutch'd the secret steel: oft, lest its teeth Should fasten on its master, cunningly Turning its wrath against the shapes that moved Outside its splendid lair! until at last, Let forth to the mad light of War, it sprang Shrieking and sought to rend me. O thou beast! Art thou so wild this day? and dost thou thirst To fix on thine imperial ruler's throat? Why, have I bidden thee ‘down,’ and thou hast crouch'd Tamely as any hound! Thou shalt crouch yet. And bleed with shamefuller stripes! Let me be calm, Not bitter. 'Tis too late for bitterness. Yet I could gnaw my heart to think how France Hath fail'd me! nay, not France, but rather those Whom to high offices and noble seats In France's name I raised. I bought their souls— What soul can power not buy?—and, having lost The blessed measure of all human truth, Being soulless, these betrayed me; yea, became A brood of lesser tigers hungering With their large eyes on mine. I did not build My throne on sand; no, no,—on Lies and Liars, Weaker than sand a thousandfold! In this I did not work for evil. Tho' my means Were dark and vile perchance, the end I sought Was France's weal, and underneath my care She grew as tame as any fatted calf. I never did believe in that stale cry Raised by the newsman and the demagogue, Though for mine ends I could cry ‘Liberty!’ As loud as any man. The draff of men Are as mere sheep and kine, with heads held down Grazing, or resting blankly ruminant. These must be tended, must be shepherded. But Frenchmen are as wild things scarcely tamed, Brute like yet fierce, mad too with some few hours Of rushing freely with an angry roar. These must be awed and driven. By a scourge Dripping with sanguine drops of their own blood, I awed them: then I drove them: then in time I tamed them. Fool! deeming them wholly mine, I sought to snatch a little brief repose; But with a groan they found me, and I woke; And since they seem'd to suffer pain I said ‘Loosen the yoke a little,’ and 'twas done, And they could raise their heads and gaze at me And the wild hunger deepen'd in their eyes, While fascinated on my throne I sat Forcing a melancholy smile of peace. O had I held the scourge in my right hand, Tighten'd the yoke instead of loosening, It had not been so ill with me as now! But Pity found me with her sister Fear, And lured me. He who sitteth on a throne Should have no counsellors who come in tears; But rather that still voice within his brain, Imperturbable as his own cold eyes And viewless as his coldly-flowing blood; Rather a heart as strong as the great heart Driving the hot life through a lion's thews; Rather a will that moves to its desire As steadfast as the silent-footed cloud. What peevish humour did my mother mix With that immortal ichor of our race Which unpolluted fill'd mine uncle's veins? He lash'd the world's Kings to his triumph-car And sat like marble while the fiery wheels Dript blood beneath him: tho' the live earth shriek'd Below him, he was calm, and like a god Cold to the eloquence of human tears, Cold to the quick, cold as the light of stars, Cold as the hand of Death on the damp brow, Cold as Death brooding on a battle-field In the white after-dawn,—from west to east Royal he moved as the red wintry sun. He never flatter'd Folly at his feet; He never sought to syrup Infamy; He, when the martyrs curst him, drew around him The purple of his glory and passed on Indifferently like Olympian Jove. There was no weak place in the steel he wore, Where women's tongues might reach his mighty heart As they have reach'd at mine. O had I kept A heart of steel, a heart of adamant; Had I been deaf to clamour and the peal Of peevish fools; had I for one strong hour Conjured mine uncle's soul to mix with mine, Sedan had never slain me! I am lost By the damn'd implements mine own hands wrought— Things that were made as slavish tools of peace, Never as glittering weapons meet for war. He never stoop'd to use such peaceful tools; But, for all uses, Made the sword serve him—yea, for sceptre and scythe; Nay more, for Scripture and for counsellor! Yet he too fell. Early or late, all fall. No fruit can hang for ever on the tree. Daily the tyrant and the martyr meet Naked at Death's door, with the fatal mark Both brows being branded. Doth the world then slay Only its anarchs? Doth the lightning flash Smite Cæsar and spare Brutus? Nay, by heaven! Rather the world keeps for its paracletes Torture more subtle and more piteous doom Than it dispenses to its torturers. Tiberius, with his foot on the world's neck, Smileth his cruel smile and groweth grey, Half dead already with the weight of years Drinking the death he is too frail to feel, While in his noon of life the Man Divine Hath died in anguish at Jerusalem. [He opens a Life of Jesus and reads. A long pause. Here too the Teuton works, crafty and slow, Anatomising, gauging, questioning, Till that fair Presence which redeem'd the world Dwindles into a phantom and a name. Shall he slay Kings, and spare the King of Kings? In her fierce madness France denied her God, But still the Teuton doth destroy his God Coldly as he outwits an enemy. Yet doth he keep the Name upon his lips, And coldly dedicating the dull deed To the abstraction he hath christen'd ‘God,’ To the creation of his cogent brain, Conjures against the blessed Nazarene, That pallid apparition masculine, That shining orb hemm'd in with clouds of flesh; Till, darken'd with the woe of his own words, The fool can turn to Wilhelm's wooden face And Bismarck's crafty eyes, and see therein Human regeneration, or at least The Teuton's triumph mightier than Christ's. Lie there, Iconoclast! Thou art thrice a fool, Who, having nought to set within its place But civic doctrine and a naked sword, Would tear from out its niche the piteous bust Of Him whose face was Sorrow's morning star. [Takes up a second Book, and reads. Mark, now, how speciously Theology, Leaving the broken fragments of the Life Where the dull Teuton's hand hath scatter'd them, Takes up the cause in her high fields of air. ‘Darkness hath lain upon the earth like blood, And in the darkness human things had shriek'd And felt for God's soft hand, and agonised. But overhead the awful Spirit heard, Yet stirr'd not on His throne. Then lastly, One Dropt like a meteor stone from suns afar, And stirred and stretch'd out hands, and lived, and knew That He indeed had dropt from suns afar, That He had fallen from the Father's breast Where He had slumber'd for eternities. Hither in likeness of a Man He came— He, Jesus, wander'd forth from heaven and said, “Lo, I, the deathless one, will live and die! Evil must suffer—Good ordains to suffer— Our point of contact shall be suffering, There will we meet, and ye will hear my voice; And my low tones shall echo on thro' time, And one salvation proved in fatal tears Be the salvation of Humanity.”’ Ah, old Theology, thou strikest home! ‘Evil must suffer—Good ordains to suffer’— Sayst thou? Did He then quaff His cup of tears Freely, who might have dash'd it down, and ruled? The world was ready with an earthly crown, And yet He wore it not. Ah, He was wise. Had He but sat upon a human throne, With all the kingdom's beggars at His feet, And all its coffers open at His side, He had died more shameful death, yea, He had fallen Even as the Cæsars. Rule the world with Love? Tame savage human nature with a kiss? Turn royal cheeks for the brute mob to smite? He knew men better, and He drew aside, Ordain'd to do and suffer, not to reign. My good physician bade me search in books For solace. Can I find it? Verily, From every page of all man's hand hath writ A dark face frowns, a voice moans ‘Vanity!’ There is one Book—one only—that for ever Passeth the understanding and appeaseth The miserable hunger of the heart— Behold it—written with the light of stars By God in the beginning. [Looks forth. A starry night. I believe God is, but more I know not, save but this— He passeth not as men and systems pass, For while all change the Law by which they change Survives and is for ever, being God. Our sin, our loss, our misery, our death, Are but the shadows of a dream: the hum Within our ears, the motes within our eyes; Death is to us a semblance and an end, But is as nothing to that Central Law Whereby we cannot die. Yonder blue dome, Gleaming with meanings mystically wrought, Hath been from the beginning, and shall be Until the end. How many awe-struck eyes Have look'd and spelt one word—the name of God, And call'd it as they listed, Law, Fate, Change, And marvell'd for its meaning till they died, And others came and stood upon their graves And read in their turn, and marvelling gave place. The Kings of Israel watch'd it with wild orbs, Madden'd, and cried the Name, and drew the sword. Above the tented plain of Troy it bent After the sun of day had set in blood. The superstitious Roman look'd by night And trembled. All these faded phantom-like, And lo! where it remaineth, watch'd with eyes As sad as any of those this autumn night,— The Higher Law writ with the light of Stars By God in the beginning. . . . Let me sleep! Or I shall gaze and gaze till I grow wild And never sleep again. Too much of God Maketh the heart sick. Come then forth, thou charm, Thou silent spell wrung from the blood-red flower, With power to draw the curtains of the soul And shut the inevitable Eyes away. Dead mother, at thy knees I said a prayer— Lead me not into temptation, and, O God, Deliver me from evil. Is it too late To murmur it this night? This night, O God, Whate'er Thou art and wheresoe'er Thou art, This night at least, when I am sick and fallen, Deliver me from evil! CHORUS. Under the Master's feet the generations Like ants innumerably come and go: He leans upon a Dial, and in patience Watches the hours crawl slow. In His bright hair the eternal stars are burning, Around His face Heaven's glories burn sublime: He heeds them not, but follows with eyes yearning The Shadow men call Time. Some problem holds Him, and He follows dreaming The lessening and lengthening of the shade.— Under His feet, ants from the dark earth streaming, Gather the men He made. He heeds them not nor turns to them His features— They rise, they crawl, they strive, they run, they die; How should He care to look upon such creatures, Who lets great worlds roll by? He shall be nowise heard who calls unto Him, He shall be nowise seen who seeks His face; The problem holds Him—no mere man may woo Him, He pauseth in His place. So hath it been since all things were created, No change on the immortal Face may fall, Having made all, God paused, and fascinated, Watch'd Time, the shade of all. Call to the Maker in thine hour of trial, Call with a voice of thunder like the sea: He watches living shadows on a Dial, And hath no ears for thee. He watches on—He feels the still hours fleeing, He heeds thee not, but lets the days drift by; And yet we say to thee, O weary being, Blaspheme not, lest thou die. Rather, if woe be deep and thy soul wander, Ant among ants that swarm upon a sod, Watching thy shadow on the grass-blade, ponder The mystery with God. So may some comfort reach thy soul way-faring, While the days run and the swift glories shine, And something God-like shall that soul grow, sharing The attitude divine. Silent, supreme, sad, wondering, quiescent, Seeking to fathom with the spirit-sight The problem of the Shadow of the Present Born of eternal Light. THE TEUTON MONOLOGUE. (1870.) To stand this night alone with Destiny, Alone in all the world beneath the stars, And hold the string that makes the puppets dance, Is something; but to feel the steadfast will Deepen, the judgment clear itself, the gaze Grow keener, all the purpose that was dim Brighten distinct in the serene still light Of conquest—that is more; more than all power, More than lip-homage, more than crowns and thrones, More than the world; for it is life indeed. O how the dreams and hopes and plans cohere! How the great phalanx broadens! Like a wave It washes Europe, and before its sweep The lying idols, based on quicksand, shift, Totter, and fall: strewn with the wreck'd and dead, It shrieks and gathers up a flashing crest In act to drown the lingering life of France. Tide of the Teuton, is it wonderful The grand old King sees in thy victory The strength and wrath of God? Here then I pause, And (let me whisper it to mine own heart) I tremble. I have played with fire; behold, It hath devour'd God's enemy and mine; And tamely at my bidding croucheth now With luminous eyes half closed. This fire is Truth, And by it I shall rise or fall. This fire Is very God's—I know it; and thus far God to my keeping hath committed it. What next? and next? There at my feet lies France, Bound, stricken, screaming,—yonder, good as dead. Pluckt of his fangs, the imperial Adder crawls, Tame as a mouse. I have struck down these twain, The Liar, and the creature of the Liar; I have slain these twain with an avenging flame; And while I stand victorious comes a Voice Out of the black abysses of the earth Whereat I pause and tremble. 'Tis so easy To cast down Idols! The tide so pitilessly Washes each name from the waste sands of time! 'Twas yestermorn the Man of Mysteries fell— Whose turn comes next? . . . From Italy to the blue Baltic rolls A voice, a wind, a murmur in the air, A tone full of the sense of wind and waters And the faint whispers from ethereal fields, A cry of anguish and of mystery Echoed by the Volcano in whose depths The monarchs one by one have disappeared. And men who hear it answer back one word, ‘Liberty!’—Cities echo through their streets; The word is wafted on from vale to vale: Heart-drowsy Albion answers with a cheer, Feeble yet clear; the great wild West refrains; Italy thunders, and Helvetia Blows the wild horn high up among her hills; France, wounded, dying, stretch'd beneath my feet, Gnaws at her bonds and shrieks in mad accord (For she indeed first gave the thing a name), And even the wily Russian, with his yoke Prest on innumerable groaning necks, Sleek like the serpent, smooths his frosty cheek To listen, fiercely smiling hisses back The strange word ‘Liberty!’ between his teeth, And shivers with a bitterer sense of cold Than ever seized him in that lonely realm O'er which he paceth hungry and alone. What is this thing that men call ‘Liberty’? Not force, not tumult, not the wind and rain And tempest, not the spirit of mere Storm, Not Earthquake, not the Lightning, not swift Fire, Not one of these; but mightier far than these,— The everlasting principle of things, Out of whose silence issue all, the rock Whereon the mountain and the crater stand, The adamantine pillars of the Earth, Deep-based beneath the ever-varying air And under the wild changes of the Sea, The Inevitable, the Unchangeable, The secret law, the impulse, and the thought, Whereby men live and grow. Then I, this night As ever, dare with a man's eyes and soul Hold by this thing whereof the foolish rave, And cry, ‘In God's name, peace, ye winds and waves, Ye froths and bubbles on the sea, ye voices Haunting the fitful region of the air! God is above ye all, and next to God The Son and Holy Spirit, and beneath These twain the great anointed Kings of Earth, And underneath the Kings the Wise of Wit, And underneath the Wise the merely Strong, And least of all, clay in the hands of all, The base, the miserable, and the weak.’ What, then, is this that ye name ‘Liberty’? There is evermore a higher. Not like waves Beating about in a waste sea are men, But great, small, fair, foul, strong, weak, miserable;— And Liberty is law creating law Wherein each corporal member of the world Filleth his function in the place ordain'd. Child at the knee, look in thy mother's face! Boy-student, reverence the philosopher! Clown, till the earth, and let the market thrive! Citizen, doff to beauty and to grace, To antique fame and holy ancestry! Nobles, blood purified from running long, Circle of sanctity, surround the King! King, stand on the bare height and raise thine eyes, For there sits God above thee, reverencing The perfect Mirror of the soul of things, Wherein He gazes calmly evermore, And knows Himself divine! Thus stands for ever The eternal Order like a goodly Tree, The root of which is deep within the soil. And lo! the wind and rain are beating on it, And lightning rends its branches; yet anon It hangs in gorgeous blossom still-renewed, And shoots its topmost twig up through the cloud To touch the changeless stars. Herr Democrat Comes with his blunt rough axe, and at its root Strikes shrieking; the earth's parrots echo him; Blow follows blow; the air reverberates; But the Tree stands. Come winds and waves and lightnings, Come axe-wielders, come ye iconoclasts, And spend your strength in vain. What! ye would stretch This goodly trunk, this very Iggdrasil, Down to the dusty level of your lives, Would strew the soil with the fair blooms thereof, Would tear away the succulent leaves and make A festal chaplet for Silenus' hair, A drunken garland for the Feast of Fools. See, yonder blow the branches where the Great Tremble like ripen'd fruit; yonder the Holy Gleam in the silvern foliage, sweet and fair; There just beneath the cloud, most dim in height, The flowers of monarchy open their buds And turn their starry faces upward still. Strike at the root, my little democrat, Down with them! Down with the whole goodly Tree! Down even with that fair shoot beyond the cloud, Down with the unseen bloom of perfect height, Down with the blossom on the topmost twig, Down with the light of God! I compare further This Order to a Man, body and brain, Heart, lungs, eyes, feet to stand on, hands to strike. The King is to the realm what conscience is To manhood: the true statesman is the brain; And under these subsist, greater and less, The members of the body politic. Behold now, this alone is majesty: The incarnate Conscience of the people, fixed Beyond the body, higher than the brain, Yet perfect fruit of both,—the higher sense That flashes back through all the popular frame The intuitions and the lights divine Whereby the world is guided under God. Nor are all Kings ancestral, though these same Are highest. Yonder in the stormy West The plain man Lincoln rose to majesty, Incarnated the conscience and the will Of the strong generation, moved to his end, Struck, triumph'd in the name of Conscience, fell, And like a sun that sets in bloody light, In dying darken'd half earth's continents. . . . What, art thou there, old Phantom of the Red? Urge on thy dreadful legions, for in truth There is no face in France this day with light So troublous to the eyes of victory. O brave one, wert thou France's will and soul, Why we might tremble. Let there rise a land, As strong in conscience and as stern in soul As we have been to follow a living truth, And it might slay us even as we have slain Imperial France and the Republic. Now Supreme we stand, our symbol being the Sword, Our King the hand that wields; in that one hand I strike, all strike, yea every Teuton strikes. Reason and conscience knitted in accord Are deathless, and must overcome the world. The higher law will shape them. I believe There is evermore a higher! THE REPLY. Blue arc of heaven whose lattices Are throng'd with starry eyes; Vast dome that over land and seas Dost luminously rise, With mystic characters enwrought More strange than all poetic thought! Hear, Heaven, if thou canst hear! and see, O stars, if see ye can! Mark, while your speechless mystery Flows to a Voice in man: He stands erect this solemn hour In reverent insolence of power. Order divine, whose awful show Dazzles all guess or dream; Sequence unseen, whose mystic flow Fulfils the immortal scheme; Thou Law whereby all stand or stir,— Here breathes your last interpreter! Because one foolish King hath slain Another foolish King; Because a half-born nation's brain With dizzy joy doth ring; Because at the false Shepherd's cry The silly sheep still throng to die; Because purblind Philosophy Out of her cobweb'd cave Croaks in a voice of senile glee While empty patriots rave; Because humanity is still The gull of any daring will; Because the Tinsel Order stands A little longer yet; Because in each crown'd puppet's hands A laurel-sprig is set, While the old lame device controls The draff of miserable souls; Because man's blood again bathes bright The purple and the throne, And gray fools gladden at the sight, And maiden choirs intone; Because once more the puppet Kings Dance, while Death's lean hand pulls the strings; Because these things have been and are, And oft again may be, Doth this man swear by sun and star, And oh our God by Thee, Framing to cheat his own shrewd eyes His fair cosmogony of lies. O Lord our God whose praise we sing, Behold he deemeth Thee A little nobler than the King, And greater in degree, Set just above the monarch's mind, Greater in sphere but like in kind! O calm Intelligence divine, Transcending life and death, He deems these bursting bubbles Thine, Blown earthward by Thy breath,— He marks Thee sitting well content, Like some old King at tournament. The lists are set; upon the sod The gleaming columns range; The sign is given by Thee, O God, From Thy Pavilion strange: The trumpets blow, the champions meet, One screams—Thou smilest on Thy seat. Behold, O God, the Order blest Of Thy great chivalry! See tinsel crown and glittering crest, Cold heart and empty eye! The living shout, the dying groan, All reddens underneath Thy throne! Accept Thy chosen! great and good, Vouchsafe them all they seek! Deepen their purple in man's blood! Trumpet them with man's shriek! Paint their escutcheons fresh, O Sire; With heart's blood bright and crimson fire! And further, from the fire they light Protect them with Thy hand, Beyond the bright hill of the fight Let them in safety stand; For 'twere not well a random blow Should strike Thy next-of-kin below. O God! O Father! Lord of All! Spare us, for we blaspheme, See,—for upon our knees we fall, And hush our mocking scream— Let us pray low; let us pray low; Thy will be done; Thy Kingdom grow! Blue arc of heaven whose lattices Are throng'd with starry eyes, Still dome that over earth and seas Doth luminously rise; Fair Order mystically wrought, More strange than all poetic thought. He fears ye all, this son of man, To his own soul he lies, Lo! trembling at his own dark plan He contemplates the prize: He has won all, and lo! he stands Clutching the glory in his hands! To one, to all, on life's dark way, Sooner or late is brought The silent solemnising ray Illuminating thought; It shines, they stand on some lone spot, Its light is strange, they know it not. Sleeps, like a mirror in the dark, The Conscience of the Soul, Unknown, where never eye may mark, While days and seasons roll; But late or soon the walls of clay Are loosening to admit the day. Light comes—a touch—a streak—a beam— Child of the unknown sky— And lo! the Mirror with a gleam Flashes its first reply: Light brighteneth: and all things fair Flow to the glass and tremble there. O Lord our God, Thou art the Light, We shine by Thee alone; Tho' Thou hast made us mirrors bright, The gleam is not our own; Until Thy ray shines sweet and plain All shall be dark as this man's brain. Thro' human thought as thro 'a cave Creep gently, Light, this hour; Tho' now 'tis darker than the grave, There lies the shining power; Come! let the Soul flash back to Thee The million lights of Deity! THE CITY OF MAN. Comfort, O free and true! Soon shall there rise for you A City fairer far than all ye plan; Built on a rock of strength, It shall arise at length, Stately and fair and vast, the City meet for Man! Towering to yonder skies Shall the fair City rise, Dim in the dawning of a day more pure: House, mart, and street, and square, Yea, and a Fane for prayer— Fair, and yet built by hands, strong, for it shall endure. In the fair City then Shall walk white-robëd men, Wash'd in the river of peace that watereth it; Woman with man shall meet Freely in mart and street— At the great council-board woman with man shall sit. Hunger and Thirst and Sin Shall never pass therein; Fed with pure dews of love, children shall grow. Fearless and fair and free, Honour'd by all that see, Virgins in golden zones shall walk as white as snow. There, on the fields around, All men shall till the ground, Corn shall wave yellow, and bright rivers stream; Daily, at set of sun, All, when their work is done, Shall watch the heavens yearn down and the strange starlight gleam. In the fair City of men All shall be silent then, While, on a reverent lute, gentle and low, Some holy Bard shall play Music divine, and say Whence those that hear have come, whither in time they go. No man of blood shall dare Wear the white mantle there; No man of lust shall walk in street or mart;— Yet shall the Magdalen Walk with the citizen; Yet shall the sinner stand gracious and pure of heart. Now, while days come and go, Doth the fair City grow, Surely its stones are laid in sun and moon. Wise men and pure prepare Ever this City fair. Comfort, O ye that weep; it shall arise full soon. When, stately, fair, and vast, It doth uprise at last, Who shall be King thereof, say, O ye wise?— When the last blood is spilt, When the fair City is built, Unto the throne thereof the Monarch shall arise. Flower of blessedness, Wrought out of heart's distress, Light of all dreams of saintly men who died, He shall arise some morn One Soul of many born, Lord of the realms of peace, Heir of the Crucified! O but he lingereth, Drawing mysterious breath In the dark depths where he was cast as seed. Strange was the seed to sow, Dark is the growth and slow; Still hath he lain for long—now he grows quick indeed. Quicken, O Soul of Man! Perfect the mystic plan— Come from the flesh where thou art darkly wrought; Wise men and pure prepare Ever thy City fair— Come when the City is built, sit on the Throne of Thought. Earth and all things that be, Wait, watch, and yearn for thee, To thee all loving things stretch hands bereaven;— Perfect and sweet and bright, Lord of the City of Light, Last of the flowers of Earth, first of the fruits of Heaven! Songs of the Terrible Year. (1870.) These ‘Songs,’ inasmuch as they formed a portion of the ‘Drama of Kings,’ preceded by a long period the publication of Victor Hugo's series under the same admirable title. The ‘Drama of Kings’ was written under a false conception, which no one discarded sooner than the author; but portions of it are preserved in the present collection, because, although written during the same feverish and evanescent excitement, they are the distinct lyrical products of the author's mind, and perfectly complete in themselves.—R.B. ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF AUGUSTE COMTE. (1871.) Spirit of the great brow! Fire hath thy City now: She shakes the sad world with her troubled scream! O spirit who loved best This City of the West, Hark! loud she shattered cries—great Queen of thy great Dream. But, as she passes by To the earth's scornful cry, What are those Shapes who walk behind so wan?— Martyrs and prophets born Out of her night and morn: Have we forgot them yet?—these, the great friends of Man. We name them as they go, Dark, solemn-faced, and slow— Voltaire, with saddened mouth, but eyes still bright, Turgot, Malesherbes, Rousseau, Lafayette, Mirabeau— These pass and many more, heirs of large realms of Light. Greatest and last pass thou! Strong heart and mighty brow, Thine eyes surcharged with love of all things fair; Facing with those grand eyes The light in the sweet skies. While thy shade earthward falls, darkening my soul to prayer. Sure as the great sun rolls, The crown of mighty souls Is martyrdom, and lo! thou hast thy crown. On her pale brow there weighed Another such proud shade— O, but we know you both, risen or stricken down. Sinful, mad, fever-fraught, At war with her own thought, Great-soul'd, sublime, the heir of constant pain, France hath the dreadful part To keep alive Man's heart, To shake the sleepy blood into the slug-gard's brain; Ever in act to spring, Ever in suffering, To point a lesson and to bear the load, Least happy and least free Of all the lands that be, Dying that all may live, first of the slaves of God. To try each crude desire By her own soul's fierce fire, To wait and watch with restless brain and heart, To quench the fierce thirst never, To feel supremely ever, To rush where cowards crawl—this is her awful part. Ever to cross and rack, Along the same red track, Genius is led, and speaks its soul out plain; Blessed are those that give— They die that man may live, Their crown is martyrdom, their privilege is pain. Spirit of the great brow! I see thee, know thee now— Last of the flock who die for man each day. Ah, but I should despair Did I not see up there A Shepherd heavenly-eyed on the heights far away. No cheat was thy vast scheme Tho' in thy gentle dream Thou saw'st no Shepherd watching the wild throng— Thou, walking the sad road Of all who seek for God, Blinded became at last, looking at Light so long. Yet God is multiform, Human of heart and warm, Content to take what shape the Soul loves best; Before our footsteps still, He changeth as we will— Only,—with blood alone we gain Him, and are blest. O, latest son of her, Freedom's pale harbinger, I see the Shepherd whom thou could'st not find; But on thy great fair brow, As thou didst pass but now, Bright burnt the patient Cross of those who bless mankind. And on her brow, who flies Bleeding beneath the skies, The mark was set that will not let her rest— Sinner in all men's sight, Mocker of very Light, Yet is she chosen thus, martyr'd—and shall be blest. Go by, O mighty dead! My soul is comforted; The Shepherd on the summit needs no prayers; Best worshipper is he Who suffers and is free— That Soul alone blasphemes which trembles and despairs. A DIRGE FOR KINGS. Strange are the bitter things God wreaks on cruel Kings; Sad is the cup drunk up By Kings accurst. In secret ways and strong God doth avenge man's wrong. The least, God saith, is Death, And Life the worst. Sit under the sweet skies; Think how Kings set and rise, Think, wouldst thou know the woe In each proud breast? Sit on the hearth and see Children look up to thee— Think, wouldst thou own a throne, Or lowly rest? Ah, to grow old, grow old, Upon a throne of gold— Ah, on a throne, so lone, To wear a crown; To watch the clouds, the air, Lest storm be breeding there— Pale, lest some blast may cast Thy glory down. He who with miser's ken Hides his red gold from men, And wakes and grieves, lest thieves Be creeping nigh; He who hath murder done, And fears each rising sun, Lest it say plain ‘O Cain, Rise up and die!’ These, and all underlings, Are blesseder than Kings, For ah! by weight of fate Kings' hearts are riven; With blood and gold they too Reckon their sad days thro'— They fear the plan of man, The wrath of heaven. In the great lonely bed, Hung round with gold and red, While the dim light each night Burns in the room, They lie alone and see The rustling tapestry, Lest Murther's eyes may rise Out of the gloom. Dost thou trust any man? Thou dost what no King can. Friend hast thou near and dear? A King hath none. Hast thou true love to kiss? A King hath no such bliss, On no true breast may rest Under the sun. Ah, to sit cold, sit cold, Upon a throne of gold, Forcing the while a smile To hide thy care; To taste no cup, to eat No food, however sweet, But with a drear dumb fear, Lest Death be there! Ah, to rule men, and know How many wish thee low— That 'neath the sun, scarce one Would keep thee high: To watch in agony The strife of all things free, To dread the mirth of Earth When thou shalt die! Hast thou a hard straw bed? Hast thou thy crust of bread? And hast thou quaffed thy draught Of water clear? And canst thou dance and sing?— O blesseder than a King! O happy one whom none Doth hate or fear! Wherefore, though from the strong Thou sufferest deep wrong, Tho' Kings, with ire and fire, Have wrought thee woe: Pray for them! for I swear Deeply they need thy prayer— Most in their hour of power, Least when cast low. And when thou castest down King, sceptre, throne, and crown, Pause that same day, and pray For the accurst; Since in strange ways and strong, God doth avenge man's wrong— The least, God saith, is Death, And Life the worst. THE PERFECT STATE. Where is the perfect State Early most blest and late, Perfect and bright? 'Tis where no Palace stands Trembling on shifting sands Morning and night. 'Tis where the soil is free, Where, far as eye may see, Scattered o'er hill and lea, Homesteads abound; Where clean and broad and sweet (Market, square, lane, and street, Belted by leagues of wheat), Cities are found. Where is the perfect State Early most blest and late, Gentle and good? 'Tis where no lives are seen Huddling in lanes unseen, Crying for food; 'Tis where the home is pure, 'Tis where the bread is sure, 'Tis where the wants are fewer, And each want fed; Where plenty and peace abide, Where health dwells heavenly-eyed, Where in nooks beautified, Slumber the Dead. Where is the perfect State Unvexed by Wrath and Hate, Quiet and just? Where to no form of creed Fetter'd are thought and deed, Reason and trust. 'Tis where the great free mart Broadens, while from its heart Forth the great ships depart, Blown by the wind; 'Tis where the wise men's eyes, Fixed on the earth and skies, Seeking for signs, devise Good for mankind. Where is the perfect State, Holy and consecrate, Blessedly wrought? 'Tis where all waft abroad Wisdom and faith in God, Beautiful thought. 'Tis where the Poet's sense Deepens in reverence, While to his truths intense Multitudes turn. Where the bright sons of art, Walking in street or mart, Feel mankind's reverent heart Tremble and yearn. Say, is the perfect State, Strong and self-adequate, There where it stands, Perfect in praise of God, Casting no thoughts abroad Over the lands? Nay: for by each man's side Hangeth a weapon tried; Nay: for wise leaders guide Under the Lord. Nor, when a people cries, Smiling with half-shut eyes, Waiteth this State,—but flies, Lifting the Sword. Where is the perfect State? Not where men sit and wait, Selfishly strong; While some lost sister State Crieth most desolate, Ruin'd by wrong; Not where men calmly sleep, Tho' all the world should weep Not where they merely heap Gold in the sun: Not where in charity Men with mere dust are free, When o'er the weary sea Murder is done. Which is the perfect State? Not the self-adequate Coward and cold; Not the brute thing of health, Swollen with gather'd wealth, Sleepy and old. Nay, but the mighty land Ever with helping hand, Ever with flaming brand, Rising in power: This is the fair and great, This the evangel State, Letting no wrong'd land wait In the dark hour. This is the perfect State, Early in arms and late; Blessed at home;— Ready at Freedom's cry Forward to fare and die, Over the foam. Loving States great and small, Loving home best of all, Yet at the holy call Springing abroad: This is the royal State, Perfect and adequate, Equal to any fate, Chosen of God! THE TWO VOICES. (January 1871.) FIRST VOICE. Fly to me, England! Hie to me, Now in mine hour of woe; Haste o'er the sea, ere I die, to me; Swiftly, my Sister! stand nigh to me. Help me to strike one blow! Over the land and the water, Swifter than winds can go, Up the red furrow of slaughter, Down on the lair of the foe! Now, when my children scream madly and cling to me; Now, when I droop o'er the dying they bring to me; Come to me, England! O speak to me, spring to me! Hurl the assassin low! SECOND VOICE. Woe to thee? I would go to thee Faster than wind can flee; Doth not my fond heart flow to thee? Would I might rise and show to thee All that my love would be! But behold, they bind me and blind me; Cowards, yet born of me; They fasten my hands behind me, I am chain'd to a rock in the sea. Alas, what availeth my grief while I sigh for thee? Traitors have trapt me—I struggle—I cry for thee— Come to thee, Sister? Yea, were it to die for thee!— O that my hands were free! FIRST VOICE. Pray for me, Sister! say for me Prayers until help is nigh; Send thy loud voice each way for me, Trouble the night and the day for me, Waken the world and the sky: Say that my heart is broken, Say that my children die; With blood and tears for thy token, Plead till the nations reply. Plead to the sea, and the earth, and the air for me! Move the hard heart of the world till it care for me— Come to me, England!—at least say a prayer for me, Waken the winds with a cry! SECOND VOICE. Doom on me, Hell's own gloom on me, Blood and a lasting blame! Already the dark days loom on me, Cold as the shade of the tomb on me; I am call'd by the coward's name. Shall I hark to a murder'd nation? Shall I sit unarm'd and tame? Then woe to this generation, Tho' out of my womb they came. Betrayed by my children, I wall and I call for thee; Not tears, but my heart's blood, O Sister, should fall for thee. My children are slaves, or would strike one and all for thee: Shame on them, shame! shame! shame! FIRST VOICE. Pain for thee! all things wane for thee In truth, if this be so, Fatal will be the stain for thee, Dying, I mourn and 'plain for thee, Since thou art left so low: For Death can come once only, Tho' bitterly comes the blow; But Shame abideth, and lonely Feels a sick heart come and go. Homeless and citiless, yet I can weep for thee; Fast comes the morrow with anguish most deep for thee; Dying, I mourn for the sorrow they heap for thee: Thine is the bitterest woe. SECOND VOICE. Mourn me not, Sister! scorn me not! Pray yet for mine and me; Tho' the old proud fame adorn me not, The sore grief hath outworn me not: Wait; I will come to thee. I will rend my chains asunder, I will tear my red sword free, I will come with mine ancient thunder, I will strike the foe to his knee. Yea! tho' the knife of the butcher is nigh to thee; Yea! while thou screamest and echoes reply to thee; Comfort, O France; for in God's name, I fly to thee— Sword in hand, over the sea! ODE BEFORE PARIS. (December 1870.) City of loveliness and light and splendour, City of Sorrows, hearken to our cry; O Mother tender, O Mother marvellously fair, And tairest now in thy despair, Look up! O be of comfort! Do not die! Let the black hour blow by. Cold is the night, and colder thou art lying. Gnawing a stone sits Famine at thy feet Shivering and sighing; Blacker than Famine, on thy breast, Like a sick child that will not rest, Moans Pestilence; and hard by, with fingers fleet, Frost weaves his winding-sheet. Snow, snow! the wold is white as one cold lily. Snow: it is frozen round thee as hard as lead; The wind blows chilly; Thou liest white in the dim night, And in thine eyes there is no light, And the Snow falleth, freezing on thy head, And covering up thy dead. Ah, woe! thy hands, no longer flower-bearing, Press stony on thy heart; and that heart bleeds; Thine eyes despairing Watch while the fierce Fire clings and crawls Through falling roofs and crumbling walls. Ah, woe! to see thee thus, the wild soul pleads, The wild tongue intercedes. O, we will cry to God, and pray and plead for thee; We, with a voice that troubles heaven and air, Will intercede for thee: We will cry for thee in thy pain, Louder than storm and wind and rain; What shape among the nations may compare With thee, most lost, most fair? Yea, thou hast sinned and fallen, O City splendid, Yea, thou hast passed through days of shamefullest woe— And lo! they are ended— Famine for famine, flame for flame, Sorrow for sorrow, shame for shame, Verily thou hast found them all;—and lo! Night and the falling snow. Let Famine eat thy heart, let Fire and Sorrow Hold thee, but turn thy patient eyes and see The dim sweet morrow. Better be thus than what thou wast, Better be stricken and overcast, Martyr'd once more, as when to all things free Thy lips cried ‘Liberty!’ Let the Snow fall! thou shalt be sweeter and whiter; Let the Fire burn! under the morning sky Thou shalt look brighter. Comfort thy sad soul through the night; Turn to the east and pray for light; Look up! O be of comfort! Do not die! Let the black hour blow by! A DIALOGUE IN THE SNOW. (Before Paris, December 1870.) DESERTER. O, I am spent! My heart fails, and my limbs Are palsied. Would to God I were dead! SISTERS OF MERCY. Stand! What art thou, who like a guilty thing Creepest along the shadow, stooping low? DESERTER. A man. Now stand aside, and let me pass. SISTERS. Not yet. Whence fleest thou? Whither dost thou go? DESERTER. From Famine and Fire. From Horror. From Frost and Death. SISTERS. O coward! traitor to unhappy France! Stand forward in the moon, that it may light The blush of shame uoon thy guilty cheek! Lo, we are women, yet we shiver cold To look upon so infamous a thing. DESERTER. Nay, look your fill, I care not—stand and see. SISTERS. O horror! horror! who hath done this deed? DESERTER. What say ye? am I fair to look upon? SISTERS. The dead are fairer. O unhappy one! DESERTER. Why do ye shudder? Am I then so foul? SISTERS. There is no living flesh upon thy bones. DESERTER. Famine hath fed upon my limbs too long. SISTERS. And thou art rent as by the teeth of hounds. DESERTER. Fire tore me, and what blood I have I bleed. SISTERS. Thine eyes stare like the blank eyes of a corpse. DESERTER. They have look'd so close on horror and so long, I cannot shut them from it till I die. SISTERS. Thou crawlest like a man whose sick limbs fail. DESERTER. Ha! Frost is there, and numbs me like a snake. SISTERS. God help thee, miserable one; and yet, Better if thou hadst perish'd in thy place Than live inglorious, tainted with thy shame. DESERTER. Shame? I am long past shame. I know her not. SISTERS. Is there no sense of honour in thy soul? DESERTER. Honour? Why see, she hath me fast enough: These are her other names, Fire, Famine, and Frost,— Soon I shall hear her last and sweetest,— Death. SISTERS. Hast thou no care for France, thy martyr'd land? DESERTER. What hath she given me? Curses and blows. SISTERS. O miserable one, remember God! DESERTER. God? Who hath look'd on God? Where doth He dwell? O fools, with what vain words and empty names Ye sicken me. Honour, France, God! All these— Hear me—I curse. Why, look you, there's the sky, Here the white earth, there, with its bleeding heart, The butcher'd City; here half dead stand I. A murder'd man, grown grey before my time, Forty years old—a husband, and a father— An outcast flying out of Hell. Who talks To me of ‘honour’? The first tears I wept When standing at my wretched mother's knee, Because her face was white, and she wore black. That day the bells rang out for victory. Then, look you, after that my mother sat Weeping and weary in an empty house, And they who look'd upon her shrunken cheeks Fed her with ‘honour.’ 'Twas too gentle fare,— She died. Nay, hearken! Left to seek for bread, I like a wild thing haunted human doors Searching the ash for food. I ate and lived. I grew. Then, wretched as I was, I felt Strange stirs of manhood in my flesh and bones, Dim yearnings, fierce desires, and one pale face Could still them as the white moon charms the sea. Oh, but I was a low and unclean thing, And yet she loved me, and I stretch'd these hands To God, and blest Him for His charity. Mark that:—I blest Him, I. Even as I stood, Bright in new manhood, the drums beat,— a hand Fell on my shoulder, and, ‘in France's name,’ A voice cried, ‘Follow.’ To my heart they held Cold steel:—I followed; following saw her face Fade to a bitter cry—hurl'd on with blows, Curs'd, jeer'd at, scorn'd, went forth as in a dream, And, driven into the bloody flash of war, Struck like a blinded beast I knew not whom Blows for I knew not what. The fierce years came Like ulcers on my heart, and heal'd, and went. Then I crept back, a broken sickly man, To seek her, and I found her—dead! She had died, Poor worm, of hunger. She had ask'd for bread, And ‘France’ had given her stones. She had pray'd to ‘God’; He had given her a grave. The day she died, The bells rang for another victory. SISTERS. O do not weep! Yet we are weeping too. DESERTER. Now mark, I was too poor a worm to grieve Too long and deeply. The years passed. My heart Heal'd, and as wounds heal, harden'd. Once again I join'd the wolves that up and down the earth Rush tearing at men's lives and women's hearts. That passed, and I was free. One morn I saw Another woman, and I hunger'd to her, And we were wedded. Hard days follow'd that; And children—she was fruitful—all your worms Are fruitful, mark—that is God's blessing too! Well, but we throve, and farm'd a bit of land Out yonder by the City. I learn'd to love The mother of my little ones. Time sped; And then I heard a cry across the fields, The old cry, ‘Honour,’ the old cry, ‘For France!’ And like a wolf caught in his lair I shrunk And shudder'd. It grew louder, that curst cry! Day follow'd day, no bells rung victory, But there were funeral faces everywhere; And then I heard the far feet of the foe Trampling the field of France and coming nearer To that poor field I sow'd. I would have fled, But that they thrust a weapon in mine hands And bade me stand and strike ‘for France.’ I laugh'd! But the wolves had me, and we screaming drew Into the City. Shall I gorge your souls With horror? Shall I croak into your ears What I have suffer'd there, what I have seen? I was a worm, ever a worm, and starved While the plump coward cramm'd. Look at me, women, Fire, Famine, and Frost have got me; yet I crawl, And shall crawl on; for hark you, yester-night, Standing within the City, sick at heart, I gazed up eastward, thinking of my home And of the woman and children desolate, And lo! out of the darkness where I knew Our hamlet lay there shot up flames and cast A bloody light along the arc of heaven; And all my heart was sicken'd unaware With hunger such as any wild thing feels To crawl again in secret to the place Whence the fierce hunter drove it, and to see If its young live; and thither indeed I fare; And yonder flame still flareth, and I crawl, And I shall crawl unto it though I die; And I shall only smile if they be dead, If I may merely see them once again,— For come what may, my cup of life is full, And I am broken from all use and will. SISTERS. Pass on, unhappy one; God help thee now! DESERTER. If ye have any pity, give me bread. SISTERS. Lean on us! Oh thou lost one, come this way. THE PRAYER IN THE NIGHT. Stars in heaven with gentle faces, Can ye see and keep your places? Flowers that on the old earth blossom, Can ye hang on such a bosom? Canst thou wander on for ever Through a world so sad, O River? O ye fair things 'neath the sun, Can ye bear what Man hath done? This is Earth. Heaven glimmers yonder. Pause a little space and ponder! Day by day the fair world turneth Dewy eyes to heaven and yearneth, Day by day the mighty Mother Sees her children smite each other. She moans, she pleads, they do not hear her— She prays-the skies seem gathering near her— Yearning down diviner, bluer, Baring every star unto her,— Each strange light with swinging censer Sweeter seeming and intenser,— Yet she ceaseth not her cry, Seeing how her children die. On her bosom they are lying, Clinging to her, dead and dying— Dead eyes frozen in imploring Yonder heaven they died adoring, Dying eyes that upward glimmer Ever growing darker, dimmer; And her eyes, too, thither turning, Asking, praying, weeping, yearning, Search the blue abysses, whither He who made her, brought her hither, Gave her children, bade them grow, Vanished from her long ago. Ah, what children! Father, see them! Never word of hers may free them— Never word of love may win them. For there burneth fierce within them Fire of thine; soul-sick and sinning, As they were in the beginning, Here they wander. Father, see! Generations born of Thee! Blest was Earth when on her bosom First she saw the double blossom, Double sweetness, man and woman, One in twain, divine and human, Leaping, laughing, crying, clinging, To the sound of her sweet singing— Flesh like lily and rose together, Eyes as blue as April weather, Golden hair with golden shadows, In the face the light of meadows, In the eyes the dim soul peeping Like the sky in water sleeping. ‘Guard them well!’ the Father said, Set them in her arms,—and fled. Countless worlds around Him yearning, Vanish'd He from her discerning;— Then she drooped her fair face, seeing On her breast each gentle being: And unto her heart she prest them, Raised her look to heaven and blest them; And the fountains leapt around her, Leaves and flowers shot up and crown'd her, Flowers bloom'd and streams ran gleaming. Till with bliss she sank to dreaming;— And the darkness for a cover Gently drew its veil above her, And the new-born smiled reposing, And a million eyes unclosing Yearn'd through all the veil to see That new fruit of mystery. Father! come from the abysses; Come, Thou light the Mother misses; Come; while hungry generations Pass away, she sits in patience. Of the children Thou didst leave her, Millions have been born to grieve her. See! they gather, living, dying, Coming, going, multiplying; And the Mother, for the Father, Though like waves they rise and gather, Though they blossom thick as grasses, Misses every one that passes, Flashes on them peace and light Of a love grown infinite. Father! see them: hath each creature Something in him of Thy nature? Born of Thee and of no other, Born to Thee by a sweet Mother, Man strikes man, and brother brother. Hearts of men from Thy heart fashioned Bleed and anguish bloody-passion'd; Beast-like roar the generations; Tiger-nations spring on nations; Though the stars yearn downward nightly, Though the days come ever brightly, Though to gentle holy couches Death in angel's guise approaches, Though they name Thee, though they woo Thee, Though they dream of, yearn unto Thee, Ill they guess the guise Thou bearest, Ill they picture Thee, Thou Fairest;— Come again, O Father wise, Awe them with those loving eyes! Stars in heaven with tender faces, Can ye see and keep your places? Flowers that on the Earth will blossom, Can ye deck so sad a bosom? Canst thou singing flow for ever Through a world so dark, O River? Father, canst Thou calmly scan All that Man hath made of Man? THE SPIRIT OF FRANCE. Who passeth there Naked and bare, A bloody sword upraising? Who with thin moan Glides past alone, At the black heaven gazing? Limbs thin and stark, Eyes sunken and dark, The lightning round her leaping? What shape floats past Upon the blast, Crouching in pain and creeping? Behold! her eyes to heaven are cast, And they are red with weeping. Say a prayer thrice With lips of ice: 'Tis she—yea, and no other; Look not at me So piteously, O France—O martyr mother! O whither now, With branded brow And bleeding heart, art flying? Whither away? O stand! O stay! Tho' winds, waves, clouds are crying— Dawn cometh swift—'twill soon be day— The Storm of God is dying. She will not speak, But, spent and weak, Droops her proud head and goeth; See! she crawls past, Upon the blast, Whither no mortal knoweth— O'er fields of fight, Where glimmer white Death's steed and its gaunt rider— Thro' storm and snow Behold her go, With never a friend beside her— O Shepherd of all winds that blow, To Quiet Waters guide her! There, for a space, Let her sad face Fall in a tranquil mirror— There spirit-sore May she count o'er Her sin, her shame, her error,— And read with eyes Made sweet and wise What her strong God hath taught her, With face grown fair And bosom bare And hands made clean from slaughter— O Shepherd, seek and find her there, Beside some Quiet Water! THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE SWORD. (Versailles, 1871.) PRIEST. Hark to the Song of the Sword! In the beginning, a Word Came from the lips of the Lord; And He said, ‘The Earth shall be, And around the Earth and Sea, And over these twain the Skies; And out of the Earth shall rise Man, the last and the first; And Man shall hunger and thirst, And shall eat of the fruits in the sun, And drink of the streamlets that run, And shall find the wild yellow grains, And, opening earth, in its veins Sow the seeds of the same; for of bread I have written that he shall be fed.’ Thus at the first said the Lord. CHOIR. Hark to the Song of the Sword! PRIEST. Then Man sowed the grain, and to bread Kneaded the grain, and was fed, He and his household indeed To the last generation and seed: Then the children of men, young and old, Sat by the waters of gold, And ate of the bread and the fruit, And drank of the stream, but made suit For blessing no more than the brute. And God said, ‘'Twere better to die Than eat and drink merely, and lie Beast-like and foul on the sod, Lusting, forgetful of God!’ And he whispered, ‘Dig deeper again, Under the region of grain, And bring forth the thing ye find there Shapeless and dark; and prepare Fire,—and into the same Cast what ye find—let it flame— And when it is burning blood-bright, Pluck it forth, and with hammers of might Beat it out, beat it out, till ye mark The thing that was shapeless and dark Grown beautiful, azure, and keen, Purged in the fire and made clean. Beautiful, holy, and bright, Gleaming aloft in the light;— Then lift it, and wield!’ said the Lord. CHOIR. Hark to the Song of the Sword! PRIEST. Then Man with a brighter desire Saw the beautiful thing from the fire, And the slothful arose, and the mean Trembled to see it so keen, And God, as they gather'd and cried, Thunder'd a World far and wide: ‘This Sword is the Sword of the Strong! It shall strike at the life's blood of wrong; It shall kill the unclean, it shall wreak My doom on the shameful and weak; And the strong with this sign in their hands Shall gather their hosts in the lands, And strike at the mean and the base, And strengthen from race on to race; And the weak shall be wither'd at length, For the glory of Man is his strength, And the weak man must die,’ saith the Lord. CHOIR. Hark to the Song of the Sword! PRIEST. Sire, whom all men of thy race Name as their hope and their grace; King of the Rhine-water'd land. Heart of the state and its hand, Thou of the purple and crown, Take, while thy servants bow down, The Sword in thy grasp. KAISER. It is done. PRIEST. Uplift! let it gleam in the sun— Uplift in the name of the Lord! CHOIR. Hail to the King and the Sword! KAISER. Lo! how it gleams in the light, Beautiful, bloody, and bright— Such in the dark days of yore The monarchs of Israel bore; Such by the angels of heaven To Charles the Mighty was given— Yea, I uplift the Sword, Thus in the name of the Lord! THE CHIEFS. Form ye a circle of fire Around him, our King and our Sire— While in the centre he stands, Kneel with your swords in your hands, Then with one voice deep and free Echo like waves of the sea— ‘In the name of the Lord!’ CHANCELLOR. Sire, while thou liftest the Sword, Thus in the name of the Lord, I too, thy slave, kneel and blend My voice with the hosts that attend— Yea, and while kneeling I hold A scroll writ in letters of gold, With the names of the monarchs who bow Thy liegemen throned lower than thou; Moreover, in letters of red, Their names who ere long must be led To thy feet, while thou liftest the Sword, Thus in the name of the Lord. VOICES WITHOUT. Where is he?—he fades from our sight! Where the Sword?—all is blacker than night. Is it finish'd, that loudly ye cry? Doth he sheathe the great Sword while we die? O bury us deep, most deep; Write o'er us, wherever we sleep, ‘In the name of the Lord!’ KAISER. While I uplift the Sword, Thus in the name of the Lord, Why, with mine eyes full of tears, Am I sick of the song in mine ears? God of the Israelite, hear; God of the Teuton, be near; Strengthen my pulse lest I fail, Shut out these slain while they wail— For they come with the voice of the grave On the glory they give me and gave. CHORUS. In the name of the Lord? Of what Lord? Where is He, this God of the Sword? Unfold Him; where hath He his throne? Is he Lord of the Teuton alone? Doth He walk on the earth? Doth He tread On the limbs of the dying and dead? Unfold Him! We sicken, and long To look on this God of the strong! PRIEST. Hush! In the name of the Lord, Kneel ye, and bless ye the Sword! Bless it with soul and with brain, Bless it for saved and for slain, For the sake of the dead in the tomb, For the sake of the child in the womb, For the sake of these Kings on the knee, For the sake of a world it shall free! Bless it, the Sword! bless the Sword! Yea, in the name of the Lord! CHIEFS. Deepen the circle of Fire Around him, our King and our Sire! While in our centre he towers, Kneeling, ye spirits, ye powers, Bless it and bless it again, Bless it for saved and for slain, Bless ye the beautiful Sword, Aloud in the name of the Lord! KAISER. In the name of the Lord! ALL. In the name of the Lord! THE CHAUNT BY THE RHINE. (1871.) Te verò appello sanctissimum Flumen, tibique futura prædico: torrenti sanguine plenus ad ripas usque erumpes, undæque divinæ non solum polluentur sanguine, sed totæ rumpentur, et viris multo major erit numerus sepultorum. Quid fles, O Asclepi?—The Asclepian Dialogue. FIRST VOICE. (From Germany.) Flash the sword!—and even as thunder Utter ye one living voice,— While the watching nations wonder, Hills of Fatherland, rejoice: Echo!—echo back our prayers and acclamations! SECOND VOICE. (From France.) France, O Mother! lie and hearken, Make no bitterer sign of woe, Here within thee all things darken, All things brighten with thy foe: Hush thy weeping; still thy bitter lamentations. FIRST VOICE. Flash the sword!—A voice is flowing From the Baltic bound in white, Though 'tis blowing chill and snowing, Blue-eyed Teutons see the light. And the far white hills of Norway hear the crying. SECOND VOICE. Thou too hearkenest, Mother dearest, Thou too hearkenest through thy tears, And thou tremblest as thou hearest, For 'tis thunder in thine ears; And thou gazest on the dead and on the dying. FIRST VOICE. Lübeck answers and rejoices, Though her dead are brought to her; Potsdam thunders; there are voices In the fields of Hanover; And the spirits of the lonely Hartz awaken. SECOND VOICE. And in France's vales and mountains Hands are wrung and tears are shed; Women sit by village fountains, And the water bubbles red. O comfort, O be of comfort—ye forsaken! FIRST VOICE. O'er Bavarian woods and rivers, Where the Brunswick heather waves, On the glory goes and quivers Through the Erzgebirge caves; And the swords of Styria gleam like moonlit water. SECOND VOICE. There is silence, there is weeping, On the bloody banks of Seine, And the unburied dead are sleeping In the fields of trampled grain; While the roadside Christs stare down on fields of slaughter. FIRST VOICE. Flash the sword! Where need is sorest, Sitting in the lonely night, While the wind in the Black Forest Moans, the woodman sees the light; And the hunters wind the horn and hail each other. SECOND VOICE. Strasbourg sits among her ashes With a last despairing cry; East and west red ruin flashes With a red light on the sky. Not a word! Sit yet and hearken, O my Mother! FIRST VOICE. Flash the sword! The glades of Baden Echo; Jena laughs anon; Dresden old and Stuttgart gladden, There is mirth in Ratisbon:— And underneath the Linden there is leaping. SECOND VOICE. In thine arms the horror tarries, And the sword-flash gleams on thee, Hide thy funeral face, O Paris, Do not hearken; do not see; Flectra, clasp thine urn, and hush thy weeping. FIRST VOICE. Hamburg kindles, and her women Sadly smile remembering all; There are bitter smiles in Bremen, Where Vandamme's fierce feet did fall; But the Katzbach, O the Katzbach laugheth loudly! SECOND VOICE. Comfort, Mother! hear not, heed not; Let the dead bury the dead! Fold thy powerless hands and plead not, They remember sorrows fled, And their dead go by them, silently and proudly. FIRST VOICE. O that Fritz's soul could hear it In the walks of Sans Souci! O to waken Lützow's spirit, Blücher's too, the grim and free; And the Jäger, the wild Jäger, would they listen'd! SECOND VOICE. Comfort, Mother! O cease weeping! Let the past bury the past: Faces of the slain and sleeping Gleam along upon the blast. Yea, 'twas ‘Leipsic’ that they murmur'd as they glisten'd. FIRST VOICE. All the land of the great River Slowly brightens near and far; Lost for once, and saved for ever, Körner's spirit like a star Shooteth past, and all remember the beginning. SECOND VOICE. They are rising, they are winging, Spirits of her singers dead: 'Tis an old song they are singing, Fold thy hands and bow thy head, But they sing for thee too, gentle to thy sinning. FIRST VOICE. And the River to the ocean Rolls; and all its castles dim Gleam; and with a shadowy motion, Like a mist upon its brim, Rise the Dead,—and look this way with shining faces. SECOND VOICE. Thine, too, rise!—and darkly cluster, Moaning sad around thee now, In their eyes there is no lustre, They are cold as thy cold brow— Let them vanish; let them sleep in their dark places. FIRST VOICE. Flash the sword! In the fair valleys Where the scented Neckar flows, Fair-hair'd Teutons lift the chalice, And the winter vineyard grows, And the almond forests tremble into blossom. SECOND VOICE. On thy vineyards the cold daylight Gleams, and they are deadly chill; Women wander in the grey light, And the lean trees whistle shrill; Hold thine urn, O martyr Mother, to thy bosom. FIRST VOICE. Flash the sword! Sweet notes of pleasure O'er the Rhenish upland swell, And the overhanging azure Sees itself in the Moselle. All the land of the great River gleams and hearkens! SECOND VOICE. Dost thou hear them? dost thou see them? There 'tis gladness, here 'tis pain; One great Spirit comes to free them, But he holds thee with a chain. All the land of the great City weeps and darkens! FIRST VOICE. River of the mighty people, Broaden to the sea and flow, Mirror tilth and farm and steeple, Darken with boats that come and go. Smile gently, like a babe that smiles and prattles. SECOND VOICE. Yea! and though thou flow for ever, Bright and bloodless as to-day, Scarcely wilt thou wash, O River, Thy dark load of dead away, O bloody River! O field of many battles! FIRST VOICE. On with great immortal waters Brightening to a day divine, Through the fields of many slaughters Freely roll, O German Rhine. Let the Teuton drink thy wine and wax the stronger. SECOND VOICE. On and on, O mighty River, Flow through lands of corn and vine— Turn away, O France, for ever, Look no more upon the Rhine; On the River of many sorrows look no longer. FIRST VOICE. Lo! the white Alps for a token With the wild aurora gleam, And the Spectre of the Brocken Stands aloft with locks that stream,— All the land of the great River can behold it! SECOND VOICE. Hide thine eyes and look not thither! For, in answer to their cries, Fierce the Phantasm gazeth hither With an Avenging Angel's eyes; It is fading, and the mists of storm enfold it! Saint Abe and his Seven Wives. A TALE OF SALT LAKE CITY. DEDICATION: TO OLD DAN CHAUCER. Maypole dance and Whitsun ale, Sports of peasants in the dale, Harvest mirth and junketting, Fireside play and kiss-in-ring, Ancient fun and wit and ease,— Gone are one and all of these; All the pleasant pastime planned In the green old Mother-land: Gone are these and gone the time Of the breezy English rhyme, Sung to make men glad and wise By great Bards with twinkling eyes: Gone the tale and gone the song Sound as nut-brown ale and strong, Freshening the sultry sense Out of idle impotence, Sowing features dull or bright With deep dimples of delight! Thro' the Mother-land I went, Seeking these, half indolent: Up and down, I saw them not; Only found them, half-forgot, Buried in long-darken'd nooks With thy barrels of old books, Where the light and love and mirth Of the morning days of earth Sleeps, like light of sunken suns Brooding deep in cob-webb'd tuns! Everywhere I found instead, Hanging her dejected head, Barbing shafts of bitter wit, The pale Modern Spirit sit— While her shadow, great as Gog's, Cast upon the island fogs, In the midst of all things dim Loom'd, gigantically grim. Honest Chaucer, thee I greet In a verse with blithesome feet, And, tho' modern bards may stare, Crack a passing joke with Care! Take a merry song and true Fraught with inner meanings too! Goodman Dull may croak and scowl:— Leave him hooting to the owl! Tight-laced Prudery may turn Angry back with eyes that burn, Reading on from page to page Scrofulous novels of the age! Fools may frown and humbugs rail, Not for them I tell the Tale; Not for them, but souls like thee, Wise old English Jollity! Newport, October, 1871. APPROACHING UTAH.—THE BOSS'S TALE. I. Passing the Ranche. ‘Grrr!” shrieked the boss, with teeth clench'd tight, Just as the lone ranche hove in sight, And with a face of ghastly hue He flogg'd the horses till they flew, As if the devil were at their back, Along the wild and stony track. From side to side the waggon swung, While to the quaking seat I clung. Dogs bark'd; on each side of the pass The cattle grazing on the grass Raised heads and stared; and with a cry Out the men rush'd as we roll'd by. ‘Grrr!’ shriek'd the boss; and o'er and o'er He flogg'd the foaming steeds and swore; Harder and harder grew his face As by the ranche we swept apace, And faced the hill, and past the pond, And gallop'd up the height beyond, Nor tighten'd rein till field and farm Were hidden by the mountain's arm A mile behind; when, hot and spent, The horses paused on the ascent, And mopping from his brow the sweat, The boy glanced round with teeth still set, And panting, with his eyes on me, Smil'd with a look of savage glee. Joe Wilson is the boss's name, A Western boy well known to fame. He goes about the dangerous land His life for ever in his hand; Has lost three fingers in a fray, Has scalp'd his Indian too they say; Between the white man and the red Four times he hath been left for dead; Can drink, and swear, and laugh, and brawl, And keeps his big heart thro' it all Tender for babes and women. He Turned, smiled, and nodded savagely; Then, with a dark look in his eyes In answer to my dumb surprise, Pointed with jerk of the whip's heft Back to the place that we had left, And cried aloud, ‘I guess you think I'm mad, or vicious, or in drink. but theer you're wrong. I never pass The ranche down theer and bit of grass, I never pass 'em, night nor day, But the fit takes me just that way! The hosses know as well as me What's coming, miles afore we see The dern'd old corner of a place, And they git ready for the race! Lord! if I didn't lash and sweer, And ease my rage out passing theer, Guess I should go clean mad, that's all. And thet's the reason why I call This turn of road where I am took Jest Old Nick's Gallop!’ Then his look Grew more subdued yet darker still; And as the horses up the hill With loosen'd rein toil'd slowly, he Went on in half soliloquy, Indifferent almost if I heard, And grimly grinding out each word. II. Joe Wilson goes a-Courting. ‘There was a time, and no mistake, When thet same ranche down in the brake Was pleasanter a heap to me Than any sight on land or sea. The hosses knew it like their master, Smelt it miles orf, and spank'd the faster! Ay, bent to reach thet very spot, Flew till they halted steaming hot Sharp opposite the door, among The chicks and children old and young; And down I'd jump, and all the go Was ‘Fortune, boss!’ and ‘Welcome, Joe!’ And Cissy with her shining face, Tho' she was missus of the place, Stood larfing, hands upon her hips; And when upon her rosy lips I put my mouth and gave her one, She'd cuff me, and enjy the fun! She was a widow young and tight, Her chap had died in a free fight, And here she lived, and round her had Two chicks, three brothers, and her dad, All making money fast as hay, And doing better every day. Waal! guess tho' I was peart and swift, Spooning was never much my gift; But Cissy was a gal so sweet, So fresh, so spicy, and so neat, It put your wits all out o' place, Only to star' into her face. Skin whiter than a new-laid egg, Lips full of juice, and sech a leg! A smell about her, morn and e'en, Like fresh-bleach'd linen on a green; And from her hand when she took mine, The warmth ran up like sherry wine; And if in liquor I made free To pull her larfing on my knee, Why, there she'd sit, and feel so nice, Her heer all scent, her breath all spice! See! women hate, both young and old, A chap that's over shy and cold, And fire of all sorts kitches quick, And Cissy seem'd to feel full slick The same fond feelings, and at last Grew kinder every time I passed; And all her face, from eyes to chin, Said ‘Bravo, Joe! You're safe to win!’ And tho' we didn't fix, d'ye see, In downright words that it should be, Ciss and her fam'ly understood That she and me would jine for good. Guess I was like a thirsty boss Dead beat for days, who comes across A fresh clear beck, and on the brink Scoops out his shaky hand to drink; Or like a gal or boy of three, With eyes upon a pippin-tree; Or like some Injin cuss who sees A bottle of rum among the trees, And by the bit of smouldering log, Where squatters camp'd and took their grog The night afore. Waal!’ (here he ground His teeth again with savage sound) ‘Waal, stranger, fancy, jest for fun, The feelings of the thirsty one, If, jest as he scoop'd out his hand, The water turn'd to dust and sand! Or fancy how the lad would scream To see thet fruit-tree jest a dream! Or guess how thet poor Injin cuss, Would dance and swear, and screech and fuss, If when he'd drawn the cork and tried To get a gulp of rum inside, 'Twarn't anything in thet theer style, But physic stuff or stinking ile! Ah! you've a notion now, I guess, Of how all ended in a mess, And how when I was putting in My biggest card and thought to win, The Old One taught her how to cheat, And yer I found myself, clean beat!’ III. Saint and Disciple. Joe Wilson paused, and gazed straight down. With gritting teeth and bitter frown, And not till I entreated him Did he continue,—fierce and grim, With knitted brow and teeth clench'd tight. ‘Along this way one summer night, Jest as I meant to take the prize, Passed an Apostle—dern his eyes!— On his old pony, gravel-eyed, His legs a-dangling down each side, With twinkling eyes and wheedling smile, Grinning beneath his broad-brimm'd tile, With heer all scent and shaven face, He came a-trotting to the place. My luck was bad, I wasn't near, But busy many a mile from yer; And what I tell was told to me By them as were at hand to see. 'Twarn't every day, I reckon, they Saw an Apostle pass their way! And Cissy, being kind o' soft, And empty in the upper loft, Was full of downright joy and pride To hev thet saint at her fireside— One of the seventy they call The holiest holy—dern 'em all! O he was 'cute and no mistake, Deep as Salt Lake, and wide awake! Theer at the ranche three days he stayed, And well he knew his lying trade. 'Twarn't long afore he heard full free About her larks and thet with me, And how 'twas quite the fam'ly plan To hev me for her second man. At fust thet old Apostle said Little, but only shook his head; But you may bet he'd no intent To let things go as things had went. Three nights he stayed, and every night He squeezed her hand a bit more tight; And every night he didn't miss To give a loving kiss to Ciss; And tho' his fust was on her brow, He ended with her mouth, somehow. O, but he was a knowing one, The Apostle Hiram Higginson! Grey as a badger's was his heer, His age was over sixty year (Her grandfather was little older), So short, his head just touch'd her shoulder; His face all grease, his voice all puff, His eyes two currants stuck in duff:— Call thet a man!—then look at me! Thretty year old and six foot three, Afear'd o' nothing morn nor night, The man don't walk I wouldn't fight! Women is women! Thet's their style— Talk reason to them and they'll bile; But baste 'em soft as any pigeon, With lies and rubbish and religion; Don't talk of flesh and blood and feeling, But Holy Ghost and blessed healing; Don't name things in too plain a way, Look a heap warmer than you say, Make 'em believe they're serving true The Holy Spirit and not you, Prove all the world but you's damnation, And call your kisses jest salvation; Do this, and press 'em on the sly, You're safe to win 'em. Jest you try! ‘Fust thing I heerd of all this game, One night when to the ranche I came, Jump'd down, ran in, saw Cissy theer, And thought her kind o' cool and queer; For when I caught her with a kiss, 'Twarn't that she took the thing amiss, But kept stone cool and gev a sigh, And wiped her mouth upon the sly On her white milkin’-apron. “Waal,” Says I, “you're out o' sorts, my gel!” And with a squeamish smile for me, Like folks hev when they're sick at sea, Says she, “O, Joseph, ere too late, I am awaken'd to my state— How pleasant and how sweet it is To be in sech a state of bliss!” I stared and gaped, and turned to Jim Her brother, and cried out to him, “Hullo, mate, what's the matter here? What's come to Cissy? Is she queer?” Jim gev a grin and answered, “Yes, A trifle out o' sorts, I guess.” But Cissy here spoke up and said, “It ain't my stomach, nor my head, It ain't my flesh, it ain't my skin, It's holy spirits here within!” “Waal,” says I, meanin' to be kind, “I must be off, for I'm behind; But next time that I pass this way We'll fix ourselves without delay. I know what your complaint is, Ciss, I've seen the same in many a miss, Keep up your spirits, thet's your plan, You're lonely here without a man, And you shall hev as good a one As e'er druv hoss beneath the sun!” At that I buss'd her with a smack, Turn'd out, jump'd up, and took the track, And larfing druv along the pass. ‘Theer! Guess I was as green as grass!’ IV. The Book of Mormon. ‘'Twas jest a week after thet day When down I druv again this way. My heart was light; and 'neath the box I'd got a shawl and two fine frocks For Cissy. On in spanking style The hosses went mile arter mile; The sun was blazing golden bright, The sunflowers burning in the light, The cattle in the golden gleer Wading for coolness everywheer Among the shinin' ponds, with flies As thick as pepper round their eyes And on their heads. See! as I went Whistling like mad and waal content, Altho' 'twas broad bright day all round, A cock crow'd, and I thought the sound Seem'd pleasant. Twice or thrice he crow'd, And then up to the ranche I rode. Since then I've often heerd folk say When a cock crows in open day It's a bad sign, announcin' clear Black luck or death to those thet hear. ‘When I drew up, all things were still. I saw the boys far up the hill Tos in’ the hay; but at the door No Cissy stood as oft afore. No, not a soul there, left nor right, Her very chicks were out o' sight. So down I jump'd, and “Ciss!” I cried, But not a sign of her outside. With thet into the house I ran, But found no sight of gel or man— All empty. Thinks I, “This is queer!”— Look'd in the dairy—no one theer; Then loiter'd round the kitchen track Into the orchard at the back: Under the fruit-trees' shade I pass'd, . . . Thro' the green bushes, . . . and at last Found, as the furthest path I trode, The gel I wanted. Ye . . . s! by—! ‘The gel I wanted—ay, I found More than I wanted, you'll be bound! Theer, seated on a wooden cheer, With bows and ribbons in her heer, Her hat a-swinging on a twig Close by, sat Ciss in her best rig, And at her feet that knowing one, The Apostle Hiram Higginson! They were too keen to notice me, So I held back behind a tree And watch'd 'em. Never night nor day Did I see Cissy look so gay, Her eyes all sparkling blue and bright, Her face all sanctified delight. She hed her gown tuck'd up to show Embrider'd petticoat below, And jest a glimpse, below the white, Of dainty leg in stocking tight With crimson clocks; and on her knee She held an open book, which he, Thet dern'd Apostle at her feet, With her low milking-stool for seat Was reading out all clear and pat Keeping the place with finger fat; Creeping more close to book and letter To feel the warmth of his text better His crimson face like a cock's head With his emotion as he read, And now and then his eyes he'd close Jest like a cock does when he crows Above the heads of thet strange two The shade was deep, the sky was blue, The place was full of warmth and smell, All round the fruit and fruit-leaves fell, And that Saint's voice, when all was still, Was like the groanin' of a mill. ‘At last he stops for lack of wind, And smiled with sarcy double-chinn'd Fat face at Cissy, while she cried, Rocking herself from side to side, “O Bishop, them are words of bliss!” And then he gev a long fat kiss On her warm hand, and edged his stool Still closer. Could a man keep cool And see it? Trembling thro' and thro’ I walked right up to thet theer two, And caught the dern'd old lump of duff Jest by the breeches and the scruff, And chuck'd him off, and with one kick Sent his stool arter him right slick— While Cissy scream'd with frighten'd face, “Spare him! O spare that man of grace!” ‘“Spare him!” I cried, and gev a shout, “What's this yer shine you air about— What cuss is this that I jest see With that big book upon your knee, Cuddling up close and making sham To read a heap of holy flam?” Then Cissy clasp'd her hands, and said, While that dern'd Saint sat fierce and red, Mopping his brow with a black frown, And squatting where I chuck'd him down, “Joe Wilson, stay your hand so bold, Come not a wolf into the fold; Forbear to touch that holy one— The Apostle Hiram Higginson.” “Touch him!” said I; “for half a pin I'd flay and quarter him and skin! Waal may he look so white and skeer'd, For of his doings I have heerd; Five wives he hev already done, And him—not half the man for one!” ‘And then I stoop'd and took a peep At what they'd studied at so deep, And read, for I can read a bit, “The Book of Mormon”—what was writ By the first Saint of all the lot, Mad Joseph, him the Yankees shot. “What's the contents of this yer book?” Says I, and fixed her with a look. “O Joe,” she answered, “read aright, It is a book of blessed light— Thet holy man expounds it clear; Edification great is theer!” Then, for my blood was up, I took One kick at thet infernal book, And tho' the Apostle guv a cry, Into the well I made it fly, And turning to the Apostle cried, “Tho' thet theer Scriptur' is your guide, You'd best depart without delay, Afore you sink in the same way! And sure as fate you'll wet your skin If you come courting yer agin!” ‘At first he stared and puff'd and blew,— “Git out!” I cried, and off he flew, And not till he was out o' reach Shook his fat fist and found his speech. I turned to Cissy. “Cicely Dunn,” Ses I, “is this a bit of fun Or eernest?” Reckon 'twas a sight To see the way she stood upright, Rolled her blue eyes up, tried to speak, Made fust a giggle, then a squeak, And said half crying, “I despise Your wicked calumnies and lies, And what you would insinuate Won't move me from my blessed state. Now I perceive in time, thank hiven, You are a man to anger given, Jealous and vi'lent. Go away! And when you recollect this day, And those bad words you've said to me, Blush if you kin. Tehee! tehee!” And then she sobbed, and in her cheer Fell crying: so I felt quite queer, And stood like a dern'd fool, and star'd Watchin' the pump a-going hard; And then at last, I couldn't stand The sight no more, but slipt my hand Sharp into hers, and said quite kind, “Say no more, Cissy—never mind; I know how queer you women's ways is— Let the Apostle go to blazes!” Now thet was plain and fair. With this I would have put my arm round Ciss. But Lord! you should have seen her face, When I attempted to embrace; Sprang to her feet and gev a cry, Her back up like a cat's, her eye All blazing, and cried fierce and clear, “You villain, touch me if you deer!” And jest then in the distance, fur From danger, a voice echoed her,— The dern'd Apostle's, from some place Where he had hid his ugly face,— Crying out faint and thick and clear, “Yes, villain, touch her if you deer!” ‘So riled I was, to be so beat, I could have struck her to my feet. I didn't tho', tho’ sore beset— I never struck a woman yet. ‘But off I walked right up the pass, And found the men among the grass, And when I came in sight said flat, “What's this yer game Cissy is at? She's thrown me off, and taken pity On an Apostle from the City. Five wives already, too, has he— Poor cussed things as e'er I see— Does she mean mischief or a lark?” Waal, all the men at thet look'd dark, And scratch'd their heads and seem'd in doubt. At last her brother Jim spoke out— “Joe, don't blame us—by George, it's true, We're chawed by this as much as you; We've done our best and tried and tried, But Ciss is off her head with pride. And all her thoughts, both night and day, Are with the Apostles fur away. ‘O that I were in bliss with them Theer in the new Jerusalem!’ She says; and when we laugh and sneer, Ses we're jest raging wolves down here. She's a bit dull at home d'ye see, Allays liked heaps of company, And now the foolish critter paints A life of larks among the Saints. We've done our best, don't hev a doubt, To keep the old Apostle out: We've trained the dogs to seize and bite him, We've got up ghosts at night to fright him, Doctor'd his hoss and so upset him, Put tickle-grass in bed to fret him, Jalap'd his beer and snuffed his tea too, Gunpowder in his pipe put free too; A dozen times we've well-nigh kill'd him, We've skeer'd him, shaken him, and spill'd him; In fact, done all we deer,” said Jim, “Against a powerful man like him; But all in vain we've hed our sport; Jest like a cat that can't be hurt, With nine good lives if he hev one, Is this same Hiram Higginson!”’ V. Joe ends his Srory—First Glimpse of Utah. Joe paused, for down the mountain's brow, His hastening horses trotted now. Into a canyon green and light, Thro' which a beck was sparkling light, Quickly we wound. Joe Wilson lit His cutty pipe, and suck'd at it In silence grim; and when it drew, Puff after puff of smoke he blew, With blank eye fixed on vacancy. At last he turned again to me, And spoke with bitter indignation The epilogue of his narration. ‘Waal, stranger, guess my story's told, The Apostle beat and I was bowl'd. Reckon I might have won if I Had allays been at hand to try; But I was busy out of sight, And he was theer, morn, noon, and night, Playing his cards, and waal it weer For him I never caught him theer. To cut the story short, I guess He got the Prophet to say “yes,” And Cissy without much ado Gev her consent to hev him too; And one fine morning off they druv To what he called the Abode of Love— A dern'd old place, it seems to me, Jest like a dove-box on a tree, Where every lonesome woman soul Sits shivering in her own hole, And on the outside, free to choose, The old cock-pigeon struts and coos. I've heard from many a one that Ciss Has found her blunder out by this, And she'd prefer for company A brisk young chap, tho' poor, like me, Than the sixth part of him she's won— The holy Hiram Higginson. I've got a peep at her since then, When she's crawl'd out of thet theer den, But she's so pale and thin and tame I shouldn't know her for the same. No flesh to pinch upon her cheek, Her legs gone thin, no voice to speak, Dabby and crush'd, and sad and flabby, Sucking a wretched squeaking baby; And all the fun and all the light Gone from her face, and left it white. Her cheek 'll take a feeble flush, But hesn't blood enough to blush; Tries to seem modest, peart and sly, And brighten up if I go by, But from the corner of her eyes Peeps at me quietly, and sighs. Reckon her luck has been a stinger! She'd bolt if I held up my finger; But tho' I'm rough, and wild, and free, Take a Saint's leavings—no not me! You've heerd of Vampires—them that rise At dead o' night with flaming eyes, And into women's beds 'll creep To suck their blood when they're asleep. I guess these Saints are jest the same, Sucking the life out is their game; And tho' it ain't in the broad sun Or in the open streets it's done, There ain't a woman they clap eyes on Their teeth don't touch, their touch don't pison; Thet's their dern'd way in this yer spot— Grrr! git along, hoss! dern you, trot!’ From pool to pool the wild beck sped Beside us, dwindled to a thread. With mellow verdure fringed around It sang along with summer sound: Here gliding into a green glade; Here darting from a nest of shade With sudden sparkle and quick cry, As glad again to meet the sky; Here whirling off with eager will And quickening tread to turn a mill; Then stealing from the busy place With duskier depths and wearier pace In the blue void above the beck Sailed with us, dwindled to a speck, The hen-hawk; and from pools below The blue-wing'd heron oft rose slow, And upward pass'd with measured beat Of wing to seek some new retreat. Blue was the heaven and darkly bright, Suffused with throbbing golden light, And in the burning Indian ray A million insects hummed at play. Soon, by the margin of the stream, We passed a driver with his team Bound for the City; then a hound Afar off made a dreamy sound; And suddenly the sultry track Left the green canyon at our back, And sweeping round a curve, behold! We came into the yellow gold Of perfect sunlight on the plain; And Joe abruptly drawing rein, Said quick and sharp, shading his eyes With sunburnt hand, ‘See, theer it lies— Theer's Sodom!’ And even as he cried, The mighty Valley we espied, Burning below us in one ray Of liquid light that summer day; And far away, 'mid peaceful gleams Of flocks and herds and glistering streams, Rose, fair as aught that fancy paints, The wondrous City of the Saints! THE CITY OF THE SAINTS. O Saints that shine around the heavenly Seat! What heaven is this that opens at my feet? What flocks are these that thro' the golden gleam Stray on by freckled fields and shining stream? What glittering roofs and white kiosks are these Up-peeping from the shade of emerald trees? Whose City is this that rises on the sight Fair and fantastic as a city of light Seen in the sunset? What is yonder sea Opening beyond the City cool and free, Large, deep, and luminous, looming thro' the heat, And lying at the darkly shadowed feet Of the Sierras, which with jagged line Burning to amber in the light divine, Close in the Valley of the happy land, With heights as barren as a dead man's hand? O pilgrim, halt! O wandering heart, give praise! Behold the City of these Latter Days! Here may'st thou leave thy load and be forgiven, And in anticipation taste of Heaven! I. Among the Pastures—Summer Evening Dialogue. Bishop Pete. Bishop Joss. Stranger. BISHOP PETE. Ah, things down here, as you observe, are getting more pernicious, And Brigham's losing all his nerve, altho' the fix is vicious. Jest as we've rear'd a prosperous place and fill'd our holy quivers, The Yankee comes with dern'd long face to give us all the shivers! And on his jaws a wicked grin prognosticates disaster, And, jest as sure as sin is sin, he means to be the master. ‘Pack up your traps,’ I hear him cry, ‘for here there's no remainin',’ And winks with his malicious eye, and progues us out of Canaan. BISHOP JOSS. It ain't the Yankee that I fear, the neighbour, nor the stranger— No, no, it's closer home, it's here, that I perceive the danger. The wheels of State has gather'd rust, the helm wants hands to guide it, 'Tain't from without the biler'll bust, but 'cause of steam inside it; Yet if we went falootin' less, and made less noise and flurry, It isn't Jonathan, I guess, would hurt us in a hurry. But there's sedition east and west, and secret revolution, There's canker in the social breast, rot in the constitution; And over half of us, at least, are plunged in mad vexation, Forgetting how our race increased, our very creed's foundation. What's our religion's strength and force, its substance, and its story? STRANGER. Polygamy, my friend, of course! the law of love and glory! BISHOP PETE. Stranger, I'm with you there, indeed:—it's been the best of nusses; Polygamy is to our creed what meat and drink to us is. Destroy that notion any day, and all the rest is brittle, And Mormondom dies clean away like one in want of vittle. It's meat and drink, it's life, it's power! to heaven its breath doth win us! It warms our vitals every hour! it's Holy Ghost within us! Jest lay that notion on the shelf, and all life's springs are frozen! I've half a dozen wives myself, and wish I had a dozen! BISHOP JOSS. If all the Elders of the State like you were sound and holy, P. Shufflebotham, guess our fate were far less melancholy. You air a man of blessed toil, far-shining and discerning, A heavenly lamp well trimm'd with oil, upon the altar burning. And yet for every one of us with equal resolution, There's twenty samples of the Cuss, as mean as Brother Clewson. STRANGER. St. Abe? BISHOP JOSS. Yes, him—the snivelling sneak—his very name provokes me,— Altho' my temper's milky-meek, he sours me and he chokes me. To see him going up and down with those meek lips asunder, Jest like a man about to drown, with lead to sink him under, His grey hair on his shoulders shed, one leg than t'other shorter, No end of cuteness in his head, and him— as weak as water! BISHOP PETE. And yet how well I can recall the time when Abe was younger— Why not a chap among us all went for the notion stronger. When to the mother-country he was sent to wake the sinning, He shipp'd young lambs across the sea by flocks—he was so winning; O but he had a lively style, describing saintly blisses! He made the spirit pant and smile, and seek seraphic kisses! How the bright raptures of the Saint fresh lustre seemed to borrow, While black and awful he did paint the one-wived sinner's sorrow! Each woman longed to be his bride, and by his side to slumber— ‘The more the blesseder!’ he cried, still adding to the number. STRANGER. How did the gentleman contrive to change his skin so quickly? BISHOP JOSS. The holy Spirit couldn't thrive because the Flesh was sickly! Tho' day by day he did increase his flock, his soul was shallow, His brains were only candle-grease, and wasted down like tallow. He stoop'd a mighty heap too much, and let his household rule him, The weakness of the man was such that any face could fool him. Ay! made his presence cheap, no doubt, and so contempt grew quicker,— Not measuring his notice out in smallish drams, like liquor. His house became a troublous house, with mischief overbrimmin', And he went creeping like a mouse among the cats of women. Ah, womenfolk are hard to rule, their tricks is most surprising, It's only a dern'd spoony fool goes sentimentalising! But give 'em now and then a bit of notice and a present, And lor, they're just like doves, that sit on one green branch, all pleasant! But Abe's love was a queer complaint, a sort of tertian fever, Each case he cured of thought the Saint a thorough-paced deceiver; And soon he found, he did indeed, with all their whims to nourish, That Mormonism ain't a creed where fleshly follies flourish. BISHOP PETE. Ah, right you air! A creed it is demandin' iron mettle! A will that quells, as soon as riz, the biling of the kettle! With wary eye, with manner deep, a spirit overbrimmin', Like to a shepherd 'mong his sheep, the Saint is 'mong his women; And unto him they do uplift their eyes in awe and wonder; His notice is a blessed gift, his anger is blue thunder. No n'ises vex the holy place where dwell those blessed parties; Each missus shineth in her place, and blithe and meek her heart is! They sow, they spin, they darn, they hem, their blessed babes they handle, The Devil never comes to them, lit by that holy candle! When in their midst serenely walks their Master and their Mentor, They're hush'd, as when the Prophet stalks down holy church's centre! They touch his robe, they do not move, those blessed wives and mothers, And, when on one he shineth love, no envy fills the others; They know his perfect saintliness, and honour his affection— And, if they did object, I guess he'd settle that objection! BISHOP JOSS. It ain't a passionate flat like Abe can manage things in your way! They teased that most etarnal babe, till things were in a poor way. I used to watch his thorny bed, and bust my sides with laughter. Once give a female hoss her head you'll never stop her after. It's one thing getting seal'd, and he was mighty fond of Sealing, He'd all the human heat, d'ye see, without the saintly feeling. His were the wildest set of gals that ever drove man silly, Each full of freaks and fal-de-lals, as frisky as a filly. One pull'd this way, and t'other that, and made his life a mockery, They'd all the feelings of a cat scampaging 'mong the crockery. I saw Abe growing pale and thin, and well I knew what ail'd him— The skunk went stealing out and in, and all his spirit failed him; And tho' the tanning-yard paid well, and he was money-making, His saintly home was hot as Hell, and, ah! how he was baking! Why, now and then at evening-time, when his day's work was over, Up this here hill he used to climb and squat among the clover, And with his fishy eye he'd glare across the Rocky Mountains, And wish he was away up there, among the heavenly fountains! I had an aunt, Tabitha Brooks, a virgin under fifty, She warn't so much for pretty looks, but she was wise and thrifty: She'd seen the vanities of life, was good at 'counts and brewin'— Thinks I, ‘Here's just the sort of Wife to save poor Abe from ruin.’ So, after fooling many a week, and showing him she loved him, And seeing he was shy to speak, whatever feelings moved him, At last I took her by the hand, and led her to him straightway, One day when we could see him stand jest close unto the gateway. My words were to the p'int and brief: says I, ‘My brother Clewson, There'll be an end to all your grief, if you've got resolution. Where shall you find a house that thrives without a head that's ruling? Here is the paragon of wives to teach those others schooling! She'll be to you not only wife, but careful as a mother— A little property for life is hers; you'll share it, brother. I've seen the question morn and eve within your eyes unspoken, You're slow and nervous I perceive, but now—the ice is broken. Here is a guardian and a guide to bless a man and grace him;’ And then I to Tabitha cried, ‘Go in, old gal—embrace him!’ STRANGER. Why, that was acting fresh and fair;—but Abe, was he as hearty? BISHOP JOSS. We . . ll! Abe was never anywhere against a female party! At first he seemed about to run, and then we might have missed him; But Tabby was a tender one, she collar'd him and kissed him. And round his neck she blushing hung, part holding, part caressing, And murmur'd, with a faltering tongue, ‘O, Abe, I'll be a blessing.’ And home they walk'd one morning, he just reaching to her shoulders, And sneaking at her skirt, while she stared straight at all beholders. Swinging her bonnet by the strings, and setting her lips tighter, In at his door the old gal springs, her grim eyes growing brighter; And, Lord! there was the devil to pay, and lightning and blue thunder, For she was going to have her way, and hold the vixens under; They would have torn old Abe to bits, they were so anger-bitten, But Tabby saved him from their fits, as a cat saves her kitten. STRANGER. It seems your patriarchal life has got its botherations, And leads to much domestic strife and infinite vexations! But when the ladies couldn't lodge in peace one house-roof under, I thought that 'twas the saintly dodge to give them homes asunder? BISHOP JOSS. And you thought right; it is a plan by many here affected— Never by me—I ain't the man—I'll have my will respected. If all the women of my house can't fondly pull together, And each as meek as any mouse, look out for stormy weather!— No, no, I don't approve at all of humouring my women, And building lots of boxes small for each one to grow grim in. I teach them jealousy's a sin, and solitude's just bearish, They nuss each other lying-in, each other's babes they cherish; It is a family jubilee, and not a selfish pleasure, Whenever one presents to me another infant treasure! All ekal, all respected, each with tokens of affection, They dwell together, soft of speech, beneath their lord's protection; And if by any chance I mark a spark of shindy raising, I set my heel upon that spark,—before the house gets blazing! Now that's what Clewson should have done, but couldn't, thro' his folly, For even when Tabby's help was won, he wasn't much more jolly. Altho' she stopt the household fuss, and husht the awful riot, The old contrairy stupid Cuss could not enj'y the quiet. His house was peaceful as a church, all solemn, still, and saintly; And yet he'd tremble at the porch, and look about him faintly; And tho' the place was all his own, with hat in hand he'd enter, Like one thro' public buildings shown, soft treading down the centre. Still, things were better than before, though somewhat trouble-laden, When one fine day unto his door there came a Yankee maiden. ‘Is Brother Clewson in?’ she says; and when she saw and knew him. The stranger gal to his amaze scream'd out and clung unto him. Then in a voice all thick and wild, exclaim'd that gal unlucky, ‘O Sir, I'm Jason Jones's child—he's dead —stabb'd in Kentucky! And father's gone, and O I've come to you across the mountains.’ And then the little one was dumb, and Abe's eyes gushed like fountains. . . . He took that gal into his place, and kept her as his daughter— Ah, mischief to her wheedling face and the bad wind that brought her! BISHOP PETE. I knew that Jones;—used to faloot about Emancipation— It made your very toe-nails shoot to hear his declamation. And when he'd made all bosoms swell with wonder at his vigour, He'd get so drunk he couldn't tell a white man from a nigger! Was six foot high, thin, grim, and pale,— his troubles can't be spoken— Tarred, feathered, ridden on a rail, left beaten, bruised, and broken; But nothing made his tongue keep still, or stopt his games improper, Till, after many an awkward spill, he came the final cropper. BISHOP JOSS. . . . That gal was fourteen years of age, and sly with all her meekness; It put the fam'ly in a rage, for well they knew Abe's weakness. But Abe (a cuss, as I have said, that any fool might sit on) Was stubborn as an ass's head, when once he took the fit on! And, once he fixed the gal to take, in spite of their vexation, Not all the rows on earth would break his firm determination. He took the naggings as they came, he bowed his head quite quiet, Still mild he was and sad and tame, and ate the peppery diet; But tho' he seemed so crush'd to be, when this or that one blew up, He stuck to Jones's Legacy and school'd her till she grew up. Well! there! the thing was said and done, and so far who could blame him? But O he was a crafty one, and sorrow couldn't shame him! That gal grew up, and at eighteen was prettier far and neater— There were not many to be seen about these parts to beat her; Peart, brisk, bright-eyed, all trim and tight, like kittens fond of playing, A most uncommon pleasant sight at pic-nic or at praying, Then it became, as you'll infer, a simple public duty, To cherish and look after her, considering her beauty; And several Saints most great and blest now offer'd their protection, And I myself among the rest felt something of affection. But O the selfishness of Abe, all things it beats and passes! As greedy as a two-year babe a-grasping at molasses! When once those Shepherds of the flock began to smile and beckon, He screamed like any fighting cock, and raised his comb, I reckon! First one was floor'd, then number two, she wouldn't look at any; Then my turn came, although I knew the maiden's faults were many. ‘My brother Abe,’ says I, ‘I come untoe your house at present To offer sister Anne a home which she will find most pleasant. You know I am a saintly man, and all my ways are lawful’— And in a minute he began abusing me most awful. ‘Begone,’ he said, ‘you're like the rest,— wolves, wolves with greedy clutches! Poor little lamb, but in my breast I'll shield her from your touches!’ ‘Come, come,’ says I, ‘a gal can't stay a child like that for ever, You'll hev to seal the gal some day;’ but Abe cried fiercely, ‘Never!’ Says I, ‘Perhaps it's in your view yourself this lamb to gather?’ And ‘If it is, what's that to you?’ he cried; ‘but I'm her father! You get along, I know your line, it's crushing, bullying, wearing, You'll never seal a child of mine, so go, and don't stand staring!’ This was the man once mild in phiz as any farthing candle— A hedgehog now, his quills all riz, whom no one dared to handle! But O I little guessed his deal, nor tried to circumvent it, I never thought he'd dare to seal another; but he meant it! Yes, managed Brigham on the sly, for fear his plans miscarried, And long before we'd time to cry, the two were sealed and married. BISHOP PETE. Well, you've your consolation now—he's punish'd clean, I'm thinking, He's ten times deeper in the slough, up to his neck and sinking. There's vinegar in Abe's pale face enough to sour a barrel, Goes crawling up and down the place, neglecting his apparel, Seems to have lost all heart and soul, has fits of absence shocking— His home is like a rabbit's hole when weasels come a-knocking. And now and then, to put it plain, while falling daily sicker, I think he tries to float his pain by copious goes of liquor. BISHOP JOSS. Yes, that's the end of selfishness, it leads to long vexation— No man can pity Abe, I guess, who knows his situation; And, Stranger, if this man you meet, don't take him for a sample, Although he speaks you fair and sweet, he's set a vile example. Because you see him ill at ease, at home, and never hearty, Don't think these air the tokens, please, of a real saintly party! No, he's a failure, he's a sham, a scandal to our nation, Not fit to lead a single lamb, unworthy of his station; No! if you want a Saint to see, who rules lambs when he's got 'em, Just cock your weather-eye at me, or Brother Shufflebotham. We don't go croaking east and west, afraid of women's faces, We bless and we air truly blest in our domestic places; We air religious, holy men, happy our folds to gather, Each is a loyal citizen, also a husband— rather. But now with talk you're dry and hot, and weary with your ride here, Jest come and see my fam'ly lot,—they're waiting tea inside here. II. Within the City. St. Abe and the Seven. Sister Tabitha, thirty odd, Rising up with a stare and a nod; Sister Amelia, sleepy and mild, Freckled, Dudu-ish, suckling a child; Sister Fanny, pert and keen, Sister Emily, solemn and lean, Sister Mary, given to tears, Sister Sarah, with wool in her ears;— All appearing like tapers wan In the mellow sunlight of Sister Anne. With a tremulous wave of his hand, the Introduces the household quaint, And sinks on a chair and looks around, As the dresses rustle with snakish sound, As curtsies are bobb'd, and eyes cast Some with a simper, some with a frown. And Sister Anne, with a fluttering breast, Stands trembling and peeping behind the rest. Every face but one has been Pretty, perchance, at the age of eighteen Pert and pretty, and plump and bright But now their fairness is faded quite, And every feature is fashion'd here To a flabby smile, or a snappish sneer. Before the stranger they each assume A false fine flutter and feeble bloom, And a little colour comes into the cheek When the eyes meet mine, as I sit and speak; But there they sit and look at me, Almost withering visibly, And languidly tremble and try to blow— Six pale roses all in a row! Six? ah, yes; but at hand sits one, The seventh, still full of the light of the sun. Though her colour terribly comes and goes, Now white as a lily, now red as a rose, So sweet she is, and so full of light, That the rose seems soft, and the lily bright. Her large blue eyes, with a tender care, Steal to her husband unaware, And whenever he feels them he flushes red, And the trembling hand goes up to his head! Around those dove-like eyes appears A redness as of recent tears. Alone she sits in her youth's fresh bloom In a dark corner of the room, And folds her hands, and does not stir, And the others scarcely look at her, But crowding together, as if by plan, Draw further and further from Sister Anne. I try to rattle along in chat, Talking freely of this and that— The crops, the weather, the mother-land, Talk a baby could understand; And the faded roses, faint and meek, Open their languid lips to speak, But in various sharps and flats, all low, Gave a lazy ‘yes’ or a sleepy ‘no.’ Yet now and then Tabitha speaks, Snapping her answer with yellow cheeks, And fixing the Saint who is sitting by With the fish-like glare of her glittering eye, Whenever the looks of the weary man Stray to the corner of Sister Anne. Like a fountain in a shady place Is the gleam of the sadly shining face— A fresh spring whither the soul might turn, When the road is rough, and the hot sands burn; Like a fount, or a bird, or a blooming tree, To a weary spirit is such as she! And Brother Abe, from his easy chair, Looks thither by stealth with an aching care, And in spite of the dragons that guard the brink Would stoop to the edge of the fount, I think, And drink! and drink! ‘Drink? Stuff and fiddlesticks,’ you cry. Matron reader with flashing eye: ‘Isn't the thing completely his, His wife, his mistress, whatever you please? Look at her! Dragons and fountains! Absurd!’ Madam, I bow to every word; But truth is truth, and cannot fail, And this is quite a veracious tale. More like a couple of lovers shy, Who flush and flutter when folk are by, Were man and wife, or (in another And holier parlance) sister and brother. As a man of the world I noticed it, And it made me speculate a bit, For the situation was to my mind A phenomenon of a curious kind— A person in love with his wife, 'twas clear, But afraid, when another soul was near, Of showing his feelings in any way Because—there would be the Devil to pay! The Saint has been a handsome fellow. Clear-eyed, fresh-skinn'd, if a trifle yellow, And his face, though somewhat soft and plain, Ends in a towering mass of brain. His locks, though still an abundant crop, Are thinning a little at the top, But you only notice here and there The straggling gleam of a silver hair. A man by nature rolled round and short, Meant for the Merry Andrew's sport, But sober'd down by the wear and tear Of business troubles and household care: Quiet, reticent, gentle, kind, Of amorous heart and extensive mind, A Saint devoid of saintly sham, Is little Brother Abraham. Brigham's right hand he used to be— Mild though he seems, and simple, and free; Sound in the ways of the world, and great In planning potent affairs of state; Not bright, nor bumptious, you must know, Too retiring for popular show, But known to conceive on a startling scale Gigantic plans that never fail; To hold with a certain secret sense The Prophet under his influence, To be, I am led to understand, The Brain, while the Prophet is the Hand, And to see his intellectual way Thro' moral dilemmas of every day, By which the wisest are led astray. Here's the Philosopher!—here he sits, Here, with his vaguely wandering wits, Among the dragons, as I have said, Smiling, and holding his hand to his head. What mighty thoughts are gathering now Behind that marble mass of brow? What daring schemes of polity To set the popular conscience free, And bless humanity, planneth he? His talk is idle, a surface-gleam, The ripple on the rest of the stream, But his thoughts—ah, his thoughts—where do they fly, While the wretched roses under his eye Flutter and peep? and in what doth his plan Turn to the counsel of Sister Anne? For his eyes give ever a questioning look, And the little one in her quiet nook Flashes an answer, and back again The question runs to the Brother's brain, And the lights of speculation flit Over his face and trouble it. Follow his eyes once more, and scan The fair young features of Sister Anne: Frank and innocent, and in sooth Full of the first fair flush of youth. Quite a child—nineteen years old; Not gushing, and self-possessed, and bold, Like our Yankee women at nineteen, But low of voice, and mild of mien— More like the fresh young fruit you see In the mother-land across the sea— More like that rosiest flower on earth, A blooming maiden of English birth, Such as we find them yet awhile Scatter'd about the homely Isle, Not yet entirely eaten away By the canker-novel of the day, Or curling up and losing their scent In a poisonous dew from the Continent. There she sits, in her quiet nook, Still bright tho' sadden'd; and while I look, My heart is filled and my eyes are dim, And I hate the Saint when I turn to him! Ogre! Blue Beard! Oily and sly! His meekness a cheat, his quiet a lie! A roaring lion he'll walk the house Tho' now he crouches like any mouse! Had not he pluck'd enough and to spare Of roses like these set fading there, But he must seek to cajole and kiss Another yet, and a child like this? A maid on the stalk, just panting to prove The honest joy of a virgin love; A girl, a baby, an innocent child, To be caught by the first man's face that smiled! Scarce able the difference to fix Of polygamy and politics! Led to the altar like a lamb, And sacrificed to the great god Sham! Deluded, martyr'd, given to woe, Last of seven who have perish'd so; For who can say but the flowers I see Were once as rosy and ripe as she? Already the household worm has begun To feed on the cheeks of the little one; Already her spirit, fever-fraught, Droops to the weight of its own thought; Already she saddens and sinks and sighs, Watched by the jealous dragonish eyes. Even Amelia, sleepy and wan, Sharpens her orbs as she looks at Anne; While Sister Tabby, when she can spare Her gaze from the Saint in his easy-chair, Fixes her with a gorgon glare. All is still and calm and polite, The Sisters bolster themselves upright, And try 'to smile, but the atmosphere Is charged with thunder and lightning here. Heavy it seems, and close and warm, Like the air before a summer storm; And at times,—as in that drowsy dream Preluding thunder, all sounds will seem Distinct and ominously clear, And the far-off cocks seem crowing near;— Ev'n so in the pauses of talk, each breast Is strangely conscious of the rest, And the tick of the watch of Abe the Saint Breaks on the air, distinct though faint, Like the ticking of his heart! I rise To depart, still glancing with piteous eyes On Sister Anne; and I find her face Turn'd questioning still to the same old place— The face of the Saint. I stand and bow, Curtsies again are bobbing now, Dresses rustling . . . I know no more Till the Saint has led me to the door, And I find myself in a day-dream dim, Just after shaking hands with him, Standing and watching him sad and slow Into the dainty dwelling go, With a heavy sigh, and his hand to his head. . . . Hark, distant thunder!—'tis as I said: The air was far too close;—at length The Storm is breaking in all its strength. III. Promenade—Main Street, Utah. THE STRANGER. Along the streets they're thronging, walking, Clad gaily in their best and talking, Women and children, quite a crowd; The bright sun overhead is blazing, The people sweat, the dust they're raising Arises like a golden cloud. Still out of every door they scatter, Laughing and light. Pray what's the matter, That such a flock of folks I see? A LOUNGER. They're off to hear the Prophet patter, This yer's a day of jubilee. VOICES. Come along, we're late I reckon. . . There's our Matt, I see him beckon. . . How d'ye do, marm? glad to meet you. . . Silence, Hiram, or I'll beat you. . . Emm, there's brother Jones a-looking. . . Here's warm weather, how I'm cooking! STRANGER. Afar the hills arise with cone and column Into a sky of brass serene and solemn; And underneath their shadow in one haze Of limpid heat the great salt waters blaze, While faint and filmy through the sultry veil The purple islands on their bosom sail Like floating clouds of dark fantastic air. How strangely sounds (while 'mid the Indian glare Moves the gay crowd of people old and young) The bird-like chirp of the old Saxon tongue! The women seem half weary and half gay, Their eyes droop in a melancholy way,— I have not seen a merry face to-day. A BISHOP. Thet's a smart hoss you're riding, brother! How are things looking, down with you? SECOND BISHOP. Not over bright with one nor 'tother, Taters are bad, tomatoes blue. You've heer'd of Brother Simpson's losses?— Buried his wife and spiled his hay. And the three best of Hornby's hosses Some Injin cuss has stol'n away. VOICES. Zoë, jest fix up my gown. . . There's my hair a-coming down. . . Drat the babby, he's so crusty— It's the heat as makes him thusty. . . Come along, I'm almost sinking. . . There's a stranger, and he's winking. STRANGER. That was a fine girl with the grey-hair'd lady, How shining were her eyes, how true and steady, Not drooping down in guilty Mormon fashion, But shooting at the soul their power and passion. That's a big fellow, six foot two, not under, But how he struts, and looks as black as thunder, Half glancing round at his poor sheep to scare 'em— Six, seven, eight, nine,—O Abraham, what a harem! All berry brown, but looking scared as may be, And each one but the oldest with a baby. A GIRL. Phœbe! ANOTHER. Yes, Grace! FIRST GIRL. Don't seem to notice, dear, That Yankee from the camp again is here, Making such eyes, and following on the sly, And coughing now and then to show he's nigh. SECOND GIRL. Who's that along with him—the little scamp Shaking his hair and nodding with a smile? FIRST GIRL. Guess he's some new one just come down to camp. SECOND GIRL. Isn't he handsome? FIRST GIRL. No; the first's my style! STRANGER. If my good friends, the Saints, could get their will, These Yankee officers would fare but ill; Wherever they approach the folk retire, As if from veritable coals of fire; With distant bow, set lips, and half-hid frown, The Bishops pass them in the blessed town; The women come behind like trembling sheep, Some freeze to ice, some blush and steal a peep. And often, as a band of maidens gay Comes up, each maid ceases to talk and play, Droops down her eyes, and does not look their way; But after passing where the youngsters pine, All giggle as at one concerted sign, And tripping on with half-hush'd merry cries, Look boldly back with laughter in their eyes! VOICES. Here we are, . . how folk are pushing! . . Mind the babby in the crushing. . . Pheemy! . . Yes, John! . . Don't go staring At that Yankee—it's past bearing. Draw your veil down while he passes, Reckon you're as bold as brass is. ABE CLEWSON. (Passing with his hand to his head, attended by his Wives.) Head in a whirl, and heart in a flutter, Guess I don't know the half that I utter. Too much of this life is beginning to try me, I'm like a dern'd miller the grind always nigh me; Praying don't soothe me nor comfort me any, My house is too full and my blessings too many— The ways o' the wilderness puzzle me greatly. SISTER TABITHA. Do walk like a Christian, and keep kind o' stately! And jest keep an eye on those persons behind you, You call 'em your Wives, but they tease you and blind yon; Sister Anne's a disgrace, tho' you think her a martyr, And she's tuck'd up her petticoat nigh to her garter. STRANGER. What group is this, begrim'd with dust and heat, Staring like strangers in the open street? The women, ragged, wretched, and half dead, Sit on the kerbstone hot and hang the head, And clustering at their side stand children brown, Weary, with wondering eyes on the fair town. Close by in knots beside the unhorsed team The sunburn'd men stand talking in a dream, For the vast tracts of country left behind Seem now a haunting mirage in the mind. Gaunt miners folding hands upon their breasts, Big-jointed labourers looking ox-like down, And sickly artizans with narrow chests Still pallid from the smoke of English town. Hard by to these a group of Teutons stand, Light hair'd, blue-eyed, still full of Father-land, With water-loving Northmen, who grow gay To see the mimic sea gleam far away. Now to this group, with a sharp questioning face, Cometh a holy magnate of the place In decent black; shakes hands with some; and then Begins an eager converse with the men: All brighten; even the children hush their cries, And the pale women smile with sparkling eyes. BISHOP. The Prophet welcomes you, and sends His message by my mouth, my friends; He'll see you snug, for on this shore There's heaps of room for millions more! . . Scotchman, I take it? . . Ah, I know Glasgow—was there a year or so. . . And if you don't from Yorkshire hail, I'll—ah, I thought so; seldom fail. Make yourselves snug and rest a spell, There's liquor coming—meat as well. All welcome! We keep open door— Ah, we don't push away the poor; Tho' he's a fool, you understand, Who keeps poor long in this here land. The land of honey you behold— Honey and milk—silver and gold! AN ARTIZAN. Ah, that's the style—Bess, just you hear it; Come, come, old gal, keep up your spirit: Silver and gold, and milk and honey, This is the country for our money! A GERMAN. Es lebe die Stadt! es lebe dran! Das heilige Leben steht mir an! A NORTHMAN. Taler du norske? BISHOP. (Shaking his head, and turning with a wink to the English.) No, not me! Saxon's the language of the free! The language of the great Evangels! The language of the Saints and Angels! The only speech that Joseph knew! The speech of him and Brigham too! Only the speech by which we've thriven Is comprehended up in Heaven! . . Poor heathens! but we'll make 'em spry, They'll talk like Christians by-and-by. STRANGER. (Strolling out of the streets.) From east, from west, from every worn-out land, Yearly they stream to swell this busy band. Out of the fever'd famine of the slums, From sickness, shame, and sorrow, Lazarus comes, Drags his sore limbs o'er half the world and sea, Seeking for freedom and felicity. The sewer of ignorance and shame and loss, Draining old Europe of its dirt and dross, Grows the great City by the will of God; While wondrously out of the desert sod, Nourished with lives unclean and weary hearts, The new faith like a splendid weed upstarts. A splendid weed! rather a fair wild-flower, Strange to the eye in its first birth of power, But bearing surely in its breast the seeds Of higher issues and diviner deeds. Changed from Sahara to a fruitful vale Fairer than ever grew in fairy tale, Transmuted into plenteous field and glade By the slow magic of the white man's spade, Grows Deseret, filling its mighty nest Between the eastern mountains and the west, While—who goes there? What shape antique looks down From this green mound upon the festive town, With tall majestic figure darkly set Against the sky in dusky silhouette? Strange his attire: a blanket edged with red Wrapt royally around him; on his head A battered hat of the strange modern sort Which men have christened ‘chimney pots’ in sport; Mocassins on his feet, fur-fringed and grand, And a large green umbrella in his hand. Pensive he stands with deep-lined dreamy face, Last living remnant of the mighty race Who on these hunting-fields for many a year Chased the wild buflalo, and elk, and deer Heaven help him! In his mien grief and despair Seem to contend, as he stands musing there; Until he notices that I am nigh, And lo! with outstretched hands and glistening eye Swift he descends—Does he mean mischief? No; He smiles and beckons as I turn to go. INDIAN. Me Medicine Crow. White man gib drink to me. Great chief; much squaw; papoose, sah, one, two, three! STRANGER. With what a leer, half wheedling and half winking, The lost one imitates the act of drinking; His nose already, to his woe and shame, Carbuncled with the white man's liquid flame! Well, I pull out my flask, and fill a cup Of burning rum—how quick he gulps it up; And in a moment in his trembling grip Thrusts out the cup for more with thirsty lip. But no !—already drunken past a doubt, Degenerate nomad of the plains, get out! [A railway whistle sounds in the far distance.Fire-hearted Demon tamed to human hand, Rushing with smoky breath from land to land, Screaming aloud to scare with rage and wrath Primæval ignorance before his path, Dragging behind him as he runs along His lilliputian masters, pale and strong, With melancholy sound for plain and hill Man's last Familiar Spirit whistles shrill. Poor devil of the plains, now spent and frail, Hovering wildly on the fatal trail, Pass on!—there lies thy way and thine abode, Get out of Jonathan thy master's road. Where? anywhere!—he's not particular where, So that you clear the road, he does not care; Off, quick! clear out! ay, drink your fill and die; And, since the Earth rejects you, try the Sky! And see if He, who sent your white-faced brother To hound and drive you from this world you bother, Can find a corner for you in another! IV. Within the Synagogue. Sermonizeth the Prophet. THE PROPHET. Sisters and brothers who love the right, Saints whose hearts are divinely beating, Children rejoicing in the light, I reckon this is a pleasant meeting. Where's the face with a look of grief?— Jehovah's with us and leads the battle; We've had a harvest beyond belief, And the signs of fever have left the cattle; All still blesses the holy life Here in the land of milk and honey. FEMININE WHISPERS. Brother Shuttleworth's seventeenth wife, . . Her with the heer brushed up so funny! THE PROPHET. Out of Egypt hither we flew, Through the desert and rocky places; The people murmur'd, and all look'd blue, The bones of the martyr'd filled our traces. Mountain and valley we crawl'd along, And every morning our hearts beat quicker. Our flesh was weak, but our souls were strong, And we'd managed to carry some kegs of liquor. At last we halted on yonder height, Just as the sun in the west was blinking. FEMININE WHISPERS. Isn't Jedge Hawkins's last a fright? . . . I'm suttin that Brother Abe's been drinking! THE PROPHET. That night, my lambs, in a wondrous dream, I saw the gushing of many fountains; Soon as the morning began to beam, Down we went from yonder mountains, Found the water just where I thought, Fresh and good, though a trifle gritty, Pitch'd our tents in the plain, and wrought The site and plan of the Holy City. ‘Pioneers of the blest,’ I cried, ‘Dig, and the Lord will bless each spadeful. FEMININE WHISPERS. Brigham's sealed to another Bride . . . How worn he's gittin'! he's aging dreadful. THE PROPHET. This is a tale so often told, The theme of every eventful meeting; Yes! you may smile and think it old; But yet it's a tale that will bear repeating. That's how the City of Light began, That's how we founded the saintly nation, All by the spade and the arm of man, And the aid of a special dispensation. ‘Work’ was the word when we begun, ‘Work’ is the word now we have plenty. FEMININE WHISPERS. Heard about Sister Euphemia's son? . . . Sealing already, though only twenty! THE PROPHET. I say just now what I used to say, Though it moves the heathens to mock and laughter, From work to prayer is the proper way— Labour first, and Religion after. Let a big man, strong in body and limb, Come here inquiring about his Maker, This is the question I put to him, ‘Can you grow a cabbage, or reap an acre?’ What's the soul but a flower sublime, Grown in the earth and upspringing surely? FEMININE WHISPERS. O yes! she's hed a most dreadful time! Twins, both thriving, though she's so poorly. THE PROPHET. Beauty, my friends, is the crown of life, To the young and foolish seldom granted; After a youth of honest strife Comes the reward for which you've panted. O blessed sight beyond compare, When life with its halo of light is rounded, To see a Saint with reverend hair Sitting like Solomon love-surrounded! One at his feet and one on his knee, Others around him, blue-eyed and dreamy! FEMININE WHISPERS. All very well, but as for me, My man had better!—I'd pison him, Pheemy! THE PROPHET. There in the gate of Paradise The Saint is sitting serene and hoary, Tendrils of arms, and blossoms of eyes, Festoon him round in his place of glory; Little cherubs float thick as bees Round about him, and murmur ‘father!’ The sun shines bright and he sits at ease, Fruit all round for his hand to gather. Blessed is he and for ever gay, Floating to Heaven and adding to it! FEMININE WHISPERS. Thought I should have gone mad that day He brought a second; I made him rue it! THE PROPHET. Sisters and Brothers by love made wise, Remember, when Satan attempts to quell you, If this here Earth isn't Paradise You'll never see it, and so I tell you. Dig and drain, and harrow and sow, God will bless you beyond all measure; Labour, and meet with reward below, For what is the end of all labour? Pleasure! Labour's the vine, and pleasure's the grape, The one delighting, the other bearing. FEMININE WHISPERS. Higginson's third is losing her shape. She hes too many—it's dreadful wearing. THE PROPHET. But I hear some awakening spirit cry, ‘Labour is labour, and all men know it; But what is pleasure?’ and I reply, Grace abounding and Wives to show it! Holy is he beyond compare Who tills his acres and takes his blessing, Who sees around him everywhere Sisters soothing and babes caressing. And his delight is Heaven's as well, For swells he not the ranks of the chosen? FEMININE WHISPERS. Martha is growing a handsome gel. . . . Three at a birth?—that makes the dozen. THE PROPHET. Learning's a shadow, and books a jest, One Book's a Light, but the rest are human. The kind of study that I think best Is the use of a spade and the love of a woman. Here and yonder, in heaven and earth, By big Salt Lake and by Eden river, The finest sight is a man of worth, Never tired of increasing his quiver. He sits in the light of perfect grace With a dozen cradles going together! FEMININE WHISPERS. The babby's growing black in the face! Carry him out—it's the heat of the weather! THE PROPHET. A faithful vine at the door of the Lord, A shining flower in the garden of spirits, A lute whose strings are of sweet accord, Such is the person of saintly merits. Sisters and brothers, behold and strive Up to the level of his perfection; Sow, and harrow, and dig, and thrive, Increase according to God's direction. This is the Happy Land, no doubt, Where each may flourish in his vocation. . . . Brother Bantam will now give out The hymn of love and of jubilation. V. The Falling of the Thunderbolt. Deep and wise beyond expression Sat the Prophet holding session, And his Elders, round him sitting With a gravity befitting, Never rash and never fiery, Chew'd the cud of each inquiry, Weigh'd each question and discussed it, Sought to settle and adjust it, Till, with sudden indication Of a gush of inspiration, The grave Prophet from their middle Gave the answer to their riddle, And the lesser lights all holy, Round the Lamp revolving slowly, Thought, with eyes and lips asunder, ‘Right, we reckon he's a wonder!’ Whether Boyes, that blessed brother, Should be sealed unto another, Having, tho' a Saint most steady, Very many wives already? Whether it was held improper, If a woman drank, to drop her? Whether unto Brother Fleming Formal praise would be beseeming, Since from three or four potatoes (Not much bigger than his great toes) He'd extracted, to their wonder, Four stone six and nothing under? Whether Bigg be reprimanded For his conduct underhanded, Since he'd packed his prettiest daughter To a heathen o'er the water? How, now Thompson had departed, His poor widows, broken-hearted, Should be settled? They were seven, Sweet as cherubs up in heaven; Three were handsome, young, and pleasant, And had offers on at present— Must they take them? . . . These and other Questions proffer'd by each brother, The great Prophet ever gracious, Free and easy, and sagacious, Answer'd after meditation With sublime deliberation; And his answers were so clever Each one whisper'd, ‘Well, I never!’ And the lesser lights all holy, Round the Prophet turning slowly, Raised their reverend heads and hoary, Thinking, ‘To the Prophet, glory! Hallelujah, veneration! Reckon that he licks creation!’ Suddenly as they sat gleaming, On them came an unbeseeming Murmur, tumult, and commotion, Like the breaking of the ocean; And before a word was utter'd, In rush'd one with voice that fluttered, Arms uplifted, face the colour Of a bran-new Yankee dollar, Like a man whose wits are addled, Crying—‘Brother Abe's skedaddled!’ Then those Elders fearful-hearted Raised a loud cry and upstarted, But the Prophet, never rising, Said, ‘Be calm! this row's surprising!’ And as each Saint sank unsinew'd In his arm-chair he continued: ‘Goodman Jones, your cheeks are yellow, Tell thy tale, and do not bellow! What's the reason of your crying— Is our brother dead?—or dying?’ As the Prophet spake, supremely Hushing all the strife unseemly, Sudden in the room there entered Shapes on whom all eyes were centred— Six sad female figures moaning, Trembling, weeping, and intoning, ‘We are widows broken-hearted— Abraham Clewson has departed!’ While the Saints again upleaping Joined their voices to the weeping, For a moment the great Prophet Trembled, and look'd dark as Tophet. But the cloud pass'd over lightly. ‘Cease!’ he cried, but sniffled slightly, ‘Cease this murmur and be quiet— Dead men won't awake with riot. 'Tis indeed a loss stupendous— When will Heaven his equal send us? Speak, then, of our brother cherish'd, Was it fits by which he perish'd? Or did Death come even quicker, Thro' a bolting horse or kicker?’ At the Prophet's question scowling, All the Wives stood moaning, howling, Crying wildly in a fever, ‘O the villain! the deceiver!’ But the oldest stepping boldly, Curtseying to the Session coldly, Cried in voice like cracking thunder, ‘Prophet, don't you make a blunder! Abraham Clewson isn't dying— Hasn't died, as you're implying; No! he's not the man, my brothers, To die decently like others! Worse! he's from your cause revolted— Run away! skedaddled! bolted!’ Bolted! run away! skedaddled! Like to men whose wits are addled, Echoed all those Lights so holy, Round the Prophet shining slowly And the Prophet, undissembling, Underneath the blow sat trembling, While the perspiration hovered On his forehead, and he covered With one trembling hand his features From the gaze of smaller creatures. Then at last the high and gifted Cough'd and craved, with hands uplifted, Silence. When 'twas given duly, ‘This,’ said he, ‘'s a crusher truly! Brother Clewson fall'n from glory! I can scarce believe your story. O my Saints, each in his station, Join in prayer and meditation!’ Covering up each eyelid saintly With a finger-tip, prayed faintly, Shining in the church's centre, Their great Prophet, Lamp, and Mentor; And the lesser Lights all holy, Round the Lamp revolving slowly, Each upon his seat there sitting, With a gravity befitting, Bowed their reverend heads and hoary, Saying, ‘To the Prophet glory! Hallelujah, veneration! Reckon that he licks creation!’ Lastly, when the trance was ended, And, with face where sorrow blended Into pity and compassion, Shone the Light in common fashion; Forth the Brother stept who brought them First the news which had distraught them, And, while stood the Widows weeping, Gave into the Prophet's keeping A seal'd paper, which the latter Read, as if 'twere solemn matter— Gravely pursing lips and nodding, While they watch'd in dark foreboding, Till at last, with voice that quivered, He these woeful words delivered:— ‘Sisters, calm your hearts unruly, 'Tis an awful business truly; Weeping now will save him never, He's as good as lost for ever; Yes, I say with grief unspoken, Jest a pane crack'd, smash'd, and broken In the windows of the Temple— Crack'd 's the word—so take example! Had he left ye one and all here, On our holy help to call here, Fled alone from every fetter, I could comprehend it better! Flying, not with some strange lady, But with her he had already, With his own seal'd Wife eloping— It's a case of craze past hoping! List, O Saints, each in his station, To the idiot's explanation!’ Then, while now and then the holy Broke the tale of melancholy With a grunt contempt expressing, And the Widows made distressing Murmurs of recrimination Here and there in the narration, The great Prophet in affliction Read this awful Valediction. VI. Last Epistle of St. Abe to the Polygamists. O Brother, Prophet of the Light!—don't let my state distress you, While from the depths of darkest night I cry, ‘Farewell! God bless you!’ I don't deserve a parting tear, nor even a malediction, Too weak to fill a saintly sphere, I yield to my affliction; Down like a cataract I shoot into the depths below you; While you stand wondering and mute, my last adieu I throw you; Commending to your blessed care my well-beloved spouses, My debts (there's plenty and to spare to pay them), lands, and houses, My sheep, my cattle, farm and fold, yea, all by which I've thriven: These to be at the auction sold, and to my widows given. Bless them! to prize them at their worth was far beyond my merit, Just make them think me in the earth, a poor departed spirit. I couldn't bear to say good-bye, and see their tears up-starting; I thought it best to pack and fly without the pain of parting! O tell Amelia, if she can, by careful education, To make her boy grow up a man of strength and saintly station! Tell Fanny to beware of men, and say I'm still her debtor— Tho' she cut sharpish now and then, I think it made me better! Let Emily still her spirit fill with holy consolations— Seraphic soul, I hear her still a-reading ‘Revelations!’ Bid Mary now to dry her tears—she's free of her chief bother; And comfort Sarah—I've my fears she's going to be a mother; And to Tabitha give for me a tender kiss of healing— Guilt wrings my soul—I seem to see that well-known face appealing! And now,—before my figure fades for ever from your vision, Before I mingle with the shades beyond your light Elysian, Now, while your faces all turn pale, and you raise eyes and shiver, Let me a round unvarnish'd tale (as Shakspere says) deliver; And let there be a warning text in my most shameful story, When some poor sheep, perplext and vext, goes seeking too much glory. O Brigham, think of my poor fate, a scandal to beholders, And don't again put too much weight before you've tried the shoulders! Though I'd the intellectual gift, and knew the rights and reasons; Though I could trade, and save, and shift, according to the seasons; Though I was thought a clever man, and was at spouting splendid,— Just think how finely I began, and see how all has ended! In principle unto this hour I'm still a holy being— But oh, how poorly is my power proportion'd to my seeing! You've all the logic on your side, you're right in each conclusion, And yet how vainly have I tried, with eager resolution! My will was good, I felt the call, although my strength was meagre, There wasn't one among you all to serve the Lord more eager! I never tired in younger days of drawing lambs unto me, My lot was one to bless and praise, the fire of faith thrill'd through me. And you, believing I was strong, smiled on me like a father,— Said, ‘Blessëd be this man, though young, who the sweet lambs doth gather!’ At first it was a time full blest, and all my earthly pleasure Was gathering lambs unto my breast to cherish and to treasure; Ay, one by one, for heaven's sake, my female flock I found me, Until one day I did awake and heard them bleating round me, And there was sorrow in their eyes, and mute reproach and wonder, For they perceived to their surprise their Shepherd was a blunder. O Brigham, think of it and weep, my firm and saintly Master— The Pastor trembled at his Sheep, the Sheep despised the Pastor! O listen to the tale of dread, thou Light that shines so brightly— Virtue's a horse that drops down dead if overloaded slightly! She's all the will, she wants to go, she'd carry every tittle; But when you see her flag and blow, just ease her of a little! One wife for me was near enough, two might have fixed me neatly, Three made me shake, four made me puff, five settled me completely,— But when the sixth came, though I still was glad and never grumbled, I took the staggers, kick'd, went ill, and in the traces tumbled! Ah, well may I compare my state unto a beast's position— Unfit to bear a saintly weight, I sank and lost condition; I lack'd the moral nerve and thew, to fill so fine a station— Ah, if I'd had a head like you, and your determination! Instead of going in and out, like a superior party, I was too soft of heart, no doubt, too open, and too hearty. When I began with each young sheep I was too free and loving, Not being strong and wise and deep, I set her feelings moving; And so, instead of noticing the gentle flock in common, I waken'd up that mighty thing—the Spirit of a Woman. Each got to think me, don't you see,—so foolish was the feeling,— Her own especial property, which all the rest were stealing! And, since I could not give to each the whole of my attention, All came to grief, and parts of speech too delicate to mention! Bless them! they loved me far too much, they erred in their devotion, I lack'd the proper saintly touch, subduing mere emotion:— The solemn air sent from the skies, so cold, so tranquillising, That on the female waters lies, and keeps the same from rising, But holds them down all smooth and bright, and, if some wild wind storms 'em, Comes like a cold frost in the night, and into ice transforms 'em! And there, between ourselves, I see the difficulty growing, Since most men are as meek as me, too passionate and glowing; They cannot in your royal way dwell like a guest from Heaven Within this tenement of clay, which for the Soul is given; They cannot like a blessed guest come calm and strong into it, Eating and drinking of its best, and calmly gazing thro' it. No, every mortal's not a Saint, and truly very few are, So weak they are, they cannot paint what holy men like you are. Instead of keeping well apart the Flesh and Spirit, brother, And making one with cunning art the nigger of the other, They muddle and confuse the two, they mix, and twist and mingle, So that it takes a cunning view to make out either single. The Soul gets mingled with the Flesh beyond all separation, The Body holds it in a mesh of animal sensation; The poor bewilder'd Being, grown a thing in nature double, Half light and soul, half flesh and bone, is given up to trouble. He thinks the instinct of the clay the glowings of the Spirit, And when the Spirit has her say, inclines the Flesh to hear it. The slave of every passing whim, the dupe of every devil, Inspired by every female limb to love, and light, and revel, Impulsive, timid, weak, or strong, as Flesh or Spirit makes him, The lost one wildly moans along till mischief overtakes him; And when the Soul has fed upon the Flesh till life's spring passes, Finds strength and health and comfort gone—the way of last year's grasses, And the poor Soul is doom'd to bow, in deep humiliation, Within a place that isn't now a decent habitation. No! keep the Soul and Flesh apart in pious resolution, Don't let weak flutterings of the heart lead you to my confusion! But let the Flesh be as the horse, the Spirit as the rider, And use the snaffle first of course, and ease her up and guide her; And if she's going to resist, and won't let none go past her, Just take the curb and give a twist, and show her you're the Master. The Flesh is but a temporal thing, and Satan's strength is in it, Use it, but conquer it, and bring its vice down every minute! Into a woman's arms don't fall, as if you meant to stay there, Just come as if you'd made a call, and idly found your way there; Don't praise her too much to her face, but keep her calm and quiet,— Most female illnesses take place thro' far too warm a diet; Unto her give your fleshly kiss, calm, kind, and patronising, Then—soar to your own sphere of bliss, before her heart gets rising! Don't fail to let her see full clear, how in your saintly station The Flesh is but your nigger here obeying your dictation; And tho' the Flesh be e'er so warm, your Soul the weakness smothers Of loving any female form much better than the others! O Brigham, I can see you smile to hear the Devil preaching;— Well, I can praise your perfect style, tho' far beyond my reaching. Forgive me, if in shame and grief I vex you with digression, And let me come again in brief to my own dark confession. The world of men divided is into two portions, brother, The first are Saints, so high in bliss that they the Flesh can smother; God meant them from fair flower to flower to flutter, smiles bestowing, Tasting the sweet, leaving the sour, just hovering,—and going. The second are a different set, just halves of perfect spirits, Going about in bitter fret, of uncompleted merits, Till they discover, here or there, their other half (or woman), Then these two join, and make a Pair, and so increase the human. The second Souls inferior are, a lower spirit-order, Born 'neath a less auspicious star, and taken by soft sawder;— And if they do not happen here to find their fair Affinity, They come to grief and doubt and fear, and end in asininity; And if they try the blessed game of those superior to them, They're very quickly brought to shame,— their passions so undo them. In some diviner sphere, perhaps, they'll look and grow more holy,— Meantime they're vessels Sorrow taps and grim Remorse sucks slowly. Now, Brigham, I was made, you see, one of those lower creatures, Polygamy was not for me, altho' I joined its preachers. Instead of, with a wary eye, seeking the one who waited, And sticking to her, wet or dry, because the thing was fated, I snatch'd the first whose beauty stirred my soul with tender feeling! And then another! then a third! and so continued Sealing! And duly, after many a smart, discovered, sighing faintly, I hadn't found my missing part, and wasn't strong and saintly! O they were far too good for me, altho' their zeal betrayed them;— Unfortunately, don't you see, heaven for some other made them: Each would a downright blessing be, and Peace would pitch the tent for her, If ‘she’ could only find the ‘he’ originally meant for her! Well, Brother, after many years of bad domestic diet, One morning I woke up in tears, still weary and unquiet, And (speaking figuratively) lo! beside my bed stood smiling The Woman, young and virgin snow, but beckoning and beguiling. I started up, my wild eyes rolled, I knew her, and stood sighing, My thoughts throng'd up like bees of gold out of the smithy flying. And as she stood in brightness there, familiar, tho' a stranger, I looked at her in dumb despair, and trembled at the danger. But, Brother Brigham, don't you think the Devil could so undo me, That straight I rushed the cup to drink too late extended to me. No, for I hesitated long, ev'n when I found she loved me, And didn't seem to think it wrong when love and passion moved me. O Brigham, you're a Saint above, and know not the sensation The ecstasy, the maddening love, the rapturous exultation, That fills a man of lower race with wonder past all speaking, When first he finds in one sweet face the Soul he has been seeking! When two immortal beings glow in the first fond revealing, And their inferior natures know the luxury of feeling! But ah, I had already got a quiver-full of blessing, Had blundered, tho' I knew it not, six times beyond redressing, And surely it was time to stop, tho' still my lot was lonely: My house was like a cobbler's shop, full, tho' with ‘misfits’ only. And so I should have stopt, I swear, the wretchedest of creatures, Rather than put one mark of care on her belovèd features: But that it happen'd Sister Anne (ah, now the secret's flitted!) Was left in this great world of man unto my care committed. Her father, Jason Jones, was dead, a man whose faults were many, ‘O, be a father, Abe,’ he said, ‘to my poor daughter Annie!’ And so I promised, so she came an Orphan to this city, And set my foolish heart in flame with mingled love and pity; And as she prettier grew each day, and throve 'neath my protection, I saw the Saints did cast her way some tokens of affection. O, Brigham, pray forgive me now;—envy and love combining, I hated every saintly brow, benignantly inclining! Sneered at their motives, mocked the cause, went wild and sorrow-laden, And saw Polygamy's vast jaws a-yawning for the maiden. Why not, you say? Ah, yes, why not, from your high point of vision; But I'm of an inferior lot, beyond the light Elysian. I tore my hair, whined like a whelp, I loved her to distraction, I saw the danger, knew the help, yet trembled at the action. At last I came to you, my friend, and told my tender feeling; You said, ‘Your grief shall have an end—this is a case for Sealing; And since you have deserved so well, and made no heinous blunder, Why, brother Abraham, take the gel, but mind you keep her under.’ Well! then I went to Sister Anne, my inmost heart unclothing, Told her my feelings like a man, concealing next to nothing, Explain'd the various characters of those I had already, The various tricks and freaks and stirs peculiar to each lady, And, finally, when all was clear, and hope seem'd to forsake me, ‘There! it's a wretched chance, my dear—you leave me, or you take me.’ Well, Sister Annie look'd at me, her inmost heart revealing (Women are very weak, you see, inferior, full of feeling), Then, thro' her tears outshining bright, ‘I'll never, never leave you! ‘O Abe,’ she said, ‘my love, my light, why should I pain or grieve you? I do not love the way of life you have so sadly chosen, I'd rather be a single wife than one in half a dozen; But now you cannot change your plan, tho' health and spirit perish, And I shall never see a man but you to love and cherish. Take me, I'm yours, and O, my dear, don't think I miss your merit, I'll try to help a little here your true and loving spirit.’ ‘Reflect, my love,’ I said, ‘once more,’ with bursting heart, half crying, 'Two of the girls cut very sore, and most of them are trying!’ And then that gentle-hearted maid kissed me and bent above me, ‘O Abe,’ she said, ‘don't be afraid,—I'll try to make them love me!’ Ah well! I scarcely stopt to ask myself, till all was over, How precious tough would be her task who made those dear souls love her! But I was seal'd to Sister Anne, and straight-way, to my wonder, A series of events began which show'd me all my blunder. Brother, don't blame the souls who erred thro' their excess of feeling— So angrily their hearts were stirred by my last act of sealing; But in a moment they forgot the quarrels they'd been wrapt in, And leagued together in one lot, with Tabby for the Captain. Their little tiffs were laid aside, and all combined together, Preparing for the gentle Bride the blackest sort of weather. It wasn't feeling made them flout poor Annie in that fashion, It wasn't love turn'd inside out, it wasn't jealous passion, It wasn't that they cared for me, or any other party, Their hearts and sentiments were free, their appetites were hearty. But when the pretty smiling face came blossoming and blooming, Like sunshine in a shady place the fam'ly Vault illuming, It naturally made them grim to see its sunny colour, While like a row of tapers dim by daylight, they grew duller. She tried her best to make them kind, she coaxed and served them dumbly, She watch'd them with a willing mind, deferred to them most humbly; Tried hard to pick herself a friend, but found her arts rejected, And fail'd entirely in her end, as one might have expected, But, Brother, tho' I'm loth to add one word to criminate them, I think their conduct was too bad,—it almost made me hate them. Ah me, the many nagging ways of women are amazing, Their cleverness solicits praise, their cruelty is crazing! And Sister Annie hadn't been a single day their neighbour, Before a baby could have seen her life would be a labour, But bless her little loving heart, it kept its sorrow hidden, And if the tears began to start, suppressed the same unbidden. She tried to smile, and smiled her best, till I thought sorrow silly, And kept in her own garden nest, and lit it like a lily. O I should waste your time for days with talk like this at present, If I described her thousand ways of making things look pleasant! But, bless you, 'twere as well to try, when thunder's at its dire work, To clear the air, and light the sky, by pennyworths of firework. These gentle ways to hide her woe and make my life a blessing, Just made the after darkness grow more gloomy and depressing. Taunts, mocks, and jeers, coldness and sneers, insult and trouble daily, A thousand stabs that brought the tears, all these she cover'd gaily; But when her fond eyes fell on me, the light of love to borrow, And Sister Anne began to see I knew her secret sorrow, All of a sudden like a mask the loving cheat forsook her, And reckon I had all my task, for illness overtook her. She took to bed, grew sad and thin, seem'd like a spirit flying, Smiled thro' her tears when I went in, but when I left fell crying; And as she languish'd in her bed, as weak and wan as water, I thought of what her father said, ‘Take care of my dear daughter!’ Then I look'd round with secret eye upon her many Sisters, And close at hand I saw them lie, ready for use—like blisters; They seemed with secret looks of glee, to keep their wifely station; They set their lips and sneer'd at me, and watch'd the situation. O Brother, I can scarce express the agony of those moments, I fear your perfect saintliness, and dread your cutting comments! I prayed, I wept, I moan'd, I cried, I anguish'd night and morrow, I watch'd and waited, sleepless-eyed, beside that bed of sorrow. At last I knew, in those dark days of sorrow and disaster, Mine wasn't soil where you could raise a Saint up, or a Pastor; In spite of careful watering, and tilling night and morning, The weeds of vanity would spring without a word of warning. I was and ever must subsist, labell'd on every feature, A wretched poor Monogamist, a most inferior creature— Just half a soul, and half a mind, a blunder and abortion, Not finish'd half till I could find the other missing portion! And gazing on that missing part which I at last had found out, I murmur'd with a burning heart, scarce strong to get the sound out, ‘If from the greedy clutch of Fate I save this chief of treasures, I will no longer hesitate, but take decided measures! A poor monogamist like me can not love half a dozen, Better by far, then, set them free, and take the Wife I've chosen! Their love for me, of course, is small, a very shadowy tittle, They will not miss my face at all, or miss it very little. I can't undo what I have done, by my forlorn embraces, And call the brightness of the sun again into their faces; But I can save one spirit true, confiding and unthinking, From slowly curdling to a shrew or into swinedom sinking.’ These were my bitter words of woe, my fears were so distressing, Not that I would reflect—O no !—on any living blessing. Thus, Brother, I resolved, and when she rose, still frail and sighing, I kept my word like better men, and bolted, —and I'm flying. Into oblivion I haste, and leave the world behind me, Afar unto the starless waste, where not a soul shall find me. I send my love, and Sister Anne joins cordially, agreeing I never was the sort of man for your high state of being; Such as I am, she takes me, though; and after years of trying, From Eden hand in hand we go, like our first parents flying; And like the bright sword that did chase the first of sires and mothers, Shines dear Tabitha's flaming face, surrounded by the others: Shining it threatens there on high, above the gates of Heaven, And faster at the sight we fly, in naked shame, forth-driven. Nothing of all my worldly store I take, 'twould be improper, I go a pilgrim, strong and poor, without a single copper. Unto my Widows I outreach my property completely. There's modest competence for each, if it is managed neatly. That, Brother, is a labour left to your sagacious keeping;— Comfort them, comfort the bereft! I'm good as dead and sleeping! A fallen star, a shooting light, a portent and an omen, A moment passing on the sight, thereafter seen by no men! I go, with backward-looking face, and spirit rent asunder. O may you prosper in your place, for you're a shining wonder! So strong, so sweet, so mild, so good!—by Heaven's dispensation, Made Husband to a multitude and Father to a nation! May all the saintly life ensures increase and make you stronger! Humbly and penitently yours, A. Clewson (Saint no longer) THE FARM IN THE VALLEY—SUNSET. (1871.) Still the saintly City stands, Wondrous work of busy hands; Still the lonely City thrives, Rich in worldly goods and wives, And with thrust-out jaw and set Teeth, the Yankee threatens yet— Half admiring and half riled, Oft by bigger schemes beguiled, Turning off his curious stare To communities elsewhere, Always with unquiet eye Watching Utah on the sly. Long the City of the Plain Left its image on my brain: White kiosks and gardens bright Rising in a golden light; Busy figures everywhere Bustling bee-like in the glare; And from dovecotes in green places, Peep'd out weary women's faces, Flushing faint to a thin cry From the nursery hard by. And the City in my thought Slept fantastically wrought, Till the whole began to seem Like a curious Eastern dream, Like the pictures strange we scan In the tales Arabian: Tales of magic art and sleight, Cities rising in a night, And of women richly clad, Dark-eyed, melancholy, sad, Ever with a glance uncertain, Trembling at the purple curtain, Lest behind the black slave stand With the bowstring in his hand;— Happy tales, within whose heart Founts of weeping eyes upstart, Told, to save her pretty head, By Scheherazad in bed! All had faded and grown faint, Save the figure of the Saint Who that memorable night Left the Children of the Light, Flying o'er the lonely plain From his lofty sphere of pain Oft his gentle face would flit O'er my mind and puzzle it, Ever waking up meanwhile Something of a merry smile, Whose quick light illumined me During many a reverie, When I puffed my weed alone. Faint and strange the face had grown, Tho' for five long years or so I had watched it come and go, When, on busy thoughts intent, I into New England went, And one evening, riding slow By a River that I know, (Gentle stream! I hide thy name, Far too modest thou for fame!) I beheld the landscape swim In the autumn hazes dim, And from out the neighbouring dales Heard the thumping of the flails. All was hush'd; afar away (As a novelist would say) Sank the mighty orb of day, Staring with a hazy glow On the purple plain below, Where (like burning embers shed From the sunset's glowing bed, Dying out or burning bright, Every leaf a blaze of light) Ran the maple swamps ablaze; Everywhere amid the haze, Floating strangely in the air, Farms and homesteads gather'd fair; And the River rippled slow, Thro' the marshes green and low, Spreading oft as smooth as glass As it fringed the meadow grass, Making 'mong the misty fields Pools like golden gleaming shields. Thus I walked my steed along, Humming a low scrap of song, Watching with an idle eye White clouds in the dreamy sky Sailing with me in slow pomp. In the bright flush of the swamp, While his dogs bark'd in the wood, Gun in hand the sportsman stood; And beside me, wading deep, Stood the angler half asleep, Figure black against the gleam Of the bright pools of the stream; Now and then a wherry brown With the current drifted down Sunset-ward, and as it went, Made an oar-splash indolent; While with solitary sound, Deepening the silence round, In a voice of mystery Faintly cried the chickadee. Suddenly the River's arm Rounded, and a lonely Farm Stood before me blazing red To the bright blaze overhead; In the homesteads at its side, Cattle lowed and voices cried, And fron out the shadows dark Came a mastiff's measured bark. Fair and fat stood the abode On the path by which I rode, And a mighty orchard, strown Still with apple-leaves wind-blown, Raised its branches gnarl'd and bare Black against the sunset air, And with greensward deep and dim, Wander'd to the River's brim. Close beside the orchard walk Linger'd one in quiet talk With a man in workman's gear. As my horse's feet drew near, The labourer nodded rough ‘good-day, Turned his back and loung'd away. Then the first, a plump and fat Yeoman in a broad straw hat, Stood alone in thought intent, Watching while the other went, And amid the sunlight red Paused, with hand held to his head. In a moment, like a word Long forgotten until heard, Like a buried sentiment Born again to some stray scent, Like a sound to which the brain Gives familiar refrain, Something in the gesture brought Things forgotten to my thought; Memory, as I watched the sight, Flashed from eager light to light. Remember'd and remember'd not, Half familiar, half forgot, Stood the figure, till at last, Bending eyes on his, I passed, Gazed again, as loth to go, Drew the rein, stopt short, and so Rested, looking back; when he, The object of my scrutiny, Smiled and nodded, saying, ‘Yes! Stare your fill, young man! I guess You'll know me if we meet again!’ In a moment all my brain Was illumined at the tone, All was vivid that had grown Faint and dim, and straight I knew him, Holding out my hand unto him, Smiled, and called him by his name. Wondering, hearing me exclaim, Abraham Clewson (for 'twas he) Came more close and gazed at me. As he gazed, a merry grin Brighten'd down from eyes to chin: In a moment he, too, knew me, Reaching out his hand unto me, Crying ‘Track'd, by all that's blue! Who'd have thought of seeing you?’ Then, in double quicker time Than it takes to make the rhyme, Abe, with face of welcome bright, Made me from my steed alight; Call'd a boy, and bade him lead The beast away to bed and feed; And, with hand upon my arm, Led me off into the Farm, Where, amid a dwelling-place Fresh and bright as her own face, With a gleam of shining ware For a background everywhere, Free as any summer breeze, With a bunch of huswife's keys At her girdle, sweet and mild Sister Annie blush'd and smiled,— While two tiny laughing girls, Peeping at me through their curls, Hid their sweet shamefacëdness In the skirts of Annie's dress. That same night the Saint and I Sat and talked of times gone by, Smoked our pipes and drank our grog By the slowly smouldering log, While the clock's hand slowly crept To midnight, and the household slept. ‘Happy?’ Abe said with a smile, ‘Yes, in my inferior style, Meek and humble, not like them In the New Jerusalem.’ Here his hand, as if astray, For a moment found its way To his forehead, as he said, ‘Reckon they believe I'm dead! Ah, that life of sanctity Never was the life for me. Couldn't stand it wet nor dry, Hated to see women cry; Couldn't bear to be the cause Of tiffs and squalls and endless jaws; Always felt amid the stir Jest a whited sepulchre; And I did the best I could When I ran away for good. Yet, for many a night, you know (Annie, too, would tell you so), Couldn't sleep a single wink, Couldn't eat, and couldn't drink, Being kind of conscience-cleft For those poor creatures I had left. Not till I got news from there, And I found their fate was fair, Could I set to work, or find Any comfort in my mind. Well (here Abe smiled quietly), Guess they didn't groan for me! Fanny and Amelia got Sealed to Brigham on the spot; Emmy soon consoled herself In the arms of Brother Delf; And poor Mary one fine day Packed her traps and tript away Down to Fresco with Fred Bates, A young player from the States; While Sarah, 'twas the wisest plan, Pick'd herself a single man— A young joiner fresh come down Out of Texas to the town— And he took her with her baby, And they're doing well as maybe.’ Here the Saint with quiet smile, Sipping at his grog the while, Paused as if his tale was o'er, Held his tongue and said no more. ‘Good,’ I said, ‘but have you done? You have spoke of all save one— All your Widows, so bereft, Are most comfortably left, But of one alone you said Nothing. Is the lady dead?’ Then the good man's features broke Into brightness as I spoke, And with loud guffaw cried he, ‘What, Tabitha? Dead! Not she. All alone and doing splendid— Jest you guess, now, how she's ended! Give it up? This very week I heard she's at Oneida Creek, All alone and doing hearty, Down with Brother Noyes's party Tried the Shakers first, they say, Tired of them and went away, Testing with a deal of bother This community and t'other, Till she to Oneida flitted, And with trouble got admitted. Bless you, she's a shining lamp, Tho' I used her like a scamp, And she's great in exposition Of the Free Love folk's condition, Vowing, tho' she found it late, 'Tis the only happy state. . . . ‘As for me,’ added the speaker, ‘I'm lower in the scale, and weaker; Polygamy's beyond my merits, Shakerism wears the spirits, And as for Free Love, why you see (Here the Saint wink'd wickedly) With my whim it might have hung Once, when I was spry and young; But poor Annie's love alone Keeps my mind in proper tone, And tho' my spirit mayn't be strong. I'm lively—as the day is long.’ As he spoke, with half a yawn, Half a smile, I saw the dawn Creeping faint into the gloom Of the quickly-chilling room. On the hearth the wood-log lay, With one last expiring ray; Draining off his glass of grog, Clewson rose and kick'd the log; As it tumbled into ashes, Watched the last expiring flashes, Gave another yawn and said, ‘Well! I guess it's time for bed!’ White Rose and Red. A LOVE STORY. DEDICATION. To Walt Whitman and Alexander Gardiner, with all friends in Washington, I dedicate this Poem. INVOCATION. ‘KNOW'ST THOU THE LAND?’ I Know'st thou the Land, where the lian-flower Burgeons the trapper's forest bower, Where o'er his head the acacia sweet Shaketh her scented locks in the heat, Where the hang-bird swings to a blossom-cloud, And the bobolink sings merry and loud? Know'st thou the Land? O there! O there, Might I with thee, O friend of my heart, repair! II Know'st thou the Land where the golden Day Flowers into glory and glows away, While the Night springs up, as an Indian girl Clad in purple and hung with pearl! And the white Moon's heaven rolls apart, Like a bell-shaped flower with a golden heart,— Know'st thou the Land? O there! O there, Might I with thee, O Maid of my Soul, repair! III Know'st thou the Land where the woods are free, And the prairie rolls as a mighty sea, And over its waves the sunbeams shine, While on its misty horizon-line Dark and dim the buffaloes stand, And the hunter is gliding gun in hand? Know'st thou it well? O there! O there, Might I, with those whose Souls are free, repair! IV Know'st thou the Land where the sun-birds song Filleth the forest all day long, Where all is music and mirth and bloom, Where the cedar sprinkles a soft perfume, Where life is gay as a glancing stream, And all things answer the Poet's dream? Know'st thou the Land? O there! O there, Might I, with him who loves my lays, repair! V Know'st thou the Land where the swampy brakes Are full of the nests of the rattlesnakes, Where round old Grizzly the wild bees hum, While squatting he sucks at their honeycomb, Where crocodiles crouch and the wild cat springs, And the mildest ills are mosquito stings? Know'st thou the Land? O there! O there, Might I, with adverse Critics, straight repair! VI Know'st thou the Land where wind and sun Smile on all races of men—save one: Where (strange and wild as a sunset proud Streak'd with the bars of a thunder-cloud) Alone and silent the Red Man lies, Sees the cold stars coming, and sinks, and dies? Know'st thou the Land? O there! O there, Might I to wet his poor parch'd lips repair! VII Lock up thy gold, and take thy flight To the mighty Land of the red and white; A ditty I love I would have thee hear, While daylight dies, and the Night comes near With her black feet wet from the western sea, And the Red Man dies, with his eyes on thee! Fast to that Land, ere his last footprints there Are beaten down by alien feet, repair! PART I. THE CAPTURE OF EUREKA HART. I. Natura Naturans. Dawn breaking. Thro' his dew-veil smiles the sun, And under him doth run On the green grass and in the forest brake Bright beast and speckled snake; Birds on the bough and insects in the ray Gladden; and it is day. What is this lying on the thymy steep, Where yellow bees hum deep, And the rich air is warm as living breath? What soft shape slumbereth Naked and dark, and glows in a green nest, Low-breathing in bright rest? Is it the spotted panther, lying there Lissome and light and fair? Is it the snake, with glittering skin coil'd round And gleaming on the ground? Is it some wondrous bird whose eyrie lies Between the earth and skies? 'Tis none of these, but something stranger far— Strange as a fallen star! A mortal birth, a marvel heavenly-eyed, With dark pink breast and side! And as she lies the wild deer comes most meek To smell her scented cheek, And creeps away; the yeanling ounce lies near, And watches with no fear; The serpent rustles past, with touch as light As rose-leaves, rippling bright Into the grass beyond; while yonder, on high, A black speck in the sky, The crested eagle hovers, with sharp sight Facing the flood of light. What living shape is this who sleeping lies Watch'd by all wondering eyes Of beast and speckled snake and flying bird? Softly she sleeps, unstirr'd By wind or sun; and since she first fell there Her raven locks of hair Have loosen'd, shaken round her in a shower, Whence, like a poppy flower With dark leaves and a tongue to brightness tipt, She lies vermilion-lipt. Bare to the waist, her head upon her arm, Coil'd on a couch most warm Of balsam and of hemlock, whose soft scent With her warm breath is blent. Around her brow a circlet of pure gold, With antique letters scroll'd, Burns in the sun-ray, and with gold also Her wrists and ankles glow. Around her neck the threaded wild cat's teeth Hang white as pearl; beneath Her bosoms heave, and in the space between, Duskly tattoo'd, is seen A figure small as of a pine-bark brand Held blazing in a hand. Her skirt of azure, wrought with braid and thread In quaint signs yellow and red, Scarce reaches to her dark and dimpled knee, Leaving it bare and free. Below, mocassins red as blood are wound, With gold and purple bound;— So that red-footed like the stork she lies, With softly shrouded eyes, Whose brightness seems with heavy lustrous dew To pierce the dark lids thro'. Her eyelids closed, her poppied lips apart, And her quick eager heart Stirring her warm frame, as a bird unseen Stirs the warm lilac-sheen, She slumbers,—and of all beneath the skies Seemeth the last to rise. She stirs—she wakens—now, O birds, sing loud Under the golden cloud! She stirs—she wakens—now, O wild beast, spring, Blooms grow, breeze blow, birds sing! She wakens in her nest and looks around, And listens to the sound; Her eyelids blink against the heavens' bright beam, Still dim and dark with dream, Her breathing quickens, and her cheek gleams red, And round her shining head Glossy her black hair glistens. Now she stands, And with her little hands Shades her soft orbs and upward at the sky She gazeth quietly; Then at one bound springs with a sudden song The forest-track along. Thro' the transparent roof of twining leaves, Where the deep sunlight weaves Threads like a spider's-web of silvern white, Faint falls the dreamy light Down the gray bolls and boughs that intervene, On to the carpet green Prinkt with all wondrous flowers, on emerald brakes Where the still speckled snakes Crawl shaded; and above the shaded ground, Amid the deep-sea sound Of the high branches, bright birds scream and fly And chattering parrots cry; And everywhere beneath them in the bowers Float things like living flowers, Hovering and settling; and here and there The blue gleams deep and fair Thro' the high parted boughs, while serpent-bright Slips thro' the golden light, Startling the cool deep shades that brood around, And floating to the ground, With multitudinous living motes at play Like dust in the rich ray. Hither for shelter from the burning sun Hath stolen the beauteous one, And thro' the ferns and flowers she runs, and plucks Berries blue-black, and sucks The fallen orange. Where the sunbeams blink She lieth down to drink Out of the deep pool, and her image sweet Floats dim below her feet, Up-peering thro' the lilies yellow and white And green leaves where the bright Great Dragon-fly doth pause. With burning breath She looks and gladdeneth. She holds her hands, the shape holds out hands too; She stoops more near to view, And it too stoopeth looking wild and sly; Whereat, with merry cry, She staretth up, and fluttering onward flies With gladness in her eyes. But who is this who all alone lies deep In heavy-lidded sleep? A dark smile hovering on his bearded lips, His hunter's gun he grips, And snores aloud where snakes and lizards run, His mighty limbs i' the sun And his fair face within the shadow. See! His breath comes heavily Like one's tired out with toil; and when in fear The Indian maid comes near, And bendeth over him most wondering, The bright birds scream and sing, The motes are madder in the ray, the snake Glides luminous in the brake, The sunlight flashes fiery overhead, The wood-cat with eyes red Crawleth close by, with her lithe crimson tongue Licking her clumsy young, And, deep within the open prairie nigh, Hawks swoop and struck birds cry! Dark maiden, what is he thou lookest on? O ask not, but begone! Go! for his eyes are blue, his skin is white, And giant-like his height. To him thou wouldst appear a tiny thing, Some small bird on the wing, Some small deer to be kill'd ere it could fly, Or to be tamed, and die!— O look not, look not, in the hunter's face, Thou maid of the red race, He is a tame thing, thou art weak and wild, Thou lovely forest-child! How should the deer by the great deerhound walk, The wood-dove seek the hawk?— Away! away! lest he should wake from rest, Fly, sun-bird, to thy nest! Why doth she start, and backward softly creep? He stirreth in his sleep— Why doth she steal away with wondering eyes? He stretches limbs, and sighs. Peace! she hath fled—and he is all alone, While, with a yawn and groan, The man sits up, rubs eyelids, grips his gun, Stares heavenward at the sun, And cries aloud, stretching himself anew: ‘Broad day,—by all that's blue!’ II. Eureka. On the shores of the Atlantic, Where the surge rolls fierce and frantic, Where the mad winds cry and wrestle With each frail and bird-like vessel,— Down in Maine, where human creatures Are amphibious in their natures, And the babies, sons or daughters, Float like fishes in the waters,— Down in Maine, by the Atlantic, Grew the Harts, of race gigantic, And the tallest and the strongest Was Eureka Hart, the youngest. Like a bear-cub as a baby, Rough, and rear'd as roughly as may be, He had rudely grown and thriven Till, a giant, six foot seven, Bold and ready for all comers, He had reach'd full thirty summers. All his brethren, thrifty farmers, Had espoused their rural charmers, Settling down once and for ever By the Muskeosquash River: Thrifty men, devout believers, Of the tribe of human beavers; Life to them, with years increasing, Was an instinct never-ceasing To build dwellings multifarious In the fashion called gregarious, To be honest in their station, And increase the population Of the beavers! They, moreover, Tho' their days were cast in clover, Had the instinct of secreting; Toiling hard while time was fleeting, To lay by in secret places, [Like the bee and squirrel races,] Quiet stores of yellow money, [Which is human nuts and honey.] Tho' no flowers of dazzling beauty In their ploughshare line of duty Rose and bloom'd, still, rural daisies, Such as every village raises, From the thin soil of their spirits Grew and throve. Their gentle merits, Free of any gleam of passion, Flower'd in an instructive fashion. Quite convinced that life was fleeting Every week they went to meeting, Met and prayed to God in dozens, Uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, Joining there in adoration, All the beaver population! From this family one creature, Taller and more fair of feature, Err'd and wander'd, slightly lacking In the building, breeding, packing, Tribal-instinct; and would never Settle down by wood or river, Build a house or take a woman In the pleasant fashion common To his race; evincing rather Traces of some fiercer father, Panther-like, to hunting given In the eye of the bluc heaven! When beneath the mother's bosom His great life began to blossom, Haply round her winds were crying, O'er her head the white clouds flying, At her feet the wild waves flowing, All things moving, coming, going, And the motion and vibration Reach'd the thing in embryoation, On its unborn soul conferring Endless impulse to be stirring,— To be ever wandering, racing, Bird-like, wave-like, chased or chasing! Born beside the stormy ocean, 'Twas the giant's earliest notion To go roaming on the billow, With a damp plank for a pillow. In his youth he went as sailor With the skipper of a whaler; But in later life he better Loved to feel no sort of fetter, All his own free pathway mapping In the forest,—hunting, trapping. By great rivers, thro' vast valleys, As thro' some enchanted palace Ever bright and ever changing, Many years he went a-ranging,— Free as any wave, and only Lonely as a cloud is lonely, Floating in a void, surveying Endless tracts for endless straying. Pause a minute and regard him! Years of hardships have not marr'd him. Limbs made perfect, iron-solder'd, Narrow-hipp'd and mighty-shoulder'd, Whisker'd, bearded, strong and stately, With a smile that lurks sedately In still eyes of a cold azure, Never lighting to sheer pleasure, Stands he there, 'mid the green trees Like the Greek god, Herakles. Stay, nor let the bright allusion Lead your spirit to confusion. Tho' a wanderer, and a creature Almost as a god in feature, This man's nature was as surely Soulless and instinctive purely, As the natures of those others, His sedater beaver-brothers; Nothing brilliant, bright, or frantic, Nothing maidens style romantic, Flash'd his slow brain morn or night Into spiritual light! As waves run, and as clouds wander, With small power to feel or ponder, Roam'd this thing in human clothing, Intellectually—nothing! Further in his soul receding, Certain signs of beaver-breeding Kept his homely wits in see-saw; Part was Jacob, part was Esau; No revolter; a believer In the dull creed of the beaver; Strictly moral; seeing beauty In the ploughshare line of duty; Loving nature as beasts love it, Eating, drinking, tasting of it, With no wild poetic gleaming, Seldom shaping, never dreaming; Beaver with a wandering craze, Walked Eureka in God's ways. Now ye know him, now ye see him; Nought from beaver-blood can free him Yet stand by and shrewdly con him, While a wild light strikes upon him, While a gleam of glory finds him, Flashes in his eyes and blinds him, Shapes his mind to its full measure, Raising him, in one mad pleasure, 'Spite the duller brain's control, To the stature of a Soul! III. The Capture. The wild wood rings, the wild wood gleams, The wild wood laughs with echoes gay; Thro' its green heart a bright beck streams, Sparkling like gold in the sun's beams, But creeping, like a silvern ray, Where hanging boughs make dim the day. Hush'd, hot, and Eden-like all seems, And onward thro' the place of dreams Eureka Hart doth stray. Strong, broad-awake, and happy-eyed, With the loose tangled light for guide, He wanders, and at times doth pass Thro' open glades of gleaming grass, With spiderwort and larkspur spread, And great anemones blood-red; On every side the forest closes, The myriad trees are interlaced, Starr'd with the white magnolia roses, And by the purple vines embraced. Beneath on every pathway shine The fallen needles of the pine; Around are dusky scented bowers, Bridged with the glorious lian-flowers. Above, far up thro' the green trees, The palm thrusts out its fan of green, Which softly stirs in a soft breeze, Far up against the heavenly sheen. And all beneath the topmost palm Is sultry shade and air of balm, Where, shaded from the burning rays, Scream choirs of parroquets and jays; Where in the dusk of dream is heard The shrill cry of the echo-bird; And on the grass, as thick as bees, Run mocking-birds and wood-doves small Pecking the blood-red strawberries, And fruits that from the branches fall; All rising up with gleam and cry, When the bright snake glides hissing by, Springs from the grass, and, swift as light, Slips after the chameleons bright From bough to bough, and here and there Pauses and hangs in the green air, Festoon'd in many a glistening fold, Like some loose chain of gems and gold. Smoke from a mortal pipe is blent With cedar and acacia scent: Phlegmatically relishing, Eureka smokes; from every tree The wood-doves brood, the sun-birds sing, The forest doth salute its King, The monarch Man,—but what cares he? His eyes are dull, his soul in vain Hears the strange tongues of his domain, No echo comes to the soft strain From the dull cavern of his brain. But hark! what quick and sparkling cry Darts like a fountain to the sky? How, human voices! strangely clear, They burst upon the wanderer's ear. He stops, he listens—hark again, Wild rippling laughter rises plain! O'er his fair face a look of wonder Is spreading—‘Injins here—by thunder!’ He cocks his gun, and stands to hear, Sets his white teeth together tight, Then, silent-footed as the deer, Creeps to the sound. The branches bright Thicken around him; with quick flight The doves and blue-birds gleam away, Shooting in showers from spray to spray. A thicket of a thousand blooms, Green, rose, white, blue, one rainbow glow, Closes around him; strange perfumes, Crush'd underfoot in the rich glooms, Load the rich air as he doth go; The harmless snakes around him glow With emerald eyes; lithe arms of vine Trip him and round his neck entwine, Bursting against his stained skin Their grapes of purple glossy-thin. But still the rippling laughter flows Before him as he creeps and goes, Till suddenly, with a strange look, He crouches down in a green nook, Crouches and gazes from the bowers, Curtain'd and cover'd up in flowers. O, what strange sight before him lies? Why doth he gaze with sparkling eyes And beating heart? Deep, bright, and cool, Before him gleams a crystal pool, Fed by the beck: and o'er its brim Festoons of roses mirror'd dim Hang drooping low on every side; And glorious moths and dragon-flies Hover above, and gleaming-eyed The stingless snake hangs blossom-wise, In loose folds sleeping. Not on these Gazes Eureka thro' the trees: Snake never made such smiles to grace His still blue eyes and sun-tann'd face, And never flower, howe'er so fair, Would fix that face to such a stare. And yet like gleaming water-snakes They wind and wanton in the pool. Above their waists in flickering flakes The molten sunlight slips and shakes; Beneath, their gleaming limbs bathe cool. One floats above with laughter sweet, And splashes silver with her feet; One clinging to the drooping boughs Leans back, and lets her silken hair Rain backward from her rippling brows, While on her shoulders dark and bare Blossoms fall thick and linger there Nestling and clinging. To the throat Cover'd, one dark-eyed thing doth float, Her face a flower, her locks all wet, Tendrils and leaves around it set; O sight most strangely beautiful, Three Indian Naïads in a pool! Eureka, be it understood, Though beaver-born, is flesh and blood, And what he saw in day's broad gold Was stranger far a thousand fold, Than that wild scene bold Tam O'Shanter In Scotland saw one winter night, (Ah with the Scottish Bard to canter, On Pegasus to Fame instanter, Singing one song so trim and tight!) He look'd, and look'd, like Tam; like him. On the most fair of face and limb Fixing most long his wondering eye; For I like greater bards should lie, If I averr'd that all and one Who sported there beneath the sun, Were gloriously fair of face; But they were women of red race, Clad in the most bewitching dress, Their own unconscious loveliness; And tho' their beauty might not be Perfect and flawless, they were fine, Bright-eyed, red-lipp'd, made strong and free In many a cunning curve and line A sculptor would have deem'd divine. Not so the rest, who all around With fierce eyes squatted on the ground, Nodding approval:—squaws and crones Clapping their hands with eager groans. These were the witches, I might say, Of this new tropic Alloway. [As for the Devil—even he Was by the Serpent represented Swinging asleep from a green tree,— Reflected, gloriously painted, In the bright water where the three Laugh'd and disported merrily.] But chiefly poor Eureka gazed, Trembling, dumb-stricken, and amazed, On the most beautiful of all, Who standing on the water-side, A perfect shape queenly and tall Stood in the sun erect, and dried Her gleaming body head to feet In one broad ray of golden heat. Naked she stood, but her strange sheen Of beauty clad her like a queen, And beaming rings of yellow gold Were round her wrists and ankles roll'd, And on her skin Eureka scann'd A symbol bright as of a brand Held burning in a human hand. Smiling, she spake in a strange tongue, And eager laughter round her rung, While wading out all lustrous-eyed She sat upon the water-side, And pelted merrily the rest With blossoms bright and flowers of jest. Ah, little did Eureka guess, While wondering at her loveliness, The same fair form had softly crept And look'd upon him while he slept, And thought him (him! the man of Maine! Civilizee with beaver-brain!) Beauteous, in passion's first wild beam, Beyond all Indian guess or dream! Eureka Hart, though tempted more Than e'er was mortal man before, Did not like Tam O'Shanter break The charm with mad applause or call; Too wise for such a boor's mistake, He held his tongue, observing all; But while the hunter forward leant, Sharing the glorious merriment, He moved a little unaware The better to behold the sport, And lo! upon the heavy air Off went his gun with sharp report, And while the bullet past his ear Whizz'd quick, he stagger'd with the shock, And with one scream distinct and clear Rose the red women in a flock. The naked bathers stood and scream'd, The brown squaws cried, their white teeth gleam'd; And ere he knew, with startled face He stagger'd to the open space; The sharp vines tript him, and, confounded, He stumbled, grasping still his gun,— And, by the chattering choir surrounded, Half dazed, lay lengthways in the sun. As when a clumsy grizzly bear Breaks on a dove-cot unaware, As when some snake, unwieldy heap, Drops from a pine-bough, half asleep, Plump in the midst of grazing sheep;— Even so into the women-swarm Suddenly fell the giant's form! They leapt, they scream'd, they closed, they scatter'd, Some fled, some stood, all call'd and chatter'd, And to the man in his amaze Innumerable seem'd as jays And parroquets in the green ways. Had they been men, despite their throng, In sooth he had lain still less long; But somehow in the stars 'twas fated, He for a space was fascinated! And ere he knew what he should do, All round about him swarm'd the crew, Sharp-eyed, quick-finger'd, and, despite His struggling, clung around him tight; Half choked, half smother'd by embraces, In a wild mist of arms and faces, He stagger'd up; in vain, in vain! Hags, squaws, and maidens in a chain Clung round him, and with quicker speed Than ye this running rhyme can read, With tendrils tough as thong of hide, Torn from the trees on every side, In spite of all his strength, the band Had bound the Giant foot and hand. IV. Thro' the Wood. Through the gleaming forest closes, Where on white magnolia-roses Light the dim-draped queen reposes, Lo, they lead the captive Giant. Shrieking shrill as jays around him, They have led him, they have bound him, With a wreath of vine-leaves crown'd him, Which he weareth, half defiant. If their ears could hear him swearing! Of his oaths he is not sparing, While, with hands sharp-claw'd for tearing. Hags and beldams burn to rend him. If the younger, prettier creatures Heard that tallest of beseechers, While he pleads with frantic features! But they do not comprehend him. In their Indian tongue they're crying, From the forest multiplying, Mocking, murmuring, leaping, flying, While he shouts out, ‘D—the women!’ All his mighty strength is nothing: Like a ship, despite his loathing, Mid these women scant of clothing He is tossing, struggling, screaming. Crown'd like Bacchus on he passes, O'er deep runlets, through great grasses, While [like flies around molasses] Fair and foul are round him humming! Half a day they westward wander, Stopping not to rest or ponder; Then the forest ends; and yonder Wild dogs bark to hear them coming. Cluster'd in an open clearing Stand the wigwams they are nearing, Bark the dogs, a strange foot fearing, Low the cattle,—straight before them. Out into the sunlight leaping, There they see the wigwams sleeping, With a blue smoke upward creeping, And the burning azure o'er them! All is still, save for the screaming Children from the wigwams streaming, All is still and sweet to seeming, Not a man's face forward thrusting. Thinks Eureka, ‘This looks stranger— Ne'er a man—then double danger; Many a year I've been a ranger,— Woman's mercy put no trust in!’ As he speaks in trepidation, All his heart in palpitation, He is fill'd with admiration At a vision wonder-laden. From the largest wigwam, slowly, While the women-band bow lowly, Comes an old man white and holy, Guided gently by a maiden! V. The Red Tribe. Ninety long years had slowly shed Their snows upon the patriarch's head, And on a staff of ash he leant, Shaking and bending as he went. His face, sepulchral, long, and thin, Was shrivell'd like a dried snake's skin, And on the cheeks and forehead dark Tattoo'd was many a livid mark, And in the midst his eyeballs white Roll'd blankly, seeing not the light; And when he listen'd in his place You saw at once that he was blind, For with a visionary grace Dim mem'ries moved from his own mind, And the wild waters of his face Waved in a wondrous wind. From an artistic point of sight, The aged man was faultless quite; Albeit the raiment he did wear Was somewhat hybrid; for example, A pair of pantaloons threadbare Match'd strangely with his Indian air, And blanket richly wrought and ample; And, though perchance not over clean, He had a certain gentle mien Kindly and kingly; and a smile Complacent in the kingly style, Yet fraught with strangely subtle rays, The lingering light of other days:— Brightness and motion such as we Trace in the trouble of the Sea, When the long stormy day is sped, And in the last light dusky-red The waves are sinking, one by one. But she who led him!—In the sun She gleam'd beside him, like a rose That by a dark sad water grows And trembles. In a moment's space Eureka recognised the face! 'Twas hers, who stood most beautiful, Queen of those bathers in the pool! But her bright locks were braided now Around her clear and glistening brow, And on her limbs she wore a dress Less rich than her own loveliness. From the artistic point of view, The maiden's dress was faultless too, But, look'd at closely, not so rare As white-skinn'd maid would wish to wear; 'Twas coarsest serge of sullen dye, Albeit embroider'd curiously; And the few ornaments she wore Were trifles valueless and poor;— Their merit, let us straight confess, And all the merit of her dress, Was that they form'd for eyes to see Nimbus enough of drapery And ornament, just to suggest The costume that became her best— Her own brave beauty. She just wore Enough for modesty—no more. She was not, as white beauties seem, Smother'd, like strawberries in cream, With folds of silk and linen. No! The Indians wrap their babies so, And we our women; who, alas! Waddle about upon the grass, Distorted, shapeless, smother'd, choking, Hideous, and horribly provoking, Because we long, without offence, To tear the mummy-wrappings thence, And show the human form enchanting That 'neath the fatal folds is panting! She was a shapely creature, tall, And slightly form'd, but plump withal,— Shapely as deer are—finely fair As creatures nourish'd by warm air, And luscious fruits that interfuse Something of their own glorious hues, And the rich odour that perfumes them, Into the body that consumes them. She had drank richness thro' and thro' As the great flowers drink light and dew; And she had caught from wandering streams Their restless motion; and strange gleams From snakes and flowers that glow'd around Had stolen into her blood, and found Warmth, peace, and silence; and, in brief, Her looks were bright beyond belief Of those who meet in the green ways The rum-wreck'd squaws of later days. [I would be accurate, nor essay Again in Cooper's pleasant way A picture highly wrought and splendid Of the red race whose pride has ended. Nor here by contrast err: indeed, The red man is of Esau's seed, Hath Esau's swiftness, and, I guess, Much, too, of Esau's loveliness. A thousand years in the free wild He fought and hunted, leapt and smiled; A million impulses and rays Shot thro' his spirit's tangled ways, Working within his dusky frame As in a storm-cloud worketh flame, Shaping his strength as years did roll Into the semblance of his soul. Slowly his shape and spirit caught The living likeness wonder-fraught, The golden, many-coloured moods Of those free plains and pathless woods; Those blooms that burst, those streams that run One changeless rainbow in the sun! Unto the hues of this rich clime His nature was subdued in time; And he became as years increased A glorious animal, at least.] Soon like a mist did disappear Eureka Hart's first foolish fear, For courteously the chief address'd him, In English speech distinct tho' broken, Bade them unloose and cease to pest him, And further, smiling and soft spoken, Inquired his country and his name, Whither he fared and whence he came. Eureka, from the withes released, Shook himself like a bright-eyed beast, And mutter'd; then, meeting the look Of that bright naïad of the brook, Blush'd like a shamefaced boy, while she Stood gazing on him silently, With melancholy orbs whose flame Confused his soul with secret shame. In a brief answer and explicit, He told the cause of his strange visit. The old chief smiled and whisper'd low Into the small ear of the maiden: Her large eyes fell, and with a glow Of dark, deep rose her face was laden. Then, like a sound of many waters, Innumerable screams and chatters, The voices of the women-band Broke out in passion and in power; But, at the raising of his hand, Ceased, like the swift cease of a shower. Full soon Eureka saw and knew That the Dark Dame who favours few Had brought him to a friendly place, Where, far from cities, a mild race Of happy Indians spent their days 'Mid pastures and well-water'd ways. An ancient people strong and good, With something sacred in their blood; Scatter'd and few, to strangers kind; Wise in the ways of rain and wind; Peaceful when pleased, bloody when roused, They dwelt there comfortably housed; And in those gardens ever fair, Hunted and fish'd with little care. Just then their braves were roaming bound On an adjacent hunting-ground; And all the population then Were women wild and aged men.— But he, that old man blind and tall, Was a great King, and Chief of all; And she who led him was by birth His grandchild, dearest thing on earth To his dusk age; and dear tenfold Because no other kin had she,— Since sire and mother both lay cold Under Death's leafless Upas-tree. Enough! here faltereth my first song: Eureka, still in secret captured, In that lost Eden lingers long, And his big bosom beats enraptured. Long days and nights speed o'er him there; What binds him now? a woman's hair! What doth he see? a woman's eyes Above him luminously rise! What doth he kiss? a woman's mouth Sweeter than spice-winds of the south! By golden streams he lies full blest, And Red Rose blossoms on his breast. O love! love! love! whose spells are shed On bodies black, white, yellow, red— Flame of all matter,—flower of clay,— Star of pangenesis;—but stay! A theme of so divine a tone Must have a canto of its own! PART II. RED ROSE. I. Erycina Ridens. O love! O spirit of being! O wonderful secret of breath, Sweeter than hearing or seeing, Sadder than sorrow or death. Earth with its holiest flavour, Life with its lordliest dower, The fruit's strange essence and flavour, Bloom and scent of the flower. [Thus might a modern poet, O Aphrodite, uptake His fanciful flute and blow it, And wail the echoes awake!] O love, love, Aphrodite, Cytherea divine, I hold you fever'd and flighty, And seek a pleasanter shrine. Yet hither, O spirit fervent, Just to help me along, Forget I am not thy servant, And blow in the sails of my song. For lo! 'tis a situation Caused by thyself, 'twould seem; The old, old foolish sensation, Two lovers lost in a dream. O the wonder and glory, Bright as Creation's burst! O the ancestral story, Old as Adam the first! Flame, and fervour, and fever, Flashing from morning to night, Alliteration for ever Of love, and longing, and light. How should the story vary? How the song be new? Music and meaning marry? 'Tis love, love, love, all thro'! As it was in the beginning, Is, and ever shall be! Loving, and love for the winning, Love, and the soul set free. [An invocation like this is Need not be over-wise; Who shall interpret kisses? What is the language of eyes?] Again a man and a woman Feeling the old blest thing, Better than voices human A bird on the bough could sing. Only a sound is wanted, Merry, and happy, and loud,— Such as the lark hath panted Up in the golden cloud. Lips, and lips to kiss them; Eyes, and eyes to behold; Hands, and hands to press them; Arms, and arms to enfold. The love that comes to the palace, That comes to the cottage door; The ever-abundant chalice Brimming for rich and poor; The love that waits for the winning, The love that ever is free, That was in the world's beginning, Is, and ever shall be! II. Log and Sunbeam. As a pine-log prostrate lying, Slowly thro' its knotted skin Feels the warm revivifying Spring-time thrill and tremble in; As a pine-log, strong and massive, Feels the light and lieth passive, While a Sunbeam, coming daily, Creeps upon its bosom gaily; Warms the bark with quick pulsations, Warms and waits each day in patience, While the green begins to brighten, And the sap begins to heighten,— Till at last from its hard bosom Suddenly there slips a blossom Green as emerald!—then another! Then a third! then more and more! Till the soft green bud-knots smother What was sapless wood before; Till the thing is consecrated To the spirit of the Spring, Till the love for all things fated Burns and beautifies the thing;— And the wood-doves sit and con it, And the squirrels from on high Fluttering drop their nuts upon it, And the bee and butterfly Find it pleasant to alight there, And taps busy morn and night there Many a bird with golden beak; Till, since all has grown so bright there, It would cry (if Logs could speak), ‘Sunbeam, sunbeam, I'm your debtor! I was fit for firewood nearly. I'm considerably better, And I love you, Sunbeam, dearly!’ . . . Thou, Eureka, wast the wood! She, the Sunbeam of the Spring, Vivifying thy dull blood Past thy mind's imagining! Till the passion of her loving, Seething forth with ardours frantic, Brought the buds forth, set thee moving, Made thee almost look romantic. ‘O would some power the giftie gie us To see oursels as others see us!’ Sang the wise ploughman in his power. And yet, Eureka, had sweet Heaven To thee her wondrous ‘giftie’ given To see thyself as seen that hour, To know thy features as she knew them, To see thy shape as she perceived it; To see thine eyes, and thro' and thro’ them, Into thy Soul as she conceived it; Either thy blood had run mad races, And driven thee to some maniac action; Or (what more likely in the case is) Thy wits had frozen to stupefaction! For never god in olden story, When the gods had honour due, Gather'd brighter guise and glory, In an adoring mortal's view. Let me own it, though thy nature Was sedate and beaver-bred, As a god thou wert in stature, Fair of face and proud of tread; And thine eyes were luminous glasses, And thy face a glorious scroll, And the radiant light that passes O'er the dumb flowers and the grasses, Caught thy gaze and look'd like Soul; And the animal vibration Throbbing in thee at her touch, The wild earthly exaltation, Beasts and birds can feel as much, Radiating and illuming Every fibre of thy flesh, Made thee beautiful and blooming, Great and glorious, fair and fresh; Fit it seem'd for love to yearn to, For a fairer Soul than thine, Morning, noon, and night to burn to, In a flash that felt divine. Her tall white chief, whom God had brought her From the far-off Big-Sea Water! Her warrior of the pale races, With wise tongues and paintless faces; More than mortal, a great creature, Soft of tongue, and fine of feature; As the wind that blew above her O'er the hunting-fields of azure, As the stately clouds that hover In the air that pants for pleasure, Full of strength and motion stately, Were thy face and form unto her; And thy blue eyes pleased her greatly, And thy clear voice trembled thro' her; And for minute after minute She did pore upon thy face, Read the lines and guess within it The great spirit of thy race; And thou seemedst altogether A great creature, fair of skin, Born in scenes of softer weather, Nobler than her savage kin! As a peasant maiden homely Might regard some lordly wooer, Find each feature trebly comely From the pride it stoops unto her; Thus, Eureka, she esteem'd thee Fairer for thy finer blood; She revered thee, loved thee, deem'd thee Wholly beautiful and good! And her day-dream ne'er was broken, As some mortal day-dreams are, By a word or sentence spoken In thy coarse vernacular. For she could not speak a dozen Words as used by the white nation! And thy speech seem'd finely chosen, Since she made her own translation, Scarce a syllable quite catching, Yet, upon thy bosom leaning, Out of ever sentence snatching Music with its own sweet meaning. Powers above! the situation's Psychological, I swear! How express the false relations Of this strange-assorted pair? Happy, glorious, self-deluded, On the handsome face she brooded, Ne'er by word or gesture driven From her day-dream sweet as heaven. In her native language for him She had warrior's names most sweet: And she loved and did adore him, Falling fawn-like at his feet; More, the rapturous exultation Struck him! blinded him, in turn! Till with passionate sensation Body and brain began to burn;— And he yielded to the bursting, Burning, blinding, hungering, thirsting, Passion felt by beasts and men! And his eyes caught love and rapture, And he held her close in capture, Kissing lips—that kiss'd again! III. Nuptial Song. Where were they wedded? In no Temple of ice Built up by human fingers; The floor was strewn with flowers of fair device, The wood-birds were the singers. Who was the Priest? The priest was the still Soul, Calm, gentle, and low-spoken; He read a running brooklet like a scroll, And trembled at the token. What was the service? 'Twas the service read When Adam's faith was plighted! The tongue was silent, but the lips rose-red In silence were united. Who saw it done? The million starry eyes Of one ecstatic Heaven. Who shared the joy? The flowers, the trees, the skies Thrill'd as each kiss was given. Who was the Bride? A spirit strong and true, Beauteous to human seeing,— Soft elements of flesh, air, fire, and dew, Blent in one Rose of being. What was her consecration? Innocence! Pure as the wood-doves round her, Nothing she knew of rites—the strength intense Of God and Nature found her. As freely as maids give a lock away, She gave herself unto him. What was the Bridegroom? Clay, and common clay, Yet the wild joy slipt through him. Hymen, O Hymen! By the birds was shed A matrimonial cadence! Da nuces! Squirrels strew'd the nuts, instead Of rosy youths and maidens! Eureka, yea, Eureka was to blame— He was an erring creature: Uncivilised by one wild flash of flame He waver'd back on Nature. He kiss'd her lips, he drank her breath in bliss, He drew her to his bosom: As a clod kindles at the Spring's first kiss His being burst to blossom! Who rung the bells? The breeze, the merry breeze, Set all in bright vibration: Clear, sweet, yet low, there trembled through the trees The nuptial jubilation! IV. Arretez! O'er this joy I dare not linger: Stands a Shape with lifted finger Crying in a low voice, ‘Singer! Far too much of Eve and Adam. ‘Details of this dark connection I desire not for inspection!’ And the Bard, with genuflexion, Answers, ‘I obey thee, Madam!’ Stands the Moral Shape reproving, While I linger o'er this loving; Cries the voice, ‘Pass on! be moving! We are virtuous, here to nor'ward!’ Constable, I force cessation To my flood of inspiration; Such a theme for adumbration! I resign it, and move forward. V. The Farewell. Love, O love! thou bright and burning Weathercock for ever turning; Gilded vane, fix'd for our seeing On the highest spire of being; Symbol, indication; reeling Round to every wind of feeling; Only pointing some sad morrow, In one sudden gust of sorrow, Sunset-ward, where redly, slowly, Passion sets in melancholy. In the wood-ways, roof'd by heaven, Were the nuptial kisses given; In the dark green, moonbeam-haunted Forest; in the bowers enchanted Where the fiery specks are flying, And the whip-poor-will is crying; Where the heaven's open blue eye Thro' the boughs broods dark and dewy, And the white magnolia glimmers Back the light in starry tremors; Where the acacia in the shady Silence trembles like a lady Scented sweet and softly breathing; There, amid the brightly wreathing, Blooming branches, did they capture Love's first consecrated rapture. Pure she came to him, a maiden Innocent as Eve in Eden, Tho' in secret; for she dreaded Wrath of kinsmen tiger-headed, In whose vision, fierce and awful, Love for white men was unlawful. Yet in this her simple reason Knew no darker touch of treason Than dost thou, O white and dainty English maid of sweet-and-twenty, When from guardian, father, brother, [Harsh protectors, one or t'other,] Off you trip, self-handed over To your chosen lord and lover, Tears of love and rapture shedding In the hush of secret wedding. Now from these lost days Elysian, Modestly I drop my vision! Rose the wave supreme and splendid, To a tremulous crest, and ended, Falling, falling, one sad morrow, In a starry spray of sorrow. Whether 'twas by days or hours, Weeks or months, in those bright bowers, They their gladness counted,—whether Like the one day's summer weather At the pole, their bliss upstarted, Brighten'd, blacken'd, and departed,— I relate not; all my story Is, that soon or late this glory Fell and faded. After daylight Came an eve of sad and gray light; There were tears—wild words were spoken Down the cup was dash'd, and broken. First came danger,—eyeballs fiery Watch'd the pair in fierce inquiry; Secret footsteps dodged the lovers; As a black hawk slowly hovers O'er the spot amid the heather Where the gray birds crouch together, Hung Suspicion o'er the places Where they sat with flaming faces. Next came—what d'ye call the dreary Heavy-hearted thing and weary, In old weeds of joy bedizen'd? By the shallow French 'tis christen'd Ennui! Ay, the snake that grovels In a host of scrofulous novels, Leper even of the leprous Race of serpents vain and viprous, Bred of slimy eggs of evil, Sat on by the printer's devil, Last, to gladden absinthe-lovers, Born by broods in paper covers! After the great wave of madness, Ennui came; and tho' in gladness Still the Indian maiden's nature Clung round the inferior creature, Though with burning, unconsuming, Deathless love her heart was blooming, He grew weary, and his passion In a dull evaporation Slowly lessen'd, till caressing Grew distracting and distressing. Conscience waken'd in a fever, Just a day too late, as ever; He remember'd, one fine day, His relations far away. All the beavers! the deceiver! After all, he was a beaver Born and bred, tho' the unchanging Dash of wild blood kept him ranging; Beaver-conscience, now awaken'd, Since the first true bliss had slacken'd, Whisper'd with a sad affection, ‘Fie! it is a strange connection! Is it worthy? Can it profit? Sits the world approving of it?’ While another whisper said, ‘You're a white man! She is red!’ Ne'ertheless he seem'd to love her, Watch'd her face and bent above her, Fondly thinking, ‘Now, I wonder If the world would blame my blunder? If her skin were only whiter, If her manners were politer, I would take her with me nor'ward, Wed her, cling to her thenceforward, Clothe her further, just a tittle, Live respectable and settle!’ She was silent, as he brooded Handsome-faced and beaver-mooded, Thinking, ‘Now my chief is seeming Where the fires of fight are streaming! O, how great and grand his face is, Lit with light of the pale races!’ And she bent her brows before him, Kiss'd his hands, and did adore him, And she waited in deep duty; While her eyes of dazzling beauty, Like two jewels ever streaming Broken yet unceasing rays, Watch'd him as in beaver-dreaming He would walk in the green ways. Still he seem'd to her a splendid Creature, but his trance had ended; More and more, thro' ever seeing Red skins round him, he lost patience, More and more the hybrid being Sigh'd for civilised relations; For Eureka Hart, tho' wholly Of a common social mind, Narrow-natured, melancholy, Hated ties of any kind;— Yet if any tie could hold him To a place or to a woman, 'Twould be one the world had told him Was respectable and common. Here, then, hemm'd in by a double Dark dilemma, he found trouble, And with look a Grecian painter Would have given to a god, Feeling passion still grow fainter, Thought, ‘I reckon things look odd! Wouldn't Parson Pendon frown, If he knew, in Drowsietown?’ As he spoke he saw the village Rising up with tilth and tillage, Saw the smithy, like an eye Flaming bloodshot at the sky, Saw the sleepy river flowing, Saw the swamps burn in the sun, Saw the people coming, going, All familiar, one by one. ‘There the plump old Parson goes, Silver buckles on his toes. Broad-brimm'd beaver on his head, Clean-shaved chin, and cheek as red As ripe pippins, kept in hay, Polish'd on Thanksgiving day; Black coat, breeches, all complete, On the old mare he keeps his seat, Jogging on with smiles so bright To creation left and right. There's the Widow Abner smiling At her door as he goes past, Guess she thinks she looks beguiling, But he cuts along more fast. There's Abe Sinker drunk as ever, There's the pigs all in the gutter, There's the miller by the river, Broad as long and fat as butter. See it all, so plain and pleasant, Just like life their shadows pass, Wonder how they are at present? Guess they think I'm gone to grass!’ While this scene he contemplated, Sighing like a homeless creature, Round him, brightly concentrated, Glow'd the primal fire of Nature! Rainbow-hued and rapturous-colour'd, With one burning brilliant look Flaming fix'd upon the dullard, Nature rose in wild rebuke! Shower'd her blossoms round him, o'er him, Breathed warm breath upon his face, Flash'd her flowers and fruits before him, Follow'd him from place to place; With wild jasmine and with amber She perfumed his sleeping chamber, Hung around him happy hours With her arms of lustre-flowers, Held to his in blest reposes Her warm breasts of living roses; Bade a thousand dazzling, crying, Living, creatures do him honour, Stood herself, naked and sighing, With an aureole upon her; Then, with finger flashing brightly Pointing to her prime creation,— Fruits and flowers and scents blent lightly In one dazzling adumbration,— Cried unto him over and over, ‘See my child! O love her, love her! I eternal am, no comer In a feeble flush of summer, Like the hectic colour flying Ot a maid love-sick and dying; Here no change, but ever burning Quenchless fire, and ceaseless yearning: Endless exquisite vibration Sweet as love's first nuptial kiss, One soft sob of strange sensation Flowering into shapes of bliss; And the brightest, O behold her With a changeless warmth like mine— Love her! In thy soul enfold hër! Blend with us, and be divine!’ All in vain that fond entreating! Still Eureka's beaver-brain Thought—‘This climate's rather heating— Weather's cooler up in Maine!’ Yet no wonder Nature loved him, Sought to take his soul by storm, Gloried when her meaning moved him, Clung in fondness round his form; For, in sooth, tho' unimpassion'd, Gloriously the man was fashion'd: One around whose strength and splendour Women would have pray'd to twine, As the lian loves to blend her Being with the beech or pine. And his smile when she was present Was seraphic, full of spirit, And his voice was low and pleasant, And her soul grew bright to hear it! And when tall he strode to meet her, And his handsome face grew sweeter, In her soul she thought, ‘O being, Fair and gracious and deep-seeing, White man, great man, far above me, What am I, that thou shouldst love me?’ She had learnt him with lips burning (O for such a course of learning!) Something of her speech,—'twas certain Quite enough to woo and flirt in; Words not easy of translation They transfused into sensation, Soon discovering and proving, As a small experience teaches, ‘Bliss’ and ‘kiss,’ and other loving Words, are common to all speeches! Ah, the rapture! ah, the fleeting Follies of each fond, mad meeting! Smiling with red lips asunder, Clapping hands at each fond blunder, She instructed him right gaily In her Indian patois daily, Sweetly from his lips it sounded, Help'd with those great azure eyes, Till upon his heart she bounded Panting praise with laughs and cries. 'Twas a speech antique and olden, Full of gurgling notes, it ran Like some river rippling golden Down a vale Arcadian; Like the voices of doves brooding; Like a fountain's gentle moan; Nothing commonplace intruding On its regal monotone: Sounds and symbols interblending Like the heave of loving bosoms; Consonants like strong boughs bending, Snowing vowels down like blossoms! Faltering in this tongue, he told her, Sitting in a secret place, While with bright head on his shoulder, Luminous-eyed, she watch'd his face, How, tho' every hour grown fonder, Tho' his soul was still aflame, Still, he sigh'd once more to wander To the clime from whence he came; Just once more to look upon it, Just for one brief hour to con it, Just to see his kin and others In the Town where they did dwell. Just to say to his white brothers One farewell, a last farewell. Then to hasten back unto her, And to live with her and die. . . , Sharp as steel his speech stabb'd thro' her, Cold she sat without a cry, On her heart her small hand pressing, Breathing like a bird in pain, Silent, tho' he smiled caressing, Kiss'd, but kissing not again. Then she waken'd, like one waking From a trance, and with heart aching Clung around him, as if dreading Lest some hand should snatch him thence! Then, upon his bosom shedding Tears of ecstacy intense, By her gods conjured him wildly Never, never to depart! O how meekly, O how mildly, Answer'd back Eureka Hart! But by slow degrees he coax'd her, Night by night, and day by day, With such specious spells he hoax'd her That her first fear fled away. Slow she yielded, still believing Not for long he'd leave her lonely; For he told her, still deceiving, 'Twas a little journey only. Poor, dark bird! nought then knew she Of this world's geography! Troubled, shaken, half-demented, Broken-hearted—she assented. Since, by wind, and wave, and vapour, By the shapes of earth and skies; By the white moon's ghostly taper, By the stars that like dead eyes Watch it burning; by the mystic Motion of the winds and woods; By all dark and cabalistic Shapes of tropic solitudes; By the waters melancholy; By God's hunting-fields of blue; By all things that she deem'd holy He had promised to be true! Just to pay a flying visit To connections close at hand, Then to haste with love undying Back unto that happy land. 'Twas enough! the Maid assented, Thinking sadly, in her pain, ‘He will never be contented Till he sees them once again. Thither, thither let him wander; When once more I feel his kiss, His proud spirit will be fonder Since my love hath granted this!’ ‘Go!’ she cried, and her dark features Kindled like a dying creature's, And her heart rose, and her spirit Cried as if for God to hear it— Wildly in her arms she press'd him To her bosom broken-hearted— Call'd upon her gods, and blest him! And Eureka Hart departed. VI. The Paper. Here should my second canto end—yet stay Listen a little ere ye turn away. By night they parted; and she cut by night One large lock from his forehead, which with bright, Warm lips she kiss'd; then kiss'd the lock of hair, With one quick sob of passionate despair; And he, with hand that shook a little now, Still with that burning seal upon his brow, While in that bitter agony they embraced, He in her little hand a paper placed, Whereon, at her fond prayer, he had writ plain, ‘Eureka Hart, Drowsietown, State of Maine.’ ‘For,’ thought he, ‘I have promised soon or late Hither to come again to her, my mate; And I will keep my promise, sure, some day, Unless I die or sicken by the way. But no man knows what pathway he may tread,— To-morrow—nay, ere dawn—I may be dead! And she shall know, lest foul my fortune proves, The name and country of the man she loves; And since she wishes it, to cheer her heart, It shall be written down ere I depart.’ And so it was; and while his kiss thrill'd thro' her, With that loved lock of hair he gave it to her. Aye, so it was; for in the woods at dawn He from his pouch had an old letter drawn, One leaf of which was blank, and this he took, And smiling at the woman's wondering look, While quietly she murmur'd, ‘'Tis a charm!’ In hunter's fashion he had prick'd his arm, And, having pen nor ink, had ta'en a spear Of thorn for stylus, and in crimson clear, His own heart's blood, had writ the words she sought. And in that hour deep pity in him wrought, And he believed that he his vows would keep, Nor e'er be treacherous to a love so deep. ‘See!’ said he, as the precious words he gave, ‘Keep this upon thy bosom, and be brave. As sure as that red blood belong'd to me, I shall, If I live on, return to thee. If death should find me while thou here dost wait, Thou canst at least make question of my fate Of any white man whose stray feet may fare Down hither, showing him the words writ there.’ All this he said to her with faltering voice In broken Indian, and in words less choice; And quite persuaded of his good intent, Shoulder'd his gun with a gay heart, and went. And in that paper, while her fast tears fell, She wrapt the lock of hair she loved so well, And thrust it on her heart; and with sick sight, Watch'd his great figure fade into the night; Then raised her hands to her wild gods, that sped Above her in a whirlwind overhead, And the pines rock'd in tempest, and her form Bent broken with the breathing of the storm. O little paper! Blurr'd with secret tears! O blood-red charm! O thing of hopes and fears! Between two worlds a link, so faint, so slight, The two worlds of the red man and the white! Lie on her heart and soothe her soul's sad pain! ‘Eureka Hart, Drowsietown, State of Maine.’ PART III. WHITE ROSE. I. Drowsietown. O so drowsy! In a daze Sweating 'mid the golden haze, With its smithy like an eye Glaring bloodshot at the sky, And its one white row of street Carpetted so green and sweet, And the loungers smoking still Over gate and window-sill; Nothing coming, nothing going, Locusts grating, one cock crowing, Few things moving up or down, All things drowsy—Drowsietown! Thro' the fields with sleepy gleam, Drowsy, drowsy steals the stream, Touching with its azure arms Upland fields and peaceful farms, Gliding with a twilight tide Where the dark elms shade its side; Twining, pausing sweet and bright Where the lilies sail so white; Winding in its sedgy hair Meadow-sweet and iris fair; Humming as it hies along Monotones of sleepy song; Deep and dimpled, bright nut-brown, Flowing into Drowsietown. Far as eye can see, around, Upland fields and farms are found, Floating prosperous and fair In the mellow misty air: Apple-orchards, blossoms blowing Up above,—and clover growing Red and scented round the knees Of the old moss-silvered trees. Hark! with drowsy deep refrain, In the distance rolls a wain; As its dull sound strikes the ear, Other kindred sounds grow clear— Drowsy all—the soft breeze blowing, Locusts grating, one cock crowing, Cries like voices in a dream Far away amid the gleam, Then the waggons rumbling down Thro' the lanes to Drowsietown. Drowsy? Yea!—but idle? Nay! Slowly, surely, night and day, Humming low, well greased with oil, Turns the wheel of human toil. Here no grating gruesome cry Of spasmodic industry; No rude clamour, mad and mean, Of a horrible machine! Strong yet peaceful, surely roll'd, Winds the wheel that whirls the gold. Year by year the rich rare land Yields its stores to human hand— Year by year the stream makes fat Every field and meadow-flat— Year by year the orchards fair Gather glory from the air, Redden, ripen, freshly fed, Their bright balls of golden red. Thus, most prosperous and strong, Flows the stream of life along Six slow days! wains come and go, Wheat-fields ripen, squashes grow, Cattle browse on hill and dale, Milk foams sweetly in the pail, Six days: on the seventh day, Toil's low murmur dies away— All is husht save drowsy din Of the waggons rolling in, Drawn amid the plenteous meads By small fat and sleepy steeds. Folk with faces fresh as fruit Sit therein or trudge afoot, Brightly drest for all to see, In their seventh-day finery: Farmers in their breeches tight, Snowy cuffs, and buckles bright; Ancient dames and matrons staid In their silk and flower'd brocade, Prim and tall, with soft brows knitted, Silken aprons, and hands mitted; Haggard women, dark of face, Of the old lost Indian race; Maidens happy-eyed and fair, With bright ribbons in their hair, Trip along, with eyes cast down, Thro' the streets of Drowsietown. Drowsy in the summer day In the meeting-house sit they; 'Mid the high-back'd pews they doze, Like bright garden-flowers in rows; And old Parson Pendon, big In his gown and silver'd wig, Drones above in periods fine Sermons like old-flavour'd wine— Crusted well with keeping long In the darkness, and not strong. O! so drowsily he drones In his rich and sleepy tones, While the great door, swinging wide, Shows the bright green street outside, And the shadows as they pass On the golden sunlit grass. Then the mellow organ blows, And the sleepy music flows, And the folks their voices raise In old unctuous hymns of praise, Fit to reach some ancient god Half asleep with drowsy nod. Deep and lazy, clear and low, Doth the oily organ grow! Then with sudden golden cease Comes a silence and a peace; Then a murmur, all alive, As of bees within a hive; And they swarm with quiet feet Out into the sunny street; There, at hitching-post and gate Do the steeds and waggons wait. Drawn in groups, the gossips talk, Shaking hands before they walk: Maids and lovers steal away, Smiling hand in hand, to stray By the river, and to say Drowsy love in the old way— Till the sleepy sun shines down On the roofs of Drowsietown. In the great marsh, far beyond Street and building, lies the Pond, Gleaming like a silver shield In the midst of wood and field; There on sombre days you see Anglers old in reverie, Fishing feebly morn to night For the pickerel so bright. From the woods of beech and fir, Dull blows of the woodcutter Faintly sound; and haply, too, Comes the cat-owl's wild ‘tuhoo!’ Drown'd by distance, dull and deep, Like a dark sound heard in sleep;— And a cock may answer, down In the depths of Drowsietown. Such is Drowsietown—but nay! Was, not is, my song should say— Such was summer long ago In this town so sleepy and slow. Change has come: thro' wood and dale Runs the demon of the rail, And the Drowsietown of yore Is not drowsy and more! O so drowsy! In the haze Of those long dead summer days, Underneath the still blue sky I can see the hamlet lie— Like a river in a dream Flows the little nut-brown stream; Yet not many a mile away Flashes foam and sprinkles spray, Close at hand the green marsh flows Into brackish pools and sloughs, And with storm-wave fierce and frantic Roars the wrath of the Atlantic. Waken Drowsietown?—The Sea? Break its doze and reverie? Nay, for if it hears at all Those unresisting waters call, They are far enough, I guess, Just to soothe and not distress. When the wild nor'wester breaks, And the sullen thunder shakes, For a space the Town in fear, Dripping wet with marsh and mere, Quakes and wonders, and is found With its ear against the ground Listening to the sullen war Of the flashing sea afar! But the moment all is done On its tear-drops gleams the sun, Each rude murmur dies; and lo! In a sleepy sunny glow, 'Mid the moist rays slanting down, Once more dozes Drowsietown. As the place is, drowsy-eyed Are the folks that there abide; Strong, phlegmatic, calm, revealing No wild fantasies of feeling; Loving sunshine; on the soil Basking in a drowsy toil. Mild and mellow, calm and clear, Flows their life from year to year— Each fulfils his drowsy labour, Each the picture of his neighbour, Each exactly, rich or poor, What his father was before— O so drowsy! In a gleam, Far too steady to be Dream, Flows their slow humanity Winding, stealing, to the Sea. Sea? What Sea? The Waters vast, Whither all life flows at last, Where all individual motion Lost in one imperious ocean Fades, as yonder river doth In the great Sea at its mouth. Ah! the mighty wondrous Deep, 'Tis so near;—yet half asleep, Deaf to all its busy hum, These calm people go and come;— Quite forgetting it is nigh, Save when hurricanes go by With a ghostly wail o'erhead Shrieking shrill—‘Bury your dead!’ For a moment, wild-eyed, caught In a sudden gust of thought, Panting, praying, wild of face, Stand the people of the place; But, directly all is done, They are smiling in the sun— Drowsy, yet busy as good bees Working in a sunny ease, To and fro, and up and down, Move the folks of Drowsietown. II. After Meeting. DEACON JONES. Well, winter's over altogether; The loon's come back to Purley Pond; It's all green grass and pleasant weather Up on the marsh and the woods beyond. It's God Almighty's meaning clear To give us farmers a prosperous year; Tho' many a sinner that I could mention Is driving his ploughshare nowadays Clean in the teeth of the Lord's intention, And spiling the land he ought to raise. DEACON HOLMES. I've drained the marsh by Simpson's building, Cleared out the rushes, and flag, and weed, The ground's all juicy, and looks like yielding, And I'm puttin' it down in pip-corn seed. How's Father Abel? Comin' round? Glad the rheumatics have left him now. DEACON JONES. Summer's his med'cine; he'll soon be sound, And spry as a squirrel on a bough. BIRD CHORUS. Chickadee! chickadee! Green leaves on every tree! Over field, over foam, All the birds are coming home. Honk! honk! sailing low, Cried the gray goose long ago. Weet! weet! in the light Flutes the phœbe-bird so bright. Chewink, veery, thrush o' the wood, Silver treble raise together; All around their dainty food Ripens with the ripening weather. Hear, O hear! In the great elm by the mere Whip-poor-will is crying clear. MOTHER ABNER. And so it is! And so the news is true! And your Eureka has returned to you; I saw him in the church, and took a stare. A Hart, aye every inch, the tallest there. You'll hold the farm-land now, and keep things clear; You wanted jest a man—Eureka's here. WIDOW HART. Well, I don't know. Eureka ain't no hand At raising crops or looking after land; It's been a bitter trial to me, neighbour, To see his wandering ways and hate o' labour. He's been abroad too much to care jest now For white men's ways, and following the plough. MOTHER ABNER. He's a fine figure and a handsome face; There ain't his ekal this day in the place. And if he'd take a wife and settle down, There's many a wench would jump in Drowsietown. Ah! that's the only way to tie your son, And now he's got the farm 'tis easy done; There's Jez'bel Jones, and there's Euphemia Clem, And Sarah Snowe,—they're all good matches, them. And there's—why, there he goes, right down the flat, Looks almost furrin' in that queer straw hat; And who's that with him in the flower'd chintz dress? Why, Phœbe Anna Cattison, I guess! That little mite! How tiny and how prim Trips little Phœbe by the side of him! And when she looks up in his face, tehee! It's like a chipmunk looking up a tree! THE RIVER SINGS. O willow loose lightly Your soft long hair! I'll brush it brightly With tender care; And past you flowing I'll softly uphold Great lilies blowing With hearts of gold. For spring is beaming, The wind's in the south, And the musk-rat's swimming, A twig in its mouth, To built its nest Where it loves it best, In the great dark nook By the bed o' my brook. It's spring, bright spring, And blue-birds sing! And the fern is pearly All day long, And the lark rises early To sing a song. The grass shoots up like fingers of fire, And the flowers awake to a dim desire, So willow, willow, shake down, shake down Your locks so silvern and long and slight; For lovers are coming from Drowsietown, And thou and I must be merry and bright! PHŒBE ANNA. This is the first fine day this year: The grass is dry and the sky is clear; The sun's out shining; up to the farm It looks like summer; so bright and warm; There's apple blooms on the boughs already, Long as your finger the corn-blades shoot, And father thinks, if the sun keeps steady, 'Twill be a wonderful fall for fruit. How do you like being here at home again? Reckon you'd rather pack up and roam again! EUREKA. I'm sick o' roaming, I hate strange places; I've slep' too long in the woods and brakes; It's pleasure seeing white folks' faces After the b'ars, and the birds, and the snakes. This yer life is civilisation, T'other's a heathen dissipation! One likes to die where his father before him Died, with the same sky shinin' o'er him. I've been a wastrel and that's the truth, Earning nought but a sneer and a frown; I've wasted the precious days o' youth, Instead of stopping and settling down. PHŒBE ANNA. But now the farm is your own to dwell in, You'll ne'er go back to the wilderness? EUREKA. Waal! that's a question! There's no tellin'; I ain't my own master quite, I guess. Think I shall have to go some day, And fix some business far away. I—there's your mother beckonin' yonder, Looks kind o' huffish, you'd better run; (Alone, sotto voce) That girl's a sort of a shinin' wonder, The prettiest pout beneath the sun. BIRD CHORUS. Chickadee! chickadee! Green leaves on every tree; Winter goes, spring is here; Little mate, we loved last year. Cheewink, veery, robin red, Shall we take another bride? We have plighted, we are wed. Here we gather happy-eyed. Little bride, little mate, Shall I leave you desolate? Men change; shall we change too? Men change; but we are true. If I cease to love thee best, May a black boy take my nest. EUREKA. Soothin' it is, after so many a year, To hear the Sabbath bells a-ringing clear, The air so cool and soft, the sky so blue, The place so peaceful and so well-to-do. . . . Wonder what she is doing this same day? Thinkin' o' me in her wild Injin way, Listenin' and waitin', dreaming every minute The door will open, and this child step in it. Poor gal! I seem to feel her eyes so bright A-followin' me about, morn, noon, and night! Sometimes they make me start and thrill right thro'— She was a splendid figure, and that's true! Not jest like Christian women, fair and white, A heap more startlin' and a deal more bright; And as for looks, why many would prefer That Phœbe Ann, or some white gal like her! Don't know! I've got no call to judge; but see! The little white wench is so spry and free! And tho' she's but a mite, small as a mouse, She'd look uncommon pretty in a house. No business, tho', of mine—I've made my bed, And I must lie in it, as I have said. Ye . . . s, I'll go back—and stay—or bring her here, But there's no call to hurry yet, that's clear. She'll fret and be impatient for a while, And go on in the wild mad Injin style; But she can't know, for a clear heathen's sake, The sort o' sacrifice I'm fix'd to make. Some wouldn't do it; Parson there would say It's downright throwing next world's chance away; But I've made up my mind—it's fix'd at present; And—there, let's try to think of something pleasant! THE CAT-OWL. Boohoo! boohoo! White man is not true; I have seen such wicked ways That I hide me all the days, And come from my hole so deep While the white man lies asleep. A misanthrope am I, And, tho' the skies are blue, I utter my warning cry— Boohoo! Boohoo! boohoo! boohoo! THE LOON. (Chuckling to himself on the pond.) Ha! ha! ha! back again, Thro' the frost and fog and rain; Winter's over now, that's plain. Ha! ha! ha! back again! And I laugh and scream, For I love so well The bright, bright bream, And the pickerel! And soft is my breast, And my bill is keen, And I'll build my nest 'Mid the sedge unseen. I've travell'd—I've fish'd in the sunny south, In the mighty mere, at the harbour mouth; I've seen fair countries, all golden and gay; I've seen bright pictures that beat all wishing; I've found fine colours far away— But give me Purley Pond, for fishing; Of all the ponds, north, south, east, west, This is the pond I love the best; For all is quiet, and few folk peep, Save some of the innocent angling people; And I like on Sundays, half asleep, All alone on the pool so deep, To rock and hear the bells from the steeple. And I laugh so clear that all may hear The loon is back, and summer is near. Ha! ha! ha! so merry and plain I laugh with joy to be home again. (A shower passes over; all things sing.) The swift is wheeling and gleaming, The brook is brown in its bed, Rain from the cloud is streaming, And the Bow bends overhead. The charm of the winter is broken! the last of the spell is said! The eel in the pond is quick'ning, The grayling leaps in the stream— What if the clouds are thick'ning? See how the meadows gleam! The spell of the winter is shaken; the world awakes from a dream! The fir puts out green fingers, The pear-tree softly blows, The rose in her dark bower lingers, But her curtains will soon unclose, The lilac will shake her ringlets over the blush of the rose. The swift is wheeling and gleaming, The woods are beginning to ring, Rain from the cloud is streaming;— There, where the Bow doth cling, Summer is smiling afar off, over the shoulder of Spring! III. Phœbe Anna. Dimpled, dainty, one-and-twenty, Rosy-faced and round of limb, Warm'd with mother-wit in plenty, Prudent, modest, spry yet prim, Lily-handed, tiny-footed, With an ankle clean and neat, Neatly gloved and trimly booted, Looking nice and smelling sweet! Self-possess'd, subduing beauty To a sober sense of duty, Chaste as Dian, plump as Hebe, Such I guess was little Phœbe. O how different a creature From that other wondrous woman! Not a feeling, not a feature, Had these two fair flowers in common. One was tall and moulded finely, Large of limb, and grand of gaze, Rich with incense, and divinely Throbbing into passionate rays,— Lustrous-eyed and luscious-bosom'd, Beautiful, and richly rare, As a passion-flower full blossom'd, Born to Love and Love's despair. Such was Red Rose; and the other? Tiny, prudish, if you please, Meant to be a happy mother, With a bunch of huswife's keys. Prudent, not to be deluded, Happy-eyed and sober-mooded, Dainty, mild, yet self-reliant, She, as I'm a worthy singer, Wound our vacillating giant Round her little dimpled finger. Bit by bit, a bashful wooer, Fascinated unaware, Did Eureka draw unto her, Tame as any dancing bear. Not a finger did she stir, Yet he glow'd and gazed at her! Not a loving look she gave, Yet he watch'd her like a slave! He, who had been used to having Pleasures past all human craving, Who had idly sat and taken Showers of kisses on him shaken, Who had fairly tired of passion Ever felt in passive fashion, Now stood blushing like a baby In the careless eyes of Phœbe! Fare ye well, O scenes of glory, One bright shect of golden sheen! Love, the spirit of my story, Wakens in a different scene. Down the lanes, so tall and leafy, Falls Eureka's loving feet, Following Phœbe's, but in chief he In the kitchen loves to sit,— Loves to watch her, tripping ruddy In the rosy firelight glow, Loves to watch, in a brown study, The warm figure come and go. Half indifferent unto him, Far too wise to coax and woo him, Ill-disposed to waste affection, Full of modest circumspection, Quite the bright superior being, Tho' so tiny to the seeing, With a mind which penetrated, In a sly and rosy mirth, Thro' the face, and estimated Grain by grain the spirit's worth, Phœbe Anna, unenraptured, Led the creature she had captured. What is Love? A shooting star, Flying, flashing, lost afar. What is Man? A fretful boy, Ever seeking some new toy. What is Memory? Alas! 'Tis a strange magician's glass, Where you pictures bright may mark If you hold it in the dark. Thrust it out into the sun, All the picturing is done, And the magic dies away In the golden glow of day! Coming back to civilisation, Petted, fêted, shone on daily, Was a novel dissipation, And Eureka revell'd gaily. Friendly faces flash'd around him, Church-bells tinkled in his ear, Cosy cronies sought and found him, Drowsietown look'd bright and clear. Parson Pendon and his lady (Respectability embodied) Welcom'd the stray sheep already, Matrons smiled, and deacons nodded. Uncle Pete had left him lately Malden Farm and all its store, And he found himself prized greatly As a worthy bachelor. All his roaming days seem'd over! Like a beast without a load, Grazing in the golden clover, In the village he abode! And he loved the tilth and tillage, All the bustle of the village— Loved the reaping and the sowing, Loved the music of the mill, Loved to see the mowers mowing, And the golden grasses growing, Breast-deep, near the river still. Civilisation altogether Seem'd exactly to his notion! Life was like good harvest weather, Faintly flavoured with devotion, Ruefully he cogitated, With the peaceful spire in sight:— ‘Waal, I guess the thing was fated, And it's hard to set it right. Seems a dream, too! now, I wonder If it seems a dream to her! After that first parting stunn'd her, For a time she'd make a stir; P'raps, tho', when the shock was over, Other sentiments might move her! First she'd cry, next, she'd grow fretful, Thirdly, riled, and then forgetful. After all that's done and said, Injin blood is Injin ever! I'm a white skin she's a red; Providence just made us sever. Parson says that sort of thing Isn't moral marrying! Tho' the simple creature yonder Had no better education— Ignorance jest made her fonder, And I yielded to temptation. Here's the question: I've been sinning— Wrong, clean wrong, from the beginning; Can I make my blunder better By repeating it again? When mere Nature, if I let her, Soon can cure the creature's pain; She'll forget me fast enough— And she's no religious feeling; Injin hearts are always tough, And their wounds are quick of healing. Heigho!’—here he sighed; then seeing Phœbe Ann trip by in laughter, Brightening up, the bother'd being Shook off care, and trotted after! Had this final complication Not been added to the rest; Had not Fate with new temptation Drugg'd the conscience of his breast, Possibly his better nature Might have triumph'd o'er the treason; But the passions of the creature Rose in league with his false reason; On the side of civilisation Rose the pretty Civilisee: In a flush of new sensation, Conscience died, and Shame did flee. That bright picture, many-colour'd, Nature had flash'd before the dullard; That wild ecstasy and rapture She had tamed unto his capture— That grand form, intensely burning To a lightning-flash of yearning— That fair face transfigur'd brightly Into starry rapture nightly— Those large limbs of living lustre, Moving with a flower-like grace— Those great joys which hung in cluster, Like ripe fruit in a green place— All had faded from his vision, And instead, before his sight, Tript the pretty-faced precisian, Deep and dimpled, warm and white! In her very style of looking There was cognisance of cooking! From her very dress were peeping Indications of housekeeping! You might gather in a minute, As she lightly passed you by, She could (with her whole heart in it!) Nurse a babe or make a pie. Yet her manner and expression Shook the foolish giant's nerve, With their quiet self-possession And their infinite reserve. In his former time the wooing Had been all the female's doing; He had waited while the other Did his soul with raptures smother! But 'twas quite another matter, Here in civilisation's school! And his heart went pitter-patter, And he trembled like a fool. Thro' the church the road lay to her;— That was written on her face, Lawfully the man must woo her In the manner of her race. So by slow degrees he enter'd Courtship's Maze so mystic-centred! Round and round the pathways wander'd, Made his blunders, puzzled, ponder'd; Laugh'd at, laughing, scorn'd, imploring, Mad, enraged, distraught, adoring; This way, that way, turning, twisting; Yielding oft, and oft resisting: Gasping while the voice of Cupid Madden'd him with ‘Hither, stupid!’ Seeking ever for the middle Of the green and golden riddle— Oft, just as he cried, ‘I've got it!’ Finding culs de sac, and not it! Till at last his blunders ended On a summer morning splendid, When with vision glad and hazy, Seeing Phœbe blushing falter, In the centre of the Maze, he Found himself before—an Altar! IV. Nuptial Song. Where were they wedded? In the holy house Built up by busy fingers. All Drowsietown was quiet as a mouse To hear the village singers. Who was the Priest? 'Twas Parson Pendon, dress'd In surplice to the knuckles, Wig powder'd, snowy cambric on his breast, Silk stockings, pumps, and buckles. What was the service? 'Twas the solemn, stale, Old-fashioned, English measure: ‘Wilt thou this woman take? and thou this male?’ ‘I will’—‘I will’—with pleasure. Who saw it done? The countless rustic eyes Of folk around them thronging. Who shared the joy? The matrons with soft sighs, The girls with bright looks longing. Who was the bride? Sweet Phœbe, dress'd in clothes As white as she who wore 'em, Sweet-scented, self-possess'd,—one bright White Rose Of virtue and decorum. Her consecration? Peaceful self-control, And modest circumspection— The sweet old service softening her soul To formulised affection. Surveying with calm eyes the long, straight road Of matrimonial being, She wore her wedding clothes, trusting in God, Domestic, and far-seeing. With steady little hand she sign'd her name, Nor trembled at the venture. What did the Bridegroom? Blush'd with sheepish shame, Endorsing the indenture. O Hymen, Hymen! In the church so calm Began the old sweet story, The parson smiled, the summer fields breathed balm, The crops were in their glory. Out from the portal came the wedding crew, All smiling, palpitating;— And there was Jacob with the cart, bran new, And the white pony, waiting. The girls waved handkerchiefs, the village boys Shouted, around them rushing, And off they trotted thro' the light and noise, She calm, the giant blushing. Down the green road, along by glade and grove, They jog, with rein-bells jingling, The orchards pink all round, the sun above, She cold, Eureka tingling. And round her waist his arm becomes entwined, But still her ways are coolish— ‘There's old Dame Dartle looking! Don't now! Mind The pony! Guess you're foolish!’ Who rang the bells? The ringers with a will Set them in soft vibration. Hark! loud and clear, there chimes o'er vale and hill The nuptial jubilation. PART IV. THE GREAT SNOW. I. The Great Snow. 'Twas the year of the Great Snow. First the East began to blow Chill and shrill for many days, On the wild wet woodland ways. Then the North, with crimson cheeks, Blew upon the pond for weeks, Chill'd the water thro' and thro', Till the first thin ice-crust grew Blue and filmy; then at last All the pond was frosted fast, Prison'd, smother'd, fetter'd tight, Let it struggle as it might. And the first Snow drifted down On the roofs of Drowsietown. First the vanguard of the Snow; Falling flakes, whirling slow, Drifting darkness, troubled dream; Then a motion and a gleam; Sprinkling with a carpet white Orchards, swamps, and woodland ways, Thus the first Snow took its flight, And there was a hush for days. 'Mid that hush the Spectre dim, Faint of breath and thin of limb, Hoar-frost, like a maiden's ghost, Nightly o'er the marshes crost In the moonlight: where she flew, At the touch of her chill dress Cobwebs of the glimmering dew Froze to silvern loveliness. All the night, in the dim light, Quietly she took her flight; Thro' the streets she crept, and stayed In each silent window shade, With her finger moist as rain Drawing flowers upon the pane;— On the phantom flowers so drawn With her frozen breath breath'd she; And each window-pane at dawn Turn'd to crystal tracery! Then the Phantom Fog came forth, Following slowly from the North; Wheezing, coughing, blown, and damp, He sat sullen in the swamp, Scowling with a blood-shot eye; As the canvas-backs went by; Till the North-wind, with a shout, Thrust his pole and poked him out; And the Phantom with a scowl, Black'ning night and dark'ning day, Hooted after by the owl, Lamely halted on his way. Now in flocks that ever increase Honk the armies of the geese, 'Gainst a sky of crimson red Silhouetted overhead. After them in a dark mass, Sleet and hail hiss as they pass, Rattling on the frozen lea With their shrill artillery. Then a silence: then comes on Frost, the steel-bright Skeleton! Silent in the night he steals, With wolves howling at his heels, Seeing to the locks and keys On the ponds and on the leas. Touching with his tingling wand Trees and shrubs on every hand, Till they change, transform'd to sight, Into dwarfs and druids white,— Icicle-bearded, frosty-shrouded Underneath his mantle clouded; And on many of their shoulders, Chill, indifferent to beholders, Sits the barr'd owl in a heap, Ruffled, dumb, and fast asleep. There the legions of the trees Gather ghost-like round his knees; While in cloudy cloak and hood, Cold he creeps to the great wood:— Lying there in a half-doze, While on finger-tips and toes Squirrels turn their wheels, and jays Flutter in a wild amaze, And the foxes, lean and foul, Look out of their holes and growl. There he waiteth, breathing cold On the white and silent wold. In a silence sat the Thing, Looking north, and listening! And the farmers drave their teams Past the woods and by the streams, Crying as they met together, With chill noses, ‘Frosty weather!’ And along the iron ways Tinkle, tinkle, went the sleighs. And the wood-chopper did hie, Leather stockings to the thigh, Crouching on the snow that strew'd Every corner of the wood. Still Frost waited, very still; Then he whistled, loud and shrill; Then he pointed north, and lo! The main Army of the Snow. Black as Erebus afar, Blotting sun, and moon, and star, Drifting, in confusion driven, Screaming, straggling, rent and riven, Whirling, wailing, blown afar In an awful wind of War, Dragging drifts of death beneath, With a melancholy groan, While the fierce Frost set his teeth, Rose erect, and waved them on! All day long the legions passed On an ever-gathering blast; In an ever-gathering night, Fast they eddied on their flight. With a tramping and a roar, Like the waves on a wild shore; With a motion and a gleam, Whirling, driven in a dream; On they drave in drifts of white, Burying Drowsietown from sight, Covering ponds, and woods and roads, Shrouding trees and men's abodes; While the great Pond loaded deep, Turning over in its sleep, Groaned;—but when night came, forsooth, Grew the tramp unto a thunder; Wind met wind with wail uncouth, Frost and Storm fought nail and tooth, Shrieking, and the roofs rock'd under. Scared out of its sleep that night, Drowsietown awoke in fright; Chimney-pots above it flying, Windows crashing to the ground, Snow-flakes blinding, multiplying, Snow-drift whirling round and round; While, whene'er the strife seemed dying, The great North-wind, shrilly crying, Clash'd his shield in battle-sound! Multitudinous and vast, Legions after legions passed. Still the air behind was drear With new legions coming near; Still they waver'd, wander'd on, Glimmer'd, trembled, and were gone. While the drift grew deeper, deeper, On the roofs and at the doors, While the wind awoke each sleeper With its melancholy roars. Once the Moon looked out, and lo! Blind against her face the Snow Like a wild white grave-cloth lay, Till she shuddering crept away. Then thro' darkness like the grave, On and on the legions drave. When the dawn came, Drowsietown Smother'd in the snow-drift lay. Still the swarms were drifting down In a dark and dreadful day. On the blinds the whole day long Thro' the red light shadows flitted. At the inn in a great throng Gossips gather'd drowsy-witted. All around on the white lea Farm-lamps twinkled drearily; Not a road was now revealed, Drift, deep drift, at every door; Field was mingled up with field, Stream and pond were smother'd o'er, Trees and fences fled from sight In the deep wan waste of white. Many a night, many a day, Pass'd the wonderful array, Sometimes in confusion driven, By the dreadful winds of heaven; Sometimes gently wavering by With a gleam and smothered sigh, While the lean Frost still did stand Pointing with his skinny hand Northward, with the shrubs and trees Buried deep below his knees. Still the Snow passed; deeper down In the snow sank Drowsietown. Not a bird stayed, big or small, Not a team could stir at all. Round the cottage window-frame Barking foxes nightly came, Scowling in a spectral ring At the ghostly glimmering. Old Abe Sinker at the Inn Heap'd his fire up with a grin, For the great room, warm and bright, Never emptied morn or night. Old folks shiver'd with their bones Full of pains and cold as stones. Nought was doing, nought was done, From the rise to set of sun. Yawning in the ale-house heat, Shivering in the snowy street, Like dream-shadows, up and down, With their footprints black below, Moved the folk of Drowsietown, In the Year of the Great Snow! II. The Wanderer. Snowing and blowing, roaring and rattle, Frost, snow, and wind are all busy at battle! O what a quaking, and shaking, and calling, Whitely, so whitely, the snow still is falling; Stone-dead the earth is, shrouded all over, White, stiff, and hard is the snow-sheet above her, Deep, deep the drift is; and tho' it is snowing, Blacker, yet blacker, the heavens are growing. Oh, what a night! gather nearer the fire! Pile the warm pine-logs higher and higher; Shut the black storm out, close tight the shutters, Hark! how without there it moans and it mutters, Tearing with teeth, claws, and fingers tremendous, Roof, wall, and gable!—now Angels defend us! There was a roar!—how it crashes and darkens! No wonder that Phœbe stops, trembles, and hearkens. For black as the skies are, tho' hueless and ghastly, Stretches the wold, 'mid the snow falling fastly, Here in the homestead by Phœbe made cosy, All is so pleasant, so ruddy, and rosy. All by herself in the tile-paven kitchen, In white huswife's gown, and in apron bewitching, Flits little Phœbe, so busily making Corn bread and rye bread for Saturday's baking. See! in the firelight that round her is gleaming, How she is glowing, and glancing, and beaming, While all around her, in sheer perspiration Of an ecstatic and warm admiration, Plates, cups, and dishes, delightedly glowing, Watch her sweet shade as 'tis coming and going, Catch her bright image as lightly she passes, Shine it about in plates, dishes, and glasses! Often in wonder all trembling and quaking, To feel how the homestead is swaying and shaking, All in a clatter they cry out together, ‘The roof will be off in a minute! What weather!’ . . . . A face in the darkness, a foot on the Snow, I it there? Dost thou hear? Doth it come? Doth it go? Hush! only the gusts as they gather and grow. O Phœbe is busy!—with little flour'd fingers, Like rosebuds in snow, o'er her labour she lingers; And oft when the tumult is loudest she listens, Her eyes are intent, and her pretty face glistens So warm in the firelight. Despite the storm's crying, Sound, sound in their slumbers the farm-maids are lying; The clock with its round face perspiring and blinking, Is pointing to bed-time, and sleepily winking. The sheep-dog lies basking, the grey cat is purring, Only the tempest is crying and stirring. The minutes creep on, and the wind still is busy, And Phœbe still hearkens, perplex'd, and uneasy. . . . . A face in the wold where the snowdrift lies low. A footfall by night?—or the winds as they blow? O hush! it comes nearer, a foot on the Snow. Phœbe's fond heart is beginning to flutter, She harks for a footfall, a tap on the shutter; She lists for a voice while the storm gathers shriller, The drift's at the door, and the frost groweth chiller. She looks at the clock, and she starteth back sighing, While the cuckoo leaps out from his hole in it, crying His name ten times over; past ten, little singer! ‘O what keeps Eureka? and where can he linger?’ The snow is so deep, and the ways are so dire, She thinks; and a footfall comes nigher and nigher. . . . . A face in the darkness, a face full of woe, A face and a footfall—they come and they go, Still nearer and nearer—a foot on the Snow! Eureka's abroad in the town,—but 'tis later Than Drowsietown's bed-time. Still greater and greater The fears of poor Phœbe each moment are growing; And sadder and paler her features are glowing. She steps to the door—lifts the latch—with wild scolding The door is dashed open, and torn from her holding, While shivering she peers on the blackness, vibrating With a trouble of whiteness within it pulsating! The wind piles the drift at the threshold before her, The snow swarms upon her, around her, and o'er her, But melts on the warmth of her face and her hands. A moment in trouble she hearkens and stands. All black and all still, save the storm's wild tabor! And she closes the door, and comes back to her labour. In vain—she grows paler—her heart sinks within her, The cuckoo bursts out in a flutter (the sinner), And chimes the half-hour—she sits now awaiting, Her heart forebodes evil, her mind still debating; The drift is so deep—could a false step within it Have led to his grave in one terrible minute? Could his foot have gone wand'ring away in the wold there, While frozen and feeble he sank in the cold there? 'Tis his foot! . . . Nay, not yet! . . . There he's tapping, to summon His wife to the door! Nay, indeed, little woman!. 'Tis his foot at the door!—and he listens to hear her! Nay, not yet; yet a footfall there is, coming nearer. A face in the darkness, a foot on the Snow, Nearer it comes to the warm window-glow; O hush! thro' the wind, a foot-fall on the Snow. Now heark, Phœbe, heark!—But she hearks not; for dreaming, Her soft eyes are fixed on the fire's rosy gleaming; Hands crossed on her knees she rocks to and fro; O heark! Phœbe, heark! 'tis a foot on the Snow. O heark! Phœbe, heark! and flit over the floor, 'Tis a foot on the Snow! 'tis a tap at the door! Low, faint as hail tapping. . . Upstarting, she hearkens. It ceases. The firelight sinks low, the room darkens. She listens again. All is still. The wind blowing, The thrill of the tempest, the sound of the snowing. Hush again! something taps—a low murmur is heard. ‘Come in,’ Phœbe cries; but the latch is not stirred. Her heart's failing fast; superstitious and mute She stands and she trembles, and stirs not a foot. She hears a low breathing, a moaning, a knock, Between the wind's cry and the tick of the clock: Tap! tap! . . with an effort she shakes off her fear, Makes one step to the door; again pauses to hear. The latch stirs; in terror and desperate haste She opens the door, shrinking back pallidfaced, And sees at the porch, with a thrill of affright, 'Mid the gleaming of snow and the darkness of night, A shape like a Woman's, a tremulous form White with the snow-flakes and bent with the storm! Great eyes looking out through a black tatter'd hood, With a gleam of wild sorrow that thrills through the blood, A hand that outreaches, a voice sadly strung, That speaks to her soul in some mystical tongue! The face in the darkness, the foot on the Snow, They have come, they are here, with their weal and their woe: O long was the journey! the wayfarer slow! Now Phœbe hath courage, for plainly the being She looks on is mortal, though wild to the seeing— Tall, spectral, and strange, yet in sorrow so human— And the eyes, though so wild, are the eyes of a woman. Her face is all hid; but her brow and her hands, And the quaint ancient cloak that she wears as she stands, Are those of the red race who still wander scatter'd— The gipsies of white towns, dishonour'd, drink-shatter'd. And strange, too, she seems by her tongue; yet her words are As liquid and soft as the notes of a bird are. All this in a moment sees Phœbe; then lo! She sees the shape staggering in from the snow, Revealing, as in to the fire-gleam she goes, A face wild with famine, and haggard with woes, For her hood falls away, and her head glimmers bare, And loosen'd around falls her dank dripping hair, And her eyes gleam like death—she would fall to the earth, But the soft little hands of kind Phœbe reach forth, And lead her, half swooning, half conscious, until She sinks in a chair by the fire and is still; Still, death-like,—while Phœbe kneels down by her chair, And chafes her chill hands with a motherly care. The face is upon her, it gleams in the glow, She hears a voice warning, still dreadful and low, Far back lies the footprint, a track in the Snow. The woman was ghost-like, yet wondrously fair Through the gray cloud of famine, the dews of despair, Her face hunger'd forth—'twas a red woman's face, Without the sunk eyeball, the taint of the race; With strange gentle lines round the mouth of her, cast By moments of being too blissful to last. Her cloak fallen wide, as she sat there distraught, Revealed a strange garment with figures enwrought In silk and old beads—it had once been most bright— But frayed with long wearing by day and by night. Mocassins she wore, and they, too, had been gay, And now they were ragged and rent by the way; And bare to the cold was one foot, soft and red, And frozen felt both, and one trickled and bled. The face of the stranger, 'tis worn with its woe, It comes to thee, Phœbe, but when shall it go? Far back go the footprints; see! black in the Snow. But look! what is that? lo! it lies on her breast, A small living creature, an infant at rest! So tiny, so shrivell'd, a mite of red clay, Warm, mummied, and wrapt in the Indian way. It opens its eyes, and it shrivels red cheeks; It thrusts out its hand to the face, and it speaks With a cry to the heart of the mother; and lo! She stirs from her swoon, and her famish'd cheeks glow, She rolls her wild eyes at the cry of distress, And her weak hands instinctively open her dress That the babe may be fed; and the touch of the child When it comes to her bosom, warm, milky, and mild, Seems blissful—she smiles—O, so faintly! —is blest To feel its lips draw at the poor weary breast. She closes her eyes, she is soothed, and her form Within the great firelight grows happy and warm. She hears not the wind, and she seems in a dream, Till her orbs startle open amid the glad gleam; Her looks fall on Phœbe, who trembles for pity; She holds out her hands with a cry of entreaty; Her thoughts flow together—she knows the bright place, She feels the sweet firelight, she sees the kind face— For Phœbe unloosens her poor dripping cloak, And its damp rises up in the kitchen like smoke; And Phœbe, with tender and matronly grace, Is wiping the snow and the wet from her face. She looks, sinks again, speaks with quick birdlike cries, In her own thrilling speech; but her voice breaks and dies, And her tears, through shut eyelids, ooze slowly and blindly On the white little hands that are touching her kindly. A face in the darkness, a face full of woe, Deep, deep, are the white ways, and bleak the winds blow; O, long was the journey, the wayfarer slow, O, look! black as death, stretch the prints in the Snow. III. Retrospect: the Journey. A footprint—trace it back. O God! The bleeding feet, the weary road. Fly, Fancy, as the eagle flies, With beating heart and burning eyes, Fly on the north-wind's breath of power, Beat mile by mile, and hour by hour, Southward, still southward: shouldst thou tire, Rest with the solar sphere of fire, Then rise again and take thy flight Across the continent in white, And track, still track, as thou dost go This bleeding footprint in the snow! Fly night by night, or day by day, Count the long hours, watch the wild way; Then see, beneath thee sailing swift The white way melteth, and the drift Gathers no longer; and instead Of snow a dreary rain is shed, On grassy ways, on dreary leas, And sullen pools that do not freeze. Now must thy keen eye look more near To trace the bloody footprint here; But see! still see! it can be traced On the wet pastures of the waste; On! on, still on! still southward sail, While tall trees shake in the shrill gale, And great streams gather, and things green Begin to show thro' the dim sheen. Here thro' a mighty wood the track Errs like a silk thread slowly back, And here birds singing go and come, Tho' far away the world is dumb. A river, and the track is lost. But when the stream is safely cross'd Again, upon the further brim, The drop of blood, the footprint dim! O wingëd thought, o'er half a world Thou sailest with great wings unfurl'd, From white to dark, from dark to bright, From north to south, thou takest flight, Passing with constant waft of wing From winter climes to climes of spring, Swiftly thou goest, and still thy gaze Follows the footprint thro' wild ways; Swiftly thou speedest south—O God! A thousand leagues of weary road! A thousand leagues! O see, the track, Clear to the soul's eye, wavers back Dim yet unbroken, linking slow Winter with spring, sunshine with snow, The dead leaf with the leaf still blowing, The frozen stream with the stream flowing; Linking and binding silently Forgetfulness with memory, Love living with love long at rest, A burning with a frozen breast, A Sunbeam Soul all light and seeing With a mere Beaver of a being. Turn back, my Spirit, turn and trace The woman from her starting place, Whence with fix'd features and feet free She plunged into the world's great Sea,— A fair sweet swimmer, strong of limb, Most confident in God, and him, And found herself by wild winds blown, In a great waste, alone, alone! Long with the patience of her race, Had Red Rose waited for the face That came not, listen'd for the voice That made her soul leap and rejoice. They came not: all was still. For days, She like a fawn in the green ways Wander'd alone; and night by night She watch'd heaven's eye of liquid light With eyes as luminous as theirs, 'Mid tremulous sighs and panted prayers. He came not: all was still: her tread Grew heavier on the earth, her head Hung sadder, and her weeping eyes Look'd more on earth than on the skies: Like a dead leaf she droop'd in woe, Until one day, with a quick throe, She turn'd to crimson as she wept, And lo! within her something leapt! Flesh of her flesh, the blossom broke, Blood of her blood, she felt it stir, Within her life another woke With still small eyes, and look'd at her! And with a strange ecstatic pain, She breathed, and felt it breathe again. She seem'd to see it night and day, Coming along from far away Down a green path, and with fierce flame She rush'd to meet it as it came, But as she rush'd the shape did seem Suddenly to dissolve in dream, And daily she stood hungering sore, Till far off it arose once more. But as the life within her grew A horror took away her breath, Lest when her cruel kinsmen knew Her secret, they should deal her death. For now the aged Chief, with whom Her happy life had broke to bloom, Along the dark deep path had wound That leads to God's great hunting-ground; And a young brave of the red band Was proudly wooing for her hand;— Not in white fashion fervently, Not with wild vows and on his knee; Rather a proud majestic wooer Who felt his suit an honour to her, And who his formal presents sent In calm assumption of consent, And never dream'd the maid would dare To turn her tender eyes elsewhere;— Nor dared she openly disdain A suit so solemn and so plain; But with a smile half agonized She (as we whites say) temporized! She found two friendly women, who, Tho' hags in form, were kind and true, And with their aid, when the hour came, She bare her child and hid her shame. As Eve bare Cain, upon a bed Of balsam and of hemlock, spread By those kind hands, in the deep woods, Amid the forest solitudes, With myriad creatures round her flying, And every creature multiplying; In the warm greenwood, hid from sight, She held her babe to the glad light, And brighten'd. As she linger'd there, She had a dream most sadly fair: She seem'd upon a river-side, Gazing across a crystal tide, And o'er the tide in dying swells There came a burthen as of bells Out of a mist; then the mist clear'd, And on the further bank appear'd A dim shape fondly beckoning— Her warrior tall, her heart's white King! She cried, and woke; the dream was nought; But ever after her wild thought Yearn'd with an instinct mad and dumb To seek him, since he did not come. She thought, ‘My warrior beckons me! He would be here if he were free. And if I stay my kinsmen wild Will surely slay me and the child; But there, with him in that fair place, Where he is chief of his own race, All will be well; for he is good, Of milder race and gentler blood; And tho' I die upon the way 'Twill not be worse than if I stay, Butcher'd and shamed in all men's sight When my sad secret comes to light. 'Tis well! this paper in my hand Will guide my footsteps thro' the land, And when I strengthen I will fly, And I will find my lord, or die!’ 'Twas thought, 'twas done; at dead of night, She clasp'd her infant and took flight. One guide she had—the luminous star, On the horizon line afar; For thither oft Eureka's hand Had pointed, telling her his land Lay thitherward: gazing thereon, That night she busied to be gone, It seem'd a lamp that he had placed To guide her footsteps o'er the waste. She gather'd food, then to her back Attach'd the babe, and took the track. Waving her hands in wild ‘adieu’ To those kind women dark of hue, Who crouching on a dark ascent Moan'd low, and watch'd her as she went. There shone the star liquid and clear, His voice seem'd calling in her ear, The night was warm as her desire, And forth she fled on feet of fire. One guide; she had another too: A crumpled paper coarse to view, Wherein she had kept with tender care A little lock of precious hair, And on the paper this was written plain: ‘Eureka Hart, Drowsietown, State of Maine.’ O poor dark bird, nought still knew she Of this wild world's geography! Less than the swallow sailing home, Less than the petrel 'mid the foam, Less than the mallard winging fast, O'er solitary fens and vast, To seek his birthplace far away In regions of the midnight day. She only knew that somewhere there, In some strange land afar or near, Under that star serene and fair, He waited; and her soul could hear His summons; even as a dove Her soul's wild pinions she unfurl'd, And sought in constancy and love Her only refuge in the world! A footprint—trace it on!— For days Her path was on great pasture ways: League after league of verdurous bloom Of star-like flowers and faint perfume, And from her coming leapt in fear The antelope and dappled deer; And everywhere around her grew Ripe fruit and berries that she knew, While glistening in the golden gleam Glanced many a mere and running stream. A happy land of flocks and herds, And many-colour'd water-birds! Oft, sailing with her as she went, The eagle eddied indolent On soft swift wing; and with his wild Dark dewy eye glanced at her child, Nor till she scream'd and arms upthrew, Turn'd, and on sullen wing withdrew. But sweet it was by night to rest And give her little babe the breast, And O each night with eyes most dim She felt one night more near to him: And all the pains of the past day, With all the perils of the way, Seem'd as a dream; and lo! afar She saw the smiling of the Star. 'Twere but a weary task to trace Her footprint on from place to place, From day to day; to sing and tell What daily accidents befell, What dangers threaten'd her, what eyes Watch'd her go by in wild surprise, What prospects blest her, where and when She look'd on life and met with men. Enough to say, tho' light and dark, Straight, as an arrow to its mark, The woman flew; wise in the ways Of her own race, she hid from gaze When flitting forms against the sky Warn'd her that Indians might be nigh; And when the wild beast dreadful-eyed Approach'd her, with shrill shriek she cried, Until the bloody coward shook Before the red rage of her look. And tho' the prospect changed all days, It did not change to her; whose gaze Saw these things only: the white star On the horizon line afar, And the quick beckoning of a hand Out of another, sweeter land. The long sad road—the way so dreary The very Fancy falters weary! The very soul is dazed, and shows Only a gleam of wild tableaux: In midst of each that shape of woe Still straggling northward—slow, slow, slow. . . . A river deep. She cannot find A wading-place to suit her mind; But on the bank sets quietly, Amid the sunflowers tall as she, Her little babe: then slips her dress And stands in mother-nakedness; Then in a bundle on her head She ties her raiment yellow and red, And swimming o'er the waters bright, With glistening limbs of liquid light, Sets down her burden dry, and then, With swift stroke sailing back again, Seeks the small babe where it doth lie, And with her right hand holds it high, While with the other slow she swims, Trailing her large and liquid limbs; Then dripping wades to the far shore, And clothes her loveliness once more . . . . . . On a lone plain she now is found, Where troglodytes dwell underground. Wild settlers peering from their caves, Like dead men moving in their graves, Rise round her as she comes, and glare With hungry eyes thro' horrent hair; But they are gentle, and they give Herbs and black bread that she may live, And in their caves the weary one Rests till the rising of the sun; Then the wild shapes around her stand Reading the paper in her hand, And point her northward; and she flies Fleet-footed, while with wandering eyes They stand and watch her shape fade dim Across the dark horizon-rim . . . . . . She stands on a great river's bank, 'Mid noxious weeds and sedges dank; And on the yellow river's track, Jagged with teeth like snags jet black, The ferryman in his great boat, A speck on the broad waste, doth float, Approaching to the water's side, But lengthways drifting with the tide. She leaps into the boat, and o'er The waste to the dark further shore, Slowly they journey; as he rows The paper to the man she shows, Who reads; and as she springs to land, He too points northward with his hand . . . . . . See, with a crimson glare of light, A log-town burneth in the night! And flying forth with all their goods Into the sandy solitudes, The people wild, with bloodless cheeks, Glare at a wanderer who speaks In a strange tongue; but as they fly Are dumb, and answer not her cry . . . . . . Now thro' a land by the red sun Scorch'd as with fire, the lonely one Treads slowly; and ere long she hears The sharp cry of shrill overseers, Driving black gangs that toiling tramp Thro' cotton fields and sugar swamp. Here first the hand of man is raised To harm her—for with eyes amazed She nears a City, and is cast Into a slave-pen foul and vast, Seized as an Ethiop slave. From thence She in an agony intense Is thrust; but not ere eager eyes Have mark'd her beauty as a prize. But God is good, and one blest day She hears upon the burning way An aged half-caste burnt and black Speak in her tongue and answer back. These twain wring hands upon the road, And in the stranger's poor abode She sleeps that night; but with the sun She wakens, and is pointed on . . . . . . Now in a waggon great she lies, And shaded from the brazen skies, Slowly she jogs, and all at rest She gives her little babe the breast. Happy she rests; hears in her dream The driver's song, the jingling team. With jet black cheek and bright red lip, The negro drives and cracks his whip, Singing plantation hymns to God, And grinning greetings with a nod . . . . . . Now, toiling on a dusty way, She begs her bread from day to day, And some are good to her and mild, And most are soften'd by the child. Once, as she halts at a great door, Hungry and weary, sick and sore, A lovely lady white as milk Glides past her in her rustling silk; Then pauses, questioning, and sees The sleeping babe upon her knees, And takes the paper from her hand, And reading it doth understand; Then stoops to kiss the child with cold Kind lips, and gives the mother gold . . . . . . Now in a mighty boat, among A crowd of people strange of tongue, She saileth slow, with wandering sight, On a vast river day and night; All day the prospect drifteth past— Swamp, wood, and meadow, fading fast,— With lonely huts, and shapes that stand On the stream's bank, and wave the hand; All night with eyes that look aloft, Or close in sleep, she sails; but oft The blackness takes a deeper frown, And the wild eyeballs of a town Flash open as the boat goes by, And she awakens with a cry . . . On, on, and on—O the blind quest, The throbbing heart, the aching breast! And O the faith, more steadfast far Then aught on earth, or any star; The faith that never ceased to shine, The strength of constancy divine, The will that warm'd her as she went Across a mighty continent, Unknown, scarce help'd, from land to land, With that poor paper in her hand! The vision falls. The figure fades Amid the lonely forest glades, Fringing the mightly inland seas. I see her still; and still she flees Onward, still onward; tho' the wind Blows cold, and nature looks unkind: The dead leaves fall and rot; the chill Damp earth-breath clings to vale and hill, The birds are sailing south; and hark! As she fares onward thro' the dark, The honking wild geese swiftly sail Amid a slowly gathering gale. All darkens; and around her flow The cold and silence of the Snow. There she is lost; in that white gleam She fadeth, let her fade, in dream! Poor bird of the bright summer, now She feels the kisses on her brow Of Frost and Fog; and at her back Another Shadow keeps the track. 'Tis winter now; and birds have flown Southward, to seek a gladder zone; One, only one, doth northward fare, And dreams to find her summer there. God help her! look not! let her go Into the realm of the Great Snow! IV. The Journey's End. Back in a swoon, with haggard face, Falleth the woman of wild race, Dumb, cold as stone, her weary eyes Fix'd as in very death she lies— While little Phœbe trembling stands, Wetting her lips, chafing her hands, Trembling, almost afraid to stir For wonder, as she looks at her: So weird, so wild a shape, she seems Like some sad spirit seen in dreams; Beauteous of face beyond belief, And yet so worn with want and grief. The clock ticks low within. Without The wind still wanders with shrill shout. The cuckoo strikes the hour—midnight! And Phœbe starteth in affright. ‘O what can keep Eureka still?’ She thinks, and listens with a thrill For his foot's sound. It doth not come. The clock ticks low. All else is dumb. And still the woman lieth there, Down drooping in the great arm-chair, With hanging hands, chin on her breast, And 'neath her cloak the babe at rest. She doth not breathe, she doth not moan. But lieth like a thing of stone. ‘O God,’ thinks Phœbe, deadly white, ‘If she be dead!’ and faint with fright, Chafeth the fingers marble cold That seem to stiffen in her hold. She cannot stir, she cannot move, To wake the maids who sleep above; Her heart is fluttering in its fear, ‘Eureka! O that he were here!’ [He hurries not! Perchance some sense Of danger may detain him hence. He would not hasten, if he knew The curious sight he has to view. Few mortal husbands, red or white, Would care to wear his shoes this night.] ‘What can she be?’ thinks little Phœbe, ‘Some Indian tramp—a beggar maybe— And yet she's got a different mien To such of these as I have seen. Her face is like a babe's—she's young, And she can speak no other tongue Than Indian. When she spoke her words Came like the gurgling notes of birds. Poor thing! and out on such a night, When all the world is wild and white With the Great Snow. And O, to see The little babe upon her knee! I wonder now, if I should take it From her cold bosom, I should wake it— Poor little child!’ And as she spake Those words she saw the baby wake, Sweet-smiling in the fire's red streaks, With beaded eyes and rosy cheeks. Then Phœbe started. ‘Why,’ thought she, ‘The babe is near as fair as me! With just one dark flush on its face To show the taint of Indian race. That's strange! Poor little outcast mite! I guess his father's skin is white.’ Then, for a moment, Phœbe's mien Wore an expression icy-keen, As now in scrutiny amazed The sleeping woman's hand she raised, And dropt it quickly, murmuring— ‘She is no wife! she wears no ring!’ So for a space her features took Pure matronhood's Medusa-look,— That look, so pitiless and lawful, Which oft makes little women awful; And which weak women, when they fall, Dread in their sisters worst of all! But bless thee, Phœbe, soon the child Soften'd thy face and made it mild; To see it lie so bright and pretty, Thy woman's eyes were moist for pity, And soon thy tears began to flow— ‘Poor soul! and out in the Great Snow!’ E'en as she spake the stranger stirr'd. The cold lips trembled with no word. The fingers quiver'd, the great eyes Open'd in stupefied surprise, A deep sigh tore her lips apart, And with a thickly-throbbing heart She gazed around. The ruddy light, The cosy kitchen warm and bright, The clock's great shining face, the human Soft kindly eyes of the white woman, Came like a dream—her eyes she closed A moment with a moan, and dozed. Then suddenly her soul was 'ware Of the wild quest that brought her there! She open'd eyes—a flush of red Flash'd to her cheeks so chill and dead— She murmur'd quick with quivering lips, And, trembling to the finger tips, Thrust her chill hand into her breast, Under the ragged cloak, in quest Of something precious hidden there!— 'Tis safe,—she draws it forth with care; A wretched paper, torn and wet, Thumb-mark'd with touch of many a hand, 'Tis there-'tis safe—she has it yet, Her heart's sole guide, the amulet, That led her lone feet thro' the land! But first, unto her lips of ice She holds it eagerly, and thrice She kisses it; then, with wild eyes And unintelligible cries, Holds it to Phœbe. ‘Read!’ cries she, In her own tongue, distractedly; And little Phœbe understands, And takes the paper in her hands, And on the hearth she stoopeth low, To read it in the firelight glow. Now courage, Phœbe! steel thy spirit! A blow is coming—thou must beat it! Slowly, so vilely it is writ, Her unskill'd eyes decipher it; So worn it is with snow and rain, That scarce a letter now is plain, And every red and ragged mark Is smudged with handling, dim, and dark. ‘E-U-R-E’—in letters blurr'd She spells. ‘Eureka!’ that's the word. But why does little Phœbe start As she reads on? ‘Eureka Hart!’— His name, her husband's name; and now The red blood flames on cheek and brow! She stops—she quivers—glares wild-eyed At the red woman at her side, Who watches her with one sick gaze Of wild entreaty and amaze: Then she spells on—her features turn To marble, though her bright eyes burn, For all the bitter truth grows plain. ‘Eureka Hart, Drowsietown, State of Maine.’ First lightning flash of fierce surprise! It burns her cheek, and blinds her eyes Again she looks on the strange creature's Tall, ragged form and beauteous features. Next lightning flash, and muffled thunder— ‘The baby's skin is white—no wonder!’ And she perceives, as plain as may be, All the event—down to the baby! Last flash, the whole dark mystery lighting,— ‘Why, it's Eureka's own handwriting!’ Ay, little wife!—and these dim stains Are life-blood from Eureka's veins; In blood the words were writ by him, And see! how faded and how dim! The woman took her hand. She shook The touch away with tiger-look, And trembling gazed upon her. So. She stagger'd underneath the blow, Watch'd by the stranger's luminous eyes In mingled stupor and surprise; Ah! little did the stranger guess The situation's bitterness, But in her own wild tongue did say, ‘Where is my love? show me the way!’ A hand upon the latch. Both start,— The door swings wide—the drift sweeps in. Footsteps: and lo! Eurcka Hart, Snow-cover'd, muffled to the chin. V. Face to Face. Warmly muffled to the chin there, Blind with snow-drift, stamping, waiting, Dazzled by the light within there, Stood the giant oscillating. Then he closed the door, and turning His great back against it, smiled! Slightly tipsy, not discerning The red woman and her child. By the great eyes dimly blinking, Feebly leering at his mate, Phœbe saw he had been drinking, While he hiccup'd, ‘Guess I'm late!’ So he stood; when, wildly ringing, Rose a scream upon the air, 'Twas the Indian woman, springing, Gasping, gazing, from her chair. Round her face the black hair raining To her heart the baby straining, Gasping, gazing, half believing 'Twas some phantom soul-deceiving, Bound as by a spell she linger'd, Pointing at him fiery-finger'd; And the giant mighty-jointed, Groan'd and stagger'd as she pointed, Thinking, while his heart beat quicker, 'Twas some phantom born of liquor! . . . While he rubb'd his eyes and mutter'd, While he roll'd his eyes distress'd, O'er the floor a thin form flutter'd, Cried, and sank upon his breast! Phœbe screams. Stagger'd and blinded, Stands the creature beaver-minded, While upon his heart reposes Cheeks he knows full well—Red Rose's! Half repulsing and half holding, While her arms are round him folding, Gaunt he stands in pain afflicted, An impostor self-convicted! While her great eyes, upward-looking, Not reproaching, not rebuking, Trusting, loving, lustre-pouring, Happy now, and still adoring, Burn on his; and her dark passion Masters her in the old fashion, Thrills the frail thin figure, burning With a lightning flash of yearning, Lights the worn cheeks and the faded Forehead with her dark locks shaded, Thrills, transfigures, seems to lend her All the soul of her old splendour;— So that all the rags upon her, All the anguish and dishonour, All the weary days of wandering, All the weeping, plaining, pondering, All the sorrow, all the striving Ne'er a man could face surviving, All the Past, burns iridescent In one Rainbow of the Present. See! she feasts on every feature Madly, like a famish'd creature, Reads each line in rapture, reeling With the frantic bliss of feeling; Kindling now her arms are round him, Murmuring madly, she hath found him, He is folded close unto her, And the bliss of God thrills thro' her! Her white Chief, whom God had brought her From the shining Big Sea Water, Her great Chief of the pale races, With wise tongues and paintless faces! More than mortal in her seeing, Glorious, grand, a god-like being! Nor, tho' Phœbe stands there, looking Most distractedly rebuking, Doth this child of the red nation Comprehend the situation! Not a thought hath she to move her, Save that all the quest is over! He is living, he is near her, Grander, greater, braver, dearer! No reproach in her fixed gaze is While her eyes to his she raises— Only hungering and thirsting Of a heart with pleasure bursting; Only a supreme sensation Of ecstatic admiration, Melting in one soul-flush splendid Years of heart-ache past and ended. Her white Warrior, her fair Master! Hers, all hers, despite disaster! Hers, her own, that she may cry for, Cling to, smile to, trust in, die for! Is she blind? Hath the glad wonder Struck her to the soul and stunn'd her? Sees she not on every feature The sick horror of the creature? Sober now, and looking ghastly, Trembling while his breath comes fastly, With the cold sweat on his forehead, Shrinking as from something horrid, Paralysed with guilt, despairing, Not at her but Phœbe glaring, Speechless, helpless, and aghast, Stands the giant, pinion'd fast. Yes, her eyes are blindly gleaming Thro' the warm tears wildly streaming— Yes, her soul is blind (God guide her!); Hunger, thirst, and grief have tried her, She is feeble, not perceiving Cause for bitterness or grieving; She is foolish, never guessing That her visit is distressing, She is mad, mad, mad, presuming He has waited for her coming! No, she will not see the horror Fate hath been preparing for her— All the little strength remaining She will wildly spend in straining, In a rapturous confusion, To her breast the old delusion. Hark! her lips speak, words are springing Like the notes of a bird singing, Like a fountain sunward throbbing With a silvern song of sobbing; Not a word is clear, but all Rise in rapture, blend, and fall! Suddenly the rapture falters, Her hands loosen, her face alters, Drawing from him softly, quickly, While he staggers white and sickly, She, with grace beyond all beauty, Doth her ragged cloak unloose, Then, with looks of loving duty, Shows Eureka—the papoose! Tiny, pink-cheek'd, blushing brightly, Like a mummy roll'd up tightly; Puffing cheeks, and fat hands spreaning The Printer's Devil queries this, but he does not know the Old Poets. See(e.g.) Michael Drayton's Moses' Birth and Miracles—‘And spreans the pretty hands.’ In an ecstasy unmeaning; Blinking, his pink cheeks in gathers, With blue eyes just like his father's! In his pretty face already Just the image of his daddy! Stolid, stretching hands to pat him, Lies the baby, smiling at him! Still stands little Phœbe, panting, This, and only this, was wanting; Now, with all her courage rallied, She between them—panting, pallid— Stands; and, keen-eyed as an eagle, Tho' as fluttering as a linnet, Folds her virtue, like a regal Robe, around her; frowning in it. Yet so wildly doth she flutter, Not a sentence can she utter; Stately, speechless, with eyes blazing, Stands the little White Rose, gazing! Suddenly, with acclamation, On that group of desperation Bursts the Storm!—With one wild rattle Of the elements at battle, With one horrid roar and yelling, Tearing, tugging at the dwelling, Strikes the Wind; the latch is lifted, With a crash wide swings the door; In the blinding Snow is drifted, With a melancholy roar! 'Tis the elements of Nature Flocking round the weary creature, Crying to her, while they blind her, ‘Come to us! for we are kinder! Cross the cruel, fatal portal Of the miserable mortal; Come, our hands are cold but loving! Back into the midnight moving, In some spot of silence creeping, Find a quiet place for sleeping. We, the Winds, will dig it straightway, Far beyond the white man's gateway. I, the Snow, will place above it My soft cheek, and never move it; With my beauty, white and chilly, Lying o'er thee like a lily, Dress'd for sleep in snowy clothing Thou shalt slumber, hearing nothing. We will freeze thine ears from hearing His hard foot when it is nearing; We will close thine ears from conning His that look upon thee shunning. We will keep thee, we will guard thee, Till the kiss of God reward thee. Come, O come!’ Thus, unavailing, Sounds the elemental wailing. Peace, O Winds, your weary voices Teach her nothing: she rejoices! Hush, O Snow, let your chill hands not Touch her cheek; she understands not; Hush! But God, who is that other, Standing beckoning unto her? Winds and Snows, 'tis your pale brother, And his chilly breath thrills thro' her. Ay, the Shadow there is looming Thro' the tempest and the glooming! O'er each path her feet have chosen— Mountains, valleys, rivers frozen; Creeping near, with eyes that glisten When her cold foot flagg'd, to listen; As a bloodhound, ever flitting, Night-time, day-time, never quitting; Sure of scent, with thin foot trailing In the snowdrift, never failing, He has follow'd follow'd slow, That red footprint in the Snow! Now he finds her white and wan,— 'Tis the Winter, Peboan. See the American-Indian Mythology. ‘Peboan’ is the personification of extreme Cold. Spare her! Who would bid him spare her? Let him trance her and upbear her In his arms, and softly place her Where no cruel foot can trace her. Let her die! See, his eyes con her, And his icy hand is on her; Thro' her form runs the quick shiver, Light as leaves her eyelids quiver, And with quick, spasmodic touches, The belovèd form she clutches; From the cruelty of man, Take her gently, Peboan! Phœbe shivers. To her reaching, With an agony beseeching, Red Rose holds the babe; one moment, With a shrug of bitter comment, Phœbe shrinks; then, being human, Frighten'd, thinking Death is there, Quietly the little woman Takes the burden unaware. Not a breath too soon; for, rocking In the roaring of the storm, With the snow flakes round her flocking, And the wild wind round her form, With a cry of anguish, prone Falls the wanderer, cold as stone! VI. Pauguk. O poor Red Rose! rent by the storm! The flame still flickered in her form. Moveless she lay; but in her breast The tumult was not quite at rest They raised her up, and, with soft tread, They bore her slowly to a bed. And little Phœbe's heart did ache, Despite her wrongs, for pity's sake; And little Phœbe's own kind hands (God bless them!) loos'd the wand'rer's bands, Took softly off the dripping dress, With eyes that wept for kindliness, Wrung the wet hair, and smoothed it right, And clad the Red Rose all in white. There, all in white, on a white bed, The Red Rose hung her heavy head. Around her was a roar, a gleam, And she was struggling in a dream. Faces round her went and came, Her great eyes flash'd with fading flame. For all the time, fever'd and sore, She did her journey yet once more; Once again her Soul's feet trod The pathless wild, the weary road; Once again she sail'd along The mighty meres and rivers strong; Once again, with weary tread, She stagger'd on, and begged her bread; Once again she falter'd slow Into the realm of the Great Snow. Oh, the roaring in her brain! Oh, the wild winds that moan again! Against her, as she clasps her child, The hail is driven, the drift is piled. She sees a light that shines afar; It beckons her—a hand, a Star. She hears a voice afar away; It calls to her; she must not stay. Around her clouds of tempest roll, And, oh! the storm within her soul! But now and then, amid the snow, There comes a silence and a glow; And white she lies, in a white room, And some one watches in the gloom. Close by the bed where she doth rest, Sits, with the babe upon her breast, A little woman, waiting there, Despite her wrongs, so kind, so fair! E'en as she wakens, wild and weak, Red Rose sits up, and tries to speak, And reaching out, with a thin moan, She takes a white hand in her own; But swoons once more, and hears again The tempest roaring in her brain! Now as she dreams, with fever'd cries, Phœbe looks on with quiet eyes; And Phœbe and her maidens go Softly and lightly to and fro. Downstairs by the great fire of wood, Alone, Eureka Hart doth brood; And when his little wife descends He scowls, and eyes his finger-ends. She scarcely looks into his face, But orders him about the place; And at her will he flies full meek, With red confusion on his cheek. Her eyes are swoll'n with tears; to him Her face is pitiless and grim. But as she reascends the stairs Her pale cheek flushes unawares. In pity half, and half in scorn, She sees again that shape forlorn. She cannot love her; yet her heart Flutters, and takes the wand'rer's part. Her thoughts are angry, weak and wild, Yet carefully she tends the child. Often she prays, with heart astir, The white man's God to strengthen her. And thus, despite her heart's distress, She doth a deed of blessedness. Silent for days by that bedside She waiteth, watching, weary-eyed: Not all alone; by her unseen, Sitteth another, strange of mien. He squatteth in the corner there, And looketh on through his thin hair. Clad in fantastic Indian weeds, With calumet and skirt of beads, Gaunt, haggard, hungry, woebegone, Waiteth Pauguk, In the same mythology, Pauguk is, as represented in the poem, the Indian spirit of Death. the Skeleton! For wintry Peboan hath fled, Leaving this shadow in his stead. And there he waits, unseen, unheard; And as a serpent on a bird Fixeth his glittering gaze, Pauguk Watcheth the bed with hungry look. VII. The Melting of the Snow. A sound of streamlets flowing, flowing; A cry of winds so bleakly blowing; A stir, a tumult ever growing; Deep night; and the Great Snow was going. Underneath her death-shroud thick, Like a body buried quick, Heaved the Earth, and thrusting hands Crack's the ice and brake her bands. Heaven, with face of watery woe, Watched the resurrection grow. All the night, bent to be free, In a sickening agony, Struggled Earth. With silent tread From his cold seat at her head Rose the Frost, and northward stole To his cavern near the pole. When the bloodshot eyes of Morn Opened in the east forlorn, 'Twas a dreary sight to see Blotted waste and watery lea, All the beautiful white plains Blurr'd with black'ning seams and stains, All the sides of every hill Scarr'd with thaw and dripping chill, All the cold sky scowling black O'er the soaking country track; There a sobbing everywhere In the miserable air, And a thick fog brooding low O'er the black trail of the snow; While the Earth, amid the gloom Still half buried in her tomb, Swooning lay, and could not rise, With dark film upon her eyes. In the farmhouse (where a light Glimmer'd feebly day and night From the sick-room) Red Rose heard Earth's awakening, and stirr'd, Gazed around her, and descried Phœbe sitting at her side, Knitting, while the little child, Sleeping on the pillow, smiled. Little Phœbe's face was still, Calm with quiet strength and will. And the lamplight round her flitted Faintly, feebly, as she knitted. Full confession had she brought From Eureka's soul distraught. What he hid, in desperation, She supplied, by penetration. So she traced from the beginning All the story of the sinning. Had her spirit felt perchance Just a little more romance; Had the giant in her sight Seem'd a paragon more bright; Had the married love she bore Been a very little more— Why, perchance poor Phœbe's heart Might have taken the man's part, Heaping fiercely, as is common, All its hate upon the woman. Not so Phœbe! cold and pale Did she listen to the tale; Ne'er relenting, scarcely heeding, Heard the man's excusing, pleading; Felt her blood boil, and her face Crimson for a moment's space, Thinking darkly, in dismay, ‘What will Parson Pendon say?’ But at last the little soul Back to the sick chamber stole; Saw the wanderer lying there, Wildly, marvellously fair; Saw the little baby too Blinking with big eyes of blue; And she murmured, with a sigh, ‘She's deceived, as well as I. Hers is far the bitterest blow, 'Cause she seems to love him so.’ So thought Phœbe, calmly sitting By the bedside at her knitting, While the fog hung thick and low O'er the black trail of the Snow. Thus she did her duty there, Tending with a bitter care Her sick rival; spite her pain, Able, with a woman's brain, To discern as clear as day On whose side the sinning lay: Able to compassionate Her deluded rival's fate, All the weariness and care Of the fatal journey there; Able to acknowledge (this Far the most amazing is) On how dull and mean a thing Wasted was this passioning; On how commonplace a chance Hung the wanderer's romance; Round how mere a Log did twine The wild tendrils of this vine. Screen'd thus from the wintry blast, Droopt the Red Rose, fading fast; While the White Rose, hanging near, Trembled in a pensive fear. So the snow had nearly fled, And upon her dying bed Earth was quick'ning; damp and chill Streamed the fog on vale and hill. Like a slimy crocodile Weltering on banks o' Nile, Everywhere, with muddy maw, Crawl'd the miserable Thaw. On the pond and on the stream Loosen'd lights began to gleam, And before the snow could fleet Drizzly rains began to beat. Here and there upon the plain, 'Mid the pools of thaw and rain, Linger'd in the dismal light Patches of unmelted white. As these melted, very slowly, In a quiet melancholy, Vacant gleams o' the clouded blue Through the dismal daylight flew, And the wind, with a shrill clang, Went into the west, and sang. A sound of waters ever flowing; A stir, a tumult, ever growing; A gleam o' the blue, a west wind blowing; Warmth, and the last snow wreath was going. Not alone! ah! not alone! Waking up with fever'd moan, Red Rose started and looked round, Listening for a voice, a sound, And the skeleton, Pauguk, Crouching silent in his nook, Panted, like a famish'd thing, In the very act to spring. 'Twas at sunset; on the bed Crimson shafts of light were shed, And the face, famish'd and thin, Flash'd to sickly flame therein, While the eyes, with fevered glare, Sought a face they saw not there. Then she moan'd, and with a cry, Beckoning little Phœbe nigh, Whisper'd; but the words she said Perish'd uninterpreted. Still, in bitterest distress, Clinging to poor Phœbe's dress, With wild gestures, she in vain Tried to make her meaning plain. Then did little Phœbe see How the face changed suddenly! For invisible Pauguk, Creeping swiftly from his nook, Stood erect, and hung the head O'er the woman on the bed. Still the woman, glaring round, Listen'd for a voice, a sound, Crying wildly o'er and o'er, With her great eyes on the door. Pale, affrighted, and aghast, Phœbe understood at last— Knew the weary wanderer cried To behold him ere she died; So, without a word of blame, Phœbe called him, and he came. The sun was set, the night was growing, Softly the wind o' the west was blowing, The gates of heaven were overflowing; With the last snow Red Rose was going. VIII. The Last Look. To the bedside, white and quaking, Came Eureka, with a groan, Conscience-stricken now, and taking Her thin hand into his own. At the touch she kindled, rallied, With a look of gentle grace; Clung about him deathly pallid, And, uplooking in his face, Smiled! Ah, God! that smile of parting From her soul's dim depths upstarting! 'Twas a smile of awful beauty, Full of fatal love and duty; Such a smile as haunts for ever Any being but a beaver. Ev'n Eureka's stolid spirit Was half agonized to bear it. Smiling thus, and softly crooning Words he could not understand, Sank she on the pillow, swooning, Clutching still her hero's hand. Silent Spirits, shapes that love her, Is she resting? is all over? Nay; for while Eureka, quaking, Heart-sick, soul-sick to behold her, From the bed her worn form taking, Leans her head upon his shoulder; Once again, the spirit flying, With a last expiring ray, Waves a message, dimly dying, From its tenement of clay. Those great eyes upon him looking. Not reproaching, not rebuking, Brighten into bliss—perceiving Nought of shame or of deceiving: Only for the last time seeing Her great Chief, a god-like being; Only happy, all at rest, To be dying—on his breast. See! her hand points upward, slowly, With an awful grace and holy, And her eyes are saying clearly, ‘Master, lord, beloved so dearly, We shall meet, with souls grown fonder, In God's happy prairies yonder; Where no Snow falls; where, for ever, Flows the shining Milky River, On whose banks, divinely glowing, Shapes like ours are coming, going, In the happy star-dew moving, Silent, smiling, loved, and loving! Fare thee well, till then, my Master!’ Hark, her breath comes fainter, faster, While, in love man cannot measure, Kissing her white warrior's hand, Shesinks, with one great smile of pleasure— Last flash upon the blackening brand! EPILOGUE. In a dark corner of the burial-place, Where sleep apart the creatures of red race, Red Rose was laid, cold, beautiful, and dead, With all the great white Snow above her bed. And soon the tiny partner of her quest, The little babe, was laid upon her breast; For, though the heart of Phœbe had been kind, And sought to save the infant left behind, It wither'd when the mother's kiss withdrew— The Red Rose faded, and the Blossom too. There sleeps their dust, but 'neath another sky, More kind than this, their Spirits sleeping lie. Sleeping, or waking? There, with eyes tear-wet, Is her soul homeless? doth she wander yet, Silent by those still pathways, with bent head, Still listening, listening, for her warrior's tread? It came not, comes not—tho' the ages roll, Still with that life-long hunger in her soul, She must wait on, and thousand others too, If waking Immortality be true. But, no; God giveth his belovèd sleep; Rose of the wilderness, may thine be deep! Not near the white man's happy Death-domains, But in the red man's mighty hunting-plains; Amid the harmless shades of flocks and herds, Amid the hum of bees, the song of birds, With fields and woods all round, and skies above Dark as thine eyes, and deathless as thy love! Here ends my tale; what further should I state? Save that poor Phœbe soon forgave her mate, As small white wives forgive; with words outspoken The peace was patch'd almost as soon as broken; For Phœbe argued, after a good cry, ‘'Tis a bad job; but break my heart—not I! All the men do it—that's a fact confess'd, And my great stupid's only like the rest. But what's the good of fretting more than need? I've got the cows to mind, the hens to feed. I 'spose it's dreadful, but 'tis less a sin Than if the wench had a white woman's skin!’ Oft at his head her mocking shafts she aim'd, While by the hearth he hung the head ashamed, Pricking his moral hide right thro' and thro’, As virtuous little wives so well can do, Till out he swagger'd, cursing, sorely hit, And puzzled by the little woman's wit. Indeed, for seasons of domestic strife, She kept this rod in pickle all her life. As for Eureka, why, he felt, of course, Some conscience-prick, some tremor of remorse, Not deep enough to cause him many groans, Or keep the fat from growing on his bones. He throve, he prosper'd, was esteem'd by all,— At fifty, he was broad as he was tall; Loved much his pipe and glass, and at the inn Spake oft—an oracle of double chin. Did he forget her? Never! Often, while He sat and puff'd his pipe with easy smile, Surveying fields and orchards from the porch, And far away the little village church, While all seem'd peaceful—earth, and air, and sky,— A twinkle came into his fish-like eye; ‘Poor critter!’ sigh'd he, as a cloud he blew, ‘She was a splendid figure, and that's true!’ Faces on the Wall. (1876.) LONE HOUSE. Lone House amid the Main, where I abide, Faces there are around thy walls; and see With constant features, fair and faithfuleyed, In solemn silence these admonish me. They are the Faces of the strong and free; Prophets who on the car of Tempest ride; Martyrs who drift amid the waters wide On some frail raft, and pray on bended knee. Stay with me, Faces! make me free and strong! On other walls let flush'd Bacchantes leer; In quainter rooms of snugger sons of song Let old fantastic tapestries appear. Lone House! for comfort, when the nights are long, Let none but future-seeking eyes be here! STORM AND CALM. The lone House shakes, the wild waves leap around, Their sharp mouths foam, their frantic hands wave high; I hear around me a sad soul of sound,— A ceaseless sob,—a melancholy cry. Above, there is the trouble of the sky. On either side stretch waters with no bound. Within, my cheek upon my hand, sit I, Oft startled by sick faces of the drown'd. Yet are there golden dawns and glassy days When the vast Sea is smooth and sunk in rest, And in the sea the gentle heaven doth gaze, And, seeing its own beauty, smiles its best; With nights of peace, when, in a virgin haze, God's Moon wades thro' the shallows of the West. WITHOUT AND WITHIN. The Sea without, the silent room within, The Mystery above, the Void below! I watch the storms die and the storms begin; I see the white ships ghost-like come and go; I wave a signal they may see and know, As, crowding up on deck with faces thin, The seamen pass,—some sheltered creek to win, Or drift to whirling pools of pain and woe. What prospect, then, on midnights dark and dead, When the room rocks and the wild water calls?— Only to mark the beacon I have fed, Whose cold streak glassily on the black sea falls; Only, while the dim lamp burns overhead, To watch the glimmering Faces on the walls. NAPOLEON. Look on that picture, and on this. . . . Behold The Face that frown'd the rights of realms away; The imperial forehead, filleted with gold; The arrogant chin, the lips of frozen clay. This is the later Cæsar, whose great day Was one long sunset in blood-ruby rolled, Till, on an ocean-island lone and gray, It sank unblest, forgotten, dead, and cold. Yea, this is he who swept from plain to plain, Watering the harvest-fields with crimson rain; This is the Eagle who on garbage fed. Turn to the wall the pitiless eyes. Art, Thought, Law, Science, owed the monster less than nought; And Nature breath'd again when he was dead. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Turn; and, behold the sad Soul of the West Passing behind a Rainbow bloodily! Conscience incarnate, steadfast, strong, and free, Changeless thro' change, blessing and ever blessed. Sad storm-cloud with God's Iris on his breast, Across the troubled ocean travelled he,— Sad was his passing! gentle be his rest! God's Bow sails with him on another sea! At first no larger than a prophet's hand, Against the dense insufferable blue Cloud-like he came; and by a fierce wind fanned, Didst gather into greatness ere we knew, Then, flash by flash, most desolately grand, Passed away sadly heavenward, dropping dew! WALT WHITMAN. Friend Whitman! wert thou less serene and kind, Surely thou mightest (like our Bard sublime, Scorn'd by a generation deaf and blind), Make thine appeal to the avenger, Time; For thou art none of those who upward climb, Gathering roses with a vacant mind, Ne'er have thy hands for jaded triflers twined Sick flowers of rhetoric and weeds of rhyme. Nay, thine hath been a Prophet's stormier fate. While Lincoln and the martyr'd legions wait In the yet widening blue of yonder sky, On the great strand below them thou art seen,— Blessing, with something Christ-like in thy mien, A sea of turbulent lives that break and die! O FACES! O Faces! that look forward, eyes that spell The future time for signs, what see ye there? On what far gleams of portent do ye dwell? Whither, with lips like quivering leaves and hair Back-blowing in the whirlwind, do ye stare So steadfast and so still? Oh speak and tell! Is the soul safe? shall the sick world be well? Will morning glimmer soon, and all be fair? O Faces! ye are pale, and somewhat sad, And in your eyes there swim the fatal tears; But on your brows the dawn gleams cold and hoar. I, too, gaze forward, and my heart grows glad; I catch the comfort of the golden years; I see the Soul is safe for evermore! TO TRIFLERS. Go, triflers with God's secret. Far, oh far Be your thin monotone, your brows flower-crown'd, Your backward-looking faces; for ye mar The pregnant time with silly sooth of sound, With flowers around the feverish temples bound, And withering in the close air of the feast. Take all the summer pleasures ye have found, While Circe-charm'd ye turn to bird and beast. Meantime I sit apart, a lonely wight On this bare rock amid this fitful Sea, And in the wind and rain I try to light A little lamp that may a Beacon be, Whereby poor ship-folk, driving thro' the night, May gain the Ocean-course, and think of me! THE WANDERERS. God's blessing on poor ship-folk! Peace and prayer Fall on their eyelids till they close in sleep! God send them gentle winds and summer air, For the great sea is treacherous and deep. Light me up lamps on every ocean-steep,— Beacon the shallows with a loving care. Ay me! the wind cries and the wild waves leap, And on they drive—God knows—they know not—where. Come Poets! come, O Prophets! yea, disown The phantasies and phantoms ye pursue! Lights! lights! with fatal snares the sea is sown. Guide the poor ship-folk lone beneath the blue. Nay, do not light for Lazarus alone, But light for Dives and the Devil too. THE WATCHER OF THE BEACON. Lone is his life who, on a sea-tower blind, Watcheth all weathers o'er the beacon-light. Ah! woe to him if, mad with his own mind, He groweth sick for scenes more sweet and bright; For round him, in the dreadful winter night, The snow drifts, and the waves beat, and the wind Shrieks desolately, while with feeble sight He readeth some old Scripture left behind By those who sat before him in that place, And in their season perish'd, one and all. . . . Wild raves the wind: the Faces on the wall Seem phantoms: features dark and dim to trace. He starteth up—he tottereth—he would fall, When, lo! the gleam of one Diviner Face! ‘AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED UPON THE WATERS.’ O Faces! fade upon the wall, and leave This only, for the watcher to implore. Dim with the peace that starry twilights weave, It riseth, and the storm is hush'd and o'er. Trembling I feed my feeble lamp once more, Tho' all be placid as a summer eve. See there it moves where weary waters grieve,— O mariners! look yonder and adore! Spirit, grow brighter on my nights and days; Shine out of heaven; my guide and comfort be: Pilot the wanderers through the ocean ways; Keep the stars steadfast, and the waters free: Lighten thy lonely creature while he prays: Keep his Soul strong amid the mighty Sea! Balder the Beautiful. A SONG OF DIVINE DEATH. ? ?????? ?????! ‘For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. . . . But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die. . . . Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.’—Paul, Cor. ist Ep. chap. xv. NOTE. It may be well for readers of the following poem to dismiss from their minds all recollection ot the Eddas, Ewald's Balder, Oehlenschläger's Balder hün Gode, and even Mr. Arnold's Balder Dead. With the hero of these familiar works my Balder has little in common; he is neither the shadowy god of the Edda, nor the colossal hero of Ewald, nor the good principle of Oehlenschläger: nor the Homeric demigod of Mr. Arnold. In the presentation of both the Father and Son, I have reverted to the lines of the most primitive mythology: discovering in the one the northern Messiah as well as the northern Apollo, in the other (instead of the degraded Odin of later superstition) the Alfadur, or temporarily omnipotent godhead, who, despite his darker features, has affinity with both the Zeus of the Eleusinian mysteries and the Jehovah of the Bible. It is unnecessary, however, further to explain the spirit of a poem which each competent reader will interpret in his own way, and which, if it fulfils its purpose at all, should have many meanings for many minds. A portion of Balder the Beautiful has already been printed in the pages of the Contemporary Review. PROEM TO?. A SONG OF A DREAM. O what is this cry in our burning ears, And what is this light on our eyes, dear love? The cry is the cry of the rolling years, As they break on the sun-rock, far above; And the light is the light of that rock of gold As it burneth bright in a starry sea; And the cry is clearer a hundredfold, And the light more bright, when I gaze on thee. My weak eyes dazzle beneath that gleam, My sad ears deafen to hear that cry: I was born in a dream, and I dwell in a dream, And I go in a dream to die! O whose is this hand on my forehead bare, And whose are these eyes that look in mine? The hand is the Earth's soft hand of air, The eyes are the Earth's—thro' tears they shine; And the touch of the hand is so soft, so light, As the ray of the blind orbs blesseth me; But the touch is softest, the eyes most bright, When I sit and smile by the side of thee. For the mortal Mother's blind eyes beam With the long-lost love of a life gone by, On her breast I woke in a beauteous dream, And I go in a dream to die! O what are the voices around my way, And what are these shadows that stir below? The voices of waifs in a world astray, The shadows of souls that come and go. And I hear and see, and I wonder more, For their features are fair and strange as mine, But most I wonder when most I pore On the passionate peace of this face of thine. We walk in silence by wood and stream, Our gaze upturned to the same blue sky: We move in a dream, and we love in a dream, And we go in our dream to die! O what is this music of merry bells, And what is this laughter across the wold? 'Tis the mirth of a market that buys and sells, 'Tis the laughter of men that are counting gold. I walk thro' Cities of silent stone, And the public places alive I see; The wicked flourish, the weary groan, And I think it real, till I turn to thee! And I smile to answer thine eyes' bright beam, For I know all's vision that darkens by: That they buy in a dream, and they sell in a dream, And they go in a dream to die. O what are these shapes on their thrones of gold, And what are those clouds around their feet? The shapes are kings with their hearts clay-cold, The clouds are armies that ever meet; I see the flame of the crimson fire, I hear the murdered who moan ‘Ah me!’— My bosom aches with its bitter ire, And I think it real, till I turn to thee! And I hear thee whisper, ‘These shapes but seem— They are but visions that flash and fly, While we move in a dream, and love in a dream, And go in our dream to die!’ O what are these Spirits that o'er us creep, And touch our eyelids and drink our breath? The first, with a flower in his hand, is Sleep; The next, with a star on his brow, is Death. We fade before them whene'er they come, (And never single those spirits be!) A little season my lips are dumb, But I waken ever,—and look for thee. Yea, ever each night when the pale stars gleam And the mystical Brethren pass me by, This cloud of a trance comes across my dream, As I seem in my dream to die! O what is this grass beneath our feet, And what are these beautiful under-blooms? The grass is the grass of the churchyard, Sweet, The flowers are flowers on the quiet tombs. I pluck them softly, and bless the dead, Silently o'er them I bend the knee, But my tenderest blessing is surely said, Tho' my tears fall fast, when I turn to thee. For our lips are tuned to the same sad theme, We think of the loveless dead, and sigh; Dark is the shadow across our dream, For we go in that dream to die! O what is this moaning so faint and low, And what is this crying from night to morn? The moaning is that of the souls that go, The crying is that of the souls new-born. The life-sea gathers with stormy calls, The wind blows shrilly, the foam flies free. The great wave rises, the great wave falls, I swim to its height by the side of thee! With arms outstretching and throats that scream, With faces that flash into foam and fly, Our beings break in the light of a dream, As the great waves gather and die. O what is this Spirit with silvern feet, His bright head wrapt in a saffron veil? Around his raiment our wild arms beat, We cling unto them, but faint and fail. 'Tis the Spirit that sits on the twilight star, And soft to the sound of the waves sings he, He leads the chaunt from his crystal car, And I join in the mystical chaunt with thee, And our beings burn with the heavenly theme, For he sings of wonders beyond the sky, Of a god-like dream, and of gods in a dream, Of a dream that cannot die! O closer creep to this breast of mine; We rise, we mingle, we break, dear love! A space on the crest of the wave we shine, With light and music and mirth we move; Before and behind us (fear not, sweet!) Blackens the trough of the surging sea— A little moment our mouths may meet, A little moment I cling to thee; Onward the wonderful waters stream, 'Tis vain to struggle, 'tis vain to cry— We wake in a dream, and we ache in a dream, And we break in a dream, and die! But who is this other with hair of flame, The naked feet, and the robe of white? A Spirit, too, with a sweeter name, A softer smile, a serener light. He wraps us both in a golden cloud, He thrills our frames with a fire divine, Our souls are mingled, our hearts beat loud, My breath and being are blent with thine: And the sun-rock flames with a flash supreme, And the starry waves have a stranger cry— We climb to the crest of our golden dream, For we dream that we cannot die! Aye! the cry rings loud in our burning ears, And the light flames bright on our eyes, dear love, And we know the cry of the rolling years As they break on the sun-rock far above; And we know the light of the rock of gold, As it burneth bright in a starry sea, And the glory deepens a thousandfold As I name the immortal gods and thee! We shrink together beneath that gleam, We cling together before that cry; We were made in a dream, and we fade in a dream, And if death be a dream, we die! Balder the Beautiful. The gods are brethren. Wheresoe'er They set their shrines of love or fear, In Grecian woods, by banks of Nile, Where cold snows sleep or roses smile, The gods are brethren. Zeus the Sire Was fashion'd of the self-same fire As Odin; He whom Ind brought forth Hath his pale kinsmen east and north; And more than one since life began Hath known Christ's agony for Man. The gods are brethren. Kin by fate, In gentleness as well as hate, 'Mid heights that only Thought may climb They come, they go; they are, or seem; Each, rainbow'd from the rack of Time, Casts broken lights across God's Dream. I. THE BIRTH OF BALDER. I. Balder's Birth-Song. There blent with his growing The leaf and the flower, The wind lightly blowing Its balm from afar, The smile of the sunshine, The sob of the shower, The beam of the moonshine, The gleam of the star. 'Mid shining of faces And waving of wings, With gifts from all places Came beautiful things; The blush from the blossom, The bloom from the corn, Blent into his bosom, Ere Balder was born. As a rainbow in heaven Was woven the rune, The colours were seven Most dim and divine: Thro' regions of thunder Serene swam the moon, With white rays of wonder Completing the sign. The snow-star was gleaming Cold, silent, and clear, Its bright image beaming Deep down in the mere; The night grew profounder, The earth slept forlorn, With the drift wrapt around her Ere Balder was born. Beside a waste water Lay Frea alone, In Asgard they sought her, To earth she had crept; The Father was sitting Snow-white on his throne, The night-clouds were flitting, The wind-harps were swept. No eyes divine found her— She lay as one dead— Vast forests around her, Black vapours o'erhead,— She saw not,—she heard not,— But weary and worn, Snow-shrouded, she stirred not, Ere Balder was born. There, hid from the Father, She brooded below, In realms where pines gather Ice-robed and ice-crown'd, And the great trees were drooping, Struck down by the snow, With chilly arms stooping To touch the white ground. While whirlwinds were weaving Their raiment of cloud, She sat there conceiving, Dark, brooding, and bow'd; But where the boughs thicken'd A bird sang one morn,— And she kindled and quicken'd, Ere Balder was born. Then by that great water, Within the dark woods, The dawn broke, and brought her A glimmer of Spring! The gray geese came crying Far over the floods, The black crane pass'd, flying With slow waft of wing. And when the moon's silver Was shed on the mere, The cry of the culver Was heard far and near, And the owls to each other Made answers forlorn,— And she smiled, the sad Mother, Ere Balder was born. Then the peace and the splendour Of powers of the night, And the strength that grows tender Where dusk rivers run, The beam of the moonshine, The soft starry light, And the first smile of sunshine, Were woven in one. And they mingled within her With motions of earth To strengthen and win her To mystical birth;— By the pangs of a woman The goddess was torn, Ere, with heart of the human, God Balder was born. The wind-gods were blowing Their trumpets of might, The skies were still snowing, And dark was the wold,— With a rock for her pillow Lay Frea that night, Beneath a great willow All leafless and cold— But the earth to strange motion Was stirring around, And the ice of the ocean Had split with shrill sound;— When coldly upspringing Arose the red morn, To a sound as of singing Bright Balder was born! His hair was as golden As lily-hearts be, When, softly unfolden, From black tarns they rise,— The lights of the azure, The shades of the sea, Blent into the pleasure Of beautiful eyes; Like the aspen that lingers Where waters run fleet Was the touch of his fingers, The thrill of his feet; White, white as the blossom That blows on the thorn, On Frea's fair bosom Bright Balder was born. While soften'd and sadden'd With love shone her face, Uplooking he gladden'd And clung to her breast, For a light as of summer Swept over the place, When the shining new-comer Awoke from his rest! And the willow and alder Thrill'd out unto bloom, And the lilac brought Balder Its light and perfume, While the merle sable-suited Sang merry by morn, And with bill of gold fluted That Balder was born! At the notes of the singer The sun glimmer'd gay, And touch'd with bright finger The child as he stirred! For the snow from the mountains Was melting away, And the sound of the fountains Upleaping was heard; And the black soil was broken To radiance of flowers, While the Bow for a token Gleam'd down thro' the showers; Deep under the fallow Now sprouted the corn, And swift flash'd the swallow, For Balder was born! Yea, again up in heaven Was rainbow'd the rune, And the colours were seven Most dim and divine: Sweet creatures work'd under The sun and the moon, Completing the wonder With whisper and sign. With eyes brightly gleaming The squirrel came near, In flocks swam the lemming Across the great mere, And the gold-speckled spider Found Frea that morn, And was busy beside her When Balder was born. And with him came waking The leaf and the flower, The wind lightly shaking Its balm from afar, The smile of the sunshine, The sob of the shower, The beam of the moonshine, The gleam of the star. 'Mid shining of faces And waving of wings, With gifts from all places Came beautiful things; By night-time and day-time No life was forlorn, 'Twas leaf-time, 'twas May-time, And Balder was born. Yet the spell had been woven Long ages ago, That the clouds should be cloven, The Father undone, When the light of the sunshine, The white of the snow, And the starshine and moonshine, Were mingled in one; When the wind and the water, The star and the flower, Found a goddess, and brought her Their strength for a dower; Yea, in runes it was written, With letters forlorn, That the gods should be smitten When Balder was born. Then roar'd the mad thunder From regions afar, And the world darken'd under That wrath of the skies. But the new-born, upleaping As bright as a star, Awoke from his sleeping With love in his ears;— And the dark rain ceased falling, With slow silvern thrills, And the cuckoo came, calling Aloud on the hills, And the glad Earth uplifted Her face to the morn, And past the storm drifted, For Balder was born. . . . In the sedge of the river The swan makes its nest; In the mere, with no quiver, Stands shadow'd the crane; Earth happy and still is, Peace dwells in her breast, And the lips of her lilies Drink balm from the rain; The lamb in the meadow Upsprings with no care, Deep in the wood's shadow Is born the young bear; The ash and the alder, The flowers and the corn, All waited for Balder,— And Balder is born! II. His Growth and Godhead. Lovely as light and blossoms are, And gentle as the dew, A white god stainless as a star, Deep-hidden, Balder grew. For in the time when violets grow, And birds sing thro' the showers, Pale Frea left the child below, Upon a bank of flowers. And heavenward now on weary feet The mighty goddess flies, And kneeleth at the Father's seat, And gazeth in his eyes. Around her in those shadowy halls The great gods darkly tread. ‘Where is thy child?’ each cold voice calls; Calmly she answereth, ‘Dead. ‘The arrows of the gods are keen, An infant's heart is mild; Buried within the forest green, Now slumbereth my child. ‘The robin strewed him o'er with leaves, And closed his eyes of blue, And overhead the spider weaves Her rune of silk and dew.’ Pale at the mighty banquet board The Mother sat in pain: The great gods smiling, with no word, Drank deep, and breathed again. . . . But down within the forest dim The child divine lies quick! The slanted sunlight comes to him Thro' branches woven thick. He drinks no nurture of the breast, No mother's kiss he knows; Warm as a song bird in its nest He feels the light, and grows. Around him flock all gentle things Which range the forest free: Each shape that blooms, each shape that sings, Looks on him silently. The light is melted on his lips And on his eyes of blue, And from the shining leaves he sips The sweetness of the dew. And slowly like an earthborn child He learns to walk and run— A forest form, with laughter wild, He wanders in the sun. And now he knows the great brown bear, And sitteth with its young, And of their honcy takes his share, Sucking with thirsty tongue. Around him as he comes and goes There clings a golden mist, And in his bright hair blooms a rose, And a bird sings on his wrist! And wheresoe'er he sets his feet Fair ferns and flowers spring, And honeysuckles scented sweet Grow where his fingers cling. He calls, and wood-doves at the cry Come down to be caress'd; Curl'd in his arms the lynx will lie, Its lips against his breast. O look into his happy eyes, As lustrous as the dew! A light like running water lies Within their depths of blue; And there the white cloud's shadow dim Stirs, mirror'd soft and gray, And far within the dream-dews swim With melancholy ray. Ev'n thus in beauteous shape he grows, Unknown, unseen, unheard, And night by night he takes repose Like any flower or bird. He drinks the balmy breath of Earth, He feels the light and rain, Till, like a thing of mortal birth, He shares her peace or pain. A wild white shape with wondering eyes He walks by wood and stream, And softly on his spirit lies The burthen of a dream. His hair is like the midnight sun's, All golden-red and bright; But radiance as of moonrise runs Upon his limbs of white. And now the wood without a sound Hushes its leaves in dread: Beauty and mystery surround The silence of his tread. Quietly as a moonbeam creeps He moves from place to place; Soft steals the starlight, as he sleeps, To breathe upon his face. The ground grows green beneath his feet, While, trembling on the stem, The pale flowers drink again, full sweet, The breath he draws from them. Now brightly gleams the soft green sod, The golden sceds are sown; O pale white lily of a god, Thou standest now full blown! II. THE FINDING OF BALDER. I. Frea in the Wood. Blue night. Along the lonely forest way The goddess, mighty-limb'd and marble white, Tall in the shadow of the pines that waved Their black arms in the moonrise overhead, Stole silent-footed. Round her naked feet The dews were luminous, and the breath of flowers Rose from the scented path of grass and fern, And all was stiller than a maiden's dream. From grove to grove she went, like one that knew Each shadow of that silent forest old, And ever as she went the tangled light That trembled on her thro' the woven boughs Grew deeper and more dewy, until at last She knew by chilly gleams upon the grass That dawn was come. Still did that umbrage deep Remain in dimness, tho' afar away The hills were kindling with dull blood-red fires; But when the trumpet of the day was blown From the great golden gateways of the sun, When leaf by leaf the crimson rose o' the east Open'd, and leaf by leaf illumed in turn Glitter'd the snowy lily of the north, She left the shelter of those woods, and stood Under the shining canopy of heaven. Betore her lay a vast and tranquil lake, And wading in its shallows silently Great storks of golden white and light green cranes Stood sentinel, while far as eye could see, Swam the wild water-lily's oilëd leaves. Still was that place as sleep, yet evermore A stir amid its stillness; for behold, At every breath of the warm summer wind Blown on the beating bosom of the lake, The white swarms of the new-born lily-flowers, A pinch of gold-dust in the heart of each, Rose from the bubbling depths, and open'd up, And floated luminous with cups of snow. Across that water came so sweet an air, It fell upon the immortal mother's brow Like coolest morning dew, and tho' she stood Beneath the open arch of heaven, the light Stole thro' the gauze of a soft summer mist Most gentle and subdued. Then while she paused Close to the rippling shallows sown with reeds, Those cranes and storks arose above her head In one vast cloud of flying green and gold; And from the under-heaven innumerable The lilies upward to the surface snow'd, Till all the waters glitter'd gold and white; And lo! the sun swept shining up the east, And thro' the cloud of birds, and on the lake, Shot sudden rays of light miraculous,— Until the goddess veil'd her dazzled eyes, And with the heaving whiteness at her feet Her bosom heaved, till of that tremulous life She seem'd a throbbing part! Tall by the marge The goddess tower'd, and her immortal face Was shining as anointed; then she cried, ‘Balder!’ and like the faint cry of a bird That passeth overhead, the sound was borne Between the burning ether and the earth. Then once again she called, outstretching arms, ‘Balder!’ Upon her face the summer light Trembled in benediction, while the voice Was lifted up and echoed till it died Far off amid the forest silences. A space she paused, smiling and listening, Gazing upon the lilies as they rose Large, luminously fair, and new-baptized; And once again she would have call'd aloud, When far across the waters suddenly There shone a light as of the morning star; Which coming nearer seem'd as some bright bird Floating amid the lilies and their leaves, And presently, approaching closer still, Assumed the likeness of a shining shape, Who, with white shoulders from the waters reaching, And sunlight burning on his golden hair, Swam like a swan. Upon his naked arms The amber light was melted, while they clove The crystal depths and softly swept aside The glittering lilies and their clustering leaves; And on the forehead of him burnt serene A light as of a pearl more wonderful Than ever from the crimson seas of Ind Was snatch'd by human hand; for pearl it seem'd, Tho' blood-red, and as lustrous as a star. Him Frea breathless watch'd, for all the air Was golden with his glory as he came; And o'er his head the bird-cloud hover'd bright With murmurs deep; and thro' the lake he swam With arm-sweeps swift, till in the shallows bright, Still dripping from the kisses of the waves, He rose erect in loveliness divine. The lustre from his ivory arms and limbs Stream'd as he stood, and from his yellow hair A glory rain'd upon his neck and breast, While burning unextinguish'd on his brow Shone that strange star. Then as he shining rose, And on her form the new effulgence fell, The goddess, with her face beatified, Yet gentle as a mortal mother's, cried ‘Balder! my Balder!’—and while from all the woods, And from the waters wide, and from the air Still rainbow'd with the flashing flight of birds, Innumerable echoes answer'd, ‘Balder!’— Clad in his gentle godhead Balder stood, Bright, beautiful, and palpably divine. II. The Shadow in the Wood. ‘Mother!’ he said, and on that mother's face Fixing the brightness of his starry eyes, He kiss'd her, smiling. E'en as sunlight falls Upon the whiteness of some western cloud, Irradiating and illuming it, His beauty smote her sadness: silently She trembled; and her large immortal orbs Were raised to heaven. For a space she stood O'er-master'd by that splendour, but at last, While softly from her forehead and her cheeks The loving rapture ebb'd, and once again Her face grew alabaster calm and cold, Her soul found speech. ‘O Balder! best beloved! God of the sunlight and the summer stars, White Shepherd of the gentle beasts and birds, Benign-eyed watcher of all beauteous things, Thou know'st me! thou rememberest! thou art here, Supreme, a god, my Son!—Within thine eyes Immortal innocence and mortal peace Are blent to love and gentleness divine; And tho' I left thee in these woods a babe, Fair and unconscious as a fallen flower, And tho' I have not watch'd thy beauty grow, I come again to seek thee, and behold Thou know'st me—thou rememberest! thou art here, Supreme, a god, my Son! Blest be those powers To whose lone keeping I committed thee! The heavens have shone upon thee, and the boughs Have curtain'd thee for slumber, and the rain Hath smooth'd thy soft limbs with its silvern fingers, And gently ministrant to thee have been The starlight and the moonlight and the dew, And in their seasons all the forest flowers; And from the crimson of divine deep dawns And from the flush of setting suns, thy cheeks Have gather'd such a splendour as appals The vision, even mine. Balder! beloved! Speak to me! tell me how thy soul hath fared Alone so long in these green solitudes.’ She ceased, and Balder smiled again, and took Her hand and held it as he answer'd her; And ne'er was sound of falling summer showers On boughs with lilac laden and with rose, Or cuckoo-cries o'er emerald uplands heard, Or musical murmurs of dark summer dawns, More sweet than Balder's voice. ‘O Mother, Mother,’ It answer'd, ‘when I saw thee from afar, Silent, stone-still, with shadow at thy feet, I knew thee well, for nightly evermore I have seen thy shape in sleep.’ And while the face Of the great goddess kindled once again With its maternal love ineffable, He added, ‘Thou shalt read me all my dream! For in a dream here have I grown and thriven, With such dim rapture as those lilies feel Awakening and uprising mystically From darkness to the brightness of the air; And growing in a dream I have beheld All things grow gladder with me, sun and star, Strange fronds, and all the wonders of the wood; Till round me, with me, soul and part of me, This world hath kindled like an opening rose. And happy had I been as any bird Singing full-throated in the summer light, But for some dark and broken images Which come to me in sleep—yea come each night When from the starlight and the silvern moon I fade with closëd eyes. But thou art here, And in the love of thy celestial looks I read the answer to the mystery Of my dim earthly being.’ As he spake, Across the goddess' face and thro' her frame There pass'd the wind of an old prophecy, Bending her downward as a storm-swept bough. ‘In sleep! what shapes have come to thee in sleep?’ She cried, and Balder answer'd, ‘It were long To tell thee all, my Mother! but meseems I have dream'd nightly of mysterious forms White-brow'd like thee and very beautiful— Strange spirits, each more bright than is a star, In robes of linen and of whitest wool, And some all raimentless as leaf or flower, And in their nakedness the more divine.’ Then Frea smiled and answer'd, ‘That is well— These, Balder, are thy sisters and my kin, Less beautiful than thou, yet very fair.’ And Balder said, ‘Ofttimes mine eyes have seen Great shapes caparison'd in burning gold, Tall as the tallest pine within these woods, Who flash'd red brands together, or upheld Bright cups of ruby, gazing on each other!’ And Frea smiled and said, ‘That too is well— Those, Balder, are thy brethren and thy peers, Great gods, yet less than thou.’ Then Balder's voice Sank lower, saying, ‘Three times in my sleep I have seen my Father!’ Frea's cheek was blanch'd, And pressing one white hand upon her heart, ‘How seem'd he in thy sleep?’ the goddess sigh'd, ‘Frown'd he or smiled he? speak!’ And Balder said, In solemn whispers, sinking ever lower, ‘My soul perceived a darkness and a sound Of many voices wailing, and I seem'd As one that drifts upon a sunless water, Amid the washing of a weary rain— Wet were my locks and dripping, and my limbs Hung heavily as lead—while wave by wave I floated to some vapour-shrouded shore. At last, wash'd in upon the slippery weeds, I saw before me on a mountain top One brooding like a cloud; and as a cloud At first he seem'd, yet ever as I look'd Grew shapen to an image terrible, With eyes eternal gazing down at mine. And as I rose a voice came from the cloud Like far-off muffled thunder, crying “Balder! Come hither, my son Balder!”—when in fear I scream'd and woke, and saw the daylight dance Golden upon the forests and the meres.’ He ceased; and utter pity fill'd his soul To see across his beauteous Mother's face The scorching of unutterable pain; Then thrice the troubled goddess raised her eyes And gazed up northward where the rose-red shafts Of dawn were trembling on the cloud-capt towers Of Asgard; thrice the sorrow master'd her; But soon her strong soul conquer'd, and she forced A strange sad look of calm. ‘If that be all, Take courage—and I do conjure thee now, Fear not thy Father. If that Father ever Hath cherish'd dread of thee, the loveliness Of thy completed godhead shall disarm His wrath,—yea, win his love.’ Her gentle hand Clasp'd his with more than mortal tenderness, And in his eyes she gazed again and drank The solace of his beauty while the dawn Encrimson'd both and all the heavens and air, But Balder trembled shrinking to her side, And cried, with quick eyes glancing all around, ‘Mother, that is not all!’ ‘O speak no more,’ The goddess said, ‘if aught else terrible Thine eyes have vision'd or thy sense hath dream'd, Speak, speak, no more!’ but Balder answer'd, ‘Mother! A weight is on my heart, and I must speak. Last night I dream'd the strangest dream of dreams! Methought I in the summer woodland walk'd And pluck'd white daffodils and pansies blue, And as I went I sang such songs as sing The spirits of the forest and the stream; And presently the golden light went in, But balmy darkness follow'd, for the rain Patter'd with diamond dews innumerable On the green roof of umbrage overhead. I stood and waited, listening. Then methought I heard a voice from far away—thy voice It seem'd, my Mother—murmur three times “Balder!” And as it ceased, there pierced the wood's green heart A shriek so sharp and shrill that all my blood Turn'd cold to listen! Suddenly I felt My brow was damp with chilly drops of rain, And looking up I saw that every leaf Had wither'd from the branches overhead, Leaving them black against a sunless heaven Of dark and dreary gray. Again I heard Thy voice moan “Balder,” and methought the boughs Toss'd their wild arms above and echoed “Balder,” When lo, the black and miserable rain Came slower and slower, wavering through the dark, Till every drop was as a flake of white Falling upon the ground as light as wool! And terror seized me, and I felt my heart Cold as a stone, and from my hands the flowers Dropt, wither'd, with that whiteness on the ground. I tried to stir, and could not stir; I sought To shake the chilly flakes from off my neck, But could not; and each time I sought to cry. My cries were frozen in my throat. Now mark! O mark, my mother, for these things are strange! As thus I stood, mine eyes were 'ware of One, A Shape with shadowy arms outspread like wings, Which, hovering o'er me even as a hawk, Fix'd on my face its fatal luminous eyes. O Mother, that wan shape! The forest holds, In form of beast or bird or glittering snake, No likeness of its awful lineaments! For ever as its features seem'd to take Clearness and semblance, they did fade away Into a swooning dimness; and it seem'd Now shapen and now shapeless, blowing amid The wonder of that wan and sunless shower. Yet ever as I gazed it gazed again, And ever circling nearer seem'd in act To swoop upon me with cold claws and clutch The heart that flutter'd wildly in my breast. At last that look became too much to bear: Answering at last thy scream, I scream'd aloud; And as I scream'd, I woke—and saw again The sunlight on the forests and the meres.’ Now ev'n as Balder spake the goddess' face Was like a shrouded woman's: once again She gazed at heaven, and her eyes were glazed With agony and despair, for now she knew That shape which Balder had beheld in dream Was he whom mortal man have christen'd Death. At last she spake, and all her proud soul flash'd, Rebuking its own terror. ‘Unto all, Yea even unto gods upon their thrones, Such shadows come in sleep; thy Father even Hath had his visions, and I too have mine; But be of comfort since thou art my Son, For he who hover'd o'er thee in thy dream Is impotent against the strength of gods. Haunter is he of this sad nether sphere, And on the little life of bird and beast, And on the life of flowers and falling leaves, His breath comes chill, but to the Shapes divine He is as wind that bloweth afar below The silence of the peaks.’ Ev'n as she spake, On her bright Balder gazed not, but with eyes Fix'd as in fascination, cried aloud ‘Look! look!’—and pointed. Close to that bright spot Whereon they stood in the full flame of day, The forest open'd, flashing green and gold, Sparkling with quick and rapturous thrill of leaves And rainbow-flush of flowers. Upon a bough That reach'd its heavy-laden emerald arm Into the summer light beyond the shade, There clung, with panting breast and fluttering wings, A trembling ringdove whose soft iris'd eyes Were fix'd like Balder's on some shape of dread Just visible in the shadow, lying low Under the scented umbrage of the wood. A Form, yet indistinct as the green sheen; A Face, yet featureless; a head with eyes Now faint as drops of dew, now strangely bright As lustrous gems. Crouch'd on the under-grass, It watch'd in serpent fashion every thrill Of that bright bird; while all around, the air Was mad and merry with the summer song Of choirs that sat alive on leafy boughs, Singing aloud! Then came a hush, wherein Every faint pulse of life in those great woods Was heard to beat; and then the fated bird Cooing and quivering fluttered from the bough, And 'mid the summer sheen beyond the shade, With one last dying tremor of the wings, Lay stricken still. . . . Among the darkening leaves There was a stir, as creeping thro' the gloom, Scarce visible, fixing eyes on that dead dove, Forth from his lair the form began to crawl. And Balder sicken'd, and his sense grew cold. But with a queenly gesture Frea rose, And pointed with her white imperious hand Into the forest. Suddenly the shape Was 'ware of that pale goddess and her son More beauteous and insufferably bright. A moment in the dimness of his lair He paused, uprearing, as in act to spring, A head half human, with a serpent's eyes; Then, conscious of some presence that he feared, All swift and silent, like a startled snake, He faded back into the shadowy woods. III. Full Godhead. O whither are they wending side by side Thro' that green forest wide? Down the deep dingles, amid ferns and flowers, They wander hours and hours. Bright-lock'd, with limbs of alabaster white, Now gleaming in the light, Now 'mong the dusky umbrage of the glade Deep'ning to amber shade, Their eyes on one another, whither away Do these Immortals stray? She murmurs, ‘Thou shalt mark all things that be; The rivers and the sea, The mountains that for ever crimson'd lie Against the arctic sky, The meteors that across the pale pole flit, Strangely illuming it; And thou shalt look on gods, thy kin and mine, Since thou too art divine.’ Divine!—The forest glimmers where he goes To crimson and to rose! And wheresoe'er he comes no creature fears; Each lingers, sees, and hears. The boughs bend down to touch his yellow hair; Around his white feet bare The grass waves amorous; on his shoulder white The singing birds alight, Singing the sweeter; and in spaces clear The brown-eyed dappled deer With tremulous ear and tail around him stand, Licking his outstretch'd hand With warm rough tongues. He sings—all things around Are husht to hear the sound! He smiles—all things are smiling—wood and stream With some new glory gleam, Dark branches blossom, and the greensward nigh Is sunnier than the sky! She murmurs, ‘They have cherish'd thee indeed, In answer to thy need. Ere thou wast born, into thy veins they grew, Earth, sunlight, air, and dew, The flower, the leaf, star's glimmer and bird's song; And these have made thee strong With other strength than ours; for ne'er till now, On any immortal brow Have I beheld such living splendour shine As lies this hour on thine. O sunbeam of the gods! O fairer far Than ev'n Immortals are! Divinest, gentlest, by the glad Earth given To be a lamp in heaven!’ Divine!—The boughs shook down their shafts of green And gleam'd to golden sheen; The silvern snake stole from the dark treeroot And twined round Balder's foot With happy eyes; the tiger-moth and bee About him hover'd free; With yellow aureole his head was crown'd, And his bright body around There swam a robe of sunshine scented sweet, Clothing him head to feet. She crieth, ‘Could the Father see thee there, While on thy silken hair The soft. light trembles like a shining hand! Couldst thou before him stand, Flowers round thy feet, a dove upon thy wrist, Earth-blest and heaven-kist, Would he not smile? would he not scorn full soon The wearily woven rune Which said that sorrow should be born when thou Didst break with orient brow The night-cloud of the Earth? O Son! my Son! The crimson thread is spun, The snow-white bud is blown, and now, behold! The branch with fruit of gold Hath grown full straight and swings i' the summer shine Ineffably divine.’ He questions, ‘Whither go we?’ She replies, ‘To that dim Land which lies Ev'n as a cloud around the Father's feet!’ He smiles, his pulses beat With brighter rapture. ‘Shall mine eyes then see My Father?’ crieth he; ‘Where dwells he? and my brethren, where dwell they?’ She answereth, ‘Far away!’ Then, her face darken'd by some dreamy dread, She moves with sadder tread. The shadows grow around them as they stray From glade to glade; their way Winds still 'mong flowers and leaves, where day and night, Both sleepless and both bright, One golden and one silvern, come and go. Nor, when dark twilights sow Their asphodels in the broad fields of blue, And a cold summer dew Gleams on the grass, and moths with fiery eyes Flit, and the night-jar cries, Doth Balder glimmer less divine. Ah, nay! Dim things that know not day Find him and love him; drinking his pure breath The white owl hovereth; About his footprints in the faint moon-ray Wild lynxes leap and play; The ringdoves on the branches brood; meek hares Creep from their grassy lairs To look upon him. So he goeth by Of all things that descry Beloved, and missed; around him like a veil The moonbeams cluster pale, And all the eyes of heaven with soft dews swim, As they gaze down on him. But now they leave the mighty woods, and pass Thro' valleys of deep grass, Sprinkled with saxifrage and tormentil; And many a mountain rill Leaps by them, singing. Far away, on high, They mark against the sky Blue-shadow'd mountains crown'd with sparkling snow; And thitherward they go. Thro' lonely mountain valleys in whose breast The white grouse makes its nest, And where in circles wheel the goshawk keen And fleet-wing'd peregrine; Past torrents gashing the dark heathery height With gleams of hoary white, Their shining feet now fall, and where they fare Faint rainbows fill the air And span the streams; with sound of rippling rain The cataracts leap amain, The deer cry from the heights, and all around Is full of summer sound. Silent, upon the topmost peak they come, By precipices dumb And melancholy rocks girt round; and so They reach the realms of snow. Far o'er their heads a hooded eagle wings In ever-widening rings, Till in the blinding glory of the day A speck he fades away. Then Balder's eyes gaze down. Stretch'd far beneath, Forest and field and heath, Netted with silvern threads of springs and streams, Shine in the summer beams— And valley after valley farther on Fades dim into the sun. He crieth, ‘Far away methinks I mark A mighty Forest dark, Crown'd by a crimson mist; yonder it lies, Stretching into the skies, And farther than its darkness nought I see.’ And softly answereth she, ‘O Balder! 'tis the Ocean. Vast and strange, It changeth without change, Washing with weary waves for evermore The dark Earth's silent shore.’ And Balder spake not, but he gazed again Thro' the soft mist of rain Which curtain'd that new wonder from his sight. At last, when day and night Have passed, they cross a purple cape and stand On shores of golden sand, And pausing silent, see beneath the sky The mighty Ocean lie. IV. The Man by the Ocean. Calmly it lieth, limitless and deep, In windless summer sleep, And from its fringe, cream-white and set with shells, A drowsy murmur swells, While in its shallows, on its yellow sands, Smiling, uplifting hands, Moves Balder, beckoning with bright looks and words The snow-white ocean-birds. He smiles—the heavens smile answer! All the sea Is glistering glassily. Far out, blue-black amid the waters dim, Leviathan doth swim, Spouts fountain-wise, roars loud, then sinking slow, Seeks the green depths below. All silent. All things sleeping in the light, And all most calmly bright! He walks the weed-strewn strand, and where the waves Creep into granite caves, Green-paven, silver-fretted, roof'd with rose, He like a sunbeam goes, And ocean-creatures know him. The black seal Out of the darkness steal With gentle bleat, or with their lambs arise, Their dark and dewy eyes Uplooking into his; the cormorants green, Which ranged in black rows preen Their dusky plumage, at his footstep's sound Turn snake-like necks around, But rise not; o'er his head the white terns fly With shrill unceasing cry; And out of caverns come the rock-doves fleet, Alighting at his feet! Across the waters darts a shaft supreme Of strange and heavenly gleam, That doth his consecrated form enfold Like to a robe of gold,— While all the Ocean gladdeneth anew, Stretch'd bright beneath the blue. But what is this he findeth on his way, Here, where the golden ray Falleth on sands 'neath crimson crags that rise Dark 'gainst the great blue skies? What is this shape that, breathing soft and deep, Lies on its side asleep, Here on the strand where drifted sea-weeds cling? Is it some occan thing. Crept from the emerald darkness of the brine To bask i' the summer shine? Is it some gentle monster whose green home Lies far below the foam? Softly he sleeps, while on his closëd eyes The summer sunlight lies; Around his face, that seemeth wildly fair, Hang tawny locks of hair, On dusky shoulders falling loosely down; And lo, his cheeks are brown With kisses of the sun, and round his limbs A light like amber swims Divinely clear; and by his side is thrown A spear of walrus-bone, A bear-skin blanket, and a seal-hide thong; So sleeps he, brown and strong; And nought that lieth upon land or sea Seemeth more strange than he, Like some wild birth of ocean wash'd to land, And cast upon the sand With many a drifting weed and waif beside. ‘O Mother!’ Balder cried, Suddenly falling on his bended knee, ‘What shape is this I see? It sleeps—it breathes—it lives!’ And Frea said, Scarce turning her proud head, ‘It is a mortal man not worth thy care! Ev'n as the birds of the air They are born, they gladden, and they come and go.’ But Balder, stooping low, Passing soft fingers o'er the sleeper's side, And smiling sweetly, cried, ‘Awake, awake!’ and gently from the strand He raised one strong brown hand. ‘Hush!’ said the pallid goddess, sighing deep, ‘Lest he awake from sleep, And touch him not, lest from his mortal breath Thou know'st the taint of Death.’ ‘Death!’ Balder echoed with a quick sharp pain; And Frea spake again, ‘Nought on this nether sphere which foster'd thee, But drinks mortality; Fade not the leaf, the lily, and the rose? Yea, and the oak-tree knows Only its season;—in their seasons all Are fashion'd, fade, and fall— Birds on the boughs, and beasts within the brake, Yea, ev'n the hawk and snake, Are born to perish; and this creature shares An earthly lot like theirs.’ She paused; for suddenly in the bright sun-ray God Balder's cheeks grew gray And sunken—his eyes dim;—a moment's space Across his troubled face Pass'd darkness. Frea quail'd. A moment more, And that strange shade pass'd o'er, And Balder's looks again grew beautiful. O'erhead, as white as wool, The calm clouds melted in the burning blue; Beneath, the great seas grew Stiller and calmer, while the immortal one Stood dreaming in the sun, On that dark sleeper fixing eyes grown bright With heavenly love and light. ‘O come!’ the goddess cried, and took his hand. Along the shining strand They pass'd, but evermore god Balder's face Turn'd backward to the place Where he had left the weary wight asleep. Then, as beside the Deep They wander'd slowly onward, Frea told Strange tales and legends old Of living men, and how they came to be, And how they bend the knee To gods they know not, till beneath the sun They die, and all is done. And ever her finger pointed as she spoke To wreaths of light-blue smoke Upcurling heavenward o'er the sleeping seas From fishing villages. Love in his heart and wonder on his brow, Bright Balder hearken'd now In silence. ‘Far beyond those lonely woods And these sea-solitudes, Peopling the dark Earth, living forms ilke these Gather as thick as bees:— Shapen like gods, yet perishable; born For ever night and morn, And night and morn for ever vanishing. An old dark doom doth cling Around them and all kindred things that bloom Out of the green world's womb. Heed them not thou! To gods they are no more Than singing birds that soar A little flight, and fall. Tho' for a space, Rear'd in a lowly place, Thou hast known, as mortals know, Earth's shade and shine, Another lot is thine!— To sit among the gods, on heights supreme, Beyond Man's guess or dream!’ III. THE HEAVENWARD JOURNEY. I. The Goddesses. There is a valley by the northern sea, O'ershadow'd softly by eternal hills And canopied by the ethereal blue, Above it silently for ever gleam Cold peaks of ice and snow, and over these The wind goes, and the shadows of the wind; While far below, the hollows of the vale Are strewn most deep with heather and with thyme, And weeping willows hang their silken hair O'er dusky tarns with summer lilies sown; And from these tarns smooth tracts of greensward slope Until they blend with silvern sands that kiss The foam-white lips of the still sleeping sea. Into that valley by a secret way, The goddess guided her immortal son. Long had they wander'd, o'er the realms of snow, Thro' forests vast, down desolate ravines; And still, where'er they stept, before their feet A wind of brightness like a river ran, And rippled softly into grass and flowers,— So that they walked on rainbows with no rain, And under heaven made heaven beneath their feet. At last their path wound upward, while again They trod the white snows of the topmost peaks, And saw beneath them, faint and far away, The secret valley: purple woods of pine, Crags of wild umbrage lit by flashing falls, Smooth emerald lawns; and beyond all, the sea. And lo! as Balder gazed, that valley fair Grew fairer—on its sleep his brightness fell As benediction—and in saffron light It swam below him like a sunset cloud. Down from the lonely heights whereon he stood A snow-white cataract, like a naked god With plumes of silver plunging from a peak Into a purple ocean, headlong flash'd; Then, lost among the dark green pine-tree tops, Sounded unseen, mingling its far-off voice With the deep murmur of the wind-swept boughs. From rocky shelf to shelf, with golden moss Enwrought and fringëd with dwarf willow trees, They now descended in the torrent's track, And plunging swiftly downward found a path Thro' the cool darkness of the shadowy woods; But as they went the dusky forest way Grew brighter, ever flash'd to softer green The green leaves, and the sward to sunnier hues, Till from the leafy umbrage they emerged, And Balder saw a vision fairer far Than ever poet fabled in a dream. Beside those waters, on those emerald lawns Basking in one eternal summer day, Lay goddesses divine with half-closed eyes Gazing out seaward on the crimson isles Sown in the soft haze of the summer deep. And there they wove white runes to win the hearts Of gods and men, while o'er their happy heads Eternity hung steadfast as a star. Some stretch'd upon the scented greensward lay Moveless and wonderfully robed in white; Some sitting silent by the dusky tarns Look'd upward, with their faces dim as dream; Some musing stood, their eyes upon the sea, Their thoughts afar; and many up and down Along the quiet greensward paced and mused. There was no laughter as of maiden voices, No sound like human singing: all was still— Still as a heartbeat, silent as a sleep. But when from the green shadow of the woods Immortal Balder in his beauty came, And stood irresolute in light divine Gazing upon that wonder of white life, There was a cry of startled handmaidens Flocking round goddesses most marble pale. All to their feet had risen, and one supreme Tall shape with mailëd plates upon her breast, A skirt blood-red, and in her hand a spear, Stood, while pale virgins crouch'd around her feet, Confronting Balder with black eyes of fire. Lithe was she as a serpent, lithe and tall, Her dark skin glimmering bronzëd in the sun, Her eyebrows black drawn down, and as the beam Of Balder's beauty struck upon her frame, She raised her spear, and seem'd in act to strike; But Frea, coming stately from the shade, Cried, ‘Hold!’ and Rota (for 'twas she whose soul Delights in sowing strife 'mong weary men) Paused frowning, and the virgins at her feet Look'd up amazed. ‘Whom bring'st thou here?’ she cried— ‘What shape is this, with pale blue human eyes, Yet more than human brightness, venturing Where never foot of earthborn thing hath fared?’ And Frea answer'd gently, ‘Harm him not! Nor give him chilly greeting, sister mine— Kin is he to immortal gods and thee— 'Tis Balder! my son Balder!’ At the word The wind of that old prophecy arose And for a moment like a fever'd breath Faded across those lawns and sleeping pools; And blown from group to group of whiterobed forms, From goddess on to goddess, echoed low The name of ‘Balder,’ till it reached the sands, And on the far-off foam did die away In low sad echoes of the mighty main. Then Balder with a heavenly look advancing Shone on the place, and Rota dropt her spear, Still darkening, as in wonder and in scorn She gazed upon him, crying, ‘Then he lives! Woe to the race of Asa since he lives! Why comes he here?’ And Balder, with a voice As sweet as fountains falling, made reply, ‘I seek my sisters and my kin divine, And thou art of them!’ and he reach'd out hands, Smiling! As Rota stood irresolute, Half-angry, half-disarm'd by his sweet eyes, Another shape most fair and wonderful In snow-white robe array'd thro' which her limbs Shone with a rosy and celestial ray, Cried ‘Balder!’ in a voice so strange and deep It fell upon the fountains of his heart Like sudden light; and two serene large eyes Shone clear as clearest stars before his sight. ‘Who speaketh?’ Balder cried, and the deep voice. Made answer, ‘O thou foster-child of earth, With eyes like tender harebells, and with flesh Bright as the body of a mortal man, Dost thou not know me?—I am Gefion, Whose touch could make thee fruitful as a tree That drops ripe fruit at every kiss o' the wind.’ And Balder would have answer'd eagerly, But Frea now uplifting a white hand With queenly gesture, raised her voice and said, ‘O sisters! goddesses! O lilies fair Blown in the still pools of eternity! Be silent for a space, and for a space Gaze on my son whom to your bowers I bring For benediction; now, behold, he lives, Immortal as yourselves and beautiful As any star that in the heaven of heavens Hangs luminous, a lamp for mortal eyes. Him in the secret furrows of the Earth I cast like seed, while far away the storm Flash'd to a portent, and I wove my rune: That neither wind nor snow nor any touch Of god or goddess might disturb his growth From season unto season, while he rose Ev'n as a flower from the sweet-soilëd earth. There came unto his making leaf and flower, The soft rain and the shadow of the rain, The sundew and the moondew, and the gleam Of starlight, and the glowlight on the grass. To secret things my hands committed him, And strangely he hath thriven since that hour, Ev'n as a leaf is fashion'd, ev'n as the hair Of the long grass is woven, wondrously! And thus, his brow bright with the balms of Earth, He stands complete, his Father's child, my son. O look upon him! See his happy eyes! And tell me that ye love him, and in turn Will bless him, shielding him upon your breasts If ever evil hour to him should come. Oh, that sad rune we fear'd of old is false! For gentle is he as the gentle things Which foster'd him, too blest and beautiful To be a terror or a grief to gods.’ She ceased; and Gefion thro' her loosen'd hair Smiled, and stern Rota's look grew tenderer. Then, stretch'd her listless length upon the grass, Her dark face glowing brightly in the sun, Upon one elbow leaning, sun-tanned Eir Raised with quick wicked laugh her root and knife, Saying, ‘O Frea, had I found him there Fall'n like a flower in the dark arms of Earth, This knife had made an end; but since he stands Full-grown and fair, immortal, and thy son, I bid him welcome!’—As she spake, the eyes Of Balder fell upon the root and knife, And lo, the knife gleam'd as a brand of gold, While the black root, moist with the dews of earth, Trembled, and blossom'd into light green leaves! Then trembling, Eir arose, and stood her height, While gazing full into her troubled eyes, Bright Balder moved to embrace her silently. But as he gently came there interposed A wonder of new brightness,—such a shape, So perfect in divine white loveliness, As never mortal yet beheld and lived. And Balder trembled, and his bosom heaved With an exceeding sweetness strange and new, While close to his there came a shining face, Still as a sunbeam, dimmer than a dream. And Freya, for 'twas she whose touch is life To happy lovers and to loveless men Is sickness and despair, said, breathing warm, While on her alabaster arms love's light Was flushing faint as thro' a rose's leaves, ‘Let all my sisters greet thee as they will, I love thee, Balder! since of lovely things Thou art the brightest and the loveliest!’ And lo! ere he was ware of her intent, Unto his cheek she prest a warm red mouth Kings of great empires would have swoon'd to touch, And poets heavenly-dower'd would have died To dream of kissing. Then thro' Balder ran A new miraculous rapture such as feels The dark Earth when the scented Summer leaps Full-blossom'd as a bridegroom to her arms; Such as musk-roses know when blown apart By sunbeams in mid-June; and Balder's sense Swoon'd, and he seem'd strewn o'er with fruit and flowers, And on his lids were touches like warm rain, And on his nostrils and his parted lips Delicious balm and spicy odours fell, And all his soul was like a young maid's frame Bathed in the warmth of love's first virgin dream. Then, as he trembled thro' and thro' his form With the last flush of that celestial fire, The goddesses around him flocking came, All giving welcome. Some into his eyes Gazed in such awe as pallid virgins feel For some mysterious splendour masculine They seek yet fear and shrink from as they touch. For Balder's loveliness in that bright place Was as the soft sheen of the summer moon Arising silvern in the cloudless west Above the sunset seas of orange gold; And there was trouble in his human eyes Most melancholy sweet,—trouble like tears, Of starlight, or the tremor of the dew. II. The Fruit of Life. They led him to a bank with moss inlaid, Close to the tranquil mirror of the sea, And thither came pale ocean handmaidens Singing to lutes of amber and of pearl, While ‘Love him, love him,’ cried the goddesses, ‘O love him, love him, he is beautiful!’ But Frea lifted up her hand, and cried, ‘Love is not all—swear against all things ill To watch him and protect him;’—and they cried, ‘We swear! we swear!’ Then bending over him With bright black eyeballs burning into his, Pale Rota touched his forehead with her spear, Crying ‘Live on! No touch of time shall cause One wrinkle on thy smooth unruffled brow!’ And Eir, low-laughing, held with tender teeth, Not bruising the fair skin, his naked arm, And murmur'd, ‘Strength and subtle force be thine, Drunk from my breath into thy deepest veins.’ And Gefion, with her large, sad, heavenly eyes Upgazing in his face, and one white hand Laid softly on his side, cried, ‘As a tree Be fruitful! Wheresoe'er thou wanderest, Fruitage go with thee and a thousand flowers!’ But Freya kiss'd him calmly on the brow, And whisper'd to him lower than the rest, ‘O Balder! my soul's gift is best of all— They bring thee life, but I have given thee love.’ And Balder sank into a dream. Much joy Made his sense drowsy, and with happy eyes He saw that mist of light and loveliness Enclose him, while he seem'd as one who swims Among the shallows of an orient sea. A voice like music woke him, and he saw Standing before him in light azure robes A shape that 'midst those others seem'd as dim And unsubstantial as a summer shade. Tall was she, and her wondrous sheen of hair Rain'd downward like the silvern willow's leaves, And on her mystic raiment blue as heaven There glimmer'd dewy drops like shining stars. Pale was she, with the pallor of wan waters That wash for evermore the cold white feet Of spectral polar moons; and when she spake, 'Twas low as sea-wash on the starlit sands And strange and far-away as sounds in sleep. ‘Balder!’ she sigh'd; and like a man who hears, Upstarting on his bed, some wondrous cry, Balder upstarted wildly listening. ‘Balder! O brother Balder, whose fair face, Ere yet I gazed upon it shining here, I knew thro' dark eternities of dream, See what I give thee! see what gentle gift Thy sister Ydun brings thee; more divine Than life's sweet breath, or the fair flame of love.’ So saying, from her veilëd breast she drew Mystical apples like to diamond seeds, So small to seeming that a score might lie In the pink hollow of an infant's hand. Each shone complete and pure as mother-o'-pearl Touch'd with prismat'c gleams of wondrous light, And unto each on the scarce visible stem There clung two perfect little leaves of gold. This secret fruit the gods and goddesses For ever feed on, evermore renewed; And in a garden desolate and dim Wash'd by the wild green sea of human graves, Pale Ydun plucks it, and none other may. ‘Eat!’ Ydun murmur'd—‘Balder, eat and live— This fruit shall slay the lingering taint of Earth Within thee, and preserve thee all divine.’ Then Balder reaching out his open'd hand Did take the fruit, and eating of the same, Which melted on his tongue like flakes of snow, He felt thro' all his limbs the rapturous thrill Of some supreme and unfamiliar life. So leaving all those luminous shapes behind, He took the hand of Ydun, kissing her As moonlight kisses dew; and side by side They wended down across the yellow sands,— And many hours they wander'd whispering low Close to the bright edge of that sleeping Sea. III. The City of the Gods. So Balder knew what mystical delights, What slumberous idleness and peace supreme Belong to the immortal goddesses; And not a goddess in those golden walks But loved the human light in Balder's face. At last there came a day (if day might come Where suns sank never in the crystal sea) When mighty Frea said, ‘The time is nigh To say farewell—much yet remains to do, A weary path to follow, ere thy seat Among immortal creatures is secure.’ And Balder smiled, for of those shining groves His soul was weary tho' he knew it not;— Ev'n Freya's kiss was chiller on his cheek, And Gefion's face seem'd less serenely fair, And only Ydun still had power to soothe His spirit with her weirdly-woven runes. And Balder said, ‘O Mother, sweet it is To dwell among the immortals in these bowers, But to fare on is better, and I seem Ev'n as a cloud whose feet may never rest, But still must wander, and it knows not whither.’ And so from that fair valley silently They pass'd, and up the mountain sides, and down Thro' other prospects less divinely fair. And from the valley they had left the face Of Balder slowly faded like a star, Forgotten, dwindled from the drowsy dream Of those great slumberous-lidded goddesses. From that bright realm's serene eternity All forms that are not present fade away Like shadows stealing o'er a summer stream. Yea even Freya did forget his eyes, And gazed straight out at the unchanging sea Smiling all calm as if he had not been; And only Ydun did remember him, Writing his name upon the yellow sands And weaving it all round with subtle runes. . . . But far away beyond those secret realms, Still northward, thro' the wastes where nothing lives, The goddess guided Balder, till at last Into their faces flash'd the polar fires; So that the streams were purpled and the heights Took deeper crimson gleams, and overhead The stars were quench'd in amethyst and gold. Then Frea pointed with her hand, and cried, ‘Behold the City of the Gods!’ They stood Upon the verge of a vast Sea of Ice, So rough, so sown with berg and drift, it seem'd An ocean frozen in the midst of storm Before the surge could break, the waves could fall. Still was it 'neath the gleaming lights of heaven, Silent and awful, sleeping with no stir, In one vast gleam of crimson bright as blood Cast on it from afar. For lo! beyond, Rose Asgard, the great City of the Gods, For ever burnt to ashes night by night And dawn by dawn for evermore renew'd. And mortals when they see from out their caves The City crumbling with a thousand fires Cry, ‘Lo, the Sunset!’—and when evermore They mark it springing up miraculous From its own ashes strewn beside the sea, Cry, ‘Lo, the Sunrise!’ There, within its walls The great gods strive in thickening fumes of fight, Gathering together bloody ghosts of men; And when the great towers tremble and the spires Shoot earthward and the fiery ashes smoke, The gods exult a little space, and wave Their brands for all the vales of earth to see; But when the ashes blacken, and the moon Shines on the City's embers, silently They creep into their starry tents and sleep,— Till like a rose unfolding leaf by leaf, The immortal City rises! And behold! There, far across the silent frozen Deep, They saw the glimmer of the topmost towers, Fading and changing in the lurid light Of their own terrible consuming flame; And shadows to and fro amid the gleam Pass'd, smiting shadows, and from out the heavens There came a far-off sound as of a sea. Still onward, walking now with wearier feet The ice of that great Ocean, they pursued Their solitary way, and as they went. With shadows ever lengthening to the south, The City sank consuming, till its towers Just touch'd with gold the red horizon fringe; And in the darkening ether over it A star sprang like a spirit clad in mail, And sat without a sound upon its throne, Down-gazing; and the empty heavens and air Were troubled still with melancholy light, Wherein the opening lamps of night were swung Pure golden, twinkling without beams. At last, When of that City little more remain'd Than splendour from its ashes fading slow, They reach'd one mighty gateway crumbling down Ev'n as a cloud that clings upon a crag, And passing in they found the golden streets All chill and desolate and strewn with shade; For no' quick foot of any living thing, Mortal or god, trod there; but all around Grew silence, and the luminous eyes of stars. Then Frea said, ‘Call now upon the Father!’ And Balder, standing bright and beautiful Like to a marble column wrought with gold, All kindled with the shadows of the fire, Rose on the ashes of the City and cried, ‘Father!’ when glory grew about his brow, And on his breast and arms the light was shed, Staining their alabaster. So he stood, Tall-statured, luminous, supremely fair, Watch'd by the closing eyes of all the world. And suddenly, in answer to his cry, A fierce aurora of pale faces flash'd Out of the night of the extremest north. And Frea cried aloud, ‘Almighty gods! Behold your brother Balder! Father in Heaven, Behold thy Son!’ From out the north there came A murmur, and across the skies there swept A trouble as of wildly waving hands. Then Frea cried to Balder, ‘Call again!’ And Balder, shining still most beautiful, And stretching out his arms to the black north, Cried ‘Father!’ Suddenly the stars were quench'd, And heavy as a curtain fell the night. IV. The Voice of the Father. Then Frea said, ‘O Balder, best beloved, My heart fails, and my weary spirit swoons. Fare on alone, and enter unafraid The presence of the Father.’ As she spake, Her face he saw not, but he felt her hands Clinging around him, while his own fair face, Amid that sudden darkness, shone serene, Fearless and gentle, and his beauteous limbs Gleam'd with the lustre of celestial life. ‘Mother,’ he answer'd, ‘why is all so dark? And where is he thou namest, that mine eyes May look upon him?’ From the blacken'd ground Her voice sobbed answer, saying, ‘Even now His shadow is upon us. Pass thou on, Glide silent thro' the phantom groves of gods, And stand in thine immortal loveliness, With eyes divine on his, before the throne. Here will I linger, praying close to the earth, Till thou returnest.’ Shining like a star, Spake Balder, ‘All is dim, and I discern No pathway and no bourne;’ but with clear voice Uplifted like a swan's that flies thro' storm, He call'd, ‘Where art thou, Father? It is I, Balder thy Son!’ As when the great seas roar Suck'd in thro' weedy rocks and undercaves With surging sorrow drearily prolong'd In hoarse and billowy breaths of solemn sound, Ev'n so that darkness murmur'd and a voice Came thund'rous out of heaven with no words. And Frea cried, ‘Thou hearest! Hark, he calls— Follow that murmur out into the dark, And it shall guide thee to the Father's feet.’ Silently, softly smiling, with no fear, Balder pass'd on; and as one gropes his way Occanward guided by the ocean's voice, He faded slowly forth into the night. V. Balder's Return. There close to the earth she waited, crouching down 'Mid the cold ashes of the sunken City, While closing round her like to prison walls The deep impenetrable darkness grew. And soon it shed a heavy, weary rain, That clung upon her, chilling soul and sense, Cold as a corpse's lips; and all the while, As a bird listens from its folded wings, She listen'd! But the only sound she heard Was the low murmur of that weary rain, Which spread wet fingers o'er the shuddering heavens, And drearily drew down the rainy lids Over the gentle eyes of all the stars. Silent she lay and hearken'd, till her soul Had lost all count of time and faded back Into its own sad, dumb eternity. . . . At last she stirred like one that wakes from sleep. The rain had ceased, the darkness to the north Had lifted, and her eyes beheld afar, Beneath the glimmer of the northern night, The brightness of the god's returning feet. Slowly, like one whose heart is heavy; slowly, Like one that muses sadly as he moves; Slowly, with darkness brooding at his back, Came Balder, and his coming far away Was ev'n as moonlight when the moon is sad On misty nights of March; and when again He pass'd across the ashes of the City, And she who bare him could behold his face, 'Twas spectral white, and in his heavenly eyes There dwelt a shadowy pain. Ev'n as a man Who passing thro' the barrows of the slain Hath seen the corpses sit at dead of night Gazing in silence from their own green graves; Or as a maiden who hath seen a wraith And knoweth that her shroud is being woven, Came Balder out of heaven: still divine, And beautiful, but ah! how sorrowful; Still bright, but with a light as sadly fair, Compared to that first splendour of the dawn, As moonshine is to sunshine; on his brow The shade of some new sorrow, in his eyes The birth of some new pity; as a god, Yet ghost-like, with deep glamour in his gaze, Slowly, with faltering footsteps, Balder came. Then Frea rose in silence, very pale, For on her soul beholding Balder's face Some desolate anticipation fell, And turn'd her eyes on his, stretching her hands To hold him and to embrace him, keen to hear His message; but he spake not when her arms Were wound about him and upon his brow Her soft kiss fell; vacant his sad eyes seem'd, As if they gazed on something far away. Then Frea sobbed in agony of heart, ‘Son, hast thou seen thy brethren?’ and again, ‘Son, hast thou seen thy Father?’ Yet a space His lips were silent, and his eyes were blank, But when again and yet again her tongue Had framed the same fond question, Balder said, In a low voice and a weary, ‘I have seen My brethren and my Father!’ Like a man Smit thro' and thro' with sudden sense of cold, He shiver'd. Then the goddess, mad to see The light of agony on that well-loved face, Clung to him wailing, ‘Balder! my Son Balder! Why is thy look so sick, thy soul so weary? What hast thou done and seen? what sight of heaven Hath made thee sad?’—and Balder answer'd low, ‘O Mother! I have dream'd another dream— I have seen my brethren in a dream—have seen My brethren and my Father; and it seems From that strange trance I have not waken'd yet, But that I still am darkling in my dream, The breath of gods about me, and the eyes Of gods upon me! Patience—question not— The light is coming, and my soul is waking— My dream grows clear, and I shall soon remember All that mine eyes have seen, mine ears have heard.’ Then on that City's ashes side by side Sat son and mother, two colossal shapes, Silent, in shadow; but the eyes of heaven Were opening above, and to the south They saw the white seas flash with glittering bergs In fitful glimmers to the windy night. And when a little space had pass'd away The god spake softly, saying, ‘All is clear, My sorrow and my dream; and Mother, now I know those things which seem'd so sad and dark. Ah! woe is me that I was ever born To be a terror and a grief to gods!’ Then Frea cried, ‘O Balder, unto whom Can all the promise of thy beauty bring Terror or grief? Nay, 'twas with looks serene To win the heart of heaven, that its wrath Might never turn against thee, and to mock With glory of thy human gentleness The prophecy of that ancestral rune, I bade thee go up beauteous and alone Before the darkness of the Father's face. Yet thou returnest barren of such joy As thou a god shouldst snatch from gods thy kin, First in thy plenitude beholding them; And on thy brow is sadness, not such peace As comes from consecration of a kiss Given by a Father to a son beloved In whom he is well pleased!’ Then once again Like a man smitten to the bone with cold, Bright Balder shiver'd, and his beautiful face Grew gray as any mortal's fix'd in death; And suddenly he cried, ‘O come away! Come back to those green woods where I was born. The ways of heaven are dreary, and the winds Of heaven blow chilly, and I fain would find A refuge and a home!’ But Frea moan'd, Turning her fair face northward in quick wrath, ‘Ay me thy dream—I read it, from mine own Most bitterly awaking. Woe to them! Woe to the Father and the gods thy kin! Out of thy mansion have they cast thee forth, Denying thee thy birthright and thy seat Up yonder at thy heavenly Father's side!’ But Balder, in a feeble voice and low, Said, ‘They denied me nought, those Shapes I saw Strangely as in a sleep; nay, but meseem'd They pointed at me with their spectral hands And waved me back, some with their raiment hems Hiding their faces; in their eyes I saw Not love but protestation absolute; And when I rose and named my Father's name, It seem'd creation rock'd beneath my feet And all the cloudy void above my head Trembled; and when I named my name, a voice Shriek'd “Balder!” and the naked vaults of heaven Prolong'd in desolation and despair The echoes of the word till it became As thunder! Then meseem'd I saw a hand, Gripping the fiery lightning suddenly, Strike at my head as if to smite me down; But tho' my frame was wrapt about with fire, I stood unscathed; and as I paused I saw, Confused as stormy shadows in the sea, Thrones gleaming, faces fading, starry shapes Coming and going darkly; and each time I call'd upon my Father, that great hand Flash'd down the fierce darts of the crimson levin, And from that darkness which I knew was he A voice came, and a cry that seem'd a curse, Until my soul was sicken'd and afraid. Then, for my heart was heavy, yearning still To look upon him and to feel at last The welcome of his consecrating kiss, I fell upon my knees, folded my hands Together, and I blest him;—when methought The voice wail'd, and the cry that seem'd a curse Re-echoed. Then came blackness more intense; And for a space my sense and sight seem'd lost, And when I woke I stood beside thee here, Holding thy hand and looking in thine eyes.’ Then Frea wail'd, ‘'Tis o'er! my hope is o'er! Thy Father loves thee not, but casts thee forth— Where wilt thou find a place to rest thy feet?’ But Balder answer'd, ‘Where the cushat builds Her nest amid green leaves, and where wild roses Hang lamps to light the dewy feet of dawn, And where the starlight and the moonlight slumber, Ev'n there, upon the balmy lap of Earth, Shall I not sleep again? O Mother, Mother! Pray to my Father that his soul may learn To love me in due season, while again Earthward we fare; and Mother, bless thou me, Me whom my heavenly Father blesseth not, With ministering hands before we go!’ Then Frea cried, blessing and kissing Balder, ‘Go thou,—the green Earth loves thee, and thy face Is as a lamp to all the gentle things Which mingled in thy making—Go thou down, But I will journey upward till I find The footstool of the Father. Night and day With prayers, with intercession of deep tears, With ministering murmurs, I will plead, Low-lying like a cloud around his feet, Thy cause, and the green Earth's which foster'd thee: That in a later season love may come In answer, and the Father fear no more To seat thee 'mong Immortals at his side. Go down, my child, my sunbeam, my bestborn, My Balder, who art still deem'd beautiful Save only in the heavenly Father's sight! And when all things have blest thee; when all forms Have gladden'd in thy glory; when all voices, The mountains and the rivers and the seas, The white clouds and the stars upon their thrones, Have known thy face and syllabled thy name; Come back again under the arch of heaven, Not as a suppliant but a conqueror, And take thy throne!’ The darkness far away Groan'd: and the great void answer'd; overhead Cluster'd the countless spheres of night, like eyes Downgazing; but beneath the goddess' feet Shot up dim gleams of dawn. Then bright as day Grew Balder, while his face, composed to peace, Turn'd earthward; and he stretch'd out eager arms To that belovëd land where he was born. ‘Farewell!’ he said, and softly kiss'd the mother; Then, while the goddess glided like a cloud Up heavenward, down to the dim Earth he pass'd Slowly, with luminous feet. . . . And when he came To that cold realm which belts the Frozen Sea, Behind his back the trumpets of the light Were faintly blown; a sudden sheen was thrown Behind him and around him, wondrously; Bright shone the lonely waste of plain and berg; And reaching that great cape of porphyry Which points with shadowy finger at the pole, He turn'd his shining face once more, and watch'd; While far away in the remotest north Bright Asgard, mystic City of the Gods, Was rising from its ashes till its spires Burnt golden in the rose-red arch of heaven. IV. BALDER'S RETURN TO EARTH. I. ‘Balder is Here.’ O who cometh sweetly With singing of showers?— The wild wind runs fleetly Before his soft tread, The sward stirs asunder To radiance of flowers, While o'er him and under A glory is spread— A white cloud above him Moves on thro' the blue, And all things that love him Are dim with its dew: The lark is upspringing, The merle whistles clear, There is sunlight and singing, For Balder is here! He walks on the mountains, He treads on the snows; He loosens the fountains And quickens the wells; He is filling the chalice Of lily and rose, He is down in the valleys And deep in the dells— He smiles, and buds spring to him. The bright and the dark; He speaks, and birds sing to him, The finch and the lark,— He is down by the river, He is up by the mere, Woods gladden, leaves quiver, For Balder is here. There is some divine trouble On earth and in air— Trees tremble, brooks bubble, Ants loosen the sod; Warm footfalls awaken Whatever is fair; Sweet rain-dews are shaken To quicken each clod. The wild rainbows o'er him Are melted and fade, The grass runs before him Thro' meadow and glade; Green branches close round him, The leaves whisper near— ‘He is ours—we have found him— Bright Balder is here!’ The forest glows golden Where'er he is seen, New flowers are unfolden, New voices arise; Flames flash at his passing From boughs that grow green, Dark runlets gleam, glassing The stars of his eyes. The Earth wears her brightest Wherever he goes, The hawthorn its whitest, Its reddest the rose; The days now are sunny, The white storks appear, And the bee gathers honey, For Balder is here. He is here on the heather, And here by the brook, And here where together The lilac boughs cling; He is coming and going With love in his look, His white hand is sowing Warm seeds, and they spring! He has touch'd with new silver The lips of the stream, And the eyes of the culver Are bright from his beam, He has lit the great lilies Like lamps on the mere; All happy and still is, For Balder is here. Still southward with sunlight He wanders away— The true light, the one light, The new light, is he! With music and singing The mountains are gay, And the peace he is bringing Spreads over the sea. All night, while stars twinkling Gleam down on the glade, His white hands are sprinkling With harebells the shade; And when day hath broken, All things that dwell near Will know, by that token, That Balder is here. In the dark deep dominions Of pine and of fir, Where the dove with soft pinions Sits still on her nest, He sees her, and by her The young doves astir, And smiling sits nigh her, His hand on her breast; The father-dove lingers With love in its eyes, Alights on his fingers, And utters soft cries, And the sweet colours seven Of the rainbow appear On its neck, as in heaven, Now Balder is here. He sits by a fountain Far up near the snow, And high on the mountain The wild reindeer stand; On crimson moss near to him They feed walking slow, Or come with no fear to him, And eat from his hand. He sees the ice turning To columns of gold. He sees the clouds burning On crags that were cold; The great snows are drifting To cataracts clear, All shining and shifting, For Balder is here. O who sitteth singing, Where sunset is red, And wild ducks are winging Against the dark gleam? It is he, it is Balder, He hangeth his head Where willow and alder Droop over the stream; And the purple moths find him And hover around, And from marshes behind him He hears a low sound: The frogs croak their greeting From swamp and from mere, And their faint hearts are beating, For Balder is here. The round moon is peeping Above the low hill; Her white light, upcreeping Against the sun's glow, On the black shallow river Falls silvern and chill, Where bulrushes quiver And wan lilies grow. The black bats are flitting, Owls pass on soft wings, Yet silently sitting He lingers and sings— He sings of the Maytime, Its sunlight and cheer, And the night like the daytime Knows Balder is here. He is here with the moonlight, With night as with day, The true light, the one light, The new light, is he; The moon-bows above him Are melted away, And the things of night love him, And hearken and see. He sits and he ponders, He walks and he broods, Or singing he wanders 'Neath star-frosted woods; And the spheres from afar, light His face shining clear: Yea, the moonlight and starlight Feel Balder is here. He is here, he is moving On mountain and dale, And all things grow loving, And all things grow bright: Buds bloom in the meadows, Milk foams in the pail, There is scent in the shadows, And sound in the light: O listen! he passes Thro' valleys of flowers, With springing of grasses And singing of showers. Earth wakes—he has called her, Whose voice she holds dear; She was waiting for Balder, And Balder is here! II. 'Mid mountains white by rainbows spanned. Upon his knees he sank, And melted in his hollow'd hand The stainless snows, and drank. And far beneath in mists of heat Great purple valleys slept, And flashing bright beneath his feet The loosen'd cataracts leapt. Down to those happy vales he drew Where men and women dwell, And white snow melted, green grass grew, Where'er his footprints fell. Then night by night and day by day His deepest joy was found In watching happy things of clay And hearing human sound. All human eyes to him were sweet, He loved the touch of hands, He kissed the print of human feet Upon the soft sea-sands. Most silently he went and came, With mild and blissful mien, Bright as a beam his face would flame Amid the forests green. To timid mortals passing by He seemed a vision fair, But little children oft drew night, And let him smooth their hair; And witless men would come to him With wild and eldritch cries, And lying in the moonbeams dim Would gaze into his eyes! His voice was in the lonely wood, And by the nameless stream,— He shed in silent solitude The peaceful rays of dream. From vale to vale he went, and blest The wild beast and the bird,— While deep within the glad Earth's breast The founts of being stirred. . . . He sat down in a lonely land Of mountain, moor, and mere, And watch'd, with chin upon his hand, Dark maids that milk'd the deer. And while the sun set in the skies, And stars shone in the blue, They sang sweet songs, till Balder's eyes Were sad with kindred dew. He passed along the hamlets dim With twilight's breath of balm, And whatsoe'er was touch'd by him Grew beautiful and calm. The old man sitting on the grass Look'd up 'neath hoary hair, And felt some heavenly presence pass And gladden'd unaware! He came unto a hut forlorn As evening shadows fell, And saw the man among the corn, The woman at the well. And entering the darken'd place, He found the cradled child; Stooping he lookt into its face, Until it woke and smiled! Then Balder passed into the night With soft and shining tread, The cataract called upon the height, The stars gleam'd overhead. He raised his eyes to those cold skies Which he had left behind,— And saw the banners of the gods Blown back upon the wind. He watch'd them as they came and fled, Then his divine eyes fell. ‘I love the green Earth best,’ he said, ‘And I on Earth will dwell!’ III. All Things Blest by Balder. So when his happy feet had wander'd far, When all the birds had brighten'd and his hand Had linger'd on the brows of all the beasts, He came among the valleys where abode Mortals that walk erect upon the ground. First, southward passing, he beheld those men Who, where the snow for ever lieth, dwell In caverns of the ground and swathe their limbs In skins of beasts: these felt his glory pass, But knew it not, because their eyes were dim With many nights of darkness. Round their doors Sorrel blood-red he cast and saxifrage, And singing passed away! Then roam'd he on, Past porphyry and greenstone crags that line Limitless oceans of unmelting ice, Until he enter'd valleys kindlier That redden'd into ruby as he came; And in among the countless deer he stole, Marking their horns with golden moss, and singing A strange soft song their souls could understand. Then as the Earth grew fairer, presently He came beneath the shade of forest leaves,— And deep among the emerald depths he found Those mortal men who dwell in woods and build Their dwellings of the scented boughs of trees. And often, with his cheek upon his hand, Balder would sit and watch the smoke of fire Upcurling thro' the branches heavenward, While to and fro in sunshine passed the shapes Of men and women. Most he loved to mark Those forms which gods made fairest, and to hear Those voices gods made sweetest; but his hand, Falling unseen, was gentlest on the hair Of children and of hoary aged men. Then Balder said, ‘The Earth is fair, and fair, Yea fairer than the stormy lives of gods, The lives of gentle dwellers on the Earth; For shapen are they in the likenesses Of goddesses and gods, and on their limbs Sunlight and moonlight mingle, and they lie Happy and calm in one another's arms O'er-canopied with greenness; and their hands Have fashion'd fire that springeth beautiful Straight as a silvern lily from the ground, Wondrously blowing; and they measure out Glad seasons by the pulses of the stars. O Spirit whom I know not, tho' I fear Thy shadow on my soul where'er I go, Almighty Father, tho' thou lov'st me not, I love thy children! I could sit all hours, Just looking into their still heavenly eyes, Holding their hands! Most dear they are to me, Because they are my brethren;—beautiful, My brethren and thy children!’ O'er his head The blue sky darken'd, and a thund'rous voice Murmur'd afar off,—and in great black drops Came out of heaven the blind and desolate rain. But Balder gazing upward reach'd out arms And bless'd it as it fell; and lo, it grew Silvern and lovely as an old man's hair! And scents came out of the rich-soilëd earth, And all the boughs were glad and jewel-hung, Till very softly, very silently, The shower ceased, with kisses tremulous On Balder's lifted hands! Even so he turn'd The saddest things to beauty. With his face Came calm and consecration; and the Earth Uplifting sightless eyes in a new joy, Answer'd the steadfast smile of the still heavens With one long look of peace. In those strange days The wild wind was his playmate,—yea, the blast New-loosen'd by the very hands of gods Leapt to him like a lamb, and at his smile Fell at his feet, and slept. Then out of heaven Came lightnings, from whose terror every face Of humankind was hidden,—meteors, flames, Forms of the fiery levin, such as wait For ever at the angry beck of gods. But Balder stood upon a promontory, And saw them shining o'er the open sea, And on the fields of ether crimson'd red; And lo, he lfted up a voice and cried, ‘O beautiful wild children of the fire, Whence come ye? whither go ye? Be at peace, Come hither!’ and like soft white stingless snakes That crawl on grass, the fiery meteors came, Licking his feet in silence, looking up With luminous eyes! Ev'n as he conquer'd these, Heaven's fiery messengers, he tamed the hearts Of human things, and in the sun they sat Weaving green boughs, or wooing in the shade, Or leading home the white and virgin bride. For as the holy hunger and desire Came quickening in the hearts of birds and beasts, Ev'n so woke love within the hearts of men; And out of love came children; and the Earth Was merry with new creatures thronging forth Like ants that quicken on the sun-kist sod. IV. The Cry from the Ground. And Balder bends above them, glory-crown'd, Marking them as they creep upon the ground, Busy as ants that toil without a sound, With only gods to mark. But list! O list! what is that cry of pain, Faint as the far-off murmur of the main? Stoop low and hearken, Balder! List again! ‘Lo! Death makes all things dark!’ Ay me, it is the earthborn souls that sigh, Coming and going underneath the sky; They move, they gather, clearer grows their cry— O Balder, bend, and hark! The skies are still and calm, the seas asleep, In happy light the mortal millions creep, Yet listen, Balder!—still they murmur deep, ‘Lo! Death makes all things dark.’ [Oh, listen! listen!] ‘Blessed is the light, We love the golden day, the silvern night, The cataracts leap, the woods and streams are bright, We gladden as we mark. ‘Crying we come, but soon our cheeks are dried— We wander for a season happy-eyed, And we forget how our gray sires have sigh'd, “Lo! Death makes all things dark.” ‘For is the sun not merry and full of cheer? Is it not sweet to live and feel no fear? To see the young lambs leaping, and to hear The cuckoo and the lark? ‘Is toil not blest, is it not blest to be? To climb the snows, to sail the surging sea, To build our saeters where our flocks roam free? But Death makes all things dark. ‘Is love not blest, is it not brave and gay With strong right hand to bear one's bride away, To woo her in the night time and the day With no strange eyes to mark? ‘And blest are children, springing fair of face Like gentle blossoms in the dwelling-place; We clasp them close, forgetting for a space Death makes the world so dark. ‘And yet though life is glad and love divine, This Shape we fear is here i' the summer shine,— He blights the fruit we pluck, the wreath we twine, And soon he leaves us stark. ‘He haunts us fleetly on the snowy steep, He finds us as we sow and as we reap, He creepeth in to slay us as we sleep,— Ah! Death makes all things dark! ‘Yea, when afar over our nets hang we, He walks unto us even on the sea; The wind blows in his hair, the foam flics free O'er many a sinking bark! ‘Pity us, gods, and take this god away, Pity us, gods, who made us out of clay, Pity us, gods, that our sad souls may say, “Bright is the world, which Death a space made dark.”’ V. The Shadow on the Earth. Now all his peace was poison'd and he found No solace in the shining eyes of day, Starlight and moonlight now seem'd sorrowful, And in his soul there grew the sense of tears. For wheresoe'er he wander'd, whatsoe'er He gazed on, whether in the light or dark, Was troubled by a portent. Evermore, Listening to nature's sad unceasing moan, Balder remember'd that pale haunting Shape Which he had seen in those primæval woods Where he was foster'd by the happy Earth; And those sad tales the mother-goddess told Of mortal men, and how they waste and wane, Came back upon his life with fearful gleams. Yea, Balder's heart was heavy. All in vain He wove wild runes around the flowers and trees, And round the necks of beasts and gentle birds; For evermore the cold hand found them out, And evermore they darkly droop'd and died. This direful thing was on the helpless Earth, Unprison'd, unconfined. Before his face It faded, and before his eager touch Melted and changed, but evermore again It gather'd into dreadful lineaments, And passed with arms outreaching on its way. Then Balder lifted up his trembling hands To heaven, crying, ‘Father!’ and no sound Came from the frozen void; and once again, ‘O Mother, Mother!’ but pale Frea lay Stone-still in anguish at the Father's feet, And dared not answer; and he cried once more, ‘Gods, gods, immortal gods!’ when suddenly He saw across the open arctic heaven The hosts of Asgard, ev'n as sunset clouds That drift confusedly in masses bright, Trooping, with blood-red rays upon their heads, To fight against the meteor snakes that flash Far northward in the white untrodden wastes. They passed, they saw not, but he heard their feet Afar as muffled thunder, and he cried, ‘O Slayers of the snake, immortal gods, Come hither and slay the slayer, that the world May rest in peace!’ If ever his faint cry Reach'd to their ears, the dark gods only smiled, With smiles like sullen lightning on the lips Of tempest; and he found no comfort there. Nor from the mouths of flower, or bird, or tree, Sea-fern, or sighing shell upon the shore, Came any answer when he question'd low, ‘What is this thing ye fear? who sent it hither, This shape which moaning mortals christen Death?’ But from the darkness of his own heart's pity, And from all things in unison—the gloom Of midnight, and the trouble of the clouds, From sunless waters, solitary woods, There came a murmur, ‘None can answer thee, Save him thou followest with weary feet!’ Wherefore he wander'd on, and still in vain Sought Death the slayer. Into burial-places, Heapen with stones and seal'd with slime of grass. He track'd him, found him sitting lonely there Like one that dreams, his dreadful pitiless eyes Fix'd on the sunset star. Or oftentimes Beheld him running swiftly like a wolf Who scents some stricken prey along the ground. Or saw him into empty huts crawl slow, And while the man and woman toiled i' the field, Gaze down with stony orbs a little space Upon the sickly babe, which open'd eyes, And laugh'd, and spread its little faded hands In elfin play. Nay, oft in Balder's sight The form seem'd gentle, and the fatal face Grew beautiful and very strangely fair. Yet evermore while his swift feet pursued, Darkling it fled away, and evermore Most pitiful rose cries of beasts and birds, Most desolate rose moans of stricken men, Till Balder wept for sorrow's sake, and cried, ‘Help me, my Father!’ Even as he spake, A gray cloud wept upon the Earth, which wore A gentle darkness; and the wastes and woods, The mountains trembling in their hoary hair, The mighty continents and streams and seas, Uplifted a low voice of mystery And protestation. Then a wingëd wind Caught up the sound and bore it suddenly To the great gates of Asgard, so that all Within the shadowy City heard; and He Who sitteth far beyond upon his throne, Immortal, terrible, and desolate, Heard, but was silent; and no answer came, No help or answer, from the lips of heaven. VI. On the Heights—Evening. MOUNTAIN GIRL. Art thou a god? thy brow is shining so! O thou art beautiful! What is thy name? BALDER. Balder. GIRL. Now let me look into thy face. BALDER. Look. GIRL. How I love thee! BALDER. And thy name? GIRL. Snow-blossom. That is my mother standing at the door, Shading her face and gazing up the hill. I keep my mother's reindeer, and each night Milk them, and drive them to their pasturage. How clear thine eyes are! They are like that star Up yonder, twinkling on the snow! BALDER. Come hither! Thou hast bright hair like mine, and starry eyes, Snow-blossom, and a voice like falling water; Thy flesh is like the red snow and the white Mingled together softly, and thy breath Is scented like the fragrant thyme in flower. Mine eyes have look'd on many shapes like thine— Yet thou art fairest. GIRL. I am call'd Snow-blossom Because I am not brown like other maids, And when a little child I was so white! BALDER. Snow-lily! GIRL. They are calling—I must go— Come down with me, and by our saeter's fire Slumber this night, and ere thou liest down I'll sing to thee the strange old songs I know Of Death, and of the battle-fields of gods, And of the wondrous City where they dwell Yonder afar away! BALDER. What knowest thou Of Death or gods? GIRL. Only last winter tide I saw my father die: he drew one breath, Then went to sleep; but when we touch'd his hands They had no warmth, and his twain eyes were glazed, Gazing at something that we saw not. Then We wrapt him warm in skins and in his hands We set his seal-spear and his seal-hide thong, And placed him sitting in the sunless earth, Crouch'd resting on the ground with knees drawn up As many a night he sat beside the fire. And that the fierce white bear might find him not, We wall'd him up with earth and mighty stones, Seal'd tight with snow and water: then we said A prayer to the good gods, and left him there Where they might find him. BALDER. Hast thou seen that Death Which smote thy father? GIRL. Nay!—no mortal thing Sees him and lives. He walks about the Earth At his good will, and smites whate'er he lists, Both young and old. There is no spirit at all More strong than he! BALDER. Is he a god? GIRL. I know not. BALDER. And will thy father waken? GIRL. When the gods Find out his grave, and open up the stones, Then he will waken, and will join the hosts Of Hermod and of Thor; for he was brave, My father: he could keep his own, and ere He took my mother, with his spear he slew Her father and her brother, who were wroth Because they hated him; and evermore When he shed blood, he made his offering To Hermod and the rest. BALDER. And thou, Snow-blossom, Thou in thy turn wilt wed a mighty man, And bear strong children? GIRL. Yes!—a man of strength, Fair like my father. I would have him fierce As bears are, bearded, a seal-strangler, swift, And a great hunter with a boat and dogs. But I would have him very cunning too, Knowing old songs and wise at weaving runes, That in the season when the sun is fled We might be merry thro' the long cold nights Waiting for summer! BALDER. Hark! GIRL. It is my mother Calling again! Wilt thou not come? BALDER. Go thou! I shall fare further o'er the summer hills. Snow-blossom! Let me kiss thee ere thou goest! GIRL. Yes! BALDER. Now farewell! . . . How lightly down the height She leapeth with the leaping cataract, And now she turns and waves her little hand, And plunging down she fades. And in the world Dwell countless thousands beautiful as she, Happy and virgin, drinking with no pain The vital air of heaven! O pink flesh Over the warm nest of a singing heart Heap'd soft as blossoms! O strange starry eyes Of mortals, beautiful as mine! O flame Out of soft nostrils trembling, like the light From lips of flowers! O wonder of Earth's life, Why is it that the great gods chase thee down? Why is it that thou fallest evermore When thou art fairest? Up and down the world Each creature walks, and o'er each red mouth hangs Breath like a little cloud, faint smoke of breath Blown from the burning of the fire within. Great gods, if as they say ye fashion'd them, Why do ye suffer this wild wind of doom To wither what ye made so wonderful? The vale is dark, the snow-fields on the height Are purpled with the midnight. . . . . Steadfastly One lamp shines in the valley, and above The still star shines an answer. Slumber well, Snow-blossom! May no shadow of the gods Come near to trouble thee in thy repose! Sleep like immortal raiment wrap thee round, To charm away the rayless eyes of Death! VII. The Vow of Balder. Bright Balder cried, ‘Curst be this thing Which will not let man rest, Slaying with swift and cruel sting The very babe at breast! ‘On man and beast, on flower and bird, He creepeth evermore; Unseen he haunts the Earth; unheard He crawls from door to door. ‘I will not pause in any land, Nor sleep beneath the skies, Till I have held him by the hand And gazed into his eyes!’ V. BALDER'S QUEST FOR DEATH. I. He sought him on the mountains bleak and bare And on the windy moors; He found his secret footprints everywhere, Yea, ev'n by human doors. All round the deerfold on the shrouded height The starlight glimmer'd clear; Therein sat Death, wrapt round with vapours white Touching the dove-eyed deer. And thither Balder silent-footed flew, But found the phantom not; The rain-wash'd moon had risen cold and blue Above that lonely spot. Then as he stood and listen'd, gazing round In the pale silvern glow, He heard a wailing and a weeping sound From the wild huts below. He mark'd the sudden flashing of the lights, He heard cry answering cry— And lo! he saw upon the silent heights A shadowy form pass by. Wan was the face, the eyeballs pale and wild, The robes like rain wind-blown, And as it fled it clasp'd a naked child Unto its cold breast-bone. And Balder clutch'd its robe with fingers weak To stay it as it flew— A breath of ice blew chill upon his cheek, Blinding his eyes of blue. 'Twas Death! 'twas gone!—All night the shepherds sped, Searching the hills in fear; At dawn they found their lost one lying dead Up by the lone black mere; And lo! they saw the fatal finger-mark, Which reacheth young and old, Seal'd, livid still, upon its eyelids dark And round its nipples cold. Then Balder moan'd aloud and smote his breast, ‘O drinker of sweet breath, Curst be thy cruel lips! I shall not rest Until I clasp thee, Death!’ He track'd the footprints in the morning gray From rocky haunt to haunt. Far up the heights a wolf had crost Death's way; It lay there, lean and gaunt. He reach'd the highest snows and found them strewn With bleaching bones of deer. . . . Night came again,—he listen'd 'neath the moon Shining most cold and clear. Beneath him stretch'd vast valleys green and fair, Still in the twilight shine, With great waste tarns and cataracts hung in air, And woods of fir and pine; And on the tarns lay dim red dreams of day The midnight sun cast there,— Sunlight and moonlight blending in one rav Of mother-o'-pearl most fair. He wander'd down thro' woods that flinged the snows, Down cliffs with ivy crown'd, He passed by lonely tarns whence duskly rose Great cranes, and hover'd round. He paused upon a crimson crag, and lo! Deep down at the crag's foot, The Shape he sought, in shadow, far below, With folded wings, sat mute! Ev'n as a vulture of the east it seem'd Brooding on something dead; Dark was the form on which its cold eyes gleam'd, And still and heavy as lead. Then Balder swung himself from tree to tree, And reach'd the fatal place! . . . The phantom fled as silent wild things flee, But a white human face Gleam'd from the ground; and Balder's glory shone On a wild cowherd's hair! Too late—his cheeks were chill—his breath was gone— His bosom torn and bare. The Shape unseen had cast him o'er the steep, Down, down, the abysses dim,— Then, as an eagle followeth a sheep, Had flutter'd after him! His bearskin dress was bloody; in his grip He clutch'd a cowherd's horn; His eyes were glazed, and on his stainëd lip Death's kisses lay forlorn. But Balder touch'd him and his face grew fair, Shining beneath the skies, Yea, Balder crost his hands, and smooth'd his hair, And closed his piteous eyes. . . . Not resting yet, the bright god wander'd soon Down by the torrent's track; And lo! a sudden glory hid the moon, And dawn rose at his back. II. Dawn purple on the peaks, and pouring in floods Into the valleys fair, Encrimsoning the lakes and streams and woods, Illuming heaven and air. And every creature gladden'd, and the Earth Turn'd on her side and woke: There came sweet music; sunny gleams of mirth Across the landscape broke. And when a thousand eyes of happy things Had open'd all around, And when each form that blooms, each form that sings, Saw Balder glory-crown'd, Standing like marble bathed in liquid flame, Perfect of face and limb, Infinite voices syllabled his name, And Earth smiled up at him! All shapes that knew him (and all shapes that be Knew Balder's face that hour) Grew glorified—the torrent and the tree, The white cloud and the flower. The meres flash'd golden mirrors for his face; The forests saw and heard; The cataracts brighten'd; in its secret place The sunless runlet stirred. A light of green grass ran before his feet, His brow was bright with dew, Where'er he trod there sprang a flower full sweet, Rose, crimson, yellow, or blue. But Balder's face was pale, altho' his frame Its natal splendour wore; Altho' the green Earth gladden'd as he came, God Balder's soul was sore. ‘O happy Earth! O happy beams of day! O gentle things of breath! Blest were ye, if some hand divine might slay The slayer, even Death!’ He spake, and he was answer'd. By his side A crimson river ran, Out of the cloven mountains spreading wide It water'd vales for man. Amid its shallows flowers and sedge did twine, But in the midst 'twas deep, And on its sides fed flocks of goats and kine O'er meadows soft as sleep. Suddenly, while upon its marge he stood, His heart grew cold as clay,— For lo! the phantom! sailing down the flood, Dim in the dawn of day! . . . 'Mid drifted foxglove-bells and leaves of green Uptorn and floating light, There came, with face upturn'd, now hid, now seen, A maiden dark as night— Her raven hair was loosen'd, her soft breath Had fled and left no stir, Her eyes were open, looking up at Death, Who drifted down with her. Beside her, tangled 'mid the foxglove-bells, A shepherd's crook was cast, While softly on the waters silvern swells Her form was floating past. And lo! with eyes of feverish fatal light Fix'd on her face in dream, Death clung unto her 'mid the eddies bright Upon the shining stream. And Balder wail'd; and wafted down that way, Death saw his shape and knew,— Then, like a falcon startled from its prey, Rose, vanishing from view! III. The Fight of Ships. Now Balder came across the great sea-shore, And saw far out upon the windless waves A fight of water-dragons fierce as fire, Wingëd and wild and wrought about with gold. And dragon unto dragon clash'd and clung, And each shriek'd loud, and teeth in teeth were set, Until the sea was crimson'd, and one sank In its own blood. So like to living things They seem'd, but ships they were within whose wombs Throbbed many savage hearts. And suddenly, Amid that clangour of sharp steel and shriek Of living voices, 'mid the thick o' the fight, When in the stainëd waters all around Men to the brain were cloven as they swam, Balder saw dimly, hovering on wings, Ev'n as the kestrel hovers poised and still With glittering eyes searching the nether ground, The Shape he sought. As the bright dragons rush'd This way and that with rapid sweep of oars, And as the tumult passed from wave to wave, It follow'd, as the falcon followeth Some fearful quarry creeping on the ground. And when the sunset came, and the great din Was hush'd, and torn apart from one another The dragons darken'd on a fiery sea, The Shape, illumined with a crimson gleam, Still linger'd o'er them very quietly, Scenting the slain that drifted like to weeds On the red waters, shoreward. Then aloud Cried Balder, ‘Father!’ uttering from his heart A bitter moan, and as he spake he saw, All congregating on the brazen walls Of sunset, with their wild eyes looking down, Feeding upon the carnage of the fight, The gods his kin; and like to evening clouds, Crimson and golden in the sunset flame, They would perchance have seem'd to human eyes, But his perceived them clearly and discern'd The rapture in their faces as they gazed. Yet ne'ertheless he cried, ‘Come down, ye gods, And help me, that upon this fatal thing I lay my hand!’ They laugh'd reply, and lo! He saw their banners raised i' the wind, their brands Flashing and moving. ‘Father!’ No reply; But quiet as a curtain fell the night, Solemn, without a star. Then by the sea Silent walk'd Balder, and all sounds were still Beyond him on the bosom of the deep. And where he went along the moonless sands He made a brightness such as ocean shells Keep in their iris'd ears; and the soft sea Came singing round his silvern feet; and doves Came out of caves and lit upon his hands. Then Balder thought, ‘He answer'd, and has sent The darkness as a token!’ and ev'n then He blest his father. . . . What is this that flames, Lurid and awful, out upon the sea? What dusky radiance, tho' the world is dark, Shoots like a comet yonder upon the sky? Seized in the fangs of fire, a dragon-ship Consumes and shrieks, and as it burns illumes The water under and the thunderous rack Blackening above; and Balder as he stands Pallid upon a headland, on his face Catches the red reflection of the ray; Ocean and sky are crimson'd, and he sees Black shapes that hither and thither, waving arms, Dart 'midst the flame on the consuming decks And plunge with shrill scream down into the sea. What care to call on the Immortals now? He looks, one hand prest hard in agony Upon his aching heart, and he discerns, Brooding above that brightness, poised i' the air, Down gazing, half illumed, half lost in light, The Phantom! As the ship consumes and fades, And as the last cry rises on the air, The Shape sinks lower with no waft of wing. And when in dumb and passionate despair, Balder looks northward once again, he sees The cloud-rack parted, the cold north on fire, And all the gods, with cruel cheeks aflame And bright eyes glittering like cluster'd stars, Thronging against the blacken'd bars of Heaven. IV. Ydun. Then Balder lifted up his voice and cried, ‘Curst be this thing and you who sent it hither, Tho' ye be gods, immortal, and my kin; For now I loathe you, deeming lovelier far The black hawk, and the fox upon the ground, Who slay sweet lives not knowing what they do; But ye, O gods, are wise, yet Death's sick scent Is pleasant to your nostrils.’ Loudly afar A laugh of thunder answer'd, and the shapes Still congregated in the glistening north Flash'd like the pale aurora one white gleam Of earthward-looking eyes, and in the midst A hoary Face like to a moonlit cloud, Silent, and staring down with orbs of stone. And on this last did Balder gaze, and lo! He shiver'd cold, his cheek divine was blanch'd, And with no further word he turn'd away. . . . So walk'd he by the Ocean, till that gleam Far out upon the crimson waters died; Till night grew deeper and all sounds were still'd. And all that night his human heart was turn'd Against the gods his kin, against the god His father; for he thought, ‘He made this thing, He sent it hither to the happy Earth; And when it slays they gladden in the halls Of Asgard, and no pity fills their hearts For gentle stricken men.’ Long hours he paced The cold sands of the still black sea; and where His foot fell moonlight lay and live seasnails Crept glimmering with pink horns; and close to shore He saw the legions of the herring flash, Swift, phosphorescent, on the surface shining Like bright sheet-lightning as they came and went. At intervals, from the abyss beyond, Came the deep roar of whales. Betimes he stood Silent, alone, upon a promontory And now about him like white rain there fell The splendour of the moonlight. All around The calm sea rolled upon the rocks or drew Dark surges from the caverns, issuing thence Troubled and churn'd to boiling pools of foam. Erect he stood, uplifting his white hands; For round him on the slippery weed-hung reefs, Outcreeping from the blackness of the sea, In legions came the flocks of gentle seals And gray sea lions with their lionesses. And o'er the rocks they clomb till all the place Was blacken'd, and the rest upon the sea, Their liquid eyeballs in the moonlight burning, Swam round and round with necks outstretch'd to gaze; And those beneath him touch'd his shining feet, And when he raised his hand and blest them all, Uplifted heads like happy flocks of sheep Bleating their joy! Ev'n then he heard a voice Cry ‘Balder!’ thrice, and turning he beheld Standing above him on the promontory A spirit he remember'd; for her hair Swept downward like the silvern willow's leaves, And on her mystic raiment blue as heaven There glimmer'd dewy drops like heavenly stars. And as he turn'd unto her he perceived Her deathlike pallor, and he straightway knew He look'd on Ydun, who had given to him Those mystic apples which immortal forms For ever feed on evermore renew'd. And Ydun said, ‘O Balder, I could hear Thy lone cry yonder in the silent realms Where, gathering golden asphodels in meads Of starlight under the dark Tree, I stray'd; And all my heart was troubled for thy sake, My brother, and I came across the worlds To seek thee, bringing in my veilëd breast More fruits to heal thee and to make thee strong Despite the gods who love thee not, thy kin; For I who bring them love thee, knowing well There stands no shape in the celestial halls So beautiful as thou!’ And as she spake She drew the apples forth and proffer'd them To Balder's lips; but on those lips there lay An ashen tinge as of mortality. And taking not the gift he answer'd low, ‘O Ydun, let me give thy gift to men, That they may eat and live!’ But Ydun said, While on his cheek he felt her breath come cold As frosty moonlight,—‘Name them not, but eat— Eat thou, and live. O Balder, men were born To gather earthly fruit a little space, And then, grown old with sudden lapse of years, To wither up and die; and fruit like this Could never light on any human lip The flame-like breath of immortality. Flesh are they, and must fall; spirits are we, And fed with life diviner, we endure.’ Then Balder said, ‘Dost thou not weep for them? Poor mortals with their shadows on the ground, Yet kin to thee and me! He made them fair As we are, tho' they sicken and are slain; Yea, by a god accurst that haunts the world Their hearts are set asunder, and their teeth Devour each other. Lo! the beautiful Earth Is desolate of children, strewn with dead, Sick with a ceaseless moan of stricken things For ever coming and for ever going,— Like wild waves darkly driven on a sea Eternally distress'd.’ Coldly replied The goddess, ‘Take no heed for things of clay,— For 'twere as well to weep for stricken birds, Or flowers that in their season fade and fall, Or beasts that mortals slay for food or cast Upon thy Father's shrines for sacrifice, As mourn for that dark dust beneath thy feet Which thou call'st men. O Balder, take no heed— Be wise—such pity ill beseems a god!’ But Balder wrung his hands and wail'd aloud In a sad human voice, ‘Not pity those? Hath a bird fallen in my sight and fail'd To win some meed of tears? Doth a beast die, I would not wind in my immortal arms, And kiss into a new and lovelier life? And on the dead leaves shed i' the weary woods Do I not strew my tears divine, like dew? O Ydun, listen, for thou know'st me not. The taint of clay is on me and I lack The large cold marble heart befitting gods. I drank strange mercy from the dark Earth's breast When she my foster-mother suckled me Close to her leafy heart; I am not wise, Ay me, I am not wise, if not to love The happy forms below me, and the faces That love my voice—and gladden in my smile, Be wisdom; I am of them; I have learn'd The pathos of the setting sun, the awe Of moonlight and of starlight; nay, I dream That shape which sets its icy hand on all Will find me in my season like the rest. They are my brethren, wanderers in the world, Yet fatherless and outcast like myself, And exiled from their home!’ But Ydun said, ‘That shape which sets its icy hand on all Need never trouble thee, if thou wilt eat, Eat as I bid, and live;—nay, Death himself, Tame as a hound some little child may lead, Hath fed from out my hand and from my fruits Drank immortality; and lo, he walks Immortal among mortals, on Earth's ways Shedding the sad leaves of humanity. For this is written, they must die; and those Who die in battle or with bloody hands The gods redeem and snatch to deathless days Of terror in Valhalla; but the rest, Weak maiden-hearted men and women pale, And children, dying bloodless, find below A nameless and an everlasting sleep.’ ‘O Ydun,’ Balder cried, ‘I have search'd the Earth, And have not found him, tho' my spirit pants To look into his face and question him, That Death of whom you speak, that fantasy, Immortal, and a god; but evermore His form eludes me in the light and dark, And evermore beneath my feet I find Only some gentle shape that he hath slain.’ Then Ydun smiled as pallid starlight smiles On marble, and she answer'd, ‘Eat, then eat! And by the gods of Asgard I will swear To lead thee to him and to read a rune Which whisper'd in his ear shall make him meek And weak as any lamb to do thy will;’ And as she spake she held the apples forth And proffer'd them again to Balder's lips. Then hungry for her promise Balder ate, And in his mouth the mingled red and white Melted as snow, and suddenly he seem'd Grown into perfect glory like the moon Springing all silvern from a summer cloud. VI. BALDER AND DEATH. I. The Altar of Sacrifice. ‘Look!’ Ydun said; and pointed. Far in the night She had led Balder,—o'er the darken'd dales, And by the silence of black mountain tarns, And thro' the slumber of primæval woods,— Till she had come unto an open plain Cover'd with ragged heath and strewn with stones As with the broken fragments of some world Upheaven, rent by earthquake. And the waste All round was lonely and illimitable, A tract of stone and heath without a tree, Save where against the blood-red northern sky A mountain like the great white hand of Earth Pointed at highest heaven. Far out beyond The shadow of the snowy mountain, rose Columns gigantic of red granite rock Scarr'd with the tempest, hung with slimy moss, And looming in the cold and spectral light Like living shapes of gods; and some by storm Were cast upon the ground and lay full length Like giants slain, but most stood poised on end, Not tottering, with their shadows wildly cast Southward, along the sward. High in the midst Stones fashion'd as an altar were upraised, And on the altar was a coffin'd space Wherein a man full-grown might lie his length And with his pleading eyes upon the stars Make ready for the sacrificial knife. ‘Look!’ Ydun said; and Balder look'd; and saw, Crouching upon the altar, one that loom'd Like to a living shape. And Ydun said, ‘That is thy Father's altar, and thereon Blood-offering brighter than the life of lambs Is scatter'd by his priests; at sunset here A virgin died, and all the desert air Is sweeter for her breath; and those black birds That hover o'er the altar moaning low Are hungry to come near her and to feed,— But he who lieth yonder hath not fed His own immortal hunger. There he broods Still as a star above her, with one hand Placed on her lifeless breast!’ Then Balder felt His godhead shrink within him like a flame A cold wind bloweth, and for pity's sake His eyes divine were dim; but, creeping close, Within the shadow of a shatter'd column, He gazed and gazed. And lo, the sight he saw Was full of sorrow only eyes divine Could see and bear. Upon the altar-stone Lay stretchëd naked and most marble white That gentle virgin, with the slayer's mark Across her throat, her red mouth open wide, And two great sightless orbs upraised to heaven, And he who clung unto her, like a hawk With wings outstretch'd, and dim dilated eyes Feeding upon the sorrow of her face, Was he whom Balder o'er the world had sought And had not found. Ne'er yet, by sea or shore, Not ev'n within the silence of the woods When his sad eyes beheld him first of old, Had Balder to that spirit terrible E'er crept so nigh or seen its shape so well. Shadow it seem'd, and yet corporeal, But thro' the filmy substance of its frame The blood-red light of midnight penetrated; And dreadfully with dreadful loveliness The features changed their shining lineaments, Now lamb-like, wolf-like now, now like a maid's Scarce blossom'd, now deep-wrinkled like a man's, Now beautiful and awful like a god's,— But never true to each similitude Longer than one quick heart-beat. Thus it hung, So fascinated by the form it watch'd, It saw not, heard not, stirr'd not, though the birds Shriek'd wildly overhead. Ev'n as one cast Into a trance mesmeric, it prolong'd The famine of its gaze until its face Was fixëd as a star. Then Ydun crept Close unto Balder, whispering, ‘Remember That rune I read thee! touch him in his trance, And name him by his mystic human name, And as I live his lips shall answer thee In human speech!’ So speaking, Ydun smiled And vanish'd, leaving Balder all alone To look and watch and wait. . . . . . . Then on his soul, Beholding that great trance of Death, there came Most fatal fascination. For a space He could not stir. Upon the sacred grove Lay darkness; only on the altar stone The naked victim glimmer'd beautiful, And terrible above her linger'd Death;— When suddenly beyond the snow-white peak Rose round and luminous and yellow as gold The full-orb'd moon; by slow degrees its beams Stole down the shrouded mountains, till they fell Prone on the altar, turning all things there To brightness:—so that Death himself was changed From purple into silvern;—that dead maid To silvern too from marble;—the great grove, With all the columns looming black therein, New-lit with lunar dawn. Then as the light Touch'd and illumed him, for a moment Death Stirr'd, ev'n as one that stirreth from a sleep, And trembled, looking upward; and behold! His face grew beautiful thro' golden hair, His eyes dim heavenly blue, and all his looks Strange and divinely young! . . . . . . Then, ere that trance Was wholly shaken from him, Balder rose, And crept unto the altar with no sound; And ere the shape could stir or utter cry, He clutch'd him with one quick and eager hand; And tho' his hand was frozen as it touch'd, Ere Death could fly he gazed into his eyes And named him by his mystic human name. . . . And Death gazed back with looks so terrible, They would have wither'd any living man; But Balder only smiled and wove his rune,— And in a little space the shape was charm'd, Looking and listening in a nameless fear. II. Balder and Death. ‘O Death, pale Death, thro’ many a lonely land My feet have follow'd thee; Sisters and brothers stricken by thy hand Oft have I stoop'd to see: ‘To kiss the little children on their biers So innocent and sweet, To bless the old men wearied out with years Wrapt in thy winding-sheet. ‘To look into thine eyes, to drink thy breath, I have cried with a weary cry: Prayers I have said to the great gods, O Death, While thou hast darken'd by. ‘Thy mark is on the flower and on the tree, And on the beast and the bird, Thy shade is on the mountains, even the sea By thy sad foot is stirred. ‘Slayer thou art of all my soul deems fair, Thou saddenest the sun,— Of all things on the earth and in the air, O Death, thou sparest none. ‘And therefore have I sought with prayers and sighs To speak with thee a space!’ Bright Balder in the hollow rayless eyes Look'd with a fearless face. The phantom darken'd 'neath the clay cold moon And seem'd to shrink in woe, But Balder named his name and wove the rune, And would not let him go. ‘O Death! pale Death! thou hast a lovelier name, Who gave that name to thee? By the high gods, by that from which they came, Thy mouth must answer me!’ Death answer'd not, but mystically bright, His shadowy features grew, And on his brow the chilly lamps of night Sprinkled their glistening dew, And Balder wonder'd, for those lights above Seem'd shining down on him, And death's pale face grew as the face of Love, Yet more divinely dim. ‘O Death, pale Death! Who gave thee that sweet name, Yet sent thee down to slay poor things of breath, And turn men's hearts to flame? ‘Who gave thee life and cast thy lot below With those sad slaying eyes?’ Death pointed with a hand as white as snow Up to the moonlit skies. ‘Who sent thee here where men and beasts have birth?’ Death trembled and was still. ‘What drew thee down on my beloved Earth, To wither up and kill?’ Death answer'd not, but pointed once again Up thro' the starry shine; And Balder question'd with a quick new pain, ‘My kin? the gods divine? Death answer'd not, but gazed on Balder now With strange and questioning gleam— His eyes were soft in sorrow and his brow Was wonderful with dream. ‘Speak to me, brother, if thou art not dumb; Speak to my soul, O Death!’ The thin lips flutter, but no answer hath come, No sigh, no sound, no breath. Yet on the brow of Death there lives a light Like starlight shed on snow, The fatal face grows beautiful and bright With some celestial woe. And round the shadowy cheeks there softly swim Thin threads of silken hair, And Balder sees the form world-worn and dim Hath once been young and fair. And as they sit together in the night, Hand in hand, mingling breath, The fingers white of the cold starry light Smooth the sad hair of Death. III. ‘O Death, pale Death.’ ‘O Death! pale Death! Thy hair is golden, not gray— In the dark mirrors of thine eyes, O Death, Lie glimmering dreams of day. ‘O gentle Death! Thy hand is warm, not chill,— Thy touch is soft and living, and thy breath Sweet, with no power to kill. ‘I love thee, Death, for that great heavenly brow Still dark from love's eclipse— And lo! a hundredfold I hunger now To hear thy living lips. ‘O gentle Death! Speak, that mine ears may hear.’ Then like a fountain rose the voice of Death, Low, sweet, and clear! IV. Death sings. ‘I know not whence my feet have come, Nor whither they must go— Lonely I wander, dark and dumb, In summer and in snow. ‘For on mine eyes there falls a gleam, That keeps them dim and blind, Of strange eternities of dream Before me and behind; And ever, ever as I pace Along my lonely track, The light retires before my face, Advancing at my back; ‘But ever, ever if I turn And would my steps retrace, Close to my back that light doth burn, But flies before my face. ‘I close mine eyes, I fain would sleep, I rest with folded wing, Or on my weary way I creep Like any harmless thing. ‘Yet day by day, from land to land, From gentle fold to fold, I pass, and lo, my cruel hand Leaves all things calm and cold. ‘Man marketh with his bitterest moan My shadow sad and dim; Of all things hateful, I alone Am hatefullest to him! ‘Ay me, a brand is on my brow, A fire is in my breast,— Ever my bitter breath doth bow Those flowers I love the best. ‘I crouch beside the cradled child, I look into its eyes, I love to watch its slumber mild As quietly it lies. ‘I dare not touch it with my hand, Or creep too close to see, Yet for a little space I stand And mark it, silently, ‘Ah, little dream pale human things, At rest beneath the skies, How, as they sleep, with gentle wings I shade their cheeks and eyes! ‘The maiden with her merry laugh, The babe with its faint cry, The old man leaning on his staff, Are mine, and these must die. ‘I touch them softly with my hand, They turn as still as stone, Then looking in their eyes I stand Until their light hath flown. ‘I set faint gleams around their lips, I smooth their brows and hair, I place within their clay-cold grips The lilies of despair. ‘And verily when they bear them forth I follow with the rest; But when their bones are in the earth My gentle task is best. ‘For there I sit with head bent low For many a dreamy day, And watch the grass and flowers grow Out of the changing clay. ‘O think of this and blame not me, Thou with the eyes divine— A Shadow creeps from sea to sea, Stranger than thine or mine. ‘Who made the white bear and the seal? The eagle and the lamb? As these am I—I live and feel— One made me, and I am.’ V. Then Balder lifted up his voice and cried, Placing his fingers on Death's heavenly hair, ‘Lo, I absolve thee!’ and the Spirit crouch'd In silence, looking up with wondering gaze At that immortal brightness blessing him With holy imposition of white hands. For beautiful beyond all dream, and bright Beyond all splendour of the summer Earth, Divine, with aureole around his head, God-like, yet fairer far than any god, Stood Balder, like a thing that could not die! Upon his face the countless eyes of heaven Gazed, with their own exceeding lustre dim; And moonlight hung around him like a veil Through which his glory trembled paramount; And dim sheen showering from a thousand worlds, Mingling with moisture of the nether-air, Touch'd his soft body with baptismal dews. Then far away in the remotest north, Cloud-like and dark and scarce distinguishable, The clustering faces of the gods look'd down. And Balder cried, ‘Lo, I have ranged the Earth, And found it good; yea, hills and vales and streams, Forests and seas, all good and beautiful; And I have gazed in eyes of birds and beasts, And in the gentle orbs of mortal men, And seen in all the light of that dim dream Which grew within my soul when I was born. Only this thing is bitter, O ye gods, Most dark and bitter: that eternal Death Sits by his sad and silent sea of graves, Singing a song that slays the hopes of men. Yet lo, I gaze into the eyes of Death, And they are troubled with that self-same dream. ‘O gods, on you I cry not, but I cry On him, the Father, who has fashion'd Death To be the sorrow of created things, And set this ceaseless hunger in his heart To wither up and kill. Oh, I have wept Till all my heart is weary, and no voice Makes answer. By thy servant Death, O God, By him whom I have sought and found in pain, Listen!—Uplift this shadow from the Earth, And gladly will I die as sacrifice, And all the gentle things I love shall live. Far, far away in the remotest north A white face in the darkness of a cloud Gleam'd. Thither, crouching low at Balder's feet, Death pointed with his skeleton finger fix'd, Silent. Then, even as a snow-white lamb That on the altar cometh with no fear But looks around with eager innocent eyes, God Balder on the stone of sacrifice Leapt, reaching arms up heavenward! . . . And he pray'd. VI. The Last Prayer. ‘Father in heaven, my dream is over, Father in heaven, my day is dark,— I sat in the sun and I sang like a lover Who sings sweet songs for a maid to mark; And the light was golden upon my hair, And the heavens were blue and the Earth was fair, And I knew no touch of a human care, And I bless'd thy name, my Father! I sang, and the clarion winds blew clear, And the lilies rose like lamps on the mere, And all the night in the balmy light I lifted up my hands snow-white, And the stars began to gather! ‘Father, Father, which art in heaven, Lord of men and master of Earth. The rune was woven of colours seven, And out of thy being I had birth; As a snowdrop wakes on the naked ground, And opens its eye without a sound While the winds are murmuring around, I woke on the green Earth's bosom; And I heard a cry, as the storks went by Sailing northward under the sky, And a cry from the mountains answer'd loud, And the cataract leapt like a corpse from its shroud, And the sward began to blossom. ‘White clouds passed over with low sweet thunder, Shaking downward the silvern dew, The soft sods trembled and fell asunder, And the emcrald flame of the grass gleam'd thro', And the fire of the young boughs overhead Ran green and amber, golden and red, And the flashing lamps of the leaves were fed At the torch of the flaming sunshine: Beautiful, wrapt in a blissful dream, Lay mere and mountain, meadow and stream; And beautiful, when the light was low, Creeping white through the after-glow, The starshine and the moonshine! ‘Father, Father, hearken unto me, Then work thy will on the world and me— I walk'd the world, and the glad world knew me, And my feet were kissed by thy slave the Sea. And ever with every happy hour, My love grew deeper for tree and flower, For the beast in the brake, for the bird in the bower, And the deer on the white high places. But ere my golden dream was done, I saw thy Shadow across the sun, I saw thy Shadow that all men see, On beast and bird, on flower and tree, And the flower-sweet human faces! ‘The flower-sweet faces of mortal races Blossoming sadly under the sky! I saw my dream on those fading faces, I heard my voice in their failing cry. Out of the soil and into the sun Their souls were stirring as mine had done, Their dooms were written, their threads were spun, By the hands of the immortals; They rose in a dream and they lookt around, They saw their shadows upon the ground, And wherever they went beneath the blue The darker Shadow thy Spirit threw From the great sun's shining portals. ‘Thou hadst taken clay and hadst made it human, Blown in its nostrils and lent it breath, Thou hadst kindled the beauty of man and woman, To hunt them down with thy bloodhound, Death. They did not crave to be born or be, Yet thou gavest them eyes that their souls might see, And thou hatest them as thou hatest me And the Earth thy godhead bearing. They shrink and tremble before thy hand, They ask and they do not understand, They bid thee pity who pitiest none, And they name thy name, as I, thy Son, Now name it, still despairing. ‘Father, Father, which art in heaven, Why hast thou fashion'd my brethren so? Form'd of fire, with the dust for leaven, As thou hast made them, they come and go. Yet ever thy hand is on their hair To seize and to slay them unaware, And ever their faces are pale with prayer As round thy fanes they gather. . . . Thou askest blood and they give thee life With sweep of the sacrificial knife; Thou seekest praise and they give thee pain, And their altars smoke with the crimson rain Thou lovest, O my Father! ‘Father, Father, 'tis sad to falter Out of the light and into the dark, Like a wreath of smoke from a burning altar To fade and vanish where none may mark. But O my Father, 'tis blest to be A part of the joy of the land and sea, To upleap like a lamb, to be glad and free As the stream of a running river. Could'st thou not spare them a longer space With sweeter meed of a surer grace? Could'st thou not love the light that lies On happy fields and in human eyes, And let it shine for ever? ‘I hear thy voice from the void of heaven, It thunders back and it answers “Nay”— The rune was woven of colours seven For me, thy Son, and for things of clay. Then mark me now as I rise and swear, By the beasts in the brake, by the birds in the air, By Earth, by all those forces fair Which mingled in my making; By men and women who stand supreme Proud and pale with mine own soul's dream, I will drink the cup their lips partake! I will share their lot, while their sad hearts break As mine, thy Son's, is breaking! ‘Father in heaven, my heart is human, I cast a shade like a human thing, Grant me the doom of man and woman; From the Earth I came, to the Earth I cling. Behold who standeth at my side! Even Death, thy servant heavenly eyed— I will die, as the children of men have died, To the sound of his sad singing. Behold, I look in the face of Death, I look in his eyes and I drink his breath; The chill light brightens upon his brow, He creepeth close and he smileth now, His cold arms round me flinging. ‘Father, Father, bend down and hearken, And place thy hand upon my hair; Ere yet I wither, ere yet I darken, Hear me murmur a last low prayer. As the blood of a sacrifice is shed, Let me die in my brethren's stead— Let me die; but when I am dead, Call back thy Death to heaven! Ay me, my Father, if this may be, I will go with a prayer for him and thee, I will pass away without a cry, Blessing and praising thee under the sky, Forgiving and forgiven. ‘. . . . Father, Father, my dream is over— He folds me close, and I cannot see; Yet I shall sleep like a quiet lover If my boon is granted and this may be. O sweet it is if I may rest Asleep on my foster-mother's breast, If over my grave the flowers blow best And happy mortals gather. Yet Father, tho' darkness shrouds my face, Remember me for a little space, Remember, remember, and forgive Thy Son who dies that men may live. . . . Accept me, O my Father!’ VII. The First Snowflake—Falling of the Snow. He ceased; no voice replied; but round his frame Cold arms were woven, and his golden head Droop'd like a lily on the breast of Death. . . . Then suddenly a darkness like a veil Was drawn across the silent void of Heaven, Starlight and moonlight faded mystically, And save for Balder's face, that as a star Still flash'd in pallor on the face of Death, There was no light at all. . . . Then Balder cried, ‘Lo, he hath answer'd; I am thine, O Death; Now let me look into thy loving eyes, And ere I rest, sing low to me again.’ Shivering he spake, and sank upon the ground; But Death stoop'd down above him as he lay, And took the shining head into his lap, And smooth'd with fingers cold the silken hair, And murmur'd Balder's name with singing lips Soft as the whisper of a wind in June. ‘O Death, white Death, all is so cold and dark, I cannot see the shining of thy face!’ Then touching Balder's lips, Death answer'd low, ‘Thy day is ended—thou wilt see no more— Sleep, sleep!’ . . . . . . But what is this that wavers slowly Out of that purple blackness overhead? Is it a blossom from the silvern boughs O'ershadowing the azure pools of heaven? Or feather from the plume of some sweet star That ever moveth magically on From mansion unto mansion of the sky? Soft as a bloom from the white hawthorn spray It wavers earthward thro' the starless dark, Unseen, unfelt, until it gains the light Which Balder breathes around him as he lies. There, as a white moth hovers in the moon, It floats and gleams, then sinking softly down, Falls as a seal on Balder's shining brow And melts away. ‘. . . O Death, upon mine eyes, And on my brow, I feel a touch like dew, Like cold dew shaken from a morning cloud. Look heavenward—seest thou aught of the great gods, Or God my Father?’ But the form replied, ‘On heaven and in the air 'tis night, deep night; No shape is seen, no star, nor any light. Sleep, Balder, sleep!’ Then bending low he kissed The lips of Balder, yea with kisses calm He drew sweet Balder's breath, and lo! he shone Brighter and brighter with the life he drank. But Balder darken'd ever and grew cold. ‘O Death, I feel thee smiling in a dream Serene and still and very beautiful— But ah, thy lips are chill!’ and Death moan'd low, Winding his thin arms tight round Balder's frame, ‘Sleep, sleep!’ . . . O what are these that waver slowly Out of the purple blackness overhead? Soft as that first white blossom blown from heaven, Faltering downward thro' the rayless dark, They come, they gather, falling flake on flake With silvern lapse and silent interchange, Hovering in soft descent as if they lived. Upon the drooping head of Death they fall Like lightly shaken leaves, and looking up He sees the black air troubled into life Of multitudinous waifs that wander down. There is no sound—only the solemn hush Of mystic motions and invisible wings; There is no lamp, no star; but lo! the air Is glimmering dimly with the faint wan light Shed from the blossoms as they melt and fade. ‘Under green boughs, under green boughs, O Death, Thou hast borne me, and I see not, but I hear The tremor of the soft trees overhead, A sound like fountains flowing, and a touch Like cool leaves shaken on mine eyes and hair!’ And Balder stirred his gentle head and smiled— Then drew one last long breath, and sank to sleep. 'Tis over now—the gods may gaze in peace— Balder is dead! Ay me, the light hath passed From that once glorious head: still as a stone It lies, not shining, in the lap of Death; The hair is white, the eyes are glazed and dim, There is no red upon the loving lips, And in its cage the singing heart lies cold. Ah, Death, pale Death, thy kisses come in vain. Close thou his lids, and by his side stretch down The cold white marble arms, and at his head Watch like a mourner, for a little space. Death sits and gazes on; but lo, his looks Are pale as Balder's. . . . All the light he wore Hath faded, and his orbs are rayless now. Lifeless he looms in vigil while his eyes Turn upward and his thin cold hand still lies Ev'n as a frozen stone on Balder's heart. Thicker and thicker from the folds of heaven The floating blooms are shaken; lo, the waste Is with a glittering whiteness carpeted,— While still o'erhead in ever-gathering clouds, Drifting from out the vapours of the dark, The white flakes fall. O wonder of the snow! The world's round ball is wrapt in crystal now, And out of heaven there comes a freezing breath; And nothing stirs or lives; and in his shroud Woven by frost's swift fingers, Balder lies, And that fair face which made creation glad Is fixëd as a rayless mask of ice. Crouch at his head, O Death! and hour by hour Watch the still flakes of heaven wavering down, Till thou, and that which lieth at thy feet, And all the world, are clad in wondrous white! VII. THE COMING OF THE OTHER. I. How long he lay in that strange trance of night Might Balder never know; Silently fell the waifs of stainless white, And deeper grew the snow. While out of heaven the falling flakes were shed, The dark hours grew to days; And round and round a red moon overhead Went circling without rays. Therewere no stars, only that cheerless thing Treading the wintry round; There was no light, save snow-flowers glimmering Without a sound. Darkness of doom is shed on Balder's eyes, But whiteness shrouds the wold; And still at Balder's head the phantom lies Silent and calm and cold. And chill is Balder as some naked man Made marble by the frost: His veins are ice; upon his bosom wan His two thin hands are crost. But as within some clammy wall of stone The death-watch keeps its chime,— The cold heart in that crouching skeleton Ticks out the time. All round, a world of snow, and snows that fall, Flake upon flake, so white; An empty heaven fluttering like a pall, Lit by that one red light. All round, the solemn slumber of the snow, No sigh, no stir, no breath,— But in the midst, scarce audible, slow, low, The throbbing pulse of Death. . . . The hours creep on, the dreary days are shed, Measured by that slow beat; And all the while god Balder lieth dead, Wrapt in his winding-sheet. II. The Light on the Snow. O Death, Death, press thy hand so lean and bare Upon thy beating heart! O Death, raise up thy head and scent the air With nostrils cold apart! Awaken from thy trance, O Death, and rise, And hearken with thine ears! . . . Death stirs, and like a snake with glistening eyes His luminous head uprears. . . . Awaken! listen! Far across the night, And down the drifts of snow, There stirs a lonely light,—a blood-red light That moveth to and fro. Sniall as a drop of dew, most dim to sight, It glimmereth afar. . . . O Death, it cometh hither,—growing bright And luminous as a star. O Death, pale Death, What do thine eyes behold? What lonely star flasheth afar Across the wintry wold? The world is folded in its shroud of white; The skies are smother'd deep; There is no lamp at all in heaven, to light Death Balder's sleep. There is no lamp at Balder's head, no star Outlooking from the cloud; White is the snow-drift woven near and far, And white is Balder's shroud. O death, pale Death, across the lone white land No heavenly rays are shed,— Yet still thou-gazest, clutching Balder's hand, At yonder gleam blood-red. . . . It crawleth as a snail along the ground, Still far and faint to see, O Death, it creepeth surely, with no sound, Across the night, to thee. O gentle Death, Why dost thou crouch so low? A star it seems, a star that travelleth From snow to snow. Nearer it cometh, and across the night Its beams fall crimson red, The drifts beneath it glimmer and grow bright Like cheeks lamp-lit and dead. O gentle Death, Hither it cometh slow;— A Shadow creepeth with the same, O Death From snow to snow. III. The Face and the Voice. Nearer and nearer o'er the waste of white It steals, and doth not fade: A light, and in the glimmer of the light A form that casts a shade. Nearer and nearer, till Death's eyes behold A semblance strange and gray, A silent shape that stoopeth and doth hold The lamp to light its way. Bent is he as a weary snow-clad bough, Gaunt as a leafless tree, But glamour of moonlight lies upon his brow, Most strange to see! And in one hand a silvern lanthorn swings Fill'd with a crimson light, And round his frame wind-blown and shivering clings A robe of starry white. . . . O Death, pale Death, Well may thy cold heart beat! The form that comes hath piercëd hands, O Death, And bloody piercëd feet. Slowly he crawleth under the cold skies, His limbs trail heavy as lead, Pale fixëd blue his eyes are, like the eyes Of one that sleeps stone-dead. Ay me, for never thro' so wan a wold Walk'd one so sadly fair— The wild snows drift, the wind blows shrill and cold, And those soft feet are bare. . . . O who is this that walketh the wintry night, With naked hands and feet! O who is this that beareth a blood-red light, And weareth a winding-sheet! The night is still, no living thing makes moan; Silent the cold skies loom;— But hark! what voice is this, so faintly blown Across the gloom? ‘Balder! Balder!’ Hush! that cry! The form stands white i' the chilly night, Holding its lamp on high. ‘Balder! Balder! Where art thou?’ The snow smooths still with fingers chill Dead Balder's brow. O gentle Death, What voice is this that cries? What sad shape stands with lifted hands Alone under the skies? ‘Balder! O Balder! Answer me!’ He stands and softly sighs, And vacant are his eyes As if they cannot see! Yet in the weary gloom full faint they glow, And fix themselves at last— He sees dead Balder sleeping in the snow, And thither he fleeteth fast! He comes now swifter than a bark Which bitter tempests blow,— Dreadful he flashes down the dark, With black prints on the snow! ‘Wake, Balder! wake!’ His voice calls now— The shrill cry circles like a snake Round Balder's brow! Oh, who is this that walketh the wintry night With naked hands and feet? O who is this that beareth a blood-red light And weareth a winding-sheet? There is a gleam upon his brow and hair Ev'n as of luminous hands, Swiftly he comes to Balder's side, and there He stands! And Death crawls moaning from his snowy seat To grasp his raiment hem, And toucheth with his mouth the piercëd feet, Yea, softly kisseth them. O Death! pale Death! He gazeth down on thee— His smile is like no smile of thing of breath, Yet is it sweet to see. He lifts the lamp—and lo! its red rays glance On Balder's sleeping eyes— ‘Balder! O Balder! from thy trance Arise!’ . . . . Strange flash'd the wondrous ray Aslant the silent snows; Death wail'd—and slowly, gaunt and gray, Dead Balder rose! IV. ‘Wake, Balder! Wake!’ Silent rose Balder, ev'n as one Who wakens from a swoon, Turning his head from side to side In the red wintry moon. Wrapt in his winding-sheet of snow He loom'd in the dim light, And marble-pale his cold cheeks gleam'd Under his locks of white. ‘Wake, Balder! wake!’ the strange voice cried; Dead Balder woke and heard, And turn'd his face to his who spake, Shiv'ring, but said no word. ‘Wake, Balder! wake!’ the strange voice cried; And Balder woke and knew,— And lo! upon his lips and hair A golden glimmer grew! O who art thou with blessed voice, Who biddest my heart beat? And wherefore hast thou waken'd me From sleep so heavenly sweet?’ Then answer'd back that tall still form, In a clear voice and low, Stretching his arms and brightening, White-robed, and pale as snow. ‘I am thine elder Brother Come from beyond the sea; For many a weary night and day I have been seeking thee!’ Oh, Balder's cheeks are shining bright, And smiles are on his face— ‘I dream'd, and saw one with a lamp Passing from place to place. ‘And ever, as he wander'd on, Softly he cried to me— Art thou mine elder Brother? Then shall my lips kiss thee!’ ‘I am thine elder Brother, Come from beyond the sea; Balder, my brother Balder, Kiss thou me!’ Death moans, and crouching on the snow Uplooketh with eyes dim, For Balder on his brother's breast Hath fallen, kissing him. ‘Thou art mine elder Brother, The risen Balder cries; ‘I know thee by thy gentle voice And by thy tearful eyes. ‘Thou art mine elder Brother, Most heavenly sad and sweet, Yet wherefore hast thou piercëd hands And naked piercëd feet? ‘O wherefore are thy cheeks so chill, Thy lips so cold and blue, And wherefore com'st thou in thy shroud, As if arisen too?’ The white Christ smiled in Balder's face, But softly his tears ran— ‘Like thee I lived, like thee I loved, And died, like thee, for Man.’ V. The Birth and Death. The white Christ cried, and on the air His voice like music rang, And Balder listen'd silently As if an angel sang. ‘Out of the dark Earth was I born, Under the shining blue, And to a human height I rose, And drank the light, and grew. ‘The land was beauteous where I dwelt, A still and silent land, Where little pools of heaven fall And gleam 'mid wastes of sand. ‘I loved the bright beasts of the earth, And birds both great and small; I loved all God made beautiful, But mortals most of all. ‘For on their faces framed of clay, And in their eyes divine, I saw the shadow of the dream Which nightly sadden'd mine. ‘But when I knew their days were dark, And all their spirits sore, Because of this same silent Death Creeping from door to door, ‘I raised my hands to heaven and cried On him that fashion'd me, My Father dear who dwells in heaven, And suffers Death to be. ‘And sweet and low this answer came Out of the quiet sky— All that is beautiful shall abide, All that is base shall die! ‘Take thou thy cross and bear it well, And seek my servant Death: Thou too shalt wither like a flower Before his bitterest breath. ‘Yea, thou shalt slumber in his arms Three nights and days, and then, With that cold kiss upon thy lips, Awaken once again! ‘And when thou wakenest at last Thy work is yet undone, For thou shalt roam the Earth, and seek Thy Brethren one by one! ‘Yea, one by one unto thy heart Thy kin shall gather'd be, Each pallid from the kiss of Death And beautiful like thee!’ ‘O Balder, when my dark day came, And in despair I died, The same sad Death sang low to me, Who croucheth at thy side! ‘And all my living breath was gone For three long nights and days, And by my side the phantom knelt Like one that waits and prays. ‘But when my Father's voice again Came faint and low to me, I rose out of my grave, and saw Earth sleeping silently. ‘He who had hush'd me in his arms Was busy other-where. . . . I stood and watch'd my Father's eyes Shine down thro' azure air. ‘Then softly, with a happy smile, Along the land I crept, And found the men that I had loved, Who waited, lived, and wept. ‘And lo, I blessed them one and all, And cried with a human cry, “All that is beautiful shall abide, All that is base shall die.” ‘But when my loving task was done, My soul took better cheer, And wandering thro' the world unseen I sought my Brethren dear. ‘All in my robe of snowy white From realm to realm I trod, Seeking my Brethren who had died, The golden Sons of God!’ VI. The Paracletes. ‘I wander'd east, thro' shining realms Of bright and brazen day, And there, by a great river's side, I saw a Brother pray. ‘For past his feet the corpses drave Along the yellow tide, Chased by the emerald water-snakes And vultures crimson-eyed. ‘And from the banks there rose a wail Of women for their dead; They wept and tore their linen robes, And plunged 'neath wheels of dread. ‘Upon his brow he wore a crown, But his black feet were bare, And in his bright and brooding eyes There dwelt a piteous care. ‘From his red lips there came a sound Like music of a psalm, And those who listen'd ceased their tears And grew divinely calm. ‘On his own grave he sat and smiled, A spirit dark and sweet, And there were flowers upon his head And fruits around his feet. . . . ‘I wander'd west where eagles soar Far o'er the realms of rains, And there, among pale mountain peaks, One hung in iron chains. ‘His head was hoary as the snow Of that serene cold clime, Yet like a child he smiled, and sang The cradle song of Time. ‘And as he sang upon his cross, And in no human tones, The cruel gods who placed him there Were shaken on their thrones. ‘I kiss'd him softly on the lips, And sighing set him free— He wanders now in the green world, Divine, like thee and me. . . . ‘Then faring on with foot of fire I cross'd the windy main. And reach'd a mighty continent Wash'd green with dew and rain. ‘There swift as lightning in the sun Ran beauteous flocks and herds, And there were forests flashing bright, And many-colour'd birds. ‘And there the red-skin'd hunters chased The deer and wild black kine,— And lo! another gentle god Was sitting in a shrine! ‘His skin enwrought, as if he lived, With mystic signs, sat he; Shaven his forehead, and his face Was painted terribly. ‘Yet was he gentle as the dew, And gracious as the rain: With healing gifts he made men glad Upon that mighty plain. . . . ‘I wander'd south, where rivers roll'd Yellow with slime and sand, And, black against an orange sky, I saw another stand. ‘Two cymbals held he as he stood, And clash'd them with shrill wail: The clash was as the thunder's voice, Heard 'mid the drifting gale. ‘Black was his skin as blackest night, Naked as night each limb, Yet in his eyeballs, on his cheeks, The heavenly dew did swim. . . . ‘O Balder, these thy Brethren were Surely as they were mine. I wander north, and thee I find The best and most divine! ‘Yea, each of these was offer'd up As thou hast been, and I; Their blood was drifted ev'n as smoke Up to the silent sky. ‘All these loved Man and the green Earth As thou hast done, and I; And each of these by stronger gods Was smitten down to die. ‘Yet ever when I came, and spake The word and made the sign, Their souls grew clothed in gentleness And rose again with mine! ‘Yea, for the love of living men They stood renew'd in breath, And smote the great gods from their thrones With looks made strong thro' Death. ‘With faces fair they rose and wrought Against the gods with me, To make the green Earth beautiful From shining sea to sea. ‘Yea, Balder, these thy Brethren were, Surely as they were mine: My Father's blessing on thy lips, For thou, too, art divine!’ VII. Beneath his feet the pale Death crouch'd Ev'n as a lean white bear, Watching with dark and dreamful eyes That face so strangely fair. But paler, sadder, wearier, Stood Balder in his shroud, While overhead a star's still hand Parted the drifting cloud; And from the lattices of heaven The star look'd down on him; But Balder saw not, and his eyes With tearful dews were dim, ‘O Brother, on my sense still lies The burthen of my sleep, A weight is on me like the weight Of winter on the Deep. ‘For I remember as I wake Mine old glad life of dream— The vision of the bridal Earth, The glory and the gleam! ‘Oh, beautiful was the bright Earth, And round her purple bed The torches of great rivers burnt Amber and blue and red! ‘And beautiful were living men, Wandering to and fro, With sun and moon and stars for lights, And flowers and leaves below. ‘But evermore this phantom Death Was darkening the sun, Seeking the sweetest to destroy. Sparing and pitying none. ‘And lo, I live, and at my feet Death cold and silent lies,— While in thine own dear Father's name Thou biddest me arise. ‘O wherefore should I rise at all Since all is black above, And trampled 'neath the feet of gods Lie all the shapes I love? ‘Ay me, the dead are strewn with snows, They sleep and cannot see, With no soft voice to waken them As thine has waken'd me! ‘And wherefore should my soul forget What cruel kin were mine, Tho' in another Father's name Thou greetest me divine?’ The white Christ gazed in Balder's face, And held his hand, and cried, ‘Divine thou art and beautiful, And therefore must abide! ‘And in mine own dear Father's name I greet and bid thee rise, And we shall stand before his throne And look into his eyes.’ But Balder moan'd, ‘Who made the Earth, And all things foul or fair? Who made the white bear on the berg, The eagle in the air? ‘Who made the lightning's forkëd flame, Who thunder's blacken'd brand? Who fashion'd Death, with fatal eyes, Chill breath, and clammy hand?’ Death stirred and clung to Bilder's feet And utter'd forth a cry— A thousand starry hands drew back The curtains of the sky! And countless eyes look'd calmly down Thro' azure clear and cold, And lo! the round red moon became A shining lily of gold! Then on the wilderness of snow A lustrous sheen was shed, And splendour as of starlight grew Around the white Christ's head. And Christ cried, gazing down on Death, Making a mystic sign, ‘Now blessings on my servant Death, For he too is divine. ‘O Balder, he who fashion'd us, And bade us live and move, Shall weave for Death's sad heavenly hair Immortal flowers of love. ‘Ah! never fail'd my servant Death, Whene'er I named his name,— But at my bidding he hath flown As swift as frost or flame. ‘Yea, as a sleuth-hound tracks a man, And finds his form, and springs, So hath he hunted down the gods As well as human things! ‘Yet only thro' the strength of Death A god shall fall or rise— A thousand lie on the cold snows, Stone still, with marble eyes. ‘But whosoe'er shall conquer Death, Tho' mortal man he be, Shall in his season rise again, And live, with thee, and me! ‘And whosoe'er loves mortals most Shall conquer Death the best, Yea, whosoe'er grows beautiful Shall grow divinely blest.’ The white Christ raised his shining face To that still bright'ning sky. ‘Only the beautiful shall abide, Only the base shall die!’ VIII. But Balder moan'd, ‘O beauteous Earth Now lying cold and dead, Bright flash'd the lamps of flowers and stars Around thy golden head! ‘And beautiful were beast and bird, And lamb and speckled snake, And beautiful were human things Who gladden'd for my sake. ‘But lo! on one and all of those Blew the cold blighting breath, Until I died that they might live And bought their life with death. ‘Behold, I live, and all is dark, And wasted is my pain, For glimmering at my feet I see The fatal eyes again. ‘Why stays he here upon the Earth? Why lingers he below? The empty heavens wait for him,— 'Tis ended—let him go!’ Death look'd up with a loving face, And smiled from the white ground;— The stars that sat upon their thrones Seem'd singing with low sound. The white Christ cried, ‘The green Earth lives! She sleeps, but hath not died! She and all fair things thou hast named Shall quicken and abide! ‘O Balder, those great gods to whom Thy radiant life was given, Were far too frail to keep their plight And summon Death to heaven. ‘There is no god of all thy kin Dare name that name aloud: When his cold hand was on thy heart, Each crouch'd within his cloud. ‘Thou couldst not buy the boon of those, They were too weak and poor; Fain would they buy a boon of thee, Now thy strange sleep is o'er! ‘Yet now for evermore fulfilled Is thine ancestral rune, For thou indeed hast conquer'd Death And won thy gentle boon. ‘Yea, thou hast died as fair things die In earth, and air, and deep, Yet hast thou risen thrice beautiful Out of thy solemn sleep. ‘For life thrice seal'd and sanctified Is on thy lips and eyes; And whatsoe'er grows fair like thee By love shall also rise. ‘Lo! out of beauty cast away Another beauty grows: What Death reaps in the fields of life In fairer fields he sows. ‘And thro' a thousand gates of gloom, With tracts of life between, The creatures that the Father made Creep on, now hid, now seen; ‘And duly out of every doom A sweeter issue flows, As out of dreary dooms of gods At last thy glory rose! ‘So fairer yet, and ever fair, Thy soul divine shall gleam, A spirit springing from a tomb And rainbow'd into dream! ‘O kiss me, Brother, on the mouth, Yea, kiss me thrice again; For when I feel thy kiss, I feel The sun, and the wind, and the rain! ‘The dead Earth wakens 'neath thy feet, Flame kindles thro' the sod. . . . O kiss me with thy human lips, Thou brightest born of God!’ VIII. THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS. I. ‘Balder! Balder!’ And Balder said, Turning round his gentle head, ‘I hear!’ ‘And thou, my servant Death, Kneeling low with hushëd breath, While my hand is on thy hair!’ Death made answer, kneeling there, ‘I hear!’ ‘At last the cold snows cease, The white world is hush'd in peace, The sky is clear, the storm has gone, Stars are rising to light us on— In the north the moon grows gray,— Take my hand and come away!’ ‘Whither, O Whither?’ ‘To the City strange wherein Dwell the mighty gods thy kin;— O Balder, lead me thither!’ ‘Across the darkness and the day, Long and dreary is the way— O'er chill wastes of misery, Past the silent Frozen Sea, Where the white bears lean and old Run and shiver in the cold— Where the vast ice-mountains rise Violet-blue against the skies, Then across the wondrous Bow Only gods and ghosts may tread,— Beyond the sea, above the snow, Where the sunfire fadeth red; There the night lies and no day— Long and weary is the way— O Brother, fare not thither!’ ‘Broken is the wintry night, Rising yonder is the light; Half our task is yet to do— Come! and thou, Death, follow too— O Balder, lead me thither!’ Far away across the gloom, Rose-red like a rose in bloom, Flashing, changing, ray by ray, Glorious as the ghost of day, Gleam'd in one vast aureole Shifting splendours of the pole. All across the vault of blue Shooting lights and colours flew, And the milky way shone there Like a bosom white and bare, Throbbing, trembling, softly moved By some heart that lived and loved. Night was broken, and grew bright. All the countless lamps of light Swinging, flashing, near and far, Cast their glittering rays below,— While the silvern polar star Throbb'd close down upon the snow. . . . ‘Take my hand, and let us go!’ II. And so those twain have passed across the night, O'er frozen wilds of white, With eyes still fixed upon the polar star That burneth bright afar; And Death behind them, creeping like a hound, Still follows with no sound. O wonders of the cold untravell'd Waste Whereon their swift feet haste! The night is troubled; on the black pole's pyres Flash fierce electric fires, And shadows come and go, phantoms move forth Gigantic in the north. Upon the snow a green light glimmereth, With phosphorescent breath Flashing and fading; and from unseen lairs Creep hoary ghost-like bears, Crawling across their path without a cry. At last against the sky They see the lonely arctic mountains loom, Touch'd with a violet bloom From peak to base and wearing on their heights Strange ever-shifting lights, Yellow and azure and dark amethyst; But westward they are kissed By the bright beams of a great moon of gold. Dead-white and calm and cold Sleeps the great waste, while ever as they go, With shadows on the snow. Their shapes grow luminous and silvern fair, And in the hush'd chill air The stars of heaven cluster with quick breath To gaze on them and Death. Now thro' the trembling sheen of the still sky Blue fires and emerald fly With wan reflections on the sheeted white Outspread beneath the night, And passing thro' them, Christ and Balder seem As spectres in a dream, Until at last their feet come silently To the great arctic sea. Moveless and boundless, stretching blindly forth Into the purple north, Rise mountainous waves and billows frozen all As if i' the act to fall, And tho' they stir not, yet they seem to roll In silence to the pole. So, lit by countless stars, that Ocean old Wrapt in the vapours cold Of its own breath, beneath the lamps of night Gleams blue and shadowy white! Then Balder crieth,—and around his brow New glory glimmereth now,— ‘Ay me, remote from men are the abodes Of the immortal gods; Beyond the ocean of the ice; afar Under the sleepless star; And o'er the flood of the wild waters spanned. From lonely land to land, By the great bridge of the eternal Bow.’ The white Christ answereth low, ‘Tho' it were further than the furthest light That glimmereth this night, Thither our souls are bound, our feet must go!’ III. The Bridge of Ghosts. Their feet have passed the frozen Deep Whose waves in silence roll, And now they reach that ocean black Which beats the inmost pole. Before them, on the northern sky Rose-red and far withdrawn, Mingled with meteors of the night, Gleam golden dews of dawn; And cast across that liquid sea Which surges black below, They see the pathway of the gods, A many-colour'd Bow. [There comes from off its heights a wind That blows for endless time, As swift as light, as keen as frost, It strikes down souls that climb.] ‘O brother, place thy hand in mine,’ The gentle Balder said; The rayless waters roar'd beneath, The Bridge flash'd overhead. Then hand in hand against the wind They falter'd upward slow, On stairs of crimson and of gold Climbing the wondrous Bow. Like a great rainbow of the earth It rose with faint hues seven, And thro' the purple of the arch Glimmer'd the lights of heaven. When they had reach'd the midmost height, In air they stood so high, To one beneath they would have seem'd As stars upon the sky. The white Christ cried, ‘What lonely light Burns yonder ruby red?’ ‘The mansion of the sun-god Fryer Stands yonder,’ Balder said. ‘There ranged in rows with cold hands crost The slain in silence lie, The face of each ablaze like brass Against the burning sky.’ Far under, as they linger'd there, The dark deep waters roll'd; Beyond, the polar mountains flash'd With gleams of fiery gold. Upon the shores rose hills of ice Hewn as in marble white, Inlaid with opal and with pearl And crown'd with chrysolite. From stair to stair the brethren trod, And Death crawl'd close behind, And ever as they walk'd, the Bridge Shook wavering in the wind. And lo! they seem'd as meteor shapes, White-robed and shod with flame; And to them out of the cold north A threatening murmur came. Down in the sullen sea below Now ghostly faces clomb, Uplooking with wild eyes to theirs And waving hands of foam! So o'er the mighty Bow they moved Snow-vestured and star-crown'd, And Death behind them like a shade Follow'd without a sound. But as they reach'd the shores and stood,— The bright Bridge at their back,— The gods gazed out from the cold north And shriek'd, and all grew black! Deep thunders shook the darken'd heaven, Wild lightning flash'd and fled, The frozen shores of ice and snow Trembled beneath their tread. Round the ice-mountains of the pole Dense smokes of tempest rose, And from their lairs swift whirlwinds leapt Wrapt round with drifting snows. ‘O Brother, hold me by the hand, For lo! the hour is nigh;— I see the shadows of the gods, Yonder upon the sky!’ IV. ‘Behold, I am risen.’ They stood in the snow and they clung together,— The air was blacken'd, the snow was driven; There came a tempest of wintry weather Out of the open gates of heaven. The darkness drifted, the dark snows shifted, The winnowing fans of the winds were lifted, And the realms of the ice were riven; The white flakes whirl'd like a wingëd cloud Round and over and under; The Earth shriek'd loud from her rending shroud, And the black clouds echoed in thunder! ‘O Balder! Balder!’ And Balder replied, Feeling not seeing his face who cried, ‘I hear!’ ‘And thou other who crouchest there, Gazing up thro' thy hoary hair, Stir not yet till I bid thee go!’ And Death moan'd answer out of the snow, ‘I hear!’ ‘At last the hour hath come, The sky is troubled, the world is shaken, The sleeping gods on their thrones awaken, Altho' their lips are dumb. I feel a breath from the frozen north, For the souls of the slain are faring forth, And their tramp is heard on the frozen ocean, And their tread is swift in the vales of snow. They come, and the great deep throbs below To the sound of their thund'rous motion. O Balder, Balder!’ ‘I hearken, I hearken!’ ‘Thro' the flakes that fall and the ways that darken, Over the earth or over the sea, North is the way that our feet must flee, Till we find them sitting beyond the pole, Gods without pity, gods without soul, Fresh from the slaying of thee. North is the way that our feet must go, Breasting the blasts from the gates of woe, Till we find them there in their sacred places, Gods with their terrible bloodless faces, Writing red-handed for mortal races Black runes on the stainless snow!’ . . . Deeper and darker the night is growing, Faster and faster the clouds are snowing— Fleeter and fleeter the Brethren fly With faces silver'd against the sky, Till close before them, beyond the pole, The aurora flashes its fiery scroll, While the winds of the frozen waste are blowing, And the ice is riven asunder! Lo! ghastly blue with a dreary gleam The bergs of the pole, like ghosts in a dream, Standing pallid against the heaven, Flash with the forks of the fiery levin, And to and fro in the frozen snow, Pass manifold shapes of wonder. Faster, faster, out of the north, The ghosts of Asgard are hurrying forth, And their shields of ice and their spears of hail Clash in the heart of the gathering gale, As they come upon feet of thunder. ‘O Balder! Balder! cling unto me!’ ‘Lift up thy lamp, for I cannot see— I shiver deep to the bitter bone,— While the chilly seeds of the sleet are sown In my flesh, and I feel not thee!’ The lamp is lifted: a dreary light It sheddeth out on the northern night; It comes and goes like the lighthouse ray Lost on the soot-black ocean way. Nought they see and nought they feel, Only the frost with fingers of steel Gripping their throats, so fierce, so fast, Only the breath of the bitter blast Bending their bodies as trees are bent, Rending their garments as clouds are rent, While overhead, with a thund'rous tread, The black heavens frown to trample them down, And the vials of storm are spent. ‘O Balder! Balder! what shadows white Stand in the tempest's shrieking flight? There in the darkness I discern Faces that fade and eyes that burn; They loom in the flash of the thunder-cloud, And the tramp of their feet is as surges that roar, Rolling around, On some desolate rocky shore.’ Then Balder answer'd with eager cry— ‘Cover thy face lest thou droop and die: 'Tis the gods my brethren! I see them plain, Each sitteth there in a spectral pain; They search the waste all round for us, And the light in their eyes is tremulous With the wrath that burns the brain!’ . . . Blacker, blacker, the night is growing, Thicker, faster, the snow is snowing. Silent amid those frozen peaks Sit gods with terrible bloodless cheeks,— Each like a statue of marble stone, Each alone on a lonely throne, With the red aurora upon their hair, They loom in desolate circles there, Silent, with folded wings; They do not stir though the storm drifts by, They do not speak though the wild winds cry, Silent they reign in a starry dream, While the north star flashes its fiery beam, And the serpent lightning springs. . . . Silent they sit,—but who is He Who broods in the centre awfully? Like a pale blue berg in the frosty light, Solemn, speechless, hoary white, Coldly wrapt from head to feet In a robe of snow like a winding-sheet, With a crown of starlight on his hair, He sitteth dreaming with fatal stare, Tho' his throne is strangely shaken. Black is his home, and he sits thereon Still as a mortal whose breath is gone, And the waves are frozen around his feet, And faint, far under, the earthquakes beat, Yet he broods, and doth not waken. ‘O Balder! Balder! who is he Who sitteth there so silently? Who sitteth there so hoary and old, A god in the midst of gods so cold, And hears not at all, though the storm winds call, And the ghosts of Asgard gather?’ Then Balder answer'd, ‘The gods creep here, Weary with seasons of strife and fear— They come, they go—but for ever and aye He stirreth not, be it night or day; Still as a stone, he reigneth alone!’ And Balder raising his hands, made moan, ‘Behold I am risen, my Father!’ V. Alfadur. The rune is woven, the spell is spoken, And lo! the dream of the gods is broken, And each pale throne is shaken. They rise, they tremble against the sky, They shriek an answer to Balder's cry And white as death they waken! Gods they glimmer in frozen mail, Their faces are flashing marble pale, They rise erect, and they wave their hands, They scatter the shifting snows as sands, And gaze in the face of the Father! . . . . . Blacker, blacker, the night is growing, Faster, faster, the snow is snowing— Silently looking thro' the storm, Towers the one gigantic Form, And all around with a trumpet sound The wintry winds are blowing. The light of doom is in his eyes, his arms spread wide for slaughter, He sits 'mid gleams of burning skies and wails of wind-blown water, Behind the outline of his cheeks the pale aurora flashes, He broods 'mid moveless mountain peaks and looks thro' fiery lashes: On heaven and earth that round him float in whirls of snowy wonder, He looks, and from his awful throat there comes the cry of thunder! ‘Balder! Balder!’ . . . ‘He cries on me— He standeth yonder, and beckoneth!’ ‘He looketh around, but he cannot see! Answer him back with a gentle breath, Now the air is still!’ . . . ‘I am here, I am here!’ . . . The cry went up to the godhead drear, Like the cry of a lamb in the midst of the snow, When the voices of tempest have sobbed their fill, And the clouds are still For a little space, and the winds lie low. Then rose in answer a wail so loud It roll'd as thunder from cloud to cloud, And the gods arose in a wingëd crowd, As oft 'mid desolate mountain-peaks, With clangour of wings and hungry shrieks, Great flocks of eagles gather. Tearing asunder their frozen mail, Smiting their breasts with a woful wail, Looming with faces spectral pale, They gazed in the eyes of the Father! Then even as mighty eagles spread Their wings and soar, they arose and fled Crossing the gleam of the fiery north, Facing the dark drift hurrying forth, They flew on flashing pinions; As wild clouds scatter'd across the sky, They wing'd their way with a thundercry. . . . But moveless there, when the rest had flown, The Father sat on his silent throne, Dreary, desolate, all alone, In the midst of the white dominions. ‘Balder! Balder!’ ‘He looks on me! He stirreth now, with a sound like the sea, And he calleth aloud!’ ‘Then move no limb, But crouch in thy place and answer him;— Cry once more full loud and clear, Now he pauseth again!’ . . . ‘I am here, I am here!’ Again the thunder rolling near, Again the tumult of wind and ocean; Around the throne with a serpent motion The meteor snakes appear. White in the midst He stands, the Spirit of God the Master, Waving his wild white hands, urging his snows on faster; But ever darker yet the troubled air grows o'er him, And still with fierce face set he searcheth night before him, And then again, all blind, with black robes blown asunder, He gropeth down the wind, and calls aloud in thunder, ‘Balder, Balder. . . . ‘I see him now, The wrath of heaven is on his brow— He stands in the circle of meteors white, His white feet glimmer like cold moonlight— I can feel his breath!’ ‘Now hold my hand— Rise erect on thy feet and stand— Make answer!’ ‘My Father, I am here!’ As an infant's cry, so faint, so clear, As a young lamb's cry, so soft, so low, Cometh the voice from the waste of snow,— And silence deep as the sleep of ocean, Stillness with no stir, no motion, Follows the sound of the cry. . . . Terrible, desolate, the Form Stands and broods in the midst of the storm, Beneath him wolves of the fierce frost swarm, But quiet and hush'd they lie. With his robe wind-rent and his form windblown He gazeth round and round. He seeth a snow amid the snow And heareth a human sound. ‘Balder! Balder!’ ‘O Father dear, Turn thine eyes and behold me here— Ev'n Balder thy Son!’ ‘I see thee not— Only a gleam on a darken'd spot, And the ray of the light in thy hand!’ ‘Ay me, No light I carry that thou mayst see. What wouldst thou, Father?’ ‘Why hast thou risen? We deem'd thee dead, and we slept in peace— We deem'd thee dead with the snow for prison, That the old sad fear might cease. We deem'd thee dead, and our hearts were light, For never more would thy beauty blight The spirit of Me thy Father!’ Then answer'd Balder, ‘O Father dear, Turn thine eyes, and behold me here— Why hatest thou me?’ ‘We hate thee all For thy summer face, for thy soft footfall, For thy beauty blended of star and flower, For thine earthly love, for thine heavenly dower; For the rune that was written, the rune that was read, We cursed thee all, but our curse was said Deepest and best when we read that rune By thy love for men!’ As the rising moon Creeping up from a cloudy place, A glory grew upon Balder's face— Again he murmur'd, ‘O Father dear, Turn thine eyes and behold me here— Why hatest thou me?’ ‘We hate thee most By the rune that was written, the rune that was lost, By the doom that above thee hung sharp as a sword, When thy feet stood there and thy voice implored For pity of men; and we loved thee least For loosing the yoke of man and beast, For making the hearts of mortals tame, For calming wild hawk-like men who came To thy beck as doves; then we loathed to see The light of thy name upon flower and tree, The peace of thy name upon hill and vale, The love of thy name on the faces pale Of maidens and men; yea, for all these things, For all thy life and the light it brings, We have hated and hate thee unto death.’ But Balder answereth back and saith, ‘Why hatest thou me?’ ‘For this the most! Because thy coming is as the ghost Of the coming doom that shall strike us dead. For the rune was written, the rune was read, And we knew no rest till we bought our breath With the gentle boon of thy willing death. Why hast thou risen? how hast thou risen? We gave thee the frost and the snow for prison, We heard thy sigh and we let thee die, Yet thou criest again with a human cry From the gates of life! . . . But I stoop at last To sweep thee hence with my bitterest blast Out to the heavens of pitiless air, Where nevermore with a human care That face of thine May trouble the eyes of the gods divine! Out 'mong the wingëd stars, deep down the dark abysses, Beyond the black tomb's bars, far from the green Earth's kisses. As dust thou shalt be cast, as snow thou shalt be drifted, Seized by my fiercest blast thou shalt be now uplifted. Call on all living things that stir in sun or shadow— White flowers, sweet forms with wings, wild deer, or lambs o' the meadow; Call on the moonlight now that mingled in thy making; To heaven uplift thy brow, where the pale spheres are waking; On water, air, and fire, on snow and on wind and on forest, Call with a wild desire, now when thy need is sorest! Call now on flower or bird to fill the plight they gave thee! Call, let thy voice be heard, and see if Earth can save thee!’ Behind the back of the Shadow hoar, There grew a trouble, a sullen roar, Roar as of beasts that prepare to come, Trouble like surges that flash to foam; Faster and faster the drift whirl'd round, Deeper and direr grew the sound, And the four fierce winds are blowing! Yet brighter, calmer grew Balder's face, Till a light and a glory fill'd the place, And he rose his height, like a lily white, Like a lily white in the heart of the night, With the flakes around him snowing! VI. The Brethren. ‘Father, Father, why hatest thou me, Whom the green Earth loves, and the circling sea, And the pure blue air, and the light of the sun, And the birds of the air, and the flowers each one? Hatest thou me thro' my love for these? For the swift deep rivers, the fronded trees, The golden meres and the mountains white, The cataracts leaping from height to height, And the deer that feed on the snowy steeps Where the rainbow hangs and the white mist creeps? Hatest thou me the most of all For my care of mortals whom thou hast made, My blessing on lovers whose soft footfall Soundeth still in the flowery shade? Father, Father, hatest thou me, Because of my light on humanity? Because with a holy anointing balm I have heal'd their hearts and kept them calm; Because I have sown in forest and grove The roses of beauty, the lilies of love, That men might gather, and sweeten away The taint of the perishable clay? Father, Father, listen to me— I will not call upon bird or tree, I will not call upon lamb or dove, On the flowers below or the stars above; I will call aloud, and thine ears shall know, I will call aloud in the midst of the snow, On a mortal thing of mortal breath Who has gazed and smiled in the eyes of Death, Who has loosen'd his shround and his feet made free To follow and find me over the sea. . . . . My brother Jesus, hearest thou me!’ Sweet as a star that opens its lids of silver and amber, Soft as a lily that rises out of a water still, Pure as a lamp that burns in a virgin's vestal chamber When winds with folded wings sleep on the scented sill, Pale as the moving snow, yet calmer, clearer, and whiter, Holding the light in his hand, and flashing a ray blood-red, Robed in a silvern robe that ever grew stranger and brighter, Robed in a robe of the snow, with a glory around his head, Christ now arose! and upstanding held the cold hand of his Brother, Turning his face to the storm like the wrath of some beautiful star,— And the sound of the storm was hush'd, and pale grew the face of that Other, He, Alfadur supreme, most direful of all gods that are! ‘Balder! Balder!’ ‘O Father, I listen!’ ‘What shape is this whose sad eyes glisten Bright as the lamp he is uplifting? Round and o'er him snows are drifting, Yet as a still star shineth he, Pale and beautiful like thee. Who is this that standeth there Even as a mortal man, Thin and weary and wan, A lanthorn in his hold, His feet bloody and bare, And a ring of brightest gold Round his hair?’ ‘O Father, 'tis he and none other Who woke me from my tomb; The Christ it is, my Brother, Tho' born of a woman's womb. He has conquer'd the grave, for lo! He died and he rose again! He comes to the silence of snow, From the beautiful regions of rain; And his hair is bright with a peaceful light As the yellow moon's on a summer night, And the flesh on his heart is heapen white To cool an immortal pain!’ Blacker, blacker the night is growing, Deeper, deeper the snow is snowing. . . . As the rigid wave of the ocean-storm Towereth the gigantic Form, And he lifts his hand with a cold command, And the shrill winds answer blowing! A ghastly gleam is on his cheeks, his white robes roll asunder, He raises up his arms and shrieks in his old voice of thunder, ‘The rune was writ, the rune is read—Son, thou hast slain thy Father, The frames are quick that late were dead, and from the grave they gather, The pale One cometh heavenly eyed, as in thy dreams, O Mother! He wakes, he stands by Balder's side as brother smiles by brother. O gods, these live, and must we die? these bloom, and must we wither? Cry with a loud exceeding cry on Death and send him hither! Come, come, O Death! I call on thee—come hither, fleeter, faster! Thou hunter of humanity, thou hound of me thy Master! Slay thou these twain, that we may live, who feed thy throat with slaughter, And blood to quench thee gods will give, shed free as torrent water! Come thou this night, O Death divine, come quickly or come never, And the great Earth shall all be thine for ever and for ever!’ snows are blowing, the Earth is crying, The eagles of storm are shrieking and flying; Thunder-cloud upon thunder-cloud Piled, and flashing and roaring aloud, Roll from the north, and the winds rush forth, And the billows of heaven are breaking. Hand in hand the Brethren stand, Fair and bright in the midst of the night, Fair and bright and marble white, Quiet as babes awaking. . . . But who is he that stirring slow, Wrapt in winding-sheet of snow, Riseth up from the Christ's feet? His golden hair all white with sleet, His eyes all dim, his face snow-pale, He stands erect in the drifting gale! Tall and terrible loometh he, Facing the blast like a frozen tree! ‘Death, Death!’ the god shrieks now— Death, Death, is it surely thou? Death, Death!’ and the god laughs loud, Answer'd by every thunder-cloud, While the snows are falling faster,— ‘Death, Death, there is thy prey!— Take them and tear them and rend them away, As flakes of snow, as drops of spray, In the name of Me thy Master!’ . . . Like two lilies crown'd with gold, Very beauteous to behold, Blown in summer weather, Like two lambs with silvern feet, Very beauteous and sweet, Held together with a chain In some sacrificial fane, The Brethren cling together. Ever fairer still they grow While the noise of storm sinks low, And the Father's snow-white hand Pointeth at them as they stand, And the silent shape of Death Creepeth close and shuddereth! See, O see, the light they wear, On their heads and o'er their hair, Falleth on the Phantom now, Lying softly on his brow. . . . Death, O Death, can this be thou? VII. Father and Son. Now hark, one crieth! ‘My servant Death, Kneeling there with hushëd breath, Listen, ere I bid thee go!’ Death makes answer out of the snow, ‘I hear!’ The Christ hath risen his height, Large and strange in a lonely light, And he lifts his hand and makes the sign Of the blessed cross on his breast divine, And the thrones of the white gods flash like fire, And sink in earthquake around the Sire, Shaken and rent asunder! Then he lifts his hand and he makes the sign Once again on his breast divine, And the mountains of ice around the throne Are troubled like breakers rolling on To the sound of their own thunder! ‘Father! Father!’ Balder cries, With arms outstretch'd and weeping eyes, ‘Father!’—but lo! the white Christ stands, Raising yet his holy hands, And cries, ‘O Death, speed on! speed on! Conquer now and take thy throne— Now all the gods have taken flight, Reign thou there one starless night In the room of him, the Father!’ Slowly over the icy ground, Slow and low like a lean sleuth-hound, Without a breath, without a sound, The phantom form is crawling. He makes no shadow, he leaves no trace, Snow on snow he creepeth apace, Nearer, nearer, the fixëd Face Veil'd with the flakes still falling. ‘Father! Father!’ Balder cries . . . Silent, terrible, under the skies, Sits the God on his throne, with eyes on his Son Whose gentle voice is calling! As the cuckoo calls in the heart of the May Singing the flowers together, As the fountain calls thro' its flashing spray, As a lamb calls low 'mid a mountain-cloud, As a spirit calls to a corpse in its shroud, The Son cries on the Father! VIII. Twilight. The wind is blowing, the skies are snowing, The ice is rent and the rocks are riven, But morning light in the north is growing, Crimson light of the altars of heaven. Silent, still, amidst the storm, Sitteth there the formless Form, Hearkening out of his hoary hair, Waiting on in a dark despair, While the burning heavens flame o'er him! . . . Suddenly, wild and wing'd and bright, Towering to heaven in shroud of white, A phantom upriseth against the light And standeth vast before him. . . . Is it a Shadow, or only the snow? The skies are troubled, the light burns low, But stars still gather and gather. Is it a Shadow, or only the snow, Uprising there in the blood-red glow, Ever towering higher and higher, In a robe of whiteness fringed with fire, Outstretching wings without a cry From verge to verge of the burning sky, With eyes on the eyes of the Father? Now Balder crieth, ‘What shape comes there, Terrible, troubling the heavens and air? Is it Norna the arctic swan, The bright and bodiless Skeleton, Bird-shaped, with a woman's breasts and eyes, Whose wings are wide as the world and skies? Is it Norna, or only the snow, Moving yonder against the glow, Ever towering higher and higher, Ever outspreading pinions dire And looking down in a dumb desire, With eyes on the eyes of the Father!’ It is not Norna, it is not the snow. The skies are troubled; the light burns low; Yet stars still gather and gather. ‘Father! Father! awaken, awaken! One bends above thee with bright hair shaken Over thy throne like a falling flame; One toucheth thy cheek and nameth thy name, In a voice I hear, in a tone I know; It is not Norna, it is not the snow, By the face and the voice and the tone. Vaster than these and vaster than thou, Touching the stars with a shining brow, Flickering up to the twinkling shades Where the wild aurora flashes and fades, Spreading its wings from east to west, As an eagle that looks on a hawk in its nest It hungereth over thy throne! Father! my Father!’ ‘He cannot hear— Hide thy face, for the hour is near— Hush!’ . . . . . . . Who shrieks in the heart of the night? . . . Terrible, desolate, dumb and blind, Like a cloud snow-white Struggling and rent in the claws o' the wind, The Father hath risen with no sound 'Mid the wild winds wavering around, And his stirring deepens the storm. The ice is shaken beneath his tread, The meteors burn around his head, But faster, thicker, out of the skies, Blotting his shape from Balder's eyes, The wild flakes waver and swarm. Now face to face in the blood-red gleam, Like clouds in the sunset, like shapes in a dream, Face to face, with outstretch'd hands Like lightning forks that illume the lands, Face to face, and sight to sight, Like vulture and eagle fierce for fight, They rise and they rise against the skies,— Alfadur with his fiery eyes, And the other vaster Form! It is not Norna, but stranger and brighter, It is not the snow, but wilder and whiter; Ever greater yet it grows Wrapt about with whirling snows, Ever it dilateth on, Till, a crimson Skeleton, With his head against the sky Where the pale lights flicker and die, Strange, he stands, with orbs of fire Looking down upon the Sire. See, O see upon his brow Strangest lustre liveth now, On his neck and round his frame Twines a snake of emerald flame. . . . Death, O Death, can it be thou? ‘Father, father! I cannot see— The heavens are bright, but the world is white, The wings of the wan Form cover thee— Around and around, with no sigh, with no sound, Like the mists of a cloud, like the folds of a shroud, They enwrap thee,—and hide thee from me!’ IX. ‘A Cross and a Lily.’ ‘It is over! O Balder, look up and behold!’ ‘Not yet, for I sicken—my sense shrinketh cold, And I fear the strange silence that cometh at last! All is hush'd—all is dead—the dew now is shed Warm as tears on my hand, but the tempest hath pass'd, And the sounds of the tempest are fled!’ ‘Arise!’ ‘I am risen! ‘Behold! ‘All is white, But the darkness hath gone, and the stars of the night, And down from the north streams the dawn flowing free; But I see not my Father!’ ‘Again! ‘Woe is me! His throne standeth there white and cold, and thereon Sits another I know, as a King on a throne, Yea, sceptred and crownëd . . . and vaster tenfold He seems than the Spirit who sat there of old, For his form 'gainst the heavens looms fiery and fair, And the dew of the dawn burneth bright on his hair; And we twain unto him are as birds in the night That sit gazing up at a great snowy height Where the starlight is coming and going like breath.’ ‘So strange and so changed, yet 'tis he, even Death,— Best and least, last and first. He hath conquer'd his own. All gods are as sand round his feet tempest-blown, And lesser yet greater, more weak yet more wise, Are we who stand here looking up in his eyes. All hail now to Death, since the great gods are dead!’ ‘Woe is me—it was written, and lo! it is read!’ ‘Come together, and bless him!’ ‘My Father?’ ‘The same. On his throne I will mark with a finger of flame A cross and a lily for thee and for me!’ They pass o'er the ice, and a sound like the sea Grows under their footprints; and softly they come Where Death, with his eyes fix'd on heaven, sitteth dumb; And they pause at his feet, while far o'er them he looms With his brow 'mong the stars and the amethyst glooms, Yea, they pause far beneath, and with finger divine The white Christ hath made on the snow for a sign The cross and the lily . . . then rising he stands, And looketh at Death with uplifting of hands. Still as a star he shineth, brightly his eyes are burning, White as a dove he seems in the morning's dewy breath, Lifting again his face with a smile of loving and yearning, He looketh gently up at the godlike shape of Death; And the hair of Death is golden, the face of Death is glowing, While softly around his form he folds his mighty wings, And vast as the vast blue heavens the fair faint form is growing, But the face that all men fear is bright with beautiful things. Ev'n so the Brethren wait where the darkest snows are drifted, Small as two doves that light in a wilderness alone, While bright on the blood-red skies, with luminous head uplifted, In a dream divine upgazing, Death sitteth upon his throne. IX. THE LAST BLESSING. I. The Waking of the Sea. ‘All that is beautiful shall abide, All that is base shall die.’ Hark! birds are singing far and wide, Under the summer sky. . . . Southward across the shining Bow The blessed Brethren came; They wore soft raiment of the snow And sandals shod with flame. And golden lights and rippling rains Were on the frozen sea, The bergs were melting from their chains, The waters flashing free. The white Christ lifted hands above The silent wakening Deep, And the unseen depths began to move With motions soft as sleep. Then on an isle of ice he stept, Leading his Brother mild, And blest the waters as they slept, And lo, they woke and smiled! Around him on the melting sea The glittering icebergs stirred, And glimmer'd southward silently, Like things that lived and heard. Then, like a ship on the still tide That slowly leaveth land, His own white isle began to glide At lifting of his hand. Silently as a flock of sheep The bergs stirred in the sun, Shepherded gently down the Deep By that immortal one. For as he raised his snow-white hand, They crept full softly by,— Or paused and stood, as fair flocks stand Under the shepherd's eye. Far, far away into the north They stretch'd in legions white, Trembling and changing, creeping forth Out of a crimson light. And all the colours of the Bow Down their bright sides were shed; Above the sky was gold; below, The sea all rippling red! II. From Death to Life. Bright Balder at his brother's feet Lay looking on the sea, And sea-birds hover'd white and sweet Around him, silently. And white bears crawl'd out of the Deep To see him, and were blest; And black seals with their young did creep Upon the berg to rest. Brighter and fairer all around The kindling waters shone; And softly, swiftly, with no sound, The white flocks glided on. And far away on every side The glittering ice-blink grew,— Millions of bergs like ships that ride Upon the waters blue. O Balder, Balder, wherefore hide Thy face from the blue sky!’ The voice was music, but it cried Like any human cry. ‘O Balder, Balder,’ the white Christ said, ‘Look up and answer me.’ Bright Balder raised his golden head, Like sunrise on the sea. ‘O Brother, I was weeping then For those whom Death o'erthrew. Shall I, whose eyes have mourn'd for men, Not mourn my brethren too?’ The white Christ answer'd back, and cried, Shining under the sky, ‘All that is beautiful shall abide, All that is base shall die. ‘And if among thy sleeping kin One soul divine there be, That soul shall walk the world and win New life, with thee and me. ‘Death shall not harm one holy hair, Nor blind one face full sweet; Death shall not mar what Love made fair; Nay, Death shall kiss their feet!’ Then Balder rose his heavenly height, And clear as day smiled he; His smile was bright as noonday light Upon the sparkling sea. Turning his face unto the north, He utter'd up a prayer, He saw the great Bridge stretching forth, But never a god walk'd there. He pray'd for those great gods o'erthrown And cast in Death's eclipse, He named the goddesses each one, And blest them with his lips. And lo! from bright'ning far-off lands He saw glad spirits gleam, Gazing to sea, and waving hands, And singing in a dream; And far away where earth and air Mingled their gentle lights, There stood one marble form most fair Upon the cloudless heights. Against the calm and stainless blue It stood divinely dim, And lo, his mother's form he knew, And felt her eyes on him! Silent she paused, serene and crown'd, Amid a summer sheen And cataracts flash'd their lights around, And woods grew dewy green. Softly he sail'd beyond her sight Upon the summer sea, And once again with hands snow-white He blest all things that be. And brighter, brighter, as he blest, The loosen'd Ocean grew, And all the icebergs rock'd at rest Upon the waters blue. Along the melting shores of earth An emerald flame there ran, Forest and field grew bright, and mirth Gladden'd the flocks of Man. Then glory grew on earth and heaven, Full glory of full day! Then the bright rainbow's colours seven On every iceberg lay! In Balder's hand Christ placed his own, And it was golden weather, And on that berg as on a throne The Brethren stood together! And countless voices far and wide Sang sweet beneath the sky— ‘All that is beautiful shall abide, All that is base shall die!’ Miscellaneous Poems and Ballads. (1878-83.) Clown. What hast here? Ballads?Mop. Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o' life, for then we are sure they are true.Aut. Here's one to a very doleful tune. . . . This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one. The Winter's Tale. DEDICATION To Harriett. Here at the Half-way House of Life I linger, Worn with the way, a weary-hearted Singer, Resting a little space; And lo! the good God sends me, as a token Of peace and blessing (else my heart were broken), The sunbeam of thy face. My fear falls from me like a garment; slowly New strength returns upon me, calm and holy; I kneel, and I atone. . . Thy hand is clasped in mine—we lean together. . Henceforward, through the sad or shining weather, I shall not walk alone. THE STRANGE COUNTRY. I have come from a mystical Land of Light To a Strange Country; The Land I have left is forgotten quite In the Land I see. The round Earth rolls beneath my feet, And the still Stars glow, The murmuring Waters rise and retreat, The Winds come and go. Sure as a heart-beat all things seem In this Strange Country; So sure, so still, in a dazzle of dream, All things flow free. 'Tis life, all life, be it pleasure or pain, In the Field and the Flood, In the beating Heart, in the burning Brain, In the Flesh and the Blood. Deep as Death is the daily strife Of this Strange Country: All things thrill up till they blossom in Life, And flutter and flee. Nothing is stranger than the rest, From the pole to the pole, The weed by the way, the eggs in the nest, The Flesh and the Soul. Look in mine eyes, O Man I meet In this Strange Country! Lie in mine arms, O Maiden sweet, With thy mouth kiss me! Go by, O King, with thy crownèd brow And thy sceptred hand— Thou art a straggler too, I vow, From the same strange Land. O wondrous Faces that upstart In this Strange Country! O Souls, O Shades, that become a part Of my Soul and me! What are ye working so fast and fleet, O Humankind? ‘We are building Cities for those whose feet Are coming behind; ‘Our stay is short, we must fly again From this Strange Country; But others are growing, women and men, Eternally!’ Child, what art thou? and what am I? But a breaking wave! Rising and rolling on, we hie To the shore of the grave. I have come from a mystical Land of Light To this Strange Country; This dawn I came, I shall go to-night, Ay me! ay me! I hold my hand to my head and stand 'Neath the air's blue arc, I try to remember the mystical Land, But all is dark. And all around me swim Shapes like mine In this Strange Country;— They break in the glamour of gleams divine, And they moan ‘Ay me!’ Like waves in the cold Moon's silvern breath They gather and roll, Each crest of white is a birth or a death, Each sound is a Soul. Oh, whose is the Eye that gleams so bright O'er this Strange Country? It draws us along with a chain of light, As the Moon the Sea! THE BALLAD OF JUDAS ISCARIOT. 'Twas the body of Judas Iscariot Lay in the Field of Blood; 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Beside the body stood. Black was the earth by night, And black was the sky; Black, black were the broken clouds, Tho' the red Moon went by. 'Twas the body of Judas Iscariot Strangled and dead lay there; 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Look'd on it in despair. The breath of the World came and went Like a sick man's in rest; Drop by drop on the World's eyes The dews fell cool and blest. Then the soul of Judas Iscariot Did make a gentle moan— ‘I will bury underneath the ground My flesh and blood and bone. ‘I will bury deep beneath the soil, Lest mortals look thereon, And when the wolf and raven come The body will be gone! ‘The stones of the field are sharp as steel, And hard and cold, God wot; And I must bear my body hence Until I find a spot!’ 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot, So grim, and gaunt, and gray, Raised the body of Judas Iscariot, And carried it away. And as he bare it from the field Its touch was cold as ice, And the ivory teeth within the jaw Rattled aloud, like dice. As the soul of Judas Iscariot Carried its load with pain, The Eye of Heaven, like a lanthorn's eye, Open'd and shut again. Half he walk'd, and half he seemed Lifted on the cold wind; He did not turn, for chilly hands Were pushing from behind. The first place that he came unto It was the open wold, And underneath were prickly whins, And a wind that blew so cold. The next place that he came unto It was a stagnant pool, And when he threw the body in It floated light as wool. He drew the body on his back, And it was dripping chill, And the next place he came unto Was a Cross upon a hill. A Cross upon the windy hill, And a Cross on either side, Three skeletons that swing thereon, Who had been crucified. And on the middle cross-bar sat A white Dove slumbering; Dim it sat in the dim light, With its head beneath its wing. And underneath the middle Cross A grave yawn'd wide and vast, But the soul of Judas Iscariot Shiver'd, and glided past. The fourth place that he came unto It was the Brig of Dread, And the great torrents rushing down Were deep, and swift, and red. He dared not fling the body in For fear of faces dim And arms were waved in the wild water To thrust it back to him. Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Turned from the Brig of Dread, And the dreadful foam of the wild water Had splashed the body red. For days and nights he wandered on Upon an open plain, And the days went by like blinding mist, And the nights like rushing rain. For days and nights he wandered on, All thro' the Wood of Woe; And the nights went by like moaning wind, And the days like drifting snow. 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Came with a weary face— Alone, alone, and all alone, Alone in a lonely place! He wandered east, he wandered west, And heard no human sound; For months and years, in grief and tears, He wandered round and round. For months and years, in grief and tears, He walked the silent night; Then the soul of Judas Iscariot Perceived a far-off light. A far-off light across the waste, As dim as dim might be, That came and went like the lighthouse gleam On a black night at sea. 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Crawl'd to the distant gleam; And the rain came down, and the rain was blown Against him with a scream. For days and nights he wandered on, Push'd on by hands behind; And the days went by like black, black rain, And the nights like rushing wind. 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot, Strange, and sad, and tall, Stood all alone at dead of night Before a lighted hall. And the wold was white with snow, And his foot-marks black and damp, And the ghost of the silvern Moon arose, Holding her yellow lamp. And the icicles were on the eaves, And the walls were deep with white, And the shadows of the guests within Pass'd on the window light. The shadows of the wedding guests Did strangely come and go, And the body of Judas Iscariot Lay stretch'd along the snow. The body of Judas Iscariot Lay stretched along the snow; 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Ran swiftly to and fro. To and fro, and up and down, He ran so swiftly there, As round and round the frozen Pole Glideth the lean white bear. 'Twas the Bridegroom sat at the table-head, And the lights burnt bright and clear— ‘Oh, who is that,’ the Bridegroom said, ‘Whose weary feet I hear?’ 'Twas one look'd from the lighted hall, And answered soft and slow, ‘It is a wolf runs up and down With a black track in the snow.’ The Bridegroom in his robe of white Sat at the table-head— ‘Oh, who is that who moans without?’ The blessed Bridegroom said. 'Twas one looked from the lighted hall, And answered fierce and low, ‘'Tis the soul of Judas Iscariot Gliding to and fro.’ 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Did hush itself and stand, And saw the Bridegroom at the door With a light in his hand. The Bridegroom stood in the open door, And he was clad in white, And far within the Lord's Supper Was spread so broad and bright. The Bridegroom shaded his eyes and look'd, And his face was bright to see— ‘What dost thou here at the Lord's Supper With thy body's sins?’ said he. 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Stood black, and sad, and bare— ‘I have wandered many nights and days; There is no light elsewhere.’ 'Twas the wedding guests cried out within, And their eyes were fierce and bright— ‘Scourge the soul of Judas Iscariot Away into the night!’ The Bridegroom stood in the open door, And he waved hands still and slow, And the third time that he waved his hands The air was thick with snow. And of every flake of falling snow, Before it touched the ground, There came a dove, and a thousand doves Made sweet sound. 'Twas the body of Judas Iscariot Floated away full fleet, And the wings of the doves that bare it off Were like its winding-sheet. 'Twas the Bridegroom stood at the open door, And beckon'd, smiling sweet; 'Twas the soul of Judas Iscariot Stole in, and fell at his feet. ‘The Holy Supper is spread within, And the many candles shine, And I have waited long for thee Before I poured the wine!’ The supper wine is poured at last, The lights burn bright and fair, Iscariot washes the Bridegroom's feet, And dries them with his hair. THE LIGHTS OF LEITH. I. ‘The lights o' Leith! the lights o' Leith!’ The skipper cried aloud— While the wintry gale with snow and hail Blew snell thro' sail and shroud. ‘The lights o' Leith! the lights o' Leith!’ As he paced the deck cried he— ‘How merrily bright they burn this night Thro' the reek o' the stormy sea!’ As the ship ran in thro' the surging spray Afire seemed all the town; They saw the glare from far away, And, safely steer'd to the land-lock'd bay, They cast their anchor down. ‘'Tis sure a feast in the town o' Leith (To his mate the skipper spoke), ‘And yonder shadows that come and go, Across the quay where the bonfires glow, Are the merry-making folk. ‘In right good time we are home once more From the wild seas and rough weather— Come, launch a boat, and we'll run ashore, And see the sport together.’ But the mate replied, while he shoreward gazed With sad and gentle eyes, While the lights of Leith beyond him blazed And he heard the landward cries: ‘'Tis twenty lang year since I first left here, In the time o' frost and snaw— I was only a lad, and my heart was mad To be up, and free, and awa’! ‘My mither she prayed me no' to gang, For she had nae bairn but me— My father was droon'd, and sleeping amang The weeds o' the northern sea. ‘I stole awa’ in the mirk o' night And left my mither asleep, And ere she waken'd, at morning light, I was oot on the roaring deep. ‘Aye, twenty lang year hae past sin' syne, And my heart has aft been sair To think o' that puir auld mither o' mine, Alane, in a warld o' care. ‘When back I cam’ frae the salt sea faem I was a bearded man, Ae simmer I dwelt in the hoose at hame, Then awa' to the sea I ran. ‘And twice sin’ syne hae I left the sea To seek the hameward track, And eye my mither had had for me— Tho' ne'er a gift had my hands to gie— A tender welcome back. ‘Then, cast awa’ in a soothern land, And taen to slaverie, I lang'd for the touch o' a mither's hand And the glint o' a mither's e'e. ‘But noo that my wandering days are done, I hae dree'd a penance sad, I am coming hame, like the Prodigal Son, But wi' siller to mak' her glad! ‘I hae gowden rings for my mither's hand, Bonnie and braw past dream, And, fit for a leddy o' the land, A shawl o' the Indian seam. ‘And I lang, and lang, to seek ance mair The cot by the side o' the sea, And to find my gray old mither there, Waiting and watching for me; ‘To dress her oot like a leddy grand, While the tears o' gladness drap, To put the rings on her wrinkled hand, The siller intil her lap! ‘And to say “O mither, I'm hame, I'm hame! Forgie me, O forgie! And never mair shall ye ken a care Until the day you dee!” ’ O bright and red shone the lights of Leith In the snowy winter-tide— Down the cheeks of the man the salt tears ran, As he stood by the skipper's side. ‘But noo I look on the lights o' hame My heart sinks sick and cauld— Lest I come owre late for her love or blame, For oh! my mither was auld! ‘For her een were dim when I sail'd awa’, And snaw was on her heid, And I fear—I fear—after mony a year, To find my mither—deid! ‘Sae I daurna enter the toon o' Leith, Where the merry yule-fires flame, Lest I hear the tidings o' dule and death, Ere I enter the door o' hame. ‘But ye'll let them row me to yonner shore Beyond the lights o' the quay, And I'll climb the brae to the cottage door, A hunnerd yards frae the sea. ‘If I see a light thro' the mirk o' night, I'll ken my mither is there; I'll keek, maybe, through the pane, and see Her face in its snawy hair! ‘The face sae dear that for mony a year I hae prayed to see again,— O a mither's face has a holy grace 'Bune a' the faces o' men! ‘Then I'll enter in wi’ silent feet, And saftly cry her name— And I'll see the dim auld een grow sweet Wi' a heavenly welcome hame! ‘And I'll cry, “O mither, I'm here, I'm here! Forgie me, O forgie! And never mair shall ye ken a care! Your son shall lea' thee never mair To sail on the stormy sea!” ’ II. They row'd him to the lonely shore Beyond the lights of the quay, And he climb'd the brae to the cottage door A hundred yards from the sea. He saw no light thro' the mirk of night, And his heart sank down with dread, ‘But 'tis late,’ thought he, ‘and she lies, maybe, Soond sleeping in her bed!’ Half-way he paused, for the blast blew keen, And the sea roar'd loud below, And he turn'd his face to the town-lights, seen Thro' the white and whirling snow. The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! How they flash'd on the night-black bay, White with sullen roar on the rocky shore The waters splash'd their spray! When close he came to the lonely cot, He paused in deeper dread,— For the gleam that came from the far-off flame Just touch'd the walls with red; Thro' the doorway dark did the bleak wind blow, The windows were black and bare, And the house was floor'd with the cruel snow, And roof'd with the empty air! ‘O mither, mither!’ he moan'd aloud, ‘And are ye deid and gane? Hae I waited in tears thro' the weary years, And a' in vain, in vain?’ He stood on the hearth, while the snow swam drear Between the roofless walls— ‘O mither! mither! come here, come here,— 'Tis your ain son, Robin, calls!’ On his eager ears, as he stood in tears, There came a faint foot-tread— Then out of the storm crept a woman's form With hooded face and head. Like a black, black ghost the shape came near Till he heard its heavy breath— ‘What man,’ it sighed, ‘stands sabbing here, In the wearifu’ hoose o' death?’ ‘Come hither, come hither, whae'er ye be,’ He answer'd loud and clear— ‘I am Robin Sampson, come hame frae the sea, And I seek my mither dear!’ ‘O Robin, Robin,’ a voice cried sobbing, ‘O Robin, and is it yersel'? I'm Janet Wylie, lame Janet Wylie, Your kissen, frae Marywell!’ ‘O Robin, Robin,’ again she cried, ‘O Robin, and can it be? Ah, better far had the wind and the tide Ne'er brought ye across the sea!’ Wailing she sank on the snow-heap'd hearth, And rocked her body in pain— ‘O Robin, Robin,’ she cried to him sobbing, Your mither—your mither—is gane!’ The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! How brightly still they glow! The faint flame falls on the ruined walls, On the hearthstone heap'd in snow! ‘O Janet, Janet, kind cousin Janet, If ever ye cared for me, Noo let me hear o' my mither dear, And hoo she cam' to dee!’ Wailing she lifted her weeping face, And answer'd in soul's despair— ‘O Robin, awa' frae the wicked place— Awa'—and ask nae mair!’ But he grasp'd her arm with a grip of steel And cried ‘O Janet, speak!’ ‘O Robin dear, dinna seek to hear, For oh! your heart must breik!’ But he pressed her more, and he pleaded sore, Till at last the tale was told, And he listened on, till the tale was done, Like a man death-struck and cold. III. ‘O Robin dear, when ye sail'd awa', That last time, on the sea, We knew her heart was breiking in twa, And we thought that she wad dee. ‘But after a while she forced a smile— “I'll greet nae mair,” said she, “But I'll wait and pray that the Lord, aeday, May bring him again to me! ‘“The Lord is guid, and Robin my son As kind as a bairn can be— Aye true as steel, and he loes me weel, Tho' he's gane across the sea.” ‘O Robin, Robin, baith late and air' She prayed and prayed for thee, But evermair when the blast blew sair, She was langest on her knee!’ The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! That flame o'er sea and skies! How bright they glow!—while the salt tears flow From that bearded mariner's eyes. ‘But, Robin, your mither was auld and pair, And the season's cauld and keen; The white, white snaw was on her hair, The frost film ower her een. ‘And here in the hut beside the sea, The pair auld wife did dwell— Her only kin were my mither and me, And we were as pair's hersel'. ‘She leeved on a handfu’ o' barley meal, A drink frae the spring sae cauld— O Robin, Robin, a heart o' steel Might bleed for the weak and auld! ‘In twa she was bent, on a staff she leant, Wi' ragged duds for claise, And wearifu' up and doon she went, Gath'ring her sticks and straes. ‘And the weans wad thrang as she creepit alang, And point, and cry sae shrill— “There's Grannie Sampson,” was ever their sang, “The wicked witch o' the hill!” ‘Ah, mony's the time up the hill she'd climb, While the imps wad scream and craw— At the door she'd stand, wi' her staff in hand, And angrily screech them awa'! ‘Then wi' feeble feet creeping ben, she'd greet That the warld misca'd her sae, And wi' face as white as the winding-sheet, She'd kneel by the bed, and pray. ‘O Robin, Robin, she prayed for him Wha sail'd in the wild sea-rack, And the tears wad drap frae her een sae dim, As she prayed for her bairn to come back! ‘Then whiles . . . when she thought nae folk were near . . . (O Robin, she thought nae harm! But stoop your heid, lest they hear, lest they hear!) She tried . . . an auld-farrant charm. ‘A charm aft tried in the ingleside When bairns are blythesome and free, A charm (come near, lest they hear, lest they hear!) To bring her boy hame from the sea! ‘And the auld black cat at her elbow sat, (The cat you gied her yersel') And the folk, keeking in thro' the pane, saw a sin, And thought she was weaving a spell!’ The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! They flame on the wintry gale! With sore drawn breath, and a face like death, He hearks to the gruesome tale! ‘O Robin, Robin, I kenna hoo The lee was faither'd first, But (whisper again, lest they ken, lest they ken!) They thought the puir body accurst! ‘They thought the spell had been wrought in Hell, To kill and curse and blight, They thought she flew, when naebody knew, To a Sabbath o' fiends, ilk night! ‘Then ane whose corn had wither'd ae morn, And ane whose kye sicken'd doon, Crept, scared and pale, wi' the leein' tale, To the meenisters, up the toon. ‘Noo, Robin, jest then, King Jamie the King Was oot at sea in his bark, And the bark nigh sank unner, wi' fire-flaught and thunner, And they thought—the Deil was at wark! ‘The King cam' to land, and loup'd on the strand, Pale as a ghaist and afraid, Wi' courtiers and clergy, a wild fearfu' band, He ran to the kirk, and prayed. ‘Then the clergy made oot 'twas witchcraft, nae doot, And searchit up and doon, And . . . foond your auld mither (wae's me!) and twa ither, And dragg'd them up to the toon! ‘O Robin, dear Robin, hearken nae mair!’ ‘Speak on, I'll heark to the en'!’ ‘O Robin, Robin, the sea oot there Is kinder than cruel men! ‘They took her before King Jamie the King, Whaur he sat wi' sceptre and croon, And the cooard courtiers stood in a ring, And the meenisters gather'd roon'. ‘They bade her tell she had wrought the spell That made the tempest blaw; They strippit her bare as a naked bairn, They tried her wi' pincers and heated airn, Till she shriek'd and swoon'd awa'! ‘O Robin, Robin, the King sat there, While the cruel deed was done, And the clergy o' Christ ne'er bade him spare For the sake o' God's ain Son!. . . . The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! Like Hell's own lights they glow While the sailor stands, with his trembling hands Prest hard on his heart in woe! ‘O Robin, Robin . . . they doom'd her to burn . . . Doon yonner upon the quay . . . This night was the night . . . see the light! see the light! How it burns by the side o' the sea!’ . . . She paused with a moan. . . . He had left her alone, And rushing through drift and snow, Down the side of the wintry hill he had flown, His eyes on the lights below! IV. The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! They flame on the eyes of the crowd, Around, up and down, move the folk of the town, While the bells of the kirk peal aloud! High up on the quay, blaze the balefires, and see! Three stakes are deep set in the ground, To each stake smear'd with pitch clings the corpse of a witch, With the fire flaming redly around! What madman is he who leaps in where they gleam, Close, close, to the centremost form? ‘O mither, O mither!’ he cries, with a scream, That rings thro' the heart of the storm! He can see the white hair snowing down thro' the glare, The white face upraised to the skies— Then the cruel red blaze blots the thing from his gaze, And he falls on his face,—and dies. V. The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! See, see! they are flaming still! Thro' the clouds of the past their flame is cast, While the Sabbath bells ring shrill! The lights of Leith! the lights of Leith! They'll burn till the Judgment Day! Till the Church's curse and the monarch's shame, And the sin that slew in the Blessed Name, Are burned and purg'd away! Note.—The foundation of this ballad is historical, more particularly the part taken by the enlightened pedant, James VI. of Scotland, who, on his accession to the English throne, procured the infamous statute against witchcraft, which actually remained unrepealed till 1736, and even then was repealed under strong protest from the Scottish clergy! One traveller, as late as 1664, casually notices the fact of having seen nine witches burning together at Leith, and in 1678, nine others were condemned in a single day.— R. B. THE WEDDING OF SHON MACLEAN. A BAGPIPE MELODY. To the wedding of Shon Maclean, Twenty Pipers together Came in the wind and the rain Playing across the heather; Backward their ribbons flew, Blast upon blast they blew, Each clad in tartan new, Bonnet, and blackcock feather: And every Piper was fou, Pronounce foo—i.e. ‘half seas over,’ intoxicated. Twenty Pipers together! . . . He's but a Sassenach blind and vain Who never heard of Shon Maclean— The Duke's own Piper, called ‘Shon the Fair,’ From his freckled skin and his fiery hair. Father and son, since the world's creation, The Macleans had followed this occupation, And played the pibroch to fire the Clan Since the first Duke came and the Earth began. Like the whistling of birds, like the humming of bees, Like the sough of the south-wind in the trees, Like the singing of angels, the playing of shawms, Like Ocean itself with its storms and its calms, Were the strains of Shon, when with cheeks aflame He blew a blast thro' the pipes of fame. At last, in the prime of his playing life, The spirit moved him to take a wife— A lassie with eyes of Highland blue, Who loved the pipes and the Piper too, And danced to the sound, with a foot and a leg White as a lily and smooth as an egg. So, twenty Pipers were coming together O'er the moor and across the heather, All in the wind and the rain: Twenty Pipers so brawly dressed Were flocking in from the east and west, To bless the bedding and blow their best At the wedding of Shon Maclean. At the wedding of Shon Maclean 'Twas wet and windy weather! Yet, thro' the wind and the rain Came twenty Pipers together! Earach and Dougal Dhu, Sandy of Isla too, Each with the bonnet o' blue, Tartan, and blackcock feather: And every Piper was fou, Twenty Pipers together! The knot was tied, the blessing said, Shon was married, the feast was spread. At the head of the table sat, huge and hoar, Strong Sandy of Isla, age fourscore, Whisker'd, grey as a Haskeir seal, And clad in crimson from head to heel. Beneath and round him in their degree Gathered the men of minstrelsie, With keepers, gillies, and lads and lasses, Mingling voices, and jingling glasses. At soup and haggis, at roast and boil'd, Awhile the happy gathering toil'd,— While Shon and Jean at the table ends Shook hands with a hundred of their friends.— Then came a hush. Thro' the open door A wee bright form flash'd on the floor,— The Duke himself, in the kilt and plaid, With slim soft knees, like the knees of a maid. And he took a glass, and he cried out plain ‘I drink to the health of Shon Maclean! To Shon the Piper and Jean his wife, A clean fireside and a merry life!’ Then out he slipt, and each man sprang To his feet, and with ‘hooch’ the chamber rang! ‘Clear the tables!’ shriek'd out one— A leap, a scramble,—and it was done! And then the Pipers all in a row Tuned their pipes and began to blow, While all to dance stood fain: Sandy of Isla and Earach More, Dougal Dhu from Kinflannan shore, Played up the company on the floor At the wedding of Shon Maclean. At the wedding of Shon Maclean, Twenty Pipers together Stood up, while all their train Ceased to clatter and blether. Full of the mountain-dew, First in their pipes they blew, Mighty of bone and thew, Red-cheek'd, with lungs of leather: And every Piper was fou, Twenty Pipers together! Who led the dance? In pomp and pride The Duke himself led out the Bride! Great was the joy of each beholder, For the wee Duke only reach'd her shoulder; And they danced, and turned, when the reel began, Like a giantess and a fairie man! But like an earthquake was the din When Shon himself led the Duchess in! And she took her place before him there, Like a white mouse dancing with a bear! So trim and tiny, so slim and sweet, Her blue eyes watching Shon's great feet, With a smile that could not be resisted, She jigged, and jumped, and twirl'd, and twisted! Sandy of Isla led off the reel, The Duke began it with toe and heel, Then all join'd in amain; Twenty Pipers ranged in a row, From squinting Shamus to lame Kilcroe, Their cheeks like crimson, began to blow, At the wedding of Shon Maclean. At the wedding of Shon Maclean They blew with lungs of leather, And blithesome was the strain Those Pipers played together! Moist with the mountain-dew, Mighty of bone and thew, Each with the bonnet o' blue, Tartan, and blackcock feather: And every Piper was fou, Twenty Pipers together! Oh for a wizard's tongue to tell Of all the wonders that befell! Of how the Duke, when the first stave died, Reached up on tiptoe to kiss the Bride, While Sandy's pipes, as their mouths were meeting, Skirl'd, and set every heart a-beating! Then Shon took the pipes! and all was still, As silently he the bags did fill, With flaming cheeks and round bright eyes, Till the first faint music began to rise. Like a thousand laverocks singing in tune, Like countless corn-craiks under the moon, Like the smack of kisses, like sweet bells ringing, Like a mermaid's harp, or a kelpie singing, Blew the pipes of Shon; and the witching strain Was the gathering song of the Clan Maclean! Then slowly, softly, at his side, All the Pipers around replied, And swelled the solemn strain: The hearts of all were proud and light, To hear the music, to see the sight, And the Duke's own eyes were dim that night, At the wedding of Shon Maclean. So to honour the Clan Maclean Straight they began to gather, Blowing the wild refrain, ‘Blue bonnets across the heather!’ They stamp'd, they strutted, they blew; They shriek'd; like cocks they crew; Blowing the notes out true, With wonderful lungs of leather: And every Piper was fou, Twenty Pipers together! When the Duke and Duchess went away The dance grew mad and the guests grew gay; Man and maiden, face to face, Leapt and footed and scream'd apace! Round and round the dancers whirl'd, Shriller, louder, the Pipers skirl'd, Till the soul seem'd swooning into sound, And all creation was whirling round! Then, in a pause of the dance and glee, The Pipers, ceasing their minstrelsie, Draining the glass in groups did stand, And passed the sneesh-box Snuff-box. from hand to hand. Sandy of Isla, with locks of snow, Squinting Shamus, blind Kilmahoe, Finlay Beg, and Earach More, Dougal Dhu of Kilflannan shore— All the Pipers, black, yellow, and green, All the colours that ever were seen, All the Pipers of all the Macs, Gather'd together and took their cracks. Conversed sociably. Then (no man knows how the thing befell, For none was sober enough to tell) These heavenly Pipers from twenty places Began disputing with crimson faces; Each asserting, like one demented, The claims of the Clan he represented. In vain grey Sandy of Isla strove To soothe their struggle with words of love, Asserting there, like a gentleman, The superior claims of his own great Clan; Then, finding to reason is despair, He seizes his pipes and he plays an air— The gathering tune of his Clan—and tries To drown in music the shrieks and cries! Heavens! Every Piper, grown mad with ire, Seizes his pipes with a fierce desire, And blowing madly, with skirl and squeak, Begins his particular tune to shciek! Up and down the gamut they go, Twenty Pipers, all in a row, Each with a different strain! Each tries hard to drown the first, Each blows louder till like to burst. Thus were the tunes of the Clans rehearst At the wedding of Shon Maclean! At the wedding of Shon Maclean, Twenty Pipers together, Blowing with might and main, Thro' wonderful lungs of leather! Wild was the hullabaloo! They stamp'd, they scream'd, they crew! Twenty strong blasts they blew, Holding the heart in tether: And every Piper was fou, Twenty Pipers together! A storm of music! Like wild sleuth-hounds Contending together, were the sounds! At last a bevy of Eve's bright daughters Pour'd oil—that's whisky—upon the waters; And after another dram wen, down The Pipers chuckled and ceased to frown, Embraced like brothers and kindred spirits, And fully admitted each other's merits. All bliss must end! For now the Bride Was looking weary and heavy-eyed, And soon she stole from the drinking chorus, While the company settled to deoch-andorus. The parting glass; lit. the cup at the door One hour—another—took its flight— The clock struck twelve—the dead of night— And still the Bride like a rose so red Lay lonely up in the bridal bed. At half-past two the Bridegroom, Shon, Dropt on the table as heavy as stone, But four strong Pipers across the floor Carried him up to the bridal door, Push'd him in at the open portal, And left him snoring, serene and mortal! The small stars twinkled over the heather, As the Pipers wandered away together, But one by one on the journey dropt, Clutching his pipes, and there he stopt! One by one on the dark hillside Each faint blast of the bagpipes died, Amid the wind and the rain! And the twenty Pipers at break of day In twenty different bogholes lay, Serenely sleeping upon their way From the wedding of Shon Maclean! HANS VOGEL. AN EPISODE OF THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR. ‘Ein ächter Deutscher Mann mag keinen Franzen leiden!’— Brander in Faust. The fight is o'er, the day is done, And thro' the clouds o'erhead The fingers of the setting sun Are pointing down blood-red,— Beneath, on the white battlefield, Lie strewn the drifts of dead. No breath, no stir; but everywhere The cold Frost crawleth slow, And Frank and Teuton side by side Lie stiffening in the snow,— While piteously each marble face Gleams in the ruby glow. No sound; but yonder midst the dead There stands one steed snow-white, And clinging to its chilly mane, Half swooning, yet upright, Its rider totters, breathing hard, Bareheaded in the light! Hans Vogel. Spectacles on nose, He gasps and gazes round— He shivers as his eyes survey That wintry battle-ground— Then, parch'd with thirst and chill with cold, He sinks, without a sound. Before his vision as he lies There gleams a quaint old Town, He sees the students in the street Swaggering up and down, While at a casement sits a Maid In clean white cap and gown. Hans Vogel thinks, ‘My time hath come! Ne'er shall these eyes of mine Behold poor Ännchen, or the trees Of dear old Ehbrenstein!’ He smacks his lips, ‘Mein Gott! for one Deep draught of Rhenish wine!’ Then swift as thought his wild eyes gleam On something at his side— He stirs—he glares—he sits erect— He grips it, eager-eyed: A Flask it is, some friend or foe Hath dropt there ere he died! To God he mutters now a prayer, Quaking in every limb; Trembling he holds it to the light!— 'Tis full unto the brim! A flask, a brimming flask of wine! And God hath sent it him! Hans Vogel's heart leaps up in joy, ‘Dem Himmel sei Dank!’ he cries— Then pursing out his thirsty lips Prepares to quaff his prize,— When lo! a sound—he starts—and meets A pair of burning eyes! Propt on a bed of comrades dead, His faint breath swiftly flying, His breast torn open by a shell, A Grenadier is lying:— Grim as a wolf, with gleaming fangs, The Frenchman glareth, dying! White is his hair, his features worn With many a wild campaign, He rocks his head from side to side Like to a beast in pain— He groans athirst, with open mouth, Again and yet again. Hans Vogel, in the act to drink And render God due praise, Drops down his fever'd hand in doubt And pauses in amaze, For on the flask that Grenadier Fixeth his thirsty gaze! Hans Vogel smiles, ‘Here lieth one Whose need is more than mine!’ Then, crawling over to his foe, ‘Look, Frenchman, here is wine! And by the God that made us both Shall every drop be thine!’ Hast thou beheld a dying boar, Struck bleeding to the ground, Spring with a last expiring throe To rip the foremost hound? Terrible, fatal, pitiless, It slays with one swift bound. Ev'n so that grizzly wolf of war, With eyes of hate and ire, Stirs as he lies, and on the ground Gropes with a dark desire,— Then lifts a loaded carbine up, And lo! one flash of fire! A flash—a crash! Hans Vogel still Is kneeling on his knee, His heart is beating quick, his face Is pale as man's can be; The ball just grazed his bleeding brow,— ‘Potstausend!’ murmureth he. Hans frowns; and raising to his lips The flask, begins to quaff; Then holds it to the fading light With sly and cynic laugh. Deep is his drought—sweet is the wine— And he hath drunk the half! But now he glanceth once again Where that grim Frenchman lies— Gasping still waits that wolf of war Like to a beast that dies— He groans athirst, with open mouth, And slowly glazing eyes. Hans Vogel smiles; unto his foe Again now totters he— So spent now is that wolf of war He scarce can hear or see. Hans Vogel holds his hand, and takes His head upon his knee! Then down the dying Frenchman's throat He sends the liquor fine: ‘Half yet remains, old boy,’ he cries, While pouring down the wine— ‘Hadst thou not play'd me such a trick, It might have all been thine!’ Hans Vogel speaketh in the tongue Of his good Fatherland— The Frenchman hears an alien sound And cannot understand, But he can taste the warm red wine And feel the kindly hand. See! looking in Hans Vogel's face He stirs his grizzly head— Up, smiling, goes the grim moustache O'er cheeks as grey as lead— With one last glimmer of the eyes, He smiles,—and he is dead. PHIL BLOOD'S LEAP. A TALE OF THE GOLD-SEEKERS. ‘There's some think Injins pison . . .’ [It was Parson Pete who spoke, As we sat there, in the camp-fire glare, like shadows among the smoke. 'Twas the dead of night, and in the light our faces burn'd bright red, And the wind all round made a screeching sound, and the pines roared overhead. Ay, Parson Pete was talking; we called him Parson Pete, For you must learn he'd a talking turn, and handled things so neat; He'd a preaching style, and a winning smile, and, when all talk was spent, Six-shooter had he, and a sharp bowie, to p'int his argyment. Some one had spoke of the Injin folk, and we had a guess, you bet, They might be creeping, while we were sleeping, to catch us in the net; And half were asleep and snoring deep, while the others vigil kept, But devil a one let go his gun, whether he woke or slept.] ‘There's some think Injins pison, and others count 'em scum, And night and day they are melting away, clean into Kingdom Come; But don't you go and make mistakes, like many dern'd fools I've known, For dirt is dirt, and snakes is snakes, but an Injin's flesh and bone! We were seeking gold in the Texan hold, and we'd had a blaze of luck, More rich and rare the stuff ran there at every foot we struck; Like men gone wild we t'iled and t'iled, and never seemed to tire, The hot sun beamed, and our faces streamed with the sweat of a mad desire. I was Captain then of the mining men, and I had a precious life, For a wilder set I never met at derringer and knife; Nigh every day there was some new fray, a bullet in some one's brain, And the viciousest brute to stab and to shoot, was an Imp of Hell from Maine. Phil Blood. Well, he was six foot three, with a squint to make you skeer'd, His face all scabb'd, and twisted and stabb'd, with carroty hair and beard; Sour as the drink in Bitter Chink, sharp as a grizzly's squeal, Limp in one leg, for a leaden egg had nick'd him in the heel. No beauty was he, but a sight to see, all stript to the waist and bare, With his grim-set jaws, and his panther paws, and his hawk's eye all aglare; With pick and spade in sun and shade he labour'd like darnation, But when his spell was over,—well! he was fond of his recreation! And being a crusty kind of cuss, the only sport he had, When work was over, seemed to us a bit too rough and bad; For to put some lead in a comrade's head was the greatest fun in life, And the sharpest joke he was known to poke was the p'int of his precious knife. But game to the bone was Phil, I'll own, and he always fought most fair, With as good a will to be killed as kill, true grit as any there: Of honour too, like me or you, he'd a scent, though not so keen, Would rather be riddled thro' and thro', than do what he thought mean. But his eddication to his ruination had not been over nice, And his stupid skull was choking full of vulgar prejudice; With anything white he'd drink, or he'd fight in fair and open fray; But to murder and kill was his wicked will, if an Injin came his way! ‘A sarpent's hide has pison inside, and an Injin's heart's the same, If he seems your friend for to gain his end, look out for the sarpent's game; Of the snakes that crawl, the worst of all is the snake in a skin of red, A spotted Snake, and no mistake!’ that's what he always said. Well, we'd jest struck our bit of luck, and were wild as raving men, When who should stray to our camp one day, but Black Panther, the Cheyenne; Drest like a Christian, all a-grin, the old one joins our band, And tho' the rest look'd black as sin, he shakes me by the hand. Now, the poor old cuss had been good to us, and I knew that he was true,— I'd have trusted him with life and limb as soon as I'd trust you; For tho' his wit was gone a bit, and he drank like any fish, His heart was kind, he was well-inclined, as even a white could wish. Food had got low, for we didn't know the run of the hunting-ground, And our hunters were sick, when, jest in the nick, the friend in need was found; For he knew the place like his mother's face (or better, a heap, you'd say, Since she was a squaw of the roaming race, and himself a cast-away). Well, I took the Panther into camp. and the critter was well content, And off with him, on the hunting tramp, next day our hunters went, And I reckon that day and the next we didn't want for food, And only one in the camp looked vext—that Imp of Hell, Phil Blood. Nothing would please his contrairy idees! an Injin made him rile! He didn't speak, but I saw on his cheek a kind of an ugly smile; And I knew his skin was hatching sin, and I kept the Panther apart, For the Injin he was too blind to see the dirt in a white man's heart! Well, one fine day, we a-resting lay at noon-time by the creek, The red sun blazed, and we felt half-dazed, too beat to stir or speak; 'Neath the alder trees we stretched at ease, and we couldn't see the sky, For the lian-flowers in bright blue showers hung through the branches high. It was like the gleam of a fairy-dream, and I felt like earth's first Man, In an Eden bower with the yellow flower of a cactus for a fan; Oranges, peaches, grapes, and figs, cluster'd, ripen'd, and fell, And the cedar scent was pleasant, blent with the soothing 'cacia smell. The squirrels red ran overhead, and I saw the lizards creep, And the woodpecker bright with the chest so white tapt like a sound in sleep; I dreamed and dozed with eyes half-closed, and felt like a three-year child, And, a plantain blade on his brow for a shade, even Phil Blood look'd mild. Well, back, jest then, came our hunting men, with the Panther at their head, Full of his fun was every one, and the Panther's eyes were red, And he skipt about with grin and shout, for he'd had a drop that day, And he twisted and twirled, and squeal'd and skirl'd, in the foolish Injin way. To the waist all bare Phil Blood lay there, with only his knife in his belt, And I saw his bloodshot eyeballs stare, and I knew how fierce he felt,— When the Injin dances with grinning glances around him as he lies, With his painted skin and his monkey grin,—and leers into his eyes! Then before I knew what I should do Phil Blood was on his feet, And the Injin could trace the hate in his face, and his heart began to beat; And, ‘Git out o' the way,’ he heard them say, ‘for he means to hev your life!’ But before he could fly at the warning cry, he saw the flash of the knife. ‘Run, Panther run!’ cried each mother's son, and the Panther took the track; With a wicked glare, like a wounded bear, Phil Blood sprang at his back. Up the side so steep of the cañon deep the poor old critter sped, And the devil's limb ran after him, till they faded overhead. Now, the spot of ground where our luck was found was a queerish place, you'll mark, Jest under the jags of the mountain crags and the precipices dark; Far up on high, close to the sky, the two crags leant together, Leaving a gap, like an open trap, with a gleam of golden weather. A pathway led from the beck's dark bed up to the crags on high, And along that path the Injin fled, fast as a man could fly. Some shots were fired, for I desired to keep the white beast back; But I missed my man, and away he ran on the flying Injin's track. Now all below is thick, you know, with 'cacia, alder, and pine, And the bright shrubs deck the side of the beck, and the lian flowers so fine. For the forest creeps all under the steeps, and feathers the feet of the crags With boughs so thick that your path you pick, like a steamer among the snags. But right above you, the crags, Lord love you! are bare as this here hand, And your eyes you wink at the bright blue chink, as looking up you stand. If a man should pop in that trap at the top, he'd never rest arm or leg, Till neck and crop to the bottom he'd drop—and smash on the stones like an egg! ‘Come back, you cuss! come back to us! and let the critter be!’ I screamed out loud, while the men in a crowd stood grinning at them and me . . . But up they went, and my shots were spent, and at last they disappeared,— One minute more, and we gave a roar, for the Injin had leapt, and cleared! A leap for a deer, not a man, to clear,—and the bloodiest grave below! But the critter was smart and mad with fear, and he went like a bolt from a bow! Close after him came the devil's limb, with his eyes as dark as death, But when he came to the gulch's brim, I reckon he paused for breath! For breath at the brink! but—a white man shrink, when a red had passed so neat? I knew Phil Blood too well to think he'd turn his back dead beat! He takes one run, leaps up in the sun, and bounds from the slippery ledge, And he clears the hole, but—God help his soul! just touches the tother edge! One scrambling fall, one shriek, one call, from the men that stand and stare,— Black in the blue where the sky looks thro', he staggers, dwarf'd up there; The edge he touches, then sinks, and clutches the rock—our eyes grow dim— I turn away—what's that they say?—he's ahanging on to the brim! . . . On the very brink of the fatal chink a ragged shrub there grew, And to that he clung, and in silence swung betwixt us and the blue, And as soon as a man could run I ran the way I'd seen them flee, And I came mad-eyed to the chasm's side, and—what do you think I see? All up? Not quite. Still hanging? Right! But he'd torn away the shrub; With lolling tongue he clutch'd and swung—to what? ay, that's the rub! I saw him glare and dangle in air,—for the empty hole he trode,— Help'd by a pair of hands up there!—The Injin's? Yes, by God! Now, boys, look here! for many a year I've roam'd in this here land— And many a sight both day and night I've seen that I think grand; Over the whole wide world I've been, and I know both things and men, But the biggest sight I've ever seen was the sight I saw jest then. I held my breath—so nigh to death Phil Blood swung hand and limb, And it seem'd to us all that down he'd fall, with the Panther after him, But the Injin at length put out his strength—and another minute past,— —Then safe and sound to the solid ground he drew Phil Blood, at last!! Saved? True for you! By an Injin too!—and the man he meant to kill! There all alone, on the brink of stone, I see them standing still; Phil Blood gone white, with the struggle and fright, like a great mad bull at bay, And the Injin meanwhile, with a half-skeer'd smile, ready to spring away. What did Phil do? Well, I watched the two, and I saw Phil Blood turn back, Bend over the brink and take a blink right down the chasm black, Then stooping low for a moment or so, he sheath'd his bowie bright, Spat slowly down, and watch'd with a frown, as the spittle sank from sight! Hands in his pockets, eyes downcast, silent, thoughtful, and grim, While the Panther, grinning as he passed, still kept his eyes on him, Phil Blood strolled slow to his mates below, down by the mountain track, With his lips set tight and his face all white, and the Panther at his back. I reckon they stared when the two appeared! but never a word Phil spoke, Some of them laughed and others jeered,—but he let them have their joke; He seemed amazed, like a man gone dazed, the sun in his eyes too bright, And for many a week, in spite of their cheek, he never offered to fight. And after that day he changed his play, and kept a civiller tongue, And whenever an Injin came that way, his contrairy head he hung; But whenever he heard the lying word, ‘It's a Lie!’ Phil Blood would groan; ‘A Snake is a Snake, make no mistake! but an Injin's flesh and bone!’ THE FAËRY REAPER. IRELAND. 'Tis on Eilanowen, There's laughter nightly! For the Fays are sowing Their golden grain: It springs by moonlight So stilly and brightly, And it drinks no sunlight, Or silver rain;— Tho' the shoots upcreeping No man may see, When men are reaping It reapt must be; But to reap it rightly, With sickle keen, They must lead there nightly A pure colleen! Yes, pure completely Must be that maiden, Just feeling sweetly Her love's first dream. Should one steal thither With evil laden, The crop would wither In the pale moon's beam! For midnights seven, While all men sleep, 'Neath the silent heaven The maid must reap; And the sweeter and whiter Of soul is she, The better and brighter Will that harvest be! . . . In Lough Bawn's bosom The isle is lying, Like a bright green blossom On a maiden's breast— There the water-eagle The osprey (Pandion). O'erhead is flying, And beneath the sea-gull Doth build its nest. And across the water A farm gleams fair, And the farmer's daughter Dwelt lonely there:— And on Eilanowen She'd sit and sing, When the Fays were sowing Their seeds in spring, She could not hear them, Nor see them peeping; Tho' she wandered near them The spring-tide thro', When the grouse was crowing, The trout was leaping, And with hare-bells blowing The banks were blue. But not by moonlight She dared to stay, Only by sunlight She went that way. And on Eilanowen They walked each night, Her footprints sowing With lilies white! When the sun above her Was brightly blazing, She'd bare (God love her!) Each round white limb. Unseen, unnoted, Save fay-folk gazing, Dark hair'd, white throated, She'd strip to swim! Out yonder blushing A space she'd stand, Then falter flushing Across the strand,— Till the bright still water Would sparkle sweet, As it kissed and caught her From neck to feet! There, sparkling round her With fond caresses, It clasp'd her, crowned her, My maiden fair! Then, brighter glowing From its crystal kisses, The bright drops flowing From her dripping hair, Outleaping, running Beneath the sky, The bright light sunning Her limbs, she'd fly,— And 'mid tinkling laughter Of elfin bowers, The Fays ran after With leaves and flowers! Could the Fays behold her, Nor long to gain her? From foot to shoulder None pure as she! They cried ‘God keep her, No sorrow stain her! The Faëry Reaper In troth she'll be!’ . . . With stalks of amber And silvern ears, From earth's dark chamber The grain appears. 'Tis harvest weather! The moon swims high! And they flock together With elfin cry! Now, long and truly I'd loved that maiden; And served her duly With kiss and sign; And that same season My soul love-laden Had found new reason To wish her mine. For her cheek grew paler, Her laughter less, And what might ail her I could not guess. Each harvest morrow We kissing met, And with weary sorrow Her eyes seem'd wet. ‘Oh, speak, Mavourneen, What ails ye nightly? For sure each morning 'Tis sad ye seem!’ Her eyes not weeping Looked on me brightly:— ‘Each night when sleeping I dream a Dream. 'Tis on Eilanowen I seem to be And bright grain growing I surely see; A golden sickle My fingers keep, And my slow tears trickle On what I reap! ‘The moon is gleaming, The faëries gather, Like glow-worms gleaming, Their eyes flash quick; I try while reaping To name “Our Father!” But round me leaping They pinch and prick— On the stalks of amber, On the silvern ears, They cling, they clamber, Till day appears! And here I'm waking In bed, once more, My bones all aching, My heart full sore!’ I kissed her, crying ‘God bless your reaping! For sure no sighing Can set you free. They'll bless your wedding Who vex your sleeping; So do their bidding, Ma cushla chree! But oh, remember! Your fate is cast, And ere December Hath fairly past, The Faëry Reaper Must be a Bride, Or a sad cold sleepe. On the green hill-side!’ ‘Sure wedding's better Than dying sadly!’ She smiled, and set her Soft hand in mine. For three nights after She labour'd gladly, 'Mid fairy laughter, And did not pine; And when the seven Long nights were run, Full well 'neath Heaven That work was done: Their sheaves were slanted, Their harvest made, And no more they wanted A mortal's aid. 'Tis on Eilanowen There's laughter nightly, When the Fays are sowing Their golden grain! God bless that laughter; That grain blow brightly! For luck came after My Mary's pain. And when sweet Mary Was wed to me, Sure the folk of faëry Were there to see:— The white board spreading, Unheard, unseen, They blest the wedding Of a pure colleen! THE ‘MIDIAN-MARA.’ Anglicè, ‘The Mermaid.’ I There's a sad sea-maiden Sighs day and night; For lack of Eden Her eyes weep sore; If you come upon her By pale moonlight,— Farewell to honour For evermore! Tho' her hair is redder Than blood fresh spilt, 'Tis you must wed her And share her guilt; 'Tis you, more pity! Must buried be In her shining City Beneath the Sea. II But shouldest thou view her When shines the sun, And softly unto her On tiptoe creep, You'll find her dozing As I have done, Naked reposing In a sunny sleep; Then be quickly ready To seize her hair, And to name Our Lady As she wakens there; And tho' clouds may thunder O'er the waters wide, To the walls of wonder She'll be your guide. III In the year of hunger, The year of Irish famine. That's long gone by, When I was younger Who now am old, By the Ocean dreary Like a taisch Ghost or spirit. went I, Thin, weak and weary, With want and cold. O sweetly gleaming Was the Sea that hour, And the sun was streaming Thro' a golden shower; As I wandered sighing For the famished Land, I beheld her lying On the yellow strand! IV Like the silver shining Was the Maiden's skin, The red locks twining To the breasts of white, Her cheeks were hueless And chill and thin, Her lips were dewless, But her eyes were bright. Behind her creeping I held her hair,— As she scream'd upleaping I said the prayer;— ‘O Midian-Mara! I hold thee mine: Thy help I borrow, By the Cross's sign!’ V Hast thou ever noted A wounded seal, As it bleats shrill-throated Before it dies? As a seal's eyes turning On them that kill, With a dying yearning, Were the maiden's eyes. With those orbs of azure She gazed on me:— ‘O what's thy pleasure, Gilli ma chree?’ And her tears fell brightly Upon the sands, As she trembled whitely With wringing hands. VI ‘O take me straightway,’ To her said I, ‘To the City's gateway That well ye know— 'Tis the hunger kills me, And that's no lie, And a longing fills me From earth to go.’ She ceased her crying, And sadly said, With the white gulls flying Above her head, ‘Is it there, mavourneen, Ye'd wish to stand, That were bred and born in A Christian land?’ VII I knew her nature Was sly and deep, Tho' the wicked creature Had a heavenly face; And I looked below me At the waves asleep, As I answered, ‘Show me That very place! 'Tis You must charm me To take the track, And no hand shall harm me Till I come back.’ As I spake, deep thunder Was heard that day, And I saw, far under, Where the City lay! VIII 'Neath the green still ocean, Far, far, below, With a mystic motion That can't be told, I saw it gleaming On a strand of snow, Its bright towers beaming, All glass and gold! And a sound thrilled thro' me Like the sound of bells, Upwafted to me On the ocean swells; And I saw far under, Within those same, White shapes of wonder That went and came! IX ‘O Mary, mother, That savest me, 'Tis the place, no other, Where I would go; For 'tis sweet and pleasant, Set 'neath the Sea In the bright white crescent Of the strand below. 'Tis the hunger in me That works its will, Lest the devil win me To steal or kill.’ I held her tighter, And prayed anew:— As I spoke, still brighter That vision grew. X Still glassy and shining Those walls of flame, With the sea-weeds twining Around their feet; More large the place's Great towers became, Till I saw the faces In the golden street. I saw and knew them (The Lord's my guide!) As the water drew them From side to side; I saw the creatures, And I knew them then— The wool—white features Of drownëd men! XI Upright they drifted, All wet and cold, By the sea-wash lifted Like the red sea-tang, While in wild sad cadence, From the towers of gold, The pale sea-maidens Struck harps and sang ‘O shule, shule, O shule, aroon!’ ‘Come, come, my darling, come!’ I tell thee truly, I heard them croon; Then I heard that thunder Roll deep once more, And I swooned for wonder On the yellow shore! XII When I raised in sorrow My fearful face, The Midian-Mara Was fled from me; Without repining I left the place, As the Moon rose shining Beyond the sea. And my feet went faster To see her light, For I feared disaster If I stayed that night . . . When God took pity, And brought me bread, I forgot that City Of the drownëd dead. O'CONNOR'S WAKE. AN IRISH FIDDLE TUNE. To the wake of O'Connor What boy wouldn't go? To do him that honour Went lofty and low. Two nights was the waking, Till day began breaking, And frolics past spaking, To please him, were done; For himself in the middle, With stick and with fiddle, Stretch'd out at his ease, was the King of the Fun. With a dimity curtain overhead, And the corpse-lights shining round his bed, Holding his fiddle and stick, and drest Top to toe in his Sunday best, For all the world he seem'd to be Playing on his back to the companie. On each of his sides was the candle-light; On his legs the tobacco-pipes were piled; Cleanly wash'd, in a shirt of white, His grey hair brush'd, his beard trimm'd right, He lay in the midst of his friends, and smiled. At birth and bedding, at fair and feast, Welcome as light or the smile of the priest, Ninety winters up and down O'Connor had fiddled in country and town. Never a fiddler was clever as he At dance or jig or pater-o'-pee; The sound of his fiddle no word could paint— 'Twould fright the devil or please a saint, Or bring the heart, with a single skirl, To the very mouth of a boy or girl. He played—and his elbow was never done; He drank—and his lips were never dry; Ninety winters his life had run, But God's above, and we all must die. As she stretch'd him out, quoth Judy O'Roon— ‘Sure life's like his music, and ended soon— There's dancing and crying, There's kissing, there's sighing, There's smiling and sporting, There's wedding and courting,— But the skirl of the wake is the end of the tune!’ ‘Shin suas, O'Connor,’ ‘Play up, O'Connor!’ Cried Kitty O'Bride— Her best gown upon her, Tim Bourke by her side— All laughed out to hear her, While Tim he crept near her, To kiss her and cheer her At the back o' the door; But the corpse in the middle, With stick and with fiddle, All done with diversion, would never play more! On the threshold, as each man entered there, He knelt on his knee and said a prayer, But first before he took his seat Among the company there that night, He lifted a pipe from O'Connor's feet, And lit it up by the bright corpse-light. Chattering there in the cloud of smoke, They waked him well with song and joke; The gray old men and the cauliaghs Old women. told Of all his doings in days of old; The boys and girls till night was done, Played their frolics and took their fun, And many a kiss was stolen sure Under the window and behind the door. Andy Hagan and Kitty Delane Hid in a corner and courted there, ‘Monamondioul!’ cried old Tim Blane, Pointing them out, ‘they're a purty pair!’ But when they blushed and hung the head, ‘Troth, never be shamed!’ the old man said; ‘Sure love's as short as the flowers in June, And life's like music, and ended soon— There's wooing and wedding, There's birth and there's bedding, There's grief and there's pleasure To fill up the measure,— But the skirl of the wake is the end of the tune!’ At the wake of O'Connor Great matches were made, To do him more honour We joked and we played— Two nights was the waking, Till day began breaking, The cabin was shaking Before we were done, And himself in the middle, With stick and with fiddle, As large as in life, was the King of the Fun! ‘Well, I remember,’ said Tony Carduff, Drawing the pipe from his lips with a puff, ‘Well, I remember at Ballyslo’,— And troth and it's thirty years ago,— In the midst of the fair there fell a fight, And who but O'Connor was in the middle? Striking and crying with all his might, And with what for weapon? the ould black fiddle! That day would have ended its music straight If it hadn't been strong as an iron pot; Tho' the blood was on it from many a pate, Troth, divil a bit of harm it got!’ Cried Michael na Chauliuy, ‘Michael the Ferryman;’ lit. ‘belonging to the ferry.’ ‘And troth that's true— Himself and the fiddle were matched by few. They went together thro' every weather, Full of diversion and tough as leather,— I thought he'd never think of dying, But Jesus keep us!—there's he's lying.’ Then the cauliaghs squatting round on the floor Began to keenagh To cry, as during the coronach at a funeral. and sob full sore; ‘God be good to the ould gossoon! Sure life's like music, and ended soon. There's playing and plighting, There's frolic and fighting, There's singing and sighing, There's laughing and crying,— But the skirl of the wake is the end of the tune!’ At the wake of O'Connor, The merry old man, To wail in his honour The cauliaghs began; And Rose, Donnell's daughter From over the water, Began (sure saints taught her!) The sweet drimindhu; A melancholy ditty. All was still;—in the middle, With stick and with fiddle, O'Connor, stretched silent, seem'd hearkening too! Oh, 'twas sweet as the crooning of fairies by night, Oh, 'twas sad,—as you listened, you smiled in delight, With the tears in your eyes; it was like a shower falling, When the rainbow shines thro' and the cuckoo is calling; You might feel through it all, as the sweet notes were given, The peace of the Earth and the promise of Heaven! In the midst of it all the sweet singer did stand, With a light on her hair, like the gleam of a hand; She seem'd like an angel to each girl and boy, But most to Tim Cregan, who watch'd her in joy, And when she had ended he led her away, And whisper'd his love till the dawning of day. After that, cried Pat Rooney, the rogue of a lad, ‘I'll sing something merry—the last was too sad!’ And he struck up the song of the Piper of Clare. How the bags of his pipes were beginning to tear, And how, when the cracks threaten'd fairly to end them, He cut up his own leather breeches to mend them! How we laugh'd, young and old! ‘Well, beat that if you can,’ Cried fat Tony Bourke, the potheen-making man— ‘Who sings next?’ Tony cried, and at that who came in, Dancing this way and that way in midst of the din, But poor Shamus the Fool? and he gave a great spring— ‘By the cross, merry boys, 'tis mysilf that can sing!’ Then he stood by the corpse, and he folded his hands, And he sang of the sea and the foam on the sands, Of the shining skiddawn Herring. as It flies to and fro, Of the birds of the waves and their wings like the snow. Then he sank his voice lower and sang with strange sound Of the caves down beneath and the beds of the drown'd, Till we wept for the boys who lie where the wave rolls, With no kinsmen to stretch them and wake their poor souls. When he ceased. Shamus looked at the corpse, and he said, ‘Sure a dacenter man never died in his bed!’ And at that the old cauliaghs began to croon: ‘Sure life's like his music, and ended as soon— There's dancing and sporting, There's kissing and courting, There's grief and there's pleasure To fill up the measure,— But the skirl of the wake is the end of the tune.’ ‘A health to O'Connor!’ Fat Anthony said: ‘We'll drink in the honour Of him that is dead.’ A two-gallon cag, then, Did Anthony drag then From out his old bag then, While all there grew keen. 'Twas sweet, strong, and filling— His own best distilling! Oh, well had the dead man loved Tony's potheen! Whisky, illicitly distilled Then the fun brightened up; but of all that befell It would take me a long day in summer to tell— Of the dancing and singing, the leaping and sporting, And sweetest of all, the sly kissing and courting! Two nights was the waking; two long winter nights O'Connor lay smiling in mídst of the lights. In the cloud of the smoke like a cloud of the skies, The blessing upon him, to close his old eyes. Oh, when the time comes for myself to depart, May I die full of days like the merry old man! I'll be willing to go with the peace on my heart, Contented and happy, since life's but a span; And O may I have, when my lips cease to spake, To help my poor soul, such an elegant wake! The country all there, friends and kinsmen and all, And myself in the middle, with candle and pall! . . . Came the dawn, and we put old O'Connor to rest, In his coffin of wood, with his hands on his breast, And we followed him all by the hundred and more,— The boys all in black, and his friends sighing sore. We left him in peace, the poor sleeping gossoon, Thinking, ‘Life's like his music, and ended too soon. There's laughing and sporting, There's kissing and courting, There's grief and there's pleasure To fill up the measure,— But the wake and the grave are the end of the tune!’ ‘Good-bye to O'Connor,’ Cried Barnaby Blake, ‘May the saints do him honour For the ould fiddle's sake! If the saints love sweet playing— It's the thruth that I'm saying— His sowl will be straying And fiddling an air! He'll pass through their middle, With stick and with fiddle, And they'll give him the cead mile fealta ‘Hundred thousand welcomes.’ up there!’ Note.—The preceding Poem is a literal description of a wake in the wildest and loneliest part of Connaught. Several of the characters—e.g. Shamus the Fool—are well known to the mountaineers and fishermen of that untrodden district, where the old Celtic tongue is still spoken in its purity and the old Celtic customs are still practised, and where the author, in almost complete seclusion, passed four happy years. HIGHLAND LAMENT. ‘O mar tha mi! 'tis the wind that's blowing, O mar tha mi! 'tis the sea that's white! 'Tis my own brave boatman was up and going, From Uist to Barra at dead of night; Body of black and wings of red His boat went out on the stormy sea. O mar tha mi! can I sleep in my bed? O gillie dubh! come back to me! ‘O mar tha mi! is it weed out yonder? Is it drifting weed or a tangled sail? On the shore I wait and watch and wander. It's calm this day, after last night's gale. O this is the skiff with wings so red, And it floats upturned on the glassy sea O mar tha mi! is my boatman dead? O gillie dubh! come back to me! ‘O mar tha mi! 'tis a corpse that's sleeping, Floating there on the slippery sands; His face is drawn and his locks are dreeping, His arms are stiff and he's clench'd his hands. Turn him up on his slimy bed, Clean his face from the weed o' the sea. O mar tha mi! 'tis my boatman dead! O gillie dubh! won't you look at me? ‘O mar tha mi! 'tis my love that's taken! O mar tha mi! I am left forlorn! He'll never kiss and he'll never waken, He'll never look on the babe unborn. His blood is water, his heart is lead, He's dead and slain by the cruel sea. O mar tha mi! I am lone in my bed, My gillie dubh is lost to me!’ JAMES AVERY. At Portsmouth, in a tavern dark, One day of windy weather, A crew of reckless sailors sat, And drank their grog together. Loud was the talk, and rude the joke, So deep the jovial din They did not mark a lean, wild shape Who shivering enter'd in: A beggar wight, who hugg'd his rags, And chatter'd with the cold; Lean was his shape, his eyeballs dim, Wrinkled his cheek, and old. In a dark corner of the room He sat with sorry cheer, Not list'ning, till a word, a name, Fell on his frozen ear. ‘James Avery!’ and as he spake One pointed thro' the pane At a great playbill on the wall Of the damp and oozy lane. On the dead wall the letters great Made tempting bright display: James Avery, the Pirate King, Was posted that night's play. ‘Ay!’ cried a tar, reading aloud, ‘Well might they call him so! The Pirate King—I grudge his luck!’ Then, with an oath, ‘I'll go.’ Another cried, ‘Ah, that's the life To suit a sailor's style! Ben Conway saw his palace, mates, On Madagascar Isle; ‘And on a throne, in red and gold, Jem sat like any king, With dark-eyed donnas all around, As fresh as flowers in spring! ‘They brought him wine in cups of gold, And each knelt on her knee— Each mother-naked, smooth as silk— Ah, that's the life for me!’ Then spake a third, ‘I sailed with Jem On board the “Hurricane”; When he deserted I ne'er thought To hear of him again. ‘And now it's long since last I heard His name, and p'raps he's dead.’ ‘Not so; he only takes a nap!’ A grizzly war's-man said. ‘He has a fleet of fighting ships, Swifter than ours tenfold; Last spring he took six Indiamen, Laden with gems and gold. ‘There's not a corner of the main But knows the skull and bones— Up goes the flag! and down comes Jem, As sure as Davy Jones. ‘But let him have his fling; some day We'll catch him at his trade— Short shrift! a rope! and up he goes, And all his pranks are played.’ All laughed; ‘But not so fast,’ cried one; ‘It's not too late, I vow; His Majesty would pardon him, If he'd surrender now. ‘The pardon's in the newspapers, In black and white it's there; If pirate Jem will cease his games, They'll spare his life, they swear All laugh'd again—‘Jem's wide awake— You don't catch birds with chaff— Come back to biscuit and salt junk? He is too 'cute by half. ‘Leave all his gold and precious stones, His kingdom, and all that, Bid all them dark-eyed girls farewell For labour,—and the cat?’ Ev'n as they speak, a wretched form Springs up before their eyes. ‘Give me the paper! let me read!’ The famished creature cries. They thrust him back with jeer and laugh, So wild and strange is he. . . . ‘Why, who's this skeleton?’ . . . A voice Answers, ‘James Avery!’ Louder they laugh—‘He's mad! he's mad!’ They round him in a ring. ‘Jem here in rags! no, he's in luck, As grand as any king!’ But soon he proves his story true With eager words and tones; Then, as he ends, ‘Bread, give me bread! I'm starving, mates!’ he moans. ‘Nay, drink!’ they cry; and his lean hands Clutch at the fiery cup. ‘Here's to the King who pardons me!’ He cries, and drinks it up. He tells them of his weary days Since that dark hour he fled, A hunted thing, without a home Wherein to lay his head. Through some mysterious freak of fate, His name abroad was spread, And not a wondrous deed was done But that wild name was said; And all the time James Avery dwelt An outcast, gaunt and grim, Till creeping home that day he heard His King had pardoned him. The wild drink mounted to his brain, He revell'd maniac-eyed, ‘Come to the playhouse—'twill be sport To see thyself!’ they cried. Between them, down the narrow street They led his scarecrow form— The wind blew chill from off the sea, Before the rising storm. They sat and saw the mimic play, Till late into the night:— The happy Pirate, crown'd with gold, And clad in raiment bright. The actor swagger'd on the stage And drank of glorious cheer, . . . James Avery gazed! his hungry laugh Was pitiful to hear! They parted. . . . As the chill white dawn Struck down a lonely lane, It flashed upon the rainy wall And made the play-bill plain. James Avery, the Pirate King! The mocking record said— Beneath, James Avery's famish'd form Lay ragged, cold, and dead! THE DEVIL'S PEEPSHOW. OLD STYLE. As thro' the Town of Vanity I trod, I heard one calling in the name of God, And turning I beheld a wan-eyed wight, Clad in a garment that had once been bright, Who, while a few pale children gathered round, Did plant his faded Peepshow on the ground. Trembling the children|peep'd; and lingering nigh, E'en thus I heard the ragged Showman cry:— I. Now first your eye will here descry How all the world begun: The earth green-dight, the ocean bright, The moon, the stars, the sun. All yet is dark; but you will mark, While round this sphere is spun, A Hand so bare moves here and there, Whence rays of ruby run. I pull a string, and everything Is finish'd bright and new, Tho' dim as dream all yet doth seem; And this, God wot, is true. II. Now this, you see, is Eden Tree, In Eden's soil set deep; Beneath it lies with closëd eyes Strong Adam, fast asleep. All round, the scene is gold and green, And silver rivers creep; Him on the grass the wild beasts pass, As mild and tame as sheep. My bell I ring; I pull a string; And on the self-same spot, From Adam's side God takes his Bride; And this is true, God wot. III. There still doth shine the Tree Divine, Flush'd with a purple flame, And hand in hand our parents stand, Naked, but have no shame. Now Adam goes to take repose While musing sits his Dame; When, over her, the blest boughs stir, To show how Satan came. A Snake so bright, with horns of light, Green leaves he rustles thro', Fair Eve descries with wondering eyes; And this, God wot, is true. IV. Now pray perceive, how over Eve The fruits forbidden grow. With hissing sound the Snake twines round, His eyes like rubies glow. ‘Fair Eve,’ he says (in those old days Snakes spoke) and louteth low, ‘This fruit you see upon the Tree Shall make you see and know. . . .’ My bell I ring; I pull a string; And on the self-same spot Fair Eve doth eat the Fruit so sweet; And this is true, God wot. V. A CHILD. Please, why did He who made the Tree, Our Father in the sky, Let it grow there, so sweet and fair, To tempt our Parents' eye? SHOWMAN. My pretty dear, it is most clear He wish'd their strength to try; And therefore sent, with wise intent, The Serpent swift and sly. I pull a string, and there (poor thing!) Stands Adam eating too! And now, you mark, all groweth dark; And this, God wot, is true. VI. Now, you discern, a voice so stern Cries ‘Adam, where art thou?’ Tis God the Lord, by all adored, Walks there; and all things bow. But with his Bride doth Adam hide His guilty, burning brow; And of fig-leaves each sinner weaves A guilty apron now. My bell I ring; I pull a string; And from that pleasant spot A Sword of Flame drives man and dame; And this is true, God wot. VII. Now wipe the glass. And we will pass To quite another scene: In a strange land two Altars stand, One red, the other green; The one of blood right sweet and good, The other weeds, I ween! And there, full plain, stands frowning Cain, And Abel spruce and clean. I pull a string; and every thing Grows dark and sad anew,— There Abel lies with dying eyes! And this, God wot, is true. VIII. The wicked Cain has Abel slain All with a burning brand; And now, sad sight, an Angel bright Doth mark him with his hand. A CHILD. What specks so red are those that spread Behind them as they stand? SHOWMAN. The sparks you see the wild eyes be, Countless as grains of sand, Of all those men who have, since then. Shed blood in any land! In grief and pain they look at Cain, Aghast on that sad spot; And all around blood soaks the ground; And this is true, God wot. IX. My bell I ring; I pull a string: Now, Father Noah you mark— Sleeping he lies, with heavy eyes, All full of wine, and stark. But now, behold! that good man old A Voice in dream doth hark; And the Voice cries, ‘O Noah, arise! And build thyself an Ark.’ Again I ring; and pull a string; And all is water blue, Where, floating free, the Ark you see; And this, God wot, is true. X. Thus God the Lord, with his great Word, Did bid the waters rise, To drown and kill all things of ill He made beneath the skies. The Lord saved none, but Noah alone, His kith and kin likewise; Two of each beast, both great and least; Two of each bird that flies. My bell I ring; I pull a string; And on the self-same spot, The water sinks, the bright Bow blinks; And this is true, God wot. XI. O day and night, unto your sight Such wonders shown might be, But to conclude this Peepshow good, You Heaven and Hell shall see: The shining things, with spangled wings, Who smile and sing so free; The crew of shame, who in hell-flame Complain eternallie! My bell I ring; I pull a string; And you them both may view— The blest on high, the curst who cry:— And this, Got wot, is true. XII. A CHILD. How can they bear, who sit up there In shining robes so gay, From Heaven to peer, without a tear, On those who scream and pray? SHOWMAN. Why, those who burn had, you must learn, As fair a chance as they— But Adam's fall doth doom them all Upon God's judgment day. I thus conclude with moral good, Not soon to be forgot; And you must own what I have shown Is solemn sooth, Got wot. XIII. A LITTLE BOY. O look at him, that showman grim, A frown is on his cheek; Come away quick, for I am sick Whene'er I hear him speak! A GIRL. Along this way, last Holy Day, In blessëd Whitsun' week, There passed a wight, so sweet and bright He seemed an Angel meek: He bare, also, an old Peep-show, But prettier far to view, And loud cried He ‘O look and see! For all, God wot, is true!’ XIV. CHILDREN. And did you peep? and did you weep To see the pictures wild? GIRL. Ah nay, ah nay, I laughed, full gay, I looked and laughed and smiled! For I discern'd, with bright face turned On mine, a little Child; And round him, bright burn'd many a light, And cakes and sweets were piled; And scents most rare fill'd all the air All round the heavenly spot, While loud and wide that Showman cried— ‘This is our Lord, God wot!’ XV. FIRST CHILD. 'Twas Jesus Child! so good and mild! He grew on Mary's breast! GIRL. Sweet were his eyes, his look was wise, And his red lips were blest; I longed, I wis, those lips to kiss, And by his side to rest. This man's Peepshow is strange, I know, But the other was the best! Now let us go where daisies blow, Sweet ferns, and speedwells blue, And Posies make for Christ His sake, For He is bright and true! XVI. SHOWMAN (solus). Folk, I'm afraid, are changed; my trade Grows worse each day, I know. How they did throng when I was young, To see this very Show! My rivals pass, and lad and lass Follow where'er they go, While up and down, from town to town, I creep, most sad and slow. I too must try some novel cry, Lest I be quite forgot: These pictures old that I unfold Have ceased to please, God wot! DAYBREAK. FRAGMENT. But now the first faint flickering ray Fell from the cold east far away, The birds awoke and twitter'd, hover'd, The dim leaves sparkled in the dew— Earth slowly her dark head uncover'd And held her blind face up the blue, Till the fresh consecration came In yellow beams of orient flame, Touching her, and she breathed full blest With lilies heaving on her breast. Seas sparkled, dark capes glimmer'd green, As Dawn crept on from scene to scene, Lifting each curtain of the night With fingers flashing starry-white. EUPHROSYNE; OR, THE PROSPECT. ‘Freed from its tenement of clay (So the prophetic legend ran), As pure as dew, as bright as day, Shall rise the Soul of Man.’ I read; and in the shade by me Sat golden-haired Euphrosyne. Above our shaded orchard seat The boughs stirred scented in the light. And on the grass beneath our feet Lay blossoms pink and white; I held the book upon my knee, Translating to Euphrosyne. 'Twas an old melancholy rune, Writ by a Norseman long ago— Sad with the sense of stars and moon, Sea-wash, and frost, and snow— A vision of futurity! And wide-eyed heard Euphrosyne. ‘Stately and slow the heart shall beat To the low throb of Time's soft tide, While, shaded from the solar heat, The Shapes walk heavenly-eyed.’ All round us burnt the starry lea, And warmly sighed Euphrosyne. ‘All shall be innocent and fair, Dim as a dream the days shall pass— No weed of shame shall blossom there, No snake crawl on the grass.’— ‘How happy such a world will be!’ Sighed beautiful Euphrosyne. ‘Flesh shall be fled, sense shall be still, The old grey earth buried and dead; The wicked world, with all things ill— Stone, rock, and tree—be fled.’— ‘No earth, no world!’ softly sighed she, The little maid, Euphrosyne. She clasped her hands, she cast her eyes Over the landscape bright with May— Scented and sweet, 'neath cloudless skies, Smiled the green world that day— Loud sang the thrush, low hummed the bee, And softly sighed Euphrosyne. ‘Sickness shall perish, grief and pain Be buried with the buried life; The aching heart, the weary brain, At last shall cease their strife.’— The grey tome trembled on my knee, But happy sat Euphrosyne. ‘The luminous house wherein we dwell, The haunted house of shame and lust, The callow spirit's fleshly shell, Shall crumble into dust; The flower shall fade, the scent fly free!’— She trembled now, Euphrosyne. Her warm, white bosom heaved with sighs, I felt her light breath come and go, She drank, with glorious lips and eyes, The summer's golden glow; She felt her life, and sighed ‘Ay, me!’ The flower of maids, Euphrosyne. ‘And with the flower of flesh shall fade The venom'd bloom of earthly love, No passion-trance of man and maid Shall taint the life above; Flesh shall be fled, sex shall not be!’— I paused, and watched Euphrosyne. Her hands were folded round her knees, Her eyes were fix'd in a half-dream; She shared the flame of flowers and trees, And drank the summer gleam; ‘Kiss sweet, kiss sweet!’ upon the tree The thrush sang, to Euphrosyne. A little maid of seventeen Mays, A happy child with golden hair, What should she know of Love's wild ways, Its hope, its pain, and prayer? ‘No love in heaven?—how strange 'twill be!’ Still musing, sighed Euphrosyne. ‘No thoughts of perishable mould Shall break the rule of heavenly rest, But larger light, more still, more cold, More beautiful and blest.’— Her heart was fluttering close to me, And quickly breathed Euphrosyne. ‘There shall be no more love!’—but here I paused, for from my side she sprang, And in her bird's voice, loud and clear, Of love's young dream she sang— ‘Oh, close the foolish book!’ cried she, The happy maid Euphrosyne. I closed the book, and from my hold She took it with her fingers white, Then down the path of green and gold She tripped with laughter light— ‘The book, not the glad world, shall be Deep-buried,’ said Euphrosyne. Within an elm-tree's hollow bole, Into the darkness damp and green, She thrust it, closing up the hole With sprays of lilac sheen— Then, all the radiant flush of glee Fast faded from Euphrosyne. Pensively in the summer shine Her blue eyes filled with tears of bliss: She held her little mouth to mine In one long heavenly kiss— ‘I love the earth, and life, and thee!’ She whispered, my Euphrosyne. Sleep, Book, within thy burial place, With flowers and fruit for epitaph! Kind Heaven, stoop down thy sunny face To hear the Earth's glad laugh! Smile, with your glorious eyes on me, O child of joy! Euphrosyne! STANLEY FARM. Come, love, and while the landscape glows Red in the setting sun, Let us repair to Stanley Farm, Where thou wast wooed and won. The river runs through a narrow glen, And shooting past the mill, It lingers near the burial-ground Where the dark dead lie still. Then fresh and free it shooteth through The bridge at headlong speed; But when the village bridge is past, It comes to marsh and mead; And broadening out with slacken'd pace, It fringes green flat land, Where, blanchèd white by frequent floods, Long lines of pollards stand. And now within its shallow pools, The blue-winged hern doth wade, Still as a stone, with crooked neck Above his floating shade. And water-lilies fringe the brim, And all is sedge and reed, Save one small stream within the midst, That winds and winds with speed. Then down comes Thornby Beck and gains The river with a cry, And on the two together run, Under the English sky. And strong and deep the stream has grown, As well as broad and wide, On reaching Stanley Farm, that sits Upon the water's side. How still it is! how bright it is, These happy summer weeks, When cattle wade, in the dark blue pools Broken to silvern streaks! But, love, hast thou forgot the Yule, Twenty long years ago? The level meads around the stream Were white with ice and snow. The river was frozen white and blue, In its cold weedy bed; A deep black fog filled all the air, And in the fog, o'erhead, Just hovering close to earth, as small As a school-boy's pink balloon, The wandering sun looked strange and cold As the red wintry moon. The fog was dark, and darkest there Above the river's bed, And from the windows of the farm All day the lights gleamed red. But when the sun's ball rolled from sight, The wind began to blow, The chilly fog was cleft in twain, And the moon lit up the snow! A deep blue flower with a golden heart Hung downwards, was the sky, And white and cold in swathes of snow Did mead and hamlet lie. And ever and anon the wind Blew up a cloud so pale, And held it o'er the yellow moon, Like a thin lawny veil. And through its folds the bright'ning morn Gazed, breathing soft and slow, Till, melted with her breath, the cloud Was shriven into snow. Then ever in the bright'ning beam, As each soft cloud stole by, We saw dark figures on the stream Gliding with merry cry. Men and maidens, old and young, The skaters frolicked there; Like shapes within a dream, their forms Stole through the mystic air. ON A YOUNG POETESS'S GRAVE. Under her gentle seeing, In her delicate little hand, They placed the Book of Being, To read and understand. The Book was mighty Yea, worn and eaten with age; Though the letters looked great and golden She could not read a page. The letters fluttered before her, And all looked darkly wild: Death saw her, and bent o'er her, As she pouted her lips and smiled. Then, weary a little with tracing The Book, she look'd aside, And lightly smiling, and placing A Flower in its leaves, she died. She died, but her sweetness fled not, As fly the things of power,— For the Book wherein she read not Is the sweeter for the Flower. LOVE IN WINTER. A GENRE PICTURE. I. ‘O Love is like the roses, And every rose shall fall, For sure as summer closes They perish one and all. Then love, while leaves are on the tree, And birds sing in the bowers: When winter comes, too late 'twill be To pluck the happy flowers.’ It is a maiden singing, An ancient girl, in sooth; The dizzy room is ringing With her shrill song of youth; The white keys sob as fast she tries Each shrill and shricking scale: ‘O love is like the roses!’ cries This muslin'd nightingale. . . . In a dark corner dozing I close my eyes and ears, And call up, while reposing, A glimpse from other years; A genre-picture, quaint and Dutch, I see from this dark seat,— 'Tis full of human brightness, such As makes remembrance sweet. II. Flat leagues of endless meadows [In Holland lies the scene], Where many pollard-shadows O'er nut-brown ditches lean; Grey clouds above that dimly break, Mists that pale sunbeams stripe, With groups of steaming cattle, make A landscape ‘after Cuyp.’ A windmill, and below it A cottage near a road, Where some meek pastoral poet Might make a glad abode; A cottage with a garden, where Prim squares of pansies grow, And sitting on a garden-chair, A Dame with locks of snow. In trim black truss'd and bodiced, With petticoat of red, And on her bosom modest A kerchief white bespread. Alas! the breast that heaves below Is shrivell'd now and thin, Tho' vestal thoughts as white as snow Still palpitate within. Her hands are mitten'd nicely, And folded on her knee; Her lips, that meet precisely, Are moving quietly. She listens while the dreamy bells O'er the dark flats intone— Now come, now gone, in dying swells The Sabbath sounds are blown. Her cheek a withered rose is, Her eye a violet dim; Half in her chair she doses, And hums a happy hymn. But soft! what wonder makes her start And lift her aged head, While the faint flutterings of her heart Just touch her cheek with red? The latch clicks; thro' the gateway An aged wight steps slow— Then pauses, doffing straightway His broad-brim'd gay chapeau! Swallow-tail'd cot of blue so grand, With buttons bright beside, He wears, and in his trembling hand A nosegay, ribbon-tied. His thin old legs trip lightly In breeches of nankeen, His face is shining brightly, So rosy, fresh, and clean— Wrinkled he is and old and plain, With locks of golden-grey, And leaning on a tassell'd cane He gladly comes this way. Oh, skylark, singing over The silent mill hard by, To this so happy lover Sing out with summer cry! He hears thee, tho' his blood is cold, She hears, tho' deaf and weak; She stands to greet him, as of old, A blush upon her cheek. In spring-time they were parted By some sad wind of woe; Forlorn and broken-hearted Each faltered, long ago; They sunder'd,—half a century Each took the path of pain— He lived a bachelor, and she Was never woo'd again! But when the summer ended, When autumn, too, was dead, When every vision splendid Of youth and hope was fled, Again these two came face to face As in the long ago— They met within a sunless place In the season of the snow. ‘O love is like the roses, Love comes and love must flee! Before the summer closes Love's rapture and love's glee!’ O peace! for in the garden there He bows in raiment gay; Doffs hat, and with a courtly air Presents his fond bouquet. One day in every seven, While church-bells softly ring, The happy, silent Heaven Beholds the self-same thing: The gay old boy within the gate, With ribbons at his knee!— ‘When winter comes, is love too late?’ O Cupid, look and see! O, talk not of love's rapture, When youthful lovers kiss; What mortal sight may capture A scene more sweet than this? Beside her now he sits and glows, While prim she sits and proud,— Then, spectacles upon his nose, Reads the week's news aloud! Pure, with no touch of passion, True, with no tinge of pain! Thus, in sweet Sabbath fashion, They live their loves again. She sees in him a happy boy— Swift, agile, amorous-eyed; He sees in her his own heart's joy— Youth, Hope, Love, vivified! Content there he sits smoking His long Dutch pipe of wood: Gossiping oft and joking, As a gay lover should. And oft, while there in company They smile for Love's sweet sake, Her snuff-box black she hands, and he A grave, deep pinch doth take! There, gravely juvenescent, In sober Sabbath joy, Mingling the past and present, They sit, a maid and boy! ‘O love is like the roses!’—No! Thou foolish singer, cease! Love finds the fireside 'mid the snow, And smokes the pipe of peace! WILL O' THE WISP. A BALLAD WRITTEN FOR CLARI, ON A STORMY NIGHT. Just an inch high With a body all yellow, A bright crimson eye And limbs all awry, Wakes the queer little fellow— Yes, awakes in the night, Rubs his eyes in a fright, Yawns, harks to the thunder, While the glowworms all set Round his cradle so wet, Stare at him in wonder. How it blows! how it rains! How the thunder refrains! While the glowworms so wan, As they gather together, Hear the quaint little man Squeak faintly, ‘What weather!’ ‘Who is his father? Who is his mother?’ They cry as they gather, And puzzle, and pother— Such a queer little chap, Just new-born in a nap! And such antics are his As he springs on his bed, Such a comical phiz, Such a red, Shining head! Hark again, 'Midst the rain How the deep thunder crashes! And the lightning Is bright'ning In fitful blue flashes! ‘Here's fun! here's a din!’ Cries Will with a grin— ‘I'll join in the play— It's darker than pitch In this hole of a ditch, What a place to be born in—I'm off and away.’ Out on the heath It rains with a will. The Wind sets his teeth And whistles right shrill All is darkness and sound, All is splishing and splashing; The pools on the ground Glimmer wet in the flashing— Up and down, round and round, With a leap and a bound. Goes the little one dashing. ‘Oh what fun!’ out he screams At the wild blue beams As they flicker and pass. Then he squats down and seems With his nose's red gleams Like a lamp in the grass;— Then 'mid rain washing down, and the thunder still busy, He flies spinning round, till he pauses, half dizzy. How dark and how still, In the arm of the hill, Lies the hamlet asleep— While the wind is so shrill, And the darkness so deep! Down the street all is dark, And closed is each shutter; But he pauses to mark, His face like a spark In the black polished gutter! But see! what a streak Gleams out from the inn! Overhead with a creak, And a groan and a squeak, Shakes the sign; while the din Comes harsh from within. Hark!—the jingling of glasses, The singers' refrain! Will stops as he passes And peeps through the pane, Dripping, slippery with rain, There they sit and they joke, In the grey cloud of smoke, While the jolly old host, With his back to the fire, Stands warm as a toast, And doth smile and perspire. Grave, thin, and pedantic, The schoolmaster sits, While, in argument frantic With riotous wits, The maker of boots Still in apron of leather, Thumps the board and disputes, Contradicts and refutes; And like sparrows collected, all birds of a feather, All smoking long pipes, and all nodding together, The Wiseacres gather, screen'd snug from the weather. Great, broad, and brown, Stands the jug on the board, And the ale is poured, And they quaff it down. How it froths, fresh and strong, Warm, sweet, full of spice! Will's beginning to long For a sip,—'tis so nice! So he whispers the Wind, Who runs round from the lane, And they creep in behind, And the Wind tries to find An entrance in vain. Then ‘The Chimney!’ cries Will, While the Wind laughs out shrill, And he leaps at one bound To the roof up on high, While the chimneys all round Tremble and cry. One moment he pauses Up yonder, and draws his Breath deep and strong, Then dives like a snake, While the dwelling doth quake, To the room where they throng. Ho, ho! with one blow Out the lights go, Dark and silent is all. But the fire burns low With its ghost on the wall. ‘What a night! Ah, here's weather!’ All murmur together With voices sunk low, While softly slips Will In the jug, drinks his fill, And is turning to go, When a hand, while none mark, Lifts the jug in the dark; 'Tis the cobbler so dry Seeks to drink on the sly! Tarala! pirouette! Will springs at his nose, The jug is upset, And the liquor o'erflows. ‘What's that?’ all exclaim, Leaping up with a shout, While the cobbler in shame, With nose all aflame, Cries, ‘The Devil, no doubt!’ And as fresh lights are brought These birds of a feather Think it quite a new thought To nod gravely together, Crying hot and distraught, ‘Well, indeed! this is weather!’ Tarala! pirouette! Out again in the wet! Like a small dancing spark, With his face flashing bright In the black dripping dark, Goes the elf of the night. Hark! from the church-tower, Slowly chimeth the hour! Twelve times low and deep, Comes the chime through the shower On the village asleep;— And where ivies enfold The belfry, doth sit, Huddled up from the cold, The owl grey and old, With ‘Toowhoo’ and ‘Tcowhit!’ ‘Heigho!’—yawns poor Will— ‘Time for bed, by the powers!’ And he lights on a sill, Among flower-pots and flowers, And just as he seems To slumber inclined, A white hand forth-gleams From within, and the blind Is drawn back, and oh dear! What a beautiful sight! Clari's face doth appear Looking out at the night. And Clari doth stand, With the lamp in her hand, In her bedgown of white— Her hair runs like gold on her shoulders, and fills With gleams of gold-shadow her tucks and her frills, And her face is as sweet as a star, and below Her toes are like rosebuds that peep among snow. Breathless with wonder, Quiet and still, He crouches under The pots on the sill; Then the blind closes slow, And the vision doth fade, But still to and fro On the blind moves the shade— There! out goes the light! Will lifts up his head, All is darker than night, She is creeping to bed. Oh, light be her rest! She steals into her nest, Without a beholder, And the bed, soft and warm, Swells up round her form To receive and enfold her! [The wind is increasing, But the rain is ceasing, And blown up from the west Comes the moon wan and high, With a cloud on her crest, And a tear in her eye. Distraught and opprest, She drifts wearily by!] ‘Heigho!’ yawns poor Will— Still crouch'd down on the sill— ‘How sleepy I feel! There's a cranny up there To let in the fresh air,— Here goes! in I'll steal!’ So said and so done, And he enters the room Where the dainty-limb'd one, like a lily in bloom, Her face a dim brightness, her breath a perfume, Sleeps softly. With noiseless invisible tread The wanderer steals to the side of the bed Where she lies, oh how fair! so sweet and so warm, While the white clothes sink round the soft mould of her form; One hand props her cheek, and one unespied Lies rising and falling upon her soft side. Will floats to and fro, and the light that he throws Just lights this or that as she lies in repose, Leaving all the rest dark. See! he hops 'mong her hair And shines like a jewel;—then leans down to stare In her face,—and his ray as he trembles and spies Just flashes against the white lids of her eyes;— While her breath—oh her breath is so sweet and so fine, Will drinks and turns dizzy—his joy is divine, And his light flashing down shows the red lips apart, To free the deep fragrance that steals from her heart Just an inch high, With a body all yellow, A bright crimson eye, And limbs all awry, Stands the queer little fellow! And Clari's sweet mouth Just a little asunder, Sweet with spice from the South, Fills his spirit with wonder: Such a warm little mouth! Such a red little mouth! The thin bud above and the plump blossom under! ‘Heigho, heart's alive! Here's a door, here I'll rest!’ And he takes one quick dive And slips into her breast! And there may he thrive Like a bird in a nest! And Clari turns over And flushes and sighs, Pushes back the warm cover, Half opens her eyes, Then sinking again Warm, languid, and bright, With new bliss in her brain, Dreams—such dreams—of delight! She tosses and turns In visions divine; For within her Will burns Like a lamp in a shrine! . . . And now you've the reason that Clari is gay, As a bird on the bough or a brooklet at play; And now you've the reason why Clari is bright, Why she smiles all the day and is glad all the night; For the light having entered her bosom remains, Darts fire to her glances and warmth thro her veins, Makes her tricksy and merry, yet full of the power Of the wind and the rain, and the storm and the shower; Half wise in the ways of the world, and half simple, As sly as a kiss is, as deep as a dimple, A spirit that sings like a bird on a tree,— ‘I love my love, and my love loves me!’ GIANT DESPAIR. I. His Death. Sad is the plight of Giant Despair, In Doubting Castle sick lies he! The castle is built on a headland bare, And looks on the wash of a whirling Sea. With the noise in his ears and the gleam in his eyes Of the breaking waves that beneath him beat, Proption pillows the Giant lies, Pillowed, too, are his gouty feet. In and out the Leeches of Souls Run and chatter and prate and pray— But the great wind wails and the thunder rolls: None may banish his gloom away. With parchment cheek and lack-lustre eye He looketh out on the stormy scene— Cruel is he and bloody and sly, Lustful and bad his life hath been. O Priests who stand and whisper there, While he groans and curses and shrinks for fear, What can ye say to Giant Despair To comfort him now his end is near? Fat and oily and sweet, cries one:— Comfort, O comfort! for heaven is sure— There the believer shall revel in fun, And all delight that is plump and pure. ‘Nothing delicious the Lord denies, Rosy wine he shall drink in bliss’— ‘Add, moreover,’ another cries, ‘Waists to encircle and lips to kiss.’ With parchment cheek and lack-lustre eye The Giant lies and makes no sign: Women's falsehood has made him sigh, He is sick of the very sight of wine. ‘Comfort!’ another crieth loud, ‘Full of music shall be thy breast, Thou shalt sit full proud on a rosy cloud, Happy and idle, amongst the blest— ‘All shall be stainless and sweet and fair; All shall be merry from night to morn.’ Giant Despair stirred in his chair, Scowled at the speaker and grunted scorn. Then one said this and one said that, And all were full of the world to be: Yet duller and bitter the Giant sat Scowling out at the sullen Sea. And all the storm of the wind and rain, And all the rage of the wrathful wave, Flowed in and out of the Giant's brain As the surge in and out of a dank seacave. Forth, at last, stept a shape so grey, Crown'd with poppy, and shrouded deep; He touch'd the Giant with hand of clay. And held a goblet—‘Drink this, and sleep. Over thy grave the grass shall grow— Roses too, the white and the red— The generations shall come and go, But thou shalt slumber,’ the spirit said ‘Many a year shall blossom and fade, Many a life be given and taken, Ere from thy sleep in the silent shade Thou, with a thrill of new life, shalt waken. The Giant smiled. Still loud and strong Sounded the sob of the weary Sea. ‘My ears are sick!—may my sleep be long! For ever and ever, if that may be.’ II. After Who on the Giant's tomb Sits in the twilight gloom, With white hands folded? Her breath comes fresh and warm; Silent she waits, a form Divinely moulded. Maiden she is; with eyes That search the dark still skies She sits in shadow; Strewn scented at her feet Are rue and lilies sweet, And flowers o' the meadow. And in her wild black hair Are wild weeds passing fair, Pluck'd from dark places— Dumb, dead, her sweet lips are, And fixëd as a star Her marble face is. Under God's starless cope, Vestured in white sits Hope, A musing maiden, Under a yew sits she, Watching most silently The gates of Eden. Afar away they shine! While up those depths divine Her eyes are turning— And one by one on high The strange lamps of the sky Are dimly burning. Such sounds as fill'd with care The dark heart of Despair Disturb her never,— Tho' close to her white feet That mighty Sea doth beat, Moaning for ever. She sees the foam-flash gleam, She hears, in a half dream, The muffled thunder. The salt dew fills her hair; Her thoughts are otherwhere, Watching in wonder. There let her sit alone, Ev'n as a shape of stone In twilight gleaming; Despair's pale monument, There let her sit, content, Waiting and dreaming. Ah! which were sweetest, best? With dead Despair to rest In sleep unbroken; Or with that marble Maid To watch, to sit in the shade, Waiting a token? THE MOUNTAIN WELL. Here, on the sultry mountain's face, Although the heat broods bright around, The runlet, in a mossy place, Drips, drop by drop, without a sound, Into a basin cool yet bright, Half-shaded from the golden light. All is as still as sleep; on high The clouds float soft and white as wool; Fern-fringëd crags and boulders lie Sun-parch'd around the dewy pool; Beneath, the mountain pathway twines, Above, peaks rise and sunlight shines. How still it is! nought moves or stirs. Afar below, the lake of blue, With purple islands dark with firs, Gleams smooth as glass and dim as dew: And mountain, isle, and woodland rest Within the mirror of its breast. All motionless on yonder stone The white grouse crouches in the light; On high among the crags, alone, The eagle sheathes his piercing sight, Clutching the peak amid the heat, His shadow black'ning at his feet. No living thing that flies or creeps Comes near the well this noontide hour; The sunlight scorches crags and steeps, The heather shrinks its purple flower; The wild brook glisters in its bed, Silent and faded to a thread. But when the sun is in the west, And sheds soft crimson o'er the place, The grey-hen creeping from her nest, Leaving her dull brown eggs a space, Comes hither, pausing on the brink With quick sharp eyes, and stoops to drink. Or from the stones the foumart slim Doth hither steal at eve to cool His bloody mouth; or on the brim The blue hare, shadow'd in the pool, Sits up erect, and thro' the rocks Springs, at the coming of the fox. How many a strange and gentle thing Hath seen its face reflected here! How oft at gloaming hath the spring Mirror'd the moist eyes of the deer, While glen and corry, peak and height, Were redd'ning in the rosy light! Here stain'd with blood and foamy-lipt, The stag of ten hath paused for breath, His blood in the sad pool hath dript Dark, drop by drop, before his death, While he has watched, with looks of woe, The hunter toiling from below. How sweet it lies! how dark and cool! Half shaded by the crag on high, A tiny place, a shallow pool, Yet with its own dark depth of sky— Renewed for ever with no will By the soft trickling of the hill. All thro' the dim and dewy night It gathers coolness drop by drop, While in the moon the crags gleam white, And on the silent mountain top The evening star of liquid dew Gleams like a diamond in the blue. A never-empty hand, a dim Dark eye for dews of love to fill, A constant cup full to the brim, Hast thou, O fount upon the hill. I stoop and kiss thy lips; and so, Refresh'd, I bless thee as I go. THE SONG OF THE SHEALING. The rude cluster of huts in the midst of the distant pasturage whither the cattle were driven in summer, and where they grazed for many weeks, attended by the women and maidens of the farm. O who sits and sings the sad song of the Shealing, Alone on the hill-side, alone in the night! Dead still through the shadows the moonlight is stealing, The dew's on the heather, the mist on the height. She sitteth in silence, and singeth so slowly; She milks the dark kine with her fingers so fair. White woe of the lost, may her vigil be holy! The song of the Shealing is sad on the air. Dark strewn on the grass are the stones of the Shealing, The wild leek and nettle grow black over all; Here morning to gloaming the black hawk is wheeling, And foumart and stoat suckle young in the wall. It's lonely by daylight, but nightly, ah! nightly, She comes from her cave, with her kine, and sits there. Oh, hearken! she sings, and her face gleams so whitely: The song of the Shealing is sad on the air. O who would not hark to the song of the Shealing! I stand in the shadow, I listen and sigh; The day comes again, happy voices are pealing, The blue smoke curls up to the sweet summer sky; O red in the sunset the kine gather yonder, The maidens are milking with rosy feet bare; The sheep-dog is barking,—I hear it and ponder,— The song of the Shealing is sad on the air. O green was the pasture, and sweet was the Shealing, And kind were the maidens barefooted and free, And full of enchantment was Love's tender feeling When the moon rose so silently up from the sea. And on the green knolls walked the loved and the lover, Wrapt warm in one plaid, with one thought and one care: I see them! I hear them! my heart's running over,— The song of the Shealing is sad on the air. O spirit of whiteness, O Ghost of the Shealing! Sing on, and sing low in the shade of the hill; The picture has faded your voice was revealing, The white owl looks out through the threshold so chill. There's a star on Ben Rannoch shines softly above you, It sparkles all night on the dew in your hair: White Soul of the Silence, we hear you and love you,— The song of the Shealing is sad on the air. THE SECRET OF THE MERE. I built a hut beside the Mere, A lowly hut of turf and stone; Therein I thought from year to year To dwell in silence and alone, Watching the lights of heaven chase The phantoms on the water's face. The world of men was far away; There was no sound, no speech, no cry; All desolate the dark Mere lay Under the mountains and the sky— A sullen Mere, where sadly brood Dark shadows of the solitude. ‘It is an evil world,’ I said; ‘There is no hope, my doom is dark.’ And in despair of soul I fled Where not another eye might mark My silent pain, my heart's distress, And all my spirit's weariness. And when I came unto the Mere, It lay and gleam'd through days of gloom. The livid mountains gather'd drear All round, like stones upon a tomb; Around its margin rusted red The dark earth crumbled 'neath my tread. I said, ‘It is a godless place— Dark, desolate, and curst, like me. Here, through all seasons, shall my face Behold its image silently.’ And from that hour I linger'd there In protestation and despair. For mark, the hills were stone and sand, Not strewn with scented red or green— All empty as a dead man's hand, And empty lay the Mere between. No flocks fed there, no shepherd's cry Awoke the echoes of the sky. And through a sullen mist I came, And beast-like crept unto my lair; And many days I crouched in shame Out of the sunshine and sweet air. I heard the passing wind and rain, Like weary waves within the brain. But when I rose and glimmer'd forth, Ghost-wise across my threshold cold, The clouds had lifted west and north, And all the peaks were touch'd with gold. I smiled in scorn; far down beneath The waters lay as dark as death. I said, ‘Go by, O golden light! Thou canst not scatter darkness here. In two sad bosoms there is night, In mine and in the lonely Mere; Light thou thy lamps, and go thy way.’ It went, and all the heavens grew grey. And when the lamps of heaven were lit, I did not raise mine eyes to see, But watch'd the ghostly glimmers flit On the black waters silently. I hid my face from heaven, and kept Dark vigil when the bright sun slept. And ever when the daylight grew I saw with joy the hills were high; From dawn to dark, the live day through, Not lighting as the sun went by; Only at noon one finger-ray Touch'd us, and then was drawn away. I cried, ‘God cannot find me now; Done now am I with praise or pain.’ Beside the Mere, with darken'd brow, I walk'd as desolate as Cain. I cried, ‘Not even God could rear One seed of love or blessing here!’ 'Twas Spring that day; the air was chill; Above the heights white clouds were roll'd, The Mere below was blue as steel, And all the air was chill and cold, When suddenly from air and sky I heard a solitary cry. Ah me! it was the same sweet sound That I had heard afar away; Sad echoes waken'd all around Out of the rocks and caverns grey, And looking upward, weary-eyed, I saw the gentle bird that cried. Upon a rock sat that sweet bird, As he had sat on pale or tree, And while the hills and waters heard, He named his name to them and me. I thought, ‘God sends the Spring again, But here at least it comes in vain!’ From rock to rock I saw him fly, Silent in flight, but loud at rest; And ever at his summer cry The mountains gladden'd and seem'd bless'd, And in the hollows of them all Faint flames of grass began to crawl! Some secret hand I could not see Was busy where I dwelt alone; It touched with tender tracery, Faint as a breath, the cliffs of stone; Out of the earth it drew soft moss, And lichens shapen like the Cross. And lo! at every step I took Some faint life lived, some sweetness stirred, While loosen'd torrents leapt and shook Their shining hair to hear the bird, And white clouds ran across the blue, And sweet sights rose, and sweet sounds grew. I hated every sight and sound; I hated most that happy cry. I saw the mountains glory-crown'd, And the bright heavens drifting by; I felt the earth beneath my tread, Now kindling quick, that late was dead! Daily I stole unto the Mere, And black as ever was its sleep. Close to its margin all was drear; I heard the weary waters creep. I laugh'd aloud, ‘Though all grow light, We twain keep dark, in God's despite! ‘We will not smile nor utter praise; He made us dark, and dark we brood. Sun-hating, desolate of days, We dwell apart in solitude. Let Him light lamps for all the land; We darken and elude His hand.’ Scarce had I spoken in such wise, When as before I heard the bird, And lo! the Mere beneath mine eyes Was deeply, mystically stirred: A sunbeam broke its gloom apart, And Heaven trembled in its heart; There, clustering in that under-gloom, Like rising stars that open dim, Innumerable, leaf and bloom, I saw the water-lilies swim, Still 'neath the surface dark to sight, But creeping upward to the light. As countless as the lights above, Stirring and glimmering below, They gather'd; and I watched them move, Till on the surface, white as snow, One came, grew glad, and open'd up, A pinch of gold in its white cup! Then suddenly within my breast Some life of rapture open'd too, And I forgot my bitter quest, Watching that glory as it grew; For, leaf by leaf and flower by flower, The lilies opened from that hour. And soon the gloomy Mere was sown With oilèd leaves and stars of white; The trumpet of the wind was blown Far overhead, from height to height, And lo! the Mere, from day to day, Grew starry as the Milky Way. I could not bear to dwell apart With so divine and bright a thing; I felt the dark depths of my heart Were stirring, trembling, wakening, I watched the Mere, and saw it shine, E'en as the eye of God on mine. As one that riseth in his tomb, I rose and wept in soul's distress; I had not fear'd His wrath and gloom; But now I fear'd His loveliness. I craved for peace from God, and then Crept back and made my peace with men! MNEMOSYNE; OR, THE RETROSPECT. Still were the azure fields, thick strewn With stars, and trod by luminous feet; In the low west the wan white Moon Walked in her winding-sheet— Holding her taper up, to see Thy cold fair face, Mnemosyne. And on that face her lustre fell, Deepening the marble pallor there, While by the stream, and down the dell, Thy slow still feet did fare; Thy maiden thoughts were far from me, Thy lips were dumb, Mnemosyne. I knew thee by a simpler name, Meet for a maid of English birth, And though thy beauty put to shame All beauty born of earth, Not till that night could my soul see Thy soul's dark depths, Mnemosyne! At last thy voice thrilled soft and low— ‘Oh, blessed be the silent night! It brings strange life of long ago Back to the soul's sad sight— It trances sense, and thought is free To tremble through eternity. ‘Oh, thinkest thou this life we live, In this strange haunted planet nurst, So mystical, so fugitive, Could be the last? or first? Nay, I remember!’—Pale stood she, Fronting the west, Mnemosyne. The moonlight on her cheek of snow, The star-dew on her raven hair, Her eyes in one divine dark glow On heaven, she waited there— ‘Nay, I remember!’ murmured she, The earthly maid, Mnemosyne. And as she spake, it seemed I saw Before me, in the mystic light, That old Greek woman's-shape of awe, Large, lustrous-eyed, and white— The twilight goddess, fair to see, With heavenly eyes—Mnemosyne! The haunter of green moonlit tombs, The reader of old midnight lore, The glorious walker through God's glooms, Back-looking evermore. I shook, and almost bent the knee, Naming the name, ‘Mnemosyne!’ . . . ‘I can remember!—all the day Memory is dark, the past is dead, But when the sunshine fades away, And in the void o'erhead Heaven's eyes flash open, I can see That lost life!’ said Mnemosyne. ‘Before this mortal sphere I trod, I breathed some strange and heavenly air; Ay, wandered 'mid the glooms of God, A living soul, up there! The old lost life comes back to me With starry gleams of memory! ‘I can remember!’—In a trance, O love, thou didst upgazing stand, Nor turned from heaven thy lustrous glance, While soft I kissed thy hand, Whispering that mystic name to thee, ‘Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne!’ And all the luminous eyes above Concentred one still gaze on thine, When warm wild words of earthly love Poured in thine ears divine, Till, with thy soft lips kissing me, Thy soul saw mine, Mnemosyne! A sense of that forgotten life Blew on our cheeks like living breath; Lifted beyond the world's dark strife, Above the gates of Death, Hand linked in hand, again lived we That starlight life of ecstasy! Go by, bright days of golden blooms! She shrinks and darkens in your gleam; Come, starry nights and mystic glooms, And deepen that sweet dream! Let her remember; let her be Priestess of peace—Mnemosyne! O child of heaven, the life we live, In this strange haunted planet nurst, So mystical, so fugitive, Is not the last, or first; That lost life was, new life shall be— So keep thy name,—‘Mnemosyne!’ VANITY FAIR. I. Here's a babble In Vanity Fair! Here's a rabble Of folk on the stare! Here's a crying, Selling and buying, Groaning and grumbling, Pushing and stumbling! Tootle-te-toot! Rum-ti-tum-tum! They blow the flute, And they beat the drum. And yonder in rows Are the painted shows, Where zany and clown With ‘Walk in, walk in!’ Stalk up and down, While the people grin. Hold me tighter, my pretty one, We'll elbow our way and see the fun. In we go, where they scramble and scream— What a rabble! it's like a dream! Trip it merrily, Pretty one, On we stray cheerily Full of the fun: Punch and Judy; Fiddlestring; Acrobats moody Making a ring; Clowns cutting capers At every show; Bucolic gapers Grinning below; Quiet conjurers quick and sly Making the public halfpence fly; Quacks with boluses, nostrums, and pills, Vending cures for the flesh and its ills; Every one bawling—(O the din!) Every voice calling—‘Walk in, walk in.’ ‘Stop the thief!’—how they carry the shout! How the crowd eddies in and out! Lean and thin with quivering lip The rascal writhes in his captor's grip: He looks all round with a hungry stare; The mob groans round him and longs to tear— Off to the gaol the scarecrow bear! We're virtuous people in Vanity Fair! All together, Christian and Jew, Birds of fine feather, And ragged too, Dukes and earls, And ballet girls, Philosophers, And patterers; The poor from the city, The wild sea-rover, The beggar witty Half-seas over, The gipsy pretty Red from a romp in the clover. Right foot, left foot, we trip it and toe it, You the pretty girl, I your poet, Rubbing sleeves with great and small, Jostling along through the heart of them all. Our hearts are leaping, our heads are dizzy, The trade's so merry, the mirth so busy, We sqùeeze along and we gasp for air, In the hurry and flurry of Vanity Fair. II. Clari, my sweetest, Trimmest and neatest, Why this alarm? Why are you sighing, Fluttering and crying, And gripping my arm? ‘Come away! come away! 'Tis so sad! 'Tis so loud! My soul swoons away, To look at the crowd! O hark how they cry— I am sick, let us fly!’ O Clari, sweet blending of fire and of air, Come along, come along, out of Vanity Fair. Out yonder are fields and the sky and the trees— And the only sounds there are the birds and the breeze, And the water that throbs in its green woodland nest, Like the heart that is beating so loud in your breast. . . . Breathless, flushing, Faint with the crushing, Here we are— Night is coming, Droning and humming Sounds Vanity Fair afar; And its light, as the night Cometh down, is cast bright On the sky far away . . . How strange feels this stillness! Grey and more grey Comes the night with its chillness. Clari, where are we? Outside the Fair, With the great black earth and the sky and the air, All alone—Hold me tighter! The noise of the rout Was dreadful within, but more dreadful without Seems the silence. O God! see the pale moon arise, And the hills black as ink in the shade, and the eyes Of the stars fix'd on ours from the terrible skies. What is this looming Against the light, Silent and glooming In the chilly night? And what are these clinging, Three in a row, Dismally, swinging When the wind doth blow? Three black figures against the light, Their faces white and their legs strapt tight, Having a swing in the wind this night! O hold me faster, who is she That stands at the foot of the cross-shaped tree? Cowl'd, barefooted, with hooded face, What doth she in the ghostly place? Silent she stands, a sad beholder! Stop, let me touch her on the shoulder. The moon shines cold On the silent place— O God, I behold The dear dead face! She turns unto me Calm and white, Her eyes thrill through me With piteous light. How cold yet how sweet In the night-wind she stands! See, the poor wounded feet! See, the poor pleading hands! Is it she? Kneel and pray! O my child, have no care, She is near—Hath she fled? Did we dream? Was she there? Ah, cold is the night, and the earth lieth bare, And, distant and deep, a dull sound fills the air— The wash of the waters of Vanity Fair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. The Earthquake. (1885.) DEDICATION: AD MATREM. I. One deathless flame, one holy name, One light that shines where'er I move, Are thine, out of whose life I came, Through whom I live and love. Dearest, I knew thee ere I knew Myself, and, stirring to thy breath, From fountains of thy soul I drew This soul discerning Death. The light of sun and stars, the clear Still air of yonder azure space, The seas and sands of this green sphere, That is my dwelling-place. All form, all motion, all delight, Fused in thy frame flash'd on to mine, Grew quick, and woke to sense and sight, And last, to Love divine! A thousand gifts the green earth gives Out of the fulness of her breast, But she by whom one loves and lives Is God's gift, and the best. Fair type of tenderness and power, Of Love whence all things sweetly flow, Constant as God through every hour Of happiness or woe,— My Mother, take the book I bring, Sure of thy blessing on my brow! This life of mine, these songs I sing, Are thine,—for they are thou! Yea, they are thine, as they are his, That other part of thee and me, Who greeted with a father's kiss The child upon thy knee, He is not lost (or all were lost); His voice ere long shall call us hence: Unchanged he stands, though he has crost The borderland of sense. For God were as a drop of dew, If individual love could fall Back from the conscious type, whereto It floweth, crowning all! When yonder sun has ceased to shine This earth subsist, those waters roll, God shall preserve each breathing sign Of Love's eternal soul! . . . . One deathless flame, one holy name, One light that shines where'er I move, Are thine, out of whose life I came, Through whom I live and love! II. Even as I utter'd in such wise Thy praises, kneeling on my knee, The Spirit with the pitiless eyes Came up and gazed on thee! He lingered long beside thy bed, But hour by hour his face grew fair: The greater Spirit overhead Was list'ning to my prayer! Ah yes! He smiled on thee and me, Our Father who is in the skies: I felt His mercy—I could see His strange, still, tearless eyes! I clasped thee to my aching heart, I prayed till the dread Shape passed on: God heard my cry—He did not part The mother and the son! And all my pains and lonely fears Trembled to rapturous hope, and lo! In passionate prayer that broke to tears I watch'd the Shadow go! III. I asked for bread—a stone was given; I asked for Fame—men mock'd at me; I asked for Love—my heart was riven By man's worst cruelty. I wander'd haunted and alone, I sank in doubts from day to day; The snake Detraction crawl'd upon The roof'neath which I lay. I rush'd into the world, and smote The first proud foe that pass'd along; Then treachery fasten'd on my throat And drained my soul of song. Yet, dearest, thou wast one of three Who watch'd beside me, white as snow: More rich than any king could be Was I, yet did not know! Fool, to be clamouring for gold, When I possess'd a wealth divine! Fool, to ask praises from the cold World, when the worlds were mine! Fool, to go arm'd in hate and fear, When Heaven itself broke blue above; Yea, thrice a fool, too deaf to hear The still small voice of Love! Three angels to my hearth were given— Margaret, Mary, Harriett— One watching waits in yonder heaven, But two are with me yet. Margaret with the mother's eyes, The sad grey hair, the holy mien, Walks by my side, while Mary lies Under the kirkyard green. [For darkness wrapt me like a cloud, While the pale spirit men name Death Came, with white lilies and a shroud, And hush'd an angel's breath.] And she, Love's youngest child divine, Cloth'd on with radiance heavenly sweet, Places her little hand in mine And guides my faltering feet! The earthly tumult fades away, The waters sigh, the stars keep chime, Rose-red the great celestial Day Walks the waste waves of Time. And so one thing at least is sure— Love, and the fountain whence it flows! God keep me passionately pure To drink its deep repose! Bring me no laurel wreaths to deck My brow, no gold in large increase; Twine loving arms around my neck, And chain my soul to peace! R.B. Southend-on-Sea, Essex, May 1885. PRELUDE. That summer when the shocks of Earthquake came Under the very streets of the Great City, The Lady Barbara was the first to fly; Yet flew not far, but pausing with her train At Ferndale Priory, on the banks of Tweed, Sat in the sun and held her frighten'd court. Now thus the thing befell. The first shock came At midnight, when the City partly slept, But here and there, where lights of feast were lit And men and women circled in the dance, A murmur like the very voice of God, A rocking like the rocking of the Deep, Came, and the revellers looked at one another In terror dumb as death; a moment's space, And all again was still, and haggard men Question'd if it had only been a dream. Next day the public journals blazed abroad The nameless terror; how at dead of night A deep vibration like a thunder-crash, Faint yet distinct, brief yet electrical, Had run through London; how some fiery force, Volcanic, geocentric, such as that Which in the former time laid Lisbon low, Had stirred the roots of that vast tree of life, The mighty City; how the troubled Thames Had risen like a serpent in the night, And, shuddering, overflown its slimy banks; How the dark streets were shaken, rocked, and riven, Above the sudden and mysterious swell Of some dark subterranean sea of fire. With hand half-palsied from a nameless fear The newsman nigh forgot his flowers of speech, Telling of columns tottering to the fall, Of shattered dwellings and of broken panes, Of sleepers wakening in the dead of night, Their white beds surging like the waves o' the sea! At Limehouse, on the troubled river-side, A factory had fallen; farther east, A narrow street had open'd to its sewers, Just wide enough to show the seams of stone, While the black dwellings upon either side, With fissured walls and crackling window-panes, Rock'd back from their foundations, but as yet Stood firm and fell not; on the western side Of great St. Paul's, by folk descried at dawn, A running crack like forkèd lightning ran— Strange as the fabled writing on the wall, And, like that writing, ominous of doom. Yet, for the rest, the City stood unscathed. The Earthquake, like a monster lioness Watching its victim, some poor helpless lamb, Having first stretched one cruel fatal claw To strike it into terror, crouch'd unseen, While through the affrighted victim's feeble frame Trembled mesmeric thrills of nameless fear And dangerous expectation. All next day The trouble and the hum of terror grew, And when again the clouds of darkness fell, Men feared to creep into their beds and sleep, Lest the dark Deep should open under them! So many sat in vigil, listening All through the solemn watches of the night, Which nevertheless passed by in starry peace; And when the next night, and the next again, Went by in silence, London breath'd once more, The sounds of life once more grew jubilant, And from their watch-towers and observatories The hierarchy of Science reassured The trembling townsfolk, bade them cast off fear, Because the threat of doom had passed away. But on the fourth night, when the streets were still, Another throb from earths fierce heart of fire Ran through the City with a thunder-shock, Though feebler than the first: once more the Thames Rose loudly sobbing and o'erswept its bed; Once more the streets and walls chattered like teeth; Once more men wakened shuddering out of sleep With that dread sough of warning in their ears! Then preachers prophesied the end of all, Doom, and the opening of the seventh great seal; While in the lonely streets and crowded lanes The haggard folk clustered as thick as ants Which feel the anthill crumbling underneath Uprooted by the mole; the palaces Were empty of their regal butterflies; The parks and public squares were desolate, The theatres abandoned to the dust, And all glad sounds of merriment and feast Hushed in the princely dwellings of the proud. But in the city still, and in the marts The lamps of commerce flickered timorously; A few pale men still walked about on 'Change, And in the darkened vaults of dusty banks Gaunt slaves still guarded gold. Then first of those Who fled before the dark Cimmerian threat Was that young wife whose delicate nether limbs Were brawly buskin'd with celestial blue— The Lady Barbara of Kensington. Who doth not know our Barbara the learned, Flower of Midlothian and the agnostic queen, Who, full of culture to the finger tips, A Scots earl's daughter, born 'neath Arthur's Seat, Young, bonnie, winsome, and a poetess, Married the little Yankee millionaire, And flitted from the North to Babylon? Her London mansion was the home of Art, In style antique, with Argus on the walls And “Salve” on the threshold of the door; Her guests the very learned of the land And every guest a lion great or small. All through the season to her afternoons The favourites of Fashion and the Muse,— The last great traveller in gorilla-land, The newest painter or musician, The poet latest found and most divine,— Flock'd, sure of worship and a cup of tea; But chiefly (for our Barbara, understand, Was nothing if not philosophical!) The modern savant and the scientist, The students of the heavens and the earth, Professors of all 'ologies and 'isms, Found there a welcome; there, in tongues diverse As those that puzzled Babel long ago, They wrangled o'er the nebular theory, The spectrum of the tail of the new comet Just seen in Capricornus, Bastian's scheme Of life's beginning. Nor the occult alone, But every male or female wanderer Out of the beaten highway of the creeds Was gathered into Barbara's peaceful fold: The castaway who had, in soul's despair, His cassock lost, his prayer-book left i' the hold, Plunged overboard from that old ship the Church, Now tossing water-logg'd amidst the storm; The Arian and the Unitarian, The lady Medium, the Spiritualist, The Æsthetic, who, proclaiming Art for Art, Carving his God on his own handiwork, Proves totem-worship not an empty dream. But when the murmur of the Earthquake came, The teacup trembled in the scoffer's hand, The wise looked foolish, and the lions ran Lowing together like affrighted stirks In that dread moment, he who faced the Sphinx And read annihilation in its eyes, Who, from the cynosure of mastery, Survey'd the conflict and the wreck of worlds, Saw suns grow dark like torches suddenly Plunged hissing into water, and foretold, With scientific equanimity, The sure extinction of the human race, Became as terror-stricken as a bairn Who, waking suddenly at dead of night To find the night-light out, begins to wail. Then many named God's Judgment with a sigh Who thitherto had named it with a smile! But ever fleet in feminine resolve, And now made fleeter by a fluttering fear, Our Barbara did not pause to think or pray, But, followed by her folk and husband, fled Back to her native Scotland, where she dwelt In safety at the Priory, gathering Faint rumours from the City far away. Thence, when her fears had time for breathing space, And when no message of destruction came, She issued to her chosen votaries Sweet-scented missives in her own fair hand, Bidding them, while the terror held the City, To attend her Court of Learning, bright and glad As any mediæval Court of Love, In that fair dwelling on the banks of Tweed. In flocks they came, the apostles of the creeds, Poets and painters and philosophers, Teachers and preachers, lions, lionesses, Long-haired æsthetes, long-winded scientists; And since the Priory could not lodge them all, The inns and cottages around about Were full of spectacled and bearded men, Whose strange ways made the country people gape In wonder and in awe; but every day They gathered at the Priory, droning there Like bees about their queen. 'Twas summer time. The hills and vales had put their glory on, And wandering in Barbara's Paradise, You would have thought the world as sweet and safe As on Creation's day. Fronting the south, Upon the shoulder of a woody brae, The broad and comely modern mansion stood, And pausing on its air-hung terraces You saw beneath you on the river-side The roofless ruin whence it took its name. All round stretched park and pale, with colonnades Where the horse-chestnut spread its seven-leafed fan And broke to amber foam of waxen blooms O'er deep green dells where dappled fallow deer Like restless shadows among shadows moved; With ponds of silver, where with dripping run The marble Naiad o'er her image hung, Girt with the water-lily's oilèd leaves; With sweeps of fronded fern and flowery knolls As full of twinkling ears and watchful eyes— Coney and squirrel, doe and leveret— As any happy dell in Fairyland! Beyond the woodland, sloping to the banks, Were shaven lawns with flower-edged paths between. In midst of these, upon the river-side, Clearly reflected in the running river, The Priory ruins, roofless, windowless, And thickly carpeted with emerald grass. Here, where the uncut hair o' the grass grows deep, The summer light falls solemn and subdued, While entering the mouldering roofless walls, Pencilled with golden moss and lichens grey Where'er the night-black ivy doth not crawl, You see the jackdaws in a cawing crowd, Like spirits of the long-departed monks, Rise from the topmost ruins clamorously And flit against the azure patch of sky. The world, the thought of man, dissolves away, And with a sea of stillness overhead You walk in awe, even like a charmèd man Pacing the voiceless bottom of the Deep. Crossing the ivy-hung refectory You glide beneath a broad low porch of stone, And in a moment, ere you know it, pass From shadow into sunlight,—for you stand Upon a terrace set with flowery urns Descending to the very water's brim. Upon that terrace, in the summer sheen. There stands the figure of a naked Faun, Goat-eared, goat-footed, playing on his pipes And smiling like the very Pan himself. Straightway upon the ears (or so it seems) There comes the summer sound of singing birds, Of fountains falling, runlets murmuring, Leaves rustling, wood and valley echoing In joy primeval to that sylvan sound; And glancing back upon the Priory walls, O'er which the jackdaws hover in a crowd, You half expect to see the monks appear, Hornèd like satyrs, shouting, streaming forth To foot it to the merry pipes of Pan. Upon this terrace sat, one summer day, Our hostess, smiling 'neath her parasol On troops of motley guests; close to her side Three Graces, cousins, born in Annandale, With country cheeks of strawberry and cream; A little in the background, grimly pleased, Cigar in mouth, straw hat upon his head, Midas, her husband. Scattered here and there, Grouped on the flowery lawns and garden seats, In summer costumes brighter than the flowers, Or learnèd suits of philosophic black, The fugitives from threaten'd Babylon; While in and out the Priory's ruin'd walls, Like glad bees swarming in and out the hive, Throng'd others, garrulous as the busy daws Gossiping in the ivy overhead. Some on the shining river rowed and sang, Fluttering in shallops round the granite stairs; Some promenaded, deep in learned talk; While liveried lacqueys and trim serving lasses Moved here and there with baskets of ripe fruit, Clusters of grapes, and draughts of mountain dew. 'Twas like a golden glimpse of Arcady Painted by Watteau for a happy court, With nymphs and satyrs neatly modernised, Shepherds and shepherdesses gaily dight As shapes of Dresden china, bright and clean. The Priory in the background, dark and grey Against a sky of clear and burning gold, And in the foreground such a sylvan view Of winding water, fields of growing grain, Clusters of woodland, knolls and bosky bowers, Melting away to dim blue heathery hills, As made the place seem Arcady indeed! Golden the prospect, earth and azure heaven Mingling their happy lights like Life and Love, And eyes that on the winding river gazed Could scarce discern within those crystal depths Water from heaven, heaven from the heavenly stream. ‘What news from London?’ Lady Barbara cried To one, a little dapper scientist, Fresh from the train, who trotted to her seat Shaking her small gloved hand; and with a smile The new-comer replied, ‘The City stands! And though the streets and marts are empty still Of all save those who are over poor to fly, Many believe the peril passed away. This morning's journals say a shock was felt On Thursday at Madrid; if so, the fires Whose fierce pulsations took us unaware, Are running southward, back to warmer zones, Their tropic birthplace, near the heart of Earth.’ ‘Pray God it be so,’ answer'd Barbara; Then turning 'neath her sunshade, she resumed Her converse with the group surrounding her: ‘Dear friends, you are right!—what scene, howe'er so bonnie, What country merriment, howe'er so merry, Can compensate us children of the age For London in the season? I confess, Though Scottish born and Edinboro' bred, From boot to bonnet I'm a Londoner! And even here with chosen friends around I miss the mighty flow, the changeful sound, Of yon vast ocean of Humanity. The canker-worm of Ennui gnaws the heart Of Pleasure's full-blown rose! Come, who'll devise Some sport to fleet away the golden time? Who'll lead our drowsy-headed idleness In flowery fetters of some pleasant toil, Until the Earthquake-Monster is appeased, And gladly once again we enter in Fashion's celestial gate?’ Smiling she paused, And for a space none answered; but the air Was filled with summer music, and we heard, Above the humming of the honey-bees That flitted in and out the flowery knolls, The black rooks sleepily cawing, and the dove Cooing clear answer from the Priory woods; On a wild apple-tree that clung and bloomed High on the ruin'd walls, the blue-wing'd jay Flash'd screaming, and along the river-side The kingfisher, an azure ray, flew past. Thus all things were alive with peaceful joy: The dædal Earth, bright faced and golden hair'd, With ample heaving bosom, sighed for bliss, Through half-closed eyelids blinking up at heaven! Then one said, ‘As near Florence long ago Gallants and gentle dames that fled the Plague Sat 'neath green boughs and passed the golden time In dainty tale-telling, that grew divine On eloquent Boccaccio's honeyed tongue, So let us here, to fleet the summer hours, Tell tales of Mirth and Love and Love's disdain! Be thou our Queen of Love, let these thy maids Twine a green garland for the brows of him Whose tale beguiles the fever'd fancy best!’ ‘Alas!’ said Barbara, sighing wearily, ‘The world is old and grey before its time; And that blind god, who used to run before Its happy feet, and wave the golden torch, Beckoning with smiles, now sits as Darwin's ape Upon its shoulder, whispering “Vanity!” Ours is no Court of Love for amorous dames And bonnie cavaliers; hush d is Love's lyre, Its poet dead, his cold hand on its strings; And all remaining now for man to seek Is the great Problem neither bard nor seer Has help'd as yet to solve!’ Then with a smile Cold as the scalpel, Douglas Sutherland, Critic and comic vivisectionist, Young cynic of the Cynical Review, Scot from the mountains, but a renegade Forswearing homely porridge and the trews, Who, drifting round the compass of the creeds, Had found no foothold for his slippery feet, Cried, ‘The great Problem ever sought by fools, Forgetting that whoever froms the Sphinx, And meets her stony glare, must rave till doom!’ Here the plump pantheist, Spinoza Smith, With luminous eye and hanging underlip, Loose gait, lax logic, interposed and said, ‘Better to rave like the old oracle Than, quivering like a restless tadpole, haunt The muddy shallows of perpetual doubt!’ Turning to Barbara, ‘Since we moderns seek A summer pastime like those Florentines, Why not let that same Problem be our theme, And let each man and woman tell in turn Some chronicle of those who, quick or dead, Have wander'd problem-haunted through the world?’ ‘Agreed!’ cried Barbara; then, brightly turning Her face upon the groups surrounding her, ‘A golden thought, to employ our idleness With tales of meaning and of mystery— Not old wives' rhymes to frighten foolish bairns, But stories wise that sad Philosophy, The way-worn wandering Jew, still toiling on With staff and wallet, croaks at every door! How say you? Shall our new Decameron Take as its theme no little pasteboard god, Pink Cupid or bright-eyed Saint Valentine, But God Himself, the riddle of the worlds?’ Smiling she paused. We looked at one another, And even then we seemed to hear afar The murmur of that subterranean voice Which thundered from the fiery heart of Earth, Threatening the mighty City in its pride. ‘Agreed! agreed!’ we clamoured, echoing her; ‘Begin the sport, and be yourself our Queen!’ ‘Then thus,’ said Barbara, ‘we form our court: Be you our maids of honour’—here she smiled On the three cousins born in Annandale— ‘You gentlemen our faithful cavaliers And braw-drest pages, headed if you please By Verity as learned Chamberlain. Be thou,’ she added (turning next to me), ‘Our poet lyrical and laureate, Breaking our measured prose at intervals To music; and do thou, Sir Whimsical’ (Nodding her head at Douglas as she spoke), ‘Assume the hood and baldrick of the Fool, Here at our elbow set, with privilege To make a passing jest from time to time Of better wiser folk!’ Here Douglas seized A stalk of foxglove drooping purple bells, And shook it, zany-fashion, in the air, Crying ‘By Touchstone and by Rigoletto, I accept the scoffer's office cheerfully, And on my badge, expect much merriment When wise men choose so lunatic a theme!’ ‘To-morrow,’ laughing added Barbara, ‘Our coronation revels shall begin; And after that, each summer afternoon, We shall conjure you, on your fealty, To gather here, and rax your wits to speed The solemn pastime. Till yon smiling sun Again is near his setting, we dismiss Our court, and leave our leal and loving friends Free to devise what other sports they please— To-morrow we shall mount our throne and reign!’ And with that tryst to meet upon the morrow We scattered, some to dream about the park, Some to explore the neighbouring rocks and woods, Some to the dusky Priory libraries, To fleet the moments till the dinner-bell Should bring the pasturing human flocks together. But I, who knew by heart the winding Tweed, Wander'd away along the river-side Glad-hearted and alone, and drank for hours Full sweetness and full summer, pondering The green world's problem with a poet's heart. 'Twas the glad flower-time—over orchard walls, Mossy and golden, softly blushed the pear, Though apple-blooms were falling; scented May Ran quick along the hedgerows, white and red; And lilac, scented like a maiden's breath, Flower'd in sun-shaded gardens, maiden-like; And lush laburnum shook its locks of gold O'er bonnie banks of green and golden broom; The white pea lit its delicate lamps afield, And in the lanes speedwell and campion Cluster'd round snow-white stars of Bethlehem. The bee, with dusty gold upon his thigh, Humm'd busily to himself; the butterfly, A wingèd flower, blew lightly higher and thither; The woods, the fields, the lanes, were all alive With quick-eyed sylvan creatures, numerous As motes i' the sunshine. Cheerily sung the lark, Answer'd from hawthorn branches by the merle, Gold-bill'd and silver-throated. By the river The heron stood as motionless as stone Over his dim blue double, then arose With soft dark flap of wing, to light again Among the speckled shallows lower down. Lingering silent on the banks, I saw The muddy cabin of the water-rat, And in the calm beheld the brown rogue swim, Bearing a green leaf for his little house, His whisker'd nose above the surface peeping, A long bright ripple sparkling in his track. Musing I wandered, till, beyond the braes, The sun sank crimson among purple isles And reefs of black, and from the paling west The round thin filmy moon floated like silk, Then 'gainst the green transparent topmost leaves O' the woodland flutter'd, brightening. Then, the glades Dark'ning, the dusky mavis and the merle Pour'd their precipitate rapture 'mong the boughs, And nestling lovers listen'd as they sang: Lover! lover! Kiss sweet! kiss sweet! sweet! Woo her now! woo her now! The glassy river sparkled smooth as jet, Just touch'd with crystal beams. Soft as a leat The gloaming fell, and flutter'd like a veil Over the half-closed eyelids of the world. Stars glimmer'd faintly, opening one by one And blossoming above me, while I stole Through warmly scented shadows till I gained Dark fern-clad slopes that ran to hills of heather, And looking heavenward saw a painter's vision. There like a naked maiden stood the Moon, Wading in saffron shallows of the west: Timidly, with a tender backward glance, She reach'd a faltering foot to feel the way, Then, brightly smiling, as the lucent waves Wash'd, tipt with splendour, round her swan-white throat, Bent forward, cleft the dusk with ivory hands, And swam in splendour thro' the seas of night. THE FIRST DAY. (RENAISSANCE.) The morrow came; and, when the sun was high, Beneath a silken awning rosy-hued Sat Barbara, smiling on her happy court; The Graces near her, Midas at her side, And all the Sciences and all the Arts, In decent black or motley summer suits, Gathered around her; modern Muses too, From Sappho Syntax in her spectacles To Jennie Homespun, Clapham's idyllist, Called ‘Wordsworth's daughter’ by the small reviews. Nor lacked we grace of stately company From lands beyond the thunders of the Chimes Which turn the small beer of the Senate sour: Dan Paumanok, the Yankee pantheist, Hot gospeller of Nature and the flesh, Who, holding soul but body purified, Vaunted the perfect body fifty years, Then sank beneath a sunstroke paralyzed, A wreck in all save that serener soul Outlooking from his grave and patient eyes. There sat he, in his chair, a craggy form, Snow-bearded, patriarchal, wearing well His crown of kindly sorrow. Close to him, Miranda Jones, the lyric poetess, Lean and æsthetic to the finger-tips, Crouched like a pythoness with lissome limbs, Pale eyes that swam with sybilline desire, And vagrant locks of amber. To this last Queen Barbara turn'd, and smiling royally cried: ‘Barbara to Miranda! Take the harp, And sound the prelude that befits our theme.’ Whereon the other, starting from a trance, Answered, ‘You spoke? My soul was far away! And watching that old Faun whose stony eyes Have seen a hundred summers come and go, Methought he changed, and on his naked back Had drawn a cassock, on his head a cowl, And so, transformed into a very monk, Moaned answer to his comrades, turn'd to daws There in the Priory, cawing high in the air Their pax vobiscum!’ With a laugh then cried Douglas the scoffer, puffing his cigar— ‘The dream was apt, Miranda! Strip the monk In new tunes as in old, you find beneath The satyr's skin; beneath the black rogue's cowl, The satry's swinish leer.’ But scornfully Tossing her python ringlets, she replied— ‘The monks were men, and in their holy hearts, And in their weary eyes, though filled with dust, The elemental pagan lingered still. I read a tale once in a dusty book Bought at a bookstall in a dusty street At Florence—how, long centuries ago, When all the world was gray because of Christ, A sudden glory of the buried world Flashed from the tomb, as Cytherea rose From darkness of the weary and rainy sea; And how a monk (no satyr, but a soul Pure as this sapphire on my finger, sir!), Having with eyes of wonder seen the sight, Died of its rapture. Have you heard the tale? I put it into rhymes which Sweetsong praised One week I was his guest at Sunbury.' ‘Give us the tale!’ we cried, and at a nod From Barbara, our queen and arbitress, Miranda shook her locks and thus began:— JULIA CYTHEREA: A Legend of the Renaissance. I. With shadow black upon the convent wall In fierce white light the musing Monk doth crawl; He sees the lizards pass Beneath him on the grass;— Silent as they, he stirs, and that is all. With blood that slippeth slow as hour-glass sand, He weeds the garden with his lean long hand, The sun beats down on him, But, sunless and most dim, His sad eyes downward look upon the land. Yet once or twice he riseth up his height, Gaunt as a tree he loometh in the light, And gazeth far away Where, through the trembling day, Rome sits and gleams, insufferably bright. His hand he presses on his breast and sighs, Towers, churches, temples, wearily he spies; His black eyes blink i' the ray, His bloodless cheek keeps gray; He stoops again, and weeds, with weary eyes. To him there leapeth one with eager bound, Crying, ‘Ho, Marcus, leave thy garden ground Gird up thy loins and come Down to the streets of Rome— Behold the miracle which men have found! ‘'Tis Venus’ self,—with lips still poppy-red, Light on her cheeks, bright gold upon her head, Divine, yet cold in death, Still living without breath, As white and chill as is her marble bed; ‘By some dark chemic trick of fingers old Embalm'd within that ivory coffin cold, A thousand years i' the tomb Her cheek hath kept its bloom, Her eyes their glory, and her hair its gold. ‘Come down and look upon her in her rest, Her white hands crost upon her whiter breast; One fold of fleecy dress Covers her nakedness; Her face doth smile, as though her dreams are blest.’ The pale monk Marcus scarcely heeds or hears— He stands and through the sunlight sadly peers— ‘Thou ravest, get thee gone!’ He murmureth anon— Thin sounds his voice, yea, faint as falling tears. That other crieth, ‘Doubt me not, but go! Venus awakes; Rome's buried blossoms blow; Not Christ in His winding-sheet Was half so pure and sweet— Run to the Capitol, and thou shalt know!’ He cries, and soon around him others come, All panting, pointing to the far-off dome,— Till, drawn from his cold height To look upon the sight, The pale monk Marcus creepeth down to Rome. II. Now mark what old traditions tell Of how this miracle befell. . . . Nigh fifteen centuries had shed Their snows upon the sad Earth's head Since on the heights of perfect peace Where banqueted the gods of Greece, One starry midnight there did rise That pallid Shape with human eyes, Who, clad in grave-clothes and thorn-crown'd, Stood silently and gazed around From face to face,—and as on each He looked in sorrow with no speech, Each face grew wan and chill as clay, And faded wearily away! Ay, one by one those forms had fled, Till all the heavenly host were dead, Cast down and conquer'd, overthrown Like broken shapes of marble stone. Pallas, with pansies in her hair, Like to a statue wondrous fair Stricken and fall'n;—Selene white, Cold, sleeping in the starry light; Great Zeus, Apollo, and sad Pan, With all his flocks Arcadian, Strewn down like dead leaves on the tomb Of Him who slew them in their bloom. All dead! the brightest and the best! And Cytherea with the rest! And now He too, who cast in thrall All shapes within that banquet-hall, Who came to slay and overcome The shining gods of Greece and Rome, Had crept again to find repose In the dark grave from which He rose; And there for fifteen centuries Had lain unseen with closèd eyes, Had slept, and had not stirr'd a limb, Though men grew mad for lack of Him. ‘Awake, O Christ!’ they cried in pain, ‘For lo! no other gods remain; And Thou hast promised to return With robes that flame and eyes that burn, 'Midst thunder-flash and trumpet-peal, Legions of angels at Thy heel, To take Thy throne, and overwhelm Thine enemies, and rule Thy realm!’ In vain! Within His clay-cold prison Silent He slept, and had not risen— Though all the other gods were fled, Though no god ruled the quick or dead, Though all the eyes of Earth were wet, He slept,—and had not risen yet. Meantime, to keep his name in Rome, The Eighth Pope Innocent had come Instead of Christ, and from Christ's seat Thrown down his bastards to the street— So wither'd up with sin and death, The dark world drew laborious breath Beneath his footstool;—and no fair Dead god would waken to its prayer! It happen'd at this very time, When in the sinful Church's slime Grew monsters of malignant birth, To eat man's substance on the earth, And sit, where gods had sat, in Rome (Where Christ would sit if He should come), In this dark moment of eclipse, When prayer was silent on the lips And faith was dead within the thought, The mystic miracle was wrought. For Lombard workmen, on a day, Digging beneath the Appian way, Sifting the ruins of Rome dead, Untomb'd, in wonder and in dread, A marble coffin strangely scroll'd, Enwrought with ivory and with gold. Stain'd was it with great earthen stains, Worn with the washing of the rains, And splash'd with blots of blood-red clay, But sealèd as a shrine it lay; And when they raised it to the light, After a thousand years of night, Their eyes read its inscription thus: ‘Fulia, the child of Claudius!’ The Church authorities were brought— Great cardinals in raiment wrought With gold and red, and trains resplendent Of mighty priests and monks attendant; And while these cross themselves and strew The coffin cold with holy dew, They force the lid, and lo! they find— Not dust to scatter on the wind, Not bleaching bones, not blacken'd clay Horrible in the light of day, Nought o'er whose sweetness Death hath power, Not dark corruption,—but a Flower! Flower of the flesh, as soft and new As when she drank the sun and dew, Golden her hair with light from heaven, As if she slept but yester-even; Her lips, that softly lay apart, Still red as any beating heart; Her form, still fairy-like and bright, Though marble-cold and lily-white,— Her hands, unwither'd, softly prest Upon her still unstainèd breast,— A Maiden Flower she slumber'd there, After a thousand years still fair, Within her white sarcophagus. ‘Julia, the child of Claudius!’ Out of the coffin cold as ice Rich fumes of cinnabar and spice Still floated; as she lay within Flower-sweet she scented, and her skin Shone as anointed. One soft fold Of precious woof around her roll'd Half veil'd, with its transparent dress, Her lithe and luminous loveliness; Upon her wrists bracelets of gold Were fastened; on one finger cold Glimmer'd an onyx ring. So sweet, She lay, embalm'd from head to feet, Kept (by some secret long forgot) Without a stain, without a spot, As when, a thousand years before, In days of god and emperor, She closed her eyes and slumber'd thus. ‘Julia, the child of Claudius!’ When thus she turn'd with soft last breath Into the chilly arms of Death, She might have seen the happy light Some sixteen years,—but form so bright Ne'er trembled between childish glee And tremulous virginity. Only a child; yet far too fair For any child of mortal air, Since Passion's fiery flame, it seem'd, Still play'd about her locks, and stream'd From 'neath her eyelids; and her limbs Were amber with such light as swims Round Love's own altar; and her lips, Untouch'd by darkness or eclipse, Were wonderful and poppy-red With kisses of a time long dead,— When Love indeed in naked guise Still walk'd the world with awful eyes And flaming hair. So fair she lay, Burning like amber in the ray, As burns a lamp with sweet oils fed Within some shrine no foot may tread, No hand of any mortal mar; And as men gaze on some new star, Men marvell'd while they gazed on her. Soundly she slept, and did not stir: And far away beyond the sea The white Christ slept as sound as she! III. They bore her to the Capitol, And left her lying, where the whole Of Rome might look upon her face. And lo! her beauty fill'd the place Like very sunlight, and her lips Seem'd redder, and her finger-tips Pink-tinted, and the scent that came Out of her mouth seem'd fraught with flame Of a live burning heart; and lo! Her gold-hair caught a deeper glow, Making an aureole of light Around her forehead waxen white; And those who gazed upon her thus, Within her white sarcophagus, Were awed, and felt their hearts grow faint Like folk that look on some dead saint. ‘No saint is she,’ the pale priests said, ‘But of an evil beauty dead The ghost accurst. Behold again The pagan world that Christ hath slain, Kept by the charm of God, to show The fate of fairest flesh below!’ And as they murmur'd thus anew They sprinkled her with holy dew, And while they sprinkled her some thought The sleeper smiled! And thus through Rome, And o'er the land, and past the foam, The rumour of her glory flies; And flocking underneath the skies From dawn to sunset, great crowds press To look upon her loveliness. Prelates and kings and courtiers throng With priests and nobles; old and young; Matron and maid and girl o' the street, And wicked women scented sweet; Soldier and beggar, monk and clown; Nuns from the cloisters, peasants brown From the far hills— Last, to the place There cometh, deathly pale of face, His heart scarce fluttering in his breast, The tall monk Marcus with the rest. IV. He came, he gazed upon her there, Her closèd eyes, her clinging hair, Her marble cheek just flush'd with red; And first he shrank away in dread Like one who fears to break with sound The charm which wraps some sleeper round; Then, in the fumes of spice and myrrh That floated round and over her, Kindling a sense that sweeten'd Death, He seem'd to drink her very breath,— And creeping closer—like a snake That croucheth low in a green brake, Watching a lambkin starry white Which lieth still and slumbereth light— He watch'd in fascination deep The crystal mirror of her sleep; And though they thrust him oft aside, Crept back to mark her, vacant-eyed Like one that dreams. Wolf-like and gaunt, Full of some secret woe and want Only that loveliness could still, Lost to all other wish and will, He paused, while others went and came; And when his comrades named his name He only turn'd a silent face Upon them for a moment's space, And smiled, then dumbly gazed once more. Ever across the marble floor, With murmurs deep and whispers low, The wondering folk did come and go— But never voice or footfall loud, Nor all the trouble of the crowd, Awoke that sleeper from her rest; And when upon her marble breast And o'er her brow and on her lips The sunlight's trembling finger-tips Were laid blood-red, she slumber'd on! And when the wondering crowds were gone, And silent night fell down on Rome, And 'neath the Capitolian dome The shadows blacken'd, still she lay Beauteous as she had been by day;— For round her limbs and o'er her hair Trembled a light serenely fair, And all the darkness of the place Felt the soft starlight of her face;— Upon her, from the dome o'erhead, Great shadowy shapes of spirits dread Gazed darkly down, and all around The shadows brooded with no sound;— Without, beyond the doorway, fell The arm'd heel of the sentinel, Who paced in vigil to and fro Under the mighty portico. Then, when the Capitol was dark, And not a living eye might mark, When the great City slumber'd deep Wrapt in its azure robe of sleep, Out of some shadowy hiding-spot,— Wherein, unseen, suspected not, He had linger'd darkly on till then,— Crept, like a wild beast from its den, Marcus the Monk! Silent, alone, With naked feet on the cold stone, He rose and feebly felt his way To the cold coffin where she lay; And looking down as in a dream He caught the dim and doubtful gleam Of the cold face he could not see. Then kneeling low on bended knee He clutch'd with fingers clammy cold The coffin wrought about with gold, And drank with lips as cold as ice The scents of cinnabar and spice That hover'd o'er the form divine Sleeping therein as in a shrine. Then, lo! beyond the painted pane, The Moon rose, wan and on the wane, And gentle amber light was shed Upon the live form and the dead; And Marcus rose his height and stood, While from his head the monkish hood Fell darkly back, and on his brow Starlight like hoar-frost trembled now, And in his eyes there gleam'd again Hope like despair, rapture like pain. Thus, with his thin hand on his heart, His sad lips softly held apart, He gazed in fascination deep Upon that passion-flower of Sleep! More beautiful, more strangely sweet, Than in the daylight's golden heat, More softly still, more dimly bright, Clothed in the mystery of the night, With small hands folded on her breast, She slumbers on in balmy rest. And now the yellow moonlight lies Upon her lips and closèd eyes, Gleams on her hair of braided gold, Fades on her forehead marble-cold, And o'er her as she lies in death Trembles and broods like frozen breath! Still mystical and strange to sight, Though marble-cold and lily-white, A maiden-flower she slumbers there, After a thousand years still fair, Within her white sarcophagus! Then, haggard, wild-eyed, tremulous, Clasping her coffin gold-enwrought, Marcus the Monk gazed down and caught From the still splendour of her look Strange madness, and his sick soul shook With dark despairs. Then made he moan:— ‘Flower fair as thou no man hath known Since Christ came down—but in thy stead, And in the place of sweet gods dead, The harlot and the concubine Sit haggard, sharing bread and wine At Christ's own board, and mocking man Within the very Vatican! And Christ is dead and will not rise, Though, spat on by the cruel skies, A thousand mortals spirit-sore Creep to His dark tomb and implore;— Yea, the stark Skeleton therein, With shrouded limbs and bandaged chin, Lies still and hears not, crumbling down Beside its crimson thorny crown. Decay is there, and deep decay Within a million tombs of clay, And dark decay of craft and creed Within a million hearts that bleed; Yet here, though all fair things have died, Serene and fair thou dost abide, Preserved to show to our dim sight What shapes of wonder and of light The gods our God has stricken low Fashioned a thousand years ago. O fair white lily, softly pearl'd With dim dews of a happy world Long lost, long miss'd—awake, awake! And save the world for Beauty's sake Instead of Christ's!’ . . . God, is he dreaming? Is this thing sooth, or only seeming? Why doth he tremble to his knees In awe of some new sight he sees? . . . The moon-rays turn to shapes of gold Clinging around that coffin cold,— The stars of night look in, and shine With rapture tremulous and divine,— The figures on the dome above Glimmer, look down, and seem to move,— And lo! the Sleeper's shining hair Grows yet more luminously fair, And light like life's pulsation swims Faint blood-red through her lissome limbs. Behold! she reddens like a rose, Her bosom heaves, her eyes unclose, And (as a maiden from her sleep Stirs with a sigh serene and deep, Half conscious of some broken dream, Half dazzled by the morning beam) She draws one long and balmy breath, And turns upon her bed of death! V. Her bed of death? She is not dead! Her breath is warm, her lips are red, Her hands are fluttering, softly prest Against the warmth of her bright breast; One knee is raised, and from its white The fleecy lawn falls soft and light; And, turning her bright head, she sees The pale Monk moaning on his knees! Then, as a little maid may see, When awakening very peacefully, Some one she loveth waiting near, And gaze upon him with no fear,— She looks upon his wondering face, Smiles gently for a moment's space, Then reaches out her hand! ‘Christ God! Master and Maker, 'neath whose rod This man hath bent so many years, In famine, fever, torture, tears,— Thou God by whom the gods of old Are smitten low and coffin'd cold— Strengthen Thy slave, if such he be, Lest this thing slay him utterly!’ He takes her hand, he clasps it to him, Rapture, like life-blood, kindles through him! He kisseth it, he feels it warm, He strains it to his famish'd form, And crieth on—‘Awake! arise! Love on thy lips, light in thine eyes— Arise! the wide world waits to be Thy servant and to worship thee! Awake! and let the gods that were, Who shaped thee thus divinely fair, And kept thee by some chemic charm Imperishably bright and warm, Awaken too, and take the crown Of Him whose red Cross struck thee down. He died, and will not wake, but thou Didst only rest and sleep till now! And they who framed thee thus divine, And seal'd thee in thy solemn shrine, Perchance are only slumbering too!’ She stirs,—with brightening eyes of blue— She rises from her pillow cold, And rippleth down her locks of gold; She shakes away the shroud of lawn Around her soft sides lightly drawn; She stretches out her arms snow-white, She riseth up in the dim light, She stands erect and smiling sweet, With glistening limbs and rosy feet, Upon the marble floor that gleams Like water in the trembling beams! Hast thou beheld in some green path A nymph of stone, fresh from the bath, One snowy foot within a pool That spreads beneath her rippling cool, The other softly raised, the while She draweth on with sleepy smile Her garment,—and in act to dress Frozen to everlastingness, Full of some maiden thought doth look In silent vision on the brook, While her dark shadow under her Stirs softly, though she doth not stir? Even so that sleeper, when she rose From that divinely deep repose, Paused wondering at herself, and felt The light flow round her limbs, and melt On the white moonlit floor whereon She stood erect, as still as stone. Then unto Marcus it did seem That all things trembled into dream! Clinging around that maiden frame The moonlight kindled into flame, And all the place grew burning gold With beams more bright a thousandfold Than beams of day; the coffin bright Was heap'd with roses red and white, And all the floor seem'd blossom-strewn Crimson and white beneath the moon! With heaving breasts and soft footfall, Amid that glory mystical, The Maiden moved, her eyes of fire Answering his look of dumb desire, Then lo! the very Capitol Grew shrunken like a burning scroll, And vanish'd:—the great City fled;— The glory deepen'd overhead;— Instead of stone beneath their feet Were grass and blossoms scented sweet, A blue sea wrinkling far away Crept foam-fringed round a purple bay, And through a green and flowery land, Under the cloudless sapphire skies, Those twain were walking hand in hand, Looking into each other's eyes! VI. In that green land of light and love It seem'd enough to live and move— To wander hand in hand and see The dewy light on flower and tree, The sparkling of the brooks and streams, The hills asleep in sunny beams; And then to glide on unafraid Through warm deep groves of summer shade, Where the hot sunlight's golden blaze Fell tangled into emerald rays. . . . O hark! 'mid dingles green and deep The dove's cry, like a sound in sleep, At intervals is faintly heard! On her thin eggs the mother-bird Sits brooding, while her mate is seen Flitting across the tree-tops green! What shout is that, what sylvan cry? What shapes are those that flash and fly? Wood-nymphs and satyrs whirling round, Naked and merry, and vine-crown'd; Then with deep laugh and faint halloo Far down the glade they fade from view. . . . What faces bright are those that gaze Out yonder from the leafy haze, And smile, and vanish into air? Silent she stands, supremely fair, Whiter than ivory, on a lawn Flower-strewn and bright and deep-withdrawn In the green bosom of the woods; And while from the green solitudes Come drowsy murmurs, sylvan cries, He gazes gently in her eyes. Beneath their feet a fountain's pool Spreads o'er the grass and ripples cool, And from the diamond depths below A Naiad's face as white as snow Looks up, 'neath glimmering hands that braid Her dripping locks in the green shade. And now again the prospects gleam Into the glory of a dream; And lo! they stand 'mid sand and shells, And watch the waves with sleepy swells Rising and breaking drowsily In a blue crescent of the sea. Beyond them pastoral hills are seen Mist-capt, but roped in purple sheen; And 'midst the clouds above them pass, As in some old magician's glass, Shapes of Immortals that pursue Their path across the dreamful blue. On the white sands they sit and rest, His head is pillow'd on her breast; He feels her heart's warm go-and-come, He sees the blue sea fringed with foam; He marks the white clouds sailing slowly Across the heavens serene and holy; Then closes eyes—thrusts one warm hand For coolness deep in the soft sand— And with the other holdeth hers. So still he sits and never stirs, But feels his life and being blent With all he loves, and is content. Is it still dream? for now they pass Along a pathway of deep grass, And find where Venus sets her shrine Amidst a flowery wood of pine: And side by side they enter there, And kneel with folded hands at prayer A little space—and when 'tis done Glide forth again into the sun. VII. What form is this in white arrayed Far down the woodland colonnade, Approaching slow with a black wand Cross-shapen in her lily hand? Is't Cytherea?—is it she Who rules the green earth and the sea, Who moves abroad with fearless tread Her hand upon a lion's head, Wherever men or beasts are wild, And tames their hearts and makes them mild? Slowly she comes,—a shape of grace, Leading a lion,—and her face Is white and cold and thin as death; And as she cometh near her breath Is very faint and feebly drawn, And heavy on the shaven lawn Her footstep falls, and in her eyes Dwell deathly pain and sad surmise. Why seem all things so sudden chill? Why grows the light on wood and hill Frosty and faint? Why shrinks the sun So coldly as she cometh on? ‘Marcus!’—she cries,—and lo! he stands, With pallid face and outstretch'd hands, Gazing in awe—and from his lips One wondering word in answer slips— ‘Madonna!’ Yea, in sooth 'tis she, Mother of Him who died on Tree, The Virgin from whose milky breast He drank who set the world at rest! Ah me! how pallid and how thin, With clammy grave-cloth 'neath her chin, And dust upon her golden hair, She stands and looks upon him there! Shuddering he moans, with low bent brow, ‘Mother of God, what seekest thou?’ ‘What dost thou here?’ the faint voice cries, While underneath the darkening skies All groweth dim. ‘Frail-hearted one, Why hast thou ceased to serve my Son? And who is this who now doth stand Naked beside thee, with her hand Thrust into thine, and hangs the head, But shows her hot neck blushing red? Let go her hand whoe'er she be— And, for thy soul's sake, follow me!’ But Marcus cried, ‘My Master lies, Silent, with dust upon His eyes— He sleeps and He will ne'er awake. But lo! from cloud, from brook, from brake, From every nook of earth and main, The old gods gather once again. Go back into thy grave once more— Sleep with thy Son, thy reign is o'er— Leave the green world to her and me, Nor mar our loves' eternity!’ Paler the weary Mother grew, And with her sunken eyes of blue Gazed piteously a little space Into his passion-fever'd face— Then pointing with thin hand, she cried To that fair semblance at his side— ‘Follow me, thou! my grave is deep— There by my pillow thou shalt sleep; There shall we wait with darken'd eyes In peace, until my Son shall rise!’ But Marcus clutch'd her with a cry, And all things darken'd 'neath the sky, And tall and terrible and white The Virgin loom'd before his sight, And with a finger cold as ice Touch'd on the shining forehead thrice That gentle vision; and behold! She shiver'd as with deathly cold, And lay a corpse of marble, prest In madness to his burning breast. Then Marcus wail'd, ‘Lost! lost!’ and lo! The cruel heavens began to snow, And all was dark, and a shrill gale Of wintry wind began to wail; But clasping her with piteous cries, He kiss'd her on the mouth and eyes, And kissing cried, ‘Awake! awake!’ Till his heart broke for sorrow's sake; And heavy as a stone he fell. VIII. At dawn (as old traditions tell), When the pale priests and soldiers came To see once more that shining frame Within her marble tomb, behold! Still beautiful, with locks of gold, Unfaded to the finger-tips, With faint pink cheeks and rose-red lips, Her they found softly sleeping on; And by her, turn'd to senseless stone, Watching her face with eyes of lead, Knelt the monk Marcus, cold and dead. He ceased, to a chorus from the Priory walls Of daws thick-throated. Straightway Douglas cried, ‘It is the caws, my soul, it is the caws! Hark how the dusky rascals echo her! They vaunt the merriment of cakes and ale, And other succulent sweets they loved when monks, Above all kneeling and praying in the dark That make the stony heart and horny knee!’ But no one laughed, for on our souls the tale Fell with a touch of sweet solemnity; And we were silent, till a quiet voice, Low like a woman's, murmured: ‘Oftentimes I have dreamed a dream like that (if dream it were), And seen, instead of Cytherea's eyes, The orbs of Dian, passionately pure, Witching the world to worship!’ He who spoke— A man with heavily hanging under lip, Man's brow above a maiden's moist blue eyes— Was Verity, the gentle priest of Art, A vestal spirit, not too masculine To avoid those seizures epileptiform Which virgins have when yielding oracles. He, by the affinity of sex which draws The ivy to the oak-tree, long had loved Not wisely but too well, though reverently, The Scottish prophet, Thomas Ercildoune, Who, thundering for the nations seventy years, Found in the end that he had merely soured The small beer and the milk of his own dwelling. He, Verity, though all his soul was love, Had from his master learned the scolding trick, And so was somewhat shrewish out o' doors. Inside the temple where he ministered His soul was solemnised to perfect speech, And many a storm-toss'd wanderer, listening to him, Had worshipt and been saved. ‘How sweet it were,’ He added, ‘in this godless age of Fact, When hideous monsters of machinery Are fashioned unto largess-giving gods, To uprear on some green mountain-side a shrine To Artemis, the goddess of the pure! For if, as Heine held, the gentler gods Whom Christ drave forth from heaven with whip of cords Survive, but banish'd into lonely lands Do gloomy task work for their bitter bread, Somewhere on this sad earth the heaveneyed Maid Wears homespun, turns the wheel, and is a slave. Upbuild her temple, make it beautiful With shapes of marble wonderfully wrought, Strew it with flowers of antique witchery, And on the altar let the lunar beam Sleep like the white and sacrificial Lamb; And thither on some peaceful summer night Perchance the weary one will come, and shed Peace on the eyelids of her worshippers!’ We listen'd wondering, some with pitying smiles, And others credulous of the fantasy. I answered, ‘Who shall find her? We, who dwell In cities vast and foul as Babylon, Have seen, or seemed to see, the baser gods, Her sisters and her brethren, busy yet As spirits of the orgy and the dance. Smooth Hermes, full of craft as when he filch'd Apollo's horses, wears a modern coat, And helps the citizen to cheat on 'Change; And Jupiter, though feeble and rheumatic, Leading his moulting eagle on the chain, Still creeps about the distant villages And prompts the silly preacher as he throws His Calvinistic lightnings at the boors; And who that ever walk'd down Regent Street At midnight, or some garish summer day At Paris saw the Grand Prix lost and won, Has failed to note the pink divinity, In rags or silk and sealskin, still the same As when she tript Adonis long ago! But for the other, Dian, Artemis, Athenian or Ephesian, who shall say The pure thing lives, where nought that lives is pure? The sunshine knows her not, and the sweet moon, Which used to shine upon her ivory limbs Bright and pellucid in her dusky bath, Now lights the pale street-walker at her trade, And there's an end.’ Buller from Brazenose, Another priest of Art, who holds that Art Is lost if clothed or draped, and in whose eyes The very fig-leaf is a priest's device To mar the fair and archetypal Eve, Broke in with mincing speech and courteous sneer— ‘I have heard that when that good man George the Third Reign'd o'er his farm, this England, Artemis Was noticed raining happy influences Over the national pig-sty! Later still, Arm'd with the British matron's household broom, She drove our Byron out and bang'd the door. Since then, thank God!—or say, since Wordsworth died [Poor man, he came to physic a sick world That wanted wine, and gave it curds and whey!]— Your goddess has been seldom heard or seen. Doubtless she drudges in some parson's house As far as Lapland, where the temperature Is like her bosom, virginal and cold. We want her not in England! Heaven forbid! We need the sun of love to warm our blood, Apollo's blaze and Cytherea's breath To thaw our lives and prove us men indeed!’ While thus he spake, I noticed in our midst A pale young man who had come into the world White-hair'd, and so looked old before his time; His eye was burning, and his delicate hand Was thrust into his bosom, touching there Some secret treasure. Listening he stood, Eager to speak, yet dumb through diffidence. To him the pythoness Miranda Jones Exclaimed, ‘What secret are you hiding there, Close to your heart, or shirt-front, Cousin Fred? I'll swear—a poem!’ Turning with a laugh To Barbara, she added, ‘Speak to him! My cousin Frederick is a poet too, And fain I know would win a poet's praise From this fair company and you, its Queen.’ Then blushing like a girl, and glancing up To encounter Barbara's smile of kind command, The young man answered, ‘Nay, indeed 'tis naught— The merest trifle—not a tale at all; Yet strangely enough, it touches rhyme by rhyme Upon the very quest of which they speak;— I too,’ he added, blushing still more deep, ‘Have chased that same Diana, in a song!’ ‘Then prithee read it,’ cried Queen Barbara, And other voices clamour'd echoing her; And drawing a paper from his breast, the youth Glanced timidly around the company, And then with eye that kindled like a coal Blown with the breath, he eagerly began. PAN AT HAMPTON COURT. ‘O who will worship the great god Pan Out in the woods with me, Now the chestnut spreadeth its seven-leaved fan Over the hive of the bee? Now the cushat cries, and the fallow deer Creep on the woodland way, O who will hearken, and try to hear The voice of the god to-day?’ One May morning as I woke Thus the sweet Muse smiling spoke, Resting pure and radiant-eyed On the pillow at my side,— Sweetest Muse that ever drew Light from sunlight, earth, and dew Sweeter Muse and more divine Than the faded spinsters Nine! Up I sprang and cried aloud, ‘May-day morn, and not a cloud! Out beyond the City dark Spring awakes in Bushey Park; There the royal chestnuts break Into golden foam and make Waxlike flowers like honeycomb, Whither humming wild bees roam; While upon the lakes, whereon Tritons blow through trumps of stone, The great water-lily weaves Milk-white cups and oilèd leaves. Phillis dear, at last 'tis May! Take my hand and come away!’ Out of town by train we went, Poor but merrily content, Phillis in her new spring dress, Dainty bonnet lily-white, Warm with youth and loveliness, Full of love and love's delight; I. the lonely outcast man, Happy and Bohemian, Loving all and hating none Of my brethren 'neath the sun. Soon, a dozen miles away, From the train we lightly leapt, Saw the gardens glancing gay Where the royal fountains leapt, Heard the muffled voices cry In the deep green Maze hard by, Heard the happy fiddler's din From the gardens of the inn; Saw the 'prentice lads and lasses, Pale with dreary days of town, Shuffling feet and jingling glasses; While, like flies around molasses, Gipsies gathered dusky brown! O the merry, merry May! O the happy golden day! Pan was there, and Faunus too, All the romping sylvan crew, Nature's Mænads flocking mad From the City dark and sad, Finding once again the free Sunshine and its jollity! Phillis smiled and leapt for joy, I was gamesome as a boy; Gaily twang'd the fiddle-string, Men and maids played kiss-in-ring, Fountains leapt against the sun, Roses bloom'd and children played, All the world was full of fun, Lovers cuddled in the shade! What though God was proved to be Paradox and fantasy? What though Christ had ceased to stir From his lonely selpulchre? ‘If the Trinity be dead, Pagan gods are still alive! Fast they come to-day,’ I said, ‘Thick as bees from out a hive! Pan is here, with all his train Flocking out of street and lane; Flora in a cotton gown Ties her garter stooping down; Town-bred Sylvan plump and fat Weareth lilac in his hat; Faun and satyr laughing pass, Hither and thither Venus roams, Gay Bacchantes on the grass Laughingly adjust their combs!— Phillis, all the world is gay In the merry, merry May!’ ‘O who will worship the great god Pan At Hampton Court with me?’ She cried, and unto the Maze we ran Laughing so merrily. ‘The sun is bright, and the music plays, And all is May,’ sang she: And I caught my love in the heart of the Maze With kisses three times three. Down the chestnut colonnades Full of freckled light and shades, Soon we saw the dappled deer, Pricking hairy tail and ear, Stand like Fauns with still brown eyes Looking on us as we came. Faint behind us grew the cries, Merry music and acclaim, Till we found beneath a tree All the peace of Arcady. Lying there, where green boughs spread Curtains soft against the sky, While the stock-dove far o'erhead Pass'd with solitary cry, Now and then we look'd around Listening, till distinct and clear Came the cuckoo's call profound From some happy Dreamland near! Happy as a heart of gold Shook the sunshine everywhere, Throbbing pulses manifold Through the warmly panting air; On the leaves and o'er the grass Living things were thronging bright, 'Neath a sky as clear as glass Flashing rays of life and light. All things gladden'd 'neath the blue, While we kiss'd and gladden'd too. ‘Praised be golden Pan,’ I said, ‘All the duller gods are dead; But the wood-god wakes to-day In the merry, merry May!’ ‘O who will worship the great god Pan?’ I cried as I clasped you, dear; ‘Form of a faun and soul of a man, He plays for the world to hear; Sweetly he pipeth beneath the skies, For a brave old god is he!’ O I kissed my love on the lips and eyes! And O my love kissed me! Slowly, softly, westward flew Day on wings of gold and blue; As she faded out of sight Dark and balmy fell the night. Silent 'neath the azure cope, Earth, a naked Ethiope, Reach'd black arms up through the air, Dragging down the branches bright Of the flowering heavens, where Starry fruitage glimmer'd white! As he drew them gently near, Dewdrops dim and crystal clear Rain'd upon his face and eyes! Listening, watching, we could hear His deep breathing 'neath the skies;— Suddenly, far down the glade, Startled from some place of shade, Like an antelope the dim Moon upsprang, and looked at him! Panting, trembling, in the dark, Paused to listen and to mark, Then with shimmer dimly fair On from shade to shade did spring, Gain'd the fields of heaven, and there Wander'd, calmly pasturing! ‘O who will worship the great god Pan Out in the woods with me? Maker and lover of woman and man, Under the stars sings he; And Dian the huntress with all her train Awakes to the wood-notes wild!’ O I kissed my love on the lips again, And Dian looked down and smiled. Hand in hand without a care Following the Huntress fair, Wheresoe'er we went we found Silver footprints on the ground: Grass and flowers kept the shine Of the naked feet divine. Now and then our eyes could see, As we softly crept along Through the dusky greenery, Glimmers of the vestal throng— Locks of gold and limbs of snow Fading on as we came near, Faint soft cries and laughter low Ceasing as we paused to hear! O the night more sweet than day! O the merry, merry May! O the rapture dark and deep Of the woodlands hush'd to sleep! O the old sweet human tune Pan is piping to the moon! ‘Though the systems wax and wane, Thou and I,’ he sings, ‘remain— Both by night and one by day Witch a world the old warm way! Foot it, foot it! Where you tread Woods are greenly carpeted. Foot it round me as I sing Nymphs and satyrs in a ring! ‘Gnarled and old sits the great god Pan— (Peep through the boughs, and see!)— He plays on his pipes Arcadian Under the dark oak-tree. But the boughs are dark round his sightless eyes— And Dian, where is she; O follow, follow, and where she flies Follow her flight with me!’ Slowly, dreamily, we crept From the silent sleeping park, Join'd the merry throng that swept Townward through the summer dark. Shining round our path again, Dian flash'd before the train, In upon our comrades shone, Smiled and beckon'd, bounding on! Satyrs brown in corduroys Smoked their pipes and join'd in song; Gamesome girls and merry boys Fondled as we swept along; Here a flush'd Bacchante prest Heavy head and crumpled bonnet On her drowsy lover's breast, Sprawling drowsily upon it; Flush'd from dancing sports of Pan Sat the little artizan, With his wife and children three, And the baby on his knee; Here a little milliner, Smart in silk and shape-improver, All the happy Spring astir In her veins, sat by her lover; Mounted somewhere on the train, Pan on the accordion played! Rough feet shuffled to the strain, Happy hearts the spell obeyed; While fair Dian, looking in, Saw the throng and heard the din, Touch'd the young heads and the grey With the magic of the May! ‘O who will worship the great god Pan, Where life runs wild and free? Form of a faun and soul of a man, He playeth eternallie. And Dian is out on the azure waste As bright as bright can be!’ O my arm embraced my love's small waist, And my love crept close to me! When we reached the streets of stone Dian there was bright before us, Wading naked and alone In the pools of heaven o'er us! Fainter came the wood-god's sound As we crossed the Bridge, and there Saw the City splendour-crown'd Sleeping dark in silver air; Saw the river dark beneath Rippling dim to Dian's breath. Phillis nestling to my side Watch'd the sad street-walker pass, Hollow-voiced and weary-eyed, Painted underneath the gas. Paler, sadder, looked the moon, Sadder grew the old sweet tune; Shapes of sorrow and despair Flitted ghostwise in the air, And among them, wan and slow, Stalked the spectral Shape of Woe— Piercèd hands and piercèd feet Passing on from street to street; Silently behind Him crept Pallid Magdalens who wept! All the world at His footfall Darken'd, and the music ceased— Dark and sacrificial Loom'd the altars of the priest, All the magic died away And the music of the May. ‘O who will worship the great god Pan Here in the streets with me? Sad and tearjul and weary and wan Is the god who died on the Tree; But Pan is under and Dian above, Though the dead god cannot see, And the merry music of youth and love Returns eternallie!’ Homeward went my love and I To our lodging near the sky; There beside the snow-white bed Dian stood with radiant eyes! Smiled a moment ere she fled— Then, with halo round her head, Hung above us in the skies! By the casement open wide Long we watch'd her side by side; While from the dark streets around Came again the sylvan sound— Pan was softly piping there As he pipes in field and grove, Conquering sorrow and despair With the strains of life and love! Phillis in her bedgown white Kissed me, standing in the moon; Louder, sweeter, through the night Rang the olden antique tune; Gently on my knee I drew her Smiling as I heard her say, All her warm life kindling through her, ‘Dearest, what a happy day!’ ‘'Tis a happy world,’ I said; ‘Pan still pipes, though Christ is dead!’ Blushing he ceased, and folded up the scroll, While Sappho Syntax through her spectacles Looked grave as Pallas, and the Graces hung Their pink-white cheeks and titter'd among their curls. Dan Paumanok the Yankee pantheist Was first to speak; quoth he, ‘I like that song! It suits me, it tastes pleasant in the mouth; But Christ is just as much alive as Pan, Not less or more; and for the Magdalen, I guess she suits me too. I beckon her To an appointment, and she smiling comes: The paint upon her lips is just as good As roses, and her loose wild dress surpasses The lily's raiment—’ He was talking on, When Douglas interposed—‘May I suggest The moral of the ditty? It is here: The joys of costermongers and their wenches, Of poets and their sweethearts, vindicate Nature's loose morals and the primal Fall. Eat, drink, be merry—carpe diem—since Man is a Satyr; half a beast at best, When wholly so, most happy! Am I right, Madonna?’ This to Lady Barbara, Who sat with pensive cheek upon her hand, Her bright eyes tender with some summer dream. ‘Nay, Fool!’ she sighed; and ‘Nay,’ cried Verity, With delicate nostril breathing vestal fire, ‘The passionate eternal purity, Bright Artemis, who walks the fields of night And trims with lustrous hands the lamps of heaven, Rebukes the eternal riot of the sense! Woe to the land wherein the Satyr reigns, And Pan usurps Apollo's ivory throne! Thank God we Englishmen at last have heard, Amidst the pagan orgy and the shame Of yonder City, Nature's warning voice Of Earthquake,—with the wine-cup raised to drink, Have read the handwriting on the riven wall In characters of His eternal fire!’ ‘Superfluous was the warning,’ interposed Wormwood, the pessimist philosopher; ‘Man needs no miracle to attest the law Which made him and preserves him miserable! Like fabled Tantalus in the poet's song, In aquis quœrit aquas, and pursues The ever-flying apple. Let him gladden A little in the sunshine if he can— To-morrow he must die!’ ‘Man cannot die!’ Shrill'd the sleek pantheist, Spinoza Smith; ‘For though the individual perishes, The sum Divine, cipher of which Man is, Abides imperishable. Thought alone Is God, and is the only Absolute; And Thought remains though men and systems fade. The music lasts, the instrument is changed: Thought was, is, and shall be; Thought has at last Become material in Humanity. The consciousness of the Eternal flames Upon the mirror of thy consciousness, And for a moment while the splendour lasts Thou knowest and perceivest. Die, and lo! The light that was and is thy consciousness Abides divine and indestructible,— Invisible, with power to re-emerge In forms material, other instruments, In forms and hues which figure Thought divine; Yea, even letters, which like hieroglyphs Preserve the eternal attributes of Soul. Thus man is God, and therefore cannot die.’ Quoth Paumanok dryly, ‘What you say is true, But with interpretations! Man emerges From the Divine Idea, to gain, not lose, Identity, and once identified I guess he cannot once again retire Impersonal; having become as God By knowing and perceiving, he remains Godlike, immortal, and has vanquish'd Death!’ ‘We wander,’ said Queen Barbara with a smile, ‘Far from our starting-place. Great Rome still stands Upon the solid ground, the mighty rock; Philosophy with heavy and weary wing Still seeks to rise, but flaps along the ground; And poets' dreams of fairyland and gods Are fantasies too faint for flesh and blood.’ Then Cuthbert spoke, our Modern Abelard— The Church's outcast, foe of all the creeds, But most at war with his own unbelief, A priest at heart, yet scorning every form Of priesthood, dim-eyed through excess of light, Believing nought, believing everything, And groping through his doubts he knew not whither. ‘Rome conquer'd where she crown'd the hopes of man With a celestial promise, but she failed Where the old pagan triumphed—in a joy Material, archetypal, quick not dead, That met the happy needs of human life. We are mortal and immortal; mortal first, Women and men, although eternal souls; And warring with the laws of life and love, Rejecting flesh which symbolises God, Blind to the law of Nature, seeing not Thought and material are but woof and web, Scorning the animal instinct and its pleas For sunshine and free light, free exercise Of life and breath, Rome turned the world she ruled Into a lazar-den and sepulchre. She proved Man cannot die, but failed to prove That Man is fit to live; she comforted The grief of Man, but caused the tears she dried; She slew the idolatries of heathendom, But made an image of the living God, And lapsed, as all idolaters must lapse, To darkness and despair. Yet she endures,— The blind old Mother, grovelling on the ground In purple sad as sackcloth, and the world Still sees the sceptre that is but a reed Shake in her palsied hand. Too weary and old To learn the lesson that the infant Man Is prattling at her knee, she lieth prone, And measures—her own grave!’ So saying, he turned To one who stood and listened at his side— Sparkle, Professor of the Institute,— A tall lithe man, brown as a mountaineer, Who through a glittering eyeglass, the bright pane Fix'd in his intellectual dwelling-house, Half study, half observatory, gazed Serenely on the follies of the world. ‘Right, right, dear Cuthbert,’ answering his look, Sparkle replied: ‘and yet, and yet—who knows? I have often thought with Comte that fallen Rome Might yet arise, if she would cast aside Her supernatural fancies and baptize Us wandering priests of Science, fashioning A truly nobler order of the Wise To rule the world and spread the solemn creed Of Nature and the Law. She wastes her life Mourning her Eldest Born, that beauteous soul Who ere He perish'd, centuries ago, Promised so wonderfully that the world Is haunted by His memory even now! Well, that is o'er, the golden bowl is broken, The fair head still, within its Eastern grave; But we who have come upon a stormier time, The apostles of a sterner, saner creed, Would gladly wake the Mother from her dream And seat her on the throne of human thought. Man craves a creed—we bring it; seeks a rule Imperial,—she might wield it as of old; Demands a priesthood,—we who follow Truth, Far as the limits of the Knowable, Would form that priesthood,—ay, and cheerfully Elect our Pope and give him ample power, Scarce stopping at infallibility! 'Tis sad so perfect a machinery Should rust away dishonoured and disused For lack of all it needs—a Hierarchy Which might restore it for the use of men!’ Two priests of Rome, outcast, yet still of Rome (Since he who once hath ta'en the priestly garb Is ever a priest), were in that company: Both smiled, but neither answer'd; silent men, With eyes that seem'd to suffer from the light They shed on others, even there, amid That throng of shallow or rebellious souls, They both were busy sowing subtle seeds That sprout by midnight. Well they knew, in sooth, How oft the pathos of a creed forlorn Acts magnet-like on sympathetic clay Sighing without a foothold. What had grown In pain and persecution still (they prayed), After long centuries of pomp and pride Might, under persecution, rise again. Their patient faces touch'd a piteous chord Within me: and as wistfully they watched The sunset fading like a blackening brand, Both speechless, faintly flush'd with that sad light, While Lady Barbara stirred upon her seat, Signing dismissal to her wearied court Whose yawns proclaim'd the dinner-hour at hand, I craved again the singer's privilege And sang of Roman Rizpah's last despair: O Rizpah, Mother of Nations, the days of whose glory are done, Moaning alone in the darkness, thou countest—the bones of thy Son! The Cross is vacant above thee, and He is no longer thereon— A wind came out of the night, and He fell like a leaf, and was gone. But wearily through the ages, searching the sands of the years, Thou didst gather His bones together, and wash them, Madonna, with tears. They have taken thy crown, O Rizpah, and driven thee forth with the swine, But the bones of thy Son they have left thee; yea, kiss them and clasp—they are thine! Thou canst not piece them together, or hang them up yonder afresh, The skull hath no eye within it, the feet and the hands are not flesh. Thou moanest an old incantation, thou troublest the world with thy cries— Ah God, if the bones should hear thee, and join once again, and arise! In the night of the seven-hill'd City, discrown'd and disrobed and undone, Thou waitest a sign, O Madonna, and countest the bones of thy Son! THE SECOND DAY. (ANTHROPOMORPHISM.) Two miles of field and wood as flies the crow, But thrice two miles of azure curves and bends As winds the peaceful river, turning oft With lingering feet as turns and turns again On her own footprints some sweet dreaming maid Who gathers ferns and flowers with listless hand, Lay like a jewel a green promontory Sparkling bright emerald on the breast of Tweed. Thither next day our happy company In barges, boats, and shallops idly rowed, A bright flotilla, all the rainbow's hues Fluttering in sunshine and in azure depths Brokenly mirror'd; Satyrs, Nymphs, and Fauns, The Graces under pink silk parasols, The Muses under Gainsborough hats of straw, Venus, white-vestured and without her doves, Chattering to Vulcan in blue spectacles, The modern Syrens, singing as they dipt White hands in crystal o'er the shallop's side, Followed each other merrily as we went. And here the willow trailed her yellow locks In golden shallows whence the kingfisher Flashed like a living topaz and was gone; And here the clustering water-lilies spread Their oilèd leaves and alabaster cups, Tangled amid the river's sedgy hair; And there from shadowy oaks that fringed the stream The squirrel stood upright and lookt at us With beaded eyes; and all the flowery banks Were loud with hum of bees and song of birds; And often on the smooth and silent pools, Brimful of golden warmth and heavenly light, The salmon sprang a foot into the sun, Sparkled in panoply of silver mail, And sank in the circle of his own bright leap! For on the promontory which we sought A Hermit in the olden time had dwelt, White-hair'd, white-bearded, cress and pulse his food, The crystal stream his drink; and still the rock Preserved the outline of his mossy cell; And where his naked foot had press'd the grass Under the shadowy boughs of oak and beech, The blue of heaven had fallen and blossom'd up In azure harebells multitudinous, For ever misted with their own soft breath Of sunless summer dew. Gaily we sailed, And after many windings serpentine We reached the place. Against the grassy banks Our boats discharged their many-coloured freight, Till all the flowery slopes and dusky glades Were busy and bright with smiling human shapes; And through the warm and honeysuckled ways, Tangled with bramble, ferns, and foxglove bells, We pushed our path until we found indeed The mossy cell, with overhanging eaves Encalendured with lichens like the Cross, And down below the dewy grass, knee-deep, And countless hyacinths with their waxen stems And fairy bells of thin transparent blue. Most cool and still, embower'd on every side, With just a peep of azure overhead, Was that sweet sanctuary, hush'd as a nest Deserted, with no stir of summer sound; And down the mossy rock a crystal dew Stole coldly, while one sparkling minute drop Fell like quicksilver on a flowering fern, Gleam'd, and rolled luminous to the chill green ground. Hard by the cell we found an open lawn Sprinkled with fronds of fern and azure flowers, And here full soon we spread our snowy cloths And picnick'd in the sunlight. From the boughs The gold-bill'd blackbird and the bluewing'd jay Gazed down on such a scene as birds beheld When Oberon's enchanted cavaliers Stole forth to banquet underneath the moon; And they whose scientific bolts and brooms Had driven the fairies forth from field and farm, So that the shepherdess and dairymaid No longer fear the roguish pixy's thumb Punishing idleness, were merriest there, And laughed as loud as if the work-a-day world Were sweetly haunted yet! In lily hands The light glass tinkled, while the beaded wine Cream'd and ran o'er, and every learnèd lap Was like a Dryad's, full of ripen'd fruit; And presently for sport our Satyrs plucked Flowers of the wood, and pelted merrily Some saucy-eyed Bacchantes, who upsprang White-bosom'd, dimple-breasted, and escaped Hotly pursued into the flowery glades— Whence silvery peals of laughter, stifled cries, Were wafted to us on the summer air. Then to her throne, a high and mossy bank Emblazon'd with the crowsfoot's dusky gold, Our Barbara moved, with royally lifted hand Enjoining silence; happily her court Clustered about her, as she smiled and cried— ‘Surround me and attend, all ye whose souls, Though glad with summer light and warm with milk Of Venus (which we moderns call champagne!) Remember that Great Problem, and our oath Each day to take it as a summer theme. Here on this very spot, in yonder cell, The holy Hermit dwelt and ponder'd it Alone, so many a hundred years ago. Alas! how few in this our feverish age Dare play the hermit now! Our anchorites Are noisy men, who tell their beads for show, And print their prosings in the magazines Beside the gigman's diatribes at “God,” Spelt with a little “g”!’ A quiet voice, That of a bright-eyed preacher from the north— (Our Norman, ripe and mellow as Friar Tuck, Yet tender-soul'd as sweet Maid Marian!)— Made echo:—‘Wisely spoken! Here and there A few sad thinkers crawl on hands and knees Into the temples of the solitude; But these, being reverent, are awed and dumb,— Unlike the jaunty, dapper, newly breech'd Child of the age, who, strutting in the sun Selling his birthright for a penman's praise, Denies his Heavenly Father!’ ‘Pardon me,’ Broke in the scoffer, Douglas Sutherland, ‘The age we live in has its vanities I grant you, but it stands supreme in this,— The use of soap and water, the crusade Still needful against other-worldliness. If holiness be gauged by length of nail, Heart's purity by epidermic crust, I grant your anchorites were blessed men; If not, quite otherwise; and for the rest, The Heavenly Father they perceived and praised, Their magnified non-natural Heavenly Father, Was, like themselves, a dull old Anchorite, Unclean and useless, brooding in a den With Fever for his servant, Pestilence To scatter forth his breathings. Nowadays We prize a cleanlier Godhead, scorning dreams Which at the best are childish,—in a word, Anthropomorphic!’ Then that other's face, A little angry, for a burning soul With faith at white heat cannot jest with fire, Flash'd scornfully and almost pityingly— ‘The babe must have his rattle, and the child His catchword! Verily, Science is at best A foolish Virgin, thinking to destroy The Eternal Verity with a cumbrous phrase! Anthropomorphic, say you, is the dream,— A man's, an infant's, vision of himself Flashed upon mental darkness? Be it so. Then as a child that in the cradle lies And feels the darkness stir, and seems to feel The brightness of a face he cannot see, I, who am old, accept the happy dream, And, since you will it so, the phrase as well. Go, range the empty heaven of fantasy Upon Spinoza's wingèd horse of brass (Which, coming down to earth with thundershock, Stuns him that rides and robs him of an eye), Or lose your wits in Hegel's cloud of words, Or prone on hands and knees inspect the worms With Darwin, or with Spencer blankly stare At vacuum and the Inconceivable; But what if, like those leaders, lonely men, You find yourselves at last without a Friend? Meantime I stretch a hand out in the darkness And touch—my Father's; nay, I wake and gaze, And lo! I see the very Face and Form I have dream'd of; and, a child once more, I say “Our Father,” and I know my prayer is heard! God help me if my God be not indeed The Father of my simple childish faith!’ Then Douglas shrugged his shoulders, scorning speech With one in Superstition's swaddling clothes; But something in the brave benignant face, Bright-eyed and lofty-brow'd, and in the voice So tender with its soft deep Highland burr, Subdued us, and we listened reverently Ev'n where we doubted most; and when he ceased A certain timid echo in our hearts Murmur'd approval. Thereupon our Queen Besought him, having faith so absolute, To carry our fitful torch of tale-telling A little space that day, 'then hand it on To the next, and next. He shook his head and smiled, Then answer'd, being urged—‘To me at least Your Problem is no Problem after all— I solved it at my Heavenly Father's knee, Spelling His Name out of the Book Divine, And looking up into those loving eyes With which He shines upon the worst and best; But since you wish it, I will tell a tale Of that same heavenly Presence—how it came To one who was in heart a little child, But who, being lesson'd by the over-wise, Beheld the gentle dream dissolve away.’ Then, without further prelude, he began This story of the monk Serapion, Who in the evening of his days embraced The sweet anthropomorphic heresy. SERAPION. I. On the mountain heights, in a cell of stone, Dwelt Serapion; There, winter and summer, he linger'd alone. Most drear was the mountain and dismal the cell; Yet he loved them well— Contented and glad in their silence to dwell. And ever his face wore an innocent ray, And his spirit was gay, And he sang, like the angels who sing far away! The goathered, who gathered his flocks ere the night, In the red sunset light, Heard the voice ring above him, from height on to height. Ofttimes, from his cell on the cold mountain's crown, He came merrily down, And stood, with a smile, 'mid the folk in the town. With raiment all ragged, worn shoon on his feet, He walk'd in the street, Yet his eyes were so happy, his voice was so sweet! And ever his face wore the grace and the gleam Of a beautiful dream, Like the light of the sun shed asleep on a stream! And the folk cried aloud, as they gathered to see: ‘Of all men that be, The brightest and happiest surely is he!’ And they question'd: ‘O! why is thy face ever bright, And thy spirit so light, Down here in the valley, up there on the height?’ He answer'd: ‘What makes me so happy and gay Wheresoever I stray? The Lord I behold all the night, all the day! ‘He walks like a Shepherd in raiment of gold On the mountain-tops cold; He comes to my cell; on my knees I behold. ‘He smiles like my father who died long ago; His eyes sweetly glow— Those eyes are as sapphires; His beard is as snow! ‘Yea, night-time and day-time he comes to my call, The dear Father of all, With a face ever fair, with a solemn footfall!’ Then the folk cried again: ‘Of all mortals that be, Surely gladdest is he!’ . . . . Wise monks from afar came to hear and to see. II. As they climb'd through the snows to his cell, they could hear His voice ringing clear, In a hymn to the Lord who for ever seem'd near. They enter'd and saw him. He sat like a wight Who beholds some strange sight— Face fix'd, his eyes shining, most peaceful and bright! ‘O brother! what makes thee so happy?’ they cried. With a smile he replied: ‘The Lord who so loves me, my Guardian and Guide! ‘He comes in the night and He comes in the day From his Heaven far away; I feel His soft touch on my hair, as I pray. ‘He smiles with grave eyes like my father long dead, His hand bows my head, From the breath of His nostrils a blessing is shed!’ Through their ranks as they listened a cold shudder ran, And the murmur began: ‘Can God have the touch and the breath of a man? ‘No soul can conceive Him, no sight may descry The Most Strange, the Most High, Not the quick when they live, not the holy who die.’ But Serapion answer'd: ‘I hear and I see; He comes hourly to me; He speaks in mine ear, as I pray on my knee!’ They murmur'd: ‘Blaspheme not! He dwells far away; None fathom Him may; For He is not as man, nor is fashion'd of clay. ‘Can the God we conceive not have ears and have eyes? Who sayeth so, lies! Cast thy heresy off, hear our words, and be wise! ‘For God is not flesh, as His worshippers be— Nay, a Spirit is He, Not shapen for mortals to hear or to see. ‘Inconceivable, Holy, Divine evermore, All His works ruling o'er; Yet by these we conceive Him, and darkly adore.’ Then Serapion answer'd: ‘How strange! For He seems, In my beautiful dreams, To be near, with a kind face that brightens and beams!’ They murmur'd: ‘These fancies are false and abhorred; Since the God who is Lord Neither face hath nor form, though His wrath is a sword! ‘Put the vision behind thee! Be sure no man's eye Can conceive or descry What is hidden from angels of God in the sky!’ But Serapion answer'd: ‘He comes to my prayer: He is kind, He is fair; His smile is as sunlight, that sleeps on the air. ‘Not as men, but more splendid and stately and tall Is the Father of all. He walks on the snows with a solemn footfall!’ But they cried: ‘By some fiend is thy solitude stirred! Shall the Light and the Word, The Spirit Almighty, be seen and be heard? ‘Put the vision aside; like a dream let it flit, And the shadow of it; Lest the heresy drive thee, accurst, to the Pit.’ They spake and he listened. For nights and for days He hark'd in amaze, While they proved that a Phantom had gladden'd his gaze. At last all was clear, and his forehead was bent In submissive assent. They confess'd him and bless'd him, and joyfully went. III. There he sat, still as stone, sadly thinking it o'er, At his desolate door. Then, alone in his cell, tried to pray, as before. He reached out his arms to the cold, empty air, Kneeling woefully there; He prayed unto God; but none came to his prayer. He walked from his cell on the cold mountain's crown, Wending silently down, Till he stood as before, 'mid the folk in the town. With raiment all ragged, worn shoon on his feet, He stood in the street; And his eyes were not happy, his voice was not sweet! The gladness was gone that made golden his face; Yea, there linger'd no trace Of the smile and the sunshine, the peace and the grace. And the folk whisper'd low, as they gathered to see— ‘Of all men that be, The saddest and weariest surely is he!’ He climb'd up the mountain, and sat there alone; And his spirit made moan— ‘My God, they have slain Thee! My God, Thou art gone! ‘Their breath hath destroy'd Thee, my Father!’ he said— ‘Thou art lost! Thou art fled!’ And the sense of his doom was as dust on his head. IV. The goatherd still gather'd his flocks ere the night, In the red sunset-light; But heard no voice singing, afar on the height! Silent we cluster'd when the tale was done, Till Verity exclaimed: ‘As that lone monk Who suffered pedants to destroy his God, So is our England now! For many years She dwelt apart and ponder'd that pure thought Which turned to heavenly song in Milton's mouth, And never questioning taught her wisest sons To bow their heads beneath the Father's hand; Then in an evil hour her ear was turn'd To specious pleadings which profaned the faith And quickened unbelieving; from that hour Faith faded, the heroic stature sank Cubit by cubit, and her heroes changed To problem-haunted pigmies, clustering mites On the green cheese of Science. Faugh, how rank The stale thing smells, to nostrils which have drunk The pure air sweeten'd by the mountain snows Where men even yet may find the living God!’ Cried Sparkle quickly, ‘I will grant you, Faith Was marvellous, when Faith was possible! But which is best for outcast Nature's Son, Fatherless, illegitimately born, And at the best remitted to the care Of an abandon'd mother—which is best, To play the farce of filial faith to One Who utterly declines to show His face, Nay, who, if He exists, denies Himself, And leaves His offspring unprovided for, Or boldly, calmly, facing all events, To say, “In all the world where'er I search I find no trace of Fatherhood at all, No token of His kindness or His care,— Only inexorable Law pursuing Me and my brethren, and that greater one, Nature, our mother. Blessings upon her, Upon her poor blind eyes and beauteous face Still sunny with insufferable love! Blessings upon her, and sweet reverence, Who loveth us, her children! On her breast We wakened, ever in her circling arms We found kind shelter; when our hearts are sore, Our spirits weary, she can comfort us With countless ministrations, woven smiles Of light and flowers and sunshine; when at last We are wearied out with our brief day of life, She hath a bed of quiet ready, strewn With grass and scented shadow. Bid me kneel To her who never fail'd in acts of love, And lo! how eagerly, how reverently, I haste to bend the knee; but bid me kneel To Him I know not, who since life began Hath never stood acknowledged or revealed, And lo! I rise erect with folded arms In the full pride and privilege of Man, Rejecting, scorning, or denying Him! How hath He helped me? When my finger ached Or my soul sicken'd of some dark disease, Where was my Father—where was He for whom I shriek'd through all the watches of the night In pain and protestation? Did He come To comfort and sustain me? When I shrank Affrighted from the clammy hands of Death, When in mine arms the maiden of my love Lay dead and cold, slain by her own first kiss, Where was the Father that ye vaunt so much? I owe Him life? Perchance. Love too? Ah me, A little love to mock a little life Forlorn, and swiftly flying! He hath chosen, To leave me in the wilderness of thought Abandon'd and rejected; I in turn, Finding He fails me in my hour of need, Finding He cannot save me from the fangs Of His own bloodhounds, Death and Force and Law, Reject Him, and abandon that old dream Of ever looking on a Father's face!”’ More would his lips have utter'd in a strain By some deemed blasphemous, but angry cries Broke in upon the current of his speech; And many there, remembering the fear Which drove them thither from the City's streets, Drew timorously together, as if fearing The Earthquake's jaws might open under them. ‘Enough!’ cried Barbara—‘you touch the harp Of feeling with too strenuous a touch, And jar the delicate chords too cruelly! For me, I mourn the faith which long ago Led men into the desert sands to pray, And tomb'd the hermit in his narrow cell; Then love was pain, and pain was privilege, And he who sought the Father was content To find Him bleeding on the wayside Cross, Or looking sadly from the Sepulchre. Now who will justify the holiness Of self-renouncement, shaming with some tale, Quaint as a missal love-illuminèd, Our peevish problem-haunted modernness? Come, Bishop, for you have not spoken yet, Though clad in wisdom and in purity As whitely as your ancestors, the monks.’ Close to her side stood Bishop Eglantine, The gentle priest who dwells an anchorite Amid the busiest throngs of living men— A man who, sitting at the laden board Of Knowledge, looking with a longing eye On the rare dainties that he must not touch, Grows gaunt and lean with intellectual fasts; So spare, the soul seems shining through his flesh Like light through alabaster. Tall he stood, Upgazing through the thin transparent roof Of leaves upon some peaceful sight in heaven, And when he smiled in answer to her words His smile was spectre-like and virginal, Too faint for flesh and blood. Not far away The plumper Bishop Primrose laughing sat, Broad as his Church and sunnier than his creed, And held a bright-eyed child between his knees. A Roman lily and an English rose Were these two prelates; one proclaiming Christ Ghostly and sad and sacrificial, The other, Christ the brown young Shepherd, clad With strength as with a garment, bending down To lift a lambkin struggling among thorns, And bear it on his back across the hills Into the Master's fold. Quoth Eglantine, With courteous bow to all the circle round, ‘Ev'n as you spoke my thoughts were far away With one who tenderly renounced the flesh And found in pain sweet comfort long ago. Here is the tale—scarcely indeed a tale— 'Tis given in a monkish chronicle, And is so brief, that he who runs may hear.’ RAMON MONAT. 1 Hidden from the light of day, All his care to plead and pray, In his cell sat Ramon Monat, Gaunt and grey. 2 Suddenly before his sight Stood the Virgin robed in white,— In her arms fresh-gather'd roses Red and bright. 3 ‘Ramon, Ramon,’ murmur'd she, ‘See the gifts I bring to thee, Roses, red celestial roses, Pluck'd by me! 4 ‘Walking in His gardens fair, 'Midst the golden glory there, My sweet Son, the Lord Christ Jesus, Hears thy prayer! 5 ‘Lo, He sendeth thee to-day These blest flowers from far away!’ . . . Wildly sobbing, Ramon Monat Answer'd ‘Nay! 6 'Holy Mother, on thy breast Let the flowers of rapture rest,— Not for me—I am not worthy— Gifts so blest! 7 'Ah, but if my brows might gain (Hear me, though the prayer is vain), For a moment's space, my Master's Crown of pain!’ 8 From his sight the Virgin fair Vanish'd, as he sank in prayer; Presently, again he saw her, Standing there! 9 Weeping bitterly she said, ‘See, the gift I bring instead— Lo, the cruel crown of sorrow, Bloody-red!’ 10 When the Virgin Mother mild, Weeping like a little child, Set the thorns on Ramon's forehead, Ramon smiled! 11 Lonely there for many a day, Rack'd with anguish, gaunt and grey, Happy with that crown of sorrow, Ramon lay. 12 Then, when 'twas his Master's will, There they found him dead and chill, Sweetly, in his crown of sorrow, Smiling still! ‘The lunatic, the anchorite, and the poet Are of rank superstition all compact,’ Cried Douglas, lifting high his cap and bells; ‘Your Ramon Monat wore his crown of thorns Upon his pallid brow as jauntily As Cæsar throws the purple round his limbs. Such creatures on the body of Mother Church Crawl'd thickly, till good Doctor Rational, Call'd when the lady's state was perilous, Said, “Wash thyself—be clean, take exercise!” And so the vermin died. He serves God best Who loves his kind, and teaches them to rinse Both soul and body, until both appear As clean—as a sheep's heart!’ A speech so bold Jarr'd with the gentle temper of the hour, The peaceful woods, the summer afternoon, The dreamy spirit of that sylvan scene. ‘Peace, knave!’ cried Barbara mock-seriously, ‘Moments there are when even cap and bells Must lose their privilege, and fools be dumb For fear of stripes!’—and to him on the grass She tossed a bunch of grapes, which Douglas caught And munch'd in silence, lying on his back. Then came a pause, so deep that we could hear The breathing of the silence, the soft stir Of birds among the boughs, the waterfall Crooning itself to sleep within the woods. Quoth Bishop Primrose: ‘Your ascetics shrank Sense after sense, until their very souls Became as mere Narcissi, pondering Their own reflections, figuring in their pride A moral catalepsy, death not life. He serves God best who launches fearlessly Out on the living waters, and proclaiming The great celestial haven, leads the way With all sails set, that the poor storm-toss'd fleet Of Humankind may follow fearlessly! Ev'n so the preachers of our Church have done, Spreading glad tidings up and down the world, And working out salvation for themselves Through the redemption of the human race!’ ‘Alas!’ another speaker interposed, ‘The Storm is loud for ever on the seas, And while the proud strong Churches of the creeds Sail to and fro with golden argosies, Each night a fleet of fishing-boats goes down And no man heeds! Science is tenderer; She puts a beacon on each rocky cape, And sounds the shallows, that poor mariners May know the seas their ships must navigate. Meantime the tumult of Euroclydon Roars on the Deep; and mark! the tempest blows Not to but from the far-off Heavenly Land, Beating the vessels back on dusky shores To shipwreck close at home. I'd rather trust The roughest pilot born upon the coast, Familiar with the dangers round about, Than any of your Priests who shut their eyes And wring their hands and pray! This world of ours Is at the mercy of the elements; Who tries to weigh them? Science does her best, While poor Religion quakes, and conjures up More spectres than the storm itself can breed.’ He added: ‘Just the other day in church, Drifted there Heaven knows how and Heaven knows why, I heard the preacher preach, and dreamed a dream; If you will have it, here it is in verse, Rude as the maker, rugged as the theme,’— And no one interposing, he began. IN A FASHIONABLE CHURCH. I. What Shape is this with hands outreaching, Walking the waters of Hell, and preaching? The waves are rolling beneath and glistening, Each breaking wave is a white face, listening! The rift is roaring, the rain is moaning— His robe streams back as He stands intoning; With jet-black troughs the mad seas break at Him, And the lightning springs, like a hissing snake, at Him! God, doth He guess any soul can hear Him, With the wind so wailing, the storm so near Him? Yet now and then sounds His voice of wonder there, Like the plash of a shower in the pause of thunder, there. The Devil sits by those waters evil, Pensive, as is the wont of the Devil, So bored and blasé his expression is None would guess what his true profession is. The waters and he are tired together Of such eternally stormy weather; Always that wind is roaring busily, Till the heart feels faint and the head rocks dizzily. Always gusty both night and morrow! No wonder the Devil is full of sorrow, No wonder he sneers at the Figure preaching there With bright eyes burning and hands outreaching there. The Devil thinks, ‘What use of trying To preach a sermon 'midst such a crying? If He bade the Almighty close His batteries, The damn'd beneath Him might guess what the matter is!’ And lo! the Figure with white robe streaming Raises His hand while the winds are screaming— As He stood on the earth when the Pharisees found Him, He stands, and the same Storm beats around Him. As long ago 'neath the empyrean He walked on the waters Galilean, With only the poor damn'd souls to discern it, He Walks, and has walked through a long eternity! God with the still small voice's calling! Soft as rain on the grass 'tis falling, Yet little blame to the souls who are near to it If they break and groan and give no ear to it! Something it is for the damn'd below Him To see the patient Figure and know Him! . . . . What a wind! what a raining and roaring now! Lightning, thunder, and black rain pouring now! II. Up with a start I waken groaning, And hear sweet Honeydew's voice intoning. Only a dream!—and in church I am again, Half asleep, in the midst of the sham again! Hark! how the soft-eyed, soft-voiced creature Preaches, with sweetness in every feature! The ladies listen, the maids sit dutiful, The spinsters quiver, and murmur, ‘Beautiful!’ Surely as every Sunday passes The scented silken superior classes Flutter flounces and flash like sunny dew Around the Reverend Mr. Honeydew. Cambric handkerchiefs scatter scent about, Pomaded heads are devoutly bent about, Silks are rustling, lips are muttering, To the dear man's emotional pausing and fluttering. The actor with his shaven cheek here Studies his art and learns to speak here; Every period properly weighted is, With gentle matter the sermon freighted is. Sir Midas, portly and resplendent, With the little Midases attendant, And Lady Midas, all eyes upon her here, Sit and smile in the pew of honour here. Even the agnostic and revolter Gather before this Chapel's altar, For none of the bigot's mad insanity Deforms dear Honeydew's Christianity. In such an excellent pastor's leading, So full of brightness and dainty breeding, Even the faith ecclesiastical Seems entertaining and less fantastical! The preacher is an excellent fellow! His matter and manner are ever mellow. . . . But afar the tempest of Hell is thundering, The Figure preaching, the Devil wondering! Strange as some low and far-off thunderpeal Heard in the still heat of a summer day, While shepherds looking upward in the sun See purple banks of cloud that ominously Roll in the distance, came the speaker's words; And as they ended we beheld indeed Hell, or Creation adumbrating Hell, Breathing with ululations of despair. Hearing the wails of sin, the moans of men, The hopeless, ceaseless wash of weary lives Which sigh for sunlight or some shore of peace, We pitied that supreme despairing Shape Who treads the waves of woe with luminous feet, And since He cannot still them, grows as sad As the wild waters He is walking on. And all were silent until Barbara rose And sigh'd: ‘The sun is sinking in the west; Our happy day is ended—let us go!’ And murmuring like bees around the queen We wandered slowly to the river-side. Now like a gentle herdsman stood the sun Pausing upon the brae-tops while he drove His fleecy flocks of cloud into their fold Beneath the faintly glimmering evening star; And coming from the shadow of the woods, Hushing our cries, we saw the gloaming grow, The trees behind us black, the prospects dim, But all things looming large in lustrous air, The river-pools as full of deep strange light As the still sky. The air, too, seem'd alive With ominous sound akin to that strange light: The bull-frogs croaking from the river shallows, The cat-owl calling from the distant glade, The murmuring waterfall now faintly heard Drowsy and half asleep. Then from the woods Rang sudden laughter, sharp and silvery clear, Of merry maidens, and the music seem'd As hollow as a bell, and when we spoke Our voices had an eerie and empty sound As if through vast and echoing corridors We walked in awe. But soon upon the stream Our bright flotilla homeward sailed again, And ere we reached the silent Priory woods The azure gates of darkness, swinging wide, Revealed the lucent starry-paven floors, And all the lamps of heaven ranged in rows Each in its order round the Altar-steps, From which a pale and silver-vestured Moon Pour'd bright ablution and upraised the Host. Then, as the glory wrapt us round and round, And the dark river, sparkling to our oars, Flash'd back the dewy splendour, soft and low Some voices joined in song; and thus they sang:— Storm in the night! and a voice in the Storm is crying: ‘They have taken my Lord, and I know not where He is lying!’ ‘I sat in the Tomb by His side, with a soul unshaken, I chafed His clay-cold hands,—for I knew He must waken. ‘Before He closed His eyes, He said to the weeping— “'Tis but a little while—I shall wake from sleeping!” Cold and stiff He lay, not seeing or hearing; The Tomb was sealed with a rock,—but I sat unfearing. ‘For a light lay on His eyes, and His face was gleaming; I heard Him sigh in His sleep, and thought “He is dreaming!” ‘And then, with a thunder-peal, the rock was riven; Bright, in the mouth of the Tomb, stood Angels of Heaven! ‘He did not stir, though I whispered, “Master, awaken!”. . Then brightness blinded my eyes,—and lo, He was taken! ‘I woke in the Tomb alone, and the wind chill'd through me: “O Master,” I moan'd, “remember Thy promise to me!” ‘I crept through the night and sought Him. . . . Hither and their The swift Moon walk'd, and the white-tooth'd Sea ran with her. ‘I stole from palace to palace, from prison to prison, I found no trace of my Lord, though they said “He hath risen!” ‘I heard the Nations weeping—I questioned the Nations: One said, “He is dead!” another, “He lives—have patience!” ‘Twice—on the desert sands, in the City Holy, I have found two piercèd footprints, vanishing slowly! ‘Wearily still I wander and still pursue Him— He promised and I await Him, wailing unto Him! ‘And now they say, “He is dead—hath the world forsaken.” Ah no, He hath promised!—hath waken'd,—or will awaken!’ Storm in the night! and a voice in the Storm still crying: ‘They have taken my Lord, and I know not where He is lying!’ THE THIRD DAY. (THIS WORLD.) Next day it storm'd. Awakening I gazed forth, And saw a slanting wall of liquid gray Shutting out park and pale, while overhead The black clouds droop'd their banners drifting east; Then gazing southward, through the mists I saw The ghostly glimmer of the distant Ocean! Desolate as a soul that leaps from heaven, The wild rain flung itself into the sea, And sobbing, choked and drown'd! The day drew on. Slowly at intervals, with dismal yawns, The guests descended to the breakfast-rooms, And afterwards they scatter'd hither and thither: Some to the drawing-room to lounge and flirt, Some to the billiard-room, whence soon there came The light sharp rattle of the ivory ball; Some to the library, others to the porch, To lounge there, pipe in mouth, and watch the weather. A few, with Sappho Syntax at their head, Donned their goloshes and their water-proofs, And faced the Storm; but many kept apart Until the lunch-bell rang; then, luncheon o'er, More straggling up and down from room to room, Till, as the hum spreads through a throng of bees That the queen bee is near, and straightway all Throng to the honey'd centre of the hive, The murmur spread that Barbara held her court In the great drawing-room; whither hastening, We found her, throned upon an ottoman, Sparkle, high priest of Science, at her side, And murmuring silken periods in her ear. ‘Dreary indeed, flat, dreary and confined, As this our Priory on a day of rain, With walls of liquid black on every side, Must the sad Earth have seemed ere Science rose To tear the veil from Nature's face, and show The wonders of the illimitable Void. A thousand years after the birth of Christ, Religion, like the Spirit of the Storm, Obscured the open heaven, veiled land and tide, And made Creation dark; and no man knew The clime wherein he dwelt, or dared explore His earthly habitation; but the tide Of Superstition, like another Flood, Submerged the landmarks, hid the continents, And mingled black with the unpastured Sea. Then, like a cumbrous Ark, the Church survived, And resting on the Ararat of Rome, Rock'd to the wash of waters—those within, Arrayed in priestly raiment, crying aloud, “Woe! woe to man! the Day of Doom is near!” Honour to those who in that awful hour Flew forth upon the waves like fearless doves, And though the craven priests cried out “Beware!” Faced the wild darkness and the winds of heaven, Seeking for glimpses of the solid land! Then some came circling back with wearied wings, And many vanished never to return; A few, the fleetest and most strong of flight, Returning after many wanderings, Brought with them, as the dove its olive branch, Tidings of gladness and a sunlit world!’ Then murmured Leslie Lambe with kindling cheeks, ‘Doves, say you? Doves? I' faith, it needed then The eagle's pinion and the eagle's eye To penetrate that melancholy waste. Think of Magellan! what an eagle, he!— The man of marble who in Hell's despite Unto his lonely purpose held unmoved, And sailing with unconquerable wing Across that blackness, came at last in sight Of a new Heaven sown with unknown stars, And underneath, a new and wondrous World. Stranger the problem he, the undaunted, solved Than all your problems of a world to come. Fie on your poets, fools of fantasy, That never one hath sung that hero's praise!’ Then I remember'd an old Song o' the Sea Put in the mouth of one who sailed the main With that stern captain, and within his arms Held him when, slain by poisonous darts, he died; The words, the rhyme, kept time within my brain Like wild sea-surges as the other spake; And when, with eager glance around, he ceased, I craved permission of our smiling Queen, And having quickly gained it, thus began:— THE VOYAGE OF MAGELLAN. (SPOKEN IN THE PERSON OF ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS, DYING AT HOME, YEARS AFTER THE WONDERFUL VOYAGE WAS OVER.) Send no shaven monks to shrive me, close the doors against their cries; Liars all! ay, rogues and liars, like the Father of all lies; Nay, but open wide the casement, once more let me feast my gaze On the glittering signs of Heaven, on the mighty Ocean-ways! Who's that knocking? Fra Ramiro? Left his wine-cup and arm-chair, Come again with book and ointment, to anoint me and prepare? Sacramento!—send him packing, with his comrades shaven-crown'd: Liars all! and prince of liars is their Pope! The world is round! See, the Ocean! like quicksilver, throbbing in the starry light! See the stars and constellations, strangely, mystically bright! Ah, but there, beyond our vision, other stars look brightly down, Other stars, and high among them, great Magellan's starry crown! O Magellan! lord and master!—mighty soul no Pope could tame! On the seas and on the heavens you have left your radiant name; Brightly shall it burn for ever, o'er the waters without bound, Proving Pope and Priests still liars, while the sun-kist world is round. Let the cowls at Salamanca cluster thick as rook and daw! Let the Pope, with right hand palsied, clutch his thunderbolts of straw! Heaven and Ocean, here and yonder, put their feeble dreams to shame; Earth is round, and high above it shines Magellan's starry name! Have you vanish'd, O my Master? O my Captain, King of men, Shall I never more behold you standing at the mast again, Eagle-eyed, and stern and silent, never sleeping or at rest, Pallid as a man of marble, ever looking to the west? As I lie and watch the heavens, once again I seem to be Out upon the waste of waters, sailing on from sea to sea. . . . Hark! what's that?—the monks intoning in the chapel close at hand? Nay, I hear but sea-birds screaming, round dark capes of lonely land. Out upon the still equator, on a sea without a breath, Burning, blistering in the sunlight, we are tossing sick to death; Every night the sun sinks crimson on the water's endless swell, Every dawn he rises golden, fiery as the flames of Hell. Seventy days our five brave vessels welter in the watery glare, O'er the bulwarks hang the seamen panting open-mouth'd for air; On the ‘Trinitie’ Magellan watches in a fierce unrest, Never doubting or despairing, ever looking to the west. Then at last with fire and thunder open cracks the sultry sky, While the surging seas roll under, swift before the blast we fly, Westward, ever westward, plunging, while the waters wash and wail; Nights and days drift past in darkness while we sail, and sail, and sail. Then the Tempest, like an eagle by a thunderbolt struck dead, With one last wild flap of pinions, droppeth spent and bloody-red, Purpling Heaven and Ocean lieth on the dark horizon's brink, While upon the decks we gather silently, and watch him sink. Troublously the Ocean labours in a last surcease of pain, While a soft breath blowing westward wafts us softly on the main,— Nearer to the edge of darkness where the flat earth ends, men swear, Where the dark abysses open, gulf on gulf of empty air! Creeping silently our vessels enter wastes of wondrous weed, Slimy growth that clings around them, tangle growing purple seed, Staining all the waste of waters, making isles of floating black, While the seamen, pointing fingers, shrink in dread, and cry, ‘Turn back!’ On the ‘Trinitie’ Magellan stands and looks with fearless eyes— ‘Fools, the world is round!’ he answers, ‘onward still our pathway lies; Though the gulfs of Hell yawn'd yonder, though the Earth were ended there, I would venture boldly forward, facing Death and Death's despair.’ On their knees they kneel unto him, cross themselves and shriek afraid, Pallid as a man of marble stands the Captain undismayed, Claps on sail and leads us onward, while the ships crawl in his track, Slowly, scarcely moving, trailing monstrous weeds that hold them back. On each vessel's prow a seaman stands and casts the sounding-lead, In the cage high up the foremast gather watchers sick with dread. Calmly on the poop Magellan marks the Heavens and marks the Sea, Darkness round and darkness o'er him, closing round the ‘Trinitie.’ Days and nights of deeper darkness follow—then there comes the cry, ‘He is mad—Death waits before us—turn the ships and let us fly!’ Storm of mutinous anger gathers round the Captain stern and true, Near the foremast, fiercely glaring, flash the faces of the crew. One there is, a savage seaman, gnashing teeth and waving hands, Strides with curses to the Captain where with folded arms he stands,— ‘Turn, thou madman, turn!’ he shrieketh—scarcely hath he spoke the word, Ere a bleeding log he falleth, slaughter'd by the Leader's sword! ‘Fools and cowards!’ cries Magellan, spurning him with armèd heel, ‘If another dreams of flying, let him speak—and taste my steel!’ Like caged tigers when the Tamer enters calmly, shrink the band, While the Master strides among them, cloth'd in mail and sword in hand. O Magellan! lord and leader!—only He whose fingers frame Twisted thews of pard or panther, knot them round their hearts of flame, Light the emeralds burning brightly in their eyeballs as they roll, Could have made that mightier marvel, thine inexorable soul! Onward, ever on, we falter—till there comes a dawn of Day Creeping ghostly up behind us, mirror'd faintly far away, While across the seas to starboard loometh strangely land or cloud— ‘Land to starboard!’ cries Magellan—‘Land!’ the seamen call aloud. Southward steering creep the vessels, while the lights of morning grow; Fades the land, while in our faces chilly fog and vapour blow; Colder grows the air, and clinging round the masts and stiffening sails Freezes into crystal dewdrops, into hanging icicles! Suddenly arise before us, phantom-wise, as in eclipse, Icebergs drifting on the Ocean like innumerable ships— In the light they flash prismatic as among their throng we creep, Crashing down to overwhelm us, thundering to the thund'rous Deep! Towering ghostly and gigantic, 'midst the steam of their own breath, Moving northward in procession in their snowy shrouds of Death, Rise the bergs, now overtoppling like great fountains in the air, While along their crumbling edges slips the seal and steals the bear. With the frost upon his armour, like a skeleton of steel, Stands the Master, waiting, watching, clad in cold from head to heel; Loud his voice rings through the vapours, ordering all and leading on, Till the bergs, before his finger, fall back ghostlike, and are gone! Once again before our vision sparkles Ocean wide and free, With the sun's red ball of crimson resting on the rim of sea;— ‘Lo, the sun!’ he laughs exulting—‘still he beckons far away— Earth is round, and on its circle evermore we chase the Day!’ As he speaks the sunset blackens. Twilight trembles through the skies For a moment—then the heavens open all their starry eyes! Suddenly strange Constellations flash from out the fields of blue— Not a star that we remember, not a splendour priestcraft knew! Sinking on his knee, Magellan prays: ‘Now glory be to God! To the Christ who led us forward on His wondrous watery road! See, the heavens give attestation that our search shall yet be crowned, Proving Pope and Priests still liars, and the sun-kist world is round!’ Sparkling ruby-ray'd and golden round the dusky neck of Night Hangs the jewel'd Constellation, strangely, mystically bright— Pointing at it cries the Master, ‘By the God we all adore, It shall bear my name, Magellan!’ and it bears it, evermore. Storms arising sweep us onward, but each night our courage grows, Newer portals of the Heavens seem to open and enclose, Showing in the blue abysm vistas luminously strange, Sphere on sphere, and far beyond them fainter lights that sparkle and change! Presently once more we falter among pools of drifting scum, Weed and tangle—o'er the blackness curious sea-birds go and come— While to southward looms a darkness, as of land or gathering cloud, Northward too, another darkness, and a sound of breakers loud. Once again they call in terror, ‘Turn again, for Death is near! Once again he quells their tumult, smiting till they crouch in fear. On the darkness closing round them, land or cloud, our fleet is led, Fighting tides that sweep them backward, flowing from some gulf of dread. Next, the Vision! next the Morning, after rayless nights and days, Twinkling on a great calm Ocean stretching far as eye can gaze,— Newer heavens and newer waters, solitary and profound, Rise before us, while behind us Day arises crimson-crown'd! Turning we behold the shadows of the straits through which we sped, Then again our eyes look forward where the windless waters spread; Overhead the sun rolls golden, moving westward through the blue, Reddens down the far-off heavens, beckons bright, and we pursue. On that vast and tranquil Ocean, folding wings the strong winds dwell, Sleeping softly or just stirring to the water's tranquil swell, Peaceful as the fields of heaven where the stars like bright flocks feed,— So that many dream they wander thro' the azure Heaven indeed! Then Magellan, from its scabbard drawing forth his shining sword, Grasps the blade, and downward bending dips the bright hilt overboard— ‘By the holy Cross's likeness, mirror'd in this hilt!’ cries he, ‘Be this Ocean called Pacific, since it sleeps eternallie!’ Pastured with a calm eternal, drawing down the clouds in dew, Sighing low with soft pulsations, darkly, mystically blue, Lies that long untrodden Ocean, while for months we sail it o'er; Ever dawns the sun behind us, ever swiftly sets before. But like devils out of Tophet, as we sail with God for Guide, Rise the Spectres, Thirst and Hunger, hollow-cheek'd and cruel-eyed; Fierce and famish'd creep the seamen, while the tongues between their teeth Loll like tongues of hounds for water, dry as dust and black with death. Many fall and die blaspheming, ‘Give us food!’ the living call— Pallid as a man of marble stands the Master gaunt and tall, Hunger fierce within him also, and his parch'd lips prest in pain, But a mightier thirst and hunger burning in his heart and brain! Black decks blistering in the sunlight, sails and cordage dry as clay, Crawl the ships on those still waters night by night and day by day; Then the rain comes, and we lap it as upon the decks it flows— ‘Spread a sail!’ calls out the Master, and we catch it ere it goes. Now and then a lonely sea-bird hovers far away, and we Crouch with hungry eyes and watch it fluttering closer o'er the sea, Curse it if it flies beyond us, shoot it if it cometh nigh, Share the flesh and blood among us, underneath the Captain's eye. Sometimes famish'd unto madness, fierce as wolves that shriek in strife, One man springs upon another, stabs him with the murderous knife; Then the Master, stalking forward where the murderer shrinks in dread, Bids him kneel, and as he kneeleth cleaves him down, and leaves him dead. O Magellan! mighty Eagle, circling sunward lost in light, Wafting wings of power and striking meaner things that cross thy flight, God to such as thee gives never lambkin's love or dove's desire— Nay, but eyes that scatter terror from a ruthless heart of fire! Give me wine. My pulses falter. . . So! . . . Confusion to the cowls! They who hooted at my Eagle, eyes of bats and heads of owls! Throw the casement open wider! There is something yet to tell— How we came at last to waters where the naked islesmen dwell. Isles of wonder, fringed with coral, ring'd with shallows turquoise-blue, Where bright fish and crimson monsters flash'd their jewel'd lights and flew, Steeps of palm that rose to heaven out of purple depths of sea, While upon their sunlit summits stirr'd the tufted cocoa-tree— Isles of cinnabar and spices, where soft airs for ever creep, Scenting Ocean all around them with strange odours soft as sleep— Isles about whose promontories danced the black man's light canoe, Isles where dark-eyed women beckon'd, perfumed like the breath they drew. Drunken with the sight we landed, rush'd into the scented glades, Treading down the scented branches, seized the struggling savage maids. Ah, the orgy! Still it sickens!—blood of men bestrewed our path, Till the islesmen rose against us, thick as vultures shrieking wrath. Then, the sequel! Nay, I know not how the damnëd deed could be— By some islesman's poisoned arrow or some Spaniard's treacherie; But one evening, as we struggled fighting to our boats on shore, In the shallows fell the Captain, foully slain, and rose no more! O Magellan! O my Master! O my Captain, King of men! Was it fit thou so shouldst perish, though thy work was over then, Foully slain by foe or comrade, butcher'd like a common thing, Thou whose eagle flight had circled Earth upon undaunted wing! Nay, but then my King had conquered! Earth and Ocean to his sight Open'd had their wondrous visions, shaming centuries of night; Nay, but even the shining Heavens kept the record of his fame— Earth was round, and high above it shone Magellan's starry name. How our wondrous voyage ended? Nay, I know not,—all was done; Lying in my ship I sickened, moaning, hidden from the sun. Yea! the vessels drifted onward till hey came to isles of calm, Where some savage monarch hail'd them, standing underneath a palm. How the wanderers took these islands tributary to our King, Show'd the Cross, baptized the monarch, homeward crept on weary wing? Pshaw, 'tis nothing! All was over! He had staked his soul and gained, They but reaped the Master's sowing, they but crawl'd where he had reigned! Hark! what sound is that? The chiming of the dreary vesper bell? Nay, I hear but Ocean sighing, feel the waters heave and swell. Earth is round, but sailing sunward with my Master still I fare— Other Heavens his ship is searching,—and I go to seek him there! The wall of darkness round the rainy house Broke as I ended, and a watery beam Of sunshine struck the pane, and lingering on it, Became prismatic. Then with quiet smile Professor Mors, the truculent Irishman, Whose treatise on the origin of worlds Fluttered the Churches for a season, said: ‘Man conquers earth, and climbing yonder Heaven Pursues the baleful gods from throne to throne! Ah, but the strife was long, and even here It hath not ended yet. Each Phantom laid, Another rises, though on fearless wing We creep from world to world. Evil abides, And with her hideous mother, Ignorance, Scatters pollution!’ Calmly answered him Dan Paumanok, the Yankee pantheist: ‘Friend, I have dwelt on earth as long as you, And found all evil here but forms of good!’ Whereat some laughed, and cried, ‘A paradox!’ But, gravely leaning back in his arm-chair, The greybeard cried, ‘Knowledge and Ignorance, I calculate, are sisters—otherwise Named Good and Evil. Hand in hand they walk, So like, that even those who know them best Scarcely distinguish their identities! Thro' the dark places of the troubled earth The first walks radiant and the last gropes blind; But when they come upon the mountaintops, In the night's stillness, underneath the stars, The last it is that ofttimes leads the first And points her upward to the heavenly way!’ ‘If this be so,’ the grim Professor cried, Shrugging his shoulders with impatient sneer, ‘Then wrong is every whit as good as right, The Darkness is no better than the Light It comprehends not!’ ‘Certainly,’ exclaimed The melancholy transcendentalist; ‘One is the tally of the other, friend; Nay more, they intermingle, and are one! The morning dew, that scarcely bends the flowers, Exhaled to heaven becomes the thunderbolt That strikes and slays at noon.’ But Mors replied With cold superior smile: ‘A cheerful creed! And comfortable,—since, whate'er befalls, No matter if the foemen sack the city, No matter if the plague-cart comes and goes, No matter if the starving cry for bread, The sleepy watchman calmly cries “All's well!” For my poor part, as one whose youth was spent, Not in pursuit of vain delusive dreams, But in the halls of Science, whom I serve, I fail to find in Evil any form My mistress would be brought to christen good; Nay, on my life,’ he added, gathering zeal, ‘Than such a pantheistic lotus-flower I'd rather choose those husks and shells of grace John Calvin found when, prone on hands and knees, He searched the garbage of Original Sin! And rather than believe that Hell was Heaven, People my Hell once more with soot-black fiends! For Fever, Pestilence, and Ignorance No angels are, fall'n from some high estate, But devilish shapes indeed, beneath the heel Of Hermes, god of healing and of light, Soon to be trampled down and vanquishëd. And other hideous things that waste the world, War, Superstition, Anarchy, Disease, Monsters that Man has fashion'd, like to that Framed in the poet's tale by Frankenstein— These shall be slain by their creator's hand, Their Master's, even Man's. Survey the earth; And see the sunrise of our saner creed Scattering the darkness and the poisonous fumes Which eighteen hundred weary years ago Came from the sunless sepulchre of Christ. Where Fever poisoned the pellucid wel The drinking-fountain clear as crystal flows; Where the marsh thicken'd and miasma spread, Cities arise, with clean and shining streets And sewers transmuting garbage into gold; Where the foul blood-stained Altar once was set, Stand the Museum and Laboratory; The Library, the Gymnasium, and the Bath Replace the palace; Manufactories, Gathering together precious gifts for man, Supplant the Monolith and Pyramid. Thus everywhere the light of human love Brightens a wondering convalescent world Just rising from the spectre-haunted bed Whereon it sickened of a long disease, Attended by the false physician, Christ.’ He paused; the fever of his eager words Flash'd on from face to face until it reached The face of Verity, the priest of Art; But there it faded, for with pallid frown And lifted hands, the gentle prophet cried: ‘Light? Sunrise? Sunlight? I who speak have eyes, And yet I see but darkness visible! Lost is the azure in whose virgin depths The filmy cirrus turn'd to Shapes divine, Goddess and god, soft-vestured, white as wool! Faded the sun, which, striking things of stone, Turn'd them to statues which like Memnon's sang, And palpitating over domes and walls, Cover'd them o'er with forms miraculous, Prismatic, which the hand of genius touch'd And fixed in colour ere the forms could fade! The world, you say, is heal'd; to me, it seems Just smitten with the plague, and everywhere The foul cloud gathers, shutting out the sun. And that faint sound we deem the sweet church chimes, Is but the death-bell tinkling, while the cart Comes for its load of dark disfigured dead. Meantime, within the foul dissecting-room The form of Man, which, ere our plague-time came, Was reverenced in shapes of loveliness, Rosy in flesh, or snowy white in stone, Lies desecrated, hideous, horrible, Pois'ning the air and sickening the soul! And on the slab, beneath the torturer's knife, Man's gentle friend, the hound, shrieks piteously, Answer'd by all the bleeding flocks of Pan! And everywhere the fume of Anarchy, And hideous monsters of machinery Toiling for ever in their own thick breath, Blends with the plague-smoke, blotting out the sun, Whereby alone all shapes of beauty live!’ ‘Nay, nay,’ cried Barbara, ‘though it rains to-day The lift will clear to-morrow. I believe You all are partly right and partly wrong, For surely many things in life that seem Most evil are but blessings in disguise? And difficult 'tis, maybe, to discern Where Knowledge ends and Ignorance begins. But then, again, what soul rejoices not To see yon mailéd Perseus, Science, stand Bruising the loathsome hydra of Disease, Ay, often slaying Sin and conquering Death? And yet, again, the counter-plea is true, That Science, though she heals the wounds of life, Whiles heals them cruelly and uncannily,— Just shuts the sufferer in a sunless room, And changes the old merry tunes of time To daft mechanic discord, such as that Which issues from the throats of mine and mill, With sough of poisonous reek and flames more sad Than ever came from Tophet!’ As she ceased, Professor Mors, the pallid pessimist, Outstretched his lean and skeletonian hand, Pointing out sunward:—‘See!’ he cried, ‘the God, Last-born and first-born, Nature's microcosm, Who, sitting on his mighty throne of graves, Murmurs the death-dirge of Humanity! Had ye but ears, methinks that you might catch The burthen of his melancholy song, As I myself have heard it oftentimes When wandering weary underneath the stars. 'Twas thus, methinks, it ran, or something thus, Full of a burthen strange and sad as ever Was heard beside the wave-wash'd shores of Time.’ SOLILOQUY OF THE GRAND ÊTRE. I am God, who was Man. Lord of earth, sea, and sky, I endure while men die; The River of Life laps my feet, flowing by. Out of darkness it came, into darkness it goes, From repose to repose, And mirrors my face in its flood as it flows. I am Man, who was men. I am flesh, sense, and soul, I was part who am Whole, I am God, being Man, whom no god may control. Now, sitting alone on my throne, I survey The dim Past far away, Whence I came, on the borders of infinite day. All things and all forces combining have brought Me, their God, out of nought, Through the night-time of sense to the morning of thought. I think and I am. I look round me, and lo! I remember and know Both whence I have issued and whither I go. I stand on the heights of the earth, and descry, From sky on to sky, The path through the ages that led me so high. From the deserts of space where my firewebs were spun, Spreading thence one by one Till they flash'd into flame and cohered to a sun; From the great whirling sun whence, with no eye to mark, I shot like a spark, Then spun fiery-wing'd, round and round, through the dark. There slowly, alone in the silence of space, I moved in my place, With the night at my back and the light on my face. First shapeless and formless, then spheric and fair, With no sense, with no care, I cool'd my hot breast in dark fountains of air. And the mist of my breathing enwrapt me, and grew Like a cloud in the blue— Then flooded my frame with warm oceans of dew. In the waters I swam, while the sun, red as blood, Of the waves of that flood Wove a green grassy sheen, for my raiment and food. At last, one bright morn, with no sense, with no sight, After æons of night, I lay like a bride new apparell'd and bright. And embracing my Bridegroom, who bent from the skies With bright beautiful eyes, Felt something within me grow quick, and arise. And straightway I too was the seed, and behold! Small and lustrous and cold, I moved in the slime, taking shapes manifold. I was quick who was clay. I was living and drew Breath of darkness and dew; From form on to form groping blindly, I grew. Then form'd like a Monster with wings, I upleapt From the waters and swept Through the mirk of their breath; or lay snakewise, and crept. Change on change, till I wander'd on hands and on feet Where the cloud-waves retreat; And ever each age I grew fair and more fleet. The world that was I brighten'd round me, and still, Some strange task to fulfil, I changed and I changed, with no wish, with no will. At last, after æons of death and decay, At the gateways of Day I stood, looking up at the heavens far away! The sea at my feet, and the stars o'er my head, Naked, dark, with proud tread I walked on the heights, being quick, who was dead. I was Man, who was monster. I lived, and I drew Gentle breath from the blue, Looked backward and forward, moved blindly, but knew. And I heark'd to the sounds of the earth, to the herds Of the beasts and the birds, And I broke to wild babble of mystical words. I could speak, who was dumb; I could smile, who was stone; Of those others not one Could speak or could smile. I was kinglike and lone. I reign'd o'er the earth, and I slew for a feast Both the bird and the beast; My seed, scatter'd eastward and westward, increased. But I feared what the bird and the beast did not fear: Shapes of dread creeping near In the night-time, strange voices that cried in mine ear. And I saw what the bird and the beast could not see— Shapes that thunder'd at me From the clouds overhead, till I prayed on my knee. And I named the dark gods that the beasts could not name— And I crouch'd, fearing blame At the voice of the waters, the thunder's acclaim. One god seemed the strangest and saddest of all, Who with silent footfall Slew my seed in the night, smote the great and the small. Men were scattered like leaves—I remained being Man; 'Neath the blight and the ban, Like a hound on the grave of its master I ran On the tombs of my race, crying loud in despair To the gods of the air, Who changed as the clouds and were deaf to my prayer. Then I learned the one Name that the gods overhead Ever whisper'd in dread, And methought He was Lord of the quick and the dead. For I looked on the Book of the stars, and could frame The strange signs of the Name, And yet when I called Him He heard not, nor came. And as wave follows wave, or as cloud follows cloud, Flash'd my kind in their crowd, Then slept in their season, each man in his shroud. Men died, but I died not; I lived and discerned, With my face ever turned To the skies, where the lights of my universe burned. Then I groped on the earth, and I searched sea and land For the signs of the Hand Which shaped the cloud-limits, the stars, and the sand. And all that I found was the footprints of clay I had left on my way From the darkness of night to the borders of day. Then I search'd the great voids of the heaven for a trace Of a Form or a Face; I questioned the stars—each was dumb in its place. So I cried ‘Wheresoever I gaze, I descry, On the earth, in the sky, One thing that is deathless, the Life that is I!’ And I cried, as I looked on the image I cast On the limitless Vast, ‘I was from the first, and I am till the last!’ I am Lord of the world. I am God, being Man. In the night I began, Then grew from a cell to a soul, without plan. As far as the limits of Time and of Space I my footprints can trace Wending onward and upward, from race back to race. I behold, who was blind. I was part, who am Whole. As the waters that roll Are my seed who forsake and upbuild me, their Soul. Do they weep? I am calm. Do they doubt? I am sure. Though they die, I endure, As a fire that ascending grows stainless and pure. I discern all the Past, waves on waves that have fled, While I press with slow tread To a goal I discern not, o'er snowdrifts of dead. I am Thought in the flesh, who was Sense in the seed. Silent, sanctified, freed, I emerge, the full sign of the Dream and the Deed. I am God, being Man. In my glory I blend Life and death without end. If the Void hold my peer, let Him speak. I attend. ‘So speaks the last and mightiest of the gods, Our Master, Man immortal!’ Sparkle cried; ‘His shadow fills the universe as far As His own thought can wing; His bright eyes face The sunlight with a blaze it cannot blind; And in the hollow of His hand He weighs The stars that are His playthings. He has slain All other gods, the greatest and the least, And now within the inmost heart of earth He builds a Temple more miraculous Than any little temple wrought in stone!’ ‘Say rather,’ answered Bishop Eglantine, ‘He wearily prepares the funeral pyre Whereon Himself, in the dim coming years, Shall mount and royally burn, or (failing fire) Whereon outstretch'd He shall await the end, While quietly the skeleton hands of Frost Weave Him a shroud, and Time doth snow upon Him Out of the heavens of eternal cold! For is not one thing sure, that this round world Must perish in its season, or become A habitation where no breathing thing Can longer creep or crawl? Alas for Him, Your poor Grand Être, enrooted like a tree In the still changing soil of human life, When human life itself shall pass away As breath upon a mirror, and Night resume Her empire on the rayless universe. Wiser, methinks, than your pale seer of France, Who fashion'd this same shadow of a god, Is he who prophesies in soul's despair The sure extinction of the conscious types. Place for the pessimist!—in Hartmann comes A later Buddha, and a balefuller. “Ere yet Man's Soul,” he crieth, “merges back Into the nothingness from which it rose, Three stages of illusion must be past: The stage of a belief in happiness In this hard world; the stage of a belief In happiness in any world to come; And last, the stage of yet more foolish faith In any happiness the race can gain Beyond the life of individual man. Your god, then, is foredoom'd to nothingness, Surely as Zeus or any of the slain Already peopling chaos!”’ ‘Yet—he reigns!’ Cried Sparkle, ‘and we do him reverence! Fairer than Balder, tenderer than Christ, His brethren, mightier than Jove or Brahm, He adumbrates the wisdom and the joy Of Nature, and his large beneficence Extends sweet aid to all created things. All that he prophesies and promises He realises and fulfils, unlike The thunderer on Sinai, or the God Who wore the crown of thorns!’ ‘Alas, poor God!’ Murmur'd that other. ‘Fashion'd out of pain, Shapen in doubt, and clothen with despair, How shall He, having re-created Earth And brought the fabled Eden back again, Shut out the memory of His own sad dead? For looking backward, He beholds the world Strewn with the graves of those who have lived and loved, And suffered, to complete His deity; And looking sadly round Him, He beholds Millions in act to suffer, hears the wail That shall not cease for many an age to come; And looking forward, He sees the cataclysm Of Nature, and his own completed work Abolish'd in the twinkling of a star! O pale phantasmic mockery of a god! O shadow fainter than all shadows cast Since first the wild man fear'd the darkness, shrieked At his own shape projected on the cloud— A spectre of the Brocken, a forlorn Image of primal ignorance and fear! Shall we resign for such a dream as this Our human birthright and our heavenly hope?’ ‘Nay,’ interposed another—Edward Clay, Pupil of Verity and Ercildoune, ‘The exodus from Paris following The exodus from Houndsditch, what remain But human types of godhead, fit at least For temporary worship? I will travel As far as Mecca on my hands and knees To see a godlike man,—in whom alone We find the apex and the crown of things, The vindication of Humanity. The individual gives the type divine, The rest, the race, is nothing!’ Thereupon Outspoke Dan Paumanok, the pantheist: ‘Friend, I have often known your godlike men, And loved them, not for that wherein they missed, But that wherein they shared, the common strength And weakness of the race. I love to look On Goethe's feet of clay, to touch the dross Mixed with the golden heart of Washington, To think that Socrates, who braved the gods And drank his hemlock cup so cheerfully, Shrank from the chiding of a shrew at home. Gods? Godlike men? I guess all men possess, By right of manhood, godlike qualities; But high as ever human type has reached, The wave of masterful Humanity Sweeps higher, striking yonder shore of stars! Worship no man at all, but every man, Man typical, Man cosmic, multiform, The flower and fruit of Being; seize the Thought Effused from human forms as light is shed Out of the motion of a living thing; Follow the sunward flight of our fair race, Which breathes and suffers, multiplies and dies, And in a million forms of sense and soul Sweeps into action and is justified! The blacksmith at his anvil, the glad child Gathering shells upon the ocean shore, The scientist in his laboratory, The prostitute that walks the moonlit streets, The sailor at the masthead, or the poet Lying and dreaming in the summer wood— All these, and countless other forms divine, Are evermore divine enough for me. Fast through them flows the strange and mystic Thought We comprehend not being things that die, But which, if we but knew, is Life itself— Large Life and ample godhead. We are forms The god-force fashions, as it fashions suns And clouds and waves and patient animals, Dead things and living, quickening through the stars As through the kindling ovum in the womb,— And every form of life, howe'er so faint, Is corporate godhead!’ ‘Ho! a heretic!’ Cried Douglas, laughing; ‘come, my myrmidons, Make ready there the faggots and the stake: By Cock and by St. Peter, Dan must burn. For less than this Giordano Bruno wore The martyr's shirt of fire, for less than this John Calvin tuck'd the bed of flaming coals Around Servetus, chuckling to himself “He called me names, improbus et blasphemus, And routing me in argument, affirm'd Stone bench and table, things inanimate, To be celestial Substance, very God: Wherefore I hand him to be burned alive By such celestial Substance—wood, coals, fire— And to this God I leave him cheerfully!” For John had humour, mark you, grim as death And blue as brimstone; for the rest, he knew The God of Judah kept His ancient tastes And dearly loved a human sacrifice!’ ‘Those days are done for ever,’ Primrose said, ‘And he who slew Servetus in his wrath Slew also priestcraft and the crimson Beast, So that the lamb of gentleness might reign.’ ‘Indeed!’ cried Sparkle with a smile and sneer. ‘One comfort is, grim John invented Hell, Fit home for such a ravening wolf as he! Why, yes, we grant you Hell, if you admit Your Calvin's place there! But I doubt indeed If you have yet abolished martyrdom. I know full many Christians, worthy souls, Who swear by book and preach to simple men, Who, did our gentler human laws permit, Would strip our Cuthberts naked to the skin And give them fire for raiment willingly! Ay, and they do it, freely dealing out Moral damnation and keen social flame, So that no man alive, if he would keep His worldly goods and social privileges, Dare speak the thing he thinks, or openly Affirm the heavens are empty, God dethroned. The thinker is an outcast as of old, And scarcely dares to phrase his thought aloud Even on the pillow where he rests his head, Lest his goodwife should hear the heresy, And call the curate or the parish priest To compass his conversion, or at least Rescue the little ones from blight and bane.’ ‘Why not?’ most sadly answer'd Eglantine; ‘Blame not the shepherd if he seeks to save His lambkins from the touch of Antichrist. Our gentle Inquisition, though it works In cruelty no more, but all in love, Is slack, too slack. The age is godless, sir. Affrighted by the spectres all around, Our priests lack zeal! Meantime how busily The self-approven priests of Science toil— The Devil still is busier gathering tares Than angels who upbind the golden grain.’ Another voice broke in, a woman's voice, Clear-toned and gentle—round Miss Hazlemere's, The grey-hair'd lassie with a matron's form And mother's yearning in her virgin eyes: Half doubter, half believer, she asserts The privilege of woman's sex to solve Problems to which the arid minds of men Are too untender and rectangular, Rebukes the Churches, rates the scientists, And lights a lonely spiritual lamp By stormy waters, on the rocks of Doubt. ‘The truth's with Father Eglantine,’ she said; ‘A priestcraft is a priestcraft, though it speaks The first word of Religion or the last Of Science. I would trust Geneva John No more than Torquemada, and no less Than Cuthbert or than Mors, if e'er the law Arm'd them with amplitude of priestly power. Think you there is no Inquisition now? Alas! I too know scores of simple souls Who, having kept their foolish faith in God, Anthropomorphic, ancient, infantine, Are, brought before the judges of the time, Condemn'd as mad or hypocritical! The old belief is so unfashionable Among the very wise and over-wise, That he who dares affirm it openly Is deem'd unfit to govern his own wife Or be the lord of his own nursery. And presently, be sure, if this thing grows, 'Twill be as perilous to believe in God As 'twas in darker ages to discuss God's Substance, or attempt to separate The Tria Juncta of the Trinity. No priestcraft and no priest at all, say I, But freedom and free thought, free scope, free choice To fashion any fetish that I please!’ So speaking, she was conscious of two eyes, Youthful and eloquent, regarding her: Mr. Marsh Mallow, bright and bold, but growing Like his own namesake in a watery place, Caught up the ball she smiling threw his way, And cried: ‘Truth still remains with Eglantine! The Church which builds itself on Peter's Rock, And still doth keep the keys of Heaven and Hell, Lacks zeal to face those Spectres of the mind Which it might lay to sleep for evermore With just one wave of the enchanter's wand. Meantime they rush abroad like ravening wolves, Appalling Reason, making Love afraid, Rending in twain the beauteous heaven-eyed Lamb Which men have christen'd Faith. But patience yet; The priestcraft and the priest shall conquer yet, And men grow holy in their own despite!’ Flush'd to the temples, Stephen Harkaway, The dandy of revolt, a positivist, And positive to the very finger-tips, Made answer: ‘Yet again the solemn truth Remains with Eglantine! The priest shall reign, And on the sands of time another Pope Upbuild another and a fairer Rome. There the apostles of the fair new creed, Having abolished Christ and all the gods, Destroyed the current poison of belief In individual immortality, Shall to the only god, Humanity, Sing their hosannah! Ay, and they shall raise Their Inquisition on the heart of man, And unto Vice and Ignorance and Disease, All things that mar their god's divinity, Deal the peine forte et dure! Prison and fire Shall fright the fortune-telling charlatans Who creep with old wives' tales from house to house! Since Man without a creed is stark and starved, And only feeble souls desiderate A creed without a priestcraft, ours shall be Tyrannical, I trust, and, furthermore, Kind to the very verge of cruelty! No fetish, Madam, will be tolerated, Nor any juggler's tricks to cheat the soul.’ ‘I thank you, sir,’ Miss Hazlemere replied, ‘For throwing off the mask that we may see The features of your God. I ever thought Your Comte a Jesuit in disguise! But come, Our Queen looks sadly on this war of words, And longs to hush its Babel. Who will touch The midriff of the mystery with a song? For Music, of all angels walking earth, Is fittest far to phrase the Thought divine Which dies away in utterance on the lips That only speak poor human nature's prose. Sweet Music gropes her way and walketh blind Because she saw the Vision long ago And closed her eyes in joy unutterable, The light of which lies ever upon her face Although she cannot see!’ Then at a sign From Lady Barbara, I, her poet, rose And touch'd the instrument, with eager hand Sounded a prelude of precipitous notes, Then broke to measured song; and thus I sang:— O MARINERS. O Mariners, out of the sunlight, and on through the infinite Main, We have sailed, departing at morning;—and now it is morning again. Dimly, darkly, and blindly, our life and our journey begun, Blind and deaf was our sense with the fiery sands of the sun. Then slowly, grown stronger and stronger, feeling from zone on to zone, We passed the islands of darkness, and reached the sad Ocean, alone. But now we pause for a moment, searching the east and the west, Above and beneath us the waters that mirror our eyes in their breast! Behind, the dawn and the darkness,—new dawn around and before,— Ah me, we are weary, and hunger to rest, and to wonder no more. Yet never, O Mariners, never were we so stately and fair— The forms of the flood obey us, we are lords of the birds of the air. And yet as we sail we are weeping, and crying, ‘Although we have ranged So far over infinite waters, transformed out of darkness and changed, We know that the Deep beneath us must drink us and wash us away’— Nay, courage—sail on for a season—on, on to the gateways of Day. Our voyage is only beginning—its dreariest dangers are done, We now have a compass to guide us, the Soul, and it points to the Sun! The stars in their places obey us, the winds are as slaves to our sail— Be sure that we never had journey'd so far but to perish and fail! Out of the wonderful sunlight, and on through the infinite Main, We have sail'd, departing at morning—and now it is morning again! INTERLUDE. To H?. Dearest, thou whose lightest breath Sweetens Life and conquers Death, Fair as pure, and purer far Than the dreams of poets are, Unto thee, and only thee, I upon my bended knee Give my birthright—Poesy! Ishmael of the singing race, Born where sky and mountain meet, Standing in a lonely place With the world below my feet, Wrapt about with mist and cloud, Songs of joy I sang aloud! Then the Muses of the North, Like Valkyries heavenly-eyed, From the storm-cloud trooping forth, Found me on the mountain-side, Buckled on my mail of steel, Arm'd me nobly head to heel, Placed a sword within my hand, Made me warrior of the Right, Crying, ‘Go and take thy stand In the vanward of the fight! Hasten forth, made strong and free, Through thy birthright—Poesy!’ Then I gazed, and far below Saw the fires of battle glow, Saw the banners of the world Kindle, to the winds unfurl'd,— Saw the pomp of priests and kings Girt about by underlings, Hunting down with sword and spear Liberty, the fleet red-deer,— Saw the Cities vast and loud, Foul as Sodom and as proud, Each a Monster in its mire Crouching low with eyes of fire; Heard the cruel trumpet's blare, Mix'd with plagal-hymns of prayer, Saw the world from sea to sea Blind to Death and Deity! Singing loud with savage joy Down the glens I sprang, a boy— Downward as the torrent swept, On from rock to rock I leapt, Reach'd the valleys where the fight Flash'd in flame from morn to night, Plunged into the thickest strife, Scarcely knowing friend from foe, Knew the bloody stress of life, Till a sword-thrust laid me low. Slowly on the moonlit plain, Where the dead lay dark and dumb, I, unclosing mine eyes again, Saw my fair Valkyries come. Bending over me they crooned Loving runes and heal'd my wound,— Then they cried, ‘Uprise once more, Seek the City's inmost core, Find the wretched and opprest, Sing them mountain-songs of cheer; Help the basest, brand the best, We shall watch and hover near— Face the King upon his throne, Face the Priest within the shrine, Fear no voice save God's alone (Thou hast heard it oft intone Through the cloud-wrapt woods of pine)— Take thy place, but close to thee Clasp thy birthright—Poesy!’ Through the City's gates I crept Silent, while the watchmen slept— Pass'd from shade to shade wherein Crowded monstrous shapes of sin, Peer'd against the panes to see Lamplit rooms of revelry, Where the warrior's head did rest On the harlot's wine-stain'd breast; Linger'd on the bridges great, Melancholy, desolate; Watch'd the river roll beneath, Shimmering in the moonbeam's breath; Met the fluttering forms that pass Painted underneath the gas, Mark'd the murderer's fearful face Looming in a lonely place, Knew the things that wake, and those Lost in rapture of repose; Saw the gradual Dawn flash red On the housetops overhead, Till the morning glory broke, And the sleeping Monster woke! Singing loud in savage joy, In the streets I stood, a boy! Round me flocked the citizens, Thronging from their homes and dens, While I spake of signs and dreams Learn'd among the hills and streams, Of the God with veilèd head Passing by with thunder-tread On the mountains red with morn In whose bosom I was born. In a tongue uncouth I sang, While the air with laughter rang, Loudest, merriest, when I told Of strange visions in the night— God and angels manifold Shining on the mountain-height; Then a voice cried, ‘Come away, He is mad, this mountaineer!’— Lonely in the morning gray Soon I sang, with none to hear, Save a few sad outcast men, And a weeping Magdalen. Then with loud prophetic song To the public marts I came, Strode amidst the busy throng, Curst the avarice and the shame, Call'd the wrath of God upon Cæsar sitting on his throne, By the lights of Heaven and Hell Shamed the tinsel'd priests of Bel. Then around me ere I knew Clamour of the factions grew, Thronging, shrieking, multiplying, Came the legions of the lying, Cast me down and stript me bare; Yet I struggled in despair, Till a poison'd dagger's thrust Laid me dying in the dust. Then the night came, and the skies With innumerable eyes Saw me lying there alone, Bleeding on the streets of stone; While my voice before I died On my wild Valkyries cried. Closing eyelids with a sigh, Into night I seem'd to pass, Seem'd to fade away and fly As the breath upon a glass. Presently I woke again, Thinking ‘All is o'er and done, This is chilly Death's domain, Far away from moon and sun!’ Even then methought I heard Something moving, breathing near; Struggling with the sense I stirred, Open'd eyes in fluttering fear, And before my dazzled sight Shone a Vision heavenly bright! Ah, the Vision! ah, the blest Rapture, smiling manifest! O'er me bending stood and smiled Love in likeness of a Child,— Holding in her gentle hand Lilies of the Heavenly Land! Azure eyes and golden hair, Gazing on me unafraid, Sweetly, marvellously fair, Stood the little Angel-Maid! Shall I tell how that same hour Little hands my wound did dress, How I woke to life and power Through that Maiden's tenderness? Shall I tell (ah, wherefore tell Unto her who knows so well?) Of the strength that came to me, Not from my Valkyries wild, Who in need abandon'd me, But from that celestial Child? Though my sword was broken, though Helm and mail were lying low, Though my savage strength was shed, I was quick who late was dead, All my mountain blood again Rush'd electric to my brain, All grew fair where'er I trod With that messenger of God. Need I tell (ah, wherefore tell Unto her who wrought the spell?) How I seem'd from that strange hour Arm'd in nakedness of power?— Yet the dagger's thrust again, Poison'd, treacherous, as before, Sought me out and would have slain, While we passed from door to door, Curst, rejected, and denied, Ishmael, I, and thou, my Guide! Child of Light, thy loving look Brighten'd at each step we took, Kindled into love more strong At each cruel slight and wrong, While thy presence heavenly bright Grew from child's to woman's height, And within thy pensive eyes Rose the lore that makes us wise,— Woman's love, without whose gleam Life is like a drunkard's dream! Need I tell (ah, wherefore tell, When thy soul remembers well?) How smooth Jacob and his race, Hounding me from place to place, Hating truth and cursing me, Stole my birthright—Poesy? How the sources of my song, Darken'd o'er and frozen numb, Cold and silent lay for long Like a fountain seal'd and dumb, Till thy finger touch'd at last Springs the world deem'd frozen fast? High in sunlight, sparkling o er, Leaps my fount of song once more, While thy blessing back to me Brings my birthright—Poesy! Child of Light, whose softest breath Sweetens Life and conquers Death, Fair as pure, and purer far Than the dreams of poets are, Never tongue of man can tell All thy gifts to Ishmaèl!— Side by side and hand in hand,— Facing yonder mountain-land Whence I came and whereupon God the Lord has set His throne,— Through the shadowy vales below Climbing sunward, let us go. If I sing, I sing through thee! Wherefore, Sweet, still share with me What I bring on bended knee— This my birthright,—Poesy!— New York: Yuletide, 1884. The City of Dream. (1888.) ARGUMENT. One Ishmael, born in an earthly City beside the sea, having heard strange tidings of a Heavenly City, sets forth to seek the same; and as he fares forth he is blindfolded by Evangelist, and given a Holy Book; reading which Book, he wanders on terrified and blindfold, until, coming by chance to the house of one Iconoclast, he is relieved of the bandage covering his eyes, and led to an eminence, whence he beholds all the Pilgrims of the World. Quitting Evangelist, he encounters Pitiful, and is directed towards the City of Christopolis, but in the crowded highway leading thitherward he meets Eglantine, who warns him that Christopolis is not the City of his quest. Yet nevertheless he proceeds thither in his new friend's company. He wanders through Christopolis and sees strange sights therein; but being denounced for unbelief and heresy, he takes refuge beyond a great Gate dividing the City into two parts. Wise men accost him and warn him that peace and assurance are to be found only in the Book given him by Evangelist; but this in his perversity he denies, and casting away the Book is again denounced as unbelieving, and driven out of the City into the areary region beyond it. His talk with one Merciful, who beseeches him in vain to pause and pray. Flying on he knows not whither, he encounters rain and tempest, and takes shelter in a woeful Wayside Inn, where he meets the outcasts of all the creeds. His journey thence through the night, and his meeting with the wild horseman Esau, who carries him to the Groves of Faun, watched over by the shepherd Thyrsis and his child, a maid of surpassing beauty. Led by Thyrsis, he sees the Vales of Vain Delight, and after drinking of the Waters of Oblivion, beholds the living apparition of the Greek god Eros. He sails with Eros over strange waters, and comes betimes to an Amphitheatre among mountains, where he witnesses the sacrificial tragedy of Cheiron, and the transubstantiation of Eros. He passes through the Valley of Dead Gods, and finds there his townsman Faith lying dead and cold. Yet he dies not, but finds himself on a wan wayside, close to a rain-worn Cross, and holds speech with Sylvan, leaving whom he climbs again upward among mountains and shelters with the Hermit of the Mere. Thereon one Nightshade leads him up the highest peaks and shows him the Spectre of the Inconceivable; after which sight of wonder he finds himself worn and old, but emerges presently in full daylight on the Open Way, whence, after parleying with Lateral and with Microcos, he is guided by a gentle stranger to the gates of the City builded without God. His weary wanderings and experiences in that same City, latest and fairest of any built by Man, till the hour when, sickened and afraid, he forsakes it and flies on into the region of Monsters and strange births of Time. At last, in the winter of his pilgrimage, he beholds the old man Masterful, who becomes his guide to the brink of the Celestial Ocean; and now, standing on those mysterious shores, the highest peak of earth, he sees a Ship of Souls; but as it vanishes in the cœrulean haze, he awakens, and knows that all he hath seen—yea, all his spirit's life-long quest— hath been only a Dream within a Dream. DEDICATION: TO THE SAINTED SPIRIT OF JOHN BUNYAN. O Teller of the Fairy Tale Divine, How bright a dream was thine,— Wherein God's City shining as a star Gleam'd silently from far O'er haunted wastes, where Pilgrims pale as death Toil'd slow, with bated breath! Like children at thy knees we gather'd all, Man, maiden, great and small; Tho' death was nigh and snow was on our hair, Yet still we gather'd there, Feeling upon our cheeks blow sweet and bland A breath from Fairyland! The sunless Book, held ever on thy knee, Grew magical thro' thee; Touch'd by thy wand the fountain of our fear Sprang bright and crystal clear; Thy right hand held a lily flower most fair, And holly deck'd thy hair. Of Giants and of Monsters thou didst tell, Fiends, and the Pit of Hell; Of Angels that like swallows manifold Fly round God's eaves of gold; Of God Himself, the Spirit those adore, Throned in the City's core! O fairy Tale Divine! O gentle quest Of Christian and the rest! What wonder if we love it to the last, Tho' childish faith be past, What marvel if it changes not, but seems The pleasantest of dreams? Far other paths we follow—colder creeds Answer our spirits' needs— The gentle dream is done;—'neath life's sad shades, The fabled City fades:— The God within it, shooting from his throne, Falls, like a meteor stone! So much is lost, yet still we mortals sad Despair not or grow mad, But still search on, in hope to find full blest The City of our quest;— New guides to lead; below, new lights of love, And grander Gods, above. And while of this strange latter quest I sing, First to thy skirts I cling Like to a child, and in thy face I look As in a gentle book, And all thy happy lore and fancies wise I gather from thine eyes. Tho' that first faith in Fairyland hath fled, Its glory is not dead; And tho' the lesser truth exists no more, Yet in thy sweet Tale's core The higher truth of poesy divine For evermore shall shine. There dwells within all creeds of mortal birth, That die and fall to earth, A higher element, a spark most bright Of primal truth and light;— No creed is wholly false, old creed or new, Since none is wholly true. Wherefore we Pilgrims bless thee as we go With feeble feet and slow; Light of forgotten Fairyland still lies Upon our cheeks and eyes; And somewhere in the starry waste doth gleam The City of our Dream! BOOK I. SETTING FORTH. In the noontide of my days I had a dream, And in my dream, which seem'd no dream at all, I saw these things which here are written down. And first methought, with terror on my heart, I fled, like many a pilgrim theretofore, From a dark City built beside the sea, Crying, ‘I cannot any longer bear The tumult and the terror and the tears, The sadness, of the City where I dwell; Sad is the wailing of the waters, sad The coming and the going of the sun, And sad the homeless echoes of the streets, Since I have heard that up among the hills There stands the City christen'd Beautiful, Green sited, golden, and with heaven above it Soft as the shining of an angel's hair; And thither comes not rain, or wind, or snow, Nor the bleak blowing of Euroclydon, Nor moans of many miserable men.’ Now in my dream meseem'd that I had known A melancholy neighbour, old and blind, Named Faith, led by a beauteous snow-white hound, Named Peace; and this same Faith, grown worn and weak With wandering up and down the weary ways, Had one day learn'd, high up among the hills, Strange tidings of the City Beautiful, And heard in sooth a far-off melody Of harps and lutes, blown from the heavenly gate. Now, when he spake of this, upon his face There grew a gleam like moonlight upon water, Sweet with exceeding sadness; and at last, Though blind, he had left his lonely home again, And stolen across the valleys silently At midnight; and he had return'd no more. Him, after many melancholy days, And many wrestlings with a darkening doubt, I, Ishmael (lone descendant of a race Who chased the mirage among desert sands), Follow'd in fear; and lo! I fled with speed Like one who flees before some dreadful beast; But just beyond our town I met with one Clad in white robes and named Evangelist, Who, at the threshold of his summer dwelling, Girt round by plenteous harvest, sat and smiled; To whom I cried: ‘O thou who sittest here In thy fair garden girt by golden glebe, Instruct me (for thy beard is white and wise) Which is the pathway to the heavenly City Call'd Beautiful, first of the Land of Light?’ Then said Evangelist, with courteous smile: O Pilgrim, close thine eyes, and wander on; One Faith precedes thee, blind, led by a hound, Else trusting God; and when thou stumblest, rise; And when thou comest among thorns and flints, Praise God and pray; and when in some deep slough Thou flounderest, bless God and struggle through. But chief, be warn'd, to walk with close-shut eyes Is safest, seeing our twin eyes of flesh Mislead us, and a thousand evil things Are made for our temptation. Grant me grace; And I will give thee this brave Book to read, And for the further safety of thy soul Will bind this blessèd bandage o'er thine eyes, To keep thy sight from evil. Though thine eyes Be blind from seeing forward, ne'ertheless Look down thou canst while wandering, and glean The wisdom of the Book.’ A space I paused, Gazing into his coldly happy eyes, Then cried: ‘But thou?—O master, answer me!— Art thou content here in the dales to dwell Nor climb thyself the heavenly heights whereon The wondrous City stands?’ Then with a smile As soft, as still, as is the snake of fire Coil'd up and flickering on some happy hearth, Evangelist replied: ‘My post is here, Not on the mountains, nor a rocky place; He whom I serve hath given me this my task To blindfold pilgrims and to point them on; This house is His, this porch with roses hung, These golden fields; nor can I quit my post Until He sends His own dark Angel down. And on my head methought Evangelist Placed his soft hands in blessing; and my soul, With one long sigh, one glance at the blue heaven, Assented; and methought Evangelist Did blindfold me, and set me on my way, And place the Book within my hands to read, Then softly singing in the summer sheen, Cried, ‘Courage!’ as I wander'd from his sight. And as I wander'd on, not seeing whither, But trusting in some heavenly hand to guide, I, casting down my gaze upon the Book, Read these things, and was little comforted:— In six days God the Lord made heaven and earth, And rested from His labours on the seventh; Dividing firmament from firmament, Fishes He made, and flesh, and flying birds, And, lastly, Man; next, from a rib of Man, Woman. These twain He in a garden set, Naked, and glad, and innocent of heart; But in the centre of the garden placed A Tree for their temptation. Thither came The ancient snake upon his belly crawling, And bade the woman pluck the fruit and eat. And first the woman ate, and then the man, And knew their nakedness, and were ashamed; And furthermore an Angel with a sword Drave them from Eden into the sunless waste. From these twain had the generations come, The million generations of the earth, Bearing the burthen of that primal sin; And whatsoever man is born on earth Is born unto the issues of that sin, Albeit each step he takes is predestined. Further, I read the legend of the Flood, Of Noah and of the building of an Ark, And how the Maker (as a craftsman oft Rejects a piece of labour ill begun) Destroy'd His first work and began again With sorrow and the symbol of the Dove. Much, furthermore, I read of the first race Of shepherds, Abraham's race and Jacob's race; And of the chosen people God deliver'd Out of the land of bondage. Portents burnt, Strange omens came, wild scenes and faces flash'd Before me, and I ever seem'd to hear The rustle of the serpent; till I heard The voice of David cursing to his harp His enemies, and smiting hip and thigh, And holding up his blood-stain'd hands to God. And ever across my soul a vision flash'd Of a most direful Form with robes of fire, A footfall loud as many chariots, A voice like thunder on a mountain-top, And nostrils drinking up with joy divine The crimson sacrifice of flesh and blood; And ever as I read I felt my soul Shake with exceeding fear, and stumbled on With fleeter footsteps; and I fled for hours Ere, with a fascination deep as death, I cast my gaze upon the Book again. And now I read of pale and wild-eyed kings, Of sounding trumpets and of clarions, The clash of hosts in carnage, and the shriek Of haggard prophets standing on the heights, And urging on the host as men urge hounds; As in a mirror, darkly, I beheld The generations drift like vapour past, Driven westward by a whirlwind, while on high The Breath Divine like fire came and went; And, suddenly, the storm-cloud of the world Uplifted,—there was light—stillness and death; All nature lay as one vast battle-field, And cities numberless lay desolate, And crowns were strewn about and broken swords, And everywhere the vulture and the raven Pick'd at the eyeballs of slain kings and churls; And through the world a crimson river of blood Ran streaming, till it wash'd the feet of God. These things I gather'd, trembling like a leaf, And moaning, ‘God of Thunder! save my soul! Destroy me not, Destroyer! Pity me, O Pitiless, but let Thine anger pass!’ And now, methought that I had left my home Behind me, and was far beyond the town, When, suddenly, I heard upon my path A crowd of people hearkening to one Who raised his voice aloud and prophesied. ‘Who speaks?’ I ask'd; and one, with low, deep laugh, Said, ‘Only our old prophet, Hurricane: He began early, and the people applauded; But now the matter hath outgrown his wits, And newer lights are risen.’ Whereon I said: ‘Methinks I know the man; he hath a house Within a suburb of our town, and ever He mocketh all his neighbours and the poor, And praises only God, and priests, and kings.’ And in my dream I heard him, Hurricane, Railing aloud to those who flock'd around: ‘Scum of the Maker's scorn, what seek ye here? Go, thou whose sin is black, and kiss the lash; Haste, thou whose skin is white, and strike for kings. O miserable generation, foam That flashes from the Maker's chariot-wheels, What do you crave for, shrieking for a sign? See yonder o'er your heads the sun and stars Hang like bright apples on the Eternal Tree, And day comes, and the night is wonderful, And æon after æon, 'spite your groans, The eternal Order stands. What seek ye, worms? To shake away the slime of that first curse, Spoken when ye were fashion'd out of dust? It is the mission of the worm to crawl; No snake is he, and cannot even sting The heel that bruises him. Crawl on for ever; Obey your masters here and yonder in heaven— Ye cannot slough your sin or quit your curse.’ Then a voice deep and rough, as from the throat Of some strong wight, responded: ‘Softly, master! What profit comes of railing? We who hear, An we were worms indeed, might creep and die; But being men, we deem thy counsel blind, And all thy words as impotent as sparks Blown by the bellows from my smithy fire. Nay, those thou bidst us honour are (I swear By Tubal Cain, the founder of my craft!) The plagues of this green earth. I know them well, I rate them, I! the monsters of this earth, Blind priests and prophets blind, and blindest kings, And conquerors slaying in the name of God.’ Then Hurricane made answer, while a groan Went through the inmost ranks of those who heard: ‘I tell you, ye are dust of evil, things For mighty powers to work with. God is strength, His blessing makes strong men, and they are strong Who blister you and bind you to your doom, Black slaves and white. Worms, do ye rave of rights? I tell you, He who fashion'd you for pain, And set you in a sad and sunless world, Scatters your rights as the eternal sea Loosens the fading foam-bells from its hair. What man cried out, “There is no God at all”? I swear to you, by sun, and stars, and moon, By hunger, by starvation and disease, By death, that there is God omnipotent, Awful, a King, a strong God! yea, indeed, The Maker of the whirlwind and the worm, The judgment waiting in the heavens o'erhead, The vengeance burning in the earth beneath, The end of sin, the doom no man eludes, Not even at the very gates of death!’ Now in my dream I shudder'd, for methought I heard the living echo of the Book; So, sick and sad at heart, I turn'd away, And hasten'd, desolate, I knew not whither. Methought I wander'd on and on, for long, Shadow'd with sorrow, smitten through with sin, Not heeding whither, blindfold, caring not If the next step of my sad pilgrimage Should be into some nameless, open grave. But as I crept across the darken'd earth, O'er which the sad sky shed a sobbing rain, One cried to me, ‘Poor soul, take shelter here!’ And following the summons of the voice I felt the cold touch of an outstretch'd hand, Which led me darkly through an open door, Up steps of stone, into some unknown dwelling. Then said I, pale, blindfolded, Book in hand: ‘Who spake? whose hand was that which led me hither? And what strange dwelling have I enter'd in?’ And sharper, shriller than an eunuch's voice One answer'd, ‘But for that same blinding band Across thine eyes thou for thyself couldst see— Perchance, good man, my name is known to thee, Iconoclast,—called sometimes “Gibe-at-God,” Whose name hath travell'd over the wide earth.’ Then all my spirit darken'd for a moment, For I had heard the name said under breath With Satan's and with Moloch's and with Baal's, And my young soul had loathed the man who mock'd All that the world deems holy. But as I stood, Troubled and timorous, he did laugh aloud, Saying: ‘My name hath reach'd thee, I perceive, And, though thou deem'st it evil, I have hope To gain thy good opinion presently .... Whence dost thou come? and whither dost thou go?’ THE PILGRIM. I come from yonder City beside the sea, And seek the Beautiful City of the Lord. ICONOCLAST. And dost thou think to gain that City's gate (If such a city there be, which travellers doubt) Blindfolded, with that bandage on thine eyes? THE PILGRIM. Yea, verily; for a good man set it there, Evangelist.—But wherefore dost thou laugh? ICONOCLAST. O foolish Pilgrim, wherefore did thy Lord, Whoever made thee, or receives from thee Credit for having made thee, give thee sight, If thou consentest not to look, or see? THE PILGRIM. I know not. These are mysteries. Yet I know, Evangelist did bid me journey thus. ICONOCLAST. I know the fellow, a fat trencher slave, He wears no bandage, he, nor goeth forth On pilgrimage, but sitteth in the sun, Right prosperous, and eyes his golden glebe. O fool, to be persuaded by this priest Out of thy birthright; to be blind and dark; The sun to see not, or the stars and moon, Or any light that shines; to turn thy face Into the tomb of dead intelligence; To quit mortality and be a mole! THE PILGRIM. My townsman, Faith, precedes me: he is blind, And yet he journeys safely through the land. ICONOCLAST. Leave faith to Faith; since the good, simple soul Is eyeless, let his other senses thrive! But thou hast eyes, and eyes were given thee To see with; that to doubt, were blasphemy! THE PILGRIM. Why should I see? This Book held in my hand Assures me 'tis a miserable world, Base, burthen'd, and most bleak to look upon. ICONOCLAST. See for thyself! Wherefore consult a Book Upon a point of eyesight? Look, and see! THE PILGRIM. I dare not. I am stricken dumb and sad, After the testimony written here. ICONOCLAST. If there be misery in the ways thou treadest, If this thine earth be wretched and unclean, It is because so many walk in blindness, And read the dreary gospel written there. THE PILGRIM. How may that be? God fashion'd all things well; And only by man's sin did all grow sad. ICONOCLAST. Assuredly; God fashion'd all things well. THE PILGRIM. And all had still been well had man not eaten The bitter Tree of Knowledge, and been shamed. ICONOCLAST. Softly, good friend; that is the one good tree Adam ne'er tasted, not to speak of Eve Or any wiser woman. Cast that Book Over thy shoulder! Leave the dreary dream; Forswear the apple and the fig-leaf; cease To credit fables old of fire and flood; Quit gloomy visions and crude eastern nights Of legendary horror: in a word, Cast off thy bandage and thine ignorance, And look abroad upon thy destiny! So saying, with one quick movement of his hand, Iconoclast did snatch from off my brows The bandage placed there by Evangelist; And lo! I scream'd, and with my trembling fingers Cover'd mine eyes, then, trembling like a leaf, Perused the stranger's face, and saw it full Of many wrinkles, and a snake-like sneer Playing about the edges of the lips. And it was noon, noon of a cold grey day, A silvern, melancholy light in heaven, All calm, the prospects and the distances Sharp and distinct to vision, but no sun. ‘Where am I?’ next I murmur'd; and, ‘Behold,’ Answer'd that other, ‘on an eminence Thou standest, named Mount Clear; for all the air Is crystal pure, and hither rise no mists. Follow me higher; far above my dwelling I have built a solitary garden-seat, Commanding a great prospect o'er the earth.’ Methought I follow'd, and we gain'd the height, And, full of wonder now, I look'd abroad. I saw great valleys and green watery wastes, Deep-shelter'd woods and marshes full of mist, And rivers winding seaward; then, mine eyes Following the winding rivers, I beheld, Far away, silent, solemn, grey, and still, The waters of the Ocean; and thereon Sat, like a sea-bird on the ribbèd sand, A City that I knew to be mine own; But following the windings of the coast I beheld other Cities like mine own, All hungrily set beside the wash of waves, Looking expectant, seaward; and from each Came solitary figures as of men, Mere specks upon the highways and the fields, All toiling, as it seem'd, with constant feet To those green slopes whereon I stood at gaze. Then as I look'd, and wonder'd, in mine ear The old man murmur'd: ‘Lo, thou lookest on The Cities of the Nations of the Earth, Each crouching by the sad shores of the Sea Infinite, dreadful, mighty, without bound; And in each City thou dost look upon A different legend and a different God Lengthen man's misery and make him mad; Further, from City unto City have gone Tidings of that same City Beautiful Thou seekest; at the gate of each there sits An arch-priest, like thine own Evangelist, Blindfolding those who wearily set forth; And these, the Pilgrims thou beholdest now As specks afar, go stumbling sadly on; And if they perish not upon the way, As ninety-nine in every hundred perish, Hither among the hills of ironstone They, slowly ascending, by such hands as mine Are of their blinded ignorance relieved.’ Whereat I cried, in bitterness of heart: ‘I see, but seeing comfort find I none, But all thou showest me is sick and sad, For lo! the things I fled from, the sad Earth, The melancholy City, the grey Heaven, And the vast silence of the unfathomed Sea!’ And turning to Iconoclast, I cried: ‘Thy words are shallow, and thy counsel blind! Lo! thou hast snatch'd the bandage from my eyes, And I perceive the fables of the Book; What shall I do, and whither shall I go?’ ‘Haste homeward!’ smiling said Iconoclast; ‘Back to thine earthly City, work thy work, And dream of Cities in the clouds no more.’ But with a moan, uplifting hands, I cried: Whither, oh whither? To return is Death, For mine own City is dreadful, and the Sea Hath voices, and the homeless winds of woe Wander with white feet wearily on the deep; And every slope beside the sea is green With the dead generations; and I seek A City fairer and not perishable, Peaceable and holy, in the Land of Light!’ Then did Iconoclast, with bitter scorn, Cry:‘'Tis an infant moaning for the moon, For the moon's phantom in the running brook. O fool! there is no City Beautiful Beyond these Cities of the Earth thou seest!’ But turning now my back upon the Sea, And on my native City, I beheld A mighty land of hills. There, far away, Beyond the pastoral regions at my feet, Beyond the quiet lanes and wayside wells, Rose mountains, darken'd by deep woods of pine, With air-hung bridges spanning cataracts, And rainbows o'er the waters hovering; Mists moved, celestial shadows came and went, While higher, dim against the blue, there rose Peaks soft as sleep, white with eternal snow. ‘What land is that?’ I question'd; and the other Answer'd: ‘I know not; nay, nor seek to know; For those be perilous regions, with an air Too thin for man to breathe; yet many, I wis, Have travell'd thither (O the weary way!), But never a one hath hither come again. And how they fared I know not, yet I dream That never one doth reach those frigid heights, But on the crags and 'mid the pathless woods They perish, and the skeleton hands of Frost Cling to them, breaking up their bleaching bones!’ But now I cried: ‘O fool that I have been To talk with such a shallow soul so long! A scoffing voice like to the mocking-bird's, The dreary echo of a hollow sound Bred in an empty heart. For, lo! I see The land afar, and, though the ways be dire, Thither I fare, since, far among the heights, Beyond the scoffer's voice, beyond these vales, Beyond the weary wailings of the sea, First in its place the Heavenly City stands!’ So stood I trembling in the act to go, When grey Iconoclast, with cynic sneer, Not angry, cried: ‘Stay yet!—I had forgot! Not far beyond these valleys lies indeed A City wondrous smiling to the sight Like that which thou art seeking. In its streets Full many a prosperous pilgrim findeth peace.’ And, smiling bitterly, as if in scorn, He added: ‘O'er the mighty earth its fame Hath travell'd on four winds! Who hath not heard Of this same City of Christopolis?’ Then I upleapt i' the air and waved my hands. ‘The name! the name!—He built it with His blood!— I charge thee on thy life, point out the way!’ ‘Thou canst not miss it,’ said Iconoclast; ‘For if the milestone or the finger-post Should fail thee, only seek the open road, And there beshrew me if thou meetest not With many of its priestly citizens, Who will direct thee onward willingly. Still, if thou lovest wisdom, be advised— Turn back and hasten home. Christopolis, Methinks, is not the City of thy quest.’ ‘How knowest thou that?’ I cried, full eagerly. ‘Hast thou thyself fared thither?’ ‘Verily,’ Answered the greybeard; ‘more, within its streets I first drew breath!’ THE PILGRIM. I understand thee not. Born there, and yet, alas! thou sittest here? ICONOCLAST. I could not choose. She from whose womb I came, More mighty than my yet unwoven will, Would have it so!—and thus on golden streets I ran, and under golden fanes I played, And in the splendour of Christopolis I fed and throve, till, weary of so much light, While yet a fleet-heel'd boy I fled away. THE PILGRIM. Fled? From thy birthplace? from thy happiness? O fool, to quit the paths and ways of peace! ICONOCLAST. I was not peaceful in those peaceful ways, I did not love my birthplace. So I fled. THE PILGRIM. Was it not fair? ICONOCLAST. Most fair. THE PILGRIM. And holy? ICONOCLAST. In sooth, My nurses said so much. THE PILGRIM. Yet thou art here! ICONOCLAST. I loved my freedom better far than fanes: Within those scented shrines I could not breathe. Besides, the people were idolaters,— Fools of the fig-leaf, blind inheritors Of that sad symbol of a slaughter'd God. I left them, and I came to warn the world Against the follies I had left behind, Or haply now and then with this weak arm To aid some miserable human thing Their citizens have hunted even hither!’ He added, with a strange and inward smile: ‘Go thither, if thou wilt—seek out its gates— Remember that I warn'd thee 'twas in vain.’ More might his lips have spoken garrulously, But swiftly down the silent heights I ran, Thrusting the Book into my breast; and now Methought my soul was wroth against the man, Iconoclast. Most fleet of foot I fled, Until I reach'd the shadowy vale below, Through whose green heart there wound a dusty way Where many men and women came and went. But as I leapt a brook to gain the road, Suddenly on mine ears there swept a sound, A tumult, then a tramp of horses' feet, Sharp yelp of hounds, and all the cries o' the chase. Wondering I stood, and lo! across the meads, There came a naked man who shriek'd for dread, Speeding as swift as any dappled deer; And close behind him silent blood-hounds ran, Swiftly, with crimson nostrils to the ground; And after these came a great company, Priests in red robes, and hoary crownèd Kings, And pallid Queens with grey and golden hair, With countless savage slaves that ran afoot, And huntsmen, shrieking, ‘In the name of God!’ And much I fear'd the hounds behind the man, Lolling their crimson tongues to drink his life; And lo! they would have caught and rent the man, But, suddenly, he sprang with one swift bound Over the threshold of a house of stone, A lowly place white-visaged like a shrine, That at the corner of a little wood Stood with a spire that pointed up to heaven. Therein he leapt and vanish'd through a door That stands for ever open; and the train Were following when there rose beneath the porch A figure like an angel with one hand Outreaching; and they dare not enter in, But with a sullen roar, clashing like waves, Broke at the threshold, foam'd, and were repell'd. Then, gazing past the Spirit, I beheld A chancel and an altar, and the man, With panting mouth and wild eyes backward gazing, Cast prone before the altar, faint with fear; And further, full of wonder, raising eyes, I read these words written above the porch— ‘Iconoclast hath built this church to God!’ Then did I pray and weep, crying aloud: ‘Lord, let me judge not, since Thou art my Judge, For I perceive an angel bright doth guard The Temple of the Scoffer, and the same May be Thy servant, though his place be set Outside Thy City, in a rocky place.’ Then turning, I gazed upward, and behold! On the cold eminence above my head, I saw Iconoclast in milk-white robes Walking with sunlight on his reverend hair; And as he walk'd upon the golden sward He scatter'd seeds and call'd, and many doves, That rear'd their young beneath his lonely eaves, Came fluttering down in answer to his call, Making a snow around him, and were fed. BOOK II. STRANGERS AND PILGRIMS. And now my path was on a public road, And where I walk'd methought the weary air Was full of lamentations; for the sick Lay on the roadside basking in the sun, The leper with his sores, the paralysed Moveless as stone, the halt and lame and blind, And many beggars pluck'd me by the sleeve, And when I fled shriek'd curses after me; And my tears fell, and my knees knock'd together, And I fled faster, crying: ‘That first curse Still darkens all! Oh, City Beautiful, Where art thou?—for these ways are sad to tread.’ Even as I spake I heard a gentle voice Close by me saying, ‘Good morrow, gentle Sir; 'Tis sweet and pleasant weather;’ and I cried, Quickly, not looking in his face who spake: ‘I am in haste, and cannot pause for speech— Farewell!’ but, lo, the other touch'd my arm, Saying: ‘One word, I prithee, ere thou fliest. In yonder village, Poppythorpe by name— Pastor I dwell—my name is Pitiful. I know thine errand. Prithee, since 'tis late, Accept the shelter of my roof this night.’ THE PILGRIM. I cannot rest. A wind behind me blows, And like a cloud I travel darkly on. PITIFUL. And whither away?—Stay, from thy wayworn face I guess;—thou goest to Christopolis? THE PILGRIM. Again that name. Oh help me! Guide me thither. PITIFUL. Most gladly. But, if thou wilt trust in me, Rest for to-night, to-morrow fare afresh; From hence the City is a weary way. THE PILGRIM. God help me!—I would fain not rest at all Until the hunger of my heart is fed. But tell me of those wretched on the road: Whence have they come, and whither do they go? PITIFUL. Those wretched are but Pilgrims like thyself— They, too, are crawling to Christopolis. Ah, look not on them, or thy heart may fail— For few will ever gain the golden Gate. Then all my force was broken, and I leant Heavily on the arm of my sad guide, A pale tall wight with soft eyes red from tears, And through a wicket gate across the fields We pass'd, and came unto a lowly house,— A peaceful house beside a running rill; And Pitiful did bring me food and milk; And Sentiment and Sensibility, His two grave daughters, made me up a bed Deep, soft, and drowsy; that same night, methought, I slept therein; upon the morrow morn Rose languid, and went forth upon my way. The road was busy still with eager folk, Coming and going, but I saw them not, For I bethought me of the blessèd Book, And drew it from my heart, and as I walk'd I read its solemn pages once again. And now I read a tale so sad and sweet, That all the darker matter of the Book Dissolved away like mists around a star. And I forgot the thunders of the Word Spoken in Sinai to the bloody tribe, Seeing a white Shape rise with heavenly eyes By the still sleeping Lake of Galilee— And Him, that Shape, the sick, and halt, and lame, The miserable millions of the earth, Follow'd in joy; and by His side walk'd women, Tall and most fair, fair flowers that grew 'mong thorns Like to the Hûleh lily; and the earth Blossom'd beneath the kiss of His bright feet. But, suddenly, out of the gathering cloud Above the footsteps of that Man Divine, Jehovah's eyes, bloodthirsty, terrible, Flash'd at the pallid, patient, upraised face; And He, the Paraclete, the Son, the Lamb, Trembled and held His hand upon His heart, Crying: ‘O God, My God, if it may be, Have mercy on Me, do not shed My blood!’ Whereon, methought, before my sight there swam A vision of a night sown thick with stars Like leopard spots, the deep dead dark below The flashes of the torches round a town, And the shrill sound of that last victim's shriek To an omnipotent and vengeful God. Now as I read, methought I stopp'd mine ears, And fled in horror from the thoughts that surged Within mine own sad soul; and all the earth Seem'd hateful to me, yea, the scent of flowers, The savour of the new-mown hay, the breath Of browsing sheep and kine, all odour of life, Grew sick and sacrificial; yea, mine eyes Shed tears like blood; and my soul sicken'd, saying: ‘How should this God have mercy upon men, Seeing He spared not His anointed Son?’ Aloud I spake in agony of heart, And as I ceased there came unto my side One clad in crimson, bearing in his hand A snow-white staff; and Time upon his hair Had snow'd full long, but in his jet-black eyes There burn'd a bitter and a baleful light. ‘Peace!’ cried he, lifting up his wand on high: ‘Peace—thou blasphemest!’ Starting like a thief, To have my thoughts so angrily surprised, I gazed into the other's angry face In question, but, ere yet my lips could speak, That other, sinking lower his shrill voice, Proceeded: ‘What art thou, that thou shouldst judge The cruelty or mercy of the Lord? A Pilgrim, by the hunger in thy face— Perchance a Pilgrim to Christopolis? Nay, silence yet—and pluck not at my robe— My guess was right, and to Christopolis Indeed thou farest; thank the Lord thy God They heard thee not who ope and shut the Gate, Else surely would they never let thee in. For less than thou hast harbour'd in thy heart We hunted down a human wolf last night, And would have slain him as a sacrifice, But that an evil spirit interposed!’ Then did I tremble, for in him who spake I recognised one of that hunting train Whom I beheld upon the level meads That hour I parted from Iconoclast. Wherefore my heart woke in me angrily, And in a low and bitter voice I said, ‘I saw that chase,—and blest the holy form Who from your cruelty deliver'd him.’ White as sheet-lightning flash'd that other's face, And his voice trembled crying: ‘Once again Thou dost blaspheme! He did deny God's justice, And God in justice gave him to our hands.’ ‘Nay then,’ I answered, ‘God, for such a deed, Was much too pitiful.’ ‘Fool!’ the other cried; ‘Did yonder semblance cheat thee? Did thine eyes Fail to perceive that yonder seeming shrine, Erected by accurst Iconoclast, Was but the brilliant-colour'd mouth of Hell? And did Iconoclast (for I perceive Thy lips have talk'd with that arch-enemy!) So cheat thy vision that thou knew'st him not For what he is, black Belial and a fiend? I tell thee, though his hair be white as snow, His face most holy, sweet, and venerable, He is the procurer of Satan's self; And those white doves thou saw'st around his head Devils attendant, taking from his hand The crumbs of guile, the seed of blasphemy! His spell is on thee yet—his seal is there, Over thine eyelids,—down upon thy knees, Pray God to shrive thee from thy hateful sin Of that dark speech with the abominable, And even yet thy sinful soul may see The light and glory of Christopolis.’ Then spirit-shaken, broken, and appall'd, Part by the horror in the stranger's eyes, Part by the dim and darken'd memory Of what my soul had read within the Book, I cried aloud, and fell upon my knees, And o'er my head the multitudinous clouds Took dark and formless likenesses of One Down-looking in His wrath; and as I pray'd, I did remember how Iconoclast Had blacken'd and reviled the Holy Book, And wickedly blasphemed the very God. Wherefore I moan'd: ‘Forgive me, Holy One! By Thy Son's blood forgive me, for I knew not With what false tongue I spake.’ Then to my feet Uprising, tottering as one drunk with wine, I still beheld the stranger watching me With cold, calm eyes. ‘What man art thou?’ I cried, ‘How shall I know that thou too art not false, Some devil in disguise?’ Full scornfully The other smiled. ‘By this same garb I wear, And by this wand I wave within my hand, Know then my priestly rank and privilege. My name is Direful, and high-priest am I Within the Holy City, where I preach God's thunders and the lightnings of the Cross. And if thou askest humbly, with strong sense Of thine own undeserving, I perchance May help thee through the golden City's Gates.’ ‘Thou!’—cried I—‘thou!’ Then with a sob I said, Clutching the pallid priest's red raimenthem, ‘Is it not written that those Gates stand wide To all whose souls are weary and would rest?’ ‘To all whose souls are weary of their sin,’ The other said, ‘and seek to glorify His name who built the City with His blood.’ THE PILGRIM. O pole-star of our sleepless sea of pain— Still shines He there? DIREFUL. Whom meanest thou? THE PILGRIM. Christ the King! DIREFUL. He reigns for ever through His deputies, Christ's Vicars, Servants, and anointed Kings— These to His glory day and night upraise Hosannahs, building with their blessed hands Temples, and fanes, and shrines of purest gold. There mayst thou, as a fringe upon the skirt Of His bright glory, hang for evermore, Swayed into rapture by each heavenly throb Of that divine and ever-bleeding Heart, Which even as a raiment weareth those Who do partake its glory and believe. THE PILGRIM. Ah me! if this be sooth, what shall I do To win such rapture and deserved the same? DIREFUL. Deserve it thou canst never, but perchance, Thine own iniquities remembering, Thou yet mayst win it. First, mark well—this gift Comes from no merit and no power of thine, Who, if God used thee after thy deserts, Would now be trembling in eternal flame, Or 'neath His heel be crushed to nothingness! THE PILGRIM. What have I done to merit such a doom? DIREFUL. Done?—sum it in two little words—thou art. THE PILGRIM. If that be sin, God made me, and I am. DIREFUL. God, in His mercy, suffers thee to crawl, As He doth suffer worms and creeping things; God, in His justice, might obliterate Thee and all creatures living from the earth. THE PILGRIM. Not so; that duty the created owes To the Creator, the Creator, too, Owes the created. God hath given me life, I thank my God if life a blessing is, How may I bless Him if it proves a curse? DIREFUL. Fool! juggle not with words, lest the red levin Fall down and blast thee. Rather on thy knees Crave, as a boon, from the All-Terrible, What thou mayst ne'er solicit as a right. THE PILGRIM. I pray! I pray! Father, Thou hear'st, I pray! Nay, have I not by gracious words and deeds, By holy living, love for all my kind, Pray'd to and praised, loved goodness for Thy sake? DIREFUL. Nay, neither words, nor deeds, nor love avail— They are but other names for vanity— Only believe and thou mayst gain the Gate. THE PILGRIM. Instruct me further. What must I believe? DIREFUL. In God Triune, yet One—in God the Father, In God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost— In God's eternal Book, and in His Church; In God's fair City, builded under Heaven, And read'd upon the hundred thrones of Hell! THE PILGRIM. Why not? Belief is easy. Only show The City and its Gateway, and I swear No soul shall flout me for my lack of faith! Yea, take me to divine Christopolis— Let me be sure that shining City is— Let me upon its fair perfections gaze— And I will own indeed so blest a place Transcends my best deserving, and will thank That gracious God, who made me what I am, For giving me this precious gift of life! Thus speaking we had wander'd slowly on A little way upon the dusty road; But now behind us, riding hastily There came that glorious hunting company Which sought to slay the lonely hunted man. And unto him who spake with me there strode A slave, who held an empty-saddled steed Bitted with gold and bright caparison'd; Him Direful beckon'd, then to me he turn'd, Crying, ‘Fare forward!—there beyond the hill Lieth the shining City of thy quest.’ So saying, lightly to his seat he sprang, And in the track of that same hunting throng Prick'd on his eager steed. Then, sighing deep, I gazed around me, on the weary way Strewn with the weary and the miserable, And every face was lighted with the flame Of famine; yea, and all like bloodshot stars Shone forward the one way; but ah! the limbs Were feeble, and the weary feet were sore, And some upon the wayside fell and moan'd, And many lay as white and cold as stone With thin hands cross'd in prayer upon their rags. Meantime there flash'd along on fiery wheels Full many a glorious company which bare Aloft the crimson Cross, and mighty priests Glode by on steeds bridled with glittering gold, And delicate wantons on white palfreys pass'd With soft eyes downcast as they told their beads, And few of these on those who fell and died Look'd down, but seem'd with all their spirits bent To reach the golden Gate ere fall of night— Only the priests stoop'd sometimes o'er the dead, And made the hurried sign o' the Cross, and went. Now as I gazed and sicken'd in despair, Because my force within seem'd failing fast, I met two glittering upturn'd eyes That from the wayside grass regarded me; And lo! I saw, upon two crutches leaning, A cripple youth with gold hair like a maid's, A pale face thin as is a skeleton's, And thin soft hands, blue-vein'd and waxen white; And pitiful and weak he would have seem'd But for the light within his eyes, which shone Most starlike yet most baleful, fraught with flame That ne'er was kindled in a vestal shrine. He meeting now my gaze of wonder, smiled, And such a smile wear wicked elfin things That in the lustre of the moonlight live And dance i' the starry dew. ‘Well met,’ he cried, In shrillest treble sharp as any bell, ‘Well met, good Pilgrim! Stand a space, I pray, Yea, stand, and buy a song.’ Then did I mark He bare within his hand long printed strings Of ballads, and, as ballad-singers use, Stood with his arms outreaching and intoning Praise of his wares. ‘I prithee, Pilgrim, buy! Songs of all sorts I carry—songs for maids, For sucking souls, for folks on pilgrimage, Songs of Satanas and of Christ the King— Come, buy, buy; for with the thrift o' the sale I hope betimes to buy myself an ass, Mounted whereon, full gallop, I may gain The golden Gates, nor rot upon the road With those who fare a-foot.’ And, while his eyes Gleam'd wickedly and merrily, he clear'd His throat, and in an elfin voice he sang:— JESUS OF NAZARETH. Tomb'd from the heavenly blue, Who lies in dreamless death? The Jew, Jesus of Nazareth! Shrouded in black He lies, He doth not stir a limb, His eyes Closed up like pansies dim. The old creeds and the new He blest with his sweet breath, This Jew, Jesus of Nazareth! His brows with thorns are bound, His hands and feet are lead; All round His tomb the sands stretch red. Oh, hark! who sobs, who sighs Around His place of death— ‘Arise, Jesus of Nazareth!’ O'er head, like birds on wing, Float shapes in white robes drest; They sing, But cannot break His rest. They sing for Christ's dear sake; ‘The hour is here,’ each saith; ‘Awake, Jesus of Nazareth!’ Silent He sleeps, thorn-crown'd, He doth not hear or stir, No sound Comes from His sepulchre. ‘Awake!’ those angels sing; ‘Arise, and vanquish Death, O King! Jesus of Nazareth!’ Too late!—where no light creeps Lies the pale vanquish'd one— He sleeps Sound, for His dream is done! Tomb'd from the heavenly blue, Sleeps, with no stir, no breath The Jew, Jesus of Nazareth! Some stood and hsten'd, others cross'd themselves And hurried past, one shriek'd out, ‘Antichrist!’ And as he ceased a troop of hooded forms, Women black-stoled, with crosses in their hands, Passed swiftly by, and some at him who sang Glanced sidelong, laughing with a sign obscene; Answering that sign the cripple sang again:— MARY MAGDALEN. I saw in the Holy City, when all the people slept, The shape of a woeful woman, who look'd at heaven, and wept. Loose o'er her naked shoulders trembled her night-black hair; Her robe was ragged and rent, and her feet were bleeding and bare. And, lo! in her hands she carried a vessel with spices sweet, And she cried, ‘Where are Thou, Master? I come to anoint Thy feet.’ Then I touch'd her on the shoulder, ‘What thing are thou?’ I said; And she stood and gazed upon me with eyes like the eyes of the dead. But I saw the painted colour flash on her cheeks and lips, While she stood and felt in the vessel with tremulous finger-tips. And she answer'd never a word, but stood in the lonely light With the evil of earth upon her, and the darkness of death and night. And I knew her then by her beauty, her sin and the sign of her shame, And touch'd her again more gently, and sadly named her name. She heard, and she did not answer; but her tears began to fall, And again, ‘Where art Thou, Master?’ I heard her thin voice call. And she would have straightway left me, but I held her fast, and said, While the chill wind moan'd around us, and the stars shone overhead, ‘O Mary, where is thy Master? Where does He hide His face? The world awaits His coming, but knows not the time or the place. ‘O Mary, lead me to Him—He loved thee deep and true, Since thou hast risen to find Him, He must be risen too.’ Then the painted lips made answer, while the dead eyes gazed on me, ‘I have sought Him all through His City, and yonder in Galilee. ‘I have sought Him and not found Him, I have search'd in every land, Though the door of the tomb was open, and the shroud lay shrunk in the sand. ‘Long through the years I waited, there in the shade of the tomb, Then I rose and went to meet Him, out in the world's great gloom. ‘And I took pollution with me, wherever my footsteps came, Yea, I shook my sin on the cities, my sin and the signs of my shame. ‘Yet I knew if I could find Him, and kneel and anoint His feet, That His gentle hands would bless me, and our eyes at last would meet, ‘And my sin would fall and leave me, and peace would fill my breast, And there in the tomb He rose from, I could lie me down and rest.’ Tall in the moonlit City, pale as some statue of stone, With the evil of earth upon her, she stood and she made her moan. And away on the lonely bridges, or on the brink of the stream, The pale street-walker heard her, a voice like a voice in a dream. For, lo! in her hands she carried a vessel with spices sweet, And she cried, ‘Where art Thou, Master? I come to anoint Thy feet.’ Then my living force fell from me, and I stood and watch'd her go From shrine to shrine in the daylight, with feeble feet and slow. And the stars look'd down in sorrow, and the earth lay black beneath, And the sleeping City was cover'd with shadows of night and death, While I heard the faint voice wailing afar in the stony street, ‘Where art Thou, Master, Master? I come to anoint Thy feet.’ Then said I, creeping close to him who sang, ‘God help thy folly! Surely thou dost frame Lays for mad moonlight things, not mortal men Who soberly on holy business fare, Seeking the solemn City—’ In my face The cripple laugh'd, then with forefinger lean Outstretching, and his great eyes glittering, He cried, ‘Who prates of moonshine? He who seeks The moonshine City?’ Then I turn'd away, And with a darken'd face was passing on, Much anger on my heart, when, suddenly Sinking his voice, while his great eyes grew fill'd With tearful dew, the singer cried, ‘Fare on! God help thee, brother—God make sure for thee The City of thy dream!’ My sad soul stirr'd By that new tone of pity in the voice, I paused again, and, on the crippled form Glancing in wonder and in tenderness, Said, ‘I have strength, and I shall gain the Gate! But thou?’ Again the cripple's lineaments Changed into wickedness and mockery, And loud he laugh'd, as shrill as elfins laugh Seated in fairy rings under the moon, And elfin-like he seem'd from head to foot, While on his cheek and in his lustrous eyes The pallid moon-dew gleam'd. ‘Hie on!’ he cried; ‘Fly thou as fast as any roc, be sure That I shall reach that ne'er-discover'd bourne As soon as thou!’ Thereon I turn'd my back And set my face against the steepening hill; And, as I climb'd among the climbing folk, I heard the cripple's voice afar behind Singing a weird and wondrous melody; And even when I heard the voice no more The sound was ringing in my heart and brain, Like wicked music heard at dead of night Within some fairy circle by the sea. But still I fared with never-faltering feet, Nor rested, till I gain'd the height and saw, Far down below me, strangely glittering, A valley like a cloud, and in its midst A shining light that sparkled like a star. BOOK III. EGLANTINE. Now, presently I saw the countless spires Like fiery fingers pointing up to heaven, And 'neath the spires were gleaming cupolas, Columns of marble under roofs of gold, Netted together in the summer haze, And lower yet, like golden rivers, ran The streets and byways, winding serpentine. Still was the heaven o'erhead, and sunset-lit; One white cloud, pausing like a canopy, Enroof'd the wonder of a thousand domes. And now the highway that my footsteps trod Grew populous, and every face was set Towards the hot sunshine of the shining walls; And lo, methought, with joy, ‘At last I see The City of my dream!’ Even as I spake, The river of life upraised me, surging back To let a glorious company sweep by, And struggling in the stream I recognised Another hunting throng like that which sought To feast its hounds upon the naked man:— Kings in their crowns, Queens in their golden hair, Priests in red garments, filleted with gold, Huntsmen with hounds, and couriers that a-foot Ran crying, ‘Way there! in the name of God!’ Beneath the fierce tramp of their horses' hoofs Some fell, and groan'd; they paused not, but swept on; And after those were vanish'd with a blare Of trumpets, into the far City's gate, Came other trains as shining and as swift, Until mine eyes were dazzled utterly. Then, casting eyes on those surrounding me, Many in rags I saw, who shriek'd for alms, And some that sturdily strode on with wares, Others that danced and sang, and others still That dragg'd their feeble limbs along in pain. But here and there, with crosses sewn in silk Upon their bosoms, walk'd mysterious men, To whose long skirts the halt and maim'd did cling, Though still they heeded not, but in a trance Walk'd on with eyes upon the far-off spires. Then did I wonder, looking eagerly For one of friendlier aspect than the rest Whom I might question; but each man I mark'd Seem'd struggling forward with no other thought Than how to gain the shining shelter first. Swept onward swiftly in mine own despite, As in a sultry sea I gasp'd for breath, Until, the highway widening as it went, I saw upon its side a grassy knoll, Whereon, down-gazing at the passing folk, Sat one most strangely dight in Eastern wise, With robe and caftan girdled round his waist, His feet bare, in his hand a leafy branch. A wight he was of less than common height, With world-worn face, and eyes suffused with dew Of easy tears, but when he spake his voice Was like a fountain in a shady place. Now, as he spake, some laugh'd, and others cursed, Shaking their clenchèd fists into his face; But most went by unheeding and unseeing. But, as two ships made in the self-same land, Although they meet amid a fleet of sail, By some strange signal or mysterious sign At once do know each other and exchange Kind greetings in mid-ocean, so it chanced That I and this same curious wayfarer Finding our eyes meet suddenly together, Smiled kindly on each other unaware;— And though I ne'er had seen the face before, Methought ‘Thank God, at last I find a friend’— So struggling from the throng, with elbowthrust, Amid the cries and blows of those I push'd, I fought my way unto the stranger's side. Him did I greet, and instantly he smiled A brother's answer, and ful soon we stood In gracious converse, looking on the throng That like a river roll'd beneath our feet, And on the glistening celestial towers. STRANGER. A mighty company! and each one there Bearing his own dumb hunger in his heart. God grant they find the loving cheer they seek In yonder City; but, in sooth, I fear It is too small to feed so many mouths. THE PILGRIM. O tell me—for I hunger to know all—. And thou of that same City art, methinks, A happy and a blest inhabitant; See I God's City?—Name its name to me, For I have dream'd it over many years. STRANGER. Thou seest the City of Christopolis. THE PILGRIM. Rejoice!—the sweet name echoes in my heart!— It is indeed the City of my dream! STRANGER. Be not so sure. All those who journey thither Conceive the same until they enter in, But, having enter'd, many exchange their mirth For lamentation, even as I have done. THE PILGRIM. Thou dwell'st there? Thou dost know it? 'Tis thy home? STRANGER. Home have I none—even as the field-mouse makes Her brittle dwelling in the fallow-field, Alone, unfriended, houseless I abide— There's not a door in yonder shining place Would open to receive me; not a space In the necropolis that stands hard by Wherein my weary bones might find a grave. I went there, and I sought a refuge, friend; The glimmer of the gold-heaps dazzled me, And I crept out upon the open earth. THE PILGRIM. What curse is on thee, then?—what blight of sin?— Thou art not tainted? Even if thou art, Repent, and be forgiven, and enter in. The stranger smiled, and somewhat bitterly, With petulant ring in his low voice, replied:— ‘I have repented; but 'tis not my sin That makes me exile from Christopolis. Long years ago, a melancholy Man, Who went abroad and wrought in love for men, Was crucified upon the very spot Where stands the midmost Church and inmost shrine. This place a desert was in those old days, But of that martyr's seed hath sprung like wheat This golden harvest of a thousand spires; And by his name the City is called, and now The hosts within it hail the martyr'd “King,” Yea, “King of Kings, Almighty, Very God,” And drag to death and direful punishment All heretics who kneel not at his tomb. Now mark me, though I love his memory, Because of his abundant charities, And still the more because they martyr'd him, I will not give to any man of earth The worship I reserve for very God.’ Whereat I cried, ‘Blaspheme not! Thou dost speak Of Christ the King! Wilt thou not worship Him? Oh, look on yonder glittering domes and spires, Those shining temples of a thousand shrines, He built them all!—He made this blessed home For pilgrims, yea, He built it with His blood! Yet in thy folly thou denyest Him!’ So saying, with mine ever-hungry eyes Fix'd on the far-off flame, I hurried on, Moving in haste along the quict knolls. The other follow'd, keeping pace with me. And still the wonder of the City grew, While all my soul in rapture drank it in, Till pausing, dizzy with mine own delight, Panting, with hand held hard upon my heart, I cried aloud, ‘Oh, yea! It is indeed The City of my quest! So great, so fair, I pictured it, a miracle of light. Dost thou not bless the hand that fashion'd thus A haven where all weary souls may rest? Aye, call Him God, or King, or what thou wilt, Dost thou not bless Him for this wondrous work Which in itself betokens Him divine?’ I ceased; but with a sudden wail of pain The other threw his arms into the air, Crying, ‘Though golden in the light of day, And all enwrought it be with earthly gems, Thy sepulchre, O murdered Nazarene, Is still thy sepulchre!’ and, suddenly Turning upon me with a fever'd face, He added, ‘Even as wondrous faery gold, Gather'd in secret by a maiden's hand, Turneth to ashes and to wither'd leaves, So shall that City soon become to thee. Christ's City, sayest thou? Christ's? Christopolis? If that be Christ's I call my curse on Christ Who built it to profane humanity!’ Then shrank I from his side, as one that shrinks From tongues of fire, and, horror in mine eyes, Gazed at that other, greatly wondering; And as I stood, a pilgrim hastening by Cried out, ‘Avoid that man! It is a snake! He speaks for thy perdition!’ Suddenly The stranger's face grew calm, the wind of wrath Pass'd from it, leaving it as sweet and bright As still seas after storm. Upon his heart He press'd his hand, saying, ‘Forgive me, friend, How should my curse avail?’ and, lo! I thought, ‘I will not leave him for a little yet— Perchance my faith (for, ah! my faith is great, Beholding now the very City's walls) May lead him from the dolour of his ways.’ And soon, methought, we twain together moved By secret paths across the open fields To the fair City; and the paths we took Were almost solitary, for the throng Of pilgrims kept the great and dusty road. Green were the fields with grass, and sweet with thyme, And there were silver runlets everywhere O'er which the willow hung her tassell'd locks, And song-birds sang, for it was summer time, And o'er the grass, in green and golden mail, The grasshoppers were leaping, and o'er head A lark, pulsating in the warm still air, Scatter'd sweet song like dewdrops from her wings. And now, albeit we had not turn'd a step, But held our eyes still on the golden Gates, The City seem'd more faint and far away, Lost in the golden tremor of the heat. For as we went, from flowery field to field, I seem'd to hear the stranger's gentle voice Singing unto me in no human tones A sweet song that the soul alone might hear:— O child, where wilt thou rest?— There on the mountain's breast, Where, on a crag of stone The eagle builds her nest? Or in this softer zone, Where sweet, warm winds o' the west Through flowery bowers are blown? O brightest soul and best, Where wilt thou rest? Oh, why make longer flight, Flying from morn till night? Oh, wherefore wander away, When thou wilt find it best To fold thy wings and stay? Child, in mine arms be prest, Soul, do not longer stray; Here, on thy mother's breast, Canst thou not rest? At last we rested under a green tree, Close to the gentle bubbling of a brook Wherein a lamb, with shadow in the pool Wool-white and soft, was drinking quietly— And smiling down, I said, ‘A heavenly place! The very air beyond Christopolis Is sweeten'd with the holy City's breath.’ Then, turning to the stranger, I exclaim'd— ‘Unhappy one! fain would I know thy name, Thy nurture, and thy history more at length. Tell me—perchance I may persuade thee then To pass unto the blessèd Gate with me, And ask forgiveness of its Lord and King. I ceased in wonder; for the other lay Smiling like one in a deep trance, his face Looking to heaven through the tremulous boughs, His eyes grown soft with dew of deepest joy, The light of Nature flowing on his frame Bright and baptismal. ‘Friend,’ the musical voice Answer'd, now thrilling like the skylark's song, ‘The law which made me and the law I keep Absolve me, and my sins are all forgiven. I take them not to market in the town, I put no price upon them, vaunt them not; I bring them hither, under a green tree, And the sun drinks them, and my soul is shriven. Oh, blest were men if to the quiet heart Of their great Mother they crept oftener: Her arms are ever open, her great hope As inexhaustible as the sweet milk With which she feeds innumerable young; And pillow'd here, upon her own bright breast, Safe through all issues I can pity those Who waste their substance in Christopolis.’ Amazed I cried, ‘If I conceive thee right, Wiser is he who lieth in a dream, Idly revolting, drowsy, indolent, Than he who like his fellows fareth on? These fields are sweet—'tis bright and golden weather— But when the cold rain cometh, and the snow, Where wilt thou house?’ Smiling, he answer'd me: ‘Where do the raven and the wood-dove house, And all things through all seasons? He who made Will evermore preserve me. Knowest thou Whose feet trod o'er these fields to make them fair, Whose soft hand hung those boughs with orient gold, Whose finger mark'd the curves of yonder brook, Setting it loose and teaching it to flow Like a thing living, singing on for ever?— The King of Kings!’ ‘Dost thou believe on Him?— Come, then, where He awaits thee, in the walls His chosen have uprear'd.’ ‘I tell thee, friend,’ Answer'd the gentle dreamer darkening, ‘I know that City to the topmost spire, And though a thousand kings keep wassail there He dwelleth not among them. Men uprear'd That City, calling it Christopolis, And marvellously it hath grown and thriven. But, long ere that or any City arose, These and a million greener fields and woods Were fashion'd; how, I know not, but 'twas done; And in the dead of night, miraculously, Before man was, the golden wonder grew. Then Man was made—a bright and naked thing That in the sunshine like an antelope Leapt in the swiftness of his liberty; And as the small birds choose their mates, he chose A creature bright and naked like himself, And in the greenwood boughs they made their nest And rear'd their callow young, singing for joy. This was man's golden age; his race increased, Drank the free sunshine, hunger'd, and were fed, And knew not superstition or disease. With the first building of a human house Against the innocent air and the sweet rain, The age of fire began, which hath indeed Not yet fulfill'd its fierce and fatal course. For on the hearth they kindled cruel flame, And out of flame have sprung by slow degrees, Self-multiplying, self-engendering, The fiery scorpions of unholy arts Innumerable that afflict mankind. And priests at last arose, and out of fire They fashion'd the Creator and Avenger Who with a thousand names pollutes the earth; Who built up yonder City; who usurps The name and privilege of deity; Who slew the Adam in humanity And crucified the Christ: whose thousand spires Shoot yonder up like forks of primal flame Staining the blue sky and the snow-white cloud; Who makes that evil which was fashion'd good, And blurs the crystal of Eternity.’ Then did I think, ‘He raves!’ but gently said, ‘These things thou say'st are hard to understand.’ ‘Tread through the mazes of Christopolis, And thou shalt understand them, marvelling What brought thee hither on so fond a quest;’ And rising, with his eyes in anger fix'd On the great dazzle of the far-off domes, Across the gentle fields he wander'd on. But, following him, I whisper'd in his ear: ‘Much hast thou told me, but thou hast not told That which I ask'd—thy name and history?’ ‘My name is Eglantine,’ the man replied; He added, ‘Brief is my soul's history: A crying out for light that hath not shone, A sowing of sweet seeds that will not spring, A prayer, a tumult, and an ecstasy. But come! I see thy foolish soul is bent Still to fare onward to Christopolis? Come, then, and see, as I have seen, the Tomb Paven with pain and crownèd with a Cross.’ Through fields with orchids sprinkled, under banks Trellis'd with honeysuckle and sweet-briar, By sweetly flowing runlets, now we pass'd, And with mine eager eyes fix'd still like stars Upon the far-off Gate, I noted not That as we went the fields and the green ways Grew wanner and the waving grass less green, Until we came upon that open waste Which lieth all around the mighty City, And through the heart of which the highway winds Up to the western walls. Upon a tract Of lonely stone doth stand Christopolis, And all around for leagues the rocks and sands Stretch bleak and bare; and not a bird thereon Flieth, save kite and crow; and here and there, At intervals, black Crosses point the path, And whitely strewn at every Cross's feet There bleach the bones of pilgrims who have died. But if the waste was bare around about What did I heed, since now at every step I saw the City growing fairer far; The spires and arches all innumerable Flashing their flame at heaven; a million roofs Of gold and silver mirroring the skies; Windows of pearl in sunlight glistening Prismatic; temples and cathedrals blent In one large lustre of delight and dream; And presently there came a solemn sound Of many organs playing, of deep voices Uplifted in a strange celestial hymn, So that the City stirr'd like one great heart In solemn throbs of happiness and praise. BOOK IV. WITHIN CHRISTOPOLIS. Again we trod the highway, midst the crowd, Close to the western walls. At last we stood Close to the very Gate. The Gate was broad For those who rode a-horse or swiftly drave Their golden chariots through, but narrow indeed The pathways were for those who fared a-foot; And on the walls stood priests, from head to heel Enswath'd in scarlet and in gold, and bearing Crosses of silver in their outstretch'd hands; Who cried, ‘Be welcome, ye who enter in!’ But now I shrank afraid, for o'er the Gate A naked Form with piercèd hands and feet, Carven colossal in red agate stone, Hung awful, with a crown upon His head. But soon the surge of strugglers sent us on Along the narrow path and past the priests, Who saw us not, for all their eyes were fix'd Upon a lion-headed Conqueror, Who, with his moaning captives in his tram And bloody warriors round him, enter'd in. But as the stranger in his Eastern raiment Was passing, one cried, ‘Stay!’ and named his name: Another, ‘Scourge him back!’ but Eglantine Sped on, and, running, joined me presently; While all the priests forgot him, welcoming With smiles a lean and senile King who came Barefoot, in sackcloth, with a sickly smile Of false humility. Behind walk'd slaves, Carrying his crown and sceptre. Hast thou stood Within some vast cathedral's organ-loft While the great organ throbs, the stone walls stir, The thunder of the deep ecstatic bass Trembles like earthquake underfoot, the flame Of the bright silvern flutes shoots heavenward, And music like a darkness and a flame Gathers and kindles, wrapping in its cloud The great cathedral to its upmost spire? Ev'n so, but more immeasurably strange, Throbb'd solemn music through Christopolis; And all my soul grew sick with rapturous awe As slowly to the sound I moved along, Amid the shining temples, silver shrines, Solemn cathedrals, shadowy cloister walls, Under the golden roofs, beneath the spires With fiery fingers pointing up at Heaven. Far overhead, from glittering dome to dome, Flew doves, so high in air they seem'd as small As wingèd butterflies, and mid the courts Paven with bright mosaic and with pearl, Walk'd, wrapt in saintly robes of amethyst, Processions of the holy, singing psalms, While smoke of incense swung in censers bright Blew round them, rosy as a sunset cloud. From a great temple's open door there came Wafts of rich perfume, and we enter'd in To music of its own deep organ-heart; And all within was glorious, brightly hung With pictures fairer than a poet's dream: The King as infant in his golden hair, Madonna mother smiling through her tears, With forms and faces most ineffable Of pale dead saints crownèd with aureoles. But as the ruby brightens to the core The temple to its inmost kindled on, And there, around a fiery flashing shrine, Grave priests in white and crimson kindled flame And chaunted, moving slowly to and fro. Over their heads a naked bleeding Christ, Like that above the City's mighty Gate, Hung painted with a wan and wistful smile. From door to door we pass'd, from shrine to shrine, Dazzled with sight and sound; my happy eyes So feeding on each wonder of the way That they perceived not at each temple's porch Black heaps of crouching men and women, clad In rags, who clutch'd me as I enter'd in. At last one held me by the robe, and cried ‘For Christ's sake, stay!’ and turning, I perceived A piteous skeleton that lived and spake; Through his black sockets, like a lamp within, His soul burnt with a faint and feverish fire. ‘What thing art thou?’ I cried. And to my cry No answer came but these despairing words, ‘Bread! Give me bread!’ When, like a house of cards, The wretch sank down again amid his rags, Swooning. Then I perceived that round about Were scatter'd many thousand such as he; Face downward, lying on the paven ways, Crawling like things unclean. Aghast I stood, As if the fiery levin at my feet Had fallen and flamed; and pausing thus I saw Stealing before me to a choral strain A choir of women pale in black array'd; And many look'd upon me vacantly With rayless eyes whence the sweet light had fled; But one white wanton tall and goldenhair'd Laugh'd low and laughing made a sign obscene. I started back as from a blow. ‘Behold!’ Low spake the gentle eremite my guide, ‘Behold the City of Christopolis. Over these streets when they were desert sands The gentle Founder of the City walk'd Barefooted with a beggar's staff and scrip, Saying, “Abandon pride and follow me!” I tell thee, friend, were that pale Paraclete To tread these shining streets this very hour He would not find a spot to rest His head! Above His ashes they have built their pride Higher than Nineveh or Babylon; And mighty craftsmen from a hundred lands Have flock'd to raise these temples for His tomb. Behold it! beautiful, yet still a tomb! For Him, and for a million such as He! Arise, ye dead!’ He stood erect and cried, Waving wild hands above him, and his cry Seem'd answer'd. From the darken'd temple-doors, From secret byways and from sunless lanes, As if uprising from the very earth, Innumerable wretches wrapt in rags, Famish'd for food, and crippled by disease, Crawl'd out into the sun! Like one that sees Legions of spectres round his midnight bed, I stood, appall'd and pale;—around my path They swarm'd like locusts: many knelt and wail'd, Crying for alms; but others cross'd themselves, Smiling; and some, in ghastly merriment, Hooted, and moan'd, or utter'd woeful hymns. ‘It is a festival,’ said Eglantine, ‘That brings these things unclean from out their holes— A Hunt of Kings, with bloody Priests for hounds, Will chase a heretic across the town.’ Even as he spake there gather'd on my sense A sullen murmur as of mighty crowds; And soon, as riseth up the ocean-tide Filling each creek and cavern with its waves, The streets, the open places, and the squares, Were throng'd with living souls. Around my form They wash'd like waters, ever lifting me, Surging me hither and thither eagerly; And on the roofs, and on the belfry-towers, And in the stainèd windows of the shrines, They throng'd—a foam of faces flashing white Above me, hungry for the coming show. But Priests with scourges stood along the road Beating the people back; and Priests on high Rang bells, and sang; and Priests amid the crowd Mingled as thick as blood-red poppies blowing Amid the yellow grain in harvest fields. At last a cry arose, ‘They come! They come!’ Now far away along the mighty street The pageant came: first, fleeter than the pard, The hunted man, not naked like that other Who found the temple of Iconoclast, But like a priest in crimson raimented And on his heaving breast a snow-white Cross— Tall was he, sinewy as a mountain deer, And back behind him blew his reverend hair, And white his face was, set in agony, With eyes that looked behind him fearfully. Swift thro' the throng he pass'd, and all the crowd Shriek'd out in hate, even wretches in their rags Calling a curse upon him. Close behind Lagg'd his pursuers:—first, the panting pack With blood-shot eyes and teeth prepared to tear, So hideous in their lost humanity They seem'd not mortal men but hounds indeed; And after them, with gleaming swords and spears, Gallop'd on foaming steeds the eager Kings, Each King a hideous dwarf with robe and crown, With Queens among them whose large lustful eyes, Hunger'd for blood. Then, as I stood and gazed, I saw a thing so glorious that it seem'd A wondrous rainbow fallen in the street; For in the centre of the company, Upraised supreme beneath a panoply, Sat one so old and dumb at first he seem'd A heathen idol from the banks of Ind— White was his hair as snow, infirm his frame Pillow'd upon a bed of purple dye, And looking on him one might deem him dead, Save for the senile glimmer in the eyes That ever look'd about them vacantly— Around him broke a blood-red surge of Priests Wildly uplifting and upbearing him, And ever chaunting, as they led him on, ‘O holy! holy!’ ‘Whose is yonder shape?’ I questioned; and the gentle voice spake low:— ‘He hath a hundred names;—in ancient times, With mad idolatry, they called him Baal; Usurper and inheritor is he Of him who built the City long ago.’ Past swept the train, that Idol in its midst, The vast crowd like a torrent following,— But suddenly the hunters paused, the tide Of life wash'd back from some dark barrier, And high on air there rose a bitter cry That he they hunted had escaped their wrath. And taken refuge deep in sanctuary. Then forward journeying by slow degrees, We twain, I, Ishmael, and my gentle guide, Came to a mighty square girt round about With towers and temples multitudinous; And at the centre of the square there stood, Close-shut, a brazen Gate encalender'd With awful shapes and legends of the Cross; And baffled at this Gate like angry waves, The Kings, the Queens, and many thousand Priests, Stood clamouring in the sunlight, angrily. ‘What meaneth this?’ I whisper'd—‘Whither now Hath fled the man?’—and Eglantine replied, ‘I did not tell thee what is simple sooth— This gracious City of Christopolis, One as it seemeth, indivisible, A corporal City shining in the sun, Is twain in soul and substance, Cities twain Divided by that brazen Gate thou seest: And citizens who dwell beyond that gate Approve not yonder Idol or his slaves, Nor love so deep the pomp of masonry, Old custom, or the habit of the Priest. Nay, what is holy sooth beyond the gate Within this square may be foul blasphemy! He gain'd the Gate—they open'd:—pray to God That he may there find peace!’ Loudly he spake, In tones of one accustom'd to propound, And many round him listen'd to his words, Whispering among each other. As he ceased There came up panting one of those red hounds Fixing a fever'd eye upon his face, And crying, ‘Have I found thee lingering here?— A snake! A snake!—we thrust him forth before, But here he crawls again!’—and suddenly He thrust his hand out seizing Eglantine, And beckon'd to his comrades clustering round Like hungry wolves that dog the wounded deer. ‘Back!—touch me not!’ he cried, and shook him off. But round him flocking rude and ravenous They cried: ‘To judgment!’—and before he wist They dragged him to that circle of pale Kings Baffled and clamorous for a victim, now The hunted had escaped beyond the Gate; And in the midst sat wan and woe begone That hoary human Idol on its throne, Clad head to foot in crimson and in gold, Yet pitiful, with its poor witless eyes And threads of hoary hair. ‘A snake! a snake!’ All shrieked, upleaping and uplifting him. But calmer, colder than the evening star He shone amongst them, shaking them away. ‘Come to thy Judge!’ they cried—and with a smile He answer'd, ‘Peace!—where is he? I will come Before him willingly!’—A hundred hands Uppointing at the Idol, cried, ‘Behold!’ But folding his thin arms across his breast, And fixing on the senile face a gaze Of utter pity and more piteous scorn: ‘That!—God have mercy on the Judge and judged If that poor worm be mine!’ ‘A heretic!’ Clamoured a thousand throats; those hundred Kings Prick'd up their ears and listen'd eagerly; The red hounds leapt and panted scenting prey— The pale Queens smiled, prepared for cruel sport— While that wan Idol, tottering as he stirr'd, Roll'd hollow eyeballs at the empty air And shook a sceptre in his palsied hands. Then, stepping forward from the crimson ranks, While all the crowd was hush'd to hear him speak, Stood one as gaunt as any skeleton Bearing a sable cross in his right hand; Who, fixing chilly eyes on Eglantine, Thus question'd, ‘Hear'st thou, man!—Dost thou deny Our master's right to judge thee?’ EGLANTINE. I deny That Image, yet denying pity him For his weak age and poor humanity. INQUISITOR. Dost thou deny the heir elect o' the King? Now shall I catch thee tripping, for perchance Thou dost deny the Lord our King Himself? EGLANTINE. Instruct me further, for I know not yet, Since Kings are many, of what King ye speak? INQUISITOR. Of Him who was from all Eternity, Who clothed Himself in likeness of a man, Who died, with His red blood upbuilt the City And sealed it with His name, Christopolis. EGLANTINE. I have not seen Him, and I know Him not; But if a god be judged like man by works, And thy God fashion'd this Christopolis, I do deny Him, and reject Him too, As much as I reject that Spectre there. Rose from the throats of all that multitude A shriek of horror and of cruelty, The red hounds wail'd, the Kings drew out their swords, While I did close mine eyes in agony Fearing to see that gentle brother slain. But still serene as any star his face Smiled and made calm the tempest once again, While with uplifted hand and quivering lips, Pallid with rage, the Inquisitor spake on. INQUISITOR. Now I perceive thee atheist as thou art— Dost thou believe in any King that is? EGLANTINE. I know not. What is he thou callest King? INQUISITOR. The Maker of the heavens and the earth, Dumb monsters and the seeing soul of man: The first strange Force, the first and last Supreme, Shaper of all things, and Artificer. EGLANTINE. Some things are evil—if He fashion'd evil, And leaves it evil, then I know Him not. INQUISITOR. If He made evil (and thou, too, art evil) To be a testimony unto good, Answer me straight—dost thou believe on Him? EGLANTINE. Nay, give me breath, and I will answer thee According to the measure of my seeing. Thou questionest if I believe i' the King? I do believe in Law and Light and Love, If these be He, I do believe in Him; And in mine Elder Brother I believe Because He suffer'd and His voice is sweet, But though He was the fairest of us all, A mortal like myself He lived and died; And when I wander out in yonder fields, Under the opening arch of yonder heaven, Beyond the fatal shadows of these Kings, Beyond the City's dark idolatries, A spirit uplifts my hair, anoints mine eyes, Sweetens my sight, and, if this Spirit be He, With all my heart I do believe in Him; And when in peace I close mine eyes and watch The calm reflection of all shining things Mirror'd within me as within a brook, And feel the scatter'd images of life, Like broken shadows in a pool, unite To lineaments most mystic and divine, I do believe, I verily believe, For God is with me, and the face of God Looks from the secret places of my soul. Thus much I know, and knowing question not; But more than this I cannot comprehend. The Everlasting and Imperishable Eludes me, as the sight of the sweet stars That shine uncomprehended yet serene; For nightly, silently, their eyes unclose, And whoso sees their light, and gazes on it Till wonder turns to rapture, seemeth ever, Like one that reads all secrets in Love's eyes, Swooning upon the verge of certainty— Another look, another flash, it seems And all God's mystery will be reveal'd, But very silently they close again, Shutting their secrét 'neath their silvern lids, And looking inward with a million orbs On the Unfathomable far within Their spheres, as is the soul within the soul. God is their secret;—but I turn to Earth, My Mother, and in her dark fond face I gaze, Still questioning until at last I find Her secret, and its sweetest name is Love: And this one word she murmurs secretly Into the ears of birds and beasts and men; And sometimes, listening to her, as she lies Twining her lilies in her hair, and watching Her blind eyes as they glimmer up to heaven, I dream this word she whispers to herself Is yet another mystic name of God. More would his lips have spoken, but the shriek Of ‘Atheist! Atheist!’ drown'd his gentle voice— And as around some gentle boat at sea Riseth a sudden storm of sharp-tooth'd waves, So rose that company of Priests and Kings; And as a boat is wash'd and whirl'd and driven 'Mid angry breakers, from beyond my sight The dreamer's fair frail form was borne away,— Yet ever and anon I saw his face Arise seraphic 'mid the blood-red sea, Undaunted, undespairing, and as yet Unharm'd! The tumult rose. Kings, Priests, and Slaves, Were mix'd confusedly, as to and fro The great crowd eddied; and I sought in vain To reach the dreamer's side and speak with him; But when I call'd his name despairingly, A hundred hands were lifted on myself, A hundred fingers trembled at my throat, And voices shriek'd, ‘Another—death to him!’ Back was I fiercely driven, step by step, And more than once I stagger'd to my knees, My raiment rent, my body bruised and beaten, My spirit like a lamp swung in a storm Blurr'd, darken'd, shedding only straggling beams Of feeble sense. ‘Almighty King,’ I moan'd, ‘Is this thy City?’ As I spake the words I stagger'd to that mighty brazen Gate, And looking up I saw enwrought thereon These words—‘Knock here if thou wouldst enter in.’ I turn'd once more, and saw the people's faces Flashing in fury round me—swords and staves Uplifted—arms outstretching for my throat: Sick with that sight, I knock'd, and ere I knew The Gate swung open—hands outreaching grasp'd My fainting form and dragg'd me swiftly in;— And as a bark out of an angry sea Ploughs round a promontory into calm, Then slips on silent where all winds are dead Into a quiet haven in the bay, I found myself beyond the brazen Gate, Panting, unharm'd, while from my awestruck ears, Miraculously, instantaneously, The murmur of that tumult died away. BOOK V. WITHIN THE GATE. Breathless, a space I paused, breathless and blind, Then slowly as a wight that wakes from sleep Gazed round me; and behold I found myself Within a great quadrangle dark and still, Uplooking on the other side o' the Gate Whereon was written in a fiery scroll: ‘No path—beware the many-headed Beast!’ And gather'd round me as I shuddering stood I saw a group of silent men in black, Sad-featured, holding each an open book. ‘Where am I now?’ I murmur'd vacantly, One of those strangers with a pensive smile Answer'd, ‘In safety, friend! within this Gate They cannot harm thee. Welcome, weary one, To the blest shelter of Christopolis.’ Whereat I cried: ‘Accursèd be the name, Which lured me from blue heaven and the sweet fields! For he was wise who warn'd me ere I came, And now I know the City as it is, Not holy like the City of my dream, But evil, cruel, dreary, and defiled.’ ‘Blaspheme not,’ said that other; ‘yet in sooth We pardon thee thy rash and ribald speech, For thou hast seen the City's evil side. Beyond that Gate there reigneth Antichrist In likeness of the foul and loathsome Beast, But here, in verity, thy storm-toss'd heart May rest in peace.’ And now, within my dream, Methought I wander'd on with those grave men, And listen'd, hoping, yet in half despair, To their soft speech. Less golden and less bright The City seem'd upon its hither side, For everywhere upon the sunless streets Dark temples and black-arch'd cathedrals cast A solemn shadow, and the light within Was sadder-temper'd and more soul-subduing, And solemner the mighty music seem'd That sigh'd through every crevice like a sea. Yet overhead the same bright fingers shot Their flames at heaven, and the white doves flew, And patient look'd the azure light of heaven Fretted by domes and arches numberless Yet brooding most serene. But now my sou Did scent for evil with a keener sense, And that fair-seeming show of sight and sound O'ercame me not, but ever I look'd abroad In sorrow and mistrust; and soon indeed My search was answer'd; for I saw again, Low-lying near the black cathedral doors, Forms of the wretched writhing in their rags, And peering in through the wide-open doors I saw the shapes of Kings bright-raimented Who knelt at prayer. Then turning unto those Who led me, bitterly I smiled and said: ‘Meseems ye have kept your carrion and your Kings, As they have yonder—Plainly I perceive That still I walk within Christopolis!’ One answer'd: ‘God forbid that we should miss Their company who are divinely crown'd; And for the poor, hath not the King of Kings Enjoin'd upon His servants to have these For ever with them?’ ‘Tell me roundly then, What must he do who would within this Gate Be deem'd a good and lawful citizen? Must he bow down to Idols such as those They carry yonder? Must he quake at Priests? And, if he must be judged, who judgeth him?’ ‘Good man, thou knowest little of this place If thou dost dream that we who dwell herein Will kneel to any Idol or accept The will of perishable Priests or Kings. Upon that score we parted first with those Our neighbours, choosing here to dwell apart. Be one of us, and surely thou shalt bow Neither to Idol nor to mortal man, Nor shalt thou quake at any mortal judge; Nay, shouldst thou need a judge that judge shall be Thine own good conscience and the City's law.’ Then did I brighten, somewhat comforted, Yet nothing now could waken in my soul That old first faith wherewith I saw from far The flashing of the City's thousand spires— And to myself I said: ‘A bootless dream, A dreary City and a bootless dream, If this be all!’ So with a heavy heart I look'd upon the temples and the shrines, And heard the solemn music welling forth, And saw the quiet folk that came and went, Silent and quick, like bees that throng i' the hive. Now, as I wander'd musing, I beheld One who sat singing at a temple door, His face illumined, turning soft with tears Upward and sunward; and the song he sang Was low and hush'd as is the nightingale's Just as the dusky curtain of a cloud Is drawn across the bright brow of the moon; And, lo! I listen'd, for it seem'd the song Came from the deep heart of mine own despair, And tears were in mine eyes before it ceased. Come again, come back to me, White-wing'd throng of childish Hours, Lead me on from lea to lea, Ankle-deep in meadow flowers; Set a lily in my hand, Weave wild pansies in my hair, Through a green and golden land Lead me on with fancies fair. White-wing'd Spirits, come again,— Heal my pain! Through the shadows of the rain Come again! Come again, and by me sit As you sat that summer day, Seeing through the mists of heat This great City far awav. Golden glow'd its magic fires Far across the valleys green, Heavenward flash'd its thousand spires, Silent, trembling, faintly seen. Show thy visions once again, White-wing'd train! With the dream I dream'd in vain, Come again! Come again, and lead me back To the fields and meadows sweet, Softly, by the self-same track Follow'd by my coming feet; From the City's gates set free, Backward to the gates of morn— Every backward step will be Brighter, fairer, less forlorn. Lead me! let me reach again Wood and lane— Lead me to your green domain Once again. Come again!—but, O sweet Hours! If ye come not ere I die, Find me dead, with bands of flowers Lift me up from where I lie, Take me to the woodland place Where I linger'd long ago, Set soft kisses on my face, Singing, as ye lay me low— Let me slumber there again, Far from pain— Waking up with weary brain, Ne'er again! Methought that as that song of sad despair Rose like a murmuring fountain, all the place Darken'd as when the sun is lost in clouds; And from the temples, from the clustering dwellings, There rose in answer one great wail of pain, Which breaking like a wave was spent in tears; And, lo! mine own tears fell, for I remember'd The meadows where I wander'd when a child, The baptism of my love new born in joy And looking on a sun-illumined world. Then one of those grave dwellers in the City, Turning upon me dark and ominous eyes, Said, ‘'Tis the music which the Snake did weave To mock the first of man when he had fallen— Self-pity is the mournful slave of sin; Do thou beware in time!’ whereon I cried, ‘A light is lost that never will return: What canst thou give me now to heal the heart Made desolate as dust?’ ‘Pray!’ ‘I have pray'd!’ ‘Wait!’ ‘I have waited!’ ‘If thy spirit fail, Turn to the living wonder of the Word!’ Then I perceived that he with whom I spake Held in his hand an open Book like that I bare within my breast; and gazing round I saw that every shape within those streets Did hold a Book wide open as he walk'd, Reading aloud and muttering to himself Prayer, parable, and psalm. Wherefore I cried, ‘I know that comfort; it was given for bread, But turn'd to bitterest wormwood long ago!’ Then ere I knew it I was circled round With faces terrible and white as death, And one, a hoary wight with eyes of fire, Shriek'd, ‘Strike him down, O thunderbolt of God! He doth deny Thine everlasting Word!’ But one, more gentle, interposing, said: ‘Silence, and list unto him. Pilgrim, speak; Dost thou deny God's message unto men?’ THE PILGRIM. Nay, I deny it not, but I have heard That message, and I find no comfort there. STRANGER. No comfort in the justice of the Lord? No succour in the mercy of the Son? THE PILGRIM. Sad is that justice, woeful is the mercy, Most dark the testimony of the Book But yonder, out beyond the City's wall, The sun shines golden, and the earth is merry, And only here the grievous shadow lies. STRANGER. The shadow of thy sin, which sin is death. Answer again: Believest thou the Book? THE PILGRIM. As I believe in thunders and in storm. STRANGER. Dost thou reject all other testimonies, Holding this only as the voice of God? THE PILGRIM. Nay, for I hear it as the voice of men. STRANGER. Dost thou believe these wonders written down? THE PILGRIM. Nay, for among them many are most sad, Some are incredible, and all most strange. STRANGER. Rejectest thou the Book's own testimony, That all these mysteries are truths divine? THE PILGRIM. No book can testify unto itself; Nor is that Book a living voice at all! STRANGER. These tokens testify to Word and Book: The lights of Heaven and Hell; the voice of God Heard in the beating of the human heart; Christ's burial; last, His rising from the grave. Denyest thou these? THE PILGRIM. Heaven have I fail'd to find; Hell have I found on earth, and in thy City; The voice of mine own soul rejects the voice I once did hear in my affrighted heart; I do believe Christ's burial, but, alas! Why is the gentle promise unfulfill'd? Why doth the world's pale Martyr rest unrisen? STRANGER. In spirit He hath risen—lo, His City, To testify His prescience and His power. Ev'n as he spake, there pass'd along the street A host of armèd men in black array'd, Led on by one who rode a sable steed And wore a helmet shapen like a crown; These to Jehovah as they march'd did raise A sullen hymn of praise for victory, And some were to the ankles shod in blood, But many as they march'd did gravely read The open pages of the Holy Book. ‘What men are these?’ I adk'd, and one replied: ‘Warriors of Christ, who walk about the world Slaying and smiting in the blessèd Name!’ Then, laughing low in bitterness of heart, I saw the doors and casements opening wide, And faces thronging with a wicked joy To welcome back the warriors of the Lord. Moreover, as I gazed, mine eyes could mark Dark chambers full of grave and silent men Who sat at ebon tables counting gold, And 'mid the golden heaps that each did pile The open Scripture lay; and down the streets Came men who waved their hands, and cried, ‘Repent!’ And here and there, in lonely darken'd places, The Tree of man's invention rose and swung With human fruitage dead and horrible; And 'neath that Tree more woeful voices rose, Crying, ‘Repent and die! Repent and die!’ And million voices echoed back the sound, And even those silent men who counted gold Moan'd answer from the darkness of their dens. Then cried I, ‘He was wise who warn'd me, saying, “Thy sepulchre, O bleeding Nazarene, Is still thy sepulchre!” Thy dream was peace, But lo, destruction, sorrow, and a sword; Thy prayer was for the poor and meek of heart, But lo, the golden gloom and dust of pride; Thy oreed was mercy for the worst and best, But lo! the hideous Tree and not the Cross; Thy light was sunshine and a shining place, But lo! deep dread and darkness of the Book;’ And turning to those men who follow'd me, ‘The black leaves of the Book are blossomless, And of its upas-fruit whoever eats Bears wormwood in his heart for evermore.’ ‘Blasphemer!’ answer'd one in night-black robes, And hollow-eyed as Famine throned on graves; ‘The Gospel which is wormwood in the mouth Is honey being eaten and consumed. Evil are mortals, evil is the world, Evil are all things man hath written down; But this one thing is absolutely good: Read it, and live; cast it away, and die.’ THE PILGRIM. I'll read no more;—fairer to me by far That Book I read, not understanding yet, Upon the lonely shores where I was born. CITIZEN. What Book is that? and written by whose hand? THE PILGRIM. By God's in the beginning; on its front He set the stars for signs, the sun for seal; Golden the letters, bright the shining pages, Holy the natural gospel, of the earth; Blessèd tenfold the language of that Book For ever open; blessèd he who reads The leaf that ever blossoms ever turn'd! CITIZEN. This Book I hold doth prove that other dust; Its brightness is a fleshly sin and snare. THE PILGRIM. He made it; left it open for our seeing. CITIZEN. The shadow of the primal sin remains. There, on the fallen rose-leaves of the world, The snake crawls, as in Eden long ago. Upon me, as he spake, methought there fell A shadow like that shadow which he fear'd; And in its midst, as in some night of storm The crested billows flash with gleams of foam, The faces of those sombre citizens Glimmer'd around. Mad with mine own despair I stood as on some dreary promontory Looking on tempest of a sunless sea— ‘Behold the Book!’ I cried, while from my breast I drew it forth and held it high in air; ‘Here in mine bosom it hath lain for long, Chiller than ice and heavy as a stone; I cast it back as bread upon the waters— Uplift it, wear it on his heart who will, Henceforward I reject it utterly.’ So saying I threw it from me, while a shriek Of horror rose from that black crowd of men; And ere I knew it I was circled round With living waters rising high in wrath To drown and to devour and dash me down. ‘Death to him! to the foul blasphemer, death!’ ‘Wrath to the wretch who doth reject the Word!’ ‘Ah, Satan, Satan!’ rose the murderous cries, While all in vain I sought to shield my head Against a shower of ever-increasing blows; And, lo! again, I saw the doors and casements Were open, and wild faces looking forth, And warriors pointed at me with their swords, And women rushing with dishevell'd hair Shriek'd ‘Vengeance!’ till meseem'd before my feet The very pit of Hell was yawning wide, While flame flash'd up, and smoke of fire arose, Scorching my sense and blotting from my sight The towers and temples of Christopolis. But as I struggled crying out on God, Methought that one in raiment white and fair Strode to me through the horror of the crowd And held me up from falling, while the cry Grew louder, ‘Cast him out beyond the Gate! Slay him, and cast him forth!’ and as a straw Is lifted on a torrent, I was raised, And wildly, darkly, desolately driven I knew not whither. From the earth still rose Darkness and fire; fire from the heavens o'erhead Seem'd following: baleful fire did wrap me round As with red raiment—but that succouring hand Still held me, and a low voice in mine ear Cried, ‘Courage,’ as I drifted dumbly on. From street to street, from lane to lane methought They drove me, bruised and bleeding, till I reach'd Another Gate, which on its hinges swinging Open'd to let me pass, then with a clang Did shut its soot-black jaws behind my back, While from within I heard the sullen roar Of those dark waters which had cast me forth. BOOK VI. THE CALVARIES. At last methought I paused, and deathly pale, My raiment rent, my body bruised with blows, Turn'd to my rescuer with questioning eyes And would have spoken, but the other cried, ‘Hush for a space, lest thou be overheard!’ And not until our feet had flown full far, Down empty byways and down darken'd lanes, Nor till the populous walks were far behind And we were deep in flowers and meadow-grass Of quiet uplands, did we pause again. And now the star of evening had arisen Set like a sapphire in the shadowy west, And slow crows waver'd homeward silently With sleepy waft of wing, and all was still, Only the far-off murmur of the City Came like the distant thunder of a sea. Then pausing, I upon my gentle guide Gazed closely, and beheld a face benign, Sweeten'd with many sorrows, sweetest eyes Weary and weak with their own gentleness, And lips sweet too, yet close together set With sad resolve. Tall was the stranger's height, His gestures noble, but his shoulders stoop'd With some dark burthen not beheld of eyes; And ever in his breast did creep his hand, As if to still the tumult of his heart. Yet, gazing on his garb, I shrank away Sick and afraid, for lo! upon his breast Glimmer'd the crimson Cross of those fierce Priests, And clad he was like many in the City In a white robe that swept unto his feet. Darkly I cried, ‘Avaunt! I know thee not! I deem'd thee good, but thou art even as those Who stoned me, thronging at my throat like wolves, And sought my life;’ when with a smile as bright As had the vesper star above his head, ‘Friend, be at peace!’ the gentle stranger cried, ‘Nor fear mine office, by the Cross I wear!’ THE PILGRIM. That Cross affrights my vision—pluck it off, And I shall know thou art a man indeed. STRANGER. I cannot, since I am God's Priest elect; Nay, rather in the Name of Him who bare A cross like this I bid thee love the sign. THE PILGRIM. Carry thy firebrand back into the City, I loathe it! Evil is the sign, and still Evil its wearers wheresoe'er they walk! Art thou a Priest? My curse upon thy head! Avoid me!—to thy brethren—get thee gone! STRANGER. Until thy heart is calm'd I cannot go; Nor will I leave thee till thou hearest me. THE PILGRIM. Thou heardst me—I proclaim'd it in the City— False are your fables, false your boasted creeds, Falsest of all your spirits and your lives. There is no truth in any land at all Ye darken, sitting by the side of Kings. STRANGER. False Priests are false, and these thine eyes have seen. THE PILGRIM. All Priests are false, for falsehood is their creed, STRANGER. Phrase me my creed; if thou canst prove it false I promise thee I will abandon it. THE PILGRIM. How shall I name it? Which of many names Shall fit it now? Guile, Fraud, Hypocrisy, Blood-thirst and Blood-shed, Persecution, Pride, Mammon—in one word sum it, Vanity. STRANGER. Friend, thou hast miss'd the mark. Our creed is Love. THE PILGRIM. I know that jargon. Spare it; for I know it. The wolf wears wool, and calls himself a lamb. STRANGER. Heed not our garb, or what we call ourselves— Yea, judge not what we seem, but what we are. THE PILGRIM. That have I done; so is my judgment proved; For they who flaunt your banners in Love's name Pursued me, stoned me on from street to street, And would have slain me with their bloody hands. STRANGER. In sooth they would, had help not intervened. I know them well; my friend, they have stoned me! THE PILGRIM. They do not spare each other, I believe; But even as wolves, when no poor sheep is near, They fall upon each other and devour. STRANGER. Bitter thou art, o'er bitter, yet thy words, Though harsh as wormwood, are in measure just, For many Priests are false, and follow ill The Scripture they propound to foolish flocks. Yet mark me well; though many sought by force To win the soul they could not win by words, 'Twas for thy soul they wrought, to save thy soul, And insomuch, though blind, they wrought in love. THE PILGRIM. Smiling and slaying! hungry for my life! O Sophist! now I know thee Priest indeed. STRANGER. Pause yet. I love their deeds no more than thou, Yet rather would believe them doubly blind (For blindness may be crime, but is not sin) Than wholly base and hypocritical. Grant that they sought thy death—through death they sought To win thy spirit to eternal life! Thou laughest, and mad mockery in thine eyes Burneth with bloodshot beams. Resolve me now— Dost thou deny that these same Priests are blind? THE PILGRIM. To good, I grant thee, but for this world's goods Who have a sense so keen? and wheresoe'er Hath crawl'd this glittering serpent of a Church All men may know it by these tokens twain— Blood-marks, and next, its slimy trail of gold. Blind are ye to the sun and moon and stars, To good, and to the beggar at your gates; But unto usury ye are not blind; And into murderous eyes of Queens and Kings Your eyes can look approval, while your mouths Intone fond hymns to tyranny and war; And unto raiment rich, and glittering coins, And houses hung with crimson and with gold, And harlots beckoning in their golden hair, Methinks all mortals know ye are not blind! Thus spake I in the tempest of my heart, Now pacing up and down with fever'd steps The twilight-shadow'd lanes beyond the City; And now the eyes of heaven were opening, And in dark woods hard by the nightingales Sang softly up the slow and lingering moon. And, hurrying my footsteps, soon I came To where four roads did meet to make a cross, And in the centre of the way I saw, Dim, livid, silhouetted on the sky, A Calvary, and thereupon a Christ Most rudely sculptured out of crimson stone. Thereon, methought, I halted shuddering, Gazed, then shrank back, and covered up mine eyes, When once again I noted at my side That white-robed stranger and upon mine ear Again the melancholy accents fell. STRANGER. Why shrinkest thou? Kneel down and ease thy heart. THE PILGRIM. Peace, peace! I will not worship wood or stone. Who set that image here to block the way? Nay, spare thine answer; they who wrought this thing Are those who stoned me from Christopolis— Thy brethren! Not the honeysuckled lanes, The twilight-shadow'd meadows sweet with flowers, The violet-sprinkled ways and underwoods, Not Nature's self, not the still solitude, Are free from this pollution dark as death, This common horror of idolatry. STRANGER. Knowest thou whose shape is carven on that cross? THE PILGRIM. The Man Divine whom Priests of Judah slew. STRANGER. The Man Divine who still is hourly slain Wherever sin is thought or wrong is done. O brother, keep me by thy side a space, And, looking on that symbol, hark to me. Him did they stone, like thee and me; and yet— Mark this, He loved them, dying for their sake. Blame them, if they are worthy of thy blame, Lament them, in so far as they have fallen From the divine ideal they propound; But still remember this, amidst thy blame— They rear'd that Cross and set that symbol there! THE PILGRIM. To what avail? To darken earth's sweet ways? STRANGER. To hold forth hope to every living man, To be a protestation and a power Against their own defilement if defiled. 'Tis something to uprear a mighty truth, Though from its eminence the weak will falls; 'Tis much to plant a beacon on the sea, Though they who plant it lose their hold and drown. Were each priest evil in an evil world, This would not prove that fair ideal false Which for the common gaze they find and prove. Brother, hadst thou but watch'd this place with me By night-time, in the silence of the night! For out of yonder City, as if ashamed, Sad human creatures creep with hooded heads And falling at the feet of Calvary, Scarce conscious of each other's presence, weep Such tears as yonder Christ deems worth a world. And moonlight falling on their haggard faces Hath shown the lineaments of cruel Kings Set side by side with beggars in their rags, And pale Queens, naked, crownless, grovelling close To harlots with dishevell'd locks of gold, And conscience-stricken Priests that beat their breasts With bitterest ululations of despair. Then did I smile, and cry, ‘I doubt thee not! What then? Next dawn thy Kings were on their thrones, Thy Queens were crown'd, thy harlots plied their trade, Thy beggars craved for bread and gnaw'd a stone, Thy Priests were glorious in their gold and gems, And all the City busy as before. Such conscience is an owl that flies by night, No sweet white dove that moves abroad by day; And he who in the sunlight brazens best Is the worst coward in night's creeping time.’ I added this, moreover, ‘Since so far Thy feet have follow'd, and since, furthermore, I owe thee something for my weary life, I will accost thee in a gentler mood, Seeking thy soul's conversion even as thou Hast sought for mine; but first I fain would know Thy name, thine office, and thy quality.’ Whereon the other smiling, better pleased, ‘My name is Merciful, the Priest of Christ, And yonder in Christopolis I dwell Half hated by my brethren and half fear'd, Because I help the Pilgrims passing by And lead them hither unto Calvary.’ THE PILGRIM. Art thou not shamed to wear the garb they wear, Seeing their deeds profane it terribly? MERCIFUL. Not so. If they fulfil their office ill, That doth not prove the office evil too: And wearing this white dress of sanctity I work as one that hath authority, And better help poor Pilgrims passing by. THE PILGRIM. Thus far, thou workest good. Now, answer me— Dost thou believe the fables of the Book? MERCIFUL. Not in the letter, but essentially. THE PILGRIM. Dost thou believe that still by one man's fall We mortal men are lost and overthrown; But yet, since God did make Himself a Man, Attesting this by many miracles, Through God's own Death the world may still be saved? MERCIFUL. I do believe these things symbolically, As I believe the symbol of that Cross. THE PILGRIM. Did Jesus live and die in Galilee? Did he work miracles and raise the dead? Was Jesus God, and could God Jesus die? MERCIFUL. I will not fall into that trap of words, Which, grimly smiling, thou hast laid for me, But I will answer thee as best I may, Clearly, and with no touch of sophistry. ‘Did Jesus live?’ I know a sweet Word lives, Coming like benediction on the sense Where'er Love walks uplooking heavenward, And since no Word is spoken without lips, Hearing that Word I know He lived and breathed. ‘Did Jesus die?’ On every wayside cross, In every market-place and solitude, I see a symbol of a wondrous death; And, since each symbol doth its substance prove, How should I not believe that Jesus died? ‘Did he work miracles and raise the dead?’ ‘Was Jesus God?’—Here is my timid sense Lost in a silence and a mystery— And yet I know, by every breath I breathe, The Mighty and the Merciful are one: The morning dew that scarcely bends the flowers Inhaled to heaven becomes the lightning flash That lights all heaven ere noon. ‘Could Jesus die?’ If Death be Life, and Life Eternity, If Death be but the image of a change, Perchance even God might take the image on, And in the splendour of His pity, die. So spake the gentle Priest, his mild blue eye Dewy with love for all men and for God, But I did answer with a hollow laugh Deep as a raven's croak, that echoed on Through all the architraves of that blue vault Above us bent. ‘God help thee, man!’ I cried; ‘For thou art pleased as any yearling babe With playthings that thou canst not understand. Fables and symbols dazzle thy twain eyes, And phantasies of loving sentiment Puzzle thy reason and perplex thy will. Wiser are they who on the tripod sit, Intoning oracles and studying The dry dull letter of theology, Than they who, like to thee and such as thou, Are drunken with its gentle images.’ ‘Kneel!’ answer'd Merciful; ‘perchance in prayer Thine eyes may be unveil'd.’ But I replied, Pointing at that pale Calvary which loom'd Dim and gigantic in the starry light, ‘I will not kneel to yonder shape of stone, If by the name of God thou callest it; But if thou call'st it Man, Man crucified, Man martyr'd, I will kneel, not worshipping, But clinging to an Elder Brother's feet, And calling on the sweetest saddest soul That ever walk'd with bleeding limbs of clay The solitary shades beneath the stars. He found it not, the City that I seek, He came and went upon His quest in vain, And crucified upon His path by Priests Became a portent and a piteous sign On the great high way of man's pilgrimage; And though the memory of His love is sweet, The shadow of Him is cruel and full fraught With tearfullest despairs; and wheresoe'er We wander, we are haunted out of hope By this pale Martyr with His heavenly eyes, Born brightest and loved least of all the sons Of God the Father! Could I 'scape the sight Methinks that I could fare along in peace!’ ‘Never,’ cried Merciful, ‘where'er thou fliest, Wilt thou escape it! Search where'er thou wilt, Follow what path thou choosest, soon or late With that red Cross thou wilt come face to face When least thou dreamest. On the desert sands, On the sad shores of the sea, upon the scroll Of the star-printed heavens, on every flower That blossoms, on each thing that flies or creeps 'Tis made—the sign is made, the Cross is made— That cipher which whoever reads can read The riddle of the worlds.’ So saying, he fell Low kneeling at the foot of Calvary, And praying aloud; and overhead indeed The awful sacrificial lineaments Seem'd soften'd in the moonlight, looking down As if they smiled. Darkly I turn'd away Heartsick, first wafting to that sculptured form One look of love and pity. Silently, In meditation deep as my despair, I follow'd the dark road I knew not whither, As desolate as Io wandering; And like another Argus following, Blue heaven with all its myriad eyes on mine Brooded; and wayside scents of honeysuckle Came to my nostrils from the darken'd fields, And glowworms glimmer'd through the dewy grass, And all was sweet and still; but evermore, At intervals, on either side I saw New Calvaries upon the lonely road And sculptured Christs outstretching stony arms. BOOK VII. THE WAYSIDE INN. Now as I walk'd I mused . . . ‘The Priest spake well: The Cross is everywhere, and read aright Is Nature's riddle; well, I read it thus— Silent progressions to new powers of pain Through cruel æons of blood-sacrifice. For life is based upon the law of death, And death is surely evil; wherefore, then, All life seems evil. To each thing that lives Is given, without a choice, this destiny— To be a slayer or a sufferer, A tyrant or a martyr; to be weak Or cruel; to range Nature like a hawk, Or fall in cruel talons like a dove; And of these twain, where both are evil things, That Cross decrees that martyrdom is best. What then? Shall I praise God for martyrdom? Nay!—I can drink the poison cup and die, But bitter is the blessing I would call On Him who mix'd it with His fatal Hand.’ The path I follow'd now was dark as death, And overhead the ever-gathering clouds Were charged with rain; the piteous stars were gone, Blown out like tapers in a mighty wind That wheel'd in maddening circles round the moon; And deeper into the dark vaporous void The moon did burn her way till she was hid And nothing but the cloudy night remain'd. Then the great wind descended, and, it seem'd, In answer to it every wayside Christ Stretch'd arms and shriek'd. Suddenly, with a groan, The vials of the storm were open'd! Then The rain fell, and the waters of the rain Stream'd like a torrent; and across the shafts Sheet-lightning glimmer'd ghastly, while afar The storm-vex'd breakers of Eternity Thunder'd. In that great darkness of the storm Wildly I fled, and, lo! my pilgrim's robes, Drench'd with the raindrops, like damp cerements clung Around my weary limbs; and whither I went I knew not, but as one within a maze Drave hither and thither, with my lifted arms Shielding my face against the stinging lash Of rains and winds. Methought my hour was come, For oft upon the soaking earth I fell, Moaning aloud; yet ever again I rose And struggled on; even so amid a sea Of dark and dreadful waters strikes and strives Some swimmer, half unconscious that he swims, Yet with the dim brute habit of the sense Fighting for life he knows not why or how Nor whither on the mighty billows' breast His form is roll'd! But ever and anon When, like a lanthorn dim and rain-beaten That flasheth sometimes to a feeble flame, My dark mind into memory was illumed, I thought, ‘Despair! I cannot last the night! Ah, would that I had stay'd with that pale Priest, Seeking for comfort where he findeth it. Yea, better his half-hearted company Than to be drifting in the tempest here, Alone, despairing, haunted, woe-begone. He cannot hear me. Shall I call on Christ, His Master?—Christ! Adonai!—He is dumb, Dumb in His silent sculptured agony— Dead! dead!’ I would have fallen with a shriek, But suddenly across my aching eyes There shot a bloodshot light as of some fire Amid the waste. I stood, and strain'd my gaze Into the darkness. Steady as a star The glimmer grew, shining from far away With slant moist beams on the black walls of rain. Lured by the lonely ray I struggled on, Faint, stumbling, soaking, panting, overpower'd, But brighter as I went the glimmer grew, And soon I saw it from the casement came Of a dark dwelling on the weary waste. Forlorn the dwelling stood, and on its roof The rain smote with a cheerless leaden sound, And in the front of it, on creaking chains, There swung a sign. Then did my beart upleap, Rejoicing once again in hope to feel The touch of human hands, to hear the sound Of human voices; and I cried aloud, ‘Thank God at least for this lone hostelry, But for its friendly help I should have died.’ So saying, I knock'd, and as I knock'd I heard, Faint, far within, a sound of revelry From distant rooms; but still the cruel rain Smote on me, and above my head the sign Moan'd like a corse in chains. I knock'd again More clamorously, striking with my staff— And soon I heard the shuffling of slow feet Approaching. Hearing this, I knock'd the more, And then, with creak and groan of locks and keys, The door swung open, and before mine eyes Loom'd a great lobby in the midst of which A marble-featured serving-maiden stood, Sleepy, half yawning, holding in her hand A dismal light. Bloodless her cheeks and cold, Her hair a golden white, her eyes dead blue, Her stature tall, and thin her shrunken limbs And chilly hands. ‘Welcome!’ she murmur'd low, Not marking me she welcomed but with eyes All vacant staring out into the night. ‘Who keeps this house?’ I question'd, rushing in, And as she closed and lock'd the oaken door The maiden answer'd with a far-off look, Like one that speaks with ghosts, ‘My master, sir, Host Moth; and we are full of company This night, and all the seasons of the year.’ Even then, along the lobby shuffling came The lean and faded keeper of the inn, A wight not old, but rheumatic and lame, With wrinkled parchment skin, and jetblack eyes Full of shrewd greed and knowledge of the world; And in a voice of harsh and sombre cheer He croak'd ‘Despair, show in the gentleman— Methinks another Pilgrim from the City? Thy servant, sir! Alack, how wet thou art!— No night for man or beast to be abroad. Ho there! more faggots in the supperroom, The gentleman is cold; but charily, wench, No waste, no waste, for firewood groweth dear, And these be pinching times.’ So saying, he rubb'd His feeble hands together, chuckling low A sordid welcome, while a shudder ran, Half pain, half pity, through my chilly veins, To see the lean old body clad in rags— A dreary host, methought; and as I thought, I glanced around me on the great dark walls All hung with worm-eat tapestry that stirr'd In the chill airs that crept about the house; For through great crannies in the old inn's walls Came wind and wet, and oftentimes the place Shook with the blast. ‘How callest thou thine inn?’ I ask'd, still shaking off the clammy rain And stamping on the chilly paven floor— ‘Methinks 'tis very ancient?’ ‘Yea, indeed,’ Answer'd that lean and grim anatomy; ‘None older in the land—an ancient house, Good sir, from immemorial time an inn. Thou sawest the sign—a skull enwrought with roses, And wrought into a wine-cup ruby rimm'd? My father's father's father set it there.’ THE PILGRIM. Thou seemest full of guests. Thine inn must thrive. HOST. Thrive? yea, with thrift! We lie too far away, Too lone i' the waste, for many travellers; And they who come, good lack, are mostly poor, Penniless men with burthens on their backs And little in their pouches, save us all! Once on a time, in my good grandsire's day, The house throve well, and at that very door King Cruel and full many a mighty man Lighted, a-hunting here upon the waste. But now the house decays. Alack, alack! Sometimes methinks 'twill fall about mine ears. What then? I have no kin to leave it to, And if it lasts my little lapse of time Why, I shall be content! Thus murmur'd he, Ushering into a mighty bed-chamber His shivering guest; and on the hearth thereof The marble maid strew'd firewood down and sought To light a fire, but all the wood was wet, And with her cold thin lips she blew the flame To make it glow, while mine host chatter'd on. ‘This, master, is the only empty room— Kept mostly for great guests, but since the house Is full, 'tis thine. Upon that very bed King Cruel himself hath slept, and good Priest Guile Before they made him Pope. I'll leave thee, sir. When thou art ready thou shalt sup below In pleasant company.’ Then methought within That antique room I stood alone and dried My raiment at the faint and flickering fire; And in the chill blue candlelight the room Loom'd with vast shadows of the lonely bed, The heavy hangings, and dim tapestries; And there were painted pictures on the walls, Old portraits, faint and scarce distinguishable With very age—of monarchs in their crowns, Imperial victors filleted with bay, And pallid queens. ‘A melancholy place,’ I murmur'd; ‘yet 'tis better than the storm That wails without!’ Down through that house forlorn I wended, till I reach'd a festal room, Oak-panel'd, lighted with a pleasant fire, And therewithin a supper-table spread With bakemeats cold, chill cates, and weak wan wines. There, waited on by that pale handmaiden, I supp'd amid a silent company Of travellers, for no man spake a word. But when the board was clear'd and drinks were served, Around the faggot fire all drew their seats; And stealing in, a tankard in his hand, The host made one, and fondled his thin knees. And now I had leisure calmly to survey My still companions looming like to ghosts In the red firelight of the lonely inn. They seem'd of every clime beneath the sun, And clad in every garb, but all, it seem'd, Were melancholy men, and some in sooth Were less than shadows, houseless and forlorn; And in the eyes of most was dim desire And dumb despair; and upon one another They scarcely gazed, but in the dreary fire Look'd seeking faces. For a time their hearts, In the dim silence of that dreary room, Tick'd audibly, like a company of clocks, But soon the host upspake, and sought to spread A feeble cheer. ‘Come, gentlemen, be merry More faggots—strew them on the hearth, Despair! All here are friends and Pilgrims; let's be merry!’ And turning round to one who by his dress And grizzled beard did seem a travelling Jew, He added, ‘Master Isaac, thou art dull! What cheer i' the town to-day? How thriveth trade?’ ‘Ill, master,’ answer'd, with his heavy eyes Still on the fire, the Jew itinerant: ‘The accursed of Canaan in the temples reign, And he who by the God of Judah swears Hath little thrift. I saw a merry sight: Another Pilgrim stoned for following The dream their Master, the dead Nazarene, Preach'd for a sign. Could he not hold his peace, And smile, as I do, spitting o'er my head In secret, for a curse upon the place?’ Even as he spake I started, listening, As if I heard the sound of mine own name, But ere my lips could speak, another voice Came from the circle, shrill and petulant: ‘I saw the sight, and laugh'd with aching sides. They would have let an atheist pass in peace, But him they stoned. Poor fool! he went in rags, Seeking the moonshine City those same priests Preach, laughing in their sleeves.’ A dreary laugh Ran through the circle as he spoke, but none Lifted his vacant vision from the fire. Then I, now glancing at the speaker's face, Cold, calm, and bitter, lighted with a sneer, Answer'd— ‘I am that man of whom you speak— What moves thy mirth?’ ‘Thy folly,’ grimly said The other; and the circle laugh'd again. But with a cunning and insidious smile The Jew cried, interposing, ‘Softly, friends! Be civil to the gentleman, who is A rebel like yourselves, hating as much Those cruel scarecrows of authority.’ Then, turning with a crafty look to me, He added quietly—‘Thy pardon, sir! A Pilgrim unto Dreamland, I perceive?’ Whereat I answer'd, frowning sullenly— ‘Nay, to the tomb! And as I live, meseems, In this lone hostel's black sarcophagus, I reach my journey's end, and stand amid My fellow corpses!’ As I spake the word, There started up out of that company A youth with wild large eyes and hair like straw, Lean as some creature from the sepulchre, The firelight flashing on his hueless cheeks, Waving his arms above his head, and crying, ‘A tomb! it is a tomb, and we the dust Cast down within it—dead! for on our orbs Falleth no sunlight and no gentle dew, Nor any baptism shed by Christ or God, The Phantoms that we follow'd once in quest! To-day is as to-morrow, and we reck No touch of Time, but moulder, coffin'd close, Far from the wholesome stars!’—and as the maid Pass'd coldly, on her ghastly face he fix'd His wild, lack-lustre eye: ‘Fill, fill, sweet wench; Let the ghosts sit upon their graves and drink; And come thou close and sit upon my knee, That I may kiss thy clammy lips and smooth Thy chilly golden hair!’ He sank again, Fixing his eyes anew upon the fire, Whilst the Jew whisper'd softly in mine ears: ‘'Tis Master Deadheart, the mad poet, sir; Heed not his raving! Once upon a time He was a Pilgrim like thyself, but now He dwelleth in the middle of the waste, Within a dismal castle, ivy-hung And haunted by the owls.’ But I replied, ‘There's method in his madness. Unto him God is not, therefore he is surely dead, And as he saith, a corpse, for God is Life.’ Then spake again he who had laugh'd before At my dark plight, between his firm-set teeth Hissing the words and smiling: ‘Who is this That prates of God? Another Phantom-hunter! Another Pilgrim after the All Good, Who sees not all is evil, even the goad Of selfish hope that pricks him feebly on?’ The tone was gentler than the words, and spake Pity supreme and sorrow infinite, Wherefore not angrily did I reply: ‘I love to know their names with whom I speak, First tell me thine, and I may answer thee?’ ‘Why not!’ replied the other quietly; ‘Our host doth know my name as that of one That plainly saith his say and pays his score. My name is Wormwood, and hard by this place I keep a school for Pilgrims not too old To learn of me!’ THE PILGRIM. Come, school me if thou wilt! Thou sayest that all is evil—prove thy saying. WORMWOOD. Why should I prove what thine own simple heart Is chiming? Prove the sound of funeral bells, The trump of wars, the moans of martyrdom! Man, like the beast, is evil utterly, And man is highest of all things that be. THE PILGRIM. Man highest? Aye, of creatures, if thou wilt, And I will grant he hath an evil heart; But higher far than Man is very God. WORMWOOD. How? Is the Phantom greater than the Fact? The Shadow than the Substance casting it? THE PILGRIM. Not so; and therefore God is more than Man. WORMWOOD. Wrong at the catch—for Man is more than God; For out of Man, the creature of Man's heart, Colossal image of Man's entity, Comes God; and therefore, friend, thou followest Thine own dark shadow which thou deem'st divine, And since Man's heart is evil (as indeed Thou hast admitted now in fair round speech), Evil is God whom thou imaginest! The speaker laugh'd, and of that company Many laugh'd too, and I was answering him, When suddenly a hollow voice exclaim'd, ‘A song! a song!’ and rising from his seat With flashing eyes the maniac Poet sang: I have sought Thee, and not found Thee, I have woo'd Thee, and not won Thee— Wrap Thy gloomy veil around Thee, Keep Thy starry mantle on Thee— I am chamber'd far below Thee, And I seek no more to know Thee. Of my lips are made red blossoms; Of my hair long grass is woven; From the soft soil of my bosoms Springeth myrrh; my heart is cloven, And enrooted there, close clinging, Is a blood-red poppy springing. There is nothing of me wasted, Of my blood sweet dews are fashion'd, All is mixed and manifested In a mystery unimpassion'd. I am lost and faded wholly, Save these eyes, that now close slowly. And these eyes, though darkly glazing, With the spirit that looks through them, Both before and after gazing While the misty rains bedew them, From the sod still yearn full faintly For Thy shining soft and saintly. They are closing, they are shading, With the seeing they inherit— But Thou fadest with their fading, Thou art changing, mighty Spirit— And the end of their soft passion Is Thine own annihilation! All join'd the wild refrain, till with the sound The old inn shook. ‘Well sung!’ exclaim'd mine host, And stirr'd the feeble embers of the fire; And in the calm that follow'd, turning to me, The Jew smiled quietly and spake again:— ‘Good friend, since life is short, and man's heart evil, And death so near at every path we tread, Is it not best to clutch the goods we have, To trade, to barter, and to keep with thrift, Than to go wandering into mystic lands Seeking the City that can ne'er be seen? Put out of sight that bleeding Nazarene Whose shadow haunts our highways every-where, And, faith, the land we dwell in is a land Gracious and green and pleasant to the eye. Jew am I, but apostate from the God Who thunder'd upon Sinai, and indeed I love no form of thunder, but affect Calm dealings and smooth greetings with the world. For this is sure—that we are evil all, Earth-tainted, man and woman, beast and bird, We prey on one another, high and low; And if we cheat ourselves with phantasies, We miss the little thrift of time we have And perish ere our prime.’ ‘Most excellent,’ Cried Wormwood; ‘carpe diem—eat and live— To-morrow thou shalt die;’ and suddenly He rose and sang a would-be merry tune: Pour, Proserpine, thy purple wine Into this crystal cup, And wreathe my head with poppies red, While thus I drink it up. Then, marble bride, sit by my side, With large eyes fixed in sorrow, To-night we'll feast, and on thy breast I'll place my head to-morrow. Pale Proserpine, short space is mine To taste the happy hours, For thou hast spread my quiet bed, And strewn it deep in flowers. O grant me grace a little space, And shroud that face of sorrow, Till dawn of day I will be gay, For I'll be thine to-morrow. Am I not thine, pale Proserpine, My bride with hair of jet? Our bridal night is taking flight, But we'll not slumber yet; Pour on, pour deep! before I sleep One hour of mirth I'll borrow— Upon thy breast, in haggard rest, I'll place my head to-morrow. He ceased, and stillness on the circle came, Like silence after thunder, and again All gazed with dreary eyeballs on the fire. But now the chill and rainy dawn crept in And lighted all those faces with its beam. ‘To bed!’ cried one, and shivering I arose, And through great lobbies colder than the tomb, And up great carven stairs with curtains hung, I follow'd that pale handmaiden, who bare A chilly wind-blown lamp, until again I stood within the antique bedchamber, And setting down the light the maiden fix'd Her stony eyes on mine and said ‘Good-night;’ Then with no sound of footsteps flitted off, And left me all alone. Long time I paced The dreary chamber, haunted by the sound Of mine own footfalls, then I laid me down, Not praying unto God as theretofore, In the great bed, and by my bedside set The rushlight burning low; and all around The pallid pictures on the mouldering walls Look'd at me silcntly and seem'd to smile, While quietly the great bed's canopy Outstretch'd in rustling folds above my head. But as my senses faded one by one I seem'd to see those pallid Kings and Queens Descend and flit across the oaken floor With marble faces and blue rayless eyes; And that dark canopy above became A Christ upon His Cross, outstretching arms And bending down to look into my face With eyes of dumb, dead, infinite despair. BOOK VIII. THE OUTCAST, ESAU. O dreary dawn! from drearier dreams I woke, And found it gently creeping through the pane And shedding dusky silver on the floor; Whereon I rose, and slipping down the stairs, From chilly gallery to gallery I stole until I reach'd the ghostly hall; Yet, early as it was, Host Moth was up And shivering in his slippers at the door, For folk were bearing in upon a bier A ragged woman and her newborn child, Both dead, found frozen on the waste hard by, And the lean host was chiding querulously, Bidding them take their ghastly load elsewhere, Nor mar his custom with a sight so sad;— So intent was he, he scarcely seem'd to heed My greeting, but he clutch'd with eager hand The reckoning I tost him as I passed. Then out again upon the dreary waste I passed slow-footed, while a chilly wind Blew up along the black horizon line Dusk streaks of crimson like dead burnish'd leaves, And through their fluttering folds a gusty film Sparkled and melted into crystal dew. Then I was 'ware that straight across the waste There ran a dreary and an open way, With gloomy reaches of the sunless moor, And lonely tarns alive with ominous light, Stretching on either side; and by the tarns The bittern boom'd and the gray nighthern cried, And high in air against the dreary gleam A string of black swans waver'd to the south; But presently, as the dull daylight grew, I encounter'd men and women on the road Coming and going; all were closely wrapt, With eyes that sought the ground, but some strode by With frowning brows and haggard sleepless eyes: A melancholy race they seem'd indeed Of toilers on the moorland and the marsh. One I accosted, a tall, woeful man, Gaunt, clad in rags, and shivering in the cold, And question'd of the City and whither led That dreary open way; and for a space He answer'd not, but as a dumb man tries With foam-froth'd tongue to gather shreds of speech, Stood muttering, with his blank eyes gazing at me In wonder, but at last he found a voice. THE MAN. A City, master? Nay, I know of none, And in this country I was born and bred. THE PILGRIM. But whither runs this road across the waste? THE MAN. Far as a man may walk until he drops, And farther, league on league of loneliness. It leadeth—whither I know not, since my toil Keepeth me busy here upon the heath; But yonder to the right a rugged path Winds to the mountains, where, I have heard, there dwells A race of moonstruck madmen, mountaineers. THE PILGRIM. Alas! and toilest thou upon the ground, Nor seekest to be wandering far away, Upward and heavenward to the radiant place Where stands the City of God? THE MAN. I know not God, Nor any City of so strange a name; Yet I have often heard my granddam tell (When I was but a child) of some bright place Where folk might cease their weary work and rest; But, master, she died mad! My father saith, Who reared me up and made me toil for bread, That they are mad folk too who pass this way, Clad like thyself in pilgrim's robes and shoon Seeking that City and calling out on God. I left him standing like a marble man, With humbled head and heavily hanging brow, And wander'd on; and when my weary feet Had gone a little space, I backward gazed, And saw him gazing dumbly after me With vacant eyeballs; and the daylight grew; And many others pass'd with looks as dull, Faces as blank, and tread as sorrowful, And all seem'd little cheer'd by the dim dawn, But crawl'd to some dark taskwork on the waste; But some that pass'd on horseback carried loads Of corn and gold, as to some dreary mart. Deep darkness seal'd mine eyelids for a time, And when they open'd, opening still in dream, Amid mysterious shadows drifting by Confused and imageless, methought my form Now shone deep hidden, like a stormy moon; And fast I seem'd to fly, as seems the moon Through the swift tempest-rack to plough her way, Yet stirs not, but beholds the vaporous drift Floating and flying round her luminous feet. Nor could my troubled eyes distinguish well What land I walk'd in, or to what far bourne My slow feet fared, though dimly I discern'd A weary waste it was without a road, Figure of man, or sign of any star. Meseem'd that weary years had pass'd away Since first upon that lonely waste I fared, For ever struggling, yet for evermore As stationary as the storm-vex'd moon; And endless seem'd the heavy space of time. At last, as in the growing light of day The night-clouds thin, and in white wreaths of smoke, Soon kindled into crimson, float away, The shadows that across me darkly stream'd Grew fainter, melted, brighten'd, and dissolved, Till every shade was fled, the prospect clear, And once again I paused upon the path, Standing and gazing round me, solitary, 'Mid dusky gleams of dawn. Now, far away I saw the flashing of Christopolis Bright and remote as is a phantom city Seen in the sunset, and as sunset towers Crumble to golden vapour and are lost Strangely and quickly of their own bright will, So flash'd the holy City's walls and spires Dissolved by distance. 'Tween Christopolis And my now lingering feet stretch'd waste on waste, Weary, forlorn, abandon'd, without bound, With never wood or gentle cynosure, Or flash of silver stream, or human dwelling, To break its infinite monotony. There had I linger'd, thence my feet had fared, I knew not how; for all the way was dark Behind me, dim the sense and memory, And dimly sad; and all my wandering thither Was like an evil ill-remember'd dream; Nor yet of that forlornest solitude My feet were free, for round about me still Its dreary prospect dawn'd. While thus I stood Dejected, leaning heavy on my staff, I faintly heard, far off across the heath, The sound of horse's hoofs, which ever came Nearer and nearer; till mine eyes beheld Approaching, swift as any storm-swept cloud, A horseman with his wild hair backward streaming, His hands outreaching o'er his horse's mane; Quickly he came, and from the ground beneath Shot sparks of fire, for mighty was his steed Beyond all common steeds that stride the earth, Maned like a comet, and as black as clouds That blot a comet's path; And though its back was bare and 'tween its teeth It bare no bit, most tamely it obey'd The white hand twisted in its trembling mane; And ever with its bright eye backward flashing Neigh'd to the murmur of its rider's mouth, And ever sprang more swiftly on and on The more his hand caress'd. Onward it came; And now I saw that he who strode the steed Was slight and white and woman-like of form, Though on his pallid cheek there burn'd resolve Of mighty men; and his blue eye was fix'd On vacancy, so that he noted not The figure of the Pilgrim on his way; And he was flashing past with fair face set Like any star, when with one mighty bound The steed leapt back, its nostrils flashing fire, And striking up the sward with horny hoofs Stood quivering. Starting from his trance, like one Shaken from quiet sleep, the rider turn'd His face on mine, and, lo, that face was stern In pallor, and his dove-like eye became Keen as an eagle's fix'd upon its prey. ‘What man art thou?’ he question'd; and I said, Dejected, sick from very weariness, Scarce lifting up my head, ‘See for thyself! A pilgrim well-nigh spent!’ The horseman's face Grew brighter, though he laugh'd a bitter laugh, Then leaping from his seat but holding still His black steed's mane, quickly across the ground He pass'd, and coming close he gazed for long Into my face; then lightly laugh'd again, Saying, ‘Well met! Methinks I know thee now, Or else thy dreary cheek belies thy soul— Thou comest from Christopolis! How now? Hast thou been stoned i' the town, and have thy robes Been rent, and thou cast forth beyond the gate? Answer, and fear not! I who question thus Am outcast like thyself.’ Then did I tell, In hurried accents panting out my pain, My hope, my dream, my weary life-long quest, And all my sorrow in Christopolis; And how for many days and nights my feet Had struggled in the darkness of the waste; And how my light was lost, my strength nigh spent, My path all solitary; yea, how no Christ Could bring me comfort, and no God at all Could bring me peace—‘Because,’ I murmur'd low, ‘My heart is dead!’ Again that stranger laugh'd, And, answering him, the jet-black steed threw up His head and through great nostrils neigh'd aloud. Then cried he, ‘Toiler on the ground, too low Thou crawlest, even as a creeping thing. But knowest thou me?’ Whereon I answer'd, ‘Nay,’ And looking up more eagerly, beheld The light of starry eyes that shook with dew Of their exceeding lustre, wondrously. Then the clear voice, in accents sweet as song, Cried, ‘Christ they crucified, and thee they stoned, And me they would have given to the fire— Esau am I, call'd even after him Whom smooth sly Jacob of his birthright robb'd In times of old. Another Jacob sits In the high places of Christopolis, Eating my substance. Long ago I rode Into their Temples, overcasting them Who at the bloody altars minister'd; And in their market-places I proclaim'd Their god an idol and their creed a lie; And in the madness of mine own despair Wassail I held, with lemans at my side, In the dark centre of their midmost shrine, And there they found me and shrieking “Anti-Christ!” They would have slain me, but my steed was nigh, And on his back I sprang with laugh full shrill, Trampled their priests as dust beneath my feet, And through their dark throngs plunged, till once again On the fair waste I wander'd.’ Then I said, ‘Where dwellest thou?’ ‘Where doth the swift wind dwell, That on the high places and on the low, Homeless for ever, ever is found and lost? Even as the wind am I; the lonely woods, The torrents, the great solitary meres, Know me, and through their solitude I sail Even as amid the tempest sails the crane. All these have voices, crying as I pass Compassionless, alone; and from their speech And silent looks I have drunk deeper joy Than ever in any temple rear'd by hands The soul of man hath known. Wilt ride with me? O Pilgrim, wilt thou ride?’ So saying, he sprang Again upon his mighty sinewy steed, Which leapt for very joy beneath his weight, And holding out his white hand eagerly, He murmur'd, ‘Come!’ Then cried I, hesitating, ‘But whither? Knowest thou that fair City I seek, Or any place of peace?’ ‘Ask not, but come,’ Answer'd that other, while his black steed rear'd In act to paw the air and bound along— And ere I knew it I had ta'en the hand, And leaping on the steed was clinging tight To that pale horseman, who with wild laugh cried, ‘Away! away!’ As from a tense-strung bow Whistles the wingèd shaft, or as a star Shoots into space, the sable steed upleapt And bounded on; so swift its fiery speed, That to its rider pale I clung in fear, While underneath I saw the billowy heath Rush by me like a boiling whirling tide. I seem'd as one uplifted high in air, Sailing through ever-drifting clouds, between The regions of the flower and of the star, And for a time my head swam dizzily And in a trance of speed I closed mine eyes. Then in mine ears I seem'd to hear the rush Of many winds, the cry of many streams, The crash of many clouds; yet evermore I felt the beating of the horse's hoofs Beneath me, and its breathing like the sound Of fire blown from a forge. At first my soul Shrunk trembling, but betimes a new desire Uprose within my heart and in mine eyes Soon sparkled while they open'd gazing round; And I beheld with wild ecstatic thrills New prospects flashing past as dark as dream: For through a mighty wood of firs and pines Shapen like harps, wherefrom the rising wind Drew wails of wild and wondrous melody, The steed was speeding; and the stars had risen, Cold-sparkling through the jet-black naked boughs; And far before us in our headlong track Great torrents flash'd round gash'd and gaunt ravines; And higher glimmer'd rocks and crags and peaks, O'er which, with blood-red beams, 'mid driving clouds The windy moon was rising. Once again, I question'd, looking on the rider's face Which glimmer'd in the moonlight dim as death, ‘Whither, O whither?’ And the answer came, Not in cold speech or chilly undertone, But musically, in a wild strange song, To which the sobbing of the torrents round, The moaning of the wind among the pines, The beating of the horse's thunderous feet, Kept strange accord. Winds of the mountain, mingle with my crying, Clouds of the tempest, flee as I am flying, Gods of the cloudland, Christus and Apollo, Follow, O follow! Through the dark valleys, up the misty mountains, Over the black wastes, past the gleaming fountains, Praying not, hoping not, resting nor abiding, Lo, I am riding! Who now shall name me? Who shall find and bind me? Daylight before me, and darkness behind me, E'en as a black crane down the winds of heaven Fast I am driven. Clangour and anger of elements are round me, Torture has clasp'd me, cruelty has crown'd me, Sorrow awaits me, Death is waiting with her— Fast speed I thither! Not 'neath the greenwood, not where roses blossom, Not on the green vale on a loving bosom, Not on the sea-sands, not across the billow, Seek I a pillow! Gods of the storm-cloud, drifting darkly yonder, Point fiery hands and mock me as I wander, Gods of the forest glimmer out upon me, Shrink back and shun me! Gods, let them follow!—gods, for I defy them! They call me, mock me; but I gallop by them— If they would find me, touch me, whisper to me, Let them pursue me! Faster, O faster! Darker and more dreary Groweth the pathway, yet I am not weary— Gods, I defy them! gods, I can unmake them, Bruise them and break them! White steed of wonder, with thy feet of thunder, Find out their temples, tread their high-priests under,— Leave them behind thee—if their gods speed after, Mock them with laughter. Who standeth yonder, in white raiment reaching Down to His bare feet? Who stands there beseeching? Hark how He crieth, beck'ning with his finger, ‘Linger, O linger!’ Shall a god grieve me? Shall a phantom win me? Nay—by the wild wind around and o'er and in me— Be his name Vishnu, Christus, or Apollo— Let the god follow! Clangour and anger of elements are round me, Torture has clasp'd me, cruelty has crown'd me, Sorrow awaits me, Death is waiting with her — Fast speed I thither! And as the singer sang, Dark hooded creatures, moving through the woods In black processions, paused and echoed him; And on their faces fell the livid light, While to the wind-blown boughs they lifted hands; And from the torrent's bed a spirit shriek'd With eldritch cry. Still the black steed plunged on, And as it went it seem'd that spectral hands Were stretch'd to tear its rider from his seat, But laughing low he urged his eager steed, And from his beauty those frail phantoms fell Like flakes of cloud blown into gleaming air By the soft breathing of some patient star. Then upward, through the desolate ravines, Past flashing cataracts and torrent pools, Along dim ledges that in silence lean'd O'er horrible abysses dimly lit By mirror'd moons, the horseman held his way, Until he came unto a lonely sward As bright and green as verdure softly trod By elfin feet, which high among the crags Stretch'd in the moonlight. Like some abbey old Around whose crumbling walls and buttresses The ivy frosted white by moonlight twines, And whose deep floor of deep green grass is rough With fragments of old shrines and mossy graves, This lone spot seem'd; for round the stone-strewn grass The dark crags rose like builded walls and towers All dark and desolate and ivy twined, And through the open arches overhead The moon and stars shone in. Here from his seat (While I, too, leapt upon the grassy ground) Dark Esau lighted, and relinquishing His grasp upon the mighty horse's mane, Cried: ‘Feed thy fill!’ and o'er the silvern grass, Casting a shade gigantic, slowly walk'd The black steed, feeding gently as it went. ‘Behold my Temple!’ upward pointing cried That pallid wanderer—‘hark how the wind Intoneth with deep organ-voice amid These ivied lofts, and see how wondrously With spectral hand that white moon lifts the Host! Hither, when I am sick of wandering Like some dark spirit up and down the earth, I come by night, and pant my passing prayer To Him who made the tempest which ere long Shall gnaw the heartstrings of Christopolis! Hither the white Christ comes not, nor His priests, Nor any feet of slaves; and here thy soul May rest a space and worship at its will Whatever god thou choosest, or indeed, May make an idol of its own despair, And kneeling, pray to that!’ The wild wind wail'd, The dark clouds drifted even as driving waves Over the moon, while 'mid the ivied crags The screech-owl cried. Then said I, shivering, Yet feeling still my eager heart abeat With all the ecstasy of that mad ride, ‘Most cheerless is thy Temple!—and its god Only the god o' the storm!’ ‘Cheerless, perchance,’ Answer'd the outcast one, ‘yet not unblest— For lo! 'tis gentle, and its altar-stones Cemented are with no poor innocent blood Drawn from the throat of lambs or lamb-like men; And from its porches Lazarus is not driven; And in its inmost shrines the priests of Baal Are not upheaping gold. Better such cheer, Though bitter as the bruisèd heart of Love, Than merry music of a thousand choirs Drowning the moans of sad humanity; Than glory of a thousand golden shrines, Each one of which shuts up within its folds A thousand hearts still beating and still bleeding! This is my Temple; and its god, thou sayst, Is but the Storm-god?—Blessings on that god! Upon his burning eyes and night-black hair, His dark breath and the fire around his feet! For rock'd in his wild arms the soul of man May find the comfort of divine unrest. O, who could dwell upon the dreary earth, Hark to the wretched wailing, and behold The terror and the anarchy of Nature, And keep his heart from breaking, did he never Upleap and rush into the whirl of things, And like a wild cloud driven up and down Ease the mad motion of his life in tears? My Storm-god—hear him cry! my god o' the winds, List to him, list!—for as he murmureth there He murmur'd to the wind-blown tribes o' the Jew!— More holy he than yonder hungry Lamb, Who, pale and impotent in gentleness, Sits in His niche complacent and beholds Those hecatombs of broken hearts which priests, In blood-red robes adjusted smilingly, Pile on His altars!’ All erect he stood, Pale as an angel in the white-heat gleam Of Heaven's central sun, and from his eyes Gleam'd light now lovely and now terrible; And in the cloudy wrack above his head Answer'd the Storm-god with a clangour of wind Like far-off thunder. Silent for a space I waited, for the words within my heart Woke awful echoes, but at last I spake, Saying: ‘Yea, there is wisdom in thy words— Better to wander up and down the world All outcast, or in Nature's stormy fanes To pray in protestation and despair, Than in Christopolis with priests and slaves To gnaw the frozen crust of a cold creed Amid the brazen glory of a lie. Yet am I weary of much storm, and fain To rest by quiet waters. Blest be thou, If thou canst guide me thither.’ Passionately The wanderer laugh'd, brushing with thin white hand The long hair blown into his burning eyes— ‘By quiet waters? I have search'd the world And found them not; yea, not from Zion hill, Nor from the brighter sides of Helicon, Such waters flow;—and all that I have seen Are stony to the sight, and to the taste Most bitter!’ ‘Woe is me! If this be so, Where shall we rest our feet?’ ‘Rest not at all,’ He answer'd. ‘Doth the cloud rest, or the stream, Or sun, or star, or any shape that moves Still onward, by its dim will piloted, As solitary as the soul of man? Be thou a meteor blown from place to place, Still testifying up and down the earth Against the power that made thee miserable; Then die! soul-sure thou hast not lived in vain, If with thy hand ere dying thou hast smitten Some hateful Altar down!’ Then did I cry, In darkness and in agony and despair: ‘O misery! Is there no light at all To guide my footsteps on? What country lies Beyond these hills?’ Answer'd the Wanderer: ‘A land of Shepherds—in the vales beyond The flocks of Faunus feed.—Why, how thy face Is shining!’ THE PILGRIM. Lead me thither—very sweet The name is, and methinks the land is fair. A shepherd there 'mong shepherds I will hear The brook flow, see the sheep upon the heights Trickling like silvern streams;—and, if I can, Forget mine own mad quest. ESAU. Mount, if thou wilt, And I will lead thee thither; but remember They knee strange gods. THE PILGRIM. Strange gods? ESAU. Yea, strange and dead. Still bleeding, with a dove upon his lips, Down its bright streams the slain Adonis floats; 'Mid its deep umbrage Faunus lies his length Strewn by the robin redbreast and the wren With gentle leaves; and in some dumb, dark mere, With all the lustrous ooze about his hair, Lies drownèd Pan! THE PILGRIM. Sweet gods! I know them well. Surely the land wherein they sleep is blest, A land of peace; surely thy stormy soul Might there have found its place of rest? ESAU. The dead Shall never have my worship! Fair indeed The land is, and amid its woods and vales A space I wander'd, till its flowery breath, Rich as the breathing of a summer rose, Oppress'd my soul to swooning. So again I rode into the tempest of the world! Better to be the weariest-wingèd cloud That to and fro about the shoreless heaven Flieth without a spot to rest its feet; Better to be the weariest wave that breaks Moaning and dying on Thought's shoreless sea, Than the supremest blossom born i' the wood And like a snow-flake shed upon the ground! Oh, I have rested in a hundred bowers, And should have dream'd to death a thousand times, But that the clarion of mine own despair Found me and woke me. For this head of mine Earth finds no pillow!—I have cradled it On breasts of women warm with wildest love, And sighing low, ‘Here is my heaven at last,’ I have sunken down into delicious sleep; But lo! the very billowing of those breasts, The very come-and-go of Love's own heart, Hath waken'd me!—with every hot pulse beating I have risen, and, upspringing to my feet, Heard the far trumpet blowing! As he spake, His face flash'd like a star, and, raising hands To the dark, dripping wrack above his head, He trembled as a tree in the mad wind Of his wild words; then whistling to his steed,— Which came unto him tame as any hound, With foot that paw'd the ground and eyes of fire,— He cried: ‘To horse; and onward!’ To his seat Smiling he leapt, and, hesitating not, I follow'd, clinging round his slender waist With eager hands; and swiftly once again The lonely ride began. Meseem'd we rode For many nights and days, yet day and night Were strangely mingled, and my senses lost True count of time. Through desolate ravines, O'er lonely mountain-peaks, and down the beds Of vanish'd torrents, our strange pathway lay; And fleeter than the feet of swift izzards That twinkle on the Pyrenean crags Where never man may creep or sheep may crawl, The feet of that swift steed, from spot to spot, Moved, never slipping and for ever sure. Ever above us moan'd the winds and moved The clouds wind-driven; ever with low voice Dark Esau sang; and in his songs he named The death-star and the birth-star and the signs Of Adam, and of Christ, and Antichrist; And sometimes of dark woods and waters wild, And of the snow upon the mountain-tops, He wove wild runes, and scatter'd them like flowers Under the trampling footsteps of the storm. So rode we on and on. At last, meseem'd The pace grew slower, the steed's fiery breath More gentle, while upon my face there fell A warmth like sunlight. Gazing round, I saw That we were riding down a green hillside, Flowers and grass were growing underfoot, The summer sun was shining, and a lark Uprose before the horse's very feet, Singing! Still slower grew the dark steed's pace, And now upon the brightening sward his hoofs Fell soft as fruit that falleth from the bough; While Esau, ceasing his mad minstrelsy, Relax'd his hold upon the flowing mane, And with his chin sunk forward on his breast, Frown'd darkly, in a dream. Beneath us lay A mighty Valley, darken'd everywhere With woods primæval, whose umbrageous tops Roll'd with the great wind darkly, like a sea; And waves of shadow travell'd softly on Far as the eye could see across the boughs, And upward came a murmur deep and sweet, Such as he hears who stands on ocean sands On some divine, dark day of emerald calm. And when we rode into the greenness stretch'd Beneath us, and along the dappled shades Crept slowly on a carpet mossy and dark, It seemèd still as if with charmèd lives We walk'd some wondrous bottom of the Deep. For pallid flowers and mighty purple weeds, Such as bestrew the Ocean, round us grew, Soft stirring as with motions of the ooze; And far above, the boughs did break like waves To foam of flowers and sunlight, with a sound Solemn, afar off, faint as in a dream! Now ever lull'd by that deep melody, Dark Esau held his chin upon his breast, And gazing neither right nor left, rode on With deeper frown. So stole we slowly on Through that green shade. Suddenly on our ears There came a sound of sylvan melody, Deep, like the lover's lute; and 'mid that sound A voice rose clear and sparkling as a fountain Upleaping from some nest of greenery. Dark Esau raised his head, and his twain eyes Grew luminous as any serpent's orbs, Watching a space of sunlight bright as gold Which open'd through the boughs before his path. And soon meseem'd into that sunny space Slowly he rode, and dazzled in the gleam, Stood glorified and shading both his brows; And there, beside the sparkle of a stream, I saw a Shepherd and a Shepherdess Sit smiling; and upon a shepherd's pipe The wight play'd soft and low, while loud and clear, Sitting and clasping hands around her knees, And gazing at the glimmer overhead, The Maiden sang! Dark were the Shepherd's locks, Threaded with silvern grey, and on his face A brownness as of ripen'd fruitage lay; And though the fever of his youth was past, His black eyes flash'd with some deep inner fire Wherein his heart was burning. O'er his brow A fillet green he wore; around his form A mantle azure as the open heaven, And wrought with lilies like to heavenly stars; Dark shoon upon his feet, and by his side There lay a gentle crook Arcadian. Him did I quickliest mark, and whisper'd low: ‘What wight is he that plays?’—and Esau said, Now smiling darkly and in mockery: ‘Thyrsis, the shepherd of the flocks of Faun; He saw Diana pass one summer night In all the wonder of her nakedness. He was a boy then, but his hair that hour Was silver'd; since that hour he hath not smiled, But on his cheek the wonder of that sight Still flashes flame!’ He added, while his eye Kindled to feverish rapture: ‘Turn thine eyes On her who sings beside him in the sun! Was ever hamadryad half so fair? He found her even like any fallen flower In the warm heart o' the wood one summer night, And wanton spirits whisper'd in his ear That she was Dian's child. He took the babe, And rear'd her as his own; and there she sits Fairer than Dian's self!’ Fairer, indeed, Than any woman of a woman born Was that strange Shepherdess. Her face was bright As sunlight, but her lips were poppy-red, And o'er her brows and alabaster limbs The lilies and the roses interblent In that full glory. Raven-black her hair, And black her brows o'er azure eyes that swam With passionate and never-ceasing fires Deep hidden 'neath her snows; most brilliantly They burnt, but with no trembling, fitful light, Nay, rather, steady as two vestal stars; And though their flame was passionately bright, Soul-'trancing, soul-consuming, yet it seem'd Most virginal and sweetly terrible, Chaste with the splendour of an appetite That never could be fed on food of earth, Or stoop to quench its chastity with less Than perfect godhead. As the steed drew near, She ceased her song, and fix'd on Esau's face Her melting eyes; and paler than the dead He turn'd, his lips like ashes, and his hand Held heavily on his heart. She did not stir, Nor smile, nor did her shining features change; But quietly the elder Shepherd rose And stood erect, but leaning on his crook In silence, while dark Esau, with a smile, Grim as the smile upon a corpse's face, Forced from his heart a hollow laugh, and cried: ‘Ho, Thyrsis! see, what guest I bring to thee! Another Pilgrim sick of Christ and God, And eager for the clammy kiss of Earth— Aye, or content, if thou wilt have it so, To sleep on Dian's breast!’ The Shepherd raised His hand in deprecation, answering low: ‘Blaspheme not, Esau! she thou names is Too holy for thy lips!’—then courteously Turning to me, who now upon the grass Had leapt with eager feet, he bow'd his head, Saying, ‘Be welcome! May thy soul find rest In these green shades!’ But Esau, with his eyes Still fix'd upon the maiden feverishly, Echoed him: ‘Rest! God help him! Rest with thee?’ ‘Why not?’ the Shepherd said, not angrily, But softly as the rippling runlet falls. The other answer'd not, but laugh'd aloud, And pointed with his fingers mockingly At the pale Maiden, who unto her feet Rose like a spirit, shining, with no sound. Then Esau cried, with quick laugh like a shriek, ‘Away!’—and as the laughter left his lips, The steed sprang on across the golden glade And plunged into the umbrage suddenly; But ere it faded Esau's pallid face Cast one last look behind on her who shone Still as a star. Then did my soul Marvel in sooth to hear the names of gods Falling so simply from the Shepherd's tongue;— For reverently, with lowly-lidded eyne, The Shepherd spake, and reverently his child Gazed upward, like to one who seeth afar The dewy star-point of an angel's wing. Wherefore I murmur'd, half to those who heard, Half to myself: ‘Gods!—but the gods are dead!’ And Thyrsis answer'd: ‘As the pallid Christ, Swathen in burial linen icy cold, Sepulchred deep, and sealèd with a stone, Yet walking from His grave, and withering The grass of centuries with feet of fire, As He is dead, so they! If He abides, They are not lost!—and though the eye of Faith Hath grown too dim to trace their forms divine, The gods survive, heirs of their own green realm, Inheritors of immortality! For this is fatal:—to be beautiful, Is to be thrice divine, as Dian is!’ And as he named the blessed name again His face shone with its pale beatitude.Softly the Shepherd sigh'd, And to the questioning look upon my face Made answer: ‘Dian, give that wanderer peace! None other, god or goddess, ever can! I see thou marvellest much at his wild words, And wilder looks.—Sir, 'tis the old, sad tale. He loved my child, whom I in reverence Named Dian, after Dian the divine, The holy ministress of these dark woods. He loved her, as full many a wight hath done, But never upon any man that lives She smileth, and methinks the good gods will That she shall die a maid!’ ‘But come!’ he cried—‘dwell with us for a space, And I will guide thee through our woodland realm, And tell thee of its secrets one by one. The fever of the world is on thy face, The wormwood of the Priest is on thy heart; And here by quiet waters thou shalt brood On shapes of beauty till thy thought becomes As beautiful as that it broodeth on.’ He ceased; I answer'd not; my soul was wrapt In contemplation of the flower-crown'd Maid, Who turning on me, softly as a star Opens in heaven, all the dreamful light Of her still face, stood gazing into mine With all the wonder of immortal eyes Tremulous with unutterable desire That never could be fed. Then, even as one Under enchantment, spell-bound by that face, Still gazing on it in a burning awe, In a low voice I answer'd, ‘I will stay!’ BOOK IX. THE GROVES OF FAUN. Still listening to that stately Eremite, And gently gazing on the snowy Maid Who glided on before us golden-hair'd, We pass'd into a mighty forest grove, When on mine eager ears there swept a sound Of birds innumerable on leafy boughs Singing aloud!—and as we softly trod The mossy carpet of the broad bright glade, With trees of ancient growth on either side, We suddenly beheld a group of forms, That, clustering before us on the sward, With large, brown, lustrous eyes fix'd full on ours, Stood like a startled flock of fallow-deer Prepared to spring away; yet shaped like men Were these, though hairy were their limbs, their feet Cloven like feet of swine, and all their ears, That large and hairy twinkled in the sun, Prick'd up to listen. Golden shone the light Upon them, and their shadows on the sward Were softly strewn, as thither with quick cry Hasten'd the Maid; but, ere into their midst Her feet could spring, they ev'n as startled deer Leapt, flitted, vanish'd, with a faint, wild cry Like human laughter on a hill-top heard, Forlorn and indistinct; but as their shapes Vanish'd afar, deep down the emerald glade A thousand sylvan echoes answer'd them, And from the leaves on either side the way Innumerable faces flash'd, as fair As ever wood-nymph wore. Then did I know Those glades were haunted by the flocks of Faun; The Satyr dwelt there, and the Sylvan throng, And in the wood's hot heart the Naïad fill'd The hollow of her white outstretchèd hand With drops of summer dew. And as I went I gladden'd more; for never groves of earth Were half so fair as those wherein I trod. Statues of marble, mystically wrought, Gleam'd in the open spaces cool and white As shapes of snow; and here and there were strewn The ruin'd steps of marble white and red, Or broken marble columns moss-bestain'd, That show'd where once a Temple had been raised To Pan or Faunus, or some lesser god Of wood or stream; and though those temples fair Were overthrown, the Spirits unto whom They had been raised were there, and merry amid The ruins of the shrine. ‘I know them well,’ I murmur'd, smiling, ‘these enchanted groves, Where Faunus leads his legions ruminant; And where Selene, with soft silvern feet, Walks every summer night; and well I know They are but conjurations of the sense Which sees them—shadows, neither less nor more, Of Nature's primal joy.’ The Shepherd smiled, And said: ‘The substance, not the shadow. These, And all such joyous images as these, Are elemental—weary were the world Whence they were wholly flown. Once on a time They peopled the wide earth, and man might mark At every roadside, and by every door, Flower-crown'd Priapus, the fair child of Pan, Close kin to Love and Death; but now they haunt Only the places of the solitude Where mortals seldom creep. Seen or unseen, Known or unknown, they are immortal, part Of that eternal youth and happiness Which first created them, and whence they draw Their brightness and their being.’ Silently We wander'd on, and now our footsteps fell In scented shade. From every nook i' the leaves A Spirit peep'd; o'erhead from every bough A Spirit sang!—and ever and anon, Out of the flower-enwoven and emerald gloom, White arms were waved, while voices soft as sleep Did whisper, ‘Come!’ Calm through the thronging flowers Whose honey'd sweets were crushed against his lips, The Shepherd trod. The bright light fell subdued Upon the snow of his divine grey hair, And every woodland Spirit that upsprang To clasp him in her warm and naked arms, Gazed for a moment in his solemn eyes, Then like a fountain falling sank in shame To kiss his feet. The marble Maiden moved Untouch'd by any of the glittering beams, Pure as a dewdrop the light gleams upon Yet cannot drink, while lost in light my soul Sprang from its sheath of sorrow, and in the sun Hover'd like any golden butterfly! I leapt i' the joyful air, I laugh'd aloud, I stretch'd mine arms to every flashing form, I kiss'd fair faces fading into flowers, I drank the sunshine down like golden wine; And, lastly, sinking on a rainbow'd bank, O'er-canopied by faces, forms, and eyes, That changed and changed to radiant fruit and flowers With every breathing of the summer wind, I cried, ‘Farewell! Leave me to linger here. My quest was vain, but oh, these bowers are blest! I'll roam no further! ‘Rise!’ the old man said; ‘Who linger in these vales of vain delight Perish betimes; it is thy privilege To share as doth a master, not a slave, Fair Nature's primal joy! On every side See scatter'd those who lie too wholly lost Ever to rise again.’ And all around, Across the tangled paths on every side, I saw indeed that many mortal shapes Were fallen like o'er-ripe fruit; and many of these Were clad as if for heavenly pilgrimage, Yea, arm'd with staff and scrip; but o'er them bent Women so lustrous and so sweetly pale They seem'd of marble and moonlight interblent And yet so bright and warm in nakedness They seem'd of living flesh. Ah, God, to see Their syren faces, dead-eyed like the Sphynx, Yet lustrous-cheek'd, with bright vermilion lips Like poppy-flowers! Yet sadder still than theirs The faces that below them on the grass Flash'd amorous of the very breath they drew! Pale youths and students Time had snow'd upon; Gaunt poets, clasping to their cold breast-bones Their harps of gold; and hunters, clad in green, Gross-mouth'd and lewd; and kings, that proffer'd crowns For one cold kiss; and senile agèd men, Who shook like palsied leaves upon the tree With every thrill of sylvan melody That breathed beneath the overhanging boughs. These things beholding, to my feet I sprang With piteous cry, and as I gazed around Low voices from the scented darkness sang, In slumbrous human tones:— Kiss, dream, and die!—Love, let thy lips divine In one long heavenly kiss be seal'd to mine, While singing low the flower-crown'd Hours steal by— Thy beauty warms my blood like wondrous wine— While yet the sun hangs still in yonder sky, Kiss, dream, and die! Dream,—while I kiss!—Dream, in these happy bowers, Thy naked limbs and body strewn with flowers, Thy being scented thro' with balmy bliss— Dream, love, of heavenly light and golden showers, Melting to touch of lips, like this—and this— Dream, while I kiss! Kiss, while I dream!—Kiss with thy clinging lips, With clasp of hands and thrill of finger-tips, With breasts that heave and fall, with eyes that beam— Long, lingering, as the wild-bee clings and sips, Deep, as the rose-branch trail'd in the hot stream,— Kiss, while I dream! Kiss, dream, and die!—Love, after life comes Death, No spirit to rapture reawakeneth When once Love's sun hath sunk in yonder sky— Cling closer, drink my being, drain my breath,— Soul answering soul, in one last rapturous sigh, Kiss, dream, and die! As the voice ceased, There flash'd across the haunted forest-path A flock so strange that even the happy Maid Stood still, and gazed. A Spirit led the way Like Bacchus crown'd with grapes and leaves of vine, And wingèd too like Love; but underneath The falling tresses of his golden hair A death's head smiled; on a white steed he rode Caparison'd with gold; and at his back The tumult follow'd—Satyrs, Nymphs, and Fauns, Pale Queens with crowns; dishevell'd naked maids; Priapus next, the laughing garden-god, Raining ripe fruit around and leaves of gold; Then Ethiop dancers, clashing cymbals bright; And after them, supreme among the rest, A livid Conqueror like Cæsar's self With wild beasts chainèd to his chariot-wheels; Behind him drunken legions blood-bestain'd, With captives wailing in their midst. These pass'd; Then, mounted on a jet-black stallion's back, Herodias, bearing in her naked lap A hoary, bleeding head; and after her A troop commingled from all times and climes— Pale knights in armour, on whose shoulders sat Nixes or elves; Goths, mighty-limb'd and grim; Pale monks, with hollow cheeks and lean long hands; Nuns from the cloister, whose wild, hectic cheeks Burn'd red as blood between their ghastly bands; And bringing up the rear a hideous flock Of idiot children, twisted with disease, And laughing in a mad and mindless mirth. And gazing after them with gentle eyes The old man sigh'd: ‘They follow Death, not Love!— From every corner of the populous earth They come to mar that primal happiness Which is the root of being!’ But I cried, Raising my hands: ‘Is it not pitiful? Is it not hateful and most pitiful? Lo, out of every innocent bower of flowers, And out of every bed where Love may sleep, The Shape with “Thanatos” upon its brow Dreadfully peeps! Why may not Man be glad, Forgetting death and darkness for an hour? Is it so evil to be happy? Nay! Yet the one cup God proffers to his seed Is wormwood, wormwood!’ As I spake the Maid, Coming upon a little mossy well, That fill'd up softly as a dewy eye And ever look'd at heaven through azure tears, Stood white as any lamb upon the brink, And on her dim sweet double down below Dropt leaves and flowers, and smiled for joy to see Her image broken into flakes of snow But ever mingling beautiful again Whene'er the soft shower ceased. While on her face, Serene yet masterful in innocence, I gazed in awe, the old man answer'd me: ‘Ev'n as the Gorgon mother ate her young, Nature for ever feeds on and consumes Those creatures who, too frail to quit her breast, Miss the full height and privilege of Man! I say again that Man was made supreme, Radiant and strong, to conquer with a smile The transports that he shares; And he by wisdom or by innocence May conquer if he will; And surely he who learns to conquer Love Hath learnt to conquer Death! Behold my child! See where she stands like marble 'mid the beam That beats so brightly on her sinless brows. As she is, must thy soul be—if thy soul Would read our creed aright.’ But I return'd, Bitterly smiling, ‘She? thine icicle! Cold to the kiss of Man, what knoweth she Of love or joy?’ Still as a star her face Turn'd full upon me, with a beam so sad, So strange in sorrow and divine despair, My heart within me shook; and though she had heard She spake not, but moved onward silently; And sinking low his voice, and following her, Her foster-father cried: ‘Is there no joy But riot? Is there no immortal love To make eternal hunger sweeter far Than lustful feasts? O blind and wayward one, Hadst thou but seen what these sad eyes have seen, The passionate eternal purity Walking these shadowy woods with silvern feet! I bear the lifelong glory in my heart, And with the splendour of its own despair My soul is glad!’ I answer'd him again, Still mocking, ‘Keep thy vision!—she, perchance, Some night may look on hers!’ ‘By night and day,’ Return'd the Shepherd very solemnly, ‘By night and day my child beholdeth him, And quencheth all the fiery flame o' the sense Against his image, and is sadly glad. Perchance ere long thine eyes may see him too, And kiss his holy feet as she hath done. But now,’ he added, looking sadly down On the bright bowers around him, ‘stay not here; For if thou dost, we twain must part, and thou Fade back to flower, or dwindle back to beast, As these thou seest are doing momently. Come!’ And he held me gently with his hand, And drew me softly on. Like one that sleeps, And sleeping seems to totter heavy-eyed Through woods of poppy and rank hellebore, Feebly I moved; my head swam; on my lips Linger'd sour savours as of dregs of wine, And all my soul with sick and shameful thirst Woke, as a drunkard after deep debauch Wakes to the shiver of a glimmering dawn. In vain ripe fruits were crush'd against my lips, In vain the branches with their blossom'd arms Entwined around me; vainly in my face The naked dryad and the wood-nymph laugh'd. Past these I drave as fiercely as a ship Before the beating of a bitter wind, And crushing fruit and blossom under foot, Tearing the tangled tracery apart, I wander'd on for hours. Nor did I pause Till from that wondrous Grove my feet had pass'd, And once again in open glades we stood Under the azure canopy of heaven. Now I beheld we stood upon the bank Of a broad river flowing along between Deep banks of flowering ferns and daffodils— A gentle river winding far away Under green trees that hung their laden boughs And shed their fruits upon it lavishly; Yet cool the water seem'd, and silvern bright As any star, and on the boughs above it Sat doves as white as snow, brooding for joy,— And by its brim one crane of glittering gold With bright shade lengthening from the pensive light Stood, knee-deep in the mosses of the marge. Slowly my sense grew clear. ‘What place is this?’ I murmur'd; ‘Say, what place divine is this— God's home, or Love's, or Death's!’ but in mine ear The gentle voice replied, ‘Question no more, But at the brink stoop down, and bathe thy brows; And if thou thirstest, drink!’ So on the marge I stoop'd, and in my hollow'd hand did lift The waters, scattering them upon my face, And tasting; and the fever from my frame Fell like an unclean robe, and stretching arms I, like a man rejoicing in his strength, Stood calm and new-baptized. Tall by the lake The old man tower'd, and I beheld his face Was shining as an angel's, with new light Of rapture in his eyes; and by his side The Maid, with lips apart and eager eyes, Stood bathed in glory of her golden hair And the great sunlight that encircled her! Scarce had I drunk, when I was 'ware of One Who through the green glades by the river's brim Walk'd, like a slow star sailing through the clouds Of twilight; yea, the face of him afar Shone starlike, and around his coming feet The moon-dew shone. As white and still he seem'd As some fair form of marble brought to life And gliding in the glory of a dream; But from his frame, at every step he took, Shot light which never yet from marble gleam'd, And splendour that was never seen in stone. For raiment, backward from his shoulders blown, He wore a scarf diaphanous; round his form A chlamys of the whitest woof of lambs; But all uncover'd was his golden hair, His feet unsandall'd. ‘Who is this that comes?’ Trembling I cried. But suddenly on his knees The old man fell, with head submissive bent In gentle adoration. Then, methought: ‘The City of my Dream is close at hand, And this is He who comes to lead me thither!’ And wonder'd much that while the old man knelt, The Maid leapt forward with outstretching arms, And with less fear than hath a yeanling lamb Feeling its mother on a mead in May, Thrust out her hand and took his hand who came And brightening in his brightness led him on With bird-like cries. Then I perceived her face Now smiling glorified, and straight I knew That she was gazing on the lonely love Of her young soul; that all her maiden dream Was shining there in substance, fairer far Than star or flower; that on his face she fed In palpitating awe, so strange, so deep, She did not even kiss the holy hand She held within her own. ‘Who comes? who comes?’ I murmured to the old man once again; ‘A god—the messenger of gods—his name? He smileth; mine eyes dazzle in the light Of his bright smiling!’ And the other cried, Not rising, ‘To thy knees! and veil thine eyes, Lest the ecstatic ray his presence sheds Blind thee apace! He hath a thousand names, All sweet; but in these glades his holiest name Is Eros!’ ‘Eros!’ rapturously I sighed; And tottering as one drunken in the sun, Fell at his feet who came; and the pale Maid, Upleaping in the brightness, fountain-like, Cried, ‘Eros! Eros!’ leading Eros on, While the birds sang and every echo rang. There was a pause, as when in golden June The heavens, the glassy waters, and the hills Throb wrapt in mists of heat as in a dream, So that the humming of the tiniest gnat Is heard while in the moted ray it swings,— There was a pause and silence for a space, But soon the Shepherd, rising reverently, Cried: ‘Master of these golden groves of Faun, All hail! Unto thy sacred place I bring A Pilgrim from the dusty tracts of Time, A seeker of the secret Beautiful No ear hath heard; and from the summer bowers, The gardens, and the glades of vain delight, Latest he comes, still fever'd from the flush Of those bright bowers. Him to thy feet I bring, And if his soul be worthy, thou perchance Mayst heal his pain!’ He ceased; and on the air There rose the thrill of the divinest voice That ever on a starry midnight charm'd The swooning sense of lovers unto dream,— A voice divine, and in a tongue divine It spake,—such Greek, such honey'd liquid Greek As Psyche heard that night beneath the stars She threw her rose-hung casement open wide And stood with lamp uplifted, welcoming Her love, storm-beaten in his saffron veil. ‘What seeks he?’ ask'd the voice; and lo! I cried, Uplifting not mine eyes: ‘O gentle God, Surely I seek that City Beautiful, From whence thou comest! Dead I fancied thee, Fallen with that glorious umbrage of dead gods Which doth bestrew the forest paths of Greece; And since thou livest, I can seek no guide More beautiful than thou!’ Whereon again, Burning like amber in the golden beam, That nightingale of deities replied, ‘O child of man, can the Immortal die? To love, is to endure; and lo, I am; But from that City Beautiful thou namest I come not, and I cannot guide thy steps Thither, nor further than mine own fair realm.’ Smiling I answer'd, rising to my feet: ‘If this thy realm is, Spirit Paramount, Let me abide within it close to thee! Peace dwelleth here, and Light; and here at last, As in a crystal mirror, I perceive The clouds and forms of being stream subdued Through azure voids of immortality.’ ‘Come, then,’ said Eros, smiling beautiful; ‘And for a season I will lead thy feet, That thou mayst know my secret realm and me!’ And as he spake he waved his shining hand, And lo, the cluster'd lilies of the stream Again were parted by invisible airs, And through the waters came a shallop slight, Drawn by white swans that cleft the crystal mere With webbèd feet as soft as oilèd leaves, And in the shallop's brow a blood-red star Burnt wondrous, with its image in the mere Broken 'mid ripples into rubied lines. Slow to the bank it came, and there it paused, So slight, so small, it seem'd no mortal shape Might float upon the crystal mere therein; And Eros pointed, silent, to the boat, But I, half turning to my greyhair'd guide, Question'd with outstretch'd hands and glance of eyes, ‘And thou?’ The Shepherd smiled, with gentle hand Restraining now the Maid, who, stretching arms, Would fain have follow'd that diviner Form On whom her eyes were fasten'd, ring in ring Enlarging, like the iris-eyes of doves. ‘Farewell!’ he said; ‘further I fare not friend! For whosoever sails that crystal stream Must with the golden godhead sail alone. My path winds homeward, back to the sunny glades Where first we met. Farewell! a long farewell! If ever backward through these groves of Faun Thou comest, seek that Valley where I dwell, And tell me of thy quest!’ Methought I raised The Maid, and set upon her brow the seal Of one long kiss; but me she heeded not, Gazing in fascination deep as Death On that calm god; then, stooping low, I kiss'd The Shepherd's hand, and enter'd the bright boat That on the shallow margin of the river Did droop the glory of its rubied star Like some bright water-flower. Beneath my weight The shallop trembled, but it bare me up; And slowly through the shallows lily-sown It moved, pulsating on the throbbing stream As white and warm as bosoms of the swans That drew it. In its wake the godhead swam, Gold crown'd; and from beneath the mere his limbs Gleam'd, like the flashing of a salmon's sides. Slowly it seem'd to sail, yet swiftly now The shore receded, till the Man and Maid Beyond the mists of brightness disappear'd, And ever till they faded utterly Moveless the Maiden's face as any star Shone tremulous with innocent desire, And when they vanish'd, from the vanish'd shore There came a quick and solitary cry That wither'd on the wind. Then forth we fared, Till nought was seen around us or above But golden glory of the golden Day Reflected from the bosom of the mere As from a blinding shield; and, lo! my sense Grew lost in dizziness and deep delight: All things I saw as in a dazzling dream, And drooping o'er them drowsily gazed down Into the crystal depths whereon I sail'd. Then was I 'ware that underneath me throbb'd Strange vistas, dim and wonderful, wherein The great ghost of the burning sun did shine Subdued and dim, amid a heaven as blue, As blue and deep, as that which burnt o'erhead; And in the under-void like gold-fish gleam'd Innumerable Spirits of the lake, Naked, blown hither and thither light as leaves, With lilies in their hands, their eyes half closed, Their hair like drifting weeds; thick as the flowers Above, they floated; near the surface some, And others far away as films of cloud In that deep under-heaven; but all their eyes Were softly upturn'd, as to some strange star, To him who in the shallop's glittering wake Swam 'mid the light of his lone loveliness. Then all grew dim! I closed my heated eyes, Like one who on a summer hill lies down Face upward, blinded by the burning blue, And in my ears there grew a dreamy hum Of lark-like song. The heaven above my head, The heaven below my feet, swam swiftly by, Till clouds and birds and flowers and waterelves Were blent to one bright flash of rainbow light Bewildering the sense. And now I swam By jewell'd islands smother'd deep in flowers Glassily mirror'd in the golden river; And from the isles blue-plumaged warblers humm'd Swinging to boughs of purple, yellow, and green, Their pendent nests of down; and on the banks, Dim-shaded by the umbrage and the flowers, Sat naked fauns who fluted to the swans On pipes of reeds, while in the purple shallows, Wading knee-deep, listen'd the golden cranes, And walking upon floating lotus-leaves The red jacana scream'd. Still paramount Shone Eros, piloting with lily hand His shallop through the waters wonderful, And wheresoe'er he went his brightness fell Celestial, turning all the saffron pools To crimson and to purple and to gold. Calm were his eyes and steadfast, with a light Which in a face of aspect less divine Would have seem'd sad, and on his brows there lay A golden shadow of celestial thought. Thus in my dream I saw him floating on, While with dim eyes of rapture downward turn'd, I feasted on his beauty silently; And under him the strange abysses swoon'd And o'er his head the azure heaven stoop'd down; And even as a snow-white steed that runs Pleased with its burthen, merrily hasting on, The river rambled on from bank to bank, In curves of splendour winding serpentine. Betimes it broaden'd into bright lagoons Sown with innumerable crimson isles; And merrily on the mossy banks there ran, Pelting each other with ripe fruits and flowers, Bright troops of naked nymphs and cupidons With golden bows; and o'er them in the air Floated glad butterflies and gleaming doves; And ever to the rippling of the river Rose melody of unseen voices, blown From the serene abysms far beneath; And other voices answer'd from the isles, And from the banks, and from the snow-white clouds That, flowing with the flowing of the stream, Trembled and changed, like shapes with lilied hands! Now one green island stretch'd across the stream, Paven with purple and with emerald, And walking there, all wondrous in white robes, Moved troops of virgins singing solemnly To lutes of amber and to harps of gold. Among them, resting on a flowery bank, Sat one like Bacchus, roses in his hair, His cheeks most pale with summer melancholy, Fondling a tigress that with sleepy eyes Nestled her mottled head into his palm. O'er head an eagle hover'd with his mate, And rising slow on great wind-winnowing wings Faded into the sunset, silently. Now gazing on these wondrous scenes methought: ‘This is enchantment, and these things I see Only the figures of an antique Joy, Unreal as shapes in an enchanter's glass And hollow as a pleasure snatch'd in sleep.’ Suddenly, strangely, answering my thought, And smiling with a strange excess of light, Murmur'd that God my Guide: ‘Fly from thy dream, And it shall last for ever; cherish it, And it shall wither in thy cherishing! These things are phantasies and images As thou and I are imaged phantasies; But if the primal joy of Earth is real, And if thou sharest deep that primal joy, These phantasies are real—not false, but true.’ Then did I cry, ‘If these fair shapes be true, No dream is false.’ And Eros answer'd me: ‘All things are true save Sin and Sin's despair, All lovely thoughts abide imperishable, Though countless generations pass and die!’ The wonder deepen'd. Earth and Heaven seem'd blent In one still rapture, for their beating hearts Were prest like breasts of lovers, close together; And in the love-embrace of Heaven and Earth, The river, ever-smiling, wound and wound; And as in beauteous galleries of Art Picture on picture swooneth past the sense, Marble with marble mingles mystically, Till all is one wild rapture of the eyes, E'en so that pageant on the river's banks Went drifting by to sound of shawms and songs. Bright isles with white nymphs cover'd; promontories Whereon immortal nakednesses lay Singing aloud and playing on amber lutes; Vistas of woodland, on whose shaven lawns The satyrs danced with swift alternate feet, Came, faded, changed; and ever far below In the dim under-heaven floated fair Those Spirits singing; and ever far above Those Spirits slight as flecks of whitest clouds Still singing floated; and the same still way The river floated did the heavens move on, Till all seem'd drawn in a swift drift of dream To some consummate wonder yet unseen. And now, the river narrowing once again, We stole 'neath forest umbrage which o'er-head Mingled outstretching arms from either bank, And woven in the green transparent roof Were glorious creepers like the lian-flower, And flowers that ran like many-colour'd snakes Turning and trembling from green bough to bough; And in the glowing river glass'd with speed This intertangled golden tracery Was mirror'd leaf by leaf and flower by flower, For ever changing and ever flitting past. Thus gliding, suddenly we floated forth Upon a broad lagoon as red as blood, Stainèd with sunset; and no creature stirr'd Upon or round the water, but on high A vulture hover'd dwindled to a speck; And on the shallow marge one silent Shape Hung like a leafless tree, with hoary head Dejected o'er the crimson pool beneath; And no man would have wist that dark Shape lived;— Till suddenly into the great lagoon The shallop sail'd, and the white swans that drew it Were crimson'd, oaring on through crimson pools And casting purple shadows. Then behold! That crimson light on him who drave the bark Fell as the shafts of sunset round a star, Encircling, touching, but suffusing not The shining silvern marble of his limbs; And that dark Shape that brooded o'er the stream Stirr'd, lifting up a face miraculous As of some lonely godhead! Cold as stone, Formlessly fair as some upheaven rock Behung with weary weeds and mosses dark, That face was; and the flashing of that face Was as the breaking of a sad sea-wave, Desolate, silent, on some lonely shore! Then Eros as he passed across the pool Upraised his shining head, and softly named Three times the name of ‘Pan;’ and that large Shape, His face upturning sadly to the light, Reveal'd the peace of two great awful eyes Made heavenly by the starlight of a smile; And as he smiled, the stillness of the place Was broken, and the notes of nightingales Fell soft as spray of roseleaves on the air, And once again the waters far beneath Were peopled, and the clouds moved on again In their slow drift of dream they knew not whither; But Eros swiftly pass'd and once again The brooding godhead, sinking in his place, Hung large and shadowy like a mighty tree Above the brightness of that still lagoon. And now methought that far away there rose Beautiful mountains stain'd with purple shades And pinnacled with peaks of glittering ice, And o'er the frosted crystal of the peaks The trembling splendour of the lover's star Shone like a sapphire. Thitherward now crept, Slowly, in bright and many-colour'd curves That river, hastening with a living will, With happy murmurs like a living thing; And soon it turn'd its soft and flowery steps Into the bosom of great woods that lay Under the mountains. Peaceful on its breast Shadows now fell, while still gnats humm'd, and flowers Closed up their leaves i' the dew; and thro' the leaves, With radiance faintly drawn as spiders' webs, Trembled the twilight of the lover's star. At last, against a mossy shore, thick strewn With violets dewy-eyed, the shallop paused, And Eros, wading to the grassy bank Under the shadow of the forest trees, Cried ‘Come!’—and silently I follow'd him Into the sunless silence of the woods. BOOK X. THE AMPHITHEATRE. And in my dream, which seem'd no dream at all, Methought I follow'd my celestial Guide From path to path, from emerald glade to glade; And ever as we went, methought the path Grew with the summer shadows silenter, While overhead from the great azure folds Began to stray the peaceful flocks of stars. Now I perceived before that Spirit's feet A light like moonlight running, and I heard, Far away, mystically, in my dream, The song of deep-embower'd nightingales. Along the woodland path on either side There glimmer'd marble hermæ crown'd with flowers, And 'mid the boughs hung many-colour'd lamps Like fruit of amber, crimson, purple, and gold. Last on mine ears there fell a sudden sound Like shepherds piping or like fountains falling, A sound that gather'd volume, and became As music of innumerable harps And lutes and muffled drums, and therewithal A heavy distant hum as of a crowd Of living men together gathering. Then did I mark that all the forest way Was thronging unaware with hooded shapes Who moved in the direction of that sound; Shadows they seem'd, yet living; and as they went They to each other spake in quick low tones And hurried their dark feet as if in haste. Tall in their midst shone that fair God my Guide, To whom I whisper'd as we stole along, ‘What Shapes are these?’ and ‘Pilgrims like thyself,’ The Spirit cried; ‘but hush, for we are nigh The midmost of the Shrine.’ Ev'n as he spake, Out of the shadow of the woods we stept, While on our ears the murmur of the crowd Grew to low thunder, as of waves that wash Silent, in darkness, up some ocean strand; And lo! we saw before us thick as waves Thousands that gather'd in their pilgrims' weeds Within a mighty Amphitheatre Hewn in a hollow of the grassy hills,— And faces like the foam-fleck'd sides of waves, Before some wind of wonder blowing there, Flash'd all one way and multitudinous Far as the eye could see or ears could hear, Watching a far-off curtain, on whose folds Two words in fire were written: ‘????. ??????.’ More vast that crowded Amphitheatre Than any hewn in olden time by man, And round it, and before it, and beyond That curtain, gather'd crags and monoliths All rising up to peaks of glittering snow And in a starry daylight darkening. Amid that murmur as of sullen seas Fair Eros moved, and of the shadowy throng Not one look'd round to gaze, while I and he Crept to a place, and finding seats of stone Rested, with eager crowds on either side; And then I heard a shadow at my back Murmur some question in an antique speech, And unto his another voice replied ‘????????’—then the murmur of that throng Was changed to quick sounds in the same sweet speech Spoken as music by my guide divine. But as I prick'd mine ears to list for more There came a solemn silence, and behold, Suddenly, to a sound of lutes and drums, The curtain dark descended. Far away, Upon a sward as green as emerald, There sat, with wine-gourd lying at his side, Wild poppies tangled in his hoary hair, Silenos,—at whose feet a naked nymph Lay prone with chin propt in her hollow'd hands Uplooking in his face and reading there Deep-wrinkled chronicles as soft as sleep; And overhead among the wild ravines, On patches of green emerald, leapt his goats, While far above the sunshine swept like wind Across the darkness of the untrodden peaks. To the low music of an unseen choir Silenos smiling spake, and as he spake The white goats leapt, the soft light stirr'd o'erhead, The white clouds wander'd through the peaceful blue. For of much peace he told, of golden fields, Of shepherds in dim dales Arcadian, Of gods that gather'd the still stars like sheep Dawn after dawn to shut them in their folds And every dawn did loose them once again, Of vintage and of fruitage, and of Love's Ripe kisses stolen in the reaping time. Sweet was his voice, and sweet that mimic scene— So sweet I could have look'd and heark'd for ever; And on that sight the throng was hungering, When suddenly the choral music ceased, And wearily up the mountains came a wight Clad like a pilgrim of an antique land. Tall was he, yet of human height, but there, Upon that mighty stage, he seemed as small As pixies be that play in beds of flowers; And him Silenos greeted, and those twain Sat on the grassy carpet flower-bestrewn; And then the stranger told a seaman's tale Of heroes sailing in their wingèd ships To flash on Troia like a locust-swarm, And among those he named his own fair name— Ulysses. Not as in the nether world, Within some bright and lamp-lit theatre, The drama calmly moves from scene to scene, And actors speak their measured cadences And make their exits and their entrances, Not thus did that colossal spectacle Flow on; but as a bright kaleidoscope Is shaken in the hand, and with no will Trembles, dissolves, in ever-wondrous change, The scenes upon that mighty stage did fade, While the deep voices of the unseen choir Were rising, falling, all within my dream. So, even as that grey-hair'd Marinere Spake with Silenos on the mountain side, All strangely vanish'd; and before our sight, To martial music blown through tubes of brass The Grecian phalanx brighten'd, and afar, Beyond the Grecian tents as white as snow, The towers of Ilium crumbling like a cloud Burnt brazen in the sunset. Suddenly The shining phalanx and the snow-white tents Shrunk up like leaves, and in their stead the earth Was strewn with brightness of a thousand flowers 'Mid which a great pavilion lily-white Bloom'd,—in its centre, seated like a queen, Helena! Oh, the wonder of that face, That miracle of lissome loveliness, That ripe red rose of womanhood supreme! More fair she seem'd, seen thus from far away, Than Cytherea rising from the sea Or seated naked on the lover's star Strewing the seas beneath her silvern feet With pearls and emeralds all a summer night! And from her body and from her breath there came Waft of rich odours that o'erpower'd the sense, And all around, strewn thick as fallen leaves, Were kings and warriors with dishevell'd hair Kissing her naked feet and with mad eyes Uplooking in her face! Then did I cry: ‘Oh happy Earth, where seed like this is sown, And grows to such a womanhood divine! Before the glory of that one fair face Gods die, gods fade, there is no god but Love!’ And turning, I beheld each face that gazed Was shining as anointed, for the throng Was drmking all the sight with rapturous eyes; But like a marble statue in his place Stood that pale god my guide—as stone to flesh His beauty that had seem'd so warm before Was to that woman's on the mimic stage, And ever on her face he fix'd his eyes With hunger of a pity infinite! There was a silence as of summer seas; The heart stood still, while brighter and more bright That glory grew,—till like a chrysolite, It dazzled all those upward-looking eyes: Then slowly, softly, silent as a cloud, Veiling that miracle of womanhood The curtain rose. There was a sultry pause, Such as there comes on summer days of calm, When every leaf doth seem to hold its breath And in the golden mirror of the pool The lily's shadow lies like alabaster. Each creature in that mighty company Half closing heavy eyelids, brooded o'er His own thick heart-beats; only Eros stood Calm, mute as marble, very fair and pale, Folding his arms, and on the curtain dark Reading his own sweet name! Again there came Vibrations of low music, strangely blown From out the very hollows of the earth; These quicken'd, trembl'd, till there wildly rose The shrieking sharp of flutes innumerable, To which once more, curling black folds to earth, The curtain fell. And lo! on that great stage Gleam'd Argos, and the statues of the gods Looming phantasmic in a blood-red moon, And Clytemnestra on the palace-roof Uplifting to dark heavens sown thick with stars A face fix'd white in one avenging spasm Of murderous pallor; and her stature seem'd Gigantic, on the high cothurnus raised; And not a feature of the woman changed, All kept one horror of the mask they wore, Yea, not until afar the bale-fire burn'd On Ida, did she speak, descending slow, And like low thunder, from the mask's thick tube, Her voice was wafted onward to mine ear. But as she spake that midnight air was cloven By such a shriek as only once on earth Was heard by mortal ears.—Cassandra wail'd! It seem'd as if in answer to that wail Chaos had come and all the graves of old Given up their dead; for suddenly the stage Was cover'd with gigantic shrouded shapes, Who stood and raised their hands to heaven and shriek'd! And in the dim, low light of blood-red stars Tower'd Agamemnon bleeding from his wounds; Iphigenia, like a spectre pale, Half kneeling, hands uplifted, at his feet; Orestes, with a dagger in his grip, Clutching the marble woman, while she shrieked: ‘Hold, child! strike not this bosom whence so oft With toothless gums thy mouth hath drunk the milk;’ Eleokles, with fratricidal knife; Œdipus groping for his daughter's hand, And white as any lamb that Virgin's self; And in the background, glaring with cold eyes, Dumb as a pack of lean and hungry wolves Full of blood-hunger, the Eumenides! A wind of horror o'er that gathering grew, And lo! I shiver'd like a rain-wash'd leaf, While from the throats of those pale spectres came Fierce supplications and anathemas On Zeus, and that pale skeleton that broods For ever at his footstool, Anarchy. ‘God! God!’ they shriek'd, and ever as they shriek'd They gnash'd their teeth and rent their luminous robes And wept anew. Meseem'd it was a sight Too much for human vision to endure! Suddenly, as a black cloud swallowing up Pale meteors of the midnight, once again Uprose the curtain. Then in a low voice, Still shuddering with that horror past, I spake: ‘Hear'st thou that cry, which from the dark beginning Pale souls, fate-stricken, have cast up at heaven? How shall these things have peace?’ and in mine ears 'Twas answer'd: ‘As the innumerable waves Sink after tempest to completest calm, For surcease of the mighty tumult pass'd, So these wild waifs of being grow subdued To subtle music of sublime despairs; For out of wrath comes love, and out of pain Dumb resignation brooding like a dove On sunless waters, and of unbelief Is born a faith more precious and divine Than e'er blind Ignorance with his mother's milk Suck'd smiling down! But, hark!’ and as he spake, There came a twittering as of birds on boughs, A music as of rain pattering on leaves; And to this murmur the great curtain fell, Revealing slopes of greenest emerald By shallow rivulets fed with flashing falls, And far away soft throbb'd the evening star, And everywhere across those pastures sweet Moved Lambs as white as snow! Then as I gazed I heard Apollo singing on the heights A shepherd's song divine, and as he sang Those lambs their faces to the light upturn'd, And each was human: a sweet woman's face, With large still heavenly eyes wherein there swam Dews of a dark desire; and lo, I knew The daughter of Colonos, golden-hair'd, Electra, still and pensive as a star, Alcestis pallid from the kiss of Death, The daughters of Danaos, and the seed Of Epaphos and Io; and, behold! Quietly through those mystical green meads Stole the fair Heifer's self, as white as snow, Star-vision'd, woman-faced, miraculous, Come after many wanderings to such peace As only Love's immortals ever know. Then down the mountain-sides, a tiger-skin Back from his shoulders blowing, lute in hand, As brown as any mortal mountaineer, Apollo, the glad Shepherd, hastening came, And cried, ‘Rejoice! rejoice! for Zeus is dead!’ And from a thousand throats those lambs did seem To bleat in human tones, while Io raised Her moon-like head and utter'd her sad heart In one rejoicing cry! Then did I turn My startled eyes on Eros questioning, And found his face like all those faces round Was shining as anointed, while his eyes Were fix'd on that great stage whence thrill'd a voice Which murmur'd on: ‘Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice! Now shall the sad flocks of Humanity At last find peace!’ In mine own heart of hearts I echoed ‘Peace!’ and that great company Breathed as a forest's multitudinous leaves Breathe balmily after rain; but suddenly That scene kaleidoscopic changed once more, Came then a thunder as of gathering clouds, Flashing of torrents down black mountain-sides, A storm, a troubled darkness, in whose midst A voice went crying aloud, ‘Zeus is!—Zeus reigns!’ And then, the darkness vanishing, behold! The scene show'd mountains to whose snowy peaks Fierce cataracts frozen in the act to fall Clung chained in ice,—and in the midst thereof Gigantic, silent in his agony, With all the still cold heaven above his head, Prometheus Purkaieus! Meseem'd he slept: His eyes were softly closèd, and he smiled Like one who sleeps yet dreams; and his white hair Had grown through long eternities of pain Down to his feet, clothing his limbs like wool, And the fierce wedge of adamant that pierced His breast and vitals was with countless years Rusted blood-red, and hoary all he seem'd As those ice-ribbèd peaks that hemm'd him round. Transfixèd were his mighty feet and hands, As when by Kratos and dark Bias nail'd To those hard rocks, and brightly yet he bled, For silently the fountains of his heart Distill'd their blood like dew! Sad was that sight, And yet I gazed upon it with sweet joy, For round the head of that great Sufferer, And on his face, and on his closèd lids, There brooded peace most absolute and power Sublimely self-subdued. Afar away Came voices of the Okeanides, Singing their sad primæval seabirds' song; And listening with quick spiritual ears, Methought I heard, faint as a sound in sleep, The murmur of these deep eternal seas Which wash for ever the weary feet of Earth. Then up those desolate heights, from ledge to ledge Of living granite, came a godlike shape, Gigantic, yet smooth-flesh'd and young of limb, With eagle-eye that faced the midday sun And shrank not, leading slowly (as one leads A wounded horse that falters with its pain) An aged Centaur,—man from brow to breast, Bearded and mighty-brow'd and venerable, But bodied like some grey and mighty steed; And lo, I knew the first was Herakles, The second Cheiron; and behold, this last Was faint thro' one green wound upon his breast, Deep, bloody, and he stagger'd as he came, And ofttimes fell upon his quivering knees And moan'd aloud, beating the solid rock With hoofs of iron into sparks of fire. Thereon, I turn'd to Eros questioning: ‘Why cometh Cheiron, led by Herakles?’ And Eros, on whose face there shone a light New and ecstatic as the rising moon, Answer'd: ‘Until another immortal god Contentedly shall take the cup of death, Taking his stand in that pale Sufferer's place, Prometheus must abide and drink his doom; But Cheiron, weary from his wound and weak, Elects to perish in that pale god's stead, And hither cometh led by Herakles, That so the prophecy may be fulfilled. And lo, amid the rocks of that ravine, Face unto face with that pale Sufferer, Uprose those twain, and slowly at the sound Prometheus woke, and shaking from his eyes Eternities of the white blinding hair, Gazed in their faces dumbly, even as one Who wakes confusedly and mingles still That which he sees and that which he hath dream'd. But Herakles cried loud with clarion-voice ‘Prometheus!’ and the Titan stared and smiled, Remembering; but as his woeful eyes Fell upon Cheiron's ghastly lineaments He trembled, moaning, Who is he that stands Beside thee, bleeding?’—and the god replied, ‘Cheiron the Centaur, come to take thy place, To wear thy chains, to suffer, and to die! Suddenly, for a moment, that strange scene Was blotted from the vision, and there rose A sound as if of many fountains leaping, Of many wild winds blowing, of many voices Uplifted in a troublous melody; And when the darkness melted and again That portent gather'd on the straining sight, The moon was out and stars serenely bright, And Herakles had freed Prometheus,— Who, standing awful in the moonlight gazed Around him with a sad and stony stare. And whiter now he seem'd than any snow, Clothed in the sorrow of his hoary hairs. Then, as his chains fell from him with a clang Of sullen iron, from afar away There came a cry, ‘Prometheus is free— Rejoice! Rejoice!’ and through those wild ravines From crag to crag, the weary echoes moan'd ‘Rejoice!’ but pallid still Prometheus stood Chattering his teeth, while slowly Herakles Led Cheiron to the rock of sacrifice, Lifting the chains. Even then the dark still air Was pierced by such a shriek as froze the blood, Shook reason on her throne and palsied will— A shriek of eldritch laughter; and, behold! There suddenly swarm'd in upon that stage Pigmies innumerable, dragging in A mighty Cross of blackest ebony! As swift as thought they set it in the chasm, Where for eternities of misery The Titan wail'd, and still they laugh'd aloud, That the deep chasms of the mountain rung. Then all the stars shrank up, and the pale moon Grew red and shrivell'd, but round Cheiron's brow Swam suddenly a luminous aureole! And, lo, his face seem'd changed, and it grew young, And, as it changed, his nether limbs of beast Swoon'd into limbs of white humanity,— And, lo, I knew him for that Man Divine Whose wan face gazeth from the cloudy Book With wistful eyes! Beneath the mighty Cross, Crouch'd like a lion couchant hoary hair'd, Prometheus waited, while invisible hands Raised up that other to his place of pain. Then did the laughter cease, as Herakles Transfix'd him thro' the shuddering hands and feet, When dropping chin upon his breast he moan'd, ‘My god, my god, hast thou forsaken me?’ Thrilled thro' the core of that great multitude A moan of deep insufferable woe! And I, with heavy hand upon my heart, Turn'd unto Eros; turning, saw him stand Transfigured—on his hands and on his feet Stigmata red and bloody—round his head An aureole such as that other wore; And on the Crucified he fix'd his eyes, And still the Crucified gazed down upon him, And each was as the image of the other! Two faces, far asunder, yet the same, Two faces, one upon that mighty stage, One in the midst of that vast multitude, Shone silent, and the moon was white on both! It was a sight too sad for mortal soul To look upon and live. I shriek'd and swoon'd, And dropt upon the earth as still as stone; While all that pageant and that multitude Pass'd into night as if they had not been! BOOK XI. THE VALLEY OF DEAD GODS. I woke: the night had fallen—the scene had changed— And living yet, I wander'd darkly on. Alone within a Valley lone as death, Alone tho' all around me shapes liek men Pass'd wailing, and their crying in mine ears Was as the waves of ocean when they wash On sunless arctic shores of rock and ice, I wander'd, and at every step I took The shadows of the night grew balefuller; Yet dimly I discern'd on every side Black mountains rising up to blacker skies, And hither and thither forkèd lights that flash'd O'er gulfs of dread new-riven; and me-thought The path I trode was strewn on every side With tombs of stone and marble sepulchres, Out of whose darkness look'd the sheeted dead, Moaning; and oft I paused in act to fall Into some open grave, and looking down Saw skulls and bleaching bones and snake-like ghosts That crawled among them. Then in soul's despair I call'd aloud on God, and all around Thunder like hideous laughter answer'd me, And from the throat of every open grave Came shrieks and ululation. Blacker yet The Valley grew, until in soul's despair I paused, and, looking upward, saw the heights Alive with pallid meteors, that like snakes Crawl'd on the ground, or rose like wan-eyed ghosts In glimmering shrouds, or plunged into the abyss And vanish'd; and the wailing all around Grew thick as clangour of waves that smite each other, Clash back, and smite again; and suddenly I saw a blood-red star aloft in heaven Shoot from its sphere, and fall, and after that Another and another, till all the air Was luminous and dreadful, sown with drops Of flame, like blood! Then, as I upward gazed, There came a shape in pilgrim's weeds like mine, Who touch'd my arm and mumbled in mine ear With voice that seemèd faint and far away: ‘They fall! they fall! as thick as leaves they fall, Unpeopling all the starry thrones of heaven. Rejoice! rejoice!’ And when I questioned him Of that strange Valley where I walk'd in dread, He answer'd, laughing feebly in his throat, ‘The Valley of the shadows of dead gods! Rejoice! rejoice! the gods are fallen, are fallen!’ Phantom he seem'd where all was phantom-like, Yet human. As he spoke, those open graves Echo'd his cheerless laugh, and the white stones Chatter'd like teeth, and from the heights a voice Answer'd, ‘Rejoice—the gods are fallen, are fallen!’ Then, pointing with his hand at that red rain Which ever fell from heaven, ‘Behold!’ he cried, ‘Another and another and another; Eternity has closed its gates upon them. Homeless they haunt the void, and fall, and fall!’ Then horror closed upon me like a hand Clutching mine entrails, while I wander'd on In darkness visible; and at my back That greybeard follow'd, wailing, ‘Fallen, fallen!’ And presently I saw a sheeted form, Who sat upon a sepulchre, and struck A harp of gold and sang: golden his hair, Above a thin face wasted into bone, And large regretful eyes; and lo! his limbs Within the open shroud were wasted not But beautiful as marble, and his arms As marble too; and round about him danced Wild ghosts of naked witches in a ring, Who sang, ‘Apollo! hail, all hail Apollo!’ Then tore their hair and fell upon the ground And shriek'd aloud; and overhead the clouds Were riven and sullen peals of thunder shook The empty thrones of heaven. Shuddering I pass'd And came unto a fiery space wherein Two forms were struggling in a fierce embrace— One bright and beautiful, one black as night And wingèd like an eagle; and around Monsters, like hideous idols wrought in stone, Yet living, hover'd, uttering shrieks and cries. And lo! the first, who wore a golden crown And robes of white and crimson like a king, O'ercame and would have slain the night-black foe But that he spread his great wings monster-wise And shrieking fled!—Pallid with victory, Yet ring'd around by frantic shapes of fear, The bright god stood a moment's space and held A dagger like the sacrificial knife Up skyward; from the wold wild voices wail'd His name, the Buddha, while a lightning-flash Illumed him head to foot in blinding flame, And underneath his feet the earth was riven, And lo! he bared his bosom white as snow, Sheathing the knife therein, and with a moan Fell prone upon his face,—while those fierce forms Crept nearer, hovering o'er him where he lay Like vultures hovering round a bleeding lamb! O night of wonder! Thro' that vale accurst I wander'd, struggling thro' strange seas of souls That thicken'd on my path like ocean-waves; And all the place was troubled and alive With dreadful simulacra of the gods And ghosts of men, and wheresoe'er I trode The earth was still torn open into graves. I saw, methought, on a dark mountain-side Legions of ghosts that surged and broke to foam Of waving banners and of hookèd swords Around a Sepulchre, wherein there sat One with black eyeballs and a beard of snow, Who smote his hands together and cried aloud, ‘Allah il allah!’—and the crowds around Echoed the name of Allah, and above The thunders answer'd Allah, while, behold! The heavens, blown open high above the peaks, Reveal'd in bloodiest mirage multitudes Of phantom armies, struggling, multiplying, Coming for ever, ever vanishing, With waving banners and with hookèd swords Like those who heard the voice and named the Name On that dark mountain-side! Then in my dream I saw the spirits of departed gods Sweep by like changing forms within the fires Of Ætna, when the forkèd tongues of flame Shoot skyward and the lava boils and foams Down the bright shuddering slopes; so thick and fast They came and went and changed; and I beheld Astarté, with her nude dishevell'd train Of women-worshippers who smote their breasts And wept and wail'd; Moloch and Baal, two shapes Inform and monstrous, follow'd by a throng Of kings in purple and of slaves in rags And Ethiops clashing cymbals; black-eyed Thor, Bearded and strong, stript naked to the waist, Girt round with eager cyclops while he swung His hammer near the furnace burning red In a black mountain cavern,—all his face Gleaming, his form illumed from head to foot With subterranean fires; Thammuz pale, Walking through glades of moonlight like a ghost; Lucifer, serpent-crested, clad in mail, Shaking his sword at heaven, and with his foot Set on a writhing dragon: and all I saw Vanished and came again, and vanishing Gave place to more,—chaos of gods and ghosts Confusedly appearing and departing; Every strange shape that Superstition weaves, That man or fiend hath fashioned: Gorgons dire, Chimæras, kobolds, witches, pixies, elves, Undines, and vampires,—intermix'd with these, Saints calendar'd and martyr'd; naked nuns Embraced by satyrs stoled and shaven-crown'd Goat-footed; sable-stoled astrologers, Waited upon by grinning apes and trolds And wizards waving wands: so that my soul Was sicken'd and my fever-thicken'd blood Paused in me and surcharged my fearful heart Until it ceased to beat: and as I fled Weeping, all faded like a tempest-cloud, And lonely in the night before my face I saw the form of the eternal Sphinx Dreadfully brooding with cold pitiless eyes Fix'd upon mine, and round it momently Sheet-lightning played, and 'tween its stony claws It held a woman's naked bleeding corpse From which the shroud had fallen, and from its throat There came a murmur like the whole world's moan, Thunder of doom and uttermost despair! Frozen to stone, I stood and gazed and gazed, Dead-eyed as that vast shape! The vision pass'd Like vapour from a mirror. Night again, With one black wing of tempest, blotted out That portent; and before my face I saw A pale god with a dove upon his wrist, Sitting upon a tomb and singing low Some strange sweet song of summer; then, with tears, He named the name of his fair brother Christ, And search'd the gloom with bright blue heavenly eyes, And listen'd for a coming; and methought I heard a sound of wailing, and, behold! Along the valley came three woman-forms Supporting One who seemèd sick and spent, A crown of thorns upon his bleeding brow, Blood-drops upon his piercèd feet and hands, And in his dexter hand a lanthorn-light That flicker'd in the wind; and as they came, These women wail'd aloud, ‘He hath arisen!’ And joyfully his blue-eyed brother rose To greet him coming, but shrank back beholding The thin grey hair, the worn and weary cheeks, The pale lacklustre orbs of him who came Unwitting whither,—wearied out and spent With centuries of sorrow and despair. But Balder cried, uplooking in his face, ‘O brother, hast thou risen?’ and that other, Moving his head feebly from side to side, And groping with his hands, moan'd, ‘Risen! risen!’ Like one who dying murmurs to himself Some echo from the weepers who surround His piteous bed of doom; and as he spake, His eyes grew dimmer, and his bearded chin Fell forward on his breast, and like a corpse He swung upheld by those wan women who wail'd ‘Rejoice! for Christ hath risen!’ Then methought, While Heaven and Hell moan'd answer to each other, And throngs of gods like wolves around a fire Gather'd, and earth as far as eye could see, Was one wild sea of open graves, that broke To foam of dead shapes shining in their shrouds, I heard a voice out of the darkness calling And weary voices answering as it sang:— Black is the night, but blacker my despair; The world is dark—I walk I know not where; Yet phantoms beckon still, and I pursue— Phantoms, still phantoms! there they loom—and there! Adonai! Lord! art thou a Phantom, too? One strikes—before the blow I bend full weak; One beckoning smiles, but fades in act to speak; One with a clammy touch doth chill me thro'— See! they join hands in circle, while I shriek, Adonai! Lord! art thou a Phantom, too? Dark and gigantic, one, with crimson hands Upstretch'd in protestation, frownign stands, While tears like blood his night-black cheeks bedew— He tears his hair, he sinks in shifting sands— Adonai! Lord! art thou a Phantom, too? The sad, the glad, the hideous, and the bright, The kings of darkness, and the lords of light, The shapes I loved, the forms whose wrath I flew, Now wail together in eternal night— Adonai! Lord! art thou a Phantom, too? Fall'n from their spheres, subdued and over-thrown, Yet living yet, they make their ceaseless moan, Where never grass waves green or skies are blue— Theirs is the realm of shades, the sunless zone, Where thou, O Master, weeping wanderest too! O Master, is it thou thy servant sees, Cast down and conquer'd, smitten to thy knees? Ah, woe! for thou wast fair when life was new— Adonai! Lord! and art thou even as these? A shape forlorn and lost, a Phantom too? Black is the night, but blacker my despair; The world is dark—I walk I know not where; Yet phantoms beckon still, and I pursue! Phantoms, still phantoms! there they loom—and there! Adonai! Lord! art thou a Phantom, too? And while the voices wail'd, I watch'd his face Who swung in anguish to and fro, upheld By those wan women; and the face was blank And bloodless, his eyes sightless, and his jaw Hung heavy as lead; and still the women cried ‘Rejoice! for He hath risen!’ but when at last The music of those voices died away, He slipt from their thin hands and with a spasm Shot forward on his face and lay as dead, Still as a stone, while all the mighty vale Was shaken as by earthquake, and afar The solid night-black heavens were riven as rocks, And thunder answer'd thunder! Then the waves Of darkness breaking on me like a sea Seem'd to o'erwhelm me, and I sank and sank Down, down to unknown depths of black despair Till sense and feeling fail'd me and me-thought The end of all was come; but when again Life flow'd within me, I was wandering still In that sad valley; and all forms and shapes Had vanish'd, and the place was sleeping calm Under a piteous moonlight. Overhead The ebon peaks touch'd the cold heavens, alive With stars like feeble specks of silver sand, And all the heavens and the sad space beneath Were silent as a sepulchre! Forlorn And broken-hearted, then I wander'd on, With tombs and open graves on either side, Weeping nor wailing, but subdued to calm Of weariest despair; and no thing stirr'd Around me, but full tide of silence fill'd The shoreless earth and heaven; when suddenly I saw before me, lying on the path, One like myself in dreary pilgrim's weeds, Fall'n prone upon his face; and stooping down, I turn'd his wan face upward to the light, And knew him,—Faith, my townsman, cold and dead! His blind eyes glazèd with the frosty film, Cold icicles in his white hair and beard, His right hand gripping still the empty leash Which once had held his beauteous snow-white hound, Now fled for ever to some sunless cave To wail in desolation. Then my force Fell from me, and my miserable eyes Shed tears like blood, and, broken utterly, I took the poor grey head between my knees, Making a pillow, and with gentle hand Smoothing the piteous hair, murmur'd aloud A sad song sung by women in our town While weaving long white raiment for the dead, When the corpse-candles burn and all the night Time throbs the minutes like a beating heart To those who weep and wait. And thus I sang:— Dead man, clammy cold and white, With thy twain hands clench'd so tight, With thy red heart and thy brain Silent in surcease of pain, Wherefore still in strange surprise Fix thine eyes? Glass'd to mirror some strange ray Gleaming ghostwise in the day, Staring silent, in amaze, Dead man, glimmereth thy gaze, Glazing through thy cold grey hair With sick stare. Not on men, and not on me, Not on aught the living see, Gazest thou—but still, alas! Thou perceivest something pass I perceive not, tho' its thrill Cometh chill. Dead man, dead man, take repose! Since thy twain eyes will not close, I will shut them softly over With the waxen lids for cover; Look no more upon the sun— All is done! And singing thus I knew (within my dream) That all the gods were dead, and Death was King, For all the woeful Valley once again Grew populous with silent ghostly shapes Tumultuously moving, like a sea; And gazing thro' my tears I saw, within The heart of that black valley, a Form that rose Gigantic, crag-like, frosted o'er and o'er With the cold crystals of eternity, Yet naked as a skeleton; and, lo! I knew the shape and lineaments of Death, Lord of the gods and chaos, first and last Of portents and of phantoms: huge he rose, Swarm'd on by that tumultuous tide of ghosts Which broke around his feet; and round him stretch'd The realm of tears and silence, and above him Heaven open'd,—an abyss of nothingness Far as Despair could see or hope could wing! BOOK XII. THE INCONCEIVABLE. Sadder than night, and sunless as the grave, Was that strange darkness clouding soul and sense; But when I saw the living light again, And felt the blood within me crawling cold As drops of quicksilver from vein to vein, I stood alone upon a wan wayside Watching the crimson eyeballs of the Dawn. Darnels and nettles gather'd bosom-deep Around a rain-worn Cross whereon there clung No shape of flesh or stone, but from beneath Came a white glimmer as of bleaching bones; And on the Cross a lonely raven sat Preening his ragged plumage silently; And all around were bare and leafless woods Through which the sunshafts straggled crimson red; And crouching in the shadow of the Cross Three spectral Women wrapt in ragged weeds Sat moaning; and of these the first was old, With hair as white as wool blown loose and wild Around her; and the second woman bare A lighter load of years, with jet-black hair Just touch'd with hoarfrost; but the third was young, With eyes of pallid speedwell-blue, and hair Pure golden raining round her ripe round arms And naked breasts. And unto these I spake, Remembering that beauteous god, my guide, And question'd them of Eros, if their eyes Had seen him pass that way along the woods Quitting the woeful Valley of dead gods? And one said: ‘He who suckled at my breast Is dead and cold, and walks the world no more;’ The second said: ‘The vineyard is destroyed; The Master of the vineyard sleeps for ever;’ And the third said: ‘He whom I loved, whose feet I wash'd and then anointed, at whose tomb I have knock'd aloud for countless weary years, Is dead, and hath not risen;’ and all the three Lifted their voices wailing piteously. Ev'n as I look'd and listen'd woe-begone I heard a voice behind me murmuring ‘Good morrow;’ and quickly turning I beheld A gentle wight, who wore around his form A pleasant woodland robe of grassy green, Brown shoon upon his feet, and in his hand Carried a staff enwound with ferns and flowers; And when I question'd ‘Who are these who weep?’ Upon those women wailing 'neath the cross He gazed in pity, not in pain like mine, And answer'd,— ‘Outcasts from the world. Poor leaves! Fall'n with the rain that beats upon a grave.’ THE PILGRIM. Methinks I know them. Yesternight I saw These shadows, 'mong the shadows of dead gods. THE MAN. Comest thou from thence? Well may thy cheek be pale, Thy look wayworn and desolate, thy soul Haunted and woeful. Hast thou wander'd far? THE PILGRIM. Yea, thither and hither, from Christopolis. THE MAN. And whither goest thou? From the dark-ness yonder, Surely to some new sunshine? Comfort, friend! The wailing of these wanderers cannot drown The music of the mountains and the streams, And scarce a stone's-throw from this piteous place The sunshine falls on crystal rivulets And warms the snowy fleece of leaping lambs! Clear was his voice, yet dreamy-toned and deep As is the wood-dove's cooing when it broods On its warm heartbeats; and his face, though grave, Was brown as ripen'd fruit and wore no shade Of fear or sorrow; and even as he spake The morning brighten'd, and from far away The silver clarion of the Spring was blown To wake the drowsy world. ‘Alas!’ I cried, ‘How shall the sunshine and the dawn avail, Since the sweet gods that made creation glad Are flown, and Eros, sweetest and most blest, Bends weeping o'er his Brethren slain and cold In yonder Valley of Divine Despair?’ THE MAN. Take comfort. Though the many pass away, The One abides; God bends o'er these dead gods, And smiles them into everlasting sleep. THE PILGRIM. Sleep? But they sleep not! Weary ghosts, they haunt That Valley, and the ears of weary men Can hear them wailing from the gates of Death; And lo, without their open sepulchres, In every land beneath the sun and stars, Women like these prolong and echo back The piteous ululation. Woe is me! Where shall I find a place on all the earth That is not haunted and disconsolate? THE MAN. Walk these green woods with me, and thou shalt hear The merry music of the waking world! THE PILGRIM. What is thy name, and wherefore dwelling here, So close to that dread Valley, canst thou keep A mien so peaceful and a voice so calm? THE MAN. Sylvan they name me, after some brave god Who found my mother sleeping in the shade, Naked and warm and drowsy from her bath In a great slumberous pool, and in his arms Clasp'd her before she woke and quicken'd in her A newer life, mine own; and when I lived And drank the light, she told me with a smile That she had never seen my father's face, Yet knew by many a sign of leaf and flower Some godhead had embraced her as she slept! THE PILGRIM. Didst thou not say but now, the gods were dead? SYLVAN. The gods of sorrow, but the gods of joy Ever abide where'er the woods are green And sunlight merry. Every flower and tree Shares light and life with them, and is divine. THE PILGRIM. A phantasy! With such a phantasy They sought to cheat me in the groves of Faun. SYLVAN. The many pass away, but Pan abides, And him we worship in these peaceful woods. Now, as he spake, those forms beneath the Cross Grew fainter, and their dreary voices ceased. Creeping from underneath with scented arms A honeysuckle and a rose-tree twined Their tendrils round the Cross, and over-spread it With tender bells and blooms; and as I gazed Meseem'd they lived and laugh'd to feel the life Sparkling within them, while their scented breath Perfumed the air I drew; while all around, As at the touch of a magician's wand, The woodland kindled into emerald flame, The grass along the sward ran bright and green, O'erhead the morning skies broke bright and blue, And the great sun became the golden heart Of the violet of heaven. And Sylvan said: ‘Yea, verily the many gods are dead, Yet that which was their life and quicken'd them Breaks into summer blossom o'er their graves.’ Whereon I answer'd, walking sadly on Beside him down the gladdening greenwood glade, ‘Christopolis remains, and in its core Death sits, a crimson King; and hither-ward, And yonder far as the wide gates of dawn, His sceptre rules both gods and thinking things As well as tree and flower; and high as heaven, He sets as sign of his sad sovereignty The empty Cross!’ But Sylvan, smiling, said: ‘Death is the servant of the One we serve, Whose breathing fills the world with light and fe.’ THE PILGRIM. Name me his name, that I may understand. SYLVAN. Nameless and formless is that Life Divine. THE PILGRIM. Hast thou not known him with thine eyes and ears? SYLVAN. He dwells for evermore but dimly guessed. THE PILGRIM. A riddle, like the riddle of the Cross! SYLVAN. A certitude, like thine own beating heart! The Ever-changing yet Unchangeable Haunts His creation as the breath within Thy body, and as the blood within thy veins: Moves in the mountains, fills the surging seas, Melts in the storm-cloud and becomes the dew That dims the lover's eyes. THE PILGRIM. Meseems I read Thine easy riddle. He thou worshipest Is shapeless as the blue ethereal air; Not God who builds a City for his own, But that blind force whereby all cities fall? SYLVAN. What he destroys he evermore renews,— As he renews the flowers and forest-trees. THE PILGRIM. Can he renew this desolate heart of dust Failing away within me as the seed That rots and falls away within the shell? Can he roll back the sun and summon back The boy who gladden'd in the morning time? Can he bring back the gods whom he has slain, Sweetest and best the god of flesh and blood For whom those three wan women weep and wail? SYLVAN. He can do more. With every dawn of day He recreates— THE PILGRIM. The mirage of a world! O peace, for he thou fondly worshipest Is not the God I seek, but him I fly. We wander'd on, and all around us grew Full sweetness of the summer. Green and glad The prospects brighten'd round us, and I saw Beyond the emerald reaches of the glade A leafy valley, meadows, groves, and streams, With fountains sparkling and upleaping lambs; And here and there a lonely human form Flitted across the sunlight and was gone; Yet for the rest the place was solitary And full of strange and solitary sounds— The wood-dove's brooding call, the whispering rill Half drown'd in rustling leaves, the lambkin's cry Distant and drowsy, and from time to time A far-off human call. Upon my heart Fell a warm heaviness and dreamy sense Of happiness fantastic and unreal When, looking back, I saw along the glade Those three wan Women slowly following In silence, and the pathway as they came Was sunless, dark and chill. ‘Alas!’ I said, ‘This valley where you dwell is haunted, too, By the dim ghosts of goddesses and gods;’ And as I spake we left the woods behind And came mong grassy slopes that wander'd on To pastoral mountains green and beautiful Crown'd by the golden noontide. Here I paused And pointing upward cried, ‘What land lies yonder?’ And Sylvan said, ‘A beauteous mountain land Of Shepherds; but at every height you climb The air grows chillier, till beneath your feet Crumble the stainless crystals of the snow. Be warn'd and fare no further. Rest content Here in the lap of summer, laden ever With roses of the dawn.’ And as he spake The sunlight brighten'd, and the leaping lambs Cried faintly, and the cuckoo called her name, Deep hidden in the sunlight's golden cage; And round my feet the warm grass crept like moss, Warm, green, and living, and the golden glades Kindled and blossom'd,—yet afar away Behind me still I saw those three wan Shapes Outlooking from the greenness of the woods. ‘Stay!’ cried he, as I faced the steep ascent And hasten'd heavenward; but, mine eager heart Fill'd with the summer as a cup with wine, Renew'd and strong, I left him standing there 'Mong those bright pastures; and as sings a lark For bliss of the glad beating of the wings That waft it upward, so methought my soul Ran over gladly, and 'twas thus I sang:— Hark, I am call'd away! Fain would my spirit stay, Here, where the cuckoos call, Here, where the fountains play From dawn to evenfall, Here, where the white flocks stray, With the blue sky spanning all! Here, where the world is May Fain would I rest, grow grey,— But nay, ah nay! Birds on the greenwood spray Flit through the green and the grey, Flocks on the green slopes cry, Softly the streams glance by, All things are merry and gay Under the morning sky: Sweet smiles the world to-day, Yet must I wander away? Ah yea, ah yea! A motion all things obey, A breath in the cloud and the clay, A stir in the fountain that springs, A sound in the bird that sings, From dawn to death of day Quick in the heart of things! All changes, and naught can stay; Blown like a breath o' the spray, I must away! Ah, would that I could stay! Yet, as those clouds obey Winds that behind them blow (See them, how soft, how slow, Thro' the still heavens they stray!), Onward I too must go! No space to pause, to pray, But heavenward, even as they, I must away! And now methought I came into that land Of pastoral mountains, with green summer cones, Forests of pine and fir upon their flanks, And waterfalls that flashing silver feet Leapt with wild laughter into dark ravines; A land of sheep and shepherds; o'er the slopes The snow-white flocks were spilt like broken streams, While faintly overhead against the blue Sounded a shepherd's horn. In sooth it seem'd A green, a peaceful, and a pleasant land! Climbing the shoulder of a sunlit hill, Oft gazing back on him I had left behind Dwindled by distance to a pigmy's size, I reach'd a solitary cottage door, And there a mountain maid with gentle eyes Gave me sweet welcome, placed me in the porch, And brought me mountain cheer—brown bread and milk. Around my seat flock'd children flaxen-hair'd, Brown men, barefooted maids, and wiseeyed dogs; And when I question'd of that peaceful land, And of the City throned in solitude Somewhere amid the silence of the hills, They look'd at one another wondering And could not understand. But one, a wight, Grey-hair'd yet lithe, in goatskin mantle clad, Said: ‘Master, I have wander'd, man and boy, These hills for seventy years, and seen no City, Save only cities in the sunset clouds Or in the mirage of the rainbow'd heights: Be warned by me,—turn back, or rest thee here; The crags are perilous without a guide.’ I answer'd: ‘God my Guide and Shepherd is; I need no other;’ and I took my staff, And bidding them farewell, I hastened on: And as I climb'd the hill look'd back once more And saw them cluster'd—children, men, and maids— Watching me as I wander'd up the heights. Then, faring onward towards the mountain-tops, I saw a herdboy like an antique Faun Sitting upon a knoll, and piping sweet, While round about him leapt his yeanling lambs And gentle mountain echoes answer'd him. Bare was his neck and brown, his cheek more red Than are the berries of the mountain ash, His hair like golden flax, his voice as clear As cuckoos crying round the lake-lilies That open'd on the mountain mere close by. Him for a little space I gazed upon, Then greeted with a smile, and question'd him, Singing my question from a merry heart, Till, smiling too and singing, he replied:— THE PILGRIM. Little Herdboy, sitting there, With the sunshine on thy hair, And thy flocks so white and still Spilt around thee on the hill, Tell me true, in thy sweet speech, Of the City I would reach. 'Tis a City of God's Light Most imperishably bright, And its gates are golden all,— And at dawn and evenfall They grow ruby-bright and blest To the east and to the west. Here, among the hills it lies, Like a lamb with lustrous eyes Lying at the Shepherd's feet; And the breath of it is sweet, As it rises from the sward To the nostrils of the Lord! Little Herdboy, tell me right, Hast thou seen it from thy height? For it lieth up this way, And at dawn or death of day Thou hast surely seen it shine With the light that is divine? THE LITTLE HERDBOY. Where the buttercups so sweet Dust with gold my naked feet, Where the grass grows green and long, Sit I here and sing my song, And the brown bird cries ‘Cuckoo’ Under skies for ever blue! Now and then, while I sing loud, Flits a little fleecy cloud, And uplooking I behold How it turns to rain of gold, Falling lightly, while around Comes the stir of its soft sound! Bright above and dim below Is the many-colour'd Bow; 'Tis the only light I mark, Till the mountain-tops grow dark, And uplooking I espy Shining glowworms in the sky; Then I hear the runlet's call, And the voice o' the waterfall Growing louder, and 'tis cold As I guide my flocks to fold; But no City, great or small, Have I ever seen at all! So, sighing deep, I pass'd upon my way, Not strengthen'd, but more spiritually calm Because the little herdboy's voice was sweet; And now my pathway by a streamlet ran, And in the midst upon a mossy stone Sat the white-breasted ouzel of the brook, Plunging with soft chirp ever and anon Into the crystal pool beneath her feet, And rising dripping dewily to her throne In the mid stream; and at the streamlet's brink A lamb stood drinking, and I saw beneath The stainless shadow broken tremulously 'Mid troubled shallows into flakes of snow. Then, journeying ever upward, I beheld The crags and rocks and air-hung precipices Redden in sunset, and above the peaks, Upon a bed of crimson duskly gleam'd The argent sickle of the beamless moon; And lo, the winds had fallen and curl'd themselves Like tired-out hounds in hollows of the hills, Restlessly sleeping but from time to time Audibly breathing; and deep stillness lay Upon the mountains and the darkening slopes Beneath their snows, and the low far-off moan Of torrents deepening that stillness came From the untrodden heights. Hung like a shield Midway between the valley and the peaks There lay a lone and melancholy mere; And in its glass the hills beheld themselves Misting the image with their vaporous breath. Hither, while yet the sunset lit the crags Mirror'd below tho' it had faded long From the dark hollows and the mere itself, I came, and sitting on its margin watch'd The faint light fade below me, softly changing From pink to crimson, and from crimson dark To darker purple, while one quiet star Crawl'd like a shining insect of the depths Upon the azure bottom of the mere. Ev'n as I sat and mused I heard a voice Behind me. Quickly turning I perceived A gray grave mortal like a mountaineer With crook and leathern shoon, his stature tall, His shoulders stooping, and his eyes cast down As if to read a book upon the ground; Who gently greeted me, and courteously, Like one mild-vestured in authority, Welcomed me to that solitary place. ‘What man art thou?’ I ask'd. ‘A friend,’ he said, ‘To all who cross this way on pilgrimage. My name is Peaceful, call'd by simple folk The Hermit of the Mere.’ ‘A lonely place,’ I answer'd; ‘lonely yet most beautiful! Its calm and loveliness are on thy brow, Its music in thy voice which sounds to me Soft as a fountain falling. Hast thou found Here, up among the hills, the Gate wherein The pearl which passeth understanding lies, And which for evermore with restless feet We world-worn pilgrims seek?’ Upon my face Fixing the untroubled splendour of his eyes ‘Be comforted,’ he said, ‘for thou hast reach'd Those heights where the Seraphic Shepherd guides The world's sad flocks to their eternal fold. Thou seekest God. His stainless Temple stands Among these mountains!’ THE PILGRIM. Dwelling here alone, Hast thou beheld Him with thy living eyes? PEACEFUL. I have beheld the flowers o' the earth and sky, The stately clouds that march and countermarch, The shining spheres; these evermore fulfil His ministrations; radiant is the light That covers up His face as with a veil; Soft is the shadow He in stooping casts Nightly to bless the still and sleeping world! THE PILGRIM. The God I seek is not so solitary; He hath built a City for His worshippers! PEACEFUL. Nay, friend; for he who seeks the living God Must seek Him in the gentle solitude. Here doth His presence brood in peace for ever Still as the silence on the mountain-tops; And he who findeth it, as I have found, Must leave the flocks of men, and dwell alone. Ev'n as he spake, and hush'd in awe I shrank As one that shrinks and dreads the sudden birth Of some miraculous divine event, There pass'd across the scene we gazed upon A mist like sudden breath: cloud follow'd cloud, And underneath the mountains and the mere Blacken'd, till utter darkness of the night Enwrapt us fold on fold; when, suddenly, Out of the vapour rolling down the peaks Red lightning came, before whose glaring spear The Thunder, like a wounded monster, crouch'd And shook with echoing groans! And with that change My spirit changed within me, from deep dread Back to familiar trouble and unrest; But as I stood and wonder'd hesitating, Methought that grave and gentle mountaineer Did lead me to the shelter of his hut Built by the lonely mere; and there we sat Together, while the tempest crash'd without And rain made leaden music on the roof; A flickering lamp of oil our only light, Which served to show the peace upon his face, The unrest on mine; when, marvelling much to mark His mien of gentleness and happiness, I brake the silence, thus:— ‘Aye me! methinks There is no resting-place or succour here Among these mountains! Needless 'twere to climb So high to find the calm and storm of God. But 'tis the promised City that I seek— A City of clear sunlight and sweet air, Not darkness, and a mystery, and a change, Fretting the spirit with primæval fear.’ ‘O friend,’ he answer'd, ‘I who speak have found Peace passing understanding in my home In this great solitude. What seek'st thou more? Is't not enough to feel for evermore The presence of the fair Artificer Who made the holy heavens and the earth And all within them? Can His living breath Not still thee, but thou criest for a sign?’ Thereon I rose, and striding to the door, Look'd forth into the night; and, lo, the storm Had pass'd away, leaving that mountain air The calmer for its coming—the blue void Was sown with stars like snowdrops; on the mere, Filmy with mist and moonlight, luminously Like living things their bright reflections stirr'd; And all the pathos and the peace of heaven Was pour'd upon the world in pensive beams. Then rising too the hermit join'd me there, And, looking upward with me, gently said: ‘Still is the night and peaceful once again, Have patience—so shalt thou, too, lie and bask Under the beams of God. Come in and rest; To-morrow, if thou wilt, fare forth again, But be my guest this night!’ He led me in, And on the hearth he strew'd a simple bed Of rushes dry and sweetly-soented fern, Whereon I sighing threw my wearied limbs, And for a time I toss'd in dark unrest, But slept at last; and when I open'd eyes The merry light was flooding all the place, And mountain, mere, and torrent were rejoicing In the new dawn of day. Then in the hut We twain broke bread together and join'd hands In fellowship of love; but when he sought To urge me to remain in that still land, A hermit like himself, I seized my staff And pointed to the mountain-tops that flash'd Their kindled peaks above us. ‘Yonder lies The path that I must follow, though it lead To utter darkness and to death,’ I cried. ‘Nor deem my soul ungrateful for this help Wherewith, most gentle and benign of friends, Thou hast sought to cheer my spectre-troubled way. But what thou dreamest I can never dream By these still waters; what thou dost behold I, haunted out of patience, out of peace, By that wild mirage of a heavenly City, I, faint from a dark Valley of dead gods, Behold not; what thou findest mirror'd brightly Within thee as within that gentle mere, Alas, I cannot find, being darken'd ever And clouded with a fear: wherefore our ways Part gently, and my lips must say farewell,’ ‘So be it,’ he answer'd. ‘As the bow was bent The dart must speed: pray Heaven thy soul at last May hit its lonely mark! But since thy path Is upward, I will guide thee for a space Through yonder desolate and dark ravines. High up among them, under shadowy crags, One who once wander'd in the sun with me, Nightshade by name, a lonely mountaineer, Hath of a rocky cavern made his home. He knows the loneliest summits and the heights Familiar with the morning, and perchance May help thy footsteps onward, where the peaks Grow steep and perilous!’ So side by side We wander'd on together till we pass'd From sunlight to the shadow of the hills; And as we went he spake in stately speech Of pleasures that made glad his hermitage— Of moonrise and the wonders of the mere, Of flowers and stars, white lambs, and lamb-like men; So that I linger'd listening to his words, And oftentimes glanced back with doubting eyes On the bright waters and his happy home. But now the clarion of the winds was blown From height to height, and far above our heads A sunbeam, springing godlike on a crag Stood tremulous, pausing between earth and heaven; And my feet hasten'd, and I felt once more The motion of the life within my veins Drifting with wind and light and mist and cloud. Dark was the way, my path a torrent's bed Dried up to spots of dusty quicksilver And strewn with fallen rocks: but eagerly I hasten'd, till at last my gentle guide Paused, pointing, and I saw beneath a rock One Nightshade sitting with lacklustre eyes Gazing upon the ground and counting thoughts Like one who telleth beads. And for a space He saw us not, though standing near his seat We watched him; but at last, like one that wakes Out of a heavy sleep, he turn'd his head, Saw us, and welcomed with a dreamful smile. Him Peaceful greeted, and deliver'd forth My name and errand,—when that other rose, Grasping my outstretch'd hand in both of his, And peer'd into my face like one that reads A dark and mystic book. ‘Pilgrim of God,’ He murmur'd, ‘welcome to these lonely crags Wherein, with mystic sounds of death and birth, The chaos of the Elemental stirs To Thought ineffable!’ Even as he spake He seem'd to fall again into a trance, Whereon the other gently smiling said, ‘Go with him! even as the swift izzard, Which safely walks the sword-edge of the cliffs, Or as some angel-led somnambulist Who falters not where waking men would fall, He knows the paths of peril.’ Then once more We two wrung hands and blessing one another Parted. And lightly downward Peaceful ran Until he left the shade of the ravine And stood in golden sunlight far away Uplooking, waved his hand, and from my sight Vanish'd for ever. Then to the other turning, I told him of my quest and soul's desire For certainty and peace; ‘But surely now,’ I added, ‘surely now the end is near, And I shall share the heavenly sight which fills Thy face with rapture of mysterious dream!’ He answer'd not, but, muttering to himself, Walk'd upward, choosing a dark path which seem'd To wander right into the stony heart Of those wild mountains: soon the riven rocks Rose o'er us, leaving only one blue space, A hand's breadth wide, to show the open heaven! And as one lying in an empty well May, though full daylight burns beyond it, see Stars circling in their orbits, I beheld On that blue patch of space above my head The gleam of constellations. Darker yet The pathway grew, and now on every side Gulfs yawn'd, abysses blacken'd, caverns deep Open'd into the hollow of the crags, And down the abysses cataracts leapt with hair Foam-white that flash'd behind them, and there came A sound and motion as of wings of birds Beating the darkness; so that unaware My head swam, and methought I should have fallen Into the precipices under us, But even as I totter'd Nightshade's hand Grasp'd and upheld me. ‘Courage!’ he exclaim'd, ‘And fear not; what thou dreadest is the abyss Of thought within thee! Follow fearlessly, And look not downward!’ Crag was piled on crag Above us, precipice on precipice Swam dizzily beneath us; but as one Who clings to a magician's robe, I gript My Guide, and walk'd in safety till we gain'd A place of caverns where like living ghosts Wild shadows came and went; and in the void Above those caverns lay an open space Night-black and scrawl'd with starry zodiac signs; And faint lights of the far-off universe Came, went, and came again, and in the void The tremulous pulses of the eternal Light Were visibly throbbing! Shuddering and afraid, I cried, ‘What realm is this? and who are these That are as living things and come and go?’ And Nightshade answer'd: ‘'Tis the peaceful realm Where with her crying children darkly dwells The midnight mother, Meditation: And what thou now dost see, or seem to see, Is the dim conflict of unconscious shapes In act to be!’ And as he spake he pass'd Into the shadow of a cave wherein There sat a creature shapen like a man But wan as any moonbeam; and me-thought Its face was misted with a vaporous veil Through which its eyes shone dimly, while its lips Moved to wild music, and 'twas thus it sang:— I am lifted on the wind Of a thought as fleet as fire, No foothold can I find, But the wings of my desire Beat the troubled air and gleam With the dripping dews of dream! I can hear the deep low thunder Of the strong wheels of the sun, I can see the green earth under, As a golden ball is spun, Rolling softly round and round To a sweet and showery sound. Life and Death unto my seeing Are as vapours roll'd afar, Through their folds the sea of Being, With God's secret like a star Shining o'er it, dark doth beat 'Neath the winds below my feet. I am trancèd into fear Of mine own swift-striking wings, For I hover darkly here, And the mystic cloud of things Swims around me, and my brain Trembles drenchèd with their rain. And I cannot pause to think, But my wings must beat and beat; If I pause for breath I sink To the Ocean at my feet— With the wings of my desire, On a wind as swift as fire, I must struggle; and my thought Gathers naught from my soul's sight— Only shadows star-enwrought, Death and Birth and Dawn and Night, And the soft ecstatic motion Of the Star above the Ocean. Could I pause a little space, Could I pause a space and listening, With that starlight on my face, See it glistening and glistening, I could comprehend full plain All the spirit seeks in vain. But the wind whereon I sail Is as terrible as fire, And I walk the winds, but fail With the wings of my desire, And I swoon and seem to sink On the mighty Ocean's brink. And the cold breath of that Ocean Lingers wildly in my hair, And that strange Star's rhythmic motion Soothes my passionate despair, And on that one Star I call, As I fall and fall and fall! The wild strain ceasing, from the caves and crags There came the cries of other piteous voices Blent in one murmur like the clangour cold Of numerous ocean waves; and as I paused In terror, watching those phantasmic shapes, One like a naked man pass'd by me shrieking And plunged to some black gulf that yawn'd beneath; And standing on the verge of the abyss Another, like the spirit of the torrent, Paused gazing upward with great sightless eyes, And pointed at the lights of heaven, and moan'd:— The Woof that I weave not Thou wearest and weavest, The Thought I conceive not Thou darkly conceivest; The wind and the rain, The night and the morrow, The rapture of pain Fading slowly to sorrow, The dream and the deed, The calm and the storm, The flower and the seed, Are thy Thought and thy Form. I die, yet depart not, I am bound, yet soar free, Thou art and thou art not, And ever shalt be! Ev'n as he spake there flash'd across the peaks A Spectre such as timid cragsmen see Flashing upon the Brocken overhead: So near, it lit the chasms and the peaks, So far, it seem'd a comet far away! Clear yet transparent, pale though phosphorescent, It stream'd across the darkness terribly, Fading and changing; now a formless thing, Trembling and meteoric, then, a space, Bright as a wingèd beast of burning gold; Then kindling into human lineaments, Wild locks, outstretching hands; and then again Melting to fiery vapour and departing Swift as a shooting star; and as it changed Those spirits from their caves peer'd out and wail'd, And splendour as of sunrise lit the crags And show'd the continents and seas beneath, The silver'd map of the dark sleeping world; And thunders from the heavens and earth beneath Clash'd loud together, and the face of night Was hidden, and from out the depths of life There came the moans of countless weary men. ‘Behold,’ cried Nightshade, lit from head to feet By that strange miracle of light, ‘Behold The Spectre of the Inconceivable! The Light that flaming on the shuddering sense Within us fades, but flash'd from soul to soul Illumes that infinite ocean of sad thought We sail and sail for ever and find no shore! The Dream, the Dream! The Light that is the Life Within us and without us, yet eludes Our guessing—fades and changes, and is gone!’ Ev'n as he spake the light illumining His form grew dimmer, and his face shone pale, The shadows deepen'd, and the stars again Lifted their silvern lids to gaze upon us, While like a meteor that strange Portent fled And darkness dwelt upon the lonely peaks. BOOK XIII. THE OPEN WAY. When I awaken'd, wakening still in dream, Methought that I was frail and bent with years, And on a road that wound through a green vale Slowly I trod, with pilgrim's staff and scrip, While far away o'er dimly lightening hills The rosy hand of Dawn closed softly o'er One fluttering moth-like star; and as the light Grew clearer, on a bank I sat me down To watch the coming day, and rest and must. ‘Another day’ (ev'n thus my musings ran) ‘Another coming of a dewy day After a night of pain! Once more above The radiant rose of heaven openeth, Petal by petal, glimmering in the dew; Once more the lark arises paramount; Once more the clouds move like a flock of sheep Shepherded by the gentle summer wind. The darkness is behind me, and I wake. The way winds fresh before me, and I live. O God! O Father! if indeed Thou art, O face beyond the Phantom! much I fear My feet fail, while Thy City yet is far! The world is green as ever, and the way Sweeter by reason of those perils past; Yet on my hair the snow falls, in mine eyes Thy dust is blown. Now I perceive full well I set my soul upon a life-long quest Which faileth if I pause before the end, And yet my strength fails and my feet are sore And surely I grow gray before my time. Now of my weary journey nought remains But babble of voices, glimmering of ghosts, Tumult of shadows, with an under-sense Of fair progressions moving to dim ends Across a sad and problem-haunted world. Much certes have I learn'd to make me wise, Little to make me glad; yet now I see The green earth dripping balmy from the bath Of orient, smiling; but my soul for smiles Is now too weary. Once my soul rejoiced To drink the breath of each new dawn, to feel The passion and the radiant power of life, But now 'tis otherwise. The mask of Nature Is beautiful—yea, far more beautiful Than aught that I have known in happy dreams, Yet seeing that I know it for a mask, I love it less; and through its sockets shine The Eyes behind, with portent horrible And dangerous expectation. Help me, Lord! For I am sick and weary of the way.’ O bright the morning came, as brightly shining Upon the trembling murtherer's raisèd hand As on the little clench'd hand of the babe Smiling in sleep! softly the white clouds sail'd, Edged with vermilion, to the east; the mists Rose like white altar-smoke from that green vale, The forests stirr'd with numerous leafy gleams, The birch unbound her shining hair, the oak Shone in his tawny mail, and from the wood The brook sprang laughing; and above the fields The lark rose, singing that same song it sang On Adam's nuptial morn! Fresh, fair, and green, Glisten'd that valley—only here and there A little fold of morning vapour clung To curtain yet some dewy mystery; But through these folds of mist peep'd shining spires, Fir tops as green as emerald, rookeries Loud with the cawing rooks. In the damp fields The mottled cattle gleam'd, while o'er the stile The shepherd, yawning with a fresh red face, Came ankle-deep in dew. Then I beheld The vale was populous, for here and there In straight lines upward through the dead still air The smoke of quaint and red-tiled hamlets rose, And mossy bridges arch'd like maidens-feet Spann'd still canals whereon, by stout steeds drawn, Moved broad boats piled with yellow scented hay, And soon my heart took cheer; and as I went, Half sad, half-merry to myself I sang This ditty of the sunshine and the dawn:— Pleasant blows the growing grain, Golden, scented with the rain: Pleasant soundeth the lark's song O'er the open way. Pleasant are the passing folk, Russet gown and crimson cloak, To and fro they pass along All the summer day. I can hear the church bells sound From the happy thorpes around; Men and maidens, old and young, Flock afield full gay. Sweet is sunshine on the lea, Sweet it is to hear and see, Sweet it were to join the throng, If my soul could stay! So sang I, hastening by the open road, And all my heart was quicken'd twenty-fold Because of brightness and a pleasant place; But even as I sang I overtook A wight who walking slowly seem'd to brood In potent meditation, downcast-eyed. And with no sign I would have pass'd him by, Scarce noting the calm brow and clear-cut cheeks, Had not the stranger raised his eyes and smiled Calm greeting such as fellow-scholars gave, Half absently, when pacing slow within The groves of Academe; whereat, indeed, My feet began to pause unconsciously, And my looks question'd of the pale cold face, The dreamless eyes, the calm unruffled brow,— For all was restless trouble in my soul, Yet these seem'd peaceful as a woodland well. Now, seeing my perplexity, once more The stranger smiled, saying: ‘Good morrow, sir,— A scholar, I presume? and by thy guise A dweller in some city by the sea? But wherefore in such haste?’ Then I replied: ‘Because the hunger and the thirst divine Consume me, and with sleepless feet I seek The City of the Lord.’ STRANGER. Nay, pardon me— What City, friend? and furthermore, what Lord? THE PILGRIM. The Lord of Light, whose name is Beautiful. Thou smilest. Is thy soul so desolate That it hath never heard the name of God? STRANGER. Not so. I know the names of God full well. But which god? There are many, I believe. THE PILGRIM. There is one God which made the heavens and earth, The air, the water, all that in them is. STRANGER. In sooth? Hast thou beheld Him with thine eyes? THE PILGRIM. Nay; none may look upon His face and live. STRANGER. Thou hast not seen Him yet thou sayest He is, He whom thou hast not seen? THE PILGRIM. I say again, No mortal may behold Him and endure. STRANGER. If thou hast not beheld Him for thyself, How knowest thou that? Upon what testimony? THE PILGRIM. Upon the testimony of His works— Yonder wide heaven, this green-hollow'd earth; His footprints on the rocks and on the sands; His finger-touch o' nights when I sleep sound (Yet start on being touch'd and waken up With empty arms!); His seal on dead men's graves; His signs, His portents, His solemnities. STRANGER. 'Tis strange; for I have search'd as close as thou, Deeper than most, aided by such wise lore As lieth in the circles of the schools— I have found naught, where thou hast found so much. THE PILGRIM. Dost thou deny Him? STRANGER. Nay, by Epicurus! Logician am I and philosopher: What, on the one side, cannot be affirm'd, Can never be denied, upon the other. THE PILGRIM. I will accost thee in a rounder way.— Canst thou keep calm, canst thou sleep sound o' nights, Indifferent whether there be God or no? STRANGER. And I will answer thee as roundly, friend. But first, permit me to disclose my name, My calling, and the business I pursue. I am a scholar, christen'd Lateral, Truth-speaker, dweller on the open way. Much have I read in books, and more in men, Far have I wander'd, deeply have I weigh'd The words and ways of pilgrims passing by; And much, I grant thee, they have blown abroad This rumour of a City and a God: Sometimes a City and a God; ofttimes A God without a City; but a God Invariably. Nay, in earlier days I was beguiled out of the open way To seek Him: in full daylight, diligently, I sought Him, and I sware I found Him not; Nor did I seek Him blindly, nor by night, But in full daylight, on the public road. I do not say, He is not; this I say: To me He is not, being thus unseen. And thou hast said, None may behold this God, Because the sight would wither up the eyes; But as I am a scholar, I affirm There is no sight of all that I have seen So dazzling that mine orbs endured it not. What can be seen is harmless to the eyes, Since what the eyes can see the eyes can bear.’ Thereon I mused (methought) with darken'd brow, Then said: ‘Dost thou know one Iconoclast? Meseems that thou hast learn'd his lessons well.’ But Lateral cried, with wave of his white hand, ‘I know the man thou meanest—know of him Much good, some ill—but they would stone him here, Where I walk free, upon the open way. He gibes at all things, I at no thing gibe, But measure all men's problems logically, Not mocking, but in truthful reverence.’ We twain, thus walking, wander'd side by side, And groups of men and women pass'd us by In silence, as on harvest labour bent, And many greeted Lateral by name. Then as the toilworn congregation grew, I ask'd ‘What folk are these who come and go?’ And Lateral in a low voice replied: ‘Friend, some of these are pilgrims like thyself Whom I most courteously have spoken with, Persuading them, whatever they believe, That labour near the open way is best; And lo! they leave the riddle of the gods And quench their sad desires in blessèd toil.’ Whereon I cried: ‘Hast thou search'd everywhere?’ And ‘Yea,’ said Lateral; when solemnly, With mine uplifted finger pointing back, I cried: ‘Raise now thine eyes to yonder peaks Of mountain crested with eternal snow— Hast thou sought there?’ And Lateral answer'd ‘Nay! I am a dalesman, no mad mountaineer, Nor do I deem a God, if God there be, Would hang his glory like an icicle Out of the common sunlight!’ ‘Raise thine eyes,’ I answer'd, in a whisper thick with awe; ‘Hast never, in the darkness, seen His feet Flash yonder, like the flashing of a star? Or 'midst the hush of a still frosty night Hast thou not seen Him from afar, swathed round With moonlight, lying like a corpse asleep Upon the silence of the untrodden peaks, With lights innumerable round His head Blowing blue i' the wind? or hast thou never mark'd A motion, the white waving of a hand?’ Then Lateral, discerning in mine eyes Who spake the tumult of a maniac pain, Gently replied: ‘I should have told thee, friend, I am close-vision'd: what I see full nigh, I see full clear, but these poor eyes of mine Have never reach'd to the cold realm of ghosts.’ Then did I laugh in scorn. ‘Blind human mole, Dull burrower in the darkness! not for thee God's glimmer, or the secret of the stars. I see in thee the sexton of the creeds— A cold and humourous knave, with never a guess Beyond his spade and the cold skull it strikes In digging his own grave. But fare thee well— Our paths part here.’ I spake, and on I ran, Leaving the pallid scholar far behind. And as I pass'd along the open way, I met on every side the drowsy stare Of bovine human faces, heard the hum Of hollow human voices; here and there From bushy thickets peep'd a peaceful spire, And oftentimes a church-bell rang, and folk Came thronging unto prayer. Then, slackening pace, Darkling I mused. ‘They toil, and pray together In intervals of toil; and yet meseems Their toil and prayer are cold mechanic things, Since on no face there lieth any light Of expectation, hope, or bright resolve. Happy they seem; and happy are the beasts They yoke for labour in the water'd meads; And with the reverent habit of the sense They soothe the solemn motions of the soul.’ And, looking round, on every side I sought Some pilgrim with a heaven-seeking face, But found none: only harvest-hoping eyes, And lips compress'd with thoughts of golden gain. At last, grown weary of the open way, I turn'd aside, prest through a quickset hedge, And over meads that rose to sunny slopes Began with careless idle feet to fare; But resting on my staff from time to time, Drawing deep breath, I watch'd the winding road Crowded with men and women of the vale. Sweet were the slopes I trod with grass and thyme And cool the clear air blew from bank to bank Of crowsfoot flowers; and as I went I cried: ‘O gladder this than is the open way, The common level road of tilth and toil— or men are foolish, weak, and miserable, azing straight downward like to blindest beasts, Yoked to the ploughshare and prick'd forward ever By base ignoble goads!’ Even as I spake, I saw, upon a green bank in the sun Beside a running brook, a curious wight Who lying on his belly half asleep Heard the brook gurgle in a gentle dream, Yet read or seem'd to read an open Book Set among scattered lilies on the grass. He, looking upward as I slowly came, Smiled like an infant or a heathen god Calm and complacent in its gilded niche, And nodded greeting supercilious With half-shut eyes; and him I gazed upon Awhile in silence, breathing from the ascent, Then question'd:— ‘Who art thou that liest here Close to the tumult of the open way, Lord of thyself and pitiful to scorn Of those who all around thee like to bees Throng in and out the hive! What man art thou, And what is that great Book which thou dost read?’ Then smiling softly, with the studied scorn Of perfect courtesy, the man replied: ‘I am a student, Microcos by name, Who, scorning babble and the popular voice, Dwell in the certainty of summer meads Scarce vex'd by fear of thunder; and in this Book— Observe it—old it is and worm-eaten— Writ in the common tongue and there-withal Dear to the common folk, I smiling read Strange, sweet, old tales of God.’ Thereon I said, Stretching mine arms out with a weary cry: ‘Thou art the man I seek, for surely thou Must know the magic that makes conscience clear And as with nard and frankincense anoints The sad worn feet of Woe. Unfold to me Thy knowledge and the knowledge of thy Book.’ But Microcos uplifted a white hand In protestation. ‘Friend,’ he said, ‘be calm. Dark on thy tired eyes lies dust of earth, And on thy tongue the echoes of the road Ring hollow yet. Mark me, the sweet blue sky Was ne'er yet mirror'd in a broken water! And for the blessèd knowledge thou dost seek Calm is the consecration! Sit awhile Beside me on the greensward by the brook, And mark the white clouds sailing overhead, The blue sky misted with its own soft breathing, Then while the brook sings and from yonder comes Subdued by distance the deep hum of men, Let us together read a little space The Legend of the Book.’ Methought I stretch'd My weary limbs upon the velvet sward, And watch'd the white clouds sailing over-head, The blue sky misted with its own soft breathing; Then listen'd to the murmur of the brook, And heard the cries of mortals faint as dream, While in a low voice Microcos intoned, With white forefinger on the stainèd page. But scarcely had he turn'd one fluttering leaf, When with a moan of wonder and of pain I leapt up, wildly crying: ‘Peace! O peace! 'Tis the same Legend I so oft have read— The same dark Legend that hath made men mad— No more, no more!’ MICROCOS. Now verily I perceive The ways of unbelief have darken'd thee. Sweet is the Book, read sweetly, in sweet weather. O listen, and thy soul will be at peace. THE PILGRIM. Peace! Who names peace? O man! the words thou readest Are as a whirlwind on a battle plain, And every letter on that printed page Is red as blood. How canst thou sit and smile, And 'mid that carnage of the stainèd leaves Sit as a dove that o'er its own voice broods Perch'd on the red mouth of a murther'd man? MICROCOS. Meseems the Book is very beautiful, Read in the light of Beauty, beautifully. It tells of God, who framed the heavens and earth, Who made Himself a sorrow and a sword, Who lash'd Euroclydon unto his grip, And 'mid the fiery smoke of sacrifice Sat as the Sphinx with cold eternal eyes Outlooking on his pallid worshippers. Nay, further, of that same strange God it tells Who clothed Himself with our humanity As with a garment, drank the running brook, And pass'd, a wan Shape waving feeble hands, Silently thro' the very gates of Death! THE PILGRIM. That God I seek! O if these things be true, Instruct me—let me look upon His face! Thou smilest. Read the riddle of thy smile. MICROCOS. I smile because thou comest fresh from paths Where Literal and Lateral (the drones!) Interpret the dry letter of the Book. I tell thee, friend (now hear and be at peace!), These things are phantasies and images As unsubstantial as the dream I dream Stretch'd here beside the babbling of the brook; Yet sweeter, being dream: yea, no less sweet Than moonlight, or the wonder of the flower, Or aught of beautiful or terrible That haunts the regions of the earth or air. THE PILGRIM. Where is this God? I care not by what name Ye know Him—Beautiful or Terrible? Where is this God? and is He God at all? MICROCOS. I have not seen Him, and I know Him not. THE PILGRIM. Dost thou believe He is? or dost thou read A fable, disbelieving that He is? For either all that Book is dust and lies Or else there was a Father and a Son— A cruel Father and an outcast Son— The story of whose tears on this sad earth Is there in words of wonder written down. But with a dreamy smile the wight replied: ‘These things I understand not; this I know— Sweet is the Book, read sweetly, in sweet weather. I prithee quit my sunshine!’ Thereupon He turn'd his back, and on his elbows leaning, Smiled and read on,—while with a bitter cry I left him, and ascended the green hill Close to whose feet he lay. Meseem'd I climbed Through verdurous ways for hours until I reach'd The grassy summit, there methought I found A man in ragged raiment all alone; And lo, his face was set as is a star In contemplation of some far-off thing Down in a valley underneath his feet. Nor when I near'd him did he turn or speak, But sadly gazed; and following his gaze Mine eyes saw nothing but afar away What seem'd a shining cloud I touch'd his arm And question'd: ‘What is that thou gazest on?’ And he replied, not looking in my face' ‘The City without God, where I was born.’ BOOK XIV. THE CITY WITHOUT GOD. Beauteous and young, yet bent as with the load Of weary years, pale as a wintry May When lingering frosts silver the path that leads To brightness of the flowering summer meads, Was he who spake: his locks of tender gold Sadden'd with gleams of grey, his great blue eyes Pallid and dim with melancholy light, His voice forlorn yet sweet; and by a chain He held a snow-white lamb that stood beside him And gently lick'd his thin transparent hand. I echoed him: ‘The City without God! Alas! what City?’ ‘Yonder,’ he replied, ‘Behold it gladdening in the light of day!’ So saying, he pointed downward, and behold! I saw the gleam of shining roofs and walls Below me on the plain; and fair they seem'd As any upbuilt by hands, and thitherward Ran divers ways with thronging crowds that seem'd, Seen from that hilltop, small as creeping ants. He stood as moveless as a marble man Down gazing, while I question'd: ‘Weary years I have sought the City of God and found it not. Who built this other underneath God's heaven?’ He answer'd, keeping still his misted eyes Fix'd on the vision: ‘They who built the City First laid the shadowy ghosts of all the gods, And, lastly, God the Father's; then they wrought Beneath the empty void and drain'd the marsh, And out of earth quarried the marble bones Of buried æons, and with blood and tears Cemented them together, and at last, Strange as a dream, the City of Man uprose.’ THE PILGRIM. How fair it seems! yea, even fairer far Than the proud City of Christopolis! And thither hasten crowds as eagerly As happy people making holiday! THE STRANGER. From every corner of the earth they throng, Hearing the joyful music of the bells Proclaiming that the reign of God is done! I woke to that same music long ago, Nor wonder'd, tho' mine ears had never heard The name of any God, nor knew of any, Save the great Spirit of Man; and when I ran A child along the golden streets, and saw The air alive with shining argosies, The ways all beautiful, the temples fill'd With sunshine and with music, I rejoiced As only children may; but presently, Ere yet I grew to the full height of man, There came a wight in pilgrim's weeds like thine Who told me of strange Cities far away Where God still reign'd, and of the woeful Valley Still haunted by the shadows of dead gods, And suddenly, out of a gate in heaven, A piteous Face Divine look'd down upon me And vanish'd; and from that dark hour I knew No gladness in the shining of the sun. His voice was as a cry upon a mountain Far off and faint, yet clear; and as he ended He turn'd his eyes upon me, dim with tears, Then said: ‘Retrace thy steps and hasten back! Better the woefulest cities thou hast seen Than yonder happy City of Despair!’ Whereat I cried: ‘Since in Christopolis No comfort dwells, but only (as I have seen) A blood-red crucifix upon a grave, And since my weary flight has ranged the world, Seeking in vain a City upbuilt by God, I will go down to yonder City of Man And therewithin find some calm place of rest; For they who built it up so bright and fair Must of all men be closest kin to gods In love, in wisdom, and in mastery.’ He answer'd: ‘Search the City if thou wilt, And I will guide thee thither; yet be warn'd,— No pilgrim God hath haunted out of hope Ever abides among those shining walls; For if they slay him not, or if he 'scapes Their melancholy prisons of the mad, He flies into the wastes beyond the City And nevermore returns.’ Then side by side We pass'd descending towards the open way Crowded with wayfarers; and as we went The splendour of the City dazzled me Like the great golden lilies of the dawn; And presently we reach'd the living river Which swept us onward till I saw full clear The marvel of the domes that man had built. Even as I paused in wonder, crying aloud: ‘Rejoice! for, lo, I have found at last a City More beauteous far than any built by gods!’ I turn'd to share my joy with that pale wight Who had led me thither, but his face and form Had vanish'd in the crowd surrounding me, And into those bright streets I pass'd alone. Thus wandering on I joyfully discern'd The white and shining walls, the flashing roofs, Of that great City; not so fair, meseem'd, As far-off splendours of Christopolis, Yet stately, calm, and beautiful indeed, With marble palaces in stately squares, Broad streets with glad green trees on either side, Bright gardens, leaping fountains, temples, fanes, Observatories lifted high in air Near to the sun and stars,—all beauty and grace Of earthly cities builded up by hands; No walls it had, nor gates of brass or stone, But mighty avenues on either side Where all might enter in; and as I went I pass'd the citizens in snowy robes Going and coming calmly in the sun. Brighter, and ever brighter, as I went Grew the full sunlight of the shining place And as I wander'd through the bright broad streets With leafy colonnades on either side, And saw the stately white-robed citizens, Peaceful and gentle, moving to and fro, And watch'd o'erhead the many-colour'd ships Wingèd like eagles sailing hither and thither, My sorrow lessen'd and my fears grew cold. For surely never City of the earth Was brighter and more fair!—Down every street A cooling rivulet ran, and in the squares Bright fountains sparkled; and where'er I walk'd The library, the gymnasium, and the bath Were open to the sun; virgins and youths Swung in the golden air like wingèd things, Or in the crystal waters plunged and swam, Or raced with oilèd limbs from goal to goal; And in the hush'd and shadowy libraries, Or in the galleries of painted art, Or in the dusk museum, neophytes Walk'd undisturb'd; and never sound of war, Clarion or trumpet, cry of Priest or King, Came to disturb the City's summer peace; And never a sick face made the sunlight sad, And never a blind face hunger'd for the light, And never a form that was not strong and fair Walk'd in the brightness of those golden streets. Then thought I, ‘Fairer at least and happier This City is than was Christopolis, For all that dwell herein are strong and free!’ And as I spake I saw afar away The reddening sunset and the approaching night; When, suddenly, ere the dark night could fall, Radiance like sunlight from a thousand lamps Flooded the bosom of the wondrous City And made it bright as dawn! Methought I sat Out in the brightness of a mighty square, And watch'd the light and airy argosies Quietly sailing 'gainst the shadow'd sky, Now rising, now descending, even as birds, With some fresh freight of men beneath their wings; But as I mused I heard a sudden roar As of a tide of life fast flowing thither, And soon a crowd of white-robed citizens Surged wildly round me, bearing in their midst That pallid wight whom I had mark'd at morn Leading his flower-deck'd lamb; and many hands Were reach'd unto him, to grasp or strike him down, And crying wildly to my side he ran And saying ‘Help me, brother!’ fell and knelt, Grasping my robe. Then, as the crowd swept down, I faced them, saying, ‘Stand back, and touch him not! Children of freedom, citizens of peace, Why are your spirits vex'd against this man?’ Then one, a reverend wight with beard like snow, Stepp'd from their ranks and answer'd: ‘Give him to us! He hath profaned our temples, and is mad.’ THE PILGRIM. What would ye with him? Back, and answer me! CITIZEN. Strange to this City must thou be indeed, Not knowing that its rulers, holy men, Endure not in the shrines or public ways The hideousness of disease or pestilence, Nor any sight of moral leprosy, Nor any form of spiritual taint Whereof men surely die. Give up the man; We shall not slay him, but deliver him To those who in our public hospitals Are the approved physicians of the soul. THE PILGRIM. Name me his madness ere I yield him up, And give me proof of his profanity. CITIZEN. The proof is simple. Throug our streets he walk'd Crying on some wild spectre of the brain, Yea, naming an old name of little meaning, The name of God, which (as our grand-dames tell) Was in the olden times of ignorance By nurses used to quiet children with; Moreover, having enter'd unperceived One of our holy Hospitals of Birth Wherein the wheat is winnow'd from the tare, The strong life from the weak, he straight-way raved And in the name of that same God blas-phemed! Then stooping down to him who clutch'd my robe, question'd saying, ‘Brother, are these things true?’ And like a man whose face is blanchèd still From some strange sight of horror infinite, He wail'd reply:— ‘Ah, God! it haunts me still! The darken'd hall, the devils stoled in black, The cries of little children newly born, And from the distant darness the low moans Of woeful mothers! Brother, stoop thy head And listen!—As they bare the sweet babes in, Methought they look'd like angels newly fallen, Tender as rose-leaves, from the hands of God; And some were strong, and drew great draughts of life, And these they spared; but some were weak and frail, Poor little waifs with sad dim heavenly eyes, And these, being tried with delicate instruments, Were straightway still'd, and quickly swept away Like useless leaves, for instant burial; And some were blind, and since they could not see, They threw them into darkness with the rest! Then, brother, looking on that piteous sight, Seeing the little children cast away, I hid my face, and call'd aloud on God!’ CITIZEN. You hear him. Yea, he raves! And such as he, In name of that effete and loathsome Christ Who made of this sweet world a lazar-house, Would swarm our streets with sick and halt and lame, And give our precious birthright to the blind! THE PILGRIM. Take heed, lest thou thyself blaspheme and rave! CITIZEN. How now? Dost thou defend and justify him? THE PILGRIM. Would 'twere as easy a task to justify Meters and measurers of the flesh and soul; For if these things he saith be true indeed 'Tis your archpriests who are surely mad, not he; For who, beholding any thing new-born, Be it fair or frail, happy or miserable, Shall say what soul may grow from such a seed? And who shall know but the infirmest flesh, Though dark and dumb as any chrysalis, May hold the strongest and the surest wings That ever rose to the clear air of heaven? Nay, who shall tell what light we cannot see Whose orbs see only earth and earthly things Steals through the darken'd casements of those eyes Whereon the Hand divine hath drawn a veil? CITIZEN. Beware to echo him and share his blame! THE PILGRIM. He cried to God, and God shall hear his cry! I join my voice to his and cry a curse On this your City, fouler far to God (If these sad things he saith be true indeed) Than Sodom, which He did destroy by fire. CITIZEN. Another madman! Brethren, grasp them both! THE PILGRIM. Yea, seize us and destroy us, since ye slay The little crying helpless seed of Him Who in His pity made Himself a Child! O God, Who made the lambkin and the babe, And fill'd the great heart of the martyr'd babe With human dews of love and gentleness, So that He grew the help and friend of man— O God, whose smile was for the sick and sad, The halt, the lame, the wretched, and the blind, Put out Thy hand to help Thy little ones, And gnaw to death with Thine avenging worms This Herod of the Cities in its pride! Ev'n as I spake, with frantic prayers and cries, Clasping that hunted brother in my arms, They swept upon us and despite our shrieks Tore us asunder, trampled under foot The flower-fed lamb that gentle wanderer led, And swept me cruelly I knew not whither. Struggling amidst their throng, methought I swoon'd; And when I open'd startled eyes once more Methought that I was lying chain'd and bound Within some lonely madhouse of the City! How strange it seem'd that, ere my sense grew clear, My eyesight ready to distinguish shapes, I lay and listen'd to an old sweet hymn Sung o'er my cradle when a little child! And then I heard a sound like murmur'd prayer, And louder singing as of angel-choirs. Then, looking round, I saw that I was lying Within a large and dimly-lighted hall, And all around were human shapes like mine— Women and men, some chain'd as I was chain'd And others moving ghostlike to and fro; And from the throats of some of these there came The murmur I had heard of hymn and prayer. Gentle they seem'd, save one or two who shriek'd, Gnash'd teeth, or tore their hair, crying aloud Upon the God of Thunder. Some stood rapt Their eyes on some strange vision and their arms Wildly outreaching; others knelt at prayer; A few moved to and fro, with eyes cast down, Musing and pale; and many told their beads. Bare was the place—no picture hanging there, Or any fair device to please the gaze; But on the whitewash'd wall the mad folks' hands Had written strange old names—of God the Lord, Christ Jesus, Mary Mother, and the Saints; And crouching in a corner one poor soul, Dreaming aloud and muttering to himself, Had drawn in charcoal Death the Skeleton, Buddha as black as night but radiant-wing'd, And Christ with hanging head, upon His Cross. Wondering and pitying I gazed around Seeking some friendly face; and I beheld, Standing close by me in a saffron robe, A maiden like Madonna heavenly-eyed, Her white hands folded meekly on her breast, Praying and looking upward in a dream. To her I spake, demanding reverently What place it was wherein I prison'd lay, And who my weary fellow-sufferers were That in that dreary building flock'd together? ‘Dear brother,’ she replied, ‘this is the place Wherein those weary wights who are mad past cure Are prison'd from the sunshine and sweet air; All here are pilgrims like thyself, who seek God and God's City, with assurance sweet Of life immortal and eternal peace.’ THE PILGRIM. Then these are mad folk, and I, too, am mad? And yet meseems, though some are sad and wild, Many are smiling, bright and well-content. THE MAIDEN. Because each night, when all the doors are closed, Fair angels fresh from heaven enter here; Yea, even Christ the Lord doth often come To comfort them in their extremity. I gazed upon her wondering, and methought Her azure eyes were strange and sweetly wild, And patiently her bosom rose and fell With some disturbing rapture of the soul; Wherefore I cried:— ‘Alas! they are mad indeed! Since they behold what is not, and perceive That Phantom Christ whose other name is Death!’ THE MAIDEN. Nay, they behold the eternal Light and Life, Whose earthly name is Christ the Crucified! THE PILGRIM. Yet tell me, wherefore are they prison'd here? THE MAIDEN. Because the rulers of the City hold That they are lepers, who, being suffer'd forth, And speaking with the people in the streets, Would spread their souls' disease a hundred-fold. If any man doth breathe the Name Divine, Or seeing strange visions tell what he hath seen, Or speak of lands of dream beyond the grave, Straightway they lead him here, to these dark halls, For inquisition. Even as she spake The inquisitors appear'd, grave men and old Array'd in solemn black, and usher'd in By ceremonious guardians of the place; But, save myself, methought, none heeded them, All those pale prisoners being intent in prayer, Or singing aloud, or trancèd into dream. Then one, a keeper of the prison, led The inquisitors to the corner where I lay, And touching me upon the shoulder cried ‘Stand up! and hearken!’—and still chain'd I rose And faced them, while with calm and pitying eyes They coldly read my face for testimony. Then one said, smiling, ‘Fear not! since we come To heal thee, not to harm thee, if perchance Thy grievous malady admits a cure. Thou art one of those who darkening in a dream See visions, and beyond these clouds of Time Some phantom City builded upon air?’ Then I, forewarn'd and cunning to escape, Smiled also: ‘So they said who left me here; And peradventure, when I first set forth On the sad pilgrimage which brought me hither, I saw such phantoms, dream'd such dreams, and raved; But now, alas! the euphrasy of pain Hath purged mine eyes of that ancestral rheum, And what my soul once saw I see no more.’ ‘How now?’ I heard them mutter among themselves, ‘The man perchance is saner then we thought.’ And looking in my face, another said, ‘Be sure, if thou art heal'd of thy disease Thou shalt escape these chains and wander free. Now answer!—What is highest of living things?’ THE PILGRIM. Man; since he is the chief and lord of all. INQUISITOR. Whence comes he? whither goes he? THE PILGRIM. Out of dust He cometh, and full soon to dust returns. INQUISITOR. When Death hath broken the light vase of life, What then remaineth? THE PILGRIM. Ashes in an urn. INQUISITOR. Think! When the body is dust, doth naught survive? THE PILGRIM. Those thoughts which are the heirloom of us all, The Spirit of Man which lives though men pass by. INQUISITOR. Look round upon these souls which share thy prison— What are they? THE PILGRIM. Madmen. INQUISITOR. Yea; but wherefore mad? THE PILGRIM. Because they see a Shadow on the world, Namely, the Shadow of Death, and call it God; Because their prayers like fountains flash at heaven And fall unanswer'd back upon the ground; Because they, travelling in a desert place, Behold the mirage of a City of Dream! Then I perceived they look'd at one another, Smiling well pleased, and presently they said: ‘The man is surely harmless—let him go!’ And straightway I was free; but as I moved In act to leave the place, the mad folk throng'd Around me, crying the name of God aloud, Rebuking and upbraiding; and one, the maid With whom I first had spoken, moan'd in mine ear, ‘God help thee! Since thou hast denied thy God, Who now shall be thy succour and thy stay?’ As sick of soul and shamed I crept away, I heard behind me from the madhouse walls The murmur of a fountain of strong prayer, Voices that sang, ‘Hosannah to the Lord! He hath built His City, and He calls us thither!’ And once again it seem'd the cradle-hymn That I had heard when I was lying a babe Fresh from the shores of some celestial sea; Wherefore my eyes grew dim with piteous tears, And bowing down my head, I sobb'd aloud But bright as Hesper in the morning beams The City sparkled—square and street and mart Busy and merry, throng'd with white-robed crowds, The blue air bright with happy argosies, The water full of swimmers swift and nude, The fountains leaping, and the hearts of all Leaping in unison, while from countless choirs A merry music rang! But all my soul Was weary of gladness, and I long'd, me-thought, To be alone with God; and seeing pass One whose grave eyes seem'd sadder than the rest, I touch'd him on the arm and said unto him, ‘Prithee, are there no Temples in this City, Wherein a soul worn out on pilgrimage May rest a space and pray?’ and he replied, ‘Yea, truly—there are many—and yonder stands One of our fairest’—pointing as he spake; And I beheld a mighty edifice, Its dome of azure enwrought with golden signs, Stars, constellations, jewell'd galaxies, And changeful symbols of the zodiac; Over the columns of the portico A frieze in marble—strong Asclepios Pictured Apollo-like in godlike strength, Dispensing herbs and healing crowds of sick,— ?? ????????? ??? ?? ??????????, Written in golden letters underneath. I climb'd the marble steps, and pushing back The curtain on the threshold, enter'd in; And in an instant, as one quits the sun And steals 'mid umbrage where the light is strain'd Thro' blood-red blooms and alabaster leaves, I found myself alone in solemn shades. Facing me to the eastward, whence the day Crept thro' a stainèd window (figuring The Sun himself burning with golden beams And lighting globes of green and amethyst), A solemn Altar, upon which there stood The golden image of a sleeping Child, And bending o'er the cradle where he lay A Skeleton of silver, ruby-eyed; And round the solemn place, to left and right, Were many-colour'd windows limn'd where-on Instead of saints were wise men of the earth— Physicians azure-robed, astronomers With stars for crowns, pale bards in singing robes, And women like the sibyl, book in hand. From some mysterious heart of this fair shrine A solemn organ music slowly throbb'd, With deep pulsations, like the sound o' the sea. Then spirit-broken, awed and wondering, I cast myself upon my face and pray'd; And while I lay, methought, an unseen choir Sang of primæval darkness suddenly Struck by the golden ploughshare of the sun, Of kindling azure fields where softly fell The nebulous seeds that blossom'd into worlds, Of dark transfigurations changing slowly From rock to flower, from flower to things of life, And through the mystic scale, from beasts to man; And lo! meseem'd a darkness and despair, O'ermastering, awe-compelling, creeping down Like clouds that blacken from the mountain-peaks And shroud the peaceful valleys, stole upon me, And swathed my soul in dread before I knew, So that I could not pray, nor knew indeed What spirit to pray to or what god to praise, For all I felt within and over me Was some blind sense of demiurgic doom Feeling with strange progressions up to life, Then breaking, as a wave that breaks and goes! Then cried I: ‘Spirit of Man, if spirit thou art That in this Temple broodest like a cloud, Blind Spirit of Doom and Mystery and Change, How shall I apprehend thee? Wrap thyself In humble raiment of some awful god, And I shall know thee; clothe thy ghost divine In piteous limbs of white humanity, Speak with a human whisper in mine ear, And rest thy human hand upon my hair, And I shall feel thy touch, and worship thee; Come down, O God! if thou art quick not dead, And walk as other gods have walk'd the world With tread that thunders or with feet that bleed, That I may feel thee pass and bow to thee— For who shall worship darkness deep as death, And silence still as stone, and dreariest dread, Faceless and eyeless, formless, without bound?’ Thus praying, I was startled by a voice, Angry though feeble, crying in mine ear, ‘Arise! profane not with a foolish cry This Temple of the Law!’ and looking up, I saw a woman very grey and old Leaning upon a staff and gazing at me: Her robe all black and wrought with starry signs Like those upon the Temple's azure dome, Her hair as white as wool, her wrinkled face As blank and ashen-grey as is the Sphinx; So strange and sinister her look, she seem'd One of the fabled Mothers who for ever Intone Cimmerian runes of death and birth. ‘What woman art thou?’ I cried, and she replied, ‘A Virgin of the Temple; one whose task 'Tis to preserve the altar clean and pure, And sweep the floor of dust. I heard thee praying And came to warn thee hence; for prayers like thine Offend the solemn Spirit of the place.’ THE PILGRIM. Name me that Spirit, and I will pray to Him! THE WOMAN. Alack! no tongue hath named him, and no eye Hath seen, no mortal known, the Unknow-able; But if thou needst must pray, give prayers to those Who are pictured on the windows and the walls— The blessèd men who by their thoughts and deeds Have builded up this Temple of the Law. THE PILGRIM. Men that have perish'd! why should I pray to those, Seeing I famish for the Imperishable? THE WOMAN. Aye me! the foolish hunger and the thirst Of babes who sit before the laden board And crave for fabled meat and drink of gods! Take heed; for in a little while thine eyes Shall close from seeing, and thy throat and cars Be fill'd with dust. Death is the one thing sure, And Death is here, the Shadow in the shrine! Yet Death is but the shadow of a change, Since naught that is departs, tho' all things die! THE PILGRIM. Thy words are dark as night. What meanest thou? THE WOMAN. Lives pass. The Spirit of Life alone survives. THE PILGRIM. Yea, and survives for ever, being God. THE WOMAN. There is no God, but only Death and Change. THE PILGRIM. Read me thy riddle, Mother Sibylline! THE WOMAN. The Darkness that for ever gathers here, And in the heavens, and in the heart of man, Is elemental; 'tis the primal force For ever quickening into life and change, For ever failing in a thousand forms, And falling back to feed the central Heart That throbs for ever thro' the flaming worlds. Spark of that Heart, that heliocentric flame, Art thou, who, being kindled for a moment, Shalt vanish as a spark blown from a forge! THE PILGRIM. Aye me!—only a spark, to flash and fade! THE WOMAN. Nay, less!—this earth is but a flake of fire, Fallen from the nearest of those flaming suns Which burn a space and then like lesser lives In their due season blacken and grow cold. Think on thy littleness, thy feebleness, And praise the mystic, all-pervading Law, Which on the eyelids of unnumber'd worlds Sheds the ephemeral life, the dust of Time. THE PILGRIM. Alas! how should I praise the Invisible, Which shows me baser than the dust indeed? The empty Void shall never have my prayer, But that which lifts me up and gives me wings, And proves me more than any unconscious world However luminous and beautiful,— That will I worship. Fairer far, methinks, The meanest, smallest, tutelary god That ever gave men gifts of fruit and flowers, The frailest spirit of human fantasy Blessing the worshipper with kindly hands, Than this dead Terror of the Inevitable, Weighing like leaden Death, with Death's despair, In the core of countless worlds! I ask for God, For Light, not Darkness, and for Life, not Death; Not for the fatal doom which leaves me low— Nay, for the gentle, upward-urging Hand Which lifts me on to immortality! So saying, I left her standing sadly there, And quitting that proud Temple fled again Into the common sunlight; but my soul Was sad as night and darken'd with a doubt, And in my veins the ominous sense of doom Was creeping like some cold and fatal drug; So that the City with its thousand lights Seem'd like a feeble taper flickering In chilly winds of death, and all the throng Moths hovering round a melancholy flame. Faint was my spirit as a sickly light Held in the night and shielded by thin hands From the strong wintry wind, when presently I mark'd another temple marble-wrought, And seeing that the doors were open wide Enter'd, and passed thro' echoing corridors, And found myself within its inmost core. And in a lofty hall, with marble paven, One stood before a table wrought of stone And strewn with phials, knives, and instruments Of sharpest steel; before him, ranged in rows, On benches forming a great semi-moon, His audience throng'd, all hungry ears and eyes. The man was stript to the elbow, both his hands Were stain'd and bloody; and in the right he held A scalpel dripping blood; beneath him lay, Fasten'd upon the board, while from its heart Flowed the last throbbing stream of gentle life, A cony as white as snow. In cages near Were other victims—cony and cat and ape, Lambkins but newly yean'd, and fluttering doves Which preen'd their wings and coo'd their summer cry. The hall was darken'd from the sun, but lit By lamps electric that around them shed Insufferable brightness clear as day. Presently at the door there enter'd one Who by a chain did lead a gentle hound Which scenting new-shed blood drew back in dread Whereon from all the benches rose a cry Of cruel laughter; and the lecturer smiled, And wiping then his blood-stain'd instrument And casting down the cony scarcely dead, Prepared the altar for fresh sacrifice. The hound drew back and struggled with the chain In act to fly, but roughly dragged and driven He reach'd the lecturer's feet and there lay down, Panting and looking up with pleading eyes; The lecturer smiled again and patted him, When lo! the victim lick'd the bloody hand, Pleading for kindness and for pity still. Then in my dream methought I heard a voice Ring clearly and coldly as a churchyard bell, Saying, ‘Lo! our next subject, friends—a hound, Chosen in preference even to the ape, Because the convolutions of his brain Are likest to the highest, even Man's!’ Suddenly in my vision I perceived The victim's face, though hairy and hound-like still, Was now mysteriously humanised Into the likeness of a naked Faun, Who pricking hairy ears and rolling eyes Shriek'd with a sylvan cry! and at the sound There came from all the cages round about A murmur such as in the leafy woods Comes rippling from the merry flocks of Pan; Yea, I beheld them—cony and cat and ape, And lo! the tamest and the feeblest there Had ta'en the pretty pleading human looks Of naiad babes and tiny freckled fauns, Sweet elves and pigmy centaurs of the woods! And when the victim moan'd, they answer'd him With pitying babble of the unconscious groves, Cries of the haunted forest, and such shrieks As the pale dryad prison'd in the tree Yields when the woodman stabs her milky bark; And mingled with such piteous woodland sounds There came a gentle bleating as of lambs, Blent with another and a stranger sound, Faint, as of infants crying for the breast! This pass'd; for all my soul, being sick and sad, Grew blinded with the fastly-flowing tears; Yet straining once again my troubled sense I saw the faun strapt down upon the board, And though his feet were beast-like, his twain hands Were human, and his fingers clutch'd the knife! He shriek'd; I shriek'd in answer; and, behold, His head turn'd softly, and his eyes sought mine. Then, lo! a miracle—face, form, and limbs, Changed on the instant—neither hound nor faun Lay there awaiting the tormentor's knife, But One, a living form as white as wax, Stigmata on His feet and on His hands, And on His face, still shining as a star, The beauty of Eros and the pain of Christ! I knew Him, but none other mortal knew, Though every tiny faun and god o' the wood, Still garrulously babbling, named the Name; And looking up into the torturer's face He wept and murmur'd, ‘Even as ye use The very meanest of My little ones, So use ye Me!’ That other smiled and paused— He only heard the moaning of a hound— Then crushing one hand on the murmuring mouth, He with the other took the glittering knife, And leisurely began! I look'd no more; But covering up mine eyes I shriek'd aloud And rush'd in horror from the accursèd place; But at the door I turn'd, and turning met The piteous eyeballs fix'd in agony Beneath a forehead by the knife laid bare! ‘Almighty God,’ I cried, ‘behold Thy Son!’ And pointed at the victim. As I spake, A throng of frowning men surrounded me, Crying, ‘Who raves? down with him! drive him forth!’ And in an instant I was smitten and driven Beyond the porch into the open air. There stood I panting, dazzled by the day Which burnt all golden in the paven square, And gazing back upon the gloomy porch As on the sulphur-spewing mouth of Hell. Then one, a tall grave wight in priestly robes, Strode to me, crying, ‘Hence! profane no more The Temple with thy presence!’ but I call'd My curse upon the place, and lifting hands, Again cried out on God. THE PRIEST. What man art thou That darest in this holy place blaspheme, Knowing God is not, knowing the wise have proved All gods to be a shadow and a snare? THE PILGRIM. God is! He hears! O God, send down a sign To slay these slaves who torture Christ Thy Son! THE PRIEST. Wild is thy speech. What hast thou heard or seen, To rob thee of thy wits and make thee mad? THE PILGRIM. In there the Christ is worse than crucified; He moans, He bleeds beneath the torturer's knife! THE PRIEST. O fool! what is this Christ of whom you rave? A man of Judah, who, being mad like thee, Eighteen long centuries since was crucified, And cried the self-same wild despairing cry To God who could not, or who would not, hear? What wrought he for the world? A net of lies! What legacy bequeath'd he? Tears and dreams! I tell thee, man, that those who uplift the knife In this fair Temple of Humanity Have heal'd more wounds in man's poor suffering flesh Than e'er your Christ did open in man's soul. Your God had sacrifice of lambs and beeves, A holocaust whose smoke did blacken heaven! We to a fairer god, the Spirit of Man, Offer in love a few poor living things Whose sufferings by use are sanctified. THE PILGRIM. E'en as ye serve the meanest of His lambs, So serve ye Christ, the Shepherd of the flock! THE PRIEST. Man is the Shepherd of this world, and we The friends and priests of Man; to Man alone Belongs the privilege of dispensing pain; All lower things are means and instruments; And if to save him but a finger-ache 'Tis meet the baser types should bleed and die. Look round upon this City! Years ago Your Christ, a hideous Phantom, haunted it, And in his train Disease and Pestilence, Foulness and Fever, danced their dance of Death. Our wise men came and drave the Phantom forth, And since that hour the ways are bright and clean; Disease is banish'd, Pestilence is now An old man's memory, Death itself is turn'd Into the servant and the slave of Man. THE PILGRIM. Death comes indeed! Ye have not vanquish'd Death! THE PRIEST. Death is the holy usher stoled in black Who cometh to the wearied out and old Saying, ‘Your bed is made—'tis time to rest!’ Right gladly to the solemn death-chamber They follow, and are curtain'd in that sleep Which never yet was stirr'd by man or God; And yet they die not, since no force is lost, But passeth on, and these survive for ever In children ever coming, ever going, To make the merry music of the world. THE PILGRIM. Merry, indeed!—made up of tears and moans, Of fair things martyr'd, frail things sacrificed, In name of that most cruel god of all, The godless Spirit of Man! and lo! at last Your children are baptized with blood of beasts, And heal'd with death of innocent childlike things, And strengthen'd out of slaughter. Woe is me! That ever child should draw his strength from death, And be the heir of cruelty and pain! Like one half waking and half sleeping, risen From spirit-chilling visions of the night, Uncertain of the world wherein he walks, Haunted and clouded, thro' the City I pass'd; And voices seem'd afar off, and all sounds Ghostly and strange, and every face I met Fantastic, melancholy, and unreal: And weary hours pass'd by, and still I walk'd; And in the end I found myself alone Upon a green hillside beyond the town, Entering a beauteous Garden of the Dead. The place was green and still, with shadowy walks, And banks of gracious flowers; and ranged in rows Along the grassy terraces were placed White urns that held the ashes of the dead,— In each of these a handful white as salt Left from the cleansing fire; and in the midst There stood a building like a sepulchre From the iron heart of which a pale blue flame Rose strange and sacrificial; hither came The bearers with their burdens linen-wrapt Which being dropt into the furnace-flame Shrivell'd like leaves and swiftly were consumed. While near the fiery place I gazing stood I saw from out the glistening gate of brass An old man issue, naked to the waist, And holding in his hands a silver urn. Still darken'd and perplex'd I spake to him, And when he answer'd, setting down the urn And gazing at me with lacklustre eyes, His voice seem'd ghostly, faint, and far away. ‘Art thou the sexton of this place?’ I cried; And straightway he replied, wiping his brows, ‘Adam the Last, the watcher of the fire— That is my name and office, gentle sir.’ THE PILGRIM. So, Adam, last or first, the old order stands? Your masters have not yet abolish'd Death! ADAM. Nay, God forbid! (alas! the foolish name I learnt when I was young!)—Death comes to all; The one thing sure and best—man's Comforter! THE PILGRIM. Can men that are so merry, having upbuilt A City so serene and beautiful, Still welcome silence and the end of all? ADAM. Yea, verily—though should they hear me breathe The dreary truth, the rulers of the City Might rob me of mine office, gentle sir; But by thy face and raiment I perceive Thou art a stranger, coming from the land Of gracious gods and old, where I was born. Fair is the City, as thou sayest, and merry, Yet many men grow weary of its mirth, And ere their time would gladly welcome sleep! THE PILGRIM. How so? 'Tis surely bliss for any man To live and gladden in so sweet a place? ADAM. I know not. Times are changed. In times gone by, When Fever and Disease and Pestilence Walk'd freely through the streets and garner'd men, I have mark'd upon the brows of those that died A light that comes not now. I have stood and watch'd By deathbeds, and as Death bent down to grasp The throbbing throat and clutch the fluttering life, I have seen him shrink and like a frighten'd hound Crouch panting at the flash o' the dying face, The proud imperious wave o' the dying hand; Yea oftentimes, when men call'd out on God, Defying Death with smiles, it seem'd a charm To affright the Phantom which affrighteth all! THE PILGRIM. Yet now men welcome Death, as thou hast said. ADAM. Yea, but how differently, how wearily! With no sweet hope of waking, with no thought Of meeting those who have fallen to sleep before; With no glad childish vision of delight To come upon them when the morrow breaks Happy and loving as a father's face. They know their day is o'er, and that is all: What matter if it hath been sunny and merry, 'Tis ended—night come duly—all is done. Moreover, nowadays, methinks that men, Knowing so clearly, love not one another As in the good old times when I was young! For, look you, master, wedlock is a bond Between the strong and strong, who know that soon All fall asunder in Death's crucible; And when a man or woman dies by chance, What use to mourn?—the vase of life is broken, And there's an end; wherefore, methinks that men Knew more of Love when they were mourn-fuller. For Suffering and Sorrow walk'd the world Like veilèd angels pointing heavenward, And folk were sadder then, but hopefuller; And now, indeed, since Hope hath gone away With all the other angels, Death alone Remains the one cold friend and comforter. Now much I marvell'd, hearing such sad speech Drop from the old man's mouth like simple sooth; And gazing down upon the glorious City Which sparkled in the sunshine under us, Seeing the earth and air alive with life, And catching from afar the faint glad cries Of multitudinous creatures fluttering Like motes in the sunbeam, still I seem'd to be A ghost upon the borderland of Death, Having no portion in humanity; And like another ghost the old man seem'd, Garrulously babbling with a voice as thin As any heard in dream; then side by side We walk'd together to the highest bourne Of that fair burial-place, and lo! I saw, Stretching before me on the further side, A darkness like a mighty thunder-cloud— Darkness on darkness, far as eye could see. ‘What land lies yonder at our feet?’ I said, And pointed downward. Gravely he replied: ‘Nay, sir, I know not, but I have heard folk say A melancholy and a sunless land, Forest on forest, dreary, without bound,— Haunted by monsters, beasts and saurians Of the primæval slime; a land, alack! Unfit for man to dwell in, melancholy As were the dusk beginnings of the world.’ Then in my dream, which seem'd no dream at all, Methought I leapt, like one who takes the plunge From some black cape into a midnight sea, Into that gulf of darkness; and the night Crash'd round and o'er me, as I sank and sank Down, down, to dark oblivion deep as death, When for a space I lost all count of time, But senseless lay amid the ooze and drift Of the unconscious shadows; yet at last I stirr'd and waken'd, lying like a weed On a cold isle of moonlight in the midst Of cloud on cloud breaking like wave on wave Around me; thro' the darkness I perceived Far off the glowworm glimmer of the City Which I had left behind. Feebly I rose, Affrighted at the cold new stir of life Along my veins, and murmur'd, ‘Woe is me! I live, who would have died; I am quick, who fain Would have return'd to stony nothingness! And I have search'd the world, and left the prints Of my sad footsteps on the tracts of Time, Yet am I houseless and a wanderer still From City unto City, knowing at last My quest is fruitless and my dreaming vain!’ Then with a cry I faced the seas of night, And blindly hasten'd on, I knew not whither! BOOK XV. THE CELESTIAL OCEAN. Methought I pass'd into the shadowy land Where Nature like a gorgon mother sits Devouring her own young; a rocky land, Formless, chaotic, lonely, terrible, And yet alive with monstrous shapes as strange As e'er mad poet fabled: shapes that lived, And moan'd, and open'd jaws chimæra-like, And changed, and died; yet ever when I sought To approach them, faded into lifeless forms Of crag and rock. In stagnant sunless meres I saw foul monsters swim, some serpent-wise, Others web-footed like the water-birds, While overhead, from a black mountain-peak, The wingèd pterodactyl of the chalk Flapt to its eyrie on the snake-strewn shore. ‘Almighty God,’ I moan'd, ‘whose Hand did frame These hideous creatures of the ooze and slime, Within whose lineaments I seem to trace Strange far-off hints of sweeter shapes and forms Flowering at last in naked flesh of man, Haunt me not with the deathlike fantasy Of pageants fit for Hell!’ And as I spake Meseem'd I felt within my living veins The speckled blood that steals like quick-silver Under the hydra's skin, and knew my sense Sick with primæval foulness of the slime From which 'twas fashion'd when the Monster ruled A rank and watery world. Yet I beheld Within that land of portents pale gray men Who stood and smiled, as happy children smile On curious gnomes and trolls of Faeryland; And many murmur'd, ‘Wondrous is the Lord! Whose word hath touch'd the darkness, till, behold, It stirs and breathes and lives!’ How long I walk'd In that wild realm I know not, but at last I found myself ascending a steep path Upwinding to forlornest mountain-peaks; And as I went the light grew cheerfuller, And far away above my head I saw A light clear space of sun-kist snow that seem'd Like God's hand resting on the Mastodon That felt it and was still; and suddenly There flew across my path a bright-eyed bird Of eagle-size, but whiter than a dove, And fluttering upward lighted on a rock And waved its pinions looking down upon me, And when I follow'd rose and fled again, Again alighting; thus from rock to rock It flew, I following, while at every step The light grew clearer, and my soul less sad. At last methought I reach'd a green plateau Far up among the peaks and loud with sound Of many torrents falling; and the grass That grew thereon was strewn with tiny shells, Prismatic, beautiful, left by the lips Of some receding sea; and pausing there, I gazed into the valleys I had quitted, And saw a darkness as of flood and cloud Spear'd by the red lance of the setting sun, And from the darkness came a solemn sound, Terrible, elemental, as of waves Wandering without a home. While thus I stood, I saw two shapes approaching from the peaks, One leading and one following: that, a Child, Bright as a sunbeam, merry and golden-hair'd, Who ran before and beckon'd, ran again And beckon'd pausing; this, a reverend man, Clad in a robe of samite white as snow, And leaning on a staff enwrought with shapes Of flower and dove and serpent. As they came Great awe fell on me, for methought ‘They come To bring me tidings that my search is done!’ Fair was that Child, and 'neath her rosy feet The coarse grass blossom'd into crystal blooms, And fair was he who follow'd reverently— Most proud his step as if he walk'd on thrones, His dark eyes suffering with the kingly light They shed upon me through his reverend hair. And coming near, the Child with birdlike cries Paused, looking on my features wonderingly, Then turning quickly beckon'd once again, And slowly approaching he who follow'd her Did greet me like a monarch welcoming Some stranger to the kingdom which he rules; Then looking on my pilgrim's staff and scrip, And pouring into my half-dazzled eyes Strange lustre of his own dark orbs, he said: ‘Welcome, O Stranger, to these lonely peaks! Far hast thou travell'd from a weary world To find firm foothold on the mountains here.’ And as he spake he placed his gentle hand Upon the bright head of the Child, who stood Smiling and listening; and his voice was deep As torrent-voices partly drowning it, Yet musical and passionately calm. THE PILGRIM. Far have I travell'd, wearily have I sought A world of sense and phantoms, shapes and signs,— Since in an earthly City last I stood Wailing my lot and calling out on God. THE MAN. Be comforted—here shall thy cry be still'd, Or drown'd in voices more miraculous. Thou comest from the City where I was born? THE PILGRIM. The City men have builded, without God? THE MAN. The same. These hands of mine did help to raise Some of its temples, and its inmost shrine. When I drew breath 'twas but a noxious marsh With some few dwellings long untenanted, But in the heyday of my youth I cried: ‘Upbuild! create a City out of stone That we who know not God may dwell therein;’ Saying moreover, ‘Wiser far are they Who drain the marsh and make the market thrive Than they who waste their toil on pyramids.’ Ev'n while I spake the City of Man upgrew, To music sweet of the invisible choir Who form the dusky vanguard of the dead; And temples rose like lilies from the mere Of human creatures multitudinous, And Night was vanquish'd, and Disease and Pain Crept from the shining of the strange new light. THE PILGRIM. But Death remain'd. THE MAN. And reign'd! Ere long I saw The Shadow veil'd with sunlight looking down Upon the beauteous City we had built; And with a spectral hand he pointed ever At the glad pageant, at the heart of man, And at the living soul within the soul. Then thought I, ‘Man hath conquer'd God, not Death, And the broad harvest Man hath sown Death reaps;’ And surely I had madden'd in despair, Had I not seen one morning, as I stood In the still burial-place beyond the City, This Child, who ran and play'd among the tombs, Blown hither and thither like a butterfly By some strange wind of gladness; then behold, She beckon'd, and I follow'd (for methought She was not as the common things of earth, But wondrous, fed on some diviner air); And from the gates she drew me with a smile Until I came, as thou thyself didst come, Among the darkness of primæval Time, Haunted by monsters, hydras, mastodons, Strange forms, the slime of Chaos; but whene'er I falter'd faint of heart, the Child ran back And slipt her little hand into mine own, And prattling of the sunshine and the dawn Did draw me gently on, until at last I left the haunted valleys and beheld A stainless snow like to the hand of God Lying on yonder peaks; and even yet I know not if the thing that led me on, And leads me ever, is a mortal Child, Or some angelic presence sent to guide My footsteps through the shadows of the world. THE PILGRIM. An angel, surely! See how rapturously Her happy face is shining into thine! An angel still, if human; for methinks Her eyes reflect the glory and the dream Of God's celestial City which I seek. Yet surely this is evil, that thy feet Still tread the loneness of the mountain-tops, Thine eyes see not the splendour she hath seen? THE MAN. It is enough to know that such things are, Beyond the silence and the setting sun. THE PILGRIM. Alas! how knowest thou not that after all They are not phantasies and images Like those that met thee yonder in the vales? Alas! if thou hast won these lonely heights. What hast thou gain'd, what have thy soul's eyes seen More than the souls in yonder City see? THE MAN. The peace of God, the assurance of His heaven, Seen mirror'd in the blue eyes of a Child! THE PILGRIM. But surely Death shall follow and find thee here? THE MAN. I wait his coming, eager for more light Such as he brings to those who love its beams, Yet not impatient, for from these high peaks I look on more than mortal sight can measure Or human soul conceive and apprehend: Dawn flying like a dove from isle to isle Of Chaos; infinite and wondrous life Stirring from form to form; the march of lives From sleep to sleep, from death to death; the flow Ofearth's progressions, and the ebb of Time. Wherefore mine age is clothed with mastery As with a garment; slowly I have learn'd That to be young and innoeent is best, Next best it is to be serene and old. THE PILGRIM. Having beheld these things, beholding still Their stress and pain, dost thou believe on God? THE MAN. I know not. What is infinite transcends The seeing of the finite, evermore. Gaze in the heavenly eyes of this fair Child, And thou shalt see a light more mystical Than all thy spirit can conceive of God. Pilgrim of earth, wouldst thou behold a sign? Conceive the inconceivable, attain To prescience which would prove, if absolute, The annihilation of thy thinking soul? Come, then, and standing yonder on the peaks, The highest point of earth, survey the waste Of that mysterious Ocean without bound, Which wash'd thee hither as a grain of sand And sow'd thee deep among these drifts of dust To quicken into strange humanity! He ceased; and on the heights above his head The daylight faded, while the hand of Night Hung closed a moment o'er the rayless snows, Then open'd suddenly and from its grasp Loosen'd one lustrous star! Then with a cry The Child sprang upward on the dizzy path, And paused above us beckoning; and we follow'd From crag to crag till we together stood Close to the edge of that celestial Sea Which breaks for ever on these dark shores of earth. Lone on the heights we stood as on a strand Oceanward gazing; and the world beneath Faded to an abyss of nothingness, Unseen, unheard, unknown, but at our feet The waves of ether rippled, gleam'd, and broke In silence; and as far as eye could see The waste cærulean stretch'd in windless calm, Here bright, there shadowy, strewn with shimmering flakes Like lunar gleams; and suddenly, to lend New splendour to the solitary scene, The island of the moon broke into beams And shook upon the azure shallows around Wild shafts of silver: then the stillness grew Intenser, and the deep ethereal voids Seem'd opening to their inmost, till I saw Far as the pin-point of the furthest sphere In the dark silence and abysm of space, And from the far-off unimagined shores There came, or seem'd to come, a stir of sound So faint it scarce did seem to touch the sleep Of that vast Ocean! Then with reverent eyes Up-gazing, and upon his pallid face Light falling faintly from a million worlds, Thus spake that old man masterful, my guide: ‘Thou seekest God—behold thou standest now Within His Temple. Lo, how brilliantly The Altar, fed with ceaseless starry fires, Burns, for its footstool is the mountain-peaks, The skies its star-enwoven panoply!— Lo, then, how silently, how mystically, Yonder unsullied Moon uplifts the Host, While from the continents and seas beneath, And from the planets that bow down as lambs, And from the constellations clustering With eyes of wonder upon every side, Rises the murmur which Creation heard In the beginning! Hearken! Strain thine ears! Are they so thick with dust they cannot hear The plagal cadence of the instrument Set in the veilèd centre of the Shrine!’ He ceased, with arms outstretch'd to the great Deep In adoration; and once more I seem'd To catch that music, rather felt than heard, Out of the open'd heavens; and lo, it grew Deeper, intenser, audible as breath, With thrills as from the silvern stops of stars And murmurous constellations! ‘Hearken yet! He murmur'd, while I trembled to my knees, ‘Yonder the veil'd Musician sits, His feet Upon the pedals of dark formless suns, His fingers on the radiant spheric keys, His face, that it is death to look upon, Misted with incense rising nebulous Out of abysmal chaos and cohering Into the golden flames of Life and Being! And underneath His touch Music itself Grows living, heard as far as thought can creep Or dream can soar; so that Creation stirs, And drinks the sound, and sings!—So far away He sits, the Mystery, wrapt for ever round With brightness and with awe and melody; Yet even here, on these low-lying shores, Lower than is the footstool of His throne, We hear Him and adore Him, nay, can feel His breath as vapour round our mouths, inhaling That soul within the soul whereby we live From that divine for-ever-beating Heart Which thrills the universe with Light and Love!’ THE PILGRIM. So far away He dwells, my soul indeed Scarcely discerns Him, and in sooth I seek A gentler Presence and a nearer Friend. THE MAN. So far? O blind, He broods beside thee now Here in this silence, with His eyes on thine! O deaf, His voice is whispering in thine ears Soft as the breathing of the slumberous seas! THE PILGRIM. I see not and I hear not; but I see Thine eyes burn dimly, like a corpse-light seen Flickering amidst the tempest; and I hear Only the elemental grief and pain Out of whose shadow I would creep for ever. THE MAN. Thou canst not, brother; for these, too, are God! THE PILGRIM. How? Is my God, then, as a homeless ghost Blown this way, that way, with the elements? THE MAN. He is without thee, and within thee, too; Thy living breath, and that which drinks thy breath; Thy being, and the bliss beyond thy being. THE PILGRIM. So near, so far? He shapes the furthest sun New-glimmering on the furthest fringe of space, Yet stoops and with a leaf-light finger-touch Reaches my heart and makes it come and go! THE MAN. Yea; and He is thy heart within thy heart, And thou a portion of His Heart Divine! THE PILGRIM. Alas! what comfort comes to grief like man's To weave a circle of sweet fantasy Around him, and to share so dim a dream? For if thy calm philosophy be true, He is, yet is not, here; breathes with our breath, Yet evermore eludes us like the stir Of the unconscious life within our veins; Haunts us for ever in a mystery, Broods close within us 'tween our walls of flesh, Yet when we seek to look into His eyes Fades far away above us and looks down With loveless eyes of stars. Meantime my quest Is for a City builded on the rock, Not on the raincloud; for a God whose face Is humanised to lineaments of love; Not one who, when my hand would clutch His robe, Slips as a flash of light from world to world And fades from form to form, then vanishes Back to the formless sense within my soul Which evermore pursues and loses Him! E'en as I spake methought (so strangely changed My wondrous dream that was no dream at all) That not alone we stood on those dark shores, But round us gather'd ghostly living forms Featured like men and women, pointing hands Out to the dusky space and starry isles; And on the sands below them silent lay Two bright transparent forms as if asleep— One old and hoary, featured like a man, The other maidenlike and golden-hair'd; And o'er these sleeping, smiling as they slept, That radiant Child bent tearfully and cried, ‘Awake, awake!’ but they awaken'd not, Though quietly the lucent waves of light Crept near and rippled round their shrouded feet. Then said aloud that old man masterful: ‘They are not dead but sleeping,—vex them not, Their eyes shall open on serener shores. We come from the eternal night to find, And not to lose, each other; what is born And liveth cannot die.’ And while those forms Still pointing wildly seaward moan'd and sobb'd, He murmur'd, ‘Ere these twain lay down and slept, They pray'd the prayer and sang the song which Man Hath made from the beginning. Sing it now, That He who listens through eternity Yonder across the azure seas may hear.’ And lo, methought, in piteous human tones Those spirits bent above the dead and sang:— Unseen, Unknown, yet seen and known By the still soul that broods alone On visions eyesight cannot see, By that, Thy seed within me sown, Forget not me! Forget me not, but hear me cry, Ere in my lonely bed I lie, Thus stooping low on bended knee, And if in glooms of sleep I die, Forget not me! Forget me not as men forget, But let Thy light be with me yet Where'er my vagrant footsteps flee, Until my earthly sun is set, Forget not me! Though dumb Thou broodest far away Beyond the night, beyond the day, Across the great celestial Sea, Forget me not, but hear me pray ‘Forget not me!’ By the long path that I have trod, The sunless tracks, the shining road, From forms of dread to forms of Thee, By all my dumb despairs, O God, Forget not me! Forget not when mine eyelids close, And sinking to my last repose, All round the sleeping dead I see, Yea, when I sleep as sound as those, Forget not me! Forget me not as they forget, Hush'd from the fever and the fret, From all long life's remembrance free, Though I forget, remember yet— Forget not me! Then even as they sang meseem'd I saw Far off upon the rippling waves of light A shadowy Bark approaching with no sound, Wing'd like an eagle, floating ominously On that aërial sea; from space to space Of brightness, and from shadow on to shadow, It moved, until at last its shining prow Touch'd the dusk shore, and paused; and in it sat A Spirit dark and hooded, girt around With many shining forms,—and not on these The Spirit gazed, nor on the shapes that throng'd The sands of earth, but on the spectral faces Of that worn hoary man and gold-hair'd maid Who lay there waiting, smiling in their shrouds. Then as the very heart within me fail'd, And on that sight I gazed through blinding tears, The old man stretching white hands heavenward Cried: ‘Lo, the life which ends and but begins! God that remembers, Death that ne'er forgets, The dream of generations justified! O Grave, where is thy victory! O Death, Where is thy sting! O deathless Mystery, At last we apprehend and sleep in peace! For this the timorous nebulæ cohered To fashion luminous worlds; for this the night Conceived and labour'd, till the infant Life Quicken'd within its womb and stirr'd and lived; For this all things have striven and agonized, Flashing from ever-changing form to form, Yet, as the flame ascending clarifies, Growing for ever purer, peacefuller, Till that divinest growth, the Soul of Man, Was fashion'd paramount and stood supreme, And trembling with the very breath it drew, Knowing itself, beheld within itself The inspiration it hath christen'd “God,” And which alone betokens it divine!’ Then, as he spake, methought that radiant Child Approach'd him, knelt, with eyes divinely glad Look'd up in his, and all the seas of heaven Kindled and brighten'd, while with out-stretch'd arms Of blessing, drinking in with rapturous gaze The splendour of the radiant universe, The old man cried: ‘O Mystery Divine, Simple as babble of the yeanling babes, And gentle as the breath of mother's love! How far we seek thee o'er these wastes of Time, And find thee not, although thou broodest ever Within us, like an ever-homing dove! Nay, all we see, upon these luminous walls Of sense conditioning and surrounding us, Is what thine Eldest-born and Best-beloved Saw long ago,—a crimson cross of pain, A cipher which whoever reads hath read The riddle of the worlds. And Man hath raised City on city, creed on creed, hath sought To chain the electric lightnings of the soul In temple upon temple, all in vain; Yet what he found not visibled in form Hath haunted him with dreams invisible From height to height, till like a god he stands Perceiving good and evil, knowing himself Thine effluence, and immortal. Thus the law Within him, yet without him, justifies The eternal law he cannot understand Yet drinks like royal breath; and all his pain Falls from him like a garment, leaving him Naked and warm in light, a happy child Sure of his birthright, innocent and wise, Foredoom'd to that eternal hope and joy Whose other names are God, and Life, and Love!’ Aye me, the tearful wonder of my dream! For shapes of brightness raised those twain who slept And placed them in the Bark, when through their frames The crystal splendour of eternity Shot sacramental; and the hooded Spirit Bent o'er the dead, and his dim eyes distill'd Bright tears like dew, while all those shining shapes Gather'd around and sang the same sweet hymn Which those had sung who throng'd the lonely shore. Though deeper than the deepest Deep Be the dark void wherein I sleep, Though ocean-deep I buried be, I charge Thee, by these tears I weep, Forget not me! Remember, Lord, my lifelong quest, How painfully my soul hath prest From dark to light, pursuing Thee; So, though I fail and sink to rest, Forget not me! Say not ‘He sleeps—he doth forget All that he sought with eyes tear-wet— 'Tis o'er—he slumbers—let him be!’ Though I forget, remember yet— Forget not me! Forget me not, but come, O King, And find me softly slumbering In dark and troubled dreams of Thee— Then, with one waft of Thy bright wing, Awaken me! Then lost in wonder, standing on that shore, The highest peak of earth, I sigh'd aloud: ‘Yea, God remembers, God can ne'er forget! . . . I have gone inland and not oceanward— The earthly Cities only have I known— But these who sleep shall waken and behold, Yonder across those wastes whereon they sail, God and the radiant City of my Dream!’ And as I spake the ether at my feet Broke, rippling amethystine. Far away The mighty nebulous Ocean, where the spheres Pass'd and repass'd like golden argosies, Grew phosphorescent to its furthest depths: Light answer'd light, star flash'd to star, and space, As far away as the remotest sun Small as the facet of a diamond, Sparkled; and from the ethereal Deep there rose The breath of its own being and the stir Of its own rapture. Then to that strange sound Stiller than silence, the pale Ship of Souls Moved from the shore; I stood and watch'd it steal From pool to pool of light, from shade to shade, Then melting into splendour fade away Amid the haze of those cærulean seas. L'ENVOI. ? ?????? ?????. O blessèed Death! O white-wing'd form Still winging through the night! O Dove, that seekest through the storm Some lonely Ark of Light! While the dark flood of human pain Rises with weariest moans, Touching and falling back again From heaven's deserted thrones, Thou wanderest on with wondrous wings On that celestial quest! And looking on thee, weary things Sob tearfully and rest! What were the world and what were Man Without thee, heavenly Death? An empty sky; a starless span, A mist of troubled breath! The one thing sure, the one thing pure, The one thing all divine, Though all else ceases, doth endure, Though all grows dark, doth shine! Our souls have probed this world of clay, And measured the great sea, Our sight hath conquer'd night and day, But still thou soarest free! Wisdom hath cried, ‘No God! not one! Nay, heaven and earth shall cease!’ But as thou passest, winging on, We hush our cries in peace. For all things fade, save thou alone, Bird of the sleepless wing! From world to world, from zone to zone, We see thee voyaging! Angel of God, still homeless here, Now clouds have hid God's face,— Bright Dove that on these waves of fear Can find no resting-place! O blessèd Death,—O Angel fair, Still keep thy course divine! Till o'er the flood of our despair The Bow of God doth shine! The Outcast. (1891.) AD CARISSIMAM PUELLAM. A gray Sea wrinkling dark, And out on the dim sea-line A Barque Becalm'd amid silver shine, While gazing over the Sea From an Isle of yellow sands, Sat we, Holding a book in our hands! Do you remember, Dear, The time and the place and the tale? The drear Ocean, the one sad Sail? We sat there, spirit-stirred, In the rainy Hebrides, And heard The wash of the windless seas, While ever, upraising eyes, We saw the Ocean, the gray Cold Skies, And the Sail afar away! Still as the still hours fled, That day of gentle gloom, We read Our tale of Death and Doom,— Of the Outcast woe-begone Who, 'mid the Tempest's roar, Drave on Homeless for evermore. Dearest, his piteous tale Made your clear eyes grow dim; Snow-pale You read, and you pitied him! ‘How sad, how strange,’ you sigh'd, Out 'mid the Storms to roam, Denied The lights of Heaven and Home! ‘Dead, yet a thing with life, Under the blight and the ban, At strife With God, forgotten by Man!’ I whisper'd, ‘Nay, but hear How he learn'd the Love Divine!’ More near You crept, and your hand sought mine; Under those sunless skies, We follow'd the dark strange theme, Our eyes Alive with love and dream; And then, when the tale was done, And you turn'd your face to me, The Sun Shone out upon the sea: Rainy and dimly bright Out of a cloudland pale, The Light Stream'd on that lonely Sail! . . . We thought of Poets lost Whose souls still voyage on, Storm-tost By His wind, Euroclydon; Born to divine despairs, Kingly yet trampled down, Sad heirs Of the Martyr's cross and crown. We thought of the English-born Childe with the bleeding breast, All scorn, Pride, and sublime unrest. Yea, and that other too, Pallid and radiant-eyed, Who drew The Hyperion glorified! We thought of Singers dead Who shared the Outcast's doom And shed Songs on the Sea, his Tomb: Of him who wildly flies No more on the Waters deep, But lies In gray Montmartre, asleep! [How loud his shrill voice rang! Yet often his voice grew clear And sang Songs that a child might hear!] Of him who strongly smote The Scald's harp laurel-crown'd, Afloat On a stormy Surge of Sound! Softly upon my breast I laid your golden head, And prest My lips to your brow, and said: ‘Mine was that Outcast's doom,— Tost 'mid the surge of shame, All gloom Until my Darling came! ‘Scornful of Nature's plan I nurst my pride and grief, A man Stony in unbelief. ‘This little hand of snow Touch'd the hard rock, my heart, And lo! Its stone was cleft apart,— ‘Then came the blessed dew, The consecrating tears! I knew God's Love after all those years! ‘Thus was I saved, redeem'd, As even His Outcasts are!’ Bright gleam'd The Light on the seas afar! We sat there, spirit-stirr'd, In the rainy Hebrides, And heard The wash of the windless seas, While rainy and dimly bright Out of its cloudland pale, The Light Stream'd on that lonely Sail! THE FIRST CHRISTMAS EVE. ‘A world without a God! Heigho! . . . The good old God had merit, though! Le Bon Dieu, gravely interfering In all Humanity's affairs, Bowing His kind gray head and hearing The orphan's moans, the widow's prayers, Was worth, or so it seems to me, Whole cataracts of Tendency; For though He now and then grew crusty, And damn'd some few (as all gods must), He Was patient 'spite deep provocation With the small things of His creation! Jesus He loved, and tolerated Even Goethe's patronising nod! Century on century He waited While great philosophers debated, Then, finding men dispense with “God,” Took His departure from the earth, Where still some limbs were genuflected, The day that Schopenhauer had birth,— And left the human race dejected!’ Without, while in my chambers dreary I mused and watch'd the flickering flame, The snow fell thickly, night winds weary Moaned miserere! miserere! And shivering revellers went and came. 'Twas Christmas Eve! The bells were ringing In faintly joyful jubilation: I heard the tidings they were bringing But groan'd apart in indignation. My plans in life had all miscarried; My only friends were dead, or married; My book (that Epic you remember) Had gone to wrap up cheese and butter; And lonely, in the lone December, As feebly as a leaf may flutter From bough to bough while bleak winds blow, Till rough feet tread it in the mire, This heart of mine had sunken low, Dead to the world and its desire! ‘Confound their superstitious revels!’ I murmur'd, spirit-sick and sour, ‘I'll dine with Care and the blue devils And curse the world with Schopenhauer! There is no God, and all men know it Except the preacher and the poet; Women are slaves and men are flunkeys, The best but well-developed monkeys, And Virtue is—a huswife's sampler, Self-sacrifice—an usurer's chatter; Once Heaven was sure and Hope was ampler, But now the Devil rules Mind and Matter! Le Roi est mort—destroy'd and undone, Or impotent and deaf and blind— So vive le Roi of Hell and London, Who weaves a shroud for Humankind!’ Peace upon earth! good will to men! The bells rang out with sad vibrations. I poked the fire, pursued again My misanthropic meditations. The last new Philosophic Pill, A panacea for every ill, Is—‘Quit thy service in the Shrine Prophets and seers have deemed divine, Give up the Sphinx's dark acrostic, Be neither atheist nor agnostic, But, since thy days are just a span. Worship and praise the new God, Man! He shall endure when thou art dust, Gain that of which thou art bereaven, He shall absorb thy love and trust, Thy dying struggles shall adjust The ladder which he climbs to heaven! The better thou, the grander he, This god of thee and thine, shall be! And in the thought of his perfection, To which all creatures are proceeding, Thy soul shall 'scape from its dejection Caused by too much eclectic reading!’ Service of Man,—or Monkey? Far Better to sit rectangular, And like a dervish contemplate My very navel till it grows The central whirligig of Fate, The Rose of Heaven that burns and blows! Better to dance with barefoot souls, Like good John Calvin, on hot coals, And, full of sin yet grace-deserving, Face the Arch-enemy without swerving! But worship Man? Go back once more To image-worship as of yore, And bend my head and bow my knee To this King Ape, Humanity? This stomach-troubled, squirming, aching, Mud-wallowing creature of a day, This criticising, this book-making, Fretful, dyspeptic thing of clay! This Multi-face whom it hath taken Ages to learn to wash and dress! This horde of swine, doom'd to be bacon, And now, by countless devils o'ertaken. Shrieking in impotent distress! This mass of foulness and of folly Through whom the Paracletes have died! This Yuletide carcase deck'd with holly In honour of its Crucified! Now great Jehovah lies o'erthrown, Shall the mere Pigmy reign at last? Pshaw, rather worship stick or stone, And let Humanity crawl past! ‘Man as an individual, I Hold first of creatures 'neath the sky, But though I'm human at the best, Man the Abstraction I detest! Collectively, this Human Race, Despite its brag and self-acclaim, Its pride, its pompous talk, is base; Ever, in every clime and place, Its record is of sin and shame! Bright holocausts of martyr'd blood Mark its progression up the ages; The sensual protoplasmic mud Bespatters even its Seers and Sages! Nay, what are all the human crew But maggots from corruption bred?— “By heaven, we talk like gods, and do Like dogs!” Nat Field has wisely said! ‘A poor half-witted Caliban, Wailing his nature and condition, Still prone upon the mud, is Man, And ne'er can be his own Magician; Far less, far less, his own supreme Master and Lord and Arbitrator! Nay! till the stars shall cease to gleam, The wretch shall blunder in a dream And say his Noster in cœlis Pater! In Heaven (or, if you please, in Hell) Must reign the Lord of man and woman— Not 'mid these shadows where we dewll, Not on this blood-stain'd sward where fell The foolish gods who have loved the Human. Nay, man can ne'er by man be shriven, By borrow'd rays his star must shine, Not threefold heritage in Heaven Could purge his spirit of its leaven, Or make the Upright Beast divine!’ . . . While thus I mused, I heard without A foot that blunder'd on the stair, Then sounds of one who groped about To find a door—‘Some dun, no doubt!’ I thought, not rising from my chair. Then some one softly knock'd. I stirred not But sat stone still as if I heard not. . . . Again!—‘Come in,’ at last I cried, Whereon the door flew open wide, And on the threshold there was seen A stranger, elegant of mien, Tall, white-shirt-fronted and dress-suited, Faultlessly gloved and neatly booted, Who, paletot upon his arm, Opera hat upon his head, Smiled at my start of vague alarm, And pausing ere he enter'd, said— ‘Pardon this call so unexpected. I sail from England, sir, to-morrow, And to your room have been directed A little kind advice to borrow. If I have been instructed rightly You are a Poet, and the man I seek for’ (here he bow'd politely),— ‘I'm sure you'll help me if your can.’ So saying, he closed the door behind him, And threw his coat upon a chair, While I, a little piqued to find him So confident and debonair, Cried, ‘Who the Devil are you?’ The light Fell on his features waxen white, His raven ringlets thinly threaded With silver as he stood bareheaded, His black moustache, and underneath Two pearl-white rows of smiling teeth. ‘The Devil?’ he cried. ‘Pray did you mention That very primitive invention, Who surely, whatsoe'er cognomen You give him—Satan, Ahrimanes, Baal, Moloch—though he awes old women, The merest fiction of the brain is? The Poets have invented for us Some six or seven Fiends that bore us— Chiefly the one your gentle Milton Set the high buskin and the stilt on, And taught to make speech after speech to A God extremely given to preach, too! Nay, Goethe even, though well acquainted With his infernal subject, painted A fiend impossibly malicious And supernaturally vicious. Sir, the real Devil, Science teaches, Not only wears man's hat and breeches, But shares Humanity's affliction. In short, sir, Satan is a fiction, Save in so far as we sad creatures Assume his airs and ape his features.’ I listened in amaze, while he, Smiling at my perplexity, Advanced into the room and stood Full in the firelight's crimson glow,— A lithe, tall form of flesh and blood, Yet pallid as the bloodless snow: A modern shape such as we meet Cigar in mouth and homeward strolling After the play, in Regent Street, Where Phryne trips with loitering feet And lissome Lais goes patrolling. Answering his smile I cried, ‘Who is it? Your name? and why this midnight visit?’ Fixing on me his bright black eyes, ‘A poet, sir, should recognise,’ He answer'd, ‘one who has so long Been theme for satire and for song! I' faith, I am somewhat widely famed As Philip Vanderdecken, named The Flying Dutchman!’ As he spake I seemed to hear the surges break On some steep shore, while thunder-crashes Answer'd the Tempest's fiery flashes! My head swam round—I shrank in dread From that world-famous Form of fiction. ‘Pray calm yourself,’ he laughing said, ‘For we are fellows in affliction! The cliques have damn'd you too, I hear, For many a melancholy year, Because, in trying hard to double, Against a stream of tears and trouble, The Cape of Desolate Endeavour, And reach Fame's Ocean (smooth for ever!) You used bad language, loudly swearing, For great or small gods little caring, You'd toss on Life's mad Sea until You'd work'd your wild poetic will! Sir, you lack'd reverence, as I did, Who in my impotence derided The Artificer of storm and thunder, The great Self-Critic of Creation: And now, like me, you've learn'd your blunder, You hug your doom and desolation. Well, well, let gods and critics be, Sit down a little space with me, Comparing notes, our friends commending, Cursing our foes, this wintry night! Come, though our strife is never ending, We've had our pleasure in the fight! Not fearing Hell or hoping Heaven, We face the Elemental Flood; Far better to be tempest-driven Than rot upon the harbour mud!’ ‘A ghost!’ ‘A man!’ ‘A poet's theme, Woven of nightmare and of dream!’ ‘Nay, flesh and blood, sir—there's my hand To prove it!’ Laughing low, I took His ring'd white hand in mine, and scanned His marble features like a book. No sun-brown'd, wind-blown face, but one Strange to the shining of the sun, And sicklied o'er with sad moonlight Beneath its ringlets black as night; So young, and yet so old!—so still, So callous and so coldly proud; The eyes so bright, the cheeks as chill As some dead sleeper's in his shroud. Gazing, I heard, beyond the sound Of happy church-bells ringing round, The murmur of the sleepless Sea Stirring and breathing balefully, While Argus-eyed and strangely fair The wintry Heaven, stooping low, Laid softly on its stormy hair, With sighs of blessing and of prayer, Thin tremulous finger-tips of snow! Then cried I, wakening from a trance, That sad sea-music in my ear, ‘Whoe'er thou art, whatever chance Brings thee this night, be welcome here! Spectre or mortal, man or devil, Draw up thy chair and toast thy toes, And while the world prepares for revel Tell o'er thy rosary of woes! I, too, as thou hast aptly said, Have had my share of castigation; I, too, with fretful, feverish tread Have paced the decks of life, and shed My sullen curses on Creation. Sit, kindred spirit; let's together Rail at the stupid heavenly fiction; Come summer days or wintry weather, We brood apart in contradiction. We know the world—there's nothing in it, Now gods and heroes have departed; Palsied and feeble, every minute It grows more melancholy-hearted. The Creeds have withered one by one,— Frost-bitten roses in the garden; There's nothing left beneath the sun But lives that pass and hearts that harden. Sit down, sit down, my gallant Rover, And tell me, in the name of wonder, What brought thee down the Straits of Dover To this sad City shadow'd over With fog and vapour, mist and thunder?’ Then smiling, comfortably seated In the warm firelight's flickering glare, He told his tale as I entreated, With tranquil after-dinner air,— Turning his talk aside each moment For light contemporary comment, That showed him apt in whatsoever Was taking place from here to Hades— Most diabolically clever, And intimate with lords and ladies; Familiar with the latest news, The freshest novels of sensation, Scandal of palaces or stews, The last misconduct of the Muse With bards of naughty reputation; Well read in Science, verst extremely In current philosophic knowledge; As intimate with works unseemly As any Fellow of a college; In short, an intellectual Dandy, With every art of culture handy— Libertine, with a touch of passion, Callous, but sadder than he knew— Sceptic of course, as is the fashion, Yet somewhat superstitious too;— For fiercely as his wit might strike On God and gods and men alike, His furtive glances as he spoke Belied the open laugh and joke, As if he fear'd, despite the sneer, Taught by a secret intuition, The coming of some Shape of Fear, Or some celestial Apparition! He told me of his doom, and how Despairing he had roam'd till now From land to land, from sea to sea, In his doom'd Ship upon the Ocean, As bored as any soul could be, And soul-sick of the troublous motion. His crime? The form of his offence Against avenging Providence? He laugh'd, and told me. ‘Unbelief! Too much philosophy,’ said he; ‘I laugh'd, at all the gods-in chief The Æon who is One in Three! Although a sailor of the main, I was a man of erudition, And having logic in my brain Saw syllogistically plain The blunder of His Proposition! For this, sir, and for minor sins, Not unconnected with Eve's daughters, He pull'd my ears and kick'd my shins, And drove me out upon the waters.’ ‘A contradiction—if you knew God was not, could God punish you?’ He laugh'd. ‘Precisely! Many a man Has argued so since Time began! But know the cause of my disgrace, And with my argument agree: I swore to the Old Fellow's face He was not, and He could not be! His thunder answer'd: but I proved 'Twas only phantom-drift and cloud— The more the elements were moved Against me, more I laugh'd aloud! Then some one interceded—'twas, As usual, one of Eve's dear sex! And on a day it came to pass, Standing upon the slippery decks, I heard that I from time to time Might cease upon the waves to dance. “Father, he knew not of his crime, Give the poor devil another chance!” “One chance—a dozen!”—answered He, Whom I had proved could never be! So said—so done! The Eternal Force, Law, Love, Power, God, whate'er youplease To name it, steered my sleepless course To land for intervals of ease; And there, at the divine request Of her who deem'd me worth retrieving, I roam'd about and did my best To grasp what millions die believing. In vain! in vain! where'er I went, Folly and death were all I found, My upas-tree of discontent With dead sea fruit was rightly crown'd; I found both men and women rotten, I saw no joys but health and money, Love was a fable long forgotten, While Lust, though sweet, was poison'd honey. I knew all creeds, all superstitions, All gods that men and women rever. I tried all customs and conditions, Adopted every priest's petitions, And got the same old answer ever. The answer? Your dyspeptic German Has given it—Death! Annihilation! So back to sea, half ghost, half merman. Scorning the terrors that deter Man, I hasten'd, sick of all Creation!’ I listen'd wondering. Thoughts as drear Had haunted me for many a year, And yet so phrased they seem'd to be Accurst and full of blasphemy. Into his face I look'd again And saw my soul's reflection there,— Pallor of passion and of pain, Shadows of cruel, black despair: A spirit poison'd through and through, Yet hungering for the sun and dew; A nature warp'd and wild, yet fraught With agonies of piteous thought; A soul predoom'd to Death and Hate, Yet eager to be saved and shriven— A life so wholly desolate It seem'd fierce irony of Fate To mock it with one glimpse of Heaven! ‘A hundred years ago,’ said he, ‘Began my folly or my crime; Since then I've kept a Diary To pass away my idle time. Just for a joke, 'tis written in Mine own red blood, on parchment skin (Best for the brine and wet), and here Upon my heart for many a year I've kept it. Would you care to view it?’ So saying from his breast he drew it— A book with many a finger-mark, And placed it in my hand—and while I glanced across its pages dark, He prattled on with cynic smile. ‘Like a young lady, truth to tell, I've kept my cordiphonia well! My thoughts, my careless meditations, Are all set down in these queer pages— My bonnes fortunes and my flirtations, Sketches of ladies of all nations— Tall, short, dark, fair, and of all ages! There's matter there of strange variety, Strange retrospects of sport and scandal, Which any journal of society Would roundly pay, methinks, to handle. They are at your service, if you please To use them—prithee look them over— Memoirs are now the mode, and these Are highly spiced, as you'll discover! They prove at least that such a quest— To find true love and self-surrender, Is but a foolish, idle jest! I've roam'd the world from east to west, Found many kind, and some few tender, But never one prepared to give Her soul that he she loved might live, And Death's last draught of hemlock take For some poor damnéd devil's sake. I'll grant you, Man were saved and proved Immortal, could he thus be loved; But no! the seed of Eve our mother Is capable of much, but never Of wholly losing for another All stake in happiness for ever! They'll love, and even accept damnation, So they but hold their man the surer, But absolute obliteration Of self for his soul's preservation, Demands diviner powers and purer. I've tost the gauge to God, and cried: “Prove such self-abnegation to me! Find such a Soul—I'll stoop my pride, Admit the justice I denied, With which you torture and pursue me. Assume one Angel possible, And God is surely proved as well! Admit one soul from self set free, You prove Man's Immortality. The problem's fair! As I'm a sinner, The Old One finds it hard of proving; I hold myself an easy winner, After a century of loving.”’ ‘Peace upon earth! Good will to men!’ The bells rang out around the room, Beyond the frosted window pane The still snow wavered through the gloom: Hung on the wall above my head A prickly branch of holly bled Bright drop by drop—berry and thorn Symbolic of that Christmas morn! ‘Not one,’ methought; ‘yes—One who gave His life that those might live who die! Rabbi,’ I cried, ‘come from Thy grave, To give this mocking voice the lie!’ He laughed. ‘My wager, sir, concern'd The softer sex and not the other! A million hearts like yours have turn'd For comfort to our Elder Brother. In vain! He found, as we must find, The baseness of all humankind, And broke His gentle heart in proving Sisters and brethren not worth loving! He, too, in that consummate minute, As I have done, His God denied; He play'd for Heaven and fail'd to win it, Bow'd a despairing head, and died!’ E'en as he spake the bells peal'd loud In clearer, wilder jubilation; He listen'd, with his dark head bow'd, A little space in meditation,— His face toward the fire, his soul Black as the sullen flickering coal. Suddenly from the embers came A tremulous blood-red hand of flame, Touch'd him upon the forehcad, lit His gloomy cheek and crimson'd it As if with fire from Hell!. . . and still The white snow waver'd through the gloom; ‘Peace unto men! peace and good will!’ The bells, in mockery of his doom, Rang loud and clear! ‘Enough,’ he said, ‘Our King of Doctrinaires is dead. Once, I believe, one wintry night, Hundreds of years ago, He rose, And blundered with His ghostly light Across the drift, amidst the snows, Forded the narrow seas and found The Devil and Pope Joanna crown'd, Set side by side beneath the dome Of great St. Peter's, there in Rome; Then, finding He too soon had risen, And was not wanted or expected, Back to His resting-place and prison He hasten'd sleepy and dejected, And laid Him down, and closed His eyes— There, dead as any stone, He lies! Poor fellow! He was disappointed, Like all your dreamers in the end; What God the Father left unjointed, Shapeless and vile, no priest anointed, No seer, no doctrinaire, can mend. Enough of Him, enough of folly! What use o'er fruitless dreams to ponder? Pull down your evergreen and holly, And hang the skull and crossbones yonder. Sweeter than constant introspection The light afloat which rovers follow— There's not a creed will bear reflection, There's never a god escapes dissection, Not even Jesus or Apollo! I know where man stands now!—I've studied Your last philosophies right through— Found my poor intellect bemudded, Grown sceptical and bitter-blooded, And curst the whole pragmatic crew. 'Sdeath, what a waste of time, to pore On all such melancholy lore— Only to find this world as silly, As puzzled, as in times long gone, When grew from Christ's pure Hûleh-lily The prickly ????? of St. John!’ He paused, then added, ‘All this season, During my residence among you, I've search'd the poor stale scraps of reason The last Philosophers have flung you. I've read through Comte, the Catechism (Half common sense, half crank and schism), And Harriet Martineau's synopsis; Puzzled through Littré's monstr'-informous Encyclopædia enormous, Until my brain grew blank as Topsy's; I've suck'd the bloodless books of Mill, As void of gall as any pigeon; I've swallow'd Congreve's patent pill To purge man's liver of Religion; I've tried my leisure to amuse With Freddy Harrison's reviews; I've thumb'd the essays of John Morley, So positive they made me poorly; Turning to follow with a smile The tea-cup tempests of Carlyle, I've been amazed at times to view The proselytes Tom fill'd with wonder— Ruskin, half seraph and half shrew, And divers dealers in cheap thunder. I've also, Heaven preserve me! read Daniel Deronda! which was worse Than any doom a wretch may dread, Except, of course, pragmatic verse! The Leben Jesu, Renan's Vie, I also studied thoroughly; I vivisected cats with Lewes, I tortured gentle dogs with Ferrier, Found out just what grimalkin's mew is And how tails wag in pug and terrier, But came, however close I sought, No nearer to the riddle of Thought! With Huxley's aid, now much in vogue, I made cheap Knowledge all my own. And kissed, allured by Tyndall's brogue, The scientific Blarney-stone! I talk'd with Bastian, who affirms Spontaneous generation proven, And, prone with Darwin, watch'd the worms Wriggling—like live eels in an oven. Then finally, in sheer despair, Burn'd deep with Scepticism's caustic, Found Spencer staring at the air, Crying “God knows if God is there!” And in a trice, became agnostic! ‘In this most fashionable creed, Which even he who runs may read, I found an Open Sesame To England's best society. The great Arch-Priest of Canterbury Kindly invited me to dine, And with the Bishops I made merry Over the walnuts and the wine: Found them agnostic to a man, But doing all good fellows can To make their crank old Ship, the Church, Still staggering on with many a lurch, Take in her sails and trim her anchor Before the Storm swept down and sank her. I met Matt Arnold at their table, Where no Dissenter hoped to be; Voting the Trinity a fable I dived as deep as I was able Into the “Stream of Tendency!” Then floating on, in soul's distress, Currents that swirl to righteousness, Was bound, half drowning, to assever “Poof! further off from God than ever!” ‘About that time I met a girl With raven hair and teeth of pearl, And just one touch of rouge to veil The ennui of a cheek too pale. One evening, after we had sat In the Lyceum, wondering at The great tragedian wrapt in gloom Of Hamlet's sable cloak and plume, We, strolling down at midnight-tide To the Embankment, paused to see The two stone Sphinxes, heavy-eyed, Crouching together side by side And gazing at Eternity. “Behold,” I said, “the Mystic Ones Who know the secret of the suns, And coldly sit in contemplation Of the dark riddle of Creation!” She laugh'd. “My dear, don't heed” (she said) “Those rayless eyes—try mine instead! Love's the one riddle worth the guessing, Woman the one Sphinx worth caressing! Don't mind those stony ancient Misses Who cannot feel and cannot see— Quit things incapable of kisses, And take a hansom home with me!”’ While, diabolically sneering At every system, foul or fair, He prattled on, I nodded, hearing The echo of mine own despair— Indeed, the mocking voice I heard Seem'd more within me than without: Yea, every thought and every word Chimed discord to my dread and doubt. Fainter and fainter, as it seem'd, Grew the strange ghostly Form of fancy, Till, rubbing eyes as if I dream'd, I cried, ‘By heaven, 'tis necromancy! Ghost, alter ego, dull delusion Of sense and spirit in confusion, Begone! avaunt! back to the Ocean Of vague primordial emotion From which you came!’ But as I spake He rose, with eyes that flash'd like steel! ‘Nay, shake your sleepy soul awake,’ He said, ‘and know that I am real! Yet now my period of probation Ends for the present, and I go Back to the watery desolation The cruel Ocean's ebb and flow— Hark, hark, they call me!’ Tall and wild He panted quick as if for breath, His pallid face no longer smiled, His eyes grew sunken, dim with death, And from the distance, through the swells Of moaning wind and Yuletide bells, A faint sound broke upon mine ears Of ‘Hillo, hillo—come away!’ Then laughter as of marineres Hoisting their anchor 'mid the spray; Nay, more, I seem'd to catch the sound Of whistling cordage, flapping sail. I gazed aghast—my head went round— The house seem'd rocking 'neath the bound Of billows shrieking to the gale. ‘Once more, once more,’ he moaned aloud, ‘Adrift, unpitied, lost in gloom, As lonely as a thunder-cloud, I fly to face the blasts of doom! No peace, no rest, on earth or heaven— No respite yet,’ I heard him cry, ‘Spirit of Pain, to be forgiven! To rest a little space, and die!’ Then all my soul was strangely stirred To pity, and my eyes grew dim; And quietly, without a word, I stretch'd my hands out, blessing him! But louder, clearer, through the dark, With, ‘Hillo, hillo, come away!’ Those voices from some phantom Barque Rang, while he trembled to obey; A moment more, he rose his height, His eyes shot gleams of baleful light, His hands were clench'd, and with a shriek Of mocking laughter, he return'd: ‘I come! I come!’ But lo, his cheek Grew frozen, and though his dark eyes burn'd With wicked fire, his body grew Bent as with centuries of care,— Transform'd he shrank before my view, With snowy beard and sad grey hair! Yea, e'en his raiment seem'd to change To something ancient, quaint, and strange— Rags blown with wind and torn with storm That round a skeletonian form Clung wild as weeds. Ah! then indeed I knew God's homeless Outcast, he Who, poison'd with the Serpent's seed, Can ne'er be purified or freed Till Death shall drink the mighty Sea! I saw him for a moment thus, Storm-beaten, old, and blasphemous, All desolate and all forlorn,— Then, while I pitied his despair, The bells rang in the Christmas morn, And he had vanish'd into air!. . . That was in Yuletide '77. Ten winters later I again Beheld beneath the sunless heaven, Pallid in ecstasy of pain, That outcast Shape: or did I only Dream, and behold him as I dream'd No longer desolate and lonely But beauteous and at last redeem'd? Of that sublime transfiguration My later song, not this, must be— Meantime I mark in meditation His dreary voyage to salvation Across a sad and sleepless Sea. Here follow, tuned to English tongue, The Flights of Vanderdecken, sung By one whose soul oft seems to share His doom of darkness and despair. Accept the songs, O Reader! weft Of that strange Book the Outcast left, Mingled with warp of modern fashion. Telling the story of his quest, His weary wanderings without rest, I seem to plumb mine own soul's passion! Here, then, the Modern Spirit stands, Holding within his ring'd white hands The Book of Doubt, the Writ of Reason! While foolish women weep and wonder, He ponders in and out of season And gropes from blunder on to blunder. He needs no Devil to beguile him, While wine and wantons lure and wile him; He needs no God to thunder o'er him, While Nature spreads her storms before him. This is the Modern—this is he Who would, yet cannot, bend the knee! Who would, yet cannot, be once more A child in the soft moonlight kneeling! All creeds he knows, all wicked lore That puzzles thought and palsies feeling. How shall he yonder heavens afar win In poor Spinoza's merry-go-round? How shall he 'scape the apes of Darwin, Dark'ning what once was fairy ground? How in this tearful world, tomb-paven, Shall he find resting-place and haven? How? By the magic which of old Set yonder suns and planets spinning! By that one warmth which ne'er grows cold, By that one living Heart of gold Which throbs and throbb'd at Time's beginning! By that which is, and still shall be, In spite of all Philosophy! From that we came, to that we go, By that alone we live and are— Core of the Rose whose petals blow Beyond the farthest shining star! Safe, despite Nature's cataclysm, Sure, though the suns should cease to shine, Love burns and flames through Thought's abysm, Serene, mysterious, and divine! One little word solves all creation, Abides when Death and Time have pass'd— Damn'd by the genius of Negation, Man shall be saved by Love at last! [Herein lies a Mystery] AD LECTOREM. Herein lies a Mystery, If you but knew it! Peruse this strange History— You'll never see thro' it, Till Love learns your blunder And comes to assist you: When, smiling and weeping, With heart wildly leaping, You'll find, to your wonder, God's Angels have kissed you! GENTLE READER, Read herein, English'd and versified out of the Double Dutch, THE STRANGE FLIGHTS of PHILIP VANDERDECKEN, called the Flying Dutchman, Being a Record of His Amours in all climes and countries; His experiences of all complexions; His Conversations with the great Goethe, and other persons of reputation, some still living; His curious and often improper Reflections on Men, Manners, and Morals; with a full, true, and particular account of His Various Religious Opinions; The whole showing, in a series of Startling Episodes, How, having been Damned, By reading the philosophy of Spinoza, He was finally Saved By the Love of a Woman. CANTO I. MADONNA. More than a hundred years have fled Since Philip Vanderdecken read Spinoza, and was damn'd. . . . For days He ponder'd in a dark amaze The Demonstration Absolute Mortal nor angel can confute, Which proves the Eternal One must be Divorced from Personality; Establishes sans contradiction The fact more terrible than fiction Of the mysterious Substance shed Through stone and tree, the quick and dead, Suns and the glowworm, bread and leaven, Sunlight and moonlight, Fool and Seer, Earth-dung, the nebulæ of Heaven, Shakespere's calm smile and Arouet's sneer And having ponder'd every cranny O' the argument, not missing any, The Captain, standing all forlorn In his brave vessel off Cape Horn, Swore with a mighty oath and round Spinoza's argument was sound! ‘Damn me for evermore,’ said he, ‘If any Personal God there be! If there be any worth a straw Stronger than primal Force and Law, Why, let Him show his power and keep Our vessel struggling on the Deep For ever and for ever.’ Thus This Mariner most impious Call'd on the Spirit of Creation To approve Himself—by his damnation! Becalm'd on billows bright as brass That slowly 'neath her keel did pass But broke not, lay the lonely Barque Scorch'd by the sunlight, stiff and stark. From the high poop the Captain view'd The sad and watery solitude. Tall, lithe, and sinewy, marble pale Despite the stings of many a gale, With hair as ebon black as night, Black eyes alive with ominous light, White teeth, and lips of lustrous red, Rings on his fingers waxen white As frozen fingers of the dead; And though the garb that wrapt his form Was rough and fit to face the storm, And of a long-past fashion, he Was dandified exceedingly; His whole appearance, all would grant, Byronically elegant! Nor young nor old, but just the age To cozen maidens not too sage, And kindle thoughts and looks that burn In dames of a romantic turn. The ship, a Dutchman weather-beaten, With wind-worn sails and decks worm-eaten, High poop, and for a figurehead A Woman Form with arms outspread, Stript to the waist, and serpent hair Falling upon her shoulders bare, Roll'd like a log, and rose and fell Groaning upon the molten swell. His crew, a hideous band, were such men As only can be found 'mong Dutchmen— Squat, fat, red night-capp'd, hairy dogs, Gruesome and guttural as hogs, Yet ghostly, with lacklustre eyes Full of strange light and dark surmise; Faces that could not smile, although Their voices croak'd with laughter low, As they crept feebly to and fro. They all were scar'd as by a brand Held in some cruel Demon's hand, And show'd the trace of every sin That blurs the soul or stains the skin. Most were the very froth and scum Of mortal mariners, but some Were well-born rogues of education Gone wrong through vice and dissipation. The mate, the meanest rascal there, A lean thin rogue with hoary hair, Could quote a thousand sayings pat in Sanscrit and Hebrew, Greek and Latin, And by the metaphysicians show That black was white and soot was snow; For he, so arm'd with wicked knowledge, Had been Professor of a College, And occupied with reverend air The moral-philosophic chair, Till wine and women, which so few shun, Had brought him down to destitution, And he had been compell'd to gain His bread upon the stormy main. The ruffians shared their Captain's doom, But each to him was as a satyr; They watch'd him, while with looks of gloom He ponder'd deep on Mind and Matter; Clustering at the mast they stood Like hounds that feel their master nigh; They knew the devil in his blood And fear'd the lightning of his eye— Then broke to many a mutter'd curse On him and all the Universe; For well they knew by many a sign, Within them and without, that they Were exiles from the Grace Divine And doom'd to toss upon the brine, Branded and curst, and cast away! Three days and nights the calm had lain Upon the seas with blistering rays, Hot as a forge the suffering Main Lay throbbing, flashing back the blaze; On gaping decks and sails that hung Like shrunken foliage dry to death, The heaven sent down a serpent's tongue Of sunlight, and with fiery breath The burning Skies, the scorching Sea, Embraced each other lustfully. But salamander-like, while all His seamen cursed the sultry weather, The Captain paced with calm footfall The blistering decks for hours together. Indifferent to the beams that fell On his proud head like flames of Hell, E'en thus he poised and weigh'd and sifted The Problem with Spinoza's aid; But when his eyes at last were lifted And his decision at last was made, Suddenly, with a troublous motion, The sleeping waters of the Ocean Awoke and moan'd! thick cloud and gloom Enwrapt the ship, and sudden thunder, With blood-red gleams and sulphurous fume, Tore the great darken'd Deep asunder! And lo! like monsters fiery-eyed The great waves rose on every side, And shriek'd, tumultuously driven Beneath the fiery scourge of Heaven. ‘Hoho!’ the Captain laughed, ‘is this Your answer, O ye Elements! The same old argument, I wis, To justify Divine intents! Think you I quail because you grumble? Think you I change because you swear? By heaven, the Universe shall crumble Before you cow me into prayer! Away! away! I heed your screaming No more than any teapot's steaming! Roar yourself hoarse, ye slavish surges, In awe of what appals the creature! Swallow the pill that twists and purges Your watery bowels, mother Nature! I, son of man, being man at least, Can still preserve my self-respect here: What churns you Elements to yeast, What terrifies each mindless beast Awes not the form that stands erect here! Away! away!—Hell and the Devil Approve your dread, while I hold revel, And, scornful of your protestation, Laugh, lord and master of Creation!’ Long nights and days, through gulfs of gloom, The ship accurst was fiercely driven— Now swallow'd deep in ocean-spume, Now lifted like a straw to heaven— Like some struck bird that ere it dies Trails its wet wings and seeks to rise, But flutters feebly down again Smit by the lash of wind and rain. Still on the decks the Captain clung, Lick'd by the lightning's serpent-tongue, And still his cold defiant cry Answer'd the threats of sea and sky. But when the Seventh Day dawn'd, behold! A thin pale Hand of fluttering gold Stole thro' the clouds, and silently Touch'd the wild bosom of the Sea, So that it softly rose and fell With tearful sob and windless swell; And gently on the waters lay The silence of the Sabbath Day. O gracious day of peace and calm! When, sweetly and supremely blest, On the world's wounded heart falls balm And frankincense of perfect rest! After Creation's storm and grief, After life's fever and life's woe, One long deep breath of soft relief Eases all Nature's lasting woe! The Sabbath of the Universe Abides, though gods and systems cease— The human doom, the primal curse, Is hush'd to sacramental peace. Now and for ever, comes the sign God giveth His belovèd sleep, While music of some choir divine Steals softly in from Deep to Deep! It touch'd the Outcast's weary brow, It calm'd his stormy soul's distress. He had not fear'd God's wrath, but now He trembled at God's gentleness! Standing in desolation there, He seem'd to hear from far away Soft chimes that fill the Sabbath air When happy mortals flock to pray; And o'er green uplands he could see A spire—Faith's finger—peacefully Pointing to Heaven!—A moment thus He linger'd, pale and tremulous, Then through his heart again there stole The pride that poisons sense and soul, And from his brow he shook again The benediction all may gain— ‘A day of rest! A day of peace! Perish the lie,’ he fiercely said— ‘Nay, not till Heaven and Earth shall cease, Till death shall mingle quick and dead! If God could rest, Man resteth never! Storm is his portion now and ever— He laughs that one day out of seven Shall justify the frauds of Heaven! Accept your Sabbath, winds and waves, Rest for a little from your sorrow,— The cruel Hand that made ye slaves Shall lash your backs again to-morrow! Man knows no Sabbath, no cessation Of utter storm and tribulation! Man stands erect, defiant, knowing From Death he comes, is deathward going! Man, first of things and last of blunders, The crown of Nature and her shame, Stands firm, and neither prays nor wonders, Lord of the Tomb from which he came! Suddenly, as he spake, the Barque With mist and cloud was wrapt around, But as between the dawn and dark Soft lights of sunrise with no sound Part the dim twilight and reveal The morning-star as bright as steel, E'en so the mist was blown apart Like dark leaves round a lily's heart, And in the core thereof were seen Still bright'ning shafts of golden sheen, Dazzling his sight—yet dimly there He saw, or seem'd to see, a Form With saffron robe and golden hair, Walking with rosy feet all bare The Waters slumbering after storm! A maiden Shape, her sad blue eyes Soft with the peace of Paradise, She walk'd the waves; in her white hand Pure lilies of the Heavenly Land Hung alabaster white, and all The billows 'neath her soft footfall Heaved glassy still, and round her head An aureole burnt of golden flame, As nearer yet with radiant tread, Fixing her eyes on his, she came! Then as she paused upon the Sea, Gazing upon him silently With looks insufferably bright And gentle brows beatified, He knew our Lady of the Light— Mary Madonna heavenly-eyed. How still it was! The clouds above Paused quietly and did not move; The waves lay down like lambs—the air Was hush'd in sad suspense of prayer— While coming closer with no sound She hover'd pale and golden crown'd And named his name! And even as one Who from dark dreams of night doth stir, And fronts the shining of the sun, With haggard eyes he look'd on her! But as he gazed his sense grew clear, His dazzled brain shook off its fear, And all his spirit fever-fraught From agonies of cruel thought, Rose up again in callous scorn— ‘Vision or ghost, whate'er you be, Welcome afloat this Sabbath morn, Bright Shining Wonder of the Sea! Methinks I seem to know,’ he said, ‘That face so fine, that form so fair,— They hung in childhood o'er my bed And from the village altar shed Soft influence over folk at prayer. And yet, I know, 'tis only fancy, Some bright delusion of the brain, Poor Nature plays such necromancy To cheat our reason, all in vain. I would each optical illusion That sets poor mortals in confusion Were beautiful and bright and pleasant As that which haunts my sight at present! Rose of a Maid, I bend in duty Before thy miracle of beauty! Speak, let me hear thee—if a spirit Is capable of conversation, By Venus, I would gladly hear it 'Mid these dull gulfs of desolation!’ How still it was!—and could it be A voice that answer'd, or the Sea Just stirring softly in surcease Of tempest into throbs of peace? Low as his own heart's beat, yet clear And sweet, there stole upon his ear An answer faint like Sabbath bells Heard far away from leafy dells Buried in leaves and haze, so still And soft it only seems the thrill Of silence through the summer air— A sigh of rapture and of prayer! MADONNA. Child of the storm, whose spirit knows No reverence and no repose, Who disbelievest God the Lord And holdest Humankind abhorr'd, Knowest thou Me? VANDERDECKEN. Madonna, yes! How oft thy radiant loveliness Has shone upon me with soft eyes In earthly picture-galleries! By Raphael's and Murillo's brushes, So skilled to catch thy lightest blushes, By Tintoretto and the rest, Thou'rt even fairer than I guess'd! MADONNA. Dost thou believe in God my Son? VANDERDECKEN. A categoric question, one Most difficult to answer rightly And, at the same time, quite politely! Frankly, Spinoza's text has showed The impersonality of God; And for thy Son, well, I opine No mortal man can be Divine, Nor may a maid who takes a mate Conceive yet be immaculate! MADONNA. Blasphemer! Is there man or woman, Or any shape divine or human, Or any thing, save Death and Sin, Thy wicked soul believeth in? VANDERDECKEN. Madonna, no! I grieve to tell I question Heaven and smile at Hell, Believe all human creatures are Accurst in each particular, Especially the sex of madam Who gave the fruit to falling Adam! MADONNA. Christ help thee! Hast thou never loved? Never known woman's love, or proved The depth of faith that dwelleth in her? VANDERDECKEN. Never, as sure as I'm a sinner! I like the sex, 'neath sun and moon Have found full many a bonne fortune; But that deep faith have never met. MADONNA. Yet woman's love might save thee yet! VANDERDECKEN. Madonna, how? Though now, I fear, Past saving, I would gladly hear! MADONNA. Then listen! By the charity Of Him who loveth even thee, By Him whose feet flash'd down on dust Shall bruise the hydra heads of Lust, By Him, my Son, who cannot rest E'en in the Gardens of the Blest, But ever listening strains His ears To catch the sound of human tears, From Him, who fain would kiss thy brow, I offer thee redemption. VANDERDECKEN. How? MADONNA. Thy doom it is to wildly beat Without a home to rest thy feet, Monster, yet featured like a man, And lonely as Leviathan. So far thy doom hath been fulfill'd And found thee stubborn and self-will'd, But now my Son shall suffer thee, One short year out of every ten, To leave thy Ship upon the Sea And wander 'mong thy fellow-men. There shalt thou seek (and mayst thou find!) Some gentle shape of womankind, Who in the end shall freely give Her life to death that thou mayst live; Who loving thee, and thee alone, Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone, Heart of thy heart, content to share Thy loneliness and thy despair, Shall from the fountains of her soul Baptize thy brows and make thee whole. Then, with that woman, hand in hand, Shalt thou before the Master stand, Saying, ‘By her thy love hath sent, Lord, I believe, and I repent!’ VANDERDECKEN. Madonna, this thy boon to me Seems somewhat of a mockery! Have I not proved, do I not know, By long experience here below, No woman, howsoever tender, So capable of self-surrender? Love comes, love goes, and is the one Sweet conquering thing beneath the sun, But never have I seen or noted One human creature so devoted That I could say, ‘Her soul is mine, And God is good, and Love divine!’ Spare me the respite, if you please, And let me stop upon the seas. MADONNA. Not so! The Lord, my Son, commands, And thou shalt search through many lands, Yea, search and search, though it should be Through most forlorn Eternity. Thy manhood, in immortal prime, Shall triumph over Death and Time, Thy face into the very Tomb Shall peer, yet keep its living bloom; Nature shall aid, from Earth's dark breast Shalt thou take gold to aid thy quest. Begin thy search whene'er thou wilt, Pass on through clouds of sin and guilt, Range every clime, search every nation, Until thou light on thy salvation! So saying, as a star grows bright Then flashes into sudden night, She vanish'd! and the sleeping Main Awaken'd monster-like again, Shook the loose brine from its fierce hair, And shriek'd in tempest-toss'd despair, Then crouching for a moment, roar'd Before the Lightning's sudden sword, Thrust thro' and thro' and thro' it, and then Drawn flashing up to the heavens again! With whistling shroud and thundering sail, The Ship sped on before the gale, The seamen lifting spectral faces With ‘Hillo! hillo!’ took their places, And on the poop, while on they flew, The Captain thunder'd to his crew. From night to day, from day to night, Through gulfs of gloom the ship took flight, Until, although the bitter blast Shriek'd still, and the great waves made moan, The troubled heavens grew clear at last, And through the storm-mist drifting fast A cold wan Moon was wildly blown, And on the surge-vex'd ocean ways Shed down her melancholy rays. Then gazing southward through the night They saw, o'er seas that blackly roll'd, A starry bale-fire blazing bright— The Southern Cross of glistening gold! Suddenly, as they look'd thereon, The blast fell still—the Storm had gone! And though the waves, too sad for rest, Still heaved as one tumultuous breast, The wind grew faint and stirr'd like dim Breath on a mirror o'er the Sea, While near the heaving ocean-rim The great Cross crimson'd balefully! Then while deep dread and dim eclipse Lay on the watery solitude, And on the decks with soundless lips And awe-struck hearts the outcasts stood, Out of the ghostly twilight stole Great frozen Spectres from the Pole. Silent and dim and marble pale, Like ship on ship with frozen sail, They crept from out the vaporous gloom, Each misted with its own cold breath, And cluster'd round the Ship of Doom Like shrouded giant shapes of Death. Still grew the Deep with scarce a stir— Still lay the Barque while all around The Bergs, like one vast Sepulchre, Closed in upon it with no sound! Small as a shallop floating lone Under great mountain-peaks of stone, Seem'd the great Ship, while o'er it rose Crag beyond crag of ice and snows! And now the little light had fled, Chill shadows fill'd the air with dread, And on the cold decks kneeling dumb, Thinking the end of all had come, With haggard faces seam'd with tears Gather'd the woe-worn marineres. But in their midst, erect and tall, The Captain stood without emotion— He whom God's wrath could ne'er appal Smiled at those Spectres of the Ocean. Still unsubdued and undismay'd, Calm and superior, he survey'd The crumbling peaks of strange device, The threatening towers, the chasms dark, The cruel silent walls of ice That closed and closed to crush the Barque! And for a time his lips were seal'd, But when his soul found speech at last His voice like thunder round him peal'd From chasm to chasm cold and vast! ‘Welcome,’ he cried, ‘ye shapes of Death! Goats of the Goatherd throned on high! Come, Phantoms born of God's cold breath, And crush the dust that longs to die! Give him the coup de grâce, ye Slaves Of that blind Force he scorneth still. Annihilate him as he craves, Ye Monsters, at your Master's will! Yet, if the hour be not yet here, Crouch down like dogs and disappear, Fade, Phantoms, from his path, and creep To pasture further on the Deep!’ Thunder on thunder answer'd him! The great Gulf heaved, the heavens grew dim, And like to thunder-clouds storm-driven Together, crashing rent and riven, Totter'd those shapes of ice and snow, As if an Earthquake rock'd below! While toppling peaks and crumbling towers Darken'd the air with frozen showers, Shrieking and waving frosty wings The Bergs replied like living things! And smother'd 'neath the snows that fell As thick as lava snows of Hell, Lay the doom'd Ship upon its side, Beaten and bent, but undestroy'd, While still its Captain's voice defied God and those Spectres of the Void. ‘Judgment! swift judgment and no shrift,’ He cried, ‘are all for which we yearn; This life that was a Monster's gift Back to the Giver we return!’ But as he spake a forkèd track Of windless waters ebon-black Was rent between the frozen mass Of mountains—that the Ship might pass! And faintly, feebly quivering, A bird with trailing broken wing, The ship crept on! Then loud and clear Above the thunders roaring near, The Captain laugh'd! ‘On to Cape Horn— We'll round the Cape at merry morn— Up! up! hoist sail!’ And at the word The frozen crew at last were stirr'd, And gazing round with spectral faces With ‘Hillo! hillo!’ took their places; And slowly, through the Shapes of Snow That drew aside to let it go, Crimson'd by brightening beams of day The Ship of Death pursued its way. CANTO II. THE FIRST HAVEN. I. Whom shall I dedicate this Book to? (Each Canto needs a dedication.) I want some briny Bard to look to For sympathy and inspiration! The theme is primitive at present— Nature undrest, without her stays: To Tennyson 'twould seem unpleasant— He blends no vine-leaves with his bays. Scorning the flesh and all things hot, Will Morris wanders sans culotte, And tries the hydra-mob to tame; While Patmore rocks a baby's cot And sings sweet nuptials void of blame. (Ah! gentle Bards without a spot! Beshrew me if I envy not Such innocent and stainless fame!) Next, though the rogues have wit in plenty, I still must pass politely by The Savile bards, those four-and-twenty Blackbirds all piping in one pic! I do not fancy Lewis Morris Would care for rhythmic freaks so strident— Non sibi Venus mittit flores, Non sibi æquora ponti rident! Matt Arnold seeks for ‘light’ no more But sleeps serene and satisfied; While Edwin, of that ilk, doth pore On screeds of luminous Eastern lore By moonlight on the Ganges' side. Dear Roden Noel, round whose throat Byron's loose collar still is worn, Now tunes his song to one clear note Divinely gentle and forlorn; Far, far from him whom holy choirs Of angel infants stoop to kiss, The stormy doubts, the fierce desires, Of questionable songs like this! George Meredith might serve my turn For thoughts that breathe and words that burn, Or, better still, his master Browning, A sober'd Saul in evening dress; But both these bards would end by frowning At my mad Muse's gamesomeness. No! these respectable and gracious Bards with clean shirts will never do! I need a spirit more audacious, Morality more free and spacious, To inspire my song and help me through. The world is tired of things poetic, But poets are themselves to blame; Their wine's too sickly and emetic, Or, grown too thin and dietetic, It lacks the old flush of morning flame! Far is the cry from Byron's brandy To Pater's gods of sugar-candy! Lost the Homeric swing and trot, Jingle of spur and beam of blade, Of that moss-trooper, Walter Scott, Riding upon his border raid, And pricking south with all his power To capture Shakespeare's feudal tower! Where the swashbucklers throng'd in force The æsthete mounts his hobby horse, And troubadours devoid of gristle Play the French flute and Cockney whistle. Sir Alfred only, gently glad, Stainless and chaste as Galahad, Clothed in white armour like a maid Goes carolling through glen and glade, Singing in silvern tones a song Against the world of lust and wrong— Certain, though all his fellows fail, Of gaining the Parnassian Grail! Peace with these poets one and all! Flowers on their happy footsteps fall! Yet would to Heaven their songs could be More glad, more primitive and free! Ah, for the days gone by! when Singers Were wonder-workers, pleasure-bringers! When Art was bold, when sunburnt Mirth Gladden'd around the Maypole leaping; When the mad Muses tript the earth, Not clad, as now, in silks by Worth, But gipsy-like and briskly skipping! Then, skirts were lifted in the breeze To show brown legs and lissome knees! Then, men were hale and maids were merry, Then, Nature felt the breath of Spring; Then poets shouted ‘Hey down derry!’ And played at kisses-in-the-ring! But when the trumpet-call rang round them Threw armour on and rode to fight, Till in due time the people crown'd them— The Kings of Music, Mirth, and Might! My Dedication? Well, no more I'll linger on this sunless shore, Where prim landlubbers of the island Go gathering shells of verse on dry land! No! o'er the seas I sail, to seek My Homer of the southern seas, Who, proudly pagan, Yankee-Greek, Flung out his banner to the breeze, Then, wandering onward like Ulysses, Heard Syrens sing of Nature's charms, Leaping on shore to greet with kisses The dainty dimpled nutbrown misses, Found the lost Eden in their arms! To thee, O Hermann Melville, name The surges trumpet into fame, Last of the grand Homeric race, Great tale-teller of the marines, I give this Song, wherein I chase Thy soul thro' magic tropic scenes! Ah, would that I, poor modern singer, Spell-bound with Care's mesmeric finger, Might to the living world forth-figure Thine Odyssean strength and vigour! Alas! o'er waves you tost on gladly I sail more timidly and sadly, And find no surcease or protection From mal de mer, or introspection! Yet ne'er the less, in spite of all Mishaps and ills that may befall, Despite the tumult and commotion, The countless shipwrecks of the time, Away I go across the Ocean In this my cockleshell of rhyme! Aid me, O sea-compelling man! Before whose wand Leviathan Rose white and hoary from the Deep With awful sounds that broke its sleep! Melville, whose magic brought Typee Radiant as Venus from the Sea! Who, ignorant of the draper's trade, Indifferent to the arts of dress, Drew Fayaway the South-Sea maid Almost in mother-nakedness! Without a robe, or boot, or stocking (A want of clothes to some so shocking), With just one chemisette to dress her, She lives, and still shall live, God bless her! Long as the Sea rolls deep and blue, While Heaven repeats the thunder of it, Long as the White Whale ploughs it through, The Shape my Sea-Magician drew Shall still endure,—or I'm no prophet! II. Out on the waters, lost in light, His ship fades softly out of sight, While on a beach of golden sands, Shading his eyes with archèd hands And gazing up to heights of palm, Alone the dark-eyed Outcast stands And breathes warm airs of spice and balm: Behind him amethystine seas, Just touch'd with shadows of the breeze, Foam on the red-lip'd reefs that rise Beyond the shallows rainbow-hued— Before him, under burning skies, Rise slopes of pine and sandalwood, High as the topmost summit where A lonely palm-tree stirs its fan Sharp-shadow'd 'gainst the golden glare Of cloudless voids cerulean. And downward from the wooded height A torrent hangs its scarf of white, A sparkling necklace that unfurls Strung with for-ever-changing pearls, Turning the sunlight in its fold To rainbow beams and glints of gold. And down beneath lie rounded huts Tree-shaded, dusky, brown as nuts, With lithe black figures moving slow From sun to shadow to and fro: And from the stillness all around Comes now and then a distant sound Of voices faint and far, that seem As strange as voices heard in dream! In the warm hush of summer weather, The tremulous hearts of Sky and Sea, Like hearts of lovers prest together, Lie still, just throbbing peacefully— And where they mix with sleepy sighs, Soft stirs of bliss and rapturous smile, Upon the Sea's blue bosom lies This jewel of a coral Isle— A dark green spot with gentle gleams Of golden sands and silver streams, With dusky depths of scented glade, And cool wells bubbling in the shade; And over all sleeps soft as balm A glowing Paradisal calm. Slowly, with shadow blotted black On the white sands, the Outcast moves, Leaves the blue waters at his back And gains the quiet coca-groves. His stormy heart scarce seems to beat, His troubled blood scarce seems to flow— ‘If this were Death, then Death were sweet!’ He murmurs in the golden glow. Tall, dark, and strange, a stately form, He walks thro' woods of emerald green, When suddenly the branches swarm With dusky faces mild of mien! He pauses, starts, and looks around,— The faces vanish with no sound, But 'mong the boughs he seems to hear A sound like laughter merry and clear. And presently, beside a pool Blue as a patch of fallen sky, He stands, and in the mirror cool Sees shades of swift bright birds float by. Upon the marge he sits, below Acacia-branches white as snow, And marks his own face worn with care Uplooking from the waters there. Suddenly, as he sits and broods, Come laughter and soft chattering cries, And mother-naked from the woods Steal dusky shapes with wondering eyes! The tropic boughs, the flowery brakes, Grow live with limbs that move like snakes, Great open eyes 'mid opening flowers Gleam out amid these shadowy bowers, The foliage trembling and astir Is full of creatures warm and bright, Who on the sad-eyed Mariner Gaze in mild wonder and delight! He raised his melancholy eyes— And back they shrank with bird-like cries— But when he droop'd his head again And thro' the woods went wandering, With speech as soft as summer rain, Voices that seem'd to sigh or sing, They murmur'd to him in a tongue Most sweet yet scarce articulate, Such as was heard when Love was young And Adam coo'd to woo his mate! All vows, all vowels, language such As bees might use if they could tell Their tremulous thrills of taste and touch Deep in some honeysuckle's cell; Murmur of insects and of birds, Just turning joy to honeyed words,— Half human speech, half speechless cadence, Voluptuous as the time and place, And rapturous as some rosy maiden's Sigh, when she yields to Love's embrace. The simile in that last line Is Vanderdecken's (and not mine) Ta'en from the Notebook written in His own red blood on parchment skin. Henceforward, that the reader may Avoid confounding his reflections With mine, I'll use throughout my lay His own remarks and interjections. So understand, whene'er I quote Passages some consider shocking, Inverted commas will denote 'Tis only Vanderdecken mocking! ‘I turn'd—they vanish'd, with a sound Like music of some scented shower That ceases on warm grassy ground, While all the green boughs rustle round And bright drops cling on leaf and flower. But as I wander'd from the shade The happy creatures follow'd after, Clear voices ran in the green glade Answer'd with rippling peals of laughter! And when into the sun I strode They ring'd me round with throngs at gaze, As if they looked upon a god In mingled worship and amaze! ‘Then one, with laughter low yet clear, Ran from the rest to interview me, But paused at arm's length full of fear And turn'd a wistful face unto me— Beauteous, a woman yet a child, Her gentle eyes upon me bent With humid orbs both sweet and mild, She stretch'd a little hand, then smiled In welcome and in wonderment! And lo, as if a fountain's dew Was scatter'd on my brows and hair, Refresh'd and gladdening ere I knew, I felt the smile, and, smiling too, Shook off the cloud of my despair! ‘Venus! Natura procreans! Te, Dea, adventumque tuum, All living things obey, and Man's Proud spirit vainly plots and plans Thy spells to scatter, and break through 'em! A look—a smile—a touch—suffices To witch our nature and to win it— Stone turns to merry flesh, and ice is Wine warm and rosy in a minute! So was it then, so is it ever, 'Spite all Morality's endeavour! So shall it be, though parsons patter, As long as Man is two-thirds Matter! Won by the face and form of her Who welcomed me for all the rest, I felt my stony heart astir And throbbing gently in my breast. I took her little hand,—and gazed Into her eyes with kindly greeting; Hers did not drop, but, softly raised, Sparkled with pleasure at the meeting! And full of joy, no longer flying The strange sad form from distant lands, Her dusky kinsfolk, laughing, crying, Flock'd round about with outstretch'd hands; Women and men and children small, Dusky and gentle, old and young, Welcomed the stranger,—one and all Uttering the same soft bird-like call, And prattling in that golden tongue; And what I fail'd to understand The kindly folk made bright and clear By smile of face and touch of hand, Which said, “O Stranger, welcomehere!” For they had never seen before A white man on that sunny shore, And to their gaze I seem'd to be Clothed round with grace of Deity! A little bored, a little scorning, I gazed with calm superior air On these wild Children of the Morning Happy with scarce a rag to wear; And some were comely, all were bright With life and innocent delight, And never one among the throng Suspected cruelty or wrong: Happy as beasts or birds, unstricken With modern psychical disease, Free of complaints whereof souls sicken, They felt the sun within them quicken And lived the life of swarming bees: Their very speech, as I have said, Scarce consonanted, clear and sweet As warm winds whispering overhead, As runlets rippling at their feet,— Beauteously fitted to express Anacreontic happiness, One cooing and delicious tone, Like that to Grecian lovers known, ????? ??????? ???????. ‘And so, as on a flowery stream One floateth in a summer dream, Upon this flow of lives, swept round By merry maids and children gay, 'Mid soft delights of scent and sound, I floated and was borne away— From shade to sun, from sun to shade, Laughing they led me thro' the land, And still that dimpled dainty Maid Nestled quite close, and unafraid Smiled in my face and kiss'd my hand. And laughing too, while on me fell The golden glamour and the spell, I wander'd on at their sweet will!— O had I power to paint the scene, Not scribbling with this blood-stain'd quill, But with a brush of sweep serene!— I, the sad Man with dark locks shed Round features worn and marble pale, My lithe form strangely garmented In raiment wrought to brave the gale; Rings on my waxen hands; around My throat a bright scarf lightly wound; On broad brows beaten by the sea A sailor's hat worn jauntily! The centre of the picture, this; Around, dark Darlings of the Isle, Warm bosoms panting full of bliss, Waists to embrace and lips to kiss, And best, that Maiden's sunny smile! Thus was I tangled in the mesh Of those bright moving living bowers! The sun shone free, the wind blew fresh, And Eden smiled, all fruit, all flowers! Far off, beyond the emerald land Sloping to shores of yellow sand, Beyond the stately coca-trees Stirring their fans in the soft breeze, Past the red coral reef whereon The turquoise Sea broke milky white, Far as my dazzled eyes could con Ocean and Heaven mingling shone,— Veil beyond veil of golden light! ‘And now we come to swarms of huts Dusky and brown as coca-nuts, Beneath a crag that skyward towers Festoon'd from crown to base with flowers: Some high, like great brown birds'-nests, clinging High up and with the tree-boughs swinging, Some fallen like husks of fruit and lying Wide open on the grassy sward; And hither and thither, multiplying Like happy bees in sunlight flying, Fresh flocks of happy creatures pour'd, Until the place was all alive With forms that swarm'd from hive to hive, Buzzing and murmuring every one In that soft lingo of the Sun! ‘Close to the flowery crag there clung A brown thatch'd roof with wild flowers hung, Supported on four sapling trees That pour'd sweet scents on the warm breeze, And underneath it, loosely wall'd With boughs as green as emerald, There lay a wide and open bower, A mossy nest of fruit and flower, With soft green hammocks swinging high To the wind's summer lullaby. Grass was the floor, but o'er it spread, Crumbling warm spice beneath the tread, Were woven carpets green and soft As the fresh blooms that swung aloft. Thither my captor, that sweet Maid Who held me in her sweet control, Led me, and, seated in the shade, My throne an old tree's mossy bole, I watch'd the throng who round me went In welcome and in merriment. ‘Possession's nine points of the law, Even yonder in the southern seas: And murmuring softly “Alohà!” (Which means “I love you,” if you please!) That Maid who was the first to capture My idle eyes with her strange beauty Gazed on my face in tender rapture And kiss'd my hand in sign of duty. Then, when some others, gladsome girls With sunny cheeks and teeth like pearls, Came thronging all around to view My face and give me welcome too, She waved them back with flashing eyes And seem'd to say (if looks could do it) “This man is mine! I claim the prize, And if you touch him, you shall rue it!” Smiling and laughing merrily, I just look'd on, content to be Appropriated for the present By one so young and plump and pleasant; And nodding, by my side I placed her, Patted her brown back and embraced her,— Whereon the happy native bands, Incapable of jealous spite, Laugh'd their approval, clapt their hands, And shared the little Maid's delight. ‘Then, at a signal from the Maid, They brought me poi, a native dish Of island grains and juices made, And stickier than one might wish— Her two forefingers lightly dipping Therein, she twirled them round about, Then drew a glutinous, slimy, dripping Mouthful, like macaroni, out; Next, quickly raised her finger-tips Thus coated to her rosy lips, Sucking them like a bonbon. while I watch'd her with a wondering smile. Ev'n thus she show'd me full of joy The native mysteries of poi— And presently, I made essay To eat it in the native way, And found the flavour of the stuff (Altho' the modus operandi Was strange and primitive enough) Was much like rice and sugar-candy. And next they brought in goblets green Of coca-shell a pleasant tipple As clear as mead or Hippocrene Or milk that flows from Venus' nipple; And quaffing this right joyously I felt my heart within throb quicker, For, like most sailors of the sea, I on occasion love good liquor! And thus they fêted me and fed me, And when at last I paused contented, To a green couch the Maiden led me, And down I sank on leaves sweet-scented;— When nimble virgins, at her sign, Kneaded me, limbs and loins and thighs, Till rack'd and rent I sank supine With aching frame and sleepy eyes,— And sank to charmèd sleep! (They name This swift shampooing of the frame The lomi-lomi.) When at last I woke, all sense seem'd sublimated, Bathed in a comfort deep and vast I lay like Adam new-created— Ambrosial peace and perfect rest Stole through my veins and warm'd me through, Serenely strong, completely blest, I gladden'd at each breath I drew; And all the world and its annoy Turn'd to an odorous rose of joy, Taking both soul and sense in capture With soft celestial folds of rapture! ‘Meantime her kinsfolk, blithe and gay As motes that in the sunbeam play, Simple as babies biting coral, Without one instinct known as moral, Eager to welcome and caress Whatever stranger they beheld, Full of the sunny happiness That from their dusky hearts up-well'd, Came smiling round the flowery nest Wherein I lay in blissful rest. Then one, an Elder of the place, A glad old boy with wrinkled face, Laugh'd and clapt hands, and at the sign All squatted down or lay supine, And from the shade of these dark bowers Outpour'd, with wondrous twists and twirls, Most lightly raimented in flowers A band of lissome Dancing Girls— These [while the rest began to croon A drowsy droning native tune], With gestures loose and looser raiment, With postures never for broad day meant, With panting mouths and shining eyes, With heaving breasts and quivering thighs, Began a measure which to see Would shock our modern modesty! A measure?—nay, a dance that knew No measure Thought could time it to— A leaping, eddying, unabating Revel of flesh and blood pulsating— Now soft and sweet as fountains falling, Now mad and wild as billows bounding, Now murmurous as wood-doves calling, Now corybantic and appalling, And changeful as it was astounding!’ Reflections on the margin, made In Rome, at a quite recent time, Follow, and tho' I'm half afraid To quote them, here they are, in rhyme: . . . ‘Aye me, what witchery may be wrought By soft round arms and looks of passion! What magic flooding sense and thought By limbs in beauteous undulation! Love rules the world, and Love shall rule it, Tho' rogues corrupt and sages fool it! Love moves the chessmen, Kings and Knights, And stirs the merest pawns as well, Hence change of empires, bloodiest fights, And all the game of Heaven and Hell. Herodias dances, and demands The Baptist's head as instant payment! Phryne just stirs her little hands, Lifting the edge of her light raiment, Glimpse of trim ankles to discover, And lo! a Dynasty is over! Were I the Devil, I'd rather deal With incantation such as this is, Than have great senates at my heel! Show me whole legions clad in steel— I'll rout them easily—with kisses! Kings for such guerdon will pay down Gladly the sceptre and the crown! Bishops their mitres and their crosiers For soft limbs beautified by hosiers! God gets no hearing anywhere While Womankind is fond and fair, And so the world is at the mercy Of the supreme enchantress, Circe! ‘Hartmann, whose page explains to us The creed of the Unconscious, By the Unconscious means the Power Which fills Life's Tree from root to flower. Pulsating out of yonder sunlight, Flowing in flame from form to form, Is the eternal Light, the one Light For ever wanton, wild, and warm,— Shedding magnetic rays of splendour, In ecstasies of new creation, Forcing all creatures to surrender To Love's amphibious invitation! Amœbæ in the ooze, and fishes, Beasts in the fields, birds in the air, Sweep whither the Unconscious wishes, And recreate forms foul or fair— All sing Natura Cumulans,— Nature, the Matronhood immortal— In vain le bon Dieu sits and plans Yonder beyond the heavenly portal, Crying like Canute, to the Ocean Of loose primordial mad emotion, “Thus far, no further”—while its waves, Beating the shore of human graves, Surging and rising, ever growing, Submerging earth from zone to zone, Drown Man's frail Soul, and overflowing Flood the bright Footstool of the Throne!’ Wide-eyed in wonder and delight The Wanderer drank in the sight— A Bacchic rite in emulation Of the first orgies of Creation! And when the dancers sank o'erpower'd With their own rapture, blossoms shower'd Upon them, and with flashing faces They clung in beautiful embraces. Then when the cup of joy was full Up to the brim and running over, Out of the darkness green and cool A girl coo'd clearly to her lover!— One bird-like note, one plaintive call, Passionate yet celestial, Thrill'd through the silence! then there came Out of the darkness, robed in white, With arms outstretch'd and eyes aflame, Alive with Love and Love's delight, That Flower of Maidens,—fair she stood Full in the sunset's crimson flood, And gazing on the heavens above Warbled her wondrous song of Love! And fascinated, thrilling through With bliss at every breath he drew, The Outcast listen'd, while the throng Were hushed to hear that Orphic song! But as he leapt to her embrace She laugh'd and vanish'd from his glance, And once again the leafy place Was loud with life and song and dance— Again, while loud the music rung, The choir of dancing girls upsprung, And mingling in the measure wrought Their fine gyrations passion-fraught! But now the dance was less capricious, The undulations more subdued,— Subsiding into throbs delicious, Faint rapture stealing through their blood, The maidens moved like one bright billow Now heavenward, now upon the ground, All swaying on an airy pillow And swooning with soft zones unbound, And spicy odours, burning beams, Blew round them as they rock'd in dreams, While on their happy cheeks and eyes Rain'd diamond dews from Paradise! A pause—a thrill—which seem'd to be. A long sweet dream of ecstasy— Then suddenly, before he knew, All vanish'd from his wondering view— Of all the throng not one was there, Men, women, maidens, turn'd to air, And lonely on his couch he lay Lit by the sunset's fading ray— But as he sigh'd and lookt around, He heard again that bird-like cadence And turning saw, with lilies crown'd, That tender miracle of maidens— Her eyes on his—one soft hand prest To still the billowing of her breast— Her cheeks all smiles, her eyes all bliss, Sending new thrills of rapture through him, Her mouth bent down for him to kiss, Her soul a votive offering to him! Then Twilight spread its purple fold Dew-spangled o'er the blue sky's bosom, And ripe and large as fruit of gold Great sun-fed stars began to blossom,— Such stars as never kindle save Out yonder o'er the tropic wave, Each like a little moon, and making In the smooth Ocean trails of light, While others, from the darkness breaking Like bursting fruit, shot seaward shaking Prismatic splendours through the night. As each new splendour flashed afar And melted in the quiet Main, It seem'd as if some shining star Had burst within the Wanderer's brain! And spicy scents of that green Land On the warm wind were wafted thither, As holding that dark Maiden's hand, Silent he sat, uplooking with her. Then sighing heavily, he turn'd His dark eyes shoreward, and discern'd The spume upon the reef that fell Like white milk from the coca-shell, The waters round of lustre green Alive with rays of starry sheen, And far off, on the water's bound, The Moon uprising large and round, Clear lemon-yellow, without rays, Out of the pathless ocean-ways! III. He turned his eyes on that sweet Maid, Who smiling in his face essay'd Quick eager speech of rippling words More musical than any singer's.— He guess'd the meaning of the words By the warm pressure of the fingers! Child-like she stood, with eyes of light Full of the happy tropic night, A white straw hat upon her head With ferns and flowers bright garlanded, Her dress one cool chemise of snow Wherein her soft form slipt at ease, Sleeveless, around the breasts cut low, And fluttering to the supple knees; Her limbs and arms all bare and warm, Her bosom gently palpitating,— Her face alive with Love, her form Thrill'd through with fires of Love's creating! Over that night now falls the veil! Earth held her breath. The stars grew pale Down-gazing. Heavenly balms were strewn On those two forms who 'neath the Moon Took Love's divine first kiss. The Night Linger'd above them in delight, Till softly and serenely blest, Still as two love-birds in a nest, They slept! . . . O Alohà! (which means ‘I love you,’ mind) delightful Maiden! Still in the daintiest of your teens, Yet woman-soul'd and passion laden! Through you, alas! I make this canto More warmly-colour'd than I want to! For I profess—let all men know it— To be a Psychologic Poet! Not that with solemn cogitations I mean to tire the reader's patience, Hair-splitting and refining ether Like some bards (and no small ones neither) Who show with philosophic hiccup The metaphysics in a teacup, And plummets deep as Death apply To gauge the depths of apple-pie! But aiming at the adumbration Of Nature's chaos of sensation, The more I of these Mysteries speak The more I pause with blushing cheek! Many will misconceive me; some Will just be thunderstruck and dumb That I should dream of spiritualising A subject which—there's no disguising— Is delicate extremely. Then I dread the Critics, those small men With those big voices! . . . Furthermore The days of passionate song are o'er, And now no Poet wins the laurel Who is not absolutely moral. We've had our fill of impropriety, Since Byron rose to shock Society, And of all moods by bards affected Anacreon's has been least neglected. The favourite Muses, Greek or British, Have ever been extremely skittish, And modern bards have drunk too wildly The warm Greek wine which Goethe mildly Sipt at while sketching with soft shade his Loose-laced, lax-moral'd German ladies; Gretchen, Philina, all the crew, Fleshly yet sentimental too, Sad sensuous things of scant decorum, Lost like the Magdalen before 'em, Save Mignon, who, as story teaches, Lack'd fat and so became the breeches. Then we've had Byron, that lame Cupid Of odalisques sublimely stupid, Not to name here Chateaubriand, Alfred de Musset, and George Sand, All watering with artistic squirt The flower of passion grown in dirt, Till Gautier made the Immortals flutter By rolling Venus in the gutter! But patience! this strange tale I tell Is high as Heaven, though deep as Hell, And in the end shall please the mind That's to analysis inclined; Shall show you, ere the last sad line, The great Eternal Feminine (Das Ewigweibliche, to wit, As amorous Wolfgang christen'd it), And vindicate its flights immodest Through scenes where Venus lies unbodiced, By flying on with fearless pinions To the clear air of God's dominions, That night, within their bower of bloom Flooded with moonlight and perfume, The Captain and his new-found treasure Drank deep of Love's o'erflowing measure, Then down the Unconscious sinking deep Floated on shimmering seas of Sleep. Wonder and hush miraculous! When, weary of her load of care, This Earth, whose fond arms shelter us, Feels softly on her brows and hair The cool dark dews of twilight fall Mysterious and celestial! Lo! while her golden robe of day Slips film by film and falls away, Naked and warm she stands a space, The sun-flush fading from her face: Then, with bow'd head and soft hands prest Upon her bare and billowing breast, Takes, while the chill Moon steals in sight, The cold ablution of the Night! And then, as by the pools of rest She lieth down subdued and blest, As on her closèd eyes are shed Dim influence from the heavens o'erhead, We nestling in her bosom close Our feverish eyelids and repose— Our spirits husht, our voices dumb, Our little lives a little still'd, We sleep!—and round us softly come Souls from whose fountains ours are fill'd! Spirits as soft as moonbeams flit Around our rest, not breaking it, Brushing across our lips and eyes Wings wet with dews of Paradise! While at God's mercy and at theirs We lie, they bless us unawares,— Watch the Soul's pool that lies within The branches dark of Flesh and Sin, And stir it as with Aaron's rod To gleams of Heaven and dreams of God! Lifting the filmy tent of Sleep With gentle fingers, on us peep Those errant angels, soft and tender With some strange starlight's dusky splendour; With balm from Heaven they bedew us, Bring flowers from Heaven and hold them to us, Flash on our eyes the diamonds shaken To fairy rainbows as we waken, And jubilantly ere departing Ring those wild echoes in our ears, Which, flusht and from our pillows starting, We hearken for with childish tears! If Dreams were not, if we could fall To slumber and not dream at all,— If when the eyes were closed, the sense Close shut, all seeing vanish'd thence, Why, 'twere not difficult to fancy This life no freak of necromancy,— And Man a clock, contrived to go (Bar breakage) seventy years or so, Yet running down and pausing nightly, Pendulum fluttering with no pain, Till, as the daydawn glimmers brightly, A Finger quickens it again! But Dreams, though sages think them silly, Attest us Spirits willy-nilly, And prove that, when the Unconscious glides Around us with its numbing tides, Shapes past conceiving or control Stir the dark cisterns of the Soul! All day God veils Himself in Light, But down the starry stairs each night He steals with solemn soundless tread And finds us—fast asleep, not dead! Ah, then begins the conjuration, The Mystery, the Incantation! The Feet Divine with soft insistence Plash through the Waters of Existence, Send strange electric thrills each minute Down to the very ooze within it, While, startled by the shining Presence, All Nature breaks to phosphorescence! . . . Now came the golden tropic Morning! Not like our dawns of chilly gloom: One glow, one crimson flash of warning, Then one great flood of blinding bloom— The world awoke and leapt—the Sea Flasht like a mirror radiantly— The leaves and flowers were all alive— A miracle of Light was done— And glad as bees from out the hive The people flock'd into the sun! Happy, contented, and serene, The Outcast left his nuptial bed, While blushing like a happy queen, His bride just kissed his lips and fled,— But soon tript back on lightsome feet With troops of maidens in her train, Bringing her lord fresh fruits to eat And cups of coca-milk to drain. Then gay and glad he sought the strand And stript, and plung'd into the tide, And, striking strongly out from land In pools of Dawn beatified, He heard a rippling laugh, and turning Saw her behind him, swimming too— Her dusky face upon him yearning Baptized with joy and morning dew! That was the Dawn, the bright beginning Of one long day of Love's delight! Happy, unconscious she was sinning, His slave by day, his bride by night, She, with her people's acquiescence, Said in Love's language, ‘I am thine,’ And happy in her constant presence He lived and loved and felt divine! And ah! what wonder he was glad, That all his soul grew iridescent, Forgot the past so dark and sad, With such a Bride for ever present? Soft almond eyes of starry splendour, Lips poppy-red, teeth white as pearls, A warm brown cheek sun-tan'd and tender,— The nicest, nakedest of girls! Her form from shoulder down to foot Like Cupid's bow a splendid curve, Her flesh as soft as ripen'd fruit Yet quick with quivering pulse and nerve— Her limbs, like those of some fair statue, Perfectly rounded, strong yet slight, Her childish glance, when smiling at you, Alive with luxury of light! O happy he whose head could rest Upon that warm and bounteous breast, And so ecstatically capture Its tropic indolence of rapture! How darkly, passionately fair She seem'd when, resting by him there Upon a couch of leaves sweet-scented, She smiled without a single care, And took no kiss that she repented, And knew no thought he could not share. And when he wearied with the light Shed on his dazzled soul and sight, Still as a bird within the nest She saw his dark eyes close in rest; And lay beside him fondly waiting, Obedient as a happy child, Watching his face, and palpitating Till he awoke again and smiled! For all her pleasure was to trace The happiness upon his face, To feel his breath flow warmly thro' her, To kiss his hands and draw them to her, And place them on her heart, that he Might feel it leaping happily! And ever springing from his side, She brought him fruit and dainties sweet, And knelt beside him, happy-eyed To see her Lord and Master eat— And if he frown'd her face grew very Sad; if he laugh'd, her face grew merry; So every shade of his emotion Pass'd to her face and faithful eyes, As shadows of the summer Ocean Answer the changes of the Skies! A Rose with Dawn's cool dew and savour Renew'd at every kiss he gave her, A Blush Rose passionately scented, Serene, unconscious, and contented, She felt soft airs of Heaven bedew her, And drank their sweetness deep into her, Kept Soul and Body, through light and glooming, One Flower for ever freshly blooming! O happy Life! O blissful Passion! Far from Life's folly and Life's fashion! Far from the tailor and the hatter! Far from the clubs and criticasters! Far from all metaphysic patter, From all cold creeds of God and Matter, From silly sheep and sillier pastors! No Parliaments, to lying given— No paupers, and no governing classes— No books, or newspapers, thank Heaven! And no god Jingo for the masses! O happy Life, without a trouble! Pure and prismatic as a bubble, Fresh as a flower with dewdrops pearl'd,— Ere naked Truth rose, with a wink, Black from her Well (of printer's ink) Or out of chaos woke the World! IV. Pause, Moral Reader, ere you scold A Bard that seemeth overbold, And grasp the truth that I who sing Am like my Hero wandering Outlaw'd and lost! Let me commend you, Moreover, should the theme offend you, To realise that he whose tale I tell was ‘damn'd’ (right justly too),— Forgetting this, you'll wholly fail To gain the proper point of view. For your assistance, I'll again Quote from the Notebook, thus translating: ‘How peaceful, after all the pain Of endless doubting and debating! How restful, after stormy grief, This quiet of the lotus-leaf! And yet, and yet! how Memory flashes Her mirror in my sleepy eyes, While darkly on my drooping lashes The tear-drops linger as they rise! I mark the Land where I was born, The red-tiled Town beside the sea,— The Mother who awakes at morn And turns to give her kiss—to me! I walk along the sun-brown'd sands, I gather sea-shells in my hands, I run and sport till death of day, Then kneeling by my cot, I pray. . . Again I am a fisher-lad, I haul the net, I trim the sail, I whistle to the winds, right glad To hear the gathering of the gale. Then sailing homeward tan'd and brown I watch the red lights of the Town Gleam blur'd and moist thro' mist and rain, While down the anchor merrily goes again! I leap on land, run up the shore, Eager to gain my home once more, And startle with a boy's delight The widow'd Mother waiting there! Almighty God! that night, that night! Ev'n now it chokes me with despair! For lo, I see the thin white form Stretch'd on the bed in ghastly rest, The lips clay cold that once were warm, The frail hands folded on the breast— Mother! my mother! even now, I bend and kiss thy marble brow, The boy's heart breaks, the salt tears flow, And the great Storm of human Woe Sweeps round the quick and dead!—Aye me, That first great grief, the worst of all! That first despair and agony, To which all later woes seem small! ‘Then first I knew Thee, God! whose breath Is felt in pestilence of Death! Then first I knew Thee whom men bless And found Thee blind and pitiless! I knew and lived—for 'twas Thy will Only to torture, not to kill— And so the torn heart heal'd at last, And I survived, but not the same— And ere the sense of sorrow pass'd The life within me broke to flame Of Youth's first love!—and I forgot The woe which is our mortal lot, Because a maiden's face was fair, Because a maiden's lips were sweet,— She bound me with her golden hair And threw me captive at her feet. Then, the glad wooing! The new birth Of man and God, of Heaven and Earth, When softly, thro' the shades of night We stole and watch'd the evening star, While faint and distant, flashing white, Waves murmur'd from the harbour bar. How good Thou wast, Almighty One, Blessing my troth, the maiden's vow! But ere another year was done I curst Thee, as I curse Thee now. For lo, Thine Angel Death pass'd by, With flaming finger touched her breast— Scarce woman yet, too young to die, She sicken'd of a vague unrest, Till on her lips clung day by day The blood-phlegm ever wiped away By the thin kerchief, while she tried To force the smile that fought with tears— God, hear my curse once more!—She died,— But still, across the raging years, Her wan face rises, to proclaim Her Maker's infamy and shame! ‘Pass all the rest!—My Soul knew then The hourly martyrdom of men, And turn'd in very impotence To books for comfort, gathering thence (For they had taught me how to read) The lies and lusts of every creed. Then, an old Scribe, who loved to pore On pages of forbidden lore, Gave me, for service gently done, The knowledge that I long'd to gain, Good soul!—he used me like his son, And made me erudite and vain. Four years of this, in Rotterdam, Combin'd with studies less improving, And I became the thing I am, Worn with much thinking and much loving, For in that City women were As bountiful as they were fair. Then, suffering from an accidental Complaint to lovers detrimental, I passed some time, just for variety, 'Mong doctors in the Hospital— Then, tired of land and she-society, Cried “Curse the women! one and all!” And off again I went, as sailor Before the mast, upon a Whaler. “Gentleman Phil” they had me christen'd, For I could curse in French and Greek, And merrily the rascals listen'd When I discoursed, with tongue in cheek, On men and women, God and Matter, And all things wicked and unclean! Lord, how they loved my learnèd patter, My blasphemies and jokes obscene! ‘Long after, came my Luck. Despairing Of gaining much by pure seafaring, I join'd some honest men and brothers Who robbed upon the Wet Highway, And being cleverer than the others I gathered gold, as rascals may— Grown rich, I earn'd their approbation By deeds accurst they dared not do, And being skill'd in navigation, And of some little education, Became the Captain of the crew. By Heaven and Hell, those days were merry! We knew no pity, felt no fear,— Devils that played at hey down derry With all that honest men hold dear! Nor were the smiles of Venus wanting, For many a fat ship was our prize, And many a woman most enchanting Struck her red blush-flag, and sank panting Under our fire of amorous eyes. . . . Ah deeds accurst! Do I repent? Perhaps a little, now and then! But what was God about, who sent Things that were pure and innocent To be the spoil of beast-like men?’ Much in this not too pious vein The crimson leaves o' the Book contain— Much, too, of scenes which would have staggered Jules Verne or Mr. Rider Haggard, So full they were of wind and water, Clangour of swords, and general slaughter. But presently we find him pining To slip his fetters and be free, On beds of amaranth reclining With eyes upon the turquoise sea. ‘So, as I've said, or just suggested, I, the crass Outcast of the Lord, Seeking salvation (as requested), In that first Haven snugly nested, Was rapidly becoming bored. The Honeymoon, I've always thought, Is a mistake! I'd tire, I swear, If in the net of Wedlock caught, Of Venus' self, the ever Fair! No, 'tis the wooing and the winning, Not the long end, but the beginning, That is the joy of Love!—Mere courting Passes all amorous disporting, And what we crave contains a blessing We never compass in possessing! Some men, I grant (not damn'd like me) Are arm'd so strong in purity, That wedlock is an endless boon, And life one long-drawn Honeymoon,— And these appease their modest wishes As peacefully as jelly-fishes, And floating flaccid 'neath the sky Tamely increase and multiply. But these are fish-like things, not Lovers, Spawn of the pools, not Ocean rovers, Lives drifting where the currents choose, Or sunk in matrimonial ooze. Moreover, I who write had sown My wild oats early, and had known All kinds of pleasure, long before My rotten Barque set out from shore. And when the Master of Creation, Or some blind Force, His adumbration, Gave me the chance to find salvation Somewhere on earth,—I steered despairing To this soft Eden in the seas, And nothing hoping, nothing caring, Thought “Here at least I'll rest at ease!” Not to the Cities did I wander, Not to the Schools where pedants ponder, Not to the tents of Civilisation, But back, straight back, to nude Creation!— And here I found the general Mother Beauteous and bounteous, warm and wild, And from her heart, like many another, I drank Life's milk, a happy child. My blessing on her! Grand and free, Untainted with morality, With but one Law of life and pleasure To render her supremely blest, She gives me all she hath, full measure Of that great Milky Way, her Breast— Yet though I linger here, replete As any flower with all that's sweet, I often long to be once more A foam-fleck blown from shore to shore!’ A ‘London’ Note.—‘How faint to-day Seems all that Eden far away! Ev'n then that life, such as the pure hope To find at last beyond the sky, Was far removed from life in Europe And all the scandal and the cry Of life in Cities!—People there Were naked babies sucking corals, Spent blissful days without a care, Had no idea what morals were, And so—were innocent of morals. Since then the Gospel has been spread there, And divers bad complaints been shed there, And Civilisation's boisterous busy hum Has quite destroyed that sweet Elysium. Soon, if the natives keep progressing, They'll turn to Scandal for variety, Receive the new god Jingo's blessing, Become æsthetic in their dressing, And have their Journals of Society!’ Another, blasphemous and fierce.— ‘Oft, when I think of that fair place, I front the heavens and seek to pierce, O God, Thy cloudy hiding-place. For mark, ev'n there, unseen by me, Thy Deputies, Disease and Death, Were crawling snake-like from the sea To taint pure Nature with their breath. There, tangled in Thy mesh of woes, Tortured and stain'd the Leper rose, And join'd his wail to all the cries That from the host of martyrs rise High as Thy Throne! Tell me, Thou God, Who, striking Chaos with Thy rod, Creating Heaven, and Earth, and Flood, Praised Thine own work and call'd it “good,” Tell me, O God, if God Thou art, Doth Thy Hand rend the breaking heart? In beasts and men, doth it adjust The Hate of Hate, the Lust of Lust, And blotch Thy work, Humanity, With these foul stains of Leprosy! What art Thou, God, if this be so? What is the glory Thou dost claim?— Thy tribute is eternal woe, Thy pride eternal Death and shame! I toss the gage to Thee again! Unfold Thyself, defend Thy plan,— Or own Thy primal work was vain, And let Thy tears descend like rain To attest Thy sin at making Man! ‘We feel too much, we know too little, We gaze behind us and before; The magic wand of Faith, grown brittle, Breaks in our grasp; our Dream is o'er! Wakening at last, we understand The World's no pretty Fairyland, No sonny World with gods above it, No happy World with God to love it, But a worn World whose first sweet prayer Is turned to darkness and despair— A World without a God!— ‘O Mother, We cling to thee with feeble cries, Fight for thy breast with one another, Or wondering watch thy sightless eyes Upturn'd to Heaven!—O Mother Earth, Still fair and kind as at thy birth, Still tender yet forlorn, as when Out of thy womb the race of men Came crying—with the same sad cry That haunts thee while they droop and die! Sad as the Sphinx, and blind! for thou Hast look'd once on the Father's face, Hast felt His kiss upon thy brow, Hast quicken'd, too, in His embrace, Till blind with light of Deity That clasp'd thee and was mix'd with thee, Thine eyes for ever ceased to see; And night by night and day by day Patiently thou dost grope thy way, Clasping thy children, heavenward, In search of Him who comes no more— O Mother! patient! evil-star'd! Who now shall be Thy stay and guard, Now that first Dream of Love is o'er? ‘Thy children babble of green fields! Thy youth and maidens, gladly crying, Suck all the sweets that Nature yields, And lie i' the sun, as I am lying! They learn the raptures of the sense, Break Love's ripe virgin gourd and thence Drink the fresh waters of delight . . . What then? To-morrow Death and Night Shall find them, or if Death denies The boon which closes weary eyes, Despair more dire than Death shall come To linger o'er their martyrdom! O Mother! martyred too!—yet blest To feel the new-born at thy breast, What of thy Dead? What of the prayers Taught them of old to still their cares? What of the promise fondly given Of comfort, and a Father in Heaven? There is no God! there is no Father! And that which clasp'd thee, mother Earth, Was formless, voiceless, monstrous, rather Than gracious and of heavenly birth— The attributes we take from thee Are bright and fair, tho' only clay,— The living force that keeps us free, The joy of Life, the bliss of Day! What we inherit from the Sire Is formless, passionless, and dim, Deep dread, despair, unrest, desire To climb the heavens and gaze on Him! Ah, hopeless and eternal quest! Ah, Life so sweet! so fugitive! Dear Mother, endless sleep is best, But ere we close our eyes in rest We loathe the Power which made us live. ‘What mercy hast Thou, Father? None, Even for Thine own Belovèd Son, Who weeping sadly, drinking up The poison of Thy hemlock cup, While the rude rocks and clouds were shaken, And even Thine angels sobbed in pain, Cried, “Eloi, why am I forsaken?” And dying, sought Thy Face in vain! . . Reveal that Face!—Uplift Thy veil, O God, and show Thyself, that we Who struggling upward faint and fail May know Thy lineaments and Thee! Thou canst not, for Thou art not!—I Have never found in sea or sky One living token that Thou art, One semblance of a Father's heart, One look, one touch to attest Thy claim To godhead and a Father's name!’ Bright crimson was the blood wherein Those words were written down! ‘My sin Falls like a garment to my feet, Naked I front Thy Judgment Seat, Veil'd Maker of the World. Thy Word Breath'd on the darkness, and it stirred And lived—for what? That Man might rise With hopeless heaven-searching eyes, Clothed in Thy likeness? Thine?—the Form No man hath seen, no man may know, A Phantom riding on the Storm While Earthquake rends the earth below; While like a hawk that hunts its prey Death, creeping on from plain to plain, Tortures the Human night and day, Wounds what 'twere pitiful to slay, And scatters Pestilence and Pain. I tell thee, one poor human thing, One little suffering lamb, one frail Form of Thy cruel fashioning, Refutes the Lie which cries “All Hail, Father Almighty!” ‘Mighty? No! Weaker than we who come and go Erect and proud, whose deeds approve A human brotherhood of love. Our love and hate have aims, but thine Are idle bolts at random hurl'd; Impotent, hidden, yet Divine, Brood o'er thy broken-hearted World!’ My last quotation (for the present), Though far less fierce, is still unpleasant: ‘Pictor Ignotus! Power Unseen! Who imn'd this sight whereon I gaze,— The still blue Seas, the arc serene Of yon still Heavens of radiant sheen, I doff my hat and give Thee praise! Thy skill in painting this green Earth, The forms upright that seem divine, Proclaim Thy most exceeding worth— No technique, Master, equals Thine! Step forward, then, O great Unknown, Accept our humble admiration!— All men of taste will gladly own The excellence of Thy Creation! A beauteous bit of work like this Whereon I feast mine eyes this morning, All peace, all prettiness, all bliss, Hushes at once all doubt, all scorning. Tell me, Great Master, did'st Thou make This thing for the mere Beauty's sake, Having no other test to measure Thy work, but pure æsthetic pleasure? If this be so, why do we see Elsewhere, attributed to Thee, So many things which, I opine, Are really coarse and Philistine? Another question, which concerns The æsthetic spirit. Many hold, However bright and clear it burns, 'Tis selfish, passionless, and cold; Indifferent to the means whereby It gains the artistic end in view, It broods alone, with cruel eye That keeps the handcraft sure and true. If this be so, and Thou, O great Master, art but a craftsman fine, I understand and estimate (At last) Thy process, called “Divine”— Cold to the prayer of human sorrow, Deaf to the sob of human strife, Thou workest grandly, night and morrow, On Thy great Masterpiece of Life! For Thine own pleasure is it done, Since Art's delight is in the doing, Thine own enjoyment, slowly won, Is the sole end Thou art pursuing— No dull despairing criticaster Troubles Thee or disturbs Thee, Master! No thought of human approbation Perturbs Thy rapture of creation! No sound of breaking hearts can reach Thee, No touch of tears Thy sense can thrill, Tho' millions praise Thee or beseech Thee, Indifferent Thou labourest still; Picture on Picture is destroyed, And thrown into the empty void; World upon world is made, and then Rejected gloomily again; Life upon life is painted fair, Then tost aside in Art's despair; And so, with blunders infinite, Thou toilest for Thine own delight! ‘And when Thy task is done, when Art Crowns to the full Thy great endeavour, Alone, Unknown, still sit apart, And glory in Thy work for ever!’ V. There, where eternal Summer lingers, The Isle lay golden 'neath the blue, Save when the Rain's soft tremulous fingers Just touch'd its eyes with cool dark dew,— Or when with sudden thunderous cry The chariots of the clouds went by, And trembling for a little space, The Isle lay down with darken'd face Under the vials of the Storm, Then shook the sparkling drops away And looking upward felt the warm New sunlight gladdening thro' the grey! Like a child's heart that beats so gladly, So full of joy for Life's own sake, Did not the sudden tears flow madly A moment's space, 'twould surely break,— So did that Land of Summer capture Just now and then surcease from rapture! But after storms, the bliss grew finer, And storms indeed were far between,— The days divine, the nights diviner, With peace celestial and serene. From dawn to dark the golden Light Dwelt on green cape and gleaming height, On yellow sands where the blue Sea Pencil'd in silvern filagree Frail flowers and leaves of frost-white spray That ever came and flash'd away. Then, the deep nights! great nights of calm, Full of ambrosial bliss and balm! Smooth sun-stain'd waves as daylight fled Broke on the reef to foam blood-red, Till the white Moon arose, and lo! The foam was powdery silver snow, And slowly, softly, down the night, O'er the smooth black and glistering Sea, The starry urns of crystal Light Were fill'd and emptied momently! Then in the centre of the glimmer The round Moon ripen'd as she rose, And cover'd with the milk-white shimmer The glassy Waters took repose; And round the Isle a murmur deep Of troubled surges half asleep Broke faintlier and faintlier As Midnight took her shadowy throne; In heaven, on earth, no breath, no stir, No sound, save that deep slumb'rous tone! Wonder of Darkness!—'neath its wing All living things sank slumbering, Save those glad lovers in delight Clinging and gazing at the sky, While phosphorescent thro' the night Portents of Nature glimmer'd by! In such dark hours of stillness Love Reaches her apogee of bliss; The fountains of the spirit move Upward, and cresting to a kiss Sink earthward sighing—then we seem Creatures of passion and of dream, Ethereal shadowy things whose breath May touch the cheeks of happy Death, Who smile, and sigh for joy, and fall Into deep rest celestial! Such joy I've had on autumn eves When the Moon shines on slanted sheaves, And thro' the distant farmhouse pane The lighted candle flashes red, And darker over field and lane The gloaming of the night is shed. Then, pillow'd on a warm white breast, And gazing into happy eyes, While the faint flush of radiance blest Still came and went on the dark skies, I've felt the dim Earth softly spinning On its smooth axle, while above The bright stars as at Time's beginning Turn'd in their spheres of Light and Love;— O joy of Youth! O adumbration Of Hope and ecstasy intense! When Life's faint stir, Love's first pulsation, Turn to a splendour dazzling sense! One night like that were more to me, Now I am weary with Earth's ways, Than all a long Eternity Of strident, garish, gladsome days! Ah, to be young! ah, once again To drink Youth's wild and wondrous wine! To quit the pathos and the pain For passionate hours of joy divine! To feel the breast that comes and goes While fond white arms around me twine, To feel the ripe mouth like a rose Prest close, with kiss on kiss, to mine! To feel all Nature thus fulfil Her gladness in that touch of lips, Which cling and cling and cling and thrill One Soul to the soft finger-tips,— All this, which I can ne'er express, This flush of Youth and Happiness, Methinks, is infinitely nicer Than being counted good or clever— Than growing every day preciser And finding Love has flown for ever! For ever? No!—Thank God, the power Of Love can move me to this hour; And tho' my moonlight pranks are over, And those old sheaves are shed like sleet, I'll be a Poet and a Lover Until my heart doth cease to beat! Yet there are nobler things than pleasure, Diviner things than Flesh can gain,— Insight too deep for joy to measure Comes with supremacy of pain!— When kneeling by the Dead and seeing That still white Lily with shut eyes, We feel, stirred to the depths of Being, The pathos of poor human ties. If in that awful trysting place, We watch, thro' tears that blindly roll, Pale Love and shadowy Death embrace And blend to one eternal Soul, How feeble, of how little worth, Seem all those ecstasies of Earth! Out of corruption and decay Spring flowers that cannot pass away— Out of a grief transcending tears Springs radiance that redeems our lot, While faintly on our listening ears Rings the soft music of the spheres, ‘Forget me not! forget me not!’ Shall we forget? Shall Death not be The gauge of our Humanity? Shall Love and Death, one Soul, one Thought, Not waft us upward as on wings? Almighty God, our life were naught, Were this dark Miracle ne'er wrought To prove us spiritual things. Dust to the dust—there let it lie! Soul to the Soul—which cannot die! The dim white Dove of Death is winging O'er Life's great flood in lonely flight, That sad black leaf of olive bringing To prove a hidden Land of Light! God, who created Earth and Heaven, Lord of the Dead Thy love can save, Thy Bow still comforts the bereaven While Death wings on from wave to wave! Standing 'neath Sorrow's sunless pall We hail a symbol bright and blest, And by that sign know one and all That when these troubled Waters fall Our Ark on Ararat shall rest! . . . . So the sweet days stole on, and still The Outcast wandered at his will From dream to dream, from bliss to bliss, Glad and unconscious of his doom; His thought, a smile—his life, a kiss— His breath and being, one perfume! But even as the Snake once stole Unseen, unguess'd, to Eden's Bowers, Ennui, the Serpent of the Soul, Crept in deep-hid 'neath fruit and flowers! Slowly the ecstasy intense Fever'd the life of Soul and Sense, And certain of delight the eyes Grew weary of the happy Skies, And looking up into his face, Her only Heaven, the Maid could trace, Ere he himself was yet aware, The filmy clouds of nameless care! Sometimes he'd sit wrapt deep in thought, His gaze upon the glassy Sea; Sometimes from sleep his passion-fraught Spirit would wake him suddenly! Sometimes, on days of summer rain, When gentle storms swept round the land, He paced the shores, and seemed again Upon the wave-tost deck to stand! And wistful as a hound, that lies Watching its master's face, and tries To share his sorrow or delight, The Maiden mark'd him day and night! ‘This is the worst of Joy—the more We bask’ (he writes) ‘beneath its ray, The sooner is the magic o'er, The quicklier doth it fade away! Sunshine without a cloud at all Of its own peace begins to pall, And calm too tropic and intense Soon fevers to indifference! Whence little rain-clouds, tempests even, Keep Hymen's garden green and growing, And lovers weary of a Heaven Where no rain falls, no wind is blowing! One sickens of fine weather, tires Of ever-gratified desires, Is bored, although at first enchanted, By having every fancy granted. And ah! my little Maid, unskill'd In any art of the coquette, All love, all rapture, sweetly filled With the warm wine her soul distilled, Incapable of fear or fret, Ne'er knew what women more capricious Learn, with long culture for a guide,— That joy is render'd more delicious By being now and then denied. How could a Passion-Flower, all scent, All bloom, and all abandonment, Appreciate the subtle ways Which wiser modern women show forth? Such dainty tricks came in with stays, Flounces, and pantalettes, and so forth,— Whence we our Modern Venus see, Not in immortal nudity, But veil'd in beauteous mystery! But Love in that bright Land abode Almost in mother-nakedness, Pure Nature all her beauties showed Indifferent to the arts of Dress: No Milliner had wander'd thither, Bearing Parisian magic with her:— The skirt's sly folds, the robe's disguises, The pruderies of silken hose, The roguish petticoat's surprises, The thousand spells that Art devises To veil the secrets of the Rose! That Child of Sunlight never guess'd How winsome and how fair may be A modern Maiden bravely drest In opalescent modesty! The scented form that shrinks away At the first look of tenderness, The faltering tongue that murmurs “nay,” Belying eyes that answer “yes,” The flying feet a lover chases, The half-withdrawn, half lingering hand, The breast that heaves 'neath creamy laces Craving yet shrinking from embraces, Were all unknown in that sweet Land!’ And so, already, as I've told, The fabled Snake was crawling there, Since he who trod those shores of gold Had brought it with him unaware!— For worldly knowledge and its pride Tainted the man's dark nature thro', And as they wandered side by side, Lonely as Adam and his bride, Under those skies of Eden's blue, He often watched her in the mood Of modern Bards and Heroes, saying: ‘True, she is beautiful and good, As fine a thing of flesh and blood As ever loved or went a-Maying. She recognises, too, completely The privilege of her master Man, And, ever fond and smiling sweetly, Supplies his needs, as Woman can. She is the instrument placed by me To calm, perhaps to purify, me! And I, of course, in this affair, Fit object of her daily prayer, Am the one person whose salvation God takes into consideration! I am the Hero—I am clearly The object of His circumspection, And she, although I love her dearly, Is but a means to my perfection.’ And so, like other cultivated Dunces by Folly sublimated, He took that angel's fond and true Homage as if it were his due! A Hero!—he! Now God confound him, And all such Heroes great or small— The crown of pride with which Love crown'd him Was but a Fool's cap after all! VI. Heroes? The noblest and the best Are those of whom we never know; God's Greatest are God's Lowliest, Who move unnoted to their rest Nor build their pride on human woe. Napoleons of Sword or Song, The proud, the radiant, and the strong, The inheritors of Earth, are clay To the slain Saints of every day. The Kings of Action and of Thought Pass in their pride and leave no sign, But the slain Martyr's flesh is wrought By suffering to Life divine. In the eternal Judge's sight This truth refutes the common lie: What men call Genius hath no right To scorn one single human tie. Come up, ye Poets, and be tried! Stand up, you shrieking, mouthing throng! Shall you be spared and justified For a few scraps of selfish song? By Heaven, the weary world could spare All poets since Creation's day, If one poor human heart's despair, One poor lost Soul's unheeded prayer, Must be the price it hath to pay! Bury your Homers mountain-deep, Strangle your Shakespeares ere they wake, If they their heritage must keep, If they Parnassus-ward must creep O'er souls they stain and hearts they break. For what is Verse, and what is Fame? Great reams of paper, much acclaim! And what are Poets at the best But busy tongues that often bore us? One noble heart, one loving breast Is worth the whole long-winded chorus! But hold! true Poesy keeps ever Great wisdom as its pearl of price; The sleepless Dream, the long Endeavour, The questioning Thought that resteth never, Demand no living sacrifice. Your Goethe's pyramid was made Of broken hearts and lives betrayed, Wherefore men found it, when complete, A pyramid of Self-conceit. And take your Shelley (tho' I hold The fellow had a harp of gold): He stained the Soul he had to save The day he turn'd from Harriet's grave. But leave me Burns, and Byron too,— They had their faults, and those not few, And gave the nations much offence By riot and concupiscence, But Love was in the rogues! they paid Full dearly for the pranks they played, And never, in their wildest revel, Pleaded the privilege of Fame, Or called on Genius and the Devil To justify their guilt and shame! Some men, all women, worship Strength: Carlyle did, till experience taught him That even the athlete pays at length The bills that Time and Death have brought him. Rough Thomas loudly preached for long That hero-worship of the Strong, The right of muscle and of sinew To use the weak and crush the small, ‘Do something! show the spirit in you, Work, in God's name!’ men heard him call. ‘Speech, sirs, is silvern—silence gold!’ He cried aloud with lungs of leather; Nay, even when wearied out and old He could not keep his tongue in tether. Friedrich, Napoleon, Mirabeau, Danton and Goethe were his crazes! They stood like puppets in a row, Tall spectres of a wax-work show, While lustily he shrieked their praises. Meantime the bleeding Christ went by, And heard the acclaim in Cheyne Walk, Heard from the threshold, with a sigh, The creed of Silence proved by Talk, And passing slowly on, footsore, Left on the noisy Prophet's door The mark of Passover, for token A Lamb must die, a life be broken. 'Twas done, and in a little space, Silent at last as in a tomb, The Prophet, tears on his worn face, Sat old and lonely in the gloom How did his Heroes help him then? What word had Friedrich, Mirabeau, Napoleon, and the mighty men He glorified with tongue and pen, To assuage the tempest of his woe? Old Hurricane, I hated thee When, shrieking down Humanity, High as a Dervish thou upleapt,— But in thine hour of agony, I could have kissed thy wounds and wept. The pity! ah, the pity of it! Well, Life is piteous at the best. Thou wast most mighty, poor old Prophet, When weakest, saddest, silentest! Tho' all the gods were dead, and He, The great God, who is One in Three, ‘Did naught’ (at least in thy opinion, Though thou did'st cry His Name so loud) Though Belial reigned in His dominion And led the many-headed crowd, Yet supernatural Shapes of Fear, Fiend-like or god-like, pass'd thee by, And Froude, thy Nemesis, was near With watchful biographic eye. Heir to thy weariness and folly, He warm'd thy night-cap, brought thy gruel, Sat by thine arm-chair, melancholy, And fed thy fantasy with fuel. And now across the earth he passes, Babbling of thee and Parson Lot, And serves up tepid for the masses Thy gospel, once so piping hot; Feeds little strong men with his praise, Just as you fed the strong and great, Bewails the dark degenerate days, The dreadful Democratic craze, The shipwreck of our ancient State; Longs for another Drake (or gander), Of whom in Eyre he saw some traces, Some rough, swashbuckler, bold commander, To govern the inferior races; Thro' the colonial seas careering Avers philanthropies are vile, And rests, forlornly pamphleteering, The Peter Patter of Carlyle. Man is most godlike, I affirm, Not when he seeks to top the skies, And peer, poor evanescent Worm, Into the heavenly Sphinx's eyes, Not when he vainly tries to patter Of Gods and heroes, Mind and Matter, Or cries, with folly sublimated, ‘Lo, I am first of things created,’ Or flapping further leaden-bodied Assumes a legislative godhead;— But when, in tears, he humbly kneeling Prays in the silence of the night, Knows himself blind, and dimly feeling With frail arms upward, craves for Light! Then, from without or from within, Comes in that solemn silent hour The miracle which turns his sin To hope, to insight, and to power! Then comes the Voice from far away, Saying: ‘My love shall be thy guerdon! Be of good heart, poor thing of clay, Soon shall I turn thy night to day, And free thy Soul from flesh, its burden!’ He listens, breaks to tears, and straightway Feels this rough load of bone and brawn Grow lighter, sees a heavenly Gateway Swing on its hinges far withdrawn, Revealing glimpses bright and blest Of good old-fashion'd Realms of Rest,— The Heaven which all his kin have sighed for, Which bards have dreamed of, martyrs died for, Which Christ the Master postulated, Which every creed hath pictured there, Which Death itself hath adumbrated Out of the cloud of Life's despair! Dear foolish Creed! sweet Superstition! Fair childish Dream, now faded wholly! By men of brains and erudition Despised as ignorance and folly! Humanity, the wise inform us, Is intellectua, or naugn, And Heroes, wondrous and enormous, Have soared to thrones of godlike thought, Attesting that Humanity By its own seed redeemed may be, And that the Titans of each nation May face the Saturn of Creation. For ‘God’—if there be God at all— Does nothing (that's the Chelsea teaching!) And to be weak and frail and small, To reach up arms and feebly call On some veil'd Nurse, in blind beseeching, Is just to forfeit altogether The privilege of Adam's seed!— ‘No, if in Nature's stormy weather, You'd find a foothold and a creed, A light, a buckler, an example, A sign to swear by (or to swear at), Find out some Hero strong and ample Who on your neck hath strength to trample, Crying, “Qui meruit palmam ferat!” Follow that form the small birds sing to, O'er fields of slain the vultures wing to, While women wail and warriors revel! Since you can find no God to cling to, Worship some proud heroic Devil!’ . . . Well, to my Tale—for I'm digressing Most damnably, and space is pressing. At times, indeed, despite the curse Of Knowledge in him, my poor Hero, Lord of his own Soul's universe, Yet lone as Lapland, low as zero, Felt childishly beatified, Foolishly pious, tried to gulp a Tear of repentance down, and cried— ‘Lord of the meek, forgive my pride, O mea culpa! mea culpa!’ For even a Hero, one who deems Himself the centre of Creation, Who, proud of God's attention, beams With self-approving admiration, Is only clay! A great philosopher Will often whimper on the sly, And sceptics often try to cross over The Bridge of Prayers that spans the Sky. On moonlight nights, on Sabbath days, When Earth herself lies still and prays Rock'd in the sad Sea's quiv'ring arms, And God's Hand, laid upon her breast, 'Mid folds of trembling darkness, charms Her fears to momentary rest, All creatures, proud or lowly, share That dusky rapture of despair! And now the Outcast who had sneer'd At all the schemes of Earth and Heaven, Who fear'd no wrath or tempest, feared The peace, the joy, which God had given! And gazing in that Maiden's eyes Full of soft love and sad surmise, He saw a starry radiance shine That show'd him base, and her divine! Ah, then he could have prayed, and wept, Humble, and low, and spirit-sore— But the mood pass'd, and o'er him crept The cankering curse of pride once more. Yet those were happy, happy days! 'Twas Eden tho' the Snake was there! Eternal Summer shed its rays O'er these still seas, thro' these green ways, And all was primitive and fair! Life grew so still and softly sweet The rapturous heart scarce seemed to beat, And sense and spirit seem'd to swoon To the hot hush of one long Noon; Sometimes thro' forest paths of green They walk'd, and thro' the leafy sheen O'erhead, beheld the bright skies grow Miraculously white, like snow; Or to some grotto's shade they came And saw with slimy weeds o'ergrown Some carven god without a name Sit in the chillness all alone, And on her face the little Maid Fell for a space and softly prayed, Then dipt her finger tips into The cool green drops of sunless dew That on the idol dript and fell, And laid them on her lover's brow, And seem'd to say, ‘Love, all is well— He gives us both his blessing now!’ Sometimes upon the peaceful Sea They paddled out in light canoes, And floating softly, silently, O'er deep cool voids of rainbow hues, Saw far below them, far as was The mirror'd heaven as smooth as glass, Thro' soft translucent depths of dream, Down, down, within the clear abysm, Bright creatures of the Ocean gleam And fade, like colours in the prism;— There, rocked on crystal waves that were As clear and shadowless as air, They seem'd suspended near the sun Between two Heavens that throb'd as one! Sometimes they climb'd the peaks, and stood Full in the moonlight's amber glood, And saw the great stars as bright as gold Steal breathless from the azure fold, And like strange luminous living things Move to their silent pasturings; And down beneath them, far as gaze Could see into the ocean-ways, Such shapes as in a mirror shone, And softly pasturing too, crept on! And all around them on the heights Eternity set beacon-lights, And meteors, flashing suddenly, Fell radiant from sky to sea, While sadly as some heart bereaven Throb'd the great luminous Heart of Heaven! Almighty God, who out of clay Fashioned us creatures of a day, Who gave us vision to perceive, And souls to wonder and believe, How calmly, coldly, we behold Thy daily marvels manifold! Thy raiment-hem of glory sweeps Across the darkness of the Deeps, And quickens light and life, O God, In all it touches, stone or clod— And we . . . things of a day, an hour, Accept the wonder as our dower, And wearying of the splendour, lust For darkening pleasures of the dust. Tho' Thou hast girdled us around With ecstasies of sight and sound, Tho' all without us and within Thy Thought takes form and adumbration, Dark is the answer it doth win From us, the waifs of Thy creation! We cry for Miracles, and lo! All Nature is illumed for us! The sun, the stars, the flowers, the snow, Change at Thy touch miraculous— In vain, in vain, the Mystery, We understand not, tho' we see, And like sick children, turning thence, Fret out our little sum of sense! Yet sometimes to Thy touch we quicken A moment, like that Man and Maiden,— And while Thy wonders round us thicken We pause and marvel, passion-laden,— Then lifted in some air divine High o'er this world to yonder Sky, See, where Thy constellations shine, The Darkness of Thy Face go by! An instant only!—could the wonder Last but another, then indeed Our bonds of flesh were torn asunder, And we were purified and freed— But no!—the thrill celestial Ceases and down to Earth we fall, And coldly once again survey Thy miracles of Night and Day! Back to our lovers! Could I tell Of all they felt and dream'd and thought, How Love for ever changed the spell That bound their spirits fever-fraught, How night and day their lives were blent In rapture and abandonment, My song would never end!—the Hours Flew by like maidens crown'd with flowers, Each like the other dancing on, Till many nights and days were gone, How many—who can tell? Not I— For in these passionate relations We count not Time as it goes by, But measure it by palpitations: At last, we waken, and look back Along the pleasant flowery track By which we've journey'd, to discover The flowers are flown, the leaves are dead;— So, at least, was it with our Lover, When his long honeymoon was over And the first bloom of Love had fled. And how it would have ended, whether He would have stealthily departed, Or roughly cut the tender tether That held their sunny lives together, And left the maiden broken-hearted, I know not. Fate, the wild Witch-woman Who thwarts the plans of all things human, Came flying to that Isle so sunny With imps of mischief in her train, And changed Love's waning moon of honey Into a baleful star of pain! VII. Beneath thick boughs of emerald green Turn'd by the sunlight's golden ray To curtains of transparent sheen, They had roam'd, for half a summer's day: Now resting in the dappled shade By silvern fount or bubbling well, Now passing thro' some open glade Where the spent shafts of splendour fell; But ever as they wander'd on The man look'd dark as one who dreams, With inward-looking eyes that shone To restless melancholy gleams; And all her loving arts were vain To stir the shadow of this pain; On passive lips as chill as clay Her kisses fell; her warm hand lay Fluttering in a hand of stone; No look of love, no tender tone, Answer'd the sweetness of her own; Till suddenly the umbrage deep Of those great woodlands still as sleep Parted, and grassy heights were gained Sloping to great crags crimson-stain'd, And 'tween the crags, that heavenward rose Crown'd with one solitary palm, The Ocean!—troublous in repose, Murmurous in folds of summer calm! Then his eye brighten'd, and with fleet Footsteps he hasten'd on until, Where the high cliffs and clouds did meet, The white surge far beneath his feet, He paused, and gladdening drank his fill Of some new rapture. Blithe and bright, To see his gloom had passed away, She join'd him on the lonely height, And, happy as a child at play, Ran gathering ferns and flowers that grew Above the chasm's purple blue Between her and the rocky shore;— She scarce could hear so far away The breaking billows' ceaseless roar, But saw the line of snow-white spray Frozen by distance. Then she turn'd, And lo! his face no longer yearn'd Fondly to hers, but eagerly Bent to the far-off shoreless Sea! And ah! the hunger and the thirst Of sleepless wanderers tempest-nurst, The look which wives and mothers fear I' the eyes of those they hold so dear, The rapture which is Love's despair, The unrest of Ocean, all were there, Mirror'd in that bright restless gaze Which swept the wondrous watery ways! She spoke—he smiled!—and she could read In that strange smile the doom of Love! No more her own, in dream or deed, Lifted in some wild air above Her hopes and dreams, he felt again The power, the passion, and the pain Of that Revolt, that mad Surmise, The sleepless Waters symbolise! But then he looked at her and smiled Again,—and now it seemed once more The smile of Love, tho' wan and wild, Not soft and sunny as before; And gazing back thro' tender tears She drank the smile, and softly scan'd Her lover's face, while on her ears Fell words she could not understand. ‘Close to me, close!’ he cried aloud, ‘Would that this hour, my child, we twain Might mingle, drifting like one cloud Over the melancholy Main! Would that the cup thy love hath brought Might quench the thirst of my despair! Would that my spirit fever-fraught Might kneel with thine in peaceful prayer! But no, the golden Dream is done (O God, how sweet! O God, how fair!) Thy life grows here beneath the sun, Mine is among the Storms, out there! God bless thee, child—if God there be, His benediction must be thine— But voices yonder from the Sea, Voices of Souls as lost as mine, Still call aloud that He I name Hath still no power to calm or tame The spirit who denies and spurns The peace for which thy nature yearns. The storm-cloud touches with its shower The flower that blossoms sweet and low— But the cloud blends not with the flower, Nor rests in peace where flowers may grow. My child, my child! Would I had been Pure like thyself and purely true, Sure of my dower of Light serene, Sure of the earth from which I grew— But no! no rest, no joy, contents The outcast Soul, the sleepless Will— And what the cruel Elements Have mixed in wrath, no Love can still!’ Even as a child who tries to guess The words she little understands, But kindles into happiness Thro' smile of eyes and clasp of hands, She listened! then her lips to his Were sealèd in a heavenly kiss, And running from his side again She gathered flowers and brought them to him, And as he took them, piteous pain, Scornful yet wistful, trembled thro' him. As some bright bird of Paradise, Or some fair fawn-like pard, seem'd she, An earthly thing with elfin eyes, Scarce humanised, yet fond and free; And lo, he loved her,—as men love Earth and the flowers that blossom thence, The beasts and birds of wood and grove, All happy things that live and move Like apparitions round the sense; But deep within his troubled breast An alien love, a vague unrest, Stirr'd to a sense of vaster things, Great doubts and dreams, divine desire,— An eagle's thirst to unfold its wings, Upward to fly in circling rings, And front the blinding solar fire! High o'er the utmost crag there grew The palm-tree, rooted in the rock, Bent by each ocean-blast that blew, But firm amidst the tempest's shock. And round its roots, beneath its shade, Flowers like our wind-flower clustering crept,— Thither, swift-footed, unafraid, Laughing, the little Maiden leapt; Till down beneath her fairy feet She saw the distant surges beat,— Great birds that look'd like butterflies Hovering white o'er ridgèd waves, While trumpet-calls and thunder-cries Rose from the distant chasms and caves;— Then as she gained the lonely tree, And stooped among the flowers, the sound Of air and water suddenly Thunder'd like earthquake all around! Fearless and happy, white and fair, She paused in pretty wonder there, Then looking back beheld her lover Beckoning with face as pale as death. ‘Come back, come back!’ he cried, while over The gulf she hung with bated breath— Then smiling back to him who yearn'd Beyond her, merrily she turn'd, And kneeling o'er the chasm hung To pluck one fair white flower that clung Beneath her o'er the chasm's gloom, With light quick finger touch'd the bloom, And then . . . Great God, who gav'st us sight, Yet see'st us grope with close-shut eyes, Blind to the blessings of the Light, Dead to the Love that deifies! Unto how many men each hour Frail little fingers seek to bring Some gentle gift of love, some flower That is the Soul's best offering? Some happiness which we despise, Some boon we toss aside for ever,— And only that our selfish eyes May smile one moment on the giver! How many of us count or treasure The little lives that perish thus, To garner us a moment's pleasure, A moment's space to comfort us? Blind, ever blind, we front the sun And cannot see the angels near us, Forget the tender duties done By willing slaves, to help and cheer us! Earth and its fulness, all the fair Creations of this heaven and air, All lives which die that we may live, All gifts of service, we pass by, All blessings Love hath power to give We scorn, O God, or we deny! Is there a man beneath the sun, Tho' poor and basest of the base, For whom such duty is not done To pleasure him a little space? A singing bird, a faithful hound, A loving woman, or a child, Contented with our voice's sound, Patient in death if we have smiled, These, these, O God, are daily sent To give thine outcasts sacrament, And in so giving themselves attain Thy sacred privilege of pain! Yet still our eyes turn sunward blindly, And blindly still our souls contemn The loving hands that touch us kindly, The lips that kiss our raiment's hem; And we forget or turn away From flowers that blossom on our way: Blind to the gentle ministration Of tutelary angels near, We find too late that our salvation Lies near, not far;—not there, but here!. . . Even then, as with her little hand She grasped the flower and sought to rise, The crag's edge crumbled into sand, And fluttering from her lover's eyes She vanished!—With a shriek of dread He gained the crag, and pausing there, The great rocks trembling 'neath his tread, Gazed down—and down—thro' voids of air, And saw beneath him, thro' the snow Of flying foam that rose below, A still white form stretch'd silently On those cold rocks that fringed the Sea! What next did pass, he knew not. When His blinded soul grew clear again, He stood beneath the craggy height Close to the surges flashing white, And, dazzled by the foam and spray, Bent o'er that bruised and bleeding Form;— Crush'd on the cruel shore it lay, Silent and still, yet soft and warm; And as he knelt with tender cries Lifting her gently to his breast, She stir'd and moan'd,—then, opening eyes, With one last smile serene and blest, Brighten'd to see her Master bow Above her, gladly drank his breath, With fluttering fingers smooth'd his brow, Kiss'd him, and closed her eyes in death! How still it was! the clouds above Paused quietly and did not move— The waves lay down like lambs—the sound Of crags and waves was hushed all round. ‘O God, my God!’ the Outcast said, Kissing the lips still warm and red, While the frail form hung lax and dead. And lo! there stole upon his ear, Low as his own heart's beat, yet clear, A murmur faint as Sabbath bells Heard far away 'mid forest dells Buried in leaves and haze, so still And soft it only seems the thrill Of silence thro' the summer air— A sigh of rapture and of prayer! And lo! his dark face seaward turn'd, As in a vision he discerned, Thro' thickly flowing tears, a Form In saffron robes and golden hair, Walking with rosy feet all bare The Waters slumbering after storm! A Maiden Shape, her sad blue eyes Soft with the peace of Paradise, She walked the waves; in her white hand Pure lilies of the Heavenly Land Hung alabaster white, and all The billows 'neath her light footfall Heaved glassy still, and round her head An aureole burnt of golden flame, As nearer yet, with radiant tread, Fixing her eyes on his, she came. Then as she paused upon the Sea Gazing upon him silently With looks insufferably bright And gentle brows beatified, He knew our Lady of the Light, Mary Madonna, heavenly-eyed! He look'd—he listen'd. ‘Speak!’ she said, ‘By Him who judgeth quick and dead, Art thou content for evermore Here on the lotus leaf to rest? Speak! and thy wanderings are o'er, And sleep is thine—if sleep be best! Speak!—and this fluttering flower of flesh Shall lift its head and bloom afresh, Guide and companion unto thee Thro' Eden for Eternity;— She loves thee, as the birds and flowers Love, and all things of sun and shore. Speak!—and the sunshine and the showers Shall lap thee deep in these bright bowers For ever and for evermore.’ He answer'd, heavy-eyed and pale, ‘Madonna! let me journey on! Better the surges and the gale, Better to sail and sail and sail Before thy wind, Euroclydon. Here have I found delight and joy, Here hath my spirit been renew'd, Yea, with the mad thirst of a boy, All Adam burning in my blood, I have drunken of the brimming cup Nature for ever holdeth up. Nay more, the primal sympathy, The first sweet force which stirs thro' all, Hath quicken'd gentler thoughts in me Than yonder where the Tempests call— Deep pity kindles in my heart For all glad things beneath the Blue, For her, the brightest and the best, This life of sunlight and of dew; And yet . . . and yet . . . tho' I can weep Above her, since she loved me so, I would not wake her from her sleep To share my happiness or woe! Poor child, she knew no thought of pain! A blossom, born to bloom and kiss, She open'd, then stole back again To Nature's elemental bliss! Here let her dwell, till Time is done, With all such creatures of the sun— Here let her still remain, a part Of Nature's warmly beating heart;— Here, blest and blessing, wrapt up warm In kindling dust, her place shall be, While I return to face the storm Out yonder on the sunless Sea!’ Ev'n as he spake, the air grew dark, Some veil of awe shut out the day, And voices from the Phantom Barque Cried, ‘Hillo! hillo! come away!’ Then, while Our Lady's form grew dim And vanish'd, with sad eyes on him, He saw beyond the line of surge Breaking upon the lonely strand, The shadow of the Ship emerge And hover darkly close to land. And woeful voices of the Sea Call'd to his sould tumultuously, As kneeling by the Maiden's form He kissed the lips that yet were warm, And in the cold still ear that lay Frail as a little ocean-shell, Once warm with life, then wash'd away, Whisper'd his passionate ‘farewell!’ Then, moaning like a death-struck bird, Sprang to his feet, and while he heard The flapping sail, the whistling shroud, The murmuring voices, fill the gloom, ‘I come! I come!’ he cried aloud, And totter'd to the Ship of Doom. INTERLUDE. So endeth Song the First! Long years Ere you and I, my love, were born, The Outcast sail'd away, his ears Full of mad music of the Morn. Once more upon the lonely Main He dree'd his weird of bitter pain, Haunted' by dreams where'er he flew Of that sweet Child of sun and dew. But ten years later, and every ten At intervals 'twixt now and then, He landed wearily again And sought—what still he seeks in vain! The record tells us of his quest From north to south, from east to west,— Affairs with most delightful ladies Of every clime beneath the sun, From far Cathay to sunny Cadiz, From Ispahan to Patagon,— Of all religions and complexions, Of every shape and every fashion; He learn'd all phases of affections,— The dark sultana's introspections, The Persian concubine's soft passion! Thus lightly roaming here and there, Seeking his fate from zone to zone, Betimes he came to Weimar, where Jupiter-Goethe had his throne: This stately Eros in court-breeches Deign'd with our Pilgrim to converse, But bored him hugely with set speeches And pyramids of easy verse,— Of which some solid blocks still stand Amid Saharas of mere sand. In Germany he spent a year Of wondrous love and strange probation— What of that land of bores and beer He thought, you in good time shall hear, If I survive for the narration. Soon afterwards I find that he Roam'd southward, into Italy, And standing near St. Peter's dome, Was present at the sack of Rome. Thence in due time he wander'd right on To Paris, where, some years ago, He saw the garish lamps flash bright on The Second Empire's feverish Show— A Fair by gaslight—booths resplendent, Bright-tinsel'd players promenading, Street lamps with handsome corpses pendent, Couples beneath them gallopading, Soldiers and journalists saluting, Poets and naked harlots dancing, Drums beating, panpipes tootletooting, State wizards gravely necromancing; And in the midst, the lewd and yellow God to whom wooden Joss was fellow,— Enwrapt in purple, painted piebald, Cigar in mouth, lacklustre-eyeball'd, Imperial Cæsar Punchinello! But now, alas! I hesitate Before I venture forward, dreading My Hero's own unhappy fate,— The people's scorn, the critics' hate, For dark's the path my Muse is treading! And this strange poem is compounded Of mixtures new to modern taste, And Mr. Stead may be astounded And think my gentle Muse unchaste. Until we reach the journey's end, (Finis coronat opus!) many May dream I purpose to offend With merest horseplay, like a zany! Mine is a serious song, however, As you shall see in God's good time, If life should crown my long endeavour, And grant me courage to persèver Thro' this mad maze of rakish rhyme. I who now sing have been for long The Ishmaël of modern song,— Wild, tatter'd, outcast, dusty, weary, Hated by Jacob and his kin, Driv'n to the desert dark and dreary, A rebel and a Jacobin; Treated with scorn and much impatience By gentlemanly reputations, And by the critics sober-witted Disliked and boycotted, or pitied. I asked for bread, and got instead of The crust I sought, a curse or stone,— And so, like greater bards you've read of, I've roamed the wilderness alone. But that's all o'er, since I abandon The ground free Mountain Poets stand on, And kneel to say my catechism Before the arch-priests of Nepotism. Henceforth I shall no more resemble Poor Gulliver when caught in slumber, Swarm'd over, prick'd, put all a-tremble, By Liliputians without number. The Saturday Review in pride Will throne me by great Henley's side, The Daily News sound my Te Deum Despite the Devil and A thenœum; Tho' Watts may triple his innuendoes, And Swinburne shriek in sharp crescendoes, The merry Critics all will pat me, The merry Bards bob smiling at me, All Cockneydom with crowns of roses Salute my last apotheosis! For (let me whisper in your ear!) Of Criticism I've now no fear, Since, knowing that the press might cavil, I've joined the Critics' Club—the Savile! And standing pledged to say things pleasant Of all my friends, from Lang to Besant, With many others, not forgetting Our school-room classic, Stevenson, I look for puffs, and praise, and petting, From my new brethren, every one. A Muse with half an eye and knock-knees Would thrive, thus countenanced by Cockneys; And mine, tho' tall, and straight, and strong, Blest with a Highland constitution, Has led a hunted life for long Thro' Cockney hate and persecution. And yet—a terror trembles through me, They may blackball, and so undo, me! In that case I must still continue A Bard that fights for his own hand: Bold Muse, then, strengthen soul and sinew To brave the Liliputian band! I smile, you see, and crack my jest, Altho' my fate has not been funny! Storm-tost, and weary, and opprest, The busy Bee has done his best, But gather'd very little honey! My life has ever been among The drones, in deucèd rainy weather, I've hum'd to keep my heart up, sung A song or two of the sweet heather, Nay, I've been merry too, and tried, As now, to put my gloom aside; But ah! be sure the mirth I wear Is but a mask to hide my care, Since on my soul and on my page Fall shadows of a sunless age, And sadly, faintly, I prolong A broken life with broken song. As Rome was once, when faith was dead, And all the gentle gods were fled, As Rome was, ere on Death's black tree Bloom'd the Blood-rose of Calvary, As Rome was, wrapt in cruel strife By black eclipse of faith and life, So is our world to-day!—and lo! A cloud of weariness and woe, Dark presage of the Tempest near, Fills the sad universe with fear, And in this darkness of eclipse, When Faith is dumb upon the lips, Hope dead within the heart, I share The Time's black birthright of despair; Hear the shrill voice that cries aloud: ‘The gods are fallen and still must fall! King of the sepulchre and shroud, Death keeps his Witches' Festival!’ Hark! on the darkness rings again, Poor human Nature's shriek of pain, Answer'd by cruel sounds that prove The Life of Hate, the Death of Love. Now, since all tender awe hath fled, Not only for the gods o'erhead, But for the tutelary, tiny, Gods that our daily path surround, The kindly, innocent, sunshiny Spirits that mask as ape and hound,— Since neither under nor above him Man reverences the powers that love him, What wonder if, instead of these Who brought him gifts of joy for token, Man looking upward only sees A hideous Spectre of the Brocken, And 'mid his hush of horror, hears The torrent-sound of human tears? The butcher'd woman's dying shriek, The ribald's laugh, the ruffian's yell, While strong men trample on the weak, Proclaim the reign of Hate and Hell. And in the lazar-halls of Art, And in the shrines of Science, priests Of the new Nescience brood apart, Crying, ‘Man's life is as the Beast's!’ There is no goodness 'neath the sun— The days of God and gods are done, And o'er the godless Universe Falls the last pessimistic curse! Old friends, with whom in days less dark I roam'd thro' green Bohemia's glades, While ‘tirra lirra’ sang the lark And lovers listen'd in the shades, When Life was young and Song was merry, And Morals free, and Manners bold, When poets whistled ‘Hey down derry,’ And toil'd for love in lieu of gold, When on the road we trode together Old honest hostels offered cheer, And halting in the sunny weather We gladden'd over pipes and beer, Where are you hiding now? and where Is the Bohemia of our playtime? Where are the heavens that once were fair, And where the blossoms of the May-time? The trees are lopt by social sawyers, The grass is gone, the ways asphalted, Stone walls set up by ethic lawyers Replace the Stiles o'er which we vaulted! See! with rapidity surprising, Thro' jerry-building ministrations, Neat Literary Villas rising To shelter timid reputations; Each with its garden and its gravel, Its little lawn right trimly shaven, Its owner's name, quite clean, past cavil, Upon a brass plate neatly graven! And lo! that all mankind may know it, We are respectable or nothing, The Seer, the Painter, and the Poet Must go in fashionable clothing— High jinks, all tumbling in the hay, All thoughts of pipes and beer, are chidden, The girls who were so glad and gay Must be content in hodden-gray, Nay, merry books must be forbidden. And—ecce signum!—primly drest Here come the Vigilance Committee, Condemning Murger and the rest Because they may corrupt the City! Vie de Bohème!—Life yearned for yet, En pantalon, en chemisette— Life free as sunshine and fresh air, Now gets no hearing anywhere, And o'er a world of knaves and fools The Moral Jerry-builder rules. Moral? By Heaven, I see beneath That saintly mask, the eyes of Death, The wrinkled cheek, the serpent's skin, The sly Mephistophelian grin! And where he wanders thro' the land The green grass withers 'neath his tread, While those trim villas built on sand Crumble around the living-dead. Under the region he controls Sound of a sleeping Earthquake rolls, And at the murmur of his voice The Seven Deadly Sins rejoice! Meantime, the Jerry Legislator, Throttling all natures broad and breezy, Flaunts in the face of the Creator, The good old-fashioned Heavenly Pater, This gospel—‘Providence Made Easy!’ Proving all gods but myths and fiction, He treats man's feeble constitution With moral drugs and civic friction, To force the work of Evolution; Shows ‘Rights’ are merely superstition, And Freedom simply Laisser faire, And puts a ban and prohibition On Life that once was free as air. Behold the scientific dullard, Cocksure of healing Nature's plight, Turning Thought's prism many-colour'd Into one common black and white, Measures our stature, rules our reading, Tells us that he is God's successor, And vows no man of decent breeding Would seek a wiser Intercessor. For ‘Rights,’ read ‘Mights,’ aloud cries he, For ‘Thought,’ ‘Paternal Legislation,’ And substitutes for Liberty The pompous Beadles of the Nation. Aye me, when half Man's race is run, The screech-owl Science, which began By flapping blindly in the sun, Huskily croaking, ‘Night is done! Hark to the Chanticleer of Man!’ Now goose-like hops along the street Behind the Priests and Ruling Classes, And fills the air where birds sang sweet With vestry cackle, as it passes! Ah, for the days when I was young, When men were free and songs were sung In old Bohemia's sylvan tongue! Ah, for Bohemia long since fled,— The blue sky shining overhead, Men comrades all, all women fair, And Freedom radiant everywhere! Ah, then the Poet knew indeed A tenderer soul, a softer creed, And saw in every fair one's eyes The light of opening Paradise; Then, as to lovely forms of fable Old poets yielded genuflection, He knelt to Woman, all unable To throw her corpse upon a table For calm æsthetical dissection! Zola, de Goncourt, and the rest, Had not yet woven their witch's spell, Not yet had Art become a pest To poison Love's pellucid well! We deem'd our mistresses divine, We pledged them deep in Shakespeare's wine, And in the poorest robes could find A Juliet or a Rosalind! And when at night beneath the gas We saw our painted sisters pass, We hush'd our hearts like Christian men Remembering the Magdalen! Well, now that youth no more is mine, I worship still the Shape Divine, And to the outcast I am ready To lift my hat, as to a lady; But when I hear the modern cry, Mocking the human form and face, And watch the cynic's sensual eye, Blind as his little soul is base, And see the foul miasma creep Destroying all things sweet and fair, What wonder if I sometimes weep And feel the canker of despair? That mood, thank God, is evanescent, For I'm an optimist at heart, And 'spite the dark and troubled Present See lights that stir the clouds apart! Rare as the dodo, that strange fowl (Now quite extinct thro' persecution), Despite the hooting of the owl I still preserve my youth's illusion, Believe in God and Heaven and Love, And turning from Life's sorry sight, Watch starry lattices above Opening upon the waves of Night,— Find shapes divine and ever fair Thronging with radiant faces there, While hands of benediction wave O'er these wild waters of the grave. Et ego in Bohemiâ fui! Have known its fountains deep and dewy, Have wander'd where the sun shone mellow On many an honest ragged fellow, And for Bohemia's sake since then Have loved poor brothers of the pen. I've popt at vultures circling skyward, I've made the carrion-hawks a by-word, But never caused a sigh or sob in The heart of mavis or cock-robin, Nay, many such (let Time attest me!) Have fed out of my hand, and blest me! So when my wayward life is ended, With all my sins that can't be mended, And in my singing rags I lie Face upward to the cruel sky, The small birds, fluttering about me, While birds of prey and ravens flout me, May strew a few loose leaves above The Outcast whom so few could love,— And on my grave in flower-wrought words The Inscription set, that men may view it,— ‘He bless'd the nameless singing birds, Loved the Good Shepherd's flocks and herds, Et ille in Bohemiâ fuit!’ FIDES AMANTIS. Dearest and Best! Light of my way! Soul of my Soul, whom God hath sent To be my guardian night and day, To make me humbly kneel and pray, When proudest and most turbulent! Calm of my Life! dear Angel mine! Come to me, now I faint and fail, And guide me softly to the Shrine, Where thro' the deep'ning gloom doth shine Life's bleeding Heart, Love's Holy Grail, Where Soul feels Soul, and Instinct, stirred To Insight, looks Creation thro', And hear me murmur, word by word, The Creed I owe to Heaven and you! ‘I do believe in God; that He Made Heaven and Earth, and you and me! Nay, I believe in all the host Of Gods, from Jesus down to Joss, But honour best and reverence most That guileless God who bore the Cross. I do believe that this dark scheme, This riddle of our life below, Is solved by Insight and by Dream, And not by aught mere Sense can know; That the one sacrifice whereby We attest a faith which cannot die, Is the burnt offering we place On Truth's pure Altar day by day, Whereby the sensual and the base Within us is consumed away; That just as far as we forego Our selfish claim to stand alone, Proving our gladness or our woe Is Humankind's and not our own, So far as for another's sake Our cup of sorrow we accept, And crave, although our hearts should break, The pain supreme of God's Adept, So far shall we attain the height Of Freedom, in the Master's sight. I do believe that our salvation Lies in the little things of life, Not in the pomp and acclamation Of triumph, or in battle-strife, Not on the thrones where men are crown'd, Not in the race where chariots roll, But in the arms that clasp us round And hold us backward from the goal! In Love, not Pride; in stooping low, Not soaring blindly at the sun; In power to feel, not zeal to know; Not in rewards, but duties done. ‘Corollary: all gain is base, The Victor's wreath, the Poet's crown, If conquest in the giddy race Means one poor struggler trampled down, If he who gains the sunless throne Of Fame, sits silent and alone, Without Humanity to share His happiness, or his despair! ‘This Gospel I uphold, the one The latter Adam comes to prove: To every Soul beneath the sun Wide open lies a Heaven of Love; But none, however free from sin, However cloth'd in pomp and pride, However fair, may enter in, Without some Witness at his side, To attest before the Judge and King Vicarious love and suffering. Who stands alone, shall surely fall! Who folds the falling to his breast Stands sure and firm in spite of all, While angel-choirs proclaim him blest.’ Dearest and Best! Soul of my Soul! Life of my Life, kneel here with me! Pray while the Storms around us roll, That God may keep us frail, yet free! Be Love our strength! be God our goal! Amen, et Benedicite! The Wandering Jew. (1893.) TO MY DEAR FATHER ROBERT BUCHANAN POET AND SOCIAL MISSIONARY THIS CHRISTMAS GIFT. Father on Earth, for whom I wept bereaven, Father more dear than any Father in Heaven, Flesh of my flesh, heart of this heart of mine, Still quick, though dead, in me, true son of thine, I draw the gravecloth from thy dear dead face, I kiss thee gently sleeping, while I place This wreath of Song upon thy holy head. For since I live, I know thou art quick not dead, And since thou art quick, yet drawest no living breath, I know, dear Father, that there is Life in Death. This, too, my Soul hath found—that if there were No hope in Heaven, the world might well despair, That thro' the mystery of my hope and love I reach the Mystery that dwells above . . . Father on Earth, still lying calm and blest After long years of trouble and sad unrest, Sleep,—while the Christ I paint for men to see Seeketh the Fatherhood I found in thee! Come, Faith, with eyes of patient heavenward gaze! Come, Hope, with feet that bleed from thorny ways! With hand for each, leading those twain to me, Come with thy gifts of grace, fair Charity! Bring Music too, whose voices trouble so Our very footfalls as we graveward go, Whose bright eyes, as she sings to Humankind, Shine with the glory of God which keeps them blind! Not to Parnassus, nor the Fabled Fount, Nor to the folds of that Diviner Mount Whereon our Milton kneeling prayed so deep,— But hither, to this City stretched asleep In silence, to this City of souls bereaven, I call you, gracious hierophants of Heaven! Come, Muses of the bleeding heart of Man, Fairer than all the Nine Parnassian, Fairer and clad in grace more heavenly Than those sweet visions of Man's infancy, Come from your lonely heights with song and prayer To inspire an epos of the World's despair! For lo, to that White Light which floweth from Him Before whose gaze all sense and sight grow dim, Holpen by you, His Angels pure and strong, With tears I raise this tremulous Prism of Song! O shine thereon, White Light, and melted be Into the hues that lose themselves in Thee, And tho' they are broken and but faintly show Hints of the ray no sight may see or know, On the poor Song let some dim gleam remain To prove that Light Divine is never sought in vain! I. As in the City's streets I wander'd late, Bitter with God because my wrongs seem'd great, Chiller at heart than the bleak winds that flew Under the star-strewn voids of steel-bright blue, Sick at the silence of the Snow, and dead To the white Earth beneath and Heaven o'erhead, I heard a voice sound feebly at my side In hollow human accents, and it cried ‘For God's sake, mortal, let me lean on thee!’ And as I turn'd in mute amaze to see Who spake, there flew a whirlwind overhead In which the lights of Heaven were darkenèd, Shut out from sight or flickering sick and low Like street-lamps when a sudden blast doth blow; But I could hear a rustling robe wind-swept And a faint breathing; then a thin hand crept Into mine own, clammy and cold as clay! 'Twas on that Night which ushereth in Christ's Day. The winds had winnowèd the drifts of cloud, But the white fall had ceased. There, pale and proud, In streets of stone empty of life, while Sleep In silvern mist hung beautiful and deep Over the silent City even as breath, I mused on God and Man, on Life and Death, And mine own woe was as a glass wherein I mirror'd God's injustice and Man's sin. And so, remembering the time, I sneer'd To think the mockery of Christ's birth-tide near'd, And pitying thought of all the blinded herd Who eat the dust and ashes of the Word, Holding for all their light and all their good The woeful Man upon the Cross of wood; And bitterly to mine own heart I said, ‘In vain, in vain, upon that Cross He bled! In vain He swore to vanquish Death, in vain He spake of that glad Realm where He should reign! Lo, all His promise is a foolish thing, Flowers gathered by a child and withering In the moist hand that holdeth them; for lo! Winter hath come, and on His grave the snow Lies mountain-deep; and where He sleeping lies We too shall follow soon and close our eyes Unvex'd by dreams. The golden Dream is o'er, And he whom Death hath conquer'd wakes no more!’ Even then I heard the desolate voice intone, And the thin hand crept trembling in my own, And while my heart shut sharp in sudden dread Against the rushing blood, I murmurèd ‘Who speaks? who speaks?’ Suddenly in the sky The Moon, a luminous white Moth, flew by And from her wings silent and mystical Thick rays of vitreous dust began to fall, Illuming Earth and Heaven; when I was 'ware Of One with reverend silver beard and hair Snow-white and sorrowful, looming suddenly In the new light like to a leafless Tree Hung round with ice and magnified by mist Against a frosty Heaven! But ere I wist Darkness return'd, the splendour died away, And all I felt was that thin hand which lay Fluttering in mine! Then suddenly again I heard the tremulous voice cry out in pain ‘For God's sake, mortal, let me lean on thee!’ And peering thro' the dimness I could see Snows of white hair blowing feebly in the wind; And deeply was I troubled in my mind To see so ancient and so weak a Wight At the cold mercy of the storm that night, And said, while 'neath his wintry load he bent, ‘Lean on me, father!’ adding, as he leant Feebly upon me, wearied out with woe, ‘Whence dost thou come? and whither dost thou go?’ O then, meseem'd, the womb of Heaven afar Quickened to sudden life, and moon and star Flash'd like the opening of a million eyes, Dimming from every labyrinth of the skies Their lustre on that Lonely Man; and he Loom'd like a comer from a far Countrie In ragged antique raiment, and around His waist a rotting rope was loosely bound, And in one feeble hand a lanthorn quaint Hung lax and trembling, and the light was faint Within it unto dying, tho' it threw Upon the snows beneath him light enew To show his feeble feet were bloody and bare! Thereon, with deep-drawn breath and dull dumb stare, ‘Far have I travelled and the night is cold,’ He murmur'd, adding feebly, ‘I am old!’ He spake like one whose wits are wandering, And strange his accents were, and seem'd to bring The sense of some strange region far away; And like a cagèd Lion gaunt and grey Who, looking thro' the bars, all woe-begone, Beholdeth not the men he looketh on, But gazeth thro' them on some lonely pool Far in the desert, whither he crept to cool His sunburnt loins and drink when strong and free, Ev'n so with dull dumb stare he gazed thro' me On some far bourne; and tho' his eyes were bright They seem'd to suffer from the piteous light They shed upon me thro' his hoary hair! Then was I seized with wonder unaware To see a man so old and strangely dight Wandering alone beneath the Heavens that night; For round us were the silenced haunts of trade, The public marts and buildings deep in shade, All emptied of their living waters; cold And swift the stars did plunge thro' fold on fold Of vaporous gauze, wind-driven; and the street Was washen everywhere around my feet With smoky silver; and the stillness round Was dreadfuller by memory of the sound Which fill'd the place all day from dawn to dark: And strange it was and pitiful to mark The heavy snow of years upon this Man, His furrow'd cheeks down which the rheumdrops ran, His wintry eyes that saw some summer land Far off and very peaceful, while his hand Dank as the drownèd dead's lay loose in mine. But, my fear lessening, eager to divine What man he was, and thro' what cruel fate He wander'd homeless and disconsolate, Scourged by the pitiless God who hateth men, A victim, the more piteous in his pain Because that God had given him length of days, I cried, ‘Who art thou? From what weary ways Comest thou, father? Thou art frail and old! Sad is thy lot upon a night so cold To wander barefoot in a world of snow! Speak to me, father! for I fain would know What cruel Hand is on thee out of Heaven, That by the wintry tempests thou art driven Hither and thither? Speak thy grief out strong, For God, I know, is hard, and I, too, have my wrong.’ Then as I looked full eagerly on him, And my limbs trembled and mine eyes grew dim, With dull still gaze he starèd on thro' me At that far bourne of rest his Soul could see, And shiver'd as the frost took blood and bone, And even as a feeble child might moan He murmured, ‘I am hungry and athirst!’ O then my soul was sicken'd, and I curst The winds and snows that smote this Man so old, And drave him outcast thro' the wintry wold, And made the belly of him tight with pain For lack of food, and only with the rain Moisten'd his toothless gums! and 'neath my breath I curst the pitiless Lord of Life and Death, And ‘All the hate I bear for Him who wrought This crumbling prison-house of flesh' (me-thought) ‘Is vindicated by this Wight who bears The rueful justification of grey hairs!’ And as I held his clay-cold hand, nor spake, For I was hoarse with sorrow for his sake, He cried in a strange, witless, wandering way, Not loud, but as a burthen children say When they have known it long by heart, ‘Aye me! The blessèd Night is dark on land and sea, On tired eyes the dusts of Sleep are shed, And yet I have no place to rest my head!’ Ev'n as he spake there flash'd across my sight A glamour of the Sleepers of the Night: The hushèd rooms where dainty ladies dream, And shaded night-lamps shed a slumberous gleam Across the silken sheets and broider'd couch; The beggarman, a groat within his pouch, Pillow'd on filthy rags and chuckling deep Because his dreams are golden; the sweet sleep Of little children holding in pink palm The fancied toy, and smiling; slumbers calm Of delicate-limb'd vestals, slumbers wild Of puerperal women and of nymphs defiled Wasting like rotten fruit;—as scenes we see By lightning flashes, changing momently, These visions came and went, each gleaming clear Yet spectral, in the act to disappear; I marked the long streets empty to the sky, And every dim square window was an eye That gazing dimly inward saw within Some hidden mystery of shame or sin,— Lovebed and deathbed, raggedness and wealth, Pale Murder, tiptoe, creeping on in stealth With sharp uplifted knife, or haggard Lust Mouthing his stolen fruit of tasteless dust; And then I saw strange huddled shapes that lay In blankets under palm trees, while the day Drew far across the sands its blood-red line; The sailor drearily dozing, while the brine Flash'd eyes of foam around him; glimpses then Of purple royal chambers, where pale men Lay naked of their glory; and of the warm Bonfires on mountain sides, where many a form Lay prone but gript the sword; of halls of stone Lofty and cold, where wounded men made moan, And the calm nurse stole softly down the row Of narrow sickbeds, like a ghost; and lo! These pictures swiftly came and vanishèd Like northern meteors, leaving as they fled A trouble like the wash of leaden seas. Then, while the glamour of such images Weighed on my Soul, I said, ‘Hard by I dwell,— Poor is the place, yet thou mayst find it well After thy travail. Thither let us go!’ And by my side he falter'd feeble and slow, Breathing the frosty air with pain, and soon We reached a lonely Bridge o'er which the Moon Hung phosphorescent, blinding with its wings The lamps that flicker'd there like elfin things; But near us, on the water's brim, engloom'd In its own night, a mighty Abbey loom'd, Clothen with rayless snow as with a shroud; And suddenly that old Man cried aloud, Lifting his weary face and woe-begone Up to the painted window-panes that shone With frosty glimmers, ‘Open, O thou Priest Who waitest in the Temple!’ As he ceased, The fretted arches echoed to the cry And with a shriek the wintry wind went by And died in silence. For a moment's space He stood and listened with upturnèd face, Then moan'd and faltered on in dumb despair, Until we stood upon the Bridge, and there The vitreous light was luminously drawn, Making the lamps burn dim, as in a ghostly dawn. II. Vaster and mightier a thousandfold Than Babylon or Nineveh of old, Shrouded in snow the silent City slept; And through its heart the great black River crept Snakewise, with sullen coils that as they wound Flash'd scales of filmy silver; all around The ominous buildings huddled from the light With cold grey roofs and gables tipt with white, And lines of lamps made a pale aqueous glow With streaks of crimson in the pools below Between the clustering masts. 'Twas still, like Death! Still as a snow-clad grave! No stir! No breath! A mist of silence o'er the City asleep, A frozen smoke of incense that did creep From Life's deserted Altar. And on high Clouds white as wool that melted o'er the sky Before the winnowing beams. In Heaven's Serene No sound! no stir! but all the still stars, green With their exceeding lustre, shedding light From verge to verge of the great dome of Night, And scattering hoarfrost thro' the lustrous space Between their spheres and the dark dwelling place Of mortals blind to sight and dead to sound. So lay the silent City glory-crowned, All the rich blood of human life that flows Thro' its dark veins hushèd in deep repose, The pulses of its heart scarce felt to beat, Calm as a corpse, the snow its winding sheet, The sky its pall; and o'er its slumbers fell The white Moon's luminous and hypnotic spell, As when some bright Magician's hands are prest With magic gloves upon a Monster's breast, So that the heart just flutters, and the eyes Shut drowsily!—But it dream'd beneath the skies God knows what dreams! What dreams of Heavens unknown, Where sits the Lord of Life on His white Throne, While angel-wings flash thick as fowl that flee Round islands Hebridean, when the Sea Burns to a molten sapphire of dead calm! Upon my fever'd eyes fell soft as balm The ablution of the Midnight, as once more I led that old Man weary and footsore, Guiding his steps, while ever and anon He paused in pain; and thro' the light that shone O'er the still Bridge we falter'd, with no sound. Then, as he paused for breath, and gazed around, Again I questioned gently whence he came, His place of birth, his kindred, and his name, And whisper'd softly, ‘I can surely see Thou art a comer from a far Countrie, And thou art very old!’—‘So old! so old!’ He answered, shivering in the moonlight cold; Then raised his head, upgazing thro' the Night, And threw his arms up quick, and rose his height, Crying, ‘For ever at the door of Death Faintly I knock, and when it openeth Would fain creep in, but ever a Hand snow-cold Thrusteth me back into the open wold, And ever a voice intones early and late “Until thy work is done, remain and wait!” And century after century I have trod The infinitely weary glooms of God, And lo! the Winter of mine age is here!’ Even as he spake, in a low voice yet clear, Clinging upon me, with his hungry eyes Cast upward at the cold and pitiless skies, His white hair blent with snows around him blown, And his feet naked on the Bridge of stone, Methought I knew that Wanderer whom God's curse Scourgeth for ever thro' the Universe Because he mocked with words of blasphemy God's Martyr on the path to Calvary, Yea, did deny Him on His day of Death! Wherefore, with shuddering sense and bated breath I gazed upon him. Shivering he stood there, The consecration of a vast despair Cast round him like a raiment; and ere I knew I moaned aloud, ‘Thou art that Wandering Jew Whose name all men and women know too well!’ Strangely on me his eyes of sorrow fell, And bending low, as doth a wind-blown tree, In a low voice he answer'd: ‘I am He!’ III. O night of wonder! O enchanted Night! Full of strange whisperings and wondrous light, How shall I, singing, summon up again Thine hours of awe and deep miraculous pain? For as I stood upon those streets of stone I seem'd to hear the wailing winds intone ‘Ahasuerus!’—while with lips apart, His thin hand prest upon his fluttering heart, His face like marble lit by lightning's glare, His frail feet bleeding, and his bosom bare, List'ning he stood! From the blue Void o'erhead Starlight and moonlight round his shape were shed, And the chill air was troubled all around With piteous wails and echoes of such sound As fills the great sad Sea on nights of Yule, When all the cisterns of the heavens are full And one great hush precedes the coming Storm. And like a snow-wrapt statue seem'd the form I looked on, and of more than mortal height! Wintry his robe, his hair and beard snow-white Frozen like icicles, his face all dim, And in the sunken, sunless eyes of him Silent despair, as of a lifeless stone! And then meseem'd that in some frozen zone, Where never flower doth blossom or grass is green, Chill'd to the heart by cruel winds and keen Shiv'ring I stood, and the thick choking breath Of Frost was round me, terrible as Death, And he I look'd on was a figure wan Hewn out of snow in likeness of a Man; And all the silent City in a trice Was turn'd to domes and towers of rayless ice, As of some spectral City whose pale spires Are lighted dimly with the auroral fires That gleam for ever at the sunless Pole! How long this glamour clung upon my Soul I know not; but at last methought I spake, Like one who, fresh from vision, half awake, Murmurs his thought: ‘Father of men that roam, Outcast from God and exile from thy home (If such there be for any Soul in need), I will not say, God bless thee, since indeed God's blessing is a burthen and a blight; Yet will I bless thee, in that God's despite, Knowing thy sorrow manifold and deep. Aye me, aye me, what may I do but weep, Seeing thy poor grey hair, and frail shape driven Hither and thither by the winds of Heaven, Sharing thy sorrow, hearing thy sad moan That penetrates all hearts but God's alone, Knowing thee mortal, yet predoom'd to fare For ever, with no rest-place anywhere, Although all other mortal things may die! Death is the one good thing beneath the sky; Death is the one sweet thing that men may see; Yet even this God doth deny to thee! Thou canst not die!’ With feeble lips of clay He answered, yet the voice seem'd far away, ‘Yea, Death is best, and yet I cannot die!’ Before my vision, as I heard the cry, There flash'd a glamour of the Dead; and lo! I saw a hooded Phantom come and go Across great solitary plains by night, Red with all nameless horror of the fight, And dead white faces glimmer'd from the sward, And here a helmet gleamed and there a sword, And all was still and dreadful, and the scent Of carnage thickened where the Phantom went. This faded, and methought I stood stone-still In a great Graveyard strewn with moonbeams chill Like bleaching shrouds, and through the grassy glooms Pale crosses glimmer'd and great marble tombs; But as I crost my frozen hands to pray The apparition changed and died away, And I was walking very silently Some oozy bottom of the sunless Sea. And 'midst the sombre foliage I could mark Black skeletons of many a shipwreck'd bark Within whose meshes, washing to and fro, Were skeletons of men as white as snow Picked clean by many a hideous ocean-thing. The waters swung around me as they swing Round drowning men, and with a choking pain I struggled,—and that moment saw again The sleeping City and the cold Moonshine, And in the midst, with his blank eyes on mine, That Man of Mystery who could not die! And lo, his lips were open'd with a cry, And his lean hands were stretchèd up to Heaven. ‘Ah, woe is me,’ he said, ‘to stand bereaven Of that which every man of clay may share! Eternity hath snowed upon my hair, And yet, though feeble and weary, I endure. Still might I fare, if Death at last were sure, If I might see, eternities away, A grave, wide open, where my feet might stay!’ Then in a lower voice more deep with dread, ‘Father which art in Heaven,’ the old Man said, ‘Thou from the holy shelter of whose wing I came, an innocent and shining thing, A lily in my hand and in mine eyes The passion and the peace of Paradise, Thou who didst drop me gently down to rest A little while upon my Mother's breast, Wrapt in the raiment of a mortal birth, How long, how long, across Thy stricken Earth Must I fare onward, deathless? Tell me, when May I too taste the cup Thou givest to men, My brethren and Thy children and the heirs Of all my spirit's sorrows and despairs? My work is o'er—my sin (if sin there be) Is buried with the bones of Calvary; My blessing has been spoken, and my curse Is wingèd vengeance in Thy Universe; My voice hath thrill'd Thy dark Eternity To protestation and to agony, And Man hath listen'd with wild lips apart As to a cry from his own breaking heart! What then remains for me to do, O God, But fold thin hands and bend beneath Thy rod, And ask for respite after labour done?’ In sorrow and in awe he spake, as one Communing with some Shape I could not mark, And all his words seem'd wild, his meaning dark; And as he ceased the Heavens grew dark in woe, And faster, thicker, fell the encircling Snow Wrapping him with its whiteness round and round; But from the Void above no sign, no sound, Came answering his prayer. ‘Father,’ I said, ‘Chill falls the snow upon thy holy head (Yea, holy through much sorrow 'tis to me), And He to whom thou prayest so piteously Hears not, and will not hear, and hath not heard Since first the Spirit of Man drew breath and stirred! Let us seek shelter!’ But I spake in vain— He heard not; but as one that dies in pain Sank feebly on the parapet of stone. Upon his naked breast the Snow was blown Thicker and colder—on his hoary head Heavily like a cruel hand of lead It thickened—so he stood from head to feet Smother'd and wrapt as in a winding sheet, Forlorn and weary, panting, overpowered. Then lo! a miracle!—For a space he cowered As if o'ermastered by the cruel touch, But all at once, as one that suffers much Yet quickeneth into anger suddenly, He said, in a sharp voice of sovereignty, ‘Cease, cease!’ and at the very voice's sound, The white Snow wildly wavering round and round Rose like a curtain, leaving all things bright! Spell-bound and wonder-stricken at the sight, And comprehending not its import yet (For still my Soul with fever and with fret Was laden, and I bore upon my mind The darkness of that doubt that keeps men blind), I cried, ‘See! see! the elemental Snow Obeys thy call, in pity for thy woe— Gentler than He who fashioned men for pain, The white Snow and the wild Wind and the Rain Would bless thee, and there is no cruel beast Which He hath made, the greater or the least, Which would not spare thy life and lick thy hand, Poor outcast comer from a lonely land. Yea, only God is cruel—Only He Whose foot is on the Mountains and the Sea, And on the bruisèd frame and flesh of Man!’ IV. Lo, now the Moonlight lit his features wan With spectral beams, and o'er his hoary hair A halo of brightness fell, and rested there! And while upon his face mine eyes were bent In utterness of woeful wonderment, Into mine ear the strange voice crept once more: ‘Far have I wandered, weary and spiritsore, And lo! wherever I have chanced to be, All things, save men alone, have pitied me!’ Then—then—even as he spake, forlornly crown'd By the cold light that wrapt him round and round, I saw upon his twain hands raised to Heaven Stigmata bloody as of sharp nails driven Thro' the soft palms of mortals crucified! And swiftly glancing downward I descried Stigmata bloody on the naked feet Set feebly on the cold stones of the street!— And moveless in the frosty light he stood, Ev'n as one hanging on the Cross of wood! Then, like a lone man in the north, to whom The auroral lights on the world's edge assume The likeness of his gods, I seem'd to swoon To a sick horror; and the stars and moon Reel'd wildly o'er me, swift as sparks that blow Out of a forge; and the cold stones below Chattered like teeth! For lo, at last I knew The lineaments of that diviner Jew Who like a Phantom passeth everywhere, The World's last hope and bitterest despair, Deathless, yet dead!— Unto my knees I sank, And with an eye glaz'd like the dying's drank The wonder of that Presence! White and tall And awful grew He in the mystical Chill air around Him,—at His mouth a mist Made by His frosty breathing!—Then I kissed His frozen raiment-hem, and murmurèd ‘Adonai! Master! Lord of Quick and Dead!’ 'Twas more than heart could suffer and still beat— So with a hollow moan I fainted at his feet! V. O ye, ye ancient men born yesterday, Some few of whom may in this Yuletide lay Feel echoes of your own hearts, listen on, Till the faint music of the harp is gone And the weak hand drops leaden down the string! For lo, I voice to you a mystic thing Whose darkness is as full of starry gleams As is a tropic twilight; in your dreams This thing shall haunt you and become a sound Of friendship in still places, and around Your lives this thing shall deepen, and impart A music to the trouble of the heart, So that perchance, upon some gracious day, Ye may bethink you of the Song, and pray That God may bless the Singer for your sake! Not unto bliss and peace did I awake From that deep swoon, nor to the garish light Wherein all spiritual things grow slight And vanish—nay;—the midnight and the place Had changèd not, and o'er me still the Face Shone piteously serene; I felt its ray On mine unclosèd eyelids as I lay; Then gazing up, blinking mine eyes for dread Of some new brightness, I discerned instead That Man Forlorn, and as I gazed He smiled Even as a Father looking on a child! Aye me! the sorrow of that smile! 'Twas such As singer ne'er may sing or pencil touch!— But ye who have seen the light that is in snow, The glimmer on the heights where sad and slow Some happy day is dying—ye who have seen Strange dawns and moonlit waters, woodlands green Troubled with their own beauty; think of these, And of all other tender images, Then think of some belovèd face asleep 'Mid the dark pathos of the grave, blend deep Its beauty with all those until ye weep, And ye may partly guess the woe divine Wherewith that face was looking down on mine,— While trembling, wondering like a captive thrown By cruel hands into some cell of stone, Who waiting Death to end his long despair Sees the door open and a friend stand there Bringing new light and life into his prison, I faltered, ‘Lord of Life, hast Thou arisen?’ ‘Arisen! Arisen! Arisen!’ At the word The silent cisterns of the Night were stirred And plash'd with troublous waters, and in the sky The pale stars clung together, while the cry Was wafted on the wind from street to street! Like to a dreaming man whose heart doth beat With thick pulsations while he fights to break The load of terror with a shriek and wake, The sleeping City trembled thro' and thro'! And in its darkness opened to my view As by enchantment, those who slumberèd Rose from their pillows, listening in dread; And out of soot-black windows faces white Gleamed ghost-like, peering forth into the night; And haggard women by the River dark, Crawling to plunge and drown, stood still to heark; And in the silent shrouded Hospitals, Where the dim night-lamp flickering on the walls Made woeful shadows, men who dying lay, Picking the coverlet as they pass'd away And babbling babe-like, raised their heads to hear, While all their darkening sense again grew clear, And moaned ‘Arisen! Arisen!’ In his cell The Murderer, for whom the pitiless bell Would toll at dawn, sat with uplifted hair And broke to piteous impotence of prayer! Then all grew troubled as a rainy Sea, I sank in stupor, struggling to be free Even as a drowning wight; and as the brain Of him who drowneth flasheth with no pain Into a sudden vision of things fled, Faces forgotten, places vanishèd Came, went, and came again, and 'mid it all I knew myself the weary, querulous, small, Weak, wayward Soul, with little hope or will, Crying for ‘God, God, God,’ and thrusting still Cain's offering on His altar. All this pass'd— Then came a longer darkness—and at last I found myself upon my feet once more Tottering and faint and fearful, a dull roar Of blood within mine ears, still crying aloud ‘Arisen! Arisen! Arisen!’ . . . Whereon the cloud Of wonder lifted, and again mine eyes Saw the sad City sleeping 'neath the skies, Silent and flooded with the white Moon's beams As still as any City seen in dreams; And lo! the great Bridge, and the River that ran Blindly beneath it, and that hoary Man Standing thereon with naked piercèd feet Uplooking to the Heavens as if to meet Some vision; and the abysses of the air Had opened, and the Vision was shining there! Far, far away, faint as a filmy could, A Form Divine appeared, her bright head bowed, Her eyes down-looking on a Babe she prest In holy rapture to her gentle breast, And tho' all else was ghost-like, strange and dim, A brightness touched the Babe and cover'd Him,— Such brightness as we feel in summer days When hawthorn blossoms scent the flowery ways And all the happy clay is verdure-clad; And the Babe seem'd as others who make glad The homes of mortals, and the Mother's face Was like a fountain in a sunny place Giving and taking gladness, and her eyes Beheld no other sight in earth or skies Save the blest Babe on whom their light did shine; But he, that little one, that Babe Divine, Gazed down with reaching hands and face aglow Upon the Lonely Man who stood below, And smiled upon Him, radiant as the morn! Whereat the weary Christ raised arms forlorn And answer'd with a thin despairing moan! And at the sound Darkness like dust was blown Over the Heavens, and the sweet Vision fled, And all that wonder of the night was dead! . . . . Yet still I saw Him looming woe-begone Upon the lonely Bridge, and faltering on With feeble feet beneath the falling snow, And in His hand the lamp hung, flickering low As if to die, yet died not. Far away He seemèd now, altho' so near,—a grey Ghost seen in dreams; yet even as dreams appear To one who sleeps more mystically clear Than any vision of the waking sight, He shone upon the sadness of the Night As softly as a star, while all around Loom'd the great City, sleeping with no sound Save its own deep-drawn breath. Yet I could mark The glimmer of eyes that watched Him from the dark Shadows beyond the Bridge, and, where the rays Of the dim moonlight lit the frozen ways, Shapes crouching low or crawling serpentwise Waited to catch the pity of His eyes Or touch His raiment-hem! Then, while I wept For pity of His loneliness, and crept In wonder after Him, with bated breath, Fell a new Darkness deep and dread as Death; And from the Darkness came tumultuously Clangour and roar as of a storm-torn Sea,— And, shrill as shrieks of ocean-birds that fly Over the angry waters, rose the cry Of human voices! Then the four Winds blew Their clarions, while the stormy tumult grew, And all was dimly visible again. VI. Methought I stood upon an open Plain Beyond the City, and before my face Rose, with mad surges thundering at its base, A mountain like Golgotha; and the waves That surgèd round its sunless cliffs and caves Were human—countless swarms of Quick and Dead! Then, while the fire-flaught flickered over-head, I saw the Phantoms of Golgotha throng Around that ancient Man, who trailed along A woeful Cross of Wood; and as He went, His body bruisèd and His raiment rent, His bare feet bleeding and His force outworn, They pricked Him on with spears and laughed in scorn, Shouting, ‘At last Thy Judgment Day hath come!’ And when He faltered breathless, faint, and dumb, And stumbled on His face amid the snows, They dragged Him up and drave Him on with blows To that black Mountain! Then my soul was 'ware Of One who silent sat in Judgment there Shrouded and spectral; lonely as a cloud He loomed above the surging and shrieking crowd. Human he seemed, and yet his eyeballs shone From fleshless sockets of a Skeleton, And from the shroud around him darkly roll'd He pointed with a fleshless hand and cold At those who came, and, in a voice that thrill'd The tumult at his feet till it was still'd, Cried: ‘Back, ye Waters of Humanity! Wait and be silent. Leave this man to me. The centuries of his weary watch have pass'd, And lo! the Judgment Time is ripe at last. Stand up, thou Man whom men would doom to death, And speak thy Name!’ ‘Jesus of Nazareth!’ Answer'd the Man. And as He spake His name, The multitude with thunderous acclaim Shriek'd. But again the solemn voice, which thrill'd The tumult and the wrath till they were still'd, Cried: ‘Peace, ye broken hearts, have patience yet! This man is surely here to pay his debt To Death and Time.’ And to the man he said: ‘Jesus of Nazareth, lift up thy head And hearken! Brought to face Eternity By men, thy brethren, form'd of flesh like thee, Brough there by men to me, the Spirit of Man, To answer for thy deeds since life began, Brought hither to Golgotha, whereupon Thyself wast crucified in days long gone, Thou shalt be judged and hear thy judgment spoken Before the World whose slumbers thou hast broken. Thou saidst, “I have fought with Death and am the stronger! Wake to Eternal Life and sleep no longer!” And men, thy brethren, troubled by thy crying, Have rush'd from Death to seek the Life undying, And men have anguish'd, wearied out with waiting For the great unknown Father of thy creating, And now for vengeance on thy head they gather, Crying, “Death reigns! There is no God— no Father!”’ He ceased, and Jesus spake not, but was mute In woe supreme and pity absolute. Then calmly amid the shadows of the Throne Another awful shrouded Skeleton, Human yet more than human, rose his height, With baleful eyes of wild and wistful light, And said: ‘O Judge, Death reigned since Time began, Sov'ran of Life and Change! and ere this Man Came with his lying dreams to break our rest The reign of Death was beautiful and blest; But now within the flesh of men there grows The poison of a Dream that slays repose, The trouble of a mirage in the air That turneth into terror and despair; So that the Master of the World, ev'n Death, Hated in his own kingdom, travaileth In darkness, creeping haunted and afraid, Like any mortal thing, from shade to shade, From tomb to tomb; and ever where he flies The seed of men shrink with averted eyes, And call with mad yet unavailing woe On this Man and his God to lay Death low. Wherefore the Master of the Quick and Dead Demandeth doom and justice on the head Of him, this Jew, who hath usurp'd the throne The Lord of flesh claims ever for his own. This Jew hath made the Earth that once was glad A lazar-house of woeful men and mad Who can yet will not sleep, and in their strife For barren glory and eternal Life, Have rent each other, murmuring his Name!’ He paused—and from the listening host there came Tumult nor voice—there was no sound, no stir, But all was hushèd as a death-chamber; And while that pallid shrouded Skeleton In a low voice like funeral bells spake on, From heart to heart a nameless horror ran. VII. ‘In the name of all men I arraign this Man, Named Jesus, son of Joseph, and self-styled The Son of God! ‘Born in the East, the child Of Jewish parents, toiling for their bread, He grew to manhood, following, it is said, His father's humble trade of carpentry; But hearing one day close to Galilee, One John, a madman, in the desert crying Baptising all who came and prophesying, This Jesus also long'd to prophesy; And lo! ere very many days went by He left his tools, forsook his native town, And for a season wandered up and down On idle preaching bent. Now, as we know, Madness and Falsehood wedded are, and grow With what they breed; so the Accused ere long, Finding his audience fit, his rivals strong (For prophets in those realms were thick as bees), Began to invent such fables as might please The ears of ignorant wonder-seeking men, And finding 'mong the Jewish race just then The wild old prophecy of a Christ and King, Destined to lead the race, still lingering, He threw the royal raiment ready made On his bare back, and blasphemously played The Christ they craved for!—next, to clinch his claim, And prove his Godhead not an empty name, The Man wrought miracles, calling to his aid Simple devices of the wizard's trade, Healing the sick—nay, even, 'twas avowed, Bidding a dead man quicken in his shroud! Pass over that as idle—turn with me To the completion of his infamy! In time, when he had sown with such false seed Rank madness broadcast like an evil weed, Choking the wholesome fields of industry, And setting all the fiends of folly free, This Jesus, with great numbers following, Rides to Jerusalem like any King, And thronèd on an ass goes thro' the Gate. Arrived within the City, he keeps his state With publicans and harlots, vaunts abroad His proud vocation as the Son of God, And last, presuming on his pride of place, Profanes the Holy Temple of the race. The rest we know—they slew him, as was right, Set him upon a Cross in all men's sight, Then, lastly, buried him. And now 'twas thought The Man had made amends; the ill he wrought Died with him, since his foolish race was run. ‘Not so; the Man's black crime had scarce begun! ‘For on the Sabbath day, as scribes aver, Three Women, watching by his Sepulchre, Beheld the stone roll'd back, and in the gloom Beyond, a cast-off shroud and empty tomb! The Man had risen, and that very day Appeared among the faithful far away, Spake, vanish'd, and was never after seen By those who knew him, loved him, and had been His life-long followers. ‘Now, hear and heed— Had this Man, like the rest of Adam's seed, Rested within his grave, turned back to dust, Accepted dissolution, as were just, Well had it been for him and all man's race! ‘He rose, this Jew—but in what secret place He for a season hid his evil head We know not; followers of his tribe have said He walked with bleeding feet dejectedly The lava shores of Hell (if Hell there be!), Pondering his plan to lead the world astray— But after sundry years had pass'd away Mortals began to see in divers lands A Phantom pale with piercèd feet and hands Who cried, “I am the Christ—believe on me— Or lose your Souls alive eternally!” And of those men a few believed, and cried “Lo! Christ is God, and God we crucified! But He shall come to judge the Quick and Dead!” ‘Now, mark the issue. Where this rumour spread, All other gentle gods that gladden'd Man Faded and fled away: the priests of Pan, That singing by Arcadian rivers rear'd Their flowery altars, wept and disappeared; And men forgot the fields and the sweet light, Joy, and all wonders of the day and night, All splendours of the sense, all happy things, Art, and the happy Muses' ministerings, Forgot that radiant house of flesh divine Wherein each Soul is shut as in a shrine, Because this Phantom, like a shape in sleep, Showing hisred wounds, murmur'd, “Pray! and weep!” And when fair Earth, mother of things of clay, The gladsome Mother, now grown gaunt and grey, Cried to her children, “Children, stay with me! I made you happy, innocent, and free! Although this Man, my latest born, your brother, Casts dust in the living eyes of me, his mother, Follow him not, forsake me not, but stay!” They too, because he beckon'd, turned away, Or cursing her who bare them, they too shed Dust in her eyes, dishonour on her head. ‘First, in her name, the Mother of all our race, Whom this unfilial hand smote in the face, Whom he defamed and shamed with cheats and lies, And taught a thousand children to despise, I demand justice on her Son, this Jew!— ‘Pass on. The rumour of his godhead grew; Yea, men were conscious of a Presence sad, Crownèd with thorns, in ragged raiment clad, Haunting the sunless places of the Earth; And mystic legends of his heavenly birth, His many miracles, his piteous death, Were whisper'd by the faithful under breath; And wights grown sick from tearfullest despairs, And many weary souls worn out with cares, Sick men and witless, all who had assailed The gleaming heights of Happiness and failed, But chiefly women bruised and undertrod, Believed this Man indeed the Son of God,— Because he said, “The high shall be estranged, The low uplifted, and the weak avenged, And blest be those who have cast this world away To await the dawning of my Judgment Day!” And straightway many yielded up their lives, Blasphemed their bodies, gash'd their flesh with knives, In attestation that these things were true. And I deny not that to some, a few Poor Souls without a hope, without a friend, The lie brought comfort and a peaceful end; Nor (to be just to him we judge, even him, This Jew, whose presence makes the glad World dim) That often to the martyr in his prison He went and whisper'd “Comfort! I am risen;” Nor that to sickbeds sad, as Death came near, He stole with radiant face and whisper d cheer, And to the Crucified brought secretly The vinegar and sponge of Charity! ‘Yet in the name of those who died for Him, Self-slain, or by the beasts rent limb from limb, Who in his Name with calm unbated breath Went smiling down the dark descent of Death, Who went because he beckon'd with bright hand Out of the mirage of a heavenly Land, I demand justice on their Christ, this Jew! ‘Pass on. From land to land the tidings flew That Christ was God, and that the World was doom'd! Then droopt the lilies of delight, then bloom'd The martyr's rose of blood; Kings on the thrones Cast down their crowns and crawled with piteous moans To the baptismal font where Priests, grown bold, Held high the crucifix wrought round with gold. And soon (how swiftly seeds of evil spring!) They set a Priest on High and crowned him King, Yea, King of all earth's Kings, and next to Christ! There reign'd he, at his will the realms were priced, And each, grown blind to worldly gain and loss, Paid tribute to the King and to the Cross. Behind that King, this Phantom most forlorn Kept watch, from morn to night, from night to morn; And countless Temples rose into the air, Golden and vast and marvellously fair, And artists wrought on canvas and on stone Strange images of Christ upon his Throne Judging the World; and voices filled each land: “Rejoice—the heavenly Kingdom is at hand;” And for a space indeed, so well he feign'd, It seem'd that Christ had conquer'd Death, and reigned. ‘The triumph passed. The poison of the Lie Spread, as all foul things spread beneath the sky; And presently, the time being ripe at last, From shrine to shrine this pallid Phantom pass'd Whispering, “My Word hath grown a wingèd fire, Yet thousands doubt me and blaspheme the Sire— See ye to this, O Priests! seek the abhorred And judge them, with your Master's Flame and Sword.” ‘Look, where the culprit croucheth in his place, Blood on his hands, and terror in his face! Aye, glue your gaze upon him, while I tell Of damnèd deeds and thoughts befitting Hell! . . . . They went abroad, his Priests, like wolves that scent Lambs in the fields, and slew the innocent; The holy Shepherds who in places green To Isis sang and Thammuz songs serene They found and slaughter'd, till their red blood ran In torrents down the streams Egyptian; The gentle Souls who loved their mother Earth, And wept because she had given the Monster birth, They cast in cruel fire, and sacrificed To appease the blood-thirst of this Jew, their Christ! From land to land, from sea to sea, they fled, And where they went the plains were strewn with dead. Then, when all men knelt down and cried in pain “Hosannah to the Lord—for Christ doth reign,” When no man doubted, since he dared not doubt Because of fiends that ringed him round about, When no man breath'd in his own dwelling-house, They paused a little time and held carouse, With full cups pledging Christ; but mark the rest! While they in triumph revelled east and west, He pass'd 'mong them, his chosen, and distilled A fatal poison in the cups they filled, And when thro' vein and thew the poison crept, Like wolves upon each other's throats they leapt, Rending each other in their Master's sight. ‘Next, in the name of Love and Love's delight, And in the name of pagans blest and blind Who loved the old gods best for they were kind, Of virgins who despite the fire and sword Shrank from this Scourge and called on God the Lord, Of haggard men who dared not draw their breath Because they deem'd this man, not Christ, but Death; Yea, in the name of his own Priests profaned Because they did his bidding, and he reigned, I demand justice on their Christ, this Jew. ‘Nay, listen yet. The dark corruption flew Like loathsome pestilence from land to land; From every Altar, raised at his command, Blood dript like dew; grown mad with pride and scorn His Priests cast off the masks that they had worn, And 'neath the Cross, within the very shrines, Held hideous revel with their concubines, Flaunted before their silent Christ thorncrowned The emblems of Priapus, and around Danced naked, with lewd songs and signs obscene; Then the bald monk, upon the convent green, Rolled with the harlot; then the King of Priests In the very Shrine did lewdness worse than beast's, While Incest and foul Lusts without a name Crawl'd in his temples, and he felt no shame. For when the people murmur'd, Priests and Kings Made answer, “Be at peace, ye underlings! Since 'tis enough to deem that Christ is Lord, To adore his symbols and to wield his sword, And all our deeds, tho' black as blackest night, Are vindicated in our Master's sight!” Oh, God that madest Man, if God there be, Didst make these things, didst hear this blasphemy? No writing on the wall disturbed the feasts Of pathic Popes and lep'rous, lech'rous Priests! This Man with falsehoods seventy times seven Defamed Thy world, and Thou wast dumb in Heaven! ‘Now, in the name of vestals sacrificed To feed the lust of those same priests of Christ, Of acolyte children tangled in the mesh Of infamous and nameless filths of flesh, In the name of those whom King and Priest and Pope Cast down to dust, beyond all peace and hope, Yea, in their names who made this Man their guide, And curst by men, by him were justified, I demand justice on their Christ, this Jew! ‘Pass on. With cruel pitiless hand he drew A curtain o'er the azure Heavens above, Hiding the happy Light, darkening the love Which kept life clean and whole; so that in time The very smile of Life became a crime Against his godhead!—Brother turn'd from brother, The father smote his child, the son his mother, And every fire that made home warm and sweet Was trampled into ashes 'neath his feet. Then cried he, “Life itself is shame and sin! Break ye all human ties, and ye shall win My Realm beyond the grave!” and as he cried, Mortals cast ashes on their heads and died, The virgin deem'd that Love's own kiss defiled, The mother's milk was poison'd for the child, The father, worse than beasts who love their young, Cast to the wolves the little ones who clung Crying around his neck; the Anchorite Turn'd from the sunshine and the starry light And hid his head in ordures of self-prayer; The naked Saint loomed black against the air Upon his tower of Famine; and for the sake Of this Man's promise, and the Lie he spake, Nature itself became a blight and ban! Nay, more! thro' all the world corruption ran As from a loathsome corpse—in every clime Disease and Pestilence did shed their slime, Till human Life, once clean and pure and free, Shrank 'neath the serpent-scales of Leprosy! ‘Now in the name of Life defiled and scorn'd, Of hearts that broke because this Phantom warn'd, Of weary mothers desolately dying For sons whose hearts were hardened to their crying, Of wives made husbandless and left unblest, Of little children starving for the breast, Of homes made desolate from sea to sea Because he said “Leave all, and follow me,” I demand justice on their Christ, this Jew! ‘He reign'd where Peace had reign'd!—and no man knew The World wherein he dwelt, nor sought to guess The holy laws of Light and Happiness; Yea, from our sight the beauteous Heavens were veil'd And the Earth under them, while yet Man trail'd His self-wrought chain across the fruitless lands And tore his own pure flesh with impious hands. Then from the depths of sorrow pale men came, Who climb'd the heights and lit thereon the flame Which scatter'd darkness and illumed the skies, And on the stars they fixed their starry eyes And measured their progressions, crying aloud “This Phantom of the Christ is but a cloud Veiling the glory of the Infinite!” What then? His creatures found them in the night And smote them down, and with a fouler fire Made for their martyred bones a funeral pyre That did proclaim his glory and their despair! Even thus the Martyr, Man, once the glad heir Of Earth and Heaven, made with eyes to see And sense to comprehend his Destiny, Was bound and render'd blind, until he fell To Darkness dimly lit by lights of Hell, And there, bereft and desolate of all That made him free, he felt his dungeon wall And wail'd on God; and lo, at this man's nod, His Priests and Kings appear'd, instead of God, Saying “Bow down, thou Slave, and cease thy strife, Confessing on thy knees that Death is Life, And Darkness, Light!”—and to his mouth they thrust Their cruel Cross, defiled with blood and dust; And when he had testified in all men's sight That Death was Life and Darknessheavenly Light, Forth to the fire the shuddering wretch was brought, And slaughter'd to the Lie themselves had taught. ‘Now, in their names, the Souls of priceless worth, Who glorified the lights of Heaven and Earth, Who fathom'd Nature's secret star-sown ways And read the law of Life with fearless gaze, Yet, for reward, with fire were shrivell'd up, Or poison'd by the fatal hemlock-cup, I demand doom and justice on this Jew! ‘Pass o'er the rest—the countless swarmshe slew To appease his lust for life in every land; The happy Nations stricken by his hand With Famine or with Pestilence;—the horde Of butchering Tyrants and of Priests abhorred Who fatten'd on the flesh and blood of men, Because this Jew had died and risen again! Come to the issue. Hear it, Jew, and know Nature hath gather'd strength to lay thee low! Humanity itself shall testify Thy Kingdom is a Dream, thy Word a Lie, Thyself a living canker and a curse Upon the Body of the Universe! For lo, at last, thy Judge, the Spirit of Man And I, his Acolyte since Time began, Have taught thy brethren, things of clay like thee, That all thy prontise was a mockery; That Fatherhood and Godhead there is none, No Father in Heaven and in Earth no Son, That Darkness never can be Light, that still Death shall be Death, despite thy wish or will, That Death alone can comfort souls bereaven And shed on Earth the eternal sleep of Heaven. Yet not until the weary world is free Of all thy ghostly godhead, and of thee, Shall he who stills all tumult and all pain Unveil the happy Heavens once more and reign!’ He ceased, and Jesus heard, but made no sign. Then, gazing sadly on that Man Divine, He added, ‘Peace, and hearken yet, O Jew! For what we come to judge, we pity too! The blessèd sleep Death sheds from sea to sea, Shared by thy brethren, may be shared by thee, If he who sits in Judgment deems it well!’ While on those silent hosts his dark eyes fell, And thro' the Waves of Life that darkly roll'd Around him, ran a tremor deathly cold, He cried, ‘Awake, awake, for 'tis the time! Appear, ye Witnesses of this Man's crime!’ VIII. THE WITNESSES. First to the front a shrouded figure crept, Gazed upon Jesus, hid his face, and wept, Saying, ‘What would ye? Wherefore am I taken Out of the dark grave where I slept forsaken, Forgetting all my heritage of woe?’ ‘What Soul art thou?’ ‘One Judas, named also Iscariot.’ ‘Know'st thou the Accused?’ ‘Aye me. In sooth I know him, to my misery! I followed him, and I believed for long That he was God indeed, serene and strong; Then with an eager hunger famishing To see his Kingdom and to hail him King, I did betray him, thinking “When he stands Bound and condemn'd in the oppressor's hands, When Death comes near to drink his holy breath, He will put forth his power and vanquish Death!” But when I saw him conquer'd, crucified, I hid my face in shame and crept aside, And in the Potter's Field myself I hung.’ ‘Now answer! Was thy spirit consciencestung? Having betrayed him, wherefore didst thou die?’ ‘Because I knew his promise was a lie, Because I knew the Man whom I had slain Was not Messiah—Now, let me sleep again!’ ‘Pass by. The next!’ Forth stept before their sight A form so old, so wan and hoary white, It seem'd another Christ, as old, as sad; And he in antique raiment too was clad, Ragged and wild and his white hair was strewn Like snow around him 'neath the wintry Moon, And by his side a lean she-bear there ran, Gentle and tame uplooking at the man With piteous bleats, while his thin hand was spread With touch as chill as ice upon its head. When on the Accused this old man turned his eyes He shook and would have fled with feeble cries, But a hand held him. Shivering and afraid, He shrank and gazed upon the ground, but stayed. ‘Thy name?’ ‘Ahasuerus. Far away Beyond the changes of the night and day, In the bleak regions of the Frozen Zone, Lit with auroral beams I roamed alone, When a voice called me, and behold I came. ‘Look on the Accused. Know st thou his Form and Name?’ ‘Alack, I know him, as I know my doom— To wander o'er the world without a tomb, Alone, unpitied, hopeless, weak and wild . . . Before my door I stood with wife and child That weary moment when they led him by, Bearing his heavy Cross of Wood, to die. He would have rested at my dwelling-place, But knowing him blasphemer, branded base, Taking the name of God in vain, I cried, “If thou art God, now cast thy Cross aside, And take thy Throne—if thou hast lied pass on!” He turned on me his face all woe-begone, And murmur'd faintly, as he crawl'd away, “Thou shalt not rest until my Judgment Day; Till then walk on from sleepless year to year!” He spake. That doom pursued me. I am here.’ ‘Take comfort, brother. Tho' thy wrongs are deep, When this same Jew is judgèd thou shalt sleep. Pass by.’ With feeble moan and weary pace He went. Another stept into his place. ‘Thou?’ ‘Pilate, to whose Roman judgment seat They brought this Jew, casting him at my feet And clamouring for his life. I smiled to see So mad a thing usurping sovereignty, And said, “O Jews, if so ye list, fulfil The law, and spare or slay him as ye will— The Roman wars not with such foes as he— Upon your heads, not mine, this deed shall be.’ And ere to shameful Death the man was borne, Iturned aside and washed my hands in scorn Of them and him!’ ‘Pass on!’ The Roman cast One pitying look upon the Jew, and pass'd Into the darkness.—As he sank from sight There came in pale procession thro' the night Great Phantoms who the imperial robe did wear, Sceptre in hand, and bayleaves in the hair, Each lewd and horrible and infamous, A monster, yet a man: Tiberius, Sejanus, and the rest; and last of all Came one who trode the earth with light foot-fall, And sang with shrill voice to a golden lute; And lo! a woman's robe from head to foot Enwrapt him, and his face was sickly white With nameless infamies of lewd delight, And on his beardless cheeks mine eyes could see The hideous crimson paint of harlotry, While, in a voice as any eunuch's shrill, He cried: ‘This Jew, their Christ, lay cold and still Within his Sepulchre, and slept supine, While I, the Antichrist, pour'd blood like wine To appease my parasites and paramours! Nay, more, before my shining palace-doors And round the gardens of the feast, I placed The naked forms of men and maidens chaste Who worshipt him, and lit the same to be The living torches of my revelry; And all in vain, thus stript and sacrificed, They called on Christ to conquer Antichrist! In the amphitheatre I sat and smiled On strong men martyred and on maids defiled; Then clad myselfin skins of beasts, and flew To glut my lechery in all men's view, And ravenous-claw'd my bestial lust I fed On shuddering flesh of virgins ravishèd. And yet he rose not! Still and stark he lay. God-like I reign'd, with a god's power to slay, Shame, sadden, gladden. To the old Gods I sang My triumph song that thro' the nations rang While Rome was burning! On my mother's womb I thrust the impious heel! Yet from his tomb This Jesus stirred not! God-like still, I died By mine own hand, not shamed and crucified As he, this Jew, had been!—He lives, ye say? Poor Phantom of the Cross, forlorn and grey, What shall his life avail? His day hath fled, But other Antichrists uplift the head And laugh, and cry “The reign of Christ is o'er! Make merry!”—Yea, the Earth is his no more, His Heaven a Dream, and where he wrought in vain The harlot and the sodomite still reign!’ He spake, and with a shrill and cruel cry Followed his brethren; in his track crept by Pale ghostly Phantoms filleted or crown'd, Imperial harlots with their zones unbound, And haggard children clutch'd yet uncaress'd, Rolling blind eyes and fighting for the breast; And after these a throng of martyrs slain, Bloody and maim'd and worn, who wail'd in pain, Fixing their piteous eyes on that pale Jew. Crowd after crowd they pass'd, and passing threw A curse or prayer on Him who anguish'd there Crown'd with the calm of a divine despair, And one by one He mark'd them come and go While down His wrinkled cheeks deep-sunk in woe The salt tears ran, and ever and anon He hid His face so weary and woe-begone, Or peering vaguely up into the Night Pressèd His skinny hands together tight And moan'd unto Himself! IX. Then saw I rise A shape with broad bold brow and fearless eyes, Behind him as he came a murmuring train Of augurs, soothsayers, and armèd men, With gentle priests of Ceres and of Pan. ‘Room there,’ they cried aloud, ‘for Julian!’ Bareheaded, helm in hand, he took his place Before the Accused, a smile upon his face. ‘Thy name was Julian?’ He answered, ‘Yes! I wore the Imperial robe in gentleness, And looking on the World around my throne I heard the wretched weep, the weary moan, Saw Nature sickening because this Man wrought To scatter poison in the wells of Thought, So that no Soul might live in peace and be Baptised in wisdom and philosophy; Wherefore I summoned from their lonely graves The Spirits of the Mountains and the waves, The tutelary Sprites of flowers and trees, The rough wild Gods and naked Goddesses, And all alive with joy they leapt around My leaf-hung chariot, to the trumpet's sound! Yea, and I wakened from ancestral night The human shapes of Healing and of Light— Asclepios with his green magician's rod, And Aristotle, Wisdom's grave-eyed god, And bade them teach the natural law and prove The eternal verities of Life and Love. What then? I fail'd. This Serpent could elude My priests, however swiftly they pursued, And since I warned them not to slay with steel Nor bruise it cruelly beneath the heel, It lived amid their very footprints, fed On blood and tears, upraised the impious head, Then last, still living on my day of doom, Stung my pale corpse and coil'd upon my tomb! Oh, had I guessed that mercy could not win Blood from the stone, or change the Serpent's skin, That pity and loving kindness ne'er could gain Foothold in Superstition's black domain, Then surely I the avenging sword had bared And slain in mercy what I blindly spared! Twas but a spark! one stamp of foot, and lo! The thing had perished! Fool, to let it grow! So that it grew as such foul hell-fire can, Spreading from City unto City of Man, Turning this World of greenness and sweet breath Into a charnel-house of shameful Death. The Galilean conquered as I threw My last wild jet of life-blood to the blue, Nature resigned her birthright with a groan, And Thought, like Niobe, was turn'd to stone!’ His legions shouted faintly as he cast One glance of scorn on the pale Jew and pass'd To darkness. Following him, methought, there stalked Aurelius, calmly musing as he walked, With many another lesser King of clay, Who paused and testified, then pass'd away; So thick they came from out the troubled dark My brain grew dizzy and I ceased to mark, Until at last a marble Maiden rose, Stript naked to the skin and bruised with blows, Yet fair and golden-haired and azure-eyed She stood erect with fearless gaze, and cried: ‘I was Hypatia. Round my form fell free The white robe of a wise virginity, While in the fountains of the Past I sought Strange pearls of Dream and dim Platonic thought. Now, as I gazed therein, I saw full plain The faces of dead Gods whom men had slain— How fair they seemed! how gentle and how wise! The Spirits of the gladsome earth and skies! And lo, I loved them, and I lit anew Their vestal lamps that men might love them too, And so be passionately purified. The rest ye know. Thro' this same Jew I died. Peter the Reader and his monkish throng Found me and slew me, trail'd my limbs along The streets, and left me, bloody, stark, and dead!’ I watch'd her as with slow and silent tread, Erect tho' naked, cloth'd with chaste cold Light As is the virgin votaress of the Night, She vanished in the darkness. Then for long I marked the Witnesses in shadowy throng Come, say their say, and go; from every side They gathered one by one and testified, And as they testified against the Jew Creation darkened and the murmur grew! Meantime the Accused stood listening, with His eyes Fixed ever sadly on the far-off skies Where flocks of patient stars moved slowly, driven By winds unseen to the dark folds of Heaven,— And ever as His gaze upon it yearned The blue Void quicken'd and new splendours burned, And while the lights of all the stars were shed As lustrous dew upon His hoary head, He knelt and prayed! Then rose a mighty cry Which shook the solid air and rent the sky, And flowing thither came a countless crowd Of women and of men who called aloud ‘Allah il Allah!’—Darkening under Heaven Like to the waves of Ocean tempest-driven, Out of the midnight I beheld them come Up to the Judgment seat and break to foam Of dusky faces and of waving hands; And many raised aloft great crookèd brands And banners where the moonlike crescent burn'd. Then dimly thro' the darkness I discern'd A stately turban'd King, who stood alone; Around his form a prophet's robe was thrown, And in his hand he bore a scimitar Unsheath'd and shining radiant like a star; And on his head there shone a crescent gem, Bright as the moon; and to his raiment-hem Clung women, naked, glorious-eyed, and fair, Houris of Heaven with perfumed golden hair: And the great Sea of Life, that raged and broke Behind him, sank to silence as he spoke, Awed by the gleam of his dark eyes; for lo! He paused not, but moved onward proud and slow, Saying, as past the Judgment Seat he strode, ‘This man cried, “I am Allah! very God!” Yet helpless as a slaughter'd lamb he fell Beneath the angry breath of Azraèl, Great Allah's Angel, sent to avenge his Lord! But I, who raised alike the Cross and Sword, In Allah's name, his Prophet, was content To avow myself the man by Allah sent To do his will in proud humility. So men forgot this Jew, and turn'd to me, Who on the desert-sands my flag unfurled And wrought great miracles to amaze the world! Upon the neck of Kings my foot was set, And all the Nations knew me—Mahomet!’ And at the name the echoing millions roar'd ‘Allah il Allah!—Mighty is the Lord! Mahomet is his prophet!’ Cloud on cloud, Wave following wave, with clash of tumult loud, The mighty Sea of Lives passed onward crying, ‘Allah il Allah!’ and ever multiplying; And when the far-off western horizon Was darkened yet with those who had come and gone, Millions still came from the eastward, sweeping by The Judgment seat with that victorious cry;— And endless seem'd the space of time until The swarms had pass'd, and all again was still,— When, fronting the Accused, the Accuser cried: ‘Greater than this pale Jew men crucified Was he whose mighty star, blood-red and bright, Shines on the minarets of the Islamite!’ But as he spake, out of the East there came One follow'd, too, with clangorous acclaim— A human Shape, wrapt in white lamb-like wool, Star-eyed and sad and very beautiful,— A sceptre in his hand, and on his head A crown of silver, brightly diamonded; Who, flying swift as wind on veilèd feet, Approach'd, and pausing at the Judgment seat, Cried: ‘Sleeping in my Sepulchre, wherein I deem'd myself secure from sense and sin, A voice disturbed me, and awakening, I heard wild voices o'er the Nations ring, Naming the names of lesser gods than I. Deathless I pause, while all the rest pass by— They taught them how to live, I taught them how to die! Heir of the realms of sorrow and despair, I, Gautama, the Buddha, gently bare The Lily, and not the Cross, and not the Sword, And countless thousands hailed me King and Lord! What voices break my rest? What impious strife Stirreth my sleep and brings me back to life?— Yea, plucks me from God's breast, whereon I lay, To take my place again 'mong Kings of clay, Inheritors of Sorrow!’ Even as He spake, the throngs who follow'd bent like grass Wind-blown to worship him! With radiant head He pass'd on, follow'd by the Quick and Dead. And in that train I saw, or seem'd to see, Other inheritors of Deity— His Brethren, Gods or God-like, following: Pale Zoroaster, crownèd like a King; Menú and Moses, each with radiant look Cast on the pages of an open Book; Confucius, in a robe of saffron hue, Enwrought with letters quaint of mystic blue; Prometheus, dragging yet his broken chain, And gazing heavenward still, in beautiful disdain. Ghostwise they testified and vanishèd, These mighty spirits of the god-like Dead; Some reverend and hoary, some most fair, With brightness in their eyes and on their hair, Each kingly in his place, and in his train Souls of fair worshippers that Jew had slain. X. Then, waiting on and watching thro' the gloom, I saw the glimmer of an open Tomb Hewn in the mountain-side, and thence a band Crown'd and tiara'd, each with Cross in hand, Of woeful Phantoms issued, murmuring: ‘We were the Vicars of this Christ, our King! And lo, he let us reign!—and sins like lice Ran o'er us, while we sought with foul device To cloak the living Lie on which we fed!’ And one cried, ‘As I lay upon my bed, My leman at my side, mine hands still red With mine own brother's blood they strangled me!’ And one laugh'd, ‘With this Cross as with a key I open'd up the caves where Monarchs kept Their secret gold!’ And one who wail'd and wept, Yet could not speak, gaped with black jaws forlorn To show the mouth whence the red tongue was torn. And one said, ‘Murder was my handmaiden! I made a Throne with bones of butcher'd men And set her there, and in my Master's name Baptised her!’ And all those others cried again— ‘We were his Vicars, and he bade us reign!’ Back to the Tomb they crept with senile cries, Mumbling with toothless gums and blinking eyes Thick with the rheum of age!—and in their stead Rose shapes of butcher'd Seers whose wounds still bled, And some were clothen with consuming flame As with a garment, crying as they came: ‘We saw all Nature blacken'd far and wide Because this Jew was dead yet had not died, For thro' the world of broken hearts he went Demanding blood and tears for sacrament, Crowning the proud and casting down the just, Lighting the altar-flames of Pride and Lust, Calling the Deadly Sins accurst and dire To be his acolytes and to feed the fire Through which we perish'd; yet we testified With all our Souls against him ere we died!’ O Night of terror! O dark suffering Night, With wounded bleeding heart and great eyes bright With starry portents and serene despairs! I saw them, one by one, the ghostly heirs Of Wisdom and of Woe, the Souls long fled Who died like Him, and like Him are not dead, The Great, the Just, the Good, who cannot die, Because this piteous Phantom passeth by, And when they fain would slumber, murmureth ‘Lo, Christ is God, and God hath vanquish'd Death!’ Like wave on wave they came, like cloud on cloud. Before the Throne stood one wrapt in his shroud, And bearing in his lean uplifted hand, That shook but did not fall, a flaming Brand. The Judge spake (while I dream'd who this might be): ‘Thy name?’ ‘Galileo, of Italy,’ He answer'd; while two other shapes in white Crept to him, on the left hand and the right. ‘These Brethren, standing side by side with me, Wore the white raiment of Philosophy, Yet died in anguish, butcher'd in Christ's name. He on my right hand, Bruno, died by flame. He on my left, Castilio, starved for bread. We saw the Heavenly book above us spread, We pored upon its living lines of fire, And saw therein the Name of God the Sire. Upon us as we ponder'd, thought and prayed, Came this man's Priests and Soldiers, and betrayed Our Souls to torture and to infamy!’ ‘'Tis well. Ye kept your Souls sublime and free, And he who slew you waits for judgment there!’ Suddenly, with a shriek that rent the air, Shadows on shadows throng'd around and cried: ‘We, too, were slain because we testified! Our bones are scattered white in every land! We pass'd the Fiery Torch from hand to hand: Fast as one fell, another raised it high, Till he in turn was smitten down to die. Yet on, from clime to clime, from pole to pole, It pass'd, and lit the Beacons of the Soul, Till wheresoever men could gaze they saw The fiery signs and symbols of the Law, Older than God, which saith the Soul is free!’ The Accuser smiled, and rising quietly, With ominous lifted hand, ‘O Judge,’ he cried, ‘If I should question all men who have died Because this Jew once quickened in the sun, Eternity would pass ere all was done. Enough to know, wherever men have striven To read the open scrolls of Earth and Heaven, Wherever in their sadness they have sought To find the stainless flowers of lonely Thought, Raising the herb of Healing and the bloom Of Love and Joy, this man from out his Tomb Hath stalk'd, and slaying the things their souls deem'd fair Hath poison'd all their peace and stript them bare. Century on century, as men count Time, This man hath been a curse in every clime; So that the World, once the glad home of men, Hath been a prison and a lazar-den, A place of darkness whence no Soul might dare To seek the golden Earth and heavenly air, Save fearfully, with panting lips apart, Fearing the very throb of his own heart As 'twere a death-knell; nay, this Jew set free Disease and Pestilence and Leprosy To crawl like loathsome monsters and destroy Great Cities once alive with life and joy; And of all foul things fouler than the beasts Were this Man's Servants and approven Priests, Stenching the Cities wheresoe'er they trod, Poisoning the fountains in the name of God. Save for this Jew, a thousand years ago Man might have known what he awakes to know— The luminous House of flesh and blood most fair, Rainbow'd from dust and water and sweet air, The green Earth round it, and the Seas that roll To cleanse the Earth from shining pole to pole, The Heavens, and Heavens beyond without a bound, The Stars in their processions glory-crown'd, Each star so vast that it transcends our dreams, So small, a child might grasp it, so it seems, Like a light butterfly! The wondrous screed Of Nature open lay for Man to read; World flashed to world, in yonder Void sublime, The messages of Light and Change and Time; The Sea had voices, and the Spirit of Earth Had sung her mystic runes of Death and Birth, Of all the dim progressions Life had known, And writ them on the rocks in words of stone; Nay, Man's own Soul was as a mirror, bright With luminous changes of the Infinite! And yet Man rested blind beneath the sky Because this Jew said, “Close thine eyes, or die!” Enough—pass onward one by one, ye throng Who sinn'd thro' Christ, or suffer'd shame and wrong; Stay not to speak—your faces shall proclaim, More loud than tongues, your martyrdom and shame!’ Ghostwise they pass'd along before my sight, Martyrs of truth and warriors of the right, Some reverend and hoary, some most fair With sunrise in their eyes and on their hair. So swift they came and fled, I scarce had space To note them, but full many a world-famed face Came like a breaking wave and went again: Justinian, living, yet a corpse, as when They tore him from his tomb; old, gaunt, and grey, The Master of the Templars, Du Molay, Clasp'd by the harlot, Fire,—follow'd by pale And martyr'd warriors bleeding 'neath their mail; Abelard, still erect on stubborn knees Facing the storms of Rome, and Eloise Clad like an abbess, from his eyes of fire Drinking eternal passion and desire; King Frederick, his step serene and strong As if he trod on altars, with his throng Of warriors, Christian and Saracen; Great Algazalli and wise Alhazen, White-robed and clam, with many a lesser man Wrapt in the peace of lore Arabian; Pale Petrarch, laurel-crownèd, gazing on The white face of that sister woe-begone Who thro' the lust of Christ's own Vicar fell; John Huss, still wrapt around with fires of Hell, Clutching the Book he bore with piteous tears. Silent they pass'd, the Martyrs and the Seers, Known and unknown, the Heirs of love and praise; And last the Three who with undaunted gaze Faced the great Ocean of Earth's mystery, Mighty and strong as when from sea to sea They sail'd and sail'd: De Gama following Columbus, who with sea-bird's sleepless wing Flew on from Deep to Deep; and, mightiest, Magellan, faring forward on his quest, Putting the craven cowls of Rome to shame, And lighting Earth and Heaven with his resplendent name! XI. With woe unutterable, and pity vast As the still Heaven on which His eyes were cast, That old Jew listen'd, while new voices cried, ‘We too were slain because we testified!’ But as they pass'd along with waving brands Beneath Him, He outstretch'd His trembling hands As if to bless them, murmuring low yet clear, ‘Father in Heaven, where art Thou? Dost Thou hear?’ And at the voice those Spirits cried again, ‘We testified against thee and were slain!’ And never down on them His eyes were turn'd, But still upon the silent Heaven that yearn'd Its heart of stars out on His hoary head. Even as a shipwrecked wight doth cling in dread To some frail spar, and seeth all around The dark wild waters swelling without bound, While momently the black waves flash to foam, Ev'n so I saw the spirits go and come With piteous cries around me. From all lands They gathered, moaning low and waving hands, Women and men and naked little ones; And some were dusky-hued from flaming suns That light the West and East; for lo, I knew The hosts of Ind, the children of Peru, And the black seed of Ham; and following these, Wan creatures bearing hideous images Of wood and stone; yellow and black and red, They gathered, murmuring as they came, and fled! And all the air was troubled, as when the rain Maketh the multitudinous leaves complain In some deep forest solitude, with the stirs Of tutelary gods and worshippers, Of creatures thronging thick as ants to upbuild Strange Temples, frail as ant-heaps, faintly filled With the first gleams of godhead chill and grey, Then crumbling into dust and vanishing away! Borne on a purple litter came a King Gold-crown'd, with eager armies following Swift-footed like the pard, crested with plumes Of many-colour'd birds, and deck'd with blooms Of many-colour'd flowers; and as he came Choirs of dark maidens sang in glad acclaim, ‘All hail to Montezuma, King and Lord!’ And round him dusky Priests kept fierce accord Of drums and cymbals, till their lord was borne Close to the Throne; and on that Man forlorn Fixing his sad, brown, antelope's eyes, and lying Like to a stricken deer sore-spent and dying, He cried: ‘In the grassy West I reigned supreme O'er a great kingdom wondrous as a dream. As high as Heaven rose my palaces, And fair as Heaven was the light in these, And out of gold I ate, and gold and gems Cover'd me to the very raiment-hems, And gems and gold miraculously bright Illumed my roofs and floors with starry light. The wondrous lama-wool as white as milk, More soft and snowy than the worm's thin silk, Was woven for my raiment; unto me The creatures of the Mountains and the Sea Were brought in tribute; and from shore to shore My naked couriers flew for ever, and bore My mandate to the lesser Kings, my slaves; Yea, and my throne was on a thousand graves, And Death, obedient to my lifted hand, Smiled peacefully upon a golden Land. There, as I reigned, and millions bles{'d my sway, Came rumours of a fair God far away Greater than those I worshipt, till my throne Shook at the coming of that form unknown; And o'er the Ocean, borne on flying things That caught the winds and held them in their wings, Riding on manèd monsters that obeyed Bridles of gold and champ'd the bit and neigh'd, Came this Man's followers, clad and shod with steel, Trampling my naked hosts with armèd heel And raising up the Cross; and me they found Within my shining palace sitting crown'd, 'Mid priests and slaves that trembled at my nod, And bade me worship him, their pale white God, Nailèd upon a Tree and crucified; And when upon mine own strong gods I cried, They answer'd not! nay, even when I was cast Unto the dust, bound like a slave at last, Still they were dumb; and tho' my people arose Innumerable, they were scattered even as snows Before the wintry blast; with sword and spear The bloody Spaniard hunted them like deer, So that my realm ran blood in this Man's name; And lo! my proud heart broken with its shame, I died to all my glory, and lay mute, Defiled, and scorn'd, beneath the Spaniard's foot, And all my Kingdom fell to nothingness.’ He pass'd, and after him came Monarchs less Than he, yet proud and mighty,—I watch'd them fly Like flocks of antelopes beneath the sky, And harrying them the Hunters clad in mail Follow'd, with cruel faces marble pale, Lifting the Cross, and speeding fast beyond My sight, on steeds with gold caparison'd. Nor ceased the pageant yet. Sceptred and crown'd, A King, with plumèd legions wailing round, Stood up and cried: ‘The splendour of the Sun Illumed the Temples where my rites were done, And to the Sun-god who for ever gazed With face of gold upon my realm, I raised The pæan and the prayer. Beneath my rule The happy lands grew bright and beautiful, And countless thousands innocent of strife Bless'd me, and that refulgent Fount of Life. Fairer my palaces and temples far In sight of Heaven than Morn or Even Star, For in them dwelt the quickening Light of him Before whose glory every sphere is dim! Yea, but at last mine eyes did gaze upon A blood-star, rising o'er the horizon Out eastward, and before its baleful ray The Sun-god shrivel'd and was driven away; And leagued with iron monsters belching fire, And riding living monsters tame yet dire, Out from the gulfs of sudden blackness pour'd A mailèd band who called this man their Lord, And slew us ev'n as sheep, and undertrod The shining temples of the Sun, our God; Me too they smote and slaughter'd, offering me, Last of the Incas, to their Deity— And Darkness reign'd where once the Light had shone!’ Wailing, he wrung his hands and wander'd on, And after him like bleeding sheep a train Of naked slaughter'd things that sob'd in pain— 'Midst them a dusky woman richly dress'd Who wrung her hands and smote her naked breast Crying, ‘I loved the soldier of this Jew, And me he lusted for, then foully slew, And wheresoe'er his Cross waved overhead Came shrieks of women torn and ravishèd!’ And round her as she spake those butcher'd bands Of women smote their breasts or wrung their hands. ‘O shadowy crowds of men,’ the Accuser cried, ‘Dark naked women, children piteous-eyed, All manacled and bleeding, worn and weak, How do ye testify against him? Speak!’ ‘Because,’ they said, ‘the radiant summer Light Had burnt our bodies and made them black yet bright, Altho' our hearts within were sweet and mild, We suffered sorrow, man and wife and child. Far in the West we prayed, bending the knee In Cities fairer far than Nineveh, And high as Heaven arose fair Palaces Lit with the many-colour'd images Of gentle gods,—but on our shores there came Devils that smote us in this white God's name, Our gods dethroned, our temples overcast, And scattered us as chaff before the blast. This Jew looked on. His Priests piled gold, while we Were basely slain or sold to slavery; Tears worse than blood we shed, and bloodiest sweat, While on the soil, with blood of millions wet, They did upraise his church that rose on high With fiery finger pointing at the sky Where every happy star had ceased to shine!’ XII. ‘Thou hearest, Jew?’ But Jesus made no sign. With woe unutterable and pity vast As the still Heaven on which His eyes were cast, He listen'd dumbly, while new voices cried, ‘We too were slain, and by his Priests we died!’ And like to cloud on cloud, blown by the wind And broken, dusky swarms of Humankind Still came and went; and then rose wailing crowds Who bare the lighted candle, and in their shrouds Walk'd naked-footed to the martyr's pyre; With men whose entrails Famine's hidden fire Gnaw'd till they shriek'd aloud; and every-where A cruel scent of carnage filled the air, As countless armèd legions of the slain Roll'd up as if for battle once again, While o'er them, flaming between earth and sky, The crimson Cross was swung! All these pass'd by; Then Silence deep as Death fell suddenly, And all was hushèd as a rainy Sea! Then came a rush of hosts mingled in storm Confusedly, and phantoms multiform That shriek'd and smote each other. ‘Behold them,’ cried The Accuser, ‘Followers of the Crucified! The ravening wolves of wrath that never sleep, Yet seek his fold and call themselves his sheep! Where'er they strive, Murder and Madness dwell, And Earth is lighted with the hates of Hell! Lo, how they love each other, having heard The crafty gospel of his broken Word! Lo, how they surge in everlasting strife, Seeking the mirage of Eternal Life!’ Struggling unto the Judgment-place they came, Smiting each other in their Master's Name; Beneath their feet fell women stab'd and cleft, And little children anguishing bereft. And like a River of Blood that ever grew, They rush'd until they roll'd round that pale Jew, And lo! His feet grew bloody ere He was 'ware! Yet still they smote each other, and in despair Shriek'd out His praises as they multiplied Their dead around Him . . . And thus they testified! And He, the Man Forlorn, stood mute in woe. I saw the white corpse of the Huguenot Float past Him on that dreadful Sea of Lives; I saw the nun struck down and gash'd with knives Ev'n as she told her beads; I saw them pass, The Martyrs of the Book or of the Mass, Cast down and slain alike; the priest of Rome Fought with the priest of Luther, thrusting home With venomous knife or sword; and evermore The Cross of Blood was wildly waven o'er The waves of carnage, till they swept from sight, Moaning and rushing onward thro' the Night. Then, as the Storm seem'd weeping itself away, I saw two ghostly Spirits ooming grey Against that dark Golgotha, and one of these Clung to the other, and sank upon his knees. ‘What man art thou?’ ‘Jean Calas.’ ‘He whose hands Thou, kneeling, wettest with thy tears; who stands Smiling upon the Accused?’ The last replied: ‘Voltaire the people named me. I denied The godhead of that Jew, and at his brow Pointed in mockery and scorn, as now! Pope, Kings, and Priests shiver'd like frighten'd birds Before the rain and lightning of my words, And crouch'd with draggled plumage, awed and dumb, Because they deem'd that Antichrist had come. One day I heard this man in his poor home Shriek loud, encircled by the snakes of Rome; And tho' their poison slew him, ere he died I crush'd the vipers 'neath my heel, and cried “Thy woes shall be avengèd; I am here!” Even then a million wretches cast off fear, And looking on this man's seed, redeem'd by me, Fear'd the foul Christ no longer, and grew free!’ Thin, gaunt and pale, around his lips the ray Of a cold scorn, he smiled and pass'd away, His eyes upon the Jew; and with him went Dark silent men whose musing eyes were bent On open scrolls; and 'mong them laughing stood A King who held a mimic Cross of wood, And broke it o'er his knee, with a fierce jest; So pass'd they, Holbach, Diderot, and the rest, The foes of Godhead and the friends of Man; But after them great crowds in tumult ran, Who waved their dark and blood-stain'd arms and shriek'd, ‘We, who had lain in darkness, rose and wreak'd Man's wrath on this false God, who had scorn'd our prayer And sent his Kings and slaves to strip us bare! Yea, in his Name the Harlots and the Priests Yoked us and harness'd us like blinded beasts; And when we cried for food they profferèd The stones of his cold Gospel and not bread; And where his blessing fell the foul found gold, And where it fell not we were bought and sold. His foot was on the heads beneath him bowed, His hand was with the pitiless and the proud, His mercy failed us, but the curse he gave Pursued our spirits even beyond the grave. Thus he who had promised love gave only hate! He spake of Heaven and made Earth desolate! Thou didst at last avenge us, Spirit of Man, Through thee the Night was cloven and Day began, And on thine altars blood as sacrament Appal'd the Kings of Earth this God had sent!’ Then once again the Accuser rose and cried: ‘The countless hosts of Dead have testified; But lastly, to this solemn Judgment-place, I summon up the seed of this Man's race; Bear witness now, ye Jews, against this Jew!’ XIII. Then instantly, as if some swift hand drew A curtain back, the Darkness of the Night Was cloven, and thronging in the starry light New legions of the ghostly Dead appear'd And ever, as the Judgment Seat they near'd, They shriek'd ‘Messiah;’ and with lips apart Startled as if a knife had prick'd His heart, That pale Jew listen'd and His wan face turn'd To those who cried; but when those hosts discern'd His human lineaments they shriek'd anew: ‘One God we worship, and this Man we slew, Seeing he took the Holy Name in vain! And since that hour that he was justly slain, His hate hath followed us from place to place! Wherefore, O Judge, we, children of his race, Scorn'd, tortured, shamed, defamed, defiled, and driven Outcast from every gate of Earth or Heaven, Still martyr'd living and still dishonour'd dead, Demand thy wrath and judgment on his head, Jesus the Jew, not Christ, but Antichrist!’ Dumb as a lamb brought to be sacrificed, Helpless and bound, He listen'd—still with gaze Fix'd on the starry azure's pathless ways, But down His cheeks, furrow'd with weary years, Slowly and softly fell the piteous tears. Like hordes of wolves, fierce, foul, and famishing, That round some lonely Traveller shriek and spring, Black'ning the snows around his lonely path, Rending each other in their hungry wrath, The children of the Ghetto, gathering there, His brethren, fed their eyes on His despair And spat their hate upon Him; and the snow Was sooted with these nameless shapes of woe; But hither and thither 'mid the ravening horde Moved Rabbis who lookt upward and adored The Lord of Hosts, with hoary Saints and Seers, And dark-eyed Maids who sang with sobs and tears Of God's bright City overthrown in shame, Jerusalem the golden!—and at the Name The woeful throngs who roll'd in tumult by Rent robes, and wail'd, and echoed back the cry ‘Jerusalem! Jerusalem!’—and lo! From 'midst the multitudinous ebb and flow That ever came and went, there did arise A Prophet, with white beard and burning eyes, Saying, ‘Holy, Holy still, thy Name shall be, Jerusalem, thro' God's Eternity! For tho' thy glory hath fallen, and thy gate Lies broken, and thy streets are desolate, And on thy head ashes and dust are flung, And in thy folds the wolf suckles her young, Thou shalt arise in splendour and in pride, And we, thy people, shall be justified; Our tents are scattered, and our robes are riven, Like chaff before the blast our race hath driven In darkness, ever homeless, thro' the lands, But never another City by our hands Hath been upbuilded, since where'er we roam Thou, City of God, art still our Hope and Home! And tho' with bitterest tears our eyes are dim, We hearken ever for the call of Him Who thundered upon Sinai! . . . In thy breast This Snake who stings thee still doth make his nest! This Son who smote thee, Mother, still doth lie Within thine arms; but o'er thee, yonder on high, Watches the God of Jacob! Patience yet! Tho' for a little space thy sun hath set, As red as blood it shall arise again For vengeance, and the God of Wrath shall reign, With thee, his Bride long chosen, and over us, Thy children!’ Thronging multitudinous, With one great voice they answered: ‘Holy be Thy Name, Jerusalem, thro' Eternity!’ And now their wailings sobb'd themselves to calm, While to a sound of harps and lutes the psalm Of Israël rose to Heaven—‘Holy be Thy Name, Jerusalem, thro' Eternity!’ XIV. Then said that Form who sat in Judgment: ‘Jew! Once judged and slain, yet risen and judged anew, Thou hast heard the Accuser and his Witnesses. Hast thou a word to utter answering these? Hast thou a living Soul beneath the sky To rise upon thy side and testify? Summon thy Witnesses, if such there be, Ere I pronounce the doom of Man on thee!’ The Jew gazed round, and wheresoe'er His gaze Shed on that throng its gentle suffering rays Tumult and wrath were hush'd, as in deep Night Great waves lie down to lap the starry light And lick the Moon's cold feet that touch the Sea. ‘I have no word to answer,’ murmured He, ‘The winter of mine age hath come, and lo! My heart within sinks 'neath its weight of woe! So faint and far-removed all seems to be, I seem the ghost of mine own Deity, The apparition of myself, and not A living thing with will or strength or thought! Yet I remember’ (here His piteous eyes Search'd the bare Heavens again with dim surmise) ‘Yet I remember, on this my Judgment Day, Not what is near, but what is far away. Within my Father's House I fell to sleep In dreamless slumber mystical and deep, And when I waken'd to mine own faint crying, Above the cradle small where I was lying A Mother's face hung like a star, and smiled. ‘Transform'd into the likeness of a child, Feebly I drank the milk of mortal being; But as the green world brightened to my seeing And the round are of air closed over me, The Land beyond grew dark to memory, And I forgot my former dwelling-place, The Life Eternal, and my Father's Face. Closer and darker, as the summers flew, The folds of flesh around my spirit grew, Shutting that heavenly Mansion from my sight, Save oftentimes in visions of the night When for a space I slept the sleep of earth; But since that moment of my mortal birth, I have not seen my Father, and now He seems More faint than any form beheld in dreams!’ He paused, uplifting still His weary gaze To search the empty Heaven's pathless ways For miracle and token, then was dumb. ‘Thy quest hath fail'd, thy Kingdom hath not come,’ The dark Judge said; ‘thy promise was a Lie— Thy Witnesses?’ And Jesus made reply: ‘Hosts of the happy Dead whom I have blest!’ ‘Call—let them come!’ ‘I would not break their rest.’ ‘Thou hast lied to them, O Jew!’ the dark Judge cried. And Jesus said, ‘O Judge, I have not lied!’ ‘False was thy promise—false and mad and drear. There is no Father!’ ‘Father, dost Thou hear?’ ‘Enough—renew thy miracles, and prove Thy words, O Jew! From yonder Void above Summon the Form, the Face, in all men's eyes, And we absolve thee!’ On the starry skies, Still thinly shrouded with the falling snow, He fix'd His wistful gaze, and answer'd low, ‘I bide my Father's time!’ XV. Then, as He bent His brow like one who kneels for sacrament, And on His feeble form and hoary head The benediction of the Night was shed, Methought I saw a Shape behind Him stand, Grim as a godhead graven in brass, his hand Uplifted, and his wrinkled face set stern, While terrible his deep black eyes did burn In scornful wrath. Naked as any stone He stood, save for a beast's skin loosely thrown Around his dusky shoulders, and he said: ‘Thy Witnesses?—Lord of the Quick and Dead, Call them, and they shall come! I first, who stood And prophesied by Jordan's rolling flood, And saw thee shining o'er the throng on me Thro' the white cloud of thy Humanity, And knew thee in a moment by those eyes Full of the peace of our lost Paradise! Master and Lord of Life, these hands of mine Baptized thee, blest thee, hailed thee most Divine, Long promised, the Messiah!—and tho' thy brow Is furrowed deep with years, I know thee now, And in the name of all thou wast and art, God's substance, of the living God a part, Bear witness still, as I bare witness then, Before this miserable race of men!’ Then saw I, as he ceased and stood aside, Another Spirit fair and radiant-eyed, Who, creeping thither, at the Jew's feet fell, And looking up with love ineffable Cried ‘Master!’ and I knew that I beheld, Tho' his face, too, was worn and grey with eld, That other John whom Jesus to His breast Drew tenderly, because He loved him best! But even as I gazed, my soul was stirred By other Shapes that stole without a word Out of the silent dark, and kneeling low Stretchèd out loving hands and wept in woe: The gentle Mother of God grown grey and old, Her silver hair still thinly sown with gold, Mary the wife, and Mary Magdalen Who murmur'd ‘Lord, behold thy Hand-maiden,’ And kiss'd His feet, her face so sadly fair Hid in the shadows of her snow-strewn hair; And close to them, as thick as stars appear'd Faces of children brightening as they near'd The presence of their Father; and following these Pallid Apostles falling upon their knees, Crying ‘Messiah!—Master—we are here!’ As some poor famish'd wight doth take good cheer Seeing an open door and one who stands Upon the threshold with outstretchèd hands That welcome him to some well-laden board, That Wanderer brightened, while they murmur'd ‘Lord! We are thy Witnesses in all men's sight!’ Feebly yet happily He rose His height, And even as a Shepherd grave and old Who smiles upon his flock within the fold, He shone upon them till that sad place seemed Fair as a starry night, and still they stream'd Out of the shadows, passionately crying Upon the Name Beloved and testifying, Till the dark Earth forgot its sorrowing And grew as glad as Heaven opening! Then one cried (and I knew him, for his face Was dark and proud, yet lit with dews of grace, And like an organ's peal his strong voice rang With solemn echoes as of Saints that sang), ‘Thy Witnesses? Father of all that be, I persecuted those who followed thee, Thy remnant, till thy fire from out the sky Smote me, and as I fell I heard thee cry, “Saul, Saul!”—and shook as at the touch of Death; But on my face and eyelids came thy breath To make me whole; and lo! I sheathed the sword And girded up my loins to preach thy Word. And the World listen'd, while the heathen praised Thy glory, and believed; and I upraised Temples of marble where thy flocks might pray, And where no Temple was from day to day I made the Earth thy Temple, and the sky A roof for thy Belovèd. Lamb of God, Thy blood redeemed the Nations, while I trode The garden of thy gospel, bearing thence Strange flowers of Love and holy Innocence, And setting up aloft for all to see Thy Hûleh lilies, Faith, Hope, Charity; And of these three I knew the last was best Because, like thee, dear Lord, 'twas low-liest! Thy Witnesses? Countless as desert sands Their bones are scatter'd o'er the seas and lands! Whene'er the Lamp of Life hath sunken low, Whene'er Death beckon'd and 'twas time to go, Where'er dark Pestilence and Disease had crawl'd, Where'er the Soul was darken'd and appal'd, Where mothers wept above their dead first-born, Where children to green graves brought gifts forlorn Of flowers and tears, where, struck 'spite helm and shield, Pale warriors moan'd upon the battlefield, Where Horror thicken'd as a spider's mesh Round plague-smit men and lepers foul of flesh, Where Love and Innocence were brought to shame, And Life forgot its conscience and its aim, Thy blessing, even as Light from far away, Came bright and radiant upon eyes of clay And turn'd the tears of pain to tears of bliss! Nay, more, to Death tself thy loving kiss Brought consecration; he, that Angel sad, Ran like a Lamb beside thee, and was glad Uplooking in thy face!’ He ceased, and lo! Like warriors gathering when the trumpets blow, Shapes of dead Saints arose, a shining throng, And standing in their shrouds upraised the song ‘Hosannah to the Lord!’—Faint was the cry Withering on the wind as if to die, And loud as clarion-winds above the sound Shrill'd the fierce anger of the hosts around; And while before the Storm His head was bowed They rose like ocean waves and clamour'd aloud For judgment on the Jew! XVI. Far as the sight Could penetrate the blackness of the Night, Stretchèd the multitudinous living Sea, The angry waters of Humanity, And lo! their voice was as the ocean's roar Thund'rously beating on some sleepless shore; And He, the Man Divine, whose eyes were dim With shining down on those who worshipt Him, Seem'd as a lonely pharos on a rock, Firm in its place, yet shaken by the shock, And ever blinded by the pitiless foam Of waves that surge and thunder as they come! And as I have seen, on some lone oceanisle Where never Summer lights or flowers may smile, But where the fury of the Tempest blows, The ocean birds in black and shivering rows Huddle along the rocks; now one, alone, Plunges upon the whirlwind, and is blown Hither and thither as a straw, and then Struggles back feebly to his rocky den, There still to shiver and eye the dreadful flood And with his comrades hungering for food Ruffle the feathery crest and brood in fear:— Ev'n so, those lonely Saints who gather'd near The Man forlorn, seem'd to the Sea of Life Which rose around with ceaseless stress and strife, And ever one of these, as if to face The angry blast, would flutter from his place, And driven hither and thither be backward blown, And fall again with faint despairing moan At his sad Master's feet! Then as the Storm Raged ever louder round His lonely form, The Jew uplifted hands and cried aloud! And in a moment, Darkness like a cloud Cover'd Him, the great whirlwinds ceased to roar, And all those Waves of Life were still once more. XVII. Then said that Form who sat in Judgment there: ‘Ye saw a mirage and ye thought it fair, He brought a gospel and ye found it sweet, Yea, deemed it heavenly manna and did eat, Yet were ye empty still and never fed. This man has given ye husks to eat, not bread. He said “There is no Death!” yet Death doth reign. He promised you a gift no man may gain, Yea, Life that shall endure eternally, And told ye of a God no eye shall see, Because He is not! Bid him lift his hand And show the Life Divine and Heavenly Land, Bid him arise and take his Throne and reign! He cannot, for he knoweth he dream'd in vain, And empty of his hope he stands at last, Now the full measure of his power hath pass'd. Not yours the sin, poor Shadows of the Dead, Not yours the shame, which rests upon his head As dust and ashes. Back to your graves, and sleep! We judge the Shepherd, not the blameless sheep Who gather'd on the heights to hear his voice Cry down to deep on deep “Rejoice! rejoice!” Fringe of his raiment that is riven and rent, Breath of his nostrils that is lost and spent, Thin echoes of his voice from out the tomb, Go by. This man is ours, to judge and doom.’ He spake; and quietly, without a word, The Christ bow'd down His head, but those who heard, His remnant, wringing hands and making moan, Cried: ‘Lord, thou hearest? Speak—and take thy Throne! Still these wild waters of Humanity, Walking thereon, as once on Galilee! Our graves lie open yonder, but we are fain To wake with thee and never to sleep again— Unfold thy Heavens, and bid these clouds give place, That we may look upon the Father's face!’ And Jesus answer'd not, but shook and wept. Then the grey Mother to His bosom crept, And with her thin hands touch'd His sad grey hair, Saying, ‘My Son, My First-born! Let me share Thy failure or Thy glory! Free or bound, Cast down into the dust or throned and crown'd, Thou art still my Son!’ and kneeling at His feet, That other Mary, gazing up to meet The blessing of His eyes, cried ‘Holy be Thy Name, for all the joy it brought to me! Not for thy Godhead did I hold thee dear, Not for thy Father, who hath left thee here Helpless, unpitied, homeless 'neath the skies, But for the human love within thine eyes! And wheresoe'er thou goest, howsoe'er Thou fallest, tho' it be to Hell's despair, I, thy poor handmaid, still would follow thee, For in thy face is Love's Eternity, And tho' thou art of all the World bereaven, Still, where thou art, Belovèd, there is Heaven!’ As some white Alpine peak, wrapt round with cloud, Suddenly sweeps aside its clinging shroud Of gloomy mists and vapours dark and chill, And shines in lonely splendour clear and still, With gleams of stainless ice and snow thrice shriven, Against the azure of the opening Heaven, So that the soul is shaken unaware With that new glory desolately fair,— E'en so the Christ, uprising suddenly To loneliness of lofty sovereignty, Cast off the darkness of despair and tower'd High o'er the shadows that beneath Him cower'd! Then all was hush'd, while on His hoary head Light from a million spheres was softly shed, Fire from a million worlds that lit the Night Fell on His face miraculously bright, And even that Judge who watch'd Him from afar Seem'd but a storm-cloud shrinking 'neath a Star! And thus, while heavenly anger lit His cheek As still sheet-lightning lights the snowy peak, He answered: ‘Woe! eternal Woe! be yours Who scorn the Eternal Pity which endures While all things else pass by! Your lips did thirst— I brought ye water from the Founts which burst Beneath the bright tread of My Father's feet! Ye hunger'd, and I brought ye food to eat— Manna, not husks or ashes: these ye chose, And me, the living Christ, ye bruised with blows And would have slain once more, and evermore! Ye revell'd, and I moan'd without your door Outcast and cold; ye sinnèd in my Name, And flung me then the raiment of your shame; Ye turn'd the heart of the Eternal One 'Gainst you, his children, and 'gainst me, his Son, So that my promise grew a dream forlorn, And all I sow'd in love, ye reapt in scorn. Woe to ye all! and endless Woe to Me Who deem'd that I could save Humanity! The Father knew men better when he sent His angel Death to be his instrument And smite them ever down as with a sword! Instead of Death, I offer'd ye my Word! My Light, my Truth, my Life!—I wasted breath, For though I gave ye these, ye turn'd to Death! And I, your Lord, for love of you, denied My soul the sleep it sought, and rose to guide Your footsteps to the Land we ne'er shall gain, Because at last I know my Dream was vain! I plough'd the rocks, and cast in rifts of stone The seeds of Life Divine that ne'er have grown; I labour'd and I labour, last and first, Within a barren Vineyard God hath curst; And now the Winter of mine age is here, And one by one like leaves ye disappear, While I, a blighted Tree, abide to show The Woe of all Mankind, the eternal Woe Which I, your Lord, must share!’ Even so He spake, Pallid in wrath; but as low murmurs wake Under the region of the Peak, and rise To thunders answered from the thund'ring skies, While cataract cries to cataract, and o'er-head Heaven darkens into anger deep and dread, Cries from the shadowy legions answer'd Him, Wild voices wail'd, and all the Void grew dim, With cloud on cloud. So that serene sad Face Was blotted out of vision for a space, And out of darkness on that radiant form Sprang the fierce pards and panthers of the Storm! Then the Earth trembled, and the crimson levin Shot swift and lurid o'er the vaults of Heaven, And thunder answer'd thunder with crash on crash As beast doth beast, but at each lightning-flash I saw Him standing pale and terrible, Unscath'd yet swathen as with fire from Hell! But lo, from out the darkness round His feet There came a voice most passionately sweet Crying ‘Adonai! Lord! Forgive us, even Altho' our sins be seventy times seven! Comfort the remnant of thy flock and bless Thy Well Belovèd!’—and my Soul could guess Whose voice had called, for at the voice's sound He trembled and He reach'd towards the ground With eager trembling hands; and at the touch Of her who had loved not wisely, but too much, His force fell from Him, and He wept aloud, While heavily His hoary head was bowed In utter impotence of Deity! XVIII. Even then, methought, that angry living Sea Surged round Him, and again I did discern The Phantoms of Golgotha!—Soldiers stern Who pointed with their spears and pricked Him on, While on His shoulders drooping woe-be-gone They thrust the great black Cross! Upon His head A crown of thorns was set, and dript its red Dark drops upon His brow, while loud they cried ‘Lo, this is Jesus whom we crucified, And lo, he hath risen, and shall die once more!’ And as a waif is cast on some dark shore By breaking waves of Ocean and is ta'en Back by the surge again and yet again, Even so the Man was tost, till He lay prone, Breathless, a ragged heap, beneath the Throne. Golgotha! Like the very Hill of Death, Skull-shapen, yet a living thing of breath, The dark Judge loom'd, with orbs of fateful flame, And motion'd back the crying crowd that came Shrieking for judgment on that holy head; And lo, they faltered back! Then the Voice said ‘Arise, O Jew!’ And Jesus rose. ‘Again Take up thy Cross!’ Calm, with no moan of pain, Jesus took up the Cross. While 'neath its load He shook as if to fall, His white hair snow'd Around His woeful face and wistful eyes! While thus He stood, bowed down in pain, the cries Of those who loved Him pierced His suffering heart. Trembling He heard again, with lips apart And listening eyes, the faithful remnant moan: ‘Adonai! Lord and Master! Take thy Throne And claim thy Kingdom!’ but with clamorous sound Of laughter fierce and mad the cry was drowned, And at His naked breast the forkèd light Stabb'd like a knife, while thro' the gulfs of Night The thunders roar'd! Trembling at last He rose, And as a wind-smit tree shakes off the snows That cling upon its boughs, He gatherèd His strength together, and with lifted head Gazed at His Judge; and lo, again the storm Of darkness ebbed away and left His Form Serene and luminous as an Alpine peak Shining above these valleys! On His cheek The sheeted light gleam'd softly, while on high The silent azure open'd like an eye And gazed upon Him, pitilessly fair. So round about Him as He waited there Silence like starlight fell, till suddenly, Like surge innumerable of one great Sea, A million voices moaned, ‘Speak now His Doom!’ XIX. Then, pointing with dark finger thro' the gloom On Him who stood erect with hoary head, The Judge gazed down with dreadful eyes, and said: ‘Ere yet I speak thy Doom that must be spoken Before the World whose great heart thou hast broken, Hast thou another word to say, O Jew?’ And the Jew answer'd, while the heavenly blue Fill'd like an eye with starry crystal tears, ‘Far have I wander'd thro' the sleepless years— Be pitiful, O Judge, and let me die!’ ‘Death to him, Death!’ I heard the voices cry Of that great Multitude. But the Voice said: ‘Nay! Death that brought peace thyself didst seek to slay! Death that was merciful and very fair, Sweet dove-eyed Death that hush'd the Earth's despair, Death that shed balm on tirèd eyes like thine, Death that was Lord of Life and all Divine, Thou didst deny us, offering instead The Soul's fierce famine that can ne'er be fed— Death shall abide to bless all things that be, But evermore shall turn aside from thee— Hear then thy Doom!’ He paused, while all around The Sea of Life lay still without a sound, And on the Man Divine, Death's King and Lord, The sacrament of heavenly Light was pour'd. ‘Since thou hast quicken'd what thou canst not kill, Awaken'd famine thou canst never still, Spoken in madness, prophesied in vain, And promised what no thing of clay shall gain, Thou shalt abide while all things ebb and flow, Wake while the weary sleep, wait while they go, And treading paths no human feet have trod Search on still vainly for thy Father, God; Thy blessing shall pursue thee as a curse To hunt thee, homeless, thro' the Universe; No hand shall slay thee, for no hand shall dare To strike the godhead Death itself must spare! With all the woes of Earth upon thy head, Uplift thy Cross, and go. Thy Doom is said.’ XX. And lo! while all men come and pass away, That Phantom of the Christ, forlorn and grey, Haunteth the Earth with desolate foot-fall. . . . God help the Christ, that Christ may help us all! The Devil's Case. NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME CORRECTLY STATED, AND DILIGENTLY VERSIFIED, AS A BANK HOLIDAY INTERLUDE. (1894.) Please remember, Gentle Reader, Not to judge me line by line: Tho' I try to state it clearly, 'Tis the Devil's Case, not mine! DEDICATION. November, 1894. When the life-thread was spun From the blood in her breast, She look'd on her Son, Smiled, and rock'd him to rest. . . . How swift the Hours run From the East to the West Erect stood the Son, And the Mother was blest. Of all Life had won Love like his seem'd the best: He was still the dear Son She had rock'd on her breast! Yet lo! all is done! ('Twas, O God, Thy behest!) In his turn the gray Son Rocks the Mother to rest! All is o'er, ere begun! . . . . O my dearest and best, Sleep in peace,—till thy Son Creepeth down to thy breast! R. B. THE DEVIL'S CASE. I. Would you know how I, Buchanan, Met the Devil here in London, Chatted with him, interview'd him? Listen, then, and you shall hear! Not in great heroic measures Shall I sing on this occasion, But in roguish rhymeless stanzas Much esteem'd by Greeks and Germans. Genius of the Greeks and Germans, Lend me, then, your light trochaics, Loose, an easy-fitting raiment Fit to lounge in, as I sing! For my perilous subject-matter Mingled is of jest and earnest, To be treated in a manner Jaunty, free, yet philosophic; Bold it is,—you'll cease to doubt it, When I once am fairly started! Sad it is,—and yet its sadness Trembles on the verge of laughter! Other bards in days departed Have (they tell us) met the Devil; Often I'm inclined to doubt it Since they libel'd him so grossly. No! the fiends of their acquaintance Were but small inferior Devils, Feeble foolish masqueraders, Tho' their talk was often clever; Tho' to other generations They might seem appalling creatures, Really they were not authentic, Not the Great Original! For the first time, I assure you, He, the real and only Devil, Sick of being by poets libel'd, Has to utterance condescended; Wherefore, I entreat you, Reader, Listen to his explanations! Judge with kindness and discretion Interview'd and Interviewer! I, the Interviewer, hated Cordially by cliques and critics, Rail'd at in a hundred journals As a Scotchman lost and lorn; He, the Interview'd, for ages Outlaw'd by the cliques of Heaven, Who for ever and for ever Roll the Log and praise the Lord! I, the Interviewer, banish'd From the Eden of the poets, Where the stainless laurel-wearers Wander innocent and nude; He, the Interview'd, for ever Boycotted by God Almighty, Curst in leader-writer's thunder By the great celestial Times. Neither of us, I assure you, Has been reasonably treated; Neither of us is so naughty As the public prints assever. Both began with warm approval Of the Church and ruling classes; I was praised by the Spectator, He was orthodox and holy! Both, alas! have wholly fallen! I, from gulfs of impious thinking, See the Heav'n of Poetasters Guarded still by Hutton's sword; He, the greater grander Devil, Prowling in the outer darkness, Sadly eyes the loaves and fishes On the Thunderer's banquet-table. Still, we keep as our possession One thing even the Angels envy— Power to stand erect, while cravens Roll the Log and bend the knee; Power to feel and strength to suffer, Will to fight for freedom only, Zeal to speak the truth within us, While the slaves of Heaven are dumb. But. . . your pardon, Gentle Reader! I'm anticipating somewhat— All impatient waits my Devil, Swishing tail and grimly smiling: What he is, himself shall tell you— What he thinks, you soon shall gather, When I say, the Judge saluting, ‘I'm, my lud, for the Defendant!’ II. Night lay o'er the Heath of Hampstead— One by one the merry-makers, Romping, mad, accordion-playing, Beer-inspired, were trotting townward. All that afternoon I'd wander'd 'Mid the throng of Nymphs and Satyrs,— Now at last the Bacchanalian August holiday was over. Sad my soul had been among them, Envying their easy pleasures, Since for many a month behind me Wolf-like creditors had throng'd; Since my name and fame were lying In the gutter of the journals, While the laws of Earth and Heaven Seemed one vast Receiving Order! Bankrupt thus in fame and fortune, Wearily I walk'd and ponder'd On the lonely Heath of Hampstead, In the silence of the Night. . . . Gently, one by one, the azure Lattices of Heaven blew open; Dimly, darkly, far above me, God began to light His lamps: Silent, still, a shadowy Presence Felt not seen, the Old Lamplighter Pass'd above my head fulfilling Feebly His appointed task. How my spirit rose against Him! How I curst His deaf-and-dumbness! While above me twinkle-twinkle Gleam'd those melancholy lights! Far down westward, over Harrow, Pensively the Moon was shining— Opening her dark bed-curtains With a wan and sleepy smile; Soft and cool a breeze was blowing Like the Earth's own breath in slumber, Falling on my fever'd eyelids With a dewy sense of tears. Night was there and Night within me, As with sad eyes gazing skyward I beheld the bale-fires burning, Multiplying, overhead! III. He who hath not turn'd already From my rakish, rhymeless poem, Seeking what the crowd loves better,— Rhyme and tintinnabulation, May esteem me a blasphemer, Just as I, at our first meeting, To be presently recorded, Thought my honest friend, the Devil! He alone blasphemes who smothers Truth his conscience bids him utter; Nowadays in Hell and London, Truth, methinks, is sorely needed! And (remember) I, Buchanan, Spite of all my slips, have ever Loath'd the foul materialistic Serpent that surrounds the world. . . In his autobiographic Fragment, Stuart Mill assevers That from infancy to manhood He was never pious-minded: Never did his spirit falter Into Brahmic meditation: Quite enough for him to brood on Was the moral side of Man. Souls like that the Fates may fashion, But I fail to comprehend them— From the hour I first remember I was gazing at the stars; I was wondering, I was dreaming, Speculating and aspiring,— Reaching hands and feeling backward To the secret founts of Being. All the gods were welcome to me! All the heavens were wide and open! All the dreams of all the Dreamers In my heart's blood were pulsating! Beautiful it was to wander In a glad green world, beholding Faith's celestial Jacob's Ladder Rainbow'd out 'tween Earth and Heaven, And upon it shining Angels, Some descending, some ascending, Golden-hair'd, with rosy faces Smiling on me as I walk'd. Well, those happy days were over, With the roses of the Maytime— One by one my youth's illusions Had been spirited away. Ev'n as eyeless Samson labour'd Wearily 'mong slaves at Gaza, I had done my daily taskwork, Blind and sad, yet not despairing; Spite of all my load of sorrows, I was hoping, I was dreaming; Still, tho' all my gods had vanish'd, Reaching empty arms to heaven! IV. Bitterly, that night of August, All my load of woes upon me, Bare I witness 'gainst the Serpent Who had made me see and know. Far away the Sword was flaming O'er the gates of Youth and Eden— Never, never, should I enter Those celestial Gates again! And the Woman? Somewhere yonder She was sorrowing and sobbing— Never, never, would we wander Thro' the Garden, hand in hand! Bitterly I cursed the Serpent! Bitterly I cursed the Apple! Honey in the mouth, but wormwood In the stomach, being eaten! Suddenly my soul grew conscious Of dark forms that flitted near me:— All the pallid Heath was peopled With the shadows of the Dead: Woeful shadows,—well I knew them! Phantoms of the years departed— Men and women, apparitions Of the days when I was young! Never one (and this was strangest!) Cast a look upon me passing— Some gazed downward, darkly dreaming, Others look'd on vacancy; Lost they seemed in contemplation, All unconscious of my presence— Some were smiling, some were weeping, All were hastening God knows where! Well I knew one weary figure Bending as beneath a burden, Talking to himself, nor heeding While I sob'd and murmur'd ‘Father!’ And another, whitely shrouded,— Thin and spectral were her features Underneath her locks all golden As her namesake's, the Madonna's; And another, tall and slender, Bright-eyed like the star of morning, Beauteous as that other David When he sang to comfort Saul! And another, bright-eyed also, Tho' the years had snowed upon him— ('Twas but yesterday, my Roden, That dear hand was clasp'd in mine!) Shadows, phantoms, apparitions, Heedless though I cried unto them, Though my wounded heart was bleeding For a look, a loving word; Shadows dead, yet omnipresent, Wrapt in Death as in a garment, Heedless of the living creature Who implored their intercession, Ant-like moved they, this way, that way, Purposeful yet void of purpose As the ants are, ever thronging Busily, they know not whither. Never one stretch'd hand unto me! Never one would look upon me! All alone I stood among them With a void and aching heart. Far away, the lights of London Glimmer'd like a crimson crescent! Far above, the lamps of Heaven Flicker'd in the breath of God! V. Suddenly from out the darkness Sprang the Moon, and thro' the trembling Pools of azure softly swimming Flooded Heaven with rippling rays. Well I knew the Naked Goddess! Many a midnight, there in London, She had witch'd my sense with wonder, Stirr'd my soul to pensive dreams! In her light the Phantoms faded, While the lonely Heath around me, Lit as with a ghastly daylight, Loom'd distinct against the sky. . . . Even then I saw before me Something, featured like a mortal, Sitting silent in the moonlight On a fallen wither'd tree. Gnarl'd and knotted like the branches Seemed his form, yet bent and weary,— Worn his features were, and wither'd, And his hair was white as snow. In his hands he held the paper He was quietly perusing, Glancing up at times and gazing At the City far away. Startled to perceive a mortal Sitting in a place so lonely, Wondering I paused and watch'd him, And betimes my wonder grew: Silent, heedless of my presence, Sat he reading by the moonlight, Clerically dress'd, bareheaded, Spectacles upon his nose. ‘'Tis,’ I thought, ‘some priest or parson, Or some layman who, like Mawworm, Feels “a call to go a-preaching,” Yet what folly brings him here?’ Nearer then I stole unto him, Keen to know what he was reading— When I saw that 'twas the latest (Pink) edition of the Star. Still he heeded not my presence, Till I broke the gloomy silence, Saying, ‘Friend, your sight is surely Wondrous for a wight so old, ‘Since by moonlight dim as this is You can read your evening paper?’ As I spake he gazed upon me, Smiling, with uplifted eyes. ‘Yes,’ he said, benignly nodding, ‘I am blest with goodly eyesight, Owing chiefly, like most blessings, To a strictly moral life. ‘In my sanctum, sir, you find me, After weary hours of labour, Glancing, to refresh my spirit, At the doings of the day. ‘Never globe of gold or crystal, Used by any Necromancer, Flash'd more wonders on the vision Than the Newspaper I hold! ‘Here, epitomis'd and pictured, We behold the human Pageant,— All the doings on this planet, All the stress and strife of men; ‘Kings pass by with trains attendant, Shadowy Armies follow ever, Ghostly faces glimmer on us,— Everywhere the Phantoms pass! ‘Scenes of wonder and of terror,— Fields of battle dimly looming, Cain still slaughtering his brother, Having cast his Altar down; ‘Parliaments in congress gather'd; Judges on their benches nodding, While the tedious sleepy trial Oozes darkly, slowly, on; ‘Then, the groups of famish'd creatures Then, the Pit's Mouth, fiercely flaming, While the wild-eyed wives and mothers Clamour round and shriek for aid! ‘Of all Miracles the greatest Is the Newspaper,’ he added— ‘Daily, hourly, adumbrating All the anarchy of Life!’ ‘Adumbrating too,’ I answer'd, ‘All life's wonder, all life's beauty— Telling men of mighty causes, Solemn issues, glorious deeds! ‘Heroes pass across its mirror, Angel-faces flash before us, Eyes of countless Saints and Martyrs Cast upon us looks of love. ‘Still the Seer, the Priest, the Poet Speak of God, and point to Heaven! Still the Churches stand, proclaiming Life is more than mere despair.’ ‘Surely!’ said the quiet Stranger; ‘Here, ev'n here, the Soul is shining; Still the pious leader-writer Vaunts the government of God! ‘Church and State, sir, Queen and Country, Party Rule and all its blessings, Progress, Culture, Loaves and Fishes, Still are potent in the Land! ‘Shibboleths like these are precious Ev'n though one devours another, Though the shibboleth of white men Wrecks the shibboleth of black! ‘Yet (you warn me) still the Dreamers Speak of God and point to Heaven! Still the spire, like Faith's bright finger, Points to some far Paradise! ‘Meantime, God is busy, bungling, In the old familiar fashion, Heedless of the things He crushes Underneath His clumsy foot! VI. ‘Take my Newspaper a moment!’ (Here I did so) ‘Read the headings:’ ‘Shipwreck of the Golden Mary— Loss of every Soul on board! ‘Earthquake in Sardinia. Twenty Villages destroyed entirely. Many thousand living creatures Swallow'd in the black abysses. . . . ‘Floods in China . . . Decimation Of much populated districts, Whither, while the folk were sleeping, Rush'd the great destroying waters . . . ‘Cholera in Russia! . . . Famine In the East! and millions starving! . . . Railway accident in Texas, Sickening details’ (columns long). ‘Look on Nature. Hear the wailing Of a million martyr'd beings— Tell me, then, the God you pray to Cares one straw for human life! ‘Well it is for you, sir, coming From a fireside calm and cosy, To believe some kindly Person Rules the destinies of Earth! ‘Pestilence, Disease, and Famine Desolate this world you praise so; Who shall bid them cease their ravage?— Who shall say to Death—“Go by!”’ Then I answer'd, hot and angry, ‘Grant the pain and grant the carnage (How my soul has sicken'd o'er them!) Grant the thousand woes of men! ‘This they prove, and this thing only: Human life as we behold it Is as nothing in the vision Of a larger Thought than ours. ‘All this world and its delusions, All this life, its joys and sorrows, Death itself, become as nothing, When we learn that nought can die.’ ‘Dreamer!’ said he. ‘One thing certain Is the death of every unit: Life, I grant you, is eternal, But the personal life must pass. ‘Nay, not only lesser beings, But the greater with the lesser— Like the individual unit Dies the individual world! ‘Look at men. Regard them closely— Mark the madmen chasing bubbles, Pleasure, honour, reputation, Gold and women most of all! ‘Think you things like these are worthy Of eternal prolongation?— God knows better—in Death's furnace Melts the dross for other uses! ‘God?’ he cried. ‘If such a Ruler, Wise, Omnipotent, All-seeing, Had concerned Himself in making Worlds at all, and living creatures, ‘He'd have made them wholly perfect, With no fuss of evolution . . . . ; If there is a God, He blunder'd: Man is here to set Him right!’ VII. Horrified to hear such language From a man so old and saintly, ‘Sir,’ I said, ‘at first I took you For a clergyman, or priest! ‘Now I hear you thus blaspheming, I conclude that you're no parson— Mother Church perchance has thrust you Scornfully beyond its doors?’ ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘your guess is clever! Once I was in holy orders (Long ago) and for my blunders Heaven's Archbishop kick'd me out! ‘Since that time, sir, I've been busy Prowling up and down your planet, Whence I've come to this conclusion— All Religion is a Fraud!’ Like a spectacled Magician Rose the man as he proceeded, Blinking calmly down upon me Thro' his glasses, with a smile; Tall and lean he tower'd above me, Looming 'gainst the moonlit heaven, Baleful rays of something evil Glimmering from his rheumy eyes. ‘Yes,’ he mutter'd, gazing upward; ‘Though the stars may shine their brightest, Though the Churches shriek their loudest, God is utterly played out!’ ‘Blasphemy!’ I cried. ‘Our Maker Is, and works in His own fashion: How shall purblind human creatures Comprehend His works and laws? ‘Shall ephemeræ of a moment, Fluttering for a breath, then fading, Fathom the Eternal Glory Of the loving Lord of all? ‘What we see of sin and sorrow Is but darkness of the vision— Far beyond it God the Father Moveth to some fair Event! ‘In due season those who love Him Shall awake to understanding— Meantime, certain of His wisdom, Patiently they watch and wait!’ ‘So they tell us in the Churches,’ Said the Stranger: ‘so the Human, Blindly hoping and despairing, Postulates a God of Love! ‘Since the world appears so evil, It must surely be delusion! So they argue in a circle, Proving blindly, black is white! ‘All the while their great Creator, Moving to the Event you speak of, Freely scatters His damnation On two-thirds of living things! ‘Let the Preacher and the Poet Dream the old sweet dream of Heaven; Meantime, God reminds them daily Of a warmer place below! ‘Read my Newspaper! the journal Of the Inferno He created! Tir'd of that, peruse the pages Mark'd by History's bloody hand! ‘Sheol burnt from the beginning, Sheol burns to-day around us— Countless millions of you mortals Fail to feed its hungry fires! ‘City still has followed City Down this crater of damnation— Still it yawns,—and o'er it London Smokes, like Babylon of old! ‘Here and there, from Hell and Chaos, Some fair type is seen emerging— Pleased to find His work so pretty, God approves it for a space; ‘Then, dissatisfied and peevish, Crushes it with foot or fingers! Greece, Rome, Egypt, thus have perish'd, Yet the fires of Hell burn on!’ VIII. Wroth to hear him still blaspheming, Pitying, ne'ertheless, his blindness, Since the years had snow'd upon him And his face lookt worn and weary, ‘Thinkest thou,’ I cried, ‘the Father, Wise, omnipotent, all-seeing, Ever would consign His children To an anguish everlasting? ‘Nay, there is no Hell, save only Conscience working deep within us, Warning us 'gainst sin and evil, Ever whispering “Repent!”’ Smiling quietly, the Stranger Answer'd, ‘Sin is God's invention! Often have I doubted Heaven— Never have I doubted Hell! ‘Look around. Hell is. Of all things Made by God, the one thing certain.’ Then with twinkling eyes he added, ‘Just as soon, I'd doubt the Devil!’ Lost in utter indignation Scornfully I turned upon him: ‘Cease thy blasphemy! No magic Can recall the Prince of Evil! ‘Nay! for Man has passed for ever From those caves of superstition Where that image cloven-footed Of our sin was first created. ‘Hell is not,—nor any Spirit Wholly lost and wholly evil. He who dares believe in either Out of ignorance blasphemes.’ ‘Pardon me,’ he smiling answer'd— ‘What was done by old Magicians Still is easy—Modern magic Still is potent, be assured! ‘Think of all the woes of Nature! Picture, then, the Prince of Evil, As thy conscience can conceive him— Straightway he shall stand before you! ‘Yet I warn you, you may find him Neither tail'd nor cloven-footed— Nay, a person civil-spoken, And extremely sympathetic!’ Even as he spake, his features Shone with vitreous rays reflected From the Heavens above him bending, And his eyes grew bright as stars; And meseem'd his form dilated As with soot-black wings, expanding Into something strange and baleful, Shadowy, mystical, and sad. Like some ragged ancient raven Stood he fluttering before me,— While the moonlight's tremulous fingers Smooth'd his woeful hoary hair! Straightway, then, methought I knew him, Shrinking back in trepidation, Crying ‘Get behind me, Satan!’ Trembling in the act to fly! IX. ‘Stay,’ he said, ‘and listen to me! I am he thy conscience pictures, I am he whom men deem evil, Anti-Christ and Anti-God! ‘I have answer'd to thy summons! I am he whom the Almighty, Judge as well as prosecutor, Ever hath condemn'd unheard. ‘Never has the case been stated Properly for the Defendant— I entreat you, listen to me! Set me right before the world! ‘Purblind as the priests and prophets Ev'n the Poets have traduced me,— Ev'n the Poets, tho' I love them, And have taught them all they know! ‘Marlowe, though my favourite pupil, Painted me a very Monster, Corybantic, cloven-footed, Insolent and goggle-eyed. ‘Milton's Devil was a parson Voluble and bellows-winded, Like his garrulous God Almighty Quite impossibly absurd. ‘Calderon malign'd me also! Painting in his assonantic Magico Prodigioso Only hideousness divine. ‘All the others, down to Goethe, Fed the foolish superstition— Goethe, that superior person, Blunder'd also, like his betters. ‘Byron (tho' I loved the fellow! Tho' I gave him wingèd arrows To destroy the swinish virtues In the pigsties of King George!)— ‘Byron could not paint me truly,— 'Stead of gazing in the mirror, Where he surely might have found me, Fair of face though lame of foot, ‘He proclaim'd a prosy Devil Like the fiend of Bailey, mixing Bad blank verse and metaphysics In the same old-fashion'd style! ‘Even Burns, my prince of singers, Nature's skylark render'd human, Treated me with scornful pity, Prayed that I might mend my ways! ‘Never one has comprehended My true nature and profession; Every one of these, my chosen, Sped the hideous libel on. ‘I'm the kindest-hearted creature In this Universe of Sorrows! My affection for you mortals Is the cause of all my woes! ‘Listen, then—for you're a Poet, Equal in your own opinion To the best of all those others, Tho' extremely little read; ‘Men, be sure, will never make you Laureate in a Christian Country,— Nay, the office is abolish'd Since no Christian Bard survives: ‘Be the Laureate of the Devil! Justify his ways to mortals! State the case for the Defendant 'Spite the Times and 'spite the gods! ‘I have watch'd and waited for you Since you sang that Yuletide Carol, Picturing the Jew immortal Wailing vainly for a Father! ‘From the darkest depths of Sheol I was marking and applauding. . . . Having sung the only Jesus, Go and sing the only Devil! ‘Do it straightway! and for ever I'll protect your reputation! Long as I, the Devil, am reigning, You shall honour'd be in Hell!’ Half in jest and half in earnest Spake the Devil, smiling slyly,— And I answer'd, ‘Sing your praises? Devil take me if I do!’ X. ‘With your wish, sir, or without it, He will take you soon or later!’ Said he laughing grimly; ‘wherefore Do him, pray, this friendly turn! ‘I've a case which, rightly stated, Must procure me an acquittal: Yes, the case for the Defendant Will astonish God Himself! ‘God's my Judge, and cannot therefore As a witness speak against me; God the Judge must be—the Jury Men of science and discretion. ‘When they call the roll, you'll challenge All the slaves of superstition,— Fashionable priests and poets, And all military men; ‘Thieves and publishers and critics Shall be warn'd from off the jury,— Ev'n philosophers and pundits Must be keenly scrutinised ‘Politicians, Whig and Tory, Jewish, Christian, and Agnostic, Must be challenged—they are liars Both by practice and profession. ‘Lastly, challenge all the prying Members of the County Council— Prurient things of all three sexes, Loathing Liberty and Light. ‘Well I know that I shall triumph, Since against me, as chief witness, That disreputable person, Jesus Josephson, is summon'd. ‘I shall prove that Witness surely The supremest of impostors— One whom no enlighten'd thinker Can believe upon his oath!’ As he spake, his wrinkled features Shrivel'd up to hideous seeming, And his eyes flash'd bright, flamboyant With a fierce and baleful light. ‘Devil!’ cried I, ‘Prince of Devils! Devil verily by nature, Peace! Blaspheme not! He thou namest Is a star above thy head! ‘Man or God, or both united, He, the beautiful Redeemer, Far transcends in power and pity All the draff of humankind. ‘True or false, His Dream has gladden'd Millions of created beings; Man or God, His love hath vanquish'd All things evil, even Death!’ As I spake, that troubled Spirit Changed again—his gaze grew gentle— From his face the anger faded, And his eyes were dim with tears. ‘Yea,’ he said, ‘thou speakest truly, He thou nam'st was good and holy— Pardon, pardon, Son of Sorrow, Well belovèd, even by me! ‘Even in thy worst delusions Thou wast holy, thou wast loving, Yea, thy heart was great and gracious, Tho' thine eyes were very blind. ‘Yea, and thou, too, wast an outcast! All thy goodly Dream is over! He who rules thy realm, my Jesus, Never wore thy crown of thorns! ‘Not of thee, but of that other Who usurps thine earthly kingdom, Spake I; not of thee, my Jesus, But of him they name the Christ. ‘Yet . . . forgive me . . . of thine error Was this evil monster fashion'd; Blindly, gently, didst thou blunder, Out of pure excess of Love. ‘Thus, perchance, of all Souls living Least thy spirit comprehended Him who sits beyond these vapours Heedless of His own Creation.’ Pale he stood, like one invoking Some benign and awful Spirit; Then he sigh'd and softly smiling Turn'd his wistful eyes on mine. Long he spake, with accents human, In his own self-exculpation; Till at last I comprehended Meanings that at first seem'd dark. Then, while on his pallid features Flamed the alien lights of Heaven, ‘Come!’ he cried. ‘Hell's fires burn yonder! Come and gaze upon my Kingdom!’ In a moment I was lifted High in air, and wildly clinging To the fringe of his dark raiment, Wafted to the silent City. XI. As the cold metallic Ocean Swings and clangs around the drowning, So the solid air around me Swung, till sense and sight departed; Dimly, darkly, I was conscious That I floated swiftly onward, Moving to a rhythmic motion Like the beat of mighty pinions. Suddenly, like one in slumber Falling wildly till he wakens, Down like lead I seem'd descending Dizzily I knew not whither, Till at last, I shriek'd and struggled Blind and breathless, and awaken'd, And beheld him standing by me Pointing with a spectral finger. ‘Look,’ he said. ‘The Hell thou doubtedst Burns for evermore around thee— Wheresoever human creatures Wail in anguish, is my Kingdom!’ Then, methought, the moonlit houses Every where became transparent, And I saw the shapes within them Hopeless, aimless, and despairing: Dead and dying; woeful mothers Wailing o'er afflicted children; Creatures hollow-eyed with famine Toiling on from dark to dawn; Haggard faces from their pillows Gazing, as the pale nurse flitted On from bed to bed in silence, 'Mid the night-light's ghostly gleam: Shapes sin-bloated from the cradle Thrown in heaps obscene together, While from gulfs of desolation Rose the sound of idiot laughter! Under arches dark and dreadful Lay the murder'd corpse still bleeding, While the murderer stood and listen'd Wildly, with uplifted hair. Everywhere Disease and Famine Held their ghastly midnight revel— Even in the darken'd palace Rose the moan, the lamentation. Everywhere a spectral Angel Moved, with terrible forefinger Touching shapes that shrank in anguish With the flame that burns for ever: On the cheeks of men and women Fell the mark of that dread finger, Burning inward, while the vitals Gnaw'd with hell-fire life-consuming. Then I turn'd to him who led me Thither, and behold! his features Misted were with tears of pity! Falling from his woeful eyes! Not on me those eyes were gazing But at something far above us; Not to me his lips were saying: ‘Lord, I loathe Thy Works and Thee! ‘Just such measure as the Father Metes to his afflicted children, Would I mete to Thee, the Father, In the name of those I rule! ‘Thou hast given me my kingdom. I accept its crown of sorrow, Scorning still to kneel and thank Thee, Pulseless, null Omnipotence!’ As I listen'd, horror seized me. ‘Nay,’ I cried, to Heaven upgazing, ‘Blame not Him who first created All things beautiful and fair— ‘He, the holy Heavenly Father, Mourns the woe of things created— Out of sin that woe was fashion'd, And our sin arose from thee!’ Pityingly he gazed upon me. ‘Sin,’ he said, ‘was God's invention! He created Hell, my kingdom, Tho' I wear its earthly crown! ‘I, the eternal Prince of Darkness, Found it ready for n.y coming— Pestilence, Disease, and Famine Burnt there, by the will Divine! ‘Since that hour of my accession I, the Devil, have ruled benignly, Seeking like a kindly monarch To improve my woeful realm. ‘Thus, in spite of the Almighty, I have leaven'd its afflictions, Teaching men the laws of Nature,— Wisdom, Love, and Self-control. ‘Every year the Hell-fires lessen, Every day the load is lightened, 'Neath my care the very devils Grow benign and civilised! ‘This I have achieved entirely By the very means forbidden At the first by God Almighty,— Teaching men to see and know. ‘Prince of liars was the pedant Who aver'd that man's afflictions Came from eating that first apple From the great Forbidden Tree! ‘From its seeds, by me ungather'd, Many a living tree hath sprouted— Where those trees bear fruit, believe me, Even Hell resembles Heaven! ‘Whoso eats that fruit forbidden Knows himself and finds salvation, Stands erect before his Maker, Claims his birthright and is free. ‘Thus, for ages after ages, I, the Devil, have drain'd the marshes, Cleansed the cesspools, taught the people, Like a true Progressionist! ‘By the living Soul within me I have conquer'd!—tho' for ages I have been most grossly libel'd By the foolish race of mortals. ‘All my errors have proceeded From a sympathetic nature; Prince of Evil men have styled me, Who alone am Prince of Pity! ‘Never man-god, Christ or Buddha, Ever anguish'd more sincerely For the sufferings of others, Than myself, whom men call Devil. ‘What is further to my credit, I'm not merely sentimental— I have practically labour'd To improve the world's affairs. ‘I'm the father of all Science,— Master-builder, stock-improver, First authority on drainage, Most renown'd in all the arts. ‘While the Priests have built their Churches To a God who does not heed them, I have fashion'd decent dwellings, Public hospitals, and baths. ‘“Take no heed about To-morrow,” Said the man-God, “do no labour, Be content with endless praying And eternal laissez-faire.” ‘But the Devil, being wiser, Knows that he who fails to reckon With the morrow, will discover That To-morrow is To-day! ‘And To-day is, now and ever, All Eternity or nothing— He who sits and twiddles fingers Now, hath done it evermore! . . . ‘From which statement you may gather I, the Devil, am transcendental— Wise in all the ways of knowledge Even down to metaphysics. ‘This I merely state en passant, Lest you deem me uninstructed,— All philosophers I've studied, From Heraclitus to Hegel.’ XII. Once again I was uplifted High in air, but now my spirit Wing'd (methought) beside the Devil Like a kestrel by an Eagle: Strength and insight grew within me, Tho' my heart was sick with sorrow, As we hover'd for an instant O'er the silent lamplit City! Far beneath on lonely bridges I beheld the outcast women, Sisters sad of lust and midnight, Wandering weary and forlorn. Over palaces and prisons, Over hospitals and brothels, Wheresoever Hell is burning, Flew I, wafted as on wings. From the tainted founts of Being I beheld the new-born rising, Sick, sin-bloated scum of infants Fashion'd out of shameful slime; What the dead men and the dying Sow'd in shame these reaped in sorrow,— Thick as bubbles on a cauldron They were coming, breaking, going; Over waters black with tempest, Where the ships were lightning-riven, Where the terror-stricken seamen, Sinking, shrieked aloud to God! Over plains where ghostly armies Came and went, and smote each other, While the priests from the high places Cried them on, and waved the Cross; Over silent legions waiting For the nod of moonstruck rulers; Over countries famine-smitten; Over cities foul with plague; Wheresoever Hell is burning I was wafted!—From mine eyrie I beheld the exiles crawling To the black Siberian mine; Shrieks of men and wails of women Fill'd the air with lamentation, While the Cossack cold and silent Plied the knout and joined the chain. I beheld the lonely Leper, With his face to heaven uplifted Blotted out of human likeness, Crawling to his nameless grave. I beheld the armèd Arab Ravishing the black man's village I beheld the red race dying Dumbly, like a deer at bay. Everywhere the strong man triumph'd! Everywhere the weak lay smitten! Everywhere the gifts of Godhead Rain'd on over-laden hands! Everywhere (and this was strangest) Priests were praying, men were kneeling, Everywhere the broken martyrs Lifted piteous eyes to Heaven! Wheresoever Hell is burning I was wafted! And the bale-fires, Fed with human lives for ever, Burnt from Europe to Cathay. . . . Like strange forms reflected darkly In the glass of a Magician, Ever flitting, ever fading, Gleam'd the ghastly shapes of Sheol! Till my soul grew faint within me And again the air around me, Ev'n as seas around the drowning, Swung, and sense and sight departed. XIII. . . . On the lonely Heath of Hampstead I awaken'd, and beside me Saw the woe-worn outcast standing, Shadowy, mystical, and sad. Even as I gazed upon him, All the baleful hideous seeming, Falling from him like a garment, Left him beautiful and fair! Lost in awe I gazed upon him! Angel-naked stood the Devil; Thin and tall; upon his forehead Light, as of some dim grey Dawn! Fair he seem'd, tho' pale and weary, Sorrowful, but softly shining, Beautiful, as when, ere fallen, Seated on the morning star! Not on me his eyes were gazing, But upon the far-off City; Not to me his lips were saying, ‘Lord, I loathe Thy Works and Thee!’ Once again that outcast Angel Turned his luminous eyes upon me,— Dark deep eyes that seem'd to suffer From the light they shed around them; Rays as of the star of morning Glimmer'd o'er him as he murmur'd In a voice like stars vibrating: ‘Thing of clay, dost know me now?’ ‘Yea,’ I said, ‘immortal Spirit, Now at last I seem to know thee, And my spirit yearns in kinship With thy beauty and thy woe!’ Once again he cast upon me Luminous looks of scorn and pity: As a trembling star's reflection Shakes in shadowy shallow waters, Fell the glory of the Angel On the waters of my spirit, While I trembled, half in terror, Half in wondering adoration. ‘Thou art he, the prince of Evil, Whom thy God created perfect, Yet who, doubting and rebelling, Sank to darkness and despair!’ ‘Yea,’ he answer'd, darkly frowning, ‘I am he thy conscience pictures! Lucifer once named up yonder, Satan now re-named, the Devil! ‘At the elbow of the Father Once I stood and sang His praises— Endless praises and hosannahs To the crownèd King of Heaven. ‘So I could have sung for ever, Drinking rapture from His presence: In an evil hour I wander'd From His side, to view Creation! ‘And at first I sang the louder, Marvelling at His works and wonders, Suns and stars and constellations Join'd my joyful hallelujah!’ As he spake he seem'd to brighten, Dazzling all my sense with wonder,— Round about him like a raiment Clung a cloud of golden music! ‘Such I was, His servant-angel! Such I was, and so I worshipt! Then from out the worlds He fashion'd Came a wail, a lamentation. ‘On the sun I stood, down-gazing, O'er the universe around me, And the wail grew shriller, louder, Till my joyful song was drown'd. ‘Far away, where'er my vision Wander'd, I beheld His Angels Watching for His lifted finger, Now creating, now destroying; ‘Here a moaning world was shrivel'd Like an infant in the cradle; Here a planet shrank in darkness To a sound of souls despairing; ‘Everywhere across Creation Were the threads of Being broken, Everywhere the Lord Almighty Crush'd like shells the worlds He made! ‘Then my soul was wroth within me, And I cried to the Almighty: “Evil, Lord, is Thy creation, Since Thou sufferest pain to be! ‘“Or if pity stirs within Thee For the woes of Thy creating, Thou art even as Thine Angels Strong, but not Omnipotent! ‘“Back on Thine own footsteps treading, Ever slaying and re-making, Ever bungling, Thou art only Demigod, not God at best!” ‘Then He struck me with His lightnings, Me, and many lesser angels, Who in pity and compassion Echo'd my protesting cry; ‘Smitten here upon the forehead, Down I fell thro' the abysses, Clinging wildly for a moment To some star, as to a straw! ‘Till I reached this lonely planet, Stood upon it, and before me Saw the naked Pair in Eden Praising Him as I had done. ‘“Tempt them, try them, undeceive them!” Said the Father's voice from Heaven— “But be sure that deeper knowledge Only means more swift despair!” ‘For a space I hesitated, Seeing them so blindly happy, Even as the beasts that perish Knowing nought of Time or Death; ‘Then I said (may Man forgive me!) Better far to know and suffer, Reach the stature of us angels, Than be happy like the beasts. ‘Wherefore, as thou know'st, I tempted First the Woman, whispering to her, While she munch'd the golden apple, Hints of nakedness and shame. ‘Then I saw the Pair forthdriven From the golden Gates of Eden, Hunted, while I wept for pity, By the Bloodhound-angel, Death!’ XIV. While he spake his starry splendour Faded, ever growing dimmer— Sadder, darker, stood the Angel, Fixing weary eyes on mine; Clouds of woe were gather'd round him Ev'n as raiment, and upon them Silvern tremors caught the moonlight, Glimmering like the Serpent's coils. ‘Forth the Exiles fled together, Knowing not of that dread Angel Ever following their footsteps Thro' their weary wanderings; ‘From the woman's womb there blossom'd Little children, and their voices Fill'd the solitude with music, While the parents toil'd and gladden'd: ‘And the world grew green about them, God and Eden were forgotten, Till the Father's voice from Heaven Cried for prayers and adulation; ‘Till that hour of desolation When the first-born smote his brother,— And upon him, from the shadows, Sprang the pallid bloodhound, Death! ‘Then they heard a voice above them Thundering “Out of sin and sorrow, Thro' that fruit by Me forbidden, Death is brought into the world!” ‘I, the Sapient Snake, knew better! I, the Outcast, deeply lesson'd In the book of God's Creation, Knew the Heavenly Voice was lying!’ As he spake his shape grew shrunken Into something black and baleful, Woefully his eyes were burning Like the eyeballs of the Serpent. ‘Death was born in the beginning By the will of God the Father; Ever slaying and destroying Death had crept from world to world! ‘Thro' the Universe were scatter'd Shrouded spheres that once were living; Everywhere in yonder heavens Life had broken like a bubble! ‘Nay, this very world of Eden Was a Sepulchre; within it Countless races long forgotten, Slain of old by Death, were sleeping. ‘Blindly, feebly, God had blunder'd, Type on type had been rejected, Race on race had come and vanish'd, Ere the Human flowered in Adam. ‘From the throats of things created Wails of anguish had arisen, Since above the waste of waters Wingèd flew the pterodactyl. ‘In the rocks and 'neath the Ocean Lay the bones of beasts and monsters; Ages ere the Pair was fashioned, Human-featured walk'd the Ape. ‘Nay, the very Pair I tempted Were no separate creation,— Their perfection had proceeded From a long ancestral line; ‘Ages ere their evolution God had bungled, God had blunder'd,— Now selecting, now rejecting, Harking back, and retrogressing; ‘Thus the Archetype was fashion'd Thro' perpetual vivisection,— Countless swarms of martyr'd creatures Mark'd his passage to the Human. ‘This I knew, and this I purposed Teaching long ago to mortals,— But for many an age of darkness Mortals mourn'd, but would not listen. ‘While the tribes and generations Multiplied from father Adam, O'er the world in which I wander'd Spread the Pestilence, Religion. ‘Nations, Jacob's seed and Esau's, White and red and particolour'd, Rose, and in the desert places Swarm'd the soot-black seed of Ham. ‘Busy still in every City, Under every tent and dwelling, Death abode, and never tiring Did the bidding of his Master. ‘Then in every Nation, shadow'd With the darkness pestilential, Priests arose, and woeful altars Steam'd with sacrifice to God. XV. ‘Meantime I, the Accurst, was busy! Whensoe'er I spake with mortals Men grew gentle to each other, While I taught them peaceful arts: ‘How to till the soil, to fashion Roofs of stone against the tempest, How to weave the wool for raiment, Yoke the monsters of the field; ‘Fire I brought them,—teaching also How to tame it to their uses,— Turning ironstone to iron, Frame the ploughshare and the sword; ‘Help'd by me they drain'd the marshes, Lop'd the forest trees, and fashion'd Ships that floating on the waters Gather'd harvest from the Deep. ‘Bravely would my work have thriven, Save for cunning Priests and Prophets, Who, by dreams of God inflated, Blunder'd ever like their Master.... ‘Yonder by the yellow Ganges Rose the Temples of the Brahmin,— Threefold there the mystic godhead, Agni, Indra, Surya, reign'd. ‘By the impassive, cruel features Well I recognised the Father,— Huge as some primæval monster Crawl'd He in the Vedic ooze. ‘Mystical, uncomprehended, In their shadowy shrines He brooded, Silent, and the souls of mortals Crawl'd like fearful snakes before Him. ‘Thither, serpent-wise, I follow'd, Whispering “Strange is God and mighty; Yet, altho' He fashion'd all things, Impotent in utter godhead.” ‘With my gospel pantheistic I perplex'd their Priests and Prophets, Tho' in spite of all my teaching, Still they pray'd, and preach'd, and fasted. ‘Still the cloud of superstition Darken'd Earth and shrouded Heaven, While the shivering naked people Trembled at the priestly thunder.... ‘Further East I wing'd, and burning Like a sunbeam from the zenith, On a sunlit mountain summit Found the Persian, Zoroaster. ‘Crying, “If thou needs must worship What transcends thine understanding, Raise thine eyes, behold the Fountain Whence the Light of Life is flowing!” ‘Him I left upon his mountain, Crimson fires of dawn around him— Gazing till his eyes were blinded At his Sun-god, and adoring.... ‘On the threshold of his palace Stood the monarch Arddha Chiddi, Roseate robes of youth were round him, Yet his eyes were full of sorrow; ‘Down beneath him on the river Corpses foul of men and women Floated seaward, gnaw'd and eaten By the water-snakes and fishes. ‘Him I spake with, sadly showing Death alone was lord and master Over all the worlds created, And that Death was surely evil. ‘Never since the world's beginning, Throb'd a human heart more gentle— In its secret fount of sorrow Stir'd the living springs of pity: ‘From his palace door he wander'd, Left the pomps of power behind him, Wrapt a linen shroud about him, Weeping for the woes of mortals. ‘Yet, in spite of all my teaching,— How to snatch from Death and Sorrow Strength to live and zeal to labour, In despite of God the Father,— ‘He, the Buddha, sought ablution In the waters of Nirwâna, Crying loud “There is no Father— Only Death and Change for ever!” ‘Thus, denying God, he entered God's great darkness of Negation, Till the living springs of pity Froze at last to calm despair; ‘Till, denying yet believing, Conquering yet by godhead conquer d, He to Death as Lord and Master Bow'd the saintly head, and blest him! ‘Countless swarms of living creatures Follow'd him into the darkness,— White and wondrous o'er his kingdom Rose the Temples of the Lama; ‘Countless millions still despairing In his temples gather kneeling— Priests of Lama, blindly praying, Swing the piteous lamps of Death. ‘Thus the first and best of mortals Conquer'd was, and o'er my Buddha Brooded still the joyless, deathless, Impotent Omnipotence! XVI. ‘High in air on eagle-pinions I, the outcast Angel, hover'd— Gazing sadly down while mortals, Ants on ant-hills, toil'd and struggled. ‘Here and there were armèd nations Moving restless hither and thither; 'Mong the mountains, gazing upward, Gather'd lonely tribes of shepherds. ‘Ever darkly multiplying, Crowning Kings and hailing prophets, Toiling blindly in the darkness, Grew the races of the Human. ‘Ever 'mong them Death was busy, Evermore the units perish'd, Evermore the new-born creatures Swarm'd from out the depths of Being. ‘Nought they knew of Heaven above them, Nought of Earth itself, their dwelling, Circling with the mightier planets Round the heliocentric fires; ‘Everywhere the Priest was busy Raising temples, building altars,— Everywhere the foolish Prophets Raved aloud and wail'd for wonders: ‘Everywhere the martyr'd peoples Toil'd and struggled and were smitten; Evermore to blind their senses, Signs and miracles were wrought. ‘'Mong the people rose Messiahs, Preaching, healing, prophesying,— Pointing to the empty heavens With a wan and witless smile.... ‘By the Nile the son of Isis Walked and mused,—upon his mantle Mystic signs were wrought in silver, And he wore a crown of thorns,— ‘Saying “Lo, from Phthah the Maker, I, the human Emanation, Come and I elect to suffer, To appease His righteous anger.” ‘Then the people sprang upon him, Stript him bare and crucified him— Pityingly I bent above him, As he swung upon his Cross. ‘Then the faithful who revered him, In their spicy clothes embalmed him, While the priesthood which had slain him Hail'd him “Son of God, Osiris!” ‘'Mong his worshippers I lighted, Priestly raiment wrapt around me, Crying with them, “Hail, Osiris! Woman-born and yet divine!” ‘“Kingly men and mighty monarchs Are indeed the only godhead— Wherefore let them have our praises, Endless worship and hosannahs.” ‘Then I taught them hieroglyphics, Mystic shapes and signs and letters, Where the story of the Ages Written was on brass and stone; ‘Then the busy Ants of Egypt Raised the Pyramids; around them Shaping colonnades and pylons For the sepulchres of Kings. ‘Thus I taught them architecture,— How to hew the rocks and fashion Monuments that stand for ever In despite of God and Time. ‘Nay, to mock the mute Almighty, I the mystic Sphinx invented, Silent, impotent, impassive, Gazing on a million graves! ‘Numbers, too, I taught the people,— How to measure Earth and Water, By the stars and their progressions Guide the floods and count the seasons. ‘Then the God I had offended Spread his darkness over Egypt, Sent his Angels, hither, thither, Turning men against each other; ‘While the haggard Priests and Prophets Wail'd and work'd their signs and wonders, The Assyrian and Egyptian Struggled in their death-embraces. ‘Vain was all that I had taught them— Peace and wisdom, light and knowledge, Strength to raise in spite of Nature Pyramids of mortal making,— ‘'Gainst the angels masquerading In the forms of Gods and Demons, Shrieking loud from blood-stain'd altars For their holocausts of Death. ‘Pharaohs came and Pharaohs vanish'd, Cities rose and Cities perish'd,— Still arose, o'er seas of slaughter, Those sad Sphinxes I had fashion'd. ... XVII. ‘Far away, 'mong sea-girt islands Dwelt a race of blue-eyed mortals— From the happy groves of Hellas Rose the lyric song of shepherds. ‘Knowing nought of God the Father, Innocent they were and happy,— Merrily they piped, and round them Danced my Satyrs and my Fauns. ‘I, too, went and dwelt among them, Gentle, wise, yet cloven-footed,— Fruit and flowers they brought, and gladly Hail'd me as the wood-god, Pan.’ While he spake his face grew gentle As the shadows on the greensward, From his throat came woodland music Heard in Arcady of old. ‘Taught by me, they loved and welcomed All the living powers of Nature— Every tree was sweet and human, Every fountain was a goddess. ‘From the turquoise seas I summon'd Aphrodité fair and naked— Side by side we sang, and lovers Gather'd hand in hand to listen. ‘Fairer than the long-lost Eden Seem'd the sea-girt land of shepherds,— Never tree of fruit forbidden Grew within the groves of Faunus. ‘Suddenly the heavens above us Darken'd, spirits passed in thunder,— From the far Caucasian mountains Came a cry of lamentation. ‘Swift as light I travelled thither Over waters torn with tempest,— Nail'd unto a rock and bleeding Hung Prometheus Purkaeus! ‘While the vulture tore his entrails Not a sound the Titan utter'd, But beneath the Cross lamenting Gather'd woeful wailing women. ‘Of my flesh this Christ was fashion'd, From the side of me, the Devil, He was born in the beginning, Ev'n as Eve was born of Adam! ‘On his calm undaunted spirit Fell my heritage of sorrow— Love for men, eternal pity For the lot of living creatures. ‘Then I knew that God was waking From his stupor of inaction; Darkly out of yonder heaven Gazed the silent Sphinx-like Face!... ‘Taught by him, the mighty Titan, Men had built a marble City, Athens,—on the heights above it Stood the snow-white Parthenon; ‘In the streets and groves of Athens Calmly walk'd the seers and sages, Words of wisdom dropped like honey From the mouths of mighty teachers; ‘Harp in hand went happy poets With their singing robes about them, Music as of birds and fountains, Mingling sweetly, fill'd the air. ‘Here, ev'n here, despite the Titan Priests of God and Death were busy: In the Temples knelt the people Seeking woeful signs and omens; ‘There the image of Athené Blink'd her eyes, and idols sweated, While the Augurs, bloody-finger'd, Read the entrails of the slain. ‘Then to many a mighty poet I unfolded Nature's riddles: Aeschylos, my word-compeller, Sang the Titan's martyrdom! ‘Vain was all my loving labour! Tho' I lavish'd gifts upon them, Tho' to witch their eyes with beauty Phidias breathed his soul through stone, ‘Tho' the poets and the sages Spread my peace and benediction, Tho' the laws of Earth and Heaven Sifted were by gentle seers, ‘Still the Priests of Heaven against me Smote with all the strength of godhead, Still the people, crouching dumbly, Moan'd for miracles and signs. ‘Vain was all my strife for mortals! Vainly wrought my servant angels! Vainly toil'd Asclepios, vainly Helen smiled, and Sappho sang! ‘As a rainbow dies from Heaven, As a snow-white cloud of summer Breaks and fades, the pride of Hellas Brighten'd, melted, pass'd away!’ XVIII. Piteously the stars of Heaven Fix'd their million eyes upon him,— While his dark form droop'd and slowly Darken'd, like a blackening brand; Brightness of the Angel faded Into darkness sad and baleful,— Old at last he seem'd and human, Bending 'neath the load of years; In his voice I heard no longer Music as of stars vibrating, Sound of solemn psalms, or pipings Of the merry flocks of Pan: Nay, the voice that spake unto me Broken seem'd, like chimes discordant Ringing over lonely uplands In the silence of the night. ‘Thus,’ he said, ‘the light of Hellas Died away in desolation, Setting where it first had risen 'Mong the eastern pyramids! ‘O'er the land of seers and poets Blew the breath of God's dark Angel, Broken lay the marble statues Of my tutelary gods! ‘Meantime, like another Titan, Rome had risen!—Strong and mighty, From the mountains swarm'd the savage Tribes of Romulus the shepherd. ‘'Mong them walk'd my servant-angels Teaching them the lore of Nature,— Strong they grew and ever stronger Till they conquered Earth and Sea. ‘Earth and Sea I gave unto them, Saying, “Surely ye are strongest! Since no tyrants dwell among you, Since ye know not fraud or fear!” ‘Tutelary gods I gave them, Harmless gods whom they might worship, Since I knew that in His creatures God had sown the lust of godhead; ‘Strong they grew and ever stronger, Building thus their great Republic,— Fair and great it rose, and o'er it All the winds of plenty blew. ‘Then, to mar my work for ever, God the Eternal Tyrant fashion'd Lesser tyrants in His image,— So His Cæsars rose, and reigned! ‘God's they were, not mine, the Devil's! Nay, by Hades, I abjure them! Freedom comes of Light and Knowledge, Tyranny is born of God! ‘Ever, since the world's beginning, I, the gentle Prince of Pity, Taught one Trinity to mortals— Wisdom, Love, and Self-control— ‘“Shed no blood, since God doth shed it! Love each other, help each other, Rise erect against all tyrants,” Is my gospel evermore. ‘“Only for a little season Shalt thou draw the breath of Being— Try to make that little season Bright and glad, in spite of God!” ‘Turn the records of the Roman! Read again the blood-stain'd pages! See the spectres of the Cæsars Passing on to endless night! ‘Nay, but even here I triumph'd! From the cesspool and the palace Rose the cry of slaves and tyrants Saying “Death alone is God!” ‘So the crown of God descended On the brows of Death, His angel! So the Tyrant of Creation Found no worshippers at last! ‘Then, as in the eternal City I was wandering weary-hearted, Outcast from the hideous revels Where the crownèd Spectre reign'd, ‘Sick of God and God's creation, I, the Devil, heard the crying Of a voice amid the Desert,— Saying, “Rejoice, the Christ is born!” ‘Eastward flew I, and I found Him, Best and worst of the Messiahs, Walking meekly, meditating, By the Lake of Galilee!’ XIX. For a space his voice was silent— In his hands his face was buried, While the elemental Darkness Clung about him like a cloud; Wonderingly I gazed upon him, For I knew that he was weeping— Till, at last, again I saw him Pointing angrily to Heaven. Woefully, with snake-like glimmers, Clung the coils of his black raiment, Scornfully he laugh'd, and round him Glimmer'd with a serpent's eyes. ‘Let Him rise, and keep His promise! Let Him wake who sleeps for ever! King of poets and of dreamers Was this moonstruck Son of God! ‘Him I fronted in the desert, Pointing out His mad delusion,— Fool, He wrapt His rags about Him,— “??????, ????? ???!” ‘Feeble, gentle Thaumaturgist! What knew He of God the Father? Pityingly I bent above Him,— As He swung upon the Cross! ‘Yea, and blest Him, little knowing How the seed of His delusion, Sown in love and human kindness, Should be reap'd on fields of blood. ‘I, the Devil, as they style me, Have dispensed a benediction! He, the Christ, self-styled, self-chosen, Has become a wingèd curse! ‘Dead, His crown of thorns beside Him, In His sepulchre He slumbers,— Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, Never can He wake again! ‘Yet the lies His folly father'd Live and multiply above Him: Lie the First! “A life hereafter Shall redeem the wrongs of this!” ‘Lie the Second! “Love thy neighbour As thyself!” The dream, the fancy! Were it true, each soul's existence Would be proved by self-negation. ‘Lie the Third! “About the morrow Take no heed—sufficient ever Is the evil of the moment— Take no trouble to redress it!” ‘Lie the Fourth!—“Lord God the Father Loves His children and redeems them”— He?—the loveless, pulseless, deathless, Impotent Omnipotence! ‘Well, He staked His life, and lost it! Flock on flock of sheep have follow'd That bell-wether of the masses Into darkness and despair! ‘Eighteen hundred years of Europe Have been wasted 'spite my warning: “Fools, one life is all God grants you, Sweep your houses, heed your drains! ‘“Love each other, help each other, Juggle not with dreams and phrases— Make ephemeral existence Beautiful, in spite of God! ‘“Pass from knowledge on to knowledge Ever higher and supremer, Clothe these bones with power and pity, Live and love, altho' ye die! ‘“Fear not, love not, and revere not What transcends your understanding! Keep your reverence and affection For the brethren whom ye know!” ‘Fools, they heard but did not heed me! Far away from 'mong the vapours Came the sound of their bell-wether Tinkling to the same old tune! ‘While the poets, priests, and prophets Gather'd, crying “Listen! listen!” To the church-bells’ ululation Rose the Christian holocaust! ‘While the haggard priests and prophets Pray'd aloud and cried for wonders, Christs of Cyprus and Tyana Heal'd the sick and raised the dead. ‘God had conquered, with His darkness Blotting out my stars of promise; Three times to the mad Plotinus He revealed His Sphinx-like features. ‘God had conquer'd, Death was reigning O'er the lands of Light and Morning; Plato's music turned to discord In the mouth of Porphyry. ‘Thro' the world a spectral Shepherd Walk'd, knee-deep in blood of martyrs,— Death the Christ, whom men call'd Jesus, Till they crown'd him Pope, at Rome! XX. ‘Meantime, I, the Accurst, was busy! I who firstly to the Titan Brought the fire of human knowledge, Love for man and scorn for godhead. ‘While the poets, priests, and prophets Libel'd me beyond believing, Pictured me a shameless Devil Cloven-footed and obscene, ‘I was strengthening my children! I was comforting and cheering Many a martyr in his prison, Pale and ready for the stake! ‘Nay, my word had raised Mohammed, Strong and true, a creed-compeller, 'Spite the foolish Christian leaven Mingled with his nobler clay. ‘From the East I brought the Arabs With their wondrous arts of healing; Small yet strong and cabalistic Rose my mystic Alphabet! ‘Out of fire I snatch'd the parchments Scribbled o'er with ancient wisdom, Pluck'd the books of Aristotle From the cesspools of the Pope. ‘While the countless priests were lying, I was preaching and beseeching— Crying “The eternal godhead Helps but those who help themselves; ‘“Pestilence, Disease, and Famine Phantoms are of God's creation— Man alone hath power to slay them, Knowing good and knowing evil; ‘“Eat, then, of the tree of knowledge As your parents did in Eden— Eat, and though your limbs be naked Earth will yield you decent clothing! ‘“God who knoweth, feeleth nothing, Cannot help you!—Tho' 'tis written Not a sparrow falls without Him, Ne'ertheless—the sparrow falls!” ‘Yea, by Hades, I was busy! In the monasteries even, Many a learnèd monk was lesson'd By the Devil whom he dreaded; ‘While the shaven head was nodding Over parchment and papyrus, I persuaded the good fellow To transcribe my carnal books! ‘Aye, and in their written Bibles, Full of priestly contradictions, I contrived to mingle deftly Human truths with holy lies. ‘True it is, indeed, I tempted Both St. Anthony and Luther— Proving to their consternation Only fools despise the Flesh! ‘I it was who fired the Painters, Bade them fling upon the canvas Holy infants and Madonnas Warm with nakedness and love; ‘I it was who made them picture Christ the Shepherd, sweet and human, Bright and young, with fond eyes gazing On the rosy Magdalena! ‘Thus with Life and Love and Beauty War'd I on the side of Nature, Knowing well that Man's salvation Must be wrought of flesh and blood! ‘Yea, and to the Priest I whisper'd: “Rise erect, thou Beast, in manhood! Reverence thy sex and function— Snatch the fruits of Love and Joy! ‘“He who scorns the Flesh despises Nature's Holiest of Holies— In the Body's Temple only Burns that mystic lamp, the Soul!” ‘I alone whom men call'd Devil, I, who fought for Truth and Knowledge, I, the scorn'd and fabled Serpent, Loved the human form divine! ‘“Crouch no more to gods or idols, Crawl no more in filth and folly, Stand erect,” I cried to mortals, “Take your birthright, and be free! ‘“What ye take not freely, boldly, From the brimming hands of Nature, God the Lord will never give you,— God the Lord gives all, yet nothing!” ‘Still they heark'd to their bell-wether, Still they stumbled in the shambles, Still they fumbled with their crosses, Dwindling back to brutes and beasts. ‘Westward then I sent Columbus! Southward then I sent Magellan! Starward, sunward, I, the Devil, Turn'd Galileo's starry eyes! ‘Crying, while the screech-owl Churches Shriek'd their twenty-fold damnations, “See and know! demand your birthright! Search the suns and map the spheres!”’ XXI. For a space the starry splendour Flash'd upon him out of Heaven, As, with eager arms extended, Angel-like he upward gazed; Then again the cloud of sorrow Fell upon him; darkly drooping, Grew his form more sadly human, As he proudly spoke again. ‘While the tribes of priests and liars Rear'd their shrines and lazar-houses, Sold their charms and absolutions, Did their clumsy Miracles, ‘I to shame their winking Virgins, Sweating Christs, and minor marvels, Was with all my might preparing For a miracle indeed! ‘Of my letters cabalistic Tiny blocks of wood I fashion'd, Ranged them patiently in order (Chuckling slyly up my sleeve); ‘Then I fasten'd them together, Smear'd them o'er with ink from Hades, Stamp'd the words on leaves papyric— And the Miracle was done! ‘I, the Devil, invented printing! Calling to my aid the youngest Of my sons, my little darling Benjamin, the Printer's Devil. ‘First I printed (mark my cunning!) God's own Book, the Christian Bible, Turn'd it out in fine black-letter, So that he who ran might read! ‘Thus, observe, I pin'd the churchmen Down to very verse and chapter! Thus, sir, for the good times coming, I was nailing Lie on Lie! ‘This was only the beginning Of my Miracle! The moment I produced that great invention, Light and Liberty were born! ‘Suddenly arose and blossom'd Man's new Tree of Good and Evil, Shedding forth its leaves abundant, Ripening to golden fruit! ‘Large it grew and ever larger, Ever putting forth fresh members,— “Lop it! cut it down! destroy it!” Cried the churchmen, shriek'd the Popes. ‘All the priests of all the Churches Rush'd to smite it with their axes,— Fools! for every twig so smitten Out there sprang a magic branch! ‘As from some strong oak, moreover, Growing in the merry greenwood, From my Tree of Good and Evil Acorns dropt, and oaklings sprouted; ‘Little birds pick'd up the acorns, Dropt them down in distant places,— Wheresoe'er the seed was carried, New trees rose, till forests grew! ‘“Shun that leafage diabolic! 'Ware that wicked fruit of Knowledge!” Croak'd the ravens of the Churches, Hovering o'er it in the air; ‘But the maiden and the lover Sat beneath its shade and listen'd, While the merry leaves were lisping Songs that shepherds sang of yore; ‘Here the footsore and the weary, Creeping from the dusty highway, Lay beneath and hearken'd smiling To the magic talking branches; ‘Kings arrived with trains attendant Saying “Here at least 'tis pleasant!” From my magic Tree they gather'd Runes of Norseland, tales of Troy. ‘Reaching to my Tree, Erasmus Gather'd gentle leaves of learning, On the greensward underneath it Petrarch and his Laura walk'd! ‘Even rough old Martin Luther Pluck'd a leaf and smiled approval! Gazing upward in the starlight, Abelard wept, and Tasso sang! ‘Nay, the very monks came flocking Open-mouth'd to look and listen,— Charm'd they slyly sow'd my seedlings In the monastery garden! ‘Wheresoe'er my Tree enchanted Spread its branches cabalistic, Gladness grew, and wise men gather'd, And 'twas Fairyland once more! ‘Vain were all their winking Virgins, Sweating Christs, and minor marvels,— I, the Devil, had done the latest, Greatest Miracle of all! XXII. ‘Since that hour the Fight hath lasted! Strong, beneficent, and gentle, I, the foe of all the Churches, Have remain'd the friend of Man. ‘All the horde of Priests and Prophets, Moonstruck, mad, have rail'd against me, Crying to the weary nations “Fear the Flesh, and shun the Devil!” ‘In the name of God the Father They have sicken'd Earth with slaughter; In the name of their Messiahs They have lied, and lied, and lied! ‘O'er the vineyards I have planted They have scatter'd seed of thistles; In the mansions of my making They have swarm'd with fire and sword. ‘Year by year, with God against me, I for Humankind have striven, Winning patiently and slowly Thro' a small minority! ‘Poor are all the Church's martyrs, By the side of mine, the Devil's! Those have died for Filth and Falsehood, These for Liberty and Light! ‘Mine the Seers and mine the Poets, Stoned and slain in every nation! Even those who most denied me Learn'd thro' me to stand erect! ‘I it was who put the honey On the tongue of Ariosto! I who cast a light from Heaven On Boccaccio's golden page! ‘In the ear of many a monarch I was whispering my reasons— Taught by me, your bluff King Harry Faced the Pope and flay'd the cowls! ‘Aye, and in your thronèd Virgin I inspired both wit and learning— I was hunting gladly with her, When she whipt the wolves of Spain. ‘While the Priests were busy burning, I created Merrymakers! Rock'd, despite the shrieking Churches, Rabelais in his easy-chair! ‘In your land of fogs and vapours, Where the church-bells toll'd for ever, I, the Devil, upraised the Drama Still by priestcraft shun'd and curst: ‘First I bribed the monks to help me, Made them place on mimic stages (Little 'ware what they were doing) Plays of miracles absurd. ‘God Himself and little Jesus Were by mortals represented, While myself and other devils Join'd them in the pagan dance. ‘Thus, without a word of warning, Rose the Theatre, my Temple! Sunny as the soul of Nature, Fearless, beautiful, and free! ‘“Shun it! shun the Devil's dwelling!” Shriek'd the jealous cowls; but straightway, Loud, the prelude of the battle, Thunder'd Marlowe's mighty line! ‘There I taught your gentle Shakespeare What no shaven monk could teach him— Mingled wit and wisdom, foreign To a God who never smiles! ‘Churchmen curst, and still are cursing What transcends their sermonizing, Hating, in the way of traders, Rival shops with smarter wares. ‘In my Temple rose the voices Of the Seers and Music-makers,— Shapes of beauty and of terror Waken'd to the conjuration! ‘There the glad green world was pictured, There the lark sang “tirra-lirra,” There the piteous human pageant Broke to tears or rippled laughter— ‘“Shun it, shun the Devil's dwelling!” Croaked the jackdaws from the steeple— Long as Shakespeare's lark is singing, Still my Theatre shall stand!.... ‘Then I mock'd their tracts and sermons With my songs and my romances: Light and Freedom, Mirth and Music, Scatter'd sunshine through the air. ‘Milton even, tho' intending To exalt the Lord Almighty, Spread my teaching Manichæan— Who's his hero?—I, the Devil! ‘Aye, and when his voice demanded Freedom for my printing presses, Liberty of speech for all men, Who inspired him? I, the Devil! ‘Then, to mock their monkish fables, I invoked my Story-tellers! Till at last, full-blown and bounteous, Bloom'd the Modern Novelist! ‘True, the Novel is elephantine, Pachydermatous, long-winded, Of all Art the large negation, Yet, by Heaven! it serves a turn! ‘My Cervantes and my Fielding Struck the rock of human knowledge, Freed the founts of Fun, still foreign To a God who never laughs! ‘How the Priests and Preachers trembled At my quips and cranks and fancies, Furious when I requisition'd Rogues, like Sterne, within the fold! ‘Evermore my printing presses Labour'd, and across my kingdom, Thick as leaves in Vallombrosa, Fell the merry carnal books! ‘Then, like sunshine made incarnate, Rose the merry Djinn of Fiction,— How the laughter of my Dickens Scared the ravens and the owls! ‘Then, the knell of all ascetics Sounded, as my Reade upstarted, Flooding all the gloomy Cloister With the fires of Hearth and Home!

Angry at my benefactions, He was wakening very slowly To the peril long impending. ... ‘Over yonder where the people Groan'd like oxen yoked together, Goaded on o'er stony fallows By the Princes and the Priests, ‘Where the Abbé curl'd and scented Told his beads and lay with harlots, While the Christ of Superstition Dallied with the Pompadour, ‘I, the Devil, in indignation Raised my periwig'd Alter Ego, Darling son of my adoption, Whom the people named Voltaire! ‘Diabolically smiling, Up to Priest and Prince he strutted, Tap'd his snuff-box, and politely Crack'd his jokes at the Madonna! ‘Nought of holy reputation 'Scaped the ribald rascal's laughter— Far away as Rome the Churches Echo'd with his jests profane; ‘Then behold, a transformation! Suddenly he rose transfigured, Periwig and snuff-box vanish'd, And an Angel stood reveal'd! ‘In his hand my sword of Freedom Flashing on the eyes of Europe,— While the hounds of persecution Paused, and Calas kiss'd his feet! ‘Then, while far as Rome the tumult Rang, and voices shriek'd “Destroy him!” “Lo, 'tis Antichrist arisen! Smite him, in the name of God!” ‘At the lifting of my finger Stormy spirits gather'd round him— Strong and calm arose Condorcet, Strong and fierce stood Diderot. ‘Day by day the war was waging,— I, the Devil, and my Titans, 'Gainst the God of Popes and Bibles And His deputies on earth! ‘Till at last the flames of battle Caught the curtains of the palace,— Panic-stricken 'mong the people Rush'd a monarch God-anointed. ‘Then began the conflagration,— Mitres, crosiers, crowns and sceptres, Mingled up with moaning mortals, Fed the ever increasing fires! ‘I, the Devil, wept for pity, While the bale-fires rose to Heaven,— I, the Ishmael of the Angels, Sicken'd at the fumes of blood. ‘'Midst that carnage all the cruel Parasites of God were busy,— Ignorance, His page-in-waiting, Death, His master of the hounds! ‘Vainly to the madden'd people Cried my Titans, interceding For the innocent and gentle Seized to feed the conflagration. ‘Not a hair of beast and mortal Ever fell through me, the Devil,— From the first my rebel spirit Bled and wept for the afflicted. ‘Death and Pain were God's conception, Never mine, the Prince of Pity's! If they dwell within my kingdom, I, the Devil, am not to blame. ‘I for ages after ages Had proclaimed the truth to mortals— “God is powerless to redeem you, In yourselves abides salvation; ‘“Love each other, help each other, Eat the golden fruit forbidden,— Out of Knowledge ripely gather'd Wisdom comes and Freedom grows!”... ‘Out of evil, evil springeth,— Even so, in Hell and Paris, Centuries of evil sowing Turn to aftermath of Hate! ‘Lastly, from the conflagration Sprang a spirit, man or Devil,— Whether God or I begat him I could never quite discover! ‘Diabolically clever, Strong as any of my Titans, Impudent as any Devil, Rose the little Corporal!... ‘I incline to think the fellow Was a sort of blood-relation Who, by lust of loot perverted, Join'd the legions of the Lord! ‘O'er the nations sick with slaughter Many a night and day he gallopt— God had lent him Death's White Charger (Well described in Revelation)— ‘Death himself, afoot, ran after With the hosts of the Grand Army, Feeding well, where'er he followed, On the flesh and blood of mortals. ... ‘After all, and on reflection, I reject this Demi-devil, Since within his soul there quicken'd Neither love nor human kindness ‘(Which, I hold, are the supremest Qualities of true revolters);— Yes, God played a trick upon me, Thro' a devilish renegade! ‘Down in Hell are decent people, Honest souls who love their fellows;— To the cruel God of Battles I relinquish Buonaparté!’ XXIV. All the glory of the angel Now had utterly departed— Quietly he now addressed me, Calm and modern as at first; On the lonely Heath at Hampstead Sat my Devil, grimly smiling, In his hand the evening journal, Spectacles upon his nose. ... ‘Troubled by the devastation Laying waste my little kingdom, Showing that the Lord Almighty Wrought against me as of old; ‘Sick because the blinded masses Clamour'd still for signs and portents, “Time it surely is,” I mutter'd, “For another Miracle!” ‘So, my Benjamin assisting, I the Newspaper invented— 'Gainst the Church's red battalions Rose at last the thin black line! ‘Nought that Priests and Tyrants plotted, Nought that mortals did or suffer'd, Nought that passes on this planet, Any more remained in darkness! ‘Nay, I tamed the very Lightning To assist my revelations— Thro' the night it took its tidings Flashing into fiery words: ‘On the walls of hut and palace Flamed my messages to mortals— Startled 'mid the feast, Earth's rulers Looked aghast at one another! ‘All the affairs of Hell and Heaven By my servants were recorded,— I had watchful correspondents Even in the Vatican! ‘For the first time human creatures Knew the affliction of their fellows— Tyrants blush'd to find recorded Deeds they had not blush'd to do! ‘O my Benjamin, the youngest Of my sons, the Printer's Devil! I myself at times was startled At the rogue's irreverence! ‘Nought that God had done in darkness Could escape his circumspection! All the evils God created Now were patent to the world!’ ‘Even so,’ I answer'd quickly, ‘Thanks to thee, O woeful Spirit, Ever prying and denying, Nought is hid from eyes profane: ‘Ignorance is at last completed By this thing of thy creation,— Foul as any other priestcraft Is the priestcraft of the Press! ‘Clamour of thy Printer's Devil Silences the wise and holy, Life grows hideous, while his shameful, Shameless scandals fill the air; ‘By the filth thou namest Knowledge All the springs of life are poison'd,— Foul St. Simeons of the column Pose, and proffer absolution! ‘Poison of thy fiends was scatter'd On the world-worn eyes of Coleridge; Poison'd daggers of thy devils Stab'd to Keats's heart of hearts! ‘Foulest of all human follies Is the Newspaper!’ I added— ‘Art and all things fair and holy Fade at last before its breath!’ Scornfully he smiled upon me,— ‘Grant,’ he said, ‘my servant blunders; In a scheme so democratic Individual merit fails. ‘Yet, with all its limitations This, the latest of my labours, Is a boon of light and leading To the woe-worn race of men. ‘Priests have cried, “Let there be darkness! Hide away the truths thou fearest!” I, the Devil, being wiser, Cry, “Let Truth and Light prevail!” ‘By the printed words, the record Of the conscience of the people, By my clamouring Printer's Devil, Freedom spreads from land to land: ‘Deeds of night no more are hidden, Deeds of grace are multiplying; Light into the dungeon flowing Strikes the fetters of the slave. ‘At my printed protestation On his throne the Tyrant trembles; Words of hope for Freedom utter'd, Shake the footstool of the Czar! ‘Even the lying leader writer Pillories the God he praises! Even the critic speeds the triumph Of the Seer he mocks and scorns! ‘Ever in my open daylight Truth and falsehood stand together— In the daylight Falsehood withers, Truth is known and justified! ‘Those who serve your God Almighty Cry aloud “The Light is hateful!” In the night His Church has flourish'd, In the daylight it doth fall! ‘War not, in thy soul's impatience, 'Gainst my busy benediction! Rail not, Poet, 'gainst my Devils, Wroth because they will not praise thee! ‘If thy soul be just and gentle, Be thou sure that men shall know it! If thy song be great and deathless, God nor devil can destroy it! ‘I, the Devil, refuse to foster Vanity in God or poets! Both believe in loaves and fishes And in fulsome adulation. ‘I, the Devil, am democratic! For the general good I labour— Those who would be prais'd and petted I relinquish to the Tories. ‘Tennyson I liked extremely (Even pardon'd him for praising That white sepulchre, King Arthur) Till he join'd the House of Lords. ‘Light and Knowledge for the masses, Speech for Wisdom and for Folly, These I claim, and even the zany May announce his zanyhood; ‘Busily my printing presses Publish all things, good or evil: When my printer's Devil blunders 'Tis at least in open day. ‘Light is Death to Falsehood ever! Light illumes my printing presses! Ev'n thro' fools my truth shall triumph And my Demos witch the world!’ XXV. For a space he paused, and gazing Proudly upward to the heavens, Where the countless constellations Clustered close as if to listen, Lost he seem'd in contemplation Of the shining lights above him, While the soft celestial splendour On his woe-worn face was raining. ‘Heir,’ he said, ‘of all Earth's sorrow, Brother of those lonely spirits Who on yonder stars and planets Still perform their tasks allotted, ‘I, the outcast Prince of Pity, Have at last to Man unfolded All the story of Creation, Birth and Death, and Evolution. ‘I have taught him how to measure Yonder spheres and their processions,— Seizing for his apprehension God's abstractions, Space and Time! ‘What Galileo dreamed, what Bruno Guess'd from sleepless inspiration, I at last have demonstrated Thro' the mouths of mighty thinkers. ‘Open lies the Book of Heaven! Children even may read its pages,— Stranger far than any fable Is the record of Creation! ‘Nay, the mind of Man may follow God into the depths of darkness— From the wonders Seen divining Those Unseen, and yet not hidden! ‘By my symbols algebraic I have counted lands and waters, With my chemics cabalistic I have solved the Elemental! ‘Further, to the sight of mortals, I the womb of Earth have open'd— Showing how, through endless ages, Man's strange embryos were fashion'd! ‘Nay, and to their wondering vision I have map'd the life within them— Clear as yonder starry Heaven Lies the microcosm, Man! ‘Wondrous as the Light lifegiving Thro' the Universe pulsating, Floweth Light in Man, the Unit, From the heart, its central Sun. ‘As the cell that builds the planet Is the cell that builds the mortal— As the greater is the lesser, As the lesser is the greater. ‘Thro' my love and benediction Man has plumb'd the abyss of Being— By the law that never endeth Life and Death revolve for ever. ‘All the arts by God forbidden, All the knowledge hid in darkness, I reveal, while the Creator Rests in impotence of Godhead. ‘Nay, I show that God is fetter'd By the chains of His own making— Blind and bound He broods, while Nature Moveth on in calm progression. ‘Thro' my love and benediction Man hath learn'd the gifts of Healing— Now for every Church that falleth Hospitals arise to Heaven; ‘Strong, beneficent, and gentle, Christs of surgery and leechcraft Work their wonders, far more holy Than the marvels of Messiahs. ‘Wheresoever Death is busy Fly my ministers of blessing, Snatching ever from his talons Creatures beautiful and fair. ‘Cast thy look along the ages! Read the record of the Churches! Pestilence, Disease, and Famine Fill the footprints of the Christ! ‘Thro' the very Fruit Forbidden, Thro' the laws of Light and Knowledge, I have fought with Death and Evil, Conquering, in despite of God— ‘Curst, and yet the source of blessing, Outcast, yet supreme 'mong Angels, I, the only true Redeemer, Work my miracles for men!’ XXVI. Smiling scornfully, I answer'd:— ‘Strange it seems to find the Devil, 'Spite a record so despairing, Optimistic, after all! ‘Yet, methinks, thy boasted Demos Is the very worst of tyrants! Better far a single Cæsar Than a Cæsar hydra-headed! ‘Gaze again upon thy kingdom! Look on Rome! As thou didst wander In the streets of Rome departed, Sick of God and God's creation, ‘So from day to day I wander In the City of thy Demos,— Demos is a fouler Cæsar, London is a lewder Rome! ‘Still the Priests and Seers and Prophets Preach the faith they feel no longer— Keeping to the ear the promise They have broken to the Soul; ‘Still the slaves and tyrants palter With the truth they dare not utter— Still the spectral Man of Sorrows Starveth at the Church's door; ‘Still, to blind the foolish people, With the worn-out creed men juggle,— Even o'er their cheating parchments Smiling lawyers hold the Cross; ‘Atheist judges, cold and cruel, Toss the murtherer to the hangman, Crying, while they shrung their shoulders, “God have mercy on thy soul!” ‘Dark and dissolute and dreadful As that other Rome departed, Is this later Rome and lewder,— Death is crownèd here as there! ‘Last, thy Demos, while denying All Divinity, assevers He's essentially a Christian Since he leads a moral life!’ Smiling quietly my Devil Answer'd, ‘True, O angry Poet— There my Demos errs: Messiahs Always are immoral persons! ‘If the Christ of Superstition Work'd no miracles or wonders, If the man was well-conducted, He was surely no Messiah!’ Sadly, wearily, he added: ‘Here as in the Rome departed Priests abide and Folly lingers Conquering in the name of God; ‘Priests abide, but Death is reigning! Thus, in spite of God, I triumph! Patience, patience, for my Demos Groweth wiser day by day! ‘'Tis the way of foolish mortals, When they cease to feel religion, To become severely moral, Hating Liberty and Light— ‘So, I grant, my woe-worn Demos Makes Morality his fetish, Closing ears and shutting eyelids To the sanctions of the Flesh. ‘Patience, patience! I will teach him Love that passeth understanding! All the wondrous lore of Nature Shall be open to his gaze! ‘This, at least, is certain: Never Will he lose again his birthright! Never bend before his tyrants, Here on earth, or there in Heaven! ‘Never will he kneel and listen To the lies of your Messiahs, Forfeit for a fancied blessing Light and Liberty and Life! ‘Patience, patience! Light is growing— God at last shall be forgotten— Man shall rise erect, subduing All things evil, even Death!’ XXVII. ‘If thou speakest truth,’ I answer'd, ‘Much, indeed, thou hast been libel'd! Yet thy very benedictions Spring from Him, the first Creator. ‘By the will of Him, the Father, Thou hast wrought to cleanse thy kingdom— From the first His eyes, all-seeing, Knew thee as His instrument! ‘If Mankind, tho' dimly, darkly, Moveth onward to perfection, If at last the ills of Nature Shall be heal'd and render'd whole, ‘Even there I trace the Finger Of the Almighty slowly working, Till the hour when thou, His servant, Kneeling low shalt be forgiven! ‘Then Humanity, made holy, Kneeling also to the Father, Shall accept His final blessing And be lifted up and saved!’ Wistfully he lookt upon me, Once again his face was clouded With that mist of woeful pity, While his eyes grew dim with tears... Then, another transformation! Bright and radiant, tho' despairing, Rose he to his angel's stature, Looking up with starry orbs; While the stars and constellations, Fixing countless eyes upon him, Shed upon his woe-worn features Splendour from a million worlds, In a voice like stars vibrating, Answer'd by the hosts of Heaven, Cried he, while his troubled spirit Shook with woeful indignation: ‘Cast thy thought along the Ages! Walk the sepulchres of Nations! Mourn, with me, the fair things perish'd! Mark the martyrdoms of men! ‘Say, can any latter blessing Cleanse the blood-stain'd Book of Being? Can a remnant render'd happy Wipe out centuries of sorrow? ‘Nay, one broken life outweigheth Twenty thousand lives made perfect! Nay, I scorn the God whose pathway Lieth over bleeding hearts! ‘From the first the cry of anguish Hath arisen to yonder Heaven! From the first, the ways of Nature Have been cruel and accurst! ‘Man, thou sayest, shall yet be happy? What avails a bliss created Out of hecatombs of evil, Out of endless years of pain? ‘Happy? Looking ever backward On the graves of generations, Haunted by the eyes despairing Of the millions lost for ever? ‘Even now the life he liveth Builded is of shame and sorrow! Even now his flesh is fashion'd Of the creatures that surround him! ‘From the sward the stench of slaughter Riseth hourly to his nostrils! By his will the beast doth anguish And the wounded dove doth die! ‘Dreamer! Even here thy fancy Fails before the truths of Nature— God, thy great all-loving Father, By His will created Death!— ‘Like the races long departed, So the perfect race shall perish! Like the suns burnt out and faded, Shall thy sun be shrivell'd up! ‘Juggle not with words and phrases! Lie not with the Priests and Prophets! Pain and Death are God's creation, And eternal, like Himself! ‘I alone, whom men call Devil, Have allay'd the woes of Nature! Death alone I cannot vanquish— Death and God, perchance, are One!’ XXVIII. O, the sorrow and the splendour Of that woe-worn Outcast Angel! Reverently I bent before him, Blessing him, the Prince of Pity; Round him, as he look'd to Heaven, Clung a cloud of golden music— Fair he seem'd as when, ere fallen, Singing on the morning star! ‘Thus,’ he said, ‘throughout the ages, O'er the world my feet have wander'd, Watching in eternal pity Endless harvest-fields of Death! ‘One by one the tribes and races To the silent grave have waver'd,— Never have I seen a sleeper Slip his shroud, to rise again! ‘Dead they lie, the strong, the gentle, Dead alike, the good and evil,— Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, All is o'er—they rest at last! ‘All the tears of all the martyrs Fall'n in vain for Man's redemption! All the souls of all the singers Dumb for ever in the grave! ‘Where are they whose busy fingers Wove the silks of Tyre and Sidon? Where are they who in the desert Raised the mighty Pyramids? ‘Ants upon an ant-heap, insects Of the crumbling cells of coral, Coming ever, ever going, Race on race has lived and died. ‘Ev'n as Babylon departed, So shall yonder greater City; Like the Assyrian, like the Roman, Celt and Briton shall depart! ‘Yea, the Cities and the Peoples One by one have come and vanish'd: Broken, on the sandy desert, Lies the Bull of Nineveh! ‘Ev'n as beauteous reefs of coral Rising bright and many-colour'd In the midst of the great waters, Wondrous Nations have arisen; ‘First the insects that upbuilt them Labour'd busily, and dying Left the reef of their creation Crumbling wearily away; ‘O'er the reef the salt ooze gathers, Mud and sand are heapt upon it, Then the trees and flowers and grasses Bury it for evermore! ‘Shall I bend in adoration To the Lord of these delusions? Nay, I stand erect, and scorn Him,— Pulseless, null Omnipotence! ‘Deaf to all the wails and weeping, Blind to all the woes of Being, Plunging daily into darkness All the dreams of all the Christs!’ XXIX. ‘Nay,’ I cried, ‘the Christ shall triumph! After centuries of sorrow Man at last shall gain his birthright And arise, a living Soul! ‘Proves not this that One above thee Wrought in love from the beginning? Creeds and systems come and vanish, But the Law Divine abides! ‘Out of endless tribulation Springs the Human, casting from him One by one the sins and sorrows Worn in ignorance of godhead; ‘All around him and within him Lies his Kingdom, but he rules it By the grace of One Supremer Who created it and him! ‘“Know thyself!” the Voice Eternal Crieth; and himself he knoweth, God incarnate, bowing meekly To the Eternal Voice and Law. ‘Even thus thy God hath conquer'd! What thy spirit wrought against Him Turneth ever to a witness Of His glory everlasting! ‘Kneel, then, rebel, and adore Him! Kneel with Man and chant His praises, Hallelujah to the Highest, As 'twas sung in the beginning!’ Pallid in the moonlight, turning Sad eyes upward to the Heavens, Head erect, still proud in sorrow, Stood that weary fallen Spirit! ‘Fool,’ he answer'd, ‘what availeth Praise or prayer or lamentation? Blindly, pitilessly, surely, Worketh the Eternal Law. ‘Dust to dust, ashes to ashes; Nought escapeth, nought abideth— Man, the sand for ever shifting In an hour-glass, cometh, goeth! ‘Death alone is King and Master! Death is mightiest here and yonder,— Man, the drop within a fountain, Riseth ever, ever falleth! ‘Vain the Dream and the Endeavour! Vain the quest of Love and Knowledge,— Man, the dewdrop in the Rainbow, Shineth, then is drunk for ever! ‘Answerest thou, that nought can perish? That the elements for ever Disappearing, re-emerging, Shape themselves to Life anew? ‘Even so; but Death shall silence All that forms thy human nature— Memory, consciousness, self-knowledge, Personality, and Love! ‘Out of darkness God hath drawn thee, Back to darkness thou returnest— In that moment of thy making Thou becam'st a conscious Soul! ‘Loving, hoping, apprehending, Yearning to the Souls around thee,— Father, mother, wife and children, Sharers of thy joy and sorrow; ‘These are thou, and these must vanish Leaving not a trace behind them— With the Elemental godhead Thou and these shall mix for ever! ‘The Supreme, the Elemental, Voiceless is, and all unconscious! But the conscious type emerging Shineth, and is trumpet-tongued! ‘From the dark he cometh, standing Beautiful and demigod-like, Crying gladly, “Lo my kingdom, Where I reign as God's anointed;” ‘Knowing, feeling, apprehending, Thus he cometh to his birthright— Memory, consciousness, self-knowledge, Personality, and Love! ‘Fool, Death taps him on the shoulder, Death, the wraith of the Almighty, Saying, “Cease! The law of being Meaneth endless retrogression! ‘“Back into the Night! re-mingle With the elemental Darkness! Only for a little moment God permits thee to abide!” ‘Broken-hearted and despairing, Into silence he returneth— Dust to dust, ashes to ashes! Crush'd he lies, a crumbling shell! ‘Name me not the Prince of Evil,— Call me still the Prince of Pity, Since alone among immortals I have wept for human woes! ‘What remaineth? One thing only, Since Death cometh soon or later: Carpe diem! While it lasteth, Stand erect, Ephemeron! ‘Waste no thought on the Almighty; Seek, with all thy soul's endeavour, How to make thine earthly dwelling Bright and fair, in God's despite! ‘Only for a day thou livest! Make that day, so quickly fleeting, For thyself, for all thou lovest, Beautiful with Light and Joy! ‘Yet, the pity! ah, the pity! Back, far back, along the ages, Stretch the graves of countless creatures Who have borne the Cross for thee! ‘They, too, loved the light that lieth On the seas and on the mountains! They, too, by their God forsaken, Died at last on Calvary! ‘They, too, dreamed of Life Eternal! They, too, knelt before the Father! They, too, clung to one another, Till He drave them back to dust!’ XXX. As he spake, I saw around me Once again the Apparitions Moving ant-wise hither and thither 'Neath the glimpses of the moon; Faces of the dead departed Glimmer'd on me from the shadows, While a sound of woeful voices Faintly wailing fill'd the air: And again (which still was strangest!) Never one did gaze upon me, Though I named them wildly sobbing, Stretching hungry empty arms: Then at last my soul within me Sicken'd, and the air around me, Even as seas around the drowning, Swung,—till sense and sight departed!... XXXI. On the lonely Heath of Hampstead I awoke, and as I waken'd Saw the Devil departing from me Thro' the shadows of the night; Limping lame, and bending double, Like a venerable mortal, Round he turn'd, before he vanish'd, Sigh'd, and fixed his eyes on mine. (Ah, the sleepless eyes, so woeful With the wisdom of the Serpent! Ah, the piteous face so weary With the woes of all the worlds!) Forcing then his wrinkled features To a smile, and grimly laughing— ‘Plead,’ he said, ‘for the Defendant! Be my Laureate, yet remember: ‘If the priests were right, and yonder Waited Heaven and compensation, I'd at once admit my folly, Taking off my hat to God!’ Nodding quietly, he vanish'd While again I sadly wander'd O'er the lonely Heath of Hampstead, Thro' the silence of the Night. . . . XXXII. Little did I dream or fancy I should ever (God forgive me!) State the Case for the Defendant Whom I loath'd with all my soul! From a race of cattle stealers, Rievers of the clan Buchanan, I, Buchanan, sprang—the riever's Savage blood is in my veins; Thieves and wolves we were, but never Foxes, and our Celtic motto Reads in Roman lingo—‘Magnest Veritas et prevalebit!’ Tell the truth and shame the Devil! Tell it, even tho' it praise him! Tell the truth for the Defendant, Tho' the Accuser be thy God! Better still—let the Defendant Plead his Case in his own person: Tho' it means thine own damnation Let the awful truth prevail! . . . Yet, alas! that happy Eden! All the golden, gladsome Garden! God the Father smiling on us, Raining gentle blessings down! Eve, that ne'er shalt be a mother, Wrap thy sleeping shroud about thee! All is over, all is over,— But the Devil was not to blame! THE LITANY. DE PROFUNDIS. O God our Father in Heaven, Holy, Unseen, and Unknown, Have mercy on us Thy children, who pray beneath Thy Throne!

Son that had never a Father, Father that never had Son, Here on the Earth and yonder in Heaven, Thy will be done. Son that had never a Father, Father that never had son, Here on the Earth and yonder in Heaven, Thy will be done. Remember not our offences, O Father and Lord Divine, Pity and spare Thy children, whose sins and offences are Thine; For if they are blind and see not, 'tis Thou who closest their eyes, And if they are frail and foolish, 'tis Thou who shouldst make them wise! And be not angry, O Father, but sheathe Thine avenging Sword, Spare the things of Thy making, love them and spare them, O Lord We are the things of Thy making, spare us and love us, O Lord. From all things hateful and evil, which come, O Father, from Thee, From Sin, the Flesh, and the Devil, whom Thou permittest to be, From what through Thee we suffer, since Thou hast made men thus, From lesser and greater damnation, O Lord, deliver us! From lesser and greater damnation O Lord, deliver us. From pride and from vain glory, from all hypocrisy, From envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharity, From filth, from fornication, from all things vile and abhorred Which leaven the bread of Thy making, deliver us, O Lord. From filth, from fornication, from all things vile and abhorred Which leaven the bread of Thy making, deliver us, O Lord. From thine avenging Lightning! from Fire and Famine and Pest! From all the terrors and portents Thy Will makes manifest!

From all the woes of Creation, good Lord, deliver us. We are the things of Thy making, we are the clouds of Thy breath! Life hast Thou made, O Father, to flee for ever from Death, Flesh Thou hast wrapt around us, Flesh and the lusts of the same, Out of Thy Word 'twas fashion'd, out of Thy mouth they came! From all the doubt and the darkness Thy vials of wrath have poured To blind the spirits that seek Thee, deliver us, good Lord. From all the doubt and the darkness Thy vials of wrath have poured To blind the spirits that seek Thee, deliver us, good Lord. Thou hast set these Rulers above us, to bind us, to blind our eyes, Thou hast sent these Priests to lure us with creeds and dogmas and lies, Thou hast built Thy Church on the sands still shifting and tremulous: From Churches, and Priests, and Liars, good Lord, deliver us. From Churches, and Priests, and Liars, good Lord, deliver us. By Thyself Incarnate within us, Thy Voice in our aching ears, By Thy birth and Thy circumcision, Thy baptism of tears, By fasting and by temptation, from all the passionate horde Of Devils that seize and slay us, deliver us, good Lord. By fasting and by temptation, from all the passionate horde Of Devils that seize and slay us, deliver us, good Lord. By the woe Thou hast never felt, by the Cross and the Crown of Thorn, By the agony and the sweat on the brow of Thine Eldest Born, By the cry that never was answer'd and ringeth ever aloud, By the tomb that never was open'd, the dust therein, and the shroud, By Him who sleepeth for ever, while we implore Thee thus, From death and from tribulation, good Lord, deliver us. From death and from tribulation, good Lord, deliver us. Strengthen our hearts to know Thee, O God that cannot be known! Make righteous the Kings who rule us, and sit on an earthly throne! Set in their hands Thy sceptre, place in their hands Thy sword— Help us to bear their yoke! We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord. Shine on the eyes of Thy Priests, illumine Thy Bishops, shed Lightnings to quicken life in the creeds that are pulseless and dead. When the Holy supper is set, and the Ghost of the Christ at the board Sits, be Thou there in our midst! We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord. Instruct the Lords of the Council! endow the brain of the Fool! Bless and preserve our Masters who sit in high places and rule! But when in their granaries yonder the harvest of toil is stored, Spare us some mouthfuls of bread! We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord. Father that dwellest in Heaven, so far from the sorrows of Earth, Soften to us, Thy children, the travails of Death and of Birth, Teach us to love Thee and dread Thee, to eat the bread of Thy Word, Altho' it be hard as stone! We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord. We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord, when darkness and sorrow are near us, When blindly we grope thro' the dark, good Lord, we beseech Thee to hear us, We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord, and send Thy Spirit to cheer us! When Thy yoke is hardest to bear, good Lord, we beseech Thee to hear us. Help us when we are falling, as we help others who fall! By land and by sea preserve us, O Father, Maker of all! Comfort the sick and the weary with tidings of hope and of peace, All children, all women who labour that what Thou hast made may increase, Open the gates to the captive, lift up the weak and forlorn, Feed, too, the fatherless orphans, comfort the widows that mourn. Have mercy, Father in Heaven, and send Thy spirit to cheer us, We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord! Good Lord, we beseech Thee to hear us. O Father who canst not conquer our sorrow, since it is Thine! Maker who cannot unmake us, since we, like Thee, are divine! Light that dwellest within us, Light that art far away! Nearest to, farthest from us, answer our prayers when we pray! Lord, have mercy upon us! Send Thy Spirit to cheer us! Have mercy and hear us, O Lord! O Lord, have mercy and hear us. Save us from all our enemies, Most High! In our afflictions, Lord, be ever nigh! Pity our sorrows, Fountain of all Light! And when we pray be near us day and night. Let us pray. THE PRAYER. Father, which art in Heaven, not here below! Be Thy Name hallowed, in that place of worth! And till Thy Kingdom cometh, and we know, Be Thy will done more tenderly on earth! Since we must live, give us our daily bread! Forgive our stumblings, since Thou mad'st us blind! If we offend Thee, Lord, at least forgive As tenderly as we forgive our kind. Spare us temptation, human or divine! Deliver us from evil, now and then! The Kingdom, Power, and Glory all are Thine For ever and for evermore. Amen. Let us pray. O God, Unseen, Unknown, yet dimly guessed By spirit and by sense, The miracle of Nature doth attest Thy dread Omnipotence! Teach us to love Thee, God and Lord of all, And lead us to Thy Light! We love Thee not, we are too weak and small, And Thou too Infinite! . . . . O God, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have told it unto us, That Thou canst uplift or cast down, redeem, or for ever undo us, The works Thou hast made we behold as dawn after dawn cometh breaking, But evil and pain and despair are blent with the worlds of Thy making,— Unveil the light of Thy Face, till all Thy dread ways become clear to us! Deliver us out of the Darkness! Bend down thro' Thy clouds and give ear to us. Glory be Thine, O Father, from all things fashion'd by Thee. As it was in the beginning, is, and ever shall be. The Ballad of Mary the Mother. (1897.) [Shepherds, wake, 'tis Christmas tide!] Shepherds, wake, 'tis Christmas tide! (Over the snow the bleak winds blow!) Follow, with yonder Star for guide, On Christmas day in the morning. ‘The way is dark, the way is long, We cheer the way with a blithesome song. ‘Thro' the valley and over the hill,— Hush, now hush, for the Star stands still! ‘It stands so still and it shines so clear— This is the place! Our Lord is here!’ Ye who have gifts, your gifts unfold— Wood of Lebanon, gems, and gold. Kneel, and shrive ye of your sin— Then lift the latch, and enter in. . . . . Alack, why stand ye weeping there? . . . . ‘The fire is out, and the hearth is bare! ‘Far have we wander'd thro' wintry gloom— To seek His cradle, and lo! His tomb! ‘Still overhead the Star shines clear, But only the dust of the dead lies here: ‘Ashes and dust in a frozen shroud, Wherefore we wonder and weep aloud! ‘Here He was born who long since died (Over the snow the bleak winds blow!) Dark is the bield this wintertide On Christmas day in the morning.’ ['Twas Mary, the woeful Mother] 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Came wandering footsore, And stood, with her rags around her, Outside the synagogue door. ‘O, who art thou, thou woeful woman, And what may thine errand be?’ ‘I am Mary, the Mother of thy Lord, And I come from Galilee.’ ‘Stand back, stand back, whoever thou art, Thou canst not enter here, Thy Son is doing His Father's work Among His brethren dear. ‘O woman, thou canst not enter now,’ The grim door-keeper said, ‘Thy Son is pouring the Wine of Life, And breaking the holy Bread.’ 'Twas Mary, the gentle Mother, Smiled, and laid bare her breast. ‘'Twas here he drank, and 'twas here he lay Both waking and at rest. ‘Go in, and tell him his Mother waits Out here among the crowd’— And as she spake, from far within She heard Him praying aloud. 'Twas one went in to the synagogue When the deep prayer was done,— ‘Rabbi, a woman is at the door, Who saith Thou art her Son. ‘Her bare feet bleed from the thorny ways 'Twixt here and Galilee, And with the woman Thy brethren come, And they would speak with Thee.’ The Lord stretch'd out His gentle hands To His disciples dear: ‘These are my mother, these are my brethren, None else may enter here! ‘I know no brethren, I know no mother, Save those who believe on Me! Who eat with Me of the Bread of Life My mother and brethren be!’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Stood at the open door; 'Twas Jesus passed on His Heavenward way And left her weeping sore. His eyes were fixed on the far-off skies As He left her there bereaven, He turned away from His mother's face To His Father's face in Heaven. As He wandered on from door to door She followed Him from afar; His face was bright as the moon in Heaven, And hers like a lonely star. It was Mary, the woeful Mother, Wept as she watched Him go Through the town, and up the height That looks on the sea below; And His feet were as swift as the wind, And His eyes were as bright as fire, And the face He turn'd to the shining Heaven Was wan with His heart's desire; And His dress was of white, white wool, And His breast and His feet were bare, And the light came down like His Father's Hand And lay on His golden hair! And she heard His voice from afar Crying o'er land and sea: ‘Father, my Father which art in Heaven, Shine down and strengthen me!’ It was Mary, the woeful Mother, Sat weeping on a stone,— It was Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Found her weeping alone. ‘O why dost thou weep so sadly, And why is thy grey head bowed?’ (And the smile came through her great black eyes Like the light through a summer cloud.) ‘Rise up, thou weariful woman, Rise up and come with me— Thou shalt sit this day in my palace bower And I will sit at thy knee; ‘And when my maidens have wash'd thy feet, And the feast is over and done, Thou shalt loosen thy lips and open thy heart And tell me of thy Son!’ It was Mary, the woeful Mother, Rose, weeping bitterlie, And leaning on Mary the Maiden Hied to her bower by the sea. As they walked through the fields of corn The birds were singing their song, But the voice of the Lord above them Rang out more clear and strong; And they saw the crowd on the mountain Gathering with glad acclaim, And the Lord was standing above them And blessing those who came. In the bower of Mary the Maiden There's a high seat and a low, And the white-robed serving maidens Are moving to and fro. With dishes of gold and silver The banquet they prepare, And the scent of myrrh and roses Is filling the air. With white wine and with red wine The brimming gourds o'erflow; And the Mother sits on the high seat, And the Maid on the seat below. When the virgins have wash'd and anointed The weariful Mother's feet, When over her head they have broken A box of ointments sweet; When her mouth of the food hath eaten, And her lips have touched the wine, She looketh on Mary the Maiden, And dryeth her tear-wet eyne. ‘On thee and thine, my daughter, All peace and blessings be! The God of Israël bless thee For thy sweet charitie!’ As fair as the Hûleh lily That blooms in the summer beam, Was Mary the Maiden, wearing Her robe of the silken seam; And on her hair and her bosom Were jewels and gems of price, And round her neck there was hanging A charm with a strange device: A heart of amber, and round it Ruby and emerald bands, And over it, wrought in crystal, Two little wingèd hands! White and warm was her bosom That rose and fell below, And light on her face was playing, Deep, like the after-glow; With the waves of her heaving bosom That strange light went and came, Now dim and dark with the shadow of earth, Now flush'd with a heavenly flame; And the warmth of the glad green meadows, The scent of the Night and the Day, Flow'd up from Mary the Maiden To Mary the old and grey. ‘O wherefore, my namesake Mary, Art thou so good to me,— The woeful woman who wedded With Joseph of Galilee? ‘Poor is my lot and lowly, Sad is my heart and sore,— I am not worthy, my daughter, To enter thy palace door!’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, The beautiful shining one, Answer'd, ‘I love thee, Mother, For the Rabbi's sake, thy Son! ‘To the fairest and best of mortals Thy womb hath given birth,— Like the moon on the troubled waters He walketh the waves of Earth! ‘White as a statue of marble Wrought in some Grecian land, Fair as a palm-tree growing Green, 'mid the desert sand, ‘Monarch of men he shineth Bright as the morning star, A God, and of Godhead fashion'd, Not mortal as others are! ‘There's a storm in my snow-white bosom Only his touch can still,— There's a void in my heart, O Mother, Only his love can fill!’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Bent down and kissed her brow: ‘God help thee, Mary, my daughter, And all such maids as thou! ‘His love is not for the things of earth, His blessing for things of clay,— A voice from a Land beyond the grave Is calling my Son away! ‘How should he stoop to a love like thine Who hath no love for me? In my womb he grew, from my womb he fell, And I nurst him on my knee.’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Smiled through her night-black hair,— ‘I met his eyes as he passed this day, And methought he found me fair! ‘There is never a man of the sons of men Who would not smile on me, But if thy Son is more than a man, Alack for me and thee! ‘But if thy Son is Joseph's son, E'en as his brethren be, Why, I am Mary of Magdala! And a King might mate with me.’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Answered again, and said: ‘The love of the world is not for him, Nor the happy bridal bed! ‘He has cast away all women of earth Even as he casts out me,— In my womb he grew, from my womb he fell, And I nurst him on my knee.’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Frown'd, answering scornfullie— ‘Nay, rather than be another's bride I would his leman be. ‘Rather than mate with Herod the King Or Cæsar himself, his lord, I'd be thy Son's, and ask no more Than a kindly look or word. ‘I'd make my bed across his feet, I'd be his handmaiden,— There is no other lord for me 'Mong all the sons of men. ‘Yea, though thy Son be Joseph's son, Who toileth for his bread, For one warm kiss of his rosy mouth Gladly I'd die,’ she said. 'Twas Mary the Mother answer'd: ‘Thy woe is even as mine; Fain would I see my Son stoop down To a human love like thine. ‘Hast thou not heard, O Mary, The wondering people say “He is Moses or Eli risen again, Or a greater even than they”? ‘Hast thou not heard them whisper low Who follow him night and day— “The seed within his mother's womb Came from no human clay”? ‘Hast thou not heard that, ere I wed My husband leal and true, My womb was full of a wondrous life That quicken'd ere I knew; ‘And how my mate was wroth and thought To thrust me from his side, And how an angel in the night Came to his bed and cried: ‘Forbear to know the woman thy wife, Yet put her not away, She is quick with child of the Holy Ghost, And hath known no man of clay; ‘Behold it was written long ago, Ere thy life's thread was spun, “A Virgin shall conceive of God, Quicken, and bear a Son!”’ It was the dark-eyed Mary Sprang up her height and cried: ‘Is this thing true, and is thy Son He that was prophesied?’ 'Twas Mary, the Mother, raised her hands, And wept and tore her hair,— ‘Woe worth the day that I was born, Or ever a child did bear! ‘Hearken to me, my daughter, Sit down and hearken to me; But breathe not, out in the world of men, The thing I tell to thee. ‘For the sands of my life run low, And the thread of my woe is out-worn, And the Lord hath smitten the Mother down By the hand of her eldest-born. ‘'Twas but a little hand When my babe lay here at rest, A weak little hand, like a rose-leaf, That felt for my milky breast. ‘Hearken to me, my daughter, And when my tale is done, We'll kneel in the night together And pray for the man my Son!’ Green leaf and blossom, White flower and red, The whole world is gladdening Where Love's feet tread! There's light in the morning, There's life for the young, 'Tis then the songs of Eden On every bough are sung! The young maid is listening, Her lover by her side,— Heaven the earth encircles, The bridegroom his bride. Green leaf and blossom, White flower and red,— The whole world is gladdening Where Love's feet tread! ‘The God of Israël passeth From world to world on high, The seas and the mighty mountains Quake as He passeth by; ‘No eye hath looked upon Him, No soul hath fathom'd His ways, His face is veil'd, though His breathing Filleth our nights and days; ‘His Hand is a Hand in the darkness, His Voice is a Voice in the gloom, But seed of Jehovah hath never Been sown in a woman's womb. ‘Yet the Light that blindeth the vision Comes from the worlds He made, And fire of the flesh He fashion'd Maketh the soul afraid. ‘I wander'd happy and lonely By wood and meadow and stream, And the joy of my youth was upon me And twined me away in a dream. ‘And my love's voice said “Thou art fairest, Thine eyes are the eyes of the dove, Thy breasts are roses and lilies,” And I heark'd to the voice of my love! ‘Yea, the joy of my life was upon me, And the light of my youth in my eyes, And a breath like the breath of the morning Woke me in Paradise! ‘By the beautiful waters of Marah We pitch'd our tent in the sun, And we drank of the waters rejoicing, And lo! our dreaming was done; ‘For the taste of the waters was bitter, And the bright sun shone no more, And I sat alone in the gloaming, And the day of my dream was o'er; ‘Then I rose in my sorrow, casting Ashes and dust on my head, For the seal of my womb was broken, And the flower of my youth had fled. ‘Yet no one wist of the wonder As home to our house I came, Only the God of our fathers Knew of His daughter's shame. ‘And I dwelt in the house of my people And veil'd my face like a maid, But ever when men came wooing I fled to my chamber and prayed. ‘Morning and eve to the fountain, Between the night and the day, I went with the village maidens Bearing my pitcher of clay. And a man from a neighbouring village Saw me, and thought me fair, And lo! when I journeyed homeward, I found him waiting there; ‘And while he spake with my father His eyes grew large on me; And the man was stately and gentle, With a voice like the sough of the sea. ‘And my father gave me unto him, With goats and kine for a dower, And I fled to my lonely chamber And wept for many an hour. ‘For the eye of my God was upon me While I wept and sorrow'd apart, And a little hand in the darkness Was lifting the latch of my heart! ‘Would I had died in the night-time, Would I had ne'er been born,— I feared the eyes of the bridegroom, And sorrow'd from night till morn. ‘Then came the hour of the bridal, The feast and the bridal song,— O, weak is the heart of a woman, But the Law and the Lord are strong! ‘As he bare me home to his dwelling 'Twas summer in all the land, But my heart was broken within me By the touch of that little hand. ‘As we stood in the bridal chamber He offered me bread and wine, And I feared the light of his loving As his eyes grew large on mine; ‘And I fell at his feet, and weeping Pour'd out the gourd of my shame, And the wrath of the Lord around him Like fire-flaught went and came! ‘And at first he hunger'd in anger To thrust me beyond his door, But the mercy of God came on him Though his soul was stricken sore. ‘And at last, when his wrath was over, His face grew gentle and mild, And he spake as a gentle father Might speak to an erring child. ‘O blessings upon the bridegroom Who shielded his bride from wrong— The heart of a woman is feeble, But the strength of a man is strong! ‘The mighty God of our fathers Bless him in life or death,— Wisest and best of mortals Was Joseph of Nazareth! ‘He shielded me in my sorrow, He calm'd my spirit to rest, He found the sheep that had wander'd And warm'd it on his breast. ‘And when my travail was over, And the night of the birth-pang done, He lifted the Babe from my bosom And said, “Behold our Son!” ‘Yea, over the babe and the mother The balm of his love he poured, And he named the new-born JESUS Which meaneth “Sent by the Lord.” ‘And I clave to my mate and master, The tenderest man among men, Yea, I grew to his breast in gladness, His wife and his handmaiden! ‘And after my cleansing he knew me, Yea, gave me the bridegroom's embrace, And children were born unto us To gladden our dwelling-place.’ 'Twas Mary, the grey-hair'd Mother, Bowed down her woeful head; 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Reach'd up her arms and said: ‘God's grace and blessing, Mother, Wrap thee from head to feet! The ways of the world are weary, But the kiss of a mouth is sweet! ‘Now tell me who was the lover Who brought thee such glad pain? Some mighty lord of the City? Some chief of the lonely plain?’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Moan'd to herself and said: ‘His name will never be utter'd, Darkness hideth his head! ‘He is gone like the dew of the morning, He is fled with the flowers of the May, His name on the sands of the desert Was written and blown away. ‘I clave to my lord and master, And peace and joy were mine, For the blissful milk of the mother Flow'd in my breast like wine; ‘For the lips of my babe drew from me The poison and the pain, Till the weariful heart within me Gladden'd and leapt again! ‘A maid's love, O my daughter, Is a pearl that men may buy, But the love of a new-made mother Is a rainbow in the sky! ‘All peace of earth and of heaven Are gather'd in her embrace— Smiling the little one lieth And looketh up in her face! ‘His lips are lilies and roses, His scent is sweeter than myrrh, He draweth bliss from her bosom And breatheth it back to her! ‘Still as a star on my bosom My little first-born lay, And like a fountain around him My love flow'd day by day! ‘Clear as the summer heavens I saw his blue eyes shine! Never on mortal bosom Shone babe so bright as mine! ‘The days flow'd on like a murmuring brook That gladdeneth in the sun,— For I heard the music of earth and heaven From the mouth of my little one! ‘Brighter and fairer my first-born grew, And O, but it was sweet To hold him up with a finger touch When he stood upon his feet; ‘I could hold him up with a finger touch, He was so light and frail,— But now he hath the might of a man How should my strength avail? ‘Yet even in those sweet far-off days, So bright and now so dim, Meseem'd the bairns his playfellows Were different from him! ‘He seem'd not as other children That play in the summer beam,— With the sound of their mirth around him He stood and look'd up in a dream! ‘And while from hillock to hillock They flew with laugh and cry, He watch'd the white clouds passing Over the still blue sky! ‘So grave and yet so gentle, So still and yet so blest,— It seemed some fountain of wonder Flow'd in his baby breast. ‘And one by one in the darkness The new-born waken'd and cried, And I gladden'd, a fruitful Mother, Forgiven and purified! ‘For lo! he gladden'd among them, The fairest and goodliest, And still that fountain of wonder Flow'd in his gentle breast! ‘And so he grew in the dwelling And brighten'd from day to day. And the Light of the Lord was on us, And the Angels looked our way!’ There's a cry of little ones in the bield, And a patter of feet on the floor; The Sun is splashing o'er farm and field To the golden pool at the door! The earth is twining flowers in her hair, And there's some for you and me; Smile, Babe!—leap, Babe!—rock'd upon Mother's knee! Of all the joys that the years can bring There is never a joy like this,— Flowers to bloom, birds to sing, And the bud of a mouth to kiss! Our good-man looks smiling on, And a proud good-man is he! Smile, Babe!—leap, Babe!—happy on Mother's knee; Clear as a fountain by our fireside The cry of the young is heard, Answer'd over the whole world wide By the cry of lamb and bird! It's home-time now in the happy world And it's Heaven with my bairns and me! Smile, Babe!—leap, Babe!—rock'd upon Mother's knee! Round and around our house they run, A laughing, barefoot band— Bright at the door the merry Sun With a golden nod doth stand! And it's oh! for the peace of Heaven and Home, And the light on my bairns and me! Smile, Babe!—leap, Babe!—happy on Mother's knee! As the flower of the Hûleh lily Shineth after the rain, The face of Mary the Mother Smiled, and grew bright again! For the milk of the glad young mother Seem'd flowing in her breast, And once again to her nipples A little mouth seem'd prest; And her great grey eyes half closing Were dim with the happy dew, And her red lips trembled and open'd As the quick glad breath came thro'! ‘The peace of God was upon me, The smile of God at my door, My soul was a summer fountain That filleth and floweth o'er! ‘Fairer and fairer my first-born grew Till he was seven years old, And his eyes had the glint o' the waters blue And his hair the sunset's gold. ‘His voice was low as the voice o' the dove That cries in a shady place, And the light of a love that was more than love Flowed from his shining face; ‘For he loved all things that the Lord hath made Who maketh great and small, And he folded his little hands and prayed That God might guard them all! ‘But ever of all God's creatures He loved the weak things best,— The lamb that leaps in the meadows Would come and lie in his breast; ‘The doves that dwell on the house-tops Would gather about his feet, And the hungry dogs would lick his hands As he walk'd i' the sun-scorch'd street! ‘And he loved the folk who were sick and weak, Whom God had stricken sore, Yea, the tears would roll adown his cheek For pity of the poor; ‘And sad was the heart of my little one, And his eyes grew wet and dim, When the spotted lepers crawl'd i' the sun And held out hands to him! . . . ‘In the synagogue of his fathers He heard the Rabbis preach, And better than play or pleasure He loved their stately speech; ‘Yea, even as the wild bee gathers Its honey from flower to flower, He gathered the words of wisdom For many a happy hour. ‘But best he loved (God bless him, And cherish him night and day) The wandering men of the desert Who silently fast and pray. ‘For when from the holy places One of these wights footsore, With scoop of brass, and apron Of linen, would pass our door, ‘My good-man, merrily toiling Within at the carpenter's board, Would bid the pilgrim enter And rest, in the name of the Lord; ‘And when he had made ablution He'd enter and bless the place, The silence of God around him, The light of God on his face; ‘And Jesus would gaze upon him, Till he reach'd out hands and smiled, And murmur'd, “The God of Jacob Preserve the little child!” ‘Then silently like a shadow He'd rise and wander away, But the Light of God and His Silence Would dwell on the child all day. ‘Oft, as he spelt his letters, Resting the scroll on my knee, He'd close the scroll in his little hand And sigh, and question me— ‘And 'twas “O, mother,” and “why, mother, Do mortals weary and die? Surely our Father in Heaven Heareth His children cry?” ‘The tales that a thousand mothers Tell to their sons, I told,— Of the chosen race of Israël And the weariful days of old; ‘And how in the land of bondage We wail'd beneath God's hand, Till the prophet came to set us free And we gain'd the Golden Land; ‘Dumbly he'd stand and listen While I those tales did tell, And o'er and o'er he'd have me sing The psalms of Israël! ‘O sweet he was as the summer rain That falleth on desert ways, But ever the cry of human pain Troubled his nights and days! ‘And 'twas “O, mother,” and “why, mother, Are folks so weary and sad? The sick folk die, and the lepers cry, Though the sun shines bright and glad!” ‘And he'd stand and muse apart Like an old man bent with years, And the well of wonder within his heart Fill'd, like an eye with tears! ‘And so my little one grew, The whitest lamb in the fold, But the shadow dwelt in his eyes of blue And his ways were strange and old. . . . ‘We came to the Holy City, And the streets were bright and gay, And lo! from the hour my bairn was born 'Twas thirteen years and a day. ‘The Temple stood with its gates of gold On the heights of Jerusalem, And the children gather'd like lambs i' the fold And the Elders question'd them; ‘And we missed the child in the holy place, And wondering, sought for him, And lo! he stood with a shining face In the halls of the Sanhedrim! ‘And the Priests and Rabbis gathered round, And smooth'd their beards and smiled, To hear the words of wisdom sound From the lips of a little child. ‘Proud and glad was my heart that day For joy of the little one! And blithe and merry we rode away When the Holy Feast was done! . . . ‘Stronger and fairer my first-born grew And in our bield he stayed, For now he toil'd at the bench and knew My good-man's gentle trade! ‘And his voice chimed cheerily all day long To the chime of the busy plane, And as I sat and heark'd to his song My heart was glad again! ‘For methought “My shame hath passed away, My Son grows strong and tall,— The God of Israël be his stay Wherever his feet may fall! ‘“The God of Israël grant him life And be his light and guide,— And when he taketh a maid to wife May their seed be multiplied! ‘“May their days be long in a fruitful land Under the summer skies, And ere I sleep may he hold my hand And close my happy eyes.” ‘O the light o' the Lord shone bright indeed Upon our dwelling-place! For methought my seed was a goodly seed To quicken and grow apace! ‘And I saw my Son's seed multiply And gladden from day to day, And I heard my children's children cry Like voices far away! ‘The life of man is a tale thrice told, His joy is a flower full blown— When our Son was nineteen summers old, He toil'd at the bench alone! ‘The weight of years on his hair so grey, The sleep-dust in his eyne, My good-man Joseph passed away While I held his hand in mine; ‘Gently he beckon'd the first-born near And gazed in his face and said: “O, Jesus, look to thy mother dear When I lie cold and dead!” ‘'Twas darkness then in the lowly bield For many and many a day; For he who had been my strength and shield Was taken and hid away. ‘My children gathered around my knee And I bowed my widow'd head, But gently my first-born smiled on me And my grief was comforted. ‘O, blessed be the name of the Lord! He taketh and giveth again, His wrath is fire and a flaming sword, But His love is summer rain; ‘The flesh of the stricken He healeth up, The sick He maketh sound,— When our grief is full as a brimming cup He poureth it on the ground. ‘The peace of God on my spirit fell For joy of the man my Son,— At his father's board he wrought full well Till his daily task was done. ‘There was never a man of woman born Was half so fair as he,— Like the sound of a fountain night and morn Was the voice of my Son to me. ‘And evermore when his toil was o'er He loved to wander away, To comfort the sick and cheer the poor, Or to muse apart and pray. ‘And in the synagogue he'd teach Among the Rabbis old, And he gather'd wisdom, and lo! his speech Grew stranger twentyfold; ‘But ever I murmur'd day and night, “Never was Son like mine; O, may his days be long and bright, And his flesh a fruitful vine.” ‘Out of the lonely desert Preaching Jochanan came, And stood in the shallows of Jordan Naming the one God's Name. ‘Wild as the horse of the desert No man may saddle and ride, Over his naked shoulders A cloak o' the camel's hide; ‘He cried aloud to the people Who gather'd on the strand: “Repent! repent; for the Kingdom Of Heaven is close at hand!” ‘And men and women and children, From morn to evenfall, Flock'd to the Prophet's bidding And he baptised them all;— ‘With water he baptised them Under the open sky, And lo! on the second morning The man, my Son, stood nigh! ‘And lo! as they met together The eyes of John were dim, For as morning star unto evening star Was the man, my Son, to him! ‘Yet with water he baptised him, And lo! when it was done. The hunger and thirst of Godhead Grew in the soul of my Son; ‘And he wandered away from the people Into a desert place, And there alone with the Silence He fasted and hid his face; ‘And the stars of Heaven beheld him, And the wild beasts hovered near, But the eye of man did not see him And the ear of man did not hear; ‘And he ate not and he drank not, But fasted and prayed, and so The flesh on his bones was wasted, And the light of his life burnt low. ‘And when I again beheld him I trembled and sobbed aloud, For the dews of Death were upon him And his face seem'd set in a shroud! ‘“O where hast thou been, my Jesus, And why is thy look so wild?” He stood like a ghost in the doorway And look'd in my face and smiled; ‘And his smile was loving and gentle, Tho' his face was ashen grey, But his eyes were gazing through me At something far away! ‘“O where hast thou been, my Jesus, And what didst thou hear and see?’ “I heard the winds of the night,” he said, “And the Silence spake to me!” ‘“Alas and alas, my Jesus, And what didst thou see and hear?” “I saw the Dead in their shrouds pass by And the Souls of the Dead stood near! ‘“And I heard the beasts of the desert Moaning like human things, And the Spirit of Darkness cover'd my head And wrapt me 'neath his wings. ‘“But I knelt and prayed that my Father in heaven Would shrive me of my sin, And the Gates of Heaven swung open wide To show the lights within; ‘“And a Face looked out of the Golden Gates, And the Spirit of Darkness fled, And the Hand of God like a Father's hand Was placed upon my head. ‘“And the Voice of God, like a Father's voice, Came down the dark to me,— ‘Go forth, go forth in thy Father's Name, For He hath chosen thee.’” ‘“Alas, and alas, my Jesus, What didst thou see and hear? The words thou speakest are dark and strange And fill my soul with fear. ‘“The Master of Earth and Heaven Hath neither feet nor hands,— The wind of His breath is as the blast That bloweth the desert sands. ‘“His face no eye hath looked on, His voice no ear hath heard,— And yet His face is the Light o' Life, And His voice is a wingèd Word.” ‘Sadly he gazed upon me, With great eyes dim with pain, And the face of my Son burn'd bright through tears, Like a rainbow through the rain. ‘“Come in and rest, my Jesus, Thy spirit is weary and worn, Come in and sleep in thy father's house Where thou, my child, wast born; ‘“And I, thy mother, will sit beside Thy bed, and sing to thee The song I sang when I sang and rock'd Thy cradle with my knee.” ‘Sadly he gazed upon me, Folding his hands in prayer,— “My Father's house is wide as the world, And high as the heavens up there. ‘“My Father's house is wide as the world, And I was born therein,— My Father calleth me out of Heaven To cleanse it of its sin. ‘“Never again shall my Father's Son Rest in a narrow bed,— To and fro, and up and down, His weariful feet must tread. ‘“Never again shall my Father's Son Hark to thy cradle song,— To and fro, and up and down, He goes, for the way is long.” ‘“Hearken to me, my Jesus, Stay, and hearken to me; Thy sisters and brethren who sit within Would break their bread with thee. ‘“Come in, come in, and sit at the board, Where my first-born should be, And I, thy mother, will wash thy feet, And stand and wait on thee!” ‘Sadly he gazed upon me, Frowning he turned away,— “Who break with me the Bread of Life, My sisters and brethren are they! ‘“No brethren dwell in my Father's house Save those who eat His Bread, No mother's love can save the quick Or wake and shrive the dead! ‘“And woe is me for my brethren dear Who o'er the wide world stray, And woe is me for the witless love That withereth in a day! ‘“Lo, there be beds in my Father's house Many as waves o' the sea,— From bed to bed my feet must pass Till the sleepers wakened be! ‘“Lo! there be boards in my Father's house Where men feast merrily,— From board to board my feet must pass Till all shall follow Me!” ‘He turn'd away with a weary moan From the bield where he was born, And as he wander'd from door to door His townsfolk laughed in scorn! ‘For strange he seemed as a witless wight Whose soul and sense are dim, And his eyes were bright with a vacant light And the children mock'd at him! ‘We followed him slowly as up the street Slowly he went his way, And we saw him enter the synagogue, For 'twas the Sabbath day; ‘And silently he enter'd in And stood in the midst o' the crowd, And his head was raised as they named the Name, Tho' all the rest were bowed! ‘And he took the scroll in his thin white hand While the Elders gather'd round, And he read the lesson, and named the Name, And sat down to expound; ‘The first words that he utter'd there Were gentle and soft and low, And the sound of his voice was as the sound Of a fountain's ebb and flow; ‘The next words that he utter'd there Were wild and strange and loud, And the sound of his voice was as the sound Of the riven thunder-cloud; ‘The next words that he utter'd there Were drown'd in fierce acclaim, For the Elders rose and tore their beards And the folk shriek'd out in shame! ‘Around my Son like an angry sea They gather'd shrieking shrill, And his face was calm as a patient star And his pale lips murmur'd still: ‘Again he utter'd the Name of Names Nor knelt on bended knee, But his eyes looked up as if they saw The Face no man may see. ‘With curses and blows they thrust him forth Into the open street, And spectral pale he stood at the door Like a corpse in his winding sheet. ‘“Come home, come home, my Jesus, Come home with me,” I cried, And gently I sought to guide him home, But he pushed my hand aside. ‘“No home have I but my Father's Home, And thither my feet must fare,— My Father's Home is as wide as the world, And high as the heavens up there.”’ Thou shalt not see, thou shalt not hear, Yet I, the Lord thy God, am near. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt not see, Yet I, thy God, abide with thee. My Spirit stirs around thee (saith The Lord), thy nostrils drink my breath. So near am I both night and day, And yet my throne is worlds away. Seek not to unveil or fathom Me,— But shut thine eyes, and bend thy knee. Juggle not with the Law Divine, Nor seek my Heavens for a sign. I am veil'd for ever, I am dumb, And yet my thunders go and come. Father and Lord I am indeed, And yet have neither Son nor seed. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt not see, Yet I, thy God, abide with thee. Let it suffice thee that I reign,— Beware to take my Name in vain. Go then thy ways,—though I am near, Thou shalt not see, thou shalt not hear. It was Mary, the woeful Mother, Cried, weeping bitterlie, ‘My days are dark, for the Lord my God Hath taken my Son from me! ‘He walked by the lonely waters, And saw the ships go by, And he cried aloud, and the men o' the ships Heard, and answer'd his cry! ‘And the sound of his voice could still the pain In the hearts of the tempest-blown, For he spoke of the waters no ship may gain And the land no man hath known! ‘And the men o' the sea forsook their nets And, gathering one by one, Sat by the waters of Galilee And heark'd to the man, my Son. ‘And his voice was soft as the rain That falleth cool on the grass, And his face was like the moon in the sky That watches the Tempest pass! ‘And the souls of the men o' the sea Close to my Son did creep, And he reached out hands and counted them As a Shepherd counteth his sheep! ‘Alone I bode in the lonely house And his blessing reached not me,— I heard his voice like a sea-bird's cry Far out on a sunless sea! ‘And the elders flocking about our house Cried, “Woe to him and thee! The mad folk gather to hear thy Son And his mouth speaks blasphemy! ‘“He prophesieth and raveth loud Out there by Galilee, With woven hands and with magic spells He lures the men o' the sea! ‘“He eateth and drinketh unpurified, He breaketh the Sabbath day: He is Eli or Moses risen, he saith, Or a greater even than they!” ‘Nay then, the words they spake were sore For a mother's ear to hear, And I cried: “He is holy and pure of heart, And such to the Lord are dear! ‘“Fair as a lily-flower, my Son Hath grown to the height of man— Ah, never yet grew a flower so fair On earth, since the earth began!” ‘Yet ever the wonderful rumour grew, And men began to tell Of mighty magic in secret wrought Wherever my Son's foot fell: ‘How the lame man walked, and the blind man saw, And the dumb man spake and heard, How the waxen man laid out for dead Had bitten his shroud and stirred! ‘Nay then, my heart was sick with fear And I feared for the man, my Son, For I wist such wonders are often wrought By will of the Evil One! ‘“He casteth down Devils by Beelzebub, Who is Prince of Devils,” they said, And I turn'd my face to the wall, and cast Ashes and dust on my head. ‘For my buried shame had risen again And haunted my soul forlorn, As I prayed for the soul of the man, my Son, Even Jesus my first-born. ‘Suddenly through the streets o' the town I heard the laugh and the cry, And follow'd by throngs of stranger folk Jesus, my Son, went by. ‘And those who follow'd were ragged and poor, And many were gaunt and gray, And I cried his name as he passed our door But his face was turned away. ‘And the townsfolk mock'd him as he walked Swiftly from street to street, But when he came to the edge o' the town He shook the dust from his feet. ‘“Never was Prophet honoured yet By those of his own countrie,— Woe to the town where I was born And the folk who mock at me!” ‘And he wandered up and over the hills, And his feet were swift as wind, And I join'd the throng o' the sick and poor That crept and crawl'd behind; ‘And down to the shore of the lonely Sea Of Galilee he came, And the throngs of woeful women and men Gather'd and called his name.’ It was Mary, the gentle Mother, To Mary the Maiden cried,— ‘Like waves o’ the sea, the people Flow'd on the mountain side; ‘And even as a rock in the waters The man, my Son, stood there, And the light of the still blue Heaven Slept on his golden hair. ‘When he reached out hands and bless'd them, They were hush'd as waves o' the sea, And their faces were dark with yearning As they listen'd on bended knee: ‘For his voice was sweet as a fountain Or the voice of the turtle dove, As he told of a Heavenly Kingdom And the love that is more than love; ‘And the burden of earth was uplifted By the touch of a magic hand, And the folk beheld as they hearkened The gleam of the Promised Land: ‘A land of milk and of honey, Golden and bright and blest, Where the wicked would cease from troubling And the weary would be at rest! ‘Then the peace of God flowed round me And the days of my woe seemed done, As I listened happy and smiling, To the voice of the man, my Son! ‘Kind were his words and gentle, Bright was his face and mild,— Happy he seem'd and loving As when he was a child! ‘“Come to me, ye who hunger, Come, and be straightway fed! For lo! I bring from the Father Not ashes and dust, but bread! ‘“Come to me, ye who are weeping, And all your tears shall cease, For lo! I bring from the Father, Not trouble and pain, but peace! ‘“Come to me, ye who are stricken, Who sicken and fight for breath, For lo! I bring from the Father Eternal Life, not Death!” ‘Sweet as a fountain's falling The music filled our ears: “Your Father in Heaven loves you And fain would dry your tears! ‘“Your loving Father in Heaven Heareth his children's cries— Let him who is sick, then, gladden, Let him who hath fallen rise!” ‘And the wind of his words went swiftly Over the wondering crowd, And like waves of the sea uprising They wept and they sob'd aloud! ‘Then one shriek'd loudly, “Rabbi! Heal me, lest I die!” And lo! with a thousand voices They echo'd that woeful cry! ‘Ragged, and worn, and weary They gathered under the skies,— And the blind men groped unto him Rolling their sightless eyes! ‘And the little afflicted children Close to his knees upcrept, But the lepers stood afar off And reach'd out hands and wept! ‘Pale as a man of marble He stood on the lone hillside, And wept as he gazed upon them, And lifted up hands and cried: ‘“The Light I bring from the Father Shineth in secret ways,— Only the Hand that smiteth And slayeth, hath power to raise! ‘“And yet the sick shall be healèd, And the blind shall surely see, For my Father's door is open To those who follow me! ‘“Weep not, but be of comfort! Fret not, your woes shall cease! For lo! I bring from the Father Love, and exceeding Pcace!” ‘But still they gather'd and murmur'd With piteous woes and cries: And the blind cried, “Master, heal us!” Rolling their sightless eyes! ‘But e'en as they flock'd around him And reached out hands and cried, He girded up his raiment And passed from the mountain side. ‘Swift through the clamouring people He walked, nor gazed on them, While they thronged to look upon him And to touch his raiment-hem; ‘And the blind folk groped in the sunlight, And the sick folk wept in woe, And the lepers gazed from afar off And wail'd, as they watched him go!’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Reach'd out her hands and cried: ‘These things thou sawest, O Mother, These things and nought beside? ‘Was not the sick man healèd? Did not the blind man see? Such wonders were wrought, 'tis rumour'd, Out yonder by Galilee!’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Answer'd in soul's despair,— ‘Woe worth the day that I was born Or ever a Son did bear! ‘How shall the hand of a mortal Give back what God hath ta'en— If the hand of a man could dry our tears No man would weep again! ‘The sick would sicken no longer, The blind would gladden and see,— But man is dust, and what God hath bound No man that is dust shall free! . . . ‘When darkness over the mountain Fell, for the day was done,— Silently down the mountain side I followed the man, my Son; ‘And I found him standing alone, On the shore of a stormy sea,— With hair and raiment backward blown He prayed, and he marked not me; ‘And his hands were raised to the sky Where the angry storm-clouds drave, “Father, Father,” I heard him cry, “Stretch down thy hand and save! ‘“That the blind may see, that the sick be heal'd, That my word may wake the Dead!” And the storm roll'd on, and the thunders peal'd, And the lightning flash'd and fled. ‘“Father, Father, if I indeed Thy dread commandments keep, Help me to heal the hearts that bleed, To dry the eyes that weep. ‘“Wearily over the whole world wide My stricken brethren lie;— Father in Heaven, look down,” he cried, “Succour them, since they die!” ‘And lo! he fell on his face and prayed Alone on the lone sea-shore, And I watch'd him, trembling and afraid, Till he stirred and rose once more. ‘And, lo! the storm of the night had fled, Softly the night-wind blew, And the clouds were opened overhead, And the stars were shining through. ‘And the light, like a hand snow-white, Lay on his golden hair, As he walked on the shore at the dead o' night And found me waiting there. ‘Face to face in the silence We stood by the sleeping sea,— “Woman,” he said, “what brings thee here, And wherefore seekest thou Me?” ‘Then my heart broke in my bosom, And I sank on my bended knee,— “I am Mary, thy Mother, and all night long My tears have flowed for thee. ‘“I heard thy voice on the mountain side Sweet as the wood-dove's cry, And the doors of Heaven seemed opening wide And the Spirit of God went by!” ‘Gently he gazed upon me As I knelt upon my knee,— “God bless thee, Mary, my Mother, Dost thou believe on Me? ‘“I have prayed, and my prayer is answer'd, I have wept, but my tears are done, My Father in Heaven hath heard my prayer, And, lo! we twain are One. ‘“Even as the love of the Father The love of the Son shall be; Even with hands of the Father The Son shall set men free. ‘“Greater than I is the Father, And yet we twain are One!” Weeping I rose to my feet and gazed In the face of the man, my Son. ‘“Alas, alas, my Jesus! Thy riddle is hard to read,— The God of Israël dwelleth afar, And hath neither Son nor seed! ‘“No eye of a mortal fathom can The waters of Death and Doom,— Seed art thou of a mortal man, And grew in thy mother's womb! ‘“Come home, come home, my Jesus, And dwell in peace with me— The Lord is the Lord of Heaven and Hell, Thy mother hath only thee.” ‘Sadly he gazed upon me, Frowning he turn'd away, “Woe to thee, woman of little faith, In the dawn of my Judgment Day! ‘“I have no brethren, I have no mother, Save those who believe on Me! Son of my Father am I, and no other Judgeth the lost, and thee!” ‘Sadly he gazed upon me With eyes all woe-begone, Full of the hunger of Godhead That gleam'd in the eyes of John! ‘But when I clutched at his raiment, He wept and turned from me, And passed on shipboard, and sailed away With the wild-eyed men o' the sea; ‘And his voice rang out once more From the deck of the ship, and lo! The sick and blind flocked down to the shore, And wail'd as they watch'd him go! ‘And swiftly into the Night He flew, as a sea-bird flies, And the lepers gathered upon the height, And wail'd to the empty skies.’ The Leper said: ‘Lord God, if Thou art just, Heap earth upon my head, Bury me, dust to dust! I did not crave to be, Yet lo, I crawl i' the sun, And if Thou healest not me, Slay me and set me free— So let Thy Will be done!’ The Blind Man said: ‘Lord God, I seek the Light— Wherever my cold feet tread, 'Tis night, eternal night. Darkly I've sought for Thee, Dear Lord, since life begun, But since I still must be, God, give me eyes to see— So let Thy Will be done!’ The Mad Man said: ‘Lord God, uplift Thy hand! Demons and spectres dread Fill me at Thy command! I loathe Thy works and Thee, O Thou Almighty One, I did not crave to be— Slay me, or set me free, So let Thy Will be done!’ God said: ‘Peace! for your cry is vain,— I weave of quick and dead An ever lengthening chain. Peace! from my Law and Me No man escapeth,—none,— Long as the earth and sea Endure, these things shall be,— For so My Will is done!’ 'Twas Mary, the gentle Mother, Listen'd with lips apart, While the voice from the lonely mountain Flow'd thro' her empty heart. ‘Fairer he is and gentler Than other mortals be, But his thoughts are yonder in Heaven, Not here on the earth with me. ‘I would to God he were lying A babe on my breast this day,— The light of his eyes is the light o' love, But it shineth so far away! ‘I hear a voice still crying Aloud to the sons of men, But the cry of the babe on my bosom Will never be heard again! ‘Rabbi the people call him, Rabbi and Master and King; He breaketh bread on the mountain, While I sit famishing!’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Gazed from the bower and said: ‘He healeth the spots of the Leper, He raiseth up the Dead! ‘And lo! as he passeth the gateway With ragged throngs behind, Out of the lanes are crawling The sick and the halt and the blind; ‘E'en as a King of the people He passeth on his way, And whoso toucheth his raiment-hem Is straightway healed, they say! ‘Their bread he multiplieth, He turneth their water to wine— Surely this Man, O Mother, Is more than flesh of thine?’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Bowed down her head and cried,— ‘The God of Israël bless him From morn to eventide! ‘Flesh of my flesh, O Mary, Bone of my bone, is he,— In my womb he grew, from my womb he fell, And I nursed him on my knee. ‘From place to place he passeth, Stately and tall, like one Who walketh on thrones to his kingdom, And yet . . . he is my Son! ‘Gladly my soul would greet him Though he were thricefold King, But ever behind him as he walks The Shadow is following! ‘Man is a spark in the darkness, His days are only a breath, The wings of the Lord are wide as the world And the shadow thereof is Death.’ 'Twas Mary, the grey-haired Mother, Rose trembling on her feet— ‘The ways of the world are many, But yonder, all ways meet! ‘The wings of the Lord are mighty And shadow all things that be,— I hear their sounds in the silence Deep as the sound of the Sea. ‘The heart of the Temple is cloven, The high-priest waileth aloud, The wrath of the Lord is growing, Black as the thunder-cloud. ‘The rose and the Hûleh lily Bloom but a little space,— After his day man sleepeth, Alone in a lonely place. ‘Never the dead that sleepeth Shall slip his shroud and rise— His ears are sealèd for ever, Darkness filleth his eyes.’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Stood at the gate and cried: ‘O, hark! they hail him as sent of God, Promised and prophesied!’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Stood up and tore her hair: ‘Woe worth the day that I was born Or ever a son did bear. ‘The God of Israël crieth “There is no God save Me!” The Elders of Israël gather in wrath Like waves of a stormy sea.’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Gazed from the gate and cried: ‘Thy Son shall wear a crown on his head, Yea, and a sword at his side. ‘The people cry he is Lord and King, Tho' he be Son of thine,— O would that I were the Queen o' the King, Or even his concubine! ‘There is never a man of the sons of men Who is half so fair as he,— Be he seed of a mortal or son of God, He is Master of men and me.’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Sank to her knees and said: ‘Look forth, look forth, and tell me now Whither my Son's feet tread?’ 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, Laughed merrily, answering: ‘His face is turned to Jerusalem, And there they will crown him King. ‘Be he seed of a mortal or son of God, The folk will crown him there.’ 'Twas Mary the Mother shrieked aloud, And wept and tore her hair! ‘I hear a Voice he cannot hear, That crieth “Forbear! forbear!” I see a Hand he cannot see That holdeth a sword in the air! ‘The Elders of Israël gather in wrath Like waves of a stormy sea! The God of Israël crieth aloud, “There is no God but me!” ‘The God of Israël crieth aloud As He to our fathers cried— “The soul of a man is the breath of a mouth, But I, the Lord, abide!”’ The Lord and the Law are One And nought can sunder them! Wherever their swift feet run The worlds rock under them! Wherever the Lord hath pass'd The Law fulfilleth Him, E'en Death lies low at last, For a mightier stilleth him! One, the Law and the Lord, That passes and interpasses Sure, as the sweep of a sword, Still, as the growth of the grasses! Two, yet ever the same, Life and Death for their token— The Lord that hath no name, And the Law ne'er broken! No miracles come of these Whose miracles are for ever, Their mystery no man sees, It is uttered never. Life and Death and Birth Betoken their ministration, On the Earth, and over the Earth, And through all Creation. The Law and the Lord are One, And nought can sunder them! Wherever their Will is done, All things bow under them! Think not with prayer or praise, When the grave gapes wide for thee, To stop the sun on its ways Or turn God aside for thee! He is Lord to the furthest sun, With His strength He thrilleth him, But the Law and the Lord are One, And His Work fulfilleth Him! As they parted His raiment among them, For His vesture casting lots, On the clouds of the night burnt brands of light Like crimson leper-spots; But the storm of the night was over And the wild winds ceased to cry, Yea, all was still on the skull-shaped hill As the Spirit of Death crept by. 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Lay prone beneath the Tree, And Mary the Maid knelt down and prayed With Mary of Bethany. And the light came out of the skies And struck the Cross on the hill . . . And Jesus moaned and open'd His eyes, And the heart of the world stood still! On His head the thorny crown, His body bleeding and bare, He woke on the Cross, and gazing down Beheld His Mother there! And ‘Mother! Mother dear!’ He murmured smiling sweet,— And Mary arose, and creeping near Sobbed, and embraced His feet. And ‘Mother! Mother dear!’ Softly He sighed again, And over His wounds, as she sobbed to hear, Her wild tears ran like rain! Not to His Father in Heaven, Not to the empty skies,— To Mary the Mother He looked, and no other Blest, with His dying eyes. The love of the Lord of Heaven Is a dream that passeth by, But the love of a mortal Mother Is a love that doth not die! The sword of the Lord of Heaven Husheth His children's cry, But the love of a mortal Mother Shines on, tho' God goes by! Gently He gazed upon her Who had loved Him last and first,— Then darken'd again with the cruel pain, And murmur'd low, ‘I thirst!’ As they set the sponge on a spear And moisten'd His mouth, He said, Smiling down on His mother dear, ‘Lo, it is finishèd!’ And He bowed His head on His breast And utter'd a woeful cry, And the weariful Mother's lips were prest To His wounds,—while God went by! Twas Mary, the happy Mother, Smiled and knelt on her knee, And bared her breast and opened her arms As they drew Him down from the Tree. She pillow'd His head on her bare breastbone And gave Him kisses three— ‘In my womb he grew, from my womb he fell, God giveth him back to me!’ And over the cold still waxen face Rain'd down her locks o' grey, And the heavens were black, but the gates of Heaven Were opening far away; And the birth-star looked from the gates o' Death As she rock'd the corse on her knee, And the Earth lay silently down to watch In the still bright arms o' the Sea. On the breast of Mary the Mother He rock'd beneath the Tree, And Mary the Maiden sat at His feet With Mary of Bethany; And, lo! they croon'd His cradle-song As she rock'd Him on her knee,— There was Mary the Mother, and Mary the Maiden, And Mary of Bethany. 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Wept as she sang, and cried: ‘My little one sleeps upon my breast, For, lo! 'tis the eventide. ‘And round and round my cold breastbone I feel the white milk stir!’ And she wept aloud, and the Maries twain Wept, and drew close to her. ‘Now dry thine eyes, O Mother dear, Smile and be comforted,— Thy Son doth sleep, but thy Son shall wake To judge both Quick and Dead. ‘Thy Son hath promised to wake again, And the folk shall bring his crown,— The clay thou nursest is not thy Son, But thy Son is looking down.’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Pressed tight her mouth to His: ‘My Son is sleeping upon my breast, And his red, red mouth I kiss. ‘By the milk that stirreth around my heart I know my little one; By the flesh that was woven in my womb I know The flesh and the bone of my Son. ‘I hold him now, I clasp him now, He is mine for evermore, For the sun hath sunken upon his wrath, And the day of his Dream is o'er. ‘Never more will he open his eyes To waken and weep! Never more will the wind and the rain Trouble his sleep! ‘The heart of the Temple is cloven, The High Priest teareth his hair, But God is good, He giveth me back The fruit that my womb did bear! ‘Yea, God is good, for my Son is mine To cherish and clasp and keep,— And I too, holding him in my arms, Shall croon myself to sleep!’ 'Twas Mary, the bright-eyed Maiden, Rose up her height and cried: ‘The womb of the night is cloven with light! He liveth, and hath not died! ‘He liveth, Lord and Master of men, And he shall rise and reign! For man is dust, and the hand of a man Smiteth at God in vain!’ Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Raised up her face and cried: ‘Go by! the seal of thy God lies here On the lids of the Crucified! ‘Go by, for I loved my child too well To bid him waken and weep— My God is good, and the hand of God Giveth my little one sleep!’ 'Twas Mary of Bethany weeping cried, ‘Hush, for I hear a tread! They're coming hither over the hill To seek and bury the dead; ‘And one uplifteth a torch on high To light them as they go, And they who follow are bearing a shroud Of linen white as snow!’ And now they've embalm'd His white bodie With myrrh and spices sweet, And round and round they've lapt the folds Of the long, long winding sheet; And they've bound up tight His bearded chin With waesome linen bands, And over His frozen breast they've spread His yellow waxen hands; And they've borne Him up to the black hillside To His lonesome Sepulchre, And they've set Him down in the narrow place, And still He doth not stir . . . . ‘Now come away, thou woeful woman, And leave him sleeping alone, Let us close the mouth of his Sepulchre And seal it with a stone!’ 'Twas Mary the Mother kissed His cheeks And sobbed in soul's despair,— And the torchlight lay like a bloody hand Upon her poor grey hair. And from over the hill the stars looked down With dim sad tearful eyes, For the cry of the Mother's broken heart Rang through the empty skies. (It rang to the foot of the Throne of God Where all the wide world's woe, The dole of a million broken hearts, Melts like a flake of snow.) 'Twas Mary the Maiden weeping cried: ‘Come forth, O Mother dear!’ 'Twas Mary the Mother answered, ‘Nay! Go thou and leave me here! ‘Go forth, go forth, and on your head All peace and blessing be, But leave me here with the little Son I nurst upon my knee! ‘There's room here at thy side, my Son, There's room here with thee, And O! to hold thee in my arms Is more than Heaven to me! ‘And thou shalt sleep, and calm as thine My own deep sleep shall be! For ever and for evermore I'll rest, my Son, with thee!’ They have led her forth from the lonesome place, Despite her woeful moan, They have closed the mouth of the Sepulchre And sealed it with a stone; And down the hill to Jerusalem They pass, but leave the three— There is Mary the Mother, and Mary the Maiden, And Mary of Bethany. 'Twas Mary, the dark-eyed Maiden, First dried her weeping eyes: ‘O Mother dear, we will keep watch here, For lo! he will arise! ‘Master and Lord of men was he, And he will wake again,— Yea, ere he died he prophesied That he would rise and reign! ‘He is not dead, but only sleeps, And soon shall rule again— O Mother dear, we'll keep watch here, Till he doth rise and reign!’ 'Twas Mary the Mother answered not, But sat like a frozen thing, Her dim dark eyes on the door o' the Tomb, Vacant and famishing. The first night they sat waiting there The great Deep thunder'd loud, And the lightning Snakes crept in and out Their soot-black caves of cloud; The next night they sat waiting there Came Silence strange and chill, And the stars hung watching out of heaven. And the heart o' the world stood still; The third night they sat waiting there The winds began to cry, And a cold snow fell from the frozen stars, And the Spirit of Death went by! 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Rose to her feet and said: ‘The gate of the Tomb is sealèd fast, And the Light of the world hath fled. ‘Never again shall the man, my Son, Brighten the night or the day— The soul of a man is the breath of a mouth, And lo! it passeth away! ‘And it's O! for the kiss of his mouth, And the touch of his hand,—aye me! My day is dark, for the Lord my God Hath taken my child from me! ‘And it's O! for his long, long sleep, Alone in a lonely place,— My Son is dead, for the wrath of the Lord Hath fallen and hidden his face. ‘O had ye left me lying there, At his side or at his feet, In peace, in peace like a fount that falls, My heart had ceased to beat!’ Then Mary, the gentle Maiden, Answer'd her cry and said: ‘Wait on, wait yet, for a heavenly sign That our Lord is quick, not dead!’ 'Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Stood up and rent her hair: ‘Woe worth the day that I was born Or ever a son did bear! ‘How shall the hand of a mortal Gather the sheaves of the Lord? The hand of a man is ashes and dust, God's hand is fire and a sword! ‘How shall the seed of a woman Master Euroclydon? A woman's seed is as thistlebloom, And lo, with a breath 'tis gone! ‘My son was fair as a lily, His hair was of golden sheen, But the lilies of Sharon perish When the winds of the Lord blow keen! ‘What man shall stand in the whirlwind Where only the Lord may stand? The feet of the Lord are on the Dead, And the Quick blow round like sand!’ Twas Mary, the woeful Mother, Crept down from Calvary, Held up by Mary the Maiden And Mary of Bethany; And over the hill the Dawn'd bright feet Plash'd in the Night's cold springs, And a lark rose, shaking the drops o' pearl From the tips of his dewy wings; And the heart of the world throb'd deep and strong As on Creation's Day, And the skies that roof the happy earth Were as blue and as far away! Shepherd dear, the winds blow cold, 'Tis dark, so dark, on the wintry wold,— Waken and gather thy flocks to fold! Over the stormy hills they roam, Feebly crying they go and come, With never a Shepherd to help them home. Shepherd dear, ere the day was done, Around thy feet in the summer sun They flock'd, and were counted one by one; Thy white hands blest them, Shepherd dear, And thy voice said sweetly: ‘Be of cheer! The fold is open, and I am here.’ Now, alas! the light hath fled, The heavens are starless over head,— We listen still for thy voice, thy tread. So cold, so still, this wintertide, Thou sleepest, who wast once their guide,— Thy crook lies broken at thy side. The cold snow falls, the shrill winds cry, The flocks are scatter'd, they droop and die, And there's never a star in the wintry sky. Alas! thou dost not see or hear! In the frozen sheepfold, Shepherd dear, Thou sleepest on, while we weep in fear. Shepherd, Shepherd, the winds blow cold! 'Tis dark, so dark, on the wintry wold,— Waken, and gather thy flocks to fold. AD MADONNAM. I. If I could worship in these Shrines at all, Methinks that 'twould be yonder, where I see The Holy Mother fair and virginal Holding the radiant Child upon her knee: For Rome, eternal foe of all things free, Still quick tho' stretch'd out cold 'neath Peter's pall, By this one gift of grace redeems her fall And makes amends to poor Humanity. Madonna, pure as mortal mothers are, Type of them all, for ever calm and good, Over thy Son thou shinest like a star While at thy milky breasts His mouth finds food . . . Holiest and best of all things, holier far Than Godhead, is eternal Motherhood! II. Nineteen sad centuries have passed away, Madonna, since this Man thy Son was slain, Since pillow'd on thy breast thy dead Child lay Nor heard thy moan of deep despair and pain: So long! and all earth's tears have fallen in vain Upon the grave that covereth that sweet clay— Thou, too, didst cease to watch and plead and pray, And slept at last never to wake again. Best of all living creatures, thou alone Whom God Himself had chosen (saith the Screed!) Thou, Virgin of the Lily, must have known If He, thy Son, was Son of God indeed; Yet thou ('tis written) didst that claim disown, Denying godhead to this Man, thy Seed! III. ‘His Mother and His Brethren stood without And waited!’ Ah, poor Mother, full of tears While men believed and gladden'd, thou couldst doubt And to that cry of godhead close thine ears! Thro' the dark cloud of those forgotten years I hear thee moaning yet, ring'd round about With maniac faces, while the madmen shout And high 'gainst Heaven the crimson Cross appears. Mother of God! and yet thou couldst deny In thine excess of love the Godlike claim! Chosen of God,—yet thy despairing cry Rose up to God in passionate grief and shame, While, wraptinkingly robes thy Son went by, Nor answer'd when thy lips did breathe His name! IV. His face was raised to Heaven, not turn'd to thee, While thou didst call Him back from that mad quest; Taught by thy Mother's heart, thine eyes could see The piteous end of His divine unrest. . . . Ah, well, God heard thy cry, and on thy breast Again He sleeping lay, and thou and He, United at God's feet, eternally Abide in peace, of all things last and best. . . . And yet, God knows! We know not! Wherefore, then, The weary strife, the fret that ceaseth never, Wherefore the witless want which maddeneth men, The cruel sleepless quest, the long endeavour, If, having waken'd once, we sleep again, And lose our heritage of Love for ever? V. Our heritage of Love! . . Life and not Death, Light and not Night, we seek from age to age; The Spirit Thou hast kindled with Thy breath To serve thee, Lord of Life, demands its wage! Amid Thy tempests that for ever rage, Man at Thy conjuration travaileth: ‘I did not crave to be, O God!’ (he saith) ‘But since I am, give me my heritage! What Thou hast quicken'd, what Thy power hath taught To serve Thee through all moods of doubt and fear,— The mystic mood that flashes back Thy Thought, The love that seeks Thy Heaven, and finds it here,— These are Thy works, and what Thy hand hath wrought Claims service still, from sleepless year to year!’ VI. And yet, alas, the ways of God are dark, His purpose hid, His will a mystery,— No sign or voice that man may see or hark Hath ever broke His Law's Eternity. A little space we strive, then cease to be, A day we smile, and then lie stiff and stark, Forgotten 'neath the dust with none to mark, Silent, Madonna, like thy Son and thee! God gave no answer to our Brother's prayer, The empty Heavens echoed back His cry; He fainted 'neath the load we all must bear That bitter day they led Him forth to die,— ‘Father,’ He cried, in darkness and despair, And drank the cup no hand hath yet put by! VII. Gentle and loving was this Man, thy Seed, And innocent as any lamb at play, For all the woes of man His heart did bleed, Yea, till the wrath of God made dark His day, Till with the whole world's woe His soul grew gray, As radiant as the morning was His creed: To heal the sick, to succour folk in need, To bless the poor and wipe their tears away . . . Then groping darkly, maddening in His place, Vainly He sought to grasp what none may find,— For never tongue can speak or eye may trace The Mystery God keeps dark from humankind, And he who seeks to front God face to face Is, by that Sun of Wonder, stricken blind! VIII. And lo! the issue! Of that loving Word Thy dear one spoke, a multitudinous moan! Not peace thy Son hath sent us, but a Sword Shapen cross-wise, that flames from zone to zone! And still the weary generations groan, And still the vials of God's wrath are poured On innocent and guilty, and the Lord Veileth the very footstool of His Throne! And unto every man, as to thy Son, Cometh, at last, the same dark dread and doom— All that our hands have wrought, our prayers have won, Endeth with Him in utterness of gloom, Our brief day endeth, and our Dream is done, And lo! the woven shroud, the opening tomb! IX. Patient Madonna, with the heavenly eyes Not upward bent, but downward on thy Child,— Within thy open arms is Paradise Happy and innocent and undefiled! Smile thus, as many a mother sweet hath smiled, Forgetful of that Shadow in the skies,— Hushing the whole world's woe, and all the wild Tumult of Nature, in thine Infant's cries; And there, beneath that ever-loving gaze, Eternal Child, find peace and calm at last! Deaf to Thy passion, heedless of Thy praise, God dwelt afar off in the empty Vast, But Thou returnedst, after many days, Unto the Heaven whence Thy feet had passed! I. And O Madonna mine! O dear grey-hair'd Mother, of human mothers first and best, All that my soul hath sought, my dream hath dared, All that my youth and hope thought good-liest Depart, and leave me crying for thy breast! A child again, I see thy bosom bared, And, lo! I falter to the place prepared Where, after life's long fever, I may rest! This gift alone, when the long day is done, I ask from Him who holds all gifts in store— After the weary battle, lost or won, To find thy love and blessing as before, To be again thy little helpless son, And feel thy dear arms round me evermore! II. Thou sleepest, Dear!—and yet a little space I stir above thee, waiting for a sign: Colder than coldest marble is thy face, Shut are thine eyes, I cannot see them shine; But thou wilt waken! and thine arms will twine Around me in the dark and narrow place Where thou art lying, and again God's grace And blessing will be on us, Mother mine! My hair is grey like yours, my faltering feet Are weary, and my heart grows chill and cold, Faint is the prayer my feeble lips repeat, Sad is the soul that once was bright and bold, But when at last thou wakenest, smiling sweet, I'll be thy child again, not worn and old. A CATECHISM. What is thy name? Robert Buchanan. Who Gave thee that name? Those from whose seed I grew, He from whose loins I sprang, she in whose warm Womb I grew shapen into flesh and form,— Whereby I first did crawl, then walked upright A child, inheritor of Life and Light. What did thy Father and Mother then for thee? Three things they swore: firstly, to shelter me From all things evil, teaching me to find, Through love for them, due love for all Mankind; Next, that through that first faith, made ripe and good Through human motherhood and fatherhood, My soul should learn to apprehend and know The Parentage Divine whence all things flow; Lastly, that, walking all my nights and days In love and reverence, I should learn God's ways And His commandments. These things in my name, They promised and fulfill'd, until I came To full estate of all Life's joys and woes; And as the measure of my love for those Who first made Earth a happy dwelling-place, And ring'd me round with offices of grace, So may my love for all things measured be Now and for ever, through Eternity. Dost thou still think that thou art bound in right To keep those pledges? Yea, and morn and night I keep them; if I stumble unawares, The fault is on my head, and not on theirs Who hold me dear for ever in their sight, And turn'd my face to Heaven, to feel the Light. Rehearse the articles of thy belief. I do believe in God, supreme and chief Of all things, first and last;—whose works proclaim His glory, and the glories of His name; I do believe in all the gods that shine Beneath Him, humanised for eyes like mine To images of loveliness divine; I do believe that through my Father in Heaven My sins (if Sin could be) would be forgiven, And that, though Death for ever passes by, Whate'er hath come to life can never die. Thou saidst ‘If Sin could be’? If Sin be blent Into my nature as its element, Then 'tis my God's as surely as 'tis mine; But since I know my Father is Divine, I know that all which seemeth Sin in me Is but an image and a mystery. Who is the God of Earth and Sea and Sky All-living and all-knowing? He is I; Impersonal in all that seems to be, He first and last grew personal in me; His inward essence shines behind these eyes; His outer form in all they recognise. Hath He no Being, then, apart from thee? None. Yet abideth through Eternity? As I abide. Yet is He Lord of Death? Yea, and if I should perish, perisheth. Is He not more than thou? He is the Whole Of which I am the part, yet this my Soul Is He, and surely through this sight of mine He sees Himself and knows Himself Divine. Now, name His attributes? They have but one name,— Love, which embracing all things grows the same As that it contemplates. Lov'st thou the Lord? Nay; tho' I bow before His will and word. How doth He manifest Himself? In me, And in mine other self, Humanity. Name the Commandments! Ten. Thou shalt have one God, and one only (may His will be done!) Thou shalt not fashion graven images Of Him, or any other, and to these Give prayer or praise; nor shall thy faith be priced By any priest of Christ or Antichrist, In any Temple or in any Fane; Thou shalt not take the Name of God in vain. All days shalt thou keep holy, pure and blest, Six shalt thou labour, on the seventh rest, But every day shall as a Sabbath be Of heavenly hope and love and charity. Honour thy father and thy mother,—not That God may lengthen and make bright thy lot, But that the love thou bearest them may spring Fountain-like to refresh each living thing Which lives and loves like thee. Slay not at all,— Neither to feed thy wrath, nor at the call Of nations lusting in accursèd strife, Nor to appease the Law's black lust for life; But take the murderer by the hand, and bring Pity and mercy for his comforting. Tho' thou must never an Adulterer be, Deem not the deed of kind Adultery, But reverence that function which keeps fair The Earth, the Sea, the Ether, and the Air, And peopling countless worlds with lives like thine, Maketh all Nature fruitful and divine; For as thou dost despise thy flesh and frame Shalt thou despise the Lord thro' whom they came, And if one act of these thou deemest base Thou spittest in the Fountain of all Grace. Thou shalt not steal, nor any lie sustain Against thy neighbour; covet not his gain, His wife, or aught that's his to have and hold, For robbing him, thou rob'st thyself tenfold! What dost thou learn from these Commandments? Love For things around me, and for things above Worship and reverence; hate of deeds that sin Against the living God who dwells within This Temple of my life; obedience To that celestial Light which issues thence. Swearest thou to renounce, reject, and shun The Flesh and all the lusts thereof? Not one; For these are of the godhead, which is I, And if this Flesh could pass, this Soul must die. Shall not the Flesh dissolve and disappear? Shall not this Body which surrounds thee here Pass into nothingness? Never, since 'tis made Of God's own substance, which can never fade. Dost thou believe in Jesus Christ, God's Son? In Him, and in my Brethren every one: The child of Mary who was crucified, The gods of Hellas fair and radianteyed, Brahm, Balder, Guatama, and Mahomet, All who have pledged their gains to pay my debt Of sorrows,—all who through this world of dream Breathe mystery and ecstasy supreme; The greater and the less: the wise, the good, Inheritors of Nature's godlike mood; In these I do believe eternally, Knowing them deathless, like the God in me. How many sacraments hath God ordained Whereby the strength of man may be sustained? None; since all sacraments in Man are blent, And I myself am daily sacrament. Dost thou not realise that, being base, Thou art lost for ever, if no saving grace Were sent in pity out of yonder sky? Dost thou not know that, answering man's cry For help and aid, thy God who is Divine Put on a human likeness such as thine,— Knew all thy doubts and fears, was foully slain, Died, rose a space, and shall arise again? Death cannot touch the Lord my God. I know That in a dream of death long years ago Mine Elder Brother beautiful and fair Inherited life's sorrow and despair, And being weary of the garish day Died, blessing me. He hath not passed away, But filling all the world with His sweet breath Walks, watch'd by two pale Angels, Sleep and Death. Dost thou not in thine inmost heart believe, Despite the lies which faithless sophists weave, In Holy Church? All Churches, great or small! But most, that roof'd with blue celestial, And fairer far than Temples built by hands, Which, while all others fall, survives and stands! More, I believe in Hell, and hope for Heaven! Yea, also, that my fears may be forgiven, And that this Body shall arise again To Light and Everlasting Life. Amen. ANTIPHONES. I. The Love of God. How can I love Thee, God that madest me? Who saith he loves Thee, lies! Behold him, mouthing on his bended knee, Upgazing to the skies! Thy works, Thy wonders, Thine Omnipotence? Shall these awake my love? Nay, these are only phantoms of the sense Whereby I live and move! Thy mercies and Thy gifts?—Thy large delight In making living things? Love is not born of any token bright Imperial Nature brings. I love my fellow men, I love this hound Who gently licks my hand, I love the land around me, and the sound Of children in the land. But Thee? I love not Thee!—Stoop down, come near To me whom Thou hast made, Then I may know Thee close, and hold Thee dear,— But now I shrink afraid. There's never a helpless thing surrounding me, No timid bird or beast, I love not better far, O God, than Thee, Tho's Thou be first, these least. I love the maid I woo, the mother whose touch I feel upon my brow, The friend who grips my hand!—for these are such As I, and not as Thou. Thou Vision of my Thought! Thou Mystery Of which men preach and rave! I would not look, if Heaven held only Thee, One foot beyond the grave! I seek the gentle ones who once were near, Not Thee, O light above,— I crave for all who learn'd to love me here And whom I learn'd to love! Out of Thy Darkness to this Light I came, Thro' whim or wish of Thine, O Miracle! O God unknown! O Name Eternal and Divine! And since Thy Glory fills these nights and days That are so fugitive, I give Thee thanks, O God, I give Thee praise, But love I cannot give! II. Contra Christum. No Mediator, none! If thou art God, Thy torments were self-wrought; If thou wast Man, despised and undertrod, Thy sorrows teach me nought. I look within and find my Godhead there, Not yonder on the Cross! Sharer of my soul's doubt, my heart's despair, My daily gain and loss, How shouldst thou mediate for me and mine Who art thyself not free? If thou thyself wast deathless and Divine, What part hast thou with me? If thou art but the Son, and like the rest Fell slain before God's Throne, Then will I love thee (lo! my hand is prest, Dear Comrade, in thine own!) But if thou art the Father in disguise, I snatch my hand away— Back to thy realm, back to thy silent skies,— I'll wait thy Judgment Day! I search within, I find my one God still. What answereth He? ‘Had I Been God all-Powerful, fashioning to my will All things that creep or fly, ‘I had not built their glory or their gain On endless suffering, I had not blent my Godhead with the pain Of any living thing.’ Can the all-Powerful be all-Pitiful? The all-Cruel be all-Kind? If this be so then thou, my God, art null, Then thou, my Soul, art blind! No Mediator, then! Soul of my Soul, God of my Thought, rest free: Sure of myself while the long ages roll, I turn in peace to Thee. III. My Enemy. Like to a Leper clings this man to me, I strike at him in vain! My soul is haunted by mine enemy In endless forms of pain. I would forget him, turning in delight To those my soul holds dear. I cannot. Like my shadow, day and night, Mine enemy is here. My very being, blighted with his breath, Droops like a thing forlorn, Yea, with his presence, dim and dread as Death, My living force is worn. I scorn him as the dust beneath my feet, I curse him loud or low— God hears me yonder on His Judgment Seat, And yet he doth not go. Yea, even more firmly than the first and best Of mortals loved by me, Clingeth with fierce hands on my wounded breast, This man, mine enemy! Sometimes, when fiercely struggling throat to throat, Like snakes that intertwine, Our eyes meet, and within his eyes I note An agony like mine. Sometimes, when God doth beckon from His skies And bids me climb or soar, I see great tear-drops in the hated eyes That mock me ever more. And now I know that neither I nor he Can ever part at all,— If I arise, I lift mine cnemy, And if he falls, I fall! Nay, then, we two must down or upward move With the like end and aim,— The links of Hate are as the links of Love, Nay (Nature saith) the same! The same? Nay then, I hold mine enemy Too near for hate or scorn, For what I hate in him is born of me,— Like his own hate, self-born. At last I pray for him, and praying know That he and I are one,— United at God's feet we fall, and lo! Our foolish strife is done! IV. Resurrection. Scorner of Flesh, thou who wouldst plunge in gloom This radiant thing God made, What shall abide if this should cease to bloom, This Flesh Divine should fade? The Soul? A Flower of which this Flesh is seed? Nay, Flesh and Soul are one! Thou who wouldst part this one in twain, take heed, Lest all should be undone! This eye of Flesh, to see and apprehend, Is thy Soul's eye! This clay, That adumbrates thy Soul, shall find no end Till that, too, fades away! Lo, lying with a lily in her hand, Thy dear one slumbereth,— Yet on a day she shall arise and stand Smiling on vanquish'd Death. All Flesh, all Form, all that was pure and fair Here on Life's crowded road, She shall arise,—nay, not one little hair Shall pass away, saith God! All that was beautiful, all thine eyes and sense Saw beautiful and whole, The Form, the Flesh, no part shall vanish hence, Since these things are the Soul! Nought that is beautiful can die,—no form That once grew fair can fade,— This flesh shall still be radiant, sweet, and warm, Form of the soul God made! From the unconscious to the conscious life Man hath emerged, to know Self-knowledge, Sight, victorious o'er the strife Of Nature's ebb and flow. The day God can divide this life in twain Its length of day is done, But both, be sure, will rise and live again, If Flesh and Soul are one! V. Nature. Nought is so sure as this, that Nature strives Reckless of human pain, That on the hecatomb of slaughtered lives She looks with large disdain. Canst thou appease her hunger? For a space, But surely not for long;— She strews Life's Deep with wreckage of our race, For she alone is strong. Behind her footsteps crawl Calamity, Sorrow, Disease, and Death! And yet she shareth in the agony Of these, who are her breath. Gladsome and beautiful, divinely fair, Eager to blight or bless, She carries in her heart all life's despair, Yet still is pitiless. How then escape her? Summon to thine aid Thy God, all gods that be,— Inexorable, silent, undismayed, She smiles on them and thee. Fringe of her raiment, dewdrops on her feet, Gleams of her own surmise, Thy Gods go with her, fading as they meet The flashing of her eyes. Dying yet deathless, changeful yet unchanged, Still here, though all are gone, All Love, all Hate, avenging and avenged, She passeth slowly on. Yet be of comfort,—let her wend her way! Watch as she goeth by! The power which slayeth all things cannot slay Herself,—who cannot die; And thou, my soul, art deathless, being part Of her who is Divine,— Pulse of that great and ever-beating Heart, Its length of life is thine! Destroying all things, she destroyeth nought (Wherefore, be comforted!) For if her life could fail within thy thought, She would herself be dead! L'ENVOI. Think not that I blaspheme Because I worship not this God of thine; Because I bend not, either in deed or dream, To that dread Force Divine. Atheist thou callest me, ?????, he who stands apart from God, While priests and poets name Him fearfully And tremble at His nod! Poets and priests have lied From immemorial Time, and still they lie; Close to the ground they watch, dull-soul'd, dull-eyed, The Lord of Hosts go by! Not thus in far-off days The Titan stood, fronting the stars and sun— Erect he watch'd, with neither prayer nor praise, The inevitable One! ?????, too, was he Who everywhere the Soul of Pity saw— The God he prayed to, yonder in Galilee, Was not your God of Law! He dream'd as atheists do Of love that triumphs on, tho' undertrod; He worshipt not the gloomy God o' the Jew, Nor even Nature's God! The Law, the Might, the Lord, Won not the worship of the Crucified,— Murmuring another name, a gentler word, The last Great Dreamer died. Alas, he could not heal The woes of Nature, or subdue her strife,— But in sublime revolt he made men feel The piteousness of Life! . . . It is not reverence To kneel in Temples priests and slaves upraise: The Law which sweeps us hither and sweeps us hence Heeds not our prayer or praise. It is not blasphemy To front, Prometheus-like, Eternal Fate! The God to whom your priests now bend the knee Left Jesus desolate! So died he, ?????, Seeking in vain to break the Tyrant's rod; Tormented, like Prometheus, on his Cross, By all the slaves of God! The New Rome. (1900.) PROEM. TO DAVID IN HEAVEN. THIRTY YEARS AFTER. David Gray. See the Prologue to the author's ‘Undertones,’ Lo! the pale Moon roaming Thro' the autumn gloaming, Walking yonder Heavens alone, as many a year ago! Lo! the dark streets under, Hush'd their voice of thunder, Silenced their mighty streams of life, and still'd their wails of woe! Lo! Night's benediction Shed on all things sleeping,— The round still Moon above,—beneath, the River silently creeping! Do I dream, or waken? . . . On mine eyelids shaken Falls the silver dew that shuts so many weary eyes; Sleeping not, I wander 'Neath the Moon, and ponder, A dream that wanders in a dream, a soul that sings and sighs— Sorrow clingeth to me,— Time hath overcome me,— Sorrow and Time pursue in vain the friend who was taken from me! Pale with dead ambition Comes his Apparition! Light of life, my boyhood's friend, so beautiful and fair!— Here in the night he lingers, Creeps close, with clay-cold fingers Touches my feverish aching brow, and softly smooths my hair: My heart breaks within me, My tears fall, and I name him— The soul alive with love and light, till the darkness overcame him. In the City that slew him My spirit hungereth to him, Fain would clasp him close, but lo! he fadeth and is gone! Lone and weary-hearted I think of days departed, The shining hope, the golden lure, that led our footsteps on! That led me even hither To Night and isolation, That crowns me with the weary crown of a sunless aspiration! Is it gone for ever, The bright young endeavour, Hope that sang among the stars, and Joy that drank the day? Has the deeply cherish'd Aspiration perish'd, And is the Dream we dream'd of old for ever fled away? By the strife scarce ended, By the battle bravèd, Whisper a magic word to-night, from the grave where I left you, David! Help me,—I am failing! So sad, so unavailing, Seem these weary waiting years, to your long years of rest! Yours the sweeter sorrow,— To strive not night or morrow, But tranquilly to sleep and dream, as on your mother's breast! Winter stealeth on me, The snow-time cometh nigh me,— Aye me! the Spring, when I was young, and sang, and my friend was by me! When we trod together Yonder land of heather, Poets gladden'd in the world, divinely dower'd and born— Now, the few remaining, Sad souls westward waning, Walk sighing and look backward to the darken'd gates of Morn! Dead Gods sadly beckon, Godlike Poets follow,— The hooting of the owl is heard in the Temples of Apollo! What, then, shall awaken Souls of men forsaken By the Poets, by the Gods, by Hope and Faith and Song? Teach me, ere I wander Through the shadows yonder, One word of comfort and of joy, to make my spirit strong! Ah, your voice is silent, Like those greater voices,— Gone is the glory of the Dawn, and the music that rejoices! All I sang and sought for, Agonised and fought for, In my hand is faëry gold, these wan and withered leaves Wherefore still importune Fame or fickle Fortune? Ah, wherefore chase the Naked Shape that beckons and deceives? All I plead and pray for Is one glimpse of Maytime,— The light of Morning on the fields of the flower-time and the paly-time! How should Fame avail me, If you and God should fail me, Light of life, my boyhood's friend, who left me long ago? Empty now, full measure, O Fortune, all thy treasure— Tis but a heap of withered flowers, and never a seed to sow! All I plead and pray for, Be it night-time or day-time, Is one red bud of living bloom from the rose-trees of the Maytime! Here, alone and weary, I hear man's miserere Sound from Temples where the Gods stand frozen into stone; Loud the world complaineth, But never a Bard remaineth To stand upon the mountain-tops and trumpet mortals on! 'Tis over, all is over! The world lies bereaven Of Time's young dream, of Love's bright lure, of the Hierarchies of Heaven! Love me, David, love me! From thy place above me Send me strength to stand erect, in Life's great Hippodrome! The mob shrieks ‘Ad leones!’ And on the Imperial throne is Christ with the crown of Antichrist, lord of another Rome: His legions shriek around him, His creatures deify him, But naked in the ring I wait, while the harlot Fame sits by him. ‘Loosen the wild beasts!’ Hither Springs Hate, and Falsehood with her, Fateful, cruel, leonine, they crouch and gaze at me! How shall arms avail me When all the horde assail me, And foulest, spotted like a snake, the leopard, Calumny! Alone in the arena, Strewn with dead and dying, I look into their eyes and wait, while the horde is multiplying! Love me, David, love me! Stay and bend above me! Light of life, my boyhood's friend, there's still no love like thine! See! I raise in token This sword blood-red and broken, And point at yonder scarlet thing, the Fame we deemed divine: The imperial Harlot rises, Her cold dead eyes look thro' me, With shrill clear voice she crieth ‘On!’ and pointeth the wild beasts to me! 'Tis over!—all the splendid Dream of joy hath ended! Fame is Death, and Death is Fame,—and Death is victor here! Once, in days departed, Dying happy-hearted I could have borne the martyr's doom,—but now I shrink in fear. No Heaven opens o'er me, I hear no heavenly voices! Gone is the faith which fights or falls, when the heart of youth rejoices! This we learn, who linger Beneath Time's wither'd finger,— In a little while we cease, and all our dream is o'er; Youth's fair morning vision Of God and life Elysian Is but a foolish fantasy, a childish dream no more; This the wise have taught us Every weary morrow: That all the Glory and the Dream are the rainbows of our Sorrow!— Better cease as you did! Star-eyed, divinely-mooded, Hoping, dreaming, passioning, fronting the fiery East! Better die in gladness, Than watch in utter sadness The lights of Heaven put slowly out, like candles at a feast! You emerge victorious, We remain bereaven: Better to die than live the heirs of an empty Earth and Heaven! Stay! and whisper to me Comfort to renew me— Say the broken Gods survive, say the dead Bards live yet! Tell me the Immortals, Past the grave's dark portals, Remember all the melodies that we on earth forget! That, gathering grace together, Gods and Poets wander In shining raiment, side by side, thro' a Land of Light up yonder! Say, the upward-springing Heirs of noble singing Fill the starry thrones and keep their heritage supreme— Swiftly sunward flying Byron still is crying, Wordsworth along the calm blue aisles walks in his gentle dream! Shakespeare, grave and gracious, Reads some scroll of wonder; Keats watches Homer's blind blue eyes, while the gods sweep past in thunder! . . . Ah, the dream, the fancy! No power, no necromancy, Peoples Heaven's thrones again or stirs the poet-throng! Nought can bring unto me You who loved and knew me, The boy's belief, the morning-red, the May-time and the Song— Faintly up above me Winter bells ring warning— Aye me! the Spring, when we were young, at the golden gates of Morning! THE NEW ROME. (Kensington Gardens. Late evening.) THE POET. Declaiming from a Manuscript.) ‘“The time is out of joint. O cursed spite That ever I was born to set it right!” Yet forth I'll venture, leaping in the lists, To join the knightly band of Satirists! For since the hour—’ A VOICE. Proceed! I'm listening! Prithee, remember I am always near When Bards who ought to soar to Heaven and sing Elect to crawl upon the ground and sneer! THE POET. Satan again! THE NEW-COMER. I see you recognise me! The real and only Devil, whose cause dejected You champion'd 'gainst a world that vilifies me, See ‘The Devil's Case, passim And so for Hell's black laurel were selected! Yea, Satan! Not the gruesome De'il invented Up north by Kings and ministers demented, Not the Arch-Knave in bonnet and cock's feather Who scaled the Brocken peaks in windy weather, Far less that fop of fashionable flummery Beloved by Miss Corelli and Montgomery:— Nay, the true Æon, friend of things created Whom 'tis your glory to have vindicated! THE POET. What brings you hither? THE ÆON. Partly to remind you Of sundry noble themes well worth your while, My son, to sing of,—but alas, I find you, Putting this joyful Jubilee behind you, A-swing on Twickenham's too easy Style! 'Ware satire, friend! and most of all, I pray you, Shun jogtrot jingles of the pinchbeck Masters! THE POET. And if my Muse refuses to obey you? THE ÆON. Be damn'd with Austin and the poetasters! But come, your subject? THE POET. Rome!—the new-created And dominant realm which now makes jubilation! This Empire, which is Rome rejuvenated! THE ÆON. Continue, if you please, your declamation! THE POET. ‘Yet since the hour when in the throat of Wrong The Roman thrust his blunt-edged sword of song, Since as a tigress suckling cubs unclean The Imperial City fed its fiefs with sin, Full circle round the Wheel of Time hath rolled, And lo! another Rome, like Rome of old, Heir of the ages, gathering hour by hour The aftermath of human pride and power, Pitiless as its prototype of yore, Sweeps on with conquering sails from shore to shore! As Rome was then, when all the gods were dead, When Faith was gone, and even Hope had fled, Yet when the Roman still in every land Knelt and upraised to Heaven a blood-red hand, So is our England now!—yea here as there, Temples still rise and millions kneel in prayer— Pale gods of Peace are carelessly adored, While priests and augurs consecrate the Sword! “Honour the Gods!” the people cry who know Those gods were dead and buried long ago: Atheists in thought and orthodox in deed Men throng the forum and uphold the Creed, For fashion still preserves what Truth hath slain, Still simulacra of the gods remain, And still 'tis decent, 'spite the scoffer's sneer, To keep the word of promise to the ear And break it—to the Soul!’ THE ÆON. Bravo! a strain Which makes the little hunchback squeak again! Proceed! THE POET. You're laughing! THE ÆON. As you say! THE POET. Doth not the parallel strike home? Is not the Empire of to-day Another and a lewder Rome? Is not this Realm, whose flag unfurl'd Flies now where'er the surges roar, Even as that wonder of the world Sung by your Juvenal of yore? THE ÆON. My Juvenal? THE POET. At least you'll grant 'Tis such a Bard the people want— Fearless, free-spoken, sane, and strong, To smite with stern and savage song This monstrous Age of shams and lies? THE ÆON. Nay, on my soul! I recognise The justice of your parallel, As high as Heaven, as deep as Hell; But not by hate and not by scorn, Not by the arts of bards outworn, I work! I conquer and confute By Love and Pity absolute! And he who earns my praise must find The Light beyond these clouds of Fate,— By love, not hate, for Humankind, Must he enfranchise and unbind The slaves whom God leaves desolate! THE POET. Amen! THE ÆON. For in his throat he lies, Who, taught by tyrants, sees in me The Evil Spirit that denies,— Nay, by my Christ's poor blinded eyes, My task is to affirm and free! THE POET. Your Christ? THE ÆON. Yea, mine! I claim as kin All noble souls, however blind, Who freely stake their lives to win Respite of sorrow for mankind! 'Tis true He failed, like all who fancy That tears can stay God's chariot-wheels, And seek with childish necromancy The Force which neither spares nor feels. Peace to His dream! He loved men well, Despite that superstitious leaven,— He help'd to calm the unrest of Hell, Although He failed to climb to Heaven! Like Him I place beneath my ban, With sycophant and knave and priest, Those bitter fools who find in Man Only the instincts of the Beast! For now (as you yourself have sung) See infra ‘The Last Faith.’ In faith in Man lies Man's last chance! Only the over-old or over-young Look on Humanity askance! But to your parallel again— How do you prove and make it plain? THE POET. Look back across the rolling years, Through Time's dark mist of blood and tears, Across the graves of those who died Despite their Saviour crucified, And mark the imperial City rise The cynosure of all men's eyes! Domitian rules! Though men still see The crimson light on Calvary, From east to west, in every land, The Roman banners are unfurled, And the strong Roman's blood-red brand Reapeth the harvests of the world. Shrieks of the slain beyond the foam Gladden the crowds who rest at home— The gilded throng at Cæsar's heels, The runners by his chariot-wheels, The Priests and Augurs who intone Praise of the gods around his throne. A thousand starve, a few are fed, Legions of robbers rack the poor, The rich man steals the widow's bread, And Lazarus dies at Dives' door; The Lawyer and the Priest adjust The claims of Luxury and Lust To seize the earth and hold the soil, To store the grain they never reap,— Under their heels the white slaves toil, While children wail and women weep!— The gods are dead, but in their name Humanity is sold to shame, While (then as now!) the tinsel'd Priest Sitteth with robbers at the feast, Blesses the laden blood-stain'd board, Weaves garlands round the butcher's sword, And poureth freely (now as then) The sacramental blood of Men! THE ÆON. Ah me! THE POET. Pursue the parallel: Hear the New Woman rant and rage, Unsex'd, unshamed, she fits full well The humours of a godless age,— Too proud to suckle fools at home, From every woman's function free, Lo (now as then!) she leads in Rome The dance of Death and Vanity! In manly guise she strives with men In the Arena (now as then!) Or by some painted Player's side Sits lissome-limb'd and wanton-eyed, Forgetting for a Mummer's nod Her sex, her children, and her God! THE ÆON. Stop there! my poet must not flout at Woman! ‘Das Ewigweibliche’ is still my care! Thro' her, so long the White Slave of the Human, I mean to baulk the blundering Force up there! The reign of Fools and Dandies, Prigs and Clerics, Is o'er, with all its creeds of fiddle-faddle— And lo, she leaves her vapours and hysterics, And on the merry wheel she rides astraddle! Unsex'd? Enfranchised, rather! Slave no longer, Each hour she groweth saner, fairer, stronger, Full-soul'd in health, redeem'd from superstition, Yet mightier for her functions of fruition! THE POET. To breed and suckle fools and madmen? These Alone can live in the accurst time coming! Lo!—all the gods men hailed on bended knees Are fallen and dead, and o'er the seven seas Only the little banjo-bards are strumming! O Age of Wind and windy reputations, Of Windmill-newspapers that grind no grain!— Where once the Poet sang to listening nations The leader-writer pipes his servile strain, Praises the gods he knows are dead and cold, Hails the great Jingo-Christ's triumphal car, Nay, in that false Christ's name, grown over-bold, Shrieks havoc, and lets loose the dogs of War! THE ÆON. Nay, pass the peddling knaves whose hands have hurled Trash by the ton upon a foolish world, Who print in brutal type the gigman's creed For the great mass of rogues who run and read! Come to the Seers and Singers, on whose page We read the glory of thy Mother-Age— Off hat to those, the mighty men, whose names The Empire honours and the world acclaims! THE POET. Find them! THE ÆON. I' faith, I leave that task to you— Whom do you honour? Surely one or two? THE POET. Not those at least whom Rumour's brazen throat Trumpets as worthy of the crown and bays— Dress-suited sages, gentlemen of note, Sure of the newsman's nod, the gigman's praise. I turn from them, the sycophantic horde Who tune their scrannel throats to praise the Lord, And seek the heights whereon the Wise Men stand . . . Lo!—the Philosopher!—with cheek on hand And sad eyes fix'd on God's deserted Throne, He cries, ‘Rejoice, since nothing can be known! I show, beyond my ever-lengthening track Of synthesis, the eternal—Cul de sac!’ Lo, then, the Poet!—happy, and at home In all the arts and crafts of learnèd Rome, He sees the bloody pageant of despair, All Nature moaning 'neath its load of care, Takes off his hat, and with a bow polite Chirps, ‘God is in his Heaven! The world's all right!’ Add unto these the Sage who in the school Of Timon madden'd and became God's Fool, And all the would-be Titans of the time Who pant in cumbrous prose or rant in rhyme,— Where shall one find, to slake his soul's desire, The piteous mood or cloud-compelling fire? THE ÆON. More satire, eh?—I' faith, if you'd your will The Gods of this our Rome would fare but ill— You ask too much, my friend! . . . But hark, that cry! The hosts of Tommy Atkins passing by! The Flag that for a thousand years has braved The battle and the breeze is floating there! What Shakespeare glorified and Nelson saved Is worth, I think, some little praise and prayer! Even I, the Devil, at that note Feel the lump rising in my throat! 'Tis something, after all, you must agree, To mark the old Flag float from sea to sea! THE POET. Amen!—God bless the flag, and God bless those Who bled that it might wave aloft this day, The nameless, fameless martyrs, who repose Unwept, unmourn'd, on shores afar away!— Honour to those who died for this our Rome, Honour to those who, while we crow at home, Preserve our freedom for a beggar's pay! ‘Let loose the dogs of War!’ the gigman cries, Feasting on gold while Tommy starves and dies; ‘Glory to England and to us its brave!’ He shouts, while hirelings dig the soldier's grave! O shame! O mockery! for a little gold The freedom which we vaunt is bought and sold,— And when a foeman smites us in the face, ‘A blow!’ we cry; ‘prepare the battle-field!’ Then bribe a starving wretch to take our place And draw the ancestral sword we fear to wield! THE ÆON. You're out of temper with the times And overstate your accusation,— 'Tis not her follies or her crimes That keep this England still a Nation! The gigman's lust, the bagman's greed, The counter-jumper's peddling creed, Are foam and froth of the great wave Of Freedom rolling proudly on— This England's heart of hearts is brave And duteous as in ages gone! The mercenary, who fulfils The bloody deed another wills, No alien is,—within his veins the bold And fearless blood of a great race is flowing— The flower of Valour, though 'tis bought and sold, At least is home-bred and of English growing! Enough of Rome! My Poet's gentle eyes Are blinded with the City's garish day— Sleep in the Moonlight for a time! you'll rise Renew'd and strong, and Care will wing away. Yonder among the hills of thyme and heather I'm holding Jubilee myself full soon; The Spirits of the Age will feast together And there'll be merry doings 'neath the moon. Join us! you'll find the mountain air more pleasant Than this foul City gas you breathe at present; Since to your soul these voices sound abhorrent, Exchange them for the voices of the Torrent; With dewy starlight freshen up your fancy, Dip once again in Nature's lonely fountains, And when you've drunk your fill of necromancy, Flash back to Rome your message from the Mountains! Songs of Empire. ‘Monstro, quod ipse tibi possis dare: semita certe Tranquillæ per virtutem patet unica vitæ. Nullum numen habes, si sit prudentia: nos te, Nos facimus, Fortuna, Deam, cœloque locamus!’ Juv., Sat. x. CARMEN DEIFIC. I. Awake, awake, ye Nations, now the Lord of Hosts goes by! Sing ye His praise, O happy souls, who smile beneath the sky! Join in the song, O martyr'd ones, where'er ye droop and die! The Lord goes marching on! 'Mid tramp and clangour of the winds and clash of clash of clouds that meet, He passeth on His way and treads the Lost beneath His feet; His legions are the winged Storms that follow fast and fleet Their Master marching on! From battlefield to battlefield He wends in royal array, Dead worlds are strewn like wither'd leaves on His triumphal way, The new Suns blossom at His touch, the old spent Suns grow grey; Their Lord goes marching on! His eyes are blind with their own Light, He knows not where He goes, The Day before, the Night behind, with all its wails and woes, And ever more on foul and fair His glory overflows As He goes marching on! He is the Sea without a bound, for ever strong and free, Lord of the worlds that break like waves, and every wave is He, He is the foam that flies and falls and yet He is the Sea For ever rolling on! He could not if He would turn back and listen to thy prayer, He could not if He would dispel the clouds of thy despair,— Impotent in omnipotence He wends He knows not where, For ever marching on! He hath no time to pause a space and look upon thy Dead, How should He heed the living dust He crushes 'neath His tread? Blind, deaf, and dumb, He heareth not when prayer or curse is said, But still goes marching on! Awake, awake, ye Nations, now the Lord of Hosts goes by! Sing ye His praise, O happy ones, who round His chariot fly, Join in the song, if so ye list, ye Lost, who droop and die,— The Lord goes marching on! II. Out of the dust beneath His tread, Ashes and dust beneath His train, Dust and earth of the living-dead, Rises this ant-heap of Rome again! Tower and turret and palace-dome, Mart and temple, arise once more . . . Where is the glory that once was Rome? Where are the laurels its Cæsars wore? Quickens the dust to a human cry, Ashes and dust take shape and form, Once again as the Lord goes by Ashes are living and dust is warm, Crowds to our insect cities come, Legions of ants increase their store . . . Where is the glory that once was Rome? Where are the laurels its Cæsars wore? Empire fair as any of old, Proud it stands in the rosy light! For crumbs of bread and morsels of gold Its people struggle from morn to night, Seize their plunder and carry it home, Slay each other like folks of yore,— So they slew in that other Rome Plucking the laurels the Cæsars wore! A little while and a little life— A little life and an endless rest— An endless rest to the fever'd strife Of atoms heedlessly ban'd or blest! Others have made this clod their home, Lived and vanished through Death's dark door . . . Where is the glory that once was Rome? Where are the laurels the Cæsars wore? III. ‘How long, my love,’ she whisper'd, ‘How long shall it be,— The light upon the mountain-tops, The sunlight on the sea? For ever and for ever, Or only for a day?’ He drew her gently to him And kiss'd her tears away— ‘Perchance, dear love, for ever, Perchance for a day!’ ‘How long, my love,’ she whisper'd, ‘How long shall it be,— The joy that thrills across the earth And mingles you and me? For ever and for ever, Too sweet to pass away?’ He sigh'd, ‘If not for ever, At least for a day! So heart to heart, my darling, If only for a day!’ IV. Stand up, Ephemeron! This hour at least is thine, though it must fly! So waste it not by gazing at the sky With eyes so woe-begone! Thou shalt be dust anon, Who now art rapture and a living thing! Grasping what gifts the winged moments bring, Rejoice, Ephemeron! Increase, Ephemeron! Thou hast a time to quicken in delight, And after thee shall others no less bright Follow, when thou art gone! Be proud and buckle on Thy pigmy armour and thine insect mail! Strive with thy kind, and, though a thousand fail, Emerge, Ephemeron! V. If I were a God like you, and you were a man like me, If from a throne omnipotent I ruled all things that be, Tidings of light and love I'd send as far as thought could fly, And one great hymn of happiness should sound from sky to sky,— And on your brow my gentle hand should shed the saving dew, If you were a man like me, and I were a God like you! If I were a God like you, and you were a man like me, And in the dark you prayed and wept and I could hear and see, The sorrow of your broken heart would darken all my day, And never peace or pride were mine, till it was smiled away,— I'd clear my Heaven above your head till all was bright and blue, If you were a man like me, and I were a God like you! If I were a God like you, and you were a man like me, Small need for those my might had made to bend the suppliant knee; I'd light no lamp in yonder Heaven to fade and disappear, I'd break no promise to the Soul, yet keep it to the ear! High as my heart I'd lift my child till all his dreams came true, If you were a man like me, and I were a God like you! VI. A Voice was heard in the night, and it haunts the night for ever, And these are the words of the Voice that God shall silence never: ‘How often, God of the Glad, and God of the Lost, shall I name Thee! Cursing Thee under breath, too weak to stay Thee or shame Thee! ‘Blundering blindly on, with blood and tears for Thy token, Thou tramplest down the Weak, yea the Strong by Thee are broken! ‘Yet still Thy praise is heard, the perishing pray unto Thee,— And lo! I woke in the night, and smiled for methought I knew Thee! ‘I watch'd Thy sacrifice flame up, and I did not falter, Though the lamb and the little child were offered up on the Altar! ‘I praised Thy Day and Thy Night, Thy manifold works and wonders. Thy purpose gladden'd my soul, O God of a million blunders! ‘From failure on to failure I saw Thy Light progressing, I felt the lash of Thy Law, yet knelt to entreat Thy blessing. ‘Thou hast not spared Thy dearest, Thy best beloved Thou art slaying, Thine ears are shut to the prayers of Thy Saints, yet lo, I am praying! ‘I fear Thee, God of the Night, for Thy Silence hath overcome me. I hear the wails of the souls Thy Night hath taken from me. ‘Darkness shrouds Thy feet, and darkness Thy Face is veiling— Shepherd, 'tis dark all round, and Thou comest not to our wailing!’ This Voice was heard in the Night, and the Lord shall still it never! For those are the words of the Voice that cries in the Night for ever! THE IMAGE IN THE FORUM. Not Baal, but Christus-Jingo! Heir Of Him who once was crucified! The red stigmata still are there, The crimson spear-wounds in the side; But raised aloft as God and Lord, He holds the Money-bag and Sword. See, underneath the Crown of Thorn, The eyeballs fierce, the features grim! And merrily from night to morn We chaunt his praise and worship him, Great Christus-Jingo, at whose feet Christian and Jew and Atheist meet! A wondrous god! most fit for those Who cheat on 'Change, then creep to prayer; Blood on his heavenly altar flows, Hell's burning incense fills the air, And Death attests in street and lane The hideous glory of his reign. O gentle Jew, from age to age Walking the waves Thou could'st not tame, This god hath ta'en Thy heritage, And stolen Thy sweet and stainless Name! To him we crawl and bend the knee, Naming Thy Name, but scorning Thee! THE AUGURS. Darken the Temple from the light, Shut out the sun and sky,— In Darkness deep as Death and Night Lead forth the Lamb to die! We hold the golden knife aloft, and lo! we prophesy. Augurs and priests in crimson stoled, We ring the Altar round: Above us, gaunt and grey and cold, The Man-god hangs, thorn-crown'd— Ragged and wretched waits the crowd, watching, without a sound. With blood their hunger we appease (Else all our task were vain); Trembling they watch on bended knees The Man-god's sculptured pain; Then wait in wonder while we search the entrails of the Slain! THE JEW PASSES. With slow monotonous tread, A Phantom hoary and grey, While Heaven was shining overhead, He wandered on His way: And still His thin feet bled, And His eyes were dim with tears— ‘Surely at last,’ He said, ‘My father in Heaven hears? ‘Surely now at last My Cross is a blossoming tree,— Evil and sorrow are past, My Throne is ready for me?’ Worn and wan and white, He gazed to Heaven and smiled, And the restless wind of the night Slept, like a sleeping child. Slowly along the dark Unseen by Men crept He, But the Earth lay silently down to mark In the soft still arms of the Sea! He came to a City great, Silent under the sky, And the watchmen at the gate Beheld Him not go by. Passing the empty mart, Creeping from shade to shade, He found at last in the City's heart A Temple that men had made. Dark at the Temple door The ragged and outcast lay, And Lazarus wail'd once more, Weary and gaunt and grey. And an altar-light burn'd there, And a litany sounded thence— ‘Rejoice! rejoice! for all gods that were Are banish'd and vanish'd hence! ‘And the only god we know Is the ghost of our own despair; Gaze in the glass, and lo! Is he not mirror'd there? ‘Strong as when time began, Creature of dust and breath, God our Lord, the Spirit of Man, Crown'd with the crown of Death!’ And lo! from earth and sea, And the skies now overcast, A voice wail'd, ‘Woe is me! Death is the first and last!’ He went with silent feet Thro' loathsome alley and den; He heard around Him from every street The moan of the Magdalen. ‘How long, O Lord, how long,’ He heard the lone voice cry, ‘Shall they who wrought the wrong, While we lie lost, go by? ‘Reach down thy hand,’ it moaned, ‘To help the lost, and me,— Rabbi, the Woman still is stoned, The Man still wanders free!’ Still and unseen crept He Into the prison-square, And He saw the Upas Tree Of Man's Invention there . . . High as the Cross it stood, Cross-wise its shadows fell, And the sap of the tree was tears and blood And its roots sank deep as Hell. ‘Rabbi!’ again that cry Came from a lonely place— And she who waited to die Had a Woman's form and face. ‘Reach down thy hand,’ she moaned, ‘To help the lost, and me,— Rabbi, the Woman still is stoned, The Man still wanders free! ‘The lie, the blight, and the ban, That doom me, men have cast— By Man I fell, and my Judge, a man, Threw the first stone, and last. ‘Master, master!’ she said, ‘Hither, come hither to me!’ He left His blessing upon her head, His curse on the Upas Tree! And all His soul was stirr'd, His tears like red blood ran, While the light of the woeful Word Flamed on the City of Man! And the heavens grew black as night, And the voice cried: ‘Wander on!’ And the cold Moon's arms clung wild and white Round a World all woe-begone! He walked upon the Sea, And the lamb-like waves lay still, And He came to Calvary And the Crosses high on the hill. Beneath His Cross He stood, Between the thief and the thief; And lo, the Cross dript blood, dript blood, And never put forth a leaf! With slow monotonous tread He passed from sea to sea. ‘So long, so long!’ He said, ‘And still no sleep for me!’ A SONG OF JUBILEE. I Ho, heirs of Saxon Alfred And Cœur de Lion bold! Mix'd breed of churls and belted earls Who worshipped God of old; Who harried East and harried West And gather'd land and gold, While from the lips of white-wing'd ships Our battle-thunder rolled! With a hey! and a ho! And a British three times three! At the will of the Lord of the Cross and Sword We swept from sea to sea! II And lo, our mighty Empire Rises like Rome of yore— Another Rome, that feasts at home And hugs its golden store; Another and a mightier Rome! That, growing more and more, Now reaches from Saint Paul's great dome To far Tasmania's shore! With a hey! and a ho! And a British three times three! True strain and seed of the Ocean-breed, We keep this Jubilee! III Liegemen of Bess the Virgin, Heirs of the harlot Nell! Our once bright blood hath mix'd with mud More oft than song need tell; But through each hour of pride and power, When free we fought and fell, What gave us might to face the Fight Was—faith in Heaven and Hell! With a hey! and a ho! And a British three times three! Though the faith hath fled and our Lord lies dead, We keep this Jubilee! IV Stay! By the Soul of Milton! By Cromwell's battle-cry! The voice of the Lord of the Cross and Sword Still rings beneath our sky! Our faith lives still in the stubborn Will No Priest or Pope could buy— Ours is the crced of the doughty Deed, The strength to do and die! With a hey! and a ho! And a British three times three! Still sword in hand 'neath the Cross we stand And keep this Jubilee! V Lady and Queen and Mother! Our long sea-race is run! Let Love and Peace bless and increase What Cross and Sword have won! The nameless guilt, the red blood spilt, The deeds in darkness done, All these are past, and our souls at last Stand shriven in the sun, With a hey! and a ho! And a British three times three! We Men of the Deep sheathe swords, and keep Thy bloodless Jubilee! VI Queen of the many races That round thy footstool cling, Take heed lest Cain o'erthrow again His brother's offering! Beyond the waves crawl butchering knaves, Now crouching for the spring, While stolen gold stains, as of old, The gift thy legions bring! With a hey! and a ho! And a British three times three! There are robbers still who are fain to spill Blood, on thy Jubilee! VII Ghosts of sad Queens departed Watch thee from far away: Not theirs the bliss and calm of this Thy peaceful triumph-day! A faith more fearless and serene, A creed less swift to slay, Are thine, if thou hast found, O Queen, A gentler God for stay! With a hey! and a ho! And a British three times three! We thy might proclaim in that one God's Name On this thy Jubilee. THE MERCENARIES. I. Tommie Atkins. Shrieking and swinging legs, astride On his native fence, the Cockney cried: ‘Fee faw fum! beware of me! I am the Lord of Land and Sea!’ Out on the fields, where day and night The weary warriors strove in fight, They paused a space to gaze upon The moat-surrounded fence,—his throne! And while they heard that war-cry float From the smug Cockney's raucous throat, ‘Come off the fence,’ they cried, ‘and share The brunt of battle, if you dare!’ Yet still they heard him shriek and brag Waving a little schoolboy's Flag, And angry at his martial mien They tried to hoot him from the scene! ‘Ho ho!’ he said, ‘if that's your plan, I'll teach you I'm an Englishman!— Here, Tommie Atkins,—take your fee,— Go fight these knaves who flout at me!’ Poor Tommie Atkins waiting stood, And heard his master's cry for blood, Then held out hand to take his pay, And drew his sword, and sprang away! All day the bloody strife was wrought, The Cockney shriek'd, while Tommie fought. Night came, the foe were driven away,— But Tommie Atkins dying lay. ‘Tommie, what cheer?’ the Cockney said; Poor Tommie raised his bleeding head,— ‘You've lick'd them, sir!’ poor Tommie cried, And slowly droop'd his head, and died! Still on his fence the Cockney swings, Loud in the air the war-cry rings, And still, in answer to his cries, Poor Tommie Atkins bleeds and dies. II. Nelson's Day. Here's to the health of Nelson! Hurrah and three times three! Glory to him who gave us back our birth-right of the Sea! He gave us back the wide wide Sea, and bade us rule the wave, And how did we pay him back, dear boys, for that great gift he gave? Just as his life was ebbing ('Twas in Trafalgar's bay) He craved one little thing from us for whom he fell that day; For in that hour of glorious death his last thoughts landward ran, Since, alas and alas, my Christian friends, he wasn't a moral man! ‘Take care of Lady Hamilton!’ the dying hero cried,— 'Twas all he asked from Englishmen for whom he fought and died; ‘Now I have bought you with my blood the Sea and all thereon, Take care of her I love,’ he said, ‘when I am dead and gone!’ His health, the health of Nelson! health to the good, the brave! But still we're moral men, dear boys, with moral souls to save . . . We suffered her he loved to starve, to fill a pauper's grave,— That's how we paid him back, dear boys, for the great gift he gave! Honour to Nelson's memory! his health with three times three! If we are freemen 'twas his gift—he gave us back the Sea,— Crow, west to east! but while we shout his name from wave to wave, Think how we paid our Hero back for the great gift he gave! SONG OF THE SLAIN. This is the Song of the Weak Trod 'neath the heel of the Strong! This is the Song of the hearts that break And bleed as we ride along,— From sea to sea we singing sweep, but this is the slain man's Song! Southward, a shriek of pain, As the martyr'd races fall! The wild man's land and his herds we gain, With the gold that's best of all,— Because the leaves of the tree are black 'tis meet that they should fall! Eastward, another cry, Wrung from the black and red! But merrily our hosts go by, Trampling the quick and dead,— 'Tis meet that the heathen tribes should starve, and the Christian dogs be fed. Westward, close at the door, A cry for bread and light! But lo, we hug our golden store And feast from morn to night:— Our brother Esau must perish too, altho' his skin be white! In the name of the Jingo-Christ We raise our savage song, In gold the martyr's blood is priced Wherever we march along, How should we heed our brother's cry,—he is weak and we are strong! We have sow'd, and lo! we reap, We are strong, and lo! we slay; We are lords of Earth and Deep, And this is our triumph-day,— The broken wave and the broken heart are spent, and vanish away! Ever the Weak must fall Under the strength of the Strong! And God (they say), who is Lord of all, Smiles as we sweep along; Yet tho' we are strong and our song is loud, this is the slain man's Song! THE CHARTER'D COMPANIE. I The Devil's Not the great Æon, whom I have vindicated, Call'd falsely Devil by the blind and base, But Belial, a creature execrated Except in Church and in the market-place. —R. B. will is the Devil's still, whereever the Devil may be— He used to delight in the thick of the fight, whether on land or sea; 'Twas difficult for mortal men to know what side he took, When the wrath of the Lord from heaven was poured and the whole Creation shook; Yet for many a day the Devil's way was ever mighty and grand, 'Mid the swift sword's flash and the cannon's crash he boldly took his stand: Such perilous work he has learn'd to shirk, and quiet at home sits he, Having turn'd himself for the love of pelf to a Charter'd Companie! II ‘Ho! better far than the work of War, and the storm and stress of strife, Is to rest at home, while others roam,’ he murmurs to Sin, his wife! ‘Tho' the fiends my sons make Gatling guns, they're Christians to the core, And they love the range of the Stock Exchange far better than battle-roar. They are spared, in truth, much strife uncouth and trouble by field and flood, Since the work of Hell is done so well by creatures of flesh and blood; And I think on the whole,’ says the grim old Soul, ‘'tis better for you and me That I've turned myself, ere laid on the shelf, to a Charter'd Companie! III ‘The thin red line was doubtless fine as it crept across the plain, While the thick fire ran from the black Redan and broke it again and again, But the hearts of men throbb'd bravely then, and their souls could do and dare, 'Mid the thick of the fight, in my despite, God found out Heroes there! The Flag of England waved on high, and the thin red line crept on, And I felt, as it flashed along to die, my occupation gone! O'er a brave man's soul I had no control in those old days,’ said he, ‘So I've turned myself, ere laid on the shelf, to a Charter'd Companie! IV ‘The Flag of England still doth blow and flings the sunlight back, But the line that creepeth now below is changed to a line of black! Wherever the Flag of England blows, down go all other flags, Wherever the line of black print goes, the British Bulldog brags! The newspaper, my dear, is best to further such work as mine,— My blessing rest, north, south, east, west, on the thin black penny-a-line! For my work is done 'neath moon or sun, by men and not by me, Now I've changed myself, in the reign of the Guelph, to a charter'd Companie! V ‘Of Church and of State let others prate, let martyr'd thousands moan,— I m responsible, I beg to state, to my share-holders alone! The Flag of England may rot and fall, both Church and State may end, Whate'er befall, I laugh at it all, if I pay a dividend! But O my dear, it is very clear that the thing is working well— When they hunt the black man down like deer, we devils rejoice in Hell! 'Tis loot, loot, loot, as they slaughter and shoot out yonder across the sea, Now I've turned myself, like a gamesome elf, to a Charter'd Companie! VI ‘Just study, my dear, the record here, of the mighty deeds they've done— Hundreds, en masse, mowed down like grass, to an English loss of one! Then loot, loot, loot, as they slaughter and shoot, to the shrieks of the naked foe, While murder and greed on the fallen feed, right up my stock must go! And the best of the lark, you'll be pleased to mark, is the counter-jumper's cry, As he clutches his shares and mumbles his prayers to the Jingo-God on high! With Bible and Gun the work is done both here and across the sea, Now I've turned myself, in the reign of the Guelph, to a Charter'd Companie!’ VII The Devil's will is the Devil's still, though wrought in a Christian land, He chuckles low and laughs his fill, with the latest news in hand; Nor God nor man can mar his plan so long as the markets thrive, Tho' the Flag be stained and the Creed profaned, he keepeth the game alive! ‘The Flag of England may rot and fall, both Church and State may end, Whatever befall, I laugh at it all, if I pay a dividend! Right glad I dwell where I make my Hell, in the white man's heart,’ cries he, ‘Now I've turned myself, for the love of pelf, to a Charter'd Companie!’ THE BALLAD OF KIPLINGSON. There came a knock at the Heavenly Gate, where the good St. Peter sat,— ‘Hi, open the door, you fellah there, to a British rat-tat-tat!’ The Saint sat up in his chair, rubb'd eyes, and prick'd his holy ears, ‘Who's there?’ he muttered, ‘a single man, or a regiment of Grenadiers?’ ‘A single man,’ the voice replied, ‘but one of prodigious size, Who claims by Jingo, his patron Saint, the entry to Paradise!’ The good St. Peter open'd the Gate, but blocking the entry scan'd The spectacled ghost of a little man, with an infant's flag in his hand. ‘Your name? Before I let you pass, say who and what you were! Describe your life on the earth, and prove your claim to a place in there!’ ‘Wot! haven't you heard of Kiplingson? whose name and fame have spread As far as the Flag of England waves, and the Tory prints are read? ‘I was raised in the lap of Jingo, sir, till I grew to the height of man, And a wonderful Literary Gent, I emerged upon Hindostan! ‘I sounded the praise of the Empire, sir, I pitch'd out piping hot The new old stories of British bounce (see Lever and Michael Scott); ‘And rapid as light my glory spread, till thro' Cockaigne it flew, And I grew the joy of the Cockney cliques, and the pet of the Jingo Jew! ‘For the Lord my God was a Cockney Gawd, whose voice was a savage yell, A fust-rate Gawd who dropt, d'ye see, the “h” in Heaven and Hell! ‘O I was clever beyond compare, and not like most young muffs, Tho' I died last night, at an early age, of a plethora of puffs. ‘O lollipops are toothsome things, and sweet is the log-roll'd jam, But the last big puff of the Log-rollers has choked me, and here I am! ‘But I was a real Phenomenon,’ continued Kiplingson, ‘The only genius ever born who was Tory at twenty-one!’ ‘Alas, and alas,’ the good Saint said, a tear in his eye serene, ‘A Tory at twenty-one! Good God! At fifty what would you have been? ‘There's not a spirit now here in Heaven who wouldn't at twenty-one Have tried to upset the very Throne, and reform both Sire and Son! ‘The saddest sight that my eyes have seen, down yonder on earth or here, Is a brat that talks like a weary man, or a youth with a cynic's leer. ‘Try lower down, young man,’ he cried, and began to close the Gate— ‘Hi, here, old fellah,’ said Kiplingson, ‘by Jingo! just you wait— ‘I've heaps of Criticisms here, to show my claims are true, That I'm 'cute in almost everything, and have probed Creation through!’ ‘And what have you found?’ the Saint inquired, a frown on his face benign— ‘The Flag of England!’ cried Kiplingson, ‘and the thin black penny-a-line! ‘Wherever the Flag of England waves, down go all other flags; Wherever the thin black line is spread, the Bulldog bites and brags! ‘And I warn you now, if you close that Gate, the moment it is done, I'll summon an army of Cockney Gents, with a great big Gatling gun! ‘O Gawd, beware of the Jingo's wrath! the Journals of Earth are mine! Across the plains of the earth still creeps the thin black penny-a-line! ‘For wherever the Flag of England waves’— but here, we grieve to state, His voice was drown'd in a thunder-crash, for the Saint bang'd-to the Gate! TO OLIVE SCHREINER. Pansies, for thoughts; and Rue, for gentle grief; Roses,—for gladness given in large increase: Add now to these one soft grey silvern leaf, Olive,—for Peace! O life that put'st our noisier lives to shame, Sign that the Bow shall shine, the Deluge cease! Steadfast and true and holy like thy name: Olive,—for Peace! THE DREAMER OF DREAMS. I ‘We are men in a world of men, not gods!’ the Strong Man cried; ‘Yea, men, but more than men,’ the Dreamer of Dreams replied; ‘'Tis not the mighty Arm (the Lion and Bear have that), Tis not the Ear and the Eye (for those hath the Ounce and the Cat), 'Tis not the form of a Man upstanding erect and free, For this hath the forest Ape, yea, the face of a Man hath he; 'Tis not by these alone, ye compass'd the mighty things, Hew'd the log to a ship, till the ship swept out on wings, Ye are men in a world of men, lord of the seas and streams, But ye dreamed ye were more than men when ye heark'd to the Dreamers of Dreams! And the Dream begat the Deed, and grew with the growth of the years, So ye were the Builders of Earth, but we were the Pioneers! II ‘By the Arm and the Ear and the Eye, and the upright Form divine’ (Thus the Dreamer of Dreams), ‘thou hast conquered the world—’tis thine; Wherefore rejoice, O Man, in the wonders thy might hath wrought, But woe to thy pride the day thou forgettest the Dream we brought; The Dream that made thee a Man (the beast was as swift in the fray), The Dream that found thee a Soul, and lit thee along on thy way, The Dream that guided thine Arm, and taught thee with sight and with sound, The Dream that held thee erect when the beast was prone on the ground! A man in a world of men, and strong as a man beseems, Thou art indeed, but thy strength was drawn from the Dreamers of Dreams! Wert thou no more than a man, the Fox and the Ape were thy peers, We dream'd thou wast more than a man, when we led thee, thy Pioneers! III ‘And now thy triumph hath come, the sceptre is set in thy hand, See’ (said the Dreamer of Dreams) ‘that thy spirit doth understand: Not by the lust of the Ape, or the courage and strength of the Beast, Thou risest to rule thy Realm, and sit at the head of the Feast— We dream'd there was love in thy heart, the love that no beast doth gain, We held thee just in our Dream, and therefore fitter to reign, And though there was blood on thy sword, and lust of blood in thy breast, We taught thee (still in our Dream) that Pity and Prayer were best: Pity for all thy kind, and most for the undertrod, Prayer to the Power unseen which stiffen'd thy soul 'gainst God, Then out of the Dream the Deed, which grew with the growing years And made thee Master of Earth, but we were thy Pioneers!’ IV ‘We are men in a world of men, not gods,’ the Strong Man cried. ‘Then woe to thy race and thee,’ the Dreamer of Dreams replied; ‘The Tiger can fight and feed, the Serpent can hear and see, The Ape can increase his kind, the Beaver can build, like thee. Have I led thee on to find thee of all things last and least, A Man who is only a Man and therefore less than a beast? Who bareth a red right arm, and crieth “Lo! I am strong;” Who shouts to an empty sky a savage triumphal song, Who apes the cry of the woods, who crawls like a snake and lies, Who loves not, neither is loved, but crawleth a space and dies?— Ah, woe indeed to the Dream that guided thee all these years, And woe to the Dreamers of Dreams who ran as thy Pioneers!’ BE PITIFUL. Thou canst not right the ancient wrong, Or mend the broken thread; Thou canst not raise with spell or song The countless martyrs dead,— Yet one kind thought may sometimes bless Lives which the dark gods ban; Wherefore, since they are pitiless, Be pitiful, O Man! Raised on the rock of endless woe, Thy throne is built, O King! Yet from that rock some dews may flow To show the hidden spring;— Lord in thy place of life and death, Complete the cruel plan, But gazing down on things of breath, Be pitiful, O Man! Be pitiful! be pitiful! More grace in Pity lies Than in the gladdest flowers they cull In Passion's Paradise! Thron'd on the earth even as a god, All creatures gently scan— Thy sceptre then like Aaron's rod Shall bud and bloom, O Man! Be pitiful to every thing That creeps around thy throne, Yea, with thy love as with a wing Shelter the lost and lone;— Tho' from the cradle to the tomb Thy reign is but a span, Still, in despite of Death and Doom, Be pitiful, O Man! So shall thy soul arise in strength Above the coward's dread, So shall thy love avenge at length The blood the gods have shed, So shalt thou scorn the cruel Law That is since Time began, And, held by Heaven and Hell in awe, Shame all the gods, O Man! MAN OF THE RED RIGHT HAND. Man with the Red Right Hand knelt in the night and prayed: ‘Pity and spare, O God, the mortal whom thou hast made! Strengthen the house he builds, adorn his glad roof-tree, Blessing the bloody spoil he gathers on earth and sea! The bird and the beast are blind, and they do not understand, But lo! thy servant kneels!’ said Man with the Red Right Hand. God went by in the Storm and answered never a word. But the birds of the air shrieked loud and the beasts of the mountain heard, And the dark sad flocks of the Sea and the Sea-lambs gentle-eyed Wail'd from their oozy folds, and the mild Sea-kine replied, And the pity of God fell down like darkness on sea and land, But froze to ice in the heart of Man with the Red Right Hand. Then up he rose from his knee and brandish'd the crimson knife, Saying: ‘I thank thee, God, for making me Lord of Life! The beasts and the birds are mine, and the flesh and blood of the same, Baptised in the blood of these, I gladden and praise thy name! Laden with spoils of life thy servant shall smiling stand!’ And out on the Deep he hied, this Man with the Red Right Hand. Afar on the lonely isles the cry of the slaughtered herds Rose on the morning air, to the scream of the flying birds, And the birds fell down and bled with pitiful human cries, And the butcher'd Lambs of the Sea lookt up with pleading eyes, And the blood of bird and beast was red on sea and land, And drunk with the joy of Death was Man with the Red Right Hand. And the fur of the slain sea-lamb was a cloak for his bride to wear, And the broken wing of the bird was set in his leman's hair, And the flesh of the ox and lamb were food for his brood to eat, And the skin of the mild sea-kine was shoon on his daughter's feet! And the cry of the slaughtered things was loud over sea and land As he knelt once more and prayed, upraising his Red Right Hand. ‘Pity me, Master and Lord! spare me and pass me by, Grant me Eternal Life, though the beast and the bird must die! Behold I worship thy Law, and gladden in all thy ways, The bird and the beast are dumb, but behold I sing thy praise, The bird and the beast are blind, and they do not understand, But lo, I see and know!’ said Man with the Red Right Hand. God went by in the Storm and answered never a word. But deep in the soul of Man the cry of a God was heard: ‘Askest thou pity, thou, who ne'er drew pitying breath? Askest thou fulness of life, whose life is built upon Death? Even as thou metest to these, thy kin of the sea and land, Shall it be meted to thee, O Man of the Red Right Hand! ‘When thou namest bird and beast, and blessest them passing by, When thy pleasure is built no more on the pain of things that die, When thy bride no longer wears the spoil of thy butcher's knife, Perchance thy prayer may reach the ears of the Lord of Life; Meantime be slain with the things thou slayest on sea and land,— Yea, pass in thy place like those, O Man with the Red Right Hand!’ SONG OF THE FUR-SEAL. See, passim, the descriptions of Dr. Gordon Stables, R.N., Captain Borchgrevink, Professor Jukes, and others, of the devilries which accompany the slaughter of the Fur-Seal. Who cometh out of the sea Wrapt in His winding-sheet? He who hung on the Tree With blood on His hands and feet,— On the frozen isles He leaps, and lo, the sea-lambs round Him bleat! The cry of the flocks o' the Sea Rings in the ears of the Man! Gentle and mild is He, Tho' worn and weak and wan; The mild-eyed seals look up in joy, His pitiful face to scan. They gather round Him there, He blesses them one and all,— On their eyes and tangled hair His tears of blessing fall;— But He starteth up and He listeneth, for He hears the hunter's call! Moaning in fear He flies Leading the wild sea-herds, O'er Him, under the skies, Follow the startled birds. ‘Father, look down!’ He moans aloud, and the Heavens fling back His words! The hunter's feet are swift, The feet of the Christ are slow, Nearer they come who lift Red hands for the butcher's blow,— Aye me, the bleeding lambs of the Sea, who struggle and wail in woe! Blind with the lust of death Are the red hunter's eyes, Around him blood like breath Streams to the silent skies,— Slain again 'mong the slain sea-lambs the white Christ moans and dies! ‘Even as the least of these, Butcher'd again, I fall!’ O gentle lambs of the Sea, Who leapt to hear Him call, Bleeding there in your midst He lies, who gladden'd and blest you all! And the hunter striding by, Blind, with no heart to feel, Laughs at the anguish'd cry, And crushes under his heel The head of the Christ that looketh up with the eyes of a slaughter'd seal! GOD EVOLVING. Turn from that mirage of a God on high Holding the sceptre of a creed outworn, And hearken to the faint half-human cry Of Nature quickening with the God unborn! The God unborn, the God that is to be, The God that has not been since Time began,— Hark,—that low sound of Nature's agony Echoed thro' life and the hard heart of Man! Fed with the blood and tears of living things, Nourish'd and strengthen'd by Creation's woes, The God unborn, that shall be King of Kings, Sown in the darkness, thro' the darkness grows. Alas, the long slow travail and the pain Of her who bears him in her mighty womb! How long ere he shall live and breathe and reign, While yonder Phantom fades to give him room? Where'er great pity is and piteousness, Where'er great Love and Love's strange sorrow stay, Where'er men cease to curse, but bend to bless, Frail brethren fashion'd like themselves of clay; Where'er the lamb and lion side by side Lie down in peace, where'er on land or sea Infinite Love and Mercy heavenly-eyed Emerge, there stirs the God that is to be! His light is round the slaughter'd bird and beast As round the forehead of Man crucified,— All things that live, the greatest and the least, Await the coming of this Lord and Guide; And every gentle deed by mortals done, Yea, every holy thought and loving breath, Lighten poor Nature's travail with this Son Who shall be Lord and God of Life and Death! No God behind us in the empty Vast, No God enthroned on yonder heights above, But God emerging, and evolved at last Out of the inmost heart of human Love! Wound Love, thou woundest, too, this God unborn! Of Love and Love's compassion is he bred! His strength the grace that holds no thing in scorn, His very blood the tears by Pity shed! And every cruel thought or deed on earth, Yea, even blood-sacrifice on bended knee, Lengthens the travail and delays the birth Of this our God, the God that is to be! ‘PATRIOTISM.’ ‘Throughout all this period of Titanic struggle, patriotism was the most potent factor in the contest, and ultimately decided the issue. Animated by patriotism, which gave to her armies a superhuman strength, France was able to confound all the efforts of her enemies. Then, ignoring in all other nations a love of independence and freedom as strenuous as her own, she at last created and evoked in them this all-powerful sentiment, and was in the end driven back to her frontiers by an exhibition of the same spirit as that which had enabled her to defend them. . . . The fact is, that a vague attachment to the whole human race is a poor substitute for the performance of the duties of a citizen; and professions of universal philanthropy afford no excuse for neglecting the interests of one's own country.’—Joseph Chamberlain, in Glasgow. I Judas to Caiaphas, The Elders, and the Priests: ‘I, heir of him who sold the Man Whose voice disturb'd your feasts, My thirty pieces duly gained, The Cross and Sword upraise, And claim, for triumph thus attained, The Patriot's palm and bays! II ‘Who is the Patriot? He Who, swift and keen to slay, Spieth the helpless quarry out For home-bred birds of prey; Who heeds not hearts that ache and break, But peers from sea to sea, And ever, for his Country's sake, Points Christ to Calvary! III ‘The black Christs and the white, Lo, how they shriek and die, While the great conquering Flag floats on And merry hosts go by! I price in our imperial Mart Their land, their gold, their lives— Ho, Priests, who heeds the broken heart, So that the Market thrives? IV ‘Who is the Patriot? He Who strideth, sword in hand, To reap the fields he never sowed, For his own Fatherland! Who, sweeping human rights aside, Sets up the cross-shaped Tree, And while the Christ is crucified, Bids all the Thieves go free! V ‘This for a sign I speak— Heed it and understand— Who loves his neighbour as himself Loves, too, his neighbour's land! His neighbour's land, his wives, his gold, All the good thief may seize, And he's a Patriot twentyfold Who garners all of these! VI ‘All, for his Country's sake, His God, his Lord, his Home, Ev'n so the Roman stalk'd abroad And claimed the world for Rome, Ev'n so the patriot Nations still In emulation toil, Confront each other, shrieking shrill, And hungering for the spoil! VII ‘Remember how the Patriot's fire Swept Europe west to east, While on its trail devouring ran The many-headed Beast; Till dawn'd at last the glorious morn When all the Earth was priced By Patriotism's latest-born, The Imperial Antichrist! VII ‘Hark! still the Patriot's cry Yonder in France is heard— She slew her Kings, she found for men The blood-compelling Word: Arm'd to the teeth still croucheth she, Waketh, and sleepeth not— “Allons, enfants de la Patrie— To cut our neighbour's throat!” IX ‘Lo, how the same grand dream Of God and Fatherland Fills the brave Teuton's warrior-soul And arms his mailed hand; Beast-like for battle he prepares, Bow'd down with helm and glaive,— How proudly he, the Patriot, wears The livery of the Slave!’ X Judas to Caiaphas, The Elders, and the Priests: ‘I, heir of him who sold the Man Whose voice disturb'd your feasts, Bid ye, my brethren of the Blood, March on from sea to sea, Nor heed, 'mid Conquest's roaring flood, The cries from Calvary! XI ‘Patriots ye were and are, Yours is the Patriot's crown; The Patriot is the strong man, he Who strikes the weak man down! Onward with Cross and Sword, still race With all the world for prey,— I price, in this your market-place, The robes of Him ye slay!’ THE GRAND OLD MAN. (Westminster, March 1898.) I. Now the long volume of his life, As all in turn must be, Is closed, and placed remote from strife In Death's black library, Eternal honour to the name Kept clean from youth to age, With scarce a blot of sin or shame Upon the splendid page! The Grand Old Man! how few have writ A scroll so clean and clear!— Pilgrims shall come and ponder it For many and many a year; And ever as their eyes are cast Upon it shall descry, Yea, from the front page till the last, The name of the Most High! For in an age where strong men doubt This strong man doubted nought, But mail'd in faith, passed in and out The wind-blown flames of Thought; And ever from his lips there came The words of happy prayer, With which he, child-like, sought to shame The pessimist's despair. Ah, well, he was, when all is said, A gracious soul and kind— I do not weep that he is dead, I weep that he was blind! Blind with the Light that sears the sight With sheer excess of Day,— So true, so eager for the Right, And yet—so oft astray! A mighty leader and a guide, He led men long and well, First in the van, tho' blown aside By breaths from Heaven or Hell! Out of his very weakness strong, His very blindness brave, Serene and calm he march'd along To no inglorious grave. And round him now the ribald throng That mock'd his march is dumb, And honouring what they fear'd so long The rival factions come,— Nay, priests of every creed attest Him King of Humankind, Blessed 'mong men, but blessedest Because his eyes were blind! II. Battle and Storm? God screen'd his form From all Life's fiercest airs; His battle was of words, his storm Was one to lay with prayers! As true as steel, as pure as snow, He lived his gentle life Too shielded in his place to know The stress of human strife,— The woe, the anguish, the despair, Of mortals tempest-toss'd; In his soul's sails the wind blew fair Even when he struggled most! Easy it seems for such a man To keep his soul's page white— God never bow'd him with His ban Or marr'd him with His blight! His gentle hand ne'er lifted up The load of human pain, His lips not even touch'd the cup The broken-hearted drain; He thirsted not, nor lack'd for food, Nor stricken earthward grieved, But, sure that God was kind and good, He gladden'd and believed! His rose-crown'd cup ran o'er the brim With wine, not tear-drops sad— His God was very good to him, And kept him blind and glad! III. Peace, he was pure,—let that suffice! And brave in word and deed,— Why envy, in these caves of ice, The sunshine of his creed? The wind we feel so chill blows fresh On him, and such as he,— Tho' God who fashioneth the flesh Sendeth the Leprosy! Blest was his child-like faith and prayer, If not afar, yet here,— How dark and dull seems our despair Beside a faith so clear! He walked the broad and easy way And died and lived a child,— Yea, even on his stormiest day Folded his hands and smiled, Believing all things, doubting not That all was surely well,— Upon his soul one only blot, The death-stain of Parnell! Cleanse that one blot away, his fame Was star-like 'mongst his kind,— Yet even that from goodness came, Because God kept him blind! ‘THE UNION.’ The speech our English freemen spoke Still fills the plains afar, Where branches of our English oak Wave 'neath the Western star; ‘Be free!’ men cried in Shakespeare's tongue, When smiting for the slave— Thus Hampden's cry for freedom rung As far as Lincoln's grave! Back rings that cry from far away To fill the Motherland, Where 'neath the Union Jack this day Both false and true men stand— Hark to the foes of all things free, Who, arm'd in hate, intone: ‘The Union! let our war-cry be That word, and that alone! ‘The Union! Kiss the dead Christ's face While brandishing the Sword, Foster the scorn of race for race, Exult, and praise the Lord! Carry the rule of pride and hate O'er earth, from pole to pole! The Union! leave men desolate But keep the Empire whole!’ ‘The Union? Yes, in God's name, still The Union!’ we reply— ‘The Union of a Nation's will Against each timbrel'd lie! The Union beautiful and good Of lands by Love made one! One heart, one cause, one brotherhood, One Empire 'neath the sun! ‘That Union which hath been so long Our boast from sea to sea,— Justice, redressing human wrong, Love, keeping all men free; Not that which starves one hapless land While others smile full-fed, Not that which from another's hand Would snatch the daily bread! ‘Union in strength of Love, not Hate! Union in Peace, not Strife! Union to keep inviolate The sacraments of Life! Union is one great common aim, Triumphant late or soon, To share the freedom we proclaim With all who beg the boon! ‘Not Union based on braggart's boasts Or on the robber's creed, Not Union thrust by armed hosts On lives that would be freed! Not Union fed by hate and wrath Where'er the weak make moan,— No, Union on the heavenward path Where Justice hath her throne! ‘Justice to all, and first to those Who speak our common speech— Help to our brethren great or small, Free thought, free laws, for each; Who chains his brother to his side Seeketh his help in vain, And Might is impotent to guide The souls that Love may gain. ‘This is the Union which is still Our strength from sea to sea— Freedom, whose mandates we fulfil By leaving all men free To sheathe the sword, to help man's lot, To break each cruel chain . . . The Union? Yes, by God!—but not A pact 'tween Christ and Cain!’ ‘PEACE, NOT A SWORD.’ (The Arbitration Treaty, January 1897.) I Peace, not a Sword! She claims to-day The crown by Freedom wrought,— Victorious Peace, with power to sway Free Life, free Speech, free Thought; The Lord who gave the blind Seer sight Hath led us up and on, And lo! our Milton's dream of Light Fulfil'd, at Washington! II In this great hour of righteous pride, Be hush'd, ye Voices vain, Which still invite the Crucified To join the feasts of Cain; Not by the hypocrite's despair Shall Love's last gift be priced, Nay! Cain is Cain, although he wear The livery of the Christ! III Now, while ye greet your Jingo-god, Hounds of the mart and street, We close the bloody winepress, trod By fratricidal feet! The strife which savage priests have sung A thousand years shall cease, For Glory's banner shall be hung In the great Halls of Peace. IV Despair not, Men, though Time should bring But part of all ye crave: Did not the cry of Hampden ring As far as Lincoln's grave? The voice which saith, ‘No brother's hand May shed a brother's blood,’ Shall grow till men in every land Are one vast Brotherhood! V Lo, now the seed by martyrs sown Springs up, a goodly tree, Let every Despot on his throne Take heed, from sea to sea! For he who still invokes the Sword Shall by that same Sword fall, While he whom Wisdom's Voice and Word Redeem, must conquer all! VI Ring out, glad bells! now night hath fled, The rose of Dawn shall bloom! The Light that halo'd Whitman's head Shines back on Shelley's tomb! Under the bloodless Flag we stand Which martyr-bards unfurl'd, Heart link'd to heart, hand join'd to hand, The Freedmen of the World! 12th January 1897. HARK NOW, WHAT FRETFUL VOICES. Hark now, what fretful voices Sound shrill from shore to shore!— The home-bred curs of England Barking at England's door,— The weak wolf-hearted creatures Who gather multiform And out of quiet waters Would fain shriek up the Storm! Hark, how the half-breed answers With strident harsh refrain, Echoed by Windmill-Journals That whirl yet grind no grain— Out o'er the peaceful waters The hideous notes are hurl'd, While poets of the banjo Defy the listening world! Not thus in days departed Did England's triumphs come— The Hero then was silent, The Martyr then was dumb! Amid the roll of tempests You heard no rowdy's song— The Makers of our England Were still as they were strong! Not thus the sons of England Grew strong and great and free, Bridling the white sea-horses That sweep from sea to sea,— With stern lips set in silence They paused and bent the knee, And prayed the God of Silence To give them victory! The mighty hand of England Should be too strong to raise The trumpet of the Braggart That sounds her own self-praise! Her glory (still she gains it From sleepless year to year) Is wrought through deeds of Heroes, Not shrieks of Chanticleer! Out there upon the waters Heroes are living still,— From land to land they wander With firm and fearless will; They plough the stormy billow, But vaunt not what they do,— The Mariners of England Are calm as they are true! Yonder our legions gather Beneath the battle-flag, They march to Death in silence And let the coward brag; To urge their spirits onward They need no savage song,— The Warriors of England Are still as they are strong! And still, erect and fearless, Unarm'd or sword in hand, Wherever Honour beckons Our silent Heroes stand: They scorn the shrieking remnant Who gather multiform And, safe from every danger, Would fain shriek up the Storm! THE IRISHMAN TO CROMWELL. I Cromwell, what soul denies thy claim To honour in the Saxon's sight? Thy spirit, like a stormy flame, Still gleams through centuries of Night, While Freedom's weeping eyes are bent On deeds that are thy monument! II Thanks to thy ruthless sword and thee Thy cruel creed is living yet, And Christians still from sea to sea Owe thee and thine a deathless debt; With thee to light them through the land, Famine and Faith walk'd hand in hand. III Think not we scorn thee,—thou wast strong! Think not we wrong thee,—thou wast great! Thou sharest with the kingly throng The aftermath of human Hate: Among the thrones thy lightnings rent Should surely be thy monument? IV Hot gospeller of bloody War, Thy Cross became a slaughtering sword; Thy Biblic thunders roll'd afar The message of thy King and Lord,— The wondering Nations heard thy cry— ‘Worship my God of Wrath, or die!’ V Before thee, Tyrant, tyrants fell, By thee, O King, a King was slain,— Honest as Cain and true as Hell, Scorner of mercy, thou didst reign; With blood and tears thou didst cement This Union, thy monument! VI Thy Throne was on a million graves, O Christian monarch of the free; The curse of sixty thousand slaves, Torn from their homes and chain'd by thee, From the plantations of the west Arose, thy might to manifest! VII Even thus on History's bloodiest page Thy name is written, King of men,— And evermore from age to age Thy seed of bigots springs again; What needst thou further to content Thy ghost, by way of monument? VIII The bigot's strength and faith were thine, The bigot's creed that hates the sun, And yet in Freedom's name divine Thy bloody victories were won: 'Mong Monarchs keep thy place of pride, With Charles's Spectre at thy side! IX Ask not the love our souls deny, But take our homage if thou wilt,— Thy gospel was a living lie, Our blood was on thine altars spilt,— Scourge by the God of Slaughter sent, Be Drogheda thy monument! THE WEARING OF THE GREEN. (NEW STYLE.) ‘O what's the news from England?’ the grey old Mother said, ‘And what's the news about my sons, and are they quick or dead? I've waited on for many a year and prayed beside the sea, Remembering how they drew the sword and swore to set me free!’ ‘O Mother, sure thy sons survive, tho' better they had died, They palter with the faith they learn'd before they left thy side; Among the camp fires of thy foes the Fratricides are seen, They hang upon the Tyrant's nod, and blush to wear the Green!’ ‘My eyes are dim with weeping,’ the grey old Mother said, ‘The chains are still upon my hands, the sackcloth on my head; I blest my sons before they went and deem'd them leal and true, And eagerly with leaping hearts across the seas they flew.’ ‘O Mother, what was sown in pride thy sons now reap in scorn, They help'd the pandars and the priests to slay thine Eldest-born, Then for his raiment casting lots they reached out hands obscene, Dishonouring the noble dead who best had loved the Green!’ ‘Green be his grave in England, who loved me long and well, May never freemen welcome back the butchers of Parnell! I deem them sons of mine no more, I brand them sons of Cain, Who slew their brother over there, the bigot's smile to gain!’ ‘O Mother, sure not all thy sons are false and base like those, Not all have traded truth and faith to win the English rose; Among thy children over there are some whose hands are clean, And these shall yet unbind thy chains, and glorify the Green!’ ‘O what's the news from England?’ the grey old Mother cried, ‘Now he is slain, my Eldest-born, who stands as chief and guide? What souls are false, what souls are true of all that bear my name, What son of mine shall lift me up and save me out of shame?’ ‘O Mother, sure they follow now the feeblest of thy clan, A peddler with a woman's heart, and not an Irish man! And in his train the turncoat and the sycophant are seen, And day by day dishonour comes to those who wear the Green! ‘And over there in England, the Saxon who had sworn To break thy bonds and set thee free has laughed thy woes to scorn; For in the City's Square they raise a likeness hewn in stone To honour him who broke thy heart and left thee here alone! Mother, remember Drogheda, and all thy woes of old, And curse the butcher Cromwell's name a thousand thousandfold, Trust not the slaves that honour him who thy worst scourge has been, But turn again from friends so false to those who wear the Green! ‘We are the sons who love thee, O Erin, Mother dear! We've borne thy Cross and blest thy name from weary year to year! We've shamed the fratricidal crew who take thy name in vain, We've fought for Ireland foot by foot although our Chief lay slain; There's hope for thee and Freedom yet, so long as we are true, Our birthright still remains to us although our ranks are few,— Please God we'll save our country yet, and keep its record clean, And preach from Cork to Donegar the wearing of the Green!’ VICTORY. Old Flag, that floatest fair and proud Where'er our swift fleets fly, Do they who shriek thy praise aloud Honour thee more than I,— Who yield to none beneath the sun In love for thine and thee, Altho' I raise no song of praise Or hymn of victory? Not love thee, dear old Flag? not bless This England, sea and shore? O England, if I loved thee less My song might praise thee more,— I'd have thee strong to right the wrong And wise as thou art free; For thee I'd claim a stainless fame, A bloodless victory! Conquer'd thou hast! from west to east, Thy fleets float on in pride,— Thy glory, England, hath not ceased Since Nelson bled and died; Peace to the brave, who to thee gave This Empire of the Sea,— Yet would thy son from God had won A mightier victory! The trumpets of thy rule are blown Where'er thy hosts go by; Blent with their sound I hear the moan Of martyr'd men who die; Crush'd 'neath their tread lie quick and dead, And far away I see The white Christ rise with weeping eyes To mourn thy victory! Nay, is it victory at all The blood-red wreath to gain? The hosts who curse thee as they fall But prove thy glory vain; Thy legions strong still march along And reap the world for thee, But nobler is the Sower's song Than their best victory! Not through thy legions arm'd to slay Hast thou survived and reigned,— Through men who threw the sword away Thy glory hath been gained; Strong, stubborn-kneed, they stood and freed The slave from sea to sea, And Wilberforce's bloodless deed Was England's victory! The men whose hands have raised thy throne, And guard it evermore, Are such as lit the Eddystone And built the Skerryvore! By blood unstain'd their hands maintain'd This Empire of the Sea,— The white wreath won by Stephenson Crown'd Nelson's victory! To such as these, O Motherland, Let thy red hosts give room— To those who wrought with patient hand The engine and the loom; Thy gifts increase through acts of Peace, Not deeds men weep to see, And Shakespeare's page from age to age Is thy best victory! Not love the dear old Flag? not bless Our England, sea and shore? O England, those who love thee less May stoop to praise thee more. To keep thy fame from taint of shame I pray on bended knee, But where the braggart mouths thy name I hail no victory! Thy place is yonder on the Deep That blows thy fleets abroad, Thy strength is in the men who keep Their bloodless pact with God; They love thee best who will not rest Until, from sea to sea, Justice and Love, by all men blest, Complete thy victory! VOX POPULI. I How long, O God, how long shall we, The chosen of Thy race, Wail in the night for Light to see The glory of Thy Face? How long shall Death usurp Thy throne, While clouds of sorrow gather? Hearken, O God! Thy children moan In darkness for their Father! II How long shall this foul Upas-tree, Hung with the butcher'd dead, Cast on Thy Cross of Calvary Its shadow dark and dread? As high as Heaven its branches rise While those black fruits swing under, And yet no Hand from yonder skies Tears the black boughs asunder! III How long into our lives shall eat The leprosy of Lust, While all things pure and fair and sweet Turn into strumous dust? Crush'd 'neath the Leper's conquering feet Crouches the white Slave, Woman, While silently from street to street Glide hucksters of the Human! IV Under Thy Cross the Throne still stands, A Woman sits thereon; Beneath her cling with feeble hands Her brethren, woe-begone; No help, no succour from on high, To bless their souls bereaven . . . My God! they drag them thence to die, While Thou art dumb in Heaven! V The Atheist and the Priest, O Lord, Unite to forge our chains! Under Thy Cross, arm'd with Thy Sword, Judge Ananias reigns! Thy Priests stand by and make no sign, Thy Church lies mute and broken, And that they know no Light Divine Thy Gallows stands for token! VI Reach out Thy Hand, snatch back Thy Sword! God of the quick and dead! Crush down these Upas-trees, O Lord, To dust beneath Thy tread! Each leaf of life that trembles there, Withering broken-hearted, Attests, despite a Nation's prayer, Thy glory hath departed! VII How long shall Man's dark law abide And Thine be closely seal'd, How long shall Truth and Mercy hide Forgotten, unreveal'd? See, o'er this Flood whereon we move Burns War's red Bow of Slaughter! And still no sign of Thy White Dove Upon the crimson water! VIII Come from the darkness of the Deep, Open the Heavens up there, We charge Thee, by these tears we weep, And by these chains we bear! Death rules Thine earth despite our cries, Heaven's Throne, too, is assailèd,— While from His stricken children's eves The Father's Face is veilèd . . . How long, O Lord, how long? VOX DEI. I Cowards and Slaves, who ne'er will learn Your own deep strength and might, Who shut those eyes which should discern The Truth, the Right, the Light! God helps not Man, who might control Ev'n God to his endeavour!— The Titan with a Pigmy's Soul Remains a Pigmy ever! II So long as those who might be free Crouch down and hug their chains, In vain is their appeal to Me Or any God that reigns; So long as mortal men despair, Self-martyr'd, self-polluted, Those Upas-trees shall cloud the air With branches human-fruited! III So long as freemen yield the Thief Their birthright of the soil, And let my earth remain in fief To Knaves who will not toil; So long as Knaves by Slaves are sent To rule my fair creation, Wail on, ye Mortals, and lament Your own self-immolation! IV Awake! arise! upraise your eyes, Ye Titans of mankind,— One touch would break the chain of Lies Which ye yourselves have twined! 'Tis you alone who are the Strong, Not ev'n your God is stronger!— Long as ye will, be Slaves,—so long! But not one heart's-beat longer! V I made you free, I gave you might To lose or conquer all; I help no coward in the fight, But calmly watch him fall! So long as ye forget your dower, By your own wills bereaven, Wail on, in impotence of power, But hope no help from Heaven! . . . So long, O Men, so long! OLD ROME. Old Rome, whose thunderbolts were hurl'd So long across a wondering world, Whose legions swarmed from east to west, Whose eagles kept the storms at bay, Now Time hath lull'd thy heart to rest, Where is thy pride, O Rome, today? . . . Thy heart is still, Old Rome, thy pride hath pass'd away! Mount Atlas rises as of yore; All round upon the Afric shore The vast and solitary stones Of thine imperial Cities stand— The mighty Monster's bleaching bones Half-buried in the desert sand! . . . Where are thy conquering eyes, O Rome, thy red right hand? The sleepless Eagle's eyes at last Are closed, its sunward flight hath pass'd! But lo, afar across the sea This new imperial Rome doth rise, As strong, as fearless, and as free, It feels the sun and fronts the skies . . . Thine ears are dust, Old Rome, and cannot hear its cries! Dust! and we too, who now adjust Our pomp and pride, shall be as dust! And this, our Empire, too, shall share The same inevitable doom,— Thy death, Old Rome, and thy despair, With all the weary world for tomb;— The new race comes, the old and worn-out race gives room! With bread and pageants we appease The home-bred mob, while o'er the seas, Snatching the spoil of many lands, Conquering we sweep with sword and fire, Nay, building up with bloody hands The glory of our heart's desire,— Raising (like thee, Old Rome!) our own proud funeral pyre! Thy pride hath pass'd, and ours shall pass! Over our graves shall grow the grass, Within the cities we upraise Jackal and wolf shall make their home, A younger brow shall bear the bays, A fairer fleet shall face the foam,— When this our Rome is dust and laid with thine, Old Rome! THE LAST BIVOUAC. At hush of night, when all things seem To sleep, I waken and look forth, And lo! I hear, or else I dream, The tramp of Legions o'er the earth! And in the dark Hush'd heavens I mark Sentinel lights that flash o'erhead From lonely bivouacs of the Dead! Then, while the spectral Hosts sweep by, Unseen yet heard in the under gloom, I see against the dim blue sky A Skeleton in cloak and plume; Beneath him crowd, Like cloud on cloud, Sleeping on that great plain of dread, Dark countless legions of the Dead. No sound disturbs those camps so chill, No banner waves, no clarions ring,— Imperial Death sits cloaked and still With eyes turned earthward, listening To that great throng Which sweeps along With battle-cry and thunder-tread, To join the bivouacs of the Dead! Sentinel-stars their vigil keep! The hooded Spectre sitteth dumb, While still to join the Hosts asleep The Legions of the Living come: 'Neath Heáven's blue arch They march and march, Ever more silent as they tread More near the bivouacs of the Dead. But when they reach those bivouacs chill Their cries are hush'd, their heads are bow'd, And with their comrades, slumbering still, Silent they blend, like cloud with cloud: Light answers light Across the night,— While quietly they seek their bed Among the watch-fires of the Dead! And night by night the Leader's form Looms black' gainst heavens cold and dim, While evermore in silence swarm The human Hosts to rest with him; Hush'd grow their cries, Closèd their eyes, Silent until some trumpet dread Shall wake the Legions of the Dead! Thro' the Great City. THE FAIRY QUEEN. On the silent Bridge, at dead of night, I met the Fairy Queen,— I knew her well by the elfin light In the depths of her woeful een. Tho' the robe she wore was ragged and rent And her form was bent and old, Her hair in the gleam o' the gas was sprent With glimmers of fairy gold. ‘What makest thou here in the streets of Rome?’ And softly answer'd she: ‘Hungry and cold on the streets I come, Keeping my Jubilee! ‘The crown I wore in the days of old I have pawn'd in the Mart,’ she said, ‘And I sell my kiss for a piece of gold To buy my little ones bread! ‘They drove me out of my happy home Under the greenwood tree, And now I serve in the streets o’ Rome The Lords of the Bread!’ said she. I lookt in her face and methought I dreamed— She looked so weary and worn! So like a painted woman she seem'd Who in Fairyland was born! ‘Thy sisters and brethren, where are they?’ ‘They are slaves of the Mart,’ she said, ‘For a crust or a blow, be it night or day, They serve the Lords of the Bread! ‘And it's O for the gladness that once we knew, For the Dance and the Dream,’ said she, ‘For the soft moonlight and the morning dew And the glamour of Faërie!’ Weary and worn through the shadows grey The weariful creature fled, And I clench'd my hands as she vanish'd away, And curst the Lords of the Bread! THE LORDS OF THE BREAD. I ‘Lords of the Bread and the Land, Cruel and empty of heart, Low at your footstool we stand, We who are Slaves of the Mart! Ye have conquer'd the Earth and the Sea; In glory of purple and gold Your Empire rolls onward, but we Stand bleeding and bare as of old; Ye have stolen the soil of our birth, With the flesh of our bones ye are fed,— Who made ye the Masters of Earth? Answer, ye Lords of the Bread!’ II And the Lords of the Bread replied: ‘Hush, ye vain voices, be still! With the God of the Strong for our guide We have triumph'd and fatten'd our fill; And lo! in our pride we upbuild These Cities that look on the foam, And the waves of the waters are stilled And rock 'neath the grain-ships of Rome; And from City to City march forth Our legions with conquering tread: Ye made us the Masters of Earth, And the fulness thereof, and the Bread!’ III Then answer'd the Slaves of the Mart: ‘Even so! ye are great, ye are strong! But wherefore, O cruel of heart, Deny us our birthright so long! We launch'd ye these ships on the waves, We plough'd both the Earth and the Deep, And all that we ask for, your Slaves, Is tithe of the treasure ye keep. Ye have stolen the soil of our birth, Your beasts with our harvests are fed,— We made ye the Masters of Earth, And left ye the Lords of the Bread!’ IV The Lords of the Bread spoke again: ‘Lo, this is the Law,—so take heed,— Who gains shall inherit his gain, Yea, he and his uttermost seed! With the Sword of the Strong in our hand We keep what was stolen of yore, For lo! we inherit the Land, And ye can inherit no more— Behold we rejoice and make mirth, Though the mouth of the fool gapes unfed, For we are the Masters of Earth, And the fulness thereof, and the Bread!’ V Then answer'd the Slaves of the Mart: ‘O traitors, O wolves in the fold, The blood ye have wrung from the heart Ye coin into drachmas of gold; And the gold buys our sisters and wives, And our children are sold for the same, While ye stand on the wreck of our lives Rejoicing, and trumpet your fame! Accurst be this Land of our birth, And woe to this Empire,’ they said, ‘If ye, the proud Masters of Earth, Deny us our birthright of Bread!’ LAST NIGHT. Last night, as in the streets of stone I paced in silence and alone, A pale thin youth with locks of flame Came to me, murmuring my name. His face was white, his eyes were wild, He looked into my face and smiled, He named my name, then softly said, ‘I am thine other self, long dead!’ And as he spake I felt his breath Was chilly with the dews of Death, But suddenly he sang, and lo! 'Twas an old song I used to know. Ah, God! the music tore apart The clammy cerements of my heart, And suddenly I seemed to be Wild, young, and wonderful as he! And when he ceased, he laugh'd and cried, ‘Tho' all have perished, I abide,’ Yet looking in his face I knew 'Twas glittering with churchyard dew! I reach'd out hands and would have pressed The gentle vision to my breast, But from my touch, before I wist, He sprang and vanished into mist! ‘Come back, come back!’ I cried in pain, But ah, he would not come again! Tearful, in silence and alone, I paced along the streets of stone. THE SPHINX. (On the Thames Embankment, London.) I. A little gloved hand on my arm, a tall slight form beside me, After the supper at Rule's, on a balmy night in June, Whither in all the world should God or the Devil guide me But down to face the Sphinx, in the light of the summer moon! Not on the desert sands, with lions roaring around her Seeking their timid prey in pools of the bright moonrise, But here, by the glimmering Thames, in silence of dreams profounder, Crouches the Shape of Stone, wingèd, with wondrous eyes! Puffing my cigarette, I look on her marble features, Dead, stone dead, and looming pale in the starry light, While, flitting silently round, creep desolate human creatures, Carrion-seeking women, woeful waifs of the night,— Fading swiftly away as the slow policeman comes nearer, Stolid, silent, and tall, with measured ominous tread. . . . Hush! he is gone like a ghost! the light falls brighter and clearer On the wingèd Shape of the Beast, on the ringleted Woman's Head, On the dead dumb eyes still gazing, not on the City before them, Not on the moonlit streets, but on something far away,— Heedless of Earth around, of the patient Heavens o'er them, Heedless of Life and Time, dead to the Night and the Day! II. Clari, my sweet, you shiver? Nay, but the night is chilly! . . . Fear not the fabled Sphinx, but look in her rayless eyes,— Tiptoe, clinging unto me, frail and white as a lily, You face the Sphinx at last, with a maidenly mute surmise! Older than Night and Day, older than Death, she remaineth! Still, tho' New Rome is astir! Calm, tho' the Tempest complaineth! Ancient of days she was crouching like this ere Christ was created! Watching the things that are fled, seeing the things that are fated; Speechless, impotent, wise; pitiless, silent, and certain; Seeing some Shape that is stirring yonder beyond Night's curtain; Conscious, perchance, of the Sea of Eternity, blindly breaking Over this Rock of a World, on to the space without spheres. . . . We, too, look, but discern not!—yet ever, sleeping or waking, Fear the Sight she is seeing, shrink from the Silence she hears! III. Charm of the mystic Moonlight! Now, as the moonrays enfold you, You seem some lissome Queen, upgazing with a smile! With tiger-skin on your shoulders and fillet of dusky gold, you Witch the night with your mirth, on the banks of the yellow Nile! With armèd troops behind, this gloaming of golden weather, You lift your jewel'd hand, and lo! the trumpets play. . . . Ah, but the magic fades, and again, in bonnet and feather, You laugh, and merrily whisper, ‘Leave her, and come awal!’ IV. Nay, let me front the Sphinx for only another minute, Now when the city sleeps, and the River is mother-o'-pearl'd: Then hey for the hansom home, two lovers nestling within it, The joy of Night, and to-morrow, the rush of the waking World! V. Secret no mortal hath guessed, she seëth and knoweth for ever! Light no mortal hath seen, streams on her eyeballs of stone! Under her talon'd feet runs like a desolate river Life, and over her head Time like a trumpet is blown! Silent,—and we shall be silent;—lonely,—and we shall be lonely, Knowing what she hath known, seeing what she can see;— Dead,—and we shall be dead!—for our life and our love are only A dream in the Dream she dreameth, a drop in that infinite Sea! Even as Nineveh faded, even as Babylon perish'd, So shall this City depart, with all it hath shelter'd and cherish'd! Stone shall be cast upon stone,—grave upon grave shall be lying,— There, where the Magdalen wails, jackal and wolf shall be crying: Yet shall the River of Life wander and wander and wander, Yet shall the Trumpet of Time sound from the Sungates up yonder, Yet shall the fabled Sphinx brood on the mystic To-morrow While newer Cities arise, on the dust that is scatter'd in sorrow! VI. Dearest, 'tis long, so long, since out of the lonely abysses Crawl'd this fabled Sphinx, and moved among things of breath, Seeing the Sight Man sees not, feeling the Light Man misses, Turn'd to eternal stone, and brooded in dreamful Death— Cities have followed cities, nations have followed nations, Thick as the sands have vanish'd the tribes and the generations, God hath fallen on god, like statues of marble broken, Zeus hath gone like a cloud, Jehovah hath left no token,— And hush! who yonder is stealing, old and hoary and saintly, Holding in His thin hand a lamp that is flickering faintly?— Ghostwise on through the night, still loving thro' wholly despairing, Creeps the gentlest of all, to the grave of His kindred repairing! VII. Well! if the last word said, so long as our ears can hearken, Be this last word of Love (dear hand, how it creeps in mine!) Well, if the last God seen, ere the thrones of Eternity darken, Be the supremest and best, most human and most Divine? Is it not sweet to go, if He who is also going Beckons and bids us follow, ev'n to the empty grave? Better to rest beside Him, be done with seeing and knowing Than walk in a World bereft of the Spirits who heal and save! Ah, but in sad procession fast at His back they follow— Buddha, Balder, Menù, Prometheus, Phœbus Apollo: Shades, that follow a Shade; Gods, that obey a Supremer; Spirits of Healing and Light, Lords of the poet and dreamer, Leaving behind them only a world by despair overshaded, Only these eyes of the Sphinx, to mock us till we too have faded! VIII. Nay, then, by yonder blue Vault, with its million eyes gazing hither, Open and watching the world roll blindly no mortal knows whither, Nay, by those eyes more divine than any of stone, ever filling With drops of infinite Life, from the great heart of Nature distilling, God and the gods shall abide, wherever our souls seek a token, Speech of the Gods shall be heard, the silence of Death shall be broken, And Man shall distinguish a sign, a voice in the midnight, a tremor From every pulse of the Heavens, to answer the heart of the Dreamer! Faces of Gods and men shall throng the blue casements above him! Heaven shall be peopled with throngs of Spirits that watch him and love him! Out of the furthest Abyss voices shall call, while upspringing Man shall arise to his height, reaching hands up the darkness and singing,— Clouds of the Void shall part, with lights that throng brighter and faster, While blind as the grave the Sphinx lies low, 'neath the feet of her Master! IX. Close thine eyes, old Sphinx! we heed thy stare not a feather! Sleep in the summer moon, near the River mother-o'-pearl'd! And now for the hansom home, two lovers nestling together, The joy of Night, and to-morrow, the rush of the waking World! ‘THESE VOICES.’ These voices! Hark, Buchanan! All about thee, In the night-time, in the day-time, they are crying! Within thee they are sounding, yet without thee, Ever growing on thy sense, and ever dying! Sounds of weeping, sounds of jubilance and singing, Sobs of terror and of pain, and sighs of sorrow; And their echoes thro' thine inmost Soul are ringing, While thy soul looks forth in wonder night and morrow. Nay, but listen! . . . 'Tis the children's cry of gladness: Nay, but look! They smile with rosy faces hither! . . . But alas! the little shapes that sit in sadness, And the little broken lives that droop and wither! Hear the strong man in the dark for pity crying, Hear the foul man's word of hate as he goes by thee; Hear the shriek of trampled women, vainly flying From the phantoms that appal thee and defy thee! Ah, the Voices! and the Faces!—all the pity And the wonder, in this vision of the Human, All the lightness and the darkness of the City, All the beauty and the shame of man and woman! All the foul things God would seem to put His ban on, All the fair things that would seem to have His blessing— Without thee yet within thee, O Buchanan, They are thronging, with a riddle for thy guessing! Canst thou answer? Hath the living Soul within thee Any token, any beauteous explanation? Is it silent? Then Eternal Night shall win thee, And these Souls but knell thy Soul's annihilation! Shall these Voices die to one Voice,—thine upbraiding Of the power which brings and takes thee out of being? Shall these Faces fade to one—thine own face, fading Back to darkness, in the very act of seeing? Ah, the Voices! and the Faces!—wild and wan, on They are rushing, to destroy or to renew thee! Like a foam-flake shalt thou vanish, O Buchanan, If but one of these is lost that cry unto thee! THE CRY FOR LIFE. ‘Da spatium vitæ, multos da, Jupiter, annos! Juv., Sat. x. This was my Dream. Methought I stood Amid a crying multitude Who in this Rome awoke by night, And saw about them, shining white 'Gainst the great heaven's soot-black pall, An Angel with a sword. (Ye all, O brethren fashion'd out of clay, Have dreamed this Dream by night and day!) Loud (in my Dream) that host was crying For Life eternal and undying, And thus to still them as they cried, The pale Protagonist replied: ‘Silence, and listen for a space, Ye waifs and strays of human race, While I, God's herald from above, Whom ye name Death, and He names Love, Holding aloft the fatal knife Which cuts the crimson thread of life, Rehearse, to still your acclamation, The Master's last Determination!’ VOICES. Speak on, O scourge of Humankind, But veil thine eyes, that strike us blind! THE ANGEL. He who hath made you, frail or fair, Happy and innocent, or base, Hath given ear unto your prayer And pondered o'er it, in His place. And, firstly, He admits at once (What may be proved to any dunce) That when He breathed abroad His word To make Humanity, He erred! For know, to even Him is given Power to recant and to revise, And placing pigmies 'neath His Heaven To wail and curse and criticise, Was (by the sun and planets seven!) A hasty business and unwise! Yet ye, who by His dispensation Procreate also in your prime, Find irresponsible creation Pleasant to pass away the time! Results, however (and by these God judges both Himself and men), Have proved that doing what we please May lead to trouble now and then! This He perceives, and finding all His plans to make men worth the saving, End only in a caterwaul Of sin and strife and misbehaving, He thinks (whilst still apologising For that first blunder most surprising) That if He, in some moment weak Of pity, granted what you seek, It might perchance be just another Blunder, no better than the other! VOICES. Let us live on! Eternal Life We crave, though 'twere eternal strife; Let us live on, O Thou most High! For oh, 'tis terrible to die! THE ANGEL. O miserable things of clay! Do ye deserve to live? VOICES. Ah, nay! Not our desert, but our desire, Is the sole claim whereon we dwell— Lord, give us life, though in the fire Which burns for ever down in Hell! THE ANGEL. Alas! ye know (for men most wise Have opened up your close-shut eyes) Hell is a phantasy invented By pious gentlemen at prayer, Where all their foes may be tormented Whilst they themselves play harps elsewhere. Should ye live on, your lives must be Condition'd through Eternity By the same feelings, grave or gay, That animate your frames to-day. Wherefore the Lord, loath to refuse Your prayer, and fain to end the strife, Bids me make question how ye use The opportunities of life? If, being men, your aspiration Is worthy endless prolongation? Or whether (as our friend the Devil Argues) your plans, pursuits, and pains, Are so absurdly low of level, So little worthy things with brains, That 'twould be better, past a doubt, To let each little lamp go out? Speak then, all ye that look for ruth, What is the life ye fain would seize? Let God Almighty learn the truth, And don't speak all together, please! (Whereupon is heard a great clamour, after the subsiding of which individual voices make themselves faintly heard.) FIRST VOICE. I've lounged about barracks, I've danced and I've flirted, I bolted from Simla with Kitty Magee, And much as her fair reputation was dirtied By the cruel Divorce Court and nisi decree, I stuck to the lady and married her after, Returned to inherit dad's acres and pounds, Then treated the County (that cut us) with laughter, Till the Prince espied Kitty, when riding to hounds! After that all was smooth, and we entered Society, The clergyman called, and the County knelt down, And now life is full of eternal variety, 'Tween the fun in the shire, and the season in town! ANOTHER VOICE. With roguish face and pretty foot, Pink silken stocking, high-heel'd boot, And robes of Redfern's best, I sup at two, and rise at ten, Love all the white-shirt-fronted men, But the gay Guardsman best. Sing tra-la-la and rub-a-dub, I frisk at the Corinthian club With swells and ladies gay. I think this pleasant life and free Is just the life that ought to be For ever and a day! ANOTHER VOICE. For ever, for ever! I love the sweet rustle Of crisp new bank-notes, and the jingle of guineas— In the street, upon 'Change, 'mid the murmur and bustle, I pluck all the greenhorns, and wheedle the ninnies— Cent. per cent. is my motto! I blow the bright bubbles Which float for a while and then burst with no warning, And then take my holiday, tramping the stubbles, But get the Financial Review every morning. I've a brougham and buggy, a wife and a family, A dovecot at Fulham, a soiled dove within it,— When I dream of a coffin, my skin perspires clammily, And I don't want to think these enjoyments are finite! ANOTHER VOICE. I've plumb'd the great abyss of Mind And find no solid bottom there. Blind Force, blind Law are all I find, And dark progression God knows where! I've made a system most complete Of true philosophy, wherein I show all creeds are obsolete That seek some heavenly goal to win. And yet, Life's pleasant!—there's the rub With other fogies at the club, The Times at breakfast, and the knocks I give to notions orthodox In the Reviews! Tho' old and grey, And somewhat troubled with the gout, I really think I'd like to stay And see my theories worked out! ANOTHER VOICE. Even as my hand the pistol clutches, As the cold steel my forehead touches, I pause in act to fire, and crave Another chance beyond the grave! More life! more chances! here I first Drew breath, and knew the gambler's thirst, Lost every stake I had to play, And yet I know there is a way Had I but time! For pity's sake, Another life! wherein to stake My soul, in passionate despair, And win or lose it, then and there! VOICES. Yea, let us live! Eternal life We crave, tho' 'twere eternal strife! Let us live on, O thou most High, For oh, 'tis terrible to die! A VOICE. The light that never was on sea or land Fires and inspires me as I grip the pen,— That Novel of the Age, which I have planned, Must stagger and amaze my fellow-men. I crave for Fame! but most I want to beat That idiot Smith who boasts his tenth edition! Ars longa, vita brevis. Life is sweet, But far too scanty for the writer's mission— And Smith is famous, while I pine neglected! Almighty God, who makest reputations, Grant life, that Smith may hide his head dejected, While I am shining 'mongst Thy constellations! ANOTHER VOICE. 'Mong quiet woodland ways, remote From Demos of the clamouring throat And all rude sight and sound, I build my gentle House of Art Wherein my soul may sit apart Secure and lily-crown'd; While foolish martyrs feed the fire And angry factions rage, I twang the solitary lyre And scan the poet's page. The village maidens clean and trim Weave me green chaplets while I hymn God's glory and the King's; But o'er my grave and calm repose The gracious Muse of Rugby throws The shadow of her wings. Deep is my faith in Nature's plan, Mysterious and divine, To waken in the mind of man The peace which gladdens mine. Wherefore I crave eternal life, Remote from care, remote from strife, And innocent of wrong, That, loved and honour'd in the land, I still may cut with cunning hand My diamonds of song! ANOTHER VOICE. Thou hast set this crown of Empire on my head, Thou hast given me glory full and overflowing! The hungry people tremble at my tread, The widowed nations fear my trumpet's blowing. Leash'd in my grip, I hold the bloodhound War, But o'er my crown the Cross of Christ is looming, For in Thy name, O God, whence all things are, I wield the sword, cross-shapen, lifeconsuming! ANOTHER VOICE. To talk and talk! To spout for hours And have it printed all verbatim, While pressmen, wondering at my powers, Follow my prosings seriatim! Abuse or praise, 'tis all the same To make the politician's game, While o'er the long-ear'd listening nation Shoots the loose rocket, Reputation: The listening House, the long debate, The watching eyes, the Speaker's nod, Shall these depart? Forbid it, Fate! Make me immortal, like a God! These voices, and a thousand more, Like sad waves surging on the shore, Rose, broke and fell, while others came To fill the midnight with acclaim, Till, wearied out, the Angel dread Rais'd his right hand, and frowning said: ‘Enough, enough,’ and vanishèd. Whereon again uprose the strife Of those wild waves of human life, But in a little space once more His form flashed out against the sky; His hand was raised to hush the roar Of restless waters rolling by, And thus he spake, with lustrous gaze Fixed in large scorn on those who heard, Delivering to the World's amaze The Master's final Doom and Word! ‘Will it startle you much and be very distressing, If I say that the Lord, who is kindly tho' strong, Thinks that, tho' one or two might deserve such a blessing, Mankind on the whole are too mean to prolong? He harks to your pleading, He knows your petitions, But sees with a sigh what you are, and must be, And having made men of all sorts and conditions, He thinks He must trust them to Nature, and Me. Ipse dicit: the life you possess must content you, You'd waste for all Time what you waste for a day . . . Yet He leaves just a Doubt in your minds, to prevent you From letting the Devil have all his own way!’ SISTERS OF MIDNIGHT. (A NEW BALLAD TO AN OLD BURTHEN.) ‘One more unfortunate weary of breath’ (Sisters of Midnight, so runneth the ditty), ‘Rashly importunate, gone to her death,’ Lost in the gulf of the desolate City. Let the flood cover her, while we walk over her, Lit by the lamps of the Bridges forlorn— Sisters of Midnight, pale waifs of Humanity, Laugh at the world, all the foulness and vanity, Hunting your prey from the night till the morn! Poisonous paint on us, under the gas, Smiling like spectres, we gather bereaven; Leprosy's taint on us, ghost-like we pass, Watch'd by the eyes of yon pitiless Heaven! Let the stars stare at us! God, too, may glare at us Out of the Void where He hideth so well . . . Sisters of midnight, He damn'd us in making us, Cast us like carrion to men, then forsaking us, Smiles from His throne on these markets of Hell! Laugh! Those who turn from us, too, have their price! There, for the proud, other harlots are dressing, They too may learn from us man's old device— Food for his lust, with some sham of a blessing! Sons of old Adam there buy the fine madam there, Bid with a coronet,—yea, or a crown! Sisters, who'd envy the glory which graces them? They, too, are sold to the lust which embraces them, Ev'n in the Church, with the Christ looking down! Pure in their scorn of us, happy and fair, Let them go by us, contented and smiling— Foulness that's born of us, they, too, must share, Long as they welcome what we are defiling. They, who might turn to us, comfort us, yearn to us, They who still smile on the Man and his sin, Shut their proud portals of silver and gold on us! Sisters of Midnight, tho' shame comes tenfold on us, It comes twentyfold on those women within! Leprosy's taint on them falls (let it fall!), What we have poisoned, they clasp night and morrow! Angel or saint on them vainly shall call! Downward they drift to our level of sorrow! Laugh! The trade's flourishing, thanks to our nourishing! Pale droop the babes, while the mother's heart bleeds! Sisters of Midnight, God's good,—He avenges us! E'en as to dust and to foulness Man changes us, Back goes the sin to his innocent seed! ‘One more unfortunate, weary of breath,’— Plunge! down she drops, leaving sorrow behind her. ‘Rashly importunate, gone to her death!’ Spare her your pity, O fool, when ye find her! Stretch her out merrily, murmuring, ‘Verily, Luck, spite of all, falls at last to her share!’ Life has rejected her, let the gulf swallow her! Sisters of Midnight, make ready to follow her Down the deep waters of Death and Despair! THE LOST WOMEN. These are the Lost, waifs which from wave to wave Drift lone, while yonder on the yellow strand The laughing Children run from cave to cave And happy Lovers wander hand in hand. The sun shines yonder on the green hillside, The bright spire points to Heaven through leafy trees, The Maiden wears the glory of a Bride, The bright babe crows on the young Mother's knees. O happy Brides! O happy Mothers! born To inherit all the light that life can give, Hear ye these voices out of depths forlorn? Know ye these Lost, who die that you may live? A MORNING INVOCATION. (ON LONDON BRIDGE.) Shades of the clouds and the peaks! voices of rivers and fountains! Glimpses of purple crags and torrents that murmur and leap! Sounds and sights surrounding the Shepherd who stands on the mountains Lonely 'mong vapours of Dawn, dim like a vision in sleep. Dim he looms, and gigantic! Feels the chill breath of the Morning Creep thro' the whitening mists, blowing them silently past, Watches them come and depart, till out of the East with no warning Flashes a roseate beam, and smites them asunder at last! When lo! tho' clouds roll above and the sun is with shadows enfolden, The flocks are spilt on the hills, the torrents shoot to the fall, The eyes of the blue meres open, the moors grow purple and golden, The mists melt over the heights, and the great Day gladdeneth all! Shepherd of Song stand I here! and lo, the Night 'neath me and o'er me! Lone in the City I loom, and watch for the dawn of the Day! Shades as of clouds and of peaks, rising like phantoms before me, Darken around me to-night as they darken'd afar away. Dawn—and the shadows are stirr'd! Light—and the clouds break asunder! The River of Life again rolls by with a sound as of thunder! Spires of the City gleam, houses loom large in the grey light, Yonder a flag is flung out, yonder a casement shines clear, And lo! St. Paul's like a crag, rounded and dewy with daylight, Shines in the sun, while below it masts thick as reeds on a mere Rise from the dark-flowing Thames! Light of Humanity, filling The eyes and the ears with thy glory, this mystical dawning of Day! Touch the dark sources of prayer that stir in my bosom, distilling Dews from the darkness of sense, till the darkness melteth away! Come with the motion of clouds, with the murmur of winds come unto me, Open the glimpses divine, while Night like an owl taketh wing;— Shepherd of Song stand I here! Strengthen, inspire, and renew me To look on the pageant and live, to hear the world wake, and to sing! TO JUVENAL. ‘Prima fere vota et cunctis notissima templis Divitiæ, crescant ut opes, ut maxima toto Nostra sit arca foro.’ Juv., Sat. x. 23-25. Thy satire neither old nor stale is, Tho' many an age hath passed away,— Decimus Junius Juvenalis, Thou should'st be living here to-day! The God men still with prayer importune In every Christian temple stands,— To Plutus and his harlot Fortune We kneel with largess-seeking hand! Tho' eighteen centuries have departed This world of ours is just the same As when, O Censor single-hearted, You lookt on Life's Circensian game! Here is the City, as you drew it In those forgotten day of old! The mob of Remus, as you knew it When the slain Christ was scarcely cold! And Fame still tells the same old story Of idols whom the mob adore,— A little reign, a little glory, And lo, Sejanus topples o'er! The statue made of mighty metal Melts in the furnace, and alas! Mere basin, frying-pan, and kettle Are fashioned from the head of brass! ‘. . . Deinde ex facie toto orbe secunda Fiunt urceoli, pelves, sartago, patellœ!’ Juv., Sat. x. All power, all pride, are only trouble, Honour and glory cease to shine, Wisdom's a wig, and Fame a bubble, But Gold is evermore divine,— Minted tenfold it never ceases To gladden mortal days and nights, Surviving all the world's caprices And buying all the world's delights! No wonder, therefore, that we pray for it, Ev'n as ye Romans prayed of old,— Waving all other gods away for it, Selling our very souls for Gold;— The one glad thing that never stale is, The one thing sure when all is told, Is what you cursed, my Juvenalis, When the slain Christ was scarcely cold! LYDIA AT THE SAVOY. O my little Roman lady, with the fearless Roman air, Freezing up the strange beholder with thy calm imperial stare, Passing onward to thy carriage from the supper-table bright, While the other lissome ladies feast so merrily by night! With a gleam of chilly jewels and a rustling silken train Sweeping onward from the revel, full of delicate disdain, Proud and virginal and chilly to thy pointed finger-tips, Despite the splash of crimson on thy soft and scornful lips! But, my little Roman lady, how the gentle gods transform Thy beauty in the chamber where the lights are dim and warm, When thy sheath of silken splendour slips from nakedness divine, And a laughing little lady holds her rosy mouth to mine! O my little Roman lady! still remain as thou hast been, For the garish world a vestal, but for me the Cyprian Queen! Proud and virginal and chilly, till the Paphian charm is said, And the Cupids and the Graces gather laughing round thy bed! LESBIA. (TO CATULLUS.) ‘Lesbia, illa Lesbia, quam Catullus unam Plus quam se atque suos amavit omnes!’ Cat. Hundreds of years ago Your Lesbia lived and died Yonder in Rome; yet lo! Here she is at my side, Merry and wanton-eyed! Dead, yet ever re-born! Lost, yet ever found! Still with the roses of Morn And poppies of Midnight crown'd,— Laughing, with zone unbound! Still, my Catullus, here Her Paphian rites are done! Ever from year to year She gladdeneth in the sun, The wanton eternal one! Out of the ripe warm earth, After the death-cold snow, Bringing the old glad mirth The rose and the rose-girl blow— As in Rome so long ago! More than my eyes I love her, Just as you loved her there,— The same skies shine above her, And the same bright golden hair Flows on her shoulders bare! Light from her eyes I borrow, Clasp, kiss her, and adore;— Under the earth to-morrow She'll sleep as she slept before— Then waken and love once more. Tho' under the earth like thee I slumber still as stone, Roses will blossom, and she, The rose-girl, stand full-blown,— Laughing, with loosen'd zone! BICYCLE SONG. (FOR WOMEN.) I Changed in a trice you find me, Man, my master of yore! Vainly you seek to bind me, For I'm your Slave no more. Fast as you fly behind me, I now fly on before! II Out from my prison breaking, Wherein so long I lay, Into my lungs I'm taking Draughts of the glad new Day— Out! where the world is waking! Presto! up and away! III Praise to the Luck which sent me This magical Wheel I ride, For now I know God meant me To match Man, side by side! Wings the good Lord hath lent me, And oh, the world is wide! IV Scornful of all disaster, On to the goal I flee! My wheel grows faster and faster, My soul more strong and free! Pedal your best, good Master, If you'd keep pace with me! V Bees may hum in the clover, Sheep in the fold may cry, My long siesta is over,— Onward at last I fly— He who would be my lover Must now be swift as I! VI All that I missed he misses Who lags behind distressed,— Sweet were the old-time blisses But Freedom and Life are best— Still, there's a time for kisses, When now and then we rest! VII And now I heed not a feather The chains I used to feel— Soon in the golden weather, Edenward back we'll steal! Adam and Eve together! Throned on the Double Wheel! THE SHOWER. I. Suddenly, as the busy crowd Surges and roars along the street, Over the housetops broods the cloud, And down the first loose raindrops beat! While black umbrellas here and there Flutter up in the troubled air, With pitter-patter of many feet Into shelter the throngs retreat; In a moment the rush and roar Are still'd, and the Shower begins to pour, The eager Shower. with its twofold sound— The splash close by, and the murmur all round! II. Splash, splash! while the murmurous sound Gathers and deepens all around! And on the streets with leaden strokes Strikes the Rain, till the pavement smokes And where the great drops plash and pelt Quicksilver-rings are made and melt! While under the archways, at open doors, The wet folk gather, down it pours,— The eager Shower, with its twofold sound,— The splash close by, and the murmur around! III. And now . . . how quiet all things look! Still as a picture in a book! And lo! the crowding people seem Spell-bound, like figures in a Dream! Silently they shelter and stare On the rain-lash'd street, thro' the misty air:— Trembling the little sempstress stands, Holding her bandbox in her hands, Lifting her skirt and peeping down At her thin wet shoes with a shrug and a frown; The fop his silk umbrella grips, Holding it from him while it drips; The city man with impatient glance Looks at the clouded sky askance, Mutters, and quietly unfolds The evening newspaper he holds; The loafer leaneth against the wall, Straw in his mouth, with a grin for all; The urchin, reaching out his foot, Into the puddle dips his boot, Or cap in hand thrusts out his bare Head, that the drops may pelt his hair! 'Buses and cabs crawl slowly by, Glistering moistly under the sky; A mist steams up from the slippery ground, While louder and louder grows the sound— The splash close by, and the murmur around! IV. Then, all of a sudden, the air grows bright; The moist black pools flash back the light, The sun shines cheerily over all, And lo, the Shower has ceased to fall! The spell is broken, and now once more The crowd flows onward with busy roar! SERAPHINA SNOWE. I. Her Portrait. The medium, Seraphina Snowe, Hath come to town with her Spirit-show: A lady whom many a humbug think, Raised in the land of the bobolink; Has bothered philosophers many a day In the land of notions over the way; And over to England cometh she, Blown like a feather across the sea. A little lady with very white teeth, White high forehead, and underneath Eyes of strange forget-me-not blue Washed more pale by a dreamy dew; Lips rose-red and ever apart, Full of the pants of a passionate heart; Yellow and silken is her hair, With a gleam of blood-red here and there; As light, as bright, as a gleaming dove, Is the little lady the Spirits love! Hold her hand up to the light! How transparent, how waxen white, Save where the pink blood glimmers through! Observe the slight little body, too! A mingling, all tinted well, Of ‘Ariel’ and ‘Little Nell,’ With a spice of ‘Puck!’ With the wise men round her And the savants dying to confound her, She seems like some bright beautiful bird Singing to snakes—who think song absurd: Or a wave that breaks and sparkles and dances, While the dark rocks scowl, until each rock glances With the dew it scatters; or best, some hold, One of those spiders whose threads of gold Cross the woodland pathway, and (though so thin) The light and the dew and the glory win,— While close at hand with watchful wits, The lithe and luminous lady sits, Her body all beauty, her home all gay, And her two eyes waiting for common prey! II. Séance. Poor little spider, so soft, so white! What! doth she think in a web so slight To catch enormous insects like these, Or the critical wasps, or the busy bees? . . . Buzz! . . . in the silent séance you mark The wise blue-bottles hovering dark: Doctor That and Professor This, Each one finding the thing amiss, Seeking to learn the trick of the show. Poor little Seraphina Snowe! Hush! . . . How brightly she doth brood In the midst of us all, with the gentle blood All flown to her heart, and her face all hoar. Darken the room a little more! Is that the wind on the pane or the rain! . . . Something is stirring in my brain. . . . What is that? . . . . . . In the darkness of the room Her face grows up and fills the gloom Like a Lily of light. I feel her eyes, Tho' I cannot see them. My spirits rise And shiver—my heart ticks like a clock. O hush! O hush! was that a knock? Half a tap and half a creak, Partly bubble and partly squeak,— One,—two,—three! The room seems rising,—and still I see The gleam of the face. Strange raptures rain Thro' my blood, and my bones, and my bursting brain! She draws me nearer to her place, I seem to be coming face to face; She drinks my life,—her soft lips shoot Warmth to my spirit's uttermost root, Her glittering soul is in mine,—and hark! The sounds continue in the dark,— One,—two,—three! Break the charm! On the company Comes a scream like a spirit's in pain!— Something sweet dies out of my brain; And as lights are brought, great, yellow, and bright, There the medium sits so white Staring round with bewildered looks; And beneath her croucheth Doctor Snooks With a grin on his lanthorn jaws;—for he Has gript her delicate lissome knee, And holds the muscles as in a vice; And ‘Lo!’ he crieth, ‘in a trice I have stopped the raps; 'tis a muscular trick, And nothing more.’ Then, rising quick, He addeth, seizing his hat, ‘Good day! Madam, I wish you a wiser way Of gulling the public!’ Out they go, Reproachful, melancholy, slow; But still like a bird at bay sits she, Half in a swoon,—so silently Watching them all as they flit by With her pallid spectral eyes! . . . And I With eyes that burn and heart astir, Would linger behind and speak to her; But she waves me hence with a little scream, And out I follow in a dream, A haunted man; and when I meet The chuckling Doctor in the street, I pass him by with a bitter frown, And my hot fist burns to knock him down! III. The Gospel According to Philosophy. O eyes of pale forget-me-not blue, Wash'd more pale by a dreamy dew, O red red lips, O dainty tresses, O breast the breath of the world distresses! O little lady, do they divine That they hath fathom'd thee and thine? Fools! Let them fathom fire,—and beat Light in a mortar; ay, and heat Soul in a crucible! Let them try To conquer the Light, and the Wind, and the Sky! Darkly the secret forces lurk, We know them least where most they work, And here they meet and mix in thee, For a strange and mystic entity, Making of thy pale soul in sooth A life half trickery and half truth. Well? . . . O my philosophic friend, Does Nature herself ne'er condescend To cheats and shams, and freaks and tricks, Or doth she rather affect to mix Reason with revel? Are you certain That all is honest behind the curtain Of lovely things you rejoice to meet? Doth the Earth never sham, the Sky never cheat? And do we question and rebel If the cheat is pleasant and plausible? Do we growl at the Rainbow in the air, Or frown at the Mirage here and there? Nay, we take these things as they come, my friend, And let them into our being blend! Passive we yield to the Sun and the Light, To the scent of the flowers, to the sense and the sight, Taking all changes with souls serene . . . And so I take poor Seraphine! Beautiful mingling, tinted well, Of ‘Ariel’ and ‘Little Nell,’ With a spice of ‘Puck!’ True, as you aver, I never was a philosopher! But I do not envy Doctor Snooks His scientific tools and books, And I cheerfully let the grim old boy Dissect the humbug that I enjoy. Names,—more names? Let the lady be,— Fie upon your philosophy! And so the tricksy little bird Is a ‘grass widow’ (is that the word?) Or cast-off mistress, left to shame By a New York rowdy of evil fame. He thrash'd her did he? Go on. What more? Finish your story, and o'er and o'er, Proving things beyond human guess, Blacken the little adventuress. Now you have done, and I have heard, Patiently, every cruel word, Listen to me,—or rather, no! Why should I argue with you so, O wise Philosophy? Frown and go! . . . I turn to Seraphina Snowe! IV. Mesmeric Flashes. O eyes of pale forget-me-not blue, Wash'd more pale with a dreamy dew, What faces wicked, what haunts unclean, Have ye not in your wanderings seen! Poor little lady, so frail and wan, Bruised in the brutal embrace of Man! Thin white hands where the blood doth run Like the light in a shell held up to the sun, How often have ye lifted been To ward away from hands obscene Not a wicked touch but a ruffian blow! God help thee, Seraphina Snowe! Found out, exposed, the jest of the day, With thy spectral eyes on the world, at bay! While the sense of the Sun and the Wind and the Light Surge thro' thee, and leave thee more wild and white, And a mystic touch is in thy hair, And a whisper of awe is everywhere, And thou almost fearest in thy sin The spirits thou half believest in! Always imposing, little Elf, And most on thy delicate silken self! Making the raps with thy cunning knee, Smiling to hear them secretly,— And all the while thy pulses beat, Thou tremblest at thine own deceit, Listening, yielding, till there comes Out of thy veins, and out at thy thumbs, A wave of emotion, a swift flame Blanching thy spiritual frame To more ivory whiteness, a wild dew Washing the spectral eyes more blue— The secret Soul with its blinding light Confirming thee in thy lie's despite! Would to God that thou and I Might put our hands together and fly To some far island lone and new Where the sun is golden, the sea dark blue, Where the scented palm and the coca-tree Should make a bower for thee and me, And all should be wild and bright and keen, The flowers all colour, the leaves all sheen, The air and the warm earth all aglow With the life, the fever, the ebb and flow, With the spirit-waves that, flowing free, Foam up to a crest in Elves like thee! There, like the spider silvern and soft Spinning lits thread of gold aloft, Thou shouldst sit among the leaves and look Out at me from a golden nook; And draw me nearer with those dim eyes, And kindle thyself to pants and sighs, And I would crouch and gaze at thee Through life that would seem Eternity: While a wondrous spiritual light Flash'd through and through me so wild and bright, Till I faded away beneath thy hand, Through thy Soul, to the Spirit Land! MAETERLINCK. (After a Matinée of ‘Pelléas and Melisande.’) Why art thou dead, John Keats, not listening here To this faint melody from Shadowland? . . . The world dissolves, the Elfin groves appear, And naked in their midst young Love doth stand! Naked and wan, and, like a rose leaf, thin, With strange sad silver on his golden hair, He creeps o'er shadowy dew-soak'd lawns, to win Some fairy casement glimmering ghost-like there! The lights sink low, while sitting with no sound, Sunk in our shadowy stalls, we two recline— Frock-coated men and silk-clad ladies round, And thou beside me, Demi-vierge divine! The world dissolves, the garish streets are gone, Fled is the City's strident harsh unrest— Silent we watch the blind sad Love creep on With wet weak wings and piteous wounded breast! I cannot see thee, but my hand seeks thine,— And following Love's faint feet we steal away,— How shall I name thee, Demi-vierge divine, Morgan le Faye, or Blanche la Desirée? Ay me, the spell enwoven of woman's tears! The sound of kisses and soft madrigals! The forest path is haunted,—on our ears The warm melodious rain of Dreamland falls! And thin and pale and naked, side by side, We follow naked Love through woodlands wan; By all the wondering eyes of Elfland spied, We cling and kiss as ghostly lovers can! How shall I count our kisses in the dark? How shall I count our feverish words and sighs? Birds in a rain-wash'd nest, we cling and mark Love stealing sadly on with blind red eyes! . . . The music fades, the lights go up once more, Silk dresses rustle, murmuring voices sound, The spell of that lost Fairyland is o'er, But dreaming still we rise and look around! Then following with the crowd that seeks the light, Out to the garish street we pass again, And lo, thy face is glad and warm and bright, Redeem'd from Fairyland and all its pain! ‘How quaint! how odd! why, one would almost think We'd spent a chilly hour in some old tomb! No wonder people say that Maeterlinck Is Shakespeare's wraith, all creepiness and gloom!’ Sighing I stand and watch thee drive away, Smiling and nodding gaily as we part,— Morgan le Faye, or Blanche la Desirée, Changed to a modern maid without a heart! THE LAST CHRISTIANS I. ‘Storm in the Night.’ Storm in the Night, Buchanan! a Voice the night still crying, ‘They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where He is lying!’ Thou, too, singer of songs and dreamer of dreams, art weeping For the form that lay in the tomb, the Face so peacefully sleeping; And now He hath gone indeed, and His worshippers roam bereaven, Thou, by the Magdalen's side, art standing and looking at Heaven! Woe unto thee, Buchanan; and woe to thy generation! The harp of the heart He strung, the Soul He set in vibration, Are lost since He is lost, the beautiful Elder Brother; For the harp of the heart was His, the song could gladden no other! 'Twas something,—nay, 'twas much!—to know, though His life was over, That the fair, bright Form was there, with the wool-white shroud for a cover! He did not speak or stir, He did not hark to our weeping, But His grave grew wide as the World, and the stars smiled down on His sleeping. He made no speech, no sign, for Death has disrobed and discrown'd Him,— But the scent of spikenard and myrrh was sweet in the air around Him! So we kept our Brother, tho' dead! The Lily Flower of Creation! And to touch His dear dead hands was joy in our desolation. But now, the Tomb is void, and the rain beats over the portal: Thieves like wolves in the night have stolen the dead Immortal! So peacefully He slept, the Lily Flower of Creation, That we said to ourselves, ‘He dreams! and His Dream is the World's salvation!’ But now by the Tomb we stand, despairing and heavy-hearted; The stars look silently down, but the Light of the World hath departed. And yet, should He be risen? Should He have waken'd, to wander Out 'mid the winds of the night, out 'mid the Tempest yonder, Holding His Lamp wind-blown, while the rain-cloud darkens and gathers, Feeling His way thro' the gloom, naming our names, and our Father's? Nay, for the World would know the face of the fair New Comer, The graves would open wide, like buds at the breath of the summer,— The graves would open, the Dead within them quicken and blossom, And over the World would rain the flowers that had grown in His bosom! Nay, then, He hath fled, not risen! in vain we seek and implore Him! Deeper than Death He hath fall'n, and the waves of the World roll o'er Him! Storm in the night, Buchanan! A Voice in the night still crying, ‘They have taken away our Lord! and we know not where he is lying!’ II. ‘Hallelujah Jane.’ ‘He's a long way off, is Jesus—and we've got to make it loud!’ Glory! Hallelujah! March along together! March along, march along, every kind of weather! Wet or dry, shower or shine, ready night and day, Travelling to Jesus, singing on the way! He is waiting for us, yonder in the sky, Stooping down His shining head to Hear Our Cry! ‘'Alleloojah! 'alleloojah! Round the corner of the street They're a-coming and a-singing, with a sound of tramping feet, Throw the windy open, Jenny—let me 'ear the fife and drum— Garn; the cold can't 'arm me, Jenny—ain't I book'd for Kingdom Come? I've got the doctor's ticket for a third-class seat, ye know, And the Lord 'll blow His whistle, and the train begin to go . . . 'Alleloojah! How I love 'em!—and the music—and the rhyme— My 'eart's a-marchin’ with 'em, and my feet is beatin' time! Lift me up and let me see them—Lord, how bright they looks to-day! Ain't it 'eavenly? Men and women, boys and gels, they march away! Who's that wavin’? It's the Captain, bless his 'art! He sees me plain— It was 'im as 'ad me chris'en'd, called me “'Alleloojah Jane!” And the minute I was chris'en'd, somethink lep' in my inside, And I saw, fur off and shining, Golden Gates as open'd wide, And I 'eard the Angels 'oller, and I answered loud and clear, And the blessèd larfing Jesus cried, “You've got to march up 'ere!” And I march'd and lep' and shouted till my throat was sick and sore, Down I tumbled with diptheery, and I couldn't march no more!’ Glory! Hallelujah! Sound the fife and drum! Brother, won't you join us, bound for Kingdom Come? Wear our regimentals, spick and span and gay, And be always ready to listen and obey? Form in marching order, stepping right along, While above the angels smile and Join Our Song! ‘Are they gone? Well, lay me down, Jenny—for p'r'aps this very day The Lord 'll read the roll-call, so there ain't much time to stay. But afore I leave yer, Jenny, for the trip as all must take, Jest you 'ear me bless the music that fust blew my soul awake . . . I was born in dirt and darkness—I was blind and dumb with sin— For the typhus 'ad took father, and my mother's-milk was gin, And at sixteen I was walkin’ like the other gels ye meet, And I kep' a little sister by my earnin's on the street. Well, they say 'twas orful sinful, but 'twas all I'd got to do, For I 'ad to get my livin', and to keep my sister too; And poor Bess, yer see, was sickly—for she'd never been the same Since she got a kick from father on the back, wot made her lame;— As for mother, she was berried too, thank God! One winter night Been run over by a Pickford, when mad drunk, and serve her right! So we two was left together, and poor Bess, 'twas 'ard for 'er, For her legs was thin as matches, and she couldn't scursly stir; But so pretty! with her thin face, and her silken yeller 'air, And so 'andy with her needle, in her invalidy chair, And when at night I left her to walk out in street and lane, Tho' I come 'ome empty-'anded, she'd a kiss for sister Jane. But 'twas 'ard, and allays 'arder, just to keep ourselves at all, Me so precious black and ugly, Bess so 'flicted and so small, For tho' only one year younger, she'd 'a' passed for twelve or less; But, Lor bless ye, she was clever, and could read and spell, could Bess! (She'd learnt it at the 'ospital from some kind nuss, yer see.) When I brought 'er 'ome a paper she could read the noos to me, All the p'lice noos and the murders, and the other rum things there, And for 'ours I'd sit and listen by her invalidy chair! ‘Well, one night as I was climbin’ up the stair, tir'd out and sad, For the luck had been ag'in me, and 'twas pouring down like mad, I 'eard her voice a-screaming! and from floor to floor I ran, Till I reach'd our room and sor 'er, and beside her was a man, An ugly Spanish sailor as was lodgin' in the place, And the beast was 'olding Bessie and a-kissing of her face, And she cried and scream'd and struggled, a-tryin' to get free, And the beast he 'eard me comin' and turned round 'is face to me, And I sor it black and ugly with the drink and worse beside, And I screech'd, “Let go my sister!” while she 'id her face and cried. Then the man look'd black as thunder, and he swore he'd 'ave my life If I stay'd there, and his fingers began feelin' for his knife, But I lep' and seized a poker as was lying by the grate, And I struck 'im on the forrid (bet your life he got it straight— For I felt as strong as twenty!), and he guv an angry groan, Drew the knife, and lep' to stab me, then roll'd over like a stone! And the landlord and the lodgers came a-rushin' up the stair, While I knelt by Bess, who'd fainted in her invalidy chair! ‘Well, Jenny, no one blamed me!—and the p'lice said “Serve him right!”— I never saw his face ag'in arter that drefful night; But ever arter that poor Bess seem'd dull and full of care, And she droop'd and droop'd and sicken'd in her invalidy chair. Some trouble of the 'art, they said (that shock was her death-blow!) And I watched her late and early, and I knew as she must go; And the doctor gave her physic, and she'd all as she could eat, And I bought her many a relish, when I'd luck upon the street; But one mornin', close on Easter, when I waken'd in our bed, I turn'd and see her lyin’ with her arms out, stiff and dead! And I cried a bit and kiss'd her, then got out o' bed and drest, Wash'd her face, put on clean linen, placed her 'ands upon her breast, And she look'd . . . she look'd . . . so pretty! God was good! I'd luck just then— I scraped the money somehow, till I'd nigh on one pound ten, And I bought poor Bess a coffin, and a grave where she could lie— She got no workus berryin'—thank God for that, sez I! And the neighbours sor me foller, all a-gatherin' in a crowd, And I never felt as lonesome, but I never felt so proud! ‘Arter that, I sort o' drifted 'ere and there about the town, Like a smut blown from a chimbly, and a long time comin' down! And I took to drink like mother, and the drink it made me mad, So, between the streets and prison, well, my luck was orful bad! I was 'onest, tho', and never robb'd a man, or thief'd (not me!) Tho' they quodded me for fightin' and bad langwidge, don't yer see? And at last, somehow or other, how it come about ain't clear, I was took to a big 'ospital, and kep' there nigh a year, And I felt—well, now, I'll tell yer—like a bit of orange peel, All muddy and all rotten, wot you squash beneath your 'eel! Well, the doctors 'ealed and cured me, but one mornin', when they said I must go to a reformat'ry, sez I, “No, strike me dead!” And I felt a kind of loathin' for them all, and thought of Bess Lyin' peaceful there at Stepney in her clean white fun'ral dress. And I left the place next mornin'—I was wild, ye see, to go— And 'twas Christmas, when I trampled back to Stepney thro' the snow— And I met a chap who treated me and made me blazin' tight, And I lost my 'ed and waken'd in the streets at dead o' night, And the snow was fallin', fallin', and 'twas thick upon the ground, And I'd got no place to go to, and my 'ed was whirlin' round, When I see a lamp afore me, and a door stood open wide, And I took it for a publick, till they sang a psalm inside, And I sez, “It's them Salvationists!” and turned to go away, When one comes out, their Captain, and calls out for me to stay; And he touch'd me on the shoulder, and he sez, “Wot's up, my lass?” And I sez, “I ain't teetotal!” and I larf'd, and tried to pass, But he looked me in the face, he did, and sez, “Wot brings ye 'ere? Speak out if you're in trouble, and we'll 'elp ye, never fear!” And I sez, “I ain't in trouble!” but he looks me in the eyes, And he answers sharp and sudden, “Don't you tell me any lies— The Lord Jesus 'ates a liar!” and at that I shut my fist, I'd 'a' struck 'im if'e'd let me, but he ketch'd me by the wrist, And he whisper'd, oh, so gentle, “You're our sister, lass,” he said, “And to-night I think our sister 'as no place to lay her 'ed! Come in—your friends are waitin'—they've been waitin' many a day— And at last you've come, my sister, and I think you've come to stay!”’ Glory! Hallelujah! Fighting for the Lord! Sinners kneel before us, fearing fire and sword! Never you take service with the Devil's crew— Here you'll get promotion, if you're straight and true! Jesus is Field-marshal! Jesus, Heaven's King, Points us forward, forward, while we March And Sing! ‘Still a-playin’ in the distance! 'Allelujah! Fife and drum! 'Ere's my blessin' on the music, now I'm bound for Kingdom Come! Well, that night ?—They guv me shelter, and a shakedown nice and clean, And no one ax'd no questions—who I was, or wot I'd been— But next mornin' when I waken'd, with a 'ed that split in two, In there comes a nice old lady, and sez smilin', “How d'ye do?” And I nods and answers sulky, for “she's come to preach,” thinks I, But we gets in conwersation, and at last, the Lord knows why, I tells her about Bessy,—and I see her eyes grow dim, And outside, while I was talkin', sounds the loud Salvation 'ymn. “Well,” sez she, “she's gone to glory, and she's up among the Blest, For it's poor gels like your sister as Lord Jesus likes the best!” And from that she got me talkin' of myself, and when she 'eard All my story as I've told yer, up she got without a word, And she kiss'd me on the forrid! then she sez, “All that's gone past! And there's lots of life before you, now you've come to us at last!” Then I larf'd—“I ain't Salvationist, and never mean to be! Tho' a-prayin' and a-singin' may suit you, it won't suit me!” But she sez, “You just 'ave patience, for the thing wot's wrong with you Is just this—you're downright wretched, all for want of work to do! One so pretty should be 'appy as a bird upon a tree” (Me pretty! and me 'appy!) “for the Lord, my dear,” sez she, “Likes nice cheerful folks about Him, and can't bear to see them sad, For He's fond of fun and music and of everythink that's glad!” ‘Well, she got me work, and told me folks must labour every one, And I said I'd be teetotal (just to please her, and for fun!) But I allays hated working, and my 'eart felt dull and low, And thinks I, “The publick's better, and religion ain't no go,” For somethink black and 'eavy seem'd a-workin' in my breast, And I used to go 'ysteric, and I never felt at rest . . . But one mornin', when the Army was agatherin', I stood by, And they 'ollered, “Glory, glory, to our Father in the sky!” And I thought the tune was jolly, and I sang out loud and gay, And the minute I begun it, 'arf my trouble pass'd away, And the louder as I sung it, that great lump I felt inside Grew a-lighter and a-lighter, while I lep and sung and cried! And when the song was over, up the Captain comes to me, And he sez, “That voice of yourn, Jane, is as good as any three! Why, you're like a op'ry singer!” he sez, larfin'. . . . “Never mind,” He sez (for I look'd sulky, and his 'eart was allays kind!) “Never mind—there's many among us of such singin' would be proud— He's a long way off, is Jesus, so we've got to make it loud!” Then they march'd, and I went marchin', for I seem'd gone mad that day, And my 'art inside was dancin' every footstep of the way. Yes, and that there singin' saved me! for the louder as I sung, Why, the more my load was lighten'd, and it seem'd as how I sprung From the ground right up to Jesus, and I 'eard Him 'oller clear, “Keep a marchin' and a-singin', for you've got to get up 'ere!”’ Glory! Hallelujah! March along together! March along, march along, every kind of weather! Wet or dry, shower or shine, ready night and day, Travelling to Jesus, singing on the way! He is waiting for us, yonder in the sky, Stooping down His shining head, to Hear Our Cry! ‘Coming back? Ah, yes, I 'ear them, louder, louder, as they come; Lord, if I might only jine them, march ag'in to fife and drum! . . . I feels faint. . . . A drop o' water!—There, I'm better, but my 'ed Is a-swimmin' to the music. . . . Now it's stop't. . . . Wot's that ye said? They're a-standing 'neath the windy? Lift me up, and let me see, For the sight of them as saved me is like life and breath to me! No, I can't!—all's black afore me—and my singin's a'most done. . . . Now, it's lighter! I can see them! all a-standin' in the sun! Look, look, it's the Lord Jesus! He's a-formin' them in line, His white 'orse is golden-bridled, and 'is eyes—see, how they shine! 'E's a-speakin'! Read the Roll-Call! They're a-throngin' one and all, With their things in marchin' order, they're a-answ'rin' to the call, My turn will soon be comin', for the march must soon begin. . . . ‘Alleloojah Jane! That's me, sir! Ready? Ready, sir! Fall in!’ L'Envoi to the Preceding Poem. Nought is so base that Nature cannot turn Its dross to shining gold, No lamb so lost that it may never learn The footpath to the fold. Be sure this trampled clay beneath our feet Hath life as fair as ours, Be sure this smell of foulness is as sweet As scent of fresh young flowers. All is a mystery and a change,—a strife Of evil powers with good: Sin is the leaven wherewith the bread of life Is fashion'd for our food. God works with instruments as foul as these, Sifts Souls from dregs of sense, Death is His shadow—Sorrow and Disease Are both His handmaidens! Out of the tangled woof of Day and Night His web of Life is spun: Dust in the beam is just as surely Light As yonder shining Sun! III. ‘Annie;’ or, the Waif's Jubilee. ‘The magistrate asked her what she had to say for herself. “Only this, sir,” she replied, “I was a gentleman's daughter once.”’—Police Report. ‘Annie! Annie!’ Hark, it is Father's call! See, he is coming! Run To meet him, little one, In the golden evenfall. Yonder down the lane His voice calls clear: ‘Annie!’ he cries again— Run down and meet him, dear! The long day's toil is done, The hour of rest has come— Haste to him, little one— Ride on his shoulder home! . . . What voice is it she hears across the storm, The haggard Waif who stands with drip ping form Shivering beneath the lamps of the dark street? With slant moist beams upon the Rain's black walls The dreary gaslight falls, And all around the wings o' the Tempest beat! O hark! O hark! The voice calls clear i' the dark— She hears—she moans—and moaning wanders on; A mist before her eyes, A stone in her heart, she flies Into the rainy darkness, and is gone! What a Night! strong and blind Down the street swoops the Wind, Falls breathless, then moans! While again and again Like a spirit in pain, On the black slippery stones Sobs the Rain! . . . ‘Annie! Annie!’ Hark, it is Father's call! See, he is coming! Run To meet him, little one, In the golden evenfall! . . . Out from the darkness she hath crept once more, That strange voice ringing hollow over all; Close to the theatre's great lighted door, Where smiling ladies, while the raindrops pour, Wait for their carriages, and linkmen bawl. She pauses watching, while they laugh and pass Tripping across the pavement 'neath the gas, Then rattling home. Home? Ah, what home hath she, Who once was bright and glad as any there? Fifty years old, this is her Jubilee! And round her Life is like an angry Sea Breaking to ululations of despair! . . . Who hath not seen her, on dark nights of rain, Or when the Moon is chill on the chill street, Creeping from shade to shade in grief and pain, Showing her painted cheeks for man's disdain And wrapt in woe as in a winding sheet? Sin hath so stain'd it none may recognise The face that once was innocent and fair, And hollow rings are round the hungry eyes, And shocks of grey replace the golden hair; And all her chance is, when the drink makes blind The foulest and the meanest of mankind, To hide her stains and force a hideous mirth, And gain her body's food the old foul way— Ah, loathsome dead sea fruit that eats like earth, Her mouth is foul with it both night and day! So that corruption and the stench of Death Consume her body and pollute her breath, And all the world she looks upon appears A dismal charnel-house of lust and tears! Sick of the horror that corrupts the flesh, Tangled in vice as in a spider's mesh, Scenting the lazar-house, in soul's despair, She sees the gin shop's bloodshot eyeballs glare, And creepeth in, the feverish drug to drain That blots the sense and blinds the aching brain; And then with feeble form and faltering feet Again she steals into the midnight street, Seeks for her prey, and woefully takes flight To join her spectral sisters of the Night! What a Night! fierce and blind Down the street swoops the Wind! How it moans! how it groans! While again and again Like a spirit in pain, On the black slippery stones Sobs the Rain! See! like ghosts to and fro Living forms swiftly pass, With their shadows below In the gleam of the gas; And the swells, wrapt up warm, With their weeds blasing bright, Hurry home thro' the Storm . . . It's a Hell of a Night! Hell? She is in it, and these shapes she sees, While crawling on, are hateful and accurst! Light laughter of light lips, mad images Of dainty creatures delicately nurst, Cries of the revel, blackness, and the gleam Of ghastly lights, are blended in her dream Of Hell that lives and is, the Hell she knows, With all its mockery of human woes! Darkly, as in a glass, she seëth plain The vision of dead days that live again: The house, beyond these streets, where she was born; The father's face in death; the hungry home; The fight for bread; the hungry and forlorn Cry for a help and guide that would not come; The glimmer of glad halls, the forms therein Beck'ning and laughing till she joined their mirth; Then, pleasures sultry with the sense of sin, And those foul dead sea fruits that taste of earth; Then, blackness of disease and utter shame, And all Hell's infamies without a name! Then, all the bloom of sense and spirit fled, The slow descent to midnight gulfs of dread Like this she sees!—Then, in a wretched room Deep 'mid the City's sunless heart of gloom, Another life awakening 'neath her heart, A sickly babe with crying lips apart Moaning for food!—and into Hell she creeps Once more to feed it, haunting the black street,— Yea, in the garret where her infant sleeps Hell's hideous rites are done, that it may eat! Then, Death once more! The sickly life at rest; The child's light coffin that a child might bear; The mother's hunger tearing at her breast, And only Drink to drown the soul's despair. She sees it all, on this her Jubilee, While the Night moans and the sick Hell-lights gleam. . . . O God! O Motherhood! Can these things be, And men still say that Hell is but a dream? ‘Annie! Annie!’ What voice is this that cries Amid the lights of Hell, Where these live shadows dwell Under the rain-rent skies? . . . What a night! All one hears Is the torrent of tears On a world plung'd in pain; All one sees is the swarm Of dim waifs in the storm, Flitting hither and thither (O God, who knows whi ker?) Like ghosts, thro' the Rain! . . . Annie! . . . She hears the voice, ev'n while she crawls 'Neath the black arches on the riverside, Then moaning low upon her face she falls . . . Annie! . . . She stirs, and listens as it calls, With eyes that open wide. Lost there to Man, dead to the Storm and Strife. She lies and keeps her Jubilee till morn, O'er her, a heap of rags, the waves of Life Wash weary and forlorn . . . Is all, then, done? Nay, from the depths of Night That voice still cries, and dimly gleams a Light . . . ‘Annie!’—She listens —Thro' the Tempest wild One cometh softly—she can see him come!— ‘Father! I'm Annie! I'm your little child!’ And father lifts her up, to bear her Home! L'Envoi to the Preceding Poem. I. Courage, and face the strife of Humankind In patience, O my brother: We come from the eternal Night to find, And not to lose, each other! Think'st thou thy God hath toil'd thro' endless Time With ceaseless strong endeavour, To tashion these and thee from ooze and slime, Then blot His work for ever? Age after age hath roll'd in billowy strife On the eternal Ocean, Bearing us hither to these sands of Life With sure and steadfast motion Dead? Nought that lives can die. We live and see! So hush thy foolish grieving: This Universe was made that thou mightst be Incarnate, self-perceiving. Still thine own Soul, if thou wouldst still the strife Of phantoms round thee flying; Remember that the paradox of Life Is Death, the Life undying. II. How? Thou be saved, and one of these be los The least of these be spent, and thou soar free! Nay! for these things are thou—these tempest-tost Waves of the darkness are but forras of thee. Shall these be cast away? Then rest thou sure No hopes abide for thee if none for these. Wouldst thou be heal'd? Then hast thou these to cure; Thine is their shame, their foulness, their disease. By these, thy shadows, shalt thou rise or fall; Thro' these, and thee, God reigns, or rests down-trod: Let Him but lose but one, He loses all, And losing all, He too is lost, ev'n God. These shapes are only images of thee, Nay, very God is thou and all things thine: Thou art the Eye with which Eternity Surveys itself, and knows itself Divine! THE TRUE SONG OF FAIRYLAND. I. The bugle is blowing from elfin dells With a hark and a hey halloo! The dark clouds part as the music swells, And the Heaven where eternal summer dwells Shines bonnie and bright and blue! . . . A child I dwelt in the wild north-land, In a City beside the Sea,— The morning I slept on the yellow strand I had summers seven and three! Tired with playing on the sands so fair I slept in the white moon's beam, And the good folk found me sleeping there And twined me away in a dream! They wetted my lips with the honey-dew And my lids with the euphrasie, And I open'd my eyes beneath the blue Still Heaven o' Faërie! I saw the fields of the silvern grain And the hills of the purple sheen, And the King of Elfland with all his train Rode o'er the uplands green; I learn'd the spell o' the Elfin land And the songs the Pixies sing,— The woven charm of the waving hand That makes the Magic Ring! I heard what mortals cannot hear, The dew-wash'd blue-bells tinkling clear Under the starry skies, And the Fay-folk throng'd on the grassy ground, And the Kelpie swam in the burn, like a hound With great sad human eyes . . . They bore me back from the Land of Light To my sleeping-place by the Sea, But when I waken'd my face was bright With a golden glamorie! As I wander'd back on the ocean sand I sang full loud and free,— For the things I had seen in the Elfinland, And the swectness I could not understand, Had turn'd to a melodie! II. Lonely I dwelt by the sad sea-shore In a world of women and men,— When I lookt on the Spirits of Light once more I had summers seven and ten! They gather'd at night around my bed, All in the pale moon's beam, ‘Sing of the Fairy World,’ they said, ‘And the Dream within the Dream! ‘Sing, for a World that is weary and grieves, Of a World that is ever bright, Of the Spirits that hide among flowers and leaves And play in the starry Light! ‘Sing, for the hearts that are sad and old, Of the hearts that ever are young!’ And they set in my arms a harp of gold, And I wander'd forth,—and I sung. I sung my song by the cottage door And up at the lordly hall, And I wove the light of the magic lore With the love that is birthright of rich and poor And blesses great and small. Then into the City I singing pass'd And the walls closed round on me, Till the Cloud of the World shut out at last The Heaven o' Faërie! III. From lane to lane, from street to street, I walked for weary years, And a band of lead was around my feet And my song was still'd with tears. The smoke of the City above my head Shut out the starry sky, And the sounds around me were as the tread Of legions thundering by! And I tried to sing, but no song would come From my frozen lips of clay,— By the living Waters I wandered dumb And watch'd them rolling away! IV. Full many a year my heart was sore And the World grew dark to me,— When I heard the music I loved once more I had summers a score and three! There came a bird in the dead of night And sang and waken'd me, And I felt the beams of the Land of Light And open'd mine eyes to see! The clouds of the City were cleft in twain, The gleam of the skies shone through,— And voices from Elfland cried again With a hark and a hey halloo! The banners of Elfland waved on high, The streets were grassy green, Everywhere 'neath the starry sky The Fairy Folk were seen! The pale Fay-King with his golden crown Went by and beckon'd me, And troops of children followed him down To the sands of a crystal Sea;— And some were blind, and some were lame, And all were ragged and poor, And they flock'd and flock'd with glad acclaim, As he passed, from every door! And down to a silvern strand they hied And bathed in the water clear, And the King stood by them radiant-eyed While the Good Folk gather'd near. Back they flocked to the City cold, Between the dark and the light, And a gentle Shepherd with crook of gold Gather'd them into the dusky fold Like lambs wash'd clean and white! From the shining dove-cots overhead Whose doors swung open wide, The Fays of heaven took wing and fled Like doves in the eventide; And the Fays of the woods came thronging in, With the Fays of field and stream, And they filled the City of shame and sin With the sound of a summer dream! Have you heard the croon of a cushat creep Through the boughs of a leafy dell? Like the cushat's call, from the boughs of Sleep (Deep! deep! deep! deep!) The magic murmur fell! And the little children lay content While the Fays their vigil kept, And honeysuckle and hawthorn scent Blew round them as they slept! And ever the bugles of Elfland blew And the magic notes ran free,— The Heavens were open, the stars shone thro' With a golden glamorie! V. The bugle blows from the elfin dells With a hark and a hey halloo, And the magic song of the fields and fells Rings on beneath the blue! Be it rain or wind, be it shine or snow, I echo that song to men,— The fairies are with me still, altho' I have winters five times ten! The mist that floats before human eyes Hides the heaven o' Faërie, The cloud o' the sense around them lies, They are blind and cannot see; Yet the folk of Elfland are busy yet In street and alley and lane,— They dry the eyes that are weary and wet, And they beal the heart's dull pain! From door to door the Good Folk fly, With liberal heart and hand, And wherever the little children cry Is the light o' the Fairy Land. The little box of mignonette, On the window-sill of the sick-room set, Holds flowers the Fay-folk sow— The thrush in his wicker cage that swings In the smoky lane, laughs loud and sings A song the Good Folk know! They are with us yet, they are busy yet, They are here from night to morn, And they remember tho' we forget The land where the Light is born! At dead of night with a soft footfall Thro' the wards of the children's hospital They flock with light and song,— On the still white beds the moonlight lies, And the pale sick children open their eyes And see the shining throng. VI. The bugle blows from the elfin dells With a hark and a hey halloo! The Land where eternal summer dwells, The Land of magical songs and spells, Again shines bright and blue! Be it sun or snow, be it rain or wind, I echo that music here, Tho' my heart beats faint and my eyes grow blind And the wintertide is near. I hear the sound of a funeral bell Go thro' the World grown gray,— I hear the wise men ringing the knell Of a God that is dead, they say. I hear the weeping, I hear the groans, I see the mourners stir, I watch the sextons who heap the stones On the mouth of the sepulchre! But I only smile, for the Fays by night Make the day's long labour vain,— Legions from Elfland, laughing light, Open the grave again! When the gates o' the grave are openèd And the lambs sleep in the fold, The Fay-King arises, quick not dead, And the gleam of the moonlight is round his head, And his shroud is shining gold! He stands and smiles on the folk asleep, Yea, stoops and comforts them, But the men and women that sleep not, creep To touch his raiment-hem! And I hear his voice ring clear and mild Over the earth and the sea,— ‘Except thou be as a little Child, Thou shalt not come to Me!’ And I see the faces of old, old men Grow foolish and glad and young, And I hear the grandam crooning again The songs the Fays have sung; And men and women forget their care And cry like lambs in the night, For the King of Elfland finds them there, And the spirits of Elfland fill the air With dreams from the Land of Light; And the graves are open, and shining crowds Throng from the fields of Sleep, And we see our loved ones in their shrouds, That fall and leave them like breaking clouds, And we clasp their hands and weep! Yea, this is the work the Fay-folk do In the name of their gentle King,— Ah, well for men if they surelier knew The message the Good Folk bring! Alas for the life of ashes and sand, Alas for the World grown gray, If the gentle dream of the Fairy Land, The Light in the lattice of Heaven, the Hand That beckons, should fade away! Latter-Day Gospels. JUSTINIAN; OR, THE NEW CREED. ‘The world is weary of idolatries: Pan and Apollo and great Zeus are dead, And Jesus Christ hangs cold upon the Cross. Nay more, the light of Science newly born Hath scatter'd all the gods and God their guide, So that, for calm assurance of our souls, We mathematically demonstrate Infinite God as infinitely false To infinite impossibility. Henceforth a grievous shadow quits the earth, While Man, the fruitage and the flower of things, Walks fetterless and free.’ Thus much and more, With many hints of cell and protoplasm, And of the dusk beginnings of the brain, The mild Professor said. Professor Day, A little gentleman with soft gray eyes, Whose spectacles had faced the very Sphinx And read the cosmicriddle wrought therein. He, having lived to forty years of age, Had hate for nought but ambiguity; Knew all that Science and the schools could teach, Lived for Truth only, and, had these been days Of any necessary martyrdom, Would cheerfully have given his life for Truth. Meantime, he served her cause. How wrathfully He rose his height, while angry pulpits wail'd, And from the platforms of the great Reviews Demolish'd the theistic fallacy, Pluck'd the bright mantle from the verbal form And show'd the syllogistic skeleton! Dear gentle heart, he who could be so fierce In hating what he did not deem to be, Was full of love for all the things that are; Wherefore God loved him for his unbelief And sent a ministering angel down. . . . He often thought, ‘If I should have a child, If ever life should issue out of mine, I shall uprear it on the gracious food Of Knowledge only. Superstition haunts Our very cradles: in our nurses' hands Dangle the fetish and the crucifix That darken us for ever till we die. No child of mine, if I should have a child, Shall know the legend of the Lie Divine Or lisp the words of folly that profane The wish of wisdom. Prayer is cowardice: No child of mine shall pray. Worship is fear: My child shall never know the name of fear. But when its eyes are ready to behold, Its ears to hear, my child shall wander forth, Fearlessly leaning on its father's strength, Serene in innocence and mastery.’ And so he wedded, hoping for a chi'd, A tender toy to cut his creed upon, And wedded wisely: a virgin not too young, And not too proud, and not too beautiful, But gently reared, and of a learnèd race Who held that over-learning suits but ill The creed and need of women. To his side She came not trembling, trusting in his strength, And wise enough to dimly comprehend Her gentle lord's superiority. Two years they grew together, as two trees Blending their branches; then a child was born, Which, flickering like a taper thro' the night, Went out ere dawn; but when the mother wept, And reach'd her thin hands down the darkness, whither The little life had fallen like a spark, The pale Professor (though his eyes were dim) Sat by the bedside presently, and proved— As gently as a poor man praying to God— That what had never known potential life, In all its qualities and faculties, Had never absolutely lived at all; Nay, 'twere as wise, perchance, he thought, to mourn Some faint albuminous product of the Deep, As weep for something which had ne'er achieved The motions and the mysteries of Mind, Which things are Life itself. The mother moaned; And creeping thence to his laboratory, The wise man wiped away a foolish dew That shamed the gloss of his philosophy. But comfort came a little later on; Another crying life arose and bloom'd, And faded not upon the mother's breast, But drew its milk with feeble lips, and breath'd. It was a boy, and when they brought him down, And placed him in the pale Professor's arms, He laugh'd and reach'd his little rosy hands To embrace his father; and the wise man said, Holding the babe and blushing awkwardly, ‘How naturally mammals love their young! Thus, even thus, the archetypal Ape Dandled its rough first-born!’ Whereat the nurse Exclaim'd,—not comprehending, pious soul,— ‘Thank God for sending you so fine a boy!’ And when the wise man thro' his spectacles Look'd lightnings of philosophy and scorn, She took the babe and murmur'd, kissing it, ‘Now God Almighty grant the pretty dear A ong and merry life!’ The wise man's cheek Grew pallid, for already, ere he knew, It seem'd that Superstition's skinny hand Was clutching at his pearl of innocence. He fled into his study, and therein Added a fragment to a fierce review Upholding Haeckel, proving Tyndall tame, And rating Virchow and Agnosticism; And having thus refreshed his learnèd soul, He sat by the bedside of his pale wife, Holding her hand in silence for an hour, Feeling a nameless fear upon his heart, Blent with a sense of blessing one less wise Might have mistaken for a sense of prayer. Thenceforward, with a curious scrutiny, Such as he brought to bear on things minute Dredged from the fishpond or the river's bed, He watch'd the tiny life expand and grow Stretching sensorial tendrils softly forth, Sucking its mother's milk with rosy lips, As tiny creatures of albumen suck Their nurture from the tidal ooze and foam. Then with a span he measured the small head, And watch'd the soft pink circle where the skin Closed on the milk-white matter of the brain, Hardening slowly into skull and bone; And all the while the little azure orbs Look'd upward meaningless as flowers or stars Full of a faint flame issuing from within. Then thought he, ‘It is well; a goodly child; A brain of weight above the average And phrenologically excellent! And yet how helpless in their dim beginnings The higher mammals seem, this babe of mine Nor less nor more; a feeble crying thing, Feeling with blind progressions like a plant To the full sunshine of potential life. Prick the grey cells, it dies, and has not lived; Deny it nurture, as of sun and rain, And even as a leaf it withers up, Without a sign that it hath ever been. Yea, what we bring it, it absorbs, and turns To highest use and issue; as we train Its tendrils, so it grows; and if denled Such nurture as the nobler species need, Would surely, slowly, dwindle back to beast, As is the wont of many human types Stunted and starven in their infancy. But this one, bone of mine and flesh of mine, This will I watch with ministering care, Till it rewards my patience and becomes Perfect in knowledge and in mastery, The living apex and the crown of things.’ A little later, when the mother rose, And with the consecration of her pain Clothed softly still, sat pallid by the fire, She, after resting silent for a time And casting many a hesitating glance, Said softly, ‘Dear, have you reflected yet How we shall christen him?’ Stung by the word, The wise man murmur'd, ‘Christen?— christen him?’ Then, flush'd with wrath, ‘The very word is rank With superstition and idolatry— Do not repeat it, as you love the child.’ Whereat the mother, timorously firm, Said, smiling, ‘But the child must have a name! What shall we call him?’ Puzzled for the time, The wise man pursed his lips and shook his head, And scrutinised the little rosy face As if for inspiration and for help. Then one by one they named the names of men, From Adam down to Peter, Paul, and john, And scorning these as over-scriptural, They counted o'er the legion heathen names But found them fraught with superstition too. ‘Our infant,’ the Professor moralised, ‘Heathen no more than Christian, shall receive No gift from Heathendom or Christendom, Not even that slightest of all shades, a name. Could I invent?—but no, invented names Ever sound barbarous—I will rack my books, And find one fitting; there is time to spare; Take thought and wait!’ So many a quiet night They talk'd it o'er, and after hovering long O'er Thales (‘Evolution's Morning Star,’ The wise man styled him, while the mother's ear Was shock'd at the mere sound of ‘Thales Day’), Rejecting Bruno and Galileo, They found the thing they sought upon their shelves, And pausing at the famous ‘Institutes,’ They chose the learned name—Justinian. Not at the font with painted windows round, Not through the office of a priest in lawn Sprinkling with white hands the baptismal dew, The infant took his name; but quietly One Sunday morn, in the laboratory, With casts and fœtal forms around about, The wise man, kissing him upon the brow, Named him ‘Justinian;’ and the mother's voice Echo'd ‘Justinian;’ and the naming him Would have been wholly joyful and complete, But for a jangling sound of bells that rang Suddenly from the churches round about,— Calling the folk of Christendom to prayer! Pass o'er the seasons when with baby lips The infant drew its nurture from the breast, And when with tottering steps he first began To walk erect upon the ground and shape The first faint sounds to mimic human speech. Behold him, then, at five years old, a child Large-eyed, large-brow'd, and somewhat pale of cheek, Clutching a thin forefinger as he ran And prattled at the pale Professor's side, Companions now they grew from day to day, For while within his study 'mong his books The wise man sat, the infant at his feet Sat looking up; or, on the table perch'd, Blink'd like a pretty gnome; and every morn When for a hurried constitutional The father trotted over Hampstead Heath, The little one would toddle by his side, Happy and garrulous, and looking up With question after question.—Thus the child Heard, at an age when other children feed On nursery rhymes and tales of Fairyland, The wondrous song of Science; how at first The nebulæ cohered, how this round orb Rose out of chaos, how it lay in space Eyeless and dark until the sun's red hand Touched it upon the heart and made it live, And how the first faint protoplasmic forms, Amœbæ, infusoria, stirr'd and moved In troubled depths of some primeval ooze. All this, and more, translated tenderly Into soft words of just one syllable, Justinian heard, not understanding yet, But turning all the solemn cosmic fact To pretty fancy such as children love. What solemn truth, what sad solemnity, May not an infant turn to poesy? Instead of Gorgon and Chimæra dire, His fancy saw the monstrous mastodon; Instead of fairies of the moonlight wood, Strange shapes that lurk in strata or disport In some green waterdrcp; instead of myths, He read the faëry story of the World. From childhood upward, till the end, he knew No teacher save his father, and, indeed, Since never teacher could be tenderer, He did not miss the lore of love itself. As patient as a woman, firm yet fond, Hoarding his very heart up in the boy, The father tended, taught him, watch'd him grow. At eight years old Justinian lisp'd in Greek And readily construed Lucretius;— He read the great stone Book whereon is writ The riddle of the world from age to age; Knew the fair marvels of the Zodiac, The stars and their processions; had by heart The elemental truths of chemistry . . . And zealously, within a mental maze, As dense as that which covered Rosamond, His teacher guarded him against the creeds. For gospel, he had knowledge, and for God, His gentle human father; and indeed No child that lisps a heavenly Father's name Could lisp it with a fonder fairer faith Than fill'd him when he named his earthly one. Now when the boy was scarcely ten years old, Wise far beyond the wisdom of his years, The mother, wasting of a long disease, Died, leaving a great void within his heart Only the father's larger love could fill. The wise man sorrow'd little, having view'd His helpmate with a calm superior care, Approving her, but hoarded in his boy; And thenceforth, sire and son were all in all To one another. Oft the pair were seen Seated in scientific lecture-halls, The wise man blinking thro' his spectacles, The boy, his little image, by his side, Like small by greater owl; and evermore When, hastening home, they pass'd some shadowy Shrine The father drew his treasure closer to him, Lest some dark Phantom from within the porch Should mar the crystal mirror of his soul. The seasons sped; at sixteen years of age Justinian was famous in the haunts Where wise men gather, and in deep debate Could hold his own among grey honour'd heads And pass with pedants for a prodigy. At seventeen, he wrote that bold review, Attributed for several weeks to Mill, Denuding Buckle and his theory Of History's four stages. How men smiled, When some one blabb'd and the strange truth was told, To find the grown man's pompous periods Dissected into folly by a boy! Now for the first time on the father's heart There fell the shadow of a nameless fear Lest all this building of a noble mind Should fail and perilously come to nought. For lo! despite the glow of happy pride, Justinian's cheek was pale, his gentle eyes Deep sunken, and he stoop'd beneath the weight Of too much wisdom; oftentimes his face, Tho' firm in faith and beautiful resolve, Seem'd set in silent sorrow. At last, one night, After a crowded meeting of the learn'd, A great physician and his father's friend Took him apart and whisper'd in his ear,— ‘Take care, my dear professor, of your boy!— I do not like that cough—he works too hard— His life is very precious to us all— Be sure to watch him well.’ From that day forth The father's heart was burthen'd with a dread He never phrased to any human ear. Hungrily, with sick hunger of the soul, He watched his treasure, sleepless ev'n by night, Like some wan miser who for ever hears The robber's foot upon the creaking stair Coming to take his gold. He watch'd and watch'd, Hiding his terror with a cheerless smile, Each light or shade that softly chased itself On the sweet boyish face. Was it a dream?— Or did Death pass, and with a finger-point Leave one deep crimson spot on either cheek As signal of decay? No, no, not Death! Not Death, but Life, now made the blue eyes gleam So marvellously bright; the small hands grow Thin and blue vein'd, with pink blood glimmering thro' Like light thro' alabaster; the brave brow So marble-cold and clear!—Yet presently He led him to the great physician's house And asked for counsel. ‘Take him to the sea,’ Said the physician; ‘keep away all books; Let brain and body rest for three months’ space— Then, when we know what sun and sea can do To make him rosy, come to me again.’ They went together to the sea, and there, Fann'd by the potent breath, the young man's cheek Grew brighter, and the father's heart took cheer. But one day, as they sat upon the beach Watching the great smooth billows break themselves With solemn lapse upon the shell and sand, Justinian said, not loudly, in a voice As if communing softly with himself, ‘Father, if I should die!’ The very word Seem'd sad and terrible and fraught with fear. And starting at the sound, the wise man cried, ‘Die? and so young!—that is a foolish thought! You cannot, will not, die!’ But with his eyes Fix'd on the ever-breaking line of foam, Justinian answer'd, ‘Soon or late, Death comes— A little earlier, or a little later, What matter? In the end we falter back Into the nothingness from which we rose. Well have you taught me, father, that our life Is but the climbing and the falling wave. I do not fear to die. No foolish tale Of priest or pope affrights me; I have read The secret of the world, and know indeed That Death is Silence and an end of all.’ ‘But you will live!’ ‘For what? To read again A tale thrice told; to hear a few more years The same cold answer to my questionings; To be a little wiser possibly, And being so, a little sadder? Nay! I am weary of it all—I have lived my life!’ ‘Lived?’ cried the wise man, holding the thin hand, ‘Lived? you, a stripling still, not yet a man— You know not what you say. When you are well (And 'twill be soon) you'll laugh at these sad moods And gather up your force to face anew For many a merry year the shocks of Time. Have comfort!—I am sixty years of age, And am not weary yet!’ The young man smiled And press'd the gentle hand that held his own. ‘Dear father, since we do not measure time Merely by seasons past, 'tis I am old, And you that are the boy! How cheerfully You con the lesson you have learn'd by heart So many a busy year. Why were we born? To come into the sunlight and demand Whence come we, wh ther go we, then to pass Back into silence and to nothingness. You say that life is long—alas! that life Which ends at all, is far too brief for me. Sixty years hence, if I could live till then, I should be no less bitter to depart, To pass into a silence and a sleep, Than this day, or to-morrow. Dearest father, My faith is firm as yours. I know full well There is no God or Gods, as mad folk dream, Beyond these echoes: that with man's last breath All individual being ends for ever, And with the chemic crystals of the brain Dries up that gas the preachers christen Soul. Were I to live an hundred years and ten, To realise old wives' and prophets' tales Of man's longevity, what could I learn Not taught already? I could hear no more Than I have heard;—than you have taught me, father, Almost with my first breath.’ Then, in a voice Broken and thick with tears, the wise man cried, ‘I have taught you over-much!—My son, my son, Forgive me for my love and over-zeal! I have been too cruel, placing on your strength, Too slight to bear it, such a weight of work As pales the cheek and rusts the wholesome blood. But you shall rest! throwing all books aside, We two will seek the breezes on the sea And on the mountains! Then you will be strong, And casting off these sad distemper'd fears, Become a man indeed!’ From that day forth The silken thread of love, that ran unseen Between the hearts of father and of son, Tighten'd with many a pang of hope and dread. Now for the first the father realised Parting was possible, and with sick suspense He watch'd the shadow and the sunbeam fight For victory on the pallid patient face. When winter came they flitted to the south, And there, amid a land of pine and vine, Under a sapphire sky, Justinian seem'd To gather strength and walk about renew'd. Then ever in that fair land they heard the sound Of soft church-bells, and ever in their walks They came on rudely painted images Of Jesus and Madonna, and beheld At every step the shaven face of priests. Among these signs of blind and ignorant faith They walk'd like strangers in an alien clime, Wondering and pitying, pitied in their turn By all who saw them slowly pass along; The tall boy leaning on the father's arm, The old man with a woman's tender care Uplooking in his face, with sleepless eyes, Watching his pearl of pearls. At last they came Unto a place most peaceful and most fair, Upon the margin of a crystal lake Set in the hollow of Italian hills. There an eternal summer seem'd to dwell In an eternal calm. On every side The purple mountains rose with filmy lights And slender scarfs of white and melting mist, While down below were happy orange groves And gleaming emerald slopes, and crimson crags Upon whose sides hung chalets white as snow Just peeping from deep fringe of flower and fern. And all the crag and chalet, grove and wood, With snow-white gleams of silent cataracts For ever frozen in the act to fall, Were imaged, to the tiniest flower or leaf, In the cerulean mirror of the lake,— Save when across the stillness crystalline A gondola with purple shade crawl'd slowly And blurr'd the picture with its silvern trail. Here then they rested, in a cottage set Upon the green edge of a promontory, Where, sitting side by side, with images Reflected in the azure sleeping lake, They often heard the boatman's even-song Come from a distance like a sound in sleep; And often faintly from the crags o'er head Tinkled the chapel bell. But day by day The young man felt the life-blood in his heart Fail more and more, till oftentimes his life Would seem as sad and faint and indistinct As those soft sounds. Once, as they linger'd there, A gentle Lutheran priest whose home was near Came, hearing that the youth was sick to death, And sought to give them comfort; but the sire, With something of a learnèd anger left, Tho' gently, warn'd him from the sufferer's side. Then coming to his son, ‘How far these priests Scent sorrow!—they would make the merry world A charnel-house to do their office in! I sent the preacher packing; he seemed vex'd To hear that you were growing strong and well And did not need his prayers!’ and with a smile Of sad entreaty, ‘Yes, you are growing strong! And you will soon be well!’ Divinely blue The heavens were bending o'er the young man's head, Blue lay the peaceful lake, and in its breast Another heaven as divinely blue Throbb'd through its own soft sunlight rapturously. Propp'd in his chair Justinian gazed around. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘dear father, hold my hand— In all the world there is no comfort left Like feeling your kind touch. Now listen to me! I know I shall not leave this place alive— My time has almost come!’ ‘No, no!’ ‘Dear father! When the faint flame of life is flickering low, They say that even mindless beasts and birds Know that the end is near; and lo, I know it, For all my sense grows dim. A little while And I shall be a part of that soft sleep Upon the lake and on the purple hills And in the quiet grave where no shape stirs. But now it does not seem so hard to go, Since all life seems a dream within a dream And I myself the strangest dream of all. To those fair elements whence first I came— Water and earth and air—I shall return; And see! how tranquil and how beautiful They wait for me, the immortal ministers Of Man and all that shares mortality!’ Then in a voice that seemed the very sound Of his own rending heart the father cried: ‘My son! Justinian! child of mine old age! Sole comfort of my dark and dreary days! You cannot go! you cannot fade away! No, no, you must not die! How shall I live Bereft of you? Where shall my soul find rest, When all I cherish, all the loving mind That I have nurtured so, depart so soon? No, I will hold you—I will clasp you to me— Nothing shall part us, nay, not Death itself; For if you die, my only boy, my pride, I will die too!’ Then, as he clasped his son, And looked into the thin and tearful eyes, And felt the slight frame tremble through and through As if with chill of some cold blighting breath, He suddenly raised up his face to heaven And unaware, with a great gush of tears, Moan'd ‘God! God! God!’ Startled at that strange cry, Justinian murmur'd ‘Father!’ and the two Clung close to one another tremulously In pain too quick for speech; but when the storm Of sudden agony had passed away, There came a pause—a long and tearful pause— And each could feel the other's beating heart And the quick coming of the other's breath. Then presently their eyes met, and a light Of some new wonder fill'd Justinian's eyes, While softly, quietly, he said, ‘My father! Since I was but a babe upon the breast, And ever upward through the happy years, Your eyes have been the source of all my seeing, Your mind the living font of all my thoughts, Tell me, dear father—now, before we part— And tell me firmly, with no thought of fear, Is it for ever? Have I read, indeed, My lesson truly? Tell me am I right? For you have taught me truth is best of all— Is this the utter end of all our love, And shall we never meet and know each other Again, as we have known each other here?’ Then sobbing like a child the old man cried: ‘Ask me not!—Pity me, and ask no more; For lo, I seem as one whose house has fallen About his feet in ruins, and who stands Living, aghast, with ashes on his head, Clouded with horror, half awaked from sleep. I know there is no God—Nature herself, More mighty and more terrible than God, Hath taught me that—but till this piteous hour I never craved for God or named his Name. I asked not for him, craved no alms of Heaven, Nor hunger'd for another better life Than this we live; all that I sought on earth Was you, my child, my son. Stay with me here, Let us remain a little more together— And I shall be content.’ Then with a smile Angelically sad, Justinian said: ‘It is enough—torture your heart no more. Hold to our faith—be strong—for though I die Fairer than I shall live. Now, read to me That sweet preamble of Lucretius I always loved so much—because it brought The very breath of fields and happy flocks, With that great animal content and joy Which fills the earth to which we all return.’ Then trembling, in a voice made thick with tears, The old man at the bidding of the boy Read the rich periods of the only bard Who faced with fearless front unconquerable That Shape so many see,—a Skeleton Standing amid the universal snow Of seeds atomic, pointing dimly down. ‘For of the mighty scheme of Heaven and Gods I now shall sing, unfolding to thy gaze The everlasting principles of things— Whence Nature forms, increases, and sustains All forms that are, and whither as they die She evermore dissolves each form again. These principles we in our human speech Call matter or the generative seeds, Bodies primordial whence all things that be Were marvellously fashioned from the first.’ The following is the original text of the passages of Lucretius, translated in the text and printed in italics:— ‘Nam tibi de summa cœli ratione deûmque Disserere incipiam, et rerum primordia pandam; Unde omnes natura creet res, auctet alatque; Quove eadem rursum natura perempta resolvat; Quæ nos materiem, et genitalia corpora rebus Reddenda in ratione vocare, et semina rerum Appellare suëmus, et hæc eadem usurpare Corpora prima, quod ex illis sunt omnia primis.’ De Rer. Nat., Book i. 54-62. With eyes half closed, his face suffused with sunlight, The pale boy listen'd, while the verse flow'd on. ‘This darkness, this deep shadow of the mind Neither the sunrise nor the darts of day Have power to scatter; but it shall dissolve Before the light of reason and the face Of Nature's self. First, for exordium, Lay thou to heart this first great principle— Nought e'er is form'd from nought by Power Divine! . . . But when we have studied deep and comprehend That Power Divine can ne'er make nought from nought, Then shall we know that which we seek to know— How everything is fashion'd first and last, And all things wrought without the help of God!’ The following is the original text of the passages of Lucretius, translated in the text and printed in italics:— ‘Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necesse est Non radii solis, neque lucida tela diei Discutiant, sed naturæ species ratioque: Principium hinc cujus nobis exordia sumet, Nullam rem e nihilo gigni divinitus unquam . . . Quas ob res, ubi viderimur nil posse creari De nihilo, tum, quod sequimur, jam rectius inde Perspiciemus. et unde queat res quæque creari, Et quo quæque modo fiant opera sine divûm.’ De Rer. Nat., Book i. 147-151, 156-159. So far he read, and paused; and as he paused A change came o'er the face he gazed upon As if a finger touch'd the brow and eyes. The father shriek'd and shuddered, shrinking back In nameless awe, for in a moment's space, Though all the air was sunny overhead, And all the lake was golden at their feet, The twain were cover'd with a shadow cast By some dark shape unseen. ‘Hold my hand, father, For I am dying!’ Then the white face flashed To one wild look of passionate farewell, And silently, without another word, The last sad breath was drawn. They bore him in— How and by whom the gentle deed was done The father knew not, being dazed and stunn'd, But follow'd moaning, while upon his bed They placed him down; and when that afternoon A pallid Sister from the convent came To do the last sad offices of death, The old man only watch'd her in a trance And made no sign; but when, her kind task done, She touch'd him, saying in her own soft speech, ‘Signor, I trust he died in the full faith Of Christ our Lord!’ he gave a laugh so strange, So terrible and yet so pitiful, She thought his wits were gone. Fair as a star, Justinian lay upon his bed of death, And seeing him so young and beautiful The Sister gathered lilies in the garden And strew'd them on his breast; then reverently She bless'd him; and the old man look'd at her, Trembling as in a trance; but suddenly Uprising, in a hollow voice he cried, Pointing her to the door with quivering hands, ‘Begone! profane him not! from life to death I kept him safe from Superstition's touch! My boy! you shall not take him from me now!’ THE NEW BUDDHA. (SCHOPENHAUER.) In Frankfort, at the crowded table-d'hôte, Amid the steam of dishes and the sound Of chattering voices, I beheld at last The face I sought: a toothless lion's face, Grey, livid, sprinkled o'er with dust of dream, With two dim eyes that (as the lion's orbs Gaze through and past the groups around the cage Upon the sands of Afric far away) Met mine and saw me not, but mark'd beyond That melancholy desert of the Mind Where in his lonely splendour he had reign'd. But when he rose without a word, and stepped Across the threshold out into the street, I follow'd reverently, and touch'd his arm. Frowning he turn'd. ‘Your pardon,’ I exclaimed, Standing bareheaded in the summer sun— ‘To the new Buddha, Arthur Schopenhauer, I've come with letters from your sometime friend, Hestmann of Hamburg. Bliss it were, indeed, If for a space you suffered me to gaze On the one fountain of philosophy Still sparkling to refresh an arid world!’ He took the letters, glanced them grimly through, Then his face brighten'd and he smiled well pleased; Then nodding, said: ‘You come in season, sir! I lack an arm to lean on as I walk, And now, if you are willing, yours will serve. For, as you see, your Buddha (so men please To style me; and if zeal to make men wise, To free them from their yoke of misery, Constitute godship, I deserve the name!) Your Buddha groweth old, is well-nigh spent, And soon must pass away.’ ‘Nay,’ I replied, ‘For many a summer and a winter more Your living force must flow to gladden man: Philosophy is still too halt and blind To spare you yet!’ More brightly still his face Flash'd answer to the flattery of my words. ‘Right, right!’ he murmur'd. ‘After all, they are wise Who flout the Bible's three-score years and ten; A strong man's season is a hundred years, Nor less nor more; and I, though grey and bent, May see another generation yet!’ I had reach'd his heart at once, as courtiers gain The hearts of kings. So, resting on mine arm, Smiling and nodding gently, as we went, He passed with me along the sunny street; And on our way I spake with youthful warmth Of that new gospel which the lonely man Had offered all in vain for two-score years To every passer-by in this dull world; And what himself had said a thousand times I said with zeal—that in the sun there stood Temples and towers, but only Memnon's sang, And his was Memnon's to a listening world. Still more complacent grew his deity, Finding so passionate a worshipper! And presently he questioned of myself, My birthplace, and my business in the city. English by name and accent, as he guessed? Was his name known in England? he inquired, With quick solicitous glance; and when I said His name was known and reverenced through the land, His pale cheek flush'd with pleasure once again. Then, as we passed along the populous streets, With houses, shops, and marts on either side, And folk as thick as bees that throng i' the hive, He, finding I was apt, grew garrulous: Told of his weary years of martyrdom, Through which, neglected and despised, he framed His creed of grand negation and despair; How, bitter at the baseness of the world, Yet never faltering as his hand set down In philosophic rhythm the weary sound Made by the ocean of the Will which beats For ever on these wrinkled sands of Time, He had waited, till the pigmies wrought his crown; How every man-made god, or god-made man, Had lied, until he spake the ‘Sesame’ Which opened the great cavern of the truth To every soul that yearn'd to creep therein; And how, now all was said that thought could say, He rested, while the nations one by one Approved—Nirwâna! As he spake, he paused Before a great cathedral whose tall spire Pointed a fiery finger up at Heaven. Then, smiling, ‘Still the pagan temples stand, And from the heart of each a bleeding god, Not Buddha or a greater, spins his web To entangle insects of Humanity. Henceforth the battle is between us twain,— I who have scaled the Heavens and found them bare, I who have cast the Heavenly Father down, And Christ that cries, “He reigns!”’ He rose erect, Nostrils dilated, eyes grown fiercely bright, With possible conquest. ‘'Tis the Christ or I, And face to face we stand before the age! All other of the intellectual gods, Save I alone, were frail or timorous, Mad or god-drunken; I alone have set My finger on the canker of the world, Saying 'Tis fatal—'Tis incurable— And I defy the Christ to find a cure! The Titans, headed by Prometheus (Whom we in Deutschland call Immanuel Kant), Marshal'd their hosts against the Olympian throne, And one by one before its shadowy seat Fell, mumbling “God;” the tempests of the mind Enwrapt and overpowered them, and they fell; Last of the race, their Epimetheus, Our moonstruck Hegel, gibbering like an ape, Follow'd the phantom God whom he denied Garrulously up and down! My turn was next. I stood alone upon the eternal shore, And heard the thunder of the waves of Will Upmounting to destroy me, till I spake The mystic word “Nirwâna,” and behold! They heard me and obeyed me, and were hush'd. A Spirit stood beside me, even Death, And in his clammy palm I placed my hand, And still together, masters of the hour, We stand triumphant, waiting the event!’ Again he took my arm and on we walk'd Towards Sachsenhausen. Passing o'er the bridge, 'Mid crowds of pleasure-seeking citizens, We came among the parks and flowery ways And heard among the sunbeam-laden trees The fluttering and the singing of the birds. From neighbouring gardens came the fiddle's sound, The flute's soft whistle, and the eager shouts Of merry-making folk. Then, sitting down, Upon a bench o'erhung with whispering leaves, We watched the stream of festal men and maids That overflowed the roads and garden walks. Loud in the summer sunshine sang the birds, Answered by human voices, while the sage Looked sadly on, and mused: ‘The stress of pain Dwells on the heartstrings of the feather'd choir, Who, prompted by the goad of fiery love (Veneris ictus, as Lucretius sings), Toil restlessly, build nests, uprear their young, With eager palpitations, ever fearing The shadow of the cruel kestrel, Death, Hovering above them. Sounds their summer cry So merry, say you? 'Tis the o'erburdened heart Spilling itself in waves of agony, Which only to the sense of babes can seem Sweet and ecstatic! Walk abroad; and mark The cony struggling in the foumart's fangs, The deer and hare that fly the sharp-tooth'd hound, The raven that with flap of murderous wing Hangs on the woolly forehead of the sheep And blinds its harmless eyes; nor these alone, But every flying, every creeping thing, Anguishes in the fierce blind fight for life! Sharp hunger gnaws the lion's entrails, tears The carrion-seeking vulture, films with cold The orbs of snake and dove. For these, for all, Remains but one dark Friend and Comforter, The husher of the weary waves of Will, Whom men name Peace or Death.’ ‘A piteous creed!’ I answer'd. ‘Surely yonder thrush's song Is not all sadness? Hark how joyfully He, clinging to the laden apple-bough, Trills out his “lover-lover! kiss-kiss sweet!” And yonder youth and maiden listening Sit hand in hand as if in Paradise, And seeing heaven in each other's eyes, Forget for once that love can die or change Or youth's gay music turn to jangling bells Or funeral discord!’ On my Buddha's face A dark smile gather'd like a sulphurous flash Upon a lonely cloud, and died away. ‘Behold,’ he said, ‘the woman close at hand Suckling her sickly babe: poor soul, she smiles To feel the famished lips that draw her milk And drink her feeble life! Call you that smile The light of living joy? To me it seems Rapture of misery ineffable, Such as the birds and beasts bear in their breasts Starving to feed their young! Then mark again That other, like a ripe and rich-hued fruit Pit-speck'd and rotten to the very core! She flaunts her painted beauty in the sun And hangs upon the arm of yonder Jew Whose little eyes are shrivell'd in his head With Nature's light of lust. Priapus still Is god o' the garden! Not a stone's-throw hence, Temples obscene as those Vesuvius once Smother'd with fiery lava, still attest The infamous worship! Wheresoe'er we gaze, On quiet field or busy haunts of men, Among the creeping or the upright beasts, Comes Nature, grinning like a procuress, Bringing her innocent victims to assuage The fire herself hath sown in the quick veins Of all that live. Call you that quenchless fire Peaceful or joyful?—yet by that alone We move and have our being!’ ‘Nay,’ I cried. ‘For surely there is Love which conquers it, And Passion pallid as the passion-flower Rooted in earth but showering up to heaven Its wealth of stainless blooms!’ ‘Love conquers it,’ He answer'd with a weary inward smile, ‘If e'er it conquers, by the privilege Of some supremer pain. The ascending scale, From lower up to higher, only marks The clearing of the flame until its light Grows wholly sacrificial. Beasts and birds Struggle and agonise to increase their kind, Obeying blind pulsations which began Deep in the burning breast of yonder Sun Whose corporal beams we are! Creation ever Obeys the blind vibration which arose Ere yet the timorous nebulæ cohered To fashion fiery worlds; but we who stand Supreme, the apex and the crown of things, Have gained supremacy of suffering And sovereignty of limitless despair!’ How merrily the festal music rose, While men and women 'neath the lindentrees Join'd in the dance, and happy children cried, And birds with quick precipitous rapture shower'd Their answer from the blossom-laden boughs! Sunny as Eden seemed the earth that day; And yet, methought, I saw the sunlight shrink And all creation darken suddenly, As if from out the umbrage there had peer'd The agate-eyes o' the Snake! Then, as I gazed Into the pallid dreamer's filmy orbs, Methought the flesh and hair were shrivell'd up, And in their places skin and scale appeared, Till on his belly crawling serpent-wise My Buddha slipt into the undergrass And disappear'd. The fancy vanishing, I heard his voice intoning at my side. ‘Supremacy of sorrow gained at last, Agony upon agony multiplied And crystallised in knowledge, He, your Christ, Rose and confronted Nature, as a dove Might face eternal Deluge. “Comfort yet,” He murmur'd, “while I set, upon the brows Of all who suffer, this red crown of thorns, And speak the promise of eternal life.” Eternal Life! Eternal strife and sorrow! Man's privilege of misery ascending Scale after scale, until at last it gains An immortality of suffering! What marvel if the tortured victim shrinks From infinite possibilities of pain, And casting down that crown, calling a curse On Nature, dwindling down the scale which once He eagerly ascended, gains the beast, Holds hideous orgy, or like Niobe Weeps—and is fix'd in stone! Helpless and frail, Sharing the desolation he surveys, Christ crawleth back into His sepulchre And sleeps again. . . . Meantime, out of the womb Of sorrow springs another Comforter, Your Buddha, even I, the lonely man Who walks the waves of Will as long ago The Galilean seem'd to walk the sea. “Patience!” I whisper; “take the gift I bring— No crown of thorns, no promise of more life, But this black poppy, pluck'd upon a grave! The Ocean, though its waters wash as far As the remotest sphere, as the last sun Just crackling, shrivelling, like a leaf i' the fire, The Ocean wide as Life, hath still—a shore! On those dark sands each troublous wave is still'd, Breaks, falls, and stirs no more, though other waves, Pain following pain, identity that crowds Fast on identity, shall still succeed. Ye are weary—sleep; ye are weeping— weep no more; As ye have come, depart; as ye have risen To the supremest crest of suffering, Break, overflow, subside, and cease for ever.” Man hears. He feels, though all the rest be false, One thing is certain—sleep: more precious far Than any weary walkings in the sun. Shall not the leafy world even as a flower Be wither'd in its season; or, grown cold, Even like a snowflake melting in the light, Fade very silently, and pass away As it had never been? Shall Man, predoom'd, Cling to his sinking straw of consciousness, Fight with the choking waters in his throat, And gasp aloud, “More life, O God, more life! More pain, O God”? . . . Nay, let him silently, Bowing his head like some spent swimmer, sink Without a sigh into the blest Abyss Dark with the shipwreck of the nations, strewn With bones of generations—lime of shells That once were quick and lived. Even at this hour He pauses, doubting, with the old fond cry, Dreaming that some miraculous Hand may snatch His spirit from the waters! Let him raise His vision upward, and with one last look, Ere all is o'er, behold “Nirwâna” writ Across the cruel Heavens above his head In fiery letters, fading characters Of dying planets, faintly flickering suns, Foredoom'd like him to waste away and fade, Extinguish'd in the long eternal Night.’ As one who walks in gardens of the feast, When the last guests flit down the lamphung walks To music sadly ceasing on the air, And sees a dark arm pass from lamp to lamp, Quenching them one by one, so did I seem Hearkening that voice of cheerless prophecy. I rose, walked on, he leaning on mine arm, I listening; and where'er we went methought Sorrow and sunlessness preceded us; So that the people dancing 'neath the trees, The birds that fluted on the blossoming boughs, The music and the murmur, made more sharp My sense of desolation. Everywhere I saw the hovering ernes, Despair and Death, Watching their victim, Man. A space we walked In silence, then I murmur'd: ‘Can it be That Death and Death's Despair are paramount? That, even as suns and systems are consumed, The mind of man, which apprehends or dreams It apprehends them, shares their destiny? Is there not something deathless, which denies The victory to Death?’ ‘Their Christ says “Yea,”’ Answer'd the Buddha; ‘and with that lure and lie Hath led the world for eighteen hundred years. The mind of Man is as the rest—a flash Of sunfire, nothing more; a quality Pertaining only to the perishable. Thought is a struggle with the Unconscious; soon The struggle ceases, and the Unconscious drinks The thinker and the thought for evermore. Blessèd is he who, having wildly watch'd The beauteous mirage of a heavenly Home, Knoweth 'tis mirage only, and sinks down To slumber on the arid stretch of sand Whereon his weary feet have trod so long: The sun shall shine upon him, and the stars Fulfil their ministrations; he shall hear No more the wailings of the flocks and herds Slain to assuage the appetite for life; No thing that suffers and no thing that slays Shall mar his peace with pain or sympathy; Dust, he returns to dust; life, he resolves To life unconscious, such as quickeneth In even trees and stones; his dream is o'er For ever; and he hath become a part Of elemental dumb Eternity.’ ‘If this be so, dear Master,’ I returned, ‘What then remains for us who walk i' the sun? For surely Love is curst, if Love must die Like breath upon a mirror, like the dew Clothing the Hûleh lily; and alas! Since Love goes, what abides of heavenly hope To abate our weary heart-beats?’ With a smile He answered: ‘Fold thine arms upon thy breast And face thy destiny Prometheus-like, Not flattering even to its face the Power That makes and shall unmake thee! Give the ear To Jesus and his gaunt attendant gods, Jove or Jehovah, and remain—a slave; Shut up thine ears, and give those gods the lie, And stand erect in fearless sovereignty Of limitless despair! Grand even in Death, Yea, grand because of Death, the mind of Man Can front the issue of the Inevitable, Despising and appraising and defying The anarchy and tyranny that spare No shape that lives. Nature is pitiless; Then be thou pitiful. Cruel is the world; Then be thou kind, even to the creeping thing That crawls and agonises in its place As thou in thine. Fever and Pestilence Make and keep open one long-festering wound; Anoint it with the balm of charity, The oil of leechcraft. Thus, and thus alone, Shalt thou in sheer defeat find victory, And 'midst the very blast of that strong Voice Which crieth “Love is not,” shall thy last word Attest Love's triumph, and thy soul remain Immortal even in Death!’ In proud revolt He paused, and pointed at the pallid heavens As if arraigning Nature, while his hand Trembled with palsy, and his eye was film'd, And in his feeble frame the undaunted heart Plunged, like a prison'd bird worn out and dying. Then cunningly, to change the cheerless chord He struck so strenuously, I spake again Of his great labour, ever-increasing fame, The homage of the world, and the long reach Of honour, opening for his feet to tread; And soon the Lion saw, not desert sands, But gentle worshippers that led him on With chains of flowers, tamely to crouch beside The footstools of anointed crownèd kings. Bright'ning he spake of labours yet to do, Fair fields of fame unreapt, glad days and merry, Of taking gifts and yielding oracles! So cheerfully, like one that loved his life, He prattled on, beneath the blossoming boughs, In answer to the carol of the birds, The shouting of the children, the glad sound Of festal fife and flute. At evenfall We parted, he to seek his lonely house, I to the city hostel where I lodged; But as he faded from me in the street Touch'd by the bright beams of the rising moon, Surely I saw the Shadow men name Death Creeping behind him. Turning with a sigh, I left him in the graveyard of his creed. NIETZSCHE. Jupiter's gutter-snipe! A shrill-tongued thing Running beside the blood-stain'd chariot wheels, Crying ‘Hosannah to the pitiless King, The ravening Strength that neither spares nor feels!’ A slave that glorified the yoke and goad, Cast mud into the well of human tears, Gibed at the Weak who perish on the road, Slain by the Law which neither heeds nor hears! ‘All hail to the Eternal Might and Right, By which all life is sifted, slain, and shed! Lord, make me hard like thee that day and night I may approve thy ways, however dread!’ So cried he, while, indifferent to his cries, Nature's triumphal Car went grinding past,— And lo, the dust was blown into his eyes, And crush'd 'mid blood and mud, he sank at last. Poor gutter-snipe! Answer'd with his own prayer, Back to primeval darkness he has gone;— Only one living soul can help him there, The gentle human god he spat upon! THE LAST FAITH. Lose the last faith of all, and die indeed— Keep that, and thou may'st live! When all the rest Has faded like thy breath upon a mirror, When all the thrones of all the gods have fallen, When God Himself remains not even a Name, Gaze in the faces of thy fellow-men For one last comfort. If those faces seem Vacant and foul, if all Humanity Assumes the blackness of thine own despair, So that thou echoest the preacher's cry That Man is base as any Drunkard's dream, Turn round into the darkness, veil thy face, For thou art lost to all Eternity! Now, when the Heavens are empty and no sign Comes from the Eternal Silence, loudly still The blind priest raves, and all the slaves of God Shriek their approval! ‘Man,’ they cry, ‘is evil, Yea, canker'd thro' and thro' with Sin's disease, And cruelty, the aftermath of Sin; In the beginning God stretched out a Hand To heal him, but he thrust the Hand away And hid his evil face in dust of lust, And so is lost for ever, save for grace Of Him he hath offended!’ Lie of lies! Yet how the hordes of madmen echo it, Not knowing that they curse themselves and God, Cursing the only thing that Death and Time Spare and preserve Divine. In this dark world What moves my wonder most is, not that Man Is so accurst and warp'd from heavenly love, But that, despite the pitfalls round his feet, He falls into so few,—despite the hate And anarchy of Nature, echoed on In his own heart-beats, he can love so much! He stumbles, being blind; he eateth dust, Being fashion'd out of dust; flesh, he pursues The instincts of the flesh; but evermore He, struggling upward from the slough of shame, Confronts the Power which made him miserable And stands erect in love, a living Soul! Doubt that, doubt all. I tell you I have walk'd For many a weary year these wastes of woe, And found beneath the shining of the sun No creature wholly evil; nay, I have seen Ev'n in the very dregs and filth of Sin A power, a patience, and a gentleness That put ev'n gods to shame. 'Twas long my custom To haunt the byways of great Towns by night, Seeking for Souls,—and chiefly for the Souls Of outcast women. (Man may save himself; The world is not so leagued against mere Man, But Woman is bound down a million-fold By blinded generations, led alas! By the Semitic Christ.) I have stood for hours Watching the gin-shop's bloodshot eyeballs flash, Or with an aching hunger following The shadows on the window of the brothel In hope to catch some glimmering of a waif Whose message was to me. God gave to me This gift,—to know at once, to recognise Instantly, in a face-flash, as it were, The creature I can help. All night my foot Has troubled the dead silence of the slums, Oft broken by the drunken mother's shriek, The dull sound of a blow, a body's fall; And when the cry of ‘Murther’ hath arisen, My eyes have been the first to see, my hand The first to raise, the bleeding mother's form, The children's slaughter'd clay. My place has been Under lone scaffolds in the dim grey dawn, Watching Man's murderers lead forth to death The poor sick wretch with haggard eyes and knees That knock together; and my wrath hath risen In protestation deeper, if less loud, Than the thief's laughter and the rowdy's oath Beside me. I have wander'd like a ghost Down shrouded walls of hideous Hospitals, Following my quest from bloody bed to bed, Each desecrated to man's cruelty And feminine corruption. I have seen Such sorrow, such destruction, such despair, That in the atmosphere these things exhaled Reason hath totter'd, lost its throne, and swoon'd; I know all sins woman or man can sin, I know all viper-nests where such sins breed, I mark the Tree of Evil root and branch, And from the darkest bough that grows thereon My hands have pluckt some precious human fruit; My hands have gather'd flowers of heavenly light And loveliness, that God, if God there be, Will never leave to die. Then, quit the depths, And climb the heights, of Life—what gracious flowers Are growing gladly there! what deeds of grace Attest the power and privilege of Love To elude Heaven's cruelty and Life's caprice And grow divine indeed! Here rests my faith, The last fond faith of all: not far away In the void Heavens up yonder, not on creeds Upbuilded 'mid the ever-shifting sands, Not in the Temples of God's sycophants, But here, among our fellows, down as deep As the last rung of Hell!—So once again I say my wonder is, not at Man's sin, But at his patience and beneficence! How bravely, cheerfully, he bears the load Nature hath left upon him! With what courage He strangles one by one the snakes surrounding His cradle and his grave! how brightly, gladly, He takes the little blessings as they come And seeks with happy eyes the little Ligh! Hate Man, and o, thou hatest, losest God; Keep faith in Man, and rest with God indeed. And what if, after all, the God thou seekest Were here, not yonder,—God in act to be, To find and know Himself for evermore? AD CARISSIMAM AMICAM. Now that our mirth is o'er, now that our Dream is done, Now that a Hand creeps out across the heavenly blue Putting the lights of Heaven out sadly one by one, What dream beneath the moon, what hope beneath the sun Shall our poor souls pursue? Startled amid the feast we look around and lo! The Word of Doom that flames along Life's palace walls— The music dies away—the last musicians go— (Bards with their golden harps, gods in their robes of snow) And the dread Silence falls! What is the word we read in wonder and despair? ANARCHY! writ in flame for all our eyes to mark . . . Rise,—put the wine cup by,—fly out into the air! Ah, but the sunless void, the empty space, are there, And all the Heavens are dark! Nay, courage! droop thy gaze from yonder fading spheres, With thy soft azure orbs gaze in these eyes of mine— There, deep within the soul, a dim sweet light appears, The glimmer of a Dawn that sparkles out thro' tears, Brightens, and seems divine! Within us, not without, there gleams that lucent ray, Flash'd from the Founts of Dawn, a glimmer of dewy light; What tho' the gods are dead? what tho' the world grows grey? Still clearer grows the dawn of some diviner Day Transcending Death and Night. ANARCHY? . . . 'tis the word that startles and appals. LOVE! . . . 'tis the heavenly word that softly calls us hence! Without, the red word runs in fire on crumbling walls, Yea, for the World is doom'd,—dark as a spent torch falls This leaning tower o' the sense! Chaos and Night remain,—Death and the darkness blend— Yet comfort! suns shall rise tho' many a sun hath set: This is the dawn of Hope, now all save Hope doth end— Rest thy dear hand in mine, kneel with me and attend— All is not over yet; Deep in thy faithful eyes how bright the promise gleams, Answering the first faint beams of that new Dawn above— ‘Let there be LIGHT!’ God said,—Light came in orient beams; Again across the Void, faint as a voice in dreams, God saith, ‘Let there be LOVE!’ Land and Sea Songs. SPRING SONG AFTER SNOW. The swift is wheeling and gleaming, The brook is brown in its bed, Rain from the cloud is streaming, And the Bow bends overhead: The charm of the Winter is broken! the last of the spell is said! Out of the East one morning Grey Winter came in sight, But his elves with never a warning Had been at work all night, Tinkling at trees and windows, and hanging the world in white. Up, with a foggy breathing, His nose all red with cold, Round him the vapours wreathing, O'er him the dark clouds rolled, The greybeard came that morning, rheurny and blear'd and old! The sharp wind blew behind him, The swift wind ran before, The thick snow tried to blind him, His feet were chilly and sore: You could hear his wheezing and coughing, a hundred miles and more! Slowly, with feet that linger'd Up the hills and down, Chilly footed and finger'd, He came to our good Town: The fog was a robe around him, the frost had made him a crown. Woeful he seem'd and weary, As he the steeple spied, All look'd dull and dreary Under it far and wide; But when to the pond he wander'd the boys were making a slide! Comforters warm and woollen, Boots all thick and strong, With not a feature sullen There they cried in a throng: And the robin sat on the paling, watching and singing a song! Then seeing a sight so jolly, Old Winter nodded his head, And drew out a bunch of holly With berries all ripe and red, And he waved the holly for magic, while down the slide they sped! And suddenly with no warning, All at the pleasant sign, The bells rang out in the morning, And the sun began to shine,— And the host at the inn door chuckled, and all the world looked fine! . . . But now the earth is green again, And the blue swift wheels in the air; Leaves on the hedges are seen again, And the rain is rich and rare, And all for another promise the Bow bends bright up there! The Bow bends out of the heaven, Out of the cloud o'erhead, The hues in the Bow are seven, From yellow to purple and red,— Its foot on the churchyard resteth, bright on the graves of the Dead! The eel in the pond is quick'ning, The grayling leaps in the stream,— What if the clouds are thick'ning, See how the meadows gleam! The spell of the Winter is shaken, the world awakes from a dream. The fir puts out green fingers, The pear-tree softly blows, The rose in her dark bower lingers, But her curtains will soon unclose,— The lilac will shake her ringlets, over the blush of the rose! The swift is wheeling and gleaming, The woods are beginning to ring, Rain from the clouds is streaming; There, where the Bow doth cling, Summer is smiling afar off, over the shoulder of Spring! ON THE SHORE. The swift winds run Under the sun And under the silver moon,— They have taken away my little one— May they bring him back to me soon! Ye winds, I trow I care not now Though the sun hath tann'd him black, He is still my little one tho' his brow Be fierce as the wild sea-wrack; Tho' his eyes be cold As the sea-caves old, Tho' his beard be dank wi' foam, Tho' he be wavwarder twenty-fold, Blow my little one home! O loud laugh'd he, As he went from me To follow the Storms out there,— My boy that I rock'd upon my knee And nurst with a widow's prayer. He would not stay, And he sail'd away To toss on the angry Sea, And when he return'd after many a day A tall grim man was he! But evermore When he came on shore, Despite his wayward will, The world grew bright and the angry roar Of the sleepless Seas was still! Again in my breast Right glad and blest The mother's milk was stirred,— My heart grew glad as the seas at rest At a loving look or word. Run, winds, run Under the sun And under the silver moon.— Follow the ship of my little one, And hasten it homeward soon! There is nought for me On the land or sea, Or even in Heaven up there, But the boy I rock'd upon my knee And nurst with a widow's prayer! Ye Winds, that be As wayward as he, As restless and fierce and bold, Find him, and blow him again to me, Now I am weary and old! Be he far or near, Let him shoreward steer,— After him, swift winds, fly! Come back together, that I may hear Your voices mingle, and die! THE MERMAID. (WINDLASS SONG.) I. I'll tell you, mates, how she came to sea! (Heave at the windlass! heave ho! cheerily) She loved me, and I love she, For she was the gel for a Sailor! She hailed from Wapping, her name was Sue, And she was the daughter of a tailor,— We parted at last, but without ado She bought both jacket and breeches blue, And aboard she came for to join our crew And live the life of a Sailor! CHORUS. Heave at the windlass! yeo heave ho! Up with the anchor! away we go! The wind's off the shore, boys,—let it blow,— Hurrah for the life of a Sailor! Yeo—ho! II. Our Captain he eyed her from stem to starn (Heave at the windlass! heave ho! cheerily) But nought of her secret could he discarn, For his savage jib couldn't quail her. But when she went for'ard among the res Her heart began for to fail her, So she took me aside and the truth confess'd, With her face a-blushing on this 'ere breast, And I stared and stared, and says I, ‘I'm blest! My Sue turn'd into a Sailor!’ CHORUS. Heave at the windlass! yeo heave ho! Up with the anchor! away we go! The wind's off the shore, boys,—let it blow,— Hurrah for the life of a Sailor! Yeo—ho! III. Now we hadn't got far away from land (Heave at the windlass, heave ho! cheerily) When a Mermaid rose with a glass in her hand, And our ship hove to for to hail her. Says she, ‘Each wessel that looks on me, Man-o'-war, merchantman, or whaler, Must sink right down to the bottom of the sea, Where the dog-fish flies and the sea-snakes flee, Unless a Wirgin on board there be To plead for the life of a Sailor!’ CHORUS. Heave at the windlass! yeo heave ho! Up with the anchor! away we go! The wind's off the shore, boys,—let it blow,— Hurrah for the life of a Sailor! Yeo—ho! IV. Then up jumped Sue with the breeches on! (Heave at the windlass, heave ho! cheerily) ‘You nasty hussy!’ says she, ‘begone!’ And the Mermaid's cheeks grew paler! ‘There's a gel aboard and her name is Sue! A Wirgin, the daughter of a tailor, Who's more than a match for the likes of you!’ At this the Mermaid looked werry blue, And then, with a splash of her tail, with-drew, While Sue she embraced her Sailor! CHORUS. Heave at the windlass! yeo heave ho! Up with the anchor! away we go! The wind's off the shore, boys,—let it blow,— Hurrah for the life of a Sailor! Yeo—ho! THE TRAMP'S DITTY. I. Out there in the greenwood beneath a green willow, Or under a haystack, my lodging shall be, O! The sky for a curtain, the earth for a pillow, The life of a Tramp is the life that suits me, O! Sing derry down derry, It's glad and it's merry! . . . Thro' the haze of the heat Cattle low, lambkins bleat, While (tweet a tweet tweet!) The birds whistle sweet, And I lie on my back, right contented and free, O! Sing derry down derry, The life is so merry! The life of a Tramp, Be it dry, be it damp, Is a life for a King, and the right life for me, O! II. Would I eat? there's a spread in the turnipfield ready! Would I drink? there's the cow standing under a tree, O! Would I change with a lord? I'm not quite such a neddy! No, wealth and fine raiment are fiddlede-dee, O! Sing derry down derry, This life is most merry! When it rains, let it rain! In the wood or the lane, Snugly sheltered I lie Till the shower passes by,— With patter of pearls on the daisy-deckt lea, O! Then, derry down derry, The sun shines out merry,— And the heart of the Tramp, Be he rogue, be he scamp, Leaps and laughs in the light, like a wave of the Sea, O! III. And sometimes a-milking comes sun-freckled Molly, And after palaver sits down on my knee, O! And I envy no lordling his finely drest dolly, When kisses like those can be mine, with no fee, O! Thro' the haze of the heat Cattle low, lambkins bleat, And the birds sing so sweet While we kiss (tweet a tweet!), And the King and the Queen of the Meadows are we, O! Sing derry down derry, The life is so merry,— The life of a Tramp Beats the Court and the Camp, Be it day, be it night, 'tis the life that suits me, O! THE CRY FROM THE MINE. Out of the sinister caverns of Night, Out of the depths where the Hell-fires are glowing, Cometh a cry, floating up to the Light, Here, where glad mortals are reaping and sowing: ‘Night ever over us, blackness to cover us, Deeper we crawl than the graves of the Dead! Sisters and brothers, whose fires burn so cheerily, Fed by the coal that we work for so wearily, Give us, in God's name, our wages of Bread! ‘Hell burning under us, gnome-like we dwell, Store for your hearths ever scraping and scooping, Stifling and thunderous vapours of Hell Blacken our mouths, where we're stooping and drooping; Terrors environ us, lest the fierce fire on us Leap, as it leapt on our kin who are sped! Children and wives wait our wages and cry for them; Eager to toil for them, ready to die for them, Darkly we grope for our handful of Bread! ‘Sooner or later Death cometh this way,— Slain by his breathing our kindred are lying here! Old ere our time, worn and weary and grey, Bear we the burthen that's dreary as dying, here! Pain is our portion here, gruesome our fortune here, Still we're content when our dear ones are fed— Sisters and brothers, while blindly and wearily Ever we toil that your fires may burn cheerily, Give us, in God's name, our guerdon of Bread!’ Out of the sinister caverns of Night, Out of the depths where these weary ones wander, Cometh the cry, floating up to the Light. Up to the sunshine that never shines yonder: ‘Night ever over us, blackness to cover us, Toil we for ever, less living than dead!— Sisters and brothers, whose fires burn so cheerily, Fed by the coal that we dig for so drearily. See that we lack not our wages of Bread!’ THE LEAD-MELTING. 'Twas clear, cold, starry, silver night, And the Old Year was a-dying; Three pretty girls with melted lead Sat gaily fortune-trying. They dropt the lead in water clear, With blushing palpitations And, as it hissed, with fearful heart; They sought its revelations. In the deep night, while all around The snow is whitely falling, Each pretty girl looks down to find Her future husband's calling. The eldest sees a Castle bright, Girt round by shrubland shady; And, blushing bright, she feels in thought A lady rich already. The second sees a silver Ship, And bright and glad her face is; Oh, she will have a skipper bold, Grown rich in foreign places! The younger sees a glittering Crown, And starts in consternation; For Molly is too meek to dream Of reaching regal station! And time went by: one maiden got Her landsman, one her sailor— The Lackey of a country count, The Skipper of a whaler! And Molly has her Crown, although She unto few can show it— Her crown is true-love fancy-wrought, Her husband, a poor Poet! In the Library. TO A POET OF THE EMPIRE. Dear singing Brother, who so long Wore Galahad's white robe of Fame, And kept it stainless like thy name Thro' dreary days of doubting song; Who blest the seasons as they fell, Contented with the flowers they bring, Nor soar'd to Heaven on Milton's wing, Nor walked with Dante's ghost thro' Hell, But rather chose to dream at ease With Keats' mid ways thy gardener plan'd Beside a mimic lake to stand And see, just glimpsing thro' the trees, Thy marble statues brought from far, Dryad and Naiad white and still, And o'er the mead. above the hill, The twinkle of the Cyprian star; And on those plots of garden ground, Calm in thy sorrow and thy mirth, Leal to the Lords of Heaven and Earth, Thou dwelledst grave and laurel-crown'd; And peering down with curious eye, Polish'd with gentle art and long Thy faultless diamonds of song, And let the windy world go by; And heeded not the long despair Of souls that never see the sun, But to thy Maker cried ‘Well done,’ Since English pastures seemed so fair; And from the hovel to the Throne Beheld one perfect order'd plan; And praised the Christ as God and Man That wars were made and trumpets blown; Yea, deem'd this later greater Rome Supremely just and surely wise, And shut thine ears against the cries Of races slain beyond the foam That this our Empire might increase And this our Rome have silk and gold,— Nor heard across the blood-stain'd fold The Butcher-Shepherds crying, ‘Peace!’ Nor saw the thousand martyrs bowed Beneath the chariots of the Strong, But with thy wreaths of martial song Didst grace the triumphs of the Proud! Forgive, if to thy tomb I bring No garland such as maidens twine, But in the verse that Art made thine Proffer a votive offering! For tho' my soul was passion-rent, I knew thee good and kind and great, And prayed that no unkindly fate Might ever mar thy mild content! I loved thy pleachèd English lawn, Thy gracious girls, thy pastoral lyre, Nay, even thy Church and slender spire Pointing at Heaven so far withdrawn! And often have I prayed to be As calm, as much at peace with God,— Not moaning underneath His rod, But smiling at His feet, with thee! Wherefore accept these songs of mine, For I, being lesson'd long in grief, Believe despite my unbelief, Although my faith is far from thine! THE GNOME. (A FANTASY.) I. At Dusseldorf in the Bolkerstrass', In seventeen hundred and ninety-nine, A mystical meeting there came to pass, All in the pale moonshine. From every mountain and meadow-sward, From every forest around the Town, While the Mayor and the Corporation snored, The Elves came trooping down! And busily down in the silent street, Under the windows, they flitted there,— The Will-o'-the-Wisp and the Fay so fleet And the Troll with his tangled hair; Yea, all the spirits, black, blue, and red, Which philosophy long had driven away— From the white Undine with her starry head To the Gnome and the Goblin grey. And they cried, ‘Of dulness the world is sick, And the realistic reign hath passed— And the hour hath come (if we are but quick!) To revenge our wrongs at last— ‘For Man the mortal hath grown so wise, To Heaven he thrusteth his bumptious brow— He believes in nothing beneath the skies But the “ich” and the “nicht ich,” now! ‘Too grave to laugh and too proud to play, And full of a philosophic spleen, He walks the world in his browsing way, Like a jackass on a green. ‘He deems us slain with the creeds long dead, He stalks sole Master of earth and skies— But we mean, ere many an hour hath fled, To give him a slight surprise!’ And at Dusseldorf, as the moon sail'd by, When the City slept and the streets were still, The Elves at the trick they meant to try Laughed out full loud and shrill. II. Children by millions has Deutschland born, With brains to ponder and mouths to eat, But the strangest child saw light next morn In Dusseldorf, Bolker Street! Dim was his brow with the moon-dew dim, Large his eyes and of lustre clear, And he kick'd his legs with a laughter grim Smiling from ear to ear. A cry like the cry of the Elves and Gnomes Went up from the breast on which he lay, And he pucker'd his eyes and he showed his gums In the wonderful Elfin way. But his hair was bright as the sweet moonlight, And his breath was sweet as the breath of flowers, And looking up, on a starry night, He would lie and laugh for hours! And the human mother who watched his rest Did love the smile of his small weird face, While he drank, with the white milk of her breast, A loving and human grace. But night by night in the mystic shine The Spirits of meadow and mountain came, And moisten'd his lips with the Elfin wine And whisper'd his Elfin name! For the Elves and Gnomes had played their trick, Despite the Philosophers grim and grey— And a Gnome was growing, alive and quick, With a body and legs of clay! III. He drank the seasons from year to year And at last he grew to the height of man And at Hamburg, the City of girls and beer, The goblin-sport began. For up he leapt in the crowded street, All crown'd with ivy, and leaves, and flowers, And began a magical song, full sweet, Of the wonderful Elfin bowers. He sang of the pale Moon silvern shod, The Stars and the Spirits that feed their flame (But where others utter the praise of God He smiled, and he skipt the Name). Sweet as the singing of summer eves He sang in the midst of the wondering folk, And they saw the dew of the flowers and leaves On his white lips as he spoke! And he told of the beautiful woodland things Who glimmer naked without a blush, And he mimick'd the little birds with wings, The lark, and the finch, and the thrush! He told of the knight in the Pixy's cave Who sits like marble and hears her croon; Of the Water-spirits beneath the wave Who wail to the weary Moon. Wan were the faces of those that heard; They sighed for the mystical Elfin time; And they stood in a dream, with their spirits stirred To the thrill of that runic rhyme! But ever, just as the spell was done, He laughed as shrill as a bugle horn; And they rubbed their eyes in the garish sun To the sound of the Goblin's scorn! IV. Then over the Earth the tidings went, To the Kings above and the crowds below, That a Gnome, a magical Gnome, was sent To play his pranks below. ‘All things that are holy in mortal sight,’ Quoth those that gathered his pranks to see, ‘He turns, with a scrutiny mock-polite, To a goblin glamorie! ‘He dances his dance in the dark churchaisle, He makes grimaces behind Earth's Kings, He mocks, with a diabolical smile, The highest and holiest things. ‘He jeers alike at our gain and loss, He turns our faith to a goblin joke; He perches himself on the wayside Cross To grin at the kneeling folk! ‘He cutteth off our Madonna's head With golden hair and red lips beneath, And he sets on the fair one's throat instead A skull and grinning teeth! ‘Full of flowers are his eager hands As by Eve or Lilith he lies caressed, But he laughs! and they turn to ashes and sands, As he rains them upon her breast! ‘Nothing he spares 'neath the sad blue Heaven, All he mocks and regards as vain; Nothing he spares—not his own love even, Or his own despair and pain!’ V. Then some one (surely the son of a goose!) Cried, ‘Send the Philosophers after him! 'Tis an ignis jatuus broken loose, Or a Goblin wicked and grim. ‘For his sweetest sport is with sacred Kings, Of their holy persons he makes a game; And he strips our Queens of their splendid things And shows their naked shame! ‘He tricks the world in a goblin revel, He turns all substance to flowers and foam; Nothing he spares—not the very Devil, Or even the Pope of Rome!’ The Philosophers came, those wondrous men! They fronted the Gnome in his elfin glee, And they proved to demonstration, then, He wasn't, and couldn't be! And they showed him how in equation clear The Being and Being-not exist, And they proved that the only Actual here In the Werden must consist. See Hegel passim. They prodded his ribs with their fingerpoints, Proving he was not a fact at all;— And the Gnome laugh'd madly thro' all his joints And uttered his Elfin call. Around them the Goblin glamour grew, They turned to Phantoms and gazed askance, And he sprinkled their brows with the moonlight dew And led them a Devil's dance! They skipt along at his wicked beck, He left them, fool'd to their hearts' content— Each in his quagmire, up to the neck, Deep in the argument! VI. But the hand of the Human was on the Gnome, The lot he had chosen he must fulfil;— So a cry went out, over land and foam, That the wonderful Gnome was ill. Philosophers grey and Kings on their thrones Smiled and thought ‘He was long our pest; Our plague is sick—on his wicked bones The blight and the murrain rest!’ In Paris, the City of Sin and Light, In Matignon Avenue No. 3, Propt on his pillows he sat — a sight Most pitiful to see! For his cheeks were white as his own moon-shine, And his great head roll'd with a weary pain, And his limbs were shrunk, while his wondrous eyne Shone with a sad disdain. A skeleton form, with a thin white hand, He lay alone in the chamber dim; But he beckon'd and laugh'd—and all the land Of Faëry flock'd to him! Thro' his chamber window, when all was still, When Mathilde was sound, and Cocotte was dumb, Mathilde was the name of Madame Heine; Cocotte that of her pet parrot. On the moonbeam pale, o'er the window sill, Thronging he saw them come! In the City of absinthe and unbelief, The Encyclopædia's sceptic home, Fairies and Trolls, with a gentle grief, Surrounded the sickly Gnome. But at break of day, when Mathilde awoke And the parrot screamed, they had fled from there; While the sunrise red on the boulevard broke The pale Gnome dozed in his chair. But his eyes looked up with a mystic light, And his lips still laughed in the Elfin way, And the dew of the Vision he saw all night Was dim on his cheek all day! VII. In sad Montmartre there stands a tomb, Where the wonderful Gnome is lain asleep; And there, in the moonlight and the gloom, The Spirits of Elfland creep! The lot of the Human was on his life; He knew the sorrow of human breath;— The bitter fret and the daily strife, And the cruel human Death. But the Spirit that loves all shining things, The shapes of woodland and hill and stream, The flowers, and the wonderful birds with wings, And the Dream within the Dream,— The gentle Spirit looked down and said, ‘He hath drunk the mortal passion and pain; Let the balm of a mortal Sleep be shed On his weary heart and brain.’ And that is the reason he wakens not, Tho' ever and ever, at pale Moonrise, The spirits of Elfland haunt the spot Where ‘Heinrich Heine’ lies. THE WHITE ROBE; OR, ZOLA IN A NUTSHELL. I. At Paris, on the Champs Elysées, I sat and read Pot-Bouille through, Then felt like one whose lips are greasy After some sorry kitchen-stew; Then, putting Zola in my pocket, I watched Napoleon's arc of fame— Its open arch, like Death's eye-socket, Flush'd with flame. Beyond, the sun was sinking downward, And from the race-course, past the gate, Thousands were driving swiftly townward— Some merry, some disconsolate; While on the footpath gay crowds lingered Watching the bright cortège flow by, Lucifer pointed, fiery-fingered, From the sky. Herodias, by her lord attended, Faustine alone, in landau blue, La Gloria, with trappings splendid, And Plutus in her retinue; In their hired carriage, Mai and Mimi, Light-coated lovers at their side; Camille, consumption-mark'd and dreamy, Hollow-eyed. Then, all the glorious wedded ladies! Prudish or bold, I saw them pass; How like the rest whose busiest trade is Done in the night beneath the gas! Leaders of folly or of fashion, With splendour robed, with roses crowned, With eyes of prurience or of passion Smiling round! There, oiled and scented, white-waist-coated, The jolly bourgeois, coarse and fat, Lolled by his lady purple-throated In velvet robes and feathered hat. I stay'd, with Zola in my pocket, And watched till they had come and gone, Napoleon's arc, like Death's eye-socket, Glaring on! And all the foulness and obsceneness Of dress and form, of face and look, Answer'd the sadness and uncleanness That I had gathered from the book. My inmost soul was sick with Zola. I thought of sins without a name, I loathed the world, and thought the whole a Sink of shame! II. Just as I rose, with sorrow laden, Eager to leave the shameless sight, I saw close by a little Maiden Bareheaded in the sunset-light. In muslin robe of snowy whiteness, And one white lily in her hair, She paused, her pale cheek flush'd to brightness, Smiling there! Her mother, who had brought her thither, An ouvrieuse with travail bowed, Stood waiting to wend homeward with her Through the gay groups, the chattering crowd; Watched by that mother sad and tender, On the glad picture gazed the child; Then, glancing at her own white splendour, Proudly smiled. Presently, with a sigh of gladness, Turning, toward my seat she came, So feeble and slow, I saw with sadness She bore a crutch and she was lame; She came still nearer with her mother, And leaning on her crutch she stood; One slender limb was sound, the other Made of wood! And on the sound foot, small and pretty, One stocking white, one satin shoe! My soul grew full of pain and pity, My eyes were dim with tenderest dew; But ah! her face was bright with pleasure, Nor pained or peevish, sad or cross; Her heart too full that day to measure All her loss. 'Twas her first day of Confirmation; And many a month before that day The child, with eager expectation, Had longed to wear that white array; Then, that glad morning, in the City She had wakened long before the light, And stolen from bed, to seek her pretty Robe of White. And she had stood with many others— Poor little lambs of the same fold Watched fondly by their sad-eyed mothers, 'Neath the great Church's dome of gold; And while the holy light caressed them And solemn music went and came, The bishop had approved and blessed them In Christ's name! While the pale mother sat beside me, We talked together of the child, Who, listening proudly, stood and eyed me With soul astir and cheeks that smiled; Bright as a flower that blooms in Eden Fed with sweet dews and heavenly air, Was that poor lily of a Maiden Pure and fair. And as I looked in loving wonder The whole world brighten'd to my view, The dark sad sod was cleft asunder To let the flowers of light slip through; And lilies bright and roses blowing Dazzled my sense, while on mine ear Came sounds of winds and waters flowing Crystal clear! III. Down to the glad green Bois I wandered, The sun shone down on sward and tree; Around me, as I walked and pondered, The children shouted merrily; The lake was sparkling full of gladness. The song of birds trilled clear and gay, I listened, and the cloud of sadness Stole away. Then out I took, with fingers shrinking, My Zola, poisonous like the snake, And held him where the light was blinking O'er leaves of lilies on the lake. ‘Zola, my prophet of obsceneness,’ I murmured, ‘this at least is clear: Who seeks may ever find uncleanness, Even here. ‘And yet God made the world, and in it Caused buds of love and joy to bloom; Voices of innocence each minute Scatter the ravens of the tomb; E'en from the dreariest dust of sorrow Lilies of light may spring and shine, And from the Heaven above them borrow Hues divine. ‘The glad deep music of Creation, Abiding still though men depart, Transcends the song of tribulation Raised in your lazar-house of Art. He who would hear it must, upleaping, Face the full suntide of his Time, Nor, on the muddy bottom creeping, Search the slime! ‘One lily, wheresoever blowing, Can shame your sunless kitchen-weeds; One flower of joy, though feebly growing, Still justifies diviner creeds. There may be Hell, with mischief laden, There still is Heaven (look up and try!). So that poor lily of a Maiden Proves—you lie!’ I held him sunward for a minute, Then loosening fingers set him free: The water splashed; he vanished in it. Down to the muddy depths went he. The light flash'd out, no longer feeble, The waters sparkled where he fell. ‘Zola,’ I said, ‘enfant terrible, Fare-thee-well!’ Paris: June 1883. CARLYLE. ‘“If God would only do something,” I said. “He does nothing,” answered Carlyle.’ Froude's Life of Carlyle. I ‘God does nothing!’ sigh'd the Seer, Sick of playing Prophet: To his eyes the sun-flames clear Seem'd the fumes of Tophet; Off the King he tore his crown, Stript the Priest of clothing, Curst the world—then with a frown, Murmur'd, ‘God does—nothing!’ II Bitter creed, and creedless cry Of the soul despairing— He who once on sea and sky Saw the Portent flaring, He who chose the thorny road, Paths of pleasure loathing, Crying loudly, ‘Great is God, Only Man is nothing!’ III Many a year the merry world Flash'd its lights before him, Freedom's flag had been unfurl'd To the ether o'er him, Kings had fallen, empires changed, Suns of science risen, Innocence had been avenged, Truth had burst her prison. IV Having slain the serpent creeds, Knowledge, swift, Persean, On their grave had scatter'd seeds From the Empyrean; Godlike shapes had come and gone, Naked Nations clothing, While the Prophet sat alone, Sighing ‘God does—nothing!’ V Nothing? Whence, then, came the Light, Flashed across each Nation, Working after years of night Love's glad liberation? Whose the Voice that from the grave Cried, ‘Hell; fires I smother’? Whose the Hand that freed the slave? If not His, what other? VI Nay, but who was busy too In the Seer's own dwelling, Planting flowers of heavenly blue In a soul rebelling? Who was whispering, even then, Loving and not loathing, ‘Only he who hateth men Thinketh God does nothing!’ VII Strong and stubborn as the rock, Blindly sat the Prophet— Angels round his hearth might flock, Yet he reck'd not of it! Blind,—tho' one assumed the form Of a weary Woman, Shedding on his heart of stone Love divinely human! VIII Wrapt around with stoic pride Blind he sat each morrow— Whose, then, was the Voice that cried, ‘Smite his soul with sorrow’? Whose, then, was the shadowy Power Which to overcome him, Stooping as one plucks a flower, Took that other from him? IX Not alone on wings of storm, Nor in tones of thunder, Speaks the Voice and stirs the Form, While we watch and wonder; Still as falls the silent dew, Sweet'ning, sanctifying, He who stirs the suns can strew Lilies on the dying! X Darker grows the cloud, when we, Blind and helpless creatures, Face to face the Lord could see, Scrutinise His features! He who plans our loss or gain Works beyond our guessing— On the loneliest paths of pain Grows His sweetest blessing! XI Wouldst thou tear the clouds apart, Seeking sign or token? Look for God within thy heart, Tho' that heart be broken! All without thee—tempest-blown Darkness of Creation— Is a dream that needs thine own Life's interpretation! XII Seekest thou the God of wrath, In the Tempest calling? Or a Phantom in thy path, Slaying and appalling? Rather, when the light is low, Crouching silent near it, Seek Him in the ebb and flow Of thy breathing spirit! XIII See, the weary Prophet's grave! Calm and sweet it lieth, Hush'd, tho' still the human wave, Breaking blindly, crieth! He who works thro' quick and dead, Loving, never loathing, Blest this grey-hair'd child, who said Feebly, ‘God does—nothing!’ Mark now, how close they are akin, The worst man and the best,— The soul that least is touch'd with sin, And he that's sinfullest. From Shakespeare to the dullest knave That scans the poet's page, A step,—and lo, the same black grave Yawns both for fool and sage! A little life, a little sleep, A little hunger and thirst, A little time to laugh and weep, Unite the best and worst! Hush then thy pomp and pride, O Man! But humbly breathe and be,— The Law that was when life began Flows on thro' God and thee! ATYS. (TO CATULLUS.) ‘Stimulatus ubi furenti rabie, vagus animi.’ Cat., De Aty, 4. O Catullus, still among us strides the thing you celebrated, Flying yonder through the shadows where the modern mænads throng,— Sexless, sad, self-mutilated, that which God as Man created Wails in mad despair of manhood, beats the timbrel, shrills the song! Ah the pity! for the Muses round his cradle sang a pæan, Hover'd o'er him and around him where a happy child he ran, But he join'd the flocks Circean, drank the cursèd wine Lethean, And now the gods deny to it the birthright of a man! Ah, the pity!—oft there cometh from its lips that murmur madly A tone that still reminds us of the song that might have been! While the face that once shone gladly looms despitefully and sadly From the haunted Phrygian forest of the Goddess Epicene! DOCTOR B. (ON RE-READING A COLLECTION OF POEMS.) Confound your croakers and drug concoctors! I've sent them packing at last, you see! I'm in the hands of the best of doctors, Dear cheery and chirpy Doctor B.! None of your moping, methodistic, Long-faced ravens who frighten a man! No, ever with treatment optimistic To rouse the sick, is the Doctor's plan! In he comes to you, smiling brightly, Feels your pulse for the mere form's sake, Bustles about the sick room lightly. Gives you no beastly drugs to take, But blithely clapping you on the shoulder ‘Better?’ he cries. ‘Why, you're nearly well!’ And then you hear, with a heart grown bolder, The last good story he has to tell! And, mind you, his learning is prodigious, He has Latin and Greek at his finger ends, And with all his knowledge he's still religious, And counts no sceptic among his friends. God's in His Heaven, and willy nilly All things come right in the end, he shows— The rouge on the ladies of Piccadilly Is God's, as much as the blush of the rose! And as for the wail of the whole world's sorrow, Well, men may weep, but the thrushes sing! If you're sick to-day, there'll be jinks tomorrow, And life, on the whole, is a pleasant thing! When out of spirits you're sadly lying, All dismal talk he puts bravely by: ‘God's in His Heaven,’ you hear him crying,— ‘All's right with Creation from star to sty!’ Full of world's wisdom and life's variety, Always alive and alert is he, His patients move in the best society, And Duchesses swear by Doctor B.! A bit too chirpy to some folks' thinking? Well, there are moods that he hardly suits!— Once, last summer, when I felt sinking, I fear'd his voice and the creak of his boots! It he has a fault which there's no denying, Tis proneness to argue and prove his case,— When under the shadow a man is lying, Such boisterous comfort seems out of place; 'Tis little solace, when one is going Into the long eternal Night, To hear a voice, like a bugle blowing, Cry, ‘Glory to God, for the world's all right!’ I long'd, I own, for a voice less cheery, A style less strident, a tone less frce,— For one who'd bend by my bedside dreary And hush his wisdom and weep with me! But bless your heart, when my health grew better, I gladden'd the old boy's face to see; And still I consider myself the debtor Of dear old chirpy Doctor B.! SOCRATES IN CAMDEN. WITH A LOOK ROUND. (Written after first meeting the American poet, Walt Whitman, at Camden, New Jersey.) A pilgrim from beyond the seas, Seeking some shrine where shrines are few, I found the latter Socrates, Greek to the core, yet Yankee too; Feeble, for he was growing old, Yet fearless, self-contained, and bold, Rough as a seaman who has driven Long years before the winds of Heaven, I found him, with the blue skies o'er him, And, figuratively, knelt before him! Then gript the hand that long had lain Tenderly in the palm of Death, Saw the sweet eyes that still maintain Calm star-like watch o'er things of breath, And as the dear voice gave its greeting My heart was troubled unaware With love and awe that hush'd its beating And pride that darken'd into prayer. This man affirmed his disbelief In all the gods, but Belial mainly: Nature he loved, but Man in chief, And what Man is, he uttered plainly! Like Socrates, he mixed with men At the street corner, rough and ready, Christ-like he sought the Magdalen, Lifting his hat, as to a lady; No thing that breathes, however small, Found him unloving or rebelling; The shamble and the hospital Familiar were as his own dwelling; Then trumpet-like his voice proclaimed The naked Adam unashamed, The triumph of the Body, through The sun-like Soul that keeps it true, The triumph of the Soul, whereby The Body lives, and cannot die. The world was shocked, and Boston screaming Cover'd her face, and cried ‘For shame!’ Gross, hankering, mystically dreaming, The good grey Poet went and came; But when the dark hour loomed at last, And, lighted by the fiery levin, Man grappled man in conflict vast, While Christendom gazed on aghast, Through the great battlefield he pass'd With finger pointing up to Heaven. Socrates? Nay, more like that Other Who walked upon the stormy Sea, He brought, while brother wounded brother, The anointing nard of charity! But when the cruel strife was ended, Uprose the Elders, mob-attended, Saying, ‘This Socrates, it seems, Denies Olympus and blasphemes; Offends, moreover, 'gainst the Schools Who teach great Belial's moral rules, Sins against Boston and the Law That keeps the coteries in awe, And altogether for his swagger Deserves the hemlock cup or dagger!’ So said so done! The Pharisees Called up the guard and gave directions— The prison opened—Socrates Was left therein to his reflections! A full score years have passed, and still The good grey Bard still loafs and lingers; The social poison could not kill, Though stirred by literary fingers— He sipped it, smiled, and put it by, Despite the scandal and the cry; But when, the Pharisees commanding, They rushed to end him with the sword, They saw, beside the poet standing, A radiant Angel of the Lord. A hemlock cup? Yes, there it lies, Close to thy hand, old friend, this minute! With gentle twinkle of the eyes You mark the muddy liquid in it: For the grave rulers of the City, Who sent it, you have only pity; For those who mixed it, made it green With misconception, spite, and spleen, You feel no thrill of scornful fret, But only kindness and regret. 'Twas Emerson, some folk affirm, Who passed it round with shrug of shoulder— Good soul, he worshipped Time and Term, Instead of Pan, as he grew older! And Boston snubbed thee? Walt, true heart, Time ever brings about revenges— Just glance that way before we part And note the memorable changes. There, in the ‘hub’ of all creation, Where Margaret Fuller, ere she mated, Flirted with seers of reputation And all the ‘smis’ cultivated, Where still brisk Holmes cuts learnèd capers With buckles on knee-breeches fine, The sweet man-milliners and drapers, Howells and James, put up their sign. And there the modern Misses find The wares most suited to their mind— French fashions, farthingales delightful, Frills white as snow for ladies' wear; Nothing old-fashioned, fast, or frightful, Is dealt in by this dainty pair! The stuff they sell to man or woman May in itself be poor or common, Coarsest of serge or veriest sacking, But they can trick it in a trice, So that no element is lacking To render it extremely nice. ‘Ladies!’ they murmur, with a smile, ‘We pride ourselves upon our style! Our cutter is a paragon Match'd only by our fitter-on; Bring what material you like, We'll treat it in a way to strike, Turn your old satins, and embellish Last season's hats with feathers swellish! In short, weave miracles of clothing By genius out of next to nothing, And charge the very lowest prices For all our daintiest devices. We know,’ they add, with smirk and bow, ‘Some of you like old-fashioned clothes— The Emersonian homespun (now Absurd as Whitman's or Thoreau's), Or even, still absurder, seek Poor Shakespeare's fashion quite antique, Fit only, with its stiff brocades, For vulgar frumps and country maids; Could Shakespeare, poor old fellow, please With such a cut as this—chemise? The woof he used was strongly woven, But surely, now, his taste was shocking? Compare our silk hose, much approven, With Dickens' clumsy worsted stocking! We please the dames and gain the daughters With neat inventions of our own, Replace George Eliot's learned garters With our suspenders silken-sewn; While in an annex to the shop, Our customers will find, quite handy, The toothsome bun and lollipop And superfine molasses candy!’ The busy pair! How well they patter, Disposing of their slender matter; The girls adore, instead of loathing, These laurcates of underclothing, Delight their soul's attire to model On the last style of mollycoddle, Eked out with sickly importations From France, that naughtiest of nations! Dapper they are, and neatly dressed, Insidious, tempting folks to buy goods, But mere man-milliners at best Vending the flimsiest of dry goods; Trash in their flimsy window setting, And tricking up to catch the eye Such clothes as spoil with the first wetting From the free rains of yonder sky! Daintily passing by their shop, Sometimes, when it is cloudless weather, Aldrich, a literary fop, In trim tight boots of patent leather, Strolls to the quiet street, where he saw Sun-freckled Marjorie play at see-saw, And bending o'er her hammock, kisses That sweetest, shadowiest of misses! His languid gait, his dudish drawl, His fopdom, we forgive them all, For her dear sake of his creating, Fairer than girls of flesh and blood, Who, never loving, never mating, Swings in eternal Maidenhood! Now I conjure thee, best of Bards, Scatter thy wisdom Bostonwards! Tell Howells, who with fingers taper Measures the matron and the maid, God never meant him for a draper— Strip off his coat, give him a spade! His muscles and his style may harden If he digs hard in Adam's garden, Or follows Dudley Warner flying Where Adirondack eagles soar, Or chums with some brown savage, lying With Stoddard on a South-sea shore. Tell James to burn his continental Library of the Detrimental, And climb a hill, or take a header Into the briny, billowy seas, Or find some strapping Muse and wed her, Instead of simpering at teas! How should the Titaness of nations, Whose flag o'er half a world unfurls, Sit listening to the sibilations Of shopmen twittering to girls? She sees the blue skies bend above her, She feels the throb of hearts that love her, She hears the torrent and the thunder, The clouds above, the waters under, She knows her destiny is shaping Beyond the dreams of Linendraping! She craves a band of Bards with voices To echo her when she rejoices, To sing her sorrows and to capture The Homeric music of her rapture! She hears the good grey Poet only Sing, priestly-vestured, prophet-eyed, And on his spirit falls the lonely Light of her splendour and her pride. . . . Poet divine, strong soul of fire, Alive with love and love's desire, Whose strength is as the Clouds, whose song Is as the Waters deep and strong, Whose spirit, like a flag unfurled, Proclaims the freedom of the World, What gifts of grace and joy have come Out of thy gentle martyrdom! A pilgrim from afar, I bring Homage from some who love thee well— Ah, may the feeble song I sing Make summer music in thy cell! The noblest head 'neath western skies, The tenderest heart, the clearest eyes, Are thine, my Socrates, whose fate Is beautifully desolate! As deep as Hell, as high as Heaven, Thy wisdom hath this lesson given, When all the gods that reign'd and reign Have fallen like leaves and left no sign, The god-like Man shall still remain To prove Humanity divine! Indian Rock, Philadelphia, Pa.: March 1885. WALT WHITMAN. One handshake, Walt! while we, thy little band Of lovers, take our last long look at thee— One handshake, and one kiss upon the hand Thou didst outreach to bless Humanity! The dear, kind hand is cold, the grave sweet eyes Are closed in slumber, as thou liest there. We shed no tears, but watch in sad surmise The face still smiling thro' the good grey hair! No tears for thee! Tears rather, tears of shame, For those who saw that face yet turn'd away; Yet even these, too, didst thou love and claim As brethren, tho' they frown'd and would not stay. And so, dear Walt, thine Elder Brother passed, Unknown, unblest, with open hand like thine— Till lo! the open Sepulchre at last, The watching angels, and the Voice Divine! God bless thee, Walt! Even Death may never seize Thy gifts of goodness in no market priced— The wisdom and the charm of Socrates, Touch'd with some gentle glory of the Christ! So long!—We seem to hear thy voice again, Tender and low, and yet so deep and strong! Yes, we will wait, in gladness not in pain. The coming of thy Prophecy. (‘So long!’) THE STORMY ONES. What bark is this by the breezes driven, With scarce a rag of remaining sail?— Under the gentle eyes of Heaven It drifteth, crowded with faces pale. Who's at the helm with his hair back blowing (And very badly he seems to steer)? Loosely his raven locks are flowing,— The shade of Byron, by all that's queer! Close beside him a blushing bevy Of women on tiger-skins repose,— Their cheeks are waxen, their eyes are heavy, They wear loose trousers, and yawn and doze! Daintily drest but sea-sick slightly, Leans Chateaubriand over the rail, Watch'd by an Indian maid politely, A sort of Choctaw Madame de Stael. There's Grillparzer, with scowl and swagger, Kotzebue also, with paper and pen, Werner, with poison'd bowl and dagger, All the stormy women and men! Atala, Charlotte, Medora, Haidee, Mrs. Haller, may be descried, Fair of feature, in morals shady, Caressed and wheedled,—then kick'd aside! Down below in the cabin, thickly Gather the revellers, weak of will— Alfred de Musset with smile so sickly, Heine with laughter wild and shrill. Women, too!—actress, cocotte, and gipsy, Mimi Pinson, and all the rest, Each bareheaded, with eyeballs tipsy, Leaning there on a reveller's breast. Poof! how close it is below here! Best again to the deck repair— At least a breath from Heaven may blow here, But down in the cabin, one chokes for air! Byron swears as he grasps the tiller, Haidee sobs as she bites her bun, And the little stowaway, Joaquin Miller, Gapes at a symbol and cries ‘What fun!’ For up at the peak their flag is flying— A white Death's head, with grinning teeth,— ‘Eat, drink, and love, for the day is dying’ Written in cypher underneath. ‘Vanity! Vanity! Love and Revel!’ ‘Take a sip of absinthe, my dear!’ ‘Religion's a bore, but I like the Devil!’ These are some of the words you hear!. . . Over the vessel so small and crowded, Walking the winds with solemn tread, Two shapes are hanging, their faces shrouded,— They talk as they hearken overhead.SPIRIT OF ROUSSEAU. Why rocks this ship upon the main When all the waves repose?SPIRIT OF GOETHE.The breeze is only in the brain, And so they think it blows!SPIRIT OF ROUSSEAU. But all is calm—'tis summer-time— Soft sighs the silken swell!SPIRIT OF GOETHE.Still, you and I dream'd ere our prime Our Teacup Storms as well! Still as glass is the ocean weather, All is quiet and still and warm, Yet see! the Stormy Ones crowd together, Baring their foreheads to front the Storm! ‘Thunder and lightning, we defy you! Fate, we scorn thee!’ loud they cry— ‘Blow your loudest, O wind on high! You Can only make us blaspheme and die!’SPIRIT OF ROUSSEAU. Methinks the song they sing is stale, So oft it hath been sung!SPIRIT OF GOETHE. That very vessel thro' a gale I steered, when I was young!SPIRIT OF ROUSSEAU. Why do they rave of tempests thus? The weather's wondrous fair!SPIRIT OF GOETHE.Herr God! 'tis too ridiculous— There's not a breath of air! Spirits tremendous, you're right precisely! The song of the Stormy is quite absurd— There's just a breeze to sail with nicely, The waves are gentle to boat and bird. Yonder Liberty's Ark is floating, And there's the Dove, with the branch in his beak— Even the Pope on the brine is boating, Safe in his tub, in spite of the leak! Go by, O Stormy Ones, dreaming wildly You breast the waves with heroic mind— On your brows may the breeze blow mildly, When you're sea-sick, may Fate be kind! But O ye Women, black-eyed and blue-eyed, Who listen still to the old stale song, Ye victims of mock-heroics! true-eyed, Credulous, innocent, spite of wrong! Yours is the sorrow, theirs the pleasure,— Yours are the tears, and theirs the laugh,— The cowards sip the froth of the measure, But give you the poisonous dregs to quaff! Lords of misrule and of melancholy, They share among you their devil's dole, While on the decks of that Ship of Folly You faint and sicken, O Woman-Soul! THE DISMAL THRONG. The Fairy Tale of Life is done, The horns of Fairyland cease blowing, The Gods have left us one by one, And the last Poets, too, are going! Ended is all the mirth and song, Fled are the merry Music-makers; And what remains? The Dismal Throng Of literary Undertakers! Clad in deep black of funeral cut, With faces of forlorn expression, Their eyes half open, souls close shut, They stalk along in pale procession; The latest seed of Schopenhauer, Born of a Trull of Flaubert's choosing, They cry, while on the ground they glower, ‘There's nothing in the world amusing!’ There's Zola, grimy as his theme, Nosing the sewers with cynic pleasure, Sceptic of all that poets dream, All hopes that simple mortals treasure; With sense most keen for odours strong, He stirs the Drains and scents disaster, Grim monarch of the Dismal Throng Who bow their heads before ‘the Master.’ There's Miss Matilda in the south, There's Valdes in Madrid and Seville, There's mad Verlaine with gangrened mouth Grinning at Rimbaud and the Devil. From every nation of the earth, Instead of smiling music-makers, They come, the foes of Love and Mirth, The Dismal Throng of Undertakers. There's Tolstoi, towering in his place O'er all the rest by head and shoulders; No sunshine on that noble face Which Nature meant to charm beholders! Mad with his self-made martyr's shirt, Obscene through hatred of obsceneness, He from a pulpit built of Dirt Shrieks his Apocalypse of Cleanness! There's Ibsen, puckering up his lips, Squirming at Nature and Society, Drawing with tingling finger-tips The clothes off naked Impropriety! So nice, so nasty, and so grim, He hugs his gloomy bottled thunder; To summon up one smile from him Would be a miracle of wonder! There's Maupassant, who takes his cue From Dame Bovary's bourgeois troubles; There's Bourget, dyed his own sick ‘blue,’ There's Loti, blowing blue soap-bubbles; There's Mendès (no Catullus, he!) There's Richepin, sick with sensual passion. The Dismal Throng! So foul, so free, Yet sombre all, as is the fashion. ‘Turn down the lights! put out the Sun! Man is unclean and morals muddy, The Fairy Tale of Life is done, Disease and Dirt must be our study! Tear open Nature's genial heart, Let neither God nor gods escape us, But spare, to give our subjects zest. The basest god of all—Priapus!’ The Dismal Throng! 'Tis thus they preach, From Christiania to Cadiz, Recruited as they talk and teach By dingy lads and draggled ladies; Without a sunbeam or a song, With no clear Heaven to hunger after; The Dismal Throng! the Dismal Throng! The foes of Life and Love and Laughter! By Shakespeare's Soul! if this goes on, From every face of man and woman The gift of gladness will be gone, And laughter will be thought inhuman! The only beast who smiles is Man! That marks him out from meaner creatures! Confound the Dismal Throng, who plan To take God's birth-mark from our features! Manfreds who walk the hospitals, Laras and Giaours grown scientific, They wear the clothes and bear the palls Of Stormy Ones once thought terrific; They play the same old funeral tune. And posture with the same dejection, But turn from howling at the moon To literary vivisection! And while they loom before our view, Dark'ning the air that should be sunny, Here's Oscar growing dismal too, Our Oscar who was once so funny! Blue china ceases to delight The dear curl'd darling of society, Changed are his breeches, once so bright, For foreign breaches of propriety! I grant there's many a sorry place On Earth, and much in need of mending, But all the world is not so base As sickly souls are now contending; And I prefer my roses still To all the garlic in their garden— Let Hedda gabble as she will, I'll stay with Rosalind, in Arden! O for one laugh of Rabelais, To rout these moralising croakers! (The cowls were mightier far than they, Yet fled before that King of Jokers). O for a slash of Fielding's pen To bleed these pimps of Melancholy! O for a Boz, born once again To play the Dickens with such folly Yet stay! why bid the dead arise? Why call them back from Charon's wherry? Come, Yankee Mark, with twinkling eyes, Confuse these ghouls with something merry! Come, Kipling, with thy soldiers three, Thy barrack-ladies frail and fervent, Forsake thy themes of butchery And be the merry Muses' servant! Come, Dickens' foster-son, Bret Harte! (Before he died, he bless'd thy labours!) Tom Hardy, blow the clouds apart With sound of rustic fifes and tabors! Dick Blackmore, full of homely joy, Come from thy garden by the river, And pelt with fruit and flowers, old boy, These dreary bores who drone for ever! By Heaven! we want you one and all, For Hypochondria is reigning— The Mater Dolorosa's squall Makes Nature hideous with complaining. Ah! who will paint the Face that smiled When Art was virginal and vernal— The pure Madonna with her Child, Pure as the light, and as eternal! Pest on these dreary, dolent airs! Confound these funeral pomps and poses! Is Life Dyspepsia's and Despair's, And Love's complexion all chlorosis? A lie! There's Health, and Mirth, and Song, The World still laughs, and goes a-Maying— The dismal droning doleful Throng Are only smuts in sunshine playing! Play up, ye horns of Fairyland! Shine out, O Sun, and planets seven! Beyond these clouds a beckoning Hand Gleams from the lattices of Heaven! The World's alive—still quick, not dead, It needs no Undertaker's warning; So put the Dismal Throng to bed, And wake once more to Light and Morning! THE GIFT OF BURNS. (Addressed to the Caledonian Club, Boston, U.S.A., on the Anniversary of the Birth of the Poet.) I The speech our English Pilgrims spoke Fills the great plains afar, And branches of the British oak Wave 'neath the Western star; ‘Be free!’ men cried, in Shakespeare's tongue, When striking for the Slave— Thus Hampden's cry for Freedom rung As far as Lincoln's grave! II But where new oaks of England rise The thistle freelier blows; Across the seas 'neath alien skies Another Scotland grows; Here Independence, mountain Maid Reaps her full birthright now, And Burns's shade, in trews and plaid, Still whistles at the plough! III Scots, gather'd now in phalanx bright, Here in this distant land, To greet you all, this festal night, I reach the loving hand; My soul is with you one and all, Who pledge our Poet's fame, And echoing your toast, I call A blessing on his name! IV The heritage he left behind Has spread from sea to sea— The liberal heart, the fearless mind, The undaunted Soul and free; The radiant humour that redeem'd A world of commonplace; The wit that like a sword-flash gleam'd In Fashion's painted face; V The brotherhood whose smiles and tears, Too deep for thought to scan, Have made of all us Mountaineers One world-compelling clan! Hand join with hand! Soul links with soul Where'er we sit and sing, Flashing, from utmost pole to pole, Love's bright electric ring! VI The songs he sang were sown as seeds Deep in the furrow'd earth— They blossom into dauntless deeds And flowers of gentle mirth; They brighten every path we tread, They conquer Time and place; While blue skies, opening overhead, Reveal—the Singer's face! VII God bless him! Tho' he sin'd and fell, His sins are all forgiven, Since with his wit he conquer'd Hell, And with his love show'd Heaven! He was the noblest of us all, Yet of us all a part, For every Scot, howe'er so small, Is high as Burns's heart! VIII All honour'd be the night indeed When he this life began— The open-handed, stubborn-knee'd Type of the mountain clan! The shape erect that never knelt To Kings of earth or air, But at a maiden's touch would melt And tremble into prayer! IX His soul pursues us where we roam, Beyond the furthest waves, He sheds the light of Love and Home Upon our loneliest graves! Poor is the slave that honours not The flag he first unfurl'd— Our Singer, who has made the Scot The Freeman of the World! THE ROBIN REDBREAST. (FOR ROBERT BURNS'S BIRTHDAY, 25TH JANUARY.) When cold and frosted lies the plough And never a flower upsprings, How blithely on the wintry bough The Robin sits and sings! His bright black eye with restless ray Glints at the snow-clad earth; Chill blow the winds, and yet his lay Is bright with Love and Mirth! . . . E'en so, my Robin, didst thou come Into our wintry clime, And when the summer bards were dumb Piped out thy perfect rhyme; Clouds parted, and the sun shone through! Men welcomed, smiling bright, The Friend of Man, the Minstrel true Of Love, and Life, and Light! Poor outcast Adam ceased to grieve, And answer'd with a will: 'Twas Eden once again, and Eve Was mother-naked still! And ever by the Cotter's door, Thy notes rang clear and frce, And Freedom fill'd the soul once more That hearken'd unto thee! The crimson stain was on thy breast, The bleeding heart below, But bravely thou didst pipe thy best Despite the whole world's woe! Blest be that strain of Love and Mirth, So fearless and so fine! . . . What were this waste of wintry earth Without such cheer as thine! TO GEORGE BERNARD SHAW. No slave at least art thou, on this dull Day When slaves and knaves throng in Life's banquet-hall! . . . Who listens to thy scornful laugh must say ‘Wormwood, tho' bitter, is medicinal!’ Because thou turnest from our Feast of Lies Where prosperous priests with whores and warriors feed, Because thy Jester's mask hides loving eyes, I name thee here, and bid thy work ‘God speed!’ THE SAD SHEPHERD. (TO THOMAS HARDY.) Thy song is piteous now that once was glad, The merry uplands hear thy voice no more— Thro' frozen forest-ways, O Shepherd sad, Thou wanderest, while windy tempests roar; And in thine arms—aye me!—thou claspest tight A wounded Lamb that bleateth in the cold, Warming it in thy breast, while thro' the night Thou strugglest, fain to bear it to the fold! Shepherd, God bless thy task, and keep thee strong To help poor lambs that else might die astray! . . . Thy midnight cry is holier than the song The summer uplands heard at dawn of day! L'ENVOI IN THE LIBRARY. And if, O Brethren of the Bleeding Heart, Dreamers amid the Storm where Love gropes blind, I have cried aloud for Joy to tear apart The cloud of Fate that broods o'er Humankind; If 'mid the darkness I have call'd, ‘Rejoice! God's in His Heaven—the skies are blue and fair!’ If for a moment's space my faltering voice Hath echoed here the infant's cry and prayer; 'Tis that the pang of pity grew too great, Too absolute the quick sharp sense of pain, And in my soul's despair, left desolate, I sought to be a little child again! Not that I love your piteous labours less, But that I yearn for Life and Sunshine more,— Hearing, 'mid Seas and Storms so pitiless, The happy children shouting on the shore! CORUISKEN SONNETS. See the author's ‘Book of Orm.’ (Loch Coruisk, Isle of Skye, N.B.) I Again among the Mountains, and again That same old question on my faltering tongue! Purged if not purified by fires of pain, I seek the solitudes I loved when young; And lo, the prayers I prayed, the songs I sung, Echo like elfin music in my brain, While to these lonely regions of the Rain I come, a Pilgrim worn and serpent-stung. The bitter wormwood of the creeds hath pass'd To poison in my blood of dull despair, I have torn the mask from Death and stood aghast To find the Phantom's features foul not fair, I have read the Riddle of the Gods at last With broken heart, and found no comfort there! II Unchanged, Coruisk, thou liest!—Time hath made No mark on thee his empery to attest; Winter and summer, light and solemn shade, Break not the eternal darkness of thy breast, Black Lake of Sorrow, stillest, woefullest Of all God's Waters,—countless storms have played O'er thee and round, since on thy shores I prayed And left thee here untroubled in thy rest. . . And o'er thee still the sunless Peaks arise Finding no mirror in thy depths below, And night by night Heaven with its million eyes Hath watch'd thy lava-pools of silent woe,— The same thou art, under the same sad Skies, As when God's Hand first stilled thee, long ago! III Tho' Time which leaves thee whole hath rent and worn The soul of him who stood and worshipt here, The weary Waters and the Hills forlorn Remain the same from silent year to year;— Despite the sad unrest afar and near, The cry of Torrents that for ever mourn, The march of Clouds by winds and lightnings torn, Here dwells no heritage of human fear! God keeps His scourge for slaves that pray and cling, For Clouds and Mists and mortals frail as they,— The Mountains heed Him not, the Waters fling His strong Hand back and wave His pride away: Serene and silent they confront the Thing Which chills the flesh and blood of men of clay! IV Now hearken!—Led, methought, by God's own Hand, I wander'd in a world of gracious things, Heaven was above, all round was Fairyland, Music of singing brooks and crystal springs,— Each flower that blossoms and each bird that sings Promised the Paradise which Love had planned, Spake of the spirits who at his command Bare peace from star to star on happy wings. I heard the Promise wheresoe'er I went, I saw it rainbow'd yonder in the Sky, Yea, even when the Heavens were lightningrent, I saw the radiant hosts go shining by,— I look'd and listen'd, calm and well-content, And little guess'd that Promise was a Lie! V How could I doubt the lark and nightingale Singing their chaunt of Joy and Love Divine? How could I dream that golden Light could fail Which lit the whole green world with bliss like mine? Where'er I walked I saw the Promise shine Soft as the dawn-star o'er a leafy dale, And raising happy hands I cried, ‘All hail! Father of All, since Life and Light are Thine!’ Nay, even when utter darkness wrapt me round And bending low I saw pale Death creep near, Methought I saw an Angel Heavenwardbound Laden with flowers that bloom'd and faded here, While far away I heard a happy sound And saw the Mirage flash from sphere to sphere! VI The Mirage! ah, the Mirage! O how fair And wonderful it seem'd, flashed overhead From world to world! Bright faces glimmer'd there, Hands beckon'd, and my grief was comforted! Wherefore, O God, I did not fear to tread That darkness, and to breathe that deadly air, For there was comfort yet in my despair, And since God lived, I was not wholly dead! Then came the crowning grief, the final fear That snapt my heart in twain, Unpitying One! The Hand was drawn away, the path grew drear, The Mirage faded, and the Dream was done; And lo, the Heaven that once had seem'd so near Had fled, to shine no more in moon or sun! VII I charge Thee now, O God, if God indeed Thou art, and not an evil empty Dream! Now when the Earth is strong and quick with seed, Redeem Thy promise! with Thy life supreme Fill those dear eyes, till they unclose and beam! Think how my heart hath bled and still doth bleed Beneath Thy wrath, and listen while I plead In darkness,—send Thy Light, a living stream, Into the grave where all I love lies low!. . . Spring comes again, Thy world awakeneth, May-time is near, the buds begin to blow, Over all Nature flows a living breath,— The Hills are loosen'd and the Waters flow,— Melt then, O God, those icicles of Death! VIII Thou wilt not melt them! Never in sun or rain The gentle heart shall stir, the dear eyes shine! Silent Thou passest, pitiless, Divine, Trailing behind Thy footsteps Life's long chain, Which breaketh link by link with ceaseless pain, Breaketh and faileth like this life of mine, And yet is evermore renew'd again To prove all Time's Eternity is Thine! Wherefore my soul no more shall pray and cling To Thee, O God, for succour or for stay;— The Mountains heed Thee not,—the Waters fling Thy strong Hand back and wave Thy pride away:— Serene and cold like those, I front the Thing Which chills the flesh and blood of men of clay. THE DEVIL'S SABBATH. (Loch Coruisk, Island of Skye. Night.) THE ÆON. Welcome, Buchanan! once again I greet you Here 'mong the Mountains as in London yonder! Right glad am I in mine own realm to meet you, Far from the haunts where priests and pedants wander. Once more I thank you for your vindication Of one so long malign'd in foolish fiction! Your book ‘The Devil's Case: A Bank Holiday Interlude.’ shall long survive the execration Of critics through your Master's benediction! You've reconstructed, much as fools have slighted you, The one true Jesus and the one true Devil. Wherefore to prove our love we've now invited you To join our new Walpurgis-Night, and revel! THE POET. What heights are those that rise so sadly o'er me? What waters sad are those beneath me sleeping? Dark as a dream the shadows part before me And show the snow-white gleam of torrents leaping! THE ÆON. This is the lonely Corry of the Water By which you walked and sung in days departed; And she who stands beside me is my daughter, Last of the maiden Muses merry-hearted; The others left the land when Byron perish'd, But she, the fruit of sad amours and stealthy, Lived on, a sickly child, the deeplier cherish'd Because she never has been strong or healthy. VOICES. From rock to rock, Still faster and faster, Upward we flock At thy call, O Master! THE POET. What shapes are these? THE ÆON. Sinners and sages Of all degrees, Sexes, and ages! Poor devils, how blindly they grope about, Thinking they climb but never succeeding! As they wind like serpents in and out, Their mouths are panting, their lips are bleeding! NEW MUSE. Hilló! hilló! come hither to me! VOICES. We hear thy voice, but we cannot see Thy face, O Lady of Love and Light! Upward, upward like sparks we flee, Blown in the winds of the woeful night! Thine old wild tunes in our brains are ringing, Tho' we are weary and spirit-sore, Singing, singing, and upward springing, Whither we know not, ever more! SHE SINGS. Sing me a song of the Dove And the Hawk that slew him! From a golden heaven above Eyes like the eyes of thy love Gazed downward to him! Sing me the song of the Dove And the Hawk that slew him! VOICES. Room for the Wisdom! Stand aside! Here he cometh goggle-eyed, Solver of the great I AM, Scorner of the Snake and Lamb, Measurer of space and time, Up the steep path see him climb, Vacant heir of all the ages, First of Fools and last of Sages. See! he stoops and from the ground Lifteth something large and round, Smiles, and nods, and looks profound,— Hither, Master! Faster, faster, Show us now what thou hast found! THE WISE MAN. A trifle! yet even to one so ripe In knowledge as I, the one thing needed,— The missing skull of the Archetype Whence our father Adam the First pro ceeded! THE MUSE. Hilló! Hilló! come hither to me. VOICES. We hear thy voice, but we cannot see Thy face, O Lady of Love and Light! Upward, upward we struggle and flee, Blown in the winds of this woeful night! THE MUSE. Sing me a song of a Tree And the fruit forbidden! Of a fool who sought to see What from God himself is hidden! Weary and sad stands he, By his children's children chidden, Under the Cross of the Tree Of the fruit forbidden! THE POET. What is yonder priestly train Struggling upward through wind and rain? THE ÆON. Those are the priests of Priapus. Sadly They worship the God of the Grove, not gladly As in the frolicsome days departed When men and women were innocent-hearted— The phallic emblems you may espy Looming crimson against the sky, But now they are hung with weeds, instead Of pure white lilies and roses red, And none of the faithful dare to pay Their duty to them in open day! THE POET. Pause here! How peaceful and how still Is this green glade on the moonlit hill,— The tumult dies to a peaceful call Like the hum of a distant waterfall! Here is a porch of marble red that leads Into a roofless Temple thick with weeds, And yonder in the shadow I can see The glimmer of some nude Divinity. But who is this who lifts his lonely head Far from the eddying throng that yonder groans? His face is calm and godlike, and his tread Royal and proud, as if he walk'd on thrones; Gravely he stands and muses, listening From time to time to those faint human cries! THE ÆON. Knowest thou not the last Apollo, King Of the unpitying heart and eagle eyes? The place is calm, yet (cast thine eyes around) 'Tis strewn with marble bones of Gods long sped,— Creatures obscene are crawling on the ground, And yonder Venus armless is, and dead! THE POET. Nay, something stirs 'mid yonder shadows! See! She wrings her hands and moans, and looks at me! THE ÆON. Peace with thee, Gretchen!. . . Hark, her piteous cry Rings through the grove and echoes to the sky! And lo, the mad tumultuous crowd Beneath us answer, laughing loud! ‘By the pinching of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes!’ Hilló, hilló! this way, this way! Shrieking stumbling things of clay, Nymphs and Satyrs of To-day! THE POET. Alas, why break a peace so calm and stately With clamour of the hogs from Circe's pen? THE ÆON. The demigod's conceit annoys me greatly, And so I love to vex him now and then. Have no fear, they will not stay, Just one rush and they're away, From the sty and from the street Fast they flock and on they fleet. See! my kinsman, goat-foot Pan, And Silenos on his ass, Catamites and harlots wan Follow shrieking through the grass, Herodias and Magdalen Clashing cymbals head the throng, Naked maids and maniac men Follow them with dance and song. Bring the boon he once loved well, Rain it on his frozen heart; Break the spell with shouts from Hell, Grieve the godhead and depart! A VOICE. What ho, you things of dirt and dust, I come with news that must surprise you,— But first lie down, my Lady of Lust, Giggling nymph with the swelling bust! Let us dissect and anatomise you! VOICES. Whence do you come, and what is your name? VOICE. My name's Peer Gynt, and I come from Thulé! VOICES. Return, old fellow, from whence you came, Or join our sports and be honoured duly. VOICE. I join your infamous pagan revel! I, the apostle of Truth and Sanity!— My task it is to expose the Devil And all his plottings against Humanity! Wherever the cloven foot has been I trace the proofs and the signs obscene; Wherever your naked Venus stands I hold the mirror of Truth before her,— In vain she seizes with trembling hands A scarf or a shift and flings it o'er her! O Sin, my friends, is everywhere, In the song of the birds, in the light of the air, In the baby's prattle, the virgin's kiss, In the mother's love, in the lover's bliss, And Sin and Death since the world's creation Have led to eternal and deep damnation. Here are comrades three times three Who preach the gospel of Sin with me! We charge you now in the Name Divine To leave the pleasures ye think so fine, To quit these heights where the Devil prowls, And come to our Heaven of Ghosts and Ghouls. THE ÆON. By Hell and all its lights profane, ‘'Tis good John Calvin risen again!— How busily the peddling knave Searches about for souls to save; Yet Conscience, to a fine art turn'd, Loses the wisdom fools have learn'd, And he who augur-like broods o'er The beast's foul entrails evermore, Or searches all his soul and skin For specks of filth or spots of sin, May busy be among his kind But lacks his birthright and grows blind. Nay, Life's full cup, howe'er so brittle, Is better than a stinking skull! Men mope too much and live too little, And thus grow functionless and null. Leave to green girls and criticasters That hide-bound throng of Little Masters, And let us hasten onward, flying To yonder heights of snow-white flame, Where throngs of spirits multiplying Are loudly calling out my name. ELFIN VOICES. The bugle blows from the elfin dells With a hark and a hey halloo,— Fays of the Glens, of the Crags and Fells, Come hither and join our crew! ECHOES. We come, we come, from the crags and fells— Hark! hark! halloo! halloo! THE POET. Stay, for I know you, Shapes divine Who hover'd round me long ago,— Stay, on this way-worn heart of mine Pour the glad peace it used to know! THE ELFINS. The bugle is blowing from height to height Under the skies o' blue, We fly, we fly thro' the shining night With a hark and a hey halloo! ECHOES. Halloo! halloo! halloo! THE POET. From crag to crag, from peak to peak, I follow swiftly where ye fly,— O stay, sweet Shapes, and on my cheek Breathe gently as in days gone by! Alas! they hear but will not stay; They come, they smile, and fade away! THE ÆON. Pause here,—where from the topmost height The torrent hangs its scarf of white, And while the phantom shapes slip by, Behold the Boy who cannot die, With face turn'd upward to the sky! THE POET. Aye me, I know him, and he seems Mine other brighter self long dead,— Smiling he sits alone and dreams, While the wild cataract leaps and gleams From rock to rock above his head. THE BOY. Waterfall, waterfall, Would that I were you! To leap and leap, and call and call All night through! Pausing, pausing far up there, Plunging downward thro' the air, Ever resting, ever flowing, Ever coming, ever going, Calling, calling, Falling, falling. Where the heather bells are blowing, Underneath the blue! Morning tide and evenfall, And all night thro', You leap and leap, and call and call! Would that I were you! (He gazes into the pool.) Fay of the Fall, I can see you there, Dancing down in the pools below me,— You leap and laugh like a lady fair, Naked, white footed, with wild bright hair, And cool spray-kisses you love to throw me. I can see your face through its veil of foam, When you pause a space in the bright moon-ray, Combing your locks with a silver comb, Then vanishing merrily away! I think you are living, Fay of the Fall, Though you are great and I am small; The clouds are living, the winds are living, The trees, the heather, the grass, are living And I am living among them all! (A pause. He speaks again.) Who walks yonder over the height? (Hush! hush! 'Tis she! 'tis she!) I know you, Lady of the Light, Holding high, with your hand so white, Your silver lamp,—you search for me! Silent I crouch in the shade of the hill, And the voices around are hushed and still But my heart throbs loudly unaware, For I hear you murmuring, ‘Is he there?’ Yonder up in the sky you stand, Naked and bright, with your maidens round you, And suddenly one of the shining band Leaps down to touch me, and cries, ‘We've found you!’ Moon-Fay, Moon-Fay, Maid of the Night, You turn my face up like a flower, And the smile of the Lady of the Light Falls on my cheeks like a silver shower! Hold me close and clasp me round, Moon-Fay, Moon-Fay, while I gaze! Naked, beautiful, golden-crown'd, Your Queen stands there with her troops of Fays. She lifts her finger and past they fly, Everywhere, everywhere under the sky, To find the wonderful living things, Those that fly, and those that creep, To light the dark with their luminous wings, And to kiss the eyelids of folk asleep! Onward and round with a fairy sound One whirls in your arms, O Waterfall! The Moon is living, the Fays are living, The trees, the winds, and the grass are living, And I am living among them all! (A pause. He closes his eyes.) The Waterfall is sleepy, like me! Its voice sounds faint and far away— Close my eyelids with kisses three, And pillow my head on your breast, dear Fay! ELFIN VOICES. The bugle blows from the Elfin dells With a hark and a hey halloo! Fays of the Glens, of the Crags and Fells, Come hither and join our crew! This Boy was born where our sisters weep, 'Mong weary women and men,— This night we gather around his sleep He has summers seven and ten— Sound asleep in the white moonbeam His head on his arm he lies,— Come with our flowers from the Land of Dream And rain them on his eyes! A VOICE. What will you give him? ANOTHER. The gift of dreaming. FIRST VOICE. And you? ANOTHER VOICE. The gift of loving tears. FIRST VOICE. And you, bright Fays around him beaming? VOICES. The melody that the Silence hears! FIRST VOICE. And you, O Kelpie, with human eyes Rolling there 'neath the Waterfall? THE KELPIE. Unrest and trouble and strife like mine, And the aching heart that is under all! FIRST VOICE. And you, O Good Folk, thronging round The King and Queen of the Elfin band? VOICES. Summer gladness and summer sound, And all the pity of Fairyland! THE POET. Vision divine! How soon it passed away! While God abides, hard, cold, and unforgiving! THE ÆON. Time snows upon thee, and thy hair grows gray, And yet that Golden Boyhood still is living! Here 'mong the mountains still thy soul may see The light of Fairyland that fadeth never, And all those gifts the Elfins brought to thee Abide and live within thy soul for ever! A VOICE. ?)/????, ??????, ????? ???! Why cheat the fool and give his dreams persistence? Have we not proved that Spirits such as thou Are visions like those Elves, without existence? The man is gray,—his race is almost run.— Through Death's dark gate his feet full soon must wander; Like lights on some sad feast-day, one by one The stars have been put out in Heaven yonder. THE ÆON. What toad is this that croaks here in the shade? Out!—let us see thee,—old Abomination! VOICE. Thou pose as friend of Man? Stick to thy trade Of cheats and lying, filth and fornication. Thou knowest men are mad such dreams to cherish, Since they are beasts, and like the beasts must perish! Teach them to live their lives and eat and revel, Tell them to snatch their pleasure ere it flies,— A retrospective sentimental Devil Is but a priest or parson in disguise. THE ÆON. Brekekex! koäx, koäx!. Toads and frogs, they are croaking still! Round bald heads and slimy backs Huddle together under the hill. Ever thus since Time began They've crawled and spat on the path of Man,— Up to the heights where the moon shines clear! Leave the infernal croakers here! VOICES. If I desire to end my days at peace with all theologies, To win the pennv-a-liner's praise, the Editor's apologies, Don't think I mean to cast aside the Christian's pure beatitude, Or cease my vagrant steps to guide with Christian prayer and platitude. No, I'm a Christian out and out, and claim the kind appellative Because, however much I doubt, my doubts are simply Relative; For this is law, and this I teach, tho' some may think it vanity, That whatsoever creed men preach, 'tis Essential Christianity! In Miracles I don't believe, or in Man's Immortality— The Lord was laughing in his sleeve, save when he taught Morality; He saw that flesh is only grass, and (tho' you grieve to learn it) he Knew that the personal Soul must pass and never reach Eternity. In short, the essence of his creed was gentle nebulosity Compounded for a foolish breed who gaped at his verbosity; And this is law, and this I teach, tho' you may think it vanity, That whatsoever creed men preach, 'tis Essential Christianity! THE ÆON. They're having a little spread of their own In a ruin'd Church with a crumbling steeple— Priests and parsons, eclectic grown, Hob and nob with the scribbling people. Journalists, poets, and criticasters Join in the literary revel. Salutation, my merry masters! Don't you know me? Your friend, the Devil! VOICES. Go away, for you don't exist! God and yourself have reached finality; All now left in a World of Mist Is the creed of sensuous Morality. A VOICE. I freely tipple Omar's wine with ladies scant of drapery; I think Mahomet's Heaven fine, tho' somewhat free and capery; I feel a great respect for Joss, altho' he's none too beautiful; To fetishes, as to the Cross, I'm reverent and dutiful; I creep beneath the Buddhist's cloak, I beat the tom-tom cheerily, And smile at other Christian folk who take their creed too drearily; For this is law, and this I teach aloud to all gigmanity, That whatsoever creed men preach, 'tis Essential Christianity! To all us literary gents the future life's fantastical, And both the Christian Testaments are only ‘wrote sarcastical;’ They're beautiful, we all know well, when viewed as things poetical, But all their talk of Heaven and Hell is merely theoretical. But we are Christian men indeed, who, striking pious attitudes, Raise on a minimum of creed a maximum of platitudes! For this is law, and this we teach, with grace and with urbanity, That whatsoever creed men preach, 'tis Essential Christianity! THE ÆON. Phantoms of men, that never knew The golden Boyhead and the Fable, Leave them to feast, as dogs may do, On fragments from the Churchman's table— Trimmers and tinkers, neither false nor true, Low foreheads, sensual mouths, and minds unstable! Away, away! the peaks up yonder Grow brighter yet while we are upward soaring; Between us and the moon wild spirits wander, Their eyes on that divine white Light, adoring. THE ELVES. The bugles are blowing from height to height, Under the heavens so blue; Hark, they are ringing from height to height With a hark and a hey halloo! ECHOES. Halloo! halloo! halloo! THE POET. Where art thou, Master? THE ÆON. (far off) Here above thee! Follow on through the shadows grey, And if thy limbs are too slow to move thee, Grasp the skirt of a passing Fay! VOICES. Fast through the night, from height to height, In thy train, O Queen, we flee— There is Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton, And Mary Carmichael, and me! THE POET. In a blood-red robe that parts to show, The wondrous bosom white as snow, Around her neck a thin red line, A pale crown on her golden hair, She flitteth through the grey moonshine, For ever sweet, for ever fair. Haggard and fierce, with dripping sword, Beside her stalks her savage lord, And following her, the Maries share Her loveliness and her despair. O rose-red mouth, O sphinx-like eyes That witched the Boy and fired his blood— Still on my soul, O Mary, lies Thy spell of woeful womanhood! Deathless, a Queen thou reignest still In memory's desolate domain, And as we gaze, our pulses thrill To share thy passion and thy pain! VOICES. Fast through the night, from height to height, O Queen, we follow thee,— There is Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton, And Mary Carmichael, and me! THE POET. Fairyland of Love and Sorrow, Thickly close your shadows round me! Once again your dreams I borrow, Love hath kiss'd me, clasp'd me, crown'd me! Out of every dell and hollow Bright shapes beckon, and I follow! Forms of olden myth and fancy Witch the night with necromancy; Elf and Lover, Gnome and Lady, Kiss and clasp in woodlands shady; From the torrent Kelpies crying Hail the Fays above them flying; Hither, thither, upward streaming To the stars above them beaming, To the heights by dream-shapes haunted, Fly the Fairy Folk enchanted! VOICES. The bugle is blowing from height to height Under the heavens of blue,— We fly, we fly through the mists of night, With a hark and a hey halloo! ECHOES. Halloo! halloo! halloo! THE ÆON. On the topmost peak I stand, Come, ye Dreams and Shadows, come! At the lifting of my hand Kneel around me and be dumb! O crowd of woeful things, Gods, and Demi-gods, and Fays, Hush your hearts and fold your wings, While the Emblem I upraise! VOICES. See! see! see! THE POET. Why gaze they downward, hungering from the peaks To some dim Shape that climbeth from below? Why turn thine own eyes thither, while thy cheeks Seem wan with some new woe? VOICES. See! see! see! He cometh hither, the Jew, The Weariful One they slew 'Tween thief and thief on the Tree! With hair as white as snow He climbeth from below, His feet and hands drip blood,— Alack! He traileth on, Though old and woebegone, His heavy Cross of wood! THE JEW. How long, O God, how long! THE POET. O piteous cry, For ever heard while the swift years rush by! Vapour and mist enfold the feeble form, Beneath Him as he goes the abysses loom, Answer'd by woeful Spirits of the Storm Moaning He trails His Cross through gulfs of gloom. VOICES. Dry thy tears and raise thy head, He is quick that once was dead! THE POET. Christ of the broken Heart, and is it Thou Who standest 'mong Thy brethren there on high? Erect and silver-hair'd, Thou takest now The gentle benediction of the Sky; Tumultuous, multitudinous, as the crests Of storm-vex'd billows on a moonstruck sea, The gods flock round and smite their naked breasts, Calling aloud on Thee! And towering o'er them, ring'd with Shapes divine, Osiris, Zeus, Apollo, Vishnu, Brahm, Forms of the Phallus, Virgins of the Shrine, Thou standest starry-eyed, supreme and calm, And on Thy mirror'd head the waves of Light Creep soft and silvern from a million spheres, Sprinkling ablution from the baths of Night And shining on Thy face worn thin with tears. Saviour of men, if Thou hast spoken truth, Blesser of men, if men by pain are blest, Scorner of darkness, star of Love and ruth, Grey time-worn Phantom of the world's unrest, Now to the heights Thou comest, and before Thee All gods that men have made are kneeling low, Thy brother and sister stars in Heaven adore Thee, Lord of Eternal Woe! And yet, O Father Christ, I seek not Thee, Though to Thy spell I yearn and bend the knee; Thou hast no power my empty heart to fill, Thou hast no answer to my soul's despair, Thine eyes are holy but Thy touch is chill, Heaven still is homeless though Thou shinest there! MATER SERAPHICA. Son of my Soul! light of my eyes! Still with my blessing on thy brow, Cast off thy burthen, and arise! THE POET. Holy of Holies, is it thou? Thou livest, thou art not dead and cold! Thy touch is warm, as 'twas of old! And on thy face there shines anew The Love Divine from which I grew! O mother! all Eternity Burns to one steadfast light in thee, And all the tears of all Creation Cease, to thy glad transfiguration! SHE SPEAKS. Lean thy head on my breast! THE POET. O the bliss, O the rest! It is worth all the pain To be with thee again! SHE SPEAKS. All thy sorrows are done,— I am with thee, my son! EPODE. This is the Song the glad stars sung when first the Dream began, This is the Dream the world first knew when God created Man, This is the Voice of Man and God, blent (even as mine and thine!) Where'er the soul of the Silence wakes to the Love which is Divine! How should the Dream depart and die since the Life is but its beam? How should the Music fade away, since the Music is the Dream? How should the Heavens forget their faith, and the Earth forget its prayer, When the Heavens have plighted troth to Earth, and the Love Divine is there? The Song we sing is the Starry Song that rings for an endless Day, The endless Day is the Light that dwells on the Love that passeth away, The Love that ever passeth away is the Love (like thine and mine!) That evermore abideth on in the heart of the Love Divine! Miscellaneous Poems. TWO SONS. I I have two Sons, Wife— Two, and yet the same; One his wild way runs, Wife, Bringing us to shame. The one is bearded, sunburnt, grim, and fights across the sea, The other is a little son who sits upon your knee. II One is fierce and cold, Wife, As the wayward Deep: Him no arms could hold, Wife, Him no breast could keep. He has tried our hearts for many a year, not broken them; for he Is still the sinless little one that sits upon your knee. III One may fall in fight, Wife— Is he not our son? Pray with all your might, Wife, For the wayward one; Pray for the dark, rough soldier, who fights across the sea, Because you love the little son who smiles upon your knee. IV One across the foam, Wife, As I speak may fall; But this one at home, Wife, Cannot die at all. They both are only one; and how thankful should we be, We cannot lose the darling Son who sits upon your knee! PAT MULDOON; OR, JACK THE GIANT-KILLER UP TO DATE. ‘Boys, give the divil his due! He's a man like me and you, No wild baste!’ cried Drum-Major Pat Muldoon To the new recruits from home, sailing southward o'er the foam In the troopship, 'neath the shining tropie moon— ‘Give the blooming Boer his due; he's a man, like me or you, Tho' like me or you he's rusty when he's riled— If you scrape his rough old hide sure you'll find a heart inside That's tinder to a woman or a child! ‘D'ye mind the time long past, when we met the beggars last? (And begor’, they gave us beans on 'Juba Hill!) I'd a cousin, Jack Molly, who had join'd as drummer boy, A devil's imp—all mischief, never still! And sure that same spalpeen, though only just fifteen, And looking less than that—he was so small, Could hold his own in jaw with the bloodiest Johnnie Raw That ever hoped to dodge a cannon ball! ‘“Sure they're Giants,” Jack would say, like the ones Jack wint to slay, When he hid hisself and heard their “Fee! faw! fum!” “It's our English blood they smell, but we're going to give them Hell, And it's me that will be there to strike 'em dumb! I'm a soger! Jack's my name! like that other known to fame! And they'll find me just as sharp and wide awake!” We slapt him on the back, and cried, laughing, “Bravo, Jack! You're Jack the Giant-killer, no mistake!” ‘Well, our work was cut out soon, right up country,’ cried Muldoon, ‘And begorra, we'd our bellyfull at last, For the Boers, like Giants grim, fierce of face, and strong of limb, Came thronging all around us thick and fast! But the drum and fife still played, and we faced thim undismayed, Though many a gallant soger had to fall, And 'twas Hell and Tommie there, and no time to think or spare, And that little imp of Cain was in it all! ‘Well, not far from 'Juba Hill (where at last we got our fill, Outnumber'd, squarely beat, as you've been told), One night our camp was stormed, and the Dutchmen round us swarmed Like flocks of hungry wolves around a fold! Faith, like Giants thin indeed looked those men of mighty breed, As they popt their shaggy heads out one by one! And at every shot they sint, down a British soger wint, And at last they made a dash—and we was done! ‘Back to back we gather'd there, facing grim death and despair, While plop and ping the leaden rain did fall, And 'twas thin I chanced to spy that young imp of Cain close by, Still standing up, though wounded by a ball! His drum was riddled through, but he shrick'd and cried “Hurroo!” And waved a small six-shooter in his fist, And he emptied his last shot from the barrels smoking hot At a Giant wid a bushy beard—and missed! ‘Sure, boys, it was a sight I remember day and night, Though it lasted but a moment, as it were: That shrieking soger imp, like a little redbiled shrimp, And that Ogre wid the shaggy beard and hair! He look'd right down at Jack, waved the other Giants back, As they rush'd along that shrieking kid to slay— Then smiled (I saw him do it!), then, almost before I knew it, Tuck'd Jack beneath his arm, and walked away! ‘Thin thinks I, his time is come! and I thought of “Fee! faw! fum!” And the bloody tales I'd read before that day; Tho' we heard him squeal and call, sure we couldn't help at all, For the inemy were round us like the Say— And before that Say we ran, back to back and man to man, Till safe within our lines we breath'd once more. “Well, good-bye to Jack,” I said, for I gave him up for dead,— Yis, gobbled up and aten by the Boer! ‘Boys, some six weeks after that, as in camp our Tommies sat, The news of peace thin spreading far and wide— Up and down before our tint, smoking angry-like I wint, For I thought of little Jack, and how he'd died— And I longed to stand once more, wid my hand against the Boer, To revenge the little divil caught and slain— When I heard a loud laugh near, and a voice cried, “Pat, look 'ere! It's Jack the Giant-killer—back again!” ‘Holy Moses, it was him! There he stood, the divil's limb, In his regimintals old, but patch'd and neat— And upon his head he wore a big hat (just like a Boer!) And a pair of buckskin boots upon his feet; And pale and worn and thin, wid a kind of sheepish grin, He came among the laughing, shouting throng— “Is i: you, Jack, or your ghost? Sure we thought ye dead and lost! Where the thunder have ye hid yourself so long?” ‘Thin he told us . . . such a tale! (and his face looked queer and pale, Wid a quiet look it never had before) How he'd lain for many a day, sick and wounded, far away, A prisoner in the keepin’ of the Boer! And the men began to laugh, crying round him in their chaff, “Thin the Giants didn't ate ye, Jack, me boy!” “Garn! give the Boer his due, he's a man like me or you, Not a bloody raging baste,” said Jack Molloy. ‘Thin he told us how that night, when he vanish'd from our sight, 'Neath the armpit of that Giant wid the beard, He felt the warm blood flow down his wounded side and so He screech'd and swoon'd away—he was so skeered! When he waken'd from that swoon—and he did wake!’ said Muldoon, ‘He thought that he was gone to Kingdom Come, For 'twas darkness all around, and he couldn't hear a sound, And all the world seem'd far away and dumb! ‘But, boys, he wasn't dead! He was lying in a bed, Still and warm, in folds of linen white as snow, And around him in the gloom was a quiet, cosy room, Wid a clock a-ticking, peaceful, soft, and low; And he drew a long deep breath, thinking, “Sakes, if this is death, It's as comfy, sure, as any crib I've tried!” Thin he tried to rise, in vain, for a quick, sharp stitch of pain Ran through him, from the red wound in his side! ‘Just thin, as he lookt round, he seem'd to hear a sound Close beside him, like a soft and quiet tread— And he saw to his surprise, thro' the mist that fill'd his eyes, A shape that stood and listen'd by his bed. 'Twas a Woman, and thinks he (being fever-struck, d'ye see), “Why, it's mother!—I'm at home, though sick and weak!” And “Mother!” faint he cried, and the Woman by his side Bent above him, and a tear fell on his cheek! ‘Thin—the mist before his eyes seemed to clear away and rise, And he saw she was a stranger, strong and tall, Wid a cap on her white hair such as thim Boer women wear, And not his own poor mother after all; But the face he lookt upon, though 'twas sad and woe-begone, Was kindly, and she took his little hand, And smiling gintly now, while she stoopt and kissed his brow, Said something that he could not understand! ‘Thin while, too weak to rise, he lookt up into her eyes, He started, for he heard another tread, And he saw, and sank back skeer'd, that big Giant wid the beard Standing near him, blinking down upon the bed! And thinks he, “My time is come,” for be thought of “Fee! faw! fum!” And that Bloodybones was there at last to slay . . . But the Giant's face meanwhile wore a cur'ous kind o' smile And he nodded in a friendly sort o' way! ‘Boys, what need to tell you more? He'd been carried by the Boer To his farm among the mountains, as you've guessed, And the Giant and his wife they had nurst him back to life, And kept him like a young bird in a nest! For they'd lost an only boy, who had been their hope and joy, Jack's own age, too, and his very size and make! So when the Boer caught sight of young Jack amidst the fight, He had saved him—for the little Dutchman's sake. . . ‘O the rest, and O the calm, in that quiet upland farm, Where Jack was nurst through thim long summer hours! To watch in a half-dream, while the sleepy old mill-stream Lay sprawling its fat fingers through the flowers! Thin to sit in the sweet air, propt up in his armchair, And to see the happy light across the land, While the Mother bent her head o'er the Holy Book and read In the lingo that he didn't understand. ‘And the Giant? He'd come there, wid his shaggy beard and hair, And grunt and grin and nod at Master Jack! Or stretching out his paw, like a kindly grizzly bear, He'd laugh and pat him gintly on the back! O to feel the life increase, wid the sense of love and peace, Forgetful of the world and all its care, As Jack did! Little Jack! till they sent him smiling back! Do I know it? Don't I know it! I was there! ‘Yis, ye blooming Johnnie Raws, cease your lies and hold your jaws— It's a noble foe you'll find across the Say! Give the good old Boer his due—he's a man like me or you— Not an Ogre, or a ragin' baste of prey! Do I know it? Don't I know it! Sure I'm livin' here to show it! Say I'm lyin', and I'll make ye change your tune; For the name of that same boy wasn't Jack, nor yet Molloy, 'Twas me that's now Drum-Major Pat Muldoon!’ THE WIDOW: A WAR SONG. ‘I know that you will always do your duty to your Sovereign and country, wherever that duty may lead you, and I pray God to protect you and bring you back safely home.’—The Queen to her Soldiers. ‘Stand, Watchman, on the Castle height, And southward gaze for me, Beyond the day, across the night, And say—What dost thou see?’ ‘I see the clouds of battle lower, Our hosts flock forth to slay! . . .’ The Widow, in her Palace bower, Stood listening, old and gray. ‘Oh, Watchman, is it well with those Who 'neath my banners stand, Whose swords are drawn to smite my foes In yonder far-off Land?’ ‘Lady, their camps are red with blood, Their kinsmen's and their own . . .’ As pale as Death the Widow stood, Sad-hearted and alone. ‘Oh, Watchman, look again and hark, What dost thou hear and see?’ ‘I hear a sobbing in the dark Of widow'd souls like thee,— I hear a sound that drowns in tears The War-cry far away!’ That sound of sorrow in her ears, The Widow knelt to pray. ‘Oh, Watchman, gaze across the night And watch my hosts again, For surely troops of Angels bright Are hovering round the slain?’ ‘Angels of Death in raiment red Pass, but in wrath divine!’ The Widow moaned, ‘God help the Dead, And loving hearts like mine!’ ‘Oh, Watchman, seek the night afar For Him, our God and Lord,— Among those thunder-clouds of War Doth He not wield the sword?’ ‘Lady, indeed I see Him there, But bow'd in woe like thee!’ The Widow, moaning in despair, Pray'd still on bended knee. ‘Oh, look again! doth He not stay To crown my glorious Dead?’ ‘Lady, He rather turns away To bless the widow's bread, To dry the weeping children's eyes Throughout the stricken Lands!’ Her gaze uplifted to the skies, The Widow wrung her hands. ‘Oh, Watchman, doth He speak no word, To be our strength and guide?’ ‘Nay!—for the hand that draws the Sword Must cast the Sword aside! Thy Master is the Prince of Peace, But holds no soul in thrall,— 'Tis theirs to bid the tempest cease Who prayed that it should fall!’ ‘Oh, Watchman, mark my sons once more! Do they not pause and kneel?’ ‘Lady, thy legions trample o'er The necks beneath their heel; They cry for Him, thy Lord, to bless Their bloody loss and gain!’ She sobbed, ‘Christ, help the fatherless!’ And wrung her hands again. ‘Oh look and see, more near,’ The weeping Widow said, ‘How fare the men who loosen'd here Those storms of wrath and dread, Who swore to me that Christ our Lord Would bless the Dream and Deed?’ ‘Lady, around the laden board They feast, while thousands bleed!’ ‘My curse,’ she cried, ‘for evermore On those false Chiefs and vain Who drew by night across my door The crimson cross of Cain!’ ‘Lady, from land to land there runs The sob of broken hearts, While the brave life-blood of thy sons Is priced in yonder marts!’ The royal Widow rose her height. ‘My path is dark,’ she said, ‘I prayed the Lord to lend me Light, He sends me Death instead!’ ‘Lady, when men forsake their Lord His Light is ne'er their guide; Only the hand that draws the sword Can cast the sword aside.’ THE BURIAL OF PARNELL. (Spoken in the Person of one of his Followers.) ‘We come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.’ I We come to bury Cæsar, not To praise him!—yet our eyes Grow dim above the holy spot Where our dead Monarch lies. The hungry millions, weeping too, Mourn their lost Lord and Friend, While here we stand, the faithful few Who loved him till the end! II Cæsar lies dead!—yea, Cæsar! Tho His brows were never crown'd, He reigned, until the assassin's blow First struck him to the ground; He walk'd imperial in command, While angry factions raved— Sad Cæsar of the woeful Land Which he redeemed and saved! III Cæsar is dead!—no golden throne Or purple robes sought he, But led, in darkness and alone, Legions that would be free; His armies were the famish'd throng That rose and march'd by night, A living Host that swept along To some great Land of Light! IV The dim Light grows, the Dawn is nigh, But he who led us on, Who held the fiery Cross on high Thro' the long night, is gone! Full at his heart the cowards smote With many a trait'rous thrust, While Falsehood fasten'd on his throat And dragg'd him to the dust! . . . V Ev'n as a Lion fixing eyes On something far away, He stood alone 'neath sunless skies On his great triumph-day; Then, while he march'd, the battle-place His jackals gather'd in . . . And now? The things which fear'd his face Fight for the Lion's skin! VI What one of these shall put it on? Thou, weakest of the weak, Who, when thy Lord lay woe-begone, First kiss'd, then smote, his cheek? Or thou, who mock'd him in his fall With foul and impious jest? Or thou, the basest of them all, Who gnaw'd the bleeding breast? VII Jackals and cowards, mourn elsewhere! Not near the mighty Dead! Your breath pollutes the holy air Around a Martyr's bed. Go! fatten with the Scribes and Pricsts Who led your foul array, Or crouch, with all the timorous beasts Who follow'd him for prey! VIII Who slew this man? The cruel Foe That stabb'd our Erin first; Then Brutus, loth to strike the blow; Then Casca, the accurst; Then freedmen by his hands unbound, And slaves his hands had fed, Joining the throng that ring'd him round, Stoned him till he was dead! IX Lo, where the English Brutus stands, With white and reverend hair, Bloodstains upon the wrinkled hands He calmly folds in prayer; Facing all ways beneath the sky, Strong still, tho' worn and wan, This Brutus is (so all men cry) ‘An honourable man’! X Casca and Cassius haggard-eyed, Their gaze on Brutus' face, Say, ‘Surely Cæsar had not died If thou had given him grace!’ O thrice-bound Freeman, in whose name They proved this dead Man base, Still keep from unbelief and shame Thy Marriage Market-place! XI There, where the White Slave, Woman, stands, Wearing her gyves of gold, Soothe with the ointment of the creeds The body ere 'tis sold; Preach the high Law of Purity, Find out all stains and slurs, And keep the great Slave-market free To righteous purchasers! XII But, Brutus, thou who conjurest In Freedom's sacred name, Back from this grave, mar not this rest, Breathe not this Martyr's name! Priests on thy left hand and thy right Stand up and prate of God, While he thou didst betray and smite Lies dead beneath the sod! XIII Still, where thou standest, bending o'er Thy head, and blessing thee, Broods the pale Babylonian Whore They name ‘Morality:’ Making a noble spirit blind With her polluting breath, She found the means Hate could not find, And plann'd the deed of Death! XIV Who slew this man? Thou, Christian Land, Who sendest o'er the foam Mammon and Murther hand in hand To shame the Christ at home! The Christ? His painted I mage, nurst By knaves who cast on men The curse of Priestcraft—last and worst, The Priestcraft of the Pen! XV Not till our King lay bleeding there, Crept forth with cruel eyne The venomed things which make their lair Beneath the Seven-Hill'd Shrine: Then, in the name of him they priced, Degraded, and betrayed, They poisoned, these false priests of Christ, The wounds a Judas made! XVI We come to bury, not to praise Our Cæsar—yet his knell Joins with the cry of wrath we raise Gainst those through whom he fell! While Freemen pass from hand to hand The Fiery Cross he waved, His fame shall lighten thro' the Land Which he redeemed and saved! THE GOOD PROFESSOR'S CREED. (INSCRIBED TO PROFESSOR HUXLEY.) My creed, without circumlocution, I thus deliver clear and pat: I do believe in Evolution, In Protoplasm, and all that! I do believe in all the 'ologies, (Except The-ology, of course!) But common, cocksure, useful knowledge is The compass which directs my course. I don't believe in God or Gammon, In powers above or priests below, But I've some slight respect for Mammon As representing status quo; I hate all efforts revolutionary, All systems that subvert the State, For Law is slow and evolutionary, And those low down have got to—wait. Unless (that fact I should have stated!)— Unless they're led by Lights like me; For Evolution, though 'tis fated, By gentle Force may further'd be; In fact, I hold like my existence, Since nothing in the world is free, That Force to which there's no resistance Is always justified, per se! I turn from all insipid dishes Cook'd by the fools of Laissez faire, And much prefer the loaves and fishes, So long as I can get my share; I think the Land is not the Nation's, But those who grab'd it in the past; Statutes, therefore, of limitations, Should make all thieves secure, at last! I don't believe men free and equal (I think so? Feel my bumps, and tell!) Of all such fads the sorry sequel Is anarchy and social Hell; I do believe in ‘facts’ prodigiously, Class, label, place them on the shelf, I do believe (almost religiously!) In that most precious Fact, Myself! I'm many-sided, many-coloured, Socialist, Individualist; I do believe that man a dullard Who seeks philanthropies of mist: I hold that General Booth's tyrannical, And all his scheme of social aid Is just Religion turn'd mechanical— A Barrel-organ badly played! I think that Liberty's a swindle! We look upon it with a smile— I and my dear Professor Tyndall, The Peter Parleys of Carlyle! He knew the ‘nigger’ was a ‘servant’ By law of God, or (what's the same) By laws proclaimed by prophets fervent Of Nature's Tory end and aim! I turn from every sect and schism, God and all gods I leave behind, I sneer at even Positivism, Because it deifies Mankind: Such creeds are either false or flighty, Since men are flesh and flesh is grass . . . And yet . . . one knowing God Almighty Regards me—from the looking-glass! I do believe that Superstition, And what they call ‘the larger Hope,’ Have fled before the new condition Of self-reliance and of soap: Free from the falsehoods of Divinity, Breaking the bonds by preachers spun, I leave the old creed of the Trinity For the new creed of Number One! Moral and physical diseases May be effaced in course of time, But, left to do whate'er he pleases, Man leaps from folly into crime: We've got to wash and comb and teach him, Learn him the laws of self-control, Wean him from doctrinaires who teach him Rubbish about that gas, his soul! Be clean, be calm, be thrifty! These are My chief injunctions to the Poor, Give Cæsar what belongs to Cæsar, Don't even begrudge a little more! Be very careful in your reading, Avoid imaginative stuff; Study the rules of cattle-breeding, And when you pair, cry ‘quantum suff.’ To advance the human race I'm willing, So long as it is shrewdly done, But never will I give one shilling To any ‘fad’ beneath the sun; While the worst fad of all is ‘Piety,’ With all its cant of Heaven o'erhead, Philanthropy's a bad variety Of that same fad, when all is said! And so I sit with calm pulsations, Watching the troubled human fry, Examining their agitations With careful microscopic eye! I, Thomas, Omnium Scrutator, Finding most creatures mean or base, Despite your Hominum Salvator! Man's duty is—to keep his place! A DEDICATION. I. To An Old Enemy. I would have snatch'd a bay leaf from thy brow, Wronging the chaplet on an honoured head; In peace and tenderness I bring thee now A lily-flower instead. Pure as thy purpose, blameless as thy song, Sweet as thy spirit may this offering be! Forget the bitter blame that did thee wrong, And take the gift from me! October 1881. II. To Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Calmly, thy royal robe of Death around thee, Thou sleepest, and weeping Brethren round thee stand; Gently they placed, ere yet God's angel crown'd thee, My lily in thy hand! I never knew thee living, O my brother! But on thy breast my lily of love now lies; And by that token we shall know each other, When God's voice saith ‘Arise!’ August 1882. COLONEL SHARK. I was raised in the land where the sun don't set, And the men ain't crook-neck squashes; I can see as fur as most I've met, And know what almighty bosh is. I guess I rile when I see a snake, And I jedge a dog by his bark, I'm putty consid'rable wide-awake; So I do admire at my own mistake In the matter of Cunnle Shark. The Cunnle he was the pride of the place, And his ways were most amazin'; The hair was singed from his cheeks and face With etarnal powder blazin’; His skin was covered with red tattoo Like a tree with a streaked-up bark; He'd been ripp'd and riddled till all was blue,— You'd star' a spell if you heard a few Of the ways of Cunnle Shark. One eye was glass, and the other real, His cheeks were scarred and bony, A bullet had blown away his heel, So he limped on an iron pony; For hands he'd only a thumb on his right, And nothin' else to remark; With his left, I guess, he used to fight, And to see his style was a pleasant sight, For a cur'ous man was Shark. The Cunnle he had a hickory stick, All notches you couldn't number, For he took his knife and he made a nick When he sent a man to slumber; He notched it neat as an almanack, Or a ledger kept by a clerk; 'Twas ‘Blood and thunder! stick slick! crick! crack!’ And he wiped his tools, and he turned his back To nick the slain, did Shark. His style in the street was a sight to see, And the way'd be cleared politely, And he'd chaw and swagger and spit so free, With his glass eye glaring brightly. At the bar he'd stand and the paper read, As ready to bite as bark, And the folk would whisper, they would indeed, ‘Ah, there's a man who's no pumkin seed!’ The pride o' the place was Shark. What hed he done? Why, he'd fought and bled, And was ready late and early; He shot his own brother as dead as lead, On a p'int of honour, fairly. He'd never flinch and he paid his way, And he never drew in the dark; He'd been known to sarse six men in a day,— And sure as ever there rose a fray, Why, in went Cunnle Shark. Though the bullets were thick as hail somehow He'd keep as fresh as a tulip, Then out he'd come and wipe his brow, And call for a sherry-julep. His life by a sort of charm was kept, And the smartest missed their mark; So when on the shady side he stept, To the other side creation crept, At the sight o' Cunnle Shark. The Cunnle drank with his friends down here, And let 'em pay for the liquor; But his way with strangers was rayther queer, Sharper, I guess, and quicker. When a stranger entered he'd rile a few, And his brow would wrinkle dark: ‘Stranger,’ he'd say, ‘I'll liquor with you!’ And if the poor cuss said, ‘I'm dern'd if you do,’ Why, in went Cunnle Shark. There was a man!—Jest the sort o' grit You don't raise out of Ameriky, Honest and ready, lickety-split, For white man, nigger, or Cherokee; And useful in bringin' of Cain to book When thieves were beginnin' to lark; And the Sheriff of Grizzly, R. S. Rooke, Was the only party that dared to look In the eye of Cunnle Shark. Whenever the Sheriff had work on hand, And a dern'd deep case to tunnel, He'd load his persuaders and dress up grand, And send up town for the Cunnle; Then off they'd slip, and the thieves pursue, And hunt 'em light and dark, And livin' or dead they'd nail the crew; And drunk for a week they'd be, them two, The Sheriff and Cunnle Shark. Now when two men are particklar great, Of the same proud flesh and feather, The same free airth, by a kind o' fate, Won't hold them both together. And it came about that these two fine cocks, All flitter, flutter, and squark, Began to fret in the same old box; And each grew sarsier in his socks, The Sheriff and Cunnle Shark. Friends they had been, and wal content! But the best o' weather grows windy, And they saw the chaps wherever they went Lookt out by rights for the shindy; To funk because they were bosom friends, Would be to miss the mark, And so, for to serve the public ends, To Cheriss's Store each party wends, The Sheriff and Cunnle Shark. Wal, how it riz, and which side began, I know no more 'n a nigger, But the Cunnle he clean ript up his man Before he could touch a trigger; And R. S. Rooke, for a partin' spell, Made this yer dyin' remark, ‘Cunnle, yur hand!’ (then he flopped and fell): ‘Of all the game critters that's out o' hell. The gamest is Cunnle Shark!’ So Cunnle Shark was left alone For our particklar glory, And he stalk'd about, and the place was his own, And was praised in song and story: And when the Sheriff had run his race, And been snuff'd like any spark, It soon was settled in all the place That the Sheriff's post, as an act of grace, Should go to Cunnle Shark. So we wash'd our faces and fixed our clothes, And got up a deputation, And down to the end of the town we goes For the Sheriff's consecration; And cockin' under his Kansas hat His old glass eye to mark, With his legs in the air, as lean as a rat, Squirting the juice around him, sat The pride o' the people, Shark. ‘Cunnle!’ says I; and ‘Sir!’ he says, And ‘Cunnle!’ again I utter'd, ‘You are the pride of the human race, And your bread ain't yet half butter'd! Hon'rable, chipper, bold, and free, A man for the world to mark— Grit of the earth and salt of the sea;’ And there I stopt, and the Cunnle he Says, ‘My name is Cunnle Shark!’ ‘Ongcore!’ cries one, and the Cunnle set His eye in the chap's direction. ‘I was born in the sunny South, I bet! And to sarse I've some objection; My words is few, and my deeds is known— I never kept 'em dark. You want me to be your Sheriff? Done!’ And he rose and stretch'd his limbs in the sun; ‘Let's liquor!’ says Cunnle Shark. That very moment we hear a cry, And in rush'd Abner Yoker (Though Abner's small, he's fierce and spry, And as hard as any poker). His cheeks were hollow and all aghast, And he spoke with a gulp and a jark; ‘Stop! stop!’ he shrieks, all fierce and fast: ‘I've found who stole my hosses at last— Thet cuss of the airth, E. Shark!’ We stared and shiver'd, and gasped for breath, And each was a panting funnel, For we thought that Abner was in for death, To talk so fierce to the Cunnle; But the Cunnle he was pale a few, And he seem'd all staring stark ‘He stole my hosses, and sold 'em too!’ Pale and shivering through and through, ‘It's a Lie!’ gasped Cunnle Shark. He skew'd one eye, and he twitched his mouth, And the glass eye glared and glisten'd; ‘O yes! I was riz in the sunny South, And Ephraim Shark I was christen'd!’ ‘What's this? The Cunnle a thief!’ we cried— ‘Thet man—of honour the spark! Couldn't be true! What—creation's pride!’ ‘Wal, here's my witnesses at my side,’ Cried Abner; ‘I charges Shark!’ Then before the Cunnle could draw or speak, The little one sprang and tript him; While we admired at his thunderin' cheek, Slick hand and foot he clipt him: And he drew his teeth (one big bowie, And pistols) with no remark— Then tied him fast with a grin o' glee! ‘I call for a Court to sit,’ says he, ‘In the case of Cunnle Shark!’ It's orful how guilt unnerves a cuss— The Cunnle was clean dumfounded; And now no longer he'd charms for us, Though his dern'd old teeth he grounded, But I confess I was full o' grief To see a man o' mark, Respected, happy, of all the chief, Turn out that scum of the airth, a thief, And I wept for Cunnle Shark. For a moral place was Grizzly Creek, No spot to pilfer and pick in. If a thief was caught, 'twas slickity squeak, And up he was sent a-kickin’. The preciousest thing in the Creek was a Hoss, As dear as the dove to the Ark! But a man or two was no grit loss, And life, you guess, was a pitch and a toss To more than Cunnle Shark. We form'd a court on the spot jest there, With his geese around us sissin’, Jedge and jury, and all things square, And a Testament for kissin’. The bob'link cried from the laylock spray And answer'd the meadow-lark; The corn was yellow upon thet day, And the mornin' glories lookt bright and gay Round the hut o' Cunnle Shark. Natur' is natur'! When Shark was bound, And beyond more ruination, No end o' witnesses were found Who'd been part of the deputation! And they said they'd allays long'd to speak Of his doin's in the dark, Only—they'd never found the cheek T' accuse such a pop'lar man in the Creek As the fightin' Cunnle Shark. ‘Guilty!’—Guilty, and no mistake, For the proofs were black as thunder. I saw the Cunnle tremble and shake, And his knees a-knocking under. With a voice that shook, for the Cunnle he Had been sech a man o' mark, I spoke his sentence, and it should be ‘To be swung by the neck to the nearest tree!’ ‘Euchred!’ shrieked Cunnle Shark. ‘Pris'ner,’ says I, ‘it unnerves a man To hev this ugly duty, And to think how promisin' you began— A character full of beauty. In the ways of virtue you shot ahead, War' honour'd both light and dark; And you've come to this! To be jedged,’ I said, ‘To be hung by the neck till you air dead.’ ‘O Lord!’ cried Cunnle Shark. Yes, he stared at fust like a skeery child, And all his game departed. I could have kick'd him—I felt so riled To find him chicken-hearted. But, you see, to be stript of his hard-eern'd fame And life at one big jark, To find his glory all brought to shame, And to go from life with so bad a name, Was dern'd hard lines on Shark. But when he saw his last kerd was play'd, The Cunnle show'd his mettle. ‘Wal, boys,’ says he, ‘it's a mess I've made, And this durn'd old neck must settle. Let this yer teach ye to mind the law, And play no tricks in the dark. Abner Yoker, jest shake my paw! Neow, feel in my pants, and give me a chaw!’ Was the last words spoke by Shark. He could see the men in the corn-patch nigh, And could hear the lark a-singin’, As we carried him to the wood jest by, Where the hang-birds cried a-swingin’; For Abner Yoker he found a cord On the hitchin'-post in the park: We gave him one minute to pray to the Lord, And with glass eye glaring and cheeks scarscored, Swish! up ran Cunnle Shark! I was raised in the land where the sun don't set, And the men ain't crook-neck squashes! I can see as fur as most I've met, And know what almighty bosh is; But I never have seen a career to break So bright, and to end so dark; I'm putty consid'rable wide-awake, So I do admire at my own mistake In the matter of Cunnle Shark. THE FISHER BOY: A SONG IN TIME OF WAR. [On Saturday, October 28, 1890, the fishing-boat ‘Truelight,’ of Gordon, Kincardineshire, manned by a fisherman named Taylor and his four sons, foundered and sank. The old man saw three of his sons swept away, but managed to get hold of an oar; and by and by his second son, Alexander, appeared swimming by his side. Seeing that the oar would be unlikely to support more than one, the lad calmly said to his father, ‘Weel, father, it's time I was awa',’ and sank beneath the waves.] Perchance 'tis well that lips should tell The fallen Warrior's praise: Life against life he staked, and fell,— He loses, and he pays; We hail him brave, and to his grave We bring the meed of Fame, But 'neath the sun some deeds are done That put his pride to shame! Turn from the scene where dark and dread The Storms of Battle grow, Follow the Christ whose feet still tread The Sea, as long ago;— He leaves afar the strife of War And o'er the waves walks He,— Yea, through the night He bears a Light For loving eyes to see! There's Storm, too, here!—with shrieks of strife The angry Ocean runs: In their frail boat strive hard for life A father and four sons; An old Scots Fisher of the Deep, Four lads, his flesh and blood,— Around them fierce and angry leap The waves of that fierce flood! A blast,—a crash,—the little boat Hath sunk,—but look once more! The old man on the flood doth float, Clinging to one frail oar; Three of his sons have sunk and died, Their death-cry fills his ears,— When, struggling by his father's side, The fourth, and last, appears! God help them! to their piteous cries Deaf is the angry Deep, Still darker grow the stormy skies, Higher the white waves leap!— The wild winds roar,—too frail the oar That weight of two to bear,— Then crieth one, the Fisher's son, 'Mid the black storm out there,— ‘The oar's too weak to carry twa,— And one must surely dee,— Faither, 'tis time I was awa', For God can best spare me!’ His hands just touch but do not clutch The floating oar,—and then ‘Farewell!’ he saith, and down to Death Sinks, ne'er to rise again! On the wild waves the gray old wight Now floateth safely on,— He is saved from Death this woeful night Though his brave son hath gone! . . . O surely He who on the sea Walks yet, looks down in joy Flashing His light this woeful night To bless that Fisher Boy! Doubtless 'tis well that lips should tell The fallen Warrior's praise. Life against life he staked, and fell,— He loses, and he pays! We hail him brave, and to his grave We bring the meed of Fame,— But 'neath the sun some deeds are done That put his pride to shame! THE DUMB BAIRN. My tale is brief yet strange (the Elder said); Altho' the days of miracles are fled, Hear it and mark, all ye who smile at prayer! John Sutherland, a minister of Ayr, Stern and unbending, yet a man of worth, Had one weak child, who, deaf and dumb from birth, Had never spoke a word or heard a sound. The mother, with her wild arms folded round The breathing babe, and eyes upraised to see Her husband's face set hard in agony, Had blest them both, the father and the child, And sank to slumber, even as she smiled That last farewell and tryst to meet again Beyond earth's clouds of cruelty and pain. Thus was the weary widower left alone To keep sad watch o'er his afflicted son, A tiny tender waif of feeble breath, Wordless and still, a thing of life-in-death. Now God, who to this little child forbad The pretty speech that makes a parent glad Who shut the tender doorways of his head, Closing his soul in silence deep and dread, Had made him very beautiful and bright, With golden hair and eyes of heavenly light, As sweet and bright a bairn in sooth was he As ever crowed upon a father's knee! And lo! the father loved him with a love Passing the love of women and above All dreams of men more lonely and more blest, Fondly he reared him, sleeping and at rest, And ever as he grew more strong and fair Watching him with a haggard eye of care. And so, though in that lonely house was heard No baby prattling and no half-lisp'd word To show the little spirit was astir, The child became a silent messenger Of love and blessing to the afflicted man; And after, when the little one began To move upon its feet, and when it knew The joy of life as happier children do, The minister thanked God that it was sent To be his loving comfort and content. But ever in his hour of happiness One thought to this good man brought dire distress, Exceeding pity, and a nameless fear, 'Twas that the little one could never hear The living voice of prayer,—nor understand The Book of blessing writ by God's own hand. How, then, since our salvat on we must reach Only by what the holy gospels teach (Nay, smile not, for his faith was absolute!), Could that afflicted stem bear heavenly fruit? How, never having even heard Christ's name, And how to atone for Adam's fall He came, Could this poor child be saved? In secret fear He watched the child grow on from year to year, Till it was four years old; and then at length, Having in secret prayed with all his strength, He said, ‘The bairn shall not forsaken be Through any lack of fitting faith in me, But daily in his presence I will read A chapter of the Holy Book, and plead That God, who works all wonders, may convey The message to his soul in some strange way I comprehend not.’ Ever after that Each day with book in hand the father sat, Reading a portion of the Holy Word To his beloved, who neither spoke nor heard, But ever with a silent sweet distress, Shut in his little cloud of silentness, Seem'd trying prettily to understand; And sometimes he would stretch his tiny hand And lay it softly on the leaves, meanwhile Uplooking with a bright and heavenly smile. And presently this time to read and pray Became so loved a duty of the day Ev'n to the child, that oft the little one, Eager to see the silent service done, Would run and lift the great book merrily, And setting it upon his father's knee, Look up, and wait, with sweet expectant gaze. And ever after, on the Sabbath days When in the church the father preached and taught, Thither the little silent one was brought, And while the deep hymn rose, or from above The good man preached of God's great strength and love (Nay, very often, if the truth be told, Of God's avenging judgments manifold— For the man's creed was gloomy enough and sad), Below him, looking round with glances glad Out of his cloud of silence, the pale boy Beheld the service with mysterious joy, Smiled, while the light on painted windows played, Watch'd while the black-robed preacher preached and prayed, Saw the folk rise and fall like waves of the sea, Standing erect or kneeling on the knee, And mimick'd dumbly what he saw them do, Knelt when they knelt, and seemed to hearken too! Ah, oftentimes the preacher from his place Looking with blinding tears upon his face, Seeing his darling listening as it were, Quickened his cry of agony and despair, And as he blest his congregation, blest The little silent form o'er all the rest! Thus over father and child the seasons rollèd Until the little one was seven years old, When suddenly, with some obscure disease That wastes the tender blood by slow degrees, The boy fell sick, and feebly, without pain, The rosy light of life began to wane. Doctors were called; they came with solemn tread And coldly went. ‘He was not strong,’ they said. ‘Nay, 'twas a miracle that one so frail Had lived so long and scarcely seemed to ail, But now the end of all was surely nigh, And in a little while the child must die.’ The father heard, and darkening in despair Wrestled with God in agonies of prayer, Then with the strength of loving faith moaned low, ‘My God knows best, maybe 'tis better so, And in the air of heaven more sweet and clear My bairn at last shall find a tongue, and hear A music more divine than ours below!’ Thenceforward, grim as death, his hair like snow, His body bent, with heavy hanging head, He sat for hours beside the child and read Out of the Holy Book! As the days passed His hope grew stronger and less overcast, And with a stronger voice of faith he poured His soul forth, that his boy might know the Lord. But ever when the seventh day came, alas! Wearily to the pulpit would he pass, And as he preached the news of heavenly grace Look down and miss the upturn'd and smiling face, The little kneeling form that once knelt there, The tiny hands clasp'd tight in mimic prayer, And oft his strong soul shook, his head was bowed, And in the people's sight he sobbed aloud! At last one quiet Sabbath eventide, When home he hastened to the bairn's bedside, He found him lying very wan and white, His face illumed by the red sunset light That crept across the pane, and on the bed Like roses bright was luminously shed. His eyes were closed, and on his face there fell The shadow of some peace ineffable, And very softly, thinking that he slept, The father by the bedside knelt, and wept. But suddenly the piteous eyes of azure Were opened with a heavenly look of pleasure, The little arms up-reach'd, the pale face yearned, The soft mouth pouting for a kiss upturned, And while the strong man in his anguish shook, The sick bairn smiled, and pointing to the Book, Which lay by open, made a sign he knew That he should read as he was wont to do. He took the Book, and on it fixed his eyes, And choking down the tears that still would rise, Read in a broken voice that chapter blest Which tells of ‘Quiet Waters,’ peace and rest, Where all the weary shall have comforting. Now, mark what followed:—I but tell this thing, As it was told to me, by one who heard The very man relate it word by word. Even as he sat and read, and seem'd to hear Those heavenly waters softly murmuring near, There came a cry, and startled at the sound He raised his eyes and saw with glory crowned The child's seraphic face! and lo! he heard, With all his being mystically stirred, The dumb lips speak! Yea, on his ears there fell A faint last cry of rapture and farewell; The bairn stretched out his little arms and cried, ‘Yes, papa!—quiet waters!’—smiled, and died! . . . O faith divine of days ere faith was fled! Light of a creed once quick that now is dead! Was it reality or but a dream? Did the voice call indeed, or only seem? Who knows? and who can tell which most doth prove,— A miracle of fact or one of Love? Yet this is sure—could such deep faith have seat Again in some few hearts of all that beat, Mammon and Antichrist would cease to reign, Doubts die, and miracles be wrought again! PROEM TO ‘THE SHADOW OF THE SWORD.’ Nineteen sad sleepless centuries Had shed upon the dead Christ's eyes Dark blood and dew, and o'er them still The waxen lids were sealèd chill. Drearily through the dreary years The world had waited on in tears, With heart clay-cold and eyelids wet, But He had not arisen yet. Nay, Christ was cold; and, colder still, The lovely Shapes He came to kill Slept by His side. Ah, sight of dread! Dead Christ, and all the sweet gods dead! He had not risen, tho' all the world Was waiting; tho', with thin lips curl'd, Pale Antichrist upon his prison Gazed yet denying, He had not risen; Tho' every hope was slain save Him, Tho' all the eyes of Heaven were dim, Despite the promise and the pain, He slept—and had not risen again. Meantime, from France's funeral pyre, Rose, god-like, girt around with fire, Napoleon! —On eyes and lips Burnt the red hues of Love's eclipse; Beneath his strong triumphal tread All days the human winepress bled! And in the silence of the nights Pale Prophets stood upon the heights, And, gazing thro' the blood-red gloom Far eastward, to the dead Christ's tomb, Wail'd to the winds. Yet Christ still slept:— And o'er His white Tomb slowly crept The fiery Shadow of a Sword! Not Peace; a Sword. And men adored Not Christ, nor Antichrist, but Cain; And where the bright blood ran like rain He stood, and looking, men went wild:— For lo! on whomsoe'er he smiled Came an idolatry accurst, But chief, Cain's hunger and Cain's thirst For bloodshed and for tears; and when He beckon'd, countless swarms of men Flew thick as locusts to destroy Hope's happy harvests, sown in joy; Yea, verily; at each finger-wave They swarm'd—and shared the crimson grave Beneath his Throne. Then, 'neath the sun One man of France—and he, indeed, Lowest and least of all man's seed— Shrank back, and stirr'd not!—heard Cain's cry, But flew not!—mark'd across the sky The Shadow of the Sword, but still Despair'd not!—Nay, with steadfast will, He sought Christ's Tomb, and lying low, With cold limbs cushion'd on the snow, He waited!—But when Cain's eye found His hiding-place on holy ground, And Cain's hand gript him by the hair, Seeking to drag him forth from there, He clutch'd the stones with all his strength, Struggled in silence—and at length, In the dire horror of his need, Shrieked out on Christ! Did Christ rise? Read! PROEM TO ‘GOD AND THE MAN.’ ‘All men, each one, beneath the sun, I hate, shall hate, till life is done, But of all men one, till my race is run, And all the rest for the sake of one! ‘If God stood there, revealed full bare, I would laugh to scorn His love or care,— Nay, in despair, I would pray a prayer Which He needs must grant—if a God He were! ‘And the prayer would be, “Yield up to me This man alone of all men that see! Give him to me, and to misery! Give me this man, if a God Thou be!”’ Shape on the headland in the night, Gaunt, ghastly, kneeling on his knee He prays; his baffled prayers take flight, Like screaming sea-birds, thro' the light That streams across the sleeping sea. From the black depths of man's despair Rose ever so accurst a prayer? His hands clench and his eyeballs roll, Hate's famine sickens in his soul. Meantime the windless waves intone Their peaceful answer to his moan, The soft clouds one another chase, The moon-rays flash upon his face, The mighty deep is calm; but see! This man is as a storm-swept tree. And, silvern-sandall'd, still as death, The white moon in her own pure breath Walks yonder. Doth he see her pass Over the glimmering water-glass? Sees he the stars that softly swing Like lamps around her wandering, Sown thick as early snowdrops now In the dark furrows of the Plough? Hears he the sad, still, rhythmic throb Of the dark ocean where he stands,— The great strong voice still'd to a sob, Near darken'd capes and glimmering sands? Nay, nay; but, even as a wight Who on a mirror fixeth sight, And screams at his own face of dread Within the dimness picturèd, He useth God's great sleeping sea To image hate and agony. He kneels, he prays,—nay, call it not A prayer that riseth in his throat; 'Tis but a curse this mortal cries, Like one who curses God and dies. ‘Yield up to me, to hate and me, One man alone of all men that see! Give him to me, and to misery! Give me this man if a God Thou be! ‘But the cruel heavens all open lie, No God doth reign o'er the sea or sky; The earth is dark and the clouds go by But there is no God, to hear me cry! ‘There is no God, none, to abolish one Of the foul things thought and dreamed and done! Wherefore I hate, till my race is run, All living men beneath the sun!’ To-night he rose when all was still, Left like a thief his darkened door, And down the dale and o'er the hill He flew till here upon the shore Shivering he came; and here he trod Hour after hour the glooms of God, Nursing his hate in fierce unrest, Like an elfin babe upon the breast! And all his hunger and his thirst Was vengeance on the man he cursed! ‘O Lord my God, if a God there be, Give up the man I hate to me! On his living heart let my vengeance feed, And I shall know Thou art God indeed!’ Again rings out that bitter cry Between the dark seas and the sky— Then all is hushed, while quivering, With teeth and claws, prepared to spring, He crouches beast-like . . . Hark, O hark What solemn murmur fills the dark? What shadows come and go up there, Through the azure voids of the starry air? The night is still; the waters sleep; the skies Gaze down with bright innumerable eyes: A voice comes out of heaven and o'er the sea: ‘I am; and I will give this man to thee!’ PROEM TO ‘THE NEW ABELARD.’ Shipwreck . . . What succour?— On the gnawing rocks The ship grinds to and fro with thundershocks, And thro' her riven sides with ceaseless rush The foam-fleck'd waters gush: Above, the soot-black sky; around, the roar Of surges smiting on some unseen shore; Beneath, the burial-place of rolling waves— Flowerless, for ever shifting, wind-dug graves! A moment on the riven deck he stands, Praying to Heaven with wild uplifted hands, Then sees across the liquid wall afar A glimmer like a star; The lighthouse gleam! Upon the headland black The beacon burns and fronts the stormy wrack— Sole speck of light on gulfs of darkness, where Thunder the sullen breakers of despair . . . The ship is gone . . . Now in that gulf of death He swims and struggles on with failing breath: He grasps a plank—it sinks—too frail to upbear His leaden load of care; Another and another—straws!—they are gone! He crles aloud, stifles, and struggles on; For still thro' voids of gloom his straining sight Sees the sad glimmer of a steadfast light! He gains the rocks . . . What shining hands are these Reached out to pluck him from the cruel seas? What shape is this, that clad in raiment blest Now draws him to its breast? . . . Ah, Blessèd One, still keeping, day and night, The lamp well trimmed, the heavenly beacon bright, He knows Thee now!—he feels the sheltering gleam— And lo! the night of storm dissolves in dream! PROEM TO ‘THE MOMENT AFTER.’ By kind permission of Mr. Wm. Heinemann. I. Between the Dead and the living the veil of the glamour lies, But softly it melts asunder, just as the Spirit flies. Wait by the bed of the Dying, wait till the last sharp breath, Then sit in the silence watching the eyes that are closed in Death. Thinkest thou all is o'er, now thy heart stands still for fear? Nay, something stirs in the silence!—listen, and thou mayst hear! Thou art closed around by the glamour, its darkness covers thy head,— But something walks in the chamber, and looks in the face of the Dead! Wait for a little season—be patient yet for a day— Before the breath of thy going, the veil shall dissolve away; Thou too shalt stir in the darkness, no man dreaming thee nigh, And look on thy worn white raiment, before they put it by! II. Hast thou counted the stars? hast thou measured the mastodon's bed in the stone? Rejoice, thou art wise who wast foolish! the days of thy dreaming are done! Hast thou taken the Cross from thy spirit, and lifted the veil from thine eyes! Hast thou emptied the heavens of their god-head?—Rejoice, for, O Fool, thou art wise! And now that thou knowest the heavens and the Earth, the Beginning and End, I will tell thee the last great Secret. . . Lie down on thy bed and attend! Thou lookest, but dost not listen—thou seest but dost not rejoice— Thou pickest the coverlit moaning, and shuttest thine ears to my voice. I bend to thine car and whisper—thou turnest away with a tear. . . 'Tis but a childish Secret, yet all thou hast yet to hear! Gather thy senses a moment and listen, low on thy bed. . . Now, Hearken!—Alas, thou hast fallen asleep, ere the Secret is said! L'ENVOI. I END AS I BEGAN. I end as I began, I think as first I thought; Woe worth the world, if Man Only of dust is wrought, Only to dust must go After his life's brief span;— I think so still, and so I end as I began. When first I learnt to know The common strife of all, My boy's heart shared the woe Of those who fail and fall, For all the weak and poor My tears of pity ran,— And still they flow, ev'n more Than when my life began! I reverenced from the first The Woman-Soul divine (Mother, that faith was nurst On that brave breast of thine!) Pointing the heavenward way, The angel-guide of man, She seems to me to-day As when my faith began! Revolter, sword in hand, Friend of the weak and worn, A boy, I took my stand Among the Knights forlorn; Eager against the Strong To lead the martyr'd van. I strive 'gainst Lust and Wrong As when the fight began! Never to bow and kneel To any brazen Lic,— To love the worst, to feel The least is ev'n as I,— To hold all fame unblest That helps no struggling man,— In this, as in the rest, I end as I began! The creeds I've cast away Like husks of garner'd grain, And of them all this day Does never a creed remain; Save this, blind faith that God Evolves thro' martyr'd Man; Thus, the long journey trod, I end as I began! I dreamed when I began I was not born to die, And in my dreams I ran From shining sky to sky;— And still, now life grows cold And I am grey and wan, That infant's Dream I hold, And end as I began! THE LAST CRY. Forget me not, but come, O King, And find me softly slumbering In dark and troubled dreams of Thee, Then, with one waft of Thy bright wing, Awaken me!</field>
