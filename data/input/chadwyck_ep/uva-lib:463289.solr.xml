Ezech. 37 The Prophet by the Spirite loe, is to a valley brought: Where bones he seeth, both too and fro, drie and consumde to nought. He vieweth them well and in his muse a ratling sound he heares, Not much vnlike as when they vse to iust and runne with speares. The partes, which were before alone and bones are ioynde together: They flesh and breath receiue eche one, which earst were seene to wither. We learne that though our bones doe lye turned to dust in graue, Yet when God doeth to iudgement hye we shall againe them haue. Your husband shall arise from dust though rest in graue a while he must, This fatall bed do you not feare, when death (good Ladie) draweth neere. The dryed bones inspired with winde, naked of late now flesh do finde. So you shall see euen with your eyes your husband clothed when you arise. Here Christ doeth bid you comfort seeke, thus wipe the teares from daughters cheeke, Me thinkes I see him from aboue looke downe, and thus speake to his loue: Why woman enuyest thou my state, and wouldst by teares fetch downe thy mate, And so againe renewe my care, I wish that thou, as I, mightest fare.

Abeamus &amp; nos moriamus cum illo. Sith he full lowe doeth lye, let vs with him goe dye. A Dialogue betweene the Church and Common wealth vpon the late departure of that right worthy and honourable Counseller Sir Frauncis Walsingham, who in his life had excellently deserued of them both. Ezech.4. / 1.Reg.4.31. / 2.Sam.17.16 / Hebr.13.1. / 1.Sam.15.28. / Nehe.2.12. / Iosu.14.12. / Gen.44.1. / Psal.72.6. / Num.11.11,12. / Prov.25.23. Countrey. My sister why beest thou so sad, with mourning weede in blacke thus clad? Church. The same cause we haue both to mourne, mine eyes drop teares, thy garments torne. Count. Then let vs both in mourning striue, our friend is gone and yet aliue: Church. Aliue to God, yet sorrowe make, as bankes and mountaines we may shake. Count. Nay, that the heauens may giue a sound, my mournfull voyce shall moue the ground. Church. From fountaine mine the teares that fall. with water shall fill euery dale. Count. Yet mourne I more as widowe left, as childe of parent deere bereft. Church. As mother I whose sonne is gone, or fatherlesse childe so left alone. Count. Ah wo is me, to death he's thrall, who husband, keeper was, and all. Church. Whome I begot, was my reliefe, for childe and parent double griefe. Count. From perils great he kept vs sure, by studie and cost did health procure. Church. The Papistes he from vs did chase, his bounteous hand helpt students case. Count. Iust warre he mooued, yet peace first sought, the campe in fielde, at home he fought. Church. The learned sort he did perswade, their foes by writing to invade. Count. In iudgement iust, in suites at hand, in counsaile graue, by poore did stand. Church. Religion sound, from forraine coast to straungers he a noble hoast. Count. A Cato sage, a Solon in minde, Mæcenas he, of Regulus kinde. Church. A Mardoche to Prince, in trust as Haman, Chusai, as Loth the iust. Count. A Scypio, in suites of Ciceroes skill, of Fabrice life, Vlysses travill, Church. Of Dauids minde, of Nehemies charge, like Caleb, as Ioseph in heart large. Count. To th' weary sleepe, in slight a seate, in sea a hauen, a shadowe in heate. Church. As pleasant raine, of nurses grace, as winde the cloudes, he euil did chace. Count. So may his bones now take their rest. as he in life the poore refresht. Church. Of heauenly meate he nowe doeth feede, whose counsaile was of late our meede. Count. VVhat shall I doe? no teares suffice, were he aliue, or die we likewise. Church. And how should Church her griefe descry. but stay: he's placed in starrie sky. Count. A tombe of marble shall we cast? then marble longer fame shall last. Church. In writing we his name will keepe, in heauens with diamonde grauen full deepe. Count. His title shall be faithfull friend, a father, Countrey to defend. Church. As one of vs, yet we him call a pillar, so was he to all. Count. My Epitaphe I will set downe, His body's dead, still liues renowme. Church. Mine shalbe this, thryse he is blest, whose workes doe followe in Christ at rest. The Conclusion. Y'haue wept ynough, ye seeme to me, both ouercome, or neither to be. I can not say who hath lost more, The dolefull Church, or cuntrey poore, But cease your teares and now reioyce, Of heauenly myrth he hath made choice. Epitaphium seu tumuli inscriptio. The Translation. Stand still a whyle who passeth bye, What I shall say marke carefully: Whose fame all England could not hould. Of death his honour is contrould. His bodie now to small vse good. His counsell erst in great stead stood. A carefull man, what tongue can say, Now care is past and fled away. His bones here lye, his soule on hye Is placed aboue the starrie skye. Emblema. 4. NOBJLJSSIMIS DVOBVS ADOLESCENTVLIS Rutlandiæ &amp; Bedfordiæ Comitibus in Academia Cantabrigiensi vitam studiosam agentibus. Generosa soboles. Comiti Rutl. The same in English. Three marks hence learne whereby to know, The blessed happie seede, As quiver fraught with arrowes, so Children stand in like steed. Cantic.4.1. / Psal.128.3. And as the lockes adorne the head. So children comely bee, About the table set for bread, They stand as oliue tree. This Embleme noble youth by right Is yours, your part then take, Not arrow, or oliue branch in sight Or lockes such shew doe make, As of you your stocke may reioyce Which shew grandfathers face, To follow then now make your choice Your auncestors vertuous race. Emblema. 5. COMITI BEDFORDIAE dulcissimo iuveni. Angelorum ministerium. The same in English. The Angels power and readines Ezech.1.12. These things set downe doe well expresse: Three payre of wings from them proceede, Two serue their turne to flie with speed, Two from Gods presence their face fould, And two their feete least we behold: They haue foure lookes, first as a man, As Lion, Eagle, and Bullock than, Mans face their reason doth declare, And Lionlike so strong they are, Like eagles they doe flye apace, And follow, as Oxe ground doth trace. Their hands are mens, our workes they doe. Their feete like calues are round to go: Euen thus doe you, ô Cherubs face, So Scripture doth such call: With manly knowledge you must grace Your younger yeres with all. As eagle you must flye amaine, Your vertue let be knowne, As lyon strong, as oxe in paine, Such seed in you be sowen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prima classis Emblematum typocorum. Emblema 6. Reuerendissimo in Christo Patri, Episcopo Londinensi. EPISCOPI ORNAMENTA The same in English. The Priestlike garments you shall see, with gold and stones beset to be, The minister in minde must agree, with this attyre. The garments couer euery part, all giftes the other in his heart Must haue, and to his flocke impart, as they desire. The belles hang thicke, and giue a sound, the Preachers voyce must be heard round, Away ye mute, let them abound, that pulpit ring. The Tribes names are grauen in his brest, Exod.28. the Pastor must be readie prest, To pray for all, and more earnest prayers to bring. Vrim and Thummim giuen him are, with knowledge his life must not iarre, But both must prosper and wel fare, and grow apace. Holines to God, vpon his head is writ, that he him selfe with dread Should pray, and teach others that read, to call for grace. The Papists by attire discerne their priests, but wee to iudge doe learne By doctrine pure, and the lanterne, of a good race. EMBLEM. 7. Piorum conditio. The same in english. Psal.125.1. Then mountaines what can stronger bee? They doe remaine so sure, The earth thou sooner moued shalt see, It can not so endure. The mountaines one may soone descrie, Although he be not neere, A citie who can not espie, That doth aloft appeare? The hils which are so neere to skie, The tempest first doth take, The regions which are set so hie, The wind doth soonest shake. The righteous sort may be compared Vnto a loftie hill, Whose state can no waies be empaired, As th'other standeth still. And like he is in that his life, Must be as set on tower. Who soonest is pursued with strife. As winde on hill hath power. Emblem. 8. Ecclesia veritatis columna.Ex Zach. 4. 3. The same in english. The Prophet espieth a golden candlesticke, Seauen burning lamps shine in the top thereof, So many pipes there are, which oyle minister, Two oliue trees, which vpon each side doe stand, The Prophet seeth, they giue oyle abundantlie.

The captaine when h'hath pitcht his field, Iob.29.25. Encourage will his souldiers hartes, The huswife taskes t'ner maydes doth yeeld, The chiefe that mournth, doth point the partes.

Doth represent Christs little barke, For as the Lord did Noah teach, The Church doth here Christ onely preach, Without the ship they perish all, Without the Church men erre and fall, The waters vp the arke did beare, This type to Baptisme commeth neare. As Cham was saued among the rest, So hypocrites liue with the best, Wolues, lambs, kids, lions, haue one place, So cruell men once cald finde grace. With flood and weather th'Arke is tost, So is the Church but nothing lost, For as the pitch the ship doth keepe, So faith preserueth in perils deepe. Emblem. 19.

A riuer from the altar floweth fast, It th' ankles first, then toucheth knees and waste, And afterward it doeth arise so hye That none afoote can passe or come thereby, The bitter streames it makes to savour well, Much fish doeth breede, good trees in fruite excell, But standing puddels smell. This riuer shewth, how Gods worde first did spring. At length prevailes, though small in the beginning, VVhat euill we haue by nature it doeth heale, And many maketh to Christs Church to appeale. The fishermen the faithfull Preachers be, The righteous man is as a fruitfull tree, The wicked are more filthie. Emblem. 21. Impijsterminos transilire vetitum.Zach. 5. The Translation.

So God doeth checke the wicked race, and sinners are contrould, Euen as the lyd is put in place, the woman downe to hould.

The harlot hereupon doeth ride, VVith purple robes, and crowne on head, A deadly cup she hath beside. To her euen kings do bow the knee, Thus Antichrist deciphered see As if in marble grauen were hee. He sits at Rome, where was times past Th'empire, of him kings hold in fee, With heresie he the world doth waste, A bloudie one, yet God would be. The city with seauen hilles beset, Is Rome it selfe, to be seene yet. Who sitt'h in Church, and claims Christs place, And roome to haue, and glad would raigne, Who doth Gods word so much disgrace, By Tiber sitt'h, as did Sibill faine, His bonnet white, Pontifex his name? The Pope him selfe, that thinkes it no shame: Whome doth Gods word already wound, And feare none other weapons need: The Pope, whome Gospell doth confound, God graunt his truth may with all speede, This mistie darkenes away chace, And when he com'th, him vtterly deface. Emblema. 23. Nihil fortuito.Ezech. 1. 19. The same in English. The wheel doth not it selfe turne round, Vnlesse the horse doe drawe: But in the same place still is found, Where thou before it saw.

So when Gods word is set at naught, And men doe it despise, It profits not the man vntaught, Nor yet him that is wise. Emblema. 25. Bene agendo nunquam defessus. M. L. C. FIDELISSIMO PASTORI Coll. E. præfecto. The translation. The fisher doth his net Cast forth that he may get at length some fish to haue his wish. Hope cherisheth his minde, Which he doth finde, when fish are caught in sea that wraught. He oft returnd before Hauing small fish in store, yet he againe with bait doth traine. The Church is the fishing place, The fishers ministers of grace, they lay their gin to draw men in. Alwaies though they preuaile Can not, but sometime fayle, for the wicked sort doth not like this sport. For all this they not cease, But forward still must prease, God will them send an happie end.

So to the poore doe freely giue, though thou no reward find, God will requite, what thou bestowest, and beare it in his mind.

The translation. The woman which her groat hath lost, with light doth search the ground, Shee sweepes the house, the dust is tost, vntill the siluer's found. So God doth, as with candle light, the wicked soone espie, He causeth them out of his sight, as chaffe away to flie. But he the righteous will find out, he can not long be hid, But as when dust is throwen about, they are from darkenes rid. Emblema. 29. Qui linguaiurat, mentem non iniuratam gerit.

Emblema 36. AVARUS. The Translation. Eccles.5.15. / Hab.2.6 &amp; 13. Here one the winde would catch in hand, another workes in fire: The third doth digge for heauy sand, and stirres in stinking mire.

The same in English. Christ is the sheapheard; we the sheepe, He feedeth, we are fed, But many doe besides flockes keepe, Yet is there but one head, In time to come we shal it see, Vnder one sheaphard all must be. The Iewes from vs doe feed apart, Two heards we are a while, One day they shall be knit in heart Faith shall them reconcile, The prophete Paul did so foretell, Rom.11. ad finem. That God againe with them would dwell. If straungers wee graft in doe take, they shall sprout foorth indeede, As roote doeth braunches holy make, so Abram doeth his seede. They are not cleane put to reproofe, But whilest we enter stand aloofe. Th'Apostles shall not finish all the townes of lud a land, Till Christ, who must to iudgement call, of vs account demaund. Two people shall in one be knit, And Israel the name of it. Who pearced was beholde they shall with griefe as in the vale, They wept where did Iosia fall, so Christ they shall bewaile. They mourne not yet, but ere 't is long, Their hearts shall yeeld that are so strong The vayle which doeth them ouerspread, from them shall then be rent, To Christs feete they shall runne with speede, when as they shall repent. Thus shepherd one is, and sheepe folde, If Iewes with vs of one house holde. We wish that this time come may soone. that we may ioyned be, And so in heauen, as here all one, be of one companie. Thus three wayes we are ioynd in loue, To vs, to God, to the Saints aboue. Emblema 39. MATERFAMILIAS Dottissimæ fæminæ &amp; prudentiss. Matronæ D.Baconæ. The Translation.

She buyeth a feld and there plants doeth set, She as by shipping her foode doeth get, She sel'th to marchants, to poore doeth lend, Her happie broode doeth her commend. Your praise exceedes, to studie bent As time in huswifery there is spent The poore she, you the learned feede, The house doeth hers, your fame they spread.

Shee bindth the partes, doeth cut the string, at fire he is helde Lying in lappe, to doe euery thing she thus doeth yeelde. In labour thus and travaile great the mother is worne, The poore and they of princely seate are all thus borne. As from the darke the childe is sent, couered with blood, Him selfe but weake, as in prison pent can doe small good: As we are borne, such is our life, so is our death, Our birth and age are full of strife, thus we let our breath. Hence then I say with pride so vaine, let it decay, For we are all of earthly traine, and must away. Emblema. 41. Post hac occasso calva. The same in English. Exod.16.

In the house toppe, a vision sent Fom heauen, he seeth a fouresquare sheete, The corners knit eche other meete, Full of all sortes of beastes both cleane And vncleane also there are seene. A voyce was heard, kill, Peter, eate: Then he, no Lord, not vncleane meate. The voyce againe, do not thou take For vncleane, what God holy doeth make.

Mvch beter is, then Lion dead A dogg that liueth and doth breath, The Lion which the beasts did dread, Now voide of strength doth lye beneath, The dogg doth breath and is aliue, The shrubs though low, which spring &amp; thriue, The cedars tale cutt downe suruiue: Euen so who life doth yet enioy, Though poore, much better is his case, Then he whose carcase death doth annoye Depriued of his honourable place: For whilest that breath and life doe last, Hope out of doores is not yet cast, But death doth all thinges soone lay wast.

Emblema. 80.Cant. 5. 9. Animi constantia. The translation. The Cedar in Lebanon and the oke Doe constancie both teach, The wind cannot giue such a stroke To make in them a breach, Gods countenance so can not change, And righteous men thinke nothing strange.

The rider, whilest the horse doth pricke Ier.12.5. He runneth swift away And foming, with his feet doth kicke, Whome bridle can not stay.

Emblem. 86. De moro. Qui pulchra affectat ardua perferat. The same in English. The mulbery in dry ground doth grow, From whence the valley had the name, By which the people sometime came To Sion hill, but with much sorrow: For, whylest they went, they thirstie were, And water out of pits did draw, At length they Sion fountaine saw, Which they did labour to draw neere: To vs affliction this valley is, Which we with patience still must beare, Sustaining all things with good cheere, With Christs Church to receiue a blisse.

The whirlpoole in the sea doth raigne Iob.41. As the elephant no beast doth staine, Like to the Whale of bignes maine they both are sure So fast to him doth cleaue his skin, The winde can no where enter in, No corde him holdeth nor no gin he can endure. From his mouth commeth fiery blast, From nostrels he doth water cast, The waues arise, sea huge and wast as a pot doth playe: His heart of stone, his flesh of brasse, His body of an huge compasse, His chawes as dores, with teeth alasse, he doth men dismay. Speare, sword, dart, he doth laugh to scorn, And launce, brasse is as straw of corne, As rotten wood mettall is torne, nothing can him feare. Wherefore let vs worship Gods name, And from our hearts adore the same By's hand these creatures of great fame created were. Iob. 39.Emblem. 91.

Such of our mindes should be the sight That we with setled eyes thus might, Behold what is in heauens bright, layde vp in store. Shee doth the carcase soone espy And with her young ones company Com'th downe, and on her pray doth lye with talents sore, We ought to haue all the like minde, Our Sauiour Christ to seeke and finde, Him to desire, as doth food kinde the stomacke craue. Emblem. 92. Divina tutela. Eidem. The same in English. The Eagle loe is made to flye, Iob.39. A boy betweene her wings doth lye. He earth and sea doth safe espye vnder his feet. The young ones are by damme thus brought, Which at length by experience taught, Aloft on mothers backe vp caught the ayre doe beat. So God for his doth care for best, On his shoulders we all must rest, Euen as the child in mothers brest doth lye so sweet. Emblem. 93. Cauete à canibus.Phil. 3. 2. The same in English. Psal.56.14. The dogge doth barking runne by night Snatching at euery thing, Whose nature soone vnto thy sight, The wicked man may bring.

Be thou not like this doggish kinde, By diligence learne good things to finde. Emblem. 94. Hypocritæ progenies viperarum. The Translation. The viper after deadly bite, the water doth desire, Mat.3.7. VVho outwardly is faire to sight, but burn'th within as fire: VVhen damme the viper hath brought foorth, shee is depriued of life, These properties, for to speake troth, with hypocrites are rife. For as to water they doe runne, things holy to pertake, And baptisme too, yet what is done, doth nothing for them make: VVithout a goodly shew is made, yet euill they are in hart, And they which teach the heauenly trade, of their tongues feele the smart. Emblem. 95. Regis authoritas. Non est ei, qui dicat Domine cur facis sic?Eccles. 8. 3. The translation. The winde doth sift both corne and cloud, Prov.20.8. &amp; 26.

A grayhound, goate and Lion eke these three haue all a comely gate, So goeth the king, whom people seeke To honour, not to impayre his state. Emblem. 97. Bestiarum prudentia. The same in English. Prov.30.24. The conye, spider and grassehopper with th'ant these fower, Of wit some strength, though small and proper they haue and power. The ant doth gather in sommer tide, meate for her vse, The wise man all things doth prouide without excuse. In rocke rhe conie her selfe to saue doth build most sure, So we in heauen an house must haue which may endure, The grassehoppers by rankes you see to leape in field: So men ought iointly to agree and in heart yeild. The spider euen in princes place her web doth spin: So a wise man with prince find'th grace and doth come in. Emblem. 98. Prov. 30. 3 Contentionis fructus. The same in English. The charned milke doth butter bring, From strifefull men so wrath doth spring, Where wordes doe rule, strife can not cease, As fire with wood doth straite encrease, As waters opened enlarge the breath, So fightings follow oft shrewd speach. Emblem. 99. Donorum fallacia. The same in English. As precious stone in hand Prov.17.8. Though turned oft doth shine, So gifts doe alwaies stand, All things they vndermine. Emblem. 100. Peccati fibræ. The Translation. Ier.13.23. &amp; 17.1. The blacke Moore will not change his skin, Nor Leopard his spotte, So he that doth delight in sinne, Shall still retayne a blotte. VVhat's writ in brasse can not soone perish And stonie harts doe sinne long cherish. So gentle reader if thou finde Ought worthie here thine eare: As grauen in brasse, so you in minde What well is said, may beare. But if my verse doe chaunce to misse, Forgiue the fault, a scape it is. FINIS.</field>
