      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT Honorable and truely Noble-minded, Sir John Swinnerton Knight, Lord Maior of the Citie of London, Sir Thomas Middleton, and Sir Iohn Iolles, Aldermen, his Brethren.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Muse. Goe Muse, that like Endimion did'st but dreame Of Golden dayes in thy Dispairefull Night; And stood'st like Tantale in a Siluer-streame, That fed thy longing with a false delight: Ope thy dull eyes, and while that others weepe, Say, what thou saw'st, since thou hast beene asleepe. And yet had'st beene, had not (Oh Brightest Faire) Chast Cynthia with her fauours wakened me, And His deere Loue, whose losse I shaddow here, Enforc'd a taske of latest Pietie: Else better farre, we had beene silent still; And slept vnseene vpon a peacefull Hill. THE PERIOD of Mourning. I. Vision. I saw (me thought) from Cambers hilly shore, A goodly Arke, as euer eye beheld; Whose Sayles were Silke, and Tackle twined Oare, That seem'd reflected, gloriously to guild The waue around, while thousand colours faire, Kept time aloft with euery little ayre. She Archon hight, for that she had no Peere, And could command the Ocean with her might: In whom the Hopes of many thousands were, But chiefly of the Muse, and Martiall sprite: Braue Man of warre she was, from Britaine bound, For new discoueries all that might be found. And going out, shee did beguile the way, With sound of Trumpet, Shawmes and Cornet shrill, That fil'd the shore, and seem'd to charme the Sea; (For windes were ceas'd, and waues were calme and stil.) Such peales of Thunder, then anone were sent, As if she would haue torne the Firmament. But sodainely the Day was ouercast, A tempest hurles the billow to the Skye, That Cables brake, and hauing spent her Mast Shee fell on Rocks; herewith I heard a cry Of dying men; who perish'd on the shelues, Saue some, that knew to swim, and saue themselues. VVhich when I saw, a streame of Teares I shed, And said (O God) who did commit the sinne, That such a Treasure should be buried In lowest Graue, as it had neuer bin? A fraught wherein we shared euery one, And by whose losse three Kingdomes are vndone. II. Vision. I saw a Palme, of body tall and straight, Vpon whose braunches Crownets did depend; But for the top, were kept a cumbrous waight Of three more great: inough to force it bend, (For little wot we managing of Realmes, The howerly cares and charge of Diadems.) And euery bough did bloome with fruitfull store, Wherein all kindes of singing Birds did build, Melodiously reioycing euermore In his deere aide, by whom they were vpheld: And hither oft, the shepheard would repaire, If heate did scortch, or cloude accloie the Aire. But at the roote, a fearefull Serpent lay, (Whose many mischiefes Time forbids me tell,) That vndermin'd the Body night and day, That last, it downe with hideous fragor fell, To griefe of all; mine eye did neuer see, More hopefull Blossomes, or a fairer Tree. III. Vision. A wood there was, along the Stygian Lake, Where Night, and euerlasting Horror dwell, Herein a Caue, two hollow Rockes did make, From whence a Brooke as blacke as Lethe fell: A common roade led thither, with descent So steepe, that none return'd that euer went. It was an vncouth Dungeon, darke and wide, Where liuing man nere was, or light had shone, Saue that a little glimmering I espi'de From rotten stickes, that all about were throwne: The Boxe and banefull Eugh-tree grew without, All which a stinking ditch did moate about. Within, there hung vpon the ragged wals Sculs, shirtes of maile, whose owners had beene slaine Escotcheons, Epitaphes of Funerals; In bottles teares of friends, and Louers vaine: Spades, Mattockes, models, boltes and barres for strength, With bones of Giants of a wondrous length. Beneath, all formes of Monuments were seene, Whose superscriptions were through age defac'd, And owners long agoe consumed cleane But now as coffers were in order plac'd, Wherein inditements lay, charmes, Dead-mens wills Popes pardons, pleas, and Pothecaries bills. In mid'st there sat a meagre wretch alone, That had in sorrow both his ei'n outwept, And was with pine become a Sceleton: I ask'd him why that loathsome Caue he kept, And what he was: my name (quoth he) is Death Perplexed here, for Henries losse of breath. Henrie the good, the great, vnware I hit VVith deadly dart before the timely day, For at one neere him while I leuel'd it, That sent more soules then I my selfe away, Or feare, or fate the arrow did misguide That he escap'd, and Noblest Henry di'd. With that, he bad me to retire in hast, For neuer any came so neere his dore, And liu'd: here-with mine eye a side I cast, Where stood a glue-pot, Canes and quiuers store, And on a shelfe, lay many stinking weedes, Wherewith, I ghesse, he poison'd arrow heads. By doubtfull tracks away through Brake and Breere, I left the VVood, and light at last did view, When Death I heard accused euery where, As Theife and Traytor, of the vulgar crew, For this misdeed, hee sware against his will; For who knew Henry could not meane him ill. IIII. Vision. I saw erewhile, conducted forth by Fame A Carre Triumphall, all of massie Gold, And Three of England and that one of Scotland. foure fierce Lyons yoaked in the same, The which a Virgin, louely to behold, With gentle raine did guide and show the way, She Vnitie. Vna hight, none else they would obay. A warlick Impe within was set on high, Who Phœbus, in his glorious armes out-shone, Ydrad of all for awfull Maiestie, Yet louing, and more loued liued none; Hight Philocles, whom Fame did thus addresse To high designes, which few or none could ghesse. But oh vncertaine state of all below, And feeble stay whereon our hopes doe rest! While that I gazed rauish'd with the show And heart did leape for ioy within my breast, From Heauen I saw discend a fiery wand And all to blacke was turned out of hand. Carricks white Lions in a field of Red, His golden Garbes as Chesters Palatine, The Cornish Beasaunts seldome quartered, Rothsay with that braue Coate of Leoline, VVhich one-day might in field of Mars haue flowne, Before his Herse were mournfull streamers showne. The gallant Steede that did disdaine the bit, And shooke with angry hoofe the hollow ground, His Riders losse lamented ouer it: The Souldiour with his Drumme and Trumpets sound That beate the March, and blew the furious charge, VVere turn'd to Singers timing of his Dirge. The fiery spirit whose aspiring flame Brake out enkindled at his glorious light Grew dimme and damp'd, as dying with the same; The gentle Heart in mourning melted quite, His Friends and louers (We) did weare his blacke VVithin the Breast, while others on the Backe. But in the while we haue related this, The Corps was gone and euery thing was past, That there remained nothing but his Misse, VVhich when I saw mine eyes to Heauen I cast, And said, Oh let me neuer liue I pray, To feele the griefe of such another day. V. Vision. I lay to rest by those two Sister-streames, That striue with each as seemeth by their hast, VVho to her spouse should take the stately Thames, (For both into his bosome fall at last;) VVhere, one I heard as Thracian Orpheus sing, VVith Beast and Bird about him listening. Come VVoods (quoth he) and VVaters lend your sound, And help vs to bemone our Dions death, Come euery Plant that growes vpon the ground, Your fruit or sauours to his Herse bequeath, Come purple Roses, purest Lillies turne Your Beauties blacke, and help a while to mourne. Come Albion Muses, come sweet Philomel, Report this newes among thy mournefull straines, To greenie Groues the Death of Dion tell, Ye Shepheards fill here-with the fruitfull plaines, At Morne and Euen, and say, with Dion dead, All Musicke and our Merry daies are fled. Come Albion Muses, come ye siluer Swannes Sing dying and die singing on the bankes Of Isis flood, come wood Musitians Surround him sleeping in your painted ranckes, Leaue wanton Naiads treading of your rings And teach your eyes to ouerflow the springs. Come Albion Muses bid Menalcas sit With broken reede beside his aged Oke, And solitary there some dittie fit That mought to teares infernall Dis prouoke: Eternall silence dwell on Dale and hill, And Heards vnkept goe wander where you will. Come Albion Muses, come with Eccho mourne In hollow Rockes and vales, for Dion gone, Who (like his lips) shall neuer more returne, A gratious answere call'd by you vpon: Die flowers, and fall ye fruit vnripe from Trees And cease your toile (the sweetest gone) ye Bees. Come Albion Muses, neuer Dolphin wept More kindly, cast by Neptune on the shore, Or Memnons Bird with greater sorrow kept Auroras sonne, whom still she weepeth ore, Or groue with plaints of Philomela rung VVhen Plough-man had bereft her of her young. Calliope more woefull did not seeke, Her Loued Homer all about the Sea, Or Venus on her deere Adonis cheeke, More kisses heaped as he dying lay, As Albion now who (mother-like) in vaine, VVould, spight of Nature, weepe him backe againe. If in a graden but the Mallow die, The Daisie, Dill, or Rose, it liues agen, And shooteth yeerely from his bed on high, But we endu'de with Reason who are men, Much fairer, stronger, if we once doe fall, No more on Earth our being haue at all. Much more he would haue said but that with griefe, His voyce did faile and hand began to slacke, VVherewith approached first of Beasts the chiefe, VVho in their kindes bewailed Dions lacke: The Birds aboue, in Trees were set aloft, Each chattering in his note as Nature taught. None for precedence stroue, that they forgat, As ill befitting pensiuenesse of heart, But as they came in Louing league they sat, And each to each his sorrow did impart: For griefes doe grow by many bearers weake, That else the backes of one or two would breake Three Lyons white full bitterly did groane, And waile his absence whom they loued deere, Aloofe the Noble personages of the land whose Crests these are. Heliconian Horse did moane, For as the rest he could not come so neere. The Lynx, the Bufle, and the Talbot true, Did (as they could) their vtmost sorrow shew. The Greyhound, Griffon, Tiger, and the Goate, Two gallant Dragons greene, and one of Red, The Vnicorne in his faire Ermine-coate, The Roebucke, Bore, and Bull, for combat bred: The Leopard, Wiuerne, Munkey, and the Beare, The Tiger, Cat, and Porcespine were there. Of Birds, I saw the Eagle sharpe of sight, Th' Arabian Phœnix, and the Peacocke gay, The towring Falcon for the Kings delight, The Chough, the Rauen, and dainty Popingaie, The Swanne with Pheasaunt fetch'd from Phasis flood, And Pellican soare wounded with her brood. With others numberlesse both wilde and tame, By flockes that hither in a Moment flew, But as I neere to this assembly came, Their order, kindes, and cullors for to view, The Man, the Musicke, Bird, and Beast were gone, I left to mourne disconsolate alone. VI. Vision. I was conducted by a louely childe, Whose haire outshone the brightest burning gold, Of sweet aspect as Maid, and modest milde, Vnto that place where certainely is told, The soules of such as here had liued well, Disroab'd of Earth in happinesse doe dwell. It was Elisium, a delightfull plaine, Where Zephyre makes an euerlasting Spring, And Fruits, and Flowers, doe all the yeere retaine Their tast and beauties, sweetest Birds doe sing In Laurell shades, where coolest siluer brookes Diuorce their courses by a thousand crookes. Within there was a Theater of gold, Rais'd on a mount in semi-circle wise, Which stately columnes strongly did vphold, That by ascent did ouer other rise, And railde betweene with Christall lights that shone Against the Sunne like Rockes of Diamond. Not Scaurus Scæne might with this same compare, That eightie thousand could at one time hold, Nor that of Pompey, nor that wounder rare Vespasian reard, nor that with pouldred gold Which Nero (as with sand I read bestrew) And seel'd with silke all starry gilt in blew. Three rowes it had where Princes onely sat, To view their worldly miseries foregone, Their Kingdomes changes and to contemplate Their happinesse in full fruition: These liued well, or for the Faith were slaine, Or younglings were who neuer saw their raigne. Each were in order rancked as they dy'd, The formost, Heire apparants of our land, VVhose deaths were by Impresas specifide, So sweetly limn'd as by an Angels hand. Hee was drowned at 17 yeeres of age, comming into England out of Normandie William first Henries sonne did giue a sea Enrag'd, aboue was written, Cast away. The sonne of Stephen Prince Eustace being angry with his Father Stephen for making peace with Henry Duke of Normandie departed from him Eustace next did sit, Who gaue a braunch of bitter Hellebore, Dispayre's not holpe was scored ouer it. Henry the sonne of second Henry bore A Phaeton, with this, Too soone I clime, A King and Rebell in my Fathers time. Appeared then, in Armes, a goodly Prince Of swarthy Edward the blacke Prince, first sonne to Edward the 3. hew, by whom there hung a Launce Of wondrous length, preserued euer since Hee ouerthrew at Poiteirs Iohn of Fraunce: A Dial his deuice, the stile at One, And this, No night and yet my day is done. By him I saw in white a comely Prince Edward who was slaine at Tewksbury. youth, Vpon whose breast appear'd a gaping wound (That would haue mou'd a heart of Flint to ruth) Wherewith the place was smeared all around. A withered crimson Rose by him was fixt, His word, The last, as sonne of Henry sixt. A little lower sat two King Edward the fift, and Richard his Brother beauteous Impes Of smyling cheere, as fresh as flower in May: Not Tyndaris faire twinnes, Plerian Nimphes, Or Myrrha's Boy so louely faire as they: These were the Brother-Princes that in bed The Tyrant slew and left vnburied. One had a Pillow with his crowne thereon, His Mot, The Price of my eternall rest: The other gaue a Vulture ceasing on The heart of Titius, with, The Tyrants breast. Prince Arthur maried Catharine, Daughter of Ferdinando king of Spaine. By this deuice the Author seemes couertly to shew a distast of our Princes matching with Spaine.Prince Arthur, this, aboue an Orange flower Though seemes the fayrest yet the fruit is sower. The last sat our late Henry on a Throne By one degree rais'd higher then the rest; About whose brow an heauenly glory shone, And certaine beames appeared from his breast, Which who so did with neerer eye admire Were striken blinde, or had their hearts on fire. Where when I saw that Brow, that Cheeke, that Eye, Hee left imprinted in Eliza's face, That louely cheere and gracefull Maiestie In hopefull Charles that take their second place. With Ioy surprized to my home before I bad returne, wee cared for no more. FINIS. A EPICEDIVM of the Author. Stay Royall Body ere thou go'st To sleepe in Mothers armes, the dust: And let our Teares distilling fast, Embalmne thy Louely Limmes the last, Whom Heauen so deere while here did hold, It tooke both Modell and the mold From Nature, least there might remaine, A hope to haue his like againe: Henrie too to forward Rose, Henrie terror to his foes, Henrie Friendes and Fathers stay, Henrie Sunne-rise of our Day, Henrie Loadstar of the Arts, Henrie Loadstone of all harts. But now our bud hath bid the frost, And Britaine, warlike Arthur lost: Friendes and fathers want their stay, And ouer-clouded is our day, This starre is fallen from our sight, And lost with all our compasse quite. Oh losse of losses, griefe of griefe, Beyond compassion or reliefe! But was our young Iosias shot From Babell, Ægypt ward or not? His Iourney scarsly yet begunne, Or was this deede by Heauen done? The cause were Earths all Horrid crimes, Hatch'd in these faithlesse fruitlesse times: 'Tis sinne hath drawne the deluge downe Of all these teares, wherein we drowne, Wherein not onely we are drent, But all the Christian continent; Yea vtmost climes and coastes vnknowne, Whereto his winged Fleete is flowne, Whose Pilot while the Maister sleepes, Is sounding of the Northerne deepes, Encountring Icie Mountaines, Coasts, Rak'd vp in Snowes, or bound with frosts: Who saue the Deitie diuine, Could say the depth of his designe? As when a Comet doth amaze, The world with it's prodigious blaze, While in some pitchie night, from North, Sword brandisht flames it shooteth forth, All ghessing what it might portend, Or where th'effect would fall it'h end, So when this youth in Armor shone, He was with terror look'd vpon, Which way mought turne his sword or launce, To Turke, to Spaine, to Roome, or Fraunce: But this a Meteor was, no Starre Imperfect mixt as glories are; Though Belus terme himselfe a God, And Commodus beare Hermes rod: Marcellus call in thunder downe, From Heauen, an artificiall crowne, Clearchus in his charge beare fire, Augustus clepe the Sunne his Sire, Domitian his owne Mother scorne, To say of Pallas he was borne, Yet all are Adams earthy weake, Adord like Idols till they breake; Become the scorne of Time and Fate, And obiects of the meanest Hate. By Bodkins greatest Cæsar's dead, A Shepherdesse take Cyrus head, A Weasils bite kils Aristide, And Lice did punish Herods pride: Blinde Times ascribing these to be Th'effects of Fate or Destinie Ineuitable; mocking vs With th' Ato'mes of Democritus. The Soule of this which VVorld we call, Or Influence Cœlestiall, 'Tis no Ægyptian Iron Line, But prouidence of Power Diuine; VVhose high Idæas are beeings, And all Essentiall formes of things, Disposing of all here below, Whose ends himselfe doth onely know: Who made a cord of seuerall sinne, To whip vs out, or hold vs in. That what Rome of her Titus said May to late Henry be applyed; That he for his owne good is gone, But for our full affliction: For whose deare losse, oh let the Towers Of each heauen-daring crime of ours Be cast to ground, as Carthage were, When she her Princes death did heare: And to expresse her sorrow more, Her wals with blacke quite couer'd o'er. Or with th'Ægyptians let vs mourne Tenne times seauen dayes about his Vrne: Or strow his Herse with bud and bloome, As Thetis her Achilles Tombe: Or crowne his Ashes left to vs, As they did of Demetrius: Or hang, with Athens, Laurell by, In signall of his Victory, Triumphing ouer Sinne and Death, Wherewith wee struggle still beneath; That happy thus, why (fooles) doe wee With vainest vowes sollicite thee? Teares after teares to Heauen send, That should vpon our selues descend? But rather let thee quiet rest, Where thou perpetually art blest: Then farewell Henry heauenly Iemme, Adorning new Hierusalem; Farewell thy Britaines broken Shield; Farewell the Honor of the Field; Farewell the Ioy of King and Mother; Farewell Eliza's dearest Brother; Farewell the Church and Learnings prop; Farewell the arme that held me vp; Farewell the golden dayes of mirth; Farewell the best-best Prince of earth; Farewell. Perforce I cease to mourne, For teares mine Inke to water turne. To the buried Prince. Hee alludeth to that famous worke of Henry the seauenths Chappell, so contriued, that from euery window in the same, in the Foundation, a line was laid to the Kings Graue, and in the same to his heart, as hee ordaidained it in his life.As from each angle of the Vault, Wherein thou lyest, a line is brought Vnto the Kingly founders heart; So vnto thee, from euery part, See how our loues doe runne by line, And dead, concenter in thy Shrine. An Elegiacke EPITAPH vpon the vntimely death of the hopefull Prince HENRIE, &amp;c. VVritten by the Author, at the time of his Death. VVho ere thou art that passest by, And canst not read for weeping eye Our interrupted Lines, or speake For sighes, that swollen hart would breake; Imagine Heauens and Earth reply, Our Hopes are fal'n, and here they lye: For Griefe her selfe is stricken dumbe, To see this worthiest worthies toombe, And Earth to hide from mortall sight The worlds sole wonder and delight, The richest lemme ere Nature wrought For prizeles forme, of purest thought, For chast desire, for Churches zeale, For care and loue of common weale; For manly shape, for actiue might, For Courage and Heroique sprit, For Loue of Armes and Heauenly Arts, For Bounty toward all best deserts: That euen by Teares of yet vnborne, His Marble wilbe wash'd and worne: For liuing we, though deadly shot, Stand at the gaze but feele it not. Oh neuer land had such a losse But certaine soule thou art but gone; To thy new coronation, Thy presence Heauen, thy state a Throne Thy Carpet Starres, to tread vpon, Full glory for a Crowne of gold, Out shining this accursed mold. For awfull Scepter, or thy Rod A palme; thy friends, the Saints of God: VVhen Parasite, nor Spangled groome, VVith Courtiers vaine accloy thy roome, VVhere Sisters, friends, thy comming greete, VVith Himnes and Hallelu iahs sweet. That from the height of blisse aloft Thou view'st me thinkes our Mansion oft: Braue Hampton checking Heauen with state; Or Richmond, thy belou'd of late, And bidst Adiew these heapes of clay, Cares restles roomes, Innes for a day. Oh that the Heauens deny it me, Here loathing life, to follow thee! But till my death I weare my dayes In Zealous teares, and in thy praise, Since I may neuer line to see A Prince, or Henrie, like to thee. FINIS. Nuptiall Hymnes: IN HONOR OF the Marriage. 1 All Feares are fled, and from our Sphære The late Eclipse is vanish'd quite: And now we entertaine the yeare With Hymenæus chaste delight: Heauen, the first, hath throwne away Her weary weede of mourning hew, And waites Eliza's Wedding-day In Starry-spangled Gowne of blew. The Huntresse in her siluer Carre, The Woods againe suruaieth now: And that same bright Idalian Starre Appeares on Vespers vailed brow: Let Earth put on her best aray, Late bath'd in eye-distilled showers; And melt yee bitter Frosts away, That kill'd the forward Hope of ours. Yee highest Hils that harbour Snowes, And arme your heads with Helmes of Ice, Be Gardens for the Paphian Rose, The Lilly, Violet, or De-lis: Low Vallies let your Plaines be spread With painted Carpets of the Spring, (Whereon Eliza's foote must tread) And euery where your odours fling. And tallest Trees, with tender'st Twigs, Whom Winters-Storme hath stripped bare, Leaue off those rimy Periwigs, And on with your more seemely haire. Forget yee siluer-paued Flouds, Your wonted rage, and with your souud Reuiue the Shores and shady Woods, That lay in deepest sorrow drown'd. Tell Amphitrite, when you meete, Eliza, Princesse, is a Bride: And bid her with the Newes goe greete The farthest Shoares at euery Tyde; And as yee wash high towred wals, With gentle murmure in each eare, Command these Royall Nuptials Be solemnized euery where. Let Thracian Boreas keepe within, With Easterne Blasts that crops doe kill, And Auster wetting to the skinne; Be onely Zephyre breathing still, Warme Zephyre to perfume the Ayre, And scatter downe in siluer Showers A thousand Girlonds for her haire Of Blossome, Branch, and sweetest flowers. With Rosemarine, and verdant Bay, Be wall and window clad in greene: And sorrow on him who this day In Court a Mourner shall be seene. Let Musicke shew her best of skill, Disports beguile the irkesome night. But take my Muse thy ruder Quill, To paint a while this royall sight: Proclaiming first from Thames to Rhine Eliza Princesse Palatine. 2 Nymphes of Sea and Land away, This, Eliza's Wedding day, Helpe to dresse our gallant Bride With the treasures that yee hide: Some bring flowry Coronets, Roses white, and Violets: Doris gather from thy Shore Corall, Chrystall, Amber, store, Which thy Queene in Bracelets twist For her Alabaster wrist, While yee Siluer-footed Girles Plat her Tresses with your Pearles. Others from Pactolus streame, Greete her with a Diademe: Search in euery Rockie Mount For the lemmes of most account: Bring yee Rubies for her Eare, Diamonds to fill her Hayre, Emrald greene and Chrisolite Binde her Necke more white then white. On her Breast depending be The Onyx, friend to Chastitie; Take the rest without their place, In borders, Sleeues, her Shooes, or Lace. Nymphes of Niger offer Plumes: Some your Odors and Perfumes. Dians Maids more white then milke, Fit a Roabe of finest Silke: Dians maids who wont to be The Honor of Virginitie. Heauens haue bestow'd their grace, Her chaste desires, and Angels face. 3 Uranias Sonne, who dwell'st vpon The fertile top of Helicon, Chaste Marriage Soueraigne, and dost leade The Virgin to her Bridall Bed. Io Hymen Hymenæus. With Marioram begirt thy brow, And take the Called in Latine Flammeum it was of a yealowish colour &amp; worne of the Romane Virgins going to be marryed, to conceale &amp; hide their blushing and bashfulnes. Veile of yealow: now Yee Plutarch saith these Torches were of waxe, like ours; Plautus onely once mentioneth one of these waxen Lights, but for the most part, they were of Pine or thorne tree. Pinie Torches with your light, To golden day conuert the night. Io Hymen Hymenæus. See how like the Cyprian Queene, Eliza comes, as when (I weene) On Ida hill the prize she had Allotted by the Phrygian Lad. Io Hymen Hymenæus. As Asian Myrtle fresh and faire, Which Hamadryads with their care, And duely tending by the flouds, Haue taught to ouer-looke the Woods. Io Hymen Hymenæus. Behold how Vesper from the skie Consenteth by his twinckling eye; And Cynthia stayes her Swans to see The state of this Solemnitie. Io Hymen Hymenæus. Wedlocke, were it not for thee, VVee could nor Childe nor Parent see, Armies Countries to defend, Or Shepheards hilly Heards to tend. Io Hymen Hymenæus. But Hymen call the Nymph away, With Torches light the Children stay, Whose sparkes (see how) ascend on hye, As if there wanted Starres in Skye. Io Hymen Hymenæus. As virgin Vine her Elme doth wed, His Oake the luie ouer-spread: So chaste desires thou ioynst in one, That disvnited were vndone. Io Hymen Hymenæus. But see her golden foote hath past The doubted The Bride neuer vsed to touch the threshold (which custome is yet obserued in some places of Italy) but very warily passed ouer the same, least charmes of some other kinde of Watch-craft might be laid vnder the same, eyther to cause debate, or to the hinderance of procreation. By the Threshold, at her comming home, was set fire and water, which shee touched with eyther hand. Threshold, and at last Shee doth approach her Bridall-bed, Of none saue Tyber enuyed. Io Hymen Hymenæus. Chast Mariage-bed, he sooner tels The Starres, the Ocean Sand, or shels, That thinkes to number those delights Wherewith thou shortnest longest nights. Io, &amp;c. With richest Tyrian Purple spred, Where her deare Spouse is laid on bed, Like yong Ascanius, or the Lad Her Loue the Queene of Cyprus had: Io, &amp;c.

Scatter Nuts at their going to bed were woont to be throwne among children &amp; those without the dote; in token (as Scatiger saith) of renouncing the delights of youth and childhood, and vndertaking the weighty charge of houshold affaires. Diuers other opinions the auncient writers haue had hereof. Nuts without the Dore, The Married is a Childe no more, For whosoere a wife hath wed, Hath other businesse in his head. Io Hymen Hymenæus. Where passe ye many an happy night, Vntill Lucina brings to light; An hopefull Prince who may restore, In part, the losse we had before, Io Hymen Hymenæus. That one day we may liue to see, A Frederick Henry on her knee, Who mought to Europe giue her law, And keepe encroaching Hell in awe. Io, &amp;c. Vpon whose Brow may Enuie read, The reconcile of Loue and Dread, And in whose Rosie cheeke we see, His Mothers gracefull Modestie, Io, &amp;c. But Muse of mine we but molest I doubt, with ruder song their rest, The Dores are shut, and lights about Extinct, then time thy flame were out. Io Hymen Hymenæus. 4. Th' Idalian Boy no sooner with his Fire, Had warm'd the brest of Honour'd Casimire: (That now he leaues the Nimphes along his Rheine, T'espouse Eliza, with Saint Valentine.) But smiling at the Newes, away he hide To Cyprus, where his Mother did abide. There is a Mount within this sacred Ile, Right opposite against seauen-headed Nile, Another way affronting Pharos bright, That many a mile, the Sea-man lends her light: Here on a plaine, to mortall wight vnknowne, Where neuer storme, or bitter blast had blowne; Or candid hoare-Frost show'd the crusty earth; But euer May of meriment and mirth. An hedge the same enuirons all of Gold, Which Mulciber, for sweet embracements sold And wanton dalliance, to the Cipryan Dame; (Tis said) and since she hath possest the same. VVhere still the fields with veluet-greene are spred, And blossomes paint the woods all white and red, No Bird may perch her on the tender bow But such for voyce as Venus shall allow. The trees themselues doe fall in loue with either, As seemes by kissing of their tops together: And softly whispring; when some gentle gale Chides from the Mountaine, through the shady Vale. Now from a Rocke within, two fountaines fall, One sweet, the other, bitter as the gall, Herein doth Cupid often steepe his darts, VVhen his dispos'd to seuer louing harts. A thousand Amorets about doe play (Borne of the Nymphes) these onely wound, they say, The common people, Venus darling hee, Aimes at the Gods, and awfull Maiestie: And many a Power else in this place is found, As Licence, euer hating to be bound, Wrath, easie to be reconcil'd and Teares, Slie Theft, and Pleasure, pale, and iocund Feares: And ouer-head doe flutter in the bowes VVith painted wings, Lyes, Periuries and Vowes. Hence Age is banish'd. Here is seene besides The Goddesse Court, where alway she resides, This Lemnius built of Gold and rarest lemmes, That like a Mount quite hid with Diadems It seemes; where Art and Cost with each contend, For which the Eye, the Frame should most commend. Here Cupid downe with weary wing did light, And iocund comes into his Mothers sight, VVith statefull gate: who from a burnish'd Throne, Embraces, with Ambrosian Armes, her Sonne; And thus begins; the newes my louely Boy, And cause of thy arriue, and this new ioy? Hast thou againe turn'd Ioue into a Cow? Or wanton Daphne to a Lawrell-bough? VVhat Man, or Power immortall, by thy Dart, Is falne to ground, that thus reuiu'd thou art? VVith many a Nectar kisse, milde Loue replies, Our Bow ne'er bare away a greater prize: Knowes not the Goddesse by the fertile Rheine, Young Fredericke, borne of Imperiall Ligne, Descended from that braue A most valiant Souldier, and Nephevv to Charlemaine Rolando slaine, And worlds great VVorthy, valiant Pipin King of France, the Father of Charolus Martellus, he begat Pipin the Father of Charlemaigne, auncetour to Count Frederick: Charle-Maigne. This hopefull Impe is stricken with our Bowe, VVee haue his Armes, and three-fold Shield to show; Whose ancient Armes vvas the Lyon, vvhich the Hollanders beare, as descended from the auncient Franci. Franconias Lyon, and this of Otto the Sonne of Iewes Duke of Bauaria, or rather Bovaria, marryed Agnes Daughter and Heire of Henry, Count Palatine of the Rhine in the yeere 1215. Baueir, A potent Heyre deriu'd from Cassimeir. Another The third and middlemost, borne by the Palatine Argent onely, long they bore, Till charg'd by Charles the last, late Emperour, That as Arch-Sewer, and Elector, this Hee beares, saue honor, adding nought of his. What Coast or Country haue not heard their Fame? Or who not lou'd their euer honour'd Name? Yet trembled at from farthest Castian Sea, And Scythian Tanais, to the Danubie. Eliza's Name, I know, is not vnknowne Vnto my Queene, the second vnto none, For beauty, shape of Body, euery grace, That may in earthly Maiestie take place; That were not Venus daily seene of mee, I would haue sworne this Princesse had beene shee. Hast Cytherea, Leaue thy natiue Land, And ioyne them quickly by the Marriage band. The Queene her Sonne remouing from her lap, Her haire of wiery gold shee tresseth vp. Throwes on her Veile, and takes the Girdle chaste, Wherewith she quiets stormes, and euery blast, Allaies the swelling flouds, and furious sea; Whereto full speedily she takes her way: And here arriu'd, sends forth a Cupid faire, Drest like a Sea-Nymph, with a siluer hayre: To search the deepe, and bring vnto the shore Some Triton, able to conuay her o'er; Which if hee did performe with nimble speede, A golden Bowe and Shafts should be his meede. No sooner Loue had diu'd into the Maine, But on the surge appear'd a wondrous traine Of Sea-gods, Tritons, Nymphes, who equall stroue The formost who should aide the Queene of Loue; First, Neptune, mounted on a A Fish almost as bigge as the Whale. Grampas crown'd With Roses, calm'd the Ocean all around: Palæmon on a Seale with hoary lockes, Begirt with Samphire from the neighbour rockes: An vgly VVhirlepoole Nereus bestrides, VVith Trident galling oft his lazie sides. Among the Maids she Glaucus hindmost lagges Vpon a Porpose brideled with flagges. Next Venus comes, with all her beauteous crew, VVhom Dolphins in a shelly Chariot drew. No Nymph was there but did some gift bestow, That did in Amphitrites bosome grow: Cymothoe brought a girdle passing faire Of siluer, twisted with her Christall haire. Young Spathale, a pearely Carcanet, And Clotho Corrall, good as she could get. Faire Galatea from the Persian Shore, Strange Iemmes and Flowers, some vnknowne before, Which to Eliza, as their loues they sent, (Herewith adorning Venus as she went) Whom when they had conducted to our Thame, And view'd the spatious channell of the same, Admir'd our Chalkie Cliffes, suruai'd each Pierre, Our fertile Shores, our Ships, and Harbours here, They backe vnto their boundlesse home doe hye; But in a cloud the Queene ascends the skie, And takes her way vnto the Royall Hall, Where downe, she did no sooner softly fall, But Clouds were fled that ouer cast the ayre, And Phœbus threw about his golden hayre: Eke Snow-tress'd Ianuary (seldome seene) Vpon his brow had got a wreath of greene. Ioy was in Court, and iocund mirth possest The hearts of all, from greatest to the least, (Yet knew they not the cause) the windowes lay Bestrow'd with Primrose, Violets, and Bay. Now children looke (quoth shee) you banish hence Affaires of State, ambitious difference, Complaints, and Faction, melancholy Feares, All Parsimonie, sighes, and former Teares. Let Nights in royall banquetting be spent, Sweet Musicke, Masques, and ioyous merriment. Now pleasure take her fill; bring Graces Flowers; With Torches Hymen plant the lofty Towers; Twine, Concord double Girlonds, Cupids you Some gather branches from the Myrtle bough. And guild the roofe with waxen lights on high; Tacke (others) vp rich Arras busily; Some cast about sweet waters; others clense With Myrrhe, and best Sabæan Frankinsence, The Curtaines; others fit about her Bed, Or for her foote the floore with Veluet spred. VVhich said, into the Chamber of the Bride, VVho lay to rest, she passed vnespide And secretly instructs her how to loue, Recounting euery pleasure shee should proue: And vrgeth that each Creature's borne to be The Propagator of Posteritie. And now and then, shee casteth in betweene, Their Legends that haue faithfull Louers beene: Shee tels of Dido, and Lucretia chaste, Camilla, Hero, Thisbe, and the rest, And many a Booke shee had at fingers end, VVhich for her purpose oft shee can commend. Now as the Aire gan more and more to cleare, The Goddesse plainly did at last appeare. VVhose burnish'd haire the goodly roome did guild, And with a sweet Ambrosian odor fill'd, That seeing now Eliza's goodly grace, Her daintie fingers, and her fairest face: Shee stood amazed, and with a Nectar kisse, Shee bow'd her selfe, and boldly vtter'd this. All happinesse vnto the Princesse be, The Pearle and Mirrour of great Brittannie, For whose deere sake, I this aduenture tooke, And Paphos with my Cyprus sweet forsooke: Drawne by the Rumor of thy Princely Name, And pitty of the hopefull Frederickes flame, Though thou wert not a Princesse by thy birth, This face deserues the greatest King on Earth, What hand so fits a Scepter, and what Eye, Did euer sparke with sweeter Maiestie, Thy lips the Roses, whitest necke excells The mountaine snow, and what is whiter els. VVith equall temper how the white and red, (Our cullors,) are vpon thy cheeke dispred, The fingers of the Morning doe not shine, More pleasing then those beauteous ones of thine, If Bacchus crown'd his Loue with many a starre, VVhy art thou yet vncrowned, fairer farre? Oh Virgin, worthy onely not of Rhine, And that sweet soile, thy Countie Palatine, (Where Mose, the Moene, the Nah, and Nicer clear, With Nectar runne against thy comming there) But of a world, due to those guiftes of thine, Which to thee more then all thy Iewels shine, This said; about her Iuory necke she hung, The Nereids tokens which she brought along, And with a needle curl'd her louely haire, Then Gallant Pearles bestow'd at either eare, And ore her head she threw her Sindon vaile, That farre adowne (vpborne by Nimphes) did traile, By this, without a thousand Virgins stai'd, To lead along to Church the Princely maid, With heauenly sounds, (in fall of plenteous showers, Among the crew, of all the sweetest flowers.) That Cytharea leaues the Virgin now, And takes her leaue with this, or other vow. Liue Roiall Paire in peace and sweetest Loue, With all aboundance blest by heauen aboue, A thousand kisses binde your harts together, Your Armes be weary with embracing either, And let me liue to see betweene you twaine, A Cæsar borne as great as Charlemaine.
