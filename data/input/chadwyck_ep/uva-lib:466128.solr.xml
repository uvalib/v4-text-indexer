      <field name="fulltext">Dedicated to Mrs Hawksley Burbury, OF UPPER PHILLIMORE GARDENS, KENSINGTON. I knew a maid with fairy dower Of girlish grace; Once seen, you could not quench the power Of that sweet face: Another with a wand and scroll Of woman's tact; She never grieved a human soul By word or act: A third, who wore a diadem Of sympathy; You could not touch her garment's hem Without reply: And last a wife, whose plea of pleas I never knew; Yet She had all their witcheries, And she was You. Kensington, December 6th, 1885. THE WATCH TOWER. Two children who stood on a windy tower, And counted the swallows that darted by! Two lovers who stood at a later hour, Alone with the sea and the stars and sky, And made the grim tower a true lovers' bower, When nought but night was nigh! “You have not forgotten?” one lover said, “How I gazed from our cliff at the seas afar, And fancied that fortune and I were wed If once I could voyage outside the bar; The swallows were darting around your head, As darting still they are. “Ah then I could pine in my ancient home, Bewitched with wild visions of wondrous isles, And long for long days with the sky and foam, And fret at your simple and loving wiles: I would give worlds now could I cease to roam, And linger in your smiles.” A maiden who stood on the same old tower, Unheeding the swallows that darted by, But dreaming a dream of that happier hour, With gleams of a tear in her wistful eye, And drooping her head like a summer flower When autumn days are nigh! The breeze as he moaned through the lattices Caught a waif that strayed from her shining hair, And floated it off for a love of his To sleep on the lap of the sunset air, While she breathed to her sailor-love's lock a kiss And a sigh to her care. He winged back the roses that grew on her face, (The wind, not the lover, alas to say,) And ransomed from exile her rare old grace, That sorrow had stolen and caged away, Till she shone like herself for a full hour's space, Herself of a vanished day. For now he was bending a sail to shore, Till hopes would arise, and a heart would beat With promise of parting for nevermore From him whom she trusted so soon to meet: But the ship, while she gazed at it, tacked and bore To sea with straining sheet. The sail in the swelling horizon sank, The breeze died away in a calm at night, And bosom and cheek on the maiden shrank, As ship after ship would heave into sight, And anchor and weigh and stand for the bank At the mouth of the bight. Until of a morn on the windy tower The breeze caught the waifs of bright hair no more: She had sighed and sorrowed for that dead hour Till her season for sorrows and sighs was o'er; But the swallows still darted around her bower As they darted of yore. THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER. Grouse shooting's grand in August: for the first of fair September, Pleasant it was to wend his way back to familiar Kent, To shoot through fields and hop-gardens in which he could remember Each rise and dip, and gap and gate, that met him as he went. In that 12-acre paddock there he brought down his first partridge, Before the season, 'mid the hoots of reapers looking on; And his grandfather on that knoll fired off his latest cartridge, The day that his long pilgrimage of eighty years was done. That's the first gate he ever took upon the old grey pony; To that oak copse his father oft to meet his mother crept, And down the road that rounds the hill he drove with just one crony, To marry her at Harbledown, while all the “big house” slept. There stands the hall where he was born, with chimney-stacks and gables In the Elizabethan style, and crown-glass window-panes, And with a courtyard built all round with outhouses and stables, Of old red brick, suffused with brown by sun and weather stains. He longs to go back home and have a walk with the old keeper, Who taught him how to hold a gun, and set up the goshawk, That was his earliest trophy—shot just where the edge grows steeper, And hangs above the Roman road, a crumbling cliff of chalk. He longs to go back home and have a shoot with his old neighbours, With those who'd shared his holidays, since holidays he had, And were his mates and rivals in all country sports and labours Upon the ancient manor, ever since he was a lad. And he'd love a stiff day's walking, and his father to dispute his Supremacy with bird for bird from dawn to fall of night, In undulating plough-fields, where the speckled little beauties Might rise from any rise one topped, a dozen at a flight; Or to work a field of turnips with his favourite Gordon setter, Unheedful of the dew that lies in Autumn on the “Roots,” Until a shiver told him that he'd “had a thorough wetter,” Above, and in between, and through his gaiters and his boots; And to see his cousin Maggie, looking most divinely pretty, With her blush and smile of welcome and her gauzy dinner-dress, The feathered quarry finger with a tender touch of pity, To alloy her exultation, and enhance her loveliness. Her cheeks had not the rose, her hair was russet and not golden, Her eyes if blue at all, were not “hall-marked” in their sky hue; Yet needed it no lover's eye the viewer to embolden, To match her with the wearers of the gold and of the blue. THE YELLOW SANDS OF SUSSEX. They stood upon the yellow sands— An old man and a brown-eyed maid— And said, “'Twas here his childish hands With little wooden pail and spade Worked bravely at the grand designs That filled his childhood's fertile brain, Castles and towers and rampart-lines, Which crumbled when the sea again Came rolling in with jealous wave, And through their bastions sapped and clave.” They talk upon the yellow sands— The maiden and the grey-haired man— Of one who now no longer stands Where he his childhood's hopes began. They say, “The little hands, that then Were busy with the wooden spade, Are far away and with the pen The fertile brain its towers has made,” And wonder if, where now he stands, He muses on these yellow sands. Far off—on shores Australian— He stands, of whom these words they said, The first son of the grey-haired man, The brother of the brown-eyed maid; And, when not busy with his pen, And with no voices in his ears, He often bends his thoughts again Unto those dear old childish years, When he upon that distant strand Was playing with the yellow sand. The grey-haired man had locks as brown As are the brown-eyed maid's to-day; The brown-eyed maid—in baby gown, Was hardly old enough to play, When he, the brother and the son,— A child—was playing on the shore Beneath the light of eyes now gone; And yet it seemed as if no more Of months than there were years had passed, Since he and they had stood there last. Far off, upon Australian sands, A fair-haired boy they've never seen, With wooden spade in childish hands, Like that which in his sire's had been, Is shaping out some grand designs, Known only to his childish brain, But strangely-like the towered lines Which, once, beyond the northern main, His Father used with childish hands To rear upon the yellow sands. It may perchance some afterday Fall out that on these Austral sands, I shall point out some spot and say, “'Twas here his little childish hands Worked bravely at the vast designs, That filled his childhood's active brain,” When the fair boy has sought the pines, Which wave beyond the northern main, And the world's sand shall show impress Of his maturer activeness. These two thus talking on the sands, The old man and the brown-eyed maid, Proudly, regretfully of hands Which here in their glad childhood played, Are they not types of half our life? Upon the seashore of the mind We stand, reviewing time-scapes rife With memories long left behind, Of those, who from our sight are lost Beyond the sea, by Dead-folk crossed. Are not the castles on the sands A type of hopes and aims sublime, Which youth, so sanguine of his hands, Would build upon the sands of time? Are not the waves, which, rolling on, Have levelled all the child began, A type of the oblivion Which overwhelms all works of man That are not set up high and dry Above the tide, impregnably? Adieu, upon the yellow sands, O greyhaired man and brown-eyed maid, Gone there to talk of childish hands Which plied a busy wooden spade! Adieu, upon the yellow sands, O maiden and O greyhaired man! Be sure of this, that he, who stands Upon far shores Australian, Makes oft a spirit pilgrimage To haunts he loved in childhood's age. TILBURY FORT GATEWAY. Old gateway, brooding over Thames's water, Thou wakest a proud thrilling of romance In every Englishman, who stays to glance Remembering that here the Tudors' daughter, With all the flower of London to escort her, Halted to bar the Spaniard's advance, And calling up the fame and puissance Of the Round Table of sea-knights, who brought her To splendour worthy of a Fairy Queen, And him who hailed her such, and him who drew The fifth King Harry in his battle scene. But we regard thee with a tenderer view, Who stepped aboard beneath thine ancient guns For the new England under southern suns. A BIRTHDAY LETTER FROM AUSTRALIA. In other days I loved to see the smile upon your face, To hear the laugh of girlish glee and note the kindly grace Which welcomed with sincere delight each birthday offering, Alike the jewel, and the mite which Poverty could bring. To-day, beneath a southern sun, I dream of what has been, Of dear old days that now are done, and each familiar scene; Of tea upon the garden seat beside the leafy limes, And voices sweet that used to greet my ears in other times. To-day between us roll and heave five thousand leagues of foam, Yet 'tis not easy to believe that I am far from home; For the same friendly English speech salutes the wanderer's ear, And English hearts and hopes can reach this southern hemisphere. Good-bye, dear sister! you shall be remember'd well to-night, We'll drink your health with three times three in champagne beakers bright: Thus ev'ry year, till by and by I meet you all once more 'Neath the familiar northern sky and on our mother shore. A WEDDING LETTER FROM AUSTRALIA. Dear Mary, I can picture you—the grey, familiar aisle— The veiling lace of spotless hue—the shy, delightful smile— The new emotion, just awake—the sight with dew-drops dim— The trembling promise to forsake the world to follow him. Sweet be your hours of wedded life, such hours as had our queen, Or Eleanor the loyal wife, who foiled the Saracene, Sweet summer be your wedding day, and summer be your years, And cloud and tempest be away from both their atmospheres. Fair be your branches, straight of stem, and laden with ripe fruit, And may new branches spring from them to keep the ancient root From lying hidden in the earth, its very site unknown, Like millions of forgotten worth in every age and zone. And now, good night, for night has come to us in Austral climes, Although the noonday sun at home still shines above the limes: To-night it is your wedding morn, and on your wedding night, Here, half-way 'twixt Good Hope and Horn, all will be morning bright. THE MARINER'S COMPASS. My heart is like the needle Which points for ever north, No matter where it's sailing, From end to end of earth: As polestar rules the compass, As lodestone sways the steel, There is a home in England Whose magnet-power I feel. And there my heart points ever On cloudy days and fair, When winds are blowing gently, Or squalls are in the air: And in the merry future I'll trim my sails by it, And homeward-bound, North-westwards, Across the billows flit. A POETRY OF EXILES. A poetry of Exiles—we are exiles From the heirlooms and cradle of our race, Its hallowed scenes of trials and of triumphs, Its battlefields, its castles and its graves. We cannot go to some thatch-roofed farm-house Or garret in a ruin overhanging The High Street of a mediæval town, And say “'twas here that first his eyes saw light Who won the famous victory,” or pause, With head uncovered, by the battered tomb Of one who gave a nation liberty. We cannot worship in a village church With walls declaring how our ancestors Of generations died and were beloved. We cannot stand in our old halls and say Here all my sires for centuries have stood. Ah no! a world of ocean shuts us off From each association that we prize, Our boasts, our yearnings and our history, Are bound up in the land we left behind; We to the end are Men of Kent and Scots, North countrymen, West countrymen and Irish, Begotten in the Colonies indeed, But bearing in our speech and our traditions And prejudice the stamp of the old home. But then if we are exiles, we are free, The clouds, the chill, the tempest left behind, For warmth and clear blue skies and calm blue seas. We, who were cooped up by competing crowds In ever narrowing strips of the old land, Can push out into distance unsurveyed: And we who lived amid the smoke of cities Can ramble into virgin forest-glades, Where crimson tulips and rock-lilies blow Surpassing in their span and brilliance The monarchs of the garden, and each tree And shrub and thicket glows with wealth of bloom As beautiful and fragrant as the flowers Which only grow down on the ground in fields And woods of England. Each can have a home And freehold of his own, and no close phalanx Of sons of Norman knights and Saxon thegns Confronts the artizan and labourer When he aspires to climb into command. But wherewith shall we strike a resonant string Upon the exile's lyre?—what note of pride, Of ecstasy, of horror, of regret? We have no history, no battlefields, No shattered castles, no debateable And ballad-crowded border; no romance Of courtly birth, no storied Westminster; But we have our own heroes, men who dared The unknown perils of the wilderness To make the land we live in known to us, And died by nameless deaths. And we have chasms Paved with primeval forests and with ramparts Dwarfing to ant-heaps human fortresses. And we have sunny days and cloudless skies In long procession: harbours fairy green And forest flowery from topmost tree Down to the tiny creek that drains the dell. Our battlesongs must be of exploration, Our idylls of Bush-flowers and the wives Who are the flowers of our exiled life: Our metaphors of awe and the sublime Must paint the fell and forest, and our rhythm Must gallop o'er illimitable plains, Or listen to the swaying of the trees Couched by campfires at night, when day-sounds sleep: The majesty of space and solitude Must kindle wonder, and the undimmed blue Of southern skies breathe airiness and grace. But ever through our measures let there run An echo of old voices, a reflex Of unforgotten scenes, a waft of flowers Which grow on English banks and Scottish braes Or round the stillness of an Irish lake, To show that on the far Pacific isle The blood flows uncorrupted in our veins. QUIS SEPARABIT. (An answer to those who consider Colonial Independence desirable.) Why separate? I would that we were one— Not we, and she, and Canada, alone, But our lost brothers of the Union. Union is strength—union is statescraft, too; And what are we, if England be not with us, But a few traders fringing the sea-coast Of a huge half-discovered continent— A few backwoodsmen pushing out our bounds A forced-march further in the wilderness Through peril and starvation, year by year. We have a noble future, but not yet Have we emerged from childhood, and our bones And sinews are not set to manhood's mould; We are not old enough to leave our home And launch out into life, like grown-up men; We could not, by ourselves, maintain the strife In war, with a great nation, disciplined And hardened in a thousand years of battles; We are the pickets of an army sent To pioneer and keep a steady watch Against advancing foes—a vanguard sent To carry a position, and hold out Until the reinforcements can come up. We have done yeoman's service for the State; But is it wise to call for separation From the main force, and constitute ourselves An independent corps, because no foe Has fronted us, no lurid cloud of war Darkened our fair horizon? While we cling To our great mother we are sons and heirs To all the heroes in her Abbey laid; Our fathers fought at Creçy, Agincourt, Blenheim, Quebec, Trafalgar, Waterloo; Shakspeare's and Bacon's countrymen are we, Newton's disciples, friends of Walter Scott, Fellow-inventors of Watt, Stephenson, Arkwright, Sir Humphrey Davy, and Wheatstone, Fellow discoverers of Drake and Cook, Brothers-in-arms of Wellington and Nelson, Successors to the Lords of Runnymede, Assigns of the Petitioners of Right, Executors of England's Constitution, Joint-tenants of the commerce of the world, Joint-owners of the Empire upon which The sun sets never, co-heirs of the Fame Built up by valour, learning, statesmanship, Integrity, endurance, and devotion, On land and sea, in fierce and frozen climes, Through eight blood-stained and glorious centuries. Divide us, and we sink at once to bourgeois, Received in the society of nations For our new wealth, but laughed at secretly By the proud governments of ancient blood, Who ever wear their rapiers at their sides To draw for fancied insults—while poor we, Like good plain tradesmen, have to put our pride Into our pocket, and, when one cheek's struck, Present the other meekly to the smiter. But while we live as children in the household Of the Great Empire, let them but insult Her honour in the poorest artizan Who labours in our streets, and there will follow Swift vengeance, borne along in serried ranks Of veterans, or wafted over seas In her triumphant navy's iron fleets. Dear land of my adoption, sever not The right hand from thy parent, nor despoil Thy mother of her youngest, fairest child, But rather be united in thyself, With all thy members knit in close communion, And strive to draw thy sisters, east and west, More closely round her till, in after years, The children—older, wiser, mightier— Shall be found worthy to assert their voice Beside their mother, in a Parliament Replete from every corner of the realm. AN AUSTRALIAN EPODE. “Beatus ille qui procul negotiis,” etc. How happy he, who, far from Sydney heat And from the noisy, dusty street, Can spend his days in carelessness among The woodland shade and woodland song. How gladly could I pass a peaceful life, Away from city stir and strife, On the Blue Mountains in a little cot, By road and rail not quite forgot, With half a square mile round it, where my mood Could be indulged with clearing wood And laying out an orchard and a plot Of kitchen garden, a still spot With shelter from the gales which eastward blow, And ever-running creek below, Threading its way twixt tangled ferny bowers. I'd leave one half to native flowers, Boronias, lobelias and heaths And lilac-pencilled creamy wreaths Of clematis, with myriad bells around The stems and crowns of saplings wound. I'd never cut the royal Waratah But leave each crimson glowing star To shine, a glory, through the ambient bush, Or open in its peerless flush The monarch of a flower-bed supreme, The blossom of an eastern dream. Here I'd watch Nature in her housewife sphere Of daily duties through the year, In winter making earth's parched surface cool And filling creek and tank and pool, In spring releasing budding leaves and flowers, Imprisoned through the wintry hours And in the fiercest of the summer heat, In summer filling fruits with sweet And bringing glittering days and clear fresh nights, Fair as the “Father of the Lights” Has deigned in any age, in any clime Since earth was in her Eden-prime, And in the autumn shedding eves of rest For heads with summer-noons distressed. In winter I would have a noble blaze, A glimpse of summer in dark days,— No stint of fuel where the ground to clear Could fill the hearths for many a year. Felling majestic logs would give me health As well as save a mint of wealth In coal unpurchased. Great men oft have found A fount of youth in clearing ground: Gladstone in England; our most learned men Have wielded axe as well as pen. The fallen stringy-bark would give the slab To roof the wattle and the dab; The straight, young sapling-trees would build the frame, And make the fence to bound my claim; The best and handiest of trunk and root My fuel-hoard would constitute; The giant stumps too massive to out-grub I'd burn on windy days with scrub Too poor to stack. Felling and firing trees Would be my winter cure for ease, When not employed in breaking up field soil To fit it for its annual toil, Or hoeing up the weeds between the lines Of lemons, oranges, and vines. And when the swift night of the winter came, Beside a homely oil-lamp flame I'd dip into the hoard of books I've ta'en In all my flights o'er land and main. To take up one would mind me of the home I left beyond the northern foam, With its bright plate and ancient portraits hung The spacious dining-room along. Round sisters fair and father good and dear Enjoying dainty English cheer, Almost in earshot of the classic bells, Whose ring the infant cockney tells; Another would recall the famous school Where I was ruled and taught to rule, As captain of it: this, with notes and signs On margins and between the lines, Would conjure up an image of grey walls And Oxford's memorable halls, And the conflicting tides of college days, The hopes of academic praise With the temptations to let fair days slip In bright ease and boon fellowship; And that so daintily preserved might tell Of some fair girl whom I loved well, Or whom I pleased in the old land, wherein It was my proud fate to begin. And all this pageant might unfold its state In a small room some twelve by eight Of bark hut or of weatherboarded cot In a secluded mountain spot Five thousand leagues from where I “took my gown,” The Oxford expression for taking one's degree. And fifty odd from Sydney town. In spring I'd keep the untaxed wood-fires on Till my full meed of sun-fire shone, And, out of doors, I'd spend my morning hours In regist'ring the births of flowers. I'd make a calendar and mark each day Not in the antiquated way But with the opening buds. The prickly heath, The first to leave its wintry sheath, And each unfolding star that followed it, Should on my watchful page be writ. I'd listen to the brown bee's lulling speech From the pink promise of the peach And pluck the golden oranges which hung Their incense-snow of bloom among, And in the southern noontide's solemn hush I'd take my book into the bush And watch the operations of the spring, The wrens their nestlings fostering, The lizards darting out again to greet The advent of their favourite heat, A stray snake here and there half-numbed and slow In the well-nigh forgotten glow, And insects coming back to haunt the shade Wherein their race last summer played, The flickering shade of chequered light and dark, Of Austral forest depths the mark. For the thin gum-leaves with their mournful droop And stiff mimosas loath to stoop, Cannot block out the puissant southern sun As oak and ash and beech have done In many an unforgotten Kentish glade, Wherein in childhood's days we played. In summer I would leave my bed betimes To have the mornings in their primes For gathering the ripened English fruits From trees and plants with bloom and roots, These guarded from the frost, those duly fed,— From cherry-croft and strawberry-bed, Currant and gooseberry garden, all in vain Implanted on the sultry plain. And when the sun attained his noonday crown I'd on an easy bank lie down And revel in contrasted hues divine, The sky blue on the sombre line Of dark-green forest round the mountain top, With here and there a grey outcrop Of bald defiant rock: and when the eve The heaven and earth should interweave In web of golden fire, I'd stand upon A gorge's summit, looking on The shadow cast by intervening hill Upon the treetops, sleeping still Down in its heart a thousand feet below, Where man's foot might not ever go, And then retrace my steps once more to give My garden wherewithal to live— The water whereof Heav'n so great a need, So little store has us decreed. A hearty meal should close the day, and night Should soon lend slumber and delight. When autumn followed, I should feel at first A throb of exultation burst At its fresh morns, but I should mind me soon That autumn was the afternoon, That winter's night, and spring's awakening dawn, Even when autumn was withdrawn, Must intervene, ere in full grace the morn The mount and forest could adorn, Although in this inimitable land, Even the winter skies were bland. I'd spend the autumn noons in calling back From the loath summer's downward track Gleams of his glory, and when autumn's night Swooped down more swiftly on the light Once more, I'd lit my lamp, and bring my books At dusk from their accustomed nooks. Here I'd cast off ambition and the cares Of making fortunes, with their snares, Forget each eager longing of my life, Forget each triumph, trial, strife, Forget the toils of boyhood and of youth, For crowns scholastic, and in sooth Censure and praise and social days forget, With each attendant joy and fret, Content an uneventful life to lead, With nought but health and peace for meed. A man who has a cot, though small it be, From rent and tax and mortgage free, With half a mile of freehold round it, where He can take exercise and air, With trees to cut for fire, and fence, and shed, And orchard, flower- and cabbage-bed, And old book friends and stranger books within, When rain or nightfall drives him in, And just enough of yearly income clear To let him drink his English beer, Careless of cost as oft as he may please, Should be a very prince-at-ease, And doubly prince if he can have his cot Upon some lovely mountain spot, With view of forest, fall and precipice, To dazzle and delight his eyes, And on vine, shrub and tree, a wealth of flowers, Wondrous and wild in springtide hours, And trebly if he have with cot and land And vista flowery and grand, A fair girl in her womanhood's fresh spring, With something of the flowering, And something of the lofty mountain side Of Nature in herself allied, To share and to illuminate his life, As sweetheart ne'er discrowned and wife, A girl whose elegance and pleading face And the refinement of whose grace Will guard him from neglecting, while they roam, The gentle habits of a home; A girl who will not fear to walk or ride Long journeys at her husband's side, Or, if need be, to spend a long lone day, When business summons him away, And one whose approbation sweet will lend The palm to every labour's end. But human nature 's human nature still, Just one joy more his cup would fill That on his little freehold near the spot Where he has reared his rustic cot, Rich seams of coal should near the surface lie, That he might “float a company” And have the means, whenever he was fain, Of living in the town again 'Mid every luxury that wealth and art Could add to gratify his heart. PARRAMATTA OAK-WALK. Over my head the oak branches are sighing, Out of yon lodge I hear English speech, Under my feet the dead oak leaves are lying, Rustling like shingle on Sussex beach. Well could I fancy myself in old England Were it not May and the leaves not red, For May goes not thither till promised a spring land, And May comes not hither till leaves are dead; And over my head in the violet heaven, Lustrous as never are English skies, Shone not the Cross of the South for the Seven Dear in the north to my childish eyes; And on the hill did the gum-trees not shiver, Flapping their vesture of tattered bark, Emblems of desolate indigence ever Winter and summer, by day and dark. Oaks make not England; the oak-tree is rooted Wherever an Englishman's foot may rest, And the speech and the customs of England are bruited From the swart south-east to the wild north-west. ADELAIDE. Two miles out from the Semaphore the ship at anchor lies, Steam up, about to bid adieu to our dear native skies. Till now her flight has skimmed the shore, but when she wings to-night, Her path is o'er the open sea across the Austral Bight. It was not until Adelaide was sinking out of view That all the lonely bitterness of leaving home we knew, But, when the last Australian port was fading on our lee, Then! not till then, we realised that we were out at sea. Adieu, dear native skies, adieu! we may not hope to see Earth's other skies as mild and bright, where'er on earth we be. Adieu, dear native land! adieu, home of our childhood's joy, And home of freedom, peace and mirth, without the base alloy Of want and sin that poverty and crowded millions bring To the beloved and puissant isle from which we boast to spring, Our home, where none need be too poor to have his cot and field And where the man, who tills the land, reaps what the land may yield. Fare you well, Adelaide, farewell! Just as we leave your shore Hundreds are floating to your quays to share the bounteous store You offer every willing hand, which breaks your fertile soil,— A proper palm for honesty and certain crown for toil. LONGFELLOW IS DEAD. (Written in Australia, the day that the news of his death was telegraphed.) A voice was wafted o'er the seas, which said That Longfellow was dead; And straightway from three continents arose Such hum of many woes As rises from the nations when their great Have bowed the head to fate. This is the man who, born American, Was yet an Englishman, And gloried in the oneness of our race, Though severed by the space Of all the ocean highways of the world. To-day should be unfurled By all of English speech, drooped half-mast high, The flag he loved to eye, Charged with the Stars and Stripes: he was as dear To men at home and here As in the great Republic—all his song To England doth belong, As much as Milton's: for there were two sides Beyond Atlantic tides, As there were in the great Rebellion. And what if he took one And we the other? 'tis no more than when One bard cursed the King's men, And others satirized the Parliament. This soothsayer was sent With magic words to charm away the scars Left by the great old wars Our fathers fought in fratricidal strife; And through his active life Was fusing back the pieces into one Pan-Anglic Union. He used to boast that we were one in days When Shakespeare wrote his plays; And we can boast that in these latter hours All his own songs are ours. We claim as ours the “Old Clock on the Stair,” And the “Two Locks of Hair.” “God's acre,” and the “Voices of the Night,” And “Psalm of Life” delight The dwellers in the old home in the North, And those whom she sent forth To make an England here. The “April Day,” “It is not always May,” “The Reaper and the Flowers,” “The Wayside Inn,” And his “Evangeline,” And “Haunted Houses” are a legacy To all of us who be Of the same tongue, as well as those whose land Bore the magician's hand, That touched these heartstrings. When we two were young, Were not the songs he sung Our sample of all song? As we grew old We failed not to strike gold Where'er we plied our picks. As ages roll, His fame, from pole to pole, Will be as evergreen as it is wide, The while that side by side, As was his wish, the Englands, old and new, Stand forth in all men's view Brothers in blood and history and song, After estrangement long, United by the words he spake to both More firmly than by oath. GOODBYE—A RONDEAU. God be with you—whose golden hair Has been to me a beacon glare Of bright and virtuous womanhood, Graceful and arch as well as good, You who have had your hearty share In each my pleasure, each my care, At home and in the summer air, And only once misunderstood— God be with you! And while I whisper presage fair Of true love floating in the air For you, when comes the woman's mood— The longing to be meetly wooed, I breathe a sigh, and breathe a pray'r, God be with you! IN MEMORIAM, F. M. H.—A SONNET. As when a man who leaves his native shore Finds it grow dimmer as the good ship flees, So he, who long in our Antipodes Sojourns, will find friends' features evermore Eluding recollection, which before Were near as well as dear. But when such die, As on a pitch dark night the traveller's eye, Waked by a flash of lightning-fire, runs o'er The landscape round him—so the memory, Waked by the shock, can call back every trait Of face and person, light on lovingly Each kindly look and gesture of a day Now past for ever, till the shock goes by As darkness closes round the lightning's ray. A WEDDING SONNET. To thee, my brother, on our native shore About to lead thy fancy's chosen bride For coronation at the altar side, I send fair hopes. Thou standest at the door Of manhood's inner chamber, which passed o'er, Are drawn out vistas goodly to the eye Of fatherhood and clear-cheeked infancy, Delightful childhood, youth afire to soar, And useful, noble manhood; and withal Vistas for thee of a long life, well spent, Declining through fair weather to its fall, And with an Indian summer orient, After the autumn winds have spread a pall Of leaves as the first summer's monument. THE TURNED PICTURE. Yes! this is Madeline's bedside: how strange that I am here! We have not changed a dozen words in all the lonely year— She once was sunbeam of the house, the pet and pride of all, Though now her picture hangs at home with face toward the wall. I never quarrelled with her; we were best of friends always: She was my favourite sister from our childhood's happy days; Had it not been for Herb—and yet I love her most, I think, For marrying the man she loved, let the ship swim or sink. The day the door closed on her, when she went her way to wed, It closed on her for ever—in his wrath my father said: Not dreaming as his anger rose, that she'd be lying here, Half through the gate of life and death, and all within the year. Could I forgive him—or myself, if Maggie were to die, Who never dealt me one hard look, one wound in a reply? And yet I lacked the courage, in the hour of her disgrace, To brave his wrath and tell her I was hers, before his face. Still lovely though at war with Death! the fever has not slain The gentle spirit in her eyes; she smiles, in spite of pain, With the old open smile of days when we were one, though twain; O, God! when shall I know the joy of those dead days again? O, Madeline, my own, had I but known what was to be, Think you that sire or sister should have parted you and me! This house has never been the same since it was closed to you, And from my heart I tell you—I have never been untrue. O Madeline, my own, if God should take you from me now, The brand upon the brow of Cain would burn into my brow. Sisterhood is a sacred bond not lightly to be broken Or cast aside, for Father's pride, like a mere lover's token. O Madeline, my own, if God should listen to my pray'r, I will never leave you, never,—as I hope for Heaven, I swear. O Madeline, come back, come back! 'tis I am calling you— Your sister, darling Maggie; in my heart I have been true. ADIEU TO VICTORIA. Adieu, my second home, First caravanserai At which I made long stay Since I began to roam. Others will follow you: Long as I live, I know, Knowledge will bid me go After adventures new Through her broad realms and seas: She will not leave me rest, But spurs me to the quest Of fresh discoveries. Here, in three rapid years, It has been mine to trace The same old Saxon race Building anew the tiers Of the great polity, Of which the first designs, In rude and faint outlines, Were immemorially Known to the free brave men Of Germany, who dwelt In her vast forest belt, Or by the Frisian fen. Where I shall pitch my tent After the next brief stage In my life's pilgrimage, Still bideth the event. Maybe in Hindustan, 'Mid folk whose blood was one With ours in epochs gone On Highlands Aryan, Or neath the clear blue skies That smiled on infant Rome, Or where the waters foam Which saw the bright sunrise Of Athens and the arts, Or where the orange trees Wave gently in the breeze Over stout Moorish hearts. Yet somehow I believe, That, when the wind turned cold Proclaims in accents bold My fast approaching eve, I shall have bent my way Back to the ancient home, Where, ere I learned to roam, So many a happy day Of my glad childhood passed, Where I was born and bred And those, who now have sped, Bade farewell to me last. My manhood left the pine To bask beside the palm, But I would have my psalm Chaunted beneath the sign Of pine-boughs interlaced— The open woodwork roof And “pillars massy—proof” Of some old abbey, based In the dear English earth My child-feet used to tread And which I'd have my bed Of sleep as well as birth. THE TWO BROTHERS. Hoar is the manse 'mid purple heather, Where hardy with the hard grey weather Of breezy Scottish hills, Two gallant boys grew up together, For triumphs or for ills. Bred in the parish-school to knowledge, Sent in their ripening years to college In the old classic towers, Their wild blood forced them to acknowledge That there are inner powers Which bow not to the calculations Of those who tend our educations, But mould us at their will, Our several predestinations In due time to fulfil. Each left those towers without emotion, Each tendered his young life's devotion To that time-honoured hope And refuge of high hearts—the ocean With its prodigious scope. And there they parted, one to mingle With clenched hilt and tight-drawn surcingle In the fierce surge of war, Far from the Highland fireside's ingle, From his boy-brother far, And after to lay down the sabre, And through unheard of risk and labour To wield a soldier's pen, To make grim war his next-door neighbour, And live with dying men, Until all Europe rang the praises, Of him who chronicled the phases, Events, and daily stride Of warfare in a warrior's phrases, And for his work defied The lurking perils of night-watches, And Victory's shell-mangled batches, Like combatants themselves, That every day might bring despatches To every cottar's shelves. The other on the sea went roaming, Until some chance controlled his coming To Queensland's sunny shore, Unconscious that the Powers were dooming That he should leave no more. And here the same fierce blood, which hurried His brother swift and undeterrèd To where the war was waged, Left him no rest till he was buried, As in his veins it raged. Now you could hear his stockwhip rattle, Mustering roving herds of cattle Out on a western run, Now he was fighting a stark battle Under a northern sun With quartz reefs for their golden treasures, Enshrining his wild pains and pleasures In strong pathetic verse, And giving in his rugged measures A picture rich and terse Of miners and their wild existence, Of bush life in the untamed distance, Of shanty-revelry, And of stern struggles for subsistence When creek and run were dry. Ten years had passed since last the tidings Of his migrations and abidings Had reached his far-off friends, When, following the inner guidings Which shape us to our ends, Or by some chance, the elder brother His footsteps turned to where the other Had breathed out his bright life, Without the hand of child or mother To soothe in the last strife. He knew not where to seek, nor even Whether a kind and gracious Heaven Had held a shielding hand Over that head, and it were given To him in this far land To clasp his long-lost brother to him; Nor might he know till those who knew him, The lost one, in old times, Came shyly in to interview him With wild yarns and stray rhymes Of the bush-poet—brother drovers And mining-mates and some few rovers, And Jacks of every trade Like the dead brother, all staunch lovers Of him, who 'neath the shade Of the God's acre trees was lying, Where nightly the hillwinds come sighing Over Toowomba's heights, Where friendly hands received him dying, And tended his faint lights So tenderly. And some wild rover, Stockman, or mining mate or drover, Brought out one day a book, Well-thumbed, with torn green paper cover, And bade the brother look On ill-cut pages ornamented, In type unevenly indented, And lines that were not flush, With stirring rough-hewn poems printed As “Voices from the Bush.” Adieu, staunch mates, who fondly hoarded The memory else unregarded Of him with his wild rhymes, Who nursed, unnamed and unrewarded, His fame till better times! And thou, great, tender, soldier brother, Come from so far to seek the other, Who here breathed out his life Too soon, without a child or mother To soothe in his last strife! FREEDOM. “Of old sat Freedom on the heights;” To-day she devastates the plains; And she who dawned with boreal lights, At eve forked lightnings rains. Misled by wreckers, men decline Towards their fierce primeval state, Forgetting that by discipline The Roman grew so great. Her name hath rung in many a song Of noblest deed and maddest crime, Hath nerved to right and lured to wrong In every age and clime. The Switzers raised their psalm to her Ere they marched down, resolved to fall Rather than brook the foreigner Who thought their hills to thrall, But Petroleuses who pyred the woe The German on their country wrought, Who laid its last-left trophies low, Sang her strains, too—distraught. O Freedom, for six thousand years Hailed in all Babel's scattered tongues, Whose altars reek with blood, whose ears Are deafened by wild lungs, Hast thou, since Earth began her moan For Adam's freeness, in her youth, Once had from spotless hands thine own, Once heard the tones of truth? ENGLAND'S APPEAL TO HER ELECTORS. Steal not our past! Let not the temple, built With hecatombs of patriots, go down In one wild orgy under banners gilt With Freedom's twisted scroll and tinsel crown! Steal not our past! Let not lost India tell That Plassey and Lucknow were all in vain! Let not the Rock, which Elliott held so well In England's darkest hour, fall back to Spain! Steal not our past! The sons of those who fought At Blenheim and Trafalgar, must they yield The gifts a rescued nation gave unsought To those who crowned her name on flood and field? Steal not our past! Hands off the Church who holds Our sires of thirteen centuries asleep Within her aisles and yew-treed, moss-turfed folds, Whose glorious fanes the Art of ages keep! Steal not our past! It should not be a crime That our sires lived not for their little day, But saved as if their seed should out-last time, And worked like men whose name should shine for aye. Steal not our hopes! Estrange not nor disown Our venturous children who have wandered forth To stablish in wild lands of every zone Homes lasting as the old home in the north! PROTESTANT DAY, 1885. (The Anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, of William III.'s landing in Torbay, and the Battle of Inkerman.) Protestant Day—and England's Church in danger! Tory and Liberal beside her stand! Are infidels to plunder Her and change Her— The mother of Church-freedom for our land? Outside Canossa's gate the German shivered, Humbled and impotent amid the snow; And France's mightiest King before It quivered— The Power unbroken till our Church's blow. The mother of Church-freedom, our great charter Of English freedom from the realm of Rome, Sealed with the blood of patriot and martyr, Bound up, from birth to death, with life of Home. Guy Fawkes! Torbay! This fifth day of November Who can forget the Papists' famous plot? Who but our Revolution must remember? Who hath the Seven Bishops' tale forgot? The Church of England! aye—and England's glory! If Inkerman's shall come to us again, 'Twill be through those who love our Church and Story, And not through godless, unremembering men. From royal Westminster whose Abbey gathers The bones of those who built up England's fame, To little country-churches, where our fathers, For centuries, to font and altar came, From where at Canterbury, yet unminished, Stands that same church, in which Augustine preached, To mission-room, in mining-town just finished— A mark how far Truth's last high springtide reached, Ring out wild peals of peril, then the voices Of strong men stern to guard their hearths and homes, With fierce thoughts for the foeman who rejoices That ruin runs behind where'er he roams. Up Peer! Up Peasant! Children of the City, From whose stout hands our English commerce rose, Show them, that if they show your Church no pity, You can be pitiless against Her foes!</field>
