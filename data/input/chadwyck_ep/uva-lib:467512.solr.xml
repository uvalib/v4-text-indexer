      <field name="fulltext">POETRY FOR CHILDREN. ENVY. This rose-tree is not made to bear The violet blue, nor lily fair, Nor the sweet mignonette: And if this tree were discontent, Or wished to change its natural bent, It all in vain would fret. And should it fret, you would suppose It ne'er had seen its own red rose, Nor after gentle shower Had ever smelled its rose's scent, Or it could ne'er be discontent With its own pretty flower. Like such a blind and senseless tree As I've imagined this to be, All envious persons are: With care and culture all may find Some pretty flower in their own mind, Some talent that is rare. THE REAPER'S CHILD. If you go to the field where the reapers now bind The sheaves of ripe corn, there a fine little lass, Only three months of age, by the hedge-row you'll find, Left alone by its mother upon the low grass. While the mother is reaping, the infant is sleeping; Not the basket that holds the provision is less By the hard-working reaper, than this little sleeper, Regarded, till hunger does on the babe press. Then it opens its eyes, and it utters loud cries, Which its hard-working mother afar off will hear; She comes at its calling, she quiets its squalling, And feeds it, and leaves it again without fear. When you were as young as this field-nursëd daughter, You were fed in the house, and brought up on the knee; So tenderly watched, thy fond mother thought her Whole time well bestowed in nursing of thee. THE RIDE. Lately an equipage I overtook, And helped to lift it o'er a narrow brook. No horse it had except one boy, who drew His sister out in it the fields to view. O happy town-bred girl, in fine chaise going For the first time to see the green grass growing. This was the end and purport of the ride I learned, as walking slowly by their side I heard their conversation. Often she— “Brother, is this the country that I see?” The bricks were smoking, and the ground was broke, There were no signs of verdure when she spoke. He, as the well-informed delight in chiding The ignorant, these questions still deriding, To his good judgment modestly she yields; Till, brick-kilns past, they reached the open fields. Then, as with rapturous wonder round she gazes On the green grass, the buttercups, and daisies, “This is the country sure enough,” she cries; “Is't not a charming place?” The boy replies, “We'll go no further.” “No,” says she, “no need; “No finer place than this can be indeed.” I left them gathering flowers, the happiest pair That ever London sent to breathe the fine fresh air. THE BUTTERFLY. SISTER. Do, my dearest brother John, Let that butterfly alone. BROTHER. What harm now do I do? You're always making such a noise— SISTER. O fie, John; none but naughty boys Say such rude words as you. BROTHER. Because you're always speaking sharp: On the same thing you always harp. A bird one may not catch, Nor find a nest, nor angle neither, Nor from the peacock pluck a feather, But you are on the watch To moralize and lecture still. SISTER. And ever lecture, John, I will, When such sad things I hear. But talk not now of what is past; The moments fly away too fast, Though endlessly they seem to last To that poor soul in fear. BROTHER. Well, soon (I say) I'll let it loose; But, sister, you talk like a goose, There's no soul in a fly. SISTER. It has a form and fibres fine, Were tempered by the hand divine Who dwells beyond the sky. Look, brother, you have hurt its wing— And plainly by its fluttering You see it's in distress. Gay painted coxcomb, spangled beau, A butterfly is called, you know, That's always in full dress: The finest gentleman of all Insects he is—he gave a ball, You know the poet wrote. Let's fancy this the very same, And then you'll own you've been to blame To spoil his silken coat. BROTHER. Your dancing, spangled, powdered beau, Look, through the air I've let him go: And now we're friends again. As sure as he is in the air, From this time, Ann, I will take care, And try to be humane. THE PEACH. Mamma gave us a single peach, She shared it among seven; Now you may think that unto each But a small piece was given. Yet though each share was very small, We owned when it was eaten, Being so little for us all Did its fine flavour heighten. The tear was in our parent's eye, It seemed quite out of season; When we asked wherefore she did cry, She thus explained the reason:— “The cause, my children, I may say, Was joy, and not dejection; The peach, which made you all so gay, Gave rise to this reflection: “It's many a mother's lot to share, Seven hungry children viewing, A morsel of the coarsest fare, As I this peach was doing.” CHOOSING A NAME. I have got a new-born sister; I was nigh the first that kissed her. When the nursing woman brought her To papa, his infant daughter, How papa's dear eyes did glisten!— She will shortly be to christen: And papa has made the offer, I shall have the naming of her. Now I wonder what would please her, Charlotte, Julia, or Louisa. Ann and Mary, they're too common; Joan's too formal for a woman; Jane's a prettier name beside; But we had a Jane that died. They would say, if 'twas Rebecca, That she was a little Quaker. Edith's pretty, but that looks Better in old English books; Ellen's left off long ago; Blanche is out of fashion now. None that I have named as yet Are so good as Margaret. Emily is neat and fine. What do you think of Caroline? How I'm puzzled and perplext What to choose or think of next! I am in a little fever. Lest the name that I shall give her Should disgrace her or defame her, I will leave papa to name her. CRUMBS TO THE BIRDS. A bird appears a thoughtless thing, He's ever living on the wing, And keeps up such a carolling, That little else to do but sing A man would guess had he. No doubt he has his little cares, And very hard he often fares, The which so patiently he bears, That, listening to those cheerful airs, Who knows but he may be In want of his next meal of seeds? I think for that his sweet song pleads. If so, his pretty art succeeds. I'll scatter there among the weeds All the small crumbs I see. THE ROOK AND THE SPARROWS. A little boy with crumbs of bread Many a hungry sparrow fed. It was a child of little sense, Who this kind bounty did dispense; For suddenly it was withdrawn, And all the birds were left forlorn, In a hard time of frost and snow, Not knowing where for food to go. He would no longer give them bread, Because he had observed (he said) That sometimes to the window came A great black bird, a rook by name, And took away a small bird's share. So foolish Henry did not care What became of the great rook, That from the little sparrows took, Now and then, as 'twere by stealth, A part of their abundant wealth; Nor ever more would feed his sparrows. Thus ignorance a kind heart narrows. I wish I had been there, I would Have told the child, rooks live by food In the same way that sparrows do. I also would have told him too, Birds act by instinct, and ne'er can Attain the rectitude of man. Nay that even, when distress Does on poor human nature press, We need not be too strict in seeing The failings of a fellow being. DISCONTENT AND QUARRELLING. JANE. Miss Lydia every day is drest Better than I am in my best White cambric-muslin frock. I wish I had one made of clear Worked lawn, or leno very dear.— And then my heart is broke Almost to think how cheap my doll Was bought, when hers cost—yes, cost full A pound, it did, my brother; Nor has she had it weeks quite five, Yet, 'tis as true as I'm alive, She's soon to have another. ROBERT. O mother, hear my sister Jane, How foolishly she does complain, And tease herself for nought. But 'tis the way of all her sex, Thus foolishly themselves to vex. Envy's a female fault. JANE. O brother Robert, say not so; It is not very long ago, Ah! brother, you've forgot, When speaking of a boy you knew, Remember how you said that you Envied his happy lot. ROBERT. Let's see, what were the words I spoke? Why, may be I was half in joke— May be I just might say— Besides that was not half so bad; For, Jane, I only said he had More time than I to play. JANE. O may be, may be, very well: And may be, brother, I don't tell Tales to mamma like you. MOTHER. O cease your wrangling, cease, my dears; You would not wake a mother's fears Thus, if you better knew. REPENTANCE AND RECONCILIATION. JANE. Mamma is displeased and looks very grave, And I own, brother, I was to blame Just now when I told her I wanted to have, Like Miss Lydia, a very fine name. 'Twas foolish, for, Robert, Jane sounds very well, When mamma says, “I love my good Jane.” I've been lately so naughty, I hardly can tell If she ever will say so again. ROBERT. We are each of us foolish, and each of us young, And often in fault and to blame. Jane, yesterday I was too free with my tongue, I acknowledge it now to my shame. For a speech in my good mother's hearing I made, Which reflected upon her whole sex; And now like you, Jenny, I am much afraid That this might my dear mother vex. JANE. But yet, brother Robert, 'twas not quite so bad As that naughty reflection of mine, When I grumbled because Liddy Bellenger had Dolls and dresses expensive and fine. For then 'twas of her, her own self, I complained; Since mamma does provide all I have. MOTHER. Your repentance, my children, I see is unfeigned, You are now my good Robert, and now my good Jane; And if you will never be naughty again, Your fond mother will never look grave. NEATNESS IN APPAREL. In your garb and outward clothing A reservëd plainness use; By their neatness more distinguished Than the brightness of their hues. All the colours in the rainbow Serve to spread the peacock's train; Half the lustre of his feathers Would turn twenty coxcombs vain. Yet the swan that swims in rivers, Pleases the judicious sight; Who, of brighter colours heedless, Trusts alone to simple white. Yet all other hues, comparëd With his whiteness, show amiss; And the peacock's coat of colours Like a fool's coat looks by his. THE NEW-BORN INFANT. Whether beneath sweet beds of roses, As foolish little Ann supposes, The spirit of a babe reposes Before it to the body come; Or, as philosophy more wise Thinks, it descendeth from the skies,— We know the babe's now in the room And that is all which is quite clear Even to philosophy, my dear. The God that made us can alone Reveal from whence a spirit's brought Into young life, to light, and thought; And this the wisest man must own. We'll now talk of the babe's surprise, When first he opens his new eyes, And first receives delicious food. Before the age of six or seven, To mortal children is not given Much reason; or I think he would (And very naturally) wonder What happy star he was born under, That he should be the only care Of the dear sweet-food-giving lady, Who fondly calls him her own baby, Her darling hope, her infant heir. MOTES IN THE SUNBEAMS. The motes up and down in the sun Ever restlessly moving we see; Whereas the great mountains stand still, Unless terrible earthquakes there be. If these atoms that move up and down Were as useful as restless they are, Than a mountain I rather would be A mote in the sunbeam so fair. THE BOY AND SNAKE. Henry was every morning fed With a full mess of milk and bread. One day the boy his breakfast took, And eat it by a purling brook Which through his mother's orchard ran. From that time ever when he can Escape his mother's eye, he there Takes his food in th'open air. Finding the child delight to eat Abroad, and make the grass his seat, His mother lets him have his way. With free leave Henry every day Thither repairs, until she heard Him talking of a fine grey bird. This pretty bird, he said, indeed, Came every day with him to feed, And it loved him, and loved his milk, And it was smooth and soft like silk. His mother thought she'd go and see What sort of bird this same might be. So the next morn she follows Harry, And carefully she sees him carry Through the long grass his heaped-up mess. What was her terror and distress, When she saw the infant take His bread and milk close to a snake! Upon the grass he spreads his feast, And sits down by his frightful guest, Who had waited for the treat; And now they both begin to eat. Fond mother! shriek not, O beware The least small noise, O have a care— The least small noise that may be made, The wily snake will be afraid— If he hear the lightest sound, He will inflict th'envenomed wound. She speaks not, moves not, scarce does breathe, As she stands the trees beneath; No sound she utters; and she soon Sees the child lift up its spoon, And tap the snake upon the head, Fearless of harm; and then he said, As speaking to familiar mate, “Keep on your own side, do, Grey Pate:” The snake then to the other side, As one rebukëd, seems to glide; And now again advancing nigh, Again she hears the infant cry, Tapping the snake, “Keep further, do; Mind, Grey Pate, what I say to you.” The danger's o'er—she sees the boy (O what a change from fear to joy!) Rise and bid the snake “good-bye;” Says he, “Our breakfast's done, and I Will come again to-morrow day:” Then, lightly tripping, ran away. THE FIRST TOOTH. SISTER. Through the house what busy joy, Just because the infant boy Has a tiny tooth to show. I have got a double row, All as white, and all as small; Yet no one cares for mine at all. He can say but half a word, Yet that single sound's preferred To all the words that I can say In the longest summer day. He cannot walk, yet if he put With mimic motion out his foot, As if he thought he were advancing, It's prized more than my best dancing. BROTHER. Sister, I know, you jesting are, Yet O! of jealousy beware. If the smallest seed should be In your mind of jealousy, It will spring, and it will shoot, Till it bear the baneful fruit. I remember you, my dear, Young as is this infant here. There was not a tooth of those Your pretty even ivory rows, But as anxiously was watched, Till it burst its shell new hatched, As if it a Phœnix were, Or some other wonder rare. So when you began to walk— So when you began to talk— As now, the same encomiums past. 'Tis not fitting this should last Longer than our infant days; A child is fed with milk and praise. THE FIRST OF APRIL. “Tell me what is the reason you hang down your head? From your blushes I plainly discern You have done something wrong. Ere you go up to bed, I desire that the truth I may learn.” “O mamma, I have longed to confess all the day What an ill-natured thing I have done; I persuaded myself it was only in play, But such play I in future will shun. “The least of the ladies that live at the school, Her whose eyes are so pretty and blue, Ah! would you believe it? an April fool I have made her, and called her so too. “Yet the words almost choked me; and, as I spoke low, I have hopes that she might them not hear. I had wrapped up some rubbish in paper, and so, The instant the school-girls drew near, “I presented it with a fine bow to the child, And much her acceptance I pressed; When she took it, and thanked me, and gratefully smiled, I never felt half so distressed. “No doubt she concluded some sweetmeats were there, For the paper was white and quite clean, And folded up neatly, as if with great care. O what a rude boy I have been! “Ever since I've been thinking how vexed she will be, Ever since I've done nothing but grieve. If a thousand young ladies a-walking I see, I will never another deceive.” CLEANLINESS. Come, my little Robert, near— Fie! what filthy hands are here— Who that e'er could understand The rare structure of a hand, With its branching fingers fine, Work itself of hands divine, Strong, yet delicately knit, For ten thousand uses fit, Overlaid with so clear skin You may see the blood within, And the curious palm, disposed In such lines, some have supposed You may read the fortunes there By the figures that appear,— Who this hand would choose to cover With a crust of dirt all over, Till it looked in hue and shape Like the fore-foot of an ape? Man or boy that works or plays In the fields or the highways, May, without offence or hurt, From the soil contract a dirt, Which the next clear spring or river Washes out and out for ever— But to cherish stains impure, Soil deliberate to endure, On the skin to fix a stain Till it works into the grain, Argues a degenerate mind, Sordid, slothful, ill inclined, Wanting in that self-respect Which does virtue best protect. All-endearing cleanliness, Virtue next to godliness, Easiest, cheapest, needfull'st duty, To the body health and beauty, Who that's human would refuse it, When a little water does it? THE LAME BROTHER. My parents sleep both in one grave; My only friend's a brother. The dearest things upon the earth We are to one another. A fine stout boy I knew him once, With active form and limb; Whene'er he leaped, or jumped, or ran, O I was proud of him! He leaped too far, he got a hurt, He now does limping go.— When I think on his active days, My heart is full of woe. He leans on me, when we to school Do every morning walk; I cheer him on his weary way, He loves to hear my talk: The theme of which is mostly this, What things he once could do. He listens pleased—then sadly says, “Sister, I lean on you.” Then I reply, “Indeed you're not Scarce any weight at all.— And let us now still younger years To memory recall. “Led by your little elder hand, I learned to walk alone; Careful you used to be of me, My little brother John. “How often, when my young feet tired, You've carried me a mile!— And still together we can sit, And rest a little while. “For our kind master never minds, If we're the very last; He bids us never tire ourselves With walking on too fast.” GOING INTO BREECHES. Joy to Philip, he this day Has his long coats cast away, And (the childish season gone) Puts the manly breeches on. Officer on gay parade, Red-coat in his first cockade, Bridegroom in his wedding trim, Birthday beau surpassing him, Never did with conscious gait Strut about in half the state, Or the pride (yet free from sin) Of my little Manikin: Never was there pride, or bliss, Half so rational as his. Sashes, frocks, to those that need 'em— Philip's limbs have got their freedom— He can run, or he can ride, And do twenty things beside, Which his petticoats forbad: Is he not a happy lad? Now he's under other banners, He must leave his former manners; Bid adieu to female games, And forget their very names, Puss-in-corners, hide-and-seek, Sports for girls and punies weak! Baste-the-bear he now may play at, Leap-frog, foot-ball, sport away at, Show his strength and skill at cricket, Mark his distance, pitch his wicket, Run about in winter's snow Till his cheeks and fingers glow, Climb a tree, or scale a wall, Without any fear to fall. If he get a hurt or bruise, To complain he must refuse, Though the anguish and the smart Go unto his little heart, He must have his courage ready, Keep his voice and visage steady, Brace his eye-balls stiff as drum, That a tear may never come, And his grief must only speak From the colour in his cheek. This and more he must endure, Hero he in miniature! This and more must now be done Now the breeches are put on. NURSING. O hush, my little baby brother; Sleep, my love, upon my knee. What though, dear child, we've lost our mother; That can never trouble thee. You are but ten weeks old to-morrow; What can you know of our loss? The house is full enough of sorrow. Little baby, don't be cross. Peace, cry not so, my dearest love; Hush, my baby-bird, lie still.— He's quiet now, he does not move, Fast asleep is little Will. My only solace, only joy, Since the sad day I lost my mother, Is nursing her own Willy boy, My little orphan brother. THE TEXT. One Sunday eve a grave old man, Who had not been at church, did say, “Eliza, tell me, if you can, What text our Doctor took to-day?” She hung her head, she blushed for shame, One single word she did not know, Nor verse nor chapter she could name, Her silent blushes told him so. Again said he, “My little maid, What in the sermon did you hear? Come tell me that, for that may aid Me to find out the text, my dear.” A tear stole down each blushing cheek, She wished she better had attended; She sobbing said, when she could speak, She heard not till 'twas almost ended. “Ah! little heedless one, why what Could you be thinking on? 'tis clear Some foolish fancies must have got Possession of your head, my dear. “What thoughts were they, Eliza, tell, Nor seek from me the truth to smother.”— “O I remember very well, I whispered something to my brother. “I said, ‘Be friends with me, dear Will;’ We quarrelled, sir, at the church door,— Though he cried, ‘Hush, don't speak, be still,’ Yet I repeated these words o'er “Seven or eight times, I have no doubt. But here comes William, and if he The good things he has heard about Forgets too, sir, the fault's in me.” “No, sir,” said William, “though perplext And much disturbed by my sister, I in this matter of the text, I thank my memory, can assist her. “I have, and pride myself on having, A more retentive head than she.”— Then gracefully his right hand waving, He with no little vanity Recited gospel, chapter, verse— I should be loth to spoil in metre All the good words he did rehearse, As spoken by our Lord to Peter. But surely never words from heaven Of peace and love more full descended; That we should seventy times seven Forgive our brother that offended. In every point of view he placed it, As he the Doctor's self had been, With emphasis and action graced it: But from his self-conceit 'twas seen Who had brought home the words, and who had A little on the meaning thought; Eliza now the old man knew had Learned that which William never caught. Without impeaching William's merit, His head but served him for the letter; Hers missed the words, but kept the spirit; Her memory to her heart was debtor. THE END OF MAY. “Our governess is not in school, So we may talk a bit; Sit down upon this little stool, Come, little Mary, sit: “And, my dear playmate, tell me why In dismal black you're drest? Why does the tear stand in your eye? With sobs why heaves your breast? “When we're in grief, it gives relief Our sorrows to impart; When you've told why, my dear, you cry, 'Twill ease your little heart.” “O, it is trouble very bad Which causes me to weep; All last night long we were so sad, Not one of us could sleep. “Beyond the seas my father went, 'Twas very long ago; And he last week a letter sent (I told you so, you know) “That he was safe in Portsmouth bay, And we should see him soon, Either the latter end of May, Or by the first of June. “The end of May was yesterday, We all expected him; And in our best clothes we were dressed, Susan, and I, and Jim. “O how my poor dear mother smiled, And clapped her hands for joy; She said to me, ‘Come here, my child, And Susan, and my boy. “‘Come all, and let us think,’ said she, ‘What we can do to please Your father, for to-day will he Come home from off the seas. “‘That you have won, my dear young son, A prize at school, we'll tell, Because you can, my little man, In writing all excel: “‘And you have made a poem, nearly All of your own invention: Will not your father love you dearly When this to him I mention? “‘Your sister Mary, she can say Your poetry by heart; And to repeat your verses may Be little Mary's part. “‘Susan, for you, I'll say you do Your needlework with care, And stitch so true the wristbands new Dear father's soon to wear!’ “‘O hark!’ said James; ‘I hear one speak; 'Tis like a seaman's voice.’— Our mother gave a joyful shriek; How did we all rejoice! “‘My husband's come!’ ‘My father's here!’ But O, alas, it was not so; It was not as we said: A stranger seaman did appear, On his rough cheek there stood a tear, For he brought to us a tale of woe,— Our father dear was dead.” FEIGNED COURAGE. Horatio, of ideal courage vain, Was flourishing in air his father's cane, And, as the fumes of valour swelled his pate, Now thought himself this hero, and now that: “And now,” he cried, “I will Achilles be; My sword I brandish; see, the Trojans flee. Now I'll be Hector, when his angry blade A lane through heaps of slaughtered Grecians made! And now by deeds still braver I'll evince I am no less than Edward the Black Prince.— Give way, ye coward French—” As thus he spoke, And aimed in fancy a sufficient stroke To fix the fate of Cressy or Poictiers (The Muse relates the hero's fate with tears); He struck his milk-white hand against a nail, Sees his own blood, and feels his courage fail. Ah! where is now that boasted valour flown, That in the tented field so late was shown! Achilles weeps, Great Hector hangs the head, And the Black Prince goes whimpering to bed. THE BROKEN DOLL. An infant is a selfish sprite; But what of that? the sweet delight Which from participation springs, Is quite unknown to these young things. We elder children then will smile At our dear little John awhile, And bear with him, until he see There is a sweet felicity In pleasing more than only one Dear little craving selfish John. He laughs, and thinks it a fine joke, That he our new wax doll has broke. Anger will never teach him better; We will the spirit and the letter Of courtesy to him display By taking in a friendly way These baby frolics; till he learn True sport from mischief to discern. Reproof a parent's province is: A sister's discipline is this; By studied kindness to effect A little brother's young respect. What is a doll? a fragile toy. What is its loss? if the dear boy, Who half perceives he's done amiss, Retain impression of the kiss That followed instant on his cheek; If the kind, loving words we speak Of “Never mind it,” “We forgive,”— If these in his short memory live Only, perchance, for half a day— Who minds a doll—if that should lay The first impression in his mind That sisters are to brothers kind? For thus the broken doll may prove Foundation to fraternal love. THE DUTY OF A BROTHER. Why on your sister do you look, Octavius, with an eye of scorn, As scarce her presence you could brook?— Under one roof you both were born. Why, when she gently proffers speech, Do you ungently turn your head? Since the same sire gave life to each; With the same milk ye both were fed. Such treatment to a female, though A perfect stranger she might be, From you would most unmanly show; In you to her 'tis worse to see. When any ill-bred boys offend her, Showing their manhood by their sneers, It is your business to defend her 'Gainst their united taunts and jeers. And not to join the illiberal crew In their contempt of female merit; What's bad enough in them, from you Is want of goodness, want of spirit. What if your rougher out-door sports Her less robustious spirits daunt; And if she join not the resorts Where you and your wild playmates haunt: Her milder province is at home; When your diversions have an end, When over-toiled from play you come, You'll find in her an in-doors friend. Leave not your sister to another; As long as both of you reside In the same house, who but her brother Should point her books, her studies guide? If Nature, who allots our cup, Than her has made you stronger, wiser; It is that you, as you grow up, Should be her champion, her adviser. It is the law that hand intends Which framed diversity of sex; The man the woman still defends, The manly boy the girl protects. WASPS IN A GARDEN. The wall-trees are laden with fruit; The grape, and the plum, and the pear, The peach and the nectarine, to suit Every taste, in abundance are there. Yet all are not welcome to taste These kind bounties of Nature; for one From her open-spread table must haste To make room for a more favoured son: As that wasp will soon sadly perceive, Who has feasted awhile on a plum; And, his thirst thinking now to relieve, For a sweet liquid draught he is come. He peeps in the narrow-mouthed glass, Which depends from a branch of the tree; He ventures to creep down,—alas! To be drowned in that delicate sea. “Ah say,” my dear friend, “is it right These glass bottles are hung upon trees? Midst a scene of inviting delight Should we find such mementos as these?” “From such sights,” said my friend, “we may draw A lesson, for look at that bee; Compared with the wasp which you saw, He will teach us what we ought to be. “He in safety industriously plies His sweet honest work all the day, Then home with his earnings he flies; Nor in thieving his time wastes away.”— “O hush, nor with fables deceive,” I replied, “which, though pretty, can ne'er Make me cease for that insect to grieve, Who in agony still does appear. “If a simile ever you need, You are welcome to make a wasp do; But you ne'er should mix fiction indeed With things that are serious and true.” WHAT IS FANCY? SISTER. I am to write three lines, and you Three others that will rhyme. There—now I've done my task. BROTHER. Three stupid lines as e'er I knew. When you've the pen next time, Some question of me ask. SISTER. Then tell me, brother, and pray mind, Brother, you tell me true: What sort of thing is fancy? BROTHER. By all that I can ever find, 'Tis something that is very new, And what no dunces can see. SISTER. That is not half the way to tell What fancy is about; So pray now tell me more. BROTHER. Sister, I think 'twere quite as well That you should find it out; So think the matter o'er. SISTER. It's what comes in our heads when we Play at “Let's-make-believe,” And when we play at “Guessing.” BROTHER. And I have heard it said to be A talent often makes us grieve, And sometimes proves a blessing. ANGER. Anger in its time and place May assume a kind of grace. It must have some reason in it, And not last beyond a minute. If to further lengths it go, It does into malice grow. 'Tis the difference that we see 'Twixt the serpent and the bee. If the latter you provoke, It inflicts a hasty stroke, Puts you to some little pain, But it never stings again. Close in tufted bush or brake Lurks the poison-swellëd snake Nursing up his cherished wrath; In the purlieux of his path, In the cold, or in the warm, Mean him good, or mean him harm, Whensoever fate may bring you, The vile snake will always sting you. BLINDNESS. In a stage-coach, where late I chanced to be, A little quiet girl my notice caught; I saw she looked at nothing by the way, Her mind seemed busy on some childish thought. I with an old man's courtesy addressed The child, and called her pretty dark-eyed maid, And bid her turn those pretty eyes and see The wide extended prospect. “Sir,” she said, “I cannot see the prospect, I am blind.” Never did tongue of child utter a sound So mournful, as her words fell on my ear. Her mother then related how she found Her child was sightless. On a fine bright day She saw her lay her needlework aside, And, as on such occasions mothers will, For leaving off her work began to chide. “I'll do it when 'tis daylight, if you please, I cannot work, mamma, now it is night.” The sun shone bright upon her when she spoke, And yet her eyes received no ray of light. THE MIMIC HARLEQUIN. “I'll make believe, and fancy something strange: I will suppose I have the power to change And make all things unlike to what they were, To jump through windows and fly through the air, And quite confound all places and all times, Like harlequins we see in pantomimes. These thread-papers my wooden sword must be, Nothing more like one I at present see. And now all round this drawing-room I'll range, And every thing I look at I will change. Here's Mopsa, our old cat, shall be a bird; To a Poll parrot she is now transferred. Here's mamma's work-bag, now I will engage To whisk this little bag into a cage; And now, my pretty parrot, get you in it, Another change I'll show you in a minute.” “O fie, you naughty child, what have you done? There never was so mischievous a son. You've put the cat among my work, and torn A fine laced cap that I but once have worn.” WRITTEN IN THE FIRST LEAF OF A CHILD'S MEMORANDUM-BOOK. My neat and pretty book, when I thy small lines see They seem for any use to be unfit for me. My writing, all misshaped, uneven as my mind, Within this narrow space can hardly be confined. Yet I will strive to make my hand less awkward look; I would not willingly disgrace thee, my neat book. The finest pens I'll use, and wondrous pains I'll take, And I these perfect lines my monitors will make. And every day I will set down in order due How that day wasted is; and should there be a few At the year's end that show more goodly to the sight, If haply here I find some days not wasted quite, If a small portion of them I have passed aright, Then shall I think the year not wholly was misspent, And that my Diary has been by some good angel sent. MEMORY. “For gold could Memory be bought, What treasures would she not be worth? If from afar she could be brought, I'd travel for her through the earth!” This exclamation once was made By one who had obtained the name Of young forgetful Adelaide: And while she spoke, lo! Memory came.— If Memory indeed it were, Or such it only feigned to be— A female figure came to her, Who said, “My name is Memory: “Gold purchases in me no share, Nor do I dwell in distant land; Study, and thought, and watchful care, In every place may me command. “I am not lightly to be won; A visit only now I make: And much must by yourself be done, Ere me you for an inmate take. “The only substitute for me Was ever found, is called a pen: The frequent use of that will be The way to make me come again.” THE REPROOF. Mamma heard me with scorn and pride A wretched beggar-boy deride. “Do you not know,” said I, “how mean It is to be thus begging seen? If for a week I were not fed, I'm sure I would not beg my bread.” And then away she saw me stalk With a most self-important walk. But meeting her upon the stairs, All these my consequential airs Were changed to an entreating look. “Give me,” said I, “the pocket-book, Mamma, you promised I should have.” The pocket-book to me she gave; After reproof and counsel sage She bade me write in the first page This naughty action all in rhyme; No food to have until the time, In writing fair and neatly worded, The unfeeling fact I had recorded. Slow I compose, and slow I write; And now I feel keen hunger bite. My mother's pardon I entreat, And beg she'll give me food to eat. Dry bread would be received with joy By her repentant beggar-boy. THE TWO BEES. But a few words could William say, And those few could not speak plain, Yet thought he was a man one day; Never saw I boy so vain. From what could vanity proceed In such a little lisping lad? Or was it vanity indeed? Or was he only very glad? For he without his maid may go To the heath with elder boys, And pluck ripe berries where they grow: Well may William then rejoice. Be careful of your little charge; Elder boys, let him not rove; The heath is wide, the heath is large, From your sight he must not move. But rove he did: they had not been One short hour the heath upon, When he was nowhere to be seen; “Where,” said they, “is William gone?” Mind not the elder boys' distress; Let them run, and let them fly. Their own neglect and giddiness They are justly suffering by. William his little basket filled With his berries ripe and red; Then, naughty boy, two bees he killed, Under foot he stamped them dead. William had coursed them o'er the heath, After them his steps did wander; When he was nearly out of breath, The last bee his foot was under. A cruel triumph which did not Last but for a moment's space, For now he finds that he has got Out of sight of every face. What are the berries now to him? What the bees which he has slain? Fear now possesses every limb, He cannot trace his steps again. The poor bees William had affrighted In more terror did not haste Than he from bush to bush, benighted And alone amid the waste. Late in the night the child was found: He who these two bees had crushed Was lying on the cold damp ground, Sleep had then his sorrows hushed. A fever followed from the fright, And from sleeping in the dew; He many a day and many a night Suffered ere he better grew. His aching limbs while sick he lay Made him learn the crushed bees' pain; Oft would he to his mother say, “I ne'er will kill a bee again.” THE JOURNEY FROM SCHOOL AND TO SCHOOL. O what a joyous joyous day Is that on which we come At the recess from school away, Each lad to his own home! What though the coach is crammëd full, The weather very warm; Think you a boy of us is dull, Or feels the slightest harm? The dust and sun is life and fun; The hot and sultry weather A higher zest gives every breast, Thus jumbled all together. Sometimes we laugh aloud, aloud, Sometimes huzzah, huzzah. Who is so buoyant, free, and proud As we home travellers are? But sad, but sad is every lad That day on which we come, That last last day on which away We all come from our home. The coach too full is found to be; Why is it crammëd thus? Now every one can plainly see There's not half room for us. Soon we exclaim, O shame, O shame, This hot and sultry weather, Who but our master is to blame Who packed us thus together! Now dust and sun does every one Most terribly annoy; Complaints begun, soon every one Elbows his neighbour boy. Not now the joyous laugh goes round, We shout not now huzzah; A sadder group may not be found Than we returning are. THE ORANGE. The month was June, the day was hot, And Philip had an orange got, The fruit was fragrant, tempting, bright, Refreshing to the smell and sight; Not of that puny size which calls Poor customers to common stalls, But large and massy, full of juice, As any Lima can produce. The liquor would, if squeezëd out, Have filled a tumbler—thereabout. The happy boy, with greedy eyes, Surveys and re-surveys his prize. He turns it round, and longs to drain, And with the juice his lips to stain, His throat and lips were parched with heat; The orange seemed to cry, Come eat, He from his pocket draws a knife— When in his thoughts there rose a strife, Which folks experience when they wish Yet scruple to begin a dish, And by their hesitation own It is too good to eat alone. But appetite o'er indecision Prevails, and Philip makes incision. The melting fruit in quarters came,— Just then there passëd by a dame, One of the poorer sort she seemed, As by her garb you would have deemed,— Who in her toil-worn arms did hold A sickly infant ten months old; That from a fever, caught in spring, Was slowly then recovering. The child, attracted by the view Of that fair orange, feebly threw A languid look—perhaps the smell Convinced it that there sure must dwell A corresponding sweetness there, Where lodged a scent so good and rare— Perhaps the smell the fruit did give Felt healing and restorative— For never had the child been graced To know such dainties by their taste. When Philip saw the infant crave, He straightway to the mother gave His quartered orange; nor would stay To hear her thanks, but tripped away. Then to the next clear spring he ran To quench his drought, a happy man! THE YOUNG LETTER WRITER. Dear Sir, Dear Madam, or Dear Friend, With ease are written at the top; When those two happy words are penned, A youthful writer oft will stop, And bite his pen, and lift his eyes As if he thinks to find in air The wished-for following words, or tries To fix his thoughts by fixëd stare. But haply all in vain—the next Two words may be so long before They'll come, the writer, sore perplext, Gives in despair the matter o'er; And when maturer age he sees With ready pen so swift inditing, With envy he beholds the ease Of long-accustomed letter-writing. Courage, young friend; the time may be When you attain maturer age, Some young as you are now may see You with like ease glide down a page. Even then when you, to years a debtor, In varied phrase your meanings wrap, The welcomest words in all your letter May be those two kind words at top. THE THREE FRIENDS. Three young girls in friendship met; Mary, Martha, Margaret. Margaret was tall and fair, Martha shorter by a hair; If the first excelled in feature, The other's grace and ease were greater; Mary, though to rival loth, In their best gifts equalled both. They a due proportion kept; Martha mourned if Margaret wept; Margaret joyed when any good She of Martha understood; And in sympathy for either Mary was outdone by neither. Thus far, for a happy space, All three ran an even race, A most constant friendship proving, Equally beloved and loving; All their wishes, joys, the same; Sisters only not in name. Fortune upon each one smiled, As upon a favourite child; Well to do and well to see Were the parents of all three; Till on Martha's father crosses Brought a flood of worldly losses, And his fortunes rich and great Changed at once to low estate; Under which o'erwhelming blow Martha's mother was laid low; She a hapless orphan left, Of maternal care bereft, Trouble following trouble fast, Lay in a sick bed at last. In the depth of her affliction Martha now received conviction, That a true and faithful friend Can the surest comfort lend. Night and day, with friendship tried, Ever constant by her side Was her gentle Mary found, With a love that knew no bound; And the solace she imparted Saved her dying broken-hearted. In this scene of earthly things There's no good unmixëd springs. That which had to Martha proved A sweet consolation, moved Different feelings of regret In the mind of Margaret. She, whose love was not less dear, Nor affection less sincere To her friend, was, by occasion Of more distant habitation, Fewer visits forced to pay her, When no other cause did stay her; And her Mary living nearer, Margaret began to fear her, Lest her visits day by day Martha's heart should steal away. That whole heart she ill could spare her Where till now she'd been a sharer. From this cause with grief she pined, Till at length her health declined. All her cheerful spirits flew, Fast as Martha gathered new; And her sickness waxëd sore, Just when Martha felt no more. Mary, who had quick suspicion Of her altered friend's condition, Seeing Martha's convalescence Less demanded now her presence, With a goodness built on reason, Changed her measures with the season; Turned her steps from Martha's door, Went where she was wanted more; All her care and thoughts were set Now to tend on Margaret. Mary living 'twixt the two, From her home could oftener go, Either of her friends to see, Than they could together be. Truth explained is to suspicion Evermore the best physician. Soon her visits had the effect; All that Margaret did suspect, From her fancy vanished clean; She was soon what she had been, And the colour she did lack To her faded cheek came back. Wounds which love had made her feel, Love alone had power to heal. Martha, who the frequent visit Now had lost, and sore did miss it, With impatience waxed cross, Counted Margaret's gain her loss: All that Mary did confer On her friend, thought due to her. In her girlish bosom rise Little foolish jealousies, Which into such rancour wrought, She one day for Margaret sought; Finding her by chance alone, She began, with reasons shown, To insinuate a fear Whether Mary was sincere; Wished that Margaret would take heed Whence her actions did proceed; For herself, she'd long been minded Not with outsides to be blinded; All that pity and compassion, She believed was affectation; In her heart she doubted whether Mary cared a pin for either; She could keep whole weeks at distance, And not know of their existence, While all things remained the same; But, when some misfortune came, Then she made a great parade Of her sympathy and aid,— Not that she did really grieve, It was only make-believe; And she cared for nothing, so She might her fine feelings show, And get credit, on her part, For a soft and tender heart. With such speeches, smoothly made, She found methods to persuade Margaret (who, being sore From the doubts she felt before, Was prepared for mistrust) To believe her reasons just; Quite destroyed that comfort glad, Which in Mary late she had; Made her, in experience' spite, Think her friend a hypocrite, And resolve, with cruel scoff, To renounce and cast her off. See how good turns are rewarded! She of both is now discarded, Who to both had been so late Their support in low estate, All their comfort, and their stay— Now of both is cast away. But the league her presence cherished, Losing its best prop, soon perished; She, that was a link to either, To keep them and it together, Being gone, the two (no wonder) That were left, soon fell asunder; Some civilities were kept, But the heart of friendship slept; Love with hollow forms was fed, But the life of love lay dead: A cold intercourse they held After Mary was expelled. Two long years did intervene Since they'd either of them seen, Or, by letter, any word Of their old companion heard, When, upon a day, once walking, Of indifferent matters talking, They a female figure met.— Martha said to Margaret, “That young maid in face does carry A resemblance strong of Mary.” Margaret, at nearer sight, Owned her observation right; But they did not far proceed Ere they knew 'twas she indeed. She—but, ah! how changed they view her From that person which they knew her! Her fine face disease had scarred, And its matchless beauty marred: But enough was left to trace Mary's sweetness—Mary's grace. When her eye did first behold them How they blushed!—but when she told them How on a sick bed she lay Months, while they had kept away, And had no inquiries made If she were alive or dead;— How, for want of a true friend, She was brought near to her end, And was like so to have died, With no friend at her bedside;— How the constant irritation, Caused by fruitless expectation Of their coming, had extended The illness, when she might have mended; Then, O then, how did reflection Come on them with recollection! All that she had done for them, How it did their fault condemn! But sweet Mary, still the same, Kindly eased them of their shame; Spoke to them with accents bland, Took them friendly by the hand; Bound them both with promise fast Not to speak of troubles past; Made them on the spot declare A new league of friendship there; Which, without a word of strife, Lasted thenceforth long as life. Martha now and Margaret Strove who most should pay the debt Which they owed her, nor did vary Ever after from their Mary. ON THE LORD'S PRAYER. I have taught your young lips the good words to say over, Which form the petition we call the Lord's Prayer, And now let me help my dear child to discover The meaning of all the good words that are there. “Our Father,”—the same appellation is given To a parent on earth, and the Parent of all— O gracious permission! the God that's in heaven Allows his poor creatures him Father to call. To “hallow his name,” is to think with devotion Of it, and with reverence mention the same; Though you are so young, you should strive for some notion Of the awe we should feel at the Holy One's name. His “will done on earth, as it is done in heaven,” Is a wish and a hope we are suffered to breathe That such grace and favour to us may be given, Like good angels on high we may live here beneath. “Our daily bread give us,” your young apprehension May well understand is to pray for our food; Although we ask bread, and no other thing mention, God's bounty gives all things sufficient and good. You pray that your “trespasses may be forgiven, As you forgive those that are done unto you.” Before this you say to the God that's in heaven, Consider the words which you speak. Are they true? If any one has in the past time offended Us angry creatures who soon take offence, These words in the prayer are surely intended To soften our minds, and expel wrath from thence. We pray that “temptations may never assail us,” And “deliverance beg from all evil” we find: But we never can hope that our prayer will avail us, If we strive not to banish ill thoughts from our mind. “For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, For ever and ever:” these titles are meant To express God's dominion and majesty o'er ye: And “Amen” to the sense of the whole gives assent. “SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN, AND FORBID THEM NOT, TO COME UNTO ME.” To Jesus our Saviour some parents presented Their children—what fears and what hopes they must feel! When this the disciples would fain have prevented, Our Saviour reproved their unseasonable zeal. Not only free leave to come to him was given But “of such” were the blessed words Christ our Lord spake, “Of such is composed the kingdom of heaven:” The disciples, abashëd, perceived their mistake. With joy then the parents their children brought nigher And earnestly begged that his hands he would lay On their heads; and they made a petition still higher, That he for a blessing upon them would pray. O happy young children, thus brought to adore him, To kneel at his feet, and look up in his face; No doubt now in heaven they still are before him, Children still of his love, and enjoying his grace. For being so blest as to come to our Saviour, How deep in their innocent hearts it must sink! 'Twas a visit divine; a most holy behaviour Must flow from that spring of which then they did drink. THE MAGPIE'S NEST, OR A LESSON OF DOCILITY. A FABLE. When the arts in their infancy were, In a fable of old 'tis exprest, A wise magpie constructed that rare Little house for young birds, called a nest. This was talked of the whole country round, You might hear it on every bough sung, “Now no longer upon the rough ground Will fond mothers brood over their young. “For the magpie with exquisite skill Has invented a moss-covered cell, Within which a whole family will In the utmost security dwell.” To her mate did each female bird say, “Let us fly to the magpie, my dear; If she will but teach us the way, A nest we will build us up here. “It's a thing that's close arched over head, With a hole made to creep out and in; We, my bird, might make just such a bed, If we only knew how to begin.” To the magpie soon every bird went, And in modest terms made their request, That she would be pleased to consent To teach them to build up a nest. She replied, “I will show you the way, So observe every thing that I do. First two sticks cross each other I lay”— “To be sure,” said the crow; “why, I knew “It must be begun with two sticks, And I thought that they crossëd should be.” Said the pie, “Then some straw and moss mix, In the way you now see done by me.” “O yes, certainly,” said the jackdaw, “That must follow of course, I have thought; Though I never before building saw, I guessed that without being taught.” “More moss, straw, and feathers, I place, In this manner,” continued the pie. “Yes, no doubt, madam, that is the case; Though no builder myself, even I,” Said the starling, “conjectured 'twas so; It must of necessity follow: For more moss, straw, and feathers, I know, It requires, to be soft, round, and hollow.” Whatever she taught them beside, In his turn every bird of them said, Though the nest-making art he ne'er tried, He had just such a thought in his head. Still the pie went on showing her art, Till a nest she had built up half way; She no more of her skill would impart, But in anger went fluttering away. And this speech in their hearing she made, As she perched o'er their heads on a tree, “If ye all were well skilled in my trade, Pray, why came ye to learn it of me?”— When a scholar is willing to learn, He with silent submission should hear. Too late they their folly discern; The effect to this day does appear: For whenever a pie's nest you see, Her charming warm canopy view, All birds' nests but hers seem to be A magpie's nest just cut in two. THE BOY AND THE SKYLARK. A FABLE. “A wicked action fear to do, When you are by yourself; for though You think you can conceal it, A little bird that's in the air The hidden trespass shall declare, And openly reveal it.” Richard this saying oft had heard, Until the sight of any bird Would set his heart a-quaking; He saw a host of wingëd spies For ever o'er him in the skies, Note of his actions taking. This pious precept, while it stood In his remembrance, kept him good When nobody was by him; For though no human eye was near, Yet Richard still did wisely fear The little bird should spy him. But best resolves will sometimes sleep; Poor frailty will not always keep From that which is forbidden; And Richard, one day, left alone, Laid hands on something not his own, And hoped the theft was hidden. His conscience slept a day or two, As it is very apt to do When we with pains suppress it: And though at times a slight remorse Would raise a pang, it had not force To make him yet confess it. When on a day, as he abroad Walked by his mother, in their road He heard a skylark singing; Smit with the sound, a flood of tears Proclaimed the superstitious fears His inmost bosom wringing. His mother, wondering, saw him cry, And fondly asked the reason why; Then Richard made confession, And said, he feared the little bird He singing in the air had heard Was telling his transgression. The words which Richard spoke below, As sounds by nature upwards go, Were to the skylark carried; The airy traveller with surprise To hear his sayings, in the skies On his mid journey tarried. His anger then the bird exprest: “Sure, since the day I left the nest, I ne'er heard folly uttered So fit to move a skylark's mirth, As what this little son of earth Hath in his grossness muttered. “Dull fool! to think we sons of air On man's low actions waste a care, His virtues or his vices; Or soaring on the summer gales, That we should stoop to carry tales Of him or his devices! “Our songs are all of the delights We find in our wild airy flights, And heavenly exaltation; The earth you mortals have at heart Is all too gross to have a part In skylark's conversation. “Unless it be in what green field Or meadow we our nest may build, Midst flowering broom, or heather; From whence our new-fledged offspring may With least obstruction wing their way Up to the walks of ether. “Mistaken fool! man needs not us His secret merits to discuss, Or spy out his transgression; When once he feels his conscience stirred, That voice within him is the bird That moves him to confession.” THE MEN AND WOMEN, AND THE MONKEYS. A FABLE. When beasts by words their meanings could declare, Some well-dressed men and women did repair To gaze upon two monkeys at a fair: And one who was the spokesman in the place Said, in their countenance you might plainly trace The likeness of a withered old man's face. His observation none impeached or blamed, But every man and woman when 'twas named Drew in the head, or slunk away ashamed. One monkey, who had more pride than the other, His infinite chagrin could scarcely smother; But Pug the wiser said unto his brother: “The slights and coolness of this human nation Should give a sensible ape no mortification; 'Tis thus they always serve a poor relation.” LOVE, DEATH, AND REPUTATION. A FABLE. Once on a time, Love, Death, and Reputation, Three travellers, a tour together went; And, after many a long perambulation, Agreed to part by mutual consent. Death said: “My fellow tourists, I am going To seek for harvests in the embattled plain; Where drums are beating, and loud trumpets blowing, There you'll be sure to meet with me again.” Love said: “My friends, I mean to spend my leisure With some young couple, fresh in Hymen's bands; Or 'mongst relations, who in equal measure Have had bequeathëd to them house or lands.” But Reputation said: “If once we sever, Our chance of future meeting is but vain: Who parts from me, must look to part for ever, For Reputation lost comes not again.” THE SPARROW AND THE HEN. A sparrow, when sparrows like parrots could speak, Addressed an old hen who could talk like a jay: Said he, “It's unjust that we sparrows must seek Our food, when your family's fed every day. “Were you like the peacock, that elegant bird, The sight of whose plumage her master may please, I then should not wonder that you are preferred To the yard, where in affluence you live at your ease. “I affect no great style, am not costly in feathers, A good honest brown I find most to my liking, It always looks neat, and is fit for all weathers, But I think your grey mixture is not very striking. “We know that the bird from the isles of Canary Is fed, foreign airs to sing in a fine cage; But your note from a cackle so seldom does vary, The fancy of man it cannot much engage. “My chirp to a song sure approaches much nearer, Nay the nightingale tells me I sing not amiss; If voice were in question I ought to be dearer; But the owl he assures me there's nothing in this. “Nor is it your proneness to domestication, For he dwells in man's barn, and I build in man's thatch, As we say to each other—but, to our vexation, O'er your safety alone man keeps diligent watch.” “Have you e'er learned to read?” said the hen to the sparrow, “No, madam,” he answered, “I can't say I have.” “Then that is the reason your sight is so narrow,” The old hen replied, with a look very grave. “Mrs. Glasse in a Treatise—I wish you could read— Our importance has shown, and has proved to us why Man shields us and feeds us: of us he has need Even before we are born, even after we die.” WHICH IS THE FAVOURITE? Brothers and sisters I have many: Though I know there is not any Of them but I love, yet I Will just name them all; and try If there be one a little more Loved by me than all the rest. Yes; I do think, that I love best My brother Henry, because he Has always been most fond of me. Yet, to be sure, there's Isabel; I think I love her quite as well. And, I assure you, little Ann, No brother nor no sister can Be more dear to me than she. Only I must say, Emily, Being the eldest, it's right her To all the rest I should prefer. Yet after all I've said, suppose My greatest favourite should be Rose. No, John and Paul are both more dear To me than Rose, that's always here, While they are half the year at school; And yet that neither is no rule. I've named them all, there's only seven; I find my love to all so even, To every sister, every brother, I love not one more than another. THE BEGGAR-MAN. Abject, stooping, old, and wan, See yon wretched beggar-man; Once a father's hopeful heir, Once a mother's tender care. When too young to understand He but scorched his little hand, By the candle's flaming light Attracted, dancing, spiral, bright, Clasping fond her darling round, A thousand kisses healed the wound. Now abject, stooping, old, and wan, No mother tends the beggar-man. Then nought too good for him to wear, With cherub face and flaxen hair, In fancy's choicest gauds arrayed, Cap of lace with rose to aid, Milk-white hat and feather blue, Shoes of red, and coral too With silver bells to please his ear, And charm the frequent ready tear. Now abject, stooping, old, and wan, Neglected is the beggar-man. See the boy advance in age, And learning spreads her useful page; In vain! for giddy pleasure calls, And shows the marbles, tops, and balls. What's learning to the charms of play? The indulgent tutor must give way. A heedless wilful dunce, and wild, The parents' fondness spoiled the child; The youth in vagrant courses ran; Now abject, stooping, old, and wan, Their fondling is the beggar-man. CHOOSING A PROFESSION. A Creole boy from the West Indies brought, To be in European learning taught, Some years before to Westminster he went, To a preparatory school was sent. When from his artless tale the mistress found, The child had not one friend on English ground, She, even as if she his own mother were, Made the dark Indian her peculiar care. Oft on her favourite's future lot she thought; To know the bent of his young mind she sought, For much the kind preceptress wished to find To what profession he was most inclined, That where his genius led they might him train; For nature's kindly bent she held not vain. But vain her efforts to explore his will; The frequent question he evaded still: Till on a day at length he to her came, Joy sparkling in his eyes; and said, the same Trade he would be those boys of colour were, Who danced so happy in the open air. It was a troop of chimney-sweeping boys, With wooden music and obstreperous noise, In tarnished finery and grotesque array, Were dancing in the street the first of May. BREAKFAST. A dinner party, coffee, tea, Sandwich, or supper, all may be In their way pleasant. But to me Not one of these deserves the praise That welcomer of new-born days, A breakfast, merits; ever giving Cheerful notice we are living Another day refreshed by sleep, When its festival we keep. Now although I would not slight Those kindly words we use, “Good night,” Yet parting words are words of sorrow, And may not vie with sweet “Good morrow,” With which again our friends we greet, When in the breakfast-room we meet, At the social table round, Listening to the lively sound Of those notes which never tire, Of urn, or kettle on the fire. Sleepy Robert never hears Or urn or kettle; he appears When all have finished, one by one Dropping off, and breakfast done. Yet has he too his own pleasure, His breakfast hour's his hour of leisure; And, left alone, he reads or muses, Or else in idle mood he uses To sit and watch the venturous fly, Where the sugar's pilëd high, Clambering o'er the lumps so white, Rocky cliffs of sweet delight. WEEDING. As busy Aurelia, 'twixt work and 'twixt play, Was labouring industriously hard To cull the vile weeds from the flowerets away, Which grew in her father's court-yard; In her juvenile anger, wherever she found, She plucked, and she pulled, and she tore; The poor passive sufferers bestrewed all the ground; Not a weed of them all she forbore. At length 'twas her chance on some nettles to light (Things, till then, she had scarcely heard named); The vulgar intruders called forth all her spite; In a transport of rage she exclaimed, “Shall briars so unsightly and worthless as those Their great sprawling leaves thus presume To mix with the pink, the jonquil, and the rose, And take up a flower's sweet room?” On the odious offenders enragëd she flew; But she presently found to her cost A tingling unlooked for, a pain that was new, And rage was in agony lost. To her father she hastily fled for relief, And told him her pain and her smart; With kindly caresses he soothëd her grief, Then smiling he took the weed's part. “The world, my Aurelia, this garden of ours Resembles: too apt we're to deem In the world's larger garden ourselves as the flowers, And the poor but as weeds to esteem. “But them if we rate, or with rudeness repel, Though some will be passive enough, From others who 're more independent 'tis well If we meet not a stinging rebuff.” PARENTAL RECOLLECTIONS. A child's a plaything for an hour; Its pretty tricks we try For that or for a longer space; Then tire, and lay it by. But I knew one that to itself All seasons could control; That would have mocked the sense of pain Out of a grievëd soul. Thou straggler into loving arms, Young climber up of knees, When I forget thy thousand ways, Then life and all shall cease. THE TWO BOYS. I saw a boy with eager eye Open a book upon a stall, And read as he'd devour it all: Which when the stall-man did espy, Soon to the boy I heard him call, “You, sir, you never buy a book, Therefore in one you shall not look.” The boy passed slowly on, and with a sigh He wished he never had been taught to read, Then of the old churl's books he should have had no need. Of sufferings the poor have many, Which never can the rich annoy. I soon perceived another boy Who looked as if he'd not had any Food for that day at least, enjoy The sight of cold meat in a tavern-larder. This boy's case, thought I, is surely harder, Thus hungry longing, thus without a penny, Beholding choice of dainty dressed meat: No wonder if he wish he ne'er had learned to eat. THE OFFER. “Tell me, would you rather be Changed by a fairy to the fine Young orphan heiress Geraldine, Or still be Emily? “Consider, ere you answer me, How many blessings are procured By riches, and how much endured By chilling poverty.” After a pause, said Emily: “In the words orphan heiress I Find many a solid reason why I would not changëd be. “What though I live in poverty, And have of sisters eight—so many, That few indulgencies, if any, Fall to the share of me: “Think you that for wealth I'd be Of even the least of them bereft, Or lose my parent, and be left An orphaned Emily? “Still should I be Emily, Although I looked like Geraldine; I feel within this heart of mine No change could workëd be.” THE SISTER'S EXPOSTULATION ON THE BROTHER'S LEARNING LATIN. Shut these odious books up, brother; They have made you quite another Thing from what you used to be: Once you liked to play with me, Now you leave me all alone, And are so conceited grown With your Latin, you'll scarce look Upon any English book. We had used on winter eves To con over Shakespeare's leaves, Or on Milton's harder sense Exercise our diligence— And you would explain with ease The obscurer passages, Find me out the prettiest places, The poetic turns, and graces, Which, alas! now you are gone, I must puzzle out alone, And oft miss the meaning quite, Wanting you to set me right. All this comes since you've been under Your new master. I much wonder What great charm it is you see In those words, musa, musæ; Or in what they do excel Our word, song. It sounds as well To my fancy as the other. Now believe me, dearest brother, I would give my finest frock, And my cabinet, and stock Of new playthings, every toy, I would give them all with joy Could I you returning see Back to English and to me. THE BROTHER'S REPLY. Sister, fie, for shame, no more, Give this ignorant babble o'er, Nor with little female pride Things above your sense deride. Why this foolish under-rating Of my first attempts at Latin? Know you not each thing we prize Does from small beginnings rise? 'Twas the same thing with your writing, Which you now take such delight in. First you learnt the down-stroke line, Then the hair-stroke thin and fine, Then a curve, and then a better, Till you came to form a letter; Then a new task was begun, How to join them two in one; Till you got (these first steps past) To your fine text-hand at last. So though I at first commence With the humble accidence, And my study's course affords Little else as yet but words, I shall venture in a while At construction, grammar, style, Learn my syntax, and proceed Classic authors next to read, Such as wiser, better, make us, Sallust, Phædrus, Ovid, Flaccus: All the poets (with their wit), All the grave historians writ, Who the lives and actions show Of men famous long ago; Even their very sayings giving In the tongue they used when living. Think not I shall do that wrong Either to my native tongue, English authors to despise, Or those books which you so prize; Though from them awhile I stray, By new studies called away, Them when next I take in hand, I shall better understand. For I've heard wise men declare Many words in English are From the Latin tongue derived, Of whose sense girls are deprived 'Cause they do not Latin know.— But if all this anger grow From this cause, that you suspect By proceedings indirect, I would keep (as misers pelf) All this learning to myself; Sister, to remove this doubt, Rather than we will fall out, (If our parents will agree) You shall Latin learn with me. NURSE GREEN. “Your prayers you have said, and you've wished good night: What cause is there yet keeps my darling awake? This throb in your bosom proclaims some affright Disturbs your composure. Can innocence quake? “Why thus do you cling to my neck, and enfold me, What fear unimparted your quiet devours?” “O mother, there's reason—for Susan has told me, A dead body lies in the room next to ours.” “I know it; and, but for forgetfulness, dear, I meant you the coffin this day should have seen, And read the inscription, and told me the year And day of the death of your poor old Nurse Green.” “O not for the wealth of the world would I enter A chamber wherein a dead body lay hid, Lest somebody bolder than I am should venture To go near the coffin and lift up the lid.” “And should they do so and the coffin uncover, The corpse underneath it would be no ill sight; This frame, when its animal functions are over, Has nothing of horror the living to fright. To start at the dead is preposterous error, To shrink from a foe that can never contest; Shall that which is motionless move thee to terror; Or thou become restless, 'cause they are at rest? To think harm of her our good feelings forbid us By whom when a babe you were dandled and fed; Who living so many good offices did us, I ne'er can persuade me would hurt us when dead. But if no endeavour your terrors can smother, If vainly against apprehension you strive, Come, bury your fears in the arms of your mother; My darling, cling close to me, I am alive.” GOOD TEMPER. In whatsoever place resides Good Temper, she o'er all presides; The most obdurate heart she guides. Even Anger yields unto her power, And sullen Spite forgets to lower, Or reconcilëd weeps a shower; Reserve she softens into Ease, Makes Fretfulness leave off to tease, She Waywardness itself can please. Her handmaids they are not a few: Sincerity that's ever true, And prompt Obedience always new, Urbanity that ever smiles, And Frankness that ne'er useth wiles, And Friendliness that ne'er beguiles, And Firmness that is always ready To make young good-resolves more steady, The only safeguard of the giddy; And blushing Modesty, and sweet Humility in fashion neat; Yet still her train is incomplete, Unless meek Piety attend Good Temper as her surest friend, Abiding with her to the end. MODERATION IN DIET. The drunkard's sin, excess in wine, Which reason drowns, and health destroys, As yet no failing is of thine, Dear Jim; strong drink's not given to boys. You from the cool fresh stream allay Those thirsts which sultry suns excite; When choked with dust, or hot with play, A cup of water yields delight. And reverence still that temperate cup, And cherish long the blameless taste; To learn the faults of men grown up, Dear Jim, be wise and do not haste. They'll come too soon.—But there's a vice, That shares the world's contempt no less; To be in eating over-nice, Or to court surfeits by excess. The first, as finical, avoid; The last is proper to a swine: By temperance meat is best enjoyed; Think of this maxim when you dine. Prefer with plain food to be fed, Rather than what are dainties styled; A sweet tooth in an infant's head Is pardoned, not in a grown child. If parent, aunt, or liberal friend, With splendid shilling line your purse, Do not the same on sweetmeats spend, Nor appetite with pampering nurse. Go buy a book; a dainty eaten Is vanished, and no sweets remain; They who their minds with knowledge sweeten, The savour long as life retain. Purchase some toy; a horse of wood, A pasteboard ship; their structure scan; Their mimic uses understood The school-boy make a kind of man. Go see some show; pictures or prints; Or beasts far brought from Indian land; Those foreign sights oft furnish hints, That may the youthful mind expand. And something of your store impart, To feed the poor and hungry soul; What buys for you the needless tart, May purchase him a needful roll. INCORRECT SPEAKING. Incorrectness in your speech Carefully avoid, my Anna; Study well the sense of each Sentence, lest in any manner It misrepresent the truth; Veracity's the charm of youth. You will not, I know, tell lies, If you know what you are speaking. Truth is shy, and from us flies; Unless diligently seeking Into every word we pry, Falsehood will her place supply. Falsehood is not shy, not she,— Ever ready to take place of Truth, too oft we Falsehood see, Or at least some latent trace of Falsehood, in the incorrect Words of those who Truth respect. CHARITY. O why your good deeds with such pride do you scan, And why that self-satisfied smile At the shilling you gave to the poor working man, That lifted you over the stile? 'Tis not much; all the bread that can with it be bought, Will scarce give a morsel to each Of his eight hungry children;—reflection and thought Should you more humility teach. Vainglory's a worm which the very best action Will taint, and its soundness eat through; But to give one's self airs for a small benefaction, Is folly and vanity too. The money perhaps by your father or mother Was furnished you but with that view; If so, you were only the steward of another, And the praise you usurp is their due. Perhaps every shilling you give in this way Is paid back with two by your friends; Then the bounty you so ostentatious display, Has little and low selfish ends. But if every penny you gave were your own, And giving diminished your purse; By a child's slender means think how little is done, And how little for it you're the worse. You eat, and you drink; when you rise in the morn, You are clothed; you have health and content; And you never have known, from the day you were born, What hunger or nakedness meant. The most which your bounty from you can subtract Is an apple, a sweetmeat, a toy; For so easy a virtue, so trifling an act, You are paid with an innocent joy. Give thy bread to the hungry, the thirsty thy cup; Divide with the afflicted thy lot: This can only be practised by persons grown up, Who've possessions which children have not. Having two cloaks, give one (said our Lord) to the poor; In such bounty as that lies the trial: But a child that gives half of its infantile store Has small praise, because small self-denial. MY BIRTHDAY. A dozen years since in this house what commotion, What bustle, what stir, and what joyful ado; Every soul in the family at my devotion, When into the world I came twelve years ago. I've been told by my friends (if they do not belie me) My promise was such as no parent would scorn; The wise and the aged who prophesied by me Augured nothing but good of me when I was born. But vain are the hopes which are formed by a parent, Fallacious the marks which in infancy shine; My frail constitution soon made it apparent, I nourished within me the seeds of decline. On a sick bed I lay, through the flesh my bones started, My grief-wasted frame to a skeleton fell; My physicians foreboding took leave and departed, And they wished me dead now, who wishëd me well. Life and soul were kept in by a mother's assistance, Who struggled with faith, and prevailed 'gainst despair; Like an angel she watched o'er the lamp of existence, And never would leave while a glimmer was there. By her care I'm alive now—but what retribution Can I for a life twice bestowed thus confer? Were I to be silent, each year's revolution Proclaims—each new birthday is owing to her. The chance-rooted tree that by waysides is planted, Where no friendly hand will watch o'er its young shoots, Has less blame if in autumn, when produce is wanted, Enriched by small culture it put forth small fruits. But that which with labour in hot-beds is reared, Secured by nice art from the dews and the rains, Unsound at the root may with justice be feared, If it pay not with interest the tiller's hard pains. THE BEASTS IN THE TOWER. Within the precincts of this yard, Each in his narrow confines barred, Dwells every beast that can be found On Afric or on Indian ground. How different was the life they led In those wild haunts where they were bred, To this tame servitude and fear, Enslaved by man, they suffer here! In that uneasy close recess Couches a sleeping lioness; That next den holds a bear; the next A wolf, by hunger ever vext; There, fiercer from the keeper's lashes His teeth the fell hyena gnashes; That creature on whose back abound Black spots upon a yellow ground, A panther is, the fairest beast That haunteth in the spacious East. He underneath a fair outside Does cruelty and treachery hide. That cat-like beast that to and fro Restless as fire does ever go, As if his courage did resent His limbs in such confinement pent, That should their prey in forests take, And make the Indian jungles quake, A tiger is. Observe how sleek And glossy smooth his coat: no streak On satin ever matched the pride Of that which marks his furry hide. How strong his muscles! he with ease Upon the tallest man could seize, In his large mouth away could bear him, And into thousand pieces tear him: Yet cabined so securely here, The smallest infant need not fear. That lordly creature next to him A lion is. Survey each limb. Observe the texture of his claws, The massy thickness of those jaws; His mane that sweeps the ground in length, Like Samson's locks, betokening strength. In force and swiftness he excels Each beast that in the forest dwells; The savage tribes him king confess Throughout the howling wilderness. Woe to the hapless neighbourhood, When he is pressed by want of food! Of man, or child, of bull, or horse, He makes his prey; such is his force. A waste behind him he creates, Whole villages depopulates. Yet here within appointed lines How small a grate his rage confines! This place methinks resembleth well The world itself in which we dwell. Perils and snares on every ground Like these wild beasts beset us round. But Providence their rage restrains, Our heavenly Keeper sets them chains; His goodness saveth every hour His darlings from the lion's power. THE CONFIDANT. Anna was always full of thought As if she'd many sorrows known, Yet mostly her full heart was fraught With troubles that were not her own; For the whole school to Anna used to tell Whatever small misfortunes unto them befell. And being so by all beloved, That all into her bosom poured Their dearest secrets, she was moved To pity all—her heart a hoard, Or storehouse, by this means became for all The sorrows can to girls of tender age befall. Though individually not much Distress throughout the school prevailed, Yet as she shared it all, 'twas such A weight of woe that her assailed, She lost her colour, loathed her food, and grew So dull, that all their confidence from her withdrew. Releasëd from her daily care, No longer listening to complaint, She seems to breathe a different air, And health once more her cheek does paint. Still Anna loves her friends, but will not hear Again their list of grievances which cost so dear. THOUGHTLESS CRUELTY. There, Robert, you have killed that fly, And should you thousand ages try The life you've taken to supply, You could not do it. You surely must have been devoid Of thought and sense, to have destroyed A thing which no way you annoyed— You'll one day rue it. 'Twas but a fly perhaps you'll say, That's born in April, dies in May; That does but just learn to display His wings one minute, And in the next is vanished quite: A bird devours it in his flight, Or come a cold blast in the night, There's no breath in it. The bird but seeks his proper food; And Providence, whose power endued That fly with life, when it thinks good, May justly take it. But you have no excuses for't; A life by Nature made so short, Less reason is that you for sport Should shorter make it. A fly a little thing you rate, But, Robert, do not estimate A creature's pain by small or great; The greatest being Can have but fibres, nerves, and flesh, And these the smallest ones possess, Although their frame and structure less Escape our seeing. EYES. Lucy, what do you espy In the cast in Jenny's eye That should you to laughter move? I far other feelings prove. When on me she does advance Her good-natured countenance, And those eyes which in their way Saying much, so much would say, They to me no blemish seem, Or as none I them esteem; I their imperfection prize Above other clearer eyes. Eyes do not as jewels go By the brightness and the show, But the meanings which surround them, And the sweetness shines around them. Isabel's are black as jet, But she cannot that forget, And the pains she takes to show them Robs them of the praise we owe them. Ann's, though blue, affected fall; Kate's are bright, and fierce withal; And the sparklers of her sister From ill-humour lose their lustre. Only Jenny's eyes we see, By their very plainness, free From the vices which do smother All the beauties of the other. PENNY PIECES. “I keep it, dear papa, within my glove.” “You do—what sum then usually, my love, Is there deposited? I make no doubt, Some penny pieces you are not without.” “O no, papa, they'd soil my glove, and be Quite odious things to carry. O no—see, This little bit of gold is surely all That I shall want; for I shall only call For a small purchase I shall make, papa, And a mere trifle I'm to buy mamma; Just to make out the change: so there's no need To carry penny pieces, sir, indeed.” “O now I know then why a blind man said Unto a dog which this blind beggar led,— ‘Where'er you see some fine young ladies, Tray, Be sure you lead me quite another way. The poor man's friend fair ladies used to be; But now I find no tale of misery Will ever from their pockets draw a penny:’ The blind man did not see they wear not any.” THE RAINBOW. After the tempest in the sky How sweet yon rainbow to the eye! Come, my Matilda, now while some Few drops of rain are yet to come, In this honeysuckle bower Safely sheltered from the shower, We may count the colours o'er.— Seven there are, there are no more; Each in each so finely blended, Where they begin, or where are ended, The finest eye can scarcely see. A fixed thing it seems to be; But, while we speak, see how it glides Away, and now observe it hides Half of its perfect arch—now we Scarce any part of it can see. What is colour? If I were A natural philosopher, I would tell you what does make This meteor every colour take: But an unlearned eye may view Nature's rare sights, and love them too. Whenever I a rainbow see, Each precious tint is dear to me; For every colour find I there, Which flowers, which fields, which ladies wear: My favourite green, the grass's hue, And the fine deep violet-blue, And the pretty pale blue-bell, And the rose I love so well, All the wondrous variations Of the tulips, pinks, carnations, This woodbine here both flower and leaf. 'Tis a truth that's past belief, That every flower and every tree, And every living thing we see, Every face which we espy, Every cheek and every eye, In all their tints, in every shade, Are from the rainbow's colours made. THE FORCE OF HABIT. A little child, who had desired To go and see the Park guns fired, Was taken by his maid that way Upon the next rejoicing day. Soon as the unexpected stroke Upon his tender organs broke, Confused and stunned at the report, He to her arms fled for support, And begged to be conveyed at once Out of the noise of those great guns, Those naughty guns, whose only sound Would kill (he said) without a wound: So much of horror and offence The shock had given his infant sense. Yet this was he in after days Who filled the world with martial praise, When from the English quarter-deck His steady courage swayed the wreck Of hostile fleets, disturbed no more By all that vast conflicting roar, That sky and sea did seem to tear, When vessels whole blew up in air, Than at the smallest breath that heaves, When Zephyr hardly stirs the leaves. CLOCK STRIKING. Did I hear the church-clock a few minutes ago, I was asked, and I answered, I hardly did know, But I thought that I heard it strike three. Said my friend then, “The blessings we always possess We know not the want of, and prize them the less; The church-clock was no new sound to thee. “A young woman, afflicted with deafness a year, By that sound you scarce heard, first perceived she could hear; I was near her, and saw the girl start With such exquisite wonder, such feelings of pride, A happiness almost to terror allied, She showed the sound went to her heart.” WHY NOT DO IT, SIR, TO-DAY? “Why so I will, you noisy bird, This very day I'll advertise you, Perhaps some busy ones may prize you. A fine-tongued parrot as was ever heard, I'll word it thus—set forth all charms about you, And say no family should be without you.” Thus far a gentleman addressed a bird, Then to his friend: “An old procrastinator, Sir, I am: do you wonder that I hate her? Though she but seven words can say, Twenty and twenty times a day She interferes with all my dreams, My projects, plans, and airy schemes, Mocking my foible to my sorrow: I'll advertise this bird to-morrow.” To this the bird seven words did say: “Why not do it, sir, to-day?” HOME DELIGHTS. To operas and balls my cousins take me, And fond of plays my new-made friend would make me. In summer season, when the days are fair, In my godmother's coach I take the air. My uncle has a stately pleasure barge, Gilded and gay, adorned with wondrous charge; The mast is polished, and the sails are fine, The awnings of white silk like silver shine; The seats of crimson satin, where the rowers Keep time to music with their painted oars; In this on holidays we oft resort To Richmond, Twickenham, or to Hampton Court. By turns we play, we sing—one baits the hook, Another angles—some more idle look At the small fry that sport beneath the tides, Or at the swan that on the surface glides. My married sister says there is no feast Equal to sight of foreign bird or beast. With her in search of these I often roam: My kinder parents make me blest at home. Tired of excursions, visitings, and sights, No joys are pleasing to these home delights. THE COFFEE SLIPS. Whene'er I fragrant coffee drink, I on the generous Frenchman think, Whose noble perseverance bore The tree to Martinico's shore. While yet her colony was new, Her island products but a few, Two shoots from off a coffee-tree He carried with him o'er the sea. Each little tender coffee slip He waters daily in the ship, And as he tends his embryo trees, Feels he is raising midst the seas Coffee groves, whose ample shade Shall screen the dark Creolian maid. But soon, alas! his darling pleasure In watching this his precious treasure Is like to fade,—for water fails On board the ship in which he sails. Now all the reservoirs are shut, The crew on short allowance put; So small a drop is each man's share, Few leavings you may think there are To water these poor coffee plants;— But he supplies their gasping wants, Even from his own dry parchëd lips He spares it for his coffee slips. Water he gives his nurslings first, Ere he allays his own deep thirst Lest, if he first the water sip, He bear too far his eager lip. He sees them droop for want of more;— Yet when they reach the destined shore, With pride the heroic gardener sees A living sap still in his trees. The islanders his praise resound; Coffee plantations rise around; And Martinico loads her ships With produce from those dear-saved slips. The name of this man was Desclieux, and the story is to be found in the Abbé Raynal's History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies, book xiii. THE DESSERT. With the apples and the plums Little Carolina comes, At the time of the dessert she Comes and drops her last new curtsy; Graceful curtsy, practised o'er In the nursery before. What shall we compare her to? The dessert itself will do. Like preserves she's kept with care, Like blanched almonds she is fair, Soft as down on peach her hair, And so soft, so smooth is each Pretty cheek as that same peach, Yet more like in hue to cherries; Then her lips, the sweet strawberries, Caroline herself shall try them If they are not like when nigh them; Her bright eyes are black as sloes, But I think we've none of those Common fruit here—and her chin From a round point does begin, Like the small end of a pear; Whiter drapery she does wear Than the frost on cake; and sweeter Than the cake itself, and neater, Though bedecked with emblems fine, Is our little Caroline. TO A YOUNG LADY, ON BEING TOO FOND OF MUSIC. Why is your mind thus all day long Upon your music set; Till reason's swallowed in a song, Or idle canzonet? I grant you, Melesinda, when Your instrument was new, I was well pleased to see you then Its charms assiduous woo. The rudiments of any art Or mastery that we try, Are only on the learner's part Got by hard industry. But you are past your first essays; Whene'er you play, your touch, Skilful and light, ensures you praise: All beyond that's too much. Music's sweet uses are, to smooth Each rough and angry passion; To elevate at once, and soothe: A heavenly recreation. But we misconstrue, and defeat The end of any good; When what should be our casual treat, We make our constant food. While, to the exclusion of the rest, This single art you ply, Your nobler studies are supprest, Your books neglected lie. Could you in what you so affect The utmost summit reach; Beyond what fondest friends expect, Or skilfullest masters teach: The skill you learned would not repay The time and pains it cost, Youth's precious season thrown away, And reading-leisure lost. A benefit to books we owe Music can ne'er dispense; The one does only sound bestow, The other gives us sense. TIME SPENT IN DRESS. In many a lecture, many a book, You all have heard, you all have read, That time is precious. Of its use Much has been written, much been said. The accomplishments which gladden life, As music, drawing, dancing, are Encroachers on our precious time; Their praise or dispraise I forbear. They should be practised or forborne, As parents wish, or friends desire: What rests alone in their own will Is all I of the young require. There's not a more productive source Of waste of time to the young mind Than dress; as it regards our hours My view of it is now confined. Without some calculation, youth May live to age and never guess, That no one study they pursue Takes half the time they give to dress. Write in your memorandum-book The time you at your toilette spend; Then every moment which you pass, Talking of dress with a young friend: And ever when your silent thoughts Have on this subject been intent, Set down as nearly as you can How long on dress your thoughts were bent. If faithfully you should perform This task, 'twould teach you to repair Lost hours, by giving unto dress Not more of time than its due share. THE FAIRY. Said Ann to Matilda, “I wish that we knew If what we've been reading of fairies be true. Do you think that the poet himself had a sight of The fairies he here does so prettily write of? O what a sweet sight if he really had seen The graceful Titania, the Fairy-land Queen! If I had such dreams, I would sleep a whole year; I would not wish to wake while a fairy was near.— Now I'll fancy that I in my sleep have been seeing A fine little delicate lady-like being, Whose steps and whose motions so light were and airy, I knew at one glance that she must be a fairy. Her eyes they were blue, and her fine curling hair Of the lightest of browns, her complexion more fair Than I e'er saw a woman's; and then for her height, I verily think that she measured not quite Two feet, yet so justly proportioned withal, I was almost persuaded to think she was tall. Her voice was the little thin note of a sprite— There—d'ye think I have made out a fairy aright? You'll confess, I believe, I've not done it amiss.” “Pardon me,” said Matilda, “I find in all this Fine description, you've only your young sister Mary Been taking a copy of here for a fairy.” CONQUEST OF PREJUDICE. Unto a Yorkshire school was sent A negro youth to learn to write, And the first day young Juba went All gazed on him as a rare sight. But soon with altered looks askance They view his sable face and form, When they perceive the scornful glance Of the head boy, young Henry Orme. He in the school was first in fame: Said he, “It does to me appear To be a great disgrace and shame A black should be admitted here.” His words were quickly whispered round, And every boy now looks offended; The master saw the change, and found That Orme a mutiny intended. Said he to Orme, “This African It seems is not by you approved; I'll find a way, young Englishman, To have this prejudice removed. “Nearer acquaintance possibly May make you tolerate his hue; At least 'tis my intent to try What a short month may chance to do.” Young Orme and Juba then he led Into a room, in which there were For each of the two boys a bed, A table, and a wicker chair. He locked them in, secured the key, That all access to them was stopt; They from without can nothing see; Their food is through a skylight dropt. A month in this lone chamber Orme Is sentenced during all that time To view no other face or form Than Juba's parched by Afric clime. One word they neither of them spoke The first three days of the first week; On the fourth day the ice was broke; Orme was the first that deigned to speak. The dreary silence o'er, both glad To hear of human voice the sound, The negro and the English lad Comfort in mutual converse found. Of ships and seas and foreign coast Juba can speak, for he has been A voyager: and Orme can boast He London's famous town has seen. In eager talk they pass the day, And borrow hours even from the night; So pleasantly time passed away, That they have lost their reckoning quite. And when their master set them free, They thought a week was sure remitted, And thanked him that their liberty Had been before the time permitted. Now Orme and Juba are good friends; The school, by Orme's example won, Contend who most shall make amends For former slights to Afric's son. THE GREAT GRANDFATHER. My father's grandfather lives still, His age is fourscore years and ten; He looks a monument of time, The agedest of aged men. Though years lie on him like a load, A happier man you will not see Than he, whenever he can get His great grandchildren on his knee. When we our parents have displeased, He stands between us as a screen; By him our good deeds in the sun, Our bad ones in the shade are seen. His love's a line that's long drawn out, Yet lasteth firm unto the end; His heart is oak, yet unto us It like the gentlest reed can bend. A fighting soldier he has been— Yet by his manners you would guess, That he his whole long life had spent In scenes of country quietness. His talk is all of things long past, For modern facts no pleasure yield— Of the famed year of forty-five, Of William, and Culloden's field. The deeds of this eventful age, Which princes from their thrones have hurled, Can no more interest wake in him Than stories of another world. When I his length of days revolve, How like a strong tree he hath stood, It brings into my mind almost Those patriarchs old before the flood. THE SPARTAN BOY. When I the memory repeat Of the heroic actions great, Which, in contempt of pain and death, Were done by men who drew their breath In ages past, I find no deed That can in fortitude exceed The noble boy, in Sparta bred, Who in the temple ministered. By the sacrifice he stands, The lighted incense in his hands. Through the smoking censer's lid Dropped a burning coal, which slid Into his sleeve, and passëd in Between the folds even to the skin. Dire was the pain which then he proved; But not for this his sleeve he moved, Or would the scorching ember shake Out from the folds, lest it should make Any confusion, or excite Disturbance at the sacred rite. But close he kept the burning coal, Till it eat itself a hole In his flesh. The standers by Saw no sign, and heard no cry, Of his pangs had no discerning, Till they smelled the flesh a-burning. All this he did in noble scorn, And for he was a Spartan born. Young student, who this story readest, And with the same thy thoughts now feedest, Thy weaker nerves might thee forbid To do the thing the Spartan did; Thy feebler heart could not sustain Such dire extremity of pain. But in this story thou mayst see, What may useful prove to thee. By his example thou wilt find, That to the ingenuous mind Shame can greater anguish bring Than the body's suffering; That pain is not the worst of ills, Not when it the body kills; That in fair religion's cause, For thy country, or the laws, When occasion due shall offer, 'Tis reproachful not to suffer. If thou shouldst a soldier be, And a wound should trouble thee, If without the soldier's fame Thou to chance shouldst owe a maim, Do not for a little pain On thy manhood bring a stain; But to keep thy spirits whole, Think on the Spartan and the coal. ON A PICTURE OF THE FINDING OF MOSES BY PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER. This picture does the story express Of Moses in the bulrushes. How livelily the painter's hand By colours makes us understand! Moses that little infant is. This figure is his sister. This Fine stately lady is no less A personage than a princess, Daughter of Pharaoh, Egypt's king; Whom Providence did hither bring This little Hebrew child to save. See how near the perilous wave He lies exposëd in the ark, His rushy cradle, his frail bark! Pharaoh, king of Egypt land, In his greatness gave command To his slaves, they should destroy Every new-born Hebrew boy. This Moses was an Hebrew's son. When he was born, his birth to none His mother told, to none revealed, But kept her goodly child concealed. Three months she hid him; then she wrought With bulrushes this ark, and brought Him in it to this river's side, Carefully looking far and wide To see that no Egyptian eye Her ark-hid treasure should espy. Among the river-flags she lays The child. Near him his sister stays. We may imagine her affright, When the king's daughter is in sight. Soon the princess will perceive The ark among the flags, and give Command to her attendant maid That its contents shall be displayed. Within the ark the child is found, And now he utters mournful sound. Behold he weeps, as if he were Afraid of cruel Egypt's heir! She speaks, she says, “This little one I will protect, though he the son Be of an Hebrew.” Every word She speaks is by the sister heard.— And now observe, this is the part The painter chose to show his art. Look at the sister's eager eye, As here she seems advancing nigh. Lowly she bends, says, “Shall I go And call a nurse to thee? I know A Hebrew woman liveth near, Great lady, shall I bring her here?” See! Pharaoh's daughter answers, “Go.”— No more the painter's art can show. He cannot make his figures move.— On the light wings of swiftest love The girl will fly to bring the mother To be the nurse, she'll bring no other. To her will Pharaoh's daughter say, “Take this child from me away: For wages nurse him. To my home At proper age this child may come. When to our palace he is brought, Wise masters shall for him be sought To train him up, befitting one I would protect as my own son. And Moses be a name unto him, Because I from the waters drew him.” DAVID. It is not always to the strong Victorious battle shall belong. This found Goliath huge and tall: Mightiest giant of them all, Who in the proud Philistian host Defiëd Israel with boast. With loud voice Goliath said: “Hear, armed Israel, gatherëd, And in array against us set: Ye shall alone by me be met. For am not I a Philistine? What strength may be compared to mine? “Choose ye a man of greatest might: And if he conquer me in fight, Then we will all servants be, King of Israel, unto thee. But if I prove the victor, then Shall Saul and all his armëd men Bend low beneath Philistian yoke.” Day by day these words he spoke, Singly traversing the ground. But not an Israelite was found To combat man to man with him, Who such prodigious force of limb Displayed. Like to a weaver's beam The ponderous spear he held did seem. In height six cubits he did pass, And he was armed all o'er in brass. Him we will leave awhile, and speak Of one, the soft down on whose cheek Of tender youth the tokens bare. Ruddy he was and very fair. David, the son of Jesse he, Small sized, yet beautiful to see. Three brothers had he in the band Of warriors under Saul's command; Himself at home did private keep In Bethlem's plains his father's sheep. Jesse said to this his son: “David, to thy brothers run, Where in the camp they now abide, And learn what of them may betide. These presents for their captains take, And of their fare inquiries make.” With joy the youth his sire obeyed.— David was no whit dismayed When he arrivëd at the place Where he beheld the strength and face Of dread Goliath, and could hear The challenge. Of the people near Unmoved he asked, what should be done To him who slew that boasting one, Whose words such mischiefs did forebode To the armies of the living God? “The king,” they unto David say, “Most amply will that man repay. He and his father's house shall be Evermore in Israel free. With mighty wealth Saul will endow That man: and he has made a vow; Whoever takes Goliath's life, Shall have Saul's daughter for his wife.” His eldest brother, who had heard His question, was to anger stirred Against the youth: for (as he thought) Things out of his young reach he sought. Said he, “What moved thee to come here, To question warlike men? say, where And in whose care are those few sheep That in the wilderness you keep? I know thy thoughts, how proud thou art: In the naughtiness of thy heart, Hoping a battle thou mayst see, Thou comest hither down to me.” Then answered Jesse's youngest son In these words: “What have I done? Is there not cause?” Some there which heard, And at the manner of his word Admired, report this to the king. By his command they David bring Into his presence. Fearless then, Before the king and his chief men, He shows his confident design To combat with the Philistine. Saul with wonder heard the youth, And thus addressed him: “Of a truth, No power thy untried sinew hath To cope with this great man of Gath.” Lowly David bowed his head, And with firm voice the stripling said: “Thy servant kept his father's sheep.— Rushing from a mountain steep There came a lion, and a bear, The firstlings of my flock to tear. Thy servant hath that lion killed, And killed that bear, when from the field Two young lambs by force they seized. The Lord was mercifully pleased Me to deliver from the paw Of the fierce bear, and cruel jaw Of the strong lion. I shall slay The unrighteous Philistine this day, If God deliver him also To me.” He ceased. The king said, “Go: Thy God, the God of Israel, be In the battle still with thee.” David departs unarmed, save A staff in hand he chanced to have. Nothing to the fight he took, Save five smooth stones from out a brook; These in his shepherd's scrip he placed, That was fastened round his waist. With staff and sling alone he meets The armëd giant, who him greets With nought but scorn. Looking askance On the fair ruddy countenance Of his young enemy—“Am I A dog, that thou comest here to try Thy strength upon me with a staff?” Goliath said with scornful laugh. “Thou comest with sword, with spear, with shield, Yet thou to me this day must yield. The Lord of Hosts is on my side, Whose armies boastful thou'st defied. All nations of the earth shall hear He saveth not with shield and spear.” Thus David spake, and nigher went, Then choosing from his scrip, he sent Out of his slender sling a stone.— The giant uttered fearful moan. The stone though small had piercëd deep Into his forehead, endless sleep Giving Goliath—and thus died Of Philistines the strength and pride. DAVID IN THE CAVE OF ADULLAM. David and his three captains bold Kept ambush once within a hold. It was in Adullam's cave, Nigh which no water they could have. Nor spring nor running brook was near To quench the thirst that parched them there. Then David king of Israel Straight bethought him of a well Which stood beside the city gate At Bethlem: where, before his state Of kingly dignity, he had Oft drunk his fill, a shepherd lad. But now his fierce Philistian foe Encamped before it he does know. Yet ne'er the less with heat opprest, Those three bold captains he addrest, And wished that one to him would bring Some water from his native spring. His valiant captains instantly To execute his will did fly. Those three brave men the ranks broke through Of armëd foes, and water drew For David, their belovëd king, At his own sweet native spring. Back through their enemies they haste, With the hard-earned treasure graced. What with such danger they had sought, With joy unto their king they brought. But when the good king David found What they had done, he on the ground The water poured, “Because,” said he, “That it was at the jeopardy Of your three lives this thing ye did, That I should drink it God forbid.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS POEMS, BY CHARLES LAMB. HITHERTO UNCOLLECTED. (1796–1832.) ON BEING ASKED TO WRITE IN MISS WESTWOOD'S ALBUM. My feeble Muse, that fain her best would Write, at command of Frances Westwood, But feels her wits not in their best mood, Fell lately on some idle fancies, As she's much given to romances, About this self-same style of Frances; Which seems to be a name in common Attributed to man or woman. She thence contrived this flattering moral, With which she hopes no soul will quarrel, That she, whom this twin title decks, Combines what's good in either sex; Unites—how very rare the case is!— Masculine sense to female graces; And, quitting not her proper rank, Is both in one—Fanny and frank.

Enfield, January, 1830. THE FIRST LEAF OF SPRING. WRITTEN ON THE FIRST LEAF OF A LADY'S ALBUM. Thou fragile, filmy, gossamery thing, First leaf of spring! At every lightest breath that quakest, And with a zephyr shakest; Scarce stout enough to hold thy slender form together In calmest halcyon weather: Next sister to the web that spiders weave, Poor flutterers to deceive Into their treacherous silken bed: O! how art thou sustained, how nourishëd! All trivial as thou art, Without dispute, Thou play'st a mighty part; And art the herald to a throng Of buds, blooms, fruit, That shall thy cracking branches sway, While birds on every spray Shall pay the copious fruitage with a sylvan song. So 'tis with thee, whoe'er on thee shall look, First leaf of this beginning modest book. Slender thou art, God knowest, And little grace bestowest, But in thy train shall follow after, Wit, wisdom, seriousness, in hand with laughter; Provoking jests, restraining soberness, In their appropriate dress; And I shall joy to be outdone By those who brighter trophies won, Without a grief, That I thy slender promise have begun, First leaf. 1832. THE APE. To the Editor [of the “London Magazine”]. Mr. Editor,—The riddling lines which I send you, were written upon a young lady who, from her diverting sportiveness in childhood, was named by her friends The Ape. When the verses were written, L. M. had outgrown the title—but not the memory of it—being in her teens, and consequently past child-tricks. They are an endeavour to express that perplexity which one feels at any alteration, even supposed for the better, in a beloved object; with a little oblique grudging at Time, who cannot bestow new graces without taking away some portion of the older ones, which we can ill miss. An Ape is but a trivial beast, Men count it light and vain; But I would let them have their thoughts, To have my Ape again. To love a beast in any sort Is no great sign of grace; But I have loved a flouting Ape's 'Bove any lady's face. I have known the power of two fair eyes, In smile or else in glance, And how (for I a lover was) They make the spirits dance; But I would give two hundred smiles Of them that fairest be, For one look of my staring Ape That used to stare on me. This beast, this Ape, it had a face— If face it might be styled— Sometimes it was a staring Ape, Sometimes a beauteous child— A Negro flat—a Pagod squat, Cast in a Chinese mould— And then it was a Cherub's face Made of the beaten gold! But Time, that's meddling, meddling still, And always altering things— And what's already at the best To alteration brings, That turns the sweetest buds to flowers, And chops and changes toys, That breaks up dreams, and parts old friends, And still commutes our joys— Has changed away my Ape at last And in its place conveyed, Thinking therewith to cheat my sight, A fresh and blooming maid! And fair to sight is she—and still Each day doth sightlier grow, Upon the ruins of the Ape, My ancient playfellow! The tale of Sphinx, and Theban jests I true in me perceive; I suffer riddles; death from dark Enigmas I receive: Whilst a hid being I pursue, That lurks in a new shape, My darling in herself I miss, And, in my ape, the ape. 1806. PROLOGUE TO FAULKENER: A TRAGEDY BY WILLIAM GODWIN, 1807. An author who has given you all delight Furnished the tale our stage presents to-night. Some of our earliest tears he taught to steal Down our young cheeks, and forced us first to feel. To solitary shores whole years confined, Who has not read how pensive Crusoe pined? Who, now grown old, that did not once admire His goat, his parrot, his uncouth attire, The stick, due-notched, that told each tedious day That in the lonely island wore away? Who has not shuddered, where he stands aghast At sight of human footsteps in the waste? Or joyed not, when his trembling hands unbind Thee, Friday, gentlest of the savage kind? The genius who conceived that magic tale Was skilled by native pathos to prevail. His stories, though rough-drawn and framed in haste, Had that which pleased our homely grandsires' taste. His was a various pen, that freely roved Into all subjects, was in most approved. Whate'er the theme, his ready Muse obeyed— Love, courtship, politics, religion, trade— Gifted alike to shine in every sphere, Novelist, historian, poet, pamphleteer. In some blest interval of party-strife, He drew a striking sketch from private life, Whose moving scenes of intricate distress We try to-night in a dramatic dress: A real story of domestic woe, That asks no aid from music, verse, or show, But trusts to truth, to Nature, and Defoe. TO THE POET COWPER, ON HIS RECOVERY FROM AN INDISPOSITION. WRITTEN SOME TIME BACK. Cowper, I thank my God that thou art healed. Thine was the sorest malady of all, And I am sad to think that it should light Upon the worthy head; but thou art healed, And thou art yet, we trust, the destined man, Born to re-animate the lyre, whose chords Have slumbered, and have idle lain so long; To the immortal sounding of whose strings Did Milton frame the stately-paced verse; Among whose wires with lighter finger playing Our elder bard, Spenser, a gentler name, The lady Muses' dearest darling child, Enticëd forth the deftest tunes yet heard In hall or bower; taking the delicate ear Of the brave Sidney, and the Maiden Queen. Thou, then, take up the mighty epic strain, Cowper, of England's bards the wisest and the best! LINES ADDRESSED FROM LONDON, TO SARA AND S. T. C. AT BRISTOL, IN THE SUMMER OF 1796. Was it so hard a thing? I did but ask A fleeting holiday, a little week. What if the jaded steer who all day long Had borne the heat and burthen of the plough, When evening came, and her sweet cooling hour, Should seek to wander in a neighbour copse, Where greener herbage waved, or clearer streams Invited him to slake his burning thirst? The man were crabbed who should say him nay, The man were churlish who should drive him thence. A blessing light upon your worthy heads, Ye hospitable pair! I may not come To catch, on Clifden's heights, the summer gale; I may not come to taste the Avon wave; Or, with mine eye intent on Redcliffe towers, To muse in tears on that mysterious youth, Cruelly slighted, who, in evil hour, Shaped his adventurous course to London walls! Complaint, be gone! and, ominous thoughts, away! Take up, my song, take up a merrier strain; For yet again, and lo! from Avon's vales, Another minstrel “From vales where Avon winds, the minstrel came.” Coleridge's Monody on Chatterton. cometh. Youth endeared, God and good angels guide thee on thy road, And gentler fortunes wait the friends I love. SONNET TO A FRIEND. Friend of my earliest years and childish days, My joys, my sorrows, thou with me hast shared, Companion dear, and we alike have fared (Poor pilgrims we) through life's unequal ways; It were unwisely done, should we refuse To cheer our path as featly as we may, Our lonely path to cheer, as travellers use, With merry song, quaint tale, or roundelay; And we will sometimes talk past troubles o'er, Of mercies shown, and all our sickness healed, And in his judgments God remembering love; And we will learn to praise God evermore For those glad tidings of great joy revealed By that sooth messenger sent from above. SONNET. [The Lord of Life shakes off his drowsihed] The Lord of Life shakes off his drowsihed, And 'gins to sprinkle on the earth below Those rays that from his shaken locks do flow; Meantime, by truant love of rambling led, I turn my back on thy detested walls, Proud city! and thy sons I leave behind, A sordid, selfish, money-getting kind; Brute things, who shut their ears when Freedom calls. I pass not thee so lightly, well-known spire, That mindest me of many a pleasure gone, Of merrier days, of love and Islington; Kindling afresh the flames of past desire. And I shall muse on thee slow journeying on To the green plains of pleasant Hertfordshire. 1795. THE END.</field>
