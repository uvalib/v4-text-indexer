      <field name="fulltext">Volume the First Poems in Commendation of the Author. i. Clorus. [From the Poems. ?Edinburgh, ?1614.] Swanne which so sweetly sings, By Aska's Bancks, and pitifully plaines, That old Meander neuer heard such Straines, Eternall Fame, thou to thy Countrie brings: And now our Calidon Is by thy Songs made a new Helicon. Her Mountaines, Woods, and Springs, While Mountaines, Woods, Springs be, shall sound thy Praise, And though fierce Boreas oft made pale her Bayes, And kill those Mirtills with enraged Breath, Which should thy Browes enwreath; Her Floods haue Pearles, Seas Amber doe send foorth, Her Heauen hath golden Starres to crowne thy Woorth. ii. To the Author. [From the Poems, The Second Impression. Edinburgh, 1616.] While thou dost praise the Roses, Lilies, Gold, Which in a dangling Tresse and Face appeare, Still stands the Sunne in Skies thy Songs to heare, A Silence sweet each Whispering Wind doth hold; Sleepe in Pasitheas Lap his Eyes doth fold, The Sword falls from the God of the fift Spheare, The Heards to feede, the Birds to sing, forbeare, Each Plant breathes Loue, each Flood and Fountaine cold: And hence it is, that that once Nymphe, now Tree, Who did th' Amphrisian Shepheards Sighes disdaine, And scorn'd his Layes, mou'd by a sweeter Veine, Is become pittifull, and followes Thee: Thee loues, and vanteth that shee hath the Grace, A Garland for thy Lockes to enterlace. Parthenivs. To the Author. In Waues of Woe thy Sighes my Soule doe tosse, And doe burst vp the Conduits of my Teares, Whose ranckling Wound no smoothing Baulme long beares, But freshly bleedes when Ought vpbraides my Losse. Then thou so sweetly Sorrow makes to sing, And troubled Passions dost so well accord, That more Delight thine Anguish doth afford, Than others Ioyes can Satisfaction bring. What sacred Wits (when rauish'd) doe affect, To force Affections, metamorphose Mindes, Whilst numbrous Power the Soule in secret bindes, Thou hast perform'd, transforming in Effect: For neuer Plaints did greater Pittie moue, The best Applause that can such Notes approue. S?. W. Alexander. To the Author. The sister Nymphes who haunt the Thespian Springs, Ne're did their Gifts more liberally bequeath To them who on their Hills suck'd sacred Breath, Than vnto thee, by which thou sweetly sings. Ne're did Apollo raise on Pegase Wings A Muse more neare himselfe, more farre from Earth, Than thine; if Shee doe weepe thy Ladies Death, Or sing those sweet-sowre Panges which Passion brings. To write our Thoughts in Verse doth merite Praise, But those our Verse to gild in Fictions Ore, Bright, rich, delightfull, doth deserue much more, As thou hast done these thy delicious Layes: Thy Muses Morning (doubtlesse) doth bewray The neare Approach of a more glistring Day. D. Murray. iii. Vpon the incomparable Poems of Mr. William Drummond. [From Phillips's edition of the Poems. London, 1656.] To praise these Poems well, there doth require The selfe-same spirit, and that sacred fire That first inspir'd them; yet I cannot choose But pay an admiration to a Muse That sings such handsome things; never brake forth, From Climes so neare the Beare, so bright a worth; And I beleeve the Caledonian Bow'rs Are full as pleasant, and as rich in flow'rs As Tempe e're was fam'd, since they have nourish'd A wit the most sublime that ever flourish'd; There's nothing cold, or frozen, here contain'd, Nothing that's harsh, unpolish'd, or constrain'd, But such an ardour as creates the spring, And throws a chearfulnesse on every thing; Such a sweet calmnesse runs through every verse As shews how he delighted to converse With silence, and his Muse, among those shades Which care, nor busie tumult, e're invades; There would he oft, the adventures of his loves Relate unto the Fountaines, and the groves, In such a straine as Laura had admir'd Her Petrarch more, had he been so inspir'd. Some, Phœbus gives, a smooth and streaming veine, A great and happy fancy some attaine, Others unto a soaring height he lifts; But here he hath so crouded all his gifts, As if he had design'd in one to try, To what a pitch he could bring Poetry; For every grace should he receive a Crown, There were not Bays enough in Helicon: Fame courts his Verse, and with immortall wings Hovers about his Monument, and brings A deathlesse trophy to his memory; Who, for such honour, would not wish to dye? Never could any times afford a Story Of one so match'd unto great Sidney's glory; Or Fame so well divided, as between Penhurst's renowned shades, and Hawthornden. Edw: Phillips. To W. D. Some will not leave that Trust to Friend, nor Heire, But their own winding-Sheet themselves prepare; Fearing, perhaps some courser Cloath might shroud The wormes descended from their noble Bloud: And shalt not thou (that justlier maist suspect Far courser stuffe, in such a dull neglect Of all the Arts, and dearth of Poetry) Compose before hand thine own Elegy? Who but thyself is capable to write A Verse, or, if they can, to fashion it Unto thy Praises? None can draw a Line Of thy perfections, but a hand divine. If thou wilt needs impose this Task on us, (A greater Work than best Wits can discusse) We will but only so far Embleme Thee, As in a circle, men, the Deity. A wreath of Bayes we'll lay upon thy Herse; For that shall speake Thee better than our Verse: That art in number of those Things, whose end, Nor whose beginning we can comprehend. A Star, which did the other Day appeare, T'enlighten up our dark'ned Hemispheare: Nor can we tell nor how, nor whence it came, Yet feele the heat of thy admired flame. 'Twas thou that thaw'd our North, 'twas thou didst cleare The eternall mists which had beset us here, Till by thy golden Beames and powerfull Ray Thou chas'd hence darknesse, and brought out the Day. But as the Sun, though he bestow all Light On us, yet hinders by the same our sight To gaze on him; So thou, though thou dispence Far more on us by thy bright influence, Yet such is thy transcendent brightnesse, we Thereby are dazled, and cannot reach thee; Then art thou less'ned, should we bound thy Praise T'our narrow dull conceit, which cannot raise Themselves beyond a vulgar Theame, nor flye A pitch like unto thine in Poesie; Yet (as the greatest Kings have sometimes dain'd The smallest Presents from a poore man's hand; When pure devotion gave them) it may be Your Genius will accept a mite from me: It speaks my Love, although it reach not you; And you are praised, when I would so do. John Spotswood. To William Drummond of Hawthornden. I never rested on the Muses bed, Nor dipt my Quill in the Thessalian Fountaine, My rustick Muse was rudely fostered, And flies too low to reach the double mountaine. Then do not sparkes with your bright Suns compare, Perfection in a Womans work is rare; From an untroubled mind should Verses flow; My discontents make mine too muddy show; And hoarse encumbrances of houshold care; Where these remaine, the Muses ne're repaire. If thou dost extoll her Haire, Or her Ivory Forehead faire, Or those Stars whose bright reflection Thrals thy heart in sweet subjection: Or when to display thou seeks The snow-mixt Roses on her Cheekes, Or those Rubies soft and sweet, Over those pretty Rows that meet. The Chian Painter as asham'd Hides his Picture so far fam'd; And the Queen he carv'd it by, With a blush her face doth dye, Since those Lines do limne a Creature That so far surpast her Feature. When thou shew'st how fairest Flora Prankt with pride the banks of Ora, So thy Verse her streames doth honour, Strangers grow enamoured on her, All the Swans that swim in Po Would their native brooks forgo, And, as loathing Phœbus beames, Long to bath in cooler streames. Tree-turn'd Daphne would be seen In her Groves to flourish green, And her Boughs would gladly spare To frame a garland for thy haire, That fairest Nymphs with finest fingers May thee crown the best of singers. But when thy Muse dissolv'd in show'rs, Wailes that peerlesse Prince of ours, Cropt by too untimely Fate, Her mourning doth exasperate Senselesse things to see thee moane, Stones do weep, and Trees do groane, Birds in aire, Fishes in flood, Beasts in field forsake their food; The Nymphs forgoing all their Bow'rs Teare their Chaplets deckt with Flow'rs; Sol himselfe with misty vapor Hides from earth his glorious Tapor, And as mov'd to heare thee plaine Shews his griefe in show'rs of raine. Mary Oxlie of Morpet. Sir George Mackenzie, His Majesty's Advocate, being in Hawthornden's Closet, wrote down this Elogy of him. Here liv'd that Poet, whose Immortal Name Was Crown'd by Lawrels, and adorn'd by Fame; Whom every Man next to himself did love; Who durst be Loyal, and, what's more, reprove The Vices of that base rebellious Age; His was a Poet's, theirs a Tyrant's Rage. Each Man him then his Neighbour wish'd to be, And we now grieve that we did not him see. They did his Wit, we do his Works admire, And each young Spark does kindle at his Fire: Or, which is more, he Poems can beget On my old Muse, tho' now much past the Date. To the Memory of William Drummond of Hawthornden. He who endeavours Damon's Worth to raise, Does not the Bards, but his own Merit praise. Here Ours, and England's Wits, in vain have strove To write his Merit, and express their Love. For Poets now to Sound enslave their Sense, And Gild, where they shou'd Paint true Excellence; And who in duller Prose can hope to shew, What's to his Name or to his Labours due? I own no Art can Drummond's Worth proclaim; So vast his Merit, and so loud his Fame. David Crawford of Drumsoy. By the same Hand. [Here Damon liv'd, a Man by Heav'n inspir'd] Here Damon liv'd, a Man by Heav'n inspir'd, At Home ador'd, by Foreigners admired: Vast was his Muse, his Thoughts by Art refin'd; His Judgment, like his Fancy, unconfin'd; His Country's Honour, and his Friends Delight; Great Britain's Wonder, and the Age's Light. In ev'ry thing we find the Bard excel, And his Five Jameses, and his Poems tell, No Man e're thought, and spoke his Thoughts so well. Heav'n guard the Place, and may his Race maintain That Stock of Fame which he did justly gain. Upon Hawthornden's Muse. By the Same. Here Mighty Damon often sat, When he in heav'nly Numbers writ. The Place seems pointed out by Fate, And for a Muse, like his, made fit. His Cypress Grove, and easy Poems show, What Shades like these on Souls like his can do. This was his Muse. This rais'd the God-like Thought, Which Art and Judgment to Perfection brought. April 30th, 1702. POEMS: By W. D. THE FIRST PART. Sonnet. [i] [In my first Yeeres, and Prime yet not at Hight] In my first Yeeres, and Prime yet not at Hight, When sweet Conceits my Wits did entertaine, Ere Beauties Force I knew or false Delight, Or to what Oareshee did her Captiues chaine; Led by a sacred Troupe of Phœbus Traine, I first beganne to reade, then Loue to write, And so to praise a perfect Red and White, But (God wot) wist not what was in my Braine: Loue smylde to see in what an awfull Guise I turn'd those Antiques of the Age of Gold, And that I might moe Mysteries behold, Hee set so faire a Volumne to mine Eyes, That I [quires clos'd which (dead) dead Sighs but breath] Ioye on this liuing Booke to reade my Death. Son. [ii] [I know that all beneath the Moone decayes] I know that all beneath the Moone decayes, And what by Mortalles in this World is brought, In Times great Periods shall returne to nought, That fairest States haue fatall Nights and Dayes: I know how all the Muses heauenly Layes, With Toyle of Spright which are so dearely bought, As idle Sounds of few, or none are sought, And that nought lighter is than airie Praise. I know fraile Beautie like the purple Flowre, To which one Morne oft Birth and Death affords, That Loue a Iarring is of Mindes Accords, Where Sense and Will inuassall Reasons Power: Know what I list, this all can not mee moue, But that (ô mee!) I both must write, and loue. Son. [iii] [Yee who so curiously doe paint your Thoughts] Yee who so curiously doe paint your Thoughts, Enlightning eu'rie Line in such a Guise, That they seeme rather to haue fallen from Skies, Than of a humane Hand bee mortall Draughts; In one Part Sorrow so tormented lies, As if his Life at eu'ry Sigh would parte, Loue here blindfolded stands with Bow and Dart, There Hope lookes pale, Despaire with rainie Eyes: Of my rude Pincell looke not for such Arte, My Wit I finde now lessened to deuise So high Conceptions to expresse my Smart, And some thinke Loue but fain'd, if too too wise: These troubled Words and Lines confus'd you finde, Are like vnto their Modell my sicke Minde. Son. [iv] [Faire is my Yoke, though grieuous bee my Paines] Faire is my Yoke, though grieuous bee my Paines, Sweet are my Wounds, although they deeply smart, My Bit is Gold, though shortned bee the Raines, My Bondage braue, though I may not depart: Although I burne, the Fire which doth impart Those Flames, so sweet reuiuing Force containes, That (like Arabias Bird) my wasted Heart Made quicke by Death, more liuely still remaines. I joye, though oft my waking Eyes spend Teares, I neuer want Delight, euen when I grone, Best companied when most I am alone, A Heauen of Hopes I haue midst Hells of Feares: Thus euery Way Contentment strange I finde, But most in Her rare Beautie, my rare Minde. Son. [v] [How that vaste Heauen intitled First is rold] How that vaste Heauen intitled First is rold, If any other Worlds beyond it lie, And People liuing in Eternitie, Or Essence pure that doth this All vphold: What Motion haue those fixed Sparkes of Gold, The wandring Carbuncles which shine from hie, By Sprights, or Bodies, contrare-Wayes in Skie If they bee turn'd, and mortall Things behold: How Sunne postes Heauen about, how Nights pale Queene With borrowed Beames lookes on this hanging Round, What Cause faire Iris hath, and Monsters seene In Aires large Fields of Light, and Seas profound, Did hold my wandring Thoughts; when thy sweet Eye Bade mee leaue all, and only thinke on Thee. Son. [vi] [Vaunt not, faire Heauens, of your two glorious Lights] Vaunt not, faire Heauens, of your two glorious Lights, Which though most bright, yet see not when they shine, And shining, cannot shew their Beames diuine Both in one Place, but parte by Dayes and Nights, Earth, vaunt not of those Treasures yee enshrine, Held only deare because hidde from our Sights, Your pure and burnish'd Gold, your Diamonds fine, Snow-passing Iuorie that the Eye delights: Nor Seas of those deare Wares are in you found, Vaunt not, rich Pearle, red Corrall, which doe stirre A fond Desire in Fooles to plunge your Ground; Those all (more faire) are to bee had in Her: Pearle, Iuorie, Corrall, Diamond, Sunnes, Gold, Teeth, Necke, Lips, Heart, Eyes, Haire, are to behold. Son. [vii] [That learned Græcian (who did so excell] That learned Græcian (who did so excell In Knowledge passing Sense, that hee is nam'd Of all the after-Worlds Diuine) doth tell, That at the Time when first our Soules are fram'd, Ere in these Mansions blinde they come to dwell, They liue bright Rayes of that Eternall Light, And others see, know, loue, in Heauens great Hight, Not toylde with ought to Reason doth rebell; Most true it is, for straight at the first Sight My Minde mee told, that in some other Place It elsewhere saw the Idea of that Face, And lou'd a Loue of heauenly pure Delight. No Wonder now I feele so faire a Flame, Sith I Her lou'd ere on this Earth shee came. Son. [viii] [Now while the Night her sable Vaile hath spred] Now while the Night her sable Vaile hath spred, And silently her restie Coach doth rolle, Rowsing with Her from Tethis azure Bed Those starrie Nymphes which dance about the Pole. While Cynthia, in purest Cipres cled, The Latmian Shepheard in a Trance descries, And whiles lookes pale from hight of all the Skies, Whiles dyes her Beauties in a bashfull Red, While Sleepe (in Triumph) closed hath all Eyes, And Birds and Beastes a Silence sweet doe keepe, And Protevs monstrous People in the Deepe, The Winds and Waues (husht vp) to rest entise, I wake, muse, weepe, and who my Heart hath slaine See still before me to augment my Paine. Son. [ix] [Sleepe, Silence Child, sweet Father of soft Rest] Sleepe, Silence Child, sweet Father of soft Rest, Prince whose Approach Peace to all Mortalls brings, Indifferent Host to Shepheards and to Kings, Sole Comforter of Minds with Griefe opprest. Loe, by thy charming Rod all breathing things Lie slumbring, with forgetfulnesse possest, And yet o're me to spred thy drowsie Wings Thou spares (alas) who cannot be thy Guest. Since I am thine, O come, but with that Face To inward Light which thou art wont to show, With fained Solace ease a true felt Woe, Or if deafe God thou doe denie that Grace, Come as thou wilt, and what thou wilt bequeath, I long to kisse the Image of my Death. Son. [x] [Faire Moone who with thy Cold and Siluer Shine] Faire Moone who with thy Cold and Siluer Shine Makes sweet the Horrour of the dreadfull Night, Delighting the weake Eye with Smiles diuine, Which Phebvs dazells with his too much Light. Bright Queene of the first Heauen, if in thy Shrine By turning oft, and Heauens eternall Might, Thou hast not yet that once sweet Fire of thine Endemion, forgot, and Louers Plight? If Cause like thine may Pitie breede in thee, And Pitie somewhat els to it obtaine, Since thou hast Power of Dreames as well as Hee Who paints strange Figures in the slumbring Braine: Now while She sleepes in dolefull Guise her Show These Teares, and the blacke Mappe of all my Woe. Son. [xi] [Lampe of Heauens Christall Hall that brings the Hours] Lampe of Heauens Christall Hall that brings the Hours, Eye-dazaler who makes the vglie Night At thine Approach flie to her slumbrie Bowrs, And fills the World with Wonder and Delight: Life of all Lifes, Death-giuer by thy Flight To Southerne Pole from these sixe Signes of ours, Gold-smith of all the Starres, with Siluer bright Who Moone enamells, Apelles of the Flowrs. Ah, from those watrie Plaines thy golden Head Raise vp, and bring the so long lingring Morne, A Graue, nay Hell, I finde become this Bed, This Bed so grieuously where I am torne: But (woe is me) though thou now brought the Day, Day shall but serue more Sorrowe to display. Song. [i] [It was the time when to our Northerne Pole] It was the time when to our Northerne Pole The brightest Lampe of Heauen beginnes to rolle, When Earth more wanton in new Robes appeareth, And scorning Skies her Flowrs in Raine-bowes beareth, On which the Aire moist Saphires doth bequeath, Which quake to feele the kissing Zephires breath: When Birds from shadie Groues their Loue foorth warble, And Sea like Heauen, Heauen lookes like smoothest Marble, When I, in simple Course, free from all Cares, Farre from the muddie Worlds captiuing Snares, By Oras flowrie Bancks alone did wander, Ora that sports her like to old Meander, A Floud more worthie Fame and lasting Praise Than that which Phaetons Fall so high did raise: Into whose moouing Glasse the Milk-white Lillies Doe dresse their Tresses and the Daffadillies. Where Ora with a Wood is crown'd about And seemes forget the Way how to come out, A Place there is, where a delicious Fountaine Springs from the swelling Paps of a proud Mountaine, Whose falling Streames the quiet Caues doe wound, And make the Ecchoes shrill resound that Sound. The Lawrell there the shining Channell graces, The Palme her Loue with long-stretch'd Armes embraces, The Poplar spreds her Branches to the Skie, And hides from sight that azure Cannopie. The Streames the Trees, the Trees their leaues still nourish, That Place graue Winter finds not without Flourish. If liuing Eyes Elysian fields could see This little Arden might Elysium bee. Here Diane often vsed to repose Her, And Acidalias Queene with Mars reioyce her: The Nymphes oft here doe bring their Maunds with Flowres, And Anadeames weaue for their Paramours, The Satyres in those Shades are heard to languish, And make the Shepheards Partners of their Anguish, The Shepheards who in Barkes of tender Trees Doe graue their Loues, Disdaines, and Ielousies, Which Phillis when there by Her Flockes she feedeth With Pitie whyles, sometime with laughter reedeth. Neare to this place when Sunne in midst of Day, In highest top of Heauen his Coach did stay, And (as aduising) on his Carier glanced The way did rest, the space he had aduanced His panting Steeds along those Fields of light, Most princely looking from that gastly hight: When most the Grashoppers are heard in Meadowes, And loftie Pines haue small, or els no Shadowes, It was my hap, O wofull hap! to bide Where thickest Shades me from all Rayes did hide Into a shut-vp-place, some Syluans Chamber, Whose Seeling spred was with the Lockes of Amber Of new-bloom'd Sicamors, Floore wrought with Flowres, More sweete and rich than those in Princes Bowres. Here Adon blush't, and Clitia all amazed Lookt pale, with Him who in the Fountaine gazed, The Amaranthus smyl'd, and that sweet Boy Which sometime was the God of Delos joy: The braue Carnation, speckled Pinke here shined, The Violet her fainting Head declined Beneath a drowsie Chasbow, all of Gold The Marigold her leaues did here vnfold. Now while that rauish'd with delight and wonder, Halfe in a trance I lay those Arches vnder, The season, silence, place, did all entise Eyes heauie lids to bring Night on their Skies, Which softly hauing stollen themselues together (Like Euening Clouds) me plac'd I wote not whether. As Cowards leaue the Fort which they should keepe My senses one by one gaue place to Sleepe, Who followed with a Troupe of golden Slombers Thrust from my quiet Braine all base Encombers, And thrise me touching with his Rod of Gold, A Heauen of Visions in my Temples roll'd, To countervaile those Pleasures were bereft me, Thus in his silent Prison clos'd he left me. Me thought through all the Neighbour Woods a noyce Of Quiristers, more sweet than Lute or voyce, (For those harmonious sounds to IOVE are giuen By the swift touches of the nyne-string'd Heauen, Such are, and nothing else) did wound mine Eare, No Soule, that then became all Eare to heare: And whilst I listning lay O gastly wonder! I saw a pleasant Mirtle cleaue asunder, A Mirtle great with birth, from whose rent wombe Three naked Nymphes more white than snow foorth come. For Nymphes they seem'd, about their heauenly Faces In Waues of Gold did flow their curling Tresses, About each Arme, their Armes more white than milke, Each weare a blushing Armelet of silke, The Goddesses such were that by Scamander, Appeared to the Phrygian Alexander, Aglaia, and her Sisters such perchance Be, when about some sacred Spring they dance. But scarce the Groue their naked Beauties graced, And on the amorous Verdure had not traced, When to the Floud they ran, the Floud in Robes Of curling Christall to brests Yuorie Globes Who wrapt them all about, yet seem'd take pleasure To showe warme Snowes throughout her liquid Azure. Looke howe Prometheus Man when heauenly Fire First gaue him Breath Dayes Brandon did admire, And wondred of this Worlds Amphitheater, So gaz'd I on those new guests of the Water. All three were faire, yet one excell'd as farre The rest, as Phebus doth the Cyprian Starre, Or Diamonds small Gemmes, or Gemmes doe other, Or Pearles that shining shell is call'd their Mother. Her haire more bright than are the Mornings Beames Hang in a golden shower aboue the Streames, And (sweetly tous'd) her forehead sought to couer, Which seene did straight a Skie of Milke discouer, With two faire Browes, Loues Bowes, which neuer bend But that a Golden Arrow foorth they send. Beneath the which two burning Planets glancing Flasht Flames of Loue, for Loue there still is dancing. Her either Cheeke resembl'd a blushing Morne, Or Roses Gueules in field of Lillies borne: Betwixt the which a Wall so faire is raised, That it is but abased euen when praised. Her Lips like Rowes of Corrall soft did swell, And th' one like th' other only doth excell: The Tyrian Fish lookes pale, pale looke the Roses, The Rubies pale, when Mouths sweet Cherrie closes. Her Chinne like siluer Phebe did appeare Darke in the midst to make the rest more cleare: Her Necke seem'd fram'd by curious Phidias Master, Most smooth, most white, a piece of Alabaster. Two foaming Billowes flow'd vpon her Brest, Which did their tops with Corrall red encrest: There all about as Brookes them sport at leasure, With Circling Branches veines did swell in Azure: Within those Crookes are only found those Isles Which Fortunate the dreaming old World Stiles. The rest the Streames did hide, but as a Lillie Suncke in a Christalls faire transparent Bellie. I, who yet humane weaknesse did not know (For yet I had not felt that Archers Bow, Ne could I thinke that from the coldest Water The winged Youngling burning Flames could scatter) On euery part my vagabounding Sight Did cast, and drowne mine Eyes in sweet Delight. What wondrous Thing is this that Beautie's named (Said I) I finde I heretofore haue dreamed? And neuer knowne in all my flying Dayes Good vnto this, that only merites Praise. My Pleasures haue beene Paines, my Comforts Crosses, My Treasure Pouertie, my Gaines but Losses. O precious Sight! which none doth els descrie Except the burning Sunne, and quiuering I. And yet O deare bought Sight! O would for euer I might enioy you, or had ioy'd you never! O happie Floud! if so yee might abide, Yet euer glorie of this Moments Pride, Adjure your Rillets all now to beholde Her, And in their Christall Armes to come and fold Her: And sith yee may not ay your Blisse embrace, Draw thousand Pourtraits of Her on your Face, Pourtraits which in my Heart be more apparent, If like to yours my Brest but were transparent. O that I were while she doth in you play, A Daulphine to transport Her to the Sea, To none of all those Gods I would Her rander From Thule to Inde though I should with Her wander. Oh! what is this? the more I fixe mine Eye, Mine Eye the more new Wonders doth espie, The more I spie, the more in vncouth fashion My Soule is rauish'd in a pleasant Passion. But looke not Eyes, as more I would haue said A Sound of whirling Wheeles me all dismayde, And with the Sound foorth from the timorous Bushes With storme-like Course a sumptuous Chariot rushes, A Chariot all of Gold, the Wheeles were Gold, The Nailes, and Axetree Gold on which it roll'd: The vpmost Part a Scarlet Vaile did couer, More rich than Danaes Lap spred with her Louer: In midst of it in a triumphing Chaire, A Ladie sate miraculously faire, Whose pensiue Countenance, and Lookes of Honor, Doe more allure the Mind that thinketh on Her, Than the most wanton Face and amorous Eyes, That Amathus or flowrie Paphos sees. A Crue of Virgins made a Ring about Her, The Diamond shee, they seeme the Gold without Her. Such Thetis is when to the Billowes rore With Mermaids nyce shee danceth on the Shore: So in a sable Night the Sunnes bright Sister Among the lesser twinckling Lights doth glister. Faire Yoakes of Ermelines, whose Colour passe The whitest Snowes on aged Grampius Face, More swift than Venus Birds this Chariot guided To the astonish'd Bancke where as it bided. But long it did not bide, when poore those Streames Aye me! it made, transporting those rich Gemmes, And by that Burthen lighter, swiftly driued Till (as me thought) it at a Towre arriued. Vpon a Rocke of Christall shining cleare Of Diamonds this Castle did appeare, Whose rising Spires of Gold so high them reared That Atlas-like it seem'd the Heauen they beared. Amidst which Hights on Arches did arise (Arches which guilt Flames brandish to the Skies) Of sparking Topaces, Prowde, Gorgeous, Ample, (Like to a litle Heauen) a sacred Temple: Whose Walls no Windowes haue, nay all the Wall Is but one Window, Night there doth not fall More when the Sunne to Westerne Worlds declineth, Than in our Zenith when at Noone He shineth. Two flaming Hills the Passage strait defend Which to this radiant Building doth ascend, Vpon whose Arching tops on a Pilastre A Port stands open, rais'd in Loues Disastre, For none that narrow Bridge and Gate can passe, Who haue their Faces seene in Venus Glasse. If those within, but to come foorth doe venter, That stately Place againe they neuer enter. The Precinct strengthened with a Ditch appeares, In which doth swell a Lake of Inkie Teares Of madding Louers, who abide there moning, And thicken euen the Aire with piteous Groning. This Hold (to braue the Skies) the Destines fram'd, The World the Fort of Chastitie it nam'd. The Queene of the third Heauen once to appall it, The God of Thrace here brought who could not thrall it, For which he vow'd ne're Armes more to put on, And on Riphean Hills was heard to grone. Here Psyches Louer hurles his Darts at randon, Which all for nought him serue as doth his Brandon. What bitter Anguish did inuade my Minde, When in that Place my Hope I saw confinde, Where with high-towring Thoughts I onely reacht Her, Which did burne vp their Wings when they approacht Her? Mee thought I set me by a Cypresse Shade, And Night and Day the Hyacinthe there reade: And that bewailing Nightingalles did borrow Plaints of my Plaint, and Sorrowes of my Sorrow. My Food was Wormewood, mine owne Teares my Drinke, My Rest on Death, and sad Mishaps to thinke. And for such Thoughts to haue my Heart enlarged, And ease mine Eyes with brinie Tribute charged, Ouer a Brooke (me thought) my pining Face I laid, which then (as grieu'd at my Disgrace) A Face Me shew'd againe so ouer-clouded, That at the Sight mine Eyes afray'd them shrowded. This is the guerdon Loue, this is the Gaine In end which to thy Seruants doth remaine, I would haue said, when Feare made Sleepe to leaue me, And of those fatall Shadowes did bereaue me. But ah alas! in stead to dreame of Loue, And Woes, mee made them in effect to proue, For what into my troubled Braine was painted, I waking found that Time, and Place presented. Son. [xii] [Ah burning Thoughts now let me take some Rest] Ah burning Thoughts now let me take some Rest, And your tumultuous Broyles a while appease, Is't not enough, Starres, Fortune, Loue molest Me all at once, but yee must to displease? Let Hope (though false) yet lodge within my Brest, My high Attempt (though dangerous) yet praise, What though I trace not right Heauens steppie Wayes? It doth suffice, my Fall shall make me blest. I doe not doate on Dayes, nor feare not Death, So that my Life be braue, what though not long? Let me Renown'd liue from the vulgare Throng, And when yee list (Heauens) take this borrowed Breath. Men but like Visions are, Time all doth claime, He liues, who dies to winne a lasting Name. Madrigall. [i] [A dedale of my Death] A dedale of my Death, Now I resemble that subtile Worme on Earth Which prone to its owne euill can take no rest. For with strange Thoughts possest, I feede on fading Leaues Of Hope, which me deceaues, And thousand Webs doth warpe within my Brest. And thus in end vnto my selfe I weaue A fast-shut Prison, no, but euen a Graue. Sextain. [i] [The Heauen doth not containe so many Starres] The Heauen doth not containe so many Starres, So many Leaues not prostrate lie in Woods, When Autumne's old, and Boreas sounds his Warres, So many Waues haue not the Ocean Floods, As my rent Mind hath Torments all the Night, And Heart spends Sighes, when Phebvs brings the Light. Why should I beene a Partner of the Light? Who crost in Birth by bad Aspects of Starres, Haue neuer since had happie Day nor Night, Why was not I a Liuer in the Woods, Or Citizen of Thetis Christall Floods, Than made a Man, for Loue and Fortunes Warres? I looke each Day when Death should ende the Warres, Vnciuill Warres, twixt Sense and Reasons Light, My Paines I count to Mountaines, Meads, and Floods, And of my Sorrow Partners makes the Starres, All desolate I haunt the fearfull Woods When I should giue my selfe to Rest at Night. With watchfull Eyes I ne're beholde the Night, Mother of Peace, but ah to me of Warres, And Cynthia Queene-like shining through the Woods, When straight those Lamps come in my Thought, whose Light My Iudgement dazel'd, passing brightest Starres, And then mine Eyes en-isle themselues with Floods. Turne to their Springs againe first shall the Floods, Cleare shall the Sunne the sad and gloomie Night, To dance about the Pole cease shall the Starres, The Elements renew their ancient Warres Shall first, and bee depriu'd of Place and Light, Ere I finde Rest in Citie, Fields, or Woods. Ende these my Dayes Endwellers of the Woods, Take this my Life yee deepe and raging Floods, Sunne neuer rise to cleare mee with thy Light, Horror and Darknesse keepe a lasting Night, Consume me Care with thy intestine Warres, And stay your Influence o're me bright Starres. In vaine the Starres, Endwellers of the Woods, Care, Horror, Warres I call and raging Floods, For all haue sworne no Night shall dimme my Sight. Son. [xiii] [O sacred Blush impurpling Cheekes pure Skies] O sacred Blush impurpling Cheekes pure Skies, With crimson Wings which spred thee like the Morne, O bashfull Looke sent from those shining Eyes, Which (though cast down on Earth) couldst Heauen adorne! O Tongue in which most lushious Nectar lies, That can at once both blesse and make forlorne, Deare Corrall Lip which Beautie beautifies, That trembling stood ere that her words were borne. And you her Words, Words no, but Golden Chaines Which did captiue mine Eares, ensnare my Soule, Wise Image of her Minde, Minde that containes A Power all Power of Senses to controule: Yee all from Loue disswade so sweetly mee, That I loue more, if more my Loue could bee. Son. [xiv] [Nor Arne, nor Mincius, nor stately Tyber] Nor Arne, nor Mincius, nor stately Tyber, Sebethus, nor the Floud into whose Streames He fell who burnt the World with borrow'd Beames, Gold-rolling Tagus, Munda, famous Iber; Sorgue, Rosne, Loire, Garron, nor prowd-banked Seine, Peneus, Phasis, Xanthus, humble Ladon, Nor Shee whose Nymphes excell her who lou'd Adon Faire Tamesis, nor Ister large, nor Rheine, Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Hermus, Gange, Pearlie Hydaspes, Serpent-like Meander, The Golfe bereft sweet Hero her Leander, Nile that farre farre his hidden Head doth range, Haue euer had so rare a Cause of Praise, As Ora, where this Northerne Phenix stayes. Son. [xv] [To heare my Plaints faire Riuer Christalline] To heare my Plaints faire Riuer Christalline Thou in a silent Slumber seemes to stay, Delicious Flowrs, Lillie and Columbine, Yee bowe your Heades when I my Woes display. Forrests, in you the Mirtle, Palme, and Bay, Haue had compassion listning to my Grones, The Winds with Sighes haue solemniz'd my Mones Mong Leaues, which whisper'd what they could not say. The Caues, the Rockes, the Hills the Syluans Thrones (As if euen Pitie did in them appeare) Haue at my Sorrowes rent their ruethlesse Stones, Each thing I finde hath sense except my Deare Who doth not thinke I loue, or will not know My Griefe, perchance delighting in my Woe. Son. [xvi] [Sweet Brooke, in whose cleare Christall I mine Eyes] Sweet Brooke, in whose cleare Christall I mine Eyes Haue oft seene great in Labour of their Teares, Enamell'd Banke, whose shining Grauell beares These sad Characters of my Miseries. High Woods, whose mounting Tops menace the Spheares, Wild Citizens, Amphions of the Trees, You gloomie Groues at hottest Noones which freeze, Elysian Shades which Phebus neuer cleares, Vaste solitarie Mountaines, pleasant Plaines, Embrodred Meads that Ocean-wayes you reach, Hills, Dales, Springs, all that my sad Cry constraines To take part of my Plaints, and learne Woes Speach, Will that remorselesse Faire e're Pitie show, Of Grace now answere if yee ought know? No. Son. [xvii] [With flaming Hornes the Bull now brings the Yeare] With flaming Hornes the Bull now brings the Yeare, Melt doe the horride Mountaines Helmes of Snow, The siluer Flouds in pearlie Channells flow, The late-bare Woods greene Anadeams doe weare. The Nightingall forgetting Winters Woe, Calls vp the lazie Morne her Notes to heare, Those Flowrs are spred which Names of Princes beare, Some red, some azure, white, and golden grow. Here lowes a Heifer, there bea-wailing strayes. A harmelesse Lambe, not farre a Stag rebounds, The Sheepe-heards sing to grazing Flockes sweet Layes, And all about the Ecchoing Aire resounds. Hills, Dales, Woods, Flouds, &amp; euery thing doth change, But Shee in Rigour, I in Loue am strange. Son. [xviii] [When Nature now had wonderfully wrought] When Nature now had wonderfully wrought All Avristellas Parts, except her Eyes, To make those Twinnes two Lamps in Beauties Skies, Shee Counsell of her starrie Senate sought. Mars and Apollo first did Her aduise In Colour Blacke to wrappe those Comets bright, That Loue him so might soberly disguise, And vnperceiued Wound at euery Sight. Chaste Phebe spake for purest azure Dyes, But Iove and Venvs greene about the Light To frame thought best, as bringing most Delight, That to pin'd Hearts Hope might for ay arise: Nature (all said) a Paradise of Greene There plac'd, to make all loue which haue them seene. Mad. [ii] [To the delightfull Greene] To the delightfull Greene Of you faire radiant Eine, Let each Blacke yeeld beneath the starrie Arche. Eyes, burnisht Heauens of Loue, Sinople Lampes of Ioue, Saue that those Hearts which with your Flames yee parche Two burning Sunnes you proue, All other Eyes compar'd with you (deare Lights) Bee Hells, or if not Hells yet dumpish Nights. The Heauens (if we their Glasse The Sea beleeue) bee greene, not perfect blew. They all make faire what euer faire yet was, And they bee faire because they looke like you. Son. [xix] [In vaine I haunt the colde and siluer Springs] In vaine I haunt the colde and siluer Springs, To quench the Feuer burning in my Vaines, In vaine (Loues Pilgrime) Mountaines, Dales, and Plaines, I ouer-runne, vaine Helpe long Absence brings. In vaine (my Friends) your Counsell me constraines To flie, and place my Thoughts on other Things, Ah! like the Bird that fired hath her Wings, The more I moue, the greater are my Paines. Desire (alas) Desire a Zeuxis new, From Indies borrowing Gold, from Westerne Skies Most bright Cynoper, sets before mine Eyes In euery Place, her Haire, sweet Looke and Hew: That flie, runne, rest I, all doth proue but vaine, My Life lies in those Lookes which haue me slaine. Son. [xx] [All other Beauties how so e're they shine] All other Beauties how so e're they shine In Haires more bright than is the golden Ore, Or Cheekes more faire than fairest Eglantine, Or Hands like Hers who comes the Sunne before: Match'd with that Heauenly Hue, and Shape diuine, With those deare Starres which my weake Thoughts adore, Looke but like Shaddowes, or if they bee more, It is in that that they are like to thine. Who sees those Eyes, their Force and doth not proue, Who gazeth on the Dimple of that Chinne, And findes not Venus Sonne entrench'd therein, Or hath not Sense, or knowes not what is Loue. To see thee had Narcissus had the Grace, Hee sure had died with wondring on thy Face. Son. [xxi] [My Teares may well Numidian Lions tame] My Teares may well Numidian Lions tame, And Pitie breede into the hardest Hart That euer Pirrha did to Maide impart, When Shee them first of blushing Rockes did frame. Ah Eyes which only serue to waile my Smart, How long will you mine inward Woes proclaime? Let it suffice you beare a weeping Part All Night, at Day though yee doe not the same: Cease idle Sighes to spend your Stormes in vaine, And these calme secret Shades more to molest, Containe you in the Prison of my Brest, You not doe ease but aggrauate my Paine, Or (if burst foorth you must?) that Tempest moue In Sight of Her whome I so dearely loue. Son. [xxii] [Nymphes, Sister Nymphes which haunt this christall Brooke] Nymphes, Sister Nymphes which haunt this christall Brooke, And (happie) in these Floting Bowrs abide, Where trembling Roofes of Trees from Sunne you hide, Which make Ideall Woods in euery Crooke, Whether yee Garlands for your Lockes prouide, Or pearlie Letters seeke in sandie Booke, Or count your Loues when Thetis was a Bride? Lift vp your golden Heads and on mee looke. Read in mine Eyes mine agonizing Cares, And what yee read recount to Her againe: Faire Nymphes, say all these Streames are but my Teares, And if Shee aske you how they sweet remaine, Tell that the bittrest Teares which Eyes can powre, When shed for Her doe cease more to be sowre. Mad. [iii] [Like the Idalian Queene] Like the Idalian Queene Her Haire about her Eyne, With Necke and Brests ripe Apples to be seene, At first Glance of the Morne In Cyprus Gardens gathering those faire Flowrs Which of her Bloud were borne, I saw, but fainting saw, my Paramours. The Graces naked danc'd about the Place, The Winds and Trees amaz'd With Silence on Her gaz'd, The Flowrs did smile, like those vpon her Face, And as their Aspine Stalkes those Fingers band, (That Shee might read my Case) A Hyacinth I wisht mee in her Hand. Son. [xxiii] [Then is Shee gone? O Foole and Coward I!] Then is Shee gone? O Foole and Coward I! O good Occasion lost, ne're to bee found! What fatall Chaines haue my dull Senses bound When best they may that they not Fortune trie? Here is the flowrie Bed where Shee did lie, With Roses here Shee stellified the Ground, Shee fix'd her Eyes on this (yet smyling) Pond, Nor Time, nor courteous Place seem'd ought denie. Too long, too long (Respect) I doe embrace Your Counsell, full of Threats and sharpe Disdaine; Disdaine in her sweet Heart can haue no Place, And though come there, must straight retire againe: Hencefoorth Respect farewell, I oft heare tolde Who liues in Loue can neuer bee too bolde. Son. [xxiv] [In Minds pure Glasse when I my selfe behold] In Minds pure Glasse when I my selfe behold, And viuely see how my best Dayes are spent, What Clouds of Care aboue my Head are roll'd, What comming Harmes, which I can not preuent: My begunne Course I (wearied) doe repent, And would embrace what Reason oft hath told, But scarce thus thinke I, when Loue hath controld All the best Reasons Reason could inuent. Though sure I know my Labours End is Griefe, The more I striue that I the more shall pine, That only Death can be my last Reliefe: Yet when I thinke vpon that Face diuine, Like one with Arrow shot in Laughters Place, Malgre my Heart I ioye in my Disgrace. Son. [xxv] [Deare Quirister, who from those Shaddowes sends] Deare Quirister, who from those Shaddowes sends (Ere that the blushing Dawne dare show her Light) Such sad lamenting Straines, that Night attends Become all Eare, Starres stay to heare thy Plight. If one whose Griefe euen Reach of Thought transcends, Who ne're (not in a Dreame) did taste Delight, May thee importune who like Case pretends, And seemes to ioy in Woe, in Woes Despight? Tell me (so may thou Fortune milder trie, And long long sing) for what thou thus complaines? Sith (Winter gone) the Sunne in dapled Skie Now smiles on Meadowes, Mountaines, Woods and Plaines: The Bird, as if my questions did her moue, With trembling Wings sobb'd foorth I loue, I loue. Son. [xxvi] [Trust not sweet Soule those curled Waues of Gold] Trust not sweet Soule those curled Waues of Gold With gentle Tides which on your Temples flow, Nor Temples spread with Flackes of Virgine Snow, Nor Snow of Cheekes with Tyrian Graine enroll'd. Trust not those shining Lights which wrought my Woe, When first I did their burning Rayes beholde, Nor Voyce, whose Sounds more strange Effects doe show Than of the Thracian Harper haue beene tolde: Looke to this dying Lillie, fading Rose, Darke Hyacinthe, of late whose blushing Beames Made all the neighbouring Herbes and Grasse reioyce, And thinke how litle is twixt Lifes Extreames: The cruell Tyrant that did kill those Flowrs, Shall once (aye mee) not spare that Spring of yours. Son. [xxvii] [That I so slenderly set foorth my Minde] That I so slenderly set foorth my Minde, Writing I wote not what in ragged Rimes, And charg'd with Brasse into these golden Times When others towre so high am left behinde: I craue not Phebvs leaue his sacred Cell To binde my Browes with fresh Aonian Bayes, Let them haue that who tuning sweetest Layes By Tempe sit, or Aganippe Well, Nor yet to Venus Tree doe I aspire, Sith Shee for whome I might affect that Praise, My best Attempts with cruell Words gainsayes, And I seeke not that Others me admire. Of weeping Myrrhe the Crowne is which I craue, With a sad Cypresse to adorne my Graue. Son. [xxviii] [Sound hoarse sad Lute, true Witnesse of my Woe] Sound hoarse sad Lute, true Witnesse of my Woe, And striue no more to ease selfe-chosen Paine With Soule-enchanting Sounds, your Accents straine Vnto these Teares vncessantly which flow. Shrill Treeble weepe, and you dull Basses show Your Masters Sorrow in a deadly Vaine, Let neuer ioyfull Hand vpon you goe, Nor Consort keepe but when you doe complaine. Flie Phœbus Rayes, nay, hate the irkesome Light, Woods solitarie Shades for thee are best, Or the blacke Horrours of the blackest Night, When all the World (saue Thou and I) doth rest: Then sound sad Lute, and beare a mourning Part, Thou Hell may'st mooue, though not a Womans Heart. Son. [xxix] [You restlesse Seas, appease your roaring Waues] You restlesse Seas, appease your roaring Waues, And you who raise hudge Mountaines in that Plaine Aires Trumpeters, your blustring Stormes restraine, And listen to the Plaints my Griefe doth cause. Eternall Lights, though adamantine Lawes Of Destinies to mooue still you ordaine, Turne hitherward your Eyes, your Axetree pause, And wonder at the Torments I sustaine. Earth (if thou bee not dull'd by my Disgrace, And senselesse made?) now aske those Powers aboue Why they so crost a Wretch brought on thy Face? Fram'd for Mis-hap, th' Anachorite of Loue, And bid them if they would moe Ætnas burne, In Rhodopee or Erimanthe mee turne. Son. [xxx] [What cruell Starre into this World mee brought?] What cruell Starre into this World mee brought? What gloomie Day did dawne to giue mee Light? What vnkinde Hand to nourse mee (Orphane) sought, And would not leaue mee in eternall Night? What thing so deare as I hath Essence bought? The Elements, drie, humid, heauie, light, The smallest liuing things by Nature wrought, Bee freed of Woe if they haue small Delight. Ah only I, abandon'd to Despaire, Nail'd to my Torments, in pale Horrours Shade, Like wandring Clouds see all my Comforts fled, And Euill on Euill with Hours my Life impaire: The Heauen and Fortune which were wont to turne, Fixt in one Mansion staye to cause mee mourne. Son. [xxxi] [Deare Eye which daign'st on this sad Monument] Deare Eye which daign'st on this sad Monument The sable Scroule of my Mis-haps to view, Though with the mourning Muses Teares besprent, And darkly drawne, which is not fain'd, but true, If thou not dazell'd with a Heauenly Hue, And comely Feature, didst not yet lament? But happie liu'st vnto thy selfe content, O let not Loue thee to his Lawes subdue. Looke on the wofull Shipwracke of my Youth, And let my Ruines for a Phare thee serue To shunne this Rocke Capharean of Vntrueth, And serue no God who doth his Church-men sterue: His Kingdome is but Plaints, his Guerdon Teares, What hee giues more are Iealousies and Feares. Son. [xxxii] [If crost with all Mis-haps bee my poore Life] If crost with all Mis-haps bee my poore Life, If one short Day I neuer spent in Mirth, If my Spright with it selfe holds lasting Strife, If Sorrowes Death is but new Sorrowes Birth? If this vaine World bee but a sable Stage Where slaue-borne Man playes to the scoffing Starres, If Youth bee toss'd with Loue, with Weaknesse Age, If Knowledge serue to holde our Thoughts in Warres? If Time can close the hundreth Mouths of Fame, And make what long since past, like that to bee, If Vertue only bee an idle Name, If I when I was borne was borne to die? Why seeke I to prolong these loathsome Dayes, The fairest Rose in shortest time decayes? Son. [xxxiii] [Let Fortune triumph now, and Iö sing] Let Fortune triumph now, and Iö sing, Sith I must fall beneath this Load of Care, Let Her what most I prize of eu'rie Thing Now wicked Trophees in her Temple reare. Shee who high Palmie Empires doth not spare, And tramples in the Dust the prowdest King, Let Her vaunt how my Blisse Shee did impaire, To what low Ebbe Shee now my Flow doth bring. Let Her count how (a new Ixion) Mee Shee in her Wheele did turne, how high nor low I neuer stood, but more to tortur'd bee: Weepe Soule, weepe plaintfull Soule, thy Sorrowes know, Weepe, of thy Teares till a blacke Riuer swell, Which may Cocytus be to this thy Hell. Son. [xxxiv] [O cruell Beautie, Meekenesse inhumaine] O cruell Beautie, Meekenesse inhumaine, That Night and day contend with my Desire, And seeke my Hope to kill, not quench my Fire, By Death, not Baulme to ease my pleasant Paine. Though yee my Thoughts tread downe which would aspire, And bound my Blisse, doe not (alas) disdaine That I your matchlesse Worth and Grace admire, And for their Cause these Torments sharpe sustaine. Let great Empedocles vaunt of his Death Found in the midst of those Sicylian Flames, And Phaëton that Heauen him reft of Breath, And Dædals Sonne He nam'd the Samian Streames: Their Haps I enuie not, my Praise shall bee, The fairest Shee that liu'd gaue Death to mee. Son. [xxxv] [The Hyperborean Hills, Ceraunus Snow] The Hyperborean Hills, Ceraunus Snow, Or Arimaspus (cruell) first thee bred, The Caspian Tigers with their Milke thee fed, And Faunes did humane Bloud on thee bestow. Fierce Orithyas Louer in thy Bed Thee lull'd asleepe, where he enrag'd doth blow, Thou didst not drinke the Flouds which here doe flow, But Teares, or those by ycie Tanais Hed. Sith thou disdaines my Loue, neglects my Griefe, Laughs at my Grones, and still affects my Death, Of thee, nor Heauen I'll seeke no more Reliefe, Nor longer entertaine this loathsome Breath, But yeeld vnto my Starre, that thou mayst proue, What Losse thou hadst in losing such a Loue. Song. [ii] [Phoebus arise] Phoebus arise, And paint the sable Skies With azure, white, and Red: Rowse Memnons Mother from her Tythons Bed, That Shee thy Cariere may with Roses spred, The Nightingalles thy Comming each where sing, Make an eternall Spring, Giue Life to this darke World which lieth dead. Spreade foorth thy golden Haire In larger Lockes than thou wast wont before, And Emperour-like decore With Diademe of Pearle thy Temples faire: Chase hence the vglie Night Which serues but to make deare thy glorious Light. This is that happie Morne, That Day long wished Day, Of all my Life so darke, (If cruell Starres haue not my Ruine sworne, And Fates not Hope betray?) Which (only white) deserues A Diamond for euer should it marke: This is the Morne should bring vnto this Groue My Loue, to heare, and recompense my loue. Faire King who all preserues, But show thy blushing Beames, And thou two sweeter Eyes Shalt see than those which by Peneus Streames Did once thy Heart surprise: Nay, Sunnes, which shine as cleare As thou when two thou did to Rome appeare. Now Flora decke thy selfe in fairest Guise, If that yee, Winds, would heare A Voyce surpassing farre Amphions Lyre, Your stormie chiding stay, Let Zephyre only breath, And with her Tresses play, Kissing sometimes these purple Ports of Death. The Windes all silent are, And Phœbus in his Chaire Ensaffroning Sea and Aire, Makes vanish euery Starre: Night like a Drunkard reeles Beyond the Hills to shunne his flaming Wheeles. The Fields with Flowrs are deckt in euery Hue, The Clouds bespangle with bright Gold their Blew: Here is the pleasant Place And eu'ry thing, saue Her, who all should grace. Son. [xxxvi] [Who hath not seene into her saffron Bed] Who hath not seene into her saffron Bed The Mornings Goddesse mildly Her repose, Or Her of whose pure Bloud first sprang the Rose, Lull'd in a Slumber by a Mirtle Shade. Who hath not seene that sleeping White and Red Makes Phœbe looke so pale, which Shee did close In that Iönian Hill, to ease her Woes, Which only liues by Nectare Kisses fed: Come but and see my Ladie sweetly sleepe, The sighing Rubies of those heauenly Lips, The Cupids which Brests golden Apples keepe, Those Eyes which shine in midst of their Ecclipse, And Hee them all shall see (perhaps) and proue Shee waking but perswades, now forceth Loue. Son. [xxxvii] [Of Cithereas Birds that milke-white paire] Of Cithereas Birds that milke-white paire On yonder leauie Mirtle Tree which grone, And waken with their kisses in the Aire Enamour'd Zephyres murmuring one by one, If thou but Sense hadst like Pigmalions Stone? Or hadst not seene Medusas snakie haire, Loues Lessons thou mightst learne? and learne sweete Faire, To Summers Heat ere that thy Spring bee growne. And if those kissing Louers seeme but Cold, Looke how that Elme this Iuie doth embrace, And bindes, and claspes with many a wanton Fold, And courting Sleepe o'reshadowes all the Place: Nay seemes to say, deare Tree we shall not parte, In Signe whereof loe in each Leafe a Heart. Son. [xxxviii] [The Sunne is faire when hee with crimson Crowne] The Sunne is faire when hee with crimson Crowne, And flaming Rubies leaues his Easterne Bed, Faire is Thaumantias in her christall Gowne When Clouds engemm'd hang azure, greene, and Red. To Westerne Worlds when wearied Day goes downe, And from Heauens Windowes each Starre showes her Hed, Earths silent Daughter Night is faire, though browne, Faire is the Moone though in Loues Liuerie cled. Faire Chloris is when Shee doth paint Aprile, Faire are the Meads, the Woods, the Flouds are faire, Faire looketh Ceres with her yellow Haire, And Apples Queene when Rose-cheekt Shee doth smile. That Heauen, and Earth, and Seas are faire is true, Yet true that all not please so much as you. Mad. [iv] [When as shee smiles I finde] When as shee smiles I finde More light before mine Eyes, Nor when the Sunne from Inde Brings to our World a flowrie Paradise: But when shee gently weepes, And powres foorth pearlie Showres, On Cheekes faire blushing Flowres, A sweet Melancholie my Senses keepes. Both feede so my Disease, So much both doe me please, That oft I doubt, which more my Heart doth burne, Like Loue to see her smile, or Pitie mourne. Son. [xxxix] [Slide soft faire Forth, and make a christall Plaine] Slide soft faire Forth, and make a christall Plaine, Cut your white Lockes, and on your foamie Face Let not a Wrinckle bee, when you embrace The Boat that Earths Perfections doth containe. Windes wonder, and through wondring holde your Peace, Or if that yee your Hearts cannot restraine From sending Sighes, mou'd by a Louers Case, Sigh, and in her faire Haire your selues enchaine: Or take these Sighes which Absence makes arise From mine oppressed Brest and waue the Sailes, Or some sweet Breath new brought from Paradise: Flouds seeme to smile, Loue o're the Winds preueails, And yet hudge Waues arise, the Cause is this, The Ocean striues with Forth the Boate to kisse. Son. [xl] [Ah! who can see those Fruites of Paradise] Ah! who can see those Fruites of Paradise, Celestiall Cherries which so sweetly swell That Sweetnesse selfe confinde there seemes to dwell, And all those sweetest Parts about despise? Ah! who can see and feele no Flame surprise His hardened Heart? for mee (alas) too well I know their Force, and how they doe excell, Now burne I through Desire, now doe I freeze: I die (deare Life) vnlesse to mee bee giuen As many Kisses as the Spring hath Flowrs, Or as the siluer Drops of Iris Showrs, Or as the Starres in all-embracing Heauen, And if displeas'd yee of the Match complaine, Yee shall haue leaue to take them backe againe. Son. [xli] [Is't not enough (aye mee) mee thus to see] Is't not enough (aye mee) mee thus to see Like some Heauen-banish'd Ghost still wailing goe? A Shadow which your Rayes doe only show, To vexe mee more, vnlesse yee bid mee die? What could yee worse allotte vnto your Foe? But die will I, so yee will not denie That Grace to mee which mortall Foes euen trie, To chuse what sort of Death should ende my Woe. One Time I found when as yee did mee kisse, Yee gaue my panting Soule so sweet a Touch, That halfe I sown'd in midst of all my Blisse, I doe but craue my Deaths Wound may bee such: For though by Griefe I die not and Annoy, Is't not enough to die through too much Ioy? Mad. [v] [Sweete Rose whence is this Hue] Sweete Rose whence is this Hue Which doth all Hues excell? Whence this most fragrant Smell? And whence this Forme and gracing Grace in you? In flowrie Paestums Field (perhaps) yee grew, Or Hyblas Hills you bred, Or odoriferous Ennas Plaines you fed, Or Tmolus, or where Bore yong Adon slew, Or hath the Queene of Loue you dy'd of new In that deare Bloud, which makes you looke so red? No, none of those, but Cause more high you blist, My Ladies Brest you bare, and Lips you kist. Son. [xlii] [Shee whose faire flowrs no Autumne makes decay] Shee whose faire flowrs no Autumne makes decay, Whose Hue celestiall, earthly Hues doth staine, Into a pleasant odoriferous Plaine Did walke alone, to braue the Pride of Maye: And whilst through chekred Lists shee made her Way, Which smil'd about her Sight to entertaine, Loe (vnawares) where Loue did hid remaine Shee spide, and sought to make of him her Prey: For which of golden Lockes a fairest Haire (To binde the Boy) shee tooke, But hee afraid At her Approach sprang swiftly in the Aire, And mounting farre from Reach look'd backe and said, Why shouldst thou (Sweet) me seeke in Chaines to binde, Sith in thine Eyes I dayly am confinde. Mad. [vi] [On this colde World of Ours] On this colde World of Ours, Flowre of the Seasons, Season of the Flowrs, Sonne of the Sunne sweet Spring, Such hote and burning Dayes why doest thou bring? Is this for that those high Eternall Pow'rs Flash downe that Fire this All enuironing? Or that now Phœbus keepes his Sisters Spheare? Or doth some Phaëton Enflame the Sea and Aire? Or rather is it (Vsher of the Yeare) For that last Day amongst thy Flowrs alone Vnmask'd thou saw'st my Faire? And whilst thou on her gaz'd shee did thee burne, And in thy Brother Summer doth thee turne. Son. [xliii] [Deare Wood, and you sweet solitarie Place] Deare Wood, and you sweet solitarie Place, Where from the vulgare I estranged liue, Contented more with what your Shades mee giue, Than if I had what Thetis doth embrace: What snakie Eye growne iealous of my Peace, Now from your silent Horrours would mee driue? When Sunne progressing in his glorious Race Beyond the Twinnes, doth neare our Pole arriue. What sweet Delight a quiet Life affords, And what it is to bee of Bondage free, Farre from the madding Worldlings hoarse Discords, Sweet flowrie Place I first did learne of thee: Ah! if I were mine owne, your deare Resorts I would not change with Princes stately Courts. Sextain. [ii] [Sith gone is my Delight and only Pleasure] Sith gone is my Delight and only Pleasure, The last of all my Hopes, the chearfull Sunne That clear'd my Lifes darke Day, Natures sweet Treasure, More deare to mee than all beneath the Moone, What resteth now, but that vpon this Mountaine I weepe, till Heauen transforme mee in a Fountaine? Fresh, faire, delicious, christall, pearlie Fountaine, On whose smoothe Face to looke shee oft tooke Pleasure, Tell mee (so may thy Streames long cheare this Mountaine, So Serpent ne're thee staine, nor scorch the Sunne, So may with gentle Beames thee kisse the Moone) Doest thou not mourne to want so faire a Treasure? While shee her glass'd in thee, rich Tagvs Treasure Thou enuie needed not, nor yet the Fountaine In which that Hunter saw the naked Moone, Absence hath robb'd thee of thy Wealth and Pleasure, And I remaine like Marigold of Sunne Depriu'd, that dies by Shadow of some Mountaine. Nymphes of the Forrests, Nymphes who on this Mountaine Are wont to dance, shewing your Beauties Treasure To Goate-feete Syluans, and the wondring Sunne, When as you gather Flowres about this Fountaine, Bid Her Farewell who placed here her Pleasure, And sing her Praises to the Starres and Moone. Among the lesser Lights as is the Moone, Blushing through Scarfe of Clouds on Latmos Mountaine, Or when her siluer Lockes shee lookes for Pleasure In Thetis Streames, prowde of so gay a Treasure, Such was my Faire when Shee sate by this Fountaine With other Nymphes, to shunne the amorous Sunne. As is our Earth in Absence of the Sunne, Or when of Sunne depriued is the Moone, As is without a verdant Shade a Fountaine, Or wanting Grasse, a Mead, a Vale, a Mountaine, Such is my State, bereft of my deare Treasure, To know whose only Worth was all my Pleasure. Ne're thinke of Pleasure Heart, Eyes shunne the Sunne, Teares be your Treasure, which the wandring Moone Shall see you shed by Mountaine, Vale, and Fountaine. Son. [xliv] [Thou Window, once which serued for a Spheare] Thou Window, once which serued for a Spheare To that deare Planet of my Heart, whose Light Made often blush the glorious Queene of Night, While Shee in thee more beautious did appeare, What mourning Weedes (alas) now do'st thou weare? How loathsome to mine Eyes is thy sad Sight? How poorely look'st thou, with what heauie cheare, Since that Sunne set, which made thee shine so bright? Vnhappie now thee close, for as of late To wondring Eyes thou wast a Paradise, Bereft of Her who made thee fortunate, A Gulfe thou art, whence Cloudes of Sighes arise: But vnto none so noysome as to mee, Who hourly see my murth'red Ioyes in thee. Son. [xlv] [Are these the flowrie Bankes? is this the Mead] Are these the flowrie Bankes? is this the Mead Where Shee was wont to passe the pleasant hours? Did here her Eyes exhale mine Eyes salt Showrs, When on her Lap I laide my wearie Head? Is this the goodly Elme did vs o'respread, Whose tender Rine cut out in curious Flowrs By that white Hand, containes those Flames of Ours? Is this the rusling Spring vs Musicke made? Deflourish'd Mead where is your heauenly Hue? Banke, where that Arras did you late adorne, How looke yee Elme all withered and forlorne? Onely sweet Spring nought altered seemes in you: But while here chang'd each other thing appeares, To sowre your Streames take of mine Eyes these Teares. Son. [xlvi] [Alexis, here shee stay'd among these Pines] Alexis, here shee stay'd among these Pines (Sweet Hermitresse) shee did alone repaire, Here did shee spreade the Treasure of her Haire, More rich than that brought from the Colchian Mines. Shee set Her by these musket Eglantines, The happie Place the Print seemes yet to beare, Her Voyce did sweeten here thy sugred Lines, To which Winds, Trees, Beasts, Birds did lend their Eare. Mee here shee first perceiu'd, and here a Morne Of bright Carnations did o'respreade her Face, Here did shee sigh, here first my Hopes were borne, And I first got a Pledge of promis'd Grace: But (ah) what seru'd it to bee happie so? Sith passed Pleasures double but new Woe. Son. [xlvii] [O Night, cleare Night, O darke and gloomie Day!] O Night, cleare Night, O darke and gloomie Day! O wofull Waking! O Soule-pleasing Sleepe! O sweet Conceits which in my Braines did creepe! Yet sowre Conceits which went so soone away. A Sleepe I had more than poore Words can say, For clos'd in Armes (mee thought) I did thee keepe, A sorie Wretch plung'd in Mis-fortunes deepe Am I not wak'd? when Light doth Lies bewray. O that that Night had euer still bene blacke! O that that Day had neuer yet begunne! And you mine Eyes would yee no time saw Sunne! To haue your Sunne in such a Zodiacke: Loe, what is good of Life is but a Dreame, When Sorrow is a neuer-ebbing Streame. Son. [xlviii] [Haire, precious Haire which Midas Hand did straine] Haire, precious Haire which Midas Hand did straine, Part of the Wreathe of Gold that crownes those Browes Which Winters whitest White in Whitenesse staine, And Lillie, by Eridans Banke that growes. Haire (fatall Present) which first caus'd my Woes, When loose yee hang like Danaës golden Raine, Sweet Nettes, which sweetly doe all Hearts enchaine, Strings, deadly Strings, with which Loue bends his Bowes. How are yee hither come? tell me, O Haire, Deare Armelet, for what thus were yee giuen? I know a Badge of Bondage I you weare, Yet Haire for you, ô that I were a Heauen! Like Berenices Locke that yee might shine (But brighter farre) about this Arme of mine. Mad. [vii] [Vnhappie Light] Vnhappie Light, Doe not approach to bring the wofull Day, When I must bid for ay Farewell to Her, and liue in endlesse Plight. Faire Moone, with gentle Beames The Sight who neuer marres, Long cleare Heauens sable Vault, and you bright Starres Your golden Lockes long glasse in Earths pure Streames, Let Phœbus neuer rise To dimme your watchfull Eyes: Prolong (alas) prolong my short Delight, And if yee can, make an eternall Night. Son. [xlix] [With Griefe in Heart, and Teares in sowning Eyes] With Griefe in Heart, and Teares in sowning Eyes, When I to Her had giu'n a sad Fare-well, Close sealed with a Kisse, and Dew which fell On my else-moystned Face from Beauties Skies. So strange Amazement did my Minde surprise, That at each Pace I fainting turn'd againe, Like One whome a Torpedo stupifies, Not feeling Honours Bit, nor Reasons Raine. But when fierce Starres to parte mee did constraine, With backe-cast Lookes I enui'd both and bless'd The happie Walles and Place did Her containe, Till that Sights Shafts their flying Obiect miss'd, So wailing parted Ganamede the faire, When Eagles Talents bare him through the Aire. Mad. [viii] [I feare not hencefoorth Death] I feare not hencefoorth Death, Sith after this Departure yet I breath, Let Rocks, and Seas, and Wind, Their highest Treasons show, Let Skie and Earth combinde Striue (if they can) to ende my Life and Woe: Sith Griefe can not, mee nothing can o'rethrow, Or if that ought can cause my fatall Lot, It will bee when I heare I am forgot. Son. [l] [How many times Nights silent Queene her Face] How many times Nights silent Queene her Face Hath hid, how oft with Starres in siluer Maske In Heauens great Hall shee hath begunne her Taske, And chear'd the waking Eye in lower Place: How oft the Sunne hath made by Heauens swift Race The happie Louer to forsake the Brest Of his deare Ladie, wishing in the West His golden Coach to runne had larger Space: I euer count, and number, since alas I bade Farewell to my Hearts dearest Guest, The Miles I compasse, and in Minde I chase The Flouds and Mountaines holde mee from my Rest: But (woe is mee) long count and count may I, Ere I see Her whose Absence makes mee die. Son. [li] [So grieuous is my Paine, so painefull Life] So grieuous is my Paine, so painefull Life, That oft I finde mee in the Armes of Death, But (Breath halfe gone) that Tyrant called Death Who others killes, restoreth mee to Life: For while I thinke how Woe shall ende with Life, And that I quiet Peace shall ioye by Death, That Thought euen doth o'repowre the Paines of Death, And call mee home againe to lothed Life: Thus doth mine euill transcend both Life and Death, While no Death is so bad as is my Life, Nor no Life such which doth not ende by Death, And Protean Changes turne my Death and Life: O happie those who in their Birth finde Death, Sith but to languish Heauen affordeth Life. Son. [lii] [Fame, who with golden Pennes abroad dost range] Fame, who with golden Pennes abroad dost range Where Phœbus leaues the Night, and brings the Day, Fame, in one Place who (restlesse) dost not stay Till thou hast flowne from Atlas vnto Gange: Fame, Enemie to Time that still doth change, And in his changing Course would make decay What here below he findeth in his Way, Euen making Vertue to her selfe looke strange. Daughter of Heauen; Now all thy Trumpets sound, Raise vp thy Head vnto the highest Skie, With Wonder blaze the Gifts in Her are found, And when shee from this mortall Globe shall flie, In thy wide Mouth, keepe long long keepe her Name, So thou by Her, shee by thee liue shall Fame. Mad. [ix] [The Iuorie, Corrall, Gold] The Iuorie, Corrall, Gold, Of Brest, of Lips, of Haire, So liuely Sleepe doth show to inward Sight, That wake I thinke I hold No Shadow, but my Faire: My selfe so to deceaue With long-shut Eyes I shunne the irkesome Light. Such Pleasure thus I haue Delighting in false Gleames, If Death Sleepes Brother bee? And Soules relieu'd of Sense haue so sweete Dreames? That I would wish mee thus to dreame and die. Son. [liii] [I curse the Night, yet doth from Day mee hide] I curse the Night, yet doth from Day mee hide, The Pandionian Birds I tyre with Mones, The Ecchoes euen are weari'd with my Grones, Since Absence did mee from my Blisse diuide. Each Dreame, each Toy, my Reason doth affright, And when Remembrance reades the curious Scroule Of pass'd Contentments caused by her Sight, Then bitter Anguish doth inuade my Soule. While thus I liue ecclipsed of her Light (O mee!) what better am I than the Mole? Or those whose Zenith is the only Pole, Whose Hemispheare is hid with so long Night? Saue that in Earth he rests, they hope for Sunne, I pine, and finde mine endlesse Night begunne. Son. [liv] [Of Death some tell, some of the cruell Paine] Of Death some tell, some of the cruell Paine Which that bad Crafts-man in his Worke did trie, When (a new Monster) Flames once did constraine A humane Corps to yeeld a brutish Crie. Some tell of those in burning Beds who lie, For that they durst in the Phlegræan Plaine The mightie Rulers of the Skie defie, And siege those christall Towres which all containe. An other countes of Phlegethons hote Floods The Soules which drinke, Ixions endlesse Smart, And his to whom a Vulture eates the Heart, One telles of Specters in enchanted Woods: Of all those Paines he who the worst would proue, Let him bee absent, and but pine in Loue. Mad. [x] [Tritons, which bounding diue] Tritons, which bounding diue Through Neptunes liquide Plaine, When as yee shall arriue With tilting Tides where siluer Ora playes, And to your King his watrie Tribute payes, Tell how I dying liue, And burne in midst of all the coldest Maine. Son. [lv] [Place mee where angry Titan burnes the More] Place mee where angry Titan burnes the More, And thirstie Africke firie Monsters brings, Or where the new-borne Phœnix spreades her Wings, And Troupes of wondring Birds her Flight adore. Place mee by Gange, or Indes empampred Shore, Where smyling Heauens on Earth cause double Springs, Place mee where Neptunes Quire of Syrens sings, Or where (made hoarse through Cold) hee leaues to roare. Mee place where Fortune doth her Darlings crowne, A Wonder, or a Sparke in Enuies Eye, Or late outragious Fates vpon mee frowne, And Pittie wailing see disastred Mee, Affections Print my Minde so deepe doth proue, I may forget my Selfe, but not my Loue. THE SECOND PART. Sonnet. [i] [Of mortall Glorie ô soone darkned Raye!] Of mortall Glorie ô soone darkned Raye! O posting Ioyes of Man! more swift than Winde, O fond Desires! which wing'd with Fancies straye, O traitrous Hopes! which doe our Iudgements blinde: Loe, in a Flash that Light is gone away, Which dazell did each Eye, Delight each Minde, And with that Sunne (from whence it came) combinde, Now makes more radiant Heauens eternall Day. Let Beautie now be blubbred Cheekes with Teares, Let widow'd Musicke only roare, and plaine, Poore Vertue get thee Wings, and mount the Spheares, And let thine only Name on Earth remaine. Death hath thy Temple raz'd, Loues Empire foylde, The World of Honour, Worth, and Sweetnesse spoylde. Son. [ii] [Those Eyes, those sparkling Saphires of Delight] Those Eyes, those sparkling Saphires of Delight, Which thousand thousand Hearts did set on fire, Which made that Eye of Heauen that brings the Light (Oft jealous) staye amaz'd them to admire. That liuing Snow, those crimson Roses bright, Those Pearles, those Rubies, which did breede Desire, Those Lockes of Gold, that Purple faire of Tyre, Are wrapt (aye mee!) vp in eternall Night. What hast thou more to vaunt of, wretched World? Sith shee (who cursed thee made blest) is gone? Thine euer-burning Lamps, Rounds euer whorld, Can vnto thee not modell such a one: For if they would such Beautie bring on Earth, They should be forc'd againe to make Her breath. Son. [iii] [O Fate! conspir'd to powre your Worst on mee] O Fate! conspir'd to powre your Worst on mee, O rigorous Rigour, which doth all confound! With cruell Hands yee haue cut downe the Tree, And Fruit and Flowre dispersed on the Ground. A litle Space of Earth my Loue doth bound, That Beautie which did raise it to the Skie, Turn'd in neglected Dust, now low doth lie, Deafe to my Plaints, and senslesse of my Wound. Ah! did I liue for this, ah! did I loue? For this and was it shee did so excell? That ere shee well Lifes sweet-sowre Ioyes did proue, Shee should (too deare a Guest) with Horrour dwell? Weake Influence of Heauen! what faire yee frame, Falles in the Prime, and passeth like a Dreame. Son. [iv] [O woefull Life! Life, no, but liuing Death] O woefull Life! Life, no, but liuing Death, Fraile Boat of Christall in a rockie Sea, A Sport expos'd to Fortunes stormie Breath, Which kept with Paine, with Terrour doth decay: The false Delights, true Woes thou dost bequeath, Mine all-appalled Minde doe so affraye, That I those enuie who are laid in Earth, And pittie them that runne thy dreadfull Waye. When did mine Eyes behold one chearefull Morne? When had my tossed Soule one Night of rest? When did not hatefull Starres my Projects scorne? O! now I finde for Mortalls what is best: Euen, sith our voyage shamefull is, and short, Soone to strike Saile, and perish in the Port. Son. [v] [Mine Eyes, dissolue your Globes in brinie Streames] Mine Eyes, dissolue your Globes in brinie Streames, And with a Cloud of Sorrow dimme your Sight, The Sunnes bright Sunne is set, of late whose Beames Gaue Luster to your Day, Day to your Night. My Voyce now deafen Earth with Anatheames, Roare foorth a Challenge in the Worlds Despight, Tell that disguised Griefe is her Delight, That Life a Slumber is of fearfull Dreames. And woefull Minde abhorre to thinke of Ioy, My Senses all now comfortlesse you hide, Accept no Object but of blacke Annoy, Teares, Plaints, Sighs, mourning Weeds, Graues gaping wide, I haue nought left to wish, my Hopes are dead, And all with Her beneath a Marble laide. Son. [vi] [Sweet Soule, which in the Aprill of thy Yeares] Sweet Soule, which in the Aprill of thy Yeares So to enrich the Heauen mad'st poore this Round, And now with golden Rayes of Glorie crown'd Most blest abid'st aboue the Spheare of Spheares; If heauenly Lawes (alas) haue not thee bound From looking to this Globe that all vpbeares? If Rueth and Pittie there aboue bee found? O daigne to lend a Looke vnto those Teares. Doe not disdaine (deare Ghost) this sacrifice, And though I raise not Pillars to thy Praise Mine Offerings take, let this for mee suffice, My Heart a liuing Piramide I raise: And whilst Kings Tombes with Lawrels flourish greene, Thine shall with Mirtles, and these Flowrs bee seene. Madrigall. [i] [This Life which seemes so faire] This Life which seemes so faire, Is like a Bubble blowen vp in the Aire, By sporting Childrens Breath, Who chase it euery where, And striue who can most Motion it bequeath: And though it sometime seeme of its owne Might (Like to an Eye of gold) to be fix'd there, And firme to houer in that emptie Hight, That only is because it is so light, But in that Pompe it doth not long appeare; For euen when most admir'd, it in a Thought As swell'd from nothing, doth dissolue in nought. Son. [vii] [O! It is not to mee bright Lampe of Day] O! It is not to mee bright Lampe of Day, That in the East thou shew'st thy rosie Face, O! it is not to mee thou leau'st that Sea, And in these azure Lists beginst thy Race. Thou shin'st not to the Dead in any Place, And I (dead) from this World am gone away, Or if I seeme (a Shadow) yet to stay, It is a while but to bemone my Case. My Mirth is lost, my Comforts are dismay'd, And vnto sad Mis-haps their Place doe yeeld; My Knowledge doth resemble a bloudie field, Where I my Hopes, and Helps see prostrate layd. So painefull is Lifes Course which I haue runne, That I doe wish it neuer had begunne. Song. [i] [Sad Damon beeing come] Sad Damon beeing come To that for-euer lamentable Tombe, Which those eternall Powers that all controule Vnto his liuing Soule A melancholie Prison had prescriu'd: Of Hue, of Heate, of Motion quite depriu'd In Armes wake, trembling, cold, A Marble, hee the Marble did infold: And hauing made it warme with many a Showre, Which dimmed Eyes did powre, When Griefe had giuen him leaue, and Sighes them stay'd, Thus with a sad alas at last he said. Who would haue thought to mee The Place where thou didst lie could grieuous bee? And that (deare Body) long thee hauing sought (O mee!) who would have thought? Thee once to finde it should my Soule confound, And giue my Heart than Death a deeper Wound? Thou didst disdaine my Teares, But grieue not that this ruethfull Stone them beares, Mine Eyes serue only now for thee to weepe, And let their Course them keepe, Although thou neuer wouldst them Comfort show, Doe not repine, they haue Part of thy Woe. Ah Wretch! too late I finde, How Vertues glorious Titles proue but Winde; For if shee any could release from Death, Thou yet enioy'd hadst Breath; For if shee ere appear'd to mortall Eine, It was in thy faire Shape that shee was seene. But ô! if I was made For thee, with thee why too am I not dead? Why doe outragious Fates which dimm'd thy Sight, Let mee see hatefull Light? They without mee made Death thee to surprise Tyrants (perhaps) that they might kill mee twise. O Griefe! and could one Day Haue Force such Excellence to take away? Could a swift-flying Moment (ah) deface Those matchlesse Gifts, that Grace Which Art and Nature had in thee combinde, To make thy Body paragone thy Minde? Haue all past like a Cloud, And doth eternall Silence now them shroud? Is what so much admir'd was nought but Dust, Of which a Stone hath trust? O Change! ô cruell Change! thou to our Sight Shewes Destines Rigour equall doth their Might. When thou from Earth didst passe (Sweet Nymph) Perfections Mirrour broken was, And this of late so glorious World of ours, Like Meadow without Flowrs, Or Ring of a rich Gemme made blind, appear'd, Or Night, by Starre nor Cynthia neither clear'd. Loue when hee saw thee die, Entomb'd him in the Lidde of either Eye, And left his Torch within thy sacred Vrne, There for a Lampe to burne: Worth, Honour, Pleasure, with thy Life expir'd, Death since (growne sweet) beginnes to bee desir'd. Whilst thou to vs wast giuen, The Earth her Venus had as well as Heauen: Nay and her Sunne, which burnt as many Hearts, As hee doth Easterne Parts; Bright Sunne, which forc'd to leaue these Hemispheares, Benighted set into a Sea of Teares. Ah Death! who shall thee flie? Sith the most worthie bee o'rethrowne by thee? Thou spar'st the Rauens, and Nightingalles dost kill, And triumphes at thy will: But giue thou canst not such an other Blow, Because like Her Earth can none other show. O bitter-Sweets of Loue! How better is 't at all you not to proue? Than when wee doe your Pleasure most possesse, To find them then made lesse? O! that the Cause which doth consume our Ioy Remembrance of it too, would too destroy! What doth this Life bestow But Flowrs on Thornes which grow? Which though they sometime blandishing delighte, Yet afterwards vs smite? And if the rising Sunne them faire doth see, That Planet setting, too beholdes them die. This World is made a Hell, Depriu'd of all that in it did excell. O Pan, Pan, Wintèr is fallen in our May, Turn'd is in Night our Day; Forsake thy Pipe, a Scepter take to thee, Thy Lockes disgarland, thou blacke Ioue shalt bee. The Flockes doe leaue the Meads, And loathing three-leaf'd Grasse, hold vp their Heads. The Streames not glide now with a gentle Rore, Nor Birds sing as before, Hilles stand with Clouds like Mourners, vail'd in Blacke, And Owles on Caban Roofes fore-tell our Wracke. That Zephyre euerie Yeere So soone was heard to sigh in Forrests heere, It was for Her: that wrapt in Gownes of Greene, Meads were so earelie seene, That in the saddest Months oft sung the Mearles, It was for Her: for her Trees dropt foorth Pearles. That prowde, and statelie Courts, Did enuie those our Shades, and calme Resorts, It was for Her: and she is gone, ô Woe! Woods cut, againe doe grow, Budde doth the Rose, and Dazie, Winter done, But wee once dead no more doe see the Sunne. Whose Name shall now make ring The Ecchoes? of whom shall the Nymphettes sing? Whose heauenlie Voyce, whose Soule-inuading Straines, Shall fill with Ioy the Plaines? What Haire, what Eyes, can make the Morne in East Weepe, that a fairer riseth in the West? Faire Sunne, poste still away, No Musicke heere is found thy Course to stay. Sweet Hybla Swarmes with Wormewood fill your Bowrs, Gone is the Flowre of Flowrs, Blush no more Rose, nor Lillie pale remaine, Dead is that Beautie which yours late did staine. Aye mee! to waile my Plight Why haue not I as many Eyes as Night? Or as that Shepheard which Ioues Loue did keepe? That I still still may weepe: But though I had, my Teares vnto my Crosse Were not yet equall, nor Griefe to my Losse, Yet of you brinic Showrs, Which I heere powre, may spring as many Flowrs, As came of those which fell from Helens Eyes, And when yee doe arise, May euerie Leafe in sable Letters beare The dolefull Cause for which yee spring vp heere. Mad. [ii] [Deare Night, the Ease of Care] Deare Night, the Ease of Care, Vntroubled Seate of Peace, Times eldest Childe, which oft the Blinde doe see, On this our Hemispheare, What makes thee now so sadly darke to bee? Comm'st thou in funerall Pompe her Graue to grace? Or doe those Starres which should thy Horrour cleare, In Ioues high Hall aduise, In what Part of the Skies, With them, or Cynthia shee shall appeare? Or (ah alas!) because those matchlesse Eyes Which shone so faire, below thou dost not finde, Striu'st thou to make all other Eyes looke blinde? Son. [viii] [My Lute, bee as thou wast when thou didst grow] My Lute, bee as thou wast when thou didst grow With thy greene Mother in some shadie Groue, When immelodious Windes but made thee moue, And Birds on thee their Ramage did bestow. Sith that deare Voyce which did thy Sounds approue, Which vs'd in such harmonious Straines to flow, Is reft from Earth to tune those Spheares aboue, What art thou but a Harbenger of Woe? Thy pleasing Notes, be pleasing Notes no more, But orphane Wailings to the fainting Eare, Each Stoppe a Sigh, each Sound drawes foorth a Teare, Bee therefore silent as in Woods before, Or if that any Hand to touch thee daigne, Like widow'd Turtle, still her Losse complaine. Son. [ix] [Sweet Spring, thou turn'st with all thy goodlie Traine] Sweet Spring, thou turn'st with all thy goodlie Traine, Thy Head with Flames, thy Mantle bright with Flowrs, The Zephyres curle the greene Lockes of the Plaine, The Cloudes for Ioy in Pearles weepe downe their Showrs. Thou turn'st (sweet Youth) but ah my pleasant Howres, And happie Dayes, with thee come not againe, The sad Memorialls only of my Paine Doe with thee turne, which turne my Sweets in Sowres. Thou art the same which still thou wast before, Delicious, wanton, amiable, faire, But shee, whose Breath embaulm'd thy wholesome Aire, Is gone: nor Gold, nor Gemmes Her can restore. Neglected Vertue, Seasons goe and come, While thine forgot lie closed in a Tombe. Son. [x] [What doth it serue to see Sunnes burning Face?] What doth it serue to see Sunnes burning Face? And Skies enamell'd with both the Indies Gold? Or Moone at Night in jettie Charriot roll'd? And all the Glorie of that starrie Place? What doth it serue Earths Beautie to behold? The Mountaines Pride, the Meadowes flowrie Grace, The statelie Comelinesse of Forrests old, The Sport of Flouds which would themselues embrace? What doth it serue to heare the Syluans Songs, The wanton Mearle, the Nightingalles sad Straines, Which in darke Shades seeme to deplore my Wrongs? For what doth serue all that this World containes, Sith shee for whome those once to mee were deare, No Part of them can haue now with mee heere? Mad. [iii] [The Beautie, and the Life] The Beautie, and the Life, Of Lifes, and Beauties fairest Paragon, (O Teares! ô Griefe!) hang at a feeble Thread, To which pale Atropos had set her Knife, The Soule with many a Grone Had left each outward Part, And now did take his last Leaue of the Heart, Nought else did want, saue Death, euen to be dead: When the afflicted Band about her Bed (Seeing so faire him come in Lips, Cheekes, Eyes) Cried, ah! and can Death enter Paradise? Son. [xi] [Ah Napkin, ominous Present of my Deare] Ah Napkin, ominous Present of my Deare, Gift miserable, which doth now remaine The only Guerdon of my helpelesse Paine, When I thee got thou shew'd my State too cleare: I neuer since haue ceased to complaine, Since, I the Badge of Griefe did euer weare, Ioy on my Face durst neuer since appeare, Care was the Food which did mee entertaine. Now (since made mine) deare Napkin doe not grieue That I this Tribute pay thee from mine Eine, And that (these posting Houres I am to liue) I laundre thy faire Figures in this Brine: No, I must yet euen begge of thee the Grace, That thou wouldst daigne in Graue to shrowde my Face. Mad. [iv] [Poore Turtle, thou bemones] Poore Turtle, thou bemones The Losse of thy deare Loue, And I for mine send foorth these smoaking Grones, Vnhappie widow'd Doue, While all about doe sing, I at the Roote, Thou on the Branche aboue, Euen wearie with our Mones the gaudie Spring. Yet these our Plaints wee doe not spend in vaine, Sith sighing Zephyres answere vs againe. Son. [xii] [As in a duskie and tempestuous Night] As in a duskie and tempestuous Night, A Starre is wont to spreade her Lockes of Gold, And while her pleasant Rayes abroad are roll'd, Some spitefull Cloude doth robbe vs of her Sight: (Faire Soule) in this blacke Age so shin'd thou bright, And made all Eyes with Wonder thee beholde, Till vglie Death depriuing vs of Light, In his grimme mistie Armes thee did enfolde. Who more shall vaunt true Beautie heere to see? What Hope doth more in any Heart remaine, That such Perfections shall his Reason raine? If Beautie with thee borne too died with thee? World, plaine no more of Loue, nor count his Harmes, With his pale Trophees Death hath hung his Armes. Son. [xiii] [Sith it hath pleas'd that First and onlie Faire] Sith it hath pleas'd that First and onlie Faire To take that Beautie to himselfe againe, Which in this World of Sense not to remaine, But to amaze, was sent, and home repaire, The Loue which to that Beautie I did beare (Made pure of mortall Spots which did it staine, And endlesse, which euen Death cannot impaire) I place on him who will it not disdaine. No shining Eyes, no Lockes of curling Gold, No blushing Roses on a virgine Face, No outward Show, no, nor no inward Grace, Shall Force hereafter haue my Thoughts to hold: Loue heere on Earth hudge Stormes of Care doe tosse, But plac'd aboue, exempted is from Losse. Mad. [v] [My Thoughts hold mortall Strife] My Thoughts hold mortall Strife, I doe detest my Life, And with lamenting Cries (Peace to my Soule to bring) Oft calles that Prince which here doth Monarchise, But Hee grimme-grinning King, Who Catiues scornes, and doth the Blest surprise, Late hauing deckt with Beauties Rose his Tombe, Disdaines to croppe a Weede, and will not come. Song. [ii] [It Autumne was, and on our Hemispheare] It Autumne was, and on our Hemispheare Faire Ericyne began bright to appeare, Night West-ward did her gemmie World decline, And hide her Lights, that greater Light might shine: The crested Bird had giuen Alarum twise To lazie Mortalls, to vnlocke their Eyes, The Owle had left to plaine, and from each Thorne The wing'd Musicians did salute the Morne, Who (while shee glass'd her Lockes in Ganges Streames) Set open wide the christall Port of Dreames: When I, whose Eyes no drowsie Night could close, In Sleepes soft Armes did quietly repose, And, for that Heauens to die mee did denie, Deaths Image kissed, and as dead did lie. I lay as dead, but scarce charm'd were my Cares, And slaked scarce my Sighes, scarce dried my Teares, Sleepe scarce the vglie Figures of the Day Had with his sable Pincell put away, And left mee in a still and calmie Mood, When by my Bed (me thought) a Virgine stood, A Virgine in the blooming of her Prime, If such rare Beautie measur'd bee by Time? Her Head a Garland ware of Opalls bright, About Her flow'd a Gowne as pure as Light, Deare amber Lockes gaue Vmbrage to her Face, Where Modestie high Majestie did grace, Her Eyes such Beames sent foorth, that but with Paine Here, weaker Sights their sparckling could sustaine: No Deitie faign'd which haunts the silent Woods Is like to Her, nor Syrene of the Floods: Such is the golden Planet of the Yeare, When blushing in the East hee doth appeare. Her Grace did Beautie, Voyce yet Grace did passe, Which thus through Pearles and Rubies broken was. How long wilt thou (said shee) estrang'd from Ioy, Paint Shadowes to thy selfe of false Annoy? How long thy Minde with horride Shapes affrighte, And in imaginarie Euills delighte? Esteeme that Losse which (well when view'd) is Gaine, Or if a Losse, yet not a Losse to plaine? O leaue thy tyred Soule more to molest, And thinke that Woe when shortest then is best. If shee for whom thou deafnest thus the Skie Bee dead? what then? was shee not borne to die? Was shee not mortall borne? if thou dost grieue That Times should bee, in which shee should not liue, Ere e're shee was, weepe that Dayes Wheele was roll'd, Weepe that shee liu'd not in the Age of Gold: For that shee was not then, thou may'st deplore As duely as that now shee is no more. If onely shee had died, thou sure hadst Cause To blame the Destines and Heauens yrone Lawes: But looke how many Millions Her aduance, What numbers with Her enter in this Dance, With those which are to come: shall Heauens them staye, And Alls faire Order breake, thee to obaye? Euen as thy Birth, Death which thee doth appall, A Piece is of the Life of this great All. Strong Cities die, die doe high palmie Raignes, And (weakling) thou thus to bee handled plaines. If shee bee dead? then shee of lothsome Dayes Hath past the Line, whose Length but Losse bewrayes; Then shee hath left this filthie Stage of Care, Where Pleasure seldome, Woe doth still repaire: For all the Pleasures which it doth containe, Not conteruaile the smallest Minutes Paine. And tell mee, Thou who dost so much admire This litle Vapour, Smoake, this Sparke, or Fire, Which Life is call'd, what doth it thee bequeath, But some few Yeeres which Birth drawes out to Death? Which if thou paragone, with Lusters runne, And them whose Carriere is but now begunne, In Dayes great Vaste they shall farre lesse appeare, Than with the Sea when matched is a Teare. But why wouldst thou Here longer wish to bee? One Yeere doth serue all Natures Pompe to see, Nay, euen one Day, and Night: This Moone, that Sunne, Those lesser Fires about this Round which runne, Bee but the same which vnder Saturnes Raigne Did the serpenting Seasons enterchaine. How oft doth Life grow lesse by liuing long? And what excelleth but what dieth yong? For Age which all abhorre (yet would embrace) Whiles makes the Minde as wrinckled as the Face: And when that Destinies conspire with Worth, That Yeeres not glorie Wrong, Life soone goes forth. Leaue then Laments, and thinke thou didst not liue, Lawes to that first eternall Cause to giue, But to obey those Lawes which hee hath giuen, And bow vnto the just Decrees of Heauen, Which can not erre, what euer foggie Mists Doe blinde Men in these sublunarie Lists. But what if shee for whom thou spend'st those Grones, And wastest Lifes deare Torch in ruethfull Mones, Shee for whose sake thou hat'st the joyfull Light, Court'st solitarie Shades, and irkesome Night, Doth liue? ô! (if thou canst) through Teares a Space Lift thy dimm'd Lights, and looke vpon this Face, Looke if those Eyes which (foole) thou didst adore, Shine not more bright than they were wont before? Looke if those Roses Death could ought impaire, Those Roses to thee once which seem'd so faire? And if these Lockes haue lost ought of that Gold, Which earst they had when thou them didst behold? I liue, and happie liue, but thou art dead, And still shalt bee, till thou be like mee made. Alas! whilst wee are wrapt in Gownes of Earth, And blinde, heere sucke the Aire of Woe beneath, Each thing in Senses Ballances wee wie, And but with Toyle, and Paine the Trueth descrie. Aboue this vaste and admirable Frame, This Temple visible, which World wee name, Within whose Walles so many Lamps doe burne, So many Arches opposite doe turne, Where Elementall Brethren nurse their Strife, And by intestine Warres maintaine their Life, There is a World, a World of perfect Blisse, Pure, immateriall, bright, more farre from this, Than that high Circle which the rest enspheares Is from this dull ignoble Vale of Teares, A World, where all is found, that heere is found, But further discrepant than Heauen and Ground: It hath an Earth, as hath this World of yours, With Creatures peopled, stor'd with Trees, and Flowrs, It hath a Sea, like Saphire Girdle cast, Which decketh of harmonious Shores the Waste, It hath pure Fire, it hath delicious Aire, Moone, Sunne, and Starres, Heauens wonderfully faire: But there Flowrs doe not fade, Trees grow not olde, The Creatures doe not die through Heat nor Colde, Sea there not tossed is, nor Aire made blacke, Fire doth not nurse it selfe on others Wracke; There Heauens bee not constrain'd about to range, For this World hath no neede of any Change: The Minutes grow not Houres, Houres rise not Dayes, Dayes make no Months, but euer-blooming Mayes. Heere I remaine, and hitherward doe tend All who their Spanne of Dayes in Vertue spend: What euer Pleasure this low Place containes, It is a Glance but of what high remaines. Those who (perchance) thinke there can nothing bee Without this wide Expansion which they see, And that nought else mounts Starres Circumference, For that nought else is subject to their Sense, Feele such a Case, as one whom some Abisme Of the Deepe Ocean kept had all his Time: Who borne and nourish'd there, can scarcely dreame That ought can liue without that brinie Streame, Can not beleeue that there be Temples, Towres, Which goe beyond his Caues and dampish Bowres, Or there bee other People, Manners, Lawes, Than them hee finds within the roaring Waues, That sweeter Flowrs doe spring than grow on Rockes, Or Beasts bee which excell the skalie Flockes, That other Elements bee to bee found, Than is the Water, and this Ball of Ground. But thinke that Man from those Abismes were brought, And saw what curious Nature here hath wrought, Did see the Meads, the tall and shadie Woods, The Hilles did see, the cleare and ambling Floods, The diuerse Shapes of Beasts which Kinds foorth bring, The feathred Troupes, that flie and sweetly sing: Did see the Palaces, the Cities faire, The Forme of humane Life, the Fire, the Aire, The brightnesse of the Sunne that dimmes his Sight, The Moone, the gastly Splendors of the Night: What vncouth Rapture would his Minde surprise? How would hee his (late-deare) Resort despise? How would hee muse how foolish hee had beene To thinke nought bee, but what hee there had seene? Why did wee get this high and vaste Desire, Vnto immortall things still to aspire? Why doth our Minde extend it beyond Time, And to that highest Happinesse euen clime? If wee be nought but what to Sense wee seeme, And Dust, as most of Worldlings vs esteeme? Wee bee not made for Earth, though here wee come, More than the Embryon for the Mothers Wombe: It weepes to bee made free, and wee complaine To leaue this loathsome Iayle of Care and Paine, But thou who vulgare Foot-steps dost not trace, Learne to raise vp thy Minde vnto this Place, And what Earth-creeping Mortalles most affect, If not at all to scorne, yet to neglect: O chase not Shadowes vaine, which when obtain'd, Were better lost, than with such Trauell gain'd. Thinke that, on Earth which Humanes Greatnesse call, Is but a glorious Title to liue thrall: That Scepters, Diadems, and Chaires of State, Not in themselues, but to small Mindes are great: How those who loftiest mount, doe hardest light, And deepest Falls bee from the highest Hight; How Fame an Eccho is, how all Renowne Like to a blasted Rose, ere Night falles downe: And though it something were, thinke how this Round Is but a litle Point, which doth it bound. O leaue that Loue which reacheth but to Dust, And in that Loue eternall only trust, And Beautie, which when once it is possest, Can only fill the Soule, and make it blest. Pale Enuie, jealous Emulations, Feares, Sighs, Plaints, Remorse, here haue no Place, nor Teares, False Ioyes, vaine Hopes, here bee not, Hate nor Wrath, What ends all Loue, here most augments it, Death. If such Force had the dimme Glance of an Eye, Which some few Dayes thereafter was to die, That it could make thee leaue all other things, And like the Taper-flie there burne thy Wings? And if a Voyce, of late which could but waile, Such Power had, as through Eares thy Soule to steale? If once thou on that only Faire couldst gaze, What Flames of Loue would hee within thee raise? In what a mazing Maze would it thee bring, To heare but once that Quire celestiall sing? The fairest Shapes on which thy Loue did sease, Which earst did breede Delight, then would displease, Then Discords hoarse were Earths entising Sounds, All Musicke but a Noyse which Sense confounds. This great and burning Glasse that cleares all Eyes, And musters with such Glorie in the Skies, That siluer Starre which with its sober Light, Makes Day oft enuie the eye-pleasing Night, Those golden Letters which so brightly shine In Heauens great Volume gorgeously diuine, The Wonders all in Sea, in Earth, in Aire, Bee but darke Pictures of that Soueraigne Faire, Bee Tongues, which still thus crie into your Eare, (Could yee amidst Worlds Cataracts them heare) From fading things (fond Wights) lift your Desire, And in our Beautie, his vs made admire, If wee seeme faire? ô thinke how faire is Hee, Of whose faire Fairnesse, Shadowes, Steps, we bee. No Shadow can compare it with the Face, No Step with that deare Foot which did it trace; Your Soules immortall are, then place them hence, And doe not drowne them in the Must of Sense: Doe not, ô doe not by false Pleasures Might Depriue them of that true, and sole Delight. That Happinesse yee seeke is not below, Earths sweetest Ioy is but disguised Woe. Heere did shee pause, and with a milde Aspect Did towards mee those lamping Twinnes direct: The wonted Rayes I knew, and thrice essay'd To answere make, thrice faultring Tongue it stay'd. And while vpon that Face I fed my Sight, Mee thought shee vanish'd vp in Titans Light, Who guilding with his Rayes each Hill and Plaine, Seem'd to haue brought the Gold-smiths World againe. TEARES, ON THE DEATH of Mœliades. TEARES, ON THE DEATH of Mœliades. O heauens! then is it true that Thou art gone, THE Name which in these Verses is giuen Prince Henrie, is that which he himselfe in y? Challenges of his Martial Sports, &amp; Mascarads, was wont to vse, Mœliades Prince of the Isles which in Anagramme maketh Miles A DEO And left this woefull Ile her Losse to mone, Mœliades? bright Day-Starre of the West, A Comet, blazing Terrour to the East: And neither that thy Spright so heauenlywise, Nor Bodie (though of Earth) more pure than Skies, Nor royall Stemme, nor thy sweet tender Age, Of adamantine Fates could quench the Rage? O fading Hopes! O short-while-lasting Ioy! Of Earth-borne Man, which one Houre can destroy! Then euen of Vertues Spoyles Death Trophees reares, As if hee gloried most in many Teares. Forc'd by grimme Destines, Heauens neglect our Cryes, Starres seeme set only to acte Tragœdies: And let them doe their Worst, since thou art gone, Raise whom they list to Thrones, enthron'd dethrone, Staine Princely Bowres with Blood, and euen to Gange, In Cypresse sad, glad Hymens Torches change. Ah! thou hast left to liue, and in the Time, When scarce thou blossom'd in thy pleasant Prime, So falles by Northerne Blast a virgine Rose, At halfe that doth her bashfull Bosome close: So a sweet Flourish languishing decayes, That late did blush when kist by Phœbus Rayes: So Phœbus mounting the Meridians Hight, Choack'd by pale Phœbe, faints vnto our Sight, Astonish'd Nature sullen stands to see The Life of all this All, so chang'd to bee, In gloomie Gownes the Starres about deplore, The Sea with murmuring Mountaines beates the Shore, Blacke Darknesse reeles o're all, in thousand Showres The weeping Aire, on Earth her Sorrow powres, That (in a Palsey) quakes to finde so soone Her Louer set, and Night burst foorth ere Noone. If Heauen (alas) ordain'd thee young to die, Why was it not where thou thy Might did'st trie? And to the hopefull World at least set forth Some litle Sparke of thine expected Worth? Mœliades, ô that by Isters Streames, Amongst shrill-sounding Trumpets, flaming Gleames Of warme encrimson'd Swords, and Cannons Roare, Balls thicke as Raine pour'd by the Caspian Shore, Amongst crush'd Lances, ringing Helmes, and Shields, Dismembred Bodies rauishing the Fields, In Turkish Blood made red like Marses Starre, Thou ended hadst thy Life, and Christian Warre! Or as braue Burbon thou hadst made old Rome, Queene of the World, thy Triumphs Place, and Tombe! So Heauens faire Face to the vnborne which reades A Booke had beene of thine illustrous Deedes: So to their Nephewes aged Syres had told The high Exploits perform'd by thee of old, Townes raz'd, and rais'd, victorious, vanquish'd Bands, Fierce Tyrants flying, foyl'd, kill'd, by thy Hands. And in deare Arras, Virgines faire had wrought The Bayes and Trophees to thy Countrey brought: While some new Homer imping Pennes to Fame, Deafe Nilus Dwellers had made heare thy Name. That thou didst not attaine those Honours Spheares, It was not want of Worth, ô no, but Yeares. A Youth more braue, pale Troy with trembling Walles Did neuer see, nor shee whose Name apalles Both Titans golden Bowres, for bloody Fights Mustring on Marses Field such Marse-like Knights. The Heauens had brought thee to the highest Hight, Of Wit, and Courage, shewing all their Might When they thee fram'd: Ay mee! that what is braue On Earth, they as their owne so soone should craue. Mœliades sweet courtly Nymphes deplore, From Thuly to Hydaspes pearlie Shore. When Forth thy Nurse, Forth where thou first didst passe Thy tender Dayes (who smyl'd oft on her Glasse To see thee gaze) Meandring with her Streames, Heard thou hadst left this Round, from Phœbus Beames Shee sought to flie, but forced to returne By neighbour Brookes, Shee gaue her selfe to mourne: And as shee rush'd her Cyclades among, Shee seem'd to plaine, that Heauen had done her wrong. With a hoarse Plaint, Cleyd downe her steepie Rockes, And Tweed through her greene Mountaines cled with Flockes, Did wound the Ocean, murmuring thy Death, The Ocean that roar'd about the Earth, And it to Mauritanian Atlas told, Who shrunke through Griefe, and downe his white Haires roll'd Hudge Streames of Teares, that changed were in Floods, With which hee drown'd the neighbour Plaines and Woods. The lesser Brookes as they did bubbling goe, Did keepe a Consort vnto publike Woe: The Shepheards left their Flockes with downe-cast Eyes, Disdaining to looke vp to angrie Skies: Some broke their Pipes, and some in sweet-sad Layes, Made senslesse things amazed at thy Praise. His Reed Alexis hung vpon a Tree, And with his Teares made Doven great to bee. Mœliades sweet courtly Nymphes deplore, From Thuly to Hydaspes pearlie Shore. Chaste Maides which haunt faire Aganippe Well, And you in Tempes sacred Shade who dwell, Let fall your Harpes, cease Tunes of Ioy to sing, Discheueled make all Parnassus ring With Antheames sad, thy Musicke Phœbus turne In dolefull Plaints, whilst Ioy it selfe doth mourne: Dead is thy Darling, who decor'd thy Bayes, Who oft was wont to cherish thy sweet Layes, And to a Trumpet raise thine amorous Stile, That floting Delos enuie might this Ile. You Acidalian Archers breake your Bowes, Your Brandons quench, with Teares blot Beauties Snowes, And bid your weeping Mother yet againe A second Adons Death, nay, Marses plaine: His Eyes once were your Darts, nay, euen his Name Where euer heard, did euery Heart inflame: Tagus did court his Loue, with golden Streames, Rhein with his Townes, faire Seine, with all shee claimes. But ah (poore Louers) Death did them betrey, And (not suspected) made their Hopes his Prey! Tagus bewailes his Losse, with golden Streames, Rhein with his Townes, faire Seine with all shee claimes. Mœliades sweet courtly Nymphes deplore, From Thuly to Hydaspes pearlie Shore. Delicious Meads, whose checkred Plaine foorth brings, White, golden, azure Flowres, which once were Kings, In mourning Blacke, their shining Colours dye, Bow downe their Heads, whilst sighing Zephyres flye. Queene of the Fields, whose Blush makes blushe the Morne, Sweet Rose, a Princes Death in Purple mourne. O Hyacinthes, for ay your AI keepe still, Nay, with moe Markes of Woe your Leaues now fill: And you, O Flowre of Helens Teares first borne, Into those liquide Pearles againe you turne. Your greene Lockes, Forrests, cut, in weeping Myrrhes, The deadly Cypresse, and Inke-dropping Firres, Your Palmes and Mirtles change; from Shadowes darke Wing'd Syrens waile, and you sad Ecchoes marke The lamentable Accents of their Mone, And plaine that braue Mœliades is gone. Stay Skie thy turning Course, and now become A stately Arche, vnto the Earth his Tombe: Ouer which ay the watrie Iris keepe, And sad Electras Sisters which still weepe. Mœliades sweet courtly Nymphes deplore, From Thuly to Hydaspes pearlie Shore. Deare Ghost, forgiue these our vntimely Teares, By which our louing Minde, though weake, appeares, Our Losse not Thine (when wee complaine) wee weepe, For thee the glistring Walles of Heauen doe keepe, Beyond the Planets Wheeles, aboue that Source Of Spheares, that turnes the lower in its Course, Where Sunne doth neuer set, nor vgly Night Euer appeares in mourning Garments dight: Where Boreas stormie Trumpet doth not sound, Nor Cloudes in Lightnings bursting, Minds astound. From Cares cold Climates farre, and hote Desire, Where Time is banish'd, Ages ne're expire: Amongst pure Sprights enuironed with Beames, Thou think'st all things below to bee but Dreames, And joy'st to looke downe to the azur'd Barres Of Heauen, indented all with streaming Starres; And in their turning Temples to behold, In siluer Robe the Moone, the Sunne in Gold, Like young Eye-speaking Louers in a Dance, With Majestie by Turnes retire, aduance, Thou wondrest Earth to see hang like a Ball, Clos'd in the gastly Cloyster of this All: And that poore Men should proue so madly fond, To tosse themselues for a small Foot of Ground. Nay, that they euen dare braue the Powers aboue, From this base Stage of Change, that cannot moue. All worldly Pompe and Pride thou seest arise Like Smoake, that scattreth in the emptie Skies. Other Hilles and Forrests, other sumptuous Towres, Amaz'd thou find'st, excelling our poore Bowres, Courts voyde of Flatterie, of Malice Mindes, Pleasure which lasts, not such as Reason blindes: Farre sweeter Songs thou hear'st and Carrolings, Whilst Heauens doe dance, and Quire of Angells sings, Than moldie Mindes could faine, euen our Annoy (If it approach that Place) is chang'd in Ioy. Rest blessed Spright, rest saciate with the Sight Of him, whose Beames both dazell and delight, Life of all Liues, Cause of each other Cause, The Spheare, and Center, where the Minde doth pause: Narcissus of himselfe, himselfe the Well, Louer, and Beautie, that doth all excell. Rest happie Ghost, and wonder in that Glasse, Where seene is all that shall be, is, or was, While shall be, is, or was doe passe away, And nought remaine but an Eternall Day. For euer rest, thy Praise Fame may enroule In golden Annalles, whilst about the Pole The slow Boötes turnes, or Sunne doth rise With skarlet Scarfe, to cheare the mourning Skies: The Virgines to thy Tombe may Garlands beare Of Flowres, and on each Flowre let fall a Teare. Mœliades sweet courtly Nymphes deplore, From Thuly to Hydaspes pearlie Shore. Sonnet. [A passing Glance, a Lightning long the Skies] A passing Glance, a Lightning long the Skies That vsh'ring Thunder dies straight to our Sight, A Sparke, of Contraries which doth arise, Then drownes in the huge Depthes of Day and Night: Is this small-Small call'd Life, held in such Price Of blinded Wights, who nothing judge aright, Of Parthian Shaft so swift is not the Flight As Life, that wastes it selfe, and liuing dies. O! what is humane Greatnesse, Valour, Wit? What fading Beautie, Riches, Honour, Praise? To what doth serue in golden Thrones to sit, Thrall Earths vaste Round, triumphall Arches raise? All is a Dreame, learne in this Princes Fall, In whome (saue Death) nought mortall was at all. EPITAPH Stay Passenger, see where enclosed lyes, The Paragon of Princes, fairest Frame, Time, Nature, Place, could show to mortal Eyes In Worth, Wit, Vertue, Miracle to Fame: At lest that Part the Earth of him could clame, This Marble holds (hard like the Destinies) For as to his braue Spirit, and glorious Name, The One the World, the other fills the Skies. Th' immortall Amaranthus, princely Rose, Sad Violet, and that sweet Flowre that beares, In Sangvine Spots the Tenor of our Woes, Spred on this Stone, &amp; wash it with thy Teares, Then go and tell from Gades vnto Inde, Thou saw where Earths Perfections were confinde. VRANIA, OR Spirituall Poems. [i] [Triumphing Chariots, Statues, Crownes of Bayes] Triumphing Chariots, Statues, Crownes of Bayes, Skie-threatning Arches, the Rewards of Worth, Workes heauenly wise in sweet harmonious Layes, Which Sprights diuine vnto the World set forth: States, which ambitious Mindes with Blood doe raise From frozen Tanais to Sunne-gilded Gange, Giganticke Frames held Wonders rarely strange, Like Spiders Webbes, are made the Sport of Dayes. All only constant is in constant Change, What done is, is vndone, and when vndone, Into some other Fashion doth it range: Thus goes the floting World beneath the Moone, Where for (my Minde) aboue Time, Motion, Place, Thee raise, and Steps vnknowne to Nature Trace. [ii] [Too long I follow'd haue my fond Desire] Too long I follow'd haue my fond Desire, And too long painted on the Ocean Streames: Too long Refreshment sought amidst the Fire, And hunted Ioyes, which to my Soule were Blames. Ah! when I had what most I did admire, And seene of Lifes Delights the last Extreames, I found all but a Rose hedg'd with a Bryer, A Nought, a Thought, a Show of mocking Dreames. Hencefoorth on thee mine only Good I'll thinke, For only thou canst grant what I doe craue, Thy Naile my Penne shall bee, thy Blood mine Inke, Thy Winding-shee my Paper, Studie Graue. And till that Soule forth of this Bodie flie, No Hope I'll haue but only onelie Thee. [iii] [To spreade the azure Canopie of Heauen] To spreade the azure Canopie of Heauen, And make it twinckle all with Spanges of Gold, To place this pondrous Globe of Earth so euen, That it should all, and nought should it vphold: To giue strange Motions to the Planets seuen, And Ioue to make so meeke, and Mars so bold, To temper what is moist, drie, hote, and cold, Of all their Iarres that sweet Accords are giuen. Lord, to thy Wit is nought, nought to thy Might, But that thou shouldst (thy Glorie laid aside) Come basely in Mortalitie to bide, And die for them deseru'd eternall Plight, A Wonder is, so farre aboue our Wit, That Angells stand amaz'd to thinke on it. [iv] [Come forth, come forth, yee blest triumphing Bands] Come forth, come forth, yee blest triumphing Bands, Faire Citizens of that immortall Towne: Come see that King, who all this All commands, Now (ouercharg'd with Loue) die for his owne. Looke on those Nailes which pierce his Feete and Hands, What a strange Diademe his Browes doth crowne? Beholde his pallide Face, his Eyes which sowne, And what a Throng of Thieues him mocking stands: Come forth yee Empyrean Troupes, come forth, Preserue this sacred Blook, which Earth adornes, Gather those liquide Roses from his Thornes, O! to bee lost they bee of too much Worth: For Streames, Iuice, Baulme, they are, which quench, killes, charmes, Of God, Death, Hell, the Wrath, the Life, the Harmes. [i] [Soule, which to Hell wast thrall] Soule, which to Hell wast thrall, Hee, hee for thine Offence Did suffer Death, who could not die at all: O soueraigne Excellence, O Life of all that liues, Eternall Bountie, which all Goodnesse giues, How could Death mount so hie? No Wit this Point can reach, Faith onely doth vs teach, For vs hee died, at all who could not die. [v] [If such passing Beautie, choise Delights] If such passing Beautie, choise Delights, The Architect of this great Round did frame This Pallace visible, which World we name? (Yet sillie Mansion but of mortall Wights) How many Wonders? what amazing Lights, Must that triumphing Seate of Glorie claime? Which doth transcend all this great Alls high Hights, Of Whose bright Sunne ours heere is but a Beame? O blest Abode! ô happie dwelling Place! Where visiblie th' Inuisible doth raigne, Blest People, who doe see true Beauties Face, With whose darke Shadowes Hee but Earth doth daigne, All Ioy is but Annoy, all Concord Strife, Match'd with your endlesse Blisse, and happie Life. [ii] [Loue which is heere, a Care] Loue which is heere, a Care That Wit and Will doth marre, Vncertaine Truce, and a most certaine Warre, A shrill tempestuous Winde, Which doth disturbe the Minde, And like wilde Waues our Dessignes all commoue: Among those Sprights aboue Which see their Makers Face, It a Contentment is, a quiet Peace, A Pleasure voide of Griefe, a constant Rest, Eternall Ioy, which nothing can molest. [vi] [What haplesse Hap had I now to bee borne] What haplesse Hap had I now to bee borne, In these vnhappie Times, and dying Dayes, Of this else-doating World? when Good decayes, Loue is quench'd forth, and Vertue held a Scorne. When such are onely priz'd, by wretched Wayes Who with a golden Fleece them can adorne, When Auarice, and Lust, are counted Praise, And noble Mindes liue Orphane-like forlorne. Why was not I into that golden Age, When Gold yet was not knowne? and those blacke Artes, By which base Mortalles vildely play their Parts, And staine with horride Actes Earths stately Stage? Then to haue beene, Heauen, it had beene my Blisse, But blesse mee now, and take mee soone from this. [vii] [Thrise happie hee, who by some shadie Groue] Thrise happie hee, who by some shadie Groue Farre from the clamarous World doth liue his owne, Though solitare, yet who is not alone, But doth conuerse with that Eternall Loue. O how more sweet is Birds harmonious Mone, Or the soft Sobbings of the widow'd Doue? Than those smoothe Whisp'rings neare a Princes Throne, Which Good make doubtfull, doe the Euill approue. O how more sweet is Zephyres wholesome Breath, And Sighs perfum'd, which doe the Flowres vnfold, Tnan that Applause vaine Honour doth bequeath? How sweete are Streames to Poyson drunke in Gold? The World is full of Horrours, Falshoods, Slights, Woods silent Shades haue only true Delights. [viii] [Why (Worldlings) doe ye trust fraile Honours Dreames?] Why (Worldlings) doe ye trust fraile Honours Dreames? And leane to guilded Glories which decay? Why doe yee toyle to registrate your Names In ycie Columnes, which soone melt away? True Honour is not here, that Place it claimes, Where blacke-brow'd Night doth not exile the Day, Nor no farre-shining Lampe diues in the Sea, But an eternall Sunne spreades lasting Beames. There it attendeth you, where spotlesse Bands Of Sprights, stand gazing on their soueraigne Blisse, Where Yeeres not hold it in their cankring Hands, But who once noble euer noble is: Looke home, lest he your weakned Wit make thrall, Who Edens foolish Gard'ner earst made fall. [iii] [Astrea in this Time] Astrea in this Time Now doth not liue, but is fled vp to Heauen; Or if shee liue, it is not without Crime That shee doth vse her Power, And shee is no more Virgine, but a Whoure, Whoure prostitute for Gold: For shee doth neuer holde her Ballance euen, And when her Sword is roll'd, The Bad, Injurious, False, shee not o'rethrowes, But on the Innocent lets fall her Blowes. [ix] [What serues it to bee good? Goodnesse by thee] What serues it to bee good? Goodnesse by thee The Holy-wise is thought a Foole to bee, For thee the Man to Temperance inclin'de, Is held but of a base and abject Minde, The Continent is thought for thee but cold, Who yet was good, that euer died old? The pittifull who others feares to kill, Is kill'd himselfe, and Goodnesse doth him ill: The meeke and humble Man who cannot braue, By thee is to some Giants Brood made Slaue. Poore Goodnesse, thine thou to such Wrongs sett'st forth, That ô! I feare mee, thou art nothing worth: And when I looke to Earth, and not to Heauen, Ere I were turned Doue, I would bee Rauen. [i] [Great GOD, whom wee with humble Thoughts adore] Great GOD, whom wee with humble Thoughts adore, Eternall, infinite, almightie King, Whose Pallace Heauen transcends, whose Throne before Archangells serue, and Seraphins doe sing: Of Nought who wrought all that with wondring Eyes Wee doe behold within this spacious Round, Who mak'st the Rockes to rocke, and stand the Skies, At whose Command the horride Thunders sound: Ah! spare vs Wormes, weigh not how wee (alas) Euill to our Selues, against thy Lawes rebell, Wash off those Spots, which still in Conscience Glasse (Though wee bee loth to looke) wee see too well. Deseru'd Reuenge, ô doe not, doe not take, If thou reuenge, what shall abide thy Blow? Passe shall this World, this World which thou didst make, Which should not perish till thy Trumpet blow. For who is hee whom Parents Sinne not staines? Or with his owne Offence is not defil'd? Though Iustice Ruine threaten, Iustice Raines Let Mercie hold, and bee both just and milde. Lesse are our Faults farre farre than is thy Loue, O! what can better seeme thy Pow'r diuine? Than those who Euill deserue thy Goodnesse proue? And where thou thunder shouldst there faire to shine? Then looke, and pittie, pittying forgiue Vs guiltie Slaues, or Seruants, at thy Will, Slaues, if (alas) thou look'st how wee doe liue, Or doing nought at all, or doing ill: Of an vngratefull Minde a foule Effect, But if thy Gifts, which largely heretofore Thou hast vpon vs powr'd, thou doest respect? Wee bee thy Seruants, nay, than Seruants more, Thy Children, yes, and Children dearly bought, But what strange Chance vs of this Lot bereaues? Vile Rebells, ô! how basely are wee brought? Whom Grace made Children, Sinne hath now made Slaues: Sinne Slaues hath made, but let thy Grace Sinne thrall, That in our Wrongs thy mercie may appeare, Thy Wisdome not so weake is, Pow'r so small, But thousand Wayes they can make Men thee feare. O Wisdome bound-lesse! admirable Grace! Grace, Wisdome, which doe dazell Reasons Eye, And could Heauens King bring from his placelesse Place, On this infamous Stage of Woe, to die: To die our Death, and with the sacred Streame Of Bloud, and Water, gushing from his Side, To expiate that Sinne, and deadly Blame, Contriued first by our First Parents Pride. Thus thy great Loue, and Pittie, heauenly King, Loue, Pittie, which so well our Losse preuents, Could euen of Euill it selfe all Goodnesse bring, And sad Beginnings cheare with glad Euents. O Loue, and Pittie! ill knowne of these Times, O Loue and Pittie! carefull of our Blisse, O Goodnesse! with the hainous Actes and Crimes Of this blacke Age, that almost vanquish'd is: Make this excessiue ardour of thy Loue, So warme our Coldnesse, so our Liues renew, That wee from Sinne, Sinne may from vs remoue, Wit may our Will, Faith may our Wit subdue. Let thy pure Loue burne vp all mortall Lust, That Band of Ills which thralles our better Part, And fondly makes vs worship fleshly Dust, In stead of Thee in Temple of our Heart. Grant, when at last the Spright shall leaue this Tombe, This loathsome Shop of Sinne, and Mansion blinde, And (call'd) before thy Royall Seat doth come, It may a Sauiour, not a Iudge, thee finde. MADRIGALLS, AND Epigrammes. [i] The Statue of Medvsa. Of that Medvsa strange, Who those that did her see in Rockes did change, None Image caru'd is this; Medvsas selfe it is, For whilst at Heat of Day, To quench her Thirst Shee by this Spring did stay, Her curling Snakes beholding in this Glasse, Life did Her leaue, and thus transform'd Shee was. [ii] The Trojane Horse. A horse I am, whom Bit, Raine, Rod, nor Spurre, not feare; When I my Riders beare, Within my Wombe, not on my Backe they sit: No Streames I drinke, nor care for Grasse, nor Corne, Arte mee a Monster wrought, All Natures Workes to scorne: A Mother, I was without Mother borne, In End all arm'd my Father I forth brought: What thousand Ships, and Champions of Renowne, Could not doe free, I captiue raz'd a Towne. [iii] A Louers Heauen. Those Starres, nay Sunnes, which turne So stately in their Spheares, And daz'ling doe not burne, The beautie of the Mone Which on those Cheekes appeares, The Harmonie which to that Voyce is giuen, Make mee thinke yee are Heauen: If Heauen yee bee? ô that by pow'rfull Charmes I Atlas were, to holde you in mine Armes! [iv] Deepe Impression of Loue. Whom raging Dog doth bite, Hee doth in Water still That Cerberus Image see; Loue Mad (perhaps) when he my Heart did smite, (More to dissemble Ill) Transform'd himselfe in thee, For euer since thou present art to mee: No Spring there is, no Floud, nor other Place, Where I (alas) not see thy heauenly Face. [v] The Pourtrait of Mars and Venvs. Faire Paphos wanton Queene, Not drawne in White and Red, Is truely heere, as when in Vvlcans Bed She was of all Heauens laughing Senate seene: Gaze on her Haire, and Eine, Her Browes, the Bowes of Loue, Her backe with Lillies spred: And yee should see her turne, and sweetly moue, But that Shee neither so will doe, nor darre, For feare to wake the angrie God of Warre. [vi] Iölas Epitaph. Here deare Iölas lies, Who whilst hee liu'd in Beautie did surpasse That Boy, whose heauenly Eyes Brought Cypris from aboue, Or him till Death who look'd in watrie Glasse, Euen Iudge the God of Loue: And if the Nymphe once held of him so deare, Dorine the faire, would heere but shed one Teare, Thou shouldst (in Natures Scorne) A purple Flowre see of this Marble borne. [vii] Vpon the Death of a Linnet. If cruell Death had Eares, Or could bee pleas'd by Songs? This wing'd Musician liu'd had many yeares, And Chloris mine had neuer wept these Wrongs: For when it first tooke Breath, The Heauens their Notes did vnto it bequeath: And (if that Samians sentence bee found true) Amphion in this Body liu'd of new: But Death, for that hee nothing spares, nought heares, As hee doth Kings, it kill'd, ô Griefe! ô Teares! [viii] Alcons Kisse. What others at their Eare Two Pearles Camilla at he Nose did weare, Which Alcon who nought saw (For Loue is blinde) robb'd with a prettie Kisse, But hauing knowne his Misse, And felt what Ore hee from that Mine did draw, When shee to charge againe him did desire, Hee fled, and said, foule Water quenched Fire. [ix] Icarvs. Whilst with audacious Wings I sprang those airie Wayes, And fill'd (a Monster new) with Dread and Feares, The feathred People, and their Eagle Kings: Dazel'd with Phœbus Rayes, And charmed with the Musicke of the Spheares, When Pennes could moue no more, and Force did faile, I measur'd by a Fall these loftie Bounds; Yet doth Renowne my Losses counteruaile, For still the Shore my braue Attempt resounds: A Sea, an Element doth beare my Name, Who hath so vaste a Tombe in Place, or Fame? [x] Cherries. My Wanton, weepe no more The losing of your Cherries, Those, and farre sweeter Berries, Your Sister in good store Hath, spred on Lips, and Face: Be glad, kisse but with me, and hold your peace. [xi] Of Thavmantia, beholding her selfe in a Marble. World, wonder not that I Engraue thus in may Brest This Angell Face, which mee bereaues of Rest: Since things euen wanting Sense, cannot denie To lodge so deare a Guest, And this hard Marble Stone Receiues the same, and loues, but cannot grone. [xii] Loue suffereth no Parasol. Those Eyes, deare Eyes, bee Spheares, Where two bright Sunnes are roll'd, That faire Hand to behold, Of whitest Snowe appeares: Then while yee coylie stand, To hide from mee those Eyes, Sweet, I would you aduise To choose some other Fanne than that white Hand: For if yee doe, for Trueth most true this know, That Sunnes ere long must needes consume warme Snow. [xiii] Sleeping Beautie. O Sight! too dearely bought, Shee sleepes, and though those Eyes, Which lighten Cupids Skies, Bee clos'd, yet such a Grace Enuironeth that Place, That I through Wonder to grow faint am brought: Sunnes, if ecclips'd yee haue such Power diuine? O! how can I endure you when yee shine? [xiv] The qualitie of a Kisse. The Kisse with so much Strife, Which I late got (sweet Heart) Was it a Signe of Death, or was it Life? Of Life it could not bee, For I by it did sigh my Soule in thee, Nor was it Death, Death doth no Ioy impart: Thou silent stand'st, ah! what thou didst bequeath, To mee a dying Life was, liuing Death. [xv] Of Phillis. In Peticote of Greene, Her Haire about her Eine, Phillis beneath an Oake Sate milking her faire Flocke: Among that strained Moysture (rare Delight!) Her Hand seem'd Milke in Milke, it was so white. [xvi] Kisses desired. Though I with strange Desire To kisse those rosie Lips am set on Fire, Yet will I cease to craue Sweet Touches in such store, As hee who long before From Lesbia them in thousands did receaue; Heart mine, but once mee kisse, And I by that sweet Blisse Euen sweare to cease you to importune more, Poore one no Number is: Another Word of mee yee shall not heare, After one Kisse, but still one Kisse, my Deare. [xvii] Of Dametas. Dametas dream'd he saw his Wife at Sport, And found that sight was through the hornie Port. [xviii] The Canon. When first the Canon from her gaping Throte, Against the Heauen her roaring Sulphure shote, Ioue wak'ned with the Noyce, and ask'd with Wonder, What mortall Wight had stollen from him his Thunder, His christall Towres hee fear'd, but Fire, and Aire, So deepe, did stay the Ball from mounting there. [xix] Apelles enamour'd of Campaspe, Alexanders Mistresse. Poore Painter, whilst I sought To counterfaite by Arte The fairest Frame that Nature euer wrought, And hauing limm'd each Part Except her matchlesse Eyes: Scarce on those Twinnes I gaz'd, As Lightning falles from Skies, When straight my Hand benumm'd was, Mind amaz'd: And ere that Pincell halfe them had exprest, Loue all had drawne, no, grauen within my Brest. [xx] Campaspe. On Starres shall I exclame, Which thus my Fortune change? Or shall I else reuenge Vpon my selfe this shame? Vnconstant Monarch, or shall I thee blame? Who let'st Apelles proue The sweet Delights of Alexanders Loue; No, Starres, my selfe, and thee, I all forgiue, And joye that thus I liue: Kings know not Beautie, hence mine was despis'd, The Painter did, and mee hee dearly priz'd. [xxi] Vnpleasant Musicke. In Fields Ribaldo stray'd, Mayes Tapestrie to see, And hearing on a Tree A Cuckooe sing, hee sigh'd, and softly said, Loe, how (alas) euen Birds sit mocking mee. [xxii] A Iest. In a most holy Church, a holy Man, Vnto a holy Saint, with Visage wan, And Eyes like Fountaines, mumbled forth a Prayer, And with strange Words, and Sighes, made blacke the Aire: And hauing long so stay'd, and long long pray'd, A thousand Crosses on himselfe hee lay'd, Then with some sacred Beads hung on his Arme, His Eyes, his Mouth, Brest, Temples did hee charme. Thus not content (strange Worship hath none End) To kisse the Earth at last hee did pretend, And bowing downe, besought with humble Grace An aged Woman neare to giue some Place: Shee turn'd, and turning up her Pole beneath, Said, Sir, kisse heere, for it is all but Earth. [xxiii] Narcissvs. Flouds cannot quench my Flames, ah! in this Well I burne, not drowne, for what I cannot tell. [xxiv] To Thavmantia singing. Is it not too too much Thou late didst to mee proue, A Basiliske of Loue? And didst my Wits bewitch: Vnlesse (to cause more Harme) Made Syrene too thou with thy Voyce mee charme? Ah! though thou so my Reason didst controule, That to thy Lookes I could not proue a Mole: Yet doe mee not that Wrong, As not to let mee turne Aspe to thy Song. [xxv] Of her Dog. When her deare Bosome clips That litle Curre, which faunes to touch her Lips, Or when it is his Hap To lie lapp'd in her Lap, O! it growes Noone with mee, With hotter-pointed Beames My burning Planet streames, What Rayes were earst, in Lightnings changed bee: When oft I muse, how I to those Extreames Am brought, I finde no Cause, except that shee In Loues bright Zodiacke hauing trac'd each Roome, To fatall Syrius now at last is come. [xxvi] A Kisse. Harke happie Louers, harke, This first and last of Ioyes, This Sweetner of Annoyes, This Nectare of the Gods, Yee call a Kisse, is with it selfe at ods: And halfe so sweet is not In equall Measure got, At Light of Sunne, as it is in the Darke, Harke, happie Louers, harke. [xxvii] Cornucopia. If for one only Horne Which Nature to him gaue, So famous is the noble Vnicorne? What Praise should that Man haue, Whose Head a Ladie braue Doth with a goodlie Paire at once adorne? [xxviii] Of Amintas. Over a christall Source Amintas layde his Face, Of popling Streames to see the restlesse Course: But scarce hee had o'reshadowed the Place, When (spying in the Ground a Childe arise, Like to himselfe in Stature, Face, and Eyes) Hee rose o'rejoy'd, and cried, Deare Mates approch, see whom I haue descried, The Boy of whom strange Stories Shepheards tell (Oft-called Hylas) dwelleth in this Well. [xxix] Pamphilvs. Some, Ladies wed, some loue, and some adore them, I like their wanton Sport, then care not for them. [xxx] Vpon a Glasse. If thou wouldst see Threedes purer than the Gold, Where Loue his Wealth doth show? But take this Glasse, and thy faire Haire behold: If Whitenesse thou wouldst see more white than Snow, And reade on Wonders Booke? Take but this Glasse, and on thy Forehead looke: Wouldst thou in Winter see a crimsin Rose, Whose Thornes doe hurt each Heart? Looke but in Glasse how thy sweet Lips doe close: Wouldst thou see Planets which all Good impart, Or Meteores diuine? But take this Glasse, and gaze upon thine Eine: No, Planets, Rose, Snow, Gold, cannot compare With you, deare Eyes, Lips, Browes, and amber Haire. [xxxi] Of a Bee. As an audacious Knight Come with some Foe to fight, His Sword doth brandish, makes his Armour ring: So this prowde Bee (at home (perhaps) a King) Did buzzing flie about, And (Tyrant) after thy faire Lip did sting: O Champion strange as stout! Who hast by Nature found, Sharpe Armes, and Trumpet shrill, to sound, and wound. [xxxii] Of that same [A Bee]. O doe not kill that Bee That thus hath wounded thee, (Sweet) it was no Despight, But Hue did him deceaue: For when thy Lips did close, Hee deemed them a Rose, What wouldst thou further craue? Hee wanting Wit, and blinded with Delight, Would faine haue kiss'd, but Mad with Ioy did bite. [xxxiii] Of a Kisse. Ah! of that cruell Bee Thy Lips haue suckt too much: For when they mine did touch, I found that both they hurt, and sweetned, mee: This by the Sting they haue, And that they of the Honey doe receaue: Deare Kisse, else by what Arte Couldst thou at once both please and wound my Heart? [xxxiv] Idmon to Venvs. If (Acidalias Queene) Thou quench in mee thy Torch, And with the same Thaumantias Heart shalt scorch; Each Yeere a Mirtle Tree Heere I doe vow to consecrate to thee: And when the Meads grow greene, I will of sweetest Flowrs Weaue thousand Garlands, to adorne thy Bowrs. [xxxv] A Louers Plaint. In midst of silent Night, When Men, Birds, Beasts, doe rest, With Loue, and Feare possest To Heauen, and Flore, I count my heauie Plight. Againe with roseate Wings When Morne peepes forth, and Philomela sings, Then Voyde of all Reliefe, Doe I renew my Griefe: Day followes Night, Night Day, whilst still I proue, That Heauen is deafe, Flore carelesse of my Loue. [xxxvi] His Firebrand. Leaue Page that slender Torch, And in this gloomie Night Let only shine the Light Of Loues hote Brandon, which my Heart doth scorch: A Sigh, or Blast of Wind, My Teares, or Droppes of Raine, May that at once make blinde; Whilst this like Ætna burning shall remaine. [xxxvii] Daphnis Vow. When Sunne doth bring the Day From the Hesperian Sea, Or Moone her Coach doth rolle Aboue the Northerne Pole, When Serpents can not hisse, And Louers shall not kisse: Then may it be, but in no time till then, That Daphnis can forget his Orienne. [xxxviii] Of Nisa. Nisa Palemons Wife him weeping told, Hee kept not Grammer Rules, now beeing old: For why (quoth shee) Position false make yee, Putting a short thing where a long should bee. [xxxix] Beauties Idea. Who would Perfections faire Idea see, Let him come looke on Chloris sweet with mee; White is her Haire, her Teeth white, white her Skinne, Blacke bee her Eyes, her Eye-browes, Cupids Inne: Her Lockes, her Body, Hands, doe long appeare, But Teeth short, Bellie short, short either Eare; The Space twixt Shoulders, Eyes, is wide, Browes wide, Straite Waste, the Mouth straite, and her virgine Pride: Thicke are her Lips, Thighs, with Banckes swelling there, Her Nose is small, small Fingers, and her Haire, Her sugred Mouth, her Cheekes, her Nailes, bee red, Litle her Foot, Pap litle, and her Hed. Such Venus was, such was the Flame of Troy, Such Chloris is, my Hope, and only Ioy. [xl] Cratons Death. Amidst the Waues profound, Farre farre from all Reliefe, The honest Fisher Craton, ah! is drownd Into his litle Skife: The Boords of which did serue him for a Beare, So that to the blacke World when hee came neare, Of him no Waftage greedie Charon got, For hee in his owne Boat Did passe that Floud, by which the Gods doe sweare. [xli] Armelins Epitaph. Neare to this Eglantine Enclosed lies the milke-white Armeline: Once Chloris onlie Ioye, Now onlie her annoy; Who enuied was of the most happie Swaines, That keepe their Flocks in Mountaines, Dales, or Plaines: For oft shee bare the wanton in her Arme, And oft her Bed, and Bosome did he warme: Now when vnkindlie Fates did him destroy, Blest Dog he had the Grace, With Teares for him that Chloris wet her Face. [xlii] The Statue of Venvs sleeping. Breake not my sweet Repose Thou, whom free Will, or Chance, brings to this Place, Let Lids these Comets close, O doe not seeke to see their shining Grace: For when mine Eyes thou seest, they thine will blinde, And thou shalt parte, but leaue thy Heart behinde. [xliii] Lillas Prayer. Loue, if thou wilt once more That I to thee returne, (Sweete God) make me not burne For quiuering Age, that doth spent Dayes deplore: Nor doe not wound my Hart For some vnconstant Boy, Who ioyes to loue, yet makes of Loue a Toy: But (ah) if I must prooue thy golden Dart? Of grace O let mee finde A sweet young Louer with an aged Mind. Thus Lilla pray'd, and Idas did replie (Who heard) Deare haue thy wish, for such am I. [xliv] The vnkindnesse of Rora. Whilst sighing forth his Wrongs, In sweet, though dolefull Songs, Alexis seekes to charme his Roras Eares, The Hills are heard to mone, To sigh each Spring appeares, Trees, euen hard Trees, through Rine distill their Teares, And soft growes euery Stone: But Teares, Sighes, Songs, can not faire Rora moue, Prowde of his Plaints shee glories in his Loue. [xlv] Antheas Gift. This virgine Locke of Haire To Idmon Anthea giues, Idmon for whom shee liues, Though oft shee mixe his Hopes with cold Despaire: This now, but absent if hee constant proue, With Gift more deare shee vowes to meet his Loue. [xlvi] To Thavmantia. Come, let vs liue, and loue, And kisse, Thaumantia mine, I shall the Elme bee, bee to mee the Vine, Come let vs teach new Billing to the Doue: Nay, to augment our Blisse, Let Soules euen other kisse, Let Loue a Worke-man bee, Vndoe, distemper, and his Cunning proue, Of Kisses three make one, of one make three: Though Moone, Sunne, Starres, bee Bodies farre more bright, Let them not vaunt they match vs in Delight. [xlvii] Epitaph. This deare (though not respected) Earth doth hold One for his Worth, whose Tombe should bee of Gold. [xlviii] Of Lida. Svch Lida is that who Her sees Through Enuie, or through Loue straight dies. [xlix] A Wish. To forge to mightie Ioue The Thunder-bolts aboue, Nor on this Round below Rich Midas Skill to know, And make all Gold I touch, I doe not craue, nor other Cunning such: For all those Artes bee vnderneath the Skie, I wish but Phillis Lapidare to bee. [l] A Louers Day and Night. Bright Meteore of Day, For mee in Thetis Bowres for euer staye: Night, to this flowrie Globe Ne're show for mee thy starre-embrodred Robe; My Night, my Day, doe not proceede from you But hang on Miras Browe: For when shee lowres, and hides from mee her Eyes, Midst clearest Day I finde blacke Night arise, When smyling shee againe those Twinnes doth turne, In midst of Night I finde Noones Torch to burne. [li] The Statue of Adonis. When Venus longst that Plaine This Parian Adon saw, Shee sigh'd, and said, What Power breakes Destines Law, World mourned Boy, and makes thee liue againe? Then with stretcht Armes shee ran him to enfold: But when shee did behold The Bore, whose snowie Tuskes did threaten Death, Feare closed vp her Breath: Who can but grant then that these Stones doe liue, Sith this bred Loue, and that a Wound did giue? [lii] Clorvs to a Groue. Old Oake, and you thicke Groue, I euer shall you loue, With these sweet-smelling Briers, For Briers, Oake, Groue, yee crowned my Desires, When vnderneath your Shade I left my Woe, and Flore her Maidenhead. [liii] A Couplet encomiasticke. Loue, Cypris, Phœbus, will feede, decke, and crowne, Thy Heart, Browes, Verse, with Flames, with Flowrs, Renowne. [liv] An other [Couplet encomiasticke]. Thy Muse not-able, full, il-lustred Rimes, Make thee the Poet-Aster of our Times. [lv] The Rose. Flowre, which of Adons Blood Sprang, when of that cleare Flood Which Venus wept, an other white was borne, The sweet Cynarean Youth thou right dost show: But this sharpe-pointed Thorne, Which doth (so prowde) about thy Crimsin grow, What doth it represent? Boares Tuskes (perhaps) his snowie Flancke which rent: O Show of Showes! of vnesteemed Worth, Which both what kill'd, and what was kill'd sett'st forth. [lvi] To a Riuer. Sith shee will not that I Show to the World my Ioy, Thou who oft mine Annoy Hast heard (deare Flood) tell Thetis Nymphettes bright, That not a happier Wight Doth breath beneath the Skie: More sweet, more white, more faire, Lips, Hands, and amber Haire, Tell none did euer touch; A smaller, daintier Waste Tell neuer was embrac't: But Peace, sith shee forbids thou tell'st too much. [lvii] Thaïs Metamorphose. In Briareus hudge Thaïs wish'd shee might change Her Man, and pray'd him herefore not to grudge, Nor fondly thinke it strange: For if (said shee) I might the Parts dispose, I wish you not an hundreth Armes, nor Hands, But hundreth Things, like those, With which Priapus in our Garden stands. [lviii] Vpon a Baye Tree, not long since growing in the Ruines of Virgils Tombe. Those Stones which once had Trust Of Maros sacred Dust, Which now of their first Beautie spoylde are seene, That they due Praise not want, Inglorious and remaine, A Delian Tree (faire Natures only Plant) Now courtes, and shadowes with her Tresses greene: Sing Iö Pæan, yee of Phœbus Traine, Though Enuie, Auarice, Time, your Tombes throw downe, With Maiden Lawrells Nature will them crowne. [lix] Epitaph. Then Death thee hath beguild Alectos first borne Child? Thou who didst thrall all Lawes Then against Wormes canst not maintaine thy Cause? Yet Wormes (more iust than thou) now doe no Wrong, Sith all doe wonder they thee spar'd so long, For though from Life but lately thou didst passe, Ten Springs are gone since thou corrupted was. [lx] Floras Flowre. Venus doth loue the Rose, Apollo those deare Flowrs Which were his Paramours, The Queene of sable Skies, The subtile Lunaries, But Flore likes none of those, For faire to Her no Flowre seemes saue the Lillie: And why? because one Letter turnes it P. [lxi] Melampvs Epitaph. All that a Dog could haue The good Melampus had: Nay, hee had more than what in Beasts wee craue, For hee could playe the Braue, And often like a Thraso sterne goe Mad: And if yee had not seene, but heard him barke, Yee would haue sworne hee was your Parish Clarke. [lxii] Kalas Complaint. Kala old Mopsus Wife, Kala with fairest Face, (For whom the Neighbour Swaines oft were at Strife) As shee to milke her milke-white Flocke did tend, Sigh'd with a heauie Grace, And said, What Wretch like mee doth leade her Life? I see not how my Taske can haue an End: All Day I draw these streaming Dugs in Fold, All Night mine emptie Husbands soft and cold. [lxiii] The Happinesse of a Flea. How Happier is that Flea Which in thy Brest doth playe, Than that pied Butterflie Which courtes the Flame, and in the same doth die? That hath a light Delight (Poore Foole) contented only with a Sight, When this doth sporte, and swell with dearest Food, And if hee die, hee Knight-like dies in Blood. [lxiv] Of that same [Flea]. Poore Flea, then thou didst die, Yet by so faire a Hand, That thus to die was Destine to command: Thou die didst, yet didst trie A Louers last Delight, To vault on virgine Plaines, Her kisse, and bite: Thou diedst, yet hast thy Tombe Betweene those Pappes, ô deare and stately Roome! Flea, happier farre, more blest, Than Phœnix burning in his spicie Nest. [lxv] Linas Virginitie. Who Lina weddeth, shall most happie bee, For hee a Maide shall finde, Though Maiden none bee shee, A Girle, or Boy, beneath her Waste confinde: And though bright Ceres Lockes bee neuer shorne Hee shall be sure this Yeere to lacke no Corne. [lxvi] Love naked. And would yee (Louers) know Why Loue doth naked goe? Fond, waggish, changeling Lad, Late whilst Thaumantias Voyce Hee wondring heard, it made him so rejoyce, That hee o'rejoy'd ran Mad: And in a franticke Fit threw Cloathes away, And since from Lip, and Lap hers can not straye. [lxvii] Niobe. Wretched Niobè I am, Let Wretches reade my Case, Not such who with a Teare ne're wet their Face; Seuen Daughters of mee came, And Sonnes as many, which one fatall Day (Orb'd Mother!) tooke away: Thus reft by Heauens vnjust, Griefe turn'd mee Stone, Stone too mee doth entombe, Which if thou dost mistrust, Of this hard Rocke but ope the flintie Wombe, And heere thou shalt finde Marble, and no Dust. [lxviii] Change of Loue. Once did I weepe, and grone, Drinke Teares, draw loathed Breath, And all for Loue of one Who did affect my Death: But now (Thankes to Disdaine) I liue relieu'd of Paine, For Sighs, I singing goe, I burne not as before, no, no, no, no. [lxix] Wilde Beautie. If all but Yce thou bee, How dost thou thus mee burne? Or how at Fire which thou dost raise in mee (Sith Yce) thy selfe in Streames dost thou not turne? But rather (plaintfull Case!) Of Yce art Marble made to my Disgrace: O Miracle of Loue! not heard till now, Cold Yce doth burne, and hard by Fire doth grow. [lxx] Constant Loue. Time makes great States decay, Time doth Mayes Pompe disgrace, Time drawes deepe Furrowes in the fairest Face, Time Wisdome, Force, Renowne, doth take away, Time doth consume the Yeeres, Time Changes workes in Heauens eternall Spheares: Yet this fierce Tyrant which doth all deuoure, To lessen Loue in mee shall haue no Power. [lxxi] To Chloris. See Chloris, how the Cloudes Tilte in the azure Lists, And how with Stygian Mists Each horned Hill his giant Forehead shroudes, Ioue thundreth in the Aire, The Aire growne great with Raine, Now seemes to bring Deucalions Dayes againe: I see thee quake, come, let vs home repaire, Come hide thee in mine Armes, If not for Loue, yet to shunne greater Harmes. [lxxii] VPON A POVRTRAIT. The Goddesse that in Amathus doth raigne, With siluer Tramells, and Saphire-colour'd Eyes, When naked from her Mothers christall Plaine Shee first appear'd vnto the wondring Skies; Or when (the golden Apple to obtaine) Her blushing Snowes amazed Idas Trees, Did neuer looke in halfe so faire a Guise As shee heere drawne, all other Ages Staine. O God what Beauties! to inflame the Soule, And hold the wildest Hearts in Chaines of Gold, Faire Lockes, sweet Face, Loues stately Capitole, Deare Necke, which dost that heauenly Frame vp-hold: If Vertue would to mortall Eyes appeare, To rauish Sense, shee would your Beautie weare. [lxxiii] Vpon that same [Portrait]. If Heauen, the Starres, and Nature, did her grace With all Perfections found the Moone aboue, And what excelleth in this lower Place, Did place in her, to breede a World of Loue? If Angells Gleames shine on her fairest Face? Which make Heauens Ioy on Earth the Gazer proue? And her bright Eyes (the Orbs which Beautie moue) Doe glance like Phœbus in his glorious Race? What Pincell paint? what Colour to the Sight So sweet a Shape can show? the blushing Morne The Red must lend, the milkie-Way the White, And Night the Starres, which her rich Crowne adorne, To draw her right: But then that all agree, The Heauen, the Table, Zeuxis Ioue must bee. [lxxiv] Vpon that same [Portrait], drawne with a Pansie. When with braue Arte the curious Painter drew This heauenly Shape, the Hand why made hee beare With golden Veines that Flowre of purple Hue, Which followes on the Planet of the Yeare? Was it to show how in our Hemispheare Like him shee shines? Nay, that Effects more true Of Power, and Wonder doe in her appeare, Whilst hee but Flowres, shee doth braue Minds subdue? Or would hee else to Vertues glorious Light Her constant Course make knowne? or is it hee Doth paralell her Blisse with Clytias Plight? Right so, and thus, hee reading in her Eye Some woefull Louers End, to grace his Graue, For Cypresse Tree this mourning Flowre her gaue. [lxxv] Vpon that same [Portrait]. If Sight bee not beguilde? And Eyes right playe their Part? This Flowre is not of Arte, But is faire Natures Child: And though when Phœbus from vs is exilde, Shee doth not locke her Leaues, his Losse to mone, No Wonder, Earth hath now moe Sunnes than one. [lxxvi] Thirsis in Dispraise of Beautie. That which so much the doating World doth prise, Fond Ladies only Care, and sole Delight, Soone-fading Beautie, which of Hues doth rise, Is but an abject Let of Natures Might; Most woefull Wretch, whom shining Haire and Eyes, Leade to Loues Dungeon, traitor'd by a Sight, Most woefull: for hee might with greater Ease Hells Portalls enter, and pale Death appease. As in delicious Meads beneath the Flowres, And the most wholsome Herbes that May can show, In christall Curles the speckled Serpent lowres, As in the Apple (which most faire doth grow) The rotten Worme is clos'd, which it deuoures, As in gilt Cups with Gnossian Wine which flow, Oft Poyson pompously doth hide its Sowres: So Lewdnesse, Falshood, Mischiefe, them aduance, Clad with the pleasant Rayes of Beauties Glance. Good thence is chas'd, where Beautie doth appeare, Milde Lowlinesse with Pittie from it flie, Where Beautie raignes as in their proper Spheare, Ingratitude, Disdaine, Pride, all descrie, The Flowre, and Fruit which Vertues Tree should beare, With her bad Shadowe Beautie maketh die: Beautie a Monster is, a Monster hurld From angrie Heauen, to scourge this lower World. As Fruits which are vnripe, and sowre of Taste, To bee confect'd more fit than sweet wee proue, For Sweet in Spight of Care themselues will waste, When they long kept, the Appetite doe moue: So in the Sweetnesse of his Nectare, Loue The foule confects, and seasons for his Feaste: Sowre is farre better which wee sweet may make, Than sweet which sweeter Sweetnesse will not take. Foule may my Ladie bee, and may her Nose (A Tanarife) giue Vmbrage to her Chinne; May her gay Mouth (which shee no Time may close) So wide be, that the Moone may turne therein, May Eyes, and Teeth, bee made conforme to those, Eyes set by Chance, and white, Teeth blacke and thinne: May all what seene is, and is hidde from Sight, Like vnto these rare Parts bee framed right. I shall not feare thus though shee straye alone, That others Her pursue, entice, admire, And though shee sometime counterfaite a Grone, I shall not thinke her Heart feeles vncouth Fire, I shall not stile Her ruethlesse to my Mone, Nor prowde, disdainfull, wayward to Desire: Her Thoughts with mine will hold an equall Line, I shall bee hers, and shee shall all bee mine. [lxxvii] Evrymedons Praise of Mira. Gemme of the Mountaines, Glorie of our Plaines, Rare Miracle of Nature, and of Loue, Sweet Atlas, who all Beauties Heauens sustaines, No, Beauties Heauen, where all her Wonders moue, The Sunne from East to West who all doth see, On this low Globe sees nothing like to thee. One Phœnix only liu'd ere thou wast borne, And Earth but did one Queene of Loue admire, Three Graces only did the World adorne, But thrise three Muses sung to Phœbus Lyre, Two Phœnixes bee now, Loues Queenes are two, Foure Graces, Muses ten, all made by you. For those Perfections which the bounteous Heauen To diuerse Worlds in diuerse Times assign'd, With thousands more, to thee at once were giuen, Thy Body faire, more faire they made thy Mind: And that thy like no Age should more behold, When thou wast fram'd they after brake the Mold. Sweet are the Blushes, on thy Face which shine, Sweet are the Flames, which sparkle from thine Eyes, Sweet are his Torments, who for thee doth pine, Most sweet his Death, for thee who sweetly dies, For if hee die, hee dies not by Annoy, But too much Sweetnesse and aboundant Ioy. What are my slender Layes to show thy Worth? How can base Words a thing so high make knowne? So wooden Globes bright Starres to vs set forth; So in a Christall is Sunnes Beautie showne: More of thy Praises if my Muse should write, More Loue and Pittie, must the same indite? [lxxviii] Thavmantia at the departure of Idmon. Faire Diane, from the Hight Of Heauens first Orbe who chear'st this lower Place, Hide now from mee thy Light, And pittying my Case, Spread with a Skarfe of Clouds thy blushing Face. Come with your dolefull Songs, Nights sable Birds, which plaine when others sleepe, Come, solemnize my Wrongs, And Consort to mee keepe, Sith Heauen, Earth, Hell, are set to cause mee weepe. This Griefe yet I could beare, If now by Absence I were only pinde, But ah! worse Euill I feare, Men absent proue vnkinde, And change (vnconstant like the Moone) their Minde. If Thought had so much Power Of thy Departure, that it could mee slaye? How will that vgly Houre My feeble Sense dismaye? Farewell sweet Heart, when I shall heare thee say. Deare Life, sith thou must goe, Take all my Ioy and Comfort hence with thee, And leaue with mee thy Woe, Which vntill I thee see, Nor Time, nor Place, nor Change shall take from mee. [lxxix] Erycine at the departure of Alexis. And wilt thou then, Alexis mine, depart? And leaue these flowrie Meads, and christall Streames? These Hills as greene as great with Gold and Gemmes, Which courte thee with rich Treasure in each Part? Shall nothing hold thee? not my loyall Heart, That burstes to lose the Comfort of thy Beames? Nor yet this Pipe which wildest Satyres tames? Nor Lambkins Wayling? nor old Dorus Smart? O ruethlesse Shepheard, Forrests strange among What canst thou else but fearfull Dangers finde? But ah! not thou, but Honour doth mee Wrong; O cruell Honour! Tyrant of the Mind, This said sad Erycine, and all the Flowres Empearled as shee went, with Eyes salt Showres. [lxxx] Alexis to Damon. The Loue Alexis did to Damon beare, Shall witness'd bee to all the Woods, and Plaines, As singulare, renown'd by neighbouring Swaines, That to our Relicts Time may Trophees reare: Those Madrigals wee sung amidst our Flockes, With Garlands guarded from Apollos Beames, On Ochells whiles, whiles neare Bodotrias Streames, Are registrate by Ecchoes in the Rockes. Of forraine Shepheards bent to trie the States, Though I (Worlds Guest) a Vagabond doe straye, Thou mayst that Store, which I esteeme Suruaye, As best acquainted with my Soules Conceits: What euer Fate Heauens haue for mee design'd, I trust thee with the Treasure of my Mind. FINIS. Forth Feasting To his sacred Majestie. If, in this Storme of joy and pompous Throng, This Nymphe (great King) come euer Thee so neare That Thy harmonious Eares Her Accents heare, Giue Pardon to Her hoarse and lowlie Song: Faine would Shee Trophees to Thy Vertues reare, But for this statlie Task Shee is not Strong, And Her Defects Her high Attempts doe wrong, Yet as Shee could shee makes Thy Worth appeare. So in a Mappe is showen this flowrie Place; So wrought in Arras by a Virgines Hand With Heauen and blazing Starres doth Atlas stand, So drawen by Chare-coale is Narcissus Face: Shee maye Aurora be to some bright Sunne Which maye perfect the Day by her begunne. FORTH FEASTING. A PANEGYRICKE To the Kings most excellent Majesty. What blustring Noise now interrupts my Sleepe? What echoing Shouts thus cleaue my chrystal Deep? And call mee hence from out my watrie Court? What Melodie, what Sounds of Ioy and Sport, Bee these heere hurl'd from eu'rie neighbour Spring? With what lowd Rumours doe the Mountaines ring? Which in vnusuall Pompe on tip-toes stand, And (full of Wonder) ouer-looke the Land? Whence come these glittring Throngs, these Meteors bright, This golden People set vnto my Sight? Whence doth this Praise, Applause, and Loue, arise? What Load-starre east-ward draweth thus all Eyes? Am I awake? or haue some Dreames conspir'd To mocke my Sense with Shadowes much desir'd? Stare I that liuing Face, see I those Lookes, Which with Delight wont to amaze my Brookes? Doe I behold that Worth, that Man diuine, This Ages Glorie, by these Bankes of mine? Then is it true what long I wish'd in vaine? That my much-louing Prince is come againe? So vnto Them whose Zenith is the Pole When sixe blacke Months are past the Sunne doeth rolle: So after Tempest to Sea-tossed Wights Faire Helens Brothers show their chearing Lights: So comes Arabias Meruaile from her Woods, And farre farre off is seene by Memphis Floods, The feather'd Syluans Clowd-like by her flie, And with applauding Clangors beate the Skie, Nyle wonders, Seraps Priests (entranced) raue, And in Mygdonian Stone her Shape ingraue; In lasting Cedars marke the joyfull Time In which Apollos Bird came to their Clime. Let Mother Earth now deckt with Flowres bee seene, And sweet-breath'd Zephyres curle the Medowes greene: Let Heauens weepe Rubies in a crimsin Showre, Such as on Indies Shores they vse to powre: Or with that golden Storme the Fields adorne, Which Ioue rain'd, when his Blew-eyed Maide was borne. May neuer Houres the Webbe of Day out-weaue, May neuer Night rise from her sable Caue. Swell prowd my Billowes, faint not to declare Your Ioyes, as ample as their Causes are: For Murmures hoarse sound like Arions Harpe, Now delicatlie flat, now sweetlie sharpe. And you my Nymphes, rise from your moyst Repaire, Strow all your Springs and Grotts with Lillies faire: Some swiftest-footted get her hence and pray Our Floods and Lakes, come keepe this Holie-day; What e're beneath Albanias Hills doe runne, Which see the rising or the setting Sunne, Which drinke sterne Grampius Mists, or Ochells Snows: Stone-rowling Taye, Tine Tortoyse-like that flows, The pearlie Don, the Deas, the fertile Spay, Wild Neuerne which doth see our longest Day, Nesse smoaking-Sulphure, Leaue with Mountaines crown'd, Strange Loumond for his floting Isles renown'd: The irish Rian, Ken, the siluer Aire, The snakie Dun, the Ore with rushie Haire, The Chrystall-streaming Nid, lowd-bellowing Clyd, Tweed which no more our Kingdomes shall deuide: Rancke-swelling Annan, Lid with curled Streames, The Eskes, the Solway where they loòse their Names, To eu'rie one proclaime our Ioyes, and Feasts, Our Triumphes; bid all come, and bee our Guests: And as they meet in Neptunes azure Hall, Bid Them bid Sea-Gods keepe this Festiuall. This Day shall by our Currents bee renown'd, Our Hills about shall still this Day resound: Nay, that our Loue more to this Day appeare, Let vs with it hence foorth begin our Yeare. To Virgins Flowres, to Sunne-burnt Earth the Raine, To Mariners faire Winds amidst the Maine: Coole Shades to Pilgrimes, which hote Glances burne, Please not so much, to vs as Thy Returne. That Day (deare Prince) which reft vs of thy Sight, [Day, no, but Darknesse, and a duskie Night] Did fraight our Brests with Sighs, our Eyes with Teares, Turn'd Minutes in sad Months, sad Months in Yeares: Trees left to flowrish, Medowes to beare Flowres, Brookes hid their Heads within their sedgie Bowres, Faire Ceres curst our Fields with barren Frost, As if againe shee had her Daughter lost: The Muses left our Groues, and for sweete Songs Sate sadlie silent, or did weepe their Wrongs; Yee know it Meads, yee murmuring Woods it know, Hilles, Dales, and Caues, Copartners of their Woe; And yee it know my Streames, which from their Eine Oft on your Glasse recieu'd their pearled Brine; O Naïds deare (said They) Nap?as faire, O Nymphes of Trees, Nymphes which on Hills repaire, Gone are those maiden Glories, gone that State, Which made all Eyes admire our Hap of late. As lookes the Heauen when neuer Starre appeares, But slow and wearie shroude them in their Spheares, While Tithons wife embosom'd by Him lies, And World doth languish in a drearie Guise: As lookes a Garden of its Beautie spoil'd, As Wood in Winter by rough Boreas foil'd; As Pourtraicts raz'd of Colours vse to bee: So lookt these abject Bounds depriu'd of Thee. While as my Rills enjoy'd Thy royall Gleames, They did not enuie Tibers haughtie Streames, Nor wealthie Tagus with his golden Ore, Nor cleare Hydaspes which on Pearles doth rore, Empampred Gange that sees the Sunne new borne, Nor Acheloüs with his flowrie Horne, Nor Floods which neare Elysian Fields doe fall: For why? Thy Sight did serue to them for all. No Place there is so desart, so alone, Euen from the frozen to the torrid Zone, From flaming Hecla to great Quincys Lake, Which Thine abode could not most happie make. All those Perfections which by bounteous Heauen To diuerse Worlds in diuerse Times were giuen, The starrie Senate powr'd at once on Thee, That Thou Examplare mightst to Others bee. Thy Life was kept till the three Sisters spunne Their Threedes of Gold, and then it was begunne. With curled Clowds when Skies doe looke most faire, And no disordred Blasts disturbe the Aire, When Lillies doe them decke in azure Gownes; And new-borne Roses blush with golden Crownes; To bode, how calme wee vnder Thee should liue, What Halcyonean Dayes Thy Reigne should giue, And to two flowrie Diademes Thy right; The Heauens Thee made a Partner of the Light. Scarce wast Thou borne, when joyn'd in friendly Bands Two mortall Foes with other clasped Hands, With Vertue Fortune stroue, which most should grace Thy Place for Thee, Thee for so high a Place, One vow'd thy sacred Brest not to forsake, The Other on Thee not to turne her Backe, And that Thou more her loues Effects mightst feele For Thee shee rent her Sayle, and broke her Wheele. When Yeeres Thee vigour gaue, O then how cleare Did smoothred Sparkles in bright Flames appeare? Amongst the Woods to force a flying Hart, To pearce the mountaine-Wolfe with feathred Dart, See Faulcons climbe the Clowds, the Foxe ensnare, Out-runne the winde-out-running dædale Hare, To loose a trampling Steede alongst a Plaine, And in meandring Gyres him bring againe, The Preasse Thee making place, were vulgare Things; In Admirations Aire on Glories Wings O! Thou farre from the common Pitch didst rise, With Thy designes to dazell Enuies Eyes: Thou soughtst to know, this Alls eternall Source, Of euer-turning Heauens the restlesse Course, Their fixed Eyes, their Lights which wandring runne, Whence Moone her Siluer hath, his Gold the Sunne, If Destine bee or no, if Planets can By fierce Aspects force the Free-will of Man: The light and spiring Fire, the liquid Aire, The flaming Dragons, Comets with red Haire, Heauens tilting Launces, Artillerie, and Bow, Lowd-sounding Trumpets, Darts of Haile and Snow, The roaring Element with People dombe, The Earth with what conceiu'd is in her Wombe, What on Her moues, were set vnto Thy Sight, Till Thou didst find their Causes, Essence, Might: But vnto nought Thou so Thy Mind didst straine As to bee read in Man, and learne to raigne; To know the Weight, and Atlas of a Crowne, To spare the Humble, Prowdlings pester downe. When from those pearcing Cares which Thrones inuest, As Thornes the Rose, Thou weari'd wouldst Thee rest, With Lute in Hand, full of cœlestiall Fire, To the Pierian Groues Thou didst retire: There, garlanded with all Vranias Flowres, In sweeter Layes than builded Thebees Towres, Or them which charm'd the Dolphines in the Maine, Or which did call Euridicè againe, Thou sungst away the Houres, till from their Spheare Starres seem'd to shoote, Thy Melodie to heare. The God with golden Haire, the Sister Maides, Left, nymphall Helicon, their Tempès Shades, To see Thine Isle, heere lost their natiue Tongue, And in Thy world-diuided Language sung. Who of Thine After-age can count the Deedes, With all that Fame in Times hudge Annales reedes, How by Example more than anie Law, This People fierce Thou didst to Goodnesse draw; How while the Neighbour Worlds (tows'd by the Fates) So manie Phaëtons had in their States, Which turn'd in heedlesse Flames their burnish'd Thrones, Thou (as ensphear'd) kepdst temperate Thy Zones; In Africke Shores the Sands that ebbe and flow, The shadie Leaues on Ardennes Trees that grow, Hee sure may count, with all the Waues that meet To wash the Mauritanian Atlas feet. Though crown'd thou wert not, nor a King by Birth, Thy Worth deserues the richest Crowne on Earth. Search this Halfe Spheare and the opposite Ground, Where is such Wit and Bountie to bee found? As into silent Night, when neare the Beare The Virgine Huntresse shines at full most cleare, And striues to match her Brothers golden Light, The Hoast of Starres doth vanish in her Sight, Arcturus dies, cool'd is the Lyons ire, Po burnes no more with Phaëtontall Fire, Orion faints to see his Armes grow blacke, And that his flamming Sword hee now doth lacke: So Europes Lights, all bright in their Degree, Loose all their Lustre paragond with Thee. By just Discent Thou from moe Kings dost shine, Then manie can name Men in all their Line: What most They toyle to find, and finding hold Thou skornest, orient Gemmes, and flattring Gold: Esteeming Treasure surer in Mens Brests, Than when immur'd with Marble, closd in Chests; No stormie Passions doe disturbe thy Mind, No Mists of greatnesse euer could Thee blind: Who yet hath beene so meeke? Thou life didst giue To Them who did repine to see Thee liue; What Prince by Goodnesse hath such Kingdomes gain'd? Who hath so long his Peoples Peace maintain'd? Their Swords are turn'd in Sythes, in Culters Speares, Some giant Post their anticke Armour beares: Now, where the wounded Knight his Life did bleed, The wanton Swaine sits piping on a Reed. And where the Canon did Ioues Thunder skorne, The gawdie Hunts-man windes his shrill-tun'd Horne: Her greene Lockes Ceres void of feare doth die, The Pilgrime safelie in the Shade doth lie, Both Pan and Pales (carelesse) keepe their Flockes, Seas haue no Dangers saue the Winds and Rockes: Thou art this Isles Palladium, neither can [While Thou art kept] it bee o're-throwne by Man. Let Others boast of Blood and Spoyles of Foes, Fierce Rapines, Murders, Iliads of Woes, Of hated Pompe, and Trophæes reared faire, Gore-spangled Ensignes streaming in the Aire, Count how They make The Scythian them adore, The Gaditan the Souldiour of Aurore, Unhappie Vauntrie! to enlarge their Bounds, Which charge themselues with Cares, their Friends with Wounds, Which haue no Law to their ambitious Will, But (Man-plagues) borne are humane Blood to spill: Thou a true Victor art, sent from aboue What Others straine by Force to gaine by Loue, World-wandring Fame this Prayse to Thee imparts, To bee the onlie Monarch of all Hearts. They many feare who are of many fear'd, And Kingdomes got by Wrongs by Wrongs are tear'd, Such Thrones as Blood doth raise Blood throweth downe, No Guard so sure as Loue vnto a Crowne. Eye of our westerne World, Mars-daunting King, With whose Renowne the Earths seuen Climats ring, Thy Deedes not only claime these Diademes, To which Thame, Liffy, Taye, subject their Streames: But to thy Vertues rare, and Gifts, is due, All that the Planet of the Yeere doth view; Sure if the World aboue did want a Prince, The World aboue to it would take thee hence. That Murder, Rapine, Lust, are fled to Hell, And in their Roomes with vs the Graces dwell, That Honour more than Riches Men respect, That Worthinesse than Gold doth more effect, That Pietie vnmasked showes her Face, That Innocencie keepes with Power her Place, That long-exil'd Astrea leaues the Heauen, And turneth right her Sword, her Weights holds euen, That the Saturnian World is come againe, Are wish'd Effects of Thy most happie Raigne. That dayly Peace, Loue, Trueth, Delights encrease, And Discord, Hate, Fraude, with Incombers cease, That Men vse Strength not to shed others Blood, But vse their Strength now to doe other Good, That Furie is enchain'd, disarmed Wrath, That (saue by Natures Hand) there is no Death, That late grimme Foes like Brothers other loue, That Vultures prey not on the harmlesse Doue, That Wolues with Lambs doe Friendship entertaine, Are wish'd Effects of thy most happie Raigne. That Towns encrease, That ruin'd Temples rise, And their wind-mouing Vanes plant in the Skies, That Ignorance and Sloth hence runne away, That buri'd Arts now rowse them to the Day, That Hyperiòn farre beyond his Bed Doth see, our Lyons rampe, our Roses spred, That Iber courtes vs, Tyber not vs charmes; That Rhein with hence-brought Beams his Bosome warmes, That Euill vs feare, and Good vs doe maintaine, Are wish'd Effects of Thy most happie Raigne. O Vertues Patterne, Glorie of our Times, Sent of past Dayes to expiate the Crimes, Great King, but better farre than thou art greate, Whome State not honours, but who honours State, By Wonder borne, by Wonder first enstall'd, By Wonder after to new Kingdomes call'd, Young kept by Wonder neare home-bred Alarmes, Old sau'd by Wonder from pale Traitours Harmes, To bee for this Thy Raigne which Wonders brings, A King of Wonder, Wonder vnto Kings. If Pict, Dane, Norman, Thy smooth Yoke had seene, Pict, Dane, and Norman, had thy Subjects beene: If Brutus knew the Blisse Thy Rule doth giue, Euen Brutus joye would vnder Thee to liue: For Thou Thy People dost so dearlie loue, That they a Father, more than Prince, Thee proue. O Dayes to bee desyr'd! Age happie thrice! If yee your Heauen-sent-Good could duelie prize, But yee (halfe-palsie-sicke) thinke neuer right Of what yee hold, till it bee from your Sight, Prize onlie Summers sweet and musked Breath, When armed Winters threaten you with Death, In pallid Sicknesse doe esteeme of Health, And by sad Pouertie discerne of Wealth: I see ane Age when after manie Yeares, And Reuolutions of the slow-pac'd Spheares, These Dayes shall bee to other farre esteem'd, And like Augustus palmie Raigne bee deem'd. The Names, of Arthure fabulous Palladines, Grau'n in Times surlie Brows in wrinckled Lines, Of Henries, Edwards, famous for their Fights, Their Neighbour Conquests, Orders new of Knights, Shall by this Princes Name be past as farre As Meteors are by the Idalian Starre. If Gray-hair'd Proteüs Songs the Truth not misse, And Gray-hair'd Proteüs oft a Prophet is, There is a Land hence-distant manie Miles, Out-reaching Fiction and Atlanticke Iles, Which (Homelings) from this litle World wee name, That shall imblazon with strange Rites his Fame, Shall, reare him Statues all of purest Gold, Such as Men gaue vnto the Gods of old, Name by him Fanes, prowd Pallaces, and Towns, With some great Flood, which most their Fields renowns. This is that King who should make right each Wrong, Of whome the Bards and mysticke Sybilles song, The Man long promis'd, by whose glorious Raigne, This Isle should yet her ancient Name regaine, And more of Fortunate deserue the Stile, Than those where Heauens with double Summers smile. Runne on (great Prince) Thy Course in Glories Way, The End the Life, the Euening crownes the Day; Heape Worth on Worth, and stronglie soare aboue Those Heights which made the World Thee first to loue, Surmount Thy Selfe, and make thine Actions past Bee but as Gleames or Lightnings of Thy last, Let them exceed them of Thy younger Time, As farre as Autumne doth the flowrie Prime. Through this Thy Empire range, like Worlds bright Eye, That once each Yeare suruayes all Earth and Skie, Now glaunces on the slow and restie Beares, Then turnes to drie the weeping Austers Teares, Iust vnto both the Poles, and moueth euen In the infigur'd Circle of the Heauen. O long long haunt these Bounds, which by Thy Sight Haue now regain'd their former Heate and Light. Heere grow greene Woods, heere siluer Brookes doe glide, Heere Meadowes stretch them out with painted Pride, Embrodring all the Banks, heere Hilles aspire To crowne their Heads with the ætheriall Fire: Hills, Bullwarks of our Freedome, giant Walls, Which neuer Fremdlings Slight nor Sword made Thralls; Each circling Flood to Thetis Tribute payes, Men heere (in Health) out-liue old Nestors Dayes: Grimme Saturne yet amongst our Rocks remaines, Bound in our Caues, with many Mettald Chaines: Bulls haunt our Shades like Ledas Louer white, Which yet might breede Pasiphaè Delight, Our Flocks faire Fleeces beare, with which for Sport Endemion of old the Moone did court, High-palmed Harts amidst our Forrests runne, And, not impall'd, the deepe-mouth'd Hounds doe shunne; The rough-foote Hare him in our Bushes shrowds, And long-wing'd Haulks doe pearch amidst our Clowds. The wanton wood-Nymphes of the verdant Spring, Blew, Golden, Purple, Flowres shall to Thee bring, Pomonas Fruits the Paniskes, Thetis Gyrles Thy Thulys Amber, with the Ocean Pearles; The Tritons, Heards-men of the glassie Field, Shall giue Thee what farre-distant Shores can yeeld, The Serean Fleeces, Erythrean Gemmes, Vaste Platas Siluer, Gold of Peru Streames, Antarticke Parrots, Æthiopian Plumes, Sabæan Odours, Myrrhe, and sweet Perfumes: And I my selfe, wrapt in a watchet Gowne, Of Reedes and Lillies on mine Head a Crowne, Shall Incense to Thee burne, greene Altars raise, And yearly sing due Pæans to Thy Praise. Ah why should Isis only see Thee shine? Is not thy Forth, as well as Isis Thine? Though Isis vaunt shee hath more Wealth in store, Let it suffice Thy Forth doth loue Thee more: Though Shee for Beautie may compare with Seine, For Swannes and Sea-Nymphes with imperiall Rhene, Yet in the Title may bee claim'd in Thee, Nor Shee, nor all the World, can match with mee. Now when (by Honour drawne) thou shalt away To Her alreadie jelous of thy Stay, When in Her amourous Armes Shee doth Thee fold, And dries thy Dewie Haires with Hers of Gold, Much questioning of Thy Fare, much of Thy Sport, Much of Thine Absence, Long, how e're so short, And chides (perhaps) Thy Comming to the North, Loathe not to thinke on Thy much-louing Forth: O loue these Bounds, whereof Thy royall Stemme More then an hundreth wore a Diademe. So euer Gold and Bayes Thy Browes adorne, So neuer Time may see Thy Race out-worne, So of Thine Owne still mayst Thou bee desir'd, Of Strangers fear'd, redoubted, and admir'd; So Memorie the Praise, so precious Houres May character Thy Name in starrie Flowres; So may Thy high Exployts at last make euen, With Earth thy Empyre, Glorie with the Heauen.

      <field name="fulltext">Volume the Second FLOWRES OF SION: BY W. D. OR SPIRITVALL POEMES, [i] [The Instabilitie of Mortall Glorie.] Triumphant Arches, Statues crown'd with Bayes, Proude Obeliskes, Tombes of the vastest frame, Colosses, brasen Atlases of Fame, Phanes vainelie builded to vaine Idoles praise; States, which vnsatiate Mindes in blood doe raise, From the Crosse-starres vnto the Articke Teame, Alas! and what wee write to keepe our Name, Like Spiders Caules are made the sport of Dayes: All onely constant is in constant Change, What done is, is vndone, and when vndone, Into some other figure doeth it range; Thus moues the restlesse World beneath the Moone: Wherefore (my Minde) aboue Time, Motion, Place, Thee raise, and Steppes, not reach'd by Nature trace. [ii] [Humane Frailtie.] A Good that neuer satisfies the Minde, A Beautie fading like the Aprile flowres, A Sweete with floodes of Gall that runnes combind, A Pleasure passing ere in thought made ours, A Honour that more fickle is than winde, A Glorie at Opinions frowne that lowres, A Treasurie which Bankrout Time deuoures, A Knowledge than graue Ignorance more blind: A vaine Delight our equalles to command, A Stile of greatnesse, in effect a Dreame, A fabulous Thought of holding Sea and Land, A seruile Lot, deckt with a pompous Name, Are the strange endes wee toyle for heere below, Till wisest Death make vs our errores know. [i] [The Permanencie of Life.] Life a right shadow is, For if it long appeare, Then is it spent, and Deathes long Night drawes neare; Shadowes are mouing, light, And is there ought so mouing as is this? When it is most in Sight, It steales away, and none can tell how, where, So neere our Cradles to our Coffines are. [iii] [No Trust in Tyme.] Looke how the Flowre, which lingringlie doth fade, The Mornings Darling late, the Summers Queene, Spoyl'd of that Iuice, which kept it fresh and greene, As high as it did raise, bowes low the head: Right so my Life. (Contentments beeing dead, Or in their Contraries but onelie seene) With swifter speede declines than earst it spred, And (blasted) scarce now showes what it hath beene. As doth the Pilgrime therefore whom the Night By darknesse would imprison on his way, Thinke on thy Home (my Soule) and thinke aright, Of what yet restes thee of Lifes wasting Day: Thy Sunne postes Westward, passed is thy Morne, And twice it is not giuen thee to bee borne. [iv] [Worldes Ioyes are Toyes.] The wearie Mariner so fast not flies An howling Tempest, Harbour to attaine, Nor Sheepheard hastes, when frayes of Wolues arise, So fast to Fold to saue his bleeting Traine: As I (wing'd with Contempt and just Disdaine) Now flie the World, and what it most doth prize, And Sanctuarie seeke, free to remaine From wounds of abject Times, and Enuies eyes. Once did this World to mee seeme sweete and faire, While Senses light Mindes prospectiue keept blind, Now like imagin'd Landskip in the Aire, And weeping Raine-bowes, her best Ioyes I finde: Or if ought heere is had that praise should haue, It is a Life obscure, and silent Graue. [v] [Nature must yeelde to Grace.] Too long I followed haue on fond Desire, And too long painted on deluding Streames, Too long refreshment sought in burning Fire, Runne after Ioyes which to my Soule were Blames; Ah! when I had what most I did admire, And prou'd of Lifes delightes the last extreames, I found all but a Rose hedg'd with a Bryer, A nought, a thought, a show of golden Dreames. Hence-foorth on Thee (mine onelie Good) I thinke, For onelie Thou canst grant what I doe craue, Thy Nailes my Pennes shall bee, thy Blood mine Inke, Thy winding-sheete my Paper, Studie Graue: And till that Soule from Bodie parted bee, No hope I haue, but onelie onelie Thee. [vi] [The Booke of the World.] Of this faire Volumne which wee World doe name, If wee the sheetes and leaues could turne with care, Of Him who it correctes, and did it frame, Wee cleare might read the Art and Wisedome rare? Finde out his Power which wildest Pow'rs doth tame, His Prouidence extending euerie-where, His Iustice which proud Rebels doeth not spare, In euerie Page, no, Period of the same: But sillie wee (like foolish Children) rest Well pleas'd with colour'd Velame, Leaues of Gold, Faire dangling Ribbones, leauing what is best, On the great Writers sense nee'r taking hold; Or if by chance our Mindes doe muse on ought, It is some Picture on the Margine wrought. [vii] [The Miserable Estate of the World before the Incarnation of God.] The Griefe was common, common were the Cryes, Teares, Sobbes, and Groanes of that afflicted Traine, Which of Gods chosen did the Summe containe, And Earth rebounded with them, pierc'd were Skies; All good had left the World, each Vice did raigne, In the most hideous shapes Hell could deuise, And all degrees, and each Estate did staine, Nor further had to goe, whom to surprise: The World beneath the Prince of Darknesse lay, In euerie Phane who had himselfe install'd, Was sacrifiz'd vnto, by Prayers call'd, Responses gaue, which (Fooles) they did obey: When (pittying Man) God of a Virgines wombe Was borne, and those false Deities strooke dombe. [viii] [The Angels for the Natiuitie of our Lord.] Rvnne (Sheepheards) run where Bethleme blest appeares, Wee bring the best of newes, bee not dismay'd, A Sauiour there is borne, more olde than yeares, Amidst Heauens rolling hights this Earth who stay'd; In a poore Cotage Inn'd, a Virgine Maide A weakling did him beare, who all vpbeares, There is hee poorelie swadl'd, in Manger lai'd, To whom too narrow Swadlings are our Spheares: Runne (Sheepheards) runne, and solemnize his Birth, This is that Night, no, Day growne great with Blisse, In which the power of Sathan broken is, In Heauen bee glorie, Peace vnto the Earth. Thus singing through the Aire the Angels swame, And Cope of Starres re-echoed the same. [ix] [For the Natiuitie of our Lord.] O than the fairest Day, thrice fairer Night! Night to best Dayes in which a Sunne doth rise, Of which that golden Eye, which cleares the Skies, Is but a sparkling Ray, a Shadow light: And blessed yee (in sillie Pastors sight) Milde Creatures, in whose warme Cribe now lyes That Heauen-sent Yongling, holie-Maide-borne Wight, Midst, end, beginning of our Prophesies: Blest Cotage that hath Flowres in Winter spred, Though withered blessed Grasse, that hath the grace To decke, and bee a Carpet to that Place. Thus sang, vnto the Soundes of oaten Reed, Before the Babe, the Sheepheards bow'd on knees, And Springs ranne Nectar, Honey dropt from Trees. [x] [Amazement at the Incarnation of God.] To spread the azure Canopie of Heauen, And make it twinkle with those spangs of Gold, To stay this weightie masse of Earth so euen, That it should all, and nought should it vp-hold; To giue strange motions to the Planets seuen, Or Ioue to make so meeke, or Mars so bold, To temper what is moist, drie, hote, and cold, Of all their Iarres that sweete accords are giuen: Lord, to thy Wisedome nought is, nor thy Might; But that thou shouldst (thy Glorie laid aside) Come meanelie in mortalitie to bide, And die for those deseru'd eternall plight, A wonder is so farre aboue our wit, That Angels stand amaz'd to muse on it. [xi] [For the Baptiste.] The last and greatest Herauld of Heauens King, Girt with rough Skinnes, hyes to the Desarts wilde, Among that sauage brood the Woods foorth bring, Which hee than Man more harmlesse found and milde: His food was Blossomes, and what yong doth spring, With Honey that from virgine Hiues distil'd; Parcht Bodie, hollow Eyes, some vncouth thing Made him appeare, long since from Earth exilde. There burst hee foorth; All yee, whose Hopes relye On God, with mee amidst these Desarts mourne, Repent, repent, and from olde errours turne. Who listned to his voyce, obey'd his crye? Onelie the Ecchoes which hee made relent, Rung from their Marble Caues, repent, repent. [xii] [For the Magdalene.] These Eyes (deare Lord) once Brandons of Desire, Fraile Scoutes betraying what they had to keepe, Which their owne heart, then others set on fire, Their traitrous blacke before thee heere out-weepe: These Lockes, of blushing deedes the faire attire, Smooth-frizled Waues, sad Shelfes which shadow deepe, Soule-stinging Serpents in gilt curles which creepe, To touch thy sacred Feete doe now aspire. In Seas of Care behold a sinking Barke, By windes of sharpe Remorse vnto thee driuen, O let mee not expos'd be Ruines marke, My faults confest (Lord) say they are forgiuen. Thus sigh'd to Iesvs the Bethanian faire, His teare-wet Feete still drying with her Haire. [xiii] [For the Prodigall.] I countries chang'd, new pleasures out to finde, But Ah! for pleasure new I found new paine, Enchanting pleasure so did Reason blind, That Fathers loue, and wordes I scorn'd as vaine: For Tables rich, for bed, for frequent traine Of carefull seruants to obserue my Minde, These Heardes I keepe my fellowes are assign'd, My Bed a Rocke is, Hearbes my Life sustaine. Now while I famine feele, feare worser harmes, Father and Lord I turne, thy Loue (yet great) My faults will pardon, pitty mine estate. This, where an aged Oake had spread its Armes, Thought the lost Child, while as the Heardes hee led, Not farre off on the ackornes wilde them fed. [xiv] [For the Passion.] If that the World doth in a maze remaine, To heare in what a sad deploring mood, The Pelican powres from her brest her Blood, To bring to life her younglinges backe again? How should wee wonder of that soueraigne Good, Who from that Serpents sting (that had vs slaine) To saue our liues, shed his Lifes purple flood, And turn'd in endlesse Ioy our endlesse Paine? Vngratefull Soule, that charm'd with false Delight, Hast long long wandr'd in Sinnes flowrie Path, And didst not thinke at all, or thoughtst not right On this thy Pelicanes great Loue and Death, Heere pause, and let (though Earth it scorne) Heauen see Thee powre forth teares to him powr'd Blood for thee. [i] [An Hymne of the Passion.] If, when farre in the East yee doe behold Foorth from his Christall Bed the Sunne to rise, With rosie Robes and Crowne of flaming Gold? If gazing on that Empresse of the Skies, That takes so many Formes, and those faire Brands, Which blaze in Heauens high Vault, Nights watchfull eyes? If Seeing how the Seas tumultuous Bands Of bellowing Billowes haue their course confin'd, How vnsustain'd the Earth still steadfast stands: Poore mortall Wights, yee e're found in your Minde A thought, that some great King did sit aboue, Who had such Lawes and Rites to them assign'd; A King who fix'd the Poles made Spheares to moue, All Wisedome, purenesse, Excellence, and Might, All Goodnesse, Greatnesse, Iustice, Beauty, Loue? With feare and wonder hither turne your Sight, See, see (alas) Him now, not in that State Thought could fore-cast Him into Reasons light. Now Eyes with teares, now Hearts with griefe make great, Bemoane this cruell Death and dreary case, If euer plaints iust Woe could aggrauate? From Sinne and Hell to saue vs, humaine Race, See this great King naill'd to an abiect Tree, An obiect of reproach and sad disgrace. O vnheard Pitty, Loue in strange degree! Hee his owne Life doth giue, his Blood doth shed, For Wormelings base such Excellence to see. Poore Wightes, behold His Visage pale as Lead, His Head bow'd to His Brest, Lockes sadlie rent, Like a cropt Rose that languishing doth fade. Weake Nature weepe, astonish'd World lament, Lament, yee Windes, you Heauen that all containes, And thou (my Soule) let nought thy Griefe relent. Those Hands, those sacred Hands which hold the raines Of this great All, and kept from mutuall warres The Elements, beare rent for thee their Veines: Those feete which once must trade on golden Starres, For thee with nailes would bee pierc'd through and torne, For thee Heauens King from Heauen himselfe debarres. This great heart-quaking Dolour waile and mourne, Yee that long since Him saw by might of Faith, Yee now that are, and yee yet to bee borne. Not to behold his great Creators Death, The Sunne from sinfull eyes hath vail'd his light, And faintly iourneyes up Heauens saphire Path. And, cutting from her Browes her Tresses bright, The Moone doth keepe her Lords sad Obsequies, Impearling with her Teares this Robe of Night. All staggering and lazie lowre the Skies, The Earth and elemental Stages quake, The long since dead from bursted Graues arise. And can things wanting sense yet sorrow take, And beare a Part with him who all them wrought? And Man (though borne with cries) shall pitty lacke? Thinke what had beene your state, had hee not brought To these sharpe Pangs himselfe, and priz'd so hie Your Soules, that with his Life them life Hee bought. What Woes doe you attend, if still yee lie Plung'd in your wonted ordures, wretched Brood, Shall for your sake againe GOD euer die? O leaue deluding shewes, embrace true good, Hee on you calles, forgoe Sinnes shamefull trade, With Prayers now seeke Heauen, and not with Blood. Let not the Lambes more from their Dames bee had, Nor Altars blush for Sinne; liue euery thing, That long time long'd-for sacrifice is made. All that is from you crau'd by this great King Is to beleeue, a pure Heart Incense is, What gift (alas) can wee him meaner bring? Haste sinne-sicke Soules, this season doe not misse, Now while remorselesse time doth grant you space, And GOD inuites you to your only Blisse. Hee who you calles will not denie you Grace, But low-deepe burie faults, so yee repent, His armes (loe) stretched are you to embrace. When Dayes are done, and Lifes small sparke is spent, So yee accept what freely here is giuen, Like brood of Angels, deathlesse, all-content, Yee shall for euer liue with him in Heauen. [xv] [To the Angels for the Passion.] Come forth, come forth yee blest triumphing Bands, Faire Citizens of that immortall Towne, Come see that King which all this All commands, Now (ouercharg'd with Loue) die for his owne; Looke on those Nailes which pierce his Feete and Hands, What a sharpe Diademe his Browes doth crowne? Behold his pallid Face, his Eyes which sowne, And what a Throng of Theeues him mocking stands. Come forth yee empyrean Troupes, come forth, Preserue this sacred Blood that Earth adornes, Those liquid Roses gather off his Thornes, O! to bee lost they bee of too much worth: For streams, Iuice, Balm they are, which qu?ch, kils, charms Of God, Death, Hel, the wrath, the life, the harmes. [ii] [Faith aboue Reason.] Soule, which to Hell wast thrall, Hee, Hee for thine offence, Did suffer Death, who could not die at all. O soueraigne Excellence, O Life of all that liues, Eternall Bounty which each good thing giues, How could Death mount so hie? No wit this hight can reach, Faith only doth vs teach, For vs Hee died, at all who could not dye. [xvi] [Vpon the Sepulcher of our Lord.] Life to giue life depriued is of Life, And Death displai'd hath ensigne against Death; So violent the Rigour was of Death, That nought could daunt it but the Life of Life: No Power had Pow'r to thrall Lifes pow'r to Death, But willingly Life hath abandon'd Life, Loue gaue the wound which wrought this work of Death, His Bow and Shafts were of the Tree of Life. Now quakes the Author of eternall Death, To finde that they whom earst he reft of Life Shall fill his Roome aboue the listes of Death: Now all reioyce in Death who hope for Life. Dead Iesvs lies, who Death hath kill'd by Death, His Tombe no Tombe is, but new Source of Life. [ii] [An Hymne of the Resurrection.] Rise from those fragrant Climes thee now embrace, Vnto this world of ours O haste thy Race, Faire Sunne, and though contrary-wayes all yeare Thou hold thy course, now with the highest Spheare Ioyne thy swift Wheeles, to hasten time that lowres, And lazie Minutes turne in perfect Houres; The Night and Death too long a league haue made, To stow the world in Horrors vgly shade. Shake from thy Lockes a Day with saffron Rayes So faire, that it out shine all other dayes; And yet doe not presume (great Eye of light) To be that which this Day shall make so bright: See, an eternall Sunne hastes to arise, Not from the Easterne blushing Seas or Skies, Or any stranger Worlds Heauens Concaues haue, But from the Darknesse of an hollow Graue: And this is that all-powerfull Sunne aboue, That crownd thy Browes with Rayes, first made thee moue. Lights Trumpetters, yee neede not from your Bowres Proclaime this Day, this the angelike Powres Haue done for you; But now an opall hew Bepaintes Heauens Christall, to the longing view Earths late hid Colours glance, Light doth adorne The World, and (weeping Ioy) foorth comes the Morne; And with her, as from a Lethargicke Transe Breath (com'd againe) that Bodie doth aduance, Which two sad Nights in rocke lay coffin'd dead, And with an iron Guard inuironed, Life out of Death, Light out of Darknesse springs, From a base Iaile foorth comes the King of kings; What late was mortall, thrall'd to euery woe, That lackeyes life, or vpon sence doth grow, Immortall is, of an eternall Stampe, Farre brighter beaming than the morning Lampe. So from a blacke Ecclipse out-peeres the Sunne: Such [when a huge of Dayes haue on her runne, In a farre forest in the pearly East, And shee her selfe hath burnt and spicie Nest] The lonlie Bird with youthfull Pennes and Combe, Doth soare from out her Cradle and her Tombe: So a Small seede that in the Earth lies hidde And dies, reuiuing burstes her cloddie Side, Adorn'd with yellow Lockes, of new is borne, And doth become a Mother great with Corne; Of Graines brings hundreths with it, which when old Enrich the Furrowes with a Sea of Gold. Haile holy Victor, greatest Victor haile, That Hell dost ransacke, against Death preuaile, O how thou long'd for comes! with Iubeling cries, The all-triumphing Palladines of Skies Salute thy rising; Earth would Ioyes no more Beare, if thou rising didst them not restore: A silly Tombe should not his flesh enclose, Who did Heauens trembling Tarasses dispose; No Monument should such a Iewell hold, No Rocke, though Rubye, Diamond, and Gold. Thou onely pittie didst vs, humane Race, Bestowing on vs of thy free giuen Grace More than wee forfaited and loosed first, In Edens Rebell when wee were accurst. Then Earth our portion was, Earths Ioyes but giuen, Earth and Earths Blisse thou hast exchang'd with Heauen. O what a hight of good vpon us streames From the great splendor of thy Bounties Beames! When wee deseru'd shame, horrour, flames of wrath, Thou bled our wounds, and suffer didst our Death; But Fathers Iustice pleas'd, Hell, Death o'rcome, In triumph now thou risest from thy Tombe, With Glories which past Sorrowes contervaile, Haile holy Victor, greatest Victor haile Hence humble sense, and hence yee Guides of sense, Wee now reach Heauen, your weake intelligence And searching Pow'rs, were in a flash made dim, To learne from all eternitie, that him The Father bred, then that hee heere did come (His Bearers Parent) in a Virgins Wombe; But then when sold, betray'd, scourg'd, crown'd with Thorne, Naill'd to a Tree, all breathlesse, bloodlesse, torne, Entomb'd, him rising from a Graue to finde, Confounds your Cunning, turnes like Moles you blinde. Death, thou that heretofore still barren wast, Nay, didst each other Birth eate vp and waste, Imperious, hatefull, pittilesse, vniust, Vnpartiall Equaller of all with dust, Sterne Executioner of heauenly doome, Made fruitfull, now Lifes Mother art become, A sweete releife of cares, the Soule molest, An Harbinger to Glory, Peace and Rest, Put off thy mourning Weedes, yeeld all thy Gall To daylie sinning Life, proud of thy fall, Assemble thy Captiues; bid all hast to rise, And euerie Corse in Earth-quakes where it lies, Sound from each flowrie Graue, and rockie Iaile, Haile holy Victor, greatest Victor haile. The World, that wanning late and faint did lie, Applauding to our ioyes thy Victorie, To a yong Prime essayes to turne againe, And as ere soyl'd with Sinne yet to remaine, Her chilling Agues shee beginnes to misse, All Blisse returning with the Lord of Blisse. With greater light Heauens Temples opened shine, Mornes smiling rise, Euens blushing doe decline, Cloudes dappled glister, boisterous Windes are calme, Soft Zephires doe the Fields with sighes embalme, In ammell blew the Sea hath husht his Roares, And with enamour'd Curles doth kisse the Shoares. All-bearing Earth, like a new-married Queene, Her Beauties hightenes, in a Gowne of Greene Perfumes the Aire, Her Meades are wrought with Flowres, In colours various, figures, smelling, powres; Trees wanton in the Groues with leauie Lockes, Her Hilles empampred stand, the Vales, the Rockes Ring Peales of ioy, her Floods her christall Brookes (The Meadowes tongues) with many maz-like Crookes, And whispering murmures, sound unto the Maine, That Worlds pure Age returned is againe. The honny People leaue their golden Bowres, And innocently pray on budding Flowres; In gloomy Shades, pearcht on the tender Sprayes, The painted Singers fill the Aire with Layes: Seas, Floods, Earth, Aire, all diuerslie doe sound, Yet all their diuerse Notes haue but one ground, Re-ecchoed here downe from Heauens azure Vaile, Haile holy Victor, greatest Victor haile. O Day! on which Deathes Adamantine Chaine The Lord did breake, ransacking Satans Raigne, And in triumphing Pompe his Trophees rear'd, Bee thou blest euer, hence-foorth still endear'd With Name of his owne Day; the Law to Grace, Types to their Substance yeelde, to Thee giue place The olde New-Moones, with all festiuall Dayes, And what aboue the rest deserueth praise The reuerent Saboth; what could else they bee, Than golden Heraulds, telling what by thee Wee should enjoy? Shades past, now shine thou cleare, And hence-foorth bee thou Empresse of the Yeare; This Glorie of thy Sisters sex to winne, From worke on thee, as other Dayes from sinne, That Man-kind shall forbeare, in euerie place The Prince of Planets warmeth in his race; And farre beyond his Pathes in frozen Climes: And may thou bee so blest to out-date Times, That when Heauens Quire shall blaze in accents lowd, The manie mercies of their soueraigne Good, How hee on thee did sinne, Death, Hell destroy, It may bee aye the Antheme of their Ioy. [iii] [An Hymne of the Ascension.] Bright Portalles of the Skie, Emboss'd with sparkling Starres, Doores of Eternitie, With diamantine barres, Your Arras rich vp-hold, Loose all your bolts and Springs, Ope wyde your Leaues of gold; That in your Roofes may come the King of kings. Scarff'd in a rosie Cloud, Hee doth ascend the Aire, Straight doth the Moone him shrowd With her resplendant Haire; The next enchristall'd Light Submits to him its Beames, And hee doth trace the hight Of that faire Lamp which flames of beautie streames. Hee towers those golden Bounds Hee did to Sunne bequeath, The higher wandring Rounds Are found his Feete beneath; The milkie-way comes neare, Heauens Axell seemes to bend, Aboue each turning Spheare That roab'd in Glorie Heauens King may ascend. O Well-spring of this All, Thy Fathers Image viue, Word, that from nought did call What is, doth reason, liue; The Soules eternall Foode, Earths Ioy, Delight of Heauen; All Truth, Loue, Beautie, Good, To Thee, to Thee bee praises euer giuen. What was dismarshall'd late In this thy noble Frame, And lost the prime estate, Hath re-obtain'd the same, Is now most perfect seene; Streames which diuerted were (And troubled strayed vncleene) From their first Source, by Thee home turned are. By Thee that blemish old, Of Edens leprous Prince, Which on his Race tooke hold, And him exyl'd from thence, Now put away is farre; With Sword, in irefull guise, No Cherub more shall barre Poore man the Entries into Paradise. By Thee those Spirits pure, First Children of the Light, Now fixed stand and sure, In their eternall Right; Now humane Companies Renew their ruin'd Wall, Fall'n man as thou makst rise, Thou giu'st to Angels that they shall not fall. By Thee that Prince of Sinne, That doth with mischiefe swell, Hath lost what hee did winne, And shall endungeon'd dwell; His spoyles are made thy pray, His Phanes are sackt and torne, His Altars raz'd away, And what ador'd was late, now lyes a Scorne. These Mansions pure and cleare, Which are not made by hands, Which once by him joy'd were, And his (then not stain'd) Bands (Now forefait'd, dispossest, And head-long from them throwne) Shall Adams Heires make blest, By Thee their great Redeemer made their owne. O Well-spring of this All, Thy Fathers Image viue, Word, that from nought did call, What is, doth Reason, liue; Whose worke is, but to will, Gods coeternall Sonne, Great Banisher of ill, By none but Thee could these great Deedes bee done. Now each etheriall Gate, To him hath opened bin; And glories King in state, His Pallace enters in; Now com'd is this high Prest, In the most holie Place, Not without Blood addrest, With Glorie Heauen the Earth to crowne with Grace. Starres which all Eyes were late, And did with wonder burne, His Name to celebrate, In flaming Tongues them turne; Their orbye Christales moue More actiue than before, And entheate from aboue, Their Soueraigne Prince laude, glorifie, adore. The Quires of happie Soules, Wakt with that Musicke sweete, Whose Descant Care controules, Their Lord in Triumph meete; The spotlesse Sprightes of light, His Trophees doe extole, And archt in Squadrons bright, Greet their great victor in his Capitole. O Glorie of the Heauen, O sole Delight of Earth, To Thee all power bee giuen, Gods vncreated Birth; Of Man-kind louer true, Indeerer of his wrong, Who dost the world renew, Still bee thou our Saluation and our Song. From Top of Oliuet such notes did rise, When mans Redeemer did transcend the Skies. [xvii] [Mans Knowledge, Ignorance in the Misteries of God.] Beneath a sable vaile, and Shadowes deepe, Of Vnaccessible and dimming light, In Silence ebane Clouds more blacke than Night, The Worlds great King his secrets hidde doth keepe: Through those Thicke Mistes when any Mortall Wight Aspires, with halting pace, and Eyes that weepe, To pore, and in his Misteries to creepe, With Thunders hee and Lightnings blastes their Sight. O Sunne invisible, that dost abide Within thy bright abysmes, most faire, most darke, Where with thy proper Rayes thou dost thee hide; O euer-shining, neuer full seene marke, To guide mee in Lifes Night, thy light mee show, The more I search of thee, The lesse I know. [xviii] [Contemplation of Inuisible Excellencies aboue, by the Visible below.] If with such passing Beautie, choise Delights, The Architect of this great Round did frame This Pallace visible (short listes of Fame, And sillie Mansion but of dying Wights) How many Wonders, what amazing Lights Must that triumphing Seat of Glorie clame, That doth transcend all this great Alls vaste hights, Of whose bright Sunne ours heere is but a Beame? O blest abod! O happie dwelling-place! Where visiblie th' Invisible doth raigne, Blest People which doe see true Beauties Face, With whose farre Dawnings scarce he Earth doth daigne: All Ioy is but Annoy, all Concord Strife, Match'd with your endlesse Blisse and happie life. [iii] [The Difference betweene Earthlie and Heauenlie Loue.] Loue which is heere a Care, That Wit and Will doth marre, Vncertaine Truce, and a most certaine Warre; A shrill tempestuous Winde, Which doth disturbe the minde, And like wilde Waues our designes all commoue: Among those Powres aboue, Which see their Makers Face, It a contentment is, a quiet Peace, A Pleasure voide of Griefe, a constant Rest, Eternall Ioy, which nothing can molest. [xix] [Earth and all on it Changeable.] That space, where raging Waues doe now diuide From the great Continent our happie Isle, Was some-time Land, and where tall Shippes doe glide, Once with deare Arte the crooked Plough did tyle: Once those faire Bounds stretcht out so farre and wide, Where Townes, no, Shires enwall'd, endeare each mile, Were all ignoble Sea, and marish vile Where Proteus Flockes danc'd measures to the Tyde. So Age transforming all still forward runnes, No wonder though the Earth doth change her face, New Manners, Pleasures new, turne with new Sunnes, Lockes now like Gold grow to an hoarie grace; Nay, Mindes rare shape doth change, that lyes despis'd Which was so deare of late and highlie pris'd. [iv] [The World a Game.] This world a Hunting is, The Pray poore Man, the Nimrod fierce is Death, His speedie Grei-hounds are, Lust, sicknesse, Enuie, Care, Strife that neere falles amisse, With all those ills which haunt vs while wee breath. Now, if (by chance) wee flie Of these the eager Chase, Old Age with stealing Pace, Castes vp his Nets, and there wee panting die. [xx] [The Court of True Honour.] Why (worldlings) do ye trust fraile honours dreams? And leane to guilted Glories which decay? Why doe yee toyle to registrate your Names On ycie Pillars, which soone melt away? True Honour is not heere, that place it clames, Where blacke-brow'd Night doth not exile the Day, Nor no farre-shining Lamp diues in the Sea, But an eternall Sunne spreades lasting Beames: There it attendeth you, where spotlesse Bands Of Spirits, stand gazing on their Soueraigne Blisse, Where yeeres not hold it in their canckring hands, But who once noble, euer noble is. Looke home, lest hee your weakned Wit make thrall, Who Edens foolish Gardner earst made fall. [xxi] [Against Hypocrisie.] As are those Apples, pleasant to the Eye, But full of Smoke within, which vse to grow Neere that strange Lake, where God powr'd from the Skie Huge showres of Flames, worse flames to ouer-throw: Such are their workes that with a glaring Show Of humble Holinesse, in Vertues dye, Would colour Mischiefe, while within they glow With coales of Sinne, though none the Smoake descrie. Ill is that Angell which earst fell from Heauen, But not more ill than hee, nor in worse case, Who hides a traitrous Minde with smiling face, And with a Doues white feathers maskes a Rauen: Each Sinne some colour hath it to adorne, Hypocrisie All-mighty God doth scorne. [v] [Change should breede Change.] New doth the Sunne appeare, The Mountaines Snowes decay, Crown'd with fraile Flowres foorth comes the Babye yeare. My Soule, Time postes away, And thou yet in that Frost Which Flowre and fruit hath lost, As if all heere immortall were, dost stay: For shame thy Powers awake, Looke to that Heauen which neuer Night makes blacke, And there, at that immortall Sunnes bright Rayes, Decke thee with Flowers which feare not rage of Dayes. [xxii] [The Praise of a Solitarie Life.] Thrice happie hee, who by some shadie Groue, Farre from the clamorous World, doth liue his owne, Though solitarie, who is not alone, But doth conuerse with that Eternall Loue: O! how more sweete is Birds harmonious Moane, Or the hoarse Sobbings of the widow'd Doue; Than those smooth whisperings neere a Princes Throne, Which Good make doubtfull, doe the euill approue? O! how more sweet is Zephires wholesome Breath, And Sighes embalm'd, which new-borne Flowrs vnfold, Than that applause vaine Honour doth bequeath? How sweete are Streames to poison drunke in Gold? The World is full of Horrours, Troubles, Slights, Woods harmelesse Shades haue only true Delightes. [xxiii] [To a Nightingale.] Sweet Bird, that sing'st away the early Howres, Of Winters past or comming void of Care, Well pleased with Delights which Present are, Faire Seasones, budding Sprayes, sweet-smelling Flowers: To Rocks, to Springs, to Rils, from leauy Bowres Thou thy Creators Goodnesse dost declare, And what deare Gifts on thee hee did not spare, A Staine to humane sence in sinne that lowres. What Soule can be so sicke, which by thy Songs (Attir'd in sweetnesse) sweetly is not driuen Quite to forget Earths turmoiles, spights, and wrongs, And lift a reuerend Eye and Thought to Heauen? Sweet Artlesse Songstarre, thou my Minde dost raise To Ayres of Spheares, yes, and to Angels Layes. [xxiv] [Content and Resolute.] As when it hapneth that some louely Towne Vnto a barbarous Besieger falles, Who there by Sword and Flame himselfe enstalles, And (Cruell) it in Teares and Blood doth drowne; Her Beauty spoyl'd, her Citizens made Thralles, His spight yet so cannot her all throw downe, But that some Statue, Arch, Phan of renowne, Yet lurkes vnmaym'd within her weeping walles: So after all the Spoile, Disgrace, and Wrake, That Time, the World, and Death could bring combind, Amidst that Masse of Ruines they did make, Safe and all scarre-lesse yet remaines my Minde: From this so high transcending Rapture springes, That I, all else defac'd, not enuie Kinges. [xxv] [Deathes Last-Will.] More oft than once, Death whisper'd in mine Eare, Graue what thou heares in Diamond and Gold, I am that Monarch whom all Monarches feare, Who hath in Dust their farre-stretch'd Pride vproll'd. All all is mine beneath Moones siluer Spheare, And nought, saue Vertue, Can my power with-hold: This (not belieu'd) Experience true Thee told, By Danger late when I to Thee came neare. As Bugbeare then my Visage I did show, That of my Horrours thou right Vse mightst make, And a more sacred Path of liuing take: Now still walke armed for my ruthlesse Blow, Trust flattering Life no more, Redeeme Time past, And Liue each Day as if it were thy Last. [xxvi] [The Blessednesse of Faithfull Soules by Death.] Let vs each day enure our selues to dye, If this (and not our Feares) be truely Death; Aboue the Circles both of Hope and Faith With faire immortall pinniones to flie? If this be Death our best Part to vntie (By ruining the Iaile) from Lust and Wrath, And euery drowsie languor heere beneath, It turning deniz'd Citizen of Skie? To haue, more knowledge than all Bookes containe, All Pleasures euen surmounting wishing Powre, The fellowship of Gods immortall Traine, And these that Time nor force shall er'e deuoure? If this be Death? what Ioy, what golden care Of Life, can with Deaths ouglinesse compare? [iv] [An Hymne of True Happinesse.] Amidst the azure cleare Of Iordans sacred Streames, Iordan of Libanon the of-spring deare; When Zephires Flowers vnclose, And Sunne shines with new Beames, With graue and stately Grace a Nimphe arose. Vpon her Head she ware Of Amaranthes a Crowne, Her left hand Palmes, her right a Brandon bare, Vnvail'd Skinnes whitenesse lay, Gold haires in Curles hang downe, Eyes sparkled Ioy, more bright than Starre of Day. The Flood a Throne her rear'd Of Waues, most like that Heauen Where beaming Starres in Glorie turne ensphear'd; The Aire stood calme and cleare, No Sigh by Windes was giuen, Birdes left to sing, Heards feed, her voyce to heare. World-wandring sorrie Wights, Whom nothing can content Within those varying listes of Dayes and Nights, Whose life (ere knowne amisse) In glittering Griefes is spent, Come learne (said shee) what is your choisest Blisse. From Toyle and pressing Cares How yee may respit finde, A Sanctuarie from Soule-thralling Snares, A Port to harboure sure In spight of waues and winde, Which shall when Times Houre-glasse is runne endure. Not happie is that Life Which yee as happie hold, No, but a Sea of feares, a field of Strife, Charg'd on a Throne to sit With Diadems of Gold, Preseru'd by Force, and still obseru'd by Wit: Huge Treasures to enioy, Of all her Gemmes spoyle Inde, All Seres silke in Garments to imploy, Deliciously to feed, The Phenix plumes to finde To rest vpon, or decke your purple Bed. Fraile Beautie to abuse, And (wanton Sybarites) On past or present touch of sense to muse; Neuer to heare of Noise But what the Eare delites, Sweet musicks Charmes, or charming Flatterers voice. Nor can it Blisse you bring, Hidde Natures Depthes to know, Why Matter changeth, whence each Forme doth spring; Nor that your Fame should range, And after-Worlds it blow From Tänäis to Nile, from Nile to Gange. All these haue not the Powre To free the Minde from feares, Nor hideous horror can allay one howre, When Death in steele doth glance, In Sicknesse lurke or yeares, And wakes the Soule from out her mortall Trance. No, but blest Life is this, With chaste and pure desire, To turne vnto the Load-starre of all Blisse, On GOD the Minde to rest, Burnt vp with sacred Fire, Possessing him, to bee by him possest. When to the baulmie East Sunne doth his light impart, Or When hee diueth in the lowlie West, And rauisheth the Day, With spotlesse Hands and Hart Him chearefully to praise and to him pray. To heed each action so, As euer in his sight, More fearing doing ill than passiue woe; Not to seeme other thing Than what yee are aright, Neuer to doe what may Repentance bring: Not to bee blowne with Pride, Nor mou'd at Glories breath, Which Shadow-like on wings of Time doth glide; So Malice to disarme, And conquere hastie Wrath, As to doe good to those that Worke your harme: To hatch no base Desires Or Gold or Land to gaine, Well pleas'd with what by Vertue one acquires, To haue the Wit and Will Consorting in one Straine, Than what is good to haue no higher skill. Neuer on Neighbours well, With Cocatrices Eye To looke, and make an others Heauen your Hell; Not to be Beauties Thrall, All fruitlesse Loue to flie, Yet louing still a Loue transcending all. A Loue which while it burnes The Soule with fairest Beames, In that vncreated Sunne the Soule it turnes, And makes such Beautie proue, That (if Sense saw her Gleames?) All lookers on would pine and die for loue. Who such a life doth liue, Yee happie euen may call, Ere ruthlesse Death a wished end him giue, And after then when giuen, More happie by his fall, For Humanes, Earth, enioying Angels, Heauen. Swift is your mortall Race, And glassie is the Field, Vaste are Desires not limited by Grace; Life a weake Tapper is, Then while it light doth yeeld Leaue flying ioyes, embrace this lasting Blisse. This when the Nimph had said, Shee diu'd within the Flood, Whose Face with smyling Curles long after staid. Then Sighes did Zephyres presse, Birdes sang from euery Wood, And Ecchoes rang, this was true Happinesse. [v] AN HYMNE OF THE FAIREST FAIRE. [An Hymne of the Nature, Atributes, and Workes of God.] I feele my Bosome glow with wontlesse Fires, Rais'd from the vulgar prease my Mind aspires (Wing'd with high Thoghts) vnto his praise to clime, From deepe Eternitie who call'd foorth Time; That Essence which not mou'd makes each thing moue, Vncreat'd Beautie all-creating Loue: But by so great an object, radient light, My Heart appall'd, enfeebled restes my Sight, Thicke Cloudes benighte my labouring Ingine, And at my high Attempts my Wits repine. If thou in mee this sacred Rapture wrought, My Knowledge sharpen, Sarcells lend my thought; Grant mee (Times Father, world-containing King) A Pow'r, of Thee in pow'rfull Layes to sing, That as thy Beautie in Earth liues, Heauen shines, So it may dawne, or shadow in my Lines. As farre beyond the starrie walles of Heauen, As is the loftiest of the Planets seuen Sequestred from this Earth, in purest light, Out-shining ours, as ours doth sable Night, Thou, All-sufficient, Omnipotent, Thou euer-glorious, most excellent, GOD various in Names, in Essence one, High art enstalled on a golden Throne, Out-reaching Heauens wide Vastes, the Bounds of nought, Transcending all the Circles of our Thought: With diamantine Scepter in thy Hand, There thou giu'st Lawes, and dost this World command, This world of Concords rais'd vnliklie-sweete, Which like a Ball lyes prostrate to thy Feete. If so wee may well say (and what wee say, Heere wrapt in flesh, led by dimme Reasons ray, To show by earthlie Beauties which wee see That spirituall Excellence that shines in Thee, Good Lord forgiue) not farre from thy right Side, With curled Lockes Youth euer doth abide; Rose-cheeked Youth, who garlanded with Flowres, Still blooming, ceasleslie vnto thee powres Immortall Nectar, in a Cuppe of Gold, That by no darts of Ages Thou grow old, And as ends and beginnings Thee not clame, Successionlesse that Thou bee still the same. Neare to thy other side resistlesse Might, From Head to Foote in burnisht Armour dight, That ringes about him, with a wauing Brand, And watchfull Eye, great Sentinell doth stand; That neither Time nor force in ought impaire Thy workmanshippe, nor harme thine Empire faire, Soone to giue Death to all againe that would Sterne Discord raise which thou destroy'd of old; Discord that Foe to order, Nurse of Warre, By which the noblest things dimolisht are: But (Catife) Shee no Treason doth deuise, When Might to nought doth bring her enterprise, Thy All-vpholding Might her Malice raines, And her in Hell throwes bound in iron Chaines. With Lockes in waues of Gold that ebbe and flow On yuorie necke, in Robes more white than Snow, Truth stedfastlie before thee holdes a Glasse, Indent'd with Gemmes, where shineth all that was, That is, or shall bee: heere, ere ought was wrought, Thou knew all that thy Pow'r with Time forth-brought, And more, Things numberlesse which thou couldst make, That actuallie shall neuer beeing take: Heere, thou beholdst thy selfe, and (strange) dost proue, At once the Beautie, Louer and the Loue. With Faces two (like Sisters) sweetlie faire, Whose Blossomes no rough Autumne can impaire, Stands Prouidence, and doth her lookes disperse Through euerie Corner of this Vniuerse: Thy Prouidence at once which generall Things And singulare doth rule, as Empires Kings; Without whose care this world (lost) would remaine, As Shippe without a Maister in the Maine, As Chariot alone, as Bodies proue Depriu'd of Soules by which they bee, liue, moue. But who are They which shine thy Throne so neare? With sacred countenance, and looke seuere, This in one hand a pondrous Sword doth hold, Her left stayes charg'd with Ballances of Gold; That with Browes girt with Bayes, sweete-smiling Face, Doth beare a Brandon, with a babish grace Two milke-white Winges him easilie doe moue, O Shee thy Iustice is, and this thy Loue! By this thou brought this Engine great to light, By that it fram'd in Number, Measure, Weight, That destine doth reward to ill and good; But Sway of Iustice is by Loue with-stood, Which did it not relent and mildlie stay, This World ere now had had its funerall Day. What Bands (enclustred) neare to these abide, Which into vaste Infinitie them hide? Infinitie that neither doth admit, Place, Time, nor Number to encroach on it: Heere Bountie sparkleth, heere doth Beautie shine, Simplicitie, more white than Gelsemine, Mercie with open wings, ay-varied Blisse, Glorie, and Ioy, that Blesses darling is. Ineffable, All-pow'rfull GOD, All-free, Thou onelie liu'st, and each thing liues by Thee, No Ioy, no, nor Perfection to Thee came By the contriuing of this Worlds great Frame; Ere Sunne, Moone, Starres beganne their restlesse race, Ere paint'd with purple Light was Heauens round Face, Ere Aire had Clouds, ere Clouds weept down their showrs, Ere Sea embraced Earth, ere Earth bare Flowres, Thou happie liu'd; World nought to Thee supply'd, All in thy selfe thy selfe thou satisfy'd: Of Good no slender Shadow doth appeare, No age-worne tracke, in Thee which shin'd not cleare; Perfections Summe, prime-cause of euerie Cause, Midst, end, beginning, where all good doth pause. Hence of thy Substance, differing in nought Thou in Eternitie thy Sonne foorth brought, The onelie Birth of thy vnchanging Minde, Thine Image, Paterne-like that euer shin'd, Light out of Light, begotten not by Will, But Nature, all and that same Essence still Which thou thy selfe; for thou dost nought possesse Which hee hath not, in ought nor is hee lesse Than Thou his great Begetter; of this Light, Eternall, double, kindled was thy Spright Eternallie, who is with Thee the same, All-holie Gift, Embassadour, Knot, Flame: Most sacred, Triade, O most holie One, Vnprocreat'd Father, euer-procreat'd Sonne, Ghost breath'd from both, you were, are, aye shall bee (Most blessed) Three in One, and One in Three, Vncomprehensible by reachlesse Hight, And vnperceiued by excessiue Light. So in our Soules, three and yet one are still, The Vnderstanding, Memorie, and Will; So (though vnlike) the Planet of the Dayes, So soone as hee was made begate his Rayes, Which are his Of-spring, and from both was hurl'd The rosie Light which comfort doth the World, And none fore-went an other: so the Spring, The Well-head, and the Streame which they foorth bring, Are but one selfe-same Essence, nor in ought Doe differ, saue in order, and our Thought No Chime of time discernes in them to fall, But three distinctlie bide one Essence all. But these expresse not Thee; who can declare Thy beeing? Men and Angels dazel'd are: Who force this Eden would with wit or sence, A Cherubin shall finde to barre him thence. Alls Architect, Lord of this Uniuerse, Wit is ingulph'd that would thy greatnesse pierce; Ah! as a Pilgrime who the Alpes doth passe, Or Atlas Temples crown'd with winters glasse, The ayrie Caucasus, the Apennine, Pyrenès cliftes where Sunne doth neuer shine, When hee some heapes of Hilles hath ouer-went, Beginnes to thinke on rest, his Iourney spent, Till mounting some tall Mountaine hee doe finde, More hights before him than hee left behinde: With halting pace, so while I would mee raise To the vnbounded Circüits of thy praise, Some part of way I thought to haue o're-runne, But now I see how scarce I haue begunne, With wonders new my Spirits range possest, And wandring waylesse in a maze them rest. In those vaste Fieldes of Light, etheriall Plaines, Thou art attended by immortall Traines Of Intellectuall Pow'rs, which thou brought forth To praise thy Goodnesse, and admire thy Worth; In numbers passing other Creatures farre, Since most in number noblest Creatures are, Which doe in Knowledge vs no lesse out-runne, Than Moone doth Starres in light, or Moone the Sunne; Vnlike, in Orders rang'd and manie a Band, (If Beautie in Disparitie doth stand?) Arch-Angels, Angels, Cherubes, Seraphines, And what with name of Thrones amongst them shines, Large-ruling Princes, Dominations, Powres, All-acting Vertues of those flaming Towres: These fred of Vmbrage, these of Labour free, Rest rauished with still beholding Thee, Inflam'd with Beames which sparkle from thy Face, They can no more desire, farre lesse embrace. Low vnder them, with slow and staggering pace Thy hand-Maide Nature thy great Steppes doth trace, The Source of second Causes, golden Chaine That linkes this Frame, as thou it doth ordaine; Nature gaz'd on with such a curious Eye That Earthlings oft her deem'd a Deitye. By Nature led those Bodies faire and greate Which faint not in their Course, nor change their State, Vnintermixt, which no disorder proue, Though aye and contrarie they alwayes moue; The Organes of thy Prouidence diuine, Bookes euer open, Signes that clearelie shine, Times purpled Maskers, then doe them aduance, As by sweete Musicke in a measur'd Dance. Starres, Hoste of heauen, yee Firmaments bright Flowrs, Cleare Lampes which ouer-hang this Stage of ours, Yee turne not there to decke the Weeds of Night, Nor Pageant-like to please the vulgare Sight, Great Causes sure yee must bring great Effectes, But who can descant right your graue Aspects? Hee onlie who You made deciphere can Your Notes, Heauens Eyes, yee blinde the Eyes of Man. Amidst these saphire farre-extending Hights, The neuer-twinkling euer-wandring Lights Their fixed Motions keepe; one drye and cold, Deep-leaden colour'd, slowlie there is roll'd, With Rule and Line for times steppes measur'd euen, In twice three Lustres hee but turnes his Heauen. With temperate qualities and Countenance faire, Still mildelie smiling sweetlie debonnaire, An other cheares the World, and way doth make In twice sixe Autumnes through the Zodiacke. But hote and drye with flaming lockes and Browes Enrag'd, this in his red Pauillion glowes: Together running with like speede if space, Two equallie in hands atchieue their race; With blushing Face this oft doth bring the Day, And vsheres oft to statelie Starres the way, That various in vertue, changing, light, With his small Flame engemmes the vaile of Night. Prince of this Court, the Sunne in triumph rides, With the yeare Snake-like in her selfe that glides; Times Dispensator, faire life-giuing Source, Through Skies twelue Posts as hee doth runne his course, Heart of this All, of what is knowne to Sence The likest to his Makers Excellence: In whose diurnall motion doth appeare A Shadow, no, true pourtrait of the yeare. The Moone moues lowest, siluer Sunne of Night, Dispersing through the World her borrow'd light, Who in three formes her head abroad doth range, And onelie constant is in constant Change. Sad Queene of Silence, I neere see thy Face, To waxe, or waine, or shine with a full grace, But straight (amaz'd) on Man I thinke, each Day His state who changeth, or if hee find Stay, It is in drearie anguish, cares, and paines, And of his Labours Death is all the Gaines. Immortall Monarch, can so fond a Thought Lodge in my brest? as to trust thou first brought Heere in Earths shadie Cloister wretched Man, To sucke the Aire of woe, to spend Lifes span Midst Sighes and plaints, a stranger vnto Mirth, To giue himselfe his Death rebuking Birth? By sense and wit of Creatures Made King, By sense and wit to liue their Vnderling? And what is worst, haue Eaglets eyes to see His owne disgrace, and know an high degree Of Blisse, the Place, if thereto hee might clime, And not liue thrallèd to imperious Time? Or (dotard) shall I so from Reason swerue, To deeme those Lights which to our vse doe serue, (For thou dost not them need) more noblie fram'd Than vs, that know their course, and haue them nam'd? No, I neere thinke but wee did them surpasse As farre, as they doe Asterismes of Glasse, When thou vs made; by Treason high defil'd, Thrust from our first estate wee liue exil'd, Wandring this Earth, which is of Death the Lot, Where he doth vse the Pow'r which he hath got, Indifferent Umpire vnto Clownes and Kings, The supreame Monarch of all mortall things. When first this flowrie Orbe was to vs giuen It but in place disualu'd was to Heauen, These Creatures which now our Soueraignes are, And as to Rebelles doe denounce vs warre, Then were our Uassalles, no tumultuous Storme, No Thunders, Quakings, did her Forme deforme, The Seas in tumbling Mountaines did not roare, But like moist Christall whispered on the Shoare, No Snake did met her Meads, nor ambusht lowre In azure Curles beneath the sweet-Spring Flowre; The Nightshade, Henbane, Naple, Aconite, Her Bowels then not bare, with Death to smite Her guiltlesse Brood; thy Messengers of Grace, As their high Rounds did haunte this lower Place: O Ioy of Ioyes! with our first Parents Thou To commune then didst daigne, as Friends doe now: Against thee wee rebell'd, and iustly thus, Each Creature rebelled against vs, Earth, reft of what did chiefe in her excell, To all became a Iaile, to most a Hell, In Times full Terme vntill thy Sonne was giuen, Who Man with Thee, Earth reconcil'd with Heauen. Whole and entire all in thy Selfe thou art, All-where diffus'd, yet of this All no part, For infinite, in making this faire Frame, (Great without quantitie) in all thou came, And filling all, how can thy State admit, Or Place or Substance to be voide of it? Were Worlds as many, as the Raies which streame From Heauens bright Eyes, or madding Wits do dreame, They would not reele in nought, nor wandring stray, But draw to Thee, who could their Centers stay; Were but one houre this World disioyn'd from Thee, It in one houre to nought reduc'd should bee, For it thy shaddow is, and can they last, If seuer'd from the Substances them cast? O only blest, and Author of all blisse, No Blisse it selfe, that all-where wished is, Efficient, exemplarie, finall Good, Of thine owne Selfe but onely vnderstood; Light is thy Curtaine, thou art Light of Light, An euer-waking Eye still shining bright, In-looking all, exempt of passiue powre, And change, in change since Deaths pale shade doth lowre. All Times to thee are one, that which hath runne, And that which is not brought yet by the Sunne, To thee are present, who dost alwayes see In present act, what past is or to bee. Day-liuers wee rememberance doe losse Of Ages worne, so Miseries vs tosse, (Blinde and lethargicke of thy heauenly Grace, Which sinne in our first Parents did deface, And euen while Embryones curst by iustest doome) That wee neglect what gone is, or to come: But thou in thy great Archieues scrolled hast In parts and whole, what euer yet hath past, Since first the marble wheeles of Time were roll'd, As euer liuing, neuer waxing old, Still is the same thy Day and Yesterday, An vn-diuided Now, a constant Ay. O King, whose Greatnesse none can comprehend, Whose boundlesse Goodnesse doth to all extend, Light of all Beautie, Ocean without ground, That standing flowest, giuing dost abound, Rich palace, and Indweller euer blest, Neuer not working euer yet in Rest; What wit cannot conceiue, words say of Thee, Heere where as in a Mirrour wee but see, Shadowes of shadowes, Atomes of thy Might, Still owlie eyed when staring on thy Light, Grant that released from this earthly Iaile, And fred of Clouds which heere our Knowledge vaile, In Heauens high Temples, where thy Praises ring, I may in sweeter Notes heare Angels sing. [vi] [A Prayer for Mankinde.] Great GOD, whom wee with humble Thoughts adore, Eternall, infinite, Almightie King, Whose Dwellings Heauen transcend, whose Throne before Archangells serue, and Seraphines doe sing; Of nought who wrought all that With wondring Eyes Wee doe behold within this spacious Round, Who makes the Rockes to rocke, to stand the Skies, At whose command Clouds dreadfull Thunders sound: Ah! spare vs Wormes, weigh not how wee (alas!) (Euill to our selues) against thy Lawes rebell, Wash of those Spots which still in Mindes cleare Glasse (Though wee be loath to looke) wee see to well. Deseru'd Reuenge, O doe not doe not take, Doe thou reuenge what shall abide thy blow? Passe shall this World, this World which thou didst make, Which should not perish till thy Trumpet blow. What Soule is found whom Parents Crime not staines? Or what with its owne Sinne destaind is not? Though Iustice Rigor threaten (ah) her Raines Let Mercy guide, and neuer bee forgot. Lesse are our Faults farre farre than is thy Loue, O What can better seeme thy Grace diuine, Than They that plagues deserue thy Bounty proue, And where thou showre mayst Vengeance faire to shine? Then looke and pittie, pittying forgiue Vs guiltie Slaues, or Seruants, now in thrall, Slaues, if (alas) thou looke how wee doe liue; Or doing ill Or doing nought at all? Of an vngratefull Minde a foule Effect! But if thy Giftes which amplie heretofore Thou hast vpon vs powr'd thou dost respect, Wee are thy Seruants, nay, than Seruants more; Thy Children, yes, and Children dearely bought, But what strange Chance vs of this Lot bereaues, Poore worthles Wights how lowlie are wee brought, Whom Grace made Children Sinne hath turned Slaues? Sinne hath turn'd Slaues, but let those Bands Grace breake, That in our Wrongs thy Mercies may appeare, Thy Wisedome not so meane is, Pow'r so weake, But thousand wayes they can make Worlds thee feare. O Wisedome boundlesse! O miraculous Grace! Grace, Wisedome which make winke dimme Reasons Eye, And could Heauens King bring from his placelesse Place, On this ignoble Stage of Care to die: To dye our Death, and with the sacred Streame Of Bloud and Water, guishing from his Side, To put away each odious act and Blame, By vs contriu'd, or our first Parents Pride. Thus thy great Loue and Pitty (heauenly King) Loue, Pitty, which so well our Losse preuent, Of Euill it selfe (loe!) could all Goodnesse bring, And sad Beginning cheare with glad Euent. O Loue and Pitty! ill-knowne of these Times. O Loue and Pittie! carefull of our neede, O Bounties! Which our execrable Crimes (Now numberlesse) contend neere to exceed. Make this excessiue Ardour of thy Loue, So warme our Coldnesse, so our Lifes renew, That wee from sinne, Sinne may from vs remoue, Wit may our will, Faith may our Wit subdue. Let thy pure Loue burne vp all worldly Lust, Hells pleasant Poison killing our best part, Which makes vs ioye in Toyes, adore fraile Dust In stead of Thee, in Temple of our Heart. Grant when at last our Soules these Bodies leaue, Their loathsome Shops of Sinne, and Mansions blinde, And Doome before thy royall Seat receaue, They may a Sauiour, not a Iudge thee finde. [vii] THE SHADOW OF THE IVDGEMENT [An Essay of the Great and Generall Iudgement of the World.] Aboue those boundlesse Bounds where Starrs do moue, The Seeling of the christall Round aboue, And Raine-bow-sparkling Arch of Diamond cleare, Which crownes the azure of each vnder Spheare, In a rich Mansion radiant with light, To which the Sunne is scarce a Taper bright, Which, though a Bodie, yet so pure is fram'd, That almost spirituall it may bee nam'd; Where Blisse aboundeth, and a lasting May All Pleasures heightning flourisheth for ay, The King of Ages dwells. About his Throne (Like to those Beames Days golden Lamp hath on) Angelike Splendors glance, more swift than ought Reueal'd to sence, nay, than the winged Thought, His will to practise: here doe Seraphines Burne with immortall loue, there Cherubines With other noble people of the Light, As Eaglets in the Sunne, delight their Sight: Heauens ancient Denizones, pure actiue Powres, Which (fred of death) that Cloister high embowres, Etheriall Princes, euer-conquering Bandes, Blest Subjectes acting what their King commandes; Sweet Quiristers, by whose melodious Straines Skies dance, and Earth vntyr'd their Brawle sustaines. Mixed among whose sacred legiones deare The spotlesse Soules of Humanes doe appeare, Deuesting Bodies which did Cares deuest, And there liue happie in eternall Rest. Hither, sure-charg'd with griefe, fraught with Annoy, (Sad Spectacle into that place of Ioy) Her Haire disordered dangling o're her Face, Which had of pallid Violets the grace, The Crimsin Mantle wont her to adorne Cast loose about, and in large peeces torne, Sighes breathing forth, and from her heauie Eyne Along her Cheekes distilling christall Brine, Which downe-wards to her yuorie Brest was driuen, And had bedewed the milkie-Way of Heauen, Came Pietie: at her left hand neare by A wailing Woman bare her Company, Whose tender Babes her snowie Necke did clip, And now hang on her Pappe now by her Lip: Flames glanc'd her Head aboue, which once did glow, But late looke pale (a Poore and ruthfull Show!) Shee sobbing shrunke the Throne of God before, And thus beganne her Case to him deplore. Forlorne, wretch'd, desolate, to whom should I My Refuge haue, below or in the Skie, But vnto thee? see (all beholding King) That Seruant, no, that Darling thou didst bring On Earth, lost Man to saue from Hells Abisme, And raise vnto these Regiones aboue Tyme; Who made thy Name so truelie bee implor'd, And by the reuerent Soule so long ador'd, Her banisht now see from these lower Boundes, Behold her Garments Shreedes her Bodies woundes; Looke how her Sister Charitie there standes, Proscrib'd on Earth, all maim'd by wicked Handes: Mischeefe there mountes to such an high degree, That there, now none is left who cares for mee. There dwelles Idolatrie, there Atheisme raignes, There Man in dombe, yet roaring, sinnes him staines; So foolish, that hee Puppets will adore Of Mettall, Stone, and Birds, Beastes, Trees, before Hee once will to thy hollie seruice bow, And yeelde the Homage: Ah alas! yee now To those black Sprightes which thou dost keepe in chaines Hee vowes Obedience, and with shamefull paines Infernall Horroures courtes; Case fond and strange! To Bane than Blisse desiring more the Change. Thy Charitie of Graces once the Cheife, Did long tyme find in Hospitalls reliefe; Which now lye leuell'd with the lowest Ground, Where sad memorialls scarce are of them found. Then (Vagabounding) Temples her receau'd, Where my Poore Cells afforded what she crau'd; But now thy Temples raz'd are, humane Blood Those Places staines, late where thy Altares stood: Tymes are so horrid, to implore thy Name, That it is held now on the Earth a Blame. Now doth the Warriour with his Dart and Sword Write lawes in blood, and vent them for thy word; Relligion, Faith pretending to make knowne, All haue all Faith, Religion quite o'rthrowne, Men awlesse, lawlesse liue (most woefull case!) Men, no more men, a GOD-contemning Race. Scarce had shee said, when from the neither World, (Like to a Lightning through the Welken hurl'd, That scores with Flames the way, and euerie eye With Terrour dazelles as it swimmeth by) Came Iustice: to whom Angels did make place, And Truth her flying foote-steppes straight did trace. Her Sword was lost, the precious Weights shee bare, Their Beame had torne, Scales rudlie bruised were: From off her head was reft her golden Crowne, In ragges her Vaile was rent and starre-spangl'd Gowne, Her teare-wette Lockes hange o're her Face, which made Betweene her and the mightie King a Shade. Iust wrath had rais'd her colour (like the Morne Portending Clouds moist Embryones to bee borne) Of which shee taking leaue, with Heart swollen great, Thus stroue to plaine before the Throne of State. Is not the Earth thy worke-man-ship (great King) Didst Thou not all this All from nought once bring To this rich Beautie which doth on it shine: Bestowing on each Creature of thine Some Shadow of thy Bountie? Is not Man Thy Vassall, plac'd to spend his lifes short Span To doe Thee Homage: and then didst not Thou A Queene installe mee there, to whom should bow Thy Earths Endwellers, and to this effect Put in my hand thy Sword? O high Neglect! Now wretched Earthlings, to thy great disgrace, Peruerted haue my Pow'r, and doe deface All reuerent trackes of Iustice; now the Earth, Is but a Frame of Shame, a funerall Harth, Where euerie Vertue hath consumed beene, And nought (no not their dust) restes to bee seene Long hath it mee abhor'd, long chased mee, Expelled last, heere I haue fled to Thee, And foorth-with rather would to Hell repaire, Than Earth, sith Iustice execute is there. All liue on Earth by Spoyle, the Host his Guest Betrayes, the Man of her lyes in his Brest Is not assured; the Sonne the Fathers death Attempts, and Kinred Kinred reaue of Breath By lurking meanes, of such Age few makes sicke, Since Hell disgorg'd her banefull Arsenicke. Whom Murthers, foule Assasinates defile, Most who the harmelesse Innocent beguile, Who most can rauage, robe, ransacke, blasphame, Is held most vertuous, hath a Worthies name; So on emboldned Malice they relye, That (madding) thy great Puissance they defye: Earst man resembl'd thy Pourtrait soyl'd by Smooke, Now like thy Creature hardlie doth hee looke. Olde Nature heere (Shee pointed where there stood An aged Ladie in a heauie Mood) Doth breake her Staffe, denying humane Race To come of Her, Things borne to her disgrace! The Doue the Doue, the Swan doth loue the Swan, Nought so relentlesse vnto man as Man. O! if thou madst this World, gouern'st it all, Deserued vengeance on the Earth let fall; The Periode of her standing perfect is, Her Houre-glasse not a Minute short doth misse. The End (O Lord) is come, then let no more Mischiefe still triumph, Bad the Good deuoure, But of thy Word sith Constant, true, Thou art, Giue Good their Guerdon, wicked due Desart. Shee said: Through out the shining Palace went A Murmure soft, such as a farre is sent By musked Zephires Sighes along the Maine, Or when they curle some flowrie Lea and Plaine; One was their Thought, one their Intention, Will, Nor could they erre Truth there residing still: All (mou'd with zeale) as one with cryes did pray, Hasten (O Lord) O hasten the last Day. Looke how a generous Prince, when hee doth heare, Some louing Citie and to him most deare, Which wont with Giftes, and Showes him intertaine (And as a Fathers did obey his Raigne) A rout of Slaues and rascall foes to wracke, Her Buildings ouer-throw, her Richesse sacke, Feeles vengefull Flames within his bosome burne, And a just rage all Respects ouer-turne: So seeing Earth, of Angels once the Inne, Mansion of Saintes, deflowred all by sinne, And quite confus'd, by wretches heere beneath, The worlds great Soueraigne moued was to Wrath. Thrice did hee rouse himselfe, thrice from his Face, Flames sparkle did throughout the heauenlie place. The Starres, though fixed, in their Rounds did quake, The Earth, and Earth-embracing Sea did shake: Carmell and Hæmus felt it, Athos Topes Affrighted shrunke, and neare the Æthiopes Atlas, the Pyrenèes, the Appennine, And loftie Grampius, which with Snow doth shine. Then to the Synode of the Sprights hee swore, Mans care should end, and Tyme should bee no more; By his owne Selfe hee swore of perfect worth, Straight to performe his word sent Angels forth. There lyes an Island, where the radiant Sunne, When hee doth to the northerne Tropicke runne, Of sex long Monethes makes one tedious Day, And when through southerne Signes he holds his way, Sex Monethes turneth in one loathsome Night (Night neither heere is faire, nor Day hote-bright, But halfe white and halfe More) where sadlie cleare Still coldlie glance the Beames of either Beare, The frostie Groen-land. On the lonlie Shore The Ocean in Mountaines hoarse doth roare, And ouer-tumbling, tumbling ouer Rockes, Castes various Raine-bowes, which in Froth he choakes; Gulfes all about are shrunke most strangelie steepe, Then Nilus Cataractes more vaste and deepe. To the wilde Land beneath to make a shade, A Mountaine lifteth vp his crested Head: His Lockes are yce-sheekles, his Browes are Snow, Yet, from his burning Bowelles deepe below, Cometes, farre-flaming Pyramides are driuen And pitchie Meteores, to the Cope of Heauen. No Summer heere the loulie Grasse forth bringes, Nor Trees, no, not the deadlie Cypresse springes. Caue-louing Eccho Daughter of the Aire, By humane voyce was neuer wakned heere: In stead of nights blake Birdes, and plaintfull Owle, Infernall Furies heere doe yell and howle. A Mouth yawnes in this Hight so blacke obscure With vapours, that no eye it can endure: Great Ætnas Cauernes neuer yet did make Such sable dampes, though they bee hideous blacke, Sterne Horroures heere eternallie doe dwell, And this Gulfe destine for a Gate to Hell. Forth from this place of dread (Earth to appall) Three Furies rushed at the Angels call. One with long Tresses doth her Visage maske, Her Temples clouding in a horrid Caske, Her right Hand swinges a Brandon in the Aire, Which Flames and Terrour hurleth euery where; Ponderous with Darts, her left doth beare a Shield, Where Gorgones Head lookes grimme in sable Field: Her eyes blaze Fire and Blood, each haire stilles Blood, Blood trilles from either pappe, and where shee stood Bloods liquid Corrall sprang her feete beneath, Where shee doth streach her Arme is Blood &amp; Death. Her stygian Head no sooner shee vpreares, When Earth of Swords Helmes Lances straight appeares To bee deliuered, and from out her Wombe In Flame-wing'd Thunderes Artellerie doth come, Floodes siluer streames doe take a blushing Dye, The Plaines with breathlesse Bodies buried lye; Rage, Wronge, Rapte, Sacriledge doe her attend, Feare, Discorde, Wracke, &amp; Woes which haue none end: Towne is by Towne, and Prince by Prince with-stood, Earth turnes an hideous Shambles a Lake of Blood. The next with Eyes, sunke hollow in her Braines, Lane face, snarl'd haire, with blacke and emptie Veines, Her dry'd-vp Bones scarce couered with her Skinne, Bewraying that strange structure built within, Thigh-Bellilesse, most gastlie to the sight, A wasted Skeliton resembleth right. Where shee doeth roame in Aire faint doe the Birdes, Yawne doe Earths ruthlesse brood &amp; harmelesse Heards, The Woods wilde Forragers doe howle and roare, The humid Swimmers dye along the shoare; In Townes, the liuing doe the dead vp-eate, Then dye themselues, Alas! and wanting meate, Mothers not spare the Birth of their owne Wombes, But turne those Nestes of life to fatall Tombes. Last did a saffron-colour'd Hagge come out, With vncomb'd Haire, Browes banded all about With duskie cloudes, in ragged Mantle cled, Her breath with stinking Fumes the Aire be-spred, In either Hand shee held a Whip, whose Wyres, Still'd poyson, blaz'd with phlegethontall Fyres. (Relentlesse) Shee each state, sex, age defiles, Earth streames with goares, burnes with inuenom'd Biles; Where Shee repaires, Townes doe in Desartes turne, The liuing haue no pause the dead to mourne, The friend (Ah!) dares not locke the dying Eyes Of his belou'd, the Wyfe the Husband flies; Men Basiliskes to men proue, and by Breath, Then Lead or Steale, bring worse and swifter Death: No Cypresse, Obsequies, no Tombe they haue, The sad Heauen mostlie serues them for a Graue. These ouer Earth tumultuouslie doe runne, South, North, from rising to the setting Sunne; They some time parte, yet than the windes more fleete, Forth-with together in one place they meete. Great Quinzai yee it know, Susanias pride, And you Where statelie Tibers streames doe glide, Memphis, Parthenopè yee too it know, And where Euripus seuen-folde Tyde doth flow: Yee know it Empresses on Tames, Rosne, Seine, And yee faire Queenes by Tagus Danube Reine. Though they doe scoure the Earth, roame farre &amp; large, Not thus content the Angels leaue their Charge: Wee of her wracke these slender Signes may name, By greater they the Iudgement doe proclame. This Centers Center with a mightie Blow One bruiseth, whose crackt Concaues lowder low, And rumbel, than if all the Artellerie On Earth discharg'd at once were in the Skie; Her Surface shakes, her Mountaines in the Maine Turne topsiturnie, of Heights making plaine: Townes them ingulfe, and late where Towres did stand, Now nought remaineth but a waste of Sand. With turning Eddyes Seas sinke vnder Ground, And in their floting Depthes are Valleyes found; Late where with foamie Crestes waues tilted waues, Now fishie Bottomes shine and mossie Caues. The Mariner castes an amazed eye On his wing'd Firres, which bedded hee findes lye, Yet can hee see no Shore; but whilst hee thinkes, What hideous Creuesse that hudge Current drinkes, The Streames rush backe againe with storming Tyde, And now his Shippes on cristall mountaines glyde; Till they bee hurl'd farre beyond Seas and Hope, And setle on some Hill or Palace Tope: Or by triumphant Surges ouer-driuen, Show Earth their Entrailles and their Keeles the Heauen. Skies clowdie Tables some doe paint, with Fights Of armed Squadrones, justling Steedes and Knights, With shining Crosses, Iudge, and saphire Throne; Arraigned Criminelles to howle and groane, And plaintes send forth are heard: New-worlds seeme shine, With other Sunnes and Moones, false Starres decline, And diue in Seas; red Comets warme the Aire, And blaze, as other Worlds were judged there. Others the heauenlie Bodies doe displace, Make Sunne his Sisters stranger Steppes to trace; Beyond the course of Spheares hee driues his Coach, And neare the cold Arcturus doth approach; The Scythian amaz'd is at such Beames, The Mauritanian to see ycie Streames; The Shadow which ere-while turn'd to the West, Now wheeles about, then reeleth to the East: New starres aboue the eight Heauen sparkle cleare, Mars chopes with Saturne, Ioue claimes Marses spheare, Shrunke nearer Earth, all blackned now and Broone, In Maske of weeping Cloudes appeares the Moone. There are noe Seasons, Autumne, Summer, Spring, Are all sterne Winter, and no birth forth bring: Red turnes the Skies blew Curtaine o're this Globe, As to propine the Iudge with purple Robe. At first (entraunc'd) with sad and curious Eyes Earths Pilgrimes stare on those strange Prodigies: The Starre-gazer this Round findes truely moue In partes and whole, yet by no Skill can proue The Firmaments stay'd firmenesse. They which dreame An euerlastingnesse in worlds vaste Frame, Thinke well some Region where they dwell may wracke, But that the whole nor Time nor Force can shake; Yet (franticke) muse to see Heauens statly Lights, Like Drunkards, waylesse reele amidst their Heights. Such as doe Nationes gouerne, and Command Vastes of the Sea and Emperies of Land, Repine to see their Countries ouer-throwne, And find no Foe their Furie to make knowne: Alas (say they) what bootes our toyles and Paines, Of Care on earth is this the furthest Gaines? No Richesse now can bribe our angrye Fate, O no! to blaste our Pride the Heauenes do threate: In dust now must our Greatnesse buried lye, Yet is it comfort with the World to dye. As more and more the warning Signes encrease, Wild dread depriues lost Adames Race of Peace; From out their Grandame Earth They faine would flie, But whither know not, Heauens are farre and hie; Each would bewaile and mourne his owne Distresse, But publicke Cryes doe priuate Teares suppresse, Lamentes plaintes shreekes of woe disturbe all Eares, And Feare is equall to the Paine it feares. Amidst this Masse of Crueltie and Slights, This Galley full of God-despising Wights, This Iaile of Sinne and Shame, this filthie Stage Where all act folly miserie and rage; Amidst those Throngs of old prepar'd for Hell, Those Numbers which no Archimede can tell, A silly Crue did lurke, a harmelesse Rout Wandring the Earth, which God had chosen out To liue with Him (Few Roses which did blow Among those Weedes Earthes Garden ouer-grow; A deaw of Gold still'd on Earths sandy Mine, Small Diamondes in Worlds rough Rocks which shine) By purple Tyrants which persued and chas'd, Liu'd Recluses, in lonlie Islands plac'd; Or did the Mountaines haunte, and Forests wild, Which they than Townes more harmelesse found and mild: Where many an Hymne they to their Makers praise Teacht Groues and Rocks, which did resound their Layes. Nor Sword nor Famine nor Plague poisoning Aire, Nor Prodigies appearing euery where, Nor all the sad Disorder of this All, Could this small handfull of the World appall; But as the Flowre, which during winters Cold Runnes to the Roote, and lurkes in Sap vp-rol'd, So soone as the great Planet of the Yeare Beginnes the Twinnes deare Mansion to cleare, Liftes vp its fragrant Head, and to the Field A Spring of Beauty and Delight doth yeeld: So at those Signes and Apparitiones strange Their thoughts lookes gestures did beginne to change, Ioy makes their Hands to clap, their Hearts to dance, In Voice turnes Musicke in their Eyes doth glance. What can (say They) these Changes else portend Of this great Frame saue the approaching End? Past are the Signes, all is perform'd of old Which the Almighties Heraulds vs fore-told. Heauen now no longer shall of Gods great Power A turning Temple be, but fixed Tower, Burne shall this mortall Masse amidst the Aire, Of diuine Iustice turn'd a Trophee faire; Neare is the last of Dayes, whose light enbalmes Past Griefes, and all our stormy Cares becalmes. O happy Day! O chearefull holy Day! Which Nights sad Sables shall not take away! Farewell Complaintes, and yee yet doubtfull Thought, Crown now your Hopes with comforts long time sought; Wypt from our Eyes now shall be euerie Teare, Sighes stopt; since our Saluation is so neare. What long wee long'd for, God at last hath giuen Earths chosen Bands to ioyne with those of Heauen; Now noble Soules a Guerdon just shall finde, And Rest and Glorie bee in one combinde, Now, more than in a Mirrour, by these Eyne Euen Face to face our Maker shall be seene; O Welcome Wonder of the Soule and Sight! O Welcome Obiect of all true Delight! Thy Triumphes and Returne wee did expect, Of all past Toyles to reape the deare Effect: Since thou art iust, performe thy holy Word, O come still hop'd for, come long Wish'd for Lord. While thus They pray, the Heauens in Flames appeare, As if they shew Fires elementall Spheare, The Earth seemes in the Sunne, the Welken gone, Wonder all hushes; straight the Aire doth grone With Trumpets, which thrice-lowder Sounds doe yeeld Than deafening Thunders in the airie Field. Created Nature at the Clangor quakes, Immur'd with Flames Earth in a Palsey Shakes, And from her wombe the Dust in seuerall Heapes Takes life, and mustereth into humane Shapes: Hell burstes, and the foule prisoners there bound Come howling to the Day, with Serpentes crown'd. Milliones of Angels in the loftie Hight, Cled in pure Gold and the Electar bright, Ushering the way still where the Iudge should moue, In radiant Raine-bowes vaulte the Skies aboue; Which quickly open, like a Curtaine driuen, And beaming Glorie show the King of Heaven. What Persian Prince, Assirian most renown'd, What Scythian with conquering Squadrones Crown'd, Entring a breached Citie, where conspire Fire to drie Blood, and Blood to quench out Fire; Where cutted Carcasses quicke Members reele, And by their ruine blunte the reeking Steele, Resembleth now the euer-liuing King? What Face of Troy which doth with yelling ring, And grecian Flames transported in the aire, What dreadfull Spectacle of Carthage faire? What Picture of rich Corinthes tragicke wracke, Or of Numantia the hideous sacke, Or These together showne, the Image, Face Can represent of Earth, and plaintfull case; Which must lye smoaking in the Worlds vast Wombe, And to it Selfe both fewell be and Tombe? Neare to that sweet and odoriferous Clime, Where the all-cheering Emperour of Tyme Makes spring the Casia, Narde, and fragrant Balmes, And euerie Hill, and Collin Crownes with Palmes; Where Incense sweats, where weeps the precious Mirre, And Cedars ouer-tope the Pine and Firre; Neare where the aged Phœnix, ty'rd of Breath Doth build her Nest, and takes new life in Death: A Valley into wide and open Feildes Farre it extendeth,The rest is desired. A CYPRESSE GROVE: BY W. D. On the Report of the Death of the Author. If that were true, which whispered is by Fame, That Damons light no more on Earth doth burne, His Patron Phœbus physicke would disclame, And cloath'd in clowds as earst for Phaeton mourne? Yea, Fame by this had got so deepe a Wound, That scarce Shee could haue power to tell his Death, Her Wings cutte short; who could her Trumpet sound, Whose Blaze of late was nurc't but by His breath? That Spirit of His which most with mine was free, By mutuall trafficke enterchanging Store, If chac'd from Him it would haue com'd to mee, Where it so oft familiare was before. Some secret Griefe distempering first my Minde, Had (though not knowing) made mee feele this losse: A Sympathie had so our Soules combind, That such a parting both at once would tosse. Though such Reportes to others terrour giue, Thy heauenly Vertues who did neuer spie, I know, Thou, that canst make the dead to liue, Immortall art, and needes not feare to die. Sir William Alexander. To S. W. A. Though I haue twice beene at the Doores of Death, And twice found shoote those Gates which euer mourne, This but a lightning is, Truce tane to Breath, For late borne Sorrowes augure fleete returne. Amidst thy sacred Cares, and courtlie Toyles, Alexis, when thou shalt heare wandring Fame Tell, Death hath triumph'd o're my mortall Spoyles, And that on Earth I am but a sad Name; If thou e're helde mee deare, by all our Loue, By all that Blisse, those Ioyes Heauen heere vs gaue, I conjure Thee, and by the Maides of Ioue, To graue this short Remembrance on my Graue. Heere Damon lyes, whose Songes did some-time grace The murmuring Eske, may Roses shade the place. To the Memorie of the most excellent Ladie, Iane Countesse of Perth. This Beautie, which pale Death in Dust did turne, And clos'd so soone within a Coffin sad, Did passe like Lightning, like to Thunder burne; So little Life so much of Worth it had! Heauens but to show their Might heere made it shine, And when admir'd, then in the Worlds Disdaine (O Teares, O Griefe!) did call it backe againe, Lest Earth should vaunt Shee kept what was Diuine. What can wee hope for more? what more enjoy? Sith fairest Thinges thus soonest haue their End; And, as on Bodies shadowes doe attend, Sith all our Blisse is follow'd with Annoy? Shee is not dead, Shee liues where shee did loue, Her Memorie on Earth, Her Soule aboue. To the obsequies of the blessed Prince, Iames, King of great Britaine. Let holie Dauid, Salomon the Wise, That King, Whose Brest Ægeria did inflame, Augustus, Helenes Sonne, Great in all Eyes, Doe Homage low to thy mausolean Frame; And bow before thy Laurell Anadeame Let all Those sacred Swannes, which to the Skies By neuer-dying Layes haue rais'd their Name, From North to South, where Sunne doth set and rise. Religion, orphan'd, waileth o're thine Vrne, Out Iustice weepes her Eyes, now truely Blind; In Niobèes the remnant Vertues turne: Fame, but to blaze thy Glories, liues behind. The World, which late was Golden by thy Breath, Is Iron turn'd, and horrid by thy Death. FINIS. The Entertainment of King Charles. [i] [The heavens have heard our vowes, our just desires] The heavens have heard our vowes, our just desires Obtained are, no higher now aspires Our wishing thoughts, since to his native clime The flower of Princes, honour of his time, Encheering all our Dales, Hills, Forrests, streames, (As Phœbus doth the Summer with his beames) Is come, and radiant to us in his traine The golden age and vertues brings againe; Prince so much longed for, how thou becalm'st Mindes easelesse anguish, every care embalm'st With the sweet odours of thy presence! now In swelling tydes joyes every where doe flow By thine approach, and that the world may see What unthought wonders doe attend on thee, This Kingdomes Angel I, who since that day That ruthlesse Fate thy Parent reft away, And made a Starre, appear'd not any where, To gratulate thy comming, saving here. Haile Princes Phœnix, Monarch of all hearts, Soveraigne of love and justice, who imparts More then thou canst receive; to thee this Crowne Is due by birth; but more, it is thine owne By just desert; and ere another brow Then thine should reach the same, my flood[s] should flow With hot vermilian gore, and every Plaine Levell the hills with Carcases of slaine, This Ile become a red Sea: Now how sweet Is it to me, when love and Lawes thus meet To girt thy Temples with this Diadem, My nurselings sacred feare, and dearest Gemme. No Roman, Saxon, Pict by sad alarmes Could this acquire and keepe; the heavens in armes From us repelld all perills, nor by warres Ought here was wonne but gaping wounds and scarres, Our Lions Clymaterick now is past, And crown'd with Bayes, he rampant's free at last. Heere are no Serean fleeces, Peru gold, Auroras gemmes, nor wares by Tyrians sold; Townes swell not here with Babilonian walles, Nor Nero's sky-resembling gold-seel'd halles, Nor Memphis spires, nor Quinzayes arched frames, Captiving Seas, and giving Lands their names: Faith (milke-white Faith) of old belov'd so well, Yet in this corner of the World doth dwell With her pure Sisters, Truth, Simplicitie; Heere banish'd Honour beares them company, A Mars-adorning brood is heere, their wealth Sound mindes, and bodies of as sound a health: Walles heere are men, who fence their Cities more Then Neptune when he doth in mountaines roare, Doth guard this Isle, or all those Forts and Towres Amphions Harpe rais'd about Thebes bowres, Heavens arch is oft their roofe, the pleasant shed Of Oake and Plaine oft serves them for a bed. To suffer want, soft pleasure to despise, Runne over panting Mountaines crown'd with Ice, Rivers orecome, the wastest Lakes appall (Being to themselves, Oares, Steerers, ship and all) Is their renowne; a brave all-daring race Couragious, prudent, doth this Climate grace: Yet the firme Base on which their glory stands, In peace true hearts, in warres is valiant hands, Which here (great King) they offer up to thee, Thy worth respecting as thy pedegree: Though much it be to come of Princely stemme, More is it to deserve a Diadem. Vouchsafe blest people, ravisht here with me, To thinke my thoughts, and see what I doe see, A Prince all gracious, affable, divine, Meeke, wise, just, valiant, whose radiant shine Of vertues (like the Starres about the Pole Guilding the night) enlightneth every soule, Your Scepter swayes, a Prince borne in this age To guard the innocents from Tyrants rage, To make Peace prosper, Iustice to reflowre, In desert hamlet as in Lordly bowre; A Prince, that though of none he stand in awe, Yet first subjects himselfe to his owne law, Who joyes in good, and still, as right directs His greatnesse measures by his good effects, His Peoples pedestall, who rising high To grace this throne makes Scotlands name to flie On Halcyons wings (her glory which restores) Beyond the Ocean to Columbus shores, Gods sacred picture in this man adore, Honour his valour, zeale, his piety more, High value what ye hold, him deep ingrave In your hearts heart, from whom all good ye have: For as Moones splendor from her brother springs, The peoples welfare streameth from their Kings. Since your loves object doth immortall prove, O love this Prince with an eternall love, Pray that those Crownes his Ancestors did weare, His temples long (more orient) may beare, That good he reach by sweetnesse of his sway, That even his shadow may the bad affray, That heaven on him what he desires bestow, That still the glory of his greatnesse grow, That your begunne felicities may last, That no Orion doe with stormes them blast, That victory his brave exployts attend, East, West, or South doe he his Forces bend, Till his great deeds all former deeds surmount, And quaile the Nimbrot of the Hellespont; That when his well-spent care all care becalmes, He may in peace sleepe in a shade of Palmes; And rearing up faire Trophees, that heavens may Extend his life to worlds extreamest day. [ii] Endymion. Rows'd from the Latmian Cave, where many years That Empresse of the lowest of the Sphæres, Who cheeres the night, and kept me hid, apart From mortall wights, to ease her love-sicke heart, As young as when she did me first inclose, As fresh in beauty as the Maying rose, Endymion; that whilome kept my Flockes Vpon Ionas flowry hills and rockes, And warbling sweet layes to my Cynthea's beames, Out-sang the Swannets of Meanders streames; To whom (for Guerdon) she heavens secret barres Made open, taught the paths and powers of Starres; By this deare Ladies strict commandement To celebrate this day I here am sent: But whether is this heaven, which starres doe crowne, Or are heavens flaming splendors here come downe, To beautify this neather world with me? Such state and glory did e're Shepheard see? My wits my sense mistrust, and stay amaz'd, No eye on fairer objects ever gaz'd, Sure this is heaven, for every wandring starre, Forsaking those great orbes where whirl'd they are, All dismall sad aspects abandoning, Are here assembled to greet some darling; Nor is it strange if they heavens hight neglect, Vnwonted worth produceth like effect, Then this it is, thy presence (royall youth) Hath brought them here within an Azymuth, To tell by me (their Herauld) comming things, And what each Fate to her sterne distaffe sings; Heavens volume to unclaspe, wast pages spread, Mysterious golden cyphers cleere to reade, Heare then the augur of the future dayes And all the starry Senate of the Sayes; For what is firme decreed in heaven above In vaine on earth strive mortalls to improve. [iii] Saturne. To faire hopes to give reines now is it time, And soare as high as just desires may climbe; O Halcyonean, cleere, and happy day, From sorry wights let sorrow flie away, And vexe Antarticke climes, great Britaines woes Evanish, joy now in her Zenith glowes, The old Leucadian Syth-bearing Sire (Though cold) for thee feeles flames of sweet desire, And many lusters at a perfect height Shall keep thy Scepters majestie, as bright And strong in power and glory every way, As when thy peerelesse Parent did it sway, Nere turning wrinkled in times endlesse length, But one in her first beauty, youthfull strength, Like thy rare mind, which stedfast as the Pole Still fixed stands, however Sphæres doe role; More, to inhaunce thy favours, this thy raigne His age of gold he shall restore againe, Love, Iustice, Honour, Innocence renew, Mens spirits with white simplicity indue, Make all to live in plenties ceaselesse store With equall shares, not wishing to have more; Then shall not cold the Plow-mens hopes beguile, On earth shall skie with lovely glances smile, Vntill'd, which shall each flower and hearbe bring forth, And with faire gardens make of equall worth; Life (long) shall not be thrall'd to mortall dates, Thus heavens decree, so have ordain'd the Fates. [iv] Iove. Delight of heaven, sole honour of the earth, Iove (courting thine ascendant) at thy birth Proclaimed thee a King, and made it true, That Emperies should to thy worth be due, He gave thee what was good, and what was great, What did belong to love, and what to state, Rare gifts whose ardors turne the hearts of all, Like tunder when flint attomes on it fall; The Tramontane which thy faire course directs, Thy counsells shall approve by their effects; Iustice kept low by grants, and wrongs, and jarres, Thou shalt relieve, and crowne with glistering starres, Whom nought save law of force could keepe in awe Thou shalt turne Clients to the force of law, Thou armes shalt brandish for thine owne defence, Wrongs to repell, and guard weake innocence, Which to thy last effort thou shalt uphold, As Oake the Ivy which it doth infold; All overcome, at last thy selfe orecome, Thou shalt make passion yield to reasons doome: For smiles of fortune shall not raise thy mind, Nor dismall most disasters turne declin'd, True Honour shall reside within thy Court, Sobrietie, and Truth there still resort, Keepe promis'd faith thou shalt, Supercheries Detest, and beagling Marmosets despise, Thou, others to make rich, shalt not make poore Thy selfe, but give that thou mayst still give more; Thou shalt no Paranymph raise to high place, For frizl'd locks, quaint pace, or painted face; On gorgeous rayments, womanising toyes, The workes of wormes, and what a Moth destroyes, The Maze of fooles, thou shalt no treasure spend, Thy charge to immortality shall tend, Raise Pallaces, and Temples vaulted high, Rivers ore arch, of hospitality, Of Sciences the ruin'd Innes restore, With walls and ports incircle Neptunes shore, To new found worlds thy Fleets make hold their course, And find of Canada the unknowne Sourse, People those Lands which passe Arabian fields In fragrant Wood and Muske which Zephyre yields; Thou fear'd of none, shalt not thy people feare, Thy peoples love thy greatnesse shall up-reare, Still rigour shall not shine, and mercy lower, What love can doe thou shalt not doe by power, New and vast taxes thou shalt not extort, Load heavy those thy bounty should support, By harmlesse Iustice graciously reforme, Delighting more in calme then roaring storme, Thou shalt governe in peace as did thy Sire, Keepe, save thine owne, and kingdomes new acquire, Beyond Alcides Pillars, and those bounds Where Alexanders fame till now resounds, Till thou the greatest be among the Greats; Thus heavens ordaine, so doe decree the Faits. [v] Mars. Sonne of the Lyon, thou of loathsome bands Shalt free the earth, and what e're thee withstands Thy noble pawes shall teare, the God of Thrace Shall be the second, and before thy face, To Truth and Iustice, whilst thou Trophees reares, Armies shall fall dismayd with Pannick feares, As when Aurora in skies azure lists Makes shaddowes vanish, doth disperse the mists, And in a twinckling with her opall light, Nights horrours checketh, putteth starres to flight, More to inflame thee to this noble taske, To thee he here resignes his Sword and Caske, A wall of flying Castles, armed Pines Shall bridge thy sea, like heaven with steele that shines, To aide earths tennants by foule yoakes opprest, And fill with feares the great King of the West: To thee already Victory displayes Her garlands twin'd with Olive, Oake, and Bayes, Thy triumphs finish shall all old debates; Thus Heavens decree, so have ordain'd the Fates. [vi] Sunne. Wealth, Wisedome, Glory, Pleasure, stoutest hearts, Religion, Lawes, Hyperion imparts To thy just Raigne, which shall farre farre surpasse, Of Emperours, Kings, the best that ever was; Looke how hee dims the starres; thy glories rayes, So darken shall the lustre of these dayes: For in faire vertues Zodiacke thou shalt runne, And in the heaven of worthies be the Sunne. No more contemn'd shall haplesse Learning lie; The maids of Pindus shall be raysed high; For Bay and Ivie which their browes enroll'd, Thou shalt them decke with gems and shining gold; Thou open shalt Parnassus Cristall gates, Thus heavens ordaine, so doe decree the Fates. [vii] Venus. The Acidalian Queene amidst the Bayes Shall twine her mirtles, grant thee pleasant dayes; She did make cleare thy house, and with her light Of cheerelesse starres, put backe the dismall spight. Thy Hymenean bed faire brood shall grace, Which on the earth continue shall their race, While Floras treasure shall the Meads endeare, While sweete Pomona Rose-cheek't fruits shall beare, While Phœbes beames her brothers emulates: Thus Heavens decree, so have ordain'd the Fates. [viii] Mercury. Great Atlas Nephew, shall the workes of peace, (The workes of plenty) Tillage, Trades encrease, And Arts in times gulfes lost againe restore, To their Perfection; nay, find many more, More perfect artists, Ciclopes in their forge Shall mould those brasen Tiphones, which disgorge From their hard bowels mettall, flame and smoake, Mufling the ayre up in a sable cloake: The Sea shrinkes at the blow, shake doth the ground, The worlds West corners doth the sound rebound, The Stygian Porter leaveth off to barke, Black Ioue appall'd doth shrow'd him in the darke; Many a Typhis in adventures lost By new found skill shall many mayden coast, With thy sayle-winged Argoses find out, Which like the Sunne shall runne the earth about, And farre beyond his pathes score wavie wayes, To Cathayes Lands by Hyperborean Seas, Hee shall endue thee both in peace and warre, With Wisedome, which then Strength is better farre, Wealth, Honour, Armes, and Arts shall grace thy states: Thus Heavens ordaine, so doe decree the Fates. [ix] The Moone. O how the faire Queene with the golden maids, The Sunne of night, thy happy fortunes aids, Though turban'd Princes for a badge her weare, To them shee wain'd, to thee would full appeare; Her Hand-maid Thetis daily walkes the round About the Delos that no force it wound, Then when thou left it and abroad did stray (Deare Pilgrim) shee did straw with flowers the way, And turning forraine force and counsell vaine, Thy Guard and Guid return'd thee home againe; To thee she Kingdomes, Yeares, Blisse did divine, Quailing Medusas grim Snakes with her shine, Beneath thee raigne Discord (fell mischiefes forge, The bane of peoples, state and kingdomes scourge) Pale Envie (with the Cockatrices eye, Which seeing kils, but seene doth forthwith dye:) Malice, Deceit, Rebellion, Impudence Beyond the Garamants shall packe them hence, With every Monster that thy glory hates, Thus Heavens decree, so haue ordayn'd the Fates. [x] Endymion. That heretofore to thy heroicke mind Haps, (hopes not answer'd as they were design'd:) O doe not thinke it strange, times were not come, And these faire starres had not pronounc'd their doome; The destinies did on that day attend, When to this Northren Region thou should lend Thy cheering presence, and charg'd with Renowne, Set on thy browes the Caledonian Crowne; Thy vertues now thy just desire shall grace, Sterne Chance shall change, and to Desert give place; Let this be knowne to all the Fates admit To their grave Counsell, and to every Witt That spies Heavens inside; this let Sibilles know, And those mad Corybants which dance and glow On Dindimus high tops with franticke fire: Let this bee knowne to all Apollo's Quire, And people let it not be hid from you, What Mountaines noyse and Floods proclaime as true: Where ever fame abroad his prayse shall ring, All shall observe, and serve this blessed King. [xi] [At length we see those eyes] At length we see those eyes, which cheere both over earth and skies, Now ancient Caledon thy beauties highten, richest robes put on, and let young joyes to all thy parts arise. Here could thy Prince still stay, each moneth should turne in May, We need not starre nor Sunne, save him to lengthen dayes and joyes begunne, sorrow and night to farre climes hast away. Now Majestie and Love combin'd are from above, Prince never Scepter swayd lov'd subjects more, of subjects more obey'd, which may indure whilst heavens great orbs do move. Ioyes did ye alwayes last, lifes sparke ye soone would wast, Griefe followes sweet delight, as day is shaddowed by sable night, yet shall remembrance keep you still, when past. [xii] EPIGRAMME. [Illustrious Top-bough of Heroicke Stemme] Illustrious Top-bough of Heroicke Stemme, Whose head is crown'd with glories Anademe, My shallow Muse, not daring to draw neere Bright Phœbus burning flames in his careere; Yet knowing surely that Apollo shines Vpon the Dung-hill, as on golden Mines: And knowing this, the bounty of best Kings, To marke the giver, not the gifted things, Doth boldly venture in this pompous throng To greet thy greatnesse with a wel-come Song; And with the Pye doth Ave Cæsar sing, While graver wits doe greater Offrings bring. TO THE EXEQUIES OF THE HONOVRABLE, S?. Antonye Alexander, KNIGHT, &amp;c. A Pastorall Elegie. A Pastorall Elegie on the Death of S. A[ntonye] A[lexander.] In sweetest prime and blooming of his Age, Deare Alcon ravish'd from this mortall Stage, The Shepheards mourn'd as they him lov'd before: Among the Rout him Idmon did deplore, Idmon, who, whether Sun in East did rise Or dive in West, pour'd Torrents from his Eyes Of liquid Chrystall, under Hawthorne shade; At last to Trees and Rocks this plaint he made: Alcon, delight of heaven, desire of Earth, Off-spring of Phœbus, and the Muses birth, The Graces Darling, Adon of our Plaines, Flame of the fairest Nymphs the Earth sustaines, What Power of thee hath us bereft? What Fate By thy untimely fall would ruinate Our hopes? O Death! what treasure in one houre Hast thou dispersed? How dost thou devoure What we on earth hold dearest? All things good, Too envious Heavens, how blast ye in the Bud? The Corne the greedy Reapers cut not down Before the Fields with golden Eares it crown, Nor doth the verdant Fruits the Gardener pull, But thou art cropt before thy yeares were full. With thee (sweet youth) the Glories of our Fields Vanish away, and what contentments yields; The Lakes their silver look, the woods their shades, The Springs their Christall want, their Verdure Meads, The yeares their early seasons, cheerfull Dayes; Hills gloomy stand now desolate of Rayes, Their amorous whispers Zephires not us bring, Nor do Aires Quiresters salute the Spring; The freezing winds our Gardens do defloure. Ah, Destinies! and you whom Skies embow'r, To his faire Spoiles his Spright againe yet give, And like another Phœnix make him live. The Herbs, though cut, sprout fragrant from their stems, And make with Crimson blush our Anadems; The Sun when in the West he doth decline, Heavens brightest Tapers at his Funeralls shine; His Face, when washt in the Atlantick Seas, Revives, and cheeres the Welkin with new Raies: Why should not he, since of more pure a Frame, Returne to us againe, and be the same? But wretch, what wish I? To the winds I send These Plaints and Prayers, Destines cannot lend Thee more of Time, nor Heavens consent will thus Thou leave their starry World to dwell with us; Yet shall they not thee keep amidst their Spheares Without these lamentations and Teares. Thou wast all Vertue, Courtesie, and Worth, And as Suns light is in the Moon set forth, Worlds supreame Excellence in thee did shine; Nor, though eclipsed now, shalt thou decline, But in our Memories live, while Dolphins streames Shall haunt, whilst Eaglets stare on Titans beames, Whilst Swans upon their Christall Tombes shall sing, Whilst Violets with Purple paint the Spring. A gentler Shepheard Flocks did never feed On Albions Hills, nor sung to oaten Reed: While what she found in Thee my Muse would blaze, Griefe doth distract Her, and cut short thy Praise. How oft have we, inviron'd by the Throng Of tedious Swaines, the cooler shades among, Contemn'd Earths glow-worme Greatnesse, and the Chace Of Fortune scorn'd, deeming it disgrace To court unconstancy? How oft have we Some Chloris Name graven in each Virgin Tree, And finding Favours fading, the next Day What we had carv'd we did deface away? Woefull Remembrance! Nor Time nor Place Of thy abodement shadows any Trace, But there to me Thou shin'st: late glad Desires, And ye once Roses, how are ye turned Bryers? Contentments passed, and of Pleasures Chiefe, Now are ye frightfull Horrours, Hells of Griefe. When from thy native Soyle Love had Thee driven, (Thy safe returne Prefigurating) a Heaven Of flattering Hopes did in my Fancy move, Then little dreaming it should Atomes prove. These Groves preserve will I, these loved Woods, These Orchards rich with Fruits, with Fish these flouds: My Alcon will returne, and once againe His chosen Exiles he will entertaine; The populous City holds him, amongst Harmes Of some fierce Cyclops, Circe's stronger Charmes. These Bankes (said I) he visit will and Streames, These silent shades ne're kist by courting Beames; Far, far off I will meet him, and I first Shall him approaching know, and first be blest With his Aspect; I first shall heare his voice, Him find the same he parted, and rejoyce To learne his passed Perills, know the Sports Of forraine Shepheards, Fawns, and Fairy Courts. No pleasure to the Fields; an happy State The Swaines enjoy, secure from what they hate: Free of proud Cares they innocently spend The Day, nor do black Thoughts their ease offend; Wise Natures Darlings they live in the World, Perplexing not themselves how it is hurld. These Hillocks Phœbus loves, Ceres these Plaines, These Shades the Sylvans, and here Pales straines Milke in the Pailes, the Maids which haunt the Springs Daunce on these Pastures, here Amintas sings; Hesperian Gardens, Tempe's shades are here, Or what the Easterne Inde, and West hold deare. Come then, deare Youth, the Wood-nymphs twine thee Boughs With Rose and Lilly, to impale thy Brows. Thus ignorant, I mus'd, not conscious yet Of what by Death was done, and ruthlesse Fate: Amidst these Trances Fame thy losse doth sound, And through my Eares gives to my Heart a wound; With stretched-out Armes I sought thee to embrace, But clasp'd (amaz'd) a Coffin in thy Place; A Coffin! of our Joyes which had the Trust, Which told that thou was come, but chang'd in Dust. Scarce, even when felt, could I believe this wrake, Nor that thy Tyme and Glory Heavens would break. Now since I cannot see my Alcons Face, And finde nor Vowes nor Prayers to have place With guiltie Starres, this Mountaine shall become To mee a sacred Altar, and a Tombe To famous Alcon: heere, as Dayes, Months, Yeares Do circling glide, I sacrifice will teares, Heere spend my remnant Tyme, exil'd from Mirth Till Death in end turne Monarch of my Earth. Sheepheards on Forth, and yee by Doven Rockes Which use to sing and sport, and keep your Flockes, Pay Tribute heere of Teares; yee never had To aggravate your Moanes a cause more sad; And to their sorrowes hither bring your Mandes Charged with sweetest flowres, and with pure Handes, (Faire nymphes) the blushing Hyacinth and Rose Spred on the Place his Relicts doth enclose; Weave Garlands to his Memorie, and put Over his Hearse a Verse in Cypresse cut: “Vertue did die, Goodnesse but harme did give After the noble Alcon left to live, Friendship an Earth-quake suffer'd; loosing Him, Loves brightest Constellation turned Dim.” Madrigals, etc. Poem i. (Clorus) in this section is repeated in the section of commendatory poems at the beginning of this document. [ii] Son. Aye me, and am I now the Man whose Muse In happier Times was wont to laugh at Loue And those who suffred that blind Boy abuse The noble Gifts were giuen them from aboue? What Metamorphose strange is this I proue? My selfe now scarse I finde my selfe to be, And thinkes no Fable Circes Tyrannie, And all the Tales are told of changed Iove, Vertue hath faire with her Philosophie My Mind vnto a better Course to moue, Reason may chide her full, and oft reproue Affections Power, but what is that to me Who euer thinkes, and neuer thinkes on Ought But that bright Cherubine that thralles my Thought. [iii] MAD. Trees happier farre then I, Which haue the Grace to heaue your Heads so hie, And ouer-looke those Plaines: Grow till your Branches kisse that lofty Skie Which her (sweet Her) containes. There make her know mine endlesse Loue, and Paines, And how these Teares which from mine Eyes doe fall, Helpt you to rise so Tall: Her tell, as once I for her sake lou'd Breath, So for her sake I now court lingring Death. [iv] To Sleepe. How comes it Sleepe, that thou Euen kisses me affords Of her (deare her) so farre who's absent now? How did I heare those Words, Which Rockes might moue, and moue the Pines to bow? Aye mee before halfe Daye Why didst thou steale away? Returne, I thine for euer will remaine, And onlie bring with thee that Guest againe. [v] An Almanacke. This strange Ecclipse one sayes Strange Wonders doth fortell, But yee whose Wyfes excell, And loue to count their Praise, Shut all your gates, your Hedges Plant with Thornes, The Sunne menac'd the World this Time with Hornes. [vi] A Chaine of Gold. Are not those Lockes of Gold Sufficient Chaines the wildest Harts to hold? Is not that Yuorie Hand A Diamantine Band, Most sure to keepe the most vntamed Minde, But yee must others finde? O yes: why is that Golden One then borne Thus free in Chaines (perhaps) Loues Chaines to scorne. [vii] EPITAPH. The Bawd of Iustice, he who Lawes controll'd, And made them fawne, and frowne as he got gold, That Proteus of our State, whose Hart and Mouth Were farther distant than is North from South, That Cormorant who made himselfe so grosse On Peoples Ruine, and the Princes Losse, Is gone to and though he here did euill, He meanes below to prooue an honest Deuill. [viii] A TRANSLATION. [Fierce Robbers were of old] Fierce Robbers were of old Exild the Champian Ground, From Hamlets chas'd, in Citties kill'd or bound, And onely Woods, Caues, Mountaines, did them hold: But now (when all is sold) Woods, Mountaines, Caues, to good Men be refudge, And doe the Guiltlesse lodge, And cled in Purple Gownes The greatest Theeues command within the Townes. [ix] [Come Citizens erect to Death an Alter] Come Citizens erect to Death an Alter, That sau'd to you Axe, Fuell, Timber, Halter. [x] Proteus of Marble. This is no worke of Stone, Though breathlesse, cold it seeme and sense hath none, But that false God which keepes The monstruous people of the raging Deepes: Now that he doth not change his Shape this while, Is't not thus constant more you to beguile? [xi] The Statue of VENVS sleeping. Passenger vexe not thy Minde To make mee mine Eyes vnfold, For when thou them doest behold, Thine perhaps they will make blinde. [xii] LAVRA to PETRARCH. I rather loue a Youth and childish Rime, Then thee whose Verse and Head be wise through time. [xiii] A Louers Prayer. Neare to a Christall Spring, With Thirst and Heat opprest, Narcissa faire doth rest, Trees pleasant Trees which those green plaines forth bring Now interlace your trembling Tops aboue And make a Canopie vnto my Loue, So in Heauens highest House when Sunne appeares, Aurora may you cherish with her Teares. [xiv] For Dorvs. Why Nais stand yee nice Like to a well wrought Stone, When Dorus would you kisse? Denie him not that blisse, He's but a Childe (old Men be Children twice) And euen a Toothlesse one: And when his Lips yours touch in that delight Yee need not feare he will those Cherries bite. [xv] Loue vagabonding. Sweet Nymphes if as yee straye Yee finde the froth-borne Goddesse of the Sea, All blubbred, pale, vndone, Who seekes her giddie Sone, That litle God of Loue, Whose golden shafts your chastest Bosomes proue: Who leauing all the Heauens hath runne away: If shee to him him findes will ought impart Her tell he Nightlie lodgeth in my Heart. [xvi] Phræne. Aonian Sisters helpe my Phrenes Praise to tell, Phrene hart of my hart with whom the Graces dwel, For I surcharged am so sore that I not know What first to praise of her, her Brest, or Necke of Snow, Her Cheeks with Roses spred, or her two Sun-like Eies, Her Teeth of brightest Pearle, her Lips where Svveetnes lies: But those do praise themselues, being to all Eyes set forth, That Muses yee need not to say ought of their Worth, Then her white sistring Papes essaye for to make knowne, But her white sistring Papes through smallest Vail are showne, Yet Shee hath some thing else more worthie then the rest Not seene, goe sing of that farre beneath her Brest Which mounts like fair Parnasse, where Pegasse wel doth run: Here Phræne stay'd my Muse ere shee had well begun. [xvii] Desired Death. Deare Life while as I touch These Corrall Ports of blisse, Which still themselues do kisse, And sweetly me inuite to do as much, All panting in my Lips, My Life my Heart doth leaue, No sense my Senses haue, And inward Powers doe find a strange Ecclipse, This Death so heauenly well Doth so me please, that I Would neuer longer seeke in sense to dwell, If that euen thus I only could but die. [xviii] Phœbe. If for to be alone and all the Night to wander Maids can proue chast, then chast is Phœbe without slander. Ansvver. Fool still to be alone, all Night in Heauen to wander, Wold make the wanton chast, then she's chast without slander. Commendatory Verses. i. To S? W. A. [Prefixed to “DOOMES-DAY,” by Sir William Alexander. Edinburgh, 1614, 4to.] Like Sophocles (the hearers in a trance) With Crimson Cothurne on a stately Stage If thou march forth (where all with pompe doth glance) To mone the Monarches of the Worlds first Age; Or if, like Phœbus, thou thy Selfe aduance, All bright with sacred Flames, known by Heau?s Badge, To make a Day, of Dayes which scornes the Rage, Whilst when they end it, what should come doth Scance; Thy Phœnix-Muse still wing'd with Wonders flies, Praise of our Brookes, Staine to old Pindus Springs, And who thee follow would, scarce with their Eyes Can reach the Spheare where thou most sweetlie sings. Though string'd with Starres Heau?s Orpheus Harpe enrolle, More worthy Thine to blaze about the Pole. William Drvmmond. ii. To the Author. Sonnet. [Prefixed to “The famous Historye of PENARDO AND LAISSA,” by Patrik Gordon. Dort, 1615, 8vo.] Come forth, Laissa, spred thy lockes of Gold, Show thy cheekes roses in their virgine Prime, And though no g?mes the decke which Indies hold, Yeild not vnto the fairest of thy tyme. No ceruse brought farre farre beyond the seas, Noe poisone lyke Cinabre Paints thy face, Let them haue that whose natiue hues displeas, Thow graceth nakednesse, it doth the grace. Thy Syre no pyick-purse is of others witt, Those Jewellis be his oune which the adorne; And though thow after greatter ones be borne, Thou mayst be bold euen midst the first to sitt, For whilst fair Iuliett, or the farie quene Doe liue with theirs, thy beautie shall be seene. M. William Drommond. iii. ON THE DEATH OF GODEFRID VANDER HAGEN. [Prefixed to G. Vander Hagen, “MISCELLANEA POEMATA.” Middelburgi, 1619, 4to.] Scarce I four Lusters had enjoyed Breath, When my Lifes Threid was cut by cruel Death; Few were my Yeares, so were my Sorrowes all, Long Dayes haue Drammes of sweet, but Pounds of Gall; And yet the fruites which my faire Spring did giue, Proue some may longer breath, not longer liue. That craggie Path which doth to Vertue lead, With steps of Honor I did stronglie tread; I made sweet Layes, and into Notes diuyne Out-sung Apollo and the Muses nyne. Forths sweetest Swannets did extolle my Verse, Forths sweetest Swannets now weepe o're my Hearse, For which I pardone Fates my date of Yeares; Kings may haue vaster Tombes, not dearer Teares. W. Drvmmond. iv. Of my Lord of Galloway his learned Commentary on the Reuelation. [Prefixed to “PATHMOS; OR A COMMENTARY ON THE REVELATION OF SAINT IOHN,” by William Cowper, Bishop of Galloway. London, 1619, 4to.] To this admir'd Discouerer giue place, Yee who first tam'd the Sea, the Windes outranne, And match'd the Dayes bright Coach-man in your race, Americus, Columbus, Magellan. It is most true that your ingenious care And well-spent paines another world brought forth, For Beasts, Birds, Trees, for Gemmes and Metals rare, Yet all being earth, was but of earthly worth. Hee a more precious World to vs descryes, Rich in more Treasure then both Indes containe, Faire in more beauty then mans witte can faine, Whose Sunne not sets, whose people neuer dies. Earth shuld your Brows deck with stil-verdant Bayes, But Heauens crowne his with Stars immortall rayes. Master William Drumond of Hawthorn-denne. v. ON THE BOOKE. [Prefixed to “HEPTAMERON, THE SEVEN DAYES,” &amp;c., by A. Symson. Sainct Andrews, 1621, 8vo.] God binding with hid Tendons this great ALL, Did make a LVTE which had all parts it giuen; This LVTES round Bellie was the azur'd Heauen, The Rose those Lights which Hee did there install; The Basses were the Earth and Ocean, The Treble shrill the Aire; the other Strings The vnlike Bodies were of mixed things: And then His Hand to breake sweete Notes began. Those loftie Concords did so farre rebound, That Floods, Rocks, Meadows, Forrests, did them heare, Birds, Fishes, Beasts, danc'd to their siluer sound; Onlie to them Man had a deafned Eare: Now him to rouse from sleepe so deepe and long, God wak'ned hath the Eccho of this Song. W. D. vi. On These Lockes. [Prefixed to “SAMSONS SEAVEN LOCKES OF HAIRE,” by A. Symson, Sainct Andrewes. 1621, 8vo.] Lockes, Ornament of Angels, Diademes Which the triumphing Quires aboue doe crowne; Rich Curles of Bountie, Pinnions of Renowne, Of that immortall Sunne immortall Beames; Lockes, sacred Lockes, no, adamantine Chaines, Which doe shut vp and firme together binde Both that Contentment which in Life wee finde, And Blisse which with vnbodied Soules remaines; Faire Locks, all Locks compar'd to you (though gold) Are Comets-Locks, portending Harme and Wrath, Or bauld Occasions-Locke, that none can holde, Or Absaloms, which worke the Wearers death. If hencefoorth Beautie e're my Minde subdue, It shall (deare Locks) be for what shines in you. W. D. vii. Paraineticon. [Prefixed to “PALLAS ARMATA, OR MILITARIE INSTRUCTIONS for the Learned,” by Sir Thomas Kellie. Edinburgh, 1627, 4to.] Poore Rhene, and canst Thou see Thy Natiues Gore Thy Christall Curles deface, Thy Nymphes so bright which bee, Halfe-Blackamores embrace, And (dull'd with Grapes) yet not resente Thy Case? Fallen are Thy Anadeames, O of such goodlie Cities Famous Flood! Dimm'd bee Thy Beauties Beames, And with Thy Spoyles and Blood Hell is made rich, prowd the Iberian Blood. And You, faire Europes Queen, Which hast with Lillies deckt your purple Seate, Can you see those haue beene Sterne Cometes to Your State, On Neighboures Wracke to grow so hugelie great? Looke how much Iber gaines, By as much lessened is Your flowrie Throne; O doe not take such paines On Bartholomewes alone, But seeke to reacquire your Pampelone. Braue People, which endwell The happiest Ile that Neptunes armes embrace; World, which doth yet excell In what first Worlds did grace, Doe neuer to base seruitude giue Place: Marshalle your Wits and Armes, Your Courage whett with Pittie and Disdaine, Your deeme your Allies Harmes; All lose or re-obtaine, And either Palme or fatall Cypresse gaine. To this Great Spirits Frame If moulded were All Mindes, all Endeuoures, Could Worth thus All inflame, Then not this Ile were Ours Alone, but all betweene Sunnes golden Bowres. W. Drvmmond. viii. OF THE BOOKE. [Prefixed to “THE TRVE CRVCIFIXE FOR TRUE CATHOLICKES,” by Sir William Moore. Edinburgh, 1629, 8vo.] You that with awfull eyes and sad regards, Gazing on Masts of Ships crost with their yards; Or when yee see a Microcosme to swim, At eury stroake the Crucifixe doe limne In your Braines Table; or when smaller things, As pyed Butter-flyes, and Birds their wings Doe raise a Crosse, streight on your knees doe fall And worship; you, that eurye painted wall, Grac't with some antik face, some Godling make, And practise whoordome for the Crosses sake With Bread, stone, mettall; Read these sacred Layes, And (Proselytes) proclaime the Authors praise: Such Fame your Transformation shall him giue, With Homers Euer that his Name shall liue. W. D. Of Hawthorn-denne. ix. [Subjoined to “A FVNERALL SERMON, Preached at the buriall of Lady Iane Maitlane, daughter to the Right Noble Earle, Iohn Earle of Lauderdail.” Edinburgh, 1633, 4to.] The flowre of virgins in her prime of years By ruthlesse destinies is ta'ne away, And rap'd from earth, poore earth, before this day Which ne're was rightly nam'd a vale of tears. Beautie to heauen is fled, sweet modestie No more appears; she whose harmonious sounds Did rauish sense, and charm mindes deepest wounds, Embalm'd with many a tear now low doth lie. Fair hopes evanish'd are; she should have grac'd A princes marriage-bed, but (lo!) in heauen Blest paramours to her were to be giuen; She liu'd an angel, now is with them plac'd. Vertue was but a name abstractly trim'd, Interpreting what she was in effect, A shadow from her frame, which did reflect A portrait by her excellencies lim'd. Thou whom free-will or chance hath hither brought, And readst, here lies a branch of Metlands stem, And Seatons offspring, know that either name Designes all worth yet reach'd by humane thought. Tombs (elsewhere) rise, life to their guests to giue, Those ashes can frail monuments make liue. M. W. Drumond. x. Of Persons Varieties. [Prefixed to “VARIETIES,” &amp;c., by David Person of Loghlands. London, 1635, 4to.] The Lawyer here may learne Divinity, The Diuine Lawes, or faire Astrology, The Dammaret respectiuely to fight, The Duellist to court a Mistresse right; Such who their name take from the Rosie-Crosse, May here by Time learne to repaire their losse: All learne may somewhat, if they be not fooles; Arts quicklier here are lesson'd than in Schooles. xi. Distich, of the same. This Booke a World is; here if errours be, The like (nay worse) in the great world we see. William Drummond, Of Hathorn-den. Posthumous Poems. I. i. [What course of life should wretched Mortalles take?] What course of life should wretched Mortalles take? In courtes hard questiones large contention make; Care dwelles in houses, labour in the feild, Tumultuous seas affrighting dangeres yeild. In foraine landes thou neuer canst be blest, If rich thou art in feare, if poore distrest. In wedlock frequent discontentmentes swell, Vnmaried persones as in desertes dwell. How many troubles are with children borne? Yet hee that wants them countes himself forlorne. Young men are wanton and of wisdome voyd, Gray haires are cold, vnfit to be imployd. Who would not one of those two offeres choose: Not to be borne; or breath with speed to loose? ii. [All good hath left this age, all trackes of shame] All good hath left this age, all trackes of shame, Mercie is banished and pittye dead, Justice from whence it came to heauen is fled, Relligion maim'd is thought an idle Name. Faith to distrust and malice hath giuen place, Enuie with poysond teeth hath freindship torne, Renowned knowledge lurkes, despisd, a scorne, Now it is euill all euill not to embrace. There is no life saue vnder seruile Bandes, To make Desert a Vassall to their crimes Ambition with Auarice ioyne Handes; O euer-shamefull, O most shamelesse Tymes! Saue that Sunnes light wee see, of good heare tell, This Earth wee courte so much were verye Hell. iii. [Doth then the world goe thus, doth all thus moue?] Doth then the world goe thus, doth all thus moue? Is this the Justice which on Earth wee find? Is this that firme decree which all doth bind? Are these your influences Powers aboue? Those soules which Vices moodye Mistes most blind, Blind Fortune blindlie most their friend doth proue: And they who Thee (poore Idole) Vertue loue Plye like a feather toss'd by storme and wind. Ah! (if a Prouidence doth swaye this all?) Why should best Mindes groane vnder most distresse, Or why should pryde Humilitie turne Thrall, And injuryes the Innocent oppresse? Heauens hinder, stope this fate, or grante a Tyme When Good maye haue as well as Bad their prime. iv. A Replye. Who do in good delight That souueraine Iustice euer doth rewarde, And though sometyme it smyte, Yet it doth them reguard; For euen amidst their Griefe They find a strong reliefe: And Death it selfe can worke them no despight. Againe in euill who ioye And doe in it grow old, In midst of Mirth are charg'd with sinnes annoye, Which is in conscience scrolld; And when their lifes fraile thread is cut by Tyme, They punishment find equall to each cryme. v. Beauties Frailtye. Looke how the maying Rose At sulphures azure fumes, In a short space her crimsin blush doth lose, And all amaz'd a pallid whit assumes: So Tyme our best consumes, Makes youth and Beautie passe, And what was pryde turnes horrour in our Glasse. vi. To a swallow, building neare the statue of Medea. Fond Prognèe, chattering wretch, That is Medea, there Wilt thou thy yonglinges hatch? Will shee keep thyne, her own who could not spare? Learne from her franticke face To seeke some fitter place. What other mayst thou hope for, what desire, Saue Stygian spelles, woundes, poison, iron, fire? vii. Venus armed. As to trye new alarmes, In Ioues great Court aboue The wanton Queene of Loue Of sleeping Mars put on the horrid armes. Her gazing in a glasse To see what thing shee was, To mocke and scoffe the blew-eyed maide did moue. Who said, sweet Queene thus should yee haue been dight When Vulcan tooke you napping with your knight. viii. The Boares head. Amidst a pleasant greene Which sunne did seldome see, Where play'd Anchises with the Cyprian Queene, The Head of a wild boare hang on a Tree: And driuen by zephyres breath Did fall, and wound the louelye youth beneath, On whom yet scarce appeares So much of bloud as Venus eyes shed teares. But euer as shee wept her Antheme was, Change, cruell change, alas! My Adon, whilst thou liud, was by thee slaine, Now dead this louer must thou kill againe! ix. To an Owle. Ascalaphus tell mee, So may nights courtaine long tyme couer Thee, So yuie euer maye From irksome light keep chamber thyne and bed, And in moones liurey cled So mayst thou scorne the Quiristeres of Daye: When plaining thou dost staye Neare to the sacred window of my deare, Dost euer thou her heare To wake, and steale swift houres from drowsye sleep? And when shee wakes, doth ere a stollen sigh creep Into thy listning Eare? If that deafe God doth yet her carelesse keep, In lowder notes My Grief with thyne expresse, Till by thy shrickes shee thinke on my distresse. x. Daphnè. Now Daphnès armes did grow In slender Branches, and her braided haire Which like gold waues did flow In leauie Twigs was stretched in the aire; The grace of either foot Transform'd was to a root, A tender Barke enwrapes her Bodye faire. Hee who did cause her ill Sor-wailing stood, and from his blubb'red eyne Did showres of teares vpon the rine distill Which watred thus did bude and turne more greene. O deep Dispaire! o Hart-appalling Griefe! When that doth woe encrease should bring reliefe. xi. The Beare of loue. In woodes and desart Boundes A beast abroad doth roame, So louing sweetnesse and the honnyecombe That it of Beas contemptes alarmes and woundes: I by like pleasure led To proue what heauens did place Of sweet on your faire face, Whilst therewith I am fed, Rest carelesse (Bear of loue) of hellish smart And how those eyes afflicte and wound my hart. xii. Galateas Sonnets. [A.] Joas in vaine thou brings thy rimes and songs Of th' old Thebaine deck't with the withered flowres; In vaine thou tells the faire Europas wrongs, And Hers whom Joue deceau'd with golden showres. I thinke not loue ore thee his wings hath spred, Or if that passion hath thy soule opprest, Its onlie for some Grecian Mistresse dead, Of such old sighs thou doth discharge thy brest. How can true loue with fables hold a place? Thou who thy loue with fables hath enamll'd, Thy loues a fable and thy part dissembled, Thou doth but court my grace more to disgrace: I can not thinke thou art tane with my lookes; Thou did but learne thy loue in louers books. [B.] No more with sugred speach infect my eares, Tell me no more how that yee pine in Anguish, And when yee sleepe no more saye that yee languish, And in delight no more tell yee spend teares. Haue I such owlie eies that they not see How such are made braine-sicke be Appollo, Who foolish boaste the Muses doe them follow? Though in loues lyuery yet no louers be. If wee poore soules a fauor but them show, That straight with wondring pens abroad is blazed, They raise their Name our fame to ouerthrow, Our vice is noted whilst their wits are praised: In silent thoughts who can not secrets couer, He may well saye, but not well be a louer. [C.] Yee who with curious words and Dedals art, Frame laberinthes our Beautie to surprise, Telling strange cassills forged in the skies, And tails of Cupids bow, and Cupids dart; Well, how so ere yee acte your faigned smart, Molesting quiet eares with tragicke cries, When yee accuse our chastities best part, Called Crueltie, yee seeme not halfe too wise. Euen yee your selues estime it worthie praise, Beauties best guard, that Dragon which doth keepe Th' Hesperian fruit, and which in you doth raise That Delian wit which other wayes should sleepe: To cruell Nymphes your lines doe fame afford, Of many pitifull scarce halfe a word. [D.] If it be loue to wish that all the Night Wee spend in sad regreats with waking eies, And when the sunne enpurples all the skies To liue in languish, spoiled of all delight? If it be loue to wish that Reasons light In our wake Minds by passion darkened be, Till Heauen and Earth do scorne our miserie, Whilst blindfold led wee nere doe ought aright? If it be loue to wish our chastetie May subiect be vnto a basse desire, And that our harts heale a more cruell fire Then that Athenian in his Bull did frie? Then sure yee loue; but causers of such woes No louers be to loue, but hatefull foes. [E.] And would yee then shake off loues golden chaine, With which yee saye 'tis freedome to be bound, And cruell heale of loue the noble wound, That yee so soone Hopes blysse seeke to obtaine? All things beneath pale Cynthias changing Round Ore which our Grande dame Nature here doth raigne, What they desire, when they in end haue found, Into decadence fall and slacke remaine: The herbes behold which in the meades doe grow, Till to hight they come but then decaye, The ocean waues tumultuoslie which flow Till they embrace the banks, then rune awaye: So is't with loue: that thou may loue me still, O no! thinke not, I'll yeld vnto thy will. xiii. On the Death of a Margarite. In shelles and gold pearles are not keept alone, A Margarite here lies beneath a stone; A Margarite that did excell in worth All those rich Gemmes the Indies both bring forth; Who had shee liu'd when good was lou'd of men Had made the Graces foure the Muses ten, And forc'd those happye tymes her dayes that claim'd To be from her the age of pearle still nam'd. Shee was the rarest jewell of her kynd, Gract with more beautye than shee left behind, All Goodnesse Vertue Wonder, and could cheare The sadest Minds: Now Nature, knowing heere How Things but showen, then hiden, ar loud best, This Margaret shrin'd in this marble chest. xiv. [Nor Amaranthes nor Roses doe bequeath] Nor Amaranthes nor Roses doe bequeath Vnto this Herse, but Tamariskes and Vine, For that same thirst though dead yet doth him pine, Which made him so carowse whilst hee drew breath. xv. Epitaph. Heer S? lyes, most bitter gall, Who whilst hee liud spoke euill of all, Onlye of God the Arrant Sot Nought said, but that hee knew him not. xvi. The oister. With open shells in seas, on heauenly due A shining oister lushiouslie doth feed, And then the Birth of that ætheriall seed Shows, when conceau'd, if skies lookt darke or blew: So doe my thoughts (celestiall twins) of you, At whose aspect they first beginne &amp; breed, When they are borne to light demonstrat true, If yee then smyld, or lowr'd in murning weed. Pearles then are framd orient, faire in forme, In their conception if the heauens looke cleare; But if it thunder, or menace a storme, They sadlie darke and wannish doe appeare: Right so my thoughts are, so my notes do change, Sweet if yee smyle, &amp; hoarse if yee looke strange. xvii. All Changeth. The angrye winds not ay Doe cuffe the roring deep, And though Heauens often weep Yet doe they smyle for joy when com'd is May, Frosts doe not euer kill the pleasant flowres, And loue hath sweets when gone are all the sowres. This said a shepheard closing in his armes His Deare, who blusht to feele loues new alarmes. xviii. Silenus to King Midas. The greatest Gift that from their loftie Thrones The all-gouerning powers to men can giue Is that hee neuer breath, or breathing once A suckling end his dayes, and leaue to liue: For then hee neither knowes the woe nor joy Of life, nor feares the stigian lakes annoy. xix. To his amorous Thoughts. Sweet wanton thought which art of Beautye borne, And which on Beautye feedst &amp; sweet Desire, Who like the Butterflye dost endlesse turne About that flame that all so much admire; That heauenlye face which doth outblush the Morne, Those yuoryd hands, those Threeds of golden wyre, Thou still surroundest, yet darst not aspire To vew Mynds beautyes which the rest adorne. Sure thou dost well that place not to come neare, Nor see the maiestye of that faire court; For if thow sawst the vertues ther resort, The pure intelligence that moues that spheare, Like soules departed to the Ioyes aboue, Backe neuer wouldst thou come, nor thence remoue. xx. Verses of the late Earl of Pembroke I The doubtfull Feares of change so fright my mynd, Though raised to the highest ioy in loue, As in this slipperye state more Griefe I find Than they who neuer such a Blisse did proue, But fed with lingring Hopes of future Gaine Dreame not what 'tis to doubte a loosers paine. II Desire a safer Harbour is than feare, And not to rise lesse Danger than to fall; The want of jewells wee farre better beare Than so possest, at once to loose them all: Vnsatisfied Hopes Tyme may repaire When ruyn'd Faith must finish in despaire. III Alas! yee looke but vp the Hill on mee, Which showes to you a faire and smooth Ascent, The precipice behind yee can not see, On which high Fortunes are too pronelie bent: If there I slippe what former Ioy or Blisse Can heale the Bruisse of such a fall as this? E. P. xxi. A Replye. I Who loue enjoyes, and placed hath his Minde Where fairer Vertues fairest Beautyes grace, Then in himselfe such store of worth doth finde, That hee deserues to hold so good a place: To chilling Feares how can hee be set forth? Who feares, condemnes his owne, doubtes otheres worth. II Desire, as flames of zeale, Feares, Horrors, meets, They rise who shake of falling neuer prou'd. Who is so daintye, satiate with sweets, To murmure when the bancket is remou'd? The fairest Hopes Tyme in the Budde destroyes, When sweet are Memories of ruyn'd Ioyes. III It is no Hill but Heauen where yee remaine, And whom Desert aduanced hath so hie To reach the Guerdon of his burning paine, Must not repine to fall, and falling die: His Hopes are crown'd; what years of tedious breath Can them compare with such a happy Death? W. D. xxii. A Translation. [Ah! silly Soule, what wilt thou say] 1 Ah! silly Soule, what wilt thou say When he whom earth and Heavens obey Comes Man to judge in the last Day? 2 When He a reason askes, why Grace And Goodnesse thou wouldst not embrace, But steps of Vanity didst trace? 3 That Day of Terrour, Vengeance, Ire, Now to prevent thou should'st desire, And to thy God in haste retire. 4 With watry Eyes, and Sigh-swollen Heart, O beg, beg in his Love a part, Whilst Conscience with remorse doth smart. 5 That dreaded Day of wrath and shame In flames shall turne this Worlds huge Frame, As sacred Prophets do proclaime. 6 O! with what Griefe shall Earthlings grone, When that great Judge set on his Throne, Examines strictly every One. 7 Shrill-sounding Trumpets through the Aire Shall from dark Sepulchres each where Force wretched Mortalls to appeare. 8 Nature and Death amaz'd remaine To find their dead arise againe, And Processe with their Judge maintaine. 9 Display'd then open Books shall lye Which all those secret crimes descry, For which the guilty World must dye. 10 The Judge enthron'd (whom Bribes not gaine) The closest crimes appeare shall plaine, And none unpunished remaine. 11 O who then pitty shall poor me! Or who mine Advocate shall be? When scarce the justest passe shall free. 12 All wholly holy dreadfull King, Who freely life to thine dost bring, Of Mercy save me Mercies spring. 13 Then (sweet Jesu) call to mind How of thy Paines I was the End, And favour let me that day find. 14 In search of me Thou full of paine Did'st sweat bloud, Death on Crosse sustaine, Let not these suff'rings be in vaine. 15 Thou supreame Judge, most just and wise, Purge me from guilt which on me lies Before that day of thine Assize. 16 Charg'd with remorse (loe) here I grone, Sin makes my face a blush take on; Ah! spare me prostrate at thy Throne. 17 Who Mary Magdalen didst spare, And lend'st the Thiefe on Crosse thine Eare; Shewest me fair hopes I should not feare. 18 My prayers imperfect are and weake, But worthy of thy grace them make, And save me from Hells burning Lake. 19 On that great Day at thy right hand Grant I amongst thy Sheep may stand, Sequestred from the Goatish Band. 20 When that the Reprobates are all To everlasting flames made thrall, O to thy Chosen (Lord) me call! 21 That I one of thy Company, With those whom thou dost justifie, May live blest in Eternity. xxiii. To the Memory of [John, Earl of Lauderdale.] [A.] Of those rare worthyes which adorn'd our North And shin'd like constellationes, Thou alone Remained last (great Maitland) chargd with worth, Second on Vertues Theater to none: But finding all eccentricke in our Tymes, Relligione in superstition turn'd, Justice silenc'd, renuersed or enurn'd, Truth faith and charitie reputed crymes: The young Men destinat'd by sword to fall And Trophèes of their countryes spoiles to reare, Strange lawes the ag'd and prudent to appall, And force sad yokes of Tyrannie to beare, And for nor great nor vertuous Mindes a Roome, Disdaining life thou shrunke into thy Tombe. [B.] When Misdeuotione all-where shall haue place, And loftie oratours in Thundring Termes Shall moue you (people) to arise in armes And churches hallowed policie deface: When yee shall but one generall sepulcher (As Auerröes did one generall soule) On high on low, on good on bad confer, And your dull predecessours Rites controule; Ah! spare this Monument; Great Guestes it keepes, Three graue justiciares whom true worth did raise; The Muses Darlinges whose losse Phœbus weepes, Mankynds delight, the Glorie of their Dayes. More wee would saye, but feare and stand in aw To turne Idolators and breake your law. [C.] Doe not repine (blest soule) that vulgare wittes Doe make thy worth the matter of their verse, No high-straind Muse our tymes and sorrowes fittes And wee doe sigh, not sing, to crown thy Herse. The wisest Prince e're manag'd Brittaines state Did not disdaine in numberes cleare and braue The vertues of thy syre to celebrate, And fixe a rich Memoriall ou'r his Graue. Thou didst deserue no lesse, and heere in iet, Gold, Brasse, Touch, Porpherie, the Parian stone, That by a princes hand no lines are set For Thee; the cause is now this land hath none: Such giant moodes our paritie forth bringes, Wee all will nothing be or all be kinges. xxiv. To the Memorie of the excellent ladye Isabell, Countesse of Lawderdale. Fond wight, who dreamest of Greatnesse, Glorie, State, And worlds of pleasures, Honoures dost deuise, Awake, learne how that heere thou art nor great, Nor glorious; by this Monument turne wise. One it enshrineth, sprung of auncient stemme, And (if that Bloud Nobilitie can make) From which some kinges haue not disdaind to take Their prowd Descent, a rare &amp; matchless gemme. A Beautie too heere by it is embrac't, Than which no blooming Rose was more refind, Nor Mornings blush more radiant neuer shind, Ah! too too like to Morne and Rose in last. It holdes her who in wits ascendant farre Did Tymes and sex transcend, to whom the Heauen More vertues than to all this age had giuen, For Vertue Meteore turnd when shee a starre. Faire Mirth, sweet Conuersation, Modestie, And what those kings of numberes did conceaue By Muses Nyne or Graces more than Three, Lye closd within the compasse of this Graue. Thus death all earthlye gloryes doth confound, Loe, what of worth a litle Dust doth bound! xxv. [Far from these Bankes exiled be all Joyes] Far from these Bankes exiled be all Joyes, Contentments, Pleasures, Musick (cares reliefe) Tears, Sighs, Plaints, Horrours, Frightments, sad Annoies Invest these Mountaines, fill all Hearts with Griefe. Here Nightingals and Turtles, vent your moanes; Amphrisian Shepheard here come feed thy Flockes, And read thy Hyacinth amidst our Groanes, Plaine Eccho thy Narcissus from our Rocks. Lost have our Meads their Beauty, Hills their Gemms, Our Brooks their Christall, Groves their pleasant shade, The fairest Flow'r of all our Anademms Death cropped hath, the Lesbia chaste is dead. Thus sigh'd the Tyne, then shrunke beneath his Urne, And Meads, Brooks, Rivers, Hills about did mourne. xxvi. [Like to the Gardens Eye, the Flower of Flow'rs] Like to the Gardens Eye, the Flower of Flow'rs With purple Pompe that dazle doth the Sight; Or as among the lesser Gems of Night, The Usher of the Planet of the Houres: Sweet Maid, thou shinedst on this World of ours, Of all Perfections having trac'd the hight, Thine outward frame was faire, faire inward Powers, A Saphire Lanthorne, and an incense light. Hence, the enamour'd Heaven as too too good On Earths all-thorny soyle long to abide, Transplanted to their Fields so rare a Bud, Where from thy Sun no cloud thee now can hide. Earth moan'd her losse, and wish'd she had the grace Not to have known, or known thee longer space. xxvii. Madrigal. [Hard Laws of mortall Life!] Hard Laws of mortall Life! To which made Thrales, we come without consent Like Tapers lighted to be early spent, Our Griefes are alwaies rife, When joyes but halting march, and swiftly fly Like shadows in the Eye: The shadow doth not yeeld unto the Sun, But Joyes and Life do waste even when begun. xxviii. On the death of a nobleman in Scotland, buried at Aithen. Aithen, thy Pearly Coronet let fall; Clad in sad Robes, upon thy Temples set, The weeping Cypresse, or the sable Jet. Mourne this thy Nurslings losse, a losse which all Apollos quire bemoanes, which many yeares Cannot repaire, nor Influence of Spheares. Ah! when shalt thou find Shepheard like to him, Who made thy Bankes more famous by his worth, Then all those Gems thy Rocks and Streams send forth? His splendor others Glow-worm light did dim, Sprung of an ancient and a vertuous Race, He Vertue more than many did embrace. He fram'd to mildnesse thy halfe-barbarous swaines, The Good-mans refuge, of the bad the fright, Unparaleld in friendship, worlds Delight, For Hospitality along thy Plaines Far-fam'd, a Patron, and a Patterne faire, Of Piety, the Muses chiefe repaire. Most debonaire, in Courtesie supreame, Lov'd of the meane, and honour'd by the Great, Ne're dasht by Fortune, nor cast down by Fate, To present, and to after Times a Theame. Aithen, thy Teares poure on this silent Grave, And drop them in thy Alabaster cave, And Niobes Imagery become; And when thou hast distilled here a Tombe, Enchace in it thy Pearls, and let it beare, Aithens best Gem and honour shrin'd lies here. xxix. Epitaph. Fame, Register of Tyme, Write in thy scrowles, that I, A wisdome louer, and sweet poesie, Was croped in my Prime, And ripe in worth, though scarce in yeares, did die. xxx. [Justice, Truth, Peace, and Hospitalitie] Justice, Truth, Peace, and Hospitalitie, Friendship, and Loue, being resolued to dye In these lewd tymes, haue chosen heere to haue With just, true, pious, kynd DALYELL their graue; Hee them cherish'd so long, so much did grace, That they than this would choose no dearer place. xxxi. [When Death to deck his Trophees stopt thy breath] When Death to deck his Trophees stopt thy breath, Rare Ornament and Glory of these Parts: All with moist Eyes might say, and ruthfull hearts, That things immortall vassal'd were to Death. What Good, in Parts on many shar'd we see From Nature, gracious Heaven, or Fortune flow, To make a Master-Piece of worth below, Heaven, Nature, Fortune, gave in grosse to Thee. In Honour, Bounty, Rich, in Valour, Wit, In Courtesie, Borne of an ancient Race, With Bayes in war, with Olives crown'd in Peace, Match'd great, with Off-spring for great Actions fit. No Rust of Times, nor Change, thy Vertue wan, With Times to change, when Truth, Faith, Love decay'd, In this new Age (like Fate) thou fixed stay'd Of the first World an all-substantiall Man. As earst this Kingdome given was to thy Syre, The Prince his Daughter trusted to thy Care, And well the credit of a Gem so rare Thy loyalty and merit did require. Yeares cannot wrong thy Worth, that now appeares By others set as Diamonds among Pearles, A Queens deare Foster, Father to three Earles, Enough on Earth to triumph are o're yeares. Life a Sea-voyage is, Death is the Haven, And fraught with honour there thou hast arriv'd, Which Thousands seeking have on Rocks been driven, That Good adornes thy Grave, which with thee liv'd: For a fraile Life which here thou didst enjoy, Thou now a lasting hast freed of Annoy. xxxii. [Within the Closure of this Narrow Grave] Within the Closure of this Narrow Grave Lye all those Graces a Good-wife could have: But on this Marble they shall not be read, For then the Living envy would the Dead. xxxiii. [The daughter of a king, of princelye partes] The daughter of a king, of princelye partes, In Beautie eminent, in Vertues cheife, Load-starre of loue and load-stone of all Hartes, Her freindes and Husbandes onlie Joy, now Griefe, Enclosed lyes within this narrow Graue, Whose Paragone no Tymes, no Climates haue. xxxiv. [Verses fraile Records are to keep a Name] Verses fraile Records are to keep a Name, Or raise from Dust Men to a Life of Fame, The sport and spoyle of Ignorance; but far More fraile the Frames of Touch and Marble are, Which envy, Avarice, Time e're long confound, Or mis-devotion equalls with the Ground. Vertue alone doth last, frees man from Death, And, though despis'd and scorned here beneath, Stands grav'n in Angels Diamantine Rolles, And blazed in the Courts above the Poles. Thou wast faire Vertues Temple, they did dwell, And live ador'd in thee, nought did excell But what thou either didst possesse or love, The Graces Darling, and the maids of Jove, Courted by Fame for Bounties which the Heaven Gave thee in great, which if in Parcels given To many, such we happy sure might call, How happy then wast thou who enjoyedst them all? A whiter Soule ne're body did invest, And now (sequestred) cannot be but blest, Inrob'd in Glory, 'midst those Hierarchies Of that immortall People of the Skies, Bright Saints and Angels, there from cares made free Nought doth becloud thy soveraign Good from Thee. Thou smil'st at Earths Confusions and Jars, And how for Centaures Children we wage wars: Like honey Flies, whose rage whole swarmes consumes Till Dust thrown on them makes them vaile their plumes. Thy friends to thee a Monument would raise, And limne thy Vertues; but dull griefe thy Praise Breakes in the Entrance, and our Taske proves vaine, What duty writes that woe blots out againe: Yet Love a Pyramid of Sighs thee reares, And doth embaulme thee with Fare-wells and Teares. xxxv. Rose. Though Marble, Porphyry, and mourning Touch— May praise these spoiles, yet can they not too much; For Beauty last, and this Stone doth close, Once Earths Delight, Heavens care, a purest Rose. And (Reader) shouldst thou but let fall a Teare Upon it, other flow'rs shall here appeare, Sad Violets and Hyacinths which grow With markes of griefe: a publike losse to show. xxxvi. [Relenting Eye, which daignest to this Stone] Relenting Eye, which daignest to this Stone To lend a look, behold, here be laid one, The Living and the Dead interr'd, for Dead The Turtle in its Mate is; and she fled From Earth, her choos'd this Place of Griefe To bound Thoughts, a small and sad Reliefe. His is this Monument, for hers no Art Could frame, a Pyramide rais'd of his Heart. xxxvii. [Instead of Epitaphs and airy praise] Instead of Epitaphs and airy praise This Monument a Lady chaste did raise To her Lords living fame, and after Death Her Body doth unto this Place bequeath, To rest with his, till Gods shrill Trumpet sound, Though time her Life, no time her love could bound. Posthumous Poems. II. i. [The scottish kirke the English church doe name] The scottish kirke the English church doe name, The english church the Scotes a kirke doe call; Kirke and not church, church and not kirke, O shame! Your kappa turne in chi, or perishe all: Assemblies meet, post Bishopes to the court; If these two Nationes fight, its strangeres sport. ii. [Against the king, sir, now why would yee fight?] Against the king, sir, now why would yee fight? Forsooth because hee made mee not a knight. And yee my lordes, why arme yee against Charles? Because of lordes hee would not make us Earles. Earles, why lead you forth these angrye bandes? Because wee will not quite the churches landes. Most hollye church-Men, what is your intent? The king our stipendes largelie did augment. Commones, to tumult thus how are yee driuen? Our priestes say fighting is the way to Heauen. Are these iust cause of Warre, good Bretheren, grante? Him Plunder! hee nere swore our couenant. Giue me a thousand couenants, I'll subscriue Them all, and more, if more yee can contriue Of rage and malice; and let eurye one Blake treason beare, not bare Rebellione. I'll not be mockt, hist, plunder'd, banisht hence For more yeeres standing for a . . . prince. The castells all are taken, and his crown, The sword and sceptre, ensignes of Renown, With the lieutenant fame did so extoll, And all led captiues to the Capitoll; I'll not die Martire for any mortall thing, It's enough to be confessour for a king. Will this you giue contentment, honest Men? I haue written Rebelles, pox vpon the pen! iii. [The King a Negative Voice most justly hath] The King a Negative Voice most justly hath, Since the Kirk hath found out a Negative Faith. iv. [In parlament one voted for the king] In parlament one voted for the king, The crowd did murmur hee might for it smart; His voice again being heard, was no such thing, For that which was mistaken was a fart. v. [Bold Scotes, at Bannochburne yee killd your king] Bold Scotes, at Bannochburne yee killd your king, Then did in parlament approue the fact; And would yee Charles to such a non-plus bring, To authorize Rebellion by an act? Well, what yee craue, who knowes but granted maye be? But if hee do it, cause swadle him for a Babye. vi. A Replye. Swadl'd is the Babye, and almost two yeeres (His swadling tyme) did neither crye nor sturre, But star'd, smyld, did lye still, void of all feares, And sleept, though barked at by eurye curre: Yea, had not wakt, if Leslea, that hoarse Nurce, Had not him hardlie rock't; old wyues him curse! vii. [The king nor Bond nor oath had him to follow] The king nor Bond nor oath had him to follow Of all his subiects; they were giuen to Thee, Leslea. Who is the greatest? By Apollo, The Emprour thou, some palsgraue scarce seemd hee. Could thou throw lordes as wee doe bishopes down, Small distance were between thee and a crown. viii. On Pime. When Pime last night descended into Hell, Ere hee his coupes of Lethè did carouse, What place is this (said hee) I pray mee tell? To whom a Diuell: This is the lower howse. ix. The Statue of Alcides. Flora vpon a tyme Naked Alcides statue did behold, And with delight admird each arme and lime: Onlie one fault (shee said) could be of it told; For by right symmetrye The craftsman had him wrongd, To such talle iointes a taller club belongd. The club hung by his thigh: To which the statuary angrie did replye, Faire Nymphe, in auncient dayes your holes by farre, Were not so hudglye vast as now they are. x. [Great lyes they preach who tell the church cannot err] Great lyes they preach who tell the church cannot err, Lesse lyes, who tell the king's not head of her; Great lyes, who saye we may shed bretherens blood, Lesse lyes, who tell dombe bishopes are not good; Great lyes they preach, saye we for Religion fight, Lesse lyes who saye the king does nothing right; Great lyes &amp; less lyes, fooles will saye heere I Playe on Mens nailes. Who sayes so doth not lie. xi. [Most royall sir, heere I doe you beseech] Most royall sir, heere I doe you beseech Who art a lyon, to heare a lyons speech; A Miracle; for since the dayes of Æsope Till ours no lyon yet his voice dard hoise up To such a Majestie. Then, king of Men, The king of Beastes speakes to thee from his Den; A fountaine now. That lyon which was lead By Androclus through Rome had not a head More rationale than this, bred in this Nation, Who in your presence warbleth his oration; For though hee heere enclosed be in plaster, When hee was free hee was the Townes Shole Master. Then like a Thisbè let mee not affraye You when from Ninus Tombe shee ranne away. This well yee see is not that Arethusa The Nymphe of Sicily, no! Men may carowse a Health of plump Ly?us noblest Grapes From these faire conduites, and turne drunke like apes. This sacred spring I keep as did that Dragon Hesperian apples. And now Sir, a plague on This poore Town if heere yee be not Well come; But who can question this, when euen a Well come Is, euen the gate. I would say more; But words now failing, dare not, least I rore. xii. The country Maid. A country Maid amazon-like did ryde, To sit more sure with legge on either syde; Her Mother who her spyed, sayd that ere long Shee might due pennance suffer for that wrong; For when tyme should more yeeres on her bestow, That Horses haire between her thighes would grow. Scarce winter twice was come, as was her told, When shee found all to frizell there with gold, Which first her made affraid, then turnd her sicke, And keept her in her bed almost a weeke. At last her mother calls, who scarce for laughter Could heare the pleasant storie of her daughter; But that this thought no longer should her vex Shee said that barded thus was all the sex; And to proue true that now shee did not scorne, Reueald to her the gate where shee was borne. The girle, that seeing, cryed, now freed of paine, Ah! Mother, yee haue ridden on the maine. xiii. [Gods iudgments seldome vse to cease, vnlesse] Gods iudgments seldome vse to cease, vnlesse The sinnes which them procurd men doe confesse. Our cryes are Baalles priestes, our fasting vaine, Our prayers not heard, nor answered vs againe: Till periurye, wrong, rebellion, be confest, Thinke not on peace, nor to be fred of pest. xiv. [The King gives yearly to his Senate Gold] The King gives yearly to his Senate Gold Who can deny but Justice then is sold! xv. Epitaph. Heere Rixus lies, a Nouice in the lawes, Who plaines Hee came to Hell without a cause. xvi. Translation of the death of a sparrow, out of Passerat. Ah! if yee aske (my friendes) why this salt shower My blubbered eyes vpon this paper power, Dead is my sparrow; he whom I did traine, And turnd so toward, by a cat is slaine. Skipping no more now shall hee on me attend. Light displeaseth: would my dayes could end! Ill heare no more him chirpe forth prettye layes; Haue I not cause to curse my wretched dayes? A Dedalus hee was to snatch a flye, Nor wrath nor wildnesse men in him could spye; If to assault his taile that any dard, He pinchd their fingers, and against them warrd: Then might bee seene the crest shake vp &amp; down, Which fixed was vpon his litle crown; Like Hectores, Troyes strong bulwarke, when in ire Hee ragd to set the Grecian fleet on fire. But ah, alas! a cat this pray espyes, Then with a traitrous leap did it surprise. Vndoubtedlie this bird was killd by treason, Or otherwise should of that feind had reason. So Achilles thus by Phrigian heard was slaine, And stout Camilla fell by Aruns vaine: So that false horse which Pallas raisd gainst Troy, Priame &amp; that faire cittye did destroy. Thou now, whose heart is swelled with this vaine glorye, Shalt not liue long to count thy honours storye. If any knowledge bideth after death In sprites of Birdes whose bodyes haue no breath, My dearlings sprit sal know in lower place, The vangeance falling on the cattish race. For neuer chat nor catling I sal find, But mawe they shall in Plutos palace blind. Ye who with panted pens &amp; bodies light Doe dint the aire, turne hadervart your flight, To my sad teares apply these notes of yours, Vnto this Idol bring a Harvest of flours; Let him accepte from vs, as most deuine, Sabean incense, milke, food, suetest vine; And on a stone these vords let some engraue: The litle Body of a sparrow braue In a foul gloutonous chats vombe closd remaines, Vhose ghost now graceth the Elysian plaines. xvii. Saint Peter, after the denying his master. Like to the solitarie pelican, The shadie groues I hant &amp; Deserts wyld, Amongst woods Burgesses, from sight of Man, From earths delights, from myne owne selfe exild. But that remorse which with my falle beganne, Relenteth not, nor is by change beguild, But rules my soule, and like a famishd chyld Renewes its cryes, though Nurse doe what shee can. Looke how the shricking Bird that courtes the Night In ruind walles doth lurke, &amp; gloomie place: Of Sunne, of Moone, of Starres, I shune the light, Not knowing where to stray, what to embrace: How to Heauens lights should I lift these of myne, Since I denyed him who made them shine? xviii. [The woefull Marie midst a blubbred band] The woefull Marie midst a blubbred band Of weeping virgines, neare vnto the Tree Where God Death sufferd, Man from Death to free, Like to a plaintfull Nightingale did stand, That sees her younglings reft before her eies And hath nought else to guarde them but her cries. Loue thither had her brought, and misbeliefe Of that report which charg'd her mind with feares, But now her eies more wretched than her eares Bare witnesse (ah! too true) of feared griefe: Her doubtes make certaine, and her Hopes destroy, Abandoning her soule to blacke annoy. Long fixing downecast eies on earth, at last Shee longing did them raise (O torturing sight!) To view what they did shune, their sole delight, Embrued in his owne bloud, and naked plac't To sinefull eies, naked saue that blake vaile Which Heauen him shrouded with, that did bewaile. It was not pittie, paine, griefe, did possesse The Mother, but an agonie more strange; When shee him thus beheld, her hue did change, Her life (as if shee bled his bloud) turnd less: Shee sought to plaine, but woe did words deny, And griefe her suffred onlye sigh, O my, O my deare Lord and Sone! Then shee began: Immortall birth! though of a mortall borne, Eternall Bontie which doth heauen adorne, Without a Mother, God; a father, Man: Ah! what hast thou deserud, what hast thou done, Thus to be vs'd? Wooe 's mee, my sone, my sone! How blamed 's thy face, the glorie of this All! How dim'd thyne eyes, loade-starres to Paradise! Who, as thou now wert trim'd a sacrifice, Who did thy temples with this crown impale? Who raisd thee, whom so oft the angelles serud, Betwext those theeues who that foul Death deserud? Was it for this I bred thee in my wombe, My armes a cradle made thee to repose, My milke thee fed, as morning dewe the Rose? Did I thee keep till this sad time should come, That wretched Men should naile thee to a Tree, And I a witnesse of thy panges must bee? It is not long, the way o'respred with flowres, With shoutes to ecchoing Heauen and Montaines rold, Since (as in triumph) I thee did behold With royall pompe aproch proud Sions Towres: Loe, what a change! who did thee then embrace, Now at thee shake their heads, inconstant race! Eternall Father! from whose piercing eie Hide nought is found that in this All is found, Daigne to vouschafe a looke vpon this Round, This Round, the stage of a sad Tragedie: Looke but if thy deare pledge thou heere canst know, On an vnhappie Tree a shamefull show. Ah! looke if this be hee almightie King, Ere that Heauen spangled was with starres of gold, Ere World a center had it to vphold, Whom from eternitie thou forth didst bring. With vertue, forme and light, who did adorne Heauens radiant Globes, see where he hangs a scorne. Did all my prayers serue for this? Is this The promise that celestiall herault made At Nazareth, when ah! to mee he said I happy was, and from thee did mee blisse? How am I blist? No, most vnhappy I Of all the Mothers vnderneath the skie. How true and of choysd oracles the choice Was that, blist Hebrew, whose deare eies in peace Sweet Death did close, ere they saw this disgrace, Whenas thou saidst with more than angelles voice, The son should (Malice sign) be set apart, Then that a sword should pierce the mothers hart! But whither dost thou goe, life of my soule? O stay while that I may goe with thee; And do I liue thee languishing to see, And can not griefe fraile lawes of life controule? Griefe, if thou canst not, come cruel squadrons, kill The Mother, spare the sonne, he knowes no ill; Hee knowes no ill; those pangs, fierce men, are due To mee and all the world, saue him alone; But now he doth not heare my bitter mone; Too late I crye, too late I plaintes renew; Pale are his lips, downe doth his head decline, Dim turn those eies once wont so bright to shine. The Heauens which in their orbes still constant moue, That guiltie they may not seeme of this crime, Benighted haue the golden eie of Time. And thou, base Earth, all this thou didst approue, Vnmoud, this suffrest done upon thy face! Earth trembled then, and shee did hold her peace. xix. A Character of the Anti-Couenanter, or Malignant. Would yee know these royall knaues Of free Men would turne vs slaues; Who our Vnion doe defame With Rebellions Wicked Name? Read these Verses, and yee il spring them, Then on Gibbetes straight cause hing them. They complaine of sinne and follye, In these tymes so passing hollye They their substance will not giue, Libertines that we maye liue; Hold that people too too wantom, Vnder an old king dare cantom. They neglecte our circular Tables, Scorne our actes and lawes as fables, Of our battales talke but meeklye, With sermones foure content them weeklye, Sweare King Charles is neither Papist, Armenian, Lutherian, Atheist; But that in his Chamber-Prayers, Which are pour'd 'midst Sighs and Tears, To avert God's fearful Wrath, Threatning us with Blood and Death, Persuade they would the Multitude, This King too holy is and good. They avouch we'll weep and groan When Hundred Kings we serve for one, That each Shire but Blood affords To serve the Ambition of young Lords, Whose Debts ere now had been redoubled, If the State had not been troubled. Slow they are our Oath to swear, Slower for it Arms to bear; They do Concord love and Peace, Would our Enemies embrace, Turn Men Proselytes by the Word, Not by Musket, Pike, and Sword. They Swear that for Religion's Sake We may not massacre, burn, sack; That the Beginning of these Pleas Sprang from the ill-sped ABC's; For Servants that it is not well Against their Masters to Rebel; That that Devotion is but slight Doth force men first to swear, then fight; That our Confession is indeed Not the Apostolick CREED, Which of Negations we contrive, Which Turk and Jew may both subscrive; That Monies should Men's Daughters marry, They on frantick War miscarry, Whilst dear the Souldiers they pay, At last who will snatch all away, And as Times turn worse and worse, Catechise us by the Purse; That Debts are paid with bold stern Looks, That Merchants pray on their Compt-books; That Justice, dumb and sullen, frowns To see in Croslets hang'd her Gowns; That Preachers ordinary Theme Is 'gainst Monarchy to declaim; That since Leagues we began to swear, Vices did ne're so black appear; Oppression, Blood-shed, ne're more rife, Foul Jars between the Man and Wife; Religion so contemn'd was never, Whilst all are raging in a Fever. They tell by Devils and some sad Chance That that detestable League of France, Which cost so many Thousand Lives, And Two Kings by Religious Knives, Is amongst us, though few descry; Though they speak Truth, yet say they Lye. Hee that sayes that night is night, That halting folk walk not vpright, That the owles into the spring Doe not nightingalles outsing; That the seas wee can not plough, Plant strawberryes in the raine-bow; That waking men doe not sound sleep, That the fox keepes not the sheep; That alls not gold doth gold appeare, Belieue him not although hee sweere. To such syrenes stope your eare, Their societyes forbeare. Tossed you may be like a waue, Veritye may you deceaue; True fools they may make of you; Hate them worse than Turke or Jew. Were it not a dangerous Thing, Should yee againe obey the king, Lordes losse should souueraigntie, Souldiours haste backe to Germanie, Justice should in your Townes remaine, Poore Men possesse their own againe, Brought out of Hell that word of plunder More terrible than diuell &amp; Thunder, Should with the Couenant flye away, And charitye amongst vs stay? When yee find those lying fellowes, Take &amp; flowere with them the Gallowes; On otheres yee maye too laye hold, In purse or chestes if they haue Gold. Who wise or rich are in the Nation, Malignants are by protestation. Peace and plentie should vs nurish, True religion with vs flourish. xx. Song of Passerat. Amintas, Daphnè. D. Shephard loueth thow me vell? A. So vel that I cannot tell. D. Like to vhat, good shephard, say? A. Like to the, faire, cruell May. D. Ah! how strange thy vords I find! But yet satisfie my mind; Shephard vithout flatterie, Beares thow any loue to me, Like to vhat, good shephard, say? A. Like to the, faire, cruell May. D. Better answer had it beene To say, I loue thee as mine eine. A. Voe is me, I loue them not, For be them loue entress got, At the time they did behold Thy sueet face &amp; haire of gold. D. Like to vhat, good shephard, say? A. Like to thee, faire cruell May. D. But, deare shephard, speake more plaine, And I sal not aske againe; For to end this gentle stryff Doth thow loue me as thy lyff? A. No, for it doth eb &amp; flow Vith contrare teeds of grief &amp; voe; And now I thruch loues strange force A man am not, but a dead corse. D. Like to vhat, good shephard, say? A. Like to thee, faire, cruel May. D. This like to thee, O leaue, I pray, And as my selfe, good shephard, say. A. Alas! I do not loue my selff, For I me split on beuties shelff. D. Like to vhat, good shephard, say? A. Like to the, faire, cruel May. xxi. [The Kirrimorians and Forfarians met at Muirmoss] The Kirrimorians and Forfarians met at Muirmoss, The Kirrimorians beat the Forfarians back to the Cross. Sutors ye are, and Sutors ye'll be; F?s upon Forfar, Kirrimuir bears the Gree. xxii. [Of all these Rebelles raisd against the king] Of all these Rebelles raisd against the king It's my strange hap not one whole man to bring: From diuerse parishes yet diuerse men; But all in halfes and quarteres: Great king, then, In halfes and quarteres sith they come gainst Thee, In halfes and quarteres send them back to mee. Posthumous Poems. III. i. D. A. Johnstones Eden-Bourgh. Install'd on Hills, her Head neare starrye bowres Shines Eden-Bourgh, prowd of protecting powers. Justice defendes her Heart; Religion East With temple decketh; Mars with towres doth guard the West; Fresh Nymphes and Ceres seruing, waite vpon her, And Thetis (tributarie) doth her honour. The sea doth Venice shake, Rome Tiber beates, Whilst shee but scornes her Vassall Watteres Threates. For scepteres no where standes a Town more fitt, Nor place where Town Worlds Queene may fairer sitt. SONNETS. ii. To the honorable Author, S[ir] J[ohn] Sk[ene]. All lawes but cob-webes are, but none such right Had to this title as these lawes of ours, Ere that they were from their cimerian Bowres By thy ingenious labours brought to light. Our statutes senslesse statues did remaine, Till thou (a new Prometheus) gaue them breath, Or like ag'd Æsons bodye courb'd to death, When thou young bloud infus'd in eurye veine. Thrice-happye Ghosts! which after-worlds shall wow, That first tam'd barbarisme by your swords, Then knew to keepe it fast in nets of words, Hindring what men not suffer would to doe; To Joue the making of the World is due, But that it turnes not chaos, is to you. iii. [O Tymes, o Heauen that still in motion art] O Tymes, o Heauen that still in motion art, And by your course confound vs mortall wights! O flying Dayes! o euer-gliding Nights, Which passe more nimble than wind or archers dart! Now I my selfe accuse, excuse your part, For hee who fixd your farr-off shining lights, You motion gaue, and did to mee impart A Mind to marke and to preuent your slights. Lifes web yee still weaue out, still (foole) I stay, Malgrè my iust Resolues, on mortall things. Ah! as the Bird surprisd in subtile springs, That beates with wing but cannot flye away, So struggle I, and faine would change my case, But this is not of Nature, but of grace. iv. [Rise to my soule, bright Sunne of Grace, o rise!] Rise to my soule, bright Sunne of Grace, o rise! Make mee the vigour of thy Beames to proue, Dissolue this chilling frost which on mee lies, That makes mee lesse than looke-warme in thy loue: Grant mee a beamling of thy light aboue To know my foot-steps, in these Tymes, too wise; O! guyde my course &amp; let mee no mor moue On wings of sense, where wandring pleasure flyes. I haue gone wrong &amp; erred, but ah, alas! What can I else doe in this dungeon darke? My foes strong are, &amp; I a fragil glasse, Houres charged with cares consume my lifes small sparke; Yet, of thy goodnesse, if I grace obtaine, My life shall be no lose, my death great gaine. v. [First in the orient raign'd th' assyrian kings] First in the orient raign'd th' assyrian kings, To those the sacred persian prince succeeds, Then he by whom the world sore-wounded bleeds, Earths crowne to Greece with bloodie blade he brings; Then Grece to Rome the Raines of state resignes: Thus from the mightie Monarche of the Meeds To the west world successiuelie proceeds That great and fatall period of all things; Whilst wearied now with broyles and long alarmes, Earths maiestie her diademe layes downe Before the feet of the vnconquered crowne, And throws her selfe (great Monarch) in thy armes. Here shall she staye, fates haue ordained so, Nor has she where nor further for to goe. vi. Sonnet before a poëme of Irene. Mourne not (faire Grece) the ruine of thy kings, Thy temples raz'd, thy forts with flames deuour'd, Thy championes slaine, thy virgines pure deflowred, Nor all those greifes which sterne Bellona brings: But murne (faire Grece) mourne that that sacred band Which made thee once so famous by their songs, Forct by outrageous fate, haue left thy land, And left thee scarce a voice to plaine thy wrongs; Murne that those climates which to thee appeare Beyond both Ph?bus and his sisteres wayes, To saue thy deedes from death must lend thee layes, And such as from Museus thou didst heare; For now Irene hath attaind such fame, That Heros Ghost doth weep to heare her name. vii. [I feare to me such fortune be assignd] I feare to me such fortune be assignd As was to thee, who did so well deserue, Braue Hakerstowne, euen suffred here to sterue Amidst basse minded freinds, nor true, nor kind. Why were the fates and furies thus combind, Such worths for such disasters to reserue? Yet all those euills neuer made the suerue From what became a well resolued mind; For swelling Greatnesse neuer made the smyle, Dispising Greatnesse in extreames of want; O happy thrice whom no distresse could dant! Yet thou exclaimed, ô Time! ô Age! ô Isle! Where flatterers, fooles, baudes, fidlers, are rewarded, Whilst Vertue sterues vnpittied, vnregarded. viii, ix Sonnet qu'un poet[e] Italien fit pour vn bracelet de cheveux qui lui auoit estè donnè par sa maistresse. In the same sort of rime. O haire, sueet haire, part of the tresse of gold Of vich loue makes his nets vher vretchet I Like simple bird vas taine, and vhile I die Hopelesse I hope your faire knots sal me hold; Yow to embrasse, kisse, and adore I'm bold, Because ye schadow did that sacred face, Staine to al mortals, vich from starrie place Hath jalous made these vho in spheares ar rold: To yow I'l tel my thochts &amp; invard paines Since sche by cruel Heauens now absent is, And cursed Fortune me from her detaines. Alas! bear vitnesse how my reason is Made blind be loue, vhile as his nets and chaines I beare about vhen I should seeke my blisse. x. Sonnet qu'un poet[e] Italien fit pour vn bracelet de cheveux qui lui auoit estè donnè par sa maistresse. In frier sort of rime. O haire, faire haire, some of the goldin threeds Of vich loue veues the nets that passion breeds, Vher me like sillie bird he doth retaine, And onlie death can make me free againe; Ah I yow loue, embrasse, kisse, and adore, For that ye schadow did that face before; That face so ful of beautie, grace, and loue, That it hath jalous made Heauens quier aboue: To yow I'l tel my secret thochts and grief Since sche, deare sche, can graunt me no reliefe. Vhile me from her, foul traitour, absence binds, Vitnesse, sueet haire, vith me, how loue me blinds; For vhen I should seeke vhat his force restraines, I foolish beare about his nets and chaines. xi. Sonnet qu'un poet[e] Italien fit pour vn bracelet de cheveux qui lui auoit estè donnè par sa maistresse. Paraphrasticalie translated. Haire, suet haire, tuitchet by Midas hand In curling knots, of vich loue makes his nets, Vho vhen ye loosest hang me fastest band To her, vorlds lilie among violets; Deare fatall present, kissing I adore yow, Because of late ye shade gaue to these roses That this earths beautie in ther red encloses; I saw vhile ye them hid thay did decore yow: I'l plaine my voes to yow, I'l tel my thocht, Alas! since I am absent from my juel, By vayvard fortune and the heauens more cruel. Vitnesse be ye vhat loue in me hath vrocht, In steed to seeke th' end of my mortall paines, I take delyt to veare his goldin chaines. xii, xiii. Bembo in his Rime. 2 Son. In the same sort of Rime. As the yong faune, vhen vinters gone avay Vnto a sueter saison granting place, More vanton growne by smyles of heuens faire face, Leauith the silent voods at breake of day, And now on hils, and now by brookes doth pray On tender flowres, secure and solitar, Far from all cabans, and vher shephards are; Vher his desir him guides his foote doth stray, He fearith not the dart nor other armes Til he be schoot in to the noblest part By cuning archer, vho in dark bush lyes: So innocent, not fearing comming harmes, Vandering vas I that day vhen your faire eies, Vorld-killing schafts, gaue deaths vounds to my hart. xiv. Bembo in his Rime. 2 Son. In rime more frie. As the yong stag, vhen vinter hids his face Giuing vnto a better season place, At breake of day comes furth vanton and faire, Leauing the quiet voods, his suet repaire, Now on the hils, now by the riuers sides, He leaps, he runs, and vher his foote him guides, Both sure and solitaire, prayes on suet flowrs, Far fra al shephards and their helmish bours; He doth not feare the net nor murthering dart, Til that, pour beast, a schaft be in his hart, Of on quho pitilesse in embush laye: So innocent vandring that fatall daye Vas I, alas! vhen vith a heauenlie eie, Ye gaue the blowe vher of I needs must die. xv. Bembo in his Rime. 2 Son. Paraphrasticalie translated. As the yong hart, when sunne with goldin beames Progressith in the first post of the skie, Turning old vinters snowie haire in streames, Leauith the voods vher he vas vont to lie, Vher his desir him leads the hills among, He runes, he feades, the cruking brookes along, Emprison'd onlie with heauens canopie; Vanton he cares not ocht that dolour brings, Hungry he spares not flowres vith names of kings; He thinkes al far, vho can him fol espie, Til bloudie bullet part his chefest part: In my yong spring, alas! so vandred I, Vhen cruel sche sent out from iettie eie The deadlie schaft of vich I bleding smart. MADRIGALS. xvi. On the image of Lucrece. Wise Hand, which wiselie wroght That dying Dame who first did banish kings, Thy light &amp; shadow brings In doubt the wondring thought, If it a substance be or faignet show, That doth so liuelie smart. The colours stroue for to haue made her liue, Wer not thy hart said No, That fear'd perchance the wound so should her griue: Yet in the fatall blow She seemes to speake, nay speakes with Tarquins hart; But death her stays, surprising her best part. xvii. Neroes image. A cunning hand it was Of this hard rocke did frame That monster of all ages, mankinds shame, Ferce Nero, hells disgrace: Of wit, sence, pitie void, Did he not liuing, marble hard surpasse, His mother, master, countrie, all destroyed? Not altring his first case, A stone he was when set vpon a throne, And now a stone he is, although throwne downe. xviii. Amphion of marble. This Amphion, Phidias frame, Though sencelesse it apeare, Doth liue, and is the same Did Thebes towres vpreare; And if his harpe he tuitche not to your eare, No wonder, his harmonious sounds alone Wauld you amaze, &amp; change him selfe in stone. xix. Of a Be. Ingenious was that Bee In lip that wound which made, And kind to others, though vnkind to thee; For by a iust exchange, On that most liulie red It giues to those reuenge, Whom that delitious, plump, and rosie part, All pittilesse (perhaps) now wounds the hart. xx. Of Chloris. Forth from greene Thetis Bowers The morne arose; her face A wreath of rayes did grace, Her haire raind pearles, her hand &amp; lap dropt flowres. Led by the pleasant sight Of those so rich and odoriferous showres, Each shepheard thither came, &amp; nimphes bright: Entrancd they stood; I did to Chloris turne, And saw in her more grace than [in] the Morne. xxi. Chloris enamoured. Amintas, now at last Thou art reuengd of all my rigor past; The scorning of the, softnesse of thy hart, Thy longings, causefull teares, Doe double griefe each day to mee impart. I am not what I was, And in my Miseries I thyne doe glasse; Ah! now in perfect yeares, E'r Reason could my coming harmes descrie, Made loues fond Taper flie, I burne mee thinkes in sweet &amp; fragrant flame: Aske mee noe more: Tongue hide thy Mistres shame. xxii. Regrat. In this Worlds raging sea Where many Sillas barke, Where many Syrens are, Saue, and not cast away, Hee onlye saues his barge With too much ware who doth it not o'recharge; Or when huge stormes arise, And waues menace the skies, Giues what he got with no deploring show, And doth againe in seas his burthen throw. xxiii. A sigh. Sigh, stollen from her sweet brest, What doth that marble hart? Smartes it indeed, and feales not others smart, Grieues it, yet thinkes that others grieued ieast? Loue or despight, which forct thee thence to part Sweet harbinger, say from what vncouth guest? Sure thou from loue must come, Who sighd to see there drest his marble Tombe. xxiv. Stollen pleasure. My sweet did sweetlie sleep, And on her rosie face Stood teares of pearle which Beauties selfe did weepe; I (wond'ring at her grace) Did all amazd remaine, When loue said, foole, can lookes thy wishes crowne? Time past comes not againe. Then did I mee bow downe, And kissing her faire brest, lips, cheekes, &amp; eies, Prou'd heere on earth the ioye of Paradise. xxv. Of a Kisse. Lips, double port of loue, Of joy tell all the arte, Tell all the sweetnesse lies In earthlie paradise, Sith happy now yee proue What blisse A kisse Of sweetest Nais can bring to the hart. Tell how your former joyes Haue beene but sad annoyes: This, onlye this, doth ease a long felt smart, This, onlye this, doth life to loue impart. Endymion, I no more Enuie thy happye state, Nor his who had the fate Rauisht to be and huggd on Ganges shore: Enuie nor yet doe I Adon, nor Joues cup-bearer in the skie. Deare crimson folds, more sweetnesse yee doe beare Than Hybla Tops or Gardenes of Madere. Sweet, sweetning Midases, your force is such, That eurye thing turnes sweet which yee doe touch. xxvi. A Locke desired. I neuer long'd for gold; But since I did thy dangling haire behold, Ah! then, then was it first That I prou'd Midas thrist; And what both Inde and rich Pactolus hold Can not my flames allay, For onlie yee, faire Treseresse, this may, Would yee but giue a locke to helpe my want, Of that which prodigall to winds yee grant. xxvii. Persuasive dissuading. Show mee not lockes of Gold, Nor blushing Roses of that virgine face, Nor of thy well-made leg and foote the Grace; Let me no more behold Soule-charming smyles nor lightnings of thyne eye, For they (deare life) but serue to make mee dye. Yes, show them all, and more; vnpine thy brest, Let me see liuing snow Where straw-berries doe grow; Show that delitious feild Which lillies still doth yeeld, Of Venus babe the Nest: Smyle, blush, sigh, chide, vse thousand other charmes; Mee kill, so that I fall betweene thyne armes. xxviii. [Prometheus am I] Prometheus am I, The Heauens my ladyes eye, From which I stealing fire, Find since a vulture on my hart to tyre. xxix. Non vltra. When Idmon saw the eyne Of Anthea his loue, Who yet, said he, such blazing starres hath seene, Saue in the heauens aboue? She thus to heare her praise Blusht, and more faire became. For nought (said he) thy cheekes that Morne do raise For my hart can not burne with greater flame. xxx. Fragment. [Now Phœbus vhept his horse vith al his might] Now Phœbus vhept his horse vith al his might, Thinking to take Aurora in her flight; But sche, vho heares the trampling of his steeds, Gins suiftlie gallop thruch heauens rosie meeds. The more he runs, the more he cums her neare; The lesse her sped, sche finds the more her feare. At last his coursiers angry to be torne, Her tooke; sche vith a blush died al the morne. Tethis, agast to spie her greens made red, All drousie rose furth of her corral bed, Thinking the Nights faire Queen suld thole sume harmes, Sche saw poor Tithons vyff in Phœbus armes. xxxi. Fragment. [It Autumne vas, and cheereful chantecleare] It Autumne vas, and cheereful chantecleare Had varn'd the vorld tuise that the day drew neare; The three parts of the night almost var spent, Vhen I poure vretch, vith loue &amp; fortune rent, Began my eies to close, &amp; suetest sleep, Charming my sence, al ouer me did creep, But scars vith Lethè drops &amp; rod of gold Had he me made a piece of breathing mold ...

At ease I red your Worke, and am right sorrye It came not forth before Encomium Morie, Or in the dayes when good king James the first Carowsd the Horses spring to quench his thirst; I durst haue giuen my Thombe and layed a wager Thy Name had grac't the chronicle of Jhon Maior. Had thou liu'd in the dayes of great Augustus, (Hence, vulgare dotards, hence, vnlesse yee trust vs) Thy Workes (with geese) had kept the Capitole, And thou for euer been a happy soule, Thy statue had been raisd neare Claudianus, And thou in court liu'd equall with Sejanus.

Let all that heare doe weare celestiall bonnetes Lyke thyne (they cannot write four-squared sonnetes) Which shine like to that Mummye brought from Venice, Or like the french kings relicks at Saint Denis. It is a matter of regrate and pittie Thou art not read into that famous citie Of Constantine, for then the Turckes and Tartares Had drunke with vs, and like to ours worne gartares; And the strange Muphetees and hard Mameluckes Had cut their beardes, and got by hart thy Bookes. If any them detract, though hee were Xenaphon, Thou shalt haue such reuenge as ere was tane of one, From this our coast vnto the Wall of China, Where Maides weare narrow shoes; thou hast been a Man for enuie, though such forsooth was Horace, Yet thou no lesse dost write than hee, and soare ass As farre in this our tongue as any Latines, Though some doe reade their verse, that ware fine satines; Romes latest wonder, great Torquato Tasso, Writing, to thee were a pecorious asse, hoe!

No Wonder now if Mistes beclowde our Day, Sith now our earth lakes her celestiall Ray; And Ph?bus murnes his preest, and all his quire, In sables wrapt, weep out their sacred fire; Far well of latin Muses greatest praise, Whither thou red graue proses or did raise Delight and wonder by a numbrous straine; Fare well Quintilian once more dead againe; With ancient Plautus, Martiall combined, Maro and Tullie, here in one enshrined. Bright Ray of learning which so cleare didst streame, Fare well Soule which so many soules did frame. Many Olympiades about shall come, Ere Earth like thee another can entombe. lix. D. O. M. S.

The Daughter of a king, of princelye partes, In Beautie eminent, in Vertues cheife, Load-starre of loue, and load-stone of all Hartes, Her freindes and Husbandes onlie Joy, now Griefe, Enclosed lyes within this narrow Graue, Whose Paragone no Tymes, no Climates haue. Maritus mœrens posuit. lxii. To the Memorie of ? As nought for splendour can with sunne compare For beautie, sweetnesse, modestie, ingyne, So shee alone vnparagon'd did shyne, And angelles did with her in graces share. Though few heere were her dayes, a span her life, Yet hath Shee long tyme liud, performing all Those actiones which the oldest doe befall, Pure, fruitfull, modest, Virgine, Mother, Wife. For this (perhaps) the fates her dayes did close, Her deeming old; perfection doth not last, When courser thinges scarce course of tyme can waste; Yeeres liues the worthlesse bramble, few dayes the Rose. Vnhappye Autumne, Spoyler of the flowres, Discheueler of Meades and fragrant plaines, Now shall those Monethes which thy date containes, No more from Heuens be nam'd, but Eyes salt showres. lxiii. To the Memorie of the worthye ladye, the ladye Craigmillare. This Marble needes no teares, let these be powr'd For such whom Earths dull bowelles haue emboured In chyld-head or in youth, and lefte to liue By some sad chance fierce planetes did contriue. Eight lustres, twice full reckened, did make Thee All this lifes happinesse to know; and wee Who saw thee in thy winter (as men flowres Shrunke in their stemmes, or Iliums faire towres Hidde in their rubbidge) could not but admire The casket spoyled, the Jewell so intiere; For neither judgment, memorye, nor sence In thee was blasted, till all fled from hence To thy great Maker; Earth vnto earth must, Man in his best estate is but best Dust. Now euen though buryed yet thow canst not dye, But happye liust in thy faire progenie To out-date Tyme, and neuer passe away. Till Angelles raise thee from thy Bed of claye, And blist againe with these heere loud thow meet, Rest in fames Temple and this winding sheet: Content thou liu'd heere, happye though not great, And dyed with the kingdome and the state. lxiv. D. O. M. S. What was mortall of W. Ramsay lieth heere. Hee was the Sonne of John Ramsay, L. of Edington, Brother to the right honorable William, the first earle of Dalhousye, a linage of all vertues in peace and valour in warre, renowned by all tymes, and second to none; a youth ingenuous, of faire hopes, a mild sweet disposition, pleasant aspect, countenance; his Kinreds delight and joy, now their greatest displeasure and sorrow; hauing left this transitorye Stage of cares, when hee but scarce appeared vpon it, in his tender nonage. So falles by Northern blast a Virgine rose, At halfe that doth her bashfull bosome close; So a sweet flowrish languishing decayes That late did blush when kist by Phoebus rayes. Though vntymelie cropp'd, leaue to bemoan his fate, Hee dyed with our Monarchie and State. His Mother out of that care and loue she caryed to him, to continue heere his memorie (some space) raised this Monument, Anno 1649, mense ... Immortale decus superis. Posthumous Poems. IV. ECLOGUES. i. Eclogue. [Damon and Moeris by a christal spring] Damon and Moeris by a christal spring Vher a greene sicamour did make a schade, And fairest floures the banckes all couering, Theer oft to stay the vandring Nymphes had made, Vhile voods musicians from the trees aboue On eurye branche did varble furth ther loue, On grassie bed all tyrd them selues did lay To schune suns heat and passe the tedious houres Delyting now to see theer lambkins play Then to veaue garlands for theer paramours. Damon tormentet vas with Amarillis And Moeris brunt in loue of farest Phillis. Phillis the louliest lasse that flockes ere fed By Tanais siluer streames, vhos heaunlie eie In chaines of gold this shephard captiue led, Or he knew vhat vas loue or libertie. Sweet Amarillis far aboue the rest Of Askloua maids estimed the best. In curious knotes vhile thay theer vorke adorne, Mixing pyed dezies with sad violets, Vhit lilies with that flour vhich like the morne Doth blush and beautie to the garland sets, Damon, vhom loue and voes had sore dismaid, Thus gan to say or Loue thus for him said. Faire Tanais Nymphes &amp; ye Nymphes of the voods Vhich usse in schadie groues to dance and sing, Ye Montaine sisters sisters of the floods On softest sand vhich oft ar carroling, Heere bring your flours and this garland make faire To set vpon my Phillis amber haire. Do not disdaine to be a schade, sweet flours, To fairest tresses vnder vhich doth grow The rose and lilie far excelling yours, The red cinabre and the milke vhit snow. About her temples vhen I sal yow place Them you can not (sweet flowres) they shall yow grace. Suouft vinged archers &amp; ye sea-borne queene, In Mirrhas child if yee tooke ere delight, If ere vith flames your hart hath touched beene, Enambushd lie you by this red &amp; vhit, That vhen her lockes this coronet anademe sal part, A hundred cupids may steal to her hart. Her hart then coldest Alpine yce more cold, Mor hard yet precious as the diamond, The noblest conquest that vith dart of gold Loue euer made since he culd shoot or vound. But he that fort not darring to essay Contents you vith her eies &amp; ther doth play. Nou Ceres tuise hath cut her yellow lockes, The swellow tuise the spring about hath brocht, Tuise hath ve vaind the yonglins of our flockes Since I alas vas forc't, &amp; al for naught, Be cruel her to cry, veep &amp; complaine Vnto this montaine, forrest, riuer, plaine. My flockes sem'd partneres of ther masters voe: The Bell-bearer the troupes that vsd to lead His vsuall feading places did forgoe, And lothing three-leu'd grasse hold vp his head; The valkes, the groues which I did hant of yore My fate and Phillis hardnesse seemd deplore. The goate-foote syluans vnder schadie trees Did solemnize the accents of my plent Vith grones, the vatrie Nymphes with veeping eies And vide spred lockes I oft haue seen lament. Among the rest a Nymphe sueet, vanton, gay, Rising aboue the streames thus hard I say. Phillis sueet honor of these suetest voods, Vert thou but pitiful as thow art faire, The vorthiest gem of al our Tanais floods; But as in beautie so in hardness rare To al these graces that so do grace the; Ah, learne to loue, &amp; no mor cruel be! The flowres, the gemmes, the mettales, all behold, The lambes, the doues, the gold spangl'd bremes in streames, Al thes be vorkes of loue; the Tygresse bold Made mild by loue her in-bred furie teames; In heauen, earth, aire, since all vhere loue we see, O, learne to loue, and no more cruel be! In toilesome paines to vast our virgin yeares And louelesse liue, is not to liue but breath; Loue is the tree vhich most contentment beares, Vhose fruits euen makes vs liue beyond our death; Sweet loue did make thy Mother bring forth thee; Ah, learne to loue, and no more cruel be! Earths best perfections doth but last short time, Riche Aprils treasure pleaseth much the eie, But as it grows it passeth in its prime. Thinke, &amp; vel thinke, thy beautie thus must dye; Vhen vith van face thow sal loke in thy glasse Then sal thow sigh: vould I had lou'd, alas! Looke but to Cloris louing lou'd againe, How glad, how merrillie, sche spends each daye, Like cherful vine vhom chaste elme doth sustaine, Vhile her sweet yonglings doe about her play; Vhen thow the vant sal find of such a grace Then sal thow sigh: vould I had lou'd, alas! But vho is Damon vhom thow suld disdaine: The heauens on him some gifts hath euen let fal; Gay is hee; vealth his cabane doth containe; He loues the much, &amp; that is more then al. If crueltie thy loue in him deface Then sal thow say: that I had lou'd, alas! Flora him lou'd, if ere in clearest brooke Narcissus like thy face thow did admire, As faire as thow, yet Flora he forsooke Vith al her gifts, &amp; foole did the desire. If he his thochts againe on Flora place Then sal thow sigh: vould I had lou'd, alas! This said the Nymphe, &amp; ther vith al sche sanke The clearest streame beneath, vho al dismaid At her depart come playning to the banke, And on his face a hundred frownes bevrayed. I lay as on vhom some strange dreame makes vake, Then homvard to my cabane did me take. The floods sal backvard to ther fontaines rune, The spring shall vant its floures, the pleasant floures On barren rockes sal grow depriu'd of sune, The sune sal leaue the heuens tuelue shining boures; Heuens vithout starres sal be, starres cease to moue, Ere euer I my Phillis leaue to loue. Pant my hart doth vhen I thinke on that day, That fatal day, vhen sche vith looshung haire And vhitest petticot in new borne may, To gather floures did to our meeds repaire, Vhile I did rest beneath an ancient oke, Caring for nocht but how to fead my flocke. I saw her rune and as sche ran me thocht The feilds about did smyle; beside the streames Then sat schee down, vhere sune to kisse her sought; But schee with vaile eclipsd his vanton beames. I hard her breath few vords, vith loue &amp; feare To vhich vinds, mountaines, voods, did leane their eare. Deceu'd perchance vith that most liulie hew, A bee did hurt her lip that mad her veep, And moisten cheeke &amp; chin with sweetest due, Vhich semed to fal, but Cupid did it keep; For vhen rebellious harts ganstands his dart He steeps it in these teares, &amp; then thay smart. Vithal sche rose, &amp; in vatrie floods glasse Angerlie mild the litil vound to looke, Her selff sche drest, but Kala co?ing vas Vho made her stay, &amp; so her mande sche tooke, Of golden vonderes to make poore the Mead, Vhile on her face my hungry eyes did feed. At sight of her plump lips blush did the rose, To see her vaines the violets grew paile, The Marigold her precious leaues did close, Amazd to find her haire so farre preuaile; The lilies in her hand apeard not vhit. Thus dazel'd vas my sight vith sueet delight. Ourchargd at last sche to her village vent, Leauing a thousand diuerse thoughts in mee Like ciuill foes tumultuouslie which vent All their best strenhtes till all enuasseld be. Then tyrd vith vo I laid me in my bed, Vher al the Nyt the Hyacynthe I red. Vhat vonder her sueet eies culd me beguile Vhich kendle desire then vhen thay vtter breath, And euen vhen sche vald froune yet seme to smile, Life promising vhen most thay threaten death! For these faire tuines I rather stil be sad Then by an others loue euen be made glad. ii. Eclogue. [Vhile dayes bright coachman makes our schadows schort] Syrenus. Montanus. Sy. Vhile dayes bright coachman makes our schadows schort, And panting rests him in his halff dayes course, Vhile gladder shephards giue them selues to sport, Let vs deare Montane rest vs by this source, Vher ve may stanche our thrist vith coldest streames, And vnder schade be fred of Phebus beames. M. Content am I; but since Syluanus left This earthlie round I neuer like that spring, The vearie place from me my ioyes hath reft, Vhen I behold vher he vas vont to sing, Syluane vell knowne, the honor of our voods, Vho made the rocks to heare &amp; stayed the floods. Sy. Bevaile not Syluane, since he is releu'd Of flesclie bonds and these our mortal toiles, Vith sad misfortunes now he is not grieuet. This earth is framd for deaths triumphing spoiles; The pleasant leaues, the suetest floures decayes, And fairest things doth last the fewest dayes. M. Th'enuyous heauens, befor the course of time Stole the from earth for to enrich theer spheares, Vhile scars thow flourish't in thy youthful prime, Filling our harts vith voe, our eies vith teares. Syren, for these deare dayes that heer thow spent, Stay not my grief but help me to lament. Sy. If floods of teares from the elysian plaine Culd call a happie gost, if sights culd giue A sparke of lyff, then Phillis schoures of raine And lasting grones might make him yet to liue. Yet in remembrance of this orphane place, And her Il murne, Il sing vith the a space. M. A streame of teares, poore riuer christalline, Len these mine eies; so may along thy banks Sueet roses, lilies, &amp; the columbine, In pleasant flourish keep theer statlie ranks, To vash Syluanus Tombe, that of my sorrow The floods, the hils, the mids, a part may borrow. Sy. Len me the voice that Boreas hath the giuen, Stracht reachet pin, vhen he his blows redoubles; So may thy loftie head mont vp to heauen, &amp; neare heareefter feare his angry troubles, That my sad accents may surpasse the skies, &amp; make heuens echoes answer to my cries. M. Forests since your best darling now is gone, Vho your darke schadows suetnet vith his layes, Teache al your nightingales at once to grone, Cut your greene lockes, let fal your palmes &amp; bayes, Let not a mirtil tree be in yow found, But eurie vher vith cypress sad abound. Sy. Faire Midows from vhose tender bosome springs The vhite Narcissus, Venus deare delight, The Hyacinth, &amp; others vho var kings And ladies faire vhen thay enioyd this light, In mourning blake your princely coulours die, Bow downe your heads, vhile sighing zephires flee. M. Vhat now is left vnto this plane but veeping? This litil flood that sometime did inuite Our vearied bodies to sueet rest and sleeping, Vith his soft murmur semes to vaile our plight, Telling the rocks, the banks, vheer ere he goes, &amp; the vyde ocean, our remedlesse voes. Sy. As Philomela sight vpon a tree, Me thocht (for vhat thinks not a troublet mynd?) Vith her old grieues, amids her harmonie, Syluanus death, our losse, sche oft combind, Vherto tuo vidow turtles lent theer eares, Syne planed that Nature had not giuen them teares. M. The earth althocht cold vinter kil her flowres, And al her beautie eurie vher deface, Vhen Phebus turnes into his hoter boures, Made ful of lyff smiles vith her former grace; But so soone as, alas, mans giuen to death, No sunne againe doth euer make him breath. Sy. The Moone that sadlie cheers the gloomie night, Vhen sche in deaths blake armes a vhile remaines, New borne doth soone recev her siluer light And queenlike glances or the silent plaines; The stars sunke in the vest again doth rise; But man, forgot, in vglie horror lies. M. Ah souueraine poures, vhen ye did first deuise To make poore man, vhy brak ye not the molde? Vith fleschie maskes vhy did ye sprits disguyse? Caussing a glasse so foole that liquor hold, Vith cryes &amp; paine him bringing to the light, Happie t'haue sleepe in a eternal night. Sy. Happie t'haue sleepe in a eternal night &amp; neuer interrup that silent rest, He felt no voes if he had no delight, He did not know vhat's euil, of nocht vhat's best; If he vsd not th'vnperfyt piece of reason, He feard not voes to come at eurie season. M. If that I var againe for to be framd, &amp; that the heuens vald freelie to me giue Vhat of the things below I suld be made, A hart, a doue, I rather choose to liue, Then be a man, my losses stil lamenting, Tost first with passion, then vith sore repenting. Sy. If I var one of yow my sille lambes, I suld not beene oprest vith th'vncuth caire That mankind hath, nor felt the cruel flames Of Phillis eies, nor knowne vhat vas despaire: Sueet harmlesse flocke, vhen as ye stray alone, Ar ye affraid of Styx or Phlegeton? M. The mids ar not embled vith so manie floures, So many hews heuens doth neuer borrow, So many drops hath not the april schoures, As ve poore vretchet men hath vorlds of sorrow: For these, o glorious gifts of noble skies, Vith bitter teares ye fillet hath our eies. Sy. Vith bitter teares ye fillet hath our eies, And fostreth vith beguiling hope our mind Vith promist good that doth vs stil intice: Lo, seeke ve ve vot not vhat, and so mad blind Ve follow lies and change to taste of ioyes, But hauing changd ve find but new annoyes. M. If lies bred ioyes and vertue bring voe, Fals thochts be ful of comfort, trewth of sadnesse, Velcome braue lies of that I neuer know! Vnhappie trewth to take from me my gladnesse; For thocht ve veep our voes ve cannot mend them, &amp; ve may end our selues befor ve end them. SONNETS AND MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. iii. In S?. P. d. R. Great Paragon, of Poets richest Pearle, Beneath the artick circles statlie pole Abut quoes point the sphears of knouledge role, The magnes of al mynds, ear-charming Mearle; The perfumd cabinet quher muses duel, Enameling neu-found skyes vith starres of gold, Quher Pallas vith the free-borne queens enrold, And beutie, stryffs it selff for to excel. Farre-virthier Orpheus then they quho suel Vith sacred Pegasus azure streames, Or he quho brocht from Heauen the fyrie beames: Mor fit for Ph?bus Bay then Phebus sel. Thy perfyt praises if the vorld vold vrit Must haue againe thy selff for to end it. iv. [Faire cruel Siluia since thow scornes my teares] Faire cruel Siluia since thow scornes my teares, And ouerlookes my cares vith carelesse eie; Since my requests in loue offends thy eares, Hensefoorth I vowe to hold my pace in thee and die. But vhile I hold my pace thes things sal crie: The brookes sal murmure, &amp; the vinds complaine; The hils, the dails, the deserts vher I lie, Vith Echoes of my plents sal prech my paine. Yet put the case thay silent vald remaine; Imagine brookes &amp; vinds vald hold theer pace, Suppone hils, dailes, and deserts vald disdaine T'acquant thy deaff disdaines vith my disgrace; Yet vhile thay dombe, thow deaff, to me sal proue, My death sal speake and let the know my loue. v. [Great Queene whom to the liberall Heauens propine] Great Queene whom to the liberall Heauens propine All what their force or influence can impart; Whose Vertues rare, whose Beauties braue but art Makes thee aboue thy sacred sex to shine. Resembling much those Goddesses diuine; The thundrers Bride for thy heroicke hart, Cyther?a for proportion of each part, Joues braine-born gyrle for judgment and ingyne. But now I feare my flatrie flows to farre; Three Goddesses in one are rarelie seene, Nor can a goddesse be vngrate—you are. What rests then but, a Woman, and a Queene: A Woman in vnconstancie and change, A Queene because so statlie &amp; so strange. vi. De Porcheres, on the eies of Madame la Marquise de Monceaux, Thus englished. Wer these thine eies, or lightnings from aboue, Vhose glistring glances dazel'd so my sight? I tooke them to be lightnings send from Joue To threten that theer thunder bolt vald light. But lightnings culd not lest so long so bright. Thay rather semed for to be suns, vhose rayes Promou'd to the Meridian of theer might, Did change my noisome nights in joyful dayes. But euen in that theer nomber them bevrayes Suns ar thay not: the vorld endures but one. Theer force, theer figure, &amp; theer coulour sayes That thay ar heuens; but heuens on earth ar none. Be vhat thay vil, theer poure in force agrees: The heauns, the sune, the lightnings, and her eies. vii. [Ah! eyes, deare eyes, how could the Heuens consent] Ah! eyes, deare eyes, how could the Heuens consent To giue to you occasion of those teares? Brest, sugred Brest that Globes of Beautie beares, With sighes why should yee swell—with teares be sprent? Hair, that in spight of griefe art excellent, What haue you done? That hand you wronglie teares; Voice, through deare portes of pearle and rubies sent, Why should yee moane? mor fit to tune heauens spheares. Foule Grief, the scourge of life, from heauen exild, Child of Mishap, the Hells extreame disgrace, Brother to paine, Mans weaknesse, forster child, How did thou mount to so diuine a place? Yet Grief, come there, so stranglie she thee furmes, That thou seemst Joy, while shee thus sweetlie murnes. viii. To my Ladye Mary Wroath. For beautye onlye, armd with outward grace, I scorne to yeeld, to conquerre, or to striue; Let shallow thoughtes that can no deeper dyue, As fits their weaknesse, rest vpon a face. But when rare partes a heunlye shape confines, Scarce reacht by thoughtes, not subiect to the sight, Yet but the lanterne of a greater light, Wher worth accomplisht crownd with glorie shines, Then when bright vertue raignes in beautyes throne, And doth the hart by spirituall magick moue, Whilst reasone leads though passiones follow loue, Lothd may hee be that likes not such a one. If it not lou'd so braue a mynd thus shown, I hated had the basenesse of myne own. ix. [Our faults thy wrath deserued haue, alas!] Our faults thy wrath deserued haue, alas! And thou must craue iust count of eurye deed; But if our faults their punishment doe passe, Thy Goodnesse farre our errors doth exceed. All, all crye mercye, chargd with grief &amp; teares, A iust remorse orthrowing wylier powers; Reason can not effect in many yeeres What thy great wisdome can in few short howres. Passed ills wee see the present murne, Stand fearfull &amp; amazd of what should come, Euen those hidden fires eternaly that burne; For wretched life deserueth such a doome. But loue to vs a ray send from thy face, And after open wyde the Gates of Grace. x. [Or the vinged boy my thochts to the made thral] Or the vinged boy my thochts to the made thral, When babie-like I knew not vhat vas loue, My vit embrasing al my vit could proue, At others lacing, fearing not my fal, Vith two faire eies vher Cupids mother smyld, Thow oft inuited me to venter boldlie, As if my sad lookes spake minds langage coldlie, Til vith thes gleames in end I vas beguild. But free thow kneust I vas no more mine awne, Charmed in thes circles vher I forc'st remaine; Churlish thow doth thy vonted smyles retaine, And, voe is me! giues oft a cruel frowne. Alas! if loue in lookes hath made such change, Vnkind I loue the not but yet am strange. xi. Essay out of the Italien. Melpomene in Athenes neuer song More sueter accents, nor a more sad dittie, Nor neare made harts bleed vith a greater pitie, Vhere Tyber playes his floury banks along, Then vhen she veeping daigned by Forth to sing, Forth vhere thy heuenlie suannet loues to dwel, Forth that may claime the name of that faire vel Vhich Horses haue from flintie rocke mad spring. But Medwaye, Seuern, Tames vil not consent. To Monarks fals if y'il not giue such praise, Yet grant at least to them, in sueet sad layes Vho help faire Sions virgins, to lament. And if these trumpets yeilds not schrillest sounds, Forth boasts of him vho song the Turquish vounds. xii. To Anne, the french Queen, new come from Spaine, and applyable to Marye of England, meeting the King at Douer. At length heere shee is: wee haue got those bright eyes. More shine now our earth than the skyes! And our Mars, happye in his high desire, Is all flame by this fire. The spheeres in so heunlye face neuer fixed High state with so meeke graces mixed, Which in all harts about it round inspires True respect &amp; chast fires. At length both are met: our designes crowned are; Each soule in the ioy hath a share; May in both brestes this Isle of Vnion giue Onlye one hart to liue! xiii. Fragment. [Like vnto her nothing can be namd] Like vnto her nothing can be namd: The mold is broke vherin dear sche vas framd. Vho may of her rare beautie count ich part, And all these gifts heauen doth to her impart, On Affricke shores the sand that ebs &amp; flows, The skalie flockes that vith old Proteus goes, He sur may count, and al these vaues that meet To vashe the Mauritanian Atlas feet— Her curlet haire, faire threeds of finest gold, In nets &amp; curious knots mens harts to hold, Her forhead large &amp; euen of vhich the lilies Do borrow beautie &amp; the daffadilies, Faire ebaine bows aboue her heunlie eies, Vher tratrous loue in silent ambush lies, Vell framd her nose, her cheekes vith purest red, Cinabre like, most dantelie ar spred, Prettie &amp; schort her eares, vith heunlie smiles Her visage schind that sadest eies beguiles, To orient perles her teeth do nothing yeild, Nor lips to coral, or of gueles a feild; Juno vith maiestie, &amp; faire aurore, Vith blush &amp; fingers did this sueet decore; The Graces gaue theer smiles &amp; did reioice To heare her sing vith Phebus heaunlie voice, Pallas gaue vit, the vertews gaue theer part: Liuing the heauen thay loget in her hart. xiv. Fragment. [A faire, a sueet, a pleasant heunlie creature] A faire, a sueet, a pleasant heunlie creature Lycoris vas—the miracle of Nature: Her haire more faire then gold of Tagus streames Or his that cheeres the vorld vith golden beames, Her suetest mouth &amp; lips that halff shee closes Did nothing yeild to corral &amp; fresh roses, Her brow more vhite, more beautiful &amp; gay Then is a day but clouds in mids of May, Vnder the vhich tuo equal planets glancing Cast flames of loue, for loue theer stil is dancing; Vhile jurie, vith a dantiest purple spred, Of her faire cheks resembld the fairest red; Her nek semd framd by some most curious master, Most vhite, most smoth, a piece of alabaster; Vpon her brest two aples round did grow, Vith tops of strawberries more vhite then snow: So far in grace sche did excell each other That Cupid vald haue taine her for his mother. xv. To my ladye Mary Wroath. Who can (great lady) but adore thy name To which the sacred band are bound to bow. Of men your vncle first, of woemen yow, Both grace this age, &amp; it to both giues fame. Your spacious thoughts with choice inuentiones free, Show passiones power, affectiones seuerall straines; And yet one sort, and that most rare remaines, Not told by you, but to be proud by me. No face at all could haue my hart subdued, Though beautyes Sune in the Meridian shind; Yet by the glorye lightning from a mynd, I am her captiue whom I neuer knew. Sprightes wanting bodyes are not barrd from loue, But feele, not tuching; see, though wanting eyes; Aboue grosse senses reach true vertue flyes, And doth by sympathye effectuall proue. Then wonder not to see this flame burst forth, Nor blame mee not who dare presume so much; I honor but the best, and hold you such; None can deserue &amp; I discerne your worth. In spight of fortune though you should disdaine, I can enjoy this fauour fate assignes; Your speaking portrait drawn with liuing lines, A greater good than louers vse to gaine. My loue may (as begune) last without sight, And by degrees contemplatiuly grow; Yet from affection curious thoughtes most flow: I long to know whence comes so great a light, And wish to see (since so your spright excelles) The Paradise where such an Angell dwelles. MADRIGALS AND EPIGRAMS. xvii. [Loue once thy lawes] Loue once thy lawes I did rebellious blame, When they did cause My chastest hart to flame With fruitlesse vaine desire Of her, who scorneth both thy dartes &amp; fire. But now (iust Loue) Thee and thy lawes I free, And doe reproue My selfe, since plaine I see The best but worthye is To couuet, not enjoye such blisse. xviii. Of Anthea. When Hylas saw the eyne Of Anthea his loue, Who e're (said hee) such burning lampes hath seene, Vnlesse in Heauen aboue? Shee at his sillie praise With blush more faire became. In vaine (said hee) cheekes [in] skies that Morne do raise, For my hart can not feele a greater flame. xix. [In ashe her lies the wanton God of loue] In ashe her lies the wanton God of loue, By her whom for I die. For longtyme hauing hee Bent all his powres her marble hart to moue, In spight of dart of gold And torch of heunlye fire That neere would know desire, Nay what is strange more harder grew &amp; cold, Hee dowbting if the flame vnquencht remand the same, Wherwith hee heuen &amp; earth did burne of old, Proud on him selfe his brandones force, Which, ere hee wist, consumd his litle corse. xx. On a lamp. Faithfull and loued light That silent sees our thefts, Be glad at the sweet sound of kisses sweet. Oh! doe not dye! but if thou lou'st to die, Dye amidst our delight When languish both our brests. So, thou mayst dye at ease; For lamps to mee, no starres, are her faire eyes. xxi. Amarillis to her dog Perlin. Faire Perlin doe not barke, Poore foole dost thou not know My louer, my desire? If thou dost turne my fow, Who to mee shall be true? Thou neare shall after any kisses haue. Ist not enough all day That thou do with mee stay? Giue place to night, and like her silent bee, Lulld with the noyse that kisses make to thee. xxii. [This Monument vnder] This Monument vnder Doth lie the wonder Of that faire brest which Loue dar'd neuer tuch. His courage kill'd him; but was it not much A flea should bold and naked without armes Of Loueres wronged thus reuenge the harmes? Amantes proprio aere Militi bene merenti posuere. xxiii. [The Gods haue heard my vowes] The Gods haue heard my vowes; Fond Lyce those faire Browes Wont scorne with such disdaine My Loue, my teares, my paine. But now those springtide Roses Are turned to winter poses, To Rue &amp; tyme &amp; sage, Fitting that shriueled age. Now, youthes with hote desire, See, see, that flamelesse fire, Which earst your hartes so burned, Quicke into ashes turned! xxiv. On the lut of Margarite. The harmonie vherto the heauens doe dance, Keeping to curious notes a suoft cadance, Nor al Joues quiristers ar not so suet As is the voice &amp; lut of Margarite. If angry vith his sheares he had vndoone thee, Her onlie voice vald serue againe to tune thee; If he phlegrean squadrons vald bring vnder, Her lut vald combat better then his thunder. xxv. [If it be trew that Echo doth remaine] If it be trew that Echo doth remaine Mong hardest rockes, alas Calling so oft for Grace To her hard hart, vhy anser'st not againe? Vhile vinds and tempests blow The Echoes silent ar, And neuer answer: sounds are sent to far. So, troublet vith thy stormes of loue and voe, Or distant then vhen most thy griefe doth flow, Sche doth no answer giue. Yet this thow may beleaue That silence ofter is aye then no. xxvi. [Idas to schune sunnes beames] Idas to schune sunnes beames Did soume in cristal flood. Perchance, like faire Aurore, At Ganges bankes Phillis came to the schore.

Now, Tyme, haste, make her old: In siluer turne her lockes, her face like gold. xxviii. Epitaph. Heere lyes a Docter who with droges and pelfe Could not corrupte Death, but dyed himselfe. xxix.

Vntymlie Death that neither wouldst conferre, Discourse nor parley with our great Treasurer, Had thou beene as hee was or one of his tribe, Thou wouldst haue spar'd his life &amp; tane a Bribe. Hee who so long with gold &amp; subtil wit, Had iniurd strong law &amp; almost conquerd it, Hee who could lenthen causes and was able To sterue a suiter at the counsel Table, At lenth not hauing euidents to show, Was faine (Good lord) to take's Death. It was so. xxxvi. [Mops gaue his fath to Anne and Helen, yet doth ow] Mops gaue his fath to Anne and Helen, yet doth ow: Quho sayes good Mopsus hath no fath he lies, for he hath tuo. xxxvii.

VIL: DRUMMONDS LINES ONE THE BISCHOPES: 14 APPRYLL 1638.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Doe all pens slumber still, darr not one tray In tumbling lynes to lett some pasquill fly?

Thesse hounds they haue ingaged him one the stage Of Sharpe-eyed Europe, nay, ther's not a page Bot thinks he may laugh freily quhen he sees Kings Buffons acte, and Bischopes Tragedies. Should aney dauly with the lyons paw, Then knou a distance, Se[r]pents stand in aw. Naye, pray you Heauens, once lend me bot your thunder, Ile crusch and teare thesse sordid slaues assunder, And leuell with the dust ther Altars horne, With the lascivious organs, pieties scorne; Or lett me be as king, then of their skine Ile causse dresse lether and fyne Marikin, To couer coatches (quher they wount to ryde) And valk in bootes and shoes made of ther hyde, Vhipe them at neighbour princes courts to show, That No Nouations Scotts zeall can allow. I sacrefisse vold such presumtious slaues To my deir people, beat to dust the knaues, Then of the pouder of ther bons to dray The hare and pereuige to the popes lackay. I noblie should resent and take to heart Thesse pedants pryde that make poore Brittane smart, Confound the church, the stait, and all the nation With appish fooleries and abomination, Leaues churches desolate, and stopes the mouth Of faithfull vatchmen quho dare preach bot treuth; Incendiary fyrebrands, whosse proud wordes Drope blood, and sounds the clattring Noysse of Suordis. Had I bot halffe the spyte of Galloway Tom, That Roman snakie viper, I'd fall from Discreitter lynes, and rube ther itching eare With Spanish Nouells: bot I will forbeare. Becausse my foster and my amorous quill Is not yet hard, proud pasquills to distill, I doe intreat that droll Johne de Koell To sting them with satyres hatcht in hell; Each doge chyde thesse tabacco breathed deuyns, Each pen dairt volums of acutest lynes, And print the shame of that blacke troupe profaine In liuid vords, with a Tartarian straine. Since I a Louer am, and know not how To lim a Satyre in halffe hyddeous hew, Lyke to polypragmatick Macheuell, In pleasant flame (not stryffe) I loue to duell.

III. HYMNS. i. Hymn.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Him whom the Earth, the Sea, and Sky] Him whom the Earth, the Sea, and Sky Worship, adore, and magnify, And doth this threefold Engine steer, Mary's pure Closet now doth bear. Whom Sun and Moon, and Creatures all, Serving at Times, obey his Call; Pouring from Heaven his Sacred Grace, I' th' Virgin's Bowels hath ta'ne Place. Mother most blest by such a Dower, Whose Maker, Lord of highest Power, Who this wide World in Hand contains, In thy Womb's Ark himselfe restrains. Blest by a Message from Heaven brought, Fertile with Holy Ghost full fraught; Of Nations the desired King, Within thy Sacred Womb doth spring. Lord, may Thy Glory still endure, Who born wast of a Virgin pure; The Father's and the Sp'rit's of Love, Which endless Worlds may not remove. ii. An Evening Hymn.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Maker of all, we Thee intreat, Before the joyful Light descend, That Thou with wonted Mercy great Us as our Keeper would'st defend. Let idle Dreams be far away, And vain Illusions of the Night; Repress our Foe, least that he may Our Bodies to foul Lust incite. Let this, O Father, granted be, Through our dear Saviour's boundless Merit, Who doth for ever Live with Thee, Together with the holy Spirit. iii. Complaint of the Blessed Virgin.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The Mother stood with Grief confounded, Near the Cross; her Tears abounded While her dear Son hanged was, Through whose Soul, her Sighs forth venting, Sadly mourning and lamenting, Sharpest Points of Swords did pass. O how sad and how distress'd, Was the Mother ever-bless'd, Who God's only Son forth-brought: She in Grief and Woes did languish, Quaking to behold what Anguish To her noble Son was wrought. iv. Hymn upon the Nativity.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Christ, whose Redemption all doth free, Son of the Father, who alone Before the World began to be, Didst spring from Him by Means unknown; Thou his clear Brightness, thou his Light, Thou everlasting Hope of all, Observe the Prayers which in Thy Sight Thy Servants through the World let fall. O dearest Saviour, bear in Mind That of our Body Thou a Child Didst whilom take the natural Kind, Born of the Virgin undefil'd. This much the present Day makes known, Passing the Circuit of the Year, That thou from thy high Father's Throne The World's sole Safety didst appear. The highest Heaven, the Earth, and Seas, And all that is within them found, Because he sent Thee us to ease, With mirthful Songs his Praise resound. We also who redeemed are With Thy pure Blood from sinful State, For this thy Birth-Day will prepare New Hymns this Feast to celebrate. Glory, O Lord, be given to Thee Whom the unspotted Virgin bore, And Glory to Thee, Father, be, And th' holy Ghost for ever more. v. Hymn upon the Innocents.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Hail, you sweet Babes, that are the Flowers, Whom (when you Life begin to taste,) The Enemy of Christ devours, As Whirlwinds down the Roses cast. First Sacrifice to Christ you went, Of offer'd Lambs a tender Sort; With Palms and Crowns you Innocent Before the sacred Altar sport. vi. Dedication of a Church.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Jerusalem, that place Divine, The Vision of sweet Peace is nam'd, In Heaven her glorious Turrets shine, Her Walls of living Stones are fram'd, While Angels guard her on each Side, Fit Company for such a Bride. She deckt in new Attire from Heaven, Her Wedding-Chamber now descends, Prepar'd in Marriage to be given To Christ, on whom her Joy depends. Her Walls wherewith she is inclos'd, And Streets are of pure Gold compos'd. The Gates adorn'd with Pearls most bright The Way to hidden Glory show; And thither by the blessed Might Of Faith in Jesus's Merits go All these who are on Earth distrest, Because they have Christ's Name profest. These Stones the Work-men dress and beat, Before they throughly Polisht are, Then each is in his proper Seat Establisht by the Builder's Care, In this fair Frame to stand for ever, So joyn'd that them no Force can sever. To God, who sits in highest Seat, Glory and Power given be, To Father, Son, and Paraclete, Who reign in equal Dignity; Whose boundless Power we still adore, And sing their Praise for ever-more. vii. Hymn.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Jesv, our Prayers with Mildness hear] Jesv, our Prayers with Mildness hear, Who art the Crown which Virgins decks, Whom a pure Maid did breed and bear, The sole Example of her Sex. Thou feeding there where Lillies spring, While round about the Virgins dance, Thy Spouse dost to Glory bring, And them with high Rewards advance. The Virgins follow in thy Ways Whithersoever thou dost go, They trace thy Steps with Songs of Praise, And in sweet Hymns thy Glory show. Cause thy protecting Grace, we pray, In all our Senses to abound, Keeping from them all harms which may Our Souls with foul Corruption wound. Praise, Honour, Strength, and Glory great To God, the Father, and the Son, And to the holy Paraclete, While Time lasts, and when Time is done. viii. Hymn.The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Benign Creator of the Stars] Benign Creator of the Stars, Eternal Light of faithful Eyes, Christ, whose Redemption none debars, Do not our humble Prayers despise: Who for the state of Mankind griev'd, That it by Death destroy'd should be, Hast the diseased World reliev'd, And given the Guilty Remedy. When th' Evening of the World drew near, Thou as a Bridegroom deign'st to come Out of thy Wedding-Chamber dear, Thy Virgin Mother's purest Womb. To the strong Force of whose high Reign All Knees are bow'd with Gesture low, Creatures which Heaven or Earth contain, With Rev'rence their Subjection show. O holy Lord, we thee desire, Whom we expect to judge all Faults, Preserve us, as the Times require, From our deceitful Foes Assaults. Praise, Honour, Strength, and Glory great To God, the Father, and the Son, And to the holy Paraclete, Whilst Time lasts, and when Time is done. ix. Hymn for Sunday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. O blest Creator of the Light, Who bringing forth the Light of Days With the first Work of Splendor bright, The World didst to Beginning raise; Who Morn with Evening joyn'd in one, Commandedst should be call'd the Day; The foul Confusion now is gone, O hear us when with Tears we Pray; Lest that the Mind with Fears full fraught, Should lose best Life's Eternal Gains, While it hath no Immortal Thought, But is inwrapt in sinful Chains. O may it beat the inmost Sky, And the Reward of Life possess; May we from hurtful Actions fly, And purge away all Wickedness. Dear Father, grant what we intreat, And only Son who like Power hast, Together with the Paraclete, Reigning whilst Times and Ages last. x. Hymn for Monday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Great Maker of the Heavens wide, Who, least Things mixt should all confound, The Floods and Waters didst divide, And didst appoint the Heavens their bound; Ordering where heavenly Things shall stay, Where Streams shall run on earthly Soyl, That Waters may the Flames allay, Least they the Globe of Earth should spoil; Sweet Lord, into our Minds infuse The Gift of everlasting Grace, That no old Faults which we did use May with new Frauds our Souls deface. May our true Faith obtain the Light, And such clear Beams our Hearts possess That it vain Things may banish quite, And that no Falshood it oppress. Dear Father, grant what we intreat, etc. xi. Hymn for Tuesday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Great Maker of Man's earthly Realm, Who didst the Ground from Waters take, Which did the troubled Land o'rewhelm, And it unmoveable didst make, That there young Plants might fitly spring, While it with golden Flowers attir'd Might forth ripe Fruit in Plenty bring, And yield sweet Fruit by all desir'd; With fragrant Greenness of thy Grace, Our blasted Souls of Wounds release, That tears foul Sins away may chase, And in the Mind bad Motions cease: May it obey thy heavenly Voice, And never drawing near to Ill, T' abound in Goodness may rejoyce, And may no mortal sin fulfil. Dear Father, etc. xii. Hymn for Wednesday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. O holy God of heavenly Frame, Who mak'st the Pole's high Center bright, And paint'st the same with shining Flames, Adorning it with beauteous Light; Who framing on the fourth of Days The fiery Chariot of the Sun, Appoint'st the Moon her changing Rays, And Orbs in which the Planets run, That Thou might'st by a certain bound, 'Twixt Night and Day Division make, And that some sure Sign might be found To shew when Months Beginning take; Men's Hearts with lightsome Splendor bless, Wipe from their minds polluting spots, Dissolve the Bond of Guiltiness, Throw down the Heaps of sinful Blots. Dear Father, etc. xiii. Hymn for Thursday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. O God, whose Forces far extend, Who Creatures which from Waters spring Back to the Flood dost partly send, And up to th' Air dost partly bring; Some in the Waters deeply div'd, Some playing in the Heavens above, That Natures from one Stock deriv'd May thus to several Dwellings move; Upon thy Servants Grace bestow, Whose Souls thy bloody Waters clear, That they no sinful Falls may know, Nor heavy Grief of Death may bear; That Sin no Soul opprest may thrall, That none be lifted high with Pride, That Minds cast downward do not fall, Nor raised up may backward slide. Dear Father, etc. xiv. Hymn for Friday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. God, from whose Work Mankind did spring, Who all in Rule dost only keep, Bidding the dry Land forth to bring All kind of Beasts which on it creep; Who hast made subject to Man's Hand Great Bodies of each mighty Thing, That taking Life from thy Command, They might in Order serve their King; From us thy Servants (Lord) expel Those Errors which Uncleanness breeds, Which either in our Manners dwell, Or mix themselves among our Deeds. Give the Rewards of joyful Life, The plenteous Gifts of Grace encrease, Dissolve the cruel Bonds of Strife, Knit fast the happy League of Peace. Dear Father, etc. xv. Hymn for Saturday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. O Trinity, O blessed Light, O Unity, most principal! The fiery Sun now leaves our Sight, Cause in our Hearts thy Beams to fall.

To God the Father Glory great, And Glory to his only Son, And to the holy Paraclete, Both now and still while Ages run. xvi. Upon the Sundays in Lent.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Hymn. O merciful Creator, hear Our Prayers to Thee devoutly bent, Which we pour forth with many a Tear In this most holy Fast of Lent. Thou mildest Searcher of each Heart, Who know'st the weakness of our Strength, To us forgiving Grace impart, Since we return to Thee at length. Much have we sinned to our Shame, But spare us who our Sins confess; And for the Glory of thy Name, To our sick Souls afford Redress. Grant that the Flesh may be so pin'd By Means of outward Abstinence, As that the sober watchful Mind May fast from Spots of all Offence. Grant this, O blessed Trinity, Pure Unity, to this incline, That the Effects of Fasts may be A grateful Recompence for Thine. xvii. On the Ascension Day.The attribution of this poem is questionable. O Jesu, who our Souls dost save, On whom our Love and Hopes depend, God, from whom all Things Being have, Man, when the World drew to an end; What Clemency Thee vanquisht so, Upon Thee our foul Crimes to take, And cruel Death to undergo, That Thou from Death us free might make? Let thine own Goodness to Thee bend, That thou our Sins may'st put to Flight; Spare us, and as our Wishes tend, O satisfy us with Thy Sight. May'st Thou our joyful Pleasures be, Who shall be our expected Gain, And let our Glory be in Thee, While any Ages shall remain. xviii. Hymn for Whitsunday.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Creator, Holy Ghost, descend, Visit our Minds with thy bright Flame, And thy celestial Grace extend, To fill the Hearts which Thou didst frame: Who Paraclete art said to be, Gift which the highest God bestows, Fountain of Life, Fire, Charity, Oyntment whence Ghostly Blessing flows. Thy seven-fold Grace Thou down dost send, Of God's right Hand Thou finger art, Thou by the Father promised Unto our Mouths dost Speech impart. In our dull Senses kindle Light; Infuse thy Love into our Hearts, Reforming with perpetual Light Th' Infirmities of fleshly Parts. Far from our Dwelling drive our Foe, And quickly Peace unto us bring; Be thou our Guide, before to go, That we may shun each hurtful Thing. Be pleased to instruct our Mind, To know the Father and the Son, The Spirit who them both dost bind, Let us believe while Ages run. To God the Father Glory great, And to the Son who from the dead Arose, and to the Paraclete, Beyond all Time imagined. xix. On the Transfiguration of our Lord, the Sixth of August; A Hymn.The attribution of this poem is questionable. All you that seek Christ, let your Sight Up to the Height directed be, For there you may the Sign most bright Of everlasting Glory see. A radiant Light we there behold, Endless, unbounded, lofty, high; Than Heaven or that rude Heap more old, Wherein the World confus'd did lye. The Gentiles this great Prince embrace; The Jews obey this King's Command, Promis'd to Abraham and his race A Blessing while the World shall stand. By Mouths of Prophets free from Lyes, Who seal the Witness which they bear, His Father bidding testifies That we should Him believe and hear. Glory, O Lord, be given to Thee, Who hast appear'd upon this Day; And glory to the Father be, And to the Holy Ghost for ay. xx. On the Feast of St. Michael the Arch-Angel.The attribution of this poem is questionable. To Thee, O Christ, Thy Father's Light, Life, Vertue, which our Heart inspires, In Presence of thine Angels bright, We sing with Voice and with Desires: Our selves we mutually invite To Melody with answering Quires. With Reverence we these Souldiers praise, Who near the heavenly Throne abide, And chiefly him whom God doth raise His strong Celestial Host to guide, Michael, who by his Power dismays, And beateth down the Devils pride. V. TO THE READER.The attribution of this poem is questionable. No cankring Envy, Malice, nor Despite Stirr'd vp these men so eagerly to flyte, But generous Emulation; so in Playes Best actors flyte and raile, and thousand wayes Delight the itching Eare; So wanton Curres Walk'd with the gingling of a Courteours spurres, Barke all the night, and never seeke to bite: Such bravery these verses mov'd to write, Would all that now doe flyte would flyte like those, And Lawes were made that none durst flyte in prose; How calme were then the world? perhaps this Law Might make some madding wives to stand in aw, And not in filthy Prose out-roare their men: But read these Roundelayes to them till then. Flyting no reason hath, and at this tyme Heere it not stands by Reason, but by Ryme; Anger t'asswage, make Melancholy lesse, This flyting first was wrote, now tholes the Presse. Who will not rest content with this Epistle, Let him sit downe and flyt, or stand or whistle.</field>
