TO ROBERT SOUTHEY. TO ?. WRITTEN IN WORCESTERSHIRE, JULY 1797. Escap'd the jarrings of the restless crowd, Oh, my ?, I am well content To loiter here awhile! My spirit fails, And my heart aches when jostling with the crew Which (goaded to activity by pain, Or rous'd from squalid slowth and apathy By maniac wickedness) annihilates The soul's best attributes! The world to me Seemeth the prison-house of man, where Power And loathlier Wealth inflict on trembling slaves The rackings of despair! And Love, and Truth, And social Happiness, and meekest Peace From every beaten path are fled afar. Sometimes a glimpse of their sweet countenance Blesses the solitary man, who roves Musing 'mid Nature's silent majesty. And so beseems it nowâfor to my breast A mild assurance of predestin'd bliss Stole most refreshingly, and with strange calm Allay'd my feverish agonies of care, My ruffled spirits boding, and the pang Familiar to that heart which loveth not The ways of human kind! Yes, as I rov'd Adown that glade, above whose simple brook The inwoven thicket bends, and caught a gleam That from the unseen west'ring orb of day Stole faintly yellowing yon cowslip bank, Whose cool recess look'd quietness; each sense Slumbering in soft enchantment minist'red Its hallow'd workings to the lifted soul. Often in no uninterested mood I've told thee that there were of noble souls Who deem'd it wise, e'en in the morn of youth, To quit this world This alludes to a plan projected by S. T. Coleridge and Robert Southey, together with some common friends, of establishing a society in America, in which all individual property was to be abandoned.! (a scene in my poor thought Deliver'd over long by outrag'd Heaven To wasting fiends, and unrepenting guilt,) They counted still beyond the Atlantic deep To find those virtues, of whose sweets bereft The unearthly soul calleth its sojourn here A most impure enthralment! Oh my best friend, That I had liv'd in high-soul'd fellowship With such as fancy pictures these might be, Tried spirits, and unspotted from the world! But I must sicken thy awaken'd soul, Storying their blasted hopes! Yet, honour'd few, The seeds that ye have sown, the unworldly dreams, The lofty thoughts, disinterested loves, That ye have nurs'd, silently long shall work In beings unknown, regenerating thus Full many a guilt-vex'd mind, that, but for you, Had sunken in dismay (now animate With noblest emulation), and to truth Leavening each baser wish, shall perfect them! Yes! it shall rise again, your godlike scheme; And every fleshly lust, and every sin, Pampering the subtleties of selfish pride, Shall vanish swiftly, as the morning cloud, From its most holy influence; and all those, Who struggled with the spirit of this world, Shall come forth with unutterable joy, And (as with recognition of dear friends Long lost, and sought for) join the elect Wherever the word elect is used in the following pages, the authors by no means intend the arbitrary dogma of Calvinism. They are both believers in the doctrine of philosophical necessity, and in the final happiness of all mankind. They apply the word elect therefore to those persons whom secondary causes, under providence, have fitted for an immediate entrance into the paradisiacal state. of Heaven. Meanwhile, till I may find a brother heart, Stain not my soul with sin, ye tainted scenes That rise around! Oh keep me, gracious Heaven! That to the councils of the wicked ones I enter not! Man's strength is weakness; him It booteth most to feel that he is frail, And all, mistrusting wisdom self-deriv'd, Stand trembling at the gate where Sin doth dwell. Then let us, ?, watch aloof, Till the long night be past, that, so prepar'd, We, with the first redeem'd from this bad world, May hail the promis'd time, when pain and grief Shall be no more; of love and blessedness The hallow'd advent; and with unstain'd hands Circle the grassy altar which shall rise In every grove and mead, when equal man Shall deem the world his temple, to that God, Who destin'd all his creatures to be good, And who, with sympathies of holiest love, Shall teach best fellowship with kindred souls, Or loftier breathings of devoutest praise. WRITTEN AT BURTON IN HAMPSHIRE, AUGUST 1797. And I have turn'd away again from those Who beckon'd me to ruin! Hollow friends, Ye worldly ones, on whose unfaithful lip The vacant smile sits ever, I rejoice That you no more profane my honest name With supercilious tongue. 'Twere better far Not to be known or knowing, than to dwell With the hard bustlers of this wicked world! Whom shall I trust? for I have trusted many, And they have been most false! 'Tis true there are Who in the free convivial scene will ape, With most deceitful seeming, the full soul Of holiest virtue; and will sigh, or smile, As they her delicate vicissitudes Had keenly witness'd: but the ready mimic Plant in his proper station, and the thing (Though late so exquisitely organiz'd) Will stand the statue of obduracy, And scatter back, with strange inaptitude, Love's unadmissible radiance. Oh my God! Why is the fleshly heart so petrified? Why all its avenues clos'd, and the high swell Of infinite perfection disciplin'd To base manÅuverings, to the unnatural guilt Of intellectual murder? To repine It matters not; nor do my feelings prompt The coward weakness: for so tried am I, That if a kindly smile ne'er met my gaze, That if an accent of subduing love Did never more pierce my unwelcom'd ear, I think I could go onward undismay'd, And uncomplaining. I would wrap myself In holiest quiet; I would brood on years That have been happy; I would strive to think That the sincere pass on not unbeheld Of Him who knows the heart; and I would shape A happier future, a redeemed race, The retributions of a better world: Yea, all these thoughts should minister to me Till I were rich in friends! The noble soul Swells as the tempest thickens, and most feels Its own sufficiencies of happiness, Its plenitude of solitary strength, When all the puppetry of life's brief day Has done its business; when the dark night comes, And all is vacancy, or unshap'd gloom, Big with invisible perils. Bear me on, Blest consciousness of virtue; nor sometimes Let me not ponder on that Stoicism. elder lore Which shapes a world within, and thence derives (Supreme of blessings) the unbending will! Or if my truant fancy still must dwell On aught save its own workings, let it fly To unborn years, intensely imaging That blessed spectacle when self shall sink In the immensity of being, and God Be all in all. Here, ye wandering thoughts, Direct your workingsâHither, lingering hopes, Turn and be satisfied! Than such a calm, (Which steals when living in the days to come With blessed self-desertion, present ills, And present miseries, we annihilate) I dare not ask for more! Let Him who hears And weighs our supplications grant it me, If so seem good to his unerring will. UngrantedâI will struggleânot repine! [Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.] Burton, August 1797. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Through many tribulations ye shall enter the kingdom of heaven. Dishearten'd outcasts, wheresoe'er ye be, Who drag along the burden of a life, Whose uses all seem blasted; ye who look, And in the wide world's desolated round Meet with no heart that heeds, no friendly hands To work your glad deliverance: mournful ones, Be of good cheer, for he whose loves and hopes, Whose mortified desires are disciplin'd By bitter disappointment (e'en till all Or gross or bodily unsensualliz'd Waits on the spiritual) in better worlds Shall find it gain to have lost his being here. Methinks the sum of hopes and joys withdrawn From life's entanglements, doth manifest The measure of our confidence in Heaven. And for each mortal buffetting below A guerdon of unutterable price Shall there await us.âBear ye then your cross With inward quiet, ye despised ones! Cleans'd by the trespasses of those who fain Would vex your souls: turn ye their evil to good! Yea, all the enemies ye meet, transform'd By magic of unconquerable truth Of ministers of happiness (themselves Blind to the effect meanwhile) shall point away Miraculous, of high triumph; and refine Your spirits for the company of the just; The sabbath of your God; when hope, and fear, Or mortal change, shall vex the soul no more. When in this low state man begins to live, Though destin'd for a high career, a being Mysterious, incorporeal, infinite, He (shapeless embryo, whose future powers Slumber in nothingness to the unpurg'd eye) Is as the beasts who perish! Nor high Heaven, A thing so prone to earth, to sense, could raise, So prone to joys, which e'en the downward brute May share in common, save by trial of pain, And all the hard inflictions which correct Our carnal longings. These so fierce desires (Turbulent drudges to the better part) Furnish the active impulse, push us on To bold endeavour: but the end denied, The mean collects a store for future days Of feelings, thoughts, imaginations, (food For the infant reason) and with sense unblest Combines the loftier ardours of the soul. Thus e'en base lust the being may befriend Destin'd for high perfection, minist'ring New aims, exciting to activity, Most fortunate when most ungratified. These are the chasten'd strangers in this world, Loved For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. of God, who blasts, or ere obtain'd, The promis'd pleasure; thus transferring all Their disappointed feelings, blighted hopes, To the âdivine stability of Heaven.â And blest are they who meekly turn their cheeks To him who smites; who bend before the rod; Who in the furnace of affliction tried, Shall thence come forth, enduring to the end. TO A SISTER These lines are printed in Edmund Oliver, a tale, by the Author of these Poems.. Burton, August 1797. My Sister, often does my lonely heart Dwell on thy parting look, thy grasp of love! Dear girl, thou know'st with what a willing fondness I've watch'd thy opening mind; with how much warmth I've caught the unfolding sentiment, the wish Newly develop'd: I have listen'd to thee, And of thy innocent feelings have partook, E'en till I liv'd in thee, and melted down Years of past bitterness: and now unblest By all the hallow'd charities of home, By all those nameless offices of love Which never pass its bounds; treasures whose worth The mortal may not know, who sojourns not An alien from his kindred, I would fain Solace my spirit, imaging thy smiles, Thy kindly accents, thy mute eagerness To fill for me life's gnawing vacancies! But, ah! the thought how distant thou art from me Embitters the remembrance, turns the tear Of gentle sorrow to so hard a pang, I may not give it utterance. But mayst thou Live happy! And may he, whose shaping soul Had imag'd a stability of bliss This earth may never boast; may he prevent The sad experience that would supplicate That mourning one, that melancholy form Of dreariest Peace, which broods on Folly's grave. And with a fixedness of look, which tells That mortal hopes and fears have shaken her, Till all was blank, and they could work no more, Strikes a most deadly calm. May he, dear friend, His disappointments so transfer to thee, That they may hush each mortal restlessness; Yet mixt with somewhat of the sweet delight Which mingles with past griefs, rather subdue To a most enviable quiet, a mood Of meekest self-content, than numb the soul, Or freeze to apathy. Nor do not I Sometimes indulge the dream that we may meet, Beloved Sister, in some lowly shed, Far from the stir of men; and we will there Sum up each earthly peril; and if so, Our souls may win that holy confidence, Cheering the pure in heart; some natural tears Of no mean transport shall bedew our cheeks, And we will hallow to the Being that gave âThe mystery of lifeâ that blessed spot E'en till it seem a little heaven below. LINES TO THOMAS SOUTHEY, ON HIS LEAVING THE AUTHOR TO RESUME HIS SERVICE AS MIDSHIPMAN IN HIS MAJESTY'S SHIP MARS. September 19, 1797. Soon the sad hour will come, and we must part! I, not unmindful that âmy way of lifeâ Has past with thee most cheerily, full oft Shall offer for my friend, when far away, Affection's warm involuntary prayer! And I shall brood upon the days we spent Together, in the present time absorb'd, Heedless of parted ills, and ills to come. When on the silvery ocean we did sail, And gaz'd on either side the gradual The Hampshire coasts. slope Of freshest woodiness; and when each eye Glisten'd with joyance, as the downy hills, The hanging groves, the green and tufted vales, Of Vecta's isle Isle of Wight., pour'd on the beating heart Shapes of sweet character; or when we trod Those glens whose forest shade majestical Would ever and anon, as the gale past, Disclose the blue waves melting into air: What time we glided o'er the element, Or trac'd those beauteous scenes, what transport fill'd My swelling breastâthe voice of friend was heard With new emotion, and that thou wast there, When I would muse upon those pleasant days, I never can forget! But themes like these Suit not the present timeâThee duty calls A hard task to fulfillâto quit thy home, Thy peaceful home, and all the hallow'd ties Of brother, son, and friend! Instead of tones Soften'd and mellow'd by Affection's tongue, Instead of kindest looks, and promptest smiles, The tyrant voice of stern authority, Or the coarse greetings of a brutish rout, Must grate upon thine ear! I know it wellâ It must be hard to bear! But, at such times, âThink on thy absent friend;â in heaviness He too may struggle on his weary way. Living in future hours, when we may meet, Melt down the day's rude business, and the thought That may intrude, and force thy manly breast To wrestle with its heavings! Now, dear friend, Farewell, and prosper! Led in the right path; Which, save the All-powerful, All-wise Living One, None may presume to dictate to the soul. LINES TO A BROTHER. September 20, 1797. My Robert, since we met at that abode How many scenes I've trod; how many joys And griefs have swoln my breast! Thinking of thee, Dearest companion of my youthful hours, I have subdued hard disappointment's pang, Till it assum'd a shade so soft and sweet, That it seem'd like very comfort. Oftentimes Do I recall the days of infancy, When we did wander hand in hand, and shar'd Our tears and smiles, our tasks and sports, together. Thou, younger than myself, hast ever known How I have labour'd with a fervent zeal To discipline thy heart for the keen wrongs, The cruel buffettings that here await Man journeying heavenward! When passion's gust Or childhood's fitful pangs gnawing the breast, Have vex'd the better part, oft have we sought The lonely walk, and with sincerest love Pouring out all our troubles, every wo That ach'd within, have commun'd till our souls Mingled with kindliest yearnings, and have felt How sweet it is (pondering on the same path Of future life) to lose ourselves in one, A friend we dearly love! And surely thou Recall'st those moments when we frisk'd along That path so often trod (a path mine eye Dare hardly gaze on now) t' embrace the friend Whose most intelligible smiles of love Gather'd around her cherish'd dwelling-place The choicest hours of youth! I was not by When thou didst hear the tidings of her death! And oh, my Brother! with what hollow speech, With what misgiving, and averted looks, Must we conceal the dull heart's heaviness, When on that same spot we shall meet again! Enough!âWith grief's unprofitable pangs I would not wound thy breast: for in this world All grief is vain, which taketh not from guilt The hues of fascination. Thee I know Of tenderest soul; and I would not subdue Thy mind with the indolence that ever waits On pamper'd feeling, and the delicate train Of coward sympathies! Bear thou right on! Dream not of happiness, nor of the glow That fills the inebriate soul, and satisfies Its infinite cravings! The sweet consciousness Of rectitude support thee, and the thought That (in thy day fulfilling as thou mayst The work assign'd by thy great master) thou With sure feet pressest to perfection's goal! LINES ON PASSING A PLACE OF FORMER RESIDENCE. December 1796. I past my childhood's home, and, lo, 'twas dark! The night-wind whistled 'mid its leafless trees! No taper twinkled cheerily to tell That she had heap'd the hospitable fire, Spread the trim board, and with an anxious heart Expected me, her âdearest boy,â to spend With her the evening hour! Oh, no! 'twas gone, The friendly taper, and the warm fire's glow Trembling athwart the gloom! I listen'd long, Nor heard, save the unfeeling blast of night, Which chill'd my frame, or the sere ice-glaz'd twig That hoarsely rustled! 'Twas too muchâI wept! Then I bethought me she was coffin'd far Awayâentombed on the earth's cold lap! I look'd again; such thoughts were too, too true; For no ray glimmer'd! I did pass along Shivering, and bowed to earth with heaviness. WRITTEN THE 12TH OF FEBRUARY 1797. This is my natal day! To me the thought Awakens serious musings, and the sigh Of soften'd recollection. Heretofore This day has ne'er return'd, since manhood shap'd My wayward heart, not finding me the dupe Of feverish day-dreams, and the very slave Of hope's pernicious phantasies. This day Has ne'er return'd, not finding me possest Of her, whose parent-claims to love were lost In friendship's mightier attributes! Oh God, And I am doom'd this dark, dark day to know Those dreams, hope's phantasies, and my best friend, For ever gone! It boots not to complain; Therefore will I, with meek and bowed thoughts, Muse calmly on life's desolated path, As the way-wanderer, who the onward brack Gazes unanxious, though the bleak day fade, Though the wet winds sweep chilly, and the bark Of shepherd's watch-dog from the far-off hill Die on the gusty blast; if he reflect, That still in scenes remote a goodly home Awaits his wearied steps! Yes, so can I Look on life's waste with the composed smile Of resignation; tranquil in the hope That I may reach the abode where tears are wip'd From every eye, where the dear bury'd friend Shall recognize her long-bewilder'd child! Yet let me, as I travel on, if chance A pilgrim like myself cross the drear scene I needs must tread, mingle with his my tear For this bad world, beguile the little hour With what my spirit from its scanty store May spare, in kindliest sort to entertain One haply not unsuffering; then pursue My simple path, nor let the woes or joys Of weak, self-satisfied humanity, Break the long sabbath of my centred soul! Enough if I the vacant moment soothe With social intercourse! 'Tis not in man To fill the aching breast! My God, thou know'st How the heart pines that rests on human love! ADDRESS TO WEALTH. WRITTEN JULY 1797. Thou hateful Mammon, leave my loathing sight! I view in thee the murderer of those joys That satisfy the heart, with hard lean hand Clenching the steel which severs lastingly Humanity's best ties! Self-centring fiend! Thou sealest every eye, lest any more It catch the charms of nature, or perceive The vivid movements of the human soul Pourtray'd in fleshly characters; thou numb'st The nerve that throbb'd so finely to the grasp Of generous friendship, or of 'witching love The more intense embrace; quenchest the glow Of wide benevolence; mock'st her holy schemes Of amplest bliss, and on her very lip Freezest the mellow sigh, just risen to soothe A passing wretched one! I hate thee, Mammon! I hate thy servants; hate them, Heaven, as those Who counteract thy plans! To me, methinks, 'Twere well to humanize the heart, t' expand The active soul, t' embrace, with one wide wish, The universe, and move (uncentred here) As he that travels to a better world! One infinite, benevolent, and wise, Works through extended space, and we but live, Living in him! Learn then, my soul, to look With indefatigable gaze to God; And struggle (aye, annihilating self) To view the bearings of the complex whole From him, and with him. This is the best aim, The perfect triumph of redeemed man!</field>
