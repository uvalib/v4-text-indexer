      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. When I was yet a child, no childish play To me was pleasing; all my mind was set Serious to learn and know, and thence to do What might be public good. Milton. THE EXODUS OF THE FAIRIES. In Allan Cunningham's edition of Burns, he prettily says, that about seventy years ago, the Fairies, in a body, left Scotland; and it is certain that about that time the great agricultural improvements of Ayrshire were introduced. The poem is a description of the Exodus. Within a lone green hazel glen The Fairy King his court was keeping; A river in its childhood, then A mountain burn, ran gaily leaping. The sward within the silvan bower Was sprinkled with leaf-filter'd light, And gemm'd with many a starry flower, The primrose pale and gowan bright. Pleased butterflies, the mute and fair, Twinkled their silv'ry wings so gay, And pittering grasshoppers were there, And bees their soft bassoons did play. The elfin lords and ladies all From harebells sipt the sparkling dew, When in the midst, startling the ball, The frighten'd Puck amazement threw. âUp, up,â he cried, âup and begone, These verdant haunts you now must leave; Remorseless ploughshares hasten on, Old greens and clover lawns to cleave. âThe saucy sower marches proud, And showers the future har'st around; Behind the harrows hurtle rude, And grubs and sprawling worms abound. âNo more our revels we may keep On plushy field or moonlight hill; The snail with eye-tipt horn may weep, But bumming beetles must be still. âOh! never more the marsh-born gnat Must sing to warn fair maids to flee, And soon the eager twilight bat Must hush his fluttering shriek of glee. âFor pawky art, with wizard sleight, O'er nature has her cantrips thrown; The moorland wild and shaggy height, Captive to man, the lasso The Spanish noose for catching wild cattle. own.â On moth and fly, and ladybird, Away the flichtering fairies fly, And blithe cuckoos are shouting heard, As speed the pony insects by. O'er peat-moss brown and lonely waste, The fugitives erratic ride, And o'er the yellow sands they haste, As if they chased the ebbing tide. But lo! the aimless waves returnâ The fairies see them coming driveâ Behind is heard the plough and churn, And headlong in the sea they dive. A REVERIE. Sometimes the winged fancy flies Beyond the scope of furthest stars, Where fading light in darkness dies, And uncreated chaos wars. Amidst the turbulence sublime, Sound has no placeâthe elements Roll silent as the mists of time, Or the dread bosom's dark intents. There storms career with spectral might Along creation's lonely shore; Life, in 'fore death, sleeps as the light Lay in the cold black gloom of yore. Dim dreams relate a mystic tale, That, far unknown beyond the past, Where poets' thoughts in fancy fail, There is a void abysm vast. Twins of eternity, their sire Omnipotence, there Night and Death, Ere heaven could bless, or hell aspire, Or chaos worlds to time bequeath, Held bifold rule; one subject old, Dumb Silence, only own'd their sway, And in their realm a seraph bold On quests forbidden lost his way. Still on and on, with feet and wings, As speeds the ostrich in the wild,â Behind the searcher distance flings, By hope and fear alike beguiled. But never shall he reach a bourne, Till Providence forgets to tend, Or hurrying round in deem'd return, He find the endless circle end. A SONG. FOR A TEMPERANCE SOCIETY. I know the good fellow, A rogue though he be; His game is the shuttlecock, Feather'd with glee. With jibes and with jokes, With banter and story, And merry new songs, The knave's in his glory. But trust not the rascal,â The hypocrite shun; He means but to sadden, When blithest with fun. And ask in the morning, (The dog let us throttle,) How goes it, old Headach? His name it is Bottle. THE TOWER OF DESTINY. Ah me! in life what fond enchantments lure! The laughing child on sunny threshold playing, How little deems it that within the door A stalwart demon stoops, for ever braying In Fate's dread mortar, ghastly and obscure, The drugs of that fell draught which mortals must endure! Thus as I slumber'd on the starry sward, (Starr'd by the silvery daisies beaming bright,) A gentle fay entranced Fancy heard Her tale of olden minstrelsy recite: In form a bee, but vocal as a bird On blossom or on bough, the mystic sprite appear'd. Her song began, as fairies love to sing, With deft moralities of quaint conceit, As rural maids in vernal garlands hing The fluttering butterflies tied by the feet, Or sprinkle jewels from the glancing spring, And o'er the flowery wreath fantastic beauty fling. The lay and legend, which she sweetly sung, Was of a castle turreted and hoar, That from a capeland far its shadow flung, Sadd'ning the waves that fondled on the shore,â What time at eve the curfew bell was rung, And down the banner'd mast the listless blazon hung. âA pile,â she sang, âupon the mountain's brow, Shines like a diadem, and many an age Hath seen the pinnacles' refulgent glow, And round the ramparts baffled ruin rage; For spells of power forbid its overthrow, A griffin guards the gate, and warriors bend the bow. âIt is yclept the Tower of Destiny, And sad within the dungeon-keep there dwells A hapless wight enthrall'd by Mystery, A dark enchanter, as tradition tells, Who in that castle, brewing sorcery, Beguiles the guests that drink the drugged fallacy. âThe captive thrall that maketh there his moan, Is known, I ween, within the world of time As Human Life, a frail and fetter'd one, With Error lodged, and manacled to Crime; Yet not in darkness does he ever groan,â Delusions glaik his walls, and shining shapes are shown. âSometimes he pines a creature most forlorn, Toss'd by disease, his thoughts dishevell'd quite, Restless he wearies for the dawn of morn To thin the darkness of the pitchy night; And oft his bosom's lord with care is torn, When from the upland green he hears the hunter's horn. âBut oft ecstatic with the sparkling draught That Hope presents in her bewitching glass, He hunts the Iris of fantastic thought, And flying forward, sees not as they pass, That fixed things are but by Fancy brought,â Still motionless they stand, yet seem with motion fraught. âAnd when at last the fumes have pass'd away, And the delirium of the cup is gone, Wearied and wan he eyes the parting ray, And on the earth dejected lays him down, Or gazing round, beholds the twilight gray But lights the self-same cell where he began the day. â'Tis ever thus, in anguish or in toil, The phantom man his earthly transit drees; Deceived at times by changeful Fortune's smile, The unsubstantial glaiks of life he sees, But the bright visions soon his grasp beguile, And with a secret sigh he doffs the mortal coil.â TO FATE. Be my asylum in some nameless wild, Amidst the dread, the vast, the unconfined; Where Nature sits enthroned on mountains piled, And awes with wordless eloquence the mind: There let me oft, to thee or God resign'd, Thrill with the mystery of her mighty spell,â Behold the lightning's flash consume the wind, And hear the welkin's universal bell, Tolling the thunder peal, that deep and dreadful knell. Oh! pious solitude, that loves to muse On spacious upland, or in silvan glen, Be thou with me, when my rapt spirit views The griefs, the cares, the strifes, the toils of men. May Echo, far unseen by mortal ken, That solemn clerk, repeat my boding sigh; And hymning falls, and forest anthems, thenâ The psalms of natureâteach me how to die, For, ah! they can but hope that moil beneath the sky. THE FERRY HOUSE A SCOTTISH TALE OF HALLOWEEN. INSCRIBED TO DR MOIR OF MUSSELBURGH. The day was come, the trysted day, That drew me from the moors away, In wynd, or close, or stair, to speer If wins blithe luckie Fortune here. With heavy step one afternoon, Bearing my gun, my song a croone, I thought with scad of day to reach The Ferry publick on the beach; And long ere night had closed her brods, To cross the loch, and sleep where cods And weel made beds, with sheets, I wot, Show inns may be where clans are not. But all the road I had to travel, Was just a clay eclipse of gravel, And every step I forward ettled, A backward slidder whelp'd or kittled. The day was sober, gray, and still, With plaid o' mist was wrapp'd the hill. The burn ran brown; the heather bell Shed tears, for whatâit couldna tell. The crows held synod, and discoursed Of dules ordained, and dooms the worst; An owl flew pastâher zealous passage Show'd she was earnest on a message. Star of the glen, the primrose pale Gleams meekly in the shaggy vale; The witch-forbidding row'ns display Their cluster'd sparks of heatless ray; The sloes with sullen ripeness glow, As maids unsought, stale virgins grow; And nutsâthe crop is poor, I weenâ Ha! I forget 'tis Halloween. But I must hasten while 'tis lightâ The Deil, they say, has rope this night. A something in forgotten time, Still makes this haunted night sublime; A shadowy shape, a mystery past, Vast, black, and strange, behind is cast! Dreigh was the way, but by and by I saw a star, no in the sky, But in the publick's window near, The eye of shelter beaming clear; The wick so short, the candle tall, Denoted James was within call; But from its houff the cobble flown, Show'd he was o'er the Ferry gone. There was no helpâI could but bide For his return, let what betide; So at the door I tirl'd the pinâ It opened, and I slippet in; For I had heard his marrow lay At death's door sick, but she was clay. Stretch'd on the bed, in deadals drest, A plate of salt lay on her breast; Quaite was the house, for death was in itâ There lay the corpseâalas! auld Janet! No doubt the sight was very fleein, But well I knew she had been deein, And heard it said, a day or two Were all that she might warsle thro'. It gied, tho', to my heart a stang, To see her yird I knew sae lang; So down afore the corpse I sat, And lainly eerie all but grat. I thought of lifeâa shuttle flyingâ Of bairns and bearsâall flesh that's dying, And life, that's like the blooming rose,â In morning sunshine blithe it blows. The flower is pluck'dâits soul, the smell, Where is it now? in heaven or hell? Oh, mortal man! within the glass Thy ebbing sand is growing less, And at thy elbow, dart in hand, Ready to strike, grim Death doth stand, With orbless holes where eyes have been; A skull he wearsâit's Halloween! I felt I was almost asleep, My limbs were tired, the way was deep, But to behold again that sight, Put soon irreverent sleep to flight, While sad to my remembrance came The lambent glory of a name. Ah! what avails it now, I said, To her that lies in yon still bed, What gauds of pride, or gems of grace, Adorn the living female race? What shouts of jeopardy or joy, The carlin's slumber can destroy? What flattery soothe the calm cold heart, When dust from dust no more shall part, And all to life and fancy dear, Lie hush'dâhush'dâhush'd upon the bier? There sleep the tuneful and the brave; The master there, and there the slave, Afar from boiling-house or penâ Gods! I forgetâI dream again! Vex'd with myself, I leave my chairâ Go to the door, breathe caller air, But soon resume my doleful seat, And morals strange I soon repeat; For there, before me, lay the dead, A thing to shake the soul with dread, Nor is it wise, full well I ween, To wake a corpse on Halloween. Then, in an awed and solemn strain, I ruminated thus againâ What was this world before e'er life, Death's parent, felt th' unfilial knifeâ What was ere space was fill'd with rings, Orbits of stars, and starry things? While yet I spoke, I saw the door Flung gently wide, and sad and sour, Of mean attire, two labourous men Come softly with a coffin ben. They lay it down forenent the bed, And from a shelf across the head, Take, all in silence, from its place, A gardevine, and syne a glass; They spoke not, but one held it out, The other fill'd itâfull, no doubt. Being refresh'd they rise, and lay The shapen lump of kirkyard clay Within the coffin's dismal womb, Dread prologue to the grave and tomb. When all was done, with stealthy feet, I saw them from the house retreat. But long the silent room of death Was not sereneâI saw a wraithâ Auld Janet'sâas I live I saw her Come out from hiding in a drawer, And lift the coffin lid and raise The dead as drest in its last claes. While mute I gaz'd, she tore the shroud, Death's vestment, off, and cried aloudâ âMy true gudeman, awake, prepare, With you this night I'll mak my lair; Joe of my youth, shake off this trance, With us the jointless dead shall dance; A minstrel spring, at tryst or fair, Is gay to hear, but we'll compare The dead man's reel, the grave's strathspey, That the blind worms and maggots play, With rubs of thairm, that mortal men Make when long parted meet again.â Then up full brisk the mort arose, Awak'ning from its dumb repose, But, oh! he was a sight to see, As one that died in poverty; For he was gaunt, the flesh was gone, Without was skin, within was bone; His een did shine like blobs of dew; But, oh! his mouth! it gart me grue! His neck was long, his legs and arms Were things but seen at witching charms; He was as Hunger's eager gnaw Had toom'd his inside, kite and a'! He seem'd well pleas'd, his een did show it, Heavens hide thae teeth! for I'm no poet; To look on sights forbid life's forfeit, Sights! necromancies of a surfeit. But ere I wist, like lightning shed, A change came o'er the living dead; He seem'd of glassâof shapen air, An outline thing, a lightless glare, And all the house appear'd to be Fill'd with a countless companie, Since the first dawn of ages born, Those that had been their pride and scornâ The dead were there, for wondrous then, A mystery met my sharpen'd ken. Between all edges, forms, and things, This thought is derived from those kind of mystical engravings in which the French excel, where the picture presents at the first glance one subject, and upon examination shows in the outlines another. That corporal sense to vision brings, I saw departed spirits shine, Souls that had liv'd, a dim outline, Theirs who had earn'd the world's applause, And theirs who perish'd by the lawsâ All, all appear'd, as if I sat For trial in Jehosaphat. Again the door was open thrown, And one by one, to me all known, Successive enter'd, old and young; The shadowy bridegroom then had tongue, And welcom'd them with courtesy, Beckon'd them in, syne said to me, âRise, stranger, rise, sir, ye maun come,â But, oh! this night to take ye home!â 'Twas James that spokeâa moment's gleam Show'd I had dreamt a prophet's dream; For those I saw, the guests were they, Since ta'en by Death: this gars me say, While heaven is blue and earth is green, Wake not a corpse on Halloween. MAY. In riant hours, the buxom May Bids laughing streams deride the sun, And birds be blithe and lilies gay, And shouting children leap and run. Like topaz bright on lady's breast, The nuzzling bee sucks on the flower; And garlanded all in their best, The trees have donn'd like maids their dower. The cuckoo from the leafy bough Alarms the churl who walks alone; The whistling swains the fallows plough, And maidens sigh and poets moan. There's not a bloom on bush or brier But lures the old to pluck and smell; The songsters of the woodland choir But pleasures to the young foretell. The bleating lambs to mothers dear Awaken kindness in the heart; And wingless milkmaids, singing clear, With larks and linnets bear a part. The delver sees o'er cherish'd seed Green omens of the summer's smile, And, half reluctant, nips the weed That peeps unbidden from the soil. The duck floats proudly in the pool, Her callow young are sailing nigh; The far-come galley, rich and full, Not prouder round sees wherries ply. The cottage smoke, a shadowy tree, Stands in the calm and sunny air, And hopping mills, whose plashing glee The wading schoolboys seem to share. The cat purs on the roof serene, And slyly oft the sparrow eyes; Stretch'd in the sunshine, on the green, The panting dog in slumber lies. The blackbird in his wicker keep Rehearses olden minstrelsy; And mystic swallows circling sweep, Skill'd in the craft of masonry. Their webs in winter woven, lo! The ruddy damsels singing spread, And seeds of purity they sow, In shining showers of silver shed. With nimble brush and carol shrill The painter at the window stands, And nesters for the furzy hill Enlist for Saturday their bands. With willow pipes delighted sit, In shadow cool of kiln or barn, Melodious urchins, concert-smit, And chirps of heavenly rapture learn. Not happier he on stone in stream, Who tranc'd the travelling traitor eyes, And glorying in the clouded beam, Plucks twinkling stars from nether skies. As bless'd, more bless'd, the prattling child, Who crowns the labouring waggon's load; Sublime on shudd'ring chattels piled, And moving to a new abode. He shares not with his sire below The carking of the bosom's ache, Nor deems the home he soon shall know, A refuge poverty must take. O, spring of life! May of the mind! Thy gorgeous wreaths are doom'd to fadeâ But why to sadness so inclined, Should I thus seek the solemn shade? Why thus the vernal nymph abjure That laves the world with light and song? Ah! bright sweet May, thou hast no cure,â My anguish Life can but prolong. May 16, 1824. THE UNIVERSE. âAh, me! how gross,â I heard a Geni say, âAre the perceptions of the creature man! He lives in twilight, and believes it day, And from Beersheba even unto Dan Chatters of orbits and the milky way, As if infinitude were but a span, And he, the wight, could mete Nature's stupendous plan! âStars he calls suns, and dreams of orbs sublime, When thus the freckles of the night he names; Tells us of cycles, eddy swirls of time, In the great shoreless ocean's stream, and claims Stern durability for hills. That chime The moon rings monthly on the signs, he frames Into a melody, and storms by it he tames. âWhat is in all this solemn mystery, That they who know th' eternal vast of space With awe should note? Clipt by the boundary Of that which has none, there must be a place Within the measureless periphery, Where shining spheres run their appointed race As broad in their bright disks as vision can embrace. âYet these great orbs, bowl'd by th' Almighty hand, Which roll unknown to mortals of the earth, Do less amazement by their might command Than the small myriads of viewless birth, Whose globe and world's a pile of drifting sand, A fruitful atom in the Arabian dearth. Children of God are they, and may be bless'd for worth. âTo think the scope and purposes of things (It is a darkling vapour of the mind) Can e'er be scann'd by manâyes, thoughts have wings With which they fly to regions unconfin'd; But still they feel entanglement, and strings That to a round their finite freedom bind, Careering in the light, or riding on the wind.â The Geni ceased; but to my throbbing ear His words of truth a humbling import boreâ How small is man, how circumscrib'd his sphere; His life an instant was, and is no more! With conscious shame opprest, I wept that e'er I deem'd the earth was aught but dross or ore, Or such a thing as man could be, but to deplore. A SONG. [The tear on Mary's cheeks, the sigh] The tear on Mary's cheeks, the sigh That heaves her gentle breast, Betoken Love within her heart Has fondly built a nest. But, ah! that sigh, which, without words, To hope of rapture speaks,â The dewdrops on that blushing rose, That pity on her cheeks, Are not for meâ Are not for me! Another claims the golden prizeâ I can but fortune blame; If she be happier with that youth, My bliss should be the same. Life had no charm but when I dreamt Her happiness was mine; But if another dearer prove, To sorrow and repine Is not for meâ Is not for me! The all of life was that sweet maid; An insect in the light, I liv'd for herâthe beam withdrawn, I droop forlorn in night: Why am I not content? oh! why Still of my stars complain? If she be happier with that youth, Why should I feel this pain? It cannot beâ It cannot be! A SCOTTISH WELCOME. And is it you, and are ye come? Sit down, sit down in bye; Get up and pierce the bowie, Kate, This night we'll drink it dry. Bid in the neebors, young and auld, As fast as ye can ringe, And mak a tanal on the loan, O' a' the biggest binge. Gie me your han', my winsome freer, Hech, sirs, I sadly trowâ Foy, ripe the ribs frae lug to lug, And pack the chumla fu'. Where has the glaikit Laithron flown? Fling on her rock an' wheel; To hae this night sae bleert a spunk, Gude spin her to the deil! Come, tell's the ferlies ye have seen; Och, but you're croint an' wan,â But here comes Meg, the miller's wife, And that's auld aunty Anne. Jock Aikin too, as douce as aye, He's now a muslin weaver; Poor lad! his bread has sairly fail't, And there's Rab Dock the shaver. Come, Saunders Clerk, what gars ye scog?

The weest wean the Clachan owns, Shall keep the night in fame, When he that was so far awa', Return'd to bide at hame. August, 1804. THE HERMIT PETER. PREFACE. The little volume of Poems which the Author published after his Autobiography, contained three books of the poetical tale of the Hermit Peter. They were all that had been then written, save a few scraps which are interwoven in their proper place. He had no intention, at the time, of proceeding farther with the work. The opinion, however, of several friends, in whose taste he has confidence, and the favour with which they were noticed by some of the critics, induced him to resume the composition, after it had been twenty years suspended. The two following Books complete the undertaking. It cannot add any merit to the poem to mention that they were dictated in a state if not of blindness, at least when the eyes of the Author were very ineffectual, and that they were chiefly composed in bed,âcircumstances which should mitigate the severity of criticism. They were the pastime of infirmity, when the limbs were felt to be too heavy for the will, and when weakness compelled him to acknowledge the presence of disease, sharpening mental suffering. Edinburgh, 12th July, 1834. BOOK IV. But the high mood of martyrdom and faith Was not in all: amidst that multitude There was a man, stern and mysterious, Whom many woes had spited with his kind, And he did hate the universal race With the revengeful ardour of a foe. None knew his country, but the name he bore Was Argentless, Peter the Penniless. and his dark sullen mien Show'd faded habitudes of state and power, Beneath the mask of sordid beggary; Yet he was rich beyond the utmost greed Of grasping avarice; and it was told How he that coveted rare art possess'd Which turns the baser metals into gold. Few were the treasures by himself dispensed, Yet were his gifts malignâwith curse they came, And it was noted that his hand, unblest, Gave not in charity to needful worth, To pale distress, that shrinks to speak of woe, Nor young endeavour that but wants a friendâ He gave to spendthrifts, and the fated rash Whom Nature, with maternal arms, restrains. Calm was his visageâno man witness'd there The flush of passion, nor from his still eye The glance of any mood, save the fix'd beam Of a fell spirit, that in its dread course Moved onward, reckless of all overthrow. Solemn and low, still in his measured speech The ear heard more than the soft tongue express'd; And doubt and awe, when he was kindest, woke Strange fear, as if some guardian angel then Whisper'd, âBeware!â When Argentless beheld The crowd transmuted from ignoble rage To holiest zeal, with eager steps he through The clustering throng on to the portal press'd; And as the Hermit from his mother turn'd, Blessing and blest, knelt at his feet the first Who claim'd the badge and symbols of the war. The Hermit started, and awhile survey'd With scorn the mystic stranger; then exclaim'd, âWhat daring demon prompts thee in this hour To try thy frauds on me? Hence, and repent!â Abash'd, detected, from his searching glance The sullen Argentless shrunk cowering, and, As a sea-mark, the crowd shunn'd him, afraid; But soon his visage reassumed its calm, And motionless, unheeding all, he stood With downcast looks, till from the portal led Th' attended Hermit meekly had retired, And to their homes the multitude dispersed. Then, unobserved, came ruthless Argentless, His vengeful spirit that lay coil'd unknown, Unfolding rear'd itself, and writh'd with rage, Malignant, fierce. Save in his lurid eyes That sparkled cruelty, no outward sign Of the roused hell in his remorseless breast Betray'd his purpose, ever to himself, Like burning torment dropp'd into a wound. He knelt, and swore, with clenched hands upraised, Never to quit the Hermit's fated service, Till he had brought the victims of his zeal Into some jeopardy, as deep and dire As that red gulf wherein the Egyptian king Perish'd of old with all his chivalry. The skies grew grim at his perturbed vow, Rash lightning leapt, and pond'rous thunder roll'd, As if his anger hurl'd the rattling peal, While hail and fire in frantic omen fell. Undaunted Argentless smiled at the storm, Pleased with its advocacy, and for shelter Craved wild admittance, where apart, sublime, The Hermit sat, who with stern kindling eyes Beheld him enter, and rebuk'd his boldness. The enfeoffted demon in the bad man's breast, Saw, in the mind-beam of the Hermit's look, A searching ray of that all-sighted light Amidst the brightness of high heaven insphered, And grasping, clung to the doom'd heart possess'd. To ban him from his cause the saint arose, And all around hush'd and expectant stood, As when the breathless multitude prepares To see the axe upon the guilty fall. The conscious misanthrope again shrunk backâ At his retreat a rustling noise arose, Dreader than riots of the woods or waves, Or than the silence of the untrodden waste. âKnow ye that man?â the solemn Godscall A monk in the first crusade. cried. With falt'ring accents, and mysterious sadness, The Hermit answer'dââYes, I first beheld him When in my pilgrimage I paced forlorn The shipless shores and lone funereal wastes, Where mould'ring lies the skeleton of Greece. It chanced one evening, from the hov'ring skies, I sought the lee-side of an ancient temple, Whose old magnificence was crush'd and scatter'd. The storm had blown the beacon from the mole, And wrecks and seamen's corses strew'd the shore; Along the sounding strand, with helpless wail, Wringing their hands, their hair dishevell'd flying, The wretched women echoed to the cries Of drowning men beyond the reach of aid. The bells rung wildly, and the monks with torches Mingling their requiems with the booming winds, Brought down their sacred relics to the sea, That would not be appeas'd, but louder rag'd, As if in bedlam mockery of their faith,â So wildly did the demons of the air Rule in that dismal night. For refuge I Crept to the vaults beneath the gorgeous ruin; There I beheld him leaning o'er a fire Which he had kindled with the wave-bleach'd splinters Of founder'd barks, and bones,âthey seem'd of men. The flames that flar'd in his tempestuous eyes Show'd he was wrapt in fierce imaginings. His garb and mien proclaim'd he was a soldier, But the proud plume upon his helm was faded. I would have marr'd his musing, but he broke Into such frenzied blasphemy of man, That I fled shuddering to the storm for shelter.â The preacher paus'd; and from the dismal tale An audible response of hearts was heard, Like those dread echoes in the Alpine hills, Which the bold traveller in his daring hears Throb in their crystal caves, and holds his breath. Meanwhile the storm had in its rage abated, And frequent from her window in the cloud Look'd out the moon, and often smiling, told The shelt'ring pilgrim and the ling'ring guest They might go forth. What time the solemn bell Warn'd the enthusiast list'ners to their homes, All were departed of that pious throngâ Save the fond mother and her zealous son, None else remain'd: awhile they silent sat, She gazing on him, tracing one by one Each infant grace that beam'd still on her heart, Till she forgot the faded lapse of time, And caught him fondly, crying, âOh! my child!â He chid her care, yet gently took her hand, As she oft doubted of his great design, And urg'd him long with many a look of love To stray no more, but shelter in her care. Soon the scene chang'dâa loud fanatic shout Rose in the streetsâthick hurrying feet were heard With tread and trampling; and the Hermit rose, With eager hand furling the lattice screen, To ask what tumult in that hour so still Awoke the peaceful night: amaz'd, he saw A gorgeous banner with the cross emblazon'd, High streaming to the moon, and Argentless, In knightly panoply, with truncheon'd grasp, Like a skill'd captain marshalling the throng. Indignant at the sight, the Hermit rush'd Straight to the crowd, and with uplifted hand Sternly forbade the iron-nerv'd old man To touch the ark of heaven's own hallow'd cause. But the rous'd spirit of the misanthrope, Thron'd in the chariot of its dire career, Triumphant driving to the prize of doom, Would not then be commanded, cried aloud, âBehold your leader!ââTo the holy man Th' emblazon'd banner stoop'd in homage, and The awe-struck throng with solemn ardour bow'd, While from their lurkings all the fiends of ill That watch'd the contest, sprung exulting forth. Th' ambitious demon, that with regal sceptre Marshals the warrior to unblest renown, Pour'd out the vial of disastrous pride On the prone Hermit, as with shouts of joy The fated armies took their destin'd way; While overhead, countless malignant stars, The fiends on wing, grew pallid with alarm, Smote with strange horror, lest in that dread hour Heaven's Wrath was there with victory prepar'd. Still, as from upland lakes and woody glens, And sedgy wilds, and marshy regions drear, The pomp of some majestic river comes, The worshipp'd Ganges, or the mightier tide Of savage waters, rolling measureless Through wide Columbian wastes, all places pour'd Their fervent myriads to augment the host Led by the Hermit to the Holy Land. No trumpet's clangour cheer'd their toilsome march, Nor spirit-stirring fife, nor the bold peal Of the courageous drum, was ever heard; But, more inspiring than the mingled voice Of all accorded instruments of sound, They mov'd exultingly with psalms and songs Of ancient Israel to battle led, And led victorious by the Lord of Hosts Through seas, o'er deserts drear, and impious kings, And thus triumphantly their anthems rung: âThe mighty God of war, he is our captain; He leads, he guides us in our pathless way, Arm'd with the thunder, and hors'd on the storm. None can subdue, nor is there any victor But He that fought for the chosen of old. He is with usâyes, and we shall prevailâ Onward Jehovah, triumphant avengerâ Onward Jehovah, to conquer we go!â The dismal Energies that rose from hell Saw them advance, and for awhile aghast Stood doubtful of the sight, wond'ring and aw'd, What mystic purpose Providence divine Would then unfold, that Argentless awhile Should be the leader in the Hermit's cause. But o'er the waves and troubles of mankind, They call'd to mind how, in the dark'ning storm, As beacon-towers on rocks and shoals are seen, The bad and bold guide the rich argosies, And rush'd exulting, fluttering all their wings, To where, assembling on the Syrian plains, As from the arid waste the fiery blast Comes breathing desolation, Mahomed's Unrighteous hosts, with pride incensed, were ranged; For rumour then, with speeding feet and wing, From all her tongues cried âChristendom is roused!â Fierce flamed their arrogance, as erst of yore Stern Heaven ordain'd the Babylonian king To stand on Zion with triumphant sword, And from her gates the conquer'd Israel drive, To mourn in thraldom's chains by Babel's stream. The fiends beheld the infidels afar, Moving their panoply, as when the winds Of autumn mock the billowy forest scene, With waves embroider'd, in Canadian woods, Ere winter tears the garland from the bough; And viewless then all as the deadly cold, Life-searching, penetrates the arborous aisle, They enter fell each bosom's dark abyss, And urge to desolate intents of war. All night they raged, and when the orient day Unfurl'd his glorious banner, and the stars Fled at his bright advancing, they began To roll there countless; as the unbanded flames Devour the distance, and consume the heath, Or onwards still some bankless Hellespont Holds its wide course unchanging in the sea. The mail-clad chiefs moved like portentous orbs, And marshall'd squadrons in their proud array, [The glittering spear-points kindled by the sun,] Rode underneath a canopy of stars, While gleaming meteors, glancing wild and high, Threw flickering fires where'er the cymbals rung. At eve they halted, and to Mecca's shrine Far in the south, with cleansed hands they kneel, And lowly supplicate their prophet's care. The blissful host who saw their orisons, Brighten'd to splendour, for they knew of old, That aspirations of the humble heart Were ever welcome in the courts of heaven. Cow'ring remote, the sinful from below Beheld the dawn, and wondering backward scowl'd, That such bright joy should as in radiance shine From the glad seraphim, who, ruby-red, Glow'd constant guardians of the heavenly towers; But all was calm, and to their sordid ken No sign disclosed why, borne on ardent wings, The prayers of men are so received on high. The worship finish'd, and the homage done O'er all the plain, as in the twilight hour The stars break sparkling out along the sky, The kindled camp-fires spread their gems of light, Till earth seem'd emulous with constellations. Then the lone warrior, as he walks his rounds, Feels the soft thought breath'd from the stilly air, And unperceived permits the tear to flow For his far home, and wonders what is Fame. Yea, haply e'en the young enthusiast then, As on the embattled sward entranced he sits, Sway'd by the starry eloquence of night, May, as he hears some father's passing sigh For orphans left that shall be seen no more, Own the delirium of heroic dreams. But lo! the mornâthe living lightâthe morn, The life that's visibleâthe morn that brings Refulgent hope and willing enterprise, With crested thoughts in plume and panoply, Peeps o'er the shoulder of yon eastern hill. Then with the shadows of the fleeing night, That harbinger the bright approach of day, The boding fancy, and the hidden fear, The care, the sorrow, and the doubt depart. Up rose the sun, and every turban'd chief Sat on his pawing and impatient steed, As the proud war-ship dares the coming wave, Before the signal for her voyage flies; But soon afar the trumpets, sounding clear, Bade them advance, while on their backs the sun, Unclouded, pour'd his fervency intense. As on they move, the sound murm'ring around, Rose as the insect swarms, that dismal come, Mantling the plague, careering on the wind; Such as o'ershadowed Egypt's fated land, When showering numberless on bladed fields They fell, and mourning swains saw the bare soil Blacken with famine where they did delight. Before them rose a rugged rising ground; But as obedient Jordan curl'd his tide Back to its fountain, stream o'erflowing stream, When stood God's ark within the river's bed, They seem'd to mount the steep acclivity, And on the ridge extend their dazzling files, As the furr'd Russ on Borean clouds beholds The shifting phalanx of the midnight light. At last they halted, and high hov'ring near, The licensed demons hung on darkening wing; For glorious issuing, all prepared for war, The seraphim appear'd: as the bright sun Emerging radiant from obscure eclipse, They sparkling shone,âso on the hills around, Of old, the prophet show'd his trembling servant Squadrons of fire and flaming chariots stand. But the dread war was not permitted then; The fiends, dim mounting, sought the azure depths Of far abysms in the welkin hid, Shunning the sworded seraphim, afraid; While from the height, where stood the infidels, Remote was seen across the distant plain, The coming multitude with banner'd pomp, And choral anthems of exulting praise, Led by the Hermit to the Holy Land. END OF BOOK IV. BOOK V. As when the hunter, who has scoop'd his cave Beneath the lonely snows of Labrador, Looks forth in spring, and from the rugged coast Sees, on the shipless ocean, wide and wild, The broken winter's crashing fragments driven, Steer'd by the wind, Nature's dread bedlamite, To headlong ruin in the southern clime, The awe-struck shepherds, on the hills afar, Beheld the Hermit's desultory throng. Ranged on the uplands, stood the Saracens, And as, high towering on some glittering shore, A regal city lifts her gorgeous head, They saw them coming, and in pride of power Waited for battle, steadfast and refulgent. Nor did the arbiters that heaven had arm'd With glorious adamant, angelic mail, On cliff and cloud, and mountain hoar, to awe The fiends that war but to extend dismay, Stand unprepared: they, with enkindling files, Marshall'd their squadrons round the infidels, As if mysterious Providence had will'd Might and predominance to their ill cause. Meanwhile, alarm'd, in terrible divan, Grim in their dismal halls, the demons held Sullen communionâfor their sultan stern Had told them, in the prophecies of Heaven, Ere the foundations of the world were laid, It was predicted that a time was set When evil would begin to wane, and good Spread bright and brighter into perfect day. Around, on thrones of fire, red fire, they sat, Mantled with darkness black;âsome, thoughtful, bent Their knotty foreheads down upon their palms, And others grinn'd, impassion'd to be marr'd In their malignancy, while backward cower'd A hideous thrall and servitor of Hell: Eager he look'd, as if the dawn of hope Could ever glow within a breast accurst, Made heedful by the legend; till at last Their chief arose. Like some great edifice At dead of night seen wrapt in smoke and flame, He tower'd before them, and in thunder spoke. âWhen we were first from heaven's star-spangled walls Hurl'd headlong down to yon abhorr'd abyss, And weltering lay, toss'd on the sulph'rous waves, Whose fiery spray wastes the encumben'd vault Whereon the world of time has since been raised, I strove to wake, with earnest lofty voice, Your stunn'd and fall'n spirits to defy The worst of fate with courage resolute; And to this epoch, with undaunted front, Still unsubdued, you have achieved my praise. But now, all else that you unflinching bore, His wrath and thunderbolts, were as the rain, The vernal rain, that patient hinds implore, Compared to that unmitigable fire Shower'd on the pamper'd cities of the plain,â To that great contest which must now ensue. Therefore, dire tests and champions of Hell, Stand firm! serene in your collected might, And not unfought for yield the glorious prize; Well it becomes the legions of the lost To wrench fresh valour from declared despair.â He ceas'd, but none responded: all sat mute As if in doubt, when suddenly, as burst In storms and hurricanes of volleying flame, Glaring strange day upon the trembling earth, The nitre hordes of a beleaguer'd town Fired in their dungeon vaults, the fiends blazed up With zeal intense, and terrible combustion. Wildly they glared, and from their aspects shed A sullen radiance of fierce iron light, As when aghast Sicilian shepherds see The rolling lava's burning mountain tide Inflame the sky, or when the shipman drear, Wint'ring forgotten in the Arctic gloom, Beholds red phantasms in the crimson sky, And omens fatal to the sons of men. While they perplex'd; upon the Syrian plain The rash crusaders meet the Saracens, And furious meditate remorseless strife. Glittering afar as the thick flickering wings Of countless locusts murmuring in the air, Ere yet their riots on the fields begin, The adverse armies join: all the sure earth, As the fierce onset of their charge outspreads, Shakes with the dissonance of voice and gleam, As if the noise were visible, and Wrath, With Vengeance carr'd, scourg'd on her thund'ring steeds, Crushing resistance; dire the maddening throng Raged hoarsely, and the sound came on the wind To the lone swain who on the hills remote Hears the rough billows on the sandy shore; And he beheld, like sparkling showers of fire, The mingling weapons of the warriors glance, As on that night, when the consenting gods, All on their thrones, as poets feign, survey'd The doom of Ilium, and th' insensate flames Lick from the earth her palaces and towers. Till set of sun they fought; and all the plain Was with the dying and the wounded strewn, As the reap'd field is with the sheaves in harvest; And when the shadows of the twilight spread, The thirsty vengeance of the infidels Was still unslaked; nor when the solemn moon, From her calm threshold on the eastern hill, Blushing survey'd the madness of mankind, Did the crusaders in their zeal relent. Amaz'd, the Hermit saw the carnage piled, And on the hallow'd soldiers of the cross, Certain as death, still with unsparing might The edged sternness of their foes descend, And all around, in unavailing gore, The victims of his flatter'd rashness lie. At last afar the loud triumphant peal Of insolent trumpets to the mountains told The battle won, and by the Saracens. âHave I so sinn'd,â with clasped hands he cried, âThat He, the irresponsible, who guides Th' avenging armies of the living God, The Lord Jehovah, hath deserted me?â And with the cry of one cast to despair, Flung himself headlong, and with frantic grasps In frenzy wrestled with the passive earth. Long prone he lay, while over all the field The scatter'd remnants, leaderless, deplor'd The issues of the fight, but Argentless: He dying lay, yet, ere his spirit fled, A dreadful effort made to view the waste, Rais'd on his bleeding arm, and when he heard The note of triumph swelling high and clear, He knew the sound rose from the infidels, And shouting shrill, in mirthless laughter, died. Then there was peace; that stillness ever found Where War has battled till he can no more, And Valour, weary with his unwip'd sword, Sits pale and thoughtful on the harmless slain. No longer then sounds the rude clash of arms, Nor squadrons' thunder, nor the victor's shout Mingles with curses hoarse of baffled rage. Far other notes fill the wide ear of nightâ The choral anthem, and the hymn of war. Cries of loud suff'ring were unceasing heard In dismal concord; and heart-rending there The cadence of the dying soldier's groan; Like the deep death-bell in some mourning town, Where pestilence has enter'd, deeply booms The long-drawn anguish of the wounded charger; And there the fiends that prowl with unblest lights Are wandering seen, and wheresoe'er they stop, Shrieks wildly sharp break from the mangled wretch, Struck, as he welters, by the plunderer's knife. At morn, the soldier from his comrade dead There bans the camp-dog; and the shatter'd there, To scare the foul birds hovering o'er them, lift Their bleeding limbs, and roll their gashy heads; And there the sun, remorseless on his throne, Brings clouds of carnage flies that fill the air With quickening gloom, a living shower of sound. Rous'd from his trance, for wrapt in trance he lay, With sorrow stunn'd, the awaking Hermit gaz'd, And on the upland saw the sated foes Their bright battalions range; while all the plain, Where he had yesterday exulting seen Phantoms of fame and effigies of power, By him the blossoms deem'd of kingly fruit, Lay still and drear, with ruins overspread, As where Balbek and mute Palmyra mourn Their doom and widowhood amidst the waste. âLord,â then he cried, âthy will be done on earth! The worm no more shall in thy chariot ride, Or be aught else than thy implicit agent. I may not question, Lord, that still with thee The victory rests, tho' for a while exult The powers of Hell as conquerors of might. Thine is the vantage of the bloody day, And he who contrite bends the humbled head, Crown'd, for a diadem, but with disasters, May yet the vintage of thy wisdom gather. I will not, Victor, Warrior, Avenger, Though now before me, as the wrecks and corses Seen on the shore when Miriam sung thy praise, Lie all the spring of Christendom destroy'd, Let my heart sinkâI do rejoice, Jehovah; It is thy work, and, therefore, must be wise. But, oh! dread Merciful, my weakness pityâ I am a man, and full of frailties, Lord; I can but weep that in thy righteous counsels Such was the judgment for my errors given, That yon bright sun beholds a scene like this. My friends, alas! but they are all with thee, Not less in death, awful, mysterious God! Than when they flash'd their ineffectual steel. Thou art the Sovereignâthee must all obey!â When he had ended, and his lowly heart Confess'd to heaven, with penitential tears, His hollow vanity and impious hope, To build himself renown and monarchy, And make the agencies of God's own cause The aids and means of temporal designs, The Grace and Mercy, winged cherubims That hovering wait before the throne of light, Flutter'd their pinions, eager to receive The Hermit's pardon, and to earth came down, Bearing th' assurance of remitted sin; For heavenly spirits speed with joyous haste When sent to man with messages of bliss. Sooth'd and restor'd, as on the sward he sat, Sweet Mercy o'er him spread her gentle wings, And, beck'ning, drew the guardian angels nigh, That tend the pardon'd as they lie asleep. Then thick around, as far-come birds at sea, That sailors try with outstretch'd hands to clutch, They circling came, and on the saint alight. In that oblivious sleep and tranquil hour, A spirit rising from the cell of dreams Was with him, and he had the inward sense In symbols manifest of things to be, As if he stood upon a mountain's brow High overlooking all the world of time. Below him, kingdoms and their glory lay Extending to the limitless horizon. Bright streams that drew their links from upland plains, Came pouring from the bosom of dark woods; Their blue augmenting tides glassing the towers Of many a town that in the sunshine rear'd Her spiry head. The cliffy headlands stretch'd Towards the isles, and countless ships were seen All gaily glittering on a silver sea. But while he gazed, the phantom landscape changed, And high before him rose a lofty pile, So old, as if it had for ever stoodâ So strong, as if it would for ever stand. The top look'd over all the hills, and bore The sculptured images of mighty kings. But suddenly the skies were overcast, And hail and fire were shower'd with wrath from heaven. The hills gush'd torrents, and the rivers roll'd A gathering chaos as they rag'd along; The woods were crush'd before the roaring blast, As if some angry demon trampled them; An earthquake shook the mountains, and the sea Unclosed the trembling isles from his embrace, And seized them with a furious clasp again; Cities were overthrown, temples cast down; Castles did rock, and topple on their seats, The everlasting hills; altars were moved, And priests fled from their offerings; idols then Were, by their worshippers, cleft into stones, To build up ramparts; churches of the Lord, With all the pageantries of pomp and ritual, Melted away, like visions seen in ice, That are by sufferance of the absent sun, And vanish from his beam: all men were seized With an impetuous frenzy, and the codes Of olden wisdom, by fantastic hands Were torn as warranties of tyranny; The chalice and the charter were as one Witness and testimony, that mankind Were juggled with by man; the regal sceptre Became a sword all foul with gouts of blood; Shrieks rose afar, and blazing bulwarks burn'd; The halo vanish'd from the royal head; To helmets grim the sacred mitres grew; The lawn was dyed with murder, and lewd songs Blared from carousals held at sainted shrines, Where batter'd chalices with wine o'erflow'd; The ravenous vultures flesh'd their beaks and fangs On limbs they mangled; and the setting sun, Red in the west, darting disastrous fires, Foretold the doom and burial of the day. Again the vision changed: a brightening morn Dawn'd in the darkness that lay black on all, A heaven of glory, and another earth, Where white-robed saints in peace and holiness Knew but the code of Calvary, and ruled By it the calm dominions of the just. All there had tasks, for heaven is pleased with toil, The toil that's earnest, and ensures repose; Hard labour was unknown; the dreams of guilt, The restless couch of unappeased desire, The idle anguish of luxurious bowers, Lean Want that wrenches life from grasping Famine, And bloated Sloth that ever asks for more, Were there alike unknown: no weary sigh Did there satiety or need betoken, Nor there Voluptuousness was fluttering seen, A fated fly that sips empoison'd sweets, And in fastidious ecstasies expires, Loathed as cantharides: there man with man In goodness emulous, contented found Success from brotherhood still constant spring; Nor fenced woodland, nor the sunny lawn, Where well-fed Wealth, amidst green pasture lies, Were there, nor hovel of the rent-rack'd hind, Mix'd with the golden dome and lordly tower, But wisdom reign'd, and peace was ever blest. Calm from his trance the Hermit rose, and, sooth'd By Heav'n's sweet influence in the vision'd sleep, Mused of his dream, and what it might portend. The hurl and havoc of terrestrial things, He deem'd, betoken'd war, and storms, and change, 'Till all that's old, perish'd and overthrown, Whirl'd from the shuddering bosom of the earth, As ashes volleying on the winds disperse, Shall pass away; and for the surgeand battle, The halcyon days of holiness serene Shine on the world, and Christ preside o'er all, True glorious conqueror, his sword, the Truth! Then awed to think that with celestial aims He had the dross of human passion mix'd, The Hermit traced with pensive steps again His solemn mission to the western brave. THE BIRAM AT STAMBOUL. The dawn slow bright'ning up the eastern sky Chang'd the blue sapphire to pale chrysolite, The moon grew wan, the starry orbs on high Dwindled, and seem'd in their mid course to set; No breeze did then the slumb'ring Bosph'rus fret, But all was calm, save through the peaceful air The solemn muzzim from the minaret, Amidst the moonlike opal clusters there, Summon'd the faithful to the mosque and prayer. The light caique, Row-boats. with many a Christian guest From dusky Tophono, slow skimm'd to where Imperial Stamboul gemm'd her gorgeous breast, Waiting her paramour, the Sun, and bright Arch, roof, and dome, adorn'd her jewel'd crest, That morning tinted with her gladdening light, And martigans Barks. like birds prepared their wings for flight. A LEGEND OF ST ANTHONY. Saint Anthony dwelt in a cave, A hermit holy, good, and simpleâ Above the witch-guard row'n-trees wave, And prattling waters round him rimple; All happy in security, The mavis and the merle sing, The leverets play at liberty, And leaping light with gaiety, Chase the blue swallow's skimming wing. A scene so Eden-like and fair, The hermit from his cell surveying, Felt all his feelings prompt to prayer. Just then a wandering imp of air Flew past and heard him praying. Saint Anthony, as saints are wont, His strain repeated loud and strong, And ever and anon he paused To hear the hills the strain prolong. The imp of ill, as you may guess, In gamesome mood the saint to mock, Alighted in a still recess, And play'd the echo of the rock; While ever as the hermit paus'd, His last words sweetly swelling, The wicked imp took up the strain, And made a holy yelling. But still the saint, as saints should do, When fell malignants tempt to sin, More zealous in devotion grewâ The imp increased his din. So loud at last between them rose This rapturous endeavouring, That devils came in flocks like crows From regions far and near, Their friend unfairly favouring. But them the saint did nothing fear, Like a brave cock still crowing clear, Triumphantly he pray'd. The imp began to pant and fretâ Some laugh'd, some talk'd, and some did threat, And some did ban, and some did bet, The rest were sore dismay'd. 'Twas in this crisis of the game The old imperial tempter came;â âWhat, ho!â he cries, âwhat means this crowd? This praying long, this echoing loud? And shall not we the vict'ry claim?â Away, a gallant bounding buck, With branching horns he proudly spedâ The rest appear'd a hunter's train, Tumultuous sweeping o'er the plain Where'er the leader led. But rapt, regardless of the sight, The saint still pray'd with all his might. As foaming torrents roll their force Impetuous and disorderly, Down come the buck, and hounds, and horseâ The buck sheer o'er the hermit bounds, High leaping follow horse and hounds In hurly-burly furiously. âO, such a saint,â cried Beelzebub, âI never saw before, To pray so calm and steadily, His phrases flowing readily, Uncheck'd by such uproar.â But now another guise they take, The old one still them heading,â Like hinds and maidens, two and two, With pipe and tabor on they go, A merry village wedding. I need not tell who play'd the priest, With twinkling eyes and visage chubby; The pimple on his purple nose Was like the royal ruby. With blithe good-morrows as they pass, The pious saint they laughing hail, And jocundly they bid him come To see the happy couple homeâ But all, full well I wot, they found of no avail. Anon, in the pass of the mountains was heard The sound of bold trumpets and cymbals afar, And soon with bright eagle's high glittering appear'd An army all glorious advancing to war; While down the steep defiling, With drums and hautboys playing, You might have seen the glancing arms, And heard the chargers neighing. But who the pomp of this array shall paint, That near the cave magnificently pass'd? In the vain hope that heaven's devoted saint A wond'ring look would on the pageant cast. The bugles swell'd with a courageous blast, Th' inspir'd soldiers answer'd with a cheer, The firm earth shook, as heavily and vast Roll'd on the ordnance in the cumber'd rearâ The hermit rais'd his voice, and strove that all might hear. Soon tumultuous from afar Was heard the meeting tides of war Conflicting on the heathâ As Niagara's thunders roar, The headlong human torrents pour The cataracts of death. The battle loud and louder nears, And random balls and splinter'd spears, Hoarse curses, mingled groans and cheers, Come heralding the anarchy. Now rank on rank confusion drives, Dire as the volley'd thunder rives, The furious artillery strives 'Midst whirlwinds of cavalry. The wounded falling as they fly, Around the hermit gasping lie, âOh! water! water!â wild they cry, âOne drop for blessed charity.â Regardless of their piteous plaint, Serene the self-admiring saint Knelt obdurate in pray'r. Vindictive for this new disgrace, In shape a bomb from the mid air Satan exploded in his face. As a vapour dissolves into air, The phantom slow melting withdrew, And the landscape, all sunny and fair, Return'd to Saint Anthony's view. The flocks on the mountains reclined, The shepherds were stretched in sleep; It was noon, not a breathing of wind Stirr'd the tendrils that hung from the steep. In the cool shadow of his cot the swain Survey'd the cattle from the gadflies run, And knee-deep in the calm and glassy main, Their murmuring upland pastures shun. Then bright and proudly winding through the grass, As banded warriors greenwood alleys pass, Towards the saint a shining serpent roll'd; But vainly glared its sparkling eyes, In vain it shew'd a thousand dyes In every wind and fold; The hermit scorn'd the wily snake, And baffled Satan sprang into the brake. Then clouds began to gather, And gusts of rude wind stirr'd the sandâ Presaging stormy weather, The curlews came screaming to land. Afar in the horizon, With sails all silvery bright, Appears a stately vessel, Fast nearing on the sight; And in the broken sunshine That glimmers o'er the deep, Seems lighted the tall beacon That crowns the cliffy steep. Now black, voluminous, and dire, Fringed with fierce and crimson fire, The omens of the tempest wrap the skies, The mountains frownâthe yeasty billows rise. Dull sinks the sun towards the western gate, And on the vessel in the hermit's view, A wavering glance at her impending fate Shed through the clouds, and suddenly withdrew. Within the headlands of the bay, Where spring the spiry waves in spray, The vessel drives forlorn, And in the lighted beacon's beam Her sails in shreds loose fluttering gleam, All by the tempest torn. Now, down the pathway, near the cell, With hooks and cords, and purpose fell, And many a flaming brand, A savage herd, uncheck'd, unstay'd, Blaspheming, hurried to the strand; And still the saint regardless pray'd; Nor when the dread crash was heard on the shore, And the shrieks of the drowning burst shrill on his ear, Nor yet when arose the infernal uproar Of the plundering fiends in their murderous career, Moved his tongue from its chime, or his eye shed a tear. âWhat the devil,â cried the Devil, âHave we all been about, Not to tempt him with a woman?â All the Devils gave a shout, And clapt their paws with rapture fain, Sure now the victory to gain. Straight on the grass extended lies A glowing, ripe, voluptuous fair, Her limbs are restless, and her longing sighs Temper the soft embracing air. The hermit felt the influence warm, And strange emotions urge his blood; Around the expecting devils swarm, And Beelzebub on tiptoe stood. Again the damsel turns, And quicker breathes her sighsâ The Devil gloatsâSaint AnthonyâSaint Anthony!â The saint has closed his eyes! Meek, humbled, trembling and contrite, He pray'd for strength against temptation, And all the devils took to flightâ So ended this probation; While from the hamlet in the dale A silvan flute its vocal sweetness sent, And from her bower the wakeful nightingale Her sweeter cadences symphonious lent. If it be any merit, the foregoing was written in Greece, partly in Athens, long ago. The attempt began in a description, from recollection, of one of Teniers' hobgoblin temptations of St Anthony.</field>
