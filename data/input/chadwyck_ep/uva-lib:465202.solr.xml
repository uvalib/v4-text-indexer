      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE AUTHOR'S APOLOGY. My Works are advertis'd for sale, And censures fly as thick as hail; While my poor scheme of publication Supplies the dearth of conversation. What will the World say?—That's your cry. Who is the World? and what am I? Once, but thank heaven, those days are o'er, And persecution reigns no more, One man, one hardy man alone, Usurp'd the critic's vacant throne, And thence with neither taste nor wit, By powerful catcall from the pit, Knock'd farce, and play, and actor down. Who pass'd the sentence then?—the Town. So now each upstart puny elf Talks of the world, and means himself. Yet in the circle there are those Who hurt e'en more than open foes: Whose friendship serves the talking turn, Just simmers to a kind concern, And with a wond'rous soft expression Expatiates upon indiscretion; Flies from the Poems to the Man, And gratifies the favourite plan To pull down other's reputation, And build their own on that foundation. The scholar grave, of taste discerning, Who lives on credit for his learning, And has no better claim to wit Than carping at what others writ, With pitying kindness, friendly fear, Whispers conjectures in your ear. “I'm sorry—and he's much to blame— “He might have publish'd—but his name! “The thing might please a few, no doubt, “As handed privately about— “It might amuse a friend or two, “Some partial friend like me and you; “But when it comes to press and print “You'll find, I fear, but little in't. “He stands upon a dangerous brink “Who totters o'er the sea of ink, “Where reputation runs aground, “The author cast away, and drown'd. “And then—'twas wilful and absurd, “(So well approv'd, so well preferr'd,) “Abruptly thus a place to quit “A place which most his genius hit, “The theatre for Latin wit! “With critics round him chaste and terse, “To give a plaudit to his verse! Latin, I grant, shews college breeding, And some school-common-place of reading. But has in Moderns small pretension To real wit or strong invention. The excellence you critics praise Hangs on a curious choice of phrase; Which pick'd and chosen here and there, From prose or verse no matter where, Jumbled together in a dish, Like Spanish olio, fowl, flesh, fish, You set the classic hodge-podge on For pedant wits to feed upon. Your wou'd-be Genii vainly seek Fame from their Latin verse, or Greek; Who would for that be most admir'd Which blockheads may, and have acquir'd, A mere mechanical connection Of favourite words,—a bare collection Of phrases,—where the labour'd cento Presents you with a dull memento, How Virgil, Horace, Ovid join, And club together half a line. These only strain their motly wits In gathering patches, shreds, and bits, To wrap their barren fancies in, And make a classic Harlequin. —Were I at once impower'd to shew My utmost vengeance on my foe, To punish with extremest rigour, I could inflict no penance bigger Than using him as learning's tool To make him Usher of a school. For, not to dwell upon the toil Of working on a barren soil, And lab'ring with incessant pains To cultivate a blockhead's brains, The duties there but ill befit The love of letters, arts, or wit. For whosoe'er, tho' slightly, sips, Their grateful flavour with his lips, Will find it leave a smatch behind, Shall sink so deeply in the mind, It never thence can be eras'd— But, rising up, you call it Taste. 'Twere foolish for a drudge to chuse A gusto which he cannot use. Better discard the idle whim, What's He to Taste? or Taste to Him? For me, it hurts me to the soul To brook confinement or controul; Still to be pinion'd down to teach The syntax and the parts of speech; Or, what perhaps is drudging worse, The links, and joints, and rules of verse; To deal out authors by retale, Like penny pots of Oxford ale; —Oh! 'Tis a service irksome more Than tugging at the slavish oar. Yet such his task, a dismal truth, Who watches o'er the bent of youth; And while, a paltry stipend earning, He sows the richest seeds of learning, And tills their minds with proper care, And sees them their due produce bear, No joys, alas! his toil beguile, His own lies fallow all the while. “Yet still he's in the road, you say, “Of learning.”—Why, perhaps he may. But turns like horses in a mill, Nor getting on, nor standing still: For little way his learning reaches, Who reads no more than what he teaches. “Yet you can send advent'rous youth, “In search of letters, taste, and truth, “Who ride the highway road to knowledge “Through the plain turnpikes of a college,” True.—Like way-posts, we serve to shew The road which travellers shou'd go; Who jog along in easy pace, Secure of coming to the place, Yet find, return whene'er they will, The Post, and its direction still: Which stands an useful unthank'd guide, To many a passenger beside. 'Tis hard to carve for others meat, And not have time one's self to eat. Tho', be it always understood, Our appetites are full as good. “But there have been, and proofs appear, “Who bore this load from year to year; “Whose claim to letters, parts, and wit, “The world has ne'er disputed yet. “Whether the flowing mirth prevail “In Wesley's song, or humorous tale; “Or happier Bourne's expression please “With graceful turns of classic ease; “Or Oxford's well-read poet sings “Pathetic to the ear of kings: “These have indulg'd the muses' flight, “Nor lost their time or credit by't; “Nor suffer'd fancy's dreams to prey “On the due business of the day. “Verse was to them a recreation “Us'd but by way of relaxation.” Your instances are fair and true, And genius I respect with you. I envy none their honest praise; I seek to blast no scholar's bays: Still let the graceful foliage spread Its greenest honours round their head, Blest, if the Muses' hand entwine A sprig at least to circle mine! Come,—I admit, you tax me right. Prudence, 'tis true, was out of sight, And you may whisper all you meet, The man was vague and indiscreet. Yet tell me, while you censure me, Are you from error sound and free? Say, does your breast no bias hide, Whose influence draws the mind aside? All have their hobby-horse, you see, From Tristram down to you and me. Ambition, splendour, may be thine; Ease, indolence, perhaps, are mine. Though prudence, and our nature's pride May wish our weaknesses to hide, And set their hedges up before 'em, Some Sprouts will branch, and straggle o'er 'em. Strive, fight against her how you will, Nature will be the mistress still, And though you curb with double rein, She'll run away with us again. But let a man of parts be wrong, 'Tis triumph to the leaden throng. The fools shall cackle out reproof, The very ass shall raise his hoof; And he who holds in his possession, The single virtue of discretion, Who knows no overflow of spirit, Whose want of passions is his merit, Whom wit and taste and judgment flies, Shall shake his noddle, and seem wise. THE ACTOR. ADDRESSED TO BONNEL THORNTON, ESQ. Acting, dear Thornton, its perfection draws From no observance of mechanic laws: No settled maxims of a fav'rite stage, No rules deliver'd down from age to age, Let players nicely mark them as they will, Can e'er entail hereditary skill. If, 'mongst the humble hearers of the pit, Some curious vet'ran critic chance to sit, Is he pleased more because 'twas acted so By Booth and Cibber thirty years ago? The mind recals an object held more dear, And hates the copy, that it comes so near. Why lov'd he Wilks's air, Booth's nervous tone? In them 'twas natural, 'twas all their own. A Garrick's genius must our wonder raise, But gives his mimic no reflected praise. Thrice happy Genius, whose unrival'd name, Shall live for ever in the voice of Fame! 'Tis thine to lead with more than magic skill, The train of captive passions at thy will; To bid the bursting tear spontaneous flow In the sweet sense of sympathetic woe: Through ev'ry vein I feel a chilness creep, When horrors such as thine bave murder'd sleep; And at the old man's look and frantic stare 'Tis Lear alarms me, for I see him there. Nor yet confin'd to tragic walks alone, The Comic Muse too claims thee for her own. With each delightful requisite to please, Taste, Spirit, Judgment, Elegance, and Ease, Familiar Nature forms thy only rule, From Ranger's rake to Drugger's vacant fool. With powers so pliant, and so various blest, That what we see the last, we like the best. Not idly pleas'd, at judgment's dear expence, But burst outrageous with the laugh of sense. Perfection's top, with weary toil and pain, 'Tis genius only that can hope to gain. The Play'r's profession (tho' I hate the phrase, 'Tis so mechanic in these modern days) Lies not in trick, or attitude, or start, Nature's true knowledge is the only art. The strong-felt passion bolts into his face, The mind untouch'd, what is it but grimace? To this one standard make your just appeal, Here lies the golden secret; learn to feel. Or fool, or monarch, happy, or distrest, No actor pleases that is not possess'd. Once on the stage, in Rome's declining days, When Christians were the subject of their plays, E'er persecution dropp'd her iron rod, And men still wag'd an impious war with God, An actor flourish'd of no vulgar fame, Nature's disciple, and Genest his name. A noble object for his skill he chose, A martyr dying 'midst insulting foes. Resign'd with patience to religion's laws, Yet braving monarchs in his Saviour's cause. Fill'd with th' idea of the sacred part, He felt a zeal beyond the reach of art, While look and voice, and gesture, all exprest A kindred ardour in the player's breast; Till as the flame thro' all his bosom ran, He lost the Actor, and commenc'd the Man; Profest the faith; his pagan gods denied, And what he acted then, he after died. The Player's province they but vainly try, Who want these pow'rs, Deportment, Voice, and Eye. The Critic Sight 'tis only Grace can please, No figure charms us if it has not Ease. There are, who think the stature all in all, Nor like the hero, if he is not tall. The feeling sense all other want supplies, I rate no actor's merit from his size. Superior height requires superior grace, And what's a giant with a vacant face? Theatric monarchs, in their tragic gait, Affect to mark the solemn pace of state. One foot put forward in position strong, The other, like its vassal, dragg'd along. So grave each motion, so exact and slow, Like wooden monarchs at a puppet show. The mein delights us that has native grace, But affectation ill supplies its place. Unskilful actors, like your mimic apes, Will writhe their bodies in a thousand shapes; However foreign from the poet's art, No tragic hero but admires a start. What though unfeeling of the nervous line, Who but allows his attitude is fine? While a whole minute equipois'd he stands, Till praise dismiss him with her echoing hands! Resolv'd, though nature hate the tedious pause, By perseverance to extort applause. When Romeo sorrowing at his Juliet's doom, With eager madness bursts the canvas tomb, The sudden whirl, stretch'd leg, and lifted staff, Which please the vulgar, make the critic laugh. To paint the passion's force, and mark it well, The proper action nature's self will tell; No pleasing pow'rs distortions e'er express, And nicer judgment always loaths excess. In sock or buskin, who o'erleaps the bounds, Disgusts our reason, and the taste confounds. Of all the evils which the stage molest, I hate your fool who overacts his jest; Who murders what the poet finely writ, And, like a bungler, haggles all his wit, With shrug, and grin, and gesture out of place, And writes a foolish comment with his face. Old Johnson once, tho' Cibber's perter vein But meanly groupes him with a num'rous train, With steady face, and sober hum'rous mein, Fill'd the strong outlines of the comic scene, What was writ down, with decent utt'rance spoke, Betray'd no symptom of the conscious joke; The very man in look, in voice, in air, And tho' upon the stage, appear'd no Play'r. The word and action should conjointly suit, But acting words is labour too minute. Grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong; While sober humour marks th' impression strong. Her proper traits the fixt attention hit, And bring me closer to the poet's wit; With her delighted o'er each scene I go, Well-pleas'd, and not asham'd of being so. But let the generous Actor still forbear To copy features with a Mimic's care! 'Tis a poor skill which ev'ry fool can reach, A vile stage-custom, honour'd in the breach. Worse as more close, the disingenuous art But shews the wanton looseness of the heart. When I behold a wretch, of talents mean, Drag private foibles on the public scene, Forsaking nature's fair and open road To mark some whim, some strange peculiar mode, Fir'd with disgust I loath his servile plan, Despise the mimic, and abhor the man. Go to the lame, to hospitals repair, And hunt for humour in distortions there! Fill up the measure of the motley whim With shrug, wink, snuffle, and convulsive limb; Then shame at once, to please a trifling age, Good sense, good manners, virtue, and the stage! 'Tis not enough the Voice be sound and clear, 'Tis modulation that must charm the ear. When desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan, And whine their sorrows in a see-saw tone, The same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes Can only make the yawning hearers doze. The voice all modes of passion can express; That marks the proper word with proper stress. But none emphatic can that actor call, Who lays an equal emphasis on all. Some o'er the tongue the labour'd measures roll Slow and delib'rate as the parting toll, Point ev'ry stop, mark ev'ry pause so strong, Their words, like stage-processions stalk along. All affectation but creates disgust, And e'en in speaking we may seem too just. Nor proper, Thornton, can those sounds appear Which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear; In vain for them the pleasing measure flows, Whose recitation runs it all to prose; Repeating what the poet sets not down, The verb disjointing from its friendly noun, While pause, and break, and repetition join To make a discord in each tuneful line. Some placid natures sill th' allotted scene With lifeless drone, insipid and serene; While others thunder ev'ry couplet o'er, And almost crack your ears with rant and roar. More nature oft and finer strokes are shown, In the low whisper than tempestuous tone. And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixt amaze, More powerful terror to the mind conveys, Than he, who, swol'n with big impetuous rage, Bullies the bulky phantom off the stage. He, who in earnest studies o'er his part, Will find true nature cling about his heart. The modes of grief are not included all In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl; A single look more marks th' internal woe, Than all the windings of the lengthen'd Oh. Up to the Face the quick sensation flies, And darts its meaning from the speaking Eyes; Love, transport, madness, anger, scorn, despair, And all the passions, all the soul is there. In vain Ophelia gives her flowrets round, And with her straws fantastic strews the ground, In vain now sings, now heaves the desp'rate sigh, If phrenzy sit not in the troubled eye. In Cibber's look commanding sorrows speak, And call the tear fast trick'ling down my cheek. There is a fault which stirs the critic's rage; A want of due attention on the stage. I have seen actors, and admir'd ones too, Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue; In their own speech who whine, or roar away, Yet seem unmov'd at what the rest may say; Whose eyes and thoughts on diff'rent objects roam, Until the prompter's voice recal them home. Divest yourself of hearers, if you can, And strive to speak, and be the very man. Why should the well-bred actor wish to know Who sits above to-night, or who below? So, mid th' harmonious tones of grief or rage, Italian squallers oft disgrace the stage; When, with a simp'ring leer, and bow profound, The squeaking Cyrus greets the boxes round; Or proud Mandane, of imperial race, Familiar drops a curt'sie to her grace. To suit the dress demands the actor's art, Yet there are those who over-dress the part. To some prescriptive right gives settled things, Black wigs to mutd'rers, feather'd hats to kings. But Michael Cassio might be drunk enough, Tho' all his features were not grim'd with snuff. Why shou'd Pol Peachum shine in satin cloaths? Why ev'ry devil dance in scarlet hose? But in stage-customs what offends me most Is the slip-door, and slowly-rising ghost. Tell me, nor count the question too severe, Why need the dismal powder'd forms appear? When chilling horrors shake th' affrighted king, And guilt torments him with her scorpion sting; When keenest feelings at his bosom pull, And fancy tells him that the seat is full; Why need the ghost usurp the monarch's place, To frighten children with his mealy face? The king alone shou'd form the phantom there, And talk and tremble at the vacant chair. If Belvidera her lov'd loss deplore, Why for twin spectres bursts the yawning floor? When with disorder'd starts, and horrid cries, She paints the murder'd forms before her eyes, And still pursues them with a frantic stare, 'Tis pregnant madness brings the visions there. More instant horror would enforce the scene, If all her shudd'rings were at shapes unseen. Poet and Actor thus, with blended skill, Mould all our passions to their instant will; 'Tis thus, when feeling Garrick treads the stage, (The speaking comment of his Shakespear's page) Oft as I drink the words with greedy ears, I shake with horror, or dissolve with tears. O, ne'er may folly seize the throne of taste, Nor dulness lay the realms of genius waste! No bouncing crackers ape the thund'rer's sire, No tumbler float upon the bending wire! More natural uses to the stage belong, Than tumblers, monsters, pantomime, or song. For other purpose was that spot design'd: To purge the passions, and resorm the mind, To give to nature all the force of art, And while it charms the ear to mend the heart. Thornton, to thee, I dare with truth commend, The decent stage as virtue's natural friend. Tho' oft debas'd with scenes profane and loose, No reason weighs against it's proper use. Tho' the lewd priest his sacred function shame, Religion's perfect law is still the same. Shall They, who trace the passions from their rise, Shew scorn her features, her own image vice? Who teach the mind it's proper force to scan, And hold the faithful mirror up to man, Shall their prosession e'er provoke disdain, Who stand the foremost in the moral train, Who lend reflection all the grace of art, And strike the precept home upon the heart? Yet, hapless Artist! tho' thy skill can raise The bursting peal of universal praise, Tho' at thy beck Applause delighted stands, And lifts, Briareus' like, her hundred hands, Know, Fame awards thee but a partial breath! Not all thy talents brave the stroke of death. Poets to ages yet unborn appeal, And latest times th' Eternal Nature feel. Tho' blended here the praise of bard and play'r, While more than half becomes the Actor's share, Relentless death untwists the mingled fame, And sinks the player in the poet's name. The pliant muscles of the various face, The mein that gave each sentence strength and grace, The tuneful voice, the eye that spoke the mind, Are gone, nor leave a single trace behind. THE LAW STUDENT. TO GEORGE COLMAN, ESQ. Quid tibi cum Cirrbâ? quid cum Permessidos undâ? Romanum propius divitiusque Forum est. Mart. Now Christ-Church left, and fixt at Lincoln's Inn, Th' important studies of the Law begin. Now groan the shelves beneath th' unusual charge Of Records, Statutes, and Reports at large. Each Classic Author seeks his peaceful nook, And modest Virgil yields his place to Coke. No more, ye Bards, for vain precedence hope, But even Jacob take the lead of Pope! While the pil'd shelves sink down on one another, And each huge folio has its cumb'rous brother, While, arm'd with these, the Student views with awe His rooms become the magazine of Law, Say whence so few succeed? where thousands aim, So few e'er reach the promis'd goal of fame? Say, why Cæcilius quits a gainful trade For regimentals, sword, and smart cockade? Or Sextus why his first profession leaves For narrower band, plain shirt, and pudding sleeves? The depth of law asks study, thought, and care? Shall we seek these in rich Alonzo's heir? Such diligence, alas! is seldom found In the brisk heir to forty thousand pound. Wealth, that excuses folly, sloth creates, Few, who can spend, e'er learn to get estates. What is to him dry case, or dull report, Who studies fashions at the Inns of Court; And proves that thing of emptiness and show, That mungrel, half-form'd thing, a Temple-Beau? Observe him daily saunt'ring up and down, In purple slippers, and in silken gown; Last night's debauch, his morning conversation; The coming, all his evening preparation. By Law let others toil to gain renown! Florio's a gentleman, a man o'th' town. He nor courts, clients, or the law regarding, Hurries from Nando's down to Covent-Garden: Yet he's a Scholar;—mark him in the Pit With critic catcall sound the stops of wit! Supreme at George's he harangues the throng, Censor of stile from tragedy to song: Him ev'ry witling views with secret awe, Deep in the Drama, shallow in the Law. Others there are, who, indolent and vain, Contemn the science, they can ne'er attain: Who write, and read, but all by sits and starts, And varnish folly with the name of Parts; Trust all to Genius, for they scorn to pore, Till e'en that little Genius is no more. Knowledge in Law care only can attain, Where honour's purchas'd at the price of pain. If, loit'ring, up th' ascent you cease to climb, No starts of labour can redeem the time. Industrious study wins by slow degrees, True sons of Coke can ne'er be sons of ease. There are, whom Love of Poetry has smit, Who, blind to interest, arrant dupes to wit, Have wander'd devious in the pleasing road, With Attic flowers and Classic wreaths bestrew'd: Wedded to verse, embrac'd the Muse for life, And ta'en, like modern bucks, their whores to wife. Where'er the Muse usurps despotic sway, All other studies must of force give way. Int'rest in vain puts in her prudent claim, Nonsuited by the pow'rful plea of fame. As well you might weigh lead against a feather, As ever jumble wit and law together. On Littleton Coke gravely thus remarks, (Remember this, ye rhyming Temple Sparks! “In all our author's tenures, be it noted, “This is the fourth time any verse is quoted.” Which, 'gainst the Muse and verse, may well imply What lawyers call a noli prosequi. Quit then, dear George, O quit the barren field, Which neither profit nor reward can yield! What tho' the sprightly scene, well acted, draws From unpack'd Englishmen unbrib'd applause, Some Monthly Grub, some Dennis of the age, In print cries shame on the degen'rate stage See the very curious and very similar criticisms on the comedy of the Jealous Wife, in the two Reviews, together with the most malicious and insolent attack on the writer, and the author of this Collection in the Critical Review for March; an injury poorly repaired by a lame apology in the Review for the succeeding month, containing fresh insults on one of the injured parties. If haply Churchill strive with generous aim, To fan the sparks of genius to a flame; If all unask'd, unknowing, and unknown, By noting thy desert, he prove his own; Envy shall strait to Hamilton's repair, And vent her spleen, and gall, and venom there, Thee, and thy works, and all thy friends decry, And boldly print and publish a rank lie, Swear your own hand the flatt'ring likeness drew, Swear your own breath fame's partial trumpet blew. Well I remember oft your friends have said, (Friends, whom the surest maxims ever led) Turn parson, Colman, that's the way to thrive: Your parsons are the happiest men alive. Judges, there are but twelve, and never more, But Stalls untold, and Bishops, twenty-four. Of pride and claret, sloth and ven'son full, Yon prelate mark, right reverend and dull! He ne'er, good man, need pensive vigils keep To preach his audience once a week to sleep; On rich preferments battens at his ease, Nor sweats for tithes, as lawyers toil for fees. Thus they advis'd. I know thee better far; And cry, stick close, dear Colman, to the Bar! If genius warm thee, where can genius call For nobler action than in yonder hall? 'Tis not enough each morn, on Term's approach, To club your legal threepence for a coach; Then at the Hall to take your filent stand, With ink-horn and long note-book in your hand, Marking grave serjeants cite each wise report, And noting down sage dictums from the court, With overwhelming brow, and law-learn'd face, The index of your book of common-place. These are mere drudges, that can only plod, And tread the path their dull forefathers trod, Doom'd thro' law's maze, without a clue, to range, From second Vernon down to second Strange. Do Thou uplift thine eyes to happier wits! Dulness no longer on the woolpack sits; No longer on the drawling dronish herd Are the first honours of the law confer'd; But they whose fame reward's due tribute draws, Whose active merit challenges applause, Like glorious beacons, are set high to view, To mark the paths which genius shou'd persue. O for thy spirit, Mansfield! at thy name What bosom glows not with an active flame? Alone from Jargon born to rescue Law, From precedent, grave hum, and formal saw! To strip chican'ry of its vain pretence, And marry Common Law to Common Sense! Pratt! on thy lips persuasion ever hung! English falls, pure as Manna, from thy tongue: On thy voice truth may rest, and on thy plea Unerring Henley found the just decree. Henley! than whom, to Hardwick's wellrais'd fame, No worthier second Roya! George cou'd name: No lawyer of prerogative; no too! Fashion'd in black corruption's pliant school; Form'd 'twixt the People and the Crown to stand, And hold the scales of right with even hand! True to our hopes, and equal to his birth, See, see in York the force of lineal worth! But why their sev'ral merits need I tell? Why on each honour'd sage's praises dwell? Wilmot how well his place, or Foster fills? Or shrew'd sense beaming from the eye of Wills? Such, while thou see'st the public care engage, Their fame increasing with increasing age, Rais'd by true genius, bred in Phœbus' school, Whose warmth of soul sound judgment knew to cool; —With such illustrious proofs before your eyes, Think not, my friend, you've too much wit to rise: Think of the bench, the coif, long robe, and fee, And leave the Press to ? THE POETRY PROFESSORS. Old England has not lost her pray'r, And George, (thank heav'n!) has got an heir. A royal babe, a Prince of Wales. —Poets! I pity all your nails—— What reams of paper will be spoil'd! What graduses be daily soil'd By inky fingers, greasy thumbs, Hunting the word that never comes! Now Academics pump their wits, And lash in vain their lazy tits; In vain they whip, and slash, and spur, The callous jades will never stir; Nor can they reach Parnassus' hill, Try every method which they will. Nay, should the tits get on for once, Each rider is so grave a dunce, That, as I've heard good judges say, 'Tis ten to one they'd lose their way; Tho' not one wit bestrides the back Of useful drudge, ycleped hack, But fine bred things of mettled blood, Pick'd from Apollo's royal stud. Greek, Roman, nay Arabian steeds, Or those our mother country breeds; Some ride ye in, and ride ye out, And to come home go round about, Nor on the green swerd, nor the road, And that I think they call an Ode. Some take the pleasant country air, And smack their whips and drive a pair, Each horse with bells which clink and chime, And so they march—and that is rhime. Some copy with prodigious skill The figures of a buttery-bill, Which, with great folks of erudition, Shall pass for Coptic or Phœnician. While some, as patriot love prevails, To compliment a prince of Wales, Salute the royal babe in Welsh, And send forth gutturals like a belch. What pretty things imagination Will fritter out in adulation! The Pagan Gods shall visit earth, To triumph in a Christian's birth. While classic poets, pure and chaste, Of trim and academic taste, Shall lug them in by head and shoulders, To be or speakers, or beholders. Mars shall present him with a lance, To humble Spain and conquer France; The Graces, buxom, blith, and gay, Shall at his cradle dance the Hay; And Venus, with her train of Loves, Shall bring a thousand pair of doves To bill, to coo, to whine, to squeak, Through all the dialect; of Greek. How many swains of classic breed, Shall deftly tune their oaten reed, And bring their Doric nymphs to town, To sing their measures up and down, In notes alternate clear and sweet, Like Ballad-singers in a street. While those who grasp at reputation, From imitating imitation, Shall hunt each cranny, nook, and creek, For precious fragments in the Greek, And rob the spital, and the waste, For sense, and sentiment, and taste. What Latin hodge-podge, Grecian hash, With Hebrew roots, and English trash, Shall academic cooks produce For present show and future use! Fellows! who've soak'd away their knowledge, In sleepy residence at college; Whose lives are like a stagnant pool, Muddy and placid, dull and cool; Mere drinking, eating; eating, drinking; With no impertinence of thinking; Who lack no farther erudition, Than just to set an imposition To cramp, demolish, and dispirit, Each true begotten child of merit; Censors, who, in the day's broad light, Punish the vice they act at night; Whose charity with self begins, Nor covers others venial sins; But that their feet may safely tread, Take up hypocrisy instead, As knowing that must always hide A multitude of sins beside; Whose rusty wit is at a stand, Without a freshman at their hand; (Whose service must of course create The just return of sev'n-fold hate) Lord! that such good and useful men Should ever turn to books agen. Yet matter must be gravely plann'd, And syllables on fingers scann'd, And racking pangs rend lab'ring head, Till lady Muse is brought to-bed: What hunting, changing, toiling, sweating, To bring the useful epithet in! Where the crampt measure kindly shows It will be verse, but should be prose. So, when its neither light nor dark, To 'prentice spruce, or lawyer's clerk, The nymph, who takes her nightly stand At some sly corner in the Strand, Plump in the chest, tight in the boddice, Seems to the eye a perfect goddess; But canvass'd more minutely o'er, Turns out an old, stale, batter'd whore. Yet must these sons of gowned ease, Proud of the plumage of Degrees, Forsake their apathy a while, To figure in the Roman stile, And offer incense at the shrine Of Latin Poetry Divine. Upon a throne the goddess sits, Surrounded by her bulky wits; Fabricius, Cooper, Calepine, Ainsworthius, Faber, Constantine; And he, who like Dodona spoke, De Sacra Quercu, Holyoake; These are her counsellors of state, Men of much words, and wits of weight; Here Gradus, full of phrases clever, Lord of her treasury for ever, With liberal hand his bounty deals; Sir Cento Keeper of the Seals. Next to the person of the queen, Old madam Prosody is seen; Talking incessant, altho' dumb, Upon her fingers to her thumb. And all around are portaits hung Of heroes in the Latin Tongue; Italian, English, German, French, Who most laboriously entrench In deep parade of language dead, What would not in their own be read, Without impeachment of that Taste, Which Latin Idiom turns to chaste. Santolius here, whose flippant joke, Sought refuge in a Roman cloak: With dull Commirius at his side, In all the pomp of jesuit pride. Menage, the pedant figur'd there, A trifler with a solemn air: And there in loose, unseemly view, The graceless, easy Loveling too. 'Tis here grave poets urge their claim, For some thin blast of tiny fame; Here bind their temples drunk with praise, With half a sprig of wither'd bays. O poet, if that honour'd name Befits such idle childish aim; If Virgil ask thy sacred care, If Horace charm thee, oh forbear To spoil with sacrilegious hand, The glories of the classic land: Nor sow thy dowlas on the Sattin, Of their pure uncorrupted Latin. Better be native in thy verse,— What is Fingal but genuine Erse? Which all sublime sonorous flows, Like Hervey's thoughts in drunken prose. Hail, Scotland, hail, to thee belong All pow'rs, but most the pow'rs of song; Whether the rude unpolish'd Erse Stalk in the buckram Prose or Verse, Or bonny Ramsay please thee mo', Who sang sae sweetly aw his woe. If ought (and say who knows so well) The second-sighted Muse can tell, Thy happy Lairds shall laugh and sing, When England's Genius droops his wing. So shall thy soil new wealth disclose, So thy own Thistle choak the Rose But what comes here? Methinks I see A walking university. See how they press to cross the Tweed, And strain their limbs with eager speed! While Scotland, from her fertile shore, Cries, On my sons, return no more. Hither they haste with willing mind, Nor cast one longing look behind; On ten-toe carriage to salute, The k??g, and q?n, and Earl of Bute. No more the gallant Northern sons Spout forth their strings of Latin puns; Nor course all languages to frame, The quibble suited to their name; As when their ancestors be-vers'd, That glorious Stuart, James the first. But with that elocution's grace, That oratorial flashy Lace, Which the fam'd Irish Tommy Puff, Would sow on sentimental stuff; Twang with a sweet pronunciation, The flow'rs of bold imagination. Macpherson leads the flaming van, Laird of the new Fingalian clan; While Jacky Home brings up the rear, With new-got pension neat and clear Three hundred English pounds a year. While sister Peg, our ancient Friend, Sends Mac's and Donld's without end; To George awhile they tune their lays, Then all their choral voices raise, To heap their panegyric wit on Th' illustrious chief, and our North Briton. Hail to the Thane, whose patriot skill Can break all nations to his will; Master of sciences and arts, Mæcenas to all men of parts; Whose fost'ring hand, and ready wit, Shall find us all in places fit; So shall thy friends no longer roam, But change to meet a settled home. Hail mighty Thane, for Scotland born, To fill her almost empty horn: Hail to thy ancient glorious stem, Not they from Kings, but Kings from Them. THE CIT'S COUNTRY BOX, 1757. Vos sapere &amp; solos aio bene vivere, quorum, Conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis. Hor. The wealthy Cit, grown old in trade, Now wishes for the rural shade, And buckles to his one-horse chair, Old Dobbin, or the founder'd mare; While wedg'd in closely by his side, Sits Madam, his unwieldy bride, With Jacky on a stool before 'em, And out they jog in due decorum. Scarce past the turnpike half a mile, How all the country seems to smile! And as they slowly jog together, The Cit commends the road and weather; While Madam doats upon the trees, And longs for ev'ry house she sees, Admires its views, its situation, And thus she opens her oration. What signify the loads of wealth, Without that richest jewel, health? Excuse the fondness of a wife, Who doats upon your precious life! Such easeless toil, such constant care, Is more than human strength can bear. One may observe it in your face— Indeed, my dear, you break apace: And nothing can your health repair, But exercise and country air. Sir Traffic has a house, you know, About a mile from Cheney-Row; He's a good man, indeed 'tis true, But not so warm, my dear, as you: And folks are always apt to sneer— One would not be out-done my dear! Sir Traffic's name so well apply'd Awak'd his brother merchant's pride; And Thrifty, who had all his life Paid utmost deference to his wife, Confess'd her arguments had reason, And by th' approaching summer season, Draws a few hundreds from the stocks, And purchases his Country Box. Some three or four mile out of town, (An hour's ride will bring you down,) He fixes on his choice abode, Not half a furlong from the road: And so convenient does it lay, The stages pass it ev'ry day: And then so snug, so mighty pretty, To have an house so near the city! Take but your places at the Boar You're set down at the very door. Well then, suppose them fix'd at last, White-washing, painting, scrubbing past, Hugging themselves in ease and clover, With all the fuss of moving over; Lo, a new heap of whims are bred! And wanton in my lady's head. Well to be sure, it must be own'd, It is a charming spot of ground; So sweet a distance for a ride, And all about so countrified! 'Twould come but to a trifling price To make it quite a paradise; I cannot bear those nasty rails, Those ugly broken mouldy pales: Suppose, my dear, instead of these, We build a railing, all Chinese. Although one hates to be expos'd; 'Tis dismal to be thus inclos'd; One hardly any object sees— I wish you'd fell those odious trees. Objects continual passing by Were something to amuse the eye, But to be pent within the walls— One might as well be at St. Paul's. Our house, beholders would abore, Was there a level lawn before, Nothing its views to incommode, But quite laid open to the road; While ev'ry trav'ler in amaze, Should on our little mansion gaze, And pointing to the choice retreat, Cry, that's Sir Thrifty's Country Seat. No doubt her arguments prevail, For Madam's taste can never fail. Blest age! when all men may procure, The title of a Connoilffeur; When noble and ignoble herd, Are govern'd by a fingle word; Though, like the royal German dames, It bears an hundred Christian names; As Genius, Fancy, Judgement, Goût, Whim, Caprice, Je-ne-scai-quoi, Virtù: Which appellations all describe Taste, and the modern tasteful tribe. Now bricklay'rs, carpenters, and joiners, With Chinese artists, and designers, Produce their schemes of alteration, To work this wond'rous reformation. The useful dome, which secret stood, Embosom'd in the yew-tree's wood, The trav'ler with amazement sees A temple, Gothic, or Chinese, With many a bell, and tawdry rag on, And crested with a sprawling dragon; A wooden arch is bent astride A ditch of water, four foot wide, With angles, curves, and zigzag lines, From Halfpenny's exact designs. In front, a level lawn is seen, Without a sbrub upon the green, Where Taste would want its first great law, But for the skulking, sly ba-ba, By whose miraculous affistance, You gain a prospect two fields diftance. And now from Hyde-Park Corner come The Gods of Athens, and of Rome. Here squabby Cupids take their places, With Venus, and the clumsy Graces: Apollo there, with aim so clever, Stretches his leaden bow for ever; And there, without the pow'r to fly, Stands fix'd a tip-toe Mercury. The villa thus completely grac'd, All own that Thrifty has a Taste; And Madam's female friends, and cousins, With common-council-men, by dozens, Flock every Sunday to the Seat, To stare about them, and to eat. GENIUS, ENVY, AND TIME, A FABLE; ADDRESSED TO WILLIAM HOGARTH, ESQ; In all professionary skill, There never was, nor ever will Be excellence, or exhibition, But fools are up in opposition; Each letter'd, grave, pedantic dunce Wakes from his lethargy at once, Shrugs, shakes his head, and rubs his eyes, And, being dull, looks wond'rous wise, With solemn phiz, and critic scowl, The wisdom of his brother owl. Moderns! He hates the very name; Your Antients have prescriptive claim:— But let a century be past, And We have taste and wit at last; For at that period Moderns too Just turn the corner of Virtu. But merit now has little claim To any meed of present fame, For 'tis not worth that gets you friends, 'Tis excellence that most offends. If, Proteus-like, a Garrick's art, Shews taste and skill in every part; If, ever just to nature's plan, He is in all the very man, E'en here shall Envy take her aim, ? write, and ? blame. The Jealous Wife, tho' chastly writ, With no parade of frippery wit, Shall set a scribbling, all at once, Both giant wit, and pigmy dunce; While Critical Reviewers write, Who shew their teeth before they bite, And sacrifice each reputation, From wanton false imagination. These observations, rather stale, May borrow spirit from a tale. Genius, a bustling lad of parts, Who all things did by fits and starts, Nothing above him or below him, Who'd make a riot, or a poem, From excentricity of thought, Not always do the thing he ought; But was it once his own election, Would bring all matters to perfection; Would act, design, engrave, write, paint, But neither from the least constraint, Who hated all pedantic schools, And scorn'd the gloss of knowing fools, That hold perfection all in all, Yet treat it as mechanical, And give the same sufficient rule To make a poem, as a stool— From the first spring-time of his youth, Was downright worshipper of truth; And with a free and liberal spirit, His courtship paid to lady Merit. Envy, a squint-ey'd, mere old maid, Well known among the scribbling trade; A hag, so very, very thin, Her bones peep'd through her bladder-skin; Who could not for her soul abide That folks shou'd praise, where she must chide, Follow'd the Youth where'er he went, To mar each good and brave intent; Would lies, and plots, and mischief hatch, To ruin him and spoil the match. Honour she held at bold defiance, Talk'd much of Faction, Gang, Alliance, As if the real sons of taste Had clubb'd to lay a Desart waste. In short, wherever Genius came, You'd find this Antiquated Dame; Whate'er he did, where'er he went, She follow'd only to torment; Call'd Merit by a thousand names, Which decency or truth disclaims, While all her business, toil, and care, Was to depreciate, lye, compare, To pull the Modest Maiden down, And blast her fame to all the town. The Youth, inflam'd with conscious pride, To Prince Posterity apply'd, Who gave his answer thus in rhyme, By his chief minister, Old Time. “Repine not at what pedants fay, “We'll bring thee forward on the way; “If wither'd Envy strive to hurt “With lies, with impudence and dirt, “You only pay a common tax “Which fool, and knave, and dunce exacts. “Be this thy comfort, this thy joy, “Thy strength is in its prime, my boy, “And ev'ry year thy vigour grows, “Impairs the credit of my foes. “Envy shall sink, and be no more “Than what her Naiads were before; “Mere excremental maggots, bred “In poet's topsy-turvy head, “Born like a momentary fly, “To flutter, buzz about, and die. “Yet, Genius, mark what I presage, “Who look through every distant age: “Merit shall bless thee with her charms, “Fame lift thy offspring in her arms, “And stamp eternity of grace “On all thy numerous various race. “Roubilliac, Wilton, names as high “As Phidias of antiquity, “Shall strength, expression, manner give, “And make e'en marble breathe and live; “While Sigismunda's deep distress, “Which looks the soul of wretchedness, “When I, with slow and soft'ning pen, “Have gone o'er all the tints agen, “Shall urge a bold and proper claim “To level half the antient fame; “While future ages yet unknown “With critic air shall proudly own “Thy Hogarth first of every clime, “For humour keen, or strong sublime, “And hail him from his fire and spirit, “The child of Genius and of Merit.” THE HARE AND TORTOISE, 1757. A FABLE. Genius, blest term, of meaning wide, For sure no term so misapply'd, How many bear thy sacred name, That never felt a real flame! Proud of the specious appellation, Thus fools have christen'd inclination. But yet suppose a genius true, Exempli gratiâ, me or you: Whate'er he tries with due attention, Rarely escapes his apprehension; Surmounting ev'ry opposition, You'd swear he learnt by intuition. Shou'd he rely alone on parts, And study therefore but by starts? Sure of success whene'er he tries, Should he forego the means to rise? Suppose your watch a Graham make, Gold, if you will, for value's sake; Its springs within in order due, No watch, when going, goes so true; If ne'er wound up with proper care, What service is it in the wear? Some genial spark of Phœbus' rays, Perhaps within your bosom plays: O how the purer rays aspire, If application fans the fire! Without it Genius vainly tries, Howe'er sometimes it seem to rise: Nay application will prevail, When braggart parts and Genius fail: And now to lay my proof before ye, I here present you with a story. In days of yore, when time was young, When birds convers'd as well as sung, When use of speech was not confin'd, Merely to brutes of human kind, A forward Hare, of swiftness vain, The Genius of the neighb'ring plain, Wou'd oft deride the drudging croud: For Geniuses are ever proud. He'd boast, his flight 'twere vain to follow, For dog and horse he'd beat them hollow, Nay, if he put forth all his strength, Outstrip his brethren half a length. A Tortoise heard his vain oration, And vented thus his indignation. Oh Puss, it bodes thee dire disgrace, When I defy thee to the race. Come, 'tis a match, nay, no denial, I lay my shell upon the trial. 'Twas done and gone, all fair, a bet, Judges prepar'd, and distance set. The scamp'ring Hare outstript the wind, The creeping Tortoise lagg'd behind, And scarce had pass'd a single pole, When Puss had almost reach'd the goal. Friend Tortoise, quoth the jeering Hare, Your burthen's more than you can bear, To help your speed, it were as well That I should ease you of your shell: Jog on a little faster pr'ythee, I'll take a nap, and then be with thee. So said, so done, and safely sure, For say, what conquest more secure? Whene'er he wak'd (that's all that's in it) He could o'ertake him in a minute. The tortoise heard his taunting jeer, But still resolv'd to persevere, Still draw'd along, as who should say, I'll win, like Fabius, by delay; On to the goal securely crept, While Puss unknowing soundly slept. The bets were won, the Hare awake, When thus the victor Tortoise spake. Puss, tho' I own thy quicker parts, Things are not always done by starts. You may deride my aukward pace, But slow and steady wins the race. THE SATYR AND PEDLAR, 1757. Words are, so Wollaston defines, Of our ideas merely signs, Which have a pow'r at will to vary, As being vague and arbitrary. Now damn'd for instance—all agree, Damn'd's the superlative degree; Means that alone, and nothing more, However taken heretofore; Damn'd is a word can't stand alone, Which has no meaning of its own, But signifies or bad or good Just as its neighbour's understood. Examples we may find enough, Damn'd high, damn'd low, damn'd fine, damn'd stusf. So fares it too with its relation, I mean its substantive, damnation. The wit with metaphors makes bold, And tells you he's damnation cold; Perhaps, that metaphor forgot, The self-same wit's damnation hot. And here a fable I remember— Once in the middle of December, When ev'ry mead in snow is lost, And ev'ry river bound with frost, When families get all together, And feelingly talk o'er the weather; When—pox on the descriptive rhyme—- In short it was the winter time. It was a Pedlar's happy lot, To fall into a Satyr's cot: Shiv'ring with cold, and almost froze, With pearly drop upon his nose, His fingers' ends all pinch'd to death, He blew upon them with his breath. “Friend, quoth the Satyr, what intends “That blowing on thy fingers ends? “It is to warm them thus I blow, “For they are froze as cold as snow. “And so inclement has it been “I'm like a cake of ice within.” Come, quoth the Satyr, comfort, man! I'll chear thy inside, if I can; You're welcome in my homely cottage To a warm fire, and mess of pottage. This said, the Satyr, nothing loth, A bowl prepar'd of sav'ry broth, Which with delight the Pedlar view'd, As smoking on the board it stood. But, though the very steam arose With grateful odour to his nose, One single sip he ventur'd not, The gruel was so wond'rous hot. What can be done?—-with gentle puff He blows it, 'till it's cool enough. Why how now, Pedlar, what's the matter? Still at thy blowing! quoth the Satyr. I blow to cool it, cries the Clown, That I may get the liquor down: For though I grant, you've made it well, You've boil'd it, sir, as hot as hell. Then raising high his cloven stump, The Satyr smote him on the rump. “Begone, thou double knave, or fool, “With the same breath to warm and cool: “Friendship with such I never hold “Who're so damn'd hot, and so damn'd cold. THE NIGHTINGALE, THE OWL, AND THE CUCKOW. A FABLE. ADDRESSED TO DAVID GARRICK, ESQ. ON THE REPORT OF HIS RETIRING FROM THE STAGE, DEC. 1760. Critics, who like the scarecrows stand Upon the poet's common land, And with severity of sense, Drive all imagination thence, Say that in truth lies all sublime, Whether you write in prose or rhyme. And yet the truth may lose its grace, If blurted to a person's face; Especially if what you speak Shou'd crimson o'er the glowing cheek: For when you throw that slaver o'er him, And tumble out your praise before him, However just the application, It looks a-squint at adulation. I would be honest and sincere, But not a slatterer, or severe. Need I be surly, rough, uncouth, That folks may think I love the truth? And She, good dame, with Beauty's Queen, Was not at all times naked seen: For every boy, with Prior, knows, By accident she lost her cloaths, When Falshood stole them to disguise Her misbegotten brood of lies. Why should the prudish Goddess dwell Down at the bottom of a well, But that she is in pitious fright, Lest, rising up to mortal sight, The modest world shou'd fleer and flout her, With not a rag of cloaths about her? Yet she might wear a proper dress And keep her essence ne'ertheless. So Delia's bosom still will rise, And fascinate her lover's eyes, Tho' round her ivory neck she draws, The decent shade of specious gauze. I hear it buzz'd about the table, What can this lead to?—Sirs, A FABLE. When Birds allow'd the Eagle's sway, Ere Eagles turn'd to fowls of prey, His Royal Majesty of Air Took Music underneath his care; And, for his queen and court's delight, Commanded Concerts ev'ry night. Here every Bird of Parts might enter, The Nightingale was made Præcentor; Under whose care and just direction, Merit was sure to meet protection. The Lark, the Blackbird, and the Robin This concert always bore a bob in: The best performers all were in it, The Thrush, Canary-bird, and Linnet. But Birds, alas! are apt to aim At things, to which they've smallest claim. The staring Owl, with hideous hoot, Offer'd his service for a flute. The Cuckow needs would join the band; “The Thrush is but a paultry hand: “And I can best supply that place, “For I've a shake, a swell, a grace.” The Manager their suit preferr'd: Both tun'd their pipes, and both were heard; Yet each their several praises miss'd, For both were heard, and both were hiss'd. The Cuckow hence, with rancour stirr'd, (A kind of periodic bird, Of nasty hue, and body scabby, No would-be-play-wright half so shabby) Reviles, abuses, and defames, Screams from a branch, and calls hard names, And strikes at Nightingale or Lark, Like Lisbon ruffians, in the dark. The Owl harangues the gaping throng On Pow'rs, and excellence of song, “The Blackbird's note has lost its force; “The Nightingale is downright hoarse; “The Linnet's harsh; the Robin shrill; “—The Sparrow has prodigious skill! At length they had what they desir'd: The skilful Nightingale retir'd. When Folly came, with wild Uproar, And Harmony was heard no more. A TALE. Venus, of laughter queen and love, The greatest demirep above, Who scorn'd restriction, hated custom, Knew her own sex too well to trust 'em, Proceeded on the noble plan, At any rate, to have her man; Look'd on decorum, as mere trash, And liv'd like ? and ? From Paphos, where they her revere As much as we do Cælia here, Or from Cythera, where her altars Are deck'd with daggers, true-love halters, Garters yclept, and other trophies, Which prove that man in love an oaf is, According to appointment, came To see Cæcilia, tuneful dame, Whose praise by Dryden's Ode is grown Bright and immortal as his own, And who hath been for many years The chief directress of the spheres. Thomas, who rode behind the car, And for a flambeau held a star, Who, in the honest way of trade, Hath forg'd more horns, and cuckolds made, Than Vulcan and his brawny dolts Ever for Jove forg'd thunderbolts, Slipt gently down, and ran before 'em, Ringing the bell with due decorum. But, truth to say, I cannot tell Whether it Knocker was or Bell, (This for vertù an anecdote is,) Which us'd to give Cæcilia notice, When any lady of the sky Was come to bear her company. But this I'm sure, be which it will, Thomas perform'd his part with skill. Methinks I hear the reader cry— His part with skill? why, You or I, Or any body else, as well As Thomas, sure, could ring a bell, Nor did I ever hear before Of skill in knocking at a door. Poor low-liv'd creature! I suppose, Nay, and am sure, you're one of those Who, at what door soe'er they be, Will always knock in the same key. Thinking that Bell and Knocker too Were found out nothing else to do, But to inform the house, no doubt, That there was somebody without, Who, if they might such favour win, Would rather chuse to be within. But had our servants no more sense, Lord! what must be the consequence? Error would error still pursue, And strife and anarchy ensue, Punctilio from her altar hurl'd, Whence she declares unto the world Whate'er by fancy is decreed, Thro' all her niceties must bleed. For if there was not to be found Some wholesome difference of sound, But the same rap foretold th' approach Of him who walk'd, or rode in coach, A poor relation now and then, Might to my lord admittance gain, When his good lordship hop'd to see Some rascal of his own degree; And, what is more unhappy still, The stupid wretch who brings a bill, Might pass thro' all the motley tribe, As free as one, who brings a bribe. My lady too might pique her grace With carriage stiff and formal face, Which, she deceiv'd, had taken care For some inferior to prepare; Or might some wretch from Lombard-street With greater ease and freedom meet, Than sense of honour will admit Between my lady and a cit. Those evils wisely to prevent, And root out care and discontent, Ev'ry gay smart, who rides behind, With rose and bag in taste refin'd, Must musick fully understand, Have a nice ear and skilful hand; At ev'ry turn be always found A perfect connoisseur in sound; Thro' all the gamut skilful fly Varying his notes, now low, now high, According as he shifts his place; Now hoarsely grumbling in the base, Now turning tenor, and again To treble raising his shrill strain; So to declare, where'er he be, His master's fortune and degree, By the distinguishing address Which he'll upon the door express. Thomas, whom I have nam'd before As ringing at Cæcilia's door, Was perfect master of this art, And vers'd alike in ev'ry part: So that Cæcilia knew, before Her footman came unto the door, And in due form had told her so, That Madam Venus was below. The doors immediate open flew, The Goddess, without more ado, Displaying beauty's thousand airs, Skim'd thro' the hall, and trip'd up stairs. Cæcilia met her with a smile Of great delight, when all the while If her false heart could have been seen, She wish'd she had at Cyprus been. But ladies, skill'd in forms and arts, Don't in their faces wear their hearts, And those above, like those below, Deal frequently in outside show, And always to keep up parade, Have a smile by them ready-made. The forms, which ladies when they meet Must for good-manners' sake repeat, As bumble servant, how d'you do, And in return, pray how are you? Enrich'd at ev'ry proper space With due integuments of lace, As Madam, Grace, and Goddeship, Which we for brevity shall skip, Happily past, in elbow-chair At length our ladies seated are. Indiff'rent subjects first they chuse, And talk of weather and the news. That done, they sit upon the state, And snarl at the decrees of fate, Invectives against Jove are hurl'd, And They alone should rule the world. Dull politicks at length they quit, And by ill-nature shew their wit; For hand in hand, too well we know, These intimates are said to go, So that where either doth preside T' other's existence is implied. The man of wit, so men decree, Must without doubt ill-natur'd be; And the ill-natur'd scarce forgets To rank himself among the wits. Malicious Venus, who by rote Had ev'ry little anecdote, And most minutely could advance Each interesting circumstance, Which unto all intrigues related, Since Jupiter the world created, Display'd her eloquence with pride, Hinted, observ'd, enlarg'd, applied; And not the reader to detain With things impertinent and vain, She did, as ladies do on earth Who cannot bear a rival's worth, In such a way each tale rehearse As good made bad, and bad made worfe: Cæcilia too, with saint-like air, But lately come from evening pray'r, Who knew her duty, as a saint, Always to pray, and not to faint, And, rain or shine, her church ne'er mist, Prude, devotee, and methodist, With equal zeal the cause promoted, Misconstru'd things, and words misquoted, Misrepresented, misapplied, And, inspiration being her guide, The very heart of man dissected, And to his principles objected. Thus, amongst us, the sanctified, In all the spirituals of pride, Whose honest consciences ne'er rested, Till, of carnalities divested, They knew and felt themselves t'inherit A double portion of the spirit: Who from one church to t'other roam, Whilst their poor children starve at home, Consid'ring they may claim the care Of Providence, who sent them there, And therefore certainly is tied To see their ev'ry want supplied; Who unto preachers give away, That which their creditors should pay, And hold that chosen vessels must Be generous before they're just, And that their charity this way Shall bind o'er heaven their debts to pay, And serve their temp'ral turn, no doubt, Better than if they'd put it out, Whilst nought hereafter can prevent, Their sure reward of cent. per cent. Who honest labour scorn, and say None need to work who love to pray, For heav'n will satisfy their cravings, By sending of Elijah's ravens, Or rain down, when their spirits fail, A dish of manna, or a quail; Who from Moorfields to Tottenham Court In furious fits of zeal resort, Praise what they do not understand, Turn up the eye, stretch out the hand, Melt into tears, whilst?blows The twang of nonsense thro' his nose, Or?deals in speculation, Or?hums his congregation, Or?talks with the lord of hosts, ?with pillars and with posts; Who strictly watch, lest Satan shou'd, Roaring like lion for his food, Ensnare their feet his fatal trap in, And their poor souls be taken napping; Who strictly fast, because they find, The flesh still wars against the mind, And flesh of saints, like sinner's, must Be mortified, to keep down lust; Who, four times in the year at least, Join feast of love to love of feast, Which, tho' the profligate and vain In terms of blasphemy prophane, Yet all the ceremony here is Pure as the mysteries of Ceres; Who, God's elect, with triumph feel Within themselves salvation's seal, And will not, must not, dare not doubt, That heav'n itself can't blot it out; After they've done their holy labours, Return to scandalize their neighbours, And think they can't serve heav'n so well, As with its creatures filling hell: So that, inflam'd with holy pride, They save themselves, damn all beside. For persons, who pretend to feel The glowings of uncommon zeal, Who others scorn, and seem to be Righteous in very great degree, Do, 'bove all others, take delight To vent their spleen in tales of spite, And think they raise their own renown By pulling of a neighbour's down; Still lying on with most success, Because they charity profess, And make the out-side of religion, Like Mahomet's inspiring pigeon, To all their forgeries gain credit, 'Tis enough sure that?said it. But what can all this rambling mean? Was ever such an hodge-podge seen? Venus, CÆcilia, Saints, and Whores, Thomas, Vertù, Bells, Knockers, Doors, Lords, Rogues, Relations, Ladies, Cits, Stars, Flambeaux, Thunderbolts, Horns, Wits, Vulcan, and Cuckold-maker, Scandal, Music, and Footmen, Ear of Handel, Weather, News, Envy, Politicks, Intrigues, and Women's Thousand Tricks, Prudes, Methodists, and Devotees, Fastings, Feasts, Pray'rs, and Charities, Ceres, with her mysterious train, ?,?,?, and?, Flesh, Spirit, Love, Hate, and Religion, A Quail, a Raven, and a Pigeon, All jumbled up in one large dish, Red-Herring, Bread, Fowl, Flesh, and Fish. Where's the connection, where's the plan? The devil sure is in the man. All in an instant we are hurl'd From place to place all round the world, Yet find no reason for it—mum— There, my good critic, lies the hum— Well, but methinks, it wou'd avail To know the end of this—A TALE. SHAKESPEARE: AN EPISTLE TO MR. GARRICK. Thanks to much industry and pains, Much twisting of the wit and brains, Translation has unlock'd the store, And spread abroad the Grecian lore, While Sophocles his scenes are grown E'en as familiar as our own. No more shall taste presume to speak From its enclosures in the Greek; But, all its fences broken down, Lie at the mercy of the town. Critic, I hear thy torrent rage, “'Tis blasphemy against that stage, “Which Æschylus his warmth design'd, “Euripides his taste refin'd, “And Sophocles his last direction, “Stamp'd with the signet of perfection.” Perfection! 'tis a word ideal, That bears about it nothing real: For excellence was never hit In the first essays of man's wit. Shall ancient worth, or ancient fame Preclude the Moderns from their claim? Must they be blockheads, dolts, and fools, Who write not up to Grecian rules? Who tread in buskins or in socks. Must they be damn'd as Heterodox, Nor merit of good works prevail, Except within the classic pale? 'Tis stuff that bears the name of knowledge, Not current half a mile from college; Where half their lectures yield no more (Besure I speak of times of yore) Than just a niggard light, to mark How much we all are in the dark. As rushlights in a spacious room, Just burn enough to form a gloom. When Shakespear leads the mind a dance, From France to England, hence to france, Talk not to me of time and place; I own I'm happy in the chace. Whether the drama's here or there, 'Tis nature, Shakespeare, every where. The poet's fancy can create, Contract, enlarge, annihilate, Bring past and present close together, In spite of distance, seas, or weather; And shut up in a single action, What cost whole years in its transaction. So, ladies at a play, or rout, Can flirt the universe about, Whose geographical account Is drawn and pictured on the mount. Yet, when they please, contract the plan, And shut the world up in a fan. True Genius, like Armida's wand, Can raise the spring from barren land. While all the art of Imitation, Is pilf'ring from the first creation; Transplanting flowers, with useless toil, Which wither in a foreign soil. As conscience often sets us right By its interior active light, Without th' assistance of the laws To combat in the moral cause So Genius, of itself discerning, Without the mystic rules of learning, Can, from its present intuition, Strike at the truth of composition. Yet those who breathe the classic vein, Enlisted in the mimic train, Who ride their steed with double bit, Ne'er run away with by their wit, Delighted with the pomp of rules, The specious pedantry of schools, (Which rules, like crutches, ne'er became Of any use but to the lame) Pursue the method set before 'em; Talk much of order, and decorum, Of probability of fiction, Of manners, ornament, and diction, And with a jargon of hard names, (A privilege which dulness claims, And merely us'd by way of fence, To keep out plain and common fense) Extol the wit of antient days, The simple fabric of their plays; Then from the fable, all so chaste, Trick'd up in ancient-modern taste, So mighty gentle all the while, In such a sweet descriptive stile, While Chorus marks the servile mode With fine reflection, in an ode, Present you with a perfect piece, Form'd on the model of old Greece. Come, pr'ythee Critic, set before us, The use and office of a chorus. What! silent! why then, I'll produce Its services from antient use. 'Tis to be ever on the stage, Attendants upon grief or rage, To be an arrant go-between, Chief-mourner at each dismal scene; Shewing its sorrow, or delight, By shifting dances, left and right, Not much unlike our modern notions, Adagio or Allegro motions; To watch upon the deep distress, And plaints of royal wretchedness; And when, with tears, and execration, They've pour'd out all their lamentation, And wept whole cataracts from their eyes, To call on rivers for supplies, And with their Hais, and Hees, and Hoes, To make a symphony of woes. Doubtless the Antients want the art To strike at once upon the heart: Or why their prologues of a mile In simple—call it—humble stile, In unimpassion'd phrase to say “'Fore the beginning of this play, “I, hapless Polydore, was found “By fishermen, or others drown'd!” Or, “I, a gentleman, did wed, “The lady I wou'd never bed, “Great Agamemnon's royal daughter, “Who's coming hither to draw water.” Or need the Chorus to reveal Reflexions, which the audience feel; And jog them, lest attention sink, To tell them how and what to think? Oh, where's the Bard, who at one view Cou'd look the whole creation through, Who travers'd all the human heart, Without recourse to Grecian art? He scorn'd the modes of imitation, Of altering, pilfering, and translation, Nor painted horror, grief, or rage, From models of a former age; The bright original he took, And tore the leaf from nature's book. 'Tis Shakespeare, thus, who stands alone— —But why repeat what rou have shown? How true, how perfect, and how well, The feelings of our hearts must tell. AN EPISTLE TO C. CHURCHILL, AUTHOR OF THE ROSCIAD. If at a Tavern, where you'd wish to dine, They cheat your palate with adulterate wine, Would you, resolve me, critics, for you can, Send for the master up, or chide the man? The man no doubt a knavish business drives, But tell me what's the master who connives? Hence you'll infer, and sure the doctrine's true, Which says, no quarter to a foul Review. It matters not who vends the nauseous slop, Master or prentice; we detest the shop. Critics of old, a manly liberal race, Approv'd or censur'd with an open face: Boldly pursu'd the free decisive task, Nor stabb'd, conceal'd beneath a ruffian's mask. To works not men, with honest warmth, severe, Th' impartial judges laugh'd at hope or fear: Theirs was the noble skill, with gen'rous aim, To fan true genius to an active flame; To bring forth merit in its strongest light, Or damn the blockhead to his native night. But, as all states are subject to decay, The state of letters too will melt away, Smit with the harlot charms of trilling sound, Softness now wantons e'en on Roman ground; Where Thebans, Spartans, sought their honour'd graves, Behold a weak enervate race of slaves. In classic lore, deep science, language dead, Tho' modern witlings are but scantly read, Professors The author takes this opportunity, notwithstanding all iusinuations to the contrary, to declare, that he has no particular aim at a gentleman, whose abilities he sufficiently acknowledges. fail not, who will loudly bawl In praise of either, with the want of all: Hail'd mighty critics to this present hour. —The tribune's name surviv'd the tribune's pow'r. Now Quack and Critic differ but in name, Empirics frontless both, they mean the same; This raw in Physic, that in Letters fresh, Both spring, like warts, excrescence from the flesh. Half form'd, half bred in printers' hireling schools, For all professions have their rogues and fools, Tho' the pert witling, or the coward knave, Casts no reflection on the wise or brave. Yet, in these leaden times, this idle age, When, blind with dulness, or as blind with rage, Author 'gainst author rails with venom curst, And happy He who calls out blockhead first; From the low earth aspiring genius springs, And sails triumphant, born on eagle wings. No toothless spleen, no venom'd critic's aim, Shall rob thee, Churchill, of thy proper fame; While hitch'd for ever in thy nervous rhyme, Fool lives, and shines out fool to latest time. Pity perhaps might wish a harmless fool To scape th' observance of the critic school; But if low malice, leagu'd with folly, rise, Arm'd with invectives, and hedg'd round with lies; Should wakeful dulness, if she ever wake, Write sleepy nonsense but for writing's sake, And, stung with rage, and piously severe, Wish bitter comforts to your dying ear; If some small wit, some silk-lin'd verseman, rakes For quaint reflections in the putrid jakes, Talents usurp'd demand a censor's rage, A dunce is dunce proscrib'd in ev'ry age. Courtier, physician, lawyer, parson, cit, All, all are objects of theatric wit. Are ye then, Actors, privileg'd alone, To make that weapon, ridicule, your own? Professions bleed not from his just attack, Who laughs at pedant, coxcomb, knave, or quack; Fools on and off the stage are fools the same, And every dunce is satire's lawful game. Freely you thought, where thought has free'st room, Why then apologize? for what? to whom? Though Gray's-Inn wits with author squires unite, And self-made giants club their labour'd mite, Though pointless satire make its weak escape, In the dull babble of a mimic ape, Boldly pursue where genius points the way, Nor heed what monthly puny critics say. Firm in thyself, with calm indifference smile, When the wise Vet'ran knows you by your stile, With critic scales weighs out the partial wit, What I, or You, or He, or no one writ; Denying thee thy just and proper worth, But to give falshood's spurious issue birth; And all self-will'd with lawless hand to raise Malicious slander on the base of praise. Disgrace eternal wait the wretch's name Who lives on credit of a borrow'd fame; Who wears the trappings of another's wit, Or fathers bantlings which he could not get! But shrewd Suspicion with her squinting eye, To truth declar'd, prefers a whisper'd lye. With greedy mind the proffer'd tale believes, Relates her wishes, and with joy deceives. The World, a pompous name, by custom due To the small circle of a talking few, With heart-felt glee th' injurious tale repeats, And sends the whisper buzzing through the streets. The prude demure, with sober saint-like air, Pities her neighbour for she's wond'rous fair. And when temptations lie before our feet, Beauty is frail, and females indiscreet. She hopes the nymph will every danger shun, Yet prays devoutly—that the deed were done. Mean time sits watching for the daily lie, As spiders lurk to catch a simple fly. Yet is not scandal to one sex confin'd, Though men would fix it on the weaker kind. Yet, this great lord, creation's master, man, Will vent his malice where the blockhead can, Imputing crimes, of which e'en thought is free, For instance now, your Rosciad, all to me. If partial friendship, in thy sterling lays, Grows all too wanton in another's praise, Critics, who judge by ways themselves have known, Shall swear the praise, the poem is my own; For 'tis the method in these learned days For wits to scribble first, and after praise. Critics and Co. thus vend their wretched stuff, And help out nonsense by a monthly puff, Exalt to giant's forms weak puny elves, And descant sweetly on their own dear selves; For works per month by learning's midwives paid, Demand a puffing in the way of trade. Reserv'd and cautious, with no partial aim My Muse e'er sought to blast another's fame. With willing hand cou'd twine a rival's bays, From candour silent where she cou'd not praise. But if vile rancour, from (no matter who) Actor, or mimic, printer, or Review, Lies, oft o'erthrown, with ceaseless venom spread Still hiss out scandal from their Hydra head, If the dull malice boldly walk the town, Patience herself wou'd wrinkle to a frown. Come then with justice draw the ready pen, Give me the works, I wou'd not know the men. All in their turns might make reprisals too, Had all the patience but to read them through. Come, to the utmost, probe the desperate wound, Nor spare the knife where'er infection's found! But, Prudence, Churchill, or her sister, Fear, Whispers forbearance to my fright'ned ear. Oh! then with me forsake the thorny road, Lest we should flounder in some Fleet-Ditch Ode, And sunk for ever in the lazy flood Weep with the Naiads heavy drops of Mud. Hail mighty Ode! which like a picture frame, Holds any portrait, and with any name; Or, like your nitches, planted thick and thin, Will serve to cram the random hero in. Hail mighty Bard too—whatsoe'er thy name, ?or Durfy, for it's all the same. To brother bards shall equal praise belong, For wit, for genius, comedy and song? No costive Muse is thine, which freely rakes With ease familiar in the well-known jakes, Happy in skill to souse through foul and fair, And toss the dung out with a lordly air. So have I seen, amidst the grinning throng, The sledge procession slowly dragg'd along, Where the mock female shrew and hen-peck'd male Scoop'd rich contents from either copious pail, Call'd bursts of laughter from the roaring rout, And dash'd and splash'd the filthy grains about. Quit then, my friend, the Muses' lov'd abode, Alas! they lead not to preferment's road. Be solemn, sad, put on the priestly frown, Be dull! 'tis sacred, and becomes the gown. Leave wit to others, do a Christian deed, Your foes shall thank you, for they know their need. Broad is the path by learning's sons possess'd, A thousand modern wits might walk abreast, Did not each poet mourn his luckless doom, Jostled by pedants out of elbow room. I, who nor court their love, nor fear their hate, Must mourn in silence o'er the Muse's fate. No right of common now on Pindus' hill, While all our tenures are by critic's will. Where, watchful guardians of the lady muse, Dwell monstrous giants, dreadful tall Reviews, Who, as we read in fam'd romance of yore, Sound but a horn, press forward to the door. But let some chief, some bold advent'rous knight, Provoke these champions to an equal fight, Strait into air to spaceless nothing fall The castle, lions, giants, dwarf and all. Ill it befits with undiscerning rage, To censure Giants in this polish'd age. No lack of genius stains these happy times, No want of learning, and no dearth of rhymes. The see-saw Muse that flows by measur'd laws, In tunesul numbers, and affected pause, With sound alone, sound's happy virtue fraught, Which hates the trouble and expence of thought, Once, every moon throughout the circling year, With even cadence charms the critic ear. While, dire promoter of poetic sin, A Magazine must hand the lady in. How Moderns write, how nervous, strong and well, The Anti-Rosciad's decent Muse does tell: Who, while she strives to cleanse each actor hurt, Daubs with her praise, and rubs him into dirt. Sure never yet was happy æra known So gay, so wise, so tasteful as our own. Our curious histories rise at once complete, Yet still continued, as they're paid, per sheet. See every science which the world wou'd know, Your Magazines shall every month bestow, Whose very titles fill the mind with awe, Imperial, Christian, Royal, British, Law; Their rich contents will every reader fit, Statesman, Divine, Philosopher, and Wit; Compendious schemes! which teach all things at once, And make a pedant coxcomb of a dunce. But let not anger with such frenzy grow, Drawcansir like, to strike down friend and foe. To real worth be homage duly paid, But no allowance to the paltry trade. My friends I name not (though I boast a few, To me an honour, and to letters too) Fain would I praise, but, when such Things oppose, My praise of course must make them?'s foes. If manly Johnson, with satyric rage, Lash the dull follies of a trifling age, If his strong Muse with genuine strength aspire, Glows not the reader with the poet's fire? HIS the true fire, where creep the witling fry To warm themselves, and light their rushlights by. What Muse like Gray's shall pleasing pensive flow Attemper'd sweetly to the rustic woe? Or who like him shall sweep the Theban lyre, And, as his master, pour forth thoughts of fire? E'en now to guard afflicted learning's cause, To judge by reason's rules, and nature's laws, Boast we true critics in their proper right, While Lowth and Learning, Hurd and Taste unite. Hail sacred names!—Oh guard the Muse's page, Save your lov'd mistress from a ruffian's rage; See how she gasps and struggles hard for life, Her wounds all bleeding from the butcher's knife: Critics, like surgeons, blest with curious art, Should mark each passage to the human heart, But not, unskilful, yet with lordly air, Read surgeon's lectures while they scalp and tear. To names like these I pay the hearty vow, Proud of their worth, and not asham'd to bow. To these inscribe my rude, but honest lays, And feel the pleasures of my conscious praise. Not that I mean to court each letter'd name, And poorly glimmer from reflected fame, But that the Muse, who owns no servile fear, Is proud to pay her willing tribute here. EPISTLE TO J. B. ESQ. 1757. Again I urge my old objection, That modern rules obstruct perfection, And the severity of Taste Has laid the walk of genius waste. Fancy's a flight we deal no more in, Our authors creep instead of soaring, And all the brave imagination Is dwindled into declamation. But still you cry in sober sadness, “There is discretion e'en in madness.” A pithy sentence, which wants credit! Because I find a poet said it: Their verdict makes but small impression, Who are known lyars by profession. Rise what exalted flights it will, True genius will be genius still; And say, that horse wou'd you prefer, Which wants a bridle or a spur? The mettled steed may lose his tricks; The jade grows callous to your kicks. Had Shakespeare crept by modern rules, We'd lost his Witches, Fairies, Fools: Instead of all that wild creation, He'd form'd a regular plantation, A garden trim, and all inclos'd, In nicest symmetry dispos'd, The hedges cut in proper order, Nor e'en a branch beyond the border: Now like a forest he appears, The growth of twice three hundred years; Where many a tree aspiring shrouds Its airy summit in the clouds, While round its root still love to twine The ivy or wild eglantine. “But Shakespeare's all creative fancy “Made others love extravagancy; “While cloud-capt nonsense was their aim, “Like Hurlothrumbo's mad lord Flame.” True—who can stop dull imitators? Those younger brothers of translators, Those insects, which from genius rise, And buzz about, in swarms, like flies? Fashion, that sets the modes of dress, Sheds too her influence o'er the press: As formerly the sons of rhyme Sought Shakespeare's fancy and sublime; By cool correctness now they hope To emulate the praise of Pope. But Pope and Shakespeare both disclaim These low retainers to their fame. What task can dulness e'er affect So easy, as to write correct? Poets, 'tis said, are sure to split By too much or too little wit; So, to avoid th' extremes of either, They miss their mark and follow neither; They so exactly poise the scale That neither measure will prevail, And mediocrity the Muse Did never in her sons excuse. 'Tis true, their tawdry works are grac'd With all the charms of modern taste, And every senseless line is drest In quaint expression's tinsel vest. Say, did you never chance to meet A monsieur-barber in the street, Whose ruffle, as it lank depends, And dangles o'er his singers' ends, His olive-tann'd complexion graces With little dabs of Dresden laces, While for the body Monsieur Puff, Wou'd think e'en dowlas fine enough? So fares it with our men of rhymes, Sweet tinklers of poetic chimes. For lace, and fringe, and tawdry cloaths. Sure never yet were greater beaux; But fairly strip them to the shirt, They're all made up of rags and dirt. And shall these wretches bards commence, Without or spirit, taste, or sense? And when they bring no other treasure, Shall I admire them for their measure? Or do I scorn the critic's rules Because I will not learn of fools? Although Longinus' full-mouth'd prose With all the force of genius glows; Though Dionysius' learned taste Is ever manly, just, and chaste, Who, like a skilful wise physician, Dissects each part of composition, And shews how beauty strikes the soul From a just compact of the whole; Though judgment, in Quintillian's page, Holds forth her lamp for ev'ry age; Yet Hypercritics I disdain, A race of blockheads dull and vain, And laugh at all those empty fools, Who cramp a genius with dull rules, And what their narrow science mocks Damn with the name of Het'rodox. These butchers of a poet's fame, While they usurp the critic's name, Cry—“This is taste—that's my opinion.” And poets dread their mock dominion. So have you seen with dire affright, The petty monarch of the night, Seated aloft in elbow chair, Command the prisoners to appear, Harangue an hour on watchmen's praise, And on the dire effect of frays; Then cry, “You'll suffer for your daring, “And d?n you, you shall pay for swearing.” Then turning, tell th' astonish'd ring, I sit to represent the king. EPISTLE TO THE SAME, 1757. Has my good dame a wicked child? It takes the gentler name of wild. If chests he breaks, if locks he picks, 'Tis nothing more than youthful tricks. The mother's fondness stamps it merit, For vices are a sign of spirit. Say, do the neighbours think the same With the good old indulgent dame? Cries gossip Prate, “I hear with grief “My neighbour's son's an arrant thief. “Nay, cou'd you think it, I am told, “He stole five guineas, all in gold. “You know the youth was always wild— “He got his father's maid with child; “And robb'd his master, to defray “The money he had lost at play. “All means to save him now must fail. “What can it end in?—In a jail.” Howe'er the dame doats o'er her youth, My gossip says the very truth. But as his vices love wou'd hide, Or torture them to virtue's side, So friendship's glass deceives the eye, (A glass too apt to magnify) And makes you think at least you see Some spark of genius, ev'n in me: You say I shou'd get fame. I doubt it: Perhaps I am as well without it. For what's the worth of empty praise? What poet ever din'd on bays? For though the Laurel, rarest wonder! May screen us from the stroke of thunder, This mind I ever was, and am in, It is no antidote to famine. And poets live on slender fare, Who, like Cameleons, feed on air, And starve, to gain an empty breath, Which only serves them after death. Grant I succeed, like Horace rise, And strike my head against the skies; Common experience daily shews, That poets have a world of foes; And we shall find in every town Gossips enough to cry them down; Who meet in pious conversation T' anatomize a reputation, With flippant tongue, and empty head, Who talk of things they never read. Their idle censures I despise: Their niggard praises won't suffice. Tempt me no more then to the crime Of dabbling in the font of rhime. My Muse has answer'd all her end, If her productions please a friend. The world is burthen'd with a store, Why need I add one scribbler more? TO ? ABOUT TO PUBLISH A VOLUME OF MISCELLANIES. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1755. Since now, all scruples cast away, Your works are rising into day, Forgive, though I presume to send This honest counsel of a friend. Let not your verse, as verse now goes, Be a strange kind of measur'd prose; Nor let your prose, which sure is worse, Want nought but measure to be verse. Write from your own imagination, Nor curb your Muse by Imitation: For copies shew, howe'er exprest, A barren genius at the best. —But Imitation's all the mode— Yet where one hits, ten miss the road. The mimic bard with pleasure sees Mat. Prior's unaffected ease: Assumes his style, affects a story, Sets every circumstance before ye, The day, the hour, the name, the dwelling, And mars a curious tale in telling: Observes how easy Prior flows, Then runs his numbers down to prose. Others have sought the filthy stews To sind a dirty slip-shod Muse. Their groping genius, while it rakes The bogs, the common-sew'rs, and jakes, Ordure and filth in rhyme exposes, Disgustful to our eyes and noses; With many a dash—that must offend us, And much Hiatus non deflendus. O Swift! how wouldst thou blush to see, Such are the bards who copy Thee? This Milton for his plan will chuse: Wherein resembling Milton's Muse? Milton, like thunder, rolls along In all the majesty of song; While his low mimics meanly creep, Not quite awake, nor quite asleep: Some few, my friend, have sweetly trod In Imitation's dang'rous road. Long as Tobacco's mild perfume Shall scent each happy curate's room, Oft as in elbow-chair he smokes, And quaffs his ale, and cracks his jokes, So long, O Isaac Hawkins Brown, Esq. author of a piece call'd the Pipe of Tobacco, a most excellent imitation of six different authors. Brown, shall last thy praise, Crown'd with Tobacco-leaf for bays; And whosoe'er thy verse shall see, Shall fill another Pipe to thee. TO GEORGE COLMAN, ESQ. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE. WRITTEN JANUARY, i, 1761. FROM TISSINGTON IN DERBYSHIRE. Friendship with most is dead and cool, A dull, inactive, stagnant pool; Yours like the lively current flows, And shares the pleasure it bestows. If there is ought, whose lenient pow'r Can sooth affliction's painful hour, Sweeten the bitter cup of care, And snatch the wretched from despair, Superior to the sense of woes, From friendship's source the balsam flows. Rich then am I, possest of thine, Who know that happy balsam mine. In youth, from nature's genuine heat, The souls congenial spring to meet, And emulation's infant strife, Cements the man in future life. Oft too the mind well-pleas'd surveys Its progress from its childish days; Sees how the current upwards ran, And reads the child o'er in the man. For men, in reason's sober eyes, Are children, but of larger size, Have still their idle hopes and fears, And Hobby-Horse of riper years. Whether a blessing, or a curse, My rattle is the love of verse. Some fancied parts, and emulation, Which still aspires to reputation, Bad infant fancy plume her flight, And held the laurel full to sight. For vanity, the poet's sin, Had ta'en possession all within: And he whose brain is verse-possest, Is in himself as highly blest, As he, whose lines and circles vie With heav'n's direction of the sky. Howe'er the river rolls its tides, The cork upon the surface rides. And on Ink's Ocean, lightly buoy'd, That cork of vanity is Lloyd. Let me too use the common claim And souse at once upon my name, Which some have done with greater stress, Who know me, and who love me less. Poets are very harmless things, Unless you teaze one till he stings; And when asfronts are plainly meant, We're bound in honour to resent: And what tribunal will deny An injur'd person to reply? In these familiar emanations, Which are but writing conversations, Where thought appears in dishabille, And fancy does just what she will, The sourest critic wou'd excuse The vagrant sallies of the Muse: Which lady, for Apollo's blessing, Has still attended our caressing, As many children round her sees As maggots in a Cheshire cheese, Which I maintain at vast expence, Of pen and paper, time and sense: And surely 'twas no small miscarriage When first I enter'd into marriage. The poet's title which I bear, With some strange castles in the air, Was all my portion with the fair. However narrowly I look, In Phœbus's valorem book, I cannot from enquiry find Poets had much to leave behind. They had a copyhold estate In lands which they themselves create, A foolish title to a fountain, A right of common in a mountain, And yet they liv'd amongst the great, More than their brethren do of late; Invited out at feasts to dine, Eat as they pleas'd, and drank their wine; Nor is it any where set down They tipt the servants half a crown, But pass'd amid the waiting throng And pay'd the porter with a song; As once, a wag, in modern days, When all are in these bribing ways, His shillings to dispense unable, Scrap'd half the fruit from off the table, And walking gravely thro' the croud, Which stood obsequiously, and bow'd, To keep the fashion up of tipping, Dropt in each hand a golden pippin. But there's a difference indeed 'Twixt ancient bards and modern breed. Tho' poet known, in Roman days, Fearless he walk'd the public ways, Nor ever knew that sacred name Contemptuous smile, or painful shame: While with a foolish face of praise, The solks wou'd stop to gape and gaze, And half untold the story leave, Pulling their neighbour by the sleeve, While th' index of the finger shews, —There—yonder's Horace—there he goes. This finger, I allow it true, Points at us modern poets too; But 'tis by way of wit and joke, To laugh, or as the phrase is, smoke. Yet there are those, who're fond of wit, Altho' they never us'd it yet, Who wits and witlings entertain; Of Taste, Virtù, and Judgment vain, And dinner, grace, and grace-cup done, Expect a wond'rous deal of fun: “Yes—He at bottom—don't you know him “That's He that wrote the last new poem. “His Humour's exquisitely high, “You'll hear him open by and by.” The man in print and conversation Have often very small relation; And he, whose humour hits the town, When copied fairly, and set down, In public company may pass, For little better than an ass. Perhaps the fault is on his side, Springs it from modesty, or pride, Those qualities asham'd to own, For which he's happy to be known; Or that his nature's strange and shy, And diffident, he knows not why; Or from a prudent kind of fear, As knowing that the world's severe, He wou'd not suffer to escape Familiar wit in easy shape: Lest gaping fools, and vile repeaters, Should catch her up, and spoil her features, And, for the child's unlucky maim, The faultless parent come to shame. Well, but methinks I hear you say, “Write then, my friend!”—Write what?—“a Play. “The theatres are open yet, “The market for all sterling wit; “Try the strong efforts of your pen, “And draw the characters of men; “Or bid the bursting tear to flow, “Obedient to the fabled woe: “With Tragedy's severest art, “Anatomize the human heart, “And, that you may be understood, “Bid nature speak, as nature shou'd.” That talent, George, tho' yet untried, Perhaps my genius has denied; While you, my friend, are sure to please With all the pow'rs of comic ease. Authors, like maids at fifteen years, Are full of wishes, full of fears. One might by pleasant thoughts be led, To lose a trifling maiden-head; But 'tis a terrible vexation To give up with it reputation. And he, who has with Plays to do, Has got the devil to go through. Critics have reason for their rules, I dread the censure of your fools. For tell me, and consult your pride, (Set Garrick for a while aside) How cou'd you, George, with patience bear, The critic prosing in the play'r? Some of that calling have I known, Who hold no judgment like their own; And yet their reasons fairly scan, And separate the wheat and bran; You'd be amaz'd indeed to find, What little wheat is left behind. For, after all their mighty rout, Of chatt'ring round and round about; 'Tis but a kind of clock-work talking, Like crossing on the stage, and walking. The form of this tribunal past, The play receiv'd, the parts all cast, Each actor has his own objections, Each character, new imperfections: The man's is drawn too course and rough, The lady's has not smut enough. It want's a touch of Cibber's ease, A higher kind of talk to please; Such as your titled folks would chuse, And Lords and Ladyships might use, Which stile, whoever would succeed in, Must have small wit, and much good breeding. If this is dialogue—ma foi, Sweet Sir, say I, pardonnez moi! As long as life and business last, The actors have their several cast, A walk where each his talents shews, Queens, Nurses, Tyrants, Lovers, Beaux; Suppose you've found a girl of merit, Who'd shew your part in all its spirit, Take the whole meaning in the scope, Some little lively thing, like Pope, You rob some others of a feather, They've worn for thirty years together. But grant the cast is as you like, To actors which you think will strike. To-morrow then—(but as you know I've ne'er a Comedy to shew, Let me a while in conversation, Make free with yours for application) The arrow's flight can't be prevented— To-morrow then, will be presented The Jealous Wife! To-morrow? Right. How do you sleep, my friend, to-night? Have you no pit-pat hopes and fears, Roast-beef, and catcalls in your ears? Mabb's wheels a-cross your temples creep, You toss and tumble in your sleep, And cry aloud, with rage and spleen, “That fellow murders all my scene.” To-morrow comes. I know your merit, And see the piece's fire and spirit; Yet friendship's zeal is ever hearty, And dreads the efforts of a party. The coach below, the clock gone five, Now to the theatre we drive: Peeping the curtain's eyelet through, Behold the house in dreadful view! Observe how close the critics sit, And not one bonnet in the pit. With horror hear the galleries ring, Nosy! Black Joke! God save the King! Sticks clatter, catcalls scream, Encore! Cocks crow, pit hisses, galleries roar: E'en cha' some oranges is found This night to have a dreadful sound: 'Till, decent sables on his back, (Your prologuizers all wear black) The prologue comes; and, if its mine, Its very good, and very fine. If not, I take a pinch of snuff, And wonder where you got such stuff. That done, a-gape the critics sit, Expectant of the comic wit. The fiddlers play again pell-mell, —But hist!—the prompter rings his bell. —Down there! hats off!—the curtain draws! What follows is—the just applause. TWO ODES I take the liberty of inserting the two following Odes, though I cannot, with strict propriety, print them as my own composition. The truth is, they were written in concert with a friend, to whose labours I am always happy to add my own: I mean the Author of the Jealous Wife. ??????? ??????????? ?? ?? ?? ???, ???????? ???????. Pindar, Olymp. II. ODE I. I. 1. Daughter of Chaos and old Night, Cimmerian Muse, all hail! That wrapt in never-twinkling gloom canst write, And shadowest meaning with thy dusky veil! What Poet sings, and strikes the strings? It was the mighty Theban spoke. He from the ever-living Lyre With magic hand elicits fire. Heard ye the din of Modern Rhimers bray? It was cool M—n: or warm G—y, Involv'd in tenfold smoke. 2. The shallow Fop in antic vest, Tir'd of the beaten road, Proud to be singularly drest, Changes, with every changing moon, the mode. Say, shall not then the heav'n-born Muses too Variety pursue? Shall not applauding critics hail the vogue? Whether the Muse the stile of Cambria's sons, Or the rude gabble of the Huns, Or the broader dialect Of Caledonia she affect, Or take, Hibernia, thy still ranker brogue? 3. On this terrestial ball The tyrant, Fashion, governs all. She, fickle Goddess, whom, in days of yore, The Ideot Moria, on the banks of Seine, Unto an antic fool, hight Andrew, bore. Long she paid him with disdain, And long his pangs in silence he conceal'd: At length, in happy hour, his love-sick pain On thy blest Calends, April, he reveal'd. From their embraces sprung, Ever changing, ever ranging, Fashion, Goddess ever young. II. 1. Perch'd on the dubious height, She loves to ride, Upon a weather-cock, astride. Each blast that blows, around she goes, While nodding o'er her crest, Emblem of her magic pow'r, The light Cameleon stands confest, Changing it's hues a thousand times an hour. And in a vest is she array'd, Of many a dancing moon-beam made, Nor zoneless is her waist: But fair and beautiful, I ween, As the cestos-cinctur'd Queen, Is with the Rainbow's shadowy girdle brac'd. 2. She bids pursue the fav' rite road Of lofty cloud-capt Ode. Meantime each Bard, with eager speed, Vaults on the Pegasean Steed: Yet not that Pegasus, of yore Which th' illustrious Pindar bore, But one of nobler breed. High blood and youth his lusty veins inspire. From Tottipontimoy He came, Who knows not, Tottipontimoy, thy name? The bloody-shoulder'd Arab was his Sire. The Author is either mistaken in this place, or has else indulged himself in a very unwarrantable poetical licence. Whitenose was not the Sire, but a Son of the Godolphin Arabian. See my Calendar. Heber. His White-nose. He on fam'd Doncastria's plains Resign'd his fated breath: In vain for life the struggling courser strains. Ah! who can run the race with death? The tyrant's speed, or man or steed, Strives all in vain to fly. He leads the chace, he wins the race, We stumble, fall, and die. 3. Third from Whitenose springs Pegasus with eagle wings: Light o'er the plain, as dancing cork, With many a bound he beats the ground, While all the Turf with acclamation rings. He won Northampton, Lincoln, Oxford, York: He too Newmarket won. There Granta's Son Seiz'd on the Steed; And thence him led, (fo fate decreed) To where old Cam, renown'd in poet's song, With his dark and inky waves, Either bank in silence laves, Winding slow his sluggish streams along. III. 1. What stripling neat, of visage sweet, In trimmest guise array'd, First the neighing Steed assay'd? His hand a taper switch adorns, his heel Sparkles refulgent with elastick steel: The whiles he wins his whiffling way, Prancing, ambling, round and round, By hill, and dale, and mead, and greenswerd gay: Till sated with the pleasing ride, From the lofty Steed dismounting, He lies along, enwrapt in conscious pride, By gurgling rill, or crystal fountain. 2. Lo! next, a Bard, secure of praise, His self-complacent countenance displays. His broad Mustachios, ting'd with golden die, Flame, like a meteor, to the troubled air: Proud his demeanor, and his eagle eye, O'er-hung with lavish lid, yet shone with glorious glare. The grizzle grace Of bushy peruke shadow'd o'er his face. In large wide boots, whose ponderous weight Would sink each wight of modern date, He rides, well pleas'd. So large a pair Not Garagantua's self might wear: Not He, of nature fierce and cruel, Who, if we trust to antient Ballad, Devour'd Three Pilgrims in a Sallad; Nor He of fame germane, hight Pantagruel. 3. Accoutred thus, th' adventrous Youth Seeks not the level lawn, or velvet mead, Fast by whose side clear streams meandring creep; But urges on amain the fiery Steed Up Snowdon's shaggy side, or Cam brian rock uncouth: Where the venerable herd Of Goats, with long and sapient beard, And wanton Kidlings their blithe revels keep. Now up the mountain see him strain! Now down the vale he's tost, Now flashes on the sight again, Now in the Palpable Obscure quite lost. IV. 1. Man's feeble race eternal dangers wait, With high or low, all, all, is woe, Disease, mischance, pale fear, and dubious fate. But, o'er every peril bounding, Ambition views not all the hills surrounding, And, tiptoe on the mountain's steep, Reflects not on the yawning deep. 2. See, see, he soars! With mighty wings outspread, And long resounding mane, The Courser quits the plain. Aloft in air, see, see him bear The Bard, who shrouds His Lyrick Glory in the clouds, Too fond to strike the stars with lofty head! He topples headlong from the giddy height, Deep in the Cambrian Gulph immerg'd in endless night. 3. O Steed Divine! what daring spirit Rides thee now? tho' he inherit Nor the pride, nor self-opinion, Which elate the mighty Pair, Each of Taste the fav'rite minion, Prancing thro' the desert air; By help mechanick of Equestrian Block, Yet shall he mount, with classick housings grac'd, And, all unheedful of the Critick Mock, Drive his light Courser o'er the bounds of Taste. ODE TO OBLIVION. I. According to Lillæus, who bestows the Parental Function on Oblivion. Verba Obliviscendi regunt Genitivum. Lib. xiii. Cap. 8. There is a similar passage in Busbæus. Parent of Ease! Oblivion old, Who lov'st thy dwelling-place to hold, Where scepter'd Pluto keeps his dreary sway, Whose sullen pride the shiv'ring ghosts obey! Thou, who delightest still to dwell By some hoar and moss-grown cell, At whose dank foot Cocytus joys to roll, Or Styx' black streams, which even Jove controul! Or if it suit thy better will To chuse the tinkling weeping rill, Hard by whose side the seeded poppy red Heaves high in air his sweetly curling head, While, creeping in meanders slow, Lethe's drowsy waters flow, And hollow blasts, which never cease to sigh, Hum to each care-struck mind their lulla-lulla-by! A prey no longer let me be To that gossip Memory, Who waves her banners trim, and proudly flies To spread abroad her bribble-brabble lies. With Thee, Oblivion, let me go, For Memory's a friend to woe; With thee, Forgetfulness, fair silent Queen, The solemn stole of grief is never seen. II. All, all is thine. Thy pow'rful sway The throng'd poetic hosts obey. Tho' in the van of Mem'ry proud t'appear, At thy command they darken in the rear. What tho' the modern Tragic strain For nine whole days protract thy reign, Yet thro' the Nine, like whelps of currish kind, Scarcely it lives, weak, impotent, and blind. Sacred to thee the Crambo Rhime, The motley forms of Pantomime: For Thee from Eunuch's throat still loves to flow The soothing sadness of his warbled woe: Each day to Thee falls Pamphlet clean: Each month a new-born Magazine: Hear then, O Goddess, hear thy vot'ry's pray'r! And, if Thou deign'st to take one moment's care, Attend Thy Bard! who duly pays The tribute of his votive lays; Whose Muse still offers at thy sacred shrine;— Thy Bard, who calls Thee His, and makes him Thine. O, sweet Forgetfulness, supreme Rule supine o'er ev'ry theme, O'er each sad subject, o'er each soothing strain, Of mine, O Goddess, stretch thine awful reign! Nor let Mem'ry steal one note, Which this rude hand to Thee hath wrote! So shalt thou save me from the Poet's shame, Tho' on the letter'd Rubric Dodsley post my Name. III. O come! with opiate poppies crown'd, Shedding slumbers soft around! O come! fat Goddess, drunk with Laureat's Sack!— See, where she sits on the benumb'd Torpedo's back! Me, in thy dull Elysium lapt, O bless With thy calm Forgetfulness! And gently lull my senses all the while With placid poems in the sinking stile! Whether the Herring-Poet sing, Great Laureat of the Fishes' King, Or Lycophron prophetic rave his fill, Wrapt in the darker strains of Johnny—; Or, if He sing, whose verse affords A bevy of the choicest words, Who meets his Lady Muse by moss-grown cell, Adorn'd with epithet and tinkling bell: These, Goddess, let me still forget, With all the dearth of Modern Wit! So may'st Thou gently o'er my youthful breast, Spread, with thy welcome hand, Oblivion's friendly vest. THE PROGRESS OF ENVY. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1751. I Ah me! unhappy state of mortal wight, Sith Envy's sure attendant upon fame, Ne doth she rest from rancorous despight, Until she works him mickle woe and shame; Unhappy he whom Envy thus doth spoil, Ne doth she check her ever restless hate, Until she doth his reputation foil: Ah! luckless imp is he, whose worth elate, Forces him pay this heavy tax for being great. II There stood an ancient mount, yclept Parnass, (The fair domain of sacred poesy) Which, with fresh odours ever-blooming, was Besprinkled with the dew of Castaly; Which now in soothing murmurs whisp'ring glides, Wat'ring with genial waves the fragrant soil, Now rolls adown the mountain's steepy sides, Teaching the vales full beauteously to smile, Dame Nature's handy-work, not form'd by lab'ring toil. III The Muses fair, these peaceful shades among, With skilful fingers sweep the trembling strings; The air in silence listens to the song, And Time forgets to ply his lazy wings; Pale-visag'd Care, with foul unhallow'd feet, Attempts the summit of the hill to gain, Ne can the hag arrive the blisssul seat; Her unavailing strength is spent in vain, Content sits on the top, and mocks her empty pain. IV Oft Phoebus self left his divine abode, And here enshrouded in a shady bow'r, Regardless of his state, lay'd by the God, And own'd sweet Music's more alluring pow'r. On either side was plac'd a peerless wight, Whose merit long had fill'd the trump of Fame; This, Fancy's darling child, was Spenser hight, Who pip'd full pleasing on the banks of Tame; That no less fam'd than He, and Mllton was his name. V In these cool bow'rs they live supinely calm; Now harmless talk, now emulously sing; While Virtue, pouring round her sacred balm, Makes happiness eternal as the spring. Alternately they sung; now Spenser 'gan, Of jousts and tournaments, and champions strong; Now Milton sung of disobedient man, And Eden lost: The bards around them throng, Drawn by the wond'rous magic of their princes' song. VI Not far from these, Dan Chaucer, antient wight, A lofty seat on Mount Parnassus held, Who long had been the Muses' chief delight; His reverend locks were silver'd o'er with eld; Grave was his visage, and his habit plain; And while he sung, fair nature he display'd, In verse albeit uncouth, and simple strain; Ne mote he well be seen, so thick the shade, Which elms and aged oaks had all around him made. VII Next Shakespeare fat, irregularly great, And in his hand a magic rod did hold, Which visionary beings did create, And turn the foulest dross to purest gold: Whatever spirits rove in earth or air, Or bad or good, obey his dread command; To his behests these willingly repair, Those aw'd by terrors of his magic wand, The which not all their pow'rs united might withstand. VIII Beside the bard there stood a beauteous maid, Whose glittering appearance dimm'd the eyen; Her thin-wrought vesture various tints display'd, Fancy her name, ysprong of race divine; Her mantle Wimpled. A word used by Spenser for bung down. The line inclosed within Commas is one of Fairfax's in his translation of Tasso. wimpled low, her silken hair, Which loose adown ner well-turn'd shoulders stray'd, ‘She made a net to catch the wanton air,’ Whose love-sick breezes all around her play'd And seem'd in whispers soft to court the heav'nly maid. IX And ever and anon she wav'd in air A sceptre, fraught with all-creative pow'r: She wav'd it round: Estsoons there did appear Spirits and witches, forms unknown before: Again she lifts her wonder-working wand; Eftsoons upon the flow'ry plain were seen The gay inhabitants of fairie land, And blithe attendants upon Mab their queen In mystic circles danc'd along th' inchanted green. X On th' other side stood Nature, goddess fair; A matron seem'd she, and of manners staid; Beauteous her form, majestic was her air, In loose attire of purest white array'd: A potent rod she bore, whose pow'r was such, (As from her darling's works may well be shown) That often with its soul-enchanting touch, She rais'd or joy, or caus'd the deep-felt groan, And each man's passions made subservient to her own. XI But lo! thick fogs from out the earth arise, And murky mists the buxom air invade, Which with contagion dire infect the skies, And all around their baleful influence shed; Th' infected sky, which whilom was so fair, With thick Cimmerian darkness is o'erspread; The sun, which whilom shone without compare, Muffles in pitchy veil his radiant head, And fore the time sore-grieving seeks his wat'ry bed. XII Envy, the daughter of fell Acheron, (The flood of deadly hate and gloomy night) Had left precipitate her Stygian throne, And thro' the frighted heavens wing'd her flight: With careful eye each realm she did explore, Ne mote she ought of happiness observe; For happiness, alas! was now no more, Sith ev'ry one from virtue's paths did swerve, And trample on religion base designs to serve. XIII At length, on blest Parnassus seated high, Their temple circled with a laurel crown, Spenser and Milton met her scowling eye, And turn'd her horrid grin into a frown. Full fast unto her sister did she post, There to unload the venom of her breast, To tell how all her happiness was crost, Sith others were of happiness possest: Did never gloomy hell send forth like ugly pest. XIV Within the covert of a gloomy wood, Where fun'ral cypress star-proof branches spread, O'ergrown with tangling briers a cavern stood; Fit place for melancholy Dreary-bead. Gloominess. dreary-head. Here a deformed monster joy'd to won, Which on fell rancour ever was ybent, All from the rising to the setting sun, Her heart pursued spite with black intent, Ne could her iron mind at human woes relent. XV In flowing sable stole she was yelad, Which with her countenance did well accord; Forth from her mouth, like one thro' grief gonemad, A frothy sea of nauseous foam was pour'd; A ghastly grin and eyes asquint, display The rancour which her hellish thoughts contain, And how, when man is blest, she pines away, Burning to turn his happiness to pain; Malice the monster's name, a foe to God and man. XVI Along the floor black loathsome toads still crawl, Their gullets swell'd with poison's mortal bane, Which ever and anon they spit at all Whom hapless fortune leads too near her den; Around her waist, in place of silken zone, A life-devouring viper rear'd his head, Who no distinction made 'twixt friend and foen, But death on ev'ry side fierce brandished, Fly, reckless mortals, fly, in vain is Hardy-bcad. Courage. hardy-head. XVII Impatient Envy, thro' th' ætherial waste, With inward venom fraught, and deadly spite, Unto this cavern steer'd her panting haste, Enshrouded in a darksome veil of night. Her inmost heart burnt with impetuous ire, And fell destruction sparkled in her look, Her ferret eyes flash'd with revengeful fire, A while contending passions utt'rance choke, At length the fiend in furious tone her silence broke. XVIII Sister, arise! see how our pow'r decays, No more our empire Thou and I can boast, Sith mortal man now gains immortal praise, Sith man is blest, and Thou and I are lost: See in what state Parnassus' Hill appears; See Phoebus' self two happy bards atween; See how the God their song attentive hears; This Spenser hight, that Milton, well I ween! Whocan behold unmov'd sike heart-tormenting scene? XIX Sister, arise! le let our courage droop, Perforce we will compel these mortals own, That mortal force unto our force shall stoop; Envy and Malice then shall reign alone: Thou best has known to file thy tongue with lies, And to deceive mankind with specious bait: Like Truth accoutred, spreadest forgeries, The fountain of contention and of hate: Arise, unite with me, and be as whilom great! XX The Fiend obey'd, and with impatient voice— “Tremble, ye bards, within that blissful seat; “Malice and Envy shall o'erthrow your joys, “Nor Phoebus self shall our designs defeat. “Shall We, who under friendship's feigned veil, “Prompted the bold archangel to rebel; “Shall We, who under show of sacred zeal, “Plung'd half the pow'rs of heav'n in lowest hell— “Such vile disgrace of us no mortal man shall tell. XXI And now, more hideous render'd to the sight, By reason of her raging cruelty, She burnt to go, equipt in dreadful plight, And find fit engine for her forgery. Her eyes inflam'd did cast their rays askance, While hellish imps prepare the monster's car, In which she might cut thro' the wide expanse, And find out nations that extended far, When all was pitchy dark, ne twinkled one bright star. XXII Black was her chariot, drawn by dragons dire, And each fell serpent had a double tongue, Which ever and anon spit flaming fire, The regions of the tainted air among; A lofty seat the sister-monsters bore, In deadly machinations close combin'd, Dull Folly drove with terrible uproar, And cruel Discord follow'd fast behind; God help the man 'gainst whom such caitiff foes are join'd. XXIII Aloft in air the rattling chariot flies, While thunder harshly grates upon its wheels; Black pointed spires of smoke around them rise, The air depress'd unusual burthen feels; Detested sight! in terrible array, They spur their fiery dragons on amain, Ne mote their anger suffer cold delay, Until the wish'd-for region they obtain, And land their dingy car on Caledonian plain. XXIV Here, eldest son of Malice, long had dwelt A wretch of all the joys of life forlorn; His fame on double falsities was built: (Ah! worthless son, of worthless parent born!) Under the shew of semblance fair, he veil'd The black intentions of his hellish breast; And by these guileful means he more prevail'd Than had he open enmity profest; The wolf more safely wounds when in sheep's cloathing drest. XXV Him then themselves atween they joyful place, (Sure sign of woe when such are pleas'd, alas!) Then measure back the air with swifter pace, Until they reach the foot of Mount Parnass. Hither in evil hour the monsters came, And with their new companion did alight, Who long had lost all sense of virtuous shame, Beholding worth with poisonous despight; On his success depends their impious delight. XXVI Long burnt He sore the summit to obtain, And spread his venom o'er the blissful seat; Long burnt He sore, but still He burnt in vain; Motenone come there, who come with impious feet. At lenth, at unawares, he out doth spit That spite which else had to himself been bane; The venom on the breast of Milton lit, And spread benumbing death thro' every vein; The Bard of life bereft fell senseless on the plain. XXVII As at the banquet of Thyestes old, The sun is said t' have shut his radiant eye, So did he now thro' grief his beams with-hold, And darkness to be felt o'erwhelm'd the sky; Forth issued from their dismal dark abodes The birds attendant upon hideous night, Shriek-owls and ravens, whose fell croaking bodes Approaching death to miserable wight: Did never mind of man behold sike dreadful sight? XXVIII Apollo wails his darling, done to die By foul attempt of Envy's fatal bane; The Muses fprinkle him with dew of Castaly, And crown his death with many a living strain; Hoary Parnassus beats his aged breast, Aged, yet ne'er before did sorrow know; The flowers drooping their despair attest, Th' aggrieved rivers querulously flow; All nature sudden groan'd with sympathetic woe. XXIX But, lo! the sky a gayer livery wears, The melting clouds begin to fade apace, And now the cloak of darkness disappears, (May darkness ever thus to light give place!) Erst griev'd Apollo jocund looks resumes, The Nine renew their whilom chearful song, No grief Parnassus' aged breast consumes, Forth from the teeming earth new flowers sprong, The plenteous rivers flow'd full peacefully along. XXX The stricken Bard fresh vital heat renews, Whose blood, erst stagnate, rushes thro' his veins; Life thro' each pore her spirit doth infuse, And Fame by Malice unextinguish'd reigns: And see, a form breaks forth, all heav'nly bright, Upheld by one of mortal progeny, A Female Form, yclad in snowy white, Ne half so fair at distance seen as nigh; Douglas and Truth appear, Envy and Lauder die. PROLOGUE TO THE JEALOUS WIFE. SPOKEN BY MR. GARRICK. The Jealous Wife! a Comedy! poor man! A charming subject! but a wretched plan. His skittish wit, o'erleaping the due bound, Commits flat trespass upon tragic ground. Quarrels, upbraidings, jealousies, and spleen, Grow too familiar in the comic scene. Tinge but the language with heroic chime, 'Tis Passion, Pathos, Character, Sublime! What round big words had swell'd the pompous scene, A king the husband, and the wife a queen! Then might Distraction rend her graceful hair, See sightless forms, and scream, and gape, and stare. Draw can sir death had rag'd without controul, Here the drawn dagger, there the poison'd bowl. What eyes had stream'd at all the whining woe! What hands had thunder'd at each Hah! and Oh! But peace! the gentle prologue custom sends, Like drum and serjeant, to beat up for friends. At vice and folly, each a lawful game, Our author flies, but with no partial aim. He read the manners, open as they lie In nature's volume to the general eye. Books too he read, nor blush'd to use their store.— He does but what his betters did before. Shake speare has done it, and the Grecian stage Caught truth of character from Homer's page. If in his scenes an honest skill is shewn, And borrowing, little, much appears his own; If what a master's happy pencil drew He brings more forward, in dramatic view; To your decision he submits his cause, Secure of candour, anxious for applause. But if, all rude, his artless scenes deface The simple beauties which he meant to grace; If, an invader upon others' land, He spoil and plunder with a robber's hand, Do justice on him!—As on fools before, And give to Blockheads past one Blockbead more. PROLOGUE, INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN AT DRURY LANE THEATRE, ON HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTHDAY, 1761. Genius, neglected, mourns his wither'd bays; But soars to heav'n from virtue's generous praise. When Kings themselves the proper judges sit O'er the blest realms of science, arts and wit, Each eager breast beats high for glorious fame, And emulation glows with active flame. Thus, with Augustus rose imperial Rome, For arms renown'd abroad, for arts at home. Thus, when Eliza fill'd Britannia's throne, What arts, what learning was not then our own? Then sinew'd Genius, strong and nervous rose, In Spenser's numbers, and in Raleigh's prose; On Bacon's lips then every science hung, And Nature spoke from her own Shakespeare's tongue. Her patriot smiles fell, like refreshing dews, To wake to life each pleasing useful Muse, While every virtue which the Queen profess'd, Beam'd on her subjects, but to make them blest. O glorious times!—O theme of praise divine! —Be happy, Briton, then—such times are thine. Behold e'en now strong science imps her wing, And arts revive beneath a Patriot King. The Muses too burst forth with double light, To shed their lustre in a Monarch's sight. His cheering smiles alike to all extend— Perhaps this spot may boast a Royal Friend. And when a Prince, with early judgment grac'd, Himself shall marshal out the way to taste, Caught with the flame perhaps e'en here may rise Some powerful genius of uncommon size, And, pleas'd with nature, nature's depths explore, And be what our great Shakespeare was before. ODE SPOKEN ON A PUBLIC OCCASION AT WESTMINSTER SCHOOL. Nor at Apollo's vaunted shrine, Nor to the fabled Sisters Nine, Offers the youth his ineffectual vow. Far be their rites!—Such worship fits not now; When at Eliza's sacred name Each breast receives the present flame: While eager genius plumes her infant wings, And with bold impulse strikes th' accordant strings, Reflecting on the crouded line Of mitred sages, bards divine, Of patriots, active in their country's cause, Who plan her councils, or direct her laws. Oh Memory! how thou lov'st to stray, Delighted, o'er the flow'ry way Of childhood's greener years! when simple youth Pour'd the pure dictates of ingenuous truth! 'Tis then the souls congenial meet, Inspir'd with friendship's genuine heat, Ere interest, frantic zeal, or jealous art, Have taught the language foreign to the heart. 'Twas bere, in many an early strain Dryden first try'd his classic vein, Spurr'd his strong genius to the distant goal, In wild effusions of his manly soul; When Busby's skill, and judgment sage, Repress'd the poet's frantic rage, Cropt his luxuriance bold, and blended taught The flow of numbers with the strength of thought. Nor, Cowley, be thy Muse forgot! which strays In wit's ambiguous flowery maze, With many a pointed turn and studied art: Tho' affectation blot thy rhyme, Thy mind was lofty and sublime, And manly honour dignified thy heart: Though fond of wit, yet firm to virtue's plan, The Poet's trifles ne'er disgrac'd the Man. Well might thy morals sweet engage Th' attention of the Mitred Sage, Smit with the plain simplicity of truth. For not ambition's giddy strife, The gilded toys of public life, Which snare the gay unstable youth, Cou'd lure Thee from the sober charms, Which lapt thee in retirements' arms, Whence Thou, untainted with the pride of state, Coud'st smile with pity on the bustling Great. Such were Eliza's sons. Her fost'ring care Here bad free genius tune his grateful song; Which else had wasted in the desart air, Or droop'd unnotic'd 'mid the vulgar throng. —Ne'er may her youth degenerate shame The glories of Eliza's name! But with the poet's frenzy bold, Such as inspir'd her bards of old, Pluck the green laurel from the hand of fame! ARCADIA. A DRAMATIC PASTORAL. SCENE I. A view of the country. SHEPHERDS AND SHEPHERDESSES. CHORUS. Shepherds, buxom, blithe and free, Now's the time for jollity. SYLVIA.AIR. Hither haste, and bring along Merry tale and jocund song. To the pipe and tabor beat Frolic measures with your feet. Ev'ry gift of time employ; Make the most of proffer'd joy. Pleasure hates the scanty rules Portion'd out by dreaming fools. CHORUS. Shepherds, buxom, blithe and free, Now's the time for jollity. A dance of Shepherds, &amp;c. SYLVIA.RECITATIVE. Rejoice, ye happy swains, rejoice; It is the heart that prompts the voice. Be sorrow banish'd far away; Thyrsis shall make it holy-day. Who at his name can joy suppress? Arcadian-born to rule and bless. DAMON. And hark! from rock to rock the sound Of winding horn, and deep-mouth'd hound, Breaking with rapture on the ear, Proclaims the blithsome Phœbe near: See where she hastes with eager pace, To speak the joys that paint her face. SCENE II. Opens to a prospect of rocks. Huntsmen, Huntresses, &amp;c. coming down from them. PHOEBE. Hither I speed with honest glee, Such as befits the mind that's free; Your chearful troop, blithe youth, to join, And mix my social joys with thine. Now may each nymph, and frolic swain, O'er mountain steep, or level plain, Court buxom health, while jocund horn Bids echo wake the sluggard morn. AIR. When the morning peeps forth, and the zephyr's cool gale, Carries fragrance and health over mountain and dale; Up, ye nymphs, and ye fwains, and together we'll rove, Up hill, down the valley, by thicket or grove: Then follow with me, where the welkin refounds With the notes of the horns, and the cry of the hounds. Let ther wretched be slaves to ambition and wealth; All the bleffing we ask is the blessing of health. So shall innocence self give a warrant to joys No envy disturbs, no dependance destroys. Then follow with me, where the welkin resounds With the notes of the horn, and the cry of the hounds. O'er hill, dale, and woodland, with rapture we roam; Yet returning, ftill find the dear pleafures at home; Where the chearful good humour gives honesty grace, And the heart speaks content in the smiles of the face. Then sollow with me, where the welkin resounds With the notes of the horn, and the cry of the hounds. DAMÆTAS. RECITATIVE. Small care, my friends, your youth annoys, Which only looks to present joys. SYLVIA. Though the white locks of siver'd age, And long experience hail thee fage; Ill fuits it in this joy, to wear A brow so over-hung with care. Better with us thy voice to raife, And join a whole Arcadia's praife. DAMÆTAS. With you I joy that Thyrsis reigns The guardian o'er his native plains: But praise is scanty to reveal The speaking blessings all must feel. DAMON. True, all must feel — but thankless too? Nor give to virtue, virtue's due? My grateful heart shall ever shew The debt I need not blush to owe. AIR. That I go where I lift, that I fing what I pleafe, That my labour's the price of contentment and eafe, That no care from abroad my retirement annoys, That at home I can taste the true family joys, That my kids wanton fafely o'er meadows and rocks, That my sheep graze fecure from the robber or fox; Thefe are blessings I share with the rest of the swains, For it's Thyrisis who gave them, and Thyrisis maintains. DAMÆTAS. RECITATIVE. Perifh my voice, if e'er I blame Thy duty to our guardian's name! His active talents I revere, But eye them with a jealous fear. Intent to form our bliss alone, The generous youth forgets his own; Nor e'er his busy mind employs To find a partner of his joys. So might his happy offspring own The virtues which their fire hath shewn. AIR. With joy the parent loves to trace Resemblance in his children's face: And as he forms their docile youth To wald the steady paths of truth, Obferves them shooting into men, And lives in them life o'er again. While active fons, with eager flame, Catch virtue at their father's name; When full of glory, full of age, The parent quits this busy stage, What in the fons we most admire, Calls to new life the nonour'd fire. SYLVIA. RECITATIVE. O prudent Sage forgive the zeal Of thoughtless youth. With thee I feel, The glories now Arcadia shares May but embitter future cares. Oh mighty Pan! attend Arcadia's voice, Inspire, direct, and fanctify his choice. AIR. So may all thy fylvan train, Dryad, nymph, and ruftic faun, To the pipe and merry strain, Trip it o'er the russet lawn! May no thorn or bearded grass Hurt their fottsteps as they pass, Whilst in gambols round and round They sport it o'er the shaven ground! Though thy Syrinx, like a dream, Flying at the face of day, Vanish'd in the limpid stream, Bearing all thy hopes away, If again thy heart should burn, In careffing, Blest, and blessing, May'st thou find a wish'd return. CHORUS. O mighty Pan! attend Arcadia's voice, Inspire, direct, and fanctify his choice. [A dance of huntsmen and huntresses.] DAMÆTAS. RECITATIVE. Peace, shepherds, peace, with jocund air, Which Speaks a heart unknown to care, Young Delia hastes. The glad furprize Of rapure flashing from her eyes. ENTER DELIA. DELIA. AIR. Shepherds, shepherds, come away; Sadness were a sin to-day. Let the pipe's merry notes aid the skill of the voice; For our wishes are crown'd, and our hearts shall rejoice. Rejoice, and be glad; For fure he is mad Who, where mirth and good humour, and harmony's found, Never catches the fmile, nor let pleasure go round. Let the stupid be grave, 'Tis the vice of the slave; But can never agree Will a maiden like me, Who is born in a country that's happy and free. DAMÆTAS. RECITATIVE. What means this rapture, Delia? Shew Th' event our bosoms burn to know. DELLA. Now as I trod yon verdant fide, Where Ladon rolls its filver tide, All gayly deck'd in gorgeous state, Sail'd a proud barge of richest freight: Where fat a nymph, more fresh and fair Than blossoms which the morning air Steals perfume from; the modest grace Of maiden blush bespread her face. Hither it made, and on this strand Pour'd its rich freight for shepherds' land. Ladon, for this, smooth flow thy tide! The precious freight was Thyrifis' bride. DAMÆTAS. RECITATIVE. Stop, shepherds, if aright I hear, The sounds of joy proclaim them near: Lets meet them, friends, I'll lead the way; Joy makes me young again to-day. SCENE III. A view of the fea, with a vessel at a distance. [Here follows a Pastoral Procession to the wedding of Thyrsis.] PRIEST. RECITATIVE. Mighty Pan! with tender care, View this swain and virgin fair; May they ever thus impart Just return of heart for heart. May the pledges of their bliss Climb their knees to share the kifs. May their steady blooming youth, While they tread the paths of truth, Virtues catch from either fide, From the bridegroom and the bride. CHORUS. May their steady blooming youth, While they tread the paths of truth, Virtues catch from either side, From the bridegroom and the bride. AN EPISTLE TO MR. COLMAN. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1756. You know, dear George, I'm none of those That condescend to write in prose; Inspir'd with pathos and sublime, I always foar—in doggrel rhyme, And fcarce can ask you how you do, Without a jingling line or two. Befides, I always took delight in What bears the name of easy writing; Perhaps the reason makes it please Is, that I find it's writ with ease. I vent a notion here in private, Which public taste can ne'er connive at, Which thinks no wit or judgment greater Than Addison and his Spectator, Who fays (it is no matter where, But that he fays it, I can swear) With easy verfe most Bards are smitten, Because they think it's easy written, Whereas the easier it appears, The greater marks of care it wears; Of which, to give an explanation, Take this by way of illustration: The fam'd Mat Prior, it is faid, Oft bit his nails, and scratch'd his head, And chang'd a thought a hundred times, Becaufe he did not like the rhymes. To make my meaning clear, and please ye, In short, he labour'd to write easy. And yet, no critic e'er defines His poems into labour'd lines. I have a fimile will hit him; His verfe, like clothes, was made to fit him, Which (as no Taylor e'er denied) The better fit, the more they're tried. Though I have mention'd Prior's name, Think not I aim at Prior's fame. 'Tis the refult of admiration To spend itfelf in imitation; If imitation may be faid, Which is in me by nature bred, And you have better proofs than these, That I'm idolater of eafe. Who, but a madman, would engage A Poet in the prefent age? Write what we will, our works bespeak us Imitatores, Servum Pecus. Tale, Elegy, or lofty Ode, We travel in the beaten road. The Proverb ftill sticks closely by us, Nil dictum, quod non dictum prius. The only comfort that I know Is, that 'twas faid an age ago, Ere Milton foar'd in thought fublime, Ere Pope refin'd the chink of rhyme, Ere Colman wrote in stile so pure, Or the great TWO the Connoisseur; Ere I burlesqu'd the rural cit, Proud to hedge in my scraps of wit, And happy in the close connexion, T' acquire fome name from their reflexion; So (the similitude is trite0 The moon still shines with borrow'd light, And, like the race of modern beaux, Ticks with the fun for her lac'd clothes. Methinks there is no better time To shew the ufe I make of rhyme, Than now, when I, who from beginning Was always fond of couplet-finning, Prefuming on good-nature's score, Thus lay my bantling at your door. The first advantage which I fee, Is, that I ramble loofe and free: The Bard indeed full oft complains, That rhymes are fetters, links, and cbains, And when he wants to leap the fence, Still keep him pris'ner to the sense. Howe'er in common-place he rage, Rhyme's like your fetters on the stage, Which when the player once hath wore, It makes him only strut the more, While, raving in pathetic strains, He shakes his legs to clank his chains. From rhyme, as from a handfome face, Nonfense acquires a kind of grace; I therefore give it all its scope, That fenfe may unperceiv'd elope: So minifters of bafelt tricks (I love a fling at Politicks) Amufe the nation, court, and king, With breaking F?kes, and hanging Byon; And make each puny rogue a prey, While they, the grater, slink away. This fimile perhaps would strike, If match'd with something more alike; Then take it dress'd a fecond time In prior's eafe, and my sublime. Say, did you never chance to meet A mob of people in the street, Ready to give the robb'd relief, And all in haste to catch a thief, While the sly rogue, who silch'd the prey, Too clofe befet to run away, Stop thief! stop thief! exclaims aloud, And so escapes among the croud? So Ministers, &amp;c. O England, how I mourn thy fate! For fure thy losses now are great; Two fuch what Briton can endure, Minorca and the Connoisseur! To-day, before the fun goes down, Will die the Cenfor, Mr. Town! He dies, whoe'er takes pains to con him, With blushing honours thick upon him; O may his name these verses fave, Be these inscrib'd upon his grave! Know, reader, that on Thursday died The Connoisseur, a suicide! Yet think not that his soul is fled, Nor rank him 'mongst the vulgar dead. Howe'er defunct you set him down, He's only going out of Town. THE PUFF. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE BOOKSELLER AND AUTHOR. BOOKSELLER. Museum, sir! that's not enough. New works, we know, require a Puff; A title to entrap the eyes, And catch the reader by surprize: As gaudy signs, which hang before The tavern or the alehouse door, Hitch every passer's observation, Magnetic in their invitation. —That Shakespeare is prodigious fine! Shall we step in, and taste the wine? Men, women, houses, horses, books, All borrow credit from their looks. Externals have the gift of striking, And lure the fancy into liking. AUTHOR. Oh! I perceive the thing you mean— Call it St. fames's Magazine. BOOKSELLER. Or the New British— AUTHOR. Oh! no more. One name's as good as half a score. And titles oft give nothing less Than what they staringly profess. Puffing, I grant, is all the mode; The common hackney turnpike road: But custom is the blockhead's guide, And such low arts disgust my pride. Success on merit's force depends, Not on the partial voice of friends; Not on the seems, that bully sin; But that which passeth shew within: Which bids the warmth of friendship glow, And wrings conviction from a foe.— Deserve Success, and proudly claim, Not steal a passage into fame. BOOKSELLER. Your method, sir, will never do; You're right in theory, it's true. But then, experience in our trade Says, there's no harm in some parade. Suppose we said, by Mr. Lloyd? AUTHOR. The very thing I wou'd avoid; And would be rather pleas'd to own Myself unknowing, and unknown: What could th' unknowing muse expect, But information or neglect? Unknown—perhaps her reputation Escapes the tax of defamation, And wrapt in darkness, laughs unhurt, While critic blockheads throw their dirt: But he who madly prints his name, Invites his foe to take sure aim. BOOKSELLER. True—but a name will always bring A better sanction to the thing: And all your scribbling foes are such, Their censure cannot hurt you much; And, take the matter ne'er so ill, If you don't print it, sir, they will. AUTHOR. Well, be it so—that struggle's o'er— Nay,—this shall prove one spur the more. Pleas'd if success attends, if not, I've writ my name, and made a blot. BOOKSELLER. But a good print. AUTHOR. The print? why there I trust to honest Leach's care. What is't to me? in verse or prose, I find the stuff, you make the cloaths: And paper, print, and all such dress, Will lose no credit from his press. BOOKSELLER. You quite mistake the thing I mean, —I'll fetch you, sir, a Magazine; You see that picture there,—the Queen. AUTHOR. A dedication to her too! What will not folly dare to do? O days of art! when happy skill Can raise a likeness whence it will; When portraits ask no Reynold's aid, And queens and kings are ready made. No, no, my friend, by helps like these, I cannot wish my work should please; No pictures taken from the life, Where all proportions are at strife; No Humming-Bird, no painted Flower, No Beast just landed in the Tower, No wooden Notes, no colour'd Map, No Country-Dance shall stop a gap; O Philomath, be not severe, If not one problem meets you here; Where gossip A, and neighbour B, Pair, like good friends, with C and D; And E F G, HIK join; And curve and incidental line Fall out, fall in, and cross each other, Just like a sister and a brother. Ye tiny poets, tiny wits, Who frisk about on tiny tits, Who words disjoin, and sweetly sing, Take one third part, and take the thing; Then close the joints again, to frame Some Lady's, or some City's name, Enjoy your own, your proper Phœbus; We neither make, nor print a Rebus. No Crambo, no Acrostic fine, Great letters lacing down each line; No strange Conundrum, no invention Beyond the reach of comprehension, No Riddle, which whoe'er unties, Claims twelve Museums for the Prize, Shall strive to please you, at th' expence Of simple taste, and common sense. BOOKSELLER. But would not Ornament produce Some real grace, and proper use? A Frontispiece would have its weight, Neatly engrav'd on copper-plate. AUTHOR. Plain letter-press shall do the feat, What need of foppery to be neat? The Paste-board Guard delights me more, That stands to watch a bun-house door, Than such a mockery of grace, And ornament so out of place. BOOKSELLER. But one word more, and I have done— A Patent might insure its run. AUTHOR. Patent! for what! can patents give A Genius? or make blockheads live? If so, O hail the glorious plan! And buy it at what price you can. But what alas! will that avail, Beyond the property of sale? A property of little worth, If weak our produce at its birth. For fame, for honest fame we strive, But not to struggle half alive, And drag a miserable being, Its end still fearing and foreseeing. Oh! may the flame of genius blaze, Enkindled with the breath of praise! But far be ev'ry fruitless puff, To blow to light a dying snuff. BOOKSELLER. But should not something, sir, be said, Particular on ev'ry head? What your Originals will be, What infinite variety, Multum in Parvo, as they say, And something neat in every way? AUTHOR. I wish there could—but that depends Not on myself, so much as friends. I but set up a new machine, With harness tight, and furnish'd clean; Where such, who think it no disgrace, To send in time, and take a place, The book-keeper shall minute down, And I with pleasure drive to town. BOOKSELLER. Ay, tell them that, sir, and then say, What letters come in every day; And what great Wits your care procures, To join their social hands with yours. AUTHOR. What! must I huge proposals print, Merely to drop some saucy hint, That real folks of real fame Will give their works, and not their name? —This Puff's of use, you say—why let it, We'll boast such friendship when we get it. BOOKSELLER. Get it! Ah, sir, you do but jest, You'll have assistance, and the best. There's Churchill—will not Churchill lend Assistance? AUTHOR. Surely—to his Friend. BOOKSELLER. And then your interest might procure Something from either Connoisseur. Colman and Thornton, both will join Their social hand, to strengthen thine: And when your name appears in print, Will Garrick never drop a hint? AUTHOR. True, I've indulg'd such hopes before, From those you name, and many more; And they, perhaps, again will join Their hand, if not asham'd of mine. Bold is the task we undertake, The friends we wish, the Work must make: For Wits, like adjectives, are known To cling to that which stands alone. BOOKSELLER. Perhaps too, in our way of trade, We might procure some useful aid; Could we engage some able pen, To furnish matter now and then; There's—what's his name, sir? wou'd compile, And methodize the news in style. AUTHOR. Take back your newsman whence he came, Carry your crutches to the lame. BOOKSELLER. You must enrich your book, indeed! Bare Merit never will succeed; Which readers are not now a-days, By half so apt to buy, as praise; And praise is hardly worth pursuing, Which tickles authors to their ruin. Books shift about, like ladies' dress, And there's a fashion in success. But could not we, like little Bayes, Armies imaginary raise? And bid our generals take the field, To head the troops that lie conceal'd? Bid General Essay lead the van, By—Oh! the Style will shew the man: Bid Major Science bold appear, With all his pot-hooks in the rear. AUTHOR. True, true—our News, our Prose, our Rhymes, Shall shew the colour of the times; For which most salutary ends, We've fellow-soldiers, fellow-friends. For city, and for court affairs, My lord duke's butler, and the mayor's. For politics—eternal talkers, Profound observers, and park-walkers. For plays, great actors of renown, (Lately or just arriv'd in town) Or some, in state of abdication, Of oratorial reputation; Or those who live on scraps and bits, Mere green-room wasps, and Temple wits; Shall teach you, in a page or two, What Garrick should, or should not do. Trim poets from the City desk, Deep vers'd in rural picturesque, Who minute down, with wond'rous pains, What Rider's Almanack contains On flow'r and seed, and wind, and weather, And bind them in an Ode together; Shall thro' the seasons monthly sing Sweet Winter, Autumn, Summer, Spring. BOOKSELLER. Ah, sir! I see you love to jest, I did but hint things for the best. Do what you please, 'tis your design, And if it fails, no blame is mine; I leave the management to you, Your servant, sir, AUTHOR. I'm yours,—Adieu. CHIT-CHAT. AN IMITATION OF THEOCRITUS. Idyll. XV. ????? ????????, &amp;c. MRS. BROWN. Is Mistress Scot at home, my dear? SERVANT. Ma'm, is it you? I'm glad you're here. My Missess, tho' resolv'd to wait, Is quite unpatient—'tis so late. She fancy'd you would not come down, —But pray walk in, Ma'm—Mrs. Brown. MRS. SCOT. Your servant, Madam. Well, I swear I'd giv'n you over—Child, a chair. Pray, Ma'm, be seated. MRS. BROWN. Lard! my dear, I vow I'm almost dead with fear. There is such scrouging and such squeeging, The solks are all so disobliging; And then the waggons, carts and drays So clog up all these narrow ways, What with the bustle and the throng, I wonder how I got along. Besides the walk is so immense— Not that I grudge a coach expence, But then it jumbles me to death, —And I was always short of breath. How can you live so far, my dear? It's quite a journey to come here. MRS. SCOT. Lard! Ma'm, I left it all to Him, Husbands you know, will have their whim. He took this house.—This house! this den.— See but the temper of some men. And I, forsooth, am hither hurl'd, To live quite out of all the world. Husband, indeed! MRS. BROWN. Hist! lower, pray, The child hears every word you say. See how he looks— MRS. SCOT. Jacky, come here, There's a good boy, look up, my dear. 'Twas not papa we talk'd about. —Surely he cannot find it out. MRS. BROWN. See how the urchin holds his hands. Upon my life he understands. —There's a sweet child, come, kiss me, come, Will Jacky have a sugar-plumb? MRS. SCOT. This Person, Madam (call him so, And then the child will never know) From house to house would ramble out, And every night a drunken-bout. For at a tavern he will spend His twenty shillings with a friend. Your rabbits fricasseed and chicken, With curious choice of dainty picking, Each night got ready at the Crown, With port and punch to wash 'em down, Would scarcely serve this belly-glutton, Whilst we must starve on mutton, mutton. MRS. BROWN. My good man, too—Lord bless us! Wives Are born to lead unhappy lives, Altho' his profits bring him clear Almost two hundred pounds a year, Keeps me of cash so short and bare, That I have not a gown to wear; Except my robe, and yellow sack, And this old lutestring on my back. —But we've no time, my dear, to waste. Come, where's your cardinal, make haste. The King, God bless his majesty, I say, Goes to the house of lords to-day, In a fine painted coach and eight, And rides along in all his state. And then the Queen— MRS. SCOT. Aye, aye, you know, Great folks can always make a show. But tell me, do—I've never seen Her present majesty, the Queen. MRS. BROWN. Lard! we've no time for talking now, Hark!—one—two—three—'tis twelve I vow. MRS. SCOT. Kitty, my things,—I'll soon have done, It's time enough, you know, at one. —Why, girl! see how the creature stands! Some water here, to wash my hands. —Be quick—why sure the gipsy sleeps! —Look how the drawling daudle creeps. That bason there—why don't you pour, Go on, I say—stop, stop—no more— Lud! I could beat the hussey down, She's pour'd it all upon my gown. —Bring me my ruffles—can'st not mind? And pin my handkerchief behind. Sure thou hast aukwardness enough, Go—fetch my gloves, and fan, and muff. —Well, heav'n be prais'd—this work is done, I'm ready now, my dear—let's run. Girl,—put that bottle on the shelf, And bring me back the key yourself. MRS. BROWN. That clouded silk becomes you much, I wonder how you meet with such, But you've a charming taste in dress. What might it cost you, Madam? MRS. SCOT. Guess. MRS. BROWN. Oh! that's impossible—for I Am in the world the worst to buy. MRS. SCOT. I never love to bargain hard, Five shillings, as I think, a yard. —I was afraid it should be gone— 'Twas what I'd set my heart upon. MRS. BROWN. Indeed you bargain'd with success, For its a most delightful dress. Besides, it fits you to a hair, And then 'tis slop'd with such an air. MRS. SCOT. I'm glad you think so,—Kitty, here, Bring me my cardinal, my dear. Jacky, my love, nay don't you cry, Take you abroad!—indeed not I; For all the Bugaboes to fright ye— Besides, the naughty horse will bite ye; With such a mob about the street, Bless me, they'll tread you under feet. Whine as you please, I'll have no blame, You'd better blubber, than be lame. The more you cry, the less you'll— —Come, come then, give mamma a kiss, Kitty, I say, here take the boy, And fetch him down the last new toy, Make him as merry as you can, —There, go to Kitty—there's a man. Call in the dog, and shut the door, Now, Ma'm, MRS. BROWN. Oh Lard! MRS. SCOT. Pray go before. MRS. BROWN. I can't indeed, now. MRS. SCOT. Madam, pray. MRS. BROWN. Well then, for once, I'll lead the way. MRS. SCOT. Lard! what an uproar! what a throng! How shall we do to get along? What will become of us?—look here, Here's all the king's horse-guards, my dear. Let us cross over—haste, be quick, —Pray sir, take care—your horse will kick. He'll kill his rider—he's so wild. —I'm glad I did not bring the child. MRS. BROWN. Don't be afraid, my dear, come on, Why don't you see the guards are gone? MRS. SCOT. Well, I begin to draw my breath; But I was almost scar'd to death. For when a horse rears up and capers, It always puts me in the vapours. For as I live,—nay, don't you laugh, I'd rather see a toad by half, They kick and prance, and look so bold, It makes my very blood run cold. But let's go forward—come, be quick, The crowd again grows vastly thick. MRS. BROWN. Come you from Palace-yard, old dame? OLD WOMAN. Troth, do I, my young ladies, why? MRS. BROWN. Was it much crouded when you came? MRS. SCOT. And is his majesty gone by? MRS. BROWN. Can we get in, old lady, pray To see him robe himself to-day? MRS. SCOT. Can you direct us, dame? OLD WOMAN. Endeavour, Troy could not stand a siege for ever. By srequent trying, Troy was won, All things, by trying, may be done. MRS. BROWN. Go thy ways, Proverbs—well—she's gone— Shall we turn back, or venture on? Look how the folks press on before, And throng impatient at the door. MRS. SCOT. Perdigious! I can hardly stand, Lord bless me, Mrs.Brown, your hand; And you, my dear, take hold of hers, For we must stick as close as burrs, Or in this racket, noise and pother, We certainly shall lose each other. —Good God! my cardinal and sack Are almost torn from off my back. Lard, I shall faint—Oh Lud—my breast— I'm crush'd to atoms, I protest. God bless me—I have dropt my fan, —Pray did you see it, honest man? MAN. I, madam! no,—indeed, I fear You'll meet with some misfortune here. —Stand back, I say—pray, sir, forbear— Why, don't you see the ladies there? Put yourselves under my direction, Ladies, I'll be your safe protection. MRS. SCOT. You're very kind, sir; truly few Are half so complaisant as you. We shall be glad at any day This obligation to repay, And you'll be always sure to meet A welcome, sir, in—Lard! the street Bears such a name, I can't tell how To tell him where I live, I vow. —Mercy! what's all this noise and stir? Pray is the King a coming, sir? MAN. No—don't you hear the people shout? 'Tis Mr.Pitt, just going out. MRS. BROWN. Aye, there he goes, pray heav'n bless him! Well may the people all caress him. —Lord, how my husband us'd to sit, And drink success to honest Pitt, And happy o'er his evening cheer, Cry, you shall pledge this toast, my dear. MAN. Hist—silence—don't you hear the drumming? Now, ladies, now, the King's a coming. There, don't you see the guards approach? MRS. BROWN. Which is the King? MRS. SCOT. Which is the coach? SCOTCHMAN. Which is the noble Earl of Bute, Geud-faith, I'll gi him a salute. For he's the Laird of aw our clan, Troth, he's a bonny muckle man. MAN. Here comes the Coach, so very slow As if it ne'er was made to go, In all the gingerbread of state, And staggering under its own weight. MRS. SCOT. Upon my word, its monstrous fine! Would half the gold upon't were mine! How gaudy all the gilding shews! It puts one's eyes out as it goes. What a rich glare of various hues, What shining yellows, scarlets, blues! It must have cost a heavy price; 'Tis like a mountain drawn by mice. MRS. BROWN. So painted, gilded, and so large, Bless me! 'tis like my lord mayor's barge. And so it is—look how it reels! 'Tis nothing else—a barge on wheels. MAN. Large! it can't pass St. James's gate, So big the coach, the arch so strait. It might be made to rumble thro' And pass as other coaches do. Could they a body-coachman get So most preposterously fit, Who'd undertake (and no rare thing) Without a head, to drive the king. MRS. SCOT. Lard! what are those two ugly things There—with their hands upon the springs, Filthy, as ever eyes beheld, With naked breasts, and faces swell'd? What could the saucy maker mean, To put such things to fright the Queen? MAN. Oh! they are Gods, Ma'm, which you see, Of the Marine Society. Tritons, which in the ocean dwell, And only rise to blow their shell. MRS. SCOT. Gods, d'ye call those filthy men? Why don't they go to sea again? Pray, tell me, sir, you understand, What do these Tritons do on land? MRS. BROWN. And what are they? those hindmost things, Men, fish and birds, with flesh, scales, wings? MAN. Oh, they are Gods too, like the others, All of one family and brothers, Creatures, which seldom come a-shore, Nor seen about the King before. For Show, they wear the yellow Hue, Their proper colour is True-blue. MRS. SCOT. Lord bless us! what's this noise about? Lord, what a tumult and a rout! How the folks holla, hiss, and hoot! Well—Heav'n preserve the Earl of Bute! I cannot stay, indeed, not I, If there's a riot I shall die. Let's make for any house we can, Do—give us shelter, honest man. MRS. BROWN. I wonder'd where you was, my dear, I thought I should have died with fear. This noise and racketing and hurry Has put my nerves in such a flurry! I could not think where you was got, I thought I'd lost you, Mrs.Scot; Where's Mrs. Tape, and Mr.Grin? Lard, I'm so glad we're all got in. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND HIS FRIEND. FRIEND. You say, “it hurts you to the soul To brook confinement or controul.” And yet will voluntary run To that confinement you would shun, Content to drudge along the track, With bells and harness on your back. Alas! what genius can admit A monthly tax on spendthrift wit, Which often flings whole stores away, And oft has not a doit to pay! —Give us a work, indeed—of length— Something which speaks poetic strength; Is sluggish fancy at a stand? No scheme of consequence in hand? I, nor your plan, nor book condemn, But why your name, and why A, M? AUTHOR. Yes—it stands forth to public view, Within, without, on white, on blue, In proper, tall, gigantic Letters, Not dash'd—emvowell'd—like my betters. And though it stares me in the face, Reflects no shame, hints no disgrace. While these unlaboured trifles please, Familiar chains are worn with ease. —Behold! to yours and my surprize, These trifles to a Volume rise. Thus will you see me, as I go, Still gath'ring bulk like balls of snow, Steal by degrees upon your shelf, And grow a giant from an elf. The current studies of the day, Can rarely reach beyond a Play: A Pamphlet may deserve a look, But Heav'n defend us from a Book! A Libel flies on Scandal's wings, But works of length are heavy things. —Not one in twenty will succeed— Consider, sir, how few can read. FRIEND. I mean a work of merit— AUTHOR. True. FRIEND. A man of Taste must buy. AUTHOR. Yes;—You And half a dozen more, my friend, Whom your good Taste shall recommend. Experience will by facts prevail, When argument and reason fail; The Nuptials now— FRIEND. Whose nuptials, sir?— AUTHOR. A Poet's—did that poem stir? No—fixt—tho' thousand readers pass, It still looks through its pane of glass, And seems indignant to exclaim Pass on ye Sons of Taste, for shame! While duly each revolving moon, Which often comes, God knows too soon, Continual plagues my soul molest, And Magazines disturb my rest, While scarce a night I steal to bed, Without a couplet in my head, And in the morning, when I stir, Pop comes a Devil, “Copy sir.” I cannot strive with daring flight To reach the bold Parnassian Height; But at its foot, content to stray, In easy unambitious way, Pick up those flowers the muses send, To make a nosegay for my friend. In short, I lay no idle claim To genius strong, and noisy fame. But with a hope and wish to please, I write, as I would live, with ease. FRIEND. But you must have a fund, a mine, Prose, poems, letters AUTHOR. Not a line. And here, my friend, I rest secure; He can't lose much, who's always poor. And if, as now, thro' numbers five, This work with pleasure kept alive, Can still its currency afford, Nor fear the breaking of its hoard, Can pay you, as at sundry times, For self per Mag, two thousand Rhimes, From whence should apprehension grow, That self should fail, with richer Co? No doer of a monthly grub, Myself alone a learned club, I ask my readers to no treat Of scientifick hash'd-up meat, Nor seek to please theatric friends With scraps of plays, and odds and ends.— FRIEND. Your method, sir, is plain enough; And all the world has read your Puff. See a Poem, called the Puff, in the first Volume of Mr. Lloyd's Magazine. Th' allusion's neat, expression clean, About your travelling Machine, But yet—it is a Magazine. AUTHOR. Why let it be, and wherefore shame? As Juliet says, what's in a name? Besides it is the way of trade, Through which all science is convey'd, Thus knowledge parcels out her shares; The Court has hers, the Lawyers theirs. Something to Scholars sure is due,— Why not one Magazine for You? FRIEND. That's an Herculean task, my friend, You toil and labour—to offend. Part of your scheme—a free translation, To Scholars is a profanation; What! break up Latin! pull down Greek! (Peace to the soul of sir John Cheeke! The first restorer of Greek learning in England. And shall the gen'rous liquor run, Broach'd from the rich Falernian tun? Will you pour out to English swine, Neat as imported, old Greek wine? Alas! such beverage only fits Collegiate tastes, and classic wits. AUTHOR. I seek not, with satyric stroke, To strip the pedant of his cloak; No—let him cull and spout quotations, And call the jabber, demonstrations; Be his the great concern to shew, If Roman gowns were tied or no; See Sigonius and Manutius. Whether the Grecians took a slice Four times a-day, or only twice, Still let him work about his hole, Poor, busy, blind, laborious mole; Still let him puzzle, read, explain, Oppugn, remark, and read again. Such, though they waste the midnight oil In dull, minute, perplexing toil, Not understanding, do no good, Nor can do harm, not understood. By scholars, apprehend me right, I mean the learned, and polite, Whose knowledge unaffected flows, And sits as easy as their cloaths; Who care not though an ac or sed Misplac'd, endanger Priscian's head; Nor think his wit a grain the worse, Who cannot frame a Latin verse, Or give the Roman proper word To things the Romans never heard. 'Tis true, except among the Great, Letters are rather out of date, And quacking genius more discerning, Scoffs at your regulars in learning. —Pedants, indeed, are learning's curse, But Ignorance is something worse: All are not blest with reputation, Built on the want of Education, And some, to letters duly bred, Mayn't write the worse, because they've read. Though books had better be unknown, Than not one thought appear our own; As some can never speak themselves, But through the authors on their shelves, Whose writing smacks too much of reading, As affectation spoils good breeding. FRIEND. True; but that fault is seldom known, Save in your bookish college drone, Who, constant (as I've heard them say) Study their fourteen hours a-day, And squatting close, with dull attention, Read themselves out of apprehension; Who scarce can wash their hands or face, For fear of losing time, or place, And give one hour to meat and drink, But never half a one to think. AUTHOR. Lord! I have seen a thousand such, Who read, or seem to read, too much. So have I known, in that rare place, Where Classics always breed disgrace, A wight, upon discoveries hot, As whether flames have heat or not, Study himself, poor sceptic dunce, Into the very fire at once, And clear the philosophic doubt, By burning all ideas out. With such, eternal books successive Lead to no sciences progressive, While each dull fit of study past, Just like a wedge drives out the last. From these I ground no expectation Of genuine wit, or free translation; But you mistake me, friend. Suppose, (Translations are but modern cloaths) I dress my boy—(for instance sake Maintain these children, which I make) I give him coat and breeches— FRIEND. True— But not a bib and apron too! You would not let your child be seen, But drest consistent, neat, and clean. AUTHOR. So would I cloath a free translation, Or as Pope calls it, imitation; Not pull down authors from my shelf, To spoil their wit, and plague myself, My learning studious to display, And lose their spirit by the way. FRIEND. Your Horace now—e'en borrow thence His casy wit, his manly sense, But let the Moralist convey Things in the manners of to-day, Rather than that old garb assume, Which only suits a man at Rome. AUTHOR. Originals will always please, And copies too, if done with ease. Would not old Plautus wish to wear, Turn'd English host, an English air, If Thornton, rich in native wit, Would make the modes and diction fit? Or, as I know you hate to roam, To fetch an instance nearer home; Though in an idiom most unlike, A similarity must strike, Where both of simple nature fond, In art and genius correspond; And naive both (allow the phrase Which no one English word conveys) Wrapt up their stories neat and clean, Easy as— FRIEND. Denis's you mean. —The very man—not mere translation, But La Fontaine by transmigration. AUTHOR. Authors, as Dryden's maxim runs, Have what he calls poetic sons. Thus Milton, more correctly wild, Was richer Spenser's lawful child. And Churchill, got on all the nine, Is Dryden's heir in ev'ry line. Thus Denis proves his parents plain, The child of Ease, and La Fontaine. FRIEND. His muse, indeed, the work secures, And asks our praise as much as yours; For, if delighted, readers too May pay their thanks, as well as you. But You, my friend (so folks complain) For ever in this easy vein, This prose in verse, this measur'd talk, This pace, that's neither trot nor walk, Aim at no flights, nor strive to give A real poem fit to live. AUTHOR. (To critics no offence, I hope) Prior shall live as long as Pope, Each in his manner sure to please, While both have strength, and both have ease; Yet though their various beauties strike, Their ease, their strength is not alike. Both with consummate horseman's skill, Ride as they list, about the hill; But take, peculiar in their mode, Their favourite horse, and favourite road. For me, once fond of author-fame, Now forc'd to bear its weight and shame, I have no time to run a race, A traveller's my only pace. They, whom their steeds unjaded bear Around Hyde-park, to take the air, May frisk and prance, and ride their sill, And go all paces which they will; We, hackney tits—nay, never smile, Who trot our stage of thirty mile, Must travel in a constant plan, And run our journey, as we can. FRIEND. A critic says, upon whose sleeve Some pin more faith than you'll believe, That writings which as easy please, Are not the writings wrote with ease. From whence the inference is plain, Your friend Mat Prior wrote with pain. AUTHOR. With pain perhaps he might correct, With care supply each loose defect, Yet sure, if rhime, which seems to flow, Whether its master will or no, If humour, not by study sought, But rising from immediate thought, Are proofs of ease, what hardy name Shall e'er dispute a Prior's claim! But still your critic's observation Strikes at no Poet's reputation, His keen reslection only hits Your rhiming fops, and pedling wits. As some take stiffness for a grace, And walk a dancing-master's pace, And others, for familiar air Mistake the slouching of a bear; So some will finically trim, And dress their lady-muse too prim, Others, mere slovens in their pen (The mob of Lords and Gentlemen) Fancy they write with ease and pleasure, By rambling out of rhime and measure. And, on your critic's judgment, these Write easily, and not with Ease. There are, indeed, whose wish pursues, And inclination courts the muse; Who, happy in a partial fame, A while possess a poet's name, But read their works, examine fair, —Shew me invention, fancy there, Taste I allow; but is the flow Of genius in them? Surely, no. 'Tis labour from the classic brain. Read your own Addison's Campaign. E'en he, nay, think me not severe, A critic fine, of Latin ear, Who toss'd his classic thoughts around With elegance on Roman ground, Just simmering with the muse's flame Woos but a cool and sober dame; And all his English rhimes express But beggar-thoughts in royal dress. In verse his genius seldom glows, A Poet only in his prose, Which rolls luxuriant, rich, and chaste, Improved by Fancy, Wit, and Taste. FRIEND. I task you for yourself, my friend, A subject you can ne'er defend, And you cajole me all the while With dissertations upon stile. Leave others wits and works alone, And think a little of your own, For Fame, when all is said and done, Tho' a coy mistress, may be won; And half the thought, and pains, and time, You take to jingle easy rhime, Would make an Ode, would make a Play, Done into English, Malloch's way, —Stretch out your more Heroic feet, And write an Elegy complete. Or, not a more laborious task, Could not you pen a Classic Masque? AUTHOR. With will at large, and unclogg'd wings, I durst not soar to such high things. For I, who have more phlegm than fire, Must understand, or not admire, But when I read with admiration, Perhaps I'll write in Imitation. FRIEND. But business of this monthly kind, Need that alone engross your mind. Assistance must pour in a-pace, New passengers will take a place, And then your friends— AUTHOR. Aye, they indeed, Might make a better work succeed, And with the helps which they shall give, I and the Magazine shall live. FRIEND. Yes, live, and eat, and nothing more. AUTHOR. I'll live as—Authors did before. THE POET. ANEPISTLE TO C. CHURCHILL. Well—shall I wish you joy of fame, That loudly echoes Churchill's name, And sets you on the Muses' throne, Which right of conquest made your own? Or shall I (knowing how unfit The world esteems a man of wit, That wheresoever he appears, They wonder if the knave has ears) Address with joy and lamentation, Condolance and Congratulation, As colleges, who duly bring Their mess of verse to every king, Too œconomical in taste, Their sorrow or their joy to waste; Mix both together, sweet and sow'r; And bind the thorn up with the flow'r? Sometimes 'tis Elegy, or Ode. Epistle now's your only mode. Whether that style more glibly hits, The fancies of our rambling wits, Who wince and kick at all oppression, But love to straggle in digression; Or, that by writing to the Great In letters, honours, or estate, We slip more easy into fame, By clinging to another's name, And with their strength our weakness yoke, As ivy climbs about an oak; As Tuft-Hunters will buzz and purr About a Fellow-Commoner, Or Crows will wing a higher flight, When sailing round the floating kite. Whate'er the motive, 'tis the mode, And I will travel in the road. The fashionable track pursue, And write my simple thoughts to You, Just as they rise from head or heart, Not marshall'd by the herald Art. By vanity or pleasure led, From thirst of fame, or want of bread, Shall any start up sons of rhime Pathetic, Easy, or Sublime? —You'd think, to hear what Critics say, Their labour was no more than play: And that, but such a paultry station Reflects disgrace on education, (As if we could at once forsake What education helps to make) Each reader has superior skill, And can write better when he will. In short, howe'er you toil and drudge, The world, the mighty world, is judge, And nice and fanciful opinion Sways all the world with strange dominion; Opinion! which on crutches walks, And sounds the words another talks. Bring me eleven Critics grown, Ten have no judgment of their own: But, like the Cyclops watch the nod Of some informing master god. Or as, when near his latest breath, The patient fain would juggle death, When Doctors sit in Consultation (Which means no more than conversation, A kind of comfortable chat 'Mongst social friends, on This and That, As whether stocks get up or down, And tittle-tattle of the town; Books, pictures, politics, and news, Who lies with whom, and who got whose) Opinions never disagree, One doctor writes, all take the see. But eminence offends at once The owlish eye of critic dunce. Dullness alarm'd, collects her Force, And Folly screams till she is hoarse. Then far abroad the Libel flies From all th' artillery of lies, Malice, delighted, flaps her wing, And Epigram prepares her sting. Around the frequent pellets whistle From Satire, Ode, and pert Epistle; While every blockhead strives to throw His share of vengeance on his foe: As if it were a Shrove-tide game, And cocks and poets were the same. Thus should a wooden collar deck Some woe-full 'squire's embarrass'd neck, When high above the croud he stands With equi-distant sprawling hands, And without hat, politely bare, Pops out his head to take the air; The mob his kind acceptance begs Of dirt, and stones, and addle-eggs. O Genius! tho' thy noble skill Can guide thy Pegasus at will, Fleet let him bear thee as the wind— Dullness mounts up and clings behind, In vain you spur, and whip, and smack, You cannot shake her from your back. Ill-nature springs as merit grows, Close as the thorn is to the rose. Could Herculaneum's friendly earth Give Mævius' works a second birth, Malevolence, with lifted eyes, Would sanctify the noble prize. While modern critics should behold Their near relation to the old, And wondring gape at one another, To see the likeness of a brother. But with us rhiming moderns here, Critics are not the only fear; The poet's bark meets sharper shocks From other sands, and other rocks. Not such alone who understand, Whose book and memory are at hand, Who scientific skill profess, And are great adepts—more or less; (Whether distinguish'd by degree, They write A. M. or sign M. D. Or make advances somewhat higher And take a new degree of 'Squire.) Who read your authors, Greek and Latin, And bring you strange quotations pat in, As if each sentence grew more terse, From odds and ends, and scraps of verse; Who with true poetry dispense, So social sound suits simple sense, And load one Letter with the labours, Which should be shar'd among its neighbours. Who know that thought produces pain, And deep reflection mads the brain, And therefore, wise and prudent grown, Have no ideas of their own. But if the man of Nature speak, Advance their Bayonets of Greek, And keep plain sense at such a distance, She cannot give a friend assistance. Not these alone in judgment rise, And shoot at genius as it flies, But those who cannot spell, will Talk, As women scold, who cannot walk. Your man of habit, who's wound up To eat and drink, and dine and sup, But has not either will or pow'r To break out of his formal hour; Who lives by rule, and ne'er outgoes it; Moves like a clock, and hardly knows it; Who is a kind of breathing being, Which has but half the pow'r of seeing; Who stands for ever on the brink, Yet dare not plunge enough to think, Nor has one reason to supply Wherefore he does a thing, or why, But what he does proceeds so right, You'd think him always guided by't; Joins poetry and vice together Like sun and rain in April weather, Holds rake and wit as things the same, And all the difference but a Name. A Rake! Alas! how many wear The brow of mirth, with heart of care! The desperate wretch reslection flies, And shuns the way where madness lies, Dreads each increasing pang of grief, And runs to Folly for relief. There, 'midst the momentary joys Of giddy mirth and frantic noise, Forgetfulness, her eldest born, Smooths the World's hate, and blockhead's scorn, Then Pleasure wins upon the mind, Ye Cares, go whistle to the wind; Then welcome frolic, welcome whim! The world is all alike to him. Distress is all in apprehension; It ceases when 'tis past prevention: And happiness then presses near, When not a hope's left, nor a fear. —But you've enough, nor want my preaching, And I was never form'd for teaching. Male prudes we know, (those driv'ling things) Will have their gibes, and taunts, and flings. How will the sober Cit abuse, The sallies of the Culprit muse; To her and Poet shut the door— And whip the beggar, with his whore? Poet!—a Fool! a Wretch! a Knave! A mere mechanic dirty slave! What is his verse, but cooping sense Within an arbitrary fence? At best, but ringing that in rhime, Which prose would say in half the time? Measure and numbers! what are those But artificial chains for prose? Which mechanism quaintly joins In parallels of see-saw lines. And when the frisky wanton writes In Pindar's (what d'ye call 'em)—flights Th' uneven measure, short and tall, Now rhiming twice, now not at all, In curves and angles twirls about, Like chinese railing, in and out. Thus when you've labour'd hours on hours, Cull'd all the sweets, cull'd all the flow'rs, The churl, whose dull imagination Is dead to every fine sensation, Too gross to relish nature's bloom, Or taste her simple rich perfume, Shall cast them by as useless stuff, And fly with keeness to his—snuff. Look round the world, not one in ten Thinks Poets good, or honest men. 'Tis true their conduct, not o'er nice, Sits often loose to easy vice. Perhaps their Temperance will not pass The due rotation of the glass; And gravity denies 'em pow'r T' unpeg their hats at such an hour. Some vices must to all appear As constitutional as Fear; And every Moralist will find A ruling passion in the mind: Which, tho' pent up and barricado'd Like winds, where Æolus bravado'd; Like them, will sally from their den, And raise a tempest now and then; Unhinge dame Prudence from her plan, And ruffle all the world of man. Can authors then exemption draw From nature's, or the common law? They err alike with all mankind, Yet not the same indulgence find. Their lives are more conspicuous grown, More talk'd of, pointed at, and shewn, Till every error seems to rise To Sins of most gigantic size. Thus fares it still, however hard, With every wit, and ev'ry bard. His publick writings, private life, Nay more, his mistress, or his wife, And ev'ry social, dear connection, Must bear a critical dissection; While friends connive, and rivals hate, Scoundrels traduce, and blockheads bait. Perhaps you'll readily admit There's danger from the trading wit, And dunce and fool, and such as those, Must be of course the poet's foes: But sure no sober man alive, Can think that friends would e'er connive. From just remarks on carliest time, In the first infancy of rhime, It may be fairly understood There were two sects—the Bad, the Good. Both fell together by the ears, And both beat up for volunteers. By interest, or by birth allied, Numbers flock'd in on either side. Wit to his weapons ran at once, While all the cry was “down with Dunce!” Onward he led his social bands, The common cause had join'd their hands. Yet even while their zeal they show, And war against the gen'ral foe, Howe'er their rage flam'd fierce and cruel, They'd stop it all to fight a duel. And each cool wit would meet his brother, To pink and tilt at one another. Jealous of every puff of fame, The idle whist'ling of a name, The property of half a line, Whether a comma's yours or mine, Shall make a Bard a Bard engage, And shake the friendship of an age. But diffident and modest wit Is always ready to submit; Fearful of press and publication, Consults a brother's observation, Talks of the maggot of his brains, As hardly worth the critic pains; “If ought disgusts the sense or ear, “You cannot, sir, be too severe. “Expunge, correct, do what you will, “I leave it to superior skill; “Exert the office of a friend, “You may oblige, but can't offend.” This Bard too has his private clan, Where He's the great, the only man. Here, while the bottle and the bowl Promote the joyous flow of soul, (And sense of mind, no doubt, grows stronger When failing legs can stand no longer) Emphatic judgment takes the chair, And damns about her with an air. Then each, self-puff'd, and hero grown, Able to cope with hosts alone, Drawcansir like, his murders blends, First slays his foes, and then his friends. While your good word, or conversation, Can lend a brother reputation; While verse or preface quaintly penn'd, Can raise the consequence of friend, How visible the kind affection! How close the partial fond connection! Then He is quick, and I'm discerning, And I have wit, and He has learning, My judgment's strong, and His is chaste, And Both—ay Both, are men of taste. Should you nor steal nor borrow aid, And set up for yourself in trade, Resolv'd imprudently to show That 'tis not always Wit and Co. Feelings, before unknown, arise, And Genius looks with jealous eyes. Tho' thousands may arrive at fame, Yet never take one path the same. An Author's vanity or pride Can't bear a neighbour by his side, Altho' he but delighted goes Along the track which nature shows, Nor ever madly runs astray, To cross his brother in his way. And some there are, whose narrow minds, Center'd in self, self always blinds, Who, at a friends re-echoed praise, Which their own voice conspir'd to raise, Shall be more deep and inly hurt, Than from a foe's insulting dirt. And some, too timid to reveal That glow of heart, and forward zeal, Which words are scanty to express, But friends must feel from friends' success, When full of hopes and fears, the Muse, Which every breath of praise pursues, Wou'd open to their free embrace, Meet her with such a blasting face, That all the brave imagination, Which seeks the sun of approbation, No more its early blossoms tries, But curls its tender leaves, and dies. Is there a man, whose genius strong, Rolls like a rapid stream along, Whose Muse, long hid in chearless night, Pours on us like a flood of light, Whose acting comprehensive mind Walks Fancy's regions, unconfin'd; Whom, nor the surly sense of pride, Nor affectation, warps aside; Who drags no author from his shelf, To talk on with an eye to self; Careless alike, in conversation, Of censure, or of approbation; Who freely thinks, and freely speaks, And meets the Wit he never seeks; Whose reason calm, and judgment cool, Can pity, but not hate a fool; Who can a hearty praise bestow, If merit sparkles in a foe; Who bold and open, firm and true, Flatters no friends—yet loves them too: Churchill will be the last to know His is the portrait, I would show. THE TWO RUBRIC POSTS. A DIALOGUE. In Russel-sireet, ensued of late, Between two posts a strange debate. —Two posts—aye posts—for posts can speak, In Latin, Hebrew, Frencb or Greek, One Rubric thus address'd the other: “—A noble situation, brother, “With authors lac'd from top to toe, “Methinks we cut a taring show, “The Dialogues of famous dead, “You know how much they're bought and read. “Suppose again we raise their ghosts, “And make them chat through us two posts; “A thing's half finish'd well begun, “So take the authors as they run. “The list of names is mighty fine, “You look down this, and I that line. “Here's Pope and Swift, and Steele and Gay, “And Congreve, in the modern way. “Whilst you have those, I cannot speak, “But sound most wonderful in Greek. “—A Dialogue—I should adore it, “With such a show of names before it.” “Modern, your judgment wanders wide,” The antient Rubric strait reply'd. “It grieves me much, indeed, to find “We never can be of a mind, “Besore one door, and in one street, “Neither ourselves nor thoughts can meet, “And we, as brother oft with brother, “Are at a distance from each other. “Suppose among the letter'd dead, “Some author should erect his head, “And starting from his Rubric, pop “Directly into Davies' shop, “Turn o'er the leaves, and look about “To find his own opinions out; “D'ye think one author out of ten “Would know his sentiments agen? “Thinking your authors differ less in “Than in their manner of expressing. “'Tis stile which makes the writer known, “The mark he sets upon his own. “Let Congreve speak as Congreve writ, “And keep the ball up of his wit; “Let Swift be Swift, nor e'er demean “The sense and humour of the Dean. “E'en let the antients rest in peace, “Nor bring good folks from Rome or Greece “To give a cause for past transactions, “They never dreamt of in their actions. “I can't help quibbling, brother post, “'Twere better we should lay the ghost, “But 'twere a task of real merit “Could we contrive to raise their Spirit. “Peace, brother, peace, tho' what you say, “I own has reason in its way, “On Dialogues to bear so hard, “Is playing with a dang'rous card; “Writers of rank are sacred things, “And crush like arbitrary kings. “Perhaps your sentiment is right, “Heav'n grant we may not suffer by't. “For should friend Davies overhear, “He'll publish ours another year.” SONG. [Though winter its desolate train] Though winter its desolate train Of frost and of tempest may bring, Yet Flora steps forward again, And nature rejoices in spring. Though the sun in his glories decreast, Of his beams in the evening is shorn, Yet he rises with joy from the east, And repairs them again in the morn. But what can youth's sunshine recall, Or the blossoms of beauty restore? When its leaves are beginning to fall, It dies, and is heard of no more. The spring-time of love then employ, 'Tis a lesson that's easy to learn, For Cupid's a vagrant, a boy, And his seasons will never return. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO J.B. ESQ. Shall i, from worldly friends estrang'd, Embitter much, but nothing chang'd In that Affection firm and true, Which Gratitude excites to You; Shall I indulge the Muse, or stifle This meditation of a trifle? But you, perhaps, will kindly take The trifle for the Giver's sake, Who only pays his grateful Mite, The just acknowledgment of Right, As to the Landlord duly sent A pepper-corn shall pass for rent. Yet Trifles often shew the Man, More than his settled Life and Plan: These are the starts of inclination; Those the mere gloss of Education, Which has a wond'rous knack at turning A Blockhead to a man of Learning; And, by the help of form and place, The child of Sin to babe of Grace. Not that it alters Nature quite, And sets perverted Reason right, But, like Hypocrisy, conceals The very passions which she feels; And claps a Vizor on the face, To hide us from the World's disgrace, Which, as the first Appearance strikes, Approves of all things, or dislikes. Like the fond fool with eager glee, Who sold his all, and put to sea, Lur'd by the calm which seemed to sleep On the smooth surface of the Deep; Nor dreamt its waves could proudly rise, And toss up mountains at the skies. Appearance is the only thing, A King's a Wretch, a Wretch a King. Undress them both—You King, suppose For once you wear the beggar's cloaths; Cloaths that will take in every air; —Bless me! they sit you to a hair. Now you, Sir Vagrant, quickly don The robes his Majesty had on. And now, O World, so wond'rous wise, Who see with such discerning eyes, Put observation to the Stretch, Come—which is King, and which is Wretch? To cheat this World, the hardest task Is to be constant to our Mask. Externals make direct impressions And masks are worn by all Professions. What need to dwell on topics stale? Of Parsons drunk with wine or ale? Of Lawyers, who with face of brass, For learned Rhetoricians pass? Of Scientific Doctors big, Hid in the pent-house of their wig? Whose conversation hardly goes Beyond half words, and hums! and Oh's! Of Scholars, of superior taste, Who cork it up for fear of waste, Nor bring one bottle from their shelves, But keep it always for themselves? Wretches like these, my Soul disdains, And doubts their hearts as well as brains. Suppose a Neighbour should desire To light a candle at your fire, Would it deprive your flame of Light, Because another profits by't? But Youth must often pay its court, To these great Scholars, by report, Who live on hoarded reputation, Which dares no risque of Conversation, And boast within a store of Knowledge, Sufficient, bless us! for a College, But take a prudent care, no doubt, That not a grain shall straggle out; And are of Wit too nice and fine, To throw their Pearl and gold to Swine; And therefore, to prevent deceit, Think every Man a Hog they meet. These may perhaps as Scholars shine, Who hang themselves out for a Sign. What signifies a Lion's skin, If it conceals an Ass within? If thou'rt a Lion, prithee roar: If Ass—bray once, and stalk no more. In Words as well as Looks be wise, Silence is Folly in Disguise; With so much wisdom bottled up, Uncork, and give your friends a sup. What need your nothings thus to save? Why place the Dial in the Grave? A fig for Wit and Reputation, Which sneaks from all Communication. So in a post-bag, cheek by jole, Letters will go from pole to pole, Which may contain a wond'rous deal; But then they travel under seal, And though they bear your Wit about, Yet who shall ever find it out, Till trusty Wax forgoes its use, And sets imprison'd meaning loose? Yet idle Folly often deems What Man must be from what He seems; As if, to look a dwelling o'er, You'd go no farther than the Door. Mark yon round Parson, fat and sleek, Who preaches only once a Week, Whom Claret, Sloth, and Ven'son join To make an orthodox Divine; Whose Holiness receives its beauty From Income large, and little Duty; Who loves the Pipe, the Glass, the Smock, And keeps—a Curate for his Flock. The world, obsequious to his nod, Shall hail this oily man of God, While the poor priest, with half a score Of prattling infants at his Door, Whose sober Wishes ne'er regale Beyond the homely jug of Ale, Is hardly deem'd companion fit For Man of Wealth, or Man of Wit, Though learn'd perhaps and wise as He Who signs with staring S. T. P. And full of sacerdotal Pride, Lays God and Duty both aside. “This Curate, say you, learn'd and wise! “Why does not then this Curate rise? This Curate then, at forty-three, (Years which become a Curacy) At no great mart of Letters bred, Had strange odd notions in his head, That Parts, and Books, and Application, Furnish'd all means of Education; And that a pulpiteer should know More than his gaping flock below; That Learning was not got with pain, To be forgotten all again; That Latin words, and rumbling Greek, However charming sounds to speak, Apt or unapt in each Quotation, Were insults on a Congregation, Who could not understand one word Of all the learned stuff they heard; That something more than preaching fine, Should go to make a sound divine; That Church and Pray'r, and holy Sunday, Were no excuse for sinful Monday; That pious doctrine, pious Life, Should both make one, as Man and Wife. Thinking in this uncommon Mode, So out of all the priestly road, What Man alive can e'er suppose, Who marks the way Preferment goes, That she should ever find her way To this poor Curate's house of clay? Such was the Priest, so strangely wise! He could not bow—How should He rise? Learned He was, and deeply read; —But what of that?—not duly bred. For he had suck'd no grammar rules From Royal founts, or Public schools, Nor gain'd a single Corn of Knowledge From that vast Granary—a College. A Granary, which food supplies To vermin of uncommon Size. Aye, now indeed the Matter's clear, There is a mighty error here. A public school's the place alone, Where Talents may be duly known. It has, no doubt, its imperfections, But then, such Friendships! such connections! The Parent, who has form'd his Plan, And in his Child consider'd Man, What is his grand and golden Rule, “Make your connections, Child, at School. “Mix with your Equals, fly inferiors, “But follow closely your Superiors, “On Them your ev'ry Hope depends, “Be prudent, Tom, get useful Friends; “And therefore like a spider wait, “And spin your Web about the great. “If my Lord's Genius wants supplies, “Why—You must make his Exercise. “Let the young Marquis take your Place, “And bear a whipping sor his Grace. “Suppose (such Things may happen once) “The Nobles Wits, and You the Dunce, “Improve the means of Education, “And learn commodious Adulation. “Your Master scarcely holds it sin, “He chucks his Lordship on the Chin, “And would not for the World rebuke, “Beyond a pat, the school-boy Dake. “The Pastor there, of—what's the Place? “With smiles eternal in his Face, “With dimpling cheek, and snowy hand, “That shames the whiteness of his band; “Whose mincing Dialect abounds “In Hums and Hahs, and half-form'd sounds; “Whose Elocution, fine and chaste, “Lays his commainds with Judgment vaist; “And lest the Company should hear, “Whispers his Nothings in your Ear, “Think you 'twas Zeal, or Virtue's Care “That placed the smirking Doctor there. “No—'twas Connections form'd at School “With some rich Wit, or noble Fool, “Obsequious Flattery, and Attendance, “A wilful, useful, base dependance; “A supple bowing of the Knees “To any human God you please. “(For true good-breeding's so polite, “'Twould call the very Devil white) “'Twas watching others shifting Will, “And veering to and fro with Skill: “These were the means that made him rise, “Mind your connections, and be wise.” Methinks I hear son Tom reply, I'll be a Bishop by and by. Connections at a public School Will often serve a wealthy Fool, By lending him a letter'd Knave To bring him Credit, or to save; And Knavery gets a profit real, By giving parts and worth ideal. The child that marks this slavish Plan, Will make his Fortune when a Man. While honest Wit's ingenuous Merit Enjoys his pittance, and his Spirit. The Strength of public Education Is quick'ning Parts by Emulation; And Emulation will create In narrow minds a jealous state, Which stifled for a course of Years, From want of Skill or mutual Eears, Breaks out in manhood with a zeal, Which none but rival Wits can feel. For when good people Wits commence, They lose all other kind of sense; (The maxim makes you smile, I see, Retort it when you please on me) One writer always hates another, As Emperors would kill a brother, Or Empress Queen to rule alone, Pluck down a Husband from the throne. When tir'd of Friendship and alliance, Each side springs forward to defiance, Inveterate Hate and Resolution, Faggot and Fire and Persecution, Is all their aim, and all their Cry, Though neither side can tell you why. To it they run like valiant Men, And flash about them with their Pen. What Inkshed springs from Altercation! What loppings off of Reputation! You might as soon hush stormy Weather, And bring the North and South together, As reconcile your letter'd foes, Who come to all things but dry blows. Your desperate lovers wan and pale, As needy culprits in a jail, Who muse and doat, and pine, and die, Scorch'd by the light'ning of an eye, (For ladies' eyes, with fatal stroke, Will blast the veriest heart of oak) Will wrangle, bicker, and complain, Merely to make it up again. Though swain look glum, and miss look fiery, 'Tis nothing but amantium iræ, And all the progress purely this— A frown, a pout, a tear, a kiss. Thus love and quarrels (April weather) Like vinegar and oil together, Join in an easy mingled strife, To make the sallad up of life. Love settles best from altercation, As liquors after fermentation. In a stage-coach, with lumber cramm'd, Between two bulky bodies jamm'd, Did you ne'er writhe yourself about, To find the seat and cushion out? How disagreeably you sit, With b—m awry, and place unsit, Till some kind jolt o'er ill-pav'd town, Shall wedge you close, and nail you down, So fares it with your fondling dolts, And all love's quarrels are but jolts. When tiffs arise, and words of strife Turn one to two in man and wife, (For that's a matrimonial course Which yoke-mates must go through perforce, And ev'ry married man is certain T'attend the lecture call'd the curtain) Tho' not another word is said, When once the couple are in bed: There things their proper channel keep, (They make it up, and go to sleep) These fallings in and fallings out, Sometimes with cause, but most without, Are but the common modes of strife, Which oil the springs of married life, Where sameness would create the spleen, For ever stupidly serene. Observe yon downy bed—to make it, You toss the feathers up, and shake it. So fondness springs from words and scusfling, As beds lie smoothest after shuffling. But authors wranglings will create The very quintessence of hate; Peace is a fruitless vain endeavour, Sworn foes for once, they're foes for ever. —Oh! had it pleas'd my wiser betters That I had never tasted letters, Then no Parnassian maggots bred, Like fancies in a madman's head, No graspings at an idle name, No childish hope of future fame, No impotence of wit had ta'en Possession of my muse-struck brain. Or had my birth, with fortune fit, Varnish'd the dunce, or made the wit; I had not held a shameful place, Nor letters paid me with disgrace. —O! for a pittance of my own, That I might live unsought, unknown! Retir'd from all this pedant strife, Far from the cares of bust'ling life; Far from the wits, the fools, the great, And all the little world I hate. THE MILK-MAID. Whoe'er for pleasure plans a scheme, Will find it vanish like a dream, Affording nothing sound or real, Where happiness is all ideal; In grief, in joy, or either state, Fancy will always antedate, And when the thoughts on evil pore, Anticipation makes it more. Thus while the mind the future sees, It cancels all its present ease. Is Pleasure's scheme the point in view; How eagerly we all pursue! Well—Tuesday is th'appointed day; How slowly wears the time away! How dull the interval between, How darken'd o'er with clouds of spleen, Did not the mind unlock her treasure, And fancy feed on promis'd pleasure. Delia surveys, with curious eyes, The clouds collected in the skies; Wishes no storm may rend the air, And Tuesday may be dry and fair; And I look round, my boys, and pray, That Tuesday may be holiday. Things duly settled—what remains? Lo! Tuesday comes—alas! it rains; And all our visionary schemes Have died away, like golden dreams. Once on a time, a rustic dame, (No matter for the lady's name) Wrapt up in deep imagination, Indulg'd her pleasing contemplation; While on a bench she took her seat, And plac'd the milk-pail at her feet, Oft in her hand she chink'd the pence, The profits which arose from thence; While fond ideas fill'd her brain, Of layings up, and monstrous gain, Till every penny which she told, Creative fancy turn'd to gold; And reasoning thus from computation, She spoke aloud her meditation. “Please heav'n but to preserve my health, “No doubt I shall have store of wealth; “It must of consequence ensue “I shall have store of lovers too. “Oh! how I'll break their stubborn hearts, “With all the pride of female arts. “What Suitors then will kneel before me! “Lords, Earls, and Viscounts shall adore me. “When in my gilded coach I ride, “My Lady at his Lordship's side, “How will I laugh at all I meet “Clatt'ring in pattins down the street! “And Lobbin then I'll mind no more, “Howe'er I lov'd him heretofore; “Or, if he talks of plighted truth, “I will not hear the simple youth, “But rise indignant from my seat, “And spurn the lubber from my feet. Action, alas! the speaker's grace, Ne'er came in more improper place, For in the tossing forth her shoe, What fancied bliss the maid o'erthrew! While down at once, with hideous fall, Came lovers, wealth, and milk, and all. Thus fancy ever loves to roam, To bring the gay materials home; Imagination forms the dream, And accident destroys the scheme. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE, FROM THE REV. MR. HANBURY'S HORSE, TO THE REV. MR. SCOT. Amongst you bipeds, reputation Depends on Rank and Situation; And men increase in fame and worth, Not from their merits, but their Birth. Thus he is born to live obscure, Who has the sin of being poor; While wealthy dullness lolls at ease, And is—as witty as you please. —“What did his Lordship say?—O! fine! “The very Thing! Bravo! Divine!” And then 'tis buzz'd from Route to Route, While ladies whisper it about, “Well, I protest, a charming hit! “His Lerdship has a deal of wit. “How elegant that double sense! “Perdigious! vaistly fine! Immense! When all my lord has said or done, Was but the letting off a pun. Mark the fat Cit, whose good round sum, Amounts at least to half a Plumb; Whose chariot whirls him up and down Some three or four miles out of town; For thither sober folks repair, To take the Dust, which they call air. Dull folly (not the wanton wild Imagination's younger child) Has taken lodgings in his face, As finding that a vacant place, And peeping from his windows, tells To all beholders, where she dwells. Yet once a week, this purse-proud cit, Shall ape the sallies of a wit, And after ev'ry Sunday's dinner, To priestly saint, or city sinner, Shall tell the story o'er and o'er, H'as told a thousand times before; Like gamesters, who, with eager zeal, Talk the game o'er between the deal. Mark! how the fools and knaves admire And chuckle with their Sunday 'squire: While he looks pleas'd at every guest, And laughs much louder than the rest; And cackling with incessant grin, Triples the Double of his chin. Birth, rank, and wealth, have wond'rous skill; Make Wits and Statesmen when they will; While genius holds no estimation, From luckless want of Situation; And, if through clouded scenes of life, He takes dame poverty to wife, Howe'er he work and teize his brain, His pound of wit scarce weighs a grain; While with his Lordship it abounds, And one light grain swells out to pounds. Receive, good sir, with aspect kind, This wanton gallop of the mind; But, since all things encrease in worth, Proportion'd to their rank and birth; Lest you should think the letter base, While I supply the poet's place, I'll tell you whence and what I am, My Breed, my Blood, my Sire, my Dam. My Sire was Pindar's Eagle, son Of Pegasus of Helicon; My Dam, the Hippogryph, which whirl'd Astolpho to the lunar world. Both high-bred things of mettled blood, The best in all Apollo's stud. Now Critics here would bid me speak The old horse language, that is Greek; For Homer made us talk, you know, Almost three thousand years ago; And men of Taste and Judgment fine, Allow the passage is divine. They were fine mettled things indeed, And of peculiar strength and breed; What leaps they took, how far and wide! —They'd take a country at a stride. How great each leap, Longinus knew, Who from dimensions ta'en of two, Affirms, with equal ardour whirld, A third, good lord! would clear the world. But till some learned wight shall shew If Accents must be us'd, or no, A doubt, which puzzles all the wise Of giant and of pigmy size, Who waste their time, and fancies vex With asper, lenis, circumflex, And talk of mark and punctuation, As 'twere a matter of salvation; For when your pigmies take the pen They fancy they grow up to Men, And think they keep the world in awe By brandishing a very Straw. Till they have clear'd this weighty doubt, Which they'll be centuries about, As a plain nag, in homely phrase, I'll use the language of our days; And, for this first and only time, Just make a trot in easy rhime. Nor let it shock your thought or sight, That thus a quadruped should write; Read but the papers, and you'll see More prodigies of wit than me; Grown men and Sparrows taught to dance, By monsieur Passerat from France; The learned dog, the learned mare, The learned bird, the learned hare; And all are fashionable too, And play at cards as well as you. Of paper, pen, and ink posscss'd, With saculties of writing blest, Why should not I then, Hownnyhwm bred (A word that must be seen, not said) Rid you of all that anxious care, Which good folks feel for good and fair, And which your looks betray'd indeed, To more discerning eyes of steed; When in the shape of useful hack, I bore a poet on my back? Know, safely rode my master's bride, The bard before her for my guide. Yet think not, sir, his awkward care Ensur'd protection to the fair. No—conscious of the prize I bore, My wayward footsteps slipt no more. For though I scorn the Poet's skill, My mistress guides me where she will. Abstract in wond'rous speculation, Lost in laborious meditation, As whether 'twould promote Sublime If Silver could be pair'd in rhime; Or, as the word of sweeter Tune, Month might be clink'd instead of moon: No wonder poets hardly know Or what they do, or where they go. Whether they ride or walk the street, Their heads are always on their feet; They now and then may get astride Th' ideal Pegasus, and ride Prodigious journeys—round a room, As boys ride cock-horse on a broom. Whether Acrostics teize the brain, Which goes a hunting words in vain, (For words most capitally sin, Unless their letters right begin.) Since how to man or woman's name, Could you or I Acrostic frame. Or make the staring letters join, To form the word, that tells us thine, Unless we'ad right initials got, S, C, O, T, and so made Scot? Or whether Rebus, Riddle's brother (Both which had Dullness for their mother) Employ the gentle poet's care, To celebrate some town or fair, Which all ad libitum he slits For you to pick it up by bits, Which bits together plac'd, will frame Some city's or some lady's name; As when a worm is cut in twain, It joins and is a worm again; When thoughts so weighty, so intense, Above the reach of common sense, Distract and twirl the mind about, Which fain would hammer something out; A kind discharge relieves the mind, As folks are eas'd by breaking wind; Whatever whims or maggots bred Take place of sense in poet's head, They fix themselves without controul, Where'er its seat is on the soul. Then, like your heathen idols, we Have eyes indeed, but cannot see. (We, for I take the poet's part, And for my blood, am Bard at heart) For in reflection deep immerst, The man muse-bitten and be-verst, Neglectful of externals all, Will run his head against a wall, Walk thro' a river as it flows, Nor see the bridge before his nose. Are things like these equestrians fit To mount the back of mettled tit? Are—but farewell, for here comes Bob, And I must serve some hackney job; Fetch letters, or, for recreation, Transport the bard to our Plantation. Robert joins compts with Burnam Black. Your humble servant Hanbury's hack. THE NEW-RIVER HEAD. A TALE. ATTEMPTED IN THE MANNER OF MR. C. DENIS. INSCRIBED TO JOHN WILKES, ESQ Labitur &amp; labetur in omne volubilis ævum. Hor. Dear Wilkes, whose lively social Wit Disdains the prudish Affectation Of gloomy Folks, who love to sit As Doctors should at Consultation, Permit me, in familiar Strain, To steal you from the idle hour Of combating the Northern Thane, And all his puppet tools of Pow'r. Shame to the Wretch, if sense of shame Can ever touch the miscreant's breast, Who dead to virtue as to fame, (A Monster whom the Gods detest) Turns traitor to himself, to court Or Minister or Monarch's smile; And dares, in insolence of sport, Invade the Charter of our Isle. But why should I, who only strive By telling of an easy tale, To keep attention half alive 'Gainst Bolgolam and Flimnap rail? For whether England be the name, (Name which we're taught no more to prize) Or Britain, it is all the same, The Lilliputian Statesmen rise To malice of gigantic size. Let them enjoy their warmth a while, Truth shall regard them with a smile, While you, like Gulliver, in sport Piss out the fire, and save the Court. But to return—The tale is old; Indecent, truly none of mine— What Beroaldus gravely told; I read it in that sound divine. And for indecency, you know He had a fashionable turn, As prim observers clearly shew In t'other Parson, Doctor Sterne. Yet Pope denies it all defence, And calls it, bless us! Want of sense. But e'en the decent Pope can write Rape of the Lock. Of bottles, corks, and maiden sighs, Of charming beauties less in sight, Of the more secret precious hair, Pope's Letters. “And something else of little Size, You know where.” If such Authorities prevail, To varnish o'er this petty sin, I plead a pardon for my tale, And having hemm'd and cough'd—begin. A Genius (one of those I mean, We read of in th' Arabian nights; Not such as every day are seen At Bob's or Arthur's, whilom White's; For howsoe'er you change the name, The Clubs and Meetings are the same; Nor those prodigious learned solks, Your Haberdashers of stale Jokes, Who dress them up so neat and clean For News-paper or Magazine; But one that could play wond'rous tricks, Changing the very course of Nature, Not Asmodeus on two sticks Or sage Urganda could do greater.) Once on a time incog came down From his equivocal dominions, And travell'd o'er a country town To try folks tempers and opinions. When to accomplish his intent (For had the cobler known the king, Lord! it would quite have spoil'd the thing) In strange disguise he slily went And stump'd along the high-way track, With greasy knapsack at his back; And now the night was pitchy dark, Without one star's indulgent spark, Whether he wanted sleep or not, Is of no consequence to tell; A bed and lodging must be got, For geniuses live always well. At the best house in all the town, (It was th' attorney's you may swear) He knock'd as he'd have beat it down, Knock as you would, no entrance there. But from the window cried the dame, Go, sirrah go, from whence you came. Here, Nell, John, Thomas, see who knocks, Fellow, I'll put you in the stocks. Be gentle ma'm, the Genius cried; Have mercy on the wand'ring poor, Who knows not where his head to hide, And asks a pittance at your door. A mug of beer, a crust of bread— Have pity on the houseless head; Your husband keeps a lordly table, I ask but for the offal crumbs, And for a lodging—barn or stable Will shroud me till the morning comes. 'Twas all in vain; she rang the bell, The servants trembl'd at the knell; Down flew the maids to tell the men, To drive the vagrant back agen. He trudg'd away in angry mind, And thought but cheaply of mankind, Till thro' a casement's dingy pane, A rush-light's melancholy ray, Bad him e'en try his luck again; Perhaps beneath a house of clay A wand'ring passenger might find, A better friend to human kind, And far more hospitable fare, Tho' not so costly, nice, or rare, As smokes upon the silver plate Of the luxurious pamper'd great. So to this cot of homely thatch, In the same plight the genius came: Down comes the dame, lifts up the latch; What want ye sir? God save you, dame. And so he told the piteous tale, Which you have heard him tell before; Your patience and my own would fail Were I to tell it o'er and o'er. Suffice it, that my goody's care Brought forth her best, tho' simple fare, And from the corner-cupboard's hoard, Her stranger guest the more to please, Bespread her hospitable board With what she had—'twas bread and cheese. 'Tis honest tho' but homely cheer; Much good may't do ye, eat your fill, Would I cou'd treat you with strong beer, But for the action take the will, You see my cot is clean, tho' small, Pray heav'n encrease my slender stock! You're welcome, friend, you see my all; And for your bed, Sir, there's a flock. No matter what was after said, He eat and drank and went to bed. And now the cock his mattins sung, (Howe'er such singing's light esteem'd, 'Tis precious in the Muses' tongue When sung rimes better than he scream'd) The dame and pedlar both arose, At early dawn of rising day, She for her work of folding cloaths, And He to travel on his way; But much he thought himself to blame, If, as in duty surely bound, He did not thank the careful dame For the reception he had found. Hostess, quoth He, before I go, I thank you for your hearty Fare; Would it were in my pow'r to pay My gratitude a better way; But money now runs very low, And I have not a doit to spare; But if you'll take this piece of Stusf— —No, quoth the dame, I'm poor as you, Your kindest wishes are enough, You're welcome, friend, farewell—Adieu. But first reply'd the wand'ring guest, For bed and board and homely dish, May all things turn out for the best, So take my blessing and my wish. May what you first begin to do, Create such profit and delight, That you may do it all day through, Nor finish till the depth of night. Thank you, she said, and shut the door, Turn'd to her work, and thought no more. And now the napkin which was spread To treat her guest with good brown bread, She folded up with nicest care; When lo! another napkin there! And every folding did beget Another and another yet. She folds a shift—by strange encrease, The remnant swells into a piece. Her Caps, her Laces, all the same, Till such a quantity of Linen, From such a very small beginning, Flow'd in at once upon the Dame, Who wonder'd how the deuce it came, That with the drap'ry she had got Within her little shabby cot, She might for all the town provide, And break both York-street and Cheapside. It happen'd that th' attorney's wife, Who, to be sure, took much upon her, As being one in higher Life, Who did the Parish mighty honour, Sent for the Dame, who, poor and willing, Would take a job of charing work, And sweat and toil like any Turk, To earn a sixpence or a shilling. She could not come, not she indeed! She thank'd her much, but had no need. Good news will fly as well as bad, So out this wond'rous story came, About the Pedlar and the Dame, Which made th' Attorney's wife so mad, That she resolv'd at any rate, Spite of her pride and Lady airs, To get the Pedlar tâte-à-tête, And make up all the past affairs, And tho' she wish'd him at the devil, When he came there the night before, Determin'd to be monstrous civil, And drop her curtsie at the door. Now all was racket, noise and pother, Nell running one way, John another, And Tom was on the coach-horse sent, To learn which way the Pedlar went. Thomas return'd;—the Pedlar brought. —What could my dainty Madam say, For not behaving as she ought, And driving honest folks away? Upon my word, it shocks me much, —But there's such thieving here of late— Not that I dream'd that you were such, When you came knocking at my gate. I must confess myself to blame, And I'm afraid you lately met Sad treatment with that homely dame, Who lives on what her hands can get. Walk in with me at least to-night, And let us set all matters right. I know my duty, and indeed Would help a friend in time of need. Take such refreshment as you find, I'm sure I mean it for the best, And give it with a willing mind To such a grave and sober guest. So in they came, and for his picking, Behold the table covers spread, Instead of Goody's cheese and bread, With tarts, and fish, and flesh, and chicken. And to appear in greater state, The knives and forks with silver handles, The candlesticks of bright (French) plate To hold her best mould (tallow) candles, Were all brought forth to be display'd, In female housewifry parade. And more the Pedlar to regale, And make the wond'rous man her friend, Decanters foam'd of mantling ale, And port and claret without end; They hobb'd and nobb'd, and smil'd and laugh'd, Touch'd glasses, nam'd their toasts, and quaff'd; Talk'd over every friend and foe, Till eating, drinking, talking past, The kind house-clock struck twelve at last. When wishing Madam bon repos, The Pedlar pleaded weary head, Made his low bow, and went to bed. Wishing him then at perfect ease, A good soft bed, a good sound sleep, Now, gentle reader, if you please, We'll at the Lady take a peep. She could not rest, but turn'd and toss'd, While Fancy whisper'd in her brain, That what her indiscretion lost, Her art and cunning might regain. Such Linen to so poor a dame! For such coarse fair! perplex'd her head, Why might not she expect the same, So courteous, civil, and well-bred? And now she reckon'd up her store Of Cambricks, Hollands, Muslins, Lawns, Free gifts, and Purchases, and Pawns, Resolv'd to multiply them more, Till she had got a Stock of Linen, Fit sor a Dowager to sin in. The morning came, when up she got, Most ceremoniously inclin'd To wind up her sagacious plot, With all that civil stuff we find 'Mongst those who talk a wond'rous deal Of what they neither mean nor feel. How shall I, Ma'm, reply'd the Guest, Make you a suitable return, For your attention and concern, And such civilities exprest To one, who must be still in debt For all the kindness he has met? For this your entertainment's sake, If ought of good my wish can do, May what you first shall undertake, Last without ceasing all day through. Madam, who kindly understood His wish effectually good, Strait dropp'd a curtsie wond'rous low, For much she wanted him to go, That she might look up all her store, And turn it into thousands more. Now all the maids were sent to look In every cranny, hole and nook, For every rag which they could find Of any size, or any kind. Draw'rs, Boxes, Closets, Chests and Cases Were all unlock'd at once to get Her Point, her Gawz, her Prussia-net, With fifty names of fifty kinds, Which suit variety of minds. How shall I now my tale pursue, So passing strange, so passing true? When every bit from every hoard, Was brought and laid upon the board, Lest some more urgent obligation Might interrupt her pleasing toil, And marring half her application, The promis'd hopes of profit spoil, Before she folds a single rag, Or takes a cap from board or bag, That nothing might her work prevent, (For she was now resolv'd to labour, With earnest hope and full intent To get the better of her neighbour) Into the garden she would go To do that necessary thing, Which must by all be done, you know, By rich and poor, and high and low, By Male and Female, Queen and King, She little dream'd a common action, Practis'd as duly as her pray'rs, Should prove so tedious a transaction, Or cost her such a sea of cares. In short the streams so plenteous flow'd, That in the dry and dusty weather, She might have water'd all the road For ten or twenty miles together. What could she do? as it began, Th' involuntary torrent ran. Instead of folding Cap or Mob, So dreadful was this distillation, That from a simple watering job, She fear'd a general Inundation. While for her Indiscretion's crime, And coveting too great a store, She made a river at a time, Which sure was never done before. A FAMILIAR LETTER OF RHIMES TO A LADY. Yes—I could rifle grove and bow'r And strip the beds of every flow'r, And deck them in their fairest hue, Merely to be out-blush'd by you. The lily pale, by my direction, Should fight the rose for your complexion; Or I could make up sweetest posies, Fit fragrance for the ladies' noses, Which drooping, on your breast reclining, Should all be withering, dying, pining, Which every songster can display, I've more authorities than Gay; Nay, I could teach the globe its duty To pay all homage to your beauty, And, wit's creative pow'r to show, The very fire should mix with snow; Your eyes, that brandish burning darts To scorch and singe our tinder hearts, Should be the lamps for lover's ruin, And light them to their own undoing; While all the snow about your breast Should leave them hopeless and distrest. For those who rarely soar above The art of coupling love and dove, In their conceits and amorous fictions, Are mighty fond of contradictions, Above, in air; in earth, beneath; And things that do, or do not breathe, All have their parts, and separate place, To paint the fair one's various grace. Her cheek, her eye, her bosom show The rose, the lily, diamond, snow. Jet, milk, and amber, vales and mountains, Stars, rubies, suns, and mossy fountains, The poet gives them all a share In the description of his fair. She burns, she chills, she pierces hearts, With locks, and bolts, and flames, and darts. And could we trust th' extravagancy Of every poet's youthful fancy, They'd make each nymph they love so well, As cold as snow, as hot as—— —O gentle lady, spare your fright, No horrid rhime shall wound your sight. I would not for the world be heard, To utter such unseemly word, Which the politer parson fears To mention to politer ears. But, could a female form be shown, (The thought, perhaps, is not my own) Where every circumstance should meet To make the poet's nymph compleat Form'd to his fancy's utmost pitch, She'd be as ugly as a witch. Come then, O muse, of trim conceit, Muse, always fine, but never neat, Who to the dull unsated ear Of French or Tuscan Sonneteer, Tak'st up the same unvaried tone, Like the Scotch bagpipe's favourite drone, Squeezing out thoughts in ditties quaint, To poet's mistress, whore, or saint; Whether thou dwell'st on ev'ry grace, Which lights the world from Laura's sace, Or amorous praise expatiates wide On beauties which the nymph must hide; For wit affected, loves to show Her every charm from top to toe, And wanton fancy oft pursues Minute description from the muse, Come and pourtray, with pencil fine, The poet's mortal nymph divine. Her golden locks of classic hair, Are nets to catch the wanton air; Her forehead ivory, and her eyes Each a bright sun to light the skies, Orb'd in whose centre, Cupid aims His darts, protect us! tipt with flames; While the sly god's unerring bow Is the half circle of her brow. Each lip a ruby, parting, shews The precious pearl in even rows, And all the loves and graces sleek Bathe in the dimples of her cheek. Her breasts pure snow, or white as milk, Are ivory apples, smooth as silk, Or else, as fancy trips on faster, Fine marble hills or alabaster. A figure made of wax wou'd please More than an aggregate of these, Which though they are of precious worth, And held in great esteem on earth, What are they, rightly understood, Compar'd to real flesh and blood? And I, who hate to act by rules Of whining, rhiming, loving fools, Can never twist my mind about To find such strange resemblance out, And simile that's only fit To shew my plenteous lack of wit. Therefore, omitting flames and darts, Wounds, sighs and tears, and bleeding hearts, Obeying, what I here declare, Makes half my happiness, the Fair, The favourite subject I pursue, And write, as who would not, for you. Perhaps my muse, a common curse, Errs in the manner of her verse, Which, slouching in the doggrel lay, Goes tittup all her easy way. Yes—an Acrostic had been better, Where each good-natured prattling letter, Though it conceal the writer's aim, Tells all the world his lady's name. But all Acrostics, it is said, Shew wond'rous pain of empty head, Where wit is cramp'd in hard confines, And fancy dare not jump the lines. I love a fanciful disorder, And straggling out of rule and order; Impute not then to vacant head, Or what I've writ, or what I've said, Which imputation can't be true, Where head and heart's so full of you. Like Tristram Shandy, I could write From morn to noon, from noon to night, Sometimes obscure, and sometimes leaning A little sideways to a meaning, And unfatigu'd myself, pursue The civil mode of teazing you. For as your folks who love the dwelling On circumstance in story telling, And to give each relation grace, Describe the time, the folks, the place, And are religiously exact To point out each unmeaning fact, Repeat their wonders undesired, Nor think one hearer can be tired; So they who take a method worse, And prose away, like me, in verse, Worry their mistress, friends or betters, With satire, sonnet, ode, or letters, And think the knack of pleasing follows Each jingling pupil of Apollo's. —Yet let it be a venial crime That I address you thus in rhime. Nor think that I am Phœbus' bit By the Tarantula of wit, But as the meanest critic knows All females have a knack at prose, And letters are the mode of writing The ladies take the most delight in; Bold is the man, whose saucy aim Leads him to form a rival claim; A double death the victim dies, Wounded by wit as well as eyes. —With mine disgrace a lady's prose, And put a nettle next a rose? Who would so long as taste prevails, Compare St. James's with Versailles? The nightingale, as story goes, Fam'd for the music of his woes, In vain against the artist try'd, But strain'd his tuneful throat—and died. Perhaps I sought the rhiming way, For reasons which have pow'rful sway. The swain, no doubt, with pleasure sues The nymph he's sure will not refuse, And more compassion may be found Amongst these goddesses of sound, Than always happens to the share Of the more cruel human fair; Who love to fix their lover's pains, Pleas'd with the rattling of their chains, Rejoicing in their servant's grief, As 'twere a sin to give relief. They twist each easy fool about, Nor let them in, nor let them out, But keep them twirling on the fire Of apprehension and desire, As cock-chafers, with corking pin The school-boy stabs, to make them spin. For 'tis a maxim in love's school, To make a man of sense a fool; I mean the man, who loves indeed, And hopes and wishes to succeed; But from his fear and apprehension, Which always mars his best intention, Can ne'er address with proper ease The very person he would please. Now poets, when these nymphs refuse, Strait go a courting to the muse. But still some difference we find 'Twixt goddesses and human kind; The muses' favours are ideal, The ladies' scarce, but always real. The poet can, with little pain, Create a mistress in his brain, Heap each attraction, every grace That should adorn the mind or face, On Delia, Phyllis, with a score Of Phyllisses and Delias more. Or as the whim of passion burns, Can court each frolic muse by turns; Nor shall one word of blame be said, Altho' he take them all to bed. The muse detests coquettry's guilt, Nor apes the manners of a jilt. Jilt! O dishonest hatesul name, Your sex's pride, your sex's shame, Which often bait their treacherous hook With smile endearing, winning look, And wind them in the easy heart Of man, with most ensnaring art, Only to torture and betray The wretch they mean to cast away. No doubt 'tis charming pleasant angling To see the poor fond creatures dangling, Who rush like gudgeons to the bait, And gorge the mischief they should hate. Yet sure such cruelties deface Your virtues of their fairest grace. And pity, which in woman's breast, Should swim at top of all the rest, Must such insidious sport condemn, Which play to you, is death to them. So have I often read or heard, Though both upon a trav'llers word, (Authority may pass it down, So, vide Travels, by Ed. Brown) At Metz, a dreadful engine stands, Form'd like a maid, with folded hands, Which finely drest, with primmest grace, Rcceives the culprit's sirst embrace; But at the second (dismal wonder!) Unfolds, clasps, cuts his heart asunder. You'll say, perhaps, I love to rail, We'll end the matter with a tale. A Robin once, who lov'd to stray, And hop about from spray to spray, Familiar as the folks were kind, Nor thought of mischief in his mind, Slight favours make the bold presume, Would flutter round the lady's room, And careless often take his stand Upon the lovely Flavia's hand. The nymph, 'tis said, his freedom sought, —In short, the trifling fool was caught; And happy in the fair one's grace, Would not accept an Eagle's place. And while the nymph was kind as fair, Wish'd not to gain his native air. But thought he bargain'd to his cost, To gain the liberty he lost. Till at the last, a fop was seen, A parrot, dress'd in red and green, Who could not boast one genuine note, But chatter'd, swore and ly'd—by rote. “Nonsense and noise will oft prevail, “When honour and affection fail.” The lady lik'd her foreign guest, For novelty will please the best; And whether it is lace or fan, Or silk, or china, bird or man, None sure can think it wrong, or strange, That ladies should admire a change. The Parrot now came into play, The Robin! he had had his day, But could not brook the nymph's disdain, So fled—and ne'er came back again. THE COBLER OF TISSINGTON'S LETTER TO DAVID GARRICK, ESQ. 1761. My predecessors often use To coble verse as well as shoes; As Partridge (vide Swift's disputes) Who turned Bootes into boots, Ah!—Partridge!—I'll be bold to say Was a rare scholar in his day; He'd tell you when t'wou'd rain, and when The weather would be fine agen; Precisely when your bones should ache, And when grow sound, by th' almanack. For he knew ev'ry thing, d'ye see, By what d'ye call't, astrology, And skill'd in all the starry system, Foretold events, and often mist'em. And then it griev'd me sore to look Just at the heel-piece of his book, Where stood a man, Lord bless my heart! (No doubt by matthew maticks art,) Naked, expos'd to public view, And darts stuck in him through and through. I warrant him some hardy fool, Who scorn'd to follow wisdom's rule, And dar'd blasphemously despise Our doctor's knowledge in the skies. Full dearly he abides his laugh, I'm sure 'tis Swift, or Bickerstaff. Excuse this bit of a digression, A cobler's is a learn'd profession. Why may not I too couple rhimes? My wit will not disgrace the times; I too, forsooth, among the rest, Claim one advantage, and the best, I scarce know writing, have no reading, Nor any kind of scholar breeding; And wanting that's the sole foundation Of half your poets' reputation. While genius, perfect at its birth, Springs up, like mushrooms from the earth. You know they send me to and fro To carry messages or so; And tho' I'm somewhat old and crazy, I'm still of service to the lazy. For our good squire has no great notion Of much alacrity in motion, And when there's miles betwixt, you know Would rather send by half, than go; Then I'm dispatch'd to travel hard, And bear myself by way of card. I'm a two-legg'd excuse to show Why other people cannot go; And merit sure I must assume, For once I went in Garrick's room. In my old age, 'twere wond'rous hard To come to town, as trav'lling card, Then let the post convey me there, The clerk's direction tell him where, For, tho' I ramble at this rate He writes it all, and I dictate; For I'm resolv'd—by help of neighbour, (Who keeps a school, and goes to labour) To tell you all things as they past; Coblers will go beyond their last, And so I'm told will authors too, —But that's a point I leave to you; Cobling extends a thousand ways, Some coble shoes, some coble plays; Some—but this jingle's vastly clever, It makes a body write for ever. While with the motion of the pen, Method pops in and out agen, So, as I said, I thought it better, To set me down and think a letter, And without any more ado, Seal up my mind, and send it you. You'll ask me, master, why I chuse To plague your worship with my muse? I'll tell you then—will truth offend? Tho' cobler, yet I love my friend. Besides, I like you merry folks, Who make their puns, and crack their jokes; Your jovial hearts are never wrong, I love a story, or a song; But always feel most grievous qualms, From Westley's hymns, or Wisdom's psalms. My father often told me, one day Was for religion—that was Sunday, When I should go to prayers twice, And hear our parson battle vice; And dress'd in all my finest cloaths, Twang the psalmoddy thro' my nose. But betwixt churches, for relief, Eat bak'd plumb-pudding, and roast-beef; And chearful, without sin, regale With good home-brew'd, and nappy ale, But not one word of fasting greetings, And dry religious singing meetings. But here comes folks a-preaching to us A saving doctrine to undo us, Whose notions fanciful and scurvy, Turn old religion topsy-turvy. I'll give my pleasure up for no man, And an't I right now, master Show-man? You seem'd to me a person civil, Our parson gives you to the devil; And says, as how, that after grace, You laugh'd directly in his face; Ay, laugh'd out-right (as I'm a sinner) I should have lik'd t' have been at dinner, Not for the sake of master's fare, But to have seen the doctor stare. Odzooks, I think, he's perfect mad, Scar'd out of all the wits he had, For wheresoe'er the doctor comes, He pulls his wig, and bites his thumbs, And mutters, in a broken rage, The Minor, Garrick, Foote, the Stage; (For I must blab it out—but hist, His reverence is a methodist) And preaches like an errant fury, 'Gainst all your show folks about Drury, Says actors all are hellish imps, And managers the devil's pimps. He knows not what he sets about; Puts on his surplice inside out, Mistakes the lessons in the church, Or leaves a collect in the lurch; And t'other day—God help his head, The gard'ner's wife being brought to bed, When sent for to baptize the child His wig awry, and staring wild, He laid the prayer-book flat before him, And read the burial service o'er him. —The folks must wait without their shoes, For I must tell you all the news. For we have had a deal to do, Our squire's become a show-man too! And horse and foot arrive in flocks, To see his worship's famous rocks, Whilst, he with humorous delight, Walks all about and shews the sight, Points out the place, where trembling you Had like t' have bid the world adieu; It bears the sad remembrance still, And people call it Garrick's Hill. The goats their usual distance keep, We never have recourse to sheep; And the whole scene wants nothing now, Except your ferry-boat and cow. I had a great deal more to say, But I am sent express away, To setch the squire's three children down To Tissington from Derby town; And Allen says he'll mend my rhime, When e'er I write a second time. THE COBLER OF CRIPPLEGATE'S LETTER TO ROBERT LLOYD, A. M. Unus'd to verse, and tir'd, Heav'n knows, Of drudging on in heavy prose, Day after day, year after year, Which I have sent the Gazetteer; Now, for the first time, I essay To write in your own easy way. And now, O Lloyd, I wish I had, To go that road your ambling pad, While you, with all a poet's pride, On the great horse of verse might ride. You leave the road that's rough and stoney, To pace and whistle with your poney; Sad proof to us you're lazy grown, And fear to gall your huckle-bone. For he who rides a nag so small, Will soon, we fear, ride none at all. There are, and nought gives more offence, Who have some fav'rite excellence, Which evermore they introduce, And bring it into constant use. Thus Garrick still in ev'ry part Has pause, and attitude, and start: The pause, I will allow, is good, And so, perhaps, the attitude; The start too's fine: but if not scarce, The tragedy becomes a farce. I have too, pardon me, some quarrel, With other branches of your laurel. I hate the stile, that still defends Yourself, or praises all your friends, As if the club of wits was met To make eulogiums on the Set; Say, must the town for ever hear, And no Reviewer dare to sneer, Of Thornton's humour, Garrick's nature, And Colman's wit, and Churchill's satire? Churchill, who—let it not offend, If I make free, tho' he's your friend, And sure we cannot want excuse, When Churchill's nam'd, for smart abuse— Churchill! who ever loves to raise On slander's dung his mushroom bays: The priest, I grant, has something clever, A something that will last for ever. Let him, in part, be made your pattern, Whose muse, now queen, and now a slattern, Trick'd out in Rosciad rules the roast, Turns trapes and trollop in the Ghost, By turns both tickles us, and warms, And, drunk or sober, has her charms. Garrick, to whom with lath and plaister You try to raise a fine pilaster, And found on Lear and Macbeth, His monument e'en after death, Garrick's a dealer in grimaces, A haberdasher of wry faces, A hypocrite, in all his stages, Who laughs and cries for hire and wages; As undertakers' men draw grief From onion in their handkerchief, Like real mourners cry and sob, And of their passions make a job. And Colman too, that little sinner, That essay-weaver, drama-spinner, Too much the comic Sock will use, For 'tis the law must find him Shoes. And tho' he thinks on fame's wide ocean He swims, and has a pretty motion, Inform him, Lloyd, for all his grin That Harry Fielding holds his chin. Now higher soar, my muse, and higher, To Bonnel Thornton, hight Esquire! The only man to make us laugh, A very Peter Paragraph; The grand conducter and adviser In Chronicle, and Advertiser, Who still delights to run his rig On Citizen and Periwig! Good sense, I know, tho' dash'd with oddity, In Thornton is no scarce commodity: Much learning too I can descry, Beneath his periwig doth lie.— —I beg his pardon, I declare, His grizzle's gone for greasy hair, Which now the wag with ease can scrue, With dirty ribband in a queue— But why neglect (his trade forsaking For scribbling, and for merry-making,) With tye to overshade that brain, Which might have shone in Warwick-Lane? Why not, with spectacles on nose, In chariot lazily repose, A formal, pompous, deep physician, Himself a Sign-post exhibition? But hold, my Muse! you run a-head: And where's the clue that shall unthread The maze, wherein you are entangled? While out of tune the bells are jangled Thro' rhimes rough road that serve to deck My jaded Pegasus his neck. My muse with Lloyd alone contends: Why then fall foul upon his friends? Unless to shew, like handy-dandy, Or Churchill's Ghost, or Tristram Shandy, Now here, now there, with quick progression, How smartly you can make digression: Your rambling spirit now confine, And speak to Lloyd in ev'ry line. Tell me then, Lloyd, what is't you mean By cobbling up a Magazine? A Magazine, a wretched Olio Purloin'd from quarto and from folio, From Pamphlet, News-paper, and Book; Which tost up by a monthly cook, Borrows fine shapes, and titles new, Of fricasee and rich ragoût, Which dunces dress, as well as you. Say, is't for you, your wit to coop, And tumble thro' this narrow hoop? The body thrives, and so the mind, When both are free and unconfin'd; But harness'd in like hackney tit, To run the monthly stage of wit, The racer stumbles in the shaft, And shews he was not meant for draft. Pot-bellied gluttons, slaves of taste, Who bind in leathern belt their waist, Who lick their lips at ham or haunch, But hate to see the strutting paunch, Full often rue the pain that's felt From circumscription of the belt. Thus women too we ideots call, Who lace their shapes too close and small. Tight stays, they find, oft end in humps, And take, too late, alas! to jumps. The Chinese ladies cramp their seet, Which seem, indeed, both small and neat, While the dear creatures laugh and talk, And can do ev'ry thing—but walk; Thus you, “who trip it as you go On the light fantastic toe,” And in the Ring are ever seen, Or Rotten-Row of Magazine, Will cramp your muse in four-foot verse, And find at last your ease your curse. Cllo already humbly begs You'd give her leave to stretch her legs, For tho' sometimes she takes a leap, Yet quadrupeds can only creep. While Namby-Pamby thus you scribble, Your manly genius a mere fribble, Pinn'd down, and sickly, cannot vapour, Nor dares to spring, or cut a caper. Rouse then, for shame, your ancient spirit! Write a great work! a work of merit! The conduct of your friend examine, And give a Prophecy of Famine; Or like yourself, in days of yore, Write Actors, as you did before: Write what may pow'rful friends create you, And make your present friends all hate you. Learn not a shuffling, shambling, pace, But go erect with manly grace; For Ovid says, and pr'ythee heed it, Os homini sublime dedit. But if you still waste all your prime In spinning Lilliputian rhyme, Too long your genius will lie fallow, And Robert Lloyd be Robert Shallow. ON RHYME. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND. Bring paper, Ash, and let me send My hearty service to my friend. How pure the paper looks and white! What pity 'tis that folks will write, And on the face of candour scrawl With desperate ink, and heart of gall! Yet thus it often fares with those Who, gay and easy in their prose, Incur ill-nature's ugly crime, And lay about 'em in their rhyme. No man more generous, frank and kind, Of more ingenuous social mind, Than Churchill, yet tho' Churchill hear, I will pronounce him too severe, For, whether scribbled at or not, He writes no name without a blot. Yet let me urge one honest plea, Say, is the Muse in fault or He? The man, whose genius thirsts for praise, Who boldly plucks, not waits the bays; Who drives his rapid car along, And feels the energy of song; Writes, from the impulse of the Muse, What sober reason might refuse. My Lord, who lives and writes at ease, (Sure to be pleas'd, as sure to please) And draws from silver-stand his pen, To scribble sonnets now and then; Who writes not what he truly feels, But rather what he slily steals, And patches up, in courtly phrase, The manly sense of better days; Whose dainty Muse is only kist; But as his dainty Lordship list, Who treats her like a Mistress still, To turn her off, and keep at will; Knows not the labour, pains, and strife, Of him who takes the Muse to Wife. For then the poor good-natur'd man Must bear his burden as he can; And if my lady prove a shrew, What would you have the husband do? Say, should he thwart her inclination To work his own, and her vexation? Or, giving madam all her rein, Make marriage but a silken chain? Thus we, who lead poetic lives, The hen-peck'd culls of vixen wives, Receive their orders, and obey, Like husbands in the common way: And when we write with too much phlegm, The fault is not in us, but them: True servants always at command, We hold the pen, they guide the hand. Why need I urge so plain a fact To you who catch me in the act? And see me, (ere I've said my grace, That is, put Sir in proper place, Or with epistolary bow, Have prefac'd, as I scarce know how.) You see me, as I said before, Run up and down a page or more, Without one word of tribute due To friendship's altar, and to you. Accept, then, in or out of time, My honest thanks, tho' writ in rhyme. And these once paid (to obligations Repeated thanks grow stale vexations, And hurt the liberal donor more Than all his lavish gifts before) I skip about, as whim prevails, Like your own frisky goats in Wales, And follow where the Muse shall lead, O'er hedge and ditch, o'er hill or mead. Well might the Shaftsbury. Lordly writer praise The first inventor of Essays, Where wanton fancy gaily rambles, Walks, paces, gallops, trots, and ambles; And all things may be sung or said, While drowsy Method's gone to bed. And blest the poet, or the rhymist, (For surely none of the sublimest) Who prancing in his easy mode, Down this epistolary road; First taught the Muse to play the fool, A truant from the pedant's school, And skipping, like a tasteless dunce, O'er all the Unities at once; (For so we keep but clink and rhyme, A fig for Action, Place, and Time.) But critics (who still judge by rules, Transmitted down as guides to fools, And howsoe'er they prate about 'em, Drawn from wise folks who writ without 'em) Will blame this frolic, wild excursion, Which fancy takes for her diversion, As inconsistent with the law, Which keeps the sober Muse in awe, Who dares not for her life dispense, With such mechanic chains for sense. Yet men are often apt to blame Those errors they'd be proud to claim, And if their skill, of pigmy size, To glorious darings cannot rise, From critic spleen and pedant phlegm, Would make all genius creep with them. Nay, e'en professors of the art, To prove their wit betray their heart, And speak against themselves, to show, What they would hate the world shou'd know. As when the measur'd couplets curse, The manacles of Gothic verse, While the trim bard in easy strains, Talks much of fetters, clogs, and chains; He only aims that you should think, How charmingly he makes them clink. So have I seen in tragic stride, The hero of the Mourning Bride, Sullen and sulky tread the stage, Till, fixt attention to engage, He flings his fetter'd arms about, That all may find Alphonso out. Oft have I heard it said by those, Who most shou'd blush to be her foes, That rhyme's impertinent vexation, Shackles the brave imagination, Which longs with eager zeal to try Her trackless path above the sky, But that the clog upon her feet, Restrains her flight, and damps her heat. From Boileau down to his translators, Dull paraphrasts, and imitators, All rail at metre at the time They write and owe their sense to rhyme. Had he so maul'd his gentle foe, But for that lucky word Quineaut? Or had his strokes been half so fine, Without that closing name Cotin? Yet dares He on this very theme, His own Apollo to blaspheme, And talk of wars 'twixt rhyme and sense, And murders which ensu'd from thence, As if they both resolv'd to meet, Like Theban sons, in mutual heat, Forgetful of the ties of brother, To maim and massacre each other. 'Tis true, sometimes to costive brains, A couplet costs exceeding pains; But where the fancy waits the skill Of fluent easy dress at will, The thoughts are oft, like colts which stray From fertile meads, and lose their way, Clapt up and fasten'd in the pound Of measur'd rhyme, and barren sound. —What are these jarring notes I hear, Grating harsh discord on my ear! How shrill, how coarse, th' unsettl'd tone, Alternate 'twixt a squeak and drone, Worse than the scrannel pipe of straw, Or music grinding on a saw! Will none that horrid fiddle break? —O spare it for Giardini's sake. 'Tis His, and only errs by chance, Play'd by the hand of ignorance. From this allusion I infer, 'Tis not the art, but artists err, And rhyme's a fiddle, sweet indeed, When touch'd by those who well can lead, Whose varied notes harmonious flow, In tones prolong'd from sweeping bow; But harsh the sounds to ear and mind, From the poor fidler lame and blind, Who begs in music at your door, And thrums Jack Latin o'er and o'er. Some Milton-mad (an affectation Glean'd up from college education) Approve no verse, but that which flows In epithetic measur'd prose, With trim expressions gaily drest Stol'n, misapply'd, and not confest, And call it writing in the stile Of that great Homer of our isle. Whilom, what time, eftoons and erst, (So prose is oftentimes beverst) Sprinkled with quaint fantastic phrase, Uncouth to ears of modern days, Make up the metre, which they call Blank, classick blank, their All in All. Can only blank admit sublime? Go, read and measure Dryden's rhyme. Admire the magic of his song, See how his numbers roll along, With ease and strength and varied pause, Nor cramp'd by sound, nor metre's laws. Is harmony the gift of rhyme? Read, if you can, your Milton's chime; Where taste, not wantonly severe, May find the measure, not the ear. As rhyme, rich rhyme, was Dryien's choice, And blank has Milton's nobler voice, I deem it as the subjects lead, That either measure will succeed. That rhyme will readily admit Of fancy, numbers, force and wit; But tho' each couplet has its strength, It palls in works of epic length. For who can bear to read or hear, Tho' not offensive to the ear, The mighty Blackmore gravely sing Of Arthur Prince, and Arthur King, Heroic poems without number, Long, lifeless, leaden, lulling lumber; Nor pity such laborious toil, And loss of midnight time and oil? Yet glibly runs each jingling line, Smoother, perhaps, than yours or mine, But still, (tho' peace be to the dead,) The dull, dull poems weigh down lead. So have I seen upon the road, A waggon of a mountain's load, Broad-wheel'd, and drawn by horses eight, Pair'd like great folks who strut in state: While the gay steeds, as proud as strong, Drag the slow tottering weight along, Each as the steep ascent he climbs, Moves to his bells, and walks in chimes. The Muses dwelt on Ovid's tongue, For Ovid never said, but sung, And Pope (for Pope affects the same) In numbers lisp'd, for numbers came. Thus, in historic page I've read Of some queen's daughter, fairy-bred, Who could not either cough or spit, Without some precious slow of wit, While her fair lips were as a spout, To tumble pearls and diamonds out. Yet, tho' dame nature may bestow This knack of verse, and jingling flow: (And thousands have that impulse felt, With whom the Muses never dwelt) Tho' it may save the lab'ring brain From many a thought-perplexing pain, And while the rhyme presents itself, Leaves Bysshe untouch'd upon the shelf; Yet more demands the critic ear, Than the two catch-words in the rear, Which stand like watchmen in the close, To keep the verse from being prose. But when reflexion has refin'd This boist'rous bias of the mind, When harmony enriches sense, And borrows stronger charms from thence, When genius steers by judgment's laws, When proper cadence, varied pause Shew nature's strength combin'd with art, And thro' the ear possess the heart; Then numbers come, and all before Is bab, dab, scab—mere rhymes—no more. Some boast, which none could e'er impart, A secret principle of art, Which gives a melody to rhyme Unknown to Bards in antient time. And Boileau leaves it as a rule To all who enter Phoebus' school, To make the metre strong and fine, Poets write first your second line. 'Tis folly all—No poet flows In tuneful verse, who thinks in prose; And all the mighty secret here Lies in the niceness of the ear. E'en in this measure, when the muse, With genuine ease, her way pursues, Tho' she affect to hide her skill, And walks the town in deshabille, Something peculiar will be seen Of air, or grace, in shape or mien, Which will, tho' carelesly display'd, Distinguish Madam from her maid. Here, by the way of critic sample, I give the precept and example. Four feet, you know, in ev'ry line Is Prior's measure, and is mine; Yet Taste wou'd ne'er forgive the crime To talk of mine with Prior's rhyme. Yet, take it on a Poet's word, There are who foolishly have err'd, And marr'd their proper reputation, By sticking close to imitation. A double rhyme is often sought At strange expence of time and thought; And tho' sometimes a lucky hit May give a zest to Butler's wit; Whatever makes the measure halt Is beauty seldom, oft a fault. For when we see the wit and pains, The twisting of the stubborn brains, To cramp the sense within the bound Of some queer double treble sound. Hard is the Muse's travail, and 'tis plain 'Tis pinion'd sense, and Ease in Pain; 'Tis like a foot that's wrapt about With flannel in the racking gout. But here, methinks, 'tis more than time To wave both simile and rhyme; For while, as pen and Muses please, I talk so much of ease and ease, Tho' the words mention'd o'er and o'er, I scarce have thought of yours before. 'Tis true, when writing to one's friend, 'Tis a rare science when to end, As 'tis with wits a common sin To want th' attention to begin. So, Sir, (at last indeed) adieu, Believe me, as you'll find me, true; And if henceforth, at any time, Apollo whispers you in rhyme, Or Lady Fancy should dispose Your mind to sally out in prose, I shall receive, with hallow'd awe, The Muse's mail from Flexney's draw. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE. TO A FRIEND WHO SENT THE AUTHOR A HAMPER OF WINE. Decipit Exemplar vitiis imitabile. Hor. Fond of the loose familiar vein, Which neither tires, nor cracks the brain, The Muse is rather truant grown To buckram works of higher tone; And tho' perhaps her pow'rs of rhyme, Might rise to fancies more sublime, Prefers this easy down-hill road, To dangerous leaps at five-barr'd Ode, Or starting in the Classic race Jack-booted for an Epic chace. That Bard, as other Bards, divine, Who was a sacris to the Nine, Dan Prior I mean, with natural ease, (For what's not nature cannot please) Would sometimes make his rhyming bow, And greet his friend as I do now; And, howsoe'er the critic train May hold my judgment rather vain, Allow me one resemblance true, I have my friend, a Sheperd too. You know, dear Sir, the Muses nine, Tho' sober Maids are wooed in wine, And therefore, as beyond a doubt, You've found my dangling foible out, Send me nectareous Inspiration, Tho' others read Intoxication. For there are those who vainly use This grand Elixir of the Muse, And fancy in their apish fit, And idle trick of maudlin wit, Their genius takes a daring flight, 'Bove Pindus, or Plinlimmon's height. Whilst more of madman than of poet, They're drunk indeed, and do not know it. The Bard, whose charming measure flows With all the native ease of prose, Who, without flashy vain pretence, Has best adorn'd Eternal Sense, And, in his chearful moral page, Speaks to mankind in every age; Tells us, from folks whose situation Makes them the mark of observation, Example oft gives Folly rise, And Imitation clings to Vice. Ennius could never write, 'tis said, Without a bottle in his head; And your own Horace quaff'd his wine In plenteous draughts at Bacchus' shrine; Nay, Addison would oft unbend, T'indulge his genius, with a friend; (For fancy, which is often dry, Must wet her wings, or cannot fly) What precedents for fools to follow Are Ben, the Devil and Apollo! While the great gawky Admiration, Parent of stupid Imitation, Intrinsic proper worth neglects, And copies Errors and Defects. The man, secure in strength of Parts, Has no recourse to shuffling Arts, Seeks not his nature to disguise, Nor heeds the people's tongues, or eyes, His wit, his faults at once displays, Careless of envy, or of praise; And soibles, which we often find Just on the suface of the mind, Strike common eyes, which can't discern What to avoid, and what to learn. Errors in wit conspicuous grow, To use Gay's words, like specks in snow; Yet it were kind, at least, to make Allowance for the merit's sake; And when such beauties fill the eye, To let the blemishes go by. Plague on your philosophic sots! I'll view the sun without its spots. Wits are peculiar in their mode; They cannot bear the hackney road And will contract habitual ways, Which sober people cannot praise, And fools admire: Such fools I hate; —Begone, ye slaves, who imitate. Poor Spurius! eager to destroy And murder hours he can't enjoy, The last of witlings, next to dunce, Would fain turn Genius all at once, But that the wretch mistakes his aim, And thinks a Libertine the same. Connected as the hand and glove, Is Madam Poetry and Love. Shall not He then possess his Muse, And fetch Corinna from the stews, The burthen of his amorous verse, And charming melter of his purse, While happy Rebus tells the name Of His and Drury's common Flame? How will the wretch at Bacchus' shrine, Betray the cause of wit and wine, And waste in bawdy, port, and pun, In taste a very Goth or Hun, Those little bours, of value more Than all the round of time before; When fancy brightens with the flask, And the heart speaks without a mask? Must Thou, whose genius, dull and cool, Is muddy as the stagnant pool; Whose torpid soul and sluggish brains, Dullness pervades, and Wine disdains; Must Tbou to nightly taverns run, Apollo's guest, and Jonson's son? And in thy folly's beastly fit, Attempt the sallies of a wit? Art thou the child of Phoebus' choir? Think of the Adage—Ass and Lyre Asinus ad Lyram If thou wouldst really succeed, And be a mimic wit indeed, Let Dryden lend thee Sheffield's blows, Or like Will. Davenant lose your nose. O Lucian, Sire of antient wit, Who wedding, Humour, didst beget Those doctors in the laughing school, Those Giant sons of Ridicule, Swift, Rab'lais, and The late inimitable Henry Fielding, Efq. that favourite Child, Who, less excentrically wild, Inverts the misanthropic Plan, And hating vices, hates not Man: How do I love thy gibing vein! Which glances at the mimic train Of sots, who proud as modern beaus Of birth-day suits, and tinsel cloaths, Affecting cynical grimace With philosophic stupid face, In dirty hue, with naked seet, In rags and tatters, strole the street, Ostensively exceeding wise; But Knaves, and Fools, and walking Lies, External Mimicry their plan, The monkey's copy after Man. Wits too possess this affectation, And live a life of imitation, Are Slovens, Revellers and Brutes, Laborious, absent, prattlers, Mutes, From some example handed down Of some great Genius of Renown. If Addison, from habit's trick, Could bite his fingers to the quick, Shall not I nibble from design, And be an Addison to mine? If Pope most feelingly complains Of aching head, and throbbing pains. My head and arm his posture hit, And I already acbe for wit. If Churchill, following nature's call, Has bead tbat never acbes at all, With burning brow, and heavy eye, I'll give my looks and pain the Lye. If huge tall words of termination, Which ask a Critic's explanation, Come rolling out along with thought, And seem to stand just where they ought; If language more in grammar drest, With greater emphasis exprest, Unstudied, unaffected flows, In some great Wit's conversing prose; If from the tongue the period round Fall into style, and swell to sound, 'Tis nature which herself displays, And Johnson speaks a Johnson's phrase. But can you hear, without a smile, The formal coxcomb ape his style, Who, most dogmatically wise, Attempts to censure, and despise, Affecting what he cannot reach, A trim propriety of speech? What tho' his pompous Language wear The grand decisive solemn Air, Where quaint Antithesis prevails, And Sentences are weighed in scales, Can you bow down with reverend awe Before this puppet king of straw? Or hush'd in mute attention sit, To hear this Critic, Poet, Wit, Philosopher, all, all at once, And to compleat them all, this—Dunce? —All this you'll say is mighty fine, But what has this to do with Wine? Have patience and the Muse shall tell What you, my friend, know full as well. Vices in Poets, Wits and Kings, Are catching imitable things; And frailties standing out to view, Become the objects fools pursue. Thus have I pictures often seen, Where features neither speak nor mean, Yet spite of all the Face will strike, And mads us that it should be like, When all the near resemblance grows, From scratch or pimple on the Nose. To Poets then (I mean not here The scribling Drudge, or scribling Peer, Nor those who have the monthly fit, The Lunatics of modern Wit) To Poets Wine is inspiration, Blockheads get drunk in lmitation. As different Liquors different ways Affect the body, sometimes raise The fancy to an Eagle's flight, And make the heart feel wondrous light; At other times the circling mug, Like Lethe's draught, or opiate drug, Will strike the senses on a heap, When Folks talk wise, who talk asleep; A whimsical imagination, Might form a whimsical relation, How every Author writes and thinks Analagous to what he drinks, While quaint Conjecture's lucky hit, Finds out his bev'rage in his Wit. Ye goodly dray-nymph Muses, hail! Mum, Porter, Stingo, Mild and Stale, And chiefly thou of boasted fame, Of Roman and Imperial name. O Purl! all hail! thy vot'ry steals, His stockings dangling at his heels, To where some pendent head invites The Bard to set his own to rights, Who seeks thy influence divine, And pours libations on thy shrine, In wormwood draughts of inspiration, To whet his soul for defamation. Hail too, your Domes! whose Masters skill, Takes up illustrious folks at will, And careless or of place or name, Bebeads and bangs to public fame Fine garter'd Knights, blue, red, or green, Lords, Earls and Dukes, nay King, or Queen, And sometimes pairs them both together, To dangle to the wind and weather; Or claps some mighty General there, Who has not any head to spare. Or if it more his fancy suit, Pourtrays or fish, or bird, or brute, And lures the gaping, thirsty guest, To Scott's entire, or Trueman's best. Ye cbequer'd Domes thrice hail! for hence The fire of Wit, the froth of Sense, Here gentle Puns, ambiguous Joke, Burst forth oracular in smoke, And Inspiration pottle deep, Forgets her sons, and falls asleep. Hence issue Treatses and Rhymes, The Wit and Wonder of the Times, Hence Scandal, Piracies and Lies, Defensive Pamphlets on Excise, The murd'rous Articles of News, And pert Theatrical Reviews. Hither, as to their Urns, repair, Bard, Publisher, and minor Play'r, And o'er the Porter's foaming head Their venom'd malice nightly shed, And aim their batteries of dirt At Genius, which they cannot hurt. Smack not tbeir works, if verse or prose Offend your eye, or ear, or nose, So frothy, vapid, stale, hum drum, Of Stingo, Porter, Purl and Mum? And when the muse politely jokes, Cannot you find the Lady smokes? And spite of all her inspiration, Betrays her alchouse education? Alas! how very few are found, Whose style tastes neat and full and sound! In Willmot's loose ungovern'd vein There is, I grant, much burnt Champaign And Dorset's lines all palates hit, The very Burgundy of wit. But when, obedient to the mode Of panegyric, courtly ode, The bard bestrides his annual hack, In vain I taste, and sip and smack, I find no flavour of the Sack. But while I ramble and refine On flavour, Style, and Wit and Wine, Your Claret, which I would not waste, Recalls me to my proper taste; So ending, as 'tis more than time, At once my Letter, glass and rhyme, I take this bumper off to you, 'Tis Sheperd's health—dear friend, adieu. THE CANDLE AND SNUFFERS. A FABLE. No author ever spar'd a brother: “Wits are game cocks to one another.” But no antipathy so strong, Which acts so fiercely, lasts so long As that which rages in the breast Of critic, and of wit profest: When, eager for some bold emprize, Wit, Titan-like, affects the skies, When, full of energy divine, The mighty dupe of all the nine, Bids his kite soar on paper wing, The critic comes, and cuts the string; Hence dire contention often grows 'Twixt man of verse, and man of prose; While prose-man deems the verse-man fool, And measures wit by line and rule, And, as he lops off fancy's limb, Turns executioner of whim; While genius, which too oft disdains To bear e'en honourable chains; (Such as a sheriff's self might wear, Or grace the wisdom of a may'r) Turns rebel to dame reason's throne And holds no judgment like his own. Yet while they spatter mutual dirt, In idle threats that cannot hurt, Methinks they waste a deal of time, Both fool in prose, and fool in rhyme. And when the angry bard exclaims, And calls a thousand paltry names, He doth his critic mighty wrong, And hurts the dignity of song. The prefatory matter past The tale, or story comes at last. A candle stuck in flaring state Within the nozel of French plate, Tow'ring aloft with smoaky light, The snuff and flame of wondrous height, (For, virgin yet of amputation, No force had check'd its inclination) Sullen address'd with conscious pride, The dormant snuffers at its side. “Mcan vulgar tools, whose envious aim “Strikes at the vitals of my flame, “Your rude assaults shall hurt no more, “See how my beams triumphant soar! “See how I gayly blaze alone “With strength, with lustre all my own. “Lustre, good sir!” the snuffers cried, “Alas! how ignorant is pride! “Thy light which wavers round the room, “Shews as the counterfeit of gloom, “Thy snuff which idly tow'rs so high “Will waste thy essence by and by, “Which, as I prize thy lustre dear “I fain would lop to make thee clear. “Boast not, old friend, thy random rays, “Thy wasting strength, and quiv'ring blaze, “You shine but as a beggar's link, “To burn away, and die in stink, “No merit waits unsteady light, “You must burn true as well as brigbt. Poets like candles all are puffers, And critics are the candle snuffers. THE TEMPLE OF FAVOUR. Tho' pilot in the ship no more, To bring the cargo safe to shore; Permit, as time and place afford, A passenger to come aboard. The shepherd who survey'd the deep, When all its tempests were asleep, Dreamt not of danger; glad was he To sell his flock, and put to sea. The consequence has Æsop told, He lost his venture, sheep and gold. So fares it with us sons of rhyme, From doggrel wit, to wit sublime; On ink's calm ocean all seems clear, No sands affright, no rocks appear; No lightnings blast, no thunders roar; No surges lash the peaceful shore; Till, all too vent'rous from the land, The tempests dash us on the strand: Then the low pirate boards the deck, And sons of thest enjoy the wreck. The harlot muse so passing gay, Bewitches only to betray; Tho' for a while, with easy air, She smooths the rugged brow of care, And laps the mind in flow'ry dreams, With fancy's transitory gleams. Fond of the nothings she bestows, We wake at last to real woes. Thro' ev'ry age, in ev'ry place, Consider well the poet's case; By turns protected and caress'd, Defam'd, dependant, and distress'd; The joke of wits, the bane of slaves, The curse of fools, the butt of knaves; Too proud to stoop for servile ends, To lacquey rogues, or flatter friends; With prodigality to give, Too careless of the means to live: The bubble fame intent to gain, And yet too lazy to maintain; He quits the world he never priz'd, Pitied by few, by more despis'd; And lost to friends, oppress'd by foes, Sinks to the nothing whence he rose. O glorious trade, for wit's a trade, Where men are ruin'd more than made. Let crazy Lee neglected Gay, The shabby Otway, Dryden grey, Those tuneful servants of the nine, (Not that I blend their names with mine) Repeat their lives, their works, their fame, And teach the world some useful shame. At first the Poet idly strays Along the greensward path of praise, Till on his journies up and down, To see, and to be seen, in town, What with ill-natur'd flings and rubs From flippant bucks, and backney scrubs, His toils thro' dust, thro' dirt, thro' gravel, Take off his appetite for travel. Transient is fame's immediate breath, Thought it blows stronger after death; Own then, with Martial, after fate If glory comes, she comes too late. For who'd his time and labour give For praise, by which he cannot live? But in Apollo's court of fame (In this all courts are much the same) By Favour folks must make their way, Favour, which lasts, perhaps, a day, And when you've twirl'd yourself about To wriggle in, you're wriggled out. 'Tis from the sunshine of her eyes Each courtly insect lives or dies; 'Tis she dispenses all the graces Of prosits, pensions, honours, places; And in her light capricious fits Makes wits of fools, and fools of wits, Gives vices, folly, dullness birth, Nay stamps the currency on worth; 'Tis she that lends the muse a spur, And even Kissing goes by Her. Far in the sea a temple stands Built by dame Error's hasty hands, Where in her dome of lucid shells The visionary goddess dwells. Here o'er her subject sons of earth Regardless or of place, or worth, She rules triumphant; and supplies The gaping world with hopes and lies. Her throne, which weak and tott'ring seems, Is built upon the wings of dreams; The fickle winds her altars bear Which quiver to the shifting air; Hither hath Reason seldom brought The child of Virtue or of Thought, And Justice with her equal face, Finds this, alas! no throne of Grace. Caprice, Opinion, Fashion wait, The porters at the temple's gate, And as the fond adorers press Pronounce fantastic happiness; While Favour with a Syren's smile, Which might Ulysses self beguile, Presents the sparkling bright libation, The nectar of intoxication; And summoning her ev'ry grace Of winning charms, and chearful face, Smiles away Reason from his throne, And makes his votaries her own: Instant resounds the voice of fame, Caught with the whistlings of their name, The fools grow frantic, in their pride Contemning all the world besinde: Pleas'd with the gewgaw toys of pow'r, The noisy pageant of an hour, Struts forth the statesman, haughty vain, Amidst a supple servile train, With shrug, grimace, nod, wink, and stare, So proud, he almost treads in air; While levee-fools, who sue for place, Crouch for employment from his Grace, And e'en good Bishops, taught to trim, Forsake their God to bow to him. The Poet in that happy hour, Imagination in his pow'r, Walks all abroad, and unconfin'd, Enjoys the liberty of mind: Dupe to the smoke of flimsy praise, He vomits forth sonorous lays; And, in his fine poetic rage, Planning, poor soul, a deathless page, Indulges pride's fantastic whim, And all the World must wake to him. A while from fear, from envy free, He sleeps on a pacific sea; Lethargic Error for a while Deceives him with her specious smile, And flatt'ring dreams delusive shed Gay gilded visions round his head. When, swift as thought, the goddess lewd Shifts the light gale; and tempests rude, Such as the northern skies deform, When fell Destruction guides the storm, Transport him to some dreary isle Where Favour never deign'd to smile. Where waking, helpless, all alone, 'Midst craggy steeps and rocks unknown; Sad scenes of woe his pride confound, And Desolation stalks around. Where the dull months no pleasures bring, And years roll round without a spring; Where He all hoeless, lost, undone, Sees chearless days that know no sun; Where jibing Scorn her throne maintains Midst mildews, blights, and blasts, and rains. Let others, with submissive knee, Capricious goddess! bow to Thee; Let them with fixt incessant aim Court fickle favour, faithless fame; Let vanity's fastidious slave Lose the kind moments nature gave, In invocations to the shrine Of Phœbus and the fabled Nine, An author, to his latest days, From hunger, or from thirst of praise, Let him thro' every subject roam To bring the useful morsel home; Write upon Liberty opprest, On happiness, when most distrest, Turn bookseller's obsequious tool, A monkey's cat, a mere fool's fool; Let him, unhallow'd wretch! profane The muse's dignity for gain, Yield to the dunce his sense contemns, Cringe to the knave his heart condemns, And, at a blockhead's bidding, force Reluctant genius from his course; Write ode, epistle, essay, libel, Make notes, or steal them, for the bible; Or let him, more judicial, sit The dull Lord Cbief, on culprit wit, With rancor read, with passion blame, Talk high, yet fear to put his name, And from the dark, but useful shade, (Fit place for murd'rous ambuscade,) Weak monthly shafts at merit hurl, The Gildon of some modern Curl. For me, by adverse fortune plac'd Far from the colleges of taste, I jostle no poetic name; I envy none their proper fame; And if sometimes an easy vein, With no design, and little pain, Form'd into verse, hath pleas'd a while, And caught the reader's transient smile, My muse hath answer'd all her ends, Pleasing herself, while pleas'd her friends; But, fond of liberty, disdains To bear restraint, or clink her chains; Nor would, to gain a Monarcb's favour, Let dulness, or her sons, enslave her. These two last lines were added by the Editor; to whom the piece was originally addressed on a particular occasion. THE SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION. A TALE. The very silliest things in life Create the most material strife. What scarce will suffer a debate, Will oft produce the bitterest hate. It is, you say; I say 'tis not —Why you grow warm—and you are hot. Thus each alike with passion glows, And words come first, and, after, blows. Friend Jerkin had an income clear, Some fifteen pounds, or more, a year, And rented, on the farming plan, Grounds at much greater sums per ann. A man of consequence, no doubt, 'Mongst all his neighbours round about; He was of frank and open mind, Too honest to be much refin'd, Would smoke his pipe, and tell his tale, Sing a good song, and drink his ale. His wife was of another mould; Her age was neither young nor old; Her features strong, but somewhat plain; Her air not bad, but rather vain; Her temper neither new nor strange, A woman's, very apt to change; What she most hated was conviction, What she most lov'd, flat Contradiction. A charming housewife ne'ertheless; —Tell me a thing she could not dress, Soups, hashes, pickles, puddings, pies, Nought came amiss—she was so wise. For she, bred twenty miles from town, Had brought a world of breeding down, And Cumberland had seldom seen A farmer's wife with such a mein; She could not bear the sound of Dame; —No—Mistress Jerkin was her name. She could harangue with wond'rous grace On gowns and mobs, and caps and lace; But tho' she ne'er adorn'd his brows, She had a vast contempt for spouse, As being one who took no pride, And was a deal too countrified. Such were our couple, man and wife; Such were their means and ways of life. Once on a time, the season fair For exercise and chearful air, It happen'd in his morning's roam, He kill'd his birds, and brought them home. —Here, Cicely, take away my gun— How shall we have these starlings done? Done! what my love? Your wits are wild; Starlings, my dear; they're thrushes child. Nay now but look, consider, wife, They're starlings—No—upon my life: Sure I can judge as well as you, I know a thrush and starling too. Who was it shot them, you or I? They're starlings—thrushes—zounds you lie. Pray, Sir, take back your dirty word, I scorn your language as your bird; It ought to make a husband blush, To treat a wife so 'bout a thrush. Thrush, Cicely!—Yes—a starling—No, The lie again, and then a blow. Blows carry strong and quick conviction, And mar the pow'rs of contradiction. Peace soon ensued, and all was well: It were imprudence to rebel, Or keep the ball up of debate Against these arguments of weight. A year roll'd on in perfect ease, 'Twas as you like, and what you please, 'Till in its course and order due, Came March the twentieth, fifty two. Quoth Cicely, this is charming life, No tumults now, no blow, no strife. What fools we were this day last year! Lord, how you beat me then, my dear! —Sure it was idle and absurd To wrangle so about a bird; A bird not worth a single rush— A starling—no, my love, a thrush, That I'll maintain—that I'll deny. —You're wrong, good husband—wife, you lie. Again the self-same wrangle rose, Again the lye, again the blows. Thus every year (true man and wife) Ensues the same domestic strife. Thus every year their quarrel ends, They argue, fight, and buss, and friends; 'Tis starling, thrush, and thrush and starling; You dog, you b—; my dear, my darling. A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO ? What, three months gone, and never send A single letter to a friend? In that time, sure, we might have known Whether you fat or lean was grown; Whether your host was short or tall, Had manners good, or none at all; Whether the neighb'ring squire you found As mere a brute as fox or hound; Or if the parson of the place (With all due rev'rence to his grace) Took much more pains himself to keep, Than to instruct and feed his sheep; At what hour of the day you dine; Whether you drink beer, punch, or wine; Whether you hunt, or shoot, or ride; Or, by some muddy ditch's side, Which you, in visionary dream, Call bubbling rill, or purling stream, Sigh for some aukward country lass, Who must of consequence surpass All that is beautiful and bright, As much as day surpasses night; Whether the people eat and drink, Or ever talk, or ever think; If, to the honour of their parts, The men have heads, the women hearts; If the moon rises and goes down, And changes as she does in town; If you've returns of night and day, And seasons varying roll away; Whether your mind exalted wooes Th' embraces of a serious muse; Or if you write, as I do now, The L—d knows what, the L—d knows how.— These, and a thousand things like these, The friendly heart are sure to please. Now will my friend turn up his eyes, And look superlatively wise; Wonder what all this stuff's about, And how the plague I found him out! When he had taken so much pains, In order to regale his brains With privacy and country air, To go, no soul alive knew where! Besides, 'tis folly to suppose That any person breathing goes On such a scheme, with a design To write or read such stuff as mine, And idly waste his precious time In all th' impertinence of rhyme. My good, wise, venerable sir! Why about nonsense all this stir! Is it, that you would stand alone, And read no nonsense but your own; Tho' you're (to tell you, by the bye) Not half so great a fool as I; Or is it that you make pretence, Being a fool, to have some sense? And would you really have my muse Employ herself in writing news, And most unconscionably teize her With rhyming to Warsaw and Weser; Or toss up a poetic olio, Merely to bring in Marshal Broglio? Should I recite what now is doing, Or what for future times is brewing, Or triumph that the poor French see all Their hopes defeated at Montreal, Or should I your attention carry To Fred'rick, Ferdinand, or Harry, Of flying Russian, dastard Swede, And baffled Austria let you read; Or gravely tell with what design The youthful Henry pass'd the Rhine? Or should I shake my empty head, And tell you that the king is dead, Observe what changes will ensue, What will be what, and who'll be who, Or leaving these things to my betters, Before you set the state of letters? Or should I tell domestic jars, How author against author wars, How both with mutual envy rankling, Fr—k—ng damns M—rp—y, M—rp—y Fr—k—ng? Or will it more your mind engage To talk of actors and the stage, To tell, if any words could tell, What Garrick acts still, and how well, That Sheridan with all his care Will always be a labour'd play'r, And that his acting at the best Is all but art, and art consest; That Bride, if reason may presume To judge by things past, things to come, In future times will tread the stage, Equally form'd for love and rage, Whilst Pope for comic humour fam'd, Shall live when Clive no more is nam'd. Your wisdom I suppose can't bear About dull pantomime to hear; Nor would you have a single word Of Harlequin, and wooden sword, Of dumb shew, fools tricks, and wry faces, And wit which lies all in grimaces, Nor should I any thing advance Of new invented comic dance. Callous, perhaps, to things like these, Would it your worship better please, That I, more loaden than the camels, Should crawl in philosophic trammels? Should I attack the stars, and stray In triumph o'er the milky way, And like the Titans try to move From seat of empire royal Jove, Then spread my terrors all around, And his Satellites confound, Teach the war far and wide to rage, And ev'ry star by turns engage? The danger we should share between us, You fight with Mars and I with Venus. Or should I rather, if I cou'd, Talk of words little understood, Centric, eccentric, epicycle, Fine words the vulgar ears to tickle! A vacuum, plenum, gravitation, And other words of like relation, Which may agree with studious men, But hurt my teeth, and gag my pen; Things of such grave and serious kind Puzzle my head and plague my mind; Besides in writing to a friend A man may any nonsense send, And the chief merit to impart, The honest feelings of his heart. CHARITY. A FRAGMENT. INSCRIBED TO THE REV. MR. HANBURY. Worth is excis'd, and Virtue pays A heavy Tax for barren praise. A friend to universal Man, Is universal good your plan? God may perhaps your project bless, But man shall strive to thwart success. Tho' the grand scheme thy thoughts pursue, Bespeak a noble generous view, Where Charity o'er all presides, And Sense approves what Virtue guides, Yet wars and tumults will commence, For Rogues hate virtue, Blockheads sense. Believe me, Opposition grows Not always from our real foes, But (where it seldom ever ends) From our more dangerous seeming friends. I hate not foes, for they declare, 'Tis War for War, and dare who dare; But your sly, sneaking, worming souls, Whom Friendship scorns, and Fear controuls, Who praise, support, and help by halves, Like Heifers, neither Bulls nor Calves; Who, in Hypocrisy's disguise, Are truly as the Serpent wise, But cannot All the precept love, And be as harmless as the Dove. Who hold each charitable meeting, To mean no more than good sound eating, While each becomes a hearty fellow According as he waxes mellow, And kindly helps the main design, By drinking its success in wine; And when his feet and senses reel, Totters with correspondent zeal; Nay, would appear a patron wise, But that his wisdom's in disguise, And would harangue, but that his mouth, Which ever hates the sin of drowth, Catching the full perpetual glass, Cannot afford a word to pass. Such, who like true Churchwardens eat, Because the Parish pays the treat, And of their bellyful secure, O'ersee, or over-look the poor, Who would no doubt be wond'rous just, And faithful Guardians of their trust, But think the deed might run more clever To them and to their Heirs for ever, That Charity, too apt to roam, Might end, where she begins, at home; Who make all public good a trade, Benevolence a mere parade, And Charity a cloak for sin, To keep it snug and warm within; Who flatter, only to betray, Who promise much and never pay, Who wind themselves about your heart With hypocritic, knavish art, Tell you what wond'rous things they're doing, And undermine you to your ruin; Such, or of low or high estate, To speak the honest truth, I hate: I view their tricks with indignation, And loath each fulsom protestation, As I would loath a whore's embrace, Who smiles, and smirks, and stroaks my face, And all so tender, fond and kind, As free of body, as of mind, Affects the softness of the Dove, And p—xes me to shew her Love. The Maiden wither'd, wrinkled pale, Whose charms, tho' strong, are rather stale, Will use that weapon call'd a tongue, To wound the beauteous and the young. —What, Delia handsome!—well!—I own I'm either blind or stupid grown. —The girl is well enough to pass, A rosy, simple, rustic lass; —But there's no meaning in her face, And then her air, so void of grace! And all the world, with half an eye, May see her shape grows quite awry. —I speak not from an ill design, For she's a favourite of mine, —Tho' I could wish that she would wear A more reserved becoming air; Not that I hear of indiscretions, Such folks, you know, make no confessions, Tho' the World says, that Parson there, That smock-fac'd Man, with darkish hair, He who wrote verses on her bird, The simplest things I ever heard, Makes frequent visits there of late, And is become exceeding great; This I myself aver is true, I saw him lead her to his pew. Thus scandal, like a false quotation, Misrepresents in defamation; And where she haply cannot spy A loop whereon to hang a lye, Turns every action wrong side out To bring her paultry tale about. Thus Excellence of every kind, Whether of body or of mind, Is but a mark set up on high, For knaves to guide their arrows by, A mere Scotch Post for public itch, Where Hog, or Man, may scrub his breech. But thanks to nature, which ordains A just reward for all our pains, And makes us stem, with secret pride, Hoarse Disappointment's rugged tide, And like a lordly ship, which braves The roar of winds, and rush of waves, Weather all storms, which jealous Hate Or frantic Malice may create. 'Tis Conscience, a reward alone, Conscience, who plac'd on Virtue's throne, Eyes raging men, or raging seas, Undaunted, firm, with heart at ease. From her dark Cave, tho' Envy rise With hollow cheeks, and jaundic'd eyes, Tho' Hatred league with Folly vain, And Spleen and Rancour join the train; Shall Virtue shrink, abash'd, afraid, And tremble at an idle shade? Fear works upon the Fool, or Knave, An honest man is always brave. While Opposition's fruitless aim Is as the bellows to the flame, And, like a Pagan persecution, Enforces Faith and Resolution. Tho' Prejudice in narrow minds, The mental eye of reason blinds; Tho' Wit, which not e'en friends will spare, Affect the sneering, laughing air, Tho' Dullness, in her monkish gown, Display the Wisdom of a frown, Yet Truth will force herself, in spite Of all their efforts, into light. See Bigot Monks in Spain prevail, See Galilæo dragg'd to gaol: Hear the grave Doctors of the schools, The Golgotha of learned Fools, As damnable and impious brand That art they cannot understand, And out of zeal pervert the Bible, As if it were a standing Libel, On every good and useful plan That rises in the brain of man. O Bigotry! whose frantic rage Has blotted half the classic page, And in Religion's drunken fit, Murder'd the Greek and Roman wit; Who zealous for that Faith's encrease, Whose ways are righteousness and peace, With rods and whips, and sword, and axe, With prisons, tortures, flames and racks; With persecution's fiery goad, Enforcing some new-fangl'd mode, Wouldst pluck down Reason from her throne To raise some fantom of thy own; Alas! thy fury undiscerning, Which blasts, and stunts, and hews up Learning, Like an ill-judging zealous friend, Blasphemes that Wisdom you defend. Go, kick the prostituted whores, The nine stale virgins out of doors; For let the Abbess beat her drum, Eleven thousand troops shall come; All female forms, and virgins true, As ever Saint or Poet knew. And glorious be the honour'd name Of Winifrede, of sainted fame, Who to the Church like light'ning sped, And ran three miles without her head; (Well might the modest Lady run, Since 'twas to keep her maiden one) And when before the congregation The Prince fell dead for reparation, Secure of Life as well as Honour, Ran back with both her heads upon her. No matter of what shape or size, Gulp down the Legendary Lies, Believe, what neither God ordains, Nor Christ allows, nor sense maintains; Make Saint of Pope, or Saint of Thief, Believe almost in unbelief; Yet with thy solemn priestly air, By book and bell, and candle swear, That God has made his own elect But from your stem and savorite sect; That He who made the world, has blest One part alone, to damn the rest, As if th' Allmerciful and Just, Who form'd us of one common dust, Had rendered up his own decree, And lent his attributes to thee. Thus his own eyes the Bigot blinds, To shut out light from human minds, And the clear truth (an emanation From the great Author of creation, A beam transmitted from on high, To bring us nearer to the sky, While ev'ry path by science trod, Leads us with wonder up to God) Is doom'd by Ignorance to make Atonement at the Martyr's stake; Tho', like pure gold, th' illustrious dame, Comes forth the brighter from the flame. No persecution will avail, No inquisition racks, nor gaol; When Learning's more enlight'ned ray Shall drive these sickly fogs away; A thankful age shall pay her more, Than all her troubles hurt before. See Shame and Scorn await on those Who poorly dar'd to be her foes, But will the grateful voice of fame Sink Truth, and Galilæo's name? How wilful, obstinate and blind, Are the main herd of human kind! Well said the Wit, who well had tried That malice which his Parts defied; When merit's sun begins to break, The Dunces stretch, and strive to wake, And amity of Dunce with Dunce, Fingers out Genius all at once. As you may find the honey out, By seeing all the flies about. All ugly Women hate a toast; The goodliest fruit is pick'd the most; The ivy winds about the oak, And to the fairest comes the smoke. Escap'd the dangers of the deep, When Gulliver fell fast asleep, Stretch'd on the Lilliputian strand, A Giant in a pigmy Land; Watchful against impending harms, All Lilliput cried out, To arms; The trumpets echoed all around, The Captain slept exceeding sound, Tho' crowds of undistinguish'd size Assail'd his body, legs and thighs, While clouds of arrows flew apace, And fell like feathers on his face. THE WHIM. AN EPISTLE TO MR. W. WOTY. The praise of Genius will offend A foe no doubt, sometimes a friend; But curse on genius, wit and parts, The thirst of science, love of arts, If inconsistent with the plan Of social good from man to man. For me, who will, may wear the bays, I value not such idle praise: Let wrangling wits abuse, desame, And quarrel for an empty name, What's in this shuffling pace of rhyme, Or grand pas stride of stiff sublime, That vanity her trump should blow, And look with scorn on solks below? Are wit and folly close ally'd, And match'd, like poverty, with pride? When rival bards for fame contend, The poet often spoils the friend; Genius self-center'd feels alone That merit he esteems his own, And cold, o'er jealous, and severe, Hates, like a Turk, a brother near; Malice steps in, good nature flies, Folly prevails, and friendship dies. Peace to all such, if peace can dwell With those who bear about a hell, Who blast all worth with envy's breath, By their own feelings stung to death. None but a weak and brainless fool, Undisciplin'd in fortune's school, Can hope for favours from the wit: He pleads prescription to forget, Unnotic'd let him live or rot, And, as forgetful, be forgot. Most wags, whose pleasure is to smoke, Wou'd rather lose their friend, than joke; A man in rags looks something queer, And there's vast humour in a sneer; That jest, alike all witlings suits, Which lies no further than the boots. Give me the man whose open mind Means social good to all mankind; Who when his friend, from fortune's round, Is toppled headlong to the ground, Can meet him with a warm embrace, And wipe the tear from sorrow's face. Who, not self-taught and proudly wise, Seeks more to comfort than advise, Who less intent to shine than please, Wears his own mirth with native ease; And is from sense, from nature's plan, The jovial guest, the honest man; In short, whose picture, painted true, In ev'ry point resembles you. And will my friend for once excuse This off'ring of a lazy muse, Most lazy,—lest you think her not, I'll draw her picture on the spot. A perfect ease the dame enjoys; Three chairs her indolence employs: On one she squats her cushion'd bum, Which wou'd not rise, tho' kings should come; An arm lolls dangling o'er another, A leg lies couchant on its brother. To make her look supremely wise, At least like wisdom in disguise, The weed, which first by Raleigh brought, Gives thinking looks instead of thought, She smokes, and smokes; without all feeling, Save as the eddies climb the cieling, And wast about their mild perfume, She marks their passage round the room. When pipe forsakes the vacant mouth, A pot of beer prevents her drowth, Which with potations pottle deep Lulls the poor maudlin muse to sleep. Her books of which sh'as wond'rous need, But neither pow'r nor will to read, In scatter'd tomes lie all around Upon the lowest shelf—the ground. Such ease no doubt suits easy rhyme; Folks walk about who write sublime, While recitation's pompous sound Drawls words sonorous all around, And action waves her hand and head, As those who bread and butter spread. You bards who feel not fancy's dearth, Who strike the roof, and kick the earth, Whose muse superlatively high Takes lodgings always near the sky; And like the lark with daring flight Still soars and sings beyond our sight; May trumpet forth your grand sublime, And scorn our lazy lounging rhyme. Yet tho' the lark in æther floats, And trills no doubt diviner notes, Carelesly perch'd on yonder spray, The linnet sings a pretty lay. What horrid, what tremendous sight Shakes all my fabric with affright! With Argus' hundred eyes he marks, With triple mouth the monster barks; And while he scatters flaming brands Briareus lends him all his hands. Hist! 'tis a critic—Yes—'tis he— What wou'd your graceless form with me? Is it t' upbraid me with the crime Of spinning unlaborious rhyme, Of stringing various thoughts together In verse, or prose, or both, or neither? A vein, which tho' it must offend You lofty sirs who can't descend, To fame has often made its way From Butler, Prior, Swift and Gay; Is it for this your brow austere Frowns me to stone for very fear? Hear my just reason first, and then Approve me right, or split my pen. I seek not by more labour'd lays To catch the slipp'ry tail of praise, Nor will I run a mad career 'Gainst genius which I most revere; When Phœbus bursts with genuine fire, The little stars at once retire; Who cares a farthing for those lays Which you can neither blame, nor praise? I cannot match a Churchill's skill, But may be Langhorne when I will. Let the mere mimic, for each season bears Your mimic Bards as well as mimic play'rs, Creep servilely along, and with dull pains Lash his slow steed, in whose enseebled veins The cold blood lags, let him with fruitless aim By borrow'd plumes assume a borrow'd fame, With studied forms th' incautious ear beguile, And ape the numbers of a Churchill's style. Slaves may some fame from imitation hope; Who'd be Paul Whitehead, tho' he honours Pope? If clinking couplets in one endless chime Be the sole beauty, and the praise of rhyme; If sound alone an easy triumph gains, While fancy bleeds, and sense is hung in chains, Ye happy triflers hail the rising mode; See, all Parnassus is a turnpike road, Where each may travel in the highway track On true bred hunter, or on common hack. For me, who labour with poetic sin, Who often woo the muse I cannot win, Whom pleasure first a willing poet made, And folly spoilt by taking up the trade, Pleas'd I behold superior genius shine, Nor ting'd with envy wish that genius mine. To Churchill's muse can bow with decent awe, Admire his mode, nor make that mode my law: Both may, perhaps, have various pow'rs to please; Be his the strength of numbers, mine the ease. Ease that rejects not, but betrays no care: Less of the coxcomb than the sloven's air. Your taste, as mine, all metre must offend, When imitation is its only end. I could perhaps that servile task pursue, And copy Churchill as I'd copy you, But that my flippant muse, too saucy grown, Prefers that manner she can call her own. ODE TO GENIUS. Thou child of nature, genius strong, Thou master of the poet's song, Before whose light, Art's dim and feeble ray Gleams like the taper in the blaze of day: Thou lov'st to steal along the secret shade, Where Fancy, bright aerial maid! Awaits thee with her thousand charms, And revels in thy wanton arms. She to thy bed, in days of yore, The sweetly warbling Shakespeare bore; Whom every muse endow'd with every skill, And dipt him in that sacred rill, Whose silver streams flow musical along, Where Phœbus' hallow'd mount resounds with raptur'd song. Forsake not thou the vocal choir, Their breasts revisit with thy genial fire, Else vain the studied sounds of mimic art, Tickle the ear, but come not near the heart. Vain every phrase in curious order set, On each side leaning on the [stop-gap] epithet. Vain the quick rhyme still tinkling in the close, While pure description shines in measur'd prose. Thou bear'st aloof, and look'st with high disdain, Upon the dull mechanic train; Whose nerveless strains flag on in languid tone, Liseless and lumpish as the bagpipe's drowzy drone. No longer now thy altars blaze, No poet offers up his lays; Inspir'd with energy divine, To worship at thy sacred shrine. Since taste By Taste, is here meant the modern affectation of it. with absolute domain, Extending wide her leaden reign, Kills with her melancholy shade, The blooming scyons of fair fancy's tree; Which erst full wantonly have stray'd In many a wreath of richest poesie. For when the oak denies her stay, The creeping ivy winds her humble way; No more she twists her branches round, But drags her seeble stem along the barren ground. Where then shall exil'd genius go? Since only those the laurel claim, And boast them of the poet's name, Whose sober rhymes in even tenour flow; Who prey on words, and all their flow'rets cull, Coldly correct, and regularly dull. Why sleep the sons of genius now? Why, Wartons, rests the lyre unstrung? Dr. Akenside.And thou, blest bard! around whose sacred brow, Great Pindar's delegated wreath is hung: Arise, and snatch the majesty of song From dullness' servile tribe, and art's unhallow'd throng. THE EPITAPH. Here rests his head upon the lap of earth, A youth to fortune and to fame unknown, Fair science frown'd not on his humble birth, And melancholy mark'd him for her own. Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere, Heav'n did a recompence as largely send: He gave to mis'ry all he had, a tear, He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend. No sarther seek his merits to disclose, Or draw his frailties from their dread abode, (There they alike in trembling hope repose) The bosom of his Father and his God. PART OF HOMER'S HYMN TO APOLLO. TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK. God of the Bow! Apollo, thee I sing; Thee, as thou draw'st amain the sounding string, Th' immortal pow'rs revere with homage low, And ev'ry godhead trembles at thy bow. All but Latona: She with mighty Jove Eyes thee with all a tender parent's love; Closes thy quiver, thy tough bow unbends, And high amid th' æthereal dome suspends, Then smiling leads thee, her all-glorious son, To share the mighty Thunderer's awful throne. Goblets of nectar thy glad sire prepares, And thee, his fairest, noblest son declares; While ev'ry god sits rapt, Latona's breast Beats with superior joy, and hails her son confest. Thrice blest Latona! from thee, Goddess, sprung Diana chaste, and Phœbus ever-young: Delos and Ortygia are mentioned as different Islands in the Original.Her in Ortygia's isle, and Him you bore At Cynthius' hill on Delos' sea-girt shore, Where the tall palm uprears its lovely head, And clear Inopus laves the flow'ry mead. O Phœbus, where shall I begin thy praise? Well can'st thou rule the poet's artless lays. Oft on the craggy rock, or mountain hoar, By river side, or on the sea's hoarse shore, Wand'ring well-pleas'd, with music's magic sound, And airs divine, thou charm'st the region round. Say, shall I sing how first on Delos' shore, Thee, glorious progeny, Latona bore? Here several verses containing nothing but a mere list of the names of islands are omitted. How first, from other isles, beset with grief, In vain thy tortur'd mother sought relief. Each to her out-cast woe denied abode, Nor durst one isle receive the future god. At length to Delos came the lab'ring fair, And suppliant thus besought her needful care. Delos! receive Apollo, and O! raise A glorious temple to record his praise! Then shall He govern thee with gentle sway, And only Phœbus shall thine isle obey. What though no flocks, nor herds, nor juicy vine, Nor plants of thousand natures shall be thine, Swift to the temple of the Bowyer-king Bowyer-king and Bowyer-god are expressions frequently used by Dryden, in his version of the first Iliad, to signify Apollo., Oblations rich shall ev'y nation bring; For ever from thy altars shall arise The fragrant incense of burnt-sacrifice. No longer then regret thy barren soil, Receive the God, and live by other's toil! She spake: with inward rapture Delos smil'd, And sooth'd the suppliant pow'r with answer mild. Latona! mighty Cæus' daughter fair, Full willingly wou'd Delos ease thy care, Full willingly behold her barren earth Witness the glories of Apollo's birth: The mighty God wou'd raise my lowly name, And consecrate his native isle to same. One fear alone distracts my beating heart; That fear, O Goddess, list while I impart. Second to none amid th' æthereal skies, Apollo soon all terrible shall rise: All nations shall adore the mighty God, And kings and kingdoms tremble at his nod. Haply (for ah! dire fears my soul infest, And fill with horror my tumultuous breast) Soon as the glorious Godhead shall be born, My desert region will he view with scorn, Indignant spurn me, curse my barren soil, And plunge into the waves my hated isle. Triumphant then to happier climes remove, There fix his shrine, plant there his sacred grove. Whelm'd in the briny main shall Delos lay, To all the finny brood a wretched prey. But, O Latona! if, to quell my fear, You'll deign a solemn sacred oath to swear, That here the God his glorious seat shall hold, And here his sapient oracles unfold, Your sacred burthen here, Latona, lay, Here view the Godhead bursting into day. Thus Delos pray'd, nor was her pray'r denied, But soon with solemn vows thus ratified: Witness O heaven and earth! O Stygian lake! Dire adjuration, that no God may break! In Delos shall Apollo's shrine be rear'd, Delos, his best belov'd, most honour'd, most rever'd. Thus vow'd Latona: Delos hail'd her earth Blest in the glories of Apollo's birth. Nine hapless days and nights, with writhing throes, And all the anguish of a mother's woes, Latona tortur'd lay; in sorrowing mood, Around her many a sister-goddess stood. Aloft in heaven imperial Juno sat, And view'd relentless her unhappy fate. Lucina too, the kind assuaging pow'r That tends the lab'ring mother's child bed hour, And mitigates her woes, in golden clouds High on Olympus' top the Goddess shrouds. Her large full eyes with indignation roll, And livid envy seiz'd her haughty soul, That from Latona's loins was doom'd to spring So great a son, the mighty Bowyer-king. The milder pow'rs, that near the lab'ring fair View'd all her pangs with unavailing care, Fair Iris sent, the many colour'd maid, To gain with goodly gists Lucina's aid. But charg'd her heed, lest Juno should prevent With prohibition dire their kind intent. Fleet as the winged winds, the flying fair With nimble pinion cut the liquid air. Olympus gain'd, apart she call'd the maid, Then sought with many a pray'r her needful aid, And mov'd her soul: when soon with dove-like pace Swiftly they measur'd back the viewless airy space. Soon as to Delos' isle Lucina came The pangs of travail seiz'd Latona's frame. Her twining arms she threw the palm around, And prest with deep-indented knee the ground: Then into day sprung forth the jolly boy, Earth smil'd beneath, and heaven rang with joy. The Sister Pow'rs that round Latona stood With chaste ablutions cleans'd the infant-god. His lovely limbs in mantle white they bound, And gently drew a golden swathe around. He hung not helpless at his mother's breast, But Themis fed him with an heavenly feast. Pleas'd while Latona views the heavenly boy, And fondly glows with all a mother's joy, The lusty babe, strong with ambrosial food, In vain their bonds or golden swathes withstood, Bonds, swathes, and ligaments with ease he broke, And thus the wondring Deities bespoke; “The lyre, and sounding bow, and to declare “The Thund'rer's counsels, be Apollo's care!” He spake; and onwards all majestic strode; The Queens of Heaven awe-struck view'd the God. Delos beheld him with a tender smile, And hail'd, enrich'd with gold, her happy isle; Her happy isle, Apollo's native seat, His sacred haunt, his best-belov'd retreat. Grac'd with Apollo, Delos glorious shines, As the tall mountain crown'd with stately pines. Now stony Cynthus wou'd the God ascend, And now his course to various islands bend. Full many a fane, and rock, and shady grove, River, and mountain did Apollo love; But chiefly Delos: The Ionians there, With their chaste wives and prattling babes, repair. There gladly celebrate Apollo's name With many a solemn rite and sacred game; The jolly dance and holy hymn prepare, And with the Cæstus urge the manly war. If, when their sacred feast th' Ionians hold, Their gallant sports a stranger shou'd behold, View the strong nerves the brawny chiess that brace, Or eye the softer charms of female grace; Then mark their riches of a thousand kinds, And their tall ships born swift before the winds, So goodly to the sight wou'd all appear, The fair assembly Gods he wou'd declare. There too the Delian Virgins, beauteous choir, Apollo's handmaids, wake the living lyre; To Phœbus first they consecrate the lays, Latona then and chaste Diana praise, Then heroes old, and matrons chaste rehearse, And sooth the raptur'd heart with sacred verse. Each voice, the Delian maids, each human sound With aptest imitation sweet resound: Their tongues so justly tune with accents new, That none the false distinguish from the true. Latona! Phœbus! Dian, lovely fair! Blest Delian nymphs, Apollo's chiefest care, All hail! and O with praise your poet crown, Nor all his labours in oblivion drown! If haply some poor pilgrim shall enquire, “O, virgins, who most skilful smites the lyre? “Whose lofty verse in sweetest descant rolls, “And charms to extasy the hearers souls?” O answer, a blind bard in Chios dwells, In all the arts of verse who far excells. Then o'er the earth shall spread my glorious fame, And distant Nations shall record my name. But Phœbus never will I cease to sing, Latona's noble son, the mighty Bowyer-king. Thee Lycia and Mæonia, thee, great Pow'r, The blest Miletus' habitants adore; But thy lov'd haunt is sea-girt Delos' shore. Now Pytho's stony soil Apollo treads, And all around ambrosial fragrance sheds, Then strikes with matchless art the golden strings, And ev'ry hill with heavenly musick rings. Olympus now and the divine abodes Glorious he seeks, and mixes with the Gods. Each heavenly bosom pants with fond desire To hear the lofty verse and golden lyre. Drawn by the magic sound, the Virgin-Nine With warblings sweet the sacred minstrel join: Now with glad heart, loud voice, and jocund lays Full sweetly carol bounteous heaven's praise; And now in dirges fad, and numbers slow Relate the piteous tale of human woe; Woe, by the Gods on wretched mortals cast, Who vainly shun affliction's wintry blast, And all in vain attempt with fond delay Death's certain shaft to ward, or chase old age away. The Graces there, and smiling Hours are seen, And Cytherea, laughter-loving queen, And Harmony, and Hebe, lovely band, To sprightliest measures dancing hand in hand. There, of no common port or vulgar mien, With heavenly radiance, shines the Huntress-Queen, Warbles responsive to the golden lyre, Tunes her glad notes, and joins the virgin choir. There Mars and Mercury with aukward play, And uncouth gambols, waste the live-long day. There as Apollo moves with graceful pace A thousand glories play around his face; In splendor drest he joins the sestive band, And sweeps the golden lyre with magic hand. Mean while, Latona and imperial Jove Eye the bright Godhead with parental love; And, as the Deities around him play, Well pleas'd his goodly mien and awful port survey The translator, when he begun this piece, had some thoughts of giving a complete English version of all Homer's Hymns, being the only parts of his works never yet translated; but (to say nothing of his opinion of this specimen of his translation) fearing that this species of poetry, though it has its beauties, and does not want admirers among the learned, would appear far less agreeable to the mere English reader, he desisted. They, who would form the justest idea of this sort of composition among the ancients, may be better informed, by perusing Dr. Akenside's most classical Hymn to the Naiads, than from any translation of Homer or Callimachus.. FROM CATULLUS. Chloe, that dear bewitching prude, Still calls me saucy, pert, and rude, And sometimes almost strikes me; And yet, I swear, I can't tell how, Spite of the knitting of her brow, I'm very sure she likes me. Ask you me, why I fancy thus? Why, I have call'd her jilt, and puss, And thought myself above her; And yet I feel it, to my cost, That when I rail against her most, I'm very sure I love her. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE HENRIADE. TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF M. DE VOLTAIRE. Thy chieftain, France, of try'd illustrious worth, By right of conquest king, by right of birth, I sing. Who, tutor'd in misfortune's school, There learnt the noblest science, how to Rule; Bad Faction's furious discord cease to rave, Valiant to conquer, merciful to save; Baffled the daring League's rebellious schemes, Mayenne's proud hopes, and Spain's ambitious dreams: With civil prudence blest, with martial fire, A nation's conqueror, and a nation's sire. Truth, heavenly maid, from th' Empyræan height Descend, and with thy strong and purest light My verse illume! and O, let mortals hear Thy sacred word, and awfully revere! Be thou my guide! thy sage experience brings Unerring maxims to the ear of kings. 'Tis thine, blest maid, and only thine, to show What most befits the regal pow'r to know. Purge thou the film from off a nation's eyes, And she what ills from civil discord rise! Nor spare with decent boldness to disclose The prince's errors, and the people's woes: And O! if fable e'er, in times of yore, Mix'd her soft accents with thy sterner lore, If e'er her hand adorn'd thy tow'ring head, And o'er thy front her milder graces spread; If e'er her shades, which lovingly unite, Bad thy fair form spring stronger into light, With me, permit her all thy steps to trace, Not to conceal thy beauties, but to grace! Still Valois reign'd, and sunk in pleasure's bow'r, O'er a mad state held loose the reigns of pow'r: The trampled Law had lost its ancient force, And Right confounded, miss'd her even course. 'Twas thus when Valois France's sceptre bore, Scepter'd indeed, but now a king no more; Not glory's minion now, the voice of fame, Swell'd the loud trumpet to the hero's name; His laurel's wither'd, and all blasted now, Which conquest hung upon his infant brow; Whose progress Europe mark'd with conscious fear, Whose loss provok'd his country's common tear, When, the long train of all his virtues known, The North admiring call'd him to the throne. In second rank, the light which strikes the eyes, Rais'd to the first, grows dim, and feebly dies. From war's stern soldier, active, firm, and brave, He sunk a monarch, pleasure's abject slave. Lull'd with soft ease, forgetful all of state, His weakness totter'd with a kingdom's weight; Whilst lost in sloth, and dead to glorious fame, The sons of riot govern'd in his name. Quelus, St. Maigrin, death-cemented pair, Joyeuse the gay, and D' Espernon the fair, The careless king in pleasure plung'd with these, In lust intemperate, and lethargic ease. Mean time, the Guises, fortunate and brave, Catch'd the fair moment which his weakness gave. Then rose the fatal League in evil hour, That dreadful rival of his waning pow'r. The people blind, their sacred Monaich brav'd, Led by those Tyrants, who their rights enslav'd. His friends forsook him, helpless and alone, His servants chas'd him from his royal throne; Revolted Paris, deaf to kingly awe, Within her gates the crouding stranger saw. Through all the city burst rebellion's flame; And all was lost, when virtuous Bourbon came; Came, full of warlike ardour, to restore That light his prince, deluded, had no more. His active presence breath'd an instant flame; No longer now the sluggish sons of shame, Onward they press, where glory calls, to arms, And spring to War from Pleasure's silken charms: To Paris' gates both kings advance amain, Rome felt th' alarm, and trembled haughty Spain: While Europe, watching where the tempest falls, With anxious eyes beheld th' unhappy walls. Within was Discord, with her hell-born train, Stirring to war the League, and haughty Mayne, The people, and the church: and from on high Call'd out to Spain, rebellion's prompt ally. Discord, dread monster, deas to human woe, To her own subjects an avengeful foe, Bloody, impetuous, eager to destroy, In man's misfortune founds her hateful joy; To neither party ought of mercy shown, Well-pleas'd she stabs the dagger in her own; Dwells a fierce tyrant in the breast she fires, And smiles to punish what herself inspires. West of the city, near those borders gay, Where Seine obliquely winds her sloping way, (Scenes now, where pleasure's soft retreats are found, Where triumphs art, and nature smiles around, Then, by the will of fate, the bloody stage For war's stern combat and relentless rage) Th' unhappy Valois bad his troops advance, There rush'd at once the generous strength of France. A thousand heroes, eager for the fight, By sects divided, from revenge unite. These virtuous Bourbon leads, their chosen guide, Their cause confederate, and their hearts allied. It seem'd the army felt one common flame, Their zeal, religion, cause, and chief the same. The sacred Louis, sire of Bourbon's race, From azure skies, beside the throne of grace, With holy joy beheld his future heir, And ey'd the Hero with paternal care; With such as prophets feel, a blest presage, He saw the virtues of his ripening age: Saw Glory round him all her laurels deal, Yet wail'd his errors, tho' he lov'd his zeal; With eye prophetic he beheld e'en now, The crown of France adorn his royal brow; He knew the wreath was destin'd which they gave, More will'd the Saint, the light which shines to save. Still Henry's steps mov'd onward to the throne, By secret ways, e'en to himself unknown. His help from Heaven the Holy Prophet sent, But hid the arm his wise indulgence lent; Lest sure of conquest, he had slack'd his flame, Nor grappl'd danger for the meed of fame. Already Mars had donn'd his coat of mail, And doubtful Conquest held her even scale; Carnage with blood had mark'd his purple way, And slaughter'd heaps in wild confusion lay, When Valois thus his part'ner king addrest, The sigh deep-heaving from his anxious breast. “You see what fate, what humbling fate is mine, “Nor yet alone,—the injury is thine. “The dauntless League, by hardy Chieftains led, “Which hisses faction with her Hydra head, “Boldly confederate by a desperate oath, “Aims not at me alone, but strikes at both. “Tho' I long since the regal circle wear, “Tho' thou by rank succeed my rightful heir, “Paris disowns us, nor will homage bring “To me their present, you their future king. “Thine, well they know the next illustrious claim, “From law, from birth, and deeds of loudest fame; “Yet from that throne's hereditary right “Where I but totter, wou'd exclude thee quite. “Religion hurls her furious bolts on thee, “And holy councils join her firm decree: “Rome, tho' she raise no soldier's martial band, “Yet kindles war thro' every awe-struck land; “Beneath her banners bids each host repair, “And trusts her thunder to the Spaniard's care, “Far from my hopes each summer friend is flown, “No subjects hail me on my sacred throne; “No kindred now the kind affection shows, “All fly, their king, abandon, or oppose: “Rich in my spoils, with greedy treacherous haste, “While the base Spaniard lays my country waste. “Midst foes like these, abandon'd, and betray'd, “France in her turn shall seek a foreign aid: “Shall Britain's court by secret methods try, “And win Eliza for a firm ally. “Of old I know between each pow'rful state, “Subsists a jealous and immortal hate; “That London lifts its tow'ring front on high, “And looks on Paris with a rival eye; “But I, the monarch of each pageant throne, “Have now no subjects, and no country own: “Vengeance alone my stern resolves avow, “Who gives me that, to me is Frenchman now. “The snail-pac'd agents, whose deliberate way, “Creeps on in trammels of prescrib'd delay, “Such fit not now; 'tis You, great Prince, alone “Must haste a suppliant to Eliza's throne. “Your voice alone shall needful succours bring, “And arm Britannia for an injur'd king. “To Albion hence, and let thy happier name “Plead the king's cause, and raise their generous flame! “My foes' defeat upon thy arm depends, “But from thy virtues I must hope for friends.” Thus spoke the king, while Henry's looks confest The jealous ardour which inflam'd his breast, Lest others' arms might urge their glorious claim, And ravish from him half the meed of fame. With deep regret the Hero number'd o'er The wreaths of glory he had won before; When, without succours, without skill's intrigue, Himself with Conde shook the trembling League. When those command, who hold the regal sway, It is a subject's virtue to obey. Resolv'd to follow what the King commands, The blows, suspended, fell not from his hands; He rein'd the ardour of his noble mind, And parting left the gather'd wreaths behind. Th' astonish'd army felt a deep concern, Fate seem'd depending on the Chief's return. His absence still unknown, the pent-up foe In dire expectance dread the sudden blow; While Valois' troops still feel their hero's flame, And virtue triumphs in her Henry's name. Of all his fav'rites, none their chief attend, Save Mornay brave, his soul's familiar friend. Mornay of steady faith, and manners plain, And truth, untainted with the flatt'rers strain; Rich in desert, of valour rarely tried, A virtuous champion, tho' on error's side; With signal prudence blest, with patriot zeal Firm to his church, and to the public weal; Censor of courtiers, but by courts belov'd, Rome's fierce assailant, and by Rome approv'd. Across two rocks, where with tremendous roar, The foaming ocean lashes either shore, To Dieppe's strong port the Hero's steps repair, The ready sailors ply their busy care. The tow'ring ships, old ocean's lordly kings, Aloft in air display their canvas wings; Not swell'd by Boreas now, the glassy seas Flow'd calmly on, with Zephyr's gentle breeze. Now, anchor weigh'd, they quit the friendly shore, And land receding greets their eyes no more. Jocund they sail'd, and Albion's chalky height At distance rose full fairly to the sight. When rumbling thunders rend th' affrighted pole, Loud roar the winds, and seas tempestuous roll: The livid lightnings cleave the darken'd air, And all around reigns horror and despair. No partial fear the Hero's bosom knows, Which only trembled for his country's woes, It seem'd his looks toward her in silence bent, Accus'd the winds, which cross'd his great intent. So Cæsar, striving for a conquer'd world, Near Epire's banks, with adverse tempests hurl'd, Trusting, undaunted, and securely brave, Rome's and the world's fate to the swelling wave. Tho' leagu'd with Pompey Neptune's self engage, Oppos'd his fortune to dull Ocean's rage. Mean time that God, whose power the tempest binds, Who rides triumphant on the wings of winds, That God, whose wisdom, which presides o'er all, Can raise, protect, or crush this earthly ball, From his bright throne, beyond the starry skies, Beheld the Hero with considering eyes, God was his guide, and 'mid the tempest's roar The tossing vessel reach'd the neighbouring shore; Where Jersey rises from the ocean's bed, There, heaven-conducted, was the Hero led. At a small distance from the shore, there stood The growth of many years, a shadowy wood. A neighbouring rock the calm retirement saves From the rude blasts, and hoarse-resounding waves. A grotto stands behind, whose structure knows The simple grace, which nature's hand bestows. Here far from court remov'd, a holy Sage Spent the mild evening of declining age. While free from worldly toils, and worldly woe, His only study was himself to know: Here mus'd, regretting on his mispent days, Or lost in love, or pleasure's flowry maze. No gusts of folly swell the dangerous tide, While all his passions to a calm subside; The bubble life he held an empty dream, His food the simple herb, his drink the stream; Tranquil and calm he drew his aged breath, And look'd with patience toward the port of death, When the pure soul to blissful realms shall soar, And join with God himself to part no more. The God he worshipp'd ey'd the zealous Sage, And bless'd with wisdom's lore his silver'd age: Gave him the skill of prophecy to know, And from fate's volume read events below. The Sage with conscious joy the Prince address'd, And spread the table for his royal guest; The prompt repast, which simple nature suits, The stream's fresh water, and the forest's roots. Not unaccustom'd to the homely fare, The Warrior sat; for oft from busy care, From courts retir'd, and pomp's fastidious pride, The Hero dar'd to throw the king aside: And in the rustic cot well-pleas'd partook Of labour's mean repast, and chearful look; Found in himself the joys to kings unknown And self depos'd forgot the lordly throne. The world's contention to their minds supplies Much converse, wholsome to the good and wise. Much did they talk of woes in human life, Of Christian kingdoms torn with jarring strife. The zeal of Mornay, like a stubborn fort, Attach'd to Calvin stood his firm support. Henry, still doubting, sought th' indulgent skies, That lights' clear ray might burst upon his eyes, “Must then, said he, the truth be always found, “To mortals weak with mists encompas'd round? “Must I still err, my way in darkness trod, “Nor know the path which leads me to my God? “If all alike he will'd us to obey, “The God who will'd it, had prescrib'd the way. “Let us not vainly God's designs explore! “(The Sage reply'd) be humble, and adore! “Arraign not madly heav'n's unerring laws “For faults, where mortals are themselves the cause. “These aged eyes beheld in days of yore, “When Calvin's doctrine reach'd the Gallic shore, “Then, tho' with blood it now distains the earth, “Creeping in shade and humble in the birth, “I saw it banish'd by religion's laws, “Without one friend to combat in the cause. “Thro' ways oblique I saw the phantom tread, “Slow winding, and asham'd to rear her head, “'Till, at the last, upheld by pow'rsul arms, “'Midst cannon's thunder, and 'mid war's alarms, “Burst forth the Monster in the glare of light, “With tow'ring front full dreadful to the sight; “To scoul at mortals from her tyrant seat, “And spurn our altars at her impious feet. “Far then from courts, beneath this peaceful cot, “I wail'd Religion's and my Country's lot; “Yet here, to comfort my declining days, “Some dawn of hope presents its chearful rays. “So new a worship cannot long survive, “Which man's caprice alone has kept alive. “With that it rose, with that shall die away, “Man's works and Man are bubbles of a day. “The God, who reigns for ever and the same, “At pleasure blasts a world's presumptuous aim. “Vain is our malice, vain our strength display'd, “To sap the city his right hand hath made; “Himself hath fix'd the strong foundations low, “Which brave the wreck of time, and hell's inveterate blow: “The Lord of Lords shall bless thy purged sight “With bright effulgence of diviner light; “On thee, Great Prince, his mercies he'll bestow, “And shed that Truth thy bosom pants to know. “That God hath chose thee, and his hand alone “Safe through the war shall lead thee to a throne. “Conquest already (for his voice is fate,) “For thee bids Glory ope her golden gate. “If on thy sight the Truth unnotic'd falls, “Hope not admission in thy Paris' walls. “Tho' splendid Ease invite thee to her arms, “O shun, Great Prince, the Syren's poison'd charms! “O'er thy strong passions hold a glorious reign, “Fly love's soft lap, break pleasure's silken chain! “And when, with efforts strong, all foes o'er thrown, “A league's great conqueror, and what's more Your Own, “When, with united hearts, and triumph's voice, “Thy people hail thee with one common choice, “From a dread siege, to fame for ever known, “To mount with glory thy paternal throne, “That time, Affiction shall lay by her rod, “And thy glad eyes shall seek thy father's God: “Then shalt thou see from whence thy arms prevail. “Go, Prince—Who trusts in GOD—can never fail.” Each word the Sage's holy lips impart, Falls, like a flame, on Henry's generous heart. The Hero stood transported in his mind To times, when God held converse with mankind, When simple virtue taught her heav'n-born lore, And Truth commanding bid e'en kings adore. His eager arms the reverend Sage embrace, And the warm tear fast trickled down his face. Untouch'd, yet lost awhile in deep surprise, Stood Mornay brave; for still on Mornay's eyes Hung error's mist, and God's high will conceal'd The gifts from him to Henry's breast reveal'd. His wisdom idly wou'd the world prefer, Whose lot, tho' rich in virtues, was to err. While the wrapt Sage fulfilling God's behest, Spoke inspiration to the Prince's breast, Hush'd were the winds, within their caverns bound, Smooth flow'd the seas, and nature smil'd around. The Sage his guide, the Hero sought his way Where the tall vessels safe at anchor lay: The ready sailors quit the friendly strand, Hoist the glad sails, and make for Albion's land. While o'er her coast his eyes admiring range, He prais'd in silence Britain's happier change: Where laws abus'd by soul intestine foes, Had erst entail'd a heap of dreadful woes On prince and people; on that bloody stage, Where slaughter'd heroes bled for civil rage; On that bright throne, from whence descended springs, Th' illustrious lineage of a hundred kings, Like Henry, long in adverse fortune school'd, O'er willing English hearts a Woman rul'd: And, rich in manly courage, female grace, Clos'd the long lustre of her crouded race. Eliza then, in Britain's happiest hour, Held the just balance of contending pow'r; Made English subjects bow the willing knee, Who will not serve, and are not happy free. Beneath her sacred reign the nation knows No sad remembrance of its former woes; Their flocks securely graz'd the fertile plain, Their garners bursting with their golden grain. The stately ships, their swelling sails unfurl'd, Brought wealth and homage from the distant world: All Europe watch'd Britannia's bold decree, Dreaded by land, and monarch of the sea. Wide o'er the waves her fleet exulting rode, And fortune triumph'd over Ocean's God. Proud London now, no more of barbarous fame, To arms and commerce urg'd her blended claim. Her pow'rs, in union leagu'd, together sate, King, Lords, and Commons, in their threefold state. Though separate each their several interest draw, Yet all united form the stedfast law. All three, one body's members, firm and fit, Make but one pow'r in strong conjunction knit; Pow'r to itself of danger often found, But spreading terror to its neighbours round. Blest, when the people duty's homage show, And pay their king the tribute which they owe! More blest, when kings for milder virtues known, Protect their people's freedom from the throne! “Ah when, cry'd Bourbon, shall our discord cease, “Our glory, Albion, rise, like thine, in peace? “Blush, blush, ye kings, ye lords of jarring states, “A Woman bids, and War hath clos'd its gates: “Your countries bleed with factious rage opprest, “While She reigns happy o'er a people blest.” Mean time the Hero reach'd the sea-girt isle, Where freedom bids eternal plenty smile; Not far from William's Tow'r at distance seen, Stood the fam'd palace of the Virgin Queen. Hither, the faithful Mornay at his side, Without the noise and pageant pomp of pride, The toys of grandeur which the vain pursue, But glare unheeded to the Hero's view, The Prince arriv'd: With bold and manly sense He spoke, his frankness, all his eloquence; Told his sad tale, and bow'd his lofty heart, For France's woes, to act submission's part; For needful aids the British Queen addrest, While in the suppliant shone the king confest. “Com'st thou, reply'd the Queen, with strange surprise, “Com'st thou from Valois for the wish'd allies? “Ask'st thou protection for a tyrant foe, “Whose deadly hate work'd all thy fortune's woe? “Far as the golden sun begins to rise, “To where he drives adown the western skies, “His strife and Thine to all the world is known: “Stand'st thou for Him a friend at Britain's throne? “And is that hand, which Valois oft hath fear'd, “Arm'd in his cause, and for his vengeance rear'd?” When thus the Prince: “A monarch's adverse fate “Wipes all remembrance out of former hate. “Valois was then a slave, his passion's slave, “But now himself a monarch firm and brave; “He bursts at once the ignominious chain, “Resumes the Hero, and asserts his reign. “Blest, if of nature more assur'd and free, “He'd sought no aid but from himself and me! “But, led by fraud, and arts, all insincere, “He was my foe from weakness and from fear. “His faults die with me, when his woes I view, “I've gain'd the conquest—grant me vengeance, You! “For know the work is thine, Illustrious Dame, “To deck thy Albion's brows with worthiest fame. “Let thy protection spread her ready wings, “And fight with me the injur'd cause of Kings!” Eliza then, for much she wish'd to know, The various turns of France's long-felt woe, Whence rising first the civil discord came, And Paris kindled to rebellion's flame— “Tome, Great Prince, thy griefs are not unknown, “Though brought imperfect, and by Fame alone; “Whose rapid wing too indiscreetly flies, “And spreads abroad her indigested lies. “Deaf to her tales, from thee, Illustrious Youth, “From thee alone Eliza seeks the truth. “Tell me, for you have witness'd all the woe, “Valois' brave friend, or Valois conquering foe, “Say, whence this friendship, this alliance grew, “Which knits the happy bond 'twixt him and you; “Explain this wond'rous change, 'tis you alone “Can paint the virtues which yourself hath shown. “Teach me thy woes, for know thy story brings “A moral lesson to the pride of kings.” “And must my memory then, Illustrious Queen, “Recal the horrors of each dreadful scene? “O had it pleas'd th' Almighty Pow'r (which knows, “How my heart bleeds o'er all my country's woes) “Oblivion then had snatch'd them from the light, “And hid them buried in eternal night. “Nearest of blood must I aloud proclaim, “The princes' madness, and expose their shame? “Reflection shakes my mind with wild dismay— “But 'tis Eliza's will, and I obey. “Others, in speaking, from their smooth address “Might make their weakness or their crimes seem less: “The flow'ry art was never made for me, “I speak a soldier's language, plain and free.” THE END.</field>
