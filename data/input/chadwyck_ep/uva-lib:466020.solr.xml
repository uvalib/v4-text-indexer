      <field name="fulltext">TIME'S WHISPERINGS. RIPENING MANHOOD. Have the old blossoms dwindledâis the past Become one distant ever-lessening dream, Fast-lessening like some vessel's tapering mast Seen over wide waves of the ocean-stream? Must passion's joys no more be song's sweet theme? Are all Love's tender rosebuds waxing white? And is the gold past but a silver gleam Soon to shade gently into utter night, Soon to be known but by one threadbare beam? Is such Love's piteous, unmeasured plight Now that Death's feet e'en at life's doorway seem? Are all the summers fluttering out of sight With bird-like widespread tense sarcastic wings? Is such the message ripening manhood brings? Dec. 28, 1879. ALL THE SUMMERS. Yea, all the summers! Are they all departing? Their sweet low music ripples on the blast; The tender music leaves the pierced heart smartingâ Yea, on the waves of sound our soul is cast, Remembering every blossom of the past, Recalling sacred moons long vanishÃ¨d, And summer nights whose glory could not last, And many a maiden's gentle gold-crowned head; Ah! where are all the summers?âare they dead? Where are the white dear roses?âare they gone? Where are the lush carnations that flamed red Amid their nest of stalks grey-blue and wan? O all ye sacred summers that are past, Into my farewell song your music cast! ALL THE MAIDENS. And all ye maidens who have filled with pleasure The byways and the highways of the years, Some golden-tressed, some dark-eyed with sweet treasure Of coal-black locks, now Death the loveless nears, Sing your soft silver music in mine ears Once more; and, lady of the early days, Before whose feet I cast all hopes and fears Of youth, and all my passion for the bays, List yet again to these far-murmuring lays; And let thine eyes fill tenderly, as of old They filled, when through the moonlit silent ways We walked, and watched the slow sea burn to gold Beneath the rippling flood of splendid light The soaring moon flung fierce athwart the night. MY QUEEN. Thou wast my Queen! Thou badest me achieve Fame, and a wreath of laurels for thy sake; When my sad, lonely footpath thou didst leave, Thou badest me my harp with vigour take And o'er the strings quick singing fingers shake, That so thy splendour might be known of men, And other hearts with love of thee might break, As, at thy swift departure, mine broke then. Have I not, lady, with my fervent pen, Rung thy sweet fame around our sea-girt land, Till the bright waves laughed, echoing again My tender praise of eyes, or lip, or hand? Have I not, sweetheart, since that sad, far time, Crowned thee with living wreaths of steadfast rhyme? NOUGHT. And hast thou nought, O lady of the sea, For whom I've traversed such far leagues of song, No gentle word divine to say to me, Now that, like fluttering plumes of birds who throng The leafy coverts when June's days are long, My crowds of linnet-sonnets round thy head Chant, and my throstle-poems wail their strong Lament for thee as vanishedâyea, as dead? Shall not one gracious word of hope be said? Art thou as changeful as the meadow-sweet That blooms divine one dayâthe next is shed In powdery perfumed dust about our feet? O lady, if my song be worthy thee, Speak thou one worthy, tender word to me! OLDER. Thou art older nowâthe thoughts and tender dreams Of youth have vanished, as the blossoms go At the first hint or touch of winter's snow,â Yea, when the first frost-sparkling grass-blade gleams. The old hopes rest in quiet far below The lowest depth of life's foam-flickering streams, And the old fervent passion and its glow Give place, as sunset to the moon's soft beams. But lady gentle, thou art with me stillâ We wander as of old beside the rill That fed the Esk with gold-brown moorland waters; Again we mark with glee the sudden trout, Like a red-spotted meteor flashing outâ Time's sword, for my part, no least memory slaughters. WHAT IS TIME? Ah, what is Time? To me it nothing brings But the pure sweetness of love's early day Re-glittering back on calmer sunnier wings, Wings more divine with tenfold-radiant rayâ Yea, every treasure Time would bear away Unto my soul with tenderer soul-clasp clings, And hardly even upon my lips the spray Of Time I feelâhardly its salt splash stings. O lady, in the solemn years behind I have thy figure like a love-crowned queen, Watching my course with the old glances kind, The old girl-look so tender and serene. Oh, what are sorrows of the later day, When o'er youth's meadows fell this golden ray? THY WHITENESS. O thou wast white! Beyond all earthly splendour Of utmost love thine utter whiteness shone: Moon-radiant, subtle, sweet, supremely tender, Luring with gentle might my passion onâ No singing words can all thy beauty render, It gleamed one perfect momentâthen 'twas gone! A lily waved on earth her flower-stalk slender, And seemed to smile up at me soft and wan! But thou hadst vanished, sweet, and never more Shall I set foot on that far heavenly shore; Or see thy whiteness glittering through my sleep. The lily yet I haveâbut not thy form, As for one awful moment, white and warm, It mingled into mine in rapture deep. WHEN LOVE SHALL BIND. When love shall bind at length thine errant soul, Thou shalt be mine beyond all need of song, Beyond all speechâlife's tides fast onward roll; We leave behind full many a conquered goal, Climbing fierce upward heights with footstep strong. It may be that no more my voice may sound Soon for thee, no more these swift songs abound; No more thy feet bruise blossoms in a throngâ I reach at length the poets' mountain-ground Of three-and-thirty summers when they long To pass, and do pass often, pale and crowned, Towards spheres where folly of earth no further wrong Can work upon them; let my words have weight, Spoken now ten years nearer death's sure gate. BEATRICE. Yea, Beatrice, thou artâand I thy bard, Thy Danteâyet for once within the night I may thy true name whisper with delight; And the soft cloak of poesy discard. O, truly, lady gentle, it were hard Ever to call thee Beatrice, and sing thee Disguised, remote, unknown, obscure, nor bring thee Forth to the triumph that slow years retard. Beneath the silent, awful sky of morn Vanish thou Beatriceâmy love, be born! Beneath the stars and hallowing calm of night Shine thou with her one star, a star more bright! Rose of sweet summer, lily of love's dream, Swifter than her's thine English glances gleam! ALONG THE AGES. How fair along the ages shine the flowers, Loved of the poetsâtenderly we read E'en in these modern passionless swift hours, The strain wherein great Dante's heart did bleed For Beatriceâwe mark the eager speed Wherewith his laurelled lady Petrarch sungâ Then English minstrels softly did succeedâ Came gentle Spenser with the golden tongue And the high sonnet-hymn of Shakespeare rungâ Oh, that my chanting might add one flower more, One blossom whose dear wholesome roots have clung To English soil, to blossoms loved of yoreâ Rich were our women-blossoms in those days, Yet eyes as sweet demand as passionate praise. THROUGH THE FAR-OFF GATES. O, wilt thou meet one day within the halls Of heaven the golden-haired, supreme delight, Whose voice through Spenser's song to the ages calls? Wilt thou, my lady of the sea-glance bright, Take 'mid those heavenly bowers thy place by right, Borne on the wide waves of my fearless singing Through time's vain-struggling armies clothed in night? To-day thy soft arms unto me are clinging, And in mine ears thy silver laugh is ringing, Lifted I am in spirit beyond all measure; Lo! through the far-off gold gates I am bringing A new-born, heaven-august impassioned treasure; I set my love, my lady of song, my bride, In heaven, at Dante's Beatrice's side. THE HIGH THUNDER. When the high thunder shakes along the crest Its lightning like fierce sanguine-tinted plumes Abide in peaceâyea, in thy valley rest. This fire of God earth's blossom-heart consumes: When through the thunderous canopy forth looms The white august unkindled mountain-top, Unscorched and laughing,âwhere the green earth blooms Far from the lightning do thou, sweetheart, stop, Nor tempt the swift forked fire to rake thy crop Of golden quiet corn,âbut let me soar Up to blue regions whence the wild larks drop Unable, even they, one blue yard more To traverseâthen the eagles' wings I'll take, And meads and creeds of earth for e'er forsake. BRIDE OF THE EAGLES. Or wilt thou dare the height, and be my bride, Bride of the eagles, loftier than the lark Upsoaring, through the tremulous bright tide Of air at dawn, or through the sundered dark Wherein the moon a red fierce floating spark Swims, and it dims the darkness round our heads,â And now far upland voices sound, and hark! Close to us seem the star-embroidered meads Through which the chariot of the four winds speedsâ Yea, thine shall be the gentle west wind's crownâ I am the wind that rustles 'mid the reeds In harsh December, shakes earth's turrets downâ Thou art the west wind, sweet, and I the northâ With wedded splendid breath we sally forth! IN LIFE, OR IN DEATH? NO ENDING. O, not for him who loves is there an ending To song, or to imagination's flight! The bow of fancy stronger grows by bending, And fiercer the poetic fiery might As death's vast sunless breakers loom in sight: More wonderful the soft thin-petalled rose That golden-centred, pink or pearly-white, Spangled about the lush green June-hedge blows;â Truly we know not where we pass to soon; To loveless lands devoid of sun or moon Or stars it may be, where no woman speaks, And never new-born passion dyes the cheeks; Therefore our lyre with double force we sweep Ere life makes way for death, and song for sleep. POETS MANY AND FAIR. For poets many and fair who came before us, Have shot their boltsâhave sung their song and passed; Their faces from the eternal heaven bend o'er us, Their voices mingle with the storm-winged blast. And we, too, swift as time our plumes can carry, Are seeking death's unlyrical dim sea; Not one by love or strength may pause or tarry; O Beatrice, death waits for you and me. How far away will all our labour seem, When men look back as to a thin small gleam Watched over multitudinous crests of foam; When centuries have passed and we shine small As stars seen through some open ruined hallâ When new feet o'er our hills and meadows roam. IN PLACE OF THEE. Yeaâwhat of England, then? What hands shall weave Crownals for lovers? or what voices sound Triumphant in the morn, or soft at eve? Round what bright brows shall lily-buds be bound? In what black tresses the red rose-bud wound? What eyes shall then outshine the shining sea? What white feet tremble o'er the grassy ground? The small white clover-blossoms still will be Strewn starlike o'er our cliff-topâwho shall stand Watching the wide sea from it, hand in hand? Whose eyes shall pierce, as ours pierced, the far foam, Yearning to travel to some island-home Beyond the fading sunsetâwho shall be Set thereon by the years in place of thee? IN PLACE OF ME. And what glad bard in place of me shall singâ Shall round the brows of what fair woman twine His tribute, be it of autumn leaves or spring Snowdrops, or dark-green tresses of the pine, Or yellow-white adhesive eglantine? What ripple of music shall the far seas hear? What tune the white waves echo line on line As o'er the old golden sands they stream in sheer Unpliant armies of approach, with clear Wide rings of foamâwhat harp-strings through the night Shall reach what woman's downbent listening ear? What window shall frame Juliet's shoulders white? What face as fair as thy faceâcan it be? Shall flash responsive to the future sea? THE SKY-GOD'S HEART. Beyond the birthplace of the purest breezes, Beyond the regions of the faintest stars, High up, till the earthly strainÃ¨d eyeball ceases To follow our flightâbeyond all chains and barsâ Beyond the scent of every gentle flower Of earthâbeyond the secrets of the roseâ Beyond love's glimmering green-woven bowerâ Beyond the whiteness of the unstained snowsâ Beyond the voices soft of man and maidenâ Beyond all rivers' tongues, all children's tonesâ Beyond the dim porch honeysuckle-ladenâ Beyond yon church's white array of stonesâ High up, high up, till thou and I, apart, Drink of the fulness of the sky-god's heart. SONG.âLIFE IS NOT LONG. Life is not long; wilt thou not come to me? Behold the sun hath sunk behind the sea, And night is whispering in yon aspen-tree, And the green leaves will glitter in the moon Ere long, and night's harp wake night's loving tune: Life is not long, Death's waves are strongâ Come to me soon! Come to me soon, O sweetheartâI am vext By sorrows bitter-winged, and sore perplextâ Let us in this life, sweet, begin the next! Is it worth while to wait the golden moon Of heaven? Oh, love me, grant me passion's boon Here while I pray, Ere close of dayâ Flee with me soon! Oh, life is briefer than the rose's day; Come, sweetheartâlo! I call theeâcome away; Duty is love with usâsin is delay; Give me thy life, thy being, hereâthe moon Will wrap the heavens ere long in one sweet swoon, Heal me and save, This side the graveâ Dwell with me soon! LIFE AND DEATH. Yea, is not life a nobler thing than death, Far nobler? Shall we wait till all is lost, Till life's frail vessel, wave-struck, tempest-tost, Sways, creaks and shivers, at the ice-wind's breath? Are there not sacred garlands to be won This side the red waves wherein sinks the sun? Oh, need we 'neath the languorous moon of night With idle fingers weave love's garland bright? Doth not the high God lead us towards each other, Saying, âWork not onlyâlove too, while 'tis day!â Shall we the throbbing intuition smother, Which, endless, irrepressible, doth say, âTo perfect duty, love is perfect mother; Fold not your joy in harsh death's plumage grey!â SWEET LIFE. Sweet life yet lies before usâfair and wide. Oh, tarry not till every rose is blown, Yea, till the utmost grassy meads be mown, And flat the corn-fields stretch on every side. In life, through death, in heaven, be my bride, But first in life; how little can we say What waits beyond the horizon of to-day?â Sorrows, delights, vast growths of soul, untried. May I not pluck ere yet the hollow tomb Rings with my last song, one immortal wreath, Too sweet, too tender, and too pure, for death? Shall not, one night, thy spirit through the gloom Float star-winged, sayingââThy reward is here; Long ere thy petals of young life wax sere.â THE FLOWER OF MY SINGING. Wilt thou not be the flower of all my singing? It needeth, now, a sacred living queen Who may with tender apprehension lean Above the fervent scroll the years are bringing. Lo! tired I am of idly upward flinging Love-songs, love-sonnets, into empty air! Bend forward thou, sweetâlet me crown thy hair With soft song-tendrils delicate and clinging. O, let us no more move as separate souls Through the wide wintry world, but move along, Joined hands, hearts, voices, one linked wave of song That towards the waiting golden heaven-gate rolls; Make me with pressure of thy dear white hand Proudest of proud kings crowned in singing land. SOUTHERN LANDS. Oh, seek we southern lands and southern skies; Let us within the blue Italian weather Build us a bower of love and dwell together; Foolish too long, at last mature and wise. Lo! unto thy then ever-present eyes Far sweeter songs I'll sing, and tenderer, Than when the long-loved soft love-glances were Remoteâand as remote the lips' replies. Oh, fly with me across the echoing foam, To God, to heaven, to love, to me, sweetâhome. Let not the dull and unimpassioned meads Of England, where one in ten thousand heeds, Or hardly that, love's low soft-rustling wings, Longer retain thee, sweet, and him who sings. GREATNESS. Let us be great, and love, though all the world Rose up against us, shall we be alone? Then all the wide earth for one fitting throne We'll take; our wings of flight shall not be furled Till the far southern azure is our own, Yea, hills by the grey olives overgrown:â Earth's famous cities, sweetheart, we'll exploreâ Hear the blue Adriatic's lulling tone And the white-waved Atlantic's wrathful roar; Tread where sweet Keats and Shelley trod of yore, And make of many a wilderness a bowerâ Till, gladly, at the appointed wondrous hour, We reach a Paradise where each high dream To greet us in some living shape doth seem. AND DOST THOU DREAD? And dost thou dread the fool-scorn of the world, Its fool-laugh? Am not I, thy lover, here, And shall not every foe be backward hurled? Can we not, living and triumphant, steer A joyous course with not one mortal near, For are we not the spirits of the breeze Immortal, and o' the heavens crystal-clear And of the swift unconquerable seas? Have we not in us all the force of theseâ And is there any human spirit to dare Oppose the invulnerable thing we pleaseâ Are we not girt by armour of high air? Have we not this my sword of song divine, Along the serried foes to smite and shine? THY CROWN. Shall men not look back wondering, and declare âHere was one woman-spirit free and great; A woman who could utterly once dare To link her sweet unsullied life and fate Unto a poet's, and to hurl time's gate Asideââoh, shall not some far higher crown Be thine than jewels; or rich massive weight Of goldâthe future shall fling garlands down, Nor shall thy name in the shifting eddies drown; Women shall love thee; poets shall adore Thy beauty, and if these leaves I bring turn brown And wither, singers shall weave thousands more Into a chaplet that no time shall spoil, Nor any dust of desecration soil. THE STARS ARE BECKONING. Therefore, be bold. Turn not to watch the foam In boiling venturous swift swirls at our feet; Lift thou the rather all thy bright gaze home,â Yea, mark our future of high triumph, sweet, The limitless glad leagues of golden wheat Wavingâthe leagues of joyous flowery plain, The land of promise whither we retreat, Our plumes of venture void of any stain, To dwell for ever in love's pure domain: Weary I am of waiting; come thou, loveâ The stars are beckoning, and the sweet mists cling The azure-folded mountain-tops above; Awake thou firstâthen sleep thou, while I sing And touch thine eyes with soporific wing. REST. Is this not rest? Is this not sweet, O lady! After the weary years, the long sad gleam Of sunburnt, bitter life,ânow in the shady Cool house of quiet love to rest and dream? Sleep while I watchâlo! how the white moonbeam Falls on thy face and glorifies its sweetness, Till heaven-pure and soft the features seem! Ready to pass to heaven in angel-meetness: Lo! now at last the incarnate God reveals Himself, Herself, in thee; and thou dost bring The flowers of heaven in thy breath and wing, And in thy voice the voice of God now peals Forth silver-soft,âthou art ready to be slainâ Ready to die from earth, in heaven to reign. THY SPLENDID FACE. Thy splendid face and splendid body sleeping Have in them all God's gift of womanhood: Lo! as I watch thee, all my being weeping Sees all the issue of life, and finds it good. Upon how great a height my soul hath stood Now onceâupon how far a cloud-wrapped hill, Hearing God's voice bid all the wild waves rude And all their countless foaming tongues âbe still.â One we are made with the Eternal's will, Beautiful in its strength; we join our hands, And, passing fast by many a soft-voiced rill, Yea, many a sweet-voiced memory of old lands, We meet each other's eyes onceânever more Shall cloud of pain conceal the light they pour. SONG.âSLEEP. Sleep, sweetest, sleepâ Let gentlest dew of slumber Fall on thee, without number Let dreams be born and steep Thy spirit in sweet sleep. Sleep, sweet one, sleepâ Lo! I will watch and sing,â Yea, shield thee with song's wing, And thou shalt rest and reap Reward of blessed sleep. Sleep, let us sleepâ Now am I weary too, Let perfect rest renew Two spirits, slumber deep Enfold us; let us sleep.</field>
