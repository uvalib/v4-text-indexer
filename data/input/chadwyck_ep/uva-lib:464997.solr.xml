      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES Earl of Waldegrave, Ambassador Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiary at the Court of France, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Muse's Invitation; A POEM. Musis amicus, tristitiam, &amp; metus Tradam protervis in mare Creticum Portare ventis— Horat. Rise! said the Muse, and bid adieu To Worldly Thoughts! My Flight pursue! When once resolv'd to follow me, Far happier thy Life shall be, Than his, who, on a Peaceful Throne, Beholds extended Realms his own; Who boasts of Triumphs, and detains His trembling Enemies in Chains: For him shou'd rich Pactolus flow, No Bliss like thine he e'er shall know. I'll bear thee on my Wings on high Thro' the bright Wonders of the Sky, 'Midst Crouds of Worlds, and form thy Ears, To reach the Music of the Spheres. From thence with rapid Flight we'll go, And fathom all the Depths below; See all that Pluto's Kingdom yields, And tread the blest Elysian Fields With Heroes and the Bards of old, Of whom such wond'rous Things are told: Charon his Bark will not refuse, Or Cerberus oppose the Muse. We then may visit Neptune's Court, Behold the Nymphs, and Tritons sport; Make Proteus hidden Truths disclose; And pluck the Coral, as it grows. Or, weary'd with our hasty Flight, We'll seek some Promontory's Height, Whence we may view the Ocean smile; Or with a Storm the Ship beguile, While his big Waves run Mountain high, And lift the Pinnace to the Sky. Here, while the Winds and Billows roar, Secure, this Elemental War To restless Mortals we'll compare, Who, in Ambition's Tempest toss'd, Insatiate, labour, 'till they're lost. But now shou'd rising Stars invite, And Phœbe glad the silent Night, We'll haunt the Plains, where may be seen The Fairy Revels on the Green. Or if the Sun enforce his Ray, In cooling Shades we'll lose the Day, Where Dryads, Satyrs, Fauns resort, And Pan receives his Rustic Court. When Bacchus, still the Poet's Friend, His mystic Fury deigns to lend, Here often in thy sacred Trance The Forest shall appear to dance; The Thracian Hills thou'lt fancy nigh, And frantic Mænads rushing by. Th' Enthusiastic Madness stay'd, In Slumbers, thou shalt be convey'd To Helicon's inspiring Rill, Where thou may'st bathe, and drink thy Fill, Hear all the Muses in a Quire, And Phœbus, with his golden Lyre, While Venus, and the Graces meet, Our charming Numbers to repeat, Or, Hand in Hand, in measur'd Rounds, Dance to our soft, melodious Sounds. Thus wilt thou live, from Danger free, Happy with Cloë, and with me, While Mars on troubled Europe frowns, And Victory prepares her Crowns. Answer to the Muse. Pleasing Goddess, I obey! In your Fane I hang my Arms! What should tempt me, here to stay? Free from all, but Cloe's Charms, To your Summons I, resign'd, Follow with a docile Mind. Neptune's Remonstrance. Written in 1715. 'Twas calm, and Neptune on the Main With Amphitrite, and his Train, Thro' Britain's Channel took his Way; Zephyr alone had Leave to play: The Voice of Discord in his Isle He heard, and stay'd his Car awhile. From Albion what strikes my Ear? He cry'd, my favour'd Sons, I fear, Your past Contentions are forgot, Whilom so fatal, and so hot, When Civil Rage the Sword display'd, And Brother Brother's Wrath essay'd! Does no sad Memory remain Of bleeding Charles, and Naseby's Plain? To Arms again your Trumpets sound, As tho' ye trod on foreign Ground. What Havock, Mars, do you prepare? Why do ye rush, my Sons, to War? Blind, stubborn Race, as tho' I meant, When Britain, from yon Shoar I rent, Of old, by this Earth-shaking Arm, That ye alone your selves should harm! With me my Kingdom ye divide, And scourge remotest Nations Pride; Where e'er my Billows I controul, From Thule, to the Southern Pole, Your dreaded Fleets unrival'd go, Conquer, restore, destroy, bestow; Join'd by your Ships the Indies meet, And heap their Treasures at your Feet. More cou'd I grant? rash Sons unite! These Feuds your former Foes invite: Wou'd ye your ancient Lords invoke, And try once more the Norman Yoke? Are ye so weary of your Ease? Can Liberty so much displease? Inslav'd, and conquer'd must ye be, To learn in Chains ye once were free? Shou'd ye raise Alluding to the Fifty new Churches then building. Fifty Temples more, Nay, to the Church her Lands restore, What would avail these pious Deeds, If Britain by her Children bleeds? The Patriot. We'll venture all in Virtue's sacred Cause, Proud to expire for Liberty, and Laws! Thus nobly shall we fall, and, like the Sun, Set glorious, when our bold Race is run. But O vile Age! produce us, if you can, Another brave, sincere, well-meaning Man, Who of his proper Garb is not afraid, Tho' the whole World appears in Masquerade; But dares expose to all his honest Face, As fearless of its Danger as Disgrace; Whose purer Soul admits of no Allay; But spurns the Dross of Interest away; Who, unacquainted with a selfish End, Is justly call'd a Patriot, and a Friend; Who knows at once how to be Good, and Great, And joins his Fortune to his Country's Fate: Who partially maintains no Faction's Cause, And follows only, where his Conscience draws; Whose gen'rous Heart scorns to be blest alone; But for his Nation's Good impairs his own. Show such a Man, so excellent, so rare, Whose Soul is dealt out in so large a share; We then no more will absent Justice mourn; But hope to see the golden Age return! Thus Alcibiades has often said On either Side and each alike betray'd. BEDLAM. —Peccatur &amp; extra. Hor. You who like Proteus, in all Shapes appear, And every Hue, like the Camelion, wear, Phantasia, airy Pow'r! in humbler Lays We sing your Triumphs, and your Temple raise. There, far from Reason, absolute you reign, And scorn your proud unequal Rival's Chain: A thousand restless Forms around you sport, A thousand busy Dreams your Throne support; Vain Terrors your severer Orders wait, And gay, delusive Hopes attend your State. In Britain, still for some new Madness fam'd, When Madmen long had rag'd, and unrestrain'd, Near Old Augusta's Walls the spacious Seat, The wretched, wandring Lunatick's Retreat, Arose Majestic to the Founders Fame, And Bedlam, Bedlem, or Bethlem, signifies the House of Bread. Bedlam, from its Purpose, is its Name. Here every Error of the lawless Mind, The Monsters of distemper'd Thought we find, Madness in all Extremes: Serene, and mild; Where Mathematicians. Euclid's Sons run regularly wild; Where patient Chymists still their Labour ply; And where the frantick Dead supinely lie. Or loudly raving where Ambition reigns, O'er prostrate Foes, and wide-extending Plains, With Tyrants of all Kinds, and each Degree From Pedagogue to Eastern Majesty. Or the pale Wretch in one sad Posture found, With fix'd, and hollow Eyes surveys the Ground, For ever dwells on the Consuming Care, And every Thing he turns to his Despair: Now tells of adverse Fate, and fondly dreams Of troubled Oceans, and contending Streams; Or weeps, like Niobe, and weary strays O'er false, inchanted Ground, and thorny Ways; Or threatning Ghosts, arising to his View, On lonely Sands, and Shoars the Wretch pursue; Or all around a thousand Furies glare, And shake their fiery Brands, and snaky Hair. For grateful Errors some their Reason change, And in the gaudy Fields of Fancy range: Magnific to their wild, delighted Eyes Peruvian Roofs, and Parian Columns rise; Beneath their Thrones the Nile, and Ganges meet, And waft unbounded Riches to their Feet; Kind Nymphs around with gay Lyæus dance, And not one Fear invades the golden Trance, Happy till envious Art the Bane restore, And sad, returning Reason finds 'em poor. Nor here alone are these Delusions kind, Nor to our Age, nor to our Clime confin'd: Athens of old a famous Beggar knew, Who rich, and happy in Distraction grew; Loud thro' the throng'd A Haven at Athens. Piræum he commands The Trade of mighty Nations in his Hands, Till taught his long neglected Rags to own, And curse the Physicians, the first for Bedlam. Hayles, and Shadwell of the Town. Near these the sage Observer of the Skies, Imp'd with Icarian Wings, attempts to rise, The World of Lunar Nations to surprise; Impatient to possess the distant Ground, And plough the Alluding to Terra Fertilitatis in the Lunar Maps. fertile Plains himself has found. Damn'd Authors next the tasteless Age deplore; Many in humble Prose; in Meeter more. These, Phœbus, did your wholesome Laws disclaim, And fondly hop'd with Ease to purchase Fame: Here oft in sweet Confusion they excel; Or mighty Deeds in mighty Madness tell, While Seas of Crimson Gore the Plain o'erspread, “And Heaven turns pale to see us look so red. Or Nature's general Wreck they bravely dare, The whirling Globe from off its Axle tear, Hurl Worlds at Worlds, eclipse each heav'nly Spark, “While Gods meet Gods, and justle in the Dark. With you, Phantasia bright Queen of Error, unconfin'd They soar, and leave the Weight of Sense behind, Thus on your wanton Wings supinely ride, There most secure, where most they want a Guide. With you, and Art of old the tuneful Quire To Heav'n itself with Safety could aspire, Sing the blest State of the immortal Pow'rs, Their Loves, their Nectar, and their golden Bow'rs. Or else descending they the Deep explore, And thro' the World of Waters find a Shoar, Visit the Nereids crystalline Retreats, Their Groves of Coral, and their Ouzy Seats. Or farther does your restless Pow'r invite To Realms of Chaos, and eternal Night? Tuneful amidst the horrid Wreck they soar, And celebrate the Elemental War. Or in a milder Region wou'd they tread? Behold the quiet Mansion of the Dead! Silent, and fleeting Shades compose the Song, And Lethe rouls his lazy Wave along. Turn, various Goddess, turn your beauteous Face! We sing your Triumphs, you your Triumphs grace! O! cou'd you here your kindly Aid impart, And lend your animating Pow'r to Art, Propitious, as when every Grace you bring To Congreve's Art, when Congreve deigns to sing, While Echo pleas'd conveys the Charm around, And Envy's self, compos'd, devours the Sound! Yet why, tho' artless all, do we delay Your Sport, insulting Vide Horat. Ode 33, Lib. 1. Venus, to display? Unequal Forms, and Hearts you here unite; Or Nature's Laws reverse in wanton Spight, While Corydon laments his absent Swains, And slighted Sappho of her Nymphs complains. But see a love-sick Maid, with Sighs oppress'd, Shines with superior Grace amidst the rest! Romantic Tales in Heaps compose her Bed, And vast A Famous Romance. Cassandra props her pensive Head. Sigh to her Sighs, and long to share her Pains, And thus the fond, distracted Fair complains. Sprung from a Royal Race of high Renown, The wandring Heiress of an Eastern Crown You here behold! a miserable Maid! By hapless Love to endless Care bettay'd! Early my Fame to distant Nations flew, And wondring Crouds from every Nation drew, Shining in Arms for Myra's Love they vie, And many in pursuit of Myra die. Ador'd by all, one only I approve, And him, and him alone I vow to love: But e'er the holy Priest might joyn our Hands, A fatal Task my Royal Sire commands. Proud of the gen'rous Toil, the Hero goes In Quest of Glory, and our Country's Foes. Three tedious Moons his Absence I deplore, And watch, solicitous, the well known Shoar, The Way where then the brave Orlando pass'd, When these o'erflowing Eyes beheld him last. At length I vow, impatient of Delay, To find my Love, or wander Life away. 'Twas in the solemn Noon of silent Night, When guided by Diana's doubtful Light, Along the winding Coast I took my Flight. An Age o'er Plains, o'er Forrests I'm convey'd, And Wasts, where yet no human Path is made, Spells, Monsters Rage, and Tyrant's Threats endure, And Pains Orlando's Love alone can cure. Tell me, ye courteous Knights, whose gen'rous Care Protects the Injur'd, and relieves the Fair Tell me what Magic Pow'rs, what Circe's Charms, Detain Orlando from his Myra's Arms, Tell me, O, tell me this, and, O, invade The Giants Tow'rs, and free a Captive Maid! Love has a thousand more fantastic Slaves, And each by Turns a different Madness raves, Triumphant now, and now again distress'd, By Hope elated, or by Fear depress'd. Religion next, and Politicks combine, And in one friendly League of Madness joyn The wild Projector, Patriot, and Divine. Of Schisms yet untaught, unpractic'd Schemes, And Credit still to fall the Frantic Dreams. Here Cynthia, once a fam'd Coquet, retires, And burns with Manly Rage, and Roman Fires, Scorns the malicious Art, her Beauty past, And changes Love for Politicks at last. Loud from her Cell the raging Sibyl screams Mysterious Errors, and portentous Dreams; War horrid War, and Peace by turns she sings, And Bedlam with the Fate of Europe rings. For these our sacred College chiefly stands, And half our Lodgings are in Statesmen's Hands; Tremendous Croud! with various Rage possess'd, And ever more tumultous than the rest. Yet few of all the raving Herd are found So loud, as he, who wou'd be thought most sound. Pity, he cries, a sad, but wholesom Mind, A Wretch by false impatient Heirs confin'd! Bedlam, at least, one reas'ning Slave contains, And many yet without deserve these Chains: Amidst his shining Hoard Avaro wants, Hoarse Stentor sings, and bright Aurelia paints. On these let Bedlam's just Correction fall, On these and on my impious Prodigal! Not far from hence, and in obscurer Cells Spleen with her meagre, faded People dwells. A hundred Heads the gloomy Monster bears, Each Head by Turns a hundred Faces wears, Inspiring all the Train of needless Cares. Phantasia, you the deadly Pest of Yore, On Albion's Chalky Cliffs to Eurus bore: She still her Sire attends, and haunts the cloudy Shoar. Near these the Lunatick, in fond Despair, Oft to th'inconstant Moon directs his Pray'r, Sollicitous observes her Nightly Way, As thro' the pathless Heav'n she seems to stray, To her of short liv'd Intervals complains, And feels already the approaching Change. 'Twas here, amidst the Croud of gaping Fools, A celebrated Member of the Schools Pafs'd gravely on, with slow, majestick Pace, The Pride of useless Learning in his Face. Tir'd of the noisy Croud, away, ye rude, Away, he cry'd, obstreprous Multitude! Hence! your unseasonable Mirth give o'er! Or learn of me lost Reason to deplore, Profane, illiterate Herd! who joy to see Man fallen from his native Dignity. Man! Lordly Creature! for whose only Aid The Earth and all th' Ethereal Lamps were made. To these, sublime, his stately Front he rears, And Majesty in all his Form appears, And Heaven to that Glorious Form has join'd A quick, discerning, bright, capacious Mind, And plac'd him next to the Angelic Kind. The surly Lunatic, whose Cell was nigh, Observ'd the canting Pedant stalking by, And thus accosts him: Hist, Sir Gravity! When his own Form the Painter wou'd express, He seldom flatters more, or means it less. To me this Lordly Creature Man appears The empty, idle Sport of Hopes, and Fears, Flying the Thing he did but now adore, And now pursuing what he fled before; Of Nature's more unfinish'd Draughts the worst, And of all Nature's Wretches most accurs'd, If Flattery and Pride had not conspir'd To make his Imperfections still admir'd. At mighty Things he aims with restless Strife, Beyond the little Purpose of his Life; Base in Oppression, and in Pow'r severe; His Glory Arrogance; his Justice Fear: For Fear of human Nature Laws are made, For Fear of human Punishment obey'd. And his sublimest Knowledge seems design'd To prove the narrow Limits of his Mind. Some, whom, at least in Silence, all revere, Like Gods, we own, amidst the Croud appear; These, tho' they must admire, they basely hate, Or starve the Worth they dare not imitate. Yet more ungrateful Truths Mankind must own, Was Man but to himself sincerely known; But from the Dawn of Light they turn away, And fly, like Birds obscene, the hated Day; Virtues in human Vanity devise, Which human Weakness ne'er can exercise, And sooth their Wretchedness with pompous Lies. Thus Reason is their boasted Attribute, The mighty difference 'twixt Man, and Brute! The Flatterer of all, the Guide of none, And late Reflection of the Wretch undone, An Armour which in Peace for Pride they bear; But never of Defence in Time of War. A Pilot who in Calms alone can guide, Stem easy Currents, and a gentle Tide; Who, insolent, and vain, in Safety braves The sleeping Tempest, and the smiling Waves; But when strong Winds arise, and Billows roar, The idle Boaster is of Use no more, And the poor Veslel breaks upon the Shoar. Love's Progress. From the Cradle to the Grave Mighty Love does all inslave. First in Miss, and Master's Brain He begins his idle reign: Nymphs, and Swains, and purling Streams, Rival Knights, and rival Queens, Dreams of Pleasure pure as they, (Symptoms of approaching Day) In their dawning Fancies play; Wishes, which in forming dye, Tender Sighs they scarce know why. Sighs, at length, awake Desire, Love becomes a raging Fire, Strongly seizes every Part, Warms the Blood, and wounds the Heart. Vows to wounded Hearts give Ease; They profess, believe and please: Happy, might they here have stay'd! Soon, believing, they're betray'd: Prudent, cou'd they yet give o'er! Each betrays a hundred more, Still believing, or believ'd, Still deceiving, or deceiv'd, Till, at last, the roving God, Squeamish, whimsical, and odd, Flying from each empty Vein, Triumphs in the Head again. To Aminta wounded. 'Tis just, Aminta, you are paid For all the cruel Wounds you've made: The Bee with arrow keen, tho small Has on your Lip reveng'd us all. No wonder with their dazzling Light. Your Eyes deceiv'd the Wand'rer's Sight, While, by your Breath inform'd to steer, Some fragrant Flow'r it fancy'd near. It rages! but how faint the Smart To that of my tormented Heart? O, let me heal the Wound! O, joyn, Afflicted Nymph, your Lip to mine! From what, Aminta, do you fly? No Danger in my Kisses lye: An humbler Aim I mean to take, And heal, and charm the wound I make. Resist no longer—now, I swear, Your Articles are too severe! The Insect paid but Life, of me You ask yet more, my Liberty. To a Spider, making its Web upon a Statue of Minerva. I Arachne, dar'st thou place thy Loom Between those chast, immortal Thighs, Where none of human Race might come, Or more prevailing Dietys? II E'en in the Quarters of thy Foe? Is she no better known than this? Away, or thou may'st undergoe Some heavy'r Metamorphosis. III Or shou'd she in her Wisdom find, To pour a Deluge from before, Or blow a Tempest from behind, Thou, and thy Labours were no more. To Geron So prudent, and so young a Wife! Old Geron, thou art blest for Life. So kindly careful of your Health; So close a Steward of your Wealth; Still railing at th' expensive Town; Fond of your Seat, when you are down; At home in London before Nine, And ready Dress'd at Noon, to Dine; Tho' blooming, fair, belov'd, a Prude, To Beaux, and Coxcombs almost rude. I cannot, happy Man! conceive, What the illnatur'd World believe, That all this Care she's pleas'd, to take, Is not for her old Geron's sake; But for those Twenty Thousand Pounds, Rich Jewels, and new purchas'd Gounds, Unsettled yet by Deed, and free, That you may leave to her, or me. Written on a Glass of Tokay Had e'er Anacreon, or Flaccus But tasted of divine Tokay, They had ador'd Hungarian Bacchus, And cast their Chios Wine away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Hymn to Venus. I Venus, favour my Desire! You the raging Heat inspire. Hark! a femal Step I hear! See the bright Corinna near! See the Nymph whom I admire! Venus, ever kind, and just, Goddess, still in you I trust. II Hail! Corinna Child of Love, Sent by Venus from above, Tender, blooming, full of Charms, Welcome to a Lover's Arms: All that's mortal Bliss we'll prove. Venus, you these Raptures give, Who can greater taste and live? III Venus, subject of my Lays, Goddess, still I'll sing your Praise, And, in this dark, silent Grove, Sacred now to You, and Love, To your Name a Temple raise: Ceres with gay Bacchus joyn'd There their Altar too shall find. II. Hymn to Venus. Occasion'd by some late Persecutions. I Goddess of the Cyprian Plains, Where, in Ages blest, and free, Willing Nymphs, and happy Swains Own'd your great Divinity! II While, to idle Mars resign'd, You indulge his softer Fire, Lo! your Matrons, whipt, and fin'd, At your slow Revenge admire. III Still shall Impotence, and Age, Under Virtue's rigid Face, Nature's Laws, and yours ingage, And your sacred Rites disgrace? IV While, like hunted Thieves, at Night Your poor, trembling Vo'tries meet In some wretched Garret's Hight, Or some Cellar's vile Retreat. V Venus, haste; exert your Sway, Leave your God, and golden Bow'r: Heav'n and Earth did once obey Cytherea's mighty Pow'r VI Where are all those Altars now, With a thousand Offsprings crown'd, Where no Mortal paid his Vow, But your Aid propitious found? VII Rise! o'er hated Foes prevail! Lest your former Glories seem Or some drunken Bedlam's Tale, Or some wanton Poet's Dream. III. Hymn to the Goddess of Silence All Hail! O awful, sage Divinity! Goddess of Silence! hail! eternal Pow'r, Who knowest how the Universe was form'd, How Nature first began! for thou wast then, And startedst at the dread, creating Voice, E'en then thou wast, and still thou wilt endure, When wearied Time, and Nature, are no more; At Desolation thou again must start, And the vast Globe shall fright thee with its Fall. Thee, solemn Being! venerable Queen! Whose Charms the busy Vulgar never know, Thee the wise Ancients justly did revere, And Temples to thy Name devoutly raise. Thee, Goddess! thee, at the still Noon of Night When all is hush'd, delighted, I adore, And the pale Moon is witness to thy Rites. Thee, pleasing Deity! the Sacred Nine, Daughters of Jove, the blest Pierian Maids Pursue, and find thee oft in inmost Groves: On Rocks remote, on shady Banks they meet Thy kindly Aid, while Phœbus ever young, Immortal Phœbus wakes his golden Lyre; Thy tender Ear can brook the heav'nly Sound: Thou'rt Friend to Music, and harmonious Verse; For tho' thou shun'st the noisy, loud Resorts Of restless Man, resounding Palaces, The clam'rous Camp, and dire, tumultuous Field, How awful yet o'er crouded Theatres Dost thou preside, when Johnson's manly Scene, Shakespear, or moving Otway warms the Stage? O thou, propitious to the tuneful Quire! Where'er thou dost reside, receive my Vows! Whether in Deserts wild, or Woods remote, Where yet no Path is made, nor Echoes rude Frighten the Dryads from their lov'd Retreat; Or whether, lonely, thou delight'st to stray At Noontide on the solitary Plain, While Flocks, and Herds, and all the rural Rout Of Nymphs, and Swains are hid in cooling Shades; Or is the Gothic Temple's gloomy Isle, The dusky Cloister, or dark Cypress Grove Thy lov'd Abode? Or dost thou choose to haunt (Hard by old Memphis, and the fabled Nile) The empty Vaults of lofty Pyramids, Vain Monuments of antient Ægypt's Pride? Or, haply, farther from the World remov'd, On Pindus' Top, or Atlas' hoary Crown, Or some vast Promontory thou dost stand, Whence scarce the angry Ocean is o'erheard, To lash the hollow, far-resounding Shoar. Where'er thou'rt found, great Pow'r, vouchsafe thy Aid! Deign visit our Retreat! the sacred Muse, The sacred Muse with me your Help implores; Of War, and Sports by turns we mean to sing, Of mighty Heroes, and of mighty Love. In vain the God of Numbers doth inspire, In vain Apollo's Sons attempt to soar Without thy Influence. Come, Goddess, come! Bring with thee Quiet, Contemplation, Poetick Visions bright, and Dreams sublime, Such as of old great Homer did inspire, Such as the Gods above themselves may dream, Still Dreams indeed; but Dreams of mighty Jove. Thus well attended, bless our Solitude! There nothing shall suspend thy gentle Reign, Save the low Murmur of a distant Stream, Except by chance sweet Philomel complains, Cloë tunes her melting Voice, and Lyre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. To Cloe Cloe, blooming, sweet as May, We must tempt Mamma away; Still the jealous Dame destroys All our Schemes of future Joys: All the Projects we have try'd, Vainly yet have been apply'd; At my Bait she now must bite, If I guess her Temper right: She shall have her Lover too; Trust me, Cloë, this will do. II. To Cloe, with an Ovid's Art of Love Cloe, as sweet as vernal Flow'rs, Lov'd Partner of my softer Hours, As Venus fair, as Turtles kind, Airy, and wanton as the Wind; That you may still more charming prove, Behold soft Ovid's Art of Love! But who, that to the Combat goes, Against himself e'er arm'd his Foes? If you are true, as you profess, This ne'er can make you; love me less; If, false, you wou'd in Art excell, 'T will teach you to deceive me well. III. To Cloe. My Cloë, still be only mine! My faithful Heart shall still be thine! As Vines around the Elm entwine, So will we meet, so closely join, And Envy at our Joys shall pine. In Gold, and Gems my Love shall shine, On the most costly Dishes dine, And drink the richest, purest Wine. Thus on each Pleasure we'll refine, Our Lives one smooth, one even Line; And when those Lives we must resign, One Tomb shall both our Hearts inshrine, One Verse record our Loves divine. IV. To Cloe Pleasing the Harbour Sailors find, Long toss'd, and blown by Waves, and Wind; In Praise wise Authors take Delight; Tyr'd Pilgrims in Repose at Night; Laura in a well fancy'd Gown; The Victor in his Laurel Crown; Drunkards in Liquor stout, and old; And Misers in their Hoards of Gold; Keen Sportsmen in the Woods, and Plains; In fleecy Flocks the rural Swains; But we, my charming Cloë, prove No Joy so sweet as that of Love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ODE I. To Cloe. I To Venus, Baccbus, and the Nine Our future Moments we'll resign, Sincerer Pleasures can we prove? Glory, and Riches we disdain, While, with the Muses, and Champagne, We fill the Intervals of Love. II Let Heroes quarrel for Command, Let Merchants toil by Sea, and Land, For Favours fawning Courtiers bend, While, Cloë, we contented live, With whate'er Fortune deigns to give, Nor fear, or wish our days may end. III And since both you, and I, and All Must Sacrifices surely fall To Age, devouring Time, and Fate, Say, can we be too much in hast To live? this very Hour we wast; The next perhaps, may come too late. IV I've heard the Muses in a Quire, I've heard Apollo's golden Lyre, Propitious in their sacred Grove. Now Bacchus waits; then hast away, My charming Cloë, while we may, Let's spend the Night in Wine, and Love. ODE II. To Cloe, on the Death of ? I You saw, my Cloë, t'other day How Phillis by untimely Fate From Corydon was snatch'd away, From Corydon, once happy, Mate. II How frightful did pale, gastly Death Sit in each Feature of her Face? So must you once resign your Breath, Depriv'd, like her, of ev'ry Grace. III That Beauty, so divinely bright, Which with such Ardour I adore, Those Eyes, that seem the Source of Light, O horrid Thought! must be no more. IV The proudest Fair, each Sex, and Age Before the cruel Tyrant fall; Like Love himself in his blind rage Indifferent he strikes at all. V Then let's enjoy the little while The Pow'rs allow, e'er hence we move: Nought can the Cares of Life beguile Like Mirth, and Truth, and equal Love. ODE III. To Death. I What sudden Damp invades my Heart O Death! who can thy Pow'r withstand? No matter! I embrace the Dart, Prepar'd, to follow thy Command; For I have liv'd! each Hour employ'd! Thou canst not take, what I've enjoy'd. II No! 'twas a false Alarm! he flys, Amaz'd, we have been found so brave, His boasted Terrors to despise, And view, unmov'd, the op'ning Grave. Go, Tyrant, range the Earth, and make Base, miserable, Mortals shake! III Visit some gouty Miser's Bed, Or guilty Dungeon's vile Retreat, There thy devouring Rage be fed! Or end th' Ambition of the Great: These dread thy Shaft! the Hero knows, Thou art, at worst, a long Repose. IV Yet we'll not call thee back again, While Cloë loves, or thus deceives Or while this generous Champagne So well the Cares of Life relieves. No! by the Desperate alone Thou'rt to be wish'd; but fear'd by none. V But since 'tis Nature's Law we fall One day by thy unerring Spear, Whene'er in earnest thou dost call, Deign, unexpected to appear, And mild as Sleep; as quick thy Stroke As Lightning on the blasted Oak. ODE IV. To Daphne. I Why, fantastic Beauty, why Grant so much, and give no more? Rather Daphne, let me dye, Scorn'd by her, whom I adore. II Still your kind consenting Eyes Mine with equal Ardour meet, While unhappy Damon lyes Fondly sighing at your Feet. III But when I your Bosom press, Tho' it pants with soft Desire, Flying from my warm Caress, Pale, and frighted you retire. IV Yet that Bliss, you fear to tast, Is the highest we can prove; And that Youth, which thus you wast, Will not always stay for Love. ODE V. To Artemisa. I I, in lonely Shades complaining, Still must love, and must not tell; You, o'er crouded Circles reigning, Laugh at Love, or hide it well. II If, indeed, you never languish, Tell me, how you shun the Dart; If, like me, you feel the Anguish, Teach me to conceal the Smart. III Say, what courtly Art in fashion Hides the language of the Eyes? Learn a simple Swain his Passion, When offensive, to disguise. IV Or will Absence quite disarm her? How shall Absence be endur'd? Can I e'er forget the Charmer? Can so deep a Wound be cur'd? V Absence yet is least offensive, Since I cannot hide my Pain; Then forgotten, pale, and pensive, In these Shades I'll still complain. VI And, while she new Wonder raises, And inslaves, where e'er she goes, Here alone I'll sing her Praises, Till some Pow'r shall end my Woes. ODE VI. Advice to Phillis. I Phillis, imprudent Nymph, forbear To squander, what you earn'd so dear, While in old Geron's Arms you lay. Time swiftly flyes, and on his Wings Ruin to Youth, and Beauty brings, And you, like Geron, soon must pay. II Then when your darling Youth complains Of empty Purse, and empty Veins, And hints at fifty Pieces more, How will you curse Basset, and Dice, And long, in vain, to low'r the Price, Your own Extortion rais'd before. III Decay'd, and fleec'd, you'll hardly find The future Race of Fools so kind As those, your present Charms insnare: No Fops shall then around you croud; But pass in hast, and whisper loud, Our Fathers once beheld her Fair. ODE VII. Occasion'd by Phoebe's consenting. Let's sing to Cytherea's Praise, And grateful Altars to the Goddess raise: For Phœbe is at length grown kind, Phœbe, in whom all Beautys are combin'd. Methinks already in this lonely Shade, This unfrequented, pathless Glade New, sudden marks of Joy we find: The Zephyrs fan with softer Wings, The Brooks with sweeter Murmurs flow, The warbling Lark more cheerful sings; Roses with brighter Lustre blow. II. Look down, ye Monarchs, and behold A Treasure, richer far than Gold, A Nymph, thrown out in Nature's Pride, Ferm'd in her perfect Mould, And bred up, artless, by the green Wood side, Whose Heart can ne'er be bought, or sold, Who shines, without the help of Gems, Far brighter than your Diadems: With her, remote from anxious Strife, On Banks of Flowers I repose, And joke, and kiss, and quaff, and doze, And lead an idle, lazy, happy Life. III. So, Fortune, let us still be humbly blest, And we'll remit you all the rest: We want no Titles, ask no Place, Nor at high Things endeavour; He never can be in Disgrace, Who never was in Favour. Thus while the Great a thousand Toils endure, And Monarchs sweat beneath the Crowns they bear, Here in our native Shade we'll live secure, And free, as were the first created Pair. ODE VIII. To Philomel An imperfect Copy of this was publish'd not long since, by Mistake, amongst some Pieces of the late Mr. Booth.. I As lovesick Damon lay along Beneath a melancholy Shade, Sooth'd by the nightly Warbler's Song, Thus the unhappy Shepherd said, II Sweet Philomel, who haunt the Grove, Where I lament my wretched Fate, Our joint Complaint, alas! is Love, The Diff'rence of our Fortune great. III Relief to me no Seasons bring, For ever doom'd, to sigh in vain; But you, sweet Bird, who mourn in Spring, In Summer Pleasures lose your Pain. IV Already from yon bloomy Spray, Your willing Mate your Plaint returns; Already seems to chide your Stay, And with an equal Ardour burns. V Go, Philomel, accomplish all The Joy, that happy Love bestows; Obey the tender Warbler's Call, And leave poor Damon to his Woes. VI And when the next returning Year Again invites you to the Grove; Sweet Philomel, you'll find me here, Complaining still of hopeless Love. ODE IX. The Foolish Shepherd. I As at the solemn Noon of Night, Guided by pale Diana's Light, Sad, lovesick Damon stray'd, Thus on the solitary Plain The poor, unhappy, wandring Swain, In doleful Accents said. II Witness, O Moon, who gaily shine, Ye Stars, who make sad Night so fine, Be witness to my Care! I see ye rise, and set again; But find no Rest, unhappy Swain! For thinking of my Fair. III When Morn returns, I look about, In hast to find my Charmer out Amongst the Nymphs, and Swains; And if her Flock I can unfold, I'm pleas'd, as if my Crook was Gold, And blest, as He, who reigns. IV The newest Airs to her I sing, The earliest Flow'rs, and Fruits I bring, The Virgin Honey-Comb; And if, by Chance, a Sheep shou'd stray, Tho' mine the while run all away, I seek, and bring him home. V For Game I range the Hills of Snow, And beat the woody Vales below, And drain the purling Brook; And if the lovely, charming Maid Accepts the Prey, I'm more than paid With one dear, smiling Look. VI Thus do I sacrifice my Youth, My Flocks, and Herds, my Time, and Truth To an ungrateful Fair, While happy Strephon, true to none, Possesses Cloë's Heart alone, Who laughs at all my Care. ODE X. To Belinda, Upon her asking What is Love? I 'Tis strange, Belinda, you shou'd ask, To learn, what you so oft bestow! You now impose too hard a Task, And I my Weakness needs must show. II What Love is not, I know full well: Blind Mortals, when they talk of Pain, And Joys of Heaven, or of Hell, By Negatives the Theme maintain. III True Love is not that rash Desire, That sudden Start of Grief, and Joy, Which soon becomes a raging Fire, And does as soon it self destroy. IV Who call this Love, that Name disgrace, Or never felt the noble Flame: Before I saw your heav'nly Face, I too imagin'd Love the same. V No! tis a Passion so divine, The strongest Words elude our Pains, When we this Ardour wou'd define; The Image uncompleat remains. VI 'Tis what your charming Eyes inspire; 'Tis what I feel; but can't express: To know, like me, what you desire, Belinda, you must feel no less.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Belinda; On the Death of her Turtle. Cease, soft Belinda, to deplore Your favour'd Dove, who feels no more, Nor can your Grief the Loss repair; Rather compassionate your Swain, Who lives, and loves, and sighs in vain, And longs for Death to-end his Care. Written on her Glass. Behold your self, and pity me, Who languish for that Face so fair: Into my Heart cou'd you but see, You'd find the same bright Image there. Answer to Strephon O Strpehon! how useless your Counsel must prove, Who sighs for Belinda for ever must love; For thus the dread Power of Love has decreed! Who once wears her Fetters shall never be freed, On absolute Beauty an absolute Sway Is justly bestow'd, and with Pride we obey. Sent to him, as he whisper'd ? Swain, give o'er your fond Pretension! Wit's above her Apprehension: 'Tis no Merit to excell. Any powder'd Thing in Breeches, Who can make soft, simple Speeches, Pleases Myra full as well. The Disinterested Swain. While Whig and Tory clash, and jarr, These cry, we're blest! and these, undone! Which Party, Damon, dost thou hate? For neither side I can declare; Malice, Ambition, I have none. I leave the mighty Feuds of State To the Decision of the Great: To be unknown, was still my Fate; The Muse, and Cloë all my Care. Stay, take this Fable Æsop told Of the dull Ass, and Man of old, Who, when the Enemy he spy'd, Thus to the careless Creature cry'd, When Kicks, and Blows in vain were try'd. Why stand'st thou? Fool? why this Delay? Is this a time to piss, and bray? Our armed Foes are all around: Hark, how their Drums, and Trumpets sound! Stir, stupid Beast! let's haste away! Why, let them come, or let them stay, Quoth the well-meaning, lazy Ass, Good Master, 'tis not my Affair; I still must crop coarse, wither'd Grass, And my two loaded Panniers bear. The Turtles; a Fable. Say, why, Companion, thus confind, And to your Fortune so resign'd? Venus, to whom I did belong, Gave me to Damon for a Song, Where, artless, in his humble Lays Adonis he attempts to Praise. In sport by Cloë, t'other day, From Damon I was stole away: The Shepherd begs, and prays, and fain Wou'd have her give me back again; But Cloë I to him prefer, And wish, to lead my Life with her; For here I sport, and feed at Will, And think, I dwell with Venus still, On her fair Hand I sit, and eat; 'Tis she her self prepares my Meat; When I wou'd drink I mount, and sip Pure Nectar from her fragrant Lip; Then, overjoy'd, I spread my Wings, Soon as she Talks, or Plays, and Sings, But when she sleeps, I take my Rest Upon her warm, and downey Breast. Wou'd you not give, for her Caress, The savage Freedom you possess; The musty Grains which Chance must yield On Mountain Tops, or in the Field; Amidst Alarms of Guns, and Kites, Expos'd to Cold and stormy Nights? Adieu, Companion, I'll away; It may not here be safe, to stay: I own, you are a happy Dove, While you your gilded Cage can love; Yet give me still my musty Grains On barren Hills, and fallow Plains, With Danger, Cold, and storms of Wind; But let my Flight be unconfin'd.</field>

Metam Apollo, kindly looking down On Wit's Decay in this dull Town, Its further Ruin to prevent, Resolv'd on this Expedient. To Him he call'd an Emissary, Whom he employ'd to fetch, and carry; A lackquay Spirit, sent sometimes To costive Bards to whisper Rhimes, To ease desponding Sonneteer, Or twitch Lampooner by the Ear. Fantome, said he, you've now a Task, Which does no little Labour ask; 'Twill try your Skill, and Duty, more Than all your Errands heretofore: Know, I intend to make you Warden Of all the Wits of Covent-Garden, And, by that means, to give new Birth To Ingenuity on Earth. Haste then, unto your Ward repair; Assume some heavy Mortal's Air; Let your pretended Business be Retailing Coffee, Snuff, and Tea: Tuck a blue Apron by your Side; Pots, Cups, and Kettles strait provide, With all your necessary Ware; Put leave their filling to my Care. Your Water daily will I bring From Helicon's inspiring Spring; Bards shall no sooner taste, but Sing. From thence e'en Ideots shall grow wise, And they who scarce cou'd Spell, shall rise At once, to Write, and Criticise. Dunces shall lay out Tragic Plots, And Comedies be penn'd by Sots. Songs, Madrigals, and all that Train Of lesser Infants of the Brain, Spontaneously from every Head Shall spring, like Flies on Dunghills bred.

The curious Maid.The attribution of this poem is questionable.Of doubtful attribution. Obstupuit, steteruntque comæ— Beauty's a gaudy Sign, no more, To tempt the Gazer to the Door; Within the Entertainment lies, Far off remov'd from Vulgar Eyes. Thus Cloë beautiful, and gay, As on her Bed the Wanton lay, Hardly awake from Dreaming o'er Her Conquests of the Day before. And what's this hidden Charm? (she cry'd) And spurn'd th' embracing Clothes aside From Limbs of such a Shape, and Hue, As Titian's Pencil never drew, Resolv'd the dark Abode to trace, Of Female Honour, or Disgrace, Where Virtue finds her Talk too hard, And often Slumbers on the Guard. Th' Attempt She makes, and buckles to With all her Might; but 'twon'd not do: Still, as She bent, the Part requir'd, As conscious of its Shame, retir'd. What's to be done; we're all a-ground! Some other Method must be found— Water Narcissus Face cou'd show, And why not Cloe's Charms below? Big with this Project, She applies The Jordan to her Virgin Thighs; But the dull Lake her Wish denies. What Luck is here, we're foil'd again! The Devil's in the Dice, that's plain! No Chymist e'er was so perplex'd; No jilted Coxcomb half so vex'd; Thus Folks are often at a Stand, When Remedies are near at Hand! For lo! the Glass—ay, that indeed! 'Tis ten to one we now succed! To this Relief She flies amain, And straddles o'er the shining Plain, The shining Plain reflects at large All Damon's Wish, and Cloe's Charge. The curious Maid in deep Surprize, On the grim Feature fix'd her Eyes: Far less amaz'd Æneas stood, When, by Avernus sacred Flood, He saw Hell's Portal fring'd with Wood. And is this all, is this (She cry'd) Man's great Desire, and Woman's Pride; The Spring whence flows the Lover's Pain, The Ocean where 'tis lost again, By Fate for ever doom'd to prove The Nursery, and grave of Love? O Thou of dire and horrid Mein, And always better felt than seen! Fit Rapture of the gloomy Night, O, never more approach the Light! Like other Myst'ries Men adore, Be hid, to be rever'd the more. TALE III. The Judgment of Tiresias. —Placuit quæ sit Sententia docti Quærere Tiresiæ— Ov. Met When willing Nymphs, and Swains unite In Quest of amorous Delight, Which Sex does Venus most befriend, Which Party best obtains its End, Which does the greatest Pleasure prove, And taste the sweetest Joys of Love? 'Twixt Jove and Juno, we are told, This was a fam'd Dispute of old: Long the Debate with equal Strife They held, like mortal Man, and Wife: The God in Reason cou'd not yield, The Goddess scorn'd to quit the Field. At length, quoth Jove, thus rudely cross'd, His Breath, and Patience almost lost, If by your Sex's Appetite, Proud Queen, we measure, your Delight, 'Tis plain the Goddess does dispense To them her kindest Influence. Juno the Inference deny'd, And with decisive female Pride Wou'd have it still o' th' other Side. I'll lay, says Jupiter, I'm right Three Storms, with Clouds as black, as Night, Three Peals of Thunder, mixt with Hail, And Lightning Shafts, which never fail; Win 'em, and use 'em at Command Against your Foes, by Sea, or Land, For Vows forgot, or Rites neglected, My Friends of Crete alone excepted. 'Tis done, she cry'd, and Argus Eyes I stake against your troubled Skies, Those watchful Eyes so much you dread, When wand'ring from our Nuptial Bed. Enough, quoth Jove, by Styx's Flood The Wager's ratify'd and good! But who can this Affair decide? Tiresias, can, the Thund'rer cry'd: Tiresias either Sex has try'd. Tiresias summon'd, strait appears, And thus the knotty Question clears. Parent of Gods! tremendous Jove! Great Monarch of the Realms above! And you, dread Queen! in Samos known, Invok'd by Matrons when they groan, The Judgment you require, attend, Nor may th' impartial Judge offend: An abler sure you ne'er had found In Heav'n, on Earth, or under Ground; For I've done all that's done by Man, And suffer'd all, poor Woman can, Have made my self the bold Attack, And fought, like Tygress, on my back, Now press'd the Fair within my Arms, Now dy'd beneath the Hero's Charms, Still greatly blest; for what Degree 'Twixt Extasy and Extasy? And who will venture to compare The mighty Raptures, none can bear? The happy Moment is the same To active Man, or passive Dame: The Diff'rence lies, with due Submission, Not in Degree, but Repetition. That Sex, which oftest can renew Those happy Moments, still too few! That Sex does Venus most befriend, That Party best obtains its End. TALE IV. The Shades. In the Elysian Fields, they say, As Virgil crost in Homer's Way, Young Shade, quoth Homer, why so proud? You might, methinks, at least, have bow'd, Since from my Labours you have stole Full half your Book, or near the whole. Warm, little Horace, passing by, Made Homer this severe Reply. We own, Friend Virgil wisely drew, From your great Beauties not a few; But whence you thiev'd, we cannot know, Who writ so many Years ago. Anacreon, and Sappho mute Listen'd, to hear, these three dispute, And, finding good, old Homer press'd, Made up, with Pindar, to the rest. Horace, quoth they, give back our own, And let this awful Shade alone! If what you've borrow'd, we shou'd take, Think, what a naked Bard you'd make: There's little new; young Asses bray Like old. They smil'd and slid away. TALE V. The Fair Penitent. The Powers, who our Honour guard, Cannot be always on their Ward, Cloë was taught this Secret well, When into Damon's Arms she fell: The Shepherd watch'd the lucky Hour, When Venus put her in his Pow'r; The blest Occasion close pursues: The fated Nymph cou'd not refuse. But Oh! too soon the Swain was gone! When Cloe, on her Bed alone, Reflecting what she did, and say'd, And that she was no more a Maid, In these complaining Words began To mourn her Fate, and rail at Man. Ruin'd! undone! O fatal Night! O how I dread the Morning's Light! Where shall I hide my guilty Head? Far better Cloe had been dead! Why did I listen to his Tale; Why did the Flatterer prevail? These Cheeks that tempted him, I'll tear! Pluck out these Eyes! pull off this Hair! No! yet the horrid Deed is known To the triumphant Youth alone. Alas! shou'd he the Crime conceal, These Blushes must my Shame reveal! O lov'd Companions of the Plain! Chast Virgins of Diana's Train! Forgive!—Ah! no; the Maidens pure Polluted Cloe wont endure! O curs'd Mankind! detested Name! O Love! dire Foe to Woman's Fame! Cupid, who all the while stood by, Appear'd, and made her this Reply. Young, happy Nymph, dry up your Tears! Dispel your Anger, and your Fears! Learn, these blest Moments to improve! You're but a Novice yet in Love. Damon has kindly set you free; Diana's well exchang'd for Me! The Fruit was ripe, nor long cou'd stay; It must have drop'd some other Day; Better thus early, than too late: What's done, was so ordain'd by Fate. TALE VI. The Apparition. Visa mihi ante oculos, &amp; notâ major imago. Virg. The Guardian Pow'rs are ready still, To keep the honest Man from Ill; For, as by Dian's friendly Ray To Cloe's Arms I took my Way, To Cloe, ever kind, and gay, Close by the Mansion of the Fair, Whose easy Chains with Joy I wear, I saw, Syrisca's Ghost appear. How chang'd from her, whom we of late Beheld, accomplish all her Fate, A Martyr to the common Cause, A Victim to too rigid Laws! Majestic now she seem'd to stand, Her quondam Fasces in her Hand, With Leaves, and Blossoms spangled o'er, Tho' Rods of wither'd Birch before. Not Venus self on Dido's Coast Cou'd more refulgent Glory boast, When to her Son, a while conceal'd, At once the Goddess stood reveal'd. Trembling with Fear, amaz'd, oppress'd, And pale, the Phantom I address'd. O say, departed Matron, say, Why we again that Form survey? Why from Infernal Realms you rove, Or leave th' eternal Bow'rs above? What Wealth conceal'd, what Debts unpaid Disturb your venerable Shade? Nor Debts, she cry'd, nor Wealth conceal'd, To rightful Heirs to be reveal'd, The Business of each common Ghost, Call me from th' illustrious Post, Where under Venus I command, Distinguish'd in the Paphian Band. For you alone, a Guardian Spright, I travel thro' the Gloom of Night; However rais'd, I cannot grow Unmindful of old Friends below: Fly then, lov'd Mortal, or ingage A surly, illbred Cuckold's Rage; The charming Cloe you adore, The willing Nymph is free no more: From Winds, and Waves, all Dangers past, Rough Triton is return'd at last, Caresses now his wanton Spouse, And half believes her faithless Vows, Jealous, as Heroes of their Fame, And watchful, as the am'rous Dame: Shun the late hospitable Gate; One gentle Tap proclaims your Fate. Prostrate I fell, and, O kind Shade, What Thanks, said I, shou'd here be paid! What's the Reward of Love so true, What to immortal Friendship due? Now by those Rods you still confess, Those Emblems of your late Address, Pow'rful as Love to pain, and please, Inspiring as Cantharides, E'en by those sacred Rods I swear, And by your now Ambrosian Hair, If on the Muse we dare rely, Syrisca's Name shall never dye! With Flow'rs your Shrine shall still be crown'd, And Midnight Brawls your Praise resound. TALE VII. The INDIAN. A Priest in Mission went from Spain, The blind Americans to gain, Gravely converted, bad, or good, All the poor Savage Souls he cou'd; His wild Parishioners confess'd, Absolv'd, exhorted, marry'd, blest; Labour'd, to let his Converts see, How far enlighten'd Man might be By Faith, and Books of Saints inspir'd, And preach'd, till either Side was tir'd, On moral Virtue, Sin, and Grace, Expounding all Things in their Place. A sly bold Savage, hard of Heart, Beckons the holy Man apart. Father, your sacred Truths are clear; Your Morals just, and sound appear; I here embrace them for my own: I'm puzzled at one Thing alone. My Son, your Doubt;—I must confess, Father, I'm at a loss, to guess, How 'tis, each Pair of human Kind You here in Marriage Bonds have join'd, Become one Flesh, as you ordain? My Son, give Ear, the Case is plain. Hold, Father, first I fain, wou'd see, Why I, who ever have been free. And whom you Lord of all declare On Earth, in Water, and in Air, Shou'd yet be forc'd, to take a Wife For better, and for worse; for Life; Keep all the Children, she provides; Renouncing all the Sex besides? The Father, staring in his Face, My Son, you yet are void of Grace: The Devil baffles all I say! The Savage sneer'd, and ran away. TALE VIII. The Escape. In Naples, famous for Delights, Where the soft Air to Love invites, Strephon, o'ercome with Wine, was led, By chance, to some vile Strumpet's Bed, In the lone Suburbs, where she lyes, Fatal, as Spider to the Flies. At Night, when all was hush'd, she rose To stab the Youth, and seize his Cloaths; But, as she meant, to give the Stroke, Her lifted Hand with Horror shook, A Trembling seiz'd her Limbs all o'er: A Dread, she never felt before! And, as he slept by her false Side, Thus the relenting Syren cry'd. Awake! awake! and fly with Speed, Lest by this fatal Steel you bleed! Many fond Lovers here have lain, Many this murd'ring Arm has slain; But you are safe: Arise, and go! Remorse for the first Time I know. Of some Divinity above, Or Phœbus, or the Queen of Love, You surely now must be the Care Thus strangely to avoid my Snare! No! base, rapacious Mother, use Your loudest Threats, I'll now refuse! Let her try all her Rage and Spells! My soften'd Heart, at length, rebels. Hence, favour'd Mortal! while you may, Before th' approaching Dawn of Day; Diana lights you on your Way. Fly, to convince the World, you find A Harlot once sincere, and kind! TALE IX. Zephyr. Zephyr one Day, unlucky Wind! To old Philemon's Tail confin'd, Struggled, and bounc'd, like mad, in vain, To frisk in open Air again. Swell'd with his Rage, Philemon struts, And to his Dame the Question puts. Good Baucis smil'd at what he said, And shook, in Scorn her aged Head. Nay, I'm in earnest, and in haste Philemon cry'd, the Time we waste, Baucis obeys, tho' she disdain'd. Th' unequal Foe: Philemon strain'd; While Zephyr, breaking Prison, flies, And all this Rout in Thunder dies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cupid recruiting. From Paphos I'm flown, by my Mother's command, To raise new Recruits for the Goddess's Band. To Venus's Standard the Sex I invite; Our Pay's ready Mony; our Service Delight. Come, all ye gay Nymphs, who are blooming, and fair, Leave your Blushes behind, to her Colours repair! All you, who love Pleasure, and ha'nt wherewithal To flirt at the Play, or to frisk at the Ball; All you, who by Parents, beyond the twelfth Year, Are kept in Submission, vile Bondage, and Fear; All you, who no Offers of Marriage have found, And, like mellow Pippins must fall to the Ground; All you, whose slow Lovers have promis'd, to wed, And then from their Words with Dishonour have fled; All you, whose old Spouses are gone to decay, Grown jealous, or cross, or are out of the way; Come, in your clean Linnen, and strip'd for the Fight To H-y—d's, or W—d's any Hour of the Night! The Alarm. What is't, good, prying Friend, you say? A Hair or two just turning Grey! Quick, Boy! for the next Barber send; This Sight my Cloë may offend: I'll pass for Twenty five, no more, Tho' I have seven Lustrums o'er. Go, tap the oldest Cask of Wine; Invite those merry Blades to Dine; Bid Arrigoni bring his Lute; And brush my best, embroyder'd Suit! This mighty Hurry, Friend, forgive; Tis Time, to be in haste, to Live! Apollo, and a Poetaster. DIALOGUE. Apollo. Shame to Parnassus! why for Bread With Rhimes wou'd you prophane the Dead? Poetaster. His Lordship was intomb'd last night; What harm his Epitaph to write, Or with an Elegy to wait At his sad Widow's lofty Gate? What can I do? I have no Meat: I needs must Rhime! for I must Eat. Apollo. My Lord, I own, was wise, and brave; But leave him quiet in his Grave. You ask in Alms my sacred Fire; In Charity shall I inspire? Go, seek some fitter Trade to live: This vile Affront I'll ne'er forgive! Poetaster. Homer cou'd Write, tho' he was Poor, And beg in Verse from door, to door, Apollo. 'Tis granted; but he never writ In spite of Nature, Sense, and Wit; But to obey the Muses call, Kindly invited by us All. Still stupid, profligate, and poor, Turn Pimp, or Bully to a Whore, Jailor, or Hangman; but forbear, With great Apollo thus to war! Minerva, and an Author. DIALOGUE. Minerva. Author, your Productions seem Like a sick Man's troubled Dream; Neither Middle, Tail, or Head; Stole unfinish'd, cold, and dead. Author. Goddess of fine Arts! forgive! I've no better Trade, to live; And must suit my stupid Page To the Genius of the Age: This, I'm certain, will go down, Get me Money and Renown. Pallas, read this long Essay, Made in a short Winter's Day; And this Book I sweat, to Write, A whole Summer's sultry Night; Nothing now but these succeed: None my finish'd Labours read. Minerva. From the Garret, Cellar, Plough Authors I'll excite enough: Crouds of Scriblers shall prevail, Rise, like Mushrooms, thick as Hail! Ægypt's resty King of Yore Ne'er was plagu'd with Vermin more, Than they shall the Town torment, Till these tasteless Rogues relent, Till I am ador'd, and see Captiv'd Arts, and Nature free. To Neptune, in a Tempest. I Neptune, whose Trident shake the Ground, Why all this mighty Rage to those, By whom your Altars still are crown'd? Why are we treated like your Foes? II The Trojan Race we never knew, Who did your Godhead once beguile: No! We are Britains bold, and true, Free Natives of your favour'd Isle. III Then Neptune, let our Pray'rs prevail, Nor with our Ship thus rudely sport: Send Zephyrus to fill our Sail, And safely guide us to our Port. To Love. ‘Twas in that Month which follows May, (I never can forget the Day!) When first I gaz'd on Phœbe's Eyes, When first my Heart became her Prize In Sighs the tedious Summer past: We cheerful Autumn saw at last; But still I sigh'd: rude Winter came; In Frost, and Snow I burnt the same: Now Spring returns; still, still I burn! When, Love! must Phœbe have her Turn</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPISTLE I. To Syrisca. Vice-Gerent of the Queen of Love, Who with persuasive Arts remove Coy Maidens Scruples, and inspire The hardest hearts with soft Desire! Thy Aid, Syrisca, I implore! My once lov'd Phillis is no more: Repair the Injury of Fate! 'Tis sad, to live without a Mate. The widow'd Bird still hangs its Wings, No longer sports, no longer sings, Till the new season brings along Another Partner in his Song. O, lure by thy inticing Charms Some fair Companion to my Arms! Give me no painted, gaudy Thing, New dress'd like Flora, in the Spring, To haunt the Park's licentious Grove, Trick'd up for adventitious Love, Noisy, and vain, affecting Wit; A Nymph admiring Fools might hit, Or eager Mariners adore, Just landed hot from Africk's Shore. Nor let my Chance, Syrisca, be Some oft-restor'd Virginity, First bought at an excessive Rate By some grave Pillar of the State. Or fallen Matron in distress, With awkward Fears, and forc'd Caress; Reduc'd to what, poor wretched Dame! Is acted ill in Want, and Shame: For Love, effeminated Boy, In Indolence, and Ease must toy, From Poverty affrighted flys, Or in the House of Sorrow dyes, May she, who shares my softer Hours, Be fresh, and sweet as vernal Flow'rs, Still gayly smiling, and excell In loving, or deceiving well! Such as, Syrisca, we are told, Thou to our Fathers wast of old. EPISTLE II. To a Friend going abroad. Tho' Matters go not to your mind; Tho' Britain you ungrateful find; Belinda false, and Fortune blind, Leave you for this your native shore, As wand'ring cou'd your Peace restore? Alas! this Toil you well may spare; You cou'd not, Friend, out-travel Care, Around all Europe shou'd you strole, Or visit either distant Pole: Tho' all her Sails the Vessel crouds, Sorrow will sit upon her shrowds, Swift as the strongest Gale that blows; And in all Climes Affliction grows: The Cure must in your self be found, In a firm Mind, serene, and sound. From the bright East whence Sol ascends, To where his rapid Journey ends, Wretches in his Carreer he sees In ev'ry Land, of all Degrees, From Monarchs to the Slave, who waits Obsequious at their lofty Gates. Yet Nature none to want design'd: Vain Man on Nature has refin'd; His fond Desires breed Discontent, The kind Creator never meant. Turn o'er our Annals, or the Page, Which paints the Greek, and Roman Age, Ambition's dire Effects you'll find, And how Excesses make us blind. Content is in the golden Mean, And Fortune but an arrant Quean: Still make the best of what you have, And you'll no longer be her Slave; But live, a quiet, happy Man, Here, or at Thule, or Japan. EPISTLE III. Reasons for not writing Satire. To R. D. Esq; Write Satires! no good, moral Friend, Whom Man's Disorders so offend! How shou'd I think, the Race to mend, When Horace, Pope, and Young in vain Of their Enormities complain? Can my low Voice e'er pierce the Croud! Alas! their Follies are too loud! Bid me go wash the Negro white, Or read without my Lamp at night: My weak Advice will not go down, Besides, I find their Faults my own: Physic from me wou'd Men endure, Who my own self cou'd never cure! But let's suppose, that I cou'd write, The World from their Offences fright, Wise, serious in earnest grow, And tell them, all they ought, to know; I still, well meaning Friend, have thought This Preaching never worth a Groat, One might as well lay down, and sleep; The Roots are fix'd, the Stains lye deep. I judge from all I've seen, or read Of Mortals now Alive, or Dead, That Vanities were still the same, And Man had still this Itch to blame. Yet might we ev'ry Folly glean, And purge, my Friend, the Lepers clean, Some think, the Cure wou'd do more harm, And that their Errors keep them warm. Better, they cry, to steal away One's Mantle in a frosty Day, Than thus inhumanly succeed: Of all our Follies we have need; Our Vanities, however great, Scarce serve us, to support our Fate: Shou'd we behold our selves undress'd No Creatures wou'd be more distress'd! For all these Reasons I refuse, To tempt, good Friend, my wanton Muse, In Satire her low Flight to prove, Contented still to sing of Love. EPISTLE IV. To B. B. Esq Friend, whether it be wrong, or right, In Verse, or Prose I needs must write; You may as well oppose the Stream, For I am doom'd, to blot a Ream, Or two of Paper, e'er I dye. Then to some Purpose write you cry; Strive to be useful: what avails, To sing of Love in wanton Tales? Do something worthy of the Age, Or for the Church, or for the Stage. Translate anew old David's Lays; Or rival Otway, Young, or Bays; Or else, in a severer Tone, Tell the mistaken World their own. Suppose you back some Party's Cause! You're sure of Readers, and Applause. My Friend, I never cou'd take Pains, Still sporting in light, idle Strains; I'm Stranger to all State Affairs, And leave Ambition to my Heirs; Satire, I've too good Cause to hate, Nor have I Patience to Translate: What e'er I send you, is my own. So much the worse, you say, and frown. EPISTLE V. To C. F. Esq Whether the French, ally'd with Spain, Or German Troops the Battle gain; Whether the Bards, in former Days, Writ better than our modern Bays, What matters it to us, my Friend? Shall we in vain Enquiries spend Our Moments, as they ne'er wou'd end? While rapid Time drives on our Hours, your Claret in the Country sow'rs. When at your Villa shall we dine, And taste your rich Hungarian Wine? The russet Autumn now has past, And Winter, since we saw it last. Once more the teeming Spring we prove; Kind Nature calls for Mirth, and Love. Your Groves no longer bend with Snow; Your thaw'd Canals, and Fountains flow: Yet think, when Age the Blood congeals, No second Spring the Body feels. Say, sweet Cuzzoni, shall I bring, With Rival'd Philomel to sing? Or will you ask the Sisters fair, And Laura, with her auburn Hair? But let not Mentor be your Guest; His Politicks will damp our Feast. EPISTLE VI. To Dr. P? at T. W. with ? While you the Sick to Health restore, Like your Hippocrates of yore, On Thames's Banks I court the Muse, Blest, when her Aid she don't refuse, And, careless, no Ambition prove, But humbly thus to Sing, and Love; Not wishing, what I can't possess; Content, cou'd Fortune give me less, So I your Friendship still may share, And fancy Cloë true, and fair. When I my artless Lays impart, You show your Candour, and your Heart, To all my Errors just; but kind; Rather to Praise, than blame inclin'd; Indulgent, tender; yet sincere: I need a Critick more severe. Lay by the palliating Friend; I only ask Advice, to mend. Say, am I truly now inspir'd, Or with delusive Ardour fir'd? Hid from my self, I want your Light; 'Tis you, my Friend, must set me right; Resign'd before my Judge I stand, And wait Correction from your Hand. The God of Med'cine, we are told, Apollo's skillful Son, of old Wrought Wonders; but with all his Art, He only reach'd the mortal Part: Your Talents are not so confin'd; Phœbus his Pow'rs in you has join'd: You make th' afflicted Body Whole; You can inform the Poet's Soul. EPISTLE VII. To ? Concerning Travel, and Education. —Tali Auxilio— Tempus eget— Your Son near eighteen Years of Age, Too tall for School, or a Court Page, (Tho oft your Neighbour, his good Grace, Promis'd his Godson such a Place, Sets out: no matter; you have Friends, And something better Ned attends At his Return from foreign Land, Where now he's sent by your Command. He's gone; but, with an aching Mind, To leave his darling Hounds behind; The weary Task performs in haste, And thinks his Time, and Labour waste, Impatient, restless, and in pain, Till he can hunt at home again; Remembring nothing that he sees, But Rivers, Steeples, Hills, and Trees; For how shou'd the raw Country 'Squire A Taste for the fine Arts acquire, Or Rome, or Raphael's Hand admire? His Tutor, a meer Scholar bred, With College Mutton duely fed, Stranger to all Fatigue before, Consents to post half Europe o'er, And guard the Lad from foreign Vice, Lewd Women, Popery, and Dice, So that your Parish be his Prize, When the good, old Incumbent dies; All his Ambition a good Stock To plough Church Lands; a docile Flock; A fruitful Spouse; a House, that's clean; Perhaps in Time to be a Dean: With Thoughts like these, all Tongues unknown, But Classic Latin, and his own, He went, and grudges all his Pains, Till Cam or Isis he regains. This Mentor, this Telemachus, For one another fitted thus, In all the Inns where they have lain, The wish'd Politeness needs must gain. Thus, while retir'd with your good Wife, You lead a frugal, Country Life, And mortgage Farms for ready Pelf, To keep young Master like himself. The Youth in Search of Knowledge goes, And ev'ry Road exactly knows; Learns how wild Boars the Germans take; What Fishes fill Geneva's Lake; Each Prince, or Post-Boy that he meets Can name, and all the Paris Streets. This is the best you must expect; For, shou'd our Guard his Charge neglect, Things may go worse,—the 'Squire suppose At his Return without a Nose; Or forc't on Marriage to some poor Coquet, or cast Venetian Whore; Or to a Coxcomb from a Clown Improv'd, 'twill add to his Renown! Had it not better been to stay, And Educate the good, old Way, With solid Learning store his Mind From Books, he left unread behind, The Structure well contriv'd within, Th' external Ornaments begin; Nor, like a vain, fond Architect, A gaudy Frontispiece erect, And all the useful Rooms neglect, Thus when he came indeed of Age, Grew curious himself, and sage, You might have chose your Heir to send Abroad with our experienc'd Friend, Who, like Ulysses, has been out Some Years, and rang'd the World about, To read Mankind, their Manners know, Nor Vice's Slave, nor Pleasure's Foe: Of Him he might have learnt to live, And form a Taste—but you'll forgive. The dark'ning Age declines apace: With Tears I think upon the Race Our future Progeny must breed, And fear, our Grandsons will not read. EPISTLE VIII. To ? After receiving a Present of Wine. Pamper your Steed with Oats and Beans, The Creature guesses strait it means, That for some Journey you prepare, And neighs aloud, and snuffs the Air. Or take your Gun in Hand, and say, Hy to the Woods! and cunning Tray Will wag his Tail, and know your Heart, Spite of the Doctrine of Des Carte, Who writes, that barking nothing means, And that all Beasts are mere Machines. As shrewdly, Friend, did I divine, When Tom, your Butler, brought the Wine, You meant it, to inrich my Brain, And take it out in Rhimes again. Unless to mend her Milk, who leads His Straw-fed Cow to flow'ry Meads, Or fattens her, when old, with Clover, But hopes, to sell her to the Drover? Nought in this Age is done for Nought: E'en Votes, like Verses, now are bought; Honour, and Freedom may be sold, And Ilia be had for Gold. 'Tis just, good Friend, you have your Will: The Chymist sure may use his Still. Evaporated, not refin'd, Thro' the Alembic of the Mind, Behold your Drink!—nay, never curse! My own dull Port had turn'd out worse. EPISTLE IX. To S. W. Y. From the Country, in Answer to some Verses. While I, as Faunus us'd of old, The awkward, rural Nymphs pursue, Who sometimes kind; but oftner cold, Now hugg, and kiss; now scratch, and scold, And make me black, and blew. While thus in Ditch, or under Hedge Of Love we give the surest Pledge, Expos'd to Wind, and Weather, May you, and bright Lavinia play On Velvet Couches all the Day, And toy at Ease together! Still may the charming Nymph inspire New Vigour, new Poetic Fire, While we the tuneful, happy Swain admire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONG I. Forbear, God of Love, torment me no more! Enough I've endur'd, give your Tyranny o'er! Still must my fond Heart be for ever the Prize Of Cloë's, or Daphne's, or Phillis's Eyes? Must every Beauty, and every Grace For me have a Charm? must you haunt ev'ry Place? In Country, in Town; in the Park, at the Play You lead, mighty Power, my Fancy astray. Of all the deep Wounds you e'er gave me before, None deeper than this, since I Phœbe adore: Men say, thou art blind; but, alas! can it be? For still I am wounded, and she's ever free. Since then it is plain, you ne'er shoot in the Dark O God of desire! be coy Phœbe your Mark! The Pains, she despises so much, let her know, That once she may feel, what her Slaves undergo. SONG II. I Silly Nymph, no more Airs I desire, Nor think with that Face to trepan: Time has rifled your Eyes of their Fire: You must hope never more for a Man. II Yet, as Age hurries on, you grow proud, Gay, airy, coquetish, and smart, Still ogling, and talking aloud, And wou'd fain make a Slave of my Heart. SONG III. I Envy not the mighty Great, Those pow'rful Rulers of the State, Who settle Nations as they please, And govern at th' Expence of Ease. Far happier the Shepherd's Swain, Who daily drudges on the Plain, And nightly in some humble Shed On Rushy Pillows lays his Head. No curs'd Ambition breaks his Rest, No factious Wars divide his Breast: His Flock, his Pipe, and artless Fair Are all his Hope, and all his Care. SONG IV. I Phillis, sure the Pow'rs above For our Joy did you compose Graceful as the Queen of Love, Wanton as the billing Dove, Fragrant as the blowing Rose. II Wit, and Beauty, both we find Striving, which shall arm you most: Doubly, Phillis, thus you bind; Had not Nature made you kind, We, alas! were doubly lost! SONG V. I Attend, ye coy Maidens! of Love is my Song, And Phœbe the cruel, reform'd in a Dream, As in a sweet Slumber she lay all along In the midst of her Flock by a murmuring Stream II Now by Chance or Design arch Cupid was nigh, And pleas'd, a sad, desperate Lover to save, His Dart at this barbarous Beauty let fly In Favour of Damon, her amorous Slave. III “Soft Dreams, cry'd the God, come, and melt her hard Breast, “And may the fond Shepherd, poor Damon succeed, “Who watches, all Night, by her Rigour opprest, “And tends, all the Day, on her Herd in the Mead! IV Soft Dreams in a Moment croud into her Head, She fancy'd rude Colin, that ugly, old Swain, Caress'd her so long on a Violet Bed, That she woke with the Pleasure, yet blush'd with Disdain. V Then, stretching, she cry'd, yet o'ercome with the Joy, If Colin, in Dreams, can so gladden my Heart, Farewel to my Frowns, I'll no longer be coy, What Bliss, while I wake, must young Damon impart? SONG VI. To the Tune of A famous Vaudeville. I. When I was a Lover, How I whin'd, how I cry'd, How I sigh'd, how I dy'd, All to flatter her Pride? For in vain still I try'd By all my Arts to move her. II. I treated, presented, went finely array'd, Spent my Time, and Estate, While I early, and late For my Sentence did wait, 'Till quite tir'd of my Fate, Thus to the God of Love I pray'd, Humble a haughty, cruel Maid! III. Love heard my Petition, And strait, mov'd by my Smart, His kind Aid did impart, To recover the Dart, That stuck deep in my Heart, And sav'd me from Perdition. IV. Then free, when I laugh'd at this Beauty so coy, Tho' so long us'd to reign, To frown, and disdain, She herself wore my Chain, And she sighs still in vain; So let her still sigh on, blind Boy! While I my Freedom still enjoy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chiron to Achilles. —Res est sever a Voluptas. Old Chiron to his Pupil thus began, When he beheld him rip'ning into Man. Accomplish'd Youth! well worthy of my Pains, You now are free, and guide your self the Reins: Yet hear, Achilles, hear, before we part, A few, short Precepts from a faithful Heart. What tho' the Gods a Nestor's Age deny? Let Management a longer Life supply, And learn, at least, to live, before you die. A little Tract well Till'd, more Profit yields Than Realms of wild, uncultivated Fields. 'Tis not from length of Years our Pleasures flow, Nor to the Gods alone our Bliss we owe; Our Happiness, and Pain depend on us: Man's his own good or evil Genius. Great Ills by Art we lighten or remove, And Art our meanest Pleasures may improve: Much to our selves is due, tho' much to Jove. Think not, young Prince, your elevated State, Birth, Honours, or the empty Name of Great, Can fix your Joys! they're ill secur'd, unless You know your self, to form your Happiness, Which in the Shepherd's humble Hut is found, While Palaces with Discord still resound. Fortune to Industry is ever kind, And, tho' by the blind Vulgar painted blind, Is still more equal than the Croud suppose, Who judge of Happiness by outward Shows; She smiles on all Conditions, each may be A Man of Pleasure in his own Degree. Yet few with Art their Happiness pursue, Tho' all Mankind have Happiness in view, And ev'ry Sense seems made by Nature's Skill For giving Pleasure, and avoiding Ill. Nature, our common Mother, has been kind, And for a Race of Joy her Sons design'd, Who long to reach the Goal, yet lazy lag behind; Or wholly blind, or doubtful how t'advance, They leave the Work of Industry to Chance, And of those few who with more active Strife Pursue this great, important End of Life, Some too impatient, know not how to wait; Or aim at things beyond their Humane State: These last thro' too much Delicacy fall And, by refining, rob themselves of all. Shun then, Achilles, shun the Faults of such, Who still propose too little, or too much. Stretch not your Hopes too far, nor yet despair; But above all, of Indolence beware. Attend to what you do, or Life will seem But a meer Vision, or fantastick Dream, Pass'd in Ideas of Delight at best, While real Pleasure's lost in doubtful Rest. In short, learn when, and how to bear; in vain He Pleasure seeks, who is afraid of Pain; Pleasure's a serious Thing, and cheaply bought By Labour, Patience, Management, and Thought. But you, aspiring Youth, by Nature seem Addicted to an opposite Extreme, Impetuous, and restless, soon inflam'd, And, like a gen'rous Courser, hardly tam'd; In all things violent: but, O! disdain, Brave Prince to let usurping Passion reign, In one rash Moment sacrificing more Than Years of sad Repentance may restore. As Thracian Winds the Euxine Sea molest, So Wrath, and Envy, from a Humane Breast Drive Halcyon Peace, and banish kindly Rest. And no Security for Joy is found, But in a Mind that's tractable, and sound. Suppress the first Emotions of your Ire, And smother in its Birth the kindling Fire. Ere Anger yet possesses all your Soul, Ere yet your Bosom heaves, and Eyeballs roll, Think on the useful Precepts, I have taught, And meet the rising Heat with wholsom Thought. Or seek the sacred Muses with your Lyre, Who with sweet Peace to lonely Shades retire, Gods, and the Sons of Gods, the Heroes sing, While Hills and Vallies with their Praises ring, These learn to imitate, and Those adore, And sweetly to your Self, your Self restore; Music, and Verse, and Solitude controul Impetuous Fury, and compose the Soul. For this, I early taught you how to sing, And form'd your Fingers to the trembling String; For 'tis not all sweet Pleasure's Paths to show, The Arts of Consolation Man shou'd know: Our Joys are short, and broken; and in vain To constant Bliss wou'd Humane Race attain: Be oft' contented to be free from Pain. There is a Deity ordain'd by Fate To damp our Joys immoderately great, That none on Earth from Sorrow shou'd be free, But ev'n our Blessings taste of Misery. If Fortune gives, what rarely we obtain, An equal Share of Pleasure, and of Pain, Our Portion is o'er paid, the rest you'll find But fond Ideas of the wanton Mind, Which now vain Scenes of Godlike Pleasure shows, And now creates imaginary Woes. When sad, your Ills examine, and compare, Judge of your own by what another's are. Consider greater Wretches, and the Fates Of mighty Heroes, and of mighty States; Thus real Evils in their proper Light Appear, the false thus vanish out of Sight. Nor aim at Pleasures difficult to gain, Choose rather such you may with Ease obtain. Who scorns to trifle, is by Pride abus'd: I pity him, who ne'er can be amus'd, But, slighting Pleasures moderate, and small, Must live in Rapture, or not live at all. Great Pleasures still are near ally'd to Pain: Who quits the peaceful Shore, and ploughs the main, Big Waves, and mighty Tempests must sustain. Let not such fond Ambition to be blest, The humbler Pleasures in your Pow'r molest; Yet cherish Hope; for without Hope there's none: Taste Hope! but be not fed with that alone. Some their whole Lives in Expectation spend, As Life were not begun, or ne'er wou'd end, Fondly from Day to Day themselves deceive, Not living, but intending still to live, While they neglect the Joys, they might possess, For empty Dreams of future Happiness. Let Nature in your Pleasures be your Guide, Nor suffer Art her genuine Charms to hide: Her Beauties with unweary'd Eyes we see; The Truth of Beauty is Simplicity. Live not by Imitation, servile State! Nor on the Fashion for your Pleasures wait, Man otherwise so selfish, and so proud, Submits his Taste to the fantastic Croud, And lives not for himself: do you pursue Your own Desires, and to your self be true. As Bees extract their Sweets from ev'ry Flow'r, So you your Joys, from all things in your Pow'r, With Industry and Management produce: The meanest Trifles are sometimes of use. Yet know well what you do, and when 'tis done, Nor at all Hours to ev'ry Pleasure run; But mix with Art your Pleasures, and your Toils. For Pleasures have their Seasons, and their Foils Thus when the earliest dawn of Eastern Light Proclaims the finish'd Empire of the Night, Haste to the Field, Achilles, nor disdain, To chace the foaming Monster o'er the Plain, Or teach the untam'd Steed to feel the Rein; Or let your Car, and Arms your Nerves prepare, Or for Olympic Games, or future War: Then whether Arts, or Glory fire your Mind With Thoughts more generous, or more refin'd, Aurora to the Muses still is kind. At Noon, a simple short Repast be made; A shorter Slumber in the cooling Shade: What's gay and light, th' unbended Mind employ, Or Sports, or past Delights, or future Joy. But when the Ev'ning-Star begins to rise, When Phœbus' fainting Steeds forsake the Skies, Still chearful at the well-spread Board be found, Amidst bright Friends, and with fresh Garlands crown'd, While Wine, and Thais with her Voice and Lyre, Banish old Sorrows, and new Joys inspire. Thus when from Toils of Empire you are free, Nor Camp, nor Council claim your Liberty, The Morn to Labour, and the Muses give; At Noon with Temperance, and Quiet live; Ceres', and Bacchus' Gifts at Ev'ning prove: Divide the Night with Somnus, and with Love. Thus, thus, Pelides, drive your Cares away, Nor feel the Evil, till the evil Day. What tho' on Simois, or Scamander's Shore, Far off from Home, the Greeks your Death deplore? No matter where, or when; it once must be, And nothing can revoke the firm Decree. Tho' Thetis' Son, tho' third from mighty Jove, Eternal Monarch of the Realms above, Nor Jove, nor Thetis, can your Days recall, Or for an Hour defer your destin'd Fall. Mean while, a looser Rein to Pleasure give; Time flies in haste, be you in haste to live: Seize on the precious Minutes, as they fleet; Your Life, however short, will be compleat, If at the fatal Moment you can say, I've liv'd, and made the most of ev'ry Day! One Precept more I fain wou'd recommend, And then old Chiron's tedious Lessons end. Learn, gen'rous Prince, what's little understood, The Godlike Happiness of doing good. How glorious to defend, and to bestow! From nobler Springs can Humane Pleasure flow? A solid Good, which nothing can destroy, The best Prerogative the Great enjoy. For this remember, Monarchs first were made, For this, young Prince, be lov'd, and be obey'd, At once your self, and mighty Nations bless, And make Humanity your Happiness. But now Aurora ushers in the Day, And fond, expecting Peleus chides your Stay. Go then, brave Youth, where'er the Fates may call; Live with Design, and fearless wait thy Fall. Whatever Space of Life the Gods decree, Thy Name is still immortal; for I see More than another Peleus rise in thee. Thy Fame the Homer. Prince of sacred Bards shall fire, Thy Deeds the By Alexander, who had Homer's Iliad always with him, proposing Achilles for his great Example. Conquest of the World inspire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPITAPH I. On Mr. A. H. a great Traveller. From Orcade Isles to Ægypts's Coast His Travels Sauny still wou'd boast, And lov'd about the World to roam. Howe'er, at the last Trumpet's Sound He promis'd, he wou'd here be found, And tarry quiet now at home. EPITAPH II. On Delia. Here Delia's buried at Fourscore: When young; a leud, rapacious Whore, Vain, and expensive; but when old; A pious, sordid, drunken Scold. EPITAPH III. On Mrs. Beata F? Stay, Youth, and o'er this Marble weep, Where now alone, and fast asleep Beata lies, poor Sinner! Alive, so tempting, so resign'd, She ever charm'd, yet spar'd Mankind The Time, and Pains to win her. EPITAPH. IV. On my Lady? Beneath this Marble lays a Load Of Earth, which once was Flesh, and Blood, Warm'd with a Spirit strangely prone To hate all Notions, but her own: Her Person fair, of moderate Size, Her Mind, as moderately wise; Not very dull, nor mighty smart; But hated Wit with all her Heart: Not very silent, nor a Scold; Extremely chaste, extremely cold, Loyal, and pious to Excess, And truly bumble in Distress, She liv'd in Fear, and dy'd in Hope, Renouncing Satan, Whig, and Pope. EPITAPH V. On?? Timon of London here is laid, Who was a close rich, testy Blade: Lest any Mortal, now alive, Shou'd by his mighty Treasure thrive, 'Tis by his Will to Heirs convey'd, Still to be gotten, born, and bred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Providence. Plato, and Socrates were not So happy, as the empty Sot, Whose Vanity still pleads his Cause, Who never doubts, or makes a Pause; But firmly thinks that best, he has, And smiles at ev'ry Thing, he says. If Hamor finds, his Voice is good, His wretched Daubs well understood; If Bays will ne'er suspect his Wit, Spite of the Hisses from the Pit, Must it not fairly be confest, Whate'er we think, that these are blest? Thrice happy Fools! whose bare Pretence Supplies the Want of Excellence: And who, tho' Nature gave ye none, Can stamp Perfections of your own, Which, like base Coin in some poor State, Passes at home. O equal Fate! Philosophers deduce, from hence, The Mildness of your Providence; For shou'd you let these Coxcombs see Their naked, true Deformity, They'd break the Mirrour, like the Ape, Who Started at his filthy Shape. To a Friend, who turn'd Roman Catholic upon Marriage. Strange Force of Beauty to controul The Mind, and catch the sinking Soul! Fond Proselyte! you plainly prove No Jesuit can preach like Love, Nor all the Doctors of Sorbonne E'er do, what Laura's Smiles have done. Phillis waking. I Who wakes me from a Dream of Love? Whose gentle Whispers do I hear? Whence comes the balmy Kiss I prove? Who sighs?—my Strephon sure is near! II What panting Bosom presses mine? Who kills me with Delights unknown? 'Tis Strephon, or some Pow'r Divine! Strephon! it cou'd be thee alone! ÆNIGMA. Soft Dream of Virgins! happy Matron's Pride! You Peace restore, you Empires can divide, More powerful than Friendship's sacred Tye, Riches, Ambition, or Philosophy! Tho' blind, yet bold; tho' dumb, you teach to speak, In Action strong, and thro' your Triumphs weak; Eager, as hasty Torrents, when controul'd; When unresisted, whimsically cold. That you are just, your very Foes agree, Partial to neither Sex, and no Degree; But visit both the Wealthy, and the Poor, And knock, like equal Death, at ev'ry Door. Nor do you swell, vain glorious, with Success; But, after Conquest still retir'd, and less, The Hero, and the Sage at once confess. ÆNIGMA. Vile Instrument! but useful still; A Damp to Joy, a Guard from Ill; Scorn'd by the Bold; by Sages priz'd; But, when most friendly, most despis'd. As Monarchs, in Intrigues of State, Are forc'd to trust the Knaves they hate, And, when the dirty Work is o'er, Regard the sordid Tools no more; E'en so, when thou hast serv'd our Turn, We cast thee forth, or let thee burn. To S. D? Had I the Eagle's piercing Sight; The rapid Dove's unwearied Flight: Cou'd I my Love to love excite; Like her receive, and give Delight: Cou'd I be secret as the Night; Convince all Parties of the Right; For ever quell my Foes in Fight; Dare, all I cou'd; say, all I might; Like you, renowned Poet, write; I then shou'd be a happy Wight! To two young Ladies, who retir'd to live together. What strange Device is this ye've made, The Bonds of Hymen to evade, And drive alone a sep'rate Trade? Mourn then, ye Beaux, mourn every Swain! The Arts of Love ye Learn in vain: The Fair are to the Fair grown true, And Beauty does it self subdue! To Daphne. Daphne, you'd fain be cross and rude, And Pass in earnest for a Prude; Still calling on the Pow'rs above, To hinder you, from what you love. Fond Self-Tormentor, 'tis in vain! You was not born for Virtue's Chain! Your heaving Breast too well reveals The Struggle which poor Honour feels. So ill you act th' affected Part, With so much Truth, so little Art, That 'tis meer Folly, to delay What you must grant another Day. L'Allegro. Hail, Comus, God of Feasts! severe Minerva shall not enter here. Who wou'd be sage, since Fools are blest, For ever smiling, and caress'd? Hence, Doubt! curs'd Reason's worst Disease! Ridiculous Desire to Please! Pale Diffidence, and modest Shame, Be gone! we'll not be Slaves to Fame For an uncertain, empty Name! Philosophers! who Learning prize, And hold, 'tis happy, to be wise, Why in vain Arts wou'd ye excel Since Ignorance will do as well? Why all this Labour to succeed, These needless Pains, since 'tis agreed, That thoughtless Hamor's empty Brain Affords him, what ye'll scarce obtain From all these Books, on which ye pore? Believe me, never Trust them more, And give your fond Inquiries o'er. Far better 'tis like him to pass Your cheerful Mornings at the Glass, And doat upon an ugly Face. Throw by these Volumes! spread the Board With all the Elements afford! Bid Cloë, blooming Nymph, advance, To lead, with Smiles, the sprightly Dance, And lot the useful Follys reign, Ye strive so madly to restrain! They cheat Themselves, who wou'd be Grave; Seneca was a wealthy Knave, His Morals a proud Stoick's Tale: Self-Love, and Pride can never fail. Who wou'd his Vanities redress, But steals from his own Happiness, If to true Wisdom ye'd aspire, Implicitely your Selves admire! This, Friends, is to be wise, and blest! Meer Imposition all the rest. Then welcome, Comus! bring along Your Torch, and serenading Song; And shou'd the Fair refuse to rise, We'll force our Way, and seize the Prize.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPIGRAM I. O Love! what Pains do I endure? Have Patience, Swain, they'll soon be pass'd, Your very Passion bring its Cure, Since all Philosophers assure, Nothing that's violent, can last. EPIGRAM II. Come, throw your idle Rhimes away! Get something for a rainy Day. Alas! my Friend, bid T-l-nd pray; Teach Cork to sink, or Time to stay! EPIGRAM III. You think, in yon inchanting Dome, Cupid, and Psyche have their Home: Alas! my Friend, 'tis no such case. Draw nigh, and hear the Strife and Din, My Lord, and Lady have within, You'll swear, Love never knew the Place. EPIGRAM IV. Corinna dies for Grief; but still She frets, her Weeds are made so ill. EPIGRAM V. Yet in a Sling you bear your Arm? The Duel, Friend, was close, and warm, Nor is my Wound so very slight. Good Captain, do your Honour Right! 'Tis all Pretence, your Foes declare, And that this Scarf you only wear, That you may not be forc'd, to Fight. EPIGRAM VI. Do, what you can; say, what you will, You must be curs'd, and hated still, In spite of Fortune, Sense, or Wit; While Florus, profligate, and vain, Without the least Pretence, or Pain Does ev'ry Mortal's Fancy hit. EPIGRAM VII. Phillis, I a Plot discover! You have taken a new Lover: For his Comfort I can tell, Let him use you ne'er so well, You will change him for another. EPIGRAM VIII Collin, for Love expiring, crys, To see the Nymph, before he dies. She went in Pity, 'tis confess'd, She went; but deck'd in all her Best. EPIGRAM IX. Why Doctor, cure that pleasing Ill? He had been Mad; but Wealthy still: He feels, and owns he now is poor. Better for Gripus do as much, Who starves, yet is afraid to touch The useless Hoards, he keeps in store, EPIGRAM X. Tho' your Boy Charles ressembles John, Your Nose is short, and his is Long, Why can't you see his Merit? Must Ned, who han't a Grain of Wit, But Like, as you the Child had spit, Your whole Estate inherit? EPIGRAM XI. Hermit, who with Contempt look down From yon high Mountain's barren Crown Upon the leud, licentious Town! Descend, and live with us unmov'd: Your boasted Force is yet unprov'd, While in that cold, sad, mossy Cell Untempted thus alone you dwell: See Cloe smile, and feel no Wound; Brave all the Joys, that here abound, And we'll pronounce your Virtue sound. EPIGRAM XII. Palemon met me in his way, And ask'd my Counsel t'other Day. Excuse, said I, the Case is nice, I never care to give Advice. He took this flat Denyal ill, And pray'd me in Compassion still. I yet refus'd: he beg'd, and cry'd, Must an old Friend be then Deny'd? We to our selves are blind, unjust; No Man alive but you I'd trust. At length consenting, bad, or good, I gave the best Advice I cou'd: He seem'd convinc't; but since, I find, Palemon follow'd his own Mind, And thinks my wholsom Truth unkind. EPIGRAM XIII. Timon, chagrin'd, and sick of Life, To mend the Matter, takes a Wife. Things still go worse: to ease his Pain, Kind Heaven took his Spouse again. Unhappy yet, he keeps a Miss; But was no better pleas'd with this. Court next, and Camp in vain he tries; With like Success o'er Europe flies; Marries once more. At length, resign'd, Observes the Evil's in his Mind. EPIGRAM XIV. God knows, Prudilla, while you pray, Which Saint you chuse, what Words you say; But what you wish, we shrewdly guess, In your Devotion, and Distress, And this beyond all Doubt we know, None of your Vows to Heaven go; For still your rich, old Aunt's alive, And you're a Maid at Thirty Five, In Love, despis'd; in Debt, and poor: An Atheist scarce cou'd suffer more. EPIGRAM XV. Titus reads neither Prose, nor Rhime, He writes himself; he has no Time. EPIGRAM XVI. In Anno Twenty, it is clear, You lost Twelve Hundred Pounds a Year: You still have left Twelve Hundred more. Yet Irus, who was born to none, And found the Means to get but One, Is rich, and blest, you sad, and poor. EPIGRAM XVII. Hamor in Six Months Time, no more, Has almost travel'd Europe o'er: Hamor must then be chang'd, no Doubt? No; he's come Home, as he went out. EPIGRAM XVIII. What has this Change in Myrtle wrought; He's grown reserv'd, and full of Thought; Looks odd, and hardly seems to know The Friends, he lov'd a while ago. I'll tell you: Myrtle has, of late, Inherited a good Estate, EPIGRAM XIX. Whence this strange Bustle, Friends, I trow, Of Tory, Whig; of High, and Low? Zeal for the Public Good, no Doubt. No; here's the Cause of all this Din; They out of Place, wou'd fain come in, They that are in, wou'd not go out. EPIGRAM XX. Why weary of a single Life? I wou'd advise you, Charles, to stay: Friend Limber marry'd th' other Day; You like his Table, and his Wife. EPIGRAM XXI. In dismal Weeds you still appear, Melissa, tho' the Time is out, And vow, your Mourning ne'er shall end: Excess of Grief, I make no Doubt, For our departed, loving Friend; Yet, since you have not shed a Tear, There are some People who pretend, It cant be Sorrow for your Dear. 'Tis true, this Dress becomes you more, Than any Thing you ever wore. EPIGRAM XXII. How chang'd my Phillis? can it be, You love so well, and only me? The pleasing Wonder I'll believe: But shou'd you change your Mind again, And doat on any other Swain, In Pity, Phillis, thus deceive. EPIGRAM XXIII. Detested Plague of human Race, Who Nature's fairest Works deface, And your malicious Rage disclose On Strephon's Shins, or Phœbe's Nose! To visit my inconstant Fair, In pity to her Youth forbear; Tho' thrice five Years she cannot count, To five Times three her Lovers mount. EPIGRAM XXIV. Plague on your dry Platonic Love; 'Tis fitter for the Blest above, Quoth Joan, still burning with Desire. I swear, quoth John, the Wench is mad! Of that same vulgar Sort we've had Enough, to quench a common Fire! EPIGRAM XXV. Sly keeps a Mistress of his own. You jest; she's kept for half the Town. EPIGRAM XXVI. Geron at Fourscore marry'd! 'tis too late. No; he but wants an Heir to his Estate. EPIGRAM XXVII. Why all this Stir at Myra's House? She took last Night a second Spouse. Then why that Hatchment, Friend, I pray? Her first was bury'd but to Day. EPIGRAM XXVIII. Why Drums, and Trumpets to excite, Dread Captain, when you go to fight, While you, and all your Soldiers swear, Ye never knew, what 'tis, to fear. EPIGRAM XXIX. Poor Widower! how he takes on? Alas! 'twou'd melt a Heart of Stone. Her Jointure was well paid, and clear A good two thousand Pounds a Year. EPIGRAM XXX. How! cost a Week, before you made it? Yet Damn'd you say, the Night they play'd it? Your Pardon, Master Bayes, I doubt-it! You cou'd not be so long about it. EPIGRAM XXXI. Sly Dick took his new Spouse to Bed, And counted on her Maidenhead; For she was scarce Fourteen: But hear! the Zone, he judg'd so tight, Was found unty'd and loosen'd quite. What may this Wonder mean? Poor Sylvia, who had her Cue, Frighted, From his Embrace with-drew, And beg'd, he wou'd not chide: With Colin romping th' other Day, The Bird got out, and fled away; No Fault of mine, she cry'd. EPIGRAM XXXII. 'Tis strange, Prudilla, you accuse Of too much Warmth my wanton Muse, While you read on with all your Spite, And Practise, what I only Write. EPIGRAM XXXIII. Tar with Beau Fopling caught his Wife: He scream'd, and fled; she beg'd for Life. Tar saw Contrition in her Eyes, And thus the good, blunt Sailor crys. Spouse, the first Fault we may forgive; But ne'er repeat it, while you live! EPIGRAM XXXIV. Poetic Works, you say, are vain, Infants of a distemper'd Brain. What then? my Verses still you read; And I my lab'ring Mind have freed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Fatal Constancy. A TRAGEDY. Fortis, &amp; infelix, &amp;, plusquam fœmina Virgo. Ovid. Metam. To the Honourable Mrs. MARY HOWE; NOW Countess Dowager of Pembroke. PROLOGUE. Spoken by the late Mr. BOOTH. This Night we represent a modern Play, Short, plain, and simple, in the ancient Way: Instead of Ornament, and borrow'd Grace, The Unities of Action, Time, and Place. We raise no Ghosts, call down no gay Machines, Nor tempt you with Variety of Scenes: With no rich, pompous Pageantry surprise, Nor, to secure your Hands, delude your Eyes: On Thought we now rely, and hope Success From easy Words, and natural Distress. In early Ages with no Charms but these The Fathers of the Drama sought to please; By Nature Nature's Passions they refin'd, Search'd their own Hearts, to gain the Hearer's Mind, And from their own Emotions mov'd Mankind. But, O, for such a Muse, and such a Eire, As did of old the Grecian Bards inspire! While Athens from the manly Scene grew Sage, And sat whole Days attentive to the Stage. When Theatres were Schools, and the pleas'd Youth Was kindly cheated into Sense, and Truth. Then might our Author too demand Applause, And boldly trust in Aristotle's Laws, Sure to instruct, as sure to give Delight, And Art with Nature happily unite. Dramatis Personæ. MEN. Zimon, an Athenian General. Mr. Mills. Omphales, a young Nobleman of Athens, betrothed to Zimon's Daughter. Mr. Booth. Tryphon, an Augur, retain'd by Zimon. Mr. Cibber. Ammon, an Orphan, depending upon Zimon. Mr. Williams. WOMAN.Hesione, Daughter to Zimon. Mrs. Porter. A Herald, Guards, and Attendants. SCENE, a large Hall in Zimon's Villa, adjoining to Athens. Time of the Action no longer, than that of the Representation. ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Ammon. Ammon. The Shades of Night retire, and infant Day Looks doubtful in the East, the Day which bears My Happiness, or my Destruction. And you, infernal Ministers of Wrath, Ye Furies, who delight in human Ills, Hear, and attend! to no light Purpose call'd! This Day shall be the Parent of such Deeds As well deserve your Aid!—soft;—who comes there?— Tryphon! SCENE II. Enter Tryphon to Ammon. Tryphon. The same. Ammon. The same I would have met. But say, sage Prophet, why, e'er well 'tis Day, Thou'rt searching here alone for Prodigies, And ominous Portents? thou ne'er art wont So early to forsake thy easy Down, And venture on th' inclement Breath of Morn. Tryphon. Hallow'd I come, and recent from the Temple; Big with Prophetic Truth, in mystic Dreams Reveal'd e'en now before the sacred Altar. If thou art pure, approach. Ammon. Fly from thy self, If thou dost fear Pollution—I am free! Tryphon. Ammon, thou may'st repent this impious Mirth. Ammon. 'Tis now no Time of Sport. Canst thou be bold? Tryphon. Ay, in a worthy Cause. Ammon. Hast thou a free, and enterprizing Spirit, That for the Sake of doing ought that's Great, Will do't! and make no cold Reflections? If so, thou hast a Soul for my Design. Tryphon. Why this is strange! Say, is my Aid requir'd In what concerns thy Peace; or to advance The gen'ral Growth of Piety, and Truth; To dry the Widow's Tears; or to relieve The Orphan's Wants?—If thus I am of use, In brief propose thy Will: Some previous Rites To these intended Nuptials call me hence. Ammon. I am, thou know'st, an Orphan; nobly born; And a Dependent still. Tryphon. I mourn thy Fate. Ammon. The wealthy Zimon has an only Daughter. Tryphon. Which Child our gracious Benefactor gives This Morning to thy Friend. Ammon. An Heiress, Tryphon, Best on a ruin'd Noble is bestow'd, To mend the Breaches angry Fortune makes, And cleanse that Blood, Contempt, and Poverty Have well-nigh tainted. Tryphon. Hah!—no more of that! Is this thy Aim? Ammon. My Love, and Int'rest both Demand the beauteous Treasure. Didst thou not discern The Joy, I vainly labour'd to subdue, When Zimon twice, in th' Error of his Zeal, Defer'd the Rites, protracting so my Hope To this important Day!—Shall I endure To see Omphales bear away the Maid? Can I, as Friends are wont, join in the Mirth? Mix with the sprightly Dance, and Nuptial Song? Nay more; when slow, and long expected Night, When every smiling Planet to their Joy Shall call the happy Lovers, even then Shall I, with others of the chearful Throng, Unto my Rival's Bed, their Scene of Bliss, Usher the blushing Pair? Not e'en in Thought Can I support it! Tryphon. Fond Presumption! Ammon. No! You can construe Omens as you please, And either way expound the Will of Heav'n, As Inclination, or as Int'rest leads. I know thou can'st: 'Tis so thou dost delude The Superstitious Zimon, practising Upon his credulous, and easy Nature. Tryphon. Unheard-of Insolence! Am I chose out To aid thee in thy Crimes! Thus dost thou treat The sacred Seer of Heav'n, whose hallow'd Breast Th' Immortals deign to visit, and inform? Away, thou Prophanation! Vex no more My holy Ears with thy Impieties! [Going off. Ammon. No! Thou shalt hear me on, and aid me too! [Detaining him. Tryphon. Aid thee! To rob thy Patron of his Daughter. Is Zimon thus repaid? Is this the Meed Of his Protection, and indulgent Care? Had he not sav'd thee, Fate had cast thee forth To all the ling'ring Pains of shameful Want. But when thy Father fell, this gen'rous Friend Held thee an helpless Infant in his Arms, And fondly told thee—Yet thou hast a Father! So took thee home, and rank'd thee with his fair Hesione, where, like a tender Plant Plac'd on the Brink of some refreshing Stream, You flourish'd rhro' his kindly Influence. This, Ammon, is the Man thou wou'd'st abuse! Ammon. His Gifts are, as a Step-Dame's Largesses, But cold, and given with a grudging Hand: No more than to support my Misery, Tryphon. Methinks, I see Omphales too inrag'd, And ready to accuse his perjur'd Friend On thy own Head be all thy Treachery! [Going off. Ammon. I have a Lure shall bring thee back again! Tryphon, behold! this Gem contains the Sum Of all my present Fortunes. [Discovers a Jewel, while Try. turns and pauses. Tryphon. Be it so;— Thou dar'st not bribe me sure? [Approaching. Ammon. Impossible! Tryphon. I think, thou dar'st not!—'Tis, in Size and Lustre, Second to none my Eyes have yet beheld— [Observing the Jewel. Woud'st thou to any of the heavenly Pow'rs Present, and dedicate this precious Treasure, I'll recommend it with my warmest Pray'rs. Ammon. I now conceive thee—here!—may Paphian Venus Accept this Gem as Ammon's Offering! [Gives him the Jewel Tryphon. I take it, as 'tis meant! Ammon. I trust you do. Tryphon. A Sacred Off'ring to the Queen of Love, I've no sinister Ends! I take no Bribes! Ammon. To thee no Bribe; but to the Paphian Goddess! Venus, in Pity to her Votary's Pain, May blast these Lovers hopes, turn all their Signs Of Peace, and Joy to ominous, and bad, Inspiring thy Prophetic Tongue to prove, That I alone was born to bless the Maid. Tryphon. The Deities delight in Offsprings! Venus is present, and accepts thy Gift. —A num'rous Offspring, and a constant Love Shall bless thy future Days!—but this not yet! Nor is Hesione the promis'd Fair! Not Jove himself can alter Fate's Decrees! [Spoken as tho' he then laboured with the Deity. Ammon. Practise thy Arts on Fools! [Endeavouring to recover the Gem. Tryphon. O Sacrilege!— Dar'st thou retake what to th' Immortal Powers Thou'st offer'd up, and sanctify'd to Heav'n?— I tremble for thee! [Going off. Ammon. Stir! by this good Sword, Thy Fate pursues! Tryphon. Fond Man! I'm arm'd from Heav'n! Ammon. Hold!—I have yet a stronger Argument! [Recollecting. Tryphon. No more? it is not in the Pow'r of Man To tempt me! Ammon. No? nor Woman, Dotard? Tryphon. Hah!— [Discovering Signs of Surprise. Ammon. The kind, young Slave, the beauteous African, Swears thou'rt a very Paris in thy Courtship! —Is it not Death for any of thy Tribe To break his solemn Oath of Chastity? [In a threatning Tone. —Nay, blush not, nor deny it, holy Seer! You but prepar'd her for more youthful Arms! She told me all your Love, e'en from the time When you pursu'd her faultring, to the Grove, And mutter'd Curses on your aged Limbs. 'Twas then, that, lavish of your Sighs and Pray'rs, You pour'd out all your tender Artifice! Why all this Fear you cry'd, this coy Disdain! Can chirping Birds reveal? can Winds complain? Will yon, foft, murm'ring Brook our Loves upraid? Or Myrtles tell what's done beneath their Shade? The stoln Delight with me you safely prove; For who suspects the sacred Seer of Love? —Thus eloquent thou wast! then, to confirm The wav'ring Maid, thou needs must make it clear, That Vice, and Virtue are Opinions! That the Discovery only is the Crime! Till she—nay, frown not! it avails thee nought! Tryphon. [After a Pause. Ammon, thou know'st me well: and I know thee. The Masks are off, and we convicted stand To one another. Ammon. Then our wisest Course Is to secure each other's Interest. Tryphon. Grant me but one thing more, I'll follow thine Thro' all the Labyrinths of close Deceit. Thou art not now to learn our Patron's Fortunes, His endless Treasure, his unnumber'd Stores, The Gifts of Athens, and the Spoils of War; Enough to weary the most lavish Hand, And even make a Virtue of Profuseness. Nor need I tell thee, by th' Athenian Law 'Tis all Hesione's Inheritance. Ammon. Enough! I can imagine thy Request. —Now, by the equal Powers who preside O'er mortal Contracts and revenge their Fraud, I swear! and thus confirm the Oath! [Giving his Right Hand, according to the Grecian manner of plighting Faith.]—succeed, The Fourth of all her dowry shall be thine. Tryphon. No more! I'll call up all my Artifice! —Behold! the Morning gilds th' Athenian Towers. Zimon will soon awake, and bless the Day. Then will I fill his Superstitious Mind With holy Scruples, and religious Fears; Invent new Prophecies; confound the old; Be wond'rous dark and doubtful— Ammon. And in haste: Matters of this Consistence must not hang. Tryphon. The very Banquet, If I aim aright, [After a Pause. Made for thy Rival's Nuptials, graces thine. Ammon. My Soul will labour for the wish'd Event! Tryphon. Fear not! the Man we purpose to deceive, Thou know'st by Nature moulded to our Use. Hast thou forgot what in the Front of War Th' Enthusiast did, when either Host prepar'd, In dreadful Silence stood; 'twixt Foe, and Foe A narrow, but an horrid Interval! While Ruin in a thousand threatning Shapes Ruin oppos'd; and grinning Death o'er all Shook his dire Shaft, impatient for th' Alarm, To let loose all his Furies, and commence The wild Destruction? it was at that time That Victim after Victim madly fell By his own Hand; for still in vain they bled, Nor promis'd to his Arms the wish'd Success: When suddenly, behold! th' impatient Foe Rain on our Host a Storm of missive War. Yet wou'd he sacrifice? None daret'advance, He cry'd, till Heav'n commands! our Ranks grew thin; Reluctant, unreveng'd th' Athenians fell. At length the Omens of Success were found, Then strong with double Fury, on he led His conquering Army! his devouring Sword, Thus licens'd from above, and edg'd with Zeal, Fell keen, and heavy on the Persian Pride! Ammon. Such is the Force of superstitious Fire! Tryphon. But why to thee need I unfold the Man? 'Tis Time I practis'd on th' Enthusiast. Farewel; thy Rival comes! Ammon. Smiling in Hope! Tryphon. Why smile thou on him too: meet Smile with Smile, And safely in the Form of Truth deceive. [Exit Tryphon SCENE III. Enter Omphales to Ammon. Ammon. Welcome from Athens! this good Morning's Hopes Have brought you early to your Happiness. [Embracing him. No longer be the promis'd Bliss delay'd! May every Omen now propitious prove, And every Joy that Hymen can bestow Reward Omphales Truth! Omphales. Thou'rt ever kind! Ammon. So be the Fair you love! Omphales. Possess'd of her. Not Jealousy it self might doubt my Bliss. O Ammon, she was made without Allay! Perfection's fairest Pattern! Ammon. So compleat, That you alone are worthy of the Maid. All Greece shall joy to see Omphales blest: Unenvy'd you shall call that Beauty yours, Her Wealth, this happy Mansion too, your own, This lov'd Retreat, which proudly from its Height Looks down on Athens as it wou'd contemn The busy Croud, and frown on the vain World: Is, and is not of Athens. Omphales. O, my Friend! Name not those Trifles with Hesione! From Beggary, and Want! e'en from the Chains Of Slav'ry I had ta'en her to my Arms, And glory'd in her Smiles! when thou art told, I doat with Fondness never known before; Am dead to all Delights but those she gives, Her Arms my World, Her Bosom my Retreat; Yet think me Just! it shall be strange, indeed, When thou'rt forgot! were Fortune in my Pow'r, Thou shoud'st outshine thy glorious Ancestors. Had'st thou Ambition, it might serve thee now: War threatens us; (but thou'rt a Slave to Ease) War is at hand, and calls our Youth to Glory. Ammon. I thought the World at Peace: th' Athenian Arms Hang idly up, and rust within our Temples. Whence is this Storm? Omphales. It blows from Persia. Th' Invaders, like a Deluge, come upon us, Exulting in their Barb'rous Multitude, And pompous War. It is not yet abroad: This Morning will unsold it to the State. Ammon. Zimon will head our Pow'rs. Omphales. Most certainly: His Name's a Terror to the Persian. Thrice has the daring Chief o'erthrown the Foe. O, cou'd he but as well himself subdue; His only Error! turn but from that Side, And thou may'st look with Wonder at the Man! By Heav'ns, it galls my Heart, when I behold These Prophets lord it o'er a gen'rous Spirit! I tremble at their Pow'r! our common Cause, The Fate of Greece it self is in their Hands! Under their Omens we go forth to War, And with their Omens sheath the Sword in Peace; For them we conquer; for the holy Drones Batten upon the Harvest of our Toil, And laugh to see our Labour!—fain I'd learn, Which was their Hour of Danger; or the Time When to themselves they prophesy'd of Ill! But this is not enough! they now become Our private Guides, and rule our inmost Souls! Influence every Circumstance of Life! Our Reason; nay, our very Passions too They wou'd inslave! and we must love, and hate At their Direction!—Insolence, and Craft! Ammon. Delays have vext thee! I'll engage, at least, For Tryphon's Faith! Omphales. No more; the Time draws on I'll in, and at the Altar see perform'd What previous Rites th' Athenian Law requires: I wou'd not seem remiss in Duty here. Come! thou shalt witness to my Offering. Then with a Bridegroom's Joy I'll meet the Fair, And in her Arms elude all future Care. [Exeunt. The End of the First ACT. ACT. II. SCENE I. Zimon, and Tryphon. Zimon. An awful Dread, a Parent's fond Compassion Contend within me— and this midnight Dream— Tryphon. No airy Dream of Chance! not vainly bred Of midnight Vapours, and unkind Repose; But with Lustrations sought, and Sacrifice! Presented at the Time when no false Dream Deludes the Sense; in the last Watch of Night, While on the Victims Skins I slept before the Altar. The Priests, who in the outward Temple held Their solemn Vigils, say the Pavement shook, The Altars groan'd, and strange amazing Sounds The while re-echo'd thro' the vaulted Dome— The dreadful Interdiction too resounds Still in my Ears, like the low, murm'ring Noise Of distant Thunder. Zimon. And will Heav'n divide A Pair which Nature seems herself to join? A Pair whose Loves have from their Childhood grown, And strengthen'd with 'em? Tryphon. Yet the Gods are just!— Let us consider well of this Design, E'en from its Birth. Now twice the full-orb'd Moon Has wasted, since our first Attempt was made; And now the third sends forth its Influence, Propitious held to Hymen's Votaries. Think, when the first appointed Day was come, And the young Pair before the Altar plac'd, How suddenly the Sun withdrew his Beams, And vail'd him from the Sight, while Night in Clouds Seem'd to return in haste upon the Morn. How Jove from forth the wat'ry Stores of Heaven Pour'd down a second Deluge on our Heads; Nor ceas'd his livid shafts of sulph'rous Flame, Nor ceas'd his dreaded Voice 'till we retir'd! Zimon. The Day was horrible! Tryphon. Again the Moon Grew to her highest Pride: fondly again Thou did'st presume! for what, alas, avail'd Thy Hecatomb, and pompous Sacrifice? Think how unwillingly the Victims fell; How they were dragg'd into the holy Place. How, when the Intrails were explor'd, in one The Heart was sought in vain, and from the next A stench of foul Corruption issued forth: How from the sacred Altar, Clouds of Smoak, Black as Tartarean Vapours, roul'd around, And hung like Night upon us: nor aspir'd The Flame towards Heav'n; but, dividing, seem'd To steal, as in Disdain, from what it fed on. Rank was the Incense, and the holy Wine Imbitter'd as with Gall: with these compare What now has happen'd. Urge not Heav'n too far! But rather thank th' indulgent Pow'rs, who deign To lighten up our dark, uncertain Ways. Heaven, the tender Parent of Mankind, At first informs us gently, and in Smiles; But with an heavy Hand Correction comes, If we neglect the kind Admonisher. Zimon. May not repeated Sacrifice avail? Not the pure Vows of the unspotted Maid? Tryphon. Then know'st thou not, that tho' all Heav'n combine, To turn the steady Course of Fate, 'twere vain? —Yet when I reason with my self, 'tis strange, [After a Pause. That you, my Lord, who are the very Head, Or, as it were, the Helm of this Design, Shou'd find no private Information; (As oft it happens on the like Occasions) Nor yet are self-instructed from above; Nor from within, by Doubts, Misgivings, Fears, Involuntary Motions, such as seem Impos'd upon the Sense; nor from without, By Objects, or confirming Accidents. Zimon. Now, Tryphon, thou awak'st my Memory, Which Age, and a long Care for Athens' Good Have worn to frequent Slumbers. Some Days since, As thro' the solemn Cloifter of the Temple, And round its hallow'd Grove, where awful Shade And Silence teach us Adoration, All bent on Heav'n, I took my wonted Way; A sudden strange Emotion fir'd my Soul; I grew enlighten'd, and the Book of Fate, Methought, was opening to my Mind: When, lo! Forth from the Thicket rush'd a monstrous Boar, The Terror, and the Tyrant of his Kind, In Horror, and in Size surpassing far All that our Attic Mountains yet have bred. He stop'd! e'en in my Path he stop'd!—I paus'd! He glar'd awhile, and, foaming, as in Rage, With hideous Yells betook him to the Forest. Tryphon. How? glar'd he on thee? Zimon. With an Eye of Death As tho' we had encounter'd in the Chase, And with my Spear I had fix'd him to the Earth! Tryphon. And came he on the Left, my Lord? Zimon. He did. Tryphon. O, how industrious are the pitying Pow'rs, To guide aright the wand'ring Steps of Man! Think! has ought else occur'd?— Zimon. The other Morn, [After a short Pause. As tow'rds the East I bow'd my self to Heaven, Begging Success on this our Enterprize, A lonely Turtle on the Left I spy'd. Tryphon. The social Bird of Venus, and alone? This boads a Separation? or by Death, Or what is worse than Death, Domestic Jarrs. Far off be all such Strife from Zimon's Walls! Zimon. I know thou lov'st me, know thou fear'st the Gods! Tryphon. So fearing, I obey their Heav'nly Wills. Zimon. 'Tis plain thou dost—but oh, ye awful Pow'rs! How to the tender Maid may I make known Your harsh Resolves? how tear her from his Armes? Oh, 'twill be worse than Death! a Love so true! So deep ingrafted in each other's Heart! Oft have I mark'd with Joy their growing Passion, And thought 'twas happy! first in Infant Smiles It broke, and strengthen'd into Sighs from thence; Sighs almost made in Ignorance of their Cause: At length Maturity awakes Desire; They Hope, they Fear; they Vow, and call it Love. And now to part! in reach of either's Arms! Cut off, divided at their Noon of Hope! Tryphon. Alas 'tis hard! but Sense of Duty sure Will mitigate the Pain. Hesione Knows what is due to Heav'n, and to her Sire: Early you painted to her tender Mind The Monster Vice in all its ugly Forms; The flow'ry Paths of Virtue next you drew, And peaceful Innocence: she was all Ear: Her happy Disposition met you Care, And half prevented your Instruction. Zimon. True, my good Tryphon! but so great a Tryal! So difficult a Task for Patience! Tho' nurs'd amidst the Horrors of the Field, Bred in Alarms, and intimate with Danger, I'm not so ste el'd against Compassion, That I conceive not what such Lovers feel At such a Separation: nor has Age So sower'd my Nature, that I wish not Youth Its innocent Desires—nor can'st thou feel A Father's Tenderness. Tryphon. A Father's Love Shines clearest in the Duty of a Father! Shall Man, shall narrow-sighted Man declare, This is my certain Path to Happiness? Here will I tread? but that I'll surely shun; For Danger, Care, and Pain are ambush'd there? When even then the kind, indulgent Pow'rs Expose the wildness of his fond Desires, And Thunder loudly tells him, he is wrong? —Then let all-knowing Fate provide no more! Zimon. Mistake me not! I am not all subdu'd: The Will of Heav'n is fervent at my Heart! Had yet th' all-equal Pow'rs been more severe, And to their Altars doom'd the spotless Maid; Destin'd her Virgin Blood a Sacrifice To the sad Manes of th' unburied Foes This Arm has slain—shou'd I with-hold my Child? Nay more was this her Parent's Sword decreed Death's sacred Instrument—shou'd I yet pause? Withdraw my Hand, and spare the beauteous Victim? Tryphon. No! in Compassion thou wou'dst Sacrifice! Nor meant I ought to thee: but there are some, Shou'd even the Guardian Goddess of our State Minerva's self from her high Heav'n descend, And in th' Athenian Streets declare her Will, Yet some, I fear, there wou'd be found, to close Their impious Ears against her loud Commands! Zimon. If any such there be, forgive 'em Heav'n! Tryphon. Heav'n is forgot! our Altars are grown cold! Zimon. Behold my Daughter! Joy, and Innocence Bloom in her Face. Alas Hesione, Thou know'st not yet how near thou art to Pain! That the rich Robe, gay Hymen's Livery, Which, foil'd by thy own Lustre, fades upon thee, Now only serves to decorate thy Sorrows. SCENE II. Enter Hesione to Zimon, and Tryhon. Welcome; O welcome to thy Father's Arms! [Embracing her. Pledge of my youthful Love! thou fairest Flow'r, Which with a Planter's Care I still have guarded, Cherish'd, defended from invading Storms, That when my Winter shou'd draw on, when Age Shou'd sadden all things to me, thou alone Might'st bloom, and flourish in my faded Eyes, And smooth the last, sad, rugged Stage of Life. —O may'st thou yet, yet answer all my Hope! Hesione. Doubt you Hesione, whose grateful Heart Ne'er knew a Wish, that came not first from yours? Zimon. O, gaze not on me thus! but rather turn, And hide thee from me—Oh, Hesione! Say from thy Soul, hast thou not ever found me Kind to thy Will, and yielding to thy Pray'rs? Hesione. Ever! and a whole Life of duteous Love Will poorly recompence your tender Care. Zimon. Can'st thou be rigid in Obedience? Hesione. Duty, and Love stand ready to perform, Whate'er my Father's Justice can command. Tryphon. You think the Gods are just, Hesione? Hesione. Let all my Actions testify I do. Tryphon. Heav'n grant they may! Hesione. Then I am doubtful still. Say, my lov'd Father, I conjure you say, Whence are these Sighs? why heaves your gen'rous Breast? Zimon. Think! canst thou bear the Storms of angry Fate? Canst thou thy self subdue? and hast thou learnt Of Patience ought besides its empty Name? Hesione. With you the worst of Fates I cou'd endure! Shou'd it please Heav'n, at once to pull us down Even unto the last of Miseries! That Bondage, Sickness, Poverty, and Shame Might seize upon us all, your Name, and House Expung'd for ever from the Book of Fame! E'en then Omphales, and Hesione Cou'd least forsake you. All the weary Day, Tho' threaten'd, scorn'd, we'd beg for your Support; All Night by turns secure you in your Sleep, And with our wretched Weeds from the cold Dews Defend your reverend Head. Zimon. Excellent Creature!— Thou art alas! too tender for thy Fate. [Aside. Tell me, Hesione, when thou hast heard Some moving Tale of unsuccessful Love, Some sad, disastrous Story, full of Woe, Of tedious Absence, Pain, and Sufferance; When, thro' a strange variety of Ills, The constant Pair have met, have even reach'd Each others Arms, and then some angry God Has sever'd 'em for ever! say, my Child, When thou hast heard a moving Tale like this, How has thy Heart endur'd it? Hesione. Oh, my Father! Whence are these Words? why urge you this to me? —Where is Omphales? SCENE III. Enter Omphales and Ammon, to Zimon, Tryphon, and Hesione. Omphales. See the happy Man! Call'd by that Voice, were I an Age intomb'd, Methinks, I e'en might force the Grave itself, And struggle thro' the Arms of Death to meet thee! [Embracing her. Here every Fear is lost! this is the Hour The Hour of Joy, and Heaven crowns our Wishes! Thus let this happy Day begin with Blessings. [Kneeling with Hesione, to Zimon, who turns from'em. Hah! why this Silence, and these signs of Mourning? Are these our Nuptials?—Oh, Hesione! [Rising. E'en on this Day shall we converse in Sighs, The sad Intelligence of hopeless Lovers?— Oh, answer me! nor turn thy Face in Sorrow Hesione. Learn there the Cause! a Tale too sad, I fear, He labours to unsold. [Pointing to Zimon. Zimon. Fain wou'd I speak Of Joy, and Comfort to your troubled Souls! Omphales. Whate'er your heavy Story is, at once Declare it: For my Soul had rather prove One certain Evil, than imagine all. Zimon. Imagine what you least cou'd wish to hear. Omphales. Ha! how is this!—By Heav'ns it must be so! It strikes at us, Hesione!—O, arm, Arm thee with Patience, my prophetic Soul! A third Delay!—how long must I endure?— Thou honour'd Parent of Hesione! I see thy gen'rous Breast is troubled for me, Doubt not my Patience: I'm enur'd to suffer! [Pointing to Hesione. If yet the Gods wou'd prove my Constancy, If it concerns thy Peace, that we again Defer our promis'd Bliss, proclaim it now! Name but the certain Time, th' appointed Day When we shall meet in Joy, and tho' till then Each Hour is loaded with an Age's Care; Tho' no pale, lonely Ghost, deny'd its Rest, Shall wish to wander out its Term so fast. Yet point me out that Day! and mark how well I've learnt to suffer for Hesione! Zimon. Oh, Nature!—oh, ye Gods!—how am I torn? Tryphon, declare the Will of Heav'n, while I Withdraw, and mourn their hapless Destiny. [Going off. Omphales. Now, by the Gods, if 'tis of so much Weight, I'll learn it from no Tongue but thine! Zimon. Know then— (But arm your Hearts; for you have much t'endure) Know you can never meet in nuptial Joy! Omphales. Never! Hesione. Avert it Heav'n! Omphales. By all our Sufferance, They are unequal Gods that tell thee this! Zimon. Rash Youth, beware! let me not hear the Pow'rs Revil'd in thy fantastic Passions! By their blest Mansions! by their awful Thunder! If in the face of Heav'n thou fling'st thy Slanders, Wert thou the dearest Issue of these Loins, I wou'd be first to practise Vengeance on thee! —Unequal Gods! Ammon. Heavens! that these shou'd part! This wou'd not be believ'd in Athens. Tryphon. Learn t'endure!— [To Omphales: who is fix'd in Astonishment, and in an Agony of Passion. Nor urge his Wrath!—wast thou not in the Field, When at the Army's Head, an impious Foe Traduc'd the Gods of Greece, while he inrag'd, Rush'd forth, and pierc'd the proud Blasphemer's Heart? Omphales. Never! oh, never! not a distant Hope To rest my Sorrows on! to turn away Despair, and Frenzy, from my tortur'd Soul! Hesione. O think, my Father, think 'twas you who first, Approving blew the kindling Flame of Love! Early you taught me to receive his Vows, And form'd my tender Heart for him alone. Why did you paint him Noble, Gen'rous, Brave, Perfection all, as you wou'd have describ'd Some Offspring of the Gods? why all this Care To train me up to Sorrow? rather why Distant as Pole from Pole were we not plac'd; Or told 'twas Death to gaze? O, yet recall, Recall thy Words, and save us from Despair! Zimon. Daughter, trust Heaven with your Happiness! You'll find the Gods are just. Omphales. Wou'd Man was so! [Recovering from his Astonishment. Now, by our glorious House! by the great Names, And happy Souls of my brave Ancestors, This matter wears a Face of Treachery! 'Tis all Deceit! an impious Artifice! A studied Plot! a poor Conspiracy T'illude my Hopes, evade the promis'd Rites, And cheat me of my Love! by Heav'ns no more! Zimon. Know, when thou wou'dst be busy with my Honour, Thou aim'st at what e'en Envy cannot reach! Omphales. Say, hast thou found a Youth who loves her more? If so best prove him, and it shall be found, Who dares deserve her most! or haply Avarice, The Curse, and cold Disease of Age has seiz'd thee, And it repents thee of the proffer'd Dow'r: Take then thy Off'rings back, and with them all E'er Fortune gave me—Oh, Hesione! We cannot pay too dear for one another! Banish me to some desert Isle remote, Where Int'rest, or Ambition never led Inquiring Man, where yet no Path is worn; But all things rude as at the Birth of Nature: Contented there with her cou'd I sit down, There build the Nuptial Bed, wear out Life's Date, And in those Arms forget there is a World! Hesione. But, oh, to live divided! Omphales. 'Tis a Thought My Nature starts at, and my Mind rejects, As something Monstrous, and Impossible! Ammon. Compose thy Sorrows: Yet she shall be thine. [Apart to Omphales. Omphales. O, Ammon, Ammon, I grow wild with Thought! As soon thou may'st reclaim the angry North, When in his Rage he bows the stubborn Forest. She's mine! She's justly mine! My lawful Claim! By Love, by Suff'rance and by Contract mine! And now to give her up! tamely to part! Let me be branded with a baser Name Than Calumny has found, when that can happen! Whatever desp'rate Man wou'd tear her from me, Shall win her thus!— [Here attempting to draw, Hes. obstructs his Hand. Hesione. Hah! whither art thou hurry'd? Forbear this Violence! raise not thy Arm Against that sacred Head!— Omphales. 'Twas impious!— But thou hast chasten'd me—behold me now Calm, and Repentance all!—O, thou hast Pow'r, E'en with a Look to charm the wildest Frenzy! There dwells a wond'rous Magic in those Beauties, Which, even as the Voice of Harmony, Comes o'er the Soul, and all is strait compos'd! Thus lowly let us bend, and to his Heart Send forth the moving Pray'r of Misery. [Kneeling with Hesione. Zimon. No more! I must not, dare not hear you more! Tryphon instruct the Priests, that they prepare A Sacrifice. I'll to the Altar strait, And thank the Pow'rs, who deign to guide our Actions. SCENE IV. Manent Zimon, Hesione, Omphales, and Ammon. Hesione. Yet think, my Father, think how much I owe That wondrous Youth! Zimon. Arise, Hesione! Thou know'st me tender as thy Soul shou'd wish: Thou know'st me too, when Heav'n, and Duty call, Rigid as Death!—Thy Mother was a Spartan, And wou'd have dy'd, e'er she had own'd this Softness, No more of it, if thou woud'st hold my Love! [They rise. 'Tis thro' the best Compassion of my Soul, That I refuse to grant, what Heav'n forbids. Omphales. O barbarous Mercy of mistaken Zeal! How dreadful are those blind Enthusiasts, Who wound in Mercy, and torment, to save? I'm lost for ever! Famine, Exile, Chains Have none so deeply wretched! Zimon. Let us hence! [To Hesione. I can allow no farther Conference. Hesione. Hear me, Omphales, hear me, e'er we part! (Haply no more my Voice may reach your Ears) When we are banish'd far from one another, And thy poor Heart is breaking with its Sorrows, Call to thy Mind the solemn Vow I made, When, once conversing in the Myrtle Bower, We talk'd of Separation, then in Joy, And sporting as it were, with Misery. Be that thy Comfort in the Hour of Mourning! Omphales. When'er 'tis said, Omphales loves thee less; Mourns not thy Absence like a faithful Wretch; Gives respite to Affliction; or receives Comfort from ought but thee: when this thou'rt told, Conclude Distraction has been busy here, And I'm no more Omphales! Hesione. Thou art true! Omphales. We both are true! Hesione. Omphales will not rest; Nor think of Peace without me!—Oh, farewel! Omphales. Farewel! and with thee all our Happiness; [Exeunt Zimon and Hesione. SCENE V. Manent Omphales, and Ammon. She's gone! And never to return to me! Hide thee, Omphales, hide thee from thy self, Nor dare inquire how wretched thou art grown! Ammon. I've found a Stratagem shall make her thine, Yet thou shalt hope! Thy Ammon bids thee Hope, Omphales. Oh, Ammon, I am curs'd beyond all Hope! Lead me to some yet unfrequented Shade, Which Nature in Despight of Joy has made; The melancholy Mansion of Despair, Gloomy, and horrid as the Fate I bear; Where hollow Winds, where Springs invite to mourn, And Echoes sadly every Sigh return: There I'll grow wild thro' the Excess of Grief, And in Distraction only find Relief! [Exeunt. The End of the Second ACT. ACT. III. SCENE I. Enter Ammon. Omphales! hovering still about this Place, [Discovering his Approach. And ling'ring in his Task!—'tis not so well, I thought e'er this he had reach'd the Gates of Athens. SCENE II. Enter Omphales to Ammon. Omphales. Am I on Earth? Or have the Gods receiv'd me? A Summons, Ammon, welcome as the Voice Which whispers Liberty to Dungeon Slaves; Pleasing as Dreams of Health to the Diseas'd; Or Hope to the despairing Penitent. Th' indulgent Maid hastes to the conscious Bow'r, The former Scene of more successful Love; Thither invites me to a last Farewel! But when again I find her downy Bosom, Shall I forgo the happy, lov'd Retreat? Return content that we have mourn'd our Fate?— No!—'tis resolv'd!— Ammon. All's ruin'd if they meet! [Aside. Omphales. Exile with her, or for her Death is pleasing! [Going off. Ammon. No! You depart not thus! [Detaining him. Omphales. Delay me not! Ammon. A Moment! Omphales. Moments are too precious now!— This is too much!— Ammon. By the dear Name of Friend! Omphales. My Friend! and hold me from Hesione! Away!—By Heav'ns, I can endure no more! Ammon. By Heav'ns, I must detain thee! hear me speak! You cannot meet! Omphales. Hah!—cannot:—by the Gods! If any Tongue but thine had spoke these Words, I wou'd have call'd it false! Ammon. Thou art too warm! What I relate, I tell thee from her Mouth, And learnt e'en now to save thee! Is it thus Omphales pays my Care? Am I thrown off, Spurn'd with Contempt, cast, like a fawning Slave, From him, whose Wrongs I've labour'd to redress? Whose Sorrows are my own?—Why then no more: But hasten to Destruction! Omphales. Oh my Friend! Forgive me! I'm become a froward Wretch! Wearied beyond the Pow'r of Patience!— Say, whence this sudden Change? Ammon. Her jealous Father Has torn the Secret of your Meeting from her: And since, before the Altar he has sworn, If e'er again you're found within these Walls, To treat you as a common Enemy! A Robber; or a Persian! Omphales. Mistaken Man! Oh, how unequal is the State of Lovers? A Moment's Hope elates us to the Clouds; And in a Moment more some sudden Fear, Some Disappointment pulls us down again Lower than Envy's self cou'd wish to place us! —But tell me, Ammon, tell me from thy Soul, How does she bear our Separation? Ammon. You cannot doubt her? Omphales. That were impious! Ammon. Nor shall you fear th' Extremity of Grief: Yet justly she bemoans her absent Mate. Remote she sat; her Words were few and forc'd; Her Eyes still fix'd; her Posture still the same: Down either Cheek a Tear had made its Way, Two more stood ripe, and ready to pursue 'em; And had not Sighs inform'd me she cou'd breathe, She'ad seem'd the Image of despairing Beauty. Not Venus look'd more lovely in her Sorrow, When she beheld the Youth Adonis slain! Yet she might raise her Head to speak of you! Omphales. By Heav'ns, I see her!—Oh, my tortur'd Soul!— So truly do I love her Happiness, I almost wish she might forget me now! Yet all my Comfort is—that cannot be! Oh, Ammon, if thy breast hath ever heav'd For Sorrows not thy own; if yet thy Heart Hath prov'd the anxious Pain of hopeless Love, Thou now must feel for an unhappy Friend! Ammon. I'm not to learn Love's Pangs—there was a Time! Omphales. And coud'st thou truly love? and dost thou live To tell it, as an idle Dream that's past? Ammon. Thou art, indeed, a Lover! Omphales. I am true: Nor blush to own it—Oh, Hesione! The Pain I feel, instructs me what you suffer! I fear! I fear! for you are all compos'd Of Tenderness!—O Ammon, tell me all! Deceive me not! Speak all her Sorrow out! The worst unfold! Her very Words impart! Hide her not from me! Ammon. O, she utter'd all That Love in Pain, and Absence might conceive: Oft o'er, and o'er again she told her Passion; For Love, tho' in a thousand Modes it speaks, Says but one thing: the varied Eloquence Of Lovers means no more, than that they Love. 'Midst other Things, she joy'd, you had receiv'd What I propos'd; for I had told her all. Omphales. And she approv'd it? Ammon. Wish'd it were begun! Urg'd its Performance! and my Fancy errs, Or she preferr'd it in her parting Words To thee! even here!—“Omphales will not rest, “Nor think of Peace without me! Omphales. Now, by Heav'ns Such were her Words! Ammon. And in the instant chang'd Her Sorrow into Frowns, as she had meant— There's need of Violence!—mark'd you not that? Omphales. Ammon, as there are Gods in yon bright Heav'n! I will not rest! I will not think of Peace, 'Till I accomplish all! I've linger'd here too long. Farewel! be ready to perform thy Charge. The beauteous Prize already chides my Sloth, Stands at the Goal, and beckons me away. [Exit Omphales. Ammon. Farewel, my Friend! if e'er we meet again, And meet as Foes, I meet but with a Man. SCENE III. Enter Tryphon to Ammon. Tryphon!—let me embrace thee! thou'rt, indeed, A Match for this good Age! I read Success, And Triumph in thy Face—what woud'st thou say? Hast thou propos'd it? will he call me Son? Tell me, my Oracle! for on thy Words My Destiny depends. Tryphon. Hope, Ammon, hope! All shall be well! Ammon. He has consented then? Tryphon. Not absolutely given his Consent; Nor have I grossly put him to the Test; But only by Insinuations Have yet obliquely touch'd upon the Subject; Observing how he might be wrought upon; How far we might proceed with Confidence. As thus;—supposing you had lov'd his Daughter! That Providence had thrown you in her Way! —I gag'd him so—He answers in a Sigh, And wish'd some Pow'r might guide him to her Good. Ammon. Excellent Tryphon!—we must lose no Time: While warm, he'll best be form'd to our Intent. Tryphon. Fear not! I left him at the Sacrifice: Soon as 'tis ended, he appointed me To meet him here; then will I press it home, And in such Terms as shall not fail to move. Ammon. A Doubt yet haunts my Mind—Hesione, She bears her Disappointment heavily, And may be violent. Tryphon. Her Father's Will Is sacred to her, as the Law of Heaven! How is she fam'd for her Obedience? I look not on her, as on one consenting: But, trust me, Ammon, many a stubborn Maid Softens like Wax in the Embracer's Hold, And yields to strange Impressions in his Arms. Ammon. O, let me feel the mourning Beauty there! I'll kiss away her Tears, suppress her Sighs, Warm her, and find the Passage to her Heart; While, like a Flow'r reviving in the Sun, She shall look up, and bless her Comforter! Joy, like the Light, shall break thro' all her Sorrow, Chear her sad Heart, and drive Omphales thence! Tryphon. First he must hence! 'tis he whom we shou'd fear, 'Tis him we shou'd suspect of Violence! Secure him instantly!—I've had a Thought— Suppose him Dead! it shall be after told, And with a shew of Reason, that Despair Drew his own Sword against him. Ammon. 'Tis too late: My Care already has diverted him. I took him in the height of Disappointment; Acted the Friend; discours'd his Injuries o'er, Told him I felt 'em all, and thus advis'd him. Get thee to Athens; to the noble Youth, Thy Friends, and Partners of the sacred Band, The Band, which by a solemn League are bound, To succour, and redress each other's Wrongs. Tell 'em, how Zimon has dishonour'd thee; Conjure 'em, to assist thee in thy Right; Select a resolute, and a faithful Few; Secure 'em in the Covert of yon Grove, 'Till, at my promis'd Signal, they rush in Impetuous, and bear away the Maid. Blinded with Love, he embrac'd the Enterprize, And, to confirm his Resolution, I told him, that Hesione approv'd it. Tryphon. But how hast thou secur'd him from Success? Ammon. Know, it is thus contriv'd! this very Hour A Paper will be found before the Senate, Declaring the whole Purpose of Omphales; Their very Place of Consultation. Imagine the Result of this Attempt! Can such a Violence against this House Be known, and prosper? at a Juncture too When Athens must implore her Gen'ral's Aid? Tryphon. True! Valour's ever courted in Distress. Ammon. Nay, more! our Law makes instant Banishment The Meed of such Offenders. Tryphon. Yet whene'er again Thy Friend grows dang'rous, see him in his Tomb! So is he well secur'd! the Maxim's good: A sanguine Politician taught it me. It might have sav'd thee too from Calumny. How will the rigid Votaries of Justice Exclaim against thee, shou'd it e'er be known, How you've deceiv'd this Friend? this Intimate? Ammon. Out on the subtle Herd! let me succeed, And thou shalt find 'em loudest in my Praise: The Fortunate were never in the Wrong. Invest me once in Zimon's large Possessions, My Faults shall die, and Flatt'ry will not fail To picture Virtues for me. Tryphon. Let, at lest, The Name of Friend be lost! contrive some Slight Of which thou may'st accuse him. Ammon. Be it so! Tryphon. 'Twill set some Gloss upon this Action. —Tho' if I fail not in my Stratagem, Zimon shall even court thee to thy Wish. Ammon. Succeed what will succeed!—I'm well resolv'd! Tho' poor, I'm proud; and cannot suffer Scorn; Have Appetites, and want the Means to feed 'em. Courage, Extravagance, and Luxury Was all th' Inheritance my Father left me. My Pride is my fond Mother's Legacy: My young Hippolitus! she oft wou'd cry, My little Theseus! thou art nobly born! Sprung from a Race of Heroes, and of Gods! —Then in the Streets of Athens thus they have it— Behold the Orphan! Zimon's Pensioner!— How is that House decay'd!—By Heav'ns a Dog Wou'd blush, and turn to be so pointed at! Tryphon. No more of this! the happy Change is near! Learn to forget thy self, and thy old Friends. Henceforth thou shalt be reckon'd with the First; At Feasts, and Games be plac'd next Zimon's self; Shine in the Tyrian Dye; be gaz'd upon; Envy'd by many, yet caress'd by all. The Time draws on—thou hast a Part to act In my Design, which now thou art to learn. Ammon. But see! the Object of my Wish appears! And, like Aurora wrapt in sullen Clouds, Advances mourning. Yet so ripe she seems! Her Charms so ready! so compos'd for Love! Tryphon. Let us not now be found in Conference! I wou'd retire. Ammon. To yonder Portico— I will but gaze awhile, and follow thee. [Exit Tryphon. SCENE IV. Enter Hesione to Ammon. Hesione. It must be so! the Message which I sent Has either misinform'd him of the Place; Or thro' some Treach'ry never reach'd his Ears. Hah! Ammon here!—he haply may inform me. Ammon. If 'tis the lost Omphales whom you seek, The Man whose Fate I once sincerely mourn'd, In vain you ask him of his old Companion: Inrag'd, impatient he departed hence, Loud against me, 'gainst Heaven, and his Fate; And, when I would have been a Comfort to him, He spurn'd me off; and bid me fawn no more! Hesione. Forget it, Ammon; much he has endur'd, And, like a wayward Infant, shou'd be sooth'd, And soften'd into Temper. Thou'rt sincere, And earnest, and too apt to think thou'rt wrong'd. Ammon. Thou art sincere, and earnest, and too apt To think thou'rt— Hesione. What? Ammon. Belov'd! Hesione. I take thee not. Ammon. He swore that you, and all your Sex were false; That he had been at some appointed Place— I know not where—but that you had contriv'd T' abuse his Patience, and insult his Love. Hesione. Unhappy Youth! his Troubles are too great, And Reason fails beneath the Weight of Sorrow: For he himself cou'd never call me False, Ne'er doubt my Truth! his is a generous Soul, Noble, and glorious as the Form he wears! Love, and Suspicion dwell not there together. You too forgive him, Ammon; 'tis too much In one sad Day to lose his Friend, and me: Nor wonder, you was treated with Disdain, When I might not be spar'd. Ammon. This his Return Of Friendship?—thus I blow such Friends away! Hesione. Thou'rt lost with Ease. Ammon. I am not won so soon!— My Soul abhors the least Ingratitude! [Exit Ammon. SCENE V. Hesione sola. Omphales Breast is Stranger to such Baseness! When Nature form'd him, she forgot 'twas Man, And made him up of Virtues!—this his Friend? The boasted, happy Sharer of his Heart? My Mind informs me wrong, or he's deceiv'd. This looks like Treach'ry—something I cou'd dread! But what, alas! have Wretches left to fear— Yes! to another's Arms I may be forc'd: But then I know my Vow, and will prepare. Oh my Omphales! whither art thou fled From the lov'd Haven where thy Soul might rest! Like some poor Turtle widow'd of her Love, Anxious, I sought thee long thro' ev'ry Grove: But oh! the restless, fond Pursuit is vain; Pensive, I find my sad Retreat again, Brood o'er my Care, and murmur out my Pain. [Exit. The End of the Third ACT. ACT IV. SCENE I. Ammon, and Tryphon. Ammon. Nor yet the Rites of Sacrifice are past. I scent the Fat of Oxen from the Altar, And snuff the Censer's fragrant Offering. Tryphon. At length it ends. Behold the sinking Flame: Zimon advances, and the busy Priests Croud to divide their savoury Perquisites. He comes in haste to meet me: now's our time: Retire, and wait the Opportunity. Ammon. Now Mercury inspire thee! [Ammon absconds. Tryphon. Peace! he's here. SCENE II. Enter Zimon to Tryphon. Zimon. How am I blest, to have been born in Greece, Where every Pow'r is found with Sacrifice, And every Action guided from above? And now my Gratitude is paid to Heav'n, To thee, the Instrument thro' whom the Gods Convey their Wills, thou second Cause of Good, Tryphon, to thee I bow, and thus I thank thee— Embracing him. Nor, trust me, sacred Prophet, shou'd I blush E'en in our Forum, in the Face of Athens To bend more lowly to those reverend Seers, The Gods distinguish thus— [Offering to kneel to him Tryphon. Alas my Lord! [Obstructing him. The best of us are Men, and frail ones too! Zimon. How shall I pay thy Care? Tryphon. If other End, Beside the secret Joy of doing Good, Its Authors have propos'd; I'm Stranger to it. Wou'dst thou o'erpay what I've already done?— Let me do more!—I speak in a just Cause, And will be bold! my Duty makes me bold! Know, all is yet not right within thy Walls! This House is threaten'd with impending Dangers! The Wound is covered o'er; but yet not cur'd! —Be strictly on thy Guard! Zimon. Explain thy self! Tryphon. Look to thy Daughter! Zimon. Hah! Tryphon. Observe her well! Is she obedient in this time of Tryal? Does Zimon, or Omphales rule the Maid? If I presage aright, some Violence Against the Will of Heav'n is now conspir'd. Zimon. What's to be done? Tryphon. Best marry her. Zimon. To whom? Tryphon. 'Twere Mercy, tho' a shackled Slave possess'd her, To save her from Omphales! marry her! Secure her from her self, and suddenly! 'Twill ease thy loaded Heart of every Care, And so thou shalt sit down again in Peace, And thank the Gods, thou'st done a Parent's Duty. Zimon. Some Pow'r direct me! Tryphon. Fix thy Choice on one Whom Heav'n shall seem to point at, tho' he's found As poor as Merit, and as much forsaken. Be Heaven still the Guide of all thy Actions, The fix'd, and certain Star, by whose sure Light Thou safely may'st direct thy doubtful Course. —Say, hast thou treasur'd in thy Memory What was reveal'd last Night?—observe it well! And so thou can'st not err. Zimon. Heav'n best can tell, I wou'd not err!—renew it to my Mind. Tryphon. Hear, and attend! thus spoke th' immortal Voice! The longing Youth, and sighing Maid For whom these sacred Rites are paid, The Storms of adverse Fate shall prove Whene'er they meet in Nuptial Love. Seek, near the Maid, a Noble Youth, In Treasure less; but more in Truth; Who loves; yet wou'd conceal his Pain: The Gods for him the Maid ordain! Zimon. Seek near the Maid!—near her—haply in Blood! Let me reflect!—amongst our great Allies Think'st thou Lysander worthy of her Love? Or rather Mentheus?— Tryphon. Guard her from his Arms! An Unbeliever! nurs'd in the loose Sehools Of Epicurus!—thou may'st recollect, Before the Sacrifice I gave some Hints Towards one I thought intended for thy Choice. Zimon. I think thou did'st; and thou did'st speak of Ammon? Tryphon. Ammon it was—and might I judge in this, Ammon shou'd call thee Father—'tis a Thought Has often forc'd it self upon my Mind, Intruding on my Meditations, And, when I most have strove to bury it, It still wou'd rise, and haunt my Memory: And most of late. I am not credulous; Nor yet esteem it lawful, to resist The Hints of Heav'n, howe'er obscure at first And faint in their Beginning; so resolv'd To give it to Reflection, as I sat Retir'd, and musing in my hallow'd Seat, The sacred Place for Divination chose, Where oft the wond'rous, and resistless Pow'r Revisits, and informs my labouring Breast. There, while I thought, thus it occur'd to me! 'Midst all the Blessings Heaven has granted Zimon, A Son has been deny'd his fervent Prayr's, A Son, to follow in his track of Glory; To pay just Honours to his sacred Tomb; And, by a noble, and illustrious Race, Transmit his Name e'en to the last of Time: But when he's summon'd hence, a Female Hand Must glad some Stranger's House with his Possessions. Zimon. Nor have I murmur'd yet! Tryphon. Thus thought I, pensive. When lo! a secret Impulse from within Made silent Answer—then have Zimon's Prayers, His Gists, his Off'rings no regard in Heaven? Or sees he not the Son the Gods provide? E'en him he feeds? the Son who wants a Sire? The Son whose Father Zimon wants? Zimon. My Friend! The faithful Cleon! Tryphon. E'en that very Friend! The same who in the moment of thy Danger, Advanc'd 'twixt thee, and Death, and in his Heart (His honest Heart) receiv'd the fatal Weapon. Zimon. While there is Warmth, and feeling in this Breast. That Action claims the noblest of its Sorrows! Tryphon. I've heard too, that, expiring in your Arms, His Son he recommended to your Care, And in these Words breath'd out his gen'rous Spirit. “As thou art more, or less a Father to him, “So lives the Name, and Honour of thy House! Construe it thus—his Name shall be forgot; But thine shall live, and be maintain'd in him. There's more than Sound! a Meaning in his Words! Prophetic Strength!—the Souls of dying Men, Breaking from Nature, feel Perfection near, And, as Immortals, can look into Fate. Let us not slight these Hints! thou wou'dst not err! Zimon. Whene'er I do, my Heart intends it not! Tryphon. Add then to these what Heav'n has now reveal'd! Methinks, the Words direct us to the Man. Seek near the Maid [observe] a noble Youth, In Treasure less—[Mark that]—but more in Truth; Who loves, yet wou'd conceal his Pain! Zimon. Who Loves!— Tryphon. I have observ'd his Looks of late, Watch'd every motion of his Eyes, which still I've found attracted to the lovely Maid. Zimon. The Eyes are faithful Ministers in Love, And ill disguise the Purpose of the Soul. If thou might'st prove him ta'en in Beauty's Toyls— Tryphon. Lo, where he comes! with weight upon his Brow. Zimon. And seems to hold a Conference with himself. Tryphon. Haply his Words may lead us to the Truth: 'Tis the Delight of Lovers to retire, And tell their darling Sorrow to the Winds, Here let us stand, and listen to his Talk. [They abscond. SCENE III. Enter Ammon. O, for a Heart of true Camelion Temper, To change, and turn, and shift to all Complexions! Then might Omphales hence! then might I tell What labours here, and beats for Utterance! —Yet shall I hide from Zimon aught? from him Thro' whom I breathe? ought of this Nature too? —Yet sure 'tis vain! a Child of busy Fancy! Or some delusive Dæmon haunts my Slumbers! —But then again 'tis pow'rful in my Soul, And something like a Duty bids me on. Oh, I'm all War within!—some Pow'r direct me!— [Seems going off. SCENE IV. Enter Zimon, and Tryphon again to Ammon. Zimon. Ammon? Ammon. My Patron! Zimon. I conjure thee, stay— If yet thou hold'st thy Father's Memory dear; If Zimon merits ought of Friendship from thee, Unfold thy self?—what hast thou seen, or heard To shake thee thus? whence is it, I demand, Thou'rt haunted by thy self? I charge thee, speak! Tell this strange Secret, which so fears the Air, Yet struggles to be known! Ammon. What means my Patron? Zimon. No more Evasions, Ammon! 'tis too late: I overhear'd thee—dost thou fear to trust me? Now by the sacred Guardians of my House! By my good Sword, and Fame, I'll do it right! Whate'er it be, it meets with Justice here! Ammon. 'Twas but a Dream! Tryphon. Remember, Ammon, Dreams Are sacred Things; for Dreams descend from fove. Ammon. Forbid it, Heav'n, I shou'd resist thy Will! Zimon. And thou conceal'st it yet. Ammon. Why then, my Lord, I will be bold, and open all my Soul; —But first resolve me this! thus on my Knees I beg, thou wilt resolve me from thy Heart; For it concerns my Peace—hast thou decreed Art thou irrevocably fix'd to hold Thy Daughter from my Friend? Tryphon. Observe you that? [Apart to Zimon. Zimon. Art thou to learn me yet? when am I found Irresolute, and wav'ring in my Duty? Tho' to these Eyes she's dearer than the Light, Whene'er he meets her in the nuptial Bed, May Nature err! and Monsters be their Offspring. Ammon. It is enough! and witness now ye Pow'rs, [Rises. By whose dread Names Omphales seal'd our Friendship! Witness! I've now been faithful to the Man Who scorns his sacred Vow!—no more! I'm free! And thus with Honour may unfold my self. —Know then, my Patron, even at that Time When first your Daughter's Nuptials were deferr'd, In the last Hour of Night, when all was hush'd, And Sleep had shed its kindly Influence on me, Hesione appears to grace my Slumbers. Not as she's wont by Day: but unattir'd, Unbound, and wild her Hair, her Garments flowing, And loosen'd all as for the Nuptial Bed. A while she gaz'd upon me, and in Smiles, Such as assenting Deities bestow, Seem'd to persuade me, that her Heart was mine. Ambitious Dream! but mark the heavy Change! For from that Time, e'en from that very Hour, Forgive me, if I say, I lov'd her more Than Health, or Life, or all that Heav'n can give! Tryphon. Have I presag'd aright? Zimon. O, thou unerring Seer! Ammon. Yet less than Honour! for I told my Heart She was my Friend's, and strove to humble it. This past, and Day by Day I grew in Fondness! At length the second, solemn Tryal came; Heav'n still averse! the Rites again deferr'd! This, I confess, alarm'd me! now the Pow'rs, And Precedents of Visions I besought With due Libations, Pray'r, and Sacrifice, That, if not false, my Dream might be renew'd With clearer Evidence: when, lo! again I met her in my Slumbers; met him too Whom I wou'd call my Friend, the lost Omphales. In vain, methought, he strove to hold the Maid, While like some Nymph of Dian's nimble Train, Thro' fancy'd Ways, o'er Hills, and flow'ry Plains Swiftly she fled from his desiring Arms; And with a gentle Wafture of her Hand Bid me pursue—and then last Night again— But thou art sick already of my Tale! Zimon. If thou in ought regard'st or Heav'n, or me, I charge thee, on! Ammon. Then thus in brief!—last Night Deck'd in her Marriage Garment she appear'd. The Hymeneal Pomp; the nuptial Brands, Attending Virgins, and rejoicing Friends Were all around: and, strange! I there beheld, (As Death's cold Hand had ne'er obstructed her) Her Mother!—who in Smiles— Zimon. Be brief in that! Ammon. Why then no more than this! to Ammon's Arms You gave Hesione, and we were happy. Zimon. Then happy may'st thou be! Tryphon. Art thou convinc'd? Zimon. O, ye immortal Pow'rs! Tryphon. What Proofs are here? O Zimon, thou art favour'd of the Gods! Ammon. Surely again I dream! and this is yet Another pleasing Vision! Zimon. No, thou wak'st To Joy, to Hymen! to Hesione! Ammon. Shall the poor Orphan Ammon be so rais'd? Zimon. Think in whose Cause thou did'st become an Orphan! For me thou lost a Father, and in me Most right it is, that thou shou'dst find a Father. And thus, ye Pow'rs, ye manifest your Justice! Tryphon. Thy Piety is register'd above! Zimon. O Tryphon, I have been an Age in Debt! I blush, with shame I blush, when I reflect How poor in Gratitude, how slow I've been In my Returns of Love to Cleon's Offspring! Ammon. My Father's Action was its own Reward: For well he knew, when he preserv'd thy Life, In thee he sav'd our State, and dy'd for Athens. Zimon. Oh, Athens felt his Fall!—he was a Man!— —Tryphon, betake thee to the holy Place! There let the Priests adorn a sacred Altar; With Garlands see it dress'd of genial Flow'rs; Spread on it all the Fragrance of the East, Each costly Spice, each Gum Arabia yields, That on th' aspiring Sweets their Nuptial Vows May mount aloft, and be receiv'd in Heav'n! [Exit Tryphon. SCENE V. Manent Zimon, and Ammon. Ammon. O, may I live but to deserve this Blessing! Zimon. We'll to Hesione; and she shall learn What I've resolv'd, and listen to thy Vows. —I might be tedious in my Daughter's Praise; But thou hast known her long: when I give her, I give thee all the Virtues of her Sex! In Errors lost unguided Mortals stray; But here the Gods direct us in our Way! [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth ACT. ACT. V. SCENE I. Hesione sola. Unfold, O Death, thy hospitable Arms! The wretched Court, the happy fear thy Pow'r: Yet thou art just! for tho' thou steal'st away Our little Joy, thou hast our Sorrow too, And Fear, and Hope are both forgot in thee! Thou'rt cold: but thou art quiet!—Oh! I long For the still Tomb, that I may think no more! —No Dawn of Hope appears! the Danger's near! I'm driven to the Brink, and now must fall! Scarce have I Time to see my Vow perform'd, So fast the gath'ring Tempest gains upon me. SCENE II. Enter Ammon to Hesione, as following her. Ammon. O, fly not thus in Scorn, thou woundrous Maid! O, turn!—O, answer me! Hesione. No more! away! And leave me to my Sorrow! Ammon. No! I'll on! And thou shalt hear me! Now's the time to show Your Piety to Heav'n, and to your Sire; Virtues for which, of all th' Athenian Daughters, Hesione has ever most been fam'd. Hesione. Oh, Ammon, Ammon! thou hast torn asunder The truest Pair that ever met in Love! Ammon. Blame the just Gods! tell the all-equal Pow'rs That they have wrong'd thee! Hesione. Thou'rt the Injurer! There's Treachery! Treachery! 'Tis manifest To all, but him who shou'd discern it most. My Father is abus'd! His gen'rous Breast Glows with a thousand great, and glorious Virtues: Thou know'st it well; for some of them have warm'd thee! Yet, thro' the single Error of his Soul, His only Weakness, thou hast found a way To ruin him and all his Hopes for ever! Ammon. I love him, and he knows it: question him; And he will tell thee, I was won with Art, To accept the Blessing Heav'n, and he design me. Hesione. That he is won by Art is now too plain! Think on Omphales too! thy injur'd Friend! Oh, he wou'd talk of thee, and of thy Truth, Till even I grew Jealous of thy Pow'r, And fear'd thy growing Empire in his Heart! How often have I heard your Vows exchang'd, When thou hast sworn, the Sun it self shou'd fade, And Nature cease, whenever thou wert false?— Cease Nature then! and fade ye conscious Beams! For thou art false! Omphales is betray'd! Ammon. If e'er Omphales wore me at his Heart, My Friendship taught him first to place me there: And, as an instance of uncommon Faith, Know, in my dear Regard to this Omphales, [This no way injur'd; but unhappy Man] I've labour'd long to hide my mighty Love; With Pain conceal'd it: even as a Child, Who fears the chiding of an angry Voice, I've held my Passion in! Hesione. No more of Love! It loses on thy Tongue. Ammon. By Heav'ns, I love! And thou shall prove it! [Offering to embrace her, she rejects him.] Hesione. Hence! Shall I receive A foul, and grisly Satyr to that Heart, Which one, resembling Heav'n, has earn'd with Truth, Unwearied Patience, and an Age of Love? Ammon. O, let me sooth thee to thy Happiness! I wou'd endeavour to deserve thy Smiles. We'll live up to the height of fond Delight: And every Joy that Art, or Nature yields, Shall wait to catch the Moment of our Wishes. Sorrow remote shall stand, and gloomy Care Be known but by its Name. The Persian Queen Far off shall hear thy State, and envy thee. Hesione. Think not to lure me with thy sensual Baits! Tempt base, and abject Minds!—Thou hast affirm'd That thou dost love: What canst thou then for Love? Canst thou endure an Age of fruitless Pain, And yet another, and still greatly Love? Tho' Exile, Want, Oppression stood before thee, Woud'st thou not faint; but still pursue thy Hope? Say, canst thou this for Love? and can'st thou too, When Hope is lost, in th' Hour of black Despair, Give up the World, and for thy Love expire? Ammon. I'm none of Plato's Lovers: but a Man! Who court substantial Joy!—I tell thee, Fair!— Hesione. No more: but leave me: I wou'd be retir'd. Ammon. Behold! thy Father hastes to joyn our Hands. Hesione. I wou'd not meet him thus! It wounds my Heart To vex his gen'rous Nature. I'll withdraw, A Moment only, to compose my Thoughts: Then all resign'd to the dread Will of Fate, He'll find me at the Altar. Ammon. This is kind! You now appear, indeed, like Zimon's Daughter. Exit Hesione. SCENE III. Enter Zimon. to Ammon. Zimon. How stands the Maid? Did she not leave thee now? Ammon. She did; and promises Obedience: She'll meet us in the holy Place. Zimon. 'Tis well!— This Day will be a Day of publick Joy. An Hecatombe must bleed, and Gods and Men Shall banquet in these Walls! I've now dispers'd My several Invitations all around. And, in return for Heav'ns peculiar Grace, This Day I yearly mean to solemnize. Ammon. Thou'rt ever Grateful! Zimon. Ammon, I am Just; And glory that I am! Ammon. And pitying too: For when you broke the Will of Heav'n to her, Preferr'd my Vows, and bid her Heart be mine, How did you struggle to resist her Sorrows? I saw you labour with a Father's Love, While Duty, and Compassion softly strove, And wag'd a tender War within your Breast. Zimon. Yet you observ'd how I inforc'd it too? How resolutely just I was? Ammon. I did. Zimon. There's not a Soul o'er whom my Power extends, Shall dare to spurn at Heaven! Ammon. Yet the Path Which leads to Heaven's Will, is sometimes rough, And difficult to tread. Zimon. 'Tis true, her Task Might in another tire Obedience out; But I have train'd her up to Piety!— O Ammon, slight not a fond Father's Praise! But, trust me, she will answer all thy Hope. Approach her not like one made proud by Power, Demanding Love in Frowns; but gently steal The Maid's Affection: Tenderness, and Smiles May win her to the hardest Parts of Duty. SCENE IV. Enter Tryphon, to Zimon, and Ammon. Tryphon. O Zimon, Zimon! now thou art indeed, The last of wretched Men! Ammon. What's this? Zimon. The Cause? Declare it! I'm prepar'd for all Events! Tryphon Thy Daughter— Zimon, Ammon. Hah! Tryphon. The rash Hesione, As now the Priests prepar'd the holy Place, With an impatient Fury in her Looks Approach'd the Altar, where upon her Knees Thrice she invok'd Omphales, and the Gods; Then drinking deep of that most deadly Bane Against whose Force no Antidote prevails, Ye Pow'rs, she cry'd, behold my Vow discharg'd! Zimon. Forbid it, Heav'n! Tryphon. She raves, now calls on Death! Now on Omphales! Ammon. Then no Life for me! My Hopes are lost! Zimon. Oh, impious Violence! Ammon. I promis'd this good Sword to ease my Heart When'er I knew Despair! I've breath'd thus long But in the Expectation of to-day. Let Cowards live in Pain! I'm not so brave! Zimon. E'en in Contempt of Heaven's Clemency To cast her Being off! Ammon. Nay, think not Heav'n— Tryphon. Where tends thy Rage? [Apart to Ammon. Ammon. Away! thou canst no more! Tryphon. Hear me! This Disappointment hurts thy Brain! Zimon. Where have I err'd, that Heaven in its Wrath Shou'd cast this Weight upon my weary Age? Ammon. Live? to become the Figure of Decay? [Breaking from Tryphon. To stalk, like a repining, meagre Ghost, About th' Athenian Streets? Feeding the Pride, And Insolence of Fortune's pamper'd Fools? Rather Obscurity, and endless Sleep! A Sleep which Fate's severest Storms defyes! Against whose pow'rful Charm the thousand Tongues Of Scorn, Reproach, and Envy hiss in vain! Zimon. Nor let me murmur yet! The Gods far off Beheld this Storm, and suffer'd it to fall! Tryphon. Is this the Resolution of a Man? [Apart to Ammon. Insects, the Creatures of a Summer's Heat, Who live but in the Bounty of the Sun, And in the Season of Inclemency, Seek Death in Holes, make such an End as this! Ammon. I'll treat thee as a sordid Instrument, Made for some base Design, which, being us'd, With Loathing, and Contempt is cast away. Zimon. Yet 'tis a Parent's Duty to receive Her last, sad Words, and close her Eyes in Death! [Going off, is detain'd by Ammon. Ammon. Patron! I owe thee for some Favours past— Beware of this thy evil Counsellor! Woud'st thou believe, that hoary, reverend Man, Who smiles like Innocence, and talks of Heav'n, Thy Action's Guide, the Partner of thy Heart Has wrong'd thee? been the Author of these Ills? Suffer'd a Bribe? and trifled with the Gods, To rob thee of thy Daughter, and thy Fortunes? In Combination too with that same Orphan Whom thou hast cherish'd from his Infancy? I say, woud'st thou believe it? Zimon. Hah!—believe it! Tryphon. Madness! the Rage of disappointed Love! Ammon. Credit a Man, devoted to Despair! A Man, who builds not on to Morrow's Hopes! But hates the Light, and longs to be no more! Zimon. Tryphon, if it be sound thou hast practis'd on me! If of their Hopes thou hast wrong'd this faithful Pair! 'Twere better—nay, by Heav'ns thou shalt be prov'd! [Threatning him. If thou return'st, like Gold from out the Fire, Purg'd and refin'd, and brighten'd from the Tryal I meet thee thus! and take thee to my Heart— [Embracing him. This, if thou'rt Faithful found: if otherwise, No Torture can be equal to thy Crime!— I've heard, indeed, that Artifice, and Fraud Have lurk'd beneath the Vail of Sanctity! Tryphon. In Hope of Mercy I confess it all! [Kneeling. Zimon. Mercy!—Ye Gods! if in such Shapes as these, So near your sacred Altars we're betray'd, Where is't that Man is safe? Ammon. In Death alone! Zimon. Within! Secure him strait! [Enter Attendants who seize Tryphon and carry him off. SCENE V. Manent Zimon, and Ammon. Ammon. Come, joyn with me, To curse Mankind, and leave the savage Race! A poor Man lives not here without Contempt! They stare upon the Monster! point him out! And hunt him, like Infection, from the Herd! Their very Mercy tastes of Cruelty! In Pride they grant, and spurn the humble Wretch Who feeds upon their Bounty! Zimon. Thankless Man! [A Trumpet What may this mean?—a Herald from the State. Ammon. Then, lo! I prophesy!—prepare for War! Arm for the Persian!—after Ammon's Death Tell it with wonder, that a Prophet once Spoke Truth in Greece! SCENE VI. Enter a Herald, to Zimon, and Ammon. Zimon. Hail, sacred Messenger! What from the Senate? can I serve the State? I've liv'd for Greece, and now for Greece wou'd dye! Be brief with me! Herald. Let mighty Zimon know, Athens once more invites him to the Field. The Persians have forgot thy Victories, And rise again, to fall before thy Sword. This will inform you— [Delivering a Paper. Ammon. Now, ye equal Powers! Pour down your Vengeance on th' Athenian Pride! May Persian Rage devour their guilty Land, And kill the Name of Athens! Herald. Athens greets thee— [Proceeding with Zimon The Senators of Athens are thy Friends: And, as a Proof of the good Will they bear thee, Have sent thee here a Grecian Enemy; A young and riotous Nobleman of Athens. Zimon. Hah! Herald. Who, with others his Associates, All in the Fever of their youthful Blood, Was seiz'd in Combination even now To have forc'd thy House, and spoil'd thee of thy Daughter. Zimon. Oh, my Hesione!— Herald. The Senate waves The Course of Justice, and delivers up Th' Offender to thy Sentence—bring him forth! Omphales within. Unhand me! by the Gods, I'm basely wrong'd! SCENE VII. Enter Omphales (struggling with the Guards) to Zimon, Ammon, and the Herald. Zimon. Release him! [To the Guards. Omphales. Where's the Wretch whose treach'rous Heart The warmest Friendship, and the strongest Vows Cou'd not secure from Falshood? he who shar'd My Heart, and Fortunes, yet seduc'd me forth, That in my Absence he might steal away My only valued Treasure? Ammon. Such a Wretch Shou'd Ammon be!—if Vengeance is thy Thirst, Come on! and meet an Opposite, whose Hopes Are not in Victory!— [Draws. Omphales. So desperate? Then thus—and so I pay thy Perjuries! [Wrests his Sword from one of the Guards. [They fight: Ammon is driven off. SCENE VIII. Omphales returns instantly to Zimon and the Herald. This Arm has justly minister'd thy Fate! Our Enemy's no more: but where's that Friend, That faithful, beauteous Friend? she who was wont With Smiles of Love to welcome my Return From greater Conquests, and a nobler Foe? Zimon. Oh, name her not! if thou hast Pow'r, forget her! Omphales. And art thou then still deaf to all our Pray'rs? Zimon. Alas, Omphales! wretched, injur'd Youth! Had Zimon known, what now too late he mourns, As soon he wou'd have shun'd his Foe in War! Or pierc'd the dearest Corner of his Heart! As soon have trampled on the Laws of Heav'n, As e'er have torn thee from Hesione! Pleas'd, I had crown'd your long, and faithful Loves, Fondly each Day beheld your Joys increase, Deceiving so th' Infirmities of Age, 'Till the late Hour of Fate! Omphales. What may this mean? Zimon. Demand no more! Omphales. Heav'n, guard Hesione! Zimon. Hah!—turn thee there!—Oh, ye immortal Pow'rs! Omphales. Alas! then it is plain! the Cause is plain! And Harmony itself is now untun'd! SCENE IX. Enter Hesione distracted to Zimon, Omphales, and the Herald. Hesione. Hark!—'twas the midnight Raven!— Omphales. Guard her, Heav'n! Hesione. Dost thou not hear it?—hence, Ill-boader, hence!— —Nay, tell me not! there's Treach'ry! Treach'ry! —What?—Ammon?—out! I'll hear no more of that! —Soft! soft!—the Hour is almost come!—'tis dark! Heav'n sees me not! I'll steal him from the Gods! Omphales. Hesione—! [Taking her by the Hand, and looking affectionately on her. Hesione. Away!—I'll to my Love!— Villainy! rank Villainy!—nay, 'twill out!— —Sure I shall meet him soon. Omphales. Behold him here Omphales here!— Hesione. When shall I die indeed? Omphales. Live, and be happy long within these Arms— [Embracing her. Hesione. Omphales— [Recovering. Omphales. 'Tis Omphales speaks to thee!— Hesione. Far off, methinks, I hear the Charmer's Voice! —'Tis he! Omphales self! Omphales. Now shall I grow Wild in my Turn, and mad with Extasy! The Gods at length reward our faithful Loves! Hesione. Alas, Omphales—'tis too powerful!— There is no Room for Hope! Omphales. No more of this! Enough of Sorrow we've already known! Long Joy succeeds! Hesione. Oh, think no more of Joy! Omphales. What means my Love? Hesione. Oh!—I am cold to Death!— Your Presence chears me yet—if you survive, And in an happy Maid forget a true one, May she adore you with a Love like mine! Omphales. Alas! again she raves!— Zimon. Wou'd it were so!— Hesione. My solemn Vow, Omphales!—it is past! —I've ta'en the fatal Draught. Omphales. What do I hear?— Ye Pow'rs, defend my Soul from instant Madness! Hesione. If I have been in haste—when we shall meet In endless Peace—you surely may forgive—I I can no more— [Dies. Zimon. Oh, fatal Constancy! Omphales. I was a Partner in that solemn Vow! [Recovering from his Astonishment. —And thus I share it! [Falls on his Sword by her. Zimon. Send me Patience, Heav'n!— Omphales. Ev'n Death is here inviting!—be it thus With our Remains—One Urn will hold our Ashes— [Dies. Zimon. I shall not long survive these heavy Ills!— Tho' Life becomes a Load too great, to bear, Let us not murmur yet; but thank the Gods, 'Tis in our Choice to die!—But let it pass!— Now for the State—the Cause of these our Ills [To the Herald. They soon shall learn—bear thou my Answer thus! Tell 'em I'll go—but never to return! That I may conquer—but not live to triumph! That I, whom Glory, and the Cause of Greece Were wont to summon to the dusty Field, Am now call'd forth by Desperation, The Spur of Cowards! for I am sick of Life, And wou'd no more look out upon the Day; Then I demand this Boon! when they at large Have heard th' Offenders Crimes, that they inflict A rig'rous Justice on the impious Tryphon. And lastly give 'em these Instructions from me! When they shall hear a smooth, and forward Tongue Descant on Heaven from a Face like Tryphon's, That they look round, and arm against Destruction: That to be kind is dang'rous: that they trust To Heav'n alone; for Heav'n alone is just! [Exeunt omnes. The End of the Fifth ACT. EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. PORTER. If in th' Attempt you've found our Author fail, Yet cease, severer Criticks, cease to rail! Too well be knew, he could but faintly show, How Poets pleas'd two thousand Years ago; Nor vainly did presume to rival those Whose Fame has ever liv'd, and ever grows. Let abler Bards to such great Aims aspire, And equal what he only can admire; Contented if he shows the arduous Height, And calls forth others to maintain the Flight, Far better pleas'd in Search of Truth to stray, Than gain false Glory by a surer Way. Think, he offends in no inglorious Cause; And all his Benefit is your Applause. For his own Pleasure first these Scenes were made; If he has pleas'd You too, he's doubly paid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some Fragments of NERO, a Tragedy lost. I. Ambition is a lawless Thirst of Fame, An eager Race after an empty Shade, And Grandeur is but Misery adorn'd; It at a Distance glares, and is ador'd: Draw near, th' Illusion ceases to deceive, The superficial Gilding wears away, And leaves the Idol naked to our View. II. Love is a little, sly, designing Knave, And meanly steals his Conquests o'er our Minds, While Reason's lull'd to Sleep by Idleness; But when we rouse, and boldly charge the God, The Coward flies, and we're our selves again. III. 'Tis well! sleep on: the Hours that Wretches sleep, Are stol'n from Misery— IV. Why dost thou start? of what art thou afraid? It is a beaten Road which leads to Death: My Father pointed out the Way to me, And his Forefather mark'd his Passage hence. V. How kind are Tyrants, when they wou'd destroy: While yet we live, 'tis in their Pow'r to pain; But when the friendly Stroke of Death is o'er, What do their Chains, and Tortures then avail? VI. Men call me Tyrant, so, in Truth, I am; But chiefly to my self—why then reform! —'Tis now too late!—Furies, and Hell—who's there? Alone I am too many for my self. VII. —Virtue is its own Reward, And now rewarded only by it self; A precious fewel, whose transcendent Worth Is known, but to those few who bosom it; Its Pow'r can disappoint the Tyrant's Rage, And weary Punishment; the Gods infuse A hidden Balsam in its sufferings, To mitigate their Pains: So just is Heav'n! VIII. Let us not meet Misfortunes; 'tis too soon To feel them, when they come— IX. Man's highest Wisdom is of small Account; He sees, at best, as thro' a clouded Glass, Erroneous Forms, and the false Shapes of Things. X. Shou'd ev'n the Gods themselves from Heav'n descend, Mix with Mankind, and trifle here on Earth, No Altars wou'd be rais'd, no Incense smoak; The Creature their Creator wou'd despise, And soon forget to whom they owe their Being. XI. It is a Maxim in the Art of Love, Which all shou'd learn, who wou'd successful prove, That Women still disdain the prostrate Prize, But follow still, whene'er the Lover flies; They frown, while Man submissively complains, Or laugh at the poor Wretch, who buggs his Chains: Let him but struggle for his Liberty, At the Expence of their's they'll set him free. XII. To the Unhappy Death at any Time In any Shape is welcome: What sick Man Consults the Garb of his Physician? XIII. When Fear has once thrown Reason from her Seat, Unbridled Fancy reigns without Controul, And hurries us to Madness— XIV. At length the proudest Fair must be subdu'd; For she who gains each Day a thousand Hearts, Has still a Heart to lose— Design'd for an Epilogue to a Tragedy call'd the Revenge. 'Tis well a Southern Clime our Scene supplies, Where Passions with superiour Ardour rise, Where the fond Spouse dares venture to inquire, And the chast Wife, to prove her Truth, expire! A British Husband, and suspect! nay, dye, A willing Martyr to his Jealousy! That were a Farce indeed! and an Offence Against our Country's Breeding, and good Sense! And what kind, squeamish Dame of this frank Nation E'er gave up Life, to clear her Reputation? No! here th' experienc'd Pair, like Sharpers, meet, Both arm'd alike, and both resolv'd to cheat, While the fair Nymph consents, but to be free, And wears the Yoke for greater Liberty. But if, amidst the Herd, some Churl we find; Not absolutely to her Faults resign'd, To her first Error he may yet be kind. But if th' imprudent Sot his Shame will spread; What's the dire Vengeance for his sprouting Head? Why, what she most desires—a sep'rate Bed. Let none then here of Hymen's Bonds complain, Howe'er he treats his Votaries in Spain, In ev'ry Point our Freedom we maintain. Part of the Epilogue to a Comedy call'd the Masquerade. Heavens! what Alteration wou'd be here, Shou'd ye to Night in your true Forms appear? But of your real Shapes you're all afraid; And the whole World is one great Masquerade. The Courtier's smile, the Hero's dreadful Air, The Virgin's Frown, the Widow's deep Despair, And solemn Coxcomb's venerable Face Are useful Vizards all, and meer Grimace; And wisest, bravest, safest, happiest Are they, whose borrow'd Masks conceal them best. This was mislay'd, or wou'd have been inserted at the 125th Page. EPISTLE X. To a Friend with ? Before these Sheets the Press's Weight shall feel, For after that we can have no Appeal, Deign to peruse them with a careful Eye, And lop the Branches, lest the Tree shou'd dye. Whate'er luxuriant Fancy paints too strong, Relentless blot, and shorten, what's too long: Wheree'er she fails, the empty Spaces fill, And graft upon the Stock with friendly Skill; Tho' rarely Fancy does her Aid refuse, And more are lost from knowing not to choose. O had I that Simplicity and Grace, Which pleas'd, e'er Art did Nature's Charms deface, In those our great Originals of Yore, Whom distant I pursue, and you adore! Yet Nature pure, unveil'd cou'd we present, How might we hope, to give the Age Content, Or Censure 'scape in these affected Times, When Poetry's scarce known, but by her Rhimes, When Bards, as of Sterility afraid, Croud all together Man e'er thought, or said, Heap Words, on Words, to multiply in haste, And think, no Ornament can be misplac'd? So it be fine, they care not, where 'tis found. Their Labours like a Planter's Nurs'ry Ground, Where Trees are in a wild Disorder thrown, And Seeds of every Kind confus'dly sown. No Matter! so my Lines you shou'd approve, And a few more such Friends, whose Truth we love. But now, tho' you may find, I've shot too wide, And miss'd my Aim, fear not an Author's Pride! Be bold, and free! for tho' the Offspring's mine, I will not, like the Ape, suppose it fine. FINIS.</field>
