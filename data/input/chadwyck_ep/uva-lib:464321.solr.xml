      <field name="fulltext">The following poems are scored for music in the source text. Where poems are not stanzaic, no attempt has been made to reconstruct the metrical lines. Variations for different voices have been ignored. Repetition marks have been ignored. To the ever honoured Dr JOHN WILSON on his incomparable Book of Ballads. Not as a bush to thy more noble wine. Doe we prefix these lines; what ever's thine Commends it selfe; we pay our homage, due To this diviner science and to you: Did Orpheus Harpe cause beasts to dance, thine more Thy loftier strains draw love from them, before Did hate thy art and thee: this wonder shall Raise thee to be a God, make him to fall. Sure some Intelligence was sent from Jove T'acquaint thee with the Harmony above; How else with such composure are we blest. 'Tis Angells Musick though in Mortalls dresse Those low and creeping words we Ballads call Thy powre has raisd to be cœlestiall. O prodigie of nature that couldst keep Thy soul in tune, when all the world was deep In discord: it's then time, for thee to set Some sprightly Ayre, when there's most need of it. When sacred Anthems ceased, and in stead Of that more heavenly Musick, did succeed Nothing but barking tones, when Organs were By Trumpets silenc'd, then blown from the Quire; Thou, borne to humour all, out of thy braine Full fraught with melodye, didst hatch this traine Of songs, from whose sweet concord always runs Full streames of harmelesse mirth t'Apollo's sons. These Charme our senses make our souls to dwell Upon our ears, there to keep Sentinell. Heer's Musick for the mean'st capacity, And for the skillful'st too deep Harmony: Hold still your penns then, cease for to rehearse WILSON's deserved praise in untun'd verse. And learne to sing those notes which rightly hit, Speake more to's honour than th'accutest wit. Proceed Harmonious soul, in this thine art. More of thy Musick still to us impart, For in these sheets thou shalt embalmed be, And live a WILSON to Eternity. To my honoured friend Dr WILSON on His Musicall Ayres, and incomparable Skill on the Lute. Could wise Pithagoras tast thy skill; Or drown'd in numbers drink his fill; Could he but revel't in thy Ayre One houre, he'd sweare thy soul is there. Thou'lt tempt, (take but thy Lute in hand,) Euridice againe to Land; Who Ravisht with one carelesse glance, May safely venture t'other dance On fatall Serpents, lul'd in th'armes Of thy soft notes they'l need no charmes. Labour but on thy strings, they'l throng Themselves into a Swans last song; Where every note will ring the knell Of some dead baffled Philomel. E. D. ex Æde Christi On that incomparable Master of Musick Dr WILSON. Sir, such in sounds your skill's, that while you're here, Oxfords not only Englands eye but Eare: So at a shake of yours our passions flow, As if you reacht our Heartstrings with your Bow, Touch your Theorboe, and round all our souls Like Unisons the restlesse Quaver rouls, Your The old Rhetorick Schole now assigned for the Musick lecture. Schoole did never so deserve its name, As since your ravishing Rhetorick thither came, No lofty style like Ela can command, No Figures like the postures of your Hand, How have I seen, souls melting through the Eyes, Ears chaind, tongues silent at your Melodies. Like Orpheus Rivers, Beasts, Stones, Birds you move, When Tears, &amp; wrath, Fiercenesse, and Winged Love Follow your Tunes, such Majesty attends Your strokes, that Law comes from your Fingers ends, The Spartans Musick made them fight &amp; die, Your's would have made them to graspe Victorie. No wonder then if Poets find their Feet, When with such all Commanding notes they meet. Praise is an Echo to good deeds, then fit It is, good Musick should have most of it. A. C. To his honoured Friend Dr JOHN WILSON upon his most excellent Book of Ayres. Lend my Muse wings and with them I will dare, To soare aloft in your much clearer Ayre. Where your harmonious sphere is known to move With sweeter Accents then those doe above. Did now Promethius live hee'd find a way, Not only for to animate meere Clay. Heed aske for pure Ayre not for Jove's fire, That he might some harmonious soules inspire. Musick's compleatest parts you here have set, Only that wee might find them more compleat, Toth' envy of our Nation here you shew, Musicks perfection perfected by you. To the great Master of Musick Dr J. WILSON upon his most excellent Book of Ayres. The soul's a Symphony: Th'harmonious blast, The perfect Ayre of the great Protoplast. No wonder then if thy Diviner Note Betray my soul, make mine invention dote. Stir'd by thy Musick from each melting string, Didst thou not Cheat me of my soule, I'de sing, I'de Praise thy Vertues; but thy sweetest Quire, Bids me give audience only, and Admire. Each stroake speaks WILSON and whoever plays Sings a new Anthem to his lasting praise. 'Tis WILSON speakes, each neatly-warbled straine Is but the Echo of th'inventors braine. Not Death, nor Time can e're eclipse thy Fame, While each string, from thy Book, thus sounds thy Name. Ne're feare Oblivion then: Thy Glory shall, Know none, but what's the worlds great Funerall. N. M. To my honoured Friend JOHN WILSON Doctor of Musick, on his excellent Book of Ayres. As Friends do meet whom nobler love hath joyn'd And made (though sev'rall bodies, yet) one mind, Who count themselves to live, not 'cause they move And have a being but because they love; Who when they view, think all their soules i'th' eye. Or if they touch, think it i'th' hand to lye: So doe I meet your Ayres, they have the art Of drawing all my soule into that part Which they affect, and if I chance to heare Them strook am forc'd to wish my selfe all eare. I doe not wonder that the King did When some of these Ayres were presented to him by Dr Wilson Mr Low, and others. call, WILSON, ther's more words, let's heare them all. Such was your skill, that what the rest o'th' Court Perhaps thought long, Judicious eares thought short. Excellent Artist! whose sweet straines devoure Time swift as they, and make dayes seem an houre. But what need more, since 'tis enough to tell But this, King Charles hath heard, and lik'd them well. J. H. O. C. To that Excellent Musitian the AUTHOR. 'Tis well the Musick of the rowling Sphæres Doth not arive to prepossesse our eares; That they may entertaine thy Nobler Layes; Which might embody'd Angels charme, and raise Woods into Trances. Let none that at least Hath not a Siren Templ'd in his breast, Pollute thy songs, And in whose every note A Quire of Muses playes about his throat: That may call out the soule and make it run In a Triumphant Chariot 'bove the Sun. Could others but discerne that Golden vaine Of Art, those Graces that breath in each straine Of thy composures, then they might know what (In part) to judge oth' Learned travaile that Teaches thy notes to command Raptures so: But by that selfe-concealing art (we know) Thine eyes are priviledg'd in thy frames to spye Those silken strings, that fine Embrodery. To my worthy Friend that incomparable Musitian Dr JOHN WILSON on his Book of Songs of three Parts Why should I loade with barren praise A head so often wreath'd with Bayes: Or make the greedy Reader looke For something good besides the Book? These dirty lines the rest will soyle. And hardly serve to be their foyle, Yet since the Author will impart Unto the gaping world his Art; I'le let it know what it ne're thought, What can't be learned may be bought; Least men inestimable call It still and so not buy't at all. Thus o're faire Structures of't we set A Bill, this House is to be Let: Some too perhaps who yet ne're knew Great WILSON what we owe to you; When they shall on the Title page. See Ballads first come on the Stage. Will thinke, because the word so grosse is. These songs are fit for Market Crosses: I'le tell'um they're authentick grown, And Rimers now put Poets downe. And yet I will the Muses call, Apollo, and the Poets all, And bid them tell me if they e're Had better Offrings then are here, Call any Nobler (if they durst) Since they frequented Hibla first: Some humane, More divine; the odds Is this, men made some, More the Gods. Thus in a day serene and cleare, Some sullen clouds fixt here and there Make angry Phebus mend his ray And add more luster to the day. Thus in fayre nights the Heavens are Not set with one continued starre, But here and there a patch of night Doth recompence the rest with light. Now could the trembling aire convey These sounds where Troys foundations lay; Each scatterd stone would shew his head, Though long in ruines buryed; And being ravisht leap to take The station which it did forsake: And thou (Brave WILSON) with thy hand Amphion like shouldst charming stand; So should each higher note have powre For to erect a lofty Towre And when a deeper tone should sound, To sinck a Cellar vnder ground; Then might I question which would tell Lowder thy Fame, Quart pot or Bell. I've done, 'tis time the Reader see The difference 'twixt Thee and Mee: I'le only say thy sacred brow Shall not be crown'd with Laurell now, Stay then till wee together can Thy Master Crowne and Thee his Man. R. R. [When Troy Towne] When Troy Towne for ten years warre withstood the Greeks in manfullwise When Troy Towne for ten years warre withstood the Greeks in manfullwise, yet did their foes increase so fast, that to resist none could suffice, Waste lye those Walls that were so good and Corne now growes where Troy Towne stood. [From the faire Lavinian Shore] From the faire Lavinian Shore From the faire Lavinian Shore, I your Markets come to store, Muse not though so farr I dwell and my wares come here to sell. Such is the sacred hunger of gould then come to my pack while I cry what d'ye lack what d'ye buy for here it is to be sold. [Will you buy any Honesty] Will you buy any Honesty come away Will you buy any Honesty come away, I sell it openly by day, I bring no forced lights nor Candle to cozen you come buy and handle, This will shew the great Man good, the Tradesman where he sweares and lyes, the Lady of a Noble blood, the Citty Dame to rule her Eyes, You are Rich men now, come buy and then I will make you richer honest honest men. [Full fathome five] Full fathome five thy Father lyes Full fathome five thy Father lyes, of his bones are Corrall made those are pearles that were his eyes, nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a Sea change into something rich and strange. Sea Nymphs hourly ring his knell, Hark now I heare them Ding Dong Bell Ding Dong Ding Dong Bell [Where the Bee sucks] Where the Bee sucks there suck I Where the Bee sucks there suck I, in a Cowslips Bell I lye there I couch When Owles doe cry, on the Batts Back I doe fly, after Summer merrily. Merrily Merrily shall I live now under the Blossome that hangs on the Bough Merrily Merrily shall I live now, under the Blossome that Hangs on the Bough. [When Love with unconfined wings] When Love with unconfined wings hovers within my gates When Love with unconfined wings hovers within my gates And My Divine Althea brings to whisper at my Grates. When I lye tangled in her haire, and Fetter'd in her eye, The Birds that wanton in the Ayre, Know no such Liberty. [Have you any work for the Sowgelder hoe] Have you any work for the Sowgelder hoe Have you any work for the Sowgelder hoe, My horne goes to high to lowe To lowe. Have you any Piggs Calves or Colts Have you any Lambs in your holts to cut for the stone, here comes a cunning one Have you any Brauches to Spay'd or e're a fayre Mayde, that would be a Nun, come Kisse mee 'tis done. Hark how my merry horne doth blow, to high to lowe To high to lowe, to lowe. [Come hither you that Love] Come hither you that Love Come hither you that Love, and heare me sing of Joyes still growing greene Fresh and Lusty as the pride of Spring and ever blowing, Come hither youths that Blush and dare not know what is desire, and old men worse then you that Cannot blow one sparke of Fire, And with the power of my Enchanting Song Boyes shall be able men and old and ould men young. [Young Thirsis lay in Phillis lap] Young Thirsis lay in Phillis lap Young Thirsis lay in Phillis lap, and gazing on her eye priz'd life too Meane for such good hap and fayne the Lad would dye. When Phillis who the Force did prove of Love as well as he. Cry'd to him stay a while my Love and I will dye with thee. So did these happy Lovers dye, but with so little Paine that Both to Life immediately returne to dye againe. [Kawasha comes in Majesteé] Kawasha comes in Majesteé Kawasha comes in Majesteé, was never such a god as hee He is come from a farr Cuntreé To make our nose a Chimneé a Chimneé: Silænus Asse doth Leere to see, this well appointed Companeé. A Hey a Hey a Hey for and a Hoe, a Hey for and a Hoe Wee'le make this great Potan Drinke off Silænus Cann, And when that he well drunke is returne him turne him to his Munkey's from whence he came. The Worthy's they were nine 'tis true, and lately Arthurs Knights we Knew. But now are come up of Worthies new, the Roaring Boyes Kawasha's Crew Kawasha's crew. But if Silænus Asse should bray, 'twould make them Roare and run away. A Hey a Hey a Hey for and a Hoe, a Hey for and a Hoe Wee'le make Sylen fall downe, and cast him in a Swoune. To see our men of Ire of all Snuffing Puffing Smoake and Fire like fell Dragoone. More Insence Hath been burned at great Kawasha's foot, then to Sylen or Bacchus Both, or take in Jove to boote. Wherefore then yeeld or quit the field. [Cast your Capps and Cares away] Cast your Capps and Cares away Cast your Capps and Cares away, this is the Beggers Holiday, At the Crowning of our King, Thus we ever Dance and Sing: Be it Peace or be it Warre, Here at Liberty we are, And enjoy our Ease and Rest, To the Fields wee are not Prest, Nor are Call'd into the Towne, To be troubled with a Gowne. All which happinesse he Braggs, He doth owe unto his Raggs. In the world look out and see, where's so happy a King as he, Where the Nation live so free, And so happy as doe wee: Hang all Officers we cry, And the Magistrates too by, When the Subsidy's encreast, Wee are not a Penny Ceast, Nor will Any goe to Law, With a Begger for a Straw. [Doe not feare to put thy feet] Doe not feare to put thy feet Doe not feare to put thy feet, Naked in the River sweet. Think not Neute, nor Leech, nor Toade, will bite thy foote when thou hast trode: Nor let the Waters rising high, nor as thou wad'st in make thee Cry and sob, but ever live with mee, and not a wave shall trouble thee. [Thoughts doe not vexe me while I Sleepe] Thoughts doe not vexe me while I Sleepe; Griefe do not doe not move mee, Smile not false hope while I weepe Shee cannot love mee, Had I been as cold and Nice, and as often turning, then as shee had I been Ice, and Shee as I now burning. Teares flow no more from my swolne eyes, Sighes doe not so oppresse mee, Stop not your Eares at my Cryes, O but release mee. Were you but as sad as I, And as full of mourning, Very griefe would make you dye, At least, leave off your scorning. [Who so complaineth gaineth oft Loves just reward] Who so complaineth Who so complaineth gaineth oft Loves just reward. Who so refraineth paineth dyeing Sans regard, then will I make a vertue of my needing And spare no speech since words cause Loves best speeding, O you sad lines Proceeding bleeding, shew my grev'd heart's exceeding needing. Tell her My sad story, will impaire her glory, If shee smile when I am sorry. [Come Silent night and in thy gloomy shade] Come Silent night and in thy gloomy shade Come Silent night and in thy gloomy shade hide my dispaire all those that Trade with griefe doe hate reliefe, and can think nothing faire but thy dark Mantle, in whose misty Ayre Contemning breath they grope for death Oh: come and stay, banish the light-some day, the harmes that are not seene Be but as though they had not been. [Come Constant Hearts that so prevaile] Come Constant Hearts that so prevaile Come Constant Hearts that so prevaile, that ev'ry passion putts in baile, my Innocence shall dare as farr, to give the Tyrant open warre, if warm'd with pride he kindle fires Wee'le drowne them in our chast desires: If he Assaile with Dart or Bow Weele hide them in these hills of Snow, so shall his heart plagu'd Mourne and dye, While wee smile at his memory and Keep our Hearts our Eyes our Eares free From vaine Sighs, sad sad groanes and Tears. [Love and disdaine dwells in my Mistress eyes] Love and disdaine dwells in my Mistress eyes Love and disdaine dwells in my Mistress eyes, contending which of them shall first destroy me, Th'one with his restlesse flames my bosome fryes Th'other no lesse doth with his Ice annoy mee. Dearest, since these conclude that I must dye, will you not mourne at my sad Obsequie. [In a season all oppressed] [1] In a season all oppressed, With sad sorrowes poore distressed, Troylous said unto his Cressed Yeeld O yeeld thee sweet and stay not, O no no no no no No no no Sweet Love I may not. 2 Strife in Love is Loves uniting, These hands were not made for fighting, But for mutuall hearts delighting, Yeeld O yeeld then sweet and stay not: O No No &amp;c. 3 Deare if you will still persever, In this No, which answers never Doe what I desire you ever. And againe say No, and spare not. O No No &amp;c. I dare not. 4 Since nor time nor place nor plaining, Can change this word of disdaining, What is there for mee remaining, But to dye, if you gainsay not. O No No &amp;c. I may not. [Cupid thou art a wanton Boy] Cupid thou art a wanton Boy Cupid thou art a wanton Boy, and heretofore mad'st Love a Toy, But in thy Raigne a Tyrant art, to Wound a Sheaperdesses heart: To make her Sigh, Swoune, Weepe, and Pale, Thus Sick yet modest will not Vaile; But cryes out Hymen 'tis your cure, For the blind Boy I'le ne're endure. [Though your strangenesse fretts my heart] Though your strangenesse fretts my heart, Yet may not I Complaine, You perswade me 'tis but Art, That secret Love must feigne. If another you affect, 'Tis but a shew t'avoyd suspect, Is this faire excusing, O no all is abusing. When another holds your hand, You sweare I have your heart: When my Rivalls close doe stand, And I stand farre apart. They enjoy you every one, Yet must I seeme your friend alone; Is this faire excusing, O no all is abusing. [Aske mee no more whether doth stray] Aske mee no more whether doth stray Those golden Attoms of the day, For in pure Love the Heavens prepare, That powder to enrich thy hayre, Aske me no More where those starres light, That downeward shoote in dead of night, For in thine Eyes they set and there, Fixed become as in their Spheare Aske me no more where Jove bestowes When June is gone the flaming Rose, For in thy beautyes Orient deepe, All flowres as in their causes sleepe. Nor aske me more if East or West The Phœnix builds her Spicie Nest, For unto thee at last shee flies And in thy fragrand bosome dyes. [Clora's false Love made Clora weepe] Clora's false Love made Clora weepe, And by a Rivers side, Her flocks which She was wont to keepe Neglected thus shee cry'd. Is't not injustice O yee Gods To kindle my desires, And to leave His at so much odds, As there's no mutuall fires. Poore victory to pierce a Heart that was a tender one, But Cowardize to spare your dart from his that was a stone. As shee thus mourn'd the teares that fell Downe from her Love-sick eyes Did in the Waters dropp and swell, And into bubbles rise. Wherein her blubber'd face appeares, Now out alas said shee, How doe I melt away in teares, For him that Loves not mee. Yet as I lessen Multiplie, But in lesse forme appeare, Thus doe I languish from mine eye, And grow new in my teare. Breake not the Christall circles mee Sweet streames by your fayre side, My Love perhapps may walking bee, And I may be espied. And thus in little drawne and drest In a sad teares attire, May force such passions from his breast, Shall equall my desire. [I love (alas) but cannot shew it] I love (alas) but cannot shew it I keep a fire that burnes within Rake't up in Embers Ah could shee know it, I might perhaps be Lov'd agen, For a true Love may Justly call For friendship Love reciprocall. Some Gentle Courteous winde betray mee A Sigh, by whispering in her Eare, Or let a piteous shower convey mee And drop into her breast a teare, Or two or more, the hardest flint By often dropps receives a dint. Shall I then vexe my heart and rend it That is allready too too weake; No no they say Lovers may send it By wrighting what they cannot speake, Goe then my Muse and let this verse Bring back my life or else my Hearse. [If I dye, be this my will] If I dye, be this my will If I dye, be this my will, Let my spirit serve thee still, and desire if not fulfill Thy whole pleasure so approving, Death is not the end of Loving. Let the Earth my Body have whence it sprung, there be my grave, Only the remembrance Have of my Image; Let death never, me from thy Acquaintance sever The last Breath my Tongue shall move, be the Ayrie forme of Love, And despight of death approve (lifes privation thus defying) if not dead I love thee dying. [Greedy Lover pause a while] Greedy Lover pause a while, And remember that a Smile heretofore Would have made thy hopes a feast, which is more Since thy dyet was increast, Then both Looks and Language too, Or the face it selfe can doe Such a province Is my Hand As if it thou couldst command heretofore There thy lipps would Seem to dwell which is more Ever since they sped so well, Then they can be brought to Doe, By my neck and bosome too. If the center of my breast, A dominion unpossest heretofore May thy wandring thought suffice seeke no more, And my heart shall Be thy prize, So thou Keep above the Line, All the Hemispheare is thine. If the flames of love were pure, Which by Oath thou didst assure Here-to-fore, Gold that goes into the cleere shines the more. When it leaves agen the fire, Let not then those looks of thine Blemish what they should refine. I have cast into the fire Almost all thou could'st desire Here-to-fore, But I see thou art to crave More and more; Should I cast in all I have, So that were I ne're so free, Thou would'st burn, though not for mee. [Thine eyes to mee like Sunnes appeare] Thine eyes to mee like Sunnes appeare Thine eyes to mee like Sunnes appeare or brighter starres their light whih Makes it Summer all the yeare, Or else a day of Night. But truely I doe Think they are but eyes, and neither Sunne nor Starre. [Awake Awake the Morne will never rise] Awake Awake the Morne will never rise Awake Awake the Morne will never rise, 'till shee can dresse her Beauties at thine eyes. The Larke forsakes her watry nest and mounting Shakes her dewy wings taking thy window for the East, and as shee Climbes aloft shee sings, Awake awake the Morne will never rise 'till shee Can dresse her Bauties at thine eyes. The Merchant bowes unto the Sea-mans Starre, The Plow-man from the Sunne his Season takes, Only the Lover wonders what they are who seeke for light before his Mistres wakes. Awake awake the Morne will never rise, 'till shee can dresse her beauties at thine eyes. [I would have thee Merry, Laugh] I would have thee Merry, Laugh, and Smile I would have thee Merry, Laugh, and Smile, and then look grave and sad, In ev'ry humour but a while make Love as 'tis that's Mad, I would have thy dresse in Severall drapes, like Proteus carv'd, not he, in humour a meer Jack-an-apes, then a grave Monkey be. [In The merry Month of May] [1] In The merry Month of May, On a Morne by breake of day Forth I Walked the woods so wide, When as May was in her pride, There I spyed all alone Philliday with Coridon. 2 Much a doe there was god wot, He could Love but shee could not, His Love Hee said was ever true, Nor was mine e're false to you. He said he had Lov'd her long, Shee said Love should have no wrong. 3 Coridon would Kisse her then, Shee said Maids must kisse no men 'Till they kist for good and all, Then Shee made the Shepheards call: All the godds to witnesse sooth Ne're was lov'd a fairer youth. 4 Then with many a pretty Oath As yea and nay and faith and troath, Such as silly Sheapheards use When they will not Love abuse, Love that had been long deluded, Was with kisses sweet concluded: And Philliday with Garlands gay Was crown'd the Lady of the May. [Faine would I Cloris whom my heart adores] Faine would I Cloris whom my heart adores Faine would I Cloris whom my heart adores, longer a while between thine Armes remaine, But loe the Jealous morne Her Rosy doores to Spight mee opes and brings the day againe. Farewell farewell Cloris 'tis time I Dy'de, the Night departs yet still my woes abide. [Deere give mee a thousand kisses pay the dept] Deere give mee a thousand kisses Deere give mee a thousand kisses pay the dept thy Lipps doe owe Let the number of those Blisses to ten thousand thousand grow, 'till to infinites they Flow. Let the sweet perfum'd treasure of thy breath my Spirits fill, so enjoying endlesse pleasures, breaths rebreathing let us still, breathe one Breath, and wish one will. [Lawne as white as driven Snow] Lawne as white as driven Snow Lawne as white as driven Snow, Cypresse black as ere was Crow, Gloves as sweet as Damaske Roses, Maskes for Faces and for Noses, Bugle Braceletts Necklace Amber, Perfumes for a Ladyes Chamber, Golden Coyfes and stomachers for my Ladds, for To give their Deer's Pinns and Poting sticks Pinns And poting sticks of steele what Maids lack what What from head to heele, what Come buy of mee come, Come buy come buy, buy Ladds or else your Lasses cry come buy. [Goe weather-beaten thoughts with stormes of teares] Goe weather-beaten thoughts Goe weather-beaten thoughts with stormes of teares that issue From your selfe conceived sorrow, prize her hard heart, presse her unwilling eares to Heare my nights unrest my grieving Morrow. Tell her the harbour where your Selves doe dwell, is my poore heart whereon you beate so sore, as does the clapper on a restles bell Ring for the soules that wee shall see no more. And sighs make knowne my will is made to her, to her that hath my heart for Legacy. Then burst your swellings home And in smoake vade, to be a witnesse to the standers by, that they may testify How much I Lov'd her, and shee repent that all this never mov'd her. [Goe restlesse thoughts fly from your Masters breast] Goe restlesse thoughts fly from your Masters breast Goe restlesse thoughts fly from your Masters breast, and seeke out her that Causeth thus my griefe, presse to her heart, letting it never rest untill from her you bring with You reliefe. Tell her you come from one, that's deadly sick a bleeding heart Whose wounds cannot be healed by any others pollicy or witt, but by a Love which hath been long concealed, Pitty perchance may move this sweet effect, and change her minde into some better moode. Pray heavens her favour So on you reflect, that in your suit you may be understood. Then must you Bridle your unruly tongue, and speake her praises and forget your wrong. [If my Lady bid beginne] If my Lady bid beginne If my Lady bid beginne, Shall I say No 'tis a sinne? If shee bidd mee Kisse and play, Shall I shrinke? Cold Foole away. If Shee clap my Cheekes and spye little Cupids in my eye gripe my hand and Stroake my haire, shall I like a faint heart feare. No, no, no, let those that Lye in dismall dungeons and would dye, dispaire and feare, Let those that Cry they are forsaken and would flye, quit their fortunes mine Are free, Hope makes mee Hardy, so does Shee. [Tell mee where the beauty lyes] Tell mee where the beauty lyes in my Mistresse Tell mee where the beauty lyes in my Mistresse, or mine eyes, is shee fayre I made her so, Beauty doth from likeing grow. Be shee fayrer whiter than Venus Doves or Leda's Swanne, What's that Beauty if neglected, seen of all, of None respected. Then let my Mistresse that I love her, think her fayre Cause I approve Her. [Boast not blind boy that I'me thy prize] Boast not blind boy that I'me thy prize, 'Twas not thy Dart But those that Feather'd with her eyes First strooke my heart. Th'ill tuter'd shafts and Childish Bow, On faintly loving hearts bestowe. I Vaunt my flame and dare defye Those Bugbeare fires, Which only serve to terrify Fooles fond desires: Hoard up for such thy painted flame, As tremble when they heare thy name. My heart thy fire nor shafts could pierce, But holy flashes, Swifter then lightning and more fierce, Burnt mine to ashes; Where lett them sleepe in unknown rest, Since Fate concludes their Urne her breast. [Come thou Father of the Spring] Come thou Father of the Spring Come thou Father of the Spring: Come Zephirus, and while we sing Spread thy Nectar-dewed wings over all this place below, that from hence such Sweet may grow, Hybla shall envy at the shew, that the Nymphs and higher Powers may cast their eyes out at their Bowers, and descend to pluck thy Flowers, Whence a rich perfume shall rise, to swell the Ayre and pierce the Skies Sweeter then a Sacrifice. [Sir this my little Mistresse here] Sir this my little Mistresse here Sir this my little Mistresse here, did ne're pretend to Peters Chaire, nor Any Triple Crowne did weare, and yet shee is a Pope. No Benefice shee ever sold, nor Pardon, nor dispence for Gold, shee Scarcely is a quarter old, and yet shee is a Pope. No Kings her Feet did ever Kisse, or had worse looks from Her then this. Nor doth shee ever Hope, to Saint men with the Rope, and yet shee is a Pope. A female Pope, you'l say a second Joane, but sure this is Pope Innocent or none. [No No I tell thee no] No No I tell thee no No No I tell thee no, Though from thee I Must goe, Yet my Heart saies not so. It swears by Stella's eyes, in whose darting surprize It in Loves fetters lies. It swears by those Roses and Lillies so White, And those Rubies so Bright, Ne're to part ne're to part from my Deare deare delight. [For ever let thy heavenly Tapers] For ever let thy heavenly Tapers on the Married brightly shine For ever let thy heavenly Tapers on the Married brightly shine And never may un-sacred vapours drowne those glorious flames of thine. O Hymen That their Hands, their Hands dost joyne untill thy Rayes to darknesse turne, With thy high Praise, with thy high praise, our hearts shall burne, our Hearts shall burne. [Fly hence shadowes that doe Keepe] Fly hence shadowes that doe Keepe Fly hence shadowes that doe Keepe watchfull sorrowes Charm'd in sleepe, Though the eyes be overtaken yet the heart doth ever waken, thoughts charm'd Up in busy snares of Continuall toyles and cares, Love and griefes are so exprest, That they rather sigh then rest. Fly hence shadowes that doe keepe watchfull Sorrows charm'd in sleepe, Watchfull sorrows charm'd in sleepe. [Since Love hath in thine and mine] [1] Since Love hath in thine and mine Eye Kindled a holy flame, What Pitty 'twere to let it dye, What sinne to quench the same. 2 The starres that seeme extinct by day, Disclose their flames at night, And in a Subtile sence convey Their Loves in beames of light. 3 So when the Jealous Eye and Eare, Are shut or turn'd a side: Our tongues, our Eyes may talke nor feare The being heard or spy'd. 4 What though our bodies cannot meete, Loves fuell's more divine, The fixt starres by their twinkling greete, And yet they never joyne. 5 Falle Meteors that doe change their place, Though they seem fair and bright, Yet when they covet to embrace, Fall downe and loose their light. 6 If thou perceive thy flame decay, Come light thine Eyes at mine: And when I feele mine fade away, I'le take new fire from thine. 7 Thus while wee shall preserve from wast, The flame of our desires, No Vestall shall maintaine more chast, Or more Immortall fires. [Since Love hath brought thee, and I have caught thee] [1] Since Love hath brought thee, and I have caught thee Here in this bower And at this Hower, Nor shall thy faynings, thy coy disdaynings Thy causelesse Chidings, thy short abidings, Thy crafty smilings thy quaint beguilings, Nor those thy struglings, with all thy juglings Shall make mee Leave thee No No thou shalt no more deceive mee. 2 See'st thou that fountaine, Under that Mountaine, Wat'ring those vallyes, Along whose allyes, Thou once did'st fly mee, when I did spye thee, Even in this Atire, Held by a Satyre: Under that Sapling, In a close grapling When I did threat him, and after beat him, And yet would'st leave mee, No, No, thou shalt no more deceive mee. 3 Then cease thy panting, And be not wanting, In those sweet graces, and deare embraces, Wherewith thou bindest, all that thou mindest, And fall a Billing, 'till I be willing, So to repay thee, that which may stay thee, And so delight thee, that to requite mee, Thou ne're wilt leave mee, Nor ever offer to deceive mee. [You Heraulds of my Mistresse heart] You Heraulds of my Mistresse heart You Heraulds of my Mistresse heart, beauties fairest jewell, to mee her Passions force impart, that I may know if Shee or no, intendeth to bee Cruell, your silence can with art expresse, the heart's unfeined story When modest tongues feare to confesse then daring eyes can best devise enchanting Oratory. [Why thinkst thou Foole thy Beauties Rayes ] Why thinkst thou Foole thy Beauties Rayes Why thinkst thou Foole thy Beauties Rayes should flame my colder Heart when thy disdaine shall sev'rall wayes such peircing blasts impart seest not those Beames that guild the day, though they be hot and fierce t'have neither heate Nor power to stay, when windes themselves dispierce, So though thine Eye heates my desire, yet know thy coy disdaine falls like a storme on That young fire, and blowes mee coole againe. [When the cleer Sunn with his beams hot] When the cleer Sunn with his beams hot When the cleer Sunn with his beams hot, Scorched the Grasse in Meade and Mountaine, Strephon the Sheapheard now forgot, late fitting by a Christall fountaine under a spreading Beeches shade, for Phyllis eare this Ditty made; Farewell farewell false and untrue Love, light as the winde Soon chang'd for new love. So long as I was in your sight I Was your life, your heart, your treasure, and with fain'd eyes you moan'd and sigh'd As in flame burning past all measure, three dayes endur'd this love to mee, and It was lost in other three. Farewell farewell &amp;c. Soon as another Swayne you Saw, who may by love or likeing feigned, you 'gan from mee your love withdraw, and soon my place he had obtained. Then came a third your love to Win, and wee were out and he was in. Farewell &amp;c. Doubtlesse you bear your Selfe in hand, because of loves you breed such plenty, to fill with new loves All the Land, and all the World if it were empty, But O you doe your selfe beguile, because they live so short a while, Farewell farewell &amp;c. [What would any man desire] What would any man desire? What would any man desire? is he cold? then here's a fire Is he hot? shee'l gently scoole him 'till he finde that heat does coole him, Is he Sad? then here's a pleasure, is hee poore? then here's a treasure. Loves he Musick? Here's the choice of all sweet sounds in her sweet voyce. Does he hunger, heer's a Feast to which a God might bee a guest, and to those Viands if hee thirst, heer's Nectar for him, since the first of men that was for sinne a deptor, never any Tasted better. Heer's all compleat from head to heele, to heare, to see, tast Smell or feele. [Thou that excellest and sweeter smellest] [1] Thou that excellest and sweeter smellest Then budding Roses yet Cruelly killest, Others sit billing, Loves Nectar spilling, Why shouldst thou then to mee Prove so unwilling, Thy looks so smiling, all hearts beguiling Kindled the fire of my desire. 2 Then be not cruell, my Loves chiefe Jewell, Quench the flames thou hast made, or give them fewell, All those that knew mee, when they shall view mee, With death rewarded, will curse her that slew mee. O let relenting, and swift repenting, From danger free, both thee and mee. 3 Then wee'l lye gasping, Arme in arme clasping, Of Loves Sweets that have past each others asking, Our hearts united, this way delighted, Shall not with needlesse feare, no more be frighted. But with sweet Kisses, multiply blisses, Untill wee prove, one soule in Love. [I sweare by Muskadell] [1] I sweare by Muskadell, That I doe Love thee, well And more then I can Tell, By the white Clarret and Sack, I doe love thy Black black black, 2 So lovely and so fayre Ore shaddow'd with thy hayre, So nimble just like haire, All these set mee on loves rack, For thy sweeter Black black black. 3 No goddesse 'mongst them all, So slender and so tall, And gracefull too withall, Which makes my sinews to Crack, For thy dainty Black black black. 4 Thy kinde and loving Eye, When first I did Espye, Our loves it did descrye, Dumb speaking what d'yee lack, Mine answered thy Black black black. [Fondnesse of man to love a shee] Fondnesse of man to love a shee, Were beauties Image on her Face So carv'd by Immortality, As envious time cannot disgrace. Who shall weigh a Lovers paine, fain'd smiles a while his hopes may steere but soon reduced by sad disdaine to the first principles of feare. Then farewell fayrest ne're will I, Pursue uncertain blisses more: Who sayles by womans constancy, Shipwracks his Love on every shore. [Downe Be still you Seas] Downe Be still you Seas Downe Be still you Seas, water your dread master please, Downe downe I say or be silent as the day, you that fling and roare a loft Whistling winds be still and soft, not an Angry look let fly, you proud Mountains Fall and dye. Tumble no more, nor kick nor Roare, not trouble her Keele to make her reele, but safe from Surges, Rocks and Sand, Kisse her and Stroake her, and set her a Land. [You say you love mee] You say you love mee, nay can sweare it too You say you love mee, nay can sweare it too, but stay Sir, 'Twill not doe, I know you keepe your Oathes, just as you weare your Cloaths, while new and fresh in fashion, but once growne old you lay them by, forgot like words you speake in passion I'le not believe you. [Hence with this wedlock Chaine and Smart] Hence with this wedlock Chaine and Smart Hence with this wedlock Chaine and Smart I'le not have People laugh at me for wearing shackles on my heart, and live engag'd that might live Free, I'le keep my Freedome all I can, and never live a Married man You that have servile mindes may marry and confine your selves to one I will not from my nature vary, which like a thousand yet Love none But keep my freedome all I can, and never live a Married man. [So have I seene a Silver Swann] So have I seene a Silver Swann So have I seene a Silver Swann, as in a watry looking Glasse, viewing her whiter forme and then, Courting her Selfe with lovely grace. As now shee doth her selfe her selfe admire Being at once the fuell and the fire. [View'st thou that poore penurious payre] View'st thou that poore penurious payre View'st thou that poore penurious payre of Lovers how they Bill, Instructed not by wanton faire, but by a Mutuall will. Such needlesse aydes these Wretches scorne, they finde out hid desires, which in each others minde being borne begets them to new fires. [If I must tell you what I love] If I must tell you what I love If I must tell you what I love before my heart shall bow to any 'Tis not the Black that I approve, nor yet the Browne ador'd by many The first is Farr from all delight, 'tis beauties foe and not complexion, The Embleme Of sad care and night, still moveing horror not affection. [When on mine eyes her eyes first shone] When on mine eyes her eyes first shone When on mine eyes her eyes first shone, I all amazed steadily Gazed, and shee to make mee more amazed so caught so wove foure eyes in one as Who had with advizement seen us would have admir'd Loves equall force between us, But treason in those friendlike eyes, my heart first charming and then disdaining, so charm'd it e're it dreamt of Harming, as at her mercy now it Lyes and shewes me to my endlesse smart, shee lov'd but with her eyes I with my heart. [Be not thou so foolish nice] Be not thou so foolish nice Be not thou so foolish nice, as to bee invited twice What should Woemen more incite then their own sweet Appetite, shall Savage things more Freedome have, then Nature unto Woemen gave. The Swan the Turtle, and the Sparrow, Bill a while then take the Marrow; They Bill and Kisse, what Then they doe, Come Bill and Kisse and I'le shew you. [Come I faint thy tedious stay] Come I faint thy tedious stay Come I faint thy tedious stay doubles each hower of the Day, the Nimble hast of winged love, makes aged time not seem to move. Did not the night, and then the light, instruct my sight, I should forget the Sunn, Forget his flight. Shew not the drooping Marigold, whose Leaves like dolefull Armes doe Fold, my longing nothing can explaine, but Soule and Body rent in twaine. Did I not Moane, and sigh and groane, and talke alone, I might believe my Soule from home were gone. [God Lyeus ever young] God Lyeus ever young God Lyeus ever young, ever Honour'd ever sung, stain'd with Blood of lusty Grapes, in a thousand lusty shapes. Daunce upon the Mazers brim, in the crimson Liquor swim, from thy plenteous hand Divine, let a River run with wine, God of mirth let this day heere, enter neither care nor Feare, enter neither care nor feare. [Not Roses coucht within a Lilly bed] Not Roses coucht within a Lilly bed Not Roses coucht within a Lilly bed, are those commixtures That depaint thy Face, nor yet the white, which silvers Hyem's head, Mixt with the dewy Mornings purple grace; But thou whose fayre my Senses captive led, whom I erst Fondly deem'd of heavenly race, hast from my guiltlesse Blood which thou hast Shed, and envies palenesse got thy white and Red. [So many Loves have I neglected] So many Loves have I neglected So many Loves have I neglected, whose good parts might move Mee, that now I am of all rejected, there is none will Love mee. Why is Mayden heat so coy, it Freezeth when it burneth, loosing what it Might enjoy and having lost it mourneth. [Now the Lusty Spring is seen] Now the Lusty Spring is seen Now the Lusty Spring is seen, greene, yellow, gaudy blue, daintily invites the view on ev'ry Bush on ev'ry greene, Roses blushing as they blowe And inviting men to pull, Lillies whiter then the Snow, Woodbines With sweet hony full. All Loves Emblemes, and all cry Ladyes if not Pluckt you dye. [Wherefore peep'st thou envious day] [1] Wherefore peep'st thou envious day, Wee can Kisse without thee, Lovers hate that golden ray, That thou bear'st about thee. Go and give them Light that sorrow, Or the Saylor flying, Our Embraces need no Morrow Nor our pleasures Eying. 2 Wee shall curse thy curious Eye, For our soon betraying, And condemne thee for a spye, If thou see us playing. Get thee gone and Lend thy flashes, Where there's need of lending. Our affections are not ashes. Nor our Kisses ending. 3 Were wee cold or wither'd heere, Wee should wish thee by us, Or but one another feare, Then thou should'st not fly us. Wee are young thou mar'st our pleasure, Goe to Sea and slumber, Darknesse only gives us leasure, Our stolne joyes to number. [Turne Turne, turne thy beautious face away] Turne Turne, turne thy beautious face away Turne Turne, turne thy beautious face away, how pale and sickly looks the Day in emulation of thy brighter Beames. O envious light fly fly begone Come Night and joyne two breasts in one, when what Love does we will repeate in dreames. Yet thine eyes open, who can day hence fright Let but their Lidds fall and it will be night. [When I behold my Mistres face] When I behold my Mistres face When I behold my Mistres face, where beauty hath her dwelling place, And see those seeing starres her eyes, In whom Loves fire for ever lyes. And heare her witty Charming words, her sweet Tongue to mine Eare affords Mee thinks he wants Wit, Eares, and Eyes, whom Love makes not Idolatrize. [My Love and I for Kisses plaid] My Love and I for Kisses plaid My Love and I for Kisses plaid shee would keepe stakes I was content, but when I wonn shee would be paid, this made mee Aske her what shee meant. Nay since I see quoth shee I see quoth Shee your wrangling vaine, take your own Kisses and I'le take mine againe. [In a vale with flowrets spangled.] In a vale with flowrets spangled. Strephon meeting her thus plained To the Nymph that had intangled, And to her his Bosome Chained, Tarry O tarry faire at the sigh's at the prayre of who thy deare eyes admires Hark how each thing wee see doe all discourse of shee, so thy Beauty all Inspires. The Birds thy praises sing smooth windes the blessing acknowledge to thy breath Of their sweet breathing. Th'earth sayes thou art their spring, each flower confessing their sent and Colour was Of thy bequeathing.

Stay cruell stay he cryes, And let thy Eares and Eyes, Of thy faults the Records bee. And those that prais'd thee late, See how thy Scornes they hate. In their due remorce of mee.
