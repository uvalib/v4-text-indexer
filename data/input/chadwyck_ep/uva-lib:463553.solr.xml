      <field name="fulltext">To my worthily-accomplished and most endeared Cosin, SIR Richard Hutton Knight. Sir, here receive these Obit-teares of Ours, While Native Love and Duty nourish Yours: Let us then joyne our Funerall Odes in One, “His dearest God-sonne with his Eldest Sonne. Though Heires in such like Teares doe seldom share, I'm sure true Tears streame from your Fathers Heire. Excuse me, Sir, that these come forth so late, “They come too soone by Voice and Vote oth' State. To my truly-esteemed and highly-respected Cosin, Thomas Hutton Esquire; A Member of the Honourable Society of Grais-Inne. To you, though younger, yet the same in blood, Send I this patterne of parentall good: Whose imitation shall you more advance Then Fortunes portion, or Inheritance. For those to Moales of worthlesse mindes are given, Where these Lines chalke you out your way to heaven: Whose lineall-lustre if you doe not smother, Makes you Corrivall with your Elder Brother; Whom as I live I love; and in him you: “This shall my Muse in richest raptures shew. While Memory o're your dead Father reares A Shrine bedewed with Astræas Teares. Astræa's Teares. TO THE PIOUS MEMORY Obiit. Feb. 26. Anno Domini 1638. of Sir Richard Hutton Knight; And lately, One of his Majesties Justices of his Highnesse Court of Common Plees at Westminster. An Elegie. Great Æsculapius, hadst thou none to kill But Britaines grave Hortensius with a pill? Hippocrates his Maxim never ment On Goodmens lives to make experiment But on indulgent patients, who did breath Lesse spirit in their life then in their death: For their inglorious Ev'nings could forbid Others to doe ought lesse then what they did. Tell me, O tell me! who could with his eye Survey a gracefull-usefull Nurcerie, Stored with various plants that might befit Their Masters turne for Shade or Benefit, And in this Seminarie to cut downe An humble-mounting Tamrick, though full-growne Whose very Site might prove him to be made A Grace for some, to other plants a Shade? Injurious Fate! if I may justly call That Fate unjust, which is impartiall; Why wouldst thou not in this vast wildernesse (Where every worldling seemes to interesse His sole imployments, as no place but here Were th' Native soile whereto he must adhere) Cull out such rotten and worme-eaten trees Who keep a place, but promise no increase? Some might thy subtile eye have quickly found Crook'd, or with swelling bunches to abound; Others so strangely wreath'd, 'twere hard to know By their loose-dangling tops what way they grow. Others so freely spreading, as their root Takes so much ground, it holds all others out. Others Time-statists, scorning to incline To any compleat humour but of Time. Others like Sprigges from th' Phœnix ashes bred, Fix on that Sun by whom they'r nourished; From which should thousand motes like atomes rise, They'd vow them beames darted from Phœbus eyes. And coulds't chuse none of these to make a dish For hungry wormes, and close a Subjects wish? These doe no good, they trouble but the earth By making goodnesse labour of a dearth. But say, Grand-Artizan of pick and spade, If thou in purple hast desire to trade, Traverse thy ground, thou canst not safely erre, But finde Intelligencers ev'ry where. Here maist thou finde a Cœlius, one of might, Who pleads worse with his left hand then his right: A Critick Consull, who Records can tax, And make the Law a very nose of wax. Neat-glorious Glosses can his Art finde out Either to raise or reconcile a doubt: And with such confidence, as if this man Were held the Ages sole Iustinian: Yet of his reasons he no ground can gather, Unlesse he lye them on an unknown father. Hows'ere, his weake Assertions are held good, And long-approv'd e're they be understood. But th' Reason why he beares such high command Is this, “Hee's great for whom he seemes to stand. There a loose-liv'd-licentious Appius Who woo's his mistresse with a rev'rend busse: A purple-prostitute, that hides this mote With gravity and colour of his coat. Yet who should see this uselesse Trunk, would sweare His age had made him fitter for a Beare Then amorous embraces; and this grave Grave-sinking Patriot must his Doxie have, Who in her active postures is so pliant, She feeds on him, as he did on his Client. There a sweet-sented Flavius, who could speake More Tully in steletting of his peak: Or twirling his Mouchato's, then those low Declining drossie Groundlings e're could doe. Flowers of selected phrases spring by nature, While matter must serve words, not words the matter: No aire sounds unaffected, which imparts More musick to our eares then to our hearts. Yet though his tongue be smooth, his body small, Within he stores huge Magazins of gall, Which raise in him such indigested passion, As if styles of disgrace were all in fashion. Were not this Bird, in earnest tell me Fate, Farre fitter for thy Cage then for our State? Surely, I think, it would availe thee much (His moving tongue and eloquence is such) To have him for thine Orator, to draw Poore Mortals to submit them to thy law: And though he hold himselfe for Death unfit, He might move others to encounter it. There a word-scattering Pytheas, who affords A drop of reason for a sea of words. Of numerous discourse, and so well fraught As he speakes more then ever he was taught: And in those conscript Magisteriall Seats A Chaos too of Cases he repeats, How properly I meane not to debate, Hows'ere it argues a retentive pate. Thus Aristippus findes stones set on stones Senselesse of widowes teares, or orphanes moanes. THESE eye the Clock, and measure out the day In numbring houres, not hearing what men say. What rich, enamel'd Shadowes (Fate) are these, Who fat themselves to foster a disease? These suck full fortunes from a Gooses quill, By setting of their Names unto a Bill Which (as they seldome doe) if they read o're, They are no wiser then they were before. But a Cramm'd purse can never knowledge want, 'Tis want of meanes displaies the ignorant. There a corrupt Sysambris, who would win A pretious Bribe with losing of his skin. There a Turinus, who in ev'ry nook Deludes poore people with the sale of smook. These Chymicall Impostors from grosse mold Extract th' Elixir of refined gold And never surfet, till their mouthes be fill'd With that rich gravell their injustice pill'd. For as the Horseleach crieth still, more, more, So they desire new measure to their store, Which like Erichthous bowels, swell so fast, As they consume their owners lungs at last. Now tell me Fate, wer't thou enjoyn'd to steale This pretious treasure from our Common-weale, And spare impurer mettals soild with rust, Who lay a shame upon their Countrey's trust? There was a time, but no such place as kere, When to Anticyræ such shipped were As honour'd goodnesse: No inhabitants Admitted were but timing Sycophants, Lascivious Palliards, who made publick sale Of vestall-virgin-honours by retaile. Dark shops were in request to vend base ware, Each in an act of knavery claim'd his share. Whole Sholes of bankrupt Marchants week by week Broke, and those held the wisest that did breake For most, and when it lay within their power Could subtilely delude their Creditour. Petitionarie Pattenties grew strong, Pretending by prescription to doe wrong: State-prolling Sherkes, who to supply their turne Laugh'd in their sleeves to see their Country mourne Nought smel'd of profit, though it took beginning From that contagious-leprous source of sinning, But't relished: yet how did these bestow This large distreaming fortunes over-flow But on Vitellian bankets, luscious fare, Phantastick habits? while their Ladies care Extended to a Play hill, a Caroach, A compleat Usher, or Postillion Coach; A Bevy of out-landish Tirewomen, For nought could suit their humors that was c?mon. No Artist, were he never held so rare, Tasting no other but his countrey aire Could gaine request: those onely bore renowne Who were least knowne to fashions of their owne. Those then were honest men, who in good troth Could mince an oath, and cheat, and wipe their mouth, Guild vertue with pretences, and deceave Deluded eyes with onely seeming grave. No reall goodnesse purchas'd them esteeme, Those were held good, that did but goodly seeme; Yea, seeming-good lost her account in time, And by degrees fell into that decline As those who gave a countenance to good Were held degenerating from their blood: So as to lye a blemish on His fame Whose actions were a glory to his name; Or to detract from good men, or disgrace A Magistrate or Iustice in his place Was held an act of honour;—Th' Counterfeat Taxing a Iustice on his Iustice Seat Was an high-Mufty made; none durst reprove His frontlesse impudence, but highly love His resolution, though his phrentick Spirit Meerly consisted in debasing merit: Nor needed this indulgence, though he err'd, In good mens thoughts, he ever was preferr'd. Those onely Martiall Chevalieres were held Could veile a plume of feathers in the field; Speake bigge to their inferiours, and define (What they had got off booke) their discipline. Then ranke their squadrons in each regiment, Though they knew little what their Captain meant, Nor he himselfe, while he by mimick charmes Could gull the State, and guild his harmlesse Armes. BUT our's a golden age, a glorious State, Where no such Scarabees surround our gate; Our Purple-conscript-fathers are divine And scorne to cloze with th' humour of the time. They shun preferment as our Clergie doe, And would decline it, were it offer'd too. Their Iudgements and Decretals do proceed From a discreet, sage and judicious head: For what imports the publicke interest That they deliver with a constant breast. Our Courtiers too, they have no trickes to please, To purchase suits, desertlesse offices. Free are they from all avaritious thirst, What they preferre it must be honest first, For else to gaine an Empire they'l not doe it, Nor shew least gracefull countenance unto it. These seriously examine ev'ry point In such a suit, before they'l stirre a joint, As thus: “Is't honest? may it not offend “The State? inferrs't not some peculiar end? “May't introduce no president of ill? “Nor with suspicious feares the people fill? “Doe'st undermine no Trade? No Commerce stay? “Nor turne our Traffick cleare another way? “Doth it not trench upon some Company? “Nor wrong the State by some Monopoly? “May I present't with honour, and come off “Like a wise Courtier without a scoffe? “May I ingratiate him do'es imploy me, “That no calumnious Agent may annoy me? “May I with reputation so proceed “As no just rub t'ancipate my speed. “Is the foundation firme whereon I stand? “Does't promise good successe if rightly man'd? “Should it be granted, as't importeth one “Would it doe good to many, hurt to none? This our good Courtiers weigh, as may appeare By many Suits presented lately here: Wherein sole love to goodnesse was their aime, Which they preferr'd before their Pattents gaine. Our Ladies too are modest in attire, They see no forraigne dressings they desire; No cerussed complexion they endure, To feed vain fancie with as light a lure; They keep their windowes shut; no bosome bare, It must be private if they take the aire. They sacrifice not th' Morning of the day Unto their Glasse, nor th' Ev'ning to a Play; Our Court-rere bankets seldome they frequent, But make their Feasts a pœnitentiall Lent. They care not for priority of place; Nor wooe affection with a borrowed face. They love not to consort, nor to be knowne To any Favorites but to their owne. Snayles may be well their Embleames, for they live Still within doores, lest they should Patterns give Of wandring unto others; They are chary Whom to admit, but whom they meane to marry. Their Usher, though he be a proper man, Ha's but accesse unto them now and than, And then he stands at distance, lest he tempt, Or his familiarity breed contempt. They aske not what this dressing cost, nor flower, Fruitlesse expences they reserve for th' poore, And with as free extensive hand they give it While every farthing sweetned is with Civit. If a light-amorous line approch their hand, Like a poor-wounded Deare at Bay they stand, Astonisht at the folly of such men, Who ravell Time out with so light a pen. Yet they'l peruse the Letter ore and ore And finde, perchance, more then they found before, Not to admire him nor affect his straine But to disgrace him when they meet againe; Yet with such sweetnesse, he shall hardly know Whether in earnest they be mov'd or no. Such modest-Matron-Mirrors, Ladies be; They coynesse love, though Love's their liverye. Our Camp-Commanders too, they merit praise, Who had they liv'd in Agamemnons dayes, Those fierce Atrides, or in Armes had come When Carthage was beleagred by Rome, Brave Hannibal, Hamilchar, Asdrubal Had rais'd their Citie to a Capitall. So active is the Gentry of our time, So docile too in feats of discipline, Which such impressions in their service take, As one weekes training may an Ancient make. Tara tantara, what a martiall sight Of brave Commanders disciplin'd for fight Approch th' insulting foe! no stratagem Practis'd abroad but introduc'd to them; No feat, defeat, advantage, point of warre, But to our Colonels familiar. No Tearmes of Armes but these exactly know, Their Marches, Postures, and Gradations too, Their Sconces, Palisado's, Parapets, Their Military-Ovall Coronets; Sallies, Alarmes, Excursions, Rendevous, Issues, Retraits, their Pay unto a souse. Their Martiall Ord'nance too they can dispose And to the disadvantage of their foes Plant them with such discretion, none would deeme But that they knew the Frier invented them. Their Musket, Saker, Minion, Culverin, Dragonet, Basiliske, and Carabin: These with their sev'rall Charges they'l explaine By their dexterity unto a graine. These passe that Captain, who desir'd to heare What discipline was us'd in ev'ry shere, Or what new Ordinance they had in store This Ile was not acquainted with before: By a briske merry Greeke, whose jeering nature Could tell a Tale, and never laugh at th' matter Noting his ignorance, was answer'd thus: “Sir, there be Pieces lately come to us “Of strange proportion and as strange a style, “The like whereof ne're landed in this Ile. “And if my mem'ry faile not, they are these, “State-frighting Formidons, Quo mixuses, “Neat Cerciorares, Stockes that ne're will burst, “By Fabius Maximus invented first, “When by delay and spinning out of time “He finished his glorious designe. “And these, beleev't, Sir, are of such esteeme, “As Harquebusses are but Squirts to them “For usefull mannagement: for I have seene These Coun?treys? might have b?een? in Vto?pia? for ou?ght? he knew. “In Zealand, Brabant, where I oft have beene These Countryes might have been in Vtopia for ought he knew. “And kept my fixt Perdue, these Armes doe more “One houre, then others would in twenty foure. The credulous Captaine, he beleeves the man, Desiring much to know from whenc they came, And by what Engines drawne on horse or foot, But this Atturney fearing to be out By entring more discourse, briefly declar'd How they were moulded, planted and prepar'd, But at such distance, as whats'ere he s'ed Was by the Captaine firmly credited For reall Oracles, as't might appeare The more he heard, the more he sought to heare: So as in th' end this expert Blademan vow'd He had spoke nought that could be dis-allow'd: For having never heard Law-terme before A Formedon might be a Musket-bore For ought he knew; nor did he hold it fit That th' Enemy should notice have of it, But that such Engines as he had related Should by command be on our selves estated Without discovery to such forraine Powers As wished no successe to us nor ours. But their occasions so divide their journey As th' Captaine must take leave of his Atturney, Returning him great thankes for his relation And wishing many such within our Nation, Whose knowne experience might secure the State, And make the Age ingaged to his pate. Though th' Law-man knew not what these Engines ment Nor ever any other Instrument Save what his A vaste Magazin of Bilis, with other Law-Engines. Law-port mantua did containe, The late reversions of a factious braine, Whose native vigour being broke asunder Would startle weake Defendents worse then thunder. Yet one Occurrent I must here relate Which in their Progresse happened of late; This Chivaliere had a desire to play A game at Bowles his journey to allay, Or else directed by another aime (More probable of two) in hope to gaine. A Cumrade takes him up; but th' Captaine would Have none but this Atturney keep the gold, That strange Relater, for he held him just, And therefore none he might more safely trust: What he enjoynes, he as demurely takes, But in conclusion runs away with stakes. But riding on no swift Pegasean Steed Clozing with those Stanza's of famous Bragamoni “What though the Jade his Masters fury feels “Hee yeelds the spoile because hee wanted heeles. He renders stakes because he wanted speed. But let no trifling Tales take up that place Which on my Poem should bestow most grace. Our Clergie too; men of a choice repast, (For I reserve my best wine for the last) How they scorne avarice; loath venerie, And sing an Antheme with Conformitie? Survey their dainty Ducks from top to toe, Their active wastlesse wasts above, below, You shall see beauty in her proper place, Without Embrodery, Fringe, or Tinsell lace: And to restraine wild fancie, their intent Crownes pure resolves with a religious Being most austere observers of that ancient Decretall touching Abstinence and Continence in Lent. Lent. Their fixt desires are cloz'd; they doe not crave From their Parochialls more then they have. Their late Petition was not ment a pressure T'inrich themselves, but to improve th' Successour; For what they did was out of Conscience While their desires cloz'd in a competence. They hate Non-residence with all such vermin As feed their Audience with a pocket-Sermon. Their Study makes them leane: they scorne to rise To honour or a deoble benefice. Zeale is that sacred Lampe they study by, Which they display in turning white oth' eye. Our zealous Zimri's too, their Trophies raise Adorned with Rose-mary and gilt Baies, Wherewith they meet their late-exiled Pastor, Servant and Master who may run the faster. Their precious fervour can present their grieves, Thousands combining to pull downe Lawne sleeves. So strong's th' infusion of our Bandites zeale, They'd form the Church to Plato's Common-weale: Presbytrian parity sole undertaker To raze a Doctor, and to raise a Baker. Yet in this pure Platonick Common-weale We have some Darnell mixed in our meale. All are not Solons that do Purple weare, Nor all true Courtiers that do so appeare; Nor all our Ladies really devout, Nor all our braving Cavaliero's stout; Nor all our seeming Levites well content, Nor all their zealous females continent. The Sunne h'as motes, what may we think of these Who ta'ne with fancie, honour or with fees Expose their fames to an injurious staine Which blemish'd once, are ne're made white againe? What of these formall Agents who pretend Good to the State, but worke their private end? These moderne Machavels who can devise A vertuous vizard for an odious vice? These who can lye their hand upon their heart, And gull their loyallst friends with words of Art? Such fruitlesse shrubbs in my opinion were Fitter to cope with Fate then such as are Mirrors of Justice, who bestow their Oile To fructifie a leane and barren soile With honest culture, or such Scienes croppe Who shadow freer Spurges with their toppe. And such an One was that grave Patriot Whose pious zeale such reputation got Amongst good-men, who onely hold such great As make iust actions steps unto their Seat. These close not with Times garbe, nor can they vaile To that Soild-foot-cloth sets his soule to sale. And yet there are Some such make Justice go On Crutches, while poore vertue rank'd below Must hold his Stirrup; of which vicious sort Sport for Democritus.Yeering Democritus could make a sport; Accoast them with derision, and discover The loose embraces of a wanton Lover, To make them more contemptuous to themselves, And caution simple Clients of such Shelves As most endanger Justice: “If you'l live, “And prosper in your Suits, be sure you give “Meat to the mouth oth' Court; you'r rightly serv'd “In suff'ring a good cause for to be starv'd “For want of exhibition: let him ply “The Iron while 'tis hot, and in a pye “Incoffin such a bounty, as't may force “The Iudge to crowne his Cause though it be worse “Then his penurious Adversary, who “Was foil'd because hee'd nothing to bestow. “Suits are like Pills, they must be guilded over, “For should they any bitternesse discover, “The squeamish appetite would not receive them, “But either loath them or directly leave them. “Some have I seene advanced to a place “For their smooth polite tongue, or amorous face. “Others by making betts, as I've beene told, “While others lost their Place, for being Old. “This rais'd for making Courts an Ostridge nest, “That raz'd for bringing Courts into request: “Playing his Cards so to his publick shame, “For all his huge Ruffe, He must lose the Game. “One in a Funerall pompe goes to his Grave, “One in triumphant port jetts to receive “His Consul-charge; yet e're the next Moonth come “A Writ of Ease may kick him from his roome. “For as 'tis fit, whens'ere th' Dictator please, “He must surrender by a Writ of Ease. “Laugh, laugh Democritus, for thou art free “From these State fears Who is he mindeth thee?

Nor is this all; when Portia besought That those spoke ill of Cato should be brought Before th' Prætorian, to confesse their crime And cleare his fame by paying of a fine; Romes Conscript Fathers held her motion fit, With gen'rall voyce and vote confirming it. To Tullianum were they straight convaid, There to remaine till they their fines had paid. This Act knew no demurre; downe went their gold, Which to supply, their Houshold-stuffe was sould, Their Farmes ingag'd, their persons at command, Till they discharg'd these Debets out a-hand, To th' Publique Treasory what first belong'd, To th' Widdow next whose husband they had wrong'd. The Flamen, though their Augur, being tride, Pai'd twice so much as all the rest beside. Their doome was just; I wish like censure may be, “To cloze the Morall with his wronged Ladie. Thus this Sage Patriot by heav'ns command, Who liv'd to be the Antienst Iudge oth' Land, Translated hence from this inferiour Vaile But th'Silver cord is broke, the grinders faile, And he translated from this fable vaile Mounts to that high Prætorian, where true blisse Becomes his Baile, his Judge his Saviour is. Mounts up to glory with a prosperous saile Ripe both in yeares and graces: and to prove That he did never Ostentation love, He gives direction that no Sermon be To cloze the Sceane of his mortalitie, Lest He forth of exuberance of wit Should speake more to his praise then he held fit. Nor might his Corpse be coach'd, as others use, From th' City to his Countrey-Mannor house, But at Sainct Dunstons neare to Scrieants In He takes his Grave, where Death surprized him. So small a Plotte containes so great a Pile Whose life gave light and honour to our Ile: What's left of that faire Structure is a gage Of mans decline and winter of his age.

A numerous Book-man, who from severall places Could store his pleadings with a thousand Cases, Which prov'd his Studies were estrang'd from Sloath, His Leafes not Spider-wov'n, nor known to Moath; As I've seene some, who shelv'd large volumes by th?, But knew not what was in them, should you try them.

The fabrick of this Building now's pull'd downe, The higher parted from the lower roome; The Cover of this structure turn'd to dust, The Center made a Parlour for the just. Dull stones are rubbish uselesse for example, This fit for th' polish'd corners of the Temple: The price then of this Gem who value can, But He who now enjoyes it, God and man? Upon his death. To some on Earth a quicker death is given, No course can be too speedy unto heav'n; In him lies here, this may be verefide, Who dide to Earth, before on Earth he dide. He heard his Saviours invitation, Come; And he no sooner heard him then he run. “This made him sleight his life, to show his love, “Having his feet below, his faith above. PANARETEES TRIVMPH: OR, HYMENS heavenly Hymne. Pæana cantat Hymen; taceat lachrymabile Carmen. The sixt yeares ANNIVERS. Remove that funerall-pile; now six whole yeares Have beene the Nursing mothers of my teares. These rivell'd furrowes of mine aged cheeke Have writ griefes characters exceeding deepe. But what's perpetuall cannot mix with earth, “Joyes must partake with teares, and teares with mirth. Those carelesse foldings of mine armes must cease While ayres resounded cares, and cares ay-mees; While tones were threnes, ech motion of my tongue The dying accent of a Swan-like song. These must be closed in her sacred shrine Whose living beautie, while enstyled mine, Made me too earthly-blest;—Another rite Must banish these presentments from my sight; Yet in their exile shall I still retaine That Anniversall mem'ry of her Name, As those declining-earth-resolving flowers Where wee'r to celebrate these Rites of ours Shall to my thoughts a Funerall Lecture read, And in a fresh Brides beauty eye her dead With such an active sorrow, as her Tombe Were th' marriage-bed whereto I sought to come. Yet must this time with Funerall teares dispence, And with a feagned Solace ravish Sense, As if it went to entertaine a Guest Which h'as bene long estranged from my brest. So have I seene the Sunne his beauty shroud, And suddenly breake from a sable cloud With an imperiall splendor, but that beame Became the true forerunner of a Streame. So have I seene Plants in a forward Spring With bloomes and blossomes lively flourishing, Yet long before th' imbroder'd Spring were done Those Plants were seer'd, and all their blossoms gone. So have I seene a glorious Starre appeare, As if sole Empresse of that Hemispheare, Darting her twinkling lights, and marching round Contract her Orbe, and fall upon the ground. So have I seene a manly spirit fight With death so long as Oyle afforded light, Nay smile upon his visitants, and say, “I hope e're long, my friends, to have the day; Yet see vaine hopes! before next enter-breath He proves these were but lightnings 'fore his death. So I; so my moist eye! which though it seeme To take the world with a pleasing beame, And her dis-sorting passions to exile With the reflexion of a forced smile, I'm same I was, and must be ever so, “Woe may put off her weed, no weed her woe. And yet me thinks 'twere ominous to shed A Funerall teare before a Nuptiall bed; This might perplex a Bride, and make her wish Shee'd never tasted of that painted blisse So much by Maids affected, but had still Bene Mistresse of her selfe and her owne will. Those Vialls then my teare-swolne conduits fill'd Shall to a pure Elixar be distill'd, Which well preserv'd may treasur'd fountaines keepe For those who make a face but cannot weepe. First those brave spritely Blades, who puff'd with pride Would in their fathers sadles gladly ride; Hope of concealed treasures, rich demaines Have soakt the thirsty channels of their braines They cannot weepe to die for't: yet they'r knowne By ribband, Cypers, mourning-hood and gowne: Which Ornaments of griefe, hows'ere these beare them, Seem better Mourners farre then those that wear them. Nor is there hope that these will e're have sense To grieve, till what their Fathers providence Which many restlesse nights had scrap't together Their riot h'as sent packing God knowes whither. Then, ne're till then, they finde what 'twas to have A pleasing eye upon a Fathers grave. To these my late-distreaming eyes shall lend A legacy of teares, and so befriend These state-presenting Mourners, none shall gather But that they sorrow truly for their father Without enforced passion; though short time Shall prove those teares were none of theirs but mine. There be some widdowes too, who stand in need Of our Conserves of teares to suit their weed, That seeming weed of Sorrow: these belye Their sable habits with a teare-forc'd eye: And like those brave Ægyptian modest Dames Whose chaste-bequeathed brests such love inflames, As when their breathlesse husbands buried be They strive which may have the precedencie To be interred with them: So doe these With unamated courage strongly prease Towards their Husbands graves: where they appeare All Niobees; clasping the fatall Beare With an affected zeale; and to ingrave More Sceanes of sorrow leape into his Grave As if they'd be enshrin'd (though nought lesse ment) In the cold bosome of that Monument. Yet h'as not one poor worme undone a stitch Of his fresh-funerall Shroud; no, not that pitch Which seer'd his Coffin flaw'd; no, nor one flower Which beautifide his Hearse decay'd in power; No, nor that late provision which should Refresh his formall Mourners, scarcely cold Till her decreasing griefes suggest unto her An other hopefull, youthfull, active wooer To raise her a new progeny; which done She holds joyes past compar'd with joyes to come Fall short in estimate: She wonders much How any womans passion should be such As to imbrace an Husband that is dead, When th' world's so well supplide, it can bestead Her Choice of such a choice selected one 'Twere madnesse to lament for him that's gone. To these my teares I zealously bequeath, To shed some seeming streamlings at the death Of their expired Husbands; that their sorrow May shew it selfe essentiall, though it borrow Juice from my eyes, which when Time shall restraine I looke my teares shall be restor'd againe. The profuse Gallant too, who lately sped Of a full fortunes with a loathed bed Must share in my teare-tribute to weepe o're her, And wish (vaine wish) that he had dyde before her. Meane time, on choicer stuffe his love he sets, Stepping into a bed of Violets In stead of's icy Consort, who is gone To take possession of her longest home. Yet must he feagne a teare, and force a sigh, And wish his dissolution to be nigh To gull his weake Spectators with a seeming Of being what was least of all his meaning. To fit his sorrow then with fresh supply, He may derive from my distilling eye A numorous store; yet would I have him come When he h'as done (as hee'l have quickly done) To render me, and that without delay, What I have lent, and he is bound to pay. Nor would I have him make the world believe While he so passionately seemes to grieve, That these distreaming rivolets arise From any other fountaine then mine eyes. Now some will aske why my decaying time Should to such solemne nuptiall rites incline? Whereto I answer, no licentious fire Inflam'd my sprinkling Organs with desire, No glowing heat of fancy did I feele, Unto my ? I freely may appeale. These were unfitting motives to weake Sense, Though Age must render age benevolence When time, place, spirit may such acts admit With equall willing minds to second it. No, my affection never tooke delight Ith' light embraces of a marriage night, Nor to make sacred rites such tempting lures To sate th' desire without more inward cures. For had these bene mine ends, my constant ayme Had long since fixt upon more youthfull game. Nor did I want in number to supply The curious choice of loves-attractive eye, Which may appeare by those selecter lines My widdow Muse compos'd in former times. True, sayes her Cash-keeper, but in the third place.“Four wenches be there who my love would win, “And stick as close as Ticks unto my skin; “The first a widdow worth True, sayes her Cash-keeper, but in the third place. six thousand pound, “But my Hopes say, more thousands may be found; “The next as nimble as the mountaine Ree, “But all her fortunes are not worth a stroe; “The third a wanton witty worldly Cricket, “But too too many Cubbs have sprung her wicket; “The fourth of lovely hue and lively quicknesse, “For th' Trickle-bed h'as cured her green-sicknesse, “A Damsell fresh as is the flower in May, “But her pure zeale impurer acts display: “Advise me which to chuse, and I'le have at her, “One must I have, more is an hanging matter. And these were true, as I may hope for life, Yet could no beauty stamp the style of wife In my affection: for I found no Spouse Could cheere my fancy like mine inner house: Which to adorne with vessels of choice grace, I made my Grove my sole-retiring place. Where in a sacred melancholy I Red in each Creature such variety As I perceiv'd the very lowest plant Might read a lecture to the ignorant To make him rightly learn'd: No Bird ith' Aire But sung her morning thankfull chantelere. Which made me blush to hear such hymns from these, And I, ungratefull I, to hold my peace. This 'twas that made me seriously to marke The various warblings of the early Larke, With what a winged speed she made resort To joyne in consort with the heav'nly Court. The Silke-worme I observ'd too, how she sought Forth of those threeds she from her bowels wrought To deck delicious man; how wondrously Her silk-web spun, she turn'd a Butterfly. Againe, I turn'd me to a desert cave Matted with mosse like to an antient Grave, Wherein I found a subject of that sense As it exceeded humane providence; A brisled Hedge-hogge, who retaines a forme Of storing in a calme against a storme. These were the Books I red: for teares had so Surpriz'd my dim eyes with an overflow, As to bestow my sight, I held it better Upon a living then a dying letter. Now you will wonder how I should depart From this condition which had seaz'd my hart, And take me to the world which I'd forgone Since the deprivall of my dearest One. 'Tis true, you well may wonder, yet I finde Some maine inducements to divert the minde From such amazement; heare me, I'l be briefe, And amongst many reasons call the chiefe. I had some little Children for whose care A native love injoyn'd me to prepare; Tender they were in yares as in my love, But, 'las, hows'ere their Non-age might approve My constant zeale, so weak was my intent, I could not perfect what my purpose ment. A Father though he lov's posterity Cannot play Mother in a family, Nor dandle a young infant, nor bestow Such easie kisses as a Nurse can doe. No; nor ith' Needle, nor in any Art Expresse himselfe so formally expert As a remisser temper can apply, Besides some offices necessity Injoyne them to performe: Nor is this all, No Solemnizer of a Funerall But having cloz'd the period of his sorrow, His late-expired teares may solace borrow Of some calme interbreaths, and learne to smile, Though it be farre from th' heart, and so beguile A pensive houre:—Oh but a widdows state Preserv'd from blemish do'es participate A gracious freedom! and you know we read “Honour a widdow that is so indeed. Yet Eve when she was made of Adams bone, God held't not meet that man should be alone, And therefore rais'd him Helpe, that joyn'd together One heart might tender mutuall joy to either. In this my griefe-surprized heart was needing, To cheere my selfe and for my childrens breeding: Whose choice improvement was my highest ayme Next th' honour of his Name from whom I came. Breeding, will some object, who can expect From a Step-dame whose fancie's disrespect, Best favours frownes, content meere discontent, And when most mov'd, most in her Element? 'Tis true there are some such, whose onely song Is canting fury with a glibbry tongue, Bearding their easie husbands, and appeare Rampants till they the good mans bretches weare: Which purchase got, with an imperious brow They glory in the title of a shrow, And lest their Husbands should their Lectures misse, “No messe serv'd up without a Chafindish. And these indeed we Step-dames well may call, But shee's none such that I have matcht withall. For those who are her husbands children knowne, She values them more then they were her owne. Nor is't a curious dresse or luscious fare That work effects upon her matron care; What we account to be the precioust gem That can adorne a civile Citizen Makes her complete; it is a modest eye, That wooes with no straid lookes the passer by; Her Senses are all inward, which divine She h'as no thought, save heaven, she styles not mine. She dis-esteemes hand-basket Citizins Who make their wicker baskets shroud their sins. Pure-elevated eyes who make a show Of doing that they never ment to doe Are Bug-beares to her zeale; which loves to feed Th' oyle of devotion as it is in deed. The Church gives her a Lesson; and her scorne Is to be taught in any other forme. For though, where those grand Covenanters be, She took the place of her Nativitie, Their odious projects she does so despise As with her Needle shee'd pick out their eyes For want of stronger Armour, to expresse That loyall love which she did still professe To Prince and Countrey: this 'twas made me bring That Scottish posie to our Nuptiall ring: “Thus Twede and Tyne our loyall loves combine, “Which Twedish factions never shall untwine. O what a virile Spirit have I seene My Panthea show! what noble dis-esteeme To her zeale-madded Natives, when she heard How they were palisado'd, how prepar'd, How desperately gag'd to such a vow As split their faith, and wrought their ruine too! “What will these ne're have done, thus would she say, “Must Subjects soveraignize, and Kings obey? Calliopees expostulation with the Calidonian Nation. “Must a blind Zeale meerly compos'd of smoake “Delude a Kingdome with an holy cloake? “Must those fall short of their allegeance “Whom Princes grace and favour did advance? “Must we with civile Armes uncivilely “Shed blood, and styl't an Act of piety! “Are all turn'd High-landers? must this debate “Extend unto an universall State? “H'as my deare Countrey flourished till now “With her light zeale to work her overthrow? “For love sake leave, leave these intestine warres, “Succeeding times will sorrow for their scarres. “They cannot chuse but such impressions make, “As th' motion of them may the Fabrick shake. “If good Plants grow among you, cheere them still, “But thrive they cannot till you prune the ill. “Those generous Graffs then labour so to nourish, “That in despite of wild ones they may flourish. “Let not th' ambition of a phrenticks head “Suffer one drop of loyall blood be shed; “It is too precious, if you rightly knew “With what a sacred cement, holy glue “You'r mutually combin'd: oh should you see “Those first prints of your Princes infancie, “You cannot chuse but tax your insolence “To be his foe who tooke his birth from thence! “Admire his Princely clemency, whose will “Had a desire to spare where he might spill. “Long h'as his white flagge freely bene displaid, “O let not your submission be delaid, “Lest you to ill convert apparent good, “And make a white flagge turne a flagge of blood! “What though the thanklesse Ioy should entwine “The spreading spurges of the weeping Vine, “And stick so close unto her seered stem “Till she h'as suckt the juice that nourish'd them, “Must she your Embleme be? oh doe not so, “These Acts worke mainly for your overthrow. “You'r Natives and his Subjects, which should draw “From you a zealous love and loyall aw. “Let it be neuer said that th' Commonweale “Of Scotland perish'd by pretensive Zeale; “It will be such a blemish, such a scorne, “It may impeach the Babe that's yet unborne “When he shall heare (though guiltlesse he of that) “Himselfe unhappy call'd a Traitors brat. “If for your selves then you will not prove true, “Yet for those Branches may descend from you, “Retaine your vow'd allegeance, and returne “Before you see one peering Beacon burne. “Which to the sad Spectator being once showne “I feare me much will not be quench'd so soone: “Lay downe your Armes in time then; 'tis too late “When you heare Fury knocking at your gate; “While Foes and Famine close you so about “As Feare gets in, but nothing can get out. “Trust me, your case presageth nought but losse, “And that which you most hate, your fate, a Crosse; “Disloyall aymes must have disgracefull ends, “Nor can the hope of Favorites or Friends “Divert that Fate: for what heavens hand h'as writ “Is not in power of man to cancell it. “Much have I seene, yet seldom seene I have “Ambition goe gray-headed to her grave: “That your gray haires may then with honour goe “Unto that Earth we all are borne unto, “Renounce that brain-sick oath you there have made; “That Oath's unjust by which your Faith's betraid. “This your owne Native wisheth; crown her wish, “Her vowes shall pay their tribute for your blisse. Nor doth it lesse her disposition please T'enjoy a private then a publick peace; Her House-hold sounds conformity: no jarres Breath civile factions or intestine warres In her calme Family: where some obey, Others command without imperious sway. None glory in precedency, nor stand In opposition of a just command. Againe, if ought appeare irregular, She shewes herselfe no rigid Censurer: Her courteous Curtaine Lectures they are such They leave impressions with so sweet a tutch In apprehensive fancies, clozing so They make men good whether they will or no. She yeelds preeminence unto her Mate, And in this sort seemes to expostulate. “Let't not offend you, Sir, if I impart “The weake expressions of a loyall heart. “The world shall see that I'le performe my vow, “Where you are Caius I am Caia too. “As we are then united, heare me speake, “Whose aymes nought more then your improvement seeke: “Fix on your ripe experience which came “Not onely from th' Survey of Bookes but Man. “Unseason'd houres should challenge no such share “In one who weares Times Embleme in his haire. “That English Proverb in disgrace was made, “That a gray head should have the greenest blade. “Your actions should be postures to the rest “Who are but man-like monsters at the best, “While they decline from what is reall good, “And staine the tincture of a vertuous blood “With ayry vapours, which no sooner see “The glorious Sunne then they dispersed be. “Reflect on these; let not an houre of time “Want the dimension of a precious line. “Our Warfare's passing short, our Conquest great, “'Tis shame for reverend age to make retreat “Or yeeld one foot of ground, or weakly crave “A Parly when one foot is in the Grave. “It sounds not well that a light-youthfull rage “Should claime acquaintance on decrepit age. “An Old-mans houres should princely patterns give “To younger yeares, and teach them how to live. “Yet, Sir, misconster not my words I pray, “Your parts doe please us, though your haires be gray; “No aged wrinkle see I in your brow “Which with my soule I beare not reverence to; “No houre so tedious as when you'r from home, “No newes so cheerfull as to heare you'r come. “Begot of fancy my embraces be, “Which scorne to cloze with any one but thee. “O let me then enjoy what weeke by weeke “My six yeares widdowhood did solely seeke! “Let not a Nights distemper e're divide “My deare Musæus from his Panthea's side. “But if he doe, all passion I'le exile, “And tax his errour with a pleasing smile. “Such shall my Lecture be, which if it move “I live, if not, I cannot leave my love: “For such effects h'as true affection wrought, “T'enjoy thy selfe is all, all else is nought. Now tell me, are not these such sweet regreetes They'd weane a profest Lecher from the sheets Of an enchanting Syren? Could one teare Droppe from a disposition that's so cleare From all dissembled passion, and depart Without a deepe impression in the heart? Could vowels lose their life, and turne to ayre That were pronounc'd by one so good and faire? No, no; I hold no Eloquence so strong As when it falls from a calme Womans tongue. A Traveller may by experience finde That Sunne-beames are more violent then the Winde. These pierce the pores, and by their powerfull heat Resolve his native moisture to a sweat. Meane time, though Windes with boundlesse fury blow, They doe not show their active motion so As those reflecting beamlings: whence collect “Calme ayres produce the soveraign'st effect. Nor doe I speake this, any one should tell her, Nor doe I praise her with a minde to sell her. For there's no earthly treasure that I see Can counterveile so rich a price as she: But to praise goodnesse in a vertuous Mate May others move in time to imitate Whats'ere they gracefull in another read, And in those steps religiously to tread. This have I in a faire Theatre seene By a rare Curtezan of rich esteeme Fully confirm'd: who hearing one commend The chast-devoted life and vertuous end Of an heroick Lady, who o'rethrowne Could not by him who conquer'd her, be won To his imbraces, but as't did become her, Contemned life, for to preserve her honour. “O, quoth this female hearer, that I might “Be made so happy as enjoy the sight “Of such a None-such: I should scorne these tyres “(Times toyes) and cloath me with her chast desires, “And th' patterne of her goodnesse so apply, “As in her Service I would live and dye. This gravell'd all the Actors; but her hart What e're they did, could not forget her Part Which she so well perform'd, as that same night This Curtezan became a Convertite. Some other graces I could feature too, Which to a judgement give a beauteous show Because they have no varnish to adorne Their sweet condition with a borrow'd forme. And trust me, in such colours I'de portray them As they should need no Herald to display them, Were it not that so many antient Dames Whose very yeares should tender their good names, Seeing her gracefull vertues so approv'd And by herselfe improv'd, and therefore lov'd, Might hold their actions blemish'd, when they heare So pure a light fixt in a lower Spheare. First, youthfull widdowes, I appeale to you, Who, loth to lose th' benevolence that's due, Upon your Second marriage, cry alas—! “O what a brave Blade my first Husband was! “How pliable to me at bed and boord, “How active in his worke, true to his word! “What prettie toyes (such was his loving care) “He would have brought me home from every Faire! “The first ripe Cherry that was to be sold, “Could it have purchas'd bene with weight of gold “Had bene presented me: were Pease-cods deare? “They had bene mine ith' non-age of the yeare. “No gossip feast, but I might be invited, “Where though I revell'd till I was benighted, “Good man, he would sit up, till I came in, “And with sweet language my affection win. “If I but frown'd, hee'd weepe like any Child, “And fast from meat till he was reconcil'd. “No forraigne fashion, cost it ne're so much, “But I must have't, his fancy it was such; “I had mine owne will too in every thing, “Which to that height of spirit did me bring, “As what I knew for best I would not doe, “Because my Husband had a mind thereto: “So as I often alter'd my intent “Because he wish'd me doe that which I ment. “An agile Husband too, to crowne my wish, “But I find no such activenesse in this. “His spirit resteth onely in command, “His soveraignty to have the upper hand; “But since to be my head it is his happe, “I vow, that to that head I'le be the cappe. “To temper then a nature that's so curst, “Wee'l strive who shall enjoy the Buckler first. But cheerfull is my Panthea, and desires To feed her fancy with diviner fires. It cannot her sweet disposition please To twit her last Choice with abilities Of her first Husband: Such discourse, sayes she, Tasts more of lightnesse then of modestie. Her actions are all noble, and her speech So full of gravity, as it may teach The antient'st morall Dame, how to behave Herselfe both for the World and the Grave. Admit she be no Helena of Greece, Whose beauty wrought that tragicall increase Of Princely Funeralls: it was my care To set my fancy on an inward-faire, Whose never-fading Lillies might survive The richest piece of beauty that's alive; And in her passage hence more sweetnesse breath, Then thousand Hero's when surpriz'd by death. For tell me what's this skin-deepe beautie worth When her diviner spirit is let forth T'enjoy her freedome! Where are then those Starres Whose love-attractive lights commenc'd such warres With all the Senses! Sunke to such dark formes As they are Cranies made to harbour Wormes. Where those enazur'd brests which did supply With luscious Objects loves-enamour'd eye! Teats for those slimy wormlings now to pull Which wanton fancie used once to cull. Where that aspiring front, that mount of grace, That dimpled chin, that modell of a face More pure then Cynthia's? nay, ev'ry lim Where fancie bath'd her liqu'rish senses in? All husht in Earth: no motion to be found Unlesse by worme-sprouts shaken in the ground. This outward faire then it is little worth, Since it receives her tincture from the earth, Whereto it must by native course returne, And so enshrine her beautie in an Urne. 'Las poore Vermillion Earth! how is that state Which shew'd such braving postures in her gate Resolv'd to mouldred dust? where every graine Proves to the world, that the world is vaine. Give me that wench (and I have such an One) No daintie Leda, nor no homely Jone, Where any one may read each day oth' weeke “Some morall-mortall Lecture in her Cheeke. Where wrinkles write deepe furrowes in her face, While ev'ry rivell do'es afford a grace To her beseeming age: that, should we lack Climact'rick yeares within an Almanack, Her rev'rend brow might pencile out that want And find an Errand for Deaths Pursevant. Pray then resolve me, may she not become A Sibyl-Sister of our Meaning his Espousall with the Heliconian Muse to whose Hyminæall honour He addresseth this heavenly hymn. Hellicon, Who can contract her browes without a loure, Weare ages liv'rie, and ne're looke soure? Enjoy her Husband with a just delight, And with discretion coole her appetite? Feed her affection with the least of Sense, And make her wrinkles gaine a reverence? Live chast to him she loves, and to that line Confine those rich dimensions of her time? Yes; she or none! and she it is or none Whom I'm resolv'd to set my love upon. That since my Panarete lives in blisse, My HYMENS heavenly Hymne may cloze with this. FINIS. Upon this Poem. Some will collect from hence (they cannot chuse) That I'm espous'd; so am I to my Muse. Whose presence yeelds such solace to my life, I would not change with OVERBERIE'S wife. Toyes, Tyres and Dressings take not her desires, She feeds her fancie with diviner fires; Which so enliven me when I turne to her, “Though I enjoy her, night by night I woo her. My Hymenæall-Heav'nly Hymne is this, “Christ Jesus is my Spouse, and I am his. That MUSE which is not dedicate to Him “Breakes her First faith, and soiles her Bed with sin. Astræa's Shrine. To those who cherish Vertue, or retaine The style of reall good, or scorne to staine Astræa's Liv'ry; or fancy that Which the High Court of Honour levells at, Or to their Countreys and their owne behoofe Prove in the Scale Parl'amentary proofe; Who guild not Pietie with meere pretence, Nor render judgement 'gainst their conscience; Weare their Prætorian Scarlet till't wax old, And value Justice more then Ophir-gold; Who feare no Writs of Ease, but take delight To doe the Widdow and the Orphan right, Or store the Almes-basket, or provide For such as have no Earthly Helpes beside, Or purchase poormens prayers, or leave their Heires Seaz'd lesse of acres then religious cares, Or with a pure and undefiled Zeale Disturbe not peace of Church nor Commonweale; Or when they sit on Seats of Justice tremble, Remembring on those Thrones whom they resemble: To those this aged Shrine we reared have, Will be a Lampe to light them to their Grave, From whence such precious Odours shall take breath, As may perfume their Ashes after death.</field>
