THE SHEPHERD'S HUNTING To those honoured, noble, and right virtuous friends, my visitants in the Marshalsea: And to all other my unknown favourers, who either privately or publicly wished me well in my imprisonment. THE FIRST ECLOGUE. Willy leaves his flock awhile The Argument. Willy leaves his flock awhile, To lament his friend's exile; Where, though prison'd, he doth find, He's still free that's free in mind: And that there is no defence Half so firm as innocence. Philarete. Willy. Philarete. Willy, thou now full jolly tun'st thy reeds, Making the nymphs enamour'd on thy strains, And whilst thy harmless flock unscared feeds, Hast the contentment of hills, groves, and plains: Trust me, I joy thou and thy Muse so speeds In such an age, where so much mischief reigns: And to my care it some redress will be, Fortune hath so much grace to smile on thee. Willy. To smile on me? I ne'er yet knew her smile, Unless 'twere when she purposed to deceive me; Many a train, and many a painted wile She casts, in hope of freedom to bereave me: Yet now, because she sees I scorn her guile To fawn on fools, she for my Muse doth leave me. And here of late, her wonted spite doth tend To work me care, by frowning on my friend. Philarete. Why then I see her copper coin's no starling, 'Twill not be current still, for all the gilding, A knave or fool must ever be her darling, For they have minds to all occasions yielding: If we get anything by all our parling, It seems an apple, but it proves a wilding: But let that pass: sweet shepherd, tell me this, For what beloved friend thy sorrow is? Willy. Art thou, Philarete, in durance here, And dost thou ask me for what friend I grieve? Can I suppose thy love to me is dear, Or this thy joy for my content believe? When thou think'st thy cares touch not me as near: Or that I pin thy sorrows at my sleeve? I have in thee reposed so much trust, I never thought to find thee so unjust. Philarete. Why, Willy? Willy. Prithee do not ask me why. Doth it diminish any of thy care, That I in freedom maken melody; And think'st I cannot as well somewhat spare From my delight, to moan thy misery? 'Tis time our loves should these suspects forbear: Thou art that friend, which thou unnamed should'st know, And not have drawn my love in question so. Philarete. Forgive me, and I'll pardon thy mistake, And so let this thy gentle anger cease; I never of thy love will question make Whilst that the number of our days increase, Yet to myself I much might seem to take, And something near unto presumption prease, To think me worthy love from such a spirit, But that I know thy kindness past my merit. Besides, methought thou spak'st now of a friend, That seem'd more grievous discontents to bear, Some things I find that do in show offend, Which to my patience little trouble are, And they ere long I hope will have an end; Or though they have not, much I do not care: So this it was made me that question move, And not suspect of honest Willy's love. Willy. Alas, thou art exiled from thy flock, And, quite beyond the deserts here confined, Hast nothing to converse with but a rock, Or at least outlaws in their caves half pined: And dost thou at thy own misfortune mock, Making thyself too to thyself unkind? When heretofore we talk'd we did embrace; But now I scarce can come to see thy face. Philarete. Yet all that, Willy, is not worth thy sorrow, For I have mirth here thou would'st not believe; From deepest cares the highest joys I borrow. If ought chance out this day may make me grieve, I'll learn to mend, or scorn it by to-morrow. This barren place yields somewhat to relieve: For, I have found sufficient to content me, And more true bliss than ever freedom lent me. Willy. Are prisons then grown places of delight? Philarete. 'Tis as the conscience of the prisoner is; The very grates are able to affright The guilty man, that knows his deeds amiss; All outward pleasures are exiled quite, And it is nothing (of itself) but this: Abhorred loneness, darkness, sadness, pains Numb cold, sharp hunger, scorching thirst, and chains. Willy. And these are nothing? Philarete. Nothing yet to me. Only my friends' restraint is all my pain. And since I truly find my conscience free, From that my loneness too I reap some gain. Willy. But grant in this no discontentment be, It doth thy wished liberty restrain: And to thy soul I think there's nothing nearer, For I could never hear thee prize ought dearer. Philarete. True, I did ever set it at a rate Too dear for any mortal's worth to buy, 'Tis not our greatest shepherd's whole estate Shall purchase from me my least liberty: But I am subject to the powers of fate, And to obey them is no slavery: They may do much, but when they have done all, Only my body they may bring in thrall. And 'tis not that, my Willy, 'tis my mind; My mind's more precious freedom I so weigh, A thousand ways they may my body bind In thousand thralls, but ne'er my mind betray: And thence it is that I contentment find, And bear with patience this my load away: I'm still myself, and that I'd rather be, Than to be lord of all these downs in fee. Willy. Nobly resolved, and I do joy to hear 't, For 'tis the mind of man indeed that's all; There's nought so hard but a brave heart will bear 't; The guiltless men count great afflictions small, They'll look on death and torment, yet not fear 't, Because they know 'tis rising so to fall: Tyrants may boast they to much power are born, Yet he hath more than tyrannies can scorn. Philarete. 'Tis right, but I no tyrannies endure, Nor have I suffered ought worth name of care. Willy. Whate'er thou'lt call 't, thou may'st, but I am sure, Many more pine that much less pained are: Thy look methinks doth say thy meaning's pure And by this past I find what thou dost dare: But I could never yet the reason know, Why thou art lodged in this house of woe. Philarete. Nor I, by Pan, nor never hope to do, But thus it pleases some; and I do guess Partly a cause that moves them thereunto, Which neither will avail me to express, Nor thee to hear, and therefore let it go; We must not say, they do so that oppress: Yet I shall ne'er, to soothe them or the times, Injure myself by bearing others' crimes. Willy. Then now thou may'st speak freely, there's none hears, But he, whom I do hope thou dost not doubt. Philarete. True: but if doors and walls have gotten ears, And closet-whisperings may be spread about, Do not blame him that in such causes fears What in his passion he may blunder out, In such a place, and such strict times as these, Where what we speak is took as others please. But yet to-morrow, if thou come this way, I'll tell thee all my story to the end; 'Tis long, and now I fear thou canst not stay, Because thy flock must watered be and penned, And night begins to muffle up the day, Which to inform thee how alone I spend, I'll only sing a sorry prisoner's lay I framed this morn, which though it suits not fields, Is such as fits me, and sad thraldom yields. Willy. Well, I will set my kit another string, And play unto it whilst that thou dost sing. Philarete. SONNET. Now that my body dead-alive, Bereaved of comfort, lies in thrall, Do thou, my soul, begin to thrive, And unto honey turn this gall; So shall we both through outward woe, The way to inward comfort know. As to the flesh we food do give, To keep in us this mortal breath: So souls on meditations live And shun thereby immortal death; Nor art thou ever nearer rest, Than when thou find'st me most opprest. First think, my soul, if I have foes That take a pleasure in my care, And to procure these outward woes, Have thus entrapped me unaware; Thou should'st by much more careful be. Since greater foes lay wait for thee. Then when mew'd up in grates of steel, Minding those joys mine eyes do miss, Thou find'st no torment thou dost feel, So grievous as privation is; Muse how the damn'd, in flames that glow, Pine in the loss of bliss they know. Thou seest there's given so great might To some that are but clay as I; Their very anger can affright, Which, if in any thou espy, Thus think; if mortals' frowns strike fear, How dreadful will God's wrath appear? By my late hopes that now are crost, Consider those that firmer be: And make the freedom I have lost, A means that may remember thee: Had Christ not thy redeemer bin, What horrid thrall thou had'st been in. These iron chains, these bolts of steel, Which other poor offenders grind, The wants and cares which they do feel, May bring some greater thing to mind; For by their grief thou shalt do well, To think upon the pains of hell. Or, when through me thou seest a man Condemn'd unto a mortal death, How sad he looks, how pale, how wan, Drawing with fear his panting breath; Think, if in that such grief thou see, How sad will âGo, ye cursed,â be. Again, when he that fear'd to die Past hope doth see his pardon brought, Read but the joy that's in his eye, And then convey it to thy thought; There think, betwixt thy heart and thee, How sweet will âCome, ye blessed,â be. Thus if thou do, though closed here, My bondage I shall deem the less, I neither shall have cause to fear, Nor yet bewail my sad distress; For whether live, or pine, or die, We shall have bliss eternally. Willy. Trust me I see the cage doth some birds good, And, if they do not suffer too much wrong, Will teach them sweeter descants than the wood: Believe 't, I like the subject of thy song, It shows thou art in no distempered mood: But 'cause to hear the residue I long, My sheep to-morrow I will nearer bring, And spend the day to hear thee talk and sing. Yet ere we part, Philarete, arede, Of whom thou learn'dst to make such songs as these, I never yet heard any shepherd's reed Tune in mishap a strain that more could please; Surely thou dost invoke at this thy need Some power that we neglect in other lays: For here's a name and words that but few swains Have mention'd at their meeting on the plains. Philarete. Indeed 'tis true; and they are sore to blame, They do so much neglect it in their songs, For thence proceedeth such a worthy fame, As is not subject unto envy's wrongs: That is the most to be respected name Of our true Pan, whose worth sits on all tongues; And the most ancient shepherds use to praise In sacred anthems, sung on holy days. He that first taught his music such a strain Was that sweet shepherd, who, until a king, Kept sheep upon the honey-milky plain, That is enrich'd by Jordan's watering; He in his troubles eased the body's pain By measures raised to the soul's ravishing: And his sweet numbers only most divine Gave the first being to this song of mine. Willy. Let his good spirit ever with thee dwell, That I might hear such music every day. Philarete. Thanks, swains: but hark, thy wether rings his bell. And, swains, to fold, or homeward drive away. Willy. And yon goes Cuddy; therefore fare thou well; I'll make his sheep for me a little stay; And, if thou think it fit, I'll bring him too Next morning hither. Philarete. Prithee, Willy, do. THE SECOND ECLOGUE. Cuddy here relates The Argument. Cuddy here relates, how all Pity Philarete's thrall; Who, requested, doth relate The true cause of his estate; Which broke off, because 'twas long, They begin a three-man song. Willy. Cuddy. Philarete. Willy. Lo, Philaret, thy old friend here, and I, Are come to visit thee in these thy bands, Whilst both our flocks in an enclosure by Do pick the thin grass from the fallowed lands. He tells me thy restraint of liberty Each one throughout the country understands, And there is not a gentle-natured lad On all these downs, but for thy sake is sad. Cuddy. Not thy acquaintance and thy friends alone Pity thy close restraint, as friends should do, But some, that have but seen thee, for thee moan; Yea, many that did never see thee too. Some deem thee in a fault, and most in none; So divers ways do divers rumours go; And at all meetings where our shepherds be, Now the main news that's extant is of thee. Philarete. Why, this is somewhat yet: had I but kept Sheep on the mountains till the day of doom, My name should in obscurity have slept In brakes, in briars, shrubbed furze and broom; Into the world's wide ear it had not crept, Nor in so many men's thoughts found a room: But what cause of my suffering do they know? Good Cuddy, tell me, how doth rumour go? Cuddy. Faith, 'tis uncertain; some speak this, some that: Some dare say nought, yet seem to think a cause, And many a one, prating he knows not what, Comes out with proverbs and old ancient saws, As if he thought thee guiltless, and yet not: Then doth he speak half sentences, then pause: That what the most would say, we may suppose; But what to say the rumour is, none knows. Philarete. Nor care I greatly, for it skills not much What the unsteady common-people deems; His conscience doth not always feel least touch That blameless in the sight of others seems: My cause is honest, and because 'tis such, I hold it so, and not for men's esteems: If they speak justly well of me, I'm glad; If falsely evil, it ne'er makes me sad. Willy. I like that mind: but, shepherd, you are quite Beside the matter that I long to hear: Remember what you promised yester-night, You'd put us off with other talk, I fear; Thou know'st that honest Cuddy's heart's upright, And none but he, except myself, is near: Come, therefore, and betwixt us two relate The true occasion of thy present state. Philarete. My friends, I will; you know I am a swain, That keep a poor flock on a barren plain: Who, though it seems I could do nothing less, Can make a song, and woo a shepherdess. And not alone the fairest where I live, Have heard me sing, and favours deigned to give: But, though I say 't, the noblest nymph of Thame Hath graced my verse, unto my greater fame. Yet, being young, and not much seeking praise, I was not noted out for shepherds' lays Nor feeding flocks, as, you know, others be: For the delight that most possessed me Was hunting foxes, wolves, and beasts of prey That spoil our folds, and bear our lambs away. For this, as also for the love I bear Unto my country, I laid by all care Of gain, or of preferment, with desire Only to keep that state I had entire, And like a true-grown huntsman sought to speed Myself with hounds of rare and choicest breed, Whose names and natures, ere I further go, Because you are my friends I'll let you know. My first-esteemed dog that I did find, Was by descent of old ActÃ¦on's kind; A brach, which if I do not aim amiss, For all the world is just like one of his: She's named Love, and scarce yet knows her duty; Her dam's my lady's pretty beagle, Beauty. I bred her up myself with wondrous charge, Until she grew to be exceeding large, And wax'd so wanton, that I did abhor it, And put her out amongst my neighbours for it. The next is Lust, a hound that's kept abroad 'Mongst some of mine acquaintance; but a toad Is not more loathsome: 'tis a cur will range Extremely, and is ever full of mange: And 'cause it is infectious, she's not wont To come among the rest, but when they hunt. Hate is the third, a hound both deep and long: His sire is true, or else supposed, Wrong. He'll have a snap at all that pass him by, And yet pursues his game most eagerly. With him goes Envy coupled, a lean cur, And yet she'll hold out, hunt we ne'er so far: She pineth much, and feedeth little too, Yet stands and snarleth at the rest that do. Then there's Revenge, a wondrous deep-mouthed dog, So fleet I'm fain to hunt him with a clog, Yet many times he'll much outstrip his bounds, And hunts not closely with the other hounds: He'll venture on a lion in his ire: Curst Choler was his dam, and Wrong his sire. This Choler is a brach that's very old, And spends her mouth too much to have it hold: She's very testy; an unpleasing cur, That bites the very stones, if they but stir: Or when that ought but her displeasure moves, She'll bite and snap at any one she loves. But my quick-scented'st dog is Jealousy; The truest of this breed's in Italy. The dam of mine would hardly fill a glove, It was a lady's little dog, called Love: The sire, a poor deformed cur, named Fear, As shagged and as rough as is a bear: And yet the whelp turn'd after neither kind, For he is very large, and near-hand blind. Far off, he seemeth of a pretty colour, But doth not prove so when you view him fuller. A vile suspicious beast, whose looks are bad, And I do fear in time he will grow mad. To him I couple Avarice, still poor, Yet she devours as much as twenty more; A thousand horse she in her paunch can put, Yet whine as if she had an empty gut; And having gorged what might a land have found, She'll catch for more, and hide it in the ground. Ambition is a hound as greedy full, But he for all the daintiest bits doth cull; He scorns to lick up crumbs beneath the table, He'll fetch 't from boards and shelves, if he be able; Nay, he can climb, if need be; and for that With him I hunt the marten and the cat: And yet sometimes in mounting, he's so quick He fetches falls are like to break his neck. Fear is well-mouthed, but subject to distrust; A stranger cannot make him take a crust: A little thing will soon his courage quail, And 'twixt his legs he ever claps his tail. With him Despair now often coupled goes, Which by his roaring mouth each huntsman knows. None hath a better mind unto the game; But he gives off, and always seemeth lame. My bloodhound Cruelty, as swift as wind, Hunts to the death, and never comes behind; Who, but she's strapp'd and muzzled too withal, Would eat her fellows and the prey and all. And yet she cares not much for any food Unless it be the purest harmless blood. All these are kept abroad at charge of many; They do not cost me in a year a penny. But there's two couple of a middling size, That seldom pass the sight of my own eyes. Hope, on whose head I've laid my life to pawn; Compassion, that on every one will fawn. This would, when 'twas a whelp, with rabbits play Or lambs, and let them go unhurt away: Nay, now she is of growth, she'll now and then Catch you a hare, and let her go again. The two last, Joy and Sorrow, make me wonder, For they can ne'er agree, nor bide asunder. Joy's ever wanton, and no order knows, She'll run at larks, or stand and bark at crows. Sorrow goes by her, and ne'er moves his eye: Yet both do serve to help make up the cry: Then comes behind all these to bear the base, Two couple more of a far larger race, Such wide-mouth'd trollops, that 'twould do you good, To hear their loud-loud echoes tear the wood: There's Vanity, who by her gaudy hide May far away from all the rest be spied, Though huge, yet quick, for she's now here, now there; Nay, look about you, and she's everywhere: Yet ever with the rest, and still in chase, Right so, Inconstancy fills every place; And yet so strange a fickle-natured hound, Look for her, and she's nowhere to be found. Weakness is no fair dog unto the eye, And yet she hath her proper quality. But there's Presumption; when he heat hath got, He drowns the thunder, and the cannon-shot: And when at start he his full roaring makes, The earth doth tremble, and the heaven shakes: These were my dogs, ten couple just in all, Whom by the name of Satyrs I do call: Mad curs they be, and I can ne'er come nigh them, But I'm in danger to be bitten by them. Much pains I took, and spent days not a few, To make them keep together, and hunt true: Which yet I do suppose had never bin, But that I had a Scourge to keep them in. Now when that I this kennel first had got, Out of mine own demesnes I hunted not, Save on these downs, or among yonder rocks, After those beasts that spoiled our parish flocks: Nor during that time was I ever wont With all my kennel in one day to hunt: Nor had done yet, but that this other year, Some beasts of prey that haunt the deserts here Did not alone for many nights together Devour, sometime a lamb, sometime a wether, And so disquiet many a poor man's herd, But that of losing all they were afeared. Yea, I among the rest did fare as bad, Or rather worse; for the best ewes I had, Whose breed should be my means of life and gain, Were in one evening by these monsters slain: Which mischief I resolved to repay, Or else grow desperate and hunt all away. For in a fury such as you shall see Huntsmen in missing of their sport will be, I vowed a monster should not lurk about In all this province, but I'd find him out; And thereupon, without respect or care How lame, how full, or how unfit they were, In haste unkennell'd all my roaring crew, Who were as mad, as if my mind they knew; And ere they trail'd a flight-shot, the fierce curs, Had roused a hart, and through brakes, briars, and furze Follow'd at gaze so close, that Love and Fear Got in together, and had surely there Quite overthrown him, but that Hope thrust in 'Twixt both, and saved the pinching of his skin. Whereby he 'scaped, till coursing overthwart, Despair came in, and gripp'd him to the heart. I halloed in the res'due to the fall, And for an entrance there I flesh'd them all: Which having done, I dipp'd my staff in blood, And onward led my thunder to the wood; Where what they did, I'll tell you out anon; My keeper calls me, and I must be gone. Go, if you please, awhile attend your flocks, And when the sun is over yonder rocks, Come to this cave again, where I will be, If that my guardian so much favour me. Yet, if you please, let us three sing a strain, Before you turn your sheep into the plain. Willy. I am content. Cuddy. As well content am I. Philarete. Then Will begin, and we'll the rest supply. SONG. Willy. Shepherd, would these gates were ope; Thou might'st take with us thy fortune. Philarete. No, I'll make this narrow scope, Since my fate doth so importune, Means unto a wider hope. Cuddy. Would thy shepherdess were here, Who beloved loves thee so dearly. Philarete. Not for both your flocks, I swear, And the gain they yield you yearly, Would I so much wrong my dear Yet to me, nor to this place, Would she now be long a stranger. She would hold it no disgrace, If she fear'd not more my danger, Where I am to show her face. Willy. Shepherd, we would wish no harms, But something that might content thee. Philarete. Wish me then within her arms, And that wish will ne'er repent me, If your wishes might prove charms. Willy. Be thy prison her embrace, Be thy air her sweetest breathing. Cuddy. Be thy prospect her sweet face, For each look a kiss bequeathing, And appoint thyself the place. Philarete. Nay pray, hold there, for I should scantly then Come meet you here this afternoon again; But fare you well, since wishes have no power, Let us depart and keep the pointed hour. THE THIRD ECLOGUE. Philaret with his three friends The Argument. Philaret with his three friends; Here his hunting story ends. Kind Alexis with much ruth Wails the banish'd shepherd's youth. But he slighteth fortune's stings, And in spite of thraldom sings. Philarete. Cuddy. Alexis. Willy. Philarete. So, now I see y' are shepherds of your word, Thus were you wont to promise, and to do. Cuddy. More than our promise is, we can afford; We come ourselves, and bring another too, Alexis, whom thou know'st well is no foe, Who loves thee much; and I do know that he Would fain a hearer of thy hunting be. Philarete. Alexis, you are welcome, for you know You cannot be but welcome where I am; You ever were a friend of mine in show, And I have found you are indeed the same: Upon my first restraint you hither came, And proffered me more tokens of your love, Than it were fit my small deserts should prove. Alexis. 'Tis still your use to underprize your merit; Be not so coy to take my proffered love, 'Twill neither unbeseem your worth nor spirit. To offer court'sy doth thy friend behove: And which are so, this is a place to prove. Then once again I say, if cause there be, First make a trial, if thou please, of me. Philarete. Thanks, good Alexis; sit down by me here, I have a task, these shepherds know, to do; A tale already told this morn well near, With which I very fain would forward go, And am as willing thou should'st hear it too: But thou canst never understand this last, Till I have also told thee what is past. Willy. It shall not need, for I so much presumed, I on your mutual friendships might be bold, That I a freedom to myself assumed To make him know what is already told. If I have done amiss, then you may scold. But in my telling I prevised this, He knew not whose, nor to what end it is. Philarete. Well, now he may, for here my tale goes on: My eager dogs and I to wood are gone, Where, beating through the coverts, every hound A several game had in a moment found: I rated them, but they pursued their prey, And as it fell (by hap) took all one way. Then I began with quicker speed to follow, And teased them on with a more cheerful hollo, That soon we passed many weary miles, Tracing the subtle game through all their wiles. These doubled, those redoubled on the scent, Still keeping in full chase where'er they went, Up hills, down cliffs, through bogs, and over plains, Stretching their music to the highest strains. That when some thicket hid them from mine eye, My ear was ravish'd with their melody. Nor cross'd we only ditches, hedges, furrows, But hamlets, tithings, parishes, and boroughs: They followed wheresoe'er the game did go, Through kitchen, parlour, hall, and chamber too. And, as they pass'd the city, and the court, My prince look'd out, and deigned to view my sport; Which then, although I suffer for it now, If some say true he liking did allow; And so much, had I had but wit to stay, I might myself perhaps have heard him say. But I, that time, as much as any daring, More for my pleasure than my safety caring; Seeing fresh game from every covert rise, Crossing by thousands still before their eyes, After I rush'd, and following close my hounds, Some beasts I found lie dead, some full of wounds, Among the willows, scarce with strength to move: One I found here, another there, whom Love Had gripp'd to death: and, in the self-same state, Lay one devoured by Envy, one by Hate; Lust had bit some, but I soon passed beside them, Their fester'd wounds so stunk, none could abide them. Choler hurt divers, but Revenge kill'd more: Fear frightened all, behind him and before. Despair drave on a huge and mighty heap, Forcing some down from rocks and hills to leap, Some into water, some into the fire; So on themselves he made them wreak his ire. But I remember, as I pass'd that way, Where the great king and prince of shepherds lay, About the walls were hid some, once more known, That my fell cur Ambition had o'erthrown: Many I heard, pursued by Pity, cry; And oft I saw my blood-hound, Cruelty, Eating her passage even to the heart, Whither once gotten, she is loth to part. All plied it well, and made so loud a cry, 'Twas heard beyond the shores of Britany. Some rated them, some storm'd, some liked the game, Some thought me worthy praise, some worthy blame. But I, not fearing th' one, mis-'steeming t'other, Both in shrill hallooes and loud yearnings smother. Yea, the strong mettled and my long-breath'd crew, Seeing the game increasing in their view, Grew the more frolic, and the course's length Gave better breath, and added to their strength. Which Jove perceiving, for Jove heard their cries Rumbling amongst the spheres' concavities, He mark'd their course, and courage's increase, Saying, 'twere pity such a chase should cease. And therewith swore their mouths should never waste, But hunt as long 's mortality did last. Soon did they feel the power of his great gift, And I began to find their pace more swift: I follow'd, and I rated, but in vain Strived to o'ertake, or take them up again. They never stayed since, nor nights nor days, But to and fro still run a thousand ways: Yea, often to this place where now I lie, They'll wheel about to cheer me with their cry; And one day in good time will vengeance take On some offenders, for their master's sake: For know, my friends, my freedom in this sort For them I lose, and making myself sport. Willy. Why, was there any harm at all in this? Philarete. No, Willy, and I hope yet none there is. Willy. How comes it then? Philarete. Note, and I'll tell thee how. Thou know'st that truth and innocency now, If placed with meanness, suffers more despite Than villainies accompanied with might. But thus it fell, while that my hounds pursued Their noisome prey, and every field lay strew'd With monsters, hurt and slain,âupon a beast More subtle and more noisome than the rest, My lean-flank'd bitch, call'd Envy, hapt to light; And, as her wont is, did so surely bite That, though she left behind small outward smart, The wounds were deep, and rankled to the heart. This, joining to some other, that of late Were very eagerly pursued by Hate, To fit their purpose having taken leisure, Did thus conspire to work me a displeasure. For imitation far surpassing apes, They laid aside their fox and wolfish shapes, And shrouded in the skins of harmless sheep Into by-ways and open paths did creep; Where they, as hardly drawing breath, did lie, Showing their wounds to every passer by, To make them think that they were sheep so foil'd, And by my dogs, in their late hunting, spoil'd. Beside, some other that envied my game, And, for their pastime, kept such monsters tameâ As, you do know, there's many for their pleasure Keep foxes, bears, and wolves, as some great treasure Yea, many get their living by them too, And so did store of these, I speak of, doâ Who, seeing that my kennel had affrighted, Or hurt some vermin wherein they delighted, And finding their own power by much too weak Their malice on my innocence to wreak, Swoll'n with the deepest rancour of despite Some of our greatest shepherds' folds by night They closely entered; and there having stain'd Their hands in villainy, of me they plain'd Affirming, without shame or honesty, I and my dogs had done it purposely. Whereat they storm'd, and call'd me to a trial, Where innocence prevails not, nor denial: But for that cause here in this place I lie, Where none so merry as my dogs and I. Cuddy. Believe it, here's a tale will suiten well, For shepherds in another age to tell. Willy. And thou shalt be remember'd with delight By this hereafter, many a winter's night; For of this sport another age will ring; Yea, nymphs that are unborn thereof shall sing, And not a beauty on our greens shall play That hath not heard of this thy hunting day. Philarete. It may be so, for if that gentle swain Who woos by Tavy on the western plain, Would make the song, such life his verse can give, Then I do know my name might ever live. Alexis. But tell me, are our plains and nymphs forgot, And canst thou frolic in thy trouble be? Philarete. Can I, Alexis, say'st thou? Can I not, That am resolved to scorn more misery? Alexis. Oh, but thy youth's yet green, and young blood hot, And liberty must needs be sweet to thee, But now most sweet, whilst every bushy vale And grove and hill rings of the nightingale. Methinks, when thou rememberest those sweet lays Which thou would'st lead thy shepherdess to hear Each evening-tide among the leafy sprays, The thought of that should make thy freedom dear; For now, whilst every nymph on holidays Sports with some jolly lad, and maketh cheer, Thine sighs for thee, and mew'd up from resort, Will neither play herself, nor see their sport. Those shepherds that were many a morning wont Unto their boys to leave the tender herd, And bear thee company when thou didst huntâ Methinks the sport thou hast so gladly shared Among those swains should make thee think upon 't, For 't seems all vain now, that was once endear'd. It cannot be, since I could make relation How for less cause thou hast been deep in passion. Philarete. 'Tis true: my tender heart was ever yet Too capable of such conceits as these; I never saw that object, but from it The passions of my love I could increase. Those things which move not other men a whit, I can and do make use of, if I please: When I am sad, to sadness I apply Each bird, and tree, and flower that I pass by. So, when I will be merry, I as well Something for mirth from everything can draw, From misery, from prisons, nay, from hell: And as, when to my mind grief gives a flaw, Best comforts do but make my woes more fell, So when I'm bent to mirth, from mischief's paw, Though seized upon me, I would something cull, That spite of care should make my joys more full. I feel those wants, Alexis, thou dost name, Which spite of youth's affections I sustain; Or else, for what is 't I have gotten fame, And am more known than many an elder swain, If such desires I had not learn'd to tame, Since many pipe much better on this plain? But tune your reeds, and I will in a song Express my care, and how I take this wrong. SONNET. I that erstwhile the world's sweet air did draw Graced by the fairest ever mortal saw, Now closely pent with walls of ruthless stone, Consume my days and nights and all alone. When I was wont to sing of shepherds' loves, My walks were fields, and downs, and hills, and groves: But now, alas! so strict is my hard doom, Fields, downs, hills, groves, and all's but one poor room. Each morn, as soon as daylight did appear, With nature's music birds would charm mine ear; Which now, instead of their melodious strains, Hear rattling shackles, gyves, and bolts, and chains. But though that all the world's delight forsake me, I have a Muse, and she shall music make me; Whose airy notes, in spite of closest cages, Shall give content to me, and after ages. Nor do I pass for all this outward ill, My heart's the same, and undejected still; And, which is more than some in freedom win, I have true rest, and peace, and joy within. And then my mind, that spite of prison's free, Whene'er she pleases anywhere can be; She's in an hour in France, Rome, Turkey, Spain, In earth, in hell, in heaven, and here again. Yet there's another comfort in my woe; My cause is spread, and all the world may know My fault's no more but speaking truth and reason; Nor debt, nor theft, nor murder, rape, or treason. Nor shall my foes, with all their might and power, Wipe out their shame, nor yet this fame of our: Which when they find, they shall my fate envy, Till they grow lean, and sick, and mad, and die. Then though my body here in prison rot, And my wrong'd satires seem awhile forgot: Yet when both fame and life hath left those men, My verse and I'll revive, and live again. So thus enclosed I bear affliction's load, But with more true content than some abroad; For whilst their thoughts do feel my scourge's sting, In bands I'll leap, and dance, and laugh, and sing. Alexis. Why now I see thou droop'st not with thy care, Neither exclaim'st thou on thy hunting day, But dost with unchanged resolution bear The heavy burthen of exile away. All that did truly know thee, did conceive Thy actions with thy spirit still agreed; Their good conceit thou dost no whit bereave, But shew'st that thou art still thyself indeed. If that thy mind to baseness now descends, Thou'lt injure virtue, and deceive thy friends. Willy. Alexis, he will injure virtue much, But more his friends, and most of all himself; If on that common bar his mind but touch, It wracks his fame upon disgrace's shelf. Whereas if thou steer on that happy course, Which in thy just adventure is begun, No thwarting tide nor adverse blast shall force Thy bark without the channel's bounds to run. Thou art the same thou wert, for ought I see, When thou didst freely on the mountains hunt; In nothing changed yet, unless it be More merrily disposed than thou wert wont. Still keep thee thus, so other men shall know, Virtue can give content in midst of woe; And see, though mightiness with frowns doth threat, That, to be innocent, is to be great. Thrive and farewell. Alexis. In this thy trouble flourish. Cuddy. While those that wish thee ill, fret, pine, and perish. THE FOURTH ECLOGUE. Philaret on Willy calls To his truely beloved loving Friend, Mr. William Browne of the Inner Temple. The Argument. Philaret on Willy calls, To sing out his pastorals, Warrants fame shall grace his rhymes Spite of envy and the times; And shows how in care he uses To take comfort from his Muses. Philarete. Willy. Philarete. Prithee, Willy, tell me this, What new accident there is, That thou, once the blithest lad, Art become so wondrous sad, And so careless of thy quill, As if thou had'st lost thy skill? Thou wert wont to charm thy flocks, And among the massy rocks Hast so cheer'd me with thy song, That I have forgot my wrong. Something hath thee surely crost, That thy old wont thou hast lost. Tell me, have I ought mis-said That hath made thee ill-a-paid? Hath some churl done thee a spite? Dost thou miss a lamb to-night? Frowns thy fairest shepherd's lass? Or how comes this ill to pass? Is there any discontent Worse than this my banishment? Willy. Why, doth that so evil seem That thou nothing worse dost deem? Shepherd, there full many be, That will change contents with thee. Those that choose their walks at will, On the valley or the hill, Or those pleasures boast of can, Groves or fields may yield to man, Never come to know the rest, Wherewithal thy mind is blest. Many a one that oft resorts To make up the troop at sports, And in company somewhile, Happens to strain forth a smile, Feels more want, more outward smart, And more inward grief of heart, Than this place can bring to thee, While thy mind remaineth free. Thou bewail'st my want of mirth, But what find'st thou in this earth, Wherein ought may be believed Worth to make me joy'd or grieved? And yet feel I, natheless, Part of both, I must confess. Sometime I of mirth do borrow, Otherwhile as much of sorrow; But my present state is such, As nor joy nor grieve I much. Philarete. Why hath Willy then so long Thus forborne his wonted song? Wherefore doth he now let fall His well-tuned pastoral, And my ears that music bar, Which I more long after far Than the liberty I want? Willy. That were very much to grant. But doth this hold alway, lad, Those that sing not must be sad? Did'st thou ever that bird hear Sing well, that sings all the year? Tom the Piper doth not play Till he wears his pipe away: There's a time to slack the string, And a time to leave to sing. Philarete. Yea, but no man now is still, That can sing or tune a quill. Now to chant it were but reason; Song and music are in season. Now in this sweet jolly tide, Is the earth in all her pride: The fair Lady of the May, Trimm'd up in her best array, Hath invited all the swains With the lasses of the plains, To attend upon her sport At the places of resort. Corydon with his bold rout Hath already been about For the elder shepherds' dole, And fetch'd in the summer-pole: Whilst the rest have built a bower, To defend them from a shower, Ciel'd so close, with boughs all green, Titan cannot pry between. Now the dairy-wenches dream Of their strawberries and cream, And each doth herself advance To be taken in to dance; Every one that knows to sing, Fits him for his carolling; So do those that hope for meed, Either by the pipe or reed: And though I am kept away, I do hear this very day Many learned grooms do wend For the garlands to contend, Which a nymph that hight Desart, Long a stranger in this part, With her own fair hand hath wrought A rare work, they say, past thought, As appeareth by the name, For she calls them wreaths of fame. She hath set in their due place Every flower that may grace; And among a thousand mo, Whereof some but serve for show, She hath wove in Daphne's tree, That they may not blasted be. Which with thyme she edged about, Lest the work should ravel out. And that it might wither never, Intermix'd it with live-ever. These are to be shared among, Those that do excel for song, Or their passions can rehearse In the smooth'st and sweetest verse. Then for those among the rest That can play and pipe the best, There's a kidling with the dam, A fat wether, and a lamb. And for those that leapen far, Wrestle, run, and throw the bar, There's appointed guerdons too: He that best the first can do, Shall, for his reward, be paid With a sheep-hook, fair inlaid With fine bone, of a strange beast That men bring from out the West: For the next, a scrip of red, Tassell'd with fine coloured thread: There's prepared for their meed That in running make most speed, Or the cunning measures foot, Cups of turned maple-root, Whereupon the skilful man Hath engraved the loves of Pan: And the last hath for his due, A fine napkin wrought with blue. Then, my Willy, why art thou Careless of thy merit now? What dost thou here with a wight That is shut up from delight In a solitary den, As not fit to live with men? Go, my Willy, get thee gone, Leave me in exile alone; Hie thee to that merry throng, And amaze them with thy song. Thou art young, yet such a lay Never graced the month of May, As, if they provoke thy skill, Thou canst fit unto thy quill; I with wonder heard thee sing, At our last year's revelling. Then I with the rest was free, When unknown I noted thee, And perceived the ruder swains Envy thy far sweeter strains. Yea, I saw the lasses cling Round about thee in a ring, As if each one jealous were Any but herself should hear. And I know they yet do long For the res'due of thy song. Haste thee then to sing it forth; Take the benefit of worth, And Desert will sure bequeathe Fame's fair garland for thy wreath; Hie thee, Willy, hie away. Willy. Phila, rather let me stay, And be desolate with thee, Than at those their revels be; Nought such is my skill, I wis, As indeed thou deem'st it is. But whate'er it be, I must Be content, and shall, I trust. For a song I do not pass 'Mong'st my friends, but what, alas! Should I have to do with them That my music do contemn? Some there are, as well I wot, That the same yet favour not; Yet I cannot well avow They my carols disallow; But such malice I have spied, 'Tis as much as if they did. Philarete. Willy, what may those men be Are so ill to malice thee? Willy. Some are worthy, well-esteem'd, Some without worth are so deem'd. Others of so base a spirit, They have nor esteem, nor merit. Philarete. What's the wrong? Willy. A slight offence, Wherewithal I can dispense; But hereafter for their sake To myself I'll music make. Philarete. What, because some clown offends, Wilt thou punish all thy friends? Willy. Do not, Phil, misunderstand me, Those that love me may command me; But, thou know'st, I am but young, And the pastoral I sung, Is by some supposed to be By a strain too high for me: So they kindly let me gain Not my labour for my pain. Trust me, I do wonder why They should me my own deny. Though I'm young, I scorn to flit On the wings of borrowed wit. I'll make my own feathers rear me Whither others cannot bear me. Yet I'll keep my skill in store, Till I've seen some winters more. Philarete. But, in earnest, mean'st thou so? Then thou art not wise, I trow: Better shall advise thee Pan, For thou dost not rightly than; That's the ready way to blot All the credit thou hast got. Rather in thy age's prime, Get another start of Time, And make those that so fond be, Spite of their own dulness see That the sacred Muses can Make a child in years a man. It is known what thou canst do, For it is not long ago, When that Cuddy, thou, and I, Each the others' skill to try, At Saint Dunstan's charmed well, As some present there can tell, Sang upon a sudden theme, Sitting by the crimson stream; Where if thou didst well or no, Yet remains the song to show. Much experience more I've had, Of thy skill, thou happy lad, And would make the world to know it, But that time will further show it. Envy makes their tongues now run More than doubt of what is done. For that needs must be thy own, Or to be some other's known: But how then will 't suit unto What thou shalt hereafter do? Or, I wonder, where is he Would with that song part to thee? Nay, were there so mad a swain, Could such glory sell for gain, PhÅbus would not have combined That gift with so base a mind. Never did the Nine impart The sweet secrets of their art Unto any that did scorn We should see their favours worn. Therefore unto those that say, Were they pleased to sing a lay, They could do 't, and will not tho', This I speak, for this I know; None e'er drunk the Thespian spring, And knew how, but he did sing. For that once infused in man Makes him show't, do what he can. Nay, those that do only sip, Or but ev'n their fingers dip In that sacred fount, poor elves, Of that brood will show themselves. Yea, in hope to get them fame, They will speak, though to their shame. Let those then at thee repine That by their wits measure thine; Needs those songs must be thine own, And that one day will be known. That poor imputation too, I myself do undergo; But it will appear ere long, That 'twas envy sought our wrong, Who at twice-ten have sung more Than some will do at fourscore. Cheer thee, honest Willy, then, And begin thy song again. Willy. Fain I would, but I do fear When again my lines they hear, If they yield they are my rhymes, They will fain some other crimes; And 'tis no safe vent'ring by Where we see detraction lie. For do what I can, I doubt She will pick some quarrel out; And I oft have heard defended, Little said is soon amended. Philarete. Seest thou not in clearest days Oft thick fogs cloud heaven's rays, And that vapours which do breathe From the earth's gross womb beneath, Seem not to us with black steams To pollute the sun's bright beams, And yet vanish into air, Leaving it unblemish'd fair? So, my Willy, shall it be With detraction's breath and thee. It shall never rise so high As to stain thy poesy. As that sun doth oft exhale Vapours from each rotten vale, Poesy so sometime drains Gross conceits from muddy brains, Mists of envy, fogs of spite, 'Twixt men's judgments and her light: But so much her power may do, That she can dissolve them too. If thy verse do bravely tower, As she makes wing, she gets power: Yet the higher she doth soar, She's affronted still the more: Till she to the high'st hath past, Then she rests with fame at last. Let nought therefore thee affright, But make forward in thy flight; For if I could match thy rhyme, To the very stars I'd climb, There begin again, and fly Till I reach'd eternity. But, alas, my Muse is slow; For thy pace she flags too low: Yea, the more's her hapless fate, Her short wings were clipp'd of late, And poor I, her fortune ruing, Am myself put up a-mewing. But if I my cage can rid, I'll fly where I never did. And though for her sake I'm crost, Though my best hopes I have lost, And knew she would make my trouble Ten times more than ten times double, I would love and keep her too Spite of all the world could do. For though banish'd from my flocks, And, confined within these rocks, Here I waste away the light And consume the sullen night, She doth for my comfort stay, And keeps many cares away. Though I miss the flow'ry fields, With those sweets the springtide yields, Though I may not see those groves, Where the shepherds chant their loves, And the lasses more excel Than the sweet-voiced Philomel, Though of all those pleasures past Nothing now remains at last, But remembrance, poor relief, That more makes than mends my grief; She's my mind's companion still, Maugre envy's evil will, Whence she should be driven too, Were 't in mortal's power to do. She doth tell me where to borrow Comfort in the midst of sorrow, Makes the desolatest place To her presence be a grace, And the blackest discontents To be pleasing ornaments. In my former days of bliss, Her divine skill taught me this, That from everything I saw I could some invention draw, And raise pleasure to her height, Through the meanest object's sight. By the murmur of a spring, Or the least bough's rusteling; By a daisy whose leaves spread Shut when Titan goes to bed, Or a shady bush or tree, She could more infuse in me Than all Nature's beauties can In some other wiser man. By her help I also now Make this churlish place allow Some things that may sweeten gladness In the very gall of sadness. The dull loneness, the black shade That these hanging vaults have made, The strange music of the waves Beating on these hollow caves, This black den which rocks emboss Overgrown with eldest moss, The rude portals that give light More to terror than delight, This my chamber of neglect, Wall'd about with disrespect; From all these and this dull air, A fit object for despair, She hath taught me by her might To draw comfort and delight. Therefore, thou best earthly bliss, I will cherish thee for this. Poesy, thou sweet'st content That e'er heav'n to mortals lent, Though they as a trifle leave thee Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee, Though thou be to them a scorn That to nought but earth are born, Let my life no longer be Than I am in love with thee. Though our wise ones call thee madness, Let me never taste of gladness If I love not thy mad'st fits, More than all their greatest wits. And though some too seeming holy Do account thy raptures folly, Thou dost teach me to contemn What makes knaves and fools of them Oh, high power! that oft doth carry Men aboveâ Willy. Good Philarete, tarry, I do fear thou wilt be gone Quite above my reach anon. The kind flames of poesy Have now borne thy thoughts so high, That they up in heaven be, And have quite forgotten me. Call thyself to mind again; Are these raptures for a swain That attends on lowly sheep, And with simple herds doth keep? Philarete. Thanks, my Willy; I had run Till that time had lodged the sun, If thou had'st not made me stay; But thy pardon here I pray. Loved Apollo's sacred sire Had raised up my spirits higher, Through the love of poesy, Than indeed they use to fly. But as I said, I say still, If that I had Willy's skill, Envy nor detraction's tongue Should e'er make me leave my song, But I'd sing it every day Till they pined themselves away. Be thou then advised in this Which both just and fitting is; Finish what thou hast begun, Or at least still forward run. Hail and thunder ill he'll bear That a blast of wind doth fear: And if words will thus affray thee, Prithee how will deeds dismay thee? Do not think so rathe a song Can pass through the vulgar throng, And escape without a touch, Or that they can hurt it much: Frosts we see do nip that thing Which is forward'st in the spring: Yet at last for all such lets Somewhat of the rest it gets. And I'm sure that so may'st thou. Therefore, my kind Willy, now, Since thy folding time draws on And I see thou must be gone, Thee I earnestly beseech To remember this my speech, And some little counsel take For Philarete his sake: And I more of this will say, If thou come next holiday. THE FIFTH ECLOGUE. Philaret Alexis moves To Master W. F. of the Middle Temple. The Argument. Philaret Alexis moves, To embrace the Muses' loves; Bids him never careful seem, Of another's disesteem; Since to them it may suffice, They themselves can justly prize. Philarete. Alexis. Philarete. Alexis, if thy worth do not disdain The humble friendship of a meaner swain, Or some more needful business of the day, Urge thee to be too hasty on thy way; Come, gentle shepherd, rest thee here by me, Beneath the shadow of this broad-leaved tree: For though I seem a stranger, yet mine eye Observes in thee the marks of courtesy, And if my judgment err not, noted too More than in those that more would seem to do; Such virtues thy rare modesty doth hide, Which by their proper lustre I espied; And though long mask'd in silence they have been, I have a wisdom through that silence seen, Yea, I have learned knowledge from thy tongue, And heard when thou hast in concealment sung, Which me the bolder and more willing made Thus to invite thee to this homely shade; And though it may be thou could'st never spy Such worth in me, I might be known thereby, In thee I do, for here my neighbouring sheep Upon the border of these downs I keep: Where often thou at pastorals and plays, Hast graced our wakes on summer holidays; And many a time with thee at this cold spring Met I, to hear your learned shepherds sing, Saw them disporting in the shady groves, And in chaste sonnets woo their chaster loves: When I, endued with the meanest skill, 'Mongst others have been urged to tune my quill. But, 'cause but little cunning I had got, Perhaps thou saw'st me, though thou knew'st me not. Alexis. Yes, Philaret, I know thee, and thy name. Nor is my knowledge grounded all on fame: Art thou not he that but this other year Scared'st all the wolves and foxes in the shire? And, in a match at football lately tried, Having scarce twenty satyrs on thy side, Held'st play, and though assailed kept'st thy stand 'Gainst all the best-tried ruffians in the land? Didst thou not then in doleful sonnets moan, When the beloved of great Pan was gone? And at the wedding of fair Thame and Rhine, Sing of their glories to thy valentine? I know it, and I must confess that long In one thing I did do thy nature wrong: For, till I mark'd the aim thy satyrs had, I thought them over-bold, and thee half mad. But since I did more nearly on thee look, I soon perceived that I had all mistook; I saw that of a cynic thou mad'st show, Where since I find that thou wert nothing so, And that of many thou much blame had'st got, Whenas thy innocence deserved it not. But that too good opinion thou hast seem'd To have of me, not so to be esteem'd, Prevails not ought to stay him who doth fear He rather should reproofs than praises hear. 'Tis true, I found thee plain and honest too, Which made me like, then love, as now I do; And, Phila, though a stranger, this I'll say, Where I do love, I am not coy to stay. Philarete. Thanks, gentle swain, that dost so soon unfold What I to thee as gladly would have told, And thus thy wonted courtesy exprest In kindly entertaining this request. Sure, I should injury my own content Or wrong thy love to stand on compliment, Who hast acquaintance in one word begun, As well as I could in an age have done. Or by an overweening slowness mar What thy more wisdom hath brought on so far. Then sit thou down, and I'll my mind declare, As freely as if we familiars were; And if thou wilt but deign to give me ear, Something thou may'st for thy more profit hear. Alexis. Philarete, I willingly obey. Philarete. Then know, Alexis, from that very day, Whenas I saw thee at that shepherd's cote, Where each I think of other took first note; I mean that pastor who by Tavy's springs Chaste shepherds' loves in sweetest numbers sings, And with his music, to his greater fame, Hath late made proud the fairest nymphs of Thame; E'en then, methought, I did espy in thee Some unperceived and hidden worth to be, Which in thy more apparent virtues shined; And, among many, I in thought divined, By something my conceit had understood, That thou wert mark'd one of the Muses' brood. That made me love thee, and that love I bear Begat a pity, and that pity, care: Pity I had to see good parts conceal'd, Care I had how to have that good reveal'd, Since 'tis a fault admitteth no excuse, To possess much, and yet put nought in use. Hereon I vow'd if we two ever met The first request that I would strive to get Should be but this, that thou would'st show thy skill, How thou could'st tune thy verses to thy quill, And teach thy Muse in some well-framed song, To show the art thou hast suppressed so long: Which if my new acquaintance may obtain, I will for ever honour this day's gain. Alexis. Alas! my small experience scarce can tell So much as where those nymphs the Muses dwell, Nor, though my slow conceit still travels on, Shall I e'er reach to drink of Helicon. Or, if I might so favour'd be to taste What those sweet streams but overflow in waste, And touch Parnassus, where it low'st doth lie, I fear my skill would hardly flag so high. Philarete. Despair not, man, the gods have prized nought So dear that may not be with labour bought: Nor need thy pain be great, since Fate and Heaven That, as a blessing, at thy birth have given. Alexis. Why, say they had? Philarete. Then use their gifts thou must, Or be ungrateful, and so be unjust: For if it cannot truly be denied, Ingratitude men's benefits do hide; Then more ungrateful must he be by odds, Who doth conceal the bounty of the gods. Alexis. That's true indeed, but Envy haunteth those Who, seeking fame, their hidden skill disclose, Where else they might, obscured from her espying, Escape the blasts and danger of envying. Critics will censure our best strains of wit, And purblind ignorance misconster it. All which is bad; yet worse than this doth follow, Most hate the Muses and contemn Apollo. Philarete. So let them: why should we their hate esteem? Is 't not enough we of ourselves can deem? 'Tis more to their disgrace that we scorn them, Than unto us that they our art contemn. Can we have better pastime than to see Their gross heads may so much deceived be As to allow those doings best, where wholly We scoff them to their face and flout their folly? Or to behold black Envy in her prime Die self-consumed, whilst we vie lives with time, And, in despite of her, more fame attain Than all her malice can wipe out again? Alexis. Yea, but if I applied me to those strains, Who should drive forth my flocks unto the plains, Which, whilst the Muses rest and leisure crave, Must watering, folding, and attendance have? For if I leave with wonted care to cherish Those tender herds, both I and they should perish. Philarete. Alexis, now I see thou dost mistake, There is no meaning thou thy charge forsake; Nor would I wish thee so thyself abuse As to neglect thy calling for thy Muse, But let these two so each of other borrow, That they may season mirth, and lessen sorrow. Thy flock will help thy charges to defray, Thy Muse to pass the long and tedious day: Or whilst thou tun'st sweet measures to thy reed, Thy sheep, to listen, will more near thee feed; The wolves will shun them, birds above thee sing, And lambkins dance about thee in a ring. Nay, which is more, in this thy low estate, Thou in contentment shalt with monarchs mate; For mighty Pan and Ceres to us grants, Our fields and flocks shall help our outward wants: The Muses teach us songs to put off cares, Graced with as rare and sweet conceits as theirs: And we can think our lasses on the greens As fair or fairer than the fairest queens: Or, what is more than most of them shall do, We'll make their juster fames last longer too, And have our lines by greatest princes graced When both their name and memory's defaced. Therefore, Alexis, though that some disdain The heavenly music of the rural plain, What is 't to us, if they o'erseen contemn The dainties which were ne'er ordain'd for them? And though that there be other-some envy The praises due to sacred Poesy, Let them disdain, and fret till they are weary, We in ourselves have that shall make us merry: Which he that wants, and had the power to know it, Would give his life that he might die a poet. Alexis. A brave persuasion. Philarete. Here thou seest me pent Within the jaws of strict imprisonment; A forlorn shepherd, void of all the means Whereon man's common hope in danger leans: Weak in myself, exposed to the hate Of those whose envies are insatiate: Shut from my friends, banish'd from all delights, Nay, worse, excluded from the sacred rites. Here I do live 'mongst outlaws mark'd for death, As one unfit to draw the common breath, Where those who to be good did never know Are barred from the means should make them so. I suffer, 'cause I wish'd my country well; And what I more must bear I cannot tell. I'm sure they give my body little scope, And would allow my mind as little hope: I waste my means, which of itself is slender, Consume my time, perhaps my fortunes hinder, And many crosses have, which those that can Conceive no wrong that hurts another man, Will not take note of; though if half so much Should light on them, or their own person touch, Some that themselves, I fear, most worthy think, With all their helps would into baseness shrink. But, spite of hate, and all that spite can do, I can be patient yet, and merry too. That slender Muse of mine, by which my name, Though scarce deserved, hath gain'd a little fame, Hath made me unto such a fortune born, That all misfortunes I know how to scorn, Yea, midst these bands can slight the great'st that be, As much as their disdain mis'steems of me. This cave, whose very presence some affrights, I have oft made to echo forth delights, And hope to turn, if any justice be, Both shame and care on those that wish'd it me. For while the world rank villainies affords, I will not spare to paint them out in words; Although I still should into troubles run, I knew what man could act, ere I begun; And I'll fulfil what my Muse draws me to, Maugre all jails, and purgatories too. For whilst she sets me honest tasks about, Virtue or she I know will bear me out: And if, by fate, th' abused power of some Must, in the world's-eye, leave me overcome, They shall find one fort yet so fenced, I trow, It cannot fear a mortal's overthrow. This hope and trust that great power did infuse, That first inspired into my breast a Muse, By whom I do, and ever will, contemn All these ill haps, my foes despite, and them. Alexis. Th' hast so well, young Philaret, played thy part, I am almost in love with that sweet art, And if some power will but inspire my song, Alexis will not be obscured long. Philarete. Enough, kind pastor: but oh! yonder see Two honest shepherds walking hither be; Cuddy and Willy, that so dearly love, Who are repairing unto yonder grove: Let's follow them, for never braver swains Made music to their flocks upon these plains. They are more worthy, and can better tell What rare contents do with a poet dwell. Then whiles our sheep the short sweet grass do shear, And till the long shade of the hills appear, We'll hear them sing, for though the one be young, Never was any that more sweetly sung. Fidelia An Elegiacal Epistle of FIDELIA to her unconstant friend. The Argument. This Elegiacal Epistle, being a fragment of some greater poem, discovers the modest affections of a discreet and constant woman, shadowed under the name of Fidelia; wherein you may perceive the height of their passions, so far as they seem to agree with reason, and keep within such decent bounds as beseemeth their sex; but further it meddles not. The occasion seems to proceed from some mutability in her friend, whose objections she here presupposing confuteth, and in the person of him justly upbraideth all that are subject to the like change or fickleness in mind. Among the rest, some more weighty arguments than are, perhaps, expected in such a subject, are briefly, and yet somewhat seriously handled. Oft I heard tell, and now for truth I find, Once out of sight, and quickly out of mind. And that it hath been rightly said of old, Love that's soon'st hot, is ever soonest cold. Or else my tears at this time had not stain'd The spotless paper, nor my lines complain'd. I had not now been forced to have sent These for the nuncios of my discontent, Or thus exchanged so unhappily My songs of mirth, to write an elegy. But now I must; and since I must do so, Let me but crave thou wilt not flout my woe, Nor entertain my sorrows with a scoff, But at least read them, ere thou cast them off. And, though thy heart's too hard to have compassion, If thou'lt not pity, do not blame my passion; For well thou know'st (alas, that e'er 'twas known) There was a time, although that time be gone, I, that for this scarce dare a beggar be, Presumed for more to have commanded thee. Yea, the day was (but see how things may change) When thou and I have not been half so strange, But oft embraced with a gentle greeting, And no worse words than âturtle-doveâ or âsweeting.â Yea, had thy meaning and those vows of thine Proved but as faithful and as true as mine, It still had been so; for (I do not feign) I should rejoice it might be so again. But, sith thy love grows cold, and thou unkind, Be not displeas'd I somewhat breathe my mind; I am in hope my words may prove a mirror, Whereon thou looking may'st behold thine error. And yet the heaven and my sad heart doth know How griev'd I am, and with what feeling woe My mind is tortured, to think that I Should be the brand of thy disloyalty, Or live to be the author of a line That shall be tainted with a fault of thine; Since if that thou but slightly touched be, Deep wounds of grief and shame it strikes in me; And yet I must; ill hap compels me to What I ne'er thought to have had cause to do. And therefore, seeing that some angry Fate Imposes on me what I so much hate, Or since it is so, that the powers divine Me miserable to such cares assign, Oh that Love's patron, or some sacred Muse, Amongst my passions would such art infuse, My well-framed words and airy sighs might prove The happy blasts to re-inflame thy love. Or at least touch thee with thy fault so near, That thou might'st see thou wrong'st who held thee dear, Seeing, confess the same, and so abhor it, Abhorring, pity, and repent thee for it. But, dear,âI hope that I may call thee so, For thou art dear to me, although a foeâ Tell me, is 't true that I do hear of thee, And by thy absence now so seems to be? Can such abuse be in thy court of Love, False and inconstant now, thou he should'st prove, He, that so woeful and so pensive sate Vowing his service at my feet of late? Art thou that quondam lover, whose sad eye I never saw yet in my presence dry, And from whose gentle-seeming tongue I know So many pity-moving words could flow? Was 't thou so soughtst my love, so seeking that As if it had been all th' hadst aimed at, Making me think thy passion without stain, And gently quite thee with my love again? With this persuasion I so fairly placed it, Nor Time nor Envy should have e'er defaced it. Is 't so? have I done thus much? and art thou So overcloyed with my favours now? Art wearied since with loving, and estranged So far? Is thy affection so much changed, That I of all my hopes must be deceived, And all good thoughts of thee be quite bereaved? Then I find true, which long before this day I fear'd myself, and heard some wiser say, That there is nought on earth so sweet that can Long relish with the curious taste of man. Happy was I; yea, well it was with me, Before I came to be bewitch'd by thee. I joy'd the sweet'st content that ever maid Possessed yet; and truly well-a-paid, Made to myself alone as pleasant mirth As ever any virgin did on earth. The melody I used was free, and such As that bird makes whom never hand did touch; But, unallured with fowlers' whistling, flies Above the reach of human treacheries. And, well I do remember, often then Could I read o'er the policies of men, Discover what uncertainties they were, How they would sigh, look sad, protest, and swear; Nay, feign to die, when they did never prove The slend'rest touch of a right worthy love, But had chilled hearts, whose dulness understood No more of passion than they did of good. All which I noted well, and in my mind, A general humour amongst womenkind, This vow I made, thinking to keep it than, That never the fair tongue of any man, Nor his complaint, though never so much grieved, Should move my heart to liking whilst I lived. But, who can say, what she shall live to do? I have believed, and let in liking too, And that so far, I cannot yet see how I may so much as hope to help it now; Which makes me think, whate'er we women say, Another mind will come another day; And that men may to things unhoped for climb, Who watch but opportunity and time. For 'tis well known we were not made of clay, Or such coarse and ill-temper'd stuff as they. For He that framed us of their flesh, did deign When 'twas at best, to new refine 't again. Which makes us ever since the kinder creatures, Of far more flexible and yielding natures. And as we oft excel in outward parts, So we have nobler and more gentle hearts; Which you well knowing, daily do devise How to imprint on them your cruelties. But do I find my cause thus bad indeed? Or else on things imaginary feed? Am I the lass that late so truly jolly Made myself merry oft, at others' folly? Am I the nymph that Cupid's fancies blamed, That was so cold, so hard to be inflamed? Am I myself? or is myself that she Who from this thraldom or such falsehoods free, Late own'd mine own heart, and full merry then, Did forewarn others to beware of men? And could not, having taught them what to do, Now learn myself to take heed of you too? Fool that I am, I fear my guerdon's just, In that I knew this, and presumed to trust. And yet, alas, for ought that I could tell, One spark of goodness in the world might dwell: And then I thought, if such a thing might be, Why might not that one spark remain in thee? For thy fair outside, and thy fairer tongue, Promised much, although thy years were young. And Virtue, wheresoever she be now, Seem'd then to sit enthroned upon thy brow. Yea, sure it was: but, whether 'twere or no, Certain I am, I was persuaded so: Which made me loth to think that words of fashion, Could be so framed, so overlaid with passion, Or sighs so feeling feign'd from any breast. Nay, say thou hadst been false in all the rest, Yet from thy eye, my heart such notice took, Methought, guile could not feign so sad a look. But now I've tried, my bought experience knows, They are oft worse that make the fairest shows. And howsoe'er men feign an outward grieving, 'Tis neither worth respecting, nor believing: For, she that doth one to her mercy take, Warms in her bosom but a frozen snake, Which, heated with her favours, gathers sense, And stings her to the heart in recompense. But tell me why, and for what secret spite You in poor women's miseries delight? For so it seems; else why d'ye labour for That which, when 'tis obtain'd, you do abhor? Or to what end do you endure such pain To win our love, and cast it off again? Oh! that we either your hard hearts could borrow, Or else your strengths, to help us bear our sorrow. But we are cause of all this grief and shame, And we have none but our own selves to blame: For still we see your falsehoods for our learning, Yet never can have power to take 't for warning; But, as if born to be deluded by you, We know you trustless, and yet still we try you. Alas, what wrong was in my power to do thee? Or what despite have I e'er done unto thee That thou shouldst choose me, above all the rest, To be thy scorn, and thus be made a jest? Must men's ill natures such true villains prove them, To make them only wrong those most that love them? Couldst thou find none in country, town, or court, But only me, to make thy fool, thy sport? Thou know'st I have no wanton courses run, Nor seemed easy unto lewdness won; And, though I cannot boast me of much wit, Thou saw'st no sign of fondness in me yet; Nor did ill nature ever so o'ersway me, To flout at any that did woo or pray me. But grant I had been guilty of abusage, Of thee I'm sure I ne'er deserved such usage. But thou wert grieved to behold my smilings, When I was free from love and thy beguilings, Or to what purpose else didst thou bestow Thy time and study to delude me so? Hast thou good parts? and dost thou bend them all To bring those that ne'er hated thee in thrall? Prithee take heed, although thou yet enjoy'st them, They'll be took from thee, if thou so employ'st them. For though I wish not the least harm to thee, I fear, the just heavens will revenged be. Oh! what of me by this time had become, If my desires with thine had happed to roam, Or I unwisely had consented to What, shameless, once thou didst attempt to do? I might have fall'n by those immodest tricks, Had not some power been stronger than my sex; And if I should have so been drawn to folly, I saw thee apt enough to be unholy; Or if my weakness had been prone to sin, I poorly by thy strength had succour'd bin. You men make us believe you do but try; And that's your part, you say; ours to deny. Yet I much fear, if we through frailty stray, There's few of you within your bounds will stay, But, maugre all your seeming virtue, be As ready to forget yourselves as we. I might have fear'd thy part of love not strong, When thou didst offer me so base a wrong; And that I after loath'd thee not, did prove In me some extra-ordinary love. For sure had any other but in thought Presum'd unworthily what thou hast sought, Might it appear, I should do thus much for him, With a scarce reconciled hate abhor him. My young experience never yet did know Whether desire might range so far, or no, To make true lovers carelessly request, What rash enjoying makes them most unblest, Or blindly thorough frailty give consenting To that, which done brings nothing but repenting. But in my judgment it doth rather prove That thou art fired with lust, than warm'd with love. And if it be for proof men so proceed, It shows a doubt; else what do trials need? And where is that man living ever knew That false distrust could be with love that's true? Since the mere cause of that unblamed effect, Such an opinion is, that hates suspect. And yet, I will thee and thy love excuse, If thou wilt neither me nor mine abuse. For I'll suppose thy passion made thee proffer That unto me thou to none else wouldst offer. And so, think thou, if I have thee denied, Whom I more loved than all men else beside, What hope have they such favours to obtain That never half so much respect could gain? Such was my love, that I did value thee Above all things below eternity. Nothing on earth unto my heart was nearer, No joy so prized, nor no jewel dearer. Nay, I do fear I did idolatrize; For which heaven's wrath inflicts these miseries, And makes the things which it for blessings sent, To be renewers of my discontent. Where was there any of the Naiades, The Dryads, or the Hamadryades? Which of the British shires can yield again A mistress of the springs, or wood, or plain? Whose eye enjoyed more sweet contents than mine, Till I received my overthrow by thine? Where's she did more delight in springs and rills? Where's she that walk'd more groves, or downs, or hills? Or could by such fair artless prospects, more Add by conceit to her contentment's store Than I, whilst thou wert true, and with thy graces Didst give a pleasing presence to those places? But now what is, what was hath overthrown, My rose-deck'd alleys now with rue are strown; And from those flowers that honeyed use to be, I suck nought now but juice to poison me. For ev'n as she, whose gentle spirit can rise To apprehend Love's noble mysteries, Spying a precious jewel richly set Shine in some corner of her cabinet, Taketh delight at first to gaze upon The pretty lustre of the sparkling stone, And pleased in mind, by that doth seem to see How virtue shines through base obscurity, But prying nearer, seeing it doth prove Some relic of her dear deceased love, Which to her sad remembrance doth lay ope What she most sought and sees most far from hope, Fainting almost beneath her passion's weight, And quite forgetful of her first conceit, Looking upon 't again, from thence she borrows Sad melancholy thoughts to feed her sorrows: So I, beholding Nature's curious bowers, Ciel'd, strow'd, and trimm'd up with leaves, herbs, and flowers, Walk pleased on a while, and do devise How on each object I may moralize. But ere I pace on many steps, I see There stands a hawthorn that was trimm'd by thee: Here thou didst once slip off the virgin sprays To crown me with a wreath of living bays. On such a bank I see how thou didst lie, When, viewing of a shady mulberry, The hard mishap thou didst to me discuss Of loving Thisbe and young Pyramus: And oh, think I, how pleasing was it then, Or would be yet, might he return again. But if some neighbouring row do draw me to Those arbours, where the shadows seem to woo The weary lovesick passenger to sit And view the beauties Nature strows on it; How fair, think I, would this sweet place appear If he I love were sporting with me here! Nay, every several object that I see Doth severally, methinks, remember thee. But the delight I used from it to gather, I now exchange for cares, and seek them rather. But those whose dull and gross affections can Extend but only to desire a man, Cannot the depth of these rare passions know, For their imaginations flag too low. And 'cause their base conceits do apprehend Nothing but that whereto the flesh doth tend; In Love's embraces they ne'er reach unto More of content than the brute creatures do. Neither can any judge of this, but such Whose braver minds for braver thoughts do touch And having spirits of a nobler frame, Feel the true heat of Love's unquenched flame; They may conceive aright what smarting sting To their remembrances the place will bring, Where they did once enjoy, and then do miss, What to their souls most dear and precious is. With me 'tis so; for those walks that once seem'd Pleasing, when I of thee was more esteem'd, To me appear most desolate and lonely, And are the places now of torment only. Where I the highest of contents did borrow, There am I paid it home with treble sorrow. Unto one place, I do remember well, We walk'd the evenings to hear Philomel; And that seems now to want the light it had; The shadow of the grove's more dull and sad, As if it were a place but fit for fowls That screech ill-luck; as melancholy owls, Or fatal ravens that, seld boding good, Croak their black auguries from some dark wood. Then if from thence I half-despairing go, Another place begins another woe: For thus unto my thought it seems to say, âHither thou saw'st him riding once that way Thither to meet him thou didst nimbly haste thee, Yond he alighted, and ev'n there embraced thee:â Which whilst I sighing wish to do again, Another object brings another pain. For passing by that green, which, could it speak, Would tell it saw us run at barley-break, There I beheld what on a thin-rind tree Thou hadst engraven for the love of me, When we two all alone in heat of day With chaste embraces drave swift hours away. Then I remember too, unto my smart, How loth we were when time compell'd to part; How cunningly thy passions thou couldst feign In taking leave, and coming back again So oft, until, as seeming to forget We were departing, down again we set, And freshly in that sweet discourse went on, Which now I almost faint to think upon. Viewing again those other walks and groves That have been witnesses of our chaste loves, When I beheld those trees whose tender skin Hath that cut out which still cuts me within, Or come, by chance, unto that pretty rill Where thou wouldst sit, and teach the neighbouring hill To answer, in an echo, unto those Rare problems which thou often didst propose; When I come there, think I, if these could take That use of words and speech which we partake, They might unfold a thousand pleasures then Which I shall never live to taste again. And thereupon, remembrance doth so rack My thoughts, with representing what I lack, That in my mind those clerks do argue well, Which hold privation the great'st plague of hell. For there's no torment gripes me half so bad, As the remembrance of those joys I had. Oh, hast thou quite forgot, when sitting by The banks of Thame, beholding how the fry Play'd on the silver-wavesâthere where I first Granted to make my fortune thus accurst; There where thy too-too earnest suit compelled My over-soon believing heart to yield One favour first, which then another drew To get another, till, alas, I rue That day and hour, thinking I ne'er should need, As now, to grieve for doing such a deed: So freely I my courtesies bestow'd, That whose I was unwarily I show'd, And to my heart such passage made for thee Thou canst not to this day removed be; And what breast could resist it, having seen How true thy love had in appearance been? For, I shall ne'er forget, when thou hadst there Laid open every discontent and care Wherewith thou deeply seem'dst to me opprest When thou, as much as any could protest, Hadst vow'd and sworn, and yet perceived'st no sign Of pity moving in this breast of mine, âWell, love,â said'st thou, âsince neither sigh nor vow, Nor any service may prevail me now: Since neither the recital of my smart, Nor those strong passions that assail my heart, Nor anything may move thee to belief Of these my sufferings, or to grant relief; Since there's no comfort, nor desert, that may Get me so much as hope of what I pray; Sweet love, farewell; farewell, fair beauty's light, And every pleasing object of the sight; My poor despairing heart here biddeth you And all content for evermore adieu.â Then ev'n as thou seem'dst ready to depart, Reaching that hand, which after gave my heart, And thinking this sad âFarewellâ did proceed From a sound breast, but truly moved indeed, I stayed thy departing from me so, Whilst I stood mute with sorrow, thou for show. And the meanwhile, as I beheld thy look, My eye the impression of such pity took, That, with the strength of passion overcome, A deep-fetch'd sigh my heart came breathing from: Whereat thou, ever wisely using this To take advantage when it offered is, Renew'dst thy suit to me, who did afford Consent, in silence first, and then in word. So for that yielding thou may'st thank thy wit; And yet whenever I remember it, Trust me, I muse, and often, wond'ring, think Thorough what cranny or what secret chink That love, unwares, so like a sly close elf, Did to my heart insinuate itself. Gallants I had, before thou cam'st to woo, Could as much love, and as well court me too; And, though they had not learned so the fashion Of acting such well-counterfeited passion, In wit and person they did equal thee, And worthier seem'd, unless thou'lt faithful be. Yet still unmov'd, unconquer'd I remained; No, not one thought of love was entertained; Nor could they brag of the least favour to them, Save what mere courtesy enjoin'd to do them. Hard was my heart, but would 't had harder bin, And then, perhaps, I had not let thee in; Thou, tyrant, that art so imperious there, And only tak'st delight to domineer. But held I out such strong, such oft assailing, And ever kept the honour of prevailing? Was this poor breast from love's allurings free? Cruel to all and gentle unto thee? Did I unlock that strong affection's door, That never could be broken ope before, Only to thee? and, at thy intercession, So freely give up all my heart's possession, That to myself I left not one poor vein, Nor power, nor will, to put thee from 't again? Did I do this? and all on thy bare vow? And wilt thou thus requite my kindness now? Oh, that thou either hadst not learn'd to feign, Or I had power to cast thee off again! How is it that thou art become so rude And over-blinded by ingratitude? Swar'st thou so deeply that thou wouldst persever, That I might thus be cast away for ever? Well, then 'tis true, that lovers' perjuries Among some men are thought no injuries, And that she only hath least cause of grief Who of your words hath small'st, or no belief. Had I the wooer been, or fondly woon, This had been more though than thou couldst have done; But, neither being so, what reason is On thy side that should make thee offer this? I know, had I been false, or my faith fail'd, Thou wouldst at women's fickleness have rail'd; And if in me it had an error bin, In thee shall the same fault be thought no sin? Rather I hold that which is bad in me Will be a greater blemish unto thee, Because by Nature thou art made more strong, And therefore abler to endure a wrong. But 'tis our fortune, you'll have all the power, Only the care and burden must be our. Nor can you be content a wrong to do, Unless you lay the blame upon us too. Oh, that there were some gentle-minded poet That knew my heart, as well as now I know it, And would endear me to his love so much, To give the world though but a slender touch Of that sad passion which now clogs my heart, And show my truth and thee how false thou art, That all might know, what is believed by no man, There's fickleness in men and faith in woman. Thou saw'st I first let pity in, then liking, And lastly, that which was thy only seeking: And, when I might have scorn'd that love of thine, As now ungently thou despisest mine, Among the inmost angles of my breast, To lodge it by my heart I thought it best: Which thou hast stol'n too, like a thankless mate, And left me nothing but a black self-hate. What canst thou say for this, to stand contending? What colour hast thou left for thy offending? That wit, perhaps, hath some excuse in store, Or an evasion to escape a sore. But well I know, if thou excuse this treason, It must be by some greater thing than reason. Are any of those virtues yet defaced, On which thy first affection seemed placed? Hath any secret foe my true faith wronged, To rob the bliss that to my heart belonged? What then? shall I condemned be unheard Before thou knowest how I may be clear'd? Thou art acquainted with the times' condition, Know'st it is full of envy and suspicion, So that the wariest in thought, word, and action, Shall be most injured by foul-mouth'd detraction: And therefore thou, methinks, shouldst wisely pause Before thou credit rumours without cause. But I have gotten such a confidence In thy opinion of my innocence, It is not that, I know, withholds thee now; Sweet, tell me then, is it some sacred vow? Hast thou resolved not to join thy hand With any one in Hymen's holy band? Thou shouldst have done it then, when thou wert free, Before thou hadst bequeath'd thyself to me. What vow dost deem more pleasing unto heaven Than what is by unfeigned lovers given? If any be, yet sure it frowneth at Those that are made for contradicting that. But, if thou wouldst live chastely all thy life, That thou may'st do, though we be man and wife; Or, if thou long'st a virgin death to die, Why, if it be thy pleasure, so do I. Make me but thine, and I'll contented be A virgin still, yet live and lie with thee. Then let not thy inventing brain essay To mock, and still delude me every way, But call to mind how thou hast deeply sworn Not to neglect nor leave me thus forlorn. And if thou wilt not be to me as when We first did love, do but come see me then; Vouchsafe that I may sometime with thee walk, Or sit and look on thee or hear thee talk; And I that most content once aimed at Will think there is a world of bliss in that. Dost thou suppose that my desire denies With thy affections well to sympathize? Or such perverseness hast thou found in me, May make our natures disagreeing be? Thou know'st when thou didst wake I could not sleep, And if thou wert but sad, that I should weep. Yet, even when the tears my cheek did stain, If thou didst smile, why I could smile again. I never did contrary thee in ought; Nay, thou canst tell, I oft have spake thy thought. Waking, the self-same course with thee I run, And sleeping, oftentimes our dreams were one. The dial-needle, though it sense doth want, Still bends to the beloved adamant; Lift the one up, the other upward tends; If this fall down, that presently descends: Turn but about the stone, the steel turns too; Then straight returns, if but the other do; And, if it stay, with trembling keeps one place, As if it, panting, long'd for an embrace. So was 't with me: for, if thou merry wert, That mirth of thine moved joy within my heart: I sighed too, when thou didst sigh or frown; When thou wert sick, thou hast perceived me swoun; And being sad have oft, with forced delight, Striv'd to give thee content beyond my might. When thou wouldst talk, then have I talk'd with thee, And silent been when thou wouldst silent be. If thou abroad didst go, with joy I went; If home thou lov'dst, at home was my content: Yea, what did to my nature disagree I could make pleasing, 'cause it pleased thee. But, if 't be either my weak sex, or youth, Makes thee misdoubt my undistained truth, Know this; as none, till that unhappy hour When I was first made thine, had ever power To move my heart by vows, or tears' expense, No more, I swear, could any creature since. No looks but thine, though aim'd with passion's art, Could pierce so deep to penetrate my heart. No name but thine was welcome to my ear; No word did I so soon so gladly hear: Nor ever could my eyes behold or see, What I was since delighted in, but thee. And sure thou wouldst believe it to be so If I could tell, or words might make thee know, How many a weary night my tumbled bed Hath known me sleepless, what salt tears I've shed; What scalding sighs, the marks of souls opprest, Have hourly breathed from my careful breast. Nor wouldst thou deem those waking sorrows feign'd, If thou might'st see how sleeping I am pain'd. For if sometimes I chance to take a slumber, Unwelcome dreams my broken rest doth cumber; Which dreaming makes me start, starting with fears Wakes; and so waking I renew my cares, Until my eyes o'er-tired with watch and weeping, Drown'd in their own floods fall again to sleeping. Oh! that thou couldst but think, when last we parted, How much I, grieving for thy absence, smarted: My very soul fell sick, my heart to aching, As if they had their last farewells been taking, Or feared by some secret divination This thy revolt and causeless alteration. Didst thou not feel how loth that hand of mine Was to let go the hold it had of thine? And with what heavy, what unwilling look I leave of thee, and then of comfort took? I know thou didst; and though now thus thou do, I am deceived but then it grieved thee too. Then if I so with love's fell passion vext For thy departure only was perplext, When I had left to strengthen me some trust, And hope that thou wouldst ne'er have proved unjust, What was my torture then and hard endurance When of thy falsehood I received assurance? Alas, my tongue awhile with grief was dumb, And a cold shuddering did my joints benumb, Amazement seized my thought, and so prevailed, I found me ill, but knew not what I ailed. Nor can I yet tell, since my suffering then Was more than could be shown by poet's pen, Or well conceived by any other heart Than that which in such care hath borne a part. Oh me, how loth was I to have believed That to be true, for which so much I grieved? How gladly would I have persuaded bin There had been no such matter, no such sin. I would have had my heart think that I knew To be the very truth, not to be true. Why may not this, thought I, some vision be, Some sleeping dream or waking phantasy Begotten by my over-blinded folly, Or else engendered through my melancholy? But finding it so real, thought I then, Must I be cast from all my hopes again? What are become of all those fading blisses, Which late my hope had, and now so much misses? Where is that future fickle happiness Which I so long expected to possess? And, thought I too, where are his dying passions, His honeyed words, his bitter lamentations? To what end were his sonnets, epigrams, His pretty posies, witty anagrams? I could not think all that might have been feign'd, Nor any faith I thought so firm been stain'd. Nay, I do sure and confidently know It is not possible it should be so, If that rare art and passion was thine own Which in my presence thou hast often shown. But, since thy change, my much-presaging heart Is half afraid thou some impostor wert; Or that thou didst but, player-like addrest, Act that which flow'd from some more gentle breast. Thy puffed invention, with worse matter swollen, Those thy conceits from better wits hath stolen: Or else I know it could not be that thou Shouldst be so over-cold as thou art now; Since those, who have that feelingly their own, Ever possess more worth conceal'd than known. And if Love ever any mortals touch, To make a brave impression, 'tis in such, Who, sworn love's chaplains, will not violate That whereunto themselves they consecrate. But oh, you noble brood, on whom the world The slighted burthen of neglect hath hurl'd, Because your thoughts, for higher objects born, Their grovelling humours and affection scorn, You, whom the gods, to hear your strains, will follow, Whilst you do court the sisters of Apollo, You, whom there's none that's worthy can neglect, Or any that unworthy is affect; Do not let those that seek to do you shame Bewitch us with those songs they cannot frame: The noblest of our sex, and fairest too, Do ever love and honour such as you. Then wrong us not so much to give your passion To those that have it but in imitation, And in their dull breasts never feel the power Of such deep thoughts as sweetly move in your. As well as you, they us thereby abuse, For, many times, when we our lovers choose, Where we think Nature that rich jewel sets Which shines in you, we light on counterfeits. But see, see whither discontentment bears me, And to what uncouth strains my passion rears me: Yet, pardon me, I here again repent If I have erred through that discontent. Be what thou wilt, be counterfeit or right, Be constant, serious, or be vain, or light, My love remains inviolate the same: Thou canst be nothing that can quench this flame, But it will burn as long as thou hast breath To keep it kindled, if not after death. Ne'er was there one more true than I to thee, And though my faith must now despised be, Unpriz'd, unvalued at the lowest rate, Yet this I'll tell thee; 'tis not all thy state, Nor all that better-seeming worth of thine, Can buy thee such another love as mine: Liking it may, but oh, there's as much odds, 'Twixt love and that, as between men and gods, And 'tis a purchase not procured with treasure, As some fools think, nor to be gain'd at pleasure; For were it so, and any could assure it, What would not some men part with to procure it? But though thou weigh 't not as thou ought'st to do, Thou know'st I love, and once didst love me too. Then where's the cause of this dislike in thee? Survey thyself, I hope there's none in me. Yet look on her from whom thou art estranged; See, is my person or my beauty changed? Once thou didst praise it, prithee view 't again, And mark if 't be not still the same 'twas then. No false vermilion dye my cheek distains, 'Tis the poor blood dispersed through pores and veins, Which thou hast oft seen through my forehead flushing, To show no dauby colour hid my blushing, Nor never shall; Virtue, I hope, will save me, Contented with that beauty Nature gave me. Or, if 't seem less, for that grief's veil hath hid it, Thou threw'st it on me, 'twas not I that did it, And canst again restore what may repair All that's decay'd, and make me far more fair. Which if thou do, I'll be more wary than, To keep 't for thee unblemish'd, what I can; And 'cause at best 'twill want much of perfection, The rest shall be supplied with true affection. But I do fear it is some other's riches, Whose more abundance that thy mind bewitches; So that base object, that too general aim, Makes thee my lesser fortune to disclaim. Fie, canst thou so degenerate in spirit, As to prefer the means before the merit? Although I cannot say it is in me, Such worth sometimes with poverty may be To equalize the match she takes upon her, Tho' th' other vaunt of birth, wealth, beauty, honour: And many a one that did for greatness wed, Would gladly change it for a meaner bed. Yet are my fortunes known indifferent, Not basely mean, but such as may content; And though I yield the better to be thine, I may be bold to say thus much for mine; That if thou couldst of them and me esteem, Neither thy state nor birth would misbeseem; Or if it did, how can I help 't, alas, Thou, not alone, before knew'st what it was. But I, although not fearing so to speed, Did also disenable 't more than need, And yet thou woo'dst, and wooing didst persever As if thou hadst intended love for ever: Yea, thy account of wealth thou mad'st so small, Thou hadst not any question of 't at all; But hating much that peasant-like condition, Didst seem displeas'd I held it in suspicion. Whereby I think, if nothing else do thwart us, It cannot be the want of that will part us. Yea, I do rather doubt indeed, that this The needless fear of friends' displeasure is. That is the bar which stops out my delight, And all my hope and joy confoundeth quite. But bears there any in thy heart such sway To shut me thence, and wipe thy love away? Can there be any friend that hath the power To disunite hearts so conjoin'd as our? Ere I would have so done by thee, I'd rather Have parted with one dearer than my father. For though the will of our Creator binds Each child to learn and know his parents' minds, Yet sure I am so just a Deity Commandeth nothing against piety; Nor doth that band of duty give them leave To violate their faith or to deceive. And though that parents have authority To rule their children in minority, Yet they are never granted such power on them That will allow to tyrannize upon them, Or use them under their command so ill, To force them, without reason, to their will. For who hath read in all the Sacred Writ Of any one compell'd to marriage yet? What father so unkind, thereto required, Denied his child the match that he desired, So that he found the laws did not forbid it? I think those gentler ages no men did it. In those days therefore for them to have bin Contracted without licence had been sin, Since there was more good-nature among men, And every one more truly loving then. But now, although we stand obliged still To labour for their liking and good-will, There is no duty whereby they may tie us From ought which without reason they deny us: For I do think it is not only meant Children should ask, but parents should consent; And that they err, their duty as much breaking For not consenting as we not for speaking: âIt is no marvel many matches be Concluded now without their privity; Since they, through greedy avarice misled, Their interest in that have forfeited.â For some, respectless of all care, do marry Hot youthful May to cold old January. Some, for a greedy end, do basely tie The sweetest fair to foul deformity, Forcing a love from where 'twas placed late, To re-ingraff it where it turns to hate. It seems no cause of hindrance in their eyes Though manners nor affections sympathize; And two religions by their rules of state They may in one made body tolerate, As if they did desire that double stem Should fruitful bear but neuters like to them. Alas, how many numbers of both kinds, By that, have ever discontented minds, And live, though seeming unto others well, In the next torments unto those of hell? How many, desperate grown by this their sin, Have both undone themselves and all their kin? Many a one, we see, it makes to fall With the too-late repenting prodigal. Thousands, though else by Nature gentler given, To act the horrid'st murthers oft are driven; And, which is worse, there's many a careless elf, Unless heaven pity, kills and damns himself. Oh, what hard heart, or what unpitying eyes, Could hold from tears to see those tragedies, Parents, by their neglect in this, have hurl'd Upon the stage of this respectless world? 'Tis not one man, one family, one kin, No, nor one country that hath ruin'd bin By such their folly, which the cause hath proved That foreign, oft, and civil wars were moved. By such beginnings many a city lies Now in the dust, whose turrets braved the skies: And divers monarchs by such fortunes crost, Have seen their kingdoms fired, and spoil'd, and lost. Yet all this while, thou seest, I mention not The ruin shame and chastity hath got; For 'tis a task too infinite to tell How many thousands that would have done well, Do, by the means of this, suffer desires To kindle in their hearts unlawful fires: Nay, some, in whose cold breast ne'er flame had bin, Have only for mere vengeance fall'n to sin. Myself have seen, and my heart bled to see 't, A witless clown enjoy a match unmeet. She was a lass that had a look to move The heart of cold Diogenes to love: Her eye was such, whose every glance did know To kindle flames upon the hills of snow; And by her powerful piercings could imprint Or sparkle fire into a heart of flint: And yet, unless I much deceived be, In very thought did hate immodesty. And, had sh' enjoy'd the man she could have loved, Might to this day have lived unreproved: But being forced, perforce, by seeming friends, With her consent she her contentment ends, In that, compell'd, herself to him she gave, Whose bed she rather could have wish'd her grave; And since I hear, what I much fear is true, That she hath bidden shame and fame adieu. Such are the causes now that parents quite Are put beside much of their ancient right; The fear of this makes children to withhold From giving them those dues which else they would; And these thou seest are the too-fruitful ills Which daily spring from their unbridled wills. Yet they, forsooth, will have it understood, That all their study is their children's good. A seeming love shall cover all they do, When, if the matter were well look'd into, Their careful reach is chiefly to fulfil Their own foul, greedy, and insatiate will: Who, quite forgetting they were ever young, Would have their children dote, with them, on dung. Grant, betwixt two there be true love, content, Birth not mis-seeming, wealth sufficient, Equality in years, an honest fame, In every side the person without blame, And they obedient too, what can you gather Of Love, or of affection, in that father That, but a little to augment his treasure, Perhaps no more but only for his pleasure, Shall force his child to one he doth abhor, From her he loves and justly seeketh for; Compelling him, for such misfortune grieved, To die with care, that might with joy have lived? This you may say is Love, and swear as well There's pains in Heaven and delights in Hell; Or, that the devil's fury and austerity Proceeds out of his care of our prosperity. Would parents, in this age, have us begin To take by their eyes our affections in? Or do they think we bear them in our fist, That we may still remove them as they list? It is impossible it should be thus, For we are ruled by love, not love by us: And so our power so much ne'er reacheth to, To know where we shall love, until we do. And when it comes, hide it awhile we may, But it is not in our strengths to drive 't away. Either mine own eye should my chooser be, Or I would ne'er wear Hymen's livery. For who is he so near my heart doth rest, To know what 'tis that mine approveth best? I have myself beheld those men, whose frame And outward personages had nought of blame; They had, what might their good proportion grace, The much more moving part, a comely face, With many of those complements, which we In common men of the best breeding see; They had discourse, and wit enough to carry Themselves in fashion at an ordinary; Gallants they were, loved company and sport, Wore favours, and had mistresses in court; And every way were such that they might seem Worthy of note, respect, and such esteem; Yet hath my eye more cause of liking seen Where nought perhaps by some hath noted been: And I have there found more content by far Where some of these perfections wanting are; Yea, so much that their beauties were a blot To them, methought, because he had them not. There some peculiar thing innated is, That bears an uncontrolled sway in this; And nothing but itself knows how to fit The mind with that which best shall suit with it. Then why should parents thrust themselves into What they want warrant for, and power to do? How is it they are so forgetful grown Of those conditions that were once their own? Do they so dote amidst their wits' perfection, To think that age and youth hath like affection, When they do see 'mong those of equal years, One hateth what another most endears? Or do they think their wisdoms can invent A thing to give that's greater than content? No, neither shall they wrap us in such blindness, To make us think the spite they do a kindness. For as I would advise no child to stray From the least duty that he ought to pay, So would I also have him wisely know How much that duty is which he doth owe; That, knowing what doth unto both belong, He may do them their right, himself no wrong. For if my parents him I loathe should choose, 'Tis lawful, yea, my duty, to refuse; Else how shall I lead so upright a life As is enjoined to the man and wife? Since that we see sometime there are repentings, Ev'n where there are the most and best contentings. What, though that by our parents first we live, Is not life misery enough to give? Which at their births the children doth undo, Unless they add some other mischief too. 'Cause they gave being to this flesh of our, Must we be therefore slaves unto their power? We ne'er desired it, for how could we tell, Not being, but that not-to-be was well? Nor know they whom they profit by it, seeing Happy were some, if they had had no being. Indeed, had they produced us without sin, Had all our duty to have pleased them bin? Of the next life could they assure the state, And both beget us and regenerate, There were no reason then we should withstand To undergo their tyrannous't command, In hope that either for our hard endurance, We should, at last, have comfort in assurance; Or, if in our endeavours we mis-sped, At least feel nothing when we should be dead. But what's the reason for 't that we shall be Enthrall'd so much unto mortality, Our souls on will of any men to tie Unto an everlasting misery? So far, perhaps too, from the good of either, We ruin them, ourselves, and all together. Children owe much, I must confess 'tis true, And a great debt is to the parents due: Yet if they have not so much power to crave But in their own defence the lives they gave, How much less then should they become so cruel As to take from them the high-prized jewel Of liberty in choice, whereon depends The main contentment that the heaven here lends? Worth life or wealth, nay, far more worth than either, Or twenty thousand lives put all together. Then howsoever some, severer bent, May deem of my opinion or intent, With that which follows thus conclude I do, And I have reason for 't, and conscience too: No parent may his child's just suit deny On his bare will, without a reason why; Nor he so used be disobedient thought, If unapproved he take the match he sought. So then if that thy faith uncrazed be, Thy friends' dislike shall be no stop to me; For, if their will be not of force to do it, They shall have no cause else to drive them to it. Let them bring all forth that they can allege; We are both young and of the fittest age, If thou dissembledst not, both love, and both To admit hindrance in our loves were loth. 'Tis prejudicial unto none that lives; And God's and human law our warrant gives; Nor are we much unequal in degree; Perhaps our fortunes somewhat different be, But say that little means, which is, were not, The want of wealth may not dissolve this knot. For though some such preposterous courses wend, Prescribing to themselves no other end, Marriage was not ordained t'enrich men by, Unless it were in their posterity; And he that doth for other causes wed Ne'er knows the true sweets of a marriage bed: Nor shall he, by my will, for 'tis unfit He should have bliss that never aim'd at it. Though that bewitching gold the rabble blinds, And is the object of the vulgar minds; Yet those, methinks, that graced seem to be With so much good as doth appear in thee, Should scorn their better taught desires to tie To that which fools do get their honour by. I can like of the wealth, I must confess, Yet more I prize the man, though moneyless. I am not of their humour yet that can For title or estate affect a man; Or of myself one body deign to make With him I loathe, for his possessions' sake. Nor wish I ever to have that mind bred In me, that is in those who, when they wed, Think it enough they do attain the grace Of some new honour, to fare well, take place, Wear costly clothes, in others' sights agree, Or happy in opinion seem to be. I weigh not this: for were I sure before Of Spencer's wealth, or our rich Sutton's store; Had I therewith a man whom Nature lent Person enough to give the eye content; If I no outward due nor right did want, Which the best husbands in appearance grant; Nay, though alone we had no private jars, But merry lived from all domestic cares; Unless I thought his nature so incline That it might also sympathize with mine, And yield such correspondence with my mind, Our souls might mutually contentment find, By adding unto these which went before Some certain unexpressed pleasures more, Such as exceed the straight and curb'd dimensions Of common minds and vulgar apprehensions, I would not care for such a match, but tarry In this estate I am, and never marry. Such were the sweets I hoped to have possest, When fortune should with thee have made me blest. My heart could hardly think of that content To apprehend it without ravishment. Each word of thine, methought, was to my ears More pleasing than that music which the spheres, They say, do make the gods, when in their chime Their motions diapason with the time. In my conceit the opening of thine eye Seem'd to give light to every object by, And shed a kind of life unto my shew, On everything that was within it view. More joy I've felt to have thee but in place Than many do in the most close embrace Of their beloved'st friend, which well doth prove Not to thy body only tends my love; But, mounting a true height, grows so divine, It makes my soul to fall in love with thine. And sure now, whatsoe'er thy body do, Thy soul loves mine, and oft they visit too. For late I dreamed they went I know not whither, Unless to heaven, and there play'd together; And to this day I ne'er could know or see 'Twixt them or us the least antipathy. Then what should make thee keep thy person hence, Or leave to love, or hold it in suspense? If to offend thee I unwares was driven, Is 't such a fault as may not be forgiven? Or if by frowns of fate I have been checked, So that I seem not worth thy first respect, Shall I be therefore blamed and upbraided With what could not be holpen or avoided? 'Tis not my fault, yet 'cause my fortunes do Wilt thou be so unkind to wrong me too? Not unto thine, but thee, I set my heart, So nought can wipe my love out while thou art: Though thou wert poorer both of house and meat Than he that knows not where to sleep or eat; Though thou wert sunk into obscurity, Become an abject in the world's proud eye; Though by perverseness of thy fortune crost Thou wert deformed, or some limb hadst lost, That love which admiration first begot, Pity would strengthen, that it failed not; Yea, I should love thee still, and without blame, As long as thou couldst keep thy mind the same, Which is of virtues so compact, I take it, No mortal change shall have the power to shake it. This may, and will, I know, seem strange to those That cannot the abyss of love disclose, Nor must they think, whom but the outside moves, Ever to apprehend such noble loves, Or more conjecture their unfounded measure Than can we mortals of immortal pleasure. Then let not those dull unconceiving brains, Who shall hereafter come to read these strains, Suppose that no love's fire can be so great Because it gives not their cold clime such heat, Or think m' invention could have reached here Unto such thoughts, unless such love there were; For then they shall but show their knowledge weak, And injure me that feel of what I speak. But now my lines grow tedious, like my wrong, And as I thought that, thou think'st this too long. Or some may deem I thrust myself into More than beseemeth modesty to do. But of the difference I am not unwitting, Betwixt a peevish coyness and things unfitting; Nothing respect I who pries o'er my doing, For here's no vain allurements nor fond wooing, To train some wanton stranger to my lure, But with a thought that's honest, chaste, and pure, I make my cause unto thy conscience known, Suing for that which is by right my own. In which complaint, if thou do hap to find Any such word as seems to be unkind, Mistake me not, it but from passion sprung, And not from an intent to do thee wrong. Or if among these doubts my sad thoughts breed, Some, peradventure, may be more than need, They are to let thee know, might we dispute, There's no objections but I could refute; And spite of envy such defences make, Thou shouldst embrace that love thou dost forsake. Then do not, oh, forgetful man, now deem That 'tis ought less than I have made it seem; Or that I am unto this passion moved, Because I cannot elsewhere be beloved; Or that it is thy state whose greatness known Makes me become a suitor for my own. Suppose not so; for know this day there be Some that woo hard for what I offer thee; And I have ever yet contented bin With that estate I first was placed in. Banish those thoughts and turn thee to my heart; Come once again and be what once thou wert. Revive me by those wonted joys repairing, That am nigh dead with sorrows and despairing: So shall the memory of this annoy, But add more sweetness to my future joy; Yea, make me think thou meant'st not to deny me, But only wert estranged thus, to try me. And lastly, for that love's sake thou once bar'st me, By that right hand thou gav'st, that oath thou swar'st me, By all the passions, and, if any be, For her dear sake that makes thee injure me, I here conjure theeâno, entreat and sue, That if these lines do overreach thy view, Thou wouldst afford me so much favour for them As to accept, or at least not abhor them. So though thou wholly cloak not thy disdain, I shall have somewhat the less cause to plain: Or if thou needs must scoff at this, or me, Do 't by thyself, that none may witness be. Not that I fear 'twill bring me any blame, Only I'm loth the world should know thy shame. For all that shall this plaint with reason view Will judge me faithful, and thee most untrue. But if oblivion, that thy love bereft, Hath not so much good-nature in thee left But that thou must, as most of you men do When you have conquer'd, tyrannize it too, Know this before, that it is praise to no man To wrong so frail a creature as a woman, And to insult o'er one so much made thine, Will more be thy disparagement than mine. But ohâI pray that it portend no harmsâ A cheering heat my chilled senses warms: Just now I flashing feel into my breast A sudden comfort, not to be exprest, Which, to my thinking, doth again begin To warm my heart, to let some hope come in; It tells me 'tis impossible that thou Shouldst live not to be mine; it whispers how My former fears and doubts have been in vain, And that thou mean'st yet to return again. It says thy absence from some cause did grow, Which or I should not or I could not know. It tells me now that all those proofs, whereby I seem'd assured of thy disloyalty, May be but treacherous plots of some base foes That in thy absence sought our overthrows. Which if it prove, as yet methinks it may, Oh, what a burden shall I cast away! What cares shall I lay by, and to what height Tower in my new ascension to delight! Sure, ere the full of it I come to try, I shall ev'n surfeit in my joy and die. But such a loss might well be call'd a thriving, Since more is got by dying so than living. Come kill me then, my dear, if thou think fit, With that which never killed woman yet: Or write to me before, so shalt thou give Content more moderate that I may live; And when I see my staff of trust unbroken I will unspeak again what is mis-spoken. What I have written in dispraise of men I will recant, and praise as much again; In recompense I'll add unto their stories Encomiastic lines to imp their glories. And for those wrongs my love to thee hath done, Both I and it unto thy pity run: In whom, if the least guilt thou find to be, For ever let thy arms imprison me. Meanwhile I'll try if misery will spare Me so much respite to take truce with care, And patiently await the doubtful doom Which I expect from thee should shortly come; Much longing that I one way may be sped, And not still linger 'twixt alive and dead. For I can neither live yet as I should, Because I least enjoy of that I would; Nor quiet die, because, indeed, I first Would see some better days, or know the worst. Then hasten, dear; if to my end it be, It shall be welcome, 'cause it comes from thee; If to renew my comfort ought be sent, Let me not lose a minute of content. The precious time is short and will away, Let us enjoy each other while we may. Cares thrive, age creepeth on, men are but shades, Joys lessen, youth decays, and beauty fades; New turns come on, the old returneth never, If we let our go past, 'tis past for ever. THE AUTHOR'S RESOLUTION IN A SONNET. (1615 edition.) Shall I wasting in despair Die because a woman's fair? Or make pale my cheeks with care 'Cause another's rosy are? Be she fairer than the day, Or the flowery meads in May, If she think not well of me, What care I how fair she be? Shall my seely heart be pined 'Cause I see a woman kind? Or a well-disposed nature Joined with a lovely feature? Be she meeker, kinder than Turtle-dove or pelican, If she be not so to me What care I how kind she be? Shall a woman's virtues move Me to perish for her love? Or her well-deservings known Make me quite forget mine own? Be she with that goodness blest Which may merit name of best, If she be not such to me What care I how good she be? 'Cause her fortune seems too high, Shall I play the fool and die? She that bears a noble mind, If not outward helps she find, Thinks what with them he would do That without them dares her woo; And unless that mind I see What care I how great she be? Great, or good, or kind, or fair, I will ne'er the more despair; If she love me, this believe, I will die, ere she shall grieve: If she slight me when I woo I can scorn and let her go, For if she be not for me What care I for whom she be? INTER EQUITAND: PALINOD (1615, '17, '19, '20 editions.) My Genius, say what thoughts these pantings move? âThy thoughts of Love. What flames are these that set my heart on fire? âFlames of Desire. What are the means that these two underprop? âThy earnest Hope. Then yet I'm happy in my sweet friend's choice, For they in depth of passion may rejoice Whose thoughts and flames and means have such blest scope They may at once both Love, Desire, and Hope. But tell, what fruit at last my love shall gain? âHidden Disdain. What will that hope prove, which yet faith keeps fair? âHopeless Despair. What end will run my passions out of breath? âUntimely Death. Oh me! that passion, joined with faith and love, Should with my fortunes so ungracious prove That she'll no fruit, nor hope, nor end bequeath, But cruellest Disdain, Despair, and Death! To what new study shall I now apply? âStudy to Die. How might I end my care, and die content? âCare to Repent. And what good thoughts may make my end more holy? âThink on thy Folly. Well, so I will, and since my fate may give Nothing but discontents whilst here I live, My studies, cares, and thoughts I'll all apply To weigh my Folly well, Repent, and Die. SONNET. Hence away, thou Siren, leave me; Pish, unclasp your wanton arms; Sugared words can ne'er deceive me Though thou prove a thousand charms. Fie, fie, forbear; no common snare Can ever my affection chain; Thy sugared baits of love-deceits Are all bestowed on me in vain. I have elsewhere vowed a duty: Turn away thy tempting eye; Show not me thy painted beauty; These impostures I defy. My spirit loathes where gaudy clothes And feigned oaths may love obtain; I love her so whose look swears âno,â That all thy labour will be vain. I'm no slave to such as you be; Nor shall that soft snowy breast, Rolling eye, nor lip of ruby Ever rob me of my rest. Go, go display thy beauty's ray To some more-soon enamoured swain; Thy forced wiles of sighs and smiles Are all bestowed on me in vain. Can he prize the tainted posies That on other's breast are worn, Which may pluck the virgin roses From the never-touched thorn? I can go rest on her sweet breast That is the pride of Cynthia's train: Then stay thy tongue; thy mermaid's song Is all bestowed on me in vain. He's a fool that basely dallies Where each peasant mates with him. Shall I haunt the thronged valleys When there's noble hills to climb? No, no; though clowns are scared with frowns, I know the best can but disdain; Then those I'll prove, so will your love Be all bestowed on me in vain. Yet I would not deign embraces With the fairest queens that be, If another shared those graces Which they had bestowed on me. I'll grant that one my love, where none Shall come to rob me of my gain; The fickle heart makes tears, and art, And all, bestowed on me in vain. I do scorn to vow a duty Where each lustful lad may woo; Give me her whose sun-like beauty Buzzards dare not soar unto. She it is affords that bliss For which I would refuse no pain, But such as you, fond fools, adieu! You seek to captive me in vain. She that's proud in the beginning And disdains each looker-on, Is a harpy in the winning, But a turtle being won. Whate'er betide she'll ne'er divide The favour she to one doth deign But fondlings' loves uncertain proves; All, all that trust in them are vain. Therefore know, when I enjoy one, And for love employ my breath, She I court shall be a coy one, Though I purchase 't with my death. The pleasures there few aim at dare; But if perhaps a lover plain She is not won, nor I undone, By placing of my love in vain. Leave me, then, thou Siren, leave me; Take away these charmed arms; Craft thou seest can ne'er deceive me; I am proof 'gainst women's charms. Oft fools essay to lead astray The heart that constant must remain; But I the while do sit and smile To see them spend their love in vain. MASTER JOHNSON'S ANSWER TO MASTER WITHERS.The attribution of this poem is questionable. The attribution of this poem has been questioned. Withers. Shall I wasting in despair Die because a woman's fair, Or my cheeks make pale with care 'Cause another's rosy are? Be she fairer than the day, Or the flowery meads in May, If she be not so to me, What care I how fair she be? Johnson. Shall I mine affections slack 'Cause I see a woman's black, Or myself with care cast down 'Cause I see a woman brown? Be she blacker than the night, Or the blackest jet in sight, If she be not so to me, What care I how black she be? Withers. Shall my foolish heart be pined, 'Cause I see a woman's kind, Or a well-disposed nature Joined in a comely feature? Be she kind or meeker than Turtle-dove or pelican, If she be not so to me, What care I how kind she be? Johnson. Shall my foolish heart be brust 'Cause I see a woman's curst, Or a thwarting hoggish nature Joined in as bad a feature? Be she curst or fiercer then Brutish beast or savage men, If she [be] not so to me, What care I how curst she be? Withers. Shall a woman's virtues make Me to perish for her sake, Or her merit's value known Make me quite forget mine own? Be she with that goodness blest That may merit name of best, If she seem not so to me, What care I how good she be? Johnson. Shall a woman's vices make Me her vices quite forsake, Or her faults to me made known Make me think that I have none? Be she of the most accurst, And deserve the name of worst, If she be not so to me, What care I how bad she be? Withers. 'Cause her fortunes seem too high, Should I play the fool and die? He that bears a noble mind If not outward help he find, Think what with them he would do That without them dares to woo. And unless that mind I see, What care I how great she be? Johnson. 'Cause her fortunes seem too low, Shall I therefore let her go? He that bears an humble mind, And with riches can be kind, Think how kind a heart he'd have If he were some servile slave. And if that same mind I see, What care I how poor she be? Withers. Great, or good, or kind, or fair, I will ne'er the more despair; If she love me, then believe I will die, ere she shall grieve. If she slight me when I woo, I can slight and bid her go: If she be not fit for me, What care I for whom she be? Johnson. Poor, or bad, or curst, or black, I will ne'er the more be slack, If she hate me, then believe, She shall die ere I will grieve: If she like me when I woo, I can like and love her too: If that she be fit for me, What care I what others be? A LOVE SONNET. I loved a lass, a fair one, As fair as e'er was seen; She was indeed a rare one, Another Sheba queen. But fool as then I was, I thought she loved me too; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. Her hair like gold did glister, Each eye was like a star; She did surpass her sister, Which passed all others far. She would me honey call; She'd, O she'd kiss me too; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. In summer time to Medley, My love and I would go; The boatmen there stood ready, My love and I to row. For cream there would we call, For cakes, and for prunes too; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. Many a merry meeting My love and I have had; She was my only sweeting, She made my heart full glad. The tears stood in her eyes, Like to the morning dew; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. And as abroad we walked, As lovers' fashion is, Oft [as] we sweetly talked The sun should steal a kiss. The wind upon her lips Likewise most sweetly blew; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. Her cheeks were like the cherry. Her skin as white as snow; When she was blithe and merry, She angel-like did show. Her waist exceeding small, The fives did fit her shoe; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. In summer time or winter She had her heart's desire; I still did scorn to stint her From sugar, sack, or fire. The world went round about, No cares we ever knew; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. As we walked home together At midnight through the town, To keep away the weather O'er her I'd cast my gown. No cold my love should feel, Whate'er the heavens could do; But now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. Like doves we would be billing, And clip and kiss so fast; Yet she would be unwilling That I should kiss the last. They're Judas-kisses now, Since that they proved untrue; For now, alas! sh' 'as left me, Falero, lero, loo. To maidens' vows and swearing Henceforth no credit give; You may give them the hearing, But never them believe. They are as false as fair, Unconstant, frail, untrue; For mine, alas! has left me, Falero, lero, loo. 'Twas I that paid for all things, 'Twas others drank the wine; I cannot now recall things, Live but a fool to pine. 'Twas I that beat the bush, The bird to others flew; For she, alas! hath left me, Falero, lero, loo. If ever that dame Nature, For this false lover's sake, Another pleasing creature Like unto her would make, Let her remember this, To make the other true; For this, alas! hath left me, Falero, lero, loo. No riches now can raise me, No want make me despair; No misery amaze me, Nor yet for want I care. I have lost a world itself, My earthly heaven, adieu, Since she, alas! hath left me, Falero, lero, loo.

To the Christian Readers. EPITHALAMION. Bright northern star, and fair Minerva's peer, Sweet lady of this day, Great Britain's dear Lo, thy poor vassal that was erst so rude With his most rustic Satyrs to intrude, Once more like a poor sylvan now draws near, And in thy sacred presence dares appear. Oh, let not that sweet bow, thy brow, be bent To scare him with a shaft of discontent: One look with anger, nay, thy gentlest frown, Is twice enough to cast a greater down. My will is ever, never to offend These that are good; and what I here intend; Your worth compels me to. For lately grieved More than can be expressed or well believed Minding for ever to abandon sport, And live exiled from places of resort; Careless of all, I yielding to security, Thought to shut up my Muse in dark obscurity: And in content the better to repose, A lonely grove upon a mountain chose, East from Caer Winn, midway 'twixt Arle and Dis, Two springs where Britain's true Arcadia is. But ere I entered my intended course, Great Ãolus began to offer force. The boisterous king was grown so mad with rage, He here remembers and describes the late winter, which was so exceeding tempestuous and windy. That all the earth was but his fury's stage; Fire, air, earth, sea, were intermixed in one; Yet fire, through water, earth and air shone. The sea, as if she meant to whelm them under, Beat on the cliffs, and raged more loud than thunder: The reason of the tempestuos winter. And whilst the vales she with salt waves did fill, The air shower'd floods that drench'd our highest hill; And the proud trees, that would no duty know, Lay overturned, twenties in a row. Yea, every man for fear fell to devotion, Lest the whole isle should have been drench'd in th' ocean. Which I, perceiving, conjured up my Muse, The spirit whose good help I sometimes use, And though I meant to break her rest no more, I was then fain her aid for to implore; And by her help indeed I came to know Why both the air and seas were troubled so; For having urged her that she would unfold What cause she knew, thus much at last she told. Of late, quoth she, there is by powers divine A match concluded, 'twixt great Thame and Rhine; Two famous rivers, equal both to Nile: The one, the pride of Europe's greatest isle; Th' other, disdaining to be closely pent, Washes a great part of the Continent, Yet with abundance doth the wants supply Of the still-thirsting sea, that's never dry. And now these, being not alone endear'd To mighty Neptune and his watery herd, But also to the great and dreadful Jove With all his sacred companies above, Both have assented by their loves' inviting, To grace with their own presence this uniting. Jove called a summons, to the world's great wonder, 'Twas that we heard of late, which we thought thunder. A thousand legions he intends to send them, Of cherubins and angels to attend them: And those strong winds that did such blustering keep Were but the Tritons sounding in the deep, To warn each river, petty stream, and spring Their aid unto their sovereign to bring. The floods and showers that came so plenteous down, And lay entrench'd in every field and town, Were but retainers to the nobler sort That owe their homage at the watery court: Or else the streams, not pleased with their own store, To grace the Thames, their mistress, borrowed more, Exacting from their neighbouring dales and hills, But by consent all, nought against their wills. Yet now, since in this stir are brought to ground Many fair buildings, many hundreds drown'd, And daily found of broken ships great store, That lie dismembered upon every shore, With divers other mischiefs known to all, This is the cause that those great harms befall. Whilst other things in readiness did make, Hell's hateful hags from out their prisons brake, The cause of all such dangers as fell out during the distemperature of the air. And spiting at this hopeful match, began To wreak their wrath on air, earth, sea, and man. Some, having shapes of Romish shavelings got, Spew'd out their venom, and began to plot Which way to thwart it; others made their way With much distraction thorough land and sea Extremely raging. But almighty Jove Perceives their hate and envy from above; He'll check their fury, and in irons chain'd Their liberty abus'd shall be restrain'd: He'll shut them up from coming to molest The merriments of Hymen's holy feast, Where shall be knit that sacred Gordian knot Which in no age to come shall be forgot; Which policy nor force shall ne'er untie, But must continue to eternity; Which for the whole world's good was fore-decreed, With hope expected long, now come indeed; And of whose future glory, worth, and merit, Much I could speak with a prophetic spirit. Thus by my Muse's dear assistance finding The cause of this disturbance, with more minding My country's welfare than my own content, And longing to behold this tale's event, My lonely life I suddenly forsook, And to the court again my journey took. Meanwhile I saw the furious winds were laid; He noteth the most admirable alteration of the weather a while before these nuptials. The risings of the swelling waters stay'd. The winter 'gan to change in everything, And seem'd to borrow mildness of the spring. The violet and primrose fresh did grow, And as in April trimm'd both copse and row. The city, that I left in mourning clad, Drooping, as if it would have still been sad, I found deck'd up in robes so neat and trim, Fair Iris would have look'd but stale and dim In her best colours, had she there appear'd. The sorrows of the court I found well clear'd, Their woeful habits quite cast off, and tired In such a glorious fashion, I admired. The glorious preparation of this solemnity, the state whereof is here allegorically described. All her chief peers and choicest beauties too, In greater pomp than mortals use to do, Wait as attendants. Juno's come to see, Because she hears that this solemnity Exceeds fair Hippodamia's, where the strife 'Twixt her, Minerva, and lame Vulcan's wife Did first arise, and with her leads along A noble, stately, and a mighty throng. Venus, attended with her rarest features, Sweet lovely-smiling and heart-moving creatures, The very fairest jewels of her treasure, Able to move the senseless stones to pleasure, Of all her sweetest saints hath robbed their shrines, And brings them for the courtiers' valentines. Nor doth dame Pallas from these triumphs lurk; Her noblest wits she freely sets on work. Of late she summoned them unto this place To do your masques and revels better grace. Here Mars himself, too, clad in armour bright, Meaning the sea-fight, and the taking of the castle on the water, which was most artificially performed. Hath shown his fury in a bloodless fight; And both on land and water, sternly drest, Acted his bloody stratagems in jest: Which, to the people frighted by their error, With seeming wounds and death did add more terror; Besides, to give the greater cause of wonder, Jove did vouchsafe a rattling peal of thunder: Comets and meteors by the stars exhaled The fireworks he alludeth to those exhalations. Were from the middle region lately called, And to a place appointed made repair, To show their fiery friscols in the air, People innumerable do resort, As if all Europe here would keep one court: Yea, Hymen in his saffron-coloured weed To celebrate his rites is full agreed. All this I see: which seeing, makes me borrow Some of their mirth awhile, and lay down sorrow. And yet not this, but rather the delight My heart doth take in the much-hoped sight Of these thy glories, long already due; And this sweet comfort, that my eyes do view Thy happy bridegroom, Prince Count Palatine, Now thy best friend and truest valentine; Upon whose brow my mind doth read the story Of mighty fame, and a true future glory. Methinks I do foresee already how Princes and monarchs at his stirrup bow: I see him shine in steel, the bloody fields Already won, and how his proud foe yields. God hath ordain'd him happiness great store, And yet in nothing is he happy more Than in thy love, fair Princess; for, unless Heaven, like to man, be prone to fickleness, Thy fortunes must be greater in effect Than time makes show of, or men can expect. Yet, notwithstanding all those goods of fate, Thy mind shall ever be above thy state: For, over and beside thy proper merit, Our last Eliza grants her noble spirit To be redoubled on thee; and your names Being both one shall give you both one fames. Oh, blessed thou and they to whom thou giv'st The leave to be attendants where thou liv'st: And hapless we that must of force let go The matchless treasure we esteem of so. But yet we trust 'tis for our good and thine, Or else thou shouldst not change thy Thame for Rhine. We hope that this will the uniting prove Of countries and of nations by your love, And that from out your blessed loins shall come Another terror to the whore of Rome, And such a stout Achilles as shall make Her tottering walls and weak foundation shake; For Thetis-like thy fortunes do require Thy issue should be greater than his sire. But, gracious Princess, now since thus it fares, And God so well for you and us prepares; Since He hath deign'd such honours for to do you, And shown Himself so favourable to you; Since He hath changed your sorrows and your sadness Into such great and unexpected gladness; Oh, now remember you to be at leisure Sometime to think on Him amidst your pleasure: Let not these glories of the world deceive you, Nor her vain favours of yourself bereave you. Consider yet for all this jollity Y' are mortal, and must feel mortality; And that God can in midst of all your joys Quite dash this pomp, and fill you with annoys. Triumphs are fit for princes, yet we find They ought not wholly to take up the mind, Nor yet to be let past as things in vain; For out of all things wit will knowledge gain, Music may teach of difference in degree, The best-tuned Common-weals will framed be: And that he moves and lives with greatest grace That unto time and measure ties his pace. Then let these things be emblems to present He declares what use is to be made of these shows and triumphs, and what meditations the mind may be occupied about when we behold them. Your mind with a more lasting true content. When you behold the infinite resort, The glory and the splendour of the court, What wondrous favours God doth here bequeath you, How many hundred thousands are beneath you, And view with admiration your great bliss, Then with yourself you may imagine this: 'Tis but a blast or transitory shade, Which in the turning of a hand may fade: Honours, which you yourself did never win, And might, had God been pleased, another's bin: And think, if shadows have such majesty, What are the glories of eternity! Then by this image of a fight on sea, Wherein you heard the thund'ring cannons play, And saw flames breaking from their murthering throats, Which in true skirmish fling resistless shots, Your wisdom may, and will, no doubt, begin To cast what peril a poor soldier's in: You will conceive his miseries and cares, How many dangers, deaths, and wounds he shares: Then, though the most pass 't over and neglect them, That rhetoric will move you to respect them. And if hereafter you should hap to see Such mimic apes that courts' disgraces beâ I mean such chamber-combatants, who never Wear other helmet than a hat of beaver, Or ne'er board pinnace but in silken sail, And in the stead of boisterous shirts of mail Go arm'd in cambricâif that such a kite, I say, should scorn an eagle in your sight, Your wisdom judge, by this experience, can, Which hath most worth, hermaphrodite or man. The night's strange prospects, made to feed the eyes With artful fires mounted in the skies, Fireworks. Graced with horrid claps of sulphury thunders, May make you mind th' Almighty's greater wonders. Nor is there anything but you may thence Reap inward gain, as well as please the sense. But pardon me, oh fairest, that am bold My heart thus freely, plainly to unfold. What though I know you knew all this before, My love this shows, and that is something more. Do not my honest service here disdain, I am a faithful though an humble swain. I'm none of those that have the means or place With shows of cost to do your nuptials grace; But, only master of mine own desire, Am hither come with others to admire. I am not of those Heliconian wits, Whose pleasing strains the court's known humour fits, But a poor rural shepherd, that for need Can make sheep music on an oaten reed: Yet for my love, I'll this be bold to boast, It is as much to you as his that's most. Which, since I no way else can now explain, If you'll in midst of all these glories deign To lend your ears unto my Muse so long, She shall declare it in a wedding song. EPITHALAMION. Valentine, good-morrow to thee, The marriage being on S. Valentine's day, the Author shows it by beginning with the salutation of a supposed valentine. Love and service both I owe thee, And would wait upon thy pleasure, But I cannot be at leisure; For I owe this day as debtor To a thousand times thy better. Hymen now will have effected What hath been so long expected: Thame, thy mistress, now unwedded, Soon must with a prince be bedded. If thou'lt see her virgin ever, Come and do it now or never. Where art thou, oh fair Aurora? Call in Ver and lady Flora: And, you daughters of the morning, In your neat'st and feat'st adorning, Clear your foreheads and be sprightful That this day may seem delightful. All you nymphs that use the mountains, Or delight in groves and fountains: Shepherdesses, you that dally Either upon hill or valley: And you daughters of the bower, That acknowledge Vesta's power, Oh, you sleep too long; awake ye, See how Time doth overtake ye. Hark, the lark is up and singeth, And the house with echoes ringeth. Precious hours, why neglect ye, Whilst affairs thus expect ye? Come away, upon my blessing; The bride-chamber lies to dressing: Strow the ways with leaves of roses, Some make garlands, some make posies: 'Tis a favour, and 't may joy you. That your mistress will employ you, Where's Severn.Sabrina with her daughters That do sport about her waters, Those that with their locks of amber Haunt the fruitful hills of Wales.Camber? We must have to fill the number All the nymphs of Trent and Humber. Fie, your haste is scarce sufficing, For the bride's awake and rising. Enter, beauties, and attend her, All your helps and service lend her; With your quaint'st and new'st devices Trim your lady, fair Thamisis. See, she's ready; with joys greet her; Lads, go bid the bridegroom meet her; But from rash approach advise him, Lest a too much joy surprise him: None I e'er knew yet that dared View an angel unprepared. Now unto the church she hies her; Envy bursts, if she espies her: In her gestures as she paces Are united all the graces, Which who sees and hath his senses Loves in spite of all defences. O most true majestic creature! Nobles, did you note her feature? Felt you not an inward motion Tempting love to yield devotion, And as you were e'en desiring Something check you for aspiring? That's her virtue, which still tameth Loose desires and bad thoughts blameth; For whilst others were unruly, She observed Diana truly: And hath by that means obtained Gifts of her that none have gained. Yon's the bridegroom, d'ye not spy him? See how all the ladies eye him. Venus his perfection findeth, And no more Adonis mindeth. Much of him my heart divineth, On whose brow all virtue shineth. Two such creatures Nature would not Let one place long keepâshe should not: One she'll have, she cares not whether, But our loves can spare her neither. Therefore, ere we'll so be spited, They in one shall be united. Nature's self is well contented By that means to be prevented. And behold they are retired, So conjoin'd, as we desired; Hand in hand not only fixed, But their hearts are intermixed. Happy they and we that see it, For the good of Europe be it. And hear, heaven, my devotion, Make this Rhine and Thame an ocean, That it may with might and wonder Whelm the pride of Tiber is the river which runneth by Rome.Tiber under. Now yon Whitehall.hall their persons shroudeth, Whither all this people crowdeth: There they feasted are with plenty, Sweet ambrosia is no dainty. Grooms quaff nectar; for there's meeter, Yea, more costly wines and sweeter. Young men all, for joy go ring ye, And your merriest carols sing ye. Here's of damsels many choices, Let them tune their sweetest voices. Fet the Muses, too, to cheer them; They can ravish all that hear them. Ladies, 'tis their highness' pleasures To behold you foot the measures; Lovely gestures addeth graces, To your bright and angel faces. Give your active minds the bridle: Nothing worse than to be idle. Worthies, your affairs forbear ye, For the state awhile may spare ye: Time was that you loved sportingâ Have you quite forgot your courting? Joy the heart of cares beguileth: Semel in anno ridet Apol. Once a year Apollo smileth. Fellow shepherds, how I pray you Can your flocks at this time stay you? Let us also hie us thither, Let's lay all our wits together, And some pastoral invent them That may show the love we meant them. I myself though meanest stated, And in court now almost hated, Will knit up my Abuses stript and whipt.Scourge, and venter In the midst of them to enter; For I know there's no disdaining Where I look for entertaining. See, methinks the very season, He noteth the mildness of the winter which, excepting that the beginning was very windy, was as temperate as the spring. As if capable of reason, Hath lain by her native rigour, The fair sunbeams have more vigour; They are Ãol's most endeared, For the air's still'd and cleared. Fawns and lambs and kids do play, In the honour of this day; The shrill blackbird and the thrush Hops about in every bush; And among the tender twigs Chant their sweet harmonious jigs. Yea, and moved by this example Most men are of opinion that this day every bird doth choose her mate for that year. They do make each grove a temple Where their time the best way using, They their summer loves are choosing. And, unless some churl do wrong them, There's not an odd bird among them. Yet I heard as I was walking Groves and hills by echoes talking; Reeds unto the small brooks whistling, Whilst they danced with pretty rushling. Then for us to sleep 'twere pity, Since dumb creatures are so witty. But oh, Titan, thou dost dally, Hie thee to thy western valley; Let this night one hour borrow, She shall pay't again to-morrow; And if thou'lt that favour do them, Send thy sister PhÅbe to them. But she's come herself unasked, And brings By these he means the two masques, one of them being presented by the Lords, the other by the Gentry.gods and heroes masked. None yet saw or heard in story Such immortal mortal glory. View not without preparation, Lest you faint in admiration. Say, my lords, and speak truth barely, Moved they not exceeding rarely? Did they not such praises merit As if flesh had all been spirit? True indeed, yet I must tell them There was one did far excel them. But, alas! this is ill dealing, Night unwares away is stealing: Their delay the poor bed wrongeth That for bride with bridegroom longeth, And above all other places Must be blest with their embraces. Revellers, then now forbear ye, And unto your rests prepare ye: Let's awhile your absence borrow, Sleep to-night and dance to-morrow. We could well allow your courting, But 'twill hinder better sporting. They are gone, and night all lonely Leaves the bride with bridegroom only. Muse, now tell, for thou hast power To fly through wall or tower, What contentments their hearts cheereth, And how lovely she appeareth. And yet do not; tell it no man, Rare conceits may so grow common: Do not to the vulgar show them, 'Tis enough that thou dost know them. Their ill hearts are but the centre, Where all misconceivings enter. But thou, Luna, that dost lightly Haunt our downs and forests nightly; Thou that favour'st generation, And art help to procreation; See their issue thou so cherish, I may live to see it flourish. And you planets, in whose power Doth consist these lives of our, You that teach us divinations, Help with all your constellations, How to frame in her a creature Blest in fortune, wit, and feature. Lastly, oh, you angels, ward them, Set your sacred spells to guard them; Chase away such fears or terrors As not being seem through errors; Yea, let not a dream's molesting Make them start when they are resting. But Thou chiefly, most adored, That shouldst only be implored; Thou to whom my meaning tendeth, Whither e'er in show it bendeth; Let them rest to-night from sorrow And awake with joy to-morrow. Oh, to my request be heedful, Grant them that and all things needful. Let not these my strains of folly Make true prayer be unholy; But if I have here offended, Help, forgive, and see it mended. Deign me this; and if my Muse's Hasty issue she peruses, Make it unto her seem grateful, Though to all the world else hateful. But howe'er yet, soul, persever Thus to wish her good for ever. Thus ends the day together with my song, Oh, may the joys thereof continue long! Let heaven's just, all-seeing, sacred power Favour this happy marriage day of your; And bless you in your chaste embraces so, We Britons may behold before you go The hopeful issue we shall count so dear, And whom, unborn, his foes already fear. Yea, I desire that all your sorrows may Never be more than they have been to-day. Which hoping, for acceptance now I sue, And humbly bid your grace and court adieu. I saw the sight I came for, which I know Was more than all the world beside could show But if amongst Apollo's lays you can Be pleased to lend a gentle ear to Pan, Or think your country shepherd loves as dear As if he were a courtier or a peer, Then I, that else must to my cell of pain, Will joyful turn unto my flock again, And there unto my fellow shepherds tell Why you are lov'd, wherein you do excel. And when we drive our flocks afield to graze them, So chant your praises that it shall amaze them: And think that fate hath new recall'd from death Their still-lamented sweet Elizabeth. For though they see the court but now and then, They know desert as well as greater men: And honoured fame in them doth live or die, As well as in the mouth of majesty. But taking granted what I here entreat, At heaven for you my devotions beat; And though I fear fate will not suffer me To do you service where your fortunes be, Howe'er my skill hath yet despised seem'd, And my unripen'd wit been mis-esteem'd, When all this costly show away shall flit, And not one live that doth remember it, If envy's trouble let not to persever, I'll find a means to make it known for ever. CERTAIN EPIGRAMS CONCERNING MARRIAGE. Epigram 1. 'Tis said, in marriage above all the rest The children of a king find comforts least, Because without respect of love or hate They must, and oft be, ruled by the State; But if contented love, religion's care, Equality in state, and years declare A happy match, as I suppose no less, Then rare and great's Eliza's happiness. Epigram 2. God was the first that marriage did ordain, By making one, two; and two, and one again, Epigram 3. Soldier, of thee I ask, for thou canst best, Having known sorrow, judge of joy and rest; What greater bliss than after all thy harms To have a wife that's fair and lawful thine, And lying prison'd 'twixt her ivory arms, There tell what thou hast 'scaped by powers divine? How many round thee thou hast murthered seen, How oft thy soul hath been near-hand expiring, How many times thy flesh hath wounded been: Whilst she thy fortune and thy worth admiring, With joy of health and pity of thy pain, Doth weep and kiss, and kiss and weep again. Epigram 4. Fair Helen having stain'd her husband's bed, And mortal hatred 'twixt two kingdoms bred, Had still remaining in her so much good That heroes for her lost their dearest blood: Then if with all that ill such worth may last, Oh, what is she worth that's as fairâand chaste! Epigram 5. Old Orpheus knew a good wife's worth so well That when his died he followed her to hell, And for her loss at the Elysian grove He did not only ghosts to pity move, But the sad poet breath'd his sighs so deep, 'Tis said, the devils could not choose but weep. Epigram 6. Long did I wonder, and I wonder much, Rome's Church should from her clergy take that due: Thought I, why should she that contentment grutch? What, doth she all with continence endue? No; but why then are they debarr'd that state? Is she become a foe unto her own? Doth she the members of her body hate, Or is it for some other cause unshown? Oh yes, they find a woman's lips so dainty, They tie themselves from one 'cause they'll have twenty. Epigram 7. Women, as some men say, unconstant be; 'Tis like enough, and so no doubt are men: Nay, if their scapes we could so plainly see, I fear that scarce there will be one for ten. Men have but their own lusts that tempt to ill: Women have lusts and men's allurements too: Alas, if their strengths cannot curb their will, What should poor women, that are weaker, do? O, they had need be chaste and look about them, That strive 'gainst lust within and knaves without them.</field>

PHILARETE TO HIS MISTRESS. Hail, thou fairest of all creatures Upon whom the sun doth shine, Model of all rarest features And perfections most divine. Thrice all hail, and blessed be Those that love and honour thee. Of thy worth this rural story Thy unworthy swain hath penn'd; And to thy ne'er-ending glory, These plain numbers doth commend, Which ensuing times shall warble, When 'tis lost that's writ in marble. Though thy praise and high deservings Cannot all be here express'd, Yet my love and true observings Someway ought to be profess'd, And where greatest love we see, Highest things attempted be. By thy beauty I have gained To behold the best perfections; By the love I have obtained, To enjoy the best affections. And my tongue to sing thy praise, Love and beauty thus doth raise. What although in rustic shadows I a shepherd's breeding had? And confined to these meadows So in homespun russet clad? Such as I have now and then Dared as much as greater men. Though a stranger to the Muses, Young, obscured, and despis'd: Yet such art thy love infuses, That I thus have poetiz'd. Read, and be content to see Thy admired power in me. And, oh grant, thou sweetest beauty Wherewith ever earth was grac'd, That this trophy of my duty May with favour be embrac'd: And disdain not in these rhymes To be sung to after-times. Let those doters on Apollo That adore the Muses so, And like geese each other follow, See what love alone can do. For in love-lays, grove and field Nor to schools nor courts will yield. On this glass of thy perfection If that any women pry, Let them thereby take direction To adorn themselves thereby. And if aught amiss they view, Let them dress themselves anew. Young men shall by this acquainted With the truest beauties grow, So the counterfeit or painted They may shun when them they know. But the way all will not find, For some eyes have, yet are blind. Thee entirely I have loved, So thy sweetness on me wrought; Yet thy beauty never moved Ill temptations in my thought, But still did thy beauty's ray, Sun-like, drive those fogs away. Those that mistresses are named, And for that suspected be, Shall not need to be ashamed, If they pattern take by thee; Neither shall their servants fear Favours openly to wear. Thou to no man favour deignest But what's fitting to bestow; Neither servants entertainest That can ever wanton grow; For the more they look on thee, Their desires still bettered be. This thy picture, therefore, show I Naked unto every eye, Yet no fear of rival know I, Neither touch of jealousy; For the more make love to thee, I the more shall pleased be. I am no Italian lover That will mew thee in a jail; But thy beauty I discover, English-like, without a veil. If thou may'st be won away, Win and wear thee he that may. Yet in this thou may'st believe me, So indifferent though I seem, Death with tortures would not grieve me More than loss of thy esteem; For if virtue me forsake, All a scorn of me will make. Then as I on thee relying Do no changing fear in thee, So, by my defects supplying, From all changing keep thou me; That unmatched we may prove, Thou for beauty, I for love. Then while their loves are forgotten Who to pride and lust were slaves, And their mistresses quite rotten Lie unthought on in their graves. Kings and queens, in their despite, Shall to mind us take delight. FAIR VIRTUE OR THE MISTRESS OF PHILARETE. Two pretty rills do meet, and meeting make Within one valley a large silver lake, About whose banks the fertile mountains stood In ages passed bravely crown'd with wood, Which, lending cold-sweet shadows, gave it grace To be accounted Cynthia's bathing-place, And from her father Neptune's brackish court Fair Thetis thither often would resort, Attended by the fishes of the sea, Which in those sweeter waters came to play. There would the daughter of the sea-god dive; And thither came the land-nymphs every eve To wait upon her, bringing for her brows Rich garlands of sweet flowers and beechy boughs. For pleasant was that pool, and near it then Was neither rotten marsh nor boggy fen. It was nor overgrown with boist'rous sedge, Nor grew there rudely then along the edge A bending willow nor a prickly bush, Nor broadleaf'd flag, nor reed, nor knotty rush; But here, well order'd, was a grove with bowers: There grassy plots set round about with flowers. Here you might through the water see the land Appear, strow'd o'er with white or yellow sand. Yon, deeper was it; and the wind by whiffs Would make it rise and wash the little cliffs, On which oft pluming sat, unfrighted than, The gaggling wildgoose and the snow-white swan: With all those flocks of fowls which to this day Upon those quiet waters breed and play. For though those excellences wanting be, Which once it had, it is the same that we By transposition name the Ford of Arle, And out of which along a chalky marl That river trills whose waters wash the fort In which brave Arthur kept his royal court. North-east, not far from this great pool, there lies A tract of beechy mountains, that arise With leisurely-ascending to such height, As from their tops the warlike Isle of Wight You in the ocean's bosom may espy, Though near two hundred furlongs thence it lie. The pleasant way, as up those hills you climb, Is strewed o'er with marjoram and thyme, Which grows unset. The hedgerows do not want The cowslip, violet, primrose, nor a plant That freshly scents, as birch both green and tall; Low sallows, on whose bloomings bees do fall; Fair woodbines, which about the hedges twine; Smooth privet, and the sharp, sweet eglantine; With many moe, whose leaves and blossoms fair The earth adorn, and oft perfume the air. When you unto the highest do attain, An intermixture both of wood and plain You shall behold, which, though aloft it lie, Hath downs for sheep and fields for husbandry. So much, at least, as little needeth more, If not enough to merchandise their store. In every row hath Nature planted there Some banquet for the hungry passenger. For here the hazel-nut and filbert grows; There bulloes, and a little further sloes; On this hand standeth a fair wilding-tree; On that large thickets of black cherries be. The shrubby fields are raspice-orchards there, The new-fell'd woods like strawberry-gardens are: And had the king of rivers blest those hills With some small number of such pretty rills As flow elsewhere, Arcadia had not seen A sweeter plot of earth than this had been. For what offence this place was scanted so Of springing waters, no record doth show, Nor have they old tradition left that tells; But till this day at fifty-fathom wells The shepherds drink. And strange it was to hear Of any swain that ever lived there, Who either in a pastoral ode had skill, Or knew to set his fingers to a quill. For rude they were who there inhabited; And to a dull contentment being bred, They no such art esteem'd, nor took much heed Of anything the world without them did. E'en there, and in the least-frequented place Of all these mountains, is a little space Of pleasant ground hemm'd in with dropping trees, And those so thick that PhÅbus scarcely sees The earth they grow on once in all the year, Nor what is done among the shadows there. Along those lonely paths, where never came Report of Pan or of Apollo's name, Nor rumour of the Muses till of late, Some nymphs were wand'ring; and by chance or fate Upon a laund arrived, where they met The little flock of pastor Philaret. They were a troop of beauties known well nigh Through all the plains of happy Britany. A shepherd's lad was he, obscure and young, Who, being first that ever there had sung, In homely verse expressed country loves, And only told them to the beechy groves, As if to sound his name he never meant Beyond the compass that his sheep-walk went. They saw not him, nor them perceived he, For in the branches of a maple-tree He shrouded sat, and taught the hollow hill To echo forth the music of his quill, Whose tattling voice redoubled so the sound, That where he was concealed they quickly found. And there they heard him sing a madrigal, That soon betrayed his cunning to them all. Full rude it was, no doubt, but such a song Those rustic and obscured shades among Was never heard, they say, by any ear, Until his Muses had inspired him there. Though mean and plain his country habit seemed, Yet by his song the ladies rightly deemed That either he had travelled abroad, Where swains of better knowledge make abode, Or else that some brave nymph, who used that grove, Had deigned to enrich him with her love. Approaching nearer, therefore, to this swain, They him saluted, and he them again, In such good fashion as well seemed to be According to their state and his degree. Which greetings being passed, and much chat, Concerning him, the place, with this and that, He to an arbour doth those beauties bring, Where he them prays to sit, they him to sing, And to express that untaught country art, In setting forth the mistress of his heart, Which they o'erheard him practise, when unseen He thought no ear had witness of it been. At first, as much unable, he refused, And seemed willing to have been excused From such a task. âFor, trust me, nymphs,â quoth he, âI would not purposely uncivil be, Nor churlish in denying what you crave; But, as I hope great Pan my flock will save, I rather wish that I might, heard of none, Enjoy my music by myself alone; Or that the murmurs of some little flood, Joined with the friendly echoes of the wood, Might be the impartial umpires of my wit, Than vent it where the world might hear of it. And doubtless I had sung less loud while-ere, Had I but thought of any such so near. Not that I either wish obscurified Her matchless beauty, or desire to hide Her sweet perfections; for by Love I swear, The utmost happiness I aim at here, Is but to compass worth enough to raise A high-built trophy equal with her praise. Which, fairest ladies, I shall hope in vain, For I was meanly bred on yonder plain; And, though I can well prove my blood to be Deriv'd from no ignoble stems to me, Yet fate and time them so obscured and crost, That with their fortunes their esteem is lost: And whatsoe'er repute I strive to win, Now from myself alone it must begin. For I have no estate, nor friends, nor fame, To purchase either credit to my name, Or gain a good opinion, though I do Ascend the height I shall aspire unto. If any of those virtues yet I have, Which honour to my predecessors gave, There's all that's left me. And though some contemn Such needy jewels, yet it was for them My fair one did my humble suit affect, And deigned my adventurous love respect; And by their help I passage hope to make Through such poor things, as I dare undertake. But, you may say, what goodly thing, alas, Can my despised meanness bring to pass? Or what great monument of honour raise To Virtue, in these vice-abounding days, In which a thousand times more honour finds Ignoble gotten means, than noble minds? Indeed, the world affordeth small reward For honest minds, and therefore her regard I seek not after; neither do I care, If I have bliss, how others think I fare: For, so my thoughts have rest, it irks not me, Though none but I do know how blest they be. Here, therefore, in these groves and hidden plains, I pleased sit alone, and many strains I carol to myself these hills among, Where no man comes to interrupt my song. Whereas, if my rude lays make known I should Beyond their home, perhaps some carpers would, Because they have not heard from whence we be, Traduce, abuse, and scoff both them and me. For if our great and learned shepherds, who Are graced with wit, and fame, and favours too, With much ado escape uncensur'd may, What hopes have I to pass unscoff'd, I pray, Who yet unto the Muses am unknown, And live unhonour'd here among mine own? A gadding humour seldom taketh me To range out further than yon mountains be; Nor hath applausive rumour born my name Upon the spreading wings of sounding fame. Nor can I think, fair nymphs, that you resort For other purpose than to make a sport At that simplicity which shall appear Among the rude untutor'd shepherds here. I know that you my noble mistress ween At best a homely milk-maid on the green, Or some such country lass, as tasked stays At servile labour until holidays. For poor men's virtues so neglected grow, And are now prized at a rate so low, As 'tis impossible you should be brought To let it with belief possess your thought, That any nymph, whose love might worthy be, Would deign to cast respective eyes on me. You see I live possessing none of those Gay things with which the world enamour'd grows. To woo a courtly beauty I have neither Rings, bracelets, jewels, nor a scarf, nor feather. I use no double-dyed cloth to wear; No scrip embroider'd richly do I bear; No silken belt, nor sheephook laid with pearls, To win me favour from the shepherds' girls; No place of office or command I keep, But this my little flock of homely sheep; And in a word, the sum of all my pelf Is thisâI am the master of myself. No doubt in courts of princes you have been, And all the pleasures of the palace seen. There you beheld brave courtly passages Between heroÃ«s and their mistresses. You there, perhaps, in presence of the King, Have heard his learned bards and poets sing. And what contentment, then, can wood or field To please your curious understandings yield? I know you walked hither but to prove What silly shepherds do conceive of love; Or to make trial how our simpleness Can passion's force or beauty's power express; And when you are departed, you will joy To laugh, or descant on the shepherd's boy. But yet, I vow, if all the art I had Could any more esteem, or glory add To her unmatched worth, I would not weigh What you intended.â âPrithee, lad,â quoth they, âDistrustful of our court'sy do not seem. Her nobleness can never want esteem, Nor thy concealed measures be disgraced, Though in a meaner person they were placed, If thy too modestly refused quill But reach that height, which we suppose it will. Thy meanness or obscureness cannot wrong The nymph thou shalt eternize in thy song. For, as it higher rears thy glory, that A noble mistress thou hast aimed at, So more unto her honour it will prove, That, whilst deceiving shadows others move, Her constant eyes could pass unmoved by The subtle time's bewitching bravery, And those obscured virtues love in thee, That with despised meanness clouded be. Now, then, for her sweet sake, whose beauteous eye Hath filled thy soul with heavenly poesy, Sing in her praise some new inspired strain; And, if within our power there shall remain A favour to be done may pleasure thee, Ask, and obtain it, whatsoe'er it be.â âFair ladies,â quoth the lad, âsuch words as those Compel me can:â and, therewithal he rose, Return'd them thanks, obeisance made, and than Down sat again, and thus to sing began. You that at a blush can tell Where the best perfections dwell, And the substance can conjecture, By a shadow, or a picture, Come and try if you by this Know my mistress, who she is. For though I am far unable Here to match Apelles' table, Or draw Zeuxes' cunning lines, Who so painted Bacchus' vines That the hungry birds did muster Round the counterfeited cluster; Though I vaunt not to inherit Petrarch's yet unequall'd spirit; Nor to quaff the sacred well, Half so deep as Astrophel: Though the much-commended Celia, Lovely Laura, Stella, Delia, Who in former times excell'd, Live in lines unparallel'd; Making us believe 'twere much, Earth should yield another such; Yet, assisted but by nature, I essay to paint a creature Whose rare worth in future years Shall be prais'd as much as theirs. Nor let any think amiss That I have presumed this; For a gentle nymph is she, And hath often honour'd me. She's a noble spark of light, In each part so exquisite, Had she in times passed been They had made her beauty's queen. Then shall cowardly despair Let the most unblemish'd fair, For default of some poor art Which her favour may impart, And the sweetest beauty fade That was ever born or made? Shall, of all the fair ones, she Only so unhappy be, As to live in such a time, In so rude, so dull a clime, Where no spirit can ascend High enough to apprehend Her unprized excellence, Which lies hid from common-sense? Never shall a stain so vile Blemish this, our poets' isle. I myself will rather run And seek out for Helicon. I will wash and make me clean In the waves of Hippocrene; And in spite of fortune's bars, Climb the hill that braves the stars, Where, if I can get no Muse That will any skill infuse, Or my just attempt prefer, I will make a Muse of her, Whose kind heat shall soon distil Art into my ruder quill. By her favour I will gain Help to reach so rare a strain, That the learned hills shall wonder How the untaught valleys under, Met with raptures so divine, Without knowledge of the Nine. I, that am a shepherd's swain, Piping on the lowly plain, And no other music can, Than what learn'd I have of Pan, I, who never sung the lays That deserve Apollo's bays, Hope not only here to frame Measures which shall keep her name From the spite of wasting times, But, enshrined in sacred rhymes, Place her where her form divine Shall to after ages shine, And without respect of odds, Vie renown with demi-gods. Then, whilst of her praise I sing, Hearken, valley, grove, and spring; Listen to me, sacred fountains, Solitary rocks, and mountains; Satyrs, and you wanton elves, That do nightly sport yourselves; Shepherds, you that on the reed Whistle while your lambs do feed; Aged woods and floods, that know What hath been long times ago, Your more serious notes among, Hear how I can in my song Set a nymph's perfection forth; And when you have heard her worth, Say if such another lass Ever known to mortal was. Listen, lordlings, you that most Of your outward honours boast; And you gallants, that think scorn We, to lowly fortunes born, Should attain to any graces Where you look for sweet embraces; See if all those vanities Whereon your affection lies, Or the titles, or the power, By your fathers' virtues your, Can your mistresses enshrine In such state as I will mine, Who am forced to importune Favours in despite of fortune. Beauties, listen, chiefly you, That yet know not virtue's due. You that think there are no sports, Nor no honours, but in courts; Though of thousands there lives not Two, but die and are forgot; See if any palace yields Ought more glorious than the fields, And consider well if we May not as high-flying be In our thoughts, as you that sing In the chambers of a King. See, if our contented minds, Whom Ambition never blindsâ We, that clad in homespun grey, On our own sweet meadows playâ Cannot honour, if we please, Where we list as well as these; Or as well of worth approve, Or with equal passions love. See if beauties may not touch Our soon-loving hearts as much; Or our services effect Favours, with as true respect In your good conceits to rise, As our painted butterflies. And you fairest, give her room, When your sex's pride doth come, For that subject of my song I invoke these groves among, To be witness of the lays Which I carol in her praise. And because she soon will see If my measures faulty be, Whilst I chant them, let each rhyme Keep a well-proportion'd time, And with strains that are divine Meet her thoughts in every line. Let each accent there present To her soul a new content; And with ravishings so seize her, She may feel the height of pleasure. You enchanting spells that lie Lurking in sweet poesy, And to none else will appear But to those that worthy are, Make her know there is a power Ruling in these charms of your, That transcends a thousand heights Ordinary men's delights; And can leave within her breast Pleasures not to be exprest. Let her linger on each strain As if she would hear 't again, And were loth to part from thence Till she had the quintessence Out of each conceit she meets, And had stored her with those sweets. Make her by your art to see, I, that am her swain, was he Unto whom all beauties here Were alike and equal dear; That I could of freedom boast, And of favours with the most; Yet now, nothing more affecting, Sing of her, the rest neglecting. Make her heart with full compassion Judge the merit of true passion; And as much my love prefer, As I strive to honour her. Lastly, you that will, I know, Hear me, wh'er you should or no; You that seek to turn all flowers, By your breath's infectious powers, Into such rank, loathsome weeds As your dunghill nature breeds; Let your hearts be chaste, or here Come not till you purge them clear. Mark, and mark then, what is worst: For whate'er it seem at first, If you bring a modest mind, You shall nought immodest find. But if any too severe Hap to lend a partial ear, Or out of his blindness yawn Such a word as Oh profane, Let him know thus much from me, If here's ought profane, 'tis he Who applies these excellences Only to the touch of senses, And, dim-sighted, cannot see Where the soul of this may be. Yet, that no offence may grow, 'Tis their choice to stay or go. Or if any for despite Rather comes than for delight, For his presence I'll not pray, Nor his absence; come he may. Critics shall admitted be, Though I know they'll carp at me; For I neither fear nor care What in this their censures are. If the verse here used be Their dislike, it liketh me. If my method they deride, Let them know Love is not tied In his free discourse to choose Such strict rules as arts-men use. These may prate of Love; but they Know him not: for he will play From the matter now and then, Off and on, and off again. If this prologue tedious seem, Or the rest too long they deem, Let them know my love they win, Though they go ere I begin, Just as if they should attend me Till the last, and there commend me. For I will for no man's pleasure Change a syllable or measure, Neither for their praises add Ought to mend what they think bad, Since it never was my fashion To make work of recreation. Pedants shall not tie my strains To our antique poets' veins; As if we, in latter days, Knew to love, but not to praise. Being born as free as these, I will sing as I shall please, Who as well new paths may run, As the best before have done. I disdain to make my song For their pleasures short or long. If I please I'll end it here: If I list I'll sing this year. And, though none regard of it, By myself I pleas'd can sit, And with that contentment cheer me, As if half the world did hear me. But because I am assured All are either so conjured, As they will my song attend With the patience of a friend, Or, at least, take note, that I Care not much, now willingly I these goodly colours lay, Wind, nor rain, shall wear away; But retain their purest glass When the statues made of brass For some prince's more renown, Shall be wholly overthrown, Or, consum'd with canker'd rust, Lie neglected in the dust. And my reason gives direction, When I sing of such perfection, First, those beauties to declare, Which, though hers, without her are. To advance her fame, I find, Those are of a triple kind. Privileges she hath store, At her birth, since, and before. From before her birth the fame She of high descents may claim; Whose well-gotten honours may Her deserving more display. For from heavenly race she springs, And from high and mighty kings. At her birth she was by fate In those parents fortunate Whose estates and virtues stood Answerable to their blood. Then the nation, time, and place, To the rest may add some grace. For the people, with the clime, And the fashions of the time, In all which she hath been blest, By enjoying them at best, Do not only mend the features, But oft-times make better natures. Whereas, those who hap not so, Both deform'd and ruder grow. In these climes and latter days To deserve sweet beauty's praise, Where so many females dwell, That each seemeth to excel, Is more glory twenty-fold, Than it was in days of old, When our ordinary fair ones Might have been esteemed rare ones, And have made a subject fit For their bravest poet's wit. Little rush-lights, or a spark, Shineth fairly in the dark, And to him occasion gives That from sight of lesser lives To adore it; yet the ray Of one torch will take away All the light of twenty more That shin'd very well before. So those petty beauties, which Made the times before us rich, Though but sparkles, seem'd a flame Which hath been increased by fame, And their true affections, who Better never liv'd to know. Whereas, her if they had seen, She had sure adored been, And taught ages past to sing Sweeter in their sonneting. Such a ray, so clear, so bright, Had outshined all the light Of a thousand such as theirs, Who were then esteemed stars; And would have enlighten'd near Half the world's wide hemisphere. She is fairest that may pass For a fair one, where the lass Trips it on the country green, That may equal Sparta's queen; Where in every street you see Throngs of nymphs and ladies be, That are fair enough to move Angels and enamour Jove. She must matchless features bring That now moves a Muse to sing, Whenas one small province may Show more beauties in a day Than the half of Europe could Breed them in an age of old. Such is she, and such a lot Hath her rare perfection got. Since her birth, to make the colour Of so true a beauty fuller, And to give a better grace To that sweetness in the face, She hath all the furth'rance had, Noble educations add; And not only knoweth all Which our ladies courtship call, With those knowledges that do Grace her sex, and suit thereto, But she hath attain'd to find, What is rare with womankind, Excellences whereby she May in soul delighted be, And reap more contentment than One of twenty thousand can. By this means hath better'd bin All without her, and within. For it hath by adding arts To adorn her native parts, Raised to a noble flame, Which shall lighten forth her fame, Those dear sparks of sacred fire Which the Muses did inspire At her birth, that she complete Might with them befit a seat. But, perhaps I do amiss To insist so long on this. These are superficial things, And but slender shadowings To the work I have in hand. Neither can you understand What her excellence may be, Till herself describ'd you see. Nor can mine or any pen Paint her half so lovely then As she is indeed. For here Might those Deities appear, Which young Paris view'd at will, Naked, upon Ida hill; That I from those three might take All their beauties one to make; Those, no question, well compact, Would have made up one exact. Something yet we miss of might, To express her sweetness right; Juno's majesty would fit; Venus beauty, Pallas wit Might have brought to pattern hers, In some show'd particulars, But they never can express Her whole frame or worthiness With those excellences which Make both soul and body rich. Pallas sometimes was untoward, Venus wanton, Juno froward; Yea, all three infected were, With such faults as women are. And though falsely deified, Frailties had, which she'll deride. By herself must therefore she Or by nothing pattern'd be. And I hope to paint her so, By herself, that you shall know I have served no common dame Of mean worth or vulgar fame, But a nymph that's fairer than Pen or pencil portrait can. And to-morrow if you stray Back again this uncouth way, I my simple art will show; But the time prevents me now. For, except at yonder glade, All the land is under shade; That, before these ewes be told, Those my wethers in the fold, Ten young wainlings driven down To the well beneath the town, And my lambkins changed from Broom-leas to the mead at home, 'Twill be far in night: and so I shall make my father woe For my stay, and be in fear Somewhat is mischanced here. On your way I'll therefore bring you, And a song or two I'll sing you, Such as I, half in despair, Made when first I woo'd my fair; Whereunto my boy shall play, That my voice assist it may. 1. Come, my Muse, if thou disdain, All my comforts are bereft me; No delight doth now remain, I nor friend nor flock have left me, They are scattered on the plain. Men, alas, are too severe, And make scoffs at lovers' fortunes; Women, hearted like the bear, That regards not who importunes, But doth all in pieces tear. If I should my sorrows show Unto rivers, springs, or fountains, They are senseless of my woe; So are groves, and rocks, and mountains. Then, oh, whither shall I go? Means of harbour me to shield From despair, ah, know you any? For nor city, grange, nor field, Though they lend content to many, Unto me can comfort yield. I have wept and sighed too, For compassion to make trialâ Yea, done all that words can do, Yet have nothing but denial. What way is there then to woo? Shall I swear, protest, and vow? So have I done most extremely. Should I die? I know not how. For from all attempts unseemly, Love and Virtue keeps me now. I have heard that Time prevails; But I fear me 'tis a fable. Time and all endeavour fails; To bear more my heart's unable, Yet none careth what it ails. Lines to some have oped the door, And got entrance for affection. Words well-spoken much implore By the gesture's good direction: But a look doth ten times more. 'Tis the eye that only reads To the heart love's deepest lectures. By a moving look it pleads, More than common-sense conjectures, And a way to pity leads. This I knowing did observe, Both by words and looks complaining, Yet for pity I may starve: There's no hope of my obtaining Till I better can deserve. Yea, and he that thinks to win By desert, may be deceived. For they who have worthiest bin, Of their right have been bereaved, And a groom admitted in. Wherefore, Muse, to thee I call; Thou, since nothing else avails me, Must redeem me from my thrall. If thy sweet enchantment fails me, Then adieu, love, life, and all. 2. Tell me, my heart, what thoughts these pantings move? My thoughts of Love. What flames are these, that set thee so on fire? Flames of Desire. What means hast thou, contentment's flower to crop? No means but Hope. Yet let us feed on Hope, and hope the best. For they amid their griefs are something blest, Whose thoughts, and flames, and means, have such free scope They may at once both Love, Desire, and Hope. But say what fruit will love at last obtain? Fruitless Disdain. What will those hopes prove, which yet seem so fair? Hopeless Despair. What end shall run those passions out of breath? An endless Death. Oh, can there be such cruelty in Love? And doth my fortune so ungentle prove, She will no fruit, nor hope, nor end bequeath, But cruellest Disdain, Despair, and Death? Then what new study shall I now apply? Study to Die. How might I end my care, and die content? Care to Repent. And what good thoughts may make my end more holy? Think on thy Folly. Yes, so I will; and since my fate can give No Hope, but ever without Hope to live, My studies, cares, and thoughts, I'll all apply To weigh my Folly well, Repent and Die. 3. Sad eyes, what do you ail To be thus ill-disposed? Why doth your sleeping fail, Now all men's else are closed? Was't I, that ne'er did bow In any servile duty, And will you make me now A slave to love and beauty? What though thy mistress smile, And in her love affects thee? Let not her eye beguile, I fear she disrespects thee. Do not, poor heart, depend On those vain thoughts that fill thee; They'll fail thee in the end, So must thy passions kill thee. What hopes have I, that she Will hold her favours ever, When so few women be, That constant can persever? Whate'er she do protest, When fortunes do deceive me, Then she, with all the rest, I fear, alas, will leave me. Whilst youth and strength remains, With art that may commend her, Perhaps she nought disdains, Her servant should attend her. But it is one to ten, If crosses overtake me, She will not know me then, But scorn and so forsake me. Shall then in earnest truth My careful eyes observe her? Shall I consume my youth, And short my time to serve her? Shall I, beyond my strength, Let passion's torments prove me, To hear her say at length, Away, I cannot love thee? Oh, rather let me die Whilst I thus gentle find her; 'Twere worse than death if I Should find she proves unkinder. One frown, though but in jest, Or one unkindness feigned, Would rob me of more rest Than e'er could be regained. But in her eyes I find Such signs of pity moving, She cannot be unkind, Nor err, nor fail in loving. And on her forehead this Seems written to relieve me; My heart no joy shall miss That love, or she, can give me. Which if I find, I vow, My service shall persever: The same that I am now, I will continue ever. No other's high degree, Nor beauteous look shall change me. My love shall constant be, And no estate estrange me. When other noble dames By greater men attended, Shall with their lives and names Have all their glories ended, With fairest queens shall she Sit sharing equal glory, And times to come shall be Delighted with our story. In spite of others' hates, More honour I will do her, Than those that with estates And helps of Fortune woo her. Yea, that true worth I spy, Though monarchs strove to grace it, They should not reach more high, Than I dare hope to place it. And though I never vaunt What favours are possessed, Much less content I want, Than if they were expressed. Let others make their mirth To blab each kiss or toying, I know no bliss on earth Like secret love enjoying. And this shall be the worst Of all that can betide me; If I, like some accurst, Should find my hopes deride me, My cares will not be long, I know which way to mend them; I'll think who did the wrong, Sigh, break my heart, and end them. Hail, fair beauties, and again, Hail to all your goodly train. What I promised yesterday, If it please you, hear ye may: For now once begun have I, Sing I will, though none were by. And though freely on I run, Yet confused paths to shun, First that part shall be disclosed, That's of elements composed. There the two unequal pair, Water, fire, earth and air, Each one suiting a complexion, Have so cunning a commixtion, As they, in proportion sweet, With the rarest temper meet. Either inasmuch as needeth, So as neither ought exceedeth. This pure substance is the same, Which the body we do name. Were that of immortal stuff, 'Tis refin'd and pure enough To be call'd a soul; for sure, Many souls are not so pure. I that with a serious look Note of this rare model took, Find that nature in their places So well couched all the graces, As the curious't eyes that be Can nor blot nor blemish see. Like a pine it groweth straight, Reaching an approved height: And hath all the choice perfections, That inflame the best affections. In the motion of each part, Nature seems to strive with Art, Which her gestures most shall bless With the gifts of pleasingness. When she sits, methinks I see How all virtues fixed be In a frame, whose constant mould Will the same unchanged hold. If you note her when she moves, Cytherea drawn with doves May come learn such winning motions As will gain to love's devotions More than all her painted wiles, Such as tears, or sighs, or smiles. Some, whose bodies want true graces, Have sweet features in their faces; Others, that do miss them there, Lovely are some other where; And to our desires do fit, In behaviour, or in wit; Or some inward worth appearing To the soul, the soul endearing: But in her your eye may find All that's good in womankind. What in others we prefer, Are but sundry parts of her; Who most perfect doth present What might one and all content. Yea, he that in love still ranges, And each day, or hourly changes, Had he judgment but to know What perfection in her grow, There would find the spring of store, Swear a faith, and change no more. Neither in the total frame Is she only void of blame; But each part survey'd asunder Might beget both love and wonder. If you dare to look so high, Or behold such majesty, Lift your wond'ring eyes and see Whether ought can better'd be. There's her hair, with which love angles, And beholders' eyes entangles; For, in those fair curled snares, They are hamper'd unawares, And compell'd to swear a duty To her sweet enthralling beauty. In my mind 'tis the most fair That was ever called hair, Somewhat brighter than a brown; And her tresses waving down At full length, and so dispread Mantles her from foot to head. If you saw her arched brow, Tell me, pray, what art knows how To have made it in a line More exact or more divine. Beauty there may be descried In the height of all her pride; 'Tis a meanly-rising plain, Whose pure white hath many a vein, Interlacing like the springs In the earth's enamellings. If the tale be not a toy Of the little winged Boy, When he means to strike a heart, Thence he throws the fatal dart, Which of wounds still makes a pair, One of Love, one of Despair. Round her visageâor so near To a roundness doth appear, That no more of length it takes, Than what best proportion makes. Short her chin is, and yet so As it is just long enow; Loveliness doth seem to glory In that circling promontory. Pretty moving features skip 'Twixt that hillock and the lip, If you note her but the while She is pleased to speak or smile. And her lips, that knew no dullness, Full are, in the meanest fullness; Those the leaves be whose unfolding Brings sweet pleasures to beholding; For such pearls they do disclose, Both the Indies match not those; Yet are so in order placed, As their whiteness is more graced. Each part is so well disposed, And her dainty mouth composed, So as there is no distortion Misbeseems that sweet proportion. When her ivory teeth she buries 'Twixt her two enticing cherries, There appears such pleasures hidden, As might tempt what were forbidden. If you look again, the whiles She doth part those lips in smiles, 'Tis as when a flash of light Breaks from heaven to glad the night. Other parts my pencil crave, But those lips I cannot leave; For methinketh I should go And forsake those cherries so, There's a kind of excellence Holds me from departing hence. I would tell you what it were, But my cunning fails me there. They are like in their discloses To the morning's dewy roses, That beside the name of fair Cast perfumes that sweet the air. Melting soft her kisses be, And had I now two or three, More inspired by their touch, I had prais'd them twice as much. But, sweet Muses, mark ye how Her fair eyes do check me now, That I seem'd to pass them so, And their praises overgo; And yet blame me not, that I Would so fain have pass'd them by; For I feared to have seen them, Lest there were some danger in them. Yet such gentle looks they lend, As might make her foe a friend; And by their allurings move All beholders unto love. Such a power is also there, As will keep those thoughts in fear; And command enough I saw, To hold impudence in awe. There may he, that knows to love, Read contents which are above Their ignoble aims, who know Nothing that so high doth grow. Whilst she me beholding is, My heart dares not think amiss; For her sight most piercing clear, Seems to see what's written there. Those bright eyes, that with their light Oftentimes have blest my sight, And in turning thence their shining Left me in sad darkness pining, Are the rarest, loveliest grey, And do cast forth such a ray, As the man that black prefers, More would like this grey of hers. When their matchless beams she shrouds, 'Tis like Cynthia hid in clouds. If again she show them light, 'Tis like morning after night. And 'tis worthy well beholding, With how many a pretty folding Her sweet eyelids grace that fair, Meanly fring'd with beaming hair; Whereby neatly overspread, Those bright lamps are shadowed. 'Twixt the eyes no hollow place, Wrinkle, nor undecent space, Disproportions her in ought, Though by envy faults were sought. On those eyebrows never yet Did disdainful scowling sit. Love and Goodness gotten thither, Sit on equal thrones together; And do throw just scorn on them That their government contemn. Then, almost obscur'd, appears Those her jewel-gracing ears, Whose own beauties more adorn, Than the richest pearl that's worn By the proudest Persian dames, Or the best that Nature frames. There the voice, in love's meanders, Those their pretty circlings wanders, Whose rare turnings will admit No rude speech to enter it. Stretching from mount forehead lies Beauty's cape betwixt her eyes. Which two crystal-passing lakes Love's delightful isthmus makes; Neither more nor less extending Than most meriteth commending. Those in whom that part hath been Best deserving praises seen, Or, survey'd without affection, Came the nearest to perfection, Would scarce handsome ones appear If with her compared they were. For it is so much excelling, That it passeth means of telling. On the either side of this Love's most lovely prospect is: Those her smiling cheeks, whose colour Comprehends true beauty fuller Than the curious't mixtures can, That are made by art of man. It is beauty's garden-plot, Where as in a true-love knot, So the snowy lily grows, Mixed with the crimson rose, That as friends they joined be. Yet they seem to disagree Whether of the two shall reign, And the lilies oft obtain Greatest sway, unless a blush Help the roses at a push. Hollow fallings none there are; There's no wrinkle, there's no scar; Only there's a little mole, Which from Venus' cheek was stole. If it were a thing in Nature Possible, that any creature Might decaying life repair Only by the help of air, There were no such salve for death As the balm of her sweet breath. Or if any human power Might detain the soul an hour From the flesh to dust bequeathing, It would linger on her breathing, And be half in mind that there More than mortal pleasures were. And whose fortune were so fair As to draw so sweet an air, Would no doubt let slighted lie The perfumes of Araby. For the English eglantine Doth, through envy of her, pine. Violets, and roses too, Fears that she will them undo; And it seems that in her breast Is compos'd the PhÅnix' nest. But descend awhile, mine eye; See if polish'd ivory, Or the finest-fleeced flocks, Or the whitest Albion rocks, For comparisons may stand, To express that snowy hand. When she draws it from her glove It hath virtue to remove, Or disperse 't, if there be ought Cloudeth the beholder's thought. If that palm but toucheth your, You shall feel a secret power Cheer your heart, and glad it more, Though it droop'd with grief before. Through the veins disposed true Crimson yields a sapphire hue, Which adds grace, and more delight, By embracing with the white. Smooth, and moist, and soft, and tender, Are her palms; the fingers slender, Tipp'd with mollified pearl: And if that transformed girl Whose much cunning made her dare With Jove's daughter to compare, Had that hand worn, maugre spite, She had shamed the goddess quite. For there is in every part Nature perfecter than Art. These were joined to those arms That were never made for harms; But possess the sweetest graces, That may apt them for embraces. Like the silver streams they be, Which from some high hill we see Clipping in a goodly vale, That grows proud of such a thrall. Neither alabaster rocks, Pearl-strow'd shores, nor Cotswold flocks, Nor the mountains tipp'd with snow, Nor the milk-white swans of Po, Can appear so fair to me As her spotless shoulders be. They are like some work of state, Cover'd with the richest plate, And a presence have, that strike With devotions, goddess-like. 'Twixt those shoulders, meanly spread, To support that globe-like head, Riseth up her neck, wherein Beauty seemeth to begin To disclose itself in more Tempting manner than before. How therein she doth excel, Though I would, I cannot tell: For I naught on earth espy, That I may express it by. There should lovers, as in duty Hang rich trophies up to beauty. 'Tis proportion'd to a height That is even with delight. Yet it is a great deal higher Than to answer base desire. Where the neck hath end, begins That smooth path where love's close gins Are thick placed to enthral Such as that way straggle shall. There a pleasing passage lies, Far beyond the sight of eyes: And much more delight contains Than the old Elysian plains. Whatsoever others say, There's alone the Milky Way, That to beauty's walks doth go, Which, if others came to know, In possessing their delight, They should never reach the height Of the pleasures which I share, Whilst that those debarred are. Yet unspoken of there rests Her two twin-like lovely breasts, Whose round-rising, pretty panting, I would tell, but art is wanting. Words can never well declare Her fair sweet perfections there: For, would measures give me leave To express what I conceive, I do know I should go near Half to ravish all that hear. And, but that I learn to season What I apprehend with reason, It had made my passions' weight Sink me through my own conceit. There I find so large a measure Of an unexpressed pleasure, That my heart, through strong surmise, In a pleasing fainting lies. He that there may rest to prove, Softer finds those beds of love, Than the cotton ripest grown, Or fine pillows of such down, As in time of moulting, fans From the breasts of silver swans. Those two sisters are a pair Smooth alike, like soft, like fair, If together they be view'd. Yet if they apart be shew'd, That you touch, or see, seems smoother, Softer, fairer, than the other. That the colour may delight, So much red as makes the white Purer seem, is shed among: And then here and there along Runs a sapphire-mine, whose blue, Shadow'd, makes so brave a show On those lily mounts, as tho' Beauty's simples there did grow. In the vale, 'twixt either hill, Lies desire in ambush still; And surpriseth every eye Which doth that way dare to pry. There is sure the twy-top hill Where the poets learn their skill. That's Parnassus where the Muses Chaste and wise Minerva uses. Her two cherrilets are those, Whence the pleasant'st nectar flows: And no fruits e'er equall'd these, Fetch'd from the Hesperides. Once, as Cynthia's games she chased, And for air left half unlaced Her light summer robe of green, Beauty's safe but slender screen, Unawares I partly spied That fair lily field unhid, Which you may her belly name; Yet nor she nor I to blame, For it was but what mine eye Might behold with modesty. 'Tis a fair and matchless plain Where unknown delights remain; 'Tis the store-house wherein pleasure Hides the richest of her treasure; Which true modesty in ward Keeps with a continual guard Of such virtues as she's sure No corruption can allure. There, they say, for mind it well, I do this by hearsay tell, Grows her navel, which doth seem Like some jewel of esteem; With so wondrous cunning wrought That an injury 'tis thought Such a beauty, with the rest, Should, unknown, be unexprest. Somewhat else there is, that's hidden, Which to name I am forbidden: Neither have I ever pried After that should be unspied. Never shall my maiden Muse So herself and me abuse, As to sing what I may fear Will offend the choicest ear. Though I know, if none be by But true friends to modesty, I might name each part at will, And yet no man's thought be ill. Yet, for fear loose hearers may Judge amiss, if more I say, I'll descend to shun all blame, To the pillars of this frame; Where, though I ne'er aim'd so high As her dainty youthful thighâ Whose rare softness, smoothness, fullness, Being known, would teach my dullness Such a strain as might befit Some brave Tuscan poet's witâ Once a saucy bush I spied, Pluck her silken skirts aside; So discover'd unto me All those beauties to the knee. And, before the thorns' entanglings Had let go the silver spanglings, I perceived the curious knitting Of those joints were well befitting; Such a noble piece of work, 'Mongst whose turnings seem'd to lurk Much to entertain the sight With new objects of delight. Then the leg for shape as rare, Will admit of no compare. Straight it is; the ankle lean, Full the calf, but in the mean; And the slender foot doth fit, So each way to suit with it, As she nothing less excels Therein, than in all things else. Yea, from head to foot her feature Shows her an unblemish'd creature: In whom love with reason might Find so matchless a delight, That more cannot be acquired, Nor a greater bliss desired. Yet if you will rest an hour Under yonder shady bower, I anon my Muse will raise To a higher pitch of praise. But awhile with raspice-berries, Strawberries, ripe pears, and cherries (Such as these our groves do bear), We will cool our palates there. And those homely cates among, Now and then a past'ral song Shall my lad here sing and play, Such as you had yesterday. 1. A lad whose faith will constant prove, And never know an end, Late by an oversight in love, Displeas'd his dearest friend. For which incens'd, she did retake The favours which he wore, And said he never for her sake Should wear or see them more. The grief whereof, how near it went, And how unkindly took, Was figur'd by the discontent Appearing in his look. At first he could not silence break, So heavy sorrow lay, But when his sighs gave way to speak, Thus sadly did he say: âMy only dear;â and with that speech, Not able to sustain The floods of grief at sorrow's breach, He paus'd awhile again. At length, nigh fainting, did express These words, with much ado: âOh, dear, let not my love's excess Me and my love undo.â She, little moved with his pain, His much distraction eyed; And changing love into disdain, Thus, still unkind, replied: âForbear to urge one kindness more, Unless you long to see The good respect you had before At once all lost in me.â With that, dismay'd, his suit he ceased, And down his head he hung; And as his reason's strength decreased, His passion grew more strong. But, seeing she did slight his moan, With willow garlands wreath'd, He sat him down, and all alone This sad complaint he breath'd: âOh heavens!â quoth he, âwhy do we spend Endeavours thus in vain; Since what the Fates do fore-intend, They never change again? Nor faith, nor love, nor true desert, Nor all that man can do, Can win him place within her heart, That is not born thereto. âWhy do I fondly waste my youth In secret sighs and tears? Why to preserve a spotless truth, Taste I so many cares? For women, that no worth respect, Do so ungentle prove, That some shall win by their neglect What others lose with love. âThose that have set the best at naught, And no man could enjoy, At last by some base gull are caught, And gotten with a toy. Yea, they that spend an age's light, Their favours to obtain, For one unwilling oversight May lose them all again. âHow glad, and fain, alas! would I For her have underwent The greatest care, ere she should try The smallest discontent? Yet she that may my life command, And doth those passions know, Denieth me a poor demand, In height of all my woe. âOh, if the noblest of her time, And best beloved of me, Could for so poor, so slight a crime, So void of pity be, Sure, had it been some common one Whose patience I had tried, No wonder I had been undone, Or unforgiven died. âA thousand lives I would have laid, So well I once believed She would have deign'd to lend me aid, If she had seen me grieved. But now I live to see the day Where I presumed so, I neither dare for pity pray, Nor tell her of my woe. âYet let not, poor despised heart, Her worth ought question'd be Hadst thou not failed in desert, She had not failed thee. But lest, perhaps, they flout thy moan, That should esteem thee dear, Go, make it by thyself alone, Where none may come to hear. âStill keep thy forehead crown'd with smiles, What passion e'er thou try, That none may laugh at thee, the whiles Thou discontented lie. And let no wrong by chance disdain A love so truly fair, But rather never hope again, And thou shalt ne'er despair.â 2. O'ertired by cruel passions that oppress me, With heart nigh broken, time no hope would give me, Upon my bed I laid me down to rest me; And gentle sleep I wooed to relieve me. But oh, alas! I found that on the morrow My sleeping joys brought forth my waking sorrow. For lo! a dream I had so full of pleasure, That to possess what to embrace I seem'd Could not affect my joy in higher measure Than now it grieves me that I have but dream'd. Oh, let my dreams be sighs and tears hereafter, So I that sleeping weep, may wake in laughter. Fain would I tell how much that shadow pleased me; But tongue and pen want words and art in telling: Yet this I'll say, to show what horror seized me When I was robb'd of bliss, so much excelling: Might all my dreams be such, oh, let me never Awake again, but sleep and dream for ever. For when I waking saw myself deceived, And what an inward Hell it had procured, To find myself of all my hopes bereaved, It brought on passions not to be endured: And knew I next night had such dreams in keeping, I'd make my eyes forswear for ever sleeping. 3. You woody hills, you dales, you groves, You floods, and every spring, You creatures, come, whom nothing moves, And hear a shepherd sing. For to heroÃ«s, nymphs, and swains, I long have made my moan; Yet what my mournful verse contains Is understood of none. In song Apollo gave me skill; Their love his sisters deign: With those that haunt Parnassus' hill I friendship entertain: Yet this is all in vain to me, So haplessly I fare, As those things which my glory be My cause of ruin are. For Love hath kindled in my breast His never-quenched fire: And I, who often have exprest What other men desire, Because I could so dive into The depth of others' moan, Now I my own affliction show, I heeded am of none. Oft have the nymphs of greatest worth Made suit my songs to hear: As oft, when I have sighed forth Such notes as saddest were, âAlas!â said they, âpoor gentle heart, Whoe'er that shepherd be:â But none of them suspects my smart, Nor thinks it meaneth me. When I have reach'd so high a strain Of passion in my song, That they have seen the tears to rain And trill my cheek along, Instead of sigh, or weeping eye, To sympathize with me, âOh, were he once in love,â they cry, âHow moving would he be!â Oh, pity me, you powers above, And take my skill away; Or let my hearers think I love, And feign not what I say: For if I could disclose the smart Which I unknown do bear, Each line would make them sighs impart, And every word a tear. âHad I a mistress,â some do think, âShe should revealed be; And I would favours wear, or drink Her health upon my knee.â Alas, poor fools! they aim awry, Their fancy flags too low: Could they my love's rare course espy, They would amazed grow. But let nor nymph nor swain conceive My tongue shall ever tell Who of this rest doth me bereave, Or where I am not well. But if you sighing me espy, Where rarest features be, Mark where I fix a weeping eye, And swear you, there is she. Yet, ere my eyes betray me shall, I'll swell and burst with pain: And for each drop they would let fall, My heart shall bleed me twain. For since my soul more sorrow bears Than common lovers know, I scorn my passions should, like theirs, A common humour show. Ear never heard of, heretofore, Of any love like mine. Nor shall there be for evermore Affection so divine. And that to feign it none may try, When I dissolv'd must be, The first I am it lived by, And die it shall with me. Boy, ha' done; for now my brain Is inspir'd afresh again, And new raptures pressing are, To be sung in praise of her, Whose fair picture lieth nigh, Quite unveil'd to every eye. No small favour hath it been That such beauty might be seen: Therefore, ever may they rue it, Who with evil eyes shall view it. Yea, what ancient stories tell, Once to rude ActÃ¦on fell, When with evil thoughts he stood Eyeing Cynthia in the flood, May that fatal horned curse Light upon them, or a worse. But, whatever others be, Lest some fault be found in me, If unperfect this remain, I will over-trim 't again. Therefore, turn where we begun: And now all is overrun, Mark if everything exprest Suit not so unto the rest, As if Nature would prefer All perfections unto her. Wherefore seems it strange to any That they daily see so many, Who were else most perfect creatures, In some one part want true features? Since, from all the fair'st that live, Nature took the best, to give Her perfection in each part. I alone except her heart; For, among all woman-kind, Such as hers is hard to find. If you truly note her face, You shall find it hath a grace Neither wanton, nor o'er-serious, Nor too yielding, nor imperious; But with such a feature blest, It is that which pleaseth best, And delights each sev'ral eye, That affects with modesty. Lowliness hath in her look Equal place with greatness took; And if beauty anywhere Claims prerogatives, 'tis there; For at once thus much 'twill do, Threat, command, persuade, and woo. In her speech there is not found Any harsh, unpleasing sound, But a well-beseeming power, Neither higher, neither lower, Than will suit with her perfection; 'Tis the loadstone of affection; And that man, whose judging eyes Could well sound such mysteries, Would in love make her his choice, Though he did but hear her voice. For such accents breathe not, whence Beauty keeps non-residence. Never word of hers I hear But 'tis music to mine ear, And much more contentment brings Than the sweetly-touched strings Of the pleasing lute, whose strains Ravish hearers when it plains. Raised by her discourse, I fly In contented thoughts so high, That I pass the common measures Of the dulled senses' pleasures, And leave far below my flight Vulgar pitches of delight. If she smile, and merry be, All about her are as she, For each looker-on takes part Of the joy that's in her heart. If she grieve, or you but spy Sadness peeping through her eye, Such a grace it seems to borrow, That you'll fall in love with sorrow, And abhor the name of mirth As the hateful'st thing on earth. Should I see her shed a tear, My poor eyes would melt, I fear. For much more in hers appears, Than in other women's tears; And her look did never feign Sorrow where there was no pain. Seldom hath she been espied So impatient as to chide: For if any see her so, They'll in love with anger grow. Sigh, or speak, or smile, or talk, Sing, or weep, or sit, or walk, Everything that she doth do Decent is, and lovely too. Each part that you shall behold Hath within itself enrolled What you could desire to see, Or your heart conceive to be. Yet if from that part your eye Moving, shall another spy, There you see as much or more Than you thought to praise before. While the eye surveys it, you Will imagine that her brow Hath all beauty; when her cheek You behold, it is as like To be deemed fairest too, So much there can beauty do. Look but thence upon her eye, And you wonder, by and by, How there may be anywhere So much worthy praise as there. Yet if you survey her breast, Then as freely you'll protest That in them perfection is; Though I know that one poor kiss From her tempting lips would then Make all that forsworn again. For the selfsame moving grace Is at once in every place. She her beauty never foils With your ointments, waters, oils, Nor no loathsome fucus settles, Mix'd with Jewish fasting spittles. Fair by nature being born, She doth borrow'd beauty scorn; Whoso kisses her needs fear No unwholesome varnish there; For from thence he only sips The pure nectar of her lips, And at once with these he closes Melting rubies, cherries, roses. Then in her behaviour she Striveth but herself to be; Keeping such a decent state, As indeed she seems to hate Precious leisure should be spent In abused compliment. Though she knows what other do, And can all their courtship too, She is not in so ill case, As to need their borrow'd grace. Her discourses sweeten'd are With a kind of artless care, That expresseth greater art Than affected words impart. So her gestures, being none But that freeness which alone Suits the braveness of her mind, Make her, of herself, to find Postures more becoming far Than the mere acquired are. If you mark when for her pleasure She vouchsafes to foot a measure, Though with others' skill she pace, There's a sweet delightful grace In herself, which doth prefer Art beyond that art in her. Neither needs she beat her wit To devise what dressings fit. Her complexion, and her feature, So beholding are to Nature, If she in the fashions go, All the reason she doth so Is because she would not err In appearing singular: Doubtless not for any thought That 'twill perfect her in ought. Many a dainty-seeming dame Is in native beauties lame. Some are graced by their tires, As their quoifs, their hats, their wires. One a ruff doth best become; Falling-bands much alt'reth some. And their favours oft we see Changed as their dressings be: Which her beauty never fears, For it graceth all she wears. If ye note her tire to-day, That doth suit her best, you'll say. Mark what she next morn doth wear; That becomes her best, you'll swear. Yea, as oft as her you see, Such new graces still there be, As she ever seemeth grac'd Most by that she weareth last, Though it be the same she wore But the very day before. When she takes her tires about her (Never half so rich without her), At the putting on of them, You may liken every gem To those lamps which at a play Are set up to light the day; For their lustre adds no more To what Titan gave before, Neither doth their pretty gleamings Hinder ought his greater beamings; And yet, which is strange to me, When those costly deckings be Laid away, there seems descried Beauties which those veils did hide; And she looks as doth the moon Past some cloud through which she shone; Or some jewel watch, whose case, Set with diamonds, seems to grace What it doth contain within, Till the curious work be seen; Then 'tis found that costly shrining Did but hinder t'other's shining. If you chance to be in place When her mantle she doth grace, You would presently protest Irish dressings were the best. If again she lay it down, While you view her in a gown, And how those her dainty limbs That close-bodied garment trims, You would swear, and swear again, She appeared loveliest then. But if she so truly fair Should untie her shining hair And at length that treasure shed, Jove's endured Ganimed, Neither Cytherea's joy, Nor the sweet self-loving boy Who in beauty did surpass, Nor the fair'st that ever was, Could, to take you prisoner, bring Looks so sweetly conquering. She excels her whom Apollo Once with weeping eyes did follow; Or that nymph who, shut in towers, Was beguil'd with golden showers; Yea, and she, whose love was wont To swim o'er the Hellespont For her sake, though in attire Fittest to inflame desire, Seem'd not half so fair to be, Nor so lovely as is she. For the man whose happy eye Views her in full majesty, Knows she hath a power that moves More than doth the Queen of Loves, When she useth all her power To inflame her paramour. And sometime I do admire All men burn not with desire. Nay, I muse her servants are not Pleading love; but oh, they dare not: And I therefore wonder why They do not grow sick and die. Sure they would do so, but that By the ordinance of Fate, There is some concealed thing So each gazer limiting, He can see no more of merit Than beseems his worth and spirit. For in her a grace there shines, That o'er-daring thoughts confines, Making worthless men despair To be loved of one so fair. Yea, the destinies agree, Some good judgments blind should be, And not gain the power of knowing Those rare beauties in her growing. Reason doth as much imply: For, if every judging eye Which beholdeth her should there Find what excellences are, All, o'ercome by those perfections, Would be captive to affections. So, in happiness unblest, She for lovers should not rest. This, well heeding, think upon: And, if there be any one Who alloweth not the worth Which my Muse hath painted forth, Hold it no defect in her, But that he's ordain'd to err. Or if any female wight Should detract from this I write, She, I yield, may show her wit, But disparage her no whit; For on earth few women be, That from Envy's touch are free; And who ever Envy knew Yield those honours that were due? Though sometimes my song I raise To unused heights of praise, And break forth as I shall please Into strange hyperboles, 'Tis to show conceit hath found Worth beyond expression's bound. Though her breath I do compare To the sweet'st perfumes that are; Or her eyes, that are so bright, To the morning's cheerful light; Yet I do it not so much To infer that she is such, As to show that being blest With what merits name of best, She appears more fair to me Than all creatures else that be. Her true beauty leaves behind Apprehensions in my mind, Of more sweetness than all art, Or inventions can impart; Thoughts too deep to be expressed, And too strong to be suppressed; Which oft raiseth my conceits To so unbelieved heights, That I fear some shallow brain Thinks my Muses do but feign. Sure, he wrongs them if he do: For, could I have reached to So like strains as these you see, Had there been no such as she? Is it possible that I, Who scarce heard of poesy, Should a mere Idea raise To as true a pitch of praise As the learned poets could, Now, or in the times of old, All those real beauties bring Honour'd by their sonnetingâ Having arts, and favours too, More t'encourage what they do? No; if I had never seen Such a beauty, I had been Piping in the country shades To the homely dairymaids, For a country fiddler's fees, Clouted cream, and bread and cheese. I no skill in numbers had, More than every shepherd's lad, Till she taught me strains that were Pleasing to her gentle ear. Her fair splendour and her worth From obscureness drew me forth; And, because I had no Muse, She herself deign'd to infuse All the skill by which I climb To these praises in my rhyme: Which if she had pleased to add To that art sweet Drayton had; Or that happy swain that shall Sing Britannia's Pastoral; Or to theirs, whose verse set forth Rosalind and Stella's worth; They had doubled all their skill Gained on Apollo's hill, And as much more set her forth, As I'm short of them in worth. They had unto heights aspired, Might have justly been admired; And in such brave strains had moved As of all had been approved. I must praise her as I may; Which I do mine own rude way: Sometime setting forth her glories By unheard-of allegories. Think not, though, my Muse now sings Mere absurd or feigned things. If to gold I like her hair, Or to stars her eyes so fair; Though I praise her skin by snow, Or by pearls her double row, 'Tis that you might gather thence Her unmatched excellence. Eyes as fair for eyes hath she As stars fair for stars may be; And each part as fair doth show, In it kind, as white in snow. 'Tis no grace to her at all If her hair I sunbeams call: For, were there a power in art So to portrait every part, All men might those beauties see As they do appear to me. I would scorn to make compare With the glorious't things that are. Nought I e'er saw fair enow But the hair, the hair to show. Yet some think him overbold That compares it but to gold. He from reason seems to err, Who, commending of his dear, Gives her lips the ruby's hue, Or by pearls her teeth doth show. But what pearls, what rubies can Seem so lovely fair to man, As her lips whom he doth love, When in sweet discourse they move, Or her lovelier teeth, the while She doth bless him with a smile? Stars indeed fair creatures be, Yet amongst us where is he Joys not more the while he lies Sunning in his mistress' eyes, Than in all the glimmering light Of a starry winter's night? Him to flatter most suppose, That prefers before the rose Or the lilies, while they grow, Or the flakes of new-fall'n snow, Her complexion whom he loveth; And yet this my Muse approveth. For, in such a beauty, meets Unexpressed moving sweets, That the like unto them no man Ever saw but in a woman. Look on moon, on stars, on sun, All God's creatures overrun, See if all of them presents To your mind such sweet contents; Or, if you from them can take Ought that may a beauty make, Shall one half so pleasing prove, As is hers whom you do love? For indeed, if there had been Other mortal beauties seen, Objects for the love of man, Vain was their creation than. Yea, if this could well be granted, Adam might his Eve have wanted. But a woman is the creature Whose proportion with our nature Best agrees, and whose perfections Sympathize with our affections, And not only finds our senses Pleasure in their excellences, But our reason also knows Sweetness in them, that outgoes Human wit to comprehend, Much more, truly, to commend. Note the beauty of an eye; And if ought you praise it by Leave such passion in your mind, Let my reason's eye be blind. Mark if ever red or white Anywhere gave such delight As when they have taken place In a worthy woman's face. He that so much hath not noted, Will not, or is grown besotted. Such as lovers are conceive What impressions beauty leave And those hearts that fire have took By a love-inflaming look, Those believe what here I say, And suppose not that I stray In a word, by setting forth Any praise beyond true worth. And yet, wherefore should I care What another's censures are, Since I know her to be such As no praise can be too much? All that see her will agree In the self-same mind with me, If their wit be worth the having, Or their judgment merit craving. And the man that kens her not, Speaks, at best, he knows not what: So his envy or good will, Neither doth her good nor ill. Then fools' cavils I disdain, And call back my Muse again To decipher out the rest, For I have too long digressed. This is she, in whom there meets All variety of sweets. An epitome of all That on earth we fair may call. Nay, yet more I dare aver: He that is possess'd of her, Shall at once all pleasure find, That is reap'd from womankind. Oh, what man would further range, That in one might find such change? What dull eye such worth can see, And not sworn a lover be? Or from whence was he, could prove Such a monster in his love, As in thought to use amiss Such unequall'd worth as this? Pity 'twere that such a creature, PhÅnix-like for matchless feature, Should so suffer, or be blamed With what now the times are shamed. Beauty, unto me divine, Makes my honest thoughts incline Unto better things than that Which the vulgar aimeth at. And, I vow, I grieve to see Any fair and false to be; Or when I sweet pleasures find Match'd with a defiled mind. But above all others her So much doth my soul prefer, That to him, whose ill desire Should so nurse a lawless fire As to tempt to that which might Dim her sacred virtue's light, I could wish that he might die Ere he did it, though 'twere I. For if she should hap to stray, All this beauty would away, And not her alone undo, But kill him that prais'd her, too. But I know her Maker will Keep her undistained still, That ensuing ages may Pattern out by her the way To all goodness; and if Fate That appoints all things a date Hear me would, I'd wish that she Might for aye preserved be. And that neither wasting cares, Neither all-consuming years, Might from what she is estrange her, Or in mind or body change her. For oh, why should envious Time Perpetrate so vile a crime As to waste, or wrong, or stain, What shall ne'er be match'd again? Much I hope it shall not be: For, if Love deceive not me, To that height of fair she grows, Age or sickness, beauty's foes, Cannot so much wrong it there, But enough there will appear, Ever worthy to be loved; And that heart shall more be moved, Where there is a judging eye, With those prints it doth espy Of her beauty wrong'd by Time, Than by others in their prime. One advantage she hath more, That adds grace to all before. It is thisâher beauty's fame Hath not done her honour shame. For where beauty we do find, Envy still is so unkind That although their virtues are Such as pass their beauties far, Yet on slander's rocks they be Shipwreck'd oftentimes, we see; And are subject to the wrongs Of a thousand spiteful tongues, When the greatest fault they had Was that some would make them bad, And not finding them for action, Sought for vengeance by detraction. But her beauty sure no tongue Is so villainous to wrong. Never did the jealous't ear Any muttering rumour hear That might cause the least suspects Of indifferent defects. And, which somewhat stranger is, They whose slanders few can miss, Though set on by evil will And habituated ill, Nothing can of her invent Whence to frame disparagement; Which, if we respect the crimes Of these loose injurious times, Doth not only truly prove Great discretion in her love, And that she hath liv'd upright In each jealous tongue's despite, But it must be understood That her private thoughts are good. Yea, 'tis an apparent sign That her beauty is divine: And that angels have a care Men's polluting tongues should spare To defile what God hath given To be dear to earth and heaven. Tell me, you that hear me now, Is there any one of you Wanteth feeling of affection, Or that loves not such perfection? Can there be so dull an ear As of so much worth to hear, And not seriously incline To this saint-like friend of mine? If there be, the fault doth lie In my artless poesy. For if I could reach the strain Which methinks I might obtain, Or but make my measures fly, Equal with my fantasy, I would not permit an ear To attend unravish'd here, If but so much sense it knew As the blocks that Orpheus drew. Think on this description well, And your noblest ladies tell; Which of you, that worth can see, This my mistress would not be? You brave English, who have run From the rising of the sun, Till in travelling you found Where he doth conclude his round; You, that have the beauties seen, Which in farthest lands have been; And survey'd the fair resorts Of the French and Spanish courts, With the best that fame renowns In the rich trans-Alpine towns, Do not, with our brainless fry That admire each novelty, Wrong your country's fame in ought But here freely speak your thought; And I durst presume you'll swear She's not matched anywhere. Gallants, you that would so fain Nymphs' and ladies' loves obtain, You that strive to serve and please Fairest queens and empresses, Tell me this and tell me right, If you would not, so you might, Leave them all despis'd, to prove What contents are in her love? Could your fathers ever tell Of a nymph did more excel? Or hath any story told Of the like, in times of old? Dido was not such a one, Nor the Trojan's paragon, Though they so much favour found, As to have their honours crown'd By the best of poets' pens, Ever known before, or since. For had Dido been so fair, Old Anchises' noble heir Jove's command had disobeyed, And with her in Carthage stayed, Where he would have quite forswore Seeing the Lavinian shore. Or, had Leda's daughter been, When she was the Spartan queen, Equal with this lovely one, Menelaus had never gone From her sight so far away As to leave her for a prey, And his room to be possest By her wanton Phrygian guest. But lest yet among you some Think she may behind these come, Stay a little more and hear me, In another strain I'll rear me. I'll unmask a beauty, now, Which to kiss the gods may bow, And so feelingly did move, That your souls shall fall in love. I have yet the best behind: Her most fair, unequall'd mind. This that I have here expressed Is but that which veils the rest, An incomparable shrine, Of a beauty more divine. Whereof ere I farther speak, Off again my song I'll break, And if you among the roses, Which yon quickset hedge encloses, Will with plucking flowers beguile Tedious-seeming time awhile, Till I step to yonder green, Whence the sheep so plain are seen, I will be returned ere You an hour have stay'd there. And excuse me now, I pray, Though I rudely go away, For affairs I have to do, Which, unless I look into, I may sing out summer here Like the idle grasshopper, And at winter hide my head, Or else fast till I am dead. Yet if rustic past'ral measures Can aught add unto your pleasures, I will leave you some of those Which it pleas'd me to compose When despairing fits were over, And I, made a happy lover, Exercis'd my loving passion In another kind of fashion Than to utter I devised, When I feared to be despised. Those shall lie in gage for me Till I back returned be, And in writing here you have them; Either sing, or read, or leave them. SONNET 1. Admire not, shepherd's boy, Why I my pipe forbear; My sorrows and my joy Beyond expression are. Though others may In songs display Their passions, when they woo, Yet mine do fly A pitch too high For words to reach unto. If such weak thoughts as those With others' fancies move, Or if my breast did close But common strains of love, Or passion's store Learned me no more To feel than others do, I'd paint my cares As black as theirs, And teach my lines to woo. But oh! thrice happy ye Whose mean conceit is dull, You from those thoughts are free That stuff my breast so full: My love's excess Lets to express What songs are used to, And my delights Take such high flights, My joys will me undo. I have a love that's fair, Rich, wise, and nobly born; She's true perfection's heir, Holds nought but vice in scorn. A heart to find More chaste, more kind, Our plains afford no moe; Of her degree No blab I'll be, For doubt some prince should woo. And yet I do not fear, Though she my meanness knows, The willow branch to wear, No, nor the yellow hose. For if great Jove Should sue for love, She would not me forego; Resort I may By night or day, Which braver dare not do. You gallants, born to pelf, To lands, to titles' store, I'm born but to myself, Nor do I care for more. Add to your earth, Wealth, honours, birth, And all you can thereto, You cannot prove That height of love Which I in meanness do. Great men have helps to gain Those favours they implore; Which, though I win with pain, I find my joys the more. Each clown may rise, And climb the skies, When he hath found a stair: But joy to him That dares to climb, And hath no help but air. Some say that love repents Where fortunes disagree; I know the high'st contents From low beginnings be. My love's unfeigned To her that deigned From greatness stoop thereto; She loves 'cause I, So mean, dared try Her better worth to woo. And yet, although much joy My fortune seems to bless, 'Tis mix'd with more annoy Than I shall e'er express: For with much pain Did I obtain The gem I'll ne'er forego, Which yet I dare Nor show, nor wear, And that breeds all my woe. But fie, my foolish tongue, How loosely now it goes! First let my knell be rung, Ere I do more disclose. Mount thoughts on high, Cease words, for why My meaning to divine, To those I leave That can conceive So brave a love as mine. And now no more I'll sing Among my fellow swains; Nor groves nor hills shall ring With echoes of my plains. My measures be Confused, you see, And will not suit thereto; 'Cause I have more Brave thoughts in store Than words can reach unto. SONNET 2. Hence, away, you Sirens, leave me, And unclasp your wanton arms; Sugar'd words shall ne'er deceive me, Though thou prove a thousand charms; Fie, fie, forbear; No common snare Could ever my affection chain: Your painted baits And poor deceits Are all bestow'd on me in vain. I'm no slave to such as you be; Neither shall a snowy breast, Wanton eye, or lip of ruby, Ever rob me of my rest. Go, go, display Your beauty's ray To some o'er-soon enamour'd swain. Those common wiles Of sighs and smiles Are all bestow'd on me in vain. I have elsewhere vow'd a duty; Turn away thy tempting eyes. Show not me a naked beauty, Those impostures I despise. My spirit loathes Where gaudy clothes And feigned oaths may love obtain. I love her so, Whose look swears no, That all your labours will be vain. Can he prize the tainted posies Which on every breast are worn, That may pluck the spotless roses From their never-touched thorn? I can go rest On her sweet breast, That is the pride of Cynthia's train: Then hold your tongues, Your mermaid songs Are all bestow'd on me in vain. He's a fool that basely dallies Where each peasant mates with him. Shall I haunt the thronged valleys Whilst there's noble hills to climb? No, no; though clowns Are scared with frowns, I know the best can but disdain: And those I'll prove; So shall your love Be all bestow'd on me in vain. Yet I would not deign embraces With the greatest, fairest she, If another shared those graces Which had been bestow'd on me. I gave that one My love where none Shall come to rob me of my gain. Your fickle hearts Makes tears and arts And all bestow'd on me in vain. I do scorn to vow a duty Where each lustful lad may woo. Give me her whose sun-like beauty Buzzards dare not soar unto. She, she it is Affords that bliss For which I would refuse no pain. But such as you, Fond fools, adieu; You seek to captive me in vain. Proud she seem'd in the beginning, And disdained my looking on; But that coy one in the winning Proves a true one being won. Whate'er betide She'll ne'er divide The favour she to me shall deign. But your fond love Will fickle prove, And all that trust in you are vain. Therefore know, when I enjoy one, And for love employ my breath, She I court shall be a coy one, Though I win her with my death. A favour there Few aim at dare. And if, perhaps, some lover plain, She is not won, Nor I undone, By placing of my love in vain. Leave me then, you Sirens, leave me, Seek no more to work my harms; Crafty wiles cannot deceive me, Who am proof against your charms. You labour may To lead astray The heart that constant shall remain, And I the while Will sit and smile To see you spend your time in vain. SONNET 3. When Philomela with her strains The spring had welcomed in, And Flora to bestrow the plains With daisies did begin, My love and I, on whom suspicious eyes Had set a thousand spies, To cozen Argus strove; And seen of none We got alone Into a shady grove. On every bush the eglantine, With leaves perfumed hung, The primrose made the hedgerows fine, The woods of music rung. The earth, the air, and all things did conspire To raise contentment higher; That, had I come to woo, Nor means of grace, Nor time, nor place, Were wanting thereunto. With hand in hand alone we walked, And oft each other eyed; Of love and passions past we talked, Which our poor hearts had tried. Our souls infus'd into each other were: And what may be her care, Did my more sorrow breed; One mind we bore, One faith we swore, And both in one agreed. Her dainty palm I gently prest, And with her lips I play'd; My cheek upon her panting breast, And on her neck I laid. And yet we had no sense of wanton lust: Nor did we then mistrust The poison in the sweet; Our bodies wrought So close, we thought, Because our souls should meet. With pleasant toil we breathless grew, And kiss'd in warmer blood; Upon her lips the honey-dew Like drops on roses stood; And on those flowers play'd I the busy bee, Whose sweets were such to me, Them could I not forego. No, not to feast On Venus' breast, Whence streams of sweetness flow. But kissing and embracing we So long together lay, Her touches all inflamed me, And I began to stray. My hands presum'd so far, they were too bold; My tongue unwisely told How much my heart was changed. And virtue quite Was put to flight, Or for the time estranged. Oh! what are we, if in our strength We over-boldly trust? The strongest forts will yield at length, And so our virtues must. In me no force of reason had prevailed If she had also failed; But ere I further strayed, She sighing kissed My naked wrist, And thus in tears she said: âSweetheart,â quoth she, âif in thy breast Those virtues real be, Which hitherto thou hast profest, And I believed in thee, Thyself and me, oh, seek not to abuse. Whilst thee I thus refuse In hotter flames I fry; Yet let us not Our true love spot, Oh, rather let me die. âFor if thy heart should fall from good, What would become of mine? As strong a passion stirs my blood, As can distemper thine. Yet in my breast this rage I smother would, Though it consume me should, And my desires contain: For where we see Such breaches be, They seldom stop again. âAre we the two that have so long Each other's loves embraced? And never did affection wrong, Nor think a thought unchaste? And shall, oh, shall we now our matchless joy For one poor touch destroy, And all content forego? Oh no, my dear; Sweetheart, forbear; I will not lose thee so. âFor, should we do a deed so base, As it can never be, I could no more have seen thy face, Nor would'st thou look on me. I should of all our passions grow ashamed, And blush when thou art named; Yea, though thou constant wert, I being nought, A jealous thought Would still torment my heart. âWhat goodly thing do we obtain If I consent to thee? Rare joys we lose, and what we gain But common pleasures be: Yea, those, some say, who are to lust inclin'd, Drive love out of the mind; And so much reason miss, That they admire What kind of fire A chaste affection is. âNo vulgar bliss I aimed at When first I heard thee woo; I'll never prize a man for that Which every groom can do. If that be love, the basest men that be Do love as well as we, Who, if we bear us well, Do pass them then, As angels men In glory do excel.â Whilst thus she spake a cruel band Of passions seized my soul, And what one seemed to command, Another did control. 'Twixt good and ill I did divided lie. But as I raised mine eye, In her methought I saw Those virtues shine Whose rays divine First gave desire a law. With that I felt the blush of shame Into my cheeks return; And love did with a chaster flame Within my bosom burn. My soul her light of reason had renew'd; And by those beams I view'd How slyly lust ensnares: And all the fires Of ill desires I quenched with my tears. Go, wantons, now, and flout at this My coldness, if you list; Vain fools, you never knew the bliss That doth in love consist. You sigh, and weep, and labour to enjoy A shade, a dream, a toy; Poor folly you pursue; And are unblessed, Since every beast In pleasure equals you. You never took so rich content, In all your wanton play, As this to me hath pleasure lent, That chaste she went away. For as some sins which we committed have, Sharp stings behind them leave, Whereby we vexed are, So ill suppressed Begetteth rest And peace without compare. But lest this conquest slight you make, Which on myself I won, Twelve labours I will undertake With Jove's victorious son, Ere I will such another brunt endure. For, had Diana pure Thus tempted been to sin, That queen of night, With her chaste light, Had scarce a maiden bin. Oh! how honoured are my songs, Graced by your melodious tongues! And how pleasing do they seem, Now your voices carol them! Were not yet that task to do, Which my word enjoins me to, I should beg of you to hear What your own inventions were. But before I ought will crave, What I promised you shall have. And as I on mortal creatures Call'd, to view her body's features, Showing how to make the senses Apprehend her excellences, Now I speak of no worse subject Than a soul's and reason's object: And relate a beauty's glories, Fitting heavenly auditories. Therefore, whilst I sit and sing, Hem me, angels, in a ring; Come, ye spirits, which have eyes That can gaze on deities, And unclogg'd with brutish senses, Comprehend such excellences. Or, if any mortal ear Would be granted leave to hear, And find profit with delight In what now I shall indite, Let him first be sure to season A prepared heart with reason: And with judgment drawing nigh, Lay all fond affections by. So, through all her veilings, he Shall the soul of beauty see. But avoid, you earth-bred wights, Cloy'd with sensual appetites: On base objects glut your eyes, Till your starveling pleasure dies: Feed your ears with such delights, As may match your gross conceits: For, within your muddy brain, These you never can contain. Think not, you who by the sense Only judge of excellence, Or do all contentment place In the beauty of a face, That these higher thoughts of our Soar so base a pitch as your. I can give, as well as you, Outward beauties all their due: I can most contentments see, That in love or women be. Though I dote not on the features Of our daintiest female creatures, Nor was e'er so void of shames As to play their lawless games, I more prize a snowy hand Than the gold on Tagus' strand, And a dainty lip before All the greatest monarch's store. Yea, from these I reap as true And as large contents as you. Yet to them I am not tied: I have rarer sweets espied, Wider prospects of true pleasure, Than your curbed thoughts can measure. In her soul my soul descries Objects that may feed her eyes. And the beauty of her mind Shows my reason where to find All my former pleasure doubled, Neither with such passion troubled, As wherewith it oft was crost, Nor so easy to be lost. I that ravish'd lay, well-nigh, By the lustre of her eye, And had almost sworn affection To the fore-express'd perfection, As if nothing had been higher Whereunto I might aspire, Now have found, by seeking nearer, Inward worth that shining clearer By a sweet and secret moving, Draws me to a dearer loving. And whilst I that love conceive, Such impressions it doth leave In the intellective part, As defaceth from my heart Every thought of those delights Which allure base appetites; And my mind so much employs In contemplating those joys Which a purer sight doth find In the beauty of her mind, That I so thereon am set, As methinks I could forget All her sweetest outward graces, Though I lay in her embraces. But some, thinking with a smile What they would have done the while, Now suppose my words are such As exceed my power too much. For all those our wantons hold Void of vigour, dull, and cold, Or at best but fools, whose flame Makes not way unto their shame, Though at length with grief they see They the fools do prove to be. These the body so much minded, That their reason, over-blinded By the pleasures of the sense, Hides from them that excellence, And that sweetness, whose true worth I am here to blazon forth. 'Tis not, 'tis not those rare graces That do lurk in women's faces, 'Tis not a display'd perfection, Youthful eyes, nor clear complexion, Nor a skin, smooth satin like, Nor a dainty rosy cheek, That to wantonness can move Such as virtuously do love. Beauty rather gently draws Wild desires to reason's laws; And oft frights men from that sin They had else transgressed in, Through a sweet amazement strook From an over-ruling look. Beauty never tempteth men To lasciviousness, but when Careless idleness hath brought Wicked longings into thought. Nor doth youth, or heat of blood, Make men prove what is not good, Nor the strength of which they vaunt; 'Tis the strength and power they want; And the baseness of the mind Makes their brute desires inclin'd To pursue those vain delights Which affect their appetites; And so blinded do they grow, Who are overtaken so, As their dullness cannot see, Nor believe that better be. Some have blood as hot as their, Whose affections loosest are; Bodies that require no art To supply weak Nature's part; Youth they have; and sure might, too, Boast of what some shameless do; Yet their minds, that aim more high Than those baser pleasures lie, Taught by virtue can suppress All attempts of wantonness, And such powerful motives frame To extinguish passion's flame, That, by reason's good direction, Qualifying loose affection, They'll in midst of beauty's fires Walk unscorch'd of ill desires; Yet no such as stupid shame Keeps from actions worthy blame, But in all so truly man, That their apprehensions can Prize the body's utmost worth, And find many pleasures forth In those beautiesâmore than you, That abuse them, ever knew. But perhaps her outward grace, Here described, hath ta'en such place In some o'er-enamour'd breast, And so much his heart possessed, As he thinks it passeth telling, How she may be more excelling, Or what worth I can prefer To be more admired in her. Therefore now I will be brief, To prevent that misbelief. And if there be present here Any one whose nicer ear Tasks my measures as offending, In too seriously commending What affects the sense, or may Injure virtue any way, Let them know 'tis understood That if they were truly good, It could never breed offence That I showed the excellence, With the power of God and nature, In the beauty of his creature: They from thence would rather raise Cause to meditate his praise, And thus think: How fair must He That hath made this fair one be! That was my proposed end, And to make them more attend Unto this, so much excelling, As it passeth means of telling. But, at worst, if any strain Makes your memories retain Sparks of such a baneful fire As may kindle ill desire, This that follows after shall Not alone extinguish all, But e'en make you blush with shame, That your thoughts were so to blame. Yet I know, when I have done, In respect of that bright sun Whose inestimable light I would blazon to your sight, These ensuing flashes are As to Cynthia's beams a star; Or a petty comet's ray, To the glorious eye of day. For what power of words or art Can her worth at full impart? Or what is there may be found, Plac'd within the senses' bound, That can paint those sweets to me, Which the eyes of love do see? Or the beauties of that mind Which her body hath enshrined? Can I think the Guide of Heaven Hath so bountifully given Outward features, cause He meant To have made less excellent Her divine part? Or suppose Beauty goodness doth oppose, Like those fools who do despair To find any good and fair? Rather there I seek a mind Most excelling, where I find God hath to the body lent Most beseeming ornament. But, though he that did inspire First the true Promethean fire, In each several soul did place Equal excellence and grace, As some think, yet have not they Equal beauties every way. For they more or less appear As the outward organs are: Following much the temp'rature Of the body, gross or pure. And I do believe it true, That, as we the body view Nearer to perfection grow, So the soul herself doth show Others more and more excelling In her power, as in her dwelling. For that pureness giveth way, Better to disclose each ray To the dull conceit of man, Than a grosser substance can. Thus, through spotless crystal, we May the day's full glory see; When, if clearest sunbeams pass Through a foul polluted glass, So discolour'd they'll appear, As those stains they shone through were. Let no critic cavil then, If I dare affirm again That her mind's perfections are Fairer than her body's far; And I need not prove it by Axioms of philosophy, Since no proof can better be Than their rare effect in me. For, while other men complaining, Tell their mistresses' disdaining, Free from care I write a story Only of her worth and glory. While most lovers pining sit, Robb'd of liberty and wit, Vassaling themselves with shame To some proud imperious dame, Or in songs their fate bewailing, Show the world their faithless failing, I, enwreath'd with boughs of myrtle, Fare like the beloved turtle. Yea, while most are most untoward, Peevish, vain, inconstant, froward, While their best contentments bring Nought but after-sorrowing, She those childish humours slighting Hath conditions so delighting, And doth so my bliss endeavour, As my joy increaseth ever. By her actions I can see That her passions so agree Unto reason, as they err Seldom to distemper her. Love she can, and doth, but so As she will not overthrow Love's content by any folly, Or by deeds that are unholy. Dotingly she ne'er affects; Neither willingly neglects Honest love; but means doth find With discretion to be kind. 'Tis nor thund'ring phrase, nor oaths, Honours, wealth, nor painted clothes, That can her good liking gain, If no other worth remain. Never took her heart delight In your court-hermaphrodite, Or such frothy gallants as For the time's heroÃ«s pass, Such who, still in love, do all Fair, and sweet, and lady call, And where'er they hap to stray, Either prate the rest away, Or of all discourse to seek Shuffle in at cent or gleek. Goodness more delights her than All their mask of folly can. Fond she hateth to appear, Though she hold her friend as dear As her part of life unspent, Or the best of her content. If the heat of youthful fires Warm her blood with those desires Which are by the course of nature Stirred in every perfect creature, As those passions kindle, so Doth Heaven's grace and reason grow Abler to suppress in her Those rebellions, and they stir Never more affection then One good thought allays again. I could say so chaste is she As the new-blown roses be; Or the drifts of snow that none Ever touch'd or look'd upon. But that were not worth a fly, Seeing so much chastity Old Pygmalion's picture had: Yea, those eunuchs, born or made Ne'er to know desire, might say She deserv'd no more than they; Whereas, whilst their worth proceeds From such wants as they must needs Be unmov'd, 'cause nature framed No affections to be tamed, Through her dainty limbs are spread Vigour, heat, and freely shed Life-blood into every vein, Till they fill and swell again: And no doubt they strive to force Way in some forbidden course, Which by grace she still resists, And so curbs within their lists Those desires, that she is chaster Than if she had none to master. Malice never lets she in, Neither hates she ought but sin. Envy if she could admit, There's no means to nourish it, For her gentle heart is pleased When she knows another's eased: And there's none who ever got That perfection she hath not. So that no cause is there why She should any one envy. Mildly angry she'll appear, That the baser rout may fear Through presumption to misdo: Yet she often feigns that too. But let wrong be whatsoever, She gives way to choler never. If she e'er of vengeance thought 'Twas nor life nor blood was sought, But, at most, some prayer to move Justice for abused love, Or that fate would pay again Love's neglectors with disdain. If she ever crav'd of fate To obtain a higher state, Or ambitiously were given, Sure, 'twas but to climb to heaven. Pride is from her heart as far As the poles in distance are. For her worth, nor all this praise, Can her humble spirit raise Less to prize me than before, Or herself to value more. Were she vain, she might allege 'Twere her sex's privilege. But she's such as doubtless no man Knows less folly in a woman. To prevent a being idle, Sometime, with her curious needle, Though it be her meanest glory, She so limns an antique story, As Minerva, would she take it, Might her richest sample make it. Otherwhile, again, she rather Labours with delight to gather Knowledge from such learned writs As are left by famous wits, Where she chiefly seeks to know God, herself, and what we owe To our neighbour, since with these Come all needful knowledges. She, with Adam, never will Long to learn both good and ill; But her state well understood, Rests herself content with good. Avarice abhorreth she As the loathsom'st things that be; Since she knows it is an ill That doth ripest virtue kill, And, where'er it comes to rest, Though in some strict matron's breast, Be she ne'er so seeming just, I'll no shows of goodness trust. For, if you but gold can bring, Such are hired to any thing. If you think she jealous be, You are wide, for credit me, Her strong'st jealousies nought are Other than an honest care Of her friends; and most can tell Whoso wants that, loves not well. Though some little fear she shows, 'Tis no more than love allows: So the passion do not move her Till she grieve or wrong her lover. She may think he may do ill, Though she'll not believe he will: Nor can such a harmless thought Blemish true affection ought; Rather, whenas else it would Through security grow cold, This her passion, keeping measure, Strengthens love and sweetens pleasure. Cruelty her soul detests, For within her bosom rests Noblest pity, usher'd by An unequall'd courtesy, And is griev'd at good men's moan As the grief were all her own. Just she is; so just, that I Know she would not wrong a fly, Or oppress the meanest thing To be mistress to a king. If our painters would include Temperance and Fortitude In one picture, she would fit For the nonce to pattern it. Patient as the lamb is she, Harmless as the turtles be; Yea, so largely stor'd with all Which we mortals goodness call, That if ever virtue were, Or may be, incarnate here, This is she, whose praises I Offer to eternity. She's no image trimmed about, Fair within and foul without, But a gem that doth appear Like the diamond, everywhere Sparkling rays of beauty forth, All of such unblemish'd worth, That, were 't possible your eye Might her inmost thoughts espy, And behold the dimmest part Of the lustre in her heart, It would find that centre pass What the superficies was. And that every angle there Like a diamond's inside were. For, although that excellence Pass the piercing'st eye of sense, By their operations we Guess at things that hidden be. So, beyond our common reach, Wise men can by reason teach What the influences been Of a planet when unseen, Or the beauty of a star That doth shine above us far. So, by that wide-beaming light Wherewith Titan courts our sight, By his clothing of the earth, By the woundrous, various birth Of new creatures yearly bred Through his heat, and nourished, And by many virtues moe, Which our senses reach unto, We conclude they are not all Which make fair that goodly ball. Though she prize her honour more Than the far-fetched precious store Of the rich Molucchi, or All the wealth was traffick'd for, Since our vessels passage knew Unto Mexico, Peru, Or those spacious kingdoms which Make the proud Iberians rich, 'Tis not that uncertain blast Keeps my mistress good or chaste. She that but for honour's sake Doth of ill a conscience make, More in fear what rumour says, Than in love to virtuous ways; Though she seem'd more civil than You have seen a courtesan For an honour, and cries, oh, fie! At each show of vanity; Though she censure all that be Not so foolish coy as she; Though she with the Roman dame Kill herself to purchase fame; She would prostitute become To the meanest, basest groom, If so closely they may do it As the world should never know it. So at best those women prove That for honour virtue love. Give me her that goodness chooseth For its own sake, and refuseth To have greatest honours gain'd With her secret conscience stain'd. Give me her that would be poor, Die disgrac'd, nay, thought a whore, And each time's reproach become, Till the general day of doom, Rather than consent to act Pleasing sin, though by the fact, With esteem of virtuous, she Might the German Empress be. Such my mistress is, and nought Shall have power to change her thought; Pleasures cannot tempt her eye On their baits to glance awry, For their good she still esteems As it is, not as it seems, And she takes no comfort in Sweetest pleasure sour'd with sin. By herself she hath such care, That her actions decent are. For, were she in secret hid, None might see her what she did, She would do as if for spies Every wall were stuck with eyes, And be chary of her honour 'Cause the heavens do look upon her. And oh, what had power to move Flames of lust, or wanton love, So far to disparage us, If we all were minded thus? These are beauties that shall last When the crimson blood shall waste, And the shining hair wax grey, Or with age be worn away. These yield pleasures such as might Be remembered with delight, When we gasp our latest breath On the loathed bed of death. Though discreetly speak she can, She'll be silent rather than Talk while others may be heard, As if she did hate or fear'd Their condition who will force All to wait on their discourse. Reason hath on her bestow'd More of knowledge than she ow'd To that sex, and grace with it Doth aright her practice fit. Yet hath fate so framed her, As she may at sometime err: But if e'er her judgment stray, 'Tis that other women may Those much pleasing beauties see Which in yielding natures be. For since no perfection can Here on earth be found in man, There's more good in free submissions Than there's ill in our transgressions. Should you hear her once contend, In discoursing, to defend, As she can, a doubtful cause, She such strong positions draws From known truths, and doth apply Reasons with such majesty, As if she did undertake From some oracle to speak: And you could not think what might Breed more love or more delight. Yet, if you should mark again Her discreet behaviour when She finds reason to repent Some wrong-pleaded argument, She so temperately lets all Her mis-held opinions fall, And can with such mildness bow, As 'twill more enamour you Than her knowledge: for there are Pleasing sweets without compare In such yieldings, which do prove Wit, humility, and love. Yea, by those mistakings you Her condition so shall know, And the nature of her mind So undoubtedly shall find, As will make her more endear'd Than if she had never err'd. Farther, that she nought may miss Which worth praise in woman is, This unto the rest I add: If I wound or sickness had, None should for my curing run, No, not to Apollo's son; She so well the virtue knows, Of each needful herb that grows, And so fitly can apply Salves to every malady, That if she no succour gave me, 'Twere no means of art could save me. Should my soul oppressed lie, Sunk with grief and sorrow nigh, She hath balm for minds distrest, And could ease my pained breast. She so well knows how to season Passionate discourse with reason, And knows how to sweeten it, Both with so much love and wit, That it shall prepare the sense To give way with less offence. For griev'd minds can ill abide Counsel churlishly applied, Which, instead of comfortings, Desperation often brings. But hark, nymphs, methinks I hear Music sounding in mine ear. 'Tis a lute, and he's the best For a voice in all the west That doth touch it. And the swain I would have you hear so fain, That my song forbear will I, To attend his melody. Hither comes he day by day, In these groves to sing and play. And in yon close arbour he Sitteth now, expecting me. He so bashful is, that mute Will his tongue be, and his lute, Should he happen to espy This unlook'd-for company. If you, therefore, list to hear him, Let's with silence walk more near him. 'Twill be worth your pains, believe me, If a voice content may give ye, And await you shall not long, For he now begins a song. SONNET 1. What is the cause, when elsewhere I resort, I have my gestures and discourse more free? And, if I please, can any beauty court, Yet stand so dull and so demure by thee? Why are my speeches broken whilst I talk? Why do I fear almost thy hand to touch? Why dare I not embrace thee as we walk, Since with the greatest nymphs I've dared as much? Ah! know that none of those I e'er affected, And therefore used a careless courtship there, Because I neither their disdain respected, Nor reckoned them or their embraces dear. But, loving thee, my love hath found content And rich delights in things indifferent. SONNET 2. Why covet I thy blessed eyes to see, Whose sweet aspect may cheer the saddest mind? Why, when our bodies must divided be, Can I no hour of rest or pleasure find? Why do I sleeping start, and waking moan, To find that of my dreamed hopes I miss? Why do I often contemplate alone Of such a thing as thy perfection is? And wherefore, when we meet, doth passion stop My speechless tongue, and leave me in a panting? Why doth my heart, o'ercharged with fear and hope, In spite of reason, almost droop to fainting? Because in me thy excellences moving Have drawn me to an excellence in loving. SONNET 3. Fair, since thy virtues my affections move, And I have vow'd my purpose is to join In an eternal band of chastest love Our souls, to make a marriage most divine. Why, thou may'st think, then seemeth he to prize An outward beauty's fading hue so much? Why doth he read such lectures in mine eyes? And often strive my tender palm to touch? Oh, pardon my presuming; for I swear My love is soiled with no lustful spot: Thy soul's perfections through those veils appear, And I half faint that I embrace them not. No foul desires doth make thy touches sweet: But my soul striveth with thy soul to meet. SONNET 4. Shall I wasting in despair Die because a woman's fair? Or make pale my cheeks with care 'Cause another's rosy are? Be she fairer than the day, Or the flowery meads in May, If she be not so to me What care I how fair she be? Should my heart be griev'd or pin'd 'Cause I see a woman kind? Or a well-disposed nature Joined with a lovely feature? Be she meeker, kinder than Turtle-dove or pelican, If she be not so [to] me What care I how kind she be? Shall a woman's virtues move Me to perish for her love? Or her well-deserving known, Make me quite forget mine own? Be she with that goodness blest Which may gain her name of best, If she be not such to me What care I how good she be? 'Cause her fortune seems too high, Shall I play the fool and die? Those that bear a noble mind, Where they want of riches find Think what with them they would do That without them dare to woo. And unless that mind I see What care I though great she be? Great, or good, or kind, or fair, I will ne'er the more despair; If she love me, this believe, I will die ere she shall grieve. If she slight me when I woo I can scorn and let her go, For if she be not for me What care I for whom she be? SONNET 5. I wandered out a while agone, And went I know not whither: But there do beauties many a one Resort and meet together. And Cupid's power will there be shown If ever you come thither. For like two suns, two beauties bright I shining saw together, And tempted by their double light My eyes I fix'd on either; Till both at once so thrall'd my sight, I lov'd, and knew not whether. Such equal sweet Venus gave, That I preferr'd not either, And when for love I thought to crave I knew not well of whether. For one while this I wish'd to have, And then I that had liefer. A lover of the curious't eye Might have been pleas'd in either, And so, I must confess, might I, Had they not been together. Now both must love or both deny, In one enjoy I neither. But yet at last I 'scap'd the smart I fear'd at coming hither; For seeing my divided heart, I choosing, knew not whether, Love angry grew, and did depart, And now I care for neither. See, these trees so ill did hide us, That the shepherd hath espied us, And, as jealous of his cunning, All in haste away is running. To entreat him back again Would be labour spent in vain. You may therefore now betake ye To the music I can make ye, Who do purpose my invention, Shall pursue my first intention. For in her whose worth I tell Many excellences dwell Yet unmention'd, whose perfections Worthy are of best affections. That which is so rare to find, Both in man and womankind, That, whose absence love defaceth, And both sexes more disgraceth Than the spite of furrow'd age, Sicknesses, or sorrow's rage, That's the jewel so divine Which doth on her forehead shine, And therewith endow'd is she In an excellent degree: Constancy, I mean, the purest Of all beauties, and the surest; For whoe'er doth that profess, Hath an endless loveliness. All afflictions, labours, crosses, All our dangers, wounds, and losses, Games of pleasure we can make For that matchless woman's sake, In whose breast that virtue bideth; And we joy whate'er betideth. Most dejected hearts it gladdeth, Twenty thousand glories addeth Unto beauty's brightest ray, And preserves it from decay; 'Tis the salt that's made to season Beauty for the use of reason; 'Tis the varnish, and the oiling, Keeps her colours fresh from spoiling; 'Tis an excellence whereby Age, though join'd with poverty, Hath more dear affection won Than fresh youth and wealth have done; 'Tis a loveliness endearing Beauties scarce worth note appearing; Whilst a fairer fickle dame Nothing gains but scorn and shame. Further, 'tis a beauty such As I cannot praise too much, Nor frame measures to express, No, nor any man, unless He who more than all men crost Finds it in that woman lost, On whose faith he would have pawn'd Life, and all he could command. Such a man may by that miss Make us know how dear it is, When, o'ercharg'd with grief, he shall Sigh, and break his heart withal. This is that perfection which In her favour makes me rich. All whose beauties, named before, Else would but torment me more; And in having this, I find, Whate'er haps, a quiet mind. Yea, 'tis that which I do prize Far above her lips, her eyes, Or that general beauty whence Shines each several excellence. For, alas! what gain'd hath he Who may clip the fairest she That the name of woman bears, If, unhappily, he fears Any other's worth may win What he thought his own had bin? Him base-minded deem I should, Who, although he were in hold, Wrapp'd in chains, would not disdain Love with her to entertain That both daughter to a peer, And most rich and lovely were, When a brainless gull shall dare In her favours with him share, Or the action of a player Rob him of a hope so fair. This I dread not: for I know Strained gestures, painted show, Shameless boastings, borrow'd jests, Female looks, gay-plumed crests, Vows nor protestations vain, Wherewith fools are made so vain, Move her can, save to contemn, Or, perhaps, to laugh at them. Neither can I doubt or fear Time shall either change or wear This her virtue, or impair That which makes her soul so fair: In which trust great comforts are, Which the fear of loss would mar. Nor hath this my rare hope stood So much in her being good, With her love to blessed things, As in her acknowledgings From a higher Power to have them, And her love to Him that gave them. For, although to have a mind Naturally to good inclin'd, And to love it, would assure Reason that it might endure, Yet, since man was first unjust, There's no warrant for such trust. Virtues that most wonder win, Would converted be to sin, If their flourishings began From no better root than man. Our best virtues, when they are Of themselves, we may compare To the beauty of a flower That is blasted in an hour, And which, growing to be fuller, Turns into some loathed colour. But those being freely given And confirm'd in us from heaven, Have a promise on them past, And for evermore shall last, Diamond-like, their lustre clearing More and more by use and wearing. But if this rare worth I praise Should by Fate's permission raise Passions in some gentle breast That distemper may his rest, And be author of such treason As might nigh endanger reason, Or enforce his tongue to crave What another man must have, Mark, in such a strait as this, How discreet her dealing is. She is nothing of their humours Who their honour build on rumours, And had rather private sporting Than allow of open courting; Nor of theirs that would seem holy By divulging others' folly: Further is she from their guise, That delight to tyrannize, Or make boastings in espying Others for their favours dying. She a spirit doth possess So replete with nobleness, That, if she be there beloved Where she ought not to be moved Equally to love again, She doth so well entertain That affection, as there's none Can suppose it ill bestown. From deluding she is free; From disdain as far is she; And so feelingly bears part Of what pains another's heart, That no curse of scorned duty Shall draw vengeance on her beauty. Rather, with so tender fear Of her honour and their care She is touch'd, that neither shall Wrong unto herself befall, By the favour she doth show, Nor will she neglect them so As may just occasion give Any way to make them grieve. Hope she will not let them see, Lest they should presuming be, And aspire to that which none Ever must enjoy but one. From despair she keeps them too, Fearing they might hap to do, Either through love's indiscretions Or much over-stirred passions, What might with their hurt and shame Into question call her name, And a scandal on her bring Who is just in everything. She hath mark'd how others run, And by them hath learn'd to shun Both their fault who, overwise, Err by being too precise; And their folly that, o'erkind, Are to all complaints inclin'd. For her wit hath found the way How awhile to hold them play; And that inconvenience shun Whereinto both seem to run, By allowing them a scope Just bewixt despair and hope. Where confin'd, and reaching neither, They do take a part in either, Till, long living in suspense, Tired by her indifference, Time at last their passion wears; Passions wearing, reason clears; Reason gives their judgment light; Judgment bringeth all to right. So their hope appearing vain, They become themselves again, And with high applauses, fit For such virtue with such wit, They that service only proffer She may take and they may offer. Yet this course she never proves, Save with those whose virtuous loves Use the noblest means of gaining Favours worthy the obtaining. And if such should chance to err, Either 'gainst themselves or her, In some oversights, when they Are through passion led astray, She so well man's frailty knows, With the darts that beauty throws, As she will not adding terror Break the heart for one poor error. Rather, if still good they be, Twenty remedies hath she Gently to apply, where sense Hath invaded reason's fence, And, without or wound or scar, Turns to peace a lawless war. But to those whose baser fires Breathe out smoke of such desires As may dim with impure steams Any part of beauty's beams, She will deign no milder way Those foul burnings to allay, Save with such extreme neglect As shall work her wish'd effect. And to use so sharp a cure She's not oft constrained, sure, 'Cause upon her forehead still Goodness sits, so fear'd of ill, That the scorn and high disdains, Wherewithal she entertains Those loathed glances, giveth ending To such flamings in the tinding, That their cooled hopes needs must Freeze desires in heat of lust. 'Tis a power that never lies In the fair'st immodest eyes. Wantons, 'tis not your sweet eyeings, Forced passions, feigned dyings, Gestures, temptings, tears, beguilings, Dancings, singings, kissings, smilings, Nor those painted sweets with which You unwary men bewitch, All united, nor asunder, That can compass such a wonder, Or to win you love prevails Where her moving virtues fails. Beauties, 'tis not at all those features, Placed in the fairest creatures, Though their best they should discover, That can tempt from her a lover. 'Tis not those soft snowy breasts, Where love rock'd in pleasure rests, And, by their continual motions, Draweth hearts to vain devotions; Nor the nectar that we sip From a honey-dropping lip; Nor those eyes whence beauty's lances Wound the heart with wanton glances; Nor those sought delights that lie In love's hidden treasury, That can liking gain where she Will the best beloved be. For should those who think they may Draw my love from her away, Bring forth all their female graces, Wrap me in their close embraces, Practise all the art they may, Weep, or sing, or kiss, or pray, And with sighs and looks come woo me, When they soonest may undo me, One poor thought of her would arm me So as Circe could not harm me. Since beside those excellences Wherewith others please the senses, She whom I have prized so Yields delights for reason too, Who could dote on thing so common As mere outward-handsome woman? Those half-beauties only win Fools to let affection in; Vulgar wits, from reason shaken, Are with such impostures taken; And with all their art in love, Wantons can but wantons move. But when unto those are join'd Those things which adorn the mind, None their excellences see But they straight enthralled be. Fools and wise men, worst and best, Subject are to love's arrest. For, when virtue woos a lover, She's an unresisted mover, That will have no kind of nay, And in love brooks no delay. She can make the sensual wights To restrain their appetites; And, her beauty when they see, Spite of vice, in love to be; Yea, although themselves be bad, Praise the good they never had. She hath to her service brought Those that her have set at nought, And can fair enough appear To enflame the most severe. She hath oft allured out The religiously devout From their cloisters and their vows, To embrace what she allows, And to such contentments come, As blind zeal had barr'd them from, While, her laws misunderstood, They did ill for love of good. Where I find true worth to be Sweetest are their lips to me; And embraces tempt me to More than outward beauties do, That my firm belief is this: If ever I do amiss, Seeming good the bait will lay That to ill shall me betray, Since, where shows of goodness are, I am oft embolden'd there Freedoms to permit and use Which I elsewhere do refuse, For because I think they mean To allow no deed unclean. Yet where two love virtue shall Both at once, they seldom fall. For when one hath thoughts of ill, T'other helps exile them still. My fair virtue's power is this. And that power the beauty is, Which doth make her here exprest Equally both fair and blest. This was that contenting grace Which affection made me place With so dear respect that never Can it fail, but last for ever. This a servant made me sworn, Who beforetime held in scorn To yield vassalage or duty, Though unto the queen of beauty. Yet that I her servant am, It shall more be to my fame Than to own these woods and downs, Or be lord of fifty towns. And my mistress to be deem'd, Shall more honour be esteem'd Than those titles to acquire Which most women most desire. Yea, when you a woman shall Countess or a duchess call, That respect it shall not move, Neither gain her half such love As to say, Lo, this is she That supposed is to be Mistress to Philarete, And that lovely nymph which he In a pastoral poem famed, And Fair Virtue there hath named. Yea, some ladies, ten to one, If not many, now unknown, Will be very well-a-paid When by chance she hears it said She that fair one is whom I Here have praised concealedly. And though now this age's pride May so brave a hope deride, Yet when all their glories pass As the thing that never was, And on monuments appear That they e'er had breathing here Who envy it, she shall thrive In her fame, and honour'd live Whilst Great Britain's shepherds sing English in their sonneting. And whoe'er in future days Shall bestow the utmost praise On his love that any man Attribute to creature can, 'Twill be this, that he hath dared His and mine to have compared. Oh! what stars did shine on me When her eyes I first did see! And how good was their aspect When we first did both affect! For I never since to changing Was inclined, or thought of ranging. Me so oft my fancy drew Here and there, that I ne'er knew Where to place desire before So that range it might no more, But as he that passeth by, Where in all her jollity Flora's riches in a row Doth in seemly order grow, And a thousand flowers stand Bending as to kiss his hand, Out of which delightful store One he may take, and no more, Long he pausing, doubteth whether Of those fair ones he should gather: First the primrose courts his eyes; Then the cowslip he espies; Next the pansy seems to woo him; Then carnations bow unto him, Which whilst that enamour'd swain From the stalk intends to strain, As half fearing to be seen, Prettily her leaves between Peeps the violet, pale to see That her virtues slighted be, Which so much his liking wins, That to seize her he begins; Yet, before he stoop'd so low, He his wanton eye did throw On a stem that grew more high, And the rose did there espy, Who, beside her precious scent, To procure his eyes content, Did display her goodly breast; Where he found at full exprest All the good that nature showers On a thousand other flowers; Wherewith he, affected, takes it, His beloved flower he makes it, And, without desire of more, Walks through all he saw before: So I wandering but erewhile Through the garden of this isle, Saw rich beauties, I confess, And in number numberless; Yea, so differing-lovely too, That I had a world to do Ere I could set up my rest Where to choose, and choose the best. One I saw whose hair excell'd, On another's brow there dwell'd Such a majesty, it seem'd She was best to be esteem'd. This had with her speeches won me, That with silence had undone me. On her lips the Graces hung, T'other charm'd me with her tongue. In her eyes a third did bear That which did anew ensnare. Then a fourth did fairer show, Yet wherein I did not know; Only this perceived I, Somewhat pleas'd my fantasy. Now the wealth I most esteem'd; Honour then I better deem'd. Next, the love of beauty seiz'd me, And then virtue better pleas'd me. Juno's love I nought esteem'd, Whilst a Venus fairer seem'd. Nay, both could not me suffice; Whilst a Pallas was more wise: Though I found enough in one To content if still alone. Amaryllis I did woo; And I courted Phyllis too. Daphne for her love I chose; Chloris for that damask rose In her cheek I held as dear; Yea, a thousand lik'd well near, And, in love with altogether, Feared the enjoying either, 'Cause, to be of one possest, Barred the hope of all the rest. Thus I fondly far'd, till Fateâ Which, I must confess, in that Did a greater favour to me Than the world can malice do meâ Show'd to me that matchless flower, Subject for this song of our. Whose perfection having eyed, Reason instantly espied That desire, which rang'd abroad, There would find a period. And no marvel if it might; For it there hath all delight, And in her hath Nature placed What each several fair one graced. Nor am I alone delighted With those graces all united Which the sense's eye doth find Scattered throughout womankind, But my reason finds perfections To inflame my soul's affections. Yea, such virtues she possesseth, As with firmest pleasures blesseth, And keeps sound that beauty's state Which would else grow ruinate. In this flower are sweets such store I shall never wish for more, Nor be tempted out to stray For the fairest buds in May. Let who list for me advance The admired flowers of France; Let who will praise and behold The reserved marigold; Let the sweet-breath'd violet now Unto whom she pleaseth bow, And the fairest lily spread Where she will her golden head; I have such a flower to wear, That for those I do not care. Never shall my fancy range, Nor once think again of change; Never will I, never more, Grieve or sigh as heretofore, Nor within the lodgings lie Of despair or jealousy. Let the young and happy swains Playing on the Britain plains Court unblam'd their shepherdesses, And with their gold-curled tresses Toy uncensur'd, until I Grutch at their prosperity. Let all times, both present, past, And the age that shall be last, Vaunt the beauties they bring forth; I have found in one such worth That, content, I neither care What the best before me were, Nor desire to live and see Who shall fair hereafter be; For I know the hand of Nature Will not make a fairer creature; Which, because succeeding days Shall confess, and add their praise In approving what my tongue, Ere they had their being, sung; Once again come lend an ear, And a rapture you shall hear, Though I taste no Thespian spring, Will amaze you whilst I sing. I do feel new strains inspiring, And to such brave heights aspiring, That my Muse will touch a key Higher than you heard to-day. I have beauties to unfold That deserve a pen of gold, Sweets that never dream'd of were, Things unknown, and such as ear Never heard a measure sound Since the sun first ran his round. When Apelles limn'd to life Loathed Vulcan's lovely wife, With such beauties he did trim Each sweet feature and each limb, And so curiously did place Every well-becoming grace, That 'twas said, ere he could draw Such a piece, he naked saw Many women in their prime, And the fairest of that time; From all which he parts did take, Which aright disposed make Perfect beauty. So, when you Know what I have yet to show, It will seem to pass so far Those things which expressed are That you will suppose I've been Privileged, where I have seen All the good that's spread in parts Through a thousand women's hearts, With their fair'st conditions, lie Bare without hypocrisy, And that I have took from thence Each dispersed excellence To express her who hath gained More than ever one obtained. And yet soft; I fear in vain I have boasted such a strain. Apprehensions ever are Greater than expression far; And my striving to disclose What I know, hath made me lose My invention's better part, And my hopes exceed my art. Speak I can; yet think I more; Words compar'd with thoughts are poor. And I find, had I begun Such a strain, it would be done When we number all the sands Wash'd o'er perjured Goodwin's lands. For of things I should indite, Which, I know, are infinite. I do yield my thoughts did climb Far above the power of rhyme; And no wonder it is so, Since there is no art can show Red in roses, white in snow, Nor express how they do grow. Yea, since bird, beast, stone, and tree, That inferior creatures be, Beauties have which we confess Lines unable to express, They more hardly can enrol Those that do adorn a soul. But suppose my measures could Reach the height I thought they would, Now relate I would not tho' What did swell within me so. For if I should all descry, You would know as much as I, And those clowns the Muses hate Would of things above them prate, Or with their profaning eyes, Come to view those mysteries Whereof, since they disesteem'd them, Heaven hath unworthy deem'd them. And beside, it seems to me That your ears nigh tired be. I perceive the fire that charmeth And inspireth me scarce warmeth Your chill hearts; nay, sure, were I Melted into poesy, I should not a measure hit, Though Apollo prompted it, Which should able be to leave That in you which I conceive. You are cold; and here I may Waste my vital heat away Ere you will be moved so much As to feel one perfect touch Of those sweets which, yet conceal'd, Swell my breast to be reveal'd. Now my words I therefore cease, That my mounting thoughts in peace May alone those pleasures share Whereof lines unworthy are. And so you an end do see Of my song, though long it be. No sooner had the shepherd Philaret To this description his last period set, But instantly, descending from a wood, Which on a rising ground adjoining stood, A troop of satyrs, to the view of all, Came dancing of a new-devised brawl. The measures they did pace by him were taught them, Who to so rare a gentleness had brought them, That he had learned their rudeness an observing Of such respect unto the well-deserving As they became to no men else a terror, But such as did persist in wilful error, And they the ladies made no whit afeard, Though since that time they some great men have scar'd. Their dance the Whipping of Abuse they named; And though the shepherd, since that, hath been blamed, Yet now 'tis daily seen in every town, And there's no country dance that's better known, Nor that hath gain'd a greater commendation 'Mongst those that love an honest recreation. This scene presented, from a grove was heard A set of viols; and there was prepared A country banquet, which this shepherd made To entertain the ladies in the shade. And 'tis suppos'd his song prolonged was Of purpose, that it might be brought to pass; So well it was perform'd, that each one deem'd The banquet might the city have beseem'd. Yet better was their welcome than their fare, Which they perceiv'd, and the merrier were. One beauty, tho', there sat amongst the rest, That look'd as sad as if her heart opprest With love had been. Whom Philaret beholding Sit so demurely, and her arms enfolding, âLady,â quoth he, âam I, or this poor cheer, The cause that you so melancholy are? For, if the object of your thoughts be higher, It fits nor me to know them, nor inquire. But if from me it cometh that offends, I seek the cause, that I may make amends.â âKind swain,â said she, âit is nor so, nor so. No fault in you, nor in your cheer I know. Nor do I think there is a thought in me That can too worthy of your knowledge be. Nor have I, many a day, more pleasure had Than here I find, though I have seemed sad. âMy heart is sometimes heavy when I smile; And when I grieve I often sing the while. Nor is it sadness that doth me possess, But rather musing with much seriousness Upon that multitude of sighs and tears, With those innumerable doubts and fears Through which you passed ere you could acquire A settled hope of gaining your desire. For you dared love a nymph so great and fair As might have brought a prince unto despair; And sure the excellency of your passions Did then produce as excellent expressions. âIf, therefore, me the suit may well become, And if to you it be not wearisome, In name of all these ladies I entreat That one of those sad strains you would repeat Which you compos'd when greatest discontent Unsought-for help to your invention lent.â âFair nymph,â said Philaret, âI will do so. For, though your shepherd doth no courtship know, He hath humanity, and what's in me To do you service may commanded be.â So, taking down a lute that near him hung, He gave 't his boy, who played, whilst this he sung. The following sonnet appears in the printed text in diamond-shaped stanzas. SONNET I. Ah me! Am I the swain, That late from sorrow free, Did all the cares on earth disdain? And still untouch'd, as at some safer games, Play'd with the burning coals of love and beauty's flames? Was't I could dive and sound each passion's secret depth at will, And from those huge o'erwhelmings rise by help of reason still? And am I now, oh heavens! for trying this in vain So sunk that I shall never rise again? Then let despair set sorrow's string For strains that dolefull'st be, And I will sing, Ah me. But why, O fatal Time! Dost thou constrain that I Should perish in my youth's sweet prime? I but awhile ago, you cruel powers, In spite of fortune, cropp'd contentment's sweetest flowers. And yet, unscorned, serve a gentle nymph, the fairest she That ever was beloved of man, or eyes did ever see. Yea, one whose tender heart would rue for my distress; Yet I, poor I, must perish natheless. And, which much more augments my care, Unmoaned I must die, And no man e'er Know why. Thy leave, My dying song, Yet take, ere grief bereave The breath which I enjoy too long. Tell thou that fair one this: my soul prefers Her love above my life, and that I died hers: And let him be for evermore to her remembrance dear, Who loved the very thought of her whilst he remained here. And now farewell, thou place of my unhappy birth, Where once I breathed the sweetest air on earth. Since me my wonted joys forsake, And all my trust deceive, Of all I take My leave. Farewell, Sweet groves, to you; You hills, that highest dwell; And all you humble vales, adieu. You wanton brooks and solitary rocks, My dear companions all, and you, my tender flocks; Farewell, my pipe, and all those pleasing songs whose moving strains Delighted once the fairest nymphs that dance upon the plains; You discontents, whose deep and over-deadly smart Have, without pity, broke the truest heart, Sighs, tears, and every sad annoy That erst did with me dwell, And all others joy, Farewell. Adieu, Fair Shepherdesses; Let garlands of sad yew Adorn your dainty golden tresses. I that loved you, and often with my quill Made music that delighted fountain, grove, and hill; I whom you loved so, and with a sweet and chaste embrace, Yea, with a thousand rarer favours, would vouchsafe to grace, I now must leave you all alone, of love to plain, And never pipe nor never sing again. I must for evermore be gone; And therefore bid I you, And every one, Adieu. I die! For oh, I feel Death's horrors drawing nigh; And all this frame of nature reel. My hopeless heart, despairing of relief, Sinks underneath the heavy weight of saddest grief, Which hath so ruthless torn, so rack'd, so tortur'd every vein, All comfort comes too late to have it ever cur'd again My swimming head begins to dance death's giddy round; A shuddering chillness doth each sense confound: Benumb'd is my cold-sweating brow; A dimness shuts my eye; And now, oh, now I die. So movingly these lines he did express, And to a tune so full of heaviness, As if, indeed, his purpose had been past To live no longer than the song did last, Which in the nymphs such tender passion bred, That some of them did tears of pity shed. This she perceiving, who first craved the song, âShepherd,â she said, âalthough it be no wrong Nor grief to you those passions to recall, Which heretofore you have been pain'd withal, But comforts rather, since they now are over, And you, it seemeth, an enjoying lover, Yet some young nymphs among us I do see Who so much moved with your passions be, That if my aim I taken have aright, Their thoughts will hardly let them sleep to-night. âI dare not, therefore, beg of you again To sing another of the selfsame strain, For fear it breed within them more unrest Than women's weaknesses can well digest. Yet in your measures such content you have, That one song more I will presume to crave. And if your memory preserves of those Which you of your affections did compose Before you saw this mistress, let us hear What kind of passions then within you were.â To which request he instantly obey'd, And this ensuing song both sung and play'd. SONNET 2. You gentle nymphs that on these meadows play, And oft relate the loves of shepherds young, Come, sit you down; for, if you please to stay, Now may you hear an uncouth passion sung. A lad there is, and I am that poor groom, That['s] fall'n in love, and cannot tell with whom. Oh, do not smile at sorrow as a jest; With others' cares good natures moved be; And I should weep if you had my unrest; Then at my grief how can you merry be? Ah, where is tender pity now become? I am in love, and cannot tell with whom. I that have oft the rarest features view'd, And beauty in her best perfection seen; I that have laugh'd at them that love pursued, And ever free from such affections been, Lo, now at last so cruel is my doom, I am in love, and cannot tell with whom. My heart is full nigh bursting with desire, Yet cannot find from whence these longings flow; My breast doth burn, but she that lights the fire I never saw, nor can I come to know. So great a bliss my fortune keeps me from, That though I dearly love, I know not whom. Ere I had twice four springs renewed seen, The force of beauty I began to prove; And ere I nine years old had fully been, It taught me how to frame a song of love, And little thought I, this day should have come, Before that I to love had found out whom. For on my chin the mossy down you see, And in my veins well-heated blood doth glow; Of summers I have seen twice three times three, And fast my youthful time away doth go, That much I fear I aged shall become, And still complain, I love I know not whom. Oh! why had I a heart bestow'd on me To cherish dear affections so inclin'd? Since I am so unhappy born to be No object for so true a love to find. When I am dead it will be missed of some, Yet, now I live, I love I know not whom. I to a thousand beauteous nymphs am known; A hundred ladies' favours do I wear; I with as many half in love am grown; Yet none of them, I find, can be my dear. Methinks I have a mistress yet to come, Which makes me sing, I love I know not whom. There lives no swain doth stronger passion prove For her whom most he covets to possess, Than doth my heart, that being full of love, Knows not to whom it may the same profess. For he that is despis'd hath sorrow some, But he hath more that loves and knows not whom. Knew I my love as many others do, To some one object might my thoughts be bent, So they divided should not wandering go Until the soul's united force be spent. As his that seeks and never finds a home, Such is my rest, that love and know not whom. Those whom the frowns of jealous friends divide May live to meet and descant on their woe; And he hath gain'd a lady for his bride That durst not woo her maid awhile ago. But oh! what end unto my hopes can come That am in love, and cannot tell with whom? Poor Colin grieves that he was late disdain'd, And Chloris doth for Willy's absence pine; Sad Thirsis weeps, for his sick PhÅbe pain'd; But all their sorrows cannot equal mine. A greater care, alas! on me is come: I am in love, and cannot tell with whom. Narcissus-like did I affect my shade, Some shadow yet I had to dote upon; Or did I love some image of the dead, Whose substance had not breathed long agone, I might despair, and so an end would come; But, oh, I love! and cannot tell you whom. Once in a dream methought my love I view'd, But never waking could her face behold; And doubtless that resemblance was but shew'd That more my tired heart torment it should. For, since that time, more griev'd I am become, And more in love; I cannot tell with whom. When on my bed at night to rest I lie, My watchful eyes with tears bedew my cheek; And then, oh, would it once were day, I cry; Yet when it comes I am as far to seek. For who can tell, though all the earth he roam, Or when, or where, to find he knows not whom? Oh! if she be among the beauteous trains Of all you nymphs that haunt the silver rills; Or if you know her, ladies of the plains, Or you that have your bowers on the hills, Tell, if you can, who will my love become, Or I shall die, and never know for whom. The ladies smiled oft when this they heard, Because the passion strange to them appear'd. And stranger was it, since, by his expression, As well as by his own unfeign'd confession, It seemed true. But, having sung it out, And seeing scarcely manners they it thought To urge him farther, thus to them he spake: âFair ladies, forasmuch as doubt you make To re-command me, of mine own accord Another strain I freely will afford. âIt shall not be of love, nor any song Which to the praise of beauty doth belong, But that hereafter, when you hence are gone, Your shepherd may be sometime thought upon. To show you also what content the field And lovely grove to honest minds may yield. That you my humble fate may not despise When you return unto your braveries, And not suppose that in these homely bowers I hug my fortune 'cause I know not yours. Such lines I'll sing as were composed by me When some proud courtiers, where I hapt to be, Did, like themselves, of their own glories prate, As in contempt of my more happy state. And these they be.â SONNET. Lordly gallants, tell me this, Though my safe content you weigh not, In your greatness what one bliss Have you gain'd that I enjoy not? You have honours, you have wealth, I have peace, and I have health; All the day I merry make, And at night no care I take. Bound to none my fortunes be; This or that man's fall I fear not; Him I love that loveth me; For the rest a pin I care not. You are sad when others chaff, And grow merry as they laugh; I, that hate it, and am free, Laugh and weep as pleaseth me. You may boast of favours shown Where your service is applied, But my pleasures are mine own, And to no man's humours tied. You oft flatter, soothe, and feign; I such baseness do disdain, And to none be slave I would, Though my fetters might be gold. By great titles some believe Highest honours are attained; And yet kings have power to give To their fools what these have gained. Where they favour, there they may All their names of honour lay; But I look not rais'd to be Till mine own wing carry me. Seek to raise your titles higher, They are toys not worth my sorrow: Those that we to-day admire Prove the age's scorn to-morrow. Take your honours; let me find Virtue in a free-born mind; This the greatest kings that be Cannot give nor take from me. Though I vainly do not vaunt Large demesnes to feed my pleasure, I have favours where you want That would buy respect with treasure. You have lands lie here and there, But my wealth is everywhere, And this addeth to my store, Fortune cannot make me poor. Say you purchase with your pelf Some respect where you importune, Those may love me for myself That regard you for your fortune. Rich, or born of high degree, Fools as well as you may be: But that peace in which I live No descent nor wealth can give. If you boast that you may gain The respect of high-born beauties, Know I never wooed in vain, Nor preferred scorned duties. She I love hath all delight, Rosy-red with lily-white, And, whoe'er your mistress be, Flesh and blood as good as she. Note of me was never took For my woman-like perfections, But so like a man I look, It hath gain'd me best affections. For my love as many showers Have been wept as have for yours; And yet none doth me condemn For abuse or scorning them. Though of dainties you have store To delight a choicer palate, Yet your taste is pleas'd no more Than is mine in one poor sallet. You to please your senses feed, But I eat good blood to breed, And am most delighted than When I spend it like a man. Though you lord it over me, You in vain thereof have braved, For those lusts my servants be Whereunto your minds are slaved. To yourselves you wise appear, But alas, deceiv'd you are. You do foolish me esteem And are that which I do seem. When your faults I open lay You are moved and mad with vexing; But you ne'er could do or say Ought to drive me to perplexing. Therefore, my despised power Greater is by far than your; And, whate'er you think of me, In your minds you poorer be. You are pleased more or less, As men well or ill report you; And show discontentedness When the times forbear to court you. That in which my pleasures be No man can divide from me; And my care it adds not to Whatso others say or do. Be not proud because you view You by thousands are attended, For alas, it is not you, But your fortune that's befriended. Where I show of love have got Such a danger fear I not, Since they nought can seek of me, But for love belov'd to be. When your hearts have everything You are pleasantly disposed, But I can both laugh and sing Though my foes have me enclosed. Yea, when dangers me do hem, I delight in scorning them, More than you in your renown, Or a king can in his crown. You do bravely domineer Whilst the sun upon you shineth, Yet if any storm appear Basely then your mind declineth. But or shine, or rain, or blow, I my resolutions know; Living, dying, thrall, or free, At one height my mind shall be. When in thraldom I have lain Me not worth your thought you prized. But your malice was in vain, For your favours I despised. And, howe'er you value me, I with praise shall thought on be, When the world esteems you not, And your names shall be forgot. In these thoughts my riches are, Now, though poor or mean you deem me, I am pleased, and do not care How the times or you esteem me. For those toys that make you gay Are but play-games for a day. And when Nature craves her due I as brave shall be as you. Here Philaret did give his song an ending, To which the nymphs so seriously attending About him sat, as if they had supposed He still had somewhat more to be disclosed: And well they knew not whether did belong Most praise unto the shepherd or his song; For though, they must confess, they often hear Those lays which much more deeply learned are, Yet, when they well considered of the place, With how unlikely in their thought it was To give them hope of hearing such a strain, Or that so young and so obscure a swain Should such a matchless beauty's favour get, And know her worth so well to sing of it, They wondered at it, and some thus surmised That he a greater man was, so disguised, Or else that she whom he so much had praised Some goddess was, that those his measures raised Of purpose to that rare-attained height, In envy's and presuming art's despite. But whilst they musing with themselves bethought Which way out of this shepherd to have wrought, What nymph this fair one was, and where she lived, Lo, at that very instant there arrived Three men that by their habits courtiers seemed; For, though obscure, by some he is esteemed Among the greatest, who do not contemn In his retired walks to visit him; And there they taste those pleasures of the mind Which they can nor in court nor city find. Some news or message these new guests had brought him, And to make haste away, it seems, besought him, For instantly he rose, and that his nurture Might not be taxed by a rude departure, Himself excusing, he those nymphs did pray His noble friends might bring them on their way: Who, as it seems, he said, were therefore come That they might wait upon them to their home. So with their favour he departed thence, And, as they thought, to meet her excellence Of whom he sung. Yet many deem that this But an idea of a mistress is, Because to none he yet had deign'd the telling Her proper name, nor shown her place of dwelling. When he was gone a lady from among Those nymphs took up his lute and sung this song. THE NYMPH'S SONG. Gentle swain, good speed befall thee, And in love still prosper thou, Future times shall happy call thee, Though thou lie neglected now. Virtue's lovers shall commend thee, And perpetual fame attend thee. Happy are these woody mountains In whose shadows thou dost hide, And as happy are those fountains By whose murmurs thou dost bide; For contents are here excelling More than in a prince's dwelling. These thy flocks do clothing bring thee, And thy food out of the fields; Pretty songs the birds do sing thee; Sweet perfumes the meadow yields; And, what more is worth the seeing, Heaven and earth thy prospect being? None comes hither who denies thee Thy contentments for despite, Neither any that envies thee That wherein thou dost delight; But all happy things are meant thee, And whatever may content thee. Thy affection reason measures, And distempers none it feeds; Still so harmless are thy pleasures, That no other's grief it breeds; And if night beget thee sorrow, Seldom stays it till the morrow. Why do foolish men so vainly Seek contentment in their store, Since they may perceive so plainly Thou art rich in being poor? And that they are vexed about it, Whilst thou merry art without it. Why are idle brains devising How high titles may be gain'd, Since, by those poor toys despising, Thou hast higher things obtain'd? For the man who scorns to crave them Greater is than they that have them. If all men could taste that sweetness Thou dost in thy meanness know, Kings would be to seek where greatness And their honours to bestow; For it such content would breed them As they would not think they need them. And if those who so aspiring To the court-preferments be, Knew how worthy the desiring Those things are enjoy'd by thee, Wealth and titles would hereafter Subjects be for scorn and laughter. He that courtly styles affected Should a May-lord's honour have: He that heaps of wealth collected Should be counted as a slave: And the man with few'st things cumbered With the noblest should be numbered. Thou their folly hast discerned That neglect thy mind and thee; And to slight them thou hast learned, Of what title e'er they be, That no more with thee obtaineth Than with them thy meanness gaineth. All their riches, honours, pleasures, Poor unworthy trifles seem, If compared with thy treasures, And do merit no esteem. For they true contents provide thee, And from them can none divide thee. Whether thralled or exiled; Whether poor or rich thou be; Whether praised or reviled, Not a rush it is to thee. This nor that thy rest doth win thee, But the mind which is within thee. Then, oh why so madly dote we On those things that us o'er-load? Why no more their vainness note we, But still make of them a god? For, alas! they still deceive us, And in greatest need they leave us. Therefore have the Fates provided Well, thou happy swain, for thee, That may'st here so far divided From the world's distractions be. Thee distemper let them never, But in peace continue ever. In these lonely groves enjoy thou That contentment here begun, And thy hours so pleas'd employ thou Till the latest glass be run. From a fortune so assured By no temptings be allured. Much good do 't them with their glories, Who in courts of princes dwell. We have read in antique stories How some rose, and how they fell. And 'tis worthy well the heeding; There's like end where's like proceeding, Be thou still in thy affection To thy noble mistress true, Let her never-match'd perfection Be the same unto thy view, And let never other beauty Make thee fail in love or duty. For if thou shalt not estranged From thy course professed be, But remain for aye unchanged, Nothing shall have power on thee. Those that slight thee now shall love thee, And, in spite of spite, approve thee. So those virtues, now neglected, To be more esteem'd will come; Yea, those toys so much affected Many shall be wooed from, And the golden age deplored Shall by some be thought restored. Thus sang the nymph, so rarely well inspired, That all the hearers her brave strains admired. And as I heard by some that there attended, When this her song was finished, all was ended. A Postscript If any carp for that my younger times Brought forth such idle fruit as these slight rhymes, It is no matter, so they do not swear That they so ill-employed never were. Whilst their desires perhaps they looselier spent, I gave my heats of youth this better vent, And oft by writing thus the blood have tamed, Which some with reading wanton lays enflamed. Nor care I, though their censure some have pass'd Because my songs exceed the fiddler's last. For do they think that I will make my measures The longer or the shorter for their pleasures? Or maim or curtolize my free invention Because fools weary are of their attention? No; let them know, who do their length contemn, I make to please myself, and not for them. A Miscellany of Epigrams, Sonnets, Epitaphs, and such other Verses as were found written with the Poem aforegoing. 1. OF THE INVENTION OF THE NINE MUSES. The acts of ages past doth Clio write, The tragedy's Melpomene's delight, Thalia is with comedies contented, Euterpe first the shepherd's pipe invented, Terpsichore doth song and lute apply, Dancing Erato found geometry, Calliope on loving verses dwells, The secrets of the stars Urania tells, Polymnia with choice words the speech doth trim, And great Apollo shares with all of them. Those thrice three feminines we Muses call; But that one masculine is worth them all. 2. OF THE LABOURS OF HERCULES. First he the strong Nemean lion slew; The many-headed Hydra next o'erthrew. The Erymanthian boar he thirdly foils; Then of his golden horns the stag he spoils. The foul Stymphalian birds he fifthly frayed; Next he the queen of Amazons o'er-swayed. Then cleansed Augeas' stalls, with filth so full; And eighthly tamed the untamed bull. He slew proud Diomedes with his horses; From triple Geryon his rich herd he forces. He slew the dragon for the fruit of gold, And made black Cerberus the day behold. These were his twelve stout labours. And they say With fifty virgins in one night he lay. If true it be, 'tis thought he labour'd more In that one act than in the twelve before. 3. BEING LEFT BY A GENTLEMAN IN HIS DINING-ROOM, WHERE WAS NOTHING BUT A MAP OF ENGLAND TO ENTERTAIN HIM, HE THUS TURNED IT INTO VERSE. Fair England in the bosom of the seas, Amid her two-and-fifty provinces, Sits like a glorious empress, whose rich throne Great nymphs of honour come to wait upon. First in the height of bravery appears Kent, East-, and South-, and Middle-Saxon shires; Next, Surrey, Berkshire, and Southampton get, With Dorset, Wilton, and rich Somerset. Then Devon, with the Cornish promontory; Gloucester and Worcester, fair Sabrina's glory. Then Salop, Suffolk, Norfolk large and fair, Oxford and Cambridge, that thrice-learned pair. Then Lincoln, Derby, Yorkshire, Nottingham, Northampton, Warwick, Stafford, Buckingham. Chester and Lancaster, with herds well stor'd, Huntingdon, Hertford, Rutland, Hereford. Then princely Durham, Bedford, Leicester, and Northumber-, Cumber-, and cold Westmoreland. Brave English shires, with whom lov'd equally Welsh Monmouth, Radnor, and Montgomery, Add all the glory to her train they can; So doth Glamorgan, Brecknock, Cardigan, Carnarvon, Denbigh, Merionethshire, With Anglesea, which o'er the sea doth rear Her lofty head. And with the first, though last, Flint, Pembroke, and Carmarthen might be plac'd. For all of these unto their power maintain Their mistress England with a royal train. Yea, for supporters at each hand hath she The Wight and Man, that two brave islands be. From these I to the Scottish nymphs had journey'd But that my friend was back again returned, Who having kindly brought me to his home, Alone did leave me in his dining-room, Where I was fain, and glad I had the hap, To beg an entertainment of his map. 4. AN EPITAPH UPON THE RIGHT VIRTUOUS LADY, THE LADY SCOTT. Let none suppose this relic of the just Was here wrapt up to perish in the dust; No, like best fruits her time she fully stood, Then being grown in faith, and ripe in good, With steadfast hope that she another day Should rise with Christ, with Death here down she lay. And that each part which her in life had grac'd Preserv'd might be, and meet again at last, The poor, the world, the heavens, and the grave, Her alms, her praise, her soul, her body have. 5. AN EPITAPH UPON A WOMAN AND HER CHILD, BURIED TOGETHER IN THE SAME GRAVE. Beneath this marble stone doth lie The subject of Death's tyrannyâ A mother, who in this close tomb Sleeps with the issue of her womb. Though cruelly inclin'd was he, And with the fruit shook down the tree, Yet was his cruelty in vain, For tree and fruit shall spring again. 6. A CHRISTMAS CAROL. So now is come our joyful'st feast; Let every man be jolly. Each room with ivy-leaves is dress'd, And every post with holly. Though some churls at our mirth repine, Round your foreheads garlands twine, Drown sorrow in a cup of wine, And let us all be merry. Now all our neighbours' chimneys smoke, And Christmas blocks are burning; Their ovens they with baked meats choke, And all their spits are turning. Without the door let sorrow lie, And if for cold it hap to die, We'll bury 't in a Christmas pie, And evermore be merry. Now every lad is wondrous trim, And no man minds his labour; Our lasses have provided them A bag-pipe and a tabor. Young men, and maids, and girls and boys, Give life to one another's joys, And you anon shall by their noise Perceive that they are merry. Rank misers now do sparing shun, Their hall of music soundeth, And dogs thence with whole shoulders run, So all things there aboundeth. The country-folk themselves advance, For crowdy-mutton's come out of France; And Jack shall pipe, and Jill shall dance, And all the town be merry. Ned Swash hath fetch'd his bands from pawn, And all his best apparel; Brisk Nell hath bought a ruff of lawn With droppings of the barrel; And those that hardly all the year Had bread to eat or rags to wear, Will have both clothes and dainty fare, And all the day be merry. Now poor men to the justices With capons make their arrants, And if they hap to fail of these They plague them with their warrants. But now they feed them with good cheer, And what they want they take in beer, For Christmas comes but once a year, And then they shall be merry. Good farmers in the country nurse The poor, that else were undone. Some landlords spend their money worse, On lust and pride at London. There the roysters they do play, Drab and dice their land away, Which may be ours another day; And therefore let's be merry. The client now his suit forbears, The prisoner's heart is eased, The debtor drinks away his cares, And for the time is pleased. Though others' purses be more fat, Why should we pine or grieve at that? Hang sorrow, care will kill a cat, And therefore let's be merry. Hark how the wags abroad do call Each other forth to rambling; Anon you'll see them in the hall For nuts and apples scambling. Hark how the roofs with laughters sound! Anon they'll think the house goes round, For they the cellar's depth have found, And there they will be merry. The wenches with their wassail-bowls About the streets are singing, The boys are come to catch the owls, The wild mare in is bringing. Our kitchen-boy hath broke his box, And to the dealing of the ox Our honest neighbours come by flocks, And here they will be merry. Now kings and queens poor sheepcotes have, And mate with everybody; The honest now may play the knave, And wise men play at noddy. Some youths will now a-mumming go, Some others play at rowland-hoe, And twenty other gameboys moe, Because they will be merry. Then wherefore in these merry days Should we, I pray, be duller? No; let us sing some roundelays To make our mirth the fuller. And, whilest thus inspir'd we sing, Let all the streets with echoes ring; Woods, and hills, and everything, Bear witness we are merry. 7. AN EPITAPH UPON THE PORTER OF A PRISON. Here lie the bones of him that was of late A churlish porter of a prison gate. Death many an evening at his lodging knock'd, But could not take him, for the door was lock'd; Yet at a tavern late one night he found him, And getting him into the cellar, drown'd him. On which the world, that still the worst is thinking, Reports abroad that he was kill'd with drinking; Yet let no prisoner, whether thief or debtor, Rejoice, as if his fortune were the better; Their sorrow's likely to be ne'er the shorter, The warden lives, though death hath took the porter. 8. A SONNET UPON A STOLEN KISS. Now gentle sleep hath closed up those eyes Which waking kept my boldest thoughts in awe, And free access unto that sweet lip lies, From whence I long the rosy breath to draw; Methinks no wrong it were if I should steal From those two melting rubies one poor kiss; None sees the theft that would the thief reveal, Nor rob I her of ought which she can miss; Nay, should I twenty kisses take away, There would be little sign I had done so; Why then should I this robbery delay? Oh! she may wake, and therewith angry grow. Well, if she do, I'll back restore that one, And twenty hundred thousand more for loan. 9. AN EPITAPH UPON ABRAM GOODFELLOW, A COMMON ALEHOUSE-HUNTER. Beware thou look not who hereunder lies, Unless thou long to weep away thine eyes. This man, as sorrowful report doth tell us, Was, when he lived, the prince of all Goodfellows. That day he died, it cannot be believed How out of reason all the alewives grieved, And what abominable lamentation They made at Black-boy and at Salutation; They howl'd and cried, and ever more among This was the burden of their woeful song: Well, go thy ways, thy like hath never been, Nor shall thy match again be ever seen; For out of doubt now thou art dead and gone, There's many a tap-house will be quite undone, And Death by taking thee did them more scathe, Than yet the alehouse project done them hath. Lo, such a one but yesterday was he, But now he much is alter'd, you do see. Since he came hither he hath left his riot, Yea, changed both his company and diet, And now so civil lies, that to your thinking He neither for an alehouse cares, nor drinking. 10. AN EPITAPH UPON A GENTLEWOMAN WHO HAD FORETOLD THE TIME OF HER DEATH. Her who beneath this stone consuming lies For many virtues we might memorize. But, most of all, the praise deserveth she In making of her words and deeds agree. For she so truly kept the word she spake, As that with Death she promise would not break. âI shall,â quoth she, âbe dead before the mid Of such a month.â And, as she said, she did. 11. AN EPITAPH ON A CHILD, SON TO SIR W. H. KNIGHT. Here lies, within a cabinet of stone, The dear remainder of a pretty one, Who did in wit his years so far outpass, His parents' wonder and their joy he was. And by his face you might have deemed him To be on earth some heavenly Cherubim. Six years with life he labour'd, then deceased, To keep the sabbath of eternal rest; So that which many thousand able men Are lab'ring for till threescore years and ten This blessed child attained to ere seven, And now enjoys it with the saints of Heaven. 12. A SONG. Now, young man, thy days and thy glories appear Like sunshine and blossoms in spring of the year; Thy vigour of body, thy spirits, thy wit, Are perfect and sound and untroubled yet. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Mis-spend not a morning so excellent clear; Never for ever was happiness here. Thy noontide of life hath but little delight, And sorrows on sorrows will follow at night. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. That strength and those beauties that grace thee today To-morrow may perish and vanish away. Thy wealth or thy pleasures, or friends that now be, May waste or deceive, or be traitors to thee. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Thy joints are yet nimble, thy sinews unslack, And marrow unwasted doth strengthen thy back. Thy youth from diseases preserveth the brain, And blood with free passage plumps every vein. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. But trust me it will not for ever be so; Those arms that are mighty shall feebler grow. And those legs so proudly supporting thee now, With age or diseases will stagger and bow. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Then all those rare features now graceful in thee Shall, ploughed with Time's furrows, quite ruined be. And they who admired and loved thee so much, Shall loathe, or forget thou hadst ever been such. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Those tresses of hair which thy youth do adorn Will look like the meads in a winterly morn. And where red and white intermixed did grow, Dull paleness a deadly complexion will show. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. That forehead imperious, whereon we now view A smoothness and whiteness enamelled with blue, Will lose that perfection which youth now maintains, And change it for hollowness, wrinkles, and stains. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Those ears thou with music didst oft entertain, And charm with so many a delicate strain, May miss of those pleasures wherewith they are fed, And never hear song more when youth is once fled. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Those eyes which so many so much did admire, And with strange affections set thousands on fire, Shut up in that darkness which age will constrain, Shall never see mortal, no, never again. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind then, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Those lips whereon beauty so fully discloses The colour and sweetness of rubies and roses, Instead of that hue will ghastliness wear, And none shall believe what perfection was there. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Thy teeth that stood firmly, like pearls in a row, Shall rotten, and scatter'd disorderly grow; The mouth whose proportion earth's wonder was thought, Shall, robb'd of that sweetness, be prized at nought. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. That gait and those gestures that win thee such grace Will turn to a feeble and staggering pace. And thou that o'er mountains ran'st nimbly to-day, Shall stumble at every rub in the way. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. By these imperfections old age will prevail, Thy marrow, thy sinews, and spirits will fail. And nothing is left thee, when those are once spent, To give or thyself or another content. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Those fancies that lull thee with dreams of delight Will trouble thy quiet the comfortless night. And thou that now sleepest thy troubles away, Shalt hear how each cock'rel gives warning of day. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. Then thou that art yet unto thousands so dear, Of all shalt despis'd or neglected appear; Which, when thou perceiv'st, though now pleasant it be, Thy life will be grievous and loathsome to thee. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. That lust which thy youth can so hardly forego Will leave thee, and leave thee repentance and woe. And then in thy folly no joy thou canst have, Nor hope other rest than a comfortless grave. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. For next shall thy breath be quite taken away, Thy flesh turn'd to dust, and that dust turn'd to clay; And those thou hast loved, and share of thy store, Shall leave thee, forget thee, and mind thee no more. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. And yet if in time thou remember not this, The slenderest part of thy sorrow it is: Thy soul to a torture more fearful shall wend, Hath ever and ever, and never an end. Now then, oh, now then, if safety thou love, Mind thou, oh, mind thou thy Maker above. 13. A DREAM. When bright PhÅbus at his rest Was reposed in the west, And the cheerful daylight gone, Drew unwelcome darkness on, Night her blackness wrapp'd about me, And within 'twas as without me. Therefore on my tumbled bed Down I laid my troubled head, Where mine eyes, inured to care, Seldom used to slumb'ring were. Yet, o'ertired of late with weeping, Then by chance they fell a-sleeping. But such visions me diseased, As in vain that sleep I seized: For I sleeping fancies had, Which yet waking make me sad. Some can sleep away their sorrow, But mine doubles every morrow. Walking to a pleasant grove, Where I used to think of love, I methought a place did view Wherein Flora's riches grew. Primrose, hyacinth, and lilies, Cowslips, violets, daffodillies. There a fountain close beside I a matchless beauty spied. So she lay as if she slept, But much grief her waking kept. And she had no softer pillow Than the hard root of a willow. Down her cheeks the tears did flow, Which a grieved heart did show, Her fair eyes the earth beholding, And her arms themselves enfolding; She her passion to betoken, Sigh'd as if her heart were broken. So much grief methought she shew'd, That my sorrow it renew'd; But when nearer her I went It increased my discontent; For a gentle nymph she proved Who me long unknown had loved. Straight on me she fix'd her look, Which a deep impression took; And, âOf all that live,â quoth she, âThou art welcomest to me.â Then, misdoubting to be blamed, Thus she spake, as half ashamed. âThee unknown I long affected, And as long in vain expected; For I had a hopeful thought Thou wouldst crave what others sought; And I for thy sake have stay'd Many wanton springs a maid. âStill, when any wooed me, They renew'd the thought of thee; And in hope thou would'st have tried Their affections, I denied. But a lover forc'd upon me By my friends hath now undone me. âWhat I waking dared not show, In a dream thou now dost know: But to better my estate Now, alas, it is too late. And I, both awake and sleeping, Now consume my youth in weeping.â Somewhat then I would have said, But replyings were denied. For, methought, when speak I would, Not a word bring forth I could. And as I a kiss was taking, That I lost too, by awaking. 14. CERTAIN VERSES WRITTEN TO HIS LOVING FRIEND, UPON HIS DEPARTURE. Swift Time, that will by no entreaty stay, Is now gone by, and summons me away; And what my grief denies my tongue to do, My true affection drives my pen unto. Dear heart, that day and that sad hour is come In which thy face I must be banished from, And go to live where peradventure we Hereafter must for aye divided be. For, 'twixt our bodies, which now close are met, A thousand hills and valleys shall be set, A thousand groves, a thousand weeping springs, And many thousand other envious things, Which, when we are departed, keep us may From coming nearer till our dying day. So these our hands, which thus each other touch Shall never after this time do so much; Nor shall these eyes, which yet themselves delight, With mutual gazing on each other light, Be ever raised up again so near To view each other in their proper sphere; Nor e'er again, through those their crystal orbs, Read what sad passion our poor hearts disturbs. Which when we think upon, we scarce contain Their swelling flood-gates, but a pearly rain Drops from those plenteous springs; and forth are sent From those sad dungeons where our hearts are pent, So many sighs that, in our parting now, A storm of passions we must venture through, Whose fury I would stay to see o'erpast Before I went, in spite of all my haste, But that I view some tokens which foretell That by delay the floods will higher swell, And, whilst to be divided we are loth, With some worse peril overwhelm us both. Oh! rather let us wisely undergo A sorrow that will daily lesser grow, Than venture on a pleasing mischief which Will unawares our honest hearts bewitch, And bring us to such pass at last that we Shall ne'er perceive it till undone we be. I find your love, and so the same approve, That I shall ever love you for that love, And am so covetous of such dear pelf, That for it I could give away myself. And yet I rather would go pine and die For want thereof, than live till you or I Should give or take one dram of that delight Which is another's, and so mar outright Our most unstain'd affection, which hath yet No inclination unto ill in it. Nay, though it more unsufferable were, I would e'en that just liberty forbear Which honest friendship is allow'd to take, If I perceived it me unapt did make To master my affections, or to go On those affairs that reason calls me to. Those parents that discreet in loving be, When on their new-born child a wen they see Which may perchance in aftertime disgrace The sweet proportion of a lovely face, Although it wound their souls to hear the moan, And see the tortures of their pretty one, To weep a little rather are content Whilst he endures the surgeon's instrument, Than suffer that foul blemish there to spread, Until his face be quite disfigured. So we, betwixt whose souls there is begot That sweet babe, friendship, must beware no spot Through our indulgent indiscretion grow, That may the beauty of our love o'erthrow; Let's rather bear a little discontent, And learn of reason those things to prevent Which mar affection, that our friendship may Wax firmer and more lovely every day. There is indeed to gentle hearts no smarting That is more torment to them than departing From those they love; and doubtless if that we Were so united as the married be, Our bodies at our parture would be so As if each of them did a soul forego. But in our flesh we are, and must remain, Perpetual strangers, and ourselves contain From that embrace which marriage love allows, Or else, I injure virtue, you your vows, And for a short unworthy pleasure mar Those rich contentments which eternal are, Of which I am in hope that always we Should in each other's presence guiltless be. But in our absence sure I am we shall Not only still be innocent of all That simple folly and that oversight To which our many frailties tempt us might, But by this means shall also 'scape the blot Wherewith ill tongues our names would seek to spot. Which if you fear, and would avoid the wrongs That may befall you by malicious tongues, Then seek my absence, for I have in that Unto my friends been too unfortunate; Yet as I love fair virtue, there is no man E'er heard me boast the favours of a woman To her dishonour, neither, by my soul, Was I e'er guilty of an act so foul As some imagine; neither do I know That woman yet with whom I might be so; For never kindnesses to me were show'd Which I dared think for evil end bestow'd: Nor ever, to this present hour, did I Turn friendship, favour, opportunity, Or ought vouchsaf'd me, thereby to acquire Those wicked ends which wantons do desire: For whensoever lust begun to flame, It was extinguish'd by true love and shame. But what would this my innocence prevail When your fair name detraction should assail? And how abhorr'd should I hereafter be If you should suffer infamy by me? You fear it not one half so much, you say, As you are loth I should depart away, And hap what will, you think to be content Whilst I am here, and you still innocent. Indeed, those friends approve I not which may By every slanderous tongue be talk'd away; But yet I like not him that will not strive, As much as in him lieth, free to live From giving just occasions of offence, For else he vainly brags of innocence; And so do we, unless that without blame We purpose with our love to keep our fame. Then let us pleased part; and though the dearness Of our affection covets both a nearness In mind and body, let us willingly Beget a virtue of necessity. And since we must compelled be to live By time and place divided, let us strive In the despite of time and distance, so That love of virtue may more perfect grow, And that this separation we lament May make our meeting fuller of content. Betwixt our bodies, this I'll not deny, There is a dear respective sympathy, Which makes us mutually both joy and grieve As there is cause: and farther, I believe That our contentment is imperfect till They have each other in possession still: But that which in us two I love dare name, Is 'twixt our souls, and such a powerful flame, As nothing shall extinguish nor obscure Whilst their eternal substance doth endure; No, not our absence, nor that mighty space Betwixt my home and your abiding-place. For ere your eyes my eyes had ever seen, When many thousand furlongs lay between Our unknown bodies, and before that you Had seen my face, or thought the same to view, You most entirely loved me, you say; Which shows our souls had then found out the way To know each other, and unseen of us, To make our bodies meet unthought of thus. Then much less now shall hill, or dale, or grove, Or that great tract of ground which must remove My body from you, there my soul confine, To keep it back from yours, or yours from mine. Nay, being more acquainted than they were, And active spirits, that can anywhere Within a moment meet, they to and fro Will every minute to each other go, And we shall love with that dear love wherein Will neither be offence nor cause of sin. Yea, whereas carnal love is ever colder As youth decays, and as the flesh grows older, And, when the body is dissolved, must Be buried with oblivion in the dust, We then shall dearer grow, and this our love, Which now imperfect is, shall perfect prove, For there's no mortal power can rob true friends Of that which noblest amity attends, Nor any separation that is able To make the virtuous lovers miserable. Since, when disasters threaten most dejection, Their goodness maketh strongest their affection, And that which works in others' loves denial In them more noble makes it by the trial. 'Tis true that when we part we know not whether These bodies shall for ever meet together, As you have said. Yet, wherefore should we grieve, Since we a better meeting do believe? If we did also know that when we die This love should perish everlastingly, And that we must, as brutish creatures do, Lose with our bodies all our dearness too, Our separation then a sorrow were Which mortal heart had never power to bear, And we should faint and die to think upon The passions would be felt when I were gone. But seeing in the soul our love is plac'd, And seeing souls of death shall never taste, No death can end our loveânay, when we die, Our souls, that now in chains and fetters lie, Shall meet more freely to partake that joy, Compar'd to which our friendship's but a toy, And for each bitterness in this our love We shall a thousand sweet contentments prove. Meanwhile, we that together living may Through human weaknesses be led astray, And unawares make that affection foul Which virtue yet keeps blameless in the soul, By absence shall preserved be as clean As to be kept in our best thoughts we mean, And in our prayers for each other shall Give and receive more kindnesses than all The world can yield us; and when other men Whose love is carnal are tormented when Death calls them hence, because they robbed be Of all their hope for evermore to see The object of their love, we shall avoid That bitter anguish wherewith they are cloy'd. And whensoe'er it happens thou or I Shall feel the time approaching us to die, It shall not grieve us at our latest breath To mind each other on the bed of death, Because of any oversight or sin Whereof we guilty in our souls have bin; Nor will death fear us, 'cause we shall perceive That these contentments which we had not leave To take now we are living, shall be gain'd When our imprison'd souls shall be unchain'd: Nay, rather wish to die, we might possess The sweet fruition of that happiness Which we shall then receive in the perfection Of Him that is the fullness of affection. If time prevented not, I had in store To comfort thee so many reasons more, That thou wouldst leave to grieve, although we should Each other's persons never more behold. But there is hope. And then, that know you may True friends can in their absence find the way To compass their contentments whom they love, You shall ere long the power it hath approve. Meanwhile, you still are dear; yea, live or die, My soul shall love you everlastingly. And howsoe'er there seem such cause of sorrow, Yet those that part and think to meet to-morrow Death may divide to-night, and as before Their fear was less, their grief will be the more. Since, therefore, whether far I live or nigh There is in meeting an uncertainty, Let us for that which surest is provide, Part like those friends whom nothing can divide; And since we lovers first became, that we Might to our power each other's comfort be, Let's not the sweetness of our love destroy, But turn these weepings into tears of joy. On which condition I do give thee this, To be both mine and sorrow's parting kiss. Philarete. FINIS</field>
