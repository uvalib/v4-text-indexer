      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I ESTHER A SONNET SEQUENCE ESTHER, A YOUNG MAN'S TRAGEDY I When is life other than a tragedy, Whether it is played in tears from the first scene, In sable robes and grief's mute pageantry, For loves that died ere they had ever been, Or whether on the edge of joys set keen, While all the stage with laughter is agog, Death stepping forward with an altered mien Pulls off his mask, and speaks the epilogue? Life is a play acted by dying men, Where, if its heroes seem to foot it well And go light-tongued without grimace of pain, Death will be found anon. And who shall tell Which part was saddest, or in youth or age, When the tired actor stops and leaves the stage? II Yes, who shall tell the value of our tears, Whether we wept aright or idly grieved? There is a tragedy in unloved years, And in those passionate hours by love deceived, In lips unkissed and hopes too soon bereaved, And youth's high courage which no strength could save, And manhood's web of fate by folly weaved, And grey-haired grief brought down into the grave. Who shall distinguish truly and be wise 'Twixt grief and grief, 'twixt night and night? The sun Has its own sorrow and a voice that cries Louder than darkness of its joys undone, And pleads with that exceeding bitter cry, “I have tasted honey, and behold, I die!” III A little honey! Ay, a little sweet, A little pleasure when the years were young, A joyous measure trod by dancing feet, A tale of folly told by a loved tongue. These are the things by which our hearts are wrung More than by tears. Oh, I would rather laugh, So I had not to choose such tales among Which was most laughable. Man's nobler half Resents mere sorrow. I would rather sit With just the common crowd that watch the play And mock at harlequin and the clown's wit, And call it tragedy and go my way. I should not err, because the tragic part Lay not in these, but sealed in my own heart. IV And thus it is. The tale I have to tell Is such another. He who reads shall find That which he brings to it of Heaven or Hell For his best recompense where much is blind, A jest-book or a sermon or mere wind,— Each as he may,—for life's least godly mirth Is mingled strangely here with fate unkind, And this is a true story of the Earth. The passionate heart of youth with its desires Is not all noble, and some baseness clings For ever mixed with its eternal fires, Else were it single among human things. And all life's wisdom learns but this last plan, To jest at tears and weep Man's mirth and Man. V I had been an hour at Lyons. My breath comes Fast when I think of it. An hour, no more, I trod those streets and listened to the drums, The mirth, the music, and the city's roar, And found no sermon for me in her stones. It was the evening of St. Martin's fair, And all the world, its working bees and drones, Had gone out to the quays in the sweet air, To taste that thing more sweet to human breath, Its own mad laughter at its own mad kind. “An hour of prayer,” I mused, “for men of faith.” Yet all these worshippers were only blind. And I, no whit less blind, among them went In search of pleasure for my punishment. VI The Lyons fair! In truth it was a Heaven For idlers' eyes, a feast of curious things, Swings, roundabouts, and shows, the Champions Seven, Dramas of battles and the deaths of kings, The whole Place d'Armes grown white as if with snow, With canvas booths arrayed in triple lines, And jugglers, lions, snakes from Mexico, Dancers on tight ropes, clowns and columbines. I went among them all with grave intent, I, too, to find it may be some delight. I was a boy and knew not what life meant, Nor what the pleasures were men seek in it. Only I knew that mingling with that throng, I was a stranger a strange world among. VII I had made my round, as yet with little gain Of undiscovered good in that gay place. I had sought my share of pleasure, but in vain. Laughter was not for me, and hid her face. I had asked for mirth. The oracles were dumb. No sound of Folly with her tinkling feet Had bid my own feet follow, and no home Was mine for merriment or musings sweet. I had ceased to hope and almost ceased to seek, When, from the farthest booth of all, the bray Of brass and drums and fiddling and the shriek Of a dwarf's voice invited me to stay. The crowd, as scenting some more mirthful thing, Surged round that booth agape and wondering. VIII It was a booth no larger than the rest, No loftier fashioned and no more sublime, As poor a shrine as ever youth possessed In which to worship truth revealed in time. Yet to my soul the mean remembrance clings With all the folly of that far fair eve, And my pulse throbs with lost imaginings, And passion rises from its grave to grieve. Vain dreams, brute images! and over all The shrill-voiced dwarf its hierarch and priest, Vaunting its praise, a pagan prince of Baal. It scared me as of some wild idol feast. “The Booth of Beauty,” thus it was I read, Blazoned in scarlet letters overhead. IX I stopped, I listened, and I entered in, With half-a-dozen more, that sight to see. “The Booth of Beauty,” 'twas a name of sin Which seemed to promise a new mystery. There was a crowd already in the place, And 'twixt me and the stage, now darkly hid, The gathering evening had come down apace, And all was dim within and overspread. I know not by what instinct or mute proof Of Providence it was, but this is true, Even as I stepped 'neath that ignoble roof, A prescience warned me there of portents new, And a voice spoke with no uncertain sound Warning me back as from ungodly ground. X An instant, just an instant, and no more, And it was gone, and I with eyes unsealed Saw the bald pageant stripped to its thought's core, And naked there to my scared eyes revealed. Upon a throne which filled the upper space Two female monsters sat, the first a girl Marked like a leopard with pied arms and face, And restless eyes aflame and teeth of pearl. Her as we ventured near, I heard awhile Say she was hungry, and a gleam like blood Lighted her lips and died in a fierce smile. A woman's hand behind me in the crowd Clutched at my arm, and through the booth there went A shiver of half fear, half merriment. XI Beyond her sat a second monster. She In shape and sense was undisguisedly real, An ox-eyed queen of full-fed majesty And giant height and comeliness ideal. She too her tale related, as was due, In measured tones, her age, her birth, her name, Bourgeois her parents, friends of order too, And good Imperialists of honest fame, Her age eighteen, her height seven feet, her waist An ell and more in its circumference, Her leg above the knee, and where was placed Its point of full development. . . The sense Of the rest I lost, for laughing half aloud Again a woman touched me in the crowd. XII She was a little woman dressed in black, Who stood on tiptoe with a childish air, Her face and figure hidden in a sacque, All but her eyes and forehead and dark hair. Her brow was pale, but it was lit with light, And mirth flashed out of it, it seemed in rays. A childish face, but wise with woman's wit, And something, too, pathetic in its gaze. In the bare dusk of that unseemly place I noted all, and this besides, a scar Which on her cheek had left a paler trace. It seemed to tell its tale of love and war. That little scar! Doubt whispered of this one, Boy as I was, she had not lived a nun. XIII A second warning, nor unheeded. Yet The thought appealed to me as no strange thing, Pure though I was, that love impure had set Its seal on that fair woman in her Spring. Her broken beauty did not mar her grace In form or spirit. Nay, it rather moved. It seemed a natural thing for that gay face It should have known and suffered and been loved. It kindled in me, too, to view it thus, A mood of daring which was more than mine, And made my shamefaced heart leap valorous, And fired its courage to a zeal divine. All this, in one short instant, as I gazed Into her eyes, admiring, yet amazed. XIV Me, too, she doubtless read. For, with her hand Raised as for help and pointing to a chair, She bade me, with a gesture, part command And part entreaty, I would set her there. She could not see, she said, the Queen of Love My eyes so coveted, and laughed and laid Upon my lips the fingers of her glove When I protested at the words she said. I hardly know how it all came about But did her bidding as she would, and she From her new vantage bore the humour out And mocked the more at each new mockery. And still she held my arm and I her dress, “Lest she should fall,” she said, in waywardness. XV Thus it began with laughter. But anon The ox-eyed queen, who had resumed by rote The tale of her perfections one by one, Turned by some ominous chance towards the spot Where we two stood. “And take good note,” said she, “All here is honest beauty, flesh and blood, As any in the world. Yet, if there be A doubt between you, let me make it good. Which of you two will honour me so near As to prove the truth?” My cheeks in spite of me Flamed in the dark, and I was seized with fear And a wild doubt lest mine the choice should be. The little woman on the chair began To shout aloud and bid me play the man. XVI Oh, 'tis a terrible thing in early youth To be assailed by laughter and mute shame, A terrible thing to be befooled forsooth By one's own foolish face betrayed in flame. The little traitor, when she saw me dumb, Went on to clap her hands, till all and each Took up the jest and called on me to come And prove my courage in the manly breach. The imperious queen stood waiting for me there, Pointing and beckoning, and the crowd closed in. Under the cover of a wilder air From the brass band, the darkness and the din, I know not how it was, in fear or fun, I touched that monster's knee, and all was done. XVII I touched that knee. She did not show surprise, And the earth had not opened at our feet. She did not even laugh. Her foolish eyes Twinkled a moment in her cheeks, then set Like fog-bound stars for ever from my sight. And at a signal from the little woman, Who clung to me still, a chorus left and right Of laughter rose Homeric and inhuman, Drowning all further sense in one wild roar. I heard the spotted girl with leopard lips Complain that she was hungry as before, And all the world was merged in an eclipse, Darkening the air around and overhead, And then I broke away and turned and fled. XVIII Alas, poor Queen of Beauty! In my heart I could weep for you and your sad graceless doom. You stand at my life's threshold in the part Of king's chief jester in the ante-room, And none more near the throne. You made us sport According to your folly, and passed on, And now you live with pension in Love's Court, And privilege to jest and wear the crown. Yes, I could weep for you. Your part it was To strike the cymbals on a night sublime For Love's first bridal dance. Alas, alas! Time, the avenger of our manhood's prime, Is gathering all life courtiers to his cell, And you among the rest. So fare you well. XIX I fled the booth with feelings as of Cain, Yet laughing at my own bewilderment. My cheeks had blushed till it was physical pain, And my eyes smarted. Through my head there went The little woman's last appealing word Bidding me stop, in tones that smote afresh. And 'twixt my finger and thumb there throbbed and stirred The semblance of that monstrous pound of flesh, The knee that I had handled. With it too The jet beads of the little woman's skirt, Where I had held her, left an impress new And touched my conscience to a deeper hurt. I was ashamed of all with shame intense, My youth, my frailty, and my innocence. XX I fled into the bosom of the night, Leaving the Fair behind me. I had need Of the sweet healing darkness to my sight, As a bruise needs a poultice. And in speed I went thus half through Lyons, loath to win Back to the crowd, and doubly loath to go Thus foolishly transfigured to my inn. Strange fateful night! Even to this hour 'tis so. Night in a city with the distant hum Of laughing crowds, the silence of strange streets, My own mute footfalls and the redolent gloom Of oil-lit thresholds brings it back and cheats My sorrow still to the last dreams of good I dreamed that evening in my solitude. XXI If I have since done evil in my life, I was not born for evil. This I know. My soul was a thing pure from sensual strife. No vice of the blood foredoomed me to this woe. I did not love corruption. Beauty, truth, Justice, compassion, peace with God and man, These were my laws, the instincts of my youth, And hold me still, conceal it as I can. I did not love corruption, nor do love. I find it ill to hate and ill to grieve. Nature designed me for a life above The mere discordant dreams in which I live. If I now go a beggar on the Earth, I was a saint of Heaven by right of birth. XXII You know the story of my birth, the name Which I inherited for good and ill, The secret of my father's fame and shame, His tragedy and death on that dark hill. You know at least what the world knows or knew, For time has taken half the lookers-on, As it took him, and leaves his followers few, And those that loved him scarce or almost none. To me, his son, there had remained the story, Told and retold by her who knew it best, A mystery of love, perhaps of glory, A heritage to hold and a bequest. Ah, how it loved him, that sad woman's heart, What faith was hers and what a martyr's part! XXIII Nor later, when with her my childhood died, Was life less sealed to me. The Church became My guardian next and mother deified, Who lit within me a more subtle flame Of constancy, and clothed me in her mood. No sound, no voice within that sanctuary Told me of common evil. Unsubdued And vast and strange, a thing from which to flee, The world lay there without us. We within, Fenced in and folded safe in our strong home, Knew nothing of the sorrow and the sin. 'Tis no small matter to have lived in Rome, In the Church's very bosom and abode, Cloistered and cradled there, a child of God. XXIV Thus through these griefs I had been set apart, As for a double priesthood. Life to me, In those first moments when I probed my heart, Less an enchantress seemed than enemy. My knowledge of the world had nothing human. I saw Mankind a tribe, my natural foe, Whom I must one day battle with; and Woman, Ah! Woman was a snare I did not know. Indeed, it may be that already hope Knocked at my soul with tales it dared not own Of woman's kindness in my horoscope. Man, only Man I feared with eyes bent down, Man the oppressor, who with pale lips curled Sheds blood in the high places of the world. XXV My childhood, then, had passed a mystery Shrouded by death, my boyhood a shut thing. The passion of my soul as it grew free With growing youth, a bird with broken wing, Knew nothing of its strength to dare or do, Or, if it dreamed of battle still to come, That was its secret hidden in the blue Of life's great vault of tears which was its doom, A duty of revenge some day for blood. Enough! You know I held me from the press To whom base things are nothing, that I stood Parted from this world's weekday wickedness By a whole legend of romance sublime, Perhaps by the dead virtue of a crime. XXVI I linger on the threshold of my youth. If you could see me now as then I was, A fair-faced frightened boy with eyes of truth Scared at the world yet angry at its laws, Plotting all plots, a blushing Cataline Betrayed by his own cheeks, a misanthrope In love with all things human and divine, The very fool of fortune and high hope, You would deny you knew me. Oh, the days Of our absurd first manhood, rich in force, Rich in desire of happiness and praise Yet impotent in its heroic course, And all for lack of that one worthless thing, Knowledge of life and love and suffering! XXVII At such a time indeed of youth's first morn, There is a heaving of the soul in pain, A mighty labour as of joys unborn, Which grieves it and disquiets it in vain. The soul is scared at her own lack of peace, Her cradle song is mute, and she has fled From her old life as to a wilderness. She finds herself awake and without bread. 'Tis then the body, her new counsellor, Speaks in her ear, and still with eloquence Pleads for more action, and his voice to her Is sweet with love, and sadly she consents. There is a day of youth which needs must come When each must learn his life and leave his home. XXVIII The summer I had passed in my own fashion High in the Alps, a proselyte to toil. I was released and free, and spent my passion On the bare rocks as on a fruitful soil. I had soothed my soul with labour, and its fire Borne to those naked heights where I unfurled My flag with new ambitions, high and higher Even to the last bleak outposts of the world. My soul had needed courage, and behold! Here in these battles with the hosts of air And rock and snow and storm she had grown bold And proved her temper for the coming war. This was her gain, the strife she must engage With physical fear, her childhood's heritage. XXIX A glorious triumph. On that day of days When, standing on the summit's utmost edge Of my first mountain-top, I viewed the maze Which I had travelled upwards, ledge on ledge, And all that wilderness of rock and plain Rolled at my feet, and, when with heel fast set On Nature's neck, I knew the giant slain, My thrall, my prisoner, on the parapet, I was transfigured. Slowly in me rose The throb of courage as a sense new born. “Even Man,” I cried, “Man's self, my foe of foes, The phantom of my fears, shall feel my scorn Yet in a nobler war.” And trembling then I seemed to stand, I too, a man with men. XXX Thus was my soul enfranchised. But anon, With courage fired to full-fledged enterprise, And pushing still the vantage I had won, I sought communion with a world less wise, The living world. I mixed with not a few, Shepherds and countrymen, and village priests, Bagmen at inns, and all the motley crew Which comes and goes on market days and feasts In old-world hostelries of old-world towns. These gave a second schooling, till the grace Of the summer ended on the upper downs, And, carrying still its glory on my face, I came to Lyons where these things befell. The why and wherefore of it who shall tell? XXXI The booths were shut. The Fair was at an end, And the crowd gone with multitudinous feet Noisily home, or lingering still to spend At Café doors or at the turn of the street In twos and threes its laughter with good-night. All turned to silence. Even my heart had peace As, self-possessed and freed from its vain fright, I found myself once more upon the quays. I stopped before the theatre grown dark, With its extinguished lamps and blank repose A scene of melancholy sad to mark, Made sadder too by the white moon which rose Behind it virginal with vaporous wings, Aloof and careless of all earthly things. XXXII I had stopped to read a handbill of the play, Caught by the lettering. Thus it was I read, “Programme of this night's pieces, Saturday The twentieth of October, ‘X. Y. Z.,’ A piece in one act, and ‘Les Bergers Fous,’ These to be followed by the well-known ‘drame’ Of ‘Manon Lescaut,’ here brought out anew For the first time at Lyons.” And a name Followed in giant type of one who then Illustrious stood in all the world of folly, The most sublime Comedian known to men, “Mademoiselle Esther, Muse of Melancholy.” She in her part of Manon, so 'twas writ, Three nights would play in honour infinite. XXXIII Such was the legend. I had read it through Twice ere I thought of thinking what it meant. And as I turned with a sigh because I knew That I alone perhaps of all who went Homewards that night should bid good-night to none, From a side door thrust open on the street And calling as she passed in petulant tone To one within who seemed to rouse her heat, “Ah, mauvais plaisant!” ere she slammed it to, Out stepped my little woman of the Fair. Her face was altered, but its form and hue, If I had doubted in the moonlight there, Was marked for me by that unaltered sign, The little scar, its beauty's underline. XXXIV She saw me in an instant, and stopped short With a sudden change of look from fierce to gay. Her black eyes gleamed with triumph as they caught, Like some wild bird of chase, their natural prey. “Ha, ha,” she cried, “c'est lui, c'est l'ingénu. Ah, vagabond! 'Tis thus you find me out. Standing en faction, and at midnight too, At the actors door, with no more fear or doubt Than any sinner of them all. Oh wise! Who would have guessed it? No. You shall not speak. You shall not soil your innocent lips with lies For any foolish reason in the week, Nor for the year together if you told Your stories here till both of us grew old. XXXV “Silence. I will not listen!” “And for what?” She added strangely, in a softer mood. “You see I am not angry. Do you not? Only soft-hearted, and alas! too good. Why did you follow me?” She took my hand With a sudden action so devoid of guile That I, who could not choose but understand, Was softened too and fooled into a smile. “Why did you follow me? Here, feel,” she said, “How my heart beats. It frightens me to find So much of cunning in so young a head, So young a heart,—and mine which is not blind!” She pressed my hand to her side. In truth, her heart Was beating there, my own heart's counterpart. XXXVI She watched me curiously with mocking eyes, Yet tenderly, till once again her mirth Prevailed with her, and quick in feigned surprise Thrusting me back, “Ah, traitor!” she broke forth, “'Twas not for me then you were waiting there, Not me, poor foolish me. The Queen of Love, The woman of the booth! She was your care! Monster! to dare me thus! And yet you prove Your wit in vain, for, look, you foolish boy, She cannot walk the streets like you and me, Or the town would be at her heels.” Convulsed with joy At this new jest she laughed remorselessly, Till I was almost angry and inclined To leave her there. And then she changed her mind. XXXVII She seemed to change as if with a change of the wind, And growing serious sighed, “Now look,” she said, “You think me a mad woman and unkind, But that is nonsense. I am sound of head And not unsound of heart, ah, no, not there! But you turn my head with your John the Baptist's face. I will not be made jealous, so beware.” She looked entreatingly as if for grace, And held me by the arm. “We are strangers both Among these heavy Lyonnese. By right We so should hold together. Tell me truth. You never saw me, did you, till to-night?” I said, “I came here not twelve hours ago! Why should you think it?” “No,” she broke in, “no. XXXVIII “I do not doubt it. You have a look of truth Which is beyond suspicion. But the world Is as full of knaves as fools. You have your youth And I my wisdom. Then your head is curled Just as I like it, and your face is smooth, And it can blush like your red innocent hands. I saw it in an instant in the booth That we should know each other and be friends. It does not do to question. Look at me. I am not pretty, yet the world's best sense Has raved about my beauty foolishly These five years past in every mood and tense! Say. Would you like we should be friends for good?” Not knowing what I said, I said I would. XXXIX “We shall be friends. How friends? You must know me first. What? Like the Pont Neuf? Should you wish it? Well, None ever yet repented it who durst. Oh! you shall know me as I dare not tell. You said I was not pretty. 'Tis the paint That ruins the complexion and the hours Spent at the footlights. These would rob a saint, Much more a sinner, of her natural powers. Voilà la casse du métier! Then, this scar, Some praise it as a beauty. They are fools. At best it but an honour is of war, And beauty is not measured by foot-rules. So you forgive it me, what need we care? Fair faces are but signs of things more fair.” XL She went on talking like a running stream, Without more reason or more pause or stay Than to gather breath and then pursue her whim Just where it led her, tender, sad, or gay. Her moods seemed all alike to her. But soon With a little shudder, for the wind was chill And we had lingered on there in the moon, She bade me follow, and I bowed my will. The torrent of her words had drowned in me What humour of resistance there had been, And the last sense of danger ceased to be In the first joy of yielding to such sin. There is no pleasure in the world so sweet As, being wise, to fall at folly's feet. XLI Who might describe the humours of that night, The mirth, the tragedy, the grave surprise, The treasures of fair folly infinite Learned as a lesson from those childlike eyes? When we had left our river of fair hope, The world once more engulfed us in its ways, And street on street we passed, and shop on shop, Still loitering by to peer within and praise. At each new stall we stopped as if in doubt, Asking a price, and in pretence to buy. I thought she would have worn men's patience out With her fool's talk while I stood idly by. And still, as each grew warm, with cunning word She turned their wrath from surly to absurd. XLII And so we went our way,—yes, hand in hand, Like two lost children in some magic wood Baffled and baffling with enchanter's wand The various beasts that crossed us and withstood. Each step was an experience. Every mood Of that fair woman a fresh gospelling, Which spoke aloud to me and stirred my blood To a new faith, I knew not with what sting. One thing alone I knew or cared to know, Her strange companionship thus strangely won. The past, the future, all of weal or woe In my old life was gone, for ever gone. And still to this I clung as one who clings To hope's last hencoop in the wreck of things. XLIII How shall I tell my fall? The life of man Is but a tale of tumbles, this way thrown At his beginning by mere haste of plan In the first gaping ditch with flowers o'ergrown; Anon more cautious for his wounded knees, Yet falling still through much expectancy; And so to age, the goal of his heart's ease, Stumbling in blindness on he knows not why. How shall I tell it? As the poets tell Who wrap love in a garment of vain light? Or plainly naked, the poor child of Hell And laughter that it is and starless night? I like the truth best. Yet this love, sad thing, Mired and defiled, I saw it once a king. XLIV We came at last, alas! I see it yet, With its open windows on the upper floor, To a certain house still stirring, with lights set, And just a chink left open of the door. Here my companion stopped and bade me in; Her dressmaker's, she said. And I, who heard A sound of women's voices from within, Shrank back alarmed and ready at a word From any damsel stoutly to deny. But “Madame Blanche,” she said to ease my fears, “Is a good soul, and far too wise to pry Or fancy evil of her customers At any hour of the night they choose to come, Much less of me.” And so I followed dumb. XLV I followed dumb and shrinking like a thief Close in her shadow from the women's guess, Yet ruthlessly betrayed for my cheeks' grief From head to foot in the tall pier-glasses. My vagabond attire, my coat all rags, My tattered plaid stained with the summer's dust, The sash which bound my waist all gaps and jags, With gaiters frayed and such sad shoes as must Have served Ulysses at his journey's close; All these I saw revealed to my disgrace, My hat still crowned with its last Alpine rose, And what she had called my “John the Baptist's face” Red with confusion and the rage of youth, I saw it all, the whole remorseless truth. XLVI Not so my little sponsor. She, with eyes Proudly unconscious of my fool's display, Talked volubly to all and scorned disguise, While Madame Blanche herself, no less than they, Smiled us a welcome, and with upraised hands Disclaimed excuse and led us straightway through To an inner room as to a Conference. There I first saw to my amazement new That fair white mystery, a woman's dress, And heard its language spoken. Stuffs were brought And cards unrolled before us, braids and lace Lauded and handled and their merits taught To ears that listened and to eyes that saw Their secret sense, the law within the law. XLVII Sublime discussions! Let who will be wise! These are the things that touch us and transcend. The logic of all beauty is surprise, The reason of all love the unseen end. Still as they argued on of this and that, Turning perchance to me as arbiter Where in my corner I still speechless sat To end their strife, my vision seemed to clear, The scales fell from my eyes of ignorance, The terror from my heart. One thing alone Stood plain before me, the supreme fair chance Of a first fortune, glorious and unknown, Which beckoned me with no uncertain hand To touch and taste and learn and understand. XLVIII Suddenly then my strange companion cried, “Bring me the body.” In a moment more She had thrown off her hat, her veil untied, And motioning all the women to the door, While I sat speechless by who would have gone, Undid her jacket and anon her dress, With the jet buttons of it one by one, And stood but clothed the more in loveliness, A sight sublime, a dream, a miracle, A little goddess from some luminous field Brought down unconscious on our Earth to dwell, And in an age of innocence revealed, Naked but not ashamed. Nay, wherefore shame? And I, ah, who shall blame me, who shall blame? XLIX I will not tell the secrets of that place. When Madame Blanche returned to us again I was kneeling there, while Esther kissed my face And dried and comforted my tears. O vain And happy tears! O griefs thrice comforted! I trembled, but not with fear. If I was dumb, 'Twas not for lack of speech where all was said. My doubts were ended and my fears o'ercome, And joy had triumphed. Life has given me much And pleasure much, and Heaven may yet have store Of nobler hopes to kindle and to touch, But never for all time, ah, never more, That delicate dawn of wonder when lips move First to the love of life and love of love. L He who has once been happy is for aye Out of destruction's reach. His fortune then Holds nothing secret, and Eternity, Which is a mystery to other men, Has like a woman given him its joy. Time is his conquest. Life, if it should fret, Has paid him tribute. He can bear to die. He who has once been happy! When I set The world before me and survey its range, Its mean ambitions, its scant fantasies, The shreds of pleasure which for lack of change Men wrap around them and call happiness, The poor delights which are the tale and sum Of the world's courage in its martyrdom; LI When I hear laughter from a tavern door, When I see crowds agape and in the rainWatching on tiptoe and with stifled roar To see a rocket fired or a bull slain, When misers handle gold, when orators Touch strong men's hearts with glory till they weep, When cities deck their streets for barren wars Which have laid waste their youth, and when I keep Calmly the count of my own life and see On what poor stuff my manhood's dreams were fed Till I too learned what dole of vanity Will serve a human soul for daily bread, —Then I remember that I once was young And lived with Esther the world's gods among. LII I lived with Esther, not for many days, If days be counted by the fall of night And the sun's rising, yet through years of praise, If truth be timepiece of joys infinite. And what a life it was! No vain sweet dream Of love in idleness which all men know, But a full drama fashioned on the theme Of strength victorious over death and woe. Here was no faltering. Ours the triumph was Of that strong logic which beholds each day As a new world to conquer, and the cause Itself complete of a more glorious fray. To-day our cycle was. In it sublime We sat enthroned as on the neck of Time. LIII For Esther was a woman most complete In all her ways of loving. And with me Dealt as one deals who careless of deceit And rich in all things is of all things free. She did not stop with me to feel her way Into my heart, because she all hearts knew, But, like some prodigal heir of yesterday Just in possession, counted not her due And grandly gave. O brave humility! O joy that kneels! O pride that stoops to tears! She spent where others had demanded fee, Served where all service had of right been hers, Casting her bread of life upon love's ways, Content to find it after many days. LIV I must not speak of it. Even yet my heart Is but a feeble thing to fret and cry, And it might chance to wake and with a start, When nights were still and stars were in the sky, Sit up and muse upon its lonely state, With the same stars to mock at it as then, And certain chords that touched might touch it yet, And griefs find issue and tears come again. I must not venture farther in this mood. Grief is forsworn to me. I will not grieve, Nor think too much on Esther's womanhood, Rather on that which was its make-believe. And yet awhile she loved me. In this thought I long found rest when all was come to nought. LV We stayed at Lyons three days, only three, In Esther's world of wonder and renown, She, glorious star, each night immortally Playing her Manons to the listening town. I glorious too, but in Love's firmament, Watching her face by which alone I moved, A shadow near her raptured and intent, And seeking still the signs that I was loved. Thrice happy days! Thrice blessed tragedy! Her Des Grieux was I, her lover lorn Bound to her fortunes, blest to live or die, And faithful ever though to faith forsworn, Waiting behind the scenes in that stage-land To greet her exits and to squeeze her hand. LVI Who has not wept with Manon? Of all tales That thrill youth's fancy or to tears or mirth None other is there where such grief prevails, Such passionate pity for the loves of Earth. Who has not wept with Manon in her sin, Wept in her punishment? What angry heart Has been unmoved in youth to see her win With those sad archers to the inhuman cart? Who has not followed her beyond the seas, And sold his life for her, and bowed his pride, And sinned all sins to buy her back to ease, And died all deaths to venge her when she died? And I, blest boy, who each new happy night When all was done still lived in her delight! LVII This was my term of glory. All who know Something of life will guess untold the end. In love, one ever kisses for his woe, One lends his cheek, alas! or seems to lend, One has the pleasure, one the penalties, One is in earnest, one has time to laugh, One turns impatient from imploring eyes, And one in terror spells love's epitaph. There was no wisdom in this love of mine, Therefore it perished earlier than the rest, Although I poured out all my heart like wine And watered it with tears, and prayed unblest In my soul's rage to all the Saints of heaven To give me this and yet to be forgiven. LVIII It might not be. Some things are possible, And some impossible for even God. And Esther had no soul which Heaven or Hell Could touch by joy or soften by the rod. She could not really love me. The day came, How soon, how late, I need not to devise, When passion prayed its last, and only shame Stood for my portion in a world grown wise, And I went forth for ever from her sight Knowing the good and evil. On that day I did her wrong by anger. Now life's light Illumines all, and I behold her gay As I first knew her in my love purblind, Dear passionate Esther, soulless but how kind! THE LOVE SONNETS OF PROTEUS DEDICATION To Robert, Lord Lytton 1880 I TO ONE IN A HIGH POSITION To you, a poet, glorious, heaven-born, One who is not a poet but a son Of the earth earthy, sick and travel-worn And weary with a race already run, A battle lost e'er yet his day is done, Comes with this tribute, shattered banners torn From a defeat. You reign in Macedon, My Alexander, as at earlier morn You reigned upon Parnassus, hero, king. I reign no more, not even in those hearts For which these songs were made, and if I sing 'Tis with a harsh and melancholy note At which my own heart like an echo starts. Yet sometimes I can deem you listening, And then all else is instantly forgot. PART I.—TO MANON II COMPARING HER TO A FALCON Brave as a falcon and as merciless, With bright eyes watching still the world, thy prey, I saw thee pass in thy lone majesty, Untamed, unmated, high above the press. The dull crowd gazed at thee. It could not guess The secret of thy proud aërial way, Or read in thy mute face the soul which lay A prisoner there in chains of tenderness. —Lo, thou art captured. In my hand to-day I hold thee, and awhile thou deignest to be Pleased with my jesses. I would fain beguile My foolish heart to think thou lovest me. See, I dare not love thee quite. A little while And thou shalt sail back heavenwards. Woe is me! III ON HIS FORTUNE IN LOVING HER I did not choose thee, dearest. It was Love That made the choice, not I. Mine eyes were blind As a rude shepherd's who to some lone grove His offering brings, and cares not at what shrine He bends his knee. The gifts alone were mine; The rest was Love's. He took me by the hand, And fired the sacrifice, and poured the wine, And spoke the words I might not understand. I was unwise in all but the dear chance Which was my fortune, and the blind desire Which led my foolish steps to Love's abode, And youth's sublime unreasoned prescience Which raised an altar and inscribed in fire Its dedication: “To the unknown god.” IV IN PRAISE OF HIS FATE When I hear others speak of this and that In our fools' lives which might have better gone, Complaining idly of too niggard fate And wishing still their senseless past undone, I feel a childish tremor through me run, Stronger than reason, lest by some far chance Fate's ear to our sad plaints should yet be won And these our lives be thrown back on our hands. I tremble when I think of my past years, My hopes, my aims, my wishes. All these days I might have wandered far from Love and thee. But kind fate held me, heedless of my prayers, A prisoner to its wise mysterious ways, And forced me to thy feet—ah fortunate me! V ON THE POWER OF HER BEAUTY I am lighthearted now. An hour ago There was a tempest in my heaven, a flame Of sullen lightning under a bent brow And a dull muttering which breathed no name. Now all is changed. The very winds are tame, And the birds sing aloud from every bough, And my heart leaps. What empire dost thou claim, Child, o'er this Earth, that nature serves thee so? Sublime magician! Well may Earth and Heaven Change at thy bidding, and the hearts of men. Didst thou but know the power that beauty hath, The sea should leave his bed, the rocks be riven, And wise men, deeming chaos come again, Should kneel before thee and conjure thy wrath. VI DEPRECIATING HER BEAUTY I love not thy perfections. When I hear Thy beauty blazoned, and the common tongue Cheapening with vulgar praise a lip, an ear, A cheek that I have prayed to;—when among The loud world's gods my god is noised and sung, Her wit applauded, even her taste, her dress, Her each dear hidden marvel lightly flung At the world's feet and stripped to nakedness— Then I despise thy beauty utterly, Crying, “Be these your gods, O Israel!” And I remember that on such a day I found thee with eyes bleared and cheeks all pale, And lips that trembled to a voiceless cry, And that thy bosom in my bosom lay. VII ON HER VANITY What are these things thou lovest? Vanity. To see men turn their heads when thou dost pass; To be the signboard and the looking-glass Where every idler there may glut his eye; To hear men speak thy name mysteriously, Wagging their heads. Is it for this, alas, That thou hast made a placard of a face On which the tears of love were hardly dry? What are these things thou lovest? The applause Of prostitutes at wit which is not thine; The sympathy of shop-boys who would weep Their shilling's worth of woe in any cause, At any tragedy.—Their tears and mine, What difference? Oh truly tears are cheap! VIII AS TO HIS CHOICE OF HER If I had chosen thee, thou shouldst have been A virgin proud, untamed, immaculate, Chaste as the morning star, a saint, a queen, Scarred by no wars, no violence of hate. Thou shouldst have been of soul commensurate With thy fair body, brave and virtuous And kind and just; and, if of poor estate, At least an honest woman for my house. I would have had thee come of honoured blood And honourable nurture. Thou shouldst bear Sons to my pride and daughters to my heart, And men should hold thee happy, wise, and good. Lo, thou art none of this, but only fair. Yet must I love thee, dear, and as thou art. IX ON HER WAYWARDNESS This is rank slavery. It better were To till the thankless earth with sweat of brow, Following dull oxen 'neath a goad of care To a boor's grave agape behind the plough. It better were to linger in some slow Unnatural case, the sport of flood or fire, To be undone by some inhuman vow And robbed in youth of youth and its desire. It better were to perish than thus live Thy pensioner and bondsman, day by day Doing fool's service thus for love of thee. How shall I save thee if thou wilt not grieve Even for shames like these? How shall I slay The foes thou lovest, thou, their enemy? X ON HER FORGIVENESS OF A WRONG This is not virtue. To forgive were great If love were in the issue and not gold. But wrongs there are 'tis treason to forget, And to forgive before the deed was cold Was a strange jest. Ah, Manon, you have sold The keys of heaven at a vulgar rate, A sum of money for the wealth untold Of a just anger and the right to hate. —Well. It is done and the price paid. Now make Haste to betray them as you me betrayed. These are no longer foes to be forgiven. Remember they are friends, that peace is made, That you are theirs. Then rend them for love's sake, And let your hatred with your love be even. XI ON HER LIGHTHEARTEDNESS I would I had thy courage, dear, to face This bankruptcy of love, and greet despair With smiling eyes and unconcerned embrace, And these few words of banter at “dull care.” I would that I could sing and comb my hair Like thee the morning thro', and choose my dress, And gravely argue what I best should wear, A shade of ribbon or a fold of lace. I would I had thy courage and thy peace, Peace passing understanding; that mine eyes Could find forgetfulness like thine in sleep; That all the past for me like thee could cease And leave me cheerfully, sublimely wise, Like David with washed face who ceased to weep. XII ON READING CERTAIN LETTERS Reading these lines, this record of lost days Where I am not, and yet where love has been, This tale of passions consecrate to men Other than me, unwitting of my ways, I seem to hear some pagan chaunt of praise Hymned to an idol shrine in gardens green, Some wild soft worship of a god obscene, Some idle homage to an idol face. I shut my ears, yet hear it still. My eyes See not, yet see the unchaste the unlawful fire; I scent the odour of the sacrifice, And feel the victim's shriek. Then in my ire I rise up, as on Horeb, and I cry, “There is none other god, but only I!” XIII HE DARES NOT DIE Four hours by the clock! How strange it is! Four hours Since love and life, the future and the past, Died with the shutting of these silent doors, And thought became to me one purpose vast. I have not moved from where she sat. The cast Of her fingers on this cushion lightly scores Its surface still; and still I hear the last Tones of her laughter, and here lie her flowers. Poor flowers! The ugliness of grief has wrought Your change already. No besotted bloom Of a false dawn has lured you to base life. You at the pinch were brave and trifled not, Going ungrudging to our common doom. And I? Ah God! I have not faced the knife! XIV HE HAS FALLEN FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS LOVE Love, how ignobly hast thou met thy doom! Ill-seasoned scaffolding by which, full-fraught With passionate youth and mighty hopes, we clomb To our heart's heaven, fearing, doubting, naught! Oh love, thou wert too frail for such mad sport, Too rotten at thy core, designed too high: And we who trusted thee our death have bought, And bleeding on the ground must surely die. —I will not see her. What she now may be I care not. For the dream within my brain Is fairer, nobler, and more kind than she; And with that vision I can mock at pain. God! Was there ever woman half so sweet, Or death so bitter, or at such dear feet? XV COMPLAINING THAT HE HAD FALLEN AMONG THIEVES Oh, Lytton, I have gambled with my soul, And, like a spendthrift, pawned my heritage To pitiless Jews, and paid a monstrous toll To knaves and usurers,—and all to wage Fair war with black-legs, men who dared to gauge My youth's bright honour as an antique thing, A broadsword to their fencing point and edge. So the game went. And even yet I cling To my mad humour, reckoning up each stake, Each fair coin lost.—O miserable slaves, Who for the sake of gold, the poorest thing Man ever won from the earth's bosom, take To rope or poison, and who labour not Even to “dig dishonourable graves,” See one who has lost a pound for every groat, For every penny of your squandering! XVI HE ARGUES WITH HIS LIFE My life, what strange mad garments hast thou on, Now that I see thee truly and am wise! Thou wild, lost Proteus, strangling and undone! What shapes are these, what metamorphoses Of a god's soul in pain? I hear thy cries And see thee writhe and take fantastic forms, And strike in blindness at the destinies And at thyself, and at thy brother worms. Ah, foolish worm, thou canst not change thy lot, And all like thee must perish 'neath the sun. Why struggle with thy fellows? Nay, be kind, Kinder than these. Behold, the flower-pot Of fate is emptied out, and one by one The fisher takes you, and his hooks are blind. XVII JOY'S TREACHERY I had a live joy once and pampered her, For I had brought her from the “golden East,” To lie when nights were cold upon my breast And sit beside me the long days and purr, Until her whole soul should be lapped in fur, Deep as her claws; a beautiful sleek beast, Which I might love.—But, when I deemed it least, Her topaz eyes were on my stomacher, Athirst for blood. Thus, for I loathed her since I learned her guile, one night I had her slain And thrown upon a dunghill to the flies, Who bred in her fair limbs a pestilence, Whereof I sickened.—Thus it ever is: Dead joys unburied breed us death and pain. XVIII HE LAMENTS THAT HIS LOVE IS DEAD My love is dead, dead and in spite of me,— Dead while I lived,—while yet my blood was rife With hope and pleasure and the pride of life. For my love ended unexpectedly During the Winter, stricken like a tree By a night's cold, and frozen to the blood, Whose leaves fell off and never were renewed By any promise of the years to be. And, when the Spring came, and the birds, to mate Among its branches, lo! they found it bare, Though all around was Summer in the wood. Yet they took heart awhile, incredulous That such a tree should be for ever dead. “'Tis early yet,” they cried. “The Spring is late. It shall still be as in the days that were.” But Summer came and went while the tree stood Bare in the sun like a deserted house. —Then the birds suddenly despaired and fled. XIX HE PROTESTS, NOTWITHSTANDING, HIS LOVE To be cast forth from the fair light of heaven Into the outer darkness and there lie, Through unrecorded years of agony, Unseen, unheard, unpitied, unforgiven; To be forgotten of the earth and sky, Forgotten of the womb that once did bear, The eyes that cheered, the voice that comforted, The very breast where love had laid his head; To be alone with darkness and despair, Alone with endless death, and not to die: All these be punishments within the hand Of an avenging deity to deal. To these I bow in weakness as behoves. Yet not in anger but in love I stand 'Gainst heaven, a new Prometheus, and appeal From God to my own soul which ceaseless loves. His be the wrath, the burning and the rod. Hell shall not make me traitor to my God. XX ON FALLING ILL THROUGH GRIEF Truce to thee, Soul! I have a debt to pay, Which I acknowledge and without thy pleading. I like thee little that thou barrest my way With prayers too late for one well past thy heeding, Truce to these tears! Thy fellow lieth bleeding, Wounded by thee; and thou, forsooth, dost say, “I have a servant who is sick and needing Care at men's hands.” The care was thine to pay. —When this same Soul was sick, a while ago, The Body watched her, till his eyes grew dim And his cheeks pale for very sympathy, Because she grieved. His love has wrought him woe, For he is sick and she despiseth him. Poor Body, I must take some thought of thee. XXI HIS BONDAGE TO MANON IS BROKEN From this day forth I lead another life, Another life! A life without a tear! To-day has ended the unequal strife; My service and my sorrow finish here. See, my soul cuts her cable of belief And sails towards the ocean. She shall steer Sublime henceforth o'er accidents of grief. Her storm has rolled to a new Hemisphere. I have loved too much, too loyally, too long. To-day I am a pirate of the sea. Let others suffer. I have suffered wrong. Let others love, and love as tenderly. Oh, Manon, there are women yet unborn Shall rue thy frailty, else am I forsworn. PART II.—JULIET XXII ON THE NATURE OF LOVE You ask my love. What shall my love then be ? A hope, an aspiration, a desire? The soul's eternal charter writ in fire Upon the earth, the heavens, and the sea? You ask my love. The carnal mystery Of a soft hand, of finger-tips that press, Of eyes that kindle and of lips that kiss, Of sweet things known to thee and only thee? You ask my love. What love can be more sweet Than hope or pleasure? Yet we love in vain. The soul is more than joy, the life than meat. The sweetest love of all were love in pain, And that I will not give. So let it be. —Nay, give me any love, so it be love of thee. XXIII ASKING FOR HER HEART Give me thy heart, Juliet, give me thy heart! I have a need of it, an absolute need, Because my own heart has thus long been dead. I live but by thy life. The very smart Of this new pain which has been born of thee Is thine, thy own great pleasure's counterpart. I stand before thee naked. Clothe thou me. Bring out a robe,—thy truth, thy chastity. Put rings upon my fingers,—honour's meed. For thou canst give, nor ever reck the cost, Being the royal creature that thou art, The fountain of all honour, whose high boast Is to be greatest when thou givest most. XXIV THE SAME CONTINUED Give me thy soul, Juliet, give me thy soul! I am a bitter sea, which drinketh in The sweetness of all waters, and so thine. Thou, like a river, pure and swift and full And freighted with the wealth of many lands, With hopes, and fears, and death and life, dost roll Against the troubled ocean of my sin. Thou doubtest not, though on these desert sands The billows surge against thee black with brine, Unwearied. For thy love is fixed and even And bears thee onward, and thy faith is whole. Though thou thyself shouldst sin, yet surely Heaven Hath held thee guiltless and thou art forgiven. XXV THE SAME CONTINUED Give me thy kiss, Juliet, give me thy kiss! I with my body worship thee and vow Such service to thy needs as man can do. I ask no nobler servitude than this. Am I not thine, the bondsman of thy love, Whom thou hast bought and ransomed with a price, And therefore worthy to be ranked above The very stars that in the heavens move? And, Juliet, since I thus am one with you, And kinglier than Plantagenet or Guelph, What price were meet for my high mightiness? What gold of joy, what hope, what heavenly pelf Hast thou to give? Nay, sweetest, give thyself. XXVI THE SAME—A CHRISTMAS SONNET Since thou hast given me these, Juliet, given me these, There have been tidings told of a great joy, Of peace on Earth, good-will without annoy. Thou hast put on my soul's infirmities And stooped to succour me, and thou hast trod The way of sorrows with me, on thy knees, Making thyself a little less than God, That I might worship him in womanhood, A new redemption. Therefore, Juliet, The choirs of Heaven multitudinous Make all their songs to thee this happy night, In praise of thy great love incarnate thus, A very “word made flesh” to dwell with us. XXVII ASKING THE FULFILMENT OF HER LOVE I ask for love who famished am in plenty, Not scorning the dear manna of your tears But being vexed with that too froward twenty Which heads the sum of my rebellious years. My soul is fallen “in lust of cucumbers, Of fish, of melons,” through its long abstaining. Unworthy Egypt yet enslaves my fears. Ah, love, I thirst, but not for heaven's raining. Why speak to me, alas, of heavenly joys Who ask for joys of earth these cannot cheat? What are these clouds, these pillars of fire to me? The wilderness is long. Youth cannot be For ever fed on these unnatural toys And needs must murmur if it have not meat. XXVIII IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION Why should I hate you, love, or why despise For that last proof of tenderness you gave? The battle is not always to the brave, Nor life's sublimest wisdom to the wise. True courage often is in frightened eyes, And reason in sweet lips that only rave. There is a weakness stronger than the grave, And blood poured out has overcome the skies. —Nay, love, I honour you the more for this, That you have rent the veil, and ushered in A fellow soul to your soul's holy place. And why should either blush that we have been One day in Eden, in our nakedness? —'Tis conscience makes us sinners, not our sin. XXIX TO HER WHO WOULD COMFORT HIM I did not ask your pity, dear. Your zeal I know. It cannot cure me of my woes. And you, in your sweet happiness, who knows, Deserve it rather I should pity feel For what the coming years from you conceal. I did but cry, thou dear Samaritan, Out of my bitterness of soul. Each man Has his own sorrow treading on his heel, Ready to strike him, and must keep his shield To his own back. Fate's arrows thickly fly, And, if they strike not now, will strike at even. And so I ask no pity. On life's field The wounded crawl together, but their cry Is not to one another but to Heaven. XXX THE RELIGION OF LOVE So thou but love me, dear, with thy whole heart What care I for the rest, for good or ill? What for the peace of soul good deeds impart, What for the tears unholy dreams distil? These cannot make my joy, nor shall they kill. Thou only perfect peace and virtue art And holiness for me and strength and will, So thou but love me with a perfect heart. I ask thee now no longer to be wise; No longer to be good, but loving me. I ask thee nothing now but only this. Henceforth my Bible, dear, shall be thine eyes, My beads thy lips, my prayers thy constancy, My heaven thine arms, eternity thy kiss. XXXI TO ONE WHO LOVED HIM I cannot love you, love, as you love me, In singleness of soul, and faith untried: I have no faith in any destiny, In any Heaven, even at your side. Our hearts are all too weak, the world too wide, You but a woman. If I dare to give Some thought, some tenderness, a little pride, A little love, 'tis yours, love, to receive. And do not grieve, though now the gift appear A drop to your love's ocean. Time shall see. —Oh, I could prophesy:—That day is sure, Though not perhaps this week, nor month, nor year, When your great love shall clean forgotten be, And my poor tenderness shall yet endure. 'Tis not the trees that make the tallest show, Which stand out stoutest when the tempests blow. XXXII EXHORTING HER TO PATIENCE Why do we fret at the inconstancy Of our frail hearts, which cannot always love? Time rushes onward, and we mortals move Like waifs upon a river, neither free To halt nor hurry. Sweet, if destiny Throws us together for an hour, a day, In the back-water of this quiet bay, Let us rejoice. Before us lies the sea, Where we must all be lost in spite of love. We dare not stop to question. Happiness Lies in our hand unsought, a treasure trove. Time has short patience of man's vain distress; And fate grows angry at too long delay; And floods rise fast, and we are swept away. XXXIII REMINDING HER OF A PROMISE Oh, Juliet, we have quarrelled with our fate, And fate has struck us. Wherefore do we cry? We prayed for liberty, and now too late Find liberty is this, to say “good-bye.” The Winter which we loved not has gone by, And Spring is come. The gardens, which were bare When we first wandered through them, you and I, The prisoners of our own vain wishes, are Now full of golden flowers. The very lane Down to the sea is green. The cactus hedge We saw cut down has sprouted new again, And swallows have their nests on the cliff's edge Where we so often sat and dared complain Because our joy was new, and called it pain. XXXIV THE SAME CONTINUED Yes, Spring is come, but joy alas is gone,— Gone ere we knew it, while our foolish eyes, Which should have watched its motions every one Were looking elsewhere, at the hills, the skies, Chasing vain thoughts, as children butterflies, Until the hour struck and the day was done, And we looked up in passionate surprise To find that clouds had blotted out our sun. Our joys are gone. And what is left to us, Who loved not even love when it was here? What but a voice which sobs monotonous As these sad waves upon the rocks, the dear Fond voice which once made music with our own, And which our hearts now ache to think upon. XXXV THE SAME CONTINUED Old memories are sweet, but these are new And smart like wounds yet green. But one there is Which, for the cause that it was dear to you In days which counted upon greater bliss, Is fairer now and dearer far than these; And this the memory is of some hours spent One afternoon when, seated at your knees, I made narration (it was middle Lent And you with Judas flowers had filled your lap), Of the wise secret of these rhymes of mine, And gave a promise, which behold I keep, To write them out for you, each idle line, Throwing you all my rubbish in one heap. Poor stuff perhaps. And yet it made you weep. XXXVI FEAR HAS CAST OUT LOVE 'Tis not that love is less or sorrow more Than in the days when first these things began. Even then you doubted, and our hearts were sore And you rebelled because I was a man. Even then you fought and wrestled with my plan Of earthly bliss. What bitter anguish too When at the hour decreed our passion ran Out of our keeping and love claimed its due! 'Tis not love's fault we part, or grief's. Alas, One mightier now compels us with His nod. The fire of Heaven has touched us, and we pass From pleasure's chastenings to a fiercer rod; And fear has cast out love, for flesh is grass And we are withered with the wrath of God. XXXVI TO ONE WHO WOULD “REMAIN FRIENDS” What is this prate of friendship? Kings discrowned Go forth, not citizens but outlawed men. If love has ceased to give a loyal sound, Let there at least be silence. Once again I go, proscribed, exiled, dominionless Out of your coasts, yet scorning to complain. I grudge not your allegiance nor my bliss, I yield the pleasure as I keep the pain. Rebellion's rights are limited though strong. The right to take gives not the right to give. Mine were the sole right and prerogative To give a title or forgive a wrong. This gift of friendship was not yours to bring. As I have lived in love I still will live Or die, if needs must, and without reprieve, Your lover yet, and kingdomless a king. XXXVIII TO ONE NOW ESTRANGED Why did you love me? Was it not enough That the world loved you, all the world and I? Or was your heart of so sublime a stuff That it might trifle with inconstancy And love and cease to love and yet not die? Heaven was your throne by right of happiness And Earth your footstool. All things great and high Waited your bidding, love itself no less. Yet, if you deigned to love, if from your place In Heaven you stooped, if, when your heart was moved, A thrill of human pleasure tinged your face, If 'twas in weakness not in strength you loved, Then there was cause to blush. Yet, loving, how Shall you blush less to be apostate now? XXXIX FAREWELL TO JULIET Juliet, farewell. I would not be forgiven Even if I forgave. These words must be The last between us two in Earth or Heaven, The last and bitterest. You are henceforth free For ever from my bitter words and me. You shall not at my hand be further vexed With either love, reproach or jealousy (So help me Heaven), in this world or the next. Our souls are single for all time to come And for eternity, and this farewell Is as the trumpet note, the crack of doom, Which heralds an eternal silence. Hell Has no more fixed and absolute decree. And Heaven and Hell may meet,—yet never we. XL THE SAME CONTINUED 'Tis strange we are thus parted, not by death Or man's device, but by our own mad will, We who have stood together on life's path Through half a youth of good repute and ill, Friends more than lovers. See, Love's citadel We held so stoutly 'gainst a world in arms Lies all dismantled now, a sight to fill The Earth with lamentations and alarms. Whose was the fault? I dare not ask nor say. If there was treachery, 'tis best untold. The price of treason we receive to-day Is paid to both of us in evil gold. Ay, take thy bitter freedom. 'Tis the fee Of love betrayed and faith's apostasy. XLI THE SAME CONTINUED We may not meet. I could not for pride's sake Dissemble further, and I suffer pain, A palpable distinct and physical ache, When our eyes meet by accident, and when I hear you talk in your pathetic strain Which always moved me. Only yesterday, As I was standing with a crowd of men In the long corridor, you came my way And chanced to stop, and thus by chance I heard A score of phrases uttered in that sad Half-suppliant voice which once my spirit stirred To its foundations. Yet your theme was glad— Strangers your hearers. What was in these spells To move me still? A trick, and nothing else! XLII THE SAME CONTINUED We vex each other with our presence, I By my regrets and by my mocking face, You by your laughter and mad gaiety, And both by cruel thoughts of happier days. Is then the world so narrow that we pace These streets like prisoners still with eyes askance, As bound together in the fell embrace Of a dark chain which bars deliverance? Nay, go your ways. I will not vex you more. Make your own terms with life, while you are fair. There is none better learned in woman's lore. You yet may take revenge on grief and care, And 'twas your nature ever to be gay, Why should I scoff? Be merry while you may. XLIII THE SAME CONTINUED I do not love you. To have said this once Had seemed to both of us a monstrous lie, An idle boast, love's last extravagance Or the mere paradox of vanity. Now it is true and yet more hideously More strangely monstrous. I, no less than you, Here own at length the worm which cannot die, The burden of a pain for ever new. This is the “pang of loss,” the bitterest Which Hell can give. We are shut out from Heaven And never more shall look upon Love's face, Being with those who perish unforgiven. Never to see Love's face! Ah, pain in pain, Which we do well to weep and weep again! XLIV THE SAME CONTINUED Yet we shall live without love, as some live Without their limbs, their senses, maimed or deaf. We even shall forget love, and shall thrive And prosper and grow fat upon our grief. You are consoled already more than half, And wear your sorrow lightly. I will boast No longer the refusal of relief Than as a decent mourner of hopes crossed. We yet shall laugh, and laughter is more loud When following tears. The men who drive a hearse Are not the least lighthearted of the crowd. See, we have made love's epitaph in verse And fairly buried him. God's ways are best. Then home to pleasure and the funeral feast. XLV THE SAME CONTINUED Do you remember how I laughed at you In the Beaulieu woods, and how I made my peace? It was your thirtieth birthday, and you threw Stones like a school-girl at the chestnut trees. The heavens were light above us and the breeze. Your Corydon and all the merry crew Had wandered to a distance, busier bees Than we, who cared not where the hazels grew. We were alone at last. I had been teasing You with the burden of years left behind. You were too fair to find my wit displeasing, And I too tender to be less than kind. Your pebbles struck me. “Wretch,” I cried. The word Entered our hearts that instant like a sword. XLVI THE SAME CONTINUED Thrice happy fools! What wisdom shall we learn In this world or the next, if next there be, More deep, more full, more worthy our concern Than that first word of folly taught us? We Had suddenly grown silent. I could see Your cheek had lost a little of its hue, And your lips trembled, and beseechingly Your blue eyes turned to mine, and well I knew Your woman's instinct had divined my speech, The meaning of a word so lightly spoken. The word was a confession, clear to each, A pledge as plain and as distinct a token As that of Peter at his master's knees, “Thou knowest that I love thee more than these.” XLVII THE SAME CONTINUED I see you, Juliet, still, with your straw hat Loaded with vines, and with your dear pale face, On which those thirty years so lightly sat, And the white outline of your muslin dress. You wore a little fichu trimmed with lace And crossed in front, as was the fashion then, Bound at your waist with a broad band or sash, All white and fresh and virginally plain. There was a sound of shouting far away Down in the valley, as they called to us, And you, with hands clasped seeming still to pray Patience of fate, stood listening to me thus With heaving bosom. There a rose lay curled. It was the reddest rose in all the world. XLVIII THE SAME CONTINUED I think there never was a dearer woman, A better, kinder, truer than you were, A gentler spirit more divinely human Than yours with your sweet melancholy air Of tender gaiety, which seemed like care, And in your voice a sob as of distress At the world's ways, its sin and its despair, Being yourself all strange to wickedness. Now you are neither gentle, kind, nor good, And you have sorrows of your own to grieve, And in your mirth compassion has no mood; You wear no more your heart upon your sleeve, And if your voice still sobs 'tis with a sense Of sorrow's power, grief's wealth, experience. XLIX THE SAME CONTINUED A “woman with a past.” What happier omen Could heart desire for mistress or for friend? Phœnix of friends, and most divine of women, Skilled in all fence to venture or defend And with love's science at your fingers' end, No tears to vex, no ignorance to bore, A fancy ripe, the zest which sorrows lend!— I would to God we had not met before! —I would to God! and yet to God I would That we had never met. To see you thus Is grief and wounds and poison to my blood. Oh, this is sacrilege and foul abuse. You were a thing for honour not vile use, Not for the mad world's wicked sinks and stews. L THE SAME CONTINUED What have I done? What gross impiety Prompted my hand thus against God and good? Was there not joy on Earth enough for me That I must scale the Heaven where you stood, And with my sinful blood pollute your blood? You were the type of wise sweet sanctity, Of that unearthly half of womanhood Which well redeems the rest. Oh, Juliet, we Sinned in a temple, and our tears to-day Appeal in vain to Heaven which dares not hear. God is not always mocked. And thus we pay Our uttermost debt unheeded, tear on tear And scoff on scoff and sin heaped up on sin, While there is justice on the Earth to men. LI THE SAME CONTINUED We planted love, and lo it bred a brood Of lusts and vanities and senseless joys. We planted love, and you have gathered food Of every bitter herb which fills and cloys. Your meat is loud excitement and mad noise, Your wine the unblest ambition of command O'er hearts of men, of dotards, idiots, boys. These are the playthings fitted to your hand, These are your happiness. You weep no more, But I must weep. My Heaven has been defiled. My sin has found me out and smites me sore, And folly, justified of her own child, Rules all the empire where love reigned of yore, Folly red-cheeked but rotten to the core. LII THE SAME CONTINUED Lame, impotent conclusion to youth's dreams Vast as all heaven! See, what glory lies Entangled here in these base stratagems, What virtue done to death! O glorious sighs, Sublime beseechings, high cajoleries, Fond wraths, brave ruptures, all that sometime was Our daily bread of gods beneath the skies, How are ye ended, in what utter loss! Time was, time is, and time is yet to come, Till even time itself shall have its end. These were eternal. And behold, a tomb! Come, let us laugh and eat and drink. God send What all the world must need one day as we, Speedy oblivion, rest for memory. LIII THE SAME CONTINUED Farewell, then. It is finished. I forgo With this all right in you, even that of tears. If I have spoken hardly, it will show How much I loved you. With you disappears A glory, a romance of many years. What you may be henceforth I will not know. The phantom of your presence on my fears Is impotent at length for weal or woe. Your past, your present, all alike must fade In a new land of dreams where love is not. Then kiss me and farewell. The choice is made And we shall live to see the past forgot, If not forgiven. See, I came to curse, Yet stay to bless. I know not which is worse. PART III.—GODS AND FALSE GODS LIV HE DESIRES THE IMPOSSIBLE If it were possible the fierce sun should, Standing in heaven unloved, companionless, Enshrinèd be in some white-bosomed cloud, And so forget his rage and loneliness; If it were possible the bitter seas Should suddenly grow sweet, till at their brink Birds with bright eyes should stoop athirst and drink; —If these were possible; and if to these It should be proved that love has sometimes been 'Twixt lambs and leopards, doves and hawks, that snow Clasps the bare rocks, that rugged oaks grow green In the west wind, that pinkest blossoms blow Upon May's blackest thorn;—then, only then, I might believe that love between us two Was still in heaven's gift, sweet child.—And you? LV ST. VALENTINE'S DAY To-day, all day, I rode upon the Down, With hounds and horsemen, a brave company. On this side in its glory lay the sea, On that the Sussex Weald, a sea of brown. The wind was light, and brightly the sun shone, And still we galloped on from gorse to gorse. And once, when checked, a thrush sang, and my horse Pricked his quick ears as to a sound unknown. I knew the Spring was come. I knew it even Better than all by this, that through my chase In bush and stone and hill and sea and heaven I seemed to see and follow still your face. Your face my quarry was. For it I rode, My horse a thing of wings, myself a god. LVI TO ONE WHOM HE DARED NOT LOVE As one who, in a desert wandering Alone and faint beneath a pitiless sky, And doubting in his heart if he shall bring His bones back to his kindred or there die, Finds at his feet a treasure suddenly Such as would make him for all time a king, And so forgets his fears and with keen eye Falls to a-counting each new precious thing: —So was I when you told me yesterday The tale of your dear love. Awhile I stood Astonished and enraptured, and my heart Began to count its treasures. Now dismay Steals back my joy, and terror chills my blood, And I remember only “We must part.” LVII ON A LOST OPPORTUNITY We might, if you had willed, have conquered Heaven. Once only in our lives before the gate Of Paradise we stood, one fortunate even, And gazed in sudden rapture through the grate. And, while you stood astonished, I, our fate Venturing, pushed the latch and found it free. There stood the tree of knowledge fair and great Beside the tree of life. One instant we Stood in that happy garden, guardianless. My hands already turned towards the tree And in another moment we had known The taste of joy and immortality And been ourselves as gods. But in distress You thrust me back with supplicating arms And eyes of terror, till the impatient sun Had time to set and till the heavenly host Rushed forth on us with clarions and alarms And cast us out for ever, blind and lost. LVIII TO ONE ON HER WASTE OF TIME Why practise, love, this small economy Of your heart's favours? Can you keep a kiss To be enjoyed in age? And would the free Expense of pleasure leave you penniless? Nay, nay. Be wise. Believe me, pleasure is A gambler's token, only gold to-day. The day of love is short, and every bliss Untasted now is a bliss thrown away. 'Twere pitiful, in truth, such treasures should Lie by like miser's crusts till mouldy grown. Think you the hand of age will be less rude In touching your sweet bosom than my own? Alas, what matter, when our heads are grey, Whether you loved or did not love to-day? LIX THE HAUNTED HOUSE How loud the storm blew all that bitter night! The loosened ivy tapping on the pane Woke me and woke, again and yet again, Till I was full awake and sat upright. I listened to the noises of the night, And presently I heard, disguised yet plain, A footstep on the stair which mounted light Towards me, and my heart outbeat the rain. I knew that it was you. I knew it even Before the door, which by design ajar Waited your coming, had disclosed my fate. I felt a wind upon my face from heaven. I felt the presence of a life. My hair Was touched as by a spirit. Insensate I drew you to my bosom. Ah, too late! I clutched the darkness. There was nothing there. LX THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE Ah Love, dear Love. In vain I scoff. In vain I ply my barren wit, and jest at thee. Thou heedest not, or dost forgive the pain, And in thy own good time and thy own way, Waiting my silence, thou dost vanquish me. Thou comest at thy will in sun or rain And at the hour appointed, a Spring day, An Autumn night—and lo, I serve again. Forgive me, touch me, chide me. What to thee, God that thou art, are these vain shifts of mine? Let me but know thee. Thou alone art wise. I ask not to be wise or great or free Or aught but at thy knees and wholly thine, Thus, and to feel thy hand upon mine eyes. LXI TO ONE EXCUSING HIS POVERTY Ah! love, impute it not to me a sin That my poor soul thus beggared comes to thee. My soul a pilgrim was, in search of thine, And met these accidents by land and sea. The world was hard, and took its usury, Its toll for each new night in each new inn; And every road had robber bands to fee; And all, even kindness, must be paid in coin. Behold my scrip is empty, my heart bare. I give thee nothing who my all would give. My pilgrimage is finished, and I fare Bare to my death, unless with thee I live. Ah! give, love, and forgive that I am poor. Ah! take me to thy arms and ask no more. LXII TO ONE WHO WOULD MAKE A CONFESSION Oh! leave the Past to bury its own dead. The Past is naught to us, the Present all. What need of last year's leaves to strew Love's bed? What need of ghosts to grace a festival? I would not, if I could, those days recall, Those days not ours. For us the feast is spread, The lamps are lit, and music plays withal. Then let us love and leave the rest unsaid. This island is our home. Around it roar Great gulfs and oceans, channels, straits, and seas. What matter in what wreck we reached the shore, So we both reached it? We can mock at these. Oh! leave the Past, if Past indeed there be. I would not know it. I would know but thee. LXIII THE PLEASURES OF LOVE I do not care for kisses. 'Tis a debt We paid for the first privilege of love. These are the rains of April which have wet Our fallow hearts and forced their germs to move. Now the green corn has sprouted. Each new day Brings better pleasures, a more dear surprise, The blade, the ear, the harvest—and our way Leads through a region wealthy grown and wise. We now compare our fortunes. Each his store Displays to kindred eyes of garnered grain, Two happy farmers, learned in love's lore, Who weigh and touch and argue and complain. Dear endless argument! Yet sometimes we Even as we argue kiss. There! Let it be. LXIV HE APPEALS AGAINST HIS BOND In my distress Love made me sign a bond, A cruel bond. 'Twas by necessity Wrung from a foolish heart, alas, too fond, Too blindly fond, its error to foresee. And now my soul's estate, in jeopardy, Lies to a pledge it never can redeem. Love's loan was love, one hour of ecstasy, His penalty eternal loss of him. —See, I am penniless, the forfeit paid, And go a beggar forth from thy dear sight, My pound of more than flesh too strictly weighed And cut too near the heart. Fair Israelite, Thy plea was just. Thy right has been confessed. And yet a work of mercy were twice blessed. LXV TO ONE WHO SPOKE ILL OF HIM What is your quarrel with me, in love's name, Fair queen of wrath? What evil have I done, What treason to the thought of our dear shame Subscribed or plotted? Is my heart less one In its obedience to your stern decrees Than on the day when first you said “I please,” And with your lips ordained our union? Am I not now, as then, upon my knees? You bade me love you, and the deed was done, And when you cried “Enough” I stopped, and when You bade me go I went, and when you said “Forget me” I forgot. Alas, what wrong Would you avenge upon a loyal head, Which ever bowed to you in joy and pain, That you thus scourge me with your pitiless tongue? LXVI THE THREE AGES OF WOMAN Love, in thy youth, a stranger, knelt to thee, With cheeks all red and golden locks all curled, And cried, “Sweet child, if thou wilt worship me, Thou shalt possess the kingdoms of the world.” But you looked down and said, “I know you not, Nor want I other kingdom than my soul.” Till Love in shame, convicted of his plot, Left you and turned him to some other goal. And this discomfiture which you had seen Long served you for your homily and boast, While, of your beauty and yourself the queen, You lived a monument of vain love crossed, With scarce a thought of that which might have been To scare you with the ghost of pleasures lost. LXVII THE SAME CONTINUED Your youth flowed on, a river chaste and fair, Till thirty years were written to your name. A wife, a mother, these the titles were Which conquered for you the world's fairest fame. In all things you were wise but in this one, That of your wisdom you yourself did doubt. Youth spent like age, no joy beneath the sun. Your glass of beauty vainly running out. Then suddenly again, ere well you knew, Love looked upon you tenderly, yet sad: “Are these wise follies, then, enough for you?” He said;—“Love's wisdom were itself less mad.” And you: “What wouldst thou of me?” “My bare due, In token of what joys may yet be had.” LXVIII THE SAME CONTINUED Again Love left you. With appealing eyes You watched him go, and lips apart to speak. He left you, and once more the sun did rise And the sun set, and week trod close on week And month on month, till you had reached the goal Of forty years, and life's full waters grew To bitterness and flooded all your soul, Making you loathe old things and pine for new. And you into the wilderness had fled, And in your desolation loud did cry, “Oh for a hand to turn these stones to bread!” Then in your ear Love whispered scornfully, “Thou too, poor fool, thou, even thou,” he said, “Shalt taste thy little honey ere thou die.” LXIX SIBYLLINE BOOKS When first, a boy, at your fair knees I kneeled, 'Twas with a worthy offering. In my hand My young life's book I held, a volume sealed, Which none but you, I deemed, might understand. And you I did entreat to loose the band And read therein your own soul's destiny. But, Tarquin-like, you turned from my demand, Too proudly fair to find your fate in me. When now I come, alas, what hands have turned Those virgin pages! Some are torn away, And some defaced, and some with passion burned, And some besmeared with life's least holy clay. Say, shall I offer you these pages wet With blood and tears? And will your sorrow read What your joy heeded not?—Unopened yet One page remains. It still may hold a fate, A counsel for the day of utter need. Nay, speak, sad heart, speak quick. The hour is late. Age threatens us. The Gaul is at the gate. LXX ON READING THE MEMOIRS OF M. D'ARTAGNAN Why was I born in this degenerate age? Or rather why, a thousand times, with soul Of such degenerate stuff that a mute rage Is all its reason, tears the only toll It takes on life, and impotence its goal? Why was I born to this sad heritage Of fierce desires which cannot fate control, Of idle hopes life never can assuage? Why was I born thus weak?—Oh to have been A merry fool, at jest with destiny; A free hand ready and a heart as free; A ruffler in the camps of Mazarin! Oh for the honest soul of d'Artagnan, Twice happy knave, a Gascon and a man! LXXI THE TWO HIGHWAYMEN I long have had a quarrel set with Time, Because he robbed me. Every day of life Was wrested from me after bitter strife, I never yet could see the sun go down But I was angry in my heart, nor hear The leaves fall in the wind without a tear Over the dying summer. I have known No truce with Time nor, Time's accomplice, Death. The fair world is the witness of a crime Repeated every hour. For life and breath Are sweet to all who live; and bitterly The voices of these robbers of the heath Sound in each ear and chill the passer by. —What have we done to thee, thou monstrous Time? What have we done to Death that we must die? LXXII FROM THE FRENCH OF ANVERS My heart has its secret, my soul its mystery, A love which is eternal begotten in a day. The ill is long past healing. Why should I speak to-day? For none have ears to hear, and, least of all, she. Alas I shall have lived unseen tho' ever near, For ever at her side, for ever too alone. I shall have lived my life unknowing and unknown, Asking naught, daring naught, receiving naught from her. And she, whom Heaven made kind and chaste and fair, Shall go undoubting on, the while upon her way The murmur of my love shall fill the land, Till, reading here perchance severe and unaware These lines so full of her, she shall look up and say “Who was this woman then?” and shall not understand. LXXIII TO ONE TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN UNJUST If I was angry once that you refused The bread I asked and offered me a stone, Deeming the rights of bounty thus abused And my poor beggary but trampled on, Believe me now I would that wrong atone With such submission as a heart can show, Asking no bread of life but that alone Your dear heart proffered and my pride let go. Give me your help, your pity, what you will, Your pardon for a sin, your act of grace For a rebellion vanquished and undone, The stone I once refused, that precious stone Your friendship, so my thoughts may serve you still Even if I never more behold your face. LXXIV THE MOCKERY OF LIFE God! What a mockery is this life of ours! Cast forth in blood and pain from our mother's womb, Most like an excrement, and weeping showers Of senseless tears: unreasoning, naked, dumb, The symbol of all weakness and the sum: Our very life a sufferance.—Presently, Grown stronger, we must fight for standing-room Upon the earth, and the bare liberty To breathe and move. We crave the right to toil. We push, we strive, we jostle with the rest. We learn new courage, stifle our old fears, Stand with stiff backs, take part in every broil. It may be that we love, that we are blest. It may be, for a little space of years, We conquer fate and half forget our tears. LXXV THE SAME CONTINUED And then fate strikes us. First our joys decay. Youth, with its pleasures, is a tale soon told. We grow a little poorer day by day. Old friendships falter. Loves grow strangely cold. In vain we shift our hearts to a new hold And barter joy for joy, the less for less. We doubt our strength, our wisdom, and our gold. We stand alone, as in a wilderness Of doubts and terrors. Then, if we be wise, We make our terms with fate and, while we may, Sell our life's last sad remnant for a hope. And it is wisdom thus to close our eyes. But for the foolish, those who cannot pray, What else remains of their dark horoscope But a tall tree and courage and a rope? LXXVI THE SAME CONTINUED And who shall tell what ignominy death Has yet in store for us; what abject fears Even for the best of us; what fights for breath; What sobs, what supplications, what wild tears; What impotence of soul against despairs Which blot out reason?—The last trembling thought Of each poor brain, as dissolution nears, Is not of fair life lost, of Heaven bought And glory won. 'Tis not the thought of grief; Of friends deserted; loving hearts which bleed; Wives, sisters, children who around us weep. But only a mad clutching for relief From physical pain, importunate Nature's need; The search as for a womb where we may creep Back from the world, to hide,—perhaps to sleep. LXXVII WHO WOULD LIVE AGAIN? Oh who would live again to suffer loss? Once in my youth I battled with my fate, Grudging my days to death. I would have won A place by violence beneath the sun. I took my pleasures madly as by force, Even the air of heaven was a prize. I stood a plunderer at death's very gate, And all the lands of life I did o'errun With sack and pillage. Then I scorned to die, Save as a conqueror. The treasuries Of love I ransacked; pity, pride and hate. All that can make hearts beat or brim men's eyes With living tears I took as robes to wear. —But see, now time has struck me on the hip. I cannot hate nor love. My senses are Struck silent with the silence of my lip. No courage kindles in my heart to dare, No strength to do. The world's last phantoms slip Out of my grasp, and naught is left but pain. Love, life, vain strength!—Oh who would live again? LXXVIII COLD COMFORT There is no comfort underneath the sun. Youth turns to age; riches are quickly spent; Pride breeds us pain, our pleasures punishment. The very courage which we count upon A single night of fever shall break down, And love is slain by fear. Death last of all Spreads out his nets and watches for our fall. There is no comfort underneath the sun! —When thou art old, O man, if thou wert proud Be humble; pride will here avail thee not. There is no courage which can conquer death. Forget that thou wert wise. Nay, keep thy breath For prayer, that so thy wisdom be forgot And thou perhaps get pity of thy God. LXXIX AMOUR OBLIGE I could forgive you, dearest, all the folly Your heart has dreamed. Alas, as we grow old, We need more vigorous cures for melancholy, A stronger nutriment for hearts grown cold. We need in face of weakness to be bold. We need our folly to keep fate at bay. Oh, we need madness in the manifold Doubts and despairs which herald our decay. I could forgive you all and more than all. Yet, dearest, though for us fate waves his hand And we accept it as the common lot To meet no more at this life's festival, It were unseemly you should take your stand, Now my heart's citadel is laid in siege, In open field with those who love me not. Love has a rank which surely should oblige. LXXX TO ONE UNFORGOTTEN You are not false perhaps, as lovers say Meaning the act,—Alas, that guilt was mine. Nor, maybe, have you bowed at other shrine Than the true god's where first you learned to pray. I know the idols round you. They are clay, Mere Dagons to the courage half divine Which bears you scathless still thro' sap and mine And breach and storm upon your virgin way. Alas, I know your virtue. But your heart, How have you treated it? I sometimes see, When nights are long, a vision chaste and true Of pale pathetic eyes which gaze on me In love and grief eternal. Then I start, Crying aloud, and reach my arms to you. LXXXI TO ONE WHOM HE HAD LOVED TOO LONG Why do I cling to thee, sad love? Too long Thou bringest me neither pleasure to my soul Nor profit to my reason save in song, My daily utterance. See, thy beggar's dole Of foolish tears cannot my tears cajole; Thy laughter doth my laughter grievous wrong; Thy anger angereth me; thou heapest coal Of fire upon my head the drear night long With thy forgiveness. What is this thou wilt? Mine ears have ceased to hear, my tongue to speak, And naught is left for my spent heart to do. Love long has left the feast; the cup is spilt. Let us go too. The dawn begins to break, And there is mockery in this heaven of blue. LXXXII HE WOULD LEAD A BETTER LIFE I am tired of folly, tired of my own ways, Love is a strife. I do not want to strive. If I had foes I now would make my peace. If I less wedded were I now would wive. I would do service to my kind, contrive Something of good for men, some happiness For those who in the world still love and live, And, as my fathers did, so end my days. I would earn praise, I too, of honest men. I would repent in sackcloth if needs be. I would serve God and expiate my sin, Abjuring love and thee—ay, even thee. I would do this, dear love. But what am I To will or do? As we have lived we die. PART IV.—VITA NOVA LXXXIII A DAY IN SUSSEX The dove did lend me wings. I fled away From the loud world which long had troubled me. Oh lightly did I flee when hoyden May Threw her wild mantle on the hawthorn tree. I left the dusty high road, and my way Was through deep meadows, shut with copses fair. A choir of thrushes poured its roundelay From every hedge and every thicket there. Mild, moon-faced kine looked on, where in the grass All heaped with flowers I lay, from noon till eve. And hares unwitting close to me did pass, And still the birds sang, and I could not grieve. Oh what a blessed thing that evening was! Peace, music, twilight, all that could deceive A soul to joy or lull a heart to peace. It glimmers yet across whole years like these. LXXXIV IN ANNIVERSARIO MORTIS If I can bring no tribute of fresh tears To mingle with the dust which covers thee; If in this latest dawn of evil years My rebel eyes withhold their sympathy; If of a truth my thoughts so barren be Of their old griefs, so numb to tenderness That they nor hear nor taste nor feel nor see The sweetness of thy presence in this place; If I now drowse,—'tis that the flesh is weak More than the spirit. See, by thy dear bed Once more I kneel in sorrow and in love. See, I still watch by thee if thou shouldst move, If thou shouldst raise thy hand or turn thy head, Or speak my name. And yet thou dost not speak. LXXXV THE SAME CONTINUED These flowers shall be my offering, living flowers Which here shall die with you in sacrifice, Flowers from the empty fields which once were yours And now are mine. No gold, nor myrrh, nor spice, Nor any dead man's offering may suffice. I love not flowers: but thus to deck a grave Which has no need of things of greater price. Life is the only tribute death would have. —Ah, thou art dead. Mine is this fair domain With all its living beauty and brave shows Of lawn, and lake, and garden; mine the increase Of the year's harvest, the slow growth of trees, And that fair natural wealth we loved in vain, Flowers, which shall never more adorn my house. LXXXVI THE SAME CONTINUED It is not true the dead unhonoured were If they returned to life. Nay, claim thine own, And see how gladly I, thy “thankless heir,” Will yield thee back possession of thy throne. I am not so in love with riches grown That such can comfort me. Alas, too long The fields are furrowed and the wheat is sown For my sole grief that these should do thee wrong. I hold these things not wholly as in fee, But thinking that perhaps some happy day We yet may walk together, and devise Of the old lands we loved, in Paradise, And I shall give account, as best I may, How I thy tenant was awhile for thee. LXXXVII THE SAME CONTINUED Thy ways were not my ways. Thy life was peace, And mine has been a battle. Thou didst store Thy soul's wealth sternly to a sure increase, And thy revenue's much still swelled to more. Thou squanderedst nothing on the pomp of war, The lust of glory. No mad covetous eyes Were thine upon thy neighbour's lands afar, His wealth, his wife, his fenceless vanities. Thou wert a brave, just man, whom all men knew And trusted, and some loved, and thou to me Wert as a tower of strength, a sanctuary To which I fled from the world's maddened crew, Wounded by me, and there with bloodstained hands Clung to the altar of thy innocence. LXXXVIII THE SAME CONTINUED There were two with thee in thine agony, I and another. In that hour supreme We stood beside thy cross and gazed at thee, Waiting till death should wake thee from thy dream. Thy hands held both our hands and clung to them And drew them to each other. We could see Thy dumb lips open as to either name And thy eyes turn to our eyes wistfully. O eloquent eyes! Ye were not closed in vain. Still from the grave ye speak, “Behold a son, Behold a mother.” From that rite of pain We two went home together bone of bone And flesh of flesh, distinguished among men, Thy witnesses till death shall come again. LXXXIX THE LIMIT OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE There is a vice in the world's reasoning. Man Has conquered knowledge. He has conquered power; He has traced out the universal plan Of the Earth's being; and in this last hour He has unmade the God which he had made. I cannot doubt but he at length has read The riddle of the Earth; that he is wise. He also hath dominion charterèd Over the lands, the oceans, and the skies, Which toil and sweat to give him daily bread. —Knowledge he hath, and power upon the Earth, And long ago he had himself been God, But for the cruel secret of his birth, Which gave him kindred with the dust he trod, And for the hideous ending of his mirth, A fly-blown carrion festering 'neath the sod. XC THE PRIDE OF UNBELIEF When I complained that I had lost my hope Of life eternal with the eternal God; When I refused to read my horoscope In the unchanging stars, or claim abode With powers and dominations, but, poor clod, Clung to the earth and grovelled in my tears, Because I soon must lie beneath the sod And close the little number of my years,— Then I was told that pride had barred the way, And raised this foul rebellion in my head. Yet, strange rebellion! I, but yesterday, Was God's own son in His own likeness bred. And thrice strange pride! who thus am cast away And go forth lost and disinherited. XCI LAUGHTER AND DEATH There is no laughter in the natural world Of beast or fish or bird, though no sad doubt Of their futurity to them unfurled Has dared to check the mirth-compelling shout. The lion roars his solemn thunder out To the sleeping woods. The eagle screams her cry. Even the lark must strain a serious throat To hurl his blest defiance at the sky. Fear, anger, jealousy have found a voice. Love's pain or rapture the brute bosoms swell. Nature has symbols for her nobler joys, Her nobler sorrows. Who had dared foretell That only man, by some sad mockery, Should learn to laugh who learns that he must die? XCII WRITTEN IN DISTRESS We sometimes sit in darkness. I long while Have sat there, in a shadow as of death. My friends and comforters no longer smile, And they who grudge me wrongfully my breath Are strong and many. I am bowed beneath A weight of trouble and unjust reproach From many fools and friends of little faith. The world is little worth, yet troubles much. But I am comforted in this, that I, Although my face is darkened to men's eyes And all my life eclipsed with angry wars, Now see things hidden; and I seem to spy New worlds above my heaven. Night is wise And joy a sun which never guessed the stars. XCIII A DISAPPOINTMENT Spring, of a sudden, came to life one day. Ere this, the Winter had been cold and chill. That morning first the Summer air did fill The world, making bleak March seem almost May. The daffodils were blooming golden gay; The birch trees budded purple on the hill; The rose, that clambered up the window-sill, Put forth a crimson shoot. All yesterday The winds about the casement chilly blew, But now the breeze that played before the door So caught the dead leaves that I thought there flew Brown butterflies up from the grassy floor. —But someone said you came not. Ah, too true! And I, I thought that Winter reigned once more. XCIV A YEAR AGO A year ago I too was proud of May, I too delighted in the blackbird's song. When the sun shone my soul made holiday. When the rain fell I felt it as a wrong. Then for me too the world was fresh and young. Oh what a miracle each bluebell was! How my heart leaped in union with my tongue, When first I lit upon a stag's horn moss! —A year ago! Alas, one Summer's fire, One autumn's chill, one Winter's discontent, And now one Spring of joy and hope deferred Have brought me to this pass of undesire That I behold May's veil of beauty rent And stand unmoved by sun and flower and bird. XCV HE IS NOT A POET I would not, if I could, be called a poet. I have no natural love of the “chaste muse.” If aught be worth the doing I would do it; And others, if they will, may tell the news. I care not for their laurels but would choose On the world's field to fight or fall or run. My soul's ambition will not take excuse To play the dial rather than the sun. The faith I held I hold, as when a boy I left my books for cricket-bat and gun. The tales of poets are but scholars' themes. In my hot youth I held it that a man With heart to dare and stomach to enjoy Had better work to his hand in any plan Of any folly, so the thing were done, Than in the noblest dreaming of mere dreams. XCVI ON THE SHORTNESS OF TIME If I could live without the thought of death, Forgetful of time's waste, the soul's decay, I would not ask for other joy than breath With light and sound of birds and the sun's ray. I could sit on untroubled day by day Watching the grass grow, and the wild flowers range From blue to yellow and from red to grey In natural sequence as the seasons change. I could afford to wait, but for the hurt Of this dull tick of time which chides my ear. But now I dare not sit with loins ungirt And staff unlifted, for death stands too near. I must be up and doing—ay, each minute. The grave gives time for rest when we are in it. XCVII CHANCLEBURY RING Say what you will, there is not in the world A nobler sight than from this upper Down. No rugged landscape here, no beauty hurled From its Creator's hand as with a frown; But a green plain on which green hills look down Trim as a garden plot. No other hue Can hence be seen, save here and there the brown Of a square fallow, and the horizon's blue. Dear checker-work of woods, the Sussex Weald! If a name thrills me yet of things of earth, That name is thine. How often I have fled To thy deep hedgerows and embraced each field, Each lag, each pasture,—fields which gave me birth And saw my youth, and which must hold me dead. XCVIII SONNET IN ASSONANCE A thousand bluebells blossom in the wood, Shut in a tangled brake of briar roses, And guarded well from every wanton foot, A treasure by no eye of man beholden, No eye but mine. No other tongue hath spoken Out to the joyless world what hidden joys Lie there untasted, mines of wealth unnoted, While a starved world without lives blank and void. —Ah, couldst thou know, poor wretch, what I have known, See what I saw upon that bank enshrinèd, Soft pity had not wholly left thy soul And tears had dimmed thy hard eyes uninvited. Eyes that are cruel-bright with hunger's brightness, Hunger for beauty, solitude, and peace. There hadst thou found a beauty and a silence, Such as nor tongue can tell nor fancy dream. XCIX YOUTH Youth, ageless youth, the old gods' attribute! —To inherit cheeks a-tingle with such blood As wood nymphs blushed, who to the first-blown flute Went out in endless dancing through the wood. To live, and taste of that immortal food After the wild day's waste prepared for us By deathless hands, and straightway be renewed, Like the god's entrails upon Caucasus. To rise at dawn with eye and brain and sense Clear as the pale green edge where dawn began, While each bold thought full shapen should arise, Cutting the horizon of experience, Sharp as an obelisk.—Ah, wretched Man! 'Tis little wonder that the gods are wise. C AGE O Age, thou art the very thief of joy, For thou hast rifled many a proud fool Of all his passions, hoarded by a rule Of stern economy. Him, yet a boy, Harsh wisdom governed. Others turned to toy With lusty passion. He was chaste and cool As a young Dorian in Lycurgus' school. Ah me, that thou such souls shouldst dare annoy. Thus did he gather him a store of pleasure, Nor cared to touch what he so hardly won, But led long years of solitary strife; And, when the rest should have consumed their treasure, He thought to sit him in the evening sun And taste the sweet fruits of a sober life. CI THE SAME CONTINUED But thou didst come upon him ere he wist, A silent highwayman, and take his all And leave him naked, when the night should fall And all the road was conjured in a mist. Too well thou keepedst thy unholy tryst, As long ago that eastern seneschal Rode all day long to meet at evenfall Him he had fled ere yet the sun uprist. —But I have spent me like a prodigal The treasure of my youth, and, long ago, Have eaten husks among the hungry swine, And when I meet thee I will straightway fall Upon thy neck, and if the tears shall flow, They shall be tears of love for thee and thine. CII THE VENUS OF MILO What art thou? Woman? Goddess? Aphrodite? Yet never such as thou from the cold foam Of ocean, nor from cloudy heaven might come, Who wast begotten on her bridal night In passionate Earth's womb by Man's delight, When Man was young. I cannot trace in thee Time's handiwork. Say, rather, where is he For whom thy face was red which is so white? Thou standest ravished, broken, and thy face Is writ with ancient passions. Thou art dumb To my new love. Yet, whatsoe'er of good, Of crime, of pride, of passion, or of grace In woman is, thou, woman, hast in sum. Earth's archetypal Eve. All Womanhood. CIII WRITTEN AT FLORENCE O world, in very truth thou art too young, When wilt thou learn to wear the garb of age? World, with thy covering of yellow flowers, Hast thou forgot what generations sprung Out of thy loins and loved thee and are gone? Hast thou no place in all their heritage Where thou dost only weep that I may come Nor fear the mockery of thy yellow flowers? O world, in very truth thou art too young. The heroic wealth of passionate emprize Built thee fair cities for thy naked plains. How hast thou set thy summer growth among The broken stones which were their palaces! Hast thou forgot the darkness where he lies Who made thee beautiful, or have thy bees Found out his grave to build their honeycombs? CIV THE SAME CONTINUED O world, in very truth thou art too young, They gave thee love who measured out thy skies, And, when they found for thee another star, Who made a festival and straightway hung The jewel on thy neck. O merry world, Hast thou forgot the glory of those eyes Which first looked love in thine? Thou hast not furled One banner of thy bridal car for them. O world, in very truth thou art too young. There was a voice which sang about thy Spring, Till Winter froze the sweetness of his lips, And lo, the worms had hardly left his tongue Before thy nightingales were come again. O world, what courage hast thou thus to sing? Say, has thy merriment no secret pain No sudden weariness that thou art young? CV PALAZZO PAGANI This is the house where, twenty years ago, They spent a Spring and Summer. This shut gate Would lead you to the terrace, and below To a rose garden long since desolate. Here they once lived. How often I have sat Till it was dusk among the olive trees, Waiting to hear their coming horse-hoofs grate Upon the gravel; till the freshening breeze Bore down a sound of voices. Even yet A broken echo of their laughter rings Through the deserted terraces; and see, While I am speaking, from the parapet There is a hand put forth, and some one flings Her very window open overhead. —How sweet it is, this scent of rosemary! —These are the last tears I shall ever shed. CVI THE SUBLIME To stand upon a windy pinnacle, Beneath the infinite blue of the blue noon, And underfoot a valley terrible As that dim gulf, where sense and being swoon When the soul parts; a giant valley strewn With giant rocks; asleep, and vast, and still, And far away. The torrent, which has hewn His pathway through the entrails of the hill, Now crawls along the bottom and anon Lifts up his voice, a muffled tremulous roar, Borne on the wind an instant, and then gone Back to the caverns of the middle air; A voice as of a nation overthrown With beat of drums, when hosts have marched to war. CVII THE SAME CONTINUED Clutching the brink with hands and feet and knees, With trembling heart, and eyes grown strangely dim, A part thyself and parcel of the frieze Of that colossal temple raised to Time, To gaze on horror, till, as in a crime, Thou and the rocks become accomplices. There is no voice, no life 'twixt thee and them. No life! Yet, look, far down upon the breeze Something has passed across the bosom bare Of the red rocks, a leaf, a shape, a shade. A living shadow! Ay, above thee there, Weaving majestic circles overhead, Others are watching.—This is the sublime To be alone, with eagles in the air. CVIII A FOREST IN BOSNIA Spirit of Trajan! What a world is here, What remnant of old Europe in this wood, Of life primæval rude as in the year When thy first legions by the Danube stood. These are the very Dacians they subdued, Swineherds and shepherds clad in skins of deer And fox and marten still, a bestial brood, Than their own swine begotten swinelier. The fair oak-forest, their first heritage, Pastures them still, and still the hollow oak Receives them in its bosom. Still o'erhead Upon the stag-head tops, grown hoar with age, Calm buzzards sit and ancient ravens croak, And all with solemn life is tenanted. CIX ROUMELI HISSAR The Empire of the East, grown dull to fear By long companionship with angry fate, In silent anguish saw her doom appear In this dark fortress built upon the strait, And Sultan Mahmoud standing at her gate, For she must perish. Hissar many a year Struck terror into all who gazed thereat, Till in his turn the Turk had learned to wear The purple and fine linen of the State, And fell in impotence. These walls to-day, With Judas tree and lilac overgrown, Move all men's hearts. For close on barbarous power Tread lust and indolence, and then decay, Till we forgive.—The very German boor, Who in his day of fortune moves our scorn, Purged of his slough, in after ages may Invite the tears of nations yet unborn. CX THE OASIS OF SIDI KHALED How the earth burns! Each pebble underfoot Is as a living thing with power to wound. The white sand quivers, and the footfall mute Of the slow camels strikes but gives no sound, As though they walked on flame, not solid ground. 'Tis noon, and the beasts' shadows even have fled Back to their feet, and there is fire around And fire beneath, and overhead the sun. Pitiful heaven! What is this we view? Tall trees, a river, pools, where swallows fly, Thickets of oleander where doves coo, Shades, deep as midnight, greenness for tired eyes. Hark, how the light winds in the palm-tops sigh. Oh this is rest. Oh this is paradise. CXI TO THE BEDOUIN ARABS Children of Shem! Firstborn of Noah's race, But still forever children; at the door Of Eden found, unconscious of disgrace, And loitering on while all are gone before; Too proud to dig; too careless to be poor; Taking the gifts of God in thanklessness, Not rendering aught, nor supplicating more, Nor arguing with Him when He hides His face. Yours is the rain and sunshine, and the way Of an old wisdom by our world forgot, The courage of a day which knew not death. Well may we sons of Japhet in dismay Pause in our vain mad fight for life and breath, Beholding you. I bow and reason not. CXII GIBRALTAR Seven weeks of sea, and twice seven days of storm Upon the huge Atlantic, and once more We ride into still water and the calm Of a sweet evening screened by either shore Of Spain and Barbary. Our toils are o'er, Our exile is accomplished. Once again We look on Europe, mistress as of yore Of the fair Earth and of the hearts of men. Ay, this is the famed rock, which Hercules And Goth and Moor bequeathed us. At this door England stands sentry. God! to hear the shrill Sweet treble of her fifes upon the breeze And at the summons of the rock gun's roar To see her red coats marching from the hill. CXIII TO ONE WITH HIS SONNETS This is the book. For evil and for good, What my life was in it is written plain. These are no dreams, but things of flesh and blood, The past that lived and shall not live again. This is the book. I dare not bid you read. Too much of my poor soul you would unlock. Your own soul, if it tender were, might bleed. I could not bear that you should only mock. My life lies here. And yet in vain, dear heart, The tale is told. One page it yearns to see, One play where one best actor should find part. But that, alas for love! shall never be. Yet, if a sign you seek between these lines, One hidden lies for you, a sign of signs. CXIV A LATER DEDICATION 1892 To her the sweetest, fairest, worthiest one, Who the inspirer is of my new praise, Whom lately once, one Autumn afternoon, I walked with nor told aught a lover says, And yet who knows I love her in all ways A maiden dreams: the suppliant at her throne, The counsellor of strength, the lord of lays Loyal to chastity and her alone, These rhymes I dedicate. Oh, if there be Still in this world of vanished creeds and kings Some faith in royal blood and right divine, Some lingering reverence paid to majesty, Here seek it and here find it, for it clings To each hushed verse like incense to a shrine. THE LOVE LYRICS OF PROTEUS SONG.—LOVE ME A LITTLE Love me a little, love me as thou wilt, Whether a draught it be of passionate wine Poured with both hands divine, Or just a cup of water spilt On dying lips and mine. Give me the love thou wilt, The purity, the guilt, So it be thine. Love me a little. Let it be thy cheek With its red signals. That were dear to kiss. Or, if thou mayest not this, A finger-tip my own to seek At nightfall when none guess. Eyes have the wit to speak, And sighs send messages: Even give less. Love me a little. Let it be in words Of happy omen heralding thy choice, Or in a veiled sad voice Of warning, like a frightened bird's. How should I not rejoice, Though swords be crossed with swords And discord mar love's chords And tears thy voice? Love me a little. All my world thou art. Thy much were Heaven: thy little Earth shall be. If not Eternity, Then Time be mine, the human part, A single hour with thee. Love as thou wilt and art, With all or half a heart, So thou love me. SONG.—OH FOR A DAY OF SPRING Oh for a day of Spring, A day of flowers and folly, Of birds that pipe and sing And boyhood's melancholy! I would not grudge the laughter, The tears that followed after. Oh for a day of youth, A day of strength and passion, Of words that told the truth And deeds the truth would fashion! I would not leave untasted One glory while it lasted. Oh for a day of days, A day with you and pleasure, Of love in all its ways And life in all its measure! Win me that day from sorrow, And let me die to-morrow. TWENTY DAYS Twenty days are barely gone, I was merry all the day. Folly was my butt of scorn. Now the fool myself I play. Wit and learning ruled my head, Logic and economy. All the books I ever read Taught me only vanity. Most of all it moved my mirth Womankind the world should rule. Man, the lord of all the Earth! He, forsooth, a woman's tool! Cherry lip and glancing eye! What were rosy cheeks to me? Beauty's truth was but a lie— Witness tomes of history! Twenty days had barely run. Twenty years they well might be. All my wisdom was undone, Reason bade good-night to me. Her hair was of the red red gold, Her blue eyes looked me through and through. She was twenty-three years old, I was twenty years and two. Fortune, fame, I freely give, Honour's self, if so she please, Sweetly in her smile to live Other twenty days like these. LOVE'S LIKENINGS He. To what, love, shall I liken thee? Thou, methinks, shalt firstly be A blue flower with nodding bells In the hollow of a tree. When the wind blows wantonly, Thou shalt ever shake thy head At the idle tale he tells. But at evening from the clover, When the world is all abed, And the noisy day is over, And the birds have gone to rest, In the darkness will I hover Till thou bid me come to thee, Till I creep into thy nest, I thy long-expected lover, I thy sweet, thy honey bee. To what, love, shall I liken thee? Tell me, love, what wouldst thou be? She. I would be a white cloud lying In the bosom of the sky, And at noon, when Earth is sighing For the sun my fleeces hide, I would bask in his bright eye, Till he drew me up on high, Till be took me for his bride. Thou shalt be my sun to me. Love, but I would be a well In the sands of Araby, So thyself wert a gazelle Which must either drink or die. Bend above me, love, and lo! In my waters thou shalt spy All that my heart cares to show, Thy own face against the sky. He. To what more shall I liken thee? Thou, my love, shalt lastly be A clear silver-tonguèd brook Running downwards to the Sea, And the reeds shall seek to stay thee Under every shaded nook, And the pebbles shall waylay thee, With their bald heads to dismay thee, Till thy pretty face grows white, Half in anger, half in fright. See, thy troubles are forgot In the still pool suddenly, And a smile has found thee out, Taking shape of thy delight, Laughing, weeping, onward ever Till thou join thyself to me, For my love shall be the river. Thou and I shall run together Ever till we meet the Sea. SONG.—RED, RED GOLD Red, red gold, a kingdom's ransom, child, To weave thy yellow hair she bade them spin. At early dawn the gossamer spiders toiled, And wove the sunrise in. She took the treasures of the deep blue noon, She took the clear eyes of the morning star, The pale-faced lilies of a seven-days moon, The dust of Phœbus' car. She painted thee with dewdrops from the flowers, Stained with their petals, hyacinth and rose, And violets all wet with April showers And snowdrops from the snows. A RHAPSODY There is a God most surely in the heavens, Who smileth always, though His face be hid. And young Joy cometh as His messenger Upon the Earth, like to a rushing wind, Scattering the dead leaves of our discontent Ere yet we see him. Then he setteth us Upon his back and flieth to God's presence, Till on our faces there is seen the light Which streameth from His brows for evermore. There is a God. Ay, by this breath of dawn, I swear there is a God, even here on Earth. And see, a blush upon the edge of heaven, Bearing me witness! There is something changed About these woods since yesterday; a look Of shame on Nature's face; a consciousness In the bent flowers; a troubled tell-tale gleam On the lake's brim. This morning, as I passed Over the lawn, there was an instant's hush Among the trees, and then a whispering Which woke the birds; and of a sudden, lo! A thousand voices breathed conspiracy; And now a silence. There are listening ears In all these bushes waiting till I speak. There is a God. I swear it on the truth Of my new joy, which is not of the Earth, But grows within my hand, a thing of strength, A wonder to the Earth, whose old worn heart Has long been joyless. Listen, while I speak, Ye autumn woods. Ye ancient forest trees, Lend me your ears. Thou little brook, be still Till I have spoken, for I have a tale For the morning's ear; and O! thou Nature's voice, Be silent this one day and hear of joy Newer than thine. You friends whom I have loved, Listen, and stop me not with word or sign Till I have poured my heart into your ears, For if you spoke to me I should not hear, And if you wept with me I should not see, And if you mocked me I should not suspect, Being this day the fool of happiness. And all my blood is full of dancing motes; And in my brain are chords of silver tone Divinely struck to statelier harmonies Than Heaven's own harping; and my eyes have tears Which brim and quiver, but they will not fall, For they are far too happy in my eyes. Tears,—what of tears? which are but new delights, New visions of new joys which none have seen, And which are mine. Such only Solomon Saw when he sat upon his ivory throne, And lo! the pageantry of Sheba came, Bearing its queen upon a sandal bed, And laid her at his feet. These even I, Who live and speak with you, have seen to-night. And mark, how simply wonders come about And take our hearts by storm, as in the night Fate creeps upon a city. I had fled Four months ago, when July nights were young, Out to the wilderness to be alone. Four months, four summer months among the hills, So far from my old life I had forgot All to my name. None knew me but my dog, And he was secret. Thus, in pedlar's guise, With pack and staff, and bartering such small wares Of pills and ointments as the vulgar love, And gathering simples, I had worked my way Through every valley of the Candriote hills. Four summer months of silence, and the balm Of the green pastures where the cattle go In the long droughts; among the giant rocks Which are the walls of heaven, the ibex' home; Among the dells where the green lizards lurk, Waiting for sunrise. Oh, I knew them all, The speckled birds which live among the stones. I made new friendship with each grass and weed, Each moss and lichen. Every flower became Like a familiar face, and as I passed The harebell nodded to me from her stem, The gentian opened wide her sapphire eyes, And the Alp-roses blushed. But, most of all, The butterflies were mine. I marked each one, As he came sailing down upon the wind, A furlong off. The Argus looked at me Out of his hundred eyes and did not move. I could have counted you the purple spots On great Apollo's wings. The shepherds came, And brought their sick, that I might heal their woes With my poor knowledge, and I learned in turn Much weather-wisdom, and some wisdom too Fresh from their human hearts 'twas wealth to know. And thus I lived and dreamed and drank the wind Which snows had cooled; and often I have stood On some tall pinnacle above the plain, And watched the clouds come flying on the breeze To tear their fleeces on the jagged rocks, Until they caught and folded me about In their damp garments; and, when these were gone, And the sun broke through the rain, my very soul Laughed with the sun, washed white as a christened child, And all was clean forgotten but its joy. Such life was mine the short sweet summer through; But when the August days were fled away And nights grew chill, I came to Bannastal On the Uranian sea, and there my fate Was waiting for me, though I knew it not. My fate, and what a fate! Oh, Lytton, now I see my life transfigured like a seer's. My eyes are open. I read plain the meaning Of all that I beheld and heard and knew Through the past summer, as in words of fire: The sadness of my soul, my pilgrimage Among the hills, each flower upon my way, The sun, the stars, the passionate face of heaven, The virtue of the earth, which expectation Peopled for me with signs and prophecies, All, all foretold the coming of a god. Nay more, each hope, each fancy, each desire, Each separate thought which I have thought, each sorrow Laid on my heart, each unseen accident Met in my road, each word, each look, each choice, Each idle dream that I have dreamt in folly, From my first hour till now, I do acknowledge As the great forecast of a glorious fate, Of hope made ecstasy and life made love. And thus it is I learned the very truth That God is on this earth. For twenty days Are come and gone, and twenty nights have been More sunny than those days, since these things were; And I still ride upon the back of joy, Which bears me bravely. Still the flowers blow. St. Martin's summer has brought back the birds To sing in these old gardens as in June. —Listen. I hear one like the nightingale, But sweeter and less sad, and thus she sings: SONG.—OH FLY NOT, PLEASURE Oh fly not, Pleasure, pleasant-hearted Pleasure. Fold me thy wings, I prithee, yet and stay. For my heart no measure Knows nor other treasure To buy a garland for my love to-day. And thou too, Sorrow, tender-hearted Sorrow. Thou grey-eyed mourner, fly not yet away. For I fain would borrow Thy sad weeds to-morrow To make a mourning for love's yesterday. The voice of Pity, Time's divine dear Pity, Moved me to tears. I dared not say them nay, But went forth from the city Making thus my ditty Of fair love lost for ever and a day. SONG.—WHY DO I LOVE? Why do I love? Is it for men to choose The hour of the hushed night when crowned with dews From its sea grave the morning star shall wake? Lo, while we drowsed, it rose on our heart's ache, And all our heaven was red with the day's hues, And glad birds chaunted from the trees above. So was it with my heart that might not choose But woke to love. Why do I love? The aureole of lost days Is on thy brow and unforgotten face; Faith's guiding light, the same which of old time Sent men on knightly quests to deeds sublime And the high prize which was their lady's grace. Thither I follow, careless what shall prove, So only at thy knees a little space I too may love. Why do I love? The paths of life are steep, And dark the issues and the gulfs how deep! This wayside shrine invites my knees to kneel. Thou, dearest Saint, in witness of my zeal Biddest me walk in joy who only weep, And fare forth comforted who vainly strove. See how my steps in thy sweet service leap! See how I love! Why do I love? There is a dream that stirs My soul to its last depth of lost desires, Music of waters in a thirsty land, A step, a touch, the lingering of a hand, Fingers that are the soft Spring's messengers, And lips that to my kisses part and move With passionate words which yet—how strange!—are hers, Pleading for love. Why do I love? If one had told me this, When I erewhile in the world's wilderness Wandered uncertain or of Heaven or Hell, How had I laughed as at a time-worn tale! To-day, behold. I too speak prophecies, And hang my votive garland in the grove, And supplicate my god, and kneel and kiss Her feet for love. Why do I love? Ah, love, I will not make A longer reasoning even for thy sake; Be it enough that I am pleasure's thrall. Tell me thy will, in song or madrigal Or word unspoken. Bid me bend or break, And brave all wraths of Earth or Heaven above, But not thy wrath. Ah! bid me not awake. Bid me still love. PICTURES ON ENAMEL When Astraled was lying, like to die Of love's green sickness, all his bed was strown With buds of crocus and anemone, For other flowers yet were barely none, And these he loved. And so it came to pass That, when they deemed he slept, then one by one The watchers left him for the Candlemas; And thus he chanced upon his bed alone When the day broke. You might have deemed he was An image of Hope slain by drear Oblivion. The chamber where he lay was hushed as sorrow, Which is joy's anteroom. The holy night, In silent expectation of the morrow, Gazed on the moon, as some fair anchorite On her own chastity, until the sight Made her heart ache. But, as the morning broke, Down the dim lobby came Somandolin, With her thick hair around her like a cloak, Even to her feet. I wot she might have been The dawn's own sister. Clad in mystic white, More beautiful than awe, came that fair woman in. Long while she stood before the dreaming boy, Still as he lay on crimson cushions piled. And when she bent o'er him, her breath did toy With his dank hair. Long while she stood and smiled As smiled Elisha on the widow's child In Shunam. For although her lips were sad As a broken bow, if you had read their meaning You would have learned the sense that smiling had Was less of sorrow than of joy beguiled To grief at the sad world and its revealing, As when the name of Death is whispered to a child. Doubtless that lady knew the spell to win The life-blood back; for, when she bent her down And laid her cheek to his that was so thin, The shut lips quivered and let fall a moan, As in sweet pain. And next Somandolin Put her white hand upon the sleeper's arm Entangled in his tresses. She could feel The curls crisp back like leaves when they grow warm Before a watchfire. Then she took his chin In her two palms, and bade his eyes unseal Their close-shut lids, and laid her lips upon his own. Slowly, as in a trance of wonderment, Those blue eyes opened wide, as from the dead His spirit stole. Old memories came and went Like summer lightnings, and a murmur sped To his dull ear, until he deemed it said, In a new tongue which none might heed but he, “Arise and worship, for behold thy bed And all about thee is as holy ground!” And then he cried, “Behold, dear love, I rise!” And on a sudden, waking from his swound, A countenance of tearful majesty And strange ecstatic love looked in his eyes. These things were written for a mystery In the Book of Life, lest lovers in their need Should faint for hunger by the road and die. Thus were they written. Though a god should read, He could not choose but learn a newer creed, Transcending his own knowledge. For anon, The Mass being ended, came the rest with speed, Bearing with them the blest viaticum And holy oils, nor guessed he needed not, Who sought him a long hour. The warder told Erewhile a knight, belike Sir Astraled, With a white lady rode the castle out, And all his harness was of burnished gold, Who, pricking fast towards the rising sun, Was gone beyond the hills upon his battle-steed. ADONIS The gods did love Adonis, and for this He died, ere time had furrowed his young cheek. For Aphrodité slew him with a kiss. He sighed one sigh, as though he fain would speak The name he loved, but that his breath grown weak Died on his lips. So died the summer breeze; And all the wood was hushed a minute's space, Where I stood listening underneath the trees, Until a wood-chat from her secret place Chirped in an undertone, “He is not dead, Not dead, for lo! the bloom upon his face Is ruddy as the newly-blossomed rose Which even yet is woven round his head. But sleep, more sweet than waking dream, doth close The laughter of his eyes. He is not dead.” Alone in that fair wood the livelong day And through the silent night I watched him near. But in the morning he was fled away, When broke the dawn upon me cold and clear. I looked within the thicket where he lay; And lo! the sod, which he had pressed in death, Was white with blossoms, scattered from the may, Which made the thick air sweet with their sweet breath. But he was gone; and I went o'er the heath, Clutching, like one distraught, the dim air grey With dawning,—for a voice encompassed me, Crying, “Fair boy, thy youth was but a span, Yet did it circle in eternity. Thy epic was accomplishèd. A man Fills but the measure of his destiny, And thine was all complete. Ere age began To mar the royal palace of thy youth With upper storeys of less perfect plan, Death, kindly Death, filled with immortal ruth, Took back the trowel from the builder's hand, And wrote his ‘fecit’ on thy work of truth.” A NOCTURNE The Moon has gone to her rest, A full hour ago. The Pleiads have found a nest In the waves below. Slow, the Hours one by one In Midnight's footsteps creep. Lovers who lie alone Soon wake to weep. Slow-footed tortoise Hours, will ye not hasten on, Till from his prison In the golden East A new day shall have risen, And the last stars be gone, Like guests belated from a bridal feast? When the long night is done Then shall ye sleep. SONG.—THE DEATH OF THE ROSE Ah! life, dear life, thy summer days have flown Swiftly yet all too late, for they did wither. Joy should be joy for one short hour alone, Or it will lose its loveliness for ever. I did not spare to use the cruel knife, But cut the rose as soon as it was day, And gave it to my love. Its little life Passed, like a sigh, from Nature's breast away. Full-hearted flower, thou didst not shrink nor flee When the steel touched thee. No sad memories Made what thou knew not terrible to thee, And death came on thee like a sad surprise. Too happy flower! I would my love had died At unawares, by such a death as thine. I should have slain my love in its full pride, So had it lived and been for ever mine, A treasure for all joy to ponder on, Laid up for aye in old Time's palaces, A “thing of beauty” which my soul had won, And death had made undying with a kiss. SONG OF THE DESERT LARK Love, love, in vain We count the days of Spring. Lost is all love's pain, Lost the songs we sing. Sunshine and Summer rain, Winter and Spring again Still the years shall bring, But we die. Love, what a noon Of happy love was ours! Grief came too soon, Touched the Autumn flowers, Grief and the doubt of death, Mixed with the roses' breath. Darkly the Winter lowers, And we die. His torch, love, the Sun Turns to the stormy West, Like a fair dream begun Changing to jest. Love, while our souls are one, Still let us sing the Sun, Sing and forget the rest And so die. SONG.—GLAD BIRD, I DO BEWAIL THEE Glad bird, I do bewail thee, Thy song it was so sweet That Earth looked up to hail thee Till wings grew to her feet. But, ah! thy mate is lying dead Among the new-mown hay, And a fowler comes to jail thee Where thou shalt pine away. Bright butterfly, I wail thee, So dainty was thy wing, So bravely didst regale thee On every honied thing. But thou art all too lightly clad For any month but May, And Autumn rains shall trail thee And wash thy paint away. Sweet childhood, I bewail thee. Thy smile it shifteth ever As the ship that thou dost sail thee Adown the running river. But ah! life's river runneth fast And forward lies the sea, And what shall then avail thee Thy laughter and thy glee? And youth, I most bewail thee, Thy purpose was so great, But the fools that did assail thee Were stronger than thy fate, And thy heart it was so ruddy red That every archer knew Where he might best impale thee And drive his arrows through. SONG.—WILT THOU TAKE ME FOR THY SLAVE? Wilt thou take me for thy slave, With my folly and my love? Wilt thou take me for the bondsman of thy pride? Thou who dearer art to me than all the world beside; For I love thee as no other man can love. Wilt thou take me to thy soul, For the truth which thou shalt prove? Wilt thou clothe me with the riches of thy care? Thou who dearer art to me than gold and jewels rare; For I love thee as no other man can love. Wilt thou take me for thy king, While the sun and stars shall move? Wilt thou pay me back the homage I have given? Oh thou dearer unto me than sun and stars and heaven! For I love thee as no other man can love. SONG.—FOR THEE What woes are there I would not choose to bear For thy dear sake? Curses were blest, the ache Of sorrow's scourging and grief's crown of care. All pain were dear to me, But it must be For thee. A sun grown cold, Earth wrapped in vaporous fold, The corn-flowers' head Robbed of their blue and red, The buttercups and daisies of their gold. This could I choose to see, But it must be For thee. The notes unheard Of lark and piping bird, Or else their songs Replaced by harsher tongues, No voice to sing to me or speak a word. This too were joy to me, But it must be For thee. A life alone, One left with others gone, A mourning house, Where none moves but the mouse Or knows the secret of its pale guests flown. Grief's tears were sweet to me, But it must be For thee. Night without sleep, Slow hours that halt and creep, A cheerless bed Where Love nor lays his head Nor looks with pity on blind eyes that weep. Watching were rest to me, But it must be For thee. Passion, once sure, With vain expense grown poor, Cheeks ruddy white Now crocussed with affright, And Love the guest all coldly shown the door. Love's loss were gain to me, But it must be For thee. Glory forsworn, The World's praise changed to scorn, Silence of friends, Foes gaining all their ends Through fault of fortune and my sword undrawn. Hatred were love to me, But it must be For thee. Life's purpose vast Turned to base ends and cast On lines of ill Which faltering downward still Shall topple headlong to the gulf at last. Life's shame were pride to me, But it must be For thee. A guarded cell, Where crime and madness dwell, Where murder creeps And maniac laughter weeps, With the undying worm for last farewell. There let me die, sad me, But it must be For thee. O Soul of mine! Thou wert a thing divine, But made in vain. Then be thou broke in twain And spilled upon time's empty sands like wine. My soul no Heaven would see, But it must be For thee. THE STRICKEN HART The stricken hart had fled the brake, His courage spent for life's dear sake. He came to die beside the lake. The golden trout leaped up to view, The moorfowl clapped his wings and crew, The swallow brushed him as she flew. He looked upon the glorious sun, His blood dropped slowly on the stone, He loved the life so nearly won, And then he died. The ravens found A carcase couched upon the ground, They said their god had dealt the wound. The Eternal Father calmly shook One page untitled from life's book. Few words. None ever cared to look. Yet woe for life thus idly riven. He blindly loved what God had given, And love, some say, has conquered Heaven. SONG.—LILAC AND GOLD AND GREEN Lilac and gold and green! Those are the colours I love the best, Spring's own raiment untouched and clean, When the world is awake and yet hardly dressed, And the stranger sun, her bridegroom shy, Looks at her bosom and wonders why She is so beautiful, he so blest. Lilac and green and gold! Those were the colours you wore to-day, Robed you were in them fold on fold, Clothed in the light of your love's delay. And I held you thus in my arms, once only, And wondered still, as you left me lonely, How the world's beauty was changed to grey. Lilac and gold and green! I would die for the truth of those colours true! Lilac for loyalty, gold for my queen, And green the faith of my love for you. Here is a posy of all the three. My heart is with it. So think of me, And our weeping skies shall once more be blue. SONG.—TO HER WHOSE NAME To her whose name, With its sweet sibilant sound like sudden showers Splashing the grass and flowers, Hath set my April heart aflame; To her whose face, The flower and crown of all created things, Dearer than even Spring's, Hath been to me a sacrament of grace; Whose luminous mind, Stored with all gladness of the earth and sky, Hath lightened my sad eye And made it wise in love which erst was blind; Whose voice of pleasure, Calling to joys as a blithe wedding bell When ringers ring it well, Hath tuned my soul to its own happy measure; Whose blessed hand, With its white mystery of fingers five, Each one a soul alive, Hath taught me truths no angels understand; Whose arms within, Should she once clasp me to her very heart, God knoweth we should not part But live for aye in Heaven's own bliss divine; To her, alas, Who is so near, yet standeth still so far, Seeing the mortal bar Betwixt us ever which we cannot pass, These lines I send With my heart's tears to-night beseeching her, Of her dear love more dear, To be no less to me my sweetest soul and friend. DEAD JOYS Moan on with thy loud changeless wail, Desolate sea, Grinding thy pebbles into thankless sand. Oh, could I lash my angry heart like thee Until it broke upon an iron land, The very rocks should tremble and turn pale To be the witness of my agony. Fierce wind, the sob of thy dull pitiless voice Is thick with snow. Hiss out thy tale into my ice-bound ear In sleety whispers, for full well I know That in thy wanderings thou hast seen my joys, My young joys, dead in some far hemisphere, A land of blackness and colossal woe. Naked they lay, my shipwrecked mariners, Upon the shore. The low moon pointed her long fingers, red As a murderer's hand, between their prison bars In the ribbed wreck, which hungry ocean tore At the first spring-tide to reclaim the dead And hide them in his jaws for evermore. Tell me, thou silence, what sad death they died, Poor castaways! What wolfish eyes were on each other there, When they had eaten all that hunger stays, And thirst no longer could be quenched with pride! Didst thou not see their teeth grow white and bare, Grinding a savage thought for many days, Until they fell upon their own red hearts? Thou didst not see, Or Thou hadst surely had some pity, God, When they crept gnawing to the vital parts, My joys, which I had nursed so tenderly In the very cradle of my love's abode. Or art Thou pitiless as wind or sea? AT A FUNERAL I loved her too, this woman who is dead. Look in my face. I have a right to go And see the place where you have made her bed Among the snow. I loved her too whom you are burying. I have a right to stand beside her bier, And to my handful of the dust I fling, That she may hear. I loved her; and it was not for the eyes Which you have shut, nor for her yellow hair, Nor for the face which in your bosom lies. Let it lie there! Nor for the wild-birds' music of her voice, Which we shall hear in dreams till we too sleep; Nor for the rest, which made the world rejoice, The angels weep. It was not for the payment of sweet love, Though love is often straitened for a kiss, Nor for the hope of other joys above, But only this, That she had laid her hand upon my heart Once in the summer time when we were young, And that her finger-tips had left a smart, And that my tongue Had spoken words which might not be unspoken Lest they should make a by-word of love's truth, And I had sworn that love should be the token Of my youth. And so I gave her all, and long ago The treasure of my youth was put in pawn; And she was little richer that I know When that was gone. But I have lived a beggar since that day And hide my face it may be from men's eyes; For often I have seen them shrink away, As in surprise That such a loathsome cripple should be found To walk abroad in daylight with the rest, And scarce a rag to cover up the wound Upon his breast. Yet no man stopped to ask how this might be, Or I had scared them, and let loose my tongue, How I had bought myself this misery When I was young. Yet I have loved her. This must be my pay, The pension I have earned me with these tears; The right to kneel beside her grave to-day, Despite these years, With all her kisses burning on my cheek, As when I left her and our love was dead, And our lips trembled though they did not speak, The night I fled; The right to bid you stand aside, nor be A witness of our meeting. Did you love In joy as I have loved in misery? You did not prove Your love was stronger than the strength of death, Or she had never died upon your hand. I would have fed her breathing with my breath; I would have fanned A living wind of Heaven to her lips; I would have stolen life from Paradise. And she is dead, and you have seen eclipse Within those eyes. If I could know that you had loved her well; If I could hold it for a certainty That you had sold your life as I did sell; If I could see The blackness of your soul, and with my tongue Taste the full bitterness of tears unshed; If I should find your very heart was wrung And maimed and dead; If I should feel your hand's grasp crumble mine, And hug the pain when I should grasp in turn; If I could dip my fingers in the brine Of eyes that burn; If I could hear your voice call back the dead With such a mighty cry of agony That she should turn and listen in the bed Where she doth lie, And all the heavens should together roll, Thinking they heard the angel's trumpet tone, I could forget it that you bought a soul Which was my own; I could forget that she forgot her vows, That aught was bartered for the wealth of love; I could untell the story of my woes, Till God above Should hold her guiltless and condone the wrong Done to His justice; I could take your hand And call you brother, as we went along To take our stand Before His judgment-seat with her again Where we are hurrying,—for we could not keep Our place unchallenged in the ranks of men Who do not weep. THE BROKEN PITCHER Accursed be the hour of that sad day The careless potter put his hand to thee, And dared to fashion out of common clay So pure a shape as thou didst seem to me. An idle boy, when vintage was begun, I passed and saw thy beauty for my sin, And poured unheedingly till it was done The red wine of my love's first gathering in. And thou, ah! thou didst look at me and smile To see me give with such ungrudging hand, As taking all to thy dear heart, the while It only fell upon the thirsty sand. Sad pitcher, thou wast broken at the well, Ere yet the shepherd's lip had tasted thine. A god had lost in thee his hydromel, As I have wasted my poor wealth of wine. Yet, wherefore wast thou made so fair a thing? Or why of clay, whose fabric rightly were Of finest gold, new-fashioned for a king, And framed by some divine artificer? I will not curse thee, thou poor shape of clay, That thou art other than thou seemed to be, Yet I will break thee, that no passer may Unthinking break another heart on thee. AN UNWRITTEN TRAGEDY Ho, ye that thirst beside the running stream! Love is a running stream, whose waters flow Upon the earth, and who would drink thereof Must bend him earthwards. There was such an one Who lay upon his belly in the mire And was not ashamed. Because he deemed it well That love, which is the strength of weaker things, Should make of Man a child. And, while he lay And summer winds were drowsing in his ears, The river of his love went rippling by. And thus he lived, and thus he might have died, Deaf to his fellows' scorn, and held it gain To lie a living corse unburied there Among the reeds of Time and hidden in From the world's stare. But Fate was watching him With envious eyes; and he had merited In truth much retribution at her hand. —Alas that I should have such spite to tell! She took her vengeance at the fountain head, And made a desolation in the land. And how he dreamed and half outwitted Fate, Because his mind was single in his love; And how she took the pitiless winds in pay And set a wrack of clouds upon their back; And how, because she could not master him, She turned the waters of his love away; And how that man arose up from his lair, Foul with the ooze and with a beard grown grey Through his long shame; and how he turned and fled From the sun's face to dwell among the tombs, I would relate. And, if in simple words How some have learned the nakedness of truth, The carelessness of God, Man's cruelty And their own folly, it would be a tale To chill the lust of Youth and bend the knees Of Manhood's pride before the strength of Fate Which conquers all;—And this I think would be The sum of human tragedy on Earth. —But who am I to stay the wings of Death And pluck a feather out and write such things? REQUIESCIT I cannot tell his story. He was one To whom the riddle of our human life Was strangely put, and who, because of that And that he could not read it, died. But a short hour Before he passed, the woman who stood by, Weeping as once she had wept to see him born, Tired with her watching looked into his face And saw the heavy eyelids dropping down Loaded with sleep. And she, for all her tears, Bent for the hundredth time to ease his bed. And, as she almost touched him, smoothing out The ruffled pillows, close into her ear He whispered, never lifting up his eyes: “No matter now. I shall be soon asleep.” And then, as if he would pursue the thought A little way as once he loved to do, And yet too weak to catch it, he went on: “And what a trouble it has been to keep This pillow smooth! And in a little while It will not want another touch; and then— This aching head of mine will have done with thought. Thought! Thought!” But loud the aged woman sobbed, “Poor soul, poor gentleman.” So they remained For a brief space, the goodwife standing there Knotting her wrinkled hands and he hard by Upon the bed and breathing heavily. For he seemed sunk again in that dull trance Through which men often pass away from life, When death, as the lion does, has shaken his prey And he lies numb and dumb and powerless. She listened. He was telling slowly over The names of those whom he had loved in youth. Many were strange to her; and then there came One she knew well. She started at the sound She had not heard for years, and bending near Heard him repeat it twice. She whispered hoarsely: “Have you no word for her?”—yet stopped again Because his eyes were open. Doubtingly They wandered to her own and seemed to say “Who, and what is it that you ask?” And she Spoke it again. He seemed to catch the name And said it after her, but like a child Which knows not what it speaks; and afterwards: “Ah! Bridget, I have quite forgot that story, And now, in half an hour, it is not long, I shall have clean forgotten the name too.” She cried, “Oh Sir, it is a life too late. Would God you had forgot it long ago!” The tears stole slowly down her withered cheeks And fell upon his hands. She did not move While he went murmuring on: “'Tis very well Thus to forget. And what a wonder too It now is”—and there came a sudden light Into his eyes—“that one should ever care To recollect a single day of life. I used to think and plan and plot and scheme How I might build my life in such a way That I should take fine memories to my grave. And now what a small matter 'tis to know How the years went, when death in half an hour Is all that is left of them! No matter now, But only to sleep sound in any bed And have no dreams.” His eyes grew dim again As he ceased speaking. And the woman knew That he was dying. “He is gone,” she said. And then she started muttering half aloud “They cannot pass without the sacraments, These gentle-folks.” And so she hurried out. The dying man smiled. When they came again, She whispered in his ear, and looking down Saw him still smiling; so she lit in haste A candle by the bed and knelt aside. They put the holy oils upon his hands, Which closed upon the fingers of the priest. The priest bent over him and laid his ear To the half-open mouth and presently, Thinking he heard some words, gave absolution. But, when they would have gone on with the rest, They found that he was dead. They buried him With some small pomp to comfort the old dame, Who said her master was a gentleman And must be followed with a mourning coach And mutes and weepers. There was no one else. His name is cut upon a stone. His dreams Were written on Time's hem; and Time has fled And taken him and them. The grass is green Upon his grave. I cannot doubt he sleeps. IN THE NIGHT Where art thou, thou lost face, Which, yet a little while, wert making mirth At these new years which seemed too sad to be? Where art thou fled which for a minute's space Shut out the world and wert my world to me? And now a corner of this idle Earth, A broken shadow by the day forgot, Is wide enough to be thy hiding place, And thou art shrunk away and needest not The darkness of this night to cover thee. Where art thou hidden? In the boundless air My hands go forth to thee, and search and feel As through the universe. I hold the night Caught in my arms, and yet thou art not there. Where art thou? What if I should strike a light So suddenly that thou couldst never steal Back to thy shadows? What if I should find Thee standing close to me with all thy hair Trailing about me and thine eyes grown blind With looking at me vainly through the night? There are three rings upon thy hand to-night, One with a sapphire stone, and one there is Coiled like a snake, and one on which my name Is written in strange gems. By this dim light I cannot read if it be writ the same. See, I have worn no other ring but this! Why dost thou look at it with eyes estranged? Is it not thine?—Ah, God! Thou readest right! And it is changed, and thou and I are changed, And I have written there another name. Oh happiness, how has it slipped away! We, who once lived and held it in our hand! What is the rest that these new years can bring? Did we not love it in our love's to-day, And pleasure which was so divine a thing, The sweetest and most strange to understand? And that is why it left regret behind, As though a wild bird suddenly should stay A moment at our side and we should find When we looked up that it had taken wing. And thou, hast thou forgotten how to love? Hast thou no kissing in thy lips? Thy tongue, Has it no secret whisper for my ear? I have been watching thee to see thee move A little closer to my side in fear Of the long night. Oh, there is room among The pillows for thy head if thou wouldst sleep! And thou art cold, and I would wrap my love To my warm breast and so my vigil keep And be alone with darkness and with her. Thou standest with thy hand upon my heart, As once thou used to stand, to feel it beat. Doth it beat calmer now than in those days? Thy foolish finger-tips will leave a smart, If they so press upon my side. Thy gaze Is burning me. Oh speak a word and cheat This darkness into pain, if pain must be, And wake me back to sorrow with a start, For I am weary of the night and thee And thy strange silence and thy stranger face. Canst thou not speak? Thy tale was but begun. How can I answer thee a tale untold? Whisper it quick before the morning break. How loud thou weepest! Listen, there is one Dreaming beside me who must not awake. Close in my ear !—Ah! child, thy lips are cold, Because thou art forsaken.—Misery! Is there not room enough beneath the sun For her, and thee, and me? TO HESTER ON THE STAIR Hester, creature of my love, What is this? You love not me? On the stair you stand above, Looking down distrustfully With the corners of your eyes Watching me in mute surprise, Me, your father, only me. Hester, why this foolish terror, You who know me and my ways? Was my love so writ in error That it needed your disgrace? Is your doubt of locks grown thin Or the beard which hides his chin His, your father's chin and face? Hester, we were fools of passion When our last goodbyes were smiled. Now you stand in your strange fashion By my kisses unbeguiled, With your light foot turned to flee While I press you to my knee, You, my child, my only child. Listen, Hester, I am able Still to flatter and be fond: You the wise crow of the fable Perched above me and beyond. Foolish! Not one word you speak To my praises of your cheek, Not one sound, one only sound! Be it so. My love you mock it, And my sighs are empty wind. See, I shut my heart and lock it From your laughing eyes unkind. Yet, remember this last word, Love is two-edged like a sword. Mind this only, only mind! A SUMMER IN TUSCANY Do you remember, Lucy, How, in the days gone by We spent a summer together, A summer in Tuscany, In the chestnut woods by the river, You and the rest and I? Your house had the largest garden, But ours was next to the bridge, And we had a mulberry alley Which sloped to the water's edge. You were always talking and laughing On your side of the hedge. How many sisters and brothers, Lucy, then did you own? Harriet and Francis and Horace And Phyllis, a flower half-blown. I liked you more than the others, For you had the longest gown. What has become of the laughter, What of the mulberry trees? Is there no record in Heaven, No echo of days like these? Francis is married and happy And Horace beyond the seas. Phyllis was first to desert us, She had no soul for the Earth But lingered a guest impatient Alike of our sorrow and mirth. Death's step to her on the threshold Seemed news of a glorious birth. Harriet, whose eyes were the brightest The fullest of innocent guile, Has hidden her joy and our sorrow Under a Carmelite veil. They call her the “mother abbess.” She has hardly leisure to smile. Do you remember the ponies We used to ride on the hill, Every knee of them broken, Every back like a quill, Cesare, Capitano, Milor and Jack and Jill? High o'er the plains and the valleys, Wherever our leader led, We two, closest of allies, Were with him still in his tread, Sworn to be first on his footsteps, To serve him alive or dead. Dead—ah dead! Who could think it? The laughter so strong on his lips Had seemed an elixir of living. Where now are his jibes and his quips, The fair paradoxes he flung us, The fire of him?—Lost in eclipse! All are scattered and vanished, Laughter and smiles and tears, Gone with the dust on the sandals Which cling to the feet of the years. Time has no time to remember, And Fortune no face for our fears. Do you remember, Lucy, The day which too soon had come, The first sad day of the Autumn, The last of our summer home, The day of my journey to England And yours to your convent at Rome? We rose with the dawn that morning— —The others were hardly awake— And took our walk by the river. Lucy, did your heart ache? Or was it the chill of the sunrise That made you shiver and shake? Lucy, the dog rose you gave me Still lies in its secret place. Lucy, the tears, my fool's answer, Have left on my cheeks a trace. The kiss you gave me at parting I yet can feel on my face. These are the things I remember. These are the things that I grieve, The joys that are scattered and vanished, The friends I am loath to leave. I grudge them to death and silence And age which is death's reprieve. Vanished, forgotten and scattered, All but you, Lucy, and I, Who cling some moments together Till Time shall have hurried us by: A moment and yet a moment, Till we too forget and die! SONG.—THEY SHALL NOT KNOW When thou art happy, thou dear heart of pleasure, Because men love thee and the feasts are spread, And Fortune in thy lap has poured her treasure, And Spring is there and roses crown thy head, Then think of one who loved thee for his woe, And, if thou sigh With others by, They shall not know. When thou art silent in thy day of trouble, Because fools vex and thou hast rivals found And love has played thee falser than a bubble And memory stings and grief is as a wound, Then think of one whose hand first soothed thy brow, And, if a smile Thy tears beguile, These shall not know. When all is ended, thou pale ghost of sorrow, And time's last flower is gathered from the grove, And yesterday to thee is as to-morrow And there is none to speak to thee of love, Then sing these songs one made thee long ago, And men shall swear Thou still art fair— Yet shall not know. SONG.—IF WE HAD MET If we had met when leaves were green, And fate to us less hard had proved, And naught had been of what has been, We might have loved as none have loved. If we had met as girl and boy, The world of pleasure at our feet, Our joy had been a perfect joy; We might have met, but did not meet. Nor less in youth's full passionate day, A woman you and I a man, We might have loved and found a way No laws could check, no vows could ban. Too late! Too sad! A year ago, Even then perhaps, in spite of fate It might have been,—but ah! not now, I dare not love you, 'tis too late. SONG.—IF I HAD KNOWN YOU If I had known you—oh, if I had known you! In other days when youth and love were strong, I would have raised a temple to enthrone you On some fair pinnacle of cloudless song. If you had touched me then with your dear laughter, As now its echo smites me in my grief, I would have given my soul to you, and after Lived in my love, grown old in my belief. If you had loved me,—oh, you would have loved me! Earth would have worshipped us, its seers sublime, My song had been a psalm, and Saints had proved me Prophet and priest, your poet for all time. SONG.—BUTTERFLIES O child of Joy! What idle life is thine! Thou, in these meadows, while thy skies are blue, And while thy joys are new to thee like wine, Chasest mad butterflies as children do. And lo, thou turnest from them to repine, Because it was not love thou didst pursue. O child of Hope! Thou sighest thy sad sighs, Mourning for that which is not nor can be. Where is the noon can match with thy sunrise? Whose is the heart shall win thy constancy? Thou, with thy foolish loves, mad butterflies, What dost thou ask of my sad heart and me? O child of Love, begotten for man's bliss! O child of Pleasure, nursed for thy own pain! Needs must I weep the day of thy distress, The fate that brushes at thy arm in vain, Thy skies of blue, thy broken happiness, The hopes thou chasest never to attain. SONG.—NOT A WORD Love, my heart is faint with waiting, Faint with hope and joy deferred, All night long at this sad grating, Sleepless like a prisoned bird, Singing low, Singing slow: Come, ah come, love.—Not a word! Love, in vain for thee this token Did I tie, poor silken cord, To my window. See, 'tis broken And the strands fly heavenward. All are free, All but me. Come, ah come, love.—Not a word! Lo, the first sad streak of morning Cleaves the heaven like a sword. Love, too late I hear the warning, Of thy footstep on the sward. Yet, ah yet, Though 'tis late, Come; but mind, love, not a word! SONG.—YOU HAVE LET THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY GO OVER You have let the beauty of the day go over, You have let the glory of the noon go by. Clouds from the West have gathered close and cover All but a remnant now of our proud sky. Dumbly the rain beats on our darkened faces. Hushed are the woods. Alas, for us no bird Shall sing to-day of pleasure in green places, No touch shall thrill, no soul of leaves be stirred. Why did we wait? What faith was ours in fortune? What was our pride that fate should kneel to us? Oh, we were fools. Love loves not to importune, And he is silent here in this sad house. Alas, dear love, the day for us is ended, The pleasure of green fields, of streams, of skies. One hour remains, one only of joy blended With coming night. Ah, seize it ere it flies. Draw fast the curtains. Close the door on sorrow. Shut out the dusk. It only makes us grieve. Here we may live a life,—and then, to-morrow, If fate still wills it, we may take our leave. A DREAM I dreamed A dream of you, Not as you seemed When you were late unkind And blind To my eyes' pleading for a debt long due, But touched and true And all inclined To tenderest fancies on love's inmost theme. How sweet you were to me and ah, how kind In that dear dream! I felt Your lips on mine Mingle and melt, And your cheek touch my cheek. I, weak With vain desires and askings for a sign Of love divine, Found my grief break, And wept and wept in an unending stream Of sudden joy set free, yet could not speak, Dumb in my dream. I knew You loved me then, And I knew too The bliss of souls in Heaven New-shriven, Who look with pity on still sinning men, And turn again To be forgiven In the dear arms of their God holding them, And spend themselves in praise from morn till even Nor break their dream. I woke In my mid bliss, At midnight's stroke, And knew you lost and gone. Forlorn I called you back to my unfinished kiss, But only this One word of scorn You answered me, “'Twas better loved to seem Than loved to be, since all love is forsworn, Always a dream.” LOVE AFTER SORROW Behold, this hour I love, as in the glory of morn. I too, the accursèd one, whom griefs pursue Like phantoms through a land of deaths forlorn, Have felt my heart leap up with courage new. Behold, I love. The tragedy of hate's derision Has like a storm-cloud vanished and is done. High in its path my hope has burst its prison And stands transfigured, a resplendent sun. Where are the ghosts of sorrow that beset my road, The foes that mocked, the fools that fled from me? Peace be their portion all who sought my blood. I care not for fear's bondage who am free. O days of youth renewed! Love's voice, a singing bird's, Thrills me to tears more sweet than laughters are. His silence godlike speaks to me in words Dearer than minstrelsy in lands afar. These halls, e'erwhile of pride, my sorrow's palaces, Are decked for joy, and with high pomps and shows Proclaim his lordship of all life that is In passionate echoes of remembered vows. The gardens are grown thick once more with scent of flowers Moss-roses by the wall, sweet lavenders, Larkspurs, red lilies. Who shall tell what dowers Of musks and mallows golden shall be hers? Hers? Whose? Oh, if a tongue should tell of dreams unwise And love might blazon love to ears abroad, How would I speak! But let this word suffice, That to my lips one name leaps like a sword, And that I live once more and love all sentient things, The spirit of the Earth, and the Sun's fire, And the night's silence and hushed wanderings, And her who is the soul of my desire. THE SOUL'S MUTINY I saw a galley passing to the West, Its silken sails aglow as if with blood, When the red sun dropped down into his nest, And hurled his level spears across the flood. And at its prow a mighty woman stood With braided locks of blackest ebony, While from the thick-fringed eyes her haughty mood Flashed forth in all disdainful majesty. For she was tall and vestured like a queen, And from her shoulders in imperial fold A stripèd tunic, wrought of black and green With strange device of dragons manifold, Fell to her waist and rippled o'er with gold, Where caught up in a girdle loosely bound, Then freely down in potent masses rolled And clung about her feet and clasped the ground. And ever and anon, with gracious smile Lighting the royal sculpture of her face, She gave commands. And each his joyful toil Plied at her word, and with redoubled grace Bent to his oar, and working still in place Did all her bidding. And the ship moved on As one which, wagered in a mighty race, Sailed surely to the front and surely won. And next I saw a slender child who seemed Sprung from the river god's unearthly dew, And in his face the light of wisdom gleamed And round about in flashing circles flew. And he arose and whispered to the few Who sat beside him, and to each in turn He told his counsel thus to all the crew In honied words which I had wished to learn. And at his voice each rower dropped his oar, And the sail flapped unguided on the mast, And discord rose, the while upon the shore Drifted the galley down the current fast. And she who stood upon the prow had cast Her angry words upon the storm in vain, Though her deep tones came pealing down the blast As though the heavens should be rent in twain. And then I marked her, when she first espied The fair child which had made this harm to be. There was great wonder mingled with her pride That one so tenderly designed as he Should dare dispute with her old mastery. And yet nor anger nor proud looks might quell The fearless eyes which smiled out mutiny, Till her own heart seemed stricken with the spell, With wonderment fast quickening to dismay, And a dull rage which smouldered 'neath her brows. And then rage, wonder, pride did fade away Before the cruel thought which lastly rose From out her mad heart with colossal throes, A thought so heavy-black that I did guess It came full freighted with the immortal woes Of an old god dethroned and heavenless. For, sudden, with a shout, her arms she threw High o'er her head, a torch in either hand, And round the ship the flames triumphant flew, The shrivelling sails fell low, while still she fanned With tempest voice the leaping fire which spanned The sinking galley with an arch of flame. I heard her thunder forth her last command And bid the traitors perish in their shame. The ship went down, and a sad cry arose, Stifled with smoke and rushing waters in. The silent stream, as heedless of men's woes, Went on its way as they had never been. The brave ship rots upon the ooze, I ween, And naked limbs lie stark upon the shore, Long ripples lap that angry-hearted queen And wash those mutinous eyes for evermore. SONG.—THINK NO MORE OF ME Think no more of me, If we needs must part. Mine was but a heart. Think no more of me. Think no more of me. For Love's sake forget. Love grows hard which cannot see, It may wound us yet. Think no more of me. Love has had his day. Now Love runs away. Think no more of me. Think no more of me. If we loved or not Hidden is 'twixt me and thee. It were best forgot. Think no more of me. We shall need our tears For the coming years. Think no more of me. Think no more of me. In the world above Sadder far it were if we Met and did not love. SONG.—COME WITH THE SUMMER LEAVES Come with the summer leaves, love, to my grave, And, if you doubt among the quiet dead, Choose out that mound where greenest grasses wave And where the flowers grow thickest and most red. Come in the morning while the dews of night, Which are fair Nature's tears in darkness shed, Rim the sad petals nor are garnered quite, Like my lost hopes untimely harvested. Come to my grave—ah gather, love, those flowers! Out of my heart they grow for your dear head. These are its songs unwritten and all yours, The love I loved you with and left unsaid. THE EVICTION Unruly tenant of my heart, Full fain would I be quit of thee. I've played too long a losing part. Thou bringest me neither gold nor fee. 'Tis time thou shouldst thy holding yield, Thy will and mine no longer meet. With cockle hast thou sowed my field, With squanderings all the public street. Thy presence doth disturb my pride. Let me be owner of my own. I fling thee with thy goods outside And bar re-entry with a stone. Begone and hide thee from my face. I will not see thee chiding there. Away, to live in my disgrace! Away, to die in thy despair! O impotence of human wit! The law is mine, the fault in thee, And yet in vain I serve the writ, In vain I scourge thee with decree. For lo, in stillness of the night, O'erturning stone and guard and door, Thou art come with thy lost tenant-right And hast possession as before. GOOD-BYE Fools! must we ever quarrel with our fate, Too late Reading the worth of what we did despise, And wise At the journey's end to weep it scarce begun When done? No more! 'Tis ever the same story told As of old. Children, we used to wish our childhood past: At last It ended, as this journey ends, and we Are free. Shall we lament? It were an idle tale To wail. Can we be wise? Oh wisdom comes too late, And fate Answers our wicked prayer for liberty: “Good-bye.” WRITTEN AT SEA What is my quarrel with thee, beautiful sea, That thus I cannot love thy waves or thee, Or hear thy voice but it tormenteth me? Why do I hate thee, who art beautiful Beyond all beauty, when the nights are cool, And the stars fade because the moon is full? Why do I hate thee? Thou art new and young, And life is thine for loving, and thy tongue Hath tones that I have known and loved and sung. Thou hast a smile which would my smiling greet; Thy brave heart beateth as my own doth beat, And thou hast tears which should be true and sweet. Thou art a creature, strong and fair and brave, Such as I might have given the world to have And love and cherish;—and thou art my slave. I have my home in thee. Thy arms enfold Me all night long, and I am rocked and rolled, And thou art never weary of thy hold. Thou art a woman in thy constancy, And worthy better love than mine could be; And yet, behold, I cannot suffer thee. If thou wert dumb; if thou wert like the sky, Which has not learned to speak our misery In any voice less rude than the wind's cry; If thou wert wholly young and didst not know The secret of our ancient human woe, Or if thou knewest it wholly as I know; Or yet if thou wert old with all these years; If thou wert dull to hopes and loves and fears; If thou wert blind and couldst not see our tears; If thou wert bounded by some rocky shore, And hadst not given thyself thus wholly o'er To our poor single selves with all thy store; If thou wert not in thy immensity, A single circle circling with the sky, Where we must still be centres changelessly; If thou wert other than thou art; alas, If thou wert not of water, but a mass Of formless earth, a waveless plain of grass; If thou wert shapeless as the mountains are; If thou wert clad in some discordant wear; If thou wert not so blue and trim and fair; If thou wert decked with towns and villages; If there was heard, across the silent seas, The music of church bells upon the breeze; If thou wert this; or if thou wert not near, But I could only sit apart and hear The beating of thy waves, and find it drear, But wild and quite unknown, and far from me; Sea, if thou couldst no longer be the sea, Then I could love thee as thou lovest me. If thou wouldst have me love thee, beautiful sea, Build up a wall of dark 'twixt thee and me; Let me not see thee; call the night to thee. League with the winds; rise up, and send them driven To roll mad clouds about thy back at even. Make thee a desolation of the heaven. Thou shouldst compel me, with thy angry voice, To choose 'twixt death and thee; and, at the choice, If my cheek grew not pale, thou might'st rejoice, And I might love thee, oh thou monstrous sea; But now I cannot love thy waves or thee, Or bear thy beauty in my misery. A DAY IN THE CASTLE OF ENVY The castle walls are full of eyes, And not a mouse may creep unseen. All the window slits are spies; And the towers stand sentinel High above the gardens green. Not a lizard lurking close In the brambles of the dell; Not a beetle as he goes, Toiling in the dust, may tell The least secret of his woes To the idle butterflies; Not a privet moth may flit, But the castle looketh wise, But the old king knoweth it. All day long the garden gates Open stand for who will in, For the old king loveth well The reek of human loves and hates. Most of all he loveth sin, All that sendeth souls to Hell; All that hath the earthy smell Of a joy that soon shall die. And he sitteth there and saith: “Every creature that hath breath Goeth with the taint of death.” There he waiteth overhead, Spieth out what he may spy, Like an evil-omened gled. From the morning till the night, There is nothing which doth move, There is nothing which can lie Still and hidden out of sight, But he seeth it above, But he feeleth all the pleasure Of its basking in the sun. And his wisdom taketh measure Of the sorrow which shall come When the summer days are done. Life and love are quickly run. So he watcheth silently, Waiting till the end shall be. There he sitteth at the dawn When the world begins to rouse; And the daisies on the lawn Open wide their stainless eyes; Then he feeleth as in pain For the wrinkles on his brows. He doth envy the sunrise, That it maketh all things gay; And his jealous ear hath heard The first piping of a bird; And he curseth at the day. But his curses are in vain For the world grows young again. From the shadow of the rocks, Stealing out and stealing in, Creeps the hungry foot-pad fox, On the wild fowls nestled close. Then a weirdly smile and thin Curleth on his lip and nose, As the red beast winds the flocks. And there is an evil mirth, In the glitter of his eye; For the sun hath warmed the earth, And he seeth something stir In the grass and then awake, Turn and stretch her stealthily; And he hisseth at the snake, As the heat unfoldeth her. There he bideth through the noon, While the pine tops clash together, Till deep silence, like a tune, Wrappeth all the earth and air; And the old king dreamily Noddeth his great heron feather, As he sitteth in his chair. For sleep cometh upon all, Rock and castle, flower and tree; And the turrets wave and quiver; And the battlemented wall Bendeth in the haze of noon, And the fir-cones one by one, Split like thunder in the heat; And the old king hearing it, Saith, “It is the angry sun.” But, as noontide slowly wears, From the hollows underneath Solemn ravens cross in pairs, Drop a hollow croak and pass, Which the king, who listeneth, Readeth for the name of Death. And he mocketh at the sound, Croaketh back a croak as hoarse: For he knoweth they are bound To the dell where, on the grass, There is that which was a corse. Suddenly a merry noise In the garden makes him glad, For he knoweth well what joys Noise and merriment shall bring. They are children come to tread The young daisies on the head; And he loveth well their play, For they take the butterflies And they tear them wing from wing; And the old king looketh wise At the footstep on the bed, And the broken myrtle spray; And he readeth all the lies Which their innocence shall tell. Well it pleaseth him such eyes Should have learned the speech of Hell. But at evening, lovers walk Underneath the ilex trees; And the king hath heard their talk, And the vows which they have spoken; And he knoweth too the tale Of the vows which they have broken, And the name and history, And the secret which doth lie Underneath their smiling pale; And the hidden tale of sorrow Of the maiden as she goes, And the pleasures she doth borrow, That her grief may learn to die. And he laugheth at her woes As his red eye reads the scrawl Love once wrote upon the wall, Love grown cold, whose tasting is Like the last lees of a kiss. Thus he sitteth till the sun Sendeth out long shadows slant Till the fish-tanks down beneath Hidden lie in vapour dun; And the castle rising gaunt Slowly stretcheth out its limbs, Like a drowsy-headed Hun. But when all is deep in shade, And the broad sun on the sea Lieth on his flaming bed, Twisteth, writheth in agony, Like a wizard fiery clad, Tortured and about to die, Then the old king goeth mad. And he curseth loud thereat; Curseth at the setting sun; Curseth at the coming night; Curseth at the flitting bat, And the stars which cannot see; Curseth at the pale moonrise, And her solemn mockery Of a daylight which is done; Thinketh, though he should curse the skies, Every hour till night is gone Naught his curses may devise For the pale moon's sorceries, Or the darkness which shall be. This the thought which tortureth him That, for all he watcheth close, Though his eyes be bright alway, And, for all that he is king, All the knowledge of all he knows Telleth not what night may bring, Telleth not what steps may stray. Then he sendeth forth a scout, Biddeth shut the garden gate: And there is a sudden rout Of the children and the lovers Whom the warder's eye discovers In the twilight lurking late, Lovers who are loath to part. But their prayers avail them not, And the maiden's witching pout Cannot melt the warder's heart. Straightway he hath turned them out. For along the castle wall Go the archers stout and tall, And the king, who sitteth still, In the darkness of the tower, Waiteth till the seneschal, With his stalwart serving-men, Bear him out against his will In his chair, while curses shower. To the banquet he is borne, While the cracked bell tolleth slow. And the king doth beat his breast Slowly to that chime forlorn; Beateth on his beard of snow, First in anger then in jest, First in mirth and then in scorn; Singeth low, “Ring bravely, bell, For thy voice is loud and dry. Such a tongue as thine is good To out-talk the chimes of Hell. Laugh we bravely, thou and I, While the world is in laughing mood. We may live to laugh its knell.” A BALLAD OF THE HEATHER We spent a day together, One day of all our lives, Of love in cloudless weather— Such only youth contrives— One day in the red heather, Alone with our two lives. The tall grey rocks were near us, The birch-trees lent us shade, The moorfowl did not fear us, Nor was the fox afraid. No other life was near us Of matron, man or maid. The glory of the morning Had made our pulses beat, The dangers we were scorning, The pleadings of retreat, Her mother's eyes of warning, The foes that we might meet. Earth's silence was our token, The sunlight on the hill. We whispered things unspoken, We stopped and gazed our fill. The stillness was not broken, Save thus at our own will. We sat down by the water, A green and quiet place. She ate what I had brought her When she had said her grace. She was Eve's fairest daughter. I kneeled and kissed her face. O Love, what deeds thou darest, When truth is on thy lips! What royal robes thou wearest! What wealth is in thy ships! What glories thou declarest With thy mad finger-tips! We called on the high Heaven In witness of our troth, From morning until even, While time was little loath To give and be forgiven The dear love in us both. Aloft the raven scouting Gave warning to the glen. We heard a sound of shouting The tramp of angry men. No time was there for doubting, And I was one to ten. I hid her in the braken, A brood-bird on its nest. She wept as one forsaken And held me to her breast. We dared not thus be taken. I fled, for it was best. They passed her by unheeded. They hunted me in sight. I lured them while she needed, A lapwing feigning flight. Then o'er the hills I speeded And left them to the night. Alas, dear love, together No more in all our lives Shall we in cloudless weather, Outwitting maids and wives, Take joy of the red heather And love and our two lives. ON THE WAY TO CHURCH There is one I know. I see her sometimes pass In the morning streets upon her way to Mass, A calm sweet woman with unearthly eyes. Men turn to look at her, but ever stop, Reading in those blue depths the death of hope And a wise chastisement for thoughts unwise. Pure is her brow as of a marble Saint. Her brown hair pencils it with ripples faint. There is no shadow on it and no light. Her cheeks are pale like lilies in eclipse. Hardly a little redness on her lips Paints the sad smile where all the rest is white. Tall is she and bent forward like a reed Which the wind toys with as she walks with speed: Girl-like her limbs and virginal her waist. Of the world's wonders there is none so sweet As this, the summer lightning of her feet, Speeding her onward like a fawn in haste. What is her secret? All the world has tried To guess it. One I knew in guessing died And was no wiser for his mortal pain. Each has turned sadder from the thankless quest, And gone back silent, even if he guessed, Knowing all answer would be counted vain. I knew her once. I know her not to-day. Our eyes meet sometimes, but hers turn away Quicker from mine than from the rest that look. Her pale cheek quivers, a flush comes and goes, As in the presence of a soul that knows, And her hands tighten on her missal book. Men have done evil yet have won to Heaven, Lived in blood guiltiness yet died forgiven. May I not, I too, one day win my grace? Ah no. The sacrilege of this worst sin Outweighs all grace. I dare not enter in Nor kneel, God's robber, near that angel face. GIACINTA Giacinta sat upon the garden wall Among the autumn lilies, and let fall Their crimson petals on her lover's head, And laughed because her little hands were red. She was the fairest child of Italy, And it was well the lilies thus should die. But Giulio shuddered when she made him kiss The stains away in her pride's wantonness And held them up between him and the sun That he might see the red blood flame and run In the long finger-clefts from root to tip, And still she pressed them closer to his lip, And still she laughed. But Giulio looked at her And it was half in love and half in fear. And, when she saw him tremble, childishly She laid both hands in his, and with a sigh Told him to pity them. And he in vain Hid them in his and would have hid his pain, And tried to speak but could not for the weight Upon his breast. And so the lovers sat In a hard silence, while Giacinta's laugh Rang in his ears like the discordant half Of some fair carol from a tavern flung, She watching him above, the flowers among, First with her smile and then with a hurt pride Kindling to wrath. And “Fool” at last she cried, “You think because this hand of mine is white And smooth to touch and wise in love's delight It had not dared to dabble in such red, The blood—of these dead flowers—for dead is dead; And you sit dumb and tremble and turn pale Because I laugh to see the lilies fall. Why not laugh with me, since you have the heart To say you love me in my tragic part? Think you that blood can make a hand less white, Or all the ink of heaven blot out to-night The innocent stars, or kisses steal away The sweetness of red lips, or memory Drive laughter from the world? The moon grows wan And wastes and fades and shrivels to a span, Yet men watch on beyond the hills at even, And lo there is a new moon in the heaven! Look in my eyes. Are they less pure and keen For all the passion which their depths have seen? Is there a stain upon my brows? My cheek Is it less fair for what it dares not speak? Oh, Simon's blood was not so red a thing But it has left my face its colouring. Or think you drops from any vein of his Could make my fingers blush as deep as this?” And Giulio's courage sickened when he heard Giacinta suddenly speak out this word. She was the fairest child of Italy, But Giulio thought it had been well to die. “yet, had it left me pale,” she said, “I know It had been all as one to Giulio To love a pale face. You will love me yet Though I have told you how my hands are wet, And when I hold them out to you to kiss Your lips will burn to drink away the lees. Oh, lovers, lovers! Wherefore will you preach, When women laugh at what you dare to teach Of truth and honour? Is there one of you, One honourable friend, one bosom true, That will not sell his virtue for a kiss Though the mouth that gave it were a nest of lies, And will not soothe his soul with the deceit Which swears a rose is not a whit less sweet Because an angry bee was in its cell An hour ago?—Oh, lovers reason well! So take the flower and deign forget the bee. But Giulio, do not bid me stop and see How beautiful a thing your virtue is, And do not cry to the unheeding skies ‘Did I not love her?’ See, I hate your love More than I hate yourself.” And Giulio strove With his weak heart and could not bear the pain. And so he took Giacinta's hand again, Without more word. But she in softened mood Looked on the boy her beauty had subdued, And said “Poor Giulio! I have never shown Much hate to you, and this you needs must own, Only beware of loving me. 'Tis strange That men are wise, yet cannot take the range Of a silly woman's mind, but still devise Of their fool's love, as if it were the prize For which a woman might forget the cost Of her undoing and a world well lost, And cannot see that love is only this, A pretty word to whisper in a kiss, As when one says, ‘God bless you’ with ‘Good-night.’ But Giulio, who would ever suffer it A man should always have the name of God Upon his lips?” Her lover only trod The lilies with his heel. At last he sighed, “And Simon loved you, and for this he died?” They sat till dusk upon the garden wall, And she began to sing a madrigal About the falling leaves and quite forgot To answer him. But Giulio heeded not Because he held her hand. He could not flee. She was the fairest child of Italy. THE WANDERER'S RETURN An old heart's mourning is a hideous thing, And weeds upon an aged weeper cling Like night upon a grave. The city there, Gaunt as a woman who has once been fair, Lay black with winter, and the silent rain Fell thro' the heavens darkly, like a stain Upon her face. The dusky houses rose, Unlovely shapes laid naked on the ooze, Grimed with long sooty tears. The night fell down, And gathered all the highways in its frown. This was my home. I saw men pass and pass Nor stop to look into a neighbour's face. I dared not look in their's because my eyes Were faint and travel-jarred and would not rise From the dull earth, and hunger made them dim, The hunger of a seven years' angry dream Of love and peace and home unsatisfied. And now my heart thus grievously denied Rose, like a caged bird in the nesting time Who beats against the bars that prison him, In all its greenness of youth's wounds and pain And would not cease till these should bleed again. For I had gone a hunter through the world, And set my tent in every land, and hurled My spears at life because my joys were dead; And many a fair field of the Earth was red Where I had passed, and many a wind might tell Of stricken souls that to my arrows fell. I would not stop to listen to their cries But went my way and thought that I was wise. A wanderer's life, whether his lone chase be man Or only those poor outlaws under ban The creatures of the field his hand destroys Through rage of wantonness or need of noise, Is the fierce solace of its anger given To a hurt soul which dares not turn to Heaven. With me it was a vengeance of love lost, A refuge proved for passions tempest-tossed, An unguent for despairs that could not kill. I wandered in the desert and the hill Seeking dry places, and behold my grief Fled with my footprints and I found relief. And it had happened to me, as befalls Men bred in cities who have left their walls For gain or pleasure, that the wilderness Grew lastly wearisome. I loved it less. And once a desperate chase had led me on To an unknown land when daylight was near done, And I sat weary by my slaughtered prey And watched the cranes which northward fled away Rank upon rank into the depths of air, And still the horizon lifeless vast and bare Stretched wide around, and like a vault of dread The arch of heaven hemmed me overhead, And the great eye of the dead beast was set Upon my own. I felt my cheek was wet. Oh surely then, for all man's heart be hard, Though he have taken Nature by the beard And lived alone as to the manner born, And though his limbs be strung with toil, and worn To all Earth's dangers, yet at such a time His coward soul will overmaster him, Saying “Beware, thou child of Earth, even now Look at the world how wide it is and thou How small! And thou hast dared to be alone.” And lo, the last long flight of cranes was gone, And darkness with its folding pity crept Over the plain. I hid my face and wept, Till sleep fell on me. But, when dawn was come, I turned my steps to what had been my home. The palace gardens! I had fled aside From the gaunt streets in easement of my pride After the lamps were lit, for to my brain The tumult and the passers-by were pain: The gardens where in those far summer times A boy I came to watch the pantomimes Among a laughing crowd of white-capped bonnes And red-cheeked children and loud country clowns, Or where, along the wall in graver sense And screened from winds in their petite Provence, With the first chestnut blossoms old men sat And cheered their melancholy souls with chat, Thawing like frozen apples in the sun! The old men and the children all were gone. The leaves, their canopy, lay torn and dead And crushed in spongy heaps beneath my tread. The fountains recreant to their laughter lay Murk pools of silence shrouded from the day, As though no doves had ever at their brink Stooped in full June to plume themselves and drink. Only the trees stood, witness of the past. Sad trees, I greeted them. I held them fast Like a friend's hands. They were as changed and bare As my own life, but calm in the despair Of their long winter's martyrdom, and I A very child in my philosophy! Till I remembered that no Spring would come To mock the winter of my own long doom With any merriment. And “Trees” I cried, “Your hearts within are all too greenly dyed To match with mine.” I let their branches go And sat upon a bench to feed my woe With memories long hidden out of mind, But which trooped back that night and rode the wind. These wooden benches, what sad ghosts of pleasures Had used them nightly crouching o'er their treasures, My own long murdered joys, since there we sat Blind in our love and insolent to Fate! Each one a witness proved of our lost vows, Our prayers, our protests, all our souls' carouse; Each one inscribed through the unheeding years With letters of a name I wrote in tears. 'Twas here I saw her first, a pure sweet woman Fair as a goddess but with smile all human, Her children at her knees who went and came At each new wayward impulse of their game, And she reproving with her quiet eyes Veiling the mirth they could not all disguise. The echo of her voice with its mute thrill Lived in these glades and stirred my pulses still, Though I had lived to hear it in what tone Of passionate grief and souls' disunion. She stood, a broken lily, by that tree, Sunlight and shade for ever changingly Chequering the robe she wore of virgin white, When first I touched the goal of my delight Her woman's hand and hid it in my hands. Here shone the glory of her countenance Nobler for tears when weakness for a space Held full dominion in that heaven her face And she confessed herself of grief divine And love grown young, a vintage of new wine, And I was crowned her king. O silent trees, You heard it and you know how to the lees We drained the cup of life and found it good, Gathering love's manna for our daily food, In scorn of the vain rest. You heard and knew What the world only guessed where all was true. And have you dreamed on in your quiet grove While seven years were built against our love! 'Twas on this bench I sat that day of June Thinking of death a whole sweet afternoon, Till I was sick of sorrow and my tongue Weary of its long silence (I was young And the birds sang so loud); and when the night Came as it now came, and the lamps grew bright In the long street, lit like a diamond chain, I rose and said: “I will not bear the pain. What is my pride worth that for it this smart Should harrow up the green things of my heart For twelve importunate hours in such a sort? And pleasure is so sweet and life so short.” And as a martyr, who long time has lain Frozen in a dungeon, sees amid his pain, When he has fasted on for many days, Bright visions of hot feasts and hearths ablaze With welcome, and who sells his gloomy creed, And is overcome of pleasure, so my need Conquered my pride; and I arose and went Striding, with smiles at my new found intent, Down these same gravel alleys to the gate And so beyond, like one inebriate, Thinking the while of the brave baths and food Set for the renegade, until I stood Once more before her door I had forsworn. I did not stop to question thoughts forlorn, But knocked as I had knocked a thousand times. St. Roch's was ringing its last evening chimes, And I still thought about the martyr's dream. I saw the light within the threshold gleam Which opened to me, and the voice I knew Said in all sweetness, as the door swung to, “Come. We are just in time. How fortunate You too like me have happened to be late.” I swear I said no word of the sad plans I had plotted on this bench of ignorance. There have been kings called happy, but not one As I that night. Ah God! to be alone, Alone, and never more to hear her voice Calling me back, blest martyr, to my joys! I sat there grieving in the cold and rain Until my heart had half forgot its pain, And when I rose I scarce could guide my feet, They were so numb, to the unlovely street. And yet need was my steps should bear me on To some mad corner of that Babylon; And I must feed the gnawings of my soul With broken meat. “The seven years may roll,” I said, “and men may change and she be dead, Yet the house stands, God knows how tenanted.” I leaned my head against the colonnade Which skirts the square. I think I had not prayed Through all those years, but now I said a prayer, And hope in spite of reason seemed to wear Green buds upon its branches. Who shall know If 'twas a vision sent me in my woe To prove the power of prayer? But, when I turned And looked across the square, the candles burned In the old upper windows, and, before, A shadow crossed the curtain, and the door Opened towards me, and a voice there cried “Come. You are just in time.” I put out wide My arms into the darkness, and I fell. When I awoke, 'twas as one passed from Hell Who fears and feels no longer. I was tired. I scarcely cared to know when I inquired After the house. The girl who held the glass To my lips (a flower-girl it seemed she was) Told me that house and square alike were gone Swept by new boulevards to oblivion. Why should I grieve? The new was worth the old. I listened to the story as 'twas told, And lingered with her all the evening there Because she pitied me and she was fair, And held me with her hand upon the latch. “Seven years,” I said, “it is a long night's watch For any soul alone upon life's way, And mine is weary at the break of day.” FROM THE ARABIC I THE CAMEL-RIDER There is no thing in all the world but love, No jubilant thing of sun or shade worth one sad tear. Why dost thou ask my lips to fashion songs Other than this, my song of love to thee? See where I lie and pluck the thorns of grief, Dust on my head and fire, as one who mourns his slain. Are they not slain, my treasures of dear peace? This their red burial is, sand heaped on sand. Here came I in the morning of my joys. Before the dawn was born, through the dark downs I rode. The low stars led me on as with a voice, Stars of the scorpion's tail in the deep South. Sighing I came, and scattering wide the sand. No need had I to urge her speed with hand or heel, The creature I bestrode. She knew my haste, And knew the road I sought, the road to thee. Jangling her bells aloud in wantonness, And sighing soft, she too, her sighs to my soul's sighs. Behind us the wind followed thick with scents Of incense blossoms and the dews of night. The thorn trees caught at us with their crook'd hands; The hills in blackness hemmed us in and hid the road; The spectres of the desert howled and warned; I heeded nothing of their words of woe. Thus till the dawn I sped in my desire, Breasting the ridges, slope on slope, till morning broke; And lo! the sun revealed to me no sign, And lo! the day was widowed of my hope. Where are the tents of pleasure and dear love, Set in the Vale of Thyme, where winds in Spring are fain? The highways of the valley, where they stood Strong in their flocks, are there. But where are they? The plain was dumb, as emptied of all voice; No bleat of herds, no camels roaring far below Told of their presence in the pastures void, Of the waste places which had been their homes. I climbed down from my watch-tower of the rocks, To where the tamarisks grow, and the dwarf palms, alarmed. I called them with my voice, as the deer calls, Whose young the wolves have hunted from their place. I sought them in the foldings of the hill, In the deep hollows shut with rocks, where no winds blow. I sought their footstep under the tall cliffs, Shut from the storms, where the first lambs are born. The tamarisk boughs had blossomed in the night, And the white broom which bees had found, the wild bees' brood. But no dear signal told me of their life, No spray was torn in all that world of flowers. Where are the tents of pleasure and dear love, For which my soul took ease for its delight in Spring, The black tents of her people beautiful Beyond the beauty of the sons of kings? The wind of war has swept them from their place, Scattering them wide as quails, whom the hawk's hate pursues; The terror of the sword importunate Was at their backs, nor spared them as they flew. The summer wind has passed upon their fields; The rain has purged their hearth-stones, and made smooth their floors; Low in the valley lie their broken spears, And the white bones which are their tale forlorn. Where are the sons of Saba in the South, The men of mirth and pride to whom my songs were sung, The kinsmen of her soul who is my soul, The brethren of her beauty whom I love? She mounted her tall camel in the waste, Loading it high for flight with her most precious things; She went forth weeping in the wilderness, Alone with fear on that far night of ill. She fled mistrusting, as the wild roe flees, Turning her eyes behind her, while fear fled before; No other refuge knew she than her speed, And the black land that lies where night is born. Under what canopy of sulphurous heaven, Dark with the thunderclouds unloosing their mad tongues, Didst thou lie down aweary of thy burden, In that dread place of silence thou hadst won? Close to what shelter of what naked rocks, Carved with what names of terror of what kings of old, Near to what monstrous shapes unmerciful, Watching thy death, didst thou give up thy soul? Or dost thou live by some forgotten well, Waiting thy day of ransom to return and smile, As the birds come when Spring is in the heaven, And dost thou watch me near while I am blind? Blind in my tears, because I only weep, Kindling my soul to fire because I mourn my slain, My kindred slain, and thee, and my dear peace, Making their burial thus, sand heaped on sand. For see, there nothing is in all the world But only love worth any strife or song or tear. Ask me not then to sing or fashion songs Other than this, my song of love to thee. II THE DESOLATE CITY Dark to me is the earth. Dark to me are the heavens. Where is she that I loved, the woman with eyes like stars? Desolate are the streets. Desolate is the city, A city taken by storm, where none are left but the slain! Sadly I rose at dawn, undid the latch of my shutters, Thinking to let in light, but I only let in love. Birds in the boughs were awake; I listened to their chaunting; Each one sang to his love; only I was alone. This, I said in my heart, is the hour of life and of pleasure, Now each creature on earth has his joy, and lives in the sun, Each in another's eyes finds light, the light of compassion, This is the moment of pity, this is the moment of love. Speak, O desolate city! Speak, O silence in sadness! Where is she that I loved in my strength, that spoke to my soul? Where are those passionate eyes that appealed to my eyes in passion? Where is the mouth that kissed me, the breast I laid to my own? Speak, thou soul of my soul, for rage in my heart is kindled. Tell me, where didst thou flee on the day of destruction and fear? See, my arms still enfold thee, enfolding thus all Heaven, See, my desire is fulfilled in thee, for it fills the Earth. Thus in my grief I lamented. Then turned I from the window, Turned to the stair, and the open door, and the empty street, Crying aloud in my grief, for there was none to chide me, None to mock at my weakness, none to behold my tears. Groping I went, as blind. I sought her house, my beloved's. There I stopped at the silent door, and listened and tried the latch. Love, I cried, dost thou slumber? This is no hour for slumber, This is the hour of love, and love I bring in my hand. I knew the house, with its windows barred, and its leafless fig-tree, Climbing round by the doorstep the only one in the street; I knew where my hope had climbed to its goal and there encircled All that those desolate walls once held, my beloved's heart. There in my grief she consoled me. She loved me when I loved not. She put her hand in my hand, and set her lips to my lips. She told me all her pain and showed me all her trouble. I, like a fool, scarce heard, hardly returned her kiss. Love, thy eyes were like torches. They changed as I beheld them. Love, thy lips were like gems, the seal thou settest on my life. Love, if I loved not then, behold this hour thy vengeance; This is the fruit of thy love and thee, the unwise grown wise. Weeping strangled my voice. I called out, but none answered; Blindly the windows gazed back at me, dumbly the door; She whom I love, who loved me, looked not on my yearning, Gave me no more her hands to kiss, showed me no more her soul. Therefore the Earth is dark to me, the sunlight blackness, Therefore I go in tears and alone, by night and day; Therefore I find no love in Heaven, no light, no beauty, A Heaven taken by storm, where none are left but the slain! III THE GRIEF OF LOVE Love, I am sick for thee, sick with an absolute grief, Sick with the thought of thy eyes and lips and bosom. All the beauty I saw, I see to my hurt revealed. All that I felt I feel to-day for my pain and sorrow. Love, I would fain forget thee, hide thee in deeper night, Shut thee where no thought is, in the grave with tears. Love, I would turn my face to the wall and, if needs be, die; Death less cruel were than thy eyes which have blinded me. Since thou art gone from me, glory is gone from my life; Dumb are the woods and streams, and dumb the voice of my soul; Dead are the flowers we loved, blackened and sere with blight; Earth is frost-bound under my foot where our footsteps trod. Give me back for my sorrow the days of senseless peace, Days when I thought not of thee, or thought in wisdom; Let me see thee once more as thou to my folly wert, A woman senseless as sounding brass or as tinkling cymbal. Why didst thou show me thy heart, which I thought not of? Why didst thou bare me thy soul, who to me wert soulless? Why didst thou kiss my mouth, when my mouth did mock? Why didst thou speak to my lips of love, ere my lips had spoken? Love, thou hast made me thine, thine, and in my despite, Laying thy hand on my heart in the soft Spring weather; Love, thou hast bought my soul at a price, the price of thine, Never again to mock at love, ah, never, never! IV A LOVE SECRET Love has its secrets, joy has its revealings. How shall I speak of that which love has hid? If my beloved shall return to greet me, Deeds shall be done for her none ever did. My beloved loved me. How shall I reveal it? We were alone that morning in the street. She looked down at the ground, and blushed, and trembled. She stopped me with her eyes when these did meet. “What wouldst thou, sweet one? What wouldst thou with sorrow, Thou, the new morning star with me, the night? What are those flowers thou holdest to thy bosom? What are the thoughts thou hidest from my sight?” “Thine are these flowers,” she said, “these foolish roses, And thine the thoughts, if thus it be thy will. I hold them close for fear that thou shouldst mock me, I hold them to my heart for fear of ill.” “Nay, what of ill? 'Tis only age is evil, Only forgetfulness and grief and pain; What dost thou know of grief, that thou shouldst fear it? Mine is the grief who cannot love again.” She raised her eyes, she looked at me in wonder, “The ache is here,” she said, “by night and day; I cannot teach my heart to bear its burden, I cannot turn my silence from its way.” “Speak to me, child. I am thy wise physician, A man acquainted with all grief can teach; There is no sorrow but has joy for sister, No silence but finds counterpart in speech.” My beloved laughed. She saw through my dissembling; She held to me her hand, that I might kiss, The inside of her hand. 'Twas like a petal Of her own roses, but more dear than this. I felt its pulses, like a bird in prison; “Sweet child,” I said, “what wouldst thou I should prove? I cannot make thee wiser than thy wisdom, Who knowest all things since thou knowest love.” How shall I tell it? How shall I reveal it? I led her by the hand, as thus I said, Back from the street to where it stood, my dwelling, And closed the door on where it stood, my bed. Her laughter stopped. “Nay, use not thou unkindly. Thine is the hand to deal or spare the blame; I dare not be to thee thus uninvited, Thou dost not know me, hast not learned my name.” How shall I tell it? How shall I reveal it? Love in that instant found its latest birth, “Soul of my soul,” I cried, “thy name is Pleasure, The sweetest thing to love on this sad Earth.” I held her in my arms, I pressed her fastly. “Ah, if thou lovedst me indeed,” she cried. “I love thee, and I love thee,” was my answer, “My sister, my beloved one, my bride!” Love has its secrets. Joy has its revealings. I speak of this which love in vain has hid; If my beloved shall return to greet me, Deeds shall be done for her none ever did. V [THE DAYS OF OUR YOUTH] These are the days of our youth, our days of glory and honour. Pleasure begotten of strength is ours, the sword in our hand. Wisdom bends to our will, we lead captivity captive, Kings of our lives and love, receiving gifts from men. Why do I speak of wisdom? The prize is not for the wisest. Reason, the dull ox, ploughs a soil which no joy shall reap. Folly is fleeter far 'neath the heel of the fearless rider, Folly the bare-backed steed we bestride, the steed of the plains. Mine is a lofty ambition, as wide as the world I covet. Vast is the empire I claim for thee, thou spouse of my soul. Show me new lands to win, and, by God in heaven, I swear it: These shall be mine and thine to-night for all time to hold. Time is our slave and Fortune's. We need not years for fruition. Here in our hands behold a key which unlocks the world. Each new day is a life. For us there is no to-morrow. Love no yesterday knows nor we, but to-day is ours. See, what a wealth I bring thee, what treasure of myrrh and spices! Every kingdom of Earth have I sacked to procure thee gold. All the knowledge that fools have learned at the feet of women, All that the wise have been taught in tears for thy sake I know. Give thyself up to Love. There is naught divine but madness. Give thyself up to me Love's priest in his inmost shrine. Shut thy eyes on the world, sublime in thy abnegation. Only the wise who have bowed their will shall receive the prize. Shut thy eyes on the light. I have nobler dreams to read thee, Here in the shades of this darkened room, than the sun can show. Is there not light in my eyes to-night more light than the dreamlight? See it breaks in streams on thy face; it illumes thy soul. Let me persuade thy weakness. I sue thee here with my reason. Let me convince thee of love with my lips till thou cease to think. Let me enfold thee with words more sweet than the prayers of angels, Speaking thus with my hand on thy heart till it cease to beat. Let me assuage thy grief with laughter, thy fear with kisses. Let me cajole thy doubts with surprise, thy pride with tears. Let me outshame the shame of thy face, outblush thy blushes. Let me teach thee what Love can dare and yet dream no shame. Let me uncover thy bosom and prove to thee its glory. Let me preach to thee of thyself the live night long. Let me chaunt new hymns to thy praise as I kneel and worship, Rising still like a god from my knees from eve till morn. Let me discourse of love with my hands and lips and bosom. Let me explain with my limbs the joy that a soul can feel. Let me unveil to thy bodily sense thy god incarnate Taking flesh in a visible form for thy body's need. Lo, on the mount of Love, the holiest place of holies, Incense and prayer and the people's shout and the fires have risen. Love descends on the feast. He mounts the pyre in silence, Victim and priest and god in one, to thy dreams revealed. There, the rite is accomplished. Whatever Love knows thou knowest. Sudden the victim staggers and falls. In the dust it lies. See the hot blood flows for thy sake, it o'erflows the altar. Dost thou not feel it stream in thy veins? It still lives in thee. These are the days of our youth, the days of our dominion. All the rest is a dream of death and a doubtful thing. Here we at least have lived, for love is all life's wisdom, Joy of joys for an hour to-day; then away, farewell! THE IDLER'S CALENDAR TWELVE SONNETS FOR THE MONTHS JANUARY COVER SHOOTING The week at Whinwood next to Christmas week. Six guns, no more, but all good men and true, Of the clean-visaged sort, with ruddy cheek Which knows not care. Light-hearted Montagu At the cover's end, as down the wind they flew, Has stopped his score of pheasants, every beak, Without more thought of Juliet than of you; And still I hear his loud-mouthed Purdeys speak. Tybalt and Paris, with a bet on hand, Have fired at the same woodcock. “Truce,” say I, “To civil jars.” For look, as by command, Bunch following bunch, a hundred pheasants fly. Now battle, murder, death on every side! Right, left, left, right, we pile up agony, Till night stops all. Then home in chastened pride, With aching heads, our slaughter satisfied. FEBRUARY UNDER THE SPEAKER'S GALLERY In all the comedy of human things What is more mirthful than for those, who sit Far from the great world's vain imaginings, To mingle in its war of words and wit, A listener here, when Greek meets Greek, Fox Pitt, At question-time in the Queen's Parliament? 'Tis the arena of old Rome. Here meet More than mere Dacians on mere slaughter bent. Yonder and close to Mr. Speaker's chair, Enfolding all things in a net of words, Stands our first gymnast. Let the rest beware. The Tory Stafford, with voice sweet as bird's, Shall answer him anon, or bolder borne And if luck favours, from the nether herds A voice of patriot wrath shall rise in scorn, Or even young Cassius blow his windy horn. MARCH A WEEK AT PARIS When loud March from the East begins to blow, And earth and heaven are black, then off we hie By the night train to Paris, where we know Three windows set to the meridian sky, A third floor in the Rue de Rivoli. There we will stop and see the fair world move For our sole pleasure past us, you and I, And make pretence we are once more in love. We need not fret at loss of pence or time, Though Father Bignon's smiles are paid in gold. This life in idleness is more sublime Than all our toil and all our wealth twice told. We need not fret. To-night for us shall Faure, Sara, Dupuis, or L'heritier unfold New stores of mirth and music, and once more We two shall sup, and at the Maison d'or. APRIL TROUT-FISHING This morning, through my window, half awake, I felt the south wind blow; and presently, With a tumultuous thrill and then a shake, The nightingale broke forth in melody. I rose in haste, and looked at the grey sky, And read an omen. From its corner next A book I drew, blest book, where fly on fly Are all the letters of its well-thumbed text. I chose my cast, a march-brown and a dun, And ran down to the river, chasing hope. At the first throw a mighty trout was on, A very Samson, fit to burst a rope, Yet tamed by one sad hank of yielding hair And Fate, the fisherman of King and Pope. Upon the grass he lies, and gasps the air, Four silver pounds, sublimely fat and fair. MAY THE LONDON SEASON I still love London in the month of May, By an old habit, spite of dust and din. I love the fair adulterous world, whose way Is by the pleasant banks of Serpentine. I love the worshippers at fashion's shrine, The flowers, the incense, and the pageantry Of generations which still ask a sign Of that dear god, whose votary am I. I love the “greetings in the market-place,” The jargon of the clubs. I love to view The “gilded youth” who at the window pass, For ever smiling smiles for ever new. I love these men and women at their task Of hunting pleasure. Hope, mysterious too, Touches my arm and points, and seems to ask “And you, have you no Juliet in the masque?” JUNE A DAY AT HAMPTON COURT It is our custom, once in every year, Mine and two others', when the chestnut trees Are white at Bushey, Ascot being near, To drive to Hampton Court, and there, at ease In that most fair of English palaces, Spend a long summer's day. What better cheer Than the old “Greyhound's,” seek it where you please? And where a royal garden statelier? The morning goes in tennis, a four set, With George the marker. 'Tis a game for gods, Full of return and volley at the net, And laughter and mirth-making episodes Not wholly classic. But the afternoon Finds us punt-fishing idly with our rods, Nodding and half in dreams, till all too soon Darkness and dinner drive us back to town. JULY GOODWOOD To the high breezes of the Goodwood Down London has fled, and there awhile forgets Its weariness of limb on lawns new-mown And in green shadows all its wars and frets. Thither we too will bring our calumets In sign of peace restored o'er fashion slain, Weaning our souls from folly with small bets Of gloves and crowns with laughing ringwomen. The sport is fair, luck fair, and Nature's face Fairest of all. We neither make nor mar A fortune here. Yet we were rich with less Than this week's pleasure conquered from the year. I would not for a million not have seen Fred Archer finish upon Guinevere. Hark! They are off again, a half mile spin, Four of the dozen backed and bound to win. AUGUST ON THE THAMES The river Thames has many a dear delight In summer days for souls which know not guile, Or souls too careless of the vain world's spite To heed its frowning while the heavens smile. In boyhood all our pleasure was in toil, As with bent backs we laboured at the oar; We loved to spend our strength in the turmoil Of speed disputed, conquered, conqueror. But other years brought other joys. Alas! Where is fair Rosamund, our heart's first queen, Whose foot so lightly trod with us the grass, Though burdened with the hundred loves of men, At Kew, at Skindle's? But no more of this. We still have joys, and still old Thames is green. Still on his back we float awhile and press His hand in hope, and call it happiness. SEPTEMBER FEAST OF ST. PARTRIDGE The only saint in all our calendar Is good St. Partridge. 'Tis his feast to-day, The happiest day of all a happy year, And heralded as never yet was May. The dawn has found us marshalled for the fray, Striding the close-shorn stubbles ranked in line, With lust of battle and with lust of play Made glorious drunk as men are drunk with wine. There go the coveys, forward birds and strong, Bound for the mangold where they wheel and stop. Now, steady, men, and bring the left along. A fortune waits us in each turnip-top. With a wild shriek, and then a whirr of wings, The covey rises. Brace and brace they drop, Joining the dead ranks of forgotten things In glorious death, the fierce delight of kings. OCTOBER GAMBLING AT MONACO A jewelled kingdom set impregnable In gardens green which front the violet sea, A happy fortress shut and guarded well, And cradled ever on the mountain's knee: Here Monsieur Blanc, sad prince of industry, Has reared the palace which men call his hell: And here in autumn days, when winds blow free, Pleasure shall lead us to sin's citadel. Alas for vice! Yet, who dares moralize, In the hushed rooms, where fortune reigns alway? Her solemn priest, with chink of coin, replies “Messieurs, faites votre jeu. Le jeu est fait.” Who dares be wise, lest wisdom's self be vexed? For all who come to preach remain to play. Nay, leave poor vice, say I, her pleasant text, Nor grudge her Heaven in this world with the next. NOVEMBER ACROSS COUNTRY November's here. Once more the pink we don, And on old Centaur, at the coverside, Sit changing pleasant greetings one by one With friend and neighbour. Half the county's pride Is here to-day. Squire, parson, peer, bestride Their stoutest nags, impatient to be gone. Here, schoolboys on their earliest ponies ride, And village lads on asses, not out-done. But hark! That sounds like music. Ay, by God! He's off across the fallow. “No, sirs, no; “Not yet a minute, just another rod! “Then let him have it. Ho, there, tallyho!” Now that's worth seeing! Look! He's topped the wall, Leaving his whole field pounded in a row. A first flight place to-day was worth a fall. So forward each, and Heaven for us all! DECEMBER AWAY TO EGYPT Enough, enough! This winter is too rude, Too dark of countenance, of tooth too keen. Nature finds rebels now in flesh and blood, And hearts grow sick for change and eyes for green. Let us away! What profits it that men Are wise as gods, if winter holds its sway, If blood be chilled, and numbness clasp the brain? Frost is too stubborn. Let us then away! Away to Egypt! There we may forget All but the presence of the blessed sun. There in our tents well-housed, sublimely set Under a pyramid, with horse and gun, We may make terms with Nature and, awhile, Put as it were our souls to grass, and run Barefooted and barehearted in the smile Of that long summer which still girds the Nile. GRISELDA A SOCIETY NOVEL IN RHYMED VERSE CHAPTER I An idle story with an idle moral! Why do I tell it, at the risk of quarrel With nobler themes? The world, alas! is so, And who would gather truth must bend him low, Nor fear to soil his knees with graveyard ground, If haply there some flower of truth be found. For human nature is an earthy fruit, Mired at the stem and fleshy at the root, And thrives with folly's mixon best o'erlaid, Nor less divinely so, when all is said. Brave lives are lived, and worthy deeds are done Each virtuous day, 'neath the all-pitying sun; But these are not the most, perhaps not even The surest road to our soul's modern Heaven. The best of us are creatures of God's chance (Call it His grace), which works deliverance; The rest mere pendulums 'twixt good and ill, Like soldiers marking time while standing still. 'Tis all their strategy, who have lost faith In things Divine beyond Man's life and death, Pleasure and pain. Of Heaven what know we Save as unfit for angels' company, Say rather Hell's? We cling to sins confessed, And say our prayers still hoping for the best. We fear old age and ugliness and pain, And love our lives, nor look to live again. I do but parable the crowd I know, The human cattle grazing as they go, Unheedful of the heavens. Here and there Some prouder, may be, or less hungry steer Lifting his face an instant to the sky, And left behind as the bent herd goes by, Or stung to a short madness, tossing wild His horns aloft, and charging the gay field, Till the fence stops him, and he vanquished too, Turns to his browsing—lost his Waterloo. The moral of my tale I leave to others More bold, who point the finger at their brothers, And surer know than I which way is best To virtue's goal, where all of us find rest, Whether in stern denial of things sweet, Or yielding timely, lest life lose its feet And fall the further. A plain tale is mine Of naked fact, unconscious of design, Told of the world in this last century Of Man's (not God's) disgrace, the XIXth. We Have made it all a little as it is In our own images and likenesses, And need the more forgiveness for our sin. Therefore, my Muse, impatient to begin, I bid thee fearless forward on thy road. Steer thou thy honest course 'twixt bad and good: Know this, in art that thing alone is evil Which shuns the one plain word that shames the Devil. Tell truth without preamble or excuse, And all shall be forgiven thee—all, my Muse! In London then not many years ago There lived a lady of high fashion, who For her friends' sake, if any still there be Who hold her virtues green in memory, Shall not be further named in this true tale Than as Griselda or the Lady L. Such, if I err not, was the second name Her parents gave when to the font she came, And such the initial letter bravely set On her coach door, beneath the coronet Which bore her and her fortunes—bore, alas! For, as in this sad world all things must pass, However great and nobly framed and fair: Griselda, too, is of the things that were. But while she lived Griselda had no need Of the world's pity. She was proudly bred And proudly nurtured. Plenty her full horn Had fairly emptied out when she was born, And dowered her with all bounties. She was fair As only children of the noblest are, And brave and strong and opulent of health, Which made her take full pleasure of her wealth. She had a pitying scorn of little souls And little bodies, levying heavy tolls On all the world which was less strong than she. She used her natural strength most naturally, And yet with due discretion, so that all Stood equally in bondage to her thrall. She was of that high godlike shape and size Which has authority in all men's eyes: Her hair was brown, her colour white and red, Nor idly moved to blush. She held her head Straight with her back. Her body, from the knee Tall and clean shaped, like some well-nurtured tree, Rose finely finished to the finger tips. She had a noble carriage of the hips, And that proportionate waist which only art Dares to divine, harmonious part with part. But of this more anon, or rather never. All that the world could vaunt for its endeavour Was the fair promise of her ankles set Upon a pair of small high-instepped feet, In whose behalf, though modestly, God wot, As any nun, she raised her petticoat One little inch more high than reason meet Was for one crossing a well-besomed street. This was the only tribute she allowed To human folly and the envious crowd; Nor for my part would I be found her judge For her one weakness, nor appear to grudge What in myself, as surely in the rest, Bred strange sweet fancies such as feet suggest. We owe her all too much. This point apart, Griselda, modesty's own counterpart, Moved in the sphere of folly like a star, Aloof and bright and most particular. By girlish choice and whim of her first will She had espoused the amiable Lord L., A worthy nobleman, in high repute For wealth and virtue, and her kin to boot; A silent man, well mannered and well dressed, Courteous, deliberate, kind, sublimely blessed With fortune's favours, but without pretence, Whom manners almost made a man of sense. In early life he had aspired to fame In the world of letters by the stratagem Of a new issue, from his private press, Of classic bards in senatorial dress, “In usum Marchionis.” He had spent Much of his youth upon the Continent, Purchasing marbles, bronzes, pictures, gems, In every town from Tiber unto Thames, And gaining store of curious knowledge too On divers subjects that the world least knew: Knowledge uncatalogued, and overlaid With dust and lumber somewhere in his head. A slumberous man, in whom the lamp of life Had never quite been lighted for the strife And turmoil of the world, but flickered down, In an uncertain twilight of its own, With an occasional flash, that only made A deeper shadow for its world of shade. When he returned to England, all admired The taste of his collections, and inquired To whose fair fortunate head the lot should fall To wear these gems and jewels after all. But years went by, and still unclaimed they shone, A snare and stumbling-block to more than one, Till in his fiftieth year 'twas vaguely said, Lord L. already had too long delayed. Be it as it may, he abdicated life The day he took Griselda to his wife. And then Griselda loved him. All agreed, The world's chief sponsors for its social creed, That, whether poor Lord L. was or was not The very fool some said and idiot, Or whether under cloak of dulness crass, He veiled that sense best suited to his case, Sparing his wit, as housewives spare their light, For curtain eloquence and dead of night; And spite of whispered tales obscurely spread, Doubting the fortunes of her nuptial bed, Here at this word all sides agreed to rest: Griselda did her duty with the best. Yet, poor Griselda! When in lusty youth A love-sick boy I stood unformed, uncouth, And watched with sad and ever jealous eye The vision of your beauty passing by, Why was it that that brow inviolate, That virginal courage yet unscared by fate, That look the immortal queen and huntress wore To frightened shepherds' eyes in days of yore Consoled me thus, and soothed unconsciously, And stilled my jealous fears I knew not why? How shall I tell the secret of your soul Which then I blindly guessed, or how cajole My boyhood's ancient folly to declare Now in my wisdom the dear maid you were, Though such the truth? Griselda's early days Of married life were not that fitful maze Of tears and laughter which betoken aught, Changed or exchanged, of pain with pleasure bought, Of maiden freedom conquered and subdued, Of hopes new born and fears of womanhood. Those who then saw Griselda saw a child Well pleased and happy, thoughtlessly beguiled By every simplest pleasure of her age, Gay as a bird just issued from its cage, When every flower is sweet. No eye could trace Doubt or disquiet written on her face, Where none there was. And, if the truth be told, Griselda grieved not that Lord L. was old. She found it well that her sweet seventeen Should live at peace with fifty, and was seen Just as she felt, contented with her lot, Pleased with what was and pleased with what was not She held her husband the more dear that he Was kind within the bounds of courtesy, And love was not as yet within her plan, And life was fair, and wisdom led the van. For she was wise—oh, wise! She rose at eight And played her scales till breakfast, and then sat The morning through with staid and serious looks, Counting the columns of her household books, Her daily labour, or with puzzled head Bent over languages alive and dead, Wise as alas! in life those only are Who have not yet beheld a twentieth year. Wealth had its duties, time its proper use, Youth and her marriage should be no excuse; Her education must be made complete! Lord L. looked on and quite approved of it. The afternoons, in sense of duty done, Went by more idly than the rest had gone. If in the country, which Lord L. preferred, She had her horse, her dogs, her favourite bird, Her own rose-garden, which she loved to rake, Her fish to feed with bread crumbs in the lake, Her schools, old women, poor and almshouses, Her sick to visit, or her church to dress. Lord L. was pleased to see her bountiful: They hardly found the time to find it dull. In London, where they spent their second year, Came occupations suited to the sphere In which they lived; and to the just pretence Of our Griselda's high-born consequence, New duties to the world which no excuse Admitted. She was mistress of L. House And heir to its traditions. These must be Observed by her in due solemnity. Her natural taste, I think, repelled the noise, The rush, and dust, and crush of London joys; But habit, which becomes a second sense, Had reconciled her to its influence Even in girlhood, and she long had known That life in crowds may still be life alone, While mere timidity and want of ease She never ranked among youth's miseries. She had her parents too, who made demand Upon her thoughts and time, and close at hand Sisters and friends. With these her days were spent In simple joys and girlish merriment. She would not own that being called a wife Should make a difference in her daily life. Then London lacks not of attractions fit For serious minds, and treasures infinite Of art and science for ingenious eyes, And learning for such wits as would be wise, Lectures in classes, galleries, schools of art: In each Griselda played conspicuous part— Pupil and patron, ay, and patron-saint To no few poor who live by pens and paint. The world admired and flattered as a friend, And only wondered what would be the end. And so the days went by. Griselda's face, Calm in its outline, of romantic grace, Became a type even to the vulgar mind Of all that beauty means when most refined, The visible symbol of a soul within, Conceived immaculate of human sin, And only clothed in our humanity That we may learn to praise and better be. Where'er she went, instinctively the crowd Made way before her, and ungrudging bowed To one so fair as to a Queen of Earth, Ruling by right of conquest and of birth. And thus I first beheld her, standing calm In the swayed crowd upon her husband's arm, One opera night, the centre of all eyes, So proud she seemed, so fair, so sweet, so wise. Some one behind me whispered “Lady L.! His Lordship too! and thereby hangs a tale.” His Lordship! I beheld a placid man, With gentle deep-set eyes, and rather wan, And rather withered, yet on whose smooth face Time seemed to have been in doubt what lines to trace Of youth or age, and so had left it bare, As it had left its colour to his hair. An old young man perhaps, or really old, Which of the two could never quite be told. I judged him younger than his years gave right, His looks betrayed him least by candlelight. Yet, young or old, that night he seemed to me Sublime, the priest of her divinity At whose new shrine I worshipped. But enough Of me and my concerns! More pertinent stuff My tale requires than this first boyish love, Which never found the hour its fate to prove. My Lady smiling motions with her hand; The crowd falls back; his Lordship, gravely bland, Leads down the steps to where his footmen stay In state. Griselda's carriage stops the way! And was Griselda happy? Happy?—Yes, In her first year of marriage, and no less Perhaps, too, in her second and her third. For youth is proud, nor cares its last sad word To ask of fate, and not unwilling clings To what the present hour in triumph brings. It was enough, as I have said, for her That she was young and fortunate and fair. The world that loved her was a lovely world, The rest she knew not of. Fate had not hurled A single spear as yet against her life. She would not argue as 'twixt maid and wife, Where both were Woman, Human Nature, Man, Which held the nobler place in the world's plan. Her soul at least was single, and must be Unmated still through its eternity. And, even here in life, what reason yet To doubt or question or despair of Fate? Her youth, an ample web, before her shone For hope to weave its subtlest fancies on, If she had cared to dream. Her lot was good Beyond the common lot of womanhood, And she would prove her fortune best in this, That she would not repine at happiness. Thus to her soul she argued as the Spring Brought back its joy to each begotten thing— Begotten and begetting. Who shall say Which had the better reason, she or they? In the fourth year a half acknowledged grief Made its appearance in Griselda's life. Her sisters married, younger both than she, Mere children she had thought, and happily. Each went her way engrossed by her new bliss, Too gay to guess Griselda's dumb distress. Her home was broken. In their pride they wrote Things that like swords against her bosom smote, The detail of their hopes, and loves, and fears. Griselda read, and scarce restrained her tears. Her mother too, the latest fledgling flown, Had vanished from the world. She was alone. When she returned to London, earlier Than was her custom, in the following year, She found her home a desert, dark and gaunt; L. House looked emptier, gloomier than its wont. Griselda sighed, for on the table lay Two letters, which announced each in its way The expected tidings of her sisters' joy. Either was brought to bed—and with a boy. Her generous heart leaped forth to these in vain, It could not cheat a first sharp touch of pain, But yielded to its sorrow. That same night, Lord L., whose sleep was neither vexed nor light, And who for many years had ceased to dream, Beheld a vision. Slowly he became Aware of a strange light which in his eyes Shone to his vast discomfort and surprise; And, while perplexed with vague mistrusts and fears, He saw a face, Griselda's face, in tears Before him. She was standing by his bed Holding a candle. It was cold, she said, And shivered. And he saw her wrap her shawl About her shoulders closely like a pall. Why was she there? Why weeping? Why this light, Burning so brightly in the dead of night? These riddles poor Lord L.'s half-wakened brain Tried dimly to resolve, but tried in vain. “I cannot sleep to-night,” went on the voice, “The streets disturb me strangely with their noise, The cabs, the striking clocks.” Lord L.'s distress Struggled with sleep. He thought he answered “Yes.” “What can I do to make me sleep? I am ill, Unnerv'd to-night. This house is like a well. Do I disturb you here, and shall I go?” Lord L. was moved. He thought he answered “No.” “If you would speak, perhaps my tears would stop. Speak! only speak!” Lord L. here felt a drop Upon his hand. She had put down the light, And sat upon his bed forlornly white And pale and trembling. Her dark hair unbound Lay on her knees. Her lips moved, but their sound Came strangely to his ears and half-unheard. He only could remember the last word: “I am unhappy—listen L.!—alone.” She touched his shoulder and he gave a groan. “This is too much. You do not hear me. See, I cannot stop these tears. Too much!” And he Now well awake, looked round him. He could catch A gleam of light just vanished, and the latch Seemed hardly silent. This was all he knew. He sat some moments doubting what to do, Rose, went out, shivered, hearing nothing, crept Back to his pillow where the vision wept Or seemed to weep awhile ago, and then With some disquiet went to sleep again. Next morning, thinking of his dream, Lord L. Went down to breakfast in intent to tell The story of his vision. But he met With little sympathy. His wife was late, And in a hurry for her school of art. His lordship needed time to make a start On any topic, and no time she gave. Griselda had appointments she must save, And could not stop to hear of rhyme or reason— The dream must wait a more convenient season. And so it was not told. Alas, alas! Who shall foretell what wars shall come to pass, What woes be wrought, what fates accomplishèd, What new dreams dreamt, what new tears vainly shed, What doubts, what anguish, what remorse, what fears Begotten in the womb of what new years!— And all because of this, that poor Lord L. Was slow of speech, or that he slept too well! CHAPTER II Thus then it was. Griselda's childhood ends With this untoward night; and what portends May only now be guessed by those who read Signs on the earth and wonders overhead. I dare not prophesy. What next appears In the vain record of Griselda's years Is hardly yet a token, for her life Shewed little outward sign of change or strife, Though she was changed and though perhaps at war. Her face still shone untroubled as a star In the world's firmament, and still she moved, A creature to be wondered at and loved. Her zeal, her wit, her talents, her good sense Were all unchanged, though each seemed more intense And lit up with new passion and inspired To active purpose, valiant and untired. She faced the world, talked much and well, made friends, Promoted divers schemes for divers ends, Artistic, social, philanthropical: She had a store of zeal for each and all. She pensioned poets, nobly took in hand An emigration plan to Newfoundland, Which ended in disaster and a ball. She visited St. George's hospital, The Home for Fallen Women, founded schools Of music taught on transcendental rules. L. House was dull though splendid. She had schemes Of a vast London palace on the Thames, Which should combine all orders new and old Of architectural taste a house could hold, And educate the masses. Then one day, She fairly wearied and her soul gave way. Again she sought Lord L., but not to ask This time his counsel in the thankless task She could no more make good, the task of living. He was too mere a stranger to her grieving, Her needs, her weakness. All her woman's heart Was in rebellion at the idle part He played in her sad life, and needed not Mere pity for a pain to madness wrought. She did not ask his sympathy. She said Only that she was weary as the dead, And needed change of air, and life, and scene: She wished to go where all the world had been— To Paris, Florence, Rome. She could not die And not have seen the Alps and Italy. Lord L. had tried all Europe, and knew best Where she could flee her troubles and find rest. Such was her will. Lord L., without more goad, Prepared for travel—and they went abroad. I will not follow here from day to day Griselda's steps. Suffice it if I say She found her wished-for Paris wearisome, Another London and without her home, And so went on, as still the fashion was, Some years ago, ere Pullman cars with gas And quick night flittings had submerged mankind In one mad dream of luggage left behind, By the Rhone boat to Provence. This to her Seemed a delicious land, strange, barren, fair, An old-world wilderness of greys and browns, Rocks, olive-gardens, grim dismantled towns, Deep-streeted, desolate, yet dear to see, Smelling of oil and of the Papacy. Griselda first gave reins to her romance In this forgotten corner of old France, Feeding her soul on that ethereal food, The manna of days spent in solitude. Lord L. was silent. She, as far away, Saw other worlds which were not of to-day, With cardinals, popes, Petrarch and the Muse. She stopped to weep with Laura at Vaucluse, Where waiting in the mistral poor Lord L., Who did not weep, sat, slept and caught a chill; This sent them southwards on through Christendom, To Genoa, Florence, and at last to Rome, Where they remained the winter. Change had wrought A cure already in Griselda's thought, Or half a cure. The world in truth is wide, If we but pace it out from side to side, And our worst miseries thus the smaller come. Griselda was ashamed to grieve in Rome, Among the buried griefs of centuries, Her own sweet soul's too pitiful disease. She found amid that dust of human hopes An incantation for all horoscopes, A better patience in that wreck of Time: Her secret woes seemed chastened and sublime There in the amphitheatre of woe. She suffered with the martyrs. These would know, Who offered their chaste lives and virgin blood, How mortal frailty best might be subdued. She saw the incense of her sorrow rise With theirs as an accepted sacrifice Before the face of the Eternal God Of that Eternal City, and she trod The very stones which seemed their griefs to sound Beneath her steps, as consecrated ground. In face of such a suffering hers must be A drop, a tear in the unbounded sea Which girds our lives. Rome was the home of grief, Where all might bring their pain and find relief, The temple of all sorrows: surely yet, Sorrow's self here seemed swallowed up in it. 'Twas thus she comforted her soul. And then, She had found a friend, a phœnix among men, Which made it easier to compound with life, Easier to be a woman and a wife. This was Prince Belgirate. He of all The noble band to whose high fortune fall The name and title proudest upon Earth While pride shall live by privilege of birth, The name of Roman, shone conspicuous The head and front of his illustrious house, Which had produced two pontiffs and a saint Before the world had heard of Charles le Quint; A most accomplished nobleman in truth, And wise beyond the manner of his youth, With wit and art and learning, and that sense Of policy which still is most intense Among the fertile brains of Italy, A craft inherited from days gone by. As scholar he was known the pupil apt Of Mezzofanti, in whose learning lapped And prized and tutored as a wondrous child, He had sucked the milk of knowledge undefiled While yet a boy, and brilliantly anon Had pushed his reputation thus begun Through half a score of tongues. In art his place Was as chief patron of the rising race, Which dreamed new conquests on the glorious womb Of ancient beauty laid asleep in Rome. The glories of the past he fain would see Wrought to new life in this new century, By that continuous instinct of her sons, Which had survived Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Huns, To burst upon a wondering world again With full effulgence in the Julian reign. In politics, though prudently withdrawn From the public service, which he held in scorn, As being unworthy the deliberate zeal Of one with head to think or heart to feel; And being neither priest, nor soldier, nor Versed in the practice of Canonic lore, He made his counsels felt and privately Lent his best influence to “the Powers that be,” Counsels the better valued that he stood Alone, among the youth of stirring blood, And bowed not to that Baal his proud knee, The national false goddess, Italy. He was too stubborn in his Roman pride To trick out this young strumpet as a bride, And held in classic scorn who would become Less than a Roman citizen in Rome. A man of heart besides and that light wit Which leavens all, even pedantry's conceit. None better knew than he the art to shew A little less in talk than all he knew. His manner too, and voice, and countenance, Imposed on all, and these he knew to enhance By certain freedoms and simplicities Of language, which set all his world at ease. A very peer and prince and paragon, Griselda thought, Rome's latest, worthiest son, An intellectual phœnix. On her night A sudden dawn had broke, portentous, bright. Her soul had found its fellow. From the day Of their first meeting on the Appian Way, Beside Metella's tomb, where they had discussed The doubtful merit of a new found bust, And had agreed to differ or agree, I know not which, a hidden sympathy Had taken root between them. Either mind Found in the other tokens of its kind Which spoke in more than words, and naturally Leaned to its fellow-mind as tree to tree. Lord L., who had known the Prince in other days, While riding home had spoken in his praise, And won Griselda's heart and patient smile, For divers threadbare tales of blameless guile Among the virtuosi, where the prince Had played his part with skill and influence, His sworn ally. Lord L. grew eloquent, Finding her ears such rapt attention lent, And could have gone on talking all his life About his friend's perfections to his wife. Griselda listened. In her heart there stirred A strange unconscious pleasure at each word, Which made the sunshine brighter and the sky More blue, more tender in its sympathy. The hills of the Campagna crowned with snow Moved her and touched, she knew not why nor how. The solemn beauty of the world; the fate Of all things living, vast and inchoate Yet clothed with flowers; the soul's eternal dream Of something still beyond; the passionate whim Of every noble mind for something good, Which should assuage its hunger with new food; The thrill of hope, the pulse of happiness, The vague half-conscious longing of the eyes: All these appealed to her, and seemed to lie In form and substance under the blue sky, Filling the shadows of the Sabine Hills As with a presence, till her natural ills, Transfigured through a happy mist of tears, Gave place to hopes yet hardly dreamed as hers. And still Lord L. talked calmly on, and she Listened as to the voice of prophecy, Nursing the pressure which the Prince's hand Had left in hers, nor cared to understand. From this day forth, I say, a tender mood Possessed them both scarce conscious and unwooed, Even in the Prince, her elder and a man. At least Griselda had no thought nor plan Beyond the pleasure of a friendship dear To all alike, Lord L., the Prince, and her: No plan but that the day would be more sweet, More full of meaning, if they chanced to meet; And this chanced every day. The Prince was kind Beyond all kindness, and Lord L. could find No words to speak his thanks he thus should be The cicerone of their company. And where a better? Belgirate's lore In all things Roman was in truth a store From which to steal. At her Gamaliel's knees Griselda sat and learned Rome's mysteries With all the zeal of a disciple young And strange to genius and a pleading tongue. The Prince was eloquent. His theme was high, One which had taught less vigorous wings to fly, The world of other days, the Pagan Rome, The scarce less Pagan Rome of Christendom. On these the Prince spoke warmly much and well, Holding Griselda's patient ears in spell, Yet broke off smiling when he met her eye Fixed on his face in its mute sympathy, A smile which was a question, an appeal, And seemed to ask the meaning of her zeal. He did not understand her quite. He saw Something beyond, unfixed by any law Of woman's nature his experience knew. He knew not what to hold or hope as true, For she was young and sad and beautiful, A very woman with a woman's soul. She had so strange a pathos in her eyes, A tone so deep, such echoes in her voice. What was this Roman Hecuba to her? This prate of consul, pontiff, emperor? These broken symbols of forgotten pride? These ashes of old fame by fame denied? What were these stones to her that she should weep, Or spend her passion on a cause less deep Than her own joys and sorrows? Was it love, Or what thing else had such a power to move? If there was meaning in red lips! And yet 'Twere rank impiety to think of it. An Italian woman—yes. But she? Who knew What English virtue dared yet dared not do? This was the thought which lent its mockery To the more tender omen of his eye, And checked the pride and chilled the vague desire Her beauty half had kindled into fire. Yet hope was born and struggled to more life, A puny infant with its fears at strife, An unacknowledged hidden bastard child, Too fair to crush, too wise to be beguiled; Even Griselda's prudery confessed A star of Bethlehem risen in her East. And thus the winter passed in happiness If not in love. I leave to each to guess What name 'twere best to give it. For to some Who judge such things by simple rule of thumb, 'Twill seem impossible they thus should meet Day after day in palace, temple, street, Beneath the sun of heaven or in the shade Of those old gardens by the cypress made, Or on their horses drinking in the wind Of the Campagna, and with care behind, Left to take vengeance upon poor Lord L., Some furlongs back a solemn sentinel, Or in the twilight slowly stealing home Towards the hundred cupolas of Rome, To greet the new-born moon and so repeat Old Tuscan ditties, tender, wise, and sweet, To the light chatter of their horse-hoofs' chime In echoing answer of their terza-rhyme— 'Twil seem, I say, to some impossible That all this was not love. Yet, sooth to tell, Easter had come and gone, and yet 'twas true No word of love had passed between the two. The fact is, after the first halcyon hour When she had met the Prince and proved his power To move her inmost soul, Griselda made This compact with her heart no less than head, Being a woman of much logic sense, And knowing all, at least by inference. She was resolved that, come what evil might On her poor heart, the right should still be right, And not a hair's breadth would she swerve from this, Though it should cost her soul its happiness. She would not trifle longer, nor provide The Prince with pretext for his further pride, Or grant more favour than a friendship given Once and for all, in this world as in Heaven. This she indeed could offer, but, if more Were asked, why then, alas! her dream was o'er. I think no actual covenant had passed In words between them either first or last, But that the Prince, though puzzled and perplexed, Had drawn a just conclusion from his text, And read her meaning, while the hazard made, Of certain idle words at random said, Had sapped his confidence, and served to show If speech were wise, 'twas wiser to forgo. Once too he wrote a sonnet. They had spent An afternoon (it was in early Lent) At that fair angle of the city wall Which is the English place of burial, A poet's pilgrimage to Shelley's tomb, The holiest spot, Griselda thought, in Rome, A place to worship in, perhaps to pray, At least to meditate and spend the day. She had brought her friend with her. She had at heart To win his homage for the unknown art Of this dead alien priest of Italy, This lover of the earth, and sea, and sky; And, reading there and talking in that mood Which comes of happiness and youthful blood So near akin to sorrow, their discourse Had touched on human pain and pain's remorse Amid the eternal greenness of the Spring; And, when they came to part, there had seemed to ring A note of trouble in Griselda's voice, A sigh as if in grief for human joys, An echo of unspoken tenderness, Which caused the Prince to hold her hand in his One little moment longer than was right, When they had shaken hands and bid good-night. And so he wrote that evening on the spur Of the first tender impulse of the hour A sonnet to Griselda, a farewell It seemed to be, yet also an appeal, Perhaps a declaration; who shall say Whether the thought which lightened into day, Between the sorrowing accents of each line, Was more despair, or hope which asked a sign? “Farewell,” it said, “although nor seas divide Nor kingdoms separate, but a single street, The sole sad gap between us, scarce too wide For hands to cross, and though we needs must meet Not in a year, a month, but just to-morrow, When the first happy instinct of our feet Bears us together,—yet we part in sorrow, Bidding good-bye, as though we would repeat Good-byes for ever. There are gulfs that yawn Between us wide with time and circumstance, Deep as the gulf which lies 'twixt dead and dead. The day of promise finds no second dawn. See, while I speak, the pressure of our hands Fades slowly from remembrance, and is fled, And our weak hearts accept their fate. Nay, nay, We meet again, but never as to-day.” To this Griselda answered nothing. She Was pleased, yet disconcerted. Poetry Is always pleasant to a woman's ear, And to Griselda's had been doubly dear, If it had touched less nearly. But her heart Had bounded with too violent a start To leave her certain of her self-control, In this new joy which seemed to probe her soul. And feeling frightened she had tried to find A reason for the tumult of her mind In being angry. He should not have dared To strike so near the truth. Or had she bared Her soul so plain to his that he should speakOf both as an eye-witness? She felt weak And out of temper with herself and him, And with the sudden waking from a dream Too long indulged, and with her own sad fate, Which made all dreams a crime against the State. There yawned indeed a gulf between them. This It needed no such word as had been his To bring back to her memory or show How wide it was, and deep, and far below; And yet she shuddered, for already thought Had led her to the brink where reason fought With folly, and conjured it to look down Into the vast and terrible unknown. This was itself an omen. All that day Griselda had a headache, and said nay To those who called, the Prince among the rest, Who came distrusting and returned distressed. Awhile this humour lasted. Then they met, And Belgirate, venturing a regret For having vexed her with so poor a rhyme, Griselda had protested want of time And want of talent as her sole excuse For having made no answer to his Muse, Yet cast withal a look so pitiful Upon his face it moved his very soul. This closed the incident. He might have spoken Perhaps that instant, and received some token Of more than a forgiveness. But his fate Had willed it otherwise or willed too late, For love forgives not, plead it as we may To speak the unspoken “Yes” of yesterday. CHAPTER III Who has not seen the falls of Tivoli, The rocks, the foam-white water, and the three Fair ruined temples which adorn the hill? Who has not sat and listened to the shrill Sweet melody of blackbirds, and the roar Of Anio's voice rebounding from the shore, Nor would have given his very soul to greet Some passing vision of a white nymph's feet, And waving arms, as the wild chasm's spray Beat on his face, for ever answering “Nay”? Who has not turned away with sadder face, Abashed before the genius of the place, A wiser man, and owned upon his knees, The dull transmontane Goth and boor he is? Who that was born to feel? What sons of clay Are these that stand among your shrines to-day, Gods of the ancient rivers! and who set The heavy impress of barbarian feet Upon your classic shores, and dare to love Your ruined homes in temple, rock, and grove! What new rude sons of Japhet! What mad crew, Whose only creed is what it dares to do Through lack of knowledge, whose undoubting heart, Here in the very temples of old art, Brings out its little tribute, builds its shrines, Wreathes its sad garlands of untutored lines, Writes, paints, professes, sculptures its new gods, And dares to have its home in your abodes! Oh, if I had a soul oppressed with song, A tongue on fire to prophesy among My brother prophets, if I had a hand Which needs must write its legend on life's sand With brush or chisel, I at least would choose Some soil less fair, less sacred to the Muse, Some younger, wilder land, where no sad voice Had ever stammered forth its tale of joys And loves and sorrows, or in tones less rude Than the brute pulsing of its human blood; If I would build a temple, it should be At least not here, not here in Italy, Where all these temples stand. My thought should shape Its fancies in rough granite on some cape O'erlooking the Atlantic, from whose foam No goddess ever leaped, and not in Rome, Beneath the mockery of immortal eyes, Gazing in marble down, so coldly wise! Such was Griselda's thought, which, half aloud, She uttered one May morning 'mid a crowd Of pleasure-seekers, come from Rome to see The wonder of these falls of Tivoli, And Belgirate's villa, where the Prince Was offering entertainment (for his sins), And dancing, to all such as called him friend That Spring in Rome, now nearly at an end;— A thought suggested by the place and by A German painter, who undauntedly Was plying a huge canvas just begun, With brush and palette seated in the sun. She had hardly meant to speak, and when Lord L. Objected (for he knew his classics well) That landscape-painting was an unknown trade In the days of Horace, blushed for her tirade, And turned to Belgirate, who stood near, Playing the host to all the world and her. The Prince appealed to, though his care was less With what was spoken than the speaker's face, Took up the parable, confessed the truth Of all each ventured, and agreed with both. Nature, he said, and art, though now allied, Had not in all times thus walked side by side. Indeed the love of Nature, now so real, Was alien to the love of the ideal, The classic love which claimed as though of need Some living presence for each fountain-head, Each grove, each cavern, satyr, nymph, or god, A human shape unseen yet understood. This was the thought which lived in ancient art, Eschewing the waste places of the heart, And only on compulsion brought to face Brute Nature's aspect in its nakedness. Nature as Nature was a thought too rude For these, untempered in its solitude. It had no counterpart in our new love Of mountain, sea, and forest. Then each grove Asked for its statue, each perennial spring Its fountain. Solitude itself must bring Its echo. Every mountain top of Greece Beheld fair temples rise. A law of peace Reigned over art in protest at the mood Of social life which drenched the world in blood. All now had been reversed. Our modern creed Scouted the law that men were born to bleed. It turned from human nature, if untaught, And wrought mankind, perhaps and overwrought Into trim shapes, and then for its relief Rushed to the wilderness to vent its grief In lonely passion. Here it neither sought Nor found a presence which it needed not. It chose wild hills and barren seas. It saw Beauty in tumult, in revolt a law. Here it gave reins to its brute instincts. Here It owned no god, no guide, no arbiter. Its soul it must avenge of discipline, And Nature had gone naked from the shrine. This was its consolation. Of the score Who stood around him and who praised his lore, Perhaps no single listener understood The thought which underlay the Prince's mood, Or guessed its bitterness—not even she Who lent the moral to his mockery. Yet she was moved. In her too was a need Of consolation for too fair a creed, An impulse of rebellion. In her blood There lived a germ of Nature unsubdued, Which would not be appeased. She too had sought A refuge from the tyranny of thought In the brute impulses of sea and plain And cloud and forest far from haunts of men. A vain mad search. The fetters of her pride Galled her like sores. Griselda turned and sighed. That evening on the terrace, vaguely lit With paper lanterns and the infinite Display of those fair natural lamps, the stars, And 'neath the influence of the planet Mars Or Venus or another—which it was We best may judge by that which came to pass— The Prince essayed his fortune. From the hour Of their first flash of eloquence, some power, Some most persistent and ingenious fate Of idle tongues had held them separate, Griselda and the Prince—him in his part Of host, with cares not wholly of the heart Demanding his attention, while on her Friends fastened more than dull and less than dear. In vain they stopped, and loitered, and went on, Leaving no trick untried, unturned no stone; In vain they waited. Still the hope deferred Failed of its object, one consoling word, One little sigh as of relief thus given: “Well, they are gone at last, and thanked be Heaven.” But hour on hour went by, and accident Seemed still at pains to frustrate their intent, Piling up grief for them and poor Lord L., On whom, in fault of foes, their vengeance fell. 'Twas worst for her. She knew not whom to strike, Lord L., her friends, the Prince? 'Twas now alike. She had lost in fact her temper, if I dare Thus speak of one so wise and one so fair, And to the point that now there was no room For other thought, but L. should take her home, Away and speedily. The Prince, who knew No word of what a storm Fate held in brew, And who had sought, in innocence of all, Griselda's hand to lead the opening ball, And sought in vain, now found, to his despair, My lady cloaked and standing on the stair. She was alone. “Lord L. had gone,” she said, “To bid the Prince good night. Her foolish head Had played her false, and ached with the new heat Of the May sun (even L. complained of it). They must be home betimes. Next day was Sunday, And they had much to do 'twixt that and Monday, In view of their departure.” “Whither? whence? In Heaven's name,” exclaimed the astounded Prince. “Why, home to England, she had thought he knew: She must have told him. L. was more than due In London, where his place in Parliament Required his presence. He had missed the Lent, And dared not miss the Easter session. She Thought he was right, altho',” and suddenly She burst in tears. The Prince, in dire distress, Besought her to be calm. But she, with face Hid in both hands, and turning from the light, Broke from his arms, and rushed into the night. Across the hall, beneath the portico, And down the steps she fled, to where below The garden lay all dim with starlit shade, And the white glimmer of the main facade. Here Belgirate found her on a seat, Crouched in an angle of the parapet, And sobbing as in terror. His surprise Was changed to resolution. To his eyes The world became transfigured. “Lady L.,” He whispered, “what is this? You love me? Well, Why do you weep?” He took her hands in his And pressed them to his lips; and at the kiss Griselda started from the heap she was And sat upright, with pale pathetic face Turned to the night. By the dim starlight he Beheld, half-awed and half in ecstasy, The strange emotion of her countenance. She made no gesture to withdraw her hands, No sign of disagreement with his words. Her eyes looked scared and troubled like a bird's Caught in a net, and seemed to ask of Fate Where the next blow should fall. 'Twas thus she sat Speechless, inanimate, nor seemed to breathe. The Prince could hear the chattering of her teeth, And feel her shiver in the warm night wind, And yet its touch was hardly thus unkind. He too, poor soul, in hope and tenderness, Still kissed her hands, and kissed her gloves and dress, And kneeling at her feet embraced her knees With soothing arms and soft cajoleries. She dared not turn nor speak. The balustrade Served as a pretext for her with its shade Hiding his face. She would not seem to guess All that his fondness asked of her distress: A word might break the spell. She only knew She was a poor sad woman, doomed to do Sorrow to all who loved her, that the Prince Had spoken truly, and her long pretence Of innocence was o'er. She scorned to make An idle protest now for honour's sake. He had a right to ask for what he would Now that she loved him, and her womanhood Reserved one tearful right, and only one, To hide her face an instant and be gone. How long they sat thus silent who shall say? Griselda knew not. Time was far away; She wanted courage to prepare her heart For that last bitterest word of all, “We part.” And he cared naught for time. His Heaven was there, Nor needed thought, nor speech, nor even prayer. A sound of music roused them. From the house Voices broke in and strains tumultuous, Proving the dance begun. Then with a sigh Griselda turned her head, and piteously Looked in his face. She moved as if to go, And when he held her still, “For pity, no, Let me be gone,” she cried. “I ask it thus,” Clasping her hands. “You will not? No! alas! You must not doubt me when I speak the truth; This is a great misfortune for us both.” “Griselda,” he began. “Oh, stop,” she said, “You know not what you ask.” She bent her head Close to his own. “I am not what I seem, A woman to be loved, not even by him Whom I might choose to worship. Mine must be An unfinished life, not quite a tragedy, Even to my friends, an idle aimless life, Not worth an argument, still less a strife. You must forget, forgive me. We were friends, Friends still perhaps; but, oh! this first day ends Our love for ever. What you said was true, Only I never guessed it.” The Prince knew That she was weeping, and a single sob Broke from her lips. She seemed her wounds to probe. “Yes, I have loved you, loved you from the first, The day we met at Terni, when you burst Like sunshine on the storm of my dark life— You, wise and free—I, only the sad wife Of one you called a friend. The fault was mine And mine alone. In you there was no sin: You stood too far from me, too high above My woman's follies even to dream of love. There, do not answer, you were kind to me, Good, patient, wise—you could no other be— But, oh! you never loved me.” Here again The Prince broke in protesting (but in vain): Her words were madness and his heart was hers. She would not listen nor control her tears. “You never loved me. This one thought I hold In consolation of my manifold Deceits and errors. You at least are free From all deceptions and remorse and me: I cannot cause you sorrow, else it were Indeed too pitiful, too hard to bear.” She stooped and kissed his forehead reverently, As one would kiss a relic; and when he Still would have spoken, stopped him with a hand Laid on his lips, half-prayer and half-command. She would not let him speak. The prince, tho' mute, Now pleaded with his hands and pressed his suit With better eloquence, for this to her Seemed less a crime than speech. Her ignorant fear Had hardly fathomed yet the troubled sea On which her lot was cast thus dangerously. She only feared his words to prove him right, And these caresses in the dim still night Soothed and consoled her. They were too unreal, Too strange to her experience, quite to feel Or quite to question. She, with half-shut eyes, And face averted, ceased to feel surprise, And ceased to think. She was a child again, Caressed and fondled. She forgot her pain, And almost even his presence in the place. He was too near and could not see her face. Besides, Griselda loved him. Only once She made a silent protest with her hands, As one might make asleep, and in her dream Opened her eyes, and seemed to question him With the pathetic instinct as of doom. The Prince in rapture judged his hour was come. Alas! poor Prince. If thou hadst had thy bliss, I would not then have grudged thy happiness, Thine nor Griselda's. Happiness is not A merchandise men buy or leave unbought And find again. It is a wild bird winging Its way through heaven, in joyous circles ringing, Aloft, at its own will. Then, ere we wist, It stooped and sat a moment on our wrist, And fondled with our fingers, and made play With jess and hood as if it meant to stay. And we, if we were wise and fortunate, And if the hour had been decreed of fate, Seized the glad bird and held it in our hand, And forced it to obey our least command, Knowing that never more, if not made sure, It would come again to voice, or sign, or lure. Oh, such is happiness. That night for them Fate stood, a genius, suppliant and tame, Demanding to do service. Had they willed, The treasure-house of Heaven had been unfilled And emptied in their lap. They too, even they, Mere mortals born, inheritors of clay, Had known eternal life, and been as gods. Only the will between them was at odds, Only the word was wanting. What one thing It was that frightened Fate to taking wing, And scared for ever the celestial bird, And left them desolate, if I have heard I do not now remember nor would say Even if I knew. 'Twas told me not to-day Nor yesterday, but in a time long since, By one of the two who knew, in confidence, And then not quite perhaps the utter truth. Whoever tells it? But there came to both A moment when, as Belgirate knew, There was no further power to plead or sue: They had played with Fate too long. Their hour was over; She was no more his love nor he her lover. His courage was exhausted. One by one His fingers, which still held Griselda's gown, Relaxed their hold. His hands dropped by his side, His head upon his bosom, and the pride, Which was the reason of his being, quailed. Grief in that hour and tenderness prevailed, And tears rushed to his eyes, long strangers there, And to his lips, Italian-like, a prayer, While he lay prostrate, his face turned from heaven, Under the stars. The tower clock struck eleven And roused him. He had neither heard nor known Griselda's going, but he was alone. And she? Griselda? In a whirl of grief, Tortured, distracted, hopeless of relief, And careless now what eye should see her tears, Whom none could mock with bitterer jibes than hers, And speechless to all question of her lord, Who sought to learn what portent had occurred, And still reverted to the theme begun Of Roman fever and the Roman sun; She was driven back to Rome. Two days her door Was shut to all the world, both rich and poor, And on the third she went to Ostia, Pleading a wild desire to see the sea. The sea! What virtue is there in the sea That it consoles us thus in misery? In joy we do not love it, and our bliss Scoffs at its tears and scorns its barrenness. Our pride of life is in the fruitful Earth, The mother of all joy, which gave us birth, The Earth so touching in its hopes to be, So green, so tender in its sympathy. But when life turns to bitterness—ah! then, Where is Earth's message to the sons of men? How does she speak? What sound of grief is hers To match our grief? What tale of pity stirs Her jubilant heart? The laughing woods give back Naught of their happiness to those who lack. The beauty of the uplands bars relief, The prosperous fields are insolent to grief; There is no comfort in the lowing herds, The hum of bees, the songs, the shouts of birds; There is no sob in all the living earth, Naught but the flutter of discordant mirth, On which, as on a pageant, morn and even The careless sun shines mockingly from heaven. There is no grief in all the world save one, The ocean's voice, as tearful as our own. Then from the Earth we turn—too potent mother, Too joyous in her offspring—to that other, The childless, joyless, unproductive sea, And mourn with her her dread virginity. We clasp her naked rocks with our two hands, Barefoot we tread her barren waste of sands, Her breadths of shingle and her treeless shore, Knowing her griefs are as our griefs, and more, An eternal lack of love. 'Twas in this guise Griselda cradled her soul's miseries, And nursed it in its anguish like a child, And soothed it to oblivion. The sea smiled With its eternal smile upon her sorrow, The selfsame yesterday, to-day, to-morrow, And kept its tears in its own bosom sealed, A mystery of passion unrevealed, Save in the tremor of its voice at noon, When the wind rose and played wild chords thereon. So she. The memory of that place long stood In her remembrance as a dream of good, Dividing life as sleep divides the day, A place of utter weakness. Let those say Who will, that deeds of strength life's milestones are. The dearest days are not the days of war, And victory is forgotten in the peace Of certain hours gone by in helplessness, When the soul ceased to battle, and lay still As on a deathbed dumb to good and ill. These are its treasures. Nor was silence all Griselda's ointment. Hard by the sea-wall, Where daily her steps turned fresh peace to find, A convent stood, inviting to the mind. Here she found entrance at the chapel gate, And knelt in prayer half-inarticulate, Bowed to the earth. For patron saints it had The Marys three—“two virtuous, and one bad,” Griselda thought, “like her own self”—who came In flight together from Jerusalem, And landed there; and these in her great need, She suppliant asked for her soul's daily bread, Using all fondest words her lips could frame, To speak her secret wishes without blame. Six candlesticks she vowed, to each a pair, So they would listen to and grant her prayer. The superstition pleased her. In her pride She bowed and begged like any peasant's bride, For what? for whom? she hardly could explain Even to her, the dear St. Magdalen. “And yet,” she argued, “she at least will know And understand me if no other do.” All this was folly, but it comforted And gave her strength. Then with a calmer head, If not a calmer heart, she turned once more From love to life. Her first strong grief was o'er. CHAPTER IV How shall I take up this vain parable And ravel out its issue? Heaven and Hell, The principles of good and evil thought, Embodied in our lives, have blindly fought Too long for empire in my soul to leave Much for its utterance, much that it can grieve. A soldier on the battlefield of life, I have grown callous to the signs of strife, And feel the wounds of others and my own With scarce a tremor and without a groan. I have seen many perish in their sins, Known much of frailty and inconsequence, And if I laughed once, now I dare not be Other than sad at man's insanity. Therefore, in all humility of years, Colder and wiser for hopes drowned in tears, And seeking no more quarries for my mirth, Who most need pity of the sons of earth, I dip in kindlier ink my chastened pen, And fill of my lost tale what leaves remain. Years passed. Griselda from my wandering sight Had waned and vanished, like a meteor bright, Leaving no pathway in my manhood's heaven Save only memories vaguely unforgiven Of something fair and sad, which for a day Had lit its zenith and had gone its way. Rome and the Prince, the tale that I had heard, Griselda's beauty—all that once had stirred My curious thought to wonder and regret, In the vexed problem of her woman's fate, Had yielded place to the world's work-day cares, The wealth it covets and the toil it dares. I was no more a boy, when idle chance And that light favour which attends romance Brought me once more within the transient spell Of other days, and dreams of Lady L. 'Twas in September—(I have always found That month in my life's record dangerous ground, Whether it be due to some unreasoned stress Of the mad stars which dog our happiness, Or whether, since in truth most things are due To natural causes, if our blindness knew, To the strong law of Nature's first decay, Warning betimes of time that cannot stay, And summer perishing, and hours to come, Lit by less hope in the year's martyrdom; And so we needs must seize at any cost Fleet pleasure's hem lest all our day be lost)— 'Twas in September, at a country house In the Midland shires, where I had come, God knows, Without a fancy but of such light sort As manhood ventures in the realms of sport With that dear god of slaughter England's sons Adore with incense-smoke and roar of guns, That this new chapter opens. Who had guessed So rare a phœnix housed in such a nest? For we, in truth, were no wise company, Men strong and joyous, keen of hand and eye, And shrewd for pleasure, but whose subtlest wit Was still to jest at life while using it, And jest at love, as at a fruit low hung To all men's lips, no matter whence it sprung. A fool's philosophy, yet dear to youth Bred without knowledge of the nobler truth, And seeming wisdom, till the bitter taste Of grief has come to cure its overhaste. Naught was there, in the scene nor in the parts Played by the actors, worthy serious hearts, Or worthy her whose passion trod a stage High o'er the frailties of our prurient age, Griselda and her unattained fair dream Of noble deeds and griefs unknown to them. How came she there? Our hostess was a woman Less famed for wisdom than a heart all human Rich in life's gifts, a wealthy generous soul, But still too fair and still too bountiful. The rest, mad hoydens of the world, whose worth Lay mired with folly, earthiest of the earth. How came she there? When I, unconscious all Of such high presence at our festival, Heard her name bandied in the general hum Of hungry tongues, which told the guests had come, And saw in converse with our host the form, Familiar once in sunshine and in storm, Of her who was to me the type and sign Of all things noble, not to say Divine, Breathing the atmosphere of that vain house, My heart stopped beating. Half incredulous, I looked and questioned in my neighbours' eyes, Seeking the sense of this supreme surprise. My thought took words, as at the table set Men's lips were loosed, discoursing while they ate, And each to each. Beside me, of the crew Of gilded youths who swelled the retinue Of our fair hostess in her daily lot Of hunting laughter when field sports were not, Sat one, a joyous boy, whom fashion's freak, A mad-cap purse-string and a beardless cheek, Had set pre-eminent in pleasure's school To play the hero and to play the fool For those few years which are the summer's day Of fashion's foils ere they are cast away. Young Jerry Manton! Happy fortune's son! What heights of vanity your creed had won, Creed of adventure, and untiring words And songs and loves as brainless as a bird's. Who would not envy you your lack of sense, Your lawless jibes, your wealth of insolence, The glory of your triumphs unconcealed In pleasure's inmost and most sacred field? Who would not share the sunshine of your mirth, Your god-like smile, your consciousness of worth, The keenness of your wit in the world's ways, Your heart so callous to its blame or praise? Him I addressed, in pursuance of my doubt How such a prodigy had come about. Young Manton eyed me. “Every road,” he said, “Leads—well—to Rome.” He laughed and shook his head, As if in censure of a thought less sage. “My lady's thirty is a dangerous age, And of the three where most misfortunes come Is the worst strewn with wrecks in Christendom.” “You see,” he added, “we are not all wise In all dilemmas and all companies, And there are times and seasons when the best Has need of an hour's frolic with the rest, If only to set free the importunate load Of trouble pressing on an uphill road. Women's first snare is vanity. At twenty Praises are pleasant, be they ne'er so plenty; And some, the foolish ones, are thus soon caught Seeking to justify the flattery taught. These are the spendthrifts, dear ingenuous souls, Whose names emblazoned stand on pleasure's rolls, Manning the hosts of mirth. Apart from them, More serious or less eager in their aim, The wise ones wait like birds that hold aloof, Conscious of danger and the cloven hoof. Yet there are times.” He paused awhile and sighed. “The second snare,” said he “is set less wide; It stands midway between the dawn of youth And beauty's sunset, with its naked truth, A danger hidden cunningly in flowers And the wild drowsing of the noontide hours. Here fall the elect, the chosen virtuous few, Who have outlived the worst the storm could do, But faint when it is over, through mere stress Of their mortality's first weariness. 'Tis hard to see youth perish, even when Ourselves to the mad warrant have set pen; And for the wisest there are days of grief And secret doubts and hours of unbelief In all things but the one forbidden bliss Churchmen forbid and poets call a kiss. Why should we wonder? 'Tis a kindlier fate At least than that, the last, which comes too late, The old fool's folly nursed at forty-five. Griselda is an angel, but alive, Believe me, to her wings.” A fatuous flush Mantled his face, not quite perhaps a blush, But something conscious, as of one who knows. “Virtue and pleasure are not always foes,” He sighed. “And much depends upon the man.” I turned impatient. There, behind her fan, At the far table's end, Griselda's eyes Were watching us, half hid by its disguise, But conscious too, as if a secret string Had vibrated 'twixt her and that vain thing. The cynic boy, whose word was in my ear, Dishonouring to me and him and her. Our eyes met, and hers fell; a sudden pain Touched me of memory, and in every vein Ran jealous anger at young Manton's wit, While, half aloud, I flung my curse on it. Later, I found Griselda gravely gay, And glad to see me in the accustomed way Of half affection my long zeal had won, Her face no older, though the years had spun Some threads unnoticed in her fair brown hair Of lighter hue than I remembered there, Less silver streaked than gold. All else had grown Fairer with time, and tenderer in its tone, As when in August woods a second burst Of leaves is seen more golden than the first. A woman truly to be loved—but loving? There was the riddle wit despaired of proving, For who can read the stars? I sat with her The evening through, and rose up happier. In all that crowd there was no single face Worthy her notice, not to say her grace, And once again her charm was on my soul. “If she love any”—this was still the goal Of my night thoughts in argument with fear— “Say what they will, the lover is not here.” Not here! And yet, at parting, she had pressed Manton's sole hand, and nodded to the rest. Four days I lived in my fool's paradise, Importuning Griselda's changing eyes With idle flattery. I found her mood Softer than once in her young womanhood, Yet restless and uncertain. There were hours Of a wild gaiety, when all the powers Of her keen mind were in revolt with folly, Others bedimmed with wordless melancholy. Once too or twice she shocked me with a phrase Of doubtful sense, revealing thoughts and ways New to her past, an echo of the noise Of that mad world we lived in and its joys: Such things were sacrilege. I could not see Unmoved my angel smirched with vanity, Even though, it seemed at moments, for my sake. Her laughter, when she laughed, made my heart ache, And I had spared some pain to see her sad Rather than thus unseasonably glad. Who would have dreamed it? Each new idle day, When, tired with sport, we rested from the fray, Five jovial shooters, jaded by the sun, Seeking refreshment at the stroke of noon,— There, with the luncheon carts all trimly dight, Stood Lady L., to the fool crowd's delight. You would have thought her life had always been Passed in the stubbles, as, with questions keen, She eyed the bags and parleyed with the “guns”; Rome's matron she with us the Goths and Huns. Young Manton proudly spread for her his coat Under a hedge, and she resented not. Resented! Why resent? Nay, smiles were there, And a swift look of pleasure, still more rare, Pleasure and gratitude, as though the act Had been of chivalry in form and fact Transcending Raleigh's. Ay, indeed! Resent! That eye were blind which doubted what it meant. And still I doubted. Vanity dies hard. And love, however starving of reward, And youth's creed of belief. It seemed a thing Monstrous, impossible, bewildering, As tales of dwarfs and giants gravely told By men of science, and transmuted gold, And magic potions turning men to beasts, And lewd witch Sabbaths danced by unfrocked priests. Griselda! Manton! In what mood or tense Could folly conjugate such dreams to sense, Or draw the contract not in terms absurd Of such a friendship or of act or word? Where was the common thought between the two— Even of partridges—the other knew? Manton—Griselda! Nay 'twere fabulous, A mere profanity, to argue thus; Only I watched them closer when they strayed To gather blackberries, as boy and maid In a first courting, and her eager eyes Turned as he spoke, and laughter came unwise Before she answered, and an hour was flown, Before he joined the rest and she was gone. O Love! what an absurdity thou art, How heedless of proportion, whole or part! Time, place, occasion, what are they to thee? Thou playest the wanton with Solemnity, The prince with Poverty, the rogue with Worth, The fool with all the Wisdoms of the Earth. Thou art a leveller, more renowned than Death, For he, when in his rage he stops our breath, Leaves us at least the harvest of our years, The right to be heroic in our tears. But thou dost only mock. Thou art a king Dealing with slaves, who waits no questioning But gives—to this a province and a crown, To that a beggar's staff and spangled gown; And when some weep their undeserved disgrace, Plucks at their cheeks and smites them in the face. Thou hast no reverence, no respect for right. Virtue to thee is a lewd appetite, Remorse a pastime, modesty a lure, And love, the malady, love's only cure. Griselda, in her love at thirty-three Was the supreme fool of felicity. Reason and she had taken separate roads, A spectacle of mirth for men and gods. And the world laughed—discreetly in its sleeves— At her poor artless shifts and make-believes. For it was true, true to the very text, This whispered thing that had my soul perplexed, Manton was her beloved—by what art, What mute equation of the human heart, What blind jibe of dame Fortune, who shall say? The road of passion is no king's highway, Mapped out with finger-posts for all to see, But each soul journeys on it separately, And only those who have walked its mazes through Remember on what paths the wild flowers grew. Ay, who shall say? Nor had the truth been sung, Save for the incontinence of Manton's tongue, Wagging in argument on certain themes, With boast of craft in pleasure's stratagems. “For Love” ('twas thus he made his parable In cynic phrase, as hero of his tale, One evening when the others were abed, And we two sat on smoking, head to head, Discoursing in that tone of men scarce friends, Who prate philosophy to candle ends), “Love, though its laws have not as yet been written By any Balzac for our modern Britain, And though perhaps there is no strategy Youth can quite count upon or argue by, Is none the less an art, with some few rules Wise men observe, who would outrun the fools. Now, for myself” (here Manton spread his hands With professorial wave in white wrist-bands) “I hold it as a maxim always wise In making love to deal with contraries. Colours, books tell us, to be strongly blent, Need opposite colours for their complement, And so too women whose ill-reasoning mind Requires some contradiction to be kind. It is not enough in this late year of grace To answer fools with their own foolishness— Rather with your best wisdom. You will need Your folly to perplex some wiser head. And so my maxim is, whatever least Women expect, that thing will serve you best. Thus, with young souls in their first unfledged years, Ask their opinion as philosophers: Consult their knowledge in the ways of life. The repute of sin will please a too chaste wife. Your deference keep for harlots: these you touch Best by your modesty, which makes them blush. With a proud beauty deal out insolence, And bear her fence down with a stronger fence. She will be angry, but a softer cheek Turn to the smiter who has proved her weak. And so with wisdom: meet it with surprise, Laugh at it idly gazing in its eyes, Leave it no solid ground for its fair feet, And lead it lightly where love's waters meet. Even virtue—virtue of the noblest type, The fair sad woman, whose romance is ripe, Needs but a little knowledge to be led, Perhaps less than the rest if truth be said. You must not parley with her. Words are vain, And you might wake some half forgotten pain. Avoid her soul. It is a place too strong For your assaulting, and a siege were long. Others have failed before it. Touch it not, But march beyond, nor fire a single shot. The fields of pleasure less defended lie: These are your vantage-ground for victory. Strike boldly for possession and command; An hour may win it, if you hold her hand. I knew one once:” . . . I would have stopped him here But for the shame which held me prisoner; And his undaunted reassuring smile, Commanding confidence. “I knew once on a while,” He said, “a woman whom the world called proud, A saintly soul, untouched by the vain crowd, Who had survived all battle, siege, and sack, Love ever led with armies at his back, Yet fell at last to the mere accident Of a chance meeting, for another meant, Her lover had not dared it, had he known, But faces in the dark are all as one. You know the rhyme.” But at this point I rose, Fearing what worse his folly might disclose, And having learned my lesson of romance, A sadder man and wiser for the chance, Bade him good night: (it was in truth good-bye, For pretexting next morning some small lie Of business calling me in haste to town, I fled the house). He looked me up and down, Yawned, rose to light his candle at the lamp, Pressed with warm hand my own hand which was damp, And as he sauntered cheerily to bed, I heard him sing—they linger in my head— The first staves of a ballad, then the fashion With the young bloods who shape their love and passion At the music-halls of the Metropolis; What I remember of the song was this: But, no, I cannot write it. There are things Too bitter in their taste, and this one stings My soul to a mad anger even yet. I seem to hear the voices of the pit Lewdly discoursing of incestuous scenes, Bottom the weaver's and the enamoured queen's. Alas, Titania! thou poor soul, alas! How art thou fallen, and to what an ass! CHAPTER V Griselda's madness lasted forty days, Forty eternities! Men went their ways, And suns arose and set, and women smiled, And tongues wagged lightly in impeachment wild Of Lady L.'s adventure. She was gone, None knew by whom escorted or alone, Or why or whither, only that one morning, Without pretext, or subterfuge, or warning, She had disappeared in silence from L. House, Leaving her lord in multitudinous And agonised conjecture of her fate: So the tale went. And truly less sedate Than his wont was in intricate affairs, Such as his Garter or his lack of heirs, Lord L. was seen in this new tribulation. Griselda long had been his life's equation, The pivot of his dealings with the world, The mainstay of his comfort, all now hurled To unforeseen confusion by her flight: There was need of action swift and definite. Where was she? Who could tell him? Divers visions Passed through his fancy—thieves, and street collisions, And all the hundred accidents of towns, From broken axle trees to broken crowns. In vain he questioned; no response was made More than the fact that, as already said, My lady, unattended and on foot, (A sad imprudence here Lord L. took note), Had gone out dressed in a black morning gown And dark tweed waterproof, 'twixt twelve and one, Leaving no orders to her maid, or plan About her carriage to or groom or man. Such was in sum the downstairs' evidence. The hall porter, a man of ponderous sense, Averred her ladyship had eastward turned From the front door, and some small credit earned For the suggestion that her steps were bent To Whitechapel on merciful intent, A visit of compassion to the poor, A clue which led to a commissioner Being sent for in hot haste from Scotland Yard. And so the news was bruited abroad. It reached my ears among the earliest, And from Lord L. himself, whose long suppressed Emotion found its vent one afternoon On me, the only listener left in town. His thoughts now ran on “a religious craze Of his poor wife's,” he said, “in these last days Indulged beyond all reason.” The police Would listen to no talk of casualties, Still less of crime, since they had nothing found In evidence above or under ground, But held the case to be of simpler kind, Home left in a disordered state of mind. Lord L. had noticed, now they talked of it, Temper less equable and flightier wit, “A craving for religious services And sacred music.” Something was amiss, Or why were they in London in September? Griselda latterly, he could remember, Had raved of a conventual retreat In terms no Protestant would deem discreet As the sole refuge in a world of sin For human frailty, grief's best anodyne. “The Times was right. Rome threatened to absorb us: The convents must be searched by habeas corpus.” And so I came to help him. I had guessed From his first word the vainness of his quest, And half was moved to serve him in a strait Where her fair fame I loved was in debate, Yet held my peace, nor hazarded a word Save of surprise at the strange case I heard, Till, fortune aiding, I should find the clue My heart desired to do what I would do. And not in vain. Night found me duly sped, Lord L.'s ambassador accredited, With fullest powers to find and fetch her home, If need should be, from the Pope's jaws in Rome. Gods! what a mission! First my round I went Through half the slums of Middlesex and Kent, Surrey and Essex—this to soothe Lord L., Though witless all, as my heart told too well; The hospitals no less and casual wards, Each house as idly as his House of Lords, And only at the week's end dared to stop At the one door I knew still housing hope, Young Manton's chambers. There, with reddened cheek I heard the answer given I came to seek. Manton was gone, his landlady half feared He too, in some mishap, and disappeared,— Proof all too positive. His letters lay A fortnight deep untouched upon the tray. She could not forward them or risk a guess As to his last or likeliest address. He was in Scotland often at this season, “But not without his guns”—a cogent reason. And leaving, too, his valet here in town, Perplexed of what to do or leave undone. Abroad? Perhaps. If so, his friends might try As a best chance the Paris Embassy. He had been there last Spring, and might be now. Paris! It was enough, I made my bow, And took my leave. I seemed to touch the thread Of the blind labyrinth 'twas mine to tread. Where should they be, in truth, these too fond lovers, But in the land of all such lawless rovers? The land of Gautier, Bourget, Maupassant, Where still “you can” makes answer to “I can't.” The fair domain where all romance begins In a light borderland of venial sins, But deepening onwards, till the fatal day Vice swoops upon us, plead we as we may. Griselda's bonnet o'er the windmills thrown, Had surely crossed the Seine ere it came down. And I, if I would find and win her back, Must earliest search the boulevards for her track. And so to Paris in my zeal I passed, Breaking my idol, mad Iconoclast. There is a little inn by Meudon wood Dear to Parisians in their amorous mood, A place of rendezvous, where bourgeois meet Their best beloved in congregation sweet; Clandestine, undisturbed, illicit loves, Made half romantic by the adjoining groves, So beautiful in Spring, with the new green Clothing the birch stems scattered white between, Nor yet, in Autumn, when the first frosts burn And the wind rustles in the reddening fern, Quite robbed of sentiment for lovers' eyes, Who seek Earth's blessing on a bliss unwise, And find the happy sanction for their state In nature's face, unshocked by their debate, As who should say “Let preachers frown their fill, Here one approves. 'Tis Eden with us still.” Such fancy, may be, in her too fond heart Had led Griselda—with her friend—apart, Yet not apart, from the world's curious gaze, To this secluded, ill-frequented place: A compromise of wills and varying moods, His for gay crowds, her own for solitudes. Manton knew Paris well, and loved its noise, Its mirthful parody of serious joys, Its pomp and circumstance. His wish had been To flaunt the boulevards with his captured queen, And make parade of a last triumph won In the chaste field of prudish Albion, Outscandalising scandal. Love and he In any sense but of male vanity, And the delirium of adventures new In the world's eye—the thing he next should do— Were terms diverse and incompatible. Griselda, to his eyes was Lady L., The fair, the chaste, the unapproached proud name Men breathed in reverence, woman, all the same, And not as such, and when the truth was said, Worth more than others lightlier credited. It all had been a jest from the beginning, A tour de force, whose wit was in the winning, A stroke of fortune and of accident, The embrace he had told of for another meant, While she stood grieving for a first grey hair (A psychologic moment) on the stair, And, kneeling down, he had adored her foot, The one weak spot where her self-love had root, And laughed at her, and told her she was old, Yet growing tenderer as he grew more bold. And so from jest to jest, and chance to chance, To that last scene at the mad country dance Where she had played the hoyden, he the swain, Pretending love till love was in their brain, And he had followed to her chamber door, And helped her to undo the dress she wore. Then the elopement. That had been her doing, Which he accepted to make good his wooing, And careless what to both the result might be, So it but served his end of vanity. It all had been to this vain boy a whim, Something grotesque, a play, a pantomime, Where nothing had been serious but her heart, And that was soon too tearful for its part. He wearied in a week of her mature Old maidish venturings in ways obscure, Her agony of conscience dimly guessed, The silences she stifled in her breast, Her awkwardness—it was his word—in all That love could teach; her sighs funereal, And more the unnatural laughter she essayed To meet the doubtful sense of things he said. She was at once too tender and too prim, Too prudish and too crazed with love and him. At a month's end his flame had leaped beyond Already to friends frailer and less fond; The light Parisian world of venal charms Which welcomed him with wide and laughing arms: There he was happier, more at home, more gay, King of the “High Life,” hero of the day. Griselda, in her sad suburban nook Watched his departures with a mute rebuke, Yet daring not to speak. The choice was hers To stay at home or run the theatres With her young lover in such company As her soul loathed. She had tried despairingly To be one, even as these, for his loved sake, And would have followed spite of her heart's ache, But that he hardly further cared to press, After one failure stamped with “dowdiness.” That too had been his word, a bitter word, Biting and true, which smote her like a sword, Or rather a whip's sting to her proud cheek, Leaving her humbled, agonised and weak. Poor beautiful Griselda! What was now The value of thy beauty, chaste as snow In thy youth's morning, the unchallenged worth Of thy eyes' kindness, queenliest of the earth; The tradition of thy Fra-angelic face, Blessed as Mary's, and as full of grace; The fame which thou despisedst, yet which made A glory for thee meet for thy dear head? What, if in this last crisis of thy fate, When all a Heaven and Hell was in debate, And thy archangel, with the feet of clay, Stood mocking there in doubt to go or stay, The unstable fabric of thy woman's dower, Thy beauty, failed and left thee in their power Whose only law of beauty was the sting Lent to man's lust by light bedizening? What use was in thy beauty, if, alas! Thou gavest them cause to mock (those tongues of brass) At thy too crude and insular attire, Thy naïvetés of colour, the false fire Of thy first dallyings with the red and white, Thy sweet pictorial robe, Pre-Raphaelite, Quaint in its tones and outré in design, Thy lack of unity and shape and line, Thy English angularity—who knows, The less than perfect fitting of thy shoes? Griselda, in her flight, had left behind All but the dress she stood in, too refined, In her fair righteousness of thought and deed, To make provision for a future need, However dire. She was no Israelite To go forth from her Pharaoh in the night, With spoils of the Egyptians in her hands, And had thrown herself on Manton and on France, With a full courage worth a nobler cause, Grandly oblivious of prudential laws. Her earliest trouble, marring even the bliss Of love's first ecstasy, had come of this, Her want of clothes—a worse and weightier care At the mere moment than her soul's despair For its deep fall from virtuous estate. How should she dress herself, she asked of Fate, With neither maid, nor money, nor a name? It was her first experiment in shame. Now, after all her poor economies, This was the ending read in his vexed eyes, And spoken by his lips: her utmost art Had failed to please that idle thing, his heart, Or even to avert his petulant scorn For one so little to love's manner born. And thus I found them, at the angry noon Of their “red month,” the next to honeymoon: Two silent revellers at a loveless feast, Scared by hate's morning breaking in their East— A dawn which was of penance and despair, With pleasure's ghost to fill the vacant chair. I took it, and was welcomed rapturously, As a far sail by shipwrecked souls at sea, An opportune deliverer, timely sent To break the autumn of their discontent, And give a pretext to their need grown sore Of issue from joys dead by any door. Manton, all confidential from the first, Told me the tale of his last sins and worst, As meriting a sympathy not less Than the best actions virtuous men confess. He was overwhelmed with women and with debt— Women who loved him, bills which must be met. What could he do? Her ladyship was mad— It was her fault, not his, this escapade. He had warned her from the first, and as a friend, That all such frolics had a serious end, And that to leave her home was the worst way A woman would who wanted to be gay. “For look,” said he, “we men, who note these things, And how the unthinking flutterers burn their wings, Know that a woman, be she what she will, The fairest, noblest, most adorable, Dowered in her home with all seraphic charms, Whom heaven itself might envy in your arms, A paragon of pleasure undenied At her own chaste respectable fireside, Becomes, what shall I say, when she steps down From the high world of her untouched renown? A something differing in no serious mood From the sad rest of the light sisterhood; Perhaps indeed more troublesome than these, Because she keenlier feels the agonies: A wounded soul, who has not even the wit To hide its hurt and make a jest of it; A maid of Astolat, launched in her barge, A corpse on all the world, a femme à charge.” “'Tis not,” he argued, “our poor human sins That make us what we are when shame begins, But the world pointing at our naked state: Then we are shocked and humbled at our fate, Silent and shamed in all we honour most— For what is virtue but the right to boast? A married woman's love, three weeks from home, Is the absurdest thing in Christendom, Dull as a ménage in the demi-monde And dismaller far by reason of the bond. All this I told my lady ere we went, But warning wasted is on sentiment. You see the net result here in one word, A crying woman and a lover bored.” So far young Manton. She for whom I came, Griselda's self, sweet soul, in her new shame Essayed awhile to hide from me the truth Of this last hap of her belated youth, Her disillusion with her graceless lover. She made sad cloaks for him which could not cover His great unworthiness and her despair, All with a frightened half-maternal air, Most pitiful and touching. To my plea, Urging her home, she answered mournfully, That she was bound now to her way of life, And owed herself no less than as his wife To him she had chosen out of all mankind. 'Twas better to be foolish, even blind, If he had faults, so she could serve him still— And this had been her promise and her will. She would not hear of duties owed elsewhere: What was she to Lord L., or he to her? I need not speak of it. And yet she clung To my protecting presence in her wrong; And once, when Manton's jibes made bitterer play, Implored me with appealing eyes to stay. And so I lingered on. Those autumn days, Spent with Griselda in the woodland ways Of Meudon with her lover, or alone, When his mad fancies carried him to town, Remain to me an unsubstantial act Of dreaming fancy, rather than the fact Of any waking moment in my past, The sweetest, saddest and with her the last— For suddenly they ended. We had been One Sunday for a jaunt upon the Seine, We two—in Manton's absence, now prolonged To a third night—and in a steamboat, thronged With idle bourgeois folk, whom the last glory, Of a late autumn had sent forth in foray To Passy and St. Cloud, from stage to stage Had made with heavy souls our pilgrimage; And homeward turning and with little zest, The fair day done, to love's deserted nest Had come with lagging feet and weary eyes, Expectant still of some new dark surprise, When the blow fell unsparing on her head, Already by what fortunes buffeted. How did it happen, that last tragedy?— For tragedy it was, let none deny, Though all ignoble. Every soul of us Touches one moment in death's darkened house The plane of the heroic, and compels Men's laughter into tears—ay, Heaven's and Hell's. How did it happen? There was that upon Their faces at the door more than the tone Of their replies, that warned us of the thing We had not looked for in our questioning; And our lips faltered, and our ears, afraid, Shrank from more hearing. What was it they said In their fool's jargon, that he lay upstairs? He? Manton? The dispenser of our cares? The mounteback young reveller? Suffering? Ill? And she, poor soul, that suffered at his will! A sinister case? Not dying? Pitiful God! Truly Thou smitest blindly with Thy rod. For Manton was not worthy to die young, Beloved by her with blessings on her tongue. And such a cause of death! She never heard The whole truth told, for each one spared his word, And he lay mute for ever. But to me The thing was storied void of mystery, And thus they told it. Hardly had we gone On our sad river outing, when from town Manton had come with a gay troop of friends, Such as the coulisse of the opera lends, To breakfast at the inn and spend the day In mirthful noise, as was his vagrant way. A drunken frolic, and most insolent To her whose honour with his own was blent, To end in this last tragedy. None knew Quite how it happened, or a cause could shew Further than this, that, rising from the table, The last to go with steps perhaps unstable— For they had feasted freely, and the stair Was steep and iron-edged, and needed care; And singing, as he went, the selfsame song, Which I remembered, to the laughing throng, He had slipped his length, and fallen feet-first down. When they picked him up his power to move was gone, Though he could speak. They laid him on a bed, Her bed, Griselda's, and called in with speed Such help of doctors and commissioners As law prescribed, and medicine for their fears. 'Twas his last night. There, in Griselda's hands, Young Jerry Manton lay with the last sands Of his life's hour-glass trickling to its close, Griselda watching, with what thoughts, God knows. We did not speak. But her lips moved in prayer, And mine too, in the way of man's despair. I did not love him, yet a human pity Softened my eyes. Afar, from the great city, The sound came to us of the eternal hum, Unceasing, changeless, pregnant with all doom Of insolent life that rises from its streets, The pulse of sin which ever beats and beats, Wearying the ears of God. O Paris, Paris! What doom is thine for every soul that tarries Too long with thee, a stranger in thy arms. Thy smiles are incantations, thy brave charms Death to thy lovers. Each gay mother's son, Smitten with love for thee, is straight undone. And lo the chariot wheels upon thy ways! And a new garland hung in Père la Chaise! Poor soul! I turned and looked into the night, Through the uncurtained windows, and there bright Saw the mute twinkle of a thousand stars. One night! the least in all time's calendars, Yet fraught with what a meaning for this one! One star, the least of all that million! One room in that one city! Yet for him The universe there was of space and time. What were his thoughts? In that chaotic soul, Home of sad jests, obscene, unbeautiful, Mired with the earthiest of brute desires, And lit to sentience only with lewd fires, Was there no secret, undisturbed, fair place Watered with love and favoured with God's grace To which the wounded consciousness had fled For its last refuge from a world of dread? Was his soul touched to tenderness, to awe, To softer recollection? All we saw Was the maimed body gasping forth its breath, A rigid setting of the silent teeth, And the hands trembling. Death was with us there. But where was he? O Heaven of pity! where? We watched till morning by the dying man, She weeping silently, I grieved and wan, And still he moved not. But with the first break Of day in the window panes we saw him make A sign as if of speaking. Pressing near— For his lips moved, Griselda deemed, in prayer— We heard him make profession of his faith, As a man of pleasure face to face with death, A kind of gambler's Athanasian Creed, Repeated at the hour of his last need. “Five sovereigns,” said he, steadying his will, As in defiance of death's power to kill, And with that smile of a superior mind, Which was his strength in dealing with mankind, The world of sporting jargon and gay livers. “Five sovereigns is a fiver, and five fivers A pony, and five ponies are a hundred— No, four,” he added, seeing he had blundered. “Four to the hundred and five centuries Make up the monkey.” From his dying eyes The smile of triumph faded. “There, I've done it,” He said, “but there was no great odds upon it, You see with a broken back.” He spoke no more, And in another hour had passed the door Which shuts the living from eternity. Where was he? God of pity, where was he? This was the end of Lady L.'s romance. When we had buried him (as they do in France, In a tomb inscribed “à perpétuité,” Formally rented till the Judgment Day), She put off black, and shed no further tears; Her face for the first time showed all its years, But not a trace beyond. Without demur She gave adhesion to my plans for her, And we went home to London and Lord L., Silent together, by the next night's mail. She had been six weeks away. The interview Between them was dramatic. I, who knew Her whole mad secret, and had seen her soul Stripped of its covering, and without control, Bowed down by circumstance and galled with shame, Yielding to wounds and griefs without a name, Had feared for her a wild unhappy scene. I held Lord L. for the least stern of men, And yet I dared not hope even he would crave No explanation ere he quite forgave. I was with them when they met, unwilling third, In their mute bandying of the unspoken word. Lord L. essayed to speak. I saw his face Made up for a high act of tragic grace As he came forward. It was grave and mild, A father's welcoming a truant child, Forgiving, yet intent to mark the pain With hope “the thing should not occur again.” His lips began to move as to some speech Framed in this sense, as one might gently preach A word in season to too gadding wives Of duties owed, at least by those whose lives Moved in high places. But it died unsaid. There was that about Griselda that forbade Marital questionings. Her queenly eyes Met his with a mute answer of surprise, Marking the unseemliness of all display More strongly than with words, as who should say Noblesse oblige. She took his outstretched hand, And kissed his cheek, but would not understand A word of his reproaches. Even I, With my full knowledge and no more a boy, But versed by years in the world's wickedness, And open-eyed to her, alas! no less Than to all womanhood, even I felt shame, And half absolved her in my mind from blame. And he, how could he less? He was but human, The fortunate husband of how fair a woman! He stammered his excuses. What she told When I had left them (since all coin is gold To those who would believe, and who the key Hold of their eyes, in blind faith's alchemy) I never learned. I did not linger on, Seeing her peril past and the day won, But took my leave. She led me to the door With her old kindness of the days of yore, And thanked me as one thanks for little things. “You have been,” she said, “an angel without wings, And I shall not forget,—nor will Lord L.; And yet,” she said, with an imperceptible Change in her voice, “there are things the world will say Which are neither just nor kind, and, if to-day We part awhile, remember we are friends, If not now later. Time will make amends, And we shall meet again.” I pressed her hand A moment to my lips. “I understand,” I said, and gazed a last time in her eyes; “Say all you will. I am your sacrifice.” And so, in truth, it was. Henceforth there lay A gulf between us, widening with delay, And which our souls were impotent to pass, The gulf of a dead secret; and, alas! Who knows what subtle treacheries within, For virtue rends its witnesses of sin, And hearts are strangely fashioned by their fears. We met no more in friendship through the years, Although I held her secret as my own, And fought her battles, her best champion, On many a stricken field in scandal's war, Till all was well forgotten. From afar I watched her fortunes still with tenderness, Yet sadly, as cast out of Paradise. For ever, spite her promise, from that day, When I met L., he looked another way; And she, Griselda, was reserved and chill. I had behaved, her women friends said, ill, And caused a needless scandal in her life, —They told not what. Enough, that as a wife She had been compelled to close her doors on me, And that her lord knew all the iniquity. And so I bore the burden of her sin. What more shall I relate? The cynic vein Has overwhelmed my tale, and I must stop. Its heroine lived to justify all hope Of her long-suffering lord, that out of pain Blessings would grow, and his house smile again With the fulfilled expectance of an heir. Griselda sat no longer in despair, Nor wasted her full life on dreams of folly; She had little time for moods of melancholy, Or heart to venture further in love's ways; She was again the theme of all men's praise, And suffered no man's passion. Once a year, In the late autumn, when the leaves grew sere She made retreat to a lay sisterhood, And lived awhile there for her soul's more good, In pious meditation, fasts and prayer. Some say she wore concealed a shirt of hair Under her dresses, even at court balls, And certain 'tis that all Rome's rituals Were followed daily at the private Mass In her new chauntry built behind Hans Place. Lord L. approved of all she did, even this, Strange as it seemed to his old-fashionedness. He, gentle soul, grown garrulous with years, Prosed of her virtues to all listeners, And of their son's, the child of his old age, A prodigy of beauty and ways sage. It was a vow, he said, once made in Rome, Had brought them their chief treasure of their home. A vow! The light world laughed—for miracles Are not believed in now, except as Hell's. And yet the ways of God are passing strange. And this is certain (and therein the range Of my long tale is reached, and I am free), —There is at Ostia, close beside the sea, A convent church, the same where years ago Griselda kneeled in tears and made her vow; And in that shrine, beneath the crucifix, They show a votive offering, candlesticks Of more than common workmanship and size, And underneath inscribed the votary's Name in initials, and the date, all told, Hall-marked in England, and of massive gold. NATALIA'S RESURRECTION A SONNET SEQUENCE I Oh! woe is me for beauty idly blown! And woe for passionate youth and joys that wait! And woe for foolish love that is undone By woman's fear, and fortune come too late! And woe for empty words and hours that were Squandered in weeping! Woe, because of Death Who was at hand, and, while joy languished near Fearing to enter, quickly from its sheath Drew out his sword and laid its point unto That virgin breast, and there in stern embrace Did all that happiness had dared not do, Rifling the treasures of that holy place, And heeding not Love's shriek. Alas, poor Love! Death will not spare what thou hast spared to prove. II 'Twas thus with my Natalia, suppliant soul, Who loved young Adrian to her heart's despite, And loved him dearly, yet could not cajole Her fears of ill nor use her woman's right To grant his wish, but ever put away The sweet fulfilment of each day's desire To a new to-morrow void as yesterday. Adrian in vain, with wild hopes high and higher, Essayed to make her convert to his creed. No laggard he to do, devise or dare. But still she failed him ever at his need, And still she gave but tears to his heart's prayer. And days and nights went cheerless for them both, And not a flower was gathered of love's troth. III Matron was she of a great Roman house, And wed in youth to one she might not love; Her birth, her fortune, her name luminous, Such as all noblest virtues most behove. How dare she trifle with ignoble things, Or yield her fair fame to a stranger's care, Or let her passionate desire take wings, Or be of those unchastely debonnaire? Yet with him she was well, and far from him A bird shaft-stricken which no more may fly. She deemed his smile as of the seraphim, And in his frown she was one like to die. For his dear sake 'twixt niggard hopes and fears She lived in death for two long weary years. IV But Adrian, who was young and all athirst For human joy, and turbulent and strong, Grew discontent with her despairs and curst, Nor spared he her the jibings of his tongue. He mocked at her vain virtue and the words She used to comfort him when sometimes she With weak heart battling, like a troubled bird's Which sees the nets, would ease his misery With telling her own pain and making show Of her soul's hunger to his hungry soul. It only angered him, this prate of woe, And back he thrust on her her beggar's dole Of idle sighs. And “If I have not bread, For pity let me be and starve,” he said. V Until it happened, as such things will be, That she, who had a proud man for her spouse None the less loving that unloved was he, Must bear a child, the heir to his high house. Then Adrian left her. It was idle sorrow Longer to wait a suppliant at her door, Weeping the promise of a lost to-morrow Which never could be his nor valued more. And he was tired of tears and nightly needed To feed his manhood's strength on stronger meat, And neither word of hers nor vow he heeded, Who was thus proved a daughter of deceit; And he was wrath with her and womanhood, And with himself, and chiefly wrath with God. VI So he departed angry and in haste, A bitter wanderer on the ways of life: He cared not whither so he found a feast Spread for his hunger which should need no strife. He went out silent, scornful and alone, That none might pity him. He would not make Of his too public grief a public moan, Nor yet feign laughter for his manhood's sake, For now that love was lost he less had heart To cast his pride too on the dunghill there, And his were griefs where none could bear a part, And his a cup of pain no lips could share. He went his way, to Germany some said, And some to Naples, some that he was dead. VII But where he fared and how, it matters not. He and his mourning ere a month had run Were out of mind with all and clean forgot, Kinsman and friend and foe: save only one, Only Natalia. She with tightened breath Heard his name spoken in reproof's vain way And gave her melancholy soul to death. Foolish Natalia, who in love's full day Had spent her grief, had nothing now to give Of greater woe to her soul's agonies. Living she yet had hardly dared to live. She had wept dry the fountains of her eyes, And never on her sorrow broke a gleam Of that assuagement tears on others stream. VIII And so it was that, sitting ever thus Dumb to all speech of those that knew her woe And bare with her sole sorrow in the house, And ever watching with sad eyes below To see if any came with help for her Whom none could help with pity or with pride Or word of patience, ere her time was near, She bore her yet unliving child and died. There was great mourning for her in those days Because of her high lineage and fair youth. Men knowing her spoke nobly in her praise, Or knowing not yet mourned for very ruth. And all Rome wept for her, and far and wide The fame was noised how of her love she died. IX Thus Adrian learned it. And behold, his heart, Which he had hardened against all dismay, And wrapped up secretly and laid apart As something which should not be used to-day, Woke with a pang, and tremulously wan Started and listened. There in the new morn Of this grey wakening, like a long drowned man Brought back to life, he knew the world forlorn By the dull ache which was in every limb. The ghastly pleasures which had gorged his care Paled as he looked at them. His dead lusts dim Stank like lost corpses in the morning air. And yet 'twas passing sweet, despite the pain, To feel and move and live and love again. X But with full daylight finding no relief, Though he had spent the newness of his fears And looked with altered eyes upon his grief, For sorrow often drowses in its tears, And men sleep deepest on a wound, he rose And taking horse made in all haste for Rome, Thinking if thus he might assuage his woes By visiting his dead Natalia's tomb And asking of her dear new-buried lips What secret thought had been of love and him When the world left her in its last eclipse. And still in passionate words he made his theme, That she was waiting yet to hear his cry: “O my soul's soul, I did not bid thee die.” XI So in his agony at noon he came, On the third day, to where without the walls Stood San Lorenzo with its front of flame, Where mourners wait the accustomed funerals. Here to a cypress having tied his steed, He lighted down sore weary on the grass, Seeking such comfort for his body's need As rest could lend till the day's heat should pass And no man stopped him, either friend or foe Or knight or citizen or friar or priest; Nor sought he more companionship of woe Than the dumb presence of his jaded beast. There, hidden in the shade where he had crept, Adrian o'erspent with sorrow soundly slept. XII He slept as only under the free heaven It is given to sleep, a slumber shadowless As the broad river to whose banks at even That spirit comes which brings forgetfulness, A silence undisturbed by the world's tread, Which sees not, hears not, feels not, yet is girt With sound and light and sense; which seeming dead Drinks in Earth's life in cure of every hurt And so takes consolation. Dreams anon Come for the soul's refreshment, apparitions Begot of heaven's beauty and the sun, No meaningless expectance of sad visions But tales prophetic of new days more fair And to be numbered with the things that are, XIII A heritage for ever. Such a sleep Came upon Adrian and such a dream, As in the shade he lay a weary heap. For, while he rested, still it seemed to him He rode towards the city of his love, Only in mirth not sadness. And, behold, In his soothed bosom Hope, a brooding dove, Had made again her nest, and manifold Fair pleasures round him seemed to perch and sing Like wild birds in the branches overhead, And his heart leaped in joy with everything, As in the days ere yet his joys were dead, Until he found himself, it seemed, in Rome And knocking at the doors of his own home. XIV His servants opened. None appeared to doubt How it might happen their young lord stood there, But led him in. The house as for a rout Stood swept and garnished and exceeding fair. Adrian's strange eyes, long widowed of the sight, Found all things larger, nobler and more proud Than on the day he left them in his flight, A love-sick boy by a long sorrow bowed. And still through halls and corridors he went And found new treasures still at every door, Mirrors and silks and fretwork excellent, And panelled tapestry and marbled floor. He paused in wonder and delight at each, Pleased to his soul to find himself thus rich. XV Anon, ere yet his pleasure was aware Of other presence with him in that place, A growing murmur in the jubilant air, With hum of voices gathering apace, And laughter interchanged, and tones well known, And steps approaching him familiar-wise, And names that seemed an echo of his own, Broke on his musing. Turning in surprise He saw around him a gay company, Faces of kinsmen or of friends as near, But dead or changed or wed: all now in joy, Such as they showed him once in days more dear Ere yet his manhood had been touched with pain, Stood forth to greet him to their hearts again. XVI Among the rest ('twas thus his dream went on While Adrian slept) in more than courteous mood And smiling welcome, fairer scarce was none, That noble knight Natalia's husband stood, A gentle man whom of a truth in life, Alas for jealous youth and wit too keen! Adrian loved little though he loved his wife, But now beheld as the most blest of men,— Because Natalia was not dead, he thought, Seeing him thus unconscious of all grief,— And in that cloudless face where pain was not Adrian found omen to his soul's relief, And looked beyond if haply he should see Her face too following fixed in constancy. XVII Nor yet in vain. For to him through the rout Behold, 'mid herald whispers of her name And laughing eyes and welcome hands held out, Natalia's self behind her husband came, Her face arrayed in smiles, as who should say She held a secret string of happiness Joined to her heart grief could not take away. And Adrian gazed at her in rapturous bliss, Knowing his love had triumphed o'er the grave And she at last was his, a heritage For ever for his heart to hold and have, In spite of change and death's untimely rage And the long tempest of forgotten tears, The pain, the anger and the grief of years. XVIII Nor were the rest astonished. Even he, Natalia's lord, in all complacent grace Looked on approving of her act when she Stepped forward with her face to Adrian's face, And touched his lips and told him of the truth How all was ended now of her old life, With the sad barrier that had marred their youth: Husband no longer and no longer wife, Natalia had grown free. Then the proud lover Gave thanks to God and took her arm in his, Fearless how now their love they should discover To any anger of suspicious eyes, And led her forth his bride before them all With solemn music to the banquet-hall. XIX And still the music sounded near and near, Loud and more loud on Adrian's nuptial way, Preluding soft, as 'twere a dulcimer, But gathering strength and volume with delay, And sadness too. In truth, as strange a chaunt As ever bridegroom's ear might choose to know, Or lover's voice to listening lover vaunt, (Thus Adrian argued in his dream) for, lo, The dirge resolved itself to words of pain, And “Miserere mei Domine” Became the burden of its dolorous strain, Till the love faded from Natalia's glee, And with a sudden shudder in the sun Adrian awoke and his brave dream was done. XX Oh, pitiful awaking! What was Adrian's pleasure, That it had earned for him such bitterness? What his soul's pride that its new tender measure Should find its echo in a dirge like this? The chaunters chaunting slow were sable priests Robed for a requiem; the laughters clear, Women that wept; the untasted marriage feasts, Death's banquet spread, and she upon the bier, Natalia's self in her white robe of death, Mourned by the hard eyes of unfriendly men, And with them he, her husband, with set teeth And visage pale which ne'er should smile again In any welcome. Adrian neither moved Nor spoke, but gazed upon the form he loved. XXI But when they had gone past him every one, With new resolve begotten of his dream, Adrian arose and followed where the stone Yawned for his love, and there unseen by them In the dark chauntry he beheld them lay Her body in the grave with his own heart. A bitter jest it seemed to him that they Should all stand near and only he apart, And through his soul a wind of anger swept When any in the sad crowd chanced to be Betwixt him and the woman he so wept, And oftentimes he cursed them bitterly That hands not his should touch her in the tomb, Waiting till night and his revenge should come. XXII The thought of night consoled him. To his vision Natalia was dead only in false death, The sleeping treason of some false misprision, Some silent mystery of shortened breath, Not dead in truth for ever and to him, Or to that other life his dream foretold:— Her murderers these. And in his heart the whim Rose he should draw her from her cincture cold, And set his lips upon her lips once more, And free her spirit thus from its dull trance, And all should be between them as before, Only more dear for her deliverance. And darkly there he smiled as, their work done, The mourners left him with their dead alone. XXIII But, when the church was hushed in the night wind, And all were gone who might his zeal disclaim, Or hinder the firm purpose of his mind, A silent man among the tombs he came, Stooping to listen if so be some sound Of living thing with speech or power to breathe Should issuant be from the dark underground,— And last to hers. There on that home of death He kneeled him down and called aloud to her, “Natalia, O Natalia, my beloved, Am I not here thy soul's petitioner Whom thou so lovedst?” And around him moved The phantoms of the night. And the wind's sigh Answered his prayer, “Beloved, it is I.” XXIV And, feeling round him, lo, upon the mould A pick and spade cast down by accident. And Adrian laughed when in those engines cold He guessed the furtherers of his heart's intent. And all night through he wrought with them in rage, As miners do who know the prize at hand. Blest Adrian! Now thy lips thou shalt engage In the full solace thy long love has planned. Her face is near thee. Speed thee on thy task. Her breast's fair purity is thine to kiss. She shall not now deny though thou shouldst ask Her whole soul's prize in ransom of thy bliss. Thrice happy Adrian! See, thy hands have slid Trembling on thy Natalia's coffin lid. XXV Oh, miracle of love! That death, which seems So hard a master when he holds his prize, Whom no cajoleries, nor stratagems Of beauty's power, nor wisdom's sophistries, E'er turned aside from his appointed way, But falcon-like, who with relentless foot And pinions spread above his captured prey, Holds his high way in heaven absolute, Nor heeds our questionings: that this same death Should have grown soft and yielded to love's tears, And drawn his talons from their fleshly sheath, And spared awhile his harvest of the years! Oh, miracle in sooth renowned above All other wonders of miraculous love! XXVI Yet so it was. Adrian had hardly set His lips to those cold lips where death had been, His eyes those clammy eyelids scarce had wet With his warm tears and poured his soul between, Nor yet with eager hands had he undone That bosom's fastness of its snowy fold, Ere, lo, on his rapt ear there fell a moan As of one waking in the night grown cold. And, even as he held her in his arms, And gazed into her face by the dim light, He saw her blue eyes open in alarms, As wondering who was with her in the night, And a long shudder pass through all her frame, And her lips move as half she breathed his name. XXVII She wakes, she breathes, she rises from her bed, That bed of death where she has lain so long; The flowers they set there fall from her fair head Withered, while she, sweet soul, has known no wrong. Forth from her grave miraculously white, And all unstained by the dull earth's decay, Natalia rises, a last star of night, Just as the dawn is breaking into day. Upon the stones they kneeled them down and prayed, For hearts grow soft with a long danger past, And both were young and for a while dismayed At their great joy nor deemed they held it fast; Then, having kissed and wept, they turned to go Through the dark church with faltering steps and slow. XXVIII Away! Away! Away with her, young lover, Away with her in haste lest dawn should break; If that her kinsmen should thy deed discover Ill might it fare with thee for her love's sake. Away with her to thine own palace walls, Where thou shalt cherish her, and none may know. Thy grief alone in those sad funerals Was left behind and thou art quit of woe. Oh, happy bridal! Now let songs be sung, Lead forth the dances, let the minstrels play, Bring her thou lovest thy own kith among, A stranger bride, and who shall say thee nay? Death's mighty river whoso hath passed through Stands clear of blame, do fate what it may do. XXIX He bore her to his home 'twixt life and death, By mute connivance of the slumbering streets, Bore her redeemed to a new world of breath And peace divine, belike the Paraclete's. There lay she in his hands for many days Speechless, unasking,—only in her soul The wonder grew at love's mysterious ways Which had outwitted grief and proved her fool. Ay, fool in sooth, unblest by her own will, Yet now by chiding of love's guidance blest, Who, sparing all, of all now found her fill, And lost to love was now of love the guest. Dreaming she lay, with visions in her eyes Of a new world where women all were wise. XXX Thus was Natalia loved and lost and won. Some say that Adrian, having gained the goal Of his long hopes, and being of those who run Too lightly for their constancy of soul, Or finding maybe that in spite of fate She he had saved from death was ill at ease, And halted still in doubt 'twixt this and that, Grudging her frightened soul its ecstasies, At a high feast in presence of her kin Gave back Natalia to her husband's care: A fair resolve, mayhap, and lesser sin, If that sin be which love hath made so fair. Yet do I doubt me all so blindly ended, Since both from Adam were and Eve descended. XXXI Rather I hold with those that tell it thus, That they, who had made proof of their great faith, Were joined no less with honour in love's house By Holy Church, which binding looseneth, Since it is written that 'twixt maid and man The wedded contract joining hand and heart For this life is and passeth not the span Of victor death which all our bonds doth part. And it were grievous one should suffer all, Even death's last pang and an untimely grave, If overcoming he again should fall Prisoner to penance and to sorrow slave. Ah, no! They lived the life their love had given, And we too all, so grant it kindly Heaven! A NEW PILGRIMAGE A SONNET SEQUENCE 1887 I Care killed a cat, and I have cares at home, Which vex me nightly and disturb my bed. The things I love have all grown wearisome; The things that loved me are estranged or dead. I have a house most fair, but tenanted With shadows only, gardens of tall trees, Fenced in and made secure from every dread But this one terror, my soul's lack of ease. I have much wealth of pleasure, horse and hound, Woods broad for sport, and fields that are my own, With neighbours of good cheer to greet me round, And servants tried by whom my will is done. Here all things live at peace in this dear place, All but my pride, which goes companionless. II How shall I ransom me? The world without, Where once I lived in vain expense and noise, Say, shall it welcome me in this last rout, Back to its bosom of forgotten joys? Sometimes I hear it whispering with strange voice, Asking, “Are we forever then cast out, The things that helped thee once in thy annoys, That thou despairest? Nay, away with doubt! Take courage to thy heart to heal its woes. It still shall beat as wildly as a boy's.” This tempts me in the night-time, and I loose My soul to dalliance with youth's broken toys. Ay, wherefore suffer? In this question lies More than my soul can answer, and be wise. III I will break through my bondage. Let me be Homeless once more, a wanderer on the Earth, Marked with my soul's sole care for company, Like Cain, lest I do murder on my hearth. I ask not others' goods, nor wealth nor worth, Nor the world's kindness, which should comfort me, But to forget the story of my birth, And go forth naked of all name, but free. Where the flowers blow, there let me sit and dream. Where the rain falls, ah! leave my tears their way. Where men laugh loud, I too will join the hymn, And in God's congregation let me pray. Only alone—I ask this thing—alone, Where none may know me, or have ever known. IV Behold the deed is done. Here endeth all That bound my grief to its ancestral ways. I have passed out, as from a funeral, From my dead home, and in the great world's gaze Henceforth I stand, a pilgrim of new days, On the high road of life. Where I was thrall, See, I am master, being passionless; And, having nothing now, am lord of all. How glorious is the world! Its infinite grace Surprises me—and not as erst with fear, But as one meets a woman face to face, Loved once and unforgotten and still dear In certain moods and seasons. So to me The fair world smiles to-day, yet leaves me free. V The physical world itself is a fair thing For who has eyes to see or ears to hear. To-day I fled on my new freedom's wind, With the first swallows of the parting year, Southwards from England. At the Folkestone pier I left the burden of my sins behind, Noting how gay the noon was, and how clear The tide's fresh laughter rising to no wind. A hundred souls of men there with my own Smiled in that sunshine. 'Tis a little measure Makes glad the heart at sea, and not alone Do wise men kindle to its pulse of pleasure Here all alike, peers, pedlars, squires, and dames Forswore their griefs fog-born of Father Thames. VI Away from sorrow! Yes, indeed, away! Who said that care behind the horseman sits? The train to Paris, as it flies to-day, Whirls its bold rider clear of ague fits. Who stops for sorrows? Who for his lost wits, His vanished gold, his loves of yesterday, His vexed ambitions? See, the landscape flits Bright in his face, and fleeter far than they. Away! away! Our mother Earth is wide; And our poor lives and loves of what avail? All life is here; and here we sit astride On her broad back, with Hope's white wings for sail, In search of fortune and that glorious goal, Paris, the golden city of our soul. VII Ah, Paris, Paris! What an echo rings Still in those syllables of vain delight! What voice of what dead pleasures on what wings Of Mænad laughters pulsing through the night! How bravely her streets smile on me! How bright Her shops, her houses, fair sepulchral things, Stored with the sins of men forgotten quite, The loves of mountebanks, the lusts of kings! What message has she to me on this day Of my new life? Shall I, a pilgrim wan, Sit at her board and revel at her play, As in the days of old? Nay, this is done. It cannot be; and yet I love her well With her broad roads and pleasant paths to Hell. VIII I will sit down awhile in dalliance With my dead life, and dream that it is young. My earliest memories have their home in France, The chestnut woods of Bearn and streams among, Where first I learned to stammer the French tongue. Fair ancient France. No railroad insolence Had mixed her peoples then, and still men clung Each to his ways, and viewed the world askance. We, too, as exiles from our northern shore, Surveyed things sparsely; and my own child's scorn Remained, how long, a rebel to all lore Save its lost English, nor was quite o'erborne Till, as I swore I'd speak no French frog's word, I swore in French, and so laid down my sword. IX These were in truth brave days. From our high perch, The box-seat of our travelling chariot, then We children spied the world 'twas ours to search, And mocked like birds at manners and at men. What wonders we beheld, Havre, Rouen, Caen, The Norman caps, the Breton crowds in church, The loyal Loire, the valorous Vendéen, And all the Revolution left in lurch That very year—things old as Waterloo. But when we neared the mountains crowned with snows, And heard the torrents roar, our wonder grew Over our wit, and a new pleasure rose Wild in our hearts, and stopped our tongues with dread, The sense of death and beauty overhead. X Whence is our pleasure in things beautiful? We are not born with it, we do not know, By instinct of the eye or natural rule, That naked rocks are fairest, or flowers blow Best in their clefts, or that the world of snow Has other glory than of cold and ice. From our mother's hand we viewed these things below Senseless as goats which browse a precipice, Till we were taught to know them. With what tears I con the lessons now I learned so well, Of mountain shapes, from those dead lips of hers; And as she spoke, behold, a miracle Proving her words,—for at our feet there grew, Beauty's last prodigy, a gentian blue. XI I have it still, a book with pages sewn Cross-wise in silk, and brimming with these flowers, Treasures we gathered there, long sere and brown, The ghosts of childhood's first undoubting hours, Of childhood in the mountains ere the powers Of wrong and pain had turned our joys to gall. That summer stands to me a tower of towers, To which my gladness clings in spite of all. There was one special wonder in the hills, A place where nets were hung from tree to tree For flights of pigeons. This beyond all else Touched my boy's fancy for its mystery, And for the men who, caged aloft on poles, Scared down the birds, as Satan scares men's souls. XII Dear royal France! I fix the happy year At forty-seven, because that Christmas-tide There passed through Pau the Duke of Montpensier, Fresh from his nuptials with his Spanish bride; And because I, unwilling, shared their pride, As youngest of the English children there, By offering flowers to the fair glorified Daughter of Bourbon standing on the stair— A point in history. When we came at last To this gay Paris I was doomed to love, There were already rumours of the blast That swept the Orleans songsters from their grove In flight to London, after Polignac And the true king, at their King Bourgeois' back. XIII And what strange sights have these threewindows seen, Mid bonnes and children, in the Tuileries! What flights of hero, Emperor and Queen, Since first I looked down from them, one of these! Here, with his Mornys and his Persignys, Louis Napoleon, the Prince President, Rode one December past us, on the breeze Of his new glory, bloodstained and intent. Later, I too my love's diplomacies Played at Eugenia's court,—blest Empress! Then How did men curse her with their Marseillaise, When the foe's horse was watered in her Seine, And the flames, lit for her last festival, Licked out her palace and its glories all. XIV To-day there is no cloud upon thy face, Paris, fair city of romance and doom! Thy memories do not grieve thee, and no trace Lives of their tears for us who after come. All is forgotten—thy high martyrdom, Thy rage, thy vows, thy vauntings, thy disgrace, With those who died for thee to beat of drum, And those who lived to see thee kingdomless. Indeed thou art a woman in thy mirths, A woman in thy griefs which leave thee young, A prudent virgin still, despite the births Of these sad prodigies thy bards have sung. What to thy whoredoms is a vanished throne? A chair where a fool sat, and he is gone! XV For thus it is. You flout at kings to-day. To-morrow in your pride you shall stoop low To a new tyrant who shall come your way, And serve him meekly with mock-serious brow, While the world laughs. I shall not laugh at you. Your Bourbon, Bonaparte or Boulanger Are foils to your own part of ingénue Which moves me most, the moral of your play. You have a mission in the world, to teach All pride its level. Poet, prince and clown, Each in your amorous arms has scaled the breach Of his own pleasure and the world's renown. Till with a yawn you turn, and from your bed Kick out your hero with his ass's head. XVI Gods, what a moral! Yet in vain I jest. The France which has been, and shall be again, Is the most serious, and perhaps the best, Of all the nations which have power with men. France only of the nations has this plain Thought in the world, to scorn hypocrisy, And by this token she shall purge the stain Of her sins yet, though these as scarlet be. Let her put off her folly! 'Tis a cloak Which hides her virtue. Let her foremost stand, The champion of all necks which feel the yoke, As once she stood sublime in every land. Let her forgo her Tonquins, and make good Her boast to man, of man's high brotherhood! XVII For lo! the nations, the imperial nations Of Europe, all imagine a vain thing, Sitting thus blindly in their generations, Serving an idol for their God and King. Blindly they rage together, worshipping Their lusts of cunning, and their lusts of gold; Trampling the hearts of all too weak to bring Alms to their Baal which is bought and sold. And lo! there is no refuge, none but Baal For man's best help, and the mute recreant earth Drinks in its children's blood, and hears their wail, And deals no vengeance on its last foul birth; And there is found no hand to ward or keep The weak from wrong, and Pity is asleep. XVIII Therefore do thou at least arise and warn, Not folded in thy mantle, a blind seer, But naked in thy anger, and new-born, As in the hour when thy voice sounded clear To the world's slaves, and tyrants quaked for fear. Thou hadst a message then, a word of scorn, First for thyself, thy own crimes' challenger, And next for those who withered in thy dawn. An hundred years have passed since that fair day, And still the world cries loud, in its desire, That right is wronged, and force alone has sway. What profit are they, thy guns' tongues of fire? Nay, leave to England her sad creed of gold; Plead thou Man's rights, clean-handed as of old. XIX Alas, that words like these should be but folly! Behold, the Boulevard mocks, and I mock too. Let us away and purge our melancholy With the last laughter at the Ambigu! Here all is real. Here glory's self is true Through each regime to its own mission holy Of plying still the world with something new To cure its ache, or nobly souled or lowly. One title Paris holds above the rest Untouched by time or fortune's change or frown, One temple of high fame, where she sits dressed In youth eternal, and mirth's myrtle crown, And where she writes, each night, with deathless hands, “To all the glories—of the stage—of France.” XX Enough, dear Paris! We have laughed together, 'Tis time that we should part, lest tears should come. I must fare on from winter and rough weather And the dark tempests chained within Time's womb. Southwards I go. Each footstep marks the tomb Of a dead pleasure. Melun, Fontainebleau,— How shall I name them with the ghosts that roam In their deserted streets of long ago? I will not stop to weep. Before me lie Lands larger in their purpose, and with dreams Peopled more purely; and to these I fly For ever from life's idler stratagems. France! thy white hand I kiss in suppliant guise, Too sad to love thee, and alas! too wise. XXI To Switzerland, the land of lakes and snow, And ancient freedom of ancestral type, And modern innkeepers, who cringe and bow, And venal echoes, and Pans paid to pipe! See, I am come. And here in vineyards, ripe With sweet white grapes, I will sit down and read Once more the loves of Rousseau, till I wipe My eyes in tenderness for names long dead. This is the birthplace of all sentiment, The fount of modern tears. These hills in me Stir what still lives of fancy reverent For Mother Nature. Here Time's minstrelsy Awoke, some century since, one sunny morn, To find Earth fortunate, and Man forlorn. XXII Unblest discovery of an age too real! They needed not the beauty of the Earth, Who held Heaven's hope for their supreme ideal, And found in worlds unseen a better birth. What to the eye of faith were the hills worth, The voiceless forests, the unpeopled coasts, The wildernesses void of sentient mirth? In death men praise thee not, Thou Lord of Hosts! But when faith faltered, when the hope grew dim, And Heaven was hid with phantoms of despair, And Man stood trembling on destruction's brim, Then turned he to the Earth, and found her fair; His home, his refuge, which no doubt could rob, A beauty throbbing to his own heart's throb. XXIII Voltaire and Rousseau, these were thy twin priests, Proud Mother Nature, on thy opening day. The first with bitter gibes perplexed the feasts Of thy high rival, and prepared the way; The other built thy shrine. 'Twas here, men say, De Warens lived, whose pleasure was the text Of the new gospel of the sons of clay, The latest born of time, by faith unvexed. Here for a century with reverent feet Pilgrims, oppressed with barrenness of soul, Toiled in their tears as to a Paraclete. On these white hills they heard Earth's thunders roll In sneers outpreaching the lost voice of God, And shouted “Ichabod, ay, Ichabod!” XXIV And here too I, the latest fool of Time, Sad child of doubt and passionate desires, Touched with all pity, yet in league with crime, Watched the red sunsets from the Alpine spires, And lit my poet's lamp with kindred fires, And dared to snatch my share of the sublime. There was one with me, master of the choirs Of eloquent thought, who listening to my rhyme, And seeing in me a soul set on things Not wholly base, although my need was sore, Bade me take courage and essay new wings. And thus it was I first beheld this shore, Mourning the loss yet half consoled of gain, The passionate pleader of youth's creed of pain. XXV And what brave life it was we lived that tide, Lived, or essayed to live—for who shall say Youth garners aught but its own dreams denied, Or handles what it hoped for yesterday? High prophets were we of the uncultured lay, Supremely scorning all that to our pride Seemed less than truth. Be truth the thing it may, Our Goddess she, deformed but deified. Prophets and poets of the Earth's last birth Revealed in ugliness, a blind despair, Only that we were young and of such worth As still can thrive upon life's leanest fare, And find in the world's turmoil its full quittance Of joy denied, however poor the pittance. XXVI Youth is all valiant. He and I together, Conscious of strength, and unreproved of wrong, Strained at the world's conventions as a tether Too weak to bind us, and burst forth in song. The backs of fools we scourged as with a thong, And falsehood stripped to its last borrowed feather, And vowed to fact what things to fact belong, And of the rest asked neither why nor whether. Gravely we triumphed in that Gorgon time, Unsexed for us at length thro' lack of faith, Our barren mistress, from whose womb sublime No beauty more should spring, but only death. Like birds we sang by some volcanic brink, Leaning on ugliness, and did not shrink. XXVII The poets, every one, have sung of passion. But which has sung of friendship, man with man? Love seeks its price, but friendship has a fashion Larger to give, and of less selfish plan. The world grows old. From Beersheba to Dan We find all barren, ruby lips grown ashen, Hearts hard with years—and only Jonathan Weeping with David o'er a ruined nation. Then in the depth of days and our despair, We count our treasures, if so be remain Some loving letters, rings and locks of hair. Nay, mourn not love. These only are not vain, Your manlier wounds, when in the front you stood, For a friend's sake and your sworn Brotherhood. XXVIII Yet it is pitiful how friendships die, Spite of our oaths eternal and high vows. Some fall through blight of tongues wagged secretly, Some through strifes loud in empty honour's house. Some vanish with fame got too glorious, And rapt to heaven in fiery chariots fly; And some are drowned in sloth and the carouse Of wedded joys and long love's tyranny. O ye, who with high-hearted valliance Deem truth eternal and youth's dreams divine, Keep ye from love and fame and the mischance Of other worship than the Muses nine. So haply shall you tread life's latest strand With a true brother still, and hand in hand. XXIX How strangely now I come, a man of sorrow, Nor yet such sorrow as youth dreamed of, blind, But life's last indigence which dares not borrow One garment more of Hope to cheat life's wind. The mountains which we loved have grown unkind, Nay, voiceless rather. Neither sound nor speech Is heard among them, nor the thought enshrined Of any deity man's tears may reach. If I should speak, what echo would there come, Of laughters lost, and dead unanswered prayers? The shadow of each valley is a tomb Filled with the dust of manifold despairs. “Here we once lived”: This motto on the door Of silence stands, shut fast for evermore. XXX 'Tis time I stepped from Horeb to the plain. Mountains, farewell. I need a heavier air. Youth's memories are not good for souls in pain, And each new age has its own meed of care. Farewell, sad Alps, you are my barrier Now to the North, and hold my passions slain For all life's vultures, as I downward fare To a new land of love which is not vain. How staid is Italy! No gardened rose Scattering its leaves is chaster than she is. No cloister stiller, no retreat more close. There is a tameness even in her seas On which white towns look down, as who should say, “Here wise men long have lived, and live to-day.” XXXI Yes, Italy is wise, a cultured prude, Stored with all maxims of a statelier age; These are her lessons for our northern blood, With its dark Saxon madness and Norse rage. With these she tempers us and renders sage, As long ago she stayed the barbarous flood Surging against her, and her heritage Snatched from the feet of that brute multitude. Calmly she waits us. What to her shall be Our fevers of to-day, who erewhile knew Cæsar's ambitions? What our pruriency, Who saw Rome sacked by the lewd Vandal crew? What our despair, who, while a world stood mute, Saw Henry kneel in tears at Peter's foot? XXXII To-day I was at Milan, in such thought As pilgrims bring who at faith's threshold stand, Still burdened with the sorrows they have brought, And vexed with stranger tongues in a strange land. And lo, this sign was given me. At my hand Hung that mysterious supper Vinci wrought With the sad twelve who were Christ's chosen band, A type of vows and courage come to nought. And, while I gazed, with a reproachful look The bread was broken and the wine was poured, And the disciples raised their hands and spoke, Each asking “Is it I? and I too? Lord!” And there was answered them this mournful cry: “All shall abandon me to-night.” So I. XXXIII So I, I am ashamed of my old life, Here in this saintly presence of days gone, Ashamed of my weak heart's unmeaning strife, Its loves, its lusts, its battles lost and won, And its long search of pleasure 'neath the sun, And its scant courage to endure the knife, And its vain longing for good deeds undone, Ending in bitter words with railing rife. I am unworthy, yet am comforted, As one who driving o'er long trackless roads Of brake and rock and briar with footsore steed And springless chariot, searching for vain gods, Finds the high-road before him, where at ease The old world plods the rut of centuries. XXXIV O fool! O false! I have abandoned Heaven, And sold my wealth for metal of base kind. O frail disciple of a fair creed given For human hope when all the world was blind! What was my profit? Freedom of the mind, A little pleasure of the years, some scars Of lusty youth, and some few thoughts enshrined In worthier record of my manhood's years. All else is loss, and unredeemed distress; The voiceful seasons uninvited come, And bring their tribute of new flowers, and pass: Only the reason of the world is dumb; Nor does God any more by word or sign Speak to our rebel hearts of things divine. XXXV At last I kneel in Rome, the bourne, the goal Of what a multitude of laden hearts! No pilgrim of them all a wearier soul Brought ever here, no master of dark arts A spirit vexed with more discordant parts, No beggar a scrip barer of all dole; No son, alas, steps sorer with the darts Of that rebellious sorrow, his sin's toll. I kneel and make an offering of my care And folly, and hurt reason. Who would not In this fair city be the fool of prayer? Who would not kneel, if only for the lot Of being born again—a soul forgiven, Clothed in new childhood and the light of Heaven? XXXVI The majesty of Rome to me is nought; The imperial story of her conquering car Touches me only with compassionate thought For the doomed nations faded by her star. Her palaces of Cæsars tombstones are For a whole world of freedoms vainly caught In her high fortune. Throned was she in war; By war she perished. So is justice wrought. A nobler Rome is here, which shall not die. She rose from the dead ashes of men's lust, And robed herself anew in chastity, And half redeemed man's heritage of dust. This Rome I fain would love, though darkly hid In mists of passion and desires scarce dead. XXXVII I will release my soul of argument. He that would love must follow with shut eyes. My reason of the years was discontent, My treasure for all hope a vain surmise. I will have done with wisdom's sophistries, Her insolence of wit. What man shall say He comfort takes in the short hour that dies, Because he knew it mortal yesterday? The tree of knowledge bears a bitter fruit. This is that other tree, whose branches hold Fair store of faith, peace, pity absolute, And deeds of virtue for a world grown cold. If by its fruits the tree of life be known, Here is a truth undreamed of Solomon. XXXVIII I saw one sitting on a kingly throne, A man of age, whom Time had touched with white; White were his brows, and white his vestment shone, And white the childhood of his lips with light, Only his eyes gleamed masterful and bright, Holding the secrets shut of worlds unknown, And in his hand the sceptre lay of might, To bind and loose all souls beneath the sun. Where is the manhood, where the Godhood here? The weak things of the world confound the wise. Here is all weakness, let us cast out fear. Here is all strength. Ah, screen me from those eyes, The terrible eyes of Him who sees unseen The thing that is, and shall be, and has been. XXXIX Ancient of days! What word is thy command To one befooled of wit and his own way? What counsel hast thou, and what chastening hand For a lost soul grown old in its dismay? What penance shall he do, what ransom pay, Of blood poured out for faith in a far land, What mute knee-service, weeping here to-day, In words of prayer no ear shall understand? Let him thy servant be, the least of all In the Lord's Courts, but near thy mysteries, To touch the crumbs which from thy table fall, Let him—. But lo, thou speakest: “Not with these Is God delighted. Get thee homeward hence. They need thee more who wait deliverance!” XL Here therefore ends my sad soul's pilgrimage, In tears for sin and half-redeemed desire. She was unworthy her high martyr's rage, Or to be wholly purified by fire. O Rome, thy ways are narrow and aspire Too straitly for the knees of this halt age, And, with the multitude, her forces tire, Even while she holds thee fast, her heritage. Path of sublime perfection upon Earth! Your's is it in the clamour of vain days To guard the calm eternal of Man's birth And like an eagle to renew his days. Give me your blessing, angels, ere I go, Angels that guard the bridge of Angelo. IN VINCULIS SONNETS WRITTEN IN AN IRISH PRISON 1888 CONDEMNED From Caiphas to Pilate I was sent, Who judged with unwashed hands a crime to me. Next came the sentence, and the soldiery Claimed me their prey. Without, the people rent With weeping voices the loud firmament. And through the night from town to town passed we Mid shouts and drums and stones hurled heavily By angry crowds on love and murder bent. And last the gaol.—What stillness in these doors! The silent turnkeys their last bolts have shot, And their steps die in the long corridors. I am alone. My tears run fast and hot. Dear Lord, for Thy grief's sake I kiss these floors Kneeling; then turn to sleep, dreams trouble not. AT THE GATE Naked I came into the world of pleasure, And naked come I to this house of pain. Here at the gate I lay down my life's treasure, My pride, my garments and my name with men. The world and I henceforth shall be as twain, No sound of me shall pierce for good or ill These walls of grief. Nor shall I hear the vain Laughter and tears of those who love me still. Within, what new life waits me! Little ease, Cold lying, hunger, nights of wakefulness, Harsh orders given, no voice to soothe or please, Poor thieves for friends, for books rules meaningless; This is the grave—nay, Hell. Yet, Lord of Might, Still in Thy light my spirit shall see light. HONOUR DISHONOURED Honoured I lived e'erwhile with honoured men In opulent state. My table nightly spread Found guests of worth, peer, priest and citizen, And poet crowned, and beauty garlanded. Nor these alone, for hunger too I fed, And many a lean tramp and sad Magdalen Passed from my doors less hard for sake of bread. Whom grudged I ever purse or hand or pen? To-night, unwelcomed at these gates of woe I stand with churls, and there is none to greet My weariness with smile or courtly show Nor, though I hunger long, to bring me meat. God! what a little accident of gold Fences our weakness from the wolves of old! HOW SHALL I BUILD How shall I build my temple to the Lord, Unworthy I, who am thus foul of heart? How shall I worship who no traitor word Know but of love to play a suppliant's part? How shall I pray, whose soul is as a mart, For thoughts unclean, whose tongue is as a sword Even for those it loves to wound and smart? Behold how little I can help Thee, Lord. The Temple I would build should be all white, Each stone the record of a blameless day; The souls that entered there should walk in light, Clothed in high chastity and wisely gay. Lord, here is darkness. Yet this heart unwise, Bruised in Thy service, take in sacrifice. A CONVENT WITHOUT GOD A prison is a convent without God. Poverty, Chastity, Obedience Its precepts are. In this austere abode None gather wealth of pleasure or of pence. Woman's light wit, the heart's concupiscence Are banished here. At the least warder's nod Thy neck shall bend in mute subservience. Nor yet for virtue—rather for the rod. Here a base turnkey novice-master is, Teaching humility. The matin bell Calls thee to toil, but little comforteth. None heed thy prayers or give the kiss of peace. Nathless, my soul, be valiant. Even in Hell Wisdom shall preach to thee of life and death. THE TWO VOICES There are two voices with me in the night, Easing my grief. The God of Israel saith, “I am the Lord thy God which vanquisheth. See that thou walk unswerving in my sight, So shall thy enemies thy footstool be. I will avenge.” Then wake I suddenly, And, as a man new armoured for the fight, I shout aloud against my enemy. Anon, another speaks, a voice of care With sorrow laden and akin to grief, “My son,” it saith, “What is my will with thee? The burden of my sorrows thou shalt share. With thieves thou too shalt be accounted thief, And in my kingdom thou shalt sup with me.” LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY Long have I searched the Earth for liberty In desert places and lands far abroad Where neither Kings nor constables should be, Nor any law of Man, alas, or God. Freedom, Equality and Brotherhood, These were my quarries which eternally Fled from my footsteps fast as I pursued, Sad phantoms of desire by land and sea. See, it is ended. Sick and overborne By foes and fools, and my long chase, I lie. Here, in these walls, with all life's souls forlorn Herded I wait,—and in my ears the cry, “Alas, poor brothers, equal in Man's scorn And free in God's good liberty to die.” A LESSON IN HUMILITY 'Tis time, my soul, thou shouldst be purged of pride. What men are these with thee, whose ill deeds done Make thee thus shrink from them and be denied? They are but as thou art, each mother's son A convict in transgression. Here is one, Sayest thou, who struck his fellow and he died. And yet he weeps hot tears. Do thy tears run? This other thieved, yet clasps Christ crucified. Where is thy greater virtue? Thinkest thou sin Is but crime's record on the judgment seat? Or must thou wait for death to be bowed down? Oh for a righteous reading which should join Thy deeds together in an accusing sheet, And leave thee if thou couldst, to face men's frown! THE COURT OF PENANCE Behold the Court of Penance. Four gaunt walls Shutting out all things but the upper heaven. Stone flags for floor, where daily from their stalls The human cattle in a circle driven Tread down their pathway to a mire uneven, Pale-faced, sad-eyed, and mute as funerals. Woe to the wretch whose weakness unforgiven Falters a moment in the track or falls! Yet is there consolation. Overhead The pigeons build and the loud jackdaws talk, And once in the wind's eye, like a ship moored, A sea-gull flew and I was comforted. Even here the heavens declare thy glory, Lord, And the free firmament thy handiwork. MITIGATIONS My prison has its pleasures. Every day At breakfast-time, spare meal of milk and bread, Sparrows come trooping in familiar way With head aside beseeching to be fed. A spider too for me has spun her thread Across the prison rules, and a brave mouse Watches in sympathy the warders' tread, These two my fellow-prisoners in the house. But about dusk in the rooms opposite I see lamps lighted, and upon the blind A shadow passes all the evening through. It is the gaoler's daughter fair and kind And full of pity (so I image it) Till the stars rise, and night begins anew. GOD IS MY WITNESS God knows, 'twas not with a fore-reasoned plan I left the easeful dwellings of my peace, And sought this combat with ungodly Man, And ceaseless still through years that do not cease Have warred with Powers and Principalities. My natural soul, e'er yet these strifes began, Was as a sister diligent to please And loving all, and most the human clan. God knows it. And he knows how the world's tear Touched me. And He is witness of my wrath, How it was kindled against murderers Who slew for gold, and how upon their path I met them. Since which day the World in arms Strikes at my life with angers and alarms. THE DEEDS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN There are wrongs done in the fair face of heaven Which cry aloud for vengeance, and shall cry; Loves beautiful in strength whose wit has striven Vainly with loss and man's inconstancy; Dead children's faces watched by souls that die; Pure streams defiled; fair forests idly riven; A nation suppliant in its agony Calling on justice, and no help is given. All these are pitiful. Yet, after tears, Come rest and sleep and calm forgetfulness, And God's good providence consoles the years. Only the coward heart which did not guess, The dreamer of brave deeds that might have been, Shall cureless ache with wounds for ever green. A DREAM OF GOOD To do some little good before I die; To wake some echoes to a loftier theme; To spend my life's last store of industry On thoughts less vain than Youth's discordant dream; To endow the world's grief with some counter-scheme Of logical hope which through all time should lighten The burden of men's sorrow and redeem Their faces' paleness from the tears that whiten; To take my place in the world's brotherhood As one prepared to suffer all its fate; To do and be undone for sake of good, And conquer rage by giving love for hate; That were a noble dream, and so to cease, Scorned by the proud but with the poor at peace. HER NAME LIBERTY I thought to do a deed of chivalry, An act of worth, which haply in her sight Who was my mistress should recorded be And of the nations. And, when thus the fight Faltered and men once bold with faces white Turned this and that way in excuse to flee, I only stood, and by the foeman's might Was overborne and mangled cruelly. Then crawled I to her feet, in whose dear cause I made this venture, and “Behold,” I said, “How I am wounded for thee in these wars.” But she, “Poor cripple, wouldst thou I should wed A limbless trunk?” and laughing turned from me. Yet was she fair, and her name “Liberty.” FAREWELL DARK GAOL Farewell, dark gaol. You hold some better hearts Than in this savage world I thought to find. I do not love you nor the fraudulent arts By which men tutor men to ways unkind. Your law is not my law, and yet my mind Remains your debtor. It has learned to see How dark a thing the earth would be and blind But for the light of human charity. I am your debtor thus and for the pang Which touched and chastened, and the nights of thought Which were my years of learning. See I hang Your image here, a glory all unsought, About my neck. Thus saints in symbol hold Their tools of death and darings manifold. I WILL SMILE NO MORE No, I will smile no more. If but for pride And the high record of these days of pain, I will not be as these, the uncrucified Who idly live and find life's pleasures vain. The garment of my lofe is rent in twain, Parted by love and pity. Some have died Of a less hurt than 'twas my luck to gain, And live with God, nor dare I be denied. No, I will smile no more. Love's touch of pleasure Shall be as tears to me, fair words as gall, The sun as blackness, friends as a false measure, And Spring's blithe pageant on this earthly ball, If it should brag, shall earn from me no praise But silence only to my end of days. LATER SONNETS LOVE IS BEST Dare all things for Love's sake, since love is best, Of Fate ask nothing, rather by your deeds Rebuke it for its niggard ways unblest, And trust to Love to shield you in your needs. Remember in the shade of the new years Only what Love has given. This shall be Daily your dole, a safeguard from your tears, Outwitting change and Time's inconstancy. —Knock loudly at Love's door. He is awake. Offer him roses. 'Tis his month of June. Watch all his ways. Do worship for his sake. Seek out his service. He shall serve you soon. Know this of Love, who fears not Fate's disaster Answers for both and is of Time the master. SHE SHALL NOT GUESS Even if I died no sound should tell it her. Death babbles, but the calm of her dear eyes In vain would ask, no tell-tale breath should stir The lips still treasuring a thought unwise. How vain my life has been in its disguise, Left unregarded, her least pensioner, Yielding to all, unasking even with sighs The dole of hope not Heaven could quite confer. —To-day behold me on this page her name Over my own inscribing, with no prayer, Nor daring even to kneel in my distress. What I have written in this candle's flame Shrinks ere 'tis finished, and the incensed air Bears but betrays it not. She shall not guess. ALL WHITE All white, all light, all beautiful she stands, Love in her eyes, a glory round her brows, Blanched as the lilies chaste in her chaste hands. Even so God's saints in their celestial house. Red only are her lips, ay, red as those Turned by the Queen, that happy day in France, As yet unkissed, to him who made his vows, Victor in fight, to her his soul's romance. Idly she stands in dreams.—Ah, Launcelot, Couldst thou but plead here haply and prevail, Touch her soft cheek, draw tears from her sweet eyes, Open her lips to passionate words unwise, Receive her true kiss 'neath thy coat of mail: In Love's name, I who love, should grudge it not. ALL WHITE CONTINUED Ah, beautiful sweet woman, made in vain, Since Launcelot is dead and only I, Alas for this new world of recreant men, Remain in age Love's creed to justify And prove his right to fools who would deny! Heaven's help shall win her, though she long hath been Child of a doubting Age. Or let me die At her dear feet, my Guenevere, my queen. —Ride therefore forth, my soul, on this last quest. Oblivion soon shall fold all in its arms. Love, if she love thee or love not. The loss Is hers, not thine, since each thing else is dross; Not thine, whom Heaven makes whole and no hurt harms, Even that of death, so thou have loved thy best. GRATITUDE If gratitude a poor man's virtue is, 'Tis one at least my sick soul can afford. Bankrupt I am of all youth's charities, But not of thanks. No. Thanks be to the Lord! Praise be, dear Lady of all grace, to you. You were my mediciner, my one sole friend, When the world spurned me from its retinue. And I am yours, your bond-slave to the end. —How shall I tell it you? There was a time When I was sordid in my unbelief, And mocked at all things less robust than crime, A convict in my prison-house of grief. But that is past. Your pity was the key Which sent me forth, a broken man, but free. O FOR A SOUL O for a soul surrendered of all guile! A plain white soul with nothing on it writ, No creed of mockery to make men smile, No boast of wisdom travestied as wit; Only a clean soul where the infinite Calm of the heavens, as on some tropic isle, Should have looked down and on the face of it, Inscribed in sunlight, “Nothing here was vile.” —Thus to my life I argue it to-day, Thus chide my heart its too long vanity, Its lawless strength, its insolence of play, Its ancient rage of storm-tossed chivalry. And yet, God wot, should Love's wind breathe my way, My heart would rise still, a tumultuous Sea. TO ONE IN A GARDEN If I were other than, alas, I am, A soul in strife, whom banded foemen vex, If toil were folly and good deeds a sham, And hydra wrong had shed its serpent necks, And life's dark problems could no more perplex, How sweet it were, forgotten of all blame, In that far garden which your summer decks To dream with you that grief was but a name. —Ay, dream! For waking which of us were wise To spell grief's epitaph? Some tears must be Even in the herald hour of your sunrise. And in the night? Ah, child, what misery, Think you, awaits us when life's flood-gates strain To the full deluge of the descending rain? TO ONE IN A HOSTILE CAMP How dare I, Juliet, in love's kindness be Your counsellor for these mad days of war, I, a sworn Montagu, to liberty Bound by all oaths which men least lightly swear? How shall I aid you, who enlisted are In a strange camp, 'neath a strange captaincy, Nor urge rebellion to that lurid star Which mocks the captive nations held in fee? —Nay, bid me not thus falsify my griefs. I cannot turn my creed nor change my King. Around me crumble my life's last beliefs, But in the wreck of faiths to faith I cling. Lo, this my message is, till Time shall die, “Though all abandon these, yet never I.” A RELAPSE I thought that I had done with fleshly things, That in the azure of high thought my soul Had learned to fly on less substantial wings To a new Heaven, a sublimer goal. I thought that I was wise beneath the cowl Of my dead hopes, beyond all power of Spring's Most eloquent music to again cajole, And that my service was the King of Kings. —But look, alas, how thoughtless thought can be, For to me thinking thus one ventured in Bearing a letter and I read your name. Then in an instant through my limbs a flame Of pleasure ran, and wrought such change in me That I was eager for all loveliest sin. AN AUTUMN SONNET These little presents of your tenderness, Although less grand a gift than was your love, Are dear to me in this October stress Of wind and war and whirling leaves above. They comfort my soul's Autumn, and they prove How little time can do, to ban or bless, How much ourselves. You willed the years should move Back in their cycle. And behold, love, this! —Now, therefore, let us mark this fortunate day, And use it for our feast day. Every year Let us, when winds are high and the leaves fall, Hold in this house our love's memorial, Sitting thus hand in hand. Still let me lay As in the happy days, ere leaves were sere, My head upon your lap and call you “dear.” FRIENDS I fell among the thieves awhile ago, Who beat and stripped me; and, thus used, If led For comfort to the arms of one I know Who is to me a sister, being wed To my heart's kinsman. But “Alas,” she said, “Your nakedness will bring our house to woe. Prithee begone.” She blushed and turned her head, And left me doubting with which foot to go. Friends in the street beheld me, old and new. The new friends nodded; but the older stepped In haste from my reproachful eyes and me. They feared a creditor for sympathy, And so they fled. One only of the crew, A harlot, stopped me, kissed my wounds and wept. THE PRE-ADAMITE WORLD Who shall declare the glory of the World, The natural World before Man's form was seen? Fair stainless planet through the heavens hurled, And clothed in garments of immortal green! What depths of forest girt her! What serene Pastures were hers for cattle numberless Owning no lord save her, their guileless queen, Dear Nature's self who ruled them but to bless! If there was war in Heaven, peace reigned on Earth. Not by disease did the world's life grow tame, But by the hand of God, in drought or dearth Or sudden palsy when the lion came. Death! who should fear him or his mercy sue, Whose last pang was the first each creature knew? A VISION OF FOLLY I saw one rushing madly in pursuit Of Liberty. With frenzied steps he strode. Old laws and customs with disdainful foot He spurned beneath him in a mire of blood. He stood before the wondering world a god, A king with Freedom for his spouse and queen. He felt his empire was divine and trod, As on a footstool, on the necks of men. Ruin awhile and havoc strewed his path. He had his day of glory and his fall. He stood once more upon his father's hearth, Sated with pride, and there in frenzy worse Wrought foul dishonour on that honoured hall, And left its walls forever with a curse. AMBITION I had ambition once. Like Solomon I asked for wisdom, deeming wisdom fair, And with much pains a little knowledge won Of Nature's cruelty and Man's despair, And mostly learned how vain such learnings were. Then in my grief I turned to happiness, And woman's love awhile was all my care, And I achieved some sorrow and some bliss, Till love rebelled. Then the mad lust of power Became my dream, to rule my fellow-men; And I too lorded it my little hour, And wrought for weal or woe with sword and pen, And wounded many, some, alas, my friends. Now I ask silence. My ambition ends. AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS Here our roads part. Go thou by thy green valley, Thy youth before thee and the river Nile. My path lies o'er the desert, and my galley Has rougher seas to plough (and days) the while. I know not what to offer you: a smile, A blessing, a farewell? I dare not dally Even with the thought of tears. 'Twas but a mile We walked together, and such things were folly. I will not hope, who have no faith in fate, That I shall you remember or you me Beyond to-morrow. Yet, perhaps the wind Blowing some morning through its Eastern gate May tell you of my fortune; and behind The Western star some evening I may see, As in a vision of far days more kind, Your dear eyes watching while the night grows blind. A WOMAN'S SONNETS I If the past year were offered me again, With choice of good and ill before me set. Should I be wiser for the bliss and pain And dare to choose that we had never met? Could I find heart those happy hours to miss, When love began unthought of and unspoke That first strange day when by a sudden kiss We knew each other's secret and awoke? Ah, no! not even to escape the smart Of that fell agony I underwent, Flying from thee and my own traitor heart, Till doubts and dreads and battlings overspent, I knew at last that thou or love or fate Had conquered and repentance was too late. II THE SAME CONTINUED Nay, dear one, ask me not to leave thee yet. Let me a little longer hold thy hand. Too soon it is to bid me to forget The joys I was so late to understand. The future holds but a blank face for me, The past is all confused with tears and grey, But the sweet present, while thy smiles I see, Is perfect sunlight, an unclouded day. Speak not of parting, not at least this hour, Though well I know Love cannot Time outlast. Let me grow wiser first and gain more power, More strength of will to deal with my dead past. Love me in silence still, one short hour's space: 'Tis all I ask of thee, this little grace. III THE SAME CONTINUED Where is the pride for which I once was blamed, My vanity which held its head so high? Who would believe them, seeing me thus tamed, Thus subject, here as at thy feet I lie, Pleading for love which now is all my life, Craving a word for memory's rage to keep, Asking a sign to still my inward strife, Petitioning a touch to soothe my sleep? Who would now guess them, as I kiss the ground On which the feet of him I love have trod, And bow before his voice whose least sweet sound Speaks louder to me than the voice of God; And knowing all the while that one dark day, Spite of my worship, thou wilt turn away? IV THE SAME CONTINUED Should ever the day come when this drear world Shall read the secret which so close I hold, Should taunts and jeers at my bowed head be hurled, And all my love and all my shame be told, I could not, as some doughtier women do, Fling jests and gold and live the scandal down, Nor, knowing all fame's bruitings to be true, Keep a proud face and brave the talk of town. I have no courage for such tricks and ways, No wish to flaunt a once well-honoured name. I have too dear a thought of earlier days, Too deep a dread of my deserved shame. So, when it comes, with one last suppliant cry For pardon from my wronged ones, I must die. V THE SAME CONTINUED Whate'er the cost to me, with this farewell, I shall not see thee, speak to thee again. If some on Earth must feel the pangs of Hell, Mine only be it who have earned my pain. No matter if my life be blank and dead, Bankrupt of pleasure: it is better so Than risk dishonour on a once loved head, Than link all loved ones with my own sole woe. I have no claim to bring grief's shade on these, To mix their pure life's waters with my wine, To vex the dead, dear dead, in their new peace With knowledge of my sin and great decline. For these I leave thee, and, though life be rent With the rude fight, think not I shall relent. VI THE SAME CONTINUED What have I lost? The faith I had that Right Must surely prove itself than Ill more strong. For see how little my poor prayers had might To save me, at the trial's pinch, from wrong. What have I lost? The truth of my proud eyes Scorning deceit. Behold me here to-day Leading a double life, at shifts with lies, And trembling lest each shadow should betray. No longer with my lost ones may I mourn, Who came to me in sleep and breathed soft words. Sleepless I lie and fearful and forlorn, With their love's edge still wounding like a sword's. In thy dear presence only I find rest. To thee alone naught needs to be confessed. VII THE SAME CONTINUED What have I gained? A little charity? I never more may dare to fling a stone At any weakness, nor make boast that I A better fence or fortitude had shown; Some learning? I in love's lore have grown wise, Plucked apples of the evil and the good, Made one short trespass into Paradise And known the full taste of forbidden food. But love, if it be gold, has much alloy, And I would gladly buy back ignorance, But for the thought which still is my heart's joy That once your life grew happier in my hands, That in your darkest and most troubled hour I had, like Jesse's son, a soothing power. VIII THE SAME CONTINUED I sue thee not for pity on my case. If I have sinned, the judgment has begun. My joy was but one day of all the days, And clouds have blotted it and hid the sun. Thou wert so much to me! But soon I knew How small a part could mine be in thy life, That all a woman may endure or do Counts little to her hero in the strife. I do not blame thee who deserved no blame; Thou hast so many worlds within thy ken. I staked my all upon a losing game, Knowing the nature and the needs of men, And knowing too how quickly pride is spent. With open eyes to Love and Death I went. IX THE SAME CONTINUED The day draws nigh, methinks, when I could stay Calm in thy presence with no dream of ill, When, having put all earthliness away, I could be near thee, touching thee, and still Feel no mad throbbing at my foolish heart, No sudden rising of unbidden tears, Could mark thee come and go, to meet our part, Without the gladness and without the fears. Have patience with me then for this short space. I shall be wise, but may not yet unmoved See a strange woman put into my place And happy in thy love, as I was loved: This were too much. Ah, let me not yet see The love-light in thine eyes, and not for me. X THE SAME CONTINUED Love, ere I go, forgive me each least wrong, Each trouble I unwittingly have wrought. My heart, my life, my tears to thee belong; Yet have I erred, maybe, through too fond thought. One sin, most certainly, I need to atone: The sin of loving thee while yet unwooed. Mine only was this wrong, this guilt alone. The woman tempted thee from ways of good. Forgive me too, ere thy dear pity cease, That I denied thee, vexed thee with delay, Sought my soul's coward shelter, not thy peace, And having won thee still awhile said nay. Forgive me this, that I too soon, too late, Too wholly gave a love disconsolate. XI THE SAME CONTINUED Wild words I write, and lettered in deep pain, To lay in your loved hand as love's farewell. It is the thought we shall not meet again Nerves me to write and my whole secret tell. For when I speak to you, you only jest, And laughing break the sentence with a kiss, Till my poor love is never quite confessed, Nor know you half its tears and tenderness. When the first darkness and the clouds began I hid it from you fearing your reproof; I would not vex your life's high aim and plan With my poor woman's woe, and held aloof. But now that all is ended, pride and shame, My tumults and my joys I may proclaim. XII THE SAME CONTINUED 'Tis ended truly, truly as was best. Love is a little thing, for one short day; You could not make it your life's only quest, Nor watch the poor corpse long in its decay. Go forth, dear, thou hast much to do on earth; In life's campaign there waits thee a great part, Much to be won and conquered of more worth Than this poor victory of a woman's heart. For me the daylight of my years is dim. I seek not gladness, yet shall find content In such small duties as are learned of Him Who bore all sorrows, till my youth is spent. Yet come what may to me of weal or woe, I love thee, bless thee, dear, where'er thou go. NIGHT ON OUR LIVES Night on our lives, ah me, how surely has it fallen! Be they who can deceived. I dare not look before. See, sad years, to your own; your little wealth long hoarded, How sore it was to win, how soon it perished all! Beauty, the one face loved, the pure eyes mine so worshipped, So true, so touching once, so tender in their dreams! Find me that hour again. I yield the rest uncounted, Urns for the dust of time, divine in her sole tears. —Unseen one! Unforgotten! Oh, if your eyes behold it By chance, this page revealed which trembling hides your name, Merged in the ultimate wreck of fame and meaner joys! Co-partner be with me in this my soul's last sorrow, Pearl of my hidden life, this grief, that not again Unspoiled love's rose shall blow, the dear love which was ours. HOW GREY THE WORLD WAS How grey the world was with its memories, How dark even this gay room where the motes run! How black these curtains, thick with murder cries, These chairs, this floor with things slain in the sun! 'Twas here I strangled love, a year ago, And hid it 'neath these pillows drenched in blood, As a mad mother her sweet babe of woe, Too strong to die, too fair, which shrieks aloud. How black and bare and bitter the world was Just yesterday! To-day, this room, dear Heaven, What laughters fill it! what light footsteps pass! See, the white chairs dance round me pleasure-driven, And these sad pillows, where I wept, blab out The news that you are here, in psalm and shout! MOONSTRUCK I have quarrelled with the Moon. I loved her once, As all boys love one face supremely fair. I had heard her praised, and I too, happy dunce, Let my tongue wag and made her my heart's prayer. My prayer! For what, great heaven? The midnight air Seemed trembling in her presence, and those nuns The worshipping host knelt round her, star and star, And sobbed “magnificat” in antiphons. She was my saint, queen, goddess. Then, one night, Another face I saw, which, not a god's, Moved me to dreams more sweet than reverence, And we were near our bliss, when from the clouds Her angry eyes looked down and drove us thence Moonstruck and blind and robbed of our delight. POUR QUI SAIT ATTENDRE All things, they say, come home to those that wait, Riches, power, fame, lost fortune, hope deferred, Health to our friends, ill hap to those we hate, Even love, that glorious paradisal bird, The woman unattained, whose thought has stirred Desire to its last chord importunate; All shall be ours (so runs the common word) If but our patience lag not on our fate. —O, indigent consoling, even if true! Crumbs for the hungry, who thus fasting live And die deceived in impotence of bliss! And we, the god-like fortune-favoured few, Full dowered of joy? What ransom shall we give, In thanks to Heaven, who did not wait to kiss? YOUTH AND KNOWLEDGE What price, child, shall I pay for your bright eyes (How large a debt!) the light they shed on me? What for your cheeks, so red in their surprise, Your lips, your hands, your maiden gestures free, Your fair brows crowned with grave nobility, All the delight which in your presence lies, The words unsaid, the deeds which dare not be, The dreams undreamed, my meed of Paradise? —Nay, I can pay naught; your poor bankrupt I, Since gold may not nor frankincense nor myrrh Serve my account nor any gift of kings. Yet be my wealth yours, joys that fools deny, Knowledge of life, love, power as presbyter, The wit to teach youth's zeal to use its wings. LE ROI EST MORT. VIVE LE ROI! Why wait for Arthur? He too long has slept. He shall not hear you—no, nor heed your moan, More than the wail of those fair Queens that kept Their watch for him what months in Avalon! He shall not wake for any mother's son Nor mother's daughter of them all in tears, His knights, his ladies. How then for this one, You the last blossom of our world's lost years? —Ah, let him sleep. For see how in the wood, Under the dead oak, green new saplings spring, How the thorn blossoms, while birds cry aloud In scorn of grief. And, Lady, by the rood! There rides a knight, new-armed and questing proud, Who shouts, “The king is dead. Long live the King!” LOVE RIDES DISGUISED What name is his, thy knight's? Nay, ask it not. If fate should hear thee, child, what griefs might come. Love rides disguised. He fears a counterplot For his own plot of joy in heathendom. Restrained he goes; a single rose-red plume Is all his badge. No blazon hath he wrought, Device nor sign; his motto “sum qui sum.” Silent is he of Court and Camelot. —Be wise, sweetheart, nor tempt time to mischance. Love at his own hour shall his whole face show. Oh, if thou hast not seen him, thou shalt see! Undo shalt thou his helm with thy blest hands, Nurse his tired head upon thy pitying knee. Then shall he tell all, and thou all shalt know. A GLORY GONE What is my thought of you, beloved one, Now you have passed from me and gone your ways? Glory is gone with you from stars and sun, And all wise meaning from the nights and days. There is no colour, no delight, no praise In the deep forest, where your dear eyes shone, Nor any dryad face with cheeks ablaze To paint the glades grown sere as Avalon. —What is my thought of you? No thought have I But just to weep the pity of lost things, Grieve with the wind, and rain tears with the rain. The sun may smile, who knows, in a blue sky, To-morrow? But to-day Hope's passionate wings Are folded and Love waits on only Pain. A DIGIT OF THE MOON This book is written for Man's ultimate need, A creed of joy sent down to the aged Earth From days of happier daring and more mirth To comfort and console all hearts that bleed. Here shall ye find how Love, that mastering weed Of tropic growth and paradisal power, Sprang in a night and found its fortunate hour And was fulfilled of glory, flower, fruit, seed, A wonder to the Forest.—O ye souls Of men and women, who on Time's whim wait Nor clutch her hem when Pleasure turns to flee! Read of these two, who ill content with doles Rose in their rage and gave assault to Fate And won their birth-fruit. Read. Nay, dare it ye! NEW THINGS ARE BEST What shall I tell you, child, in this new Sonnet? Life's art is to forget, and last year's sowing Cast in Time's furrow with the storm winds blowing Bears me a wild crop with strange fancies on it. Last year I wore your sole rose in my bonnet. This year—who knows—who, even the All-knowing, What to my vagrant heart, for its undoing, Of weeds shall blossom ere my tears atone it? —New Spring is in the air with new desirings; New wonders fructify Earth, Sea, and Heaven, And happy birds sing loud from a new nest. Ah, why then grieve Love's recreant aspirings, His last year's hopes, his vows forgot, forgiven? Child, be we comforted! New things are best. UNE FEUILLE MORTE Je rêve debout devant la porte Qui vient de se fermer sur moi. Je colle mes yeux en triste sorte Sur ce carré de sombre bois. Je tourne entre mes deux doigts Une fleur, une petite fleur; qu'importe? Elle était bien bleue autrefois. Ce n'est plus qu'une feuille morte. Pauvre fleur, la douleur t'enlaidit Les pétales mornes et pendues. Tu sens mauvais, tu noircis. Hélas fidèle, que fais-tu? Mourir! C'est vite prendre ton parti! Et moi donc, qui ai tant perdu? THREE PICTURES I have seen many things in many lands, And many sorrows known and many joys, And clutched at pleasure's cup with lawless hands, And drunk my fill of mirth and lust and noise, Nor spared to make of human hearts my toys, But fed with life the brute strength of my pride, As with a tribute of fair living boys The monstrous lord of Crete him satisfied. —But of all pictures laid up in my soul Are three most beautiful and passionate, The illumined margin of an ancient scroll, Which moraliseth pity, love and hate; And these, when she is sad, she doth unroll And on their common meaning meditate. THREE PICTURES CONTINUED The first, a woman, nobly limbed and fair, Standeth at sunset by a famed far sea. Red are her lips as Love's own kisses were, Yet speak they never though they smile on me. An old knight, next, and arméd cap-à-pie, Watcheth the slaughtered clay that was his heir. The winding-sheet is not more white than he, Hath sat since dawn and hath not shed a tear. The third a tortured bull about to die In the arena. No proud infidel E'er laid his dripping spears more scornfully In Spanish dust; for he too, ere he fell, Hath slain a man. Ah Christ! That murderous eye Burneth athirst like the red pit of Hell. FRIENDSHIP'S BLACK AND WHITE Romance is writ for me with many names Of fair loved faces, each page a design Blazoned and tinctured, this with saffron flames Enshrining fancy, that with opaline Rays of mad hopes, half sunlight, half moonshine, This last with the sole gold of passionate blames Enjoyed and harvested and made divine By Love's long memory far outlasting Fame's. —Leave it untouched, the rose-sweet manuscript. Youth lies asleep in it, its spellbound knight. Turn not the leaves lest he should wake dismayed. This page alone stands open, unequipped Of any hue save friendship's black and white, Named with one name that needs not be afraid. IN MEMORIAM W.M. &amp; E.B.J. Mad are we all, maids, men, young fools alike and old, All we that wander blind and want the with to dare. Dark through the world we go, dazed sheep, across life's wold, Edged from the flowers we loved by our herd's crook of care. Life? Have we lived it? No. We were not as these were, Intent, untiring souls who proved time till their death. Nay we were sluggards, all, how crazed in our despair Each day of their fame won here nobly witnesseth. —What is life's wealth? To do. Its loss? To dream and wait. Years vanish unfulfilled; but work achieved lives on. Not all Time's beauty died when these two fell asleep. Dear Madeline, if we grieve our own less strenuous fate, Heaven send us still this strength, this joy, now they are gone At least like these to love, even though mad fools we weep. TO A DISCIPLE OF WILLIAM MORRIS Stand fast by the ideal. Hero be, You in your youth, as he from youth to age. Dare to be last, least, in good modesty, Nor fret thy soul for speedier heritage. Even as he lived, live thou, laborious, sage, Yielding thy flower, leaf, fruitage seasonably, Content if but some beauty in Time's page Out of thy being spring and live through thee. Churl Fame shall grudge (ah, let it grudge!) thee glory. Knaves have earned that. Behold, the blossoming thorn Emblazoneth the hedge where fools made foray, Redeemeth their sad flouts and jibes forlorn. Ere thou shalt guess, the nightingale thy story Learning shall speak of thee and shame their scorn. TO A DEAD JOURNALIST The busy trade of life is over now, The intricate toil which was so hard for bread, The strife each day renewed 'neath this poor brow By this frail hand to be interpreted, The zeal, the forethought, the heart's wounds that bled, The anger roused, the stark blow answering blow, All that was centred in that aching head Of black necessity for weal or woe. —Its use, its purpose what? Nay, less than none, More blindly naught than even the dull clay Left on this bed, its corporal union done, Which we must shovel to its grave to-day. O soul of Man, thou pilgrim of distress Lost in Time's void! Thou wind of nothingness! THE ROWFANT CATALOGUE Friends had he many, neighbours next to none. Rowfant and Crabbet lay few fields apart. Each Sunday saw him here, his church drill done, Duly stroll in to talk of books and art, Entrapped, may-be, to share my modest tart, Roast fowl and claret, and an evening won In stealth from Sabbath bonds strange to his heart. Childlike he prized these truant bursts of fun. —Long years ago! It needs his wit to jog Old time to life. Yet I remember well Companioning him home to the hill's top Keen on his books, and how he paused to tell Eager the first news of this Catalogue. Reading it, see, the tears come and I stop. ON A GRAVE IN THE FOREST Hush, gentle stranger. Here lies one asleep In the tall grass whom we must not awaken. For see, the wildest winds hush here and keep Silence for her and not a leaf is shaken, Lest she should wake and find herself forsaken. Close to my feet aweary did she creep And slept, and she is sweetly still mistaken Deeming I stand by her and watch her sleep. —Hush, gentle stranger! One as gentle lies In this poor grave, and weep before you go For one who knew no weeping, yet abode Among our human sorrows and was wise With tenderer sympathy than tears can show, The gentlest kindliest creature made by God. ALFRED TENNYSON Tears, idle tears! Ah, who shall bid us weep, Now that thy lyre, O prophet, is unstrung? What voice shall rouse the dull world from its sleep And lead its requiem as when Grief was young, And thou in thy rapt youth, Time's bards among, Captured our ears, and we looked up and heard Spring's sweetest music on thy mourning tongue And knew thee for Pain's paradisal bird. We are alone without thee in our tears, Alone in our mute chauntings. Vows are vain To tell thee how we loved thee in those years Nor dream to look upon thy like again. We know not how to weep without thy aid, Since all that tears would tell thyself hast said. IRELAND'S VENGEANCE This is thy day, thy day of all the years. Ireland! The night of anger and mute gloom, Where thou didst sit, has vanished with thy tears. Thou shalt no longer weep in thy lone home The dead they slew for thee, or nurse thy doom, Or fan the smoking flax of thy desire Their hatred could not quench. Thy hour is come; And these, if they would reap, must reap in fire. —What shall thy vengeance be? In that long night Thou hast essayed thy wrath in many ways, Slaughter and havoc and Hell's deathless spite. They taught thee vengeance who thus schooled thy days,Taught all they knew, but not this one divine Vengeance, to love them. Be that vengeance thine! A PERFECT SONNET Oh, for a perfect sonnet of all time! Wild music, heralding immortal hopes, Strikes the bold prelude. To it from each clime, Like tropic birds on some green island slopes, Thoughts answering come, high metaphors, brave tropes, In ordered measure and majestic rhyme. And, presently, all hearts, kings', poets', popes', Throb to the truth of this new theme sublime. Anon 'tis reason speaks. A note of death Strengthens the symphony yet fraught with pain, And men seek meanings with abated breath, Vexing their souls,—till lo, once more, the strain Breaks through triumphant, and Love's master voice Thrills the last phrase and bids all joy rejoice. HE MAKES AN END What shall I tell you, dear, who have told all, What do, whose wish, whose will is manacled, What dare, whose duty at your festival Is but to light the candles round Love's bed? How can I sing to you uncomforted By any crumb of kindness Joy lets fall? Unsexed am I by service, heart and head. Nay, let me sleep and turn me to the wall. —Alas there is a day when all joy dies, Through stress of time and tears' thin nourishment And that dumb peace of Age which veils the end. Here am I come, and here I close my eyes, With what I may of dreams (they naught portend), Framing your face, the last before Love went. LATER LYRICS GHOST OF THE BEAUTIFUL PAST Ghost of the beautiful past, of the days long gone, of a queen, of a fair sweet woman. Ghost with the passionate eyes, how proud, yet not too proud to have wept, to have loved, since to love is human. Angel in fair white garments, with skirts of lawn, by the autumn wind on the pathway fluttered, Always close by the castle wall and about to speak. But the whisper dies on her lips unuttered. Yellow leaves deep strewn on the sward, dead leaves of a far-off glorious summer. Yea, the leaves of the roses she plucked, petal by petal, with beating heart, for him the delayed loved comer. Why doth she weep thus year on year? He hath tarried long, ah me, a thousand desolate years. Why doth she weep? She hath wept enough. For see, dark down in the gardens dim, a lake. It is filled with her tears. If I should ask her name, her title with men? But I need not ask it. I know it, alas, of old, though of old unspoken. Is there another name but one for that face divine, for those sad sweet lips, like a bow unbent, like a bent bow broken? No, it is none but her's, the Queen, the beloved of all, the beloved of one, when the Table Round was set in thy mead, Carleon. None but hers, who was Guenevere, when the trumpets blew and the knights full clad rode down to joust at noon, with their clamorous shout, “The Queen!” Doth she remember all, or is all forgotten, pennon proud and lance in rest, the thunder of hoofs and the light swift tread of the foremost runner? Dareth she raise her eyes, those passionate eyes, at the crowd that gazed? None of them all might meet her look, save he, her one true passionate knight, who adoring won her. Surely, surely, she seeth; she knoweth all; she is no lost vision of death. She hath still a smile deep hidden. She hath a name on her lips. She shall sigh, she shall speak, she shall move, when the light winds breathe from the Western Seas with the Spring that quickeneth. Oh, she shall laugh and sing, though the shadow of Death be a cloud behind her! Oh, she shall love! Though the dragon of grief keep watch, he shall sleep when the trees in the mead grow green, and awaking he shall not find her. Read me a sweeter meaning, O Lady, O thou whom I serve, of this pictured story. Read. Nay the tale is told. To it's truth I swear, by my sword, by my knightly faith, by the fame of the King and the Table Round, and the souls of the Saints in glory! LOVE IS MASTER STILL Since that it may not be, The thing my soul desires, And that Love's tenderer fires Are doomed to loss and Time's sterility, Ours be it this one day Flowers at Love's feet to lay, For Love is master still, or be we bond or free. We may not quite be blest. Time's treasure is too great, And ours too weak a fate, And Joy burns low, a sun-flame in the West. Night comes, the while we stand Forlornly hand in hand, And then the tears begin, the dreams that have no rest. Yet, since it may not be, And Love can not be wise, And in each other's eyes We still must seek Time's lost felicity, Ours be it this last day Flowers on Love's grave to lay, For Love is master still, or be we bond or free. A CHAUNT IN PRAISE How many hymns have I chaunted, Lady, in laud of thee, Each with a sigh for its burthen, tear for its antiphon? Love-songs are sweet in the morning. All things in praise of thee Evening and morning rejoice, intoning in unison. Noontide and night have I heard them, birds in the bulrushes, Ewes with their lambs in the pastures, winds in the wilderness, Doves as they light in the palm-tops, moans of the waterwheel, Eagles and ravens exulting, all speak the name of thee. Fair is thy face, as the first star seen in the western sky Robed in the rose of the sunset, pure in its loneliness. Angels look down from its windows, smile on the world of men, Near yet afar from their grieving. Thou too hast smiled on me. Crown me with bays, nay, with roses. What should I do with bays, Emblems of earthly ambition, I who but live for love? Earn me reward of the red rose, thine and love's laureate, Thus with the flower of thy kindness crowning my constancy. Deign to accept an allegiance due to thy royalty. Empires are thine. Be my kingdom here at thy kness to kneel. Not till thou speak will I raise me, turn to life's emptiness, Ashes and dust for my portion, O thou most pitiful! Verily grief is love's sister. Therefore I weave for thee Anthems of grief and of true love born of thy loveliness. Read and forget, and to-morrow, lo, where my path hath been, Eagles and ravens exulting scream from the wilderness. COUPLETS IN PRAISE Poet of love, I sing here my whole soul to you. Ah, might I all deeds dare, love would I prove to you. Make I at least your praise, chaplet of sunny verse, Each dear delight of your told to the universe. Let me your sweetnesses, O child, enumerate. All the proud wealth of you Love shall remunerate. “Glory to God,” I sigh each time I gaze at you. Eyes that have wept all night thrill in amaze at you. Night in your dark hair sleeps, caught in the net of it, Emblem how dear of dreams pure as the jet of it. Valiant joy crowns your brow, stainless its ivory. Incense your sweet lips breathe, rose-red their livery. Earth has no part in you. Yet do your eyes to-night Vanquish all Earth for me, wise in their wise delight. Evening and morning still watch your feet shod with dew, Answering praise and prayer, fearless, your God with you. Dare to delight our souls steeped in love's tenderness. Earn us a wage of joy saved from the wilderness. Lo, how my heart leaps up new life inheriting. Armed for the fight am I, all your praise meriting. Idly if I have lived, now am I glorious, Daring all deeds for you, yours and victorious. Empires shall bend and break; kingdoms shall crumble down. Wise men shall bow the knee; wise ones look humble down. You are the cause of it. Only your name it is Nerves me to fight the fight stern with life's vanities. Die! Ay, to die for you, foremost in rivalry, Heroes to dig my grave: that were true chivalry. All lovers there should sing, all who had wit any, Mourn me and weep with you. Here ends my litany. SONG: LOVE IN THE SUMMER HILLS 1 Love in the summer hills, With youth to mock at ills, And kisses sweet to cheat Our idle tears away. What else has Time in store, Till Life shall close the door? Still let me sing love's lore, Come sorrow when it may. 2 Rain on the weeping hills, With Death to end our ills, And only thought unsought To point our joys' decay. Oh Life is wounded sore And Grief's mad waters roar. Yet will I love once more To-day as yesterday. WHOM THE GODS LOVE Whom the gods love die young. Ah, do not doubt of it. Laura did well to die. Our loss was a gain for her, Ours who so loved her laughter, ours who at thought of it Shrink from a wound yet tender, wailing in vain for her. Full was her life, a well-spring, brimmed to the brink of it, Giving of its abundance alms to humanity. We, with our life's cup empty, paused there to drink of it, Rose with our souls ennobled, purged of their vanity. Which of us all but loved her, knelt to her, prayed to her? She was our queen, our Soul-saint, first in our Calendar. “Laura,” our lips breathed, “Laura,” vowing our aid to her, Each as her fame's proclaimer, champion and challenger. Which but might deem she loved him? Which, when she smiled on him, Nursed not for his consoling dreams of felicity? Which, in her eyes, read no hope, when like a child on him Turned she those orbs appealing masked in simplicity? Nay, there was none went wounded, even when “No” to him Came as the last sad answer ending his argument. “No?” 'Twas hope's affirmation, boding no woe to him, Rather a sweet postponing framed for encouragement. Why should he weep? He wept not. Dear was her way with him. Had she not given of all things more than he gave to her? Had not her lips poured plenty, wise words and gay with him? Why should his farewell falter, fool hands not wave to her? I too with these essayed love. I too my joy with her Sought in her wild girl's garden, idly, a censurer, Learned what the rest had learned there, deemed like a boy with her I too, that Laura loved me, kneeled my heart's venturer, Wooed her and went forth weeping, yet with her name for me Stored as a sweet remembrance deep in the heart of me, Grieving my day departed; still as high fame for me Chaunting it, each sad evening, proud as a part of me. Whom the gods love! Ay truly. Why should we mourn for her Dowered with all youth for portion, spared our infirmity? Nay, 'twere for her to pity us, the forlorn for her, Laughing her gay girl's laughter, glad through Eternity. WITH ETERNITY STANDING BY How shall I bid you good-bye, Dear, without tears? Only once in the years, The idle vanishing years, We met, with Eternity standing by, And loved, a little forgotten space, I for the sake of your beautiful face, You I hardly know how or why, Or whether you loved me indeed, alas, With Eternity standing by. We played our comedy parts, Scene after scene. You were to be my queen, My dear sweet comedy queen, I your lover and knave of hearts Who kissed your hand in the make-believe And looked for the bee in your royal sleeve, And stopped, because of the pain that smarts, The pangs that soften, the sighs that grieve, And the rest of the tragic parts. We did not know that we loved, Not at the first of it. That, ah that was the worst of it, The aching sorrowful worst of it, Not till I saw that your soul was moved At the sound of my voice, as in tears I read Of Guinevere and the days long dead, And the knights and ladies who lived and loved And went to their graves and were harvested. Then, ah then, it was proved. So I dare not bid you good-bye, Dear, without tears. Things there are in the years, The coming ominous years, All too sad for us not to cry. Other joys shall forgotten be, But not the pilgrimage made with me, The Severn's flood and the angry sky, And the love we talked of, which could not be With Eternity standing by. MY ONLY TITLE My only title to her grace Is her sad, too silent face; All my right to call her mine The twin tears that on it shine, Tears that tell of griefs long hid In the shadows of each lid, And of doubts that wound her sore Our twin lives shall meet no more. Nay, my right and title this, That she gave me one shy kiss 'Twixt the dawning and the day, Benediction on my way, When the vain world was asleep And no ear to hear us weep, And that once my fingers pressed The warm treasures of her breast, Just a moment, and the truth Learned of her close-hidden youth With its joys and sweetnesses Deep beyond all wit to guess, All but mine, and what might be Were she wholly joined with me. Such my title is and treasure, Such my glory beyond measure, Such my thought for the new years, Burdened with what doubts and fears, Yet one day to claim her mine. Here, beyond this shadowy Rhine, Far from her and journeying still, Feel I her young pulses thrill, Her warm body nestled close To my own with all its woes. And I know that some far hour I shall call to her with power, When the sun is fast in prison And the midnight stars have risen Clear and kind in a warm sky, And the shepherd's hour is nigh, In a language she shall heed, “Life is fleeting, love hath need. Time it is tears should not be. Come, my love, and dwell with me.” And I know that without stay, 'Twixt the dawning and the day, When the vain world is asleep And no ear to hear her weep, She shall dry her tears and come; And we too through Christendom And beyond this shadowy Rhine, With its fields of corn and wine, And the snow-clad Alps and Rome, And the blue sea capped with foam, And far-famed Constantinople With its domes of pearl and opal, And the sea of Marmora, Where the dolphins sport and play, And the utmost isles of Greece Guarding still their golden fleece, As when Paris to them came With his Helen all aflame On their glorious honeymoon; And so on from noon to noon Journeying still and still beyond, Fond as they and yet more fond, To the ancient tearless East Shall be borne as to a feast, And sit down there our lives long, With Love's silence for our song And Love's guile for our disguise, While I teach her to be wise. And my title to her grace Shall the smiles be on her face, Her blue eyes, where no tears be, Being wholly joined with me. SEA LAVENDER Lavender, sea lavender! Pale sweet flower how full of her! Flower discreet, with your priest's eyes Trained in all time's mysteries, Yet how chastely calmly sealed! Flower of passions unrevealed, Stainless eyes, but none the less Wise in life's most nakedness, With its inward hours of sin, Known to thee, and all therein; And how soul with soul found might, In the watches of the night, Cherishing an unseen joy, Man with woman, girl with boy, Under the sky's multitude, Till the pulsings of their blood Led them into ways unknown, Flesh of flesh and bone of bone Clasped in one, till doubt was over, And they went forth loved and lover Bride and groom to their new home. See, to-day to you I come, Flower of wisdom who know all, To your mute confessional, Wanting love and wanting her, (Lavender, sea lavender!) In a world where she is not, Mined with plot and counterplot Built against our happiness. You, who know her most, can guess What her thought is far from me, What soft wind of memory Fans her with a scent of pleasure, What sweet song in what sweet measure Trilled by birds when day was breaking And each tremulous throat awaking Strained to make its passion heard Louder there than other bird, While we listened, we too, straining Heart to heart, and watched the waning Moon fade slowly like a feather In the red East, close together, Near, how near, who now are far. Tell me what her fancies are. Does she love still? Does she cherish, In the waste of days that perish That one dawn, which cannot die? Nay, I know it, nor will I Doubt of love or doubt of her, (Lavender, sea lavender!) Since she knows and understands That my hands still hold her hands. DON JUAN'S GOOD-NIGHT (From the French) Teach me, gentle Leporello, Since you are so wise a fellow, How your master I may win. Leporello answers gaily Slip into his bed and way lay Him; anon he shall come in. Soon as he shall find you laid there Fresh and young, so sweet a maid there, He shall smile, and joyfully “I am hungry, Leporello, Bring us wine, good wine and mellow, Here is one would sup with me.” Wine then will I bring (not water), A feast fit for a king's daughter, Lay it out in the alcove, While my Lord with pleasant fancies Makes his court to you, romances Of your beauty and his love. Passion soon shall rise full blossom; He shall weep upon your bosom, Make you all his soul's display. He, in honour as a true man, Shall declare you the sole woman He has loved until to-day. At the last he shall possess you, And all night. Then with “God bless you” Turn to sleep, nor shall you know, Curtained in your silks and satins, How at dawn he was off “to matins.” His politeness called it so. But remember, from next morning You must quite forget the adorning Of to-night, or earn his curse. Gold is yours if you but ask it, Spain and Flanders in a basket. I am keeper of his purse. To console you be a forture Will not grudge. But to importune His more tenderness? Nay, Nay. A return to even your beauty Were too costly a Duke's duty, One his whole wealth could not pay. A STORM IN SUMMER Nature that day a woman was in weakness, A woman in her impotent high wrath. At the dawn we watched it, a low cloud half seen Under the sun; an innocent child's face It seemed to us rose-red and fringed with light Boding no hurt, a pure translucent cloud, Deep in the East where the Sun's disk began. We did not guess what strengths in it were pent, What terrors of rebellion. An hour more, And it had gathered volume and the form Of a dark mask, the she-wolf's of old Rome, The ears, the brow, the cold unpitying eyes, Through which gleams flashed. And, as we watched, the roll Of thunder from a red throat muttering Gave menace of the wild beast close at hand. Anon a wall of darkness in the South Black to the Zenith, and a far-off wail, The wind among the trees.—And then, behold, Flying before it a mad clamorous rout Of peewits, starlings, hawks, crows, dishwashers, Blackbirds and jays, by hundreds, scattering, While the Earth trembled holding as it were its breath; Till suddenly an answer from the ground, And the fields shook and a new mighty roar Crashed through the oaks, and in a pent-up flow The storm's rage broke in thunder overhead, And all the anger of the passionate heaven Burst into tears. JEWELLED OFFERING Jewelled offering bring I none, Jade or pearl or precious stone, Urn of crystal, bale of spice, Unguent culled in Paradise, Dye how deep of rainbow hue, Dust of gold from Cambalu, Ivory throne with sandal-wood Inlaid all and scented ood, Tent of silk whose tapestries Tell of tears in ladies' eyes, Heavenly tears, 'neath moon and star, Hopes that were and joys that are, Ambient ever in love's soul Armed with might and near the goal. Nought, alas, of these I bring. Necklace, chain, nor nuptial ring. No bold bridegroom I, to be Nerved to dreams of chivalry, Expedited at your word Earth's whole realm to win by sword, Daring all things, briar and brake, Dole and Death for your dear sake, Onward, upward, heavenward borne, (O thou rose without a thorn!) Rivalry in deeds to show, Rodomont or Romeo. Out, alas! Such love for us Outlawed is and vanitous. Time can touch it not nor cure. 'Tis an ill we must endure, Howsoever long our days, Howsoever rich in praise. Even in Heaven we may not win Ear for this too sweet a sin, And no angel voice shall say, “Ask it, souls, and have your way.” Be consoled then if I make But this rhyme for birthday's sake, Leaving love gifts all aside Light to him shall call you bride, Unacknowledged and untold, Useless as Utopian gold. Nonsense rhymes! Ah me, such sense Nesting bird to nestling lends, Trills of pale parental hue Tragic only because true. A WEDDING MARCH Clash your cymbals, maids, to-day. Chaunt the praise of Cynthia. You, her virgins, yokeless, free, Young Time's choice, his brides-to-be. Nymphs in white, who hand in hand Next to her high altar stand, Take your timbrels, strike your strings; Tune them to Love's clamourings. Heralds be of her your fairest, Her of rarities the rarest. Instant all her laud rehearse, Idol of your universe; And thus armed stand forth and say, “All is nought but Cynthia.” Clash your cymbals. Beat your drums. Cynthia in her glory comes, High with him whose duty is Her to lead to a new bliss. Ah, what fortune his to be Angel of her ecstasy! Red with roses Love's path lies, Rich in rainbows of surprise. They that tread it wiser are Than the wise kings with their star, Eve and morn who went pursuing Eve's old hopes to Time's undoing, Robbing Time of his vain wrath. Run to Love; take all he hath, Idle maids! Nay, shout and sing, In Love's praise new chorusing, Stintless this thrice happy day. Shout aloud for Cynthia! A CUCKOO SONG Crowns are for kings to wear, sad crowns of gold Over tired heads that ache, world-cares untold. Not on thy happy brows, sweet bird of summer, Set we such crowns to-day, thou Spring's new-comer. Take from us, rather, thou these our wild posies. April's and May's we bring, June's with its roses. Nay and love's Cuckoo flowers, O child of glory! Cuckoos thine own birds are; these be thy dowry. Eve of our heart's shut field, need is we grieve thee, Gone to a world more sweet where we must leave thee. Russet-clad nightingales, tired of our chaunting, Out in the dark we weep, our Queen-bird wanting. Such is the fate of birds. Soon as the Spring comes Vagrant they flit and fly. Lo! 'tis their King comes. Endeth our night plaint only when, through the wild wood, New born the day trips in, laughs as a child would. O, then we too will laugh, join in the gay chime, Run to thy marriage bells, birds of the day-time. MANY ARE CALLED Many are called, dear heart, to happiness, But few are chosen, even for a wild short year. Love calls us from our sleep, and we make stress To rise and greet him in a world austere With a sweet dawn, while blithe as chanticleer He carols his brave message, and we loosen The shutters of our grief to find him near. Many are called by Love, but few are chosen. Love's voice is truth. He speaks his messages In tones we dare not doubt, and we give ear As to a prophet of our wilderness, The glorious lord of a new hemisphere. And we run, we too, glorious, without fear, Like children on bright ice too thinly frozen, Gay to our doom. Ah me! The plunge was sheer. Many are called by Love, but few are chosen. Love chooses whom he will to ban or bless. My fate was a wild shepherd's on the drear Plains of wan hope, whose one-time shepherdess Was lost even in the winning, and whose cheer Has since been of the yellow leaf and sere, (Scorned is the rose-tree Time finds no last rose on) And silence claims him and the end is near. Many are called by Love, but few are chosen. Queen of my life! I do not love you less Because you choose not me to cast your woes on. It is enough for me you once said “Yes.” Many are called by Love, but few are chosen. JACINTHS AND JESSAMINES Jacinths and jessamines and jonquils sweet, All odorous pale flowers from Orient lands, No vain red roses strew I at thy feet, Emblems of grief and thee, with reverent hands. Mine is no madrigal of passionate joy, Or orison of aught less chaste than tears. Ruth on thy brow sits fairest. Its annoy Rends not thy beauty's raiment, nor the years. In thy shut lips what secrets! Who am I Should seek a sign at that dread sanctuary? AN INSCRIPTION At this fair oak table sat Whilom he our Laureate, Poet, handicraftsman, sage, Light of our Victorian age, William Morris, whose art's plan Laid its lines in ample span, Wrought it, trestle board and rib, With good help of Philip Webb, For an altar of carouse In his own home, the Red House. Thirty years and five here he Made good cheer and company, Feasting all with more than bread. Had men stored the things he said, Jests profound and foolings wise, Truths unliveried of lies, Basenesses chastised and set Like hounds slain beneath his feet, Knowledge prodigally poured, His best wine, at this free board; Nay, if but the crumbs he shed Nightly round of heart and head Gleaned had we, not this good hall Half the wonders might install, Wit's wealth lost, which now must sleep Dumb when we have ceased to weep. ASSASSINS Assassins find accomplices. Man's merit Has found him three, the hawk, the hound, the ferret. SONG: IF I FORGET THEE If I forget thee! How shall I forget thee? Sword of the mighty! Prince and Lord of War! Captive I bind me To the spears that blind me, Rage in my heart and love for evermore. If I forget thee! How shall I forget thee? Man the destroyer! Life that made mine move! They that come after Let them earn my laughter, Ay, but my anger, never, nor my love. If I forget thee! How should I forget thee? One man there is no woman dares despise. Hate him it may be, Wound him if the way be, Nay, but forget him? Not before she dies! TO NIMUE I had clean forgotten all, her face who had caused my trouble. Gone was she as a cloud, as a bird which passed in the wind, as a glittering stream-borne bubble, As a shadow set by a ship on the sea, where the sail looks down on its double. I had laid her face to the wall, on the shelf where my fancies sleep. I had laid my pain in its grave, in its rose-leaf passionless grave, with the things I had dared not keep. I had left it there. I had dried my tears. I had said, “Ah, why should I weep?” I will not be fooled by her, by the spell of her fair child's face. What is its meaning to me, who have seen, who have known, who have loved what miracle forms of grace? What are its innocent wiles, its smiles, its idle sweet girlishness? I will not love without love. I despise the ways of a fool. Let me prevail as of old, as lover, as lord, as king, or have done with Love's tyrant rule. I was born to command, not serve, not obey. No boy am I in Love's school. I have fled to the fields, the plains, the desert places of rest, To the forest's infinite smile, where the cushat calls from the trees and the yaffle has lined her nest, To the purple hills with the spray of the sea, when the wind blows loud from the west. I have done with her love and her, the wine-draughts of human pleasure. The voice of nature is best, the cradle song of the trees which is hymned to Time's stateliest measure, As once a boy in the woods I heard it and held it an exquisite treasure. I had clean forgotten all. I had sung to the indolent hills Songs of joy without grief, since grief is of human things the shadow of human ills. I sang aloud in my pride of song to the chime of the answering rills. And, behold, the whole world heard, the dull mad manridden Earth. And they cried, “A prophet hath risen, a sage with the heart of a child, a bard of no human birth, A soul that hath known nor pain, nor sin, a singer of infinite mirth.” And she too heard it and came. And she knew it was I grown wise. And she stood from the rest apart, and I watched her with pitying scorn, and then with a sad surprise, And last with a new sweet passionate joy, for I saw there were tears in her eyes. And she came and sat at my feet, as in days ere our grief began. And I saw her a woman grown. And I was a prophet no more, but a desolate voiceless man. And I clasped her fast in my arms in joy and kissed her tears as they ran. And I shall not be fooled by her, though her face is fair as a rose. And I shall not live without love, though the world should forget my songs and I should forget its woes, And the purple hills should forget the sea and the spray when the west wind blows. PARAPHRASES FROM THE FRENCH QUEEN MARY'S LETTER TO BOTHWELL Pitiful gods! Have pity on my passion. Teach me the road how I a certain proving Shall make to him I love of my great loving, My faith unchanged, nor plead it in fool's fashion. Ah, is he weary of too full possession, Of this poor body's zeal which naught denied him, Of a Queen's pride enthroned too near beside him, Her parliament of joy in too long session? Nay, but she held as naught for him her honour, Naught her friends' loyalty, their wrath her foemen. Less than as naught the proud eyes of her women, The load of a realm's anger laid upon her. If it might vantage him! Behold me dying, To prove my constancy, bequeathing all, Fame, fortune, faith, my life's memorial, The one son born to me, nor ought denying. Queen am I with no subjects. Subject I To my sole king. My country? 'Tis his pleasure. There would I reign, who find in it my treasure, For treasure-house his arms, and there would lie. Without those frontiers would I wander never. I am no vagrant to take ship and go. This is my haven. Whatso winds shall blow, They shall not tempt me to a new endeavour. And yet he doubteth! Lo, the proof I offer: Not tears, not prayers; a manlier test is mine. Let others plead in weakness; my soul's wine Has a strong logic which shall find no scoffer. She, thy right lady for her own pride's sake, Vowed thee obedience. 'Twas her debt of duty. I for my shame made free gift of my beauty, Holding it royaller to give than take. She to her profit bindeth thee her lover, Being thus mistress of thy wealth and name; I to my hurt, in peril of my fame, And dreading all men should my shame discover. She dreadeth nothing; I have lost my daring. She of her parents took thee proud to give; I in despite of mine, who still must live Fearing worse fortune through my too much caring. And thou believest her! Although she reapeth All her delight of thee, her place, her glory, Her noble name who had no name in story, (And I a queen!) Half of thy love she keepeth, Love which was mine! And in exchange for what? A girl's fool fancy for a boy aspirant. How should she love thee not, thou master tyrant, Her wedded lord, in room of that sad sot? Mad were she else, since thou of all art master, Supreme in valour, beauty and men's praise, Thee in whose light I live out all my days. How should I pity her her soul's disaster? When first you wooed her, it was she the colder, You the more fierce; your flame raged as a furnace, She shrank from you abashed at love's sweet harness, Raised a maid's finger as your zeal grew bolder. No pleasure took she in your strength. She doubted Naught of your constancy who least could care. Small joy she made for you of braided hair Or happy raiment, going meanly clouted. Why should she deck herself? Her heart no faster Beat, nor when even at death's door you lay. Calmly she watched you in that disarray, Nor trembled for you till Fate's fear had passed her. And she lamenteth now, and moan she maketh, Noting the petulance of her first folly, Waileth aloud in wifely melancholy, And blindeth thee with feint of that she lacketh. What tales are hers! What flatteries now she weaveth, In her false letters, as one more than I Vowed to thy worship in long constancy To a loved paramour! And he believeth! Lies all! tales taken from some alien rhymer Richer than she in words to cozen you. Her woes are painted every week anew On her green cheeks, each than the last sublimer. And you give faith to her, to me light credence, Though all my joy, my constancy is yours, A flame which needs no kindling and endures, Claiming its place by right of long precedence. Too plain, alas, it is you hold me lightly, Deem me with heart of wax, with words of wind, A woman indiscreet and all too kind To all the world, with a new lover nightly. This is your ill thought which the more inflames me, Humbling my pride, till I no longer crave More than a share to-day of that you gave So wholly yesterday. Your doubting shames me. To-day I ask but this, to do you reverence, To heap you worship and make full your fame, To work for you the building of your name Joined to my own. For this I bar our severance. It is for you I supplicate my fortune, My health restored, my strength, that you may learn The fullness of my love and sweet concern So dear to serve you. Thus do I importune; Since that no wish have I but still to merit Your life's companionship, who first of men Possessed my body though less wholly then My joy of heart which I of you inherit. How many tears for you have I not wasted, How much of anguish suffered and disgrace! That day I saw the blood flow on your face I knew you mine; 'twas my own death I tasted. A day that was the last of my high queenship, Of my life's honour held to-day in scorn, Of my friends' faith even here where I was born With those that nursed me or were near in kinship. To-day I put aside their tried alliance. Yours only do I seek, which shall sustain My woman's weakness and make strong my reign, And give meet answer to my foes' defiance. This my presumption is, my reckoning this is, The one desire of her who is your friend, Who would your mistress be to her life's end And serve you with her tenderest tendernesses, You who to her are as her soul's sole brother, A woman in subjection to your will, To live and die for you your servant still, You only of all men and not another. Take it, my heart, my life, my blood, my all, The pleasure of my days, my nights of anguish, The lovelessness of hours where lone I languish, And build them with me to a festival. For now my heart is palsied with long fearings Of this, of that, the fear lest you forget, Lest tales be told of me, lest snares be set To lure you from my arms to new endearings, Some pitiful sad accident of sorrow, Which may God shield us from with his good grace. My fears I write who cannot see your face Yet know my love as yesterday to-morrow. And so farewell. Nay answer not in censure. Be bountiful of praise nor count the cost. Learn that that man is king who dareth most, And his the victory who most shall venture. THE DESERT WIND I went with happy heart (how happy!) a while since Behind my camel flocks, Piping all day where the Nile pastures end And the white sand begins Among the rocks. The wheeling eagles mocked me high there from the skies, The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. I saw a lady pass, (what lady?) none could tell, Nor of her tribe nor race, Of Roum or Franjistan or Fars or Hind; None knew. But I knew well That her sweet face Had blossomed first within the gates of Paradise. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. Within a tasselled frame, rich wrought, she sat and sang A song of love so sweet, That beast and bird and serpent came behind, And lizard with shut fang And faltering feet. My flocks strayed after them, and I who heard likewise. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. Upon a camel tall (how tall!) she rode by me Enrobed in white and red, And veiled to her bright eyes in bands that bind But hide not all souls see; And on her head A crown entwined of wool with gold and various dyes. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. Out to the wilderness, all day, we followed her. By winding paths untrod, O'er rock and plain none knew nor I could find, Although my home was there; And still we rode. The creatures tired and stopped; but I went on with sighs. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. We came to a deep pool (how deep!) I knew of none In all that land accursed, A pool of waters clear with white shells lined, And there we lighted down And suaged our thirst, And bathed our weary limbs, we two without disguise. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. Upon the brink we sat (ah me!) alone, we two, In that fair empty place. I kissed her hands and told her all my mind, And dared her grace to sue, Her utter grace. And she with smiles said “yea” to my too blest surprise. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. Ah me, that night of stars, those bridal stars of heaven! Ah me, those eyes of hers, So sweet, so near, of that same starry kind, Which drank their light ungiven, (Poor blinded stars!) And left them dark as they have left me wise. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. How shall I tell it? All three months of happy love I lived with her, blest queen, Fed on sole joy and what God's care might send Of milk and treasure-trove Of sorrels green, And roots and tubers fine and samh which we made prize. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. Since when I search the Earth (sad Earth!) in vain to win Once more her wondrous voice, Which led me forth to doom and left me blind, Bereft of flocks and kin And homely joys, Of wife and children's love and to behold the skies. The red blast of the desert wind Hath seared mine eyes. DEATH IN A BALL-ROOM Oh many, many thus have died, alas, Children, poor things! The grave will have its prey. Some flowers must still be mown down with the grass, And in life's wild quadrille the dancers gay Must trample here and there a weak one in their way. Yes, thus it is. After the day the night, A night that has no waking. Who shall tell? A joyous crowd sits down to feast aright, But always some one guest, where all seemed well, Gets up and leaves his chair and hears the passing bell. I have seen many go; cheeks rosy pink, And blue eyes wide as if entranced with song, And forms so frail it seemed that on death's brink A bird had bent the branch to which it clung, So frail the body was, the tyrant soul so strong. One knew I who in her delirium Uttered a name which troubled all around, And then, like a lost chaunt for ever dumb, She left us, smiling. In her breast we found Some faded violets hid, by a blue ribbon bound. Poor flowers, poor souls, and only born to die; Fair fledglings torn untimely from their nest; Halcyons our Earth had borrowed from the sky For one short Spring, and then, as if confessed Unworthy that high charge, given back to Heaven's breast. Such have I known; and such, alas was one Whom now I picture sadly here. Her eyes Had gleams where April's fitful beauty shone. I know not why she heaved so many sighs. She was sixteen, perhaps, and cared not to be wise. Yet think not it was love that was her death. Love had no song for her of any tone. Her heart had never beat too fast for brerth. Though all men called her pretty, there was none To whisper that soft fable in her ear alone. No. It was dancing, dancing which she loved Beyond all else, that caused her thus to die. Her very dust, methinks, by night is moved When the pale moon beneath heaven's canopy Holds revel with the clouds in the quick-circling sky. Balls she adored. Each evening that she danced She thought three days and dreamed three nights of it, And visions brave where goblin partners pranced Beset her pillows, till she could not sit Still in her bed but she must rise and dance a bit. By night and day her fancy framed the sight Of scarves and flowers and ribbons bright as noon, And jewels gleaming with unearthly light, And skirts of gossamer in wild festoon, And lace like spiders' webs of spiders in the moon. When the ball opened, she was first to come With her proud father, honest gentleman. Like a little mouse she ran about the room. Oh how she frowned and rattled with her fan And beat her pretty foot, until the dance began! It did us good to see her dance. Her feet Twinkled like stars in a dark firmament. They moved so fast they made our pulses beat Lest those frail laces should be overspent And the white satin shoes be whirled away or rent. She was all movement, laughter, and mad joy. Child! How we followed her with our sad eyes, Forgetful of the fever and annoy And rush and dust and nameless miseries, The punishment of souls too proud or sad or wise. But she, borne off upon her pleasure's wing, Whirled round and round. She never stopped for breath. She seemed to drink the fiddler's fiddling in. She seemed to smell the flowers of every wreath, To dance with every step the dancers danced beneath. 'Twas joy to her to leap and bound along, To feel as though she had a thousand feet, To grow so giddy in the turning throng She knew not where she was. Her heart so beat She could not see the chairs to find herself a seat. Alas, alas that ever morn should come On such sweet nights! Alas that she must stand Those hours of woe in the chill waiting room. Oh, often ere the coach was at command, The dawn had touched her shoulders with its naked hand. 'Tis ever a sad waking the next day. No laughter now, but only a dull cough. The crumpled dresses have been put away. Pleasure is dead, and there stands Pleasure's scoff, Fever with cheeks all red and tongue all white and rough. She died at sixteen, happy, loved by all. Died as she left off dancing. All of us Wore mourning long in token of that ball. She died upon the threshold of the house In her white robe and wreath and sable-lined burnous. Death took her thus that she might ever be Dressed for new dancing. When she wakes again She shall be ready for Eternity, And, if in Heaven such raptures are not vain, Shall tread fair measures still to seraph angels' strain. THE TOAD O who shall tell us of the truth of things? The day was ending blood-red in the West After a storm. The sun had smelted down As in a furnace all the clouds to gold. Upon a cart track by a pool of rain, Dumbly with calm eyes fixed upon the heavens, A toad sat thinking. It was wretchedness That gazed on majesty. Ah, who shall tell The very truth of things, the hidden law Of pain and ugliness? Byzantium bred Growths of Augustuli, Great Rome her crimes, As Earth breeds flowers, the firmament its suns, And the toad too his crop of ulcerous sores. The leaves turned purple on the vermeil trees; The rain lay like a mirror in the ruts; The dying sun shook his last banners out; Birds sang in whispers, and the world grew dumb With the hush of evening and forgetfulness. Then too the toad forgot himself and all His daylight shame, as he looked out bright-eyed Into the sweet face of the coming night. For who shall tell? He too the accursed one Dreamt of a blessing. There is not a creature On whom the infinite heaven hath not smiled Wildly and tenderly; no thing impure Monstrous deformed and hideous but he holds The immensity of the starlight in his eyes. A priest came by and saw the unholy thing, And with his foot, even as his prayers he read, Trod it aside and shuddered and went on. A woman with a wild flower in her bosom Came next and at the eye's light mirrored there Aimed her umbrella point. Now he was old, And she was beautiful. Then home from school Ran four boys with young faces like the dawn. “I was a child, was weak, was pitiless”: Thus must each man relate who would begin The true tale of his life. A child hath all, Joy, laughter, mirth. He is drunk with life's delight. Hope's day-star breaketh in his innocent eyes. He hath a mother. He is just a boy, A little man who breathes the untrammelled air Clean-winded and clean-limbed, and he is free And the world loves him. Why should he not then For lack of sorrow strike the sorrowful? The toad dragged down the deep track of the road. It was the hour when from the hollows round Blue mists steal creeping low upon the fields. His wild heart sought the night. Just then the children Came on the fugitive and all together Cried “Let us kill him. We will punish him For being so ugly.” And at the word they laughed. (For children laugh when they do murder.) Then They thrust at him with sticks and where the eye Bulged from its socket made a ghastlier wound Opening his sores. The passers by looked on, And they too laughed. And then the night fell down Black on the blackness of his martyrdom Who was so dumb. And when the blood flowed out It was horrible blood. And he was horrible. That was his crime. And still along the lane The creature sprawled. One foot had been shorn away By a child's spade, and at each new blow aimed Its jaws foamed blood, poor damnéd suffering thing, Which even when the sun had soothed its hide Had skulked in holes. And the children mocked the more: “Wretch. Would you spit at us?” O strange child's heart! What rage is thine to pluck thus at the robe Of misery and taunt it with its pain? And so from clod to clod, from briar to briar, But breathing still, in his dull fear he fled Seeking a shelter from their tyrannous eyes. So mean a thing, it seemed Death shrank from him Refusing aid of his all pitying scythe. And the children followed on with rushes noosed To take him, but he slipped between their hands And fell, so chanced it, where the rut gaped deepest, Into a mire of mud; cool hiding place It was and refuge for his mangled limbs, And there he quaking lay. The anointing slime Soothed his hurt body like a sacrament, An extreme unction for his utter need. Nor yet was safety won. The children's eyes, Abominable eyes, were on him still With their hard mirth. “Is there no stone?” they cried, “To end him with? Here, Jeremiah, Jim, Lend us a hand.” And willing hands were lent. Once more, O child of Man! I ask it. Say What is the goal of thy desire? What aim Is thine? What target wouldst thou hit? What win? Say. Is it death or life? The stone was brought, A ponderous mass, broad as a paving flag, But light in his young hands that bore it in, Pride giving strength to lift, and the lust to kill. “You shall see what this will do,” the young giant cried. And all stood near expectant of the end. And then a new thing happened, a new chance. A coster's dray, drawn by an ancient ass, Passed down the lane. With creaking wheels it came And slow harsh jolts in the ruts. The ass was lean And stiff with age, spavined, with foundered feet, And dead to blows which rained on his dull hide. Each step he stumbled. He was near his home, After a long day's labour in the field, And began to scent his stable, while the cart Lagged in the ruts, or with shafts forward thrown Pressed his galled sides and thrust its load on him, At the downward slope where the lane left the hill, More than his strength. A mist was in his eyes And that dull stupor which foreshadows death. Thus the cart moved, its driver cursing loud, Its driven dumb, while the whip cracked in time. The ass was in his dreams beyond our thought, Plunged in those depths of soul where no man strays. And the children heard the cart upon the road. It gave them a new thought. And “Stop,” they cried, “Let the stone be. We shall have better sport Here with the wheels. This ass will do the thing.” And they stood aside and watched what next should come. And the cart drew near, its wheels sunk in the rut Where the toad lay, the ass with his dull eyes Fixed on the path before him, his head down Nosing the ground in apathy of thought. And the ass stopped. He, the sad slave of pain, Had seen the vision of a sadder slave Needing his pity, and being as it were the judge To save or slay he had been moved to grace; He had seen and understood. And, gathering up In a single act supreme of his poor weakness All that remained to him of combative pride, He made the grand refusal, mastering By his last strength the load which pressed on him With terrible connivance of the hill, And wrenched the cart wheel from its track of doom Spite of his tyrant's voice of blasphemy And its mad curses and his own huge pain, And so, the victory won, passed on his road. Then also was it that that child with the stone, He who now tells this story, from his hands Let the flag drop. A voice had cried to him Too loud for denial: “Fool. Be merciful.” O, wisdom of the witless! Law of pity Loud on the lips of pain! Nature's pure light Lightening the darkness of Man's gulfs of crime! Lessons of courage taught by coward hearts, Of joy by the joyless! Eyes that cannot weep Pleading with grief and pointing consolation! The eloquent call of one poor damnéd soul Preaching to souls elect, the beast to man! Know this: hours are there, twilight hours of grace, When, be he what he may, beast, bird or slave, Each living thing gets glimpses of God's heaven And knows himself own brother to the stars, Being one with these in ancestry of love, Kindred in kindness. Learn that this poor ass, Facing his pain rather than add to pain, Was master of his soul in verier deed Than Socrates was saint, than Plato sage. Who is the teacher here? O man of mind! Wouldst thou touch truth? The true truth in thee lies, Thy lack of light. Nay kneel, weep, pray, believe, Grovel on the Earth. She shall thy teacher be. A corner of their Heaven thou too shalt win When thou art dust with these. Then shalt thou too Get glimpses of their world's ingenuous dawn And purchase back thy soul's lost purity, The love that casts out fear and conquers pain, The link which binds its weak ones with its strong And equals all in one divine accord, The unknowing ass with the all-knowing God. QUATRAINS OF LIFE What has my youth been that I love it thus, Sad youth, to all but one grown tedious, Stale as the news which last week wearied us, Or a tired actor's tale told to an empty house? What did it bring me that I loved it, even With joy before it and that dream of Heaven, Boyhood's first rapture of requited bliss, What did it give? What ever has it given? 'Let me recount the value of my days, Call up each witness, mete out blame and praise, Set life itself before me as it was, And—for I love it—list to what it says. Oh, I will judge it fairly. Each old pleasure Shared with dead lips shall stand a separate treasure. Each untold grief, which now seems lesser pain, Shall here be weighed and argued of at leisure. I will not mark mere follies. These would make The count too large and in the telling take More tears than I can spare from seemlier themes To cure its laughter when my heart should ache. Only the griefs which are essential things, The bitter fruit which all experience brings; Nor only of crossed pleasures, but the creed Men learn who deal with nations and with kings. All shall be counted fairly, griefs and joys, Solely distinguishing 'twixt mirth and noise, The thing which was and that which falsely seemed, Pleasure and vanity, man's bliss and boy's. So I shall learn the reason of my trust In this poor life, these particles of dust Made sentient for a little while with tears, Till the great “may-be” ends for me in “must.” My childhood? Ah, my childhood! What of it Stripped of all fancy, bare of all conceit? Where is the infancy the poets sang? Which was the true and which the counterfeit? I see it now, alas, with eyes unsealed, That age of innocence too well revealed. The flowers I gathered—for I gathered flowers— Were not more vain than I in that far field. Self was my god, the self I most despise, Blind in its joys and swine-like gluttonies, The rule of the brute beast that in us is, Its heaven a kitchen and a gorge its prize. No other pleasures knew I but of sense, No other loves but lusts without pretence. Oh, childhood is but Nature unredeemed, Blind in desire, unshamed in ignorance. I was all vanity and greed, my hand Uncaring, as a panther's, whom it pained, My nurse, my sisters, the young birds my prey. I saw them grieve nor stopped to understand. My mother loved me. Did I love her? Yes, When I had need of her to soothe distress Or serve my wants. But when the need was by, Others were there more dear in idleness. These coaxed and flattered me. Their wit afforded Edge to my wit, and I would strut and lord it Among them a young god—for god I seemed— Or goose—for goose I was—they still encored it. Alas, poor mother! What a love was yours! How little profit of it all endures! What wasted vigils, what ill-omened prayers; What thankless thanks for what disastrous cures! Why did you bind yourself in such harsh fetter, To serve a heart so hard? It had been better Surely to take your rest through those long nights, Than watching on to leave me thus your debtor. I heard but heeded not her warning voice; I grudged her face its sadness in my joys, And when she looked at me I did not guess The secret of her sorrow and my loss. They told me she was dying, but my eyes Brimmed not with tears. I hardly felt surprise, Nay, rather anger at their trouble when I asked them “what it was one does who dies.” She threw her weak arms round me, and my face Pressed to her own in one supreme embrace; I felt her tears upon my cheeks all wet, And I was carried frightened from the place. I lost her thus who was indeed my all, Lost her with scarce a pang whom now I call Aloud to in the night a grieving man, Hoar in his sins, and only clasp the wall. This the beginning. Next my boyhood came, Childhood embittered, its brute joys the same, Only in place of kindness cruelty, For courage fear, and for vain-glory shame. Here now was none to flatter or to sue. My lords were of the many, I the few; These gave command nor heeded my vain prayers. It was their will, not mine, my hands must do. I was their slave. My body was the prey Of their rude sports, more savage still than they, My every sense the pastime of their whim, My soul a hunted thing by night and day. Pain was my portion, hunger, wakefulness, And cold more bitter still, and that distress Which is unnamed of tears that dare not fall, When the weak body grieves and none may guess. There was no place where I might lay my head, No refuge from the world which was my dread, No shrine inviolate for me from my foes, No corner quite my own, not even my bed. I would have changed then with the meanest thing Which has its home in the free fields in Spring, And makes its lair in the Earth's secret dells, Or hides in her dark womb by burrowing. I used to gaze into the depths of Earth, And watch the worms and beetles that have birth Under the stones secure from outer ills, And envy them their loneliness in mirth. One treasure had I, one thing that I loved, A snail with shell most delicately grooved, And a mute patient face which seemed to see, And horns which moved towards me as I moved. It was like me a creature full of fear, But happier far for its strong household gear, The living fortress on its back wherein Its griefs could shrink away and disappear. I kept it in a nest, the hollow bole Of a dead elm, and for its daily dole, And my own comfort in its luckier state, Brought it a lettuce I in secret stole. It waited for my coming each new noon, When from my fellows I could steal so soon, And there I fed it and arranged its cell, All through a single happy month of June. And then—ah, then—who even now shall tell, The terror of that moment, when with yell Of triumph on their prize they broke and me, And crushed it 'neath their heels, those hounds of Hell! Even yet the thought of it makes my blood rush Back to my temples with an angry flush; And for an instant, if Man's race could be Crushed with it, God forgive me, I would crush. Ay, God forgive me! 'Tis an evil thought, And thus it is that wrong on wrong is wrought, Vengeance on vengeance by a single deed Of violent ill or idleness untaught. Nay, rather let me love. I will not be Partner with Man even thus in cruelty For one least instant, though the prize should stand, Hate slain for ever and the Nations free. Thus for four years I lived of slaves the slave, Too weak to fight, too beaten to be brave. Who mocks at impotence and coward fear Knows little of the pangs mute creatures have. Yet wherefore grieve? Perhaps of all my days This is the thing I mostly need to praise, My chiefest treasure to have suffered wrong, For God is cunning in His works and ways. The sense of justice which He gives to Man Is his own suffering, and His pity's plan Man's own great need of pity which brims o'er In alms to Africa and Hindostan. And he who has not suffered nothing knows; Therefore I chide not at these ancient woes, But keep them as a lesson to my pride, Lest I should smite the meanest of my foes. And it is ended. Kindly Death drew near And warned them from me with his face of fear. I did not fear him, but the rest stood awed, As at the frown of some dread minister. I passed out of their sight, one living still, But dead to sense who knows not good or ill, Their blessings were the last thing that I heard In that dark house. I wish them only well. What next befell me was as some have found, Peace to their wounds upon a battle ground, Who sleep through days of pain and nights of fear, Conscious of nothing but their dream profound. My dream was of a convent with smooth floors, And whitewashed walls, a place of corridors, Where the wind blew in summer all day long, And a shut garden filled with altar flowers. Here lived in piety a score of men, Who, having found the world a place of pain, Or fearing it ere yet they knew it well, Sought in God's service their eternal gain. With these it was my privilege to be The pensioner of their great pity's fee, Nor favoured less for my dim soul's dark ways, Awhile 'twixt boyhood and maturity. My sorrow to their zeal was fruitful soil, My wounds their pride as needing wine and oil; All knowledge had they to redeem and save, Mirth, silence, prayer, and that best opiate, toil. The garden was my task. I learned to dig, To nail the fruit-trees, pear, and peach, and fig; To trim the grass plots and the box make good, And keep the gravel smooth from leaf or twig. Dear blessed garden! In this night of days I see it still with its fair formal face, Where even the flowers looked prim, as who should ask Pardon for beauty in so pure a place. This for the summer. But when winter fell, A gentler service called me from my cell, As suited to the frailty of my needs, To serve the mass and ring the chapel bell. Mine was the sacristy, the care of copes, Albs, censers, pyxes, gifts of kings and popes, Of lace and linen and the lamps which hung For ever lit with oil of human hopes. There on the altar steps, as one at home, I hourly knelt the servant of old Rome, And learned her ritual, and assuaged my soul With the high lessons of her martyrdom. Not seldom in those hours the dream was mine Of voices speaking and a call divine. God in all ages thus has shown to men His secret will, and I too sought a sign. The voice that called me was a voice of good. It spoke of feasts less vain than the world's food, And showed me my place set a guest for aye Of heavenly things in that calm brotherhood. Why did I shrink? What profit to my soul Has the world proved that I must yield it toll? What its ambitions that for these my zeal Turned backward then from its eternal goal? Yet thus it is. Our fallen human blood Is ever a mixed stream 'twixt bad and good; And mine, perhaps, worse mingled than the rest, Flowed in a baser, a more prurient flood. And so it might not be. There came a day When I must grasp my fate and choose my way, And when my will was weaker than a child's, And pride stood in rebellion and said nay. There in the garden, while the thrushes sang, I listened to his prayer with a mute pang. That man of God who argued with my soul, And still the vesper chorus rang and rang. Below us a pool lay with depths profound, And in its face I gazed as if to sound His reason's meaning, while the rain of grace Was shed on all things but my heart around. “For lo,” he said, “thus near us lies the end; A step—no more—may mar our lives or mend. This side a little, and Hell gapes for us; On that side Heaven holds out strong hands, a friend. “And he who fears is wise. Oh look,” he cried, “Here in this pool lies Death with its arms wide. Speak. Shall I buy you life at cost of mine? Nay; I would drown, though in my sin I died.” Thus Moses argued with his people, these Than I less stubborn and less hard to please. God on that night spoke loudly to my soul, And I refused Him—weeping—on my knees. Here my dream ended. From that hidden life I went out hungry to a world of strife, The world of pleasure, and with heart keen set For human joy as having felt the knife. What is the root of pleasure in Man's heart? The need to know made practical in part, The shaping of the thing the soul has dreamed, In gold or clay, with art or little art. Youth knows not how to fashion its own pleasure; It deals with Fortune without scale or measure. And so is cheated of the gold life holds, A treasure house of hope without the treasure. The need is there, as swallows need to fly, The strength of wing which longs for liberty; The courage of the soul which upward tends, And the eye's light, a truth which is no lie. Behind us the past sinks, too tedious night, Whose shadows brighter show the world of light. And who shall say that laughter is not good, When the blood pulses in the veins aright? An April morning with the birds awake; The sound of waters lapping by a lake; The scent of flowers, the rhyme of dancing feet; The breath of midnight with the heart aquake. These are the moods of pleasure. And no less The soul itself has need of wantonness. The thirst of knowledge fired not only Eve, And youth grieves still to guess and only guess. We ask for wisdom. Knowledge first of all Demands our vows from her high pedestal. We wish ourselves in act as wise as gods, Nor even in age dare quite our oath recall. The truth !—to hold the actual thing and be Bound by no law but hers and liberty. Such was my youth's ambition, the fruit fair And good for food of the forbidden tree. Two things I was resolved my soul should know; The physical meaning of the Earth below, With its dumb forces armed for good and ill, And its blind fires which in their cycles go; This, and the power of Love. Here doubly set, The riddle stood which holds life's alphabet. What of a very truth were God and Man? I dared not die till I had answered it. And first of God. What Quixote on what steed Of foundered folly urged to headlong speed, Ere chose his path more madly, or fell down Proner on life's least lenient stones to bleed? Striding my horse of reason with loose rein, I tilted at all shadows in disdain. To each eternal I my question put, “What art thou, for Man's pleasure or his pain?” The Maker I had worshipped, where was He, In the Earth's fields, or the circumfluent sea? The footsteps of His presence on the wind, How should I trace them through infinity? The huge world in its naked shape unclad, Mocked me with silence, as a thing gone mad. A brainless virgin, passionless and blind, Reeling through space, unsentient—yet how sad! The stars of heaven! Their voices once went out Through all a firmament in psalm and shout. What word have they to-night? Nay, Jesse's son Had only mocked in our new world of doubt. I searched them, and I numbered, and I came To numbers only, flame evolved of flame, Orb wheeled on orb, a meaningless machine, A handless clock without the maker's name. Where was my God the Father? Not in space, Which needs no god for glory or disgrace, Being itself eternal. He I sought Knew not the stars but smiled with human face. Darkly the night looked at me; darker still The inner Earth with its tumultuous will, Its legion of destroyers and destroyed, Its law of hunger and the need to kill. In this too was no god, or—monstrous thought— A god of endless wrong, of treason wrought Through countless ages still against the weak. Out on such truth if this be all it taught! Out on such reason! From that cave of dread Like one despoiled of thieves I naked fled, My thirst for knowledge slaked in bitterness, And Earth's blank riddle all too sternly read. What has my youth been that I love it thus? The love of Woman? Ah, thou virtuous Dear face of wisdom which first filled my heaven, How art thou fled from life's deserted house! I see thee pure and noble as a vision, Rapt in the joy of thy sublime derision Of all things base, yet tender to the pain Of him that loved thee spite of love's misprision. Joyous thou wert as a Spring morning filled With mirth of birds which strive and wive and build, A presence of all pleasure on the Earth Transformed through thee and with thy laughter thrilled. True were thy eyes and pitiful thy voice, The colour of thy cheeks how rare a choice, The smiling of thy lips how strangely dear When thy wit moved and made our souls rejoice! Few years thou countedst to thy wisdom's score, But more than mine and than thy pleasure more I deemed thee roof and crown of womanhood, Framed for all fame to blazon and adore. Why wert thou fashioned thus for Earth and Man, If only Heaven was to possess thy plan? Why wert thou beautiful as God to me, If only God should see thee and should scan? Oh, thou wert cruel in thy ignorance, Thou first beloved of my time's romance. The love within thee was a light of death, Set for a snare and luring to mischance. What didst thou think of him, the boy untried, To whom thou spakest of Heaven as speaks a bride? The love of Heaven! Alas, thou couldst not guess The fires he nursed or surely thou hadst lied. His secret springs of passion had no art, Nor loosed his tongue to any counterpart Of mastering words. You neither feared nor knew The rage of cursing hidden in his heart. If thou hadst seen it, wouldst thou not have said A soul by Satan tortured and misled? Thou didst not guess the truth, that in thy hand The scourges lay, the pincers, and the lead. Or haply didst thou love me? Not so heaven Possessed thee then but sometimes there were given Glimpses which, to my later eyes of light, Have shown new worlds as if by lightnings riven. How had it been if I had ventured quite That first enchanted, unforgotten night, When I surprised thee weeping and in fear Forbore the wrong that should have proved me right? How had it been if youth had been less weak, And love's mute hand had found the wit to speak. If thou hadst been less valiant in thy tears, And I had touched the heaven which was thy cheek? Would life have been to me what now it is, A thing of dreams half wise and half unwise, A web unpatterned where each idler's hand Has woven his thoughts, flowers, scrolls, and butterflies? Or rather, had it not, redeemed of bliss, Grasped at new worlds less impotent than this, And made of love a heaven? for depths of fate Lie in the issue of a woman's kiss. Alas, it was not, and it may not be Now, though the sun were melted in the sea, And though thou livedst, and though I still should live, Searching thy soul through all Eternity. The ideal love, how fondly it gives place To loves all real—alas, and flavourless. The heart in hunger needs its meat to live, And takes what dole it finds of happiness. Then are strange spectacles of treason seen, Earthquakes and tempests and the wars of men, Shipwrecks of faith, ungodly interludes And pagan rites to Moloch on the green. Lust travestied as love goes nightly forth, Preaching its creed unclean from South to North, Using the very gestures of true love, Its words, its prayers, its vows—how little worth! Where are ye now, ye poor unfortunates, Who once my partners were in these mad gaits, Sad souls of women half unsexed by shame, In what dire clutches of what felon fates? Dark-eyed I see her, her who caused my fall, Nay, caused it not who knew it not at all. I hear her babble her fool's creed of bliss, While I lie mute, a swine-like prodigal. Her chamber redolent of unctuous glooms Prisons me yet with its profane perfumes, A cell of follies used and cast aside, Painted in pleasure's likeness—and a tomb's. Oh, those dead flowers upon her table set, How loud they preach to me of wisdom yet, Poor slaughtered innocents there parched in Hell, Which Heaven had seen at dawn with dewdrops wet! Littered they lay, those maidenheads of saints, Mid pots of fard and powder-puffs and paints, Egregious relics of lost purity Tortured on wires with all that mars and taints. Beneath, upon the floor her slippers lay Who was the queen of all that disarray, Left where she dropped them when she fled the room To speed her latest gallant on his way. The pictures on the wall—by what strange chance— Showed sacred scenes of Biblical romance; Among them Pilate on his judgment-seat Washing before the multitude his hands. Smiling he sat while in reproachful mood He they led forth to crucifixion stood. “Innocent am I,” thus the legend ran Inscribed beneath it, “of this just One's blood.” Innocent! Ah, the sad forgotten thought Of that mute face my convent dreams had sought. And while I sighed, behold the arms of sin In my own arms enlatticed and enwrought. A life of pleasure is a misnamed thing, Soulless at best, an insect on the wing, But mostly sad with its unconquered griefs, The noise that frets, the vanities that sting. The weapons of youth's armoury are these— The chase, the dance, the gambler's ecstasies. Each in its turn I handled with the rest,And drained my cup of folly to the lees. What days I murdered thus without design, What nights deflowered in madness and lewd wine! The ghosts of those lost hours are with me still, Crying, “Give back my life, and mine, and mine!” Yet was it glorious on the scented morn To wake the woods with clamouring hound and horn, To ride red-coated where the red fox ran, And shout with those who laughed to see him torn. Glorious to lie 'neath the tall reeds in wait For the swift fowl at flight returning late, And pull them from their path with lightning shot, The bolt of Jove less certain in its fate. Glorious to battle with the crested wave For the full nets engulphed in the sea's grave, And see the fishes flash entangled there, With only courage and strong arms to save. And glorious more, with sword high-poised and still, To meet the bull's rush with o'ermastering skill, And watch the stricken mass in anger die, Tamed by the potency of human will. All glorious and vain-glorious and most sad, Because of the dark death their doing made, And of the nothingness that swept the track, Leaving no footprint or of good or bad. The light-heeled love of laughter and the dance Held me, yet held not, in its transient trance. The hours were few when, fired with love and wine, I trod the Bacchanalian maze of France. Yet do I mind me of one afternoon In Meudon wood, when night came all too soon; And then again the morning, and unstayed We pranced our measure out from noon to noon. That day of dancing in my memory stands A thing apart and almost of romance, A day of pleasure physical and strong, Unwearied and unwearying, feet, lips, hands. The “Coq de Bruyère” was the fortunate sign Of the lone inn where we had met to dine, And found a score companions light as we To turn our rustic hostel to a shrine. If it still stands, how strangely it must view This older world with hopes of paler hue! Or was it youth so painted the grass green, The apple-blossoms pink, the heavens blue? Alas! I know not, nor remember yet Her name with whom those foolish hours seemed sweet, Only that she laughed on and danced with me, And that my fingers just could span her feet. How far away! And Meudon, too, how far! And all those souls of women lost in care, And even fair France herself how merged in pain! It was the Spring before the Prussian war. One day, one only day, and then the light Waned in the place and hid our faces white, And, our score paid, we left the empty room And met no more on this side of the night. Who speaks of play speaks treason to youth's state. Youth is the heir to passion, love and hate, The passion of the body in its strength, The passion of the soul commensurate. Nought needs it in its force of whip or goad, Say rather a strong bridle for the road. He who would spur it to a fiercer heat Is an ill rider whom no fortunes bode. Shame is it that the glory of youth's eyes Should be lack-lustred with the grape's disguise, And doubly shame its vast desires should swoon In maniac clutchings at a vagrant prize. Gold is the last least noble stake of life, When all is gone, friends, fashion, fame, love's strife, The thing men still can chase when dotage stings And joy is dead and gout is as the knife. Youth, seeking gold at Fortune's hand, goes bare Of its best weapons with the humblest there, As impotent to win a smile from fate As the least valiant, the most cursed with care. Watch well the doors of Fortune. Who goes in? The prince, the peasant, the gay child of sin, The red-cheeked soldier, the mad crook-backed crone, Which shall prevail with Fortune? Which shall win? Nay, who shall tell? Luck levels all pretence, Manhood's high pride, youth's first concupiscence. The arbiter of fame it stands and wit, The judge supreme of sense and lack of sense. The gambler's heaven is Youth's untimely Hell. And I, who dwelt there as lost spirits dwell, There touched the bottom of the pit. Even yet I dare not nakedly its secrets tell. What saved me from the gulf? All ye who preach Art the physician and consoling leech Of fallen souls, if but a single spark Of genius lives, behold the text you teach. In Art's high hall for whoso holds the key Honour does service on a suppliant knee, Virtue his handmaid is, to work his will, And beauty crowns him, be he bond or free. His sad soul's raiment from his shoulders fall, Light pure is given, and he is clothed withal, His eye grows single and his madness parts As once in song the raging mood of Saul. What saved me from the gulf? Thrice generous hand, A king's in gifts, a prophet's in command, All potent intellect designed to guide, Transforming grief as with a master's wand! This life, if it be worthy grown, is thine; These tears made sweet once bitter with such brine, This impotence of will to purpose fired, This death fenced out with mine and countermine. For I insensate had resolved to fly From life's despairs and sick pride's misery, A craven braggart to the arms of death, And die dishonoured as the wretched die. Thou stoodst, how oft, between me and my fate, Bidding me cheer, or, if I dared not, wait, From morn to night and then from night to morn Pointing to Fame as to an open gate; Till Time, the healer, had half closed the wound, And Spring in the year's mercy came back crowned With leaves and blossoms, and I could not choose To lie unknown forgotten underground. If there be aught of pleasure worth the living 'Tis to be loved when trouble has done grieving, And the sick soul, resigned to her mute state, Forgets the pain forgiven and forgiving. With wan eyes set upon life's door ajar She waits half conscious of the rising star, And lo! 'tis Happiness on tip-toe comes With fruits and flowers and incense from afar. Scarcely she heeds him as he stops and smiles. She does not doubt his innocent lips' wiles. She lies in weakness wondering and half won, While beauty cunningly her sense beguiles. Then at her feet he sets his stores unrolled Of spice and gums and treasure manifold. All kingdoms of the Earth have tribute paid To heap the myrrh and frankincense and gold. These are his gifts, and tenderly he stands With eyes of reverence and mute folded hands, Pleading her grace, and lo! her heaven is filled With music as of archangelic bands. What saved me from the gulf? A woman's prayer Sublimely venturing all a soul might dare, A saint's high constancy outwitting Fate And dowered with love supreme in its despair. I had done naught to merit such high lot, Given naught in hostage and adventured naught. The gift was free as heaven's own copious rains, And came like these unseeking and unsought. O noble heart of woman! On life's sea Thou sailedst bravely, a proud argosy, Freighted with wisdom's wealth and ordered well, Defiant of all storms—since storms must be. On thy high way thou passedst pursuant only Of Virtue's purpose and Truth's instinct thronely. Strength's symbol wert thou, self-contained and free, Lone in thy path of good but never lonely. What glory of the morning lit thy shrouds! What pure thought limned thee white on thunder-clouds! I from my shattered raft afar in pain Kneeled to thy form and prayed across the floods. In godlike patience, to my soul's surprise, Thou paused and parleyed wise with me unwise. Ah, dearest soul seraphic! Who shall paint The heaven revealed of pity in thine eyes? She took me to her riches. All the gladness Of her great joy she gave to cure my sadness, All her soul's garment of unearthly hopes To ease the ache which fructified to madness. She took me to her pleasure, wealth long stored Of silent thought and fancy in full hoard, Treasures of wisdom and discerning wit, And dreams of beauty chaste and unexplored. She took me to her heart,—and what a heart, Vast as all heaven and love itself and art! She gave it royally as monarchs give Who hold back nothing when they give a part. A king I rose who had knelt down a slave, A soul new born who only sought a grave, A victor from the fight whence I had fled, A hero crowned with bays who was not brave. Blest transformation! Circe's ancient curse See here interpreted in plain reverse. Love, generous love, in me devised a spell Ennobling all and subtler far than hers. Thus was I saved. Yet, mark how hardly Fate Deals with its victors vanquished soon or late. The ransomed captive of his chains goes free. She pines in durance who has paid the debt. Behold this woman of all joy the heir, Robed in high virtue and worth's worthiest wear, A saint by saints esteemed, a matron wise As Rome's Cornelia chastely debonnaire. Behold her touched with my own soul's disease, Grieving in joy and easeless still in ease, The gall of sorrow and the thorn of shame Twined ever in the wreaths love framed to please. Behold her languishing for honour's loss, Her pride nailed daily to a nameless cross, Her vesture sullied with the dust of sin, Her gold of purity transfused with dross. The echo of her voice has tones that thrill: I hear her weeping with a blind wild will. A name she speaks to the dim night, his name Her virtue spared not yet remembered still. “Say, shall I comfort thee?” “O soul of mine, Thy comfort slays me with its joys like wine. Thy love is dear to me—then let me go. Bid me fare forth for aye from thee and thine.” “Is there no pleasure?” “Pleasure is not sweet When doors are shut and veiled Man's mercy-seat. My heaven thou wert, but heaven itself is pain When God is dumb and angels turn their feet.” “Is there no beauty? See, the sun is fair And the world laughs because the Spring is there. Hast thou no laughter?” “Ay, I laugh as Eve Laughed with her lord the night of their despair.” “The past is passed.” “Nay, 'tis a ghost that lives.” “Grief dies.” “We slew it truly and it thrives. Pain walks behind us like a murdered man Asking an alms of joy which vainly gives. “Give me thy tears: their bitterness is true. Give me thy patience: it is all my due. Give me thy silence, if thou wilt thy scorn, But spare thy kisses, for they pierce me through.” I saw her perish, not at once by death, Which has an edge of mercy in its sheath. No bodily pleadings heralded decay; No violence of pity stopped her breath. Only the eternal part which was her mind Had withered there as by a breath unkind. Only the reason of her eyes was mute; Their meaning vanished, leaving naught behind. “No bells shall ring my burial hour,” she said. “No prayers be sung, no requiem for the dead. Only the wind shall chaunt in its wild way, And be thou there to lay flowers on my head.” I laid them on her grave. Alas! dear heart, What love can follow thee where now thou art? Sleep on. My youth sleeps with thee—and the rest Would but disturb. We are too far apart. What has my life been? What life has the wind Wandering for ever on in change of mind Winter and summer, chasing hopes as vain And seeking still the rest it may not find? When she was dead I rose up in my place, Like Israel's king, and smiled and washed my face. My grief had died in me with her long tears, And I was changed and maimed and passionless. I said, “There are griefs wider than this grief, Hopes broader harvested, of ampler sheaf. Man may not live the caged bird of his pride, And he who wends afar shall win relief.” The world of sea and mountain shape high browed Lured me to dreams of nobler solitude, Fair plains beyond the limits of the dawn, And desert places lawless and untrod. Beyond youth's lamp of bitter-sweet desires And manhood's kindling of less lawful fires A star I sought should lead me to my dream Of a new Bethlehem and angelic choirs. This passionate England with its wild unrest, How has it straitened us to needs unblest! Need is that somewhere in the world there be A better wisdom, seek it East or West. I sought it first on that great Continent Which is the eldest born of man's intent. All that the race of Japhet has devised Of wit to live lives there pre-eminent. The record of the ages proudly stand Revealed in constancy and close at hand, Man's march triumphant against natural foes, His conquest of the air and sea and land, From that far day when, wielding shafts of stone, He drove the bear back from the banks of Rhone, And built his dwelling on the fair lake's shore He earliest learned to love and call his own, On thro' the generations of wild men, The skin-clad hunters of the field and fen, At war with life, all life than theirs less strong Less fenced with cunning in its lawless den, Until the dawn broke of a larger age, With milder fortunes and designs more sage, And men raised cities on the naked plains With wine and corn and oil for heritage. Etruscan Italy! Pelasgic Greece! How did they labour in the arts of peace! If strong men were before the time of Troy, What of the wise who planned their palaces? The men of cunning who, ere letters came To hand their learning down from fame to fame, Dealt with Titanic square and basalt slab And found the law of parallelogram? Unnamed discoverers, or of those who gave Its rule to beauty, line and curve and wave, Smelters of bronze, artificers in gold, Painters of tear-cups for the hero's grave? Or those, the last, who of Man's social state Devised the code his lusts to mitigate, Who set a bridle on his jaws of pride, And manacled with law his limbs of hate, Till each fair town its separate polity Enjoyed in its own walls well-fenced and free, With king and court and poet and buffoon And burgess roll inscribed of chivalry? This was the old world's golden age renowned Shown thro' dim glimpses of a past spell-bound. Some shadow of it lives in Homer's story. In vain we search. Its like shall not be found. It vanished in the impatient march of Man When Empires rose, with Cyrus in the van, The Assyrian tyranny, the Persian scourge, And his the all-conquering boy of Macedon. Then were the little freedoms swept aside, The household industries for fields more wide. With heavy hand Rome weighed upon the world A blind Colossus, order classified. And what of the new world, the world that is? Ah, Europe! What a tragedy there lies! Thy faiths forgotten and thy laws made void, Hunger and toil thy sole known destinies. The sombre livery of thy bastard races Proclaims thee slave and their ignoble faces, Gaul, Teuton, Serb, all fortunes merged in one, All bloods commingled in thy frail embraces. No type, no image of the God in thee, No form survives of nobler ancestry, No mark is on thy brow, even that of Cain, By which to learn thy soul's lost pedigree. Thou toilest blindly in thy central hive Of the world's hopes impatient and alive, Waiting the reason which shall light thy years To a new gospel of initiative, Rueful, unconscious, to thy labour bound And dumb to love, above or underground. He were the Sage of the new discipline Who first should wake thy silence into sound. Where is the poet who shall sing of Man In his new world, a better Caliban, And show him Heaven? What nobler Prospero To cure his ache on an Eternal plan? The voice that should arouse that slumbering clod Must echo boldly as to steps unshod Of angels heralding the advent day Of a new Saviour and a latest God. But whose the voice? And where the listeners? I sought and found not. Rather in my ears The discord grew of that ungodly host Whose laughter mocks the music of the Spheres. “Glory of glories!” Thus it was they chaunted, But not to Heaven for which men blindly panted, Rather to that Hell's master who hath held Their backs to pain in labour covenanted. To him the honour and obedience due Of their lost Moab where the bluebells blew, Now the sad washpot of his engines' slime, Their childhood's Edom darkened by his shoe. Through that dim murk no glimpse of the Divine Shall pierce with song where the sun dares not shine, No praise of beauty in a land all bleared With poison-smoke and waters aniline? Better they died unchronicled. Their room Would then be for each weed that wreathed their tomb, More beautiful than they with all their love It is not worth a spray of butcher's broom. All this I read as in an open book Wandering in bye paths with my pilgrim's crook, Through Alp and Apennine and Eastward on To where the Balkans on the Danube look. On Trajan's wall I lay in the tall grass And watched the Tartar shepherds wandering pass. A boy was blowing in his flute below; Afar the river shone, a sea of glass. This was the world's once boundary; and beyond What terrors reigned for fearful hearts and fond, The Scythian wilderness, where were-wolves were And night for ever lay in frozen bond! The subtle wonder of the desert came And touched my longing with its breath of flame. I too, methought, sad child of a new age, Would learn its mystery and inscribe my name, Clothed in the garments of its ancient past, My race forgotten and my creed outcast, On some lone pile whence centuries look down On days unchanged the earliest with the last. As Abraham was at Mamre on the leas, I too would be, or Ur of the Chaldees, Feeding my flocks in patience at God's hand, Guided by signs and girt with mysteries. With staff in hand and wallet for all need, Footing the goat-tracks or with ass for steed, Clad in mean raiment, with attendants none, And fed on locusts as the prophets feed. Climbing the dunes each morning to behold The world's last miracle of light enfold The Eastern heaven, and see the victor sun Press back the darkness with his spears of gold. The fair Earth, pure in her sweet nakedness, Should smile for me each day with a new face, Her only lover; and her virgin sands Should be my daily sacrilege to press. The deep blue shadows of the rocks at noon My tent should be from a burnt world in swoon, Rocks scored with what dead names of worshippers, Of Gods as dead, the sun and stars and moon. There would I stand in prayer, with unshod feet And folded arms, at Time's true mercy seat, Making my vows to the one God of gods Whose praise the Nations of the East repeat. Haply some wonder of prophetic kind My eyes should see to the world's reason blind, Some ladder to the Heaven, or a face Speaking in thunder to me from the wind. I lay in the tall grass, and overhead The ravens called who once Elisha fed. It was a message meet for my desires, And I arose and followed where they led, Arose and followed;—and behold, at hand, With tinkling bells and tread as if on sand, Toward me spectral from the Orient came The pilgrim camels of that holy Land. The rock of Horeb is the holiest place Of all Earth's holies. In the wilderness It stands with its gaunt head bare to the heaven As when God spake with Moses face to face. Red in the eternal sunset of the years, Crowned with a glory the world's evening wears, Where evening is with morning a first day Unchanged in the mute music of the Spheres. From base to top the boulder crags high thrown Fortress the plain which Israel camped upon, A living presence in the unliving waste, A couchant lion with a mane of stone. Aloft in the dread shadow of his brows And shut from summer suns and winter snows, When snows there be in the parched wilderness, A cell I found and of it made my house. A single hewn stone chamber, carved of old By hermits' hands, of rocks with labour rolled, Undoored, unwindowed, with the earth for floor, Within, an altar where their beads they told. Without, a rood of soil and a scant spring, Their garden once, where deep in the vast ring Of those grave granite domes they delved and prayed, One thorn tree its sole life left blossoming. There laid I down the burden of my care And dwelt a space in the clean upper air. I dwelt, how many days or months or years I know not, for I owned no calendar; Only the rising of the winter's sun Daily more northward as the months moved on, Only the sun's return along his ways When summer slackened his first rage outrun; Only the bee-birds passing overhead With their Spring twitter and eyes crimson red, The storks and pelicans in soldier bands, The purple doves that stayed to coo and wed; These and the shepherds of the waste, the few Poor Bedouin clansmen, with their weak flocks, who Strayed through the valleys at appointed days, As water failed them or the herbage grew, Lean hungry-eyed wild sons of Ishmael Who climbed the rocks and sought me in my cell With their poor wares of butter, dates and corn And almond-cake in skins and hydromel, Unwise in the world's learning, yet with gleams Of subtler instinct than the vain world deems, Glimpses of faiths transmitted from afar In signs and wonders and revealed in dreams. They taught me their strange knowledge, how to read The forms celestial ordered to Man's need, To count on sand the arrow heads of fate And mark the bird's flight and the grey hare's speed. The empty waste informed with their keen eyes Became a scroll close writ with mysteries Unknown to reason yet compelling awe With that brave folly which confounds the wise. Nor less the faith was there of the revealed God of their fathers, Ishmael's sword and shield, Their own, the Merciful, the Compassionate, By martyrs witnessed in the stricken field. His name was on their lips, a living name. His law was in their hearts, their pride in shame. His will their fortitude in hours of ill When the skies rained not and the locusts came. I learned their creed in this as in the rest, Making submission to God's ways as best. What matter if in truth the ways were His, So I should abdicate my own unblest! And thus I might have lived—and died, who knows, A Moslem saint, on those high mountain brows, Prayed to by alien lips in alien prayer As intercessor for their mortal woes, Lived, died, and been remembered for some good In the world's chronicle of brotherhood, Nor yet through strife with his own Bedlam kind, The Hydra-headed Saxon multitude. But for the clamour of untimely war, The sound of Nations marching from afar. Their voice was on the tongue of winds and men, Their presaging in sun and moon and star. I dreamed a dream of our fair mother Earth In her first beauty, ere mankind had birth, Peopled with forms how perfect in design, How rich in purpose, of what varied worth, Birds, four-foot beasts and fishes of the Sea Each in its kind and order and degree Holding their place unchid, her children all, And none with right to strain her liberty. Her deep green garment of the forest glade Held monsters grim, but none was there afraid. The lion and the antelope lay down In the same thicket for their noon-day shade. The tyranny of strength was powerless all To break her order with unseemly brawl. No single kind, how stout soe'er of limb, Might drive her weakest further than the wall. All was in harmony and all was true On the green Earth beneath her tent of blue. When lo, the advent of her first born lie, The beast with mind from which her bondage grew. O woeful apparition! what a shape To set the world's expectancy agape, To crown its wonders! what lewd naked thing To wreck its Paradise! The human ape! Among the forms of dignity and awe It moved a ribald in the world of law, In the world's cleanness it alone unclean, With hairless buttocks and prognathous jaw. Behold it in that Eden once so fair, Pirate and wanton, a blind pillager, With axe and fire and spade among the trees Blackening a league to build itself a lair. Behold it marshalling its court,—soft kine, And foolish sheep and belly-lorded swine, Striding the horse anon, high-mettled fool, And fawned on by the dog as one divine. Outrage on sense and decent Nature's pride! Feast high of reason—nay of Barmecide, Where every guest goes hungry but this one, The Harpy-clawed, too foul to be denied! I saw it, and I blushed for my Man's race, And once again when in the foremost place Of human tyranny its latest born Stood threatening conquest with an English face. Chief of the sons of Japhet he, with hand Hard on the nations of the sea and land, Intolerant of all, tongues, customs, creeds, Too dull to spare, too proud to understand. I saw them shrink abashed before his might, Like tropic birds before the sparrow's flight. The world was poorer when they fled. But he Deemed he had done “God” service and “his right.” I saw it and I heard it and I rose With the clear vision of a seer that knows. I had a message to the powers of wrong And counted not the number of my foes. I stood forth in the strength of my soul's rage And spoke my word of truth to a lewd age. It was the first blow struck in that mad war, My last farewell to my fair hermitage. O God of many battles! Thou that art Strong to withstand when warriors close and part, That art or wast the Lord of the right cause! How has thy hand grown feeble in its smart! How are the vassals of thy power to-day Set in rebellion mastering the fray! Blaspheming Thee they smite with tongues obscene, While these Thy saints lie slaughtered where they pray. How is the cauldron of thy wrath the deepest, Cold on its stones? No fire for it thou heapest. Thou in the old time wert a jealous God. Thieves have dishonoured Thee. And lo, Thou sleepest! Between the camps I passed in the still night, The breath of heaven how pure, the stars how bright. On either hand the life impetuous flowed Waiting the morrow which should crown the fight. How did they greet it? With what voice, what word, What mood of preparation for the sword? On this side and on that a chaunt was borne Faint on the night-wind from each hostile horde. Here lay the camps. The sound from one rose clear, A single voice through the thrilled listening air. “There is no God but God,” it cried aloud. “Arise, ye faithful, 'tis your hour of prayer.” And from the other? Hark the ignoble chorus, Strains of the music halls, the slums before us. Let our last thought be as our lives were there, Drink and debauchery! The drabs adore us. And these were proved the victors on that morrow, And those the vanquished, fools, beneath war's harrow. And the world laughed applauding what was done, And if the angels wept none heard their sorrow. What has my life been in its last best scene Stripped of Time's violence, its one serene Experience of things fair without a flaw, Its grasp of Heaven's own paradisal green? After the storm the clouds white laughters fly; After the battle hark the children's cry! After the stress of pain, if God so will, We too may taste our honey ere we die. What little secret 'tis we need discover! How small a drop to make the cup brim over! A single word half spoken between two, And Heaven is there, the loved one and the lover. Tell me not, thou, of youth as Time's last glory. Tell not of manhood when it strikes its quarry. The prime of years is not the prime of pleasure. Give me life's later love when locks are hoary, Love, when the hurry and the rush are past, Love when the soul knows what will fade what last, The worth of simple joys youth trampled on, Its pearl of price upon the dunghill cast. Time was, I mocked, I too, at life's plain blisses, The rustic treasure of connubial kisses, The bourgeois wealth of amorous maid and man Made man and wife in legal tendernesses. Time was, but is not, since the scales of pride Fell from my eyes and left me glorified. Now 'tis the world's turn. Let it laugh at me, Who care not, having Love's self on my side. How came I by this jewel, this sweet friend, This best companion of my lone life's end? So young she was, so fair, of soul so gay, And I with only wisdom to commend. I looked into her eyes and saw them seek My own with questions, roses on her cheek. One sign there is of love no words belie, The soul's wide windows watching where lips speak. What wouldst thou with me, thou dear wise one, say? My face is withered, my few locks are grey. Time has dealt with me like a dolorous Jew. My gold he holds; in silver now I pay. How shall I serve thee? Shall I be thy priest, To read thy dear sins to the last and least? I have some knowledge of the ways of men, Some too of women. Wilt thou be confessed? Nay, but thou lovest? A gay youth and fair? Is he less kind to thee than lovers are? Shall I chastise him for his backward ways, Teach him thy whole worth and his own despair? Thou dost deny? Thou lovest none? To thee Youth, sayest thou, is void, mere vanity. Yet how to build up life and leave out love, The corner stone of all its joys to be? Thou wouldst be wise. Thou swearest to me this. Know then, all wisdom is but happiness. So thou art happy, there is none more sage Than thou of the wise seven famed of Greece. She did not answer me, but heaved a sigh And raised her eyes, where tears stood, silently. I kissed her hands, the outside and the in, “Child, dost thou love me?” And she whispered “Ay.” Thus the thing happened. And between us two Was now a secret beautiful and new. We hid it from all eyes as fearing ill, And cherished it in wonder, and it grew. Some say that Heaven is but to be with God, Hell—but without God—the same blest abode. How wide the difference only those may know Whose eyes have seen the glory and the cloud. We two beheld the glory. Every morn We rose to greet it with the day new born; No laggards we when Love was in the fields Waiting to walk there with us in the corn. O those first hours of the yet folded day, While Man still sleeps and Nature has its play, When beast and bird secure from death and him Wander and wanton in their own wild way. These were our prize untroubled by the whim Of slugging fools still wrapped in dreamings dim. In these we lived a whole life ere their day And heard the birds chaunt and the seraphim. How good it was to see her through the grass, Pressing to meet me with her morning face Wreathed in new smiles by the sweet thought within Triumphant o'er the world and worldlings base! How good to mark her beauty decked anew With leaf and blossom, crimson, white and blue! The beechen spray fresh gathered in her hand Was her queen's sceptre diamonded with dew. I heard her young voice long ere she was near, Calling her call-note of the wood dove clear. It was our signal. And I answered low In the same note, “Beloved, I am here.” And then the meeting. Who shall count the bliss Of sweet words said and sweeter silences. It was agreed between us we should wed Some happy day nor yet forestall a kiss. Sublime convention by true lovers made To try their joy more nearly in the shade. “Not yet, dear love! Thy mad lips take from mine, Lest thou shouldst harm me and the world upbraid.” Who says a wedding day is not all white From dawn to dusk, nay far into the night? The man who makes not that one day divine Dullard is he and dastard in Love's sight. First day of the new month, the honeymoon, Last of the old life naked and alone. The apparent heirship come to actual reign, The entrance in possession of a throne. Why grudge rejoicings? The vain world is there. It sees the feast spread that it may not share. God's angels envy thee; then why not these? Let them make merry with thy wealth to spare. Nay, join it thou. The foolish old life waits, A slave discharged, to see thee to the gates. Give it thy bounty, though it claim thy all, Thy clothes, thy bed, thy empty cups and plates. The world hath loved thee, or it loved thee not, What matter now! Thou needest raise no doubt. All smile on thee to-day, the false, the true. The new king pardons. Shout then with their shout. Thy friends surround thee, sceptics of thy reason. They ply thee gaily in and out of season. Thou in thy heart the while art far away True to thy god. Thou heedest not their treason. Proud in the face of all thou vowest thy vow, Love in thine eyes and glory on thy brow, Thou hast sworn to cherish her, to have, to hold, “Till death us twain do part.” Ah she! Ah thou! What has my life been? Nay, my life is good. Dear life, I love thee, now thou art subdued. Thou hast fled the battle, cast thine arms away, And so art victor of the multitude. Thou art forgotten wholly of thy foes, Of thy friends wholly, these alike with those. One garden of the world thy kingdom is Walled from the wicked, and there blooms thy rose. She that I love lives there and lives with me. Enough, kind heaven, I make my terms with thee. Worth, wealth, renown, power, honour—shadows all! This is the substance, this reality. O world that I have known! how well, things, men, Glories of vanity, the sword, the pen! Fair praise of kings, applause of crowds—nay more, Saints' pure approval of the loss and gain! High deeds of fame which made the eyelids brim With tears of pride grief's anguish could not dim, The day of triumph crowning all the days, The harvest of the years brought home by Time! What are you to Man's heart, his soul, his sense Prouder than this, more robed in incidence? The cry of the first babe, his own, and hers, Thrilling to joy? Ah matchless eloquence! The wisdom of all Time is in that cry, The knowledge of Life's whence, at last, and why, The root of Love new grafted in the tree, Even as it falls, which shall not wholly die. To rest in a new being! Here it stands The science of all ages in all lands, The joy which makes us kin with the Earth's life, And knits us with all Nature joining hands, Till we forget our heritage of gloom, Our dark humanity how near its doom. Away! Man's soul was a disease. 'Tis fled Scared by this infant face of perfect bloom. And so, farewell, poor passionate Life, the past. I close thy record with this word, “Thou wast.” Why wait upon the Future? Lo To-day Smiles on our tears, Time's toy, his best and last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II DEDICATION TO GEORGE WYNDHAM TO A HAPPY WARRIOR Glory to God who made a man like this! To God be praise who in the empty heaven Set Earth's gay globe With its green vesture given And nuptial robe To be the home enthroned of happiness! Who from the silences Of the dumb Universe, For listening ears, Constructed song And fashioned the first note Of the first linnet's throat, His audible whisper the deep woods among! Who, with His dance-masters, The dappled deer And their fleet fawns, With rhythmic beat Of their light feet Upon the thyme-sweet lawns, Framed the free gamut of the wakening year And gave command to mirth His minister That all things young and glad And mad, In this fair world's expanse Should dance! Praise be! and most for these, The lyric ecstasies Sublime in each least lot, The passionate plot Subtly contrived to propagate their kind By beast and bird and in Man's livelier mind To make of life new life, Of joy new joy, in corporal bliss Entwined, Man's who is man and wife, Though neither he have thought Nor she, in their love blind, Of that child's smile Half hers half his Unborn, the while They clasp and kiss! These are the vastnesses That bid us give God glory for his depths of guile. And he? The ultimate man, The heir of their delight, Whose keener sight Grasped the full vision of Time's master-plan, And who, because he knew, Found power to do What the rest dared not and was thus the priest Of the divine high feast Of Love on Earth? Poet, whose prosody Embraced heaven's infinite blue And the white light of stars, The moon's proud chastity And the sea beating on its prison bars; Whose ritual Was the procession of the months and days In ordered praise Of ceremonial flowers, Earth's virginal Patchwork of shredded colours in the grass; Whose incense was The mist of morning, and whose sacrifice The sun in splendour by whose light all live? How shall we give To one thus wise Our homage who so loved him and alas Now weep for him with unavailing eyes? For what is wisdom more than this one thought, To harvest happiness? Time has its wheat, Its rule of life discreet, By scholars taught, For daily bread; and its weeds too, Its wild crop of the woods which is not bought, Its way that fools call folly, Choke-pear, crab, holly, All the riot Of the bird's diet, For maid and boy, Their winter-pick of joy, If they but knew! And these to learn and gather in their prime Is youth's sublime. Here lay his victory. Not flowers alone Nor fruits were his, But the world's sadnesses He gathered also, its loves lost and gone, The tragic things that are As the maple leaves Of the fast dying year, Crowning its funeral car, The glory of its passing set on fire In the late hedges, The wreathed bryony Black with the Autumn saltings of the Sea, And those lone sedges at the lake's edges Which winter winds have whitened on the mere. These, as the symbols of his Soul's romance In antique lands, He bound into the sheaves Of his desire, A wreath, Nobler for death. Of these he fashioned a new chivalry For days to be, Incorporate with the glories of all Time, The immortal rhyme Of Roland and the paladins of France, Of Charlemagne, The Cid Bivar of Spain, And those pround questers of the Holy Grail Who rode with Arthur cap à pie in mail, Till in his hands It seemed the actual lance Of Lancelot trembled and took edge and shook Defiance at his foes in Lyonnesse, No less than those Of whom it is written in the old French book That he pursued and slew and scattering rent Their ranks in fear, While the Earth trembled his glad shout to hear. So he in his high rage in Parliament. Anon, too, at the feasts Where with the knights and ladies crowned he sat, Their laureate Of that famed Table Round, its pleasure's lord, His was the tongue To celebrate their praise, Theirs the adored, With virile minstrelsy and mirth and song, And generous wine Outpoured In draughts divine from flagons Rich with the mellow fruitage of the vine; His was the tongue To tell of valorous deeds Done for high honour's needs On pestilent dragons in dank forest places Vanquished and slain, and felon knights laid low, For fair loved faces In days long ago; Amorous sad tales of dolorous mistakes At hands that sought to save; Ancient heart-aches, Each laid to rest in its forgotten grave. And with them griefs, which venturing found their hour, Fruitage and flower, And were fulfilled of joy;—and chiefly hers, Royal sad Guinevere's Noblest of all among the tragic dead. Of her he loved to tell. And he did well; For she, the lady of his dreams, one night, As it is said, In Glastonbury, Hearing his young steps hurry As to a goal, To kneel at her dead feet, Where as she lay with her sleep-folded palms In the long calms Of a passed soul, Did from her cerements white Awake, And feel her passionate heart beat To his desire, And in new bride's attire Arise and live a woman for his sake, A woman and no dream. These were the rhapsodies of life to him, The things that his heart's zeal Made real. And who shall wonder if to-day we weep Our Prince of happiness, Our warrior dead? If we, who saw These wonders beyond law, And his proud soul's essay To live the great life of the Fellowship In our late day, Should mourn him fled, Yet, none the less, Give praise To God, with chastened but undoubting lip, For this exemplar of His works and ways? Since that we know that in His scheme of bliss No permanent anguish is, But beauty only and high ruth and truth, And that Life's law is this: Pleasure is duty, duty pleasure In equal measure; And Time's happiness God's all-sufficient reason with the wise, As with this man Who sleeps in Paradise. SUSSEX PASTORALS THE OLD SQUIRE II I like the hunting of the hare Better than that of the fox; I like the joyous morning air, And the crowing of the cocks. II I like the calm of the early fields, The ducks asleep by the lake, The quiet hour which Nature yields, Before mankind is awake. III I like the pheasants and feeding things Of the unsuspicious morn; I like the flap of the wood-pigeon's wings As she rises from the corn. IV I like the blackbird's shriek, and his rush From the turnips as I pass by, And the partridge hiding her head in a bush, For her young ones cannot fly. V I like these things, and I like to ride, When all the world is in bed, To the top of the hill where the sky grows wide, And where the sun grows red. VI The beagles at my horse heels trot, In silence after me; There's Ruby, Roger, Diamond, Dot, Old Slut and Margery, VII A score of names well used, and dear, The names my childhood knew; The horn, with which I rouse their cheer, Is the horn my father blew. VIII I like the hunting of the hare Better than that of the fox; The new world still is all less fair Than the old world it mocks. IX I covet not a wider range Than these dear manors give; I take my pleasures without change And as I lived I live. X I leave my neighbours to their thought; My choice it is, and pride, On my own lands to find my sport, In my own fields to ride. XI The hare herself no better loves The field where she was bred, Than I the habit of these groves, My own inherited. XII I know my quarries every one, The meuse where she sits low; The road she chose to-day was run A hundred years ago. XIII The lags, the gills, the forest ways, The hedgerows one and all, These are the kingdoms of my chase, And bounded by my wall; XIV Nor has the world a better thing, Though one should search it round, Than thus to live one's own sole king, Upon one's own sole ground. XV I like the hunting of the hare; It brings me, day by day, The memory of old days as fair, With dead men past away. XVI To these, as homeward still I ply And pass the churchyard gate, Where all are laid as I must lie, I stop and raise my hat. XVII I like the hunting of the hare; New sports I hold in scorn. I like to be as my fathers were, In the days ere I was born. WORTH FOREST Come, Prudence, you have done enough to-day— The worst is over, and some hours of play We both have earned, even more than rest, from toil; Our minds need laughter, as a spent lamp oil, And after their long fast a recompense. How sweet the evening is with its fresh scents Of briar and fern distilled by the warm wind! How green a robe the rain has left behind! How the birds laugh!—What say you to a walk Over the hill, and our long promised talk About the rights and wrongs of infancy? Our patients are asleep, dear angels, she Holding the boy in her ecstatic arms, As mothers do, and free from past alarms, The child grown calm. If we, an hour or two, Venture to leave them, 'tis but our hope's due. My tongue is all agog to try its speed To a new listener, like a long-stalled steed Loosed in a meadow, and the Forest lies At hand, the theme of its best flatteries. See, Prudence, here, your hat, where it was thrown The night you found me in the house alone With my worst fear and these two helpless things. Please God, that worst has folded its black wings, And we may let our thoughts on pleasure run Some moments in the light of this good sun. They sleep in Heaven's guard. Our watch to-night Will be the braver for a transient sight— The only one perhaps more fair than they— Of Nature dressed for her June holiday. This is the watershed between the Thames And the South coast. On either hand the streams Run to the great Thames valley and the sea, The Downs, which should oppose them, servilely Giving them passage. Who would think these Downs, Which look like mountains when the sea-mist crowns Their tops in autumn, were so poor a chain? Yet they divide no pathways for the rain, Nor store up waters, in this pluvious age, More than the pasteboard barriers of a stage. The crest lies here. From us the Medway flows To drain the Weald of Kent, and hence the Ouse Starts for the Channel at Newhaven. Both These streams run eastward, bearing North and South. But, to the West, the Adur and the Arun Rising together, like twin rills of Sharon, Go forth diversely, this through Shoreham gap, And that by Arundel to Ocean's lap. All are our rivers, by our Forest bred, And one besides which with more reverend heed We need to speak, for her desert is great Beyond the actual wealth of her estate. For Spenser sang of her, the River Mole, And Milton knew her name, though he, poor soul, Had never seen her, as I think being blind, And so miscalled her sullen. Others find Her special merit to consist in this: A maiden coyness, and her shy device Of mole-like burrowing. And in truth her way Is hollowed out and hidden from the day, Under deep banks and the dark overgrowth Of knotted alder roots and stumps uncouth, From source to mouth; and once at Mickleham, She fairly digs her grave, in deed and name, And disappears. There is an early trace Of this propensity to devious ways Shown by the little tributary brook Which bounds our fields, for lately it forsook Its natural course, to burrow out a road Under an ash tree in its neighbourhood. But whether this a special virtue is, Or like some virtues but a special vice, We need not argue. This at least is true, That in the Mole are trout, and many too, As I have often proved with rod and line From boyhood up, blest days of pins and twine! How many an afternoon have our hushed feet Crept through the alders where the waters meet, Mary's and mine, and our eyes viewed the pools Where the trout lay, poor unsuspecting fools, And our hands framed their doom,—while overhead His orchestra of birds the backbird led. In those lost days, no angler of them all Could boast our cunning with the bait let fall, Close to their snouts, from some deceiving coigne, Or mark more notches when we stopped to join Our fishes head to tail and lay them out Upon the grass, and count our yards of trout. 'Twas best in June, with the brook growing clear After a shower, as now. In dark weather It was less certain angling, for the stream Was truly “sullen” then, so deep and dim. 'Tis thus in mountain lakes, as some relate, Where the fish need the sun to see the bait. The fly takes nothing in these tangled brooks, But grief to fishermen and loss of hooks; And all our angling was of godless sort, With living worm,—and yet we loved the sport. But wait. This path will lead us to the gill, Where you shall see the Mole in her first rill, Ere yet she leaves the Forest, and her bed Is still of iron-stone, which stains her red, Yet keeps her pure and lends a pleasant taste To her young waters as they bubble past. You hear her lapping round the barren flanks Of these old heaps we call the “Cinder-banks,” Where our forefathers forged their iron ore, When Paul's was building. Now, the rabbits bore In the still nights, beneath these ancient heaps, A very honeycomb. See, where she peeps, The infant river. You could hardly wet Your ankles in her midmost eddy yet. She has a pretty cunning in her look Mixed with alarm, as in her secret nook We find her out, half fugitive, half brave, A look that all the Forest creatures have. Let us away. Perhaps her guilelessness Is troubled at a guilty human face, (Mine, Prudence,—not your own). I know a dell Knee deep in fern, hard by, the very cell For an elf hermit. Here stag-mosses grow, Thick as a coverlet, and fox-gloves blow Purple and white, and the wild columbine, And here in May there springs that thing divine, The lily of the valley, only here Found in the Forest, blossoming year on year; A place o'ershadowed by a low-crowned oak. The enchanted princess never had been woke If she had gone to sleep in such a spot, In spite of fortune. Why, a corpse forgot Might lie, with eyes appealing to the sky, Unburied here for half a century. And this the woodcocks, as I take it, knew, Who stayed to breed here all the summer through, When other birds were gone. I flushed a pair On the longest day last year; the nest was there; And found some egg-shells chipped among the moss. The sight is rarer now than once it was. There! We have gathered breath and climbed the hill, And now can view the landscape more at will. This is the Pilgrim road, a well-known track, When folk did all their travelling on horseback, Now long deserted, yet a right of way, And marked on all our maps with due display. Beneath this yew-tree, which perhaps has seen Our fathers riding to St. Thomas' shrine, (For this was once the way of pilgrimage From the south-west for all who would engage Their vows at Canterbury), we will sit, As doubtless they too sat, and rest a bit. I love this solitude of birch and fern, These quags and mosses, and I love the stern Black yew-trees and the hoary pastures bare, Or tufted with long growths of withered hair And rank marsh grass. I love the bell-heath's bloom, And the wild wealth which passionate Earth's womb Throws in the Forest's lap to clothe unseen Its ancient barrenness with youth and green. I love the Forest; 'tis but this one strip Along the watershed that still dares keep Its title to such name. Yet once wide grown A mighty woodland stretched from Down to Down, The last stronghold and desperate standing-place Of that indigenous Britannic race Which fell before the English. It was called By Rome “Anderida,” in Saxon “Weald.” Time and decay, and Man's relentless mood, Have long made havock of the lower wood With axe and plough; and now, of all the plain, These breadths of higher ground alone remain, In token of its presence. Who shall tell How long, in these lost wilds of brake and fell, Or in the tangled groves of oak below, Gathering his sacred leaf, the mistletoe, Some Druid priest, forgotten and in need, May here have kept his rite and owned his creed After the rest? For hardly yet less rude, Here later dwelt that patron of our wood, The Christian Hermit Leonard, he who slew The last authentic dragon England knew; A man of prayer and penitential vows, Whose tale survives in many a forest house. For, having slain his monster, he was given To choose whate'er he would in gift from Heaven, And took for his sole recompense this thing: “Snakes should not bite, nor nightingales should sing Within the Forest precincts.” Thus, thought he, His orisons should unmolested be By mundane joys and troubles. Yonder ridge, Cutting the sky-line at the horizon's edge, Is the Surrey Hills. Beneath the chalk pit, set Like a white cloud upon the face of it, Lies Dorking, famed for fowls, and, further still, Wotton and Shere. In front you have Leith Hill, Which looks upon St. Paul's and on the sea, A point of note in our geography. All this is Evelyn's land, who long ago Left us his record of the vale below And wrote the “Silva” now to hands as good Passed, the descendant's of his name and blood, That doughty squire's, who lately stood in fight With the new dragons of the Primrose rite, And broke a lance for Ireland and the cause Of freedom, flouted by coercion laws. Strange change! For long in history these same hills Were held as ominous of lowland ills, A source of robber fear, in foul repute, And natural fortress since the days of Knute, And earlier still when Saxon Sussex stood A home-ruled kingdom of primæval wood. A camp, an eagle's nest, a foot set down Into the Weald, and evil of renown With the free dwellers of the plain, who saw A menace brooding of imperial law. Saxon or Dane or Norman, each in turn, Set there his camp to pillage and to burn; For history, just as now, was mainly then A tale of wars 'twixt regiments and men. We, forest dwellers, show with honest boast Our Slaughter Bridge, where the Norse horde was lost, Drowned in the red Mole waters, when the Dane Fled from his eyrie, nor returned again. The farthest point of all, and looking west, Is the line of Hindhead, on whose triple crest, With a good glass, a three-inch telescope, You might make out the cross upon the top: It used to be a gibbet. As a child What tales I treasured of that headland wild, With its three murderers, who in chains there hung, Rocked by the winds and tempest-tossed and swung! Three Portsmouth sailors were they who their mate Murdered for gold and grog, which guineas get, And in the “Punch Bowl” made their brute carouse, Leaving him dead, in a lone public-house, Where retribution seized them as was due,— For in that age of simple faiths and true Murder did always out,—and so apace Brought them to justice in that self-same place; And many years they hung. At last its sway Humanity, that child of yesterday, Asserted in their case, and craved their bones For Christian sepulture and these trim stones. I half regret the leniency thus lent: Their gallows-tree was their best monument; But ours is a trim age. There, farther down, Is a tower, or “folly,” built of late by one We call in these parts “Chevalier de Malt,” (The brewers love high places, and no fault). Behind us the chief ridge. And, as I speak, Out of its bowels, with an angry shriek, And rushing down the valley at our feet, The train has found us out in our retreat. It came from Balcombe tunnel and is bound To be in London ere an hour is round. It scarcely scares our solitude away; And yonder Royston crows, the black and grey, Sit on unmoved upon their oak. This ridge Is only thirty miles from London Bridge, And, when the wind blows north, the London smoke Comes down upon us, and the grey crows croak, For the great city seems to reach about With its dark arms, and grip them by the throat. Time yet may prove them right. The wilderness May be disforested, and Nature's face Stamped out of beauty by the heel of Man, Who has no room for beauty in his plan. Such things may be, for things as strange have been. This very place, where peace and sylvan green And immemorial silence and the mood Of solemn Nature, virgin and unwooed, Seem as a heritage,—this very place Was once the workshop of a busy race Which dug and toiled and sweated. Here once stood, Amid the blackened limbs of tortured wood, And belching smoke and fury from its mouth, A monstrous furnace, to whose jaws uncouth A race as monstrous offered night and day The Forest's fairest offspring for a prey. Here stood a hamlet, black and populous, With human sins and sorrows in each house, A mining centre. Which of us could guess Each yew-tree yonder marks a dwelling-place Of living men and women?—nay, a tomb? Of all the secrets hidden in Earth's womb, None surely is more pitiful and strange Than this of human death and human change Amid the eternal greenness of the Spring. All we may guess of what the years shall bring, Is this: that about April every year, White blossoms shall burst forth upon the pear And pink upon the apple. Nothing else. Earth has a silent mockery which repels Our questioning. Her history is not ours, And overlays it with a growth of flowers. Ah, Prudence, you who wonder, being town bred, What troubles grieve us in the lives we lead, What cause we have for sorrow in these fields Whose beauty girds us with its thousand shields,— This is our tragedy. You cannot know, In your bald cities, where no cowslips blow, How dear life is to us. The tramp of feet Brushes all older footsteps from the street, And you see nothing of the graves you tread. With us they are still present, the poor dead, And plead with us each day of life, and cry “Did I not love my life, I too, even I?” You wonder!—Wonder rather we are not All touched with madness and disease of thought, Being so near the places where they sleep Who sowed these fields we in their absence reap. It were more logical. And here in truth No few of our Weald peasants in their youth Lose their weak wits, or in their age go mad, Brooding on sights the world had deemed most glad. I have seen many such. The Hammer Ponds, So frequent in the Forest's outer bounds, Have all their histories of despairing souls Brought to their depths to find their true life's goals. You see one in the hollow, where the light Touches its blackness with a gleam of white, Deep down, and over-browed with sombre trees Shutting its surface primly from the breeze, The landscape's innocent eye, set open wide To watch the heavens,—yet with homicide Steeped to the lids. 'Tis scarce a year ago The latest sufferer from our rural woe Found there his exit from a life too weak To shield him from despairs he dared not speak. A curious lad. I knew young Marden well, Brought up, a farmer's son, at the plough's tail, And used for all romance to mind the crows At plain day-wages in his father's house. A “natural” he, and weak in intellect, His fellows said, nor lightly to be pricked To industry at any useful trade; His wits would go wool-gathering in the shade At harvest time, when all had work on hand, Nor, when you spoke, would seem to understand. At times his choice would be for days together To leave his work and idle in the heather, Making his bed where shelter could be found Under the fern-stacks or on open ground, Or oftenest in the charcoal burners' hives, When he could win that pity from their wives. Poor soul! He needed pity, for his face, Scarred by a burn, and reft of human grace, And for his speech, which faltering in his head Made a weak babble of the words he said. His eyes too—what a monster's! did you ever Watch a toad's face at evening by a river And note the concentrated light which lies In the twin topazes men call his eyes? Like these were Marden's. From the square of clay Which was his face, these windows of his day Looked out in splendour, but with a fixed stare Which made men start who missed the meaning there. Yet he had thoughts. Not seldom he and I Made in these woods discourse of forestry, Walking together, I with dog and gun, He as a beater, or, if game was none, Marking the timber trees and underwoods. He knew each teller in these solitudes, And loved them with a quite unreasoned art, Learned from no teacher but his own wild heart. Of trees he quaintly talked in measured saws Which seemed the decalogue of Nature's laws, Its burden being as erst, “Thou shalt not kill” Things made by God, which shall outlive thee still. For larch and fir, newcomers from the North, He pleaded scantly when their doom went forth, Knowing they needs must die, and the birch stems, Since Spring renews them, yet with stratagems Framed to delay the moment of their fate. For beech he battled with more keen debate Of hand and eye, in deprecating tone, Holding their rights coeval with our own. But when we came to oak, good Sussex oak, The flame burst forth, and all his being spoke In words that jostled in his throat with tears, “An oak which might outlive a thousand years.” He held this sacrilege. Perhaps some strains Of Druid blood were mingled in his veins, Which gave authority to guard the tree Sacred of yore, and thus he vanquished me. How came he to his end, poor Marden? Well, All stories have their reason, as some tell, In Eves that give the fruit for which men grieve, Or, what is often worse, refuse to give. This last was Marden's unprotected case, Whose virtue failed him, and his ugliness, To escape the common fate of all mankind. He fell in love egregious and purblind, Just like the wisest. She who caused his flame Was not, I think, in honesty to blame If she was less than serious at his suit. Marden, as lover, was grotesquely mute, And his strange eyes were not the orbs to move A maiden's fancy to a dream of love. In truth they were scarce human. Still 'twas hard His passion should be met, for sole reward, With sermon phrases and such gospel talk As preachers license for a Sunday walk, Mixed with her laughter. This was all she gave, An endless course of things beyond the grave, Till he lost reckoning and, poor witless man, Began to reason on the cosmic plan, Which meted this scant mercy in his case, And placed him in such straits for happiness. Can you not see it? All our rustics live In their small round of thoughts as in a hive, Each cell they build resembling each each day, Till their wits swarm, and then they are away. Marden went mad, misled by his queen bee, Through a deep slough of black theology, Which ended in destruction and this pool, With Hell beyond him for his poor dumb soul. He sought her final pity for love lost. She talked of Heaven, and sent him tracts by post. He pleaded. She reproved. She prayed. He swore. She bade him go. He went, and came no more. Such was the history, no whit uncommon. I neither blame the boy nor blame the woman, Only the hardness of a fate which laid Its iron flail upon too weak a head. She watched him go, half doubting what would come, Her last tract crushed betwixt his angry thumb And his clenched fingers, and his lips grown white, And his eyes gleaming with their maniac light, And so towards the hill. That afternoon, The last of a late autumn, saw the sun Set in unusual splendour (it is said A disc of gold in a whole heaven of red), The herald of a frost, the earliest Known for a lifetime. There, for summer dressed, The trees stood stiff and frozen in their green, Belated revellers in some changing scene Of sudden winter and June left behind. In all the forest was no breath of wind For a full fortnight, nor was a leaf shed Long after Nature in her shroud lay dead, A beautiful black frost which held the land In unseen fetters, but with iron hand. The pools were frozen over in the night, Without a flaw or ripple; and their light Reflected every stem of every tree In perfect mirrors of transparency. Boys, who a week before were in the field With bat and ball, now ventured, iron-heeled, On the ice skating, yet awhile in fear, Seeing no footing on the water there. And thus it fell about the corpse was found (You will have guessed it) in the ice fast bound. Two boys, the brothers of the girl he wooed, Tired of their pastime stopped awhile and stood Over a shallow place where rushes grow, And peering down saw a man's face below Watching their own (his eyes were open laid, Fixed in that terrible stare poor Marden's had); And thought they saw a vision. Running back, Loud in their fear, with spectres on their track, They spread the news through all the frightened farms, Filling the cottagers with wild alarms, Till some made bold with spades, and hewed away The ice above to where the dead man lay. There, sure enough, was Marden, his fool's mouth Stuffed for all solace of his sad soul's drouth With the girl's tracts. Thus primed, he had plunged in And ended all, with a last deed of sin, Grotesque and tragic as his life. No less Let us persuaded be he rests in peace, Or where were Heaven's justice? One last tale, As we walk back,—of worthy Master Gale, Our house's founder, who in a dark age Won us the lands we hold in heritage, Working his forge here in the civil wars, And welding fortunes out of iron bars. A story with a moral too, at least, For money makers, of how wealth increased, And most of all for us, to whom his toil Has proved a mine of ease and endless spoil, Though of a truth we are unlineal heirs, Not true descendants of his toils and cares. His history stands recorded in a book Himself achieved, ere Death his anvil broke, A volume full of wisdom and God's praise, Trust in himself, and scorn of human ways. He was a blacksmith, born at Sevenoke In Kent, the toilsome son of toilsome folk, And honourable too, as honour then Was understood among commercial men. He paid his way through life. He owed to none Beyond their will to let the debt run on, Nor trusted any farther than he need. He held the race of man a bastard breed, An evil generation, bred of dust, And prone to spending, idleness and lust. God was his friend. Of Him he counsel took, How he should make new ventures with new luck, Praying each night continuance of health, Increase of wisdom and increase of wealth; Nor ever in his yearly balance sheet Forgot to inscribe himself in Heaven's debt. A virtuous man, and holding with good cause The eternal justice of the social laws Which give to industry its well-earned meed, And leave the weak and idle to their need. From childhood up, he clutched the staff of life, As if it were a cudgel for the strife, And wielded it throughout relentlessly. His parents, brothers, all by God's decree, Died of the plague when he was scarce sixteen. The date, as I have reckoned, should have been The very year the patriots raised their backs To the new pressure of the shipping tax. His first fight was a battle for the pence Left by his father, when, at dire expense Of lawyers' fees and charges without end, He found himself with fifty pounds to spend, And a small stock-in-trade of iron sows, A fireless smithy and an empty house. With these and God's compassion, and a man To strike and blow for him, his trade began, Till in four years his industry had grown To a fair substance in his native town. When he was twenty-one, an accident Brought him to Sussex; and, as Saul was sent To find his father's asses and therewith Met with a kingdom, so this honest smith, While chasing a bad debtor through the Weald, Lit on his fortune in this very field. For, failing of his money, in its stead He took his debtor's forge and smelting shed; Sold his goodwill at Sevenoke, and set His smithy in the Forest next to it. This brought him trade. The civil wars began And each man's hand was set against each man, And sword to sword. But, while his neighbours fought, Gale, like a Gallio, cared for these things nought, And sold his iron with indifferent zeal To kings and Parliaments in need of steel; Or, if a prejudice his thought divides, It is for Cromwell and his Ironsides. But God's be all the glory, His alone Who to His servant Gale such grace had shown! Thus, in an iron age, this thrifty man Got gold and silver, and, while others ran Out of their fortunes, he with pockets full Bought up their lands and held the world a fool. 'Tis now two hundred years since Father Gale Laid down his pick and hammer. He had won, By forty years of toil beneath the sun, The right to work no longer, for himself And for his heirs for ever. This is Wealth! He was a prudent buyer, and died possessed Of some four thousand acres of the best Land in the parish. His first purchases Were in Worth Forest, to his vulgar eyes I fear mere wood for burning. Pease-pottage And Frog's-hole farms came next; and in his age, Wishing, as he says, to have a good estate And house to live in, though the day was late To think of building, and he most abhorred To waste his substance upon brick and board, Holding with prudent minds that such intent Is but at best a “sweet impoverishment” And that the wise man doth more soundly hit Who turns another's folly to his wit, He purchased Caxtons, manor and domain, To be the home of a new race of men. His last words, as recorded by his son, A man of taste and letters and who won A seat in Parliament in William's reign, Were uttered in the ancient Biblic strain Dear to the age he lived in and to him. They might be David's in their cadence grim. “When I am dead and gone,” he said, “my son, Trust in the Lord and in none other, none. Be wary of thy neighbours. They are vile, A brood of vipers, to oppose whose guile I have been at constant charges all my life. Take thee an honest woman for thy wife, And get thee sons who shall inherit all Thy God hath given thee, spite of Adam's fall. Guard well thy rights, and cease not to pull down All gates that block thy highway to the town, Such as that man of Belial, Jacob Sears Has set in Crawley Lane these thirty years. Let no man venture to enclose the wastes. Be on thy guard against such ribald priests As Lee and Troughton. They are an ill brood, A bastard generation, bone and blood. Hold fast to thy religion. Go not thou After lewd women and the worldly show Of rich apparel. Keep thy substance close In thy own chamber for the fear of loss, And thy own counsel closer, lest men find Their way to rob thee of thy peace of mind. But, more than all, be quit of vain pretence, And see thy income equal thy expense, So shalt thou have thy God with thee alway.” Thus runs the story. You have seen to-day The latest shoot of his posterity, The boy we left there sleeping. His shall be One day the guardianship of this domain, As other Gales have held it. It were vain In me to speak of all the goodly fruit Begotten on the stem of this old root, This sour crab-apple, worthy master Gale. This child perhaps. . . . But that will be a tale For new historians. Listen! Did you hear Just now, down in the valley, someone cheer Or hail us? Stop. Ay, there there comes a man, Running and shouting loud as a man can. He sees us too, and slowly through the fern Now climbs to meet us. Something we shall learn Without a doubt. God grant it be not ill! And yet he seems to falter and stand still. What is your message, Penfold? Why this haste? A little closer. Speak man! Here at last You have found us. Come. What is it that you said! See, we have courage. “Sir, the child is dead!” “SED NOS QUI VIVIMUS” I How beautiful is life—the physical joy of sense and breathing; The glory of the world which has found speech and speaks to us; The robe which summer throws in June round the white bones of winter; The new birth of each day, itself a life, a world, a sun! II I love all things that are young and happy and eternal, Eternal in their change and growth as I too changing grow. Old am I, and how many voices that I loved are heard not! Yet the world lives, and in its life I live and laugh and love. III I woke to-day at daybreak, thrilled with a new sense of pleasure near me, Because a bird sang at my window and had ceased, afraid. A while I lay and listened conscious only of my being, The same fool school-boy as in days gone by, nerve, sinew, vein. IV Who tells us we are changed, that we with our wise years grow older? I am a poet, may be patriot, soldier, statesman, priest. Yet none the less I lay to-day and watched in childish wonder The flies tie and untie their knots, a mystery unrevealed. V The flies' way in the air perplexed me ever and perplexes No less this hour than in old time. So Solomon the wise, Spite of his wit, essayed in vain the riddle of the eagles; And I a child to-day lay there, a child, less than a child. VI And I heard tones well-known and prudent words and phrases ventured Gently to chide me for hours wasted thus in ease, Till I too spoke and vowed aloud new ways of life amended, And for the thousandth time in pain arraigned and blamed my dreams. VII Then I rose hastily, as one who hears and fears reproving, Although, God help me, there is living none now dares to chide or blame, And I broke through the curtain of the dusk, and from the Orient The sun's face through the window smiled, the lord of a new day. VIII How dare I grieve in the fair presence of the lord of morning? How dare I not rejoice who thus its king in Eden reign? God's peace is on this place proclaimed, and named, and promised, A sentient joy of living things which fills and thrills the Earth. IX Here all things joyous are. Birds breed in sedge and thicket; Hares feed in pairs, and squirrels leap from spray to spray; Dead limbs of elms make nests for the woodpeckers; The coots' cry from the mere comes loud and tells of rain. X Naught here may harm or hurt. This is a sanctuary For the world's weak, hedged in with love and fenced and sealed— Man its sole outcast, the earth's mad disturber branded Still with the mark of Cain and death from which life flees. XI Thus musing in my pride, and shame too somewhat, I descended, Led by invisible hands towards the trees and fields below. Along these self-same paths my childhood ran exulting, Following the poor lost dead who loved them as I love. XII What was their pride then in their leafy fair possession, Theirs in their day, who planned these glades and thickets round! How has their presence vanished from the silent pastures, The poor lost dead who held my hand and loved them as I love! XIII Yet not to mourn I came. No day of joy destroyed deserves our anguish. Pleasure's whole soul is this, to feel the living stream which flows. That which they did I do. In me they live unvanquished. My voice is theirs to-day, my step their step, my soul their soul. XIV For them I live ungrieving, and ungrieved their fruit I gather From trees they planted bravely in their pride of life and time. They fashioned these old gardens. Let my soul their joy inherit, Their passion heaped on passion, life on life, for my life's prize. XV Who were they all? Some names they bore well-known, some others fameless. A box of parchments yellow lies in the dull dust of age; A few poor letters, written by fond hands to fonder faces; Through all the passionate love of home, this home of mine, once theirs. XVI The primæval tiller of the soil enjoyed, the soil ancestral, Whence came he? What his lineage? Nay, 'tis hidden. Some have told Tales of high daring done, lands won, through lines remote descending From old Norse sources and the potent loins of kings and gods. XVII Or, with less pomp, of armoured knights, when knights were held heroic, Of prudent counsellors and priests and men revered for law, Dim-featured ghosts of vanished names set in forgotten story, Pleading for memory still of their last son through years of change. XVIII And yet I know not. Truth and fable here are strangely blended. Nay, rather let me set before my face in fancy one Like to myself, a clod of Sussex earth more kindly kneaded, And mostly noble through the love of right, the sense of wrong. XIX I see him stand beneath these pollard oaks, the same, hardhanded, With hook, and axe, and bill, a wrestler with the forest's green, A man grave-featured, dull of thought and wit, slow-paced, unyielding, Stern in his toil and niggard still of smile and sign and speech. XX The woodland round him a vast sea was then, whose scattered islands Were these few acres conquered hardly by men whole of heart, Spite of the demons and wild spectral elves that held the forest And deadly dragons haunting still in guile the undrained morass. XXI Who knows? A servant he, may be, of our good saint and patron, The cloistered friar, who for his life-long penance vowed and done, And for some monsters slain, had claimed in sole reward and guerdon The wood birds' silence round him while he made his prayer at noon. XXII How have the birds grown jubilant once more in song and godless, In these unchastened days when men have ceased to kneel or pray! This peasant knelt in faith. The world to him had nothing joyous. Death, like a spectre, dogged him close with fears of Heaven and Hell. XXIII And yet he loved these lands. Here haply a strange breadth of freedom Was from all lords and kings by reason of the forest fear. What warrior dared to search these “antres vast and desarts idle” For such poor scattered few freeholders as its fastness held? XXIV The Roman, Dane and Norman from the Down, their distant eyrie, Looked forth, but only looked. The swamps of trackless mire Clogged all their chariot wheels who dared by force of arms to venture With horse and spear and rider through these perilous bogs accursed. XXV And thus he lived and died, unknown to all, untamed, unlorded, This silent first forefather of the paternal woods reclaimed, Holding his place beneath the sun with sullen desperate caution On the square plot of up-turned acres that his spade had made. XXVI Lives there in me his son still something of his hardy sinew, Something of his heroic soul? Still darkly arched o'erhead The forest speaks to me, its child. I hoard and count and reckon As my birth's right and prize these lands, and look askance at men. XXVII Deep in my soul he lies. Nor less the rest, the crew penurious Of careful tillers holding gold achieved more dear than ease, The covetous of farms still grimly set through generations To add their store of value won to the ancestral fields. XXVIII The wealth they made that day is mine, the glades reclaimed, the hamlets, The treasure of the earth deep delved in reigns Plantagenet, The store of iron ore heaped high for needs of civil battle, When men in armour trod the flying heels of armèd men. XXIX Some gathered fortune boldly daring. Truce then to the forest. Some spent their store in lordly wassail, brawling and lewd wine. What anger was twixt neighbours there, twixt sire and son what contest! What bonds usurious countersigned enriched the hands of guile! XXX Still in their stubbornness of blood they stood, these my own fathers, Through whom the thread of life, a feeble cord by fortune spun And loosed upon Time's tempest, to their latest born descended, And with the life the lands redeemed which thus unshorn he loves. XXXI Justice, and squire, and clerk, and graduate of humaner letters! Here history spreads her written page for certain truth to record. On these green lawns rose novel shapes, trim walks and classic gardens Decked with Italian forms in stone of nymph and faun and god. XXXII Thus was I born. And lo, their golden leaves renewed each summer The oak trees weave for me as them, sublimely, blindly dumb, Holding their secrets closely shut, nor even to my cunning Yielding a word but this, “Alas for thee! and woe for Man!” XXXIII Woe for his valour, woe for thine! Time still shall all things vanquish, Folly and virtue, lusts of youth, mad griefs, sublime designs, The courage of high manhood feebly striving and then failing. Yonder behold the churchyard is, heaped high with thy own kind. XXXIV Here I broke off, in sudden exclamation loud disclaiming This new insistence of my foolish soul's disease of grief. The day's work calls me, to my soul I said, a day of labour, Or only laboured idleness yet clear at least of tears. XXXV Therewith I turned the latch before me of the low cow's-stable, Where, with her udders full and lowing loud to hear me near, Stood my cow Myrtle, large-eyed, moon-faced, brindlehided, patient, Waiting my footstep on the path which every morn she hears. XXXVI What does she meditate on all things, brute, divine and human, This mild-eyed mother? She too loves the knee-deep fields she knows With the same reasonless desire and natural greed of longing, And this between us hidden deep is a strong bond of love. XXXVII Her pulses can beat wildly too with rage and subtle passion When from her herd she strays. And once each Spring, with fortune cloyed, For a brief month she knows all Heaven's love and rapturous pleasure, Fondling the thing new born, which is her own, her soul, her joy. XXXVIII I love to touch the links of life between us, the blind kindness Of joy unreasoned, solace in the sun, in shade delight. The unhuman part of Man is still the best, his love of children, His love of meads and vales at home, his fondness for his kind. XXXIX Let me extenuate naught in thought, nor set down aught in malice. Here, Myrtle, is that thing thou lovest best, thy feed of corn. Give me in turn thy peace of soul, peace passing understanding, Thy trust each vain sweet day renewed sublime in Man thy god. XL How beautiful is life, the conscious power of thought in action, The brain's imperious will commanding fate within its sphere! Around it the world's forces, prisoned Jinns, obey the magician, Tamed and constrained for his delight their allotted tasks to weave. XLI And what were life unlabouring, life even here in this dear Eden, Were there no toil? Eternal perfectness in idle round Is God's sole lot to taste, not ours whom rage of hope possesses And Time disturbs with tales of change, and dark oblivion goads. XLII Our actions are our monument. The prince in slaughtered thousands Carves his red name on fields of war that he may sounder sleep. The Statesman fashions high his sluggard pride to patriot glories That he may lie entombed with kings while kings and kingdoms grieve. XLIII The prophet as of old speaks, “Rise, ye mourners, from your bondage, Get ye from hence and flee away afar lest evil come; Behold, the Lord shall lead you forth through deserts to new pastures, Thus shall ye do, and thus.” And he too sleeps his sleep with God. XLIV Nor less the poet. Chosen to sing of an eternal beauty, Dares he be silent in his day and leave his tale untold? How shall he wait on, idly, he a hireling without wages, Lest in the night untried of toil he wake and cry aloud? XLV There is a record given him he must needs in deeds accomplish, A tale of transient things his eyes have seen, his ears have heard; And he a traitor were if dying dumb they too should vanish, And fill the forgotten lapses lost of the unnumbered years; XLVI Memories of times departed, each hour filled to the brim with promise; Voices how sweet of human souls whose dreams are with them laid; Echoes of laughters fraught with tears, since joy has turned to sorrow; Footsteps of dancing feet long gone to rest where grasses wave; XLVII Tender, sad vows of women, how passionately appealing To eyes they loved, nor deeming day nor night itself too long For their blest service, sieging heaven amain in vain for pity, And holding earth and fate too strait for their wide arms of love; XLVIII Manly ambitions, vast as the high arch unspanned of heaven; Schemes of impossible good for Man, made naught by human fraud; Follies of valiant hearts cast forth upon the die of battle; Hopes of a world destroyed, made void through human greed of gold. XLIX I too have dreamed a dream which I would fain essay to interpret, A dream of infinite love, which, if my hour of wit were proved, Should stand my message to the world, a voice of power for ever, Binding the generations new to the past ages dumb. L How should I speak it best, in what high tones of fullvoiced reason Holding the souls of all? No idle lapse of empty sounds Should cloy the hearing of the earth grown deaf to alien passion, No clamour of vain sobs, no throbs, no formless dirge of words. LI But the true sculpture of a thought, clean cut and plain of meaning, Marble made life, with sinewy phrase and knotted argument, And that deep-throated resonant voice which in the morn of Egypt Spoke through her Memnon's lips to all, and all a nation heard. LII This should be prophecy—nay, judgment. But with less, if granted, Well were I winged for song, and luminous so in thought should move With the world's teachers, bards whose chosen strings have nobly chaunted Hymns of heroic Heaven or only this of human love. LIII Only that tragedy of hope, which in its full expansion Has never yet been told, the history of a human soul From its first outlook with blank eyes upon a world of shadows To its last blank farewell in tears upon a world of scorn; LIV The very truth of childhood, with its fears and tribulations, Hushed into sudden smiles and sleep by what unreasoning change; The wherefore and the why of its first bursts of causeless laughter; The meaning of its griefs untold, the sense of its first pain; LV And boyhood's early trust, thrust forth to the chill winds of schooling, Learning the bitterness of life through divers ways of loss, Wasting the freshness of its joys on noise, its first compassion On its own wounded back, till, turning, it too grasps the rod; LVI And youth's high hope, with painted dreams of all potential pleasure, Doubting which way to spring, the paths of honour leading here, There of delight, each robed with morning's virginal new vesture And beautiful with tears of love, though who should call them tears? LVII And manhood with its wars; and middle life as yet unvanquished, When strength is tried and, having learned through grief the nobler roads Of the world's glory, he beholds life's settled purpose, standing Calm with his fate, and seems to touch at last the ulterior goal; LVIII And then the pang which strikes, and the swift end. All these, in sequence, Would I set forth in words, tragic, severe, and each should breathe Of a new beauty, shade and light, blue skies, white clouds and tempests, Mountain and vale and plain and stream, and, circling all, Death's sea. LIX How beautiful is life! The present sense of souls that love us; The enfolding spirit of love, made known in divers silent ways; The wife, the child, the man and maid, whose zeal and faith enthrone us High in their temple niche enshrined! Thus angels serving stand. LX What need we of more love, of larger fields revealed of conquest, Who all things have that heaven itself in its reward might deal? What need we of new life, who touch the goal supreme of fortune, Holding to-day for prize the perfect love that casts out fear? LXI Come with me, child, who art myself, only a self grown dearer, One that I dare to love and without shame, for thou art mine. What shall our pleasure be to-day, our daily task being ended? Take thou a counsel of thy joy. Be thou my pleasure's guide. LXII Speak. Shall we make our visitation of the woods and forests? The midsummer shoot is there; and in their nuptial robes of green The oak trees murmur to the flies their tale of full-blown summer, And, where the stems were felled in Spring, the foxgloves point their spears. LXIII Or to the paddocks, deep in green for grazing steer and heifer, And, what we better love, those creatures of a nobler mould, Which are fair Nature's masterpiece and last supreme perfection, Mares with their unweaned foals high-souled in proud descent of blood. LXIV Or rather—let the indulgence to our idle souls be granted— Lapped in the summer heat, without more toil than this of dreams, On the lake's bosom moored, where birch and alder cast their shadows, Sit we and woo, hours through, with rod and line the mistrustful bream. LXV Here the boat lies, half hidden she, where three weeks since we left her, In her snug dog-wood nook. The rushes round have bound her in Already in their net. But we will free and float and set her, An ark for our new fortunes launched, to bear us where we will. LXVI See, there she swims. Our noise in loosing her has roused a heron, And with him teals and lapwings, with a cry of swift alarm. Ah Man! thy hated face disturbs once more thy natural fellows. What is thy kingship worth to thee if all things fly thy hand? LXVII The evil done is done, alas! Let us indulge our laughter, Dear Hester, sing to me that song the foolish fishes heard When you deceived them to their hurt by your unreal assurance, Telling of captive birds set free—the while the nets we spread. LXVIII Sing me a song, while I the happy oars in listless measure Ply looking at your face, and presently, when it is done, You shall hear stories told of far-off lands and strange adventures, Things that your father saw ere you to give him joy were born; LXIX Tales of great mountains where he set his steps in early manhood, Not hills like ours, but craggy pinnacles that pierce the clouds, Abysmal valleys and white slopes of treacherous ice, whose foothold Failed as in dreams men fail and urged him headlong down, LXX Falling for ever—ever—and yet saved by intervention, On the extreme curve's edge, of a miraculous softer snow, Wherein he bedded lay with beating heart till the slow rescue Gravely descending came and bore him scathless home; LXXI Or of the unlimited fields revealed of grey Arabian desert, Where are no streams or shade, but only the blind haze of noon, And the sun strikes with might, and the skins shrink which hold his blessing, The dole of water spared, his forfeit life if these be gone; LXXII Drear and untenanted. Yet see the sudden transformation When the Spring rains have come! In every vale and hollow there Cattle unnumbered pasture knee-deep down in purple blossoms, And the calf-camels prance, and their dams roar like souls in pain. LXXIII Or of days spent alone and nights in far Brazilian forests, Where sky and earth itself are lost in insolent depths of green. High overhead the laden tree-tops touch the extremest heaven, Leading through latticed walls of flowers and veils deepdripped with dew. LXXIV The impenetrable shadows dark of that shut place of silence How are they broken by the sheen and glint of insect wings, Bright coloured lamps slow flitting! Lo from the impervious thicket A blaze of blue, a butterfly, bursts flashing through the trees. LXXV Or last, of the vast hum of a tumultuous Indian city, Where street and bridge are thronged with men who sell and buy and cry, And women with bright eyes half veiled pass bearing flowers and incense, Through the tall temple gates set wide, to gods in ochreous shrines. LXXVI Strange wonderful and vast, till you forget the immediate beauty, The home we love, our little raptures over joys well known, This lake, these woods, this boat, the brook which tells of English summer With its mad bubbles dancing and its hazel foam windborne, LXXVII And all that was and is to fill our souls with their contentment From dawn to dusk. And so in joy this latest evening ends. God grant us length of days, of days like these to be remembered Till life's last night has come and we too gathered are in death! COSAS DE ESPAÑA SANCHO SANCHEZ I Sancho Sanchez lay a-dying in the house of Mariquita, For his life ebbed with the ebbing of the red wound in his side. And he lay there as they left him when he came from the Corrida In his gold embroidered jacket and his red cloak and his pride. II But at cockcrow in the morning, when the convents of Sevilla Suddenly rang loud to matins, Sanchez wakened with a cry, And he called to Mariquita, bade her summon his cuadrilla, That they all might stand around him in the hour when he should die. III For he thought in his bold bosom, “I have ventured with them often, And have led the way to honour upon every ring in Spain. And now in this the hardest of the fields that I have fought in I would choose that every face of them were witness of my pain. IV “For their stern eyes would upbraid me if I went down to the battle Without a friend to cheer me, or at least a fool to hiss. And they hold it all unworthy men should die like fatted cattle Stricken singly in the darkness at the shambles of Cadiz.” V Then he bade the lamps be lighted, and he made them bring a mirror, Lest his cheeks should have grown paler in the watches of the night. For he feared lest his disciples should mistrust his soul of terror, When they came to look upon him, if they saw his face was white. VI Oh, long time in the mirror did he look with awful smiling At the eyes which gazed out at him, while the women watched him mute. And he marked how death's white fingers had been clammily defiling The redness of God's image and had wiped the sunburns out. VII Then he spake, “Go fetch the carmine from the side drawer of the table, Where Mariquita keeps it.” But, when it was not found, “'Tis no matter,” answered Sanchez, “we must do what we are able.” And he painted his cheeks' paleness with the red blood of his wound. VIII And anon there came a murmur as of voices and a humming On the staircase, and he knew them by their footsteps at the door. And he leant up on his pillow that his eyes might see them coming In their order of the plaza as they strode across the floor. IX And when they stood around him, in their stately mantas folded, With a solemn grief outawing the brute laughter of their eyes, You had deemed them in the lamplight to be bronzen statues moulded Of the powers of Nature yielding a brave man in sacrifice. X But the soul of Sanchez quailed not, and he laughed in their sad faces, Crying loud to Mariquita for the Valdepeñas wine. “A fair pig-skin, Caballeros, blushes here for your embraces. And I drink to you your fortune, and I pray you drink to mine.” XI Then they filled their leathern flagons, and they held them up together In a ghastly expectation till their chief should give the sign. And the red wine in the silence flowed like blood adown the leather. And the red blood from the pillow trickled drop by drop like wine. XII Spake the Master, “Ere I pledge you, look upon me, men, and hearken, For I have a thing to utter, and a dying man is wise. Death is weighing down my eyelids. Silently your faces darken. But another torch is lighted than the daylight in my eyes. XIII “Life, I see it now as never I had thought to comprehend it, Like the lines which old Manola used to write upon the sand, And we looked on in wonder nor guessed till it was ended The birds and trees and faces which were growing from her hand. XIV “Meaning was there from the outset, glorious meaning in our calling, In the voice of emulation and our boyhood's pride of soul, From the day when first, the capa from our father's shoulders falling, We were seized with inspiration and rushed out upon the bull. XV “Meaning was there in our courage and the calm of our demeanour, For there stood a foe before us which had need of all our skill. And our lives were as the programme, and the world was our arena, And the wicked beast was death, and the horns of death were hell. XVI “And the boast of our profession was a bulwark against danger With its fearless expectation of what good or ill may come, For the very prince of darkness shall burst forth on us no stranger When the doors of death fly open to the rolling of the drum. XVII “As I lay here in the darkness, I beheld a sign from Heaven: Standing close a golden angel by the footpost of my bed, And in his hand a letter with the seal and arms engraven Of the glorious San Fernando which he bade me read and read. XVIII “And the message of his master, the blessed king my patron, Was to bid me in his honour to hold myself at need For this very day and morning of his feast and celebration, And in pledge of his high favour he had sent me his own steed. XIX “For the lists of Heaven were open, and that day they had decreed it There should be a special function for the glory of his name. And the beasts were Sevillanos, and a master's hand was needed Lest the swords of Heaven should falter and the Saint be put to shame. XX “And I heard the potro stamping in the street, and would have risen But that Mariquita held me and the women and my wound. And, though the angel left me, it was truth and not a vision, And I know the Saint has called me, and the place where I am bound. XXI “I shall fight this day in Heaven, and, though all Hell shall assail me, I have hope of a good issue, for perhaps I have some skill, And perhaps, if I should stumble or if my hand should fail me, There are others in the plaza who have vowed me less than ill. XXII “And my mantle of salvation is the faith which is our charter, And the Virgin of the Pillar my protector and reward, And the hosts of Heaven my witness and each Spanish Saint and Martyr, And our lord Don Santiago himself has lent the sword.” XXIII Thus he spoke, and on his speaking fell a silence and a wonder, While the eyes of his companions turned in awe from each to each, And they waited in expectance for the gates to roll asunder And the voices of the angels to command him to the breach,— XIV Waited till the sun uprising sent his glory through the chamber, And the spent lamps paled and flickered on the shame of their dismay, And the dying man transfigured passed in silence from his slumber, Like a king to coronation, in the light of his new day. XXV Only they that stood the closest say the pale lips curved and parted, And the eyes flashed out in battle, and the fingers sought the sword. “'Tis the President has called him,” said Fernandez the true hearted, “He has thrown his hat behind him for the glory of the Lord!” ACROSS THE PAMPAS I Dost thou remember, oh, dost thou remember, Here as we sit at home and take our rest, How we went out one morning on a venture In the West? II Hast thou forgotten, in these English hedgerows, How the great Pampas rolled out like the sea? Never a daisy in that mighty meadow! Never a tree! III Full were our hearts upon that sunny morning; Stout-handed and stout-hearted went we forth. The warm wind in our faces breathed us fortune From the North; IV And high in heaven the sun stood for a token. We had no other sign by which to steer. No landmark is there in the Earth's great ocean, For mariner. V Dost thou remember how, when night was falling, There in the middle plain, as best we might, We set our little tent up as a fortress For the night? VI Dost thou remember how, through the night watches, We listened to the voices of the plain, The owls and plovers and the bold bischachas, Talking like men? VII Drowsy we sat, and watched our horses feeding, Dim through the night, while over the tent's mouth The Cross was turning like a clock and reeling In the South. VIII But, as the night grew out and we grew chilly, Under our blankets safe we crept and warm, Full of good heart and each with loaded pistols Close to his arm; IX And so dreamed pleasant dreams of far off faces, And trees and fields which we had loved in youth, All in a maze of present apprehension Mingled uncouth; X And how we travelled on and ever onwards, Still in the red path of the setting sun, Until into the heart of a great woodland We had come; XI And there saw, round about our strange encampment, Flocks of bright birds which flew and screamed at us, Red cardinals and woodpeckers and parrots Multitudinous; XII And on the lake black-headed swans were sailing, And in the morning to the water's brink Flamingoes, like the rising sun, came wading Down to drink. XIII Dost thou remember, oh, dost thou remember How, in that fatal wood, the mancaròn Found out a poisonous herb before his fellows, And fed thereon; XIV And how we left him, and how Cæsar sickened, And how the sky grew dark and overcast, And how two tragic days we rode on silent In the blast; XV And how the wind grew icy and more icy, Until we could not feel our hands or feet, As sick at heart we sought in vain a hiding From the sleet; XVI Lighting at last on a deserted post-house, Where we found shelter from the wind, but nought Of entertainment for our souls or comfort Of any sort; XVII And how in that wild pass brave Cæsar dying Stretched out his arm towards the promised land, And saw as in a dream the white hills lying Close at hand,— XVIII For, ere the sun set, suddenly that evening, The great plain opened out beneath our feet, And, in a valley far below, lay gleaming, With square and street, XIX And spire and dome and pinnacle, uprising White on the bosom of a mountain slope, To our amazement bodily the city Of our hope. XX Dost thou remember, oh, dost thou remember How the bells rang as, sick and travel-worn, A weary crew, we made our solemn entry To the town? XXI Strangely, as phantoms out of the great desert, We came into the city, and at last Heard sound of Christian singing in the churches As we passed: XXII And laid at length our weary limbs in rapture Between the clean sheets of a Christian bed. Oh! there are things I think we shall remember When we are dead! BODY AND SOUL A METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENT Man openeth the case Body, from the arrogance Of the Soul thou seekest shield, Makest prayer the old mis-chance Of your birth-bond be repealed, Since, sayest thou, the Soul would wield Sovereign power and looks askance At her partner in life's dance. Tell me, Soul, why claimest thou, Of what right, this sovereignty? Wherefore dost thou cloud thy brow, This thy partner standing nigh? Scorn is written in thine eye Watching him. Speak plain and show All thy plaint that I may know. The Soul speaketh Judge most just! Wouldst ask of me My being's secret? Ask the fire Why he is kindled in the tree, And why his flames mount high and higher In scorn of the poor tortured pyre Which feedeth him. Ask why the Sea Thus frets her bed eternally. The flames their kindred flames would reach; The waves leap up towards the Moon, And when they foam upon the beach Grow pale like her. From morn to noon The sun-flower turneth with the Sun. A power there is in all and each Should lesson thee what I would teach. For I am subtle as the air Which stirs the tree-tops, scattering wide The feathered seed-blooms everywhere And ordering all, itself unspied, And is unchanged while all beside Change and decay. In me no share Is of the death these others bear. Simple in essence I, to thee Known but as one exiled by Fate From her old home Eternity, And sunk awhile from her estate And bound to a material mate, Through whose gross shape and quality Alone my worth revealed may be. Yet, shall I doubt me of the power, Inborn in me, to seek a throne, Although I stumble toward the hour Which waits with death, my penance done, Body to naught and I to run Simple and unconditioned nor On quality dependent more? Or is faith nothing? O I feel Pity for this poor thing of dust; And that is why I bid him kneel And be ennobled, for he must Kneel first before his queen in trust. Then would I strike him with my steel And bind my spurs upon his heel. But his mistrust defieth me, His striving still against the bond Which joineth us, nor will he see Our wisdom must be straight uncrowned, And he but perish of the wound, In such divorcement were he free. This is my secret, this my plea. The Judge questioneth Body, hast thou heard aright How Soul thus doth thee deny? She hath claimed in thy despite Being from Eternity. Hast thou ancestry as high? Tell thy title, thou sad wight, Else her claim will I requite. Body replieth Wouldst thou know my lineage? Look around thee. Thou shalt trace From form to form, from age to age, Fossil records of my race. I, the latest, claim my place Engrossed on Earth's ancestral page By right inscribed of heritage. Tell me, in those days long gone Where was Soul? What then her power? If to-day she claims a throne, Was she fashioned me before? Both of us old Matter bore. I the elder was, Time's son, Ages vast ere Soul was known. Soul came later. My male might Shielded her in her first cell, She a frail fair anchorite, Guarded by my valiance well, Silent, sanct, intangible. All my joy she was, and light, A new dawning on my night. Thus the out-set. Tryst we kept In good concord I and she. Mine the strength which overstepped Her weak life's propinquity. Or we yielded mutually; I was weary and she slept, She was wounded and I wept. Happy days of growth. Ah why Must change come with pride of youth? She was eager, slow-foot I, Glorious she, I all uncouth. Her new wit showed little ruth, Threw out cunning wings to fly, Made as she would pass me by. And when she found she could not win Alone upon the blast of Time, It irked her we were counted kin, Until she held it me a crime I should be matched with one sublime And noble as she fain had been, And last she claimed to be my queen. Therefore from her arrogance And her pride I make appeal Praying this the ordinance Of our birth-bond, grown unleal, Thou wouldst cancel or make real. Be our judge in this mis-chance; Else decree deliverance. Judgement is given I am but by your union. With either Soul or Body lost, All perisheth. Then work ye on Together friends, not corpse and ghost. To live and be is a brave boast. Learn this; alone ye nothing can, Yet both together ye make Man. THE GOLDEN ODES OF PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIA IMR EL KÁIS Weep, ah weep love's losing, love's with its dwelling-place set where the hills divide Dakhúli and Háumali. Túdiha and Mikrat! There the hearths-stones of her stand where the South and North winds cross-weave the sand-furrows. See the white-doe droppings strewn by the wind on them, black on her floors forsaken, fine-grain of peppercorns. Here it was I watched her, lading her load-camels, stood by these thorn-trees weeping tears as of colocynth. Here my twin-friends waited, called to me camel-borne: Man! not of grief thou diest. Take thy pain patiently. Not though tears assuage thee, deem it beseemeth thee thus for mute stones to wail thee, all thy foes witnesses. What though fortune flout thee! Thus Om Howéyrith did, thus did thy Om Rebábi, fooled thee in Másali. O, where these two tented, sweet was the breath of them, sweet as of musk their fragrance, sweet as garánfoli. Mourned I for them long days, wept for the love of them, tears on my bosom raining, tears on my sword-handle. Yet, was I unvanquished. Had I not happiness, I, at their hands in Dáret, Dáret, of Júljuli? O that day of all days! Slew I my milch-camel, feasted the maidens gaily: well did they load for me! Piled they high the meat-strings. All day they pelted me, pelted themselves with fatness, fringes of camel-meat. Climbed I to her howdah, sat with Onéyzata, while at my raid she chided: Man! Must I walk afoot? Swayed the howdah wildly, she and I close in it: There! my beast's back is galled now. Slave of Grief, down with thee. Answered I: Nay, sweet heart, loosen the rein of him. Think not to stay my kisses. Here will I harvest them. Grieve not for thy camel. Grudge not my croup-riding. Give me—and thee—to taste things sweeter than clove-apples, Kisses on thy white teeth, teeth, nay the pure petals, even and clean and close-set, wreathing a camomile. Wooed have I thy equals, maidens and wedded ones. Her, the nursling's mother, did I not win to her? What though he wailed loudly, babe of the amulets, turned she not half towards him, half of her clasped to me? Woe is me, the hard heart! How did she mock at me, high on the sand-hill sitting, vowing to leave and go! Fátma, nay, my own love, though thou wouldst break with me, still be thou kind awhile now, leave me not utterly. Clean art thou mistaken. Love is my malady. Ask me the thing thou choosest. Straight will I execute. If so be thou findest ought in thy lover wrong, cast from thy back my garments, moult thee my finery. Woe is me, the hard heart! When did tears trouble thee, save for my soul's worse wounding, stricken and near to die? Fair too was that other, she the veil-hidden one, howdahed how close, how guarded! Yet did she welcome me. Passed I twixt her tent-ropes: what though her near-of-kin lay in the dark to slay me, blood-shedders all of them. Came I at the mid-night, hour when the Pleiades showed as the links of seed-pearls binding the sky's girdle. Stealing in, I stood there. She had cast off from her every robe but one robe, all but her night-garment. Tenderly she scolded: What is this stratagem? Speak, on thine oath, thou mad one. Stark is thy lunacy. Passed we out together, while she drew after us on our twin track to hide it, wise, her embroideries, Fled beyond the camp-lines. There in security dark in the sand we lay down far from the prying eyes. By her plaits I wooed her, drew her face near to me, won to her waist how frail-lined, hers of the ankle-rings. Fair-faced she—no redness—noble of countenance, smooth as of glass her bosom, bare with its necklaces. Thus are pearls yet virgin, seen through the dark water, clear in the sea-depths gleaming, pure, inaccessible. Coyly she withdraws her, shows us a cheek, a lip, she a gazelle of Wújra: yearling the fawn with her. Roe-like her throat slender, white as an áriel's, sleek to thy lips up-lifted: pearls are its ornament. On her shoulders fallen thick lie the locks of her, dark as the dark date-clusters hung from the palm-branches. See the side-plaits pendent, high on the brows of her, tressed in a knot, the caught ones fast with the fallen ones. Slim her waist: a well-cord scarce has its slenderness. Smooth are her legs as reed-stems stripped at a water-head. The morn through she sleepeth, musk-strewn in indolence, hardly at noon hath risen, girded her day dresses. Soft her touch: her fingers fluted as water-worms, sleek as the snakes of Thóbya, tooth-sticks of 'Ishali. Lighteneth she night's darkness, ay, as an evening lamp hung for a sign of guidance lone on a hermitage. Who but shall desire her, seeing her standing thus, half in her childhood's short frock, half in her woman's robe! Strip thee of youth's fooling, thou in thy manhood's prime. Yet to her love be faithful: hold it a robe to thee. Many tongues have spoken, warned me of craft in love. Yet have they failed an answer: all were thine enemies. Dim the drear night broodeth: veil upon veil let down, dark as a mad sea raging, tempting the heart of me. Spake I to Night stoutly, while he, a slow camel, dragged with his hind-feet halting: gone the forehand of him. Night! I cried, thou snail Night, when wilt thou turn to day? When? Though in sooth day's dawning worse were than thou to me. Sluggard Night, what stays thee? Chained hang the stars of thee, fast to the rocks with hempen ropes set un-movable. Water-skins of some folk—ay, with the thong of them laid on my nága's wither—borne have I joyfully, Crossed how lone the rain-ways, bare as an ass-belly: near me the wolf, starved gamester, howled to his progeny. Cried I: Wolf, thou wailest. Surely these lives of ours, thine and my own, go empty, robbed of prosperity. All we won we leave here. Whoso shall follow us, seed in our corn-track casting, reap shall he barrenness. Rode I forth at day-dawn: birds in their nests asleep: stout on my steed, the sleek-coat, him the game-vanquisher. Lo, he chargeth, turneth,—gone is he—all in one, like to a rock stream-trundled, hurled from its eminence. Red-bay he: his loin-cloth chafing the ribs of him shifts as a rain-stream smoothing stones in a river-bed. Hard is he: he snorteth loud in the pride of him, fierce as a full pot boiling, bubbling beneath the lid. Straineth he how stoutly, while, as spent fishes swim, tied to his track the fleet ones plough his steps wearily. See, in scorn he casteth youth from the back of him, leaveth the horseman cloakless, naked the hard-rider. As a sling-stone hand-whirled, so is the might of him, loosed from the string that held it, hurled from the spliced ribbon. Lean his flanks, gazelle-like, legs as the ostrich's; he like a strong wolf trotteth; lithe as a fox-cub he. Stout his frame; behind him, look, you shall note of him full-filled the hind-leg gap, tail with no twist in it. Polished, hard his quarters, smooth as the pounding-stone used for a bridegroom's spices, grind-slab of colocynth. As the henna juice lies dyed on a beard grown hoar, so on his neck the blood-stains mark the game down-ridden. Rushed we on the roe-herd. Sudden, as maids at play circling in skirts low-trailing, forth leaped the does of it. Flashing fled they, jewels, shells set alternately on a young gallant's neck-string, his the high pedigreed. Yet he gained their leaders, far while behind him lay bunched in a knot the hindmost, ere they fled scatterwise. 'Twixt the cow and bull herds held he in wrath his road; made he of both his booty: sweatless the neck of him. All that day we roasted, seethed the sweet meat of them, row upon row in cauldrons, firelighters all of us. Nathless home at night-fall, he in the fore-front still. Where is the eye shall bind him? How shall it follow him? The night through he watcheth, scorneth him down to lay, close, while I sleep, still saddled, bridled by side of me. Friend, thou seest the lightning. Mark where it wavereth, gleameth like finger s twisted, clasped in the cloud-rivers. Like a lamp new-lighted, so is the flash of it, trimmed by a hermit nightly pouring oil-sésame. Stood I long a watcher, twin-friends how dear with me, till in Othéyb it faded, ended in Dáriji. By its path we judged it: rain over Káttan is; far in Sitár it falleth, streameth in Yáthboli. Gathereth gross the flood-head dammed in Kutéyfati. Woe to the trees, the branched ones! Woe the kanáhboli! El Kanáan hath known it, quailed from the lash of it. Down from their lairs it driveth hot-foot the ibexes. Known it too hath Téyma; standeth no palm of her there, nor no house low-founded,—none but her rock-buildings. Stricken stood Thabíra whelmed by the rush of it, like an old chief robe-folded, bowed in his striped mantle. Nay, but he Mujéymir, tall-peaked at dawn of day, showed like a spinster's distaff tossed on the flood-water. Cloud-wrecked lay the valley piled with the load of it, high as in sacks the Yemámi heapeth his corn-measures. Seemed it then the song-birds, wine-drunk at sun-rising, loud through the valley shouted, maddened with spiceries, While the wild beast corpses, grouped like great bulbs uptorn, cumbered the hollow places, drowned in the night-trouble. TÁRAFA The tent lines these of Kháula in stone-stricken Tháhmadi. See where the fire has touched them, dyed dark as the hands of her. 'Twas here thy friends consoled thee that day with thee comforting, cried; Not of grief, thou faint-heart! Men die not thus easily. Ay, here the howdahs passed thee at day-dawn, how royally! stood for the Dédi pastures: a white fleet they seemed to thee, Ships tall-rigged from Adáuli—of Yámin the build of them— wandering wide the night through, to meet at the sunrising. Thus climbed they the long wave-lines, their prows set how loftily! ploughing the drifted ridges, sand heaped by the sandseers. Alas for the dark-lipped one, the maid of the topazes, hardly yet grown a woman, sweet fruit-picking loiterer! A girl, a fawn still fawnless, which browses the thorn-bushes, close to the doe-herd feeding, aloof in the long valleys. I see her mouth-slit smiling, her teeth,—nay, a camomile white on the white sand blooming and moist with the night-showers. Sun-steeped it is, pure argent, white all but the lips of her, these are too darkly painted to shrink from the sunburning. The face of her how joyous, the day's robe enfolding her, clean as a thing fresh fashioned, untouched by sad time-fingers. Enough! New joys now claim me. Ay, mount and away from her! Here on my swift-foot camel I laugh at love's bitterness. Ship-strong is she, my nága, my stout-timbered road-goer, footing the long-lined path-way—a striped cloak—in front of us. Steel tempered are her sinews. She runs like an ostrich-hen, one which has fled defying the ash-plumed proud lord of her. Out-paces she the best-born, shank still on shank following, threading the mazes lightly. Ah, what foot shall follow her? The spring-long on Kufféyn she has wandered, her kind with her, pastured in pleasant places, the rain-watered thyme-valleys, Has turned to her herd's calling, aloft in wrath brandishing, scared by the thick-furred red thief, that proud tuft the tail of her. Her tail sways this and that way—a falcon, the wings of him bating her flanks impatient: erect stands the bone of it— So lasheth she in anger anon her croup-rider's knee, then her own shrunken udder, a drought-withered water-skin. Note well her limbs' perfection, her thighs like the elbow-worn jambs of a city gateway, two smooth shafts of porphyry. Her barrel, a stone well-mouth, like bent bows the curves of it, caved where the neck-shaft enters, ends in an arched hollow. Deep dens are her two arm-pits, a tree-trunk with cavities. Bows are her rib-bones bended, her spine the hands holding them. Her elbows are twin buckets, the pails of a water-man wide-set, the neck between them the strong man who carries them. Bridge-like, and Roman-builded! How swore he its architect none should leave work or loiter, its key-stone unlaid by them! Red chestnut is her chin-tuft, a vast vault the back of her. Swift-step her hind-feet follow the path of her fore-footing. Her legs are a cord twisted. Towards them the arms of her slant from the shoulders outward, a tent-roof the slope of them. So sways she, the strong-skulled one, and lightly her shoulder blades rise from her spine alternate, arhyme with the march of her. Like rain-pools in the smooth rock, so, flecking the sides of her, white stand the girth-marks, witness once of the sores on them. Her neck, how tall, how proud-set! Behold her! She raises it high as in ships of Díjleh the point of a stern-rudder. Her head-piece a stout anvil, and, joined to it hardily sharp as a file the neck-ridge, fixed as a vice to it. Her jowl a Syrian parchment, clean vellum the lip of her, smooth as a hide of Yémen, no skin-crease nor fold in it. Her eyes two mirrors shining, her bent brows the shade of them, pitted with deep-set hollows, as rock-holes for rain-water. Eyes dark-rimmed, pure of dust-stains. You gaze in the depths of them as in a wild cow's wide eyes, scared for the calf of her. Ears fearful of the night-sounds, the whispers, the murmurings caught in the darkness passing—night—day: they can rest never. Their thorn-tips tell her lineage, a wild bull's of Háumala raging alone forsaken; her breeding you read in them. Heart watchful of strange dangers, yet stout in the face of them. Firm as a test-stone standing where cleft lie the base pebbles. Lip slit, nose pierced for nose-ring, how slender its cartilage! Nobly she lowers it running and stretched to the front of her. I strike at her, my nága: I force her: I hurry her, while in our path the false-lights lure us to follow them. The gait of her how rhythmic! She sways like a dancing-girl, one with the white skirts trailing, who bends to the lord of her. Obedient to your riding, she slackens her outrunning, watches the hide-thong twisted, the speed that you need of her. Her head by your hand close held, your knee-crutch how near to it! Then with her fore-arms swimming, an ostrich, she flies with you. Thus rode I, and thus spake he, the friend of my tear-sheddings: O for the wit to cure thee, but and my own sorrows! His soul within him trembled; it seemed to his hardihood death and a sure destruction, though far we from roadfarers. For which of us is valiant? When men speak of true valour, I feel my own the name named. Straight am I roused by it. No recreant I, my tent-ridge I hide from no enemy. Nor in the far hills build it who bring men a swift succour. The hand that seeks shall find me. I stand at the gatherings. Ay, where men tap the wine-skin, 'tis there they shall speak with me. What day the tribes assemble, behold me conspicuous, sitting as fits my lineage, nor go I in fear of them. Beside me my companions, bright stars of nobility. Dyed is her robe with saffron the girl who pours out to us. O sweet is her shirt's neck-slit, set wide to the eyes of us. Soft is the thing it hides there. We bade her: Now, sing to us. Ay sing to us: we prayed her. And she, with monotony striking a low note slowly, chaunted unchangingly. O strange it was that cadence: it came back the wail of it, grave as a mother's grieving the one son new-slain from her. Thus sang she. And I spared not the full cups of revelry, not till my spoil was wasted, my whole wealth's inheritance. Then left me they that loved me. Then shunned me my tribe-fellows. Sat I alone forsaken, a mange-stricken male camel. Nathless the poor showed pity, the sons of Earth's particles, these and the alien tent-lords, the far chiefs befriended me. You only did revile me. Yet, say, ye philosophers, was that same wealth eternal I squandered in feasting you? Could all you my fate hinder? Friends, run we ahead of it, rather our lives enjoying, since Time will not wait for us. And, truly, but for three things in youth's day of vanity, fain would I see them round me the friends at my deathbedding, As first: to outstrip the sour ones, be first at the winebibbing, ay, at the blink of day-dawn when mixed the cup foams for me; And next, to ride their champion, who none have to succour them, fierce on my steed, the led one, a wolf roused and thirst-stricken; And third, to lie the day-long, while wild clouds are wildering, close in her tent of goat's hair, the dearest beloved of me. O noble she, a tree-stem unpruned in her maidenhood, tall as a branch of Khírwa, where men hang their ornaments. 'Tis thus I slake my soul's rage, the life-thirst so wild in me. If we two died to-morrow, think, which would go thirstier? For lo, his grave the miser's! Lo, next it the prodigal's! Both are alike, scant favour to hoarder or squanderer. 'Neath mounds of earth the twain lie, a low stone atop of them, heavy and broad and shapeless, with new slabs o'erlaying it. Death is no subtle chooser. He takes all, the free-givers, ay, and the rogues close-fisted, the fast-handed goldhiders. And life's heap lies unguarded. The night-thieves make spoil of it. All that these leave the day-thieves straightway come plundering. Nay, by thy life—I swear it, though fast fly the heels of him, Death has a lead-rope round him, loose though it seem to you. Ha! How is this? My kinsman? my fool-cousin Máleki? Daily, as I draw near him, he turns his mad back on me. He frowns I know not wherefore. He flouts me, as once with them Kurt, in the face of all men, flouted and jibed at me. His help he has denied me; and, truly, our brotherhood tried in the fire of asking lies dead in love's sepulchre. My word his words discredit. Yet all I for Mábadi asked was a poor assistance to gather his lost camels, I who hold fast to kinship. I swear by the luck of thee, when they shall want hard riding, that day they shall fawn on me, What day their tribes need succour, when loudly their womenfolk cry from his hand the oppressor's to hands that are mightier. Be but their honour tainted, I straight will pour out for them death as from brimming cisterns, nor ask for an argument. They rail at and revile me, who know me no ill-doer; me, who have borne their burdens, cast would they out from them. Yet, had my friend been other, this Málek of larger soul, long had my pain been ended, a respiting found for me. Shame on him for his baseness. His black hand would strangle me, whether I thanked or sued him, or turned but my back on him. O cruel is the sword-stroke: it bites with an Indian edge: yet is their temper keener, the clowns I call kin to me. Then leave me to my own ways, my tent set in Dárghadi, far from the eyes of all men, and earn thee my gratitude. Had he, the Lord, so willed it, my name had been Khálidi, or had he willed it Ámer, or Káis, or Márthadi. Wealth had been mine and increase, ay, all that men most covet, sons as a gift of heaven, a proud-lined posterity. Yet see me a man subtle, one lithe-souled and lithe-bodied, quick as a snake for wounding, whose head is a hurt to them. The oath my tongue has sworn to is this, to keep close to me ever my sword-blade loosened; of Indies the edge of it. Such blade, if I take vengeance and rise up and smite with it, needs not a second down-stroke; I wield me no wood-chopper. My sword is my true brother. It grudges no blood-spilling. Called on to spare, it answers: My lord alone holdeth me. Thus was I when men armed them and rushed to the battle-field: grasped I my sword-hilt foremost, nor feared what fate doomed for me. Herds knelt, their necks stretched earth-long. How scared them the eyes of me, me with my sword drawn marching, its sheath cast away from me. There passed a strong fair nága, a full-uddered milch-camel, joy of her lord, the gray-beard, a hot man, though time-troubled. He shouted when she fell there, her stout sinews houghed by me: Man, art thou blind who seest not thy sword hath done robbery? He spake, and to his friends turned: Behold him, this wine-bibber! What is his rage against us, his wild words, his drinkfolly? Yet paused: Nay, give him wide room and leave it to profit him: herd we the scared ones rather, lest more he should slay of them. Then fell the maids aroasting its fair flesh the foal of her, nor of the fat denied us, the whole hump our prize of it. We cast the arrows gaily, the dun shafts, the fire-hardened: each time the holder held them, straightway I won with them. When I am dead, speak kindly, thou daughter of Mábadi: rend for my sake thy garments as one worth the love of thee. Nor count me with the lewd folk, the night-knaves, the roysterers, men with nor wit nor wisdom nor will to do weightily, Men slow to deeds of virtue, men swift but in ill-doing, men by the brave held lightly, with spread palms and brow-knitting. For, had I been a weakling, know well, their mad hate of me long had been my destruction, their blind wrath my butchery. Only it wards me from them the fear of my hand's valour, this, and my faith untainted, my fame too of ancestry. Once on a time I bound me with vows, on the battlefield ever to guard the weak posts, points where the foe threatened, Points where the bravest faltered, where pale men stood panic-struck, where they the strong-hearts trembled, faint through the fear in them. Nay, by thy life, I fear not. I hold not time weariness; neither hath day distressed me, nor night what it brought to me. Because I see Death spares none. It smites with an even hand, bows not to names exalted, nor knows it men's dignities; Because with Death behind me, my flight can avail me not, neither can I outwit him, he lying in wait for me. Because if one be proved vain by those who seek aid of him, helpless to hurt the harmful, better he perishèd. The days to come, what are they? A handful, a borrowing: vain is the thing thou fearest. To-day is the life of thee. And death is as a well-spring; to it men pass and pass: near them is each to-morrow; near them was yesterday. Only shall Age, the slow-foot, arraign thee of ignorance: only shall One bring tidings, when least thou desirest him, One who is hard to deal with, of whom thou art ransomer neither for pay nor raiment, nor madest thou tryst with him. ZOHÉYR Woe is me for 'Ommi 'Aufa! Woe for the tents of her lost on thy stony plain, Durráj, on thine, Mutethéllemi! In Rákmatéyn I found our dwelling, faint lines how desolate, tent-markstraced like the vein-tracings blue on the wrists of her. Large-eyed there the wild-kine pastured, white roes how fearlessly, leaped, their fawns beside them, startled: I in the midst of them. Twenty years abroad I wander. Lo, here I stand to-day, hardly know the remembered places, seek I how painfully. Here our hearth-stones stand, ay, blackened still with her cooking-pots, here our tent-trench squarely graven, grooved here our camel-trough. Love, when my eyes behold thy dwelling, to it I call aloud: Blessed be thou, O house of pleasure, greeting and joy to thee! Friend of my soul! Dost thou behold them? Say, are there maidens there, camel-borne, high in their howdahs, over the Júrthum spring? Say, are their curtains lined with scarlet, sanguine embroideries, veiling them from eyes of all men, rose-tinted coverings? Slantwise up El Subáan they mounted: high-set the pass of it. With them the new-born morning's beauty, fair-faced and fortunate. At the blink of dawn they rose and laded. Now, ere the sun is up, point they far to Wády Ras, straight as hand points to mouth. Joy! Sweet joy of joys! Fair visions, human in tenderness, dear to the human eye that truly sees them and understands! As the scarlet fringe of fénna seed-pods no lip hath browsed upon, so is the dye of their scarlet wool new-fringing the camping-grounds. And they came to the watering pool in the red rocks: blue-black the depths of it. And they planted the tent-poles, straight and fairly, firm for a dwelling-place. They have left Kanáan on the far right hand: dark-crowned the crest of it. How many foes in El Kanáan! And friends, too, ah, how many! But they came to El Subáan in their might, impetuous, beautiful, they in their howdahs of scarlet wool. O friend, dost thou look on them? I have sworn by the most illustrious dwelling, shrine of processioners, house revered of Koréysh and Júrhum, founded in piety. I have sworn my praise to the two chieftains, men of what hardihood, prompt todo when need shall call them, light deeds and doughty deeds. Strove ye well, ye Lords of Mórra, what though the clans of you long had drwoned in blood their friendship, drowned it in war-clamours. Ye with Abs and Dóbián that day ye persuaded them, spite of feud and their death-dealing perfumes of mínshami. For thus ye spake: Let peace be garnered, all the fair wealth of it, based onpay and fair exchanges, ours to establish it. Theirs the peace and yours the glory, high names and dignities, you the nobletwain prevailing, purging the rage of them. Lo, in Maád ye stand exalted, ye the high-guided ones. He who a booty brings of glory, shall he not share in it? Healing of wounds ye dealed in hundreds, hundreds of debt-camels, guiltless you for the death-guilty, ending the feud of them. Tribe and tribe, you paid the ransom, what though the hands of you clean were of blood and the red shedding, ay, the least cup of it. Yet ye brought the payment bravely, all your fair heritage, camels yours by right of plunder, these and your earmarked ones. Ho! To the oath-bound tribes a greeting: Have ye not sworn to it? Ay, and to Dóbián a message: Will ye not keep the peace? For you may not hide from God your dealings, what though in secrecy deep in your heart of hearts you seal it. Nathless He knoweth it, Knoweth and taketh note in patience, sure of His reckoning till the day of the great counting, waiteth or hasteneth. War! Ye have learned it all, its teachings, well have ye tasted them. These no tales are that I tell you. Each is a certainty. A smouldering coal ye flung it lightly, blindly despising it. Lo, into raging flame it leapeth, wind-lit, destroyeth you. Ye are ground as corn by Hate's ill-grinding, flat on her grinding-skin. Nay, a too fruitful camel she. Twins hath she borne to you, Sinister sons of fear and anger, milk-fed on bitterness; dark as his, Aád's, their nursing. Lo, she is weaned of them. And her hand is large to rain you harvests, evil the wealth of them. No such plenty Irák hath garnered, hell-grain and hate-money. Ay, by my life, the kin was noble. Yet did it fare with them ill when they the peace-terms flouted. Démdem's the sin of it, His, Huséyn's, who held his counsel, hiding the thought in him, yielding naught and naught revealing, steeled in his stubbornness. For he thought: My end will I accomplish. No ill shall come to me, fenced and armed, with might behind me, warriors, horse-riders. Proud he stood, nor feared the tent-lords, what though Om-Káshami watched them near, the vulture-mother, eyeing the multitude. Strode he forth, full-armed, a wild beast, fierce for the blood-letting, mane and claws unclipped, a lion. Who shall his anger brave? Fearless, one who doth his vengeance swift on his wrongdoer, one who unassailed yet rendeth, he the first injurer. And they pastured there their fair milch-camels, drove to the waterings, drank of the full pools brimming over, gall in the hearts of them, This side and that by blood divided, rank hate the meat of them, poison-grass to their herds' hurting, mired in blood-bitterness. Yet, by thy life, not these the guilty. Clean was the steel of them, pure of blood, Nahík's. They slew not him nor Muthéllemi, Shareless sharers of the death-due. No blood of Náufali stood to their account, nor Wáhab's, nay, nor Mukházzemi's. Blameless! Clean! Yet have I seen them drive to the ransoming camel herds untouched, unblemished, fresh from the rock-valleys. Succour to the tribe that succoured! Who but shall haste to them in their night of fear, of blackness! All men shall speed to them, Since they gave, since them the avenger gained not to ill-willing, nay, nor suppliant failed of favour. Him they abandoned not. I am weary of life who bear its burdens fourscore and how many years of glory and grief counted. Well may he weary be. I know to-day, the day before it, ay, and the days that were, yet of to-morrow I know nothing. Blind are the eyes of me. I have seen Fate strike out in the darkness, strike like a blind camel: some it touched died straight, some lingered on to decrepitude. I have learned that he who giveth nothing, deaf to his friends' begging, loosed shall be to the world's tooth-strokes: fools' feet shall tread on him; That he that doeth for his name's sake fair deeds shall further it, but he that of men's praise is careless dwindleth in dignity; That he, the lord of wealth, who spendeth naught of his heaped money, him his kinsfolk shall hold lightly: children shall mouth at him; That he who keepeth faith shall find faith; who in simplicity shall pursue the ways accustomed, no tongue shall wag at him; That he who flieth his fate shall meet it, not, though a sky-ladder he should climb, shall his fear fend him: dark death shall noose him down; That he who gifteth the unworthy, spendthrift through idleness, praised shall be to his dispraising, shamed at his fooldoing; That he, who shall refuse the lance-butts borne by the peace-bearers, him the lance-heads shall find fenceless, naked the flesh of him; That he who guardeth not his tent-floor, with the whole might of him, cold shall be his hearth-stone broken, ay, though he smote at none; That he who fleeth his kin shall fare far, foes for his guest-fellows; that he who his own face befouleth none else shall honour him; That he, who casteth not the burdens laid on the back of him, sheer disgrace shall be his portion, waged as he merited; That whatso a man hath by nature, wit-wealth or vanity, hidden deep, the day shall prove it: all shall be manifest. For how many sat wise while silent, yet was their foolishness proved when their too much, too little, slid through their mouth-slitting! The tongue is the strong man's half; the other half is the heart of him: all the rest is a brute semblance, rank corporality. Truly, folly in the old is grievous; no cure is known for it: yet may the young their soul's unwisdom win to new sanity. We asked once, and you gave a guerdon,—twice and again you gave: only the mouth that hath no silence endeth in emptiness. LEBÍD Gone are they the lost camps, light flittings, long sojournings in Miná, in Gháula, Rijám left how desolate. Lost are they. Rayyán lies lorn with its white torrent beds, scored in lines like writings left by the flood-water. Tent-floors smooth, forsaken, bare of all that dwelt in them, years how long, the war-months, months too of peace-pleasures. Spots made sweet with Spring-rains fresh-spilled from the Zodiac, showers from clouds down-shaken, wind-wracks and thunder-clouds; Clouds how wild of night-time, clouds of the dawn darkening, clouds of the red sunset,—all speak the name of her. Here, in green thorn-thickets, does bring forth how fearlessly; here the ostrich-troops come, here too the antelopes. Wild cows, with their wild calf-sucklings, standing over them, while their weanlings wander wide in the bare valleys. Clean-swept lie their hearth-stones, white as a new manuscript writ with texts fresh-graven, penned by the cataracts, Scored with lines and circles, limned with rings and blazonings, as one paints a maid's cheek point-lined in indigo. All amazed I stood there. How should I make questionings? Dumb the rocks around me, silent the precipice, Voices lost, where these dwelt who at dawn abandoning tent and thorn-bush fencing fled to the wilderness. Now thy sad heart acheth, grieveth loud remembering girls how closely howdahed, awned with what canopies. Every howdah curtained, lined with gauze embroideries, figured with festoons hung red from the pole of it. Trooped they there the maid-folk, wild white cows of Túdiha, ay, or does of Wújra, long-necked, their fawns with them, Fled as the miráge flees, fills the vale of Bíshata, fills the tree-cladwádies, íthel and rock-mazes. What of her, Nowára, thy lost love, who fled from thee, every heart-link sundered, close loop and free fetter! Hers the Mórra camp-fires lit how far in Fáïda, in Hejáz what marches! How shalt thou win to her? Eastward move they marching, to Muhájjer wandering camped in Tái, in Férda, ay, in Rukhám of it. Southward on to Yémen, to Sowéyk their sojournings, to Waháf el Káhri, ay, and Tilkhám of it. Man, have done! forget her, one too far to comfort thee! Who would his love garner first let him sunder it. Shed the love that fails thee. Strong be thou, and break with her. Keep thy gifts for friendship, freed from thy wilderment. Mount thee on thy nága. Travel-trained and hard she is, low her back withleanness, lessened the hump of her; Shrunk her sides and wasted, jaded with long journeyings, spare as her hide shoe-straps frayed by her road-faring. Light she to her halter, to thy hand that guideth her, as a red cloud southwards loosed from its rain-burden. Nay a fair wild-ass she; at her side the white-flanked one, he the scarred ass-stallion, bitten and struck for her. Climbed they two the hill-top, he the bite-scarred ass-tyrant her new mood resenting, being in foal to him On the crags high posted watcheth he from Thálabut all the plain to guard her, ambushes laid for her. Six months of Jumáda wandered have they waterless, browsing the moist herbage, he her high sentinel. Till returned their thirsting, need of the far water clefts, all their will to win there speeding them waterwards. What though with heels wounded, still the hot wind driveth them, as a furnace burning, fire-scorched the breath of it. In their trail a dust-cloud, like a smoke it wavereth, like a fire new-lighted, kindling the flame of it, Flame fanned by the North-wind, green wood mixed with dry fuel, smoke aloft high curling. So is the dust of them. He, when her pace slackened, pushed her still in front of him. Nay, she might not falter, tyrant he urged her on, Till they reached the streamlet, plunged and slaked their thirst in it, A spring welling over, crest-high the reeds of it; All its banks a cane-brake, thick with stems o'ershadowing; bent are some, some standing, night-deep the shade of them. Say is this her likeness? Or a wild cow wolf-raided of her sweet calf loitering, she in the van of them. She, the short-nosed, missed it. Lows she now unendingly, roams the rocks, the sand-drifts, mourning and bellowing, Lows in rage beholding that white shape, the limbs of it, dragged by the grey wolf-cubs: who shall their hunger stay? Theirs the chance to seize it, hers the short forgetfulness. Death is no mean archer. Mark how his arrows hit. Stopped she then at night-fall, while the rain in long furrows scored the bush-grown hill-slopes, ceaseless the drip of it, Dripped on her dark back-line, poured abroad abundantly: not a star the heaven showed, cloud-hung the pall of it; One tree all her shelter, standing broad-branched, separate at the sand-hills' edge-line, steep-set the sides of them. She, the white cow, shone there through the dark night luminous, like a pearl of deep-seas, freed from the string of it. Thus till morn, till day-dawn folded back night's canopy; then she fled bewildered, sliding the feet of her, Fled through the rain lakelets, to the pool Suwáyada, all a seven nights' fasting twinned with the days of them, Till despaired she wholly, till her udder milk-stricken shrank, so full to feed him suckling or weaning him. Voices now she hears near, human tones, they startle her, though to her eye naught is: Man! he, the bane of her! Seeketh a safe issue, the forenoon through listening, now in front, behind now, fearing her enemy. And they failed, the archers. Loosed they then to deal with her fine-trained hounds, the lop-eared, slender the sides of them. These outran her lightly. Turned she swift her horns on them, like twin spears of Sámhar, sharp-set the points of them. Well she knew her danger, knew if her fence failed with them hers must be thered death. Hence her wrath's strategy. And she slew Kasábi, foremost hound of all of them, stretched the brach inblood there, ay, and Sukhám of them. Thus is she, my nága. When at noon the plains quiver and the hills dance sun-steeped, cloaked in the heat-tremors, Ride I and my deeds do, nor forbear from wantoning, lest the fools should shame me, blame me the fault-finders. Do not thou misprize me, thou Nowára. One am I binder of all love-knots, ay, and love's sunderer; One who when love fails him, wails not long but flies from it; one whom one alone holds, hard death the hinderer. What dost thou of mirth know, glorious nights, ah, how many: cold nor heat might mar them, spent in good company? Came I thus discoursing to his sign, the wine-seller's, drank at the flag-hoisting, drank till the wine grew dear, Bidding up each full skin: black with age the brand of it, pouring forth the tarred jars, breaking the seals of them; Pure deep draughts of morning, while she played, the sweet singer fingering the lute-strings, showing her skill to me. Ere the cock had crowed once, a first cup was quaffed by me: ere slow man had stretched him, gone was the second cup. On what dawns sharp-winded clothed have I the cold with it, dawns that held the North-wind reined in the hands of them. Well have I my tribe served, brought them aid and armament, slept, my mare's reins round me, night-long their sentinel; Ridden forth at day-dawn, climbed the high-heaped sand-ridges hard by the foe'smarches, dun-red the slopes of them; Watched till the red sun dipped hand-like in obscurity, till the night lay curtained, shrouding our weaknesses; And I came down riding, my mare's neck held loftily as a palm fruit-laden: woe to the gatherer! Swift was she, an ostrich; galloped she how wrathfully, from her sides the sweat streamed, lightening the ribs of her; Strained on her her saddle; dripped with wet the neck of her, the white foam-flakes wreathing, edging the girth of her; Thrusteth her neck forward, shaketh her reins galloping; flieth as the doves fly bound for the water-springs. At the King's Court strangers thronged from what far provinces, each athirst for bounty, fearing indignity. Stiff-necked they as lions in their hate, the pride of them, came with stubborn proud feet, Jinns of the wilderness. Stopped I their vain boastings, took no ill-tongued words from them, let them not take licence. What were their chiefs to me? I it was provided camels for their slaughtering, I who their shares portioned, drawing the lots for them. Every mouth I feasted. Barren mount and milch-camel slew I for all daily. All shared the meat of them. Far guest and near neighbour, every man rose satisfied, full as in Tebála, fed as in green valleys. Ay, the poor my tent filled, thin poor souls like sick-camels, nágas at a tomb tied, bare-backed, no shirt on them. Loud the winter winds howled; piled we high the meat-dishes; flowed the streams of fatness, feeding the fatherless. Thus the tribes were trysted; nor failed we the provident to name one, a wiseman, fair-tongued, as judge for them, One who the spoil portioned, gave to each his just measure, spake to all unfearing, gave or refused to give, A just judge, a tribe-sheykh, wise, fair-worded, bountiful, sweet of face to all men, feared by the warriors. Noble we; our fathers wielded power bequeathed to them, dealt law to the nations, each tribe its lawgiver. All our lineage faultless, no light words our promises; not for us the vain thoughts, passions of common men. Thou fool foe, take warning, whatso the Lord portioneth hold it a gift granted, dealt thee in equity. Loyalty our gift was, faith unstained our heritage; these fair things He gave us, He the distributor. For for us a mansion built He, brave the height of it, lodged therein our old men, ay, and the youths of us, All that bore our burdens, all in our tribe's sore sorrow, all that were our horsemen, all our high councillors. Like the Spring are these men, joy to them that wait on them, to the weak, the widows, towers in adversity. Thus our kin stands faith-firm, purged of tribe-malingerers. Woe be to all false friends! Woe to the envious! ÁNTARA How many singers before me! Are there yet songs unsung? Dost thou, my sad soul, remember where was her dwellingplace? Tents in Jiwá, the fair wádi, speak ye to me of her. Fair house of 'Abla my true love, blessing and joy to thee! Doubting I paused in the pastures, seeking her camel-tracks, high on my swift-trotting nága tall as a citadel, Weaving a dream of the past days, days when she dwelt in them, 'Abla, my true love, in Házzen, Sammán, Mutathéllemi. There on the sand lay the hearth-stones, black in their emptiness, desolate more for the loved ones fled with Om Héythami, Fled to the land of the lions, roarers importunate. Daily my quest of thee darkens, daughter of Mákhrami. Truly at first sight I loved her, I who had slain her kin, ay, by the life ofthy father, not in inconstancy. Love, thou hast taken possession. Deem it not otherwise. Thou in my heart art the first one, first in nobility. How shall I win to her people? Far in Anéyzateyn feed they their flocks in the Spring-time, we in the Gháïlem. Yet it was thou, my beloved, willed we should sunder thus, bridled thyself the swift striders, black night encompassing. Fear in my heart lay a captive, seeing their camel-herds herded as waiting a burden, close to the tents of them, Browsing on berries of khímkhim, forty-two milch-camels, black as the underwing feathers set in the raven's wing. Then was it 'Abla enslaved thee showing her tenderness, white teeth with lips for the kissing: sweet was the taste of them, Sweet as the vials of odours sold by the musk sellers, fragrant the white teeth she showed thee, fragrant the mouth of her. So is a garden new planted fresh in its greenery, watered by soft-falling raindrops, treadless, untenanted. Lo, on it rain-clouds have lighted, soft showers, no hail in them, leaving each furrow a lakelet bright as a silverling. Pattering, plashing they fell there, rains at the sunsetting, wide-spreading runlets of water, streams of fertility, Mixed with the humming of bees' wings droning the day-light long, never a pause in their chaunting, gay drinking-choruses. Blithe iteration of bees' wings, wings struck in harmony, sharply as steel on the flint-stone, light-handed smithy strokes. Sweet, thou shalt rest till the morning all the night lightly there, while I my red horse bestriding ride with the forayers. Resting-place more than the saddle none have I, none than he war-horse of might in the rib-bones: deep is the girth of him. Say, shall a swift Shadaníeh bear me to her I love, one under ban for the drinker, weaned of the foal of her, One with the tail carried archwise, long though the march hath been, one with the firm foot atrample, threading the labyrinths? Lo, how she spurneth the sand-dunes, like to the ear-less one, him with the feet set together: round him young ostriches Troop like the cohorts of Yémen, herded by 'Ajemis, she-camel cohorts of Yémen, herded by stammerers. Watching a beacon they follow, led by the crown of him carried aloft as a howdah, howdah where damsels sit, Him the small-headed, returning, fur-furnished Ethiop, black slave, to Thu-el-Ashíra: there lie his eggs in it. Lo, how my nága hath drunken deeply in Dóhradeyn; how hath she shrunk back in Déylam, pools of the enemy, Shrunk from its perilous cisterns, scared by the hunting one, great-headed shrieker of evening, clutched to the flank of her. Still to her off-side she shrinketh, deemeth the led-cat there Clawing the more that she turneth;—thus is her fear of them. Lo, she hath knelt in Ridá-a, pleased there and murmuring soft as the sweet-fluting rushes crushed by the weight of her. Thickly as pitch from the boiling oozeth the sweat of her, pitch from the cauldron new-lighted, fire at the sides of it, Oozeth in drops from the ear-roots. Wrathful and bold is she, proud in her gait as a stallion hearing the battle-cry. Though thou thy fair face concealest still in thy veil from me, yet am I he that hath captured horse-riders how many! Give me the praise of my fair deeds. Lady, thou knowest it, kindly am I and forbearing, save when wrong presseth me. Only when evil assaileth, deal I with bitterness; then am I cruel in vengeance, bitter as colocynth. Sometime in wine was my solace. Good wine, I drank of it, suaging the heat ofthe evening, paying in white money, Quaffing in goblets of saffron, pale-streaked with ivory, hard at my hand their companion, the flask to the left of me. Truly thus bibbing I squandered half my inheritance; yet was my honour a wideword. No man had wounded it. Since that when sober my dew-fall rained no less generous: thou too, who knowest my nature, thou too be bountiful! How many loved of the fair ones have I not buffeted, youths overthrown! Ha, the blood-streams shrill from the veins of them. Swift-stroke two-handed I smote him, thrust through the ribs of him; forth flowed the stream of his life-blood red as anemone. Ask of the horsemen of Málek, O thou his progeny, all they have seen of my high deeds. Then shalt thou learn of them How that I singly among them, clad in war's panoply, stout on my war-horse theswift one charged at their chivalry. Lo, how he rusheth, the fierce one, singly in midst of them, waiting anon for the archers closing in front of us. They that were nearest in battle, they be my proof to thee how they have quailed at my war-cry, felt my urbanity. Many and proud are their heroes, fear-striking warriors, men who nor flee nor surrender, yielding not easily. Yet hath my right arm o'erborne them, thrust them aside from me, laid in their proud backs the long spear: slender the shaft of it. See, how it splitteth asunder mail-coat and armouring; not the most valiant arefuge hath from the point of it. Slain on the ground have I left him, prey to the lion's brood, feast of the wrists and the fingers. Ha, for the sacrifice! Heavy his mail-coat, its sutures, lo, I divided them piercing the joints of the champion; brave was the badge of him. Quick-handed he with the arrows, cast in the winter-time, raider of wine-sellers' sign-boards, blamed as a prodigal. He, when he saw me down riding, making my point at him, showed me his white teeth in terror, nay, but not smilingly. All the day long did we joust it. Then were his finger tips stained as though dipped in the íthlem, dyed with the dragon's blood, Till with a spear-thrust I pierced him, once and again with it, last, with a blade of the Indies, fine steel its tempering, Smote him, the hero of stature, tall as a tamarisk, kinglike, in sandals of dun hide, noblest of all of them. Oh, thou, my lamb, the forbidden! prize of competitors, why did they bid me not love thee? why art thou veiled from me? Sent I my hand-maiden spy-like: Go thou, I said to her, bring me the news of my true love, news in veracity. Go. And she went, and returning: These in unguardedness sit, and thy fair lambamong them, waiting thy archery. Then was it turned she towards me, fawn-necked in gentleness, noble in bearing, gazelle-like, milk-white the lip of it. Woe for the baseness of 'Amru, lord of ingratitude! Verily thanklessness turneth souls from humanity. Close have I kept to the war-words thy father once spoke to me, how I should deal in the death-play, when lips part and teeth glitter, When in the thick of the combat heroes unflinchingly cry in men's ears their defiance, danger forgot by them. Close have I kept them and stood forth their shield from the enemy, calling onall with my war-cries, circling and challenging. There where the horsemen rode strongest I rode out in front of them, hurled forth my war-shout and charged them; no man thought blame of me. Antar! they cried; and their lances, well-cords in slenderness, pressed to the breast of my war-horse still as I pressed on them. Doggedly strove we and rode we. Ha, the brave stallion! now is his breast dyed with blood-drops, his star-front with fear of them! Swerved he, as pierced by the spear-points. Then in his beautiful eyes stood the tears of appealing, words inarticulate. If he had learned our man's language, then had he called to me: if he had known our tongue's secret, then had he cried to me. Thus to my soul came consoling; grief passed away from it hearing the heroes applauding, shouting: Ho, Antar, ho! Deep through the sand-drifts the horsemen charged with teeth grimly set, urging their war-steeds, the strong-limbed, weight bearers all of them. Swift the delúls too I urged them, spurred by my eagerness forward to high deeds of daring, deeds of audacity. Only I feared lest untimely drear death should shorten me ere on the dark sons of Démdem vengeance was filled for me. These are the men that reviled me, struck though I struck them not, vowed me to bloodshed and evil or ere I troubled them. Nay, let their hatred o'erbear me! I care not. The sire of them slain lies for wild beasts and vultures. Ha! for the sacrifice! IBN KOLTHÚM Ha! The bowl! Fill it high, a fair morning wine-cup! Leave we naught of the lees of Andarína. Rise, pour forth, be it mixed, let it foam like saffron! tempered thus will we drink it, ay, free-handed. Him who grieves shall it cure, his despites forgotten; nay, but taste it in tears, it shall console thee. He, the hoarder of wealth, with the hard face fear-lined, whilst he tasteth, behold him freely giving. Thou, O mother of Amru, the cup deniest; yet, the right is the wine should pass thy right-hand. Not the worst of thy three friends is he thou scornest, he for whom thou hast poured no draught of morning. O the cups that I quaffed in Baálabékki! O the bowls of Damascus, Kaisarína! Sad fate stands at the door, and uninvited takes us marked for his own at the hour predestined. Hold, draw rein, ere we sunder, sweet camel-rider; list awhile to my words, nor idly answer. Wait. Of thee would I know how came the estrangement, whence this haste to betray a friend too faithful? Tell the fear of that day, what blows! what woundings! what refreshment I poured on thy kin's eyelids! Each to-day is foredoomed. And who knows to-morrow, who the after of days, the years we see not? She her beauty shall show thee, if thou shouldst find her far from injurious eyes, in desert places. Fair white arms shall she show, as a white she-camel's, pure as hers the long-necked one, yet unmounted. Twin breasts smooth, shalt thou see, as of ivory polished, guarded close from the eyes, the hands of lovers. Waist how supple, how slim! Thou shalt span it sweetly; fair flanks sloped to thine eyes and downward bending. Broad her hips for desire, than thy tent door wider; nay, but thine is her waist, thine own for madness. Ankles twain, as of marble, are hers. I hear them clanking, clattering on, as her anklets rattle. None hath grieved as I grieve, not she, Om Sákbin, roaring loud for her lost one, her colt-camel. None hath grieved as I grieve, not she, the mother mourning nine of her sons, her home their red grave. So recalled I youth's time, and aloud with longing wept at thought of her gone, her howdah fleeting, Till before me the plain of Yemáma spreading flashed, its points in the sun like a foe unsheathing. O thou Lord Ibn Hind, be thy wrath less quick-breathed; wait the word of our mouth, the whole truth spoken, How each day we ride forth, our banners pure-white, how each night we return, our banners red-dyed. Days of fighting had we, and of joyous glory, whilst we smote at the king, his dues denying, Whilst we vanquished the man their tribes had named king, him, the chief they had crowned, their world's protector. Stood our horses before him asweat with combat, wreathed the reins on their necks, their hind-feet resting. Near him built we our tents, Dhu-tulúh our outpost, El Shamáat at our hand, his riders routed. Fled the dogs of their tribes from our spear-points howling; lo, their thorn we have cut from root to branches. They who came to our wheat-mill have known our mill-stones; they who came for our corn have been stayed for grinding. Let the mill-cloth be spread in the East lands Nejd-wards; be our corn the Kodáat, their tribes assembled. You as guests to our door in your guile came smiling; see, the high feast is served, yourselves the banquet. Fairly entertained we and plied with victual; just at dawn it began, our mill-stone grinding. We the tribes have supplied, have up-held their charges, borne the burden alone they laid upon us. Pierced have we with our spear-points their backs the fleers, smitten low with our swords and pruned their proud ones. Lances black of the Khótti are ours, how slender, swords that hiss in our hands, to impale and pare them. Yea, the heads of their mighty have rolled before us, loads let loose on a road from beasts unburdened. Still with might we assailed, we pushed, we pressed them, lopped their heads at the neck, laid bare their shoulders. Hate for hate have we given, in deeds revealing all the strength of our wrong, our long-pent anger. Heirs are we of our wrath, as Maád well knoweth; glory deal we and wounds, as our right proveth. When surprise is our lot and the tent-roofs tumble, —sudden raid of the foe—we defend our neighbours. Bite we sharp with our swords, nor apportion mercy, swift ere these shall have seen the hand that smites them. Reckless we in the mêlée, our swords with their swords; wooden swords you had deemed theirs in hands of children; Deemed our garments and theirs, their robes and our robes, dyed had been in the vats—so red a purple! Men there were in their fear held back and faltered; terror clutched at their lips, their fate before them. We alone, like Mount Ráhwa unmoved, in squadrons stood protecting the weak, their battle-winners. All we held in our youth to be slain for glory, ay, and our gray-beard fighters, our old campaigners, Doughty challengers we of them, all ill-comers, Girt for crossing of swords, their sons with our sons, This day going in fear of our children's fair lives, faring forth in a band and as swift dispersing; That day freed and secure, the alarm forgotten, raiding we in our turn on a far-off foray. Ours the Captain of Júshm, our chief Ibn Béker, Breaker he of the tribes, of the weak, the strong tribes. Not again shall they tell it, the envious nations, how we humbled our heads awhile before them. Not again shall they fool us or jest against us; lo, the cheek of the proud with pride we out-cheek. Tell us, Prince Ibn Hind, on what guile thou buildest? how should we to thy kingship yield obedience? Tell us, 'Amru the King, by what subtle reason dreamest thou to cajole our slandered homage? Words—nay, threats—thou hast hurled. But O 'Amru, softly! these were well for thy slaves, thy mother's bondsmen. Think! Our lances, how oft have other foemen failed, before thee, to bend them, to make them pliant. So the lance-head of iron which bites the lance-shaft, twists to grip of the hand and makes a weapon; Stiff it grows in the grasp, till aloft it jangles, rives the head of the foe and his who forged it. Who has dared thee to tell of Júshm Ibn Béker, him as wanting in war, our proud forefather? Are not we too of 'Alkama, heirs in glory, his, the fortress of fame? To-day we hold it. Come not we of Muhálhil? Nay, more and better, come not we of Zohéyr, of the nobles noblest. Ours Attáb and Kolthúm, in ascent our fathers; we the heirs of their fame, our first possession. We with Búrati too, as all wot, claim kinship, him, the shield of the weak, as we too shield them. All are ours, and Koléyb the renowned great fighter. Whatso is in the world of fame is our fame. Who dares link our she-camel with his, lo, straightway broken lieth the neck-rope, the neck too broken. Firm are we in our faith. Thou shalt find none surer, no such men of their word to bind and loosen. We, the day of the beacons on high Khazára, gave, and more, of our aid than all the aiders. We the strong-hold of Thú-urát held how stoutly, starved our nágas within it on what lean pasture! We the right wing defended, the day of battle; next us fought too the left wing, no less our brethren. Whoso stood in their path have beheld them charging; whoso paused on our way we slew before us. These returned with the plunder, with wealth made captive, we with lords in our train and kings in fetters. Ho, ye children of Béker, aroint ye, boasters! Know ye nought of our name? Must ye learn our glory? Nay, ye know of our valour, our hands with your hands, fights how fierce with the spears, with the arrows singing. Helmets ours are of steel, stout shields from Yémen, tall the swords in our hands and poised for striking. Mail-coats ours; in the sun you have seen them gleaming; hauberks wide for our swords, of a noble wideness. Ay, and after the fight, you have seen us naked, creased the skin of our limbs like leathern jerkins, Seen the bend of our backs, where the armour pressed us, scored with waves, like a pool the South-wind blowing. Lo, the mares we bestride at the dawn of battle! sleek-coat mares, the choice ones; ourselves have weaned them. Charge they mail-clad together, how red with battle, red the knots of their reins as dyed with blood-stains. Are not these the inheritance of our fathers? shall not we to our sons in turn bequeath them? We the vanguard in arms? Behind us marching trail our beautiful ones, our wives close-guarded. They it was who imposed on our lives a promise, still their badge to uphold from all assaulting, Ay, and plunder to bring, fair mares and helmets, noble prisoners, bound with ropes, to serve them. Thus go we to the war. And behold, the clansmen seized with fear of us fly and form alliance, While our maidens advance with a proud gait swaying, like to drinkers of wine, with spoils o'erladen, Camel-riders each one, of Júshm Ibn Béker, beauty theirs and the blood, and all noble virtues, Feeders sure of our mares. Yet they tell us lightly: none will we for our lovers, save the valiant. Since the fence of the fair is but this, the sword-stroke, this, the shredding of limbs as a plaything shredded. Thus say they, and we hear them, our swords unsheathing yet are all men our sons who kneel before us. Heads we toss of the proud, as you see a ball tossed, kicked in play by the youths that urge the football. All men know us of old in Maád, the tribesmen, when our tents we have built in the open pastures, Feasters are we of men with the men that love us, slayers are we of men, the men that hate us; Rightful lords of the plain, to forgive and welcome; where we will we have pitched. Who has dared gainsay us? Still with ire we deny in the face of anger; still with smiles we accede to smiles of pleading. Faithful aye to the weak who have made submission; ruthless aye to the proud who raise rebellion. Ours the right of the wells, of the springs untroubled; theirs the dregs of the plain, the rain-pools trampled. Nay, but ask of the tribes, of Tommáh, Domíyan, what the worth of our hands, of our hearts in battle. Nay, but ask of the King, when he came to bend us, what of pride we returned to his words of evil. Lo, the lands we o'errun, till the plains grow narrow, lo, the seas will we sack with our war-galleys. Not a weanling of ours but shall win to manhood, find the world at his knees, its great ones kneeling. EL HÁRITH Lightly took she her leave of me, Asmá-u, went no whit as a guest who outstays a welcome; Went forgetting our trysts, Burkát Shemmá-u, all the joys of our love, our love's home, Khalsá-u. Muhayyátu, she thee forgets, Sifáhu, thee, Fitákon, Aádibon, thee Wafá-u. Thee, Riád el Katá, thee, vale of Shérbub, 'Anak, thee, Shobatána, and thee, Ablá-u. Nay, ye lost are to me with my lost glory; nay, though tears be my meat, weeping wins no woman. Yet, a snare to my eyes, afar was kindled fire by night on the hill. It was Hind's love-beacon. Blindly now do I watch her from Khezáza; woe, the warmth of it, woe,—though the hilltops redden! Woe its blaze from Akík, its flame from Shákhseyn! woe the signal alight for me, Hind's love-incense! Out on tears and despair! I go free, sundered; here stand doors of relief. Who hath fled escapeth. Mount I light on my nága. No hen ostrich swift as she, the tall trotter, her brood behind her, Hearing voices who fled from them, the hunters, pressing fast on her way from mid-eve to nightfall. Nay, behold her, my noble one, upheaving motes and dust on her path, as a cloud pursuing. All un-shooed are the feet of her, her sandals strewn how wide on her road by the rough rocks loosened. Joy thus take I on her, the summer heat through. All but I had despaired,—like a blinded camel. O the curse of men's eyes, of their ill-speaking! Danger deep and a wound did their false lips deal us. Have not these with their tongues made small things great things, telling lies of our lives, our kind kin, the Arákim? Mixing blame with un-blame for us, till flouted stand we, proven of wrong, with the guilty guiltless. All, say these, that have run with us the wild ass, ours are they, our allies, as our own tribe their tribes. Thus by night did they argue it and plot it, rose at dawn to their treason and stood forth shouting. Loud the noise of their wrath. This called, that answered; great the neighings of steeds and the camel roarings. Ho, thou weaver of wild words, thou tale-painter! must it thus be for ever and thus with Amru? Not that slanders are strange. Their words we heed not; long ere this have we known them, their lips, the liars. High above them we live. Hate may not harm us, fenced in towers of renown, our unstained bright honour. Long hath anger assailed us, rage, denial; long hath evil prevailed in the eyes of evil. Nathless, let them assault. As well may Fortune hurl its spears at the rocks, at the cloud-robed mountains. Frowneth wide of it Fear. Fate shall not shake it. Time's worst hand of distress shall disturb it never. O thou king Iramíyan! With thee circle riders keen of their steel to cut off thy foemen. King art thou, the all-just, of Earth's high walkers foremost, first in the World, its all-praise surpassing. If of wrong there be aught untamed, unstraightened, bring but word to our chiefs; they shall deal out justice Set thy gaze on the hills, on Mílha, Sákib. See the slain unavenged, while alive their slayers. Probe the wounds of our anger, though thou hurt us, yet shall truth be approved and the falsehood flouted. Else be thou of us silent, and we silent, closing lids on our wrong, though the mote lies under. Yet, refusing the peace, whomso you question, he shall speak in our praise, shall assign us worship. O the days of the war, of our free fighting, raidings made in surprise, the retreats, the shoutings! How our nágas we scourged from Sâf el Bahreyn, pressing hard to the end, to our goal El Hása! Turned had we on Temím before Mohárrem, taken their daughters for wives, their maids for handmaids. None might stay us nor strive with us. The stoutest turned, though turning availed not nor their feet flying, Nay, nor mountain might hide nor plain protect them; blackness burnt in the sun, it might bring no succour. Thou, O King, art the master. Where in all lands standeth one of thy height? There is none beside thee. Lo, how stiff was our stand for him, El Móndir. Say, were we, as were these, Ibn Hind's base herdsmen? Let the Tághlebi slain in their blood answer, unavenged where they lie. In the dust we spilled it. He, the king, when in that high place Maisúna's tent he builded for her who so loved Ausá-u, What of turbulent folk did he there gather, broken men of the tribes, ragged, hungry vultures! Dates and water to all he gave in bounty. God's revenge on the guilty they called his soldiers. You the weight of them proved with your mad challenge, brought them blind on your back by your idle boasting. Nay, they gave you no false words, laid no ambush; broad before you at noon you beheld them marching. Ho, thou bearer of tales to Amru, babbler! when of this shall the end be, how soon the silence? Proofs he hath at our hands, three honest tokens, each enough for his eyes of our faìth unswerving. First when came from Shakík at him the war-lords, all Maád in their tribes, with each clan a banner. Mail-clad men were there there, their chieftain Káis, he, the Prince Karathíyan, a rock, a stronghold. With him sons of the brave, of freeborn ladies; naught might stand to their shock save alone our swordblades. Them we drove back with wounds like the out-rushing streams when goat-skins are pricked; it was thus their blood flowed; Drove them back to Thahlána its strong places, scattered, drenched in their gore where the thigh wounds spouted. Struck we stern at the lives of them; then trembled deep our spears in their well, like a long-roped bucket. Only God shall appraise how we misused them; none hath claimed for their lives the uncounted blood price. Next with Hójra it was, Ibn om Katáma; with him rode the Iráni: how red their armour! Roused, a lion, he chargeth, his feet thudding, yet as Spring to the poor in their day of hunger. Chains we struck from the hands of Imr el Káis; long the days of his grief were, his months of bondage. We, when Jaun of Aál Beni 'Aus sought us, rock-strong with him a band of unyielding horsemen, Nothing feared, though the dust of them around us swept the plain like a smoke by the war-flame kindled. Put we swords on his neck, Ghassán, for Móndir, wrath that less than our right was the blood price counted. Lastly brought we the nine of the blood royal, all their wealth in our hands, an unnumbered booty. Amr a son was of ours Ibn Om Eyyási; close in kinship he came, when he gave the dowry. Let this stand to our count, our power in pleading! land with land are we knit, by the strong ones strengthened. Hold the tongue of your boasting, your vainglory, else be yourselves the blind, on yourselves ill-fortune. O, remember the oath of Thil Majázi, all that was of old time, the fair words, the pledges. Flee the evil, the hate! Shall men gainsay it, that which stands on the skin, for the whim of any? Think how we with yourselves the fair deed signed there, did the thing we should do, and no less, our duty. Faction all and injustice! As well, when feasting, take, for vow of a sheep, a gazelle in payment! Was it ours, say, the blame of it all, when Kíndah took your booths for a spoil, that of us you claim it? Was it ours that foul deed of him, Eyádi? are we bound with his rope, like a loaded camel? Not by us were these done to their death, nor Káis, nay, nor Jéndal by us, nor he Haddá-u. Theirs, not ours, were the crimes of Beni Atíkeh; clean of blame are our hands since you tore the treaties. Eighty went of Temím: in their right hands lances; each a sentence of death, when they went against you, Left your sons where they lay sword-slashed and blood-stained, brought a tumult of spoil till men's ears were deafened. Is it ours the ill-deed of the man Hanífa? ours the strife of all time, Earth's arrears of evil? Ours the wrong of Kodáat? Nay, 'tis all injustice; not for these and their sins are our hands indicted. Not for these, nor their raid on the Béni Rázah; who shall approve their claim in Nitá, in Búrka? Long they cringed for a spoil, these camel-cravers, yet not one did we give, not a black nor white one; Left them bare till they fled with their backs broken, all unwatered their thirst, unassuaged their vengeance; Horsemen hard on their track, El Fellak's riders, pity none in their hand, in their heart no sparing. Ours it was, the dominion of all these peoples, ours till El Móndir ruled, the sweet rain of heaven. Thou, O King, art the master. Thou our witness stoodst the day of Hayáreyn. Our proof is proven! THE STEALING OF THE MARE AN ARABIAN EPIC OF THE TENTH CENTURY I In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate! He who narrateth this tale is Abu Obeyd, and he saith: When I took note and perceived that the souls of men were in pleasure to hear good stories, and that their ears were comforted and that they made good cheer in the listening, then called I to mind the tale of the Agheyli Jaber and his mare, and of all that befell him and his people. For this is a story of wonderful adventure and marvellous stratagems, and a tale which when one heareth he desireth to have it evermore in remembrance as a delight tasted once by him and not forgotten. And the telling of it is this: The Emir Abu Zeyd the Helali Salameh was sitting one morning in his tent with the Arabs of the Beni Helal and the Lords of the tribe. And lo, there appeared before them in the desert the figure of one wandering to and fro alone. And this was Ghanimeh. And the Emir Abu Zeyd said to his slave Abul Komsan, “Go forth thou, and read me the errand of this fair Lady and bring me word again.” And Abul Komsan went forth as he was bidden, and presently returned to them with a smiling countenance, and he said, “O my Lord, there is the best of news for thee, for this is one that hath come a guest to thee, and she desireth something of thee, for fate hath oppressed her and troubles sore are on her head. And she hath told me all her story and the reason of her coming, and that it is from her great sorrow of mind; for she had once an husband, and his name was Dagher abul Jud, a great one of the Arabs. And to them was born a son named Amer ibn el Keram, and the boy's uncle's name was En Naaman. And when the father died, then the uncle possessed himself of all the inheritance, and he drove forth the widow from the tribe; and he hath kept the boy as a herder of his camels; and this for seven years. And Ghanimeh all that time was in longing for her son. But at the end of the seventh year she returned to seek the boy. Then Naaman struck her and drove her forth. And Amer, too, the boy, his nephew, is in trouble, for Naaman will not now yield to the boy that he should marry his daughter, though she was promised to him, and he hath betrothed her to another. And when Amer begged him for the girl (for the great ones of the tribe pitied the boy, and there had interceded for him fifty-and-five of the princes), he answered, ‘Nay, that may not be, not though in denying it I should taste of the cup of evil things. But, if he be truly desirous of the girl and would share all things with me in my good fortune, then let him bring me the mare of the Agheyli Jaber,—and the warriors be witness of my word thereto.’ But when the men of the tribe heard this talk, they said to one another: ‘There is none able to do this thing but only Abu Zeyd.’ And thus hath this lady come to thee. And I entreat thee, my lord, look into her business and do for her what is needful.” And when Abu Zeyd heard this word of his slave Abul Komsan he rejoiced exceedingly, and his heart waxed big within him, and he threw his cloak as a gift to Abul Komsan, and he bade him go to the Lady Ghanimeh and treat her with all honour, for, “I needs,” said he, “must see to her affairs and quiet her mind.” So Abul Komsan returned to her, and he built for her a tent, and did all that was needed. And Abu Zeyd bade him attend upon her and bring her dresses of honour and all things meet for her service. Then began the Narrator to sing: Saith the hero Abu Zeyd the Helali Salameh: (Woe is me, my heart is a fire, a fire that burneth!) On a Friday morning once, I sat with three companions, I in my tent, the fourth of four, with the sons of Amer. Sudden I raised my eyes and gazed at the breadth of the desert, Searching the void afar, the empty hills and the valleys; Lo, in the midmost waste a form, where the rainways sundered, Wandering uncertain round in doubt, with steps of a stranger. Turned I to Abul Komsan, my slave, and straightway I bade him, “Ho, thou master of signs, expound to us this new comer.” Abul Komsan arose and went, and anon returning, “Fortune fair,” said he, “I bring and a noble token. O my Lord Abu Zeyd,” he cried, and his lips were smiling, “Here is a guest of renown for thee, a stranger, a lady, One for the wounding of hearts, a dame of illustrious lineage, One whose heart is on fire with grief, and sorely afflicted.” The dark one threw off his cloak to Abul Komsan in guerdon, Even I, Abu Zeyd Salameh, the while my companions Rose with me all as I rose in my place, we four rejoicing, Hassan and Abu Kheyl Diab, and the Kadi Faïd. And first of them Hassan spake and said, “Is my name not Hassan? Sultan and chief and lord am I of the lords of the Bedu. Shall not my tent stand free to all, to each guest that cometh? So God send her to me, be they hers, two thousand camels.” And Abu Kheyl uprose, and with him the Kadi Faïd. “And I,” said he, “no less will give to this dame two thousand.” Nor was the Kadi slow to speak: “Though this pen and paper All my poor fortune be,” said he, “I will name her thirty.” But I, Salameh, said, “By my faith, these gifts were little; Mine be a larger vow.” And I swore an oath and I promised All that she would to bring, nay, all her soul demanded, Even a service of fear, a thing from the land of danger. And thus they sat in discourse till the hour of noon was upon them, And the caller called to prayer, and the great ones prayed assembled; And these too in their place, and they stood in prayer together. And when they had made an end of praises and prostrations, Back to the tent came they, and still behold the lady Wandering in doubt uncertain there with steps of a stranger. Then to the desert went I forth, and I called and I shouted, “Marhaba, welcome to thee,” I cried, “thou illustrious lady, Welcomes as many be to thee as the leagues thou hast wandered.” And she, “I seek the hero, the Knight of Helal ibn Amer, Bring me to him, the renowned of might, the hero of Amer.” And I, “I hear and obey, though I am not of the great ones. Raise thy eyes and behold him here, the Sultan Hassan, And with him Abu Musa Diab, the light of Zoghbat, Best of the swordsmen he, and our learned Kadi Faïd, The reader of the word, the learnedest of the learned, And with them Aziz ed Din and El Hajin and Amer, Fifty and five of the best, Fulano and Fulano. These be men of their word; asking thou shalt obtain it: Ask thou all that thou wilt, even all thy soul desireth.” But she, “Nay, thou dost mock, thou slave and idle talker, Not of these would I hear nor of other than Salameh, Salameh Abu Zeyd, Chief of Helal ibn Amer. Why art thou mute of him for whom my soul is kindled?” And I, “Myself am he, the Helali Salameh, Welcome to thee, and welcome as wide as thou hast wandered.” And she prayed, “O Abu Zeyd, behold me here thy stranger. A boon I ask, O dark one, a mighty deed of daring. Thy suppliant am I, thou son of Risk Salameh, From the distress of time behold my tears are flowing. For this one boon behold me pleading here before thee. I have tasted Fortune's change. I plead by the day of judgment.” And I, “What is thy want, O Lady, that I grant it? All, to the cord, I give, so thy tears cease from flowing.” And she, “O man admired! A great one was my husband, A knight, a prince of lineage, Abul Jud Dagher, A man of mighty wealth, stored up in many houses, Wealth whose sole catalogue were a library of volumes. He dying left behind with me our one son Amer, To me and to the hate of an ill-minded uncle. For when that Abul Jud was gathered to his fathers, And sent from his loved home to death's unjoyful dwellings, Behold this Naaman, this man he called his brother, In arms against our house, he with his evil-doers, Raiding all our wealth and making Amer captive. Thus weeping did I flee, and seven long years an exile Bore I his heart with me like a bird ever flying. And then, the seven years done, to the dear place forbidden Turned I in my love and my sweet son's remembrance. And when he saw me near he called to me, ‘O mother, Behold me in what straits I lie through men of evil (And these may God requite!). Seven years behold me outcast, Herding the flocks afar each day in the lone desert, And in my uncle's tent nightly a guest unwelcome. Yet was there one with me, his daughter fair, Betina, Whom I, as of little count, might wander with unquestioned Until but few days since. But now another suitor Asking her hand hath come, and with him brave companions. And for this suitor's sake am I forbid her presence. And what then, O my mother, shall I do, my mother, Who have neither riches, though my soul is generous, Nor wile nor stratagem in my life's little wisdom? How shall I win to her, this fair child of my uncle? How shall I answer her, her greetings night and morning? Thus spake he, and I heard, and with a heart of anger Went I forth with him my son, and to the tribesmen Pleaded in every tent his cause, we two as suppliants, Calling on all their chiefs to give the hand of succour. And fifty and five of them were those who lent agreement, This one and that with joy, Fulano and Fulano. And with them Selman was, Abul Jud el Aser. And Jafferi was there, Khalifa ibn Nasser, And many more of note. And they rose and went assembled To the council of the king, and found him there in judgment Set with his valiant men, and meting out obedience. And when En Naaman saw them he cried to them in welcome: ‘Sit ye, O chiefs, with me,’ and made their place beside him, And when he found them mute and of their manner bashful, ‘Ye have come,’ said he, ‘to speak of him, my brother's orphan.’ And they, ‘Ay, of a truth. We ask for him Betina.’ And he, ‘Be short of words. From me ye shall get no lying. Nasser hath come for her, and with him a brave dowry. This one, what hath he (speak) beside his beggar's portion?’ And they, ‘But we will give. So be thy mind unburdened, And his, too, of the doubt. We stand to thee his guarants.’ And Selman spake, ‘Behold it, to the last coin, his dowry.’ And Jafferi, ‘Nor less, things needed for the wedding. All that thou wilt we bring, a gift to thee and Amer.’ Then answered them the hero, En Naaman, the chieftain: ‘List to my word, O chiefs, O generous-minded princes. Let him but bring one thing, the thing my soul desireth, So shall I stand content, nor ask a further dowry, Necklace, nor chain, nor ring, nor ornament of silver, Nor silk, nor broidered robe, and, lo, my word is on it. He shall be to me a son, and I will love him truly, More than a brother's son, in all things first and foremost. But come he empty-handed, the girl shall be another's.’ And so with a pious phrase the hero left them wondering. And straightway questioned all, ‘And what is this, O Naaman?’ Laughing he made reply, ‘The mare of Agheyli Jaber.’ Then on the chiefs assembled there fell as it were a tremor, And each man looked at each, nor made they further pleading, Only with whispered looks the thought passed round in silence, ‘This thing can no man bring, nor he were a Jinn in cunning, Not though on wings he flew.’ But Amer in his longing, Swore he the deed would do for sake of her, Betina. And when I learned it all, how it had fared in council, From my poor head the wits, O Sheykh Salameh, wandered. And since that day of trouble (listen, O Helali!) Around the world of men have I in anguish wandered, Seeking of kings and chiefs and princes of the Arabs Which one shall help our case, and all in turn have answered, ‘This is a deed of deeds meet only for Salameh. There is but one thy help, he of Helal ibn Amer.’ Thus have I come to thee on my soul's faith, Salameh, Thee the champion proved of all whose hearts are doubting, Thee the doer of right, the scourge of the oppressor, Thee the breeze in autumn, thee the winter's coolness, Thee the morning's warmth after a night of watching, Thee the wanderer's joy, well of the living water, Thee to thy foeman's lips as colocynth of the desert, Thee the river Nile, in the full day of his flooding, When he hath mounted high and covereth the islands. Behold me thus for thee clothed in the robes of amber. Beyond thee there is none save the sole Lord of pity. Thou art my last appeal, O Helali Salameh, Glory of the Arabs, beauty of all beholders.” Thus then spoke Ghanimeh, and Abu Zeyd made answer, “Nay, but a thousand welcomes, O thou mother of Amer, Welcomes as many be as the leagues thy feet have wandered. Fear thou nought at our hand, nay, only but fair dealing.” And the hero Abu Zeyd called to his servant loudly: “Forth, O Abul Komsan, nor let thy footsteps linger.” And the slave said, “Yes and yes, O thou beloved of the Arabs.” And he, “Go with this lady and build her a pavilion, With breadths of perfumed silk, and bid prepare all dainties That she may eat of the best, and serve her in due honour. For well it is in life to be of all things generous, Ere we are called away to death's unjoyful dwellings, Even of the shoulder meat, that the guests may rise up praising.” And Abul Komsan went and all things set in order, Even as he was bid, at the word of his lord Salameh. Said the Narrator: And, when the lady had made an end of talking, then agreed the Emir Abu Zeyd to all her desires, and he delivered her into the hand of Abul Komsan, and bade him to do her honour and to serve her in his own person, and not through the persons of others, and he gave him his commands, saying: “Take charge of her thus and thus, the while I go forth and see diligently to her affairs.” And Abul Komsan did as he was commanded. And immediately the Emir Abu Zeyd arose and went into his own tent and took out a herdsman's wallet and a lute, and went forth in disguise as a singer, of the singers of ballads. And thus travestied he came to the Assembly that he might take his leave of the Sultan Hassan and of the rest. And Hassan said to him, “O Mukheymer, whither goest thou, and what is thy design?” And Abu Zeyd made answer, “I am of a mind to journey abroad, even to the land of the Agheyli Jaber.” And so he disclosed to him all his plan, both what was without and what was within, the manifest and the hidden. And as he spoke behold the Sultan's countenance changed, and he grew pale, and “Goest thou,” said he, “to the land of our enemy, and takest thou from us the light of thy countenance? Leave now this adventure, and we will determine all things as is best for the fair lady.” But Abu Zeyd said: “Nay, for the like of me that were a disgrace and a shame, and need is that I go: ay, though I were given to drink of the cup of confusion, yet must I go forward.” And Diab said, “May no such disgrace befall thee, nor confusion, for this would be to us all a sign that thou lackedst understanding.” And Abu Zeyd said, “Lengthen not thy words.” And the Kadi calling to the others, said, “My mind is that you should prevent him, even if it were by force, from his purpose, nor let him go.” But when Abu Zeyd heard that word of the Kadi his wrath flamed forth, and he said, “How! would ye deal with me in this wise, with me, the Emir Abu Zeyd?” Now the ears of the tribe were filled with these sayings, and their mouths with the noise of them. But none was able to turn Abu Zeyd from his way. And his sister Rih came to dissuade him. Yet he listened not to her words, but soothed and consoled her only, and bade her farewell. And he departed on his quest, going by the desolate valleys of the desert. Then once more the Narrator singeth: Saith the hero, Abu Zeyd Salameh Mukheymer: “Needs must I haste abroad to the wide breadths of desert, What though I fare afar to death's unjoyful dwellings? Constrained of my guest I go to do her pleasure's bidding.” And speaking thus he turned and went to his pavilion, And clothed himself anew in his most cheerful raiment, Lengthening his kaftan's sleeves and rolling broad his turban, Till in disguise he stood, a singer of the singers, With wallet in his hand and lute for his sole armour, But in his head what store of strategy and cunning! And thus to the Divan, wherein the chiefs assembled Crowded all the floor as it were the market of Amer. And when the Sultan Hassan beheld him at the tent ropes, Loudly he cried to him, “Thou goest forth? And whither? Tell us, O Abu Zeyd, what meaneth this thy venture?” And I, Salameh, said, “It is a thing of honour. A lady came to me, O Hassan, one a stranger, To ask a deed of me, and my own tongue hath bound me. For when I cried to her, ‘What is thy need, O lady?’ She answered, ‘This I need, the mare of Agheyli Jaber.’” And the Sultan Hassan hearing, struck his two palms together, And he cried, “O Abu Helal, thine is a case of evil. How hast thou staked thy life? Nay, rather leave this daring. Thine shall the camels be—ay, even the two thousand.” And I, “Alas, for shame! Such failure were unseemly. Or will I bring the mare or stand no more among ye, Nay, though my way be death.” Then answered Abu Musa, “Madman thou art and fool. This is beyond thy winning, Not though thy back grew wings.” And I, “Forbear vain pleadings. Base surely were the man less prompt to do than promise.” But next the Kadi came and fingered at his turban, And with him Rih my sister, and she called to him, “Helali, Wilt thou not stay this champion?” And I, “Nay, hold thy clamour Lest I should cut thee short, even with this sword, my sister.” And the Kadi: “Hear, O people. This warrior is foolhardy. Bring forth the brazen fetters to bind this Father of Patience.” And hearing, Abu Zeyd was wrath with wrath exceeding, And his hand set to his sword and “Ho,” said he, “ye mad ones! Talk ye to lay in fetter me who am named Salameh, Me, the strength of Helal, who clothed the tribe in glory? Nay, were it not for shame I would hew ye all in pieces.” And Rih cried, “Woe is me, the burning of my trouble! How shall I quench this flame? Yet shall he take our blessing.” And I, “The word farewell is but a wound to the goer. Cease, therefore, from thy tears.” And weeping thus she left me. But I my camel mounted and went my way in silence, Going by paths unknown in the wide, trackless desert, Nor turned my head again when they had turned back silent. Thus was our parting done. Shame rest with the gainsayer. II Said the Narrator: And when Abu Zeyd had made an end of speaking, and the Kadi Diab and the Sultan and Rih, and all had happened as hath been said, then the Emir Abu Zeyd mounted his running camel and bade farewell to the Arabs and was gone; and all they who remained behind were in fear thinking of his journey. But Abu Zeyd went on alone, nor stayed he before he came to the pastures of the Agheylat. And behold, in the first of their vallies as he journeyed onward the slaves of the Agheylat saw him and came upon him, threatening him with their spears, and they said to him, “O Sheykh, who and what art thou, and what is thy story, and the reason of thy coming?” And he said to them, “O worthy men of the Arabs, I am a poet, of them that sing the praise of the generous and the blame of the niggardly.” And they answered him, “A thousand welcomes, O poet.” And they made him alight and treated him with honour until night came upon their feasting, nor did he depart from among them until the night had advanced to a third, but remained with them, singing songs of praise, and reciting lettered phrases, until they were stirred by his words and astonished at his eloquence. And at the end of all he arrived at the praise of the Agheyli Jaber. Then stopped they him and said: “He of whom thou speakest is the chieftain of our people, and he is a prince of the generous. Go thou, therefore, to him, and he shall give thee all, even thy heart's desire.” And he answered them, “Take ye care of my camel and keep her for me while I go forward to recite his praises, and on my return we will divide the gifts.” And he left them. And as he went he set himself to devise a plan by which he might enter into the camp and entrap the Agheyli Jaber. And the Narrator singeth of Abu Zeyd and of the herdsmen thus: Saith the hero Abu Zeyd Salameh Helali: My tears flowed as I struck the swift one with her bridle, Turning her to the desert. And fifteen days I journeyed, Making of fifteen eight, for she was in fleetest training. And running I came to the herds of Agheyl and beheld the camels Spread like locusts alit, and I knew my travel ended. And lighting I stooped down, and tied her fast by the foreleg, And looked to right and to left. And presently the herdsmen Came with the slaves around. And “O thou Sheykh” they addressed me, “Whence and what man art thou? our stranger guest or a prowler?” And I, “A poet am I, a singing man of the singers, One from his youth afoot, the world's guest, and a stranger, Singing the praise of kings, the generous-souled, the noble.” And they, “A welcome, poet, to thee be eighty welcomes. Make thou a verse for us, display us of thy cunning.” And I, “I hear and obey, a thousand times obedient.” And I clutched at my rebab and set her strings in order, And took my bow in my hand, and making preparation Struck the notes for a song of the songs of the Hejazi. And I sang with reiteration, in four-and-twenty metres, Hymns in praise of the great, the glorious one, the Prophet, In measured phrase and verse, and afterwards recorded Noble deeds of the world, the gathered sheaves of wisdom, Giving to each its text. And last I came in my singing To him the generous one, Fadel the Agheyli Jaber. And they cried to me as I sang, “This Fadel is our chieftain. If but thou go to him he shall reward thee fairly With raiment of all choice, and jacynth stones and jewels, Perfumes and broidered silks, and purple and fine linen.” And I, “Quick, hold my camel. Anon will I be with ye.” And the herdsmen answered “Ay, and eighty thousand welcomes. If that thou bidedst a year, yet shall thy beast find pasture.” And I took my lute in my hand and sought his tent, the Agheyli, Speaking low to myself, “O thou Hejazi Salameh, This is thy day of deceit, the noontide of thy cunning. See to thy stratagems.” And I laid my wallet before me, Pondering ways and designs how I might come to my purpose. Said the Narrator: And when Abu Zeyd was on his way through the desert making to himself a plan how he should come into his foeman's camp unperceived, behold him of a sudden in the midst of them. And he saw the men of Agheyl to the right of him, and to the left, and in his front. And with them in their midst he saw a fair young lady, very beautiful to behold, with whom the fairest maidens of the Arabs were in converse. And the maiden turned her eyes to the desert and to the hills, and she perceived him coming. And she sent a young girl of those near her towards him. And the girl met him among the sand dunes and asked him “Who and whence art thou, and what is thy business?” And he told her that he was a traveller, of the pedlars who sell necklaces to the young maidens, and also that he was an hungred. And she brought him food and he ate, praising the Giver of all. And returning the girl told her mistress of his desire to serve her, and she bade him thread pearls upon a string and make settings for precious stones. And at once he set him to his work, and the young girl watched him. And he asked of her concerning the tents of her people and concerning the country where she lived. And she told him that the tents were set in three camps apart, and the first camp was for Fadel the Agheyli Jaber, and the second was for his daughter the Princess Alia and for the daughters of the Princes, and the third camp was for the mare. And she praised the worth of the mare and of her owner. And he said to her, “In this mare are there four qualities, and three of the four are for joy, but one is for joy and sorrow.” And when she heard this word the girl was very wroth, and she turned upon him and said, “Of a truth thou art no honest guest, but even a spy and a traitor, and for this purpose art thou come hither, to pry into that which is hidden.” And the Emir Abu Zeyd fled to the desert, and to himself he said, “When they of the camp shall be sleeping, then will I return and steal the mare and flee with her away.” And night fell, and he sat him down beneath a tree. Then once more the Narrator singeth: Saith the hero Abu Zeyd Salameh Helali: “Save me, O Lord, from hurt and the contradiction of evil, Take me, O Lord, by the hand, O Thou who hast power almighty, Thou who dost clothe with a veil, be Thou my guard and protector!” And I asked of the Merciful strength and patience to accomplish, Walking thus through the land of doubt, a land which is barren. And I reached my hand to my wallet and found in it things needful, And I took from it an onion and an egg-shell of the ostrich, And made a fire on the ground with twigs of the wild willow, And in a golden bowl I mixed and turned the ingredients, Then whitened I my beard and limned my face in wrinkles, Lowering my brows a little and darkening one of my eyelids, And I crooked my back like a bow, a bow bent for the shooting, And donned my clothes of disguise, that seeing none might know me. Thus sought I the plains of Agheyl when the sun was near to the westing, And hunger pressed me hard, for hunger is ungracious; And I cast my eyes around, and lo, like the stars for number, Stood the tents in their ranks, as it were the Pleiades in heaven, Each a cluster of stars; and among them a pavilion Set for a leader of men; and mares were tethered round it, And dromedaries trained as it were for a distant riding; And hard beside a tent of silk, a fair refreshment To the eyes as rain on the hills, the blest abode of women. And next in a lofty place, set on a windy platform, As it were a fortress in size, the booth of the great council, Wonderful in its spread, its length full sixty paces. And tears came to my eyes, for none in the world was like it. And all around were slaves. And at the tent-ropes standing Of a house of woven silk of the eighty there together, I saw a damsel proud, the Agheyli Jaber's daughter: Fifty attendants hers, mute girls who speak by signals. And Alia from afar with her fair eyes beheld me, And sent a maid to my help, of the maids that stood around her: Running she came to me, while her anklets rang and clattered, And her fair face shone like light, bent forward in her running, Shone like a moon in the dark, dividing her hair's blackness. And I prepared my words as a talker doth who is cunning. But she began, “O Sheykh of the Arabs, whence and whither? Comest thou here a guest, or one of our foes, a prowler?” And I said to her, “Lady fair, the boon I ask is a breakfast. I am a hungry man, and hunger is ungracious. Not till my lips have tasted food can I do thy bidding.” And she answered me, “O Sheykh, to thee be eighty welcomes. Hungry may no man be in the tent of Agheyli Jaber. Here is of all abundance, and ever the guests uprising, Praise his name who gave, a stream, a river of plenty. Wait thou that I may bring what shall not leave thee thankless.” And she left me and returned, and her hands were filled with dainties, Even with food for kings, meats worthy the world's great ones. And she stood before me in shame, as it were, a gazelle for coyness, Offering dates with her hands and butter and milk of camels. And I put my hand to the dates and still she pressed me ever; And I drank of the milk my fill, she bidding me still welcome, Health and a thousand welcomes, and last she asked me my story. And I said to her, “Ay, truly, thy mind will I enlighten.” And she said, “Speak truth and tell, Art thou and honest walker, Or one that prowleth around?” And I told her my condition, As one a stringer of gems, a necklace-maker for damsels. And she went and came again, and “Thus,” she said, “saith Alia, Wouldst thou rejoice her heart, then weave her a chain of value.” And I, “Then bring the wool, the first shorn of the camel.” And she brought me all I desired, and I wove the necklace fairly, Linking it like a chain. And I laid the threads together And ended all with a knot, and I strung it thick with rubies, Reciting still as I wove new texts from the Holy Scripture. And I charged her that her mistress should wear it night and morning. And she went and she returned. And “Thus,” said she, “saith Alia: Since that the night is at hand do thou remain in our dwellings. Meat is for thee and raiment.” And I, “As thy queen desireth. Yet, O thou fair one, say, Whose house is this pavilion? And who the warriors round? Belike they guard them a treasure.” And she, “That is nought to thee, so thou be an honest walker. Rather hold thy peace, lest these around suspect thee. This is the tent of Alia, and that of the Prince Agheyli, And that the third, apart, of the mare of Agheyli Jaber, The grey mare, the renowned: in the world there is none like her, Not with the Persian kings, the Chosroës, the Irani. Spare is her head and lean, her ears set close together; Her forelock is a net, her forehead a lamp lighted, Illumining the tribe, her neck curved like a palm branch, Her wither clean and sharp. Upon her chest and throttle An amulet hangs of gold. Her forelegs are twin lances. Her hoofs fly forward faster ever than flies the whirlwind. Her tail bone held aloft, yet the hairs sweep the gravel; Her height twice eight, sixteen, taller than all the horses. Here are her virtues told in full enumeration, Dear to her master's eye as gold and precious jewels.” And the grooms who heard her said, “Let not this guest despise her.” But she, “Nay, verily; so ye but fasten the hobbles.” And Salameh heard their talk and smiled, this prince of deceivers, And he said, “O maiden, hearken. I have a thing for thy hearing. So thou but speakest truth, the mare is indeed of the coursers. So thou but speakest truth, then are three flames extinguished. But of the fourth, the fiercest, behold thou stirrest the embers.” And the damsel heard him speak and answered straight in anger: “Bitter words are these, O Sheykh, as the edge of a dagger. Nay, by thy tongue I know thee, thou art no Sheykh of the great ones; Rather a prowler around, a spying thief of the camp-fires; One with a heart of blackness seeking our queen of coursers. Verily this thy speech betrayeth thee for a traitor; Verily she who hath ears hath heard thy words in amazement. Spying the land thou art come a traitor-guest to our pastures, Spying and stealing away the mare of Agheyli Jaber. Thus have I read thy riddle, the sense of thy dark saying. One to thy ear hath been and told the fame of her glory, Covetous-sick of the mare, in longing night and morning, Till thou didst rise and spread thy cunning nets for her taking, Hoping to win renown and hie thee home to thy people. These three things thou hast shown, the quenching of thy heart-flames, These three things, and the fourth to fire the wrath of her owner; Thus read I thy riddle, thy idle words I interpret. Now therefore take this counsel, get thee gone from our dwellings. Fly for the life thou hast nor linger here for its losing; Fly ere I send thee forth to death's unjoyful dwellings; Fly ere I spread the word and bring the Arabs upon thee, Mounted on steeds of speed to question me of thy doings; And I shall tell them truth, and yield thee to the spearpoints, Nor shalt thou succour find nor any to show thee pity.” And Abu Zeyd was grieved for what he had said to the damsel, Yet took he courage and cried, “Enough of this fool's talking. Never may fate befriend me if it have sense or meaning. Ha! the mare, what is she that I should wish for or win her? Never in all my days have I bent my leg to a saddle, Being of those unskilled, and little apt in the learning.” He spoke, and rose to go in anger, he the dark one; And she too to the camp, to her own tribe and people, Even to Alia's tent. But presently Salameh Passed on his way in doubt and fear and consternation, Thinking of those her words, hers with the plaited tresses, And, “O thou,” to himself he said, “thou innocent-minded! Thou forsooth the father of wiles, the old deceiver! How hath she laid thee bare and cozened thy beguiling, Reading all thy thought and making plain thy plottings! And she is gone from thee, and thou art alone unfriended, A stranger among foes, and who shall give thee shelter?” Then on his musing fell the depth of night and of darkness, And still Salameh pondered grieving his black fortune. And when it was fully night he cast his eyes in a circle, Where he might win a lodging in the wide, naked desert. And he spoke again to himself, “Salameh, thou the Hejazi, Now is thy hour to do, the occasion of thy cunning, For well hath the poet sung, he, Ibn Arus the singer, ‘The black night fell on the world, and lo, in its trail the prowler.’” And musing thus he passed beyond the farthest campfires, Till lo, a spreading tree at his hand with low-set branches. And Abu Zeyd rejoiced and entered within its borders, “And here,” said he, “will I rest, and sit me down till the midnight, Even till the break of dawn when the camp shall be unguarded, And I in my steps may turn unseen and all things accomplish, Making prize of the mare, and so to my own people.” III Said the Narrator: And when Abu Zeyd had sat him down beneath the tree, hehold him in a great anguish and trepidation and sorrow. And to him presently waiting thus there came a form approaching through the darkness, and he was astonished, and he said to himself, “What can this thing be? Climb rather, thou, O Abu Zeyd, into this tree, so that thou be hidden and learn that which shall come about.” And he climbed into the tree's branches like unto a raging leopard and watched narrowly the coming of the man, who stopped beneath the tree. And the comer was Sahel ibn Aäf; and Sahel waited looking ever to the right and to the left, and so till a third of the night was over. But at the last there came to him a lady, an exceedingly fair woman, and her name was Zohwa, the daughter of Nasser the Agheyli. And these two had between them an understanding of love, and he had promised that he would come that night to the tree, and she that she would meet him there. And he had waited long for her coming, until his heart was on the boil with his love and with the fire kindled within him. And he, even when she was come to him, believed hardly that he saw her with his eyes. And he went out to meet her and he asked her the reason of her delay. And she answered, “I waited for the eyes to sleep and until my father and my mother should be in their dreams, and as soon as they slept I came to thee. And now do with me all that thou wilt, for I am here before thee, nor am I miserly of my regard.” And on hearing this he forgave her, and he kissed her face, and she kissed his face, and they sat down and began to discourse together, Abu Zeyd the while crouching above and listening to their words. And he had a mind, for shame's sake, to slay them both; but he said to himself, “Let us first see how it shall happen.” And they fell to talking of the gossip of the Arabs, and presently they spoke of Alia. And Sahel became troubled and he said to Zohwa, “O that I could behold her! O that thou couldst bring her hither!” And she asked of him, “Why so? Is she then more beautiful than I? Are her eyes more fairly painted?” And he said, “Not so. But listen. I have had with her an adventure. It happened to me thus, that I was abroad in the desert and that I came to a certain fountain of sweet water, even that fountain in the which if one shall wash his garments he shall remain ever in health. And, as I approached it, behold the daughters of the princes of Agheyl seated on the banks of the stream, and their hair was loosened from the plaits, and I saw that their hair was dark as the descending night and that their eyes were painted with kohl. And looking thus and perceiving their beauty I became as one bewildered, nor could I turn away my eyes but remained staring and gazing, until at the last one of them was aware of me and called to the others, “Cover your faces, O girls, for there is a man hard by and I have seen him.” And Alia turned and saw me. And her anger was lit and she unloosed her tongue against me. And the others besought her that she should tell all to her father; and so turning they left me in great fear and apprehension of the trouble that might come of it. And I threw myself upon my face in the desert and I resolved that I would not return to the tents, for I mistrusted that Alia would give news of it to her father, and that he would seek my life and give me to taste of the cup of evil things. And so truly spake she of it to her father and told him all as it had happened. And he went out against me and came to my tent, and finding me not he slew my father in my place, and afterwards made it known that whosoever should find and kill Sahel the same should receive of him a reward, even all that he should ask for. And now, O Zohwa, I have but this one desire, to avenge the blood of my father by her destruction and to soothe my soul with slaying her, and after that I care not what may come, not though they hew me to pieces with their swords. And surely the news of her death at my hand would travel abroad and grieve the heart of Fadel and wound him so that he too should die.” And when Zohwa heard this story she bade him to be of good comfort, for that she would bring him to his heart's desire. And she said, “I will fetch thee Alia hither, and in a short space, for this is no far-off matter. Wait only until I return to thee, for see, my soul is not niggardly to thee of its regard.” And she left him and returned to the tents, and she sought the pavilion of the Princess Alia. And Alia, when she saw Zohwa, rose and went forward to meet her and made her sit beside her and inquired the cause of her coming. And Zohwa said, “O my lady, I am in a great perplexity, and therefore am I come to thee.” And she sat down beside her and told her a long tale of trouble and kept her thus talking through the night, and soothed her with soft words, deceiving her and flattering her with fair speeches of praise until she touched her heart with her cunning, nor did she cease from discoursing until a second third of the night was spent and there remained but these two awake of all the camp which was sleeping. Then Zohwa arose as if to go and she asked for leave to depart, but Alia besought her that she should stay with her and sleep there in the tent beside her. And Zohwa said, “Of a truth that would be before all things pleasant and for an honour to me, but I have been at pains to escape unperceived from my people and to them must I return.” And Alia hearing, was moved to pity and she said, “Go then.” And Zohwa went out of the tent and on a little way, but presently returned trembling as a ship trembles when it is struck by the wind, and she showed manifold signs of terror. And Alia asked her, “What aileth thee then?” And she answered, “O lady, I am overcome with lack of courage. And surely thou are responsible for me; but wilt thou not come with me a little way?” But Alia said, “Nay. For if I should go with thee, who afterwards should return with me? And see, the guards are sleeping, and my damsels every one of them. Nor am I too without danger of enemies who might do me a hurt, and, more than the rest, of that dog Sahel ibn Aäf.” And Zohwa answered quickly, “Say not so, O lady. And how should Sahel hurt thee, or how should any other, seeing that thou art the daughter of the prince of our tribe, the greatest of the princes, whose fame is in all the valleys? And yet thou speakest thus, thou daughter of the generous? Nay, it is no far journey. Listen: between thy tents and ours are but ten furlongs, for the space hath been stepped by the trackers, and if thou wilt come but one-half the road thou canst then turn back and I will go forward, and the way will have been thus divided between us and each will have accompanied the other and fear shall have been outwitted.” And Alia stopped at this agreement, for her wit failed her. And she arose and went with Zohwa out of the camp. And Zohwa's tongue wagged as they walked so that the way seemed short, and Alia lost reckoning in the darkness. And thus they came to the headland which stood at their mid-journey. And Alia knew nothing until, coming near the tree, suddenly Sahel leaped forth upon them. And Alia knew that it was he, and she cried aloud in fear. But Sahel seized hold of her by her neck ornaments and swore that if she cried out he would even cut off her head. And he began to use base language, and he said, “Now will I be avenged of the blood: and by the faith of the Arabs need is that I shall slay thee.” And she said, “To thy honour I appeal, O Sahel. So may God requite thee and save thee from the rage of Abu Zeyd the Helali.” And her heart became straitened, and her tears overran her cheeks, and she knew that that traitress had entrapped her. And she entreated him, saying, “First only let me recite the prayer, that the pang of death be assuaged.” But he laughed at her words, and said, “If thou be of the blameless, pray on.” And he went to Zohwa and kissed her, and Alia beheld it and wept at what had befallen her, appealing still to his honour. But he treated her scornfully, saying, “Dost thou not know him, this dog, this dog of dogs, this wolf, this slave, this jackal of the great? If thou hadst him in thy hand thou wouldst surely make him to drink of the cup of evil things. Now, therefore, behold, there is no escape for thee from the hand of the slayer.” And when Alia heard this she sundered herself from created things and turned her soul to the Recompenser and the Avenger, and her prayer was not hidden from the Maker of the Earth and from Him who upholdeth the skies. And she prayed with her arms extended. And the Princess Alia did not cease from her prayer to her Lord until Sahel had drawn his sword from his sheath and was pressing on her to seize her. And she cried out: “To my help, O Arabs! To my help, O strangers!” And suddenly a semblance and a form swooped down on them from above, as it were the coming of a lion from the tree. And behold, one with a drawn sword exceeding sharp, who cried, “Haass! Haass! Hold off from her, thou base born of the Arabs!” And when Sahel saw him his understanding left him and he was as one dazed and Zohwa with him, and they trembled. But Alia rejoiced, though she knew not from whence this champion had come down to her. And Abu Zeyd struck Sahel ibn Aäf so that his head fell back behind him. And the girl too he took and slew, and cast their bodies into a hollow place that the beasts of the field might devour them. And when he had done this he returned to Alia and undid her hands. And he bade her return to her tent and tell no man what had happened to her, of her people. And the Narrator once more singeth: Saith the hero Abu Zeyd Salameh Helali: For that which befell that night have my tears flowed unceasing, For that which that night befell, as I alone in the desert Turned to the right and the left my eyes (they are no deceivers), For I saw one come to the tree as though in search for a shelter. And I said to my soul: “O soul, climb thou and watch the achievement.” And my soul swung lightly aloft, and lay in wait in the branches. And he came as if to a tryst with one of the daughters of Adam, Even a tryst, O people, with one of our fairest daughters. And an hour passed, and behold a lady too in the darkness, Who said “Be thy evening good, O son of a noble father.” And he, “Two thousand greetings to thee and tokens of fortune. These—but what hath delayed thee, alas! thou daughter of Nasser?” And she said, “O worthy of praise, O Sahel, I watched and I waited, Even till all should sleep, my father first and my mother, And one by one my sisters and brothers. But when night held them, And all lay fast in the fetters of sleep, I arose for thy pleasure.” And Zohwa came to his side, and they sat on a mound together. And he, the dog, looked into her face, and each the other's Neck with their arms embraced. And I said to myself “Salameh, Wait thou in patience on (for he who hath seen is the wiser), And hear of them their tale and learn the fate and the judgment.” And their talk was of their neighbours. And anon he spoke of Alia. And she said, “I will bring her hither that thou mayst fill thy vengeance. Thou shalt be quits with her, with her of the plaited tresses: Even to-night will I bring her. But tell me first, and truly, Are her eyes darker rimmed than mine, more kohled, more painted?” But he, “Nay, nought of this. The trouble is far other. Rather list to my tale of woe and of strange adventure, A tale of fear and pain, a brimming over of trouble. For thus it was, to my hurt one day on my best courser Rode I forth to the spring, the fountain of Ridaä, There be there pleasant winds, full scented with rich odours, Sweeter than scent of flowers; and if a garment touch it, Ten days and more with musk shall it remain in fragrance. Forth by the dales I rode and travelled in my yearning, Till to my gladdened eyes behold, the fount Ridaä, And at the waterside the damsels and the daughters, Alia with all her band. And hence my earliest trouble. For I saw them there unseen, this goodly band of damsels, Dark, with their hair unbound, and those fair moons, their faces, (For some were as crescent moons, some half moons and some full moons) With brows divinely knit for their sad lovers' dooming, And eyes aflame to smite and pierce his soul like lances, And red cheeks, every one a rosebud newly blossomed, And noses curved and keen and finely shaped as sabres, Sabres upheld aloft in the skilled hands of swordsmen, And mouths like lover's knots, and teeth agleam like jewels, And necks, the wild roe's neck, on lavender new pastured And shih and all the herbs, the sweetest of the desert. By this was I undone. And one of the maidens saw me, Sprang like a fawn in fear, and called to her companions, ‘Alia! Ho, ye damsels, daughters of the great ones! Here is one watching us, one spying in the desert.’ And all looked up and saw where I stood plain, unhidden. And Alia cursing, cried, ‘O base son of perdition, Evil be on thy head.’ And they called to her and questioned ‘Who, then, is this bold man, hath dared be thus familiar With us the noble ones, the daughters of the Sultans?’ And she said, ‘He is none but Sahel, Sahel the son of Aäf, He of the evil word with sole shame for his fortune.’ And they bade her go to her father for that the prince might know it, And so take vengeance due. And Alia straight departed. And the sun had hardly risen ere he, the lady's father, Fell on my sire with the sword. And I fled before his anger, Weeping, to lands afar, and stripped of all, an outcast; For Jaber took our herds and servants and possessions, Two hundred fair milch camels, and my red mare, the swift one; And twenty months have gone since I beheld my people Or knew the sweets of home. O Zohwa, shouldst thou bring her, This Alia, to my power, thou shouldst behold a judgment, A tale of death for her, and for her father sorrow, Noised on the tongues of men till the last day of dooming.” And she, “I hear and obey, a thousand times obedient. Death shall be surely hers, and a supreme destruction.” And he, “Then compass thou the occasion of her coming.” And she, “So shall it be, thou glory of beholders.” And he, “Be up and doing, for lo, the short night waneth.” And she quickened her pace and went and came to the tent of Alia. And she drew the curtain aside and Alia rose to greet her: “Welcome to thee, O Zohwa, welcome, thou daughter of Nasser, How doth it fare with thee? Thou comest on what errand? Speak, what thou wilt is thine, even all thy heart desireth.” And Zohwa spoke dissembling, “My duty brought me hither, This and my love for thee and my great debt of reverence. I came to-night to thee in thought to do thee service, For fair discourse of friends is to the soul an unguent.” And Alia bade her welcome, ay, even eighty welcomes, And made her entertainment, for her heart smiled within her. And Zohwa clothed her words in garments of affection, And so talked through the night, two thirds of the night; but after Rose she and bade farewell. And Alia pressed her nearly, “Wilt thou not bide with me, for see, the short night turneth, Hardly an end is left, thy couch shall be spread quickly.” And she protested, “Nay, of a truth I dare not linger. None know that I am here, of my own house and people; Rather, if there be kindness, come with me thou a little, Half of my road, with me, O thou of the beautiful necklace.” And Alia, “Nay, in the night I too have cause of danger; The son of Aäf is my foe. Sahel, I fear him, the plotter.” And she, “Who is he, this man, this dog of the sons of the Arabs, That thou shouldst fear his intent who art the daughter of Jaber?” And Alia, hearing, arose and went and stood by the tent ropes And lingered there without, while Zohwa with false phrases, Wiled her still to her way. And she said, “My heart forebodeth, There is one lying in wait, even he the son of perdition. Let me return within.” But Zohwa, “Wherefore fear him? Is not thy father's name a terror in all the marches? Shall it not shield thee from ill, though sooth the wicked be many?” So they went forth together. And Alia's eyes misgave her Seeing a form in the dark. And she called out “What thing art thou? Art thou a passer by, or one with intent a prowler?” And he, the approacher, said, “Now truly art thou taken, Captured as in a net, and the Maker of Earth and Heaven Yieldeth thee to my hand and blindeth thee to thy peril.” And Sahel began to curse her, and to the tree he drew her. And she knew her hour was come, and her heart within was shaken. And he clutched with violent hands at her necklace as for strangling, Till at his feet on the stones she fell. Ah! pitiful maiden. And he bound her with cords and cried, “Confess thy faith ere thou diest.” And she entreated him, saying, “O Sahel, wilt thou not spare me? So may the Lord requite thee.” But he, “There is no sparing.” And to Zohwa she cried “This is he I feared, the son of perdition, And thou thyself art deceiver.” But she answered her with tauntings, “Be it so, I deceived thee. Go to. We shall see this Sahel Prove himself of his skill when he loppeth thee, legs and shoulders.” But Alia prayed to Sahel, “Do thou recite the Fatha, So shall the cup of death to my lips be found less bitter.” But he answered, “Wert thou blameless, so truly would I recite it; The Fatha is not for thee.” But she wailed aloud and lamented, “Alas, what death is mine. And, if he were here, my father!” And he asked: “Who then is he, thy father, O thou proud one? Nay, but humble thyself.” But she called the more, “Oh, hear me! God will visit this sin on thee and on her, ye traitors. Do thou but grant my demand and make my death less bitter. For he who dieth not on the day shall fall on the morrow, And he who scapeth the sword, the same by the spear is smitten, For all things have their days and courses and appointments.” And he said, “I grant thee respite. And after will I smite thee And give the death thou fearest.” And he spoke aside to Zohwa, “Sit we awhile apart.” And Alia raised up weeping Her beautiful eyes to Heaven, and she prayed to Him who hath pity, “O Thou searcher of hearts,” she said, “who knoweth the secrets Even of every heart, to Thee I look for compassion. Thou the merciful One, the Eternal, the most Mighty, Thou who art of Thyself, the giver of consolation, Thou the pitiful One, to Thee I come in my sorrow, Calling on Thee by the name of Thy deeds, the might of Thy wonders Done for those Thou didst choose to Thyself against unbelievers. To the prayers of the just I appeal that Thou protect me and succour, Staying the hand of the wicked man the son of perdition.” And to Ibn Aäf she said, “I appeal to thee of thy honour, So may the Lord thee spare, and heal thy soul of its blindness, Guarding thy head from the day of wrath, the spear of Salameh, From Abu Zeyd the dealer of blows, the lion avenger.” But Sahel answered, “Nay, by the Prophet I will not spare thee, Not though Abu Zeyd were here himself the Helali. For what is Abu Zeyd? Let him help thee, thou dog's daughter! Let him deliver thee from my hand, thou daughter of Jaber! Are we not, we the Agheylat, secure in our pastures? He, the Helali foe, where is he? In some far dirra, Pasturing flocks of his own. He shall not help thee nor succour.” But she, “Yet if God so willed he were here even now upon thee.” And Sahel, “Hold thy peace, for to-night thy life hath ending. What shall Salameh do to thy help in these our pastures? The wolf is not as the lion in the manner of his seizing. Were he here, Abu Zeyd, even now in this hour of speaking, Him would I smite to death and leave in his blood to perish.” And Abu Zeyd from the tree heard all the words between them, And my mind rose to her help as a full pot boiling over, And I heard my name in their mouths, and my heart grew hot within me, Like a pitcher from the well which brims and spills with fulness. For why should Sahel slay her, and I not stand between them? Sahel his sword hath drawn and leapt on her with cursings The while she cryeth aloud. But I too cried, “Take courage. Lo, I am here to thy hand, one able for thy burden.” And of a sudden I dropped and ran to the three that struggled. And Sahel I seized by the throat and dragged towards destruction. And he cried, “Who art thou and whence and what the way of thy sending?” And I, “From Death the King am I come to take possession. Life is weary of thee, and Death's edge presseth nearly.” And he, “O Sheykh of Afrits, wilt thou not spare the sword stroke? Lo, I turn from my sin in thought of the day of judgment.” But I, “Thou art but a heathen. Thou didst refuse the verses. Thou hast denied Our Lord. Thy heart is an unbeliever's. Thou hast done a treacherous deed. Thou hast angered thy Creator, Purposing death to souls, and therefore will I slay thee. For were it not for this, thy infidel denial Thus in act of thy God, my hand should spare to smite thee, Since that I love not strife nor is there blood between us.” And I put my hand to my sword and drew it from the scabbard, And it flashed as lightning flasheth, making a flame in the darkness, And I smote him with its edge and his head flew from his shoulders. And turning next on Zohwa I smote her too, while Alia Watched with the eyes of thanks the issue of the sword stroke. And I severed the cord from her wrists, and she rose and took her bracelets. And I bade her go in peace nor speak a word of the doings, When morning light should come, to tribesman or to kinsman, For ever the mouth is blest that holdeth its own counsel. IV Said the Narrator: Now when the Princess Alia had made her petition to the Maker of the Heavens, and her deliverance had been wrought by Abu Zeyd with the slaying of her enemies, and he had said to her, “Return and say no word of this to thy friends,” she besought him, saying: “Nay, but by Him who commandeth all power, I will not return home until thou hast told me of thyself, who thou art and of what tribe and nation of the Arabs.” But he said to her, “Know, O Lady, that I am of the race of the Jinns and that our people are indeed Muslims obeying the Lord of the Universe, and I was sent to thee from the land of Syria to deliver thee from that traitor, who was of the children of crime.” But she answered him, “Yet are not the Jinns of thy quality. Rather tell me the truth. I adjure thee by Him who created thee and in whose shadow thou didst grow up, and who hath wrought blessings through thy hand.” And being thus adjured he said, “O Alia, there were peril for me if I told thee truly all.” But she answered, “Be not afraid. Though thou wert the Prince Abu Zeyd himself, the Helali, yet shouldst thou have security, ay, even he that great horseman.” Then said he to her, “Stretch forth thy hand that we may make a covenant together, so shall God be our witness.” And she said, “As thou wilt.” Then they made them a covenant together in the name of God the Almighty, and their souls were loosed of their burden. And Abu Zeyd spoke to her and told her all, and said, “It was indeed none other than I that slew thy uncle, nor came I with a better purpose than to steal away that mare.” And she said, “Now is my heart light and my trouble ended, and as for the mare, look for her at my hand and not through another road; for my uncle and my people, are they not at thy disposal? And if there hath been evil how shall we take vengeance now, for I and my wealth and my kindred, all that is mine is thine. And thou shalt not find us niggardly of our kindness to thee, nor shall we refuse thee aught, inasmuch as all that I might do for thee, whether I fast or whether I pray, whether I give or whether I bestow, never might I make up to thee for what I have received at thy hand. Therefore shall there evermore be kindness between us. Ay, and if thou be willing, come thou now to our camp.” But he said to her, “O Alia, O fairest lady, know that this I cannot do, this I desire not.” And when Alia heard this word, it deepened her regard for him, and she praised God who had ordered it that she should meet with one so honourable. And she perceived that to one such as was this brave knight she could entrust her soul and all that was hers. And she entreated him, “Come with me to the tribe.” But he, “Never can I come with thee.” And still she besought him, saying, “Know this, O Hejazi Salameh, that I will not leave thee here nor depart from thee. And as to the mare, her will I deliver to thee and whatsoever else thou demandest. Nay, though it were my soul I would not deny it.” But he answered her, “My mind is changed about the mare, nor would I now take her, for I fear lest they seeking and not finding her should suspect thee, O Alia, and trouble should come to thee of thy father. And have we not the grey mare of Diab with us, the Shohba, whom we may give to the lady, nor run this great risk for her sake?” But Alia insisting said, “Nay, that shall not be, nor care I what may come, not though I should taste of the cup of evil things. But if thou wilt not take the mare, then will I kill her and myself with her, and on thy head be it for her and for me.” And Abu Zeyd consented, saying: “I will do what thee seemeth good. So may God prosper thy designing.” And the Narrator returned to his singing of that which happened between the Princess Alia and the Prince Abu Zeyd. Saith the hero, Abu Zeyd Salameh Helali: Thus was our meeting made, mine with the Princess Alia. The cause in the beginning of all was a mother bereaved, A mother who came in her need where I sat with the chiefs assembled, And told us her desire, the mare of Agheyli Jaber. And I pledged my soul to her prayer I would bring the mare, and straightway Went I forth nor tarried, seeking his tent the Agheyli. And I made my plot to entrap her, standing unknown among them. And how I came to this tree she knoweth it, Jaber's daughter, And how with my hand I snatched her life from the hand of the wicked. And I said to her, “Lady, return and be content with thy fortune, Speak no word of it all, of that which hath befallen. Keep thou close thy secret. So shall they do thee honour.” But she, “To return were grief, O dark one, sweetest of faces. Nay, by an oath I adjure thee, even by the House, the Kaaba, Tell me thy tribe and dirra, and who be thy nearest kinsmen.” And I, “I hear and obey. With the Jinns am I in kindred. Kings are we of the great, Berkhan is my father's brother, Shemhurish and Tayar are next to me for cousins.” But she, “Not so, the Jinns are not of thy human nature. Tell me the truth of thy tribe, and which of the sons of Adam: All that thou hidest speak.” And I said to her, “Behold me, Now will I tell thee all (and may the deceivers perish). Behold me, him who came to string for thee thy necklace, And thou gavest him dates to eat and for drink the milk of camels. And thy damsel chid me saying, ‘There is no nobility in thee. By my faith thou art no Sheykh, rather a spy and a traitor.’ And I was afar in Sham at the evening hour when thou calledst, Crying aloud for help, and I snatched thee from thy peril.” And I said, “Now go in peace, thou daughter of the Princes.” But she held me by the neck and stretched her arms entreating. “Tell me thy tale,” said she, “for know, I am Jaber's daughter; Why shouldst thou fear to speak? Tell of thy tribe and people, And peace be with thee ever, even to the day of judgment. Alia am I of Agheyl, and Fadel is my father: First of the horsemen he, the mightiest, the most noble, And my mother's name Kanua, one of illustrious lineage. Tell me thou of thy Arabs, thy house and thy connexion, So shall my heart be at rest.” But I, “Alas, O Alia, What if the news should fly, and thy tribe slay the stranger? Stretch forth thy hand to me, in covenant between us, Whoso then shall betray, let him be as an unbeliever.” And I stretched my hand to her hand and touched it with my fingers. And its softness made me wonder, and its most slender fashion, And the palm of her hand in mine was cool as a cloud in summer. And I placed the veil between us, and we held fast by the girdles, And I recited the oath and sealed with a prayer our treaty. And I cried aloud, “I am Abu Zeyd, he and no other, Salameh, chief of Amer, the slayer of thy kindred. For I slew Zohan, and Abu Tolh, and Fakhr, and Khodel, Leaving their kith in pain with lovelocks shorn from their foreheads. Mine is the arm of valour which made Helal victorious, Mine the vow of succour to all in need distressful.” And Alia heard me speak and stood up tall before me, Like to one making a cry, but I shut her mouth with my hand's palm. And hot tears came to my eyes, and “Cry not,” I said, “O Alia, Cry not for pity aloud, lest I fall in a sea of trouble.” And she said, “My cry was unwilled, for thy love my whole heart filleth, And now fear is forgot. And O, Abu Zeyd Salameh, Know that we twain must love, for I am of noble lineage, Even as thou thyself, the hero, the lion of Amer.” And I said, “Now listen, Alia, to that which I would tell thee: Love is a building fair, broad based on sure foundations. And the builders built it high as was no other dwelling.” And she said, “Thou speakest truth. And love is of three conditions, And to men of understanding each hath a sign to know it. The first compelleth thee to kiss the hand thou lovest. This is a moment's love. The next is more enduring, Which kisseth thee on the cheek. But there is yet the latest, Love which shall kiss thy forehead. This is a love for ever. Mine is of all the three. And for my soul's consoling, Come thou to our camp.” But I said to her, “O Alia, In this thou art to blame. I dare not on such venture, Being a seeker still of that which was my questing.” But she said, “The mare is mine. My own hand shall unloose her. With me are her hobbles' keys, by night will I unlock them. The keys lie in a goatskin, a goatskin filled with water, And that deep in a well. There lieth our secret hidden. And all are mine to deal with, goatskin and keys and hobbles. Therefore do thou give ear—nay, be not thou despising. For as the mare is mine, so am I thine to deal with. Let us arise and go, thou, I, and the mare together, Even to thine own tribe.” But I, “My thought is elsewise, No more I seek the mare, nor is my mind to take her, For have we not the Shohba, the grey mare of Ibn Ghanem? Her will I give in ransom for the mare of Agheyli Jaber. Nay, for I fear for thee, lest evil should befall thee, Through the tracking of the mare, thou daughter of the great ones, Evil and sore disgrace which all men should remember.” But she said, “No, of a truth. And, if thou spare to take her Then will I slay her straight. For how many more beside her, Stand not tied at our door, mares like to her in value? And for myself, alas, the poison cup stands ready, And I will go with her to death's unjoyful dwellings.” And when I heard this word, need was that I consented. Said the Narrator: And when the Princess Alia and the Emir Abu Zeyd had finished talking in the manner told, and she perceived that his mind was truly on the mare, and that for her sake only he doubted, then answered she him thus and said, “Behold, I will arrange this thing for thee, even if in its accomplishing my soul should pass away, for in truth the mare is precious to my father, more precious than am I his daughter.” And Abu Zeyd, hearing this, pondered a long while, even for an hour in silence. And she asked him, “What aileth thee, O Helali Salameh?” And he said, “If I should take the mare, of a surety thy father would question thee of her, and he would learn the truth, and maybe he would treat thee ill for her sake. And for this cause hath my mind changed that I will not take her. And there is verily the grey mare of Ibn Ghanem, the Shohba, and her we could put in her place.” But she said to him, “Nay, that may not be, not though I should drink of the cup of bitterness. And, if thou dost not take her, surely will I slay the mare and my own self after her, and thou alone shalt be responsible to her Lord and to my Lord. So come down now this very hour to the camp, and I will arrange all the matter.” And he answered her, “Do thou go before, and I will follow after thee on the morrow.” But she said, “Nay, but come thou now with me.” And she desisted not until he came with her to the tents. And she made a place for him of honour on a rich carpet, and she herself ministered unto him, speaking him words of welcome. And she brought him the ewer, that he might wash and pray. And for this he praised God. And he needed sleep, so she said to him, “Sleep here in peace, for I am mindful of the covenant made before God between thee and me.” And he slept. And this was after that he had eaten and drunk, and refreshed himself. And behold the dawn lightened. And Alia brought him water, and he prayed. And she brought him something of food, and he praised the Lord of all creatures. And she set him in the seat of honour, and she hung around him curtains of silk, and he slept. Then she left him and went to the Assembly. And the Narrator once more singeth: Saith the hero Abu Zeyd, the Helali Salameh: Of that which befell, O people in wait for information, Hear and list to my words, “O Alia, daughter of Jaber, Leave me here and go thy way to thy tribe and people. Leave me here. With the rising sun shalt thou see me coming.” But she, “O Abu Zeyd, thy life with mine is knitted. Thy soul is as my soul. Be not for me in trouble.” And she set her hand on my neck, and held me and implored me. And I, for all I feared, went home with her unwilling. And she led me within to a couch, a couch spread soft with cushions, Four-square with curtains round and netted thick with jewels, (A castle you had deemed it). And she said, “O thou Salameh, Now hast thou made us glad, for see, the tribe rejoiceth. To-day is white through thee, O prince, O lion of Amer.” And she brought the basin and ewer, and stood there in her beauty, Shining, unveiled, her hair in plaits which hung to her girdle. And I washed and prayed alone, as is ordered by the precept. And anon she came again, and in her hand she brought me Somewhat that I might eat, meats fit for kings, in dishes. And she said, “O Abu Zeyd, there is time if thou wouldst slumber. And she spread a bed before me with her own hands for sleeping; And sprinkled it with musk, sweet-scenting all the chamber. And she of the plaits returned, and yet again, with coverings, Like a gazelle, I deemed, the wild fawn of the desert. And her eyes! May God be praised if thou shouldst gaze within them! A bird as it flew might fall, from its midmost way beholding. And on her cheek a dimple guarded near with roses. And wrists and hands how soft! Glory to Him in heaven, Who fashioned thus her beauty, this daughter of the great ones. At the break of dawn she came, her countenance all shining, And she brought me the ewer filled, and I made my supplication, And praised the Lord of Might, the Merciful, the Creator. Said the Narrator: And when the day broke and Abu Zeyd had made his prayer, and Alia had entered and bidden him good morrow, and had said, “Thou hast made us glad, O Abu Zeyd, with thy presence,” and he had answered her, “God bless thee,” then came she to him with food and he ate, and he arose. And she set out the couches and put all in order, and commanded that the drums should be beaten to summon her young companions, and she said to them, “Rejoice with me, and prepare of all things in abundance, for a great happiness hath come to me and the extreme of favour.” Then sat they all around her and made display of joy, and all care vanished. And when the damsels were complete in their number, then returned she to the Hejazi Salameh and said to him, “Come, take thy place with me in the Assembly of the daughters of the Arabs.” But he said to her, “O Alia, my desire was that I should remain secret, and behold thou wouldst make all things known.” But she: “What matter? Fear nothing, for the souls of all of us are thine, and no harm shall befall thee, and we are a ransom for thee.” So she brought him with her and set him on a throne of gold by her side. And, when the daughters of the Arabs saw that, they looked the one at the other and whispered among themselves. And the Emir Abu Zeyd wept aloud and lamented. And Alia perceived that he was weeping, and asked of him the cause. And he said, “It is by reason that they speak lightly of us.” But she said to the damsels, “This great one hath saved me from an evil death, and ye do not well to laugh. And an honourable man is he, nor would he do aught worthy of blame.” And at that, the minds of the young girls were set at rest, and they said to her, “Were we in thy place so would we also do.” And Abu Zeyd was comforted, knowing that they would keep all things secret. And the Narrator began to sing: Saith the hero Abu Zeyd the Hejazi Salameh, When I entered the camp and the tribe, and stood in their midst the dwellers, And the day dawned in the heaven, and my prayer had been repeated, Then came Alia greeting and bade me a fair morning, And I gave her back the salute, the noble daughter of Jaber. And she said again, “Good morrow to thee, O Abu Mukheymer, How hast thou done us honour, thou noble prince of the great ones!” And Alia sought the pavilion where the thrones were set in order, Eighty towards the right and sixty thrones to the leftward, And fifty more at the front with stuffs embossed with jewels, For there had Alia placed them. And the drums of joy were beaten That the Princes' daughters might hear and come forth at her bidding, And forth anon came they with trailing robes of saffron, And sat them on the thrones of Agheyli, the noble maidens. And they asked, “What mean the drums, O thou our Prince's daughter? What meaneth thy rejoicing?” And she, “Rejoice, O Damsels.” And Abu Zeyd the while lay close in the tent hidden. And she bade the fair ones sit, the daughters of the great ones. And she fetched a throne of gold inlaid with crusts of jewels, And went to Abu Zeyd and bade him to the Assembly. And he reproved her, saying, “Thou art a Prince's daughter; Have we not sworn an oath to keep this matter secret? And wilt thou blazon it round with these tongue-wagging damsels? A secret is for two, or four at the most, for keeping. But what and where is it laid bare among a thousand?” And she bade him cease his doubt nor thus mistrust the damsels. And she led me, and I went shamefaced and in amazement, The damsels watching near and whispering to each other, With their veils drawn to their faces. And Alia stood before them, And with her Abu Zeyd, and she bade me straight be seated. And she sat down by my side, a wild roe from the desert. And we seemed a bridal pair, on thrones of gold, newwedded, And we watched the sport and play, the festival of rejoicing. And the damsels each at each looked and at us, in whispers Asking, and half aloud, “Who then may be this stranger, A prince? a noble born? a man of race and lineage? Watch well his garments, ye, his bearing, his demeanour, Surely he something hath of king-like in his gesture.” And one cried, “Hearken all, and I will read the riddle. This is a holy man, one unacquainted with women, Strange to the wearers of plaits.” And another, “Nay, I tell ye, And let my word be heard, This Sheykh is of the great ones, Else or a wise magician, whom Alia entertaineth For some occult design—that, or a spy and prowler.” And Abu Zeyd was aware of these their words and guessings, And his heart within him sank, and his head dropped, and his tears flowed, And Alia, when she saw him downcast, “How now, Salameh, Art thou thus faint of heart?” she cried to her sad lover. But he, “The thing hath come of which I feared, O Lady, And these light-minded girls make speech of us for evil. This is a Sheykh, saith one, and that, a spy, a prowler. But know a sherif am I, my grandsire was Mohammed. The truth it is, O Lady, I am of this proud lineage.” And she called to them, “Shame on ye, and shame on your suspicions, Ye daughters of my people, ye fair ones light of fancy. List, I will tell ye all within my oath's prescription, (Yet were a breaker of oaths but cast away to perish) I am the Agheyli's daughter, the noble born, I Alia. And whoso of ye all, ye fair ones, speaketh evil, The same hath done me wrong. And which of ye, O damsels, Is of my high condition? And which hath longer hairplaits, Or is of darker eyes? And when was I blameworthy? Where is my fault? Nay, truly, were it but yours to keep it, My oath should bind ye too. Speak rather in all plainness, And I will hear ye out, for true words are a precept.” And they said, “Thy oath is binding. Thou doest well to keep it, And to betray were sin, ay, even the seal of perdition. We are thy witness all, thy whole life hath been blameless, A luminous life and fair, beseeming thy high lineage: Daughter of glorious sires, none might presume to blame thee. Only we wondered somewhat to see thee with this stranger, For thou treatest him as brother, and thee thyself as sister, And we were astonished thereat, and our minds fell in doubting, And we talked and questioned still, and argued it together.” But she, “O damsels, hear me. Did ye but know his merit, Ye would sell all to possess him, he being of the great ones, A prince of noble lineage, a mighty man of valour; This is he, the renowned, who made Helal victorious, Abu Zeyd Salameh, the Hejazi, and none other.” And they answered, “Fear thou nought. We will keep close thy secret, For that which thou hast done we too had surely done it. We will be to thee in this to the end of thy heart's wishes, And to him too, to the end. No ear shall learn it of us.” V Said the Narrator: And when the maidens and Alia had made an end of their talking, and they had said to her, “Fear not, we are with thee, and of nothing of our souls will we be niggardly for thy sake, and all that thou hast done that too would we have done; and one such as is this knight were more worthy our possessing than all else in the world, for he is without guile and without blemish;—then Alia, hearing this, her heart was quieted, and she arose full of joy, and bent down and kissed the hands of Abu Zeyd. And all the damsels in like manner kissed his hands. And they undid their veils before him to the right and to the left. And Alia bade them bring meats in dishes, and the damsels brought them. And the servants and they rejoiced and were glad together. And when their meal was ended they brought wine and drank of it, and made merry until night fell on them. And they sang psalms and canticles, and played on instruments of music, nor did they leave their merriment for twenty nights, so that Abu Zeyd forgot his people, and it was to him as to one who had been born among them, nor cared he for aught that should happen in the land of Helal. But on the twenty and first night he remembered where he was, and how he had come thither, and the story of the ancient dame who had sought him and the pledge he had given her to obtain for her that which she desired. And tears came to his eyes and flowed down upon his beard. And when Alia saw this she arose and asked him why he wept. And he said, “I have been remembering my people, and those that are dear to me afar and the business that I came on.” And she said, “Wait only till it be dark.” And he waited until the night came. And she arose and fetched the keys and delivered to him the mare. And she brought him change of raiment and a skin of dates and butter and bread. And she said, “Take me also with thee with the mare, and leave me not to suffer blame.” And she clung to his stirrup. But he swore an oath to her that he would return and protect her from her father. And she let go the stirrup. And in that guise he left her, and they were both weeping. And Alia turned from him with weeping eyes, and lamented grievously at their parting. And he went his way through the desert, while she remained in her sorrow. And she sat upon the ground with the daughters of the great ones, and they burst forth all in lamentations and tears. Then singeth again the Narrator: Saith she, the Princess Alia (and the tears flowed from her eyelids), “Ho, ye daughters fair of my tribe, to my words give heeding. Be ye my secret's keepers. This one by his fair actions Hath earned the better part, ay, praises everlasting. Let every creature praise him, and God him keep, the Creator.” And they said, “We hear and obey, a thousand times obedient. Our souls shall thy ransom be to hold our lips close-guarded.” And Alia went to him, and his right hand and his left hand Kissed she, and they too all, while the dark one stood astonished. And they said, “May God reward thee with good and grace and blessing. Oh thou Emir Salameh, champion among the great ones.” And they called to Alia loudly, “Lady, thou daughter of Jaber, Bid that the meats be spread, and feast we with this stranger.” And they brought the fruits and the meats, and the dishes meet for Princes. And when the meal was done then poured they fair potations, Drinking in jewelled cups with skilled musicians and singers, (Where should the like be found?) for they sang in such sweet measure That, if a bird had heard, it had stooped from its way in heaven. In figure and trope they sang, of four-and-twenty stanzas. And Alia chose eight players, the cunningest among them, Four for the lute and viol, and four for hymns and chauntings. Each sat him down and played, and they sang with pleasant voices. Thus twenty nights went by as a single hour in swiftness. And it seemed to me my life had been ever thus from its outset, Till I forgot Helal, even Helal Ibn Amer. Then suddenly the thought came to me of my people, My tribe and my high place, my friends and war companions, And tears ran down my face: I did not seek to stay them, But sat as a man crazed. And Alia, when she saw me, “What aileth thee, Abu Zeyd, and what may be thy trouble?” And I said, “O Alia, see me how I thus late remember My glory and my tribe, and friends, and war-companions; See, I have lingered here these twenty nights in number In this thy stranger tribe. And how then shall I end it? Arise and bring the mare, and see that thou delay not, If thou be one of trust.” And she, “I will surely bring her, And may the merciful God, O Prince, make smooth thy journey. For truly saith Ibn Arus, ‘The dark night brought the prowler.’” And I said, “I hear and obey,” yet ceased not to be troubled Until the night should come. But near the hour of sunset Alia arose and said, “It is time.” Then like a lion Rose I, and roared, “I hear and obey, thou daughter of Jaber.” And Alia threw off her jewels, and she went out and I followed With a loud-beating heart to the space beyond the tent ropes, And we walked in the space apart 'twixt Alia's and the mare's tent. And she held my hand as I went, like a lioness, I like a lion. And when we had come to that other tent, then she gazellelike Stepping passed to the well, and into its depths went Alia. And presently came again with a goatskin filled with water. And she took from it the keys, and she opened wide the stable, For the night was dark, and within we heard the mare's feet stamping, Yet stayed she at the sound of her step, the Agheyli's daughter. And Alia stooped and loosed from the mare her fetters of iron. And I led her forth in joy, the mare, nor hid my pleasure. And she brought the saddle in haste, and bound it fast with its girthing, And she hung to it a nosebag as ready for a journey. And I with my hand the while set on her head the bridle. And she stood at the mare's near side, and close behind the saddle. And she said, “Yet leave the cords, lest they be thy undoing.” And I left them on the ground, cords of the red silk twisted. And she came beside me near, and held me by the fingers, And said, “O Abu Zeyd, give ear to me and hearken.” And she brought me all of the best, and a fair change of raiment, Garments rare of glory, rejoicing the beholders. And she said, “O Abu Zeyd, leave here thy ancient garments, And put on these, the new, O thou illustrious hero.” And I named the name of God, and I put on the raiment. And clothed I stood as a King, even as one of the Sultans. And she brought me too the armour of the Emir Zohaneh, And a sword from the land of Yemen, its blade was sharp and shining, And girt it to my left side. And I loosed it from its fastening, And drew the blade from its sheath, and stood like the King of Terrors. And I went to the grey mare's side, and took her rein in silence, While Alia wept aloud and her tears ran down in streamlets. And I named the name of God and sprang into the saddle, And touched the mare with my heel. But Alia still delaying Put in my hand a spear (its point would split a pebble, And it shone in the night like a star) and I bore it on my shoulder, And my heart leapt high with valour, and I longed to meet the tribesmen And charge them one and all, alone, I without helper. And fain was I they should wake that I might give them battle, And drive them with my sword, their mightiest men of valour. And she brought me dates in a skin, and made me all provision. And thus was I. And she, still clinging to my stirrup, Cried, “Let me go with thee, astride the mare, behind thee. Let me be with thee still while he my father liveth.” But I said, “Nay, yet I swear thou shalt not be forsaken, Nor will I seek Helal till first I come back for thee, Having devised a plan.” Then drew I away my stirrup, And the tears ran down my face, and my heart was grieved within me. And I went forth on my way and heard her still lamenting, Even as I rode afar. For she cried on, “O Salameh, Haste thee back, for thy going is as a fire that burneth.” And she turned to the pavilion, and sat down on the carpet, The carpet of amber silk. And, “Where is he, Salameh?” She cried to the pavilion. “If he come not back to seek me, Lo, will I burn thy hangings and tear the hair thy covering. If he cometh not, Salameh, a tomb shall be my dwelling. And yet the time shall be we shall both meet together: For this be praise to God the Lord God the Almighty. And I ask my pardon of God for all sins and transgressions, Him who is my protector in the high Heaven of Heavens.” VI Said the Narrator: And when the Emir Abu Zeyd had departed with the mare, and had taken his leave of the Princess Alia, and had passed into the outer pastures, then remained the Princess a long while weeping at his going, and in doubt how she should meet her people, and in fear of what might come to her through the stealing of the mare. And she returned to her tent, and threw herself upon her bed, weeping with both eyes. This for her. But as to the Emir Abu Zeyd, he too fell adoubting as he rode; and he said, “If I go back now to the Arabs, mine own people, and to my business, nor take thought of Alia, it will certainly happen that our doings will be made known, and her father will slay her; and, on the other hand, if I should return to her, it will be a matter of long duration, and I shall be a great while withheld from my people and my affairs. Now, therefore, it were better I should go see that which is happening among them.” And he stopped at a fountain of water, and he drank of it, and he gave his mare to drink. And he sat him down to think over all his plan, and he remembered the day of judgment, and the oath that he had taken to Alia that he would return to her before going to his own people. And this is what happened in the case of the Emir Abu Zeyd. And at this point the Narrator began once more to sing, and it was in the following verses: So did my thought return to the Helali Salameh, When he took with him the mare, and set him to do his purpose, With all that him befell, O men, among the great ones. The grooms of the mare went in to the grey mare to groom her, Entered within her tent, and found a lantern burning, Yet found they not the mare, nor token of her presence. And they fell in consternation, O people, and much doubting. And they cried, “Alack-a-day! To our help, O men, O warriors! The grey mare of the King is not. Ho, ye of courage, Go with the news straightway. Tell the Agheyli Jaber.” And a tumult vast arose in all the neighbouring camp-fires. And the Emir Fadel came, confused with the much shouting; And he called to them aloud, “O warriors, wherefore shout ye, Casting the camps in fear, as though the foe were on ye?” And they brought him a kassás, a cunning man, a tracker, One learned in all signs, that he might search the desert. And lo the footsteps ended at the tent of Alia. Then were there wondering looks among the camel riders, And a thousand horsemen rode, Fulano and Fulano, Every name of worth, a gallant band of fighters. And the hero Abu Zeyd lifted his eyes, and saw them, Like locusts on the plain. And he tightened his mare's girthing, And called aloud to all, “Come on, if ye have courage.” And they gathered near and near, and the dust of their hard riders Rose like a cloud to heaven. And presently they saw him, And he could see their eyes, and the flashing of their spearpoints. And the foemen called aloud, “O thou of the race of Himyar, Thou shalt not flee our wrath, not though thy back grew pinions. For he thy sire of old came thus. And thou, what wouldst thou?” And to them Abu Zeyd, “My right lies in my spear-point. Wait rather, all of ye, that I may prove your boasting.” And I charged, said Abu Zeyd, and lo I was among them. And the din of battle rose, and the clanking of the swordblades, And I could not count their numbers spread on the plain like locusts. Roaring they came on me with the loud voice of lions. You had said a cloud in heaven struck by the bolts of thunder. And to my soul I said, “O thou Helali Salameh, To fly were shame on thee. Nay rather fear thou Alia, Lest she should send for news how thy back turned in battle.” And I saw my death by the spear as the best of doubtful issues. “Death is better than talk,” I said, “the words of the idle, Ay, than the words of disgrace. So go I to destruction, Nay, though I win to my tomb in the day of evil fortune.” And I turned my mare and sprang, like a lion in the seizing, And I pressed her flank with my heel and sent her flying forward, And I charged home on their ranks, nor thought of wound nor danger. And I smote them with my sword till the air shone with smiting. And I met them once and twice with stark blows homeward driven. And they pressed me left and right as the high banks of a river, Even the River Nile in the full day of its flooding, When the whirlpools sweep with might and overwhelm the bridges. Twenty foes and five fell down before me smitten, Nor cared I them to slay, being of Alia's kindred, But tumbled them on the ground with sharp taste of my spear-point. And they turned back in confusion, each man to his own dwelling, While I pursued them still as the King Death pursueth. And I pricked them with my spear from the first third to the latest. And they stopped, and charged, and rallied the while I pressed and smote them. And I saw again their eyes, and again they pressed me sorely, Till I put my care on the Lord, the Lord God the Creator, And all my load on him, the Prophet, the Muhajer. And I feared—they were so many—lest they should take or slay me, Yet trusted I the Lord, who is a Lord of mercy. But about the hour of the Doha there came at me a horseman, And he cried out, “I am he, the son of Agheyli Jaber, Suliman men me call, the bravest of the bravest.” And he shouted to me, “O slave, is it thou, thou thief of horseflesh? Thou who smitest our people, and makest naught of our great ones? Show us here thy courage. Get thee to the fight, thou dark one.” And I charged on him like a lion, a lion roused to the seizing, And before my wrath he fled, nor found I one to withstand me. Nor stayed he of his running till at the tents of the women, Even the tent of Alia, hers with the plaited tresses. And I pressed him close behind, and drove him to the tent ropes, And Alia came out, crying, “May the great God thee succour, Even as He succoured Him who fled to the noble city. Fight thou on in all heart, nor fear the sons of the Arabs, O thou worthy of praise, for these Agheylat are boasters. Fight with the whole of Agheyl, O thou redoubtable hero.” And when they heard her words, the horsemen stayed in their running, And seemed to take new thought in council with their great ones, And at her railings stopped and looked at one another; And each to the other said, “She knoweth, then, this champion. Hers is the fault of the mare, the grey mare of our chieftain, Hers the treachery is. What further need we trouble, Spending ourselves in vain, with treachery behind us? Rather return we straight, and tell the Agheyli Jaber Of the goings on in the camp, and that which was in his dwelling.” And they turned to the Emir Fadel, the high Prince, the Agheyli. And he asked them, “Saw ye aught of the enemy of our people?” And they said, “Ay, saw we him thine own grey mare bestriding, And he turned on us as a lion, a lion roused to the seizing, Dark-hued, beautiful-faced, and noble in his anger. And he drew his blade on us all, as it were the flash of the lightning. Many were we, he one, nor was there any beside him. Much we wondered to see him thus, O worthy of honour! One alone he fought with us all, nor had he a helper. And he drove us back from the field, our horse and camel riders, He on the mare thou knowest, and following close behind us. Thus we came to the camp, we first, and then the stragglers, All of us fighting the hero, and no man looked to his fellow. And so till the sun was high and the day rose to the Doha. Then came thy son to our help, and he too fled from the fierce one, Fled with a doubting heart, sore struck, to the tent of Alia. And Alia, seeing this thing, came forth beyond the tent ropes, And called aloud to the foe, and prayed for his more glory. And little account made she of the trouble of her people. Yet succoured she thy son. Though he, the adversary, Is all the thing of her care, nor careth she for another. And when this case stood clear, then said we each to other, ‘Alia the stranger knoweth, the grey mare she hath given. Hers the treachery is, thy daughter's, Agheyli Jaber.’ Therefore left we the foe, and came we here before thee. Laying thee bare our case. And this is our tale and story. And what hath been to the mare is clear to all the people.” VII Said the Narrator: And when the Agheyli Jaber heard this talk he was overcome with trouble, and it seemed as though his understanding had flown from him and his senses. And he said, “Bring Alia before me.” And they made haste and went to her, and bade her, “Go, for thy father calleth thee.” And she obeyed, and went with them before her father. And he said, “O wicked one, what is this that I learn of thee and thy deceits, and that thou art the reason of the loss of our mare, and that thou didst call down a blessing of victory on our foeman when he had wounded thy brother Sulyman, and that thou gavest him in ransom and all our people for that other?” And she said to him, “Yea verily, for I know this enemy, and it is I that gave to him the mare; and wert thou acquainted with his worth, thou wouldst surely give him (and it would be a pleasure to thee) all thy wealth and thy possessions and everything that thou hast.” But when he heard these words of her, the matter appeared to him still more of moment. And he called on those near him to bind the girl by the shoulders, and to bring wood and lighted coals to burn her withal, that she might presently taste of the cup of death. And at his word they fell upon her, and bound her; and they kindled a fire, and brought her to it, and it remained only that they should cast her thereon. And Alia beheld this that was prepared for her, and her heart fainted with fear. This, then, is what happened to Alia, and between her and her father. And the Narrator once more singeth: Lament the men of Agheyl, the men of Helal ibn Amer: Lo, there is nought of good in the world, and nought of pleasure, If that children deceive their sires, and be of the wicked. And, as they talked, behold a wise man spoke to Fadel: “Lo, the thing thy daughter hath done is known to the people, Yet is the cause of it hid. Now therefore send for thy daughter, That thou mayest know thy foeman. Let her his name discover, Since that she knoweth him thus, and thou shalt find assuagement.” And Fadel heard him speak, and all his wrath was kindled, And his mind was shaken sore, and his soul set in confusion. Yet sent he forth for Alia, and bade her appear before him. And they brought the girl to his tent, and she came to the Assembly. And he said, “What dost thou, my daughter, and what are these thy dealings, That thou betrayest thy tribe? Thou art a shame to the Arabs. They say thou knowest this man, this enemy of thy people, Ay, and didst give him the mare. Thus speak of thee the great ones.” And she answered, “Yes and yes. I know him, the adversary, And gave him, too, the mare; nor do I seek to deny it.” And Fadel's wrath grew hot, for now her guilt was proven. And he bade them bind her fast, and bring the wood for the kindling. And even so did they. And they bound her right and her left hand, And they heaped the wood, O people, even in their hour of anger, And they set a spark to the heap, even in the midst of the desert. And Alia's eyes beheld, yet bore she her fear in patience, Nor spoke she any word, nor gave reins to her terror. Said the Narrator: And when they had lit the fire, while Alia watched the kindling, behold, her fear was great, and her eyes looked to the right and to the left hand, because that Abu Zeyd had promised her that he would return to the camp; and while she was in this wise, suddenly she saw Abu Zeyd standing in the midst of the Arabs who were around her. And he was in disguisement as a dervish, or one of those who ask alms. And he saw that she was about to speak. But he signed to her that she should be silent: as it were he would say, “Fear not, for I am here.” And when she was sure that it was indeed he Abu Zeyd and none other, then smiled she on him very sweetly, and said, “Thine be the victory, and I will be thy ransom. Nor shall thy enemies prevail against thee.” But he answered with a sign, “Of a surety thou shalt see somewhat that shall astonish thee.” And this he said as the flames of the fire broke forth. Now the cause of the coming of Abu Zeyd to the place was in this wise. After that he had gone away, and had taken with him the mare, and that his mind had entered into its perplexity as to what might befall Alia from her father, lest he should seize on her and inquire what had happened, and why she had cared nothing for her own people or for her wounded brother, and why she had cried to Abu Zeyd, then said he to himself, “Of a surety I must return to her, and ascertain the event.” And looking about him, he made discovery of a cave known as yet to no man, and he placed in it the mare, and gathered grass for her, and closed the door of the cave with stones. Then clothing himself as a dervish, he made his plan how he should return to the tents of Agheyl. And forthwith he found Alia in the straits already told, and he made his thought known to her by signs, and by signs she gave him to understand her answers. And at this point the Narrator began again to sing, and it was in the following verses: So returneth my tale to the Hejazi Salameh, The hero Abu Zeyd, bearer of all men's burthens. When that these had returned, the foemen from their fighting, And she of the jewels had called aloud on his head a blessing, Then came back the hero Salameh, he grieving for Alia, Much in pain came he, and pondering his black fortune. And to himself he said, “O thou, Hejazi Salameh, Wilt thou return to thy people, or wilt thou return to Alia? I have reckoned the hour of judgment, and made account of its terrors, When all is meted to men, the good with the evil dealing.” And I counsel took with myself how I should turn me towards her, And learn the truth of her way, and how it sped with her fortune. And I feared lest evil men should stir the anger of Fadel, And pain should be her lot, and grief in the day of evil. Yet was my mind distraught for the mare, how I might dispose her, Till of a secret cave I thought, deep dug in the mountains, And there I placed her close, and grass I brought her and water, And gathered stones from the hill, and sealed the cavern with boulders, Troubled in mind, O people, and left her there and departed Uttering verses of power to hide it from eyes curious. And thus I eased my grief, and soothed my soul in its anguish. And I passed on foot through the waste by the ways my steps had trodden. And I sat alone with myself in the empty breadth of the desert, And I took from my back my wallet, and shook the dust from its leather, And loosed the buttons all, and searched its inner recesses, And took from it a dress should serve me for disguisement, Unguents and oil of salghan, and red beans and essalkam, And I roasted them on the fire till they were ripe and ruddy. And I whitened my beard with chalk, and pulled down my mustachios, And dyed my face with saffron till my cheeks glowed like apples; And I wrinkled the skin of my brows and crooked my back like a bent bow, And leaned upon my staff. For am I not, O people, A man of infinite wiles, a cunning man, a deceiver? And over the rest of my clothes I set the garb of a dervish, And held a pot in my hand, even of the pots of the beggars. And thus in my disguisement I sought his tents, the Agheyli, Troubled still in my heart for Alia and her trouble, Nor ceased I to walk and run till I came to the tents of Jaber, And found there Alia bound, with wood made red for the kindling. And she cried, “Alack-a-day! for the men of evil dealing. Call I to God above, the God of power and compassion, Him whom no eye may see, to hasten back the dark one. Ho, in what place are thy eyes, thou foolish man, Salameh, That thou comest not to her help from these which stand around her? Why dost thou leave her to these, the insolent men of evil? What didst thou say, O Abu Zeyd, when forth thou wentest? Or was thy talk a deceit to her, O Abu Mukheymer? Wert thou false and untrue, O beautiful one, O hero? If that thy speech were truth, then come thou to her succour.” And I called to her with a sign, “Nay, be not wrath in thy anger; Only the foolish are wrath.” And she answered with a gesture, “Victory be to thee, O Prince, and a life of glory; Mayest thou still of thy foes the snares outwit, the deceptions. Lo, my soul is a ransom for thine, and love I this anguish So but I know thee true, and minded not to betrayal.” And I called to her with a sign, for we needed not more language: “Traitors and evil men shall have their payment of evil. Fear not, for I am here, and, not though the fire be kindled, Be thou disturbed in mind, for lo, I stand at thy right hand; And when the flames shall rise, then look for thy deliverance.” Thus did I comfort her grief. “God make thee,” she said, “victorious.” Said the Narrator: And when Alia perceived the Emir Abu Zeyd, and when he had made himself known to her, and they had spoken each by signs to the other, so that her heart was quieted, and her mind lightened of its fear, then Abu Zeyd left her, and went on further a short space, until he came to where a holy man stood up in prayer. And he stood up with him, and made his recitation, until the Assembly was at an end. And the fire was ready kindled, and they brought Alia towards it, and they were about to place her thereon, when the Emir Abu Zeyd came near to Alia, and set aside the people who were pressing round her, and stooped down towards the fire, and having called in a loud voice upon the Prophet, he beat out the fire until it was extinguished. Then went he back to Alia and loosened her bonds, the people the while standing silent in wonder at his doing. And presently they went to the Emir Fadel and told him of what had been. And the Emir said, “Let him even do as he is minded and as it pleaseth him, for it is not meet I should set myself against any doing whatsoever of an holy man. And for the holy man's sake will I grant Alia her forgiveness. And tell her to return to her own place. But for myself need is that I go forward to greet him.” And the Emir Fadel arose quickly and approached the fakir, and he kissed his hand and said to him, “O my Lord, there hath befallen me a great and redoubtable illfortune. Make thou thy prayer for me to our Lord that He give me back my mare; for is He not the giver? And, if that thou shouldst desire to remain with us, surely there shall be to thee a fair welcome; and, shouldst thou die in this country, be assured we will make to thee a fair sepulchre whither at all hours will we come both of the night and of the day.” And when Abu Zeyd heard him say this he answered him, “Of a surety this matter shall be made clear to thee and thou shalt know the truth and behold it with thine own eyes.” Then the Emir Fadel took the fakir with him, and he made Abu Zeyd to sit in the seat of honour; nor said he aught further nor spoke more of that which had happened on the yesterday nor of the matter of the mare. And the Narrator began again to sing in the following verses; and he said: Now doth my tale return to the hero Hejazi Salameh: When that Abu Zeyd had seen the sorrow of Alia, And had said, “O Alia, trust me, trust me and be thou patient, Swift will I bring thee succour in the sight of all beholders,” Then went I for a space to the place of recitation, The place of fakirs in prayer, of holy men who were chaunting. And I found a man of God in his prayer, O people, enraptured, And around him many more who prayed in the Assembly. And I said to myself, “O Abu Zeyd Hejazi Salameh, Go thou down unto these, so shalt thou win a blessing.” And I went down to the throng and joined in the recitings, And stood as one of themselves, as one of those that are holy, I who had stolen the mare, even I to chaunt among them, And all the while my heart was as iron heated for Alia, While we recited aloud from the most noble Koran. And when we had prayed we returned. And the princess was in danger, For the people had led her forth to where the fire was enkindled, And right and left she looked if any should come with succour. Then sprang I to her side like a lion roused in his anger, And I took her by the hand, while the crowd beheld in wonder. And I thrust them back with my hands and stood beside the burning, Committing my cause to Him, the Lord God, the Almighty, And I cried out, “Burn me not, O fire, nor seek thou to shame me! Burn not, O noble fire, nor do thou hurt to my garments, For if thou work me ill, I bear to the Lord my witness, I who am nobly born, a man of illustrious lineage.” And I passed out thus through the fire, and by the Lord's permission The flames died and fell down, and I walked forth from them scathless. And I came to the side of Alia, of her with the plaited tresses, And I undid her bonds while all the world beheld us: And they said, “He is a Sheykh, a holy man of wonder.” And I said to Alia, “See, in what plight do I find thee! I have returned to thee who gavest me my asking. And lo, the flames of fire beneath thy feet extinguished. And my heart is sore for thee, and dazed my understanding: Fearful am I for thee for sake of these thy kinsmen; For thee would I destroy them with the sword's edge for ever.” But when the people saw, as all men saw, my doings, Then came they to my side and kissed they my five fingers, And they said, “O holy Sheykh, do thou procure a blessing.” And I undid Alia's bonds while all the world beheld us. Then quickly sent they forth to the Emir Agheyli Jaber, And they said, “There hath come to us a holy man, a Wely, Long bearded, untrimmed he, one rapt in contemplation, He hath quenched the flames of fire and made an end of the burning, Loosening Alia's bonds, her's of the many jewels.” And he told them, “Let him be, I have no mind to oppose him, Being of the fakirs.” And he the Sheykh came to me Barefooted, with respect, and shoeless kissed my fingers. And he bade me welcome, nobly, even to eighty welcomes. And he said, “I guess thy worth, and I will do thee honour; My heart is with the fakirs, I seek them night and morning, And I would pardon Alia were it to do thee pleasure. Yet see, one grief is mine, one all-consuming sorrow, O Sheykh, 'tis she, my mare, the fair mare which I rode on; Glorious she was to see, the envy of beholders, Light-footed—she is gone—you might say a bird's in its flying. Yet are her footsteps known to thee, thou master of wisdom.” And Abu Zeyd made answer, “In the day of hasty judgment The eyes of men are blind; wait rather till the morrow, So shall the truth be seen, and thou rejoice, O Jaber.” And he said to him, “O Sheykh, if thou wilt do me pleasure, Lodge with me here to-night, and wouldst thou tarry longer A dweller in our land, behold each night and morning To thee shall be of the best the meat that thou desirest, Garments of amber silk (and all good things in order), And if that Death should thee o'ertake within our dwelling, Lo, I will build for thee a monument of honour, And yearly make for thee a feast and celebration, And brave men at thy tomb shall keep thee in remembrance.” And the Emir Agheyli Jaber took by the hand Salameh, And brought him to his tent and set him with the great ones. And the people pressed around as it were in the market of Amer, And with them the fakir, until the dawn was breaking, While still they chaunted on, and thus to the full morning, With song and recitation and noble wealth of feasting. Said the Narrator: And when they had made the morning prayer, talking and reciting, and Abu Zeyd with them in great delight, then to them came a swift horseman, and his name was Bedr ibn Saleh er Ramal, the sand-diviner, and he came from the land of Bagdad, a knower of things hidden. And when he had alighted he sat him down with the Arabs, and the Agheyli Jaber saluted him with a fair salutation, and the man said, “O Prince of the people, the news hath reached me of the loss of thy mare, nor have I come to thee save for her sake and to discourse to thee of her welfare if thou shouldst desire it.” And the Emir said to him, “If thine be an honest business, the time favoureth.” And the Ramal struck the sand and made on it his figure fairly, and he said, “Know that he who stole the mare hath set her in a desert place, and he then came back to thee, and is now with thee beholding all thou doest, and hearing all thou sayest.” But Fadel el Agheyli said to him, “There be no strangers here save only this Sheykh and thee, thou man of contemplation.” Then the Emir Abu Zeyd went to the diviner and he said, “Know that the sand is at all times forbidden, as is spoken by the Prophet, even though the diviners should speak sooth, ‘take them as liars.’ If, therefore, thou hast other knowledge than by the sand make it known to all here.” And the diviner said, “Nay, that should be for thee rather.” And he commanded that they should bring him a stone vessel, and wine, and oil, and honey and milk, and roasted flesh, a little of each. And they brought him all that he desired. Then he took from his wallet an image of gold with names inscribed thereon, and the names were names of wonder, and the image was in the form of a son of Adam. And he placed the image in the vessel and poured on it the wine and the oil, and the honey and the milk, and all those things of which we have spoken, and he made invocations with incense, and a smoke rose. And there came to him of the Jinns crowding around him. And the image began to speak to and salute the Arabs, and tell them the story which had been told by the sand. And he said, “Know that none other hath taken the mare, save only he who is called Abu Zeyd Helali Salameh, and he is with you in this place.” And upon this the Emir sought through all the crowd, but found no man a stranger there save only Abu Zeyd and the man of contemplation. And upon this the Emir Fadel shouted to the tribesmen, and bade them “Seize hold of the two, and put them in fetters and take them to Alia, who may haply recognise the wrongdoer, and give us news of the truth of the matter.” And they did all that he bade them, and they went into the presence of Alia, and showed to her Abu Zeyd. And when she saw the Emir Abu Zeyd, she made shift to speak to him by signs. And she said, “If thou hadst obeyed me and gotten thee hence home, it had been better for thee than now.” But he said, “Fear not, for thou shalt see that of me which shall astonish thee.” And he began to recite, and rejoicing quoted verses from the book, and leaping strenuously upward burst the chains that bound him, and it seemed as though he were light as the cotton-seed which floateth in the air. And he took the chains in his hands, and broke them to pieces from his neck and wrists and ankles. And when the tribesmen saw this they went to the Emir Fadel and told him all that had happened. And he said to them, “Not for my own pleasure did I this thing, but being over-persuaded by the diviner. Bring therefore the Sheykh to me that I may beg pardon of him, but take ye the diviner, and place him in his stead in irons. And burn him with fire, and be careful that ye leave him not alive.” Said the Narrator: And upon this they obeyed and went to Bedr ibn Saleh that they might bind him. But he said to them: “O warriors, have patience until the Sheykh shall be here, and I will then show you the mare and the reason of all. And if I show you not the mare then do with me as ye list.” And they consented to his wish. Then brought they to him the Emir Abu Zeyd, and they said to Bedr, “Now is the time for thee to perform thy word, and let us see how thou wilt fare in the business.” And he answered them: “I hear and obey.” Then again he took forth the image, and he began to inquire of it what should be. And the Narrator once more singeth: Now doth my song return to the Emir Agheyli Fadel, The while he sat with his tribe at the forenoon hour, the Doha, And around him stood his people, his mighty men of valour. In pleasant talk sat they, and brave discourse of heroes, Until one came to the camp Bedr ibn Saleh the cunning, Skilled in the sand, a man of power and favoured of fortune, Bred in youth at Bagdad, his father slain by the spearpoints, Even the spears of Nathahir, and he an orphan among them. And when the tribesmen saw him, “Good luck,” said they, “attendeth.” And they cried “Salaam aleyk, O Bedr, searcher of secrets.” And Fadel too saluted, even the Emir Agheyli. And he said, “I have come, O Sultan, in doubt of the grey mare's fortune, Therefore I came from afar, from the lands of the sun's rising, Seeking to serve thy need though I journeyed west to the ocean, Or, if she eastwards be, to the furthest tribes of the Orient.” And Fadel answered fairly, “Thou cheerest me with thy coming, And this one too saith sooth, being a searcher of secrets, For he told me yesternight of thy coming and thy fortune, And the news that thou wouldst bring.” And to Abu Zeyd Salameh He said, “Thou speakest sooth, for lo, this sand-diviner The like to him is not for the sand's signs and fortunes.” And Fadel called to Bedr, “Behold me and my trouble. I will reward thee well.” And he said, “I hear in obedience.” Then drew he of the grey mare a horoscope and figure, And he saw within the lines a semblance in reversal. “An archer leadeth the mare, in the black night doth he hide her, Guised as a holy man, a man of contemplation, And he is here with you and the name of him Salameh, Hidden among you all, to Agheyl a threat and a danger.” And he turned to Abu Zeyd, “O Sheykh, give ear and hearken.” And Abu Zeyd took up the word and gave God praises: “The sand is sand,” said he, “but further hast thou nothing? If thou hast ought beside leave it no longer hidden.” But when the diviner heard this word, his ire was kindled: “The sand,” he said, “O Prince, hath spoken all things truly, It hath made known the sooth and shown the grey mare's robber; Behold he sitteth here, one of the crowd around thee, And the mare's self in a cave close shut behind thee lieth. This is a certain truth. Praise be to God the knower. Yet shall it plainer speak, so thou, O son of the great ones, Give but the word they bring stone jars with wine and honey, All that thou canst procure, with milk and meat and butter.” And they brought him all he desired, and he took from his bag an image, An image made of gold, with talismans and figures, Made in the likeness of man, with legs and arms and shoulders, And on its hand a ring, a seal-ring set with jewels. And he made the image stand in the vessel, and poured upon it Of wine and milk and honey, regarding it intently. And he covered it with a lid, and set coals in a censer, And threw thereon of incense and fragrant wood and rosin, And spake words of enchantment, and called as if entreating. And there came to him the Red One with a sound of broken thunder, Jarish, king of the Jinns, encompassed with his whirlwind, And the Princes of the Jinns in their cohorts and their legions. And a cry rose from the jar, and the image moved within it. And the Arabs beheld these things. And he breathed above the image, And made signs with a wand. And he called aloud to the image, Saying, “O image, hear me, and sooth be in thy sayings. Who was it robbed the mare and rode her forth in the night time? Nay, if thou tell me not, I will cast thee to the people.” And the image moved in the jar and rose aloft in the vessel, And called aloud to the crowd, “To all men salutation, And salutation to him, Ibn Saleh, the obedient, Him who hath sworn by the Name the Compeller of all secrets. And salutation to Fadel, the prince of Agheyl, the chieftain. Hearken to me, ye great ones. Give ear to me, O Fadel. Strange is the tale of thy mare (ay, write it in thy ledgers), For he who robbed her from thee is with thee here in Council.” And when the Emir had heard, then turned he rightwards and leftwards, Looking around in his pride like a pawn made queen on a chess-board, Yet saw he none but the Sheykh and the man of contemplation. They alone, these two, stood strange among the tribesmen. And he called aloud to the Arabs, and bade them bind them in irons, And lead them straight to Alia, to her of the plaited tresses. “For she,” he said, “shall know and tell us of our foeman.” And they took and bound Salameh and the man of contemplation, And they ringed their necks with iron and brought them bound to Alia, Crying aloud, “Behold the offenders of the great ones.” And Alia rose and came, and straightway saw Salameh, And her spirit fell in trouble, and she wept at what had fallen. And she let him know by signs known only to the dark one: “Have I not wished thee good, and victory o'er my tribesmen, When that we sat by the fire? Why didst thou not obey me When I bade thee straight begone? For lo, the grief, the trouble! Alas for thee, my people! alas for thee, Salameh! Would that my eyes had seen it not, this day of sorrow.” But he answered her with signs: “Nay, but much speech is foolish. Rail not at fortune's hand, since all, even my abasement, Is by permission of Him who knoweth the heart's secrets. Yet will I show thee a thing shall be to thee a wonder, Only do thou have patience, and wait on heaven's justice. And the hero, Abu Zeyd, vowed vows and chaunted verses, And the chains fell from his hands, as it were in handfuls of cotton. Which when the Arabs saw, they told the Agheyli Jaber. And they said, “Thou didst obey this sayer of sooth, this Bedr, And so did also we, since clear it was thy bidding. Yet what things we have seen, O Prince, what mighty wonders! For we saw the chains from his neck fall down, and the fetters sundered, As the cotton flies in the wind, when the light wind sends it driven. And now for ourselves we fear lest his wrath for us be kindled. Think of the day of account.” But Fadel, “As God pleaseth! I flout not the fakir, nor set myself with the stiff-necked. Rather take ye this other, this sayer of sooths untimely, Boaster and cheat is he. Nay, cast him straightway in fetters, And bring to me the Sheykh, that I may crave his pardon.” So they went forth for the man, the sayer of sooths untimely, And seized and bound him with bonds. But Bedr aloud protested, “Do not this deed, oh men, and be not ill in your dealings. Yet were it well, O Prince, thou shouldst ask of the Sheykh his pardon, Make him a place at thy side. And I will reveal thee all things, And show thee of the mare, and tell thee sooth of the Wely.” And when Fadel heard these words he bade them again to bring him, Saying, “Mayhap he will spare, and so my mind find comfort.” And they went again and returned and brought with them Salameh; And the holy man they brought, the man of contemplation. And to him the Agheyli rose and joyfully embraced him: Barefoot he stood and kissed his hands, the in and the outside. And he said, “O Sheykh, thy pardon I ask for that which I did thee; See, I have borne much grief, do thou forbear with my dealings, Grief on account of the mare and desolation of spirit; And, when that the image spoke, I did thee a thing unseemly, Yet, oh, the gracious dealing of him that pardoneth sinners!” And Abu Zeyd assented, “Ay, truly do I forgive thee.” And he made him sit by his side. And Jaber bade them loosen The chains of the holy man. And they sat, they three together, Making cheer and rejoicing. And all the sons of the Arabs Called to them, “Pray, O Sheykhs, we too have grace and fortune, Since of a truth we perceive that ye are the men of wonder.” Said the Narrator: And when the Sheykh had come, and the man of contemplation, and the soothsayer, and the sons of the great ones, and there had been prepared for them places in the tent, then Fadel the Agheyli turned to the soothsayer, and he said to him, “Now is the hour come for thee to show thy skill and to speak plainly, and if thou dost not speak sooth then will I slay thee and overwhelm thee with destruction.” But the soothsayer said, “I hear and obey.” Then went he once more to his image and began to upbraid it with angry words, and he swore great oaths over it, and said to it, “Verily it was no treaty I made with thee that thou shouldest lie.” And the image began again to move and to speak to Fadel and to those around him, and to tell the tale once more from the beginning, both that which was without and that which was within. And it said, “O Fadel, how hath the Prince Abu Zeyd saved thy daughter from that traitor and hath slain Sahel and Zohwa for her sake, and how did she then help him to obtain thy mare and to gain that which he desired of thee! For his is a wondrous case, and the circumstances of it how strange!” And in making an end of speaking it said, “But if thou wouldst hearken to my bidding, then wouldst thou make fellowship and friendship with him, and wouldst listen to his words and wouldst follow his counsel, nor be his adversary for ever. For to thee he were the truest of companions and of helpers. And he were of more advantage to thee than all the tribes, even than thine own Arabs.” Said the Narrator: And when the Emir Fadel heard these words of the image, then cried he with a loud voice, and his cry filled the Assembly and all the tribes heard it, and he swore a great oath and said, “Yea, verily will I, though he be the first of my foemen, that Abu Zeyd the Helali, the valiant one in fight, who slew my brethren and my kinsmen and my people.” And when he swore that oath, the Prince Abu Zeyd started to his feet and cried with a loud cry which filled the whole Assembly: “I am here, even I Salameh.” And he recited again the tale from the beginning, and all men heard and listened to the manner of his verses. And the Emir Fadel arose and pressed him to his heart, and all his trouble passed from him, and the tribesmen rejoiced at that which had come about. And thereupon the Narrator began to sing and he said: Now returneth my tale and my singing and my verses To that which him befell the Emir Agheyli Jaber. For when they had sat them down, the chiefs in the pavilion, And Abu Zeyd with them, and Fadel and Ibn Saleh: “Act,” said he, “by thy word, if thou art a man of knowledge, But if thou doest it not, know well that I shall slay thee.” And the soothsayer cried, “Ay truly, to all be there rejoicing.” And he turned him to the image with words like trickling honey, And he struck the jar with his wand and he called aloud to the image, “Wilt thou be proved a liar? And what is this thou doest? Long have we been together, and now thou wouldst me evil Shame and a bitter fortune in face of these the great ones? All thy life wert thou true to me, nor didst thou deceive me. Marvel it were to-day if thou shouldst be proved a traitor, Working thus for my death to bring me evil fortune. What have I done that thou thus shouldst stir their hatred against me? Tell me rather the truth of the mare of Agheyli Jaber, So shall his rage be stilled and he bring me forth with honour. But, if thou tellest it not, with my hand will I destroy thee, And cast thee forth to the flames to be a fuel for burning. Resolved am I on this, so be not thou of the stiff-necked. By this and by that I swear, even by the valley of Barhut.” And the image rose in its place, and it called out clear to the people, “Peace be to ye, O people, and peace to Agheyli Jaber. Listen awhile, O Fadel. The tale of thy mare is a wonder. This was its cause and reason: the ancient Lady Ghanimeh, She the mother of Amer, who went to the Helali. She came in the early morn, and found them sitting in council, Appealed to Salameh's honour, his, Abu Zeyd the Hejazi, His the lion, the dealer of blows, of wrongs the avenger. She asked of him the grey mare, and he vowed to do her bidding, Promised before them all, the great ones there with the least ones. And they heard him speak. And to him is life less dear than honour. And she said she would wait his coming with the mare, among the camp-fires. And Abu Zeyd arose and dight him for the journey, Mounted his running camel, and went from them a wanderer. And he cut a road through the void, the empty plains and the mountains, Till that he reached your land and housed within your dwellings. Clad as a poet he came and entered in disguisement. And he learned the way of you all, unknown to you, in secret. And he waited the coming of night till the dark should spread its curtain, Sitting thus in your midst with beating heart till the night time. For he is a master of wiles, perplexing with disguisements. For whiles as a Syrian he comes, and whiles as a Mogrebbin, Whiles as from Egypt's land, or a black slave, or from Berber, Or as a singer of songs from the utmost lands of the Persians. And the day he came to thy tribe, he slew Sahel Ibn Aäf, Him, O Prince, who is known to men for his deeds of evil. And with him he slew Zohwa Bint Nasser, his companion, He, the thief of thy mare, protecting thus thy daughter, Slaying the traitors twain, and dealing sure destruction. For they were together there for a foul deed in the darkness, And Abu Zeyd gave ear when they complained of thy doing, How thou hadst slain his father and seized upon his riches, And how he desired a vengeance, even on thy daughter Alia. And when that Zohwa heard him, she said, ‘I will bring her to thee.’ And to Alia's tent came she and remained with her the night through, Talking till well two-thirds of the night were spent in discourses. And afterwards she said, ‘And who is this dog of the Arabs? Is not thy father king, and lord, and sheykh of the Arabs?’ So she went with her through the night, and fate shut fast her eyelids, And when they were come to the desert, then Sahel, the dog, assailed her, Seized her strait by the throat, and clutched her necklace of jewels. And she called to him, ‘Nay, spare me.’ But he denied her pleadings. And she cried aloud to her Lord, and made her supplication. And when that she had prayed then spake she the name of Salameh, Even of Abu Zeyd, the hero, the right arm of Amer, And at her voice he came and slew those two in the darkness. And the dark one loosed her bonds and cut her bindings asunder, And bade her begone to her people and see that none should know it. And she answered him, ‘Nay truly, but first I would know thy lineage.’ And they made an oath together, and they went to the pavilion, And twenty nights and days were they two there rejoicing.” Thus then spoke the image as though it had seen and heard them. And lastly the image said, “O prince, O thou of the great ones, If thou wouldst do my bidding, let there be peace between ye.” Then was the image silent. But Fadel, “God be my witness That there is peace between us, even though he be the Helali, Abu Zeyd the destroyer, the enemy of our people. What though he slew my kin, eight men of them together, Even eight of my kin, with Zohwa Ibn Talh, and Faher, Yet may God give him peace, and may the tribes befriend him.” And Abu Zeyd arose and he spoke to the Assembly, And he cried aloud, “Behold me, Abu Zeyd of Helal Ibn Amer, I in truth was the slayer of these eight men of thy people, Taking them thus from their joy and dealing them destruction. And lo, thou art here to-day in the midst of these thy great ones, And I one man alone. Yet if thou stand indebted, Take thy due of the lion's blood and all that are with thee. Now is their time to strike. Let none hold back to spare me.” But Fadel the Agheyli spoke, and thus aloud he addressed him, “Welcome to thee, O Prince, O thou the right arm of Amer.” And he rose up and embraced him and made him sit at his right hand, And Abu Zeyd made known the hiding-place of the grey mare. And the Arabs pressed around, and the poets sang of his praises. And the heart of the Agheyli was soothed and he cried, “O right arm of Amer, Lo, thou shalt have thy wish, though thou ask my soul I will give it.” And this their story is, the true tale of their doings. VIII Said the Narrator: And when the image had done speaking and every one had listened to the story in its completeness, then believed they the words of Bedr ibn Saleh, and their hearts were comforted, and the king welcomed the Emir Abu Zeyd with the fulness of honour, and he showed favour likewise to Bedr, even to the man of contemplation, and all trouble passed from his mind. Then Abu Zeyd made known to them the place of the grey mare and they went forth and took her from the cave and made haste to feast and be merry. And after that, the Emir Fadel remained talking with the Emir Abu Zeyd for seven days, and then Abu Zeyd desired to return to his own country. Then said to him the Emir Fadel, when he had given him noble gifts and with them the mare and slaves, “What wilt thou at my hand?” And he said to him, “That which I would have of thee is Alia thy daughter.” But Fadel answered, “Ay, by the faith of the Arabs, that also is my desire and the extreme of my longings, and moreover thou shalt have with her all else whatsoever thou desirest. And here the Narrator once more singeth: Now returneth my tale to Fadel the Agheyli Jaber, And with him the hero Salameh and all that were there assembled. The Arabs heheld Ibn Saleh. And lo the Agheyli Jaber Clothed him with robes of honour and him Abu Zeyd the Helali. And they bore him a witness of glory, even all the great ones assembled. And he sat with them seven days a guest new clothed and rejoicing, And all men brought him gifts, of cloth and embroidered kaftans, And fifty steeds of the grey, and fifty steeds of the bay ones, And fifty camels the red, and fifty slaves of the black ones. But after the seventh day he said to them, “All is ended, I must away on my journey.” And Fadel, “As thou willest, Only return to our joy, and we from afar will meet thee. For 'twixt us brotherhood is, now and to our life's ending, Thou for a brother to me and I to thee for a brother.” And he said, “Be thou clear of evil, thou first of friends and of brothers. Still is there one thing left, of Alia the espousals, If she should take my hand, then were I with ye, and quickly.” And they answered all and declared “Nay, this were for our rejoicing, So should ye two remain, twin heroes with us ever.” Said the Narrator: And when the Emir Abu Zeyd desired to depart, then said to him the Emir Jaber, “Was it for the mare then that thou camest to our country, or for what else?” And Abu Zeyd related to him the whole story of the ancient dame and of all that had happened. And the Emir Fadel cried to the grooms, “Lead forth the mare, the Hamameh.” And they led her forth and brought her to the Emir Abu Zeyd. And he departed with her after that he had bidden them farewell. And he went back to those shepherds, and took from them his riding camel, and ceased not until he had returned unto his own Arabs. And when they saw him they saluted him, and came around him and rejoiced exceedingly, and they made feastings, and the tribe rejoiced. And Abu Zeyd related to them all that had happened to him, and they wondered greatly and all the tribe with them. Then sent he to the ancient dame Ghanimeh and begged of her that she might come, and when she came he delivered to her the mare and the gifts and bade her depart to her own people. But she said to him, “Nay, but send with me one who shall charge himself with my affairs.” And he sent with her Abul Komsan. And Abul Komsan went with Ghanimeh. And they had not journeyed seven days when they met with the tribe of En Naaman. And Abul Komsan went unto Naaman and said to him: “Saith my lord Abu Zeyd to thee, let Amer espouse thy daughter, for behold, the mare thou didst require of him my lord hath obtained her for thee.” But when Naaman heard that, he said, “Take the mare and return to thy Lord and say he will not listen to thy words, neither will he follow thy counsel.” But he said to him, “If thou wilt not do this thing then will I slay thee in the midst of thy Arabs, and destroy thee utterly.” But when Naaman heard this he leaped upon his mare and rushed upon Abul Komsan. But Abul Komsan struck him with his spear upon his breast and pierced him through, so that the spear shone beyond him. And he called out to all the men of the tribe, and defied them, saying, “I am your peer, and better than your peer.” But they said to him, “Nay, but thou hast done us a service, for this one refused to do according to our counsels.” So Abul Komsan bade them bury him. And they buried him. Then he bade them to bring Amer before him, and Abul Komsan made rejoicings for him and placed him upon the seat of authority in the room of his uncle Naaman. And they brought to him also Betina, the daughter of Naaman, and he ordered their marriage. And when he had done all these things he desired to leave them. But they brought him gifts and they led forth for him the mare, and he took her and his leave of them and departed, and returned to his master and told him all the story. And Abu Zeyd rejoiced and gave thanks. And the Narrator once more began his singing and he said: Saith the Agheyli Fadel the hero, “O thou, Helali, O thou man of descent, explain to me this thy coming. Was it for only this, the stealing of my grey mare, Or for some other thing thou lightedst at my dwelling?” And Abu Zeyd replied, the Hejazi Salameh: “The cause of all was this, the cause of my meeting with Alia; It was a woman bereaved, a guest of illustrious lineage. Suppliant she came to me, and made request of the grey mare, Wishing to win a bride. And I went, and all my fortune, Lo, it is known to thee. And this, O Prince, is my story.” And Fadel called to the grooms, “Lead forth,” said he, “the Hamameh, And girth her back with a saddle, a saddle crusted with jewels.” And they brought her forth in her beauty, the fair gazelle of the desert, And on her back was a saddle set of silver and jacynths, And in her mouth a silver bit with gold for her reining, And the reins of woven silk, of silk and nought else woven. And Abu Zeyd arose and saluted the Agheyli, And turned and went on his way, and with him slaves of the horsemen. And thus for seven days, till he came to his own pastures; And the men of Helal beheld him, even the horsemen of Amer. And Abu Ali Serhan made straightway a great feasting. And the dark one told his tale and all the deeds of his daring. And he sent for the ancient dame, and handed to her the grey mare, And with it the gifts and stones, and divers notable treasures. But she said, “O Abu Zeyd! O thou most worthy of honour! O thou the beautiful one, may the Lord God grant thee blessing.” And he called to Abul Komsan and bade him attend the lady: “Go with her straight,” said he, “to Naaman, and greet him, Greet him thus in my name, and all the men that are with him. Let him deliver the bride to him the son of his brother, And leave with him in her stead the mare of Agheyli Jaber. But if he yield her not and be he of the unwilling, Do thou smite off his head, else is Salameh ready.” And he said, “May but I do it and may thou live in thy glory.” And Abul Komsan went forth and with him a thousand horsemen, And they rode for seven days to Naaman and his people. And the slave dismounted with “Peace be with ye,” and told him his story. But he laughed aloud and cried, “What of the mare of Jaber? Have you the mare in your hand? the grey mare! the Hamameh!” And Abul Komsan said, “My Lord Abu Zeyd hath brought her; He hath achieved this thing, and all for the sake of Amer.” But Naaman spoke again, “And is Abu Zeyd thy master? Take thee the mare and begone, and speak to him that hath sent thee; Know that of Naaman no man yet hath claimed the obedience.” And the slave arose in his wrath, and flung himself in his saddle And roared aloud like a lion, a lion roused to the seizing, And for Naaman nought cared he, and nought for them that were with him. And Naaman called to his people, “Ho ye, the tribesmen of Dagher! Ho, to my help, O men!” But quick as the lightning flasheth, Struck the slave with his spear, and the point passed through his body, Even Naaman's body. And all men fled in confusion. But Abul Komsan cried, “Fear not. Nay, rather together Go we and bury this dog, for he died an unbeliever.” And they went with Abul Komsan and buried him as he bade them. And he sent of them for Amer and he sent of them for Betina. And the wedding feasts were spread and the days went in rejoicing. And Amer returned to his people with horses and with camels. And they said, “O Abul Komsan, lo thou art a man of honour, For thou hast slain the wicked, and we are thine, the protected, And thou hast befriended Amer. Do with us as thou desirest.” And he answered them, “O people, peace be with you, O people! Salameh is my lord, to-day and now and for ever.” And Amer brought him the mare and with it gifts and treasures, And he said, “Thou didst bring this gift. A gift of me thou shalt take her.” So he took the mare at his hand, and the gifts, and he departed; And when he came to his tribe he told Abu Zeyd the story. And Abu Zeyd gave thanks, and this is the end of their telling. Said the Narrator: And when all these things had happened and the Arabs had rejoiced, and the heart of Amer had been quieted, and he had espoused the daughter of his uncle, even Betina, and when Abul Komsan had returned to his lord with the gifts and with the grey mare, and Abu Zeyd had asked him of the news and he had told him of that which had happened, then gave Abu Zeyd thanks, and next he bethought him of the Princess Alia and of that which had been agreed between them; and he turned to his people and said to them, “I must go to Fadel the Agheyli Jaber.” And they consented thereto. So he took of his Arabs two thousand, and they journeyed until they arrived in that country. And when the horsemen of Agheyl saw him they gave him the salute of peace, and they told the Emir Fadel of the coming of the Emir Abu Zeyd. And he rose up quickly and went forth and saluted him with the salute of peace and brought him to the Divan and gave him a seat at his side. And he sat him down in comfort. And Abu Zeyd brought forward his gifts, and he restored the mare to Fadel, and Fadel's heart was cured of its sickness. And they sent for all the princes, and they wrote the contract of the marriage of Alia, and the wedding was made between Alia and Abu Zeyd. And they made a seven days' rejoicing. And Abu Zeyd remained yet a long while with them, but at the last he grew weary and longed for his own people. And he asked leave of the Agheyli that he should depart, who straightway agreed, and gave to Alia all manner of convenience and gifts for the journey. And they arose and departed, he and she together, to those their lands. And they lived thus in happiness until the end of their time. TO GOD BE PRAISE! POLITICAL POEMS THE WIND AND THE WHIRLWIND (1883) I have a thing to say. But how to say it? I have a cause to plead. But to what ears? How shall I move a world by lamentation, A world which heeded not a Nation's tears? How shall I speak of justice to the aggressors, Of right to Kings whose rights include all wrong, Of truth to Statecraft, true but in deceiving, Of peace to Prelates, pity to the Strong? Where shall I find a hearing? In high places? The voice of havock drowns the voice of good. On the throne's steps? The elders of the nation Rise in their ranks and call aloud for blood. Where? In the street? Alas for the world's reason! Not Peers not Priests alone this deed have done. The clothes of those high Hebrews stoning Stephen Were held by all of us,—ay every one. Yet none the less I speak. Nay, here by Heaven This task at least a poet best may do, To stand alone against the mighty many, To force a hearing for the weak and few. Unthanked, unhonoured,—yet a task of glory, Not in his day, but in an age more wise, When those poor Chancellors have found their portion And lie forgotten in their dust of lies. And who shall say that this year's cause of freedom Lost on the Nile has not as worthy proved Of poet's hymning as the cause which Milton Sang in his blindness or which Dante loved? The fall of Guelph beneath the spears of Valois, Freedom betrayed, the Ghibelline restored: Have we not seen it, we who caused this anguish, Exile and fear, proscription and the sword? Or shall God less avenge in their wild valley Where they lie slaughtered those poor sheep whose fold In the grey twilight of our wrath we harried To serve the worshippers of stocks and gold? This fails. That finds its hour. This fights. That falters. Greece is stamped out beneath a Wolseley's heels. Or Egypt is avenged of her long mourning, And hurls her Persians back to their own keels. 'Tis not alone the victor who is noble. 'Tis not alone the wise man who is wise. There is a voice of sorrow in all shouting, And shame pursues not only him who flies. To fight and conquer: 'tis the boast of heroes. To fight and fly: of this men do not speak. Yet shall there come a day when men shall tremble Rather than do misdeeds upon the weak, A day when statesmen baffled in their daring Shall rather fear to wield the sword in vain Than to give back their charge to a hurt nation, And own their frailties, and resign their reign, A day of wrath when all fame shall remember Of this year's work shall be the fall of one Who, standing foremost in her paths of virtue, Bent a fool's knee at War's red altar-stone, And left all virtue beggared in his falling, A sign to England of new griefs to come, Her priest of peace who sold his creed for glory And marched to carnage at the tuck of drum. Therefore I fear not. Rather let this record Stand of the past, ere God's revenge shall chase From place to punishment His sad vicegerents Of power on Earth.—I fling it in their face! I have a thing to say. But how to say it? Out of the East a twilight had been born. It was not day. Yet the long night was waning, And the spent nations watched it less forlorn. Out of the silence of the joyless ages A voice had spoken, such as the first bird Speaks to the woods, before the morning wakens, And the World starting to its feet had heard. Men hailed it as a prophecy. Its utterance Was in that tongue divine the Orient knew. It spoke of hope. Men hailed it as a brother's. It spoke of happiness. Men deemed it true. There in the land of Death, where toil is cradled, That tearful Nile, unknown to Liberty, It spoke in passionate tones of human freedom, And of those rights of Man which cannot die, Till from the cavern of long fear, whose portals Had backward rolled, and hardly yet aloud, Men prisoned stole like ghosts and joined the chorus, And chaunted trembling, each man in his shroud: Justice and peace, the brotherhood of nations, Love and goodwill of all mankind to man: These were the words they caught and echoed strangely, Deeming them portions of some Godlike plan, A plan thus first to their own land imparted. They did not know the irony of Fate, The mockery of man's freedom, and the laughter Which greets a brother's love from those that hate. Oh for the beauty of hope's dreams! The childhood Of that old land, long impotent in pain, Cast off its slough of sorrow with its silence, And laughed and shouted and grew new again. And in the streets, where still the shade of Pharaoh Stalked in his sons, the Mamelukian horde, Youth greeted youth with words of exultation And shook his chains and clutched as for a sword: Student and merchant, Jew, and Copt, and Moslem, All whose scarred backs had bent to the same rod, Fired with one mighty thought, their feuds forgotten, Stood hand in hand and praising the same God. I have a thing to say. But how to say it? As in the days of Moses in the land, God sent a man of prayer before his people To speak to Pharaoh, and to loose his hand. Injustice, that hard step-mother of heroes, Had taught him justice. Him the sight of pain Moved unto anger, and the voice of weeping Made his eyes weep as for a comrade slain. A soldier in the bands of his proud masters It was his lot to serve. But of his soul None owned allegiance save the Lord of Armies. No worship from his God's might him cajole. Strict was his service. In the law of Heaven He comfort took and patience under wrong. And all men loved him for his heart unquailing, And for the words of pity on his tongue. Knowledge had come to him in the night-watches, And strength with fasting, eloquence with prayer. He stood a Judge from God before the strangers, The one just man among his people there. Strongly he spoke: “Now, Heaven be our witness! Egypt this day has risen from her sleep. She has put off her mourning and her silence. It was no law of God that she should weep. “It was no law of God nor of the Nations That in this land, alone of the fair Earth, The hand that sowed should reap not of its labour, The heart that grieved should profit not of mirth. “How have we suffered at the hands of strangers, Binding their sheaves, and harvesting their wrath! Our service has been bitter, and our wages Hunger and pain and nakedness and drouth. “Which of them pitied us? Of all our princes, Was there one Sultan listened to our cry? Their palaces we built, their tombs, their temples. What did they build but tombs for Liberty? “To live in ignorance, to die by service, To pay our tribute and our stripes receive: This was the ransom of our toil in Eden, This, and our one sad liberty—to grieve. “We have had enough of strangers and of princes Nursed on our knees and lords within our house. The bread which they have eaten was our children's, For them the feasting and the shame for us. “The shadow of their palaces, fair dwellings Built with our blood and kneaded with our tears, Darkens the land with darkness of Gehennem, The lust, the crime, the infamy of years. “Did ye not hear it? From those muffled windows A sound of women rises and of mirth. These are our daughters—ay our sons—in prison, Captives to shame with those who rule the Earth. “The silent river, by those gardens lapping, To-night receives its burden of new dead, A man of age sent home with his lord's wages, Stones to his feet, a grave-cloth to his head. “Walls infamous in beauty, gardens fragrant With rose and citron and the scent of blood. God shall blot out the memory of all laughter, Rather than leave you standing where you stood. “We have had enough of princes and of strangers, Slaves that were Sultans, eunuchs that were kings, The shame of Sodom is on all their faces. The curse of Cain pursues them, and it clings. “Is there no virtue? See the pale Greek smiling. Virtue for him is as a tale of old. Which be his gods? The cent per cent in silver. His God of gods? The world's creator, Gold. “The Turk that plunders and the Frank that panders, These are our lords who ply with lust and fraud. The brothel and the winepress and the dancers Are gifts unneeded in the lands of God. “We need them not. We heed them not. Our faces Are turned to a new Kebla, a new truth, Proclaimed by the one God of all the nations To save His people and renew their youth. “A truth which is of knowledge and of reason; Which teaches men to mourn no more and live; Which tells them of things good as well as evil, And gives what Liberty alone can give, “The counsel to be strong, the will to conquer, The love of all things just and kind and wise, Freedom for slaves, fair rights for all as brothers, The triumph of things true, the scorn of lies. “O men, who are my brethren, my soul's kindred! That which our fathers dreamed of as a dream, The sun of peace, and justice, has arisen, And God shall work in you His perfect scheme. “The rulers of your Earth shall cease deceiving, The men of usury shall fly your land. Your princes shall be numbered with your servants, And peace shall guide the sword in your right hand. “You shall become a nation with the nations. Lift up your voices, for the night is past. Stretch forth your hands. The hands of the free peoples Have beckoned you the youngest and the last. “And in the brotherhood of Man reposing, Joined to their hopes and nursed in their new day, The anguish of the years shall be forgotten And God, with these, shall wipe your tears away.” I have a thing to say. But how to say it? How shall I tell the mystery of guile, The fraud that fought, the treason that disbanded, The gold that slew the children of the Nile? The ways of violence are hard to reckon, And men of right grow feeble in their will, And Virtue of her sons has been forsaken, And men of peace have turned aside to kill. How shall I speak of them, the priests of Baal, The men who sowed the wind for their ill ends! The reapers of the whirlwind in that harvest Were all my countrymen, were some my friends. Friends, countrymen and lovers of fair freedom, Souls to whom still my soul laments and cries! I would not tell the shame of your false dealings, Save for the blood which clamours to the skies. A curse on Statecraft, not on you, my Country! The men you slew were not more foully slain Than was your honour at their hands you trusted. They died, you conquered,—both alike in vain. Crimes find accomplices, and Murder weapons. The ways of Statesmen are an easy road. All swords are theirs, the noblest with the neediest. And those who serve them best are men of good. What need to blush, to trifle with dissembling? A score of honest tongues anon shall swear. Blood flows. The Senate's self shall spread its mantle In the world's face, nor own a Cæsar there. “Silence! Who spoke?” “The voice of one disclosing A truth untimely.” “With what right to speak? Holds he the Queen's commission?” “No, God's only.” A hundred hands shall smite him on the cheek. The “truth” of Statesmen is the thing they publish, Their “falsehood” the thing done they do not say, Their “honour” what they win from the world's trouble, Their “shame” the “ay” which reasons with their “nay.” Alas for Liberty, alas for Egypt! What chance was yours in this ignoble strife? Scorned and betrayed, dishonoured and rejected, What was there left you but to fight for life? The men of honour sold you to dishonour. The men of truth betrayed you with a kiss. Your strategy of love too soon outplotted, What was there left you of your dreams but this? You thought to win a world by your fair dealing, To conquer freedom with no drop of blood. This was your crime. The world knows no such reasoning. It neither bore with you nor understood. Your Pharaoh with his chariots and his dancers, Him they could understand as of their kin. He spoke in their own tongue and as their servant, And owned no virtue they could call a sin. They took him for his pleasure and their purpose. They fashioned him as clay to their own pride. His name they made a cudgel to your hurting, His treachery a spear-point to your side. They knew him, and they scorned him and upheld him. They strengthened him with honours and with ships. They used him as a shadow for seditions. They stabbed you with the lying of his lips. Sad Egypt! Since that night of misadventure Which slew your first-born for your Pharaoh's crime, No plague like this has God decreed against you, No punishment of all foredoomed in Time. I have a thing to say. Oh how to say it! One summer morning, at the hour of prayer, And in the face of Man and Man's high Maker, The thunder of their cannon rent the air. The flames of death were on you and destruction. A hail of iron on your heads they poured. You fought, you fell, you died until the sunset; And then you fled forsaken of the Lord. I care not if you fled. What men call courage Is the least noble thing of which they boast. Their victors always are great men of valour. Find me the valour of the beaten host! It may be you were cowards. Let them prove it,— What matter? Were you women in the fight, Your courage were the greater that a moment You steeled your weakness in the cause of right. Oh I would rather fly with the first craven Who flung his arms away in your good cause, Than head the hottest charge by England vaunted In all the record of her unjust wars! Poor sheep! they scattered you. Poor slaves! they bowed you. You prayed for your dear lives with your mute hands. They answered you with laughter and with shouting, And slew you in your thousands on the sands. They led you with arms bound to your betrayer: His slaves, they said, recaptured for his will. They bade him to take heart and fill his vengeance. They gave him his lost sword that he might kill. They filled for him his dungeons with your children. They chartered him new gaolers from strange shores: The Arnaout and the Cherkess for his minions, Their soldiers for the sentries at his doors. He plied you with the whip, the rope, the thumb-screw. They plied you with the scourging of vain words. He sent his slaves, his eunuchs, to insult you. They sent you laughter on the lips of Lords. They bound you to the pillar of their firmans. They placed for sceptre in your hand a pen. They cast lots for the garments of your treaties, And brought you naked to the gaze of men. They called on your High Priest for your death mandate. They framed indictments on you from your laws. For him men loved they offered a Barabbas. They washed their hands and found you without cause. They scoffed at you and pointed in derision, Crowned with their thorns and nailed upon their tree. And at your head their Pilate wrote the inscription: “This is the land restored to Liberty!” Oh insolence of strength! Oh boast of wisdom! Oh poverty in all things truly wise! Thinkest thou, England, God can be outwitted For ever thus by him who sells and buys? Thou sellest the sad nations to their ruin. What hast thou bought? The child within the womb, The son of him thou slayest to thy hurting, Shall answer thee, “An Empire for thy tomb.” Thou hast joined house to house for thy perdition. Thou hast done evil in the name of right. Thou hast made bitter sweet and the sweet bitter, And called light darkness and the darkness light. Thou art become a by-word for dissembling, A beacon to thy neighbours for all fraud. Thy deeds of violence men count and reckon. Who takes the sword shall perish by the sword. Thou hast deserved men's hatred. They shall hate thee. Thou hast deserved men's fear. Their fear shall kill. Thou hast thy foot upon the weak. The weakest With his bruised head shall strike thee on the heel. Thou wentest to this Egypt for thy pleasure. Thou shalt remain with her for thy sore pain. Thou hast possessed her beauty. Thou wouldst leave her. Nay. Thou shalt lie with her as thou hast lain. She shall bring shame upon thy face with all men. She shall disease thee with her grief and fear. Thou shalt grow sick and feeble in her ruin. Thou shalt repay her to the last sad tear. Her kindred shall surround thee with strange clamours, Dogging thy steps till thou shalt loathe their din. The friends thou hast deceived shall watch in anger. Thy children shall upbraid thee with thy sin. All shall be counted thee a crime,—thy patience With thy impatience. Thy best thought shall wound. Thou shalt grow weary of thy work thus fashioned, And walk in fear with eyes upon the ground. The Empire thou didst build shall be divided. Thou shalt be weighed in thine own balances Of usury to peoples and to princes, And be found wanting by the world and these. They shall possess the lands by thee forsaken And not regret thee. On their seas no more Thy ships shall bear destruction to the nations, Or thy guns thunder on a fenceless shore. Thou hadst no pity in thy day of triumph. These shall not pity thee. The world shall move On its high course and leave thee to thy silence, Scorned by the creatures that thou couldst not love. Thy Empire shall be parted, and thy kingdom. At thy own doors a kingdom shall arise, Where freedom shall be preached and the wrong righted Which thy unwisdom wrought in days unwise. Truth yet shall triumph in a world of justice. This is of faith. I swear it. East and west The law of Man's progression shall accomplish Even this last great marvel with the rest. Thou wouldst not further it. Thou canst not hinder. If thou shalt learn in time, thou yet shalt live. But God shall ease thy hand of its dominion, And give to these the rights thou wouldst not give. The nations of the East have left their childhood. Thou art grown old. Their manhood is to come; And they shall carry on Earth's high tradition Through the long ages when thy lips are dumb, Till all shall be wrought out. O Lands of weeping, Lands watered by the rivers of old Time, Ganges and Indus and the streams of Eden, Yours is the future of the world's sublime. Yours was the fount of man's first inspiration, The well of wisdom whence he earliest drew. And yours shall be the flood-time of his reason, The stream of strength which shall his strength renew. The wisdom of the West is but a madness, The fret of shallow waters in their bed. Yours is the flow, the fulness of Man's patience The ocean of God's rest inherited. And thou too, Egypt, mourner of the nations, Though thou hast died to-day in all men's sight, And though upon thy cross with thieves thou hangest, Yet shall thy wrong be justified in right. ’Twas meet one man should die for the whole people. Thou wert the victim chosen to retrieve The sorrows of the Earth with full deliverance. And, as thou diest, these shall surely live. Thy prophets have been scattered through the cities. The seed of martyrdom thy sons have sown Shall make of thee a glory and a witness In all men's hearts held captive with thine own. Thou shalt not be forsaken in thy children. Thy righteous blood shall fructify the Earth. The virtuous of all lands shall be thy kindred, And death shall be to thee a better birth. Therefore I do not grieve. Oh hear me, Egypt! Even in death thou art not wholly dead. And hear me, England! Nay. Thou needs must hear me. I had a thing to say. And it is said. THE CANON OF AUGHRIM (1888) You ask me of English honour, whether your Nation is just? Justice for us is a word divine, a name we revere, Alas, no more than a name, a thing laid by in the dust. The world shall know it again, but not in this month or year. Honour? Oh no, you profane it. Justice? What words! What deeds! Look at the suppliant Earth with its living burden of men. Here and to Hindostan the nations and kings and creeds Praise your name as a god's, the god of their children slain. Which of us doubts your justice? It is not here in the West, After six hundred years of pitiless legal war, The sons of our soil are in doubt. They know, who have borne it, best: The world is famished for justice. You give us a stone, your law. These are its fruits. Yet, think you, the Ireland where men weep Once was a jubilant land and dear to the Saints of God. All you have made it to-day is a hell to conquer and keep, Yours by the right of the strongest hand, the right of the rod. History tells the story in signs deep writ on the soil, Plain and clear in indelible type both for fools and wise. Here is no need of books, of any expositor's coil. He who runs may read, and he may weep who has eyes. This is the plain of Aughrim, renowned in our Irish story Because of the blood that was shed, the last in arms by our sons, A fight in battle array, with more of grief than of glory, Where as a Nation we died to dirge of your English guns. So the Chroniclers tell us, and turn in silence their page, Ending the fighting here. I tell you the Chroniclers lie. Spite of the hush of the dead, the battle from age to age Flames on still through the land, and still at men's hands men die. Look! I will show you the footsteps of those who have died at your hand, Done to death by your law, alas, and not by the sword, Only their work remaining, a nations's track in the sand, Ridge and furrow of ancient fields half hid in the sward. Step by step they retreated. You fenced them out with your Pale, Back from township and city and cornland fair by the Sea. Waterford, Youghal and Wexford you took and the Golden Vale. Tears were their portion assigned: for you their demesnes in fee. Back to the forest and bog. They shouldered their spades like men, Fought with the wolf and the rock and the hunger which holds the hill. Still new homesteads arose where fever lurked in the fen, Still your law was a sword that hunted and dogged them still. Magistrate, landlord, bailiff, process-server and spy, These were the dogs of your pack, which scented the land's increase. Vainly, like hares, they lay in the forms they had fashioned to die. Justice hunted them forth by the hand of the Justice of Peace. Look at it closer, thus, and shading your eyes with your hand, Far as a bird could reach, to the utmost edge of the plain, What do you see but grass! And what do you understand? Cattle that graze on the grass.—Alas, you have looked in vain. See with my eyes. They are older than yours, but more keen in their love. See what I saw as a boy in the fields, as a priest by the ways. See what I saw in anger with angels watching above Hiding their faces for shame in the day of the terrible days. Horsemen and footmen and guns. They were here. I have seen them, though some Say that two hundred years have passed since the battle was stilled. Ay, and the cry of the wounded, drowned by the beat of the drum. Did I not hear with my ears how it rose like the wail of a child? I was a student then, a boy, in the days now forgotten, When for our school-house the chapel must serve, for our master the priest. Many a Latin theme have I scrawled on the altar rails rotten, Thinking no more of the house of God than the house of the least. Yet we were saints in Aughrim. An Eden the plain then stood, Covered with gardens round, a happy and holy place, Rich in the generations of those who had shed their blood, Bound to their faith by the martyr's bond and the power of grace. They do us wrong who affirm the Irish people are sad. Sad we are in the lands afar, but not in our home. Oh, if you knew the gladness with which our people are glad, Well might you grieve for your own, the poor in your towns of doom. Here, God knows it, we hunger. But hunger, a little, is well, Man with full stomach is proud, his heart is shut to the poor. Well, too, is persecution, since thus through its sting we rebel, Clinging yet more to our love and our hate in the homes we adore. Mine is a mission of peace, to save men's souls in the world, Not to make converts to Hell, for Ireland's sake even, you say. Why should I preach of rebellion, and hatred, words impotent hurled Each like a spear from the lips to strike whom it lists in the fray? Hark. You shall hear it. This parish was mine. I remember it all Tilled in squares, like a chess-board, each house and holding apart. Down where the nettles grow you may mark the line of the wall Bounding the chapel field where our dead lie heart on heart. It was not the famine killed them. God knows in that evil year He pressed us a little hard, but he spared us our lives and joy. Only the old and weak were taken. The rest stood clear, Quit of their debt to Death. God struck, but not to destroy. The wolves of the world were fiercer. The wolves of the world to-day Go in sheep's clothing all, with names that the world applauds. Nobody now draws sword or spear with intent to slay. Death is done with a sigh, and mercy tightens the cords. It was a woman did it. Her father, the lawyer Blake, Purchased the land for a song,—some say, or less, for a debt Owed by the former Lord, a broken spendthrift and rake— And left it hers when he died with all he could grip or get. Timothy Blake was not loved. He had too much in his heart Of the law of tenures, for love. No word men spoke in his praise. Yet, in his lawyer's way, and deeds and titles apart, All were allowed to live who paid their rent in his days. Little Miss Blake was his daughter. A pink-faced school-girl she came First from Dublin city to live in her father's house, She and her dogs and horses, unconscious of shame or blame. Who would have guessed her cruel with manners meek as a mouse? Nothing in truth was further, or further seemed, from her heart, Set as it was on pleasure and undisturbed with pain, So she might ride with the hounds when winter brought round its sport, Or angle a trout from the river, than war with her fellow men. She was fastidious, too, with her English education, And pained at want and squalor, things hard she should understand. The sight of poverty touched the sense of what was due to her station, And still in her earlier years she gave with an open hand. The village was poor to look at, a row of houses, no more, With just four walls and the thatch in holes where the fowls passed through. A shame to us all, she averred, and her, so near to her door, She sent us for slates to the quarry and bade us build them anew. The Chapel, too, was unsightly. A Protestant she, and yet Decency needs must be in a house of prayer, she said. Perched on a rising ground in sight of her windows set, Its shapeless walls were her grief. She built it a new facade. What was it changed her heart? God knows. I know not. Some say She set her fancy on one above her in rank and pride. Young Lord Clair at the Castle had danced with her. Then one day Dancing and she were at odds. He had taken an English bride. This, or it may be less, a foolish word from a friend, A jest repeated to ears already wounded and sore, A pang of jealousy roused for the sake of some private end, Or only the greed of gain, of more begotten of more. These were the days of plenty, of prices rising, men thought Still to rise for ever, and all were eager to buy. Landlord with landlord vied, and tenant with tenant bought. Riches make selfish souls, and gain has an evil eye. Oh! the economist fraud, with wealth of nations for text, How has it robbed the poor of their one poor right to live! Only the fields grow fat. The men that delve them are vexed, Scourged with the horse-leech cry of the daughter of hunger, “give.” Why should I blame this woman? She practised what all men preach, Duty to Man a little, but much to herself and land. She made two blades of grass to grow in the place of each. She took two guineas for one. What more would your laws demand? If in her way men died, Economy's rules are stern, Stern as the floods and droughts, the tempests and fires and seas. Men but cumber the land whose labour is weak to earn More than their board and bed; much cattle were worthy these. So those argued who served her. What wonder if she too grew Hard in her dealings around, and grudged their lands to the poor? Cary, her agent, died. The day she engaged the new, Grief stepped into the village, and Death sat down at the door. Rent? Who speaks of the rent? We Irish who till the soil, Are ever ready to pay the tribute your laws impose; You, the conquering race, have portioned to each his toil; We, the conquered, bring the ransom due to our woes. Here is no case of justice, of just debts made or unjust. Contracts 'twixt freemen are, not here, where but one is free. No man argues of right, who pays the toll that he must; Life is dear to all, and rent is the leave to be. No. None argued of rent. Each paid, or he could not pay, Much as the seasons willed, in fatness or hungry years. Blake's old rental was high. She raised it, and none said nay; Then she raised it again, and made a claim for arrears. Joyce was her agent now. The rules of Charity bind Somewhat my tongue in speech, for even truths wrongs endured; All I will say is this, in Joyce you might see combined, Three worst things, a lawyer, money-lender, and steward. His was the triple method, to harass by legal plan, Ruin by note of hand, and serve with the Crown's decree; One by one in his snare he trapped the poor to a man, Left them bare in the street, and turned in their doors the key. How many Christian hearts have I seen thus flouted with scorn, Turned adrift on the world in the prime of life and their pride! How many lips have I heard curse out the day they were born, Souls absolved in their anger to die on the bare hill-side! All for Miss Blake and the law, and Joyce's profit on fees! All for Imperial order, to see the Queen's writ run! All for the honour of England, mistress of half the seas! All in the name of justice, the purest under the sun! Pitiful God of justice! You speak of order and law? Order! the law of blood which sets the stoat on the track; Law! the order of death which has glutted the soldier's maw, When Hell lies drunk in a city the morning after a sack. Order and law and justice! All noble things, but defiled, Made to stink in men's nostrils, a carrion refuse of good, Till God Himself is debased in the work of His hands beguiled, And good and bad are as one in the mind of the multitude. All in vain we argue who preach submission to Heaven. Even to us who know it, such mercy is hard to find. How then submission to Man by whom no quarter is given? Vainly and thrice in vain. That nut has too hard a rind. Then men rise in their anger. Another justice they seek. Maxims of right prevail traced down from a pagan age; These take the place of the gospel your laws have robbed from the weak. Who shall convince them of wrong, or turn the worm from his rage? Which are the first fruits of freedom? Truth, Courage, Compassion. A man, Nursed from his childhood in right and guarded close by the law, Why should he trifle with virtue or doubt to do what he can Fearless in sight of the world, his life without failure or flaw? All things come to the strong, power, riches, fair living, repute, Conscience of worth and of virtue, plain speaking and dealing as plain. Oh, fair words are easy to speak when the world spreads its pearls at your foot. Free is humanity's fetter with pleasure gilding the chain. The Englishman's word, who shall doubt it? The poor Celt, truly, he lies. Fie on his houghing of cattle, his blunderbuss fired from the hedge! Witness swears falsely to murder. You throw up your innocent eyes, Rightly, for murder and lying set honest teeth upon edge. Yet, mark how circumstance alters. You plant your Englishman down Strange on the banks of the Nile or Niger to shift with new life. All things are stronger than he. He fears men's fanatic frown, Straightway fawns at their knees, his fingers clutching the knife. He is kindly. Yet, think you he spares them, the servant, the cattle, the child, The wife he has wedded in falsehood, the Prince who clothed him in gold? Out on such womanly scruples! He boasts the friends he beguiled, The poisoned wells on his track, the poor slaves starved on the wold. This is necessity's law? Ay, truly. Necessity teaches Sternly the Devil's truth, and he that hath ears may hear. Only the grace of God interprets the wrong Hell preaches. Only the patience of perfect love can cast out fear. Joyce was found on his doorstep, stone dead, one Sunday morning, Shot by an unknown hand, a charge of slugs in his chest, The blow had fallen unheard, without either sign or warning, Save for the notice-to-quit pinned to the dead man's breast. Oh, that terrible morning of grief to angels and men! I who knew, none better, the truth that until that day Sin in its larger sense was hardly within the ken Of these poor peasant souls, what dared I devise or say? A deed of terror? Yes. A murder? Yes. A foul crime? True, but a signal of battle, the first blood spilt in a war. Who could foresee the sequence of wrong to the end of time? Who would listen to peace with the red flag waving afar? War, war, war, was the issue in all men's minds as they stood Watching the constable force paraded that afternoon, War of the ancient sort when men lay wait in a wood Spying the Norman camps low crouched in a waning moon. Group with group they whispered. Their eyes looked strangely and new, Lit with the guilty knowledge as thoughts of the dead would pass. It was a pitiful sight to mark how the anger grew In souls that had prayed as children that very morning at Mass. The answer to Joyce's murder was swift. Two strokes of the pen, Set by Miss Blake's fair hand on parchment white as her face, Gave what remained of the parish, lands, tenements, chapel, and mill, All to a Scotch stock farmer to hold on a single lease. Here stands the story written. The parchment itself could show Hardly more of their death than this great desolate plain. The poor potato trenches they dug, how greenly they grow! Grass, all grass for ever, the graves of our women and men! And did all die? You ask it. I ask you in turn, “What is death?” Death by disease or battle, with gaping wounds for a door: Through it the prisoned soul runs forth with the prisoned breath, And what is lost for the one the other gains it and more: This is the death of the body. Some died thus, fortunate ones, Here and there a woman taken in labour of birth, Here and there a man struck down on his cold hearth stones, Here and there a child, or grey beard bent to the earth. Heaven in pity took them. Their innocent souls received All that the Church can give of help on the onward way. Here as they lived they died, believing all they believed. Here their bodies rest, clay kneaded with kindred clay. Every eviction in Ireland brings one such physical loss, Weak ones left by the road, grief touching the feeble brain. None of us mourn such dead who hold the creed of the Cross, Counting as sure their certain hope of eternal gain. Not for these is my anger. Love grieves, but the cicatrice closes, Ending in peace of heart. The dead are doubly our own. But what of that other death for which love strews no roses, Death of the altered soul, lost, perished, forever gone? Deep in the gulf of your cities they lie, the poor lorn creatures, Made in God's image once, His folded innocent sheep, Now misused and profaned, in speech and form and features Living like devils and dying like dogs in incestuous sleep. Seek them where I have found them, in New York, Liverpool, London, Cursing and cursed of all, a pustulous human growth, These same Irish children God made for His glory, undone, Ay, and undoing your law, while black Hell gapes for you both. There! You asked for the truth. You have it plain from my lips. Scientists tell us the world has no direction or plan, Only a struggle of Nature, each beast and nation at grips, Still the fittest surviving and he the fittest who can. You are that fittest, the lion to-day in your strength. To-morrow? Well, who knows what other will come with a wider jaw? Justly, you say, the nations give place and yield in their sorrow; Vainly, you say, Christ died in face of the natural law. Would you have me believe it? I tell you, if it were so, If I were not what I am, a priest instructed in grace, Knowing the truth of the Gospel and holding firm what I know, Where should I be at this hour? Nay, surely not in this place. Granted your creed of destruction, your right of the strong to devour, Granted your law of Nature that he shall live who can kill, Find me the law of submission shall stay the weak in his hour, His single hour of vengeance, or set a rein on his will. Where should I be, even I? Not surely here with my tears, Weeping an old man's grief at wrongs which are past regret, Healing here a little and helping there with my prayers, All for the sake of Nature, to fill the teeth she has whet! Not a priest at Aughrim. My place would be down with those Poor lost souls of Ireland, who, loving her far away, Not too wisely but well, deep down in your docks lie close, Waiting the night of ruin which needs must follow your day. England's lion is fat. Full-bellied with fortune he sleeps; Why disturb his slumber with ominous news of ill? Softly from under his paw the prey he has mangled creeps, Deals his blow in the back, and all the carcase is still. Logic and counter-logic. You talk of cowardice rarely! Dynamite under your ships might make even your cheek white. Treacherous? Oh, you are jesting. The natural law works fairly, He that has cunning shall live, and he that has poison bite. Only I dare not believe it. I hold the justice of Heaven Larger than all the science, and welled from a purer fount; God as greater than Nature, His law than the wonders seven, Darwin's sermon on Man redeemed by that on the Mount. Thus spoke the Canon of Aughrim, and raised in silence his hands, Seeming to bless the battle his eyes had seen on the plain. Order and law, he murmured, a Nation's track in the sands, Ridge and furrow of grass, the graves of our women and men. SATAN ABSOLVED A Victorian Mystery (1899) (In the antechamber of Heaven. Satan walks alone. Angels in groups conversing.) Satan. To-day is the Lord's “day.” Once more on His good pleasure I, the Heresiarch, wait and pace these halls at leisure Among the Orthodox, the unfallen Sons of God. How sweet in truth Heaven is, its floors of sandal wood, Its old-world furniture, its linen long in press, Its incense, mummeries, flowers, its scent of holiness! Each house has its own smell. The smell of Heaven to me Intoxicates and haunts,—and hurts. Who would not be God's liveried servant here, the slave of His behest, Rather than reign outside? I like good things the best, Fair things, things innocent; and gladly, if He willed, Would enter His Saints' kingdom—even as a little child. [Laughs. I have come to make my peace, to crave a full amaun, Peace, pardon, reconcilement, truce to our daggers-drawn, Which have so long distraught the fair wise Universe, An end to my rebellion and the mortal curse Of always evil-doing. He will mayhap agree I was less wholly wrong about Humanity The day I dared to warn His wisdom of that flaw. It was at least the truth, the whole truth, I foresaw When He must needs create that simian “in His own Image and likeness.” Faugh! the unseemly carrion! I claim a new revision and with proofs in hand, No Job now in my path to foil me and withstand. Oh, I will serve Him well! [Certain Angels approach. But who are these that come With their grieved faces pale and eyes of martyrdom? Not our good Sons of God? They stop, gesticulate, Argue apart, some weep,—weep, here within Heaven's gate! Sob almost in God's sight! ay, real salt human tears, Such as no Spirit wept these thrice three thousand years. The last shed were my own, that night of reprobation When I unsheathed my sword and headed the lost nation. Since then not one of them has spoken above his breath Or whispered in these courts one word of life or death Displeasing to the Lord. No Seraph of them all, Save I this day each year, has dared to cross Heaven's hall And give voice to ill news, an unwelcome truth to Him. Not Michael's self hath dared, prince of the Seraphim. Yet all now wail aloud.—What ails ye, brethren? Speak! Are ye too in rebellion? Angels. Satan, no. But weak With our long earthly toil, the unthankful care of Man. Satan. Ye have in truth good cause. Angels. And we would know God's plan, His true thought for the world, the wherefore and the why Of His long patience mocked, His name in jeopardy. We have no heart to serve without instructions new. Satan. Ye have made a late discovery. Angels. There is no rain, no dew, No watering of God's grace that can make green Man's heart, Or draw him nearer Heaven to play a godlier part. Our service has grown vain. We have no rest nor sleep; The Earth's cry is too loud. Satan. Ye have all cause to weep Since you depend on Man. I told it and foretold. Angels. Truly thou didst. Satan. Dear fools! But have ye heart to hold Such plaint before the Lord, to apprise Him of this thing In its full naked fact and call your reckoning? Angels. We dare not face His frown. He lives in ignorance. His pride is in His Earth. If He but looks askance We tremble and grow dumb. Satan. And ye will bear it then? Angels. We dare not grieve His peace. He loves this race of men. Satan. The truth should hardly grieve. Angels. He would count it us for pride. He holds Mankind redeemed, since His Son stooped and died. We dare not venture. Satan. See, I have less than you to lose. Give me your brief. Angels. Ay, speak. Thee He will not refuse. Mayhap thou shalt persuade Him. Satan. And withal find grace. The Lord is a just God. He will rejudge this case, Ay, haply, even mine. O glorious occasion! To champion Heaven's whole right without shift or evasion And plead the Angels' cause! Take courage, my sad heart, Thine hour hath come to thee, to play this worthiest part And prove thy right, thine too, to Heaven's moralities, Not worse than these that wait, only alas more wise! Angels. Hush! Silence! The Lord God! (Entereth the Lord God, to whom the Angels minister. He taketh His seat upon the throne.) The Lord God. Thank ye, My servants all. Thank ye, good Seraphim. To all and several, Sons of the House, God's blessing (aside) who ne'er gave God pain. Impeccable white Spirits, tell Me once again How goeth it with the World, My ordered Universe, My Powers and Dominations? Michael, thou, rehearse The glory of the Heavens. Tell Me, star and star, Do they still sing together in their spheres afar? Have they their speech, their language? Are their voices heard? Michael. All's well with the World. Each morn, as bird to answering bird, The Stars shout in Thy glory praise unchanged yet new. They magnify Thy name. The Lord God. Truth's self were else untrue. Time needs be optimist nor foul its own abode. Else were Creation mocked (aside)and haply I not God. In sooth all's well with the World. And thou My Raphael, How fare the Spirit hosts? Say, is thy world, too, well? Raphael. All's well with the World. We stand, as aye, obedient. We have no thought but Thee, no asking, no intent More than to laud and worship, O most merciful, Being of those that wait. Satan (aside). The contemplative rule Out-ministers the active. These have right to boast, Who stand aye in His presence, beyond the Angel host. The Lord God. And none of ye grow weary? Raphael. Nay in truth. The Lord God. Not one? Satan (aside). God is a jealous God. He doubteth them. Raphael. Nay, none. We are not as the Angels. The Lord God. These have their devoirs, The search, the novelty. Ye drowse here in your choirs, Sleep-walkers all,—while these, glad messengers, go forth Upon new joyous errands, Earthwards, South and North, To visit men and cities. What is strange as Man? What fair as his green Globe in all Creation's plan? What ordered as his march of life, of mind, of will? What subtle as his conscience set at grips with ill? Their service needs no sleep who guide Man's destinies! (After a pause). Speak, Gabriel, thou the last. Is Man grown grand andwise? Hath he his place on Earth, prince of Time's fashionings, Noblest and fairest found, the roof and crown of things? Is the World joyful all in his most perfect joy? Hath the good triumphed, tell, o'er pain and Time's annoy, Since Our Son died, who taught the way of perfect peace? Thou knowest it how I love these dear Humanities. Is all quite well with Man? Gabriel. All's well with the World, ay well. All's well enough with Man. Satan (aside). Alas, poor Gabriel. The Lord God. How meanest thou “enough”? Man holdeth then Earth's seat, Master of living things. He mild is and discreet, Supreme in My Son's peace. The Earth is comforted With its long rest from toil, nor goeth aught in dread, Seeing all wars have ceased, the mad wars of old time. The lion and the lamb lie down in every clime. There is no strife for gold, for place, for dignities, All holding My Son's creed! The last fool hath grown wise. He hath renounced his gods, the things of wood and stone! Gabriel. The Christian name prevaileth. Its dominion Groweth in all the land. From Candia to Cathay The fear of Christ is spread, and wide through Africa. The Lord God. The fear? And not the love? Gabriel. Who knoweth Man's heart? All bow, And all proclaim His might. The manner and the how It were less safe to argue, since some frailties be. We take the outward act to prove conformity. All's well enough with Man—most well with Christendom. The Lord God. Again thou sayest “enough.” How fareth it in Rome? Hath My vicegerent rest? Gabriel. He sitteth as of old Enthroned in Peter's chair with glories manifold. He sang a mass this morning and I heard his prayer. The Lord God. For Peace? Gabriel. And Power on Earth. The Lord God. For Power? Hath he no care Other than his temporal rule? Gabriel. He hath his pastime too. He is Italian born and doeth as these do, He is happy uccellando, deeming it no sin In his own Vatican, its garden walls within, Watching his fowling-nets. “I watch and pray,” saith he: “Vigilate et orate.” Satan (aside). O simplicity! The Lord God. And are the Kings with him? Do all pray with one breath? Gabriel. Some priests and poor I saw,— Satan (aside). The poor he always hath. Gabriel His guards, his chamberlains. The Lord God. The mighty ones, the proud, Do they not kneel together daily in one crowd? Have they no common counsel? Gabriel. Kings have their own needs, Demanding separate service. Satan (aside). Ay, and their own creeds. One cause alone combines them, and one service—mine. The Lord God Thou sayest? Gabriel. Man still is Man. The Lord God. We did redeem his line And crown him with new worship. In the ancient days His was a stubborn neck. But now he hath found grace, Being born anew. His gods he hath renounced, sayest thou? He worshippeth the Christ? What more? Gabriel. Nay, 'tis enow. He is justified by faith. He hath no fear of Hell Since he hath won Thy grace. All's well with Man,—most well. The Lord God. “All's well!” The fair phrase wearieth. It hath a new false ring. Truce, Gabriel, to thy word-fence. Mark my questioning. Or rather no—not thou, blest Angel of all good, Herald of God's glad tidings to a world subdued, Thou lover tried of Man. I will not question thee, Lest I should tempt too sore and thou lie cravenly. Is there no other here, no drudge, to do that task And lay the secret bare, the face behind the mask? One with a soul less white, who loveth less, nay hates; One fit for a sad part, the Devil's advocate's; One who some wrong hath done, or hath been o'erborne of ill, And so hath his tongue loosed? O for a Soul with will! O for one hour of Satan! Satan. He is here, Lord God, Ready to speak all truths to Thy face, even “Ichabod, Thy glory is departed,” were that truth. The Lord God. Thou? Here? Satan. A suppliant for Thy pardon, and in love, not fear, One who Thou knowest doth love Thee, ay, and more than these. The Lord God. That word was Peter's once. Satan. I speak no flatteries; Nor shall I Thee deny for this man nor that maid, Nor for the cock that crew. The Lord God. Thou shalt not be gainsaid. I grant thee audience. Speak. Satan. Alone? The Lord God. 'Twere best alone, Angels, ye are dismissed. (The Angels depart.)Good Satan, now say on. Satan (alone with The Lord God). Omnipotent Lord God! Thou knowest all. I speak Only as Thy poor echo, faltering with words weak, A far-off broken sound, yet haply not unheard. Thou knowest the Worlds Thou madest, and Thine own high word Declaring they were good. Good were they in all sooth The mighty Globes Thou mouldedst in the World's fair youth, Launched silent through the void, evolving force and light. Thou gatheredst in Thy hand's grasp shards of the Infinite And churnedst them to Matter; Space concentrated, Great, glorious, everlasting. The Stars leaped and fled, As hounds, in their young strength. Yet might they not withdraw From Thy hand's leash and bond. Thou chainedst them with law. They did not sin, those Stars, change face, wax proud, rebel. Nay, they were slaves to Thee, things incorruptible. I might not tempt them from Thee. The Lord God. And the reason? Satan. Hear. Thou gavest them no Mind, no sensual atmosphere, Who wert Thyself their Soul. Though thou should drowse for aye, They should not swerve, nor flout Thee, nor abjure Thy way, Not by a hair's breadth, Lord. The Lord God. Thou witnessest for good. Satan. I testify for truth. In all that solitude Of spheres involved with spheres, of prodigal force set free, There hath been no voice untrue, no tongue to disagree, No traitor thought to wound with less than perfect word. Such was Thy first Creation. I am Thy witness, Lord. 'Twas worthy of Thyself. The Lord God. And of the second? Satan. Stop. How shall I speak of it unless Thou give me hope; I who its child once was, though daring to rebel; I who Thine outcast am, the banished thief of Hell, Thy too long reprobate? Thou didst create to Thee A world of happy Spirits for Thy company, For Thy delight and solace, as being too weary grown Of Thy sole loneliness. 'Twas ill to be alone. And Thou didst make us pure, as Thou Thyself art pure. Yet was there seed of ill. What Spirit may endure The friction of the Spirit? Where two are, Strife is. Thou gavest us Mind, Thought, Will; all snares to happiness. The Lord God. Unhappy blinded one! How sinnedst thou? Reveal. Satan. Lord, through my too great love, through my excess of zeal. Listen. Thy third Creation. . . . The Lord God. Ha! The Earth? Speak plain. Now will I half forgive thee. What of the Earth, of men? Was that not then the best, the noblest of the three? Satan. Ah, glorious Lord God! Thou hadst Infinity From which to choose Thy plan. This plan, no less than those, Was noble in conception, when its vision rose Before Thee in Thy dreams. Thou deemedst to endow Time with a great new wonder, wonderful as Thou, Matter made sensitive, informed with Life, with Soul. It grieved Thee the Stars knew not. Thou couldst not cajole Their music into tears, their beauty to full praise. Thou askedst one made conscious of Thy works and ways, One dowered with sense and passion, which should feel and move And weep with Thee and laugh, one that, alas, should love. Thus didst Thou mould the Earth. We Spirits, wondering, eyed Thy new-born fleshly things, Thy Matter deified. We saw the sea take life, its myriad forms all fair. We saw the creeping things, the dragons of the air, The birds, the four-foot beasts, all beautiful, all strong, All brimming o'er with joyance, new green woods among, Twice glorious in their lives. And we, who were but spirit, Envied their lusty lot, their duplicated merit, Their feet, their eyes, their wings, their physical desires, The anger of their voices, the fierce sexual fires Which lit their sentient limbs and joined them heart to heart, Their power to act, to feel, all that corporeal part Which is the truth of love and giveth the breathing thing The wonder of its beauty incarnate in Spring. What was there, Lord, in Heaven comparable with this, The mother beast with her young? Not even Thy happiness, Lord of the Universe! What beautiful, what bold, What passionate as she? She doth not chide nor scold When at her dugs he mumbleth. Nay, the milk she giveth Is as a Sacrament, the power by which he liveth A double life with hers. And they two in one day Know more of perfect joy than we, poor Spirits, may In our eternity of sober loneliness. This was the thing we saw, and praised Thee and did bless. The Lord God. Where then did the fault lie? Thou witnessest again. Was it because of Death, Life's complement,—or Pain, That thou didst loose thy pride to question of My will? Satan. Nay, Lord, Thou knowest the truth. These evils are not ill. They do but prove Thy wisdom. All that lives must perish, Else were the life at charge, the bodily fires they cherish, Accumulating ills. The creatures Thou didst make Sink when their day is done. They slough time like the snake How many hundred sunsets? Yet night comes for rest, And they awake no more,—and sleep,—and it is best. What, Lord, would I not give to shift my cares and lie Enfolded in Time's arms, stone-dead, eternally? No. 'Twas not Death, nor Pain; Pain the true salt of pleasure, The condiment that stings and teaches each his measure, The limit of his strength, joy's value in his hand. It was not these we feared. We bowed to Thy command, Even to that stern decree which bade the lion spring Upon the wealking steer, the falcon bend her wing To reive the laggard fowl, the monster of the deep Devour and be devoured. He who hath sown shall reap. And we beheld the Earth by that mute law controlled, Grow ever young and new, Time's necklace of pure gold Set on Creation's neck. We gazed, and we applauded The splendour of Thy might, Thy incarnated Godhead. And yet (Lord God, forgive. Nay, hear me) Thou wert not Content with this fair world in its first glorious thought: Thou needs must make thee Man. Ah, there Thy wisdom strayed. Thou wantedst one to know Thee, no mere servile jade, But a brave upright form to walk the Earth and be Thy lieutenant with all and teach integrity, One to aspire, adorn, to stand the roof and crown Of thy Creation's house in full dominion, The fairest, noblest, best of Thy created things; One Thou shouldst call Thy rose of all Time's blossomings. And Thou evolvedst Man!—There were a thousand forms, All glorious, all sublime, the riders of Thy storms, The battlers of Thy seas, the four-foot Lords of Earth, From which to choose Thy stem and get Thee a new birth. There were forms painted, proud, bright birds with plumes of heaven And songs more sweet than angels' heard on the hills at even, Frail flashing butterflies, free fishes of such hue As rainbows hardly have, sleek serpents which renew Their glittering coats like gems, grave brindle-hided kine, Large-hearted elephants, the horse how near divine, The whale, the mastodon, the mighty Behemoth, Leviathan's self awake and glorious in his wrath. All these Thou hadst for choice, competitors with Thee For Thy new gift and prize, Thy co-divinity. Yet didst Thou choose, Lord God, the one comedian shape In Thy Creation's range, the lewd bare-buttocked ape, And calledst him, in scorn of all that brave parade, King of Thy living things, in Thine own likeness made! Where, Lord, was then Thy wisdom? We, who watched Thee, saw More than Thyself didst see. We recognised the flaw, The certainty of fault, and I in zeal spake plain. The Lord God. Thou didst, rebellious Spirit, and thy zeal was vain. Thou spakest in thy blindness. Was it hard for God, Thinkest thou, to choose His graft, to wring from the worst clod His noblest fruiting? Nay. Man's baseness was the test, The text of His all-power, its proof made manifest. There was nought hard for God. Satan. Except to win Man's heart. Lord, hear me to the end. Thy Will found counterpart Only in Man's un-Will. Thy Truth in his un-Truth, Thy Beauty in his Baseness, Ruth in his un-Ruth, Order in his dis-Order. See, Lord, what hath been To Thy fair Earth through him, the fount and origin Of all its temporal woes. How was it ere he came In his high arrogance, sad creature without shame? Thou dost remember, Lord, the glorious World it was, The beauty, the abundance, the unbroken face Of undulent forest spread without or rent or seam From mountain foot to mountain, one embroidered hem Fringing the mighty plains through which Thy rivers strayed, Thy lakes, Thy floods, Thy marshes, tameless, unbetrayed, All virgin of the spoiler, all inviolate, In beauty undeflowered, where fear was not nor hate. Thou knowest, Lord of all, how that sanct solitude Was crowded with brave life, a thousand forms of good Enjoying Thy sweet air, some strong, some weak, yet none Oppressor of the rest more than Thy writ might run. Armed were they, yet restrained. Not even the lion slew His prey in wantonness, nor claimed beyond his due. He thinned their ranks,—yet, lo, the Spring brought back their joy. Short was his anger, Lord. He raged not to destroy. Oh, noble was the World, its balance held by Thee, Timely its fruits for all, 'neath Thy sole sovereignty. But he! he, the unclean! The fault, Lord God, was Thine. Behold him in Thy place, a presence saturnine, In stealth among the rest, equipped as none of these With Thy mind's attributes, low crouched beneath the trees, Betraying all and each. The wit Thou gavest him He useth to undo, to bend them to his whim. His bodily strength is little, slow of foot is he, Of stature base, unclad in mail or panoply. His heart hath a poor courage. He hath beauty none. Bare to the buttocks he of all that might atone. Without Thy favour, Lord, what power had he for ill? Without Thy prompting voice his violence had scant skill. The snare, the sling, the lime, who taught him these but Thou? The World was lost through Thee who fashioned him his bow. And Thou hast clean forgot the fair great beasts of yore, The mammoth, aurochs, elk, sea-lion, cave-bear, boar, Which fell before his hand, each one of them than he Nobler and mightier far, undone by treachery. He spared them not, old, young, calf, cow. With pitfall hid In their mid path they fell, by his guile harvested, And with them the World's truth. Hence forth all walked in fear, Knowing that one there was turned traitor, haply near. This was the wild man's crime. The Lord God. He erred in ignorance. As yet he was not Man. Naught but his form was Man's. Satan. Well had he so remained. Lord God, Thou thoughtest then To perfect him by grace, among the sons of men To choose a worthiest man. “If he should know,” saidst Thou “The evil from the good, the thing We do allow From that We do forbid! If We should give him shame, The consciousness of wrong, the red blush under blame! If he should walk in light beholding truth as We!” Thou gavest him Conscience, Creed, Responsibility, The power to worship Thee. Thou showedst him Thy way. Thou didst reveal Thyself. Thou spakest, as one should say Conversing mouth to mouth. Old Adam and his Eve Thou didst array in aprons Thy own hands did weave. Enoch was taken up. To Noah Thou didst send Salvation in Thine ark. Lord Abraham was Thy friend. These are the facts recorded, facts (say fables) yet Impressed with the large truth of a new value set Upon Man's race and kind by Thy too favouring will. Man had become a Soul, informed for good and ill With Thy best attributes, Earth's moral arbiter, Tyrant and priest and judge. Woe and alas for her! Think of the deeds of Man! the sins! No wilding now, But set in cities proud, yet marked upon his brow With label of all crime. The Lord God. The men before the Flood? We did destroy them all. Satan. Save Noah and his brood. In what were these more worthy? Did they love Thee more, The men of the new lineage? Was their sin less sore, Their service of more zeal? Nay. Earth was hardly dry Ere their corruption stank and their sin sulphurously Rose as a smoke to Heaven, Ur, Babel, Nineveh, The Cities of the Plain. Bethink Thee, Lord, to-day What their debasement was, who did defile Thy face And flout Thee in derision, dogs in shamelessness! The Lord God. Nay, but there loved Me one. Satan. The son of Terah? The Lord God. He. Satan. I give Thee Thy one friend. Nay, more, I give Thee three— Moses, Melchisedec. The Lord God. And Job. Satan. Ay, Job. He stands In light of the new Gospel, Captain of Thy bands, And prince of all that served Thee, fearing not to find Thy justice even in wrong with no new life behind, Thy justice even in death. In all, four men of good Of the whole race of Shem, Heaven's stars in multitude. (I speak of the old time and the one chosen Nation To whom Thou gavest the law.) The Lord God. Truce to that dispensation. It was an old-world hope, made void by Jacob's guile. His was a bitter stem. We bore with it awhile, Too long, till We grew weary. But enough. ’Tis done. What sayest thou of the new, most wise Apollyon? Satan. Ah, Lord, wilt Thou believe me? That was a mighty dream, Sublime, of a world won by Thy Son's stratagem Of being Himself a Man—the rueful outcast thing! And of all men a Jew! for poor Earth's ransoming. Thrice glorious inspiration! Who but He had dared Come naked, as He came, of all His kingship bared, Not one of us to serve Him, neither praised nor proud But just as the least are, the last ones of the crowd. He had not Man's fierce eye. No beast fell back abashed To meet Him in the woods, as though a flame had flashed. He lay down with the foxes. The quails went and came Between His feet asleep. They did not fear His blame. He had not Man's hard heart. He had not Man's false hand. His gesture was as theirs. Their wit could understand He was their fellow flesh. To Him, so near to God, What difference lay 'twixt Man and the least herb He trod? He came to save them all, to win all to His peace. What cared He for Man, Jew, more than the least of these? And yet He loved His kind, the sick at heart, the poor, The impotent of will, those who from wrong forbore, Those without arms to strike, the lost of Israel. Of these He made His kingdom—as it pleased Him well— Kingdom without a king. His thought was to bring back Earth to its earlier way, ere Man had left the track, And stay his rage to slay. “Take ye no thought,” said He, “Of what the day may bring. Be as the lilies be. They toil not, nore do spin, and yet are clothed withal. Choose ye the lowest place. Be guileless of all gall. If one shall smite you, smile. If one shall rob, give more. The first shall be the last, and each sould hold its store. Only the eyes that weep—only the poor in spirit— Only the pure in heart God's kingdom shall inherit.” On this fair base of love Thy Son built up His creed, Thinking to save the world. And Man, who owned no need Of any saving, slew Him. The Lord God. It was the Jews that slew In huge ingratitude Him who Himself was Jew. O perfidi Judaei! Yet His creed prevailed. Thou hast thyself borne witness. If Shem's virtue failed, Japhet hath found us sons who swear all by His name. Nay, thou hast testified the Christian faith finds fame In every western land. It hath inherited All that was once called Rome. The Orient bows its head Perturbed by the white vision of a purer day. Ham's heritage accepts new salves for its decay, And there are worlds reborn beyond the ocean's verge Where men are not as men, mad foam on the salt surge, But live even as He taught them in love's noblest mood, Under the law of Jesus. Satan. Where, O glorious God? In what land of the heathen—and I know them all, From China to Peru, from Hind to Senegal, And onward through the isles of the great Southern main. Where is this miracle? Nay, nay, the search were vain. The Lord God. It is the angels' hearsay. Satan. A romance, Lord. Hear The word of one Thy wanderer, sphere and hemisphere, For ever on Thy Earth, who, shepherding Thy seas No less than Thy green valleys, hath nor rest nor peace, But he must learn the way of all who in them dwell; To whom there is no secret, naught untold, no Hell Where any sin may hide but he hath wormed it out From silence to confession till his ears grew hot; Who knoweth the race of Man as his own flesh; whose eye Is cruel to evasion and the lips that lie, And who would tell Thee all, all, all to the last act Of tragic fooling proved which seals Man's counterpact. —What was the true tale, think Thee, of Thy Son that died? What of the souls that knew Him, Him the crucified, After their Lord was gone? They waited for Him long, The sick He had made whole, the wronged consoled of wrong, The women He had loved, the fisher folk whose ears Had drunk in His word's wisdom those three wondrous years, And deemed Him prophet, prince, His kingdom yet to come, Nay from the grave new-risen and had been seen of some. What did they teach? Awhile, they told His law of peace, His rule of unresistance and sweet guilelessness, His truce with mother Earth, His abstinence from toil, His love of the least life that wanton hands despoil, The glory of His tears, His watching, fasting, prayer, The patience of His death, His last word of despair. And as He lived they lived—awhile—expectant still Of His return in power to balance the Earth's ill. They would not deem Him dead. But, when He came not, lo, Their reason went astray. Poor souls, they loved Him so, They had such grief for Him, their one true God in Man Revealed to their sad eyes in all a World grown wan, That they must build a creed, a refuge from their fears In His remembered words and so assuage their tears. His kingdom? It was what? Not all a dream? Forbid That fault, that failure, Heaven, for such were death indeed. His promises of peace, goodwill on earth to men, Which needed a fulfilment, lest faith fail? How then Since no fulfilment came, since He had left them lone In face of the world's wolves, for bread had given a stone? How reconcile His word with that which was their life, Man's hatred and God's silence in a world of strife? Was there no path, no way? Nay, none on this sad Earth Save with their Lord to suffer and account it mirth. And so awhile they grieved. Then rose a subtlety. (Lord God, Thou knowest not wholly how men crave to lie In face of a hard truth too grievous to their pride.) To these poor fisher folk, thus of their Lord denied, Came a new blinding vision. They had seen Thy Son How often after death, no ghost, no carrion, But a plain man alive, who moved among them slow, And showed His feet and hands, the thorn prints on His brow, The spear wound in His side. He had come to comfort them, Confirm them in the faith, by His love's stratagem. How if this thing were real? if this, that proved Him God, Proved also themselves spirits, not mere flesh and blood One with the beasts that perish, but immortal souls, Even as we angels are who fill Heaven's muster rolls And so shall live for aye? “Here,” argued they, “it stands The kingdom of His Heaven, a house not made with hands, Wherein we too new-born, but in no earthly case, Shall enter after death.” On this fair fragile base Their sorrow built its nest. It gave a hope to men And pandered to their pride. And lo the world's disdain Was changed to acclamation. Kings and emperors kneeled Before the Crucified, a living God revealed, Who made them heirs with Him of His own glory. (Mark The ennobling phrase and title.) No base Noah's ark Man's fount of honour now, but God's eternal choice Made of His human race, predestined to His joys From the first dawn of time,—the very Universe Resolved to a mere potsherd, shattered to rehearse The splendour of Man's advent, the one act and end To which Creation moved, and where even we must tend, The spirit hosts of Heaven! Stark mad insolence! Rank blasphemy proclaimed in Rome's halls and Byzance, Through all the Imperial lands, as though, forsooth, Thou, Lord, Couldst, even if Thou wouldst, raise this fantastic horde Of bodies to Thy glory, shapes dispersed and gone As lightly as Time's wracks swept to oblivion! Yet all believed this creed. Space, straightway grown too strait, Shrank from these Christened kings, who held Earth reprobate Save for their own high calling. Heaven had become their throne, A fief for their new pride, in which they reigned alone, In virtue of their faith, above Time's humbler show, And Earth became their footstool. All were masters now Of the brute beasts despised who had no sould to save, And lords too of the heathen doomed beyond the grave. God's kingdom had begun. It compassed all the lands And trafficked wealth and power. It issued its commands, And in default it slew in Thy high holy name, Thine the all merciful! Alas for the world's shame! Alas for the world's reason, for Thy Son's sane creed Of doing only good each day to its own need, Of being as the least of these in wise humility! Behold our Christian Saints, too proud to live or die As all flesh dies and lives, their emperors and kings Clothed in the robes of life as with an eagle's wings, Their Popes dispensing power, their priests absolving sin. Nay. They have made a Hell their damned shall dwell within, With me for their gaolmaster in a world to come Of which they hold the keys! God's curse on Christendom! The Lord God. Hush, traitor, thou blasphemest. If things once were so, 'Twas in a darkened age, the night of long ago. None now believe in Hell. Satan. Or Heaven. Forgive it, Lord, I spoke it in my haste. See, I withdraw the word. Thy Christendom is wise, reformed. None buy nor sell Seats now at Thy right hand; (aside)grown quite unsaleable. None now believe nor tremble. Yet is their sin as sore. (Lord, hear me to the end.) Thou dravest me out of yore An exile from Thy sight, with mission to undo And tempt Man to his death. I had fallen from Heaven's blue By reason of my pride. Thou wouldst have service done Unreasoning, on the knees, as flowers bend to the Sun, Which withers them at noon, nor ask of his white fires Why they consume and slay. I had fallen by my desires Which were too large for one not God, because I would Have shown Thee the truth bare, in no similitude As a slave flattering speaks and half despises him He fawns on, but in love, which stands erect of limb Claiming an equal part, which reasons, questions, dares, And calls all by its name, the wheat wheat, the tares tares, The friend friend, the foe foe. Thou wast displeased at this, And deemed I envied Man his portion in Thy bliss, The Man that Thou hadst made and in Thy royal faith Held worthy of all trust, Thy lord of life and death, One to be proved and tried, as gold is tried by fire, And fare the purer forth. Of me Thou didst require The sad task of his tempting. I, forsooth, must sue And prompt to evil deeds, make the false thought seem true, The true thought false, that he, thus proved, thus tried, might turn And hurl me a dog's word, as Jesus did, in scorn: “Get thee behind Me, Satan!” To this penance chained I bowed me in despair, as Thou, Lord, hadst ordained, Cast out from Thee and cursed. It was a rueful task For one who had known Thee to wear the felon's mask And tempt this piteous child to his base sins of greed, His lusts ignoble, crimes how prompt in act and deed, To urge him to rebellion against God and good Who needed none to urge. His savage simian blood Flamed at a word, a sign. He lied, he thieved, he slew, By instinct of his birth. No virtue but he knew Its countervice and foil, without my wit to aid. No fair thought but he chose the foul thought in its stead. Ah, sad primæval race! Thou saidst it was not Man This thing armed with the stone which through thy forests ran, Intent to snare and slay. Not Man the senseless knave Who struck fire from his flint to burn Thy gorses brave, Thy heaths for his lean kine, who, being the one unclean, Defiled thy flower-sweet Earth with ordure heaps obscene To plant his rice, his rye. Not Man, saidst Thou, because He knew not of Thy way nor had he learned Thy laws, And was stark savage still. Not Man? Behold to-day Thy tamed Man as he lives, Thy Son of Japhet, nay Thy new true-Christened King, the follower of Thy Christ, Who sweareth by Thy name and his own mailéd fist That Thou art Lord of all and he the Lord of Thee, Heaven's instrument ordained to teach integrity. Thinkest Thou the man is changed, the ape that in him is, Because his limbs are clothed which went in shamelessness? Are his lusts bridled more because his parts are hid? Nay, Lord, he doeth to-day as those forefathers did, Only in greater guile. I will tell Thee his full worth, This Man's, the latest born, Thy creature from his birth Who lords it now, a king, this white Man's who hath pressed All Earth to his sole bondage and supreme behest, This Man of all Mankind. Behold him in Thy place, Administering the World, vicegerent of Thy grace And agent named of Thee, the symbol and the sign Of Thy high will on Earth and purposing divine, Clothed in his robes of power. Whence was he? What is he That he asserteth thus his hand's supremacy? His lineage what? Nay, Lord, he cometh of that mad stem Harder in act than Ham's, more subtle than of Shem, The red Japhetic stock of the bare plains which rolled A base-born horde on Rome erewhile in lust of gold, Tide following tide, the Goth, Gaul, Vandal, Lombard, Hun, Spewed forth from the white North to new dominion In the fair southern lands, with famine at their heel And rapine in their van, armed to the lips with steel. These made their spoil of all, the pomp of the world's power, Its wealth, its beauty stored, all Rome's imperial dower, Her long renown, her skill, her art, her cultured fame, And with the rest her faiths bearing the Christian name. From this wild bitter root of violent lust and greed New Christendom upsprang, a pagan blood-stained creed, Pagan in spite of Christ, for the old gods cast down Still ruled it in men's hearts and lured them to renown, Ay in Thy name, Lord God, by glamour of the sword, And for Thy dead Son's sake, as in the days abhorred. Like bulls they strove, they slew, like wolves they seized the prey, The hungriest strongest first, and who should say them nay? After the Goth the Gaul, after the Gaul the Dane, Kings in descent from Thor, peace sued to them in vain. Thou knowest, Lord God, their story. It is writ in blood, The blood of beast and man, by their brute hands subdued, Down to the latest born, the hungriest of the pack, The master wolf of all, men call the Sassenach, The Anglo-Norman dog, who goeth by land and sea As his forefathers went in chartered piracy, Death, fire in his right hand. The Lord God. Satan, once more beware. Thy tongue hath a wide license, yet it runneth far. This Anglo-Saxon man hath a fair name with some. He standeth in brave repute, a priest of Christendom, First in civility, so say the Angel host, Who speak of him with awe as one that merits most. Satan. The Angels fear him, Lord. The Lord God. How fear? Satan. They fear his tongue, Unscrupulous to speak, the right he hath in wrong, The wrong he hath in right. They doubt he hath Thine ear, Lord of the Universe. They are excused of fear. They see his long success, his victory over good, They count the nations lost which were of kindlier blood But could not stand before him, his great subtlety, His skill in the arts, the crafts. They mark the powers that be In earth, air, water, fire, all banded in his plan And used to the world's hurt as never yet by Man. They look on Thee, Lord God, as one that careth not, On him as Thy supplanter and the iron as hot Which shall reforge the chain by which the Earth is bound. They fear to awaken Thee from Thy long sleep profound. He hath become their God, one impious and profane, But strong and unreproved, ascendant on Thy wane. They kneel to the new-comer as all courtiers use Who fear a change of king. Their news is an ill news. Nay, Lord, 'tis but a lie. I know it well, their story. 'Tis but the man's own boast, his mouthings of vain glory Repeated day by day with long reiterate stress, Till the world half believes in sheer ear-weariness, And they, who think to please, retail it as their own. What say they of him, Lord? That he hath one God alone, Is not as the lewd nations, keepeth Thy Sabbath holy, Nor Thy name vainly taketh in the ways of folly, Hath a wise polity, his Church and State close blent, A lordly bench of bishops, peers of Parliament, A Convocation House which yearly witnesseth, A King by grace of God, Defender of the Faith, Thy ten commandments set in all his Courts of Law. They show his fanes restored by highway, hedge and shaw, His missions to the Jews, his Church societies, The zeal of his free sects, each than the rest more wise, The wealth of his chief priests, his weekly public prayer, Things proving him devout more than the nations are. They cite his worldly worth, his virtue these beyond, His high repute in trade, his word held as his bond, The valour of his dealings, his long boast of truth, The prudent continence of his unwedded youth, Uxorious faith in marriage, husband of one wife, Nor taking her next sister to his widowed life. These tales they hear and bring, some true, some false, but all Of the common Saxon brag for first original. So too of his world-science, social schemes, reforms, His school-boards, gaols new systemed, signalling of storms, Posts, railways, Homes for orphans, Charities organised, His Mansion House funds floated, alms economised, His hospitals, museums, baths, parks, workhouses, And that last glorious marvel, his free Daily Press. A wonderful Saxon truly, each day interviewed By his own wondering self and found exceeding good. All this and more they cite. That he hath virtues, well, Let it be granted him. Those pay who most would sell, And more who most would buy. Alms to his credit stand In his account with time, and add strength to his hand, Serving his best advantage in the enlarged domain Of his Man's selfishness, which works for the World's bane More surely than his vices. He hath outlived the day Of the old single graspings, where each went his way Alone to plunder all. He hath learned to curb his lusts Somewhat, to smooth his brawls, to guide his passionate gusts, His cry of “mine, mine, mine” in inarticulate wrath. He dareth not make raid on goods his next friend hath With open violence, nor loose his hand to steal, Save in community and for the common weal 'Twixt Saxon man and man. He is more congruous grown, Holding a subtler plan to make the world his own By organised self-seeking in the paths of power. He is new drilled to wait. He knoweth his appointed hour And his appointed prey. Of all he maketh tool, Even of his own sad virtues, to cajole and rule, Even of Thee, Lord God.—I will expound this thing, The creed of these white thieves which boast of Thee, their King, As partner in their crimes. The head knaves of the horde, Those who inspire the rest and give the masterword, The leaders of their thought, their lords political, Sages, kings, poets, priests, in their hearts one and all (For all their faith avowed and their lip service done In face of Thy high fires each day beneath the sun), Ay, and their prelates too, their men of godliest worth, Believe no word of Thee as Master of their Earth, Controller of their acts, no word of Thy high right To bend men to obedience and at need to smite, No word of Thy true law, the enforcement of Thy peace, Thy all-deciding arm in the world's policies. They ignore Thee on the Earth. They grant Thee, as their “God,” The kingdom of the heavens, seeing it a realm untrod, Untreadable by man, a space, a res nullius Or No-Man's Land, which they as loyal men and pious Leave and assign to Thee to deal with as Thou wilt, To hold as Thy strong throne or loose as water spilt For sun and wind to gather in the wastes of air. Whether of a truth Thou art they know not, Lord, nor care; Only they name Thee “God,” and pay Thee their prayers vain, As dormant over-lord and pensioned suzerain, The mediatised blind monarch of a world, outgrown Of its faith's swaddling-clothes, which wills to walk alone, The Earth? Not so. 'Tis theirs, the prize of the strong hand, The strongest being their own by sea alike and land. “Thy Will be done,” they cry, “Father which art in Heaven” (Where Thou canst harm nor hurt not one day in the seven). And if they add “on Earth” they deem Thee impotent, Seeing Thee drowse thus long and leave men to their bent. They mean “Thy Will in Heaven,” or in their “World to come.” “Terram autem dedit filiis hominum.” So think their chiefs, their lords. For the blind mass of men, Which live and toil and die heart-hungry in their pen, They have no god but gold, the lord of their distress, And gold's slave, drink, that buys a night's forgetfulness. Of Thee they have no heed to chide them or to cheer. The fear of Thee with these is their law's officer. Lord God, if Thou but saw the pagan hearts they hide, The base greeds of their being, the lusts undenied, The Mammons that they worship! But Thou dost not see, Or Thou hadst purged long since this worst profanity From the World's better way and thereby saved Thy name Profaned in their foul mouths from its long daily shame. Thou dost not hear, nor see. The smoke of their foul dens Broodeth on Thy fair Earth as a black pestilence, Hiding the kind day's eye. No flower, no grass there groweth, Only their engines' dung which the fierce furnace throweth. Their presence poisoneth all and maketh all unclean. Thy streams they have made sewers for their dyes aniline. No fish therein may swim, no frog, no worm may crawl, No snail for grime may build her house within their wall. Thy beasts they have enslaved in blindness underground. The voice of birds that sang to them is a lost sound. Nay, they have tarred Time's features, pock-marked Nature's face, Brought all to the same jakes with their own lack of grace. In all Thy living World there is no sentient thing Polluteth and defileth as this Saxon king, This intellectual lord and sage of the new quest, The only wanton he that fouleth his own nest. And still his boast goeth forth. Nay, Lord, 'tis shame to Thee This slave, being what he is, should ape divinity, The poorest saddest drudge, the least joy-lifted heart In all a World where tears are sold in open mart, That he should stand, Thy choice, to preach Thy law, and set His impress on the Earth in full apostolate, Thy missioner and priest. He goeth among the nations, Saith he, to spread Thy truth, to preach Thy law of patience, To glorify Thy name! Not selfishly, forsooth, But for their own more good, to open them the truth, To teach them happiness, to civilise, to save, To smite down the oppressor and make free the slave. To bear the “White Man's Burden,” which he yearns to take On his white Saxon back for his white conscience' sake. Huge impudent imposture!—Lord, there were fair lands Once on Thy Earth, brave hills, bright isles, sweet coral strands, Noble savannahs, plains of limitless waving green, Lakes girt with giant forests, continents unseen, Unknown by these white thieves, where men lived in the way Of Thy good natural law with Thy free beasts at play And partners with Thy birds, men who nor toiled nor span, Nor sowed, nor reaped, nor delved for the red curse of Man, The gold that kills the soul; who knew nought of the fire Which in his guns he storeth, naught of the desire More deadly still concealed in his fire-drink of death; Who went unclothed, unshamed, for garment a flower wreath; Whose women lived unsold and loved their natural kin, Nor gave aught to the stranger in the wage of sin; Who blessed Thee for their babes and through the woods, like Eve, Wandered in happy laughter, glorying to conceive. Yea, Lord, and there were others,—shut communities Of souls still on Thy path and strange to the new lies, Yet not, as these were, wild, but held in discipline Of orderly commandment, servants true of Thine And doers of Thy law, though ignorant, untaught Save by an inward grace of self-restraining thought And light intuitive. No shedders they of blood, But with all creatures friends, with men in brotherhood, Blameless of wine, of strife; in innocent arts well skilled But schoolless of all guile as an unchristened child. To these with mouthings fine come the white gospellers, Our Saxon mission-men black-coated to the ears. —“Which be your gods?” ask they; “Do ye adore the Christ? Know ye the Three in One, or walk ye in the mist?” “Sirs, we have One, not Three. Our poor ancestral wit Encompasseth no more.” “Then be ye damned for it. This is our Bible, read. In the long after-death Ye shall be burned with fire. It is God's self that saith.” “We do not live again.” “In this life, ye shall live According to our gospel, nor profanely wive Save with one spouse alone.” “Our law hath given us three. Three Gods to one sole wife were multiplicity.” “These pagans are blasphemers! Who is on our side? See, we have gold to give. We may not be denied.”— And they baptize them Christians. Cometh the trader next, His bible too in hand, its free-trade for his text. He teacheth them to buy.—“We nothing need.” “Yet take. The want will come anon and keep your wits awake. Here are the goods we sell, cloth, firelocks, powder, rum, Ye shall go clothed like lords, like kings of Christendom.” “We live best naked.” “Fie.” “We have no use for arms. The fire-drink is forbid.” “The thing forbid hath charms. Nay. We will make you men, soldiers to brawl and fight As all good Christians use, and God defend the right. The drink will give you courage. Take it. 'Tis the sign Of manhood orthodox, its sacramental wine, Or how can you be worthy your new Christian creed? Drink.”—And they drink to Jesus and are borne to bed. He teacheth them to sell.—“We need coin for our draught. How shall we bring the price, since ye give naught for naught? We crave the fire-drink now.” “Friends, let not that prevent. We lend on all your harvests, take our cent per cent.” “Sirs, but the crop is gone.” “There is your land in lots.” “The land? It was our fathers'.” “Curse ye for idle sots, A rascal lazing pack. Have ye no hands to work? Off to the mines and dig, and see it how ye shirk.” “As slaves?” “No, not as slaves. Our principles forbid. Free labourers, if you will. We use that word instead. The ‘dignity of labour’ ye shall learn for hire. No paltering. No excuse. The white man hates a liar, And hates a grumbling hand. Enough if we provide Tools with the drink and leave your backs with a whole hide. These lands are ours by Charter. If you doubt it, bring Your case before the Courts, which will expound the thing. As for your women folk. Look, there are ways well known All women have of living in a Christian town. Moreover you do ill. One wife the law allows, And you, you say, have four. Send three round to our house.” —Thus is Thy gospel preached. Its issue, Lord, behold In the five Continents, the new world and the old, The happier tribes of Man despoiled, enslaved, betrayed To the sole white Man's lust, husband and wife and maid, Their laughter drowned in tears, their kindness in mad wrath, Their dignity of joy in a foul trance of death, Till at the last they turn and in their anguish rend. Then loud the cry goeth forth, the white man's to each friend: “Help! Christians, to our help! These black fiends murder us.” And the last scene is played in death's red charnel house. The Saxon anger flames. His ships in armament Bear slaughter on their wings. The Earth with fire is rent, And the poor souls misused are wiped from the world's face In one huge imprecation from the Saxon race, In one huge burst of prayer and insolent praise to Thee, Lord God, for Thy high help and proved complicity. Nay Lord, 'tis not a lie, the thing I tell Thee thus. Their bishops in their Churches lead, incredulous, The public thanks profane. They sanctify the sword: “Te Deum laudamus. Give peace in our time, O Lord.” Hast Thou not heard their chaunting? Nay, Thou dost not hear, Or Thou hadst loosed Thy hand like lightning in the clear To smite their ribald lips with palsy, these false priests, These Lords who boast Thine aid at their high civic feasts, The ignoble shouting crowds, the prophets of their Press, Pouring their daily flood of bald self-righteousness, Their poets who write big of the “White Burden.” Trash! The White Man's Burden, Lord, is the burden of his cash. —There! Thou hast heard the truth. Thy world, Lord God of Heaven, Lieth in the hands of thieves who pillage morn and even. And Thou still sleepest on! Nay but Thou needs must hear Or abdicate Thy name of High Justiciar Henceforward and for ever. It o'erwhelmeth Thee With more than temporal shame. Thy silence is a Sea Crying through all the spheres in pain and ceasing not As blood from out the ground to mark crime's murder spot: “There is no hope—no truth. He hath betrayed the trust. The Lord God is unjust. The Lord God is unjust.” [A cry without. This is their cry in Heaven who give Thee service true. Arise, Lord, and avenge as was Thy wont to do. [The Angels re-enter in disorder, weeping. The Lord God. What tears be these, my Sons? What ails ye that ye weep? Speak, Shepherds of the flock! Ye that have cared my sheep! Ye that are charged with Man! Is it as this One saith? Is Satan then no liar who loudly witnesseth Man's ruin of the World? The Angel of Pity (coming forward). Lord, it is even so. Thy Earth is a lost force, Man's lazar-house of woe, Undone by his lewd will. We may no longer strive. The evil hath prevailed. There is no soul alive That shall escape his greed. We spend our days in tears Mourning Thy world's lost beauty in the night of years. All pity is departed. Each once happy thing That on Thy fair Earth went, how fleet of foot or wing, How glorious in its strength, how wondrous in design, How royal in its raiment tinctured opaline, How rich in joyous life, the inheritor of forms All noble, all of worth, which had survived the storms, The chances of decay in the World's living plan From the remote fair past when still ignoble Man On his four foot-soles went and howled through the lone hills In moody bestial wrath, unclassed among Earth's ills: Each one of them is doomed. From the deep Central Seas To the white Poles, Man ruleth pitiless Lord of these, And daily he destroyeth. The great whales he driveth Beneath the northern ice, and quarter none he giveth, Who perish there of wounds in their huge agony. He presseth the white bear on the white frozen sea And slaughtereth for his pastime. The wise amorous seal He flayeth big with young; the walrus cubs that kneel But cannot turn his rage, alive he mangleth them, Leaveth in breathing heaps, outrooted branch and stem. In every land he slayeth. He hath new engines made Which no life may withstand, nor in the forest shade Nor in the sunlit plain, which wound all from afar, The timorous with the valiant, waging his false war, Coward, himself unseen. In pity, Lord, look down On the blank widowed plains which he hath made his own By right of solitude. Where, Lord God, are they now, Thy glorious bison herds, Thy ariels white as snow, Thy antelopes in troops, the zebras of Thy plain? Behold their whitened bones on the dull track of men. Thy elephants, Lord, where? For ages thou didst build Their frames' capacity, the hide which was their shield No thorn might pierce, no sting, no violent tooth assail, The tusks which were their levers, the lithe trunk their flail. Thou strengthenedst their deep brain. Thou madest them wise to know And wiser to ignore, advised, deliberate, slow, Conscious of power supreme in right. The manifest token Of Thy high will on earth, Thy natural peace unbroken, Unbreakable by fear. For ages did they move Thus, kings of Thy deep forest swayed by only love. Where are they now, Lord God? A fugitive spent few Used as Man's living targets by the ignoble crew Who boast their coward skill to plant the balls that fly, Thy work of all time spoiled, their only use to die That these sad clowns may laugh. Nay, Lord, we weep for Thee, And spend ourselves in tears for Thy marred majesty. Behold, Lord, what we bring—this last proof in our hands, Their latest fiendliest spoil from Thy fair tropic lands, The birds of all the Earth unwinged to deck the heads Of their unseemly women; plumage of such reds As not the sunset hath, such purples as no throne, Not even in heaven, showeth (hardly, Lord, Thine own), Such azures as the sea's, such greens as are in Spring The oak trees' tenderest buds of watched-for blossoming, Such opalescent pearls as only in Thy skies The lunar bow revealeth to night's sleep-tired eyes. Behold them, Lord of Beauty, Lord of Reverence, Lord of Compassion, Thou who metest means to ends, Nor madest Thy world fair for less than Thine own fame, Behold Thy birds of joy lost, tortured, put to shame For these vile strumpets' whim! Arise, or cease to be Judge of the quick and dead! These dead wings cry to Thee! Arise, Lord, and avenge! The Angels. We wait upon Thy word. [The Lord God covereth His face. Satan. Thou hearest them, Lord God. The Lord God. Good Satan, I have heard. Thou art more just than I—alas, more just than I. The Angels. Behold the Lord God weepeth. The Angel of Pity. What eyes should be dry If for a crime eyes weep? This crime transcendeth crime. And the Lord God hath pity. Satan. In His own good time. The Lord God. Alas, the time is late. I do repent Me sore The wrong I did thee, Satan, in those griefs of yore, The wrong I did the Earth. Yet is Eternity A long day for atonement. Thou thyself shalt be My instrument here of wrath to purge this race of Man And cast him on Time's dunghill, whence he first began. What, Angel, is thy counsel? Shall we unseal again The fountains of the heavens, send our outpoured rain, And flood him with new waters? Shall it be by fire? Shall we embraize the earth in one vast funeral pyre By impact of a star? Let loose a sulphurous wind? Belch rocks from the Earth's bowels? Shall we strike Man blind With an unbearable light? Shall we so shake the hills, The plains, that he fall palsied, grind him in the mills Of a perpetual hail, importune him with snow, Scourge him with noise unceasing, or the glutinous flow Of a long pestilent stench? Speak, Satan, all thy thought, Thou who the traitor knowest. How may he be brought Best to annihilation? Satan. Lord, by none of these, Thy floods, Thy flames, Thy storms were puerilities. He hath too large a cunning to be taken thus. He would outride Thy waves, outblast Thy sulphurous Winds with his counter-winds. He liveth on foul air As on the breath of heaven. He hath nor thought nor care For Thy worst lightning strokes, holding their principle Rock-firm in his own hand. All natural powers fulfil His brain's omnipotence. He standeth at each point Armed for defiant war in harness without joint. Though Thou shouldst break the Earth in twain he should not bend. Thou needest a force to aid Thee, an ally, a friend, A principle of good which shall outwit his guile With true white guilelessness, his anger with a smile, His force with utter weakness. Only thus, Lord God, Shalt Thou regain Thy Earth, a purified abode, And rid it of the Human. The Lord God. And the means? Thy plan Needeth a new redemption. Satan. Ay, but not of Man. He is beyond redeeming, or Thy Son had died Not wholly to this loss. Who would be crucified To-day must choose another, a young fleshly form, Free from the simian taint, were it but flower or worm, Or limpet of the rock, or grieving nightingale, Wherein to preach his gospel. Yet should he previl, If only for truth's sake and that this latest lie Should be laid bare to shame, Time's fraud, Humanity. Choose Thee an Angel, Lord; it were enough. Thy Son Was a price all too great even had the world been won. Nor can it be again. An Angel shall suffice For Thy new second sending, so Thou guide the choice To a more reasoned issue—so Thou leave Mankind Henceforth to his sole ways as at his outset, blind To all but his own lusts, untutored by Thy grace. This is the road, Lord God. I bow before Thy face. I make Thee my submission to do all Thy will, So Thou absolve and pardon. The Lord God. O incomparable Good servant, Satan! Thou art absolved indeed. It was thy right to pardon thy God's lack of heed, His wrath at thy wise counsel. Nay, thou shamest Me. Be thou absolved, good Angel, Ego absolvo te Ab omnibus peccatis. Once more be it thy right To stand before God's throne for ever in His sight, And trusted more than these. Speak, Satan, what thou wilt, All shall be granted thee, the glory with the guilt Of the Earth lost and won. Who is it thou wouldst send Agent and messenger to work to this new end? What Angel of them all? I pledge thee My full faith It shall be as thou wilt. Satan. Who goeth must die the death, Since death is all life's law, and taste of corporal pain. And whoso dieth must die, nor think to live again. The Lord God. Shall it be Michael? Speak. Satan. Nay, Lord, nor Gabriel. They are Thy servants tried, who love Thy Heaven too well. Thou shalt not drive them forth to the wild wastes of Earth. What should they do, Lord God, with a terrestrial birth, With less than Thy long joys? Nay, rather choose Thee one Already marred with grief with Time's disunion, One all too sad for Heaven, to whom Eternity Is as a charge o'erspent, who hath no fear to die, But gladly would lie down and be for aye no more, The flotsam of Time's waves upon Death's outer shore, Forgotten and forgetting. Grant me, Lord God, this, In penance for the past, Death's full forgetfulness. The Lord God. And thou wouldst be incarnate? Satan. As the least strong thing, The frailest, the most fond, an insect on the wing, Which shall prevail by love, by ignorance, by lack Of all that Man most trusteth to secure his back, To arm his hand with might. What Thy Son dreamed of Man Will I work out anew as some poor cateran, The weakest of the Earth, with only beauty's power And Thy good grace to aid, the creature of an hour Too fugitive for fight, too frail even far to fly, And at the hour's end, Lord, to close my wings and die. Such were the new redemption. The Lord God. Thou good angel! Nay, The World were all unworthy such high price to pay. I will not have thee die. Satan. 'Tis not for the World's sake, Lord God of Heaven and Earth, that I petition make, But for Thy justice foiled. It irketh me to know That I have tutored Man against Thee, to this woe, And given him sure success. Yet is the World's self good, And I would prove it Thee, lest Man's ingratitude Should so affect all truth, all honour, all high faith, That Thou Thyself, Lord God, shouldst fall a prey to death And leave him in dominion. What to me were Heaven With this thought unappeased—even thus absolved, forgiven, Yet by myself condemned? The Lord God. Ah, Satan. Thy old pride Still lingereth in the clefts. Yet art thou not denied Since I have sworn thee faith. Go, thou good messenger, And God's peace go with thee. Ho! ye without! Give ear! Bow down to the Lord Satan, Our anointed priest, The new incarnate Word. The Angels. All hail! Michael (aside). The Anti-Christ! CORONATION ODE (1911) O Thou enfolded in grief, Man, with thy mantle of scorn! Arise and warn! Unloved prophet of ill Who sittest clothed in thy grief, In thy pride of unbelief, In thy silence of love forsworn! Speak thy word to the world; Let it be as a sword to thy will; Let it be as a spear that is hurled, A banner of wrath unfurled, A garment rent and torn. Speak. They shall listen to thee, A single voice at their feast. To the last and least, They shall hear what they loathe to hear. In the day of their Jubilee, Of their coronation feast, With the wine at their insolent lips, Though they lend no ear And their shoutings ring From the decks of a thousand ships Acclaiming their new-crowned king With a coronation cheer, They shall hear. Speak, in their jubilant hour, In the midst of their might and mirth. Be thy theme the Earth, The ancient tale of the lands of fame, Empires of earlier birth, Which held the world in their lust of power As their own for dower And abused their trust. Make thy theme of the wrath that came, The smoke that rose, the devouring flame, The day of glory, the night of shame And the end of dust. O thou enrobed in thy tears! Thou hast heard the children sing, The children that pass in the street, The innocent ones with their chauntings proud, The rhyme of their marching feet. How their voices sting! What is the word they say In their play, The hymn their young lips fashion? They have marched through the crowded ways With flags and glory and shoutings loud While the sun has looked down ablaze, Amazed at their joyous passion. Each one carries a sword, A wooden sword in his hand, With ribbon and belt and cord, And a gun on his shoulder glorious, Proud each one as a lord. “Soldiers,” they shout. “We are soldiers come From a battle-field. For, hark, the drum! From a field of fight victorious.” “Soldiers! Soldiers! Soldiers!” Weary am I Of that word forlorn, Of the king's command, Of the children's insolent cry, A nation's cry whom the nations scorn For its childish pride. Better were these unborn! England! Where is she? Where? Land of the fortunate free Which hath ceased to be? What hath she done with her fame? The nations that envied her Turned to her in their care, Sought her light upon land and sea, Called as once on her ancient name, The name of her liberty. But her ears were shut to their prayer; Her place was a sepulchre, She had ceased in her strength to be, She was no more free. She fell as a star from its place, As a bird from its path in the sky, As a spring run dry, A fruit in its rottenness, As a drunken woman prone on her face While the world went by, And she knew not her own disgrace. O thou, who hast seen her fall, Who hast witnessed her agony, Who hast looked on the face of the dead! Lift up thy voice in the night and cry “The harvest is harvested. As these shall have made their bed, So let them lie!” THREE PLAYS IN RHYMED VERSE FAND A FÉERIE IN THREE ACTS (Written for the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, and performed there in 1907.) DRAMATIS PERSONAE Cuchulain, son of Sualtim, champion of Ulster, otherwise called Settanta, or the Hound of Ulster. Conhor, King of Ulster. Laeg, Cuchulain's charioteer. Laegaire friends of Cuchulain. Lugaid friends of Cuchulain. Labraid, of the Quick Sword, King of the Sidhe, in Magh Mell. Manannan, a magician, King of the Sea. Emer, Cuchulain's wife. Fand, of the fair cheek, a fairy, wife to Manannan. Liban, sister to Fand, and wife to Labraid. Eithne, a poetess, beloved of Cuchulain. Male and female attendants, chorus of fairies, prisoners, etc. ACT I A room in the Speckled House at Emain. One portion of the stage is divided from the rest by a curtain. In it lies Cuchulain on a couch entranced, Laeg and Eithne with him. Outside Lugaid, Laegaire, and others, are playing noisily with dice, a flagon by them and horn cups. Eithne singing. She has a distaff and spindle. Eithne's Spinning Song Things of the Earth and things of the Air, Strengths that we feel though we cannot share, Shapes that are round us and everywhere. Things of the Sunlight and things of Sleep. Into what grave doth the spirit creep When limbs are loosened and life lies deep? Griefs that have blossomed, wounds that have bled. How shall we meet on the day of dread, When the dead are living, the living dead? Love is the master, and him we know, Deals us our portion of weal and woe, Leads us and leaves us to grieve and go. Laegaire (rising). I have had enough of this. I need the air, Lugaid. 'Tis a fool's life we lead here by this sick man's bed. Lugaid. Ay, a dog's life. Laegaire. I've done. He neither lives nor dies. I want the sun, the wind, the blue face of the skies, The white mists on the mountains. We are useless here. Lugaid. We will away to-morrow. Laegaire. We will chase the deer In the free forest, run, shout. We have become diseased With his mad malady. 'Tis time we were released. Lugaid. We have been a year here, watchers. What more can we do? We have done enough for him. Laegaire. We will leave him with these two, Who will watch on.—And Emer, she will be here anon. I sent for her last night. When all is said and done His wife is his best guard, albeit he forbade. The day Laeg bore him in from Baile's strand he was mad, As thou well knowest, mad; and we had promised him To carry out his bidding to the utmost whim; He would not hear of Emer. Yet time solves all vows, And small has been his profit in this Speckled House With Eithne for consoler, and her songs and tears. She has lost her power to soothe. He needs more wit than hers, However well she loves him. I have called Conhor too, His liege lord, whom he worships, his companion true. A wise man sure is Conhor. He will probe this thing And grant us our dismissal. Lugaid. See, he comes. (A voice.)The King! Enter Conhor, who approaches slowly and withdraws the curtain. Laeg rises, but Eithne sits weeping at Cuchulain's feet.) Conhor. He sleeps on? Laeg. Ay! he sleeps, and without change or sign More than a tree in winter, his breath infantine, His colour, as you see, a little paler grown Through the long lying here. His cheeks have lost their brown, His brows their manliness, and all his frame is slack As an uncoiled rope. Conhor. Yet he is sound? Laeg. We find no lack Of any bodily doing; hand, and foot, and limb, All seem compact, in order. Conhor. Can none waken him? Laegaire. Conhor, not one of us. A year it is to-day Since Laeg first laid him here. And still, do what we may, He sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps. He heeds us not at all. The weakness came on him at the Spring Festival. Some say it was the Sidhe, others a woman lewd Who took him unawares, where he lay in a wood Because the sun was hot, and scourged him at her will. He spoke to Laeg of faces fair and terrible, And not to be gainsaid, of a shape clothed in green, Another in clear crimson, and of a third, a queen, Who smote him with a rod, till he became a child And yielded to her will; and while she smote she smiled. He told this and no more; and the sun burned his head. And so they bore him here, as one less live than dead, To Eithne's Speckled House. He would not be brought home, Or hear of his wife Emer. He was mettlesome On this one point. And since that day of evil we, I, Laeg, and Lugaid, have watched him narrowly; And she, too, who weeps there. And we have hid him close, For our oath's sake and her great love, here in her house Unknown to all the world. And, Conhor, of a truth We are weary of our lives, and grudge our days of youth Spent idly in this room. We can no longer wait. Conhor. And she, too, is she weary? Laeg. Eithne? Ay! of late, In spite of her long love. Awhile her voice to him Served to bring understanding and a change of dream, And he would turn and listen while she sang. But now A month and more is past, and neither prayer, nor vow, Nor chant is of avail. We are weary to our death Of this unending watch. And we have lost our faith In all things, even our love. Laegaire. Conhor, you are a king, Speak to him as a master. Bid him leave this thing And be himself once more. Eithne (rising). Ay! Conhor. Use thy power, Thou glorious King of Ulster. Even at this late hour If thou shouldst speak to him in terms of thy high wrath He could not choose but listen. Smite the fiend he hath With thy authority. He shall not gainsay thee. [He bends over Cuchulain and takes him by the hand. Conhor. Cuchulain, man, wake! rouse thee! Laegaire. Nay, but lustily. Conhor. Wake! wake! After a pause.)My power counts little. You who loved him know He listened but to women, heeding nor friend nor foe For all he was our champion. These possessed his ear; Never our man's persuasion. If she move him not, Neither may I prevail to counterwork their plot. After another pause.) O, pitiful Cuchulain! What fool's fate is thine, Thou mirror of our nation, our sun's self, which did shine Like daylight on the world, and drawing all to thee! How is thy pride departed; the fair witchery Of thy high hero's courage, and thy manly face, Which was all Ireland's glory, Alban's sore disgrace, Beloving and beloved! Hast thou forgot thy deeds, Thy battles, thy strong shoutings, thy delight in steeds, The clamouring of thy clansmen and the clash of spears? Sualtim's son, bestir thee. Be as in past years. The day is gone for sleeping. Rise, man. To your arms. Your chariot waits. Laeg calls you. Hark to his alarms. The foe is at the ford! [Cuchulain moves restlessly, waving his arms. Laegaire. He seems to wake, to hear. He clutches for his sword. O, wise philosopher! Speak louder to him, Conhor. Lugaid. By the powers of hell He shall not now escape us. Rouse him with a yell Such as he heard in Connaught. [They all shout. Cuchulain half rises, staring around him angrily. Then his eyes close and he falls back. Eithne. He is beyond relief. He falls back to the darkness. O my grief! my grief! [She goes out weeping. Conhor. It is no use. He sleeps more soundly than before. Lugaid. He mocks us, for he heard us. Laegaire. Ay, he heard our roar As a wolf hears the hunters in his far-off den, And bares his teeth an instant, yawns, then sleeps again. He is beyond our rousing. Conhor (drawing the curtain). Leave him to his sleep. Your noise shall not prevail, or haply make you weep If he should rise in anger. Where is his wife? Lugaid. Not here. At Dundealgan is she. We sent a messenger, But she will hardly come. She is a woman proud, And will not face this other. Conhor. Eithne? Laegaire. 'Tis the cloud In her high heaven. She sits and waits the end apart, Not here at Emain Macha. Conhor. She has a mighty heart, And has forgiven him much, and once he loved her well. Love's memories lie close. Where they are housed they dwell. Laeg. Ay! Emer is no babe. Her will for war or peace Had ever a strong edge, and will not let her cease Till she has gained her end—a woman passionate, And fair, and masterful, either in love or hate. Conhor. Ay! a supreme, fair woman,—and his wife. Time was She clung to him, his shadow. Whereso'er he went She followed unreproved, beloved, obedient, And yet commanding him. How often have I seen The two in their first courting on the hurling green, He godlike in his skill, she rapt and watching him, Intent upon his triumphs, and with strained eyes dim With the thrill of victory. The long day through she sat, Made glorious by her love, his arbiter and fate, To give him praise or counsel. I have seen her, too, Handing him spears in battle while the javelins flew Around them like a hail, both at death grips with men Sublimely overnumbered, as of one to ten, Yet victors in the fight, where each took glorious toll. He feared her while he loved, and both were as one soul, A noble apparition. Later a change came. He was a man, inconstant. Spite of his great name, He stooped to things inglorious. Foolish loves he had With foolish, pretty women, whom his fame drove mad, And who must tempt him from her. She was high-born, proud. She scorned to be their rival. Silently, calm-browed, She stepped back from his life. He went alone to war. Yet she subdued him still, and brought him back to her, Twice, thrice. There was a savage tincture in her blood, Which always overcame. He fears her in this mood, And fear is kin to love, and both work miracles; For this 'twere well she came. Laeg. I hear her chariot wheels Already in the court. For certain she is there. (Enter Emer, who approaches them doubtfully.) Emer. Laegaire! Lugaid! The King! You sent for me, Laegaire? Laegaire. Ay, for we needed thee. Thy husband lies within, As thou well knowest, asleep; such sleep as is akin To sickness, on our hands. We are beyond our wit To cure him or to wait. See, lady, you to it, We yield him to your care. Emer. Who brought him to this house? Was it thy order, Conhor, he lies far from us, Thy order,—or what woman's? Conhor. Emer, none of ours. Thou knowest his mastering will, the strength which overpowers All impulse but his own. 'Twas his own headstrong choice, These dared not disobey nor raise a counter voice. They hid it from thee long. Emer. Too long. And where is she? Conhor. Eithne? She might not stand betwixt the sun and thee. She fled before thy coming as the wild dove flies Before the falcon's wing, nor thinks which way be wise So it escape her rage. There lies the man you love. She shall not vex him more, nor thee. Emer. Enough, enough. What is your Eithne to me, or all womankind, That she should fear to see me? Think you my peace of mind Is of such unstable stuff it should be over-set By a girl's folly, a man's fanciful regret For youthful joys remembered, and the sickly need Of a new maiden bosom for his aching head? Conhor, no more of this; pass on to larger themes. The man, your friend, lies here, by what foul stratagems Stricken I may but guess; the man, your champion, The bulwark of your State, Sualtim's glorious son, Foe of your foes, Cuchulain. What have you dared for him Who dared all for your help, who risked life, fortune, limb Each prodigal day for you? You hid him from me close, You grudged him to my care, in this unhallowed house. How have you proved your wisdom? You are a king of men: Did you command a cure? Are there no Druids, then, In all the land to serve you? Have the woods no charms, No herbs, no poison flowers, since harms are met with harms And poisons with more poison? Have you probed the hills For a wise omen, searched the seas to cure his ills? The Gods have many omens. Have you asked of them A single sign in prayer or clung to Nature's hem For a least alms of pity? Speak! Would you let him die? Away with you for cowards! Conhor. Emer, verily These waited while he slept. They deemed he would awake With the new dawn of summer, and arise and break His bonds as a bear roused. Laegaire. We watched and waited here Until our hearts were sick. Emer. Like crows a wounded deer! Nay, as brute sheep are you which on the hillside graze, Nor see more than the herbage on the mountain ways. His spear alone to you was worth a thousand spears, His shout all Ulster's shouting, his rage all its tears. And you sit on and watch. You, Conhor, are his lord: You stand and look at him and speak your royal word Of your high royal bounty—and go forth? Laegaire, You come here for your chess play. You, his charioteer, Laeg, drowse at his bed-head. You weep for him, Lugaid, As a man weeps with wine, and drink as to one dead. Are these the ways of men? Had it Cuchulain been, And you the slumberers, what wonders had been seen In every realm of Ireland! Not a Druid's skill But had been impressed to service—ay, against his will. If Fergus had been sick, think you the Hound's swift brain Had caught no remedy? If Connall had thus lain All Albion had been ransacked by Sualtim's son. Rise, Laeg, put wings upon thy feet, thou sluggard! Run Through hill and dale for help; press all men to his need. You shall not let him die. Laeg. Ay! Emer, we take heed; Yet art thou less than just. Emer. Justice is powerless here. 'Tis tyranny should rule. (To Conhor.)Be thou strength's messenger, And bring peace with the sword. Laegaire. Ay! Emer, with the sword. The thought is a man's thought. Thou hast thy woman's word More potent than our own. We go forth all for thee. Command us as thou wilt. Lugaid. Ay! go we joyfully. We leave him in thy hands. Conhor. Thou shalt keep watch and ward While we are in the mountains. If our quest be hard, Our zeal shall make it light. Only, do thou take heed. The man thou lovest is sick. He standeth in sore need, Beset by ills not human. There are shapes and shades We know of, yet see never, in the forest glades, And on the heaths and rivers deadly to us men. It needs a mightier power to drive them to their den Than only arms and courage—nay, than only love— Else had he long been rescued. Guard him close, and prove All comers with thy questions. Be advised. Who knows What spirits may appear, in what enchantments gross, To work his full undoing. Emer. Or to work him weal. The powers have sometimes pity. They have a hand to heal Where they have wounded; bring back strength, restore, make good Losses sustained through pain; earn human gratitude By more than human help. Conhor. Be politic with these, And know the good and evil of all fantasies. Lady, I kiss your hand. [Exit Conhor. Emer. I do not fear the spirits, Who lead a wiser life than our sad world inherits. Rather man's foolishness. Laegaire. We bid you our farewell. We will bring you back his cure, were it a herb from hell. I go with a light heart. Lugaid. And I. To the hills! Lugaid! Shout, brother, we are released, a shout to wake the dead! [Laegaire and Lugaid go out shouting. Laeg. Lady, I do thy bidding. Be thou circumspect. See where he lies within (half drawing the curtain). [Exit Laeg. Emer. (listening to the shouts outside). There go they, the elect, The warrior lords of Ulster. Peace be with their ways. Yet why should I say “peace,” since peace is a dispraise, And war their only pastime? They have watched too long, And are like boys let loose. They shout their battle-song Already in the street. I had need to wish them war; Fight to their hearts' content. And what a race men are! How small their practical worth! They have the thing we lack, The doggedness of will, to stand with a stiff back Against all odds of fear in a death-stricken field, And win the day or lose it—at least, not to yield— The rage themselves call courage. But beyond it, what? Nothing of any count. We weave the nobler plot Who are the strengthless women. What they spend we keep And build up in our souls, and half forget to weep. Only, our hearts betray us—always, utterly. [She goes to Cuchulain's couch, draws back the curtain and kneels by him. Settanta! My beloved. Dost thou hear me? See, I have come to thee at last, although thou wouldst not come. Hast thou forgot them, then, the pleasures of thy home, The faces of thy children, thy delight in all The fair things which were thine, which were a festival Each day to thee renewed? I am Emer, thy true wife, Who asks but to forgive thee. (After a pause.) O, my grief! my grief! He hears me not, nor knows. (After another pause.) Who brought thee to this pass, Man, that thou liest here, with thy sad, witless face All the sweet summer through? What women evil-eyed Have set their blight on thee? I do not blame their pride, Beloved, that they loved thee. But 'twas a foolish whim That thou shouldst love them back, be pitiful to them. Enough of this dissembling. Rise, Settanta, wake! It is summer in the hills. The wild swans on the lake Have every pair their brood. The does from lawn to lawn Crop the sweet grass in joy, and each one with her fawn. All are awake but thou, Settanta. (After a pause.)His eyes close. He is beyond my skill. He neither hears nor knows. [She buries her face in her hands. (Enter Fand, closely veiled, with doubting steps, as of an old woman.) Fand. Lady! Emer. What voice is thine that questions of my grief? Fand. One's who would bring thee counsel. Emer. Canst thou bring relief For a long, causeless ache, rekindle fires grown cold, Awake hearts worse than dead, and loves that have waxed old? Hast thou a remedy for ills that have no cure? Fand. I come from one that knows, and from a far-off shore, A friend to thee and thine. Emer. Nay, woman. Get thee hence! Begone! These have no need of thee, nor I of friends. Fand. Yet were it well thou listened. Lady, this disease Is not a common ill, but of those maladies Which are the gods' to send, the gods' to take away. I would share counsels with thee for his cure. Emer. Nay, nay. What know you of the gods? Fand. What those know who have seen. Emer. The gods have little pity on the sons of men. They live in their own world apart, their mountain tops, Their inaccessible mists, aloof from human hopes. They know not of our doings, and we know them not. Woman, hast thou their ear? Canst thou, too, haply float Upon the rain, and hear their voices in the wind? Hast thou held converse with them, thou of human kind? Thy words are idle phrases, and the gods are far. Fand. Yet are there others, lady, who more congruous are, And serve us to interpret. Mortal shapes have they, With men's own loves and passions, and less far away. They live with them unseen in every lake and rill— Ay, too, and in their homes as the invisible Co-partners of their lives. The great gods delegate Their sovereign power to these, and these control men's fate On sundry strange occasions. Wouldst thou not hear of them? Wouldst thou refuse their message? Listen, noble dame. The Sidhe-folk are his friends, and, as thou lovest, they love. They would not he should die. Emer. And their help's price? They prove Their pleasure to what profit? They will hardly give Their succour without payment. Fand. All the world must live. But these are generous givers, and their price is small. Emer. I dare not trust them. Nay, a blight is on them all: They are not of human blood. Fand. They are of human passion. They love and would be loved, but in less selfish fashion Than you with your mad lives. Yet are they ill to cross, And whoso mocks at them 'tis to his pain and loss. Lady, forbear your railing. Emer. And you? Who are you, Woman? Are you one of them that you hold the clue Of their designs? Fand. Grant me full audience. Let me speak. O gracious lady, listen. Fand with the fair cheek Is she that sent me hither. Fand, Manannan's Queen, Of the shores of Eoghan lord, and of the islands green Twixt Inbhir and the sea. Emer. Fand, daughter of Abrat? Fand. Ay, she of the pure eyes, the face which some relate Is as an unshed tear for its wise chastity. Ah! she is pure. How pure! All men she doth deny Who come to crave her grace. She looketh upon none, Though now for a year past Manannan, the sea's son, Hath gone forth in his ships and left her without guard. Yet pitiful is she. There is no wandering Bard, No Druid in the land, but asketh alms of her. She taketh delight in heroes. All things great and fair Move her to joy and pity—battle, glory, fame, Heroic feats of arms, the deeds that earn a name, The songs that win men's tears. Thou knowest, who art generous, The largeness of great bounty in an ungrudging house, The largeness of compassion. Long hath she known of thee And him who lieth here, and of his malady, Since she knows all; and lately she was touched with pity And sent me here, her angel, to this alien city, To help thee and to heal. And, lady, if thou please, I will put forth my power—as thus—on his disease, And cure him of his ill—as thus—and thus—and thus— [She makes magic passes with her hands which Cuchulain responds to in his sleep. And bring him to nemembrance of days glorious, And of his noble deeds and his great fame with men. And he shall be more a man twice told than he was then, For thee and for thy love. Yet only if thou will. See how my hands can move him. Emer. I mistrust thy skill. What is the price? The price? Thou art a woman old. How were it wert thou young? Shall I pour out my gold, My jewels, in thy lap? Fand hath her price? Fand. She hath. Only do thou, fair lady, keep an equal faith, Nor challenge us too strictly of our means and ways. We borrow him of thee. Emer. How so? Fand. For forty days. This is Fand's message to thee: In return for good, Thy hero being restored, with health and strength renewed, Grant him to fight with us against our enemies, Eochaid and Siabartha, who are Manannan's spies And leagued against her peace. But with Cuchulain's aid She shall be free from fear; and they too, and Labraid, Shall meet their men in battle and make discord cease. And so for forty days. Then shall he turn in peace, Fair lady, to your pleasure. Emer. Thou dost tempt me. Yet— Fand. Thou doubtest of my skill. Behold him in my net, A bird held by the fowler. [Cuchulain struggles on the couch. Emer. Stop! Do naught to him. You are not of our blood. Your purpose is too dim, Your face too full of meaning. You are a woman old. How were it were you young? My fears are manifold, My faith in thee a shred. Fand. Must he then find his death, Your hero? Nay, behold him; note his labouring breath, The darkness of his cheeks, his hands that clutch and strive. Have you no pity on him? Must he, then, not live? Emer. Yours is an evil presence. Fand. He has felt my power; He struggles with his sickness. It is the fateful hour! His life hangs on a thread, the word of our debate. Say, shall he live or die? Emer (aside). She is importunate, I know not what to think. It may be she is true. Fand. Speak, quick. His hour approaches. Emer. What, then, would you do? Fand. He shall be safe with me. His life as my own life, Ay, as the life of Fand. He shall not need his wife In one short glorious war which shall restore his fame And bring him back to you recaptured from all blame, A hero to your arms. Behold the dolorous man Laid on his couch of death; how pitifully wan, How frail a thing for you. We take him upon lease, Lady, to cure and save and yield him to your grace Ere forty days are done, a new man, sound and whole And worthy of your worship,—once more soul to soul, Body to body yours,—a man! Emer. She tempts me sore. The occasion is too great. Fand. Thou sayest? Emer. I give o'er. I leave him to thy skill. Deal with him as thou wilt. Only beware of failure. Yours shall be the guilt And yours the punishment if treachery there be, And a long arm of vengeance stretched remorselessly. Fand. I undertake the charge. At Baile's strand we will meet, And on the fortieth day. In glory or defeat Fand shall be there with him to win her thanks of you. Emer. I go back to Dundealgan in all faith. Fand. Adieu. [Exit Emer. Fand, alone, unveils herself.Forgive me, heaven, my guile! She is a noble woman. And I did not promise all; and promises are human, And die as mortals die. Ay, a most noble queen,— And yet a woman only. We who wear the green Have subtler hearts than theirs. They beat against the strings, These poor souls that must die, and strive and bruise their wings Like wild birds in a cage, and end by losing all. We are more wise who take life as a festival, And sing without a tear. A little tenderness Is all men want; not tears, not plaints, not ecstasies, Not anything discordant with their cup of pleasure. They had rather hear us laugh, however false the measure, Than listen to our griefs. For this men love us more And do our bidding better. She has lost her power Through over-wifely ways; and his too violent heart Rebels against her virtues. 'Tis the counterpart Of virtue that men prize,—not virtue's self,—the mock Of things divine and wise that gives the sentient shock These value in their passions. Yet there are times and moods When even we feel human, dire solicitudes, Resentments, angers, fears. Manannan angers me Beyond my natural heat. He has gone back to the sea And left me to my wrath, and now is leagued with those Who are my enemies, the Sidhe's ancestral foes. How sweet it were a vengeance!—and to love again! [She bends over Cuchulain, soothing him.Behold a man worth holding, a true king of men, Settanta, the beloved! How many hearts have beat To see him riding by with flower crowns through the street In triumph from the battle,—no man's face, but a god's,— Fighter and victor ever, and against all odds! What woman might withstand him? He lies here to-day A lion in my toils, my captive. I could slay Cuchulain with a word who slew the Connaught Kings. He trembles at my presence. To my eyes he clings As a child to its mother's skirt. His lips part with a cry. I could wake him with a touch; or I could let him die For lacking of a touch. This hour he is my own. Will he love me when he wakes? Who knows? Some hearts are stone; But not Settanta's. No. He loves a woman's face. Fand's he will not despise, nor rise up passionless. [She sings to him, waving her arms the while.He wakens and sits up and stares round him. Song —“ Beautiful Eyes Awake” Beautiful eyes awake! Undo the latchets of sleep. Be your lids unloosed, As winter is loosed from the hills When the forests tremble and quake, And the snow is poured from the rills, And the waters gather and grow, And the fountains and streams run free, And the lake's face brims in the sun, And the skies' unshepherded sheep Are noosed in the light of the noon— In the light of its life—ah, me! Awake! Be wise, and rejoice. There are things more worthy than sleep, Than the golden dream of thy soul, Than the words of thy lips in tune. There are things that shall leap and run, At the sound of thy conquering voice, On the day thou shalt wake from thy swoon And gather thy strength and arise. There are hearts that shall tremble and weep At the rush of thy conquering voice, At the sight of thy lips, thine eyes, At the tale of thy deeds to be, At the thought of thy strength—ah, me! Awake! Arise, and behold. The glory of earth and air Is a fair new kingdom won; The glory of lake and sea. By these shall thy deeds be told, By the maidens that braid their hair, With the locks and the crowns of gold; By the women that proudest are. They shall bow to thy conquering voice, They bow to their king to be; They shall kneel at thy feet—ah, me! For all women love thee—ah, me! A woman loves thee—ah me! Cuchulain. Where am I? Was it Eithne? Is it her house? Emain? Yet it was not Eithne's voice. It was like a sound of rain On the tree tops heard at noon. I have slept long in the heat. I need to be aroused, to rise and feel my feet, To stamp, to do some powerful thing with my hands, to shout. Yet I am weak; my voice is thin; I feel afraid, in doubt. I have been long sick here. I remember how it was; The sun's strength on my head where I lay in the grass By the yew tree at Baile's Strand; the women that were there, Beautiful, wonderful eyes, and a mad mass of hair, Like Dana the Earth Spirit. They struck me first in play, Then with a heavy hand, and then I swooned away In pleasure half and pain. (He calls.)Eithne! Fand (showing herself). She is not here. I wait upon your pleasure, fair son of Dechtire, To serve you and to honour. Shall I bring you aught? Milk, honey, lentils, mead? You have been long distraught. A draught to give you courage? Cuchulain. Ay, I will have mead. 'Tis always the best cure. A curse upon my head (trying to rise). It swims when I would stand. Fand. Let me support you. So. Lean on me—your full weight. 'Tis a mere nothing. Cuchulain. No. I cannot stand alone. My knees beneath me flinch Like a man's struck in the battle when the spear shafts pinch. Give me the mead, good soul. Fand. Come, one step forward. There! You are at your travel's end. Sit bravely in this chair While I pour out the tankard. Here is a flagon left By the roysterers that watched him—all thanks for the gift. [She pours out to him. Drink, noble Hound of Ulster—God confound your foes! [Cuchulain drinks, and she sits at his feet caressing him. Cuchulain. You are a kind sweet woman, fair as a wild rose With the dew of morning on it. (Playing with her hair. Fand. The mead has done you good. You are feeling like a man. (She kisses his hand.) Cuchulain. This is beatitude. I feel my courage rising. Soul of my life! I swear Your lips have given me strength. You are most sweetly fair, A woman of a thousand. Fand. Only one who is Your servant among women, in all kindnesses, Your servant, suppliant. Cuchulain. What, pretty, is your name? Fand. Men call me Fand. Cuchulain. How? Fand of the fair cheek? Fand. The same. Cuchulain. I have heard men speak of her. They say—what is it they said? They called you like a tear, a passionate tear, unshed, A single passionate tear—and they spoke truth. Fand. Alas! I would be a smile to please you, not a tearful face. Cuchulain. How came you to me here, sweet face? Fand. I came from far, And with a wish, a hope—half peace, and half of war. Of peace to heal Cuchulain. Cuchulain. The poor Hound. What more? Fand. Of war to ask his succour; since my need was sore, To win him to my side. Cuchulain. As what? Fand. A Champion To fight for me—and love me. And there was but one, Worthy of that—and this, in the whole land of Eire. Cuchulain. You speak, sweet, in no riddles. Fand. Truth is best. A fire Set on a hill brings help. And thou wilt help me. See I speak as to a god whom no hypocrisy Can argue into favour, truly as a god Who needs not our dissembling when we seek his nod, Nor any form of prayer save only “Grant thy grace, Do with me as thou wilt. But let me see thy face.” And I have seen Settanta's! Cuchulain. Thy god answers thee. And thou shalt be his goddess and thy champion he. How shall I help thee, Queen? On what far angry shore Shall I descend in wrath and drive thy foes before, Like wolves from their strong places? Shall I scourge the seas With my arm's flail, and pour my vials on the breeze Which circles Albion's shore. Shall I fire the eastern main? What new lands shall I conquer for thy sweet disdain? Fand with the passionate eyes; Fand with the fair rose cheek. Pour all thy soul in words! Nay, I conjure thee, speak! Whom shall I slay for thee? Fand. Settanta, none to-day; Let all the wicked live. They are not worth thy say; They are not worth thy rage. To-morrow thou shalt kill Men to thy heart's desire, and go forth terrible To all my foes and me. To-day I ask thee less; I am Fand, and at thy feet. Wilt thou love her? Cuchulain. Sweet one, yes. ACT II Scene.—The Garden of Abrat in Magh Mell. There are fairy trees and fairy flowers. A banquet is spread on one side of the stage. (A Chorus of the Sidhe. Liban and Fand conversing.) Song —“In the Land of the Living.” Chorus. In the land of the living are kingdoms twain, Kingdoms twain,—nay, kingdoms three; One of the gods and one of men, And one of the people who hold the glen. The happy people, of these are we, The ever-living, the Sidhe, the Sidhe.In the land of the living are kingdoms twain, Kingdoms twain,—nay, kingdoms three; One is of sunshine and one of rain, And one of the moonlight without a stain. The moonlight people, of these are we, The ever-happy, the Sidhe, the Sidhe. In the land of the living are kingdoms twain, Kingdoms twain,—nay, kingdoms three; One is of pleasure and one of pain, And one of the love which is loved in vain. The ever-lovers, of these are we, The happy people, the Sidhe, the Sidhe. Liban. And are you a happy lover? Are you happy Fand? Fand. The happiest woman, sister, of all fairyland. How were it otherwise? You see him what he is, A very prince of love and lord of happiness. A man is a better lover than our Sidhe-folk are, Because his heart beats faster. Whether in love or war, Cuchulain has the rage which is the life of things. Liban. He is less subtle, surely. Fand. He has imaginings Begot of human sorrow, which are beyond our wit, Beyond our subtlety. Men's joys are infinite Because their time is short. Joy has its root in tears. Liban. And does Cuchulain weep? Fand. He grieves for his lost years And for the years to come. Though he has loved so much He thinks he has never loved. He would have such and such A joy, lest time should rob him. He is in haste to reap The whole of his life's crop, and lay it in a heap As it were here at my feet, to-day and not to-morrow. This is his cause of grief. Liban. Heaven grant us all such sorrow. You are well venged of Manannan. Fand. Manannan? Where is he In all these happy ventures? I am released and free. Liban. Manannan was a fool, sister, to leave you thus. You are transformed, transfigured. Fand. O, I am glorious As a crane in her spring plumage. Who was it that said A woman should love once, and only once? Liban. Your head Has reason to be turned. It will be sad for you The hour when this shall end. Fand. Liban, what shall I do? The fortieth day is near. He has won his victory. His hero work is finished, fought out gloriously, And all my foes are captive, put to flight, or slain. I cannot keep him chained although he loves his chain. How shall I hold my word? I have promised, place and time, To yield him to his wife. Would failure be a crime Where time means happiness, for him no less than me? What is our rule of honour? May we not faithless be A little for love's sake? Liban. It is a doctrine hard That love should yield to aught. Yet must we keep our word. The Sidhe-folk do not lie. Fand. I will not grieve to-day, I am too light-hearted. No. Let grief come when it may, To-day I will laugh and sing. Liban. Sister, to laugh is best. We cannot know the future. Love should make its nest Only for one short spring, as the birds do who give Their whole souls to a moment. Fand. I will live and live As never woman yet, and when the time comes—then It will be time enough for tears. (Enter Laeg in haste.) Liban. Here comes our prince of men, Laeg, his good messenger. What news? Laeg. All well, all well. Liban. Labraid? Fand. Cuchulain? Laeg. All. I ran in front to tell The news of their safe coming, and they follow close. Fand. Laeg, tell us of the battle? Did he press his foes As fiercely as of old. Did his strength come to him? Laeg. O he was terrible. He stood there limb to limb With Siabartha wrestling, each a granite wall Leaning upon the other, grappling for a fall, Rigid as stone together till the last crash came. Liban. How came the fight about? Laeg. It was Eochaid's sole blame That brought the battle on and roused his bitterness. We had met Eochaid at the spring, who had stooped to wash his face, In jest at my lord's weakness, leaving one shoulder bare, While his fellows stood around him with a heedless air, Their heads thus on their hands (with a gesture of sleeping), as if to mimic sleep. They had heard of my lord's sickness, and they held him cheap, And laughed out in derision. But Cuchulain took Gay Bolg, his spear, from me and poised it till it shook Like a reed in the north wind, and with a sudden throw, Swift as a snake that strikes, ere she is seen, her foe, Sent it among them singing. Thus it was. The shaft Pierced Eochaid's shoulder through—ay, even as the hero laughed. Then on Cuchulain came an unappeasable wrath, Seeing we two were alone, with all these on the path, His and thy enemies; and round his head there shone The hero light of battle; and to each mother's son He shouted his defiance, words that were not words But biting points of steel. And all they drew their swords Who heard him, yet stayed not, and fled before his rage, While he pursued and slew. And no man dared assuage The fury of his anger till thy kinsmen came. And now they turn in triumph, each lord to his dame, And with them captive kings. But Senach stricken sore Fled down the road to death. He shall thee vex no more, He nor Eochaid nor Eoghan. Fand. O, sweet victory, O, day of all the days! There is none, Laeg, but he A hero in the world, since the great gods withdrew Apart to their lone mountains, angered at things new, And left men to their ways. Liban, they come, they come. Call all the women in. Bring garlands. Deck the room. Bid every minstrel play. To-day we triumph all, And celebrate their praise in one brave festival. Laeg, here is this for thee. [She gives him a gold chain from her neck. Liban. And are none hurt? Labraid? Has he come back unharmed? Laeg. Ay, even as I said, They are all here untouched, scathless of grief or ill. The foe before them fled as 'twere a miracle, All. Only Siabartha, whom Cuchulain broke Asunder in his arms as the storm rends an oak. Fand. And he, my lord Manannan? Laeg. Lady, Manannan waits The issue in his ships, guarding the eastern gates. The slain men were his spies. He will outlive their death, Being more wise than they. Liban. His sword clings to its sheath, Yet will he come in war. He has a heavy hand, Stronger than all the storms that are by sea or land. Laeg. Is he stronger than Cuchulain? Liban. He has the magic cloak, Stronger than love or death. Love yet shall be a smoke Before Manannan's ire. Fand has good cause for fear. Fand. I fear him not to-day, Liban. He is powerless here, In this fair mountain place, far from his fastnesses, Which all are of the ocean. Here his magic is Unskilled for mortal hurt, nor dares he face the green Of gardens watered thus, save as a shape unseen, And impotent to wound. The anger in his blood Would be but a faint tremor in our multitude. The sea is his dominion, and to-day, sweetheart, We will forget, forgive him. Liban. A sweet fool thou art, Deserving to be happy, and no martyrdom. Thou knowest not how to hate. Fand. Sister, they come! they come! (Enter a procession, Cuchulain, Labraid, and the army of the Sidhe, crowned with flowers. Prisoners in chains are with them. Fand and Liban advance and sing alternate verses.) Song —“Who is the Man?” Fand (singing). Who is the man I see, Set on his chariot of war, Beautiful, dark-faced, proud? His eyes as the eagle's are, His brow is a summer cloud, His smile is of victory. He hath looked on the lands afar, He hath scorn both of fool and wise. The man with the eagle's eyes Is the man I see. Liban (singing). Tell me, thou glorious one, Son of Sualtim, say, What are the deeds thou hast done? What are the deeds thou hast done? Where are the men thy foes, Thy foes who were foes to me? Thou art here in thy pride. And they? Not thou but the raven knows. When the battle was lost and won They were cast to the wolves a prey; There was left of them all not three, Not two, not a mother's son. Not one was there left to flee. Fand (singing). Hero! What women's eyes Rise in their tears for thee? The men they loved thou hast slain. Thy face is fairer than theirs, They shall weep till thou come again, The sun in their summer skies. They shall smile and forget their cares. Thou shalt kiss the tears from their eyes, Thy love shall have made them wise, They shall laugh, ay, loud in their glee, They shall laugh with me. [Fand makes show of kneeling at Cuchulain's feet, Liban at Labraid's, but Cuchulain kisses Fand's hand, while Labraid raises up Liban. Labraid. We greet you, ladies, well. The hour of home coming Is always war's best part, and the sweet smiles you bring That make our joy the keener. Liban! (He embraces her. Cuchulain (to Fand). I kneel to you. Lady of my soul (kissing her hands). Fand. Nay, nay. The hand-kissing is due To you alone, Settanta. Let me pay my debt (she kisses his hand) Thus here before them all, lest later I forget In my great joy to thank you. How should Fand not give Her worship to her champion, who first made her live, Alas, and made her love! [They all walk towards the banquet. Cuchulain (to Fand). In love there are no thanks, Whoever gives or takes; and the least generous ranks With the most glorious god in all he can bestow. Let us be happy, sweet, whatever debt we owe On this side or on that of unpaid gratitudes. To-day we will walk together in these scented woods, Holding each other's hands. Now to the feast. [They take their places at the table near the front of the stage. Labraid (seating himself with Liban under a canopy). My queen, You give a gay returning here for hungry men. Let us fall to. [Music plays, and there is a dance of Fairies. Chorus. In the land of the living are kingdoms twain, Kingdoms twain,—nay, kingdoms three; One of the slayer and one of the slain, And one of the kings that come back again. Of these are we, the victorious Sidhe, The ever-happy, the Sidhe, the Sidhe. Labraid (to Liban). Enough. Now send the flagons round For better entertainment. What mirth have you found To celebrate the day? Liban. There are two bards from Meath, But neither of much count. They wear the poet's wreath, But lack the poet's fire. A blind harper there is Better worth hearing from beyond the Eastern seas, And with him a fair youth, it is said, a messenger From Cathbad, the Arch Druid, one with with severe And finer flights of fancy than beseem his age, Master of recitation and high verbiage. Labraid. Let them be called. To-day we need a master's tongue To give praise to our guest. What matter he be young So the gods speak through him. Let him be called. [They seat themselves at the feast. (Drinking to Cuchulain.) To you, Cuchulain, valiant friend and war-companion true, Champion of Ulster, King, and of all Ireland first And noblest fighting man, we consecrate this thirst, The fruit of glorious toil. Fand. Settanta, to your praise. Liban. We drink to you, Cuchulain. Peace and length of days. Others. To you, to you, Cuchulain. (Enter Eithne disguised as a poet, followed by Manannan disguised as a harper. Neither of them is recognised by the guests.) Fand. What are these two, the boy, The old man?—a strange union. This one blushing, coy; The other a veiled spectre. Do you know them? Cuchulain. Nay. I seem to have seen the youth, but vaguely, far away— I have forgotten where. Fand. And the harper? Watch him close. To me he is familiar. Cuchulain. He is from Meath. Fand. Who knows? They came both strangers here. His eye is like a snake's, Which watches with lids closed and seems asleep, but wakes. Keep close to me Settanta. Labraid. Whence and what are you, Bards, who thus honour us where welcome is most due To sing at our high feast? Your name? Your lineage? (To Eithne.) You are young to be a poet. Eithne. Poets have no age. They are born of their own thoughts. Labraid. It is well said. And he? Eithne. His hand shall touch the strings. He shall strike gloriously, And you shall listen all. Labraid. What, poet, wilt thou sing? Eithne. That which the gods shall breathe into my ear. I bring No thought which is my own. Yet thou shalt listen. Labraid. Chaunt Thy praise of our high hero. We will reward thy vaunt. Eithne. Thou shalt have little pleasure. Labraid. Yet sing on. Eithne. Of thee? Labraid is monarch here. Labraid. As thou wilt, let it be. Cuchulain. His voice disturbs me strangely. To my ear it clings Like an enchantment, echoing remembered things, Ulster, Emain, my glory—dreams I had forgot. Fand. Do they still grieve thee then? Cuchulain. Nay, love, it matters not. It was an echo only. [Manannan strikes chords on the harp. Fand. Didst thou hear that? Cuchulain. The sound Of the harper's prelude searching till the words be found? Fand. It was the sea's voice calling. It was the sea that spoke, The black-surge of the shingle and the waves that broke In thunder on the beach. Cuchulain. I heard it not. It was To me like land winds wandering through the meadow grass. Fand. Listen. Eithne (sings, addressing Labraid). Song —“How shall I sing?” How shall I sing to thee, Labraid, Thou Lord Of the quick sword, Thou hero born? Upon this day of days My lays shall comfort bring, Even as the snows in Spring, The wind of ill, that blights the corn. They ask a song of thee, O soul of mine, A song of wine And joyous mirth, Thou raven in their path. The cup he hath That shall the poet fill. Nay, hide thy wrath, Thou seer of things divine. Bind thou thy locks unshorn, Fill high thy horn. They ask thy praise, With peace and length of days. Let loose thy tongue To a new stream of fire. Pay them their hire, Or leave thy songs in impotence unsung. Why spare them their amaze? Scourge thou their lips with scorn, With thorn on thorn. Peace! Who shall speak of peace? Who in the silences Shall cry with eyes outworn? Who calm their ire? Since man is the thing he is, Slave of a day's desire, Thrall of a woman's kiss, Breath of a serpent's hiss. Man, of a woman born. [They show signs of disapproval. Labraid. What meanest thou, young poet? This is a festal day. We asked thee for thy blessing, and thy verses play Like lightning on the rocks, a too discordant tune. This warrior is our guest. If thou wouldst ask a boon, We give thee all thy wish, so thou sing joyously. Who sent thee with this word? Eithne. From the high gods am I, And Cathbad, their arch-priest. Cuchulain (aside). Cathbad! What youth is here, Who dares to speak of Cathbad, his interpreter? I know that voice, that eye. Fand. Whose? Do they anger thee? Cuchulain. Their menace cannot harm. But there is sorcery In the boy's voice, a trouble which I needs must share, And makes me sad at heart. It is ill to leave the air Where one was suckled. Fand. Thou art weary grown of us. Thou lackest thy companions, thy days glorious With thine own human kind. Thou art weary grown of all. Cuchulain. Not weary, sweet, of thee,—but of this festival. What was his word of Cathbad? Fand. There is a presence here More potent than the boy's. Cuchulain. There is thunder in the air. It is the sea-storm gathering. Labraid. Young poet, sing again, And put aside thy sorrow for the sons of men. The high gods do not grieve. They have no cause for tears, Being aloof from time and the avenging years, Even as we the Undying. Eithne. They are aloof from that Which is more fierce than time. They neither love nor hate, They are absolved of passion and the turbulent sting Of that which hurries man to his own undoing, Even as you the Undying?—Out and alas, Labraid, Can you see nothing here? Are your eyes so in shade That you see nothing? Nothing? Labraid. What, then, dost thou see? Eithne (then turns to Cuchulain, who becomes troubled while she sings). Song (continued). I see a flame of fire On the hill, The trees aglow. When the breeze was still It was lit by the hand of a child, By the guile of a woman's will, The wile of a woman that smiled, And a man's desire. Woe to the forest, woe! I see a man among men, Proud of his might In fight When the trumpets blow. Who shall withstand his ire? He is bound as a hound with a chain. He is bound to a stranger's eyes. Fool is he that was wise. He has earned his hire. He shall go where they bid him go. [They rise and expostulate. Cuchulain. It is Eithne and none other. What would she seek here? Fand. Eithne? A woman? Cuchulain. Ay. Fand. What is she, then? Cuchulain. A seer. Fand. A woman who once loved thee? Cuchulain. Hush! She begins again. It is to thee she turns. Fand. Ay. As a soul in pain. Eithne (turns to Fand and sings). A fair woman's face I see. Is it a rose, or snow, Or a tear is she? Nay, but the rose is a briar, The snow is trod in the mire. Her lover is proved a liar. And the tear? Ah, me! The sweet, sad, pitiful tear Of the eyes that know. Woe to the woman, woe! [The whole of the company rise up in indignation against Eithne. Fand and Cuchulain interpose on her behalf. There is tumult on the stage, and Manannan raises his harp high above his head, as if imposing silence. A low sound of thunder is heard. Fand (who alone recognises him). Manannan! ACT III (At Baile's Strand. Emer with her women attendants armed. They are grouped beneath a yew tree. All around is desolate. A view of hills, the sea hard by.) Emer. This is the place, Baile's Strand—and time—the fortieth day, Since he went forth with her—that sorceress—on his way To his new mad adventure. Yet it was best. My mind Is confident of this, and he will come back kind, And eager as of old. How glorious the world is, Clothed as it is to-day, with these glad promises, In spite of the black winter. Winter is best for us Who are no longer babes—ungraced, but glorious With its wild gleams of joy illumining the sea. To-day he will return. This thing she promised me, A home-coming to-night—who knows, a honeymoon, In spite of my fool rivals. See you none coming? [She looks towards the sea. Attendant. None. The sea mist drives too thickly. Emer. Nor on the moor? Hard by! Now, surely there were voices? Attendant. It was the plover's cry. Emer. Your ears are dull to-day. My own are prescient Of something brave at hand, of a new grand event, Which shall repay all sorrows. What was it she said, That crone, for my consoling while I watched his bed In the Speckled House and wept? A wise wife wins, it was. A wife wins against all, and all things come to pass For her that shall have patience. The rest come and go, Are smiled on, and pass smiling; but the true wife; no, She triumphs in her tears;—and in the end he lays His tired head in her lap, and turns on her his face, Though it be only dying. If I could hold him thus, At last, if only thus! Attendant. There is one approaching us, A woman and alone. Emer. A woman? Old or young? Attendant. Her path is from Emain. She has let loose her tongue, And calls to us aloud. She is weeping. Emer. Who is she? Attendant. Nay. It is one we know. It is Eithne. Emer. Let her be. You shall not speak to her. What does the woman here, Thus once more on my path, to stand my challenger In face of all, and him—and on this day of days? I hate the girl's white face and her fair love-sick ways, And her mad songs and tears. Stand close. (Enter Eithne, who is walking wildly as if in a dream.) Eithne. Have you seen him? Attendant. Whom? Eithne. The man who is bewitched, your hero. Is there room For more than one in the world? Cuchulain. Of your grace, Friends, tell me of Cuchulain. Emer. Woman, hold your peace. There are none here your friends. Eithne. I have seen it in the air. There has been a battle lost. He won once. I was there. I saw him smite Eochaid and the confederate foes, And later, in his triumph. But to-day, who knows? Look at the eagles soaring. Emer. Pass upon your road. We have no news of a fight. For evil or for good, Pass on your road. Away! Eithne. I fear harm by the sea, If he should have met Manannan. His first victory Was in the hills afar, where the King's power was weak, But here Manannan rules. He has the strength to wreak His vengeance on Cuchulain, since he knows all. Emer. All? How? Eithne. Manannan rules the sea. The storms before him bow As servants to his nod. He has the magic wand That brings them in their cohorts thundering on the land. None may withstand him here. Emer. And he seeks what? Eithne. His wife, Who has defied his power, and is a cause of strife In all the Fairy realm to all the world—and thee. Emer. To me. I will not listen. Pass on thy way. Eithne. Nay, see The eagles overhead. They watch death from afar. It shall be a day of trouble. Emer. Go, then, seek thy war. But trouble me no further. Out of my sight, begone Ere it be worse for thee (threatening her). Eithne. Nay, I go quickly. Emer. Run. Lest I should smite thee, girl. Eithne (frightened). Ah, whither? Emer. Where thou wilt. Follow thy birds, not me, lest thy fool's blood be spilt, For my wrath rises at thee. (Aside.)Yet my mind misgives. She presages an ill. (To Eithne.) The man you look for lives. Follow your birds. Away! Eithne. I will go down to the sea And watch for what befalls. Emer. Ay, and go warily. If Manannan be abroad. (Exit Eithne.)She, too, is on the quest Crazed with her love of him, her heart sore like the rest, Ready to kneel; to adore. Yet, why should we thus make Our lives a cup poured out for men's mad pleasure's sake. This Eithne is a fool. But the wisest wins no more Than just her stake, their tolerance. We all count it store If we can hold them with us for some years in chain— Some years, some months, some days. Our wisdom is in vain. They always are our masters, since love binds us still, And we wait on, their slaves, rough ride us as they will, Hating each other for it with an insensate hate. O, women, you are fools. And yet, and yet, and yet— Settanta comes to-day. (To Attendants.) Is there still nothing? There! That was a strain of music, not far off, an air Like the Fairy chaunt, most sweet, yet ominous withal. They are bringing him in triumph. Attendant. It is a festival. They are coming from the hill. Second Attendant. A single voice it is; A single woman's voice. Attendant. I hear the cadences Of another with her, a man. Emer. It is his voice. (Fand is heard singing.) And hers? It is not Eithne's. Listen. See that no one stirs A hand or foot to them. Closer, I bid you, maids. I bid you closer yet and hide you chattering heads. We will watch them as they come. [They stand behind the tree. (Enter Cuchulain and Fand as lovers. She scatters flowers of faery, singing as they walk. Laeg follows at a distance. and remains in the background as they advance.) Fand (sings)— Song—“ O the Days that are Done.” O the days that are done, The days of the fading summer, Brown leaves and days of brown, Loves that are scattered and flown With the whirling leaves from the tree, When the rain is on land and sea, And the white mists have hid the sun From the face of the sad newcomer. Cease, O rain, from thy tears. Laugh, winter. I bring thee roses. Why dost thou weary our ears, Wind, with thy insolent jeers? For lo in love's path I strew Bell-flowers and bind-weeds blue, And poppies to ease love's fears, And ever and always roses. (She offers him an apple of love, and sings again.) Apples of love, how sweet, Love, for thy sake I gather. Who that of these shall eat, Love's guidance shall guide his feet, Love's lightning shall blind his eyes, Love's wit shall have made him wise, Since laughter is all love's meat. And tears shall assail him never. Cuchulain. Is this the tree you spoke of? Fand. It is the tree of Fate, The goal where all love ends,—a little desolate, A little dark and sombre,—like a day that was, And cannot be again. Cuchulain. I do not love its boughs. Fand. Yet we shall laugh to-morrow. Cuchulain. We will away from it, I will not be made sad. Time shall not part us yet. Fand. We are time's slaves, not masters,—even we who ride Like kings upon his back, in our joy glorified. Time bears us royally, but only at his will. Here he has stopped with us and points towards the hill, And bids us down afoot. We have been happy, love, Too happy to lament, or weep, or argue of, As if love were eternal and our souls our own. (Sighs.) Ah, love is not eternal. (After a pause.) You will remember Fand, Who was so sweet to you awhile in a strange land, And gathered shells with you, white shells by the lake's shore, And strewed flowers at your feet, and loved you, alas, more Than ever she loved man. Cuchulain. Now, by the powers that are, This parting shall not be. Be the day near or far, We will go on together and confront our fate. We will love on for ever. Fand. Love? It is too late. I dare not fail your Emer or be false to her. This is the tryst I named her, and the hour is near; 'Tis now that we must part. Ah, if indeed she knew, She would forgive. Your Emer! She is wise and true, The first of womankind, as you, alas, of men. Cuchulain, have you loved me? Truly? Once again Kiss me before we part (they embrace). There, I put on this veil (veiling herself) And hide myself in ugliness, lest my resolve should fail. I am now another woman—one she would approve And whom you could not kiss. Cuchulain (drawing aside her veil). Not yet an instant, love. I dare not lose your beauty.'Tis my strength, my life! Fand. And thou who art my strength! It were well to be thy wife And not as thus, immortal,—and so lose thee. See, There are real tears in my eyes, the first Fand's vanity Has ever shed for man. Cuchulain. We will away, sweetheart, And dwell in your high mountains with your gods, apart From men and their sad ways. Ah, Fand, I love these tears Better than all the laughter of your glad god's years, Though those, too, were my glory. Fand of the fair cheek. Fand of the passionate eyes. Fand. Fand. Speak to me still. Speak. Tell me in words you love me once more ere I go (they embrace). I will never more love mortal. Cuchulain. Nor I woman. No; Never while life shall hold me. [Emer advances. Cuchulain and Fand start apart, Fand veiling herself again hurriedly.Laeg places himself between them and the Attendants. Emer. Cease. This shall not be. Cuchulain, stand aside. (To Fand.)What means this mummery, This fooling, this disguisement of a treacherous face? Off with these lying weeds! They hide not your disgrace. I have seen all and I know. (She tears off Fand's veil.) Cuchulain. Mad woman, hold thy hand. This lady is protected. Emer. She is revealed. 'Tis Fand. Fand's self, and not another—not Fand's messenger, But just Fand's wanton self. Woe and alas for her! Woe for our womanhood! What was it that she said Of the fair Fairy wisdom, the high lives they led, These queens upon their mountains, nobler than our own? The brave immortal part played by the gods alone Transcending our poor virtue? Fand, in the open day, Stealing our heroes' hearts, as gold is stolen away, And robbing their lean wits, till they are such as he, The man who stands beside her! Fand with her chastity! Fand with the flower-like eyes! Fand with the pure proud face! Fand like a tear unshed! O, these bold goddesses! How like are they to women! [Emer rushes on Fand with a dagger. Cuchulain seizes her arm. Laeg interposes between them and the Attendants. Cuchulain. Emer! Once more have done. This is no place for brawling. Wenches, every one Stand back—or fear my hand. Laeg. Back, maids. Have you forgot The terror of Cuchulain? Nay, I warrant not, Or must Laeg teach it you? To your distaffs, girls, away! (Laeg drives them out, and they fly screaming.) [Exit Laeg and Attendants. Cuchulain (alone with Emer, Fand in the background). Now, by the name of him by whom I swear, to-day Shall see an end of it between us two. What rage Is this that hath beset thee? Am I, then, in cage, Like a tamed wolf, with thee that thou shouldst hold me cheap And dare me to my wrath? What harvest wouldst thou reap With thy mad herd of women set thus on my track, And thy insane weak hand and the innocuous wrack Of thy vain railing words? Put down that childish steel. Its violence does thee wrong. Emer. Wouldst thou, then, see me kneel At my foe's feet, Settanta? Cuchulain. I would see thee make Thy face fair to my friends. Nay, coil thee like a snake; Thou shalt not master me. Emer. Settanta. (They struggle for the dagger.) Cuchulain. Cast it down, Then we will argue it. I care not, smile or frown, So thou obey. Emer (yielding). I will obey, Cuchulain. There. I do it at thy word. It flies a messenger (throwing away her dagger) To thy foes slain for thee, how many, in past days, To tell them I repent; that henceforth Emer's ways Are the ways of a weak girl, of one who strikes no blow Even for the man she loves. It is gone—and let it go— And with it love and hatred and all pride in thee. Thou hast enough of maids to soothe thy vanity. Be they henceforth thy safeguard. I am absolved of all. Cuchulain. Emer. Emer. I am not thy wife. I am thy slave, thy thrall, Even as these others are (kneeling).I kneel to thee. I kiss The ground beneath thy feet, like them, in ecstacies, Entreating and cajoling; lies upon my lips And flatteries on my tongue; false to the finger tips. Is thy wrath satisfied, thou great Sualtim's son, Thou hero of the world, thou scourge of Albion, King of all kings—Cuchulain? It is a helot sues, No wife to war with thee, to claim rights, to abuse Thy too long patience tried. I am thy concubine To weep tears on thy bosom; one so wholly thine As to laugh when thou shalt strike her. Strike and thou shalt see. Cuchulain. Emer, enough, rise up. I may not strive with thee. Thou shalt have back thy weapon, were it but for Ferdiad's ford, Where we two stood at bay, thy dagger and my sword, We two against all Connaught. Only do thou stay on Gentle as once thou wert. What evil have I done So great that thou shouldst flout me? This one is a queen, As worthy as thyself; nor shall she stand between Thy pride and our long love, since thou art first and best, And a man's heart has needs besides his earliest. I will call back thy women. [Exit. Fand. Ah! He loves her still. Emer. He is subdued and won. His wrath was terrible, Yet shall his love make light the anguish of his hand— And I—I am weak—weak—weak— Fand (advancing). What would you, then, of Fand, Lady, of more account than Fand would freely give? There was no need of menace, of wild words that grieve, Of the least ungenerous thought. Gladly would Fand consent To all your asking. Nay. Him you so nobly lent She came but to restore. Were it her heart's best blood You should desire of her, 'tis Fand would make it good, 'Tis Fand that would bestow. Emer. Why did you take this man, If you so little loved him, for so brief a span— This man of all mankind? It is an ugly trade To steal love from another, be you wife or maid, And you, bride of Manannan. Why have you done this thing? Fand. Ah, lady, you have said it. Manannan is a king, Glorious, and to be feared, and once I loved him well. I came to him a bride, his chosen one. A spell He wrought on me to love him, though he in truth was old And I a child in years, with gifts and manifold Persuasions of fair words. But now he loves me not, And lives apart and far, and I am clean forgot, And see his face no more. Brave suitors came to me How many, with their loves? Yet I loved chastity More than them all, and said them nay, how oft, how long Nor would I be consoled, though I had suffered wrong, Until the day you know of. Then I heard of him, Your hero who was sick, and idly in a whim Of pity I came to you. We Sidhe have a rule To love anew each Spring, and I was named a fool For my long continence, and when I saw his face I knew his cure lay only in my arms' embrace, And my cure in his arms. If I did wrong to you, See, I repair it well. I give you your full due, Your hero sound and whole. Emer. And is that all your creed? Is that your Fairy wisdom? For one evil deed To do a deed more evil? For a love disdained To take another love, and count the loss regained? How is your anger vanquished? How is your grief avenged? Does your wound hurt you less because your bed is changed? Can pain be cured by killing? Out on your Fairy faith. Fand. Emer, we are not as you, who have not, as you, death To be our full consoler, nor the calm of age To make our griefs grow less and our sick souls more sage. We may not be thus fixed who are for ever young, And so for ever sentient. He who does us wrong Needs at our hands, and swiftly, his full punishment, And we, who grieve love lost, to be less innocent, Lest we should weep eternally eternal tears. And so our loves grow wanton. You, with your short years, May dare more constancy. We always must forget, Nor venture to love wholly, lest we smart for it Beyond our power to endure. Our loves are like the flowers We gather in your meadows in our idle hours And hold them in both hands, and yet as soon let go. 'Tis on their scent we live, the sweetness that we know Too well to leave untasted. Time is full of blossoms, And full of wild sweet loves we press to our sad bosoms, And are revenged and happy and find life again. Your world is our rose garden and its flowers your men. I did not mean to wrong you. What shall I say more? Emer. And you now love him? Fand. Surely. Yet think not therefore I am less true to you. You are a happy woman, A woman happier far than I who am less human. I would not keep him from you. He is yours to-day— To-night—I promised it; and I will go my way Where none shall learn to follow, and so keep my word. Alas, my grief, my grief! (She weeps.) Emer. Nay, I forgive having heard. And women need forgiveness. We are all weak. We stand, We two, like children lost in a bewitched strange land, The land of one man's heart, where we alone are kin. I grudge you nothing. Nay, why should my heart begin Its thankless toil anew of weaving the mad wind, Less wild than a man's heart, and when it goes more kind? Let me be given up. Fand. Not so. Indeed, not so. I will not stand before you. What is my small woe To your wife's right of grief? It must come in the end. I go upon a journey where no soul shall lend Its voice of comforting; but time cures all, And our time is eternal, one long festival, Where the guests come and go and none of them sits long. Long love proves a long weeping and a longer wrong. (Aside.) Yet it is pity you, Emer of the yellow hair, Should leave Fand to her sorrow, and take all her share. (Re-enter Cuchulain, Laeg, and the Women in disorder.) [Fand retires to the back of the stage. Cuchulain (giving Emer her dagger). Here, take your plaything back. It yet may serve a need If that be true these tell. What is it, Laeg, they said? Attendant. We have seen shapes and shadows terrible to men. Hands which have struck at us. The sea mist in the glen Is full of an armed host with tongues that mock at us And eyes that flash defiance. There are sounds ominous Of hurt in every tree, and angers which speak loud. Hark! Heard you not the thunder? Laeg. There is a mighty cloud That broods upon the sea and seems a living thing, A shadow of destruction. Fand (aside). It is himself, the King, Manannan, in his wrath! He has come to claim his own. [Darkness. A loud thunderclap is heard.Every one starts aside. Cuchulain. Laeg. To your arms! Stand fast! What was that presence here? I felt it on my face, and 'twas no gossamer. It swept me like a bough. To your arms, Laeg, and strike home! Take that, and that, and that. [He strikes at phantoms in the air, and they both rush about fighting. Women. We are lost! A Terrible Voice. Fand! Fand! Fand. I come. [The storm dies away. Fand disappears. Cuchulain. The storm is past,—take courage,—and the foul spectral host With its lewd apparitions. Is none strayed or lost, Emer, of all your women? Emer. No one of the band. We are all here. Laeg. Save one. Cuchulain. What mean you? Where is Fand? Where is the Queen? Speak out. Emer. There was a voice that cried Aloud to her to come, and would not be denied: “Fand! Fand!” I saw her turn, and with her lips apart, In the great darkness, standing thus, her white hand on her heart. She seemed to fade and vanish. Cuchulain (to Emer). Woman. What is this? What hast thou done with Fand? Are these thy sorceries? Are these thy jealous doings? Emer. It was Manannan's voice That called on her to follow; and the rest her choice. She has gone back to the sea with him. She has chosen her lot. Cuchulain. Was I not here, Cuchulain? Nay. She loved him not. Why should she follow him? It is thy jealous guile Has driven her out from us. She would not waste a smile On all the proud Sidhe Kings that ever kneeled to her, Manannan or another, or one precious tear From her sweet flower-like eyes on the unpitying sea. Why should she seek its bosom? Why should she fly from me? If you have raised this route, Emer, by Him that is, You shall see my face no more. Women, take heed of this: If Fand be not restored there shall no more be seen A lady in this land to be beloved of men, Nor any save the reprobate. My hand shall take Such toll upon you all, such vengeance for her sake, That you shall grieve you lived. Away with you! Away! Search by the seas and shores, probe every cape and bay, And inlet where she lies;—nor come with her again Save as her slaves and servants. Laeg. It has turned his brain, He has grown mad. [Cuchulain is driving them out when Eithne enters, carrying a cloak. Cuchulain. What! A new woman, and not Fand? Women, you are triflers all, and this is a mad land. Away, with you! Away! Eithne. He has forgotten me. Emer. Speak to him, Eithne, straight, lest he do injury. Have you seen no woman pass? Eithne. My grief! I have seen the king, Manannan of the sea, with his fiend-following. There was tempest on the beach, and a black multitude Of shapes upon the waves and cloud which fought with cloud, And storm-wind with more storm. Emer. No woman? Eithne. There was a queen Passed down towards the shore new-clothed in the Sidhe green, And fair, exceeding fair. Emer. What did she? Eithne. She was singing As those sing who are glad, and to the King's robe clinging As those cling who are gay and ask what all men give. Cuchulain. Traitress! She smiled on him? You did not hear her grieve? Eithne. The King looked down at her, and her eyes met his eyes, And she stopped short in her song, and the tears seemed to rise An instant to her lids, and her eyes looked like flowers With raindrops on their petals when they are caught in showers And the sun shining still. Then with a sudden whim, Even as he stooped to kiss her, she snatched his cloak from him— This cloak—and broke away with her white feet to the sea, Laughing a childish laugh, to where I stood, while he, Pale in his rage, stood there and cursed as she fled on Unharmed to the sea's brink, spite of his malison. And passing me she dropped the mantle, while they all Pursued her through the waves which rose to meet them tall As a ship's side, it seemed,—or may be 'twas a ship Tall as a wave. And there the whole dark fellowship Mounted in haste with her, while the mist shut them in, And the wind's roaring drowned their voices' impotent din, Which suddenly grew still. For she, as she left the cloak, Cried, “Shake it in their faces.” And I stood up and shook The robe as she had bidden, and the ocean's roar Ceased, and the waves dropped down and fawned upon the shore, Like spaniels at the lash, while through the silence came A last word of command, and she named Cuchulain's name, And cried, “Go back to him and tell him, with my kiss, It is Manannan's robe of full forgetfulness. Shake it before Cuchulain; it shall cure his hurt.” Laeg. It is the robe of power, Manannan's magic shirt, The healer of all sorrow. Cuchulain. Were it a robe of death, Yet shake it in our faces. That which quickeneth Shall it not also kill? Emer. Ay, Eithne, for us all, We need it sore each one, since each of us is thrall, Of his own happier past, which asks to be forgot. Shake it in all our faces. Shake it. It matters not Whether it was good or evil, pain or lesser pain. The past is only sorrow.—O to begin again With a clean memory, purged alike of love and hate! Cuchulain. We are grown weary all, and death is to forget. [Eithne sings, waving the cloak slowly to and fro, and becoming more animated in the last verses. At the end of verse two the stage, which has gradually become lighter, shows full sunlight, while the countenances of all grow gay. Song—“Away, thou Thief.” Away, thou thief Of the world, Grief! Tears, away, both of pain and pleasure! We have had enough Of the things of love. We have weighed our days, and have proved their measure. For Love, the master, Has brought disaster, Through running faster Than feet could follow. Our need is grievous He here should leave us, To dream without him in hill and hollow. Better it is, In a world like this, Where years deceive, and no day is sure. Where Love is cruel, And friends are fuel, To end than mend what we cannot cure. For Love, the master, Runs ever faster, And brings disaster On all that follow. Why should he grieve us? Nay, let him leave us, To breathe more freely on hill and hollow. Shine sweet sun, On a day begun, As of childhood won from the ways of sorrow. All that was pain Has become our gain, Like a night of rain on a cloudless morrow. For Love, the master, Has brought disaster, Through flying faster Than feet could follow. Here shall he leave us, Since need is grievous Of rest more blest upon hill and hollow. This cloak I shake On the eyes that ache, They shall sleep, then wake to a new sweet silence. The storm's distress In forgetfulness Shall grow less and less in life's wiser islands. For Love, our pastor, No longer master, Shall bring disaster On none that follow, Nor he deceive us As once, nor grieve us, While we go free over hill and hollow. Curtain.

Time, 7th Century, A.D. ACT I Governor's Palace at Alexandria Alexis, a young man, a dandy, is seated alone at his desk looking through official correspondence. He opens a private letter languidly, then, with a look of vexation. Alexis. It is time I made a change. My father says it. Yes, It is folly to go on. Love holds me less and less, And I am tired of all life gives us in that way. These Alexandrian maids amuse one for a day. But there are things in life of larger interest Even than unbought love, the passionatest and best. I am tired of Jael's tears. It is always the same tale, I know it every word—the indestructible Devotion of her soul—it always is her soul— To an ideal man, sublimely beautiful, Sublimely wise and good,—and christened with my name, In compliment, no doubt, to all that I least am, With hints that I should wed her. Yes, I know it all— Her raptures, her remorses, the things past recall, The hardness of my heart, the vow she now will make Of being a fool no more—with firm intent to break. Her letters! Oh, I know them. I want something fresh, A new sea for my nets, and those of larger mesh. New worlds to win—male worlds—not women's. (Reads the letter.) Ah, just so, Exactly as I thought—“a new absorbing woe, Added to all the rest”—“a last and fatal stroke Which separates our lives.” No, no. She is in joke. She talks of “an espousal,” of herself as “bride.” To whom? To what? Good heavens! Religion? Suicide? What does the woman mean? But I am “to hear all soon, On Monday next.” To-day! This very afternoon! Here! At the Prefecture, in my “official heaven”— What monstrous foolishness—“in hope to be forgiven If she still claims my aid.” I understand this word, But she will not find me here. The nest without the bird, That is our wisest course in cases of the kind. And yet it worries me, her marriage? Am I blind? Who, who can the man be? If she should prove untrue, This Jael after all? O women! None of you, Not one of you then constant! Even Jael! No, no; It would be too base of her,—though perhaps better so. But see, my father comes. (Enter Barix, announced by Servant.) Servant. The Prefect, sir. Barix (heartily). Dear boy. I find you at your desk. This is indeed a joy. You will live to be my comfort. Well. What news? Yes, yes. Our famous draft is ready? Alexis (looking puzzled). Which? Barix. His Highness'? Our note to the Makawkas. (He takes up Jael's letter.) Alexis. No sir. No, not that. This is the document (giving another paper). Barix (reading). In high affairs of State Use the third person. Right. The Makawkas is a prince With whom we can do much by show of deference. Yes, a good draft, quite good. (In a pompous voice.) I think we have made clear Now, even to their dull wits who read the circular, That Rome must be obeyed. How childish it all is, Alexis, after all, this prate of policies, This tenderness for forms and antiquated shams, When all the force is ours. We have played too long with names; It is time we came to facts. A veiled authority Was well in the past years. But now with this decree We shall take stronger ground. Rome has too much on hand To trifle with loose ways of action and command, Too high a duty. Here in Egypt more than all We need to prove our strength, to be equipped, like Saul, Taller than all our brethren, with the actual show Of kingship in the world—since Heaven has willed it so, And given us this high mission for the world's more good. Rome's task will be achieved with the whole Nile subdued, Its tribes reclaimed to law, its wealth to revenue, Its idle hands to toil. Here is good work to do For all our officers. Alexis. Good work, yes, and good pay. Barix. Good trade, too, for Rome's millions clamouring day by day To Caesar for more bread. And Caesar's will must wait Forsooth on the Makawkas! the machine of State, On the dull childish whim of a blind Coptic prince, Sad phantom of the Pharaohs, left us for our sins By the too tender conscience of Heraclius! No, no. This draft shall teach them that no noise nor fuss Can drive us from our course of large humanity Towards a suffering world. Alexis, they shall see That Barix overbears. Alexis (aside). He does it well. Barix. There, there, You shall take it him yourself. It will need all your care To get the Prince to sign it. Though his wit is dense, He is apt to be suspicious. Give him the general sense, Or read it in translation—an old trick, but one That very seldom fails if at all deftly done. It helps you to make light of phrases indiscreet, And screens you if detected. You must use your wit, And your good feeling too-to give it just that turn His jealousy demands. If he refuse blank, burn, But do not leave the Note. Of course, you understand, Our ways are above board. We like an open hand, Best where we safely can. He knows the Roman word Is never given in vain. Alexis (aside). Oh, never. Barix. Let him see Rome is his truest friend. Alexis. Of course. Most certainly. Barix. Tickle his fancy too. He likes our horse races, Our football, our gymkhanas. Show him your manliness, Talk of the cup you won—where was it? These things tell Much with the native mind. It will make him tractable. Alexis. I will talk of the Nile Bride. You know, Sir, the great show Announced for Saturday, a thing quite rococo In its barbarity, all actual tears and rage, With the chief actress put to true death on the stage— You should see it, Sir, yourself. Barix. Well, talk of what you will, So he but hear you out and be amenable, And sign. Get the thing signed, and signed with a good grace. Were I a younger man. Alexis, with your face You might work miracles. They say he has a daughter Not altogether plain. Alexis. Belkís. She has made slaughter Of half the Egyptian youth, who are susceptible, And drown themselves by scores in the Pharaonic well Her windows overlook. Krenfil has set a guard To keep them from the place, our Sanitation Board Objecting formally to these malpractices On the score of public health. A furlong round, the trees Were fruited with their corpses. Oh! she is beautiful, They say, as a young heifer—the Copt beauty rule— And sings like Philomel. She knows our literature From Hesiod to Haggardus, talks a Greek as pure As Socrates himself, and last year made in verse A history of the Pharaohs, ancestors of hers. And then her dancing! Barix. Ha! She dances? Alexis. Yes, with grace Transcending, so they tell me, even the Herodias. Barix. A wonderful young lady! But, to be serious, look, The thing needs all our skill. When first we undertook To save these bankrupt lands from possible mischance And claim of the Makawkas Rome's inheritance I gave you my full mind. I let you see within The secret springs of power, the pulse of the machine, And made you share my hopes in this last glorious task Of my life's public toil. I drew aside the mask, And showed you my ambition, all that I designed Of honour for Rome's name, uncabined, unconfined, In African dominion. And for ourselves—ah, well, There, too, we had our hopes, high set, impregnable. I sent you to Byzance. You saw the Emperor. He listened and approved. You crossed the official door Which leads to dignities and places largely paid. You came back my sub-Prefect. Your career was made. Yet you were grateful. Yes, Alexis, you, my son, Were worthy of my pride. I felt my fight half won, An Empire in my hand. All that remains now is To put our final stone upon the edifice. It lies here in this draft. If the Makawkas signs, The government is ours. In practice he resigns; And we, I, you in turn, mere simple citizens, Reign with the Pharaohs, kings by grace of Providence, And our high Emperor's will and the great name of Rome, Accepted as crowned heads by all in Christendom. What say you to it, boy? Alexis. Father, you may count on me In such a noble work. Barix (with emotion). We will set Egypt free, And make her the first realm of all the Roman State, A model to the Nations, rich, regenerate. This hardly is ambition. Duty were a name Truer to call it by. Alexis (aside). The two things are the same In all the lexicons our honest statesmen use. He is a past phrase-master. Yet I share his views. Barix. But why thus count our chickens? We have work to do. You go to the Makawkas, you, Alexis, you, With your fine air of candour. He is a gentleman, And will not dare to show it, even if he doubts your plan. Yet to make doubly sure, address the lady. Alexis. Sir? Barix. Oh, in the way of honour, Caesar's officer Must come with fair proposals, and a son of mine I trust with honest purpose. Alexis. What? As Valentine To the brown beauty? Her? Belkís? Barix. My son, even so, As Valentine to one whose hand, if not of snow, Will bring him a white fortune and a Viceroy's crown. Alexis, you are not a mere light-headed clown, Like most of our young Romans, boys who strut and brawl And ballyrag the natives, holding one and all Slaves to their wit, forsooth, because of a dark skin. You have a higher sense. You hold each citizen Equal before the law and our great Emperor's eye, Be he of shade or shape what Heaven has made him. Why, This lady is a princess. In her veins there runs The blood of all the Pharaohs. She shall breed you sons, Each one of them a prince. And you hold back? Alexis (hesitating). Why, no. I had not thought to marry yet a year or so. The idea perplexes me. (Aside.) And Jael? Good God, and Jael? What will she say to it? Yet I forgot the tale Of her own marrying—that makes the danger less. (Aloud). Sir, I will think it over in all carefulness, And let you know to-night. Barix. Not now? Why, 'tis a chance To jump at in the dark, to seize with your two hands. A kingdom pocketed! a noble service done To Caesar and your country! Think of that, my son. And give me here your word. Alexis. Forgive me. I was slow. Barix. Of course. I knew you would. (He takes Alexis' hand.) Shake hands on it. Now go And do your duty, boy. And Heaven be with you. [Exit Alexis. (Pompously.) Thus Rome marches on her way, humane, victorious! [Barix goes back to his desk. And now to common things—the day's work, the routine Of this great government. Men talk of the divine Pleasures of youth. Give me the joys of middle age. The age of fifty-two. There stands life's happiest page, With honest work each day enough to stir the blood. 'Tis worth all wine and women, if men understood. Here, Boïlas (calling). (Enter Boïlas, a serious young man with an eyeglass and a sarcastic manner.) Barix. Your report? What of the Provinces? We will take the farthest first. Boïlas. My Lord. The Soudanese. Barix. The messenger, then, has come? Boïlas. He came last night much spent, Having killed four dromedaries. The last fell at his tent, A mile outside the town, and he was carried in Half-dead with the despatches. There, it seems, has been Another small affair which has entailed some loss, A skirmish at the outposts—half a troop of horse Trapped in an ambuscade. Our fellows showed good fight, But were overpowered by numbers. With the morning light We got in all the bodies, and identified Young Phædo, of the guard, and a score more beside. Barix. What? Romans? Boïlas. No, Blacks only. Just a small affair With the native force. Barix. That's well. I should not just now care To report much Roman bloodshed to Heraclius. They are touchy at Byzance with the long incubus Of the Moslem raid in Syria. Nothing surer quells The warlike itch than life lost. But mere blacks! What else? Boïlas. The Nile, my Lord, they write still from all sides to me Gives grave cause for alarm. It is already three Full weeks behind its time, and even this messenger From the extremest south had no good news to bear. Barix. It needs our careful thought. Boïlas. My Lord, indeed it needs. Each post brings blacker tidings of the fear that breeds Like a worm in idle brains. The Copts, in their dull rage, Already meet and talk. They claim their privilege Of choosing a Nile bride to pacify the drought. All Egypt is in turmoil and perplexed with doubt, Each maiden being in fear lest the lot fall on her. Already three are named, and every officer Is deluged with petitions on this side and that That Rome should intervene. Barix (pompously). Because the Nile is late And they are children all and need a mother. Rome Has a large bosom truly where all woes come home, Like pigeons to their cote when the kite sweeps the sky. We are their Providence, to bid them live or die. Yes, Boïlas, we are great. But, practically, what Is our best course to take? What say those on the spot? Have we no precedents? Boïlas. The last case of the kind Was in the year fifteen. I have looked it up and find A mass of correspondence, queries, notes, replies, With the sub-governors. This human sacrifice Is a time-honoured right of the Copt heresy. The girls are chosen by lot, each province sending three, And sometimes four or five. They must be beautiful, Well-bred, young, and in health. Strict virtue is a rule All hold as absolute. Barix (with unction). Most right. Boïlas. The ultimate choice Is left to the Makawkas, as presiding voice, Who gives away the bride in solemn ritual, With dirge accompaniment and the Dead March in “Saul,” By the Nile bank at On. A barge new-gilt and decked From stem to stern with flags, is moored, a derelict In the mid-river. To it with banners, fifes, and drums They bring the lady down, and the Chief Sorcerer comes To crown her with fresh flowers. She is already dressed As a bride in white and gold, the sacrificial vest Of the old pagan days, with veils that hide her face. The Patriarch himself sings the high nuptial mass. The keel bolt is withdrawn. The barge is left to sink In mid-stream while crowds kneel in prayer on either brink. The last case caused some talk, and not a little mirth To our officials here beyond its actual worth. It was sent home to Byzance, where certain busy fools, Tourists in search of facts, had preached it to the schools And moved the Patriarch to threaten interdict On the score of superstition. They were nicely tricked When it came before the Court. The living bride they saw Was proved by the defence to be a bride of straw, The dummy sacrifice which every year we make, Even when the Nile is good, for the mere custom's sake. The laugh was turned on them, and those here had their way. The pageant was approved. Barix. And did we not say nay, Boïlas, on moral grounds? The girl was sacrificed Really in flesh and blood? Boïlas. The Makawkas was apprised Of the finding of the Court, but with a private Note Suggesting some reform—a more secluded spot Was ordered for the function, should the case arise Again, than just at On under the whole world's eyes. Barix. Yet it was not condemned? Boïlas. Why, no. In principle The thing was right enough. The ceremony fell Under the religious head and so beyond our sphere, As it has since remained. We could not interfere. Barix. Humph! Boïlas. That is sad. Think you, we could not try This year some further rule, if not full remedy? Is it so popular? Boïlas. Ah, there, my Lord, no doubt— The masses like the show and will not do without. Barix. Yet we might introduce (Well, what do you say to this?) An anaesthetic drug. It much diminishes The corporal pain of death if duly ministered— And saves appearances. It sounds, perhaps, absurd, Yet it is more humane, and we as Romans, should Stand always to the front in sparing human blood And human suffering. Boïlas. I will speak of it, my lord, To-night with the Chief Eunuch. One more serious word, The war news from Arabia and the Caliphate. Barix. I thought the whole thing done. Boïlas. Indeed, I fear, not yet. Our news is less assuring. The fanatic host Still pushes on in Syria and has reached the coast. Tadmor is lost to us. The trans-Euphratean towns Are opening all their gates. A hundred thousand crowns Were paid last month at Hama for a two years' truce. Nor is this all of it. The worst and latest news Tell Antioch beleaguered by these Saracens, And Kurdan, who was sent in haste to its defence, At his last hero shifts, with treachery within And the Emirs without. Barix. I really half begin To think the matter serious. They have let things run, Boïlas, too far ahead. 'Tis time the war was done. It does not pay with Easterns thus to give them rope; They only flout at you; your patience feeds their hope, And they grow fierce as wolves at first sight of your back. O, Lord, the fools men are! Let them come here, the pack, And they shall learn of us what Rome's true schooling is, When she finds time to strike and chide their childishness. Boïlas, it makes me angry. Boïlas. Would to heaven, 'twere so. (Aside.) Yet I would not see them here. [A noise of people outside. Barix goes to the window. Barix. What have we down below? A crowd of women folk. Are these the suppliants You spoke of in your note? Let them come in. (Enter Benjamin with Jael and other women. They kiss the hem of Barix's coat.) Boïlas (to Jael). Off hands, Madam. It is the Prefect. Barix. Let the women be, Good Boïlas. (To Jael.) Now, then, speak. Your nationality? Boïlas. The most of them are Copts. Barix. (to Jael). And yours, young lady? Jael. Sir, My Lord! (Aside.) It is his father. Why is he not here? Benjamin. We are Samaritans. We come to claim that thing Said to be Rome's high gift to all beneath her wing, Protection for the weak, justice, to man, to woman. Barix. Rome is all justice. Benjamin (aside). Bah! (Aloud.) And to be counted Roman. Barix. Speak on. Benjamin. These ladies here, my Lord, are innocents. They have done wrong to none in actions or intents, And are the Emperor's subjects. Wherefore must they die? Barix. What is their grievance, then? We are all clemency. Boïlas (expostulating). My Lord! Barix (correcting himself). Within our scope, and sit with open ears. Benjamin. It is the Nile, dread Sir, and the high officers. They have doomed a maid to die this year in sacrifice, And these are of their choice, maidens discreet and wise, Unblemished in their lives and, as you see them, fair. [Jael throwing herself on her knees with the rest before Barix. Jael. Great Lord, we kneel to you. Barix (retreating). Boïlas, are these aware They should not thus approach me? Ladies, I supplicate. Boïlas (to Benjamin). Remember what I warned you. It is an affair of State. Bid them control themselves. The Prefect is not moved Thus idly by your tears. Jael (aside). Has he then never loved That his eyes cannot weep? He has a face like his, Half tender and half hard in its imperiousness. It is ill to love a Roman. Benjamin. One of these three must die, My Lord, if you withhold your promised clemency. I am an old man. See. This child is my sole staff Of comfort in the world, the thing which makes me laugh Each morning in my tears. O great Lords, look at her In her fresh womanhood, so innocent, so dear. Look at her cheeks, her eyes. Barix (aside, and coming forward to the front with emotion). I once saw a gazelle On the Sakhara plain, a lone secluded dell, With scattered thorn bushes, a green sweet paradise In the chaotic waste, brown pebbles and blue skies, And with her her one fawn. My greyhound gave them chase, And holding a good start made short work of the race, And had the fawn by the throat, a bloody strangled heap, Before I could say “off,” that just before could leap A dozen yards at a bound. The old doe, bleating by, Refused to leave the spot, but lingered piteously, Running this way and that till the hound had her too, And both had got their death who but an hour ago Were the beauty of the place, and filled it with strange life. Then I was grieved for them. The sand about was rife With little marks of feet, and round the bushes still I saw where they had nibbled at their idle will Only that happy morning always two and two. It almost made me weep. (He weeps.) Boïlas, could we not do Some bountiful high act to stop this savagery? Could we not intervene? This Nile bride seems to be A purely pagan custom handed down from days Strange to our Roman morals and humaner ways. I am inclined to spare. Benjamin. These Romans, then, have hearts? He seems about to yield. Boïlas. My Lord, you have more parts Than that of prince to play. The girl's is a hard case. But where is there not hardship in these modern days? And if we stopped to think each time where the wheels go, How should we drive the State machine at all? No, no, We may not make exceptions on mere sentiment. Of course, Sir, you know best. Only I must dissent. Barix. Boïlas, you do me wrong. But might it not perhaps Be a wise policy, a feather in our caps, Here to protect the weak? Boïlas. I fear not with the strong Whose privilege it is to make things right or wrong. Think of the priests and elders. Why, for one of these Women who come to you with their small miseries, There are an hundred men, all taxpayers, who look To the State's Chief for aid. Not one of them would brook Infringement of their right. The superstition is The Nile flood will not rise without the sacrifice. And if you intervene to baulk them in their fears, You have a hornet's nest at once about your ears. There, listen in the yard. [A noise below. Barix. What is it? Boïlas. A procession Headed by drums and fifes. They escort the chief magician And all the highest priests of the Copt heresy, In State towards our doors. Women. O save us. We must flee. Jael. How? Whither? Benjamin. They are come to claim these women here For their Nile butchery. Save them, great Lord. Declare In the high name of law that all men in your hands Are safe while innocent. These are Rome's suppliants. Cast over them Rome's robe. Bid forth the Pretorian Guard. Arrest the ringleaders. Keep them in watch and ward, And hold them from their prey. Barix. 'Twere noble thus to do. How say you, Boïlas? Boïlas (with indignation). Risk the Empire? For a Jew? Look at the enormous crowd. Think of Rome's precedents, A thousand years of fame, built up—on sentiments? No, but on principles. My Lord, this should not be. Let the law take its course. Barix (bewildered). Good ladies, were I free, I gladly would befriend you. But, alas, your case Is not my own to judge, but the Makawkas', I may not intervene. (He points to the window.) Speak to them, Boïlas. Say: (Stammering). “The Imperial word once given, not now, nor yesterday, But generations since, in spite of change holds good. We leave all to His Highness—be that understood— Only commending mercy.” (To the ladies.) No, I hear no more. Ladies, I am your servant. By this postern door, You issue through the garden. Be advised. Go home. You have my tears. Benjamin. And you the curse of the poor, O Rome! Curtain. ACT II Garden House of the Makawkas at On. Alexis and Belkís are found seated under a verandah, with a palm garden in the background. Belkís. Come, come, Alexis, come. Look up. Why should I take Such trouble to be gay and keep us both awake, If you are only dumb? You have sat the morning through And have hardly said a word. What would you have me do? My father has arranged it. I have given consent. We are to marry soon. Alexis. But when? Belkís. Oh, after Lent, Perhaps at Whitsuntide. We will see when the time comes. Alexis. Why not at Easter? Say. Belkís. I cannot do these sums So long before the date. In the meanwhile talk to me. I want to be amused. Life will go drearily If we are to be like this. Let us play at something—chess, Or draughts, or dominoes. Ask me a thing to guess— An intellectual game. Alexis. Belkís! in mercy, no. I will not try again. (Aside.) I cannot run that show, I played with her last night. She made a fool of me, In prose first, then in rhyme. Mere raving lunacy, That will be the end of it. (Aloud, with sentiment, offering to embrace her.) You know what I would have. Belkís. Nonsense, my noble Lord. I am not yet your slave. Besides, my hand is brown. Alexis. (expostulating). Belkís! Belkís. You know it is. Alexis. I swear by all the gods it is divine to kiss. Belkís. You are really too absurd. I am a native girl, With a natural fuzz-head I cannot keep from curl, And you a white sub-Prefect. Faugh! Ridiculous! Come, shall I sing to you? But do not make a fuss If it is not quite Greek music. Say, what shall it be? Alexis. A melancholy lilt without much melody. You know how I adore your Coptic monotones With their little quiver-quavers, and their little ups and downs. See, here is your rebáb. Belkís (taking her rebáb and tuning it, fiercely). You will not like it much, If you understand the words. [She plays a prelude. Alexis. You have a glorious touch. Belkís (aside). How foolish the man is. Hush—hush. [She sings. Song —“If I Forget.” If I forget! Ah, no, not thee my love. There is no room for that while wounds are wet; And dead lips cry aloud to lips that live, Like birds despoiled still piping in the grove Against the cruel snarers of the net. When the sun faints in heaven and the earth tires: Then shall it be. But not to-day, not yet. I swear, by all the gods who were our sires, Not to forgive and never to forget. If I forget! Ah, no. It is not thee. What art thou to me but an idle debt, Paid by the dead past to the days that live, The past of kings whose slaves were like to thee, The past of glories and a sun long set? When the Earth wakes in thunder and mad fires, Then shall it be. But not to-day, not yet. I swear by all the Gods that were my sires, Not to forgive and never to forget. Alexis. Quite beautiful. Belkís (aside). What does he know of it? These Romans are too dull, Too full of their own selves to know the worth of song. The sweetest songs are those where men have suffered wrong. And I am to marry him! For reasons of high state, My poor blind father says—one whom we Copts all hate, One of these Roman Lords with their high insolence, And love and honour him! The pitiful pretence! I have taken his pride down a little, though, already, And taught him what was due at least to one young lady. Yes, he is tame enough. I will give him one more chance. (Aloud.) You have heard me sing, Alexis. Now you must see me dance. Alexis. Indeed, it will be a treat. Belkís. You must stand up with me And take your part in it. And do it cheerfully, Not like a galley slave. There, stand in front and make Signs with your arms like this. Look pleased, for mercy's sake, Whatever you may feel. And follow with your eyes As I dance round you—thus. Alexis. These are the mysteries They used to call of Isis. Belkís. Yes, a country dance. He is too plain a fool to know the difference. There, that is pretty well. [They dance. Alexis. Stop, mercy—stop. I am dead. Belkís. No, no, a little more. [They stop. Alexis, when we are wed, You shall dance like this all night. There, kiss my hand, just once, To show you are in love. And do not be a dunce. I will teach you more next time. Alexis (aside). If this is Coptic love I had rather be with Jael, who put me to less proof. Poor Jael! Poor, quiet Jael! Your love was a sweet dream, Kinder than this. (Enter the Makawkas—he is blind—with his suit.) Belkís. My father. Alexis. Now for our further scheme. Makawkas. Leave all the windows open. What a sweet scent comes in! Not one of them must be shut. I know what the fields mean When I smell the beans in flower. It is not all pure loss This blindness of my eyes when I am gladdened thus. Is that you here, my child? Belkís. Yes, father, at your side, Ready to read to you, to talk. Makawkas. What, you a bride? You are too busy now; too happy, is it not? How glorious it must be to love in such a spot. This once was Pharaoh's garden. Potiphar lived here, The Captain of the Guard and Pharaoh's officer, And Joseph in these walks, as you, my child, now do, Wandered the morning long and heard the wild doves coo. I like to live with them in thought and circumstance Near their own pyramids—one scene in the romance Of their six thousand years. And you? What else can you Find time, in spite of love, for your poor sire to do? Belkís. I will sing to you and dance. You know you love the beat My steps make, and the wind my skirts whirl and my feet. Makawkas. This is no time to dance. Our age is too sedate. Will you advise me, child, on high affairs of state? Belkís. Yes, father. (Aside.) He is here, Alexis, listening. Makawkas. Is he not one with us? Belkís. The tamest asp may sting. Makawkas. Alas! she loves him not. (Aloud.) My Lord Alexis. Alexis. Sir? Makawkas. How goes it in your world? The High Commissioner, Your father, is he well? How of the provinces? Is there good news from Homs? Are Caesar's enemies Vanquished and pacified? Has the Nile risen not yet? We in this garden here, remote from the world, sit And hear the water-wheels turn round with their long drone, And half forget the rest, our lost dominion, Our day of glory gone. Some say there is distress. Alexis. Not yet, but grave concern. The long formalities Of the Dual Government, to sign and countersign Each order with two hands, your Highness' and mine— Mine in my father's place—delay the public work, And aggravate the ill. But neither of us shirk A fraction of our duty, and we trust to bring All to a pleasant end. Your Highness is the spring Of the great State machine. We Romans are the wheels, And where there friction is we need to grease our heels And show ourselves alert. My duty, sir, these days Has been a happy service. Makawkas. She deserves your praise, Though I, her father, say it, being indeed a child Worthy a wise man's love. I am half-reconciled To what you asked of me. (Aside.) If I but knew his heart! Alexis. You mean the draft decree. It will relieve in part The burden on our backs of the Nile Government And be for all our goods. Your Highness' consent Will make the matter easy—a mere form, and yet I would not urge it now save for the overset Of things in Syria and the Nile's wayward way, Which stands in front of us and will not brook delay. Makawkas. Is it so urgent then? Alexis. Quite urgent. The Nile Bride Is just a case in point—one we dare not decide Of our own competence, yet pregnant with more ill If left ungrappled with, while with a single will The whole knot were untied. Your Highness is aware How the case stands for us, how dangerous, how unfair. We held responsible, without authority, You legally the lord, yet neither hand set free To execute a judgment should it chance to clash With the mad popular voice, to oppose which were as rash Perhaps as to consent. The net result of all A scandalous abuse grown quite phenomenal— (Aside.) That's a well-sounding phrase my father would approve. (Aloud.) Whereas, the decree signed, all fits like a new glove. What say you to it, Princess? Belkís. These are politics You must decide yourselves by privilege of sex. I offer no opinion. But this Nile Bride? Say, What is her history? Who is she? Yesterday I heard one had been named and was already here At On for our approval—gloriously fair And full of high resolve. (After a pause with a change of voice.) It must be a sweet thing To die thus for one's country and escape life's sting For ever by one act of perfect constancy. I envy her her lot. Alexis (expostulating). Belkís! Makawkas (expostulating). My child! Belkís (with enthusiasm). Set free For ever from life's load, the thought of age to come, The laughter one endures, the heart's ache answering dumb In bitter self-reproof. If one, indeed, must die, A fair, a precious one, who stands in the world's eye As its most worthy thing; whom no unhappiness Has yet touched—that men know; who is not loved the less, Perhaps, that she loves none; whose loss would threaten pain, More than the bodily pang, to some at least of men: If one, indeed, must die—how well to be that one, Chosen before the rest, all girlhood's champion, With no sad marriage rite, save this with Father Nile, To mar the maiden joy of an unmastered smile! Oh, the divorce of death! And better now than after, While she can hide her tears, a girl, with a girl's laughter (Enter Servant.) Servant. A deputation, sir, from his most Holiness, My Lord the Patriarch. (Enter Patriarch, Magicians, and Attendants; with them Jael veiled.) Belkís. The Bride of the Nile—no less. Alexis (aside). Her face is veiled, and yet— Makawkas. Let them approach me close. Welcome, your Reverences. I am as the world knows An old man and a blind. Whom have you with you here? I seem to hear a step. Patriarch. A lady's, most dread Sir; She comes a suppliant, to join her prayers with ours For the high right to die. Belkís. She stands here crowned with flowers, Father, the Nile Bride's self, a true bride, beautiful As any in the world. Makawkas. Walk, sirs, within. [The Makawkas, the Patriarch, and their suites retire to the back of the stage and seat themselves for a formal audience and converse. Belkís takes Jael's hand and leads her forward to the front of the stage, where they sit apart from the rest.) Belkís. This stool Will do for you and me. Sit down. We will talk alone For a few minutes here and let the rest go on. I want to know it all, and from yourself. This dress [She handles Jael's robes. Is a most lovely thing, and suits your loveliness Exactly. Does it not? Jael. It is the old costume Of the priestesses of Isis, with the lotus bloom Embroidered on the hem, symbol of Eternity. Belkís. And do you love to wear it, though in the thought to die? Jael. I am not afraid of death. Life is too sad a thing To make its loss a grief. Death is the ransoming Of many captive tears. Belkís. You are unhappy then? Perhaps you have learned the truth, the worthlessness of men. Is it not so? Jael. Perhaps. Belkis. Your lover? What was he, Soldier or citizen, of low or high degree, Wise, foolish, froward, fond? I find them all alike Slaves of their own weak wills, too indolent to strike, Too insolent to spare. Or have you met with one, The man one dreams about, born for dominion Over his fellow men, yet to oneself a friend Tender and wise and true, who seeks no selfish end, And is content to serve, and in his service wait The moment of your love, not too importunate Nor yet too proud to feel? Jael. Ah, Princess, you are wise. I never dared to ask impossibilities. I think men do not love. At most in their high will They suffer we should love them and be constant still Even when they grow cold. And then, perhaps, one day When other pleasures fail and grief has come their way, And life of its delights begins to give them less, They think of us and grieve in a new tenderness. This was the way I saw it, all I hoped to see. A pebble, I thought, cast down, by law of gravity Makes the whole Earth leap up to it ne'er so little. And so, if I threw too my whole heart, some small tittle Of love should answer me. I tried it. Belkís. And what came? Jael. A readiness to die. Alexis (she stops). Belkís. Was that name Your lover's? Jael Did I tell it? Yes. Alexis knew Only too well I loved him. Belkís. Did he not love you? Jael. I said men do not love. Perhaps a little while It soothed his idleness to know there was a smile Always in wait for him, should his eyes turn my road. It gave him a light conscience and a sense of good, And never any pain—no, never any pain. Belkís. 'Tis plain, my dear, you spoiled him! 'Tis a bad way with men. But tell me all—the end. What happened? Did he go? Was he untrue to you? Jael. Alas! I hardly know, I think it was ambition and his father's whim To push his fortunes higher. I always urged on him His duty as a son and to his own career. For men need upward flights. It makes them happier. Only, I never guessed. It was a cruel letter In which he told me all, the alliance which should better His fortunes in the world, if I but stood aside. Belkís. And she? Who was she then, this unauspicious bride? Did he not tell her name? Jael. I did not care to ask. And then kind Providence set me this other task, To die a worthy death—for others. It is well. Belkís. My dear, you shall not die. You shall yet wear the veil Of a real happy bride, or I am no Princess here. You shall wed the man you love, be he thrice officer, Thrice Roman, thrice sub-Prefect. Come to them with me And tell them all your tale in its simplicity. My father will be touched. And he, Alexis, look, He too is here with them. I was that bride he took For purposes of State and had proposed to wed. But not in love. Oh no. Of that be comforted. There was no love-making—on his side or on mine. Only a protocol, a treaty we must sign. They are talking of it now. [They rise. The Makawkas and the rest come forward. Makawkas. You say then she consents. I would not grant it else—and that to all intents Her dying injures none? her father, the good Jew, Yields to necessity and takes a generous view Of his own personal loss? Of this you say you are sure. Nor has she special friend whose grief time would not cure, Also that one must die? Patriarch. My Lord, it is just so. The land needs its release from this impending woe. The Nile is a brave river, bountiful to all, Yet cruel in his wrath. His rage we must forestall By this one sacrifice of this one precious thing, And save thereby the rest, a world from suffering. Makawkas. 'Tis an old prejudice. Who knows if it be true? Patriarch. There are strange rules with heaven, to do and not to do. Alexis. 'Tis thus they argue it. We did well to stand by And leave it to themselves. Belkís (appealing to Makawkas). This lady shall not die, Father, while I live here. She is my suppliant. I give her my asylum—'tis no idle vaunt. [She throws her robe round Jael. She lies beneath my robe. I take on me her doom, My Lord the Patriarch. And you, Alexis, come. Look on the face of her I leave here in my stead To be the wife to you I shall not be. You dread To find a stranger's face. It is an idle fear. Hers is more fair than mine and more familiar. She stands before you. Look. I draw aside the veil, (Aside). And clothe myself with death. [She draws aside Jael's veil and veils her own face with it. Alexis. By all that is holy! Jael! Jael. Alexis! (A noise is heard without. Enter a Messenger.) Makawkas. What is this? Messenger. My Lord, three Saracens Stand at the gate without, demanding audience. They are importunate. They come as nuncios, They say from their high Caliph—they, the Emperor's foes, To Egypt their best friend. They stand armed to the teeth, And proud of countenance, as men who fear not death, And will not be denied. Alexis. This cannot be. Messenger. My Lord, They are already here, having driven in the guard. Belkís. Bid them a welcome, father, as ambassadors, Who knows, perhaps from Heaven, at least no foes of ours. Messenger. Foeman or friend, they come. (Enter Hátib and other Arabs.) Alexis By God! the savages! Hátib. The peace of God be with you. Makawkas. Strangers. With you be peace. Belkís. Father, these men are kings, lords born for the world's rule, Entreat them courteously. Hátib (aside). Her face is beautiful As Eve's in paradise. Makawkas. Be seated, sirs. Hátib. Our mission Admits no courtesies till it has found fruition. We come in the name of God. Makawkas. In God's name, sirs, speak on. We listen in respect, returning benison. Hátib. Thus speaks my Lord the Caliph, servant of the Lord, “To all and sundry princes, wielders of the sword, Set in authority, and first of all to him The Makawkas of the Copts, Lord of the later time, Peace be and salutation. Ay and to all men peace Who follow the right guidance. This. And after this, Accept ye Islam. God will give it you twofold, And save you from the fire. Be not like him of old, The Pharaoh whom God slew, lest turning He should smite Your kingdom down with you, in mercy infinite. O People of the Book, who worship the one God, Why will ye serve another? Do ye love the rod? We offer you your freedom, as ourselves are free, Save only from God's service. In simplicity Pronounce the words of Islam. Testify aloud ‘There is no God but God.’” Belkís. It is a message proud To all who bear Rome's yoke, a message to the poor. Alexis (to the Makawkas). My Lord! This is rank treason. Show these men the door. Makawkas. Have patience, good Alexis. (To the Arabs.) Sirs, we wish you well— Only for Caesar's right and the imprescriptible Allegiance that we owe. Alexis. It must not, shall not be. Belkís. Alexis, you forget. Here the authority Lies only with my father. If he choose to give Good welcome to this Prince, 'tis not for you to grieve. Alexis. A Prince! A Mountebank! Hátib. Be silent, infidel, Lest I should send thee straight by the red road to Hell. (To Belkís.) Lady, may God befriend thee on the day of wrath. Alexis. Princess, I take my leave. This champion of the faith Is better here than I. And you, my Lord, take note, I raise a formal bar and protest on the spot Against these men's reception as most treasonous To Rome's imperial name and personally to us. I hold you to your act in its full consequence— (Aside.) Whatever that may mean—and warn you and this Prince That Rome will stand no trifling. Belkís. Be it so. Makawkas. My Lord! Belkís. No matter, father dear. We have this stranger's word. And God shall be our shield though all Hell should assail. Here stands our champion—here. Hátib (with tenderness). Lady. Alexis (turning to go). Come with me, Jael. Curtain. ACT III On the banks of the Nile, a landscape open towards the river, a barge with flags flying in the distance. (Enter Barix and Boïlas conversing.) Barix. I always said it, Boïlas, it must come at last, The day of annexation. Things have moved on fast, Faster than we quite thought a week or two ago. The mills of Rome grind slowly—quite absurdly slow. It comes to the same thing. Boïlas. This, Sir, is the full text Of the proclamation issued. Egypt is annexed To the First Cataract. The Makawkas we depose. Barix. By his own fault and doing, Boïlas. Heaven knows We did our best to spare him. He would take no warning, But chose to go his way. We have wished him now good morning, And shown him to the door. Besides, these crimes of his! Who would have thought it, Boïlas, blind man that he is, And quite respectable in all his outward ways, He should be so black a villain as your report now says? You tell me the very day he took our subsidy He had his cousins strangled, all, to the third degree, And twelve slaves crucified one Sunday afternoon For bringing him cold coffee in his state saloon. And then, the wine he takes! O, Boïlas, it is strange How Eastern Princes drink! Boïlas. Yes, when Rome needs a change. Barix. 'Tis quite a Providence. Boïlas. Indeed a Providence Provided by the State for its own public ends. Barix. You do not, then, believe it? Boïlas. Oh, my Lord, my rule Is always to believe. I was bred in the old school Which holds official truth sacred as Holy Writ, No matter what the fact. I make no face at it, But swallow it down whole. Rogue, thief, or honest man, Drunkard, blue-ribbonite—I back the published plan And add my word of faith to the State legend still. It is only in raw boyhood that one bites one's pill. The Makawkas is deposed. Barix. And what was his demeanour When you conveyed the news? Boïlas. His face grew a shade greener, As a doomed patient's might who feels the surgeon's knife And knows his hour has come and bids good-bye to life. But he did not say a word. Barix. And she, the tragedy Queen, Belkís, who egged him on? Did she, too, sit serene? Boïlas. Serene as a scirocco in the month of March, Calm as a Khamsin piling heaven to one black arch. She stood and stared at me an instant, and then said, “May the Lord God confound thee in the day of dread.” She has caught the Moslem jargon, and can curse or bless With the best Arab of them—a mad lioness. Some say she is affianced to young bare-legs, him Who was the Caliph's envoy, Satan's sturdiest limb, If ever one there was. No matter. Luckily She is better now disposed of, with more modesty, As volunteer Nile Bride. We took her at her word— The best way with such ladies—and so cleared the board. There was a Hebrew damsel, as it seems, by lot Chosen to play chief part in their religious plot, And brought before the Makawkas. The Princess was there, And moved with a fine feeling must needs interfere To save the other's life, giving her own instead As victim in her place. And so the matter sped, Not quite, perhaps, in earnest, when we took the reins. The priests, however, now insist on the full pains And penalties of her act, and all the more that she Has openly espoused the Moslem heresy. It will end for her to-day, here at the river side. Look, here comes the procession! [A noise of shouting without. Voices. Three cheers for the Nile Bride. Barix. I cannot countenance a thing so barbarous. Boïlas, my cloak! Come with me. O Romana jus! The common law must not be violated now That Egypt has the franchise. Boïlas (sarcastically). And let treason grow Till Egypt is disrupted! No, my Lord, 'tis well Things take the turn they do. Let us stand by and tell Our beads for her soul's sake, if you will, but leave the rest For Father Nile to purge in the public interest. Remember, too, Alexis. Barix. Ha! that's true. The girl Was a bit impudent. He was quite out of curl For a fortnight after it, nor yet is quite consoled. Boïlas, maybe you are right. Boïlas. My Lord, she is a scold, And a dangerous character. Let the priests deal with it. Barix. Well, well. But here they come. Boïlas, maybe, you are right. [Exeunt. (Enter procession of Patriarchs, Priests, Magicians, etc., with them Jael and Belkís.) Jael (to Belkís). You will not then relent? Belkís. Alas! dear Jael, no. Even if I could, I would not. What I undergo Is little in the sum of the world's bitterness, Little in the count of wrong. And I will make it less By thinking of your gain. You must be happy, Jael, Happy a thousand years, if but to tell the tale Of one who died too young. Jael. Too young! Ah, you regret Your beautiful life now, in spite of all the fret, Of all the sorrow. Look how glorious the sun is, How wonderful the world. I see tears in your eyes, I see that you would live. Belkís (aside). This weakness must not be. (Aloud.) No, Jael, no. These things are not so dear to me Except for one mad thought. Jael. And what is that? Speak! Speak! Belkís. He told me that he loved me, and my heart is weak To see him once again. (She weeps.) He promised to be here. Jael. Hátib? Belkís. Yes, Hátib, he, the Caliph's messenger. He made his oath to me upon his father's sword, And in the name of God. Will he not keep his word? Patriarch. Ladies, it is time to part. Rome waits on you. Despatch. (Enter Alexis with soldiers—on the other side Hátib and Arabs with Benjamin. These stand apart.) Jael (clinging to Belkís). My lot is one with hers. Alexis. (to soldiers). Here, bring along the batch And drive the business through. Is this the sacred barge? Where is the Patriarch? (To the Patriarch.) I hand over my charge To you, most reverend sir. All that Rome asks is this, The lady's signature to prove her willingness. Patriarch (showing paper). The signature is here attested in due form. Alexis. Then march. Jael. Alexis, stop. Your heel is on the worm, Beware lest it should turn. Alexis. The best way is to crush, Dear Jael, worms that hate us. Jael. Or that love us. Alexis. Tush! This is no case of love. And, if it were, my duty Would make me deaf to all, and blind to her and beauty. You had better now go home. These priests will deal with her For her soul's greater good. I, as Rome's officer, Remain to see it out. But you, my love, go home. Benjamin (aside). A curse be on his tongue. Hátib. A double curse on Rome. Jael. (to Alexis). I have no home but hers. If Belkís weds the Nile I go with her as bridesmaid. So we may beguile The pain of death together. Oh, the shame of life! I would rather die with her than live to be your wife, Unmerciful Alexis. [Alexis motions the guard to advance. They come forward to seize Belkís. Hátib and Benjamin interpose. Alexis. Soldiers, stand by me, Pretorians, to your arms. What is this foolery? Benjamin. Most noble Roman lord, your day of arrogance Ends with this insolent hour. Fate needs to make amends And needs that you should perish. Alexis. Seize the crazy rogue, And send him to the guard-house. Hátib. Unbelieving dog, See, with this sword I smite thee. [The Arabs rush in—fighting on the stage. Alexis. Treason! Help! [Alexis is wounded. By Heaven, These blacks have done for me. [Dies. Benjamin. Ay, die—and unforgiven. Your place is best in Hell. Brothers in arms, fight on. To-day shall seal the doom of Rome's dominion. [Exeunt fighting, all but Belkís and Jael. (Re-enter Benjamin.) Benjamin. Now, by the God of Moses, we are avenged to-day. Our debt is paid in full, the wrongs that made us grey, The stripes with which we ached, our hopes so long deferred Of an ideal reckoning, insolent word with word, Insolent act with act. To see these Roman clowns With their long arrogance, who ruled it in our towns, Masters and Lords of all, and prated of their law As the one saving fact the Eastern world yet saw, And of themselves in it as missioners divine Incalculable in blessings, scattering oil and wine And lavish wealth on us, with their great Roman peace— The impudent imposture—on their bended knees To a mere shouting horde of shoeless Ishmaelites! O, it is noble! Jael. Father. Benjamin. There are sounds and sights Dear to Jerusalem, the clamour of death's wings After a flying foe, the night which vengeance brings Upon a stricken host. I saw old Barix's face Pale with the agony of a supreme disgrace, Mounting his horse to fly. He trembled, spite the grim Smile on his lips, at me. I wagged my head at him, And wished him a safe journey to Heraclius, Advancement and more pay, as one victorious. He had just signed with his proud hand the final act, Yielding all Egypt up, to the third cataract, To 'Amru's camel-riders. Their beasts idly browsed Already in his garden, and themselves were housed As idly in his palace. I could hear them shout Their orders to his slaves; and they were leading out His own white heifer herd for slaughter at his door. A regular Belshazzar. Scarce a broken score Remained to him in force of his Pretorian guard, Stern in their discipline, erect, unbending, hard, Imaging Rome's lost headship of the world that was. Jael. And these, the Saracens? Is there more certain cause To see them as new friends? Their faces frighten me, Their eyes, their gesturings. Benjamin. They come with liberty And in the name of God, the God that is our own, To purge a weary world of Rome's dominion. It is the God of Israel smiting with their sword. Jael. And of their prophet, what? Benjamin. Commissioned by the Lord, As Amos was commissioned. Think you, my sweet child, That prophets are all princes, with hands undefiled By the world's common work, and sitting clothed like kings, And singing in soft voices news of pleasant things? Not so. The voice of power speaks from the wilderness. It chooses untaught men, lone wanderers of the rocks, Shepherds with slings and stones, young psalmists from their flocks, And naked insane priests, God's instruments of wrath. And so, too, this Mohammed. Math and aftermath He has mowed their cities. Princes, kings, and potentates, The proudest heads of them, like weak inebriates, Have fallen back staggering, and confess because they feel His heavy hand upon them and his pricks of steel, Their eyes bent to the earth. Priests, who the heresy Banned yet a moment since, constrained as from on high, Bear witness to his truth, and with unsandalled feet And rope-bound heads attest the promised Paraclete, Mohammed the foretold, last of God's messengers. There is no God but God. (Enter 'Amru, Hátib, and the Lords of the Arabs.) Jael. My doubt disappears. It is His Angel host, so beautiful, so proud, So noble in its bearing. Belkís. They have swept the crowd Of base white faces back. The Nile no more shall see Those visages of death disgraced with leprosy Upon its alien shores. Rejoice, O glorious land, Thy day-dream is fulfilled. Join hand with happy hand, Ye daughters of despair. Dance, clap your hands and sing For your salvation all, ye sons of sorrowing. Give me the cymbals, Jael. I feel that I must dance In honour of this day which works deliverance. Jael. Nay, but the dead. Belkís. What dead? Jael (pointing to Alexis' body). He once was dear to me. Belkís. No matter, Jael. Our lives we gave. This sets us free. We will forget the past. Jael. You swore not to forget. Belkís. The old life is no more. The new has paid the debt. [She sings. Song—“If I Forget.” If I forget! O, gladly, from my soul! I swore once in my rage that I would hate. But life is sweet, and I have learned to live. Behold, I cast away these weeds of dole. I triumph o'er my tears and scorn regret. Farewell, sad vengeance! See, my soul aspires To life and love. I will not die—not yet. I swear by all the Gods that were my sires To laugh to-day—for ever to forget! 'Amru. The promised houris these. Hátib. They are both beautiful, Fair as the sun, the moon—each one a star, a jewel Hung in the firmament. It were a glorious fate To be beloved of them. 'Amru. For me it comes too late, I am already wed—to duty and my sword. You, Hátib, are more free. Hátib (aside). My heart leaps at his word. (Enter Patriarch and Priests.) 'Amru. But who are these vain men? Speak, reverend seniors, What is your will with us? Patriarch. To pay you our devoirs As princes of our land, since God hath given it you And to our Lord the Caliph. This first, as is due, —And next to make petition. 'Amru. Speak, in the Lord's name. Patriarch. We crave you an indulgence, and to ease the shame That rests upon our land through the Nile's waywardness. The river is in drought and needs a sacrifice. This lady is his bride. We ask authority To celebrate our rite. The need is she should die, According to our law and custom luminous, To give the land its rest. Voices without. We ask it, all of us. 'Amru. What is this folly, Hátib? Hátib. 'Tis an evil creed Of the days of ignorance. They deem the Nile has need Of a pure virgin life to pacify the drought And bring it to full flood. And so the people shout. This noble lady here is daughter of their prince, A maiden without stain, supreme in innocence Of all in Roman lands, and they demand her death As bride of their proud river. 'Amru. 'Tis a pestilent faith And lawless superstition we do well to end. Bring me a pen and paper. Hátib. Here. 'Amru. Most reverend And worthy gentlemen. You ask an impious thing, This innocent lady's death. The Lord alone is King Of the wide Earth and Sea and all that therein is, The lakes and streams and rivers in their fall and rise, The plenty and the dearth. It is a crime ye seek. Be, rather, merciful, seeing yourselves how weak, And leave to God the judgment. Ladies, have no fear. We take you in protection. And you, reverend sir, Go with this written word and message clear of guile, And you shall see a wonder. He writes.) “To the River Nile, “Peace be and salutation. We, in the Caliph's name, “Demand your service thus: O river of old fame! “If that indeed thou be the servant of the Lord, “The Lord God, the Almighty, hearkening to His word, “Hear and obey this message; Set thy waters free “According to their wont in full fertility “Upon this land of Egypt. She is a land of peace “With claim to all protections and immunities. “So may God succour thee. But if, as these men say, “Thou heedest not our counsel, going thy own vain way, “Then, go to thy more hurt. The Lord God shall provide “Or with thee, or without thee.” Fling this message wide Into the stagnant flood, and bring me word again. [He gives the paper to the Patriarch, who exit with suite. Benjamin. Most wise of magistrates! Most glorious of men! We do thee reverence, all. Belkís (coming forward). A princess kneels to thee. [Belkís and Jael make show of kneeling. 'Amru (raising Belkís). Not so. Thy hand I kiss, most fair one. Were I free, I would in my own person do thee right for this That I have marred awhile thy bridal happiness With our good Father Nile. Forgive it me. Here stands A noble officer shall do thee more amends. Hátib, your hand for her. Hátib. Ah, Princess, might I dare Aspire to your high favour in this world of care, How blessed were my lot. Belkís (pointing to Jael). My lot and hers are one. We have made oath together not to live alone. (Aside.) And yet, alas! I love him. Jael. Ah, you love him. Yes. Let not the thought of mine prevent your happiness. Belkís. No, no, I will not wed him. Jael. Yes. You must, and shall. Belkís (smiling). We will be old maids together, grave and musical, But we must not be parted. Hátib (speaking slowly). Ladies, why dispute? Is love so poor a thing, so spiritless to boot, That it should frightened be to pledge a double troth? Belkís. Ah, Hátib. By your law? Hátib. Why not? Belkis (triumphantly). He weds us both, Dear Jael. Jael. Ah, what bliss! Hátib (giving to each a hand). Ladies, I kneel and pray. 'Amru. This is a happy ending to a happy day. (Shouting is heard outside. A crowd rushes in. Enter a Messenger with dripping clothes.) 'Amru. O, wonderful! My letter! Messenger. (showing his wet clothes). See the answer to it. The Nile is in full flood. 'Amru. Thank God. Benjamin (with fervour). Oh! Roma fuit. Curtain. THE LITTLE LEFT HAND A MID-VICTORIAN DRAMA IN THREE ACTS (Written in 1897) DRAMATIS PERSONAE Sir John Leicester, a Revolutionary Soldier of Fortune.

Bradshaw leaders of the Idealist Movement. Paul, an Idealist. Lady Marian (Lady Bellingham). Rosina, her Maid. Phoebe, an Idealist. Town Councillors, Soldiers, Idealists, etc., etc. Place A Country Town in England. Time Mid-Victorian. ACT I Scene I A large Room scantily furnished. Leicester, Davis, Bradshaw. Leicester. Is all in readiness? The plan well understood? The ground marked out and flagged? How many will face blood, Think you, when the pinch comes? I have seen soldiers fly From a sudden shower of stones who had scorned cavalry, Ay, and artillery too, but without special drill Bolted like boys. 'Twas thus we lost Majuba Hill In the Boer War. Mind this, strength lies in discipline, Davis. And a good cause, Bradshaw. And chief. What fear but we shall win With you, Sir, for our leader? Leicester. Truce to compliments. This is a soldier's battle. Drill and common sense, And the mot d'ordre to act distinctly in their heads, There lies our generalship. Davis. Our men will face the reds If you only wave your hand. Bradshaw. Your name's a guarantee With every one of them for certain victory Wherever freedom's fought for. Pueblo, Puttenden, Canea, Cansfield, Crete, the Bridge of Sittingen, These have become their watchwords. They all know your face, Although they never saw you till this year of grace. The women have your portrait framed in every room Clothed in the heroic white renowned through Christendom. They know your motto “Jamais,” and the left-hand glove Pinned to your forage cap, and look for it with love; It is your badge of fortune now become their own. The children strut like you and imitate your frown. Oh! we are well prepared. Leicester. This is all excellent. But how about your strength? Have you the complement Of small arms for your force? Eight hundred men, you say, Of the volunteers are yours. How are they armed? Davis. To-day The force will be complete. We have advice from York Announcing their dispatch by the first train. Leicester. Close work, Even if they come to time. And if they are delayed? Davis. We have the invoice, Sir. Leicester. The invoice, I am afraid, Will be of little use if the Queen's troops are here. Bradshaw. They dare not send the troops! Leicester. Of that I am less clear. These are the days of force, and Governments to live Must use the powers they wield, even if they next forgive. All must have heart to fight if they would hold their own, The Priest to hold his creed, the King to hold his throne. Strength justifies alike coercion and revolt, And Jove would not be Jove but for the thunderbolt. Davis. We are Idealists and take no count of Kings. Leicester. Yet a King's constables are facts and stubborn things. Davis. The constables are ours, all but the Officers. Leicester. The greater reason then to expect the regulars. There should be news in town at the High Council Board. Go, Gentlemen, I pray, and bring me the last word; Tell them my message is to stand fast by the plan Resolved upon last night, doing the best we can, Troops or no troops. We meet to-morrow on Pains Hill The whole strength of the League, calm but inflexible. At the first stroke of noon we march, each separate band Led by a Councillor holding the chief command, The wards have their own drums and flags. A signal gun Will order the advance and notify the town. Our first point is the churches. These in your possession, You have half gained your cause, and half fulfilled your mission. A faith proclaimed in church is a faith justified. (Aside.) Just as a woman wronged becomes in church a bride. (Aloud.) Here is your moral triumph. The material fight Needs your more active thought, for right still lies with might. We need ten thousand men well armed to hold the ground Against all possible force. See that the men be found. And come again with news. Davis. You shall not wait for us. Bradshaw. Your fortune leads our own. Both are victorious. [Exeunt Davis and Bradshaw. Scene II Leicester (alone). Like all the rest of them, they think a fight is won By the noise of shawms and trumpets blown in the new moon. Jericho's their precedent. They mock at the old faiths But still seek miracles at life's hand and death's. Why have they sent for me? Because my luck was good, And they were in straits, poor fools, to save their Brotherhood. My name alone, they say, is to work prodigies, A gambler's argument. But is it so unwise? No, or I were not here. All faith is a wise thing, Compared with the lack of it. And therein lies the sting Of my own unreal life. What a mad lot is mine, Called to this leadership of a cause half divine, And pushed to martyrdom by my plain act and deed, Yet being what I am, a man without a creed, Almost without a hope of the world's better way, And mired with a dark past, my sins of yesterday. Their virtue shames me. Ah! if they could see in truth Their trusted leader's heart, his insolence of youth, His violent manhood—ay, the rebellious instincts still Ruling his better reason, his enfeebled will Battling with memories of an unburied past. If they could learn her name, the dearest loved and last, Who sent him forth to deeds the nations now applaud For her sole vanity, with vain love for reward, They would disown his help, and cast him out from them, A treachery unmasked, a fraud, a stratagem, Spite of their need to-day and his help timely given, These poor Idealists with their unselfish heaven. And yet their leader loves them. All that is best in me Thrills at their touch, my pride which is not vanity, My consciousness of right, my new-born rectitude, My love of virtuous deeds, their own the ideal good. No, no, this is not vanity. Say rather a fire Lit by consuming shame, the unfulfilled desire Of an heroic youth which would obliterate The memory of its fall and so be quits with fate. What else is Man's ambition, even at the best? To do some worthiest deed before he takes his rest? And who knows rightly what? We are too ignorant To do good to the world except by accident. The sole sure good is to ourselves. And who dares die Unjustified by deeds while deeds can justify? To-morrow will prove all. If we outride the storm, We found a new religion for the world's reform And our undying fame. If we are overcome The world will weep for us achieving martyrdom. Oh, Marian, Marian! With that little white left hand What kingdoms have you rent! Scene III Leicester seated. Phoebe (entering). I did not understand You were alone and busy. Oh, excuse me, Sir. I see you are in thought. Leicester. No, dear petitioner, You do not trouble me. It was but idleness Made me look sad. It does me good to see your face. Phoebe. Do you mean it so? Leicester. Yes certainly. Sit down awhile, And tell me all your wish. Phoebe. I wished to see you smile Instead of frowning. Leicester. How? Phoebe. You have so stern a look When speaking to the crowds. Leicester. This is a bad rebuke For a popular leader, one who would persuade mankind. Phoebe. Oh! Now you laugh at me. This was not in my mind. Only I watch you daily when you speak, and then I wonder at your sadness more than the rest of men. And often I have wished— Leicester. For what, you foolish child? Phoebe. That I could make you happy. See, now you have smiled. Leicester. You are very young. Phoebe. Sixteen. Leicester. And an Idealist! Phoebe. Yes. Leicester. And you speak your thought? Phoebe. We all do. It is best. Leicester. Then tell me the whole truth. I would like to learn your art, Being myself of those who search the human heart, And try to make the world, if may be, happier. How would you cure my grief? Phoebe. I would be your follower, To guard you from all peril. In your hours of pain I would talk till you forgot. Grief would be silent then, And I should need no word. You would rest still as now And listen to my voice as to a river's flow, And you would sleep— Leicester. 'Tis well. And what else? Phoebe. I would sit Your daily worshipper, a Mary at your feet, Gathering in the pearls of wisdom you let fall And give them back to you new strung. Leicester. And is that all? It would not be enough. Let me know all your store. Phoebe. Oh, I would love you too, now and for evermore. Leicester. You are pretty, far too pretty. Phoebe. What has prettiness To do with what I ask? Leicester (aside). Perhaps more than you guess. Phoebe. I cannot help it. Leicester. No. To be pretty is no crime. You shall have lovers yet, and in a happier time It is pleasant to be loved. Phoebe. I would rather die for you Than be loved by all the world—even if that were true. (With emotion.) That were the ideal ending of the ideal life: To fall, a flower cut down, and not to feel the knife Because of the great joy transcending pain. How often I have thought of this in dreams, till tears have come to soften Pain to an ecstasy. Struck thus—by the last dart Of the last flying foe aimed at the hero's heart, Leaving the victory his and the world's battle won, And so faint in his fame as clouds faint in the sun! Leicester. And if your hero loved you, and you did not die? Phoebe. I would then live for him. Leicester. In what capacity? Phoebe. As the companion of his thoughts. All men, they say, Need some poor woman's wit to help them on their way. Mine is intelligent. I have observant eyes. He would not find me childish if not always wise, And then— Leicester. And then what? Phoebe. It is pleasant to be loved (You said it, Sir, just now), and he should find it proved. Leicester. You are talking nonsense. Love? What do you know of it? Love is a malady, a grief, a fever fit, A darkening of the soul, which hides the ideal light. Phoebe. How then can it be sweet? Leicester. Sweet things are seldom right. Phoebe. And you condemn it? Love, our missionaries teach, Is a sacrament of fire uniting each to each— We need it for our lives—the initial principle Which gives the mind its power to work for good and ill; For good if we love right, and our soul meets a soul Large in its purposes, and the two make a whole Possessed of double strength and wise in loveliness. Leicester. Under what visible sign? Phoebe. The sacramental kiss. This surely is for good. You do not doubt it? Leicester. No. But if it work for ill? Phoebe. That is the tragic woe Of the world's wickedness, yet unregenerate; The cause of half its pain, the cause of all its hate. They would stamp this out in blood; there is no other hope. Leicester. And it, too, has a sign? Phoebe. That is beyond my scope. I would not know of it. But love is not to blame If men do evil things and call it in love's name. Leicester. Dear child, you are too sweet. (Aside.) Alas! and innocent. Kisses her.) Phoebe. What is it? He has kissed me! It is the sacrament! Scene IV Paul entering surprises Leicester holding Phoebe's hand. Paul (aside). Phoebe with the chief! How's this? She has an ecstatic look, Like the Virgin with the Angel, drawn in a missal book. I do not like his smile. (Aloud.) Sir John, I come with news Most urgent from the Board. Leicester. Your haste needs no excuse. Speak. Paul. It is ascertained the forces of the crown Have been reinforced in strength. Two regiments, sent down In the night from Liverpool, now hold the central square In front of St. Jude's Church and the main thoroughfare From Langley waterworks to the “Cock” at Chesterton. The side streets are patrolled by the new garrison Who question all who pass. There are three field-pieces Posted in Worship Street near the old granaries. The lower town alone is in the City's hands. Moreover, a troop of Horse— Leicester. It must be Westmoreland's. Did I not say it? Quick, give me my sword. Stay here, Paul, till I come again or send a messenger. This news needs all our thought, perhaps a change of plan. (Aside.) My hour has come at last and I must play the man. Phoebe (aside). He is gone, without a look, without a thought of me. And Paul, what does he think? Oh, this is misery. (Weeps.) Scene V Paul and Phoebe alone. Paul. Phoebe, you are in tears. What is the meaning, say! This is no hour to cry, be the cause what it may, To-morrow we may need it. But to-day our grief Needs other arms than these. Shame on your handkerchief, Shame on your foolishness. This hero, what is he That you should weep? A God, of poor humanity! A God? A mountebank! He has a tragic face And a voice that trembles well, and that is all his case. What is he to you, Phoebe, but a name in print? Poser and partisan? I do not trust the mint Where he was coined. He was a soldier, too—the name Stinks in all honest nostrils. 'Tis a double game These soldiers play for honour in their fool's career— This side a patriot, that a licensed buccaneer. Phoebe. Hush, you blaspheme a saint. Paul. Leicester is virtuous As a man looks grave in church. Before the world and us He stands with a face bowed and his eternal frown. But who has seen his heart? Phoebe. His heart, like his renown, Is high above our world. Paul. They tell another tale Who knew him in his youth. Phoebe, you are looking pale. What is your secret, girl? This great man's confidence Is yours. He held your hand and smiled a minute since. What does he say when smiling? Phoebe. You are too cruel, Paul, Unjust, irreverent. Paul. Love then is lord of all, As the unconverted teach. And our chief Puritan Stands feebly bandying words as between maid and man With one a Hedonist. You blush now. Your cheeks speak More strongly than your words, showing you more than weak. Phoebe. It is true I love him. Paul. What! Love! And at such a time, With the world's fate at issue! Phoebe, it is a crime! You have no right to folly! Look me in the face And say this shall not be! A crime—and a disgrace! Phoebe. No, neither. You are mad. My love is not like this, A thing to count for shame or count for foolishness. It is a strength to me, a buttress to our cause, A glory to my heart, a law transcending laws, The love that casts out fear. Paul. But if your leader shrink? Phoebe. The shame is yours to doubt. The shame is yours to think. Leicester has never failed. Paul. He never yet has stood Opposed to what he loves dear as his flesh and blood. He is a soldier still. His fetish is the rag Borne by his regiment. The honour of the flag Excuses all dishonour in a soldier's mind. He will not strike at it, or strike as one being blind. Phoebe. You mean he will betray us? (Aside.) This is jealousy Because he loves me too. Paul. To-morrow we shall see. Scene VI (Re-enter Leicester, Davis, Bradshaw, and Town Councillors.) Leicester. We fight then? That is fixed? I understand you right? Your minds are all made up? Bradshaw. Happen what will, we fight. Davis. We do not shrink from it. A Town Councillor. We only asked your thought To strengthen our decision. 2nd Town Councillor. Your experience bought Upon so many fields, the instinct of your eye Used to command the fight and snatch the victory. Leicester. I thank you, Gentlemen. Keen measures are my trade. I am a soldier bred and dare not be afraid, Even where the odds are great. If all are of your heart We need not doubt to play a creditable part And pull the matter through. In the game of battle chance Has always a last word which means deliverance For him who fights the hardest. We shall win the day In spite of the Queen's troops, do they the worst they may. My mind is clear to risk it. Phoebe (to Paul). You have heard him, Paul? Paul. I hear him and I watch. Town Councillors. We are determined all. Leicester. Then each man to his post. (Aside.) It is a desperate plan. But what have I to lose? Ah! Marian, Marian! [They turn to go out. Enter Messenger who stops Leicester. Messenger. A message for the chief. Leicester. A moment, Sirs—what now? Messenger. There is an Officer with a white flag below, The bearer of this letter from their General, sent To you, Sir John, our chief. Leicester (looking at the envelope). From the Queen's Government. It is too late—too late. We cannot look at it. And yet this handwriting! I know it, but forget, I cannot put a name. Here! Stop! I will speak with him, If I do not open it. It all is like a dream This monogram and badge, “Loyaulté me oblige.” How strangely things come back.—Sebastopol, the siege, The fight at Inkerman, when I a subaltern Took glory in it all. What nonsense! My cheeks burn Even at this late day to picture certain scenes, And certain words, and men “So proud to be the Queen's Servants and Officers!” I dreamed of it last night, And thought myself insulted at some trivial slight Hurled at Her Majesty by God knows what mad fool Whom I must teach his lesson in the fencing school, And bring to better manners. (Looking at Paul and Phoebe.) That child's eyes on me Are a reproach, and his, with their sincerity. (Enter Warren.) (Aloud.) Leave us, good Paul and Phoebe. The Town Councillors Should know this new arrival. It may need some course Of action not discussed. Go, both, and call them back Once more for one last word. Phoebe (to Paul). My heart is on the rack To leave him with this man. I fear some treachery. Paul. On which side, Phoebe? His? Phoebe. Distrustful! Paul. We shall see. [Exeunt Paul and Phoebe. Scene VII Leicester and Warren alone. Leicester. Well, Sir! You would speak to me! Warren. My orders were, Sir John, To press you for an answer. Leicester. Frankly, I have none. I have not read the letter, nor intend to read. Things are too far advanced—or not enough—and need Their settlement elsewhere. When we have paid that score There may be room perhaps for parleying—not before. Warren. I understand you, Sir. And yet my duty is To press you to consider the full penalties, Not to yourself, Sir John, I do not speak of that, But to these ignorant fools who run upon their fate Without a full fore-knowledge. They are at best— Leicester. A mob. Warren. No, but an untried mass— Leicester. Of heroes on the job, (We will put it so) poor heroes to their shirt-sleeves stripped Against scientific strength professionally equipped. Warren. You do not doubt the issue? Leicester. Doubt it! Pardon me, I never doubt my star. 'Tis my sole vanity. Warren. I see I shall not move you. Yet before I go Forgive me if I speak my pain it should be so As a man and Officer. (Aside.) I must play my strongest card. (Aloud.) You were, Sir John, I know, like me in the Queen's Guard Some years before I joined, in the old fighting days Of the Crimean War, which our tradition says Was a battle of the Gods. There is in the Brigade A record extant still of your great escapade In which you first won fame. We all are proud of it, Believe me, to this hour as a regimental feat, And even, if I may say it without disloyalty, We are proud of the rest too, the career of victory In many a strange land which you have made your own, Abroad, on the Continent. We admire your wide renown. Only, excuse me, Sir, if I speak plainly, we Like it less well at home—for the Queen's loyalty And the old regiment, you understood me, Sir, And why I brought this letter as interpreter Of a last hope of peace from— Leicester. Whose, Sir, is this hand? (Aside.) His pleading touches me. Warren. The General's in command. Who once was your best friend. Leicester. My friend, Sir? And his name? (Aside.) I seem to clutch at shadows. Warren. General Bellingham. Leicester (aside). Her husband! The old man! Fool, that I did not guess. (Aloud.) He was my Colonel once. Your General now? Warren. No less. Leicester (after a pause). Give me the letter back. (Aside.) It half unmans me. (Opens it—while he is reading re-enter Davis, Bradshaw, Town Councillors, Paul and Phoebe.) (Aloud to Davis.) Read. You all should know the contents. Warren. They deserve your heed. Leicester. What says he, Mr. Davis? Davis. 'Tis from the General To you, Sir, in command of the rebel forces all. I give its sense in brief. It deprecates the strife Impending on both sides, the causeless loss of life, The pain Her Majesty—it says the “personal pain”— Feels at the unhappy issue for misguided men, Whose cause, but for the force, would merit sympathy. It promises redress, a parliamentary Commission on the case, and such remedial acts As prudence shall desire with due regard to facts. Paul (aside). Et cetera, et cetera, the usual jargon used By Governments in straits till they have got you noosed. Davis. An amnesty to all but common law-breakers. Paul (aside). Which means a loophole left to hang malingerers. Davis. In the meanwhile under truce— Paul (aside). To gain time. Davis. —he invites The chief to a conference. Leicester. What say you? Paul (aside). Ha! He bites. We shall see him presently my Lord Chief Advocate Upon the Government side. All comes to those who wait. Phoebe (aside). I only fear betrayal. (Aloud.) Can we trust them, Sir? Bradshaw. If there were treachery meant? Leicester. I have no personal fear. Their General I know. Paul (aside). Ha! Leicester. A comrade of old days. He would not condescend to disingenuous ways. I should not fear to go. The Government? Ah, well, That is another thing as all our histories tell. And yet the terms seem good. Town Councillor. We pray you counsel us. Leicester. I hardly dare advise. It is too onerous. My friend here, Paul, would say— Town Councillor. No matter, Sir. The boy Shall hold his bitter tongue. Speak on without annoy. Leicester. I will tell you then my thought. The terms proposed seem good, The best that could be hoped to save your Brotherhood And, if agreed to, screen the cause from further hurt. Though Governments are false, they dare not eat the dirt Of their own written word made false by treachery. They twist, equivocate, but seldom in terms lie. Holding this letter, signed by their commissioner, The General in command, we may treat them without fear. A common ruse of war? A trap to catch me in? I cannot see it so. I would trust my head within The lion's jaws unmoved. I know he would not bite. All soldiers have one code, one rule of wrong and right, And treachery could not be under a flag of truce. The question therefore is: Shall we or not make use Of the occasion given of peace? Do you so far trust me As to send me with full powers and your authority To do the best I can? Before I go, be sure All shall be ready set for fight in half an hour. Town Councillor. We only fear their wiles—the price set on your head. Phoebe (aside). He shall not go alone. Warren. I stay here in his stead If you have doubt for him. Leicester. We have no doubt at all, Only to be prepared and loyally forestall All possible accident and casual surprise From whatsoever cause. (It is best to be forewise.) This be our plan of action: if at the stroke of noon I still be unreturned, fire a first signal gun; It will warn me to break off a useless argument, And bring me back to you at speed the way I went. Town Councillor. And if you should not come? Leicester. Give me ten minutes law, Then forward in full force and give them tooth and claw. (With his hand to his sword.) I will fight my way to you. Phoebe (aside). He shall not go alone. Paul. He shall be closely watched. Town Councillor. Go, Sir. Warren (aside). The game is won. [Exeunt. Curtain. ACT II Scene I A Sitting-room at an Inn with a recess partly screened. Lady Marian and her Maid. Lady Marian. Have the flowers come, Rosina? Rosina. No, Milady. Lady Marian. Send For others then. I see a girl at the street's end Selling some mignonette. What do you say? (Putting on a bow.) This bow, Is it too bright for the rest? Rosina. Indeed, Milady, no. It lights the dress up well. Milady is too young For only greys and greens. Lady Marian. You have a foolish tongue, Rosina, I am thirty. And to-day, who knows What tragedies may be if it should come to blows? I am getting old and sad. Rosina, look at this. Rosina. A first grey hair means luck. It is for happiness. Lady Marian. And you, Rosina? Rosina. I? Milady knows me well. I have no time to be sad. Lady Marian. You have your Cœur fidèle? Is he still nice to you? Rosina. Oh, all that I desire, Generous, devoted, gay, a temperament of fire, And then a Sergeant, too! The men of his company Are all afraid of him—And he is afraid of me. Lady Marian. You are a fortunate girl. Find me a pair of gloves Less soiled than these. (While Rosina looks in the drawer.) Well, well, yours are the best of loves. Rosina. There are none left. Lady Marian. What, none? Rosina. Here is an odd right hand. Lady Marian. (snatching it). Give it. Rosina. The left is gone. Lady Marian. No matter. Go now, and Bring me that flower girl here. Exit Rosina. Scene II Lady Marian alone. Lady Marian (looking at the glove). How strange! And just to-day Of all the days in the year, the twenty-first of May, Our anniversary. Strange, wonderfully strange! And the years which still go on without perceptible change. [Goes to a looking-glass and sits before it. What is the use of beauty? Am I a happier woman Because of this weariful beauty of face? Or is there a human Being in the world to-day who goes with a lighter heart Because I am what I am, the type of romantic art? Rossetti called me so. I see men in the street Who stop and turn their eyes. I heard one call me sweet Only the other day. Lord Lightfoot writes me verse, Just as he always did, no better and no worse. The press still praises me. The prophets find me wit. Am I the happier? Does it amuse me? No, not a bit. I always was Fair Marian, beautiful Marian, names My father gave me first, who loved to see the flames Burn in my girlish cheeks—“The Pirate Flag” he said. It was his dear delight, and fairly turned my head. But the rest—the rest of them—no. They only weary me. See, I would give it all for an hour of folly—if folly could be. I have been married, how many years? Six? Eight? No, ten. Husbands are blind to all, be they the best of men. What does he know of me? Nothing. What has he seen of it all? The ghosts that come in the dark? The tears that in secret fall? He is an honest soul, a brave man, all you please, Only not with the eye that understands and sees. Wrapped in ambition's fold, his “Duty to his Queen,” He hardly knows how chaste, how faithful I have been. Ah! to be pretty and wise! It sounds well. But, in sum, Years of silent regret for a folly that might have come. Once in my life, once only, and then for how short a day, I saw the man I could love. But fate has swept him away, Fate and my own sad virtue. He stood like this, my hand Pressed to his heart, that throbbed in a way I could understand. He hardly told me he loved me, hardly more than a word, But my fingers fluttered in his like the wings of a prisoned bird, And his eyes looked in my eyes. Such joy was in my heart I could have danced and sung. But I played my woman's part Bravely, and bade him go. I gave him only my glove— Who would have given how much?—a world of passion and love— My glove, the fellow to this. He wears it still, they say, With our last words for motto: “Jamais! À jamais!” Leicester, the rebel Leicester, the arch-reprobate, The outcast from the world, the man whom all men hate, Yet whom all women love. It lies here in its woe, The glove that covered the hand he told me he treasured so. Ah, this little left hand, a beautiful, wonderful thing, With its little useless fingers, its little useless ring! How has it played with my life! A hand is a soul. We give it When we are married lightly, and later try to outlive it. We face the world with a smile. We spread our sails in the sun. We want it for some one else. It is lost and given and gone. The deluge comes apace. The storm howls on the track. Vainly the hand goes forth. Time heeds not, nor gives back, And the soul is drowned in tears. (Weeps.) (Drums outside.) I hate this soldiering life With its dull mummeries and make-believe of strife, Ending perhaps as now in a real butchery. [Goes to the window. How sweet the morning is. It should be hard to die On a bright day like this, even here in this black town. Yet all are wild for blood. Scene III (Re-enter Rosina with Phoebe disguised as a flower girl.) Lady Marian. Where is my lord? Rosina. Gone down, Milady, to the Square. He bade me tell you this, And not to fear the result. Ah, what a sight it is To see them marching past in their new uniforms! Lady Marian. Nonsense, Rosina, nonsense! When this business warms We shall see them with less paint, not quite such demigods. But is your Sergeant with them? Rosina. Yes. Though what's the odds? He will get his clasp and medal—with no risk, they say. Lady Marian. And that would please you? Rosina. Yes. 'Tis as good as another way. Lady Marian. Well, let us hope the best. (To Phoebe.) Ah, you have brought the flowers! Are you not frightened, child? Phoebe. At what? Lady Marian. These troops of ours, The chance of blood being shed. The streets are full of men. It is not safe for you. Phoebe. I have a life to gain (pointing to the flowers), As well as one to lose. (Aside.) This is their General's house And this his wife, whom Paul denounced as scandalous. Her eyes are kind and good. I will make pretext to stay. Leicester must soon be here. Lady Marian. You shall not go away; I will buy your mignonette—yes, the whole basketful— And you can sit with me till things come to a lull. Phoebe. Lady, you are most good. [She sits in a corner. (Enter General Bellingham.) General Bellingham. My dear, I bring good news From the rebel camp. Their chief has not dared to refuse The message that I sent him. It appears that he Is one well known to us. But (seeing Phoebe)you have company? Lady Marian. It is only a poor girl who brought these flowers. General Bellingham. Well! Well! You shall know all when he comes. A strange tale! a strange tale! But set your mind at ease, my dear. It is to treat The terms of their surrender. There, down in the street I hear them challenging. I will ask you for this room To hold our conference in. Could you, my love, sit dumb While we debate the terms? Or should we worry you? Lady Marian. I will sit behind the screen. I have my own work, too. (To Phoebe.) We will arrange the flowers. [They sit behind the screen. General Bellingham (coming forward). It will be a surprise to her To see who our guest is—the arch-conspirator! She used to like him well, if I remember right, Spite of his mock heroics. Who knows but she might Be of some use to us if he should prove too keen In driving a hard bargain? With this sort of men Women have influence—and Marian is no fool For all her prettiness. That public ass, John Bull, Has small mind here for fighting, and Her Majesty Insists on coming to terms, if terms at all there be. We must try diplomacy. And yet, by God, I swear We will hang you yet, Sir John, or I am no Officer. (Enter an Aide-de-Camp with Leicester, Paul following. Leicester motions Paul to stay in the background.He comes forward. Lady Marian and Phoebe arepartly hidden by the screen.) Scene IV Leicester and Bellingham in front of the stage. The rest out of hearing. A servant brings in wine. Leicester. Good morning, Sir. Bellingham. Good morning. Sit down, General, I am glad to see you here. Years pass, but after all They leave us not much older. No, upon my word, I find you hardly changed. Leicester. You sent for me, my lord? Bellingham. To talk this business over. We must find a plan Less tragical than fighting. Here, as man with man, It should be an easy thing to come to honest terms. We are neither of us tyros in the trade of arms, And can afford to treat without false modesty. You will have a glass of wine? What! No? Leicester. Sir, pardon me, I do not drink. Bellingham. At all! Why, in our fighting days You were counted a good man in this as in most ways. Leicester. I find it wiser so. Bellingham. Nor smoke? Here is a brand You with your Eastern ways, no doubt, will understand. [Leicester refuses. By the soul of Wellington, the man is off his head. He neither smokes nor drinks. It is all true what was said. [Pouring out for himself. I am younger still than you. I give you, Sir, “The Queen.” Leicester. The Queen with all my heart. (Aside.) The one that might have been— Bellingham. There, that was better spoken. We shall find the way To make a fair deal yet. Forgive me if I say, Leicester, how strange it seems, you who were one of us In all your thoughts and feelings, not more scrupulous Or proud than the rest were, if I remember right, In taking pleasant things in the most pleasant light, A good man for all sport with saddle, rod, and gun, And popular too with the women—when all is said and done, An Officer of the Guards—that you should choose to spend Your life in such a way—I speak as an old friend And husband of my wife, who was your friend once too— You will not have forgotten Marian?—that just you Should take so strange a turn, I cannot make it out. You must despise it all, the lunatics that shout, The fools that follow you, the seeing your name in print Always on the noisy side with knaves of every tint And tinge of rascaldom, in furtherance of a cause Always against your order and its social laws— That is the thing astounds me. And then last and worst This rising here at home. Forgive me the outburst, But we all feel it. Now you come to me to treat And say, “The Queen, God bless her.” What is the sense of it? I make appeal to you. You know as well as I The reason why we use our strength unwillingly. There is no glory here to be gained on either side; For these Idealists to fight is suicide, While for ourselves, God knows, we have better work to do Than firing on a mob, even though led by you. Will you not help us then? The Queen is all clemency I give my word for it. Trust her—at least trust me. Leicester. My lord, I feel your kindness. I have not yet lost The sense of early friendships—and of all yours most. It touches me and moves. Be sure, in what I can, Within my line of duty as a serious man Who has a cause to serve which is not quite his own, I am at one with you. Yes. If I stood alone I would not care to bargain, here a little more Or there a little less. I would throw wide the door And let in all your terms unquestioned as they came, Content that they were yours and made in a friend's name. But I am here an agent, one responsible To others for his work. I dare not stop to feel, Or stop to recollect. The Imperial Government Is not a moral force with honourable intent On which a man may lean in perfect confidence. All governments have ways of coming to their ends Right-minded men would scorn. The terms you sent us stood Fair in their general sense. If you can make them good With a more personal pledge on certain points laid down— Reform, the amnesty, our friends here in the town Who have made cause with us and need immunity As well as we ourselves, a pardon plenary In the Queen's royal name, as you suggest, and signed By you on her behalf and with no second mind— I have authority to bring the matter through And on our own side sign,—this without more ado, Only time presses us. See here—our protocol Is easily drawn up. What shall we say? A full And unconditional pardon to all those concerned, Their friends, and their adherents? Bellingham. What, the rogues that burned The Council Hall at York? No, no, you go too fast. Leicester. Exactly those that burned it—all, even the last, There must be no exception. This is not a case Of civil misdemeanour, but of personal grace For acts political. Bellingham. I really must take time To think the matter out. Where there was actual crime You hardly would expect it. Leicester. What is crime? The breach Of an Act of Parliament, which in our common speech We have confused with things theologians once called sin. The criminal? Poor wretch, one whom our discipline Has happened to immesh by rules of evidence, Friends who have sworn against him, or the lack of friends, Not any moral guilt. If I conceded this, What would you do with it? Array your witnesses, Mere common men and fiars till they take the oath, When straight their words are gospel and their stammerings “proof,” And hang the men you hate. No. What is done is done. There must be no law, no crime, but plain oblivion. On this point I am strict. A second is their right Of corporate recognition. These men, if they fight Affirm themselves a section in full form and free. Winning they would shake the base of England's monarchy, Perhaps all thrones in Europe, for the popular will Is with them in their task. Bellingham. Of rolling stones uphill! This really passes all. The claim is too absurd. Leicester. We do not claim so much. We put aside the sword, And enter on new paths of plain legality, Converting not coercing. You have proposed it. We Propose in turn a status, a frank recognition Of rights political in line with our condition, In a word we ask a Charter, will you give it us, My lord? Again time presses. Bellingham. 'Tis preposterous. Leicester. And the alternative? Bellingham. Relief through Parliament. Leicester (raising his voice.) Relief, Sir, through damnation. Time is idly spent In riding that old warhorse. Look to its broken knees. Phoebe (aside). Well spoken, Leicester. Now, who doubts his sympathies? Who doubts his loyalty? He is true, and true to me. Lady Marian (aside). Leicester. It is his voice. Bellingham. We hardly shall agree, General, I fear, this way. Leicester. As you please, my lord. I go. [Moves as if to go. Bellingham. I had hoped for better things. Yet, if it must be so, I suppose it must. This fight, the blood shed here to-day In the streets of this great city, 'tis you shed it, not they; The ruin and destruction, war and civil war, All the long hates engendered there is no reason for, All this lies on your head. Remember, Sir, on yours— The responsible cause of evils far beyond our cures. Yet, Leicester, take my hand. I acknowledge your good heart. I would have us part as friends. Ay, and before we part I would like you to see her. Leicester. Who? Lady Marian? Bellingham. Yes, Marian, my wife. She would resent the plan Which left her wholly out. She often talks of you, And always with kind feeling, just as she used to do. Leicester. (who is looking at the clock). I must be back at noon. Bellingham. That clock is ten minutes fast, You have an hour to spare. I will tell her to make haste, Indeed she is here now. [Goes behind the screen and talks aside with Marian. Scene V Leicester. To be or not to be? To see her or not see her? What fatality! A trouble dogs my steps in all this episode. I seem to hear a voice pleading twixt bad and good, A voice as of a conscience. But the question lies Still on which side right is, the unwise and the wise. The common run of men when they are in doubt say “No.” I always have said “Yes.” It has been my rule to go When others have hung back, to speak where they sat dumb, To confront the imprudent thing they called too venturesome, And always with success. What is she, Marian, That I should fear to-day to see her? I a man Broken to women's wiles? Yet I mistrust me here. My heart beats at her name. (Bellingham enters with Marian.) Leicester (withdrawing). My lord, to be sincere— Marian (aside). He has forgotten me. Leicester (to Bellingham). I have no time to wait. No, Lady Bellingham. It is too unfortunate, To-day of all the days. Bellingham. She has something she would say In reference to this business. Be persuaded. Stay, If only for five minutes. Paul (pushing forward in Leicester's ear). Pay no heed to them. These people are rogues all. Leicester (impatiently). Sir! Paul. 'Tis a stratagem. Their wish is to detain you. Come away from hence. Beware, Sir, of the woman. Leicester. Damn his insolence! This is too much—too much. This youth's ill-tempered game Decides me to stay on. My Lady Bellingham, I am wholly at your orders. (Aside.) Fate has said its word. Bellingham. I leave you two together. You will want no third To talk it out. Paul. Just so. I said he was a traitor. He will wait dangling on, her aider and abettor, Until the hour is past. (Aloud.) The Council shall know this. Leicester. Go on. I follow you. Phoebe. I will see what the end is. [Exeunt all but Leicester and Marian. Phoebe in the background hidden. Scene VI Lady Marian. How strange we should have met. Sit down and talk to me, Just for a short five minutes, nicely, quietly, As in old times. You know what day it is to-day, Our anniversary? Leicester. Yes. Lady Marian. We both have much to say, And little time to say it. Where shall we begin? But first of all believe me it was no fault of mine They claimed me for this talk. Their thought was to deceive, But I am not with them. I only of course grieve And want to help and warn you. Must you really go? Leicester. I am bound and more than bound. What would you have me do? You know I do not blame you, not for this at least. Lady Marian. Men must arrange their lives as they know and think best, And I have sympathised as far as a woman dare, Who has no politics, whose duty lies elsewhere, In all that you have done. I hate to think you wrong, You with your great ideas, so generous, so strong. Oh no! It was not this. And yet I weep to think How wide we are apart, you standing on the brink Of what they will call crime, and I in the camp with those Who every day are counted your more bitter foes, Yes, even Bellingham, your friend, as I was too. This is my grief. Leicester. And yet you drove me from you. You! Lady Marian. No, no. You do me wrong. Unjust! Unkind! A man! You were too quick with me, too eager in your plan. You did not give me time to learn your happiness. And then too unforgiving. Oh, you did not guess, And how was I to tell you? Leicester. You loved me then? Lady Marian. Who knows? If you had had more patience with my woman's woes? Leicester. Marian! [He takes her hand and sits beside her. Lady Marian. Yes, it is yours. Your little white left hand, The one I gave you once. Do you now understand How hard it was for me that morning to say no? How bitter when you left me? Leicester. Was it really so? Were you not callous then, not cruel, not unkind? Lady Marian. How could you fancy it? Oh, truly, men are blind. Unless we write a label to each idle scene, They see in our lives nothing—never the might-have-been, Never the inner thought in instinct with their own. Leicester. And is it still mine, this? (Kissing her hand.) Lady Marian. It has been given to none. Leicester. Nor lent? Lady Marian. Nor lent—it is yours if you like still, Only, too late, too late. Leicester (half aloud). Too late! Incredible That it should come like this—the hour foreseen, foreknown, The hour of all the hours my fortune counted on— And only to delude—for lack of what? The leisure Of a few foolish minutes cheated of their pleasure, Whereby I lose a world. (Taking her hand—then after a pause.) How beautiful it is This hand, the holiest of human mysteries, With its five delicate tips, each one a separate fate Worth all the world's desire, so frail, so passionate, So full of sentient life—and for one moment mine To have and hold, my own, a precious thing, divine Beyond all human hope. What are the joys men prize? Ambition, glory, duty? Empty mummeries! Even in their best ideals! Nothing to this sweet hand That soul or reasoning sense should care to understand, (Kissing her hand.) Nothing, nothing, nothing! Lady Marian. You have my glove still? Leicester. See, Here in my hat it flies, my flag of victory, And never yet defeated. 'Tis an amulet, The superstitious say, preserving from defeat, As long as she who gave it shall remain unkind. Lady Marian. To-day it has lost virtue. She has changed her mind. It only can undo you. [She takes it from his hat and puts it in her bosom. Phoebe. He has given it her! Ah, God! He has betrayed. [She covers her face with her hands—then rises hurriedly and goes out. Leicester (rising). I heard a sound in there As of one weeping. No? Lady Marian (calling). Rosina! There is none. The room is empty. Leicester. Sweet, time is I should be gone. Bid me to say good-bye. I have no strength to go. [Embracing her. Henceforth we are each other's for all weal and woe, Throughout time and eternity. You swear it? On the faith Of all that we have suffered? In this life and death, And till the day of Judgment to be lead and true, And live for our sole love? Lady Marian. I swear it. Leicester. Sweet, adieu. This fight shall be my last. If I prove victor, well My fame shall be my dowry—large and laudable In the face of all the world. The world forgives success, It will forgive our love its sin of happiness. Defeated we elude them. Lady Marian. The Queen's clemency Is not invoked in vain where men fail honourably. Leicester. Or fall? No matter, love. The battle lost or won Seals our great victory. (A cannon shot is heard.) Great God! the signal gun. Curtain. ACT III Scene I Interior of a Church—Davis, Bradshaw, and others. Davis. The sword of the Lord and the sword of Gideon! It was good To see the red-coats run before our multitude. We broke them by sheer numbers— Bradshaw. Say the Almighty's power. Davis. Yes, and our bodily weight, in less than half an hour. Oh! if the people knew the brute strength of their hands, There would be no more kings propped up by tolerance, No more of these mad soldiers. All night long they sat Taking God's name in vain, a devil's syndicate, Roaring and ranting out their music-hall lewd songs In stark profanity. I heard them—their rank tongues Hissing with imprecations, foul, libidinous, Till the night stank. Bradshaw. God's hand has been stretched out to us Because we prayed. Davis. 'Twas great. And Leicester at the nick Appearing on their flank. The chief was choleric To-day to a good purpose, and his rage struck home. He came on like a madman. Bradshaw. He was late to come— Davis. But not too late. They say he escaped by miracle From the arrest they planned him. The Queen's General Had set his wife to trap him, but he knew their ways And broke out of their hands in the fair lady's face. And once on horseback! Ha! They dared not bar his road, The chief is a great soldier. Bradshaw. And a man of good? Hum. There are some distrust him. His past life— Davis. Is past. To-day he is one with us; his lot with ours is cast, A rebel and a martyr—what would you have more? He has unsheathed his sword against the sovereign power, He cannot now go back. Bradshaw. In things political, Perhaps. But of the spirit? Deeds are of light avail When the man's wanton heart lives unregenerate. Davis. We need him for a leader. Our cause trembles yet. Bradshaw. In the Almighty's balance, not in Man's. (Ho, there! You with the blunderbuss, keep the door fast.) 'Tis prayer Not prowess wins the day, virtue not violence, Or how should we have prospered? Davis. God needs means for ends. Leicester's his instrument. But hark—the shouts—the drums, It sounds like victory. See—the conquering hero comes. Scene II Doors are thrown open. Enter Leicester and others. Paul and Phoebe in the background. Davis. Is it over? Leicester. For the moment they are driven back. According to the tactics all young armies lack, Having got them on the run we should have kept them there, But without guns or cavalry we had no luck to spare, And so may shout a bit though not clear of the wood. Bradshaw. Thank God for a great victory. Leicester. Ay, indeed, thank God. (Aside.) It was a narrow shave, none more surprised than I To see them trun their backs. Bradshaw. The cause and liberty! (They cheer.) Davis. You are a great man, Leicester. Leicester. Nonsense. It was luck. War is but pitch and toss. I came in with the ruck, Just as the battle turned and gave it a last shove. Paul. (advancing) With whose hand? Yours? Or whose? The little left-hand glove, Your badge of victory, was in the front to-day, With a new miracle. Leicester. Sir! Paul. So the vulgar say. I did not myself see the angel with the sword, The angel with the glove, commissioned of the Lord, Yet all vow the glove did it. One more victory! For the little white left hand! Shout, comrades, lustily The little left-hand glove! All. The Glove! Paul. Ay, shout again, The noise will do you good. (Aside.) Such happy fools are men. Look at it! (Points at Leicester's cap.) Bradshaw. Where? Davis. 'Tis gone. Bradshaw. The glove is lost. Paul. Or strayed. It has wandered gaily back to its fellow glove, mislaid. Leicester. It is true the badge is gone. I dropped it in the press. (To Paul.) Why, Sir, this insolence? Luck holds us none the less. It shall forgive this loss, this lapse,— Paul. With other sins. Bradshaw. What does he mean? Paul. You laugh. Leicester. Sir, let him laugh who wins. This boy is beyond bearing. To your sense as men I turn me from this fooling. Bradshaw. What is it, Paul? Paul. Hear then, Our leader talks of fooling. Which is the fool, think you, The man that does and dares, that fights at the time due, Or he that plays with harlots, till the hour is past? Ay, or is played with by them, comes in at the last, Just as the act is over and the stage scene drops, To gather in the pence and share the lollipops? The chief is a great soldier, but the game of war Is not the only trick of his soul's repertoire. Alas for the poor ladies—when he mows them down! A wonderful fighting man! Heaven help the overthrown. Leicester. (advancing) Now by the Lord Almighty! [Menaces Paul. Davis. (intervening). Paul, have done with this. Time is and place for all things. Paul. Ay, a time to kiss! A time to toy and trifle! To make amorous strife At a fair lady's knees, and she a neighbour's wife! Oh glorious ideal for the Idealists! Davis. Enough, good Paul. To-morrow— [Others intervene. They struggle with Paul. Paul. Let them go, my wrists. [Turning on Leicester. I charge him with the obscene! [They drag him away. Bradshaw. The obscene? Paul. (as they thrust him out) Adultery! Leicester. (aside) The boy knows nothing. Marian? No, it cannot be. He fires at a mere venture. (Aloud.) Gentlemen, I pray, Relieve me of this trifling—for at least to-day. I know of no such failure. 'Tis an ugly word. I know of no such mistress, none, Sir, but my sword. (Aside.) Marian must be protected. (Aloud.) In my earlier time, Who knows, I may have fooled it. Love was not a crime In the company I kept. But here, among you all, No, Sirs, upon my life, we keep no festival, We none have time for folly. Comrades, once again, Remember we are fighting. Let us act as men, Not boys, till it is over. When we have grasped our fate Then we may hound each other with our love and hate To our best heart's content, but not this battle day. Back, all men to the field! All. Hurray! the chief! hurray! [They hurry out Scene III Phoebe is left alone—she walks up and down for some instants in silence. Then passionately. Phoebe. It moves me still to hear him. Was it a dream I saw, A dream, or an enchantment, a mysterious flaw In my eyes' judgment? What? Paul, who saw nothing, swears All that I saw and more. Her lover, he declares, She his once paramour, his fast confederate still. What is the truth? Ah, God! We see but what we will. We think but what we choose. We have no certain guide But our own heart's desire at death-grips with our pride. Paul always hated him. I loved him as a flower Loves the white sunlight, ay as a wave of the sea the power Of the storm shaking it, as a child's voice loves the sound Of its own echo shouted from the hills around,— As something loftier, mightier than itself, divine And far beyond these arms to reach to or entwine, Far, far beyond these tears. And yet I saw him, how? He held her in his arms. Their lips touched—yes—I vow He kissed her on her lips—a woman not his own, One plighted to another—and she did not frown, Nor chide, nor strike. She was pleased—ay, pleased—she smiled at him, And he at her. I have seen a soul lost, one of the Seraphim Cast out into the darkness, a crime done to law, A sacrament profaned! All this with my eyes I saw. And yet, yet. Paul denounced him, he did well, but I, I could not move my lips. I felt it treachery. He would have scorned me had I spoken—he would have said It was a girl's foolish jealousy had turned my head. What to him are our laws, our thoughts, our consciences? Even now I dare not grieve him or take part with these. I could not be a witness. Yet the faith? the cause? I am in doubt of all things, of all faiths, all laws, All duties, even of pain. I know not how to act, Seeing the world thus shortened of the love it lacked, Of virtue, truth, obedience. I must await some sign. A flash of light may come, a wisdom more than mine. God may inspire my hand if he leaves blind my heart. [A sound of cannon is heard and of fighting approaching nearer. Phoebe. (looking out into the street) They are fighting by the Court House and the Cattle Mart. The dragoons have turned on them. They are charging up the street. They are riding down our people, every one they meet, Men, women, children, all. There must be many dead. The crowd waves like a field cut down and harvested. Ah God! If we should fail—if we indeed should fail! If this should end it all! Our faith of no avail! Our life's design a dream! And we deserve it. See What sins we have sinned through weakness, through inconstancy. Complicity in wrong! And he, where is he? There! That was a cannon shot. The shell burst in the air Above their heads. They fly from it! Our people fly! What am I doing here? They are on us! Let me die! Oh, let me die with them! [She rushes to the door, but it is burst open in her face, and a crowd of fugitives pours in, with whom Davis and Bradshaw. Phoebe is thrust aside and sinks on the ground by the door, where she remains crouched. Scene IV Bradshaw. All's lost. All's lost. Davis. How? What? Is it true we are betrayed? I warned you of the plot. The chief is where? Bradshaw. He's taken. It was an ambuscade The reds had laid for him in the new esplanade. They made a feint of flying, and he followed on And fell into their trap— Davis. Like any tailor's son. I told you he was a traitor. We have been bought and sold. Paul said it. Where is Paul? Bradshaw. Where we shall be—enrolled In Heaven among the saints. His last word as he fell Was “Fight on for the Ideal, and the reds to Hell!” He had his eye on Leicester. He was close behind him, And when the chief surrendered. Bah! It seemed to blind him. The blood rushed to his eyes. They shouted, “Hands up, boy,” But he only laughed at them with a new furious joy And ran upon their swords. And so they ran him through. Davis. The boy was a good hater. A voice. And a comrade true. If all had been like him! Bradshaw. A curse is on our state Because we gave our trust to one a reprobate, In whom we all have sinned. A voice. Let us repent and pray! [They put themselves in an attitude of prayer, the doors are again thrown open and enter Sergeant Mullens and Corporal Carver with a detachment of soldiers, and Leicester as their prisoner. Scene V Mullens. Surrender, every man! Here, Corporal, clear the way, Take all the rogues in charge; this is the rebel lot And these the ringleaders, and give them something hot. They want a bit of schooling. Use the butt, men. There! You have left them sensible with half their wits to spare. [The soldiers club their muskets and cudgel the crowd It is a good rule always in affairs like these To give a drubbing first. Then you may stand at ease And wait for the Court's verdict with a tranquil mind. The prisoner goes acquitted, but he's sore behind. Round them up, Carver, so, under the pulpit screen. Carver. (putting a guard over them) Lie still, ye happy scoundrels, prisoners of the Queen! We'll teach ye to rebel. Mullens. That is enough. They'll sit As quiet now as mice, while we take stock a bit. (To Leicester deferentially.) You, General, take a seat kindly in this front pew; It will save me setting a guard to have you here in view, And you are not like these. You will excuse my tongue For its rough edge. (To his men.) Come, boys—I'm thirsty as a bung. It's been a thirsty morning, thirsty work all round, Who'll show us to a drink? You, prisoners, I'll be bound, Know where the publics are. If there's a house near by, In God's name, name it us. Bradshaw. Silence. Make no reply. Davis. They have got us by the neck — it's time to temporise. Mullens. What? None of you know nothing? One of the Prisoners. There's the “Compasses” At the next corner, Sir, and the “Imperial Crown,” And the old “Fighting Cocks,” the best name in the town, They're all within a stone's throw. Another Prisoner. Give us leave a minute. We'll show you the way gaily. Mullens. There's no money in it, You understand, young man. We're on the loot this turn. Prisoner. Money or not, they'll serve you. Mullens. That they'll have to learn. (To the soldiers.) Come, Joyce and Parsons, you run out with this good chap And bring a can back handy from the nearest tap. I've got a thirst that kills me. Leicester. You're a cheerful fellow, And should receive promotion. Here's a bit of yellow To make the matter sure. I'll stand you all your stuff. Mullens. General, we thank you kindly. (To Joyce and Prisoner.) Off! and bring enough. (To Leicester.) I like these ways in war, “My friend the enemy,” That's a good motto, Sir, or where would soldiers be? You were out of luck to-day. But you are a hero, Sir, You must serve the Queen again, and cut the bushranger. Leicester. (aside) The fellow strikes me hard, but I must humour him. (Aloud.) I seem to knw you, Sergeant, though my memory's dim, We've served together somewhere. Where was it? Your face Is quite familiar to me. Mullens. Sir John Leicester. Yes, You honour me by naming and remembering it. If I might make so bold, and it was not indiscreet, I should say we have been comrades, served under the same flag. Leicester. Which? Mullens. Sir, the noblest known, though it's not for me to brag, We have fought in company, and won together, won In the only cause worth winning. Yes, indeed, Sir John, I am proud to think of it. Love is a leveller. Leicester. You mystify me fairly. Mullens. How shall I tell you, Sir? You have heard the name Rosina? Leicester. (aside) What does the coxcomb mean? (Aloud.) Rosina? Mullens. Yes, Rosina. Her Majesty the Queen Has her fair maids-in-waiting, and all ladies have. Service is no reproach. You, General, are brave, And ladies love the brave, and maids are as they are, And women are—just women. So they are young and fair And not too whimsical, they make our happiness. Oh, we have served together— Leicester. God! Has it come to this? Rosina! Marian's maid! It would be too laughable In any strait less dire. The insolent dog! (Aloud.) Well, well! You shall drink the lady's health. (Re-enter Joyce and the rest with a quarter cask.) Mullens. Here comes the liquor, boys. Three cheers for Sir John Leicester. Shout! Don't spare the noise! (They pour out and drink. Enter Marian and Rosina.) And three cheers for the ladies. [They shout Scene VI Lady Marian. (aside to Leicester) Thank God, you are here. Rosina. And Sergeant Mullens too—as senior Officer. Lady Marian. (advancing to Mullens). You are in charge here, Sergeant? This is a happy chance. Mullens. My lady—and Rosina! (Saluting.) Ladies, at your commands. (To Marian.) My Lady Bellingham, your servant. Lady Marian. We have come Straight from Headquarters, Sergeant. General Bellingham Has sent us with a message. All the fighting line Is ordered to fall back, whether outside or in The precincts of the town, and they are stopping fire Already in the streets—this by the Queen's desire, Resistance being at an end. My special message was, To the first Officer I should chance to come across, To order in all prisoners taken instantly To the General at Headquarters. He desires to see The rebel chief at once. You have with you a few It seems of the most important. I make my bow to you, Sergeant, on your good luck. I will see to it you get Your brevet for this capture. Who knows?—an epaulet, Or even the V.C. Mullens. My Lady. I am yours, Entirely to command. Lady Marian. One of your prisoners I would have a word with, Sergeant, while you rank the rest. I will take a seat here. See—Rosina is distressed That you have not noticed her. Five minutes and we start. Rosina, go with him. The girl has got a heart, Sergeant, and loves you. There—she was frightened in the street And wants some comforting. Be her good paraclete, Give her a kind word. Say you love her—she will believe it— Then make your men fall in. I won't forget the brevet. Scene VII Mullens crosses the stage with Rosina, who drinks a glass with him, and they talk together while the soldiers leisurely put the prisoners in line, Marian sits down by Leicester. Lady Marian. I have come to save your life—thank God, you are alive— And take you from their hands. Be prudent, and forgive, If I have dared too much. A price is on your head, Yours only, all the others being amnestied By the Queen's clemency. My husband means you harm. You must not come before him while his blood is warm And you his prisoner. Listen—I have a plan, Set with my maid Rosina, whose lover is this man The sergeant of your guard. She will have him occupied When the moment comes for action. Keep close to my side As we march out with them, and when we reach the street Mount in my carriage with me, quick. We must brazen it As part of my lord's orders they must all obey. They will not dare to stop us. Once we are clear away, The game is in our hands. My name will pass us through. Leicester. (hesitating) You are an angel, Marian, what can I say to you? How thank you? How make clear? Lady Marian. You seem to hesitate. Look at those men (pointing to the soldiers drinking). What hinders? Leicester. Nothing, but my fate. I shall die happy, Marian, but I cannot fly. My hour of fate has sounded. Lady Marian. Die? You shall not die, You shall live to make me happy. Leicester. My duty lies with these (pointing to the prisoners). Lady Marian. And mine with Bellingham, O man of subtleties! Yet I am here for what? To save you from his hands. These foolish souls are safe. Their manifest madness stands Between them and the law which asks no punishment More than their folly finds them. The Queen's grace was sent An hour ago to all. And you? You would die forlorn, The only unbeliever, for a creed you scorn? What sense is there, what wit? Leicester. The wit of one that is Weary of all things less than full realities, Weary of only seeming in a world of dreams. You gave me once a hope. Where did it lead? To schemes That never had an issue, impotent desires That burst into no flame and lit no kindred fires And left me what I am, a wifeless, childless man Depraved by his own virtue, a new d'Artagnan Without the Gascon faith in his unchastity. My fame has been false glory, my romance a lie, My world's career a sham. To-day I am face to face At last with a hard fact—defeat, disdain, disgrace, The loud voice of the world dealing a traitor's death. Why should I shrink from it more than the victor's wreath, It set upon my brows? I stand where all in turn Are forced, to honest dealing and the wage they earn. Death has its own heroics, real, sublimely real. I will not be dissuaded. 'Tis my last ideal. Lady Marian. Not even by my love, my whole and utter love? Leicester. Perhaps not even by that. You gave me once your glove, Give it me back, sweetheart! My fortune has gone out. Lady Marian. It is here and it shall save you. (She takes it from her bosom and places it in his hat.) Why should you now doubt Your star which led to glory, and with me your friend Henceforward at your side to point to each high end, And aid you to achieve it. We have much to win Together in the world of more worth than the sin Of our great happiness—a fact which yet shall be. Follow me quick. It is yours. [She gives him her left hand which he lays upon his heart. He holds back, but she draws him towards her kissing his hands, and he gradually yields. Leicester. This is reality. Lead on. [She leads him towards the door, and the soldiers form up behind them with the prisoners; but as they reach it Phoebe rises and intercepts them. A pistol shot is heard, and Leicester falls as the curtain drops. Curtain. THE WISDOM OF MERLYN These are the time-words of Merlyn, the voice of his age recorded, All his wisdom of life, the fruit of tears in his youth, of joy in his manhood hoarded, All the wit of his years unsealed, to the witless alms awarded. These are his time-gifts of song, his help to the heavy-laden, Words of an expert of life, who has gathered its sins in his sack, its virtues to grieve and gladden, Speaking aloud as one who is strong to the heart of man, wife and maiden. For he is Merlyn of old, the once young, the still robed in glory, Ancient of days though he be, with wisdom only for wealth and the crown of his locks grown hoary, Yet with the rage of his soul untamed, the skill of his lips in story. He dares not unhouselled die, who has seen, who has known, who has tasted What of the splendours of Time, of the wise wild joys of the Earth, of the newness of pleasures quested, All that is neither of then nor now, Truth's naked self clean-breasted, Things of youth and of strength, the Earth with its infinite pity, Glories of mountain and plain, of streams that wind from the hills to the insolent human city, Dark with its traders of human woe enthroned in the seats of the mighty. Fair things nobler than Man before the day of his ruling, Free in their ancient peace, ere he came to change, to destroy, to hinder with his schooling, Asking naught that was his to give save freedom from his fooling. Beautiful, wonderful, wise, a consonant law-ruled heaven, Garden ungardened yet, in need yet hardly of God to walk there noon or even, Beast and bird and flower in its place, Earth's wonders more than seven. Of these he would speak and confess, to the young who regard not their heirship, Of beauty to boys who are blind, of might to the impotent strong, to the women who crowd Time's fair ship, Of pearls deep hid in Love's Indian seas, the name of the God they worship. Thus let it be with Merlyn before his daylight is ended, One last psalm of his life, the light of it lipped with laughter, the might of it mixed and blended Still with the subtle sweet need of tears than Pleasure's self more splendid, Psalm and hymn of the Earth expounding what Time teaches, Creed no longer of wrath, of silent issueless hopes, of a thing which beyond Man's reach is, Hope deferred till the heart grows sick, while the preacher vainly preaches. Nay but a logic of life, which needeth no deferring, Life with its birthright love, the sun the wind and the rain in multiple pleasure stirring Under the summer leaves at noon, with no sad doubt of erring, No sad legend of sin, since his an innocent Eden Is, and a garden of grace, its gateway clear of the sword, its alleys not angel-ridden, Its tree of life at the lips of all and never a fruit forbidden. Merlyn is no vain singer to vex men's ears in the street, Nay, nor a maid's unbidden. He importuneth none with his song, be it never so wild and sweet. She that hath ears to hear, let her hear; he will not follow her feet. Merlyn makes no petition. He asketh of no man alms. Prince and prophet is he, a monarch, a giver of gifts, a lord of the open plams, Sueth he naught, not at God's own hand, though he laudeth the Lord in psalms. Merlyn would speak his message only to hearts that are strong, To him that hath courage to climb, who would gather time's samphire flowers, who would venture the crags among. To her who would lesson her soul to fear, with love for sermon and song. Merlyn hath arms of pity, the weak he would hold to his soul, Make them partakers of truth, of the ancient weal of the Earth, of the life-throb from Pole to Pole. He would hold them close; he would dry their tears; with a kiss he would make them whole. Thus would he sing and to thee, thou child with the eyes of passion Watching his face in the dark, in the silent light of the stars, while he in his godlike fashion Maketh his mock at the fears of men, nor spareth to lay the lash on. Thus would thy Merlyn devise, ere the days of his years be numbered, Now at threescore and ten. He would leave his word to the world, his soul of its load uncumbered. Then would he lay his ear to the grave, and sleep as his childhood slumbered. What is the fruit of Wisdom? To learn the proportion of things; To know the ant from the lion, the whale from the crest of the wave, the ditty the grasshopper sings From the chaunt of the full-fledged Paradise bird as he shakes the dew from his wings. There is one thing more than knowledge, a harvest garnered by few: To tutor the heart to achieve, to fashion the act to the hand, to do and not yearn to do, To say to the wish of the soul “I will,” to have gathered the flower where it grew. I was young, and they told me “Tarry. The rash in the nets are taken. If there be doubt of thy deed, abstain, lest the day of danger behold thee by these forsaken, Lest thou lie in the lion's den thou hast roused, with the eyes thou hast dared to waken.” They spake, but I answered “Nay, who waiteth shall take no quarry. Pleasure is fleet as the roe; in the vales he feedeth to-day, but at nightwhen the eyes grow weary Lo, he hath passed to the desolate hills; he is gone. Nay, he may not tarry.” For Joy too needeth a net. He cometh tame to thy hand, Asketh an alms of thy life, to serve thee, thy jubilant slave, if thou wouldst but understand. Then is thy moment, O Man, for the noose, be it steel or a silken band. Therefore, where doubt is, do! Thou shalt stumble in thine endeavour, Ay, till thy knees be sore, thy back with the arrows of grief, and thou stand with an empty quiver. Yet shall thy heart prevail through its pain, for pain is a mastering lever. Wouldst thou be wise, O Man? At the knees of a woman begin. Her eyes shall teach thee thy road, the worth of the thing called pleasure, the joy of the thing called sin. Else shalt thou go to thy grave in pain for the folly that might have been. For know, the knowledge of women the beginning of wisdom is. Who had seven hundred wives and concubines hundreds three, as we read in the book of bliss? Solomon, wisest of men and kings, and “all of them princesses.” Yet, be thou stronger than they. To be ruled of a woman is ill. Life hath an hundred ways, beside the way of her arms, to give thee of joy thy fill. Only is love of thy life the flower. Be thine the ultimate will. A right way is to be happy, a wrong way too. Then beware. Leave the colt in his stall, he shall grow to a thankless jade, be he never so fat and fair. Sloth is a crime. Rise up, young fool, and grasp thy joy by the hair. What is the motto of youth? There is only one. Be thou strong. Do thy work and achieve, with thy brain, with thy hands, with thy heart, the deeds which to strength belong. Strike each day thy blow for the right, or failing strike for the wrong. He that would gain let him give. The shut hand hardly shall win. Open thy palms to the poor, O thou of the indigent heart. There shall pleas ure be poured therein. Use thy soul to the cord of joy. If thou sin must, strongly sin. Cast thy whole heart away. The Earth, philosophers tell, Leaps to a pebble thrown, be it never so little; it moved to the bidding of that which fell. Throw thy heart! Thou shalt move the world, though thou fall on the floor of Hell. Few have the courage of loving. Faint hearts! The loss is theirs. Few of their idlest whims. “I would win to Rome ere I die,” one cried in his daily cares, Yet plods on on 'Change to his grave, the slave of his stocks and shares. Learn to appraise thy desires, to weigh the wares of thy heart. If thou wouldst play with pleasure, avoid Love's passionate tides, its perilous Ocean chart, Hug the shores of Love's inland seas, and buy thy joys in the mart. Love lightly, but marry at leisure. Wild Love is a flower of the field Waiting all hands to gather and ours. If we leave it another will win it and kneel where we kneeled. Marriage is one tame garden rose in a garden fenced and sealed. O thou who art sitting silent! Youth, with the eyelids of grief! How shall I rouse thee to wit? Thou hast stolen the joy of our world. Thouscornest its vain relief. Nay, she is here. Be thy tongue set free. Play up, thou eloquent thief. Doubt not thy absolution, sinner, who darest to sin. So thou prevail in the end, she shall hold thee guiltless of guile, a hero, a paladin. The end in her eyes hath thee justified, whatever thy means have been. Love is of body and body, the physical passion of joy; The desire of the man for the maid, her nakedness strained to his own; the mother's who suckles her boy With the passionate flow of her naked breast. All else is a fraudulent toy. Of the house where Love is the master thy beauty may hold the key. It shall open the hall-door wide, shout loud thy name to its lord. Yet, wouldst thou its full guest be, Bring with thee other than beauty, wit. Then sit at the feast made free. “To talk of love is to make love.” Truly, a maxim of price. Nathless the noblest soul, shouldst thou tell her of passionate things and fail to gaze in her eyes, Shall hold thee cheap in her woman's pride, a clown for thy courtesies. Love hath two mountain summits, the first where pleasure was born Faint in the cloud-land of light, a vision of possible hope; the second a tempest-torn Crag where passion is lord and king. Betwixt them what vales forlorn! Happiness needs to be learned. In youth the ideal woman Gazed at afar was a dream, a priceless untouchable prize, while she in your arms, too human, Mocked you with love. 'Tis an art learned late; alas, and the whole by no man. O! thou in the purple gendered. Thou needst pain for thy case. Lose thy health or thy heart. Be bowed in thy soul's despond. Be whelmed in a world's disgrace. So shall thy eyes be unsealed of pride and see Love face to face. If thou wouldst win love, speak. She shall read the truth on thy lips. Spoken vows shall prevail, the spell of thy eloquent hand, the flame of thy finger-tips. Write? She is reading another's eyes while thy sad pen dips and dips. Thou hast ventured a letter of passion, in ease of thy passionate heart? Nay, be advised; there is fear, mischance in the written word, when lovers are far apart. Pain is betrayed by the subtle pen where lips prevailed without art. Love is a fire. In the lighting, it raiseth a treacherous smoke, Telling its tale to the world; but anon, growing clear in its flame, may be hid by an old wife's cloak, And the world learn nothing more and forget the knowledge its smouldering woke. Comes there a trouble upon thee? Be silent, nor own the debt. Friendship kicks at the goda; thy naked state is its shame; thou hast angered these with thy fret. Wait. The world shall forgive thy sin. It asks but leave to forget. The world is an indolent house-shrew. It scolds but cares not to know Whether in fancy or fact. What it thinks we have done, that it scourges; the true thing we did it lets go. What matter? We fare less ill than our act, ay, all of us; more be our woe! There are days when wisdom is witless, when folly is noble, sublime. Let us thank the dear gods for our madness, the rush of the blood in our veins, the exuberant pulsings of Time, And pray, while we sin the forbidden sin, we be spared our penance of crime. There are habits and customs of passion. Long loves are a tyrannous debt. But to some there is custom of change, the desire of the untrodden ways, with sunshine of days that were wet, Of the four fair wives of love's kindly law by licence of Mahomet. Experience all is of use, save one, to have angered a friend. Break thy heart for a maid; another shall love thee anon. The gold shall return thou didst spend, Ay, and thy beaten back grow whole. But friendship's grave is the end. Why do I love thee, brother? We have shared what things in our youth, Battle and siege and triumph, together, always together, in wanderings North and South. But one thing shared binds nearer than all, the kisses of one sweet mouth. He that hath loved the mother shall love the daughter no less, Sister the younger sister. There are tones how sweet to his ear, gestures that plead and press, Echoes fraught with remembered things that cry in the silences. Fly from thy friend in his fortune, his first days of wealth, of fame; Or, if thou needest to meet him, do thou as the children of Noah, walk back wards and guard thee from blame. He who saw found forgiveness none. With thee it were haply the same. Bridegroom, thy pride is unseemly. Thou boastest abroad, with a smile, Thou hast read our humanity's riddle. Nay, wait yet a year with thy bride; she shall lesson thee wiser the while. Then shalt thou blush for thy words to-day, the shame of thy innocent guile. The love of a girl is a taper lit on a windy night. Awhile it lightens our darkness, consoles with its pure sudden flame, and the shadows around it grow white. Anon with a rain-gust of tears it is gone, and we blink more blind for the light. Sage, thou art proud of thy knowledge, what mountains and marvels seen! Thou hast loved how madly, how often! hast known what wiles of the heart, what ways of maid, wife and quean! Yet shalt thou still be betrayed by love, befooled like a boy on the green. Oh, there is honour in all love. Have lips once kissed thee, be dumb, Save in their only praise. To cheapen the thing thou hast loved is to bite at thyself thy thumb, To shout thy own fool's fault to the world, and beat thy shame on a drum. Who hath dared mock at thy beauty, Lady? Who deemeth thee old? If he had seen thee anon in the tender light of thine eyes, as I saw thee, what tales had he told Of ruined kingdoms and kings for one, of misers spending their gold! Friendship or Love? You ask it: which binds with the stronger tether? Friendship? Thy comrade of youth, who laughed with thee on thy road? What ailed him in that rough weather, When to thy bosom Love's angel crept, twin tragedies locked together? Friendship is fostered with gifts. Be it so; little presents? Yes. Friendship! But ah, not Love, since love is itself Love's gift and it angereth him to have less. Woe to the lover who dares to bring more wealth than his tenderness. This to the woman: Forbear his gifts, the man's thou wouldst hold. Cheerfully he shall give and thou nothing guess, yet anon he shall weigh thee in scales of his gold. Woe to thee then if the charge be more than a heartache's cost all told. Thou art tempted, a passion unworthy? Long struggle hath dulled thy brain? How shalt thou save thee, poor soul? How buy back the peace of thy days? If of rest thou be fain, Oft is there virtue in yielding all; thou shalt not be tempted again. Sacrifice truly is noble. Yet, Lady, ponder thy fate. Many a victory, won in tears by her who forbore, hath ruined her soul's estate. Virtue's prize was too dear a whim, the price agreed to too great. Virtue or vice? Which, think you, should need more veil for her face? Virtue hath little fear; she goeth in unchaste guise; she ventureth all disgrace. Poor Vice hid in her shame sits dumb while a stranger taketh her place. Chastity? Who is unchaste? The church-wed wife, without blame Yielding her body nightly, a lack-love indolent prize, to the lord of her legal shame? Or she, the outlawed passionate soul? Their carnal act is the same. In youth it is well thou lovest. The fire in thee burneth strong. Choose whom thou wilt, it kindleth; a beggar-maid or a queen, she shall carry the flame along. Only in age to be loved is best; her right shall repair thy wrong. Lady, wouldst fly with thy lover? Alas, he loves thee to-day. How shall it be to-morrow? He saw thee a bird in the air, a rose on its thorny spray. He would take thee? What shalt thou be in his hand? A burden to bear alway. Women love beauty in women, a thing to uphold, to adore, To vaunt for all womanhood's fame, a seemly sweet fitness of body, adorned with all virtuous lore. Beauty, but not of the kind men prize. On that they would set small store. What is there cruel as fear? A falcon rending her prey Showeth an evil eye, but to him she loveth is kind; her rage she shall put away. But a frightened woman hath pity none. Though she love thee, yet shall she slay. Show not thy sin to thy son. He shall judge thee harder than these. All the servants of Noah beheld his shame in the house and loyally held their peace. Ham alone at his father laughed, made jest of his nakedness. Cast not loose thy religion, whether believing or no. Heavy it is with its rule, a burden laid on thy back, a sombre mask at the show. Yet shall it cloak thee in days of storm, a shield when life's whirlwinds blow. As to the tree its ivy, so virtue is to the soul. All the winter long it clothed us in leafage green, and the forest paid us its toll. Now it is Spring and the rest rejoice while we stand drear in our dole. Thy love of children is well. Yet a peril lurketh therein. See lest thy sloth take excuse of thy fondness. Nay, coward art thou, and thine is the pestilent sin. Shift wouldst thou thy burden of life, the blame of thy “might have been.” Courage we all find enough to bear the mischance of our friends. How many tortured souls have gone to their self-made graves through wreck of their own mad ends: But no man yet hath his weazand slit for his neighbour's pain in amends. Fear not to change thy way, since change is of growth, life's sign. The Child in his growing body, the Sage in his gathered lore, the Saint in his growths divine, All find pleasure but Age which weeps the unchanging years' decline. Whence is our fountain of tears? We weep in childhood for pain, Anon for triumph in manhood, the sudden glory of praise, the giant mastered and slain. Age weeps only for love renewed and pleasure come back again. What is our personal self? A fading record of days Held in our single brain, memory linked with memory back to our childhood's ways. Beyond it what? A tradition blurred of gossip and nursemaid says. Why dost thou plain of thine age, O thou with the beard that is thin? Art thou alone in thy home? Is there none at thy side, not one, to deem thee a man among men? Nay, thou art young while she holds thy hand, be thy years the threescore and ten. The world is untimely contrived. It gives us our sunshine in summer, Its laughing face in our youth, when we need it not to be gay, being each one his own best mummer. All its frown is for life that goes, its smile for the last new comer. Europe a horologe is, ill mounted and clogged with grime, Asia a clock run down. Its hands on the dial are still; its hours are toldby no chime. Nathless, twice in the twenty-four, it shall tell thee exactly the time. What is the profit of knowledge? Ah none, though to know not is pain! We grieve like a child in the dark; we grope for a chink at the door, for a way of escape from the chain; We beat on life's lock with our bleeding hands, till it opens. And where is the gain? I have tried all pleasures but one, the last and sweetest; it waits. Childhood, the childhood of age, to totter again on the lawns, to have done with the loves and the hates, To gather the daisies, and drop them, and sleep on the nursing knees of the Fates. I asked of the wise man “Tell me, what age is the age of pleasure? Twenty years have I lived. I have spread my meshes in vain. I have taken a paltry treasure. Where is the heart of the gold?” And he, “I will tell thee anon at leisure.” I pleaded at thirty “Listen. I have played, I have lost, I have won. I have loved in joy and sorrow. My life is a burden grown with the thought of its sands outrun. Where is the joy of our years? At forty?” “Say it is just begun.” At forty I made love's mourning. I stood alone with my foes, Foot to foot with my Fate, as a man at grips with a man, returning blows for blows. In the joy of battle “'Tis here” I cried. But the wise man, “Nay, who knows?” At fifty I walked sedately. At sixty I took my rest. I had learned the good with the evil. I troubled my soul no more, I had reached the Isles of the Blest. The sage was dead who had warned my fears. I was wise, I too, with the best. What do we know of Being? Our own? How short lived, how base! That which is not our own? The eternal enrolment of stars, the voids and the silences! The enormous might of the mindless globes whirling through infinite space! The infinite Great overhead, the infinite Little beneath! The turn of the cellular germ, the giddy evolving of life in the intricate struggle for breath, The microbe, the mote alive in the blood, the eyeless atom of death! Yet which is the greater Being? We have dreamed of a life-giving God, Him, the mind of the Sun, the conscious brain-flower of Space, with a cosmic form and abode, With thought and pity and power of will, Humanity's ethical code. We have dreamed, but we do not believe. Be He here, be He not, 'tis as one. His Godhead, how does it help? He is far. He is blind to our need. Nay, nay, He is less than the Sun, Less than the least of the tremulous stars, than our old scorned idols of stone. For He heareth not, nor seeth. As we to the motes in our blood, So is He to our lives, a possible symbol of power, a formula half understood. But the voice of Him, where? the hand grip, where? A child's cry lost in a wood. Therefore is Matter monarch, the eternal the infinite Thing, The “I that am” which reigneth, which showeth no shadow of change, while humanities wane and spring, Which saith “Make no vain Gods before me, who only am Lord and King.” What then is Merlyn's message, his word to thee weary of pain, Man, on thy desolate march, thy search for an adequate cause, for a thread, for a guiding rein, Still in the maze of thy doubts and fears, to bring thee thy joy again? Thou hast tried to climb to the sky; thou hast called it a firmament; Thou hast found it a thing infirm, a heaven which is no haven, a bladder punctured and rent, A mansion frail as the rainbow mist, as thy own soul impotent. Thou hast clung to a dream in thy tears; thou hast stayed thy rage with a hope; Thou hast anchored thy wreck to a reed, a cobweb spread for thy sail, with sand for thy salvage rope; Thou hast made thy course with a compass marred, a toy for thy telescope. What hast thou done with thy days? Bethink thee, Man, that alone, Thou of all sentient things, hast learned to grieve in thy joy, hast earned thee the malison Of going sad without cause of pain, a weeper and woebegone. Why? For the dream of a dream of another than this fair life Joyous to all but thee, by every creature beloved in its spring-time of passion rife, By every creature but only thee, sad husband with sadder wife, Scared at thought of the end, at the simple logic of death, Scared at the old Earth's arms outstretched to hold thee again, thou child of an hour, of a breath, Seeking refuge with all but her, the mother that comforteth. Merlyn's message is this: he would bid thee have done with pride. What has it brought thee but grief, thy parentage with the Gods, thy kinship with beasts denied? What thy lore of a life to come in a cloud-world deified? O thou child which art Man, distraught with a shadow of ill! O thou fool of thy dreams, thou gatherer rarely of flowers but of fungi ofevil smell, Posion growths of the autumn woods, rank mandrake and mort-morell! Take thy joy with the rest, the bird, the beast of the field, Each one wiser than thou, which frolic in no dismay, which seize what the seasons yield, And lay thee down when thy day is done content with the unrevealed. Take the thing which thou hast. Forget thy kingdom unseen. Lean thy lips on the Earth; she shall bring new peace to thy eyes with her healing vesture green. Drink once more at her fount of love, the one true hippocrene. O thou child of thy fears! Nay, shame on thy childish part Weeping when called to thy bed. Take cheer. When the shadows come, when the crowd is leaving the mart, Then shalt thou learn that thou needest sleep, Death's kindly arms for thy heart. THE END</field>
