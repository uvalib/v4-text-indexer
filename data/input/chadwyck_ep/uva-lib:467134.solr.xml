      <field name="fulltext">[The secret may be whispered in the shrine] The secret may be whispered in the shrine, Life's central word, or cried in all men's ears Down from the mountain height, it yet is mine: —He only who had heard the secret hears. I THE ROSARY The beads thus at your girdle hung Have little lustre as you see, My verses faintly said or sung, A poor believer's rosary. Yet think for what they stand, nor part With these, if only coloured clay; This meant an Ave from his heart, And this, though pale, a Gloria. II SONG A SHADOW The little breezes of my song Waft perfumes, each a pallid wraith Of hope, of memories treasured long, And ever love, and ever faith: Or think them shadows that across The everlasting hills have run, Whose life was merely sunshine's loss; Yet flying shades confess the sun. III SILENCE AND SPEECH Others, with desolate arms, have flung Their hands to heaven, and cried their grief, And found, because a woe was sung, Sad measured fragments of relief. If such my lot, these lips were dumb; Song were a broken, idle toy; Lean to me, my beloved; come, And hear what may be told of joy. IV A GARDEN INCLOSED My soul a garden is inclosed, But never wall was builded there Save heaven's bright boundary circumposed, The depths of blue untrammell'd air. No garth is guarded half so sure, And here are blossoms for the bee, And here, to make my bourne secure, Horizons of infinity. V THE WELL I stoop'd to many streams that run Through the hot plain, and drank with greed, Lores and new lores!—yet found not one But left some smatch of marish-weed. Blest be this well that holds the heaven Radiant and calm within its breast! Who stoopeth here to him is given Joy at the midmost heart of rest. VI AFAR I saw you then how far away, As one might see at morning's birth Some Oread of strange hills at play On the uplifted rim of earth; Nothing beyond you but the light Of dawn and heaven's pellucid shell; So with God's world, swung clear of night, How should not all be safe and well? VII PREMONITIONS Auroral pulses; quiverings Too faint to flush the pallid East; Nor yet the stir of earliest wings; But morn awakens, night has ceased. Dreams and the phantoms of the dark Troop earthwards; see, across the lawn A light breath lifts the leaves, and hark! The alleluias of the dawn. VIII BUD AND BLOSSOM O sweet and blind commotion of the sap When the first ray thrills in the folded flower! Virginal rapture tremulous; some great hap Befallen; a law declared; a quickening power. And henceforth life shall surely have a part In all that joy which makes the many One; The petals sever; the whole scented heart Lies naked for encounter with the sun. IX THE HAVEN It was not love, but o'er the array Of maiden faces clustering there My glance careered, which well might stay, For this was frank and that was fair. No haven for my sail that drove, No pharos; sunniest isles I passed; Then suddenly—it was not love— The haven, and an anchor cast. X MANNA I lived on manna day and night, So long! and still could live indeed; Nor murmured that such bread was light, My heaven-sent coriander-seed; I lived on manna night and day, No other food I craved or knew; Without my tent each morn it lay Pearl-pure, and sweet as honey-dew. XI LOVE'S NUDITY Naked this soul, for good or ill, Must stand before her eyes; So dear, so dread, his word and will Who builded Paradise. What if that gaze confirm my fear? What if those eyes approve? What if, so seen, she call me near To hide me in her love? XII MIRACLES That day you came and went faith grew In miracle; one while The dream swam up—was all not true?— Of wondering Theophile; Snows on the roofs, the ways, outspread; But lo! the radiant boy, And in heap'd arms great roses red Pluck'd from God's garth of joy; Pluck'd from God's garth of joy, and all The air was one warm stream Of summer. Can such things befall? Or is it but a dream? XIII LOVE'S LAW If it were possible to spare Your ears my dreaded truth, Fashions of friendship I might wear For pride perhaps or ruth. But this is law, not choice—to lay My whole soul in your hand; My part is only to obey, And yours to understand. My part to speak and there to end; Be you strict arbiter; Grant nought of all I need, my friend, If granting be to err. XIV LOVE'S ARTISTRY Search me and know me; understand Sense, spirit, passion, thought: Yet wherefore doubt? The craftsman's hand Should know the thing it wrought. Here joy has dealt with me, here pain; Here ran your hand, here stay'd: Was not a foolish carver fain Of his own ivory maid? XV CREDO QUIA IMPOSSIBILE O silence, now all golden, what a word, A star, into your shadowy waters fell! I dare believe a shining thing I heard, Because impossible. XVI HARVEST Wide harvest: all the plain Is wealth; on every tree Fulfilment; not in vain May's hope, June's prophecy. Joy is the vintager Who treads the wine-press; lo! A great, a golden year, And, stamp'd, the clusters flow. XVII A MOMENT Free forester of Dian's train, Yet swift arms girdled her about At one glad word: and how refrain? The dykes were down, the floods were out: Life was abroad; it was not I Who wrought a thing I knew not of; It was the whole world's ecstasy That woke and trembled into love. XVIII GRIEF IN JOY Grave joy; heaven's arch is deep And clear; still, still endures That grief although I cease to weep; Take it, for I am yours: And not less pure appears My heaven encircling earth, And tenderer for that rain of tears; Grave joy—a sacred birth. XIX GIVING AND TAKING Cross over from your side Of giver for my sake, Conceive what praises hide, Know once the love I take: So faith will rest assured, Nor praise and wonder ache, Joy may be well endured, Cross over for my sake. XX THE INTERPRETER Have I not look'd away from you? When to the compass of one face Did I contract the revenue Of beauty or the springs of grace? But if a deeper heaven lies bare Now; and a more enchanted sea Heaves; if the lit clouds are aware; If the first star with mystery Is laden; if some tremulous need Stirs in the midnight's brooding wings, Shall I not search your eyes to read The secret in the face of things? XXI DECEMBER Flowerless December, but this morn Of whirling rain and ruining cloud Behold! a flower of light is born By all heaven's gentleness o'erbow'd; Earth-born, yet scarce to earth akin; The chalice opening late; no rose— That is for youth; yet peer within! Like gold the lily-pollen glows. XXII ‘I WILL’ At last achievement past gainsay; ‘I will’ was spoken, and ‘I will;’ Southward we sped toward cape and bay, And talk'd of cloud and stream and hill. Pearl of great price, not bought indeed, Given to my breast, I own with awe, Since given where greatest was the need Also for you this thing was law. XXIII LOVE'S SACRAMENT Let not thy sacramental bread and wine, Lord Love, be found so sweet upon my lips That I forget the Presence, which is thine; Let not the lighted cloud the light eclipse. Nay, for a joy o'erripe turns sullenness Or wanes; heaven's gift is over at the prime; Thy will it is in thine own way to bless; Angels descend the ladder angels climb. XXIV AVE ATQUE VALE Ah Love! When all is gain'd, Graces no heart can tell, Then first I know the attain'd Is unattainable. The wave that climbs and falls Is still in radiant flight, Wind-driven, more drawn by calls Borne from the infinite. Horizons ever new, Cries that will ne'er be mute, Love's welcome an adieu, Love's conquest a pursuit. XXV THE RESTING PLACE Where her heart throbs (come life, come death) I lay my hand, nor can rehearse The thoughts, but know that love and faith Are pillars of the universe. XXVI IMPERSONAL Awe fell on me: we two shall be no more Estrays, but still some part, whate'er ensue, Of the vast sea that heaves without a shore, Life limitless, love infinite—we two; A sparkle in the smile of God's glad deep, A fruit that falls not from the unfading tree, A flash of colour in the bow where leap The sunlit torrents of eternity. XXVII BABBLEMENT Once more my idle word Craves to possess your ear, All heard before, all heard Only once more to hear. This endless babbling stream Far in the hills arose, Through gloom it ran and gleam, The chaliced rock o'erflows; And should a slumbrous peace Fall on your lids, the rill Scarce heeds, nor yet will cease Because inaudible. XXVIII GRATITUDE Now silence! weighing down a steep descent I sink to ultimate peace in final good; Below life's joyance lies this pure content, Where all I am is merely gratitude. XXIX EMBAYED Where bliss is calm as deep Here let my shallop rest; Heaven bends above us; sleep Invades her sacred breast: A mirror'd heaven below; O'erhead—love's infinite; Here would I rest, nor know The rapids of delight. XXX THE BOWMAN No stronghold brave she gained; in one so poor No treasure-house; and yet I make my claim— Ay, proud to be the crenell'd aperture Through which the unerring Bowman took his aim. And if his arrow struck the noblest heart, How should I be remorseful? By his grace Toward his high stand she glanced with sudden start, And through the loophole dusk beheld His face. XXXI GIFT ON GIFT Love's kingdom first, a spirit divine, I sought and all his righteousness; These things are added and are mine; He who would bless would doubly bless. Love's kingdom which long since I sought I have not left, I cannot leave; But in his hand the Master brought To Eden's bower the gracious Eve. XXXII THE CHAPEL The starry chapel, where I bow My head in thanks or lift in praise, Has altars four; at each a vow I make, at each a hymn I raise. Her brain: whose poignant quivering flame Leaps, laughs and lightens from the pyre; Dry logs I gathered—such my claim— And laid in order: hers the fire. Her soul: not as the Scribes it spoke, Sundering things real from things that seem; I felt the austere control; I woke, And on the altar left a dream. Her breast, Love's shrine: for very awe So long, so long, I stood apart; Then bow'd to dread benignant law, And on the coals I cast a heart. An altar last, whose incensed air Quickens the breath like wildrose wine Inhaled when all the land is fair, And girdling heaven shows earth divine. XXXIII EXCHANGES Receive my gift, Belovéd, such a dower As heaven rejects not, and the breathing soil Offers as purest incense—your own power In blissful swift recoil. All April gleams; breeze, sunshine, shower renew The earth, and skyward floats a vernal drift; The lit clouds sunder; see, a tenderer blue Owns the reverting gift. XXXIV SURPRISES The presage tells of rest, deep rest; Joy enters wing'd for flight; The clouds that pause around the West Are thrill'd and fill'd with light. The presage tells of joy: such need, Such hope, is straight withdrawn; Rest, lucid rest, has Love decreed, The hush of earliest dawn. XXXV CHARITY AND KNOWLEDGE Faith, Hope and Charity—these three, The greatest Charity, 'tis writ; But ‘Trinity in Unity’ The word were had I utter'd it. For what is Hope but Love that bends Forth in the race with quickening breath? And there are hours when Love ascends To lose and find itself in Faith. Knowledge, 'tis written, has her place Lower than Love; and yet I own At times this seems Love's loveliest grace— Merely to know and to be known. XXXVI THE POTTER'S WHEEL You took this fictile clay—a heart— Shaped it to what you chose to make; Applaud a little your own art, Nay, cherish for the artist's sake. To pressure light and strict it grew, Curved as the potter's hand gave law; Was it a chalice, wine or dew Glimmering to hold, that you foresaw? Nor think your artistry at end; Still whirls the wheel—O joy and fear!— Mar for a moment, still to mend, Fashion it unto honour, Dear. XXXVII THE HOLY OF HOLIES My brave, marauding honey-bee, Down the deep flower-neck you have push'd Your way to some dear mystery Of gladness, and your hum is hush'd. Even in a blossom's heart there lies An inmost chamber of the heart, Mystery beyond all mysteries, Where the last veil is drawn apart. Found you a sun-warm'd palace there, A white tent where you lie enfurl'd, A cell, a temple, a chaste lair That holds the sweetness of the world? O my wise honey-bee! such joy Lives not, you know, with buzz or bruit; Be happy in your hush'd employ; I pause, I ponder, and am mute. XXXVIII GOLD HAIR That glory mass'd, your girlhood's vaunt, The gold great hair by me unseen, Was it the aureole of a saint? Was it the rigol of a queen? Yet here is wealth enough to bribe A world of hearts; take but this one Bright ingot sever'd from its tribe, This wheat-sheaf in the August sun. XXXIX THE PITCHER With what marmoreal grace the maid Bore her brimm'd pitcher from the well, One white arm curved, a hip that sway'd, A foot that firmly fell. The vessel on my shoulder set Fluctuates with full felicity; Add strength to bear my gladness, let My burden steady me. XL TURF Thank God for simple, honest, close-knit turf, Sound footing for plain feet; nor moss, nor mire; No silvery quicksand, no hot sulphurous scurf Flung from a turmoil'd fire. So far your hand has led me: what is worth A question now of all the heavens conceal? Here shall we lie, and better love the Earth, And let the planets reel. XLI FONS SIGNATUS Still the clear spirit's dignity; To me love's inmost shrine reveal'd; Yet with no squander'd sweetness she Gives largess from the fountain seal'd. Never the blossom overblown, And therefore a perpetual bride, For whom the spirit's loosen'd zone Has worth, nor will be laid aside. XLII THE PLUMMET I let my plummet sink and sink Into this sea of blessing; when, Or where should it touch shoal? I think Love lies beyond our furthest ken. Above, the sun-smit waves career; They have their voices wild and free; Below them, where no eye can peer, Love's great glad taciturnity. XLIII COMMUNITY Of all her joys the Earth has need; The kindly Mother finds her part In plumping nut, and feathering seed, And heart that ripens upon heart. Her gifts to her own breast return— Pride of the marshall'd spears of grain, Passion of clouds that flush and burn, And love's pulsating old refrain. With all her infants' glee is stirred The spirit within her, grave and sweet, The leap of lamb, the cry of bird, And hands that touch and lips that meet. And it may be that half her store Of life and warmth is treasured up From hearts like ours, her wine that bore, And danced her dance, and crown'd her cup. O blind it were to deem that we Are in our proper bliss inisled! The old Mother own'd community Who bended over us and smiled. XLIV INDULGENCES Ah, why has Love no general store Wherein their merits in excess Of duty saints like you could pour, And folk like me their happiness? Through us the sun would mount, and want Be lighten'd; each might have his share; Love's Vicar could indulgence grant Plenary or particular. XLV LOVE TOKENS Two gifts: mere sparkling granite this; Why given that day my heart inquires; I think because in earth's abyss It felt the glow of central fires. And now the earliest daffodils, Sun-lovers, comrades of the breeze, Through which earth's sudden rapture thrills, And spring's awaken'd ecstasies. XLVI BRITOMART Smile if you will at my dear need, O bright-hair'd daughter of the North! Yes, you are stronger; but we read Out of the strong came sweetness forth. With me life's proper flame aspires Through needs; each day new call I make For bread, for wine, man's heart desires; But Dian strength would give, not take. Yet who was she that lay and toss'd, O'ercome with mighty throes of heart, Deep-struck, her virgin freedom lost? —Not Amoret, it was Britomart. XLVII LOVE'S CHORD Stand off from me; be still your own; Love's perfect chord maintains the sense Through harmony, not unison, Of finest difference. See not as I see; set your thought Against my thought; call up your will To grapple mine; gay bouts we fought, Let us be wrestlers still. Then, if we cannot choose but mate And mingle wholly, it will be The doom of law, a starry fate, And glad necessity. XLVIII HOURS AND MOMENTS Yes, if need were we two could dare To part, and still the days were bright, Though less than these swift days that wear Their nimbus of glad morn, glad night. Good hours would chime upon the clock; But ah, the moments! which could be The wing'd keybearer that unlocks The gates of immortality? XLIX OLD LETTERS Your letters flinging their good seed— Wit, counsel, wisdom, thought— Words that could shape my dream, my deed, I miss them, do I not? Yes, but how words dissect, divide Our truths; their swiftest play Hastens too slowly, strikes too wide, Falters or falls away. And now our meanings, whole and sole, From sense to spirit outleap; Truth now with joy is integral, Deep answers unto deep. So when speech comes to claim its share, We feel, all words beneath, Tremblings of heart oracular, Accords of life and death. L THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE Framed in old verse Italian See Love in triumph charioted, His captives follow maid and man With corded wrist and bended head: Glad children rather should be here, Young heirs who never felt the rod, Clad in the love that casts out fear, And freedom of the sons of God. LI THE BOOK OF HOURS Blown sea-cliff, dreaming pasturage, The moor, broad cornland flaunting flowers, Each place we moved in is a page Of my illumined Book of Hours. Bird, bloom and bee are in the marge, How fresh the tinctures, free the grace! But in the midst and limn'd at large The aureoled wonder of her face. LII THE COUCH Sure resting-place above the shock Of waters, safe from clambering waves, Here be your couch, the living rock Lull'd by the gulphing of the caves. I shall be human still, and feast My sense, your spy for brave things done: Hug nature you, a drowsed sea-beast, Slow-breathing, saturate with the sun. LIII SEA-ANEMONES Look! the waves' wash has reach'd this drain'd alcove: Its crimson blooms retracted know at hand The tidal flow; peer now! they thrill, they move, Petals and anthers waver and expand. ‘Praised, praised be God for thee,’ my heart has cried, ‘My little brother, the anemone! My spirit has also heard a jubilant tide, And known the blissful whelming of the sea.’ LIV BURNET ROSES On sand-dunes of this western sea Here, mid the bent grass, roses shine, Clear-carven, chaliced ivory, Brimm'd with the summer's perfumed wine. Never those orbed splendours fed From garden-mould, June's tended train, Crimson or gold, soft-bosoméd, Darted such transport to the brain. How well with sweetness strength agrees! The liberal air, the spacious light, The sounding waves, have fashioned these; Take them; such things are yours by right. LV SPRING IN AUTUMN We are alone with sea and sun; Give the child's instinct in you play, And where the laughing ripples run Step barefoot touch'd by wind and spray; And let me smile; the autumn day Mimics the springtime; seasons meet One moment; let my fancies stray With the glad ripples round your feet. LVI THE PILGRIM The sunset trance is in her eyes; I know the spirit's homeless flight; Estranged from earth, a pilgrim hies To seek the founts of light. Love frames no cage, love weaves no net; I would not whisper a recall, Nor choose to capture what is yet Remote and virginal. LVII SUNRISE Lo! on yon eastern marge the sun: The waves a miracle confess, And awed, illumined tremors run Through the sea-spaces measureless. I knew that mystery of the spear, The shaft of flame, the poignant ray; But knew not if 'twere bliss or fear Such seizure by the arisen day. LVIII THE LOST DIAN And if I lose your image, Dear, One moment in the joy of you, Think, the moon-marvel in the mere A moment since was mirror'd true: There lay the Dian, till at once Thrill'd all the waters, and, behold! The disk is scatter'd, and there runs A rippled race of quivering gold. LIX SECRETS Noontide and summer; not a breeze Abroad, and all the landscape shines; Yet hush! what murmur'd mysteries! There sounds a going in the pines. Our spirits, rooted firm in earth, Reach heavenward; not a branch astir; Yet secrets as of death and birth Are breath'd, nor crave interpreter. LX CLOUDS Hourlong today I watch'd across the plain The speechless intercourse of cloud and hill, Approaches, hushed enfoldings, and again Slow disengagements, sunderings soft and still. Anon in ancient hollows, where the stream Tumbles, or where the pinewood climbs the steep, The fleecy vapours nestled as in dream, Separate, yet side by side like folded sheep. Last, height and heaven were bare; no pearly flake But was a truant of the winnowing wind: What gift of strength did those pale wanderers take? What gift of sweetness did they leave behind? LXI SONG AND SUNSET Tumultuous splendours in the West, A brazier fuming chrysoprase, Southward translucent amethyst Veils mountain-capes and mountain-bays. Extravagance of pomp! yet still, As yester-evening grey, I hear The self-same robin's frugal bill Pipe the same carol thin and clear. LXII NATURE'S NEED We are two foam-flakes on a stream, Two thistle-downs upon the air; Yet joy is therefore not a dream; Bear us, glad Power, we know not where! The mighty Mother has a need Through us to ease her blissful ache; Blow, breeze, and drive the lucky seed, Flow, stream, and dance the water-flake. LXIII WAKING Waking is wonder; summer airs Ripple the wheat-field, where a crew Of wing'd sweet thieves in flights, in pairs, Their knavish craft pursue. They dip, lurk, eddy, swing and sway Upon the stalk—glad, wrangling throats; While silent to the wind-fleck'd bay Glide home the pilchard-boats. Waking is infant joy new born; And how should wonder e'er be dead For me, who lean toward the morn Across so dear a head? LXIV THE VILLAGE WELL Beneath the beech-tree's dome of shade, Her pitcher on the coping-stone, There at the well the village-maid Sits, muses, leans and dreams alone. She gazes down where glimmering lies The girdled fount, discovering there Those mirror'd stars which are her eyes, That wavering gold which is her hair. Nor know I whether memories haunt These waters, or some hidden fire Would be allay'd, some nameless want, The trouble of some dim desire. Lean, lean, Beloved, you alone, Here where my happiness, a well, Trembles, here where a face has shone Secluded and adorable. Gaze yet again where glimmering lies The water of this fount of grace, And watch intent! What if there rise Wavering to sight the Naiad's face! LXV BLOSSOMS Bring, bring a rose to sate the eye, Bring orchids for my sake, Wing'd like some Orient butterfly, And spotted like the snake. But if I pluck a flower for you, Let be the imperial rose, Let be the blooms of vapoury mew Hot garden-walls inclose. Gorse from a wild hill's golden crown, For plough or spade too poor; A hare-bell from the windy down Heath from the purple moor; It must have dared to meet the gale, It must have loved the skies, Have seen great sunset glories fail, And watch'd the dawn uprise. LXVI A FAREWELL The silver chime! and we must part; Our lark shall be no nightingale: I go; one moment heart on heart, Enough for all the day's avail. So hidden in the depth of day In toil, in turmoil, that must be, This moment will fling forth a ray On time from white eternity. LXVII NEW HORIZONS If love were but a curious maze With halt at midmost, who would choose Swift triumph? Better Dear delays, And blind, bewildering avenues. The frankness of the sea, the sky, Become you, you who grant the whole Fearless, and still the marges fly, And deeper heavens allure the soul. LXVIII PAST AND PRESENT Those rare unearthly years of ours Moved on no fairer heavenlier range Than these of full cooperant powers, Yet make earth's harvest-sunshine strange. Strange that the spirit of a star Should stoop and enter at my door, Still fire and dew as when afar, Yet human to the ripe heart's core. And in my soul a fount that gush'd, Lucid with wandering mountain-gleams, In waterbreaks leap'd valeward, flush'd With all its tributary streams. LXIX POVERTY AND PLENTY I can remember when a child I gave my fortune all away, Two halfpennies, for my heart was wild To bless that bedesman faint and grey. And still I see his mute appeal, The craving in his eyes I see, Still hear his blessing and can feel My leap of infant ecstasy. Therefore I urge not—‘Tell me true, Say, are you happy?’ nor take thought Because, being wholly given to you, I never yet could give you aught. That you were rich, that I was poor, And beggary all the trade I had, 'Tis this that makes my soul secure— You gave and cannot but be glad. LXX WISE FOOLISHNESS I posed you with Athene's spear, A virgin warrior, fancy-free; How could I then divine that dear And deep irrationality? Fools both: you spendthrift in desire So poor a man as me to bless, And I who at my altar-fire Sang hyms to Wisdom's patroness. Ah! and how swift time plies the wing; Here sit we Doctors in Love's school; So learned we know the wisest thing On earth is to have play'd the fool. O wise dear foolishness! Such lore We grey-hair'd sages try to preach To youngsters now, Nay, let's give o'er, Our rede to them is foreign speech. LXXI CHILDHOOD Her earliest love (down jealous rage!) Was but the King of Scotland's son, Crusading Kenneth; eight her age, My sweet, small, amorous simpleton. Vanished the northern wizardry; Next Harold slain in desperate fight, Found by the Swan-neck (that was she;) The third, I think, Aslauga's knight. Whereon names follow quick and thick, But somewhat fretted by the moth, Save one all gold—Theodoric! Tut, child, to choose an Ostrogoth! But when the lists were set one day, Who like a thunderbolt bore down All champions, bore the prize away? Dear, a poor clerk in scholar's gown. LXXII THE RIVAL Your rival—yes, and not an hour Out of my sight; be jealous now! The same grave face of tender power, The same pure lips and brooding brow. The hair mere sunshine wefted fine; The eyes that look'd through life and death; The spirit alive in every line, Which grew to be my pulse, my breath. Room in my heart must be for two, Nor know I which I should prefer, Your rival who long since was you, Or you proved all I dreamed of her. LXXIII SIXTEEN YEARS Echoes of shawms and trumpets, Dear, Vibrate; this day you came to me; Think! now begins our sixteenth year; Praise, praise, and proud humility. Think of a man assurance saves, Sustains yet whelms in life and limb; O strong salvation, all thy waves And billows have gone over him! LXXIV TRUTHS AND TRUTH We chased ideas years ago, Truths seem'd our quarry day by day; Has all our fire now smoulder'd low, The hunter's passion for his prey? Or are we victors after strife? Merchants retired from rich employ? Does truth put on the limbs of Life, And wear the fervid face of Joy? LXXV MADONNA Always before me as we climb'd the height, Always than mine a wider, steadier view, Always at call a hand's grasp firm, though light, Till where she had stood I now was standing too. Fain, fain to serve am I; yet be my part To need a refuge, claim protectiveness, So serving best the great Madonna-heart; My gift to know all blessing, hers to bless. LXXVI JUSTICE Your cry was ever ‘Justice!’ Did I deem Justice a stern-brow'd goddess, sword in hand? Stern-brow'd in truth, and in her eyes a gleam Indignant, on her lips a dread command. Yet you have shown her with a tenderer brow, Sowing fair deeds, giver of cheer, of coins, Strict, wise, benignant; and I name her now ‘Love with the lighted lamp and girded loins.’ LXXVII LIBERALITY The sun is not less free to all In largess, though he yield Some lovelier light angelical To yonder hillside field. The stream has mirth for all the wild And all the wood, though here —Listen!—its laughter of a child Ring blithest and most clear. Gladden the region; give away, To each that claims, a part; I grasp no miser's gold who lay This hand upon your heart. LXXVIII THE WAVE Once more—how vain, how vain!— The wave breaks up the shore, Pale praise, unfruitful thanks again, And hopeless speech once more. High as the wave may run It can but leave behind One foam-bell glittering in the sun, And quivering to the wind. LXXIX SPEECH A CLOUD If all my words are but a cloud, Half sun-suffused, half darkening you, And winnowing song, or low or loud, Scant help to let the radiance through. Fling down some wide aerial shaft Of sunbeams, an illumined stair, That, past the shadowings of my craft, Watchers may yet divine you there; A stair from heaven to earth whereon White Presences may come and go Envoys, who at Love's bidding run, To breathe your name to men below. LXXX THE SOURCE Live water insuppressible, Upwelling new and still the same, Slender but lucid—who can tell From what strong ribs of earth it came? Look how the grains of yellow sand Are toss'd! Now stoop; with finger-tip Touch, or in hollow of your hand Bear one light ripple to your lip. So streams have sprung that broaden free Past fane deep-fronted, bulwark brave; This will not bear an argosy; Enough! Egeria scoop'd the wave. LXXXI THE VIOLIN No lucky Stradivarius this! Poor fiddle, lacking craftsman's name; Yet poised, and to the bow submiss, Some touch of music's rapture came. Is it because your hand can win From every yearning thing its best? Is it because, glad violin, It lean'd and trembled toward your breast? LXXXII SEA-MEWS' CRIES If we were nested with a brood, Safe in the fork twixt bough and bough, Heaven's silence or earth's quietude Long warblings might allow. But sea-bird from the crag that flies Across the voiceful plain, or flits From ridge to ridge that climbs and cries, Such shrill swift call befits. LXXXIII THE NORTH WIND A wanderer in the mist was I, Faltering 'mid pallid wreaths adrift, With naught to hope, resist, descry, And not a dream the cloud could lift. You were the North wind, not for ease Issuing, but strength to slay despair; I lean'd forth, drank the quickening breeze, Look'd—and behold, the heaven was bare! And whether luck it was, or grace, When thus I gazed around, abroad, Blind feet had borne me to a place That seem'd the very mount of God. LXXXIV THE RAPIDS Where most the rapids swirl'd I lay Motionless in our frail canoe; The Indian guide whose toil seem'd play, Lithe oarsman at the prow, were you. Yet what a need of practised eye, Of poise or turn of wrist what need, To shoot secure through jeopardy With such a breathless, quivering speed! And ever while the oar you plied I knew no thought of life or death, Nor felt the snakelike waters glide, But lived in some deep heaven of faith. LXXXV THE CHALLENGE Brain challenged brain to onset fierce, Youth was our cartel-bearer gay, And desperate was the quart-and-tierce, But all my pride was in your play. Honest rencounters, brain with brain; And yet with springing heart I viewed The dexterous arm that thrust amain, And shifting grace of attitude. Times alter; calm the seasons move; Yet come, one bout! I throw my gage, And dare you, who can never prove That youth was half so blest as age. LXXXVI KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH I circled wide, the sea-mew's way, Sway'd as in blissful idleness, Loll'd on the wave yet found my prey And gather'd knowledge none the less. Pillar'd on air you tower'd, a thing Intense in rest, that knew nor dip Nor dart, but hung on vibrant wing; —You fell, and truth was in your grip. LXXXVII EXCHANGE OF SEX In some strange world, ere stars were old, Or here ere ocean whelm'd a land, You were a bearded sea-king bold, I, a white maiden on the strand. Strong arms compell'd her to your bark, Light borne for all your ring-wrought gear; You swept the waves from dawn to dark, While pride was trembling through her fear. She half remembers in a dream Grey towers of her sea-eagle's nest; Sunshine and storm, the gloom, the gleam, Warmth, might, male gladness on her breast. You had your will, and very life Of yours was then her cherish'd store; Can you recall when I was wife, And thoughts of yours grew babes I bore? So now if sweet authority Touches, though in a different sex, Your love, and I approve it, why Should instincts from the prime perplex? LXXXVIII THE STONE-BREAKER On life's roadside I sit and break Poor learning's stones for pay; Nor is the trade too bad, I make My half-a-crown a day. My good hour comes; 'tis past the noon, And sure as sure can be With kerchief'd head and kilted gown The mistress steps toward me; Not slim perhaps as once she was, Yet still some girlish grace, Not with light footing of the lass But just as brave a face; She bears the can, she bears the mug, The bulging handkerchief; Beneath the hedge is shelter snug, O hour of my relief! And sure such bread is angels' food, Such cheese heaven's honey-dew; Kind are the eyes as when I wooed, The heart as stout and true. So when she goes my hammer plies Livelier on learning's stones, Till home I trudge to meet her eyes, Maybe with aching bones. LXXXIX THE NEW CIRCE Mistress of innocent spells, your brain, A kindlier Circe, rules my rout Of thoughts and fancies. What a train Gather their Queen about! Smile at their awkward gambolling With queenly-humorous, wise regard; And let them fling and spring and cling, Your rabble, ounce and pard. Praise their quaint fawnings if you can, Or pierce at once through the disguise, Their thwarted gestures tell of man, And human are their eyes. XC DISCIPLINE Your strength at first controll'd the man Too many an aim diverts, dilates; He knew constraint and swiftlier ran As through the Danube's Iron Gates. So 'twas in youth; your strength no less Confirms me now, but you assuage The strong control; your gentleness Has made me great in this my age. XCI EVENTIDE ‘Old friends,’ so have they named us, ‘now grown one, ‘And twilight peace for cares will make amends, ‘Nothing so natural underneath the sun As such soft fading radiance for old friends.’ But we have wing'd our level western flight Beyond the glimmering marge, the cloud-confine, To heavens where peace is rapture of the light, And all the shoreless sea is hyaline. XCII TRANSITION Low drops the sun, but on these sands The waves still laugh and clap their hands, By awe untouch'd or fear; Life is for them an ecstasy, Nor child nor lamb has keener cry Of joy, though night be near. But turn! yon mountains take the light Aware of transits infinite, Clear-edged, intense, severe, Back'd by pure spaces measureless; In fortitude, submissiveness, Some word of God they hear. XCIII GLOAMING They come like shadows, so depart; Theirs is the morn; the eventide Is mine; life may have worn my heart; They pass, and you abide. They troop, each man his several way, Expectant; I expect the night; But while you sit by me and stay At even time shall be light. XCIV IN THE STORM The storm is on us! How the flood Is whipp'd, the woodlands roar! Cloud topples westward over cloud, We'll see the sun no more. Because we had our brave repast, Great light, clear airs, nor dearth Of life or love, we stem the blast And keep our faith in earth. XCV BETHESDA One writes ‘Your words had power to sain And soothe a grief’; but I, no fool, Know whence this virtue mastering pain, The secret of Bethesda's pool. For common needs the waters lay Sufficient, nor would I contemn; Then dawn'd a high miraculous day; An angel came and troubled them. XCVI WINNINGS That gambler, he who raked the gold, Each shadow'd eye a glittering spark, Rose calm, push'd back the curtain-fold, And took his way into the dark. My gold is gift of grace, not luck, But if a call should sound from far, Back the dark curtain I could pluck, And front—perchance the morning-star. XCVII LOVE AND DEATH If at the summons we, in sudden flight With equal beat and poise of wing, beneath Love's arm of benediction flash'd from light, To lose ourselves on the dark breast of Death; Such flight were blissful close. The shadow'd face Might wear a smile maternal, and, arrived At that dim goal, a murmuring word of grace Might thrill the vacant air—‘These two have lived.’ XCVIII THE BLESSED ONES Because I am in love with life, Because I breathe a finer air Above the din and dust of strife, The dead have grown more fair. Their eyes send forth a sunset beam, A tenderer ray on mine uplift; Their voices sound a twilight stream, This also is your gift. XCIX INTIMATE SORROW Here leave me: something is your own By old prerogatives of blood; Enter the shadow and alone, I ask not closer neighbourhood. Mine too the grief; but Memory fills A deeper chalice with your tears; Shootings there are and sudden thrills From all the half-forgotten years. Pass through the portal dark and low, Single; without I keep my stand; Yet take from me, before you go, The touch of no indifferent hand. C LACHRYMATORIES These lachrymatories we behold Were ravish'd from some sepulchre; Tears fell and heads were bow'd of old; They turn'd and Life was lawgiver. Praise, praise and thanks, by day, by night Be yours, not chiefly that you laid Those kind assuaging hands and light With all strong comfort on my head; But that within Life's radiant shrine, Where stands the glowing altar, where The flame that leaps is fed with wine, My vase of tears you bade me bear. CI LOVE'S LORD When weight of all the garner'd years Bows me, and praise must find relief In harvest-song, and smiles and tears Twist in the band that binds my sheaf; Thou known Unknown, dark, radiant sea In whom we live, in whom we move, My spirit must lose itself in Thee, Crying a name—Life, Light, or Love. [Think not the bird, from rung to rung] Think not the bird, from rung to rung That climbs his high aerial stair, Tells all his joy; the things unsung Of his blue heaven are song's despair. Think not the spray that gleams and flies From the toss'd crest is all the wave; And feel my dear deep silences Through loves that laud, through calls that crave.</field>
