      <field name="fulltext">Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations TO OUR GREAT CONTEMPORARY WRITER OF PATRIOTIC POETRY, ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE [JUBILEE GREETING TO THE MEN OF GREATER BRITAIN] PART I. I In this great year—this year of her Who loved you in your infant days, the Queen— Who when the timid sophister Was fain to narrow the divine demesne Of Freedom, bade it still expand— Loved you, in all her loveless realm alone— Ye come to her whose gentle hand Ay drew you to the Motherland, Drew you till Ocean's mighty waist was spanned By Britain's zone. II Beyond the stars your sires rejoice Who hear to-day this iron clang and rattle, And they recall the Channel's voice Which in old fights lent music to the battle, For breath of Death can never smother For them the voice when this bright bosom heaves With pride of Her she guards—the Mother For whom our Drake with many a brother Won from the world the robe above all other The proud sea weaves. III Therefore this sight is yours and ours Whose fathers see it, wheresoe'er they dwell: Not even the breath of Eden flowers Can win them from the Channel's salt sweet smell; And yonder skyey wings that hover Kindling each steel-clad titan till he glows— Wings of Old England's Angel-lover— Your fathers see them shine above her— They see our Angel of the Channel cover Spithead with rose. IV With Kings that Angel learnt to fight: Their hireling axes shivered in their helves: His foe is now the people's spite When bloody-minded nations kill themselves; But still, round England's sacred crags, His billowy squadrons roll round her ye love, Moving with glory of varying flags With purple pennon's golden jags, Mirrored from every cloud that flies or drags Or streams above. V When foemen threat He smiles, He smiles! Yea, England's guardian angel stirs His wings— Then out from furthest Scilly Isles, Right on by Deal a glittering laughter springs, As when of old His billowy host Cried out “Ha! ha! they come, the ships of Spain!”— As when that day around the coast The news of Trafalgar was tossed Ere yet His billows knew what England lost— What man lay slain. VI The eyes of heroes light the Past: The men who builded Time's heroic years, Who quelled the world 'neath sail and mast, Can see each armoured ship beyond the spheres— Can see yon flag of curling smoke From funnels of our Angel's Admiral Steam— They talk of how the Armada broke Against Britannia's shield of oak Whilst there on wheels of storm with foam-flecked yoke He drove his team. VII Your fathers grew to demi-gods Breathing his breath, the same ye breathe to-day; And Drake, when fronting grievous odds Drew strength from Channel wind and Channel spray; And, through that fateful August night When Grenville read his name on flags of Death, He saw, by love's high second-sight, Far off beyond the monstrous fight, The wings of England's Angel hovering bright And felt His breath. VIII As if His guardian coursers heard Prophetic strains from mystic harps of Ocean, His mighty heart to-day is stirred, Hearing your voice, to some sublime emotion Which makes His pinions glow, and makes The Channel heave as if the waters knew; Brothers, the hand of Evening shakes A rosier haze through rosier flakes, Because your Angel of the Channel wakes To welcome you. IX And see!—around that cloud-pavilion, Gleaming above the sun's bright ocean-bed, Where veils of evening grow vermilion, Ancestral pictures, yours and ours, are spread! Those wings of His that glitter golden Above the crests of Britain's iron steeds,— Those wings of His could once embolden— In mighty days beloved and olden— Your god-like sires by whom they were beholden To god-like deeds. X When, strong as Death and swift as Death, He let the Spanish galleons in—and moved— Yea moved to smite with angry breath, Till not a sail defiled the sea he loved— That breath which nerved for gun and pike Each English arm till in each English hand All weapons, splinter, marlin spike Or sprit or sword, were strong to strike Such strokes no Spaniard ever saw the like By sea or land. XI They fought with England long ago; They strove with her whose gate the billows keep; On Channel chalk they sleep below— In caverns of the great North Sea they sleep. “Thus soldier, priest, and mariner,” He said,—our guardian angel said,—“shall perish; My deeps have still a sepulchre For all whom envy or hate shall stir To strike across them—strike at England, her The billows cherish.” PART II. “‘British’ always has included all nationalities within the mother-islands of the British Empire.” George Baden-Powell, Times, June 16, 1897. I Earth's memory holds a living vision Of all the sights she saw since time began; These shores record her slow transition From age to age while yet she yearned for man; But when the Future makes a sign— When Nature's mystic eyes prognosticate— 'Tis in the sunset halls that shine Builded of cloud and air and brine: Brothers, that untried fleet but makes me pine To read her fate. II Through this great age, with heights above All other heights of England's Day save one— Through this long reign of her we love Hath England basked in Fortune's summer sun; But not then, e'en then, when heedless Time Saw Stratford's truant boy read Avon's word, Did England's path seem so sublime As now, when out from every clime Her children flock to hear the Channel-chime Their fathers heard. III Fools who believed themselves her friends, And foes less dire than friends because of wrath, Would turn her from her noble ends; But Nature's mystic finger traced her path: Strife hath been hers, not oft with peers, Her hand's far shadow quelled the savage foe, Yet sometimes falling on mine ears, Voices have vexed my soul with fears: What sorrows in the womb of future years Shall England know? IV How shall she stand when round the world Envy shall hiss—Hell's Cobra-de-Capello— With flicker of tongue o'er folds half curled Dull eyes of malice set in dingy yellow, Baring her fangs, spreading her hood, To strike our England, her whose stainless brand— Whetted to slaughter Slaughter's brood— Uneager even for foeman's blood— Strikes ever home but ever strikes for good,— How shall she stand? V Still, this sweet music of your voices, Speaking from over-sea our Nelson's tongue, Comes with a thought that now rejoices My sinking heart, a thought that makes it young, And She seems young for whom was wrought What Drake hath done and Nelson, She Whose blood of heroes dead hath bought Empires for you—a glorious thought Of England's mighty future that hath brought New joy to me. VI If but the thews of Englishmen In Drake's great day were strong for every foe, Shall England find her conqueror when Not English thews alone deal England's blow, When Scotland, that twin-sister, who, Alone among the nations, met her might With eyes unblenched, who ne'er withdrew From battle till her heather's blue Shone red with southron blood of men she slew, Strengthens the fight? VII When Ireland, once so fiercely brave Gainst England, standing now with many a scar From many a fight on field and wave— From Waterloo and Nile and Trafalgar— Brings memories of the men who died To keep two deathless Isles of Freedom free; When sons of three Great sisters ride In those proud ships with equal pride Ready for all the world and, side by side Share Sovereignty. VIII This makes the billows leap along With finer gallop—leap because they know How love hath made the sisters strong To meet the foe, though all the world be foe— Because they hear another sound, A girdle of music round the orb of waters— Voices from those who, standing round All shores where ocean waves rebound— Stand there with British feet on British ground Britannia's Daughters— IX Voices of those whose bond of love, Binding them each to each o'er every sea, Is love of Her whose pulses move To peans of an Empire's Jubilee; Voices that come from distant lands— From elfin halls where gem-crowned Africa Opens at last her mystic hands, And from that eldest born who stands Between the world's two sister-ocean strands, Great Canada; X And from those sisters of the South, Betrothed to stars of deeper soul than ours, Whose young lips feel the mother's mouth, Who still remember scent of English flowers: New Zealand shedding, far away, Fragrance of Albion o'er the vast expanse; Australias, round whose coral way Pacific billows write in spray A word in sunbeams on the gleaming day— Faith's word, “Advance.” XI All say, “Beloved Angel, Thou Whose flag above Thy Channel ne'er is furled Thine England's wider moat is now Ocean, who lisps her name around the world; In Northern sun—in Southern sun, True daughters, yea to very death, are we Of her whose morn hath but begun— Whose robe, our hero-fathers won— That robe the great uniting Sea hath spun— Her Subject Sea.” FOUR SONNETS TO THOSE WHO CARRY THE TONGUE OF Shakspeare round the world. ADVANCE, AUSTRALIA! THE PASSAGE TO ENGLAND Yon albatross, whose stirless pinions follow The ship through smile and frown of wind and weather, Outsails, without the labour of a feather, Each frigate-bird and gull and ocean-swallow. Yes, while the sunny billows wake and wallow, Now yellow as gold—now purple as flowering heather— Now glassing all the hues of morn together— In play rides he o'er steaming crest and hollow! Australia—thou whose flight shall still advance On wings that never beat, yet never stay— That win (like thine own bird's) the race in play— Desert not thou, whatever winds of chance May fret the changing waves of Time's expanse, The ship that led thee on thy morning way! ENGLAND STANDS ALONE “England stands alone: without an ally.” A German Newspaper. “She stands alone: ally nor friend has she,” Saith Europe of our England—her who bore Drake, Blake, and Nelson—Warrior-Queen who wore Light's conquering glaive that strikes the conquered free. Alone!—From Canada comes o'er the sea, And from that English coast with coral shore, The old-world cry Europe hath heard of yore From Dover cliffs: “Ready, aye ready we!” “Europe,” saith England, “hath forgot my boys!— Forgot how tall, in yonder golden zone 'Neath Austral skies, my youngest born have grown (Bearers of bayonets now and swords for toys)— Forgot 'mid boltless thunder—harmless noise— The sons with whom old England ‘stands alone’!” THE BREATH OF AVON TO ENGLISH-SPEAKING PILGRIMS ON SHAKSPEARE'S BIRTHDAY I Whate'er of woe the Dark may hide in womb For England, mother of kings of battle and song— Rapine, or racial hate's mysterious wrong, Blizzard of Chance, or fiery dart of Doom— Let breath of Avon, rich of meadow-bloom, Bind her to that great daughter sever'd long— To near and far-off children young and strong— With fetters woven of Avon's flower perfume. Welcome, ye English-speaking pilgrims, ye Whose hands around the world are join'd by him, Who make his speech the language of the sea, Till winds of Ocean waft from rim to rim The Breath of Avon: let this great day be A Feast of Race no power shall ever dim. II From where the steeds of Earth's twin oceans toss Their manes along Columbia's chariot-way; From where Australia's long blue billows play; From where the morn, quenching the Southern Cross, Startling the frigate-bird and albatross Asleep in air, breaks over Table Bay— Come hither, pilgrims, where these rushes sway 'Tween grassy banks of Avon soft as moss! For, if ye found the breath of Ocean sweet, Sweeter is Avon's earthy, flowery smell, Distill'd from roots that feel the coming spell Of May, who bids all flowers that lov'd him meet In meadows that, remembering Shakspeare's feet, Hold still a dream of music where they fell.</field>
