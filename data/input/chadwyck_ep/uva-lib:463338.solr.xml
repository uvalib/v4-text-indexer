Goe ye curssed sorte into the euerlastyng fyre that was prepared for the Deuill and his Angelles Math. xxv. To the ryght worshypful Lady Dame Elizabeth Fane, wyfe to the ryght worshypfull Syr Rafe Fane Knyghte: Roberte Crowley Wyshethe the Lyfe euerlastynge Pleasure and Payne. Wh? Christ shall come to iudge vs all and geue eche one Mat. xvi. as he hath wrought Hys fathers frendis then wyll he call To enioye that whych they haue sought By beleueng that they were bought Wyth his bloude shedde vpon a tree As by theyre workis Mat. vii. all men maye see Come, come, shall he saye to these men Come and possesse for euermore Mat. xxv. That kyngdome whych my father when No worlde was made layed vp in store For you, whome he dyd knowe before To be in maners Rom. viiilyke to me That am his sonne and aye haue be Come shall he saye for aye when I Stode nede of meate ye gaue me fode Mat. xxv.So dyd you drynke when I was drye Reioyceng when you dyd me good No fende therefore shall chaynge your mode For you shall alwayes be wyth me And shall my fathers i. Cor. xiii.godheade se And at all tymes when I haue bene Of nedefull lodgeynge Mat. xxv.desolate You haue bene gladde to take me in Whether it were yarly or late You dyd me neuer chyde nor rate But gaue me wordis curteyse and kynde Procedynge from a faythfull mynde. So when I was naked and bare Hauynge no clothes my fleshe to hyde From your owne backs Mat. xxv. then dyd you spare And gaue me clothes for backe and syde So that I myght the colde abyde. But if you lackt sufficient Then dyd you my greate lacke lament. Infyne, when I was weake and sycke And had no conforte aboute me To come to me you dyd not stycke Mat. xxv.And succour my necessitie And when it chaunced me to be In prisone and could not get oute To raunsome me you went aboute. Then shall the iuste Mat. xxvanswere agayne And saye, O lorde, when sawe we the In prisone or in other payne Through extreme nede and pouertie? Arte not thou lorde of lande and see? What? lorde we knowe that sea and lande Haue euermore bene in thyne hande We know that thou gaueste all thynge i. Cor. iiii. To all estates boeth hygh and lowe There is no myghty lorde nor kynge But he is in thyne hande we knowe. In vayne lorde we might plante and sowe If thou gaue vs not frute and grayne We coulde haue nought lyfe to sustayne Then shall Christe saye, all this is true I gaue you lyfe. and dyd you fede Wyth graynes and fruitis boeth olde and newe And gaue you all thyngis at your nede In all your wayes I was your speede And gaue you that wherefore ye sought wych wythout me Iohn. xv.had come to nought. Yet all that I haue sayde before Is true also, for when you gaue Ought to such as were sycke or sore Whome nede constray forto craue Then I confesse my selfe to haue Mat. xxvReceyned all that at your hande Whereof they dyd in greate nede stande. Then shall the iuste wyth ioye enter Into the ioyes that shall not ende Bycause theyr hertes were aye tender To geue such thyngis as god dyd sende Mankynde from peryle to defende. Mat. vi. Thus shall they lyue in ioye and blysse In paradice where no payne is. But to the wycked Christ shall saye. Auoyde frome me ye wycked sorte For in my nede you sayde me naye Mat. xxv. Wyth spytefull wordis Of disconforte Yet my preachars dyd you exhorte Me in my membres to refreshe i. Corhi. x. knoweynge that all are but one fleshe. Then shall these men Mat. xxv.wyth faynte herte saye Lorde when dyd we see the in nede? Thou haste bene lorde and Kynge alwaye No wyght was whome thou dydest not fede All this we learned in oure Creede, For thou arte Iesus, that Gods sonne That hath create boeth sonne and mone. Oh, shall Christe saye to them agayne, Ye deafe dorepostis coulde ye not heare? i. Cohr. xiiThynke you the heade bydeth no payne When the members make heauye chere? In you, nought but flesh doeth appere. For if my spirite in you had ben Me in myne you must nedis haue sene. The pore, the pore, and indigent Came vnto you ofte tymes ye knowe And you sawe them wepe and lament Yet would ye not on them bestowe The leaste frute that to you dyd growe No no, you were redy to take That other gaue them for my sake. Your hertis were harder then the flynt In them no pitie Ezech. 33. coulde be founde Your greedye gutte coulde neuer stynt Tyll all the good and fruitfull grounde Were hedged in whythin your nownde. You wycked sorte, howe vsed ye, The londis and goodis ye had of me? You made your boaste all was your owne To spare or spende, at your owne wyll And when any pore men were knowne Mat. xxi[illeg.]That were so bolde to calle it yll My landis and goodis in waste to spyll You shet them vp in prisone strong? Tormentynge them euer emonge. False libertynes you dyd them call Because they tolde you your duitie You sayde the loselles woulde haue all That you had goten paynfully And kept longe tyme moste carefully, But ye belye them I know well And slaunder this my true Gospell Emonge all myne there is not one That would haue ought more then his owne As I shall tell you playne anone For to me all Luke. xvi. theyr hertis be knowne They reaped nought that you had sowne, But wylled you to let them haue That I gaue you mankynde to saue Not one so blynde emonge you all But he knoweth I made all of nought Appoyntynge all thyngis Psal. viiinaturall To serue mankynde, whome I haue wrought Lyke to my selfe Gensis. i.in loueyng thought Wyllynge that eche should at his nede, Haue breade and Broth. harbour and wede. But syth it was expedient That emonge all there should be some, Alwaye sycke, sore and impotent, I indued you wyth such wysedome As dyd honest stuardis become Cammittyng whole Mat. [illeg.]. into your hande The riches boeth of sea and lande. My purpose was that you should haue Alwaye all nedefull thynges in store To succour such as nedis must craue Of you thyngis nedefull euermore I made you rych to fede the pore But you lyke seruauntis prodigall Haue in excesse Mat. 2[illeg.]. consumed all But when I found you negligent In fedynge of my family Then my prophetes to you I sent Commaundyng that you should yerely Matt. iiiBrynge all your tythes diligently Into my barne that there myght be Meate in myne house for pouertie. But you gaue to theyr wordis no hede You helde all faste and woulde nought brynge Into my barne the pore to fede But spent all at your owne lykynge Gene. 32.In wantones and banketynge And in rayment past your degree As men that had no mynde of me Yea some of you were not content To holde fast that ye should haue brought Into my barne, there to be spent But gredyly Iohn. x. ye begde and bought That my true seruantis as they ought Dyd at my true prophetis byddynge Into my barne faythfully brynge And when you had once goten in Into my folde emonge my shepe Then you thought it to be no synne Styll in your kennells forto slepe Settyng such ones my flocke to kepe As were more lyke Iohn x.to eate the lambe Then to defende his feble dame Ezech. 34.ye robde, ye spoylde, ye bought, ye solde My flocke and me, in euery place Ye made my bloude vylar then golde And yet ye thought it no trepasse O wycked sorte voyde of all grace Auoyde from me downe into hell Wyth lucifer there shall ye dwell Ye had the tythes of mens encrease That shoulde haue fedde Ezech. 34.my flocke and me But you made your selfes well at ease And toke no thought for pouertie It dyd not greue you sor to se My flocke and me suffer greate nede For lacke of meate, harbour and wede. No Hell can be a worthy payne For your offence it is so greate For you haue robbed me and slayne My flocke for lacke of nedefull meate The woule, the lambe the malt and wheate You dyd by force cary awaye And no man durst once saye you naye, Howe can you loke to haue mercie At myne hande? whome ye would not feede Wyth that was myne euen of dutie To succoure me and myne at nede? Syth you myght in the scripture rede That suche men shall no mercie haue Iacob. ii.As kepe theyr owne when nede doethe craue Unto the Hungry Esai. viiiparte thy breade And when thou shalt the naked se. Put clothes on him, this myght you reade In my Prophetis that Preached me And in Iohns Pistle these wordis be. Howe can that man haue Charitie That beynge riche sheweth no pitie? Also, the man Prou. xxii that stoppeth his eare At the crye of such as be pore Shall crye, and no man shall him heare Nor at his nede shewe him succoure Ryght so, he that Prou. xxii doeth endeuoure To be made rych by oppressynge Shall leaue him selfe (at the last) no thynge. For he shall geue the ryche alwaye More then he can scrape frome the pore So that in tyme he shall decaye And haue no nedefull thynge in store This might you reade and ten tymes more In the bible, that holy boke If you had had Math. x.tyme forto loke But such scriptures you coulde not broke As bade you geue ought to the pore You wyshed then out of the boke But you were suer to haue in store Plentie of scripturs euermore To proue that you myght aye be bolde Wyth your owne to do what you woulde You thought you myght your goodis employ To priuate gayne in euery thynge You thought it no faute to anoye Such men as were Mat. vii. nygh you dwellynge Were it by purchaise or byldynge Neither to get into your hande, Your neyghbours hous[illeg.] his goodis and lande All was your owne that you myght bye Or for a long tyme take by lease And then woulde you take rent yerely Much more then was the tenantis ease Luke. iii. It was no faute your rentis to rease From twentie markis to fourtie powndis Were it in tenementis or growndis What though the pore dyd lye and dye For lacke of of Harboure in that place Where you had goten wyckedly By lease or else by playne purchase All houseynge that shoulde in that case Haue ben a slafegard and defence Agaynst the stormy violence? Yea what if the pore famyshed For lacke of fode vpon that grownde The rentes whereof Math. x.you haue reysed Or hedged it wythin your mownde? There myght therwyth no faute be founde, No though ye bought vp all the grayne To sell it at your pryce agayne You thought that I woulde not requyre the bloude of all suche at your hande, But be you sure eternall fyre Is redy for eche hell fyrebrande, Boeth for the housynge and the lande That you haue taken Iacob. ii. from the pore Ye shall in Hell dwell euermore, Yea that same lande that ye dyd take From the plowemen that laboured sore Causeynge them wycked shyftis to make. Shall nowe ly vpon you full sore You shalbe damned for euermore The bloude of them that dyd amisse Mat. xviiiThrough your defaute is cause of this The fathers whose children dyd growe In Idlenes to a full age Woulde fayne be excused by you That were the cause that they dyd rage You toke from them theyr heritage Leaueyng them nought wheron to worcke Which lacke dyd make them learne to lurke The sones also that wycked were And wrought after theyr wycked wyll Would nowe ryght fayne be proued cleare Bycause your mysse hath made them Ille But they muste nedis be gyltie styll Because they woulde worke wyckedly Rather then lyue in miserie And yet shall you answere for all Theyr bloude I wyl Ezech. iii of you require Because you were cause of theyr falle That are become vesselles of Ire Boeth they and you shall haue your hyre In Hell emonge that wycked sorte That lyue in paynes wythout conforte. Infyne, all such as dyd amysse Through your defaut, what so they be Shall lyue in payne that endlesse is Because they would not credite me That am the trueth and verite I tolde them if Hebru. xiithey were opprest I woulde se all theyr wrongis redreste The wycked sorte that dyd rebell Agaynst you when you dyd them wronge Shall haue theyr parte wyth you in Hell Where you shall synge a dolefull songe Worlde wythout ende you shall be stonge Wythe the pricke of the conscience Eccles. vii A iuste rewarde for your offence. And you that woulde nedis take in hande To guyde my flocke, as shepheardis shoulde Onlye to possesse rent and land And as much richesse as you coulde To leade your lyfe euen as you woulde Auoyde from me downe into hell Wyth Simon Magus there to dwell Actu. viii If I should rehearse all at large That in your wycked lyfe is founde And laye it strayght to your charge No wyght there were in this world rownde But woulde wonder Genes. 7.I had not drownde The hoole earth for your synne onlye That woulde be called my cleargie Firste (wyth Magus) ye made your waye Lyke gredy woulles into my folde Your wycked wyll coulde fynde no staye So longe as ought was to besolde Either for seruice or for golde, By you the patrons fell from me And are become as Ill as ye You dyd prouoke them fyrste to sell And then they learned forto bye Thynkynge that they myght bye as well As the leadars of the clargie. And then they founde meanes by and by To catch and kepe in theyr owne hande The tenth increase by sea and lande Theyr owne chyldren they dyd present Theyr seruauntis and theyr wycked kynne And put by such as I had sent To tell my people of theyr synne And youe were gladde Iohn. x. to take them in Bycause you knewe that they dyd knowe That youe came in by the wyndowe Such as woulde haue entryd by me That am the dore of my shepe folde You sayde were not worthy to be Admitted into my householde You thought by them you should be tolde Esaie. xxxOf your moste wycked Simonie Your falsehead and your periurie Act xxiiiiYou layde to theyr charge Herecie Sisme and sedicion also But you dyd them falsely belye Thynckynge therby to worke them wo And doubtlesse ofte it chaunced so For many of them you haue slayne Wyth most extreme and bitter payne.

Let not the wealthy lyueynge here (Which can but a shorte tyme endure) Be vnto you a thynge so dere That you wyll lose endlesse pleasure Rather then leaue the vayne treasure O rather let your leases go Then they shoulde worke you endelesse woe. Rehore the tythes vnto the pore For blynde and lame shoulde lyue theron The wydowe that hath no succoure And the chylde that is lefte alone, For if these folke do make theyr mone To God, he wyll sure heare theyr crye And reuenge theyr wronge by and by. Restore your tythes I saye once more That trwe preachars may lyue theron And haue all nedefull thynges in store To geue to such as can get none Leste theyr greate lamentation Do styr the Lorde vengeaunce to take Euen for hys trueth and promes sake. Geue ouer your pluralities Ye men of God if you be so Betake you to one benifice, And let your lordelyke lyueuynges go, For holy wryte teacheth you so Learne at the laste to be content Wyth thynges that be sufficient. If you be mete to do seruice To any prince or noble man Than medle wyth no benifice For certenly no one man can Do the duitie of moe men than Of one: which duitie you do owe To them that geue you wage, you knowe Robbe not the people that do paye The tenth of theyr increase yerely To haue a learned guyde alwaye Present wyth them to edifie Them by teachyng the veritie Malac. iiiBoeth in his worde and eke his dede And to succoure such as haue nede And you that haue tane vsurie Of such as nede draue to borowe Make restitution shortly leste it turne you to great sorowe When no man can Psal xv. be your borowe Wich shalbe at the daye of dome Phil. iiii.

To make an ende let vs repent All that euer we haue mysse wrought And praye to god omnipotent To take from vs all wycked thought That his glory maye be styll sought By vs that be his creatures So longe as lyfe in vs endures And that henceforth eche man maye seke In all thyngis to profite all men And be in herte lowly and meke As men that be in dede Christen As well in herte as name and then We shall haue blysse wythouten ende Unto the which the lorde vs sende Amen.
