      <field name="fulltext">In prose or verse I shall rehearse The mighty stretch of pow'r, Nor stand in awe of Butcher Law Or any son of whore: To give a whet to smart, my pate, Subscribers must be willing: Claudero's scull is ever dull Without the sterling shilling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION TO THE GRAND CATCHPOLE OF THE WORLD [Verse has been extracted from prose] You struck the Harp of Heav'n so loud Olympus vaults resounded The gods themselves in wonder stood And Angels were confounded. THE Messengers HIGH ROAD TO DESTRUCTION. A HYMN, To be sung by CATCHPOLES every morning in their families. If I oppress mankind this day, Perdition be my lot; Let all I have fall in decay, My bowels in me rot. If widows and the fatherless, I e'er give cause to cry; Or pris'ner make the moneyless, despairing let me die. Such measure as I this day give, May it be met to me, And may my offspring never thrive, If I extort high fee. If guile and fraud or cruel deed, Flow from my heart or hand, Accursed be myself and seed May we be ever damn'd. A POEM, MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED TO SIR JOHN FIELDING, LONDON. Nemo sine crimine vivit. Ye judges wrapt in condemnation, delighting to weed God's creation, Say, if the rogues were pull'd away, Would not society decay? A fiddle never is in Tone, When all the strings are unison; If ev'ry Man were Neal the Printer, This world wou'd not be worth a splinter; For all mankind by Divine Grace, Are form'd to fill their proper place. Behold Claudero, as contrast To bigot and enthusiast: Let ev'ry sopho take rebuff, And see the fool in Jamie Duff; Or, read his lordship's wild relation Of human race in degradation, While others link them to the skies; Transplanting them to paradise. Why, if we had no whore or rogue, Ev'n honesty wou'd lose its vogue. The judges son oft turns a Thief, His wife and daughters whores, the chief; Ev'n wet and dry, as darkness, light, By interchanges, give delight. How can a judge correct the whore Who has oblig'd him oft before? How can he thieves or rogues controul, When weigh'd his avaricious soul? See king of pruss escape the rope And halters; far less robbers stop; And law seems but a trap of state, To hang low rogues, and save the great: Most of the pilf'ring in our nation, Alas! is owing to starvation; For 'tis a fact, or I'll be bang'd, Far worse to starve than to be hang'd. 'Tis no great virtue in the rich, For stealing to have little itch; But dire necessity invents A sinful shift, for want of Rents. The best way to reclaim a thief Is, feed the rogue with good roast beef; For whipping will have no effect; And death succeeds a corded neck. When labour's gone, and trade is dead, What shall mechanics do for bread? Sure in this kingdom few will stay, That can escape by any way. Labour to health and wealth conduces, But punishment more rogues produces; Ev'n so a hedge the closer grows, The oft'ner gard'ners top its rows: The milder laws are in a state, More honesty they do create: For when a rogue is once disgrac'd, To ev'ry crime he turns bare-fac'd. When judges act with moderation, They are the glory of a nation; Rogues may be hunted and pursu'd, But never finally subdu'd. The task will be Herculean, An office for a foolish man; For ev'n suppose rogues off were tore, The honest folk wou'd soon get more: Like Sysiphus the judge may groan, To roll eternally the stone, Which ay rebounding down the hill, The wretch is damn'd to roll it still. The growth of whores too in our nation, Is plainly owing to starvation: For, give the lasses work, and feed them, To honesty you soon will breed them: 'Tis meagre want, when destitute; That makes ev'n virtue prostitute; And humble beauty often must Be sacrific'd to op'lent lust; Which, void of sentiment, or shame, Ev'n boasts what it should blush to name. Were I disposed here to joke, I'd beg to hang the honest folk; The judge might then his task fulfill, And very little blood too, spill. 'Tis neither Englishman nor Scott, That lives on earth, and sinneth not: Let moderation justice bend, And mercy be your darling end, All God's creation will approve, Reclaim'd by goodness and by love. DORNOCK's Distress. A TRAGICAL DIALOGUE. SCENE I. Ecclefechin. Dornock Solus. O heavens support my every sense! A large estate! yet barr'd from pence! Trust deeds and curs'd adjudications, Bonds, inhibitions, damn'd vexations, Oppress my land and tear my soul, While interest on interests roll. A gentleman!—O hated name; Rapacious rogues pursue the game, Like as the hounds the timid hare, Sp?ll and others smell me there: M'M? too, fam'd for his nose, Blood suckers, false friends, worst of foes, Pursue my foot, they beat each brake, To pick my bones, me bankrupt make. Shall I worth twenty thousand pounds, Fall down a victim to these hounds. Where shall I fly to build relief? For sure each writer is a thief, Who will conjoin and lend their aid, Turn head and tail just as their paid; A broken Laird affords fine picking, To rascals whose sole trade is tricking: Yet to some one I must apply, That rogue 'gainst rogues his skill may try. A Pastor's son my neighbour near, Who also thirsts to swill my cheer, Must be my choice. Let fear be hush A drowning man will catch a bush. Enter Pastoris Filius, a writer. Pray Douglas, Dornock's rightful heir, Can I asswage or heal your care? Can I by law or subtile wile, By intervention those beguile, Whose steady scent tread on your toes— Say can I counteract your foes! For I am learned in the law, And will a disposition draw; In my own person vest your lands, To save it from the vulture's hands.— Advised be, haste, sign the deed.— You wont mistrust the Godly seed. Dornock. Stop short my buck, I smell a rat, And guess too what you're driving at; With sham pretexts you slyly aim, By cunning to run down the game; Such master strokes of writers skill Deter me from the dang'rous quill: I'll give a fee with all my heart, But not one fur of land I'll part; Here's a round sum, espouse my cause [giving a purse. I ask no shelter but from laws; Justice I want and ask no more, Procure me that for yellow Ore; But if you e'er assume to name Transferrence that detested game, I'll scorn your aid tho' son of church And in the abbey rather lurch, Let ev'ry villain do his worst, I'm Dornick; they may go be curst. [Pastoris Filius aside. I'm bauk'd by Jove,—he dreads my scheme.— And wont divest or yield the game.— Another project I must try, His creditors I'll artful ply, His debts I'll purchase, here and there, And then I'll hound him as a hare. [Exit. Vide Decreet of Ranking. SCENE II. Abby of Holyroodhouse Dornock Solus. Good God! my fate is wond'rous hard, A subject for a Tragic Bard, I'm rich, yet poor, a paradox, May ev'ry writer rot with pox. Betray'd and spung'd, harrass'd and chac'd, By muckworm rascals straitly lac'd, And forc'd to shelter in this place Where Duns in vain do show their face: Depriv'd of money, bilk'd by all. An Abbey Laird they Dornock call. Enter Scoundrel Grant. [Grant] Sir, may I make bold to ask the cause, Why here you shelter from the laws; Your face bespeaks your gentle birth, Tho' frowns o'ershade it more than mirth; Perhaps you have a large estate Encumbered with great debate: If so, I am an honest man, Descended from a martial clan; An agent too, my name is Grant, So pious, some folk call me saint: If you'll permit, I lend my aid, But agents act not till they're paid; Perhance just now you're scarce of cash, Yet watches here are arrant trash; Let me have that into your breeches And I will muster up some speeches: That without doubt will extricate And purge from debt our large estate. Dornock. The watch is Gold, and all that's left Of every Shilling I'm bereft; But if you're honest, as you say, The watch I'll freely give away: Here, take it, worthy Mr Grant, Too small a Fee for such a saint; But, pardon me, I have some doubt, Like my last Agent you'll turn out. Grant. May Poxes rot my Blood and Bones, As also mortify my Stones, If e'er I from your interest Swerve, But faithfully my Client serve. [Exit. Dornock solus. Was ever man so fool'd and bit? Damn Grant, the biggest scoundrel yet.— Sure Hell wont close while he is out.— I'm ruin'd now without all doubt. Enter a Banker of Probity and great Worth, taking Dornock by the hand. Banker. Dear gentle Sir, dispel your Grief. Accept my hand, accept relief, From Harpies I will set you free, Discharge them all and trust to me: A Bargain fair I'll instant make, Judge for yourself, my offer take. Dornock. Your gen'rous Soul has fired mine My lands are yours, the deed I'll sign.— I'm now above the power of want. And freed from that curs'd Scoundrel Grant: To him and Rascals not a few, I now for ever bid Adieu. [Exit. Enter Scoundrel Grant, Pastoris Filius, and their Associates. Grant. Rage, Vengeance, Fury, Aid me now, The lands are sold, what shall we do? Infom the Son, and spur him on— To law, to law, or we're undone. G. M: But where's the proof? their lies the Diel.— Grant. I'll swear for one, that he's facile Causa Scientiæ, here's his Watch, Which for a triffle I did catch. I will betray him all I can, And put his papers in your hand; Pastoris Filius too will join Though he has touched Dornock's Coin. We'll swear such Oaths and never flinch, As will convince the sacred Bench That he's a Man in human Shape, With intellects of puny Ape; And that the Banker over reach'd, By Doctrines base as e'er was preach'd. G. M. But if your Oaths should meet detection Where will such Roguery find Protection? Grant. Hell is the damn'd infernal shore, Where perjur'd Agents loudly roar, Nor Hell I fear, at my great Change, My Soul is bent on dire revenge. Exeunt Omnes. A POEM ON THE Lamentable Destruction of the Sign-posts in Edinburgh, Leith and Canongate, 1771. Number I. The Innovations of our day Deserve the Poets song, Melpomene come join the spray, And all the tuneful throng. Lament the Lyon of Will Hall, As also Omon's Bear; Now pinion'd fast unto the wall, No more they rear in Air. The Horse, the Bull, the Pugg, the Dog, The Eagle and the Swan; Let Hope now mourn his Golden Hog, And Young his Pelican. Neal's pretty Pigeons, harmless things, They now have flown away, And Binny's Beaver from his Rings, Alas! has gone astray. The Fox and scourge, the reaping Scythe, And eke the Lemon Tree, No longer make their owners blythe But fall to destiny. Craigillechin, that ancient rock, No more hangs over head Town Council Acts, like powder's stroke Will rend huge stones indeed. M'Dermid's Fir Tree ever green, Is blasted from its link; The best strong Ale that e're was seen We often there did drink. Now Pandœmonium is its name, For good Ale needs no bush; Both Saint and Sinner love the same, And to his Temple rush. The Sun, the Moon and sparkling Stars, O strange! are pulled down, And batted to the Walls with Spars, With many a Regal Crown. Orlando's Black with Boot in hand Has made a nice retreat; The pretty Boy yet makes his stand, Nor dreads the Council's hate The Turk's head too, where Lordly fare Did Nobles entertain, Is lopped off from Tavern rare Kept by the civil Bain. Wild's Ram, ridic'lous sign of Snuff, Hath too retrench'd his horn; Reid's Indian Queen too, wild enough, Is likewise backward born. Scot's Cock who stood for many years In wanton Lasses view, No more our Hens the Cockie cheers, For to his Roost he flew. Brave Brown's Hussar on Horse back rode, Well mounted Cap a pee; In Air no longer makes abode, At manger now is he. Like Jona's Gourd, thy Dial plate, O Skirven took its flight, For Time and Tide none will abide The morning flies to night. The great Gun too, from Airy field Is spik'd to yonder Wall; All you who wear the Sword and Shield, Lament this Cannon's fall. Great George the third, his Regal Bust, Is likewise pulled down, Dumbreck, at Treason now thou must Wear on thy brow a frown. In Niddry's wynd, Buchanan's head Points out a Dunces Shop, No science in his skull but greed, The learn'd head now must drop. Old barber Blair, thy antique Sign Must fall before thyself; Thy razor now thou may resign Which wont to bring thee Pelf. The Masons Arms of Him in Leith Are torn from off the shore, No wonder then he gnash his Teeth And give a brutal roar. No more he'll Judge the swift of foot Upon a Pillar's top, His visage black now as the soot Prognsticates a rope. Such havock in the Seventy one Was made in the good Town As made some laugh and others groan For Public weal we own. [Number II.] In doleful strains the theme pursue, Condole each plunder'd street, From port to port, O muse review, the havock now compleat. But spare to scourge the drown'd in Grief, And softly slide along; Lament the Tinsel of my Chief, Let Gavin grace my song. The Patentee can ne'er compare The leather works of thine, Tho' now thy boot hangs not in Air, Thy science needs no sign. Our Cousin James, his gilded key Must fall too by this doom, The chief of Vulcan's pedegree May he for ever bloom. Cockburn's dragon and St. George No more attracts our eye, St. Andrew too has got the scourge: O strange impiety! Thou Ceres Goddess of the sheaf, Which grac'd Ralph Hardie's shop, Thy fall beforc Autumnal leaf Fled with Clark's Telescope. Oe'rwhelm'd in Grief we mortals view The Gods descend to fate, Old Adam's fall our guild renew, While Richmond tears his Pate. The Barbers Poles and Dyers too, No longer shall appear; M'Bain's Star is ecclipsed now, In this destructive year. Now Bremner's Harp shall point no more Appolo's Sons the way, Nor Ossian's head the loyal Shore Where honesty bore sway. Ill Fortune snatch'd the Cross Keys too, The Anchor left its hold, Miln's candlesticks to patmos flew, Where they were seen of old. The Whale no longer leads the way To Bacchus sons of joy, The golden horse has gone astray; Great pity to destroy. The pine apple is swallow'd down The sugar loaves are gone, The Black's head sold best snuff in town; Is likewise overthrown. M'kell has wreck'd his fishing boat, His salmon is no more, His cages now as lumber rot, On the destructive shore. The Black bull stood for seventy years, At last has turn'd his tail; The lion red, yet still appears, As old behind the jail. The lanthorns and the trumpets loud, No favour could obtain: No quarter giv'n to rich or proud, To save them was in vain. Such hurly burly and such din, By this sad devastation, Some said such havock was a sin And scandal in our nation. Dumbreck to London sent express, For grace and for reprive, His Majesty cannot do less; May regal busts long thrive. May Heav'n preserve our Weather-cocks, Onr steeples and our spires; Our royal statues keep from strokes, From Thunder and from fires. Number II. Readers, indulge me this third time, Sometimes in prose, sometimes in rhime To say or sing as suits me best, My tale of sign-posts now at rest. George Mackie's ship with full spread sail, Has suffer'd by this violent gale. His wife she was a princess born, Her father never wore a horn; He manufactur'd booots and shoes, And by assistance of his spouse, Fair tenements in portsburgh rear'd, Was both a poet and a laird. Right wonderfull was this same case, For poets seldom have such grace; But in top stories not their own, Like Claud, spue nonsense thro' the town. A specimen of Crispin's verse, In his own words I shall rehearse; Wrote underneath the knife and crown, Which shows he was a witty lown. “I John Rammage wi' my ain hands Wan the Siller that bigget thir lands, And Elspet Black, my sweet-heart, Span the thread, and plaid her part.” Blackwood in Calton, how unfit To match his merit, craft, or wit, At best thou'rt a seceding elf; And lasts thy conscience for the pelf. The Calton Vulcans can no more Hang ecce signums o'er each door, For them my muse bore great regard, And wish'd such plunder had been spar'd, For labour's theirs, and decent worth, Each Wednesday sets their merit forth: Their works bear witness on the street, That they are vulcan's sons compleat. Cam'ron and Carol just and true, In Canongate their trade pursue; For upholstry work, they London brave, And call none of their bus'ness knave, Nor go about like Lupus Lamb, Their brothers work to court or damn. No crown or cushion or death train, But all is simple neat and plain. Matchless assurance is thy own, Thy impudence even scorns a frown; How much unlike to brother Russel, Who acts upright despising bustle. You taylors now in potter-row, Whose signs, once proud, are now laid low; For shame your funds no more devour, But give subsistence to your poor; Lest Egypt's plagues attack your borders, And fill your bosoms with disorders. Great Granby's bust has gone to pot, From Duncan's door receiv'd a shot; We mourn in vain this fatal deed, For laurels should have crown'd his head. The knives, the scissars and the saw, Which lately in Leith wynd did fa', Shall never wound, far less o'erthrow, Boog's edge tools please both high and low. Bad ale in new street's on a door, Design'd for wit you may be sure, Yet true it is as I'm alive, How can this house expect to thrive? Drunk Pate Stev'n upon the walk, Now cease I beg, thy beastly talk, Thy gallows sign is pulled down, Before the gallows got its own. A rope is an informers due, Pray Pate does it belong to you? A Leghorn nose becomes thee Steel On shore of Leith squeez'd cash you feel, And damns all those for want of sense, Whose cabinets are scarce of pence. My son get money is the rule, And he who wants it is a fool. Tom Soot forgive and be forgiv'n, Or else thy arms will ne'er reach Heav'n, Claud was provok'd, the fault was thine, Hail welcome Tom to thy propine. FINIS.</field>
