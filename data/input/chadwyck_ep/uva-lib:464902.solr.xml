      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. JACK THE GIANT QUELLER, AN OPERA. [Verses extracted from the opera] Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for major characters are as follows: For Plut. read Plutus or Wealth. For 1st Beg. read 1st. Beggar. For Gallig. read Galligantus or Power. For 1st. Shep. read 1st Shepherd. AIR I. Tune, “At the tree I shall suffer with pleasure.” I The Laws they were made for the Little, The Laws they were made for the Little, In the hands of the Strong, All the ties, that belong To Justice and Honour, are brittle. II The Laws they were made for the Little, The Laws they were made for the Little, Though Churchmen may preach, And Philosophers teach, The Great will not list to a tittle. III The Laws they were made for the Little, The Laws they were made for the Little; It is not by Right, But by wrong-doing Might, That Giants still scape a Committal. AIR II. Plut. This scepter'd hand all nations own, All religions hold divine— I the king of every throne; I the god of every shrine! II Gold is every woman's lust; Gold is every man's desire; Gold the covert patriot's gust; Kneel my sons, and own your sire! AIR III. Tune, “Moll Roe.” Plut. Would you silence a Patriot committee, Touch their lips with this magical Wand; Through country, and senate, and city, 'Tis the lock and the key of the land. II Take a piece of this same from your coffer, Display to the Voter your pelf; And the wretch, having nothing to offer, Will frugally sell you—Himself. III 'Tis a shot for the fowl of all feather, A bait for the gust of all fish; To this every gudgeon will gather, And plump, ready drest, in your dish. IV If the booby, your Pupil, so dull is, He scarce can remember his name; Yet his mouth it shall open, like Tully's, When fed with a spoon of this same. V To a rascal, a bear, and a blockhead, Unconscious of mood, or of tense, This plastic receipt, in his pocket, Gives grace, figure, virtue, and sense. VI Old Saints will for this sell their manuals; O'er this, at your sovereign nod, Old Judges will skip like young spaniels, And Cardinals kiss you this rod. VII To study aught else is but nonsense; From hence all Philosophy springs— 'Tis the Crown, Beauty, Cause, and Good Conscience, Of Priests, Ladies, Lawyers, and Kings. AIR IV. Tune, “Peggy Benson.” I In the Church, where your dignifi'd doctors you find, Such holy men refrain, son; For, uplifted by us, and our offices kind, Their sanctify'd pride they sustain, son. II Let governors thrive, and each Prince, on his throne, In peace and plenty reign, son; Till you find that by talents, and virtue, alone, One man shall to honour attain, son. III Let Party in turbulent senates debate, Nor matters it who shall gain, son; Till you find that one act for the good of the state, Shall have enter'd in either's brain, son. IV Let the law be your care, nor one tittle retrench, But support each furr'd robe in its station; For they, as our substitutes, sit on the bench, To decide the affairs of the nation. V In Cities, tho' Czars of a pitiful sphere, Would you know who would be our relation? 'Tis the Alderman's Worship, and sudden Lord Mayor, Who struts through his yearly creation. VII Each fox-hunting justice and landlorded youth, Are prone to your point, when they may, son; For these, too, are little Grand Signiors, forsooth, And Giants, each man in his way, son. AIR V. Tune, “If all the fair maids.” I Ambition lik Jack-o'-the-Lanthorn bewitches; Ambition like Jack-o'-the Lanthorn bewitches; And leads; you benighted through dirt and through ditches. Dol de dol, &amp;c. II Your griping for gold, a beggarly itch is; Your griping for gold, a beggarly itch is; And virtue, tho' humble, looks down upon riches. Dol de dol, &amp;c, III Your great men, and statesmen, the higher their pitch is, Your great men, and statesmen, the higher their pitch is, By climbing the broader, but shew us their breeches. Dol de dol, &amp;c. AIR VI. Tune, “Dole and woe fa our Cat. I How often our Mother has told, And sure she is wonderous wise! In cities, that all you behold, Is a fair, but a faithless disguise: That the modes of a court education Are train-pits, and traitors to youth; And the only fine language in fashion, A tongue that is foreign to truth. II Where Honor is barely an oath; Where knaves are with noblemen class'd; Where nature's a stranger to both; And love an old tale of times past Where laughter no pleasure dispenses, Where smiles are the envoys of art; Where joy lightly swims on the senses, But never can enter the heart. III Where hopes and kind hugs are trepanners; Where Virtue's divorc'd from success; Where cringing goes current for manners, And worth is no deeper than dress. Where Favour creeps lamely, on crutches; Where Friendship is nothing but face; And the title of Duke, or of Duchess, Is all that entitles to Grace. AIR VII. Tune, “Lochaber.” Jack. Farewel to my Gracey, my Gracey so sweet, How painful to part!—but again we shall meet. Thy Jack, he will languish, and long for the day, That shall kiss the dear tears of his sister away. Tho' Honour, in groves of tall laurel, should grow; And fortune, in tides, should eternally flow; Nor Honour, nor Fortune thy Jack shall detain, But he'll come to his Gracey, his Sister again. II Again, at our door, in the morning of spring, To see the sun rise, and hear Gold-finches sing; To rouse our companions, and maids of the May, In copses to gambol, in meadows to play. Or, at Questions and Forfeits, all rang'd on the grass: Or to gather fresh chaplets, each Lad for his Lass; To sing, and to dance, and to sport on the plain, Thy Jack shall return to his Gracey again. III Or alone, in his Gracey's sweet company blest, To feed the young Robins that chirp on the nest; To help at her med'cines, and herbs for the poor, And welcome the stranger that stops at the door. At night, o'er our fire, and a cup of clear ale, To hear the town-news, and the Traveller's tale; To smile away life, till our heads they grow hoar, And part from my sheep, and my Gracey no more. AIR VIII. Tune, “Dremondoo.” Grace. O now he has left me, what care shall employ, What object afford me the shadow of joy? To a heart so o'erladen, all Sorrows are meet; Misfortune is welcome, and mourning is sweet! II Away, ye companions of daily delight, And pastimes that gently could steal on the night Away, ye fond sports of the wake, and the fair! Your pleasures are vanish'd—no brother is there! III Of the Ball, and the Hurling, the Dance, and the Race, His skill was the victor, his person the grace: The Maidens throng'd round him, delighted to see, And wish'd they had all been his sisters, like me. IV Thus, every dear scene of my former delight, To my mind will recal him, but not to my sight; The trees will all droop, and the meadows look lone; And all say—poor maid! thy Companion is gone! AIR IX. Tune, “Grana Weil.” I Though passions contend, and afflictions storm, And shake the frail state of the human form; If virtue the base of our pile sustain, Afflictions shall rage and assault in vain. II The path for the steps of all mortals made, Is simply to follow, where Truth shall lead: Nor thou from its rectitude turn aside; The rest, let hereafter, and heaven provide. AIR X. Tune, “I have six pence under my thumb.” I How sweet the gossiping birds that sing! How sweet the treasure the zephyrs bring, Light wafted on each odoriferous wing That winnows the breast of flowery spring! II How sweet the showers with balm replete! The fawns that frolic, and lambs that bleat! But O! above all, though all should meet, Our Justice, our Queen of sweets is sweet! AIR XI. Tune, “To you fair Ladies now on land.” Justice. The world, a faithless ocean, tost By passion's stormy wind, Is spread with spoils of thousands lost, The wreck of human kind; Where all the freight their vessels bear, Is but a wilful weight of care. Dol lol, &amp;c. II For what can Reason's feeble hand, Before the helm perform, Where he can spy nor port, nor land, To scape from stress, or storm— Where Hope, amid the raging main, Her anchor casts,—but casts in vain? Dol lol, &amp;c. III O turn, misguided wights!—return To us, who smile on shore! To us, who, yet, your errors mourn, Your safety who implore! Your forfeit peace with us renew, Who shed no tears—except for you. Dol lol, &amp;c. AIR XII. Tune, “Twang-dillo dee.” Justice. But we to Nature who adhere, nor farther bliss require, To lop the root of all our care, we lop each vain desire. II We ask no Cynic law, nor saw, nor scrolls of bearded men; For Nature's the most learned book that Innocence can ken. III To baffle want, and sweeten toil, from debt and danger free; We learn instruction from the Ant, and the industrious Bee. IV From Dogs we learn unfailing faith, affection from the Dove; And from the Hen, who guards her Chick, a Parent's circling love. V And last, we, to all bounteous Heaven, our daily tribute yield; Taught by the fragrant incense breath'd from every grateful field. AIR XIII. Tune, “Ye Commons and Peers.” Jultice. The time to beguile, Now listen a while. And I'll shew you an excellent plot; How Husband and Wife, Thro' the crosses of life, May be held by the true-lover's knot. II As mortals are frail, Let indulgence prevail, And all mutual infirmities blot; Let the Husband but own His Wife errs not alone, And I'll vouch for the true-lover's knot. III My Dolly so bright, Should your Hob, over night, Be surprized by his pipe, or his pot; Let him sleep his dose out, Nor, by scolding or pout, Strive to loosen the true-lover's knot. IV When your Wives they grow grey, And their graces decay, Of all mortal beauty the lot; Remember their youth, And, by friendship, and truth, Make eternal the true-lover's knot. AIR XV. Tune, “A begging we will go.” 1st Beg. However some in Coaches, on Barrows some may beg; 'Tis want that makes the Mendicant, and not the wooden leg. When a begging they do go, &amp;c. II 'Tis thus, by greater poverty, that Nobles grow renown'd; For where we want a penny, friend, State Beggars want a pound. And a begging they do go, &amp;c. III Your Courtier begs for Honour—and that's a want indeed! As many should for Honesty, but will not own their need, When a begging they should go, &amp;c. IV Your Vizier begs for subsidies, your Party-man for place; Your Church-man, for a benefice;—but not a man for Grace, When a begging they do go, &amp;c. V Thus all, from Rome to London, are of the begging train; But we, who beg for Charity—must look to beg in vain, When a begging we do go, &amp;c. AIR XV. Tune, “Fie, let us awa to the Wedding.”Jack. Yet many, when Beggars are pressing, Of bounty are nothing loth; The Bishop will give you—his blessing; The Officer give you—his oath. Of his promise, to be a free donor, The Courtier is little nice; And Great-ones will give you—their Honour! For these are of little price. AIR XVI. Tune, “A Cobler there was.” Jack.I You yet may behold the surprize of the town, To see truth elated, dishonour pull'd down; All tricks, low and little, despis'd by the Great, And Honesty fix'd for a maxim of State! Derry down, &amp;c. II To see our lac'd Lordlings deserving of trust; Our Clergymen pious, our Justices just; Our Court Ladies blush; and our thing of a Beau, A something, beside a mere nothing but shew. Derry down, &amp;c. III To see worth and talents to office preferr'd; The Virtuous rewarded; the Vicious deterr'd; And the streams of polution, where people resort, New fed from the clarify'd springs of our Court. Derry down, &amp;c. IV To see Freedom loyal; Elections unbrib'd; All Faction exil'd, and Corruption proscrib'd: Pure Nature exalted o'er masking and art; And Dominion possess'd of it's seat in the heart. Derry down, &amp;c. V To see Mirth, with Innocence, walking the land; And Probity taking Free-trade by the hand; And the Courts of our Law from iniquity clear, O then, what a rare revolution were here! Derry down, &amp;c. Chorus. And the Courts, &amp;c. AIR XVII. Tune “Chevy Chace But since by mortals 'tis confest, The shafts of Fate must fall; I'll take firm Patience to my breast, And smile, secure of all. AIR XVIII. Tune, “Delia, by Arne.” Jack. O form'd of harmony and light! Too bright for sense to bear! Art thou to feeling as to sight? Essential as thou'rt fair? II If some illusion from the skies, In pity yet delay; Nor melt, sweet object, from my eyes; In fleeting air away! AIR XIX. Tune, “Two Gossips they luckily met.” I The Indies thy Toilet shall grace; For thee shall earth, ocean, and air, From the gin, and the net, and the chace, Each costly collation prepare. II All seasons their sweets shall dispense, And a round of long happiness roll; And bliss, through the gates of each sense, Shall enter and mix with thy soul. III Fair Phœbe shall light up her horn, To watch the repose of thy charms; And each blushing and rapturous morn Shall find thee reclin'd in my arms. AIR XX. Tune, “Who'll see my Gallantee Shew.” Jack. I'll first present you a prime minister, See from thought or action sinister! Public good his square and measure; Himself his Country's trust and treasure. And is not this a shew? II Here's Humility in high station! Dignity stript of ostentation! Friendship, here, outgoes profession; Here is power, without oppression! Oh the finest shew! III Who'll see honesty in a Miser? Fops, from France, return the wiser? Wealthy Poets, and poor Receivers? Lawyers in future rewards believers? Oh the curious shew! IV Here's dependance, without servility; Peers, to Virtue who owe Nobility; Next, where Piety weds with Prelacy: But you scarce will credit, till you see, Such a wond'rous shew! AIR XXI. Tune, “Poddreen Mare.” Jack. Come all you gay Gallants, for pleasure who proul! Come all you young Racers, who strain for the goal! Come all you stout Wrestlers, who strive on the plain! Come all you fond Merchants, who trade on the main! Come all, who expend your short candle, in quest Of phantoms, still follow'd, but still unpossest! In vain you search, wander, strain, struggle, and steer! The Prize you all wrestled, and run for, lay here. AIR XXII. Tune, “Suba roo roo.”Jack. Who will buy? who will buy? Observe, and you'll own, Sir, In each radiant stone, Sir, Is pictur'd the Virtue, And Grace they refer to; Will you buy Sir?— AIR XXIII. Tune, “Bohil beg buee.”Jack. Here Probity stands confest; His truth on his visage exprest: For his face is of kin to the beauty within, That keeps festival still in his breast. AIR XXIV. Tune, “My Father and Mother sent me far.” Jack For lo! her wealth all spent on want, Where Charity's reclin'd! The moving tale of wretchedness Still rolling in her mind. Her sighs and tears are still a fund Of bounty to distress; And she delights to share the woe She can no more redress. AIR XXV. Tune, “My Dog and my Gun.” Jack. On what a firm rock, here, does Fortitude fix! Around him, in war, all the elements mix! The hurricane rages! the tempest it boils! Loud thunders are launch'd at his head—and he smiles! Lady. My honest Gentleman, so pert, and queer, What must I give you for this trifle here? Jack. Your insolence of riches, that mislead Your steps from real wealth, and make you poor, indeed. AIR XXVI. Tune, “Æneas wand'ring Prince of Troy.” Jack. Humility, her crown aside, Here stoops to wash the feet of Pride. Averse from all the world calls great, She fain would fall, and sink from state! But sink or fall, howe'er she will, She finds the world beneath her still. Lady. Your pleasure for this Gem so bright and strange? I barter all my fortune in exchange! Jack. Demand some other time.—You offer well.— The price, in public, I'm right loth to tell. AIR XXVII. Tune, “Past one o'Clock.” How mild, in this ruby, pale Chastity flushes; And tinctures with crimson her form of light! Unconscious of guilt;—at her beauty she blushes, And wraps each proportion, and charm from sight. All hush'd as rock'd infants, all sweet as the folding rose, Her lips, with reluctance, the balm of her breath disclose! Her eyes look abash'd at their brightness, yet still she shews Brighter by veiling whate'er is bright! AIR XXVIII. Tune, “The bonny Christ Church Bells” Jack. Would you wear this Pearl so rare? Then, Fair-one, list to me, First learn the skill your tongue to still; And leave the name and honest fame of others free. Your tittle-tattle, prate and prattle,—rake and rattle, all Due victims to this Pearl must fall. Your joys in toys, of folly, fops, and noise, That, noon and night, the toy-shop of your heart employs; The side long glance, and kindling dance, Minc'd mein, and conscious eye; With foibles which, you know, in shame I spare to shew; A price, I fear, too high. AIR XXIX. Tune, Bumpers Squire Jones.” Jack. Since, Sir, you require Me with freedom to tell you the price I desire; If duly obey'd, I must claim all your shifts, Mean resources, sly drifts, And whole system of trade. Each method of weaving Court nets for enslaving; Your chaffer for conscience, by barter and lure: State quacks, and state nurses; Your purging of purses; And skinning of wounds, which you wish not to cure. II Each subtle essay Of spreading corruption, in order for sway; All projects for rule, By the bait, and the bribe, And political tribe, Of trick, traffic, and tool. Your Court-broom, that gathers Motes, chaff, straw, and feathers, And sweeps up all trash from the surface of life. With your largess of graces, Posts, pensions, and places, Where talents and office are ever at strife. III With these, I must claim Your entry of red-coated gentry, who dream That Heroes are made, And enabl'd to kill, By the courage and skill Of a dreadful cockade! A race, who are prouder To spend their sweet powder At balls, than on bullets,—a terrible train Of crimp petit-maitres, Nice seamsters and plaiters, Beau'd out, for the dance of a dainty campaign! AIR XXX. Tune, “Ye fairy Elves that be.” Gallig. Come follow, follow me, You jolly boys all, who be Divested of constraint, From mortify'd Saw, or Saint! To pleasure and boundless licence free. Come follow, follow, follow me! Come all to measureless licence free, And follow, follow, follow me! II Let lean-ey'd Honesty bear His merited weight of care; And phlegm and conscience dwell In cynical tub, or cell; But all ye lovers of game, and glee, And feast and frolic, come follow me! To nature's measureless license free, Come follow, follow, follow me! III The pedanted Priest, who fain Wou'd ride, but wants a rein; To moral us into controul, Wou'd sour the jovial soul! The Priest is cunning, and so are we; Then Priest and People, come follow me! From scruple and qualm, and conscience free, Come follow, follow, me! XXXI. Tune, “Tiptelera.” 1st Shep. These gauntlets, we understand, From annals, time out of mind, Have giv'n due weight to each hand Of the bruisers of mankind. Still apt to his occupation Whom no restriction awes; Whose courage would cuff a nation, And quell both land and laws. AIR XXXII. Tune, “Ye Commons and Peers.” 1st Shep. Behold, from old times, Through all customs, and climes, The meed of ambition, and pride! 'Tis a gift, my good sirs, For him who, with spurs, On the back of his country would ride. Dol de rol, &amp;c. AIR XXXIII. Tune, “Old Roger.” 1st Shep. Sir, here is the zone, Dol lol de rol, &amp;c. By whose virtue alone Dol lol, &amp;c. Deservers are known, Dol lol, &amp;c. To look down on a throne, Dol lol, &amp;c. AIR XXXIV. Tune, “Ye fairy Elves that be.” Duet between Justice and Jack. I Arise, arise! arise! Each shape, and sort, and size Of Honesty, where ye lye, Unheeded, on dank or dry; From cottages, shades, and sheds, to court, My brothers of worth, and want, resort! Arise to labour, arise to play, For Virtue dawns a new born day! Chorus.Arise to labour, &amp;c. II To court, to court repair; Tho' destitute, poor, and bare; And yet unskill'd in aught That Euclid or Machiavel taught. By naked probity, you acquire A garb beyond the silk of Tyre; And more than talents, and more than art, Is furnish'd in an upright heart! Chorus.And more than, &amp;c. III Let jolity e'en devour His interval of an hour; Yet, pity his transient roar, For list—and he laughs no more! The purest pleasures that guilt can bring, Are like the tickling of a sting; The tickling leaves no sweet behind; The sting remains, and stabs the mind! Chorus.The tickling leaves, &amp;c. IV But Virtue, in the breast, Composes her halcyon nest; And sooths and smooths each storm, That wou'd the fair seat deform; Herself most frolic, and sweetly free To cordial jolity, cordial glee! The fountain of all that's blest and bright; Of orient pleasure, of orient light! Chorus.The fountain, &amp;c. V And, from this mental dawn, O'er village, and lake, and lawn; New radiance shall expand, To brighten each dusky land; While Truth, from this approving stage, Shall beam through every act, and age! CHORUS.While Truth from this approving stage, Shall beam through ev'ry act, and age. FINIS. RUTH: AN ORATORIO. PERSONS. BOAZ. HIGH PRIEST. NAOMI. RUTH. ISRAELITES. MOABITES. PART I. SCENE I. A Field in Moab. Israelite Travellers, and Naomi. RECITATIVE. 1st Isr. Stay, brother—see, in yonder shade, Some sable Daughter of Affliction laid! She rises—mark her mournful air! She looks, she moves, she breathes despair! Too great appears her woe, To suffer words to break away, or swelling tears to flow. RECITATIVE Accompanied. 2d Isr. 'Tis nought to us—Come, let's be gone— This land for us no friendship knows: All are strangers here, and foes!— Shall we regard a foe's distress?—no, brother, no!—pass on. AIR. 1st Isr. Thro' every clime, the heart humane Is pleased to share in every pain— There dwells a secret sense within, To frail mortality a-kin; And to the Child of humbling Grief, Or friend, or foe, it brings relief! CHORUS. Or friend, or foe, the Child of Grief From hearts humane will find relief! RECITATIVE. 1st Isr. Unhappy sister! whence the care, That seems above thy strength to bear? RECITATIVE. Nao. 'Tis an incurable despair!— RECITATIVE. 1st Isr. Yet if our power cannot relieve, our pity sure may share. RECITATIVE. Nao. Lopt from the trunk of Israel's tree, And stript of foliage and of fruit, a blasted branch you see! RECITATIVE. 2d Isr. Of Israel?—O, declare thy grief!— I hasten, now, to bring relief. AIR. Nao. Ah cease—your comforts come in vain! As on a barren rock they fall; Whence soft descending stores of rain, No blade of kindly growth can call. AIR. 1st Isr. From desolated lands, From rugged rocks, and parching sands, The powerful word of Israel's King Can call the beauties of the spring!— RECITATIVE. His hand the wounded heart can heal— But O, whence springs thy grief, reveal! RECITATIVE. Nao. Once I was blest, supremely blest! These arms a loved and loving consort prest— Two sons, beside, were mine—all now, alas, no more! Husband and children lost I'm destined to deplore! RECITATIVE. 1st Isr. Alas, sad matron!—May we claim Thy tribe, thy native place, and name? RECITATIVE. Nao. Of Judah's tribe, in Bethlehem's town, Naomi once was known. But late, when famine ravaged all our plains, I, with my houshold, succour sought from Moab's foreign swains. RECITATIVE. 2d Isr. Our sister!— 1st Isr. —O, our sister dear! 2d Isr. Return!— 1st Isr. Thy kin, thy country, chear! RECITATIVE. 2d Isr. The LORD hath visited our land, And on his chosen people pour'd the bounty of his hand! AIR, Duet. Rich verdure and blossoms again deck the spring, Again in the groves the wing'd choristers sing; Again the blithe milkmaid is heard at her pail, And the ploughman's glad whistle descends on the vale. RECITATIVE. Nao. Though fall my ills so heavy from his hand, I bless the LORD who saves my native land. Yes, happy soil! ye hills and vales of Grace! Thou sacred, pleasing, promised place! With thee, once more, these eyes shall glad their sight, Then closing bid a last adieu to mortal life and light! AIR. Dear Natal Earth, prepare my grave, Receive the fading form you gave! Dear Natal Earth, upon your breast, The fading form you gave, shall rest! RECITATIVE. 2d Isr. Cease, cease, O hapless sister! cease to mourn— Thy joyful friends shall hail thy wish'd return; Bethlehem exulting thy approach shall greet, And her throng'd ways spread flow'rs beneath thy feet. AIR. Let no wretched offspring of Adam despair— As passes our pleasure, so passes our care! Man's life is an April, now gloomy, now gay; His shade and his shine fleet successive away! To the pain thy Creator appoints thee resign, And seize the glad moment allowed to be thine. RECITATIVE. Nao. My friends, my country, now, Naomi scarce will own— To haughty Wealth in prosperous state, the Poor remain unknown! RECITATIVE. 1st Isr. As o'er a treasure lost and found, O'er thee thy kindred will rejoice around. AIR. O Israel, receive to thy breast, This thy daughter, so virtuous and dear! In thy songs be her welcome exprest, And her diffidence lost in thy chear! As her morning in clouds has begun, Let her noon in its progress be bright; And her evening, like summer's fair sun, Leave behind it a glory of light! END OF THE FIRST PART. PART II. SCENE I. Naomi, Ruth, and Moabites. RECITATIVE. Nao. Daughters of Moab, hear! By famine's hand Opprest, erewhile I left my native land— To you I came; ye took the stranger in, And fill'd the place of country and of kin. Now home recall'd, for leave to part I sue, And my full heart must take the last adieu! RECITATIVE. Moab. Wouldst thou their blessing from thy servants take? Your LORD loves Moab for Naomi's sake. AIR. Where'er thy visit is addrest, The household and the house are blest! RECITATIVE. Nao. Though you, my friends, I quit, my broken heart Leaves in your hospitable earth its better, dearer part! AIR. A long, long adieu, my kind neighbours, I take, Ye wealth of the wealthless, ye strength of the weak! While worth shall endear, or beneficence bind, Your memory shall hold the first place in my mind: And if ever your lot should oblige you to stray, May others the friendship you shew'd me repay! RECITATIVE. Ruth. Come, mother, come! no more indulge delay! Towards your Israel's pleasant land I long to bend my way. RECITATIVE. Nao. What means my daughter? would she leave Her friends of Moab for her loss to grieve? AIR. Ruth. Yes, mother, yes; with thee, Though faint from travel and from toil, Each land will prove a native soil, Each house a home to me! Companion'd with thee, as we journey along, No time can be tedious, no road can be wrong! RECITATIVE. By wedlock, Ruth, allied to thee, Became a graft of Israel's tree— So firmly fix'd, so strongly tied, No storm can shake, no stroke divide! AIR. Nao. O flower of Moab, passing fair! Say, shall my unpropitious hand Thee, from thy native garden, bear, To wither in a foreign land? RECITATIVE. Ruth. Some power, unconquerably strong, Impells thy daughter's steps along. AIR. As the LORD of thy Israel now reigneth above, In his Kingdom of Peace, and his Regions of Love, 'Tis in vain To restrain; With thee I will wander, with thee will remain. To the lot that is thine, Or pleasant, or painful, with joy I resign; Thy people, thy God, and thy grave, shall be mine! RECITATIVE. Nao. O child, above all kindred dear, Thou bless'd of our JEHOVAH, hear! AIR. I see, I see with other eyes, From darkness distant radiance rise! Soon shall the Promised Son be born, And come on Solyma like morn, Enlightening all her skies! CHORUS of Moabites. Amid the great the glorious thought, Our souls to future times are caught. We see, with other eyes, From darkness distant radiance rise! Soon shall the Promised Son be born, And come on Moab like the morn, Enlightening all her skies! END OF THE SECOND PART. PART III. SCENE I. Naomi, and Ruth. RECITATIVE. Nao. Turn, O daughter, turn thy eyes, Where Bethlehem's glittering spires arise— How fair her flowery vales extend! How bold her swelling hills ascend! AIR. Dear native Soil! do I again Thy kindly breeze inhale? No air of any foreign plain Could thus my sense regale. RECITATIVE. Ruth. Fair is thy land, O mother! wondrous fair! My bosom from the view strange transport seems to share. AIR. New scenes, and new prospects, my spirit employ, And with hopes of new happiness chear me; My heart all enliven'd indulges its joy, And some sudden blessing seems near me. RECITATIVE. Nao. Behold, my lovely child, behold, How Bethlehem's streets at our approach pour forth their young and old! SCENE II. Naomi, Ruth, Boaz, Israelites. CHORUS. Naomi?—lost and found again, O welcome to thy native plain! Raise all your voices, brethren, raise, And hail your sister's glad return with gratulating lays. RECITATIVE. Nao. Say, brethren, who is he that leads the throng, And like a hero moves majestical along? RECITATIVE. 1st Isr. 'Tis Boaz, Bethlehem's Prince, your near allied— Your first of kindred by your husband's side! AIR, Duet. Isr. His step is at a distance from thousands discern'd! When he speaks in the gate, Elders hear and grow learn'd! His couches are spread for the stranger's repose; For the naked he shears, for the hungry he sows! He stands like a tree in the midst of his ground, With the widow and orphan rejoicing around! RECITATIVE. Boaz. Hail, mother of thy people!—this embrace Bids thee thrice welcome to thy native place. Oft have those arms my infant years carest, And clasp'd thy little kinsman to thy breast! RECITATIVE. Nao. Hail, son!—May Heaven in bounty heap on thee Tenfold the blessings it has rent from me! RECITATIVE. Boaz. In this our present happy lot, Be past calamities forgot! But where is she, our new allied— Of Moab's land so late the pride? AIR. Nao. Lo there! like a mist on the morning, her veil Strives in vain to obscure her from sight; It betrays what it means to conceal, A beauty for vision too bright! RECITATIVE. Boaz. Thee, fairest Ruth, by Israel's law I claim, A glad succeeder to thy husband's name! Thrice have the visions of the night, Brought to my view thy semblance fair, that fill'd my tent with light! RECITATIVE. Ruth. If so your laws ordain, Your handmaid will not of her lot complain. RECITATIVE. H. Priest. Hear men of Bethlehem, and rejoice! The LORD informs his servant's voice— Yon portion fair of Moab's earth, To Israel's Chosen Plant gives birth! Hence the Mighty Tree shall spring, The Glory of the grove, of every tree the King! CHORUS of Priests. To the center, shall reach the vast Depth of his Root! To the stars, the vast Height of his Summit shall shoot! Thro' the world, the vast Length of his Boughs shall extend! For their food, on His Fruit, shall all nations depend! GRAND CHORUS Hail Mother of Approaching Grace! Hail Parent of the Promised Race! Far distant I see Him!—The young and the old Rush to meet the MESSIAH, by prophets foretold! The Lame, with a bound, Lightly leap from the ground; The Deaf run to hear, and the Blind to behold— And the Dead rise triumphant around! PROLOGUE TO THE EARL OF ESSEX, A TRAGEDY. This night, to your free censure, are exposed Scenes, now, almost two hundred winters, closed: Scenes, yet, that ought to be for ever near, To Freedom sacred, and to Virtue dear! Deep is the spring, whose stream this night we draw; Its source is Truth—'tis Liberty made Law: A draught divine to ev'ry generous breast; The cordial of the Wretched—of the Blest! The juice, by which the strength of souls is fed; Without whose aliment, who lives—is dead. If aught is honest, noble, kind, or great, Which yet may give some British hearts to beat; If aught has been by mighty fathers won, Which yet descends to animate a son; However weak the warmth, or dim the beam, We shew from whence the distant glory came; And lead you backward, by the kindred ray, To the full blaze of Britain's brightest day— Elizabeth!—a light till then unknown, The virgin sun, of Truth's meridian, shone, And in the Subject's Freedom fix'd a Living Throne. Is there, to whom one Privilege is sure, Who holds fair Property, as yet, secure?— Is there, to whom Religion stands endear'd, So hardly rescued, so divinely clear'd?— Is there, who claims, who feels, who prizes aught, For which the Hero bled, the Patriot wrought?— Elizabeth, as one inspiring soul, Reform'd, connected, and affirm'd the whole; And sent the blessings down, thro' ev'ry reign, For you to clasp, to cherish, and retain! Like Cynthia, peerless queen, supremely crown'd, Her guardian constellations blazed around— Selected chiefs, for council, as for fight; Her men of wisdom, and her men of might; Whose acts, illustrating our annals, stand The grace, the good, the glory of the land! For then no Courtly Faction stood confest— Who serv'd his Country, serv'd his Queen the best! If yet, among those godlike men of old, Some taint of earth lay mingled with the mould; On human frailty if misfortune grew, And sufferings, such as all who read must rue— Thro' time descending let the sorrow flow, And you who share the virtue, share the woe! PROLOGUE TO THE EARL OF WESTMORLAND, A TRAGEDY. Charm'd to this spot, concurring to this night, Wide nations close, and centuries unite. Scenes long erased, past ages rise to view, Realms change their place, and Time returns—for you! The merchant venturous in his search of gain, Who ploughs the winter of the boist'rous main, From various climes collects a various store, And lands the treasure on his native shore. Our merchant yet imports no golden prize, What wretches covet, and what you despise! A different store his richer freight imparts— The gem of virtue, and the gold of hearts; The social sense, the feelings of mankind, And the large treasure of a godlike mind! When Westmorland, unhappy, brave, and great, Appears conflicting with the pow'rs of fate, Guilty yet good, deserving yet forlorn, And by the strife of warring passions torn— Altho' our author brings the distant woe, From eyes that wept a thousand years ago, He claims your kindred tears for the distrest, Nor thinks one virtue foreign to your breast! But when the bright Rowena shall appear, First of her sex—except her rivals here— No more let Man assert his lordly claim, No more presume to step the first for fame; But to the Fair their native rights allow, Look round, and with becoming homage bow! ANOTHER PROLOGUE TO THE EARL OF WESTMORLAND. There was a time, these polish'd times preceding, Ere our good sires of Britain—knew Fine Breeding; Ere Honesty was elbow'd from the nation, Or Life's Learn'd Lie entitled “Education.” Bold Nature, then, disdain'd the mask of Art; Man, on his open aspect, wore his heart. Passion, then, knew, nor cover, nor controul; Each action spoke the dictate of the soul: Worth claim'd its triumphs, Guilt confest its stings, And Truth was known at Courts—and told to Kings! Such were your sires, humanely, nobly rude; And such the good old times, for you renew'd! From the still regions of enduring night, Our author calls the dead to life and light. He bids your hearts to heave, your eyes to flow, O'er griefs that past nine hundred years ago: Bids Truth in Person tread Hibernia's stage, And Action preach her sermon to the age; The sermon to which Nature sets her seal— For none can doubt the doctrine that they feel. Sweet as a field that vernal breezes fan, Sweet are emotions in the heart of man; Sweet are the tears of worth, the ties of kin, And all the home-bred charities within! When human feelings the warm breast inspire, When pity softens, and when passions fire; Then glows the Mint of Nature, apt, refined, And Virtue strikes her image on the mind. If the distinguish'd hero of this night, Is urged to leap the sacred mound of right; If wildly tost on passion's stormy wave, He wrecks the country he was born to save; Know it is man's to err—and let that move, To pity frailties that you can't approve. But when you see Rowena greatly soar, A height that Virtue never dared before; A summit, to aspiring man unknown, And first, and last, atchiev'd by Her alone; Then turn, and in her sex the Saint revere— Then bend, with reverence, to the Chaste and Fair! EPILOGUE TO THE PLAY OF WHAT WE MUST ALL COME TO. What all must come to!—what?—debate and strife! Must all wed plague and broils—who wed a wife? If that's the sage conclusion of our poet, The man's a fool—you happy Husbands know it! Your Dames are form'd upon a gentler plan— To sooth and smooth the rough hewn mass of man; To bid the tumult of your souls to cease, And smile your warring passions into peace. Like Rome's famed matrons, scorning all excess In masque or mummery, in dance or dress, Your Wives are busied in the nobler cares Of planting their own virtues in your heirs, And scarce depart their house—except to prayers! They neither take nor give the world a handle For tittle-tattle, gossipping, or scandal; And, as for that strange vice of gaming—lard! I dare be sworn, they scarce can tell a card. In times of yore, indeed, when 'twas the fashion, And drums, routs, rackets, cards, the favourite passion; With ev'ry Husband, gambling was the flame, And even their precious Spouses—play'd the game. Plumb, in the reigning vice, your Statesmen jump; And Factions, in rotation, turn'd up trump: Honours, on all hands, they agree to wave; Some play'd the fool, who meant to play the Knave. The Vizier, vers'd in all the gambling trade, The Court against his simpler Country play'd; But, dubious of the pow'rs that might withstand, He wisely kept the impending King in hand— The People thought the advantage somewhat hard; But deem'd their Magna Charta a sure card! Now, heats, and betts, all terms of truce confound; Craft, perjury, prostitution, wait around; While, high o'er head, Astrea's beam, behold, Weighing light conscience against pond'rous gold. But how the game did end, or may end—why— Time, if it chuse, may tell—in sooth, not I. Ye Fair, intended, by the powers above, With silken chains, to bind the world in Love; On whose soft sway, to earth's extremest end, The race, the brotherhood of man depend! O, never, never answer rage with rage, But shun the tempest which you can't assuage; Your Tyrants, then, shall spend their wrath in vain, Return, quite tame, and reassume their chain; So shall Submission win despotic sway, And the World's Lord shall willingly obey! TO THE MEMORY OF Lieutenant Colonel HENRY CLEMENTS. Shall boastful pomp, the high imperial name, Or title, only, swell the trump of Fame? To equal Worth be equal Glory due, And wreaths that bloom'd for Clayton bloom for you! O, once endowed with ev'ry pleasing pow'r, To chear the sad, or charm the social hour; To sweeten life with many a gentle art, And win the whole dominion of the heart; I deem'd, far other than the fates allow, The laurels bound upon your living brow, To greet my friend returning from his toil, Graced with his deeds, and laden with his spoil. Too fond of what the martial harvests yield, Alas, too forward to the dangerous field, As one of old renown in battle tried, The glory of the dusty plain you died! The tongues of Dettingen your triumph tell, And weeping Tournay points where Clements fell. O, in some future day of loud alarms, When Virtue and my Country call to arms For Freedom—struggling nations to unbind, And snap the sceptres that would bruise mankind— At such an hour, in such a cause as thine, The honour'd close of such a death be mine! Then may some kindred Bard appoint my grave, Snatch forth my name and roll it with the brave; Assign my pen and sword the wish'd applause, And say that both were drawn in Virtue's cause! Then drop the salutation given to you— “Companion, Countryman, and Friend—adieu!” A CHARACTER. When, o'er the canvas, flows the master's line, He adds no name to mark the just design; The portrait, 'midst a mingling world, is known, And stands admired, distinguish'd, and alone! Behold him, full of virtues as of days, Laden with worth, infirmities, and praise! Down the hoar flowings of his silver'd head, Wisdom and Time their equal honours shed; Truth and Benevolence, with equal grace, Rise from his breast, and lighten in his face. His languid limbs expect the peaceful bier; His head and heart still active, free, and clear! On his own frame, though dire distemper preys, He's borne around, to give all others ease; Before his healing presence Life respires, And Sickness, with his rueful train, retires! Great Leach both of our persons and our state! When thou, at some sad hour, shalt yield to fate— O then, adieu Hibernia's chiefest wealth; Adieu to Liberty! adieu to Health! TO Mr. B? ON Advertising his “Treatise on the Interests of Ireland.” I Say, B?, what dæmon has possess'd A brain, that better should discern, Than thus to chuse a theme, confess'd No creature's study, or concern? II Hadst thou but writ of Mat the Miller, Or frolicks of the Fairy-tribe, Or, even, of John the Giant Killer; There's not a soul but would subscribe. III But, here, though from a Seraph's wing Thy manna-dropping quill were shed; Morpheus his leaden mace shall bring, Or ere the second page be read. THE PATRIOTISM OF IRELAND, AN HISTORICAL BALLAD. To the Tune of “Ye Commons and Peers.’ I In the year, do you see, Of fifty and three, A year of facetious renown; A conjurer came, Old R?r by name, For the pastime of country and town! II At once to surprize And cozen our eyes, He shew'd us of Courtiers ten brace; All Courtiers, as true To the Minister's Cue, As ever took Pension or Place! III But R?r, anon, Cries, “Pass and be gone!” The coast it is instantly clear; And straight, in the place Of Prostitutes base, Ten Brace of good Patriots appear! IV The rabble and rout Clap, caper, and shout; The multitude see and believe: They hail, with acclaim, Each Patriot Name! But the Knowing-ones laugh in their sleeve. V For R?r, once more Our wits to restore, Repeats his charm backwards—and then, On this Patriot-Host, He throws Powder of Post, And he shews them all Rascals again! THE QUESTION. INSCRIBED TO LADY CAROLINE RUSSELL. I From our frail sire, who first knew sin, Thro' every stage of age and youth, The World's Grand Question still hath been, “Whence is Beauty, what is Truth?” II This to resolve, or to inquire, Employed The Learn'd of every age; Alike perplex'd the Son and Sire, The Dull, the Subtle, and the Sage. III At length, impatient of delay, The World agreed no more to wait; But cast disputed Truth away, As well from Practice, as Debate. IV Then Beauty, on unrivall'd ground, Sole cause of contest, stood alone; And every Knight hath form'd, or found, A favourite Princess of his own. V To Magic Numbers, one confines The Castle, where The Charmer dwells; And one, to Corresponding Lines Of Angles, Cubes, and Parallels. VI By sounds of soft attraction led, Her Power the Man of Music feels: The Scholar dreams She's in his Head; The Dancer swears She's in his Heels. VII In Pleasure some, and some in State, Their cloud-composed Enchantress spy; And, from Ambition's towery height, She catches many a wishful eye. VIII In Symmetry, Discerners view A Glance of Beauty's Real Queen; And nearer, by a Chosen Few, The Sentimental Fair is seen. IX But each, like Knights of old emprize, (Whate'er his present flame) requires, That All should find conforming eyes, And join to bow—where he admires. X To fix this Fire of wandering Love, Supernal Power resolv'd to shew, That what was Truth in Heaven above, Alone made Beauty here below. XI For this, He purposed to condense What Angels felt of Good or Bright, With Sentiment to strike the Sense, And give the Charm of Soul to Sight. XII At length The Plastic Power descends With Heaven's Select Ingredients fraught: To earth his beamy flight He bends, And into Substance features Thought. XIII From Zembla's frozen clime, He chose A quantity of Virgin-air, For Lucid Organs, to compose The Moving Fabric of his Fair. XIV With this He blends the Portion due, Nine Solar Rays of Morning Light, To give a Blush of chastest hue, As deep and warm, as pure and bright. XV From Hybla's sweets, that breathe in fame, He press'd the Prime of Bloom and Bud; And, through the soft transparent frame, He pour'd The Aromatic Flood. XVI Sphered in the Center, as a Sun, Within He hung The Cordial Freight, Which from Eternal Truth He won, And bid The embosom'd Heaven to beat. XVII From Number, Music, Sisters twin, He caught the Magic of the Face; And, from the Sentiment within, He pictured Motion, Mien, and Grace. XVIII Thus folding, in One Radiant Frame, Each Beauty Humanely-Divine, He gave His System up to Fame, And Mortals call her—CAROLINE! THE FOX-CHASE. Young Marcus with the lark salutes the morn— “Saddle your horses; huntsman, wind your horn.” We start, we rise at the enlivening sound— The woods all ring—and wind the horn around: We snatch a short repast within the hall; “To horse! To horse!”—We issue at the call. As when, to rid his country from alarms Of Russian inroads, and of Gallic arms, Great Prussia bids the patriot trump to blow, The free-born gather, and around him glow: So, at the call of Marcus—grateful sound— Men, steeds, and dogs, tumultuous pour around. The youth upon their coursers vault with grace; The coursers neigh, impatient for the chase: Their short and eager steps the bit restrains; They paw and pant, reluctant to the reins. Unfolding gates a spacious passage yield— Forward we move, and issue to the field. Far within cover thoughtless Reynard lay, And slept the riots of the night away. Late, from the ravage of a neighbouring farm, He had withdrawn, impenitent of harm; The tainted gales his felon steps pursue, And tell his travels to the conscious dew. But he, whom many a 'scape had render'd sure, For slights and wiles unrivall'd, slept secure, In unsuspecting spirits blithe and bland, Nor dreams the dreadful reck'ning is at hand. Trueman, whom for sagacious nose we hail The Chief, first touch'd the scarce-distinguish'd gale; His tongue was doubtful, and no hound replies: “Haux!—Wind him!—Haux!”—the tuneful huntsman cries. At once the list'ning pack asunder spread, With tail erect, and with inquiring head: With busy nostrils they foretaste their prey, And snuff the lawn-impearling dews away. Now here, now there, they chop upon the scent, Their tongues in undulating æther spent: More joyous now, and louder by degrees, Warm, and more warm, they catch the coming breeze. Now with full symphony they jointly hail The welcome tidings of a surer gale; Along the vale they pour the swelling note; Their ears and dewlaps on the morning float. How vainly Art aspires, by rival sounds, To match the native melody of Hounds! Not eunuchs warbling in the vocal choir, Tho' join'd by pipe and string, such bliss inspire, When with joint sense they quaff the tainted gale, And in full concert ring their morning peal: The list'ning planets from their orbits bend, And the still elements with joy attend. Again the doubtful scent our hope defeats: “To cover—hark!”—the huntsman's voice repeats. Wide on the left a neighbouring copse was spread, And thither the obsequious pack he led. But more aloof the parting sportsmen scout, Watch every path, and skirt the wood about. The huntsman now, with expectation flush, “Haux, Fox!” he cries, and strikes the hopeful bush: To cover strait the spreading hounds now take, Snuff every tuft, and spy in every brake. Again the breeze betrays the tainted ground, And Lovely tells the gladsome tidings round; “Hark!—Lovely!—hark!”—deep echoing glens resound. Ah, hapless foxes! ever blind to fate! Without a cause dejected and elate. Darkling ye walk, unconscious of your end, Nor mark the gathering mischiefs that impend! The shrewd and simple share an equal lot— In death the wizard finds himself a sot. That luckless morn, when first along the glade The tell-tale dews his nightly steps betray'd, Wrap'd in soft slumbers Reynard press'd his bed, And there on visionary poultry fed. He dream'd, as by a neighbouring grange he crept, Couch'd while he mov'd, and linger'd as he stept, Two virgin pullets fix'd his side regard, Plump from the sounding barn and pamp'ring yard: Near, and more near, he steals with winking eyes, Then springs at once, and seizes on his prize. Loud piercing screams th' affrighted welkin fill, And down his jaws the luscious streams distil. Ev'n in this rapturous moment, while his taste Gorg'd the full riot of a fancied feast, Lovely's near note, far echoing, pierc'd his ears— He wakes, and inward shrinks to shun his fears. Upward he starts—erects his ears—and then Hears the loud “Hark!”—and down he sinks again. Trembling he strives to re-assure his heart With a fresh promise of long prospering art; Then with sly caution, crouching as he rose, From his warm kennel's ancient seat he goes; The seat to which he shall return no more, Now with chill moss and dropping branches hoar. Thro' frizzled thickets, and thro' yielding sprays, He thwarts each path, and treads a puzzling maze. So steer'd, some devious vessel shifts her sail, And, veering, gains upon the adverse gale. Now, from the mansion of his late repose Rank steams and reeking exhalations rose; The tepid vapours are diffus'd around, And reach the nerves of each inquiring hound: With answering notes, their heads tow'rds Heav'n they cast, And in full concert hail the rich repast. The sculking caitiff, who beneath the spread Of fav'ring umbrage veil'd his luckless head, Close at his ear believes the distant peals, And a whole host of dæmons at his heels. His instant terrors cast all wiles away, He breaks from cover, and demands the day: O'er the fair field he flies his num'rous foes, And down the wind, as swift as wind he goes. A watchful scout his bold elopement spies— “Ho!—tally-ho!”—triumphantly he cries. His rash alarm the gen'rous Marcus blames— “Law!—give him law!”—as loudly he exclaims. The distant sportsmen gather at the shout, As bees they buzz and 'close their chief about; The fervid youth attending crowd the plain, And bind the crested coursers to the rein. The choiring hounds, with deep harmonious throats, Fill the charm'd wood, and swell the doubling notes; Sweeter than those of that enchanting strain That still'd the surge on the Trinacrian main, When to the mast, the Grecian, wisely bound, Scarce dar'd the tempting magic of the sound. The dogs a travers'd labyrinth unwind, Subtler than that which Dædalus design'd. By slow degrees the doubling wile is won, Trac'd through the shade, and push'd into the sun; There the broad airs a livelier scent assume, And greet their senses with a full perfume. Then, as a shaft from the withholding thong, They shoot away, and pour the plains along. No more the youth their eager steeds restrain; Ardent they start, and loose the granted rein: The steeds spring forth, and from the rein unbound, Devour the lessening distance of the ground; They stretch and strain each nerve and active limb, Sweep down the slopes, and o'er the levels skim. Their force a generous emulation fires; Beneath our speed the fleeting earth retires. In a glad frenzy we attempt the sky; Nor seem to run, or ride, but mount and fly! Now lightly o'er opposing walls we bound, Clear the broad trench and top the rising mound: No stop, no time for respite or recess; On, and still on, fox, dogs, and horses press. The hounds outbreath'd from their late tuneful throat, Now break—half short—the disappointed note. Now o'er the smoaking vale each gen'rous steed Relaxes from the fervour of his speed: Push'd up the bray, indignantly they feel The clanking lash and the retorted steel; Then down the steep with quick'ning rapture go, And stretch and sweat upon the plain below. Athwart one way a tumbling stream was laid That to the lake its daily tribute paid: Here the first stop our rapid course delays, And with a grateful interruption stays. Upon the bank, in watchful silence still, We breathe the rising freshness of the rill; We pant—we drop our languid limbs—and all, Like fainting Cephalus, on Aura call. Dark as a mist that to the distant view Caps the brown mountains with a murky blue; So from our steeds the thick'ning vapours rise, Enfold their riders and obscure the skies. The glowing dogs, forgetful of their foe, Full on the stream their headlong bodies throw, Like iron on the whizzing smithy flung, And lap, and pant, and loll the length'ning tongue. Now, from the west, a livelier gale upsprings, And with new nerves each listless member strings. In terms still varying their harmonious sounds, The huntsman calls, and chears his circling hounds. Now up, now down, now 'cross the stream he beats— “Haux!—wind him!—haux!—Fox, find him!” he repeats. Now round and round a fruitless search he plies, And now a tour of wider circuit tries. But no intelligence rewards his care; No note confess'd the fox was ever there— As though some opening gulph had gorg'd our prey, Or sudden power had snatch'd him quite away. But Reynard, hotly push'd, and close pursu'd, Yet fruitful in expedients to elude, When to the bourn's refreshing bank he came, Had plung'd, all reeking, in the friendly stream. The folding waves his failing pow'rs restore, And close the gates of every fuming pore. Then down the channel, over flats and steeps, He steals, and trots—or wades, or swims, or creeps; Till, where the pebbled shores the surges break, He quits his feet, and launches on the lake. As when some coasting skiff, with shatter'd geers, A cautious course 'twixt land and ocean steers, Fearful alike on either dang'rous hand To trust the boist'rous sea or faithless land: Possess'd of equal fears and equal lore, So Reynard coasts aloof, and shuns the shore, Lest the uncover'd odour should exhale, And tell sure tidings to the trait'rous gale. Not distant far, upon the beach there stood The hoary growth of a majestic wood, Whose age of oak and intervening yew Not the great-grandsires of the living knew: The flooring, deep beneath the distant shade, With thorn and frizzling brush was thick inlaid, While clamouring rooks, scarce heard above our head, Amid the cloud-commingling branches bred. Here Reynard lands, all dripping from the lake, And seeks the shelter of his wonted brake. Arriv'd, he shakes, and rolls, and turns him round; Then entering, sinks o'ertoil'd upon the ground: Stretch'd at full length, secure of care he lies, And instant slumbers seal his willing eyes. The chop-fall'n hounds meantime are heard no more, But silent range along the winding shore. Hopeless alike the hunters lag behind, And give all thoughts of Reynard to the wind— All, save one wily rival of his art, Who vows unpitying vengeance e'er they part. Along the coast his watchful course he bent, Careful to catch and wind the thwarting scent; And last, to make his boastful promise good, Enter'd the precincts of the fatal wood. There, thro' the gloom, he leads one hopeless train, And cheers the long desponding pack in vain; Till Ringwood first the faint effluvia caught, And with loud tongue reform'd their old default. Rous'd at the swell of that reviving sound, Our hopes rekindle, and our hearts rebound! Eager we spread thro' furze and mingling brush, And lash the woof of each afflicted bush; While here and there the busy dogs reveal The languid tidings of the dubious gale. Meanwhile the fox, unconscious of the chase, Repair'd his late fatigues, and slept in peace; Nor mark'd the cry of many a hostile tongue That through the copious forest loudly rung, Till a bold youth approach'd his thoughtless bed, And struck the bower that trembl'd o'er his head. As when amaz'd upstarted Manoah's heir, Shorn of his strength and his enchanted hair, While his peal'd ears receiv'd the hostile sound Of shouting foes that girt his couch around; So Reynard wakes with sudden horrors chill, Scant of his force, and shorten'd of his skill. Bold thro' despair, he breaks at once away, Bounds thro' the brush, and rushes into day! The fields, the shores, the hills, each wood resounds With echoing hunters, and with op'ning hounds: Rocks, waters, undulating air, and sky, Become one peal, and propagate the cry. From the firm land, and from the trembling lake, Full on our ears the tuneful thunders break, Roll o'er the waves, and strike the distant coast, And far beyond, 'mid heav'n-top'd hills, are lost. Again we start, we bound, we stretch amain, O'er the brown heath and o'er the bright champaign: Again o'er gates we fly, thro' hedges rush, Thro' moorlands labour, and thro' thickets push. Intense again our gath'ring fervour grows— Again the coursers smoak—the rider glows: Distinguish'd steeds their fellow steeds outwind, And leave their late associates far behind; While laggard hounds, that form a lengthen'd train, Run, hoarse, and mute, and panting, o'er the plain. O'erbreath'd we come where, 'twixt impending hills, Ran the joint current of two gurgling rills; On either hand, adown each fearful steep, Hung forth the shaggy horrors, dark and deep: Here, thro' brown umbrage, glow'd the vivid green, And headlong slopes, and winding paths between; Growth above many a growth, tall trees arose, The tops of these scarce veil'd the roots of those; A winding court where wandering fancy walk'd And to herself responsive Echo talk'd. Here, stay'd again, we hail the kind delay, And down the shadowy paths delighted stray; The gathering pack unite, and enter in, Then spread, and pierce the darkness of the glen. Now here, now there, now sole, and now combin'd, They catch the wand'ring odour from the wind; Thro' many a traverse many-twirling maze, And all the wond'rous wisdom of his ways, The Fox they trace, unrav'ling as they go, Discreetly sure, and musically slow; Now in joint harmony they pour their notes, And Echo answers from ten thousand throats. From hill to hill, with replicated sounds, The peal rolls down the glen, and still rebounds, Packs beyond packs seem sweetly to reply, And waft to distant climes the lessening cry. At length, from path to path, and glade to glade, 'Midst woven thickets and impending shade, Thro' the steep wilderness their way they won, And reach'd the shelve that open'd to the sun: Then up the slope they speed them, swift as wind, As swift the hunters press, and shout behind. But now no more our coursers pull the rein O'er the firm greensward, or expanded plain, Thro' rude and craggy grounds, thro' miry clay, We urge with peril our o'erlabour'd way. Cast, here and there, along the dangerous course, Lies spread the rider, and the floundering horse; But onward still the foremost press, nor mind To ask for luckless friends that limp behind. At last the bottom of a mount we reach'd, Whose top from sea to sea its prospect stretch'd, And seem'd a look of stately scorn to throw On the proud works of little men below. With half a pack, and scarcely half a train, We dare all dangers, and all toil disdain; The dogs near faint, yet still on slaughter bent, With tongues abrupt avow the burning scent; The pendant cliffs audaciously essay, And trot, or crawl, or climb their desperate way. While, slanting, we avoid the headlong deep, Yet bend, press on, and labour up the steep. Where the brow beetling from the mountain sprung With stunted thorn and shaggy rocks o'erhung, Beneath whose base a sanded bench, with shade Of furze and tangling thicket was o'erlaid, Reynard his palace kept, his regal seat, His fort of sure resource and last retreat; The rest were but the mansions of a night, For casual respite, or for fresh delight. Here a Vulcanian Cacus erst was said To hale the carcases whose blood he shed; Or as in rolls of old romance we read Of ravening giants, an enormous breed, With grizly bones who hung their spacious bower, Dire trophies of their cruelty and power: So bones and blood did Reynard's hall distain, And whitening skeletons confess'd the slain; Hens, leverets, lambs,—sad trophies of his art, His raging appetite and ruthless heart. To this dread fort, with many a hard essay, We win with peril our o'er-labour'd way; At length our journey, not our work is done, The way indeed, but not the fort is won. Here had the felon earth'd;—with many a hound And many a horse we gird his hold around: The hounds 'fore heaven their accusation spread, And cry for justice on his caitiff head. Meanwhile, with cutlasses, we clear each bush Of platted black-thorn, and of stubborn brush, Remove the covert of befriending night, And on the cavern's entrance pour the light.— Aghast, and trembling in the burst of day, With haggard eyes the shrinking savage lay; In vain he glares his desperate glance around, No scape—no stratagem—no hope is found! He dies!—he dies! the echoing hills reply, And the loud triumph rends the vaulted sky. REDEMPTION: A POEM. It comes; the wish'd, the long expected morn— “Thou Son of Man, thou Son of GOD, be born!” Lo, He descends, and bows the yielding skies; To meet Him, the exulting valleys rise: Death shrinks and trembles, fearing to be slain; And all Hell quakes throughout its deep domain. Yet comes He not, array'd in worldly show, Nor in the weakness of man's power below: In human flesh, his Godhead He conceals; In human form, Immensity He veils: Eternal, He assumes a mortal frame; And, in subjection, lo, the world's SUPREME! 'Tis come; the day of health, the saving morn— The Son of GOD, The Babe of Love is born! Behold, All Heaven descends upon the wing, And choiring angels “Glory, glory!” sing; “Glory to GOD, from Whom such bounties flow! “And Peace on earth, Good-will to man below!” “Tidings we bring, glad tidings of Free Grace, “Tidings of Joy to All of human race! “The promised day is come, the great event— “To you A Child is born, A Son is sent; “A Saviour, Christ, The Lowly, The Supreme, “Gracious to pardon, mighty to redeem! “Within his hand the nations shall be weigh'd, “The world upon his infant-shoulder laid. “His name is Wonderful; He shall be stiled “The God of Power, the All-embracing Child; “The imbosom'd sun, whose Inward Beam imparts “Wisdom to souls, The Counsellor of hearts, “Whose days nor know commencement nor encrease; “The Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace! “Your Saving GOD, in Bethlehem, ye shall find, “Swathed in a crib, on humbling straw reclined; “He, who all things unites and comprehends, “To stable with his lowliest brutes descends. “Your songs, your songs, ye Morning Stars employ; “And, all ye Sons of Glory, shout for joy!” Approaching Seraphim The Babe surround, And, with adoring reverence, bow profound; Amazed to see their Infinite confined, The Ancient of all Days in infancy inshrined. With wondering eye, they pierce his filmy skin And lucid flesh, when, lo, A Heaven within, Wide as the round where yonder planets roll, Though stretch'd to infinite from either pole; Love, to whose depth no measure can descend; And Bliss, encircling blessings, without end. See the dear, little, helpless, mighty Hands, So meekly yielded to maternal bands! 'Tis theirs the powers of darkness to repel, To crush the pride of earth, and wrath of hell; To lift the fallen, to prop the feeble knee, To set the prisoners of his Israel free; To burst the iron gates of sin and pain, To number time and death among the slain; Captive to lead captivity on high, Follow'd by blood-bought myriads through the sky; His Kingdom in Eternal Peace to found, And beam forth blessings without end or bound. Ye sophists, who, with scientific lore, Nature's recluse arcana would explore; Who, in your dreams of fancy, mould and wield The mazy worlds of yon empyreal field, And boast to have retraced, by reason's force, The unmeasured chain of sequels to their source; Come forward with your length and depth of thought, And see all human learning set at nought: Here, try to mete, to compass, to define, And plumb your GOD with your five-fathom'd line! Ye mighty too, beneath whose tyrant brow Pale vassals shake, and servile nations bow, Perish your pride! and let your glories fade! Lo, Nature's Monarch in a manger laid! Behold, The Word, at whose creative might The heavens and earth sprung forth to form and light, In Love descends, unutterably mild, And smiles the World's Salvation—in a Child! No clarions, yet, proclaim Him King of Kings; No ensigns speak him the Supreme of things: Humbly he lays his purple robe aside, Until, for man, it shall in Blood be dyed; Nor shall the Crown his Regal Brow adorn, Till his Love twist it of the pointed thorn! Ah, Father, Author, GOD of Boundless Grace! What, what is man, with all his recreant race, That they with Thine own Jesus should be weighed; And, for their ransom, Such a Price be paid? 'Tis true, that man from his Creator came All-bright, as from the sun his effluent beam; Lord of these heavens and earth, the seas that flow, The lands that germinate, and stars that glow. Lovely without, and glorious all within, He knew no sorrow, for he knew no sin: His will was with The Father's Will inform'd; His love was with The Love of Jesus warm'd; The Eternal Light, that lights the solar ray, Shed forth the Peace of his Diviner Day; He felt the bliss of the SUPREMELY BLEST, And GOD's Own Heaven was open'd in his breast. But ah! he yet was frail, nor understood There's but One Will, All-just, All-wise, All-good; The Will, throughout the universe, who knows, Alone, to Make, to Fit, and to Dispose. The wretch, who dares a different will to frame, Brings war into the works of Heaven's Supreme; Of power would even Omnipotence defraud, And blasts his being in the Will of GOD. Hence, man, so great, so glorious, and so good, Was tempted from the tower in which he stood. Lured by external baits of sensual taste, He wish'd to gratify, he long'd to feast; The good of his subjected world to know; Distinct from GOD, to win a Heaven below; To found a new dominion of his own, And reign sufficient to himself alone. “Ingrate—O stop thee on the headlong brink! “Ere thou dost take the fearful venture,—think! “Think, from The GOD thou wishest to forego, “All that thou art, thy bliss and being flow; “And, can the creatures yield thee, should they list, “More than The Source where thou and they exist? “Of thy Creator if thou art bereft, “Think, to Redeem, no other GOD is left!” He listens not,—the infernal powers impel: He long'd, he pluck'd, he tasted—and he fell. O, what a Fall! a steep from high to low! Extremes of bliss, to what extremes of woe! Plumb, from his Heaven, this Second Angel fell Down his own depth, his God-abandon'd hell: Horror of horrors! darkness and despair! He look'd for comfort—but no gleam was there. O Love, Love, Love! stupendous, wide, and steep! High o'er all heights, below damnation deep! In vain the desperate rebel would essay, From Thee to tear his being, far away; Thy Saving Hand arrests his prone career; For, to Thy Presence, every place is—here! For him Thou hadst prepared a mediate seat, Meet for his taste, and fitting to his state; A seat of fleshly organs, gross and frail, To dissolution doom'd, and form'd to fail. He wakes to a new world, and, with new eyes, Sees unknown elements, and unknown skies; The husk and surface of that blest abode, Where late he dwelt, internal, with his GOD. He turns his eyes upon his carnal frame, And sees it, all, a seat of filth and shame; Fellow'd with brutes, with brutes to take his bed, Like brutes to propagate, be born, and fed: But different, far, the table and the treat; Earth is their heaven, their home, and native seat: For brutes, unearn'd, the ready banquet lies, Apt to their taste, and obvious to their eyes; But man must wring it from a grudging soil, And win scant sustenance with sweat and toil. He looks abroad, and sees the new-dropt fawn Cloathed without care, and frisking on the lawn; But finds his own new carcass bleak and bare, And shivering in a strange and hostile air. Yet know, O man, that all which can betide From hard-fang'd avarice, or o'erbearing pride, That art can compass from the flood or field, All that these four-fold elements can yield, Is barely to afford thee warmth and bread, Like fellow brutes to be array'd and fed; But ah, all, all, incapable, as wind, To yield one morsel to the famish'd mind! This the wretch finds (beguiled by devilish fraud) The sum of all, for which he left his GOD; The sum of all the good—he yet was blind To half the evils that came close behind. Late, lord of land and water, air and flame, He wielded, at his will, their cumbrous frame; Could pierce earth's dark and various entrails, through; Could call forth all their wonders to his view; Through minim forms the internal maze could trace, And lift the broad-back'd mountains from their base. To him, of every foliage, flower, and blade, The fabric, use, and beauty, lay display'd; Of living specks he pierced the fine machine, And open'd to himself the world within; Saw all with glory, as with skill, replete, And traced the Artist to his inmost seat. But now, fallen, fallen from his imperial tower, 'Reft of his glory, emptied of his power; Degraded, hurl'd from his celestial steep, And sunk in flesh, a dungeon dark and deep; (Distance immense in nature, not in space, But wider, wider far, than place from place!) The insulting elements their lord controul, And cast their four-fold fetters round his soul. Dethroned, debased, without as from within, Enslaved by matter, since enslaved by sin, Corruption to its kindred mass lays claim, And, entering, seizes his devoted frame. Distemper follows, with his gloomy throng, Bearing pests, stings, and fires, and racks along; Languor that saps, and rueful throwes that grind; With Death, who shakes the certain dart behind. Already, o'er the sad subjected wight, The lordly elements exert their right; And on his limbs their baneful influence cast, Parch'd in the beam, or shivering in the blast: While high, o'er head, the gathering vapours frown, And on his anguish look unpitying down; Then flash in thunders, or in tempest pour, And on his members dash the pelting shower. But worse, far worse within, black storms infest And shake the sphere of his Benighted Breast. Still, round and round, the whirling passions tend, And his sad heart with horrid conflict rend; Impatience, rage, despair, untamed desire, And hate, impregnate with infernal fire: He calls for death, and would have ruin hurl'd At Heaven, himself, the tempter, and the world. But GOD, the One Eternal Thirst to bless, Eyed his estate, and pity'd his distress. “Adam,” he said, and look'd unmeasured grace, “Adam, thou art fallen, and fallen is all thy race: “Such as the tree is, such will be the fruit; “The branch must bear the flavour of the root. “Late I was in thee Love, and Power, and Will; “My Glory did thy soul and body fill; “But, laps'd from me, thy spirit and thy frame “Sink to the principles from whence they came— “Thy soul to its own helpless fierce desire, “A rueful whirl of dark tormenting fire! “Thy body to the grossness of its birth, “Corruption to corruption, earth to earth! “If, in thy strength, thou didst not hold thy state, “How shall thy weakness reassume its seat? “How, from thy pit of flesh, so dull and deep, “Cast off the cumbrance, and ascend the steep? “For, by the road thou hast fallen, as is most just, “Through the same road, O man, return thou must; “To Strength through weakness, and to Peace through strife, “To Bliss through anguish, and through death to Life. “But this no creature, not The Seraph can; “Though once in GOD so mighty, less can man: “This, therefore, Adam, thou canst never do; “Thou in Thy GOD, then, must be Born Anew; “Born a new creature of a Seed Divine, “Reborn, O Adam, of Thy Son and Mine; “Thou the Old Father of man's fallen estate, “He the New Sire who shall regain their seat. “Foil'd by a devilish foe, thy weakness fell, “Captive to sense, and sin, and death, and hell; “In weakness, therefore, must His Strength prevail, “Though sense, and sin, and death, and hell assail; “As man, in human flesh and frailty, He “Must conquer all, O man, that conquer'd thee. “Yes, from my bosom my Beloved I give, “That my lost creatures may return, and live. “He, for your sakes, shall lay his glory by; “For you be born, and suffer, gasp, and die; “The price of guilt my Holy-One shall pay, “And tread, of death and hell, the bitterest way. “You, by His Fetters, can alone be freed; “To wash your stains, the Lamb of Love must bleed; “So shall his woe turn all your woe to weal, “His bruises medicine, and his woundings heal. “Hence man, apostate man, so deeply lost, “Shall weigh the curs'd commission, by the cost; “Shall learn, as meet, to hold himself at nought; “Shall feel he's all a folly, all a fault; “In deep Abasement lift his suppliant eyes, “In Lowliness alone be taught to rise; “In tears, in anguish, shall his Guilt deplore, “Shall call on Christ who can alone restore; “By Him supported, shall affirm his ground, “Shall struggle with the chains by which he's bound; “Disclaim, detest the world, in which he fell; “Oppose his champion'd soul to flesh and hell; “Wish his old worm, his sin, and self undone, “And catch, and cling to my All-saving Son! “This in due time. “Jesus, mean-while, shall steal, like doubtful morn, “Into the breasts of all of woman born; “There shed his Dawn of Coeternal Light, “There struggle with their length and depth of night; “A solid gloom! which He alone can melt; “Which, like Ægyptian darkness, may be felt. “His seed, in flesh, my Holy-One shall sow, “And give it strength to root, and grace to grow; “Man within man, begotten from above, “Bearing the likeness of The Son of Love; “Sons of my son, ordain'd to see my face; “All embryon heirs of glory and of grace; “But not mature to wing their native skies, “Till their New Adam shall from death arise. “Thus the new offspring shall the old put on, “Making a double manhood, two in one; “Of different principles, of different sires, “Conceptions, tastes, enjoyments, and desires: “The one, as earth, crude, grudging, grappling all “To the dark center of its craving ball; “The other, as the sun, benign and bright, “A going forth on all in life and light. “Hence, through the course of their sublunar life, “Though brother'd, they shall be at truceless strife: “What one approves, the other shall reject; “What one detests, the other shall affect. “So man, at once, shall court what he'll contemn, “Neglect yet reverence, do what he'll condemn; “At once transgress, and wish he could fulfill; “Be righteous and unrighteous, good and ill; “Bearing the witness and the seal, within, “Of new and old, the man of grace and sin, “The heart writ story of his rise and fall, “The Gospel of his freedom and his thrall. “Thy elder offspring, Adam, grown and strong, “Frequent, shall drag his younger mate along; “Like huge Leviathan, shall trust to play, “And rule at large in his congenial sea: “But mine within his jaws a barb shall place, “And check the headlong monster in his race. “The younger heir, invisibly, within, “Shall oft convict his outward mate of sin; “Reprove with judgment, and reform betimes; “Or, with a whip, call'd CONSCIENCE, lash his crimes: “So may the blest the accursed one subdue, “And the old man, at length, refine into the new! “Nor grudge I, Adam, those fallen sons of thine, “Flesh of thy flesh, to share a seat with mine, “By Him sublimed into a nobler sphere; “So they slay not their younger brothers, here. “But, through much grief, this Glory must be won; “Flesh, soil'd by sin, by Death must be undone; “Must drop the world, wherein it felt its force, “And, giant-like, rejoiced to run its course; “Must drop each organ of its late delight; “Must bid a long adieu to sense and sight, “A long adieu to every darling lust; “Must yield its passive members, dust to dust, “Within the potter's furnace to be fined, “And leave its grossness, with its guilt, behind. “Meanspace, those forms of flesh, those sons of sin, “Shall serve to hold my Priceless Pearls within; “As golden grain within prolific clay, “To shoot and ripen toward a future day. “Yon maggot, vilest offspring of vile earth, “Answers the genial baseness of his birth: “Lo, where he rolls and battens, with delight, “In filth, to smell offensive, foul to sight! “Well pleased, he drinks the stench, the dirt devours, “And prides him in the puddle of his powers; “Careless, unconscious of the beauteous guest, “The Internal Speck committed to his breast. “Yet, in his breast, The Internal Speck grows warm, “And quickens into motion, life, and form; “Far other form than that its fosterer bore, “High o'er its parent-worm ordain'd to soar: “The son, still growing as the sire decays, “In radiant plumes his infant shape arrays; “Matures, as in a soft and silent womb, “Then, opening, peeps from his paternal tomb; “Now, struggling, breaks at once into the day, “Tries his young limbs, and bids his wings display, “Expands his lineaments, erects his face, “Rises sublime o'er all the reptile race; “From dew-dropt blossoms sips the nectared stream, “And basks within the glory of the beam. “Thus, to a sensual, to a sinful shrine, “The SAVIOUR shall entrust His Speck Divine; “In secret animate His Chosen Seed, “Fill with His Love, and with His Substance feed; “Inform it with sensations of His Own, “And give it appetites to flesh unknown: “So shall the lusts of man's old worm give place, “His fervour languish, and his force decrease; “Till spoil'd of every object, gross or vain, “His pride and passions humbled, crush'd, and slain; “From a false world to his First Kingdom won, “His will, and sin, and sense, and self, undone; “His Inward Man from death shall break away, “And soar, and mingle with Eternal Day!” This (in a word) The Father spoke—and streight The Son descended from above all height. Upon the chaos of man's world he came, And pierc'd the darkness with His Living Beam; Then cast a rein on the reluctant will, And bid the tempest of the soul be still. The good from evil He did then divide, And set man's darkness from GOD's Light aside: Wide, from the heart, he bids His Will be done, And there placed Conscience as a central sun; Whence Reason, like the moon, derives, by night, A weak, a borrow'd, and a dubious light. But, down the soul's abyss, a region dire! He caus'd the Stygian horrors to retire; From whence ascends the gloom of many a pest, Darkening the Beam of Heaven within the breast; Atrocious intimations, causeless care, Distrust, and hate, and rancour, and despair. As in creation, when The Word gave birth To every offspring of the teeming earth, He now conceiv'd high fruits of happier use, And bid the heart and head of man produce: Then branch'd the pregnant will, and went abroad In all the sweets of its Internal GOD; In every mode of Love, a fragrant throng, Bearing the Heart-sent Charities along; Divine Effusions of the human breast, Within the very act of blessing, blest; Desires that press another's weight to bear, To soothe their anguish, to partake their care; Pains that can please, and griefs that joys excite; Bruises that balm, and tears that drop delight. GOD saw the Seed was Precious; and began To bless His Own Redeeming Work, in man. Nor less, the pregnant region of the mind Brought forth conceptions suited to its kind; Faint emblems, yet of virtue to proclaim That Parent-Spirit, whence our spirits came; Spirits that, like their GOD, with mimic skill, Produce new forms and images at will; Thoughts that from earth, with wing'd emotion, soar, New tracts expatiate, and new worlds explore; Backward, through space and through duration, run, Passing the bounds of all that e'er begun; Then, as a glance of lightning, forward flee, Straining to reach at all that e'er shall be. THUS, in the womb of man's abyss are sown Natures, worlds, wonders, to himself unknown. A comprehension, a mysterious plan Of all The Almighty Works of GOD, is man; From hell's dire depth to Heaven's supremest height, Including good and evil, dark and light. What shall we call This Son of Grace and sin, This Dæmon, this Divinity within, This Flame Eternal, this foul mould'ring clod— A fiend, or Seraph—A poor worm, or GOD? O, the fell conflict, the intestine strife, This clash of good and evil, death and life! What, what are all the wars of sea and wind, Or wreck of matter, to This War of Mind? Two minds in one, and each a truceless guest, Rending the sphere of our distracted breast! Who shall deliver, in a fight so fell; Who save from this intestine dog of hell? GOD! Thou hast said, that nature shall decay, And all yon starr'd expansion pass away: That, in Thy Wrath, pollution shall expire, The sun himself consume with hotter fire; The melting earth forsake its form and face, These elements depart, but find no place; Succeeded by a peaceful bless'd Serene, New Heavens and Earth, wherein the Just shall reign. O then, upon The Same Benignant Plan, Sap, crush, consume This Mass of Ill, in man! Within this transient frame of mould'ring clay, Let Death's cerberean dæmon have his day; Let him tear off this world, the nurse of lust, Grind flesh, and sense, and sin, and self, to dust— But O, preserve The Principle Divine; In Mind and Matter, save Whate'er is Thine! O'er Time, and Pain, and Death, to be renew'd; Fill'd with our GOD, and with our GOD indued! END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>

PRINTED MDCCXXXV. The Author introduces his work with a general survey of the whole, in nature of the plan or argument; and then commences anew with a demonstration, a priori, of the being and attributes of God. Thence proceeds to creation, in which he endeavours at an opinion of the manner, as near as possible he may; as also of the nature and difference of the substances of spirit and matter; the economy of the universe; the astronomic system, physics, anatomy, and most branches of natural philosophy; in which the technical terms are as few, and the whole explained and made as easy and obvious as possible. The connection, dependence, use, and beauty, of the whole. Man considered; the nature of his being; the manner of his attaining knowledge; the analysis of the mind, faculties, affections, and passions; how they consist in each individual, and in the species. The nature of freedom; that it is not in the will; what it is, and wherein it consists, demonstrated. Of vice, misery, virtue, and happiness; their nature and final tendency. The whole being wrought into one natural and connected scheme, the author rises whence he began, and ends with a poetical rhapsody in the contemplation of the beauty of the whole. BOOK I. Tritonia! Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, is fabled to have sprung from the head of Jupiter; and, coming down on earth, to have viewed her own perfections in the lake Triton in Africa, from whence she was called Tritonia. She is here addressed as the IDEA of the Self-Existent Author of all things, as first containing in itself the beauty of all created things; and after, surveying that beauty by reflection from the things so created. goddess of the new born skies, Birth-day of heaven, wise daughter of the All Wise; When from Jove's head in perfect sapience born, Of heaven you rose the first empyreal morn, As erst descend— To mortals thy immortal charms display, And in our Lake thy heavenly form survey! Or rather Thou, whom ancient prophet stiles Venus Urania! This Venus, whom the ancients stiled Urania, or heavenly, is addressed as representing nature, or the creation, rising out of chaos in the perfection of beauty. born the babe of smiles, When from the deep thy bright emergence sprung, And Nature on thy form divinely hung; Whose steps, by Loves and Graces kiss'd, advance, And laughing Hours lead on the sprightly dance; While Time, within eternal durance bound, Harmonious moves on golden hinges round— Such, Goddess! as when Silence wondering gazed, And even thyself beheld thyself amazed; Such haply by that Côon artist Apelles, born in the island Cos or Côos. known, Seated apparent queen on Fancy's throne; From thence thy shape his happy canvas blest, And colours dipt in heaven thy heavenly form confest— Such, Goddess! thro' this virgin foliage shine; Let kindling beauties glow thro' every line, And every eye confess the work divine. O say, while yet, nor time, nor place was found, And space immense in its own depth was drown'd; If Nothing was, or Something yet was not, Or tho' to be, e'erwhile was unbegot; If caused, then how?—if causeless, why effect? (No hand to form, nor model to direct) Why ever made?—so soon?—or why so late? What chance, what will, what freedom, or what fate?— Matter, and spirit, fire, air, ocean, earth; All Nature born, nor conscious of its birth!— Alike unconscious did the womb disclose, And Nothing wonder'd whence this Something rose— Then, by what power?—or what such power could move? Wisdom, or chance?—necessity, or love? O, from what root could such high plenty grow? From what deep fount such boundless oceans flow? What fund could such unwearied wealth afford? Subjects unnumber'd! where, O where's your Lord? Whence are your attributes of time and place Won from eternity and boundless space? Motion from rest? just order from misrule? A world from nought?—all empty, now all full! From silence harmony? from darkness light? And beamy day from everlasting night? Such supposed as originally so, and being eternal. Light, matter, motion, music, order, laws! And silent dark nonentity the cause? But chance, you'll say—I ask you, chance of what, If nothing was?—'tis answer'd, chance of nought. Alike from matter moved One of the atheistical unaccountable evasions, is to account for the order of nature by matter and motion., could Beauty rise, The florid planets, and gay ambient skies; Or painted skies, and rolling orbs, dispense Perception, life, thought, reason, judgment, sense. Mysterious Thought! swift Angel of the mind! By space unbounded, tho' to space confined, How dost thou glow with just disdain, how scorn, That thought could ever think thee earthly born? Thou who canst distance motion in thy flight, Wing with aspiring plume the wondrous height, Swifter than light outspeed the flame of day, Pierce thro' the dark profound, and shame the darting ray; Throughout the universal system range, New form old systems, and new systems change; Thro' nature traffick on, from pole to pole, And stamp new worlds on thy dilated soul; (By time unlimited, unbound by space) Sure demonstration of thy heavenly race, Derived from that, which is derived from none, Which ever is—but of Himself alone! O could'st thou search—nor may'st thou search in vain, Haply some glimpse, some dawning to obtain, Some taste divine of thy eternal spring, Above those Heliconian bards to sing— How He who inaccessible remains, Yet omnipresent thro' all nature reigns; Whose age blooms ever in eternal youth, His substance, Beauty, and essential Truth, Essential Truth! and Beauty's charm! in course, Of boundless Love the ever boundless source! Of boundless Love, which would not, could not miss, To be the boundless source of boundless bliss!— Beatitude, rejecting all access! Repletion, never to be more, nor less! Why this Ineffable, this Inexprest, This Fulness in Himself, past utterance blest, Spontaneous pour'd these wondrous worlds around, And fill'd with blessings this immense profound? Swift rolled the spheres to their appointed place, Jocund thro' heaven to run the various race; Orb within orb in living circlets turn, And central suns thro' every system burn; Revolving planets on their gods attend, And tow'rds each sun with awful reverence bend; Still tow'rds the loved enlivening beam they wheel, And pant, and tremble, like the amorous steel. They spring, they revel in the blaze of day, Bathe in the golden stream, and drink the orient ray; Their blithe satellites with lively glance, Celestial equipage, around them dance; All, distance due, and beauteous order keep, And spinning soft, upon their centers sleep: The eternal clue the mazy labyrinth guides, While each in his appointed movement glides; Transverse, ecliptick, oblique, round they run; Like atoms wanton in the morning sun; The seeming vagrants joy to cheat the view, These turn, these change, these fly, and these pursue; The implicit discipline to order tends, And still in regular confusion ends— Each to his native vortex is assign'd, And magick circles every system bind; A deeper charm Attraction or gravitation. each individual holds, And firm within its atmosphere enfolds; The secret spell, thro' every part, and whole, Distinct, intire, invades it like a soul; Its atoms at the amorous touch cohere, And knit, in universal wedlock share. All teeming wedlock! on the genial hour, Space furnish'd out one boundless nuptial bow'r; Ten thousand thousand worlds, profusely gay, The pomp of bridal ornament display— How modified, here needless to be told; Whether terrene, or of ethereous mold; Gross, porous, firm, opaque, condense, or rare; Or argent, with celestial tempering clear; Pellucid, to imbibe the streaming light; Or dun, but with reflected radiance bright; Or dazzling shrine, or of corporeal leaven, Terrestrial, that unfold an earthly heaven Unspeakable! their landskip hill, and dale, The lowly sweetness of the flowery vale, The mount elate that rises in delight, The flying lawns that wanton from the sight, The florid theatres, romantick scenes, The steepy mountains, and luxuriant plains, Delicious regions! plants, woods, waters, glades, Grotts, arbours, flowrets, downs, and rural shades, The brooks that sportive wind the echoing hills, The pearly founts, smooth lakes, and murmuring rills— Myriads of Edens! blissful, blissful seats! Arcadian groves, sweet Tempe's blest retreats, Delightful Ennas, and Hesperian isles, And round, and round throughout, Elysium smiles— Consummate joy, peace, pleasure without end, Thro' mansions numberless their guests attend, Nor long inanimate—As when some cloud Throws on the beamy noon her sable shroud, Wide o'er the green a dusk and stillness creep, And glittering swarms beneath the verdure sleep; Quick, and at once, the drowsy shade gives way; At once breaks forth the bright enlivening ray; At once, the gay, the quickening insects rise, And gilded squadrons strike our wondring eyes; Musick flies wanton from ten thousand wings, And life and joy thro' every region rings— Or when glad news some sudden transport start, The flood swells instant in the labouring heart; The limbs its lively energy attest, And catch contagion from the exulting breast; Tumultuous, thro' our little world it flies, Smiles in the dimpling cheek, and lightens from the eyes— Or so—or yet beyond compare—as wide As spaces endless from some point divide, Sudden the universal world conceives; As sudden, nature with her burden heaves; Quick pulses thro' each throbbing artery beat, And all the matron glows with genial heat; At once reveals her offspring to the sight; Up spring the numbers numberless, to light! The one, the various, blessed, glorious birth, Of every world, heaven, ocean, air, and earth— Diverse, throughout their infinite abodes; Their essence, nature, virtues, forms, and modes Ineffable! that mock where fancy soars, Or what the deep of deepest thought explores, By visionary semblance, quaint device, By gloss, trope, type abstruse, or emblem nice— Ideal, how untoward to convey, Or reach conception by the dark assay. All perfect, yet alike not perfect found, With differing virtues, differing glories crown'd; The prime pre-eminent, and heavenly born, Whom splendors next to Deity adorn, Lightnings divine, indued with native right Of regal scepter and transcending might, Such, whom eternal Prescience might invest Far blazing, with monarchal titles graced; Of bright, the brightest; pure, the most refined; All intellect, quintessence of the mind; Cherubic harmonies, Seraphic flames, Empyreal natures with empyreal names, Natives of heaven!—Nor want the lucid spheres, Of blest inheritance the blissful heirs; Angelick shapes that wing the etherial space, And scarce inferior to the heavenly race; An incompounded radiant form they claim, Nor spirit all—nor yet corporeal frame; Than one, more dense—than t'other, more refin'd; If spirit, organiz'd—if matter, mind: Their essence one, imperishable, bright, Vital throughout, all heart, ear, sense, and sight. Thro' various worlds still varying species range, While order knits, and beautifies by change; While from the Unchangeable, the One, the Wise, Still changing endless emanations rise, Of substance duplicate, or triple, mix'd, Single, ambiguous, or free, or fix'd; From those array'd in heaven's resplendent robes, To the brute essence on terrestrial globes; Nor such inelegant, nor less demand The curious texture of the Almighty Hand: Thrice happy all, and lords of wide domains, Celestial vales, and elemental plains! One is the Flood which universal flows; And hence the reptile, hence the Seraph glows: Still equal, tho' inequal, that and this; Since fulness bounds, and all are fill'd with bliss. Now, had the Eternal Architect supreme, In amplitude stretch'd out this wondrous frame, Equipt magnificent the house of God, Thro' height, and depth, his boundless, blest abode! One house, one world, one universe divine, Where countless orbs thro' countless systems shine; Systems, which, viewed throughout the circuit wide, Or lost, or scarce the pointed sight abide, (Thro' space immense with diminution seen) Yet boundless to those worlds that roll within; Each world as boundless to its native race, That range and wanton thro' its ample space, Frequent, thro' fields, thro' clouds of fragrance stray, Or skim the watery or etherial way: For now, with vivid action, nature swarms, And life's dear stream the purpling conduit warms; The continent, blithe air, and floating seas, The smiling lakes, swift floods, and winding bays, The nooks, the crannies, nurse a numerous brood, And aptly yield their alimental food, Adjusted to the trunk's unwieldy size, As nice proboscis of luxurious flies, Or azure tribes that o'er the damson bloom, And paint the regions of the ripening plum. From every root, the lavish plenty grows; In every stream, perpetual pleasure flows; Each ravish'd sense with endless bounty feast, The Soul, and ear, and eye, and smell, and touch, and taste. Their sweets, the blossoms plants and flowers bequeath; Elixirs from the steaming vapours breath; In balm imbosom'd every region lies, Of ambient æther, and infolding skies; As the great Mover wrapt each wheeling sphere In the soft down of elemental air Transparent, to imbibe the golden beam, And wide around spun out th' etherial stream, Where worlds in endless revolutions move, And swim on the abyss of endless Love. Urania! Nature! from thy heights descend; And low to earth thy bright irradiance bend; Dispel the clouds that round our fancy stray, The mist that damps our intellectual ray; And shew what power all height of power transcends, And in one act performs ten thousand ends. Say, why this globe The advantage of the earth's situation— has its appointed place, And why not vagrant thro' the boundless space? Why here preferr'd, sagacious to refuse What thwarts propriety, convenience, use? Why not more neighbour to the burning ray, Or more remote from the declining day? Or here of its motions—, not sedentary fixt and still, Admonish'd by no voice, obsequious to no will? Or moving, why in circling eddies round, And not progressive thro' the immense profound? Or endless while the dizzy drunkard reels, And round the sun its annual motion wheels, Whence that innate diurnal, giving to its inhabitants the grateful vicissitude of day and night, adjusted to the times of labour and rest— and delegated power, Central to spin the swift diurnal tour? Not self revolv'd, throughout its airy race, It might expose one constant sultry face, Damn its antipodes with endless night, And curse with fire the restless sons of light; These ne'er to slumber on the dewy lawn, Nor those to rise and bless the golden dawn. Or tho' rotation duplicate endears Sweet change of days, and nights, and rolling years; What new vicissitudes the manner of its annual motion, calculated for the useful and delightful variety of the seasons; the mutual allay of immoderate heat, and cold; as also for the successive growth and recruit of vegetative nature. of motion bring The seasons, circling, to the vernal spring? Whether thro' heaven the winding compass steers, Or pendulous by mutual balance veers, What Secret Hand the trepidation weighs, Or thro' the zodiac guides the spiral pace? What magick wand the floating orb confines With polar circles, and the tropic lines? Or does some Voice the potent charm command? Too potent for unwieldy worlds to stand!— “Here, nor elsewhere, thou earth, thy station keep; “Here, roll thy progress thro' the boundless deep! “My Word's the bias, and my Will's the way, “That wheels thy circlet round the lord of day; “That round thy axis spins thy cumbrous frame; “That cheers thee with the still returning beam; “That whirls thy wondrous motions, one in three, “Where time, and place, still varying, still agree.” Omniscience here no lower mean admits; One slip had maim'd ten thousand thousand hits, Where to one point unnumber'd causes tend, Concurring to effect one destined end, Which once attain'd pours forth ten thousand more; A blessed sea, that never knows a shore! “Ye Learn'd! The stupidity of those who will not perceive. who wisely can deny your God, “And banish Omnipresence with a nod; “In shrewd contempt, at final causes sneer; “In wilful deafness shut the tortuous ear, “Nor think it suited to the sounds ye hear; “Who, in your wisdoms, negatively spy, “How vain's the texture of the useless eye; “While fondly thus prime reasoners you'd commence, “By literally exploding common sense, “And plead for one concession (only due) “That nature must have err'd—in forming you— “Approach, ye Sages, to your parent earth, “Much wiser than the clods on whom she lavish'd birth!” With deepest art How, even to the extent of infinite wisdom, as nothing less could be the author, (vide supra, l. 305.) all is formed and contrived, and in that contrivance adapted, and in that adaption directed, and in that direction extended distinctly, and in that distinction entirely, for the life, light, and comfort of the whole, and through that whole of every part of this our globe! of infinitely possible inconveniencies, no one avoidable inconvenience being admitted; as of infinite advantages attainable, there is not one, consistent with the nature of this earth, left out., her skilful plan she lays; With equal scale, the least advantage weighs; How apt, for time, place, circumstance, and use, She culls all means, that to all ends conduce! Nice to a point, each benefit selects; As prudent, every mischief she rejects; In due proportions, time, and motion, metes, Advances to a hair, and to a hair retreats: Constant to Good, for that alone she veers, And with the varying beam her offspring chears; Cools all beneath her equinoctial line, And gives the day throughout the world to shine; The nitre from the frozen pole unseals, And to the tropic speeds the pregnant gales; Here, leaves the exhausted fallow to recruit; Here, plumps and burnishes the ripening fruit; Superfluous hence withdraws the sultry beam, Here drinks anew the vivifying flame; Returns, still faithful to the labouring steer— Wide waves the harvest of the golden year; Trades universal on from pole to pole, Inspires, revives, and cultivates the whole; Frugal, where lack, supplies with what redounds, And here bestows what noxious there abounds; This with the gift, and that with giving, blest, Alike, throughout, of every wish possest. Wrapt in her airy car the wonderful texture of the air or atmosphere—, the matron glides, And o'er the firmament ascending rides; The subtile mass its copious mantle spreads, Its mantle wove of elemental threads; The elastick flue of fluctuating air, Transfused invisible, enfolds the sphere; With poinance delicate its surprizing subtilty, penetrating even deep below the surface of the earth— pervades the whole, Its ear by which it is as it were one universal sense to this our globe—, eye, breath, and animating soul; Active, serene its modification, admitting various, contrary, and even seemingly inconsistent qualities, suited as well to the single and separate interests of every individual, as to the entire and uniform weal of the whole—, comprest, rare, cool'd, or warm'd, For life, health, comfort, pleasure, business, form'd; Useful around, throughout, above, beneath!

BOOK II. This, and the two ensuing books, contain and finish the general survey or epitome of the whole, being a piece in itself distinct and complete. The author then commences de novo, and proposes to answer every doubt, and illustrate at full every part of the foregoing abridgment. Thus does the mazed inexplicable round, The aspiring bard, and all his flights confound; Ambitious thro' his airy tour to sing, High born above the soar of Pegasean wing; Or raised sublime in prospect, while he turns, Views nature round, and still with rapture burns: Now in this light the charmer he surveys, This light he hopes her every charm displays; But here unthought of charms discovered lie, And flash new wonders on the admiring eye; While Beauty, changing with alternate grace, Varies the heaven of her all lovely face. Bewilder'd thus, from scheme to scheme he's tost, And in inextricable windings lost; Where to begin, proceed, or how conclude, This part omit, or hopeless that elude, Doubtful. Again elated in his theme, A daring unexampled task he'd claim, And wide unfold the Universal Frame; In mortal draught Immortal Beauty snare, And stamp this leaf as Nature's volume fair. High argument! nor hopeless to prevail, Though for the flight Dedalian plumage fail Icarus.; Tho' erst of that ambitious youth we read Bellerophon., Dismounted from the Muse's fabled steed, And story with alluding caution tell, How from the sun's bright car the headlong driver fell Phaeton.: Nature, unerring tutoress, shall preside, And through her endless revolutions guide; Her various maze its windings shall unbraid, Her doublings trace themselves, while self betrayed Her complications to connection lead. For while the circumambient air The advantage of the atmosphere's elastick texture; by which it yields to, and closes imperceptibly upon all moving bodies— we sing, Its springy tension, and elastick spring; The quick vibration of the yielding mass; How objects The surprizing transparency, continuity, and coherence of its parts, forming an uninterrupted medium for the conveyance of all objects to the eye— thro' its lucid medium pass; For Nature by which it is as it were an universal looking-glass, wherein all nature beholds, admires, and enjoys her own complete perfections— how the smiling glass expands; Narcissus like, how beauteous Nature stands, Self-loved within the splendid mirror shines, But self enjoy'd, nor like Narcissus pines; How, as a talisman Its curious disposition for the conveyance of light; which would be of no use in vacuo, as it is only perceptible itself, by rendering other objects visible— of magick frame, This atmosphere conveys the enlightening beam, Reflects, inflects Its still more wonderful quality, in not only reflecting, but refracting, and inflecting the morning and evening beam; in appearance lifting the sun about four degrees above his station, and refracting the light to us when the sun is about eighteen degrees below the horizon; by which means our day is prolonged about two hours, and the tedious night in the frigid zones shortened annually about thirty-two days—, refracts the orient ray; Anticipating sheds the rising day— High from his seat the solar glory heaves, (Whose image fires the horizontal waves) Abridging, shears the sable robe of night, And thro' the globe protracts the chearful light; With sweet preambling by refraction of the rays creating the dawn, and gradual twilight; without which we should be suddenly immersed in an intolerable flood of day, and without a moment's warning shut up in immediate darkness. twilight blends the shade, And gently lets our evening beam recede. Thus, born on airy wings The use of light must be apparent, to as many as have eyes to enjoy its benefit; but much more to those, who the further they pry into nature, by the assistance of this element, will still more and more discover an inexhaustible fund for delight and admiration— the radiance flies, Quickening the vision of poetick eyes; Whence we may pierce into the deep profound, And, searching, view the wondrous system round: For wide as universal Nature What can be more amazing, than the expansion and extension of light, which though a body, propagated from body, and ponderous in its nature, is so thin and subtile, as to reach and dilate through an inconceivable compass of space, before the whole content would amount to one drachm of weight— spreads, Light's sacred fount its streaming lustre sheds; Still orient, to the parting beam succeeds; Thro' azure climes a sumless journey speeds; Its restless longitude the glory darts, Nor less a boundless latitude imparts; Where matter borders The swiftness and length of its progress is no less admirable, extending possibly ad infinitum, and moving in one second of time near two hundred thousand of our miles; without which miraculous velocity, its useful and glorious effect and influence could never be preserved:— on retiring space, Impulsive urges the perpetual race; Stupendous length, illimited by aught Of numbers summ'd or multiplied by thought! But whence the Light's and as this perpetuated motion and vigour has not the least relation to any property inherent in matter, it can only be accounted for as flowing from the original Fountain of Light and Truth— invigorating force, Its active energy, or secret source, Must be ascribed to that Eternal Spring, Whom First, and Last, and ever Blest we sing— Who only could who alone could speed and support this his winged messenger, on his universal errand to nature— his effluent Angel send; Athwart the gulph the radiant blaze extend; Kindle the mass to incorporeal speed; The flame, with never dying splendors feed; With heat giving power to him only of unsealing her treasures, and unfolding her beauties; whereby the world's glorious and harmonious system becomes obvious, and the whole evidently as elegant, as it is useful.—, the universal page unseal; With light, the universal charm reveal; In prospect wide the illustrious work display, And gem the pavement of the milky-way; Make grace from use, and use from beauty flow; With florid pencil, shade the jasper bow; The warring elements Is it not wonderful, that even Almighty power, out of one principle of matter, should constitute four; and by an endless compounding, modifying, and changing those four, should produce that infinite variety, which is visible in the universe? in wedlock bind, Water and fire, dull earth and active wind; Knit by Almighty Order they cohere, And in their ever varying offsprings share. First to the deep He speeds his eldest born Light. Beside the two elements of air and light, already treated of; what a spacious field do the waters, and first the ocean, yield, for contemplation and praise!, Whose rosy progress paints the purpling morn; The mingling glories o'er the surface play, And ocean dances to the trembling ray. Wide to the beam In the expansion of its superficies, without which it would never afford a sufficient quantity of vapours, to supply the thirsty land— his ample sea He spreads, And deep beneath the methods by which its waters are preserved pure from corruption, by the mixture of salts, whose weight is calculated to prevent their exhaling— subside the briny beds; The spacious beds the liquid realms contain; The seasoning tinctures purge the foamy main; But, poised by balance of eternal weight, The salts perpetual hold their watery seat, Nor in the tepid exhalations mount, To fire the chrystal of the cooling fount. The Almighty Fiat the number, size, and qualities of its inhabitants, all adapted to its gross and tempestuous medium— bade the deep conceive, And finned with clustring tribes the vital wave, From huge Leviathan's enormous frame, To those who tincturing paint the crimson stream; With watery wings they skim the yielding seas; Their central poise its gravitation weighs, Adjusted, steady to their varying size, By geometrick rule, and calculation nice: These have their palaces being provided, without their own labour, with all the delights and conveniencies of life—, and coral groves, Their latent grotts, and pearly bright alcoves; Wide is the copious hand as well as nourishment for the support of it— of Bounty spread, And myriads at the plenteous feast are fed. Nor less their ocean being a medium and atmosphere to them, as our atmosphere is to us; and equally suited to their natures, for respiration, as the conveyance of light from the heavenly luminaries—, the grateful light salutes their eye, And solar glories gild the nether sky; Their ocean blushes with the lord of day, And nightly glitters at the twinkling ray. The moon, attended by her starry train, Reflects reflection to the floating plain, Its murmuring flux How admirably is the moon's influence on tides (which preserves the great body of waters from stagnation) regulated, to the very point that can alone conduce to order and advantage: were she nearer, or larger; further off, or less; or were there more moons, so as on any hand the influence should be in the least altered; the whole earth would be rendered uninhabitable, by being poisoned with stagnated vapours, or perpetually overflowed with deluges— with pale dominion guides, And swells the pride of its returning tides; The deep those wholsome agitations purge, And drive stagnation from the rolling surge; Their rage the Sovereign Moderator cools, And riding, as a steed the bounding billow rules; Whence rising floods their stated empire know, Nor wasteful o'er the neighbouring regions flow. Low as the sea's capacious basin sinks, The thirsty soil the incumbent ocean drinks; Whence, thro' the globe As there is no point from whence the riches of nature do not flow in upon us; so there are two (though seemingly most opposite) methods of supplying us with sweet and refreshing waters; one perennial, and from beneath, being thence attracted through our globe as any liquid when touched by a piece of sugar; which cannot be ascribed to the pressure of our atmosphere, as it is readier performed in vacuo; the salts being separated by filtration through the strata, and the rising waters being opposed by a clayey substance that generally lies near the surface of the lower lands, they proceed to the mountains, from whence, by the advantage of a descent, they spread wealth and pleasure round all the earth— diluting liquors pass, And circulate, as in our smaller mass; The salts with curious percolation strain, And kindly thro' the porous strata drain, Attracted, in a maze of tubes exhale; (A stiffening clay cements the spacious vale) From whence opposed, the mountain's height they claim, And thence perpetual pour the winding stream; Or lower, in perennial fountains rise, Nor dread the star that fires autumnal skies. While ocean thus The other method being by exhalation, the manner as above described; for heat being the most subtile, light, and agile of all bodies (if it may be called more than a quality of body) by its subtilty penetrates, and by its levity rarifies the humid parts of matter; and then by its agility breaking loose, carries off the parts so rarified; which being by that means rendered lighter than the air, mount till they rest or float in that part of the atmosphere that bears a specifick or proportionable gravity; and hence arises— the latent store bequeaths, Above its humid exhalation breaths; Its bosom pants beneath the vigorous heat, And eager beams the expanding surface beat; Insinuating, form the lucid cell; To bladders the circumfluous moisture swell; The inflated vapours spurn the nether tide, And mounted on the weightier æther ride: As tho' in scorn of gravitating power, Sublime the cloudy congregations tower; O'er torrid climes collect their sable train, And form umbrellas the use, beauty, and variety of our meteors; for as the chief operator in raising the vapours is heat, so on the other hand— for the panting swain; Or figured wanton in romantick mould, Careering knights and airy ramparts hold, (Imblazoning beams the flitting champions gild, And various paint the visionary field;) Sudden the loose inchanted squadrons fly, And sweep delusion from the wondering eye; Thence, on the floating atmosphere they sail, And steer precarious with the varying gale; Or hovering, with suspended wing delay, And in disdain the kindred flood survey: When lo! the chief artist in forming the several meteors out of those vapours, is cold; as the afflicting æther checks their pride, Compressing chills the vain dilated tide; Their shivering essence first rain, by expulsion of the rarifying heat; upon which the little bladders or vesicles knocking against each other, conglobe in the contact, and growing heavier than the atmosphere, fall down in larger, or smaller drops, according as the constituent parts of the cloud were more or less contiguous— to its center shrinks, And a cold nuptial their coherence links; With artful touch the curious meteor forms, Parent prolifick of salubrious storms When from on high frequently causing storms of wind, by condensing, and thereby destroying the equilibrium of the atmosphere; the parts so condensed, pressing upon the parts more rare, and dilated, by warmth; which pressure produces the wind, which is no other than a current of air— the rapid tempest's hurl'd, Enlivening as a sneeze to man's inferior world: The frigid chymist Thunder and lightning. culls the mineral store, The glossy sphærules of metallick ore; Sublimes with nitre the sulphureous foam, And hoards contagion in heaven's ample dome, Where nature's magazine fermenting lies, Till the bright ray athwart the welkin flies; High rage the small incendiary inspires, Whose kindling touch the dread artillery fires; Quick, with effusion wide, the lightnings glare; Disploding bolts the cloudy entrails tear; The cleansing flames sweep thro' the etherial room, And swift the gross infectious steam consume: Our vital element the blaze refines, While man, ingrateful, at his health repines. With various skill the chilling artist works, And operator chief in every meteor lurks: Oft, where the zenith's lofty realms extend, E'er mists, conglobing, by their weight descend, With sudden nitre Snow. captivates the cloud, And o'er the vapour throws a whitening shrowd; Soft, from the concave, hovering fleeces fall, Whose flaky texture cloaths our silver ball. Or when the shower forsakes the sable skies, Haply the cold in secret ambush lies, Couching awaits in some inferior space, And chills the tempest Hail. with a quick embrace; The chrystal pellets at the touch congeal, And from the ground rebounds the rattling hail. Or constant Or where the cold is a constant inhabitant in the upper regions; which by reason of their distance from the earth, are but little affected with the reflection of the sun-beams, which reflection chiefly promotes the intenseness of heat; there the rising vapours are repelled, because meeting with the cold, they, in a great measure, lose that active principle of heat, which was the chief motive of their ascension; and floating as the gale veers, are obstructed in their match by the mountains, or higher lands; and more vapours still gathering as they are obstructed, their parts, or little sphærules, become more neighbourly, or contiguous, than when they had a freedom of ranging wide from each other; and so jostling, run into, or incorporate one with the other; and descending by the laws of gravity— where this artificer dwells, And algid from his heights the mist repels, The Almighty Alchymist his limbeck rears, His lordly Taurus, or his Alpine peers; Suspending fogs around the summit spread, And gloomy columns crown each haughty head, Obstructed drench the constipating hill, And soaking soak into the hills, that are generally of a gravelly, mineral, or lax substance, through which the moisture distils; till finding, or making a vent to issue at, by the advantage of a descent, they pour their fertile and delicious streams over all the earth— thro' the porous grit distil: Collected from a thousand thousand cells The subterraneous flood impatient swells; Whence issuing torrents burst the mountain's side, And hence impetuous pour their headlong tide. Still central from the wide and this advantage of a descent is the more wonderful and happy, inasmuch as without it we should have no rivers, and consequently be poisoned and overflowed with the standing and stagnating waters: for who, but the Almighty Director, could lead the currents from their first source, by a gradual winding, and nice declivity, frequently through a miraculous length of about three thousand English miles? while flowing perpetual through various climates, and nations of different manner, and languages, they bear and spread around society, trade, commerce, riches, plenty, refreshment, luxuriant health, blooming verdure, and endless delight— circumfluous waves, (Whose briny dash each bounded region laves) The soil, still rising, from the deep retires, And mediate, to the neighbouring heaven aspires. Hence, where the spring its surging effluence boils, The stream ne'er refluent on the fount recoils, But trips progressive, with descending pace, And tunes, thro' many a league, its warbling maze; Here blended, swells with interfering rills; And here the lake's capacious cistern fills; Or wanton, here a snaky labyrinth roams; Impervious here, with indignation foams; Or here with rapture shoots the nether glade, And whitening silvers in the steep cascade; Or slackening here, its length of labour sooths; And slumbering soft, its sleepy surface smooths; Wide, deep, and slow, the doubtful current glides, And o'er the flux the tilting vessel rides. The embroidered banks their gaudy fringes dip, And pendent flowers the smiling liquors sip; Or gently where the humid mirrors pass, The forest rises to the watry glass; Self-worshipping the stately shade admires, And to a double heaven its height aspires. The social stream a winding motion steers, And mindful of the neighbouring region veers; With traverse or inverted circuit bends, Nor leaves, unvisited, remotest friends; With genial bounty spreads the verdant wealth, And pours large draughts of ever blooming health: Delight diffusive down the current flows, And pleasure on the flowery margin grows. Thro' many a realm, where mighty monarchs reign, The stately flood protracts its floating train; Revolving suns the wondrous length pursue, Nor in one day the liquid wanderer view; Its facil maze the varying seasons wind, And chrystal flakes the struggling fountain bind, Which distant glows beneath the fervid beam, And into ocean pours and disemboguing their floods into the sea, there finish— the copious stream. Thus Beauty flows only still to repeat and continue the eternal circle and order in all things— in one perpetual ring, And uses circling from our oceans spring; Beneath, attracted, thro' the strata rise; Above, exhaled, usurp the ambient skies; Meet in the limpid source, or purling rill, And bathe the vale, or sweep the shelving hill: From hence their tributary floods repay, And grateful nourish the recruited sea; The sea replenished trafficks as before, And back to earth returns the fruitful store. To earth! for here, concentring, air, and fire, And flood, in mutual triple league conspire: Since He that order, which the Supreme Self-Existence, to manifest his own power and goodness, has caused to flow through an infinite variety of creatures; and yet has founded that infinite variety on the union of a few principles; which few principles are further, and ultimately resolvable, and united in Him, the only Original, and Self Eternal Principle., on whom the mighty fabrick leans, The Eternal, from eternity ordains Variety, which union must produce; And order knit consummate, into use; That Deity throughout the world may shine, And Nature's birth confess her Sire Divine. Nature, bright effluence of the One Supreme! O how connected is thy wondrous frame! (Thy grand machine, thro' many a wanton maze, Steered where it winds, and streightning where it strays, There most direct where seeming most inflext, Most regular when seemingly most perplext, As tho' perfection on disorder hung, And perfect order from incaution sprung) Still, endless as thy beauteous scenes arise, Still, endless multiplies our deep surprize. Say, does each mote The reason why I represent, as above, the various opinions of atheists, in one ridiculous light (when they may be supposed to differ much in their notions, and the learned treatises they have written for our instruction to carry a great appearance of ingenious and metaphysical argumentation) is, that the truth, and matter of fact, upon enquiry and reflection, will be found exactly and literally as I have represented it; and that all their ambages and circumlocutions center and turn upon one point, which is this, that whoever attempts to rob the world of a Superintendant Providence, or Designing Wisdom, does thereby necessarily ascribe all that is of connection, order, or beauty in the world, to blind, and insensible matter; and is, therefore, guilty of the ridiculous absurdities and contradictions above set forth. For, as the wit, or invention of men, has never yet laid down any atheistical hypothesis, however subtile or various, but what is evidently resolvable into, first, a Fortuitous Concourse of Atoms; secondly, an Eternal Operating Necessity; or, thirdly, an Endless Round, or Succession of Causes and Effects; if those gentlemen, who would thus point out our God, mean, as they often pretend, that He is any thing more than bare matter; we shall soon find their intention, by separating the terms they have annexed as operators for the assistance of stupid matter: and on our part it will be but common gratitude, to enquire, to which of these three pretended Causes, we are obliged for the particular benefits we receive, or (as members of the great whole) for the formation and order of the universe, or nature itself. First then; as Chance is the operator assigned in a Fortuitous Concourse of Atoms; we would know, what this Chance, this wise and ingenious artist, is—Is it a substance? No, that is not pretended:—Matter? nor that:—Quality of matter? nor that neither.—What, neither subject, nor attribute?—No.—It is then, what is not; or is not any thing that is: it is, in truth, what, by way of apology, we assign as a cause of any effect produced, when our ignorance or idleness will not permit us to enquire, or find any other;—a meaning, without an idea; or even less, a word without a meaning:—And thus when Chance is introduced for the solution, Chance unluckily happens to leave all the operating burden upon that poor matter it was called to assist. As in the second place I also fear there will be immediate occasion for calling upon Chance to help out their Necessity, and that it will prove equally treacherous as before. For as Necessity is the supposed operator here, if it be asked, is this Necessity distinct from the things it necessitates? The answer is, Yes, by all means; since to assert otherwise, is allowing it to be the thing operated, and not the operator; and so the Original Superior Cause be as far to seek as ever. If then it be asked, Is this Necessity conscious, intelligent, free, or designing? That doubtless is denied, else we have there the very God we desire.—But then, if it should be unluckily started, that if this Necessity is neither designing, conscious, nor intelligent, it is altogether as blind as matter; and if not free, is as much in need of, and equally subjected to a Higher Cause as matter can possibly be; being consequently a Necessity necessitated, and not acting, but acted upon; if this, I say, should be objected, there must either be recourse to the old wise solution, that so it happens; or a Higher Necessity or unintelligent Cause be alleged, and so another to support the second, and another the third, ad infinitum; like the elephant bearing the earth, the crab the elephant, and so on; which procedure, ad infinitum, to assign a Cause, shews that, ad infinitum, they will be as far as ever from assigning a True Cause, and so, ad infinitum, no Cause at all will be assigned. The third and last shift is an Endless Succession of Causes and Effects, where all the subtilty consists in the word Endless; for whatever is incapable of being a Cause in any time, ever was, and ever will, through eternity, continue equally incapable. And here, if the question be asked, Whether any of these Effects be original, independent, or superintendent? The answer is negative, if it were only to avoid a direct absurdity and contradiction: if then it be asked, what these Effects are? The answer is, that the Effects are no other than matter variously modified and actuated; for that is the utmost degree of perfection they will allow them, for fear of bordering too near upon spirit. Again, if it be asked on the other hand, whether among the Causes, there is any One original or independent? The answer, doubtless is, No; for to allow there were, would be contrary to the hypothesis laid down. But then observe the necessary consequence of all this; for first, if none of these Effects are original, independent, or superintendent; and they all consist of matter variously modified and actuated, they are no other than matter still, whatever action or modification be produced—And secondly, if on the other hand, among the Endless Causes, there is not any one Cause Original, or Independent, there is not any one Cause but what is effected; and every one being effected, the whole, which consists of them, is effected, and therefore is all Effect; and all the Effects being matter actuated and modified, the whole is consequently no other than matter actuated and modified; and so finally recurs, and in every light, view, shift, and evasion, resolves in this, that matter alone operates upon itself; and tho' destitute of design, wisdom, foresight, order, or direction, yet wisely foresees, designs, directs, and orders all things. know its peculiar place, All conscious, thro' the gulf of boundless space? Can atoms be omniscient, to discern (What human wisdom strives, but strives in vain to learn) What mode mysterious paints the purpling rose, What melts the current when Mæander flows? What modes our adamantine marble bind? What ruffle active in the blustering wind? From inky jett exclude the piercing day; Or thro' the brilliant drink the trembling ray; Nip in the frost, or in the furnace glow; With gay enammel arch the showery bow; With various influence our senses greet, Point in the sour, grow luscious in the sweet, Scent in the civet, stifle in the draught, Light from the doe the tainting odour waft, Excite the nostril of the opening hound; More subtile still the organick sense compound; Thro' elements, plant, reptile, man, and brute, This thing to that, and all to other suit? Can clay, such virtues, forms, and modes assign? Debating, methodize, conspire, combine? Studious deliberate on the publick weal, And ne'er like human politicians fail? Each particle its separate province chuse, Nor that prefer, nor froward this refuse; Each for itself, and for the whole advise; All good, all right, all perfect, and all wise? Prophetick, thro' eternity foreknow, From past, what future revolutions flow? Can each be omnipresent, to perceive What endless links the blended fabrick weave, On every various consequence reflect, Prepare each cause to yield the just effect, Sum up the whole, and thence the whole connect? O dotage! dreamers! who could once suppose The passive mass its Maker should inclose, And the formed clay its forming Lord compose. “Ye Atheists! if ye will be Atheists still, “And will, no cause but this, because ye will; “If stubborn, in your little reason's spight, “Ye will judge wrong, because ye wo'nt judge right; “Thus argue—Since the clue of boundless space “Winds worlds on worlds, and wonders wonders trace; “'Tis Order above rule that guides the plan, “And Wisdom, far beyond what wisdom can; “The Bounty boundless, Beauty without end: “And who'd believe a God, he cannot comprehend?” For deep, indeed, the Eternal Founder lies, And high above his work the Maker flies: Yet infinite that work, beyond our soar; Beyond what Clarkes can prove, or Newtons can explore! Its union, as of numbers to the sound Of minstrelsie, to heavenly rapture wound, On harmony suspended, tunes the whole, Thrills in our touch, and lives upon our soul; Each note inclusive melody reveals, Softening within the Eternal Finger dwells, Now sweetly melts, and now sublimely swells; Yet relative each social note extends, Throughout is blended, while throughout it blends Symphonious, ecchoing the Supreme's design, Beauty of Love, and Symmetry Divine! BOOK III. Thus Beauty mimicked in our humbler strains, Illustrious, thro' the world's great poem reigns! The One grows sundry by creative power; The Eternal's found in each revolving hour; The Immense appears in every point of space; The Unchangeable in nature's varying face; The Invisible conspicuous to our mind; And Deity in every atom shrined: From whence exults the animated clod, And smiling features speak the Parent God; Who here, and there, and every where abounds: Air uttering, tells His Harmony in sounds; The light reveals the Fountain of its rays, And like the Seraph kindles in His praise; The floods ambitious to His glory rise, And seek their Source throughout His ambient skies; Thence, in united congregations fall, And tune their anthems o'er the warbled ball; The ball enlivening at His order springs, And rounding to its central Maker clings: The Maker! ample in his bounty, spread The various strata of earth's genial bed For the use of the strata or layers of earth in the conveyance of fountains and sweet waters, see Book II.; Tempered the subject mass The mere matter, or caput mortuum supposed in all terrestrial bodies— with pregnant juice, And subtile stores, of deep and sacred use; Salts, oils, and bitumen, and unctuous pitch, With precious tho' mysterious influence rich; Mercurial, nitrous, and sulphureous spume, Fermenting virtual the terrestrial womb. Hence, where the solar heat and searching air, Transgressive, pierce our actuated sphere, The arch-chymists which so impregnated, and modified by air and heat as above recited, supplies— work as in a secret mine, And nature's crude originals refine; Here blending mix, here separate, here select, And purging here the incongruous parts reject; Perennial bind the flint's impervious rock, And strict its adamantine texture lock; The future monumental marble stain, And wanton thro' its variegated vein; Salubrious here the mineral medicine mix; Here the once potable utensil fix; Here modify with ever varying change; And here the similar effluvia range; Compact the lustre of metallick ore, The steely, argent, or Corinthian store; Or severing, cast in nature's purest mould The dense elixir of refulgent gold. Thro' sparkling gems the plastick artists play, And petrify the light's embodied ray; Now kindle the carbuncle's ruddy flame; Now gild the chrysolite's transparent beam; Infuse the saphire's subterraneous sky, And tinge the topaz with a saffron dye; With virgin blush within the ruby glow, And o'er the jasper paint the showery bow. Endless the task, and arduous, to unfold What secrets earth's prolific entrails hold: In nature's womb what embryon treasures sleep, The wondrous natives of the hoary deep: Whence happy oft', oft' hapless they aspire; Supply what want can wish, or pride require— Blest are the blameless means, the curse is the desire. Hence comfort the comfort of firing in coals and other combustibles— kindles in the chearful blaze, Tho' fire upon the expiring martyr preys; The peasant hence the manure of lime, marle, and other mooring— manures the exhausted soil, Tho' lordlings share the product of his toil; Hence artists variety of curious and beautiful stone, for the benefit of habitation, and exercise of art— in the princely dome survive, Tho' drones may occupy its ample hive; Hence medicines many medicinal and healing drugs— yield the salutiferous pill, But gently qualified can learn to kill: Hence medals metals for the conveyance of useful history to future ages in sculpture, statuary, embossment, &amp;c.— may reveal the patriot's face, Altho' a tyrant gild the nether space; Once more return great Socrates to light, Or with an Alexander blast the sight— (Who here approves the infamy of fame, Shares Alexander's guilt, and Alexander's shame) Nor less the plough-share those metals affording also many engines, utensils, &amp;c. for procuring and accelerating nourishment, and other conveniences and delights in life— needs the Lydian blade, Tho' steel and pride the neighbouring realm invade; The tools to life subservient we alledge, Tho' deadly cruelty can whet their edge: Such we approve as also coin, for ascertaining the value, and speeding the transmigration of property in trade and commerce; as may best suit each person's convenience and advantage— the trade supporting ore, Tho' avarice purloin the shining store; In Maro's hand the precious treasure view, It spreads all bounteous as the heavenly dew. Shall Nature check the beauty of colours— the purple colouring globe, Lest magistrates should trail the splendid robe? Nor beauteous and lustre of jewels. her adorning brilliants wear, Lest gems should deck the follies of the fair? “Ah Nature! thou hadst scaped thy only blot, “Could man but cease to be—or hitherto were not: “Ay, there's the task, the labour of our song— “To prove that All is right, tho' man be wrong.” Emergent from the deep view Nature's face, And o'er the surface deepest wisdom trace; The verdurous beauties charm our cherished eyes— But who'll unfold the Root from whence they rise? Infinity within the sprouting bower! The seed, which, as here described in its vegetative state, may be said to contain or be divided into— Next to ænigma in Almighty Power; Who only could infinitude confine, And dwell Immense within the minim shrine; The eternal species in an instant mould, And endless worlds in seeming atoms hold. Plant within plant, and seed enfolding seed, For ever—to end never—still proceed; In forms complete, essentially retain The future semen, alimental grain; And these again, the tree, the trunk, the root, The plant, the leaf, the blossom, and the fruit; Again the fruit and flower the seed enclose, Again the seed perpetuated grows, And Beauty to perennial ages flows. Such the Supreme his wondrous Sata made, E'er yet their foliage cloath'd the novel glade; Gave each a texture of peculiar frame, And nature correspondent to its name; Gave different powers to propagate their kind, And varying means to various ends assign'd; Then o'er the globe the missive treasure strow'd, And first the Eternal Hand earth's spacious bosom sow'd. Here elemental principles unite, To give the new consummate birth to light: The glebe, now pregnant, yields nutritious food; Lymphatic dews, their mild diluting flood; The sun affords his rarifying sphere, And æther breathes its actuating air; Quatruple, round the temper'd embryon meet, And its fine tegument its teguments or coats; the main body included in the coats, and the root and plume, or plant, included in the main body— fermenting greet; Whence subtile juices pierce the filmy skin, Repeating vigorous their attacks within; Thence thro' the lobes with percolation strain, the main body (though single in some, and in some more numerous) is generally and distinctly divisible into two equal parts, which are called lobes; and these lobes contain— And thence infusing thro' their radix drain; the seminal root, whose branches being spread through each lobe in equal moieties, unite at the extremity of the seed in— Thence limpid to the plantal root distil The plantal root, or,—, And each impregnated aperture fill, With swoln repletion thro' the portals float, And now unclasp the nice cutaneous coat; The radicle now obvious radicle; which being supplied with juices in the two methods as above described, (i. e. first from the seminal root, and after from the earth to which it becomes obvious) communicates the nourishment to its plume, or young plant, which is closely included, and shut up in a narrow cavity within the lobes— they unfold, And to its infant lips their liquors hold; The instinctive lips imbibe the gentle tide, And thro' the veins the milky liquids glide, Ascending visit the inclusive plume, (Where Nature wantons in minutest room, Where folded close, her implicated size Of trunk, branch, leaf, and future semen lies) Conspicuous its dilated form display, And give its texture to apparent day. Around the plume the guardian lobes arise which lobes, upon a further growth, are effoliated, and rise about the young plant in two dissimilar leaves, (being now nourished in their turn by the radicle which they had formerly fostered) and thus protect and embrace it round, and nourish its infancy with refreshing dews, which they hold to it as in a basin, embalming it round, while yet the scanty moisture of the radicle is insufficient for its support; till having acted their part on the vegetable stage, nature gives them their discharge, and they rot off, or fall away., And fence their minor from inclement skies; With pious dews his early verdure bathe, Perform their trust with never failing faith; Till, self-sufficient, they retire to earth, And leave the stripling to his right of birth. Now fervid beams the rising sap exhale, And air ingredient wings This very principle in our air, or atmosphere, which chiefly conduces to, or is the very essence of animal and vegetable life, is also the very principle of corruption, or the dissolution of the parts of matter, as shall hereafter be made evident. the vital gale; The solids in diluting moisture pass, And colds condense the vegetating mass. The labial pores of every various root Their orifice to varying natures suit, Admit effluvia of peculiar mode, And delicate the incongruous parts explode. Salts, oils, and sulphurs, thro' the entrance tend, And similar, with proper members blend; To sight, smell, taste, their several powers dispense, And aptly ravish each luxuriant sense; Still graceful, vary in some new delight; Still obvious, please the involuntary sight. Our transient optick o'er the surface plays, And Nature's superficial mien surveys; But rare with deeper inquisition pryes, Where Beauty's wrapt, recluse from vulgar eyes, Essential, sits on Truth's Eternal Throne, And universal, reigns o'er worlds unknown; Displays her sway thro' unimagined scenes, Elysian tracts, and philosophic plains: These, these are climes of ever-living joy; Truth ne'er can satiate, Reason ne'er can cloy. O worthy! far more worthy to explore, Than treasured lustre of Peruvian ore; Or supererogated store, acquired By pilgrimage, to saintship long expired. In Nature's realms no wretched levees wait, No monarchs hold their arbitrary seat; Far different law her beauteous empire sways, And Order dictates her unerring ways. Here may we spy, from the Supreme of things, How first the originate material springs; How substituted nature moulds her forms, What tender love her infant embryo warms, What tempering skill the boon conception frames; And trace her maze of complicated schemes, Where differing parts identity compose, Yet endless how, from One! each varying essence flows; Each vegetable set in beds of bliss, Their sap exhaling from the Prime Abyss. See, bashful The various motions of roots. why the downward roots retire, (While up to heaven their kindred trunks aspire) Obliquely some, and some with steep descent; Some level, with direct, or tortuous bent; Some to a root their tethered trunks condemn, Attracting prone the yet reluctant stem; While some peep up, to view the gladsome skies; And some rotund, with bold projected size, And intersected horizon, arise. See, wondrous thus how each sagacious root, As marksmen, to their several signals shoot; What Cause revers'd the separate bias guides, And whence the still dissenting movement glides. Their figures The various figures of roots., pliant to some plastic Skill, Alike obsequious to Its secret Will, With pointed cone the yielding strata pass; Or here, accumulate their bulbous mass; Here bulky, taper, parted, or entire; Here writhing, twist their complicated wire; Here ramified, their forky branches spread; Or tassell'd here, their fibrous fringes shed; Adjusted thro' each multifarious sect, And efficacious to some point elect— Elect, within while Wisdom dwells replete, Incomprehensive thro' His sacred seat. Hence, hence alone, the final causes tend, And reach unerring each appointed end; The maze of endless implication wind, Directed by the clue of All Perceiving Mind. Hence from the Seraph's intellectual ray, To reason's spark, that gilds our sensual clay; To life (scarce conscious) in the instinctive brute; To reptile, plant, and vegetating root; The features in conspicuous semblance shine, And speak, thro' all, One Parent All Divine. Thus answering lively Analogy or similitude of animal and vegetable life. to organic sense, The plants half animate their powers dispense: The mouth's analogy their root displays, And for the intestine viscera purveys; Their liquors thro' respondent vessels flow, And organ like their fibrous membranes grow: Nor yet inadequate their congruous use Of mucilages, lymph, and lacteal juice; The flood consimilary ducts receive, And glands refine the separated wave; Redounding vapours thro' the pores transpire, And for the fresh ingredient guests retire. Revers'd, their trachæ operate from beneath, And thro' the trunk aerial conduits breathe; Their lignous fibres with continuous length, Equivalent, compact a bony strength; But formed elastic, with inclining shade, Their yielding stems each stormy gust evade: So forest pines the aspiring mountain cloath, And self-erected towers the stately growth. But where the strength The various provision of nature for the security and preservation of every species— of mighty fabric fails, There art with ample recompence avails, By interposing skill to poise the eternal scales; While these, more valid thro' dependence gain, And strong in indigence on Nature lean. Thus from the couch of earth's embroider'd bed, In elegance of vernal foliage spread; From pulse leguminous, of verdurous hue; From herbal tribes, bedropp'd with morning dew; The gourd, inhabiting the pastured glade; The tufted bush, and umbelliferous shade; The feeble stems that luscious viands bear, Nor less sublime their pampered tension rear: Thro' botany, thro' every sylvan scene, That various deck the vegetating plain, Even to the proud primæval sons of earth, That rise superior in their right of birth, Whose heights the blasting volley'd thunder stand, In ruin still magnificently grand; Distinct, each species of peculiar frame, Distinct, peculiar love and fondness claim; Indulged by Nature's kind parental care, As each alone were her appointed heir. Thus mantling snug protecting and supplying the indigent, as the strawberry, cinquefoil, &amp;c,— beneath a verdant veil, The creepers draw their horizontal trail; Wide o'er the bank the plantal reptile bends, Adown its stem the rooty fringe depends, The feeble boughs with anchoring safety binds, Nor leaves precarious to insulting winds. The tendrils next and supporting the feeble, as the vine, bryony, ivy, &amp;c. and thus equally propagating a perpetuity, as spreading a universality of delights, pleasures, and enjoyments, in—, of slender helpless size, Ascendant thro' luxuriant pampering rise; Kind Nature sooths their innocence of pride, While buoy'd aloft the flowering wantons ride; With fond adhesion round the cedar cling, And wreathing circulate their amorous ring; Sublime with winding maturation grow, And clench'd retentive gripe the topmost bough; Here climb direct the ministerial rock, And clasping firm its steepy fragments lock; Or various, with agglutinating guile, Cement tenacious to some neighbouring pile; Investing green, some fabric here ascend, And clustering o'er its pinacles depend. Defective, where the harmony of connection, fragrance of thickets, refreshment of shades, and beauty of colours— contiguous props evade, Collateral they spring with mutual aid; Officious brace their amicable band, And by reciprocal communion stand: Bless'd model! (by humanity expell'd) The whole upholding each, the whole by each upheld. Their social branch the wedded plexures rear, (Proximity of combination dear) High arching, cypher love's enamour'd knot, And wave the fragrance of inviting grot, Or cool recess of odoriferous shade, And fan the peasant in the panting glade; Or lace the coverture of painted bower, While from the enamell'd roof the sweet profusions shower. Here duplicate charming the eye of proportion with the regularity of vistas, and other various dispositions; and forming tuneful mansions and choirs for the feathered musicians., the range divides beneath, Above united in a mantling wreath; With continuity protracts delight, Imbrown'd in umbrage of ambiguous night; Perspicuous the vista charms our eye, And opens, Janus like, to either sky; Or stills attention to the feather'd song, While echo doubles from the warbling throng. Here, winding to the sun's magnetic ray, The solar plants adore the lord of day, With Persian rites idolatrous incline, And worship towards his consecrated shrine; By south from east to west obsequious turn, And moved with sympathetic ardours burn. To these adverse, the lunar sects dissent, With convolution of opposed bent; From west to east by equal influence tend, And towards the moon's attractive crescence bend; There, nightly worship with Sidonian zeal, And queen of heaven Astarte's idol hail. “O Nature, whom the song aspires to scan! “O Beauty, trod by proud insulting man, “This boasted tyrant of thy wondrous ball, “This mighty, haughty, little lord of all; “This king o'er reason, but this slave to sense, “Of wisdom careless, but of whim immense; “Towards Thee! incurious, ignorant, profane, “But of his own, dear, strange, productions vain! “Then, with this champion let the field be fought, “And nature's simplest arts 'gainst human wisdom brought: “Let elegance and bounty here unite— “There kings beneficent, and courts polite; “Here nature's wealth—there chymist's golden dreams; “Her texture here—and there the statesman's schemes; “Conspicuous here let Sacred Truth appear— “The courtier's word, and lordling's honour there; “Here native sweets in boon profusion flow— “There smells that scented nothing of a beau; “Let justice here unequal combat wage— “Nor poise the judgment of the law-learn'd sage; “Tho' all-proportion'd with exactest skill, “Yet gay as woman's wish, and various as her will.” O say, ye pitied, envied, wretched great, Who veil pernicion with the mask of state! Whence are those domes that reach the mocking skies, And vainly emulous of nature rise? Behold the swain projected o'er the vale! See slumbering peace his rural eyelids seal; Earth's flowery lap supports his vacant head; Beneath his limbs her broider'd garment's spread; Aloft her elegant pavilion bends, And living shade of vegetation lends, With ever propagated bounty blest, And hospitably spread for every guest: No tinsel here adorns a taudry woof, Nor lying wash besmears a varnish'd roof; With native mode the vivid colours shine, And heaven's own loom has wrought the weft divine, Where art veils art; and beauties beauties close, While central grace diffused throughout the system flows. The fibres The interior texture of vegetables., matchless by expressive line, Arachne's cable The cobweb, or—, or ætherial twine viscous threads that float in the air., Continuous, with direct ascension rise, And lift the trunk, to prop the neighbouring skies. Collateral tubes with respiration play, And winding in aerial mazes stray. These as the woof, while warping, and athwart The exterior cortical insertions dart Transverse, with cone of equidistant rays, Whose geometric form the Forming Hand displays. Recluse, the interior sap The motion of the fluids— and vapour dwells In nice transparence of minutest cells; From whence, thro' pores or transmigrating veins Sublimed the liquid correspondence drains, Their pithy mansions the pith, bark, and insertions being of one texture and coherence. quit, the neighbouring chuse, And subtile thro' the adjacent pouches ooze; Refined, expansive, or regressive pass, Transmitted thro' the horizontal mass; Compress'd the lignous fibres now assail, And entering thence the essential sap exhale; Or lively with effusive vigour spring, And form the circle of the annual ring, The branch implicit of embowering trees, And foliage whispering to the vernal breeze; While Zephyr tuned, with gentle cadence blows, And lull'd to rest consenting eyelids close. Ah! how unlike those sad imperial beds, Which care within the gorgeous prison spreads; Where tedious nights are sunk in sleepless down, And pillows vainly soft, to ease the thorny crown! Nor blush thou rose, tho' bashful thy array, Transplanted chaste within the raptured lay; Thro' every bush, and warbled spray we sing, And with the linnet gratulate the spring; Sweep o'er the lawn, or revel on the plain, Or gaze the florid, or the fragrant scene; The flowers forensic beauties Of flowers. now admire, The impalement, foliation, down, attire, Couch'd in the pannicle, or mantling veil, That intercepts the keen, or drenching gale; Its infant bud here swathed with fostering care, Or fledg'd and opening to the ambient air; Or bloom dilated in the silken rose, That flush'd mature, with kindling radiance glows; Or shrunk in covert of its mantling bower, (Now ushers evening cool, or chilling shower) And skill'd prophetic, with eluding form, Anticipates approach of ruffling storm. Or now we pore with microscopic eye, And Nature's intimate contextures spy; Her œconomics, her implicit laws, The effects how wondrous deep!—how wondrous High the Cause! Now view the floret's miniature of state, And scorn the scepter'd mansions of the great: Not architrave embellish'd so adorn, Whose fretted gold reflects the beamy morn; Within, the guests of animalcule race Luxuriant range at large its ample space; Or now in elegance the banquet spread, While millions at the sumptuous feast are fed. Now see whence various propagations breed, The sucker, scyon, sprout, and embryon seed The seed in its generative state. In wall concrete of peachy stone secured, Or in the bower of wainscot core immured; Or fœtus in the secondine contain'd, Its juices thro' the umbilic fibres drain'd; With birth of prosperous generation spring, And round, and round, hold on the eternal ring. While Pleasure whispers in the balmy gale, Or wantons venial in the revell'd dale, Delight reclined attends the purling rill; Health bounds luxuriant o'er the topmost hill; The mount aspiring Contemplation climbs, And outward forms to Inward Truth sublimes; Surveys the worlds that deck the azure skies, Reflects how beauteous earth's productions rise; The system one, One Maker stands confess'd, The Prime, the One, the Wondrous, and the Bless'd; The One in various forms of Unity Express'd! BOOK IV. The author having, in the third book, taken a short survey of vegetable nature, proceeds to consider the animal system: and first life in general. That life, perception, &amp;c. are terms applicable to some being of whose essence we can form no adequate idea, verse 7th, &amp;c. Yet that such perception and consciousness are an evident demonstration both of the existence, and simplicity of such essence; and in this simplicity consists what we call personal identity, or sameness, 13: that, nevertheless, we are not to conclude that every organized being is informed with such an essence, so as to have an actual principle of motion and perception; since many such may possibly be no other than pieces of Almighty mechanism, and matter so curiously acted upon, may deceive us with the appearance of internal action, 23. That if ever matter is wrought to such an appearance of life, it is the utmost perfection its nature is capable of; and that it is impossible it should be endued with any real act or perception; demonstrated, 51. That therefore what we call the soul, or such essence so distinct from matter, must exist the same for ever, as it is simple, indissoluble, and unchangeable, 65. The wonderful and inconceivable obligation incumbent on all who have received such a benefit, 75. That as no other return can be made to the Author of beneficence, gratitude and benediction should be universal in their praises from all animate creatures, 97. As all, the most minute and even invisible animalcules, par- take his regard and providence, 110. As also the wonders of almighty artifice, in the texture of their frame; which is here given as an instance of general organization, and bodily œconomy, 120. The circulation of the blood continued contrary to all the known laws of motion, by the operation of two oppositely acting causes, 142. This illustrated by a comparison, 163. Which comparison, though seemingly disproportioned, is not really so, the terms great and little being barely relative, and One alone being absolutely great, in respect of Whom all things else are as nothing, 205. All motion, and sensation, conveyed by the mediation of the nerves to and from the brain, 243. where the soul is seated; and there receiving her intelligencies from the senses (which are here described) informs the whole bodily system, and through the organ of vision, surveys the beauties of nature, 203, to the end. Fresh from his task, the rising bard aspires, And all his bosom glows with recent fires: Life, Life, new forms and constitutes the theme! The song too kindles in the vital flame, Whose vivid principle diffusive spreads, And thro' our strain contagious rapture sheds. Whate'er the spark, the light, the lamp, the ray, Essence or effluence of Essential Day, Substance, or transubstantiate, and inshrined, Soul, Spirit, Reason, Intellect, or Mind; Or these but terms, that dignity the use Of some Unknown, some Entity abstruse— Perception specifies Tho' (upon the reasons and authority of an eminent author) it has long been admitted, that personal identity, or sameness, consists in consciousness; yet as consciousness, whether by direct, or reflex perception, may, at most, be no other than the inseparable operation, or active principle of some simple, unchangeable, or individual substance; it is obvious to dispute, that such identity, or sameness, may more truly exist in the simplicity, or unchangeableness of such substance, than in any operation, whether separable, or inseparable: and yet, on the other hand, it is most evident, that a consciousness agreeing through differently distant points of duration, or (if I may be allowed the expression) a consentaneous perception, is the highest demonstration of the identity of such substance, as no one substance, or being, can perceive for another; which again is a further demonstration of the simplicity, or unchangeableness of such substance, as it now perceives for that very self, which it also perceives was the same, or identical self, from the first instant of its perception, notwithstanding all the various changes, and revolutions it has observed through all nature beside— the sacred guest, Appropriate to the individual breast; Whence, independence thro' dependence flows, And each unknowing his existence whence we know, that we who now are, were in times past; though what we are, or were, we know not—, knows; Existence, varied by Almighty plan, From lowly reptiles, to the pride of man; While incorporeal neither the manner in which the union between such substance and matter is made, so as to inform the stupid mass with an action utterly alien to its nature. in corporeal dwells, Distinct, in union, of associate cells; Whence powers their prime informing acts dispense, And sovereign guide the ministry of sense. Tho' what! In the account to which this note is annexed, I have doubtless assigned a capacity of higher perfections to matter than it will easily be admitted susceptible of; and therefore I was obliged to call in no less than— if oft, while nature works unseen, And locomotive forms the nice machine, Sublimed and quick thro' elemental strife, The insensate boasts its vegetative life; A steaming vapour thro' the mass exhales, And warming breathes its imitative gales; Fomenting in the heart's vibration plays, And circling winds the tubulary maze; With conscious act the vivid semblance vies, And subtile now the sprightly nerve supplies; Unconscious lifts the lucid ball to light, And glares around with unperceiving sight; Or studious seems to muse with thought profound, Or lists as 'waked to catch the flying sound— So temper'd wondrous by mechanic scheme, The Sovereign Geometrician Omnipotence to support the scheme, who actuating and informing all nature by his wisdom, as he created it by his will, the creature so subjected cannot possibly withstand the creating power, and nothing to him is impossible, but impossibility, that is impotence, or what in the very supposition destroys that very power it would assert;—nor are such impotential hypotheses unfrequently started, and defended by a misguided zeal, which in the behalf of Omnipotence would destroy the very nature of power, indistinctly confounding truth and falsehood, and thereby ascribing and subjecting all things rather to an unaccountable arbitrary will, than to an infinite power ever guided equally by that infinite wisdom which equally and infinitely contemplates and actuates nature, agreeable to that order and those laws originally by that wisdom impressed on all things.—I should be unwilling to lay an error of this kind to the charge of a worthy prelate of a neighbouring nation, author of a late most learned treatise, wherein he denies that brutes, or the inferior animal system is endued with any being distinct from matter, and yet does not seem to me to account for the existence of actions of such animals as mere machines; but if I do not grossly misapprehend him, he ascribes to them, and consequently to mere matter under the term of animal life, an inferior kind of perception and ideas, and thus has carried the perfections of matter to a higher pitch than I can pretend to with any appearance of reason or even possibility.—I shall hereafter have a more ample and proper opportunity to shew the absurdity of this hypothesis, and shall at present only hint a few reasons that are applicable to the occasion, which are these— knits the frame; In mode of organizing texture wrought, And quick with spirited quintessence fraught: When objects on the exterior membrane press, The alarm runs inmost thro' each dark recess, Impulsive strikes the corresponding springs, And moves the accord of sympathetic strings; Effects like acts inevitable rise, (Preordinate in the Design Allwise) Yet still their earthly origin retain, Reductive to the principle terrene, Tho' curious to deceive with mimic skill, And feint the dictate of interior will. Here, matter's fix'd Whether matter be divisible ad infinitum, or not, if it is capable of any degree of perception, such perception must either be naturally inherent, or arise from some peculiar modification:—now as no two parts of matter can exist in the same place, (for then neither part would exist in any place, as each would occupy the place of the other) the parts however harmoniously modified, or closely united, are absolutely distinct from each other, since their coherence can only consist in neighbourhood or contiguity, and not in corporation:—if therefore the parts so distinct have any inherent perception, they must have a perception as distinct from each other as their parts; and if divisible ad infinitum, there is such a confusion of indistinct distinct perceptions, as is too absurd for any thing but a jest.—But if matter is reducible to atoms, and every atom supposed to perceive, I would ask how atoms can be organized so as to see, hear, smell, &amp;c. and if organization is necessary to the perception of matter, either such perception arises intirely new from the organization, or the organization only gives a liberty of action to the perception that was prior and distinctly latent in every part:—but if in the former supposition such perception is solely produced by the organization or modification, organization or modification, however nice or mechanic, being no other than a mode of form, or figure, the most extraneous and incidental of any property of matter, and perception being the most absolute and simple of any thing we know, and by which alone we know all that we do know; such hypothesis I say carries in itself such a palpable contradiction and confutation, as to make what is simple, absolute, and invariable, to be produced by what is most compound, precarious, and changeable, nay, by a mere relative term, figure being no other than the circumscription of space surrounding a finite body.—But, if in the last case and refuge, organization or modification is supposed only to give a power of action to what was before latent in the parts of matter, if the perceptions continue still as distinct as the parts, here must arise such a multiplicity of perceptions, as must destroy and confound the very operation of the organs by which the parts perceive. And lastly, if it be alleged that by the modification, the parts become so loving and neighbourly, as by sharing the perception of each other to make one amicable union of the whole, each part must still retain its proper right to its portion of perception; and if upon any accident a member of the system should be lopped off, why then truly a piece of such united perception being gone, we have only a piece of perception remaining; and thus also perception the most simple of all units must be daily and hourly divided by the perpetual flux of matter— eternal barriers stand; Tho' wrought beneath The Almighty's Forming Hand, Tho' subtilized beyond the kindling ray, Or sacred flame of heaven's empyreal day, No plexured mode, no aptitude refined, Can yield one glimpse of all-informing mind; The parts distinct in firm cohesion lie, Distinct as those that range the distant sky; Time's fleeting points the unreal self devour, Varied and lost thro' every changling hour; Whence, the precarious system, tho' compact, Can ne'er arrive to individual act; Since impotence absurdly should ensue, Distinction be the same, and one be ten, or two. Not so, in intellectual Whence I must necessarily and inevitably conclude, that whatever being is endued with the least degree of perception, must be a being, substance, or essence, as widely and oppositely distinct from matter, as any two things can be imagined: and though I do not see but such essences may be of infinitely different natures, and consequently differ in their manners and degrees of powers and perfections; yet as no being can perish but by annihilation, which though no contradiction to Almighty power, can yet never be admitted consistent with that creating wisdom which does nothing in vain; since even matter is otherwise imperishable, however its variation may deceive us, which only arises from its accidental properties of divisibility and cohesion: I must from the whole as necessarily and inevitably conclude, that what ever being is endued with any degree of real perception, as it cannot be affected with those accidental properties of matter, neither can it be affected with the variation that arises thereon, and must consequently exist in a higher enjoyment of powers and perfections, and that for ever. splendors bright, The soul's irradiance burns with native light, With vision of internal powers profound, A pure essential unit, incompound; Celestial Queen, with conscious scepter graced, And rights in prime of vital action placed! Hence by identity all thought subsists, And one, in the existing one, exists; The one indissoluble must exist, And deathless thro' eternity subsist. Thou Sole Prerogative, Supreme of Right, Deep Source The meaning of the expression is, that the reason or necessity of the Deity's existence is included in himself. of Principle, and Light of Light, Whose Is will Be, whose Will Be ever was, Of Self Essential Coessential Cause! If not unhallow'd, nor the song profane, Nor voice of matin elevation vain; Prime, as the lark with earliest rapture springs, And warbling soars to Goodness, warbling sings, To Thee permissive sings with venial lays, And wings his pittance of ascending praise— O! whence to Us? or whence to aught? but Thee! The word, the bliss, the privilege,—to Be— Or if to Be, for Thee alone to Be, Derivative Great Author Sole! from Thee Thou Voluntary Goodness! thus immense To pour the largess of perceptive sense, Sense to perceive, to feel, to find, to know, That we enjoy, and You Alone bestow. Could increation crave Thy Vital Skill, The virtual Fiat of Creative Will? Less can Thy Flow of Plenitude receive Reversion from the goods Its Bounty gave. Come then, O Gratitude, endearing guest, In all thy feeling soft suggestions drest, And heave the swell of each exulting breast! Thou Sentiment of friendship's cordial tye! Thou Thanks expressive from the moistening eye! Thou pledge assured of firm Dependence dear, Reposed on Omnipresence, ever near— Thro' all that breathe, waft, waft thy hallow'd gale, And let the universal wish exhale; In symphony of vocal transport raise, And mount to Heaven the tributary praise! Whence, happy creatures! all your blessings flow, Your voice to praise Him, and your skill to know; Whence, as the drops that deck the morning's robe, And gem the bosom of the twinkling globe, Profusive gifts the Smiling Goodness sheds, And boon around His boundless plenty spreads; Nought, nought exempt; the myriad minim race Inscrutable amid As I claim no advantage from a poetical licence, to assert any thing contrary to what I apprehend as truth; it may reasonably be demanded here, how it comes to be known that there are animalcules so minute, as cannot come under the cognizance of our senses, by which alone we can perceive them. But I think it may more reasonably be answered; that since for many ages past the continual and successive improvements that have been made in natural philosophy, by perpetually displaying new and unimagined scenes of knowledge, do at the same time demonstrate there are many yet unopened; and since the use of glasses shews us how much our eyes were defective, and the further invention and improvements of such glasses still shew the defect of all the former, and yet can never arrive to the perception of any part of matter or inanimate body more minute than many systems and species of beings endued with animal life; I say, upon such consideration, it would be extremely absurd to stop here, and assert there is nothing further left for an Infinite and All Operating Wisdom. the etherial space, That mock unseen, while human optic pries Or aids the search with microscopic eyes, The sweets of Deified Complacence claim; To Him display the wonders of their frame, His own contexture, where Eternal Art, Emotive, pants And further—As equivocal generation, upon the soundest reasons, search, and experiments, is most justly exploded—however difficult it may appear to our apprehension, it is most certain, that such animal life in any material being, however minute, cannot exist without organization; since upon its supposition of being a mere machine, it must still have within, and throughout, those secret wheels and springs of motion, to which the machines of human artists may bear an inferior analogy or resemblance. And on the supposition of its being immaterial, but in union with a material vehicle; if the being in such union is perceptive, there then must consequently be a proper medium or organization for the conveyance to such perception—And again, this organization in the present flux and incertain state of matter, must be supported, continued, and supplied by as proper and equivalent means, as— within the alternate heart: Here from the lungs the purple currents glide, And hence impulsive bounds the sanguine tide, With blithe pulsation beats the arterial maze, And thro' the branching complication plays; Its wanton floods the tubal system lave, And to the veins resign their vital wave; Thro' glands refining secretion—, shed specific juice, Secreted nice to each appropriate use; Or here expansile nutrition—, in meanders bend, While thro' the pores nutritive portions tend, Their equal aliment dividual share, And similar to kindred parts adhere. From thousand rills the flux continuous drains, Now swells the porta, now the cava veins; Here rallies last the recollected blood, And on the right pours in the cordial flood: While gales ingredient respiration, and— to the thorax pass, And breathing lungs imbibe the etherial mass; Whence, their licentious ducts dilation claim, And open obvious to the welcome stream, Which salient, thro' the heart's contractile force, Expulsive springs its recontinual course. The captive air impatient of retreat, Refines expansive with internal heat, Its levity too rare to poise the exterior weight; Compressive round the incumbent æther lies, And strict its elemental fold applies, Whence either pulmonary lobe expires, And all the interior subtile breath retires; Subsiding lungs sanguification; the manner of which (so long and often debated) is as clearly and intelligibly represented, as the conciseness of this plan will admit; and is in some measure illustrated by the following— their labouring vessels press, Affected mutual with severe distress, While towards the left their confluent torrents gush, And on the heart's sinister cavern rush; Collected there complete their circling rout, And vigorous from their venal engine shoot. Again the heart's constrictive powers revive, And the fresh fountain thro' the Aorta drive; Arterial valves oppose the refluent blood, And swift injections push the lingering flood; Sped by the last, the foremost currents bound, And thus perennial run the purpling round. So where beneath allusion; where the earth may be considered as representing the solids of the animal system—the exhalations and streams as representing the circulating fluids—the wind or gales conveying those exhalations, the interior breath—and the influence of the moon on tides, the external influence of the atmosphere, which by compressing the thorax, and lungs, acts as antagonist to the natural contraction of the heart's muscular texture; and by embracing the outward members of the body, thereby, in some measure, actuates and assists the blood to mount in its return, and ascent, contrary to all the known laws of motion. the culminating beam From India south the expanded oceans steam, Intense their fervid exhalations rise, And scale the steep of equinoctial skies; Collected now progressive proudly sail, And ride high born upon the trading gale; Now 'thwart the trope, or zone antartic steer, And now aloof the Cape's emergence veer; Now wheeling dextrous wind the Æthiop main, And shading now the Atlantic ocean stain; Now westward hang o'er Montezuma's throne, And view the worlds to ancient worlds unknown: Around the antipodes the adventurers roam, And exiled never hope their native home; Some pious drops the restless vagrants shed, And now afresh their wing'd effusion spread; Askance, or cross the broad Pacific deep, Obliquely north the floating squadrons sweep; Still arctic ply to reach the frozen pole, Now hurry'd on Sarmatian tempests roll; Sinister round extreme Imaus bend, And glooming o'er the Scythian realms depend; Now driven before the keen Septentrion fly, And intercept the clear Norossian sky; Now view where swathed the mighty Tartar lay; Now sidelong hover on the Caspian sea; Now gather blackening from the farther shore, And o'er Armenia sluice the impetuous store; Euphrates here and rapid Tigris swell, And weep their streams where great Darius fell. Primæval there, the blissful garden stood; Here, youthful Ammon stemm'd the torrent flood. Circumfluous rolls the long disparted tide, And mighty realms the wandering flux divide: Here, Nineveh, and fair Seleucia rise; There, Babel vain, attempts the laughing skies, While proudly round the female structures gleam, And break and tremble in the blazing stream; Proficient whence, the liquid confluence meet, And thro' the gulph their kindred ocean greet; Urg'd by the moon, abjure the pearly shore, And travel whence they sprung—to travel as before. How the song smiles That the former comparison is by no means inadequate; great and little, being but relative terms, in respect of finite essences; and magnitude, or minuteness, as they appear or disappear reciprocally by comparison, depending barely on the relations, and not the essences or nature of things; as the term little is greater than what is less, and is only little by being compared with something greater; so that, properly speaking, whatever is finite, in respect of what is finite, is not really little; whereas, on the other hand, in respect of infinity, all things finite are equally diminutive; being equally remote from—, should deeming censure chide As disproportion'd, thro' allusion wide! What tho' we join this globe's encumber'd frame, The deep unfathom'd, and the copious stream, With all the appendage of incumbent skies, To match the frame of animalcule size— Our theme no great (of One exclusive What is Infinite, Who alone is Absolute, Great, and Independent.—) knows; No little, when from One, that One, it flows; This globe an atom thus to any person, who should compare this stupendous globe of earth and ocean, to its vortex, or the vast extent of space that includes our planetary system, in which Saturn takes thirty years to finish his circle round the sun; upon the supposition that such person were transported to the sun in the center of our vortex, and the earth transported beyond the planet Saturn, to the uttermost verge of the vortex; this earth, though shining with reflected light, would not then appear even as a point, and would only be visible by the assistance of a telescope.— to the native space, Where vortical it wheels its annual race; Its vortex Again, should such person contemplate the surrounding vortexes within his ken, where all the planets or inhabited worlds disappear, and nothing is perceeived but a glimmering ray shed from the several suns that shine each in the center of their proper vortex; upon comparing our vortical system to those other worlds or systems that appear numberless in his view; it is evident, that in the comparison, our system would barely hold the proportion of a unit in number, or a point in magnitude— (by adjacent whirl-pools bound) A point to worlds that circling blaze around; Lost in the whole and yet further, should our thoughts extend to take in those other vortexes, systems, and suns, that are only visible by the help of glasses; and extending yet further, comprehend the whole imaginable and grand material system or universe: in this comparison, all the visible worlds in their turn would shrink to a proportionate point.—, these vanish in their turn, And but with relative effulgence burn: But where finite But should we attempt yet higher, and compare the universe of matter, to immensity, the attribute of Deity; here the whole universal system, with which our thoughts were so greatly expanded, quite vanishes; since whatever is finite, as finite, will admit of no comparative relation with Infinity; for whatever is less than infinite, is still infinitely distant from Infinity, and lower than infinite distance the lowest or least cannot sink— to Infinite aspires, Shrunk from its Lord, the universe retires; A shade its substance, and a blank its state, Where One, and only One, is only Great! All equidistant in respect therefore of the Creator, all creatures are upon a level—, or alike all near, The reptile minim, or the rolling sphere; Alike minutely great, or greatly less, In form finite and yet by being creatures, even the most seemingly despicable, bear such relation to their Creator, as expresses His stamp and character sufficient to make it most highly valuable to all its fellow-creatures; who are themselves only valuable, by sharing and partaking the same Divine Influence— Infinitude express; Express the seal of Character Divine, And bright, thro' His informing Radiance, shine. Just so as when sublime which Divine Influence or character not only declares the immediate operation and art of omnipotence, but even so far is expressive of the very attribute of Deity, that whereas outwardly we can assign no certain bounds to the works of an infinite energy— the fancy soars, And worlds on worlds illimited explores; No end of thought, or time, or space is found, And each immense, are each, in either drown'd: So when the mind so; on the other hand, within we are as much lost and bewildered, in attempting to find or assign any point or period in the texture of the most minute animalcule— to central beauty tends, And strict to fix some certain period bends, In vain its ultimate contraction's sought, And still delusive, shuns the labouring thought; While That Immense while the harmony and infinity of the Eternal Artist are, in some degree; impressed on his works; and as outwardly we can find no bounds, so inwardly we can find no end of art and beauty—! whence every essence came, Still Endless reigns in each minutest frame. Attentive then inspect Shall we then slight, or deem that little, in which immensity is so conspicuous? or trivial, which could employ no less than infinite wisdom and power? the wondrous scene, Nor deem our animalcule's texture vain; Where tuned thro' every corresponding part, Its system closes in consummate art. Quick, from the mind's It has already been proved in this book, where the circulation of the blood was treated of (vide supra) that the least animalcule must distinctly and perfectly have all the proportion, symmetry, and adjustment of that organized texture, which is indispensably necessary for the several functions of animal life: and as I there chose the smallest of imaginable animal creatures for the general instance of the oeconomy of an animal body; so here I continue it as an instance of general motion and sensation, both of which are performed by the mediation of the nerves, that all tend to, and arise from the brain and spinal marrow. And though formerly I shewed that matter when so curiously organized, might possibly be susceptible of motion, and even the appearance of sensation, by the correspondence of its inward texture with the outward impulse, or impressions made on it, like the answering harmony of a musical instrument (vide supra); yet I further demonstrated, that bare matter cannot possibly be susceptible of the least real sensation, or perception (vide supra). I am therefore obliged, upon this occasion, and on the supposition of actual sensation, to introduce— imperial mansion shed, With lively tension spins the nervous thread, With flux of animate effluvia stored, And tubes of nicest perforation bored, Whose branching maze thro' every organ tends, And unity of conscious action lends; While spirits thro' the wandering channels wind, And wing the message of informing mind a being of a nature distinct from matter, which being situate in the original point of motion and sensation—; Or objects to the ideal seat convey; Or dictate motion with internal sway. As when, beneath the sultry Lybian ray, Coop'd in his camp (like Julius Cæsar in his camp at Ruspina in Afric, when attacked by Scipio and the confederate forces of Juba) without moving from that situation, receives all the concurrent intelligencies from abroad, by which means it is instructed to send forth its orders and emissaries as occasions require, and thus directs and informs the whole bodily system. the Julian hero lay, Full on the ditch the dusk Numidians bound, And Rome's last hopes recruited rage around; Serenely still, amid the dread alarms, See, Cæsar sits, the mighty soul of arms! See, at his nod, the various combat burns, And the wing'd scout still turns, and still returns! While he, the war sedately weigh'd informs, Himself unmoved amid surrounding storms. Just so supreme It is an observation of an author learned in the law, that “non omne simile quatuor pedi-“bus currit;” yet as our passions (the operation of which is above described) may be called a state of warfare, the simile even in that respect is not unjust., unmated, and alone, The Soul assumes her intellectual throne; Around their queen attendant spirits watch, Each rising thought with prompt observance catch, The tidings of internal passion spread, And thro' each part the swift contagion shed. With motive throes the quickening limbs conceive; The blood tempestuous, pours a flushing wave; With raging swell alternate pantings rise; And terrors rowl within the kindling eyes. The mind thus speeds her ministry abroad, And rules obedient matter with a nod; The obsequious mass beneath her influence yields, And even her will the unwieldy fabric wields. Thro' winding paths I did not think it necessary to insert here the sense of feeling, not only because there is no special or peculiar organ to which it bears relation, but because I take it for a sort of universal sense, all sensation being performed by contact; and so— her sprightly envoys fly, Or watchful in the frontier senses lie; Brisk on the tongue tasting— the grateful gusto greet, And thro' the nerves return the ideal sweet; Or incense smelling— from the nostrils gate exhale, And to their goddess waft the odorous gale; Or musical to charm hearing, and— the listening soul, Attentive round the tortuous ear patrole, There each sonorous undulation wait, And thrill in rapture to the mental seat; Or wondrous seeing, being but a different kind of touch, or feeling, agreeable and accommodated to the difference of objects that are thereby perceived. to the organick vision pass, And to the mind inflect the magick glass; Here born elate The manner in which the— upon etherial tides, The blythe illuminated glory glides, And on the beam the painted image rides object is conveyed to the eye—; Those images that still continuous flow, Effluviated around, above, below, True to the colour, distance, shape, and size, That from essential things perpetual rise, And obvious gratulate by whose second mediation the perceiving soul rejoices— our wondering eyes; Convey the bloom of nature's smiling scene beholding the elegance and beauty of nature—, The vernal landskip, and the watery main; The flocks that nibble but chiefly those animated beings who through life are susceptible of happiness— on the flowery lawn, The frisking lambkin, and the wanton fawn; The sight as every generous person increases his happiness by rejoicing in the happiness of others— how grateful to the social soul, That thus imbibes the blessings of the whole, Joys in their joy, while each inspires his breast With blessings multiplied from all that's blest! Nor less yon heights and as by means of this miraculous organ of sight, the beauties of earth are conspicuous, so in the first page of heaven expanded before us, to raise our hope to an assurance of further bliss. the unfolding heaven display, Its nightly twinkle, and its streaming day; The page impress'd conspicuous on the skies, A preface to the Book of Glory lies; We mount the steep, high born upon delight, While hope aspires beyond—and distances the sight. Thus heaven and earth, whom varying graces deck, In full proportions paint the visual speck; So awful did The wonderful texture of the aye— the Almighty's forming will, Amazing texture, and stupendous skill, The visionary net its retina (continued from the optick nerve) which is the proper organ of vision— and tunics weave its coats—, And the bright gem with lucid humours lave humours—; So gave the ball's collected ray to glow, And round the pupil arch'd his radiant bow and Iris, or circle surrounding the pupil, within which—; Full in a point the images of things are distinctly painted. unmeasured spaces lie, And worlds inclusive dwell within our eye. Yet useless was The infinitely wise adjustment of nature demonstrated; inasmuch as the eye had been useless without the object, both eye and object useless without light, the eye, the object, and the light, still useless without the medium of air for conveyance, and altogether as useless without. this textured wonder made, Were Nature, beauteous object! undisplay'd; Those, both as vain, the object, and the sight, Wrapt from the radiance of revealing light; As vain the bright illuminating beam, Unwafted by the medium's airy stream: Yet vain the textured eye, and object fair, The sunny lustre, and continuous air; Annull'd and blank this grand illustrious scene, All, all its grace, and lifeless glories, vain; Till from the Eternal The mind, which only can perceive. sprung this effluent Soul, Bless'd to inspect, and comprehend the whole! O whence, say whence this endless Beauty springs, This awful, dear, delightful depth of things? Whence but from Thee! Thou Great One! Thou Divine! Placid! and Mild! All Gracious! All Benign! Thou Nature's Parent! and Supreme Desire! How loved the offspring!—and how bless'd the Sire! How ever Bless'd! as blessings from Thee flow, And spread all bounteous on Thy works below: The reptile This paragraph was added as a hint of the following part, which chiefly treats of the arts and instincts of the inferior animal system: which subject, as it is less abstruse, so, it is probable, it will be more agreeable than any hitherto treated of., wreathed in many a wanton play; And insect, basking in the shine of day; The grazing quadruped, and plumy choir That earthly born to heavenly heights aspire; All species, form'd beneath the solar beam, That numberless adorn our future theme,— Fed in Thy bounty, fashion'd in Thy Skill, Cloath'd in Thy Love, instructed in Thy will, Safe in Thy conduct, their unerring guide, All-save the child of ignorance and pride— The paths of Beauty and of Truth pursue, And teach proud man those lectures which ensue! BOOK V. Thus Nature's frame, and Nature's GOD we sing, And trace even Life to its Eternal Spring— The Eternal Spring! whence streaming bounty flows; The Eternal Light! whence every radiance glows; The Eternal Height of indetermin'd space! The Eternal Depth of Condescending Grace! Supreme! and Midst! and Principle! and End! The Eternal Father! and the Eternal Friend! The Eternal Love! who bounds in every breast; The Eternal Bliss! whence every creature's blest— While man, even man, the lavish goodness shares, The wretch offends, and yet His Goodness spares; Still to the wayward wight indulgent turns, And kindly courts him to the peace he spurns; Emits the beam of intellectual light— Bright is the beam, and wilful is the night— While Nature amply spreads the illustrious scene, And renders all pretext of error vain: Unfolded wide her obvious pages lie, To win attention from the wandering eye; Full to convince us, to instruct us sage, Strict to reform, and beauteous to engage. Like Nature's law no eloquence persuades, The mute harangue our every sense invades; The apparent precepts of the Eternal Will, His every work, and every object fill; Round with our eyes The Deity necessarily inferred from the contemplation of every object— His revelation wheels, Our every touch his demonstration feels. And, O Supreme! whene'er we cease to know Thee, the sole Source, whence sense, and science flow! Then must all faculty, all knowledge fail, And more than monster o'er the man prevail. Not thus He gave our optic's vital glance, Amid omniscient art, to search for chance, Blind to the charms of Nature's beauteous frame; Nor made our organ vocal, to blaspheme: Not thus He will'd the creatures of his nod, And made the mortal, to unmake his GOD; Breathed on the globe, and brooded o'er the wave, And bid the wide obsequious world conceive: Spoke into being But more especially visible in the animate creation, so infinitely diversified in the several species and kinds of—, myriads, myriads rise, And with young transport gaze the novel skies; Glance from the surge fish—, beneath the surface scud, Or cleave enormous the reluctant flood; Or rowl vermicular reptiles— their wanton maze, And the bright path with wild meanders glaze; Frisk in the vale quadrupeds—, or o'er the mountains bound, Or in huge gambols shake the trembling ground; Swarm in the beam insects—; or spread the plumy sail and birds; as this diversity unites in one universal evidence of One Sole Operator—— The plume creates, and then directs the gale: While active gaiety, and aspect bright, In each expressive, sums up all delight. But whose unmeasured prose, memorial long! Or volubility of numerous song, Can Nature's infinite productions range, Or with her ever varying species change? Not the famed bard, in whose surviving page, Troy still shall stand, and fierce Pelides rage; Not this the Mantuan's rival muse could hope; Nor thou, sole object of my envy,—Pope! Then let the shoals of latent nations sleep, Safe in the medium of their native deep; Haply, when future beauteous scenes invite, Haply our line may draw those scenes to light. Mean while, earth's minim populace inspect, With just propriety of beauties deck'd; Consummate each Whose characteristic of infinite power and wisdom is equally conspicuous in all, since even the lowest can be derived from no less than the Highest; and, in that respect, the lowest, though apparently despicable, is most highly valuable, since the same Extensive Benignity condescends even to the—, adapted to its state, And highly in the lowest sphere complete. Sublime the theme, and claims the attentive ear, Well worth the song, since worth The Almighty's care; Since even the smallest from the Great One springs, Great and conspicuous in minutest things! The reptile first earth-worm, and has had a peculiar regard towards it—, how exquisitely form'd, With vital streams in the organization of its frame— thro' every organ warm'd! External round its wonderful apparatus for motion, by a most especial and accurate provision— the spiral muscle winds, And folding close the interior texture binds; Secure of limbs or needless wing he steers, And all one locomotive act appears: His rings with one elastic membrane bound, The prior circlet moves the obsequious round; The next, and next, its due obedience owes, And with successive undulation flows. The mediate glands With every other mean and method accommodated to its sphere of action; and conducing to the safety and perfection of its state., with unctuous juice replete, Their stores of lubricating guile secrete; Still opportune, with prompt emission flow, And slipping frustrate the deluded foe; When the stiff clod their little augers bore, And all the worm insinuates thro' the pore. Slow moving next The same infinite Wisdom operating ever equally, though variously, is no less admirable in the different apparatus for the snail's motion, as differently adapted to its different state and occasions—, with grave majestic pace, Tenacious Snails by a broad and strong skin on either side the belly, and the emission of a glutinous slime; by the assistance of which they adhere to any surface more firmly than they could do with claws or talons. their silent progress trace; Thro' foreign fields secure from exile roam, And sojourn safe beneath their native home. Their domes self-wreathed The advantage of their shells, which they form by a froth or petrifying juice, which they secreted from their body; and at any time repair a fracture or breach in their building, which serves them both for house and armour., each architect attend, With mansions lodge them, and with mail defend: But chief And which they close up during the winter, to shut out the inclemency of the weather, and also to prevent any consumption of the fluids; by which means they want no nourishment at a time that they cannot be readily provided., when each his wintery portal forms, And mocks secluded from incumbent storms; Till gates, unbarring with the vernal ray, Give all the secret hermitage to day; Then peeps the sage from his unfolding doors, And cautious heaven's ambiguous brow explores: Towards the four winds I have inserted this opinion of snails having eyes at the ends of their horns, rather in submission to authority, than that I am really persuaded it is so. However, they may, in a great measure, be said to see with their touch, which in this part is extremely sensible, and equally serves their purpose— four telescopes he bends, And on his own astrology depends; Assured he glides beneath the smiling calm, Bathes in the dew, and sips the morning balm; The peach this pampering epicure devours, And climbing on the topmost fruitage towers. Such have we cull'd and since the common earth-worm and snail (which seem the most despicable of all reptiles) are so curiously adorned, and provided in all respects, how amazing must the same conduct, care, and artifice be, through the several scenes of minute animalcules! who leave no place empty of suitable inhabitants, and are doubtless of greater consequence in nature, than our partial and narrow way of thinking may imagine. from nature's reptile scene, Least accurate of all the wondrous train, Who plunged recluse in silent caverns sleep; Or multipede, earth's leafy verdure creep; Or on the pool's new mantling surface play, And range a drop, as whales may range the sea: Or ply the rivulet with supple oars, And oft, amphibious, course the neighbouring shores; Or sheltering, quit the dank inclement sky, And condescend to lodge where princes lie; There tread the ceiling, an inverted floor, And from its precipice depend secure: Or who nor creep Such as grasshoppers, crickets, and frogs., nor fly, nor walk, nor swim, But claim new motion with peculiar limb, Successive spring with quick elastic bound, And thus transported pass the refluent ground. Or who all native Spiders, &amp;c. whose flights are owing to a thread of inconceivable fineness and levity, which they dart, on occasion, from their bodies, and which being buoyed up by the least breeze, bears off the animalcule to which it is annexed. vehicles despise, And buoy'd upon their own inventions rise; Shoot forth the twine, their light aerial guide, And mounting o'er the distant zenith ride. Or who a twofold Of this kind are beetles and lady-cows; and nothing can be more entertaining than to see them, by a surprizing machinery of little springs and hinges, erect the smooth covering of their backs, and unfolding their wings that were most neatly disposed within their cases, prepare for flight— apparatus share, Natives of earth, and habitants of air; Like warriors stride, oppress'd with shining mail, But furl'd, beneath, their silken pennons veil: Deceived our fellow reptile we admire, His bright endorsement, and compact attire, When lo! the latent springs of motion play, And rising lids disclose the rich inlay; The tissued wing its folded membrane frees, And with blithe quavers fans the gathering breeze; Elate towards heaven the beauteous wonder flies, And leaves the mortal wrapp'd in deep surprize. So when the Guide led Tobit's youthful heir, Elect, to win the seven times widow'd Fair, The angelic form, concealed in human guise, Deceived the search of his associate's eyes; Till swift each charm bursts forth like issuing flame, And circling rays confess his heavenly frame; The zodiac round his waste divinely turns, And waving radiance o'er his plumage burns: In awful transports rapt, the youth admires, While light from earth the dazzling shape aspires. O think But what is there in nature that is not equally surprizing? We are ashamed not to account for objects that are daily obvious to our senses; and yet every work of the Deity—, if superficial scenes amaze, And even the still familiar wonders please, These but the sketch in many respects, is to us as really incomprehensible as the Divine Operator; for who can give rule or measure to the works of an Infinite Artist? And if we only superficially behold, and reason from the qualities of things—, the garb, the veil of things, Whence all our depth of shallow science springs; Think, should this curtain were this veil at once laid aside, how insupportably conspicuous would the fullness of Infinite Wisdom and Essential Beauty appear; pouring on our weak and unequal senses! We should then be convinced of the equal folly and impiety of presumption on one side; or scepticism on the other: of pretending to know all things; or (because we know not all things) of inferring that nothing is to be known. Our reason indeed is not infallible; but neither is it useless: reason, throughout its sphere of knowledge, perceives a wisdom and art that is obvious, and inimitable; and hence cannot avoid to infer, that the same wisdom and art is universal; and that there must be One Sole Omnipresent and Adorable Artist. But when reason attempts a higher pitch, and forms to itself independent schemes of the courses of nature, or fitnesses of things; nothing can be more vain than such a dictating arrogance. That there is, and ever will be, a fitness and propriety in things, is evident even to reason; because reason perceives sufficient Wisdom and Goodness, to demonstrate that Wisdom and Goodness now are, and ever will be, the sole directing principles. But to say to what infinitely wise and good purposes such direction tends; to say how far, and in what particulars, the nature of such tendency may alter the appearance of fitness in things; so as to determine what now is, or hereafter may be fit, possible, or impossible; is generally as absurd as to attempt to grasp the universe in our hand, or circumscribe immensity with a carpenter's compass. Hence this one great truth is evident, that though our reason apprehends a propriety and fitness in the relations of many things and actions both natural and moral, yet as we cannot comprehend the whole of Infinite Wisdom— of Omniscience rise, Think of the sight! and think of the surprize! Scenes inconceivable, essential, new, Whelm'd on our soul, and lightning on our view!— How would the vain disputing wretches shrink, And shivering, wish they could no longer think; Reject each model, each reforming scheme, No longer dictate to the Grand Supreme, But waking, wonder whence they dared to dream! All is phænomenon there is doubtless a further design, and more latent fitness and beauty in things and their relations, than we can apprehend or are aware of: and as this fitness may be relative in respect of duration, and in respect of the difference between the present and future state of things; many things may now appear unfit and improper in our way of thinking, which in reality are most perfective of future infinitely wise and directing purposes, to which our notions are by no means adequate. What has been here offered in the way of hypothesis, is evidently rational; but when more nearly attended to, will admit of the highest demonstration: for either there is a present absolute fitness in things; or a fitness in futuro, that is, in prospect or tendency, and only relative here to what must be absolute hereafter. But if there were an absolute fitness in the present state of things, there could then be no change in any thing; since what is best can never change to better: but things do change, and must therefore have a present relative fitness, tending to, and productive of some future, absolute, and unchangeable fitness or perfection; to which this present relative fitness is by a moral, wise, and orderly necessity, precedent. The sum of all (which has so long and copiously employed the pens of the learned) is this,—First, That there is a present fitness or beauty sufficiently obvious in things, to demonstrate an Over ruling Wisdom.—Secondly, That this Over-ruling Wisdom, or God, now does, and ever will conduct all things for the best.—But, thirdly, Since things change, they cannot be now in their state of perfection.—Therefore, fourthly, There must be some other or future state, to which all things tend and are directed, for the final and unchangeable perfection of all things., and type on earth, Replete with sacred and mysterious birth, Deep from our search, exalted from our soar; And Reason's task is, only to Adore. Who that beholds If any thing in the preceding lines seems too much tinctured with mystery; I must beg leave to ask the enemies of mystery, were it not for repeated experience, whether every thing in nature would not appear a mystery? or, whether, when they contemplate a gnat or butterfly, &amp;c. they can perceive, by the bare light of nature or reason, the relation its present state and form bears to the several changes, states, and forms, through which it has passed, all in appearance as distinct as difference could make them?— the summer's glistering swarms, Ten thousand thousand gaily gilded forms, In volant dance of mix'd rotation play, Bask in the beam, and beautify the day; Who'd think these airy wantons so adorn, Were late his vile antipathy and scorn, Prone to the dust, or reptile thro' the mire, And ever thence unlikely to aspire? Or who with transient view or, whether, by contemplating an animalcule's egg, they can foresee that this will produce a maggot or caterpillar, &amp;c. that the maggot or caterpillar will build its own sepulchre; (and having continued therein for a certain term, in an apparent state of mortality, and laid aside its former limbs and organized members) will at length break through the gates of death, and put on a state and form of higher beauty and perfection, than could enter into any heart to conceive, or could have employed the dreams of the deepest philosopher?—, beholding, loaths Those crawling sects, whom vilest semblance cloaths; Who, with corruption, hold their kindred state, As by contempt, or negligence of fate; Could think, that such, revers'd by wondrous doom, Sublimer powers and brighter forms assume; From death, their future happier life derive, And tho' apparently entomb'd, revive; Chang'd, thro' amazing transmigration rise, And wing the regions of unwonted skies; So late depress'd, contemptible on earth, Now elevate to heaven by second birth? No fictions here How would the refined reasoners of the present age argue against the absurdity and impossibility of such unaccountable contradictions, were not the facts too obvious to sense and perpetual experience to be disputed? facts altogether as wonderful, though not so fabulous, as the— to willing fraud invite, Led by the marvellous, absurd delight; No golden ass marvellous metamorphoses in romance; or—, no tale Arabians feign; Nor flitting forms those of Ovid, in his tales of— of Naso's magic strain, Deucalion's progeny Deucalion and Pyrrha repeopling the world after the flood— of native stone, Or armies from of Cadmus sowing the serpent's teeth, from whence sprung armed men— Cadmean harvests grown; With many a wanton and fantastic dream, The lawrel of Daphne—, mulberry Pyramus and Thisbe—, and bashful stream Arethusa—; Arachne shrunk Arachne turned into a spider— beneath Tritonia's rage; Tithonus chang'd and Tithonus to a grasshopper. and garrulous with age. Not such mutations deck the chaster song, Adorn'd with Nature, and with Truth made strong; No debt to fable, or to fancy due, And only wondrous facts reveal'd to view. Tho' numberless these insect tribes of air, Tho' numberless each tribe and species fair, Who wing the noon, and brighten in the blaze, Innumerous as the sands which bend the seas; These have their organs However merry or hyperbolical these assertions may appear, in respect of creatures, whom our ignorance, or want of inspection, have rendered despicable to us; there is nothing more certain, than that they have more trades and utensils than are here specified. The inimitable fineness, and mathematical proportion of their works, is a double demonstration of their skill, and the accuracy of their instruments; to which the most exquisite manufacture of man may bear just such relation, as a cumbrous windmill to the neatest tool or machine in a watchmaker's shop—, arts, and arms, and tools, And functions exercised by various rules; The saw, axe, auger, trowel, piercer, drill; The neat alembick, and nectareous still: Their peaceful hours the loom and distaff know; But war, the force and fury of the foe, The spear, the fauchion, and the martial mail, And artful stratagem where strength may fail. Each tribe peculiar occupations claim, Peculiar beauties deck each varying frame; Attire and food peculiar are assigned, And means to propagate their varying kind. Each as reflecting No less admirable is their reason, precaution, instinct, or what you please to call their care and skill, in the disposition of their eggs or embryo; not scattered at random, but situated agreeable to the nature of every species, in such places, and among such supplies of nutriment, as will alone contribute to the perfection, and be acceptable to the several appetites of their young ones— on their primal state, Or fraught with scientific craft innate, With conscious skill their oval embryon shed, Where native first their infancy was fed: Or on some vegetating foliage if on the leaves of vegetables, then situated and glued in such a manner, as not to be subject to the influence of winds or rain— glued; Or o'er the flood they spread their future brood; A slender cord For the mathematical order in which gnats dispose their eggs or sperm on the water, vide Derham's Phys. Theology, fig. IX. and X.— the floating jelly binds, Eludes the wave, and mocks the warring winds; O'er this their sperm in spiral order lies, And pearls in living ranges greet our eyes. In firmest oak And so, in like manner, the various receptacles which are suitable to the sperm of each species, are almost infinite; and yet the art and prophetic precaution, which, by a several and distinct method, is peculiar to each, carries the air of as much wisdom and importance, as if the harmony and connection of nature had depended on the regular and uniform propagation of every several sect or species— they scoop a spacious tomb, And lay their embryo in the spurious womb: Some flowers, some fruit, some gems, or blossoms chuse, And confident their darling hopes infuse; While some their eggs in ranker carnage lay, And to their young adapt the future prey. Mean time the sun The generality of these wonderful animals having thus performed all the requisites, take no further care for their young; but (like the ostrich, who covers her eggs with the sands) they are sensible their duty is over, and leave the rest to the clemency of the seasons, and the sufficiency of nature, who, in these instances, renders all further caution needless— his fostering warmth bequeaths, Each tepid air its motive influence breaths, Mysterious springs the wavering life supply, And quickning births unconscious motion try; Mature their slender fences they disown, And break at once into a world unknown. All by their dam's prophetic care receive Whate'er peculiar indigence can crave: Profuse at hand and alone furnishes and provides for all, with a more than parental care and tenderness— the plenteous table's spread, And various appetites are aptly fed. Nor less each organ But among all the instances of a universal and benign Providence, nothing can be more signal or expressive of the extensive Goodness than the occasional and temporary parts and organs of many animals in their changeable state, still accommodated, suited, and adapted with the most circumstantial and minute exactness to the immediate manner and convenience of their existence; and yet as immediately shifted and thrown aside upon the animal's commencing a new state and scene of action, and a sett of limbs and garniture furnished de novo, as it were a new suit of clothes fitted and contrived agreeable to every season. This observation may have escaped many, who thought it beneath them to inquire into the oeconomy of these minute animals; but it is obvious to all persons in the tadpole estate of frogs, who, in their minority, are provided with a fin-like tail, which seems to constitute the chief part of their bulk, but drops off as the growing limbs extend, and gives notice that its continuance is superfluous and unnecessary. Though the state and conduct of these animals, as here described, may be looked on as allegorical, and representative of the present state of man and his future hopes; yet the case with them is already real, and their change and resurrection most evident to sense. The moment they are hatched— suits each place of birth, Finn'd in the flood, or reptile o'er the earth; Each organ, apt to each precarious state, As for eternity designed complete. Thus nurs'd they set about pampering their little carcases, without any other apparent thought or concern—, these inconsiderate wretches grow, Take all as due, still thoughtless that they owe. When lo within a certain period of time, they conceive a disrelish to all past enjoyment, and by a profound reverie, seem, as it were, studious of some great event. During this interval, new judgments are acquired, and resolutions taken; they foresee and rejoice at their approaching mortality—! strange tidings prompt each secret breast, And whisper wonders not to be exprest; Each owns his error in his later cares, And for the new unthought of world prepares: New views, new tastes, new judgments are acquired, And all now loath delights so late admired. In confidence they frame and prepare the mansions of death with the same chearful alacrity and elegance, as a bridal chamber, or wedding garment the solemn shroud they weave, Or build the tomb, or dig the deadly grave; Intrepid there resign their parting breath, And give their former shape here the texture of their former organs suffers an actual dissolution; and whatever the principle of regeneration be, a new, and, in appearance, a quite different creature, is conceived from the remains of the old one— the spoils of death; But reconceived as in a second womb, Thro' metamorphoses, new forms assume: On death their true exalted life depends, Commencing there, where seemingly it ends. The fullness now their consummation is at hand— of circling time arrives; Each from the long, the mortal sleep revives; The tombs pour forth their sepulchres give way; they spring forth, and wing the air in inexpressible beauty and magnificence. their renovated dead, And, like a dream, all former scenes are fled. But O! what terms expressive may relate The change, the splendor of their new form'd state? Their texture Insecta non videntur nervos habere, nec ossa, nec spinas, nec cartilaginem, nec pinguia, nec carnes, nec crustam quidem fragilem, ut quædam marina, nec quæ jure dicatur cutis: sed mediæ cujusdam inter omnia hæc naturæ corpus. Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. xi. cap. 4. nor composed of filmy skin, Of cumbrous flesh without, or bone within, But something than corporeal more refined, And agile as their blithe informing mind. In every eye These creatures, though, in appearance, they have but two eyes, are really multocular. Every lens (of which there are an innumerable number) is a distinct eye, which has a branch of the optic nerve ministring to it; by which provision no object escapes them; they at once view almost all round them; and as their eyes are immovable, this multiplicity amply supplies the absence of the motory nerves. ten thousand brilliants blaze, And living pearls the vast horizon gaze; Gemm'd o'er their heads the mines of India gleam, And heaven's own wardrobe has array'd their frame; Each spangled back bright sprinkling specks adorn, Each plume imbibes the rosy tinctured morn; Spread on each wing the florid seasons glow, Shaded and verg'd with the celestial bow, Where colours blend an ever varying dye, And wanton in their gay exchanges vie. Not all the glitter fops and fair ones prize, The pride of fools, and pity of the wise; Not all the shew and mockery of state, The little, low, fine follies of the great; Not all the wealth which eastern pageants wore, What still our idolizing worlds adore; Can boast the least inimitable grace, Which decks profusive this illustrious race. Hence might the song luxuriant range around, Or plunge the nether ocean's dread profound; There mete Leviathan's enormous length, Adorn'd with terrors, and unmatch'd in strength, The sea his pool of pastime when he bathes, And tempests issue while his nostril breathes. See where Behemoth's pillar'd fabric stands! His shade extensive cools the distant lands; Encamp'd, an army on his shoulder lies, And o'er his back proud citadels arise. But vain those gifts Cujus causa videtur cuncta alia genuisse Natura, magna &amp; sæva mercede contra tanta sua munera; ut non sit satis æstimare, parens melior homini, an tristior noverca fuerit—, those graces to relate, Which all perceive, and envy deems complete. “O Nature!” cries the wretch of human birth, “O why a step-dame to this lord of earth? “To brutes indulgent Ante omnia unum animantium cunctorum, alienis velat opibus: cæteris variè tegumenta tribuit; testas, cortices, coria, spinas, villos, setas, pilos, plumam, pennas, squamas, vellera. Truncos etiam arboresque cortice, interdum gemino, a frigoribus &amp; calore tutata est. Hominem tantum nudum, &amp; in nuda humo, natali die abjicit ad vagitus statim &amp; ploratum, nullumque tot animalium aliud ad lacrymas, &amp; has protinus vitæ principio. Plin. Nat. Hist. L. VII. Prœm. bends thy partial care, “While just complainings fill our natal air. “Helpless, uncloathed, the pride of nature lies, “And Heaven relentless hears his viceroy's cries. “O wherefore not with native bounties bless'd, “Nor thus in humble poor dependance dress'd? “Give me the self-born garb, the bark of trees, “The downy feather, and the wintry fleece; “The crocodile's invulnerable scale, “Or the firm tortoise's impervious mail; “The strength of elephants, the rein deer's speed, “Fleet and elastic as the bounding steed; “The peacock's state of gorgeous plumage add, “Gay as the dove in golden verdure clad; “Give me the scent of each sagacious hound, “The lynx's eye, and linnet's warbling sound; “The soaring wing and steerage of the crane, “And spare the toil and dangers of the main: “O why of these thy bounteous goods bereft, “And only to interior Reason left? “There, there alone, I bless thy kind decree; “Nor cause of grief, or emulation see.” Thus needless prayers for needless gifts are sent, And man is, only in his wants, content; Indocile where he needs instruction most, His only error is his only boast. Ye self-sufficient sons of reasoning pride Too wise to take Omniscience for your guide, Those rules from insects, birds, and brutes discern, Which from the Maker you disdain to learn!— The social friendship, and the firm ally, The filial sanctitude, and nuptial tie, Patience in want, and faith to persevere, The endearing sentiment, and tender care, Courage o'er private interest to prevail, And die all Decii for the public weal. Nor less for geometric schemes renown'd, And skill'd in arts and sciences profound, Their textured webs with matchless craft surprize, Their buildings in amazing structures rise: To them each clime, and longitude is known, Each finds a chart and compass of his own; They judge the influence of every star, And calculate the seasons from afar; Thro' devious air pursue the certain way, Nor ever from the Conscious Dictate stray. BOOK VI. “Ye human offsprings of distinguish'd birth, “So justly substituted lords of earth; “Who boast the seal of highest heaven impress'd, “Thence with supremacy of reason bless'd, “Attend the song, and vindicate your claim! “Recall your ancestry of antique fame, “Prime artizans of each sagacious craft, “The curious model, or designing draft, “All talents technical for each device, “The skilful fabrick, and the texture nice! “Or, if ye pride in science more refined, “Judicial product of the studious mind, “The scheme politic, or the moral plan, “To form the conduct, or the heart of man; “Attend the depth of maxims which ensue, “More than e'er Solon, or great Cecil knew; “The moral, with diviner precepts fraught, “Than stories, or than eastern magi taught.” First let the botanist his art forego, And o'er the mountain trace the Cretan Doe: Behold the critic stand with curious mien, And cull the virtues of the various green, Secrete her foliage from the noxious weed, And conscious of her skill securely feed! Where did this Sylvan Leach her lore acquire, From Æsculapius, or his Radiant Sire? When to her panting flank the weapon flies, And deep within the feather'd mischief lies, She seeks the well known medicine of the plain, Nor yet despairs where human art were vain; Mild thro' her frame the sovereign balsams glide, And the keen shaft falls guiltless from her side. Ye wanderers of the faithless main! relate, Whose science then averts impending fate, When haply on the distant climate thrown, Ye view strange objects, and a world unknown; Each tree uncouth, with foreign fruitage crown'd, And unacquainted plenty blooming round: But who shall dare with rash adventurous hand, To pluck the bane of a suspected land? Half famish'd they devour with wistful eyes; But fear dissuades to tempt the dangerous prize: Yet should they spy, amid the fruitful brake, The skilful trace of some luxurious beak, With birds their elegant repast they share, And bless the learn'd inhabitants of air. Bear, bear my song, ye raptures of the mind! Convey your bard thro' Nature unconfined, Licentious in the search of wisdom range, Plunge in the depth, and wanton in the change; Waft me to Tempe, and her flowery dale, Born on the wings of every tuneful gale; Amid the wild profusions let me stray, And share with Bees the virtues of the day. Soon as the matin glory gilds the skies, Behold the little Virtuosi rise! Blithe for the task, they preen their early wing, And forth to each appointed labour spring. Now Nature boon exhales the morning steam, And glows and opens to the welcome beam; The vivid tribes amid the fragrance fly, And every art, and every business ply. Each chymist now his subtle trunk unsheathes, Where, from the flower, the treasured odour breathes; Here sip the liquid, here select the gum, And o'er the bloom with quivering membrane hum. Still with judicious scrutiny they pry, Where lodg'd the prime essential juices lie; Each luscious vegetation wide explore, Plunder the spring of every vital store: The dainty suckle, and the fragrant thyme, By chymical reduction, they sublime; Their sweets with bland attempering suction strain, And, curious, thro' their neat alembicks drain; Imbibed recluse, the pure secretions glide, And vital warmth concocts the ambrosial tide. Inimitable Art! do thou atone The long lost labours of the Latent Stone; Tho' the Five Principles so oft transpire, Fined, and refined, amid the torturing fire. Like issue should the daring chymist see, Vain imitator of the curious Bee, Nor arts improved thro' ages once produce A single drachm of this delicious juice. Your's then, industrious traders! is the toil, And man's proud science is alone to spoil. “Sweet's the repast where pains have spread the board, “And deep the fund incessant labours hoard; “A friendly arm makes every burden light; “And weakness, knit by union, turns to might.” Hail happy tribes! illustrious people hail! Whose forms minute such sacred maxims veil; In whose just conduct, framed by wondrous plan, We read revers'd each polity of man. Who first in council form'd your embryon state? Who rose a patriot in the deep debate? Greatly proposed to reconcile extremes, And weave in unity opposing schemes? From fears inferr'd just reason of defence, And from self-interest rais'd a publick sense; Then pois'd his project with transposing scale, And from the publick, shew'd the private weal? Whence aptly summ'd, these politicians draw The trust of power, and sanctitude of law; Power in dispensing benefits employ'd, And healing laws, not suffer'd, but enjoy'd. The members, hence unanimous, combine To prop that throne, on which the laws recline; The law's protected even for private ends, Whereon each individual's right depends; Each individual's right by union grows, And one full tide for every member flows; Each member as the whole communion great, Back'd by the powers of a defending state; The state by mutual benefits secure, And in the might of every member sure! The publick thus each private end pursues; Each in the publick drowns all private views: By social commerce and exchange they live, Assist supported, and receiving give. High on her throne, the bright Imperial Queen Gives the prime movement to the state machine: She, in the subject, sees the duteous child; She, the true parent, as the regent mild, With princely grace invested sits elate, Informs their conduct, and directs the state. Around, the drones who form her courtly train, Bask in the rays of her auspicious reign; Beneath, the sage consulting peers repair, And breathe the virtues of their prince's care; Debating, cultivate the publick cause, And wide dispense the benefit of laws. So have I seen, when breathing organs blow, One board sonorous fill the various row; The pipes divide the unity of sound, And spread the charms of symphony around. The clustering populace obsequious wait, Or speed the different orders of the state; Here greet the labourer on the toilsome way, And to the load their friendly shoulder lay; Or frequent at the busy gate arrive, And fill with amber-sweets their fragrant hive; Or seek repairs to close the fractured cell; Or shut the waxen wombs where embryos dwell; The caterers prompt, a frugal portion deal, And give to diligence a hasty meal; In each appointed province all proceed, And neatest order weds the swiftest speed; Dispatch flies various on ten thousand wings, And joy throughout the gladsome region rings. Distinctly canton'd is their spacious dome: Here infants throb within the quickening comb; Here vacant seats invite to sweet repose, And here the tide of balmy nectar flows; While here their frugal reservoirs remain, And not one act of this republick's vain. As oft the North, or Gallia's fruitful coast, Poured forth their sons, a wide superfluous host! To distant climes the banded legions stray'd, And many a plan of future empire laid; Like powers these wise prolifick people send, And o'er the globe their colonies extend. When swarms tumultuous claim an ampler space, And thro' the straitening citadel increase, An edict issued in this grand extreme, Proclaims the mandate of the power supreme. Then exiled crouds abjure their native home, And sad, in search of foreign mansions roam; A youthful empress guides their airy clan, And wheels and shoots illustrious from the van. Fatigued at length, they wish some calm retreat, The rural settlement, and peaceful state; When man presents his hospitable snare, And wins their confidence with traitorous care. Suspicion ever flies a generous breast— Betrayed, each enters an unwary guest; Here every form of ancient maxim trace, And emulate the glories of their race. As when from Tyre imperial Dido fled, And o'er the main her future nation led; Then staid her host on Afric's meted land, And in strait bounds a mighty empire plann'd: So works this rival of the Tyrian Queen; So founds and models with assiduous mien; Instructs with little to be truly great, And in small limits forms a mighty state. Intent, she wills her artists to attend, And from the zenith bids her towers descend: Nor like to man's, the aerial structures rise; But point to earth, their base amid the skies. Swift for the task the ready builders part, Each band assigned to each peculiar art; A troop of chymists scour the neighbouring field, While servile tribes the cull'd materials wield, With tempering feet the laboured cement tread, And ductile now its waxen foliage spread. The geometricians judge the deep design, Direct the compass, and extend the line; They sum their numbers, provident of space, And suit each edifice with answering grace. Now first appears the rough proportion'd frame, Rough in the draught, but perfect in the scheme; When lo! each little Archimedes nigh, Metes every angle with judicious eye; Adjusts the centering cones with skill profound, And forms the curious hexagon around. The cells indors'd with double range adhere, Knit on the sides, and guarded on the rear; Nought of itself, with circling chambers bound, Each cell is form'd, to form the cells around; While each still gives what each alike demands, And but supported by supporting stands; Jointly transferring, and transferr'd exists; And, as by magick union, all subsists. Amazing elegance! transcendent art! Contrived at once to borrow, and impart; In action notable, as council great, Their fabricks rise, just emblems of their state. Nor be the Wasp exclusive of our lays; Tho' in a foe, still merit claims its praise, Claims the revealing song, and claims the light, Tho' long conceal'd in all obscuring night. For deep these subterranean tribes retire, Nor work like man, that mortals may admire; In earth's dark womb their pompous structures rise, Worthy the sight of Heaven's all-seeing Eyes; While they recluse, o'er nether kingdoms reign, And wrapt as in a little world remain. Around this world a waxen vault extends, And wide like yon enfolding concave bends; Magnifick cupola! on either hand, Unfolded, two mysterious portals stand, Emblems of human life, precarious state, At entrance born, and dying in retreat. Thousands within retiring taste repose; Or thro' the streets the busy concourse flows: Yet not as ours their costly pavements spread, But high on terrasses and towers they tread, With which not Roman aqueducts may vie, Not the famed gardens pendant from the sky: Here cities piled o'er cities may be seen, And sumptuous intervals displayed between, Where columns each proud architrave support, And form the pomp of many an ample court; The weight thro' ten successive stories bear, And to the top the incumbent fabricks rear. So have I seen in all the pride of shew, Some splendid theatre divide below, With charms of gay machinery surprize, Scenes over scenes, and stage on stage arise, Lost in the glory of descending skies. Not so the multipede Aurelias dwell, But form, sole architects, the pensive cell; Like Seers of old, they seek some lonely seat, And from the vain the busy world retreat; Here fondly form a structure of their own, And bind the vault of solitary stone; Or clay, or timber, oft attempering, mould, And round their form the ductile mansion fold; Or in peculiar occupations skill'd, A wondrous dome of silken fabrick build: No debt to foreign implements they owe, But from themselves the mantling tissues flow; Themselves the gorgeous canopy they spread, Themselves the loom, the distaff, and the thread— The thread as famed Arachne's texture fine, When thwart the morn she darts her floating line, Or spins the scheme of implicated wiles, And o'er her great Newtonian rival smiles; Reveals the deep ænigma of his trade, And squares the circle in the vernal glade; The sportive plans of matchless art displays, While round, and round, the dexterous wanton plays. How might the song with endless rapture pry, Secluded deep where latent nations lie, And scared from man, a mighty hunter, fly? He follows panting with a savage joy, Rapt in his favourite transport to destroy: To man, even man becomes a mutual prey; No gain can satiate, and no limits stay; Down the dread depths his boundless lucre dives; Warr'd on himself, with passion passion strives. Fly him, ye rangers of the rolling flood! Fly him, ye songsters of the warbling wood! Ye dwellers subterrene, the tyrant fly! And safe in your remote asylums lie, Where mice, innoxious cottagers, remain, Meek in the covert of the flowery plain; Recluse, their cautious hermitage explore, And treasure provident the wintery store. With kindred crafts, deep-mining burroughs work, And sunk amid Dædalean labyrinths lurk; Their various habitation nightly change, And thro' a length of mazed apartments range. The Beaver too, great architect! immured, With his associate train retires secured; Their wary mansion elegantly stands, Where the smooth stream or smiling lake expands, Whose gentle wave in friendly visit glides, And swells the tenement with grateful tides. Two posterns gape with deep deceit below, And o'er the pass fair mantling waters flow; Evasive whence, they scape the dangerous train, Or wide expatiate on the yielding plain; Thro' trading currents sail to distant shores, Or homeward laden with returning stores. Laborious here, they hew the sounding wood, And lift the prize triumphant o'er the flood; Here, lightly some vimineous burdens bear, Or jointly here the ponderous rafter share; Spread o'er their tails, they waft the temper'd clay, And deep, and broad, their firm foundations lay; Assign each chamber its commodious size, Till rooms o'er rooms and trodden ceilings rise; Their tail the trowel, as adorning train, Their teeth the saw, the chissel, and the plane. While ardent Sirius shoots a thirsty ray, And Autumn yet withholds retreating day, They range at large, and gambol thro' the stream, Frisk on the beach, or batten in the beam; Or Nature's bounteous vegetation taste, And opportune indulge the transient feast. But when pale Phosphor points the morning gale, Curls on the wave and chills along the vale, Domestick cares their conscious breast employ; The frolick hours and luscious banquets cloy; Intent they furnish the prophetick hoard, And pile the treasures of their homely board, With friendship's charm beguile the sullen year, And barter luxury for social cheer. For them Astrea holds the impartial scale, Her frugal hands unenvied portions deal; Health quaffs satiety from Nature's bowl; Peace gives the constant banquet of the soul; High in the midst chaste Temperance is crown'd, And Time leads on the smiling Hours around. Thou awful Depth of Wisdom unexplored! Thou Height, where never human fancy soared! Supreme Irradiance! speed the distant ray, Far speed the dawn of thy internal day; And O! if such, inform the favourite line, And be the praise as inspiration thine! Say! when the nest thy little Halcyons form, Brood on the wave, and mock the threatening storm; Who quells the rage of thy reluctant main, Or o'er thy winter throws a lordly rein? Lulls the rock'd mansion on the slumbering tide, And bids the care of guardian depths subside? Till, volatile, the new fledg'd infants rise; The surge mounts free, and breaks upon the skies. Eternal! thine is every round of time, The circling season, and the varying clime; Thine! every dictate of the conscious breast; Thine! every texture of the genial nest, The oval embryon, and the fostering ray; And Thine the life that struggles into day! To Thee thy callow importuners cry, Gracious thy Ear, and bounteous thy Supply; Till the flown choirs the revel consort raise, And hymn to Heaven the rhapsody of praise! Dispers'd thro' every copse, or marshy plain, Where haunts the woodcock, or the annual crane, Where else encamp'd the feather'd legions spread, Or bathe incumbent on their oozy bed, The brimming lake Thy Smiling Presence fills, And waves the banners of a thousand hills. Thou speed'st the summons of Thy Warning Voice; Wing'd at Thy Word, the distant troops rejoice, From every quarter scour the fields of air, And to the general rendezvous repair: Each from the mingled rout disparting turns, And with the love of kindred plumage burns: Thy Potent Will instinctive bosoms feel, And here arranging semilunar, wheel; Or marshall'd here the painted rhomb display, Or point the wedge that cleaves the aerial way: Uplifted on Thy Wafting Breath they rise; Thou pavest the regions of the pathless skies, Thro' boundless tracts support'st the journey'd host, And point'st the voyage to the certain coast; Thou the sure Compass, and the Sea they sail, The Chart, the Port, the Steerage, and the Gale! Thus thro' the maze of Thy Eternal Round, Thro' yon steep heaven, and nether gulphs profound, The dusky planet, and the lucid sphere, Earth's ponderous ball, and soft enfolding air, The fish who glance or tempest thro' the main, The beasts who trip or thunder o'er the plain, The reptile wreathing in the wanton ring, The bird high wafted on the towering wing, All, all from Thee, Sole Cause Essential! tend, Thence flow effusive, thither centering end; The bliss of Providential Vision share, And the least atom claims peculiar care! Yet e'er material entity begun, Or from the Vast this Universe was won; While finitude e'erwhile was unconfined, Nor space grew relative, to form assigned; Thou didst thy own Eternal Now sustain, And space was swallow'd in thy boundless main; Thyself the filler of thy own abyss, Thyself the Great Eternity of Bliss! All When, and Where, in Thee imbosom'd lay, The blaze of majesty, and self born day; No void was found, where Endless Beauty beamed; No darkness, where Essential Glory flamed; No want, no solitude, where Thou wer't blest, And in Thyself the unbounded whole possest. Of Reason Thou the co-eternal cause, Thyself all Reason, and thy Will all Laws; All-reasoning Will with powerful Wisdom fraught! Thy Wisdom, one unchanging endless thought, Where all potential natures were survey'd, And even in pre-existence lay display'd— All, all—things past—now present—yet to be, Great Intellect! were present all to Thee; While Thou sole Infinite Essential reign'd, And of finites the Infinity contain'd, Ideal entities in One Supreme, Distinguish'd endless, yet with Thee the same, Thy Power their essence, and thy Will their claim. Whence—at Thy Word, worlds caught the potent sound, And into being leapt this wondrous round. Pois'd on Thy Will the universal hung; Attraction to its Central Magnet clung; Thy spacious grasp the mighty convex closed; Soft on Thy Care incumbent worlds reposed: Within, throughout, no Second Cause presides, And One Sole Hand the mazed volution guides! Hence Endless Good, hence Endless Order springs; Hence that importance in minutest things; And endless hence Dependence must endure, Blest in his Will, and in his Power secure! JERUSALEM DELIVERED; AN EPIC POEM: Translated from the ITALIAN OF TORQUATO TASSO. PRINTED MDCCXXXVIII. BOOK I. Of arms, devote to Heaven's Eternal King; Of sainted hosts the sacred Chief I sing, Who freed that tomb, to infidels a prey, Where once the Lord for all the living lay: Alike, his might and conduct claim applause; And much he suffer'd in the glorious cause: In vain infernal fury raised alarms, And half the world opposed contending arms; Sedition, ruled, beneath his sceptre lay, Foes learn'd to fear, and rebels to obey: So Heaven would crown its Hero with success, And Virtue triumph'd in the power to bless. O muse! whom mortal trophy would prophane, And thy chaste brow with fading laurel stain; While circling glories round thy temples play, And circling Angels hymn the eternal lay, O! breathe celestial ardours to my breast, Inspire the song, to Albion's Prince addrest; And pardon fiction mix'd with Truths Divine, Or arts to please which, goddess, are not thine! Well dost thou know the purport of my song, Tho' drest to charm, with secret virtue strong; While veil'd, beneath the verse the moral lies, And captivates the soul with kind disguise. His bitter thus the friendly Leech conceals, And with the fraud of latent medicine heals: To the sick taste he promises delight, And obvious sweets the infant lip invite; Health, ambush'd, in the potion is imbibed, For man must even to happiness be bribed. SIX suns had now their annual journey run, And seen the war that with the first begun; Still in his cause Messiah's hosts engage, And eastward bid the kindling combat rage. Antioch, and Nice, were now the victor's prize, Or won by storm, or captive by surprise: In vain all Asia rises to repel, Beneath their force unnumber'd Persians fell; And last Tortosa vanquish'd, they retire, Till war shall with returning spring respire. Scarce winter, warm'd before the golden ray, Restored the battle with the lengthening day, When GOD, self rais'd from his eternal throne, Sublime o'er Heaven's high Empyrean shone. Awed from his seat, tho' patent to his view, The rolling universe holds distance due: He looks; unnumber'd worlds before him lie, And nature lives collected in his eye. To Syria, on the Christian peers intent, All-piercing the Divine Perception bent; Where Godfrey stood, conspicuous in his sight, Above the princes eminently bright: Nor wealth allures him, nor ambition charms, But faith refines, and heavenly ardour arms; While zeal alone his placid bosom fires, And with the warrior all the saint conspires. Not such the thoughts that Heaven in Baldwin spied, From virtue alien, tho' by blood allied; Ambitious phantasms haunt his idle brain, And pride still prompts him to be greatly vain. With silent anguish Tancred stood opprest, While love, fond passion, languish'd in his breast. But Boemond's cares on Antioch's glory wait, And model in his mind her new form'd state; While the great Chief, late terrible in arms, With arts of peace and social conduct charms, At once of earth and heaven asserts the cause, Instructs with piety, and forms with laws. Rinaldo then, to war and nature new, Gave all his brave, his open soul to view; Untamed that restless bosom wish'd the fight, And circling perils gave his eyes delight: Wisdom and fame, but fame the most refined, By turns prevail'd, and fired, or form'd his mind; While he on Guelpho, sage instructor, hung, And caught the maxims falling from his tongue. This saw the Deity—through every breast, Each latent inclination lay confest; Then call'd, and from the bright angelic round, Forth issued Gabriel to the sacred sound; He, of the prime celestial splendors came, Obsequious to the will of Heaven's Supreme: Gracious to man the social spirit stands, To saints the messenger of blest commands; Thence, breathes the cordial incense to his King, And wafts their vows on his returning wing. (Expressive then the Inutterable Name) “To Godfrey his Creator's Will proclaim— “Ask, wherefore are my Sion's bonds untied? “The hero's sword why dormant at his side? “To council bid him cite each Christian peer, “Reprove the tardy, and the valiant cheer: “Him I elect, superior in his sway; “And let his rivals, and the world obey. Nor now Heaven's Flaming Minister delays; He heard with transport, and with speed obeys: Air organized his casual limbs composed, Attempering radiance round his essence closed; A human form the dazzling shape display'd, But in the majesty of Heaven array'd; While youth smiled o'er him with celestial grace, And beamy ringlets wanton'd round his face. He spread for flight his many tinctured wings, And light from Heaven's high firmament he springs: All feather'd as the darting shaft he flies, Cuts the bright steep, and cleaves the yielding skies, Divides the sphere of many a shining star, And sends the coming glory from afar; Then stands on Lebanon reveal'd to view, And shakes his plumes bedropp'd with morning dew. Now half appear'd the horizontal sun, And west, and east, with equal glory shone; There shed his evening, here his morning ray, And gave to different worlds dividual day— When wing'd from Lebanon's aspiring head, The angelic message to Tortosa sped, What time the Duke his orizons addrest And breathed to Heaven the rapture of his breast: In usher'd graceful with the morning beam, A brighter morn the dazzling Angel came; And placid, to the much admiring man, The bright, the social Intellect began. “Attend, thou favour'd of Supreme Decree! “Thus sends the Deity, and sends to thee— “In Bulloign's breast what kindling zeal should glow, “What fires impel him forceful on the foe? “When Sion calls, when listening Heaven commands, “And consecrates her cause in Godfrey's hands, “'Tis thine to vindicate her just complaints, “To strike the shackles from her captive saints; “'Tis thine to summon every Christian peer, “Reprove the tardy, and the valiant cheer; “Their general thou, superior in thy sway— “GOD so appoints, and mortals must obey. He ceas'd; and lessening from the hero's view, Back to his native Heaven the Brightness flew: Nor Godfrey yet supports excess of light, New to the shape, and dizzied at the sight; Not the wide blaze his darkling eye sustains, And chillness thrill'd unwonted through his veins. But soon he calls the vision to his mind, And ponders on the glorious charge assigned; Fresh to his soul the high behest returns, And with redoubled zeal his bosom burns: Nor yet, that Heaven preferr'd its warrior saint, Did pride dilate him, or ambition taint; But through Almighty Will, his will aspires, As the spark mounts amid the kindling fires. Strait where they lay, each chieftain he invites; Now mild requires, and now by mandate cites: Dispatch'd around his posting envoys fly, And prayers are mix'd with counsels to comply. Persuasive here, the gallant soul he charms; But here provokes, and here impels to arms; Here blows the slumbering virtue to a flame, And breathes throughout the noble thirst of fame. Such Godfrey's conduct, nor his conduct vain; Each comes, attended by his warlike train: Tortosa but a scant reception yields, And tented armies throng the neighbouring fields. All awful, to consult the peers repair; Save Boemond, each, majestic, fills his chair; When graceful, to the senate Godfrey rose, And deep the stream of elocution flows. “Ye warriors! Heaven-elected, to restore “The Sacred Faith of Him those Heavens adore; “Preserv'd for this through many a fearful day, “The foreign climate, and the deadly fray, “Well may ye rush, thus arm'd, upon the foe, “And fight secure where Heaven averts the blow. “Nor vain I deem the purchase of your toil, “The vanquish'd province, and the glorious spoil; “Since trophies through reforming nations rise, “And bear Christ's name triumphant to the skies. “But not for this, we left our native place, “The known endearment, and the chaste embrace; “Each social sweet for distant battle chang'd, “And wandering, through the faithless ocean rang'd: “For this, an end unequal to your arms, “Nor bleeds the combat, nor the conquest charms; “Nor such the prize your matchless labours claim, “Barbarian kingdoms, and ignoble fame. “Was not the scope of our united powers “To scale the steep of Sion's hallow'd towers? “High o'er her walls to force resistless way? “Deep on her dungeons pour the long lost day? “To lift Oppression from her house of pain, “Snap the vile yoke, and burst the pagan chain? “Restore to Piety her sacred seat, “And build for Virtue a secure retreat; “Where each devoted pilgrim might repair, “And Christ receive the tributary prayer? “Where Triumph stands, defeated of its aim, “How vain the victory! how fruitless fame! “While still the wish'd atchievement turns aside, “And conquest flows, but with a different tide. “For wherefore is the might of Europe arm'd, “Asia invaded, and the world alarm'd, “If ruin be alone the victor's praise, “And states subverted, while we meant to raise? “Frail is the strength of sublunary things, “The pomp of titles, and the pride of kings; “Nor such the hope a faithful few may boast, “Hemm'd in by nations, and a barbarous coast; “Our country distant, fickle Greece untried, “Nor aught but Heaven to combat on our side. “True, we have fought, nor have we fought in vain— “Proud Antioch won, and hostile armies slain! “But these atchieved by many a wondrous way, “Shew GOD still guides the fortune of the day; “Then if we seek or conquest, or applause, “Through means averse to his victorious cause, “The pride of triumph, and the thirst of fame, “In death shall vanish, or be quench'd in shame. “Ah! never may our arms such issue find, “Nor we rebel ingrate, while Heaven is kind; “But still conform'd to the Divine Behest, “Be the great period, as commencement, blest! “Then, then, while time, while every pass is ours, “And prompt occasion chides our lingering powers, “Quick let us rise, toss high the spacious mound, “And circling gird Jerusalem around. “For me, ye princes! hear what I presage— “Be witness Heaven! and every future age! “Now is the conquering crisis mark'd by fate; “Now, is the time, to give the world a date, “The time to consecrate your deeds to fame, “To bless your arms, or ever blast your name: “But once elaps'd, though panting to regain, “Vain are our hopes, our labours wake in vain; “Each sun shall set, a witness to our woe, “And Egypt succour the recruited foe.” He ceas'd; a solemn whispering fill'd the pause, And the whole senate murmur'd deep applause: When Peter, sage and venerable man, Slow-rising, to the circling chiefs began. (Tho' distant from the war, and world retired, Prime author, he the distant war inspired; Which once in act, he issued from his cell, And thus promotes what he commenced so well.) “With transport I survey the Truth exprest “Warm in each eye, and big in every breast; “When Bulloign speaks it with prevailing charms, “No task remains but to enforce with arms: “Yet pardon one reflection still behind, “A weight long since incumbent o'er my mind. “Where friendships are by light suspicions coold, “And rulers are themselves by passions ruled, “Incongruous orders issued by the great, “Sedition pregnant in the lower state; “Occasions opportune are ever lost, “And every good and glorious end is crost: “Ill does it seem, when discord thus attaints “The cause of Christians, and a host of saints; “A host, whom breach eternal must divide, “While various minds in various powers preside. “The mutual weal divided power withstands, “Nor justice holds her scale with various hands; “Corruption every partial view attends, “And the torn state each selfish member rends. “Not so has nature, in the frame of man, “Drawn the true scheme of each politic plan; “Gave various parts to form one beauteous whole, “And gave a Head in prudence to controul; “Like ruler should ye chuse, could I advise, “And form your own, as nature's conduct, wise.” He said, when, mantling from each hero's breast, Ambition mounts in every eye exprest: But soon a beam, emissive from above, Shed mental day, and touch'd the heart with love; Gave jealous rage to know Divine Controul, And ruled the tempest rising in the soul. Calm reason the recoiling tumult sways; The sage's speech attentive judgment weighs; To merit every partial view expands, And Godfrey! Godfrey! every voice demands. His will, they vote, their future test of right, His leading arm their ensign to the fight, Their Atlas fit to bear the incumbent weight, The trust of empire, and the task of state; Submiss, to him they yield unrival'd sway, And willing princes, late his peers, obey. The consult ended, and the Royal Name Was born wide wafted on the wings of fame; The news a thousand busy tongues impart, Chear every brow, and gladden every heart. For not unconscious was the warlike crowd, Of worth to every vulgar eye avow'd; Approving throngs their Godfrey's presence greet, Charm'd to his sight, or prostrate at his feet, Proclaim their monarch with united voice, And loudly consecrate the publick choice. He mild returns, while corresponding grace Speaks from his mien, and answers in his face; Then bids his host prepare their bright array, And light with early arms the ensuing day. The ruddy sun, now orient, chased the dawn, Shot o'er the sea, and reach'd the dewy lawn; Up with the morn arose the ready train, Each seiz'd his arms, and issued on the plain. The driving squadrons fill the spacious coast; Wide wave the banners of the various host, Whose burnish'd mail, with flitting lustre gay, Reflect thick lightnings, and return the day. Superior the observant Godfrey stands, Orders the field, and marshals all the bands; Directs the moving legions from on high, And rules a host with his experienced eye. Say thou, my soul, with gifts divinely blest, And all thy treasures of a conscious breast! What chiefs conspicuous then adorn'd the plain, Their ancient glory, and attending train? So may'st thou recollect the spoils of age, And from oblivion snatch the future page: To thee old Time shall every trophy yield, And all the pristine honours of the field, Transplanted fair on each immortal line, And every ear, in every age, be thine. First came the Gauls, Clothario at their head, Whom Hugo late, unhappy warrior, led: Where four fair streams an ample nation fold, And Gallia's isle with soft embraces hold, He in the front of levied numbers shone, Prime of their host, and brother of the throne; But early death supprest the vital flame, Secure of Heaven, and still surviving fame. Nor now the troops an equal leader scorn, Great as the first, tho' not of princes born: A thousand arm'd, sedate they move along, In weighty mail indissolubly strong; Attend their chief with boasted ensigns gay, And the proud arms of ancient France display. To these, each clasp'd within his steely case, Alike in stature, and in martial grace, From Celtic Gaul a kindred band succeeds, A thousand warriors, on a thousand steeds; Normania's Robert in the van presides, And the closed files with native sceptre guides. Two Prelates next their dreaded arms unite, Renown'd for piety, as famed in fight; Great Ademare with standards richly spread, And William reverend at his people's head: Great William, chief amid four hundred known, From Orange and the deep meander'd Rhone; Like dangers Ademare from Poget sought, And in the front of equal numbers fought. Awful in arms, in ministry divine, Revered alike, in lawn or mail they shine; Their docile troops with bold example teach, And fearless combat for the Faith they preach. Then Baldwin o'er his powers appeared supreme, From Bouillon seated on the silver Seme, Chief of the bands, whom late Duke Godfrey led, Now Chief of chiefs, and of their host the head. Carinto o'er four hundred next presides, With valour fires them, and with wisdom guides; But thrice that number mightier Baldwin leads, And arm'd and haughty in the van precedes. To these ensue amid the beaten fields, Whom Guelpho governs, and whom Suabia yields; Guelpho, with merit, as with fortune crown'd, And greatly even among the great renown'd: The princely house of Est, and Roman sire, Their offspring's emulating acts inspire; But distant, he his native country sway'd, And where the chief was born the soil obey'd. Two neighbouring floods his bounded realms contain, The rising Danaw, and the circling Rhene, Maternal heritage, with plenty blest, By Rhetians erst, and northern Sweves possest! With nations added by his conquering sword, Carinthia too confest the Guelphian lord; A race addicted much to free delights, To social joys, and hospitable rites, While o'er their huts the wintry tempests pass, Warm'd by the genial fire and sparkling glass: Five thousand hence the sage commander drew, A chearful, faithful, and intrepid crew; Sad chance of war, the greater number slain, To mirth no longer wakeful, press the plain. The Belgi next, in helms and polish'd mail Their snowy limbs and flaxen ringlets veil; Whose narrow realms unbounded wealth contain, Hemm'd in by France, Almania, and the Main. Where the Moselle and blended Rhine extend, Wide o'er the banks their weighty harvests bend; A people valiant, and inured to toil, Domestic industry, and foreign spoil. With these appear, disposed in armed files, The subject powers of their associate isles; Who with steep mounds repair those dangerous shores, Where the breach threatens, and the tempest roars; Where the proud flood disdains inferior prey, And o'er a nation pours the headlong sea. Beneath another Robert all unite, A thousand arm'd, and eager for the fight, They pass, and to the British squadrons yield The next succession of the moving field. But these, superior to the Belgi shone, Array'd by William, Albion's younger son; From their broad backs their graceful weapons flow, The swift wing'd quiver, and the twanging bow: With them, Hibernia sends her sons to war, Hibernia, neighbour of the northern star, Where her bleak hills and hoary woods aspire, And less'ning from the distant world retire. Then Tancred caught the eye with heedless grace, Strength in his arm, and beauty in his face: Of all that valiant, that unnumber'd host, Rinaldo might superior prowess boast; Of worth untainted, fearless in the fight, And else unmatch'd, in glory, as in might. One sole default his nobler ardor chain'd, While love amid his strength of virtues reign'd, Caught from a glance of momentary charms, And nurs'd with anguish in the din of arms. So fame relates, on that triumphant day, When Persians fell an undistinguish'd prey, Far from his host the slaughter Tancred led, And singly follow'd where the foremost fled; Till feverish, and fatigued, he sought repose, And to his wish a rural arbour rose, Where a cool stream, beneath the whispering shade, With pendent flowers, and quivering willows play'd; Thither he turn'd, but, with unwary thought, Soon lost the sweets of that repose he sought. By the clear stream unlook'd for perils lay, In all the charms of virgin beauty gay; Her body arm'd with Amazonian grace, But obvious all the dangers of her face: His captive step the warrior stopp'd amazed, Sigh'd as he look'd, and trembled while he gazed; His eyes ran o'er the maid, with hasty art Thence drew her form, and fix'd it in his heart. But soon alarm'd the beauteous Pagan rose; With lovely threats her kindling visage glows; She braced her helm, and fierce the hero view'd, In act to combat whom her charms subdued. His troops approach'd; the virgin fled like wind, But hoped in vain to leave the chief behind: The place, the person, present to his view, The nymph still flies, and still his thoughts pursue; Within his eyes the loved ideas roll, Heave in his heart, and sicken in his soul. Hence o'er his cheek distemper'd anguish spread, Prey'd on his strength, and on his beauty fed; Despair lay sad, but silent in his breast, And sighs alone the lengthening woe exprest. Proud to attend, Campania's valiant bands, Eight hundred horse, await the chief's commands; Campania, blest with all the bloom of health, A seat of pleasures, and a fund of wealth, Where the rich odours breathe along her vales, And feed old ocean with the fragrant gales. Behind, two hundred hardy warriors came, The only warriors of the Grecian name: Light arm'd, and swift, they range the imbattel'd field, Nor poise the lance, nor bear the ponderous shield; But in close fight, or distant skirmish, know The dextrous fauchion, and the bending bow. Spare were their steeds, and slender their repast, But blithe and agile as an eastern blast; Untired, and practised to the nimble rein, They stop, and turn, and dart along the plain: Thus born, the riders confidently go, Deface the battle, and fatigue the foe; Expert to charge, to traverse, and to fly, Pursued they combat, and the conquerors die. Tatino points their progress o'er the fields, He the sole chief the Grecian empire yields; Inglorious Greece! in indolence profound Reposed, while arm'd contention ranged around: “But now the sad equivalent is paid; “Left by the cause you once refused to aid, “The haughty Pagan lords it o'er your plains, “And wakes the shameful lethargy with chains.” To close the rear the bold Adventurers came, The last in order, tho' the first in fame; A troop of heroes, Europe's proudest boast, And the dire terror of the Asian host! Whate'er through times of high memorial rung, By prose recorded, or by poets sung, Atchievements valorous, and knights renown'd, In chivalry, or antique fable found— Transferr'd to These, may real credence find, And sum the excellence of human kind. Tho' each might claim, as of peculiar right, To lead a host, and rule the ranks of fight, Dudon that high pre-eminence demands, By joint assent of the Adventurous bands. Where Aufidus first rolls an infant wave, This chief of chiefs Hesperian Conza gave: Sage were his words, and hoary was his head, To constant toil, and early battle bred; Yet ever was his boiling courage young, And his tried nerve to vivid action strung; His bosom nobly trench'd with many a scar, Old to the field, the father of the war. Amid the prime of those illustrious peers Eustatio, Bulloign's youngest son appears; Great was his challenge of peculiar fame, But more thro' his imperial brother's name. With him, Gernando, heir of Norway rides, And in his pomp of vaunted title prides: Nor less distinguish'd, in the peerless train, Rode the famed Roger, and bold Engerlane; Gentonio and Rambaldo, far renown'd; And the Twin Gerrards with like honours crown'd. Nor here Obizo, or Ubaldo there, With Rosmond Lancaster's redoubted heir, Consigned to latest annals shall accuse, The mute neglect of our injurious muse; Nor brave Achilles, Sforza, Palameed, Well worthy praise for many a worthy deed; From Lombardy the valiant brethren came, To form the great triumvirate of fame. With these rode Otton, who, in single fight, Won the dire trophy of the Paynim knight, High on whose helm a naked infant lay, Curl'd by a snake voracious o'er the prey. The like memorial Guaschar, Raphe, demand, Who boldly join the Voluntary Band; To Eberard and Guernier too belong, The force and fame of an immortal song; And the two Guidos equal honours claim, Alike in glory and alike in name. But you, bright pair! shall ever foremost shine; Shall still survive, to deck the mournful line— Gildippe, in thy dearer Edward blest; And Edward, only in thy cares distrest! Too fond the knot which wedded faith supplies, When mutual merit holds what beauty ties! One life inspired them, nor could death divide; They fought together, and together died. Ah Love, all subtle tutor, thou can'st teach What, uninstructive else, the world might preach; Give the soft sex to loathe inglorious rest, String the weak arm, and steel the snowy breast! You braced the Fair one's helm, her corselet tied, And gave the guardian to her Edward's side! Thus, on they past, inseparably pair'd; For him she battell'd, and for her he fear'd: By each, for each alone, was life desired; And, wounded in the other, each expired. Last in the rear of that imbattel'd train, Shone the young comet of the glittering plain, Rinaldo—in whose fair, majestic face, Soft beauty sweeten'd every martial grace: The youth impatient of his manly prime, Fled from his years, and stripp'd the speed of Time; Proud on his arm the force of battel lay, And round his snowy limbs the Graces play. This chief, by Adige on the winding shore, Sophia, spouse to great Bertoldo, bore: But soon Matilda takes their infant heir, Caresses fondly, and conducts with care; To early honour fires his growing youth, The thirst of glory, and the love of truth; When to his ears the warlike tidings came, And sent the stripling to the fields of fame. Five summers thrice had bloom'd around his head, When to the wond'ring camp the warrior fled: Alone he past, all eager on his way, And reach'd the shore, and cross'd the Egean sea; Then sped along by many an unknown coast, And mix'd exulting with the Christian host. And now three years were spent amid alarms, Since first the princely fugitive took arms, When manhood early dawning from within, Shed the smooth down to deck his ivory chin. The horsemen past, the numerous foot succeed, And trace the marches of the bounding steed; But these, Tolosa's monarch, Raimond heads, And in the front majestically treads: From the proud cliffs of Pyrenêan hills, From lucid Garonne, and the neighbouring rills, Wide o'er a placid climate stretch'd his reign, And eastward overlook'd the Midland-main. Four thousand veterans hence the hero drew, Who all the arts of various battle knew: Composed they march, to every toil addrest; But he, their bulwark, towers before the rest. Five thousand Stephen from Ambasia brings, And Tours, and shelving Blesæ, seat of kings, Where Loire the too delicious region laves, And cities float reflected o'er the waves; Impatient, hence, of discipline, or toil, They caught the native softness of the soil: Yet the fair troops, in martial semblance arm'd, With shew of lively preparation charm'd; Their valour as the lightly flaming fire, Furious they charge, and fainting soon retire. Alcasto then stepp'd forth with haughty pace; Fierce was his mien, and menacing his face: Where o'er the clouds the steepy Alps extend, Six thousand from Helvetia's towers attend; In shining mail their temper'd plowshares glance, Spread in the shield, and pointed in the lance; While the right arm, that ruled the flocks so late, Now threats the mighty, and insults the great. Last, in the Papal Standard, they display The Triple Crown, and Apostolic Key; Seven thousand valiant Romans march behind, And great Camillo had the charge assigned. The moving cuishes, and their corselets bright, Exchange quick lightnings, and fatigue the sight: Elate in hope, and chear'd amid alarms, They bless the cause that calls the world to arms; So to revive, and vindicate the fame, That once, unrival'd, mark'd the Roman name. Now, summ'd to view, the invincible array Stands on the plain, and brightens in the day: The General calls—obsequious to the sound, His peers approach, and range attentive round: When Bulloign his imperial will exprest, And thus reveal'd the counsels of his breast. “Soon as the next succeeding morn shall rise, “And dawning purple streak the eastern skies, “Prepared, and arm'd with best appointed speed, “Be every warrior, and be every steed; “For then we mean to visit Salem's towers, “By secret march, and swift invading powers: “The mighty crisis to the combat calls, “And the foe trembles in her sacred walls. Bold was the hope his ardent words inspire; As the plied fan provokes the slumbering fire, Impatient they regret the lingering night, Fierce for the day, and for the promis'd fight. But other cares hold Godfrey from repose, Nor tastes the Chief those transports he bestows: Yet deep he held the secret of his breast, From every ear and every eye supprest. Small cause of joy his late advices bring— How Lybia, arm'd beneath the Memphian king, From Damiata, eastward in the way To Gaza, on the Syrian frontiers lay. Innumerous there such warriors he unites, As force made confident, or fame excites; Nor Godfrey hopes advances can be slow, From so inveterate, so renown'd a foe: How best to frustrate, or oppose, he seeks; And to his legate, trusty Henry, speaks. “Go, speed thee, Henry—spread the flying sail, “Cut the green wave, and catch the favouring gale; “Nor give indulgence to the labouring oar, “Till the crook'd keel divides the Grecian shore. “There, should arrive, as private seals impart, “From one who knows not the deceiving art, “The Royal Dane, for matchless force renown'd, “As with the grace of every virtue crown'd; “Zeal sends the Northern Youth its warmest ray, “And glory wings him to the toilsome way, “From the cold circle, and the polar star, “The friend and brave companion of the war. “But, for I know the Greekish monarch's heart, “Stored with old wiles, and well dissembled art, “I fear lest he divert the princely youth, “And wrest his purpose from the paths of Truth; “Or other specious enterprize persuade, “And rob our armies of the promis'd aid. “But you, my messenger, and faithful friend, “Dispose his journey to its destined end; “Alike his honour, and our arms, shall need “His utmost forces, and his swiftest speed. “Nor you return, but to the Grecian sue “For aids, by previous obligation due, “Such aids as with his kingly compact stands; “And more than compact,—what the Cause demands.” The guardian Chief thus wakeful shuns repose, While in his care ten thousand eye-lids close: The herald, speeding to the breezy shore, The seals of trust and royal greeting bore; And late, the Duke, from every task reclined, Gave to his couch the labours of his mind. And now the night, imbalm'd in early dew, Slow ebbing, from the paler dawn withdrew; Aurora on the purpling ocean rose; The reddening east with warmer lustre glows; His previous beam the solar brightness shed, And from the wave uprais'd his peerless head— While thro' the camp loud echoing clarions ring; Rous'd to the note, the sprightly soldiers spring; Their ears delighted drink the warlike sounds, And every heart with answering motion bounds. So joys the peasant on the sultry plain, When thunders roll, the messengers of rain. With quick impatience every bosom glows; Apt to their limbs, the wonted armours close: Each conscious soldier on his chief attends, And o'er the plain the ranging host extends: The banners stream, redundant to the wind; All move, as ruled by one informing mind; While high towards heaven, the Cross, in triumph spread, Waves from the van, and blazes at their head. Now up the steep of heaven the cloudless sun, Fresh in his pomp of rising splendor shone— He strikes the squadrons with a trembling light; The flash gleams restless, and rejects the sight: All æther flames, and sparkles round the host, And the wide glory fires the distant coast; The coursers neigh, the clanging arms resound, And deafening hills return the din around. Mean while the Chief, great guardian of his train, Renders all slights of lurking ambush vain: He sends the light arm'd horse detach'd before, To scour the woodland and the winding shore; The pioneers with previous labours go, Pull down the lofty, and supply the low, Unfold the strait, detect the covert way, And give large travel to the wide array. Not the rude onsets of encountering foes, Soon scatter'd, could the impervious march oppose; Not the proud rampart, and the steepy mound, The guarded battlement, and trench profound— In vain by thickets, rocks, and hills, withstood, The rising forest, and the rushing flood! So when the Po, imperial torrent, swells, No power resists him, and no force repels: Deep from the root the sylvan shade he heaves, The ruin rolls ingulph'd within his waves; He foams, he roars, he bounds along the plain, And bears his prey triumphant to the Main. Mean time, the king of Tripoli, alarm'd, Mann'd every hold, and every man he arm'd; But still restrain'd his powers, his wealth supprest, And ruled the wrath rebellious in his breast; With specious gifts, and ill dissembled cheer, Beneath feign'd friendship he disguised his fear; Signed every term that Godfrey would impose, And gave wide progress to his potent foes. Where, south from Salem, Seir's hills arise, And eastward range, incumbent o'er the skies, Promiscuous pours a numerous troop of friends, And joyful, every sex and age descends: Large gifts, the tribute of their love, they bring To the great Chief, of Christian armies king; They view the wondrous man with strange delight, Press to his touch, and dwell upon his sight; Thro' ways well known conduct his journey'd host, And point his passage o'er the hostile coast. Still toward the deep, the windings they explore, On sea-beat shallows, and the sanded shore; Off to the right the ships of burden ride, And plow the surge that murmurs at their side. Convenient here, the flying barge from far, Imports the various implements of war; Replete from Scios, and the Greekish isles, All autumn in the copious navy smiles; While luscious Crete her generous juice bestows, And to the host the purple vintage flows. From Britain, Belgia, and the Gallic bays, From Venice, native of the circling seas; The gulph of Genoa, and Tuscan shores, And where Sicilia piles her naval stores; Ships, barks, and gallies, cut the Midland-main, And join in arms, a complicated train. For here no Pagan to the driving gale, With daring hand unfurls his timorous sail; Unrival'd round, the huge Armada rides, And with a forest veils the nether tides; Beneath the load, indignant, Ocean swells, The vessel labours, and the surge rebels. Wing'd from the circling world the fleet unites; One wish informs them, and one cause invites: Their murmuring keels divide the side-long coast, With large provision to the landed host; Then launch'd, they shout, and scour the winding shore, Hoist every sail, and ply with every oar; All bound, where Christ the dear ablution shed, And, for a sinful world, a sinless victim bled. Fame flies thro' Sion with preceding sound, And hastes to spread the fearful news around; The powers, the names, the numbers, all she sums— “See, see,” she cries, “the dreaded victor comes! “His steps a troop of matchless heroes wait, “Known to the field, the delegates of fate: “Fear ye, whose short enduring power detains “The sacred city, and her saints in chains! “He comes; and on his conquering weapon brings, “Death to her foes, and terror to her kings!” Those ills, that present we might learn to bear, In prospect spread, and magnify by fear; The phantom realized in fancy's eye, Is greater ill than all those ills we fly. With busy face, and ever listening ear, Restless they run to learn, but dread to hear; Throughout the city, and adjacent plains, Tumultuous haste, distrust, and rumour reigns; While in her old malicious Tyrant's soul, Black thoughts and hoary machinations roll. For Aladine in Sion newly throned, Beneath the proud usurper Judah groan'd: Dire was the native purpose of his mind, To every act of early ill inclined; But as his years increase, his fires asswage, Allay with time, and mitigate with age. He learns the progress of the Christian powers, That like a torrent comes to sap his towers; And a new doubt his anxious bosom tears— Treason within, and force without, he fears. For Salem's sacred city, then inclosed, Two different sects, of different faith, composed; In Christ, divine instructor, those believ'd; And these, in Macon, carnally deceiv'd: In number, and in power, the last excel; The former, only, in believing well. But late, when he the imperial seat attain'd, And scepter'd o'er the powers of Judah reign'd, The Paynims lighten'd from the tax of state, He whelms the Christians with the unequal weight. Suspicious hence, he trembles in his turn, Lest injury with due resentment burn. Rous'd at the thought, his native wrath respires, And wakes the fury of his slumbering fires; The glut of future carnage feasts his soul, And in his eye new scenes of slaughter roll. Thus numb, and peaceful, lies some poisonous snake, Chill'd in the dropping of a wintry brake; Till, warm'd beneath the sun's returning ray, He stirs, and curls, and kindles with the day; Revived to ill, his burnish'd spires arise, And venom lightens from his sanguine eyes. “Behold,” he said, “malicious in their joy, “How the smile lurks, when Christians would destroy! “In transport hush'd, they wait the coming foe, “Their hearts exulting in the publick woe: “Nor less such secret meditations mean, “Than nightly treasons, and some murderous scene; “Or thro' our gates yon hostile powers to guide, “To us tho' hostile, yet to them allied. “But prudence bids to disappoint the blow, “And turn its force, retorted on the foe; “The traitor's scheme shall on himself recoil, “And take him, with his own invented toil. “Stabb'd on the breast, let bleeding infants die; “Each sex, and age, in mingling slaughter lie; “While hoary on the shrine their priests expire, “And every temple flames a funeral pyre! So brew'd the murderous mischief in his mind, Dubious to act, what deadly he designed; The threatful storm, superior fears controul, And do the work of mercy in his soul; While the fell purpose thro' his bosom boils, With rancour rises, and with dread recoils, Lest to himself like fortune might betide, Compell'd to crave that mercy he denied, And all the war, with desperate vengeance sped, Should pour its wrath on his devoted head. The Tyrant hence, irresolute in rage, Diverts the fury which he can't asswage; Lays the wide suburbs level with the ground, And further spreads consuming fires around; Fell poison with the living fount he blends, Where death amid the rolling streams descends; Acts all a cruel prudence can suggest, And feeds the fiend that ravens in his breast. Defensive next, the city claims his cares; The mound he deepens, and the breach repairs: Three sides, impregnable, disdain'd the fray; Sole, on the north, the doubt of battle lay: But here, with utmost vigilance he plies; The bars are doubled, and the ramparts rise; And last, with native, and auxiliar powers, He arms her wards, and fortifies her towers. BOOK II. The King, in each anticipating thought, Thus foil'd his foes, and future combats fought; When lo! Ismeno, horrid Seer, drew nigh, A vicious counsellor, and dread ally; Ismeno, deep in all the powers of hell, The mystic philter, and infernal spell!— The monumental corse Ismeno warm'd, And the pale dead with mimic life inform'd; Compell'd the fiends to issue to his aid, And hell's dread king in his own realms obey'd. A Christian once, he late transferr'd his vows, And now to Macon, fitter master, bows; Nor well the form of either system knew, False to the first, nor to the latter true: Still were the terms of sacred phrase retain'd, Mix'd in his songs, and in his rites profaned; With lore divine the abhorrent charm he yokes, And Highest Heaven with deepest hell invokes. Dire from his cave, where, impiously retired, His arts he practised and his skill acquired, He issued, grateful to a Tyrant's will; And thus advised the minister of ill. “You see, O King, the fury of our foes, “Flush'd with the past, for future conquest glows; “But fury is by answering force controll'd, “And heaven is prompt in favour to the bold. “Thrice happy Judah, doubly arm'd in thee! “Expert to act, as cautious to foresee, “Who singly boast the twofold power to save, “Mature for counsel, as for combat brave. “Ah would your subjects catch the kindred fire, “And bravely emulate as you inspire, “Then Godfrey, soon entomb'd, might here obtain “Unenvied tenure, and a still domain. “For me, whate'er sage science may devise, “Whate'er of trust in deepest magic lies, “I bring, prepared, through each adventurous state, “To ward your danger, or to share your fate; “Bow'd to the lore of hecromantic laws, “The host exiled from heaven shall aid your cause: “Then list to what my first instructions move; “And what I counsel, let my king approve. “Remote, and deep withdrawn from vulgar eyes, “A shrine beneath the Christian temple lies, “With shew of pompous consecration placed, “And the bright Image of their Goddess graced: “A mortal deity this Virgin bore, “And her those sects idolatrous adore; “His vows to her the travell'd pilgrim pays, “The lights perpetual round her idol blaze; “While veil'd, and passive, she attends the throng, “Their various offering, and their saintly song. “But thence, by your imperial hand convey'd, “Transport the form of this Maternal Maid, “And laid within our Prophet's sacred fane, “Let ritual song and circling charms retain: “For such the force of our mysterious art, “And such the powers my wondrous spells impart, “That while this new Palladium we possess, “Your arms shall ever meet the wish'd success, “These walls impregnable ensure your reign, “And hostile fury storm around in vain.” He spoke; and prompt to ill the Tyrant rose: Impatience through his kindling aspect glows; Unhallow'd, to the latent shrine he flies, And grasps, with arms impure, the Virgin Prize: In vain the zealous ministry withstands, Opprobrious, he insults their reverend bands; Then bears his sacrilege to Macon's fane, Where Heaven was ever deaf, and prayer prophane: The Sorcerer with dread action stalks around, And shocks with blasphemy the trembling ground. And now succeeding morn, array'd in white, Had silver'd Solyma with new-born light; His charge in vain the anxious keeper sought, As quickly vanish'd as prophanely brought: All pale, the tidings to his prince he bears, Who scarce the messenger in madness spares, But o'er the Christians all his rage renews, For malice ne'er wants colour to accuse. Yet, whether mortal arm may boast the deed, Or Heaven's high hand the captive Image freed, Remote the Goddess from pollution bore, And left the Tyrant blindly to explore— The times declare not; but in silence chuse To leave the deep decision to the muse, Who would all praise in piety assign As due to power superior and divine. Strict was the search the chasing monarch made, And wide his ministers of wrath invade; His threats, and vows, or menace, or invite, Whom rack could terrify, or gold requite: The wizard too his impious art applies, And to his aid emerging demons rise: Nor art, nor yet demoniac aid avails, Nor deepest hell imparts what Heaven conceals. But when, no more with baffled charms amused, The King in wrath conceived his power abused, His limbs all trembled, and his eyes shot flame, And vengeful fury shook his labouring frame: Rouz'd in the wrath of unforgiving age, Against the faithful burn'd his endless rage; “Perish!” he cried, “Destruction seize on all! “So, with the race, the curs'd offender fall. “Yes, e're the guilty 'scape the wrath decreed, “Perish the just, and let the guiltless bleed! “What said I, guiltless?—O ill-suited name! “Alike all Christians all our vengeance claim; “Foes to our Prophet, traitors to our state, “They justly suffer by the laws they hate. “Up, up, my subjects, with the sword and fire; “Quick be their doom, and let their name expire!” So spoke the Tyrant; Fame received the sound, And cloath'd in terror, pours the news around: The blood from every Christian cheek she drains, Strikes to their hearts, and shudders in their veins: No force of prayer, no bold defence they try, Fear froze their limbs, nor left the power to fly; While o'er their souls impending horrors wait, And half anticipate the stroke of fate: But succour, least foreseen, deceived the grave; For Heaven is prompt, as potent still to save. Then dwelt in Solyma a blooming Maid, With inward Truth, as outward charms array'd Heroic sentiment her bosom warm'd, And her bright limbs the Infant Graces form'd; Yet with unconscious, or regardless eyes, She saw no charm, or seen, refused to prize; Within herself her treasured sweetness closed, And private in domestic peace reposed. But merit vainly from esteem retires; The world pursues, discloses, and admires: In vain from Love the bashful Charmer flies, A bashful Youth perceives, pursues, and dies; To him, intruding Love the maid reveal'd, And kill'd with graces from herself conceal'd. Love through the shade of deepest covert spies, A blindfold Argus with a thousand eyes; A various influence his powers impart, And warm the chaste, and cool the wanton heart. Sophronia she, whose charms his love inspired; Olindo he, whose love those charms admired; In every grace, to every virtue train'd, One faith instructed, and one town contain'd. Yet he, nor hopes, nor ventures to complain, Hush'd as the eternal calm beneath the main; With awful glance at distance eyes the Fair, Breathes but to sigh, and loves but to despair; A prey to silent anguish, mourns alone, Unseen, unmark'd, unpitied, and unknown. The dire decree arrests Sophronia's ear, Nor taught the Christian for herself to fear; To nobler views her ample soul makes room, With her own death to ward the publick doom; The generous Maid would greatly bleed for all, And one a sacrifice for thousands fall. Strong zeal inspired, and native courage taught, But female decency reproves the thought; Nor so prevail'd, for resolutely shamed, The bolder blush through bashfulness enflamed. On through the gazing croud she past alone, And like a star new risen the Virgin shone; A veil thrown o'er her charms with thin disguise, But half eclips'd the danger of her eyes; Adorn'd, with easy negligence she moves, And every eye engages, and reproves; For mildness brightening through majestic grace, Spoke in her mein, and lighten'd in her face. Thus gazed by all, on past the lovely dame, And fearless to the royal presence came; Dire was the form the Tyrant's visage wore, Which she in innocence, regardless, bore. “O turn,” she cried, “the terrors of thy ire, “Nor thou, O King, against thyself conspire; “Taint not the guardian glories of thy reign, “With bleeding innocents, and subjects slain: “'Tis mine to give the traitor to thy view, “To point thy wrath, and point the vengeance due.” That decent confidence, and awful grace, Mix'd with the glories of that loveliest face, Surprized the Monarch; half abash'd he stands, And feels, that beauty, more than kings, commands: Low sunk before the Fair all forms of pride, And bend for mercy to the suppliant side, For mutual grace unbind the sovereign brow, Wishful to find, and willing to allow; But the fond hope no answering smiles impart, And wayward beauty damps the kindling heart. Not love, but sullen pleasure seiz'd his sense, A short amazement, and a still suspense: “At your request,” the Monarch mild replies, “Fate is no more, and scarce the guilty dies.” Then she—“Behold the criminal attends! “This hand perform'd, what still my heart commends; “From strange pollution bore our Sacred Dame, “And I alone your dreaded vengeance claim.” Thus, arm'd for pain, unterrified by death, Thus the sweet Innocence resigns her breath; Her life a ransom for her country yields, And a whole state with wide protection shields. Surprized he paused, yet seeming to require A form less fair, and apter to his ire: “Say, who conspired, who prompted to the deed? “Nor give a breast so soft as thine to bleed.” “All rivals,” she return'd, “my works disclaim, “Nor brook a partner in the deeds of fame: “My courage prompted what my thoughts conspired; “Alone I counsell'd, and alone acquired.” “On thee alone,” the Tyrant then replied, “Be the full weight of my resentment tried!” “'Tis just, 'tis just,” she cried, “nor I repine; “Mine be the penalty, the glory mine!” New choler now his gathering visage swells, And all the tyrant in his heart rebels: “How, where, hast thou presumed thy theft to hide? “Say, quick, nor further urge thy fate!” he cried. “Not rescued,” bold she said, “to be betray'd, “Is the blest shape of that Celestial Maid. “Vain you require what, now consumed with flame, “Nor infidels can touch, nor kings reclaim. “What would you more? your former captive freed, “You hold the criminal who boasts the deed. “But why the criminal to me transferr'd? “Must subjects bleed, when kings alone have err'd? “What you unjustly seiz'd, I justly gain'd; “And guiltless, purified what you profaned.” She spoke; and, from within, the labouring storm Rose in his voice, and spread o'er all his form: The dire distemper of the Tyrant's soul, No mercy mitigates, no bounds controul; In vain officious Love his Favourite arms, And lends an unavailing shield of charms. By doom severe, he judg'd the fearless dame With beauty's gifts to feed devouring flame: Officious villains on his wrath attend; Her veil and floating robe they rudely rend; Strict round her arms the livid cordage wind, And to the stake the lamb-like victim bind; While meek, and silent, she attends her fate, In pain unalter'd, and in death sedate, Save that the rose its wonted mansion fled, And like the lilly droop'd her beauteous head. The busy rumour spread with murmuring sound; The vulgar ran, and clustering pour'd around. Olindo too in trembling haste drew near, With love prophetic, and all pale with fear. But when, by soul distracting woe opprest, The dreaded truth his hapless eyes confest, His love condemn'd, in cruel fetters bound, And the dire ministers of death around; The Youth all frantic through the tumult broke, And thus the King in rage and haste bespoke: “Not so, not so, my lord, this vaunting dame “Shall arrogate, what only I can claim: “She did not, would not, could not singly dare “A work so weighty, and a deed so rare; “The guard with unexperienc'd craft deceive, “And from her seat the massy substance heave: “This arm atchieved what she assumes in vain.” (Ah thus he loved, though hopeless to obtain!) He added,—“Favour'd by the friendly night, “Where your proud fane admits the eastern light, “I scaled the steep, and gain'd the dangerous pass, “And through the postern bore the sacred mass: “Nor shall she thus usurp a foreign spoil, “With hazard enterprized, and earn'd with toil; “Mine are these welcome tortures, chains, and flame, “The trophied monument, and deathless name.” Her eyes from earth the grateful Charmer rais'd, And gently chiding, on her Lover gazed: “Say whence the frenzy that infects thy mind, “And why, ah why, to me severely kind? “Sufficient to my fate, howe'er I seem, “Thy life would but more cruelly redeem: “I want not such society in pain; “Whate'er he dares inflict, I dare sustain.” The Maid, in vain, the enamour'd Youth addrest, Nor shook the steady purpose of his breast: His fate, in vain, the stedfast Youth demands; The Maid, as stedfast, and as kind, withstands. O wondrous pair!—Unpleasing, pleasing sight! Where love, and virtue, amicably fight; Where death alone is to the victor dear, And safety's all the vanquish'd wretch can fear. But now his wrath the King no longer rein'd, Who vengeful judged his regal power disdain'd: “Cease, cease!” with cruel irony he cries; “You both have won, and shall obtain the prize.” Quick, at his beck, the guards, who waited round, With chains, the brave, the blooming stripling bound; Then back to back the Lovely Pair they tied, And whom they join in death, in death divide. And now, applied to the surrounding pyre, Contagious breath provokes the lingering fire. A mournful pause the plaintive lover broke, And to his loved, his patient partner, spoke: “Are then my vows, my tedious sufferings crown'd, “With thee in such eternal spousals bound? “Far other ties my flattering fancy framed, “Far other fire my faithful breast inflamed! “Nor these the ties that bind connubial hearts; “Nor these the fires the bridal lamp imparts! “Sad is the scene our nuptial pomp displays, “And long I earn'd what fate severely pays, “While life still sunder'd whom the grave unites, “And death my fond unfailing faith requites. “But yet, with thee, even agony finds ease; “Death knows to charm, and pain can learn to please: “Thy fate alone can teach me to repine, “And all the pangs you feel are doubly mine. “Ah! could I but obtain, that, breast to breast, “Of thee in this my latest hour possest, “I might but catch thee with my closing eye, “And my last breath within thy bosom sigh— “That were a bliss, beyond what life could give; “It were indeed too much to feel, and live!” Thus he, with various agitation moved; And thus the Maid with gentle speech reproved. “Not these the griefs, the cares, you should attend; “Far other griefs, far other cares, impend— “The dreadful summons of offended Power, “The doubtful sentence, and the mortal hour! “The lapse of frailty, and the kindling flame, “Alike thy penitence and transport claim; “The martyr, with peculiar splendours bright, “Selected sits above the sons of light! “View yon fair azure with desiring eye, “Nor fear to tread the glories of the sky: “But O—beyond, beyond,—what scenes invite! “O'er Heaven, another Heaven, still opening to our sight!” Soft sorrows seiz'd the pale deploring crowd: The Pagans wept their pitying griefs aloud; But not the Christians the still tempest show, They drink their tears, and choak the swelling woe. The King, who felt unwonted pity rise, Melt in his soul, and moisten in his eyes, Retired, the soft emotion to controul, And fix the flinty temper of his soul. But you, bright Maid, transcendent greatness proved, By weeping floods and circling flames unmoved; Inspired an anguish you refused to own, In grief superior, and in crowds alone! Thus hope was far from every weeping eye, And death amid involving fires drew nigh; When, mounted like some favourite son of fame, A Stranger to the mourning concourse came: In foreign semblance, and unwonted mode, Proud thro' the parting throng the hero rode; Clorinda's corselet graced the warrior's breast, And the famed tygress raven'd on her crest; The admiring crouds her awful signal own, To routed hosts and trembling nations known. With nobler gifts of native worth adorn'd, The heroic Maid her sex's softness scorn'd; Scorn'd each important toil of female hearts, The tricking ornament, and needled arts, The silken indolence, the soft fatigue, The chamber'd spleen, and closeted intrigue: Nor envious breath her virgin honour stain'd, Through wander'd climes and foughten fields retain'd; While o'er the beauties of her loveliest face, Delight sat fierce, and smiled with dreaded grace. With early thirst of each adventurous deed, She steer'd the manage of the bounding steed; With infant arm would launch the whistling spear, Whirl the rough disk, and wield the sword in air; And foil'd each rival with contending grace, Strain'd in the grasp, or distanced in the race. Now from the hills the shaggy spoils she tore, The brinded lion, and the tusky boar; And last whole hosts beneath her prowess yield, She riots like a tygress o'er the field. From Persia late the fair destroyer came, And bore deep hatred to the Christian name; Oft had she bathed the mountains with their blood, And with their bodies choak'd the purpling flood: At Salem just arrived, her wandering view, Aspiring flames and murmuring tumults drew. When curious to enquire she turn'd with speed, And o'er the pavement urg'd her flying steed. The crowd gave way; the Amazonian Fair With strict regard beheld the captive pair— The Virgin silent, while the Youth repined; The stronger plaintive, and the weak resigned; But plaintive he, as in her sufferings pain'd, No pangs but for the dearer Maid sustain'd; She silent, as her speech were in her eyes, To hold superior converse with the skies, As though her soul had took a previous flight, The mortal sufferings passed, and Heaven in sight. Clorinda's breast divine compassion fill'd, Her silver lids the pitying drops distill'd; But chief she mourn'd, and chief admired the Maid, Placid in pain, nor even in death dismay'd; Then fervent thus a neighbouring Sage addrest: “Ah! whence this lovely pair, and why distrest? “Such death, where such apparent virtues shine, “What crime can merit, or what heart design?” She spoke; the man of courtesy explain'd Whate'er of note the mournful tale contain'd: Her soul, with kindred dignity inspired, Their guilt acquitted, and their worth admired; And soon her enterprising thoughts presume By suit, or battle, to reverse their doom: Quick from the stake the approaching sire she drew, And thus spoke terror to the listening crew: “Let none, with cruel or adventurous hand, “Officious dare to act what I withstand, “Till from the court returning orders bring “Freedom, or fate, determin'd by your King: “Nor fear in this to rouse the monarch's rage; “My will's your warrant, and my word your gage.” So saying, to their souls she look'd dismay, As only born for others to obey; Then swift to court the lovely suitor ran, But obvious met the King, and brief began. “E're this, O King, Clorinda's distant fame “Has haply taught your ear a stranger's name, “Who comes, you'll say presumptuous, thus alone, “To guard our faith, and vindicate your throne. “Whate'er of war the various terms comprize, “Within my sphere of copious battle lies; “Nor aught above me, nor beneath I know, “From the proud bulwark to repel the foe, “To form the phalanx, or to lead the field, “Or hand to hand the deadly weapon wield.” She ceas'd; and thus the King—“O glorious Maid! “Arm of the host you condescend to aid, “From pole to pole thy honour'd name is known, “Thy fame unbounded by the distant Lone: “Not all this warlike confidence of towers, “The force of native and auxiliar powers, “Such trust defensive of our throne provide, “As that right hand, that weapon at thy side. “Come Godfrey, come, with laurels on thy brow, “Thy march too swift, so late, is tedious now; “Nor less than his Clorinda's glories claim, “Thy word as absolute, as great thy fame! “Thine be the sphere of arbitrary sway, “The secret council, and the bold array; “Beneath thy scepter'd hand my powers I yield, “First in the throne, as foremost in the field! He spoke; with easy grace the Virgin bow'd, And suppliant thus her generous plea avow'd: “Though Aladine may deem the matter new, “Where gifts precede, and services ensue, “So highly your munificencee I hold, “Your bounty bids the diffident be bold. “Then for the aid I bring, the life would spend, “For all I shall perform, or may intend, “To my request those wretched captives give, “And grant the lovely criminals may live. “Their sentence merely on suspicion built, “Much might be urg'd abating of their guilt; “But every plea of innocence I wave, “And sole, in lieu of future service, crave. “Yet, mighty King, permit me to disclaim “The guilt imputed to the Christian name; “Nor should I from receiv'd opinion lead, “Were reason not resistless to persuade; “For ill the wizard's pedant arts retain “That sanctitude which Macon's laws ordain, “Whose tenets, all replete with lore divine, “Prohibit idols from his hallow'd shrine. “To him miraculous ascribe the deed, “His fane from guilt from profanation freed; “Nor thou repine, when guardian powers reject “What rites might innovate, or arts infect. “Let Ismen exercise, remote from arms, “His maze of tricks, and unavailing charms; “But the keen use of more decisive powers, “The magic of the circling blade be ours!” She said; and tho' the Monarch's stubborn breast Was proof to aught soft pity could suggest, Yet high observance of the gallant Maid, Her honour'd presence, and her promised aid, Prevail'd: “All pleading,” he return'd, “is vain; “Clorinda ne'er can ask, but to obtain: “Nor I their innocence or guilt debate; “Be you alike sole mistress of their fate!” Thus were they freed. Olindo, happiest youth! Great is the recompence that waits thy truth; Pure was thy constant flame, severe the test, And Heaven with equal retribution blest. Now beyond hope exulting, from despair He past associate with the yielding Fair: To death he loved her; and the grateful Maid, With a long life of mutual love repaid. But, ever to a tyrant's soul ingrate, He held such virtue dangerous in the state; And distant far the bridal exiles sent, Rich in their love, and each in each content. With these he banishes the brave, and young, And every Christian arm with vigour strung; In hostage then the softer sex retains, The tender infant binds in needless chains, Whose helpless cries the wonted names require, The endearing husband, and protecting sire. Some through the devious wild, or mountain shade, Where chance, or sadness tempted, pensive stray'd; While some, with glory and resentment fired, To heights of more determin'd worth aspired, Bold to Emmaus bend their warlike course, And with new arms augment the Christian force; For to Emmaus now approach'd their powers, Emmaus, west from Salem's regal towers. Who treads the fresh of April's early dew, (A thousand scenes of rural scope in view) At leisure may the mediate space beguile, By the third hour, the third of Hebrew style. While distant yet, the town and neighbouring coast, With the first ken, salute the Christian host, “Emmaus!” loud, triumphing legions cry, And catch the place with long desiring eye. And now, down heaven, the swift careering sun His evening course of steep direction run; At Godfrey's word the travell'd armies stand, And canvas cities rise to his command, Whose tented canopy, and flaxen shed, O'er many a field with ready structure spread. Nor yet heaven's lamp forsook the etherial plain, But hover'd verging on the western main, When lo! two peers, attractive of the eye, In mode of foreign ornament drew nigh: Peace in their hands and open brow they bear, Complacence in their gentle mien and air; While gorgeous equipage attendant wait Their embassy from Egypt's scepter'd state. The first Aletes, vers'd in every vice; Base was his birth, conspicuous was his rise: O'er Nile his proud vicegerence widely spread, And stored with wiles was his sagacious head; Soft on his lips persuasive fiction hung, Guile fill'd his heart, and eloquence his tongue; His manners easy, though his genius shrewd, Fair to engage, and subtle to delude; Smooth to persuade with false illusive phrase, To vindicate with blame, or kill with praise. With him Argantes, huge Circassian, came, A stranger late, but quickly known to fame; Through Egypt, prime in arms, the warrior shone, And now a Satrap graced the Memphian throne. Furious the bent of his unconquer'd soul, Nor knew his heart or pity or controul; Slave to his will, his will by passion sway'd, Proud, restless, fierce, untired, and undismay'd, Nor earth he thought his match in arms could yield, As yet unrival'd through the sanguine field! His impious arm the only God adored, His reason perch'd upon his conquering sword. Admittance to the General's ear they sue, And introduced the royal Godfrey view. Low on a couch, in unaffected state, Amid surrounding chiefs the Hero sate: Plain was his vestment, negligence with grace, And awe with meekness lived within his face; As Godfrey only could his state adorn, Too great to value, though too meek to scorn, Argantes entering, scarce his head inclin'd; Haughty his mien, expressive of his mind: As from due rite he purposely abstain'd, For conscious merits in himself retain'd. Not so Aletes; struck with decent awe, Entering he seem'd half wishing to withdraw; As one surprised, his forward step represt, And bore his hand respectful to his breast; Then easy, bow'd with deference profound, And fix'd his eyes half closing on the ground. Spontaneous through his lips, a wonted road, The stream of voluntary diction flow'd, Gentle as dews or summer's evening rain To slake the fevers of the sultry plain; While thus the Syriac melted from his tongue, And listening princes on the cadence hung. “O, mightiest thou! sole worthy of the sway, “Where circling heroes, chiefs like these, obey, “Who bear fresh wreaths on each victorious head, “Fired by thy deeds, and by thy conduct led. “Beyond the Herculean pillar flies thy fame, “And Egypt even to Nubia tells thy name. “But chief our monarch marks thy wondrous ways, “Lists to thy name, and dwells upon thy praise: “No envy his superior bosom fires, “He hears with pleasure, with esteem admires; “To worth like thine perceives his heart allied, “And is by love, if not religion tied. “Yet well apprized of what your arms intend, “Opposed where he in honour must defend, “From Us his amicable purpose know, “A faithful friend, but a reluctant foe. “With thee in arms, in council, and in mind, “In equal amity, and hate combin'd, “He vows, whate'er encountering dangers wait, “To fix the fortunes of thy wavering state; “Be Sion only sacred to repose, “He joins with Godfrey, should the world oppose. “Transcendent Chief! whose memorable page, “Shall send a tale to every future age, “Short is the span that gives thy deeds a date, “But long the time that wondring shall relate! “Thy rapid progress knows nor rest, nor bound— “What cities forced, or levell'd with the ground! “What battles fought! what victories obtain'd! “What provinces subdued! what empires gain'd! “Amazement flies, or trembles, at thy name; “Nor is there left a further work for fame: “New added power can add no new applause; “And glory, spread to either pole, must pause. “Soar'd to the zenith of a cloudless day, “Thy fortune culminates her warmest ray; “Her next advance the western steep invites, “Prone she descends, and suddenly benights. “Ah think, great Chief!—the dangerous venture shun, “Where all thy deeds may be at once undone: “Doubtful thy hope, and thy advantage small; “But great the loss, and wondrous deep the fall. “Yet, Godfrey may reject our fond address; “He views the future in the past success: “His sword with blood of routed armies stain'd, “Beneath his hand reluctant nations rein'd, “With all the bold the boundless wish can crave, “That bribes the fortunate, or fires the brave— “These, these may win him to the waste of war, “And passions prompt what reason would abhor. “Delusive orators! they still persuade, “Unsheath'd to brandish that redoubted blade; “Still to pursue where fortune would betray, “Where glory smooths the faithless arduous way, “Till Macon be no more; and waste, forlorn, “Sad Asia like some widow'd matron mourn: “Fair hopes, high projects, and allurements sweet, “But covert ruin, and assured deceit. “If zeal exhibits no intemperate dream, “Nor clouds of wrath eclipse thy reasoning beam; “How just, how different would the scene arise, “Nor hope, but apprehension meet thine eyes! “Will Fortune, false as the alternate sea, “For thee perpetual flow, alone for thee? “High the ascent her hourly favourites know, “But steep the precipice that sinks below; “One step alone 'twixt triumph and defeat, “The gulphy ruin and the towery height. “Say, Chief! should Nile with all his dread allies, “Potent of wealth and arms, in vengeance rise; “The Turk, the Persian, and Cassano's heir, “Frown in the van, and deepen in the rear; “What mortal power could such a storm asswage, “Or check the thunder launch'd in all its rage? “Perhaps, to western aid thy prospects bend; “Aid from the Greek,—that tried, that trusty friend! “Yes, yes, his faith attesting nations own; “'Tis Punic all, and to a proverb known! “His plighted powers we then may learn to fear, “When you grow credulous, or he sincere; “When those who late thy peaceful march withstood, “To buy thy progress will expend their blood; “Who late retail'd the venal air for hire, “Fight in thy cause, and at thy side expire. “Shrunk to the limits of this warlike round, “All hope is to thy proper squadrons bound; “To these, who, distant from their native soil, “By death diminish, and decline with toil: “And is it hence, thy brave presumption grows, “To foil the fury of united foes? “Not slight the fray thy former conquests boast, “When with full powers you quell'd each separate host; “How then should such combining hosts dismay, “When Egypt lengthens out their dread array? “Yet, should I yield thee more than man for might, “In terrors drest, invincible in fight, “In heavenly panoply thy warriors cased, “With heavenly ardour every sinew braced; “Still Godfrey, still thy mightier Foe remains, “More fierce than millions on encountering plains— “Go, whirl thy sword, go, launch the impetuous spear, “And let remorseless Famine learn to fear! “Alas! too soon thy matchless force must feel, “That hunger's sharper than the wounding steel. “No harvests here wave hopeful to thy eye; “Consumed around, the blasted pastures lie; “The tiller has himself undone his toil, “Nor left for him to reap, or thee to spoil; “While wasting fires have robb'd thy fainting steed, “And wide devour'd, lest fiercer foes should feed: “Deep guarded battlements the grain immure, “From force defend, and from access secure. “But then your fleet shall waft the large supply, “And seas shall yield, what hostile lands deny; “Yes, you shall live as please the tide and wind, “When gales are constant, and when storms are kind. Yet could thy power the struggling tempest rein, “Direct the blast, and rule the indignant main; “How will thy feeble, thy unequal fleet, “Such joint, such formidable forces meet, “When launch'd around our naval powers unite, “And from the boundless ocean snatch the sight? “Strange is the turn of thy capricious state, “Where double conquest must prevent defeat; “As strange our favouring fate, where one success “Shall with a sure, a double conquest bless: “If we, by land, or sea, thy powers sustain, “Vain are thy powers, by land and ocean vain; “And if by sea, or land, thy forces fail, “By land and sea alike our arms prevail. “In vain by land the fruitless field you boast, “When Famine triumphs o'er thy conquering host; “In vain thy fleet shall waft the plenty o'er, “Thy conquering fleet, when armies are no more. “If yet, nor love, nor interest can invite, “And only wars remorseless wars delight, “How has thy soul her former praise disclaim'd, “Through every clime, for every virtue famed! “But ah, if war thy milder thoughts deform, “May Heaven with gentle hand appease the storm; “Through Asia may the horrid conflicts cease, “And Godfrey rule the conquer'd realms in peace! “And you! whose arms, in dubious battle tried, “The virtues of your matchless Chief divide, “Who share, alike, his council and his care, “Who every toil and every peril share; “Let Heavenly Peace the swelling passion sway, “Nor smiling Fortune, faithless fair, betray. “The mariner, though sails and cordage torn, “Thro' sands, and rocks, and whirling eddies born, “At length within the friendly haven cast, “With transport sees that every danger's past: “Escaped like him the trusty port retain, “Nor tempt the future tempest on the main.” He ended smooth; but, through the warlike round, Of deep disgust the murmuring accents sound; Impassion'd gestures all their soul avow, And indignation bends in every brow. Thrice and again, his quick discerning view The Chief around his circling heroes threw; And thus sedate the much experienced man, With gentle but determined voice began. “Aletes! deep thy art, and smooth thy phrase; “And well you mix the menace with the praise. “If, in sincerity, as it should seem, “Our acts are honour'd with your king's esteem, “You may assure the monarch, on our part, “Of all due deference, and a grateful heart. “But where your words with threatening ardour warm, “Collect all Asia in the coming storm, “I answer in my plain accustom'd style, “Not graced with eloquence, yet free from guile. “Know then, that all our suffering powers sustain, “Thro' hostile climes, and the tempestuous main, “Sole centering to one glorious object tends, “And only leads where all our labour ends— “To free yon sacred, venerable wall! “Let every threat, let every ruin fall, “Nor death can terrify, nor toil distress, “Since Heaven with future recompence will bless. “'Tis not the transient gust of mortal joys, “Gems, crowns, or pageant scepters, glittering toys! “Not Fame in all her pomp of titles drest, “Inspires the fervour of a Christian breast: “Who to the spheres their constant course assign'd, “Alone directs the movements of our mind; “He is the Pole whose fix'd attraction charms, “The Voice that dictates, and the Cause that arms. “His Hand alone the whirling surge restrains, “And o'er his tempest throws the lordly reins. “Alike to us the wintery gusts arise, “Or Syrius fires the equinoctial skies; “Warm'd by his breath, or shaded by his wing, “His Presence tempers our eternal spring. “Smooth'd, where He leads, the strong ribb'd hills subside, “The dangers vanish, and the floods divide; “Low lie proud heads, and every hostile power, “And from its basis smoaks the tumbling tower. “Not from the cumbrous shield, or brittle spear, “Or strength of mortal arm, we hope—or fear; “Nor list, if Grecia, or the world be foes; “We trust a Power, who can alone oppose; “Nor shall the world against our host abide, “Against one man, if Heaven be on his side. “But if, before yon consecrated wall, “His Will, inscrutable, ordains our fall, “Our bones shall mingle with that hallow'd clay, “Where once the Prince of Life, Messiah lay: “So will we fall, triumphant, though o'erthrown; “So will we die!—but, trust me, not alone— “Sad Asia shall the mournful vigil keep, “And (friendless) we will give the foe to weep. “Yet think not we in savage wars delight, “That terms of honourable peace we slight; “Or vain of conquest, equally despise “Such formidable foes, such strong allies. “But why your monarch prop these distant walls, “Where neither interest claims, nor justice calls? “If east, or west, his conquering ensigns bend, “Pleas'd with his power, we rise not to defend; “Still with his glory may his sway increase, “Still may he rule his native realms in peace, “Nor toil to find unnecessary foes, “But take and grant reciprocal repose!” He ceas'd; when, passion maddening in his eye, Argantes in a storm of wrath drew nigh, The impetuous gust disdaining to controul; And thus loosed all the fury of his soul. “Yes, Chief, henceforward let the sword decide; “War is thy wish, nor be thy wish denied. “Ill hast thou answer'd to our terms of peace; “But cause of strife to mortals ne'er can cease.” So saying, quick his flowing garb be seiz'd, And folding with terrific action rais'd: “Here, thou contemner of events!” he cries, “Here, peace and war within my vesture lies. “If war be in thy bold election, say; “Choose as you list, but choose without delay.” Such uttering arrogance, and scornful air, Not likely such a princely round should bear: Incensed, no voice attends their Chief's reply; “War, war!” at once, “War, war!” aloud they cry. With rising wrath the fierce Circassian burn'd, And “War, eternal, mortal war!” return'd. His robe with hasty furious hand exposed, The gates of Janus seem at once disclosed: Peace scared, on trembling pinions urged her flight; And Hate, and Discord, issuing claim'd the light. All dread, and terrible, Argantes stands: Dire as Tiphoius with his hundred hands, Or Babel, that in spite of Heaven arose; So towers the chief, and menaces his foes. With awful grace superior, Godfrey smiled, And thus rejoin'd more menacingly mild. “Our answer let your Memphian monarch hear, “Who better knows to threat, than we to fear— “If here he means we should attend the sight, “Swift be his march, and well assured his might: “Or soon we'll wait him on Egyptian soil; “For we are, haply, more inured to toil. The Hero spoke, and gracefully humane Dismiss'd the chiefs with their attending train: Aletes had a helm of richest price, With plumage proud, the beamy spoil of Nice: But to Argantes' mightier hand he gave A massy sword, fit present for the brave; Though gold the hilt, and gem'd with costliest stone, Superior to the mass the model shone; Curious to view, but ponderous 'twas to feel, And like a meteor gleam'd the lengthening steel. The bounty, quick, the proud Circassian took, Eyed with delight, and with dread action shook: “Soon Bulloign! much too soon,” he cried, you'll find, “Such trust was ne'er to better hands assigned.” They parted thus; and to his peer addrest, Argantes spoke the boldness of his breast: “Go thou to Egypt with the morning light; “I go to Sion, and I go this night. “My pen or presence to no end conduce, “Where deeds are dead, and only words of use: “Talk is thy province, and may have its charms; “Be mine the war, the nobler clash of arms!” Brief spoke the Pagan, nor reply attends, But turn'd with haughty step to Salem bends; The dictates of his swift impetuous soul No rites of embassy, no laws controul: Beneath the glimmering of the starry ray, Impatient he directs his warlike way; While warm in every act, and every thought, Contention bled, and future combats fought. And now still night, diffused to either pole, From heaven her balmy visitation stole; With soft constraint the drowsied sense opprest, And weigh'd the weary bustling world to rest. Through nature, peace and short oblivion reign: The tempest slumbers on the silent main; Hush'd through the sylvan shade, and dreary den, Smooth lake, and peopled flood, and willow'd fen, Each foot, and fin, and feather, finds repose; With gentler pace each lazy current flows; Exiled from every heart Oppression fled, And Labour sunk upon the grateful bed. But not the shade with kindly opiate blest, That lull'd the remnant of the world to rest, Nor toil persuasive of profound repose, Through Godfrey's camp could give an eye to close: Impatience hangs upon the lingering night, Counts the long hour, and claims the promised light; Still through the gloom exploring looks essay The dawning whiteness of the eastern ray, That shall o'er long-sought Solyma arise, And give her spires to their expecting eyes: BOOK III. The eastern breeze, fresh harbinger of dawn, Sprung from the surge, and whisper'd o'er the lawn: Aurora waked, suffused with early dew, And round her form the purpling vesture threw; Her orient locks increasing glory shed, And Eden's rose adorn'd her radiant head. The soldiers arm; ten thousand shouts arise, Ring through the camp, and burst upon the skies; Triumphant clarions answer to the sound, And boundless joy and clamour pours around. Wild were the transports of the madding host, Wild as the waves on the Trinacrian coast, Or winds that o'er the ridgy mountain sweep, That rend the clouds, and rush upon the deep: Yet to their Chief the ranging troops conform, He rules the rapture, and directs the storm; In ordered file arrays the impetuous train; Rapid they march, but rapid with the rein. Wing'd were their hearts, with previous transport fleet, And wing'd, like feather'd Mercury, their feet; Nor travel tires, nor obstacles impede, So warm their ardour and so swift their speed. But when careering up the etherial road, The disk of heaven with rising fervour glow'd, Jerusalem the ravish'd squadrons spy, “Jerusalem!” triumphing thousands cry; Jerusalem, their acclamations sweet, Expanding arms, and reaching raptures, greet. So when beneath the keen Septentrion pole, Or where the tides of Austrial oceans roll, Adventurous mariners, a desperate band, Roam in the search of yet untrodden land, Where skies unknown the dreary prospect bound, With gulphs that gape, and storms that rage around; If, haply, now some azure hill they spy, How is the voice responsive to the eye! Their cheeks with mutual gratulation glow, And shouts in scorn dismiss all former woe. To the first hurry of that wild delight When Salem rose transporting to their sight, Contrition soon with reverent check succeeds; With dulcet anguish every bosom bleeds: Their humble eyes all trembling they with-hold From walls too dear, too aweful to behold, Where Christ his seat of mortal passion chose, Expiring suffer'd, and renew'd arose: Griefs, joys, unknown, their mingling soul possest, And thrill'd the nerve in every martial breast. Soft is their step along the sacred ground, And hoarse and deep the murmuring accents sound— Hoarse as the rustling of autumnal breeze; Deep as the break of rough asswaging seas, Where denser woods the shattering blast oppose, Or craggy shores the surging spume enclose. The warriors, by their Chief's example led, With naked feet the sultry causeway tread; Of boastful trim their arms they all divest, And all unplumed is every bending crest; Timid their voice, and sweet their whispering woe, Short breathe their sighs, and fast their eyes o'erflow, While thus the penitent, the dear distress, Low faultering tongues and speaking hearts express: “O Lamb! who here for all the living died, “Love's purple fountain issuing from thy side, “Whose currents through the Maze of Mercy ran, “To wash the ways, the sinful ways of man; “Receive, receive the contrite tears we shed, “Due tribute where our Suffering Saviour bled; “Nor common tears should thy memorial keep, “But pour'd to Thee our bleeding hearts should weep!” Mean-while, the watch, who, from his towery stand, In spacious prospect held the neighbouring land, To right, to left, slow gathering on the skies, Perceived wide wreaths of curling dust arise. As fraught with coming storm when clouds ascend And sable wing'd from north to east extend, The nimble lightnings pour upon the sight, And the dark vapour labours with the light; So, thro' the eclipse, shields, helms, and corslets gleam, Thick ported spears project a quivering beam, With man and steed the wide-womb'd cloud is fill'd, And glittering arms the sleinted region gild. The hasty sentinel the town alarms— “To arms, ye citizens,” he cries, “to arms! “Heavens! what a horrid cloud involves the sky! “What ranks of steely war, what hosts I spy! “Up, up, the foe's at hand; your walls ascend; “Your law, your lives, your native rights defend!” The female's feeble sex, and silver'd sage, Too soft by nature, or unnerved by age, With trembling infants to the mosques repair, And tire their Prophet with a length of prayer. But those of limb assured, and courage bold, Seiz'd their keen weapons with a hasty hold: Some run to line the portals, some the wall; The King informs, directs, and governs all. Then to a tower that brow'd the northern coast, And front to front o'erlook'd the approaching host, His city here, and here his foe in view, The Monarch, to inspect the whole, withdrew. Erminia, to his royal house allied, Erminia, gentle charmer! graced his side, Whom late (her kingdom seiz'd, and slain her sire) The victor's chain permitted to retire. Mean-time Clorinda issuing at their head, The force of many a gallant warrior led; While, with his squadron couch'd, Argantes lay, Prepared to sally, and sustain the day. Clorinda's daring voice each ear inspired; Each eye, her warlike presence fill'd, and fired: “This day,” she cried, “let grateful Asia bless, “That to our arms assigned the first success.” She said—when strait appear'd a Christian band, Whose search with early forage scour'd the land, And now returning with the lowing prey, To the main host they held their hasty way. The Virgin, by intemperate valour push'd, Full on the troop, but first on Guardo, rush'd, Their mighty leader, famed for strength in fight, But much too weak to match her matchless might: Him from his seat, in either army's view, O'erturn'd behind his steed Clorinda threw; Glad omen hence the Pagan hosts portend, And shouts, by shouts upborn, to heaven ascend: But she, where join'd the thickest squadrons, prest, Cleft the bright helm and tore the plaited breast; Her men fast followed on the road she made, And fought secure beneath her conquering shade. Repeal'd with speed, the Christians quit the spoil, And step by step their shatter'd powers recoil; Till the kind summit of a hill they gain'd, And rallying thence the stronger foe sustain'd: When lo! impetuous as loosed whirlwinds rise, Or the red bolt that shoots athwart the skies, His arms and eager eyes ejecting flame, Far wing'd before his squadron Tancred came. As in a tempest stands some stable mast, Braced to the board yet labouring in the blast; So great, so firm, the spear which Tancred takes, Sits in his grasp, and in his anger shakes. The King beheld him dreadful in his charms, Blooming in strength, and eminent in arms. His presence fill'd the careful Monarch's breast, Who thus Erminia, trembling maid, addrest: “Well should thy eye, through long acquaintance, know “The hated shape of each distinguish'd foe; “Say then, what's he, whose hot and warlike form “Before him sends the terror of a storm?” He said; nor answer save the sigh received, That in the whiteness of her bosom heaved, That half supprest in its sweet prison lay, And through her lips half wing'd its odorous way; While round her eyes the crimson circlets glow'd, And bright, within, the liquid anguish flow'd. At length o'er Love she threw Aversion's cloke, And thus, with feign'd yet real passion, spoke: “Ah me! too well, too well his form I know “Whose steed so proudly bears my deadliest foe; “Him from my eyes not mingling hosts can hide, “Him from my thoughts nor time nor place divide. “Great Prophet! in what heaps from Antioch's wall, “Beneath that arm I saw my people fall! “The wound he gives no mortal may endure, “No armour ward, and ah!—no med'cine cure. “Tancred his name,—O! cruel,—may he live, “And 'scape the death he knows too well to give, “Till captive once, and to my rage assigned, “He feels how strait a woman's chains can bind: “A thousand deaths my vengeful thoughts prepare, “And one, which Heaven avert! would only spare.” She said; involuntary sighs expire, And just, though great, the Monarch deem'd her ire; But ah! how sweet the vengeance she designed! How soft the fetters! and the rage how kind! Mean time Clorinda eyed the warrior's speed, And full to thwart the tempest urg'd her steed. Couch'd at the head each aim'd a deadly stroke; Her weapon, shiver'd to the gauntlet, broke: But the rude welcome of the hero's spear, Nor silken thongs nor golden buckles bear; From her fair front the plumed helm he cast, Her hair dishevelling revell'd in the blast; Gem'd in the curling radiance shone her face, The fiercest ardor and the sweetest grace. Forth from her glance keen flash'd the living fire; Ah! what her smiles—since lovely was her ire? Why, Tancred! wherefore stops thy late career? Here's but one foe, and can the mighty fear? Or can a face like spelful magic charm, Freeze the bold nerve, and chain the lifted arm? Yes, Tancred's eye bears witness to his heart, And owns a charm beyond the mystic art; Still on that heart, indelibly imprest, Still lived that form which now his eyes confest: The shade, ill sheltering, to his soul returns, And gazing now, as at the fount he burns. Her shield she rais'd, and on the warrior flew; Fierce she advanced, and gentle he withdrew: On other foes he would his force have tried; But “Here! turn here!” the threatful Virgin cried. Ah, barbarous Maid! one death would not suffice; Thy sword would trace the progress of thy eyes. Furious she strikes, while faintly he defends, And only to her killing face attends. “Ah,” thought the Chief, “sweet combatant forbear! “'Tis not thy sword that Tancred knows to fear; “Far deeper than the wounds thy arms impart, “Thou'st found the way to reach thy soldier's heart. “Strong though thy arm, the strongest arm may fail; “But fate is in thy eyes, and must prevail. Yet, e're he died, determined yet to tell, Why thus the unresisting victim fell; Half timorous, half embolden'd by despair, With troubled accent he addrest the Fair: “If the steel'd ranks of this embattel'd field, “No apter object of thy prowess yield; “If me alone thy vengeance would pursue, “Thy valour combat, and thy arms subdue; “Hence from the mingling hosts with me retire, “And prove whose arm can best express our ire.” The Maid assented, though unhelm'd her head, And rode intrepid where the challenge led. And now she aim'd, and now discharg'd a stroke, When, scarce preventing, thus the warrior spoke: “Hold! lovely heroine, hold! and let thy rage “First hear the terms that won me to engage.” She staid; his faultering tongue despair made bold, And gave the love long latent to unfold: “Ah my fair foe,” the impassion'd Tancred cried, “Since peace is in thy endless wrath denied. “The terms of war to speedy conquest lead, “Give you to strike and me alone to bleed; “Too blest, if so I may thy rage appease, “And learn, so hap'ly, learn in death to please. “Long since, the joys of irksome life are fled, “Nor mine the heart you pierce, or blood you shed: “Mistaken Maid! in every part you reign, “And pour the vital flood through every vein. “Of me, more nearly than thyself, possest, “Thine's all the interest in thy Tancred's breast! “See to thy sword his bosom I impart; “Too well thou know'st thy passage to the heart— “Strike, strike! it leaps to bleed at thy command, “And welcomes death endear'd beneath thy hand.” Yet, Tancred! further had thy lips essay'd, And haply touch'd the much admiring Maid; But here, by luckless interruption, led, Before their foes some routed Paynims fled. A Gallic soldier, as he past the Fair, Mark'd the bright flow of her redundant hair; His coward hand the base advantage seiz'd, And high in air the cruel steel he rais'd; But Tancred on his weapon caught the stroke, And the first force of its encounter broke; Yet lightly edg'd the glancing sabre bit, Where the fair head and pillar'd neck were knit. As when, prepared some regal brow to grace, Or raise the lustre of some fair one's face, An artist bids the golden circlets shine, And calls the ruby from the blushing mine; So the bright drops of bleeding crimson shew'd, And gem'd amid her mingling tresses glow'd. Then, then, no limit Tancred's fury knew, But launch'd in vengeance on the ruffian flew; As swiftly loosed to flight he urg'd his steed, For instant fear gave feathers to his speed. Suspensed a-while, and much at both amazed, On the strange chase the thoughtful Virgin gazed; But turn'd, she saw her shatter'd squadrons yield, And changed the fortune of the flying field: With shame, grief, rage, all kindling at the sight, She rush'd to turn her routed bands from flight; Now, singly bold, against a host made head, And now, o'erpower'd by pressing numbers, fled; Yet mutual flight to her pursuers taught, For still she flew, and as she fled she fought. As on the wilds of Plessa's bordering wood, Or where broad Volga rolls a deepening flood, The savage Ure, by circling mastiffs prest, Shakes the dread dewlap of his bellowing chest; Outnumber'd, now prepares his flanks for flight, Now wheeling lifts his horny front in fight; Clorinda so, half chasing, and half chased, Repelling, and repell'd, now fled, now faced; When flying fear'd, and fatal tho' pursued, She rather seem'd subduing than subdued. The Pagans, push'd before the Christian powers, Now reach'd the bases of their sheltering towers; Whence rallied, for the field again they burn, And with a shout upon their hunters turn. Mean time Argantes with his troop impends, And plumed in horror from the mount descends. Well might the stoutest tremble at the sight, For fearful rush'd the giant famed in fight: Pierc'd by his sword, or by his lance o'erthrown, The prostrate ranks beneath his fury groan; Deform'd, the battle bleeds at every vein, And man and steed lie tumbled on the plain. With equal death Clorinda heap'd the field, And made the pride of manly prowess yield. Ardelio, whose brave spirit, warm though sage, Felt a fresh spring in his autumnal age, With rash essay adventuring to repel, A victim to the fond presumption fell. Two sons he had who felt their father's fire, Two valiant sons to guard a valiant sire; But wounded lay the brave Alcander's might, And scarce was Poliphernes saved by flight. But Tancred, who untimely o'er the plain Pursued the ruffian, but pursued in vain, Now turning saw the unequal combat waged, And his brave troop by circling hosts engaged: With double grief his error pierc'd his sight, But double valour would restore the fight; He ran, he shot, confirm'd his fainting bands, Recall'd their hearts, and fortified their hands. Nor he alone; for now, by Dudon led, The Adventurous Troop their dreaded ensigns spread. Strength of their strength, and in himself a host, Their flower, their nerve, their beauty, and their boast, Whom by his mien and arms Erminia knew, Before the foremost young Rinaldo flew. “Behold,” she cried, “behold Rinaldo there, “Than man more valiant, more than woman fair! “Whose fame is full e're promise could presage, “And shames in infancy the toils of age. “His arm more forceful than an engine falls, “And threats more ruin to these tottering walls. “Had Europe sent six champions to the field, “Six boys like this could ample Europe yield, “The world were conquer'd to the southern pole; “Beneath their yoke should India's Ganges roll, “In chains all Niger's tawny kings should tread, “And Nile in vain would hide his sacred head. “But turn where Dudon thy attention claims, “Who there in gold and mingling verdure flames! “He rules yon band whose actions task belief, “Where every soldier is himself a chief; “Yet justly his experienced step precedes, “And hundreds that were born to empire leads. “Lo there (unprais'd who in his prowess prides) “The brother of imperial Norway rides, “Gernando, whose huge stature loads the plain! “What boots to say he's valiant, since he's vain?” “But here, O king, in radiant silver drest, “Fair as the faith that whitens in their breast, “Behold, ah sweet associates! side by side, “Two friends espoused, the lover and the bride; “Gildippe, Edward, paradised in bliss, “Her Edward that, and his Gildippe this! “No force can foil them, and no fate can part, “Famed in the fight, and wedded in the heart.” While thus she gave due honour to the foe, Wild was the riot in the vale below: For now in Tancred and Rinaldo's ire, The slaughter rages and the ranks expire; Through the firm depth of hemming foes they broke, And some arm'd Paynim died on every stroke; Not even Argantes could the shock sustain, But, fallen beneath Rinaldo, spread the plain. And now, O mighty Chief, in arms surpast, This thy first foil had haply proved thy last, But chance deprived the victor of his prey, Who prest beneath his prostrate courser lay. Mean-time pale fear deform'd the face of fight, And, mingling, wing'd the Pagan feet for flight; All, save Argantes and the martial Maid, Who still to stem the conquering army staid; The bank and bulwark of their host they rose, And each stood equal to a thousand foes. Nor so restrain'd, the impetuous Dudon flew, Still urged the chace, and still the hindmost slew: Swift, as the victor by Tigranes past, Lopp'd from the trunk the headed helm he cast: What, Corban, what, Algazar, could avail, Your casque well temper'd, and your circling mail? For his keen sword cleft Corban to the chest, And through Algazar's back transfix'd the breast: Beneath his steel Mahammed prest the plain, Almanzer's bulk was number'd with the slain: Before the Chief great Amurath expired, And even Argantes slow, and stern, retired. With bridled wrath the indignant warrior burn'd, He labour'd, raged, withdrew, stopp'd, chafed and turn'd; Till now the wish'd advantage he essay'd, And in brave Dudon's bosom sheathed the blade; Prone o'er the field his sullied armour rung, And o'er his eyes the eternal slumber hung. Thrice, to the cheer of heaven's all-dulcet light, He lift the pain'd and sickly lids of sight; And thrice, vain toil, he struggled to arise, And thrice he fell, and closed his umber'd eyes: From the cold limbs the vital heat retired, And in a parting sigh his soul expired. Back stepp'd the stern Circassian from the dead, And shook the reeking steel, and scornful said: “Go, warriors, let the generous Godfrey know, “What quick effusions from his bounty flow! “When to our arm this weapon he assigned, “Wise was the trust, as sure the gift was kind; “Nor can he learn, without a secret pride, “To what rare use his favours are applied: “Freely he gave, nor I his bounty spare, “Which here return'd his foremost champions share: “Yet, tell him, yet I languish for that day, “When hand to hand I shall in person pay. He spoke, when hundreds on the boaster prest, And launch'd a mingling tempest at his breast; But prudence timely prompted to evade, And the tall towers held forth their friendly shade. Now, shower'd tempestuous from the embattel'd wall, Stones, darts, and flints, and engined quarries fall; Wing'd from the nerve of many a bending bow, Death points a cloud and rains the storm below; The Christian powers receding seek the plain, And their wide gates the cover'd Pagans gain. When disencumber'd now Rinaldo rose, To vengeance loosed he pour'd upon his foes; For Dudon's fate had reach'd the warrior's ear, And gave a fury which e'en friends might fear. “On, on!” he cried, “why, wherefore stop? O shame! “Your arms, revenge, revenge and Dudon claim. “In vain their ramparts veil yon trembling rout, “Walls rise in vain to keep the valiant out; “Though fenced with adamant, or towers of steel, “Argantes should my entering vengeance feel.” He said, and forward on the ramparts sprung; A storm of darts around his temples sung: Yet he gave all his dauntless front to view; Even danger awed before his eye withdrew; The towers appear'd to totter at the sight, And quailing thousands trembled from their height. But Sigiere now by royal Godfrey sent, (Sage herald) bade the rage of war relent: “Retire, retire, nor vainly hope,” he cried, “That one day's arm shall Salem's fate decide: “Steep are her towers and boldly mann'd her walls; “And dire must be the shock by which she falls.” They staid reluctant—As the fiery steed Rein'd in his pride and lorded in his speed, So fared Rinaldo's fury, scarce represt; And still the battle struggled in his breast. Mean-time, with dust deform'd and stain'd with gore, Brave Dudon from the fated field they bore; The soldiers press to touch his great remains, And round his corse the copious sorrow rains. But Bulloign, from a summit's neighbouring height, Survey'd fair Solyma's imperial site; Her powers, her force, and her defects he scann'd, And the deep schemes of future conquest plann'd. High eminent amid the circling lands, Fair Solyma in ancient glory stands: Rear'd on two hills her regal spires arise; Between, a vale in rich expansion lies: From three proud sides she overlooks her foe, And smiles, impervious, on the war below; But, weak by nature on the northern part, She stoops to arm her in the strength of art. The frugal trough and cistern's vase retain Her watery stores of heaven descending rain; Around her walls no lively verdures grow; Few founts to slake the sultry region flow; No grove extends its hospitable shade To the tired pilgrim or the feverish glade, Save where, two leagues divided from the town, A baleful forest rears its umbrage brown, Whose silent shades in antique horrors rise, Brood o'er the soil, and intercept the skies. Clear to the dawning of the eastern beam, The hallow'd Jordan pours a plenteous stream; A sanded billow bounds the western side, And rolls alternate on the midland tide; Samaria stretch'd upon the north expands, Where Bethel in opprobrious prospect stands; But Bethlem, Israel's gem and Judah's boast, Rears to the south, and consecrates the coast. While Bulloign thus surveys the hostile ground, And sends his eye in large experience round, Metes the proud height of Sion's tower'd wall, Marks her defects and meditates her fall; Erminia intermitted silence breaks, And thus observant of the Hero speaks. “Behold, O King, in regal purple drest, “Strength in his arm, and wisdom in his breast, “Behold where Godfrey takes his aweful stand, “All form'd for fame, to act as to command! “In him the hero and the sage unite, “The clue of conduct, and the force of fight: “Raimond alone, of yon unnumber'd hosts, “A rival in the nightly council boasts; “Alike young Tancred's and Rinaldo's charms, “Their flame of courage, and their force of arms! “I know,” the Monarch with a sigh replied, “I know him well, and saw his prowess tried. “When I the seals of Egypt's sultan bore, “And trod a friend upon the Gallic shore, “A stripling in the lists, he struck my eyes, “And matchless bore from every arm the prize; “Then, e're his spring of bearded down began, “In every excellence a more than man: “Too sure presages of impending woe “To such, whom fate should mark for Bulloign's foe! But say, what's he, whose scarf with Tyrian pride, “Flows o'er his arms and glows at Godfrey's side? “Though Godfrey treads superior to the sight, “In mien and majesty they both unite. “I see, 'tis Baldwin,” cried the princely Dame, “His brother, less in features, than in fame. “But mark, intently turn'd how Godfrey hears, “While Raimond speaks the judgment of his years, “Whose hostile hairs bring terrors to my sight, “Grown sage in war, and in experience white; “Beyond ten thousand hands that head alarms, “The ward and leading wisdom of their arms. “There William, England's younger hope, behold, “His figured buckler, and his casque of gold! “Guelfo the next, whose thirst of glory springs “From a long race of heroes and of kings; “I know him well, amid a host exprest, “By his square shoulders and his ample chest. “But ah! in vain I send my eyes about, “To find my foe the cruel Boemond out; “The dire usurper, whose relentless hand “Slew my great sire, and seiz'd my native land!” Thus while they spoke observant of the foe, The Duke descends, and joins his host below: For now resolv'd, and hopeless to prevail Where Salem's eminence o'erlook'd the vale, Incumbent on the opener north he lay, Spread out his camp, and made his engines play, Where every rampart shook beneath his power From the far portal to the utmost tower— In compass near a third; for such the space That circles Sion in a wide embrace; Not with thin ensigns lengthening tow'rd the mound, Could Godfrey's army hem the wondrous round: Yet every lane and every pass he barr'd, And fix'd the frequent terrors of a guard; Around his camp the spacious lines he drew, And broad and deep his guardian trenches threw, To shield his legions from untimely fight, And every dark hostility of night. These orders given, the General held his way Where Dudon, much lamented hero, lay: High on a bier, with warlike honours graced, In woful pomp the Great Remains were placed; Snapp'd arms and sable ensigns spread the ground, And mingling princes pour'd their griefs around. At Bulloign's sight, the sadly silent croud, Renew'd in rising sorrows, wept aloud; But he, with majesty that bore the show Of dirge in triumph, or of cheer in woe, Approaching, touch'd the bier, represt his grief; And thus pathetic spoke the mourning Chief. “Hail Dudon! hail to thy eternal birth, “Revived in Heaven from all thy toils on earth! “Nor yet shall Heaven the total hero claim, “Still found on earth, immortal in his fame! “In life, my friend, in death thou didst excel; “Valiant you fought, and valiantly you fell! “Closed is thy warfare, finish'd is thy fight, “And stars of living glory crown thy might! “Not, not for thee, this sable cloud of woe; “But for ourselves our juster sorrows flow: “Our arm of war's unnerv'd upon thy bier, “And broke with thine is every pointless spear; “Despoil'd of thee, thou chiefest earthly aid, “Our banners droop, and all our laurels fade! “Yet the Great Cause that might inform the dead, “The Cause survives, for which thy bosom bled; “Survives to warm thee with its wonted charms, “And wing thy soul assistant to our arms, “When in the powers of heavenly mission bright, “Once more thou shalt descend to rule the fight, “In terrors wrap'd to thunder on the foe, “To lay the pride of all oppressors low, “To raze the height of yon embattel'd wall, “And lift thy friends victorious from thy fall!” He said—And now the slumberous dew of night Mix'd with the shade, and sunk upon the sight; O'er care-swoln lids effused the balm of sleep, And closed those eyes that daily learn'd to weep. But Bulloign on his pensive pillow lay, Revolv'd through every labour of the day, While forming in his wakeful round of thought Machines arose, and novel combats fought. The bright-eyed morn from early vapour won, Saw Godfrey arm'd, and orient with the sun; At Dudon's herse, the friendly melting Chief Pour'd the last tribute of attending grief. Him a long train of funeral pomp convey'd, And low in earth the warrior's corse they laid, Where a tall palm its branching honours spread, Wove in the wind, and worship'd o'er the dead; His dust the priestly consecration blest, And sung the great departed soul to rest. High o'er his tomb, amid the branches strung, Ensigns, and arms, and blazon'd trophies hung, The pride and spoils of many a valiant knight, Seiz'd by the Victor in his days of fight. Full on the trunk his proper arms were placed, His plumy helm the joining corslet graced; And thus the marble bore his sacred name— “Here Dudon lies—yet fills the world with fame.” The last sad rites of social woes exprest, And Dudon left to his eternal rest, The Chief of chiefs, on public cares intent, A convoy to the secret forest sent, Where silent grew its unfrequented shade, Now by a Syrian to the Duke betray'd, Who meditates from hence on Sion's fall, And plans machines the rivals of her wall. The Woodmen now dispose their ranging bands, The alternate axe high brandish'd in their hands; Unwonted noise the affrighted forest fills, And Echo sighs from all the circling hills. Beneath their strokes the victor palms subside; Down falls the pine from its aerial pride; Still breathes the cedar o'er a length of ground; The firs in weeping amber mourn around; Fell'd with her elm the viney consort lies, And faithful o'er the folded trunk she dies. The poplar, beech, and alder's watery shade, Sink on the marsh, or wither o'er the glade: Imperial oaks, that, through ten ages past, Had braved heaven's bolt and rough encountering blast, The period now of mortal glory feel, And fall subdued beneath the conquering steel: The exiled pard abjures his wonted den, And every feather flies the voice of men: Wide lie the realms of long usurping night, And scenes unfold that never saw the light! CONSTANTIA: OR, The MAN of LAW's TALE, Modernized from CHAUCER. Hence Want, ungrateful visitant, adieu! Pale empress hence, with all thy meager crew— Sour Discontent, and mortified Chagrin, Lean hollow Care, and self-corroding Spleen; Distress and Woe, sad parents of Despair, With wringing hands, and ever rueful air; The tread of Dun, and Bum's alarming hand, Dire as the touch of Circe's circling wand; Keen Hunger with his sharp but famish'd eye, And dusky Theft, a desperate prompter nigh; While agues shudder to the whistling gale, And jointly Law and Infamy assail! But worse, O worse, than all the hideous train, Hot-mouth'd Reproach, and saucy writhed Disdain! These in the rear of thy assembly wait; Still point the anguish, and augment the weight. The worst oppression, who, ah! who could bear, If Virtue, hovering angel, was not there? Where Poverty her blasting progress bends, The Goddess with superior wing attends: Around the Fair her blest associates play, Bask in her eye, and whiten in her ray— Bright Purity, with firm unalter'd cheek, The mild, the kind, the gentle, and the meek; Humility's benignly placid grace, And Innocence with sweet seraphic face; Calm Piety that smiles amidst the storm, And Charity with boundless wishes warm. Bold in the front, to guard the Heavenly Band, Behold the masculine adherents stand! Patience, with Atlantean shoulders spred; Hail Temperance, on thrifty viands fed; Firm Fortitude, unknowing how to yield; And Perseverance with his batter'd shield; And honest Industry, whose early toil Wins health and plenty from the labour'd soil. The genuine Arts behind the Goddess wait, Her reign illustrate, and improve her state: With eye elate here Contemplation soars, And Learning piles his intellectual stores; Here mental sciences arranging shine; Here manual crafts the various task design; While Diligence the busy finger plies, And wing'd, from rank to rank, Invention flies. Such wide extremes on Indigence attend! There Vice assails, the Virtues here defend: Below, the gloom of every passion storms; Above, calm Virtue moderates and reforms; Here, highly elevate; there, deep depress; And give, or bliss, or anguish, in excess. Hail Virtue! Chaste Eternal Beauty, hail! Still on the foe, O Goddess, still prevail! The world, e're framed, lay open to thy view; You form'd the whole, and shall again renew! E're I thy arduous pleasing toils decline, Be Want, ah, still be each disaster mine; Till even Oppression be itself subdued, Nor yet a wish for wealth or power intrude! Nor be the Poor alone thy favourite care; Fly, fly to courts, and let the Mighty share! The silken lethargy at once awake; Debauch from his intemperate opiate shake; Thence every vice, and every folly drive, That sting or glitter round the gorgeous hive. Before thy touch let Insolence retire, And Vanity, an empty breath, expire; Hypocrisy cast off the fair disguise, And starting in his native gloom arise. Now, Goddess, entering, view the dome of state! Do thou inform, and give me to relate; Let demons obvious to my eye appear, (Which known, could sure find no admittance here.) Amid the buzzing, busy, idle croud, The mix'd assembly of the mean and proud, See, Treason smiles, a suitor to his king; See, Promise flutters on a Cypress wing; Her pinion like autumnal foliage falls, And on the pavement Disappointment crawls. A friendly aspect Enmity assumes; Beneath applause, deep lurking Envy glooms; The tempting mammon Subornation shows; And in the patriot's zeal Dissention glows. Oppression there with gently winning grace, And Ignorance with solemn thinking face, And Pride with mortified and Christian guise, And Infidelity with saintly eyes, Four rival-candidates, their monarch sue; Two for the Bench, and for the Mitre two. Lo there Ambition, from his height elate! And Pleasure lolling on a couch of state! On these the pageantry of pomp attends; To these the idolizing tumult bends; The poor, the rich, the peasant, and the peer, And all religions, join in worship here. Ambition, reaching from his airy stand, Grasps at a globe that shuns his desperate hand: Around the glittering sphere, confusedly gay, Crowns, truncheons, gems, and trophied radiance lay; But changing with alternate light and shade, The lures appear, and vanish, shine, and fade; Vain as the cloudy meteor of the morn, Which fancy forms, and transient rays adorn. The prime rewards four suppliant sons of fame, Lust, Rapine, Violence, and Slaughter, claim; And tho' essential happiness is due, For toys the Wise, for toys the Virtuous sue. Deluded men, the ready ambush fly! Dire lurking deaths behind Ambition lie— The mourning block, keen axe, and racking wheel, The poison'd goblet, and the bosom'd steel! Here Pleasure on her velvet-couch reclines, Smiles to undo, and in destruction shines; With seeming negligence displays her charms; The strong she withers, and the steel'd disarms. Imagination, specious handmaid, waits, And serves a pomp of visionary cates: The Sorceress still essays the fresh repasts; But mock'd eternally, she feeds, and fasts. Around her couch unnumber'd votaries meet, And wish to share the imaginary treat; Devour each morsel with desiring eye, And for large draughts of fancied nectar sigh: A thousand nymphs of wanton sprightly mien, Trip round the sofa, and amuse their Queen; With transport she surveys the darling train, All daughters of her light fermenting brain: Here Laughter, Mirth, and Dalliance unite, Illusive Joy, and volatile Delight, Conceits, sports, gambols, titillations gay, Hopes that allure, and projects that betray. Prime sister of the inessential bands, Erect, persuasive Expectation stands; On each pursuit she flourishes with grace, And gives a butterfly to lead the chace; Or wafts a bubble on the parting gale, And bids surrounding multitudes assail; With sweets the fond pursuit alone is fraught, The game still vanishes, when once it's caught: Vain is the joy—but not the anguish vain; And empty pleasure gives essential pain: Couch'd as a tyger, watchful to surprize, Grim Death beneath the false enchantress lies; The fiends around invisibly engage, Guilt stings, pains rack, and disappointments rage; Aches, asthmas, cholicks, gouts, convulsions, rheums, Remorse that gnaws, and languor that consumes. Far other train, Apparent Queen! you lead; True bliss attends, tho' arduous toils precede: Serene thy bosom, tho' thy brow severe; Pain points thy path, but Heaven is in thy rear. Wondrous the influence thy power supplies, Where triumphs only from oppression rise; Peace springs from passion, and from weakness might; Calm ease from travel, and from pain delight; No sweets that vanish, and no gusts that cloy— Clear is the rapture, and serene the joy; Reflection culls from every labour past, And gives the same eternal bliss to last. Thus, by long trial, and severe distress, You, Virtue! truely, tho' severely, bless; Thro' each tradition, each recorded page, Thro' every nation, and thro' every age, From purpled monarchs to the rural hind, By pain you purified, by toil refined: The mightier weight thy favourite heroes bore; Chief you depress'd, whom chief you meant should soar; Still with the foe gave forces to prevail, And with this Moral form'd the following Tale. While yet the Turk his early claim avow'd, And ruled beneath his scepter, Judah bow'd; A set of worthy wealthy merchants chose The world for trade, and Sion for repose. Here they select the gems of brightest rays, Rich stuffs, wrought silks, and golden tissues blaze; Thro' every climate, and to every gale, They launch the cargo, and expand the sail: Wide, with their name, their reputation grew, And to their mart concurring chapmen drew. The lure of novelty, and thirst of gain, Now points their passage o'er the Midland-main; The Tiber now their spumy keels divide, And stem the flow of his descending tide. To Rome, imperial Rome, the traders came; Rome heard the voice of their preceding fame: Free mart and splendid mansion she affords; Joy crown'd their nights, and elegance their boards. With mutual chat they gratify desire, What's curious now relate, and now enquire; Alike for knowledge, and for wealth they trade, And are with usury in both repaid. But Fame surprized them with a wonder new, Beyond what times of brightest record drew, The poet's fancy, or the lover's tongue; And thus the Darling Excellence she sung. To crown our monarch's age with fond delight, His cares alleviate, and his toils requite, Beyond whate'er paternal wish could crave, Indulgent Heaven a peerless Infant gave: The softer sex her beauteous body forms, But her bright soul each manly virtue warms; Youth without folly, greatness without pride, And all that's firm to all that's sweet allied. Rich as the land by sacred promise blest, Lies the fair vale of her expanded breast; Mild on a Parian pillar turns her head, Her front, like Lebanon, divinely spread; There sit the Chaste, the Placid, and the Meek, And morn smiles fresh upon her open cheek. Babes learn distinction at Constantia's sight, And wither'd age revives to strange delight; Tumultuous wishes breathe along her way, Hands rise, tongues bless, and centering eyes survey; All run to bend the voluntary knee, The blind to hear her, and the deaf to see. Ah! were she born to universal sway, How gladly would the willing world obey? And now with wealthy manufacture stow'd, Launch'd on the tide their freighted vessels rode; The pendants vainly point the favouring gale, Court the weigh'd anchor, and the opening sail, Till first the Fair Perfection they beheld, Who all report, in fatal hour, excell'd: For Syria then they ply the labouring oar, And the crook'd keels divide their native shore. Exulting now they touch the favourite land, Unlade, and moor along the yielding strand. Now duteous, on their youthful Sultan wait, Unfold new treasures, and new tales relate. With usual grace, and curious ear he hears; With usual courtesy, and bounty cheers; The strange, the wondrous narrative admires, And all that's foreign, all that's new requires. Ah, hapless prince, thy further search restrain; Couch'd in the tale, death lurks to entertain! Constantia's charms their raptured tongues disclose; In every word some kindling beauty glows; Her form, her features, mien, and soul they breathe, Unpraise all praise, and leave all terms beneath. Strong Eloquence can picture to the blind, Create new forms, and people all the mind; Can pain or mitigate, can heal or wound, Enchant with sentences, and kill with sound. The fancied sweets his ear impatient drinks; Deep on his soul the Imaged Beauty sinks; Thro' all his thoughts, his powers, she lives, she reigns, Pants in each pulse, and thrills along his veins. Sure, thro' the tracts of yon' celestial maze, Where mystic planets dance, and glories blaze; More wonders typical impress the sky, Than e'er was traced with astrologic eye! There haply, e're his natal hour exprest, First burn'd the flame that glowed within his breast: There might the Nymph with previous beauty bloom, With previous languishment the Youth consume; Expire the victim of successless care; Die e're he lived, and e're he loved despair. There the dear friendly stream, e're Julius bled, Great Brutus to his dearer country shed; With destined tyranny there Pride enslaves, With destined virtue there the Patriot saves; There Pompey glow'd for freedom and for fame, There Socrates, of Greece the pride and shame: Alcides there each horrid monster slew; There triumph'd Sampson, the heroic Jew; There All, or doom'd to save, or to destroy, The chiefs who fought at Thebes, or fought at Troy! Long mourn'd the Youth, with secret woe opprest; The latent vulture prey'd within his breast: Constrain'd at length, nor able to sustain The wasting malady, and mental pain; The sage the bearded pillars of his state He calls, and privily unfolds his fate: “No mean,” he cries, “my cruel stars assign; “Swift death, or else Constantia must be mine!” Alternate, each their hopes, or fears disclose, Invent, reject, and now again propose; While some with mystic rites of wondrous art, Engage to gain the sympathetic heart; By philter'd science, and infernal charms, To win the Bright Perfection to his arms: The abhorrent scheme his generous thoughts disdain, Resolved to die, or justly to obtain; And all their arguments, howe'er renew'd, In rites of nuptial sanctitude conclude. But here again new obstacles appear'd, And much for this their latest hope they fear'd; Fear'd, that diversity of faith, might prove Alike diversity, and breach in love; Nor the Fair Christian e'er consent to wed A prince in Macon's sacred precepts bred. The monarch then, “Ah! wherefore doubt, my friends; “Why yet dispute where love and life depends? “That faith must sure have most prevailing charms, “That gives Constantia to my circling arms: “No obstacles shall bar, no doubts deter; “Nor will I think, that she was form'd to err.” The voice determined, and imperial eye, Leave no pretence for courtiers to reply: With the fond speed of Love's impatience warm'd, Now embassies are sent, and treaties form'd. All zealous to promote the cause divine, The pope, the church, and christian powers combine; The royal long-reluctant parents yield, And contracts are by mutual proxy seal'd. High was the trust the regal writings bore, And solemn the attesting parties swore, That the young Syrian, and his barons bold, Each sex and state, the infant and the old, Should all Messiah's hallow'd faith embrace, And bright Constantia be the bond of grace. We list not here of pompous phrase to say, What order'd equipage prepares the day; Grooms, prelates, peers, and nymphs, a shining train, To wait the beauteous Victim o'er the main: All Rome attend in wish the lovely Maid; And Heaven their universal vows invade. At length the day, the woful day arrives, And every face of wonted cheer deprives; The fatal hour admits no fond delay, That shall the joy from every heart convey. Ye men of Rome! your parting glory mourn; Far from your sight your Darling shall be torn; No more the morn with usual smiles arise, Or with Constantia bless your longing eyes, Of every tongue, of every pen the theme, The daily subject, and the nightly dream! But, O Constantia! say, thou fair distrest, What woes that hour thy lovely soul possest? Its native cheek the bright carnation fled, And charg'd with grief reclined thy beauteous head; To lands unknown those limbs must now repair, Nurs'd in the down of fond paternal care. Peace spread thy nightly couch to sweet repose, Delight around thy smiling form arose, Each scene familiar to thy eye appear'd, And custom long thy native soil endear'd: Eas'd by thy bounty, at thy sight exiled, Grief was no more, or in thy presence smiled; Each rising wish thy glad attendants seiz'd; To give thee pleasure, every heart was pleas'd: But now to strange to foreign climes convey'd, Strange objects must thy loathing sense invade, Strange features to thy weeping eyes appear, Strange accents pierce thy undelighted ear; In distant unacquainted bondage tied, The gilded slave of insolence and pride, Perhaps of form uncouth, and temper base, Thy lord shall clasp thee with abhorr'd embrace. Thus sad the Fair revolv'd; soft sorrows flow, And all her sighing soul was loos'd to woe: “Father!”—she cried,” your fond, your wretched child!— “And you, my mother! you, my mother mild!— “My parents dear, beneath whose kindly view, “Blest by whose looks, your cherish'd infant grew; “When far, O far from your embraces torn, “Will you then think a wretch like me was born? “Shall then your child some sad remembrance claim? “And some dear drops embalm Constantia's name? “Your face—ah cruel fortune, can it be?— “These eyes shall never, never, never see! “For ever parted by the rolling main, “I now must feel a lordly husband's chain; “From every friend, from every joy remove, “And the rough yoke of rude barbarians prove: “But so may Heaven the precious issue bless, “And all find happiness through my distress! “Woman was doom'd, ere yet the world began, “The prey of sorrow, and the slave of man.” She could no more; her voice by sobs supprest, And tears pour'd forth in anguish, told the rest. Wide through the croud the sad contagion flew; Each hoary beard is drench'd with mournful dew; In shortening throbs ten thousand bosoms rise, Grief showers its tempest from ten thousand eyes; Along the shore the deepening groans extend, And louder shrieks the cloudy concave rend: Not through old Rome when desolation reign'd, And bleeding senators her forum stain'd; Not in the wreck of that all dismal night, When Ilion tumbled from her towery height; Such uttering plaints the deep despair betray'd, As now attend the dear departing Maid. To the tall ship, with slow desponding tread, All drown'd in grief the Beauteous Victim's led: She turn'd, and with an aching wistful look, A long farewel of every field she took; “Adieu!” to all the melting croud she cried— “Adieu! Adieu!” the melting croud replied; Her launching bark the mournful notes pursue, And echoing hills return, “Adieu! Adieu!” Here let us leave the Virgin on the main, With all her peerage, and her pompous train; To Syria let the swifter muse repair, And say what cheer prepares her welcome there. The Dame, from whom his birth the Prince derived, Imperial Dowager, had yet survived: Ambitious, greedy of supreme controul, And born with all the tyrant in her soul, At filial government she long repined, Nor yet the reins of secret rule resigned. Her savage sentiments her sex belied, And versed in wiles with deepest statesmen vied; Yet o'er her softning tongue, and soothing face, The subtle varnish spread with easy grace: The Sage discern'd, but still confest her sway; And whom their hearts detest, their fears obey. Tenacious zeal her Prophet's lore revered, The practice scorn'd, but to the text adhered; And far as faith with fury could inflame, She was indeed a most religious dame. When she her Son's determin'd bent perceived, Her breast with cruel agitation heaved; Her call, each hoary, each experienced friend, In haste, and midnight privacy, attend; When dire, amid the dusky throng she rose, And from her tongue contagious poison flows. “Ye peers, ye pillars of our falling state! “Too faithful subjects of a Prince ingrate; “A Son, whom these detesting breasts have fed, “A serpent grown, to your destruction bred! “Say, shall a single hand such patriots awe? “Insult your Prophet, and supplant your Law? “First, Heaven! be all the bonds of nature broke, “E'er I assume the curs'd, the Christian yoke: “For, what import these innovating rites, “But here a living death of all delights? “Such threats as penitence can ne'er appease, “The body's penance, and the mind's disease?— “Yet, were I of some faithful hearts secure, “Not such the malady, but we can cure.” She spoke, and all with swift compliance swear, The glorious deed with all their powers to dare; Her charge though ne'er so bloody to fulfill, Though ne'er so dangerous to effect her will. “Doubt not a birth,” she cried, “so well conceived, “Great acts are more by fraud, than force atchieved; “To gain the conquest we must seem to yield, “And feign to fly that we may win the field. “Let each in public wear a Christian face, “And counterfeit the saintly signs of grace: “What though our skin the sprinkling priest baptize? “Our skin's unsullied, while our hearts despise. “Not such the tricks our bolder hands shall play, “When revels end the unsuspecting day; “Nor such the stream our purpling points shall shed, “When we shall, in our turn, baptize with red. Ah sex! still sweet, or bitter, to extreme; Gloomy as night, or bright as morning beam! No fiend's may with a female's wrath compare; No angel's purity, like woman's fair! To save or damn, for bliss or ruin given, Who has thee feels a hell, or finds a Heaven. Smooth as the surface of the dimpled main, While brooding storms the gathering ruin rein, Her son, with dire dissembling leer she seeks, And in the depth of smiling malice speaks. “My child! tho' froward age is over wise, “Let no offence against a parent rise; “Long habits gain a privilege from time, “And frequent custom mellows every crime: “Repugnant hence I dared to thwart your will; “I fear'd the novelty, I fear'd the ill: “But now, convinced by Christ's superior grace, “His law I reverence, and his faith embrace. “Blest be thy bed! thy bridal transports blest! “Nor you refuse a mother's fond request— “Mine be the joy to entertain the Fair; “To form the festival, be mine the care; “To show the peers who on thy bride attend, “As she in beauty, we in love transcend.” The Royal Youth in silent wonder stood; Joy held his voice, and rapture thrill'd his blood: Around her knees his prostrate arms he threw, And duteous tears distill'd the grateful dew: Her son she rais'd, all innocent of ill, And smiling kist whom soon she meant to kill. At length the Bride, and all her solemn train, Past o'er the danger of the Midland-main: The Main is past, but not the danger o'er; The sea less cruel than the Syrian shore! Applauding crouds the landed Beauty greet, And Judah's peers in rich procession meet; Great was the throng, and splendid the array, And guards arranging lined the glittering way. Such were the triumphs of imperial Rome, When conquest led some darling victor home; While meeting millions his approach withstand, And walls, and trees, and clamber'd roofs, are mann'd. All gem'd in ornaments of curious mode, Gay in the van, the false Sultana rode; Oft to her breast she clasp'd the Heavenly Maid, And wondring oft with cruel gaze survey'd. Last came the Sultan, royal, hapless youth, Grace in his form, and in his bosom truth! The last he came, for timorous love controll'd, He fear'd, and long'd, and trembled to behold: A faint salute his faultering voice supplied; Scarce, “Welcome! O divinely fair!” he cried. He blush'd, and sigh'd, and gazed with wavering view, Nor dared to hope the blissful vision true. Thus onward to a neighbouring town they fared, In purposed pomp, and regal state prepared; And here the old maternal fiend invites, To order'd feasts, and dearly bought delights. Down sit the guests, triumphing clarions blow, Drums beat, mirth sings, and brimming goblets flow; In boundless revel every care is drown'd, And Clamour shouts, and Freedom laughs around. Ah hapless state of every human mind, Wrapt in the present, to the future blind! In the gay vapour of a lucky hour, Light Folly mounts, and looks with scorn on power: Nor sees how swift the tides of fortune flow, The swelling happiness, and ebbing woe; That man, should ne'er indulge, or bliss, or care, The Prosperous triumph, or the Wretch despair; So close, so sudden, each reverse succeeds, And Mischief treads where'er Success precedes. And now the night, with brooding horrors still, Gloom'd from the brow of each adjacent hill; Slow heaved her bosom with distemper'd breath, And o'er her forehead hung the weights of death. Opprest with sleep, and drown'd in fumy wine, The prostrate guards their Regal Charge resign; But far within, still wakeful to delight, The Prince and peers protract the festal night— When from the portal, lo! a sudden gloom Projects its horrors through the spacious room: Fearful and dark the russian bands appear, The dire Sultana storming in the rear. The bloody task invading treason plies: Quick, and at once alarm'd, the nobles rise; But these, as faith or faction led, divide, And traitors most with entering traitors side: Boards, bowls, and seats o'erturn'd, the pavement strow; Of blood with wine the mingling currents flow; Vain is the fear that wings their feet for flight, They fall who basely fly or bravely fight; With screams and groans the echoing courts resound, And gasping Romans bite the traitorous ground. Say, Royal Syrian! in that hour of death, Say, didst thou tamely then resign thy breath? Surprize and shame, and love and boundless rage, Flash from his eyes and in his breast engage. Threatning aloft, his flaming steel he drew, And swift to save his loved Constantia flew; Before his bride a beauteous bulwark stands, Now presses on, and backwards bears the bands: Bold to his aid surviving Romans spring, Some Syrians too could dare to join their king; Invaded late, they in their turn invade, And traitors are with mutual death repaid. But what may courage, what may strength avail, Where still o'erpowering multitudes assail; Where number with increasing number grows, And every sword must match a thousand foes? As melting snows with gradual waste subside, So sink the warriors from their Hero's side: Thin'd are the remnants of his bleeding train, And scarce, but scarce, the unequal strife sustain; Their veins exhausted, and o'ertoil'd their might, And struggling, but to fall the last, they fight. The Monarch thus on every side distrest, And hope extinguish'd in his valiant breast, Turn'd to his Queen, he sent the parting look, And brief the eternal last adieu he took: “Since here,” he cried, “our hapless loves must end, “Where this arm fails, may mightier Heaven defend! “This is my last, my only, fond desire: “Too blest am I, who in thy cause expire.” So saying, with recruited powers he glows, Exalted treads, and overlooks his foes: Of more than mortal size the warrior seems, And terror from his eye imperial streams. The circling host his single voice defies; Amid the throng, with sury wing'd, he flies: Deep bites his sword, in heaps on heaps they fall; Hands, arms, and heads, bespread the sanguin'd hall; Untired with toil, resistless in his course, Disdain gave fury, and despair gave force. As here, and there, his conquering steps he bends, Down his fair form the purpling stream descends; Exhausted nature would persuade to yield, But courage, still tenacious, holds the field. As when the lamp its wavering light essays, The source consumed that fed the vital blaze, Extinguish'd now its kindly flame appears, And now aloft a livelier radiance rears; Subsides by fits, by fits again aspires, And bright, but doubtful, burn its fainting fires; Till recollected to one force of light, Sudden she flashes into endless night— So the brave Youth the blaze of life renews, Reels, stands, defends, attacks, and still subdues; Till every vein, and every channel drain'd, One last effort his valiant arm sustain'd: As lightning swift, he sped the latest blow, And greatly fell, expiring on his foe. As should an oak within some village stand, Young, tall, and straight, the favourite of the land, Beneath the dews of heaven sublime he grows, Beneath his shade the wearied find repose; To deck his boughs each morn the maidens rise, And youths around his form contest the prize: Yet haply if a sudden storm descend, Sway'd by the blast, his beauteous branches bend; But vigorous, to their towering height recoil, Maintain the combat, and outbrave the toil; Till the red bolt with levell'd ruin shoots, And cuts the pillar'd fabrick from the roots: Swift falls the beauty o'er a length of ground; The nymphs and swains incessant mourn around. So did the Youth with living form excel, So fair, so tall, and so lamented, fell! Relenting traitors would revive the dead, And weep the blood their ruthless weapons shed: One tender pang the dire Sultana felt, And nature, spite of hell, compels to melt. While sudden thus each bloody arm suspends, And round their Prince the satiate tumult bends; Regardless of her fate, Constantia goes Thro' pointed javelins, and a host of foes. Amaze before the daring Virgin yields, And Innocence from every weapon shields; Till mourning by the great remains she stood, And o'er her lover pour'd the copious flood: “Ah, valiant arm! a waste of worth in vain! “Ah, Royal Youth,” she cried, “untimely slain! “O! had I perish'd, e're I reach'd thy shore, “The surge devour'd, or watery monsters tore; “To bless the world your worth had yet survived, “Nor I, too fatally beloved, arrived. “'Tis I, who have this dear effusion shed; “For me, for me, a luckless bride, you bled!” So saying—furious, the Sultana cries, “Strike; strike; the source of all our mischief dies!” “Yes, strike!” the bright, the intrepid Maid replies. But vainly this consents, or that commands; Heaven check'd their hearts, and pity bound their hands: At once a thousand javelins rise in air; A thousand wishes whisper,—“Ah, forbear!” Recoiling arms the bloody task refuse, And beauty with resistless charm subdues. Alone relentless, the Sultana cries, “'Tis well, the death she wish'd, may still suffice: “Hence with that form, that knows so well to reign; “Hence with the witch, and plunge her in the main! “Her passage thence to Rome she may explore, “And tell her welcome on the Syrian shore. So saying, quick to a selected band She gave to execute the dire command; Reluctant to the charge, they yet obey, And to the shore the Mourning Fair convey. Slow as she moved, soft sorrows bathe the ground; Her guards too melt, and pitying weep around; Tho' vers'd in blood, detest the stern commands, And feel their hearts rebellious to their hands. When now upon the appointed beach they stood, That look'd with horror o'er the deepening flood, Each eyed his fellow with relenting look, And each to each the cruel task forsook; With distant awe the Heavenly Maid survey, Nor once her harm in act or thought essay. The still suspense at length their leader broke, And bow'd before the Trembling Beauty, spoke: “O thou, endow'd with more than mortal charms, “Who every foe of all his force disarms! “Say, how shall we our power or will employ; “Where both are weak, to spare thee, or destroy— “Both impotent alike our power and will, “The means to save thee, or the thoughts to kill? “Yet one extreme may cruelly remain, “To yield thee haply to the pitying main; “And Heaven, who form'd thee so divinely fair, “If Heav'n has power, will sure have will to spare.” He said; the rest assent, and to the bay With secret step the Virgin-Bride convey. Convenient here a Roman bark they find; They hoist the hasty canvas to the wind: The bark with Roman wealth and plenty stow'd, Now launching with the Lonely Sailor rode; The gale from shore with ready rapture blew, And to her vessel bore the last adieu. Now, stain'd with blood, the self-convicted night Fled from the face of all enquiring light; And morn, unconscious of the murderous scene, O'er Syria, guilty Syria, rose serene. The mountains sink before Constantia's eyes; Wing'd o'er the surge, her bounding galley flies; From sight of land, and human face conveys, The skies alone above, and all around the seas. “Go, Lovely Mariner! Imperial Fair! “The warring winds and angry ocean dare; “Strange climes and spheres, a lone adventurer, view, “New to the main, and to misfortune new; “Without the chart, or polar compass steer, “Nor storms, in which the stoutest tremble, fear. “But ill those limbs, for gentle office form'd, “And in the down of nightly softness warm'd, “Shall now, obsequious to the ruder gale, “Command the frozen cord, and ponderous sail; “Shall now, beneath the watery sky obscure, “The nightly damp and piercing blast endure.” Thus all disconsolate, and sore distrest, And sorrow heaving in her beauteous breast, Down sinks the Fair; her hands in anguish rise, And up to Heaven she lifts her streaming eyes: “O Thou!” she said, “whence every being rose, “In whom they safe exist, and soft repose; “Fix'd in whose power, and patent to whose eye, “Immense, those copious worlds of wonders lie; “To me, the meanest of thy works descend; “To me, the last of every being, bend! “Since not exempt, in thy paternal care, “The lowest triumph, and minutest share; “Thy subjects all, and all their sovereign know, “The seas that eddy, and the winds that blow; “The winds thy ruling inspiration tell; “The seas, exulting in thy presence, swell: “O'er these, o'er those, supreme, do Thou preside; “For I desire no other star to guide: “In want, and weakness, be thy power display'd, “And Thou assist, where else no arm can aid. “But if, as surely every mortal must, “If now I hasten to my native dust, “From the dread hour, and this devouring deep, “The Spark of Deathless Animation keep; “Then may my Soul, as bright instinctive flame, “Aspiring then, thy Kindred Radiance claim; “Or to some humbler Heaven the trembler raise, “Tho' there the last, the first to sing thy praise: “Some lowly, vacant seat, Eternal, deign, “Nor be Creation, and Redemption vain!” So pray'd the Maid, and Peace, a wonted guest, Sought the known mansion of her spotless breast; To every peril arm'd, and pain resigned, Cheer in her looks, and patience in her mind. The wind fresh blowing from the Syrian shore, Swift thro' the floods her spooming vessel bore. Long breathed the current of the eastern gale, And swell'd the expanse of each distended sail: And now the hills of Candia rise to view, As evening clouds and settled vapours blue; And now, still driven before the orient blast, Morea, and her lengthening capes are past: Now land again her wistful prospect flies, And gives the unvarying ocean to her eyes; Till Malta's rocks, emerging from the main, The circling war of earth and sea maintain. Alike unknown, each varying clime appear'd; The land and main alike the Virgin fear'd; While every coast her wandering eyes explore, Reminds her soul of Syria's hostile shore; And more than every monster seas can yield, From man, from man, she begs that Heaven would shield. Full many a day, and many a night, forlorn, Thro' shelves, and rocks, and eddying tempest born, Thro' drizzling sky, and nightly damp severe, No fire to warm, no social face to cheer; On many a meal of tainted viands fed, The chill blast whistling round her beauteous head; The pensive Innocence attends her fate, Amidst surrounding deaths, and storms, sedate. Ye silken sons of Affluence and Pride! Whose fortunes roll a soft superfluous tide, Who yet on visionary wants refine, And rack'd with false fantastic woes repine; And ye, whom Penury and sharp Distress, With bitter, but salubrious medicine, bless— Behold that sex, whose softness men despise; Behold a Maid, who might instruct the wise, Give patience precedent, fierce frenzy 'swage, And with philosophy new-form the sage! For her the tides of regal fullness flow'd; For her oppression heap'd the cumbrous load; In affluence humble, in misfortune great, She stands the worst alternatives of fate! At length, her galley wing'd before the blast, Swift launching, thro' the straits of Ceuta past; And winding now before the varying gale, Tempestuous Auster rends her labouring sail: Hispania's realm the obsequious vessel coasts; Now Gallia's surge the Beauteous Burthen boasts; Till last, Britannia's wave the Charge receives, And from the Atlantic main, exalting, heaves; The destined freight with pleased emotion bore, And gently wafted to Northumbria's shore. But haply now 'twere obvious to demand, How borne from Solyma's far-distant land, Thro' many a clime and strait that might restrain, The gust of winter, and the whelming main, Britannia's coast should fix the wandering Maid, Thro' such a length of devious tracts convey'd? “Say first, when ships in dizzy whirlwinds wheel, “Who points the fervour of the amorous steel? “Wing'd by whose breath the bidden tempests blow? “Heaved in whose fulness mighty oceans flow? “Yet what are winds that blow, or seas that roll? “The globe stupendous, or the poising pole? “What the seven planets on their axis spun? “What the wide system of our centering sun? “A point, an atom, to the ambient space, “Where worlds on worlds in circling myriads race! “Yet these the inanimate volution keep, “And roll eliptic thro' the boundless deep; “While One Hand weighs the infinite suspense, “The insensate loads and measures the immense; “Within, without, thro' height and depth presides; “With equal arm, the bark, or planet, guides. “By Thee uplifted, thro' the pathless skies, “With conscious plume, the birds of passage rise; “Thro' Thee their patent longitude is known, “The stated climate, and the varying zone. “Thy Will informs the universal plan, “The ways of Angels, and the ways of man; “The moral and material world connects, “Thro' each, Supreme, both governs and inspects; “Conducts the blood thro' each arterial round, “Conducts each system thro' the vast profound: “One Rule, the joint, the boundless model forms, “And the small ant to love of order warms; “Alike, thro' high, and low, and great, and small, “Nor aught's mysterious, or mysterious all.” What time the wafting tide, and favouring blast, The Fair on Britain's fated region cast; Young Alla then Northumbria's sons obey'd, Whose substituted scepter Offa sway'd: Illustrious Offa, who in worth excell'd Whate'er the rolls of Saxon heroes held! Alone Rodolphus, to the chief allied, Excell'd in arms, but much excell'd in pride. High on the brow of a commanding steep, And full in prospect of the eastern deep, His seat, addrest for war, as for repose, And fix'd with elegance, brave Offa chose. And now the hero, at his wonted hour, Where trees o'er-arching form'd the Sylvan bower, With Hermigilda sought the evening-air, His bride, the fairest of the Saxon fair— When from the main, and obvious to the view, The apparent wreck their fix'd attention drew; And quickly by innate compassion led, Attended, to the neighbouring shore they sped. Constantia here sole mariner they found, Admiring gaze, and silently surround: Her eyes to Heaven the Grateful Charmer rais'd, And with mute thanks of swift acceptance prais'd; Then turn'd, with suppliant mien her arms extends, And lowly at their feet for mercy bends. Tho' Pagans, yet with native virtues blest, The sentiment humane inform'd their breast: They her sad narrative of woes enquire, Prompt to redress, as courteous to desire. With moving eloquence the Maid began, And thro' a length of strange disasters ran: What truth required, with artless grace reveal'd; What prudence check'd, with graceful art conceal'd; Pathetic gave her sufferings to the view, But o'er her state a specious covering threw. Sweet flow'd the accents of her gentle tongue; Attention on the mournful music hung: Each heart a sympathetic anguish felt— Who saw that face, and could refuse to melt? Great Offa's bride with answering woes distrest, With streaming eyes and clasping arms carest: Officious now to please, and prompt to aid, They to the palace lead the Peerless Maid; With feast, and song, and social aspect cheer, And, as of more than mortal mould, revere. Here, pleased with privacy, and long content, Her days the Universal Charmer spent; To office apt, and each obliging art, She kindly stole the voluntary heart; Adored around, a mental empire gain'd, And still a Queen thro' every bosom reign'd. What winning power on beauty's charm attends! The rude it softens, and the bigot bends. What precept from Constantia's lips can fail? What truth so musical, and not prevail? Persuasive while she pleads, the priest might learn, The deaf find ears, and even the blind discern. Soon thro' the house of generous Offa spread, Her pleasing tongue its sacred influence shed; And all the cordial proselytes of grace, The Christian Law, the Law of Love, embrace. But ah, sweet Maid, how short is thy repose! Nor hope that here thy scenes of suffering close; Heaven speeds the planet that o'er-ruled thy birth, And hastes to make one Angel, even on earth. Rodolphus to the Saxon chief allied, Whose strength of limb with mightiest giants vied, Of feature crude, and insolent of soul, Whose heart nor knew, or mercy, or controul— He saw; and though to deeds of discord bred, He saw, and on the lovely vision fed: Swift through his veins the sulphurous poison run, But women seem'd all obvious to be won. Malicious fervour prompts him to enjoy; Dire is the love that's eager to destroy! Vows, prayers, and oaths, and menaces he tried, And prized alike the prostitute, and bride. But when repuls'd with merited disdain, He found all threats, as all intreaties vain, The flame that gloomy in his bosom burn'd, To deadly hate by swift transition turn'd; And nightly, in his dark designing soul, Dire future scenes and schemes infernal roll. Mean-time, the sons of hostile Scotia arm, And fame through Albion gives the loud alarm. Young Alla at the warlike call arose, And speeds with answering boldness to oppose; While Offa, with glad heart, and honours due, To welcome his approaching sovereign flew. And now Rodolphus, of whose baleful breast The fiends and every fury stood possest, On ills of cruellest conception bent, To perpetrate his deadly purpose meant. All wrapt in clouds, from Heaven's nocturnal steep Mid darkness hung, and weigh'd the world to sleep; When Offa's consort, and the Roman Maid, By unsuspecting innocence betray'd, Divinely pious, and divinely fair, Tired with long vigil and the nightly prayer, Together lock'd in calm oblivion lay; Not both to rise and greet returning day. Rodolphus, unperceived, invades the room, His bosom darker than the midnight gloom: Dire o'er the gentle pair the felon stands, A ponyard thirsting in his impious hands. As should some cottager, with hourly care, Two lambs, his sole delight and substance, rear, With fondness at his rural table fed, Beneath his eye, and in his bosom bred; Till fierce for blood, and watchful to devour, Some prowling wolf perceives the absent hour, His nightly tread through some sly postern bends, And the meek pair with savage fury rends— So sweet, so innocent, the Fair Ones lay; So stern, the human savage views his prey! His steel swift plunged through Hermigilda's breast, From the pure form, dismiss'd the purer guest; Without one sigh her gentle soul expires, And waked in bliss, the wondrous change admires, Beyond beyond what utterance e'er can name, Or vision of ecstatic fancy frame. Not so, bright Maid! thy harder fate intends; A simple death was only meant for friends: For thee, he hoards the fund of future ill, And spares with tenfold cruelty to kill. Close by Constantia, lovely sleeping maid, His reeking steel the murderous ruffian laid: Revolved within his breast new mischiefs brew, And smiling horridly the fiend withdrew. Thick darkness yet withstood approaching day, And camp'd upon the western summits lay; And scarce the straggling rays of orient light, Excursive, pierced the paler realms of night; Their passage through Constantia's casement won, And viewed the brightest form beneath the sun— When the first glories of her opening eyes With prompt, with early elevation rise, Its wing tow'rds Heaven her waking soul extends, And in a rhapsody of praise ascends. But ah, not long those lively transports burn! Confused, alarm'd, her thoughts to earth return: All chill, and in the vital current drown'd, Pale at her side, her lovely friend she found; A cloud of horror quick involved the Fair, And uttering shrieks exprest the loud despair. Waked to her griefs, the scared domestics rose: In rush'd the train, shrill echoing to her woes; O'er the pale dame a mourning torrent shed, And with repeated cries invoke the dead. Rodolphus too, with well-dissembled fears, And face of busy feign'd concern, appears: From Heaven's high wrath, with swift perdition sped, He calls down vengeance on the guilty head; Apparent zeal his earnest visage fires, And loud the murderer for himself enquires. With bloody marks of dire conjecture stain'd, Constantia, hapless virgin, stands arraign'd: The Fair with fears her guiltless cause essays; But ah! each specious circumstance betrays: Rude cords around her polish'd arms they strain; Strong pleads the Innocent, but pleads in vain. Far were thy friends, Constantia, lovely maid! Far distant all, that had the power to aid; From guilt, from death, from infamy to save, Or shed a tear upon a stranger's grave. And now the tale, with deadly tidings fraught, To Offa's ear a speedy courier brought. Heart pierc'd with anguish stood the mourning chief; No plaints express'd the inutterable grief; No sighs exhale, no streaming sorrows flow, Fix'd and immoveable in speechless woe. Compassion touch'd the generous Alla's breast, For his brave subject, for his friend distrest; Each circumstance the Royal Youth enquires, And the dire act his just resentment fires. By specious proofs of false suggestion led, He vows full vengeance on Constantia's head; To doom the luckless Innocent he speeds, And in his wrath the previous victim bleeds. Fame flies before with voluntary wing; A thousand distant shouts proclaim their King: Pour'd from all parts, the populace unite, And on his form insatiate feed their sight; For Alla, bright in each perfection, shone, That graced the cottage, or enrich'd the throne: The nerve Herculean braced his youthful arm, His cheek imbibed the virgin's softest charm: Mild was his soul, all spotless as his form; His virtues not severe, but chaste and warm; His manners sweet and sprightly, yet sincere; His judgment calm and deep, yet quick and clear: Graceful his speech, above the flowers of art; Open his hand, more bounteous yet his heart; As Mercy soft, kind, social, and humane, Vice felt alone, that Alla held the rein: To all the pride of courts, and pomp of show, The brightest ornament, yet greatest foe! Within, without, thus rich in every grace, And all the Angel in his soul and face, Not form'd to feel Love's passion, but impart, No charms were yet found equal to his heart: For him each virgin sighed, but sighed in vain, By him unpitied, since unknown the pain. Detesting flattery, yet fond of fame, Thro' deadly fields he sought a deathless name; Still foremost there, he sprung with youthful heat, And War, not Love, gave Alla's breast to beat; Each foe he conquer'd, and each friend retain'd, And scepter'd in his subjects bosoms reign'd. And now arrived—severe in solemn state, Whence no appeal, the grand tribunal sate. Great Alla, throned conspicuous to the view, Attention, love, and centering reverence drew. In form, the deadly process strait began; Wide thro' the croud, a doubtful murmur ran; Rodolphus chief the Friendless Prisoner charged, Enforced the pain, and on the guilt enlarged. The Fair Unknown to her defence they cite: Guarded she comes, as pure, as angels bright; As tho' delight and grief at once combined, And fled to her, displeased with all mankind; Or as delight would grief, in grief, excell, Or grief could find delight with her to dwell. Pensive she moves, majestically slow, And with a pomp of beauty decks her woe: All murmurs, silenced by her presence, cease, And from her eye the yielding croud gives place; Even Alla's looks his softening soul confest, And all resentment died within his breast. But ah! while shame with injured honour vies, While yet her tongue its faultering task denies, More than all phrase, or studied quaint address, Her down-cast eyes and speaking looks express. At length pathetic, with a starting tear, She thus to bow'd attention charm'd the ear. “Where may the wretched for protection bend? “Or when, ah when, shall my misfortunes end? “Sure, persecution in the grave will cease; “And death bestow, what life denies me, peace. “Driven from before the face of humankind, “Earth, air, and sea, with cruel man combined; “Each hour, each element, prepared a foe, “And nature seem'd exhausted in my woe. “At length, with every grace and virtue crown'd, “One friend, one pitying faithful friend I found; “With her, retired, to pass my days I chose, “And here presumed to taste a late repose: “But peace to me, alike all climes refuse, “And mischief to the farthest pole pursues; “'Tis even a crime to be Constantia's friend, “Nor less than death to those who would defend. “Ah Hermigilda! could my forfeit life, “To the fond husband give the faithful wife; “From death recall thy chastely featured charms, “And yield thee to the generous Offa's arms; “Ah! gladly would I then resign my breath, “If life so dear could be revived by death. “But thus to die with foul suspicion stain'd, “For murder, murder of my friend arraign'd!— “Alas! unskill'd in every cruel art, “Had I the power to hurt, I want the heart: “No creature e'er Constantia's malice felt; “Ev'n suffering foes have taught my heart to melt, “My heart, for birds, for insects oft distrest; “And Pity is its known, its only guest. “O Youth! thy happy people's boasted theme, “O Alla! sacred to the breath of fame, “To whom subjected realms their rights submit, “Who throned in judgment like an Angel sit; “Still more extensive be thy guardian care, “And let the Innocent, the Stranger share!” Here rudely on her plea Rodolphus broke, And all inflamed, and interrupting, spoke: “List not, O King, to that bewitching tongue! “So sweetly false the tempting Syrens sung; “Her words would give the knotted oak an ear, “And charm the moon from her enchanted sphere. “That by her hand our dear relation bled, “This sword shall witness on her guilty head, “Whatever champion, or bold odds oppose, “And, arm'd by justice, dare a thousand foes: “Then be her purity by combat tried; “And by the conquering arm let Heaven decide. “Alas, O Alla!” cried the trembling Maid, “My sex, not arms but Innocence must aid. “Helpless I stand, and distant every friend, “That has the power, or courage to defend. “If justice is ordain'd to crown the strong, “Then the weak arm is ever in the wrong; “The hawk may triumph in his lawless deeds, “While doom'd beneath his gripe the turtle bleeds. “Yet that I'm guiltless, even my charge admits, “And malice, meaning to arraign, acquits: “What tho' the sword lay treacherous at my side? “Sure, guilt could never want the craft to hide! “The spots of bloody circumstance explain, “That inward truth fears no exterior stain; “And last my capture with the slain implies, “That guilt, not Innocence, from vengeance flies. “I fear not death, but that surviving shame, “Which must to ages blast my spotless name— “Be that from taint of guilty censure freed, “And all that malice can inflict, decreed!” Thus while she spake, with secret passion tost, And in a world of new found wonders lost, Scarce Alla could his struggling heart controul: Fix'd were his eyes, but restless was his soul; His breast with various agitation burn'd; Now pale, now red, his varying aspect turn'd: Her accents dwell upon his listening ears; When now she ceased, delighted still he hears; Her form with changed with feverish look surveys, And could for ever hear, for ever gaze. At length collected, as from bonds he broke, And with cold speech, and feign'd indifference, spoke: “Thy charge, bright Maid! my secret soul acquits; “But public law no private voice admits: “Kings sit not here, with arbitrary sense “To form new laws, or cavil, but dispense; “Though law is fallible, yet law should sway, “And kings, more fallible than law, obey. “Say, gallant warriors! who, unmatch'd in arms, “May yield uncensured to resistless charms; “Say, is there one, who, singularly brave, “At his own peril greatly dares to save; “From pain, from death, from slander, to defend, “And give the Stranger, and the Fair, a friend?” The Hero said; but mute was every tongue, Blank every face, and every nerve unstrung; So much Rodolphus, never match'd in arms, Each weaker hand and conscious heart alarms; So was the giant famed for brutal power, Strode like an arch, and menaced like a tower! Then Alla—“Soon as Phosphor's dewy ray “Shall gild the shade, bright promiser of day, “Prepared and meted with the morning light, “Be the rail'd barrier, and the lists of fight: “Then, e'er the sun, swift mounting up the sky, “Views the wide world with his meridian eye, “While issuing from the trumpet's brazen throat “Defiance loudly breathes its martial note, “If haply Heaven, not impotent to aid, “With interposing arm protect the Maid, “Some angel, or unlook'd for champion send, “And with prevailing ministry defend; “Freed be the Fair, and spotless be her fame— “E'er evening else, she feeds the hungry flame!” So spake the Prince, descending from his throne: Sad through the concourse went the lengthening groan; The Maid, to death inevitably doom'd, A guiltless victim every heart presumed; To her they consecrate the pitying tear, Nor e'er, till then, could think their Prince severe. Constantia (when with firm tho' hopeless eye She now perceived the fatal hour drew nigh) In conscious innocence erects her head: With doubt exiled, all care and terror fled; Death stole from triumph to adorn her state, And gave a smile beyond the reach of fate. All night, in prayer and mental song, the Maid, With Angels choir'd, her soul for Heaven array'd: Light from her heart, as summer's careless robe, Dropt each affection of this sin-worn globe; O'er honour, late so loved, o'er brutal foes, And every sense of mortal coil she rose; Till tow'rd the dawn she gently sunk to rest, With all Elysium open'd in her breast. Gray morning now involved in rising dew, O'er the capt hills her streaming mantle threw; While, far beyond, the horizontal sun With beam of intersected brightness shone; Gold paved o'er ocean stretch'd his glittering road, And to the shore the lengthening radiance glowed. Full in his sight, and open to the main, Concurring squadrons throng'd Northumbria's plain: To learn what fate attends the foreign Fair, Each sex and age in mingling routs repair, Whom, pour'd by millions to the listed field, Dispeopled towns, and emptied hamlets yield. Within the lists, conspicuous to the sight, Rode the proud stature of the Saxon knight: His mien, with thirst of opposition fired, Appeared to menace what it most desired; Gave all to wish some champion for the Fair, Gave all to wish the fight, but none to dare. His bold defiance o'er the measured ground, The brazen blasts of winding clarions sound; While strong lung'd heralds challenge to the fight, And seem, at once, to threaten, and invite. And now, expectant of the murderous flame, In sable pomp the Lovely Victim came: On her, all looks, and centering hearts were fix'd, Love, grief, and awe, with soft compassion mix'd; To Heaven, the voice of wide affliction cries; Earth drinks the tribute of ten thousand eyes— Such sighs, as from the dying breast expire, And tears, as meant to quench a world on fire. To the tall pyre, in sad procession led, The Tranquil Maid ascends her sylvan bed; And fearless on the funeral summit placed, Her seat of fearful preparation graced. Hence, with wide gaze, she threw her eyes around, Nor Alla, cruel, lovely Alla, found. “Ah,” soft she said, “where's this heroic youth, “So famed for clemency, so famed for truth; “So sage, so cautious in the casuist's chair, “Too firm to deviate, and too just to spare; “To strangers cruel, tho' to subjects kind; “In law discerning, yet to mercy blind? “Why comes not he to feast his savage eyes, “And view the pains he can so well devise? “Heaven framed thee, Alla, with exterior art, “Soften'd thy form, but left a flinty heart; “Too perfect else had been the beauteous plan, “And Alla had been something more than man!” Thus while she spoke, a distant murmur rose, As when the wind thro' rustling forest blows; And gathering now still louder and more near, To mute attention turn'd each listening ear. Distinctly heard along the listed ground, To trumpets, now, shrill answering trumpets sound; A clamorous cheer from rank to rank extends, And sudden shout the deafen'd welkin rends. Straight, usher'd to the field with loud acclaim, A knight unknown, and unattended came: No trophied boast, no outward shine of arms, Nor love device, with quaint attraction charms; Unplumed the motion of his sable crest, And black the guardian corselet on his breast; Black was the steed that bore him to the field, And black the terror of his ample shield. As when, to slake Ierne's feverish plain, And check the Dog-star's short but sultry reign, A cloud, full-freighted with the coming storm, Black-brow'd o'er ocean lifts its cumberous form, Dread, to the shore its gloomy progress bends, And charged with Heaven's avenging bolt suspends— So to the field the gloomy champion show'd; So charged with mercy, as with vengeance rode. Where the Bright Victim blest the circling view, Close to the pyre the sable warrior drew: “Guilty,” aloud, “or innocent?” he cried— “Ah guiltless—so help Heaven!” the Maid replied; “So by this arm,” he said, “may Heaven for thee decide!” Surprised Rodolphus stood; abash'd the bold, And like a torrent in mid course controll'd; Abash'd to find, that any mortal wight Could singly dare to match his matchless might. But soon, of conscious force, and scorn, and pride, With two-fold fury swelled the impetuous tide: Resistless, dreadful, in his wrath he rose; For courage still with opposition grows. Attending heralds straight divide the field, And the dire interval for combat yield. To either goal retired each threatful knight, Fierce thro' restraint, and trembling for the fight, On each by turns was every look intent, Now here, now there, with swift emotion bent: Perch'd on the summit of the Stranger's crest, Here conquest seem'd to every eye confest; Not long confest, for from his rival, there, Again the varying judgment learns despair; For every wish assumed the Stranger's part, And quick expectance throbb'd in every heart. Fix'd in his seat, each waits the dread career, And in each rest firm sits the ponderous spear; Each conscious steed impatient beats the ground; Eager and wan was every face around. The signal given, they vanish from the goals; Earth backward spurn'd from either courser rolls; Space gathers quick beneath their nimble feet, And horse to horse, tremendous shock! they meet. Not yet blind wrath, or head-long valour ruled; More forceful was their force, by judgment cool'd: The deadly aim each hostile eye selects, Each eye too marks where either arm directs; With art they ward, and with dread action wield, Point with the lance, and parry with the shield. Full at the bosom of his active foe, Rodolphus levell'd the resistless blow; But from his oblique buckler glanced the spear, Which else, nor targe, nor mortal arm could bear. Not so his lance the Sable Champion sped, Feign'd at the breast, then brandish'd at the head; Thro' his foe's shield the verging weapon prest, And razed the plume that wanton'd on his crest. Together, with impetuous onset push'd, Thus horse to horse, and man to man, they rush'd; Then backward, driven by mutual shock, they bound: Beneath the conflict shakes the suffering ground. So wing'd, in war, or darkness, on the deep, Two ships adverse the mediate ocean sweep: With horrid brunt joins each encountering prow; Loud roars the rifled surge, and foams below; Sails, shrowds, and masts, all shiver in the toil, And backward to their sterns the foundering keels recoil. But each well skill'd in every warlike meed, New to the charge revives his sinking steed; Swift from his side his steely terror drew, And on his foe with answering fury flew. The sway long time intemperate valour bore, While artless rage unlearn'd the warrior's lore: On their hack'd arms the restless peal descends, Targe, plate, and mail, and riven corselet, rends; Struck from their helms, the steely sparks aspire, And from their swords forth streams the mingling fire. As in the glow of some Vulcanian shed, Two brawny smiths heave high the ponderous sled, Full front to front, a grizzly pair, they stand; Between their arms extends the fiery brand; Huge strokes from the tormented anvil bound; Thick flames the air, and groans the labouring ground— So toil'd these heroes with commutual rage, And such reciprocated combat wage. Around them, trembling Expectation waits; With speechless horror every bosom beats; For either seem'd resistless in the fight, But each too seem'd to match resistless might. Surprized at length the wary warriors own A rival to their arms till then unknown; With mutual wile defensive now they fought, And mutual wounds a mutual caution taught: All dint of force, and stratagem, they try, Reach with their arms, and measure with their eye; They feint, they ward, strike out, and now evade, Foin with the point, and parry with the blade; Probe each defect, some purposed limb expose, Now grappling seize, and with dread union close; Their waists with unenamour'd grasp they wind; Their arms, like cramps, and forceful engines, bind; Each strives to lift the other from his seat, Heaved thick, and short, their labouring bosoms beat; Struggling they gripe, they pull, they bend, they strain, But firm and still unsway'd their seats retain; Till loosed as by consent again they turn, And with reviving force and fury burn. Thus future ages had this fight beheld, Where both all might excelling, none excell'd, Had not Rodolphus with impassion'd pride, High heaved a blow that should at once decide, His utmost powers collected in the stroke— Like thunder o'er the yielding foe he broke: The foe elusive of the dire intent, His force in air the embarrass'd Pagan spent, And by his bulk of cumberous poise o'ersway'd, Full on his helm received the adverse blade: Prone fell the Giant o'er a length of ground; With ceaseless shouts the echoing heavens resound. As from the brow of some impending steep, The sportive diver views the briny deep, From his high stand with headlong action flies, And turns his heels retorted to the skies; Inverted so the bulky Chief o'erturns, And heaven, with heel of quick elation, spurns. Light from his steed the conquering Hero sprung, And threatful o'er the prostrate monster hung: He, with feign'd penitence, and humbled breath, Fond to evade the fear'd, the impending death, (The instant weapon glittering at his breast) The murderous scene and nightly guilt confest. Mean-while, attended by the shouting crew, The Fair, now freed, to greet her Champion flew; For not of mortal arm the Chief she thought, But Heaven's own delegate with vengeance fraught. When now, enchanting to the Warrior's sight, The Maid drew near, the Maid as Angels bright, His beaver from his lovely face he rais'd, And all on Alla, conquering Alla, gazed: Earth, sea, and air, with endless triumph ring, And shouting thousands hail their Victor King. Not so Constantia,—struck with strange surprize, Her great deliverer in her judge she eyes; Conquest and love upon his regal brow, A cruel judge, but kind deliverer now: Soft shame, and trembling awe, her step represt, And wondrous gratitude disturb'd her breast; Joys, fainting fears, quick thrill'd through every vein, And scarce her limbs their beauteous charge sustain. How widely devious from the ways of man, Is the great maze of Providential plan! Vain man, short-sighted politician! dreams, That things shall move subservient to his schemes; But Heaven the fond projector undermines, And makes the agent thwart his own designs; Against it self the instrument employs, And with the means the end proposed destroys. What shall prevent Omniscience to direct? And what, what can't Omnipotence effect? He to the event subdues the opposing cause, And light from darkness, wondrous influence, draws; Defeat from conquest, infamy from fame; And oft to honour paves the path of shame. Why then this toil, and coil, and anxious care? Why does man triumph, why does man despair? Why does he chuse by vicious steps to scale, Where Virtue may, at least as well, prevail? Since not in him his proper fortune lies, And Heaven alone ordains his fall or rise: Man may propose, but only Heaven must speed; And tho' the will is free, the event's decreed. Be then the scope of every act, and thought, To will, and do, still simply as we ought; The less shall Disappointment's sting annoy, And each success will bring a double joy: To boundless Power and Prescience leave the rest; But thou enjoy the province in thy breast! Lo! in one hour, by fortune unforeseen, The lowly Criminal becomes the Queen; From shame to glory, anguish to repose, From death to life, and bonds to freedom rose. In love, as war, resistless, Alla woo'd, And whom he won by arms, by suit subdued: Constantia with her secret wish complied, For Alla would not, could not be denied. Nor list we here, with pomp of long array, To blazon forth that chaste connubial day; To tell what numbers numberless, what knights And glittering dames adorn'd the festal rites; What joys the banquet or the bowl could yield, Or what the trophies of the tilting field. Loud were the revels, boundless was the mirth, That hail'd the sweetest brightest pair on earth— Of men, the wisest, bravest, fairest, He; Of all that's beautiful most beauteous, She! Love, nature, harmony, the union claim'd, And each for each, and both for one were framed. But we of subsequent adventure treat, And hasten to unfold their future fate. Some months young Alla and his peerless bride, In cordial bond of dear accordance tied, Had look'd and smiled the precious hours away, And fed on bliss that ne'er could know decay: He, whose charm'd ear on that enchanting tongue With thirst of fondest inclination hung, Won by a preacher with so fair a face, Becomes the zealous proselyte of Grace; And subjects too their heathenish rites forego, For still from courts, or vice, or virtues flow. But ah! too soon, from beauty's softer charms, War, rigorous war, and Scotia call to arms; Constantia must her blooming Hero yield, For Honour sends him to the embattell'd field. Mean-while, the pregnant fruit of chaste delight With a male infant crown'd the nuptial rite; All sweet and lovely as the smiling morn, Mauritius was to bless a nation born: Their pledge of future bliss, their princely boy, The Britons hail with universal joy; Their fancy frames him what their prayers require, Sweet as their Queen, and valiant as his Sire. Offa, to whom the King's departing care, Inestimable charge! consigned the Fair, Advice of loyal gratulation sent, To glad his Sovereign with the blest event. But Donnegilda, cruel, crafty dame, Great Alla's mother, over-fond of fame, She, (as all antique parents, wondrous sage, For youth project the inappetence of age, Each sense endearing and humane despise, And on the Mammon feast their down-cast eyes) Malevolent beheld a Stranger led, Unknown, unfriended, to the Regal Bed: For in the secret closet of her breast, Constantia her imperial birth supprest, Till Heaven should perfect the connubial band, And with her Royal Offspring bless the land. “Ah! ill-timed caution! were this truth declared, “What a vast cost of future woe was spared! “But where Heaven's will the unequal cause supplies, “To set the world on fire a spark may well suffice.” The subtile dame, who now the occasion spied To tear Constantia from her Alla's side, Debauch'd the messenger, his mandate stole, And forged in Offa's name the crafty scroll; Wherein she framed a tale with wondrous art, “How the feign'd Fair by witchcraft won his heart, “Seduced his senses with infernal lore, “And a dread monster, hideous offspring! bore.” But Alla, of whose fond, whose faithful breast, His Consort was the dear eternal guest, Unmoved, return'd—“His bliss was too refined, “Without the just allay that Heaven assigned; “And what Constantia bore, or Heaven decreed, “To be unwelcome, must be strange indeed!” This letter too the courier, as before, To Britain's Dowager unweeting bore; And in the surfeit of oblivious wine Left her to perpetrate the black design. This too she cancell'd, forged the Regal Hand, And pityless inscribed “the dire command, “With threats, that Offa, to the wonted sea, “Should the false Queen and hated Imp convey; “And there permit the now detested Dame “To seek the shore from whence the sorceress came.” When Offa had the barbarous mandate read, To Heaven his eyes and lifted hands he spread. Like Niobe to marble turn'd, he stood; Grief, fear, and horror, froze the generous blood: Again he stirr'd, as from some wistful dream; Again he read—alas! he read the same. But, tho' in terms of soothing phrase exprest, When now Constantia learn'd her Lord's behest, Keen anguish, piercing to the springs of life, At once arrests the Mother and the Wife: For not, to her alone confined, as late When bold she stood the weightiest stroke of fate, A thousand cares of soft endearing kind, Now share with Heaven the motions of her mind; And with fond thoughts of sweet concern divide, The melting Mother, and the clasping Bride: And these alone her bursting bosom rend, And o'er the couch her lifeless limbs extend. Fame pour'd the mourning populace around: In gushing anguish every eye is drown'd; Compassion set her virtues full to view, And with their Queen bade every joy adieu; Swift from his throne they wish their Alla hurl'd, And her crown'd empress of the peopled world: But ah! in vain their prayers and tears delay; Strict was the charge, and Offa must obey. With heavy heart and faint reluctant hand, He led the Mourner to the neighbouring strand: She to the heaving whiteness of her breast, With melting looks, her helpless Infant prest; And thus, while sobs her piteous accent broke, Her little inattentive child bespoke. “Weep not, sweet Wretch! Tho' such thy father's will, “Yet hast thou one, one tender parent still. “Peace, peace! to thee thy Mother means no harm; “Nor let our lot thy little heart alarm: “O'er thee, till death, o'er thee my cares shall wake, “And love thee for thy cruel Father's sake.” Had every sire as on the banks of Nile, Lost his first-born throughout Britannia's isle; Or death with undistinguish'd carnage swept Wives, sons, and sires, by all the living wept; Such haply were the woes that now deplore Their Queen attended to the echoing shore: They tear their locks, their rueful bosoms smite, And trace her bark with long pursuing sight. Tedious it were, tho' wondrous strange to tell, What new adventures o'er the main befel; How fondly prattling, while her Infant smiled, She the long hours and wintery nights beguiled; Till seiz'd by pirates on the Atlantic wave, A prince of Gallia bought the Imperial Slave: How, in calm peace and friendship long retain'd, High trust and grace her winning sweetness gain'd; Till she to Rome, predestinate event! Associate with her lord and mistress went. But now to Britain let the Muse repair; For there the valiant Alla claims her care. Triumphant soon from Scotia he return'd, And to behold his loved Constantia burn'd: This wings his feet along the toilsome way— But thoughts are swifter, swifter far than they; Hope, elevate, the distant journey metes, And to his march his heart the measure beats. But when o'er Tweed he led his conquering host, And trode the verdure of Northumbria's coast, While laurels round their trophied temples twined, And banners wanton'd in the curling wind, No wonted crowds their once-loved Alla meet, No prostrate knees, or hailing voices greet: Blank was his passage o'er the pensive ground, And silence cast a mournful gloom around; Or if his Prince some straggling peasant spied, As from a basilisk he slunk aside. What this might mean, revolved within his breast, Conjecture dire, and whispering doubts suggest; More dread than death, some hideous ill impart— This the first fear e'er seized on Alla's heart. But worse, O worse than fancy yet could fear, When now the killing truth arrests his ear! Athwart his eyes, and mantling round his soul, Thick clouds of grief and dreary darkness roll; His sense, nor tears nor uttering groans could tell, But froze and lock'd in speechless woe he fell. At length by care, by cruel kindness, brought To all the anguish of returning thought, Swift from the sheath he drew the deadly guest, And would have pierc'd this vulture in his breast; Such was the sting of agonizing pain, His frenzy would the immortal soul have slain! But this prevented, round the attending crew, With baleful glance, his eager eyes he threw: “Constantia!” he requires with frantic tongue “Constantia!” still the restless accents sung: To her, as present, now his fondness speaks; As absent, into desperate action breaks. “O never, never more, my Queen!” he cries, “Shall that known form attract these dying eyes! “Never?—O, 'tis the worst, the last despair— “Never is long, is wondrous long to bear! “Down, down, ye cloud-topt hills, your summits stoop; “With me, in sign of endless mourning, droop! “Snapt be the spear, bright armour ground to dust; “Repose thou corslet in eternal rust; “Still'd be each tube, the trumpet's warlike swell— “Empire, and fame, all, all, with Thee, farewell! “For Thee alone, thy conquering soldier arm'd, “The banner waved, and sprightly clangor charm'd: “But arms and loathed desire with Thee are dead; “And joy—no, never to return—is fled!” Thus raved the youth, to wilful woes resigned; And offer'd aid was sickness to his mind. To frenzy by uxorious transports rais'd, His vengeance on his aged parent seiz'd; Who, doom'd to lose that too designing head, A victim to his loved Constantia bled. But violence in nature cannot last: What region's known to bear eternal blast? Time changes all, dissolves the melting rock, And on fix'd water turns the chrystal lock. Time o'er his anguish shed a silent balm, A peace unsmiling, and a gloomy calm; By ill untaught to mourn, by joy to glow, And still insensible to bliss or woe. To him, thus careless of the circling year, Five annual suns had roll'd their bright career: To Heaven alone, his earthly ardours turn'd; There, late to meet the dear Constantia, burn'd: Still that fond hope remain'd—his sole desire! And gave new wings to the celestial fire. “But yet—Hereafter!—What might there betide “The blood-stain'd hand, by whom a parent died? This, this gave doubtful thought, unhinged his rest, And shook the region of his contrite breast; At length taught satiate vengeance to relent, And shipt for Rome, the Royal Pilgrim sent. O'er Tiber soon the far-fraught tidings sped, (For far beyond the Warrior's fame had spread) And Gallia's Hugo, to whose generous care, Protecting Heaven consigned the wandering Fair, With those whom virtuous approbation fired, (As still the Brave are by the Brave admired) To see to touch the gallant Alla glowed, And rank'd to meet the Regal Pilgrim rode. With all due rite and answering grace humane, The courteous Prince received the shining train: But Hugo chief, with port of winning view, The Hero's eye and prime affection drew; And him, with note selected from the rest, The Prince solicits for a frequent guest. But ah! when now it reach'd Constantia's ear, That Alla, lovely, barbarous man, was near, Her soul a thousand different thoughts assail; Expell'd by turns, by turns they all prevail: With melting joy and burning love she glows, With cooling grief and icy hate she froze; Dear to her heart, though horrid to her will, He was the loved the charming Alla still. Nor Hugo now, in pompous dress array'd, To wait Britannia's potent Lord delay'd. With him Mauritius frequent chat supplied, A little gay companion at his side— He beams a Ganymede, in whose sweet face The Sire and Mother lived with mingling grace: Here still they met, in beauty reconciled; Here still, in soft delicious union, smiled; So join'd, so blended, with Divinest art, As left it not in any power to part! Upon the Pratler's aspect, with surprize, And charm'd attention, Alla fix'd his eyes: Somewhat of wonted semblance there he spied, Dear to his sense, and to his heart allied; Somewhat that touch'd beyond all mortal view, And inly with the link of nature drew. Disturb'd he rose; upon his secret soul, Unweeting thaw, and cordial earnings stole: Big with the soft distress, aside he stept, And much the Warrior wonder'd why he wept. Composed, he clasp'd the infant to his breast, And ask'd, what sire with such a son was blest? “That,” Hugo cried, “his Dame alone must show; “Sire hath he none, or none of whom we know. “But Mother, sure, he hath, that's such a mate “No man can boast, nor boastful tongue relate: “Though Fancy, to give semblance of her face, “From all her sex should cull each separate grace, “To speak her soul should rob from every saint; “Low yet were phrase, and all description faint!” Thus, while his tongue with free encomium flowed, With strange emotion Alla's aspect glowed: Full on his heart the dear idea rush'd; His cheek with hope, and lively ardour flush'd; When straight despondence sickening in his soul, From its known seat the rosy tincture stole: “Once, once,” he cried (the labouring sigh supprest) “Such treasure once these widow'd arms possest! “Nature is rich—yet gladly should I know, “If the world's round can such another shew.” “Be that,” replied the Gallic chief, “confest, “Whene'er my house boasts Alla for a guest.” They went. But when the long-dissever'd pair, Her Alla here, and his Constantia there— By doubts, loves, fears, and rushing joys dismay'd, Unmoved, each face with mutual gaze survey'd— Such was the scene, the impassion'd gesture such, As phrase can't reach, nor liveliest pencil touch! Three times the Fair One sought the shades of death, Three times revived by Alla's balmy breath; And thrice his guiltless plea he would essay, And thrice she turn'd, Constantia turn'd away. “Now, by this hand,” Britannia's Hero cried, “This hand, by whom a cruel parent died, “Long since for thee, for thee thou dear one, bled, “A victim sacred to that injured head— “Of all thy wrongs thy Alla is as clear, “As here my son, thy other Alla here! “Ah! could you know the anguish, the distress— “But who can know what words can ne'er express?— “What racks, what deaths, thy torturing absence cost; “What restless toil this suffering bosom tost— “'Twas such a ruin, such a breach of care, “As this and only this could e'er repair!” So saying, swift resistless to his breast, The yielding Fair repeated transport prest. But when all doubt and cold suspicion clear'd, Her Lord still faithful as beloved appear'd; By her so oft, so cruelly accused, Still kind and true, and as her self abused; She in his bosom, all with joy o'erpower'd, Of sobs and tears the copious tempest shower'd— All eyes around the melting measure kept, And pleasure through contagious transport wept: For Heaven, alone, can emulate the sweet Of one hour's bliss, when two such lovers meet. Still had Constantia, lock'd within her breast, The Royal Secret of her Birth supprest, When Rome's Imperial Monarch wide invites To social cheer and festival delights: For now triumphant from the Syrian coast, Tho' long detain'd, return'd his vengeful host; And to reward their toils and drown their cares, The monarch on a solemn day prepares. With festal robes adorn'd each warrior came; In glittering vesture many a Roman dame: And there, amid the peers, a peerless guest, There Alla came in regal splendors drest, All India beaming at the Hero's side; O'er beaming India shone his brighter Bride; While the young joy of each applauding tongue, Mauritius on his smiling parents hung, As tho' a stripling Cherub should attend, Where two of prime Angelick Rank descend. Struck at the pleasing prospect all admire, But mute with wonder stood the Imperial Sire; For haply, since our primal parents fell, Ne'er met a pair that could this pair excel. He at his left Britannia's Monarch placed, And his right hand the unknown Constantia graced; When with a starting tear the Reverend Man, To Alla turn'd, in placid speech began: “Young tho' thou art, with earliest vigour strung, “And the fond theme of Fame's applauding tongue, “'Tis said thou hast the stings of fortune felt; “And such can learn from others woes to melt. “I had a Daughter—once my only care!— “As virtuous as thy Consort, and as fair: “But her (sad cause of folly to repent) “To Syria with a numerous train I sent; “And there the toil, the treacherous toil was spread, “And there Constantia, there, my child, you bled! “Around the Maid her brave attendants fell, “Nor one was left the fatal tale to tell: “Hence age through grief has doubly known decay, “And care untimely turn'd my locks to grey. “This day selected from the circling year, “To her I consecrate the annual tear; “And these the chiefs, who, in her quarrel crown'd, “Have late in vengeance bathed the hostile ground. “But vain is vengeance where all hope is fled; “Nor hosts of victims can revive the dead! “My child! thou'st robb'd my life of all delight— “But death shall soon our happier souls unite!” Nor yet he ended,—when, with troubled mein, Quick at his knees low bow'd Britannia's Queen: “Not so, not so, my Father!” loud she cried— “See here thy Child, thy daughter at thy side! “Why look you thus with wild and piercing eye? “Your Daughter here, your Daughter you descry! “Constantia, who through many a death survives, “And yet to see her King and Sire, arrives.” “Yes, yes, you are my child,—these accents tell!”— He could no more, but on her neck he fell. Down her soft cheek his mingling tears o'erflow; Joy, joy too great, assumed the form of woe! The roof, surprize and echoing transport tore; And eyes then wept, that never wept before. Wing'd as an arrow from some vigorous arm, Through Rome's wide city flew the glad alarm— “Constantia's here,—she lives!—she lives!”—they cried; “Constantia, now the British Hero's bride!” Around the palace pour'd in wild delight, On thousands gathering thousands straight unite: With ceaseless clamours and extended hands, Constantia's presence every voice demands; Constantia, Alla, and their Lovely Boy They claim, the blooming pledge of future joy! Forth straight they come conspicuous to the view, And greet with graceful mien the applauding crew: In shouts to Heaven their exultations fly, And universal joy torments the sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. FABLES THE TEMPLE of HYMEN. As on my couch supine I lay, Like others, dreaming life away; Methought, expanded to my sight, A temple rear'd its stately height. All ready built, without omitting One ornament, for temples fitting. Large look'd the pile, sublime and fair; But “Who the Godhead worship'd there?” This to inquire, appearing meet, Imagination lent me feet, And thither, without further cavil, I fairly undertook to travel. At once, in bright procession spied, The Female World was at my side, Mingled, like many colour'd patterns, Nymphs, mes dames, trollops, belles, and slatterns, From point, and saucy ermine, down To the plain coif, and russet gown; All, by inquiry as I found, On one important errand bound. Their van, to either tropick spread, Forerunning Expectation led; Pleasure the Female-standard bore, And Youth danced lightly on before; While Prudence, Judgment, Sense, and Taste, The few Directing Virtues, placed To form and guide a woman's mind, Discarded, sigh'd and slunk behind. At length, in jubilee, arriving, Where dwelt the jolly God of Wiveing, All prest promiscuously to enter, Nor once reflected on the venture. But here, the Muse, affecting state, Beckon'd her clamorous sex to wait, Lest such a rendezvous should hinder To say what past, the while, within door. Against the portal, full in sight, His sable vesture starr'd like night, High throned upon an ebon seat, Beneath a canopy of state, That o'er his dusky temples nodded, Was fix'd the Matrimonial Godhead. Low at his feet, in pomp display'd, The world's collected wealth was laid; Where bags of mammon, piled around, And chests on chests, o'erwhelm'd the ground, With bills, bonds, parchments, the appointers Of doweries, settlements, and jointures; From whence, in just proportion weigh'd, And down, by special tail, convey'd, The future progenies inherit Taste, beauty, virtue, sense, and merit. Whatever titles here may suit us For this same God, Hymen, or Plutus, Who, from his trade of a gold finder, Might now become a marriage-binder, And, haply, use that precious meta To solder sexes, like a kettle; No earthly God, in my opinion, Claim'd such an absolute dominion. To prove his right to adoration Through every age, and every nation, Around the spacious dome, display'd By many a fabled light and shade, Was emblematically told The great Omnipotence of Gold. And first, in yonder panel seen, A lad, call'd Paris, strolled the green, Poor, hungry, witless, and dejected, By country, and by kin, neglected; Till Fortune, as she cross'd the plain, Conceived a crotchet in her brain, And, laughing at the bashful blockhead, Took a huge pippin from her pocket, Of the true glittering tempting kind, And gold throughout from core to rind; This, in a whim, the Dame bestow'd, Then, smiling, turn'd, and went her road. The neighbours, now, when Fame had shewn 'em The youth had got the Summum Bonum, From many a hut and hamlet croud, And, duly, at his levy bow'd. His reputation spreads apace— O, such a shape, and such a face! His mouth he opens, and they swear The Delphic oracle is there. Now, see the king of Troy aspire To be the wealthy shepherd's sire. For him, the brightest nymphs contended; To him, three Goddesses descended, And shew'd, in fair and open day, Where honour, wit, and beauty lay, O'er which, our poem, to conceal From vulgar opticks, drops a veil. In the next panel, you discover Olympic Jove, that thundering lover, Who, charm'd with old Acrisius' daughter, In many a shape had vainly sought her, And run the round of all his tricks, Yet still was doubtful where to fix; Till, by some wiser head inclined, To cast his blustering bolt behind, His duller lightning to withhold, And wear the brighter form of Gold, He took the hint, he storm'd the tower, And dropt in yon omnific shower. In the next board, the tale so common is, 'Twixt Atalanta and Hippomenes, I shall but slightly stop a minute, To drop one observation in it; Remarking, that howe'er prefer'd to Their sex, for many a course in virtue, The bright allurement, well applied, May tempt good nymphs to turn aside. Next, Lybia's golden orchard grew Blooming temptation to the view, In which a dragon, call'd The Law, Kept conscientious fools in awe: Yet, Power superior to the crime, And tall Ambition skill'd to climb, With traitors of a new invention, Who sell their country for a pension, Through many a thicket won their way, And spoil'd the grove, and shared the prey. On the same golden system laid, The world was in the fifth display'd: The earth a golden axis turn'd; The heavens, with golden planets, burn'd; And thence, as astrologians know, Derived their influence below: A girdle, call'd the Zodiac, graced The glittering round of Nature's waste, Whose mystic charm from Gold arises, For this the Cæstus of the skies is: And as in Homer's works, we read (And Homer is the poet's creed) Of a well twisted golden tether, That tied the heavens and earth together, Such was the cord, or such the cable, That tied the spheres within this table; By which, the artist, underhand, Would give the wise to understand, That Interest, in every creature, Throughout religion, law, and nature, From east to west, and pole to pole, Moves, binds, suspends, and turns the whole. While thus, in passing slightly o'er, I Surveyed the scenes of ancient story; Or eyed, with more minute attention, What Prudence, here, forbids to mention; The Muse my shoulder tapp'd, to mind me Of things that pass'd, the while, behind me. I turn'd, and view'd, with deep surprize, The phantom that assail'd my eyes: His hinder-head disrobed of hair, His sapless back, and shoulders bare, Confest the wrinkles of a sage Who past ten Nestors in his age; But cloathed before, with decent grace, And infant sweetness in his face, Not Smintheus with such vigour strung, Nor blooming Hebe look'd so young. On his left hand a palette lay, With many a teint of colours gay; While, guided with an easy slight, The flying pencil graced his right. Unnumber'd canvasses appear'd, Before the moving artist rear'd, On whose inspirited expanse he Exprest the creatures of his fancy; So touch'd, with such a swift command, With such a magic power of hand, That Nature, did, herself, appear Less real than her semblance here, And, not a mortal, so betray'd, Could know the substance from the shade! Whate'er the world conceives, in life, Worth toil, anxiety, and strife; Whate'er by Ignorance is bought, By Madness wish'd, or Folly sought, The mitres, coronets, and garters, To which Ambition leads his martyrs; With every joy, and toy, that can Amuse the various child of man, Was painted here in many a scene, A trifling, transient, charming train! Awhile I stood, in thought suspended, To guess what these affairs intended; When, lo, the Muse, in whispers, told, “'Tis Father Time whom you behold; “In part discovered to the Wise, “In part conceal'd from human eyes. “A slave to yon Gold-giving Power, “For him he spends each restless hour; “The product of his toil intends “As gifts to those his God befriends, “And paints what other mortals view “As substances, though shades to you.” She ceas'd, and turning to the sentry, Desired he'd give the Ladies entry; And straight the portal opened wide, And in they deluged like a tide. So, to some grove, by stress of weather, Fast flock the fowl of every feather; A mighty, pretty, prating rabble, Like Iris rigg'd, and tongued like Babel; Then crowding toward the nuptial throne, By bags of strong attraction known, Low bending to their God they bow'd, And vented thus their prayer aloud: “Great Power! in whom our sex confides, “Who rulest the turns of female tides, “Who kenst, while varying Fancy ranges “Through all its doubles, twirles, and changes, “To what a Woman's heart is prone, “A secret to ourselves unknown— “O, give us, give us, Mighty Power! “The wedded joy of every hour: “Assign thy favourites, in marriage, “To coaches of distinguish'd carriage; “To all the frippery of dressing, “A nameless, boundless, endless blessing; “To drums, ridottos, sights and sounds; “To visits in eternal rounds; “To card and counter, rake and rattle; “To the whole lust of tongue and tattle; “And all the dear delightful trances “Of countless frolicks, fits, and fancies. “You have heard, that men, unpolish'd boors! “Lay naughty passions at our doors; “'Tis your's to contradict the lyar, “Who are, yourself, our chief desire. “O then, as widow, or as wife, “To you we yield each choice in life; “Or would you every prayer fulfil, “Wed us! O! wed us, to our will!” They ceas'd, and, without more addition, The God confirm'd their full petition: To Time he beckon'd, and desired He'd give the good each nymph required; And, from his visionary treasure, Wed every woman to her pleasure. The first, who came, resolv'd to fix Upon a gilded coach and fix; The suit was granted her on sight, The nymph with ardour seiz'd her right. A wonder! by possession banish'd, The coach and dappled coursers vanish'd; And a foul waggon held the Fair Full laden with a weight of care: She sigh'd; her sisters caught the sound, And one insulting laugh went round. The second was a dame of Britain, Who by a coronet was smitten; With boldness she advanced her claim, Exulting in so just a flame. But ah, where bliss alone was patent, What unsuspected mischief latent! The worst in all Pandora's box, Her coronet contain'd a ?. With this example in her eye, The third, a widow'd dame, drew nigh, And fix'd her sight and soul together Upon a raking hat and feather; Nor sigh'd in vain, but seiz'd her due, And clasp'd old age in twenty-two. Thus, through the difference and degrees Of sword-knots, mitres, and toupees, Prim bands, pert bobs, and well hung blades, Long robes, smart jackets, fierce cockades, And all the fooleries in fashion, Whate'er became the darling passion, The good for which they did importune, Was straight revers'd into misfortune; And every woman, like the first, Was, at her own entreaty, curst. At length, was introduced a Fair, With such a face, and such an air. As never was, on earth, I ween, Save by poetic organs, seen. With decent grace, and gentle cheer, The bright Adventurer drew near; Her mild approach the Godhead spied, And, “Fairest,” with a smile, he cried, “If aught you seek in Hymen's power, “You find him in a happy hour.” At this, the Virgin, half amazed, As round the spacious dome she gazed, With caution every symbol eyed, And, blushing, gracefully replied. “If you are he, whose power controuls “And knits the sympathy of souls, “Then, whence this pomp of worthless geer, “And why this heap of counters here? “Is this vain shew of glittering ore, “The bliss, that Hymen has in store? “Love sees the folly, with the gloss, “And laughs to scorn thy useless dross. “Where are the symbols of thy reign? “And where thy robe of Tyrian grain, “Whose teint, in virgin-colours dyed, “Derives its blushing from the bride? “Where is thy torch, serenely bright, “To lovers yielding warmth and light, “That from the heart derives its fire, “And only can, with life, expire? “Will this unactive mass impart “The social feelings of the heart? “Or can material fetters bind “The free affections of the mind? “Through every age, the Great, and Wise, “Behold thee with superior eyes; “Love spurns thy treasures with disdain, “And Virtue flies thy hostile reign. “By Love, congenial souls embrace, “Celestial source of human race! “From whence, the cordial sense within, “The bosom'd amities of kin, “The call of nature to her kind, “And all the tunings of the mind, “That, winding Heaven's harmonious plan, “Compose the brotherhood of man.” She said, and gracefully withdrew; Her steps the Muse and I pursue. Along an unfrequented way The Virgin led, nor led astray; Till, like the first, in form and size, A second Fabric struck our eyes: We enter'd, guided by the Fair, And saw a second Hymen there. A silken robe, of saffron hue, About his decent shoulders flew; While a fair taper's virgin light Gave Ovid to his soul and sight. An hundred Cupids wanton'd round, Whose useless quivers strow'd the ground; While, careless of their wonted trade, They with the Smiling Graces play'd. Along the wall's extended side, With teints of varying nature dyed, In needled tapestry, was told The tale of many a love of old. In groves, that breathed a citron air, Together walk'd the wedded pair; Or toy'd upon the vernal ground, Their beauteous offspring sporting round; Or, lock'd in sweet embracement, lay, And slept, and loved, the night away. There sat Penelope in tears, Besieged, like Troy, for ten long years: Her suitors, in a neighbouring room, Wait the long promise of the loom, Which she defers, from day to day, Till death, determin'd to delay. With thoughts of fond remembrance wrung, Deep sorrowing, o'er her work she hung; Where, in the fields, at Ilium fought, The labours of her lord she wrought, The toil, the dust, the flying foe, The rallied host, the instant blow; Then, sighing, trembled at the view, Scared at the dangers which she drew. There too, suspended o'er the wave, Alcione was seen to rave, When, as the foundering wreck she spied, She on her sinking Ceÿx cried: Her Ceÿx, though by seas opprest, Still bears her image in his breast; And, with his fondest latest breath, Murmurs, “Alcione!” in death. Panthea there, upon a bier, Laid the sole lord of her desire: His limbs were scatter'd through the plains; She join'd, and kiss'd, the dear remains. Too ponderous was her weight of woe, For sighs to rise, or tears to flow; On the loved corse she fix'd her view, Nor other use of seeing knew; While high and stedfast as she gazed, Her snowy arm a poniard raised, Nor yet the desperate weapon staid, But, for a longer look, delayed, Till, plunged within her beauteous breast, She on his bosom sunk to rest. But, O, beyond whate'er was told In modern tales, or truths of old, One Pair, in form and spirit twined, Out loved the loves of human kind; She Hero, he Leander, named, For mutual faith, as beauty, famed! Their story, from its source, begun, And, to the fatal period, run. While, bow'd at Cytherea's shrine, The Youth adores her power divine, He sees her blooming priestess there, Beyond the sea-born goddess, fair: She, as some God, the stripling eyes, Just lighted from his native skies— The God, whose chariot guides the hour; Or haply, Love's immortal power. At once, their conscious glances spoke, Like fate, the strong and mutual stroke; Attracted by a secret force, Like currents meeting in their course, That, thence, one stream for ever rolls, Together rush'd their mingling souls, Too close for fortune to divide, For each was lost in either tide. In vain, by ruthless parents torn, Their bodies are asunder born, And towering bulwarks intervene, And envious ocean rolls between; Love wings their letters o'er the sea, And kisses melt the seals away. And now the sable night impends, Leander to the shore descends, Exults at the appointed hour, And marks the signal on the tower— A torch, to guide the Lover's way, Endear'd beyond the brightest day! At once, he plunges in the tide; His arms the Hellespont divide; The danger and the toil he braves, And dashes the contending waves. While near, and nearer to his sight, The taper darts a ruddier light, Recruited at the view, he glows; Aside the whelming billow throws: The winds and seas oppose in vain; He spurns, he mounts, he skims the main. Now, from the tower, where Hero stood, And threw a radiance o'er the flood, Leander, in the deep, she spied, And would have sprung to join his side; Howe'er, her wishes make essay, And clasp and warm him on his way. The main is cross'd, the shore is gain'd, The long wish'd hour, at last, attain'd. But, lovers, if there e'er arose A pair, so form'd and fond as those, So loved, so beauteous, and so blest, Alone can speak or think the rest; Nor will the weeping muse unfold The close, too tragic to be told! Long were the loving list to name, With Portia's faith, that swallow'd flame: But much the longer list were those Whose joys were unallay'd by woes; Whose bliss no cruel parents crost, Whose love not ages could exhaust, Where not a cloud did intervene, Or once o'er-cast their bright serene, But, through the summer's day of life, The husband tender as the wife, Like Henry and his Nut-brown Maid, Their faith nor shaken nor decay'd, Together ran the blissful race, Together lived, and slept in peace. Long time, the much inquiring Maid, From story, on to story stray'd; Joy'd in the joys that lovers know, Or wept her tribute to their woe; Till Hymen, with a placid air, Approaching, thus addrest the Fair. “Hail to the Nymph, whose sacred train “Of virtues shall restore my reign! “Whate'er the wishes of thy soul, “But speak them, and possess the whole.” “Thanks, gentle Power,” the Maid replied; “Your bounty shall be amply tried. “I seek not titles, rank, or state, “Superfluous to the truly great; “Nor yet, to sordid wealth inclined, “The poorest passion of the mind; “But, simply fix'd to nature's plan, “I seek the Associate in the Man. “Yet, O beware! for much depends “On what that syllable intends. “Give him a form that may delight “My inward sense, my mental sight; “In every outward act, design'd “To speak an elegance of mind. “In him, by science, travel, taste, “Be nature polish'd, not defaced; “And set, as is the brilliant stone, “To be, with double lustre, shewn. “Sweet be the music of his tongue, “And, as the lyre of David, strung, “To steal, from each delighted day, “Affliction, care, and time, away. “Within his comprehensive soul “Let Heaven's Harmonious System roll; “There let the Great, the Good, the Wise, “Of famed antiquity arise, “From every age and every clime, “Eluding death, and circling time! “There let the Sacred Virtues meet, “And range their known and native seat! “There let the Charities unite, “And Human Feelings weep Delight!” “Kind Power! if Such a Youth you know, “He's all the Heaven I ask, below.” So wish'd the much aspiring Maid; Pale turn'd the Power, and, sighing, said: “Alas! like him you fondly claim, “Through every boasted form and name, “That graces Nature's varying round, “A Second is not to be found! “Your suit, Fair Creature, must miscarry, “Till CHARLEMONT resolves to marry.” THE SPARROW and the DOVE. It was, as learn'd traditions say, Upon an April's blithsome day, When Pleasure, ever on the wing, Return'd companion of the spring, And chear'd the birds with amorous heat, Instructing little hearts to beat; A Sparrow, frolic, gay, and young, Of bold address, and flippant tongue, Just left his lady of a night, Like him, to follow new delight. The youth, of many a conquest vain, Flew off to seek the chirping train; The chirping train he quickly found, And with a saucy ease bow'd round. For every she his bosom burns, And this, and that, he wooes by turns; And here a sigh, and there a bill, And here—“those eyes, so form'd to kill!” And now, with ready tongue, he strings Unmeaning, soft, resistless things; With vows and dem-me's skill'd to woo, As other pretty fellows do. Not that he thought this short essay A prologue needful to his play; No, trust me, says our learned letter, He knew the virtuous sex much better: But these he held as specious arts, To shew his own superior parts; The form of decency to shield, And give a just pretence to yield. Thus finishing his courtly play, He mark'd the favourite of a day; With careless impudence drew near, And whisper'd hebrew in her ear; A hint, which, like the mason's sign, The conscious can alone define. The fluttering nymph, expert at feigning, Cried, “Sir—pray, sir, explain your meaning— “Go, prate to those that may endure ye— “To me this rudeness!—I'll assure ye!”— Then off she glided, like a swallow, As saying—you guess where to follow. To such as know the party set, 'Tis needless to declare they met; The parson's barn, as authors mention, Confest the fair had apprehension. Her honour there secure from stain, She held all further trifling vain, No more affected to be coy, But rush'd licentious on the joy. “Hist, love!”—the male companion cried; “Retire a while, I fear we are spied.” Nor was the caution vain; he saw A Turtle rustling in the straw, While o'er her callow brood she hung, And fondly thus addrest her young. Ye tender objects of my care! Peace, peace, ye little helpless pair! Anon he comes, your gentle sire, And brings you all your hearts require. For us, his infants, and his bride, For us, with only love to guide, Our lord assumes an eagle's speed, And like a lion dares to bleed. Nor yet by wintry skies confined, He mounts upon the rudest wind; From danger tears the vital spoil, And with affection sweetens toil. Ah cease, too venturous! cease to dare; In thine, our dearer safety spare! From him, ye cruel falcons, stray; And turn, ye fowlers, far away! Should I survive to see the day, That tears me from myself away, That cancels all that Heaven could give, The life by which alone I live; Alas, how more than lost were I, Who, in the thought, already die! Ye Powers, whom men and birds obey, Great rulers of your creatures, say, Why mourning comes, by bliss convey'd, And even the sweets of love allay'd? Where grows enjoyment, tall, and fair, Around it twines entangling care; While fear for what our souls possess, Enervates every power to bless: Yet friendship forms the bliss above; And, life! what art thou, without Love? Our Hero, who had heard apart, Felt something moving in his heart; But quickly, with disdain, supprest The virtue rising in his breast: And first he feign'd to laugh aloud; And next, approaching, smiled and bow'd. “Madam, you must not think me rude; “Good manners never can intrude. “I vow I come thro' pure good nature— “Upon my soul, a charming creature!— “Are these the comforts of a wife? “This careful, cloister'd, moaping life? “No doubt, that odious thing, call'd duty, “Is a sweet province for a beauty. “Thou pretty ignorance! thy will “Is measured to thy want of skill; “That good old-fashion'd dame, thy mother, “Has taught thy infant years no other— “The greatest ill in the creation, “Is sure the want of education! “But think ye?—tell me without feigning, “Have all these charms no further meaning? “Dame nature, if you don't forget her, “Might teach your ladyship much better. “For shame, reject this mean employment; “Enter the world, and taste enjoyment, “Where time, by circling bliss, we measure; “Beauty was form'd alone for pleasure! “Come, prove the blessing, follow me; “Be wise, be happy, and be free.” “Kind sir,” replied our Matron chaste, “Your zeal seems pretty much in haste. “I own, the fondness to be blest, “Is a deep thirst in every breast: “Of blessings too I have my store; “Yet quarrel not, should Heaven give more. “Then prove the change to be expedient, “And think me, sir, your most obedient.” Here turning, as to one inferior, Our Gallant spoke, and smiled superior. “Methinks, to quit your boasted station, “Requires a world of hesitation! “Where brats and bonds are held a blessing, “The case, I doubt, is past redressing. “Why, child, suppose the joys I mention, “Were the mere fruits of my invention, “You've cause sufficient for your carriage, “In flying from the curse of marriage; “That sly decoy, with varied snares, “That takes your widgeons in by pairs; “Alike to husband, and to wife, “The cure of love, and bane of life; “The only method of forecasting, “To make misfortune firm and lasting; “The sin, by heaven's peculiar sentence, “Unpardon'd, through a life's repentance: “It is the double snake, that weds “A common tail to different heads, “That lead the carcass still astray, “By dragging each a different way. “Of all the ills that may attend me, “From marriage, mighty gods, defend me! “Give me frank nature's wild demesne, “And boundless tract of air serene, “Where Fancy, ever wing'd for change, “Delights to sport, delights to range. “There, Liberty! to thee is owing “Whate'er of bliss is worth bestowing: “Delights, still varied, and divine, “Sweet goddess of the hills! are thine. “What say you now, you pretty pink you? “Have I for once spoke reason, think you? “You take me now for no romancer— “Come, never study for an answer; “Away, cast every care behind ye, “And fly where joy alone shall find ye.” “Soft yet,” return'd our female fencer, “A question more, or so—and then, sir. “You have rallied me with sense exceeding, “With much fine wit, and better breeding: “But pray, sir, how do you contrive it? “Do those of your world never wive it?” No, no—“How then?”—Why dare I tell?— What does the business full as well. “Do you ne'er love?”—An hour at leisure. “Have you no friendships?”—Yes, for pleasure. “No care for little ones?”—We get 'em; The rest the mothers mind, and let 'em. “Thou wretch,” rejoin'd the kindling Dove, “Quite lost to life, as lost to love! “Whene'er misfortune comes, how just! “And come misfortune surely must; “In the dread season of dismay, “In that your hour of trial, say, “Who then shall prop your sinking heart? “Who bear affliction's weightier part? “Say, when the black-brow'd welkin bends, “And winter's gloomy form impends, “To mourning turns all transient chear, “And blasts the melancholy year; “For times, at no persuasion, stay, “Nor vice can find perpetual May; “Then where's that tongue, by folly fed? “That soul of pertness, whither fled? “All shrunk within thy lonely nest, “Forlorn, abandon'd, and unblest! “No friends, by cordial bonds allied, “Shall seek thy cold unsocial side; “No chirping prattlers, to delight “Shall turn the long-enduring night; “No bride her words of balm impart, “And warm thee at her constant heart. “Freedom, restrained by Reason's force, “Is as the sun's unvarying course, “Benignly active, sweetly bright, “Affording warmth, affording light; “But torn from Virtue's sacred rules, “Becomes a comet, gazed by fools, “Foreboding cares, and storms, and strife, “And fraught with all the plagues of life. “Thou fool! by Union, every creature “Subsists through universal nature; “And this, to beings void of mind, “Is wedlock of a meaner kind. “While womb'd in space, primæval clay “A yet unfashion'd embryo lay, “The Source of Endless Good above “Shot down his spark of kindling Love: “Touch'd by the all-enlivening flame, “Then motion first exulting came; “Each atom sought its separate class, “Through many a fair enamour'd mass; “Love cast the central charm around, “And with eternal nuptials bound. “Then form and order, o'er the sky, “First train'd their bridal pomp on high; “The sun display'd his orb to sight, “And burnt with hymeneal light. “Hence nature's virgin-womb conceived, “And with the genial burden heaved: “Forth came the oak, her first born heir, “And scaled the breathing steep of air; “Then infant stems, of various use, “Imbibed her soft maternal juice; “The flowers, in early bloom disclosed, “Upon her fragrant breast reposed; “Within her warm embraces grew, “A race of endless form and hue; “Then pour'd her lesser offspring round, “And fondly cloath'd their parent ground. “Nor here alone the virtue reign'd, “By matter's cumbering form detain'd; “But thence, subliming, and refined, “Aspired, and reach'd its kindred Mind: “Caught in the fond, celestial fire, “The mind perceived unknown desire; “And now with kind effusion flow'd, “And now with cordial ardours glow'd; “Beheld the sympathetic Fair, “And loved its own resemblance there; “On all with circling radiance shone, “But, centering, fix'd on one alone; “There clasp'd the heaven-appointed Wife, “And doubled every joy of life. “Here ever blessing, ever blest, “Resides this beauty of the breast; “As from his palace, here the God “Still beams effulgent bliss abroad; “Here gems his own eternal round, “The ring, by which the world is bound; “Here bids his seat of empire grow, “And builds his little Heaven below. “The bridal partners thus allied, “And thus in sweet accordance tied, “One body, heart, and spirit, live, “Enrich'd by every joy they give; “Like echo, from her vocal hold, “Return'd in music twenty fold. “Their union firm, and undecay'd, “Nor time can shake, nor power invade; “But as the stem and scion stand, “Ingrafted by a skilful hand, “They check the tempest's wintry rage, “And bloom and strengthen into age. “A thousand amities unknown, “And powers, perceiv'd by Love alone, “Endearing looks, and chaste desire, “Fan and support the mutual fire, “Whose flame, perpetual as refined, “Is fed by an immortal mind. “Nor yet the nuptial sanction ends; “Like Nile it opens, and descends, “Which, by apparent windings led, “We trace to its celestial head: “The sire, first springing from above, “Becomes the source of life and love, “And gives his filial heir to flow, “In fondness down on sons below. “Thus roll'd in one continued tide, “To time's extremest verge they glide; “While kindred streams, on either hand, “Branch forth in blessings o'er the land. “Thee, wretch! no lisping babe shall name, “No late-returning brother claim, “No kinsman on thy road rejoice, “No sister greet thy entering voice, “With partial eyes no parents see, “And bless their years restored in thee. “In age rejected, or declined, “An alien even among thy kind, “The partner of thy scorn'd embrace “Shall play the wanton in thy face; “Each spark unplume thy little pride, “All friendship fly thy faithless side; “Thy name shall like thy carcass rot, “In sickness spurn'd, in death forgot. “All giving Pow'r! great Source of Life! “O hear the parent! hear the wife! “That life thou lendest from above, “Though little, make it large in love! “O bid my feeling heart expand “To every claim, on every hand; “To those from whom my days I drew, “To these in whom those days renew; “To all my kin, however wide, “In cordial warmth, as blood allied; “To friends, with steelly fetters twined, “And to the cruel not unkind! “But chief, the lord of my desire, “My life, myself, my soul, my sire, “Friends, children, all that wish can claim, “Chaste passion clasp, and rapture name; “O spare him, spare him, Gracious Power! “O give him to my latest hour! “Let me my length of life employ, “To give my sole enjoyment joy; “His love, let mutual love excite; “Turn all my cares to his delight; “And every needless blessing spare, “Wherein my darling wants a share. “When he with graceful action wooes “And sweetly bills, and fondly cooes, “Ah! deck me, to his eyes alone, “With charms attractive as his own; “And in my circling wings carest, “Give all the lover to my breast. “Then in our chaste, connubial bed, “My bosom pillow'd for him head, “His eyes with blisful slumbers close, “And watch, with me, my lord's repose; “Your peace around his temples twine, “And love him, with a love like mine. “And, for I know his generous flame, “Beyond whate'er my sex can claim, “Me too to your protection take, “And spare me for my husband's sake. “Let one unruffled calm delight “The loving, and beloved unite; “One pure desire our bosoms warm, “One will direct, one wish inform; “Through life, one mutual aid sustain; “In death, one peaceful grave contain!” While, swelling with the darling theme, Her accents pour'd an endless stream, The well-known wings a sound impart, That reach'd her ear, and touch'd her heart: Quick dropp'd the music of her tongue, And forth, with eager joy, she sprung; As swift her entering consort flew, And plumed and kindled at the view; Their wings their souls embracing meet, Their hearts with answering measure beat; Half lost in sacred sweets, and blest With raptures felt, but ne'er exprest. Straight to her humble roof she led The partner of her spotless bed: Her young, a fluttering pair, arise, Their welcome sparkling in their eyes; Transported, to their sire they bound, And hang with speechless action round. In pleasure wrapt, the parents stand, And see their little wings expand; The sire, his life sustaining prize To each expecting bill applies, There fondly pours the wheaten spoil, With transport given, tho' won with toil; While, all collected at the sight, And silent through supreme delight, The Fair high Heaven of bliss beguiles, And on her lord and infants smiles. The Sparrow, whose attention hung Upon the Dove's enchanting tongue, Of all his little slights disarm'd, And from himself, by Virtue, charm'd; When now he saw, what only seem'd, A fact, so late a fable deem'd, His soul to envy he resigned, His hours of folly to the wind; In secret wish'd a Turtle too, And sighing to himself withdrew. THE FEMALE SEDUCERS. 'Tis said of widow, maid, and wife, That Honour is a woman's life: Unhappy sex! who only claim A being, in the breath of Fame, Which tainted, not the quickening gales That sweep Sabæa's spicy vales, Nor all the healing sweets restore, That breathe along Arabia's shore. The traveller, if he chance to stray, May turn uncensured to his way; Polluted streams again are pure, And deepest wounds admit a cure: But woman no redemption knows; The wounds of Honour never close! Tho' distant every hand to guide, Nor skill'd on life's tempestuous tide, If once her feeble bark recede, Or deviate from the course decreed, In vain she seeks the friendless shore— Her swifter folly flies before; The circling ports against her close, And shut the wanderer from repose; 'Till, by conflicting waves opprest, Her foundering pinnace sinks to rest. “Are there no offerings to atone, “For but a single error?”—None. Tho' woman is avow'd, of old, No daughter of celestial mould, Her tempering not without allay, And form'd but of the finer clay, We challenge from the mortal dame The strength angelic natures claim; Nay more; for sacred stories tell, That even Immortal Angels fell. “Whatever fills the teeming sphere “Of humid earth, and ambient air, “With varying elements endued, “Was form'd to fall, and rise renew'd. “The stars no fix'd duration know; “Wide oceans ebb, again to flow; “The moon repletes her waining face, “All-beauteous, from her late disgrace; “And suns, that mourn approaching night, “Refulgent rise with new-born light. “In vain may Death and Time subdue, “While Nature mints her race anew, “And holds some vital spark apart, “Like Virtue, hid in every heart: “'Tis hence, reviving warmth is seen “To cloath a naked world in green; “No longer barr'd by winter's cold, “Again the gates of life unfold; “Again each insect tries his wing, “And lifts fresh pinions on the spring; “Again, from every latent root, “The bladed stem and tendril shoot, “Exhaling incense to the skies, “Again to perish, and to rise. “And must weak woman then disown “The change, to which a world is prone? “In one meridian brightness shine, “And ne'er like evening suns decline? “Resolved and firm alone?—Is this “What we demand of woman?”—Yes. “But should the spark of vestal fire, “In some unguarded hour expire; “Or should the nightly thief invade “Hesperia's chaste and sacred shade, “Of all the blooming spoil possest, “The dragon Honour charm'd to rest; “Shall Virtue's flame no more return? “No more with virgin splendor burn? “No more the ravaged garden blow “With spring's succeeding blossom?”—No: Pity may mourn, but not restore; And woman falls, to rise no more! WITHIN this sublunary sphere, A country lies—no matter where; The clime may readily be found, By all who tread poetic ground. A stream, call'd Life, across it glides, And equally the land divides: And here, of Vice the province lies; And there, the hills of Virtue rise! Upon a mountain's airy stand, Whose summit look'd to either land, An Ancient Pair their dwelling chose, As well for prospect, as repose; For mutual faith they long were famed, And Temperance, and Religion, named. A numerous progeny divine, Confest the honours of their line: But in a little Daughter fair, Was center'd more than half their care; For Heaven, to gratulate her birth, Gave signs of future joy to earth: White was the robe this infant wore, And Chastity the name she bore. As now the Maid in stature grew, A flower just opening to the view! Oft thro' her native lawns she stray'd, And wrestling with the lambkins play'd: Her looks diffusive sweets bequeath'd, The breeze grew purer as she breath'd; The morn her radiant blush assumed, The spring with earlier fragrance bloom'd; And Nature yearly took delight, Like her, to dress the world in white. But when her rising form was seen To reach the crisis of fifteen, Her parents up the mountain's head, With anxious step their darling led; By turns they snatch'd her to their breast, And thus the fears of age exprest. “O joyful cause of many a care! “O daughter, too divinely fair! “Yon world, on this important day, “Demands thee to a dangerous way; “A painful journey all must go, “Whose doubtful period none can know; “Whose due direction who can find, “Where Reason's mute, and Sense is blind? “Ah, what unequal leaders these, “Thro' such a wide perplexing maze! “Then mark the warnings of the wise, “And learn what love and years advise. “Far to the right thy prospect bend, “Where yonder towering hills ascend: “Lo, there the arduous path's in view, “Which Virtue, and her sons pursue; “With toil o'er lessening earth they rise, “And gain, and gain, upon the skies! “Narrow's the way her children tread; “No walk for pleasure smoothly spread, “But rough, and difficult, and steep, “Painful to climb, and hard to keep. “Fruits immature those lands dispense, “A food indelicate to sense, “Of taste unpleasant; yet from those “Pure health with chearful vigour flows, “And strength unfeeling of decay, “Throughout the long laborious way. “Hence, as they scale that Heavenly road, “Each limb is lightened of its load; “From earth refining still they go, “And leave the mortal weight below: “Then spreads the strait, the doubtful clears, “And smooth the rugged path appears; “For custom turns fatigue to ease, “And, taught by Virtue, pain can please. “At length, the toilsome journey o'er, “And near the bright celestial shore, “A gulph, black, fearful, and profound, “Appears, of either world the bound, “Thro' darkness leading up to light: “Sense backwards shrinks, and shuns the sight; “For there the transitory train, “Of time, and form, and care, and pain, “And matter's gross incumbering mass, “Man's late associates, cannot pass, “But sinking, quit the immortal charge, “And leave the wondering soul at large; “Lightly she wings her obvious way, “And mingles with eternal day. “Thither, O thither, wing thy speed, “Tho' Pleasure charm, or Pain impede! “To such the All-bounteous Power has given, “For present earth, a future Heaven; “For trivial loss, unmeasured gain; “And endless bliss, for transient pain. “Then fear, ah! fear to turn thy sight, “Where yonder flowery fields invite; “Wide on the left the path-way bends, “And with pernicious ease descends: “There sweet to sense, and fair to show, “New-planted Edens seem to blow, “Trees that delicious poison bear, “For death is vegetable there. “Hence is the frame of health unbraced, “Each sinew slackening at the taste; “The soul to passion yields her throne, “And sees with organs not her own; “While, like the slumberer in the night, “Pleased with the shadowy dream of light, “Before her alienated eyes, “The scenes of fairy land arise; “The puppet world's amusing show, “Dipt in the gayly colour'd bow, “Scepters, and wreaths, and glittering things, “The toys of infants, and of kings, “That tempt, along the baneful plain, “The idly wise, and lightly vain; “Till verging on the gulphy shore, “Sudden they sink, and rise no more. “But list to what thy fates declare; “Tho' thou art Woman, frail as fair, “If once thy sliding foot should stray, “Once quit yon Heaven-appointed way, “For thee, lost Maid, for thee alone, “Nor prayers shall plead, nor tears atone: “Reproach, scorn, infamy, and hate, “On thy returning steps shall wait; “Thy form be loathed by every eye, “And every foot thy presence fly.” Thus arm'd with words of potent sound, Like guardian-angels placed around, A charm by Truth divinely cast, Forward, our young Adventurer past: Forth from her sacred eye-lids sent, Like morn, fore-running radiance went; While Honour, hand-maid late assigned, Upheld her lucid train behind. Awe-struck the much admiring-crowd Before the Virgin Vision bow'd, Gazed with an ever new delight, And caught fresh virtue at the sight: For not of earth's unequal frame They deem the Heaven-compounded dame; If matter, sure the most refined, High wrought, and temper'd into mind! Some darling daughter of the day, And bodied by her native ray! Where e'er she passes, thousands bend; And thousands, where she moves, attend; Her ways observant eyes confess, Her steps pursuing praises bless; While to the elevated Maid Oblations, as to Heaven, are paid. 'Twas on an ever blithsome day, The jovial birth of rosy May, When genial warmth, no more supprest, New melts the frost in every breast, The cheek with secret flushing dyes, And looks kind things from chastest eyes; The sun with healthier visage glows, Aside his clouded 'kerchief throws, And dances up the etherial plain, Where late he used to climb with pain; While Nature, as from bonds set free, Springs out, and gives a loose to glee. And now, for momentary rest, The Nymph her travell'd step represt; Just turn'd to view the stage attain'd, And gloried in the height she had gain'd. Out-stretch'd before her wide survey, The realms of sweet perdition lay, And pity touch'd her soul with woe, To see a world so lost below; When straight the breeze began to breathe Airs gently wafted from beneath, That bore commission'd witchcraft thence, And reach'd her sympathy of sense; No sounds of discord, that disclose A people sunk and lost in woes, But as of present good possest, The very triumph of the blest. The Maid in rapt attention hung, While thus approaching Sirens sung. “Hither, Fairest, hither haste! “Brightest Beauty, come and taste “What the powers of bliss unfold, “Joys too mighty to be told! “Taste what extasies they give— “Dying raptures taste and live. “In thy lap, disdaining measure, “Nature empties all her treasure; “Soft desires that sweetly languish, “Fierce delights that rise to anguish! “Fairest, dost thou yet delay? “Brightest Beauty, come away! “List not, when the froward chide, “Sons of pedantry and pride; “Snarlers, to whose feeble sense “April's sunshine is offence; “Age and envy will advise, “Even against the joy they prize. “Come, in Pleasure's balmy bowl, “Slake the thirstings of thy soul, “Till thy raptured powers are fainting, “With enjoyment past the painting: “Fairest, dost thou yet delay? “Brightest Beauty, come away!” So sung the Sirens, as of yore, Upon the false Ausonian shore; And O! for that preventing chain, That bound Ulysses on the main, That so our Fair One might withstand The covert ruin now at hand. The song her charm'd attention drew, When now the Tempters stood in view— Curiosity, with prying eyes, And hands of busy bold emprise; Like Hermes, feather'd were her feet, And, like fore-running Fancy, fleet: By search untaught, by toil untired, To novelty she still aspired; Tasteless of every good possest, And but in expectation blest. With her, associate, Pleasure came, Gay Pleasure, frolic-loving dame; Her mien all swimming in delight, Her beauties half revealed to sight; Loose flowed her garments from the ground, And caught the kissing winds around. As erst Medusa's looks were known To turn beholders into stone, A dire reversion here they felt, And in the eye of Pleasure melt. Her glance with sweet persuasion charm'd, Unnerv'd the strong, the steel'd disarm'd; No safety even the flying find, Who, venturous, look but once behind. Thus was the much-admiring Maid, While distant, more than half-betray'd. With smiles, and adulation bland, They join'd her side, and seiz'd her hand: Their touch envenom'd sweets instill'd, Her frame with new pulsations thrill'd; While half consenting, half denying, Reluctant now, and now complying, Amidst a war of hopes and fears, Of trembling wishes, smiling tears, Still down, and down, the winning Pair Compell'd the struggling yielding Fair. As when some stately vessel, bound To blest Arabia's distant ground, Borne from her courses, haply lights Where Barca's flowery clime invites, Conceal'd around whose treacherous land, Lurk the dire rock, and dangerous sand; The pilot warns, with sail and oar To shun the much suspected shore— In vain; the tide, too subtly strong, Still bears the wrestling bark along; Till foundering, she resigns to fate, And sinks o'erwhelm'd with all her freight. So, baffling every bar to sin, And Heaven's own Pilot placed within, Along the devious smooth descent, With powers increasing as they went, The Dames, accustom'd to subdue, As with a rapid current drew; And o'er the fatal bounds convey'd The lost the long reluctant Maid. Here stop, ye Fair Ones, and beware, Nor send your fond affections there: Yet, yet, your Darling, now deplored, May turn, to you, and Heaven, restored; Till then, with weeping Honour wait, The servant of her better fate, With Honour left upon the shore, Her friend and handmaid now no more; Nor, with the guilty world, upbraid The fortunes of a wretch betray'd, But o'er her failing cast a veil, Remembring you yourselves are frail. And now, from all-enquiring light, Fast fled the conscious shades of night; The Damsel, from a short repose, Confounded at her plight, arose. As when, with slumberous weight opprest, Some wealthy miser sinks to rest, Where felons eye the glittering prey, And steal his hoard of joys away; He, borne where golden Indus streams, Of pearl and quarry'd diamond dreams; Like Midas, turns the glebe to oar, And stands all wrapt amidst his store; But wakens, naked, and despoil'd Of that, for which his years had toil'd. So fared the Nymph—her treasure flown, And turn'd, like Niobe, to stone; Within, without, obscure and void, She felt all ravaged, all destroy'd: And, “O thou curs'd, insidious coast! “Are these the blessings thou can'st boast? “These, Virtue! these the joys they find, “Who leave thy heaven-topt hills behind? “Shade me ye pines, ye caverns hide, “Ye mountains cover me!” she cried. Her trumpet Slander raised on high, And told the tidings to the sky; Contempt discharged a living dart, A side-long viper to her heart; Reproach breathed poisons o'er her face, And soil'd and blasted every grace: Officious Shame, her handmaid new, Still turn'd the mirror to her view, While those, in crimes the deepest dyed, Approach'd to whiten at her side, And every lewd insulting dame Upon her folly rose to fame. What should she do?—attempt once more To gain the late-deserted shore? So trusting, back the Mourner flew; As fast the train of fiends pursue. Again the farther shore's attain'd, Again the land of Virtue gain'd; But echo gathers in the wind, And shows her instant foes behind. Amazed, with headlong speed she tends, Where late she left an host of friends; Alas! those shrinking friends decline, Nor longer own that form divine: With fear they mark the following cry, And from the lonely Trembler fly; Or backward drive her on the coast, Where peace was wreck'd, and honour lost. From earth thus hoping aid in vain, To Heaven not daring to complain, No truce by hostile clamour given, And from the face of friendship driven; The Nymph sunk prostrate on the ground, With all her weight of woes around. Enthroned within a circling sky, Upon a mount, o'er mountains high, All radiant sate, as in a shrine, Virtue, First Effluence Divine, Far, far above the scenes of woe, That shut this cloud-wrapt world below; Superior Goddess, essence bright, Beauty of Uncreated Light, Whom should mortality survey, As doom'd upon a certain day, The breath of frailty must expire; The world dissolve in living fire; The gems of Heaven, and solar flame, Be quench'd by her eternal beam; And Nature, quickening in her eye, To rise a new-born phœnix, die. Hence, unreveal'd to mortal view, A veil around her form she threw, Which three sad sisters of the shade Pain, Care, and Melancholy made. Thro' this her all-enquiring eye, Attentive from her station high, Beheld, abandon'd to despair, The ruins of her Favourite Fair; And with a voice, whose awful sound Appall'd the guilty world around, Bid the tumultuous winds be still, To numbers bow'd each listening hill, Uncurl'd the surging of the main, And smooth'd the thorny bed of pain; The golden harp of Heaven she strung, And thus the tuneful Goddess sung. “Lovely Penitent, arise! “Come, and claim thy kindred skies; “Come, thy Sister Angels say, “Thou hast wept thy stains away. “Let experience now decide, “'Twixt the good, and evil tried: “In the smooth, enchanted ground, “Say, unfold the treasures found?— “Structures raised by morning dreams, “Sands that trip the flitting streams, “Down that anchors on the air, “Clouds that paint their changes there! “Seas that smoothly dimpling lie, “While the storm impends on high, “Showing, in an obvious glass, “Joys that in possession pass; “Transient, fickle, light, and gay, “Flattering, only to betray! “What, alas, can Life contain? “Life, like all it's circles, vain! “Will the stork, intending rest, “On the billow build her nest? “Will the bee demand his store “From the bleak and bladeless shore? “Man alone, intent to stray, “Ever turns from Wisdom's way; “Lays up wealth in foreign land, “Sows the sea, and plows the sand. “Soon this elemental mass, “Soon the incumbering world shall pass, “Form be wrapt in wasting fire, “Time be spent, and life expire. “Then, ye boasted works of men, “Where is your asylum then? “Sons of pleasure, sons of care, “Tell me mortals, tell me where? “Gone, like traces on the deep, “Like a scepter grasp'd in sleep, “Dews exhaled from morning glades, “Melting snows, and gliding shades! “Pass the world, and what's behind?— “Virtue's gold, by fire refined; “From an universe depraved, “From the wreck of nature saved: “Like the life-supporting grain, “Fruit of patience, and of pain, “On the swain's autumnal day, “Winnowed from the chaff away. “Little Trembler, fear no more! “Thou hast plenteous crops in store, “Seed by genial sorrows sown, “More than all thy scorners own. “What tho' hostile earth despise, “Heaven beholds with gentler eyes; “Heaven thy friendless steps shall guide, “Chear thy hours, and guard thy side. “When the fatal trump shall sound, “When the immortals pour around, “Heaven shall thy return attest, “Hail'd by myriads of the blest. “Little Native of the skies, “Lovely Penitent, arise! “Calm thy bosom, clear thy brow, “Virtue is thy sister now. “More delightful are my woes, “Than the rapture pleasure knows; “Richer far the weeds I bring, “Than the robes that grace a king. “On my wars of shortest date, “Crowns of endless triumph wait; “On my cares, a period blest; “On my toils, Eternal Rest. “Come, with Virtue at thy side, “Come, be every bar defied, “Till we gain our Native Shore: “Sister, come, and turn no more!” LOVE AND VANITY. The breezy morning breathed perfume, The wakening flowers unveil'd their bloom; Up with the sun, from short repose, Gay Health, and lusty Labour rose; The milkmaid carol'd at her pail, And shepherds whistled o'er the dale; When Love, who led a rural life, Remote from bustle, state, and strife, Forth from his thatch'd-roof'd cottage stray'd, And strolled along the dewy glade. A Nymph, who lightly trip'd it by, To quick attention turn'd his eye: He mark'd the gesture of the Fair, Her self-sufficient grace and air, Her steps that mincing meant to please, Her studied negligence and ease; And curious to enquire what meant This thing of prettiness and paint, Approaching spoke, and bow'd observant; The Lady, slightly,—“Sir, your servant.” “Such beauty in so rude a place! “Fair one, you do the country grace: “At court, no doubt, the public care— “But Love has small acquaintance there!” “Yes, sir,” replied the fluttering Dame, “This form confesses whence it came: “But dear variety, you know, “Can make us pride and pomp forego. “My name is Vanity. I sway “The utmost islands of the sea: “Within my court all honour centers, “I raise the meanest soul that enters; “Endow with latent gifts and graces, “And model fools for posts and places. “As Vanity appoints at pleasure, “The world receives its weight, and measure; “Hence all the grand concerns of life, “Joys, cares, plagues, passions, peace and strife. “Reflect how far my power prevails, “When I step in, where Nature fails, “And every breach of sense repairing, “Am bounteous still, where Heaven is sparing. “But chief, in all their arts and airs, “Their playing, painting, pouts, and prayers, “Their various habits and complexions, “Fits, frolicks, foibles, and perfections, “Their robing, curling, and adorning, “From noon 'till night, from night 'till morning, “From six to sixty, sick or sound, “I rule the Female Word around.” “Hold there a moment,” Cupid cried, “Nor boast dominion quite so wide. “Was there no province to invade, “But that by Love and Meekness sway'd? “All other empire I resign; “But be the Sphere of Beauty mine. “For in the downy lawn of rest, “That opens on a Woman's breast, “Attended by my peaceful train, “I chuse to live, and chuse to reign. “Far-sighted Faith I bring along; “And Truth, above an army strong; “And Chastity, of icy mould, “Within the burning tropics cold; “And Lowliness, to whose mild brow, “The power and pride of nations bow; “And Modesty, with downcast eye, “That lends the morn her virgin dye; “And Innocence, array'd in light; “And Honour, as a tower upright; “With sweetly winning Graces, more “Than poets ever dreamt of yore, “In unaffected conduct free, “All smiling sisters, three times three; “And rosy Peace, the cherub blest, “That nightly sings us all to rest. “Hence, from the bud of Nature's prime, “From the first step of infant time, “Woman, the world's appointed light, “Has skirted every shade with white; “Has stood for imitation high, “To every heart and every eye; “From antient deeds of fair renown, “Has brought her bright memorials down; “To Time affix'd perpetual youth, “And form'd each tale of love and truth. “Upon a new Promethean plan, “She moulds the essence of a man, “Tempers his mass, his genius fires, “And, as a better soul, inspires. “The Rude she softens, warms the Cold, “Exalts the Meek, and checks the Bold; “Calls Sloth from his supine repose; “Within the Coward's bosom glows; “Of Pride unplumes the lofty crest; “Bids bashful Merit stand confest; “And, like coarse metal from the mines, “Collects, irradiates, and refines. “The gentle science she imparts, “All manners smooths, informs all hearts: “From her sweet influence are felt, “Passions that please, and thoughts that melt; “To stormy rage she bids controul, “And sinks serenely on the soul; “Softens Deucalion's flinty race, “And tunes the warring world to peace. “Thus, arm'd to all that's light and vain, “And freed from thy fantastic chain, “She fills the sphere, by Heaven assigned, “And ruled by me, o'er-rules mankind.” He spoke. The Nymph impatient stood; And laughing, thus her speech renew'd. “And pray, sir, may I be so bold “To hope your pretty tale is told; “And next demand, without a cavil, “What new Utopia do you travel?— “Upon my word, these high flown fancies “Shew depth of learning—in romances. “Why, what unfashion'd stuff you tell us, “Of buckram dames, and tiptoe fellows! “Go, child; and when you're grown maturer, “You'll shoot your next opinion surer. “O such a pretty knack at painting! “And all for softening, and for sainting! “Guess now, who can, a single feature, “Thro' the whole piece of Female Nature! “Then mark! my looser hand may fit “The lines, too coarse for Love to hit. “'Tis said that Woman, prone to changing, “Thro' all the rounds of folly ranging, “On life's uncertain ocean riding, “No reason, rule, nor rudder guiding, “Is like the comet's wandering light, “Eccentric, ominous, and bright; “Trackless, and shifting, as the wind; “A sea, whose fathom none can find; “A moon, still changing, and revolving; “A riddle, past all human solving; “A bliss, a plague, a heaven, a hell, “A—something, that no man can tell. “Now learn a secret from a friend; “But keep your counsel, and attend. “Tho' in their tempers thought so distant, “Nor with their sex, nor selves consistent, “'Tis but the difference of a name, “And every Woman is the same. “For as the world, however varied, “And through unnumber'd changes carried, “Of elemental modes, and forms, “Clouds, meteors, colours, calms and storms, “Tho' in a thousand suits array'd, “Is of one subject matter made; “So, sir, a Woman's constitution, “The world's enigma, finds solution; “And let her form be what you will, “I am the Subject Essence still. “With the first spark of Female Sense, “The speck of being, I commence; “Within the womb make fresh advances, “And dictate future qualms and fancies; “Thence in the growing form expand, “With childhood travel hand in hand, “And give a taste of all their joys, “In gewgaws, rattles, pomp, and noise. “And now, familiar, and unaw'd, “I send the fluttering soul abroad. “Prais'd for her shape, her face, her mein, “The little goddess, and the queen, “Takes at her infant shrine oblation, “And drinks sweet draughts of adulation. “Now blooming, tall, erect, and fair, “To dress, becomes her darling care: “The realms of Beauty then I bound; “I swell the hoop's enchanted round, “Shrink in the waist's descending size, “Heaved in the snowy bosom rise, “High on the floating lappet sail, “Or curl'd in tresses kiss the gale. “Then to her glass I lead the Fair, “And shew the lovely idol there; “Where, struck as by divine emotion, “She bows with most sincere devotion; “And, numbering every beauty o'er, “In secret bids the world adore. “Then all for parking, and parading, “Coquetting, dancing, masquerading; “For balls, plays, courts, and crouds, what passion! “And churches, sometimes—if the fashion: “For Woman's sense of right, and wrong, “Is ruled by the almighty throng; “Still turns to each meander tame, “And swims the straw of every stream. “Her soul intrinsic worth rejects, “Accomplish'd only in defects; “Such excellence is her ambition; “Folly, her wisest acquisition; “And even, from pity, and disdain, “She'll cull some reason to be vain. “Thus, sir, from every form, and feature, “The wealth, and wants of female nature, “And even from vice, which you'd admire, “I gather fewel to my fire; “And, on the very base of shame, “Erect my monument of fame. “Let me another truth attempt, “Of which your Godship has not dreamt. “Those shining virtues, which you muster, “Whence think you they derive their lustre? “From native honour, and devotion?— “O yes, a mighty likely notion! “Trust me, from titled dames to spinners, “'Tis I make saints, whoe'er makes sinners; “'Tis I instruct them to withdraw, “And hold presumptuous man in awe; “For female worth, as I inspire, “In just degrees still mounts the higher, “And Virtue, so extremely nice, “Demands long toil, and mighty price: “Like Sampson's pillars, fix'd elate, “I bear the Sex's tottering state; “Sap these, and, in a moment's space, “Down sinks the fabric to its base. “Alike from titles, and from toys, “I spring, the fount of Female Joys; “In every widow, wife, and miss, “The sole artificer of bliss. “For them each tropic I explore; “I cleave the sand of every shore; “To them uniting Indias sail, “Sabæa breathes her farthest gale: “For them the bullion I refine, “Dig sense and virtue from the mine; “And from the bowels of invention, “Spin out the various arts you mention. “Nor bliss alone my powers bestow, “They hold the sovereign balm of woe: “Beyond the stoic's boasted art, “I sooth the heavings of the heart; “To pain give splendor and relief, “And gild the pallid face of grief. “Alike the palace, and the plain, “Admit the glories of my reign: “Thro' every age, in every nation, “Taste, talents, tempers, state, and station, “Whate'er a Woman says, I say; “Whate'er a Woman spends, I pay: “Alike, I fill and empty bags, “Flutter in finery and rags, “With light coquets thro' folly range, “And with the prude disdain to change. “And now you'd think, 'twixt you and I, “That things were ripe for a reply— “But soft; and, while I'm in the mood, “Kindly permit me to conclude, “Their utmost mazes to unravel, “And touch the farthest step they travel. “When every pleasure's run aground, “And folly tired thro' many a round, “The Nymph, conceiving discontent hence, “May ripen to an hour's repentance, “And vapours, shed in pious moisture, “Dismiss her to a church, or cloyster: “Then on I lead her, with devotion “Conspicuous in her dress, and motion; “Inspire the heavenly-breathing air, “Roll up the lucid eye in prayer, “Soften the voice, and in the face “Look melting harmony and grace. “Thus far extends my friendly power, “Nor quits her in her latest hour: “The couch of decent pain I spread, “In form recline her languid head, “Her thoughts I methodize in death, “And part not, with her parting breath: “Then do I set, in order bright, “A length of funeral pomp to sight, “The glittering tapers and attire, “The plumes that whiten o'er her bier; “And last, presenting to her eye “Angelic fineries on high, “To scenes of painted bliss I waft her, “And form the heaven she hopes hereafter.” “In truth,” rejoin'd Love's gentle god, “You have gone a tedious length of road: “And strange, in all the toilsome way, “No house of kind refreshment lay; “No Nymph, whose virtues might have tempted, “To hold her from her sex exempted.” “For one, we'll never quarrel, man; “Take her; and keep her,—if you can: “And pleased I yield to your petition, “Since every Fair, by such permission, “Will hold herself the one selected; “And so my system stands protected.” “O deaf to virtue, deaf to glory, “To truths divinely vouch'd in story!”— The Godhead in his zeal return'd, And kindling at her malice burn'd: Then sweetly raised his voice, and told Of Heavenly Nymphs, revered of old— Hypsipyle, who saved her sire; And Portia's love, approved by fire; Alike Penelope was quoted, Nor laurel'd Daphne past unnoted; Nor Laodamia's fatal garter, Nor famed Lucretia, honour's martyr; Alceste's voluntary steel, And Catherine smiling on the wheel! But who can hope to plant conviction, Where cavil grows on contradiction? Some she evades, or disavows; Demurs to all, and none allows— “A kind of ancient things, call'd Fables!” And thus the Goddess turn'd the tables. Now both in argument grew high, And choler flash'd from either eye; Nor wonder each refused to yield The conquest of so fair a field. When happily arrived in view A Goddess, whom our grandames knew; Of aspect grave, and sober gaite, Majestic, aweful, and sedate; As heaven's autumnal eve serene, When not a cloud o'ercasts the scene; Once Prudence call'd, a matron famed, And in old Rome Cornelia named. Quick at a venture, both agree To leave their strife to her decree. And now by each the facts were stated, In form and manner as related. The case was short. They craved opinion, “Which held o'er Females chief dominion?” When thus the Goddess, answering mild, First shook her gracious head, and smiled: “Alas, how willing to comply, “Yet how unfit a judge am I! “In times of golden date, 'tis true, “I shared the Fickle Sex with you; “But from their presence long precluded, “Or held as one whose form intruded, “Full fifty annual suns can tell, “Prudence has bid the Sex farewell.” In this dilemma what to do, Or who to think of, neither knew; For both, still biass'd in opinion, And arrogant of sole dominion, Were forced to hold the case compounded, Or leave the quarrel where they found it. When in the nick, a Rural Fair, Of inexperienced gaite and air, Who ne'er had cross'd the neighbouring lake, Nor seen the world beyond a wake, With cambrick coif, and kerchief clean, Tript lightly by them o'er the green. “Now, now!” cried Love's triumphant Child, And at approaching conquest smiled; “If Vanity will once be guided, “Our difference may be soon decided: “Behold yon Wench! a fit occasion “To try your force of gay persuasion. “Go you, while I retire aloof, “Go, put those boasted powers to proof; “And if your prevalence of art, “Transcends my yet unerring dart, “I give the favourite contest o'er, “And ne'er will boast my empire more.” At once, so said, and so consented, And well our Goddess seem'd contented; Nor pausing, made a moment's stand, But tript, and took the Girl in hand. Meanwhile the Godhead, unalarm'd, As one to each occasion arm'd, Forth from his quiver cull'd a dart, That erst had wounded many a heart; Then bending, drew it to the head— The bow-string twang'd, the arrow fled; And, to her secret soul addrest, Transfix'd the whiteness of her breast. But here the Dame, whose guardian care Had to a moment watch'd the Fair, At once her pocket mirrour drew, And held the wonder full in view; As quickly, ranged in order bright, A thousand beauties rush to sight, A world of charms till now unknown, A world revealed to her alone! Enraptured stands the Love-sick Maid, Suspended o'er the Darling Shade; Here only fixes to admire, And centers every fond desire. CONRADE: A FRAGMENT. The Song of The Filea of Antient Days, Phelin the gray-hair'd Son of the Son of Kinfadda. What do I love—what is it that mine eyes Turn round in search of—that my soul longs after, But cannot quench her thirst?—'Tis Beauty, Phelin! I see it wide beneath the arch of Heaven, When the stars peep upon their evening hour, And the moon rises on the eastern wave, Housed in a cloud of gold!—I see it wide In earth's autumnal teints of various landscape, When the first ray of morning tips the trees, And fires the distant rock!—I hear its voice, When thy hand sends the sound along the gale, Swept from the silver strings; or, on mine ear Drops the sweet sadness!—At my heart I feel Its potent grasp, I melt beneath the touch, When the tale pours upon my sense humane The woes of other times!—What art thou, Beauty? Thou art not colour, fancy, sound, nor form— These but the conduits are, whence the soul quaffs The liquor of its Heaven.—Whate'er thou art, Nature, or Nature's Spirit, thou art All I long for!—O, descend upon my Thoughts! To thine own music, tune, thou Power of Grace, The cordage of my heart! fill every shape That rises to my dream, or wakes to vision; And touch the threads of every mental nerve, With all thy sacred feelings!— THE SUN now hasten'd down his western Heaven, And saw his beams reflected from the spires Of fair Emania.—High, within the Hall, With all his Heroes, names of wide renown, With all his Sages, heads grown white in council, With all his Bards, the sires of song, around him— Conrade the mighty, sate! Wide o'er the festal board, in many a bowl, The various liquor flow'd.—In various cups, Metal, or wrought from veiny adamant, Or of the treasures of the pearly deep, The social pledge of health went round. Before The King of Chiefs, the hoar and reverend brow Of Wisdom was unbent, and every heart Caught gladness from his aspect. Near the seat Of lifted Majesty, stood the young bloom Of Erin's hope, Slemfannon, as a sapling Sprouting aloft beneath the parent oak, That overlooks the forest. Now, and oft, He turn'd his face of filial sweetness upward, To catch the glance of the paternal eye, That dropt indulgence and delight upon him: Now, with both hands, fast by the sinewy wrist, He grasp'd the First of Heroes—“O,” he cried, “Will ever, ever, your Slemfannon wield “The crashing mace, or bend the bow of steel, “With such an arm as this?”—He spoke, and rear'd The ponderous hand on high! The shout of joy Pour'd round the table!—for, in that right hand, Lay Erin's glory, and the sure resource Of nations from the wasters of the world! Soft smiling, gently bending from his seat, The Monarch answer'd—“Yes, thou pride of Conrade, “In whom he fondly joys to live renew'd, “Fresh born, a dearer growth of young existence— “Thou art the vessel that shall pour his fame “On future times!—The day is yet to come, “When nations, to exalt the name of Conrade, “Shall say, He was the Father of Slemfannon!” “Thine arm is young, my son, but not inglorious; “The Romans, from the Rhodane to the Po, “Have felt it through their steel! The ear of heroes “Lists not to its own praise—yet know, thy name “Is in the song of bards; and Phelin, oft, “To me gives up the music of thy deeds, “And tunes my soul to joy.—But, mark, Slemfannon! “The arm of Power is, ever, worthiest seen “In Preservation—he, who saves, is next “To him who gives existence. O, Slemfannon, “That we might save!—that we might save All, then, “Without offence to Any! In this Hall, “O, might yon length of sword, yon shining mail, “Hang indolent for ever!—and, in days “Of ages yet to come, the Sons of Peace, “Gazing and wondering, question, with each other, “What once had been their use!—Attend, my heroes!— “Man comes into this passing world of weakness, “And cries for help to man! for, feeble is he, “And many are his foes—thirst, hunger, nakedness; “Diseases infinite within his frame; “Without, the inclemency and wrath of seasons, “Famines, plagues, pests, devouring elements, “Earthquakes beneath, and thunders rolling o'er him; “Age and infirmity, on either hand; “And Death who, lifts the certain Dart behind him! “These we might deem (had any Pitying Power “Ordain'd the ways of man) were ills sufficient! “Man thinks not so—on his own race he turns “The force of all his talents, exquisite “To shorten the short interval, by Art, “Which Nature left us! Fire and sword are in “His hand; and, in his thought, are machinations “For speeding of perdition! Half the world, “Down the steep gulph of dark futurity, “Push off their fellows—pause upon the brink— “And then drop after!”— “Tell me, ye Sages, tell me, if ye can, “Whence is the Stream of Life!—It rises fresh “In smiling infancy; and pours along, “Short, turbulent, and murmuring in its course, “To its capacious sea. The sea fills not; “The sea, from whence it never has return'd; “Nor ceases, yet, the stream.—Where lies the Fund, “From whence it flows?—will it be ever, thus?— “And to no end, no purpose?”— While, thus, the Hero question'd on the height And depth of vast Infinitude, intent To plumb it with his fathom; through the Hall A sudden Radiance broke!—All turn'd their eyes Upon the coming Glory; for, of earth, They did not deem the vision!—On she came, Shulama, daughter of the gold-throned king Of Scandinavia—on she came, in all Her pleasantness of beauty, as the morn, Blushing amidst the brightness of its east, Rises on human sight! A train of virgins Follow'd her steps; to them, twice twenty heroes, Lords of wide lands and famed in northern fields, Succeeded; and yet, distant, far behind, Was seen the long retinue! Through the Hall, Silent and still, as in the noon of night, Attention held its breath—the white hair'd Sages Rear'd their spread hands, in wonder—and Slemfannon Gazed, as a blind-born man endow'd with sight, When first he looks upon a new found world! Tow'rd the gem'd throne of awful majesty, The Maiden bent the lustre of her eye, And grace of motion. Lowly, on her knee She sunk, imploring—“Hail, thou First of Heroes, “The conqueror of the conquerors of the world, “King over kings uplifted!—Have I then, “Beheld the face of Conrade, and survived it?” “Ruthamor, monarch of the golden throne, “Whose deeds light up the north, hath sent Shulama “To seek alliance with the might of Conrade!— “I come from far, ambassadress of love; “And claim a partner for my father's throne, “Even your beloved daughter, Segaleme, “The witch who rolls the eyes of young enchantment!” Rising, and slow descending from his throne, Conrade advanced. He rais'd the awe-struck maid, And, to his war-imprinted bosom, clasp'd The dangers of her beauty—“Welcome, welcome, “Welcome,” he cried, “to Conrade, to his Erin, “Thou daughter of delight!—for favouring Heaven “Hath made thee in its pride of workmanship, “And planted loveliness, as light, around thee! “Hadst thou, O daughter of the blest Ruthamor, “Required a province at the hands of Conrade, “It had been given—or gold, and costly jewels; “He would have stored your shipping with the burden, “Till you cried, Hold!—But, here, alas, you ask “The only thing I covet!—Segaleme, “And young Slamfannon, are the eyes of Conrade— “The precious eyes, by which he guides his steps, “And looks, alone, for joy! And shall I, then, “Shall I send off the treasure from my soul, “To enrich the land of strangers?—No, Shulama! “Haply, when grown infirm, and dim with age, “When I can only feel around for comfort, “How shall my hands stretch forth to foreign climes, “And, to my knees, draw up the little ones “Of Segaleme?”—While the Monarch spoke, A distant portal open'd: Segaleme Appear'd to sight, and fill'd the pass with brightness! As, should two moons, at east and west, arise In aspect opposite; and each, in other, Behold the image of its own perfection; So shone, so moved, so gazed, the Rival Lights Of Conrade and Ruthamor! They approach'd— Their steps seem'd measured by the sound of music; And each had lost the memory of herself, In admiration of the other's beauty! Silent, their arms of ivory they expand; They fold each other to a polish'd bosom, And mix their rays of brightness!—Segaleme First broke the stillness in the Hall of Heroes. “Welcome,” she cried, “thrice welcome to the vale “Of Erin, that shall gladden in thy presence, “O Beam of northern hills!”—“And have I, then, “Have I, at length, beheld thee,” cried Shulama, “Thou praise of every tongue?—mine eyes are satisfied, “And take their rest with thee!”—“Thou art the joy, “The sister of my soul!” said Segaleme— She spoke, and kiss'd her forehead.—Whispering soft, Shulama then inquired—“Say, which is he, “The force of your Slemfannon, so renown'd “For feats of warfare in the field of Romans? “Which is your mighty brother, Segaleme?— “For mine eye dare not venture in his search, “Amid the groups of Heroes that surround us.” “There, there he grows, the flower of Erin's garden, “Fast by the royal pillar of the land!— “There stands the young Slemfannon, in his sweetness!” Full on the youth, the Maid of Scandinavia Roll'd the young lightning of the glance of beauty— His eyes met hers; and down they sunk abash'd, As caught in some transgression.— “Ah, thou deceiver, beauteous witch of Erin,” Rejoin'd Shulama, “this is not thy brother!— “I ween'd to meet some giant, as in tales “Of old renown, and terrible to sight! “But here, I view the Infant of the Spring, “Like one of us, who pale to look on blood, “And, o'er the dying songster of the cage, “Shed tears of mourning!”—Segaleme smiled; And from the dimpling of her radiant cheek A glory went abroad!—Forth, by the hand, She led the lovely Stranger to her bower. Mean-season, to the Peers of Scandinavia The Monarch bow'd benevolent, and said— “Welcome, ye Heroes of the sky-topt hills! “Thrice welcome all, though each had been an hundred— “For Plenty dwells upon the vales of Erin, “And Conrade's palace is the Home of Strangers! “The night descends—light up my many halls; “Spread wide the boards; pour plenteous, to the brim, “The juice of every region!”—It was done. By hundreds, and by fifties, sat the Chiefs Commix'd with Bards and Sages; while the voice Of festal joy was heard throughout Emania. But, far within, in regal majesty, Sat Erin's Strength! Slemfannon blest his side; And, full in view, he placed the high-born maids, And fed his soul upon the work of Beauty. Phelin, the seer and song of antient days, The sage instructor of his loved Slemfannon, Was seated here—and here, again, Siffrenna, The white hair'd guardian of Shulama's beauties. Soon as the board lay lighten'd of the banquet, Fair boys and maidens, into chrystal cups, Pour'd the rich vintage of the Greekish isles Of Archipelago. The joy went round; The wish of pleasing, and the sweets of converse! “Slemfannon,” said the Monarch, “take the harp— “Thou arm of Conrade, take the strings of story, “And, to the ear of Erin's lovely Guest, “Tune some of thine adventures, when thou stood'st, “In southern climates, by the side of Conrade, “Then, like a glimpse of lightning, shot abroad, “And overturn'd the foe!”—Yet still obedient To the high call, the blushing Youth replied: “I turn'd, and shelter'd me behind your buckler, “As though behind the walls of Arisphellan!” Old Phelin from its chain releas'd the lyre, And gave it, smiling.—O'er the silver strings Light flew the fingers of the shamefaced Boy, Scarce audible.—At length the tale began: Our tent was pitch'd amid the field of Narbon— The dead lay wide around—the night came down, To veil their ghastliness—no star appear'd— And the moon, sickening at the sight of blood, Had shrowded up her visage!—Through the gloom, Mine ear was stricken with the voice of wailing, Sad as a thousand sighs, when the dark winds Sob through the yews that stand amid the graves Of Arnel!—Forth I went to seek the mourner. Through the night's glimpse, that struck upon his mail, I saw a warrior, tall and fair of stature. Upon his strenuous arm, he, lightly, bore The corse of his companion. On a bank He laid the body down, and sunk beside it. “Art thou then gone,” he cried? “for ever gone, “Companion of my soul! in whom I lived, “The dearer self of desolated Hugon! “Wilt thou no more arise, like light, upon me? “Nor give the smile of friendship to mine eyes? “Nor cheer my spirit with thy voice of music? “Why didst thou step before me in the battle? “Wast thou not safe, behind my wheeling sword, “As in the fort of Delma?—That my breast, “O, that my naked breast had met the dart, “That slew my brother!—Thou hast left me; Berith, “With Grief, alone, companion'd.—O, stern Grief, “Sad is thy fellowship! I will not bide it.— “I will o'ertake thee, Berith!—We will live; “Perchance, in happier climes; or, in one grave, “Silent lie down, and sleep in peace together! “Look not, my mother, from the wonted pride “Of thine high battlements, to see thy son “Returning, in the front of all his trophies!— “Mistake not Arden's forest for his flags; “Nor the wind's western clangor for his trumpets!— “Thou shalt look upward, with a tearful eye, “And sigh to see, how empty is his armour!— “Thy hall, it shall be hung around with black, “And one lone lamp shall light thee!” Straight, by the accent of the Hero's tongue, I knew him for an enemy to Conrade: But well I knew, that Conrade was the friend Of humankind!—With gentle voice, the voice, As of a brother, I the Chief accosted: “My heart, O Warrior! takes a kindred share “In all thy sufferings.—In the field, indeed, “My faulchion rises in my country's quarrel; “But my soul knows no warfare with the Brave, “The Good, or the Unhappy!—Know, great Hugon, “That the Distress'd are held as Sons and Brothers “To Conrade and Slemfannon! Near at hand, “Extends our camp—whate'er of friendly aid “Can there be given, is thine!” He answer'd not; But, with a grateful and assenting clasp, Confined me to his bosom—while our souls, Mingling their friendships, coalesced together. Attendants straight I call'd; then to my tent Convey'd the corse, and gently on a bed Reclined, and soon the steely mail unbraced— When, strange to tell! upon the astonish'd sight Rose two twin orbs of beauty!—Back, abash'd, Starting I turn'd, and sent the female-train; Then sought where Hugon, all involv'd in grief, Sat with my Sire. In panting haste I told The wondrous tale.—The Hero cried, “'Tis she, “'Tis she herself!—it must be Eliphene!— “My heart confess'd her, though my eyes refused “Its attestation, turning Love's fierce ardours “To Friendship's gentler flame!”—At once they rose, And follow'd, where the beauteous body lay, Decent, in virgin sheets.—We sent in haste, And call'd Elphenor, sovereign of all herbs And arts for healing—He the deadly wound E'er long discovered; for it still oozed crimson, Like a rose springing midst a bed of lilies! The vital heat, unwilling to forego Its lovely mansion, feebly held the center; And still a thread of life gave faint pulsation! From his elixir'd chrystal, drop by drop, Thro' the pale lips, the cautious Sage infused The potent cordial.—Thus, while doubtful life Hung, fearfully suspended, generous Hugon Address'd my Sire— O Conrade, cried the Chief, Thou Dread of Tyrants; hateful to Oppressors, But, to the Feeble and Oppress'd, a name Of sure Asylum—loved of all the Valiant!— Yes, Hugon swears the Valiant love thee, Conrade, Even while, as foes, they draw the sword against thee!— O Monarch, lend the ear of thy compassion; Thine ear, still open to the tale of mourning, Lend it a while to Hugon!—He's a Tuscan, By clime and birth thine enemy—although His kindred spirit long has held the dear, Even with the dearest.—Hear then, hear my tale Of sad distress!—That lovely, hapless Maid, Of noblest lineage, to my guardian care, Was by her parents left.—She was addrest By all the potentates, whose station warranted To lift an eye so lofty.—I was, then, In foreign climes, on travel—I return'd. Upon a stated festival, the chiefs And princes of the land, with princely dames, Convened, a galaxy!—I too was there; And there was Eliphene, as the star Of beauty, regent, midst the smaller sparklers! With fond attraction she compell'd me to her, As the touch'd needle to the frozen north; For so I did misdeem it.—From that day, Amidst the noblest of her princely suitors, I too preferr'd my claim.—She first receiv'd me With smiling, kind, encouraging complacence: But soon her looks grew more constrain'd—whene'er Her eyes met mine, she blush'd and turn'd aside, As wishing to avoid me.—To all others, She look'd an elegance of ease, and spoke In terms as free as air—to me, her speech, Unfrequent, was abrupt and cautious.—Stung With scorpion'd jealousy, I, to my soul, Thus spoke indignant—“What have these to boast, “These favour'd rivals, o'er rejected Hugon! “Does their pre-eminence consist in shape, “Or feature?—eyes, that are not Eliphene's, “Will answer, No.—And, as to feats of prowess, “Compared with me, they're nameless!—O shame, shame, “Shame on this weakness, this degrading passion! “Henceforth, I will wage war on my own heart— “And conquer it, or perish!” At the time, The tidings of your dread invasion reach'd us. Quick, at the name of Conrade, my whole soul Kindled to generous rivalship—“Yes, yes, “Thou shalt be met, thou mighty one!” I cried, “Thou shalt be met—thy best esteemer shall “Oppose thee, front to front!—I ask of Heaven “No boon, no other bounty, than to have “My death ennobled by the arm of Conrade!” Straight I address'd for war; but Love, uncall'd, Obtruded, whispering to my secret soul, “First take thy last adieu of Eliphene!” Pride, haughty champion, rose, with stern rebuke Against the gentler Power. He frown'd, and cried, “What, are we not, as yet, enough debased?— “Shall we add further forces to the foe; “And furnish arms, against our nobleness, “To the tried scorn and insolence of Beauty?” Dire was the contest—Love long kept his ground; But Pride, at last, was prevalent—I rent, I tore myself away from my Beloved, From my true Lover— As a self-murderer, desperate of his state, Makes a divorce betwixt his soul and body! I lay encamp'd, my legions tented round me, When word was brought me of a youthful warrior, Of graceful mein, and more than matchless beauty, Who ask'd admission.—To my presence led He bow'd submiss; and, blushing, pray'd the grace Of being privileged to do me service. My heart straight took acquaintance with his aspect— Some strange similitude fond memory found 'Twixt him and Eliphene!—but, my soul Conceiv'd no thought, that she her tender frame Should vest in steel—should seek the man she hated— Should trace her Hugon into death and dangers! Instant, our hearts commenced a friendship, tender, Fondly inviolate, as caught together By hooks of golden grappling.—I, no more, Sought Conrade on the perilous edge of conflict; I now had one to care for! and my eye, My guardian eye pursued and watch'd his motions, On this side, and on that.—In this day's battle, I charged him, on his duty, on his love, To hold him rearward.—Still I turn'd, and turn'd, Even as a timid deer accompanied By her loved fawn, to see if he was near— But yet, alas, in fear of losing fame, I led my Friend too deeply into dangers! At length, toward eve—for who can cope with Conrade?— Your host prevail'd!—Indignant I opposed, And would have reinforced the fight—when, lo, A random shaft rush'd, rudely, through the mail, The light framed mail of my beloved Companion, And ting'd his arms with blood! Upon the instant, Our legions sounded a retreat. Then, then— Must I confess that Hugon trembled?—Straight Into my arms I caught my best beloved, And fled the hindmost: night came on apace, And parted all affray—Upon a bank I laid her down, and, to the pitying moon, Whose doubtful glimpses thro' the darkness broke, Utter'd my wailings.—Then, our loved Slemfannon Came, provident of comforts, to console; And did console, by shewing, that, on earth, Such Virtue still was extant!—Here, the Hero Closed his sad narrative! Meantime, Elphenor, pendent o'er the corse, Still plied his tender offices. At length, The beauteous Form began to move—each heart Bounded with expectation—when her eyes Open'd their faint refulgence to the light, Look'd wild around her with a sickly gleam, And closed their orbs for ever!—Then Elphenor: “By death's cold hand this Rose of Beauty cropt, “Fades, and shall bloom no more—except in Heaven!” Meantime astonish'd, o'er the lifeless corse, The Hero speechless stood—then, all at once, As some high cliff, far jutting o'er its base, Disparts and dashes on the sea-beat shore, Bereft of sense he fell—bless'd pause of being! But O, how fearfully to be succeeded By anguishings unutterable!—Long, Long lay he tranced—I thought, I wish'd him dead— For what had life, midst all its stores of bliss, For him, save misery extreme?—At length, He waked to all the pangs of mental feeling! Five days, and five soul-torturing nights, he lay By the embalm'd Remains—in all which time, Nor food, nor word of utterance, past his lips; Nor word of consolation to his ear Obtain'd admission—By his side fast laid, I press'd his hand in mine, and on it dropt The tear of sad condolence! Through the camp, Sudden I heard the shout of joint laments— I rose, and issued forth.— FINIS.</field>
