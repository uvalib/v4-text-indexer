      <field name="fulltext">PART I. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. THE TRADITION OF THE GOLDEN SPURS. Listen to me,â I heard a story once, a legend old, Calmly and simply told By a young child; who, if her words might be Fraught with past sighs and mournful imagery, Knew not the touching nature of her tale, Nor felt her young heart failâ Recounting troubles she could nothing know, With ancient battles almost out of mind, Warriors on History's page but half defin'd, And Saxon times, and manners left behind, Ages ago. Listen to me,â There is a little river, fed by rills, That winds among the hills, And turns and suns itself unceasingly, And wanders through the corn-fields wooingly, For it has nothing else to do but play Along its cheery way; Not like great rivers that in locks are bound, On whom hard man doth heavy burdens lay, And fret their waters into foam and spray. This river's life is one long holiday All the year round. Listen and long!â It hears the bells of many churches chime, It has a pleasant time: The trees that bow to it their branches strong, Hide many birds that make its spring one song, And orchard boughs let fall their flowery wealth, To float away by stealth, And land in tiny coves a mile below, Or round and round the stems of rushes veer Like snowy foam, but truly none is here, So calmly gurgle on the waters clear With endless flow. What means this boat? And why across the stream as smooth as glass So calmly does it pass? There is a weighty reason, one of note, And all the country knows it well by rote; I saw, this morning, by the river's side, A fair and blue-ey'd bride; She pass'd the bridge nor turn'd her foot that way, Though in her path towards the church it stood; She came across the fields, and through the wood, And by the ferry boat her way made good, This very day. Now the stream sings Through the wide common, gay with furze and broom, Sweet musk, and heather bloom; Through pastures white with fieldfare's fluttering wings, Freckled with fern, and dropp'd with fairy rings; Prattling, and telling ever, night and day, To all that pass that way The self-same tale that it has always done. What then? the tale, if ancient, is most true, Sure as the steadfast hills; why vainly sue For that which is not? âThere is nothing new Under the sun.â No more of this,â I cannot bind its murmurs in my line, And into words confine The story of its wanderings and its bliss, Nor tell how its sweet waves the margin kiss; Through the grey walls of the old Saxon town Let it come gently down, Let it come dancing brightly into view From under the old bridge, and gurgling swell Past the green bed of reeds where Edmund fell; The Saxon Prince, of whom this tale they tell, I tell to you. The heathen Dane was in the land, he spread his tokens wide, Like running fire on moorlands dry he swept the country side; The south fled down before his face, he left the north forlorn, He tore the bridges from their banks, and burn'd the standing corn. The herbs were green before his face, they waver'd in the wind, But with his foot he drank their lives, and left them black behind. As if his breath was poison's seed, his curse had blasting power, The grass along his pathway droop'd, and wither'd bud and flower. Like troops of demons from beneath, let loose awhile from chains, His thousands swarm'd upon the strand, and spread upon the plains. Upon a quiet Sabbath morn, they reach'd our fenny shore, And they that rang the church bells then, did never ring them more. They came across yon dewy slope, where scatter'd alders grow, And there a bloody field was fought, that long, long time ago. The summer sun arose betimes on murder, din, and rout, And setting late, was all too soon to see that battle out. It was upon the longest day the Danes and Saxons met, And echoes as of clashing swords, 'tis said, are heard here yet; Heard often on a summer noon, when all the land is still, With passing footsteps on the grass, and whispers from the hill. There lie, shut out from light and change, crush'd in their crowded beds, With spear and lance corroded deep and rusted arrow heads,â There lie the bones of those who fell, where now with heedless feet Upon the barrow on the hill the rustic lovers meet. It was upon the longest day (as learned men divine), And ere the sun was fairly down, the moon began to shine, She cast abroad her waxen rays, and was a lovely sight, So pale she look'd while all the west with ruddy red was bright. She shone without a cloud to shade her wan reproachful face, Till, near her time of going down, the sky grew black apace: Up from the south came driving mists, and fast before her fled, Heavy and black, as evil dreams about a murderer's bed. Then many a soul in darkness deep pass'd upward from the plain, And many a curse on his false gods pour'd forth the heathen Dane; And many a sigh from Saxon lips was breath'd for coming day, Breath'd vainlyâas the life-blood fail'd, that ebb'd so fast away. Where was the Saxon Prince that night? his scatter'd force had fled; But he was not with themânor laid at rest among the deadâ The little river in his ears had sung that night, to guide His footsteps to the bridge that spann'd its broad but shallow tide. The bridge was wider than the stream, and on its western bank, Beneath the arch, a bed of reeds and sedge and rushes dank, And waterflags in thick array and broad-leav'd mallows grew, As still along the water's edge in that same place they do. There did he rest his wearied head, and bathe his stiffen'd hands, While, closely all around, the reeds uprear'd their sheltering bands: There, spent with toil, his eyelids dropt in darkness blank and dun, Till through the guardian sedges peer'd the soon returning sun. Among the yellow flags declin'd, he sank into a dream, Again beheld his castle burn, and heard his infants screamâ Saw at their mother's breast the sword, and heard her heart-sick cryâ Awokeâthe river's face was sweet, and red the cloudy sky. Stirr'd in the morning air, the reeds bent down and touch'd his brow, A sweet and silent welcoming to his lone spirit now; A tree beside the bridge uprose, a crimson-tassel'd larch, And past him flow'd with silver feet the river through the arch. O sweetly talk'd the river then, as if an angel sung, And whisper'd to the tassel'd larch that near its margin hung; And softly spoke the morning breeze, that lightly rais'd his hair, As if to seek the golden crown, which was no longer there. It came in dreamy, dreamy tones, half trouble, half surprise, It mourn'd his lot, but mourning soothed with its long-heaving sighs: It question'd much, and answer'd not to its own doubts and fears, But shook the reeds, till on his head they dropt their morning tears. âWhere was it gone that golden crown?â (the sweet voice seem'd to say) âThe Dane would wear it ne'er so well, nor with so mild a sway; Why had yon shadowing larch grown old, nourish'd with sun and dew, While human blessings prov'd so frail, so fleeting, and so few? âRivers of water took their course between the self-same hills, And knew no change from age to age, nor touch of human ills. But change was come to him,â it sigh'd, as still with mournful tone It question'd with the Saxon Prince reclining there alone. âWhere were they now, his fair-hair'd boys?â (in whispers faint it sigh'd With soft complainings at his feet, diffus'd upon the tide.) âThe river's life was better far, that long ago began, More to be envied than the fate reserv'd for mortal man.â Ah! then, the river found a voice, and for herself she spoke; In liquid cadences her song the morning silence broke, Divided with soft murmurs fraught, with comfort came the lay, Condoling tones, of pity born, and thus she seem'd to sayâ âListen to me,â My waters in the upland pastures rise, Fed by the earth and skies; Thence tend and set to the wide-flowing sea; And not a hill that lies Along my course but seeth her green sides, Far down my glassy tides. Oh, longâaye, long, these scatter'd trees have stood, And long this stretching wood.â But I was old Ere they did first their budding germs unfold, Or the green acorns fell, That into their great parent oaks did swell. I was a river when the earth was young, And from my source I sprung, And danc'd with joyous cadence, clear and strong, My lonely paths along; Sweet melodies I sung Ere there was ear of man to hearken to my song. âOn my untrodden brink From age to age the willows lean'd to drink; Thick forests grew, the upland tracks to crown, And crept like sunbeams down, Through lapse of moving centuries gone by, To me drawn slowly nigh! I was a river then, and things from far Conspir'd to give me beauty; clouds as white As wings of swans across me took their flight. I wore the image of the morning star Upon my bosom! Yet to thee I sing Of change and desolationâTime shall bring A day of doom, a last, a closing strain To all my musicâhear it once again, That, like a bird, must soon or late take wing, O Saxon King! âListen to me! There is a riverââ (Oh, how soothing sad A voice its murmurs had!) There is a river, sighing tenderly, The âstreams whereof make glad The city of our God.â Though spring-tide rain, Though early dews, no longer should maintain The rivers of this world; E'en though great mountains from their places hurl'd, Should fall, uprooted, in the boiling sea, And earth be mov'd from her stabilityâ There is a river that on high doth flow, Nor ebb nor changing know. There is a tree, that of its wave receives, Yielding twelve manner of immortal fruitsâ The tree of life, whose leaves Are for the healing of the nationsâlo! She spreadeth forth her roots, And by that river's margin she doth grow, And long shall grow when I have ceas'd to sing, O Saxon King! âWoe unto thee! The crown of gold is fallen from thy head; And all thy hopes lie low with the unburied dead! Woe to the landâ (it pin'd) âand woe to me!â In murmur'd tones, Long sobs, and dirge-like moans, Lost in the rustling of the wavy sedge Crowding its dimpled edge. After a while, returning to his ear With more of comfort in its plaintive cheer, It tried a closing strain, And told of that sweet river once againâ Of infant spirits, blissful dwellers there, Amid pavilions fair. Then sigh'd, âLament no more Thy weary sojourn on my lonely shore! When I, with all my waves shall cease to be, And lose my waters in the whelming sea, Thy soul with comfort fraught Shall grieve no more for aught Of all her bitterness, of all her care! There is a river by whose margins fair, Thou shalt remember me, And this, thy day of grief, where grief no more may be!â Then, bubbling on her way, She seem'd to tell of some not distant day, Some bright hereafter hailing, When, blest inheritor of joy unfailing, Upon his head should rest Another crown of gold; Where guardian angels their bright wings unfold In crystal streets, on hallow'd errands blest; Where, to and fro, The mission'd spirits go â Dwellers in light on the immortal shore, And from the throne celestial waters flow For evermore! So talk'd she on that far-off day, while reeds were rustling nigh, And told her story to a heart too weary for reply; Too utterly with grief bow'd down, too sorely press'd with care, To think it other than a dream, or heed, if such it were. The morning ripen'd into noon, while there conceal'd he slept, While Danish scouts the country rode, and Saxon mothers wept; They sought, but breeding swallows knew, and mark'd the reedy place, And, from their nests beneath the arch, they watch'd his silent face. Before the dew began to fall, about the turn of day, The careless herd-boy led his kine, upon their homeward way. He brought them to the water's edge, where stooping down to drink With large meek eyes they saw the king, and started from the brink. They saw, though dull of ear and eye the herd-boy might not know: âBack, back,â he cried, and back they turn'd, with cautions steps and slow. And never from those gazing eyes one moment took their own, But peer'd at him, that lay as still, and silent as a stone. Upon the ridge of yonder hill, which heaves toward the sky, Two storm-struck elms their wither'd arms held stiffly up on high. Between them dipp'd the blood-red sun, and gaz'd upon the stream, 'Till, like a flood of molten ore, she glow'd beneath his beam. And the moon rose from her repose, as pale as pale could be, Just where the river rounds the hill, behind the church came she. Adown its length she dropp'd her light, a winding wavering ray, Bright, âas the pathway of the just,â that shines â'till perfect day.â The land was silent as the moon, and peaceful as her light; A headlong stream far westward roll'd, the current of the fight. Beneath the bridge the Saxon Prince beheld the fading West, And saw the last returning bird descend into her nest. Softly! the sleeping echoes, rous'd on pasture, wood, and lea, Repeating, sent along the stream clear notes of mirth and glee. Along the river's winding brink the bridegroom at her side, In the moonlight, on palfrey white, rode down a silent bride. With joyance meet, and music sweet, her Danish followers came, And laudits shower'd on her blue eyes, the young and fair-hair'd dame. With veil thrown back, and bridle slack, along the river's side, Oft glancing at her Danish lord, she rode, the Saxon bride. Towards the bridge, this ancient bridge, where sleeps the moonlight now, She came, with music in her train and jewels on her brow; While, glittering on the river's breast, the stars like diamonds lay; Among the sedge, at its green edge, she took her homeward way. All beautiful with silv'ry light the bride drew in the rein, Across, into the bed of reeds, she gaz'd, and gaz'd again,â And suddenly, the maiden blush died out from her fair cheek, Her flashing eyes forgot full soon their glances soft and meek! A face,âa form, one instant seen, had wrought that potent spell; Ah, treachery! Alas, she knew that silent face too wellâ âMethinks upon the river's brink, that somewhat gleams and stirs, Methinks I see beneath the arch, the flash of golden spurs.â A start, â a cry, â the crash of swords, the warcry of the Dane; The heathen warriors bound his hands with that white palfrey's rein. Upon his brow, so stern and pale, the gentle moonlight play'd; He stood erect upon the bridge, the man she had betray'd. Bound and begirt with glittering spears, 'twas but a moment's space, He turn'd him to the Saxon bride, and look'd her in the face; And Danish lord, and Danish slave, fell back with muttering tone; The bridegroom started from her side, and left her there alone. And there was silence on the bridge, a deep pause and a longâ Alone she stood, her fair lips clos'd, mute as her marriage song. Alone, unveil'd, till, surely aim'd, came from the river's side An arrow from a Danish bow, and struck the Saxon bride. Lament, O river! and be sad; her face was fair and sweet; Before the king she bow'd her head, and perish'd at his feet! Lament; for near thee lingers yet his memory, not in vain; A witness grey to that night's work, the bridge doth still remain. Fast, headlong, as returning tides, that sweep some rocky strand, With heathen yells and savage cries rush'd back the murderous band; And bridal weeds and marriage veil, down trampling, fiercely sped, And rear'd the battle-axe on high above the Saxon's head. âNow curse,â they cried, âthis new, new name, whereon thy people call: Else, by the rites of Odin's cave! thou this same night shalt fall. Or let thy new god shield thee from the old gods if he will.â But he stood firm upon the bridge,âunheeding, cold, and still. Against these time-worn stones he lean'd, when back his captors cameâ There scorn'd the life that must be bought by loss of Christian name. Tempted;âbut what were life, and land, and proffer'd crown to him? The murderous fire, o'er wife and child, had scarcely yet grown dim! O Martyr blest! Confessor firm! true to thy meed of light! 'Mid savage taunts and heathen cries âthy lamp went out by night.â Merged is thy realm, thy nation changed, that still reveres thee dead, And cherishes the latest words that Saxon Edmund said. Upon the bridge he struck his hand, tradition keeps the tale, Prophetic warning strange he gave ere fleeting life did fail. âWoe worth the maid, whose marriage train by thee shall cross the tide,â Ill fare the foot, by thee to pass, of bridegroom or of bride!â . . . . Grey arch, bedeck'd with mosses fair, the swallows crowd thine eaves; And homage from the constant sun thine aged front receives; The moon adorns thee thereâthe wind plays hollow music sweet; And wantons in the feathery reeds, that flourish at thy feet. To thee the market girl comes down, with basket on her arm, By thee, with thoughtful face, returns the matron to the farm; A tinkling sweet, beneath his feet, the blind old beggar hears; The school-boy with his satchel leans, half dreaming on thy piers. Across the bridge, in gay attire, to fair or statute bound, The rustic people fearless pass, from all the country round. Across the bridge, in sable clad, comes on the funeral train; When evening, like a mourner, dons her own dark suit again. Across the bridge, grown old and hoar, since that far-distant day, Hath nothing pass'd that spell to break, to bear that charm away; And still it spans the silvery flood, for all the vale beside, But never since, hath known the foot of Bridegroom or of Bride! Note. About the year 870, the Danes under Hingvar invaded East Anglia, which was then governed by Edmund, a king of singular virtue and piety. After defending his people with great valour, Edmund was at last defeated in a battle fought near Hoxne in Suffolk. Being hotly pursued, he concealed himself under a bridge called Gold-bridge. The glittering of his golden spurs discovered him to a newly-married couple who were returning home by moonlight, and the bride betrayed him to his enemies. The heathen Danes offered him his crown and his life if he would deny the Christian faith; but he continued steadfast, and when he was dragged on to the bridge, he pronounced a malediction (or warning) on all who should afterwards pass over it on their way to be married: the dread of which is still so strong in the neighbourhood, that it is said no bride or bridegroom has ever been known to pass over it to this day. THE TWO MARGARETS. No. I.âMARGARET IN THE XEBEC. âNow, concerning this man (Robert del Angelo) little further is known, than that he served in the King's army, and was wounded in the battle of Marston Moor. âAfter the battle of Naseby, finding himself a marked man, he quitted the country, taking with him the child whom he had adopted, she being then about three years of age; and he made many voyages between the different parts of the Mediterranean and Levant.â Resting within his tent at close of day A wailing voice his scanty sleep beset: He started upâit did not flee awayâ 'Twas no part of his dream, but still did fret And pine into his heart âAh meâah me!â Broken with heaving sobs most mournfully. Then he arose, and greatly wondering, All wearily towards the sound he went, Much doubting whence those grieving sobs might spring,â Shortly he came before a soldier's tent, Where, the tears falling through her hands, he found A little maiden weeping on the ground. And backward in the tent, an aged crone Upbraided her unkindly more and more, But sunk her chiding to an undertone When she beheld who stood before the door, And calm'd her voice, and dropp'd her lifted hand, And answer'd him with accent soft and bland. No, the young child was none of hers, she said, But she had found her near the ashes white Of a yet smouldering tent, her infant head All shelterless, she through the dewy night Had slumber'd on the fieldâungentle fate For a lone child, so soft and delicate! âAnd I,â quoth she, âhave tended her with care, And thought to be rewarded of her kin, For by her rich attire and features fair I know her birth is gentle; yet within The tent unclaim'd she rests, to pine and weep, A burden I would fain no longer keep.â Still, while she spoke the little creature wept; Till yearning pity touch'd him for the flow Of those sad tears, and to his heart there crept A wish to have her for his own, and so He, his kind arms outstretching tenderly SaidââLittle Madam, wilt thou come with me?â Then she left off her crying, and a look Of doubtful wonder stole into her eyes; The sullen frown her dimpled face forsook; She let him take her, and forgot her sighs, Contented in the stranger's arms to rest, And lay her baby head upon his breast. And thus he took her for his own, and brought Into his tent the orphan to remain; But surely stranger plaything ne'er was sought By roving bachelor on battle-plain Than his, the prattling child that on the floor Play'd at his feet within the tented door. Of race, of country, or of parentage, Her lisping accents nothing could unfold;â No questioning could win to read the page Of her short lifeâshe left her tale untold, And home and kin thus early to forget, She only knew,âher name wasâMargaret. Then in the dusk upon his arm it chanc'd That night that suddenly she fell asleep; And he look'd down on her like one entranc'd, And listen'd to her breathing still and deep, As if a little child, when daylight clos'd, With half-shut lids had ne'er before repos'd. Softly he laid her down from off his arm, With earnest care and new-born tenderness: Her infancy, like wonder-working charm, Laid hold upon his love; he staid to bless Her slumbering head; and going forth that night, He sought a nurse to tend his young delight. And day by day his heart she wrought upon, And won her way into its inmost foldâ A heart which, but for lack of that whereon To fix itself, would never have been cold; And opening wide, now let her come to dwell Within its strong unguarded citadel. She, like a dream, unlock'd the hidden springs Of his past life, and set their current free To talk with him of long-forgotten things, Wrought in his childhood and his infancy; Yet inly to repeat with mournful tone, âHopes of my childhood, whither have ye flown?â Long may thy childhood last, and late depart, Long dwell with thee, young blue-ey'd Margaret! Thou baby mistress of a soldier's heart That wonders it should love thee soâand yet Pondering thy friendless state, is well content To deem thee solely for his solace sent. A gleam of light upon a rainy day, A new-tied knot that must be sever'd soon; At sunrise brought within his tent to play, And hurried from the battle-field at noon; While face to face in hostile ranks they stood, Who should have dwelt in peace and brotherhood. But in the morning e'er the fight began, While yet were distant far the rebel bands, She heard at intervals a booming gun; And she was pleas'd, and, laughing, clapp'd her hands, Till he came in with troubled look and tone, Who chose her desolate to be his own. And he said, âLittle Madam, now farewell, For there will be a battle fought ere night. God be thy shield, for He alone can tell, Which way may fall the fortune of the fight. To fitter hands the care of thee pertain, My dear, if we two never meet again.â Then he gave money shortly to her nurse, And charg'd her that she should depart in haste, And leave the plain, whereon the deadly curse Of war should light with ruin, death, and waste, And all the ills that must its presence blight, E'en if proud victory should bless the right. âBut if the rebel cause should prosper, then It were not good among the hills to wend; But journey through to Boston in the fen, And wait for peace, if peace our God shall send; And if my life is spared, I will essay,â Quoth he, âto join you there as best I may.â So then he kiss'd the child, and went his way; But many troubles roll'd above his head; The sun arose on many an evil day, And cruel deeds were done, and tears were shed; And hope was lost, and loyal hearts were fain In dust to hide,âere they two met again. He found her after many days, when care And grief had been at work upon his soul, And for a while half dispossess'd her there, With their exacting sway and stern controlâ And with her dimples was again beguil'd, As on her nurse's knee she sat and smil'd. And he became a voyager by sea, And took the child to share his wandering state; Since from his native land compell'd to flee, And hopeless to avert her monarch's fate; For all was lost that might have made him pause, And, past a soldier's help, the royal cause. And thus roll'd on long days, and months, and years, And Margaret within the Xebec sail'd; The lulling winds made music to her ears, The bright sea hues her gentle eyes regal'd, And much she lov'd to see the dolphin spring, Where deep the water bows were glittering. The gay sea plants familiar were to her, As daisies to the children of the land; Red wavy dulse the sunburnt mariner Rais'd from its bed to glisten in her hand; The vessel and the sea were her life's stageâ Her house, her garden, and her hermitage. And there she had a cabin of her own, For beauty like an elfin palace bright, Adorn'd with Venice glass, like crystal stone, That cast around a many-colour'd light; And there with two caged ringdoves she did play, And feed them carefully from day to day. Her bed with silken curtains was enclos'd, White as the snowy rose of Guelderland; On Turkish pillows her young head repos'd, And love had gather'd with a careful hand Fair playthings to the little maiden's side, From distant ports, and cities parted wide. She had two myrtle plants that she did tend, And think all trees were like to them that grew; For things on land she did confuse and blend, And chiefly from the deck the land she knew, And in her heart she pitied more and more The stedfast dwellers on the changeless shore. Green fields and inland meadows faded out Of mind, or with sea images were link'd; And yet she had her childish thoughts about The country she had leftâthough indistinct And faint as mist the mountain head that shrouds, Dim in the distance, as Magellan's clouds. And when to frame a forest scene she tried, The ever-present sea would still intrude, And all her towns were by the water's side, The background of all scenes that memory view'd; And rocks and yellow sand would intervene, And waves surround her fancied village green. And she would dream and ponder more and more, When the land sounds reach'd her in dying swells; And when in harbour, lying off the shore, She heard the chiming of cathedral bells, She lov'd to think them Angels' hymns, although Deep in her inmost heart she knew it was not so. Her soul was like unto an ocean shell, That ever yields the key-note of its home; Whether her fancy to a shaded dell, Or quiet slope, or leafy glade, would roam, Or sun itself upon an upland hill, The voices of the sea would haunt her still. So she grew on, the idol of one heart, And the delight of manyâand her face, Thus dwelling chiefly from her sex apart, Was touch'd with a most deep and tender graceâ A look that never aught but nature gave, Artless, yet thoughtful; innocent, yet grave. Strange her adornings were, and strangely blent: A golden net confin'd her nut-brown hair; Quaint were the robes that divers lands had lent, And quaint her aged nurse's skill and care; Yet did they well on the sea-maiden meet, Circle her neck, and grace her dimpled feet. She, like a queen among her vassals seem'd, Who thought good fortune follow'd in her wake; And, counting her their guardian angel, deem'd That prospering winds were sent them for her sake; And strange, rough prayers and vows they nightly made For the fair child that in the Xebec stay'd. Clear were her eyes, that daughter of the sea, Sweet, when uplifted to her ancient nurse, She sat, and commun'd what the world could be; And rambling stories caus'd her to rehearse, How yule was kept, how maidens toss'd the hay, And how bells rang upon a wedding day. But they grew brighter when the evening star, First trembled over the still glowing wave, That bath'd in ruddy light, mast, sail, and spar; For then, reclin'd in rest that twilight gave, With him who served for father, friend, and guide, She sat upon the deck at evening tide. Then turn'd towards the west that on her hair And her young cheek shed down its tender glow, He taught her many things with earnest care, That he thought fitting a young maid should know, Till stars came out, and rais'd in twilight dim, Fell on the sea, the sailors' vesper hymn. Then many psalms he caus'd her to repeat, And sing them at his knees, reclin'd the while, And told her of the sabbath evenings sweet, And the pure worship of her native Isle: Told of the good deeds of the worthy dead, With prayers devout by holy martyrs said. Withdrawn, and heedless of the passing time, She heard the story of her native land, With many a legend grac'd and ancient rhyme Of wild adventures on a hostile strand; Till at the end he made her tears to flow, With telling of his royal master's woe. And of the stars he taught her, and their names, And how the chartless mariner they guide; Of quivering light that in the zenith plays, Of monsters in the deep sea caves that hide; Then chang'd the theme to fairy records wild, Enchanted moor, elf dame, or changeling child. But blooming childhood will not always last, And storms will rise e'en on the tideless sea: His guardian love took fright, she grew so fast, And he began to think how sad 'twould be If he should die, and pirate hordes should get, By sword or shipwreck his fair Margaret. It was a sudden thought; but he gave way, For it assail'd him with unwonted force; And with no more than one short week's delay, For English shores he shap'd the vessel's course; And ten years absent saw her landed now, With thirteen summers on her maiden brow. And so he journey'd with her, far inland, Down quiet lanes, by hedges gemm'd with dew, Where wonders met her eye on every hand, And all was strange and beautiful and newâ All, from the forest trees in stately ranks, To yellow cowslips trembling on the banks. All new,âthe clear still heat, the evening shades, The ruddy glow through cottage casement bright, The white-hair'd children, and the rustic maids, The hinds returning in the failing light, The streamlet dimly in the dusk espied, And gipsies camping on the broad road-side. And far he took them on, and farther still, The maiden and her nurse; till journeying, They saw an ancient city on a hill, And heard at intervals its clear bells ring: And its tall spires stood out against the sky, With mossy walls enclos'd, and portals high. There, dwelt a worthy matron whom he knew, To whom he did good service in the war; Shielding her household from the plundering crew, When neither worth could save, nor age nor law; And to her house he brought his care and pride, Aweary with the way, and dull and sleepy-ey'd. And he, the man whom she was fain to serve, Delay'd not shortly his request to make, Which was, if aught of her he did deserve, To take the maid, and rear her for his sake, To guard her youth, and let her breeding be In womanly reserve and modesty. And that same night into the house he brought The costly fruits of all his voyagesâ Rich gleaming stones, by wandering merchants bought In Turkish mosques and Persian palaces, With ingots pure, and coins of Venice mould, And silver bars, and bags of Spanish gold; And costly merchandize of foreign lands, With golden stuffs, and shawls of Eastern dye; He gave them over to the matron's hands, With jewell'd gauds, and toys of ivory, To be her dower on whom his love was set,â His dearest child, fair Madam Margaret. Then he entreated, that if he should die, She would not cease her guardian mission mild. Awhile, as undecided, linger'd nigh, Beside the pillow of the sleeping child, Sever'd one wandering lock of wavy hair, Took horse that night, and left her unaware. And it was long before he came againâ So long that Margaret was woman grown; And oft she wish'd for his return in vain, Calling him softly in an undertone; Repeating words that he had said the while, And striving to recal his look and smile. If she had knownâOh, if she could have knownâ The toils, the hardships of those absent yearsâ How bitter thraldom forc'd the unwilling groanâ How slavery wrung out subduing tears, Not calmly had she pass'd her years away, Chiding half pettishly the long delay. But she was spar'd that knowledge; she was calm, While the red flames ascended from the deck; Saw not the pirate band the crew disarm; Mourn'd not the scatter'd spars, the blacken'd wreck: She did not dream, and there was none to tell That fetters bound the hands she lov'd so well. Sweet Margaretâwithdrawn from human view, She spent long hours beneath the lime-tree's shade, The stately trees that in the garden grew, And overtwin'd, a towering shelter made; She mus'd among the flowers, and birds, and bees, In winding walks, and bowering canopies. Or wander'd slowly through the ancient rooms, Where oriel windows shed their rainbow gleams; Where tapestried hangings, work'd in Flemish looms, Display'd the story of king Pharaoh's dreams; Of tedious robe by Grecian matron wrought, Of clustering grapes the spies from Eshcol brought. At last she reach'd the bloom of womanhood, After five summers spent in growing fair; Her face betoken'd all things dear and good, And softly floated her descending hair; Young feeling gave her eyes their glances meek, And richness of musk roses to her cheek. Be not too hasty in your flow, ye rhymes, For Margaret is in her garden bower; Delay to ring, ye soft cathedral chimes, And tell not out too soon the noonday hour; For one is drawing near the portals wide Of the old city by the green hill's side. He journey'd on, and as he near'd the gate, He met with one to whom he nam'd the maid, Inquiring of her welfare, and her state, And of the matron in whose house she stay'd. âThe maiden dwelt there still,â the townsman said; âBut, for the ancient lady,âshe was dead.â He further said, she was but little known, Although reputed to be very fair, And little seen (so much she dwelt alone) But with her nurse at stated evening prayer; So seldom pass'd her sheltering garden wall, Or left the gate at quiet evening fall. Flow softly, rhymesâhis hand is on the door; Ring out, ye noonday bells, his welcomingâ âHe went out rich, but he returneth poor;â And strongânow something bow'd with suffering. And on his brow are trac'd long furrow'd lines, Earn'd in the fight with pirate Algerines. Her aged nurse comes hobbling at his call; Lifts up her wither'd hand in dull surprise, And, tottering, leads him through the pillar'd hall; âWhat! come at last, to bless my lady's eyes! Dear heart, sweet heart, she's grown a likesome maidâ Go, seek her where she sitteth in the shade.â The noonday chime had ceas'dâshe did not know Who watch'd her, while her ringdoves flutter'd near; While, under the green boughs in accents low, She sang unto herself, she did not hear His footstep till she turn'd, then rose to meet Her guest, with guileless blush and wonder sweet. But soon she knew him,âran with quicken'd pace, And threw her gentle arms around his neck, Leaning her fair cheek to his sunburnt face, As long ago upon the vessel's deck; As long ago she did in twilight deep, While heaving waters lull'd her infant sleep. So then he kiss'd her, and in fondest tone, While proudly parting her unbraided hair, He said: âI did not think to see thee grown So fair a woman,ââbut a touch of care The deep-ton'd voice through its caressing kept, And, hearing it, she turn'd away and wept. Wept,âfor an impress on the face she view'dâ The stamp of feelings she remember'd not; His voice was calmer far, but more subdued, Not like the voice long lov'd and unforgot! She felt strange sorrow and delightful painâ Grief for the change, joy that he came again. O pleasant days, that follow'd his return, That made his captive years pass out of mind; But Margaret, a scholar apt to learn, He taught one lesson more than he design'd. And two full weeks he stay'd with her; content To find her beautiful and innocent. And then, he told her that he must depart Upon the morrow with the earliest light; And it displeas'd and pain'd her at the heart: And she went out, to hide her from his sight. And in a garden alley shelter'd deep She threw herself among dusk leaves to weep. And she bemoan'd herself,âtill suddenly She heard a step, and, starting up to flee, She met him face to face,âand tenderly He question'd with her what her grief could be? Till at the last, all blushing red for shame, She said it was because she had no name. And he replied, âDear child, I do not know Thy father's race, but none thy tears can blame. Wouldst thou possess the thing for which they flow? Get thee an husband then, and bear his name. Is there none here who thy kind thoughts hath won?â And, faltering, she answer'd, âTruly none.â But he, in fatherly and kindly mood, Said, âLady, daughter, it would please me well To see thee wed; for know, it is not good That a fair woman thus alone should dwell.â She said, âI am content it should be so, If when you journey, I may with you go.â And when he heard, he fell into a pause, A long, half-doubting pause of deep content; Then thought heââIt were wronging nature's laws That this should be.â In troubled wonderment, He stood. He ne'er had ask'd a boon so high; Though offer'd, it was hard to put it by. Then he said, âLady, look into my face; Consider well this scar upon my brow; I have had all misfortunes but disgrace, And shall I seek so great a blessing now? Be not of gratitude deceiv'dâI know Thou think'st it is thy dutyâI will go. I read thy meaning, and I go from hence, Skill'd in thy reasons, though my heart be rude; I will not wrong thy gentle innocence, Nor take advantage of thy gratitude.â Then she said, âGo, but few of womankind Shall be more sad than she you leave behind.â âStill wouldst thou speak? Ah, lady, thou art young; Shall this rough voice, this face, thy bright dreams dim? Some fairy over me a spell hath flung, And it beguiles thee.â But she answer'd himâ âThe face is fair to me, without a spell; And for the voice, I love its accents well.â So softly she drew nearer to his side, Beseeching him, and saying, âDo not go;â Till, but in tones that falter'd, he replied, âTruly, I love thee well; but dost thou know That I shall soon grow old?â She said, âIn truth, Your age will better shield my helpless youth.â Then, from her earnest words her heart he knew, And lean'd towards her in the dusky shade; Saying, âForgive me, if it seem'd untrue; It was so like a dream, beloved maidâ A flattering dream, with morning light to fleeâ A dream of happiness not meant for me.â And soft, as ringdoves cooing with spread wings, She murmur'd to him, underneath the trees, âAnd do you think there are no other things Than morning dreams that go by contraries? 'Twas surely strange to doubt the voice that woo'd, And call a young maid's love cold gratitude.â And so she won a name that eventide, Which he gave gladly, but would ne'er bespeak, And she became the rough sea-captain's bride, Matching her dimples to his sunburnt cheek; And chasing from his voice the touch of care, That made her weep when first she heard it there. One yearâone long, bright year of happiness, That glided like a quiet stream awayâ Then came her hour of trouble and distress: It was the evening of a sultry day: There was not air the thread-hung flowers to stir; Or float abroad the filmy gossamer. Towards the trees his steps, her husband bent; Pacing the grassy walks with restless feet: And he recall'd, and ponder'd as he went, All her most duteous love and converse sweet, Till summer darkness settled deep and dim; And dew from bending leaves dropt down on him. The flowers sent forth their nightly odours faintâ Thick leaves shut out the starlight overhead; While he told over, as by strong constraint Drawn on, her childish life on shipboard led, And beauteous youth, since first low kneeling there, With folded hands, she lisp'd her evening prayer. Then he remember'd how, beneath the shade, She woo'd him to her with her lovely words, While flowers were closing, leaves in moonlight play'd, And in dark nooks withdrew the silent birds. So ponder'd he that night in twilight dim; While dew from bending leaves dropt down on him. The flowers sent forth their nightly odours faintâ When, in the darkness waiting, he saw one To whom he saidââHow fareth my sweet saint?â Who answer'dââShe hath borne to you a son;â Then, turning, left him,âand the father said, âGod rain down blessings on his welcome head!â But Margaret!âshe never saw the child; Nor heard about her bed love's mournful wails; But to the last, with ocean dreams beguil'd, Murmur'd of troubled seas and swelling sailsâ Of weary voyages, and rocks unseen, And distant hills in sight, all calm and green. . . . Woe and alas!âthe times of sorrow come, And make us doubt if we were ever glad! So utterly that inner voice is dumb, Whose music through our happy days we had! So, at the touch of grief, without our will, The deep heart's melody is mute and still. Woe and alas! for the sea-captain's wifeâ That Margaret who in the Xebec play'dâ She spent upon his knee her baby life; Her slumbering head upon his breast she laid. How shall he learn alone his years to pass? How in the empty house?âwoe and alas! She died.âAnd in the dim Cathedral aisle They made her grave,âand there, with fond intent, Her husband rais'd, his sorrow to beguile, A very fair and stately monumentâ A tomb that still the careless vergers showâ The tomb ofâMargaret Del Angelo. A woman's figure, with the eyelids clos'd, And the calm head declin'd in slumber sweetâ One hand upon a sculptur'd ship repos'd, An anchor and an ensign at her feet. And, carv'd upon the borders of her vest, The motto of her house,ââHe giveth rest.â There is an ancient window, richly fraught, And fretted with all hues, most deep and bright; And in its upper tracery is wrought An olive branch, and dove with feathers whiteâ An emblem meet for her, the tender dove,â Her heavenly peace and duteous earthly love. Crimson, and green, and gold, and violet, In twisted knots, and wildly tangled bands, Amid heraldic shields and banners set, Fall softly on the snowy, sculptur'd hands; And, ev'ry sunny day reflected, rest The dove and olive branch upon her breast. No. II.âMARGARET BY THE MERESIDE. Lying imbedded in the green champaign That gives no shadows to thy silvery face, Set in the middle of a verdant plain, Only the clouds their forms upon thee trace; No steadfast hills on thee reflected rest, Nor waver with the dimpling of thy breast. O, silent Mere! about whose marges spring Thick bulrushes, to hide the reed-bird's nest; Where the shy ousel dips her glossy wing, And, balanc'd in the water, takes her rest: While, under bending leaves, all gem-array'd, Bright dragon-flies lie panting in the shade. Warm, stilly place,âthe sun-dew loves thee well, And the green sward comes creeping to thy brink; And poor-man's-weather-glass, and pimpernel, Lean down to thee their perfum'd heads, to drink; And heavy with the weight of bees doth bend White clover, and beneath thy wave descend. Where does the scent of beanfields float so wide, At intervals returning on the air, As over mead and fen to thy lone side, To lose itself among thy zephyrs rare, With scents from hawthorn copse, and new-cut hay, And blooming orchards lying far away? Thou hast thy sabbaths, when a deeper calm Descends upon thee, quiet Mere! and then The sound of ringing bells, thy peace to charm, From grey church towers comes far across the fen: And the light sigh, where grass and waters meet, Seems thy meek welcome to their visits sweet. Thou hast thy lovers, though the angler's rod Dimples thy surface seldom; and the oar Fills not with silvery globes thy fringing sod, Nor sends long ripples to thine osier'd shore; And few would care with mimic art to trace The lights and shadows on thy changing face. Thou hast thy lovers truly; 'mid the cold Of northern tarns the wild-fowl dream of thee, And, keeping thee in mind, their wings unfold, And shape their course, high soaring, till they see Down in the world, like molten silver, rest Their goal; and, screaming, plunge them in thy breast. Fair Margaret,âwho sittest all day long On the grey stone beneath the sycamore, The bowering tree with branches lithe and strong, The only one to grace the level shoreâ Why dost thou wait? for whom, with patient cheer, Gaze yet so wistfully adown the Mere? Thou canst not tellâthou dost not knowâalas! Long watchings leave behind them little trace; And yet, how sweetly must the mornings pass That bring that dreamy calmness to thy face; How quickly must the evenings come, that find Thee still regret, to leave the Mere behind. Thy cheek is resting on thy hand;âthine eyes Are like twin violets, but half unclos'd; Calm as the azure stillness of the skies: Never more peacefully in love repos'd A mother's gaze upon her offspring dear, Than thine, upon the long, far-stretching Mere. Sweet innocent! Thy yellow hair floats low In rippling undulations on thy breast; Then stealing down, the parted love-locks flow, Bath'd in the sunbeams, on thy knees to rest; And touch those idle hands, that folded lie, Having, from toil and sport, alike immunity. O silent Being! with what touching grace Childhood attends thee, nearly woman grown; Her dimples linger yet upon thy face, Like dew upon a rose, but newly blown; And thy long tender sighs, upheaving, seem Calm as an infant's sighing in a dream. What are thy thoughts made up of? Do they stray Abroad with wand'ring swallows in the air, Or sport themselves with circling flies, that play Under thy sycamore;âthen here and there, Float idly, turn'd aside by roving bee, Or by a wand'ring cloud led easily? No, down the Mere, as far as eye can see, Where its long reaches fade into the sky, Thy constant gaze, fair child, rests lovingly; But neither thou, nor any, can descry Aught but the osier banks and rustling sedge, And flocks of wild-fowl splashing at their edge. And yet 'tis not in expectation hush'd, That thy mute rosy lips, half-pouting, close; No flutt'ring hope to thy young heart e'er rush'd, Nor disappointment troubled its reposeâ All satisfied with gazing evermore Along the open Mere and reedy shore. The brooding wren flies pertly near thy seat; Thou wilt not move, to mark her glancing wing. The timid sheep browse close before thy feet; And heedless at thy side the thrushes sing;â So long among them thou hast spent thy days, They know that harmless hand thou wilt not raise. Thou wilt not lift it upânot e'en to take The foxglove bells that flourish in the shade, And put them in thy bosom; not to make A posy of wild hyacinths, inlaid Like bright mosaic in the mossy grass, With freckled orchis, and pale sassafras. Gaze on;âtake in, the voices of the Mere,â The break of shallow water at thy feet, Its splash among long weeds, and grasses sere, And its low sobbing;âhollow music, meet For ears like thine; listen and take thy fill, And dream of it by night, when all is still. Full sixteen years have slowly pass'd away, Young Margaret, since thy fond mother here Came down, a six months' wife, one April day, To see her husband's boat go down the Mere, And track its course, till, lost in distance blue, In mellow light it faded from her view. It faded, and she never saw it more;â Nor any human eye;âoh, grief! oh, woe! It faded,âand return'd not to the shore; But far above it still the waters flowâ And none beheld it sink, and none could tell Where coldly slept the form she lov'd so well! But that sad day, unknowing of her fate, She homeward turn'd her still reluctant feet; And at her wheel she spun, till dark and late, The evening fell;âthe time when they should meet;â Till the stars pal'd that at deep midnight burn'dâ And morning dawn'd, and he was not return'd. And the bright sun came upâshe thought too soon, And shed his ruddy light along the Mere; And day wore on too quickly, and at noon She came, and wept beside the waters clear. âHow could he be so late?ââand then hope fled; And disappointment darken'd into dread. He never came; and she, with weeping sore, Peer'd in the water-flags unceasingly, Through all the undulations of the shore, Searching for that which most she fear'd to see, At length she took home sorrow to her heart; And brooded over its cold, cruel smart! And then all hopelessly she sat alone, And mourn'd, refusing to be comforted, On the grey stoneâthe moss-embroider'd stone, With the tall sycamore above her head. Till, after many days, a broken oar, Hard by her seat, was left upon the shore. It came, a token of his fateâthe whole, The sum of her misfortunes, to revealâ As if sent up in pity to her soul, The tidings of her widowhood to seal; And put away the pining hope forlorn, That made her grief more bitter to be borne. And she was patient,âthrough the weary day She toil'd, though none was there her work to bless; And did not wear the sullen months away, Nor call on Death to end her wretchedness; But, lest her grief should overflow her breast, She toil'd as heretofore, and would not rest. But her work done, what time the evening star Rose over the cool water, then she came To the grey stone, and saw its light from far, Drop down the misty Mere white lengths of flame; And wonder'd whether there might be the place Where the soft ripple wander'd o'er his face. Unfortunateâin solitude forlorn She dwelt, and thought upon her husband's grave; Till, when the days grew short, a child was born To the dead father underneath the wave: And it brought back a remnant of delightâ A little sunshine to its mother's sight. . . . Across the pastur'd lea, across the wold, There stands a mansion grey. At early dawn, Beneath its lofty roof, its turrets old, On that same day another child was born; And, with a father's welcome, laid to rest, Cradled in down, from its young mother's breast. Cradled in down, and canopied with plumes, As helpless as the orphan babe he slept, Though rob'd in lace, and lull'd in stately rooms, While hireling nurses watch about him kept. And on the new-born heir his father's eyes Dwelt often, with a strange and sweet surprise. Far different was their birth, and such should be The tenor of their lives. The early years Of one pass'd on with laughter, and with glee; The other, nurtur'd amid sighs and tears, Grew, like a young plant in a quiet glade, Nourish'd with dew, and budding in the shade. But not like careless childhood's were her ways, Deep quiet dwelt upon her forehead fair: And oft abroad she fix'd her tender gaze, As if she saw a face that was not thereâ Would turn, as if a voice had touch'd her ear, A tone that other mortals could not hear. And years flew on âand she was still the same; Nor human language she had learn'd to speak; Her lips were mute; but seasons went and came, And brought fresh beauties to her maiden cheek. And all the day upon the sunny shore She sat and mus'd beneath the sycamore. Strange sympathy! she watch'd and wearied not; Haply unconscious what it was she sought: Her mother's tale she easily forgot; And if she listen'd, no warm tears it brought. Though surely in the yearnings of her heart The unknown voyager must have had his part. Unknown to her;âlike all she saw, unknown; All sights were fresh, as when they first began; All sounds were new, each murmur, and each tone, And cause and consequence she could not scan: Forgot that night brought darkness in its train, Nor reason'd that the day would come again. . . . There is a happiness in past regret, As echoes of the harshest sounds are sweet. The mother's soul was struck with grief, and yet, Repeated in the child's, 'twas not unmeet, That echo-like, that grief a tone should take, Painless, but always pensive, for her sake. For her dear sake, whose patient soul was link'd By ties so many to the babe unbornâ Whose hope, by slow degrees become extinct, For evermore had left her child forlorn, Yet left no consciousness of want or woe; Nor vague regret that these things should be so. It was a dream, this worldâan endless dream, To which all sounds and senses minister'd; Mingling things true with things that did but seem,â She held mute converse, without sign or word, With sighs of whispering grass, wind-lifted flowers, Slight voices that pass by dull ears like ours. Truly her joys were limited and few; She watch'd in shade the summer day glide on; She had fond thoughts about the glittering dew, And saw fantastic shapes at even-songâ Unreal delights! the restless spirit deems; Pity her not.âHer griefs?âthey too were dreams! So sat she always underneath her tree, The fairest thing the country round had seen, With her small hand dropp'd idly on her knee, Clad in her russet-hat and gown of greenâ Through the spring mornings, gemm'd with melted rime, All through hay-harvest, and through gleaning time. And oft the lady from the mansion old, With her young son, the silent child would seek, Teach him his arms around her to enfold, With prattling words to kiss her dimpled cheek; Till from her side he lightly broke away, Busied with floating straws or leaves at play. And oft, grown older, to the Mere he stray'd, And sported on its shores the whole day long; When that kind lady in her grave was laid, With all her tender thoughts so deep and strongâ Having pass'd lightly from her husband's mind; Lost there,âbut for the child she left behind. Oh, pleasure for itself that boyhood makes! Oh, happiness about the fields to roam! He watch'd, down crouching in the hawthorn brakes, While the small white-throats built their hanging home; Follow'd with cautious oar the wild duck's track, And trac'd the landrail to her nestlings back. And yet they took him from his fenny wold, The reedy Mere, and all his pastimes thereâ The place where he was born, and should grow old, If God his life so many years should spareâ From the lov'd haunts of childhood, and the plain, And pasture lands of his own broad domain. And so he came when wheat was in the sheaf; And ripen'd hazel nuts were dropping down; While whirling slowly, fell the yellow leaf; And standing beans were turning sere and brown; He came from his grey turrets to the shore, And sought the maid beneath the sycamore. He sought her, not because her tender eyes Would brighten at his coming; for he knew No thought of him within her heart would rise, When once he had departed from her view; Though he had link'd affections pure and mild With the sweet image of the silent child. For boyhood, like maturity, is prone To reverence what it cannot understand; And he had thought, while thus she mus'd alone, Some saintly reason kept her on the strand. Some dream of heaven within her heart must glow, Who took so little heed of aught below. A fishing wallet from his shoulders slung, With bounding foot he reach'd the mossy place; A little moment gently o'er her hung, Put back her hair, and look'd into her face; Heav'd a short boyish sigh of kind regret, And call'd her âMargaret, sweet Margaret.â And he said âListen,âhear what I shall say; Only this once thy dreamy eyes withdraw; To-morrow I am going far away,â Ah! look at me before I leave the shore. But why should I say this? You'll soon forget: Farewell, till I return, sweet Margaret!â And wilt thou think on him when he is gone? Noâthou wilt gaze, though thy young eyes grow dim, And thy soft cheek become all pale and wan; Still thou wilt gaze; and spend no thought on him: There is no sweetness in his voice for thee, Nor beauty in his young heart's gaiety! But wherefore linger in deserted haunts? Why of the past, as if yet present, sing? The yellow Iris on the margin flaunts, The shore is gay with Hyacinths in spring, And dappled skies are mirror'd in the wave, Where stooping swallows dip their wings to lave. But, MargaretâAh! thou art there no moreâ And thick dank moss creeps over thy grey stone; Thy path is lost, that skirted the low shore With willow grass, and speedwell overgrown; Thine eye has closed for ever, and thine ear Drinks in no more the music of the Mere! The Baron's son shall come again in Spring, Well pleas'd to angle in the waters clear; And some kind offering in his hand will bring, To cast into thy lap, O maiden dear! Some silver brooch, some clasp to bind thy vest, And heave and glimmer on thy guileless breast. And he shall wonder why thou art not here, The solitude âwith smiles to entertain;â And gaze along the reaches of the Mere; But he shall never see thy face again; Shall never see upon the reedy shore Pale Margaret beneath her sycamore! FAMILY PICTURES. Heavy drops of rain are falling, Murky clouds float out to sea; While alone I stand for shelter Underneath the lofty treeâ Under the broad tree that shadows Half the roof above our heads, Where beside the threshold growing, Like a tow'ring tent it spreads. It is tide-time, and the shower Passes over like a frown: Yellow sunbeams through the branches To my feet come trembling down. Light air wand'ring through the garden Shakes the rain from leaf and bell, From the bending Persian lily, And the foxglove's laden cell. Looking in at open windows, Many thoughts my spirit pain, Rooms long dwelt in, I shall seldom Wander through their lengths again. To their walls the sunbeams creeping, Rows of quiv'ring gems have strung; Little rainbows, struck from mirrors, All about the cornice flung. Round upon the walls are hanging Pictures in their moulded frames,â From my childhood I have lov'd themâ Taught to call them by their names. Household treasuresâwe shall take them With us when we journey on; Forms of those who went before us, Records of the dead and gone! Ah! I see that one, which chiefly To my childish thoughts was fair; In a high alcove she sitteth, With a white rose in her hair. Climbing woodbines round her growing Fling their trailing tendrils wide,â And her meek eyes seem to follow, As we move from side to side. Hollyhocks about her planted Proudly rear their spiral heads, And one primrose-tinted blossom On her feet its petals sheds. Rang'd upon the steps are standing Flow'ring Balsams in a row, Hanging bunches of Laburnum Train'd upon the trellis grow. From her side her little daughter Looks up sweetly in her face, With a boddice like her mother's, And a cap of shadowing lace. Smiling through her flaxen ringlets, Primly, prettily, she standsâ Two young ringdoves in a basket Holding in her dimpled hands. Lady, with the placid forehead, Holy in its deep reposeâ With a shuttle in thy fingers, Twisted in thy hair a roseâ Did no oft-return'd vexations Baffling, in thy pathway rise? If they did, no trace they've left us In the summer of thine eyes! What?âdid nothing come to ruffle Or disturb thy quiet mood?â Was thy kindness always valued, And thy meaning understood?â Hadst thou never days of trouble,â Fretful moments such as these? Where thy children ne'er unruly, Nor thy husband hard to please? I have stood and look'd upon thee Often when I was a childâ Thinking that when I grew older I would be as calm and mild: Thinking it would be no trouble Such a quiet to maintainâ Once escap'd from irksome lessonsâ Oh! delusion deep and vain! For alas! As years roll'd onward, Reason grewâand feeling came; Thou wert farther off than ever, Though my longings were the same. Then I wish'd that I had liv'd in Such a time as gave thee birth; Ere the âblessing of our Fathers,â Peace, had vanish'd from the earth. Strange, that when we long for something Which can never be obtain'd, In our hearts we turn to others Who we deem the boon have gain'd. But we always think they sojourn In some very distant clime, Or are far divided from us By the silent lapse of time. Far away,âor dead before us,â Time and distance are the same; For uncertain lights and shadows In the space between they frame. I have thought if far-off manners, Or the old-world life were mine, Free from restless throbbings, Lady, I had felt a peace like thine! Now I know 'tis but illusion; There is silence in my heart; Murmurous thoughts, like stars at morning, Shrink within me and depart. No! the past was not more happy, 'Tis the present that mistakes; These the types of favour'd moments We have lengthen'd for their sakes, Who have run their course before us, Having left their forms behind, Till in dreaming their forms behind, To our own we are unkind. Human cares and human passions In ourselves we feel and see, Not upon their quiet facesâ Thus we think that they were free. Simple thoughts they were to harbour: Truly life had changes thenâ Working days as well as Sabbaths,â Was it e'er without them? When? Never! Endless, shifting changes Swift as waves each other chase, Come upon God's men and women, Fit them for a changeless place. Yet there are some resting-placesâ Life's untroubled interludesâ Times when neither past nor future On the soul's deep calm intrudes. For such hour the painter waitedâ Fix'd the look that still they wear, And their children's children gazing, Think that they were free from care! But it seems, when all is spoken, That a quiet so serene Never in our stillest moments Us and change can come between. For though all we love be round us, Growing kinder day by day, Still our hearts will mutely ponder: âShortly these may flee away.â Or if in our happy bosoms All such anxious fears be laid, Tender feelings for another On the brow will cast a shadeâ Work within the âlittle chamber,â Dark and silent, of the heart, Pitying the slighted stranger, Taking the oppressed's part. Dwellers near the restless ocean, Though they hear the blackbird sing, And the bearded barley rustle, And the young lambs bleat in spring; Though Cathedral bells may reach them, Clear and sweet across the lea, Yet for ever in the background, Looms the murmur of the sea! So it is with human feeling, Even in our summer days, When our hearts are light with laughter, And our ears are fill'd with praise; There are thoughts for ever present, Held at distance though they be, Always heardâthough unobtrusive, Like the murmur of the sea. What are they repeating always? From their tones the mind receives Chast'ning in the brightest mornings, Counsel in the clearest eves. Do not give them form and language, Look them seldom in the face, Lest they start into the foreground, Take and keep the foremost place. Yet we must have been ungrateful: Evil blinds us to the good; Paradise is taken from usâ Who shall tell us where it stood? Dreaming of the four-leav'd shamrock Never given to mortal lot, We awake, and in our folly Weep, because we have it not! In the early days of childhood When we spoke our mother tongue, So that few could understand us But our nurses kind and young; Folded in their arms at even, While they press'd our baby heads, Some sweet lullaby to sing us, Ere they laid us in our beds;â We would lift a tiny finger, And unclose our sleepy eyes, Pointing at the stars that twinkling Glimmer'd in the shady skies; Babbling to our loving nurses That we wish'd the stars would fall, For, among our nursery playthings, They would be the best of all. And full lovingly they answer'd, âThat if we were always good, Some fine night they should not wonder If they dropp'd into the wood: If they dropp'd among the dock leaves Where the willow wort was sown; Then, as soon as it was morning, We should have them for our own!â So they sooth'd us, and, contented, In their arms we fell asleep: While they pray'd the holy angels Watch around our beds to keep. So they pleas'd and so beguil'd us With their promises of good; But the little stars we found not Down among the underwood! We should think it strange if children We were reckon'd, still the same Even in the wayward wishes That in them we fondly blame: Very strange, though still we long for Things that Reason still debars, And although we all our lifetime Have been longing for the stars. We must gaze on them no longer, Leave them to their high estates, Heaven's pavement lies above themâ Think upon the golden gates: Let them shine, as when beforetime The Most High his might unfurl'd, Bright as when they sang together On the birthday of the world. And when Time shall bring her doomsday, Will a dirge be sung on high? Will they miss the one departed From the myriads of the sky? Matters not, so we inherit, Borne beyond their fiery cars Ancient homes appointed for us, Mansions older than the stars. So that we may hear, and marvel When our ears shall catch a tone, As it were the voice of harpers Harping round about the throneâ So our feet may reach that country Lov'd and long'd for from afar, And our eyes may see the beauty Of the Bright and Morning Star! KATHERINE OF ARRAGON TO HENRY VIII. ON HEARING OF HIS INTENTION TO DIVORCE HER. Prince, I have heardâit ill beseems That thou the tale repeat; Still less that I should bend my knee To plead or to entreat. Reproaches! No! thou need'st no fear That I such words should use; E'en could'st thou stoop to sue me back, My heart must now refuse. Far in my own, my native land, Beneath its sunny skies, Are dwelling those by thee estrang'd, Who would have dried mine eyes: But no! I would not have them back My bitter tears to see: I would not have them meanly think Or proudly speak of thee! Prince, in the upper fields of air (If sages deem aright), A planet compass'd in a ring Speeds on its ceaseless flight; For evermore encircled thus It tracks yon desert blue, And onward as the planet rolls The ring rolls onward too. Go, like the planet, wander forth On passion's stormy sea; Like the bright ring, my faithful love Must still encircle thee! Thou canst not check, shalt not escape, Its tribute deep and free, An offering of the only grace That still remains to me! Take back thy giftsâI heed them not, Since of thyself bereft; Take my young daughter from my arms, The only solace left: Bring the fair rival in thy love My sad estate to view; But hope not to estrange my heart, For that thou canst not do! Oh, bring not up the beauteous past, Kind memory! let it rest For ever shrouded far from sight Deep in my bleeding breast: Forbear to mock with past delight A grief beyond control: Look back no more, since all is lostâ Forgetâforget, my soul! MIMIE'S GRASS-NEST. In the quiet of the garden, While beside the nut-trees walking, Came our little sister to us.ââPardon,â Said she, âif I interrupt your talking, I have got a grass nest to display you, O do come and sit in it, I pray you: By myself I made it: there will be Room enough within for you and me.â Merrily before us dancing She look'd up into our faces; Then again towards her grass nest glancing, Made, returning to it, a few paces. âI'll go make it ready. Will you follow? O it's like a bird's nest, round and hollow. Gardener says, those linnets in the vine Have not got a better nest than mine.â âWe would come,â we said, she flitting On before us, to make ready, When we reach'd the lawn, we found her sitting, With all state, and aspect grave and steady, In her nest. âSit down,â she said: âI made it Of the new-mown grass, with trees to shade it, And then set it round with this white May, And red Peonies, to make it gay.â On the beauty of the dwelling Gave we plenteous gratulation; Then said, âMadam, we await your telling Of what wing'd sweet-throated tribe or nation You may be.â âBird's life,â in accents musing, âWould not suit with such as I for choosing,â Said she; âbut a Fairy I will be, And you in this house shall live with me.â Oh! yes, this shall be my Palace, Or my fairy ring the rather, This gold tulip I will have for chalice, And this branch for sceptre, which my father Who rules six enchanted castles bravely, Sent me!â âCry you mercy!â said I gravely, âWhat mistakes we mortals make at bestâ I had thought this palace was a nest! âNow I see, with eyes compliant, 'Tis a palace, and enchantedâ That which seem'd an oak tree is a giant, These which I thought Sumachs near it planted Are two dragons, ragged-tooth'd and spiteful, Set to guard us, and these songs delightful Come from fairies, who can, when they please, Change to birds, and sing upon the trees!â âYes, it is so,â said she gaily; âAnd you two shall be Princesses; You must know that knights and damsels daily Come to me for aid in their distresses. Now I sit in state, and pray your Graces, Tell me, wherefore have you left your places? In all fairy learning I am vers'd: I will hear the youngest Princess first!â Then the youngest Princess, pausing, Look'd around to aid invention, Smiles which hover'd round her red lips causing Me, who watch'd, to fathom her intention. She look'd much like one who had no sorrow Worth the telling, so one needs must borrow, Meet to reach the blue-ey'd Fairy's ear, Who sat scepter'd on the grass to hear. âIn a forest, Fairy Dame, Stands my Father's Palace: Well he loves me; and my name Is the Princess Alice. Trees of right great age and girth Thickly round it planted, Scare the sons of outer earth From its glades enchanted. Few of mortal race that dare Those deep woods to enter, Fewer far that reach the fair Palace in the centre. Yet of mortal race are we, Though we look undaunted On its shadow'd mystery, And its sunlight haunted. There the dwarfish people fell Have their habitations, There thy elfin kindred dwell By their tribes and nations: There the ripen'd citron breaks From the branch untasted;â Let the man beware who takes Of that banquet wasted! Hands invisible shall snatch Sword or staff for payment; Things unseen shall deftly catch At his flutt'ring raiment. There do smiling faces peep Out from beeches hollow, Beckoning on to defiles deepâ Woe to all that follow! There the white-rob'd phantoms glide, With their hands behind them, Crying outââO, cease to rideâ Take these hands and bind them!â Let him 'ware to slack his rein, Or regard their faces, Lest to serve them he be fain In their desert places. There, above-ground flits and roams The wisp-light before us; And beneath, the toiling gnomes Sing their evil chorus: When the clouded sun goes inâ âWaiting for the thunderââ We can hear their revel-din The moss'd greensward under: And, I tell you, all the birds, On the branches singing, Utter to us human words, Like a silver ringing. Oh! my father hath in truth Bearing high and stately; And my mother's face in youth Might be lauded greatly. Long time were they wedâbut child Had notâson nor daughterâ Till my sainted mother mild, Near some running water, Spinning once in mossy glade With her Maids of honour, And the ash-tree's greenest shade Softly cast upon herâ She was 'ware of fingers four, With impassion'd gesture, (One small hand and nothing more) Plucking at her vesture. âSit ye still, my maids,â she cried, Rising up serenely; âI would walk this rill beside Over-arch'd so greenly.â Fast the little hand took hold, By the stream it drew her; Red rays through the fir-trees old Trembled down unto her: She could hear two small feet pace Closely on beside her, But to see the spirit face (Saith she) was denied her; And she follow'd to a place Where the stream grew wider. There were stepping-stones, and green Grew the cresses round them; Bright the waters were between, Where the sun-rays found them. She look'd up, and nought could see But some grey doves dozing, In a noontide reverie Their red eyelids closing. In the heat the fir trees thick Never mov'd asunder, And albeit her heart beat quick, It was but with wonder. She look'd down, was nought below Save the shallow water, And the little hand let go, Thus far having brought her! Quoth she then (with no more dread Than by silence made is), âWherefore, little hand, hast led Me from my fair ladies?â She could hear a rustling sound As of doves descending, And soft voices near the ground With the stream's voice blending. Natheless, doves were none, and grave Words came sweet before herâ âIs this, sooth, that woman brave, That fair queen, Eudora? Will she bear us by her aid Safe across the water, With our grey wings shut?â It sayde, âHast thou yet besought her?â âNay!â the answ'ring voice replied, Scantly to her reaching; âBut her human heart is wide, And needs no beseeching!â âAy,â quoth she, â'tis even so; Voice, thou speakest truly! Let the things I see not, know I will bear them duly!â As a snowflake falling white, One the other follows, Fast they settled, soft and light, As a flight of swallows, On her vest and on her armsâ âThanks, King Meroc's daughter,ââ So she bore them safe from harms Straight across the water. Scarce her foot had touch'd the bank With the wondrous burden, Than she saw them, rank by rankâ Sooth, an ample guerdonâ Creatures beautiful and rare, Turn'd they all to greet herâ Somewhat more than human fair, And with voices sweeter. Sprang they down to earth, and trod Each with bearing knightly: âRise up straightway from the sod,â Horses!â cried they, lightly. And the horses, from the ground, Rose up at their calling; Rose up with a snorting sound, And with bridles falling. Spake the foremost, set in selle, Safe across the water, âMadam, queen, I wish thee well, Thee, thy prince, and daughter!â Quoth my mother, âMock me not With thy words unkindly, Daughter, Knight, I have not got;â But she answer'd blindly. Loud he laugh'd, and tall he grew, Sitting straight before her, âMy good wishes aye come true, Oh! fair queen Eudora! âFarewell, stream! My foe's deep hate Keeps us not asunder, Madam Queen, thy ladies wait, Wait for thee, and wonder! Spells upon the margin laidâ Charms upon the waterâ Hast thou broken by thine aid, Good king Meroc's daughter!â On the self-same day at noon, One short twelvemonth after, Of my birth the tidings soon Fill'd the place with laughter. On that day sweet voices rang In my father's palace, And the birds, I tell you, sangâ âWelcome, Princess Alice!â Then the small tree-people came With their gratulations, And each matron fairy-dame Of the green-clad nations, Gliding to my mother's bed, Gave her low-voic'd greeting, Wishing on my infant head For all good things meeting. Up by thousands blithe and small Came they in the gloaming,â âWish ye joy,â they cried to all Whom they met in roaming. Here and there in silken sheen, Soft their garments flutter'd; Here and there for babe and queen Their good wishes utter'd. âThanks, fair Dames!â My father cried, âHere, Sir Page, my chalice! Happy seasons ye betide, And the sweet maid Alice: This I drink to your good health, As my bounden duty; The dear saints increase your wealth, And prolong your beauty!â Ere the word was utter'd, they Crowded to the portals, And with laughter keen did sayâ âOh! these dull immortals!â On the day that I was wean'd, One came to my chamber, On a golden stick she lean'd, With a head of amber. She was aged, swart, and bent, But her speech was cheery, And she totter'd as she went, As with travel weary. âMother! for thine infant dear,â Quoth she, tartly speaking, âHave I got a present here Worthy of her seeking.â Straightway, beautiful as light, Fair in limb and feature, From her bosom sprang a Sprite, A winged childlike creature. Oh! to me, to me she fled Ere the words were spoken; And the ancient Fairy saidâ âKnow, by this same token, That she nestles at thy heart, Loth from thee to severâ If she one day shall depart, Best it be for ever! Little Princess, hold her dear, Know, for all her dimples, Potent Sprite she is, as e'er Work'd with wand or simples.â We were playmates the year round In a change of pleasure, With her glamour spells she found Heaps of unus'd treasure. When we feasted in the fern Growing round the palace, Easy 'twas for her to turn Acorn cup to chalice, And to call up elfins gay With us there to revel, When the ruddy King of Day Peer'd in broad and level. Me she endlessly beguil'dâ Fairy, who can blame her? Look'd up in my face and smil'd, Well those smiles became her! In my bosom she did sleep, With my dreams she blended, Visions such as make me weep Now, to feel them ended! Aye, indeed! and sooth to say, Birds did sing at dawning, âPlay on, little Princess, playâ Merry go the morning.â It was she who made them sing, With her chain she bound them; Like a garment she did fling Glamour light around them: And within the magic hall Of my Father's palace, Bid the prankish elves to call, âWelcome, Princess Alice!â When we look'd into the night Through the wicket peering, Wondrous things there were for sight, Wondrous things for hearing. Then the shadows of the trees Stretch'd their long arms nigher, And the spirit of the breeze Touch'd for us her lyre; Came and whisper'd at our eaves Melodies entrancing, With a train of yellow leaves In her pathway dancing: While the sleeping birds she rock'd Through the forest flying, And the minstrel's cadence mock'd, In the turrets sighing. Ah! methinks I still behold, While I tell the story, Springing arches, portals bold, Stretch out gaunt and hoary. In a vision fair and clear, Truly still I see them; Fairy!âI have held them dearâ Wherefore did I flee them? Silver white the moonbeams sleep On the almond thicket, Red as rust the sunbeams creep, Through the palace wicket. While the stork upon the roof Keeps unmov'd his station, And the swallow sits aloof From his habitation: And the linnet's throat is sweet, With his peers conferring, While at noonday in the heat Not a leaf is stirring: And the waters on their way Eddy round the cresses, And the whisp'ring reeds at play Bend to their caresses: Turrets bright with sunny airâ Hills above them swellingâ Forest-girdled stands the fair Spirit-haunted dwelling. But one lot must come to all Holding mortal station In the year is spring and fall, Changing and mutation! I awoke at dawn of day Once, and, round me glancing, I beheld the ancient Fay To my couch advancing. At my feet awhile she stood, Then, her mantle raising, Peer'd at me beneath her hood With a keen-ey'd gazing. Quoth she then, âBehold, I come On a thankless mission;â Nothing answer'd I, struck dumb By the wrinkled vision. âCome thou here, my dainty Sprite,â Quoth the ancient Fairy; And it fled on wings of light, Meteor-like and airyâ Flew to her â âGive back, give back,â Cried I, âstern despoiler!â Vainly might I pray, Alack! How could mortal foil her? Coldly did she turn away, Bearing off my treasure, Answer'd mine entreaties, âNay, Get thee to thy pleasure. There is sunshine on the grass, Check'd with light that quivers, There's a fountain smooth as glass Where the aspen shivers: Let the shadow of thy face Drop upon it, daughter, 'Tis a picture fair to trace On the dimpling water. âNay, be still, fond fool! good sooth! Vain is thine imploring, She who goes, must go! in truth There is no restoring: That I tell thee, lay to heartâ Better loss and dangersâ Troubled rest and aching heart Ne'er to thee be strangers; Better truly grief and pain In thy soul be swelling, Than (sweet Spirit!) she again Make with thee her dwelling! Oh! a second time, Princess! Ask not that, I pray thee! Alter'd form and chang'd caress Then might well affray thee!â From my chamber she did pass, Pass, and left me lonely; I look'd out, and on the grass Play'd bright sunbeams only: I went forth, but ne'er a bird Round about the palace Singing in the trees I heard, âWelcome, Princess Alice!â Oh! they sang at their âsweet will,â Goldfinch, thrush, and linnetâ Somewhat miss'd I natheless still, And I ne'er could win it. For some cadence sure was mute, Or had died and faded, That erewhile as woodland flute All the glens pervaded. The green people all the day Of their forms were chary, I heard not their laughter gay, Elf or prankish fairy: Prattling tongues and busy feet, They had all departed, Ne'er a straggler, me to greet, In the pathway started. Green the fern about me grew, In familiar places; And the cowslips, wet with dew, Bow'd their modest faces. From the palace of my birth, From each forest vista, Pass'd a somewhat of their worth With my heart's lost sister! In the wing'd and blue-ey'd Fay, Sweet enchantment centred; With her flight they fled away, And much sadness enter'd. In the sultriness of noon, And when shadows lengthen'd, In the broad light of the moon, Still my sorrow strengthen'd. In the hills where we did play Round each marble column, Whileâthe night to wile awayâ Music sweet and solemn Floated over all the place; And each burning eresset, Casting light on every face, Told that joy did bless it: When the lamp-flames many-hued Gleam'd throughout the palace, And with rainbow tints embued Silver cup and chalice, Marble walls and marble floor, Snowy waving curtain Shedding on them, white before, Gorgeous hues uncertain: And on glowing plants which, rang'd By the pillars, flourish'd, Dropp'd carnation tints that chang'd With the flame that nourish'dâ Opal shades, as movements light Of a robe might fan it, To descend on myrtle white, Balsam or pomegranate: When the moonbeams, pure and blue, With their rich light blended, And the high arch, gliding through, To the roof ascended,â Then lay sore at my heart's door Thoughts of her departedâ At the bitter words, âNo more,â Tears of sorrow started: Then, ah! then the blue-ey'd Sprite, And her winsome feigning, Being fledâfled laughter lightâ Frolic chang'd to plaining! âFairy of the snowy weeds, And the azure cincture, Hadst thou of red Foxglove seeds Seeth'd a magic tincture, As 'tis said thy folk of old Made for eyes of mortals, Wherewith touch'd they might behold Of your world the portals: Hadst thou in the mid-earth been, Felt the earthquakes heaving, And the fatal Sisters seen At their endless weaving: Heard the sad tale that, once told, Maketh dumb for pityâ Read the secrets of the old Hundred-gated city: Look'd upon the Sybil's page, Ere the flame she lighted, And beheld Medea's rage, By false Jason slighted: Heard by night fell Circe raise Magic songs of feigning, Threaded through the Cretan maze, Its black centre gaining: Nothing could thy lore avail To the utmost lavish'd; And thy magic arts must fail, To restore the Ravish'd! Yetâto gaze on her again (As my tale hath taught thee), Potent Fairy, I am fain, Therefore have I sought theeâ Through the forest, through the lea, Through the tangled wild-wood, For I know she dwells with thee, And her name isâChildhood!â So she ceas'd! Our little sister, Wond'ring, look'd her in the face, As her own she lifted up, and kiss'd her; Then resum'd her state with childish grace; Said more gravely than the case might meritâ âNo, she ne'er had seen the little Spirit: Never! never!â thus did she aver, âCame that fairy Sprite to dwell with her!â All her play-time (mournful saying!) She was left to sport alone, For the very bees were gone a-Maying,â The green linnets from the nest were flown. âSo in my old castles and my bower, Each by turn, I live, and tend a flower, Such as in the âtalking forestâ grew, Which I water with enchanted dew!â âThe grass walks are my dominionsâ Moats to keep my foes away; But that little Sprite, with downy pinions, Flutter'd ne'er across with me to play.â This she utter'd, as if half forgetful That it was but fabling:âor regretful So to think:âthen said, and clear'd her brow, âI will hear the elder Princess now.â Then I answer'dââMy condition Potent Fairy, you mis-state, I no Princess am, though by permission Of your grace, a rede I will relateâ Errant Minstrel, oft in minstrel fashion Sing I songs of warfare, love and passion, But you see, no glitt'ring crown I bear Such as true Princesses always wear. âCome back,âdays of ancient glory, Toilsome strife, then listless easeâ Feudal forests mingle with my story, The deep rushing noise of wind-rock'd trees. If my rhymes be rude, the clang of armour Takes their sweetness from them, Fairy charmer! Sway the sceptre well, and list my lays, I will tell a tale of ancient days.â I. A gentle Maiden walk'd alone within the deep green wood, And there she spied a fair white dove by savage hawks pursued; âNow come to me, thou hunted dove,â the gentle maiden said, âAnd find a shelter in my arms, to hide thy beauteous head.â The yellow belted bee Was at work beneath the tree, And the woodruffe nodded lightly on the bed! Then spake the Prince, where low he lay beneath the beechen tree, âThe maid that fain would save a bird will surely succour me.â He slowly turn'd his fainting limbs, and spake with mickle pain, And from his wounds the crimson blood came welling forth amain. And the cuckoo's note was clear, With the belling of the deer, And the cushats sang their madrigals again. âOh! for thy gentle pity's sake, I pray thee to me bring A draught to quench my raging thirst from yonder forest springâ For truly I was here waylaid, and wounded, as ye see, All by his treachery that is my deadly enemy!â In the castle far away Shone the mellow evening ray, And the milky corn was green upon the lea. She brought him water from the burn, and held it to his lips, She led him down to the hollow tree that in the deep well dips; She hied her away to her forest-home, and brought of her wheaten bread, She spread him a couch of the tufted heath, to pillow his weary head. In the twilight beetles flew Up against himâand the dew Dimm'd the stars that watch'd by night above his bed. âNow who be ye, so rudely lodg'd, with face so fair and mild?â âMy father is ranger of all the wild wood, and I am his only child!â She tended him so patiently, ten summer weeks and three, Till the leaves were thick beneath her feet, when she came to the beechen tree. By the castle far away Did the lifted banner play, And the russet corn was ripe upon the lea! âNow heed me well, thou luckless youthâso hie thee hence away, The hunters will come when the leaves are down, and peril 'twere to stay. I have but got one silver crown, my father gave it meâ And half I'll keep to be my own, and half I'll give to thee!â And the shallow trickling burn Wander'd on beneath the fern, And the leaves they made a murmur like the sea! Then up he rose on a harvest night, in moonlight broad and clear, While the mushroom sprung from the cold damp earth in forest pathways drear: âO Maid, this voice to faltering takes, a-praising of thy care, This heart can only leave behind a blessing and a prayer.â There was mourning far away, In the castle stern and grey, And a bitter sound of wailing and despair. Red berries on the thorn were ripe, and glisten'd wet with dew, Young lev'rets chas'd the falling leaves that down the hollows flew; The hay and the clover were not cut when low on the earth lay he, When he hied him away, the hazel nut was dropping from the tree! And the autumn wind's low strain, Sighing up through my refrain, Mourn'd the dreary days of winter yet to be! II. The prayers were said, the grave was made, the mourners wept the dead, But where was the prince to wear the crown, and reign in his father's stead? When the requiem notes down the long aisle swept, when the singer's voices were clear, There came a mourner with bended brow, and stood by the stately bier! Why so pale, my Ladye Queen? âAh!â she saith, âthe blows were keen, From the son of my dead lord is nought to fear!â âAnd who be ye?â quoth the Barons bold,ââthis foremost place to win? For none may stand at the king's right hand, but he that is next of kin!â He lifts his beaverâa welcome runs through the crowds that round him kneel, A long low murmur that mingles well with the prayer for the dead man's weal. Wherefore shrink, thou fair stepdame? Little dreameth he her name, Who with jewell'd fingers brib'd the dastard steel! âTo-morrow's sun,â quoth the knights, âat eve shall light thy crowning day, But where from thy father's alter'd face didst hide so long away?â Short answer then made the princely youthâto priest and peer spake he,â âThe quarry shelters in forest-brakes, and I trow they might shelter me! Didst thou tell the false, false tale, That made love, fair queen, to fail? Did they part, who never met againâthrough thee? In the Minster aisle, at dark midnight, they mourn'd the old king dead; They set the crown, at noonday bright, upon the young king's head! âHearken to me, my page,â quoth he, âtake horse without delay, Fly to the forest wherein I was hid, and speed as best you may.â With a wine cup in thy hand, Why, O widow'd queen, dost stand? Is it deadly?âwherefore cry, âalas, the day?â âThere shalt thou find in the deep, deep wood, a maiden fair to see, I charge thee, by the crown I bear on my head, to bring that maid to me!â On his courser good fast sped the page, adown the forest dell, Till he spied a maid, set in flick'ring shade, at the brink of the forest well! O she lifted up her face With a bashful woodland grace, As at sight of her he lighted from the selle. âAnd I greet thee well,â the young page said, âfor certes thou art sheâ And thou must come with me, fair maid,âthe prince hath sent for thee.â Fair Edla blush'd in gath'ring fear and wonder at that rede, âYoung sir,â quoth she, âthe prince I ne'er have seen in truth and deed.â Saith he, kneeling on his knee, âYet thou needst must come with me.â And she weeping, he up-rais'd her on his steed. So fast he sped, and led the maid within the castle hall, And much she blush'd the guests to see, and lords and ladies all. âHow fair she is,â quoth the Barons brave: âin sooth the fairest here, Though never a pearl her bosom deck, nor robe of minivere.â In the castle old and grey How the merry minstrels play! Yet from either eye she drops a glistening tear. Sweet Edla sigh'd, sweet Edla wept, and knelt upon her knee, And the high dames wonder'd her beauty bright and trembling mood to see: When as she knelt before the prince, she rais'd not her drooping eyesâ O had she done, I wot it would have wrought her much surprise. Through the many-tinted glass Doth a narrow sunbeam pass, Like a rainbow on her golden hair it lies. âO come to me, thou hunted dove,â the new-made monarch said, âAnd find a shelter in my arms, to hide thy beauteous head: And since thou once didst share thine all, a silver crown with me, I fain would shareâ'tis all I have,âa golden one with thee!â Through the forest far away How the wild wind swept that day, And the yellow leaves they danc'd beneath the tree. âIs that all?â our little sister Throned in her nest, replied; Like an echo still methinks I list her Baby accents, though division wide Parts us from that gardenâRailway thunder, Rushing engines rave the tall trees under, And the grass is trampled now, and brown, And the Elms are deadâthe Sumachs down! DEPARTING. We were twins, and orphans too, And side by side we play'dâ Our pleasures for ourselves we made, And truly they were few. They who gave us clothes and meat, Alas! no love bestow'd, Thus ours for each other flow'd, A narrow stream, but sweet! As double stars reveal'd by night Seem a far distant sun, So closely join'd their mingled light, On earth they are but oneâ And none can sayââhere this doth end, Or here the next begins,ââ So did our mingled spirits blend, Our double souls were twins. They said that there was gold to get Beyond the restless sea, And while we were but children yet, They parted thee and me. They talk'd of life but just begun, Of wealth and merchant's gain,â And we, in soul who were but one, For this they made us twain. We gaz'd into each other's eyes, But not a tear we shed: Touch'd with a cruel, chill surprise, Our hearts were dry and dead. A look half frighten'd, half forlorn, Her troubled eyes express'd; She took the ribbon she had worn, And hid it in my breast. A pledge of love, that simple dower, So frail is left me yet; Perhaps in that last bitter hour She thought I might forget. She stood among the grass and sedge, The light waves touch'd her feet, The boat came to the water's edge, I turn'd thine eyes to meet, And give thee one last kiss, my sweet Katharina! RETURNING. Doves were cooing on the thatch, And, as I onward press'd, I found a little mossy nest Built on the wooden latch. Woodbines twin'd the window o'er, And on its rustic frame I saw the letters of her name That I carv'd long before. I look'd withinâshe was not there The narrow room to graceâ Her wheel was silent, and her chair Stood empty in its place. I wonder'd why thou didst not meet Thy wand'rer on his way:â But daisies in the grass were sweet Above thy head that day. Thy love was like a linked chain That reach'd across the sea, But snapt asunder, when I fain Had drawn its end to me:â A sunbeam that at distance cheer'd That cold and dreary shore, But faded as my footsteps near'd The threshold of thy door! Asleep, asleep, then take thy rest, And since it needs must be, 'Tis well it troubleth not thy breast, That all is lost to me. Yes! all is lost, for who can tell How chang'd are moor and lake, For truly, though I lov'd them well, 'Twas only for thy sake. And what to me is English air, Or this mild autumn sun, Since the twin spirit is not there? Here am I still undone, For in the world I had but one Katharina! THE INDIAN CHIEF. The following circumstance is said to have taken place at the commencement of the American War:â A Red Indian, having found a young English officer wounded in the forest, took care of him and adopted him for his own. Afterwards finding, that though hopeless of return, the young man's thoughts were always with his father, he undertook a long and dangerous journey through the forest, following in the track of the retreating British troops; and having brought his young charge to within sight of their tents, took leave of him as related below. I âSon of the Stranger! hear my voice, eight moons their light have shed, Since in the chase I found thy trail, and follow'd where it led: I saw thee wounded on the earth with none to tend thee nigh, Where on a fallen tree thy head thou hadst laid down to die! II I found thee, e'er the tender grass had sprouted in the field, When chesnut leaves lay folded yet, each in its crimson shield: And now the Sumach rob'd in red flaunts in the autumn sun, And yellow leaves upon the lake float by us one by one. III If the chill night had sooner clos'd, or I had come too late, The pining wind through naked boughs alone had wail'd thy fate: And when the tardy leaves at length came forth to deck the place, Then carrion birds had lighted down on thy uncover'd face. IV Son of the Stranger! 'tis enoughâthe Red man boasteth not, Far hast thou wander'd with my tribe, like ours has been thy lot. Through the green spring thy languid foot was ever at my side, As strength return'd, we chas'd the deer through all the summer tide. V O sure of hand, I lov'd thee wellâI love thee yet the same, I envied not thy rifle's shot that never miss'd its aim: 'Twas not for this that through the wood, so far thy steps I led, Where matted leaves shut out this sun that shineth over-head. VI 'Twas not because my people saidââWhen was a white man true!â For well thy friendship I had prov'd, and well thy faith I knew; But that I saw that thou wert sad, when the Red chiefs were gay, For thinking of thy father's tent a thousand miles away. VII Hear me!âIn happier seasons past I had a warrior son, But now he hunts in other fields, and I must dwell alone: For thou whose presence on my grief a soft'ning veil had flung, Thou dost not choose the Red man's life, nor love the Red man's tongue. VIII When the round moon at dead of night shines on the frozen snow, My warrior leaves his spirit-home and seeks his place below: In troubled dreams I hear the sound of restless footsteps nigh: Idly they wander round my tentâfaintly in distance die. IX I start from slumber when I hear that sound remember'd well, But, ah! his spirit-footsteps leave no traces where they fell: No trail upon the yielding snow that lies all smoothly fair: I fain would followâhe hath fled! Ask of the night winds where. X Now when the sun shines warm and bright, I rise at dawn of day, When birds rejoice, and tender flowers bask in his cheering ray: But not the voice of singing birds to Me can gladness bring, When snow hath melted from the earth, and leaves break forth in spring. XI Lift up thine eyes across the lake, and scan the woods that lie, Heaving their rounded bulk to meet the pure transparent sky: Look wellâto them the setting sun his brightest hues hath lent, And yonder is thy people's camp, and there thy father's tent. XII Perhaps thy warriors round their fire but seldom talk of thee, And think not, coming through the wood thy long-lost form to see: Another now thy place may fill, and in the red field shine, Thy dog have learn'd to take his food from other hands than thine. XIII But there is One who coldly looks at yon departing sun, Who deems all beauty lost to earth, since thou, young Chief, art gone: Can find no balsam in the woods, though far his foot may roam, To heal the pain that in his heart hath made itself a home. XIV What though with visions of thy face thy Father's sleep is sweet, When morning dreams bring back the sound of thy returning feet: Alas! for hope, when he awakes, to find them all depart, Delusive echoes of the note that vibrates in his heart. XV Goâdry those tears the pale-fac'd chief hath not disdain'd to shed, And let him lay his hand again in blessing on thy head: Goâthat his heart may yet rejoice when birds at morning sing, When snow hath melted from the earth, and leaves break forth in spring. THE MINSTREL'S CURSE. TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF LUDWIG UHLAND. In olden times a castle uprais'd its front of pride, Seen far across the country, e'en to the ocean's side: A garden bloom'd around it, a perfum'd garland bright, Wherein sprang silver fountains in glitt'ring sheets of light. There, rich in lands and conquests, once reign'd, in haughty state, A king on whose dark forehead were rul'd the lines of hate; And what he thought was fury, and what he look'd a blow, And what he spoke was scourging, and what he wrote was woe. Once to this castle journey'd an honour'd minstrel pair, The one with golden ringlets, the other white of hair; And with his harp the old man sat on the barbed steed, Which, lightly by him walking, did his young comrade lead. Spake the elder to the youngerââBe well prepar'd, my son, Think on thy sweetest ballads, sing with thy richest tone: For pleasing and for paining, try all thy deepest art, For it to-day behoves us to move the king's hard heart. Already the two minstrels in those high halls are seen, On his throne sits the monarch, and at his side the queen: The king in fearful glory, like fiery Northern Lights, And mild the queen beside him, as moon of summer nights. He strikes his harp, the minstrelâhe strikes it wond'rous well, That richer, ever richer, the echoing measures swell: Then forth with heav'n-like sweetness the youth's clear voice out floats, Pure as if choral spirits were mingling in the notes. They sing of love and springtide, the golden age of youth, Of holiness and freedom, of manhood's worth and truth: Sing of each sweet emotion through human heart that strays, Sing of each lofty passion that human heart can raise. The circling crowd of courtiers forebore the scornful jest, Some thought of grace unwonted surpris'd each warrior's breast: The queen drew forth, impassion'd with grief and joy so sweet, The rose-bud from her bosom, and threw it to his feet. The king cried out in fury, and shook with passion's strifeâ âYour spells seduc'd my peopleâand dare they touch my wife?â He seiz'd his sword and hurl'd it against the stripling's side, In lieu of song the life-blood stream'd forth, a ruddy tide. As by a tempest scatter'd, the list'ners backward press'd, The youth breath'd out his spirit upon his master's breast: He flung his mantle round him, upright in dreary state, Upon his horse he set him, and left with him the gate. But back towards the portal he turn'd, that minstrel grey, He seiz'd his harp whose echoes had scarcely died away: Against a marble column the priceless shell he flung, Then cried, till through the castle his fearful warning rungâ âWoe unto you, proud portals, no more shall tuneful string Sound sweetly through those chambers, nor minstrel in them sing, No sounds be there but mourning, while clanging feet shall fly, Till crush'd by vengeful spirits in ruin'd heaps they lie!â âWoe to thee, perfum'd garden, fair in the light of Mayâ Here by this face death-pallid, I swear to thee today That for this cause must vanish thy fountain's ceaseless flow, And thee a stony desert shall future seasons know. âWoe to thee, vile assassin! AccursÃ¨d be thy name, In vain is all thy striving for crowns of bloody fame: Thy name shall be forgotten, in endless darkness veil'd, Be like the last death-rattle, to empty night exhal'd!ââ This hath the minstrel spokenâand this the heavens have heard, The walls lie low, the pillars fall ruin'd at his word: To tell of vanish'd splendour one column decks the plain, But sorely rent and shatter'd, it shall not long remain. Where stood the blooming garden, lies waste deserted land, For there no tree drops shadow, no fount springs through the sand: The name of that king liveth in neither book nor verse, All sunken, all forgottenâThis was the Minstrel's Curse!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCRIPTURE POEMS. HANNAH. PART I. âI am a woman of a sorrowful spirit.ââ1 Sam. i. 15. âWhy weepest thou? Why dwells that gloom upon thy gentle brow, When here with clouds of fragrant incense rise The morning and the evening sacrifice, And God, our fathers' God, accepts my vow? Why, in the shadow of His holy place, Who so doth bless our race, That from the highest Heav'n He doth descend His gracious ear to lend, That He doth stoop from the eternal hills And their desire fulfils, Who seek the curtain'd footstool of His throne; Is not His will made known? Go to His shrine and leave thy sorrow there, The God of Israel waits to answer prayer. The place is holy ground, Angelic messengers its gates surround; But not upon their sinless wings are borne The broken pleadings that from earth ascend, The groans, the tears, the sighsâ Sighs of the oppress'd, complaints of the forlorn. He who with manna once our fathers fed, And through the wilderness their footsteps led To this their promis'd land, Did not, albeit their sins provok'd him sore, His gracious presence from their tribes withdraw. He trusts no angel hand To take the blessings that from Heaven's gate flow And scatter them belowâ No angel voice to be his delegate And bring him tidings of his people's state; Not to an angel's ear Doth He entrust man's feeble vows to hear. Hidden from mortal ken He heareth, shadowing the mercy-seat, The prayers that sorrow poureth at his feet, For his delights are with the sons of men. âImmortal and invisible, He yet On the frail dust of earth His love hath setâ Holy of Holies, he doth not despise The praises that from sinful voices riseâ Why weepest thou? In spring the stream that pours down bursting tides In summer gently glides; But my love in a changeless current runsâ Am not I better to thee than ten sons? Why weepest thou?â âBy night I slept and in my dream Peninnah me did greet, Methought a clod of earth she held, and dropp'd it at my feet, And lo! the clod of earth wax'd great, and spread from side to side, Till far it stretch'd beyond my view, a desert drear and wide. âMethought across its arid plains with restless foot I went, Nor wandering cloud nor frowning rock a welcome shadow lent; Methought I knew not what I sought as still I onward hied, Nor why so long contented stray'd from thy beloved side. â'Twas but a dream, and yet the sun beat down with scorching ray, The earth was hot beneath my feet, I could not get away; When suddenly a stately tree from out the desert grew, And spread abroad its branches light, its green leaves wet with dew. âA stately tree, and while I gaz'd with wonder and surprise, A fountain bubbling from the earth sprang up before mine eyes, So near the trunk, that o'er its source the tree its shadow flung, And in the waters clear and cold its verdant branches hung. âHard by the widely spreading roots that little fountain stray'd, As fain to linger near the tree for which alone it play'd; Then wand'ring forth I watch'd its course that glitter'd in the light, 'Till, swallow'd by the treach'rous sand, it vanish'd from my sight. âNo waving reed nor desert herb its barren margin grac'd, Across the bare and thankless plain its waters ran to waste; The sheltering tree that o'er it droop'd drank of the flowing tide, No sapling rising from its root the lonely rill supplied. âI woke, the tears were on my cheek: the tinkling of the rill, The wind's low murmur in the tree, methought I heard them still: Alas! the lightning's stroke at length must lay the proud tree low, Would that the little fount might then for ever cease to flow! âThou art that lofty branching tree, for strength and beauty made, And I the rill that had its source beneath the spreading shade; Fresh from the well-spring of my heart it bounds, a silvery tide, That fain would still reflect thy face and linger at thy side. âO sheltering tree, with goodly boughs, beneath whose shade I live, I weep because no other pledge of love I have to give. No tender saplings I have rear'd to flourish in thy stead, When thou laid prostrate in the vale shalt bow thy lofty head. âThou didst behold my friendless youth and draw me to thy heart, Thou hast a father's loss supplied, and done a brother's part: Thou didst the orphan'd maiden's cup e'en to o'er-flowing fill, The childless wife from thee receives a goodly portion still! âI love thee, yet no gift can bring to offer at thy shrine, If fain I would some portion yield, all that I have is thine. For me thou dost arise betimes and pay thy vows to Heavenâ All this and more I have receiv'd, but nothing have I given! âNo blooming babe with artless tongue I to thine arms can bring, I have not got that best of gifts to be mine offering. She does not love thee more than I, whose children climb thy kneeâ O, that my father's God would grant that long'd-for gift to me! âPeninnah's daughters in her room shall rise, her name to bless, Her children's children round her cling, to crave her proud caress. Peninnah's sons upon her tomb shall shed their filial tears, Her honour'd name shall live with thine, through all succeeding years. âBut I the history of my love must unrecorded leaveâ When my place knoweth me no more, who shall remain to grieve? No future times shall link with thine my life, my hopes, my fears, And they who see my tomb shall give no sighs, no love, no tears.â âWhy weepest thou?â Those low words sooth'd her, as she went to bow With thoughtful spirit at the holy place, And sunset clouds reflected in her face Their own bright hue. She thought upon her vow, And a faint hope into her heart did stray, That He who bids men pray, Would not unheeded leave her humble cry, Vouchsafing no reply. By purple veil, by crimson canopy, Meekly she bent her knee, Pouring her soul out till the glow of day Melted to dusk away, And lighted lamps God's hallow'd place display'd, To her who at its outmost portals pray'd. âHoly of Holies, veil'd in light too pure for mortal eyes, Before whose throne doth Israel's prayer like fragrant incense rise, I know thy mighty actions past and all thy book foretells, And fear to come too near the place wherein thine honour dwells! âGod, who from lofty Lebanon, dost melt the winter snows, Who mak'st the barren wilderness to blossom as the rose, Who from the smitten rock didst pour floods on the desert sand, And cause the clouds to rain down food on an unfruitful landâ âIs anything too hard for Thee, that mortal lips can crave? Thou who to childless Sarah erst our father Isaac gave, I know without thy high behest on earth is nothing done: Since life and death are in thy handâOh! give to me a son! âThou art acquainted with my ways, far off as well as near; And her reproaches who hath caus'd my sorrow, thou dost hear: Thou mark'st the windings of my path, each step my foot hath trod, Wilt thou not look upon my tears? O God! my father's God! âI know that when Messias comes for whom the nations wait, The Prince whose sceptre shall prevail to raise our fallen stateâ He shall for all the sons of men a perfect offering make, I pray thee then accept my vow for thine Anointed's sake. âIf on my grief thou wilt indeed look down with pitying eye, And grant the boon my spirit craves, the long'd-for gift supply: Soon as the child can lisp thy praise, thy glorious name adore, I will return him, in thy courts to serve for evermore. âHim from my bosom I will spare, will rear him for thy shrine, Contented soon to give him up and feel that he is thine, Myself will teach him that with thee 'tis better to abide, Will wean his love away from me and lead him from my side. âIf, when in future years I come to seek thy holy place, He should unconscious turn away, forgetful of my face; And ne'er return the tender love that must surround him still, I will not murmur nor complainâonly, my prayer fulfil!â âWhy weepest thou?â In different tones the words were utter'd now To those that on her meek attentive ear Her husband pour'd to dry her starting tear, Striving her suffering spirit to endow With the calm thoughts that in his tranquil breast Had taken up their rest. Nor like His voice who in the garden spoke, When on his empty tomb the day-light broke, Where Mary wept in loneliness of soul, 'Till to her heart his pitying accents stole, Chasing away the anguish from her brow With his lov'd words, âWoman, why weepest thou?â Reproachfully they fell, Those cold harsh tones, and scarcely could she tell What they might mean, so startlingly that came To check her pleadings and her tears to blameâ âWhy weepest thou before the holy shrine? Put far from thee thy wine: Wilt thou the temple of thy God profane? Go, seek thy home again: May His insulted love who dwells within, Forgive thee this thy sin.â Meekly she answer'd him; For in the clear thin twilight, soft yet dim, She mark'd the priestly garb, the silver hair; And rising from her prayer, Parted the dark locks that upon her face Had fallen like a veil. 'Twas strange disgrace That such suspicion on her head should rest, Troubling her modest breast. âLet not my lord mistake, Chide not thine handmaid for her weeping's sake; I am a woman sorrowful in heart, Unwilling from the holy shrine to part; In the abundance of my bitter grief Here did I seek reliefâ And in the silence that His walls afford, Have poured out my soul before the Lord.â And he said âGo in peace, Thy father's God grant thee a full release, Bless thee according to His bounteous will, And thy request fulfil.â PART II. âMy heart rejoiceth in the Lord.ââ1 Sam. ii. 1. The daylight broke, The child was sleeping, but the mother woke; Then darkness fled, and, trembling still afar, Hung in the ruddy east the morning star; A fleeting thing, of midnight hours that spoke, One of her gems that Night had left behind, When, restless like the wind, Spreading her dusky wings she fled away, Shunning the face of day, And cowering sunk beyond the reach of dawn, On western plains forlorn. The sky grew brighter and the Temple hymn, Begun in twilight dim, Still softly echo'd in the balmy air, When the first sunbeam touch'd the house of prayer. The morning star shrunk in, Lost in the light, with all its radiant kin. But few had mark'd it in the glowing skies:â To toil or pleasure risen, the busy throng Crowding the narrow pathways press'd alongâ The blessed sun was welcome to their eyes New wak'd, and thoughtful for their daily lot, They dwelt no more on blessings needed not To crown their opening dayâ Of peaceful rest did no glad record keep, But let remembrance of their quiet sleep Fade with the star away. But she beheld, that watcher calm and mild Beside her sleeping childâ She saw it sink into the glowing sky; And still he woke notâthough the time drew nigh, The time to give him upâher first-born sonâ The darling of her heartâher only one. Yet 'twas for this she sought him, when with tears She came in other years, With trembling heart by long reproaches worn, And fears conflicting tornâ Yet 'twas for this she rear'd himâthis delay'd Her yearly offering, erst in Shiloh paid; And now rejoicing, to its portals bound, She brought the blessing that her prayer had crown'd. Her hope fulfill'dâher promise unforgot, She came and linger'd not. The level sunbeams lighted on the place Where still he slumber'd in his child-like grace; She came and laid her hand upon his head, And softly thus she said:â âSleep on while yet beside thy couch her watch thy mother keeps, There is a Guardian of thy rest, who slumbers not nor sleepsâ Sleep on, though morning's early light across thy curtain beams, Thy mother's voice perhaps no more shall mingle with thy dreams. âI would within thy child-like heart there yet might rest a trace Of distant fields, of early home, and of thy father's face; And loving thoughts of me, my son, might ever there remain Among the few things left of earth, that it might yet retain. âBut if such thoughts might wean thy heart from Him thou serv'st above, Ah! then forget thy father's face, forget thy mother's love; Forget Mount Ephraim's hoary head, where mists and vapours meet, Forget his forest-cumber'd heights and vineyard-trellis'd feet. âAs birds their helpless offspring tend with never-wearied care, Search for their sake the gloomy woods and skim the pathless air; And then, their spreading pinions grown, deserting, give them o'er, Forsaken, through the upper fields alone to sing and soarâ âSo have I tended theeâbut now my work of love is done, And I must leave thee to His care who feedeth them, my son. I must forsake, though not forgetâto thee 'tis given to rise Now, like the birds, desert thy nest, and seek thy kindred skies. âWhat though forgetfulness should come, to blot me from thy breast, In spirit still thy mother's hand upon thy head may rest. Lift up thy heart to thy true home, thy Father's house above, Thou that art mine no more to keep, but still my own to love!â Among the gathering throng With the new-waken'd child they pass'd along; Soon at the shrine of God, in faith drawn near, With offering and oblation to appear. The parting hour the father's heart oppress'd, But peace had visited the mother's breast. With loving eyes that wander'd o'er his face, Gently she led him to the Holy place, And brought him where, the daily offering made, The aged priest before the altar stay'd. Meekly and quietly her tale she told: âLet thy soul live!âBehold! I am the woman that stood by thee here, And pray'dâmy God to me bow'd down his ear. Here I my prayer and my petition made, And for this child I pray'd. âMy heart rejoiceth in the Lord, who doth exalt my head, My mouth is fill'd with praise, and low in dust my foes are laid; In thy salvation I rejoice, thy holy works I see, Beside thee there is none, O God! nor any rock like thee. âThou only refuge in despair, and succour in distress, To thee with earnest thanks I come thy faithful name to bless; O let the offering of my hand be pleasant in thine eyes; Thou God who didst receive my vow, accept my sacrifice. âFather I bring thee back thine own, and here forgiveness crave, If once thy gift had well-nigh won my heart from thee who gave. O let such wish be mine no more to keep the child awhile, To keep him from his Father's courts, and from his Father's smile. âO, hope of Israel! what is this that like a dream doth rise, This vision faintly shadow'd forth that floats before mine eyes; Sing in your spheres, ye sons of God,âthou earth, arise and shine, A woman to these courts shall bring, a greater gift than mine! âMy son, for whom with bitter tears I wept and wrestled long, I leave thee, record of my vow, and witness of my song; Through life, for thee, by prayer obtain'd, I'll lift my voice in praise; Walk thou in all thy Father's laws, and love his holy ways. âFor thou wilt need no mother's care, nor mother's fond caress, The God who gave thee, will protectâwho takes thee back, will bless. Now on the threshold of thy home thine infant foot hath trod, I bring thee where I sought thee firstâI leave thee with thy God!â So did she singânow lost and past away Is the pure shrine to which she came to pray; Now from its courts no songs of praise ascend, Nor tribes of worshippers towards it tend. God! who once dwelt with man on Shiloh's plain, When wilt thou raise it from the dust again? That song of praise no echo finds belowâ Sad tears of sorrow flow From them who worship there, who wail and fast, Weeping and mourning for its glory past. But in a purer temple rear'd afar Beyond the morning star, A place prepar'd, the glory of all landsâ A house not made with handsâ Is mingling sweetly with their sacred mirth The song of triumph she began on earth, When first her God upon her sorrow smil'd: Its notes are echoed on that peaceful shore, Where long ago they met to part no more, The mother and her child. THE DEATH OF MOSES ON MOUNT NEBO. And Moses was alone: his foot had pass'd For ever from the haunts of men, his eyes Had look'd their last upon the tented plain! The mountain battlements, its ribs of stone Were round about him, the eternal rocks Savage and wild rear'd up their barren spires, And shrouding vapours, like a billowy main, Heav'd their dim masses up against his seat, And hid the warm earth from his yearning soul. Unheard of him the voice of weeping rose From the forsaken multitudeâunseen Amid the sunbeams far beneath his feet Hung in a floating veil of fragrance pure The incense of the evening sacrifice! He sate alone: and he said, âHere am Iâ Lord God of Israel, on the mountain hoar, Shut out from sight and from communion sweet With them that are my fellowsâI am come To meet with Thee, Invisible! sustain Death all unveil'd to thought, by passion dimm'd Or slow decay, or lengthen'd pilgrimage. O Thou Eternal! How shall I sustain Thy terrors manifold, Thy voice endure, Uncloth'd upon, unshelter'd by this frame? How shall I see Thy face, nor fall away, Appall'd with light, beyond the utmost star, And shrink into the nothing whence I came? âYet, if Thou wilt be gracious, if Thine ear Is to my voice attent, and if my soul Be written in Thy Book,âby all Thy care, The cloudy pillar, whereby Thou didst guide Thy people journeying through this wildernessâ By the dropp'd manna round about their tents, And by the smitten rockânay moreâby all, Favour laid up for cycles unreveal'd, Wrapp'd in the dusk of yet unfolded Timeâ Give me this tokenâbreathe away these clouds Which hide the green earth's bosom; let me see Blue Jordan wind,âon his desirÃ¨d shores Behold the land forbidden to my foot, The glorious land where Thou wilt set Thy Name, The heritage of Israel!â Then arose The slumb'ring breeze, and pin'd among the caves And hollows of the rockâthen swept the sea Of floating vapours upward, till display'd, As by the rending of a snow-white veil, The smiling land beneath them lay reveal'd: Green, silent, glowing in the sunset gleams It spread into the distance, waving fields And valleys yellow with the ripening corn, And vineyards on the hills, and forests thick The mountain sides ascending. Farther yet Stretch'd the wide landscapeâto the swelling ridge Of Lebanon with all its cedars crown'd, To plains Sidonian and the Tyrian shore, To the blue borders of the utmost sea. And Moses saw with eyes undimm'dâbeheld The winding river, near whose rushy marge The tribes by number lay,âwith morning dawn To cross the tide:âAnd from his heart a pray'r Ascended for their weal;âfor he had known Their weakness,âhe had pleaded for them long, And in his spirit echoed still the sound Of mourning, that grew fainter and more faint, As up the mountain side that day he came, Knowing his hands which he had lifted up, For evermore had ceas'd from blessing Israel. The Prophet gaz'dâbut not with earthly eyes Alone, though earthly eyes of age undimm'd Receiv'd the wondrous visionâto his soul Futurity came forth, and lent her hues, Her glories and her unimagin'd woes, To the far-spreading plains and swelling hills. And Moses saw upon the lofty rocks Of Zion, a fair city rise and lift Her pinnacles and domes: around them drawn Towers of defence, and battlements of pride: And he beheldâtill in her midst arose The temple of the Lordâits golden gatesâ Those walls whereon no tool was lifted up, Its portals fill'd with waiting multitudes He sawâand with its glory was content; The cedar-roofâthe vessels of pure goldâ The Ark o'ershadow'd with mysterious wingsâ While in the courts without, for ever rose, With praise of ministering Levites sung, The smoke of victims slain, towards the skies. And Moses saidââThe Lord accept thy vows, Thou mighty nation, and increase thy stores.â And he beheld again, and underneath The Holy place, in darken'd chambers dim, Stood symbols of unholy things, and names Of unclean spiritsâIsis, with the moon Her shadowy crescent, on her forehead set, Weeping her lost Osiris, and the sign Of great Astarte, the Assyrian's queen, And Hera with her silver snakes,âthe names Of all the hosts of Heavenâand nigh them burn'd Offering of incense, and the priests of God Stood, ev'ry man his censer in his hand. And Moses bow'd his face upon his hands, And sigh'dââO Lord, forgive!ââAnd he beheld The riches of his nationâflocks and herds Unnumber'd for their multitude, and corn And wine and oil and precious woods and goldâ But as he look'd, behold they took thereof, And fashion'd golden calves, and set them up, And all the tribes went forth to worship them! Then he beheld the Prophets going forth With signs and wonders, yet they heeded not, But multiplied their idols in the groves, Crying, and stretching out their hands on high, âO Baal, hear us!ââAnd he lifted up His voice, and wept. Again the vision wax'd Distinct: encamp'd between the distant hills, And from the mountain masses gathering, Chariot and horseman and a mighty host With gleaming spears, and flashing swords appear'd; Against the Holy City they came forth, And as the changes of a dream, so came Swift changes over it; the goodly towers Before them fell, the massy gates gave way, Its glorious beauty was laid waste, its pride Soil'd in the dust, its riches all despoil'd, And alien hands from the most holy place Tore down its carvÃ¨d work of cedar, laid Rude hands upon its fretted gold, and bore Its sacred vessels to a heathen shrine! And Moses saidââDeliver them, O Lord, For yet they are Thy people!â Then there fell A shadow over Canaan;âindistinct And dim the vision seem'd, with sighs confus'd Of war, and trouble of contending tribes, Of oracles forgotten, and of sins Crying for vengeance!âThe fair city stood Fair as of old, on the eternal hills, And from its sacred courts ascended still Incense and off'ring:âbut no longer hung The cloud within its precincts, and the voice That spake between the Cherubim was dumb. Dimness hung over all, and disbelief Spread brooding like a canopy, to shut The sight of Heav'n, and steep the pray'rless crowd In its unhallow'd air;âthere was a sound Of scoffing, that spake coldly unreprov'dâ âWhere is the promise of His coming?âLo! All things continue fix'd and bound of old!â And Moses criedââO lost and sunk too low For thought to fathomâO cold worshippersâ O foolish nation, mockers vain, what care, What remedy can reach to heal them now?â And as he spake, ONE lifted up His voice, And cried, till far and near the mountains shookâ The dimness fled away, âDeliver them, For I have found a ransom!â After pause, The Prophet lifted up his face, to look Upon the dread Messiah, on the King Of mighty Israel,âbut behold, no king, No conqueror went forth, no ruler sway'd The sceptre of his people, but ONE stood Upon a mountain, and they brought to Him The lame, the maim'd, the blind, and on them laid He holy hands, and they were whole. His face Was calmer than th' eternal vaulted sky, His brow majestic, more than earthly soul Of earth alone could stamp it, and His words Pass'd human reach of tenderness; He cried, And the green hills of Canaan echo'd long The love-begotten strainââCome unto Me All ye that labour and are heavy-laden, And I will give you rest!â Most blessÃ¨d sound, And happy day, most favour'd company! So long he gaz'd, as one who once forlorn, Finds assur'd peace and safety without end! Then the bless'd vision chang'd, and he beheld The God-Man under waving palm-boughs high Down-riding to Jerusalem, around, And in his train a countless multitude, Crying âHosanna,â and with garments rich, And leaves his pathway strewing, but no look Of triumph mark'd he on Messiah's face, But rather in the vision, wondrous pain His aspect dimm'd, a burd'ning weight of woe, And a foreshadow'd agony; strange thoughts, Deep wond'ring, flash'd upon the Seer's soul With chill'd misgiving, but he cast away That pang, and cried âWhat faithless questioning, Soul, hath beset thee? as if He who comes To reign, could find usurpers on His throne, Or finding, could not hurl them with the strength Of His right hand, to outermost perditionâ Should He, if haply could rebellion rise (Which yet methinks it could not)âshould He reign The less, or suffer damage? Nay! His throne He shall establish, in the pleasant land He shall teach peace! Methinks ev'n now a voice Speaketh within me thus: âThy throne, O God, Is, and shall be for ever,â God and Man, Vision most sure, though future, yet distinct,â Who shall be, and shall hear Hosannas gladâ I pray Thee, in Thy day remember me, Though cover'd in the dust: nay, though my voice From dust Hosannas cannot cry, look back Into the pastâbehold! upon this rock, I dying lift Hosannas to Thy nameâ Look backâand in the dust, remember me!â But while he spake, a deeper shadow fell Upon the hills of Canaan, and a veil Of dimness, greater than had e'er before Hung brooding on the city, compass'd it: Dark, dark the scene, and trembling seiz'd the soul Of him who gaz'dâconfus'd and broken sounds, With intervals of horror and of fear, Came like accusing spirits to his seat, And ever and anon athwart the gloom, While the earth trembled and the stars went in, Flash'd momentary visions of One crown'd With thorns, and cover'd with a purple robe, Thus mockingly ador'd. So still he gaz'd Faint with a dying hope. He look'd, and lo! In murky darkness hung the victim Christ, The Hope of Israel! Hope vain now indeed And forfeit past redemptionâlook'd and saw His own, reviling, and the heathen's spear Wound his expiring frame! He died! The Seer beheld, and bow'd his head, Crying âUndone, undone!â The clouds came up Veiling the fields of Canaanâon the Mount They rose and shrouded Him in darkness deep And fearful, as the darkness of his soul! And he said, âO my Nation, whom I led With painful steps athwart this wilderness, Whose gain of this green land hath made it light To me, no foot upon its fields to setâ Is all then lost? Yea, hast thou slain thy King? Who now shall plead for pardon? God, my God, Let me not dieâor let this vision fadeâ Erase it from my soul that thus I saw Godhead dissever'd from Humanity! I know my sins were present at that deed, The tempter spirits cry it in mine ears: They rise, they witness! O! to die, to die, With this new guilt upon my spirit, spareâ Yet wherefore spare? nay, lift thy hand, and strike, For I have slain the Lord of Glory! Strike! God, I submit, entreating not, I bare My forehead to the blow! How didst thou die, Messiah! Prince! Thou didst not cry nor strive. âAs a man falleth before wicked men, So fellest thou!â Alas! this dimness grows, It covers me! O Death, how dark thou artâ O God, how far from me! The clouds are round, Above, about me! I am left alone! Egypt, thy days of darkness had a hope That made them lightsome, to this gloom compar'd! Eternal! Whom I talk'd with face to face, Unconscious of this crime which blindeth hopeâ If from the deeps of blackness thou wilt hear, If there be hope in darkness to be feltâ Here I beseech thee, as I once besought With mortal eyes thy glory to behold, Show me thy Love, O God, before I die!â âOne transfigur'd! In the cloud Wherefore dost thou stand, With a golden censer in thy hand? Folded in his shroud, Saw I one like thee entombÃ¨d lie, Having breath'd out his soul in strife and agony! âWho art thou, Lord? On thy brow, as from the dead restor'd, Godhead and Manhood meet, Print of nails is on thy hands and feetâ Who art thou, Lord? I know thee not, yet dimly I divine, If one from death could rise, That thou art He! From beneath thy feet the thunders roll, Love immortal beameth from thine eyes, Foreshadow'd mercies shine In the glory that enshroudeth thee! Art thou the Love of God? and dost thou stand Lifting thy wounded hand, Interceding for my guilty soul? Didst thou, tabernacled in this clay, Breathe upon the cross thy life away? Then, of thy great fulness to me giveâ Let me, by thy dying, live! âLove of God! and dost thou not upbraid, Though the shadow of a thorny crown Doth never from thy forehead fadeâ Though for sin of man the awful frown Of wrath, on thee came downâ Though among thine own betray'd, Dost thou live again, and intercede? Then is not hope extinctâ Since in brotherhood with manhood link'd Thou dost stand before the throne, Unoppress'd with splendour like thine own, Unamaz'd with light, before Him plead For Adam's fall'n seed! Yea, I hear a voice within, Saying, âKnow, O man, thy sin, God's free bounty shall not countervail, Greater than their lost estate through Me shall mortals win: Be accusing spirits henceforth dumb, Minist'ring angels cry âAll hail!â Lo, I come!â âVision, ere thy day reveal'd, I see thy reign ariseâ Wond'rous Love! I know thou wilt despise Shame and spitting, for the promise seal'd By the oath of Him who cannot lie, âThrough thy death shall death and sorrow die!â Thou hast many crowns upon thy head, Greatly shall thy kingdom spread, Many waters flow beneath thy feet, At thy throne, O God, shall gath'ring nations meet. âLonger needeth not delayâ Love of God, take now my life away! I am ready! let this breath Fade into desirÃ¨d death! Yea! and those at my withdrawal weeping, Lo! I leave them to thy keeping! Greater love thou hast than mine. Will their welfare.âLove divine, Overbear their sin, their spirits save, Let thy will upraise them from the grave, Let them waken to thy praise, Glorious from their slumber in the dustâ Soul and body leave I to thy trust, Till the ending of the days! Nigh their tents the waves of Jordan swell, They shall cross the stream with dawning lightâ I shall be with Thee this night, And for both shall all be well! âComest Thou nearer? yet more near? Perfect love doth cast out fear! Draw my spirit with thy beck'ning hand, For mine eyes have seen thy promis'd land, From the weary clay my soul releaseâ I would enter into peace!â And Moses died. The moon was bright above, The plain was still! but on the mountain head, Unwitness'd of the sleeping multitudes, Was warfare such as Spirits wage, and strife That shook its rugged sides. Up from the earth Where night was thickest, even from the midst Of Israel's tents, rose out a clouded Form Most like material Darknessâwander'd forth Throughout the camp, and folded evil wings Across a thunder-ruin'd countenance. Slowly, as one asham'd, wherever shades Lay deep, the fall'n Greatness took its way, And up the dark side of the mountain came E'en to its hoary summitâstanding forth At length in the clear light, with hopeless eyes Fix'd on the sleeping saint. But e'er the touch Of the lost Spirit could defile that clay, Swift as a sunbeam, purer than the light, One from above descendedâthunder roll'd And shook the plain; the pale blank moon went in, And darkness veil'd the Spirit-Combatantsâ The mountain quak'd, and ever downward roll'd The rifted rocks. The sleepers in the camp Awoke and pray'd: but Israel's tribes beheld Nor gleaming spear nor fiery flashing sword: Nor heard by mortal anger, all unmov'd, The heav'nly Angel's pure and stern reproof, âThe Lord rebuke Thee!â THE SHUNAMITE. PART I. âAnd he said, âWherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.â And she said, âIt shall be well!âââ2 Kings, iv. 23. âIt shall be well!â She sent and answer'd him ââIt shall be wellââ E'en though her heart o'erfraught With love and agony and burning thought, With all a mother's bitter grief might swell, She sent and answer'd him, âIt shall be well!â What could that message mean? It did not tell how death had come between Him and the joy of harvest; could there rest Still in her heaving breast Hope that the child would waken? that his head Would turn upon the pillow of that bedâ When the light air came in, that he would sighâ Feeling it lift his hair so wooingly?â No! for she left him: for she left alone The silent form, from which the life was flown:â Who the deep workings of her soul may tell? Mysterious words! she said, âIt shall be well!â What shall be well? His aged father's heart, when he shall call For his sweet child? when turn'd at even-fall To his own roof, from fields with harvest white, No foot shall meet him in the soft dim light, But he shall hear the mourning women's cry Of death and desolation? and his eye Shall fall upon the face for which they wail? No! for it shall be pale! What then? thy gentle heart, kind Shunamite? No! for thy sole delight Hath sobb'd himself to sleep upon thy breast, His dreamless sleep. Then let him take his rest! Long did thine arms in hope his limbs enfold, But now they have grown cold! Who sitteth in the mount apart? his gaze, Dream-like, upon the far blue landscape staysâ Green slopes and harvest fields and pastures fairâ But his thoughts are not there! Across the darken'd mirror of his soul Thick mists obscuring roll: And as, when Eli had laid down to sleep, In midnight silence deep, Before the ark the lamp of God burn'd dim Shaded with golden wings of Cherubimâ So in the temple of his heart, though nigh Might Angel-watchers in his pathway lie, No gleams of light with radiance pure and sweet Reveal'd the brightness of the Mercy-seat: As in the hour of midnight gloom, with him The lamp of God burn'd dim! Haply prophetic visions, indistinct With wailing voices sounds of trouble link'dâ Haply a shadowing forth of wasting years, Captivity and tears, To come upon his nation, or yet more, It might be that before His inward sense the âMan of Sorrowsâ rose, And to him wond'ring did the wounds disclose, That pierc'd his hands and feetâhis soul might see, Shadows of that last night's deep agony; Might see One lowly in the garden bendâ And words of wond'rous meaning might extend To him that search'd what tidings these might bring, Fore-runners of what pure and holy thingâ Yes! to his soul might reach that bitter cryâ âWhat, is it nothing, O ye passers by?ââ âNothing to you these thorns?âThis cursed tree?â BeholdâBehold and see If there be any sorrow like to mine?â Man's guilt and wrath Divine!â Or haply on his burden'd soul might press The world's dull caresâits wants, its wearinessâ He hath no fellowâthere are none to feel Like woes with his, and by communion heal. The idol-worshippers wax strong and bold, And love hath long grown cold. What wonder if his voice hath sorrow's tone? He in the midst hath dwelt so long alone: Or to his lips low pining words may come, Looking and longing for his distant home! âO that I had wings! Then would I flee away and be at restâ I would betake me to the utmost springs That in the desert rise, and calm my breast Beside their lonely waters; I should hear, About their margins drear, No hymns to Baal chanted, but above The sky would smile upon me, and my soul Freed from earth's strong control, And thought that fondly clings Around forbidden things, Should find a purer outlet for her loveâ O that I had wings Like a dove!â âO that I had wings, I would escape from stormy winds away And tempests,âfrom the pain that scoffing brings, The strife of tongues, from mumbling crowds that pray By flames unhallow'd, from the weary pain That frets me for the nation that I love, From warnings long unheard and teachings vain: I would betake me to a quiet shore Where billows heave no moreâ Would touch the golden strings Whereto the Seraph singsâ I would escape unto the courts aboveâ O that I had wings Like a dove!â PART II. âAnd she said to her servantââDrive and go forwardâ slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.ââ2 Kings, iv. 24. So she went on the man of God to meet, And pour her bitter tidings at his feet: And when he saw her on the mountain's height, He said, in pity for her toilsome wayâ âBehold nowâyonder is that Shunamiteâ I pray thee, run to meet her stepsâand sayâ SayââIs it well with thee? And with thy husband well?âand with the child?ââ What should her answer be? She saidââIt is wellââbut was unbeguil'd By hope,âshe bow'd her to grief's strong control, And in her patience she possess'd her soul! And he saidââWhat is this?â Hath God to tears of mourning turn'd her bliss?â Let her alone; Her soul is vex'd within her, but the Lord No tidings doth afford Of this her grief to me!âHis goodness shone Erewhile upon her head; the bitter moan Of woe was far from her in days of oldâ Now, He afflicteth her with all his waves; But me He hath not told: The voice of joy is flownâ She weeps as mothers on their firstborn's graves, Let her alone!â Then she said, âDid I ask of thee a son? Nay! but I said, âDo not deceive me.â Let the Holy One, That poureth out affliction on my head And mourning, witness between me and theeâ I askÃ¨d not Among my people for a happier lotâ Thy handmaid said, âDo not deceive me!â Prophet, on thy bed Around my firstborn's face Death's shadows fall, Within the little chamber on the wall!â O tidings strange to hear! Too hard, too wonderful for human ear! Will the Most High Recal so soon the child that He hath sent? âYet He is not a man that He should lie, Nor that He should repent!â The child of prayerâ Her child, who kneeling, wept before him there, Who, in the kindness of her heart had made A place of shelter and a welcome shade, A refuge from the heat, Rest for his toilworn limbs and weary feetâ Her child was dead! And yet he turn'd awayâ For what could comfort do, or feeling say? Yet still there was some comfort: strange and wild Though seem'd the words he utter'd to her heart: He said unto his servant, âRise, depart, Gird up thy loins, and lay My staff upon the forehead of the child!â âTake thou my staff, arise and seek The bosom of the plainâ Him that salutes thee by the way, Salute thou not again: Press onward, let thy mission rest Unutter'd and unknown, And lay my staff upon his face, Who slumbers there, alone! âIt may be, that my God will see, And own the mute appealâ It may be that the hand which smote Will turn again and heal: That He, who ever waits to bless, Will grant an answer then, Who doth not willingly afflict, Nor grieve the sons of men! âDepart in haste, but not because Impatient thoughts would stir Within the bosom of the child, Though long thou should'st defer. He, careless of thy willing foot, With young lips clos'd and dumb, Alone and silent on his bed, Will wait till thou art come. âYet, take my staff, and let it rest Upon his pallid face, Watch if a pulse it shall awake, A start, a sigh, a traceâ Of aught that tells of life or change, If hope may yet remainâ Then hast'ning on thy backward path, Return to me again!â Then he arose, And took his master's staff, and went his way, Pass'd on with rapid foot that would not stay For rest or for repose, Or shelter from the heat of that clear harvest dayâ Pass'd on, and reach'd the place, And laid the staff upon the dead child's face; Then listening bentâbut there Was neither voice nor hearingâthere no tone, No look, from sadden'd features still and fair, No sigh, lamenting to be left aloneâ No murmur'd accents fall Upon his mother's name in sleep to callâ Nothing but silence round his bed doth brood, With death and solitude! PART III. âAnd when Elisha was come into the house, behold! the child was dead!ââ2 Kings, iv. 32. The child was deadâ Muteâmute and still he lay upon his bed, And on his tender features yet remain'd A mournful shadowing of the woe that plain'dâ âMy headâmy head!â The utter languor of the heavy lid His dim eyes hid: But death hung brooding on the placid cheek Declin'd in silence meek, And hands, that over-wearied droop'd at rest Upon the quiet breast. Was not help vain?â The child was dead!âThe dead wake not again! Yet he went in to him, and clos'd the door Upon them twainâ Clos'd it, in solitude his soul to pour With all its sorrows in that silent place Before the dead child's face! The Lord had hidden from His servant's eyes The thing that he had doneâand chill surprise And anguish came upon him, like a cloudâ And fear and dread, to shroud The dark unquiet visions of his soul, And doubt awoke, to roll Her earthborn mists across his weary heart, Bidding prophetic visions high depart. And who shall tell what woes his spirit felt That mourn'd the loosing of the silver cord, Who while the living with the dead he knelt And prayed before the Lord? âO that I knew Thee! Darkness veil'd, InvisibleâUnknown! Thy secret hath not been with meâ Dweller afarâAlone!â Who shall bend down thine ear to hear By strength of mortal oath?â O for a Daysman that might lay His hand upon us both! âO that One liv'd to be the Peace, And stand before Thy face, Then would I cry, and Thou should'st hear In that Thy dwelling-place. Withdraw Thy terrors from my soulâ Searcher of hearts, forgive! O Father of my spirit, who Can feel Thy wrathâand live? âBeholdâI know that I am vile In thine all-holy eye,â Abase me lower than the dustâ But hear me when I cryâ Was it for this Thy servant's sin Thy hand was rais'd to slay?â O show me why Thou dost contend, And take the child away! âYeaâhear me for Thy people's sake Who Thy compassions share,â (I number not my lot with theirs, Too base such name to bear)â But if, when they with mercy fill'd Shall turn them to their restâ One gleam of love remainsâO let It reach my darken'd breast! âDost Thou not love me?âyea, Thou dostâ Thou gavest, at my prayer, A child unto the childless wife, Who for my need did care: Thy kindness passeth human thought, That Thou to me hast shown, Or, long since wearied with my ways, It had forgetful grown! âMy Father!ânear yon sun a cloud Hangs from the mountain ledge, And sinking low, his golden rays Stream through its purple edge: Erewhile it loom'd a vapour frail, Dark in the evening sky,â Fill'd with his beams, it poureth now Its glory from on high! âHear me!âThy love upon my soul Descending, hath array'd In rays of light her being frail That once in darkness stray'd. Fill'd with Thy beams to Thee she turnsâ Behold Thy glory thereâ Look not on her, but on her robe, Her garment white and fair. âLook not on her, but on Thine own Thy deep unchanging love, She is no longer meanâadorn'd With beauty from above. RestoreâO Thou that givest strength The prayer of faith to pourâ By all the blessings of the pastâ Giver of lifeârestore! âBy all Thy kindness, by that care That slumbers not, nor sleeps, By hope that mercy yet for us A brighter morning keepsâ By dreams that mystic things unfold, By visions of the night, Prophetic thoughts that shadow forth The dawn of purer light. âBy Him, that on the plain by night Our father Jacob met, Prevailing not, that on his head A princely blessing set,â By all his wrestlings, by that voice Unheard on earth before, And by his name, reveal'd not yet, I cry to thee, Restore!â âRestore!â it echoes stillâthe prayer, âRestore!â Or is there other sound, Some voice that floats around? For there is silence in the place no more! Is it an Angel, sent to minister, Whose wings so near him stir? Or does the evening air towards him flow, With measur'd murmurs low? Still to the Lord the prophet's hands are spread, In supplication strong he bows his head;â The answer comes while yet he prays, âRestore!â And there is silence in the place no more! O calm, calm sleepâ Most holy dreams that those shut eyelids keep Held in their gentle thraldom! O clear eyes, Shining through fringes partingâquiet sighs, And breathing soft and low! âHe is not dead, but sleepeth.â Let them flow, Those winds of evening, to his couch, and chase The shadowy sadness from his peaceful face; Some touch unseen the listless hand hath press'd, And it is warm upon the heaving breast! Asleep, asleep! This day his soul hath lain Hard by the gates of Heav'n, and heard a strain Of music, pure and sweet, The soon-returning spirit sent to greet, And soothe for short delay The soul drawn down by pray'r to its frail home of clay! Asleep, asleep! There is a dim regret On childlike features yetâ Some faint remembrance of that music past: But it is fading fastâ It passeth!âIt is gone! And sweetly now Plays the calm smile upon his cheek and browâ The dream departeth, and the eyes unclose, Won back to earth againâ Forget the rapture of that deep repose, That Heav'nly strain! Hearkenâhe calleth her, that Shunamite, Who in her anguish murmur'd, âIt is well!â In darkness sore, at noon those accents fellâ But it is eventide, and there is lightâ Behold he calleth herâfor all is wonâ And saith, âTake up thy son!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. The following series of poems has been the result of a friendship with the editor's family. Several of them were particularly intended to commemorate walks and drives in the neighbourhood of the parsonage. A WALK TO AMINGTON, ON THE 4TH OF MARCH. âThe days of our life are threescore years and ten.â I A birthday;âand a day that rose With much of hope, with meaning rifeâ A thoughtful day from dawn to close, The middle day of human life. II In sloping fields, on narrow plains The sheep were feeding on their knees, As we went through the winding lanes, Strew'd with red buds of alder trees. III So warm the day,âits influence lent To flagging thought a stronger wing, So utterly was winter spent, So sudden was the birth of spring. IV Wild crocus flowers by copse and hedge In sunlight, clustering thick below, Sigh'd for the firwood's shaded ledge, Where sparkled still a line of snow. V And crowded snowdrops faintly hung Their heads yet lower for the heat, While in still air all branches flung Their shadowy doubles at our feet. VI And through the hedge the sunbeams crept, And through the maple and the birch; And in the airy distance slept, On the broad tower of Tamworth Church. VII Then lingering on our downward way, A little space we stay'd and stood, To see the hazy mist that lay Down in that vale, and by the wood. VIII A distance vague, a dreamy calm The constant sun had lent the scene; And dropt a soft and veiling charm, On broomy knolls and dingles green. IX There are some days that die not out, Nor alter by reflection's power; Whose converse calm, whose words devout, For ever rest the spirit's dower. X And they are days when drops a veil, A mist upon the distance past; And while we say to peaceââAll hail!â We hope that it will always lastâ XI Times when the troubles of the heart Are hush'dâas winds were hush'd that day; And budding hopes begin to start, Like those green hedgerows on our wayâ XII When all within and all around, Like hues on that sweet landscape, blend; And Nature's hand has made to sound The echoes that our heartstrings sendâ XIII When there are rays within, like those That stream'd through maple and through birch; And rested in such calm repose On the broad tower of Tamworth Church. TO KATIE, ASLEEP IN THE DAY-TIME. âThree years she grew in sun and shower, Then Nature said, âA lovelier flower On earth was never sown: This child I to myself will take, She shall be mine, and I will make A lady of my own!ââ Wordsworth. I Little Katie, when your mother Sees you sleeping on your bed, Golden hair upon your pillow Halo-like, around you spread; List'ning to your gentle breathing, Bending down to catch the sighs, And the sleepy words you murmur When the light is on your eyes: II When she hears your little footsteps Running on their devious way, Sees you with your waxen baby Hold a never-wearied play: And with mimic care attend it, And in loving tones caress, Fond and tender words repeating That your own sweet childhood bless: III When she holds you to her bosom, Looking on your dimpled smile, There is âlove that passeth knowledge,â Working in her heart the while: And she thinks, âWhatever sorrow One day in my path may be, And whatever cares may trouble, O this same shall comfort me!â IV Little Katie, when your father First beheld your open eyes, Strange delight was in his blessing, Half incredulous surprise. Only daughter! There is magic Surely in a daughter's name, And the gladness of your birthday Growing still, is still the same. V Little Katie, when your laughter Rises sweetly to his ear, Do you know what thoughts it wakens Of a voice no longer here? Do you know how much you tell him, In its clear and joyful tone, Of lov'd accents that it echoes, And of features like your own? VI When you come with baby footsteps, When you cling about his chair, And he parts from off your forehead The soft curls of veiling hair: Sometimes, looking down, remembrance Of another face doth rise, And he sees, but heeds no longer, Thinking on those buried eyes,â VII On her face, that now lies cover'd With a mantle green and fair, Where at sundown falls the shadow Of a distant house of prayer: At whose feet the young tree flourish'd Ere you came, an infant guest, One, to whom her name descended, And her welcome in his breast. VIII What if more be gather'd shortly, If they go to join her there, Will you fill their vacant places With your watchful love and care? Will you learn the silent language Dimly written on his brow, Minister to wants unspoken, To unutter'd wishes bow? IX It is much if love attend us, Something to be understood: More, if heedful thoughts be on us, Always waiting for our good. Kindness, more than precious jewels Or than ornaments of gold, Beautifies a woman's beauty, Gives her grace when she grows old. X For the sister-voice that never With his household music blends, For that lost delight of childhood Will you make his heart amends? Till he says, âIn all my labours, Long and toilsome though they be, And for all remember'd sorrows, Now this same doth comfort me!â XI XII XIII Pleasure, like that ray of glory By the ancient painters shed Round some pictur'd fond resemblance Of the dear Redeemer's head, In the loom of life doth pleasure, Ere our childish days are told, With the warp and woof enwoven, Glitter like a thread of gold! XIV Be not anxious to discover, Questioning with curious thought, Why in life's embroider'd tissue Should this golden thread be wrought: Nor, as some have done before you, In the midst of joyous play, Wonder why you are so happy, And how soon 'twill pass away! XV Pass it surely will, and earlyâ Thoughtless pleasures will not last; Things that perish in the usingâ Morning rime that melteth fast. But, instead will come perceptions Of a nature more intense; Conscious joys â but care-attended, Growing up with thought and sense: XVI Things our Childhood did not dream on While she linger'd with us still, Making necklaces of daisiesâ Sailing fleets along the rill: She is gone! and with her vanish'd Much that fancy well may rue, Theories that shrink from proving, And beliefs no longer true. XVII Then there comes a feeling common To the disenchanted heart, As it thinks how marvel ceaseth, And from earth how wonders part. âMiracles have long been over, All things follow changeless rule,â Angels stir not now the waters, Of Bethesda's desert pool. XVIII âMen forget the worlds above them, And can see no signs in Heav'n, Art has almost put out Nature With her deep insidious leav'n: And our God withdraws his presence, While perverse, in harden'd mood Live the Tribes that once He nourish'd, Forty years on Angels' food.â XIX So doth Youth â from fables risingâ Fashion out of all she sees, Even from this world's condition, Fellow thoughts and sympathies: Even Nature's face we colour With the mind's prevailing tone, Change her language to a cadence, Harmonizing with our own! XX Thought is free, the sages tell usâ Free to rove, and free to soar, But affection lives in bondage, That enthralls her more and more: From her utmost branch she sendeth, Downward like the Indian tree, Roots that with the earth connect her, Strongly and enduringly. XXI Yet alas! for something betterâ Love is such a helpless thingâ Poor as earthly gold and silver, Life to buy, or peace to bring. Like a woman empty-handed, Weeping for her children's need, Love can heal no pang it mourneth, Nor her tears the children feed! XXII Then our envy turns upon usâ âWhat! and would'st thou purchase rest By the drying up of feeling, By love's cooling in thy breast? No! thou would'st not! why complain then, Simple reasoner that thou art? How shall these two dwell togetherâ Quiet life and loving heart?â XXIII There is no such thing as silence, Sleepless echoes round us wait, Every sound we can interpret Makes it bear on ev'ry state: Absent voices crowd about us, Talking with us by the way; Faces that the grave has cover'd Look upon us all the day. XXIV And their words are not reproachful, Though we sometimes wish they were, Pain'd for every past unkindness, That from us they had to bear. Many needless things are spoken, (Words to folly near akin) Rather than in silence listen To those voices from within! XXV Little Katie, when your childhood Passeth, like a dream of night, Then may youth arise uncloudedâ Like a summer morning bright. Having left no absent voices Any cause to pain you thusâ Live to hear from all who love youâ âO this same doth comfort us!â July, 1847. HOPWAS WOOD AT THE END OF APRIL. Never tell me how the sun Steeps the meadow lands in light; Stealthy entrance he hath won Here to drop his star-beams bright. Changing fretwork here he lays On the mosses and the grass; In and out his prying rays Dash and dart, and gleam and pass. Under woven branches high, Down upon the wood-ruffe's head, Little spots of sunshine lie, Wandering patches change and spread. Here the chaffinch and his mate Build themselves âa mansion small;â Starlings sit in chattering state, And the jealous thrushes call. Shall I tell you what they say, Singing for their own delight? Listen to the linnet's lay In the chestnut out of sight. âO my mate with snowy breast, And with eyes so bright and black, Fear not for thy mossy nest, Leafy shade it doth not lack. âSam and Henry did not see, When to-day they play'd belowâ Of the treasure in the tree Sam and Henry did not know. âSafe from reach of spoiler's hand, Sit and dream with half-shut eyes; Drowsy moths about thee stand, And blue panting dragon-flies. âWhile the chestnut blossoms fall Thickly on thy nest and thee, Dusky bees and beetles small Hum around thee restlessly. âWhen the rising sun shall peep At our nestlings laid in down, Sam and Henry fast asleep Shall not dream it in the town. âIn the topmost branch enshrin'd, Look abroad on meadows fair; And in soft grey moss reclin'd, Think upon thy speckled care. âGreen beyond thee lies the ridge, That yon gloomy fir-trees crown; And the river and the bridge, And the road into the town. âSunk in rushes to their breasts, Village boys thy bright eye kens, Wading after ousels' nests, And the eggs of waterhens. âLittle isles where osiers grow Stem and fret the shallow tide; There the white swans floating go, With the grey one at their side. âAnd, their arms together link'd, Witch-elms hang above the well; While in quietness distinct Sounds the tinkling chapel bell. âFear not thou, but dream at ease, Shut thy glossy wings and rest; While the balmy southern breeze Sways thee gently on thy nest. âWhen the moon-beams through the tree, On thy first-laid egg came down, Sam and Henry did not see, Fast asleep in Tamworth Town.â This was what the linnet said, Singing of his own delight, And the happy life he led In the chestnut out of sight. July, 1847. THE PARSONAGE GARDEN. Within these walls has much been done, and much has been effac'd, For each successor makes a change in what the last had trac'd: Old-fashion'd plants and flowers are thrown aside in high disdain, And dwellers next to these perhaps will alter it again. When the grave old Friars went two and two along the broad straight walks; When the orange lily and the flag uprear'd their stately stalks, By beds where herb-angelica and feathery fennels grew, Sweet marjoram, and basil green, and mint, and balm, and rueâ O they little thought, as side by side, with sleek and sober pace, They talk'd of holy Mother Church, and of our Lady's grace, That on a day their garden trim so gay a dress would don, And children's feet would tread its walks, when they were dead and gone. But if their gambols and their joy those grave old Friars could see, They would hardly give those children dear their âBenediciteââ Those little heretics that plant and dig their garden small, In what was once the bed of herbs beneath the ancient wall. They would look askance at once trim beds, where double daisies stood, And groan to find them fill'd with docks and bluebells from the wood; While the owners delve with might and main in gravel, mould, and clay; And give their minds to that hard work and toil that boys call play. They would look askance at the arbour nigh, where haply they might see A student grave with a dimpled cheek, and a book upon his knee; A-reading of Aladdin's Lamp, or famous Robin Hood, Of simple Susan and her lamb, or the Children in the Wood. Perhaps where green the terrace bank slopes downward to the grass, Where to her school the mistress now doth every morning pass, Or where the nurse walks up and down with children at her knees, Grew beds of borage long ago, to feed the Friars' bees. Perhaps where this young sycamore waves lightly over-head, The Friars stood to give away the weekly dole of bread; And thought to reach the gates of Heaven, by that more easy way, And make themselves a name on earth, that never should decay. This ancient wall of all their works is standing now alone; With here a range of rugged bricks, and there a rough-hewn stone. O! well for us that little more doth of their works remain! O! sad would be the day that saw the Friars here again! HOPWAS WOOD AT THE END OF MAY. I had a dream last night, a pleasant dream, After the busy day, Full of delightful thoughts of many things, And places far away. A dream, my Mother, of that quiet wood, To some blest souls akin; Round which, though stormy winds may pine and rave, They cannot come within. Methought I enter'd by the mossy gate, And went up all alone, Where, thick as stars upon a frosty night, The primrose flowers were strewnâ Among the arums and the prone woodbine, Through bushy broom and heath, Where spiral grass peer'd through the last year's leaves, That rustled underneath. And further down into the deepest glades, Where lady-ferns grew high, And where a few long sunbeams cross'd the slopes, And glimmer'd quietly. And where blue egg-shells on the ground were strew'd, And golden king-cups shone, I went, and thought how seldom in my life I had been quite alone. It was a pleasant thought to be shut in, Whatever winds might rise, Shelter'd and safe, with matted boughs o'er head, And hid from human eyes. Among the silver birch trees and the oaks, Down to the quiet stream, In light sent down through half-transparent leaves, I wander'd in my dream. And heard the birds that sat apart and sang, Each from his leafy sprayâ Notes, cheerful as the sound of morning bells, That ring in Christmas day. They never stopp'd, but sent among the trees Their voices clear and strong; While humming insects kept throughout my way An endless under-song. There was an osier basket in my hand, And I had fill'd it well With spotted orchis flowers and woodruffe sweet And âdewy asphodel;â Brown cones from larches dropt, wood-sorrels red, And mosses green and grey, And blue-barr'd feathers that in chase had fallen From wing of chattering jay. So, come at last to a most shady dell, Where pines and larches stood, I knew how broadly shone upon their heads The sun above the wood. Though underneath among their sloping boughs, That bending low did meet, A soft green twilight made the summer noon Like evening, dim and sweet. And in my dream reclining on the moss, With daisy buds o'erlaid, Methought I saw two of the fairy folk Down walking in the shadeâ Two fairy dames, no taller than a span, With hair of golden hue; And, as the skies upon a summer day, Their open eyes were blue. They did not look at me, but as they went, In voice as small and sweet As the slight humming of the laden bee, With pollen-covered feetâ I heard one fairy speak of me, and say, âHow found she then so soon This place where little crested wrens resort, To keep their honey-moon?â âShe's only dreaming,â said the answering voice, âShe is not truly here, For she has made no foot-prints in the moss, Nor bent the branches near. âO these immortals often live and die, And leave no trace behindâ Not in one place that they have trodden here, Nor one yet living mind. âShe's dreaming, and her life is half a dream, Leave her in peace alone, The daughters of her race dream much and oft Of things to us unknown.â So wending on, they soon pass'd out of view The antler'd ferns between, With snowy robes and mystic girdles rare, And gentle pace serene. And I, with thoughts perplex'd, suspicions vague, That these things did but seem, Was only half surpris'd to see you stand Beside me in my dream. And I said, âMother, is there nothing real? Truly I cannot tellâ Perhaps I never saw this wood before, I seem to know so well. âPerhaps there is not such a place on earthâ If now I sleep, again I may awake and utterly forget, And lose it from my brain. âPerhaps I never saw these woodbine wreaths, The sapling oaks that span, Nor heard the wind awaken on its path These notes Ãolian. âAnd yet it seems to me in this same place, That looking down the glade, We waited till the books were brought, and read, Here, in this pleasant shade. âWhat was it that those fairy people said? Their voices haunt me still, I see there are no human footprints trac'd Upon this sloping hill. âOf those who trod a hundred years ago These paths, the woods are dumbâ O, will they be for these dear friends of mine A hundred years to come? âThe place is gleaming with this sunny sheen, With songs of thrushes sweet, The shadows of the leaves with flickerings light Are dancing at my feet; âAs on an April day not long ago They waver'd in the wind, While we sat listening to that Roman tale, Beneath the trees reclin'd. âBut summer has forgotten spring, and wears Than hers a fairer face, The morning has forgotten night, and bears Of her lost stars no trace. âThe goldfinch has forgot his last year's mate, With this as well content, The hare forgets her full-grown leveret's fate, And heeds not where he went. âAnd the forgetful woods, now birds are come, Repeat their voices clear, And keep no echo of that Roman tale, That once was taught them here. âAnd when those listeners thread these paths no more, The birds will still be gay, Spring will forget them, and their names shall melt Like wintry snows away.â And then methought you spoke to me, and said, âE'en such shall be their lot! Yet though the present must forget the past, And be in turn forgotâ âThough the unborn a hundred years to come, Know not their place of rest, Though Earth forget her buried children, laid To sleep in her cold breastâ âWhat will it matter to the souls in bliss, That, gather'd to their fold, Abide upon the everlasting hills, And blest communion hold? âSafe in a city that no light doth need From sun, nor moon, nor star, Where souls redeem'd of martyrs and of saints, And kings and prophets areâ âA city where no sighing is, nor tears, Nor fear of death affrays, Whose âwallsâ are call'd âsalvation to the Lord,â And all whose âgatesâ are âpraise.â âTo whose inhabitants their wanderings here, And lives on earth may seem, With all their thoughts and changes manifold, No longer than a dreamâ ââA dream when one awaketh!ââ and with this I thought you turn'd away, And with a sigh I suddenly awoke, And found that it was day. And through my curtains slanting to the wall, Came down a golden beam, As partly pleas'd and partly pain'd, I knew That this too was a dream. A HYMN OF SUPPLICATION. I. Light of the world, when gloomy fears oppress, When darkness shrouds us here, Shine, and the desolate with comfort bless, The sad in spirit cheer. Break through the clouds, thy smile on earth shall be As Heaven on earth begunâ Arise, thy beams of mercy let us see, O God, our Sun! Fort of defence, whereto in ages past Thy saints for safety fled, Be thou a shelter from the stormy blast, From snares around us spread. Be still a refuge for the weary feet Of this thy praying flock; Be unto us a shadow from the heat, O God, our rock! A HYMN OF PRAISE. II. Because thine only Son thou didst not spare, But sent him down to die, Great King of Heaven, didst yet for rebels care, And bring the aliens nighâ Therefore thy sovereign bounty we will praise, And of thy mercies sing, Telling of this thy love through endless days, O God our King! Because Thou dost thy gracious care bestow, And thy protecting arm Extend to us in every time of woe, Of danger and alarmâ We will make mention of thy glorious name, To Thee our praises yieldâ Thou art a refuge ever found the same, O God our Shield. Because Thou hast prepar'd for us a place, Where toil and turmoil cease, Where strife must flee away before thy face, And conflict change to peaceâ We will remember this thy love, and pray, âFather thy name be blest, Hasten the dawning of Redemption's day, O God our Rest!â Because thy grace Thou didst to us extend, And bid us sinners live, Because Thou wilt preserve us to the end, And thy free spirit giveâ Therefore with angels will we praise thy name, Before thy footstool fall, And raise our songs to thee with loud acclaim, O God our All! HENRY, AGED SEVEN YEARS. Yellow leaves, how fast they flutter â woodland hollows thickly strewing, Where the wan October sunbeams scantly in the mid-day win, While the dim grey clouds are drifting, and in sadden'd hues embuing All without and all within! All within! but winds of autumn, little Henry, round their dwelling Did not load your father's spirit with those deep and burden'd sighs;â Only echo'd thoughts of sadness, in your mother's bosom swelling, Fast as tears that dim her eyes. Life is fraught with many changes, check'd with sorrow and mutation, But no grief it ever lighten'd such a truth before to know:â I behold them â father, mother â as they seem'd to contemplation, Only three short weeks ago! Sadden'd for the morrow's parting â up the stairs at midnight stealingâ As with cautious foot we glided past the children's open door, ââCome in hereâ they said, the lamplight dimpled forms at rest revealing, âKiss them in their sleep once moreâ You were sleeping, little Henry, with your eyelids scarcely closing, Two sweet faces near together, with their rounded arms entwin'd:â And the rosebud lips were moving, as if stirr'd in their reposing By the movements of the mind! And your mother smooth'd the pillow, and her sleeping treasures number'd, Whispering fondly â âHe is dreamingâ â as you turn'd upon your bedâ And your father stoop'd to kiss you, happy dreamer, as you slumber'd, With his hand upon your head! Did he know the true deep meaning of his blessing? No! he never Heard afar the summons utter'd â âCome up hitherâ â never knew How the awful Angel faces kept his sleeping boy for ever, And for ever in their view. Awful Faces, unimpassion'd, silent Presences were by us, Shrouding wings â majestic beings â hidden by this earthly veil â Such as we have call'd on, saying, âPraise the Lord, O Ananias, Azarias and Misael!â But we saw not, and who knoweth, what the mission'd Spirits taught him, To that one small bed drawn nearer, when we left him to their will? While he slumber'd, who can answer for what dreams they may have brought him, When at midnight all was still? Father! Mother! must you leave him on his bed, but not to slumber? Are the small hands meekly folded on his breast, but not to pray? When you count your children over, must you tell a different number, Since that happier yesterday? It was well then, since this must be, that the Angels stood before him, To enfold the ransom'd spirit, newly enter'd into restâ From his mother's mournful bosom, from his father's prayer they bore him, Safe to his Redeemer's breast. Father! Mother! weep if need be, since this is a âtimeâ for weeping, Comfort comes not for the calling, grief is never argued downâ Coldly sounds the admonition, âWhy lament? in better keeping Rests the child than in your own.â âTruth indeed! but, oh! compassion! Have you sought to scan my sorrow?â (Mother, you shall meekly ponder, list'ning to that common tale,) âDoes your heart repeat its echo, or by fellow-feeling borrow Ev'n a tone that might avail? âMight avail to steal it from me, by its deep heart-warm affection? Might perceive by strength of loving how the fond words to combine? Surely no! I will be silent, in your soul is no reflection Of the care that burdens mine!â When the winter twilight gathers, Father, and your thoughts shall wander, Sitting lonely you shall blend him with your listless reveries, Half forgetful what division holds the form whereon you ponder From its place upon your kneesâ With a start of recollection, with a half-reproachful wonder, Of itself the heart shall question, âArt Thou then no longer here? Is it so, my little Henry? Are we set so far asunder Who were wont to be so near?â While the fire-light dimly flickers, and the lengthen'd shades are meeting, To itself the heart shall answer, âNever more, oh! never more I shall hear without, his footsteps, nor the child's sweet voice entreating For admission at my door!â But upon your fair, fair forehead, no regrets nor griefs are dwelling, Neither sorrow nor disquiet do the peaceful features know; Nor that look, whose wistful beauty seem'd their sad hearts to be telling, âDaylight breaketh, let me go!â Daylight breaketh, little Henry; in its beams your soul awakethâ What though night should close around us, dim and dreary to the viewâ Though our souls should walk in darkness, far away that morning breaketh Into endless day for you! Monday, 15th October, 1849. SAMUEL, AGED NINE YEARS. They have left you, little Henry, but they have not left you lonelyâ Brothers' hearts so knit together could not, might not separate dwell, Fain to seek you in the mansions far awayâOne linger'd only To bid those behind farewell! Gentle Boy!âHis child-like nature in most guileless form was moulded, And it may be that his spirit woke in glory unawares, Since so calmly he resign'd it, with his hands still meekly folded, Having said his evening prayers. Orâif conscious of that summonsââSpeak, O Lord, Thy servant hearethââ As one said, whose name they gave him, might his willing answer be, âHere am Iââlike him replyingââAt Thy gates my soul appeareth, For behold Thou calledst me!â A deep silenceâutter silence, on his earthly home descendeth:â Reading, playing, sleeping, wakingâhe is gone, and few remain! âO the lossââthey utter weepingâevery voice its echo lendethâ âO the loss!ââBut, O the gain! On that tranquil shore his spirit was vouchsaf'd an early landing, Lest the toils of crime should stain it, or the thrall of guilt controlâ Lest that âwickedness should alter the yet simple understanding, Or deceit beguile his soul!â âLay not up on earth thy treasureââthey have read that sentence duly, Moth and rust shall fret thy richesâearthly good hath swift decayâ âEven so,â each heart repliethââAs for me, my riches truly Make them wings and flee away!â âO my riches!âO my children!âdearest part of life and being, Treasures look'd to for the solace of this life's declining years,â Were our voices cold to hearingâor our faces cold to seeing, That ye left us to our tears?â âRolling time and God's good blessing twin'd for us a wreath of roses, Seven rosebuds bloom'd upon itânone else knew how sweet they were: Comes the blastâthe buds lie scatter'dâe'en the sweetest fades and closesâ Cherish'd buds, ye promis'd fair!â âFast a Heavenly Hand is twining now again those buds together, (Broken wreath of home, too precious to adorn an earthly brow!) Wrought into a fairer chaplet, blooming safe from wintry weather, They await our advent now.â âWe inherit conscious silence, ceasing of some merry laughter, And the hush of two sweet voicesâ(healing sounds for spirits bruis'd!) Of the tread of joyous footsteps in the pathway following after, Of two names no longer used!â Question for them, little Sister, in your sweet and childish fashionâ Search and seek them, Baby Brother, with your calm and asking eyesâ Dimpled lips that fail to utter fond appeal or sad compassion, Mild regret or dim surprise! When the words above you graven, speak the sorrow of the living, When the passers by shall read them, and behold your early doom, They shall sigh, and sayââGod comfort, with the peace of his own giving, Those who laid them in this tomb! âAnd God soothe their mother's sorrow, heal the sharp, keen pain of partingââ (Many a mother's voice shall utter, when her feet approach the place) âWhisper comfort to her spiritâdry those mournful tears, that starting Dim the brightness of her face!â There are two tall trees above you, by the high east window growing, Underneath them, slumber sweetly, lapt in silence deep, serene; Save, when pealing in the distance, organ notes towards you flowing Echoâwith a pause between! And that pause?âa voice shall fill itâtones that bless'd you daily, nightly, Well belov'd, but not sufficing, Sleepers, to awake you now, Though so near he stand, that shadows from your trees may tremble lightly On his book and on his brow! Sleep then ever! Neither singing of sweet birds shall break your slumber, Neither fall of dew, nor sunshine, dance of leaves, nor drift of snow, Charm those dropt lids more to open, nor the tranquil bosoms cumber With one care for things below! It is something, the assurance, that you ne'er shall feel like sorrow, Weep no past and dread no futureâknow not sighingâfeel not painâ Nor a day that looketh forward to a mournfuller to-morrowâ âClouds returning after rain!â It shall never be your portion, like your father's and your mother's, To keep watch by infant pillows, and receive the parting sighâ And to dread that Angel-waiters for the spirits of your brothers Draw yet nigher and more nigh! In the strain of anguish'd feeling, this one thought shall breathe of healing, Though their feet be sorely wearied by the roughness of the wayâ And your father and your mother thus shall comfort one the other, In this dark and gloomy day:â âYour day breaketh, precious children, in its beams each soul awakethâ What though night be closing round us, dark and dreary to the viewâ Though the light our eyes forsakethâclear and sweet afar it breaketh Into endless day for you!â 29th October, 1849. KATIE, AGED FIVE YEARS. [ASLEEP IN JESUS.] All rough winds are hush'd and silent, golden light the meadow steepeth, And the last October roses daily wax more pale and fair; They have laid a gather'd blossom on the breast of one who sleepeth With a sunbeam on her hair. Calm, and drap'd in snowy raiment she lies still, as one that dreameth, And a grave sweet smile hath parted dimpled lips that may not speak; Slanting down, that narrow sunbeam like a ray of glory gleameth On the sainted brow and cheek. There is silence! They who watch her, speak no word of grief or wailing, In a strange unwonted calmness they gaze on and cannot cease, Though the pulse of life beat faintly, thought shrink back, and hope be failing, They, like Aaron, âhold their peace.â While they gaze on her, the deep bell with its long slow pauses soundeth; They are silentâfatherâmotherâlove has nothing more to say: Beating time to feet of Angels leading her where love aboundeth Tolls the heavy bell this day. In their hearts, to its deep tolling, they count over all her meetness To lie near their hearts and soothe them in all sorrows and all fears; Her short life lies spread before them, but they cannot tell her sweetness, Easily as tell her years. Only daughterâAh! how fondly Thought around that lost name lingers, Oft when lone your mother sitteth, she shall weep and droop her head, She shall mourn her baby-sempstress, with those imitative fingers, Drawing out her aimless thread. In your father's Future cometh many a sad uncheer'd to-morrow, But in sleep shall three fair faces heavenly-calm towards him leanâ Like a three-fold cord shall draw him through the weariness of sorrow, Nearer to the things unseen. They must spare you, little Katie, with that smile of God's own giving, Side by side with your sweet brothers in one grave must make you room; Cover your exceeding beautyâmore than beauty of the livingâ With the shadows of the tomb! With the closing of your eyelids close the dreams of expectation, And so ends the fairest chapter in the records of their way: ThereforeâO thou God most holyâGod of rest and consolation, Be Thou near to them this day! Be Thou near, when they shall nightly, by the bed of infant brothers, Hear their soft and gentle breathing, and shall bless them on their knees; And shall think how coldly falleth the white moon-light on the others, In their bed beneath the trees. Be Thou near, when they, they only, bear those faces in remembrance, And the number of their children strangers ask them with a smile; And when other child-like faces touch them by the strong resemblance To those turn'd to them erewhile. Be Thou near, each chasten'd Spirit for its course and conflict nerving, Let Thy voice say, âFatherâmotherâlo! thy treasures live above! Now be strong, be strong, no longer cumber'd overmuch with serving At the shrine of human love.â Let them sleep! In course of ages e'en the Holy House shall crumble, And the broad and stately steeple one day bend to its decline, And high arches, ancient arches bow'd and deck'd in clothing humble Creeping moss shall round them twine. Ancient arches, old and hoary, sunny beams shall glimmer through them, And invest them with a beauty we would fain they should not share, And the moonlight slanting down them, the white moonlight shall embue them With a sadness dim and fair. Then the soft green moss shall wrap you, and the world shall all forget you, Life, and stir, and toil, and tumult unawares shall pass you by; Generations come and vanish: but it shall not grieve nor fret you, That they sin, or that they sigh. And the world, grown old in sinning, shall deny her first beginning, And think scorn of words which whisper how that all must pass away; Time's arrest and intermission shall account a vain tradition, And a dream, the reckoning day! 'Till His blast, a blast of terror, shall awake in shame and sadness Faithless millions to a vision of the failing earth and skies, And more sweet than song of Angels, in their shout of joy and gladness, Call the dead in Christ to rise! Then, by One Man's intercession, standing clear from their transgression, Fatherâmotherâyou shall meet them fairer than they were before, And have joy with the RedeemÃ¨d, joy ear hath not heardâheart dreamÃ¨d, Ay for everâevermore! 3rd November, 1849.
