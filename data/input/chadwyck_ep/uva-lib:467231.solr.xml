      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO EDITH SOUTHEY. Edith! I brought thee late a humble gift, The songs of earlier youth; it was a wreath With many an unripe blossom garlanded And many a weed, yet mingled with some flowers Which will not wither. Dearest! now I bring A worthier offering; thou wilt prize it well, For well thou know'st amid what painful cares My solace was in this: and though to me There is no music in the hollowness Of common praise, yet well content am I Now to look back upon my youth's green prime, Nor idly, nor unprofitably past, Imping in such adventurous essay The wing, and strengthening it for steadier flight. Burton, near Christ Church, 1797. JOAN OF ARC. THE FIRST BOOK. There was high feasting held at Vaucouleur, For old Sir Robert had a famous guest, The Bastard Orleans; and the festive hours, Cheer'd with the Trobador's sweet minstrelsy, Pass'd gaily at his hospitable board. But not to share the hospitable board And hear sweet minstrelsy, Dunois had sought Sir Robert's hall; he came to rouse Lorraine, And glean what force the wasting war had left For one last effort. Little had the war Left in Lorraine, but age, and youth unripe For slaughter yet, and widows, and young maids Of widow'd loves. And now with his great guest The Lord of Vaucouleur sat communing On what might profit France, and found no hope, Despairing of their country, when he heard An old man and a maid awaited him In the castle-hall. He knew the old man well, His vassal Claude; and at his bidding Claude Approach'd, and after meet obeisance made, Bespake Sir Robert. “Good my Lord, I come With a strange tale; I pray you pardon me If it should seem impertinent, and like An old man's weakness. But, in truth, this Maid Hath with such boding thoughts impress'd my heart, I think I could not longer sleep in peace Gainsaying what she sought. She saith that God Bids her go drive the Englishmen from France! Her parents mock at her and call her crazed, And father Regnier says she is possess'd; . . But I, who know that never thought of ill Found entrance in her heart, . . for, good my Lord, From her first birth-day she hath been to me As mine own child, . . and I am an old man, Who have seen many moon-struck in my time, And some who were by evil Spirits vex'd, . . I, Sirs, do think that there is more in this. And who can tell but, in these perilous times, It may please God, . . . but hear the Maid yourselves For if, as I believe, this is of Heaven, My silly speech doth wrong it.” While he spake, Curious they mark'd the Damsel. She appear'd Of eighteen years; there was no bloom of youth Upon her cheek, yet had the loveliest hues Of health with lesser fascination fix'd The gazer's eye; for wan the Maiden was, Of saintly paleness, and there seem'd to dwell In the strong beauties of her countenance Something that was not earthly. “I have heard Of this your niece's malady,” replied The Lord of Vaucouleur, “that she frequents The loneliest haunts and deepest solitude, Estranged from human kind and human cares With loathing like to madness. It were best To place her with some pious sisterhood, Who duly morn and eve for her soul's health Soliciting Heaven, may likeliest remedy The stricken mind, or frenzied or possess'd.” So as Sir Robert ceased, the Maiden cried, “I am not mad. Possess'd indeed I am! The hand of God is strong upon my soul, And I have wrestled vainly with the Lord, And stubbornly, I fear me. I can save This country, Sir! I can deliver France! Yea.. I must save the country! . . God is in me; I speak not, think not, feel not of myself. He knew and sanctified me ere my birth; He to the nations hath ordained me; And whither he shall send me, I must go; And whatso he commands, that I must speak; And whatso is his will, that I must do; And I must put away all fear of man, Lest he in wrath confound me.” At the first With pity or with scorn Dunois had heard The Maid inspired; but now he in his heart Felt that misgiving which precedes belief In what was disbelieved and scoff'd at late For folly. “Damsel!” said the Chief, “methinks It would be wisely done to doubt this call, Haply of some ill Spirit prompting thee To self destruction.” “Doubt!” the Maid exclaim'd, It were as easy when I gaze around On all this fair variety of things, Green fields and tufted woods, and the blue depth Of heaven, and yonder glorious sun, to doubt Creating wisdom! When in the evening gale I breathe the mingled odours of the spring, And hear the wild wood melody, and hear The populous air vocal with insect life, To doubt God's goodness! There are feelings, Chief, Which cannot lie; and I have oftentimes Felt in the midnight silence of my soul The call of God.” They listen'd to the Maid, And they almost believed. Then spake Dunois, “Wilt thou go with me, Maiden, to the King, And there announce thy mission?” thus he said, For thoughts of politic craftiness arose Within him, and his faith, yet unconfirm'd, Determin'd to prompt action. She replied, “Therefore I sought the Lord of Vaucouleur, That with such credence as prevents delay, He to the King might send me. Now beseech you Speed our departure!” Then Dunois address'd Sir Robert, “Fare thee well, my friend and host! It were ill done to linger here when Heaven Vouchsafes such strange assistance. Let what force Lorraine can raise to Chinon follow us; And with the tidings of this holy Maid, Sent by the Lord, fill thou the country; soon Therewith shall France awake as from the sleep Of death. Now Maid! depart we at thy will.” “God's blessing go with ye!” exclaim'd old Claude, “Good Angels guard my girl!” and as he spake The tears stream'd fast adown his aged cheeks. “And if I do not live to see thee more, As sure I think I shall not, . . yet sometimes Remember thine old Uncle. I have loved thee Even from thy childhood Joan! and I shall lose The comfort of mine age in losing thee. But God be with thee, Child!” Nor was the Maid, Though all subdued of soul, untroubled now In that sad parting; . . but she calm'd herself, Painfully keeping down her heart, and said, “Comfort thyself, my Uncle, with the thought Of what I am, and for what enterprize Chosen from among the people. Oh! be sure I shall remember thee, in whom I found A parent's love, when parents were unkind! And when the ominous broodings of my soul Were scoff'd and made a mock of by all else, Thou for thy love didst hear me and believe. Shall I forget these things?” . . . By this Dunois Had arm'd, the steeds stood ready at the gate. But then she fell upon the old man's neck And cried, “Pray for me! . . I shall need thy prayers! Pray for me, that I fail not in my hour!” Thereat awhile, as if some aweful thought Had overpower'd her, on his neck she hung; Then rising with flush'd cheek and kindling eye, “Farewell!” quoth she, “and live in hope! Anon Thou shalt hear tidings to rejoice thy heart, Tidings of joy for all, but most for thee! Be this thy comfort!” The old man received Her last embrace, and weeping like a child, Scarcely through tears could see them on their steeds Spring up, and go their way. So on they went, And now along the mountain's winding path Upward they journey'd slow, and now they paused And gazed where o'er the plain the stately towers Of Vaucouleur arose, in distance seen, Dark and distinct; below its castled height, Through fair and fertile pastures, the deep Meuse Roll'd glittering on. Domremi's cottages Gleam'd in the sun hard by, white cottages, That in the evening traveller's weary mind Had waken'd thoughts of comfort and of home, Making him yearn for rest. But on one spot, One little spot, the Virgin's eye was fix'd, Her native Arc; embower'd the hamlet lay Upon the forest edge, whose ancient woods, With all their infinite varieties, Now form'd a mass of shade. The distant plain Rose on the horizon rich with pleasant groves, And vineyards in the greenest hue of spring, And streams now hidden on their winding way, Now issuing forth in light. The Maiden gazed Till all grew dim upon her dizzy eye. “Oh what a blessed world were this!” she cried, “But that the great and honourable men Have seized the earth, and of the heritage Which God, the Sire of all, to all had given, Disherited their brethren! Happy those Who in the after-days shall live when Time Hath spoken, and the multitude of years Taught wisdom to mankind! . . Unhappy France! Fiercer than evening wolves thy bitter foes Rush o'er the land, and desolate, and kill; Long has the widow's and the orphan's groan Accused Heaven's justice;—but the hour is come! God hath inclined his ear, hath heard the voice Of mourning, and his anger is gone forth.” Then said the Son of Orleans, “Holy Maid! Fain would I know, if blameless I may seek Such knowledge, how the heavenly call was heard First in thy waken'd soul; nor deem in me Aught idly curious, if of thy past life I ask the story. In the hour of age, If haply I survive to see this realm Deliver'd, precious then will be the thought That I have known the delegated Maid, And heard from her the wondrous ways of Heaven.” “A simple tale,” the mission'd Maid replied; “Yet may it well employ the journeying hour, And pleasant is the memory of the past “See'st thou, Sir Chief, where yonder forest skirts The Meuse, that in its winding mazes shows, As on the farther bank, the distant towers Of Vaucouleur? there in the hamlet Arc My father's dwelling stands; a lowly hut, Yet nought of needful comfort did it lack, For in Lorraine there lived no kinder Lord Than old Sir Robert, and my father Jaques In flocks and herds was rich; a toiling man, Intent on worldly gains, one in whose heart Affection had no root. I never knew A parent's love; for harsh my mother was, And deem'd the care which infancy demands Irksome, and ill-repaid. Severe they were, And would have made me fear them; but my soul Possess'd the germ of inborn fortitude, And stubbornly I bore unkind rebuke And angry chastisement. Yet was the voice That spake in tones of tenderness most sweet To my young heart; how have I felt it leap With transport, when my Uncle Claude approach'd! For he would take me on his knee, and tell Such wondrous tales as childhood loves to hear, Listening with eager eyes and open lips Devoutly in attention. Good old man! Oh if I ever pour'd a prayer to Heaven Unhallow'd by the grateful thought of him, Methinks the righteous winds would scatter it! He was a parent to me, and his home Was mine, when in advancing years I found No peace, no comfort in my father's house. With him I pass'd the pleasant evening hours, By day I drove my father's flock afield, And this was happiness. “Amid these wilds Often to summer pasture have I driven The flock; and well I know these woodland wilds, And every bosom'd vale, and valley stream Is dear to memory. I have laid me down Beside yon valley stream, that up the ascent Scarce sends the sound of waters now, and watch'd The beck roll glittering to the noon-tide sun, And listened to its ceaseless murmuring, Till all was hush'd and tranquil in my soul, Fill'd with a strange and undefined delight That pass'd across the mind like summer clouds Over the vale at eve; their fleeting hues The traveller cannot trace with memory's eye, Yet he remembers well how fair they were, How beautiful. “In solitude and peace Here I grew up, amid the loveliest scenes Of unpolluted nature. Sweet it was, As the white mists of morning roll'd away, To see the upland's wooded heights appear Dark in the early dawn, and mark the slope With gorse-flowers glowing, as the sun illumed Their golden glory with his deepening light; Pleasant at noon beside the vocal brook To lay me down, and watch the floating clouds, And shape to fancy's wild similitudes Their ever-varying forms; and oh how sweet! To drive my flock at evening to the fold, And hasten to our little hut, and hear The voice of kindness bid me welcome home. “Amid the village playmates of my youth Was one whom riper years approved a friend. A gentle maid was my poor Madelon; I loved her as a sister, and long time Her undivided tenderness possess'd, Until a better and a holier tie Gave her one nearer friend; and then my heart Partook her happiness, for never lived A happier pair than Arnaud and his wife. “Lorraine was call'd to arms, and with her youth Went Arnaud to the war. The morn was fair, Bright shone the sun, the birds sung cheerfully, And all the fields seem'd joyous in the spring; But to Domremi wretched was that day, For there was lamentation, and the voice Of anguish, and the deeper agony That spake not. Never can my heart forget The feelings that shot through me, when the horn Gave its last call, and through the castle-gate The banner moved, and from the clinging arms Which hung on them, as for a last embrace, Sons, brethren, husbands, went. “More frequent now Sought I the converse of poor Madelon, For now she needed friendship's soothing voice. All the long summer did she live in hope Of tidings from the war; and as at eve She with her mother by the cottage door Sat in the sunshine, if a traveller Appear'd at distance coming o'er the brow, Her eye was on him, and it might be seen By the flush'd cheek what thoughts were in her heart, And by the deadly paleness which ensued, How her heart died within her. So the days And weeks and months pass'd on; and when the leaves Fell in the autumn, a most painful hope That reason own'd not, that with expectation Did never cheer her as she rose at morn, Still linger'd in her heart, and still at night Made disappointment dreadful. Winter came, But Arnaud never from the war return'd, He far away had perish'd; and when late The tidings of his certain death arrived, Sore with long anguish underneath that blow She sunk. Then would she sit and think all day Upon the past, and talk of happiness That never could return, as though she found Best solace in the thoughts which minister'd To sorrow: and she loved to see the sun Go down, because another day was gone, And then she might retire to solitude And wakeful recollections, or perchance To sleep more wearying far than wakefulness, Dreams of his safety and return, and starts Of agony; so neither night nor day Could she find rest, but pined and pined away. “Death! to the happy thou art terrible; But how the wretched love to think of thee Oh thou true comforter, the friend of all Who have no friend beside! By the sick bed Of Madelon I sat, when sure she felt The hour of her deliverance drawing near; I saw her eye kindle with heavenly hope, I had her latest look of earthly love, I felt her hand's last pressure.... Son of Orleans! I would not wish to live to know that hour, When I could think upon a dear friend dead, And weep not: but they are not bitter tears, . . . Not painful now; for Christ hath risen, first fruits Of them that slept; and we shall meet again, Meet, not again to part: the Grave hath lost It's victory. “I remember as her bier Went to the grave, a lark sprung up aloft, And soar'd amid the sunshine, carolling So full of joy, that to the mourner's ear More mournfully than dirge or passing bell, The joyous carol came, and made us feel That of the multitude of beings, none But man was wretched. “Then my soul awoke, For it had slumber'd long in happiness, And never feeling misery, never thought What others suffer. I, as best I might, Solaced the keen regret of Elinor; And much my cares avail'd, and much her son's, On whom, the only comfort of her age, She center'd now her love. A younger birth, Aged nearly as myself was Theodore, An ardent youth, who with the kindest care Had sooth'd his sister's sorrow. We had knelt By her death-bed together, and no bond In closer union knits two human hearts Than fellowship in grief. “It chanced as once Beside the fire of Elinor I sat, The night was comfortless, the loud blast howl'd, And as we drew around the social hearth, We heard the rain beat hard. Driven by the storm A warrior mark'd our distant taper's light; We heapt the fire, and spread the friendly board. ‘'Tis a rude night;’ the stranger cried: ‘safe housed Pleasant it is to hear the pelting rain. I too could be content to dwell in peace, Resting my head upon the lap of love, But that my country calls. When the winds roar, Remember sometimes what a soldier suffers, And think on Conrade.’ “Theodore replied, ‘Success go with thee! Something we have known Of war, and tasted its calamity; And I am well content to dwell in peace, Albeit inglorious, thanking the good God Who made me to be happy.’ “Did that God’ Cried Conrade, ‘form thy heart for happiness, When Desolation royally careers Over thy wretched country? Did that God Form thee for Peace when Slaughter is abroad, When her brooks run with blood, and Rape, and Murder, Stalk through her flaming towns? Live thou in peace, Young man! my heart is human: I must feel For what my brethren suffer.’ While he spake Such mingled passions character'd his face Of fierce and terrible benevolence, That I did tremble as I listen'd to him. And in my heart tumultuous thoughts arose Of high achievements, indistinct, and wild, And vast, . . yet such they were as made me pant As though by some divinity possess'd. ‘But is there not some duty due to those We love?’ said Theodore; ‘Is there an employ More righteous than to cheer declining age, And thus with filial tenderness repay Parental care?’ “Hard is it,’ Conrade cried, Ay, hard indeed, to part from those we love; And I have suffer'd that severest pang. I have left an aged mother; I have left One upon whom my heart has fasten'd all Its dearest, best affections. Should I live Till France shall see the blessed hour of peace, I shall return; my heart will be content, My duties then will have been well discharged, And I may then be happy. There are those Who deem such thoughts the fancies of a mind Strict beyond measure, and were well content, If I should soften down my rigid nature Even to inglorious ease, to honour me. But pure of heart and high in self-esteem I must be honour'd by myself: all else, The breath of Fame, is as the unsteady wind Worthless.’ “So saying from his belt he took The encumbering sword. I held it, listening to him, And wistless what I did, half from the sheath Drew forth its glittering blade. I gazed upon it, And shuddering, as I touch'd its edge, exclaim'd, How horrible it is with the keen sword To gore the finely-fibred human frame! I could not strike a lamb. “He answer'd me ‘Maiden, thou sayest well. I could not strike A lamb! . . But when the merciless invader Spares not grey age, and mocks the infant's shriek As it doth writhe upon his cursed lance, And forces to his foul embrace the wife Even where her slaughter'd husband bleeds to death, Almighty God! I should not be a man If I did let one weak and pitiful feeling Make mine arm impotent to cleave him down. Think well of this, young man!’ he cried, and took The hand of Theodore; ‘think well of this; As you are human, as you hope to live In peace, amid the dearest joys of home, Think well of this! You have a tender mother; As you do wish that she may die in peace, As you would even to madness agonize To hear this maiden call on you in vain For help, and see her dragg'd, and hear her scream In the blood-reeking soldier's lustful grasp, Think that there are such horrors! that even now, Some city flames, and haply, as in Roan, Some famish'd babe on his dead mother's breast Yet hangs and pulls for food! . . Woe be to those By whom the evil comes! And woe to him, . . For little less his guilt, . . who dwells in peace, When every arm is needed for the strife!’ “When we had all betaken us to rest, Sleepless I lay, and in my mind revolved The high-soul'd warrior's speech. Then Madelon Rose in remembrance; over her the grave Had closed; her sorrows were not register'd In the rolls of fame; but when the tears run down The widow's cheek, shall not her cry be heard In Heaven against the oppressor? will not God In sunder smite the unmerciful, and break The sceptre of the wicked? . . Thoughts like these Possess'd my soul, till at the break of day I slept; nor did my heated brain repose Even then; for visions, sent, as I believe, From the Most-High, arose. A high-tower'd town Hemm'd in and girt with enemies, I saw, Where Famine on a heap of carcasses, Half envious of the unutterable feast, Mark'd the gorged raven clog his beak with gore. I turn'd me then to the besieger's camp, And there was revelry: a loud lewd laugh Burst on mine ear, and beheld the chiefs Sit at their feast, and plan the work of death. My soul grew sick within me; I look'd up, Reproaching Heaven, . . lo! from the clouds an arm As of the avenging Angel was put forth, And from his hand a sword, like lightning, fell. “From that night I could feel my burthen'd soul Heaving beneath incumbent Deity. I sate in silence, musing on the days To come, unheeding and unseeing all Around me, in that dreaminess of thought When every bodily sense is as it slept, And the mind alone is wakeful. I have heard Strange voices in the evening wind; strange forms Dimly discover'd throng'd the twilight air. The neighbours wonder'd at the sudden change, They call'd me crazed; and my dear Uncle too, Would sit and gaze upon me wistfully, A heaviness upon his aged brow, And in his eye such sorrow, that my heart Sometimes misgave me. I had told him all The mighty future labouring in my breast, But that the hour, methought, not yet was come. “At length I heard of Orleans, by the foe Wall'd in from human help: thither all thoughts All hopes were turn'd; that bulwark beaten down, All were the invaders. Then my troubled soul Grew more disturb'd, and shunning every eye, I loved to wander where the woodland shade Was deepest, there on mightiest deeds to brood Of shadowy vastness, such as made my heart Throb loud: anon I paused, and in a state Of half expectance, listen'd to the wind. “There is a fountain in the forest call'd The Fountain of the Fairies: when a child With a delightful wonder I have heard Tales of the Elfin tribe who on its banks Hold midnight revelry. An ancient oak, The goodliest of the forest, grows beside; Alone it stands, upon a green grass plat, By the woods bounded like some little isle. It ever hath been deem'd their favourite tree, They love to lie and rock upon its leaves, And bask in moonshine. Here the Woodman leads His boy, and shewing him the green-sward mark'd With darker circlets, says their midnight dance Hath traced the rings, and bids him spare the tree. Fancy had cast a spell upon the place Which made it holy; and the villagers Would say that never evil thing approach'd Unpunish'd there. The strange and fearful pleasure Which fill'd me by that solitary spring, Ceased not in riper years; and now it woke Deeper delight, and more mysterious awe. “A blessed spot! Oh how my soul enjoy'd Its holy quietness, with what delight Escaping from mankind I hasten'd there To solitude and freedom! Thitherward On a spring eve I had betaken me, And there I sat, and mark'd the deep red clouds Gather before the wind.. the rising wind, Whose sudden gusts, each wilder than the last, Appear'd to rock my senses. Soon the night Darken'd around, and the large rain-drops fell Heavy; anon tempestuously the gale Swept o'er the wood. Methought the thunder-shower Fell with refreshing coolness on my head, And the hoarse dash of waters, and the rush Of winds that mingled with the forest roar, Made a wild music. On a rock I sat, The glory of the tempest fill'd my soul; And when the thunders peal'd, and the long flash Hung durable in heaven, and on my sight Spread the grey forest, memory, thought, were gone, All sense of self annihilate, I seem'd Diffused into the scene. “At length a light Approach'd the spring; I saw my Uncle Claude; His grey locks dripping with the midnight storm, He came, and caught me in his arms, and cried ‘My God! my child is safe! “I felt his words Pierce in my heart; my soul was overcharged; I fell upon his neck and told him all; God was within me, as I felt, I spake, And he believed. “Aye, Chieftain! and the world Shall soon believe my mission; for the Lord Will raise up indignation and pour on't His wrath, and they shall perish who oppress.” THE SECOND BOOK. And now beneath the horizon westering slow Had sunk the orb of day: o'er all the vale A purple softness spread, save where some tree Its lengthen'd shadow stretch'd, or winding strean Mirror'd the light of Heaven, still traced distinct When twilight dimly shrouded all beside. A grateful coolness freshen'd the calm air, And the hoarse grasshoppers their evening song Sung shrill and ceaseless, as the dews of night Descended. On their way the travellers wend, Cheering the road with converse, till at length They mark a cottage lamp whose steady light Shone through the lattice; thitherward they turn There came an old man forth; his thin grey locks Moved to the breeze and on his wither'd face The characters of age were written deep. Them, louting low with rustic courtesy, He welcomed in; on the white-ember'd hearth Heapt up fresh fuel, then with friendly care Spread out his homely board, and fill'd the bowl With the red produce of the vine that arch'd His evening seat; they of the plain repast Partook, and quaff'd the pure and pleasant draught. “Strangers, your fare is homely,” said their Host, “But such it is as we poor countrymen Earn with our toil: in faith ye are welcome to it! I too have borne a lance in younger days; And would that I were young again to meet These haughty English in the field of fight; Such as I was when on the fatal plain Of Agincourt I met them. “Wert thou then A sharer in that dreadful day's defeat?” Exclaim'd the Bastard: “Didst thou know the Lord Of Orleans?” “Know him?” cried the veteran, “I saw him ere the bloody fight began Riding from rank to rank, his beaver up, The long lance quivering in his mighty grasp. His eye was wrathful to an enemy, But for his countrymen it had a smile Would win all hearts. Looking at thee, Sir Knight, Methinks I see him now; such was his eye, Gentle in peace, and such his manly brow.” “No tongue but speaketh honour of that name!” Exclaim'd Dunois. “Strangers and countrymen Alike revered the good and gallant Chief. His vassals like a father loved their Lord; His gates stood open to the traveller; The pilgrim when he saw his towers rejoiced, For he had heard in other lands the fame Of Orleans... And he lives a prisoner still! Losing all hope because my arm so long Hath fail'd to win his liberty!” He turn'd His head away, hiding the burning shame Which flush'd his face. “But he shall live, Dunois,” The mission'd Maid replied; “but he shall live To hear good tidings; hear of liberty, Of his own liberty, by his brother's arm Atchieved in well-won battle. He shall live Happy, the memory of his prison'd years Shall heighten all his joys, and his grey hairs Go to the grave in peace.” “I would fain live To see that day,” replied their aged host: “How would my heart leap to behold again The gallant generous chieftain! I fought by him, When all our hopes of victory were lost, And down his batter'd arms the blood stream'd fast From many a wound. Like wolves they hemm'd us in, Fierce in unhoped-for conquest: all around Our dead and dying countrymen lay heap'd; Yet still he strove; . . I wonder'd at his valour! There was not one who on that fatal day Fought bravelier.” “Fatal was that day to France,” Exclaim'd the Bastard; “there Alencon fell, Valiant in vain; there D'Albert, whose mad pride Brought the whole ruin on. There fell Brabant, Vaudemont, and Marle, and Bar, and Faquenberg, Our noblest warriors; the determin'd foe Fought for revenge, not hoping victory, Desperately brave; ranks fell on ranks before them; The prisoners of that shameful day out-summ'd Their conquerors!” “Yet believe not,” Bertram cried, “That cowardice disgraced thy countrymen! They by their leaders arrogance led on With heedless fury, found all numbers vain, All effort fruitless there; and hadst thou seen, Skilful as brave, how Henry's ready eye Lost not a thicket, not a hillock's aid; From his hersed bowmen how the arrows flew Thick as the snow-flakes and with lightning force; Thou wouldst have known such soldiers, such a chief, Could never be subdued. “But when the field Was won, and they who had escaped the fight Had yielded up their arms, it was foul work To turn on the defenceless prisoners The cruel sword of conquest. Girt around I to their mercy had surrender'd me, When lo! I heard the dreadful cry of death. Not as amid the fray, when man met man And in fair combat gave the mortal blow; Here the poor captives, weaponless and bound, Saw their stern victors draw again the sword, And groan'd and strove in vain to free their hands, And bade them think upon their plighted faith, And pray'd for mercy in the name of God, In vain: the King had bade them massacre, And in their helpless prisoners' naked breasts They drove the weapon. Then I look'd for death, And at that moment death was terrible, . . For the heat of fight was over; of my home I thought, and of my wife and little ones In bitterness of heart. But the brave man, To whom the chance of war had made me thrall, Had pity, loosed my hands, and bade me fly. It was the will of Heaven that I should live Childless and old to think upon the past, And wish that I had perish'd!” The old man Wept as he spake. “Ye may perhaps have heard Of the hard siege that Roan so long endur'd. I dwelt there, strangers; I had then a wife, And I had children tenderly beloved, Who I did hope should cheer me in old age And close mine eyes. The tale of misery May-hap were tedious, or I could relate Much of that dreadful time.” The Maid replied, Wishing of that devoted town to hear. Thus then the veteran: “So by Heaven preserved, From the disastrous plain of Agincourt I speeded homewards, and abode in peace. Henry, as wise as brave, had back to England Led his victorious army; well aware That France was mighty, that her warlike sons, Impatient of a foreigner's command, Might rise impetuous, and with multitudes Tread down the invaders. Wisely he return'd, For our proud barons in their private broils Wasted the strength of France. I dwelt at home, And with the little I possess'd content, Lived happily. A pleasant sight it was To see my children, as at eve I sat Beneath the vine, come clustering round my knee, That they might hear again the oft-told tale Of the dangers I had past: their little eyes Would with such anxious eagerness attend The tale of life preserved, as made me feel Life's value. My poor children! a hard fate Had they! But oft and bitterly I wish That God had to his mercy taken me In childhood, for it is a heavy lot To linger out old age in loneliness! Ah me! when war the masters of mankind, Woe to the poor man! if he sow his field, He shall not reap the harvest; if he see His offspring rise around, his boding heart Aches at the thought that they are multiplied To the sword! Again from England the fierce foe Came on our ravaged coasts. In battle bold, Merciless in conquest, their victorious King Swept like the desolating tempest round. Dambieres submits; on Caen's subjected wall The flag of England waved. Roan still remain'd, Embattled Roan, bulwark of Normandy; Nor unresisted round her massy walls Pitch'd they their camp. I need not tell, Sir Knight How oft and boldly on the invading host We burst with fierce assault impetuous forth, For many were the warlike sons of Roan. One gallant Citizen was famed o'er all For daring hardihood pre-eminent, Blanchard. He, gathering round his countrymen, With his own courage kindling every breast, Had made them vow before Almighty God Never to yield them to the usurping foe. Before the God of Hosts we made the vow; And we had baffled the besieging power, Had not the patient enemy drawn round His wide intrenchments. From the watch-tower's top In vain with fearful hearts along the Seine We strain'd the eye, and every distant wave Which in the sun-beam glitter'd, fondly thought The white sail of supply. Alas! no more The white sail rose upon our aching sight; For guarded was the Seine, and our stern foe Had made a league with Famine. How my heart Sunk in me when at night I carried home The scanty pittance of to-morrow's meal! You know not, strangers, what it is to see The asking eye of hunger! “Still we strove, Expecting aid; nor longer force to force, Valour to valour, in the fight opposed, But to the exasperate patience of the foe, Desperate endurance. Though with christian zeal Ursino would have pour'd the balm of peace Into our wounds, Ambition's ear, best pleased With the war's clamour and the groan of death, Was deaf to prayer. Day after day pass'd on; We heard no voice of comfort. From the walls Could we behold their savage Irish Kerns, Ruffians half-clothed, half-human, half-baptized, Come with their spoil, mingling their hideous shouts With moan of weary flocks, and piteous low Of kine sore-laden, in the mirthful camp Scattering abundance; while the loathliest food We prized above all price; while in our streets The dying groan of hunger, and the cries Of famishing infants echoed, . . and we heard, With the strange selfishness of misery, We heard, and heeded not. “Thou wouldst have deem'd Roan must have fallen an easy sacrifice, Young warrior! hadst thou seen our meagre limbs And pale and shrunken cheeks, and hollow eyes; Yet still we struggled bravely! Blanchard still Spake of the obdurate temper of the foe, Of Harfleur's wretched people driven out Houseless and destitute, while that stern King Knelt at the altar, and with impious prayer Gave God the glory, even while the blood That he had shed was reeking up to Heaven. He bade us think what mercy they had found Who yielded on the plain of Agincourt, And what the gallant sons of Caen, by him, In cold blood slaughter'd: then his scanty food Sharing with the most wretched, he would bid us Bear with our miseries manfully. “Thus press'd, Lest all should perish thus, our chiefs decreed Women and children, the infirm and old, All who were useless in the work of war, Should forth and take their fortune. Age, that makes The joys and sorrows of the distant years Like a half-remember'd dream, yet on my heart Leaves deep impress'd the horrors of that hour. Then as our widow-wives clung round our necks, And the deep sob of anguish interrupted The prayer of parting, even the pious priest As he implored his God to strengthen us, And told us we should meet again in Heaven, He groan'd and curs'd in bitterness of heart That merciless King. The wretched crowd pass'd on; My wife.. my children.. through the gates they pass'd, Then the gates closed.. Would I were in my grave That I might lose remembrance! “What is man That he can hear the groan of wretchedness And feel no fleshly pang! Why did the All-Good Create these warrior scourges of mankind, These who delight in slaughter? I did think There was not on this earth a heart so hard Could hear a famish'd woman ask for food, And feel no pity. As the outcast train Drew near, relentless Henry bade his troops Drive back the miserable multitude. They drove them to the walls; . . . it was the depth Of winter, . . . we had no relief to grant. The aged ones groan'd to our foe in vain, The mother pleaded for her dying child, And they felt no remorse!” The mission'd Maid Rose from her seat, . . “The old and the infirm, The mother and her babes! . . and yet no lightning Blasted this man!” “Aye, Lady,” Bertram cried, “And when we sent the herald to implore His mercy on the helpless, his stern face Assum'd a sterner smile of callous scorn, And he replied in mockery. On the wall I stood and watch'd the miserable outcasts, And every moment thought that Henry's heart, Hard as it was, would melt. All night I stood, . . Their deep groans came upon the midnight gale; Fainter they grew, for the cold wintry wind Blew bleak; fainter they grew, and at the last All was still, save that ever and anon Some mother raised o'er her expiring child A cry of frenzying anguish. “From that hour On all the busy turmoil of the world I look'd with strange indifference; bearing want With the sick patience of a mind worn out. Nor when the traitor yielded up our town Aught heeded I as through our ruin'd streets, Through putrid heaps of famish'd carcases, The pomp of triumph pass'd. One pang alone I felt, when by that cruel King's command The gallant Blanchard died: calmly he died, And as he bow'd beneath the axe, thank'd God That he had done his duty. “I survive, A solitary, friendless, wretched one, Knowing no joy save in the certain hope That I shall soon be gather'd to my sires, And soon repose, there where the wicked cease From troubling, and the weary are at rest.” “And happy,” cried the delegated Maid, And happy they who in that holy faith Bow meekly to the rod! A little while Shall they endure the proud man's contumely, The injustice of the great: a little while Though shelterless they feel the wintry wind, The wind shall whistle o'er their turf-grown grave, And all be peace below. But woe to those, Woe to the Mighty Ones who send abroad Their ministers of death, and give to Fury The flaming firebrand; these indeed shall live The heroes of the wandering minstrel's song; But they have their reward; the innocent blood Steams up to Heaven against them: God shall hear The widow's groan.” “I saw him,” Bertram cried, “Henry of Agincourt, this mighty King, Go to his grave. The long procession pass'd Slowly from town to town, and when I heard The deep-toned dirge, and saw the banners wave A pompous shade, and the tall torches cast In the mid-day sun a dim and gloomy light, I thought what he had been on earth who now Was gone to his account, and blest my God I was not such as he!” So spake the old man, And then his guests betook them to repose. THE THIRD BOOK. Fair dawn'd the morning, and the early sun Pour'd on the latticed cot a cheerful gleam, And up the travellers rose, and on their way Hasten'd, their dangerous way, through fertile tracks Laid waste by war. They pass'd the Auxerrois; The autumnal rains had beaten to the earth The unreap'd harvest; from the village church No even-song bell was heard; the shepherd's dog Prey'd on the scatter'd flock, for there was now No hand to feed him, and upon the hearth Where he had slumber'd at his master's feet Weeds grew and reptiles crawl'd. Or if they found Sometimes a welcome, those who welcomed them Were old and helpless creatures, lingering there Where they were born, and where they wish'd to die, The place being all that they had left to love. They pass'd the Yonne, they pass'd the rapid Loire, Still urging on their way with cautious speed, Shunning Auxerre, and Bar's embattled wall, And Romorantin's towers. So journeying on, Fast by a spring, which welling at his feet With many a winding crept along the mead, A Knight they saw, who there at his repast Let the west wind play round his ungirt brow. Approaching near, the Bastard recognised That faithful friend of Orleans, the brave chief Du Chastel; and their mutual greeting pass'd, They on the streamlet's mossy bank reclined Beside him, and his frugal fare partook, And drank the running waters. “Art thou bound For the Court, Dunois?” exclaim'd the aged Knight; “I thought thou hadst been far away, shut up In Orleans, where her valiant sons the siege Right loyally endure!” “I left the town,” Dunois replied, “thinking that my prompt speed Might seize the enemy's stores, and with fresh force Re-enter. Fastolffe's better fate prevail'd, And from the field of shame my maddening horse Bore me, an arrow having pierced his flank. Worn out and faint with that day's dangerous toil, My deep wounds bleeding, vainly with weak hand I check'd the powerless rein. Nor aught avail'd When heal'd at length, defeated and alone Again to enter Orleans. In Lorraine I sought to raise new powers, and now return'd With strangest and most unexpected aid Sent by high Heaven, I seek the Court, and thence To that beleaguer'd town shall lead such force, That the proud English in their fields of blood Shall perish.” “I too,” Tanneguy reply'd, In the field of battle once again perchance May serve my royal Master; in his cause My youth adventur'd much, nor can my age Find better close than in the clang of arms To die for him whom I have lived to serve. Thou art for the Court. Son of the Chief I loved! Be wise by my experience. He who seeks Court-favour, ventures like a boy who leans Over the brink of some high precipice To reach the o'er-hanging fruit. Thou seest me here A banish'd man, Dunois! so to appease Richemont, who jealous of the royal ear, With midnight murder leagues, and down the Loire Sends the black carcass of his strangled foe. Now confident of strength, at the King's feet He stabs the King's best friends, and then demands, As with a conqueror's imperious tone, The post of honour. Son of that good Duke Whose death my arm avenged, may all thy days Be happy; serve thy country in the field, But in the hour of peace amid thy friends Dwell thou without ambition.” So he spake. But when the Bastard told his wonderous tale, How interposing Heaven had its high aid Vouchsafed to France, the old man's eyes flash'd fire, And rising from the bank, his ready steed That grazed beside he mounted. “Farewell friend, And thou, the Delegate of Heaven!” he cried. “I go to do my part, and we shall meet At Orleans.” Saying thus, he spurr'd away. They journey on their way till Chinon's towers Rose on the distant view; the royal seat Of Charles, while Paris with her servile sons, A headstrong, mutable, ferocious race, Bow'd to the invader's yoke; City even then Above all Cities noted for dire deeds! Yet doom'd to be the scene of blacker guilt, Opprobry more enduring, crimes that call'd For heavier vengeance, than in those dark days When the Burgundian faction fill'd thy streets With carnage. Twice hast thou since then been made A horror and a warning to all lands; When kingly power conspired with papal craft To plot and perpetrate that massacre, Which neither change of kalendar, nor lapse Of time, shall hide from memory, or efface; And when in more enlighten'd days, . . so deem'd, So vaunted, . . the astonish'd nations saw A people, to their own devices left, Therefore as by judicial frenzy stricken, Lawless and godless, fill the whole wide realm With terror, and with wickedness and woe, . . A more astounding judgement than when Heaven Shower'd on the cities of the accursed plain Its fire and sulphur down. In Paris now The Invader triumph'd. On an infant's head Had Bedford placed the crown of Charlemagne, And factious nobles bow'd the subject knee, And own'd an English infant for their King, False to their own liege Lord. “Beloved of Heaven,” Then said the Son of Orleans to the Maid, “Lo these the walls of Chinon, this the abode Of Charles our monarch. Here in revelry He of his armies vanquish'd, his fair towns Subdued, hears careless and prolongs the dance. And little marvel I that to the cares Of empire still he turns the unwilling ear, For loss on loss, defeat upon defeat, His strong holds taken, and his bravest Chiefs Or slain or captured, and the hopes of youth All blasted have subdued the royal mind Undisciplined in Fortitude's stern school. So may thy voice arouse his sleeping virtue!” The mission'd Maid replied, “Do thou, Dunois, Announce my mission to the royal ear. I on the river's winding bank the while Will roam, collecting for the interview My thoughts, though firm, yet troubled. Who essays Achievements of great import will perforce Feel the heart heave; and in my breast I own Such perturbation.” On the banks of Vienne Devious the Damsel turn'd, while through the gate The Son of Orleans press'd with hasty step To seek the King. Him from the public view He found secluded with his blameless Queen, And his partaker of the unlawful bed, The lofty-minded Agnes. “Son of Orleans!” So as he enter'd cried the haughty fair, Thou art well come to witness the disgrace, The weak, unmanly, base despondency Of this thy Sovereign Liege. He will retreat To distant Dauphiny and fly the war! Go then, unworthy of thy rank! retreat To distant Dauphiny and fly the war, Recreant from battle! I will not partake A fugitive's fate; when thou hast lost thy crown Thou losest Agnes.—Do'st not blush, Dunois! To bleed in combat for a Prince like this, Fit only like the Merovingian race On a May morning deck'd with flowers, to mount His gay-bedizen'd car, and ride abroad And make the multitude a holiday. Go Charles! and hide thee in a woman's garb, And these long locks will not disgrace thee then!” “Nay, Agnes!” Charles replied, “reproach me not! I have enough of sorrow. Look around, See this fair country ravaged by the foe, My strong holds taken, and my bravest friends Fallen in the field, or captives far away. Dead is the Douglas; cold thy gallant heart, Illustrious Buchan! ye from Scotland's hills, Not mindless of your old ally distress'd, Came to his succour; in his cause ye fought, For him ye perish'd. Rash impetuous Narbonne! Thy mangled corse waves to the winds of Heaven. Cold, Graville, is thy sinewy arm in death; Fallen is Ventadaur; silent in the grave Rambouillet sleeps. Bretagne's unfaithful chief Leagues with my foes; and Richemont, or in arms Defies my weak controul, or from my side, A friend more dreaded than the enemy, Scares my best servants with the assassin's sword. Soon must beleaguer'd Orleans fall.—But now A truce to these sad thoughts! We are not yet So utterly despoil'd but we can spread The friendly board, and giving thee, Dunois, Such welcome as befits thy father's son Win from our public cares a day for joy. Dunois replied, “So may thy future years Pass from misfortune free, as all these ills Shall vanish like a vision of the night! I come to thee the joyful messenger Of aid from Heaven; for Heaven hath delegated A humble Maiden to deliver France. That holy Maiden asks an audience now; And when she promises miraculous things, I feel it is not possible to hear And disbelieve.” Astonish'd by his speech Stood Charles. “At one of meaner estimation I should have smiled, Dunois,” the King replied; “But thy known worth, and the tried loyalty Of thy father's house, compel me even to this To lend a serious ear. A woman sent To rescue us, when all our strength hath fail'd! A humble Maiden to deliver France! One whom it were not possible to hear, And disbelieve! . . Dunois, ill now beseems Aught wild and hazardous. And yet our state Being what it is, by miracle alone Deliverance can be hoped for. Is my person Known to this woman?” “That it cannot be, Unless it be by miracle made known,” Dunois replied; “for she hath never left Her native hamlet in Lorraine till now.” “Here then,” rejoin'd the King, “we have a test Easy, and safe withal. Abide thou here; And hither by a speedy messenger Summon the Prophetess. Upon the throne Let some one take his seat and personate My presence, while I mingle in the train. If she indeed be by the Spirit moved, That Spirit, certes, will direct her eyes To the true Prince whom she is sent to serve: But if she prove, as likeliest we must deem, One by her own imaginations crazed, Thus failing and convinced, she may return Unblamed to her obscurity, and we Be spared the shame of farther loss incurr'd By credulous faith. Well might the English scoff, If on a frantic woman we should rest Our last reliance.” Thus the King resolved, And with a faith half-faltering at the proof, Dunois dispatch'd a messenger, to seek Beside the banks of Vienne, the mission'd Maid. Soon is the court convened: the jewell'd crown Shines on a courtier's head. Amid the train The Monarch undistinguish'd takes his place, Expectant of the event. The Virgin comes, And as the Bastard led her to the throne, Quick glancing o'er the mimic Majesty, With gesture and with look like one inspired She fix'd her eye on Charles: “Thou art the King!' Then in a tone that thrill'd all hearts, pursued; “I come the appointed Minister of Heaven, To wield a sword before whose fated edge, Far, far from Orleans shall the English wolves Speed their disastrous flight. Monarch of France! Send thou the tidings over all the realm, Great tidings of deliverance and of joy; The Maid is come, the mission'd Maid, whose hand Shall in the consecrated walls of Rheims Crown thee, anointed King.” In wonder mute The courtiers heard. Astonish'd Charles exclaim'd, “This is indeed the agency of Heaven! Hard, Maiden, were I of belief,” he said, “Did I not now, with full and confirm'd faith, Receive thee as a Prophetess raised up For our deliverance. Therefore, not in doubt Of Providence or thee do I delay At once to marshal our brave countrymen Beneath thy banner; but to satisfy Those who at distance from this most clear proof Might hear and disbelieve, or yield at best A cold assent. These fully to confirm, And more to make thy calling manifest, Forth with with all due speed I will convene The Doctors of Theology, wise men, And learned in the mysteries of Heaven. By them thy mission studied and approved, As needs it must, their sanction to all minds Will bring conviction, and the sure belief Lead on thy favour'd troops to mightiest deeds, Surpassing human possibility.” Well pleas'd the Maiden heard. Her the King leads From the disbanding throng, meantime to dwell With Mary. Watchful for her Lord's return She sat with Agnes; Agnes proud of heart, Majestically fair, whose large full eye Or flashing anger, or with scornful scowl Too oft deform'd her beauty. Yet with her The lawless idol of the Monarch's heart, The Queen, obedient to her husband's will, Dwelt meekly in accord. With them the Maid Was left to sojourn; by the gentle Queen With cordial affability received; By Agnes courteously, whose outward show Of graciousness concealed an inward awe, For while she hoped and trusted through her means Charles should be re-establish'd in his realm, She felt rebuked before her. Through the land Meantime the King's convoking voice went forth, And from their palaces and monasteries The theologians came, men who had grown In midnight studies grey; Prelates and Priests And Doctors: teachers grave and with great names, Seraphic, Subtile, or Irrefragable, By their admiring scholars dignified. They met convened at Chinon, to the place Of judgement, in St. Katharine's fane assign'd. The floor with many a monumental stone Was spread, and brass-ensculptured effigies Of holy abbots honour'd in their day, Now to the grave gone down. The branching arms Of many a ponderous pillar met aloft, Wreath'd on the roof emboss'd. Through storied panes Of high arch'd windows came the tinctured light; Pure water in a font beneath reflects The many-colour'd rays; around that font The fathers stand, and there with rites ordain'd And signs symbolic strew the hallowing salt, Wherewith the limpid water, consecrate, So taught the Church, became a spell approved Against the fiends of Satan's fallen crew; A licit spell of mightier potency Than e'er the hell-hags taught in Thessaly; Or they who sitting on the rifled grave, By the blue tomb-fire's lurid light dim seen, Share with the Gouls their banquet. This perform'd, The Maid is summon'd. Round the sacred font, Mark'd with the mystic tonsure and enrobed In sacred vests, a venerable train, They stand. The delegated Maid obeys Their summons. As she came, a blush suffused Her pallid cheek, such as might well beseem One mindful still of maiden modesty, Though to her mission true. Before the train In reverent silence waiting their sage will, With half-averted eye she stood composed. So have I seen a single snow-drop rise Amid the russet leaves that hide the earth In early spring, so seen it gently bend In modest loveliness alone amid The waste of winter. By the Maiden's side The Son of Orleans stood, prepared to vouch That when on Charles the Maiden's eye had fix'd, As led by power miraculous, no fraud, Nor juggling artifice of secret sign Dissembled inspiration. As he stood Steadily viewing the mysterious rites, Thus to the attentive Maid the President Severely spake. “If any fiend of Hell Lurk in thy bosom, so to prompt the vaunt Of inspiration, and to mock the power Of God and holy Church, thus by the virtue Of water hallowed in the name of God Adjure I that foul spirit to depart From his deluded prey.” Slowly he spake And sprinkled water on the virgin's face. Indignant at the unworthy charge the Maid Felt her cheek flush, but soon, the transient glow Fading, she answer'd meek. “Most holy Sires, Ye reverend Fathers of the Christian church, Most catholic! I stand before you here A poor weak woman; of the grace vouchsafed, How far unworthy, conscious; yet though mean, Innocent of fraud, and call'd by Heaven to be It's minister of aid. Strange voices heard, The dark and shadowing visions of the night, And feelings which I may not dare to doubt, These portents make me certain of the God Within me; He who to these eyes reveal'd My royal Master, mingled with the crowd And never seen till then. Such evidence Given to my mission thus, and thus confirm'd By public attestation, more to say, Methinks, would little boot, . . and less become A silly Maid.” “Thou speakest,” said the Priest, “Of dark and shadowing visions of the night. Canst thou remember, Maid, what vision first Seem'd more than fancy's shaping? From such tale, Minutely told with accurate circumstance, Some judgement might be form'd.” The Maid replied: “Amid the mountain vallies I had driven My father's flock. The eve was drawing on, When by a sudden storm surprised, I sought A chapel's neighbouring shelter; ruin'd now, But I remember when its vesper bell Was heard among the hills, a pleasant sound, That made me pause upon my homeward road, A wakening in me comfortable thoughts Of holiness. The unsparing soldiery Had sack'd the hamlet near, and none was left Duly at sacred seasons to attend St. Agnes' chapel. In the desolate pile I drove my flock, with no irreverent thoughts, Nor mindless that the place on which I trod Was holy ground. It was a fearful night! Devoutly to the virgin Saint I pray'd, Then heap'd the wither'd leaves which autumn winds Had drifted in, and laid me down upon them, And sure I think I slept. But so it was That, in the dead of night, Saint Agnes stood Before mine eyes, such and so beautiful As when, amid the house of wickedness, The Power whom with such fervent love she served Veil'd her with glory. And I saw her point To the moss-grown altar, and the crucifix Half hid by weeds and grass; . . and then I thought I could have wither'd armies with a look, For from the present Saint such divine power I felt infused.... 'Twas but a dream perhaps. And yet methought that when a louder peal Burst o'er the roof, and all was left again Utterly dark, the bodily sense was clear And accurate in every circumstance Of time and place.” Attentive to her words Thus the Priest answer'd: “Brethren ye have heard The woman's tale. Behoves us now to ask Whether of holy Church a duteous child Before our court appears, so not unlike Heaven might vouchsafe its gracious miracle; Or misbelieving heretic whose thoughts, Erring and vain, easily might stray beyond All reason, and conceit strange dreams and signs Impossible. Say, woman, from thy youth Hast thou, as rightly mother Church demands, Confess'd at stated times thy secret sins, And, from the priestly power conferr'd by Heaven, Sought absolution?” “Father,” she replied, “The forms of worship in mine earlier years Waked my young mind to artificial awe, And made me fear my God. Warm with the glow Of health and exercise, whene'er I pass'd The threshold of the house of prayer, I felt A cold damp chill me; I beheld the tapers That with a pale and feeble glimmering Dimm'd the noon-light; I heard the solemn mass, And with strange feelings and mysterious dread Telling my beads, gave to the mystic prayers Devoutest meaning. Often when I saw The pictured flames writhe round a penanced soul, I knelt in fear before the Crucifix And wept and pray'd, and trembled, and adored A God of Terrors. But in riper years, When as my soul grew strong in solitude, I saw the eternal energy pervade The boundless range of nature, with the sun Pour life and radiance from his flamey path, And on the lowliest flowret of the field The kindly dew-drops shed. And then I felt That he who form'd this goodly frame of things Must needs be good, and with a Father's name I call'd on him, and from my burthen'd heart Pour'd out the yearnings of unmingled love. Methinks it is not strange then, that I fled The house of prayer, and made the lonely grove My temple, at the foot of some old oak Watching the little tribes that had their world Within its mossy bark; or laid me down Beside the rivulet whose murmuring Was silence to my soul, and mark'd the swarm Whose light-edged shadows on the bedded sand Mirror'd their mazy sports, . . the insect hum, The flow of waters, and the song of birds Making a holy music to mine ear: Oh! was it strange, if for such scenes as these, Such deep devoutness, such intense delight Of quiet adoration, I forsook The house of worship? strange that when I felt How God had made my spirit quick to feel And love whate'er was beautiful and good, And from aught evil and deform'd to shrink Even as with instinct; . . father! was it strange That in my heart I had no thought of sin And did not need forgiveness?” As she spake The Doctors stood astonish'd, and some while They listen'd still in wonder. But at length A Monk replied, “Woman, thou seem'st to scorn The ordinances of our holy Church; And, if I rightly understand thy words, Nature, thou say'st, taught thee in solitude Thy feelings of religion, and that now Masses and absolution and the use Of the holy wafer, are to thee unknown. But how could Nature teach thee true religion, Deprived of these? Nature doth lead to sin, But 'tis the Priest alone can teach remorse, Can bid St. Peter ope the gates of Heaven, And from the penal fires of purgatory Set the soul free. Could Nature teach thee this? Or tell thee that St. Peter holds the keys, And that his successor's unbounded power Extends o'er either world? Although thy life Of sin were free, if of this holy truth Ignorant, thy soul in liquid flames must rue It's error.” Thus he spake; applauding looks Went round. Nor dubious to reply the Maid Was silent. “Fathers of the holy Church, If on these points abstruse a simple maid Like me should err, impute not you the crime To self-will'd reason, vaunting its own strength Above eternal wisdom. True it is That for long time I have not heard the sound Of mass high-chaunted, nor with trembling lips Partook the holy wafer: yet the birds Who to the matin ray prelusive pour'd Their joyous song, methought did warble forth Sweeter thanksgiving to Religion's ear In their wild melody of happiness, Than ever rung along the high-arch'd roofs Of man: . . yet never from the bending vine Pluck'd I its ripen'd clusters thanklessly, Or of that God unmindful, who bestow'd The bloodless banquet. Ye have told me, Sirs, That Nature only teaches man to sin! If it be sin to seek the wounded lamb, To bind its wounds, and bathe them with my tears, This is what Nature taught! No, Fathers, no! It is not Nature that doth lead to sin: Nature is all benevolence, all love, All beauty! In the greenwood's quiet shade There is no vice that to the indignant cheek Bids the red current rush; no misery there; No wretched mother, who with pallid face And famine-fallen hangs o'er her hungry babes, With such a look, so wan, so woe-begone, As shall one day, with damning eloquence, Against the oppressor plead! . . . Nature teach sin! Oh blasphemy against the Holy One, Who made us in the image of Himself, Who made us all for happiness and love, Infinite happiness, infinite love, Partakers of his own eternity.” Solemn and slow the reverend Priest replied, “Much, woman, do I doubt that all-wise Heaven Would thus vouchsafe its gracious miracles On one fore-doom'd to misery; for so doom'd Is that deluded one, who, of the mass Unheeding, and the Church's saving power, Deems nature sinless. Therefore, mark me well! Brethren, I would propose this woman try The holy ordeal. Let her, bound and search'd, Lest haply in her clothes should be conceal'd Some holy relic so profaned, be cast In some deep pond; there if she float, no doubt The fiend upholds, but if at once she sink, It is a sign that Providence displays Her free from witchcraft. This done, let her walk Blindfold and bare o'er ploughshares heated red, And o'er these past her naked arm immerse In scalding water. If from these she come Unhurt, to holy father of the church, Most blessed Pope, we then refer the cause For judgement: and this Chief, the Son of Orleans, Who comes to vouch the royal person known By her miraculous power, shall pass with her The sacred trial.” “Grace of God!” exclaim'd The astonish'd Bastard; “plunge me in the pool, O'er red-hot ploughshares make me skip to please Your dotard fancies! Fathers of the church, Where is your gravity? what! elder-like Would ye this fairer than Susannah eye? Ye call for ordeals; and I too demand The noblest ordeal, on the English host By victory to approve her mission sent From favouring Heaven. To the Pope refer For judgement! Know ye not that France even now Stands tottering on destruction!” Starting then With a wild look, the mission'd Maid exclaim'd, “The sword of God is here! the grave shall speak To manifest me!” Even as she spake, A pale blue flame rose from the trophied tomb Beside her: and within that house of death A sound of arms was heard, as if below A warrior buried in his armour, stirr'd. “Hear ye?” the Damsel cried; “these are the arms Which shall flash terror o'er the hostile host. These, in the presence of our Lord the King, And of the assembled people, I will take Here from the sepulchre, where many an age, They, incorruptible, have lain conceal'd, For me reserved, the Delegate of Heaven.” Recovering from amaze, the Priest replied: “Thou art indeed the Delegate of Heaven! What thou hast said surely thou shalt perform. We ratify thy mission. Go in peace.” THE FOURTH BOOK. The feast was spread, the sparkling bowl went round, And in the assembled court the minstrel harp'd A song of other days. Sudden they heard The horn's loud blast. “This is no time for cares; Feast ye the messenger without!” cried Charles, “Enough hath of the wearying day been given To the public weal.” Obedient to the King The guard invites the way-worn messenger. “Nay, I will see the monarch,” he replied, “And he must hear my tidings; duty-urged, I have for many a long league hasten'd on, Not thus to be repell'd.” Then with strong arm Removing him who barr'd his onward way, The hall he enter'd. “King of France! I come From Orleans, speedy and effectual aid Demanding for her gallant garrison, Faithful to thee, though thinn'd in many a fight, And now sore pressed by want. Rouse thou thyself. And with the spirit that becomes a King Responsive to his people's loyalty, Bring succour to the brave who in thy cause Abide the extremity of war.” He said, And from the hall departing, in amaze At his audacious bearing left the court. The King exclaim'd, “But little need to send Quick succour to this gallant garrison, If to the English half so firm a front They bear in battle!” “In the field, my liege,” Dunois replied, “yon Knight hath serv'd thee well. Him have I seen the foremost of the fight, Wielding so manfully his battle-axe, That wheresoe'er he turn'd, the affrighted foe Let fall their palsied arms with powerless stroke, Desperate of safety. I do marvel much That he is here: Orleans must be hard press'd To send the bravest of her garrison, On such commission.” Swift the Maid exclaim'd, “I tell thee, Chief, that there the English wolves Shall never raise their yells of victory! The will of God defends those fated walls, And resting in full faith on that high will, I mock their efforts. But the night draws on; Retire we to repose. To-morrow's sun, Breaking the darkness of the sepulchre, Shall on that armour gleam, through many an age There for this great emergency reserved.” She said, and rising from the board, retired. Meantime the herald's brazen voice proclaim'd Coming solemnity, and far and wide Spread the glad tidings. Then all labour ceased; The ploughman from the unfinish'd furrow hastes; The armourer's anvil beats no more the din Of future slaughter. Through the thronging streets The buzz of asking wonder hums along. On to St. Katharine's sacred fane they go; The holy fathers with the imaged cross Leading the long procession. Next, as one Suppliant for mercy to the King of Kings, And grateful for the benefits of Heaven, The Monarch pass'd, and by his side the Maid; Her lovely limbs robed in a snow-white vest, Wistless that every eye on her was bent, With stately step she moved; her labouring soul To high thoughts elevate; and gazing round With a full eye, that of the circling throng And of the visible world unseeing, seem'd Fix'd upon objects seen by none beside. Near her the warlike Son of Orleans came Pre-eminent. He, nerving his young frame With exercise robust, had scaled the cliff, And plunging in the river's full-swoln stream, Stemm'd with broad breast its current; so his form, Sinewy and firm, and fit for deeds of arms, Tower'd above the throng effeminate. No dainty bath had from his hardy limbs Effaced the hauberk's honourable marks; His helmet bore of hostile steel the dints Many and deep; upon his pictured shield A Lion vainly struggled in the toils, Whilst by his side the cub with pious rage, Assail'd the huntsman. Tremouille followed them, Proud of the favour of a Prince who seem'd Given up to vain delights; conspicuous he In arms with azure and with gold anneal'd, Gaudily graceful, by no hostile blade Defaced, nor e'er with hostile blood distain'd; Trimly accoutred court-habiliments, Gay lady-dazzling armour, fit to adorn Tourney, or tilt, the gorgeous pageantry Of mimic warfare. After him there came A train of courtiers, summer flies that sport In the sunbeam of favour, insects sprung From the court dunghill, greedy blood-suckers, The foul corruption-gender'd swarm of state. As o'er some flowery field the busy bees Fill with their happy hum the fragrant air, A grateful music to the traveller, Who in the shade of some wide-spreading tree Rests on his way awhile; or like the sound Of many waters down some far-off steep Holding their endless course, the murmur rose Of admiration. Every gazing eye Dwelt on the Prophetess; of all beside, The long procession and the gorgeous train, Though glittering they with gold and sparkling gems. And their rich plumes high waving to the air, Heedless. The consecrated dome they reach, Rear'd to St. Katharine's holy memory Her tale the altar told; how Maximin, His raised lip kindled with a savage smile, In such deep fury bade the tenter'd wheel Rend her life piecemeal, that the very face Of the hard executioner relax'd With pity; calm she heard, no drop of blood Forsook her cheek, her steady eye was turn'd Heaven-ward, and hope and meekest piety Beam'd in that patient look. Nor vain her trust, For lo! the Angel of the Lord descends And crumbles with his fiery touch the wheel! One glance of holy triumph Katharine cast, Then bow'd her to the sword of martyrdom. Her eye averting from the pictured tale, The delegated damsel knelt and pour'd To Heaven her earnest prayer. A trophied tomb Stood near the altar where some warrior slept The sleep of death beneath. A massy stone And rude-ensculptured effigy o'erlaid The sepulchre. In silent wonderment The expectant multitude with eager eye Gaze, listening as the mattock's heavy stroke Invades the tomb's repose: the heavy stroke Sounds hollow; over the high-vaulted roof Roll the repeated echoes: soon the day Dawns on the grave's long night, the slant sunbeam Falls on the arms inshrined, the crested helm, The bauldrick, and the shield, and sacred sword. A sound of awe-repress'd astonishment Rose from the crowd. The delegated Maid Over her robes the hallowed breast-plate threw, Self-fitted to her form; on her helm'd head The white plumes nod, majestically slow; She lifts the buckler and the sacred sword, Gleaming portentous light. The wondering crowd Raise their loud shout of transport. “God of Heaven,” The Maid exclaim'd, “Father all merciful! Devoted to whose holy will, I wield The sword of vengeance; go before our host! All-just avenger of the innocent, Be thou our Champion! God of Peace, preserve Those whom no lust of glory leads to arms.” She ceased, and with an eager hush the crowd Still listen'd; a brief while throughout the dome Deep silence dwelt; then with a sudden burst Devout and full, they raised the choral hymn, “Thee Lord we praise, our God!” the throng without Catch the strange tidings, join the hymn of joy, And thundering transport peals along the heaven. As through the parting crowd the Virgin pass'd, He who from Orleans on the yesternight Demanded succour, clasp'd with warmth her hand, And with a bosom-thrilling voice exclaim'd, “Ill-omen'd Maid! victim of thine own worth, Devoted for this king-curst realm of France, Ill-omen'd Maid, I pity thee!” so saying, He turn'd into the crowd. At his strange words Disturb'd, the warlike Virgin pass'd along, And much revolving in her troubled mind, Retrod the court. And now the horn announced The ready banquet; they partook the feast, Then rose and in the cooling water cleansed Their hands, and seated at the board again Enjoy'd the bowl, or scented high with spice, Or flavour'd with the fragrant summer fruit, Or luscious with metheglin mingled rich. Meantime the Trouveur struck the harp; he sung Of Lancelot du Lake, the truest Knight That ever loved fair Lady; and the youth Of Cornwall underneath whose maiden sword The strength of Ireland fell; and he who struck The dolorous stroke, the blameless and the brave, Who died beneath a brother's erring arm. Ye have not perish'd, Chiefs of Carduel! The songs of earlier years embalm your fame; And haply yet some Poet shall arise, Like that divinest Tuscan, and enwreathe The immortal garland for himself and you. The harp still rung beneath the high-arch'd roof, And listening eager to the favourite lay, The guests sat silent, when into the hall The Messenger from that besieged town, Re-enter'd. “It is pleasant, King of France,” Said he, “to sit and hear the harper's song; Far other music hear the men of Orleans! Famine is there; and there the imploring cry Of Hunger ceases not.” “Insolent man!” Exclaim'd the Monarch, “cease to interrupt Our hour of festival; it is not thine To instruct me in my duty.” Of reproof Careless, the stranger to the minstrel cried, “Why harpest thou of good King Arthur's fame Amid these walls? Virtue and genius love That lofty lay. Hast thou no loose lewd tale To pamper and provoke the appetite? Such should procure thee worthy recompence! Or rather sing thou of that wealthy Lord, Who took the ewe lamb from the poor man's bosom, That was to him even as a daughter! Charles, This parable would I tell, prophet-like, And look at thee and say, ‘Thou art the man!’” He said, and with a quick and troubled step Withdrew. Astonish'd at his daring guise, The guests sat heedless of the lay awhile, Pondering his words mysterious, till at length The Court dispersed. Retiring from the hall, Charles and the delegated damsel sought The inner palace. There the gentle Queen Awaited them: with her Joan lov'd to pass Her intervals of rest; for she had won The Virgin's heart by her mild melancholy, The calm and duteous patience that deplored A husband's cold half-love. To her she told With what strange words the messenger from Orleans Had roused uneasy wonder in her mind; For on her ear yet vibrated his voice, When lo! again he came, and at the door Stood scowling round. “Why dost thou haunt me thus,” The monarch cried, “Is there no place secure From thy rude insolence? unmanner'd man! I know thee not!” “Then learn to know me, Charles!” Solemnly he replied; “read well my face, That thou may'st know it on that dreadful day, When at the Throne of God I shall demand His justice on thee!” Turning from the King, To Agnes as she enter'd, in a tone More low, more mournfully severe, he cried, Dost thou too know me not!” She glanced on him, And pale and breathless hid her head convulsed In the Maid's bosom. “King of France!” he said, “She loved me, and by mutual word and will We were betroth'd, when, in unhappy hour, I left her, as in fealty bound, to fight Thy battles. In mine absence thou didst come To tempt her then unspotted purity... For pure she was; . . Alas! these courtly robes Hide not the indelible stain of infamy! Thou canst not with thy golden belt put on An honourable name, O lost to me, And to thyself, for ever, ever lost, My poor polluted Agnes! . . Charles, that faith Almost is shaken, which should be henceforth My only hope: thou hast thy wicked will, While I the victim of her guilt and thine. Though meriting alike from her and thee Far other guerdon, bear about with me A wound for which this earth affords no balm, And doubt Heaven's justice.” So he said, and frown'd Austere as he who at Mahommed's door Knock'd loud and frequent, at whose dreadful mien Stricken with terror, all beholders fled. Even the prophet almost terrified, Scarcely could bear his presence; for he knew That this was the Death-Angel Azrael, And that his hour was come. Conscious of guilt The Monarch sate, nor could endure to face His bosom-probing frown. The Maid of Arc Meantime had read his features, and she cried “I know thee, Conrade!” Rising from her seat, She took his hand, for he stood motionless, Gazing on Agnes now with steady eye, Severe though calm: him from the Court she drew, And to the river side resisting not, Both sad and silent, led; till at the last As from a dream awaking, Conrade look'd Full on the Maid, and falling on her neck, He wept. “I know thee, Damsel!” he exclaim'd, “Dost thou remember that tempestuous night, When I, a weather-beaten traveller, sought Your hospitable door? ah me! I then Was happy! you too sojourn'd then in peace. Fool that I was! I blamed such happiness, Arraign'd it as a guilty selfish sloth, Unhappily prevailing, so I fear me, Or why art thou at Chinon?” Him the Maid Answering, address'd, “I do remember well, That night; for then the holy Spirit first, Waked by thy words, possess'd me.” Conrade cried, “Poor Maiden, thou wert happy! thou hadst lived Blessing and blest, if I had never stray'd, Needlessly rigid from my peaceful path. And thou hast left thine home then, and obey'd The feverish fancies of an ardent brain! And hast thou left him too, the youth whose eye For ever glancing on thee, spake so well Affection's eloquent tale?” So as he said, Rush'd the warm purple to the Virgin's cheek. “I am alone,” she answered, “for this realm Devoted.” Nor to answer more the Maid Endured, for many a melancholy thought Throng'd on her aching memory. Her mind's eye Beheld Domremi and the fields of Arc: Her burthen'd heart was full; such grief she felt Yet such sweet solacing of self-applause As cheers a banish'd Patriot's lonely hours When Fancy pictures to him all he loved, Till the big tear-drop rushes o'er its orb, And drowns the soft enchantment. With a look That spake solicitous wonder, Conrade eyed The silent Maid; nor would the Maid repress The thoughts that swell'd within her, or from him Hide her soul's workings. “'Twas on the last day Before I left Domremi; eve had closed, I sate beside the brook, my soul was full, As if inebriate with Divinity. Then Conrade! I beheld a ruffian herd Circle a flaming pile, where at the stake A woman stood; the iron bruised her breast, And round her limbs half-garmented, the fire Curl'd its fierce flakes. I saw her countenance, I knew myself.” Then, in a tone subdued Of calmness, “There are moments when the soul From her own impulse with strange dread recoils, Suspicious of herself; but with a full And perfect faith I know this vision sent From Heaven, and feel of its unerring truth, As that God liveth, that I live myself, The feeling that deceives not.” By the hand Her Conrade held and cried, “Ill-fated Maid, That I have torn thee from affection's breast, My soul will groan in anguish. Thou wilt serve Like me, the worthless Court, and having served, In the hour of ill abandon'd, thou wilt curse The duty that deluded. Of the world Fatigued, and loathing at my fellow-men, I shall be seen no more. There is a path... The eagle hath not mark'd it, the young wolf Knows not its hidden windings: I have trod That path, and found a melancholy den, Fit place for penitence and hopeless woe, Where sepulchred, the ghost of what he was, Conrade may pass his few and evil days, Waiting the wish'd-for summons to lay down His weary load of life.” But then the Maid Fix'd on the warrior her reproving eye; “I pass'd the fertile Auxerrois,” she said, “The vines had spread their interwoven shoots Over the unpruned vineyards, and the grape Rotted beneath the leaves; for there was none To tread the vintage, and the birds of Heaven Had had their fill. I saw the cattle start As they did hear the loud alarum bell, And with a piteous moaning vainly seek To fly the coming slaughterers. I look'd back Upon the cottage where I had partaken The peasant's meal, . . and saw it wrapt in flames. And then I thank'd my God that I had burst The ties, strong as they are, which bind us down To selfish happiness, and on this earth Was as a pilgrim... Conrade! rouse thyself! Cast the weak nature off! A time like this Is not for gentler feelings, for the glow Of love, the overflowings of the heart. There is oppression in thy country, Conrade! There is a cause, a holy cause, that needs The brave man's aid. Live for it, and enjoy Earth's noblest recompense, thine own esteem; Or die in that good cause, and thy reward Shall sure be found in Heaven.” He answer'd not, But pressing to his heart the virgin's hand, Hasten'd across the plain. She with dim eyes, For gushing tears obscured them, follow'd him Till lost in distance. With a weight of thought Opprest, along the poplar-planted Vienne Awhile she wander'd, then upon the bank She laid her down, and watch'd the tranquil stream Flow with a quiet murmuring, by the clouds Of evening purpled. The perpetual flow, The ceaseless murmuring, lull'd her to such dreams As memory in her melancholy mood Loves best. The wonted scenes of Arc arose; She saw the forest brook, the weed that waved Its long green tresses in the stream, the crag Which overbrow'd the spring, and that old yew Which through the bare and rifted rock had forced Its twisted trunk, the berries cheerful red Starring its gloomy green. Her pleasant home She saw, and those who made that home so dear, Her lov'd lost friends. The mingled feelings fill'd Her eyes, when from behind a voice was heard, “O Lady! canst thou tell me where to find The Maid whom Heaven hath sent to rescue France?” Thrill'd by the well-known tones, she started up, And fell upon the neck of Theodore. “Have I then found thee!’ cried the impassioned youth; “Henceforth we part no more; but where thou goest Thither go I. Beloved! in the front Of battle thou shalt find me at thy side; And in the breach this breast shall be thy shield And rampart. Oh, ungenerous! Why from me Conceal the inspiration? why from me Hide thy miraculous purpose? Am I then So all-unworthy that thou shouldst set forth Beneath another's guidance?” Thus he cried, Mingling reproach with tenderness, yet still Clasping in warm embrace the maid beloved. She of her bidding and futurity A while forgetful, patient of the embrace, With silent tears of joy bedew'd his neck. At length, “I hope,” she cried, “thou art not come With heavier fault and breach of nearer tie! How did thy mother spare thee, . . thou alone The stay and comfort of her widowed age? Did she upon thy parting steps bestow Her free-will blessing, or hast thou set forth, Which Heaven forbid, unlicensed, and unblest?” “Oh, surely not unblest!” the youth replied; Yet conscious of his unrepented fault, With countenance flush'd, and faltering in reply: “She wept at my departure, she would fain Have turn'd me from my purpose, and my heart Perhaps had fail'd me, if it had not glow'd With ardour like thine own; the sacred fire With which thy bosom burns had kindled me; High in prophetic hope, I bade her place Her trust in Heaven; I bade her look to hear Good tidings soon of glorious victory; I told her I should soon return, . . return With thee, and thou wouldst be to her old age What Madelon had been.” As thus he spake, Warm with the imaginary bliss, he clasp'd The dear one closer to his yearning heart. But the devoted Virgin in his arms Started and shudder'd, for the flaming pile Flash'd on remembrance now, and on her soul The whole terrific vision rose again. A death-like paleness at the dreadful thought Wither'd her cheek; cold damps suffused her brow, And falling on the neck of Theodore, Feeble and faint she hung. His eager eye Concentring all the anguish of the soul, And strain'd in anxious love, gazed fearfully With wondering anguish; till ennobling thoughts Of her high mission roused her, and her soul Collected, and she spake. “My Theodore, Thou hast done ill to quit thy mother's home! Alone and aged she will weep for thee, Wasting her little that is left of life In anguish. Now go back again to Arc, And cheer her wintry hours of widowhood, And love my memory there.” Swift he exclaim'd, “Nay, Maid! the pang of parting is o'erpast, And my dear mother looks for the glad hour When we shall both return. Amid the war How many an arm will seek thy single life, How many a sword and spear... I will go with thee And spread the guardian shield!” “Nay,” she replied. “I shall not need thy succour in the war. Me, Heaven, if so seem good to its high will, Will save. I shall be happier, Theodore, Thinking that thou dost sojourn safe at home, And make thy mother happy.” The youth's cheek A rapid blush disorder'd. “Oh! the court Is pleasant then, and thou wouldst fain forget A humble villager, who only boasts The treasure of the heart!” She look'd at him With a reproaching eye of tenderness: “Injurious man! devoted for this realm, I go a willing victim. The dark veil Hath been withrawn for me, and I have seen The fearful features of Futurity. Yes, Theodore, I shall redeem my country, A bandoning for it the joys of life, Yea, life itself!” Then on his neck she fell, And with a faultering voice, “Return to Arc! I do not tell thee there are other maids As fair; for thou wilt love my memory, Hallowing to me the temple of thy heart. Worthy a happier, not a better love, My Theodore!”—Then, pressing his pale lips, A last and holy kiss the virgin fix'd, And fled across the plain. She reach'd the court Breathless. The mingled movements of her mind Shook every fibre. Sad and sick at heart, Fain to her lonely chamber's solitude The Maiden had retired; but her the King Met on the threshold. He of the late scene Forgetful and his crime, as cheerful seem'd As though there had not been a God in Heaven! “Enter the hall,” he said, “the masquers there Join in the dance. Why, Maiden, art thou sad? Has that rude madman shook thy gentle frame With his strange speeches?” Ere the Maid replied, The Son of Orleans came with joyful speed, Poising his massy javelin. “Thou hast roused The sleeping virtue of the sons of France, They crowd around the standard,” cried the chief. “Our brethern pent in Orleans, every moment Gaze from the watch-tower with the sickening eye Of expectation.” Then the King exclaim'd, “O chosen by Heaven! defer one day thy march, That humbled at the altar we may join The general prayer. Be these our holy rites To-morrow's task;—to night for merriment!” The Maid replied, “The wretched ones in Orleans, In fear and hunger and expiring hope, A wait my succour, and my prayers would plead In Heaven against me, did they waste one hour When active duty calls. For this night's mirth Hold me excused; in truth I am not fit For merriment; a heavy charge is on me, And I must put away all mortal thoughts.” Her heart was full, and pausing, she repress'd The unbidden anguish. “Lo! they crowd around The standard! Thou, Dunois, the chosen troops Marshal in speed, for early with the dawn We march to rescue Orleans from the foe.” THE FIFTH BOOK. Scarce had the early dawn from Chinon's towers Made visible the mist that curl'd along The river's winding way, when from her couch The martial Maid arose. She mail'd her limbs; The white plumes nodded o'er her helmed head; She girt the sacred falchion by her side, And, like a youth who from his mother's arms, For his first field impatient, breaks away, Poising the lance went forth. Twelve hundred men, Rearing in order'd ranks their glittering spears, Await her coming. Terrible in arms Before them tower'd Dunois, his manly face O'er-shadow'd by the helmet's iron cheeks. The assembled court gazed on the marshall'd train, And at the gate the aged prelate stood To pour his blessing on the chosen host. And now a soft and solemn symphony Was heard, and chaunting high the hallow'd hymn, From the near convent came the vestal maids. A holy banner, woven by virgin hands, Snow-white they bore. A mingled sentiment Of awe and eager ardor for the fight, Thrill'd through the army, as the reverend man Took the white standard, and with heaven-ward eye Call'd on the God of Justice, blessing it. The Maid, her brows in reverence unhelm'd, Her dark hair floating on the morning gale, Knelt to his prayer, and stretching forth her hand Received the mystic banner. From the host A loud and universal shout burst forth, As rising from the ground, upon her brow She placed the plumed casque, and waved on high The banner'd lilies. On their way they march, And dim in distance, soon the towers of Chinon Fade from the eye reverted. The sixth sun, Purpling the sky with his dilated light, Sunk westering; when embosom'd in the depth Of that old forest, which for many a league Shadow'd the hills and vales of Orleannois, They pitch their tents. The hum of occupation Sounds ceaseless. Waving to the evening gale The streamers flutter; and ascending slow Beneath the foliage of the forest trees, With many a light hue tinged, the curling smoke Melts in the impurpled air. Leaving her tent, The martial Maiden wander'd through the wood; There, by a streamlet, on the mossy bank Reclined, she saw a damsel, her long locks With willow wreathed; upon her lap there lay A dark-hair'd man, listening the while she sung Sad ditties, and enwreathed to bind his brow The melancholy garland. At the sound, Of one in arms approaching, she had fled; But Conrade, looking upward, recognized The Maid of Arc. “Nay, fear not, Isabel,” Said he, “for this is one of gentle kind, Whom even the wretched need not fear to love.” So saying, he arose and took her hand, And press'd it to his bosom. “My weak heart, Though school'd by wrongs to loath at human kind, Will beat, rebellious to its own resolves. Come hither, outcast one! and call her friend, And she will be thy friend more readily Because thou art unhappy.” Isabel Saw a tear starting in the virgin's eye, And glancing upon Conrade, she too wept, Wailing his wilder'd senses. “Mission'd Maid!” The warrior cried, “be happy! for thy power Can make this sufferer so. From Orleans driven, Orphan'd by war, and of her only friend Bereft, I found her wandering in the wilds, Worn out with want and wretchedness. Thou, Joan, Wilt his beloved to the youth restore; And trust me, Maid! the miserable feel When they on others bestow happiness, Their happiest consolation.” She replied, Pressing the damsel's hand, in the mild tone Of equal friendship, solacing her cares. “Soon shall we enter Orleans,” said the Maid; A few hours in her dream of victory England shall triumph, then to be awaked By the loud thunder of Almighty wrath! Irksome meantime the busy camp to me A solitary woman. Isabel, Wert thou the while companion of my tent, Lightlier the time would pass. Return with me; I may not long be absent.” So she spake. The wanderer in half-utter'd words express'd Grateful assent. “Art thou astonish'd, then, That one though powerful is benevolent? In truth thou well mayest wonder!” Conrade cried. But little cause to love the mighty ones Hath the low cottager; for with its shade Too oft doth Power, a death-dew-dropping tree, Blast every herb beneath its baleful boughs! Tell thou thy sufferings, Isabel! Relate How warr'd the chieftains, and the people died. The mission'd Virgin hath not heard thy woes; And pleasant to mine ear the twice-told tale Of sorrow.” Gazing on the martial Maid She read her wish, and spake. “A wanderer now, Friendless and hopeless, still I love to think Upon my native home, and call to mind Each haunt of careless youth; the woodbined wall, The jessamine that round the straw-roof'd cot Its fragrant branches wreathed, beneath whose shade I wont to sit and watch the setting sun, And hear the thrushes song. Nor far remote, As o'er the subject landskip round I gazed, The towers of Yenville rose upon the view. A foreign master holds my father's home! I, far away, remember the past years, And weep. Two brethren form'd our family; Humble we were, and happy; honest toil Procured our homely sustenance; our herds Duly at morn and evening to my hand Gave their full stores; the vineyard we had rear'd Purpled its clusters in the southern sun, And, plenteous produce of my father's toil, The yellow harvest billow'd o'er the plain. How cheerfully around the blazing hearth When all the labour of the day was done, We past the evening hours; for they would sing Or merry roundelay, or ditty sad Of maid forsaken and the willow weed, Or of the doughty Paladins of France Some warlike fit, the while my spinning wheel A fitting music made. Thus long we lived, And happy. To a neighbouring youth my hand In holy wedlock soon to be consign'd Was plighted: my poor Francis!” Here she paused, And here she wept awhile. “We did not think The desolating stream of war would reach To us; but soon as with the whirlwind's speed Ruin rush'd round us. Mehun, Clery, fell, The banner'd Leopard waved on Gergeau's wall; Baugenci yielded; soon the foe approach'd The towers of Yenville. Fatal was the hour To me and mine: for from the wall, alas! The rusty sword was taken, and the shield Which long had moulder'd on the mouldering nail, To meet the war repair'd. No more was heard The ballad, or the merry roundelay; The clattering hammer's clank, the grating file Harsh sounded through the day a dismal din; I never shall forget their mournful sound! “My father stood encircling his old limbs In long-forgotten arms. ‘Come, boys,’ he cried, I did not think that this grey head again Should bear the helmet's weight; but in the field Better to bravely die a soldier's death, Than here be tamely butcher'd. Isabel, Go to the abbey! if we should survive, We soon shall meet again; if not, my child, There is a better world! In broken words, Lifting his eyes to Heaven, my father breathed His blessing on me. As they went away, My brethren gazed on me and wrung my hand In silence, for they loved their sister well. From the near cottage Francis join'd the troop. Then did I look on our forsaken home, And almost sob my very soul away; For all my hopes of happiness were fled, Even like a dream!” “Perish these mighty ones, Cried Conrade, “these who let destruction loose, Who walk elated o'er their fields of fame, And count the thousands that lie slaughter'd there, And with the bodies of the innocent, rear Their pyramid of glory! perish these, The epitome of all the pestilent plagues That Egypt knew! who send their locust swarms O'er ravaged realms, and bid the brooks run blood. Fear and Destruction go before their path, And Famine dogs their footsteps. God of Justice, Let not the innocent blood cry out in vain!” Thus while he spake, the murmur of the camp Rose on their ear; first like the distant sound When the full-foliaged forest to the storm Shakes its hoarse head; anon with louder din; And through the opening glade gleam'd many a fire. The Virgin's tent they enter'd; there the board Was spread, the wanderer of the fare partook, Then thus her tale renew'd:— “Slow o'er the hill Whose rising head conceal'd our cot I past, Yet on my journey paused awhile, and gazed And wept; for often had I crost the hill With cheerful step, and seen the rising smoke Of hospitable fire; alas! no smoke Curl'd o'er its melancholy chimneys now! Orleans I reach'd. There in the suburbs stood The abbey; and ere long I learnt the fall Of Yenville. On a day, a soldier ask'd For Isabel. Scarce could my faltering feet Support me. It was Francis, and alone... The sole survivor of that company! “And soon the foes approach'd: impending war Soon sadden'd Orleans. There the bravest chiefs Assemble: Thouars, Coarase, Chabannes, And the Sire Chapelle, in successful war Since wounded to the death; and that good Knight Giresme of Rhodes, who in a better cause Can never wield the crucifix that hilts His hallowed sword; and Xaintrailles ransom'd now, And Fayette late released, and that young Duke Who at Verneuil senseless with many a wound Fell prisoner, and La Hire, the merriest man That ever yet did win his soldiers' love, And over all for hardihood renown'd The Bastard Orleans. These within the town Expect the foe. Twelve hundred chosen men Well tried in war, uprear the guardian shield Beneath their banners. Dreadful was the sight Of preparation. The wide suburbs stretch'd Along the pleasant borders of the Loire, Late throng'd with multitudes, now feel the hand Of ruin. These preventive care destroys, Lest England, shelter'd by the friendly walls, Securely should approach. The monasteries Fell in the general waste. The holy monks Unwillingly their long-accustom'd haunts Abandon, haunts where every gloomy nook Call'd to awaken'd memory some trace Of vision seen, or sound miraculous. Trembling and terrified, their noiseless cells, For the rude uproar of a world unknown, The nuns desert: their abbess, more composed, Collects her maids around, and tells her beads, And pours the timid prayer of piety. The pioneers, by day and night employ'd, Throw up the violated earth, to impede The foe: the hollow chambers of the dead Echo'd beneath their stroke. The brazen tomb Which late recorded death, in the furnace cast Is made to inflict it now. Sad sight it was To see so wide a waste; the aged ones Hanging their heads, and weeping as they went O'er the fallen dwellings of their happier years; The stern and sullen silence of the men Musing on vengeance: and but ill represt, The mother's fears as to her breast she clasp'd, Her ill-doom'd infant. Soon the suburbs lay One ample ruin; whence the stones were borne Within the town to serve in its defence. “And now without the walls the desolate space Appear'd, a rough and melancholy waste, With uptorn pavements and foundations deep Of many a ruin'd dwelling. Nor within Less dreary was the scene; at evening hour No more the merry viol's note was heard; No more the aged matron at her door Humm'd cheery to her spinning wheel, and saw Her children dancing to the roundelay. The chieftains strengthening still the ancient walls, Survey them every where with prying eye; The eager youth in anxious preparation Practise the arts of war; silent and stern, With the hurrying restlessness of fear, they urge Their gloomy labours. In the city dwelt An utter silence of all pleasant sounds, But all day long the armourer's beat was heard, And all night long it echoed. Soon the foe Led to our walls the siege: as on they move The clarions clangor, and the cheerful fife, Accordant to the thundering drum's deep sound, Direct their measured march. Before the ranks Salisbury was seen, Salisbury, so long the scourge Of France; and Talbot towered by his side, Talbot, at whose dread name the froward child Clings mute and trembling to his nurse's breast. Suffolk was there, and Hungerford, and Scales, And Fastolffe, victor in the frequent fight. Dark as the autumnal storm they roll'd along, A countless host! From the high tower I mark'd The dreadful scene; I saw the iron gleam Of javelins sparkling to the noontide sun, Their banners tossing to the troubled gale, And.. fearful music.. heard upon the wind The modulated step of multitudes. “There in the midst, shuddering with fear, I saw The dreadful stores of death; tremendous roll'd Over rough roads the harsh wheels; the brazen tubes Flash'd in the sun their fearful splendor far, And last the loaded waggons creak'd along. “Nor were our chieftains, whilst their care procured Human defence, neglectful to implore That heavenly aid, deprived of which the strength Of man is weakness. Bearing through our streets The precious relics of the holy dead, The monks and nuns pour'd many an earnest prayer, Devoutly join'd by all. Saint Aignan's shrine Was throng'd by supplicants, the general voice Call'd on Saint Aignan's name again to save His people, as of yore, before he past Into the fulness of eternal rest; When by the Spirit to the lingering camp Of Ætius borne, he brought the timely aid, And Attila with all his multitudes Far off retreated to their field of shame.” And now Dunois, for he had seen the camp Well-order'd, enter'd. “One night more in peace England shall rest,” he cried, “ere yet the storm Burst on her guilty head! then their proud vaunts Forgotten, or remember'd to their shame, Vainly her chiefs shall curse the hour when first They pitch'd their tents round Orleans.” “Of that siege,” The Maid of Arc replied, “gladly I hear The detail. Isabel proceed! for soon Destined to rescue this devoted town, The tale of all the ills she hath endured I listen, sorrowing for the past, and feel Joy and contentment in the merciful task For which I am sent forth.” Thus spake the Maid, And Isabel pursued. “And now more near The hostile host advancing pitch their tents. Unnumber'd streamers wave, and clamorous shouts, Anticipating conquest, rend the air With universal uproar. From their camp A herald came; his garb emblazon'd o'er With leopards and the lilies of our realm, Foul shame to France! The summons of the foe He brought.” The Bastard interrupting cried, “I was with Gaucour and the assembled chiefs, When by his office privileged and proud That herald spake, as certain of success As he had made a league with Victory. “Nobles of France rebellious! from the chief Of yon victorious host, the mighty Earl Of Salisbury, now there in place of him Your Regent John of Bedford: in his name I come, and in our sovereign Lord the King's, Henry. Ye know full well our master's claim, Incontrovertible to this good realm, By right descent, and solemnly confirm'd By your great monarch and our mighty king Fifth Henry, in the treaty ratified At Troyes, wherein your monarch did disclaim All future right and title to this crown, His own exempted, for his son and heirs Down to the end of time. This sign'd and seal'd At the holy altar, and by nuptial knot Of Henry and your princess, gives the realm, Charles dead and Henry, to his infant son Henry of Windsor. Who then dares oppose My Master's title, in the face of God, Of wilful perjury, most atrocious crime, Stands guilty, and of flat rebellion 'gainst The Lord's anointed. He at Paris crown'd With loud acclaim of duteous multitudes, Thus speaks by me. Deliver up your town To Salisbury, and yield yourselves and arms, So shall your lives be safe: and such his grace, If of your free accord to him you pay Due homage as your sovereign lord and King, Your rich estates, your houses shall be safe, And you in favour stand, as is the Duke, Philip of Burgundy. But.. mark me well! If obstinately wilful, you persist To scorn his proffer'd mercy, not one stone Upon another of this wretched town Shall then be left; and when the English host Triumphant in the dust have trod the towers Of Orleans, who survive the dreadful war Shall die like traitors by the hangman's hand. Ye men of France, remember Caen and Roan!” “He ceased: nor Gaucour for a moment paused To form reply. ‘Herald! to all thy vaunts Of English sovereignty let this suffice For answer: France will only own as King Her own legitimate Lord. On Charles's brow, Transmitted through a long and good descent, The crown remains. We know no homage due To English robbers, and disclaim the peace Inglorious made at Troyes by factious men Hostile to France. Thy master's proffer'd grace Meets the contempt it merits. Herald, yes, Be sure we shall remember Caen and Roan! Go tell the mighty Earl of Salisbury, That as like Blanchard, Gaucour dares his power, Like Blanchard, he can brave his cruelty, And triumph by enduring. Speak I well, Ye men of Orleans?’ “Never did I hear A shout so universal as ensued Of approbation. The assembled host As with one voice pour'd forth their loyalty, And struck their sounding shields; and walls and towers, Echoed the loud uproar. The herald went. The work of war began. A fearful scene,” Cried Isabel. “The iron storm of death Clash'd in the sky; the mighty engines hurl'd Huge stones which shook the ground where'er they fell. Then was there heard at once the clang of arms, The thundering cannons, and the soldier's shout, The female's shriek, the affrighted infant's cry, The groan of death, . . discord of dreadful sounds That jarr'd the soul. Nor while the encircling foe Leager'd the walls of Orleans, idly slept Our friends: for winning down the Loire its way The frequent vessel with provision fraught, And men, and all the artillery of death, Cheer'd us with welcome succour. At the bridge These safely landed mock'd the foeman's force. This to prevent, Salisbury, their watchful chief, A mighty work prepares. Around our walls, Encircling walls he builds, surrounding thus The city. Firm'd with massiest buttresses, At equal distance, sixty forts protect The English lines. But chief where in the town The six great avenues meet in the midst, Six castles there he rear'd impregnable, With deep-dug moats and bridges drawn aloft, Where over the strong gate suspended hung The dread portcullis. Thence the gunner's eye From his safe shelter could with ease survey Intended sally, or approaching aid, And point destruction. It were long to tell And tedious, how in many a bold assault The men of Orleans sallied on their foes; How after difficult fight the enemy Possess'd the Tournelles, and the embattled tower That shadows from the bridge the subject Loire; Though numbering now three thousand daring men, Frequent and fierce the garrison repell'd Their far out-numbering foes. From every aid Included, they in Orleans groan'd beneath All ills accumulate. The shatter'd roofs Allow'd the dews of night free passage there; And ever and anon the ponderous stone, Ruining where'er it fell, with hideous crash Came like an earthquake, startling from his sleep The affrighted soldier. From the brazen slings The wild-fire balls hiss'd through the midnight sky; And often their huge engines cast among us The dead and loathsome cattle of their camp, As though our enemies, to their deadly league Forcing the common air, would make us breathe Poisonous pollution. Through the streets were seen, The frequent fire, and heaps of dead, in haste Piled up and steaming to infected Heaven. For ever the incessant storm of death Pours down, and crowded in unwholesome vaults The wretched females hide, not idle there, Wasting the hours in tears, but all employ'd, Or to provide the hungry soldier's meal, Or tear their garments to bind up his wounds: A sad equality of wretchedness! “Now came the worst of ills, for Famine came: The provident hand deals out its scanty dole, Yielding so little a supply to life As but protracted death. The loathliest food Hunted with eager eye and dainty deem'd, The dog is slain, that at his master's feet Howling with hunger lay; with jealous fear, Hating a rival's look, the husband hides His miserable meal; the famish'd babe Clings closely to his dying mother's breast; And.. horrible to tell! . . where, thrown aside, There lay unburied in the open streets Huge heaps of carcasses, the soldier stands Eager to mark the carrion crow for food. “O peaceful scenes of childhood! pleasant fields! Haunts of mine infancy, where I have stray'd Tracing the brook along its winding way, Or pluck'd the primrose, or with giddy speed Chaced the gay butterfly from flower to flower! O days in vain remember'd! how my soul, Sick with calamity, and the sore ills Of hunger, dwelt on you and on my home! Thinking of you amid the waste of war, I could in bitterness have cursed the great Who made me what I was, a helpless one, Orphan'd, and wanting bread!” “And be they curst!” Conrade exclaim'd, his dark eye flashing rage; “And be they curst! O groves and woodland shades, How blest indeed were you, if the iron rod Should one day from Oppression's hand be wrench'd By everlasting Justice! Come that hour, When in the Sun the Angel of the Lord Shall stand and cry to all the fowls of Heaven, ‘Gather ye to the supper of your God, That ye may eat the flesh of mighty men, Of captains, and of kings!’ Then shall be peace.” “And now, lest all should perish,” she pursued, The women and the infirm must from the town Go forth and seek their fate. I will not now Recall the moment, when on my poor Francis With a long look I hung. At dead of night, Made mute by fear, we mount the secret bark, And glide adown the stream with silent oars: Thus thrown upon the mercy of mankind, I wandered reckless where, till wearied out, And cold at heart, I laid me down to die; So by this warrior found. Him I had known And loved, for all loved Conrade who had known him; Nor did I feel so pressing the hard hand Of want in Orleans, ere he parted thence On perilous envoy. For of his small fare”— “Of this enough,” said Conrade; “Holy Maid! One duty yet awaits me to perform. Orleans her envoy sent me, to demand Aid from her idle sovereign. Willingly Did I achieve the hazardous enterprize, For rumour had already made me fear The ill that hath fallen on me. It remains, Ere I do banish me from human kind, That I re-enter Orleans, and announce Thy march. 'Tis night, and hark! how dead a silence! Fit hour to tread so perilous a path!” So saying, Conrade from the tent went forth. THE SIXTH BOOK. The night was calm, and many a moving cloud Shadow'd the moon. Along the forest glade With swift foot Conrade past, and now had reach'd The plain, where whilome by the pleasant Loire, Cheer'd with the song, the rustics had beheld The day go down upon their merriment: No song of peace now echoed on its banks. There tents were pitch'd, and there the sentinel, Slow pacing on his sullen rounds, beheld The frequent corse roll down the tainted stream. Conrade with wider sweep pursued his way, Shunning the camp, now hush'd in sleep and still. And now no sound was heard save of the Loire, Murmuring along. The noise of coming feet Alarm'd him; nearer drew the rapid steps As of pursuit; anon.. the clash of arms! That instant breaking through a rifted cloud The moonlight show'd, where two with force combined Prest on a single foe, who, warding still Their swords, retreated in unequal fight, As he would make the city. Hastening With timely help to save him, Conrade sped. One with an unexpected stroke he slew; The other fled: “Now let us speed our best, Frenchman!” he cried. On to the Loire they ran, And making way with practised arms across, Ere long in safety gain'd the opposite shore. “Whence art thou?” cried the warrior; “and on what Commission'd!” “Is it not the voice of Conrade?” Francis replied; “and dost thou bring to us Tidings of succour? oh! that it had come A few hours earlier! Isabel is gone!” “Nay she is safe,” cried Conrade; “her I found Bewilder'd in the forest, and consign'd her To the protection of the holy Maid, Whom Heaven hath sent to rescue us. Now say Wherefore alone? A fugitive from Orleans, Or sent on dangerous service from the town!” “There is no food in Orleans,” he replied, “Scarce a meal more. The assembled chiefs resolve, If thou shouldst bring no tidings of near aid, To cut their way to safety, or by death Prevent the pang of famine. One they sought Who venturing to the English lines should spy Where best to venture on this desperate chance; And I believing all I loved was lost Offer'd myself.” So saying, they approach'd The gate. The sentinel, soon as he heard Thitherward footsteps, with uplifted lance Challenged the darkling travellers. At their voice He drew the strong bolts back, and cautiously Open'd the wicket. To the careful chiefs Who sate in midnight council, they were led, And Conrade thus address'd them: “Sirs, the Lord, In this our utmost need, hath sent us aid. A holy Maid hath been raised up by Heaven; Her mission is by miracles confirm'd, And hither with twelve hundred chosen men, Led by Dunois, she comes. I am myself A witness to the truth of what I tell; And by to-morrow's noon, before these walls Her banner will be seen.” Thereat the chiefs Were fill'd with wonder and with joy, by doubt Little repress'd. “Open the granaries!” Xaintrailles exclaim'd; “give we to all the host “With hand unsparing now a plenteous meal; To-morrow we are safe! for Heaven all-just Hath seen our sufferings and decreed their end. Let the glad tidings echo through the town! God is with us!” “Be not too confident,” Graville replied, “in this miraculous aid. Some frantic woman this who gives belief To idle dreams, and with her madness then Infects the simple! That Dunois is there, Leading in arms twelve hundred chosen men, Affords a better hope; yet lavish not Our stores, lest in the enterprise he fail, And Orleans then be fain to bear the yoke Of England!” “Chief! I tell thee,” Conrade cried, “I did myself behold the sepulchre, Fulfilling what she spake, give up those arms Which surely for no common end the grave Through many an age hath held inviolate. She is the Prophetess of the Most High, And will deliver Orleans!” Gaucour then, “Be it as thou hast said. For I must think, That surely to no vulgar tale these chiefs Would yield a light belief; and our poor stores Must speedily, ye know, be clean consumed. Spread then the joyful tidings through the troops That God hath to deliver the oppress'd, As in old time, raised up a Prophetess, And the belief itself will make them fight With irresistible courage.” Thus the chief, And what he said seem'd good. The men of Orleans, Long by their foemen bay'd, such transport felt, As when the Mexicans, with eager eye Gazing to Huixachtla's distant top, On that last night, doubtful if ever morn Again shall cheer them, mark the mystic fire Flame on the breast of some brave prisoner, A dreadful altar. As they see the blaze Beaming on Iztapalapan's near towers, Or on Tezcuco's calmy lake flash'd far, Songs of thanksgiving and the shout of joy Wake the loud echo; the glad husband tears The mantling aloe from his consort's face, And children, now deliver'd from the dread Of everlasting darkness, look abroad, Hail the good omen, and expect the sun Uninjur'd still to run his flaming race. While thus in Orleans hope had banished sleep, The Maiden's host perform'd their evening prayer, And in the forest took their rest secure. And now the morning came. At earliest dawn Lightly upstarting and bedight in arms, The Bastard moved along, with provident eye Marshalling the troops. All high in hope they march; And now the sun shot from the southern sky His noontide radiance, when afar they hear The hum of men, and see the distant towers Of Orleans, and the bulwarks of the foe, And many a streamer wantoning in air. These as they saw and thought of all the ills Their brethren had endured, closely pent there For many a month, such ardor for the fight Burnt in each bosom, as young Ali felt Then when Mohammed of the assembled tribe Ask'd who would be his Vizir. Fierce in faith, Forth from the race of Hashem stept the youth, “Prophet of God! lo.. I will be the man!” And well did Ali merit that high post, Victorious upon Beder's fertile vale, And on mount Ohud, and before the walls Of Chaibar, when down-cleaving to the chest His giant foe, he grasp'd the massy gate, Shook with strong arm and tore it from the fort, And lifted it in air, portentous shield! “Behold the towers of Orleans,” cried Dunois. “Lo! this the vale where on the banks of Loire, Of yore, at close of day the rustic band Danced to the roundelay. In younger years As oft I glided down the silver stream, Frequent upon the lifted oar I paused, Listening the sound of far-off merriment. There wave the hostile banners! martial Maid, Give thou the signal! . . let us fall upon These merciless invaders, who have sack'd Village and town, and made the hamlet haunts Silent, or hearing but the widow's groan. Give but the signal, Maiden!” Her dark eye Fix'd sadly on the foe, the holy Maid Answer'd him; “Ere the avenging sword be drawn, And slaughter be let loose, befits us send Some peaceful messenger, who shall make known The will of Heaven: so timely warn'd, our foes Haply may yet repent, and quit in peace Besieged Orleans, for I fain would spare The bloody price of victory.” So she said; And as she spake, a soldier from the ranks Came forward. “I will be thy messenger, O Prophetess! and to the English camp Will bear thy bidding.” “Go,” the Virgin cried; “Say to the Lord of Salisbury, and the chiefs Of England, Suffolk, Fastolffe, Talbot, Scales, Invaders of the country, say, thus says The Maid of Orleans: ‘With your troops retire In peace. Of every captured town the keys Restore to Charles; so bloodless you may seek Your native island; for the God of Hosts Thus hath decreed. To Charles the rightful heir, By long descent and by the willing choice Of duteous subjects, hath the Lord assign'd The kingdom. In His name the Virgin comes Arm'd with the sword, yet not of mercy void. Depart in peace: for ere the morrow dawns, Victorious upon yonder wall shall wave Her holy banner.’” To the English camp Fearless the herald went. At mid-day meal, With all the dissonance of boisterous mirth, The British chiefs caroused and quaff'd the bowl, When by the sentinel conducted there The Maiden's herald came. “Chiefs,” he began, “Salisbury, and ye the representatives Of the English King, usurper of this realm, To ye the leaders of the English host I come, no welcome messenger. Thus saith The Maid of Orleans: ‘With your troops retire In peace. Of every captured town the keys Restore to Charles; so bloodless you may seek Your native island; for the God of Hosts Thus hath decreed. To Charles the rightful heir, By long descent and by the willing choice Of duteous subjects, hath the Lord assign'd The kingdom. In His name the Virgin comes, Arm'd with the sword, yet not of mercy void. Depart in peace: for ere the morrow dawns, Victorious upon yonder wall shall wave Her holy banner.’” Wonder made a pause; To this a laugh succeeds. “What!” Fastolffe cried, “A virgin warrior hath your monarch sent To save devoted Orleans? By the rood, I thank his grace. If she be young and fair, No worthless prize, my lords! Go, tell your Maid, Joyful we wait her coming.” There was one Among the English chiefs who had grown old In arms, yet had not age unnerved his limbs, But from the flexile nimbleness of youth To unyielding stiffness braced them. One who saw Him seated at the board, might well have deem'd That Talbot with his whole collected might Wielded the sword in war, for on his neck The veins were full, and every muscle bore The character of strength. He his stern eye Fix'd on the herald, and before he spake His silence threaten'd. “Get thee gone!” exclaim'd The indignant chief: “away! nor think to scare With girlish phantasies the English host That scorns your bravest warriors. Hie thee thence, And tell this girl she may expect to meet The mockery of the camp!” “Nay, scare her not,” Replied their chief: “go, tell this Maid of Orleans, That Salisbury longs to meet her in the fight. Nor let her fear that cords or iron chains Shall gall her tender limbs; for I myself Will be her prison, and—” “Contemptuous man! No more!” the Herald cried, as to his cheek Rush'd the red anger: “bearing words of peace And timely warning came I to your camp; And here have been with insolent ribaldry Received. Bear witness, chieftains! that the French, Free from blood-guiltiness, shall meet the war.” “And who art thou?” cried Suffolk, and his eye Grew fierce and wrath-inflamed: “What fool art thou, Who at this woman's bidding comest to brave The host of England? Thou shalt have thy meed!” Then turning to the sentinel he cried, “Prepare a stake! and let the men of Orleans, And let this woman who believes her name May privilege her herald, see the fire Consume him. Plant a stake! for by my God He shall be kalendered of this new faith First martyr.” As he spake, a sudden flush Came o'er the herald's cheek, and his heart beat With quicker action; but the sudden flush, Nature's instinctive impulse, faded soon To such a steady hue as spake the soul Roused up with all its powers, and unsubdued, And strengthen'd for endurance. Through the camp, Soon as the tidings spread, a shout arose, A hideous shout, more savage than the howl! Of midnight wolves, around him as they throng'd, To gaze upon their victim. He pass'd on; And as they led him to the appointed place Look'd round, as though forgetful of himself, And cried aloud, “Oh! woe it is to think So many men shall never see the sun Go down! Ye English mothers mourn ye now! Daughters of England weep! for hard of heart Still your mad leaders urge this impious war; And for their folly and their wickedness, Your sons, your husbands, by the sword must fall. Long-suffering is the Lord, and slow to wrath, But heavy are his judgements!” He who spake Was young and comely; had his cheek been pale With dread, and had his eye look'd fearfully, Sure he had won compassion; but the blood Gave now a livelier meaning to his cheek, As with a prophet's look and prophet's voice He raised his ominous warning: they who heard Wonder'd, and they who rear'd the stake perform'd With half-unwilling hands their slacken'd toil, And doubted what might follow. Not unseen Rear'd they the stake, and piled around the wood; In sight of Orleans and the Maiden's host, Had Suffolk's arrogant fierceness bade the work Of death be done. The Maiden's host beheld; At once in eager wrath they raised the loud And general clamour, “Lead us to the foe!” “Not upon us, O God!” the Maid exclaim'd, “Not upon us cry out the innocent blood!” And bade the signal sound. In the English camp The clarion and the trumpet's blare was heard; In haste they seize their arms, in haste they form, Some by bold words seeking to hide their fear Even from themselves, some silently in prayer, For much their hearts misgave them. But the rage Of Suffolk swell'd within him. “Speed your work!” Exclaim'd the injurious earl; “kindle the pile, That France may see the fire, and in defeat Feel aggravated shame!” And now they bound The herald to the stake: he cried aloud, And fix'd his eye on Suffolk, “Let not him Who girdeth on his harness boast himself As he that puts it off! They come; they come! God and the Maid!” The host of France approach'd, And Suffolk eagerly beheld the fire Brought near the pile; when suddenly a shout Toward Orleans call'd his eye, and thence he saw A man-at-arms upon a barded steed Come thundering on. As when Chederles comes To aid the Moslem on his deathless horse, Swaying the sword with such resistless arm, Such mightiest force, as he had newly quaff'd The hidden waters of eternal youth, Till with the copious draught of life and strength Inebriate; such, so fierce, so terrible, Came Conrade through the camp. Aright, aleft, The affrighted foemen scatter from his spear; Onward he comes, and now the circling throng Fly from the stake, and now he checks his course, And cuts the herald's bonds, and bids him live To arm, and fight, and conquer. “Haste thee hence To Orleans,” cried the warrior. “Tell the chiefs There is confusion in the English camp. Bid them come forth.” On Conrade's steed the youth Leapt up, and hasten'd onward. He the while Turn'd to the war. Like two conflicting clouds, Pregnant with thunder, moved the hostile hosts. Then man met man, then on the batter'd shield Rung the loud lance, and through the darken'd sky Fast fell the arrowy storm. Amid his foes The Bastard's arm dealt irresistibly The strokes of death; and by his side the Maid Led the fierce fight, the Maid, though all unused To such rude conflict, now inspired by Heaven, Flashing her flamy falchion through the troops, That like the thunderbolt, where'er it fell, Scatter'd the trembling ranks. The Saracen, Though arm'd from Cashbin or Damascus, wields A weaker sword; nor might that magic blade Compare with this, which Oriana saw Flame in the ruffian Ardan's robber hand, When, sick and cold as death, she turn'd away Her dizzy eyes, lest they should see the fall Of her own Amadis. Nor plated shield, Nor the strong hauberk, nor the crested casque, Stay that descending sword. Dreadful she moved, Like as the Angel of the Lord went forth And smote his army, when the Assyrian king, Haughty of Hamath and Sepharvaim fallen, Blasphemed the God of Israel. Yet the fight Hung doubtful, where exampling hardiest deeds, Salisbury struck down the foe, and Fastolffe strove, And in the hottest doings of the war Towered Talbot. He, remembering the past day When from his name the affrighted sons of France Fled trembling, all astonish'd at their force And wontless valour, rages round the field Dreadful in anger; yet in every man Meeting a foe fearless, and in the faith Of Heaven's assistance firm. The clang of arms Reaches the walls of Orleans. For the war Prepared, and confident of victory, Forth speed the troops. Not when afar exhaled The hungry raven snuffs the steam of blood That from some carcass-cover'd field of fame Taints the pure air, flies he more eagerly To feed upon the slain, than the Orleanites, Impatient now for many an ill endured In the long siege, to wreak upon their foes Due vengeance. Then more fearful grew the fray; The swords that late flash'd to the evening sun Now quench'd in blood their radiance. O'er the host Howl'd a deep wind that ominous of storms Roll'd on the lurid clouds. The blacken'd night Frown'd, and the thunder from the troubled sky Roar'd hollow. Javelins clash'd and bucklers rang; Shield prest on shield; loud on the helmet jarr'd The ponderous battle axe; the frequent groan Of death commingling with the storm was heard, And the shrill shriek of fear. Even such a storm Before the walls of Chartres quell'd the pride Of the third Edward, when the heavy hail Smote down his soldiers, and the conqueror heard God in the tempest, and remembered then With a remorseful sense of Christian fear What misery he had caused, and in the name Of blessed Mary vowed a vow of peace. Lo! where the holy banner waved aloft, The lambent lightnings play. Irradiate round, As with a blaze of glory, o'er the field It stream'd miraculous splendour. Then their hearts Sunk, and the English trembled; with such fear Possess'd, as when the Canaanites beheld The sun stand still on Gibeon, at the voice Of that king-conquering warrior, he who smote The country of the hills, and of the south, From Baal-gad to Halak, and their chiefs, Even as the Lord commanded. Swift they fled From that portentous banner, and the sword Of France; though Talbot with vain valiancy Yet urged the war, and stemm'd alone the tide Of battle. Even their leaders felt dismay; Fastolffe fled first, and Salisbury in the rout Mingled, and all impatient of defeat, Borne backward Talbot turns. Then echoed loud The cry of conquest, deeper grew the storm, And darkness, hovering o'er on raven wing, Brooded the field of death. Nor in the camp Deem themselves safe the trembling fugitives; On to the forts they haste. Bewilder'd there Amid the moats by fear and the thick gloom Of more than midnight darkness, plunge the troops, Crush'd by fast following numbers who partake The death they give. As swoln with vernal snows A mountain torrent hurries on its way, Till at the brink of some abrupt descent Arrived, with deafening clamour down it falls Thus borne along, tumultuously the troops Driven by the force behind them, plunge amid The liquid death. Then rose the dreadful cries More dreadful, and the dash of breaking waters That to the passing lightning as they broke Open'd their depth. Nor of the host so late Exultant in the pride of long success, A remnant had escaped, had not their chief, Slow as he moved unwilling from the field, What most might profit the defeated ranks Bethought him. He, when he had gain'd the fort Named from St. John, there kindled up on high The guiding fire. Not unobserved it rose; The watchful guards on Tournelles, and the pile Of that proud city in remembrance fond Call'd London, light their beacons. Soon the fires Flame on the summit of the circling forts Which with their moats and crenellated walls, Included Orleans. Far across the plain They cast a lurid splendor; to the troops Grateful, as to the way-worn traveller, Wandering with parch'd feet o'er Arabian sands, The far-seen cistern; he for many a league Travelling the trackless desolate, where heaved With tempest swell the desert billows round, Pauses, and shudders at his perils past, Then wild with joy speeds on to taste the wave So long bewail'd. Swift as the affrighted herd Scud o'er the plain, when rattling thunder-cracks Upon the bolted lightning follow close, The English hasten to their sheltering forts, Even there of safety doubtful, still appall'd And trembling, as the pilgrim who by night On his way wilder'd, to the wolf's deep howl Hears the wood echo, when from close pursuit Escaped, the topmost branch of some tall tree He grasps close clinging, still of the wild beast Fearful, his teeth jar, and the cold sweat stands Upon his clammy limbs. Nor now the Maid Greedy of vengeance presses the pursuit. She bids the trumpet of retreat resound; A welcome note to the affrighted foe Blew that loud blast, whereat obediently The French though eager on the invaders' heads To wreak their wrath, stay the victorious sword. Loud is the cry of conquest as they turn To Orleans. There what few to guard the town Unwilling had remain'd, haste forth to meet The triumph. Many a blazing torch they held, Which raised aloft amid the midnight storm Flash'd far a festive light. The Maid advanced; Deep through the sky the hollow thunders roll'd; Innocuous lightnings round the hallowed banner Wreath'd their red radiance. Through the city gate Then as the laden convoy pass'd was heard The shout of exultation; and such joy The men of Orleans at that welcome sight Possess'd, as when from Bactria late subdued, The mighty Macedonian led his troops Amid the Sogdian desert, where no stream Wastes on the wild its fertilizing waves. Fearful alike to pause, or to proceed; Scorch'd by the sun that o'er their morning march Steam'd his hot vapours, heart-subdued and faint; Such joy as then they felt, when from the heights Burst the soul-gladdening sound, for thence was seen The evening sun silvering the fertile vale, Where Oxus roll'd below. Clamours of joy Echo along the streets of Orleans, wont Long time to hear the infant's feeble cry, The mother's frantic shriek, or the dread sound, When from the cannon burst its stores of death. Far flames the fire of joy on ruin'd piles And high heap'd carcasses, whence scared away From his abhorred meal, on clattering wing Rose the night-raven slow. In the English forts Sad was the scene. There all the livelong night Steal in the straggling fugitives; as when Past is the storm, and o'er the azure sky Serenely shines the sun, with every breeze The waving branches drop their gather'd rain, Renewing the remembrance of the storm. THE SEVENTH BOOK. Strong were the English forts, by daily toil Of thousands rear'd on high, when to ensure His meditated conquest Salisbury Resolved from Orleans to shut out all means Of human succour. Round the city stretch'd Their line continuous, massy as the wall Erst by the fearful Roman on the bounds Of Caledonia raised, when soul-enslaved The race degenerate fear'd the car-borne chiefs Who moved from Morven down. Broad battlements Crested the bulwark, and safe standing place For archer or for man-at-arms was there. The frequent buttress at just distance rose Declining from its base, and sixty forts Seem'd in their strength to render all secure. But loftier and massier than the rest, As though of some large castle each the keep, Stood six square fortresses with turrets flank'd, Piles of unequall'd strength, though now deem'd weak 'Gainst puissance more than mortal. Safely thence The skilful bowman, entering with his eye The city, might, himself the while unseen, Through the long opening aim his winged deaths. Loire's waves diverted fill'd the deep-dug moat Circling the whole; a bulwark vast it was As that which round their camp and stranded ships The Achaians raised, a common sepulchre Of thousands slaughter'd, and the doom'd death-place Of many a chief, when Priam's virtuous son Assail'd them, then in hope, with favouring Jove. But cowering now amid their sheltering forts Trembled the invading host. Their leader's care In anxious vigilance prepares to ward The assault expected. Rightly he ared The Maid's intent, but vainly did he seek To kindle in their breasts the wonted flame Of valour; for, by prodigies unmann'd, They wait the morn. The soldiers' pride was gone; The blood was on their swords, their bucklers lay Defiled and unrepair'd, they sharpen'd not Their blunted spears, the affrighted archer's hand Relax'd not his bent bow. To them, confused With fears of unknown danger, the long night Was dreadful, but more dreadful dawn'd the day. The morning came; the martial Maid arose; Lovely in arms she moved. Around the gate, Eager again for conquest, throng the troops. High tower'd the Son of Orleans, in his strength Poising the ponderous spear. His batter'd shield, Witnessing the fierce fray of yesternight, Hung on his sinewy arm. “Maiden of Are,” So as he spake approaching, cried the chief, “Well hast thou proved thy mission, as by words And miracles attested when dismay'd The grave theologists dismiss'd their doubts, So in the field of battle now confirm'd. Yon well-fenced forts protect the fugitives, And seem as in their strength they mock'd our force. Yet must they fall.” “And fall they shall!” replied The Maid of Orleans. “Ere the sun be set The lily on that shattered wall shall wave Triumphant.— Men of France! ye have fought well On yon blood-reeking plain. Your humbled foes Lurk trembling now behind their massy walls. Wolves that have ravaged the neglected flock! The Shepherd—the Great Shepherd is arisen! Ye fly! yet shall not ye by flight escape His vengeance. Men of Orleans! it were vain By words to waken wrath within your breasts. Look round! Your holy buildings and your homes— Ruins that choke the way! your populous town— One open sepulchre! who is there here That does not mourn a friend, a brother slain, A parent famished, . . or his dear loved wife Torn from his bosom.. outcast.. broken-hearted.. Cast on the mercy of mankind?” She ceased; A cry of indignation from the host Burst forth, and all impatient for the war Demand the signal. These Dunois arrays In four battalions. Xaintrailles, tried in war, Commands the first; Xaintrailles, who oftentimes Defeated, oft a prisoner, and as oft Released for ransom, both with friend and foe Growing repute of active hardihood, And martial skill obtained; so erst from earth Antæus vaunting in his giant bulk, When graspt by force Herculean, down he fell Vanquish'd, anon uprose more fierce for war. Gaucour the second battle led, true friend And faithful servant of the imprison'd Duke; In counsel provident, in action prompt, Collected always, always self-controul'd, He from the soldiers' confidence and love Prompter obedience gain'd, than ever fear Forced from the heart reluctant. The third band Alençon leads. On Verneuil's fatal field The day when Buchan and the Douglas died, Wounded and senseless with the loss of blood, He fell, and there being found, was borne away A prisoner, in the ills of that defeat Participant, partaking not the shame: But for his rank and high desert, the King Had ransom'd him, doom'd now to meet the foe With better fortune. O'er the last presides The bastard son of Orleans, great in arms. His prowess knew the foes, and his fair fame Acknowledged, since before his stripling arm Fled Warwick; Warwick, he whose wide renown Greece knew and Antioch and the holy soil Of Palestine, since there in arms he went On gallant pilgrimage; yet by Dunois Baffled, and yielding him the conqueror's praise. And by his side the martial Maiden pass'd, Lovely in arms as that Arcadian boy Parthenopæus, when the war of beasts Disdaining, he to cope with men went forth, Bearing the bow and those Dictæan shafts Diana gave, when she the youth's fair form Saw, soften'd, and forgave the mother's fault. Loup's was the nearest fort. Here Gladdisdale Commands the English, who as the enemy Moved to the assault, from bow and arbalist Their shafts and quarrels shower'd. Nor did they use Hand-weapons only and hand-engines here, Nor by the arm alone, or bow-string sped The missile flew, but driven by the strain'd force Of the balista, in one body spent Stay'd not; through arms and men it made its way, And leaving death behind, still held its course By many a death unclogg'd. With rapid march Onward the assailants came, and now they reach'd Where by the bayle's embattled wall in arms The knights of England stood. There Poynings shook His lance, and Gladdisdale his heavy mace For the death-blow prepared. Alençon here, And here the Bastard came, and by the Maid, That daring man who to the English host Then insolent of many a conquest gain'd, Had borne her bidding. A rude coat of mail Unhosed, unhooded, as of lowly line He wore, though here amid the high-born chiefs Pre-eminent for prowess. On his head A black plume shadow'd the rude-featured helm. Then was the war of men, when front to front They rear'd the hostile hand, for low the wall Where an assailant's upward-driven spear Might reach his enemy. As Alençon moved, On his crown-crested helm with ponderous blow Fell Gladdisdale's huge mace. Back he recoil'd Astounded; soon recovering, his sharp lance Thrust on the warrior's shield: there fast-infixed, Nor could Alençon the deep-driven spear Recover, nor the foeman from his grasp Wrench the contended weapon. Fierce again He lifts the mace, that on the ashen hilt Fell full; it shiver'd, and the Frenchman held A pointless truncheon. Where the Bastard fought, The spear of Poynings, through his plated mail Pierced, and against the iron fence beneath Blunted its point. Again he thrust the spear; At once Dunois on his broad buckler met The unharming stroke, and aim'd with better hap His javelin. Through his sword-arm did it pierce Maugre the mail: hot from the streaming wound He pluck'd the weapon forth, and in his breast Clean through the hauberk drove. But there the war Raged fiercest where the martial Maiden moved A minister of wrath; for thither throng'd The bravest champions of the adverse host. And on her either side two warriors stood Protecting her, and aiming at her foes Watchful their weapons, of themselves the while Little regarding: on the one side he Who to the English had her bidding borne; Firmly he stood, untired and undismay'd, Though many a spear against his burgonet Was thrust, and on his arm the buckler hung Heavy, thick-bristled with the hostile shafts, Even like a porcupine when in his rage Roused, he collects within him all his force, Himself a quiver. On the other hand Competing with him to protect the Maid, Conrade maintain'd the fight; at all points arm'd, A jazerent of double mail he wore, Its weight in little time had wearied one Of common strength; but unencumber'd he And unfatigued, alertly moved in it, And wielded with both hands a battle-axe, Which gave no second stroke; for where it fell, Not the strong buckler nor the plated mail Might save, nor crested casque. On Molyn's head, As at the Maid he aim'd his javelin, Forceful it fell, and shiver'd with the blow The iron helm, and to his brain-pan drove The fragments. At his fall the enemy, Stricken with instantaneous fear, gave way. That instant Conrade, with an active bound, Sprung on the battlements; and there he stood, Keeping the ascent. The herald and the Maid Follow'd, and soon the exulting cry of France Along the lists was heard, as there they saw Her banner planted. Gladdisdale beheld, And hastened from his well-defended post, That where immediate danger more required There he might take his stand; against the Maid He bent his way, and hoped one happy blow Might end at once the new-raised hopes of France, And by her death, to the English arms their old Ascendancy restore. Nor did not Joan Areed his purpose, but with lifted shield Prepared she stood, and poised her sparkling spear. The English chief came on; he raised his mace; With circling force the iron weight swung high, And Gladdisdale with his collected strength Impell'd the blow. The man of lowly line That instant rush'd between, and rear'd his shield And met the broken stroke, and thrust his lance Clean through the gorget of the English knight. A gallant man, of no ignoble line, Was Gladdisdale. His sires had lived in peace; They heap'd the hospitable hearth, they spread The feast, their vassals loved them, and afar The traveller told their fame. In peace they died, And to their ancient burial-place were borne With book and bell, torches, and funeral chaunt; And duly for their souls the neighbouring monks The solemn office sung. Now far away Their offspring falls, the last of all his race, Slain in a foreign land, and doom'd to share A common grave. Then terror seized the host, Their chieftain dead. And lo! where on the wall, Maintain'd of late by Gladdisdale so well, The Son of Orleans stands, and sways around His falchion, keeping thus at bay the foe, Till on the battlements his comrades climb And raise the shout of conquest. Then appall'd The English fled: nor fled they unpursued, For mingling with the foremost fugitives, The gallant Conrade rush'd; and with the throng The knights of France together o'er the bridge Press'd forward. Nor the garrison within Durst let the ponderous portcullis fall, For in the entrance of the fort the fight Raged fiercely, and together through the gate The vanquish'd English and their eager foes Pass'd in the flying conflict. Well I deem And wisely did the heroic Spaniard act At Vera-Cruz, when he his yet sound ships Dismantling, left no spot where treacherous fear Might still with wild and wistful eye look back: For knowing no retreat, his desperate troops In conquest sought their safety; victors hence At Tlascala, and o'er the Cholulans, And by Otompan, on that bloody field When Mexico her patriot thousands pour'd, Fierce in vain valour, on their dreadful foes. There was a portal in the English fort Which open'd on the wall; a speedier path In the hour of safety, whence the soldier's eye Might overlook the river's pleasant course. Fierce in the gate-way raged the deadly war; For there the Maiden strove, and Conrade there; And he of lowly line, bravelier than whom Fought not in that day's battle. Of success Desperate, for from above the garrison (Lest upon friend and enemy alike The indiscriminating blow should light,) Could give no aid, the English of that way Bethought them; by that egress they forsook St. Loup's, and the Orleanites with shouts of joy Beheld the Virgin's banner on its height In triumph planted. Swift along the wall The English haste to St. John's neighbouring fort, Flying with fearful speed. Nor from pursuit The victors ceased, but with the fugitives Mingled and waged the war; and combatants, Lock'd in each other's grasp, together fell Precipitate. But foremost of the French, Dealing destruction, Conrade made his way Along the wall, and to the nearest fort Came in pursuit; nor did not then the chief What most might serve bethink him; but he took His stand in the portal, and first looking back, Lifted his voice aloud; three times he raised, Cheering and calling on his countrymen, That voice o'er all the uproar heard afar, Then to the strife addrest himself, assail'd By numerous foes, who clamorously now Menaced his single person. He the while Stood firm, not vainly confident, or rash, But in his vantage more than his own strength Trusting; for narrow was the portal way, To one alone fit passage, from above Not overbrow'd by jutting parapet, Whence aught might crush him. He in double mail Was arm'd; a massy burgonet, well tried In many a hard-fought field, helming his head; And fenced with iron plates, a buckler broad Hung from his neck. Nor to dislodge the chief Could the English bring their numbers, for the way By upward steps presented from the fort A narrow ascent, where one alone could meet The war. Yet were they of their numbers proud, Though useless numbers were in that strait path, Save by assault unceasing to out-last A single warrior, who at length must sink Fatigued with slaughter, and by toil foredone Succumb. There was amid the garrison A gallant knight who at Verneuil had fought, And good renown for feats of arms achieved Had gain'd in that day's victory. For him His countrymen made way, and he his lance Thrust upward against Conrade, who perceived The intent, and as the weapon touch'd his shield Smote with his battle-axe the ashen shaft; Then plucking from the shield the severed head, He threw it back. With wary bend the foe Shrunk from the flying death; yet not in vain From that strong hand the fate-fraught weapon flew: Full on the corslet of a meaner man It fell, and pierced him where the heaving lungs, In vital play distended, to the heart Roll back their brighten'd tide: from the deep wound The red blood gush'd; prone on the steps he fell, And in the strong convulsive grasp of death Grasp'd his long pike. Of unrecorded name The soldier died; and yet he left behind One who then never said her daily prayers Of him forgetful; who to every tale Of the distant war lending an eager ear, Grew pale and trembled. At her cottage door The wretched one shall sit, and with fix'd eye Gaze on the path, where on his parting steps Her last look hung. Nor ever shall she know Her husband dead, but cherishing a hope, Whose falsehood inwardly she knows too well, Feel life itself with that false hope decay; And wake at night from miserable dreams Of his return, and weeping o'er her babe, Too surely think that soon that fatherless child Must of its mother also be bereft. Dropping his broken spear, the exasperate knight Drew forth the sword, and up the steps advanced, Like one who disregarded in his strength The enemy's vantage, destined to abide That rashness dearly. Conrade stood prepared, Held forth his buckler, and his battle-axe Uplifted. Where the buckler was beneath Rounded, the falchion struck, a bootless blow To pierce its plated folds; more forcefully Full on his crested helm the battle-axe Descended, driving in both crest and crown; From the knight's eyes at that death-stroke, the blood Started; with blood the chambers of the brain Were fill'd; his breast-plate with convulsive throes Heaved as he fell. Victorious, he the prize At many a tournament had borne away In mimic war; happy, if so content With bloodless glory, he had never left The mansion of his sires. But terrified The English stood, nor durst adventure now Near that death-doing foe. Amid their host Was one who well could from the stubborn yew Send his sharp shafts; well skill'd in wood-craft he, Even as the merry outlaws who their haunts In Sherwood held, and bade their bugles rouse The sleeping stag, ere on the web-woven grass The dew-drops sparkled to the rising sun. He safe in distance at the warrior aim'd The feather'd dart; with force he drew the bow; Loud on his bracer struck the sounding string, And swift and strong the well-fledged arrow flew. It pierced the shield, and reach'd, but reach'd in vain, The breast-plate: while he fitted to the bow A second arrow, Conrade raised his voice, Shouting for timely succour to secure The entrance he had gain'd. Nor was the call Unheard, nor unobey'd; responsive shouts Announced assistance nigh; the Orleanites From St. Loup's captured fort along the wall Sped to support him; cheering was the sound Of their near footsteps to the chief; he drew His falchion forth, and down the steps he went. Then terror seized the English, for their foes Press'd thro' the open portal, and the sword Of Conrade was among them making way. Not to the Trojans when their ships were lost More dreadful the Rutilian hero seem'd, Then hoping well to right himself in arms; Nor with more fury through the streets of Paris Rush'd the fierce king of Sarza, Rodomont, Clad in his dragon mail. Like some tall rock, Around whose billow-beaten foot the waves Spend their vain force, unshaken Conrade stood, When drawing courage from despair the foe Renew'd the contest. Through the throng he hew'd His way unhurt amid the arrowy shower, Though on his shield and helm the darts fell fast, As the sear'd leaves that from the trembling tree The autumnal whirlwind shakes. Nor did he pause Till to the gate he came, and with strong hand Seized on the massy bolts. These as he drew, Full on his helm a weighty English sword Descended; swift he turn'd to wreak his wrath, When lo! the assailant gasping on the ground, Cleft by the Maiden's falchion: she herself To the foe opposing with her herald's aid, For they alone, following the adventurous steps Of Conrade, still kept pace as he advanced, Shielded him while with eager hand he drew The bolts: the gate turn'd slow; forth leapt the chief, And shiver'd with his battle-axe the chains That held on high the bridge: down fell the bridge Rebounding; the victorious troops rush'd in; And from their walls the Orleanites with shouts And tears of joy beheld on Fort St. John The lilies wave. “On to Fort London! on!” Cried Conrade; “Xaintrailles! while the day endures Once more advance to certain victory! Force ye the lists, and fill the moat, and bring The battering-ram against their gates and walls. Anon I shall be with you.” Thus he said; Then to the damsel. “Maid of Arc! awhile Let thou and I withdraw, and by short rest Renew our strength.” So saying he his helm Unlaced, and in the Loire's near flowing stream Cool'd his hot face. The Maid her head unhelm'd, And stooping to the stream, reflected there Saw her white plumage stain'd with human blood! Shuddering she saw, but soon her steady soul Collected: on the banks she laid her down, Freely awhile respiring, for her breath Still panted from the fight: silent they lay, And gratefully the cooling breezes bathed Their throbbing temples. Eve was drawing on: The sun-beams on the gently-waving stream Danced sparkling. Lost in thought the warrior lay, Then as if wakening from a dream he said, “Maiden of Arc! at such an hour as this, Beneath the o'er-arching forest's chequer'd shade, With that lost woman have I wander'd on, Talking of years of happiness to come! Oh! hours for ever fled! delightful hopes Of the unsuspecting heart! I do believe If Agnes on a worthier one had fix'd Her love, that though my heart had nurst till death Its sorrows, I had never on her choice Cast one upbraiding.. but to stoop to him! A harlot! . . an adulteress!” In his eye Fierce anger flash'd; anon of what she was Ere the contagious vices of the court Polluted her, he thought. “Oh, happy age!” He cried, “when all the family of man Freely enjoy'd their goodly heritage, And only bow'd the knee in prayer to God! Calm flow'd the unruffled stream of years along, Till o'er the peaceful rustic's head the hair Grew grey in full of time. Then he would sit Beneath the coetaneous oak, while round, Sons, grandsons and their offspring join'd to form The blameless merriment; and learnt of him What time to yoke the oxen to the plow, What hollow moanings of the western wind Foretell the storm, and in what lurid clouds The embryo lightning lies. Well pleased, he taught, A heart-smile glowing on his aged cheek, Mild as the summer sun's decaying light. Thus quietly the stream of life flow'd on, Till in the shoreless ocean lost at length. Around the bed of death his numerous race Listen'd, in no unprofitable grief, His last advice, and caught his latest sigh: And when he died, as he had fallen asleep, In his own ground, and underneath the tree Which, planted at his birth, with him had grown, And flourish'd in its strength when he decay'd, They delved the narrow house: where oft at eve Their children's children gathered round to hear The example of his life and death impress'd. Maiden! and such the evening of my days Fondly I hoped; and would that I had lived In those old times, or till some better age Slumber'd unborn; for this is a hard race, An evil generation; nor by day Nor in the night have respite from their cares And wretchedness. But I shall be at rest Soon, in that better world of peace and love Where evil is not: in that better world, Joan! we shall meet, and he too will be there, Thy Theodore.” Soothed by his words, the Maid Had listen'd sadly, till at that loved name She wept. “Nay, Maid!” he cried, “I did not think To wake a tear; . . . yet pleasant is thy grief! Thou know'st not what it is, around thy heart To have a false one wreathe in viper folds. But to the battle! in the clang of arms, We win forgetfulness.” Then from the bank He sprung, and helm'd his head. The Maid arose Bidding awhile adieu to gentle thoughts. On to the fort they speed, whose name recall'd England's proud capital to the English host, Now half subdued, anticipating death, And vainly wishing they from her white cliffs Had never spread the sail. Cold terror creeps Through every nerve: already they look round With haggard eyes, as seeking where to fly, Though Talbot there presided, with their chief, The dauntless Salisbury. “Soldiers tried in arms! Thus, hoping to revive with gallant speech Their courage, Salisbury spake; “Brave countrymen, Victorious in so many a hard-fought fight, What... shrink ye now dismay'd? Oh call to mind The plains of Agincourt, where vanquish'd France Fled with her thousands from your fathers' arms? Have ye forgotten how our English swords, On that illustrious day before Verneuil, Cut down the flower of all their chivalry? Then was that noble heart of Douglas pierced, Bold Buchan bit the earth, and Narbonne died, And this Alençon, boaster as he is, Cried mercy to his conqueror. Shall I speak Of our victorious banner on the walls Of Yenville and Baugenci triumphing: And of that later hour of victory When Clermont and the Bastard plied their spurs? Shame! shame! that beaten boy is here in arms, And ye will fly before the fugitives, . . Fly from a woman! from a frantic girl! Who with her empty mummeries tries to blast Your courage; or if miracles she bring, Aid of the Devil! Who is there among you False to his country, . . to his former fame, To your old leader who so many a time Hath led ye on to glory?” From the host There came a heartless shout; then Talbot's cheek Grew red with indignation. “Earl!” said he, Addressing Salisbury: “there is no hope From these white-liver'd dastards, and this fort Will fall an easy conquest. We must out And gain the Tournelles, better fortified, Fit to endure a siege: that hope in view, Cow'd as they are, the men from very fear May gather what will do for this poor turn The work of courage.” Bravely thus he spake, Advising well, and Salisbury replied; “Rightly thou say'st. But, Talbot, could we reach The sorceress in the battle, one sure blow Might give us back, this hour, the mastery So marvellously lost: nor difficult To meet the wench, for from the battlements I have beheld her foremost in attack, Playing right valiantly the soldier's part. In her the enemy have their strength, with her Their strength would fall. And had we her but once Within arm-stroke, witch though she be, methinks Her devilry could neither blunt the edge Of thy good sword, or mine.” Thus communed they, And through the host the gladdening tidings ran, That they should seek the Tournelles. Then their hearts Gather'd new strength, placing on those strong walls Dependence; oh vain hope! for neither wall, Nor moat, nor fort can save, if fear within Palsy the soldier's arm. Them issuing forth, As from the river's banks they pass'd along, The Maid beheld. “Lo! Conrade!” she exclaim'd, “The foe advance to meet us.. look! they lower The bridge! and now they rush upon the troops: . . A gallant onset! Dost thou mark the man Who all this day has by our side endured The hottest conflict? Often I beheld His feats with wonder, but his prowess now Makes all his actions in the former fight Seem as of no account: knowest thou him? There is not one amid the host of France, Of fairer promise.” “He,” the chief replied, “Wretched and prodigal of life, achieves The exploits of despair; a gallant youth, Widow'd like me of hope, and but for whom I had been seen among mankind no more. Maiden! with me thy comrade in the war, His arm is vow'd to heaven. Lo! where he stands Bearing the battle's brunt!” Nor paused they now In farther converse, to the perilous fray Speeding, not unobserved; for Salisbury saw And call'd on Talbot. Six, the bravest knights And sworn with them, against the virgin's life Address'd their course. She by the herald's side Now urged the war, when on her white-plumed helm The hostile falchion fell. On high she lifts That hallowed sword, which in the tomb for her Age after age, by miracle reserved, Had lain, which time itself could not corrode, How then might shield, or breast-plate, or close mail Retund its edge? Beneath that edge her foe Fell; and the knight who to avenge him came, Smitten by Conrade's battle-axe, was fell'd Upon his dying friend. With Talbot here The daring herald urged unequal fight; For like some oak that in its rooted strength Defies the storm, the undaunted Earl endured His quick assault. The herald round him wheels Rapidly, now on this side, now on that, With many a feign'd and many a frustrate aim Flashing his falchion; now, as he perceives With wary eye the Earl's intended stroke, Bending, or leaping, lithe of limb, aside, Then quick and agile in assault again. Ill-fated man! one deed of glory more Shall with the short-lived lightning's splendor grace This thy death-day; for Slaughter even now Stands o'er thy loom of life, and lifts his sword. Upon her shield the martial Maid received An English warrior's blow, and in his side, Beneath the arm upraised, in prompt return Pierced him: that instant Salisbury sped his sword, Which glancing from her helm fell on the folds That arm'd her neck, and making there its way, Stain'd with her blood its edge. The herald saw, And turn'd from Talbot, heedless of himself, And lifting up his falchion, all his force Concenter'd. On the breast of Salisbury It fell, and cleft his mail, and thro' the plate Beneath it drove, and in his heart's-blood plunged. Lo! as he struck the mighty Talbot came, And smote his helmet: slant the weapon fell; The strings gave way, the helmet dropt, the Earl Repeated on that head disarm'd his blow: Too late to interpose the Maiden saw, And in that miserable moment knew Her Theodore. Him Conrade too had seen, And from a foe whom he had beaten down Turn'd terrible in vengeance. Front to front They stood, and each for the death-blow prepared His angry might. At once their weapons fell, The Frenchman's battle-axe, and the good sword Of Talbot. He, stunn'd by the weighty blow, Sunk senseless, by his followers from the field Convey'd with timely speed: nor had his blade Fallen vainly on the Frenchman's crested helm, Tho' weak to wound; for from his eyes the fire Sparkled, and back recoiling with the blow, He in the Maiden's arms astounded fell. But now their troops all captainless confused, Fear seized the English. Not with more dismay When over wild Caffraria's wooded hills Echoes the lion's roar, the timid herd Fly the death-boding sound. The forts they seek, Now reckless which, so from that battle's rage A present refuge. On their flying ranks The victors press, and mark their course with blood. But loud the trumpet of retreat resounds, For now the westering sun with many a hue Streak'd the gay clouds. “Dunois!” the Maiden cried, “Form now around yon stronger pile the siege, There for the night encamping.” So she said. The chiefs to Orleans for their needful food, And enginery to batter that huge pile, Dismiss'd troop, and round the Tournelles led The host beleaguering. There they pitch their tents, And plant their engines for the morrow's war, Then to their meal, and o'er the cheerful bowl Recount the tale of danger; soon to rest Betaking them, for now the night drew on. THE EIGHTH BOOK. Now was the noon of night, and all was still, Save where the sentinel paced on his rounds Humming a broken song. Along the camp High flames the frequent fire. The Frenchmen there, On the bare earth extended, rest their limbs Fatigued, their spears lay by them, and the shield Pillow'd the helmed head: secure they slept, And busy in their dreams they fought again The fight of yesterday. But not to Joan, But not to her, most wretched, came thy aid, Soother of sorrows, Sleep! no more her pulse, Amid the battle's tumult throbbing fast, Allow'd no pause for thought. With clasp'd hands now And with fix'd eyes she sat, and in her mind The spectres of the days departed rose, A melancholy train! Upon the gale The raven's croak was heard; she started then, And passing through the camp with hasty step She sought the field of blood. The night was calm; Nor ever clearer welkin canopied Chaldea, while the watchful shepherd's eye Survey'd the host of heaven, and mark'd them rise Successive, and successively decay, Lost in the stream of light, as lesser springs Amid Euphrates' current. The high wall Cast a deep shadow, and the Maiden's feet Stumbled o'er carcasses and broken arms; And sometimes did she hear the heavy groan Of one yet struggling in the pangs of death. She reach'd the spot where Theodore was slain Before Fort London's gate; but vainly there Sought she the youth, on every clay-cold face Gazing with such a look as though she fear'd The thing she sought. And much she marvell'd then, For there the victim of his vengeful arm, And close beside where he himself had fallen, Known by the buckler's blazon'd heraldry, Salisbury lay dead. So as the Virgin stood Looking around the plain, she mark'd a man Pass slowly on, as burthen'd. Him to aid She sped, and soon with unencumber'd speed O'ertaking, thus bespake him: “Dost thou bear Some slaughter'd friend? or is it one whose wounds Leave yet a hope of life? oh! if he lives, I will with earnest prayer petition heaven To shed its healing on him!” So she said, And as she spake stretch'd forth her careful hands To ease the burthen. “Warrior!” he replied, “Thanks for thy proffer'd aid: but he hath ceased To suffer, and my strength may well suffice To bear him hence for burial. Fare thee well! The night is far advanced; thou to the camp Return: it fits not darkling thus to stray.” “Conrade!” the Maid exclaim'd, for well she knew His voice: . . . With that she fell upon his neck And cried, “my Theodore! . . . But wherefore thus Through the dead midnight dost thou bear his corse?” “Peace, Maiden!” Conrade cried, “collect thy soul! He is but gone before thee to that world Whither thou soon must follow! Yestermorn, Ere yet from Orleans to the war we went, He pour'd his tale of sorrow on mine ear. Lo, Conrade, where she moves! beloved Maid! Devoted for the realm of France she goes, Abandoning for this the joys of life, Yea.. life itself! Yet on my heart her words Vibrate. If she must perish in the war, I will not live to bear the thought that I Perhaps might have preserved her. I will go In secret to protect her. If I fall, . . And trust me I have little love of life, . . Do thou in secret bear me from the field, Lest haply I might meet her wandering eye A mangled corpse. She must not know my fate. Do this last act of friendship, and in the stream Cast me, . . she then may think of Theodore Without a pang.” Maiden, I vow'd with him To take our place in battle by thy side, And make thy safety our peculiar care. And now I hoped thou hadst not seen him fall.” Saying thus he laid the body on the ground. With steady eye the wretched Maiden view'd That life-left tenement: his batter'd arms Were with the night-dews damp; his brown hair clung Gore-clotted in the wound, and one loose lock Play'd o'er his cheek's black paleness. “Gallant youth!” She cried, “I would to God the hour were come When I might meet thee in the bowers of bliss! No, Theodore! the sport of winds and waves Thy body shall not float adown the stream! Bear him with me to Orleans, there to rest In holy ground, where priests may say their prayers And hymn the requiem to his parted soul. So will not Elinor in bitterness Lament that no dear friend to her dead child Paid the last office.” From the earth they lift Their mournful burthen, and along the plain Pass with slow footsteps to the city gate. The obedient centinel, knowing Conrade's voice, Admits them at that hour, and on they go, Till in the neighbouring abbey's porch arrived They rest the lifeless load. Loud rings the bell; The awaken'd porter turns the heavy door. To him the Virgin! “Father, from the slain On yonder field, a dear-loved friend we bring Hither for Christian sepulture: chant ye The requiem to his soul: to-morrow eve I will return, and in the narrow house Will see him laid to rest.” The father knew The Prophetess, and humbly bow'd assent. Now from the city, o'er the shadowy plain, Backward they bend their way. From silent thoughts The Maid awakening cried, “There was a time, When thinking on my closing hour of life, Though with a mind resolved, some natural fears Shook my weak frame: but now the happy hour, When this emancipated soul shall burst The cumbrous fetters of mortality, I look for wishfully. Conrade! my friend, This wounded heart would feel another pang Shouldst thou forsake me.” “Joan!” the chief replied, “Along the weary pilgrimage of life Together will we journey, and beguile The painful way with hope, . . such hope as fix'd On heavenly things, brings with it no deceit, Lays up no food for sorrow, and endures From disappointment safe.” Thus communing They reach'd the camp, yet hush'd; there separating, Each in the post allotted, restless waits The day-break. Morning came: dim through the shade The twilight glimmers; soon the brightening clouds Imbibe the rays, and o'er the landscape spread The dewy light. The soldiers from the earth Arise invigorate, and each his food Receives, impatient to renew the war. Dunois his javelin to the Tournelles points, “Soldiers of France! behold your foes are there!” As when a band of hunters, round the den Of some wood-monster, point their spears, elate In hope of conquest and the future feast, When on the hospitable board their spoil Shall smoke, and they, as foaming bowls go round, Tell to their guests their exploits in the chase; They with their shouts of exultation make The forest ring; so elevate of heart, With such loud clamours for the fierce assault The French prepare. Nor, keeping now the lists Dare the disheartened English man to man Meet the close conflict. From the barbican, Or from the embattled wall at random they Their arrows and their death-fraught enginery Discharged; meantime the Frenchmen did not cease With well-directed shafts their loftier foes To assail: behind the guardian pavais fenced, They at the battlements their arrows aim'd, Showering an iron storm, whilst o'er the bayle, The bayle now levell'd by victorious France, The assailants pass'd with all their mangonels; Or tortoises, beneath whose roofing safe, They, filling the deep moat, might for the towers Make fit foundation; or with petraries, War-wolves, and beugles, and that murderous sling The matafund, from whence the ponderous stone Made but one wound of him whom in its way, It met; no pious hand might then compose The crush'd and mangled corpse to be conveyed To where his fathers slept: a dreadful train Prepared by Salisbury o'er the town besieged For hurling ruin; but that dreadful train Must hurl its ruin on the invader's head, Such retribution righteous heaven decreed. Nor lie the English trembling, for the fort Was ably garrison'd. Glacidas, the chief, A gallant man, sped on from place to place Cheering the brave; or if an archer's hand, Palsied with fear, shot wide his ill-aim'd shaft, Driving him from the ramparts with reproach And shame. He bore an arbalist himself, A weapon for its sure destructiveness Abominated once; wherefore of yore The assembled fathers of the Christian church Pronounced the man accursed whose impious hand Should use the murderous engine. Such decrees Befitted them as ministers of peace, To promulgate, and with a warning voice, To cry aloud and spare not, ‘woe to them Whose hands are full of blood!’ An English king, The lion-hearted Richard, their decree First broke, and rightly was he doom'd to fall By that forbidden weapon; since that day Frequent in fields of battle, and from far To many a good knight bearing his death wound From hands unknown. With such an instrument Arm'd on the ramparts, Glacidas his eye Cast on the assailing host. A keener glance Darts not the hawk when from the feather's tribe He marks his prey. A Frenchman for his aim He chose, who kneeling by the trebuchet, Charged its long sling with death. Him Glacidas Secure behind the battlements, beheld, And strung his bow; then bending on one knee, He in the groove the feather'd quarrel placed, And levelling with sure eye, his victim mark'd. The bow-string twang'd, swift on its way the dart Whizz'd, and it struck, there where the helmet's clasps Defend the neck; a weak protection now, For through the tube which draws the breath of life Pierced the keen shaft; blood down the unwonted way Gush'd to the lungs: prone fell the dying man Grasping, convulsed, the earth; a hollow groan In his throat struggled, and the dews of death Stood on his livid cheek. The days of youth He had pass'd peaceful, and had known what joys Domestic love bestows, the father once Of two fair children; in the city hemm'd During the siege, he had beheld their cheeks Grow pale with famine, and had heard their cries For bread. His wife, a broken-hearted one, Sunk to the cold grave's quiet, and her babes With hunger pined, and follow'd; he survived, A miserable man, and heard the shouts Of joy in Orleans, when the Maid approach'd, As o'er the corpse of his last little one He heap'd the unhallowed earth. To him the foe Perform'd a friendly part, hastening the hour Grief else had soon brought on. The English chief, Pointing again his arbalist, let loose The string; the quarrel, by that impact driven, True to its aim, fled fatal: one it struck Dragging a tortoise to the moat, and fix'd Deep in his liver; blood and mingled gall Flow'd from the wound, and writhing with keen pangs, Headlong he fell. He for the wintry hour Knew many a merry ballad and quaint tale, A man in his small circle well-beloved. None better knew with prudent hand to guide The vine's young tendrils, or at vintage time To press the full-swoln clusters; he, heart-glad, Taught his young boys the little all he knew, Enough for happiness. The English host Laid waste his fertile fields: he, to the war, By want compell'd, adventured, in his gore Now weltering. Nor the Gallic host remit Their eager efforts; some, the watery fence, Beneath the tortoise roof'd, with engines apt Drain painful; part, laden with wood, throw there Their buoyant burthens, labouring so to gain Firm footing: some the mangonels supply, Or charging with huge stones the murderous sling, Or petrary, or in the espringal Fix the brass-winged arrows: hoarse around The uproar and the din of multitudes Arose. Along the ramparts Gargrave went, Cheering the English troops; a bow he bore; The quiver rattled as he moved along. He knew aright to aim his feather'd shafts, Well-skill'd to pierce the mottled roebuck's side, O'ertaken in his speed. Him passing on, A ponderous stone from some huge martinet, Struck: on his breast-plate falling, the huge weight Shattered the bone, and to his mangled lungs Drove in the fragments. On the gentle brow Of a fair hill, wood-circled, stood his home, A stately mansion, far and wide from whence The sight ranged unimpeded, and survey'd Streams, hills, and forests, fair variety! The traveller knew its hospitable towers, For open were the gates, and blazed for all The friendly fire. By glory lured, the youth Went forth; and he had bathed his falchion's edge In many a Frenchman's blood; now crush'd beneath The ponderous fragments force, his lifeless limbs Lie quivering. Lo! towards the levelled moat, A moving tower the men of Orleans wheel Four stages elevate. Above was hung, Equalling the walls, a bridge; in the lower stage A battering-ram: within a chosen troop Of archers, through the opening, shot their shafts. In the loftiest part was Conrade, so prepared To mount the rampart; for, no hunter he, He loved to see the dappled foresters Browze fearless on their lair, with friendly eye, And happy in beholding happiness, Not meditating death: the bowman's art Therefore he little knew, nor was he wont To aim the arrow at the distant foe, But uprear in close conflict, front to front, His battle-axe, and break the shield and helm, First in the war of men. There too the Maid Awaits, impatient on the wall to wield Her falchion. Onward moves the heavy tower, Slow o'er the moat and steady, though the foe Shower'd there their javelins, aim'd their engines there, And from the arbalist the fire-tipt dart Shot burning through the sky. In vain it flamed, For well with many a reeking hide secured, Pass'd on the dreadful pile, and now it reach'd The wall. Below, with forceful impulse driven, The iron-headed engine swings its stroke, Then back recoils; while they within who guide, In backward step collecting all their strength, Anon the massy beam with stronger arm Drive full and fierce. So rolls the swelling sea Its curly billows to the unmoved foot Of some huge promontory, whose broad base Breaks the rough wave; the shiver'd surge rolls back, Till, by the coming billow borne, it bursts Again, and foams with ceaseless violence: The wanderer, on the sunny clift outstretch'd, Harks to the roaring surges, as they rock His weary senses to forgetfulness. But nearer danger threats the invaders now, For on the ramparts, lower'd from above The bridge reclines. An universal shout Rose from the hostile hosts. The exultant French Break out in loud rejoicing, whilst the foe Raise a responsive cry, and call aloud For speedy succour there, with deafening shout Cheering their comrades. Not with louder din The mountain-torrent flings precipitate Its bulk of waters, though amid the fall Shatter'd, and dashing silvery from the rock. Lo! on the bridge forth comes the undaunted man, Conrade! the gather'd foes along the wall Throng opposite, and on him point their pikes, Cresting with armed men the battlements. He undismay'd, though on that perilous height, Stood firm, and hurl'd his javelin; the keen point Pierced through the destined victim, where his arm Join'd the broad breast: a wound which skilful care Haply had heal'd; but, him disabled now For farther service, the unpitying throng Of his tumultuous comrades from the wall Thrust headlong. Nor did Conrade cease to throw His deadly javelins fast, for well within The tower was stored with weapons, to his hand Quickly supplied. Nor did the mission'd Maid Rest idle from the combat; she, secure, Aim'd the keen quarrel, taught the cross-bow's use By the willing mind that what it well desires Gains aptly: nor amid the numerous throng, Though haply erring from their destin'd mark, Sped her sharp arrows frustrate. From the tower Ceaseless the bow-strings twang: the knights below, Each by his pavais bulwark'd, thither aim'd Their darts, and not a dart fell woundless there; So thickly throng'd they stood, and fell as fast As when the monarch of the East goes forth From Gemna's banks and the proud palaces Of Delhi, the wild monsters of the wood Die in the blameless warfare: closed within The still-contracting circle, their brute force Wasting in mutual rage, they perish there, Or by each other's fury lacerate, The archer's barbed arrow, or the lance Of some bold youth of his first exploits vain, Rajah or Omrah, in the war of beasts Venturous, and learning thus the love of blood. Shouts of alarm ring now along the wall, For now the French their scaling ladders place, And bearing high their bucklers, to the assault Mount fearless: from above the furious troops Fling down such weapons as inventive care Or frantic rage supplies: huge stones and beams Crush the assailants; some, thrust from the height, Fall living to their death; tormented some And writhing wildly as the liquid lead Consumes their flesh, leap desperately down, To end their pain by death. Still others mount, And by their fellows' fate unterrified, Still dare the perilous way. Nor dangerless To the English was the fight, though where they stood The vantage-place was theirs; for them amidst Fast fled the arrows there; and brass-wing'd darts, There driven resistless from the espringal, Keeping their impulse even in the wound, Whirl as they pierce the victim. Some fall crush'd Beneath the ponderous fragment that descends The heavier from its height: some the long lance, Whizzing impetuous on its viewless way, Transfix'd. The cannon ever and anon With thunder rent the air; conflicting shouts And war-cries French and English rung around, And Saints and Devils were invoked in prayers And execrations, Heaven and Hell adjured. Conrade, meantime, who stood upon the bridge, With many a well-aim'd javelin dealing death, Made way upon the rampart and advanced With wary valour o'er his slaughter'd foes. Two youths, the boldest of the English host, Essay'd to thrust him from that perilous height; At once they press'd upon him: he, his axe Dropping, the dagger drew: one through the throat He pierced, and swinging his broad buckler round, Struck down his comrade. Even thus unmoved, Stood Corineus, the sire of Guendolen, When grappling with his monstrous enemy He the brute vastness held aloft, and bore, And headlong hurl'd, all shatter'd to the sea, Down from the rock's high summit, since that day Him, hugest of the giants, chronicling, Called Langoemagog. Behold the Maid Bounds o'er the bridge, and to the wind displays Her hallowed banner. At that welcome sight A general shout of acclamation rose, And loud, as when the tempest-tossing forest Roars to the roaring wind. Then terror seized The garrison; and fired anew with hope, The fierce assailants to their prize rush on Resistless. Vainly do their English foes Hurl there their beams, and stones, and javelins, And fire-brands; fearless in the escalade, The assailants mount, and now upon the wall Wage equal battle. Burning at the sight With indignation, Glacidas beheld His troops fly scatter'd; fast on every side The foe up-rushing eager to their spoil; The holy standard waving; and the Maid Fierce in pursuit. “Speed but this arrow, Heaven!” The chief exclaim'd, “and I shall fall content.” So saying, he his sharpest quarrel chose, And fix'd the bow-string, and against the Maid Levelling, let loose: her arm was raised on high To smite a fugitive; he glanced aside, Shunning her deadly stroke, and thus received The chieftain's arrow: through his ribs it pass'd, And cleft that vessel whence the purer blood Through many a branching channel o'er the frame Meanders. “Fool!” the exasperate knight exclaim'd, “Would she had slain thee! thou hast lived toolong.” Again he aim'd his arbalist: the string Struck forceful: swift the erring arrow sped Guiltless of blood, for lightly o'er the court Bounded the warrior Virgin. Glacidas Levell'd his bow again; the fated shaft Fled true, and difficultly through the mail Pierced to her neck, and tinged its point with blood. “She bleeds! she bleeds!” exulting cried the chief; “The sorceress bleeds! nor all her hellish arts Can charm my arrows from their destin'd course.” Ill-fated man! in vain with eager hand Placing thy feather'd quarrel in its groove, Dream'st thou of Joan subdued! She from her neck Plucking the shaft unterrified, exclaim'd, “This is a favour! Frenchmen, let us on! Escape they cannot from the hand of God!” But Conrade, rolling round his angry eyes, Beheld the English chieftain as he arm'd Again the bow: with rapid step he strode; And Glacidas perceiving his approach, At him the quarrel turn'd, which vainly sent, Fell blunted from his buckler. Conrade came And lifting high the deadly battle-axe, Through pouldron and through shoulder deeply driven Buried it in his bosom: prone he fell, The cold air rush'd upon his heaving heart. One whose low lineage gave no second name Was Glacidas, a gallant man, and still His memory in the records of the foe Survives. And now dishearten'd at his fall The vanquish'd English fly towards the gate, Seeking the inner court, as yet in hope To abide a second siege, and with their friends Find present refuge there. Mistaken men! The vanquish'd have no friends! defeated thus, Press'd by pursuit, in vain with eager voice They call their comrades in the suppliant tones Of pity now, now with the bitter curse Of fruitless anger; they indeed within Fast from the ramparts cast upon the French Beams, stones, and javelins, . . but the gate is barr'd, The huge portcullis down! Then terror seized Their hopeless hearts: some, furious in despair, Turn on their foes; fear-palsied some await The coming death; some drop the useless sword, And cry for mercy. Then the Maid of Arc Took pity on the vanquish'd; and she call'd Aloud, and cried unto the host of France, And bade them cease from slaughter. They obey'd The delegated Damsel. Some there were Apart who communed murmuring, and of those Graville address'd her: “Prophetess! our troops Are few in number; and to well secure These many prisoners such a force demands, As should we spare might shortly make us need The mercy we bestow; not mercy then, Rather to these our soldiers, cruelty. Justice to them, to France, and to our king, And that regard wise nature hath in each Implanted of self-safety, all demand Their deaths.” “Foul fall such evil policy!” The indignant Maid exclaim'd. “I tell thee, chief, God is with us! but God shall hide his face From them, short-sighted they, as hard of heart, Who disregarding all that mitigates, All that ennobles dreadful war, shed blood Like water; who in the deceitful scales Of worldly wisdom, dare to counterpoise The right with the expedient, and resolve Without compunction, as the beam inclines Held in a faultering or a faithless hand. These men shall live to see their homes again, Some to be welcomed there with tears of joy By those who to the latest hour of life Will in their grateful prayers remember us. And when that hour shall come to us, that comes To all, how gladly should we then exchange Renown however splendid, for the thought That we have saved one victim from the sword, . . If only one, . . who begs for us from Heaven That mercy which to others we have shown!” Turning to Conrade, then she said, “Do thou Appoint an escort for the prisoners. Thou need'st not be reminded they are men, Rather by fortune, or by fate, than choice, Brought hither from their homes to work our bale, And for their own not less; but yielded thus Whom we must neither treat as enemies Nor trust as friends, but in safe keeping hold, Both for their own security and ours.” She said: when Conrade cast his eyes around, And saw from man to man where Francis ran, Bidding them spare the vanquish'd; him he hail'd. “The Maid hath bade me chuse a leader forth To guard the prisoners; thou shalt be the man; For thou wilt guard them with due diligence, Yet not forgetful of humanity.” Meantime the garrison of that strong-hold, Who lest the French should enter, had exposed Their comrades to the sword, sustain'd the siege In desperate valour. Fast against the walls The battering-ram was driven; the mangonels Plied at the ramparts fast; the catapults Drove there their dreadful darts; the war-wolfs there Hurl'd their huge stones; and, through the kindled sky, The engines shower'd their sheets of liquid fire. “Feel ye not, comrades, how the ramparts shake?” Exclaim'd a daring Englishman. “Our foes In woman-like compassion, have dismiss'd A powerful escort, weakening thus themselves, And giving us fair hope, in equal field, Of better fortune. Sorely here annoy'd, And slaughter'd by their engines from afar, We perish. Vainly may the soldier boast Undaunted courage and the arm of strength, If thus pent up, like some wild beast he falls, Mark'd for the hunter's arrows. Let us out And meet them in the battle, man to man, Either to conquer, or at least to die A soldier's death.” “Nay, nay.. not so,” replied One of less hopeful courage. “Though they point Their engines here, our archers not in vain Discharge their quarrels. Let the walls and works Still be defended; it will then be time To meet them in the battle man to man, When these shall fail us.” Scarcely had he said, When a huge stone, thrown from some petrary Smote him upon the breast, and with dismay Fill'd all around; for as it shattered him, His blood besprinkled them, and they beheld His mangled lungs lie quivering. “Such the fate Of those who trust them to their walls' defence!” Again exclaim'd the soldier: “Thus they fall, Betray'd by their own fears. Courage alone Can save us.” Nor to draw them from the fort Now needed eloquence; with one accord They bade him lead the onset. Forth they rush'd Impetuous. With such fury o'er the plain, Swoln by the autumnal tempest, Vega rolls His rapid waters, when the gathered storm, On the black heights of Hatteril bursting, swells The tide of desolation. Then the Maid Spake to the son of Orleans, “Let our troops Fall back, so shall the English in pursuit Leave this strong fortress, thus an easy prey.” Time was not for long counsel. From the court, Obedient to Dunois, the French retire As if at the irruption of their foes Dishearten'd; they, with shouts and loud uproar, Haste to their fancied conquest: Joan, the while Placing a small but gallant garrison, Bade them secure the gates; then sallying forth, With such fierce onset charged them in the rear, That terror smote the English, and they wish'd Again that they might hide them in their walls Rashly abandoned, for now wheeling round Dunois attack'd their flank. All captainless, Ill-marshall'd, ill-directed, in vain rage They waste their furious efforts, falling fast Before the Maid's good falchion and the arm Of Conrade: loud was heard the mingled sound Of arms and men; the soil, that trampled late By multitudes, sent up its stifling clouds Of dust, was miry now with human blood. On the fort's summit Talbot mark'd the fight, And calling for his arms impatiently, Eager to issue forth, was scarce withheld, For now, dishearten'd and discomfited, The troops took flight. Upon the bridge there stood A strong-built tower, commanding o'er the Loire. The traveller sometimes linger'd on his way, Marking the playful tenants of the stream, Seen in its shadow, stem the sea-ward tide; This had the invaders won in hard assault, Before the delegate of Heaven came forth And made them fear who never fear'd till then. Thither the English troops with hasty steps Retired, not utterly defeated yet, But mindful of defence: the garrison Them thus retreating saw, and open threw Their guarded gates, and on the Gallic host, Covering their vanquish'd fellows, pour'd their shafts. Check'd in pursuit they stop. Then Graville cried, “Ill, Maiden, hast thou done! those valiant troops Thy womanish pity has dismiss'd, with us Conjoin'd might press upon the vanquish'd foe, Though aided thus, and plant the lilied flag Victorious on yon tower.” “Dark-minded man!” The Maid of Orleans answer'd, “to act well Brings with itself an ample recompence. I have not rear'd the Oriflamme of death.. Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord Is this, and come what will, me it behoves, Mindful of Him whose minister I am, To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God Sends me a messenger of mercy forth, Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France, To England friendly as to all the world, Only to those an enemy, whose lust Of sway makes them the enemies of man.” She said, and suddenly threw off her helm; Her bosom heaved, . . her cheek grew red, . . her eyes Beam'd with a wilder lustre. “Thou dost deem That I have illy spared so large a band, Disabling from pursuit our weaken'd troops; . . God is with us!” she cried.. “God is with us! Our champion manifest!” Even as she spake, The tower, the bridge, and all its multitudes, Sunk with a mighty crash. Astonishment Seized on the French; an universal cry Of terror burst from them. Crush'd in the fall, Or by their armour hopelessly weigh'd down, Or while they plied their unencumber'd arms, Caught by some sinking wretch, who grasp'd them fast, Shrieking they sunk, while frequent fragments huge Fell in the foaming current. From the fort Talbot beheld, and gnash'd his teeth, and cursed The more than mortal Virgin; whilst the towers Of Orleans echoed to the loud uproar, And all who heard trembled, and cross'd their breasts, And as they hasten'd to the city-walls, Told fearfully their beads. 'Twas now the hour When o'er the plain the fading rays of eve Their sober light effuse; when the lowing herd, Slow as they move to shelter, draw behind Their lengthening shadows; and toward his nest, As heavily he flaps the dewy air, The hoarse rook breathes his melancholy note. “Now then, Dunois, for Orleans!” cried the Maid, “And give we to the flames these monuments Of sorrow and disgrace. The ascending flames Will to the dwellers of yon rescued town Rise with a joyful splendour, while the foe Behold and tremble.” As she spake, they ran To burn the forts; they shower their wild fire there, And high amid the gloom the ascending flames Blaze up; then joyful of their finish'd toil The host retire. Hush'd is the field of fight As the calm'd ocean, when its gentle waves Heave slow and silent, wafting tranquilly The shatter'd fragments of some midnight wreck. THE NINTH BOOK. Far through the shadowy sky the ascending flames Stream'd their fierce torrents, by the gales of night Now curl'd, now flashing their long lightnings up That made the stars seem pale; less frequent now Through the red volumes briefer splendours shot, And blacker waves roll'd o'er the darken'd heaven. Dismay'd amid the forts which yet remain'd The invaders saw, and clamour'd for retreat, Deeming that aided by invisible powers The Maid went forth to conquer. Not a sound Moved on the air but fill'd them with vague dread Of unseen dangers; if a sudden blast Arose, through every fibre a deep fear Crept shivering, and to their expecting minds Silence itself was dreadful. One there was Who, learning wisdom in the hour of ill, Exclaim'd, “I marvel not that the Most High Hath hid his face from England! Wherefore thus Quitting the comforts of domestic life, Came we to desolate this goodly land. Making the drench'd earth rank with human blood, Scatter pollution on the winds of Heaven? Oh! that the sepulchre had closed its jaws On the proud prelate, that blood-guilty man, Who, trembling for the church's ill-got wealth, Bade our Fifth Henry claim the crown of France! Oh! that the grave had swallow'd him, ere he Stirr'd up the sleeping claim, and sent him forth To slaughter! Sure that holy hermit spake The Almighty's bidding, who in his career Of conquest met the King, and bade him cease The work of death, before the wrath divine Fell heavy on his head... Full soon it fell And sunk him to the grave; . . and soon that wrath On us, alike in guilt, alike shall fall; For thousands and ten thousands, by the sword Cut off, and sent before the Eternal Judge, With all their unrepented crimes upon them, Cry out for vengeance; for the widow's groan, Though here she groan unpitied or unheard, Is heard in heaven against us; o'er this land For hills of human slain, unsepulchred, Steam pestilence, and cloud the blessed sun! The wrath of God is on us, . . God hath raised This Prophetess, and goes before her path; . . Our brethren, vainly valiant, fall beneath them, Clogging with gore their weapons, or in the flood Whelm'd like the Egyptian tyrant's impious host, Mangled and swoln, their blacken'd carcasses Float on the tainted current! We remain, For yet our rulers will pursue the war, We still remain to perish by the sword, Soon to appear before the throne of God, Conscious, too late, of folly and of guilt, Uninjured, unprovoked, who dared to risk The life His goodness gave us, on the chance Of war, and in obedience to our chiefs Durst disobey our God.” Then terror seized The troops and late repentance; and they thought The spirits of the mothers and their babes Famish'd at Roan sat on the clouds of night, Circling the forts, to hail with gloomy joy The hour of vengeance. Nor the English chiefs Heard these loud murmurs heedless; counselling They met despondent. Suffolk, now their chief, Since Salisbury fell, began. “It now were vain Lightly of this our more than mortal foe To speak contemptuous. She hath vanquish'd us, Aided by Hell's leagued powers, nor aught avails Man unassisted 'gainst Infernal powers To dare the conflict. Were it best remain Waiting the doubtful aid of Burgundy, Doubtful and still delay'd? or from this place, Scene of our shame, retreating as we may, Yet struggle to preserve the guarded towns Of the Orleannois?” He ceased, and with a sigh, Struggling with pride that heaved his gloomy breast, Talbot replied, “Our council little boots; For by their numbers now made bold in fear The soldiers will not fight, they will not heed Our vain resolves, heart-wither'd by the spells Of this accursed sorceress. Soon will come The expected host from England; even now Perchance the tall bark scuds across the deep That bears my son: young Talbot comes, . . he comes To find his sire disgraced! But soon mine arm, By vengeance nerved, and shame of such defeat, Shall from the crest-fall'n courage of yon witch, Regain its ancient glory. Near the coast Best is it to retreat, and there expect The coming succour.” Thus the warrior spake. Joy ran through all the troops, as though retreat Were safety. Silently in order'd ranks They issue forth, favour'd by the thick clouds Which mantled o'er the moon. With throbbing hearts Fearful they speeded on; some in sad thoughts Of distant England, and now wise too late, Cursing in bitterness the evil hour That led them from her shores; some in faint hope Thinking to see their native land again; Talbot went musing on his former fame, Sullen and stern, and feeding on dark thoughts, And meditating vengeance. In the walls Of Orleans, though her habitants with joy Humbly acknowledged the high aid of Heaven, Of many a heavy ill and bitter loss Mindful, such mingled sentiments they felt As one from shipwreck saved, the first warm glow Of transport past, who contemplates himself Preserved alone, a solitary wretch, Possess'd of life indeed, but reft of all That makes man love to live. The chieftains shared The social bowl, glad of the town relieved, And communing of that miraculous Maid, Who came the saviour of the realm of France, When vanquish'd in the frequent field of shame Her bravest warriors trembled. Joan the while Fasting and silent to the convent pass'd, Conrade with her, and Isabel; both mute, Yet gazing on her oft with anxious eyes, Looking the consolation that they fear'd To give a voice to. Now they reach'd the dome: The glaring torches o'er the house of death Stream'd a sad splendour. Flowers and funeral herbs Bedeck'd the bier of Theodore, . . the rue, The dark green rosemary, and the violet, That pluck'd like him wither'd in its first bloom. Dissolved in sorrow, Isabel her grief Pour'd copiously, and Conrade also wept: Joan only shed no tears, from her fix'd eye Intelligence was absent, and she seem'd, Though listening to the dirge of death, to hear And comprehend it not, till in the grave, . . In his last home, . . now Theodore was laid, And earth to earth upon the coffin thrown; Then the Maid started at that mortal sound, And her lip quiver'd, and on Isabel, Trembling and faint, she leant, and pale as death. Then in the priest arose an earnest hope, That weary of the world and sick with woe, The Maid might dwell with them a virgin vow'd. “Ah, damsel!” slow he spake, and cross'd his breast, “Ah, damsel! favour'd as thou art of heaven, Let not thy soul beneath its sorrow sink Despondent; Heaven by sorrow disciplines The froward heart, and chastens whom it loves. Therefore, companion of thy way of life, Shall sorrow wean thee from this faithless world, Where happiness provokes the traveller's chase, And like the midnight meteor of the marsh Allures his long and perilous pursuit, Then leaves him dark and comfortless. O Maid! Fix thou thine eyes upon that heavenly dawn Beyond the night of life! Thy race is run, Thou hast deliver'd Orleans: now perfect Thyself, accomplish all, and be the child Of God. Amid these sacred haunts the groan Of woe is never heard; these hallow'd roofs Re-echo only to the pealing quire, The chaunted mass, and virgin's holy hymn, Celestial sounds! Secluded here, the soul Receives a foretaste of her joys to come; This is the abode of piety and peace; Oh! be their inmate, Maiden! Come to rest, Die to the world, and live espoused to Heaven!” Then Conrade answered, “Father! heaven has call'd This Maid to active duties.” “Active!” cried The astonish'd Monk; “thou dost not know the toils This holy warfare asks; thou dost not know How powerful the attacks that Satan makes By sinful Nature aided! Dost thou think It is an easy task from the fond breast To root affection out? to burst the cords Which grapple to society the heart Of social man? to rouse the unwilling spirit, That, rebel to devotion, faintly pours The cold lip-worship of the wearying prayer? To fear and tremble at Him, yet to love A God of Terrors? Maid beloved of Heaven, Come to this sacred trial! share with us The day of penance and the night of prayer! Humble thyself; feel thine own worthlessness, A reptile worm, before thy birth condemn'd To all the horrors of thy Maker's wrath, The lot of fallen mankind! Oh, hither come! Humble thyself in ashes. So thy name Shall live amid the blessed host of saints, And unborn pilgrims at thy hallowed shrine Pour forth their pious offerings.” “Hear me, father!” Exclaim'd the awaken'd Maid. “Amid these tombs, Cold as their clayey tenants, know, my heart Must never grow to stone! Chill thou thyself, And break thy midnight rest, and tell thy beads, And labour through thy still repeated prayer; Fear thou thy God of Terrors; spurn the gifts He gave, and sepulchre thyself alive! But far more valued is the vine that bends Beneath its swelling clusters, than the dark And joyless ivy, round the cloister's wall Wreathing its barren arms. For me I know That I have faithfully obey'd my call, Confiding not in mine own strength, but His Who sent me forth to suffer and to do His will; and in that faith I shall appear Before the just tribunal of that God Whom grateful love has taught me to adore!” Severe she spake, for sorrow in her heart Had wrought unwonted sternness. From the dome They pass'd in silence, when with hasty steps, Sent by the chiefs, a messenger they met, Who, in alarm, the mission'd Virgin sought, A bearer of ill tidings. “Holy Maid!” He said, “they ask thy counsel. Burgundy Comes in the cause of England, and his troops Scarce three leagues from the walls, a fearful power, Rest tented for the night.” “Say to the chiefs, At morn I will be with them,” she replied; “And to this urgency will give meantime My nightly thoughts.” So saying on she went In thoughtful silence. A brief while she mused, Brief, but sufficing to excite her soul, As with a power and impulse not its own, To some great purpose. “Conrade!” then she said, “I pray thee meet me at the eastern gate With a swift steed prepared, . . for I must hence.” Her voice was calm, and Conrade through the gloom Saw not the flush that witness'd on her cheek Inward emotion at some thought conceived. She to her quarters hastily repair'd, There with a light and unplumed casquetel She helm'd her head; hung from her neck the shield, And forth she went. Her Conrade by the gate A waited. “May I, Maiden, ask unblamed Whither this midnight journey? may I share The peril?” cried the warrior. She rejoin'd, “This, Conrade, must not be. Alone I go. That impulse of the soul which comes from God Sends me. But thou of this remain assured, If aught that I must enterprize required Associate firmness, thou shouldst be the man, Best, . . last, . . and only friend!” So up she sprung And left him. He beheld the warden close The gate, and listen'd to her courser's tramp, Till soon upon his ear the far-off sound Fell faintly, and was lost. Swift o'er the vale Sped the good courser; eagerly the Maid Gave the loose rein, and now her speed attain'd The dark encampment. Through the sleeping ranks Onward she past. The trampling of her steed Or mingled with the soldier's busy dreams, Or with vague terrors fill'd his startled sense, Prompting a secret prayer. So on she past To where in loftier shade arose the tent Of Burgundy: light leaping from her seat She enter'd. On the earth the chieftain slept, His mantle scarft around him; near him hung His helmet and his shield, and at his side Within hand-reach his sword. Profound he slept, Nor heard the coming courser's sounding hoof, Nor entering footstep. “Burgundy!” she cried, “What, Burgundy! awake!” He started up And saw the gleam of arms, and to his sword Reach'd a quick hand. But what he now beheld Thrill'd him, for full upon her face the lamp Cast its deep glare, and in her solemn look Was an unearthly meaning. Pale she was; And in her eye a saintly lustre beam'd, And that most calm and holiest confidence That guilt knows never. “Burgundy, thou seest The Maid of Orleans!” As she spake, a voice Exclaim'd, “Die, sorceress!” and a knight rush'd in, Whose name by her illustrated yet lives, Franquet of Arras. With uplifted arm Furious he came; her buckler broke the blow, And forth she flash'd her sword, and with a stroke Swift that no eye could ward it, and of strength No mail might blunt, smote on his neck, his neck Unfenced, for he in haste aroused had cast An armet on; resistless there she smote, And to the earth prone fell the headless trunk Of Franquet. Then on Burgundy she fix'd Her eye severe. “Go, chief, and thank thy God That he with lighter judgements visits thee Than fell on Sisera, or by Judith's hand He wrought upon the Assyrian! Thank thy God, That when his vengeance smote the invading sons Of England, equal though thou wert in guilt, Thee he has spar'd to work by penitence And better deeds atonement.” Thus she spake, Then issued forth, and bounding on her steed Sped o'er the plain. Dark on the upland bank The hedge-row trees distinct and colourless Rose on the grey horizon, and the Loire Form'd in its winding way islands of light Amid the shadowy vale, when now she reach'd The walls of Orleans. From the eastern clouds The sun came forth, as to the assembled chiefs The Maiden pass'd. Her bending thitherwards The Bastard met. “New perils threaten us,” He said, “new toils await us; Burgundy, . . .” “Fear not for Burgundy!” the Maid replied, “Him will the Lord direct. Our earliest scouts Shall tell his homeward march. What of the troops Of England?” “They,” the son of Orleans cried, “By darkness favour'd, fled; yet not by flight Shall these invaders now escape the arm Of retribution. Even now our troops, By battle unfatigued, unsatisfied With conquest, clamour to pursue the foe.” The delegated Damsel thus replied: “So let them fly, Dunois! But other work Than that of battle, now must be perform'd. We move not in pursuit, till we have paid The rites of burial to our countrymen, And hymn'd our gratitude to that All-just Who gave the victory. Thou, meantime, dispatch Tidings to Chinon: let the King set forth, That crowning him before assembled France, In Rheims delivered from the enemy, I may accomplish all.” So said the Maid, Then to the gate moved on. The assembled troops Beheld her coming, and they smote their shields, And with one voice of greeting bless'd her name And pray'd her to pursue the flying foe. She waved her hand, and silently they stood, Attentive while she spake; . . “Fellows in arms! We must not speed to joyful victory, And leave our gallant comrades where they lie, For dogs, and wolves, and carrion-birds a prey; Ere we advance, let us discharge to them The duty that is due.” So said the Maid; And as she spake, the thirst of battles dies In every breast, such awe and love pervade The listening troops. They o'er the corse-strewn plain Speed to their sad employment: some dig deep The house of death; some bear the lifeless load; Others the while search carefully around, If haply they may find surviving yet Some wounded wretches. As they labour thus, They mark far off the iron-blaze of arms; See distant standards waving on the air, And hear the clarion's clang. Then spake the Maid To Conrade, and she bade him haste to espy The coming army; or to meet their march With friendly greeting, or if foes they came With such array of battle as short space Allow'd: the warrior sped across the plain, And soon beheld the banner'd lilies wave. Their chief was Richemont: he when as he heard What rites employed the Virgin, straightway bade His troops assist in burial; they, though grieved At late arrival, and the expected day Of conquest past, yet give their willing aid: They dig the general grave, and thither bear English or French alike commingled now, And heap the mound of death. Amid the plain There was a little eminence, of old Raised o'er some honoured chieftain's narrow house. His praise the song had ceased to celebrate, And many an unknown age had the long grass Waved o'er that nameless mound, though barren now Beneath the frequent tread of multitudes. There elevate, the martial Maiden stood, Her brow unhelm'd, and floating on the wind Her long dark locks. The silent troops around Stood thickly throng'd, as o'er the fertile field Billows the ripen'd corn. The passing breeze Bore not a murmur from the numerous host, Such deep attention held them. She began. “Glory to those who in their country's cause Fall in the field of battle! Countrymen, I stand not here to mourn these gallant men, Our comrades, nor with vain and idle phrase Of sorrow and compassion, to console The friends who loved them. They indeed who fall Beneath oppression's banner, merit well Our pity; may the God of Peace and Love Be merciful to those blood-guilty men Who came to desolate the realm of France, To make us bow the knee, and crouch like slaves Before a foreign master. Give to these, And to their wives and orphan little-ones That on their distant father vainly cry For bread, give these your pity! . . . Wretched men, Forced or inveigled from their homes, or driven By need and hunger to the trade of blood; Or, if with free and willing mind they came, Most wretched, . . for before the eternal throne Guilty alike in act and will, they stand. But our dead comrades for their country fought; No arts they needed, nor the specious bribes Of promise, to allure them to this fight, This holy warfare! them their parents sent, And as they raised their streaming eyes to Heaven, Bade them go forth, and from the ruffian's sword Save their grey hairs: them their dear wives sent out, Fix'd their last kisses on their armed hands, And bade them in the battle think they fought For them and for their children. Thus inflamed, By every milder feeling, they went forth, They fought, they conquer'd. To this holy ground The men of Orleans in the days to come Shall bring their boys, and tell them of the deeds Their countrymen achieved, and bid them learn Like them to love their country, and like them, Should usurpation pour again its tide Of desolation, to step forth and stem Fearless, the furious torrent. Men of France, Mourn not for these our comrades! boldly they Fought the good fight, and that Eternal One, Who bade the Angels harbinger his Word With ‘Peace on earth,’ rewards them. We survive, Honouring their memories to avenge their fall Upon the unjust invaders. They may drain Their kingdom's wealth and lavishly expend Its blood, insanely thinking to subdue This wide and populous realm; for easier were it To move the ancient mountains from their base, Than on a nation knowing its own strength To force a foreign yoke. France then is safe. My glorious mission soon will be fulfill'd, My work be done. But oh! remember ye, And in their generation let your sons Transmit to theirs the all-concerning truth, That a great people, wrongfully assail'd, If faithful to themselves, and resolute In duty to the last, betide what may, . . . Although no signs be given, no miracles Vouchsafed as now, no Prophetess ordain'd, May yet with hope invincible hold on, Relying on their courage, and their cause, And the sure course of righteous Providence. THE TENTH BOOK. Thus to the martyrs in their country's cause The Maiden gave their fame; and when she ceased, Such murmur from the multitude arose, As when at twilight hour the summer breeze Moves o'er the elmy vale. There was not one Who mourn'd with feeble sorrow for his friend, Slain in the fight of freedom; or if chance Remembrance with a tear suffused the eye, The patriot's joy shone through. And now the rites Of sepulture perform'd, the hymn to Heaven They chaunted. To the town the Maid return'd, Dunois, with her, and Richemont, and the man Conrade, whose converse most the Virgin loved. They of pursuit and of the future war Sat communing; when loud the trumpet's voice Proclaim'd a herald's coming. “To the Maid,” Such was his errand, “and to thee, Dunois, Son of the chief he loved, Du Chastel sends Greeting. The aged warrior hath not spared All active efforts to partake your toil, And serve his country; and though late arrived, He share not in the fame your arms acquire His heart is glad that he is late arrived, And France preserved thus early. He were here To join your host, and follow the pursuit, But Richemont is his foe. To that high Lord Thus says my master: We, though each to each Be hostile, are alike the embattled sons Of our dear country. Therefore do thou join The conquering troops, and prosecute success; I will the while assault what guarded towns Bedford yet holds in Orleannois: one day, Perhaps the Constable of France may learn He wrong'd Du Chastel.” As the herald spake, Richemont's cheek redden'd, partly with a sense Of shame, and partly anger half supprest. “Say to thy master,” eagerly he said, “I am the foe of those court parasites Who poison the King's ear. Him who shall serve Our country in the field, I hold my friend: Such may Du Chastel prove.” So said the chief, And pausing as the herald went his way, Turn'd to the Virgin: “If I guess aright, It is not from a friendly tongue's report, That thou hast heard of me.” Dissembling not The unwelcome truth, “Yes, chieftain!” she replied, “Report bespeaks thee haughty, violent, Suffering no rival, brooking no controul, And executing by unrighteous means The judgments of thine own unlawful will.” “But hear me, Maid of Orleans!” he exclaim'd: “Should the wolf enter thy defenceless flock, Were it a crime if thy more mighty force Destroy'd the fell destroyer? If thy hand Had slain a ruffian as he burst thy door Prepared for midnight murder, should'st thou feel The weight of blood press heavy on thy soul? I slew the wolves of state, the murderers Of thousands. Joan! when rusted in its sheath The sword of justice hung, blamest thou the man That lent his weapon for the righteous deed?” Conrade replied, “Nay, Richemont, it were well To slay the ruffian as he burst thy doors; But if he bear the plunder safely thence, And thou should'st meet him on the future day, Vengeance must not be thine: there is the law To punish; and the law alloweth not, That the accuser take upon himself The judge's part; still less doth it allow That he should execute upon the accused Untried, unheard, a sentence, which so given Becomes, whate'er the case, itself a crime.” “Thou hast said wisely,” cried the constable; “But there are guilty ones above the law, Men whose black crimes exceed the utmost bound Of private guilt; court vermin that buzz round, And fly-blow the King's ear, and make him waste, In this most perilous time, his people's wealth And blood; immersed one while in sensual sloth, Heedless though ruin threat the realm they rule; And now projecting some mad enterprize, Sending their troops to sure defeat and shame. These are the men who make the King suspect His wisest, faithfullest, best counsellors; And for themselves and their dependents, seize All places, and all profits; and they wrest To their own ends the statutes of the land, Or safely break them; thus, or indolent, Or active, rumous alike to France. Wisely thou sayest, warrior, that the Law Should strike the guilty; but the voice of Justice Cries out, and brings conviction as it cries, Whom the laws cannot reach, the dagger should.” The Maid replied, “It seemeth then, O chief, That reasoning to thine own conviction thus, Thou standest self-acquitted of all wrong, Self-justified, yea, self-approved. I ask not Whether this public zeal hath look'd askaunt To private ends; men easily deceive Others, and oft more easily themselves. But what if one reasoning as thou hast done Had in like course proceeded to the act, One of the people, one of low degree, In whom the strong desire of public good Had grown to be his one sole sleepless thought, A passion, and a madness; raised as high Above all sordid motives as thyself; Beneath such impulses of rivalry And such ambitious projects, as perforce Men will impute to thee? had such a man Stood forth the self-appointed minister To execute his own decrees of death, The law on him had rightfully enforced That sentence, which the Almighty hath enjoin'd Of life for life. Thou, chief, art by thy rank And power exempted from the penalty: What then hast thou exampled, . . right and wrong Confounding thus, and making lawless might The judge in its own quarrel? Trust me, chief, That if a people sorely are oppress'd, The dreadful hour of overthrow will come Too surely and too soon! He best meanwhile Performs the sage's and the patriot's part, Who in the ear of rage and faction breathes The healing words of love.” Thus communed they. Meantime, all panic-struck and terrified, The English urge their flight; by other thoughts Possess'd than when, elate with arrogance, They dreamt of conquest, and the crown of France At their disposal. Of their hard-fought fields, Of glory hardly-earn'd, and lost with shame, Of friends and brethren slaughter'd, and the fate Threatening themselves, they brooded sadly, now Repentant late and vainly. They whom fear Erst made obedient to their conquering march, Rise on them in defeat, while they retire, Marking their path with ruin, day by day Leaving the weak and wounded destitute To the foe's mercy; thinking of their home, Though to that far-off prospect scarcely hope Could raise a sickly eye. Oh then what joy Inspired anew their bosoms, when, like clouds Moving in shadows down the distant hill, They saw their coming succours! In each heart Doubt raised a busy tumult; soon they knew The English standard, and a general shout Burst from the joyful ranks: yet came no joy To Talbot: he, with dark and downward brow, Mused sternly, till at length aroused to hope Of vengeance, welcoming his gallant son, He brake a sullen smile. “Son of my age, Welcome young Talbot to thy first of fields. Thy father bids thee welcome, though disgraced, Baffled, and flying from a woman's arm! Yes, by my former glories, from a woman! The scourge of France, the conqueror of men, Flying before a woman! Son of Talbot, Had the winds wafted thee a few days sooner, Thou hadst seen me high in honour, and thy name Alone had scatter'd armies; yet, my son, I bid thee welcome! here we rest our flight, And face again the foe.” So spake the chief; And well he counsell'd: for not yet the sun Had reach'd meridian height, when o'er the plain Of Patay, they beheld the troops of France Speed in pursuit. Soon as the troops of France Beheld the dark battalions of the foe Shadowing the distant plain, a general shout Burst from the expectant host, and on they prest, Elate of heart and eager for the fight, With clamours ominous of victory. Thus urging on, one from the adverse host Advanced to meet them: they his garb of peace Knew, and they halted as the herald spake His bidding to the chieftains. “Sirs!” he cried, “I bear defiance to you from the Earl William of Suffolk. Here on this fit ground, He wills to give you battle, power to power, So please you, on the morrow.” “On the morrow We will join battle then,” replied Dunois, “And God befriend the right!” Then on the herald A robe rich-furr'd and broider'd he bestow'd, A costly guerdon. Through the army spread The unwelcome tidings of delay; possess'd With agitating hopes they felt the hours Pass heavily; but soon the night wain'd on, And the loud trumpets' blare from broken sleep Roused them; a second time the thrilling blast Bade them be arm'd, and at the third long sound They ranged them in their ranks. From man to man With pious haste hurried the confessors To shrive them, lest with souls all unprepared They to their death might go. Dunois meantime Rode through the host, the shield of dignity Before him borne, and in his hand he held The white wand of command. The open helm Disclosed that eye which temper'd the strong lines Of steady valour, to obedient awe Winning the will's assent. To some he spake Of late-earn'd glory; others, new to war, He bade bethink them of the feats achieved When Talbot, recreant to his former fame, Fled from beleaguer'd Orleans. Was there one Whom he had known in battle? by the hand Him did he take, and bid him on that day Summon his wonted courage, and once more Support his chief and comrade. Happy he Who caught his eye, or from the chieftain's lips Heard his own name! joy more inspiriting Fills not the Persian's soul, when sure he deems That Mithra hears propitiously his prayer, And o'er the scattered cloud of morning pours A brighter ray responsive. Then the host Partook due food, this their last meal belike Receiving with such thoughtful doubts as make The soul, impatient of uncertainty, Rush eager to the event; being thus prepared, Upon the grass the soldiers laid themselves, Each in his station, waiting there the sound Of onset, that in undiminish'd strength Strong, they might meet the battle; silent some Pondering the chances of the coming day, Some whiling with a careless gaiety The fearful pause of action. Thus the French In such array and high in confident hope A wait the signal; whilst with other thoughts, And ominous awe, once more the invading host Prepare them in the field of fight to meet The Prophetess. Collected in himself Appear'd the might of Talbot. Through the ranks He stalks, reminds them of their former fame, Their native land, their homes, the friends they loved, All the rewards of this day's victory. But awe had fill'd the English, and they struck Faintly their shields; for they who had beheld The hallowed banner with celestial light Irradiate, and the mission'd Maiden's deeds, Felt their hearts sink within them, at the thought Of her near vengeance; and the tale they told Roused such a tumult in the new-come troops, As fitted them for fear. The aged Earl Beheld their drooping valour, and his brow, Wrinkled with thought, bewray'd his inward doubts: Still he was firm, though all might fly, resolved That Talbot should retrieve his old renown, And end his life with glory. Yet some hope Inspired the veteran, as across the plain Casting his eye, he mark'd the embattled strength Of thousands; archers of unequalled skill, Brigans and pikemen, from whose lifted points A fearful radiance flash'd, and young esquires, And high-born warriors, bright in blazon'd arms. Nor few, nor fameless were the English chiefs. In many a field victorious, he was there, The garter'd Fastolffe; Hungerford, and Scales, Men who had seen the hostile squadrons fly Before the arms of England; Suffolk there, The haughty chieftain tower'd; blest had he fallen Ere yet a courtly minion he was mark'd By public hatred, and the murderer's guilt! There too the son of Talbot, young in arms, Heir of a noble race and mighty name: At many a tilt and tournament had he Approved his skill and prowess; confident In strength, and jealous of his future fame, His heart beat high for battle. Such array Of marshall'd numbers fought not on the field Of Cressy, nor at Poictiers; nor such force Led Henry to the fight of Agincourt When thousands fell before him. Onward move The host of France. It was a goodly sight To see the embattled pomp, as with the step Of stateliness the barded steeds came on, . . To see the pennons rolling their long waves Before the gale, and banners broad and bright Tossing their blazonry, and high-plumed chiefs Vidames and Seneschalls and Chastellains, Gay with their bucklers' gorgeous heraldry, And silken surcoats to the mid-day sun Glittering. And now the knights of France dismount, For not to brutal strength they deem'd it right To trust their fame and their dear country's weal; Rather to manly courage, and the glow Of honourable thoughts, such as inspire Ennobling energy. Unhorsed, unspurr'd, Their javelins shorten'd to a wieldy length, They to the foe advanced. The Maid alone, Conspicuous on a coal-black courser, meets The war. They moved to battle with such sound As rushes o'er the vaulted firmament, When from his seat, on the utmost verge of heaven That overhangs the void, the Sire of Winds, Hræsvelger starting, rears his giant bulk, And from his eagle pinions shakes the storm. High on her stately steed the martial Maid Rode foremost of the war; her burnish'd arms Shone like the brook that o'er its pebbled course Runs glittering gayly to the noon-tide sun. The foaming courser, of her guiding hand Impatient, smote the earth, and toss'd his mane, And rear'd aloft with many a froward bound, Then answered to the rein with such a step, As, in submission, he were proud to show His spirit unsubdued. Slow on the air Waved the white plumes that shadow'd o'er her helm. Even such, so fair, so terrible in arms, Pelides moved from Scyros, where, conceal'd, He lay obedient to his mother's fears A seemly damsel; thus the youth appear'd Terribly graceful, when upon his neck Deidameia hung, and with a look That spake the tumult of her troubled soul, Fear, anguish, and upbraiding tenderness, Gazed on the father of her unborn babe. An English knight, who eager for renown Late left his peaceful mansion, mark'd the Maid. Her power miraculous and portentous deeds He from the troops had heard incredulous, And scoff'd their easy fears, and vow'd that he, Proving the magic of this dreaded girl In equal battle, would dissolve the spell, Powerless opposed to valor. Forth he spurr'd Before the ranks; she mark'd the coming foe, And fix'd her lance in rest, and rush'd along. Midway they met; full on her buckler driven, Shiver'd the English spear: her better force Drove the brave foeman senseless from his seat. Headlong he fell, nor ever to the sense Of shame awoke, for crowding multitudes Soon crush'd the helpless warrior. Then the Maid Rode through the thickest battle; fast they fell, Pierced by her forceful spear. Amid the troops Plunged her strong war-horse, by the noise of arms Elate and roused to rage, he tramples o'er, Or with the lance protended from his front, Thrusts down the thronging squadrons. Where she turns The foe tremble and die. Such ominous fear Seizes the traveller o'er the trackless sands, Who marks the dread Simoom across the waste Sweep its swift pestilence: to earth he falls, Nor dares give utterance to the inward prayer, Deeming the Genius of the desart breathes The purple blast of death. Such was the sound As when a tempest, mingling air and sea, Flies o'er the uptorn ocean: dashing high Their foamy heads amid the incumbent clouds, The madden'd billows with their deafening roar Drown the loud thunder's peal. In every form Of horror, death was there. They fall, transfix'd By the random arrow's point, or fierce-thrust lance, Or sink, all battered by the ponderous mace: Some from their coursers thrown, lie on the earth, Helpless because of arms, that weak to save, Lengthened the lingering agonies of death. But most the English fell, by their own fears Betray'd, for fear the evil that it dreads Increaseth. Even the chiefs, who many a day Had met the war and conquer'd, trembled now, Appall'd before the Maid miraculous. As the blood-nurtur'd monarch of the wood, That o'er the wilds of Afric in his strength Resistless ranges, when the mutinous clouds Burst, and the lightnings through the midnight sky Dart their red fires, lies fearful in his den, And howls in terror to the passing storm. But Talbot, fearless where the bravest fear'd Mow'd down the hostile ranks. The chieftain stood Like a strong oak, amid the tempest's rage, That stands unharm'd, and while the forest falls Uprooted round, lifts his high head aloft, And nods majestic to the warring wind. He fought, resolved to snatch the shield of death And shelter him from shame. The very herd Who fought near Talbot, though the Virgin's name Made their cheeks pale and drove the curdling blood Back to their hearts, caught from his daring deeds New force, and went like eaglets to the prey Beneath their mother's wing: to him they look'd, Their tower of strength, and follow'd where his sword Made through the foe a way. Nor did the son Of Talbot shame his lineage; by his sire Emulous he strove, like the young lionet When first he bathes his murderous jaws in blood. They fought intrepid, though amid their ranks Fear and confusion triumph'd; for such dread Possess'd the English, as the Etruscans felt, When self-devoted to the infernal gods The aweful Decius stood before the troops, Robed in the victim garb of sacrifice, And spake aloud, and call'd the shadowy powers To give to Rome the conquest, and receive Their willing prey; then rush'd amid the foe, And died upon the hecatombs he slew. But hope inspired the assailants. Xaintrailles there Spread fear and death, and Orleans' valiant son Fought as when Warwick fled before his arm. O'er all pre-eminent for hardiest deeds Was Conrade. Where he drove his battle-axe, Weak was the buckler or the helm's defence, Hauberk, or plated mail, through all it pierced, Resistless as the fork'd flash of heaven. The death-doom'd foe, who mark'd the coming chief, Felt such a chill run through his shivering frame, As the night-traveller of the Pyrenees, Lone and bewilder'd on his wintery way, When from the mountains round reverberates The hungry wolves' deep yell: on every side, Their fierce eyes gleaming as with meteor fires, The famish'd pack come round; the affrighted mule Snorts loud with terror, on his shuddering limbs The big sweat starts, convulsive pant his sides, Then on he gallops, wild in desperate speed. Him dealing death an English knight beheld, And spurr'd his steed to crush him: Conrade leap'd Lightly aside, and through the warrior's grieves Fix'd a deep wound: nor longer could the foe, Disabled thus, command his mettled horse, Or his rude plunge endure; headlong he fell, And perish'd. In his castle-hall was hung On high his father's shield, with many a dint Graced on the glorious field of Agincourt. His deeds the son had heard; and when a boy, Listening delighted to the old man's tale, His little hand would lift the weighty spear In warlike pastime: he had left behind An infant offspring, and had fondly deem'd He too in age the exploits of his youth Should tell, and in the stripling's bosom rouse The fire of glory. Conrade the next foe Smote where the heaving membrane separates The chambers of the trunk. The dying man, In his lord's castle dwelt, for many a year, A well-beloved servant: he could sing Carols for Shrove-tide, or for Candlemas, Songs for the wassel and when the boar's head, Crown'd with gay garlands and with rosemary, Smoked on the Christmas board: he went to war Following the lord he loved, and saw him fall Beneath the arm of Conrade, and expired, Slain on his master's body. Nor the fight Was doubtful long. Fierce on the invading host Press the French troops impetuous, as of old, When pouring o'er his legion slaves on Greece, The eastern despot bridged the Hellespont, The rushing sea against the mighty pile Roll'd its full weight of waters; far away The fearful Satrap mark'd on Asia's coasts The floating fragments, and with ominous fear Trembled for the great king. Still Talbot strove, His foot firm planted, his uplifted shield Fencing that breast which never yet had known The throb of fear. But when the warrior's eye, Glancing around the fight, beheld the French Pressing to conquest, and his heartless troops Striking with feebler force in backward step, Then o'er his cheek he felt the indignant flush Of shame, and loud he lifted up his voice, And cried, “Fly, cravens! leave your aged chief Here in the front to perish! his old limbs Are not like yours so supple in the flight. Go tell your countrymen how ye escaped When Talbot fell!” In vain the warrior spake, In the uproar of the fight his voice was lost; And they, the nearest, who had heard, beheld The Prophetess approach, and every thought Was overwhelm'd in terror. But the son Of Talbot mark'd her thus across the plain Careering fierce in conquest, and the hope Of glory rose within him. Her to meet He spurr'd his horse, by one decisive deed Or to retrieve the battle, or to fall With honour. Each beneath the others' blow Bow'd down; their lances shiver'd with the shock: To earth their coursers fell: at once they rose, He from the saddle bow his falchion caught Rushing to closer combat, and she bared The lightning of her sword. In vain the youth Essay'd to pierce those arms which even the power Of time was weak to injure: she the while Through many a wound beheld her foeman's blood Ooze fast. “Yet save thyself!” the Maiden cried. “Me thou canst not destroy: be timely wise, And live!” He answer'd not, but lifting high His weapon, smote with fierce and forceful arm Full on the Virgin's helm: fire from her eyes Flash'd with the stroke: one step she back recoil'd, Then in his breast plunged deep the sword of death. Talbot beheld his fall; on the next foe, With rage and anguish wild, the warrior turn'd; His ill-directed weapon to the earth Drove down the unwounded Frank: he strikes again And through his all-in-vain imploring hands Cleaves the poor suppliant. On that dreadful day The sword of Talbot, clogg'd with hostile gore, Made good its vaunt. Amid the heaps his arm Had slain, the chieftain stood and sway'd around His furious strokes: nor ceased he from the fight, Though now discomfited the English troops Fled fast, all panic-struck and spiritless, And mingling with the routed, Fastolffe fled, Fastolffe, all fierce and haughty as he was, False to his former fame; for he beheld The Maiden rushing onward, and such fear Ran through his frame, as thrills the African, When, grateful solace in the sultry hour, He rises on the buoyant billow's breast, And then beholds the inevitable shark Close on him, open-mouth'd. But Talbot now A moment paused, for bending thitherward He mark'd a warrior, such as well might ask His utmost force. Of strong and stately port The onward foeman moved, and bore on high A battle-axe, in many a field of blood Known by the English chieftain. Over heaps Of slaughter'd, he made way, and bade the troops Retire from the bold earl: then Conrade spake. “Vain is thy valour, Talbot! look around, See where thy squadrons fly! but thou shalt lose No honour, by their cowardice subdued, Performing well thyself the soldier's part.” “And let them fly!” the indignant Earl exclaim'd, “And let them fly! and bear thou witness, chief! That guiltless of this day's disgrace, I fall. But, Frenchman! Talbot will not tamely fall, Nor unrevenged.” So saying, for the war He stood prepared: nor now with heedless rage The champions fought, for either knew full well His foeman's prowess: now they aim the blow Insidious, with quick change then drive the steel Fierce on the side exposed. The unfaithful arms Yield to the strong-driven edge; the blood streams down Their batter'd mail. With swift eye Conrade mark'd The lifted buckler, and beneath impell'd His battle-axe; that instant on his helm The sword of Talbot fell, and with the blow It broke. “Yet yield thee, Englishman!” exclaim'd The generous Frank, “vain is this bloody strife: Me should'st thou conquer, little would my death Avail thee, weak and wounded!” “Long enough Talbot has lived,” replied the sullen chief: “His hour is come; yet shalt not thou survive To glory in his fall!” So, as he spake, He lifted from the ground a massy spear, And came again to battle. Now more fierce The conflict raged, for careless of himself, And desperate, Talbot fought. Collected still Was Conrade. Whereso'er his foeman aim'd The well-thrust javelin, there he swung around His guardian shield: the long and vain assault Exhausted Talbot now; foredone with toil He bare his buckler low for weariness, The buckler now splinter'd with many a stroke Fell piecemeal; from his riven arms the blood Stream'd fast: and now the Frenchman's battle-axe Came unresisted on the shieldless mail. But then he held his hand. “Urge not to death This fruitless contest!” he exclaim'd: “Oh chief! Are there not those in England who would feel Keen anguish at thy loss? a wife perchance Who trembles for thy safety, or a child Needing a father's care!” Then Talbot's heart Smote him. “Warrior!” he cried, “if thou dost think That life is worth preserving, hie thee hence, And save thyself: I loathe this useless talk.” So saying, he address'd him to the fight, Impatient of existence: from their arms Fire flash'd, and quick they panted; but not long Endured the deadly combat. With full force Down through his shoulder even to the chest, Conrade impell'd the ponderous battle-axe; And at that instant underneath his shield Received the hostile spear. Prone fell the Earl, Even in his death rejoicing that no foe Should live to boast his fall. Then with faint hand Conrade unlaced his helm, and from his brow Wiping the cold dews ominous of death, He laid him on the earth, thence to remove, While the long lance hung heavy in his side, Powerless. As thus beside his lifeless foe He lay, the herald of the English Earl With faltering step drew near, and when he saw His master's arms, “Alas! and is it you, My lord?” he cried. “God pardon you your sins! I have been forty years your officer, And time it is I should surrender now The ensigns of my office!” So he said, And paying thus his rite of sepulture, Threw o'er the slaughter'd chief his blazon'd coat. Then Conrade thus bespake him: “Englishman, Do for a dying soldier one kind act! Seek for the Maid of Orleans, bid her haste Hither, and thou shalt gain what recompence It pleaseth thee to ask.” The herald soon Meeting the mission'd Virgin, told his tale. Trembling she hasten'd on, and when she knew The death-pale face of Conrade, scarce could Joan Lift up the expiring warrior's heavy hand, And press it to her heart. “I sent for thee, My friend!” with interrupted voice he cried, That I might comfort this my dying hour With one good deed. A fair domain is mine, Let Francis and his Isabel possess That, mine inheritance.” He paused awhile, Struggling for utterance; then with breathless speed, And pale as him he mourn'd for, Francis came, And hung in silence o'er the blameless man, Even with a brother's sorrow: he pursued, “This Joan will be thy care. I have at home An aged mother—Francis, do thou soothe Her childless age. Nay, weep not for me thus: Sweet to the wretched is the tomb's repose!” So saying, Conrade drew the javelin forth, And died without a groan. By this the scouts, Forerunning the king's march, upon the plain Of Patay had arrived, of late so gay With marshall'd thousands in their radiant arms, And streamers glittering in the noon-tide sun, And blazon'd shields and gay accoutrements, The pageantry of war: but now defiled With mingled dust and blood, and broken arms, And mangled bodies. Soon the monarch joins His victor army. Round the royal flag, Uprear'd in conquest now, the chieftains flock Proffering their eager service. To his arms, Or wisely fearful, or by speedy force Compell'd, the embattled towns submit and own Their rightful king. Baugenci strives in vain: Yenville and Mehun yield; from Sully's wall Hurl'd is the banner'd lion: on they pass, Auxerre, and Troyes, and Chalons, ope their gates, And by the mission'd Maiden's rumour'd deeds Inspirited, the citizens of Rheims Feel their own strength; against the English troops With patriot valour, irresistible, They rise, they conquer, and to their liege lord Present the city keys. The morn was fair When Rheims re-echoed to the busy hum Of multitudes, for high solemnity Assembled. To the holy fabric moves The long procession, through the streets bestrewn With flowers and laurel boughs. The courtier throng Were there, and they in Orleans, who endured The siege right bravely; Gaucour, and La Hire, The gallant Xaintrailles, Boussac, and Chabannes, Alenson, and the bravest of the brave, The Bastard Orleans, now in hope elate, Soon to release from hard captivity His dear-beloved brother; gallant men, And worthy of eternal memory, For they, in the most perilous times of France, Despair'd not of their country. By the king The delegated Damsel pass'd along Clad in her batter'd arms. She bore on high Her hallow'd banner to the sacred pile, And fix'd it on the altar, whilst her hand Pour'd on the monarch's head the mystic oil, Wafted of yore by milk-white dove from heaven, (So legends say) to Clovis when he stood At Rheims for baptism; dubious since that day, When Tolbiac plain reek'd with his warrior's blood, And fierce upon their flight the Almanni prest, And rear'd the shout of triumph; in that hour Clovis invoked aloud the Christian God And conquer'd: waked to wonder thus, the chief Became love's convert, and Clotilda led Her husband to the font. The mission'd Maid Then placed on Charles's brow the crown of France, And back retiring, gazed upon the king One moment, quickly scanning all the past, Till in a tumult of wild wonderment She wept aloud. The assembled multitude In awful stillness witness'd: then at once, As with a tempest-rushing noise of winds, Lifted their mingled clamours. Now the Maid Stood as prepared to speak, and waved her hand, And instant silence followed. “King of France!” She cried, “At Chinon, when my gifted eye Knew thee disguised, what inwardly the spirit Prompted, I promised, with the sword of God, To drive from Orleans far the English wolves, And crown thee in the rescued walls of Rheims. All is accomplish'd. I have here this day Fulfill'd my mission, and anointed thee King over this great nation. Of this charge, Or well perform'd or carelessly, that God Of Whom thou holdest thine authority Will take account; from Him all power derives. Thy duty is to fear the Lord, and rule, According to His word and to the laws, The people thus committed to thy charge: Theirs is to fear Him and to honour Thee, And with that fear and honour to obey In all things lawful; both being thus alike By duty bound, alike restricted both From wilful license. If thy heart be set To do His will and in His ways to walk, I know no limit to the happiness Thou may'st create. I do beseech thee, King!” The Maid exclaim'd, and fell upon the ground And clasp'd his knees, “I do beseech thee, King! By all the thousands that depend on thee, For weal or woe, . . consider what thou art, By Whom appointed! If thou dost oppress Thy people, if to aggrandize thyself Thou tear'st them from their homes, and sendest them To slaughter, prodigal of misery; If when the widow and the orphan groan In want and wretchedness, thou turnest thee To hear the music of the flatterer's tongue; If when thou hear'st of thousands who have fallen, Thou say'st, ‘I am a King! and fit it is That these should perish for me;’ . . if thy realm Should, through the counsels of thy government, Be fill'd with woe, and in thy streets be heard The voice of mourning and the feeble cry Of asking hunger; if in place of Law Iniquity prevail; if Avarice grind The poor; if discipline be utterly Relax'd, Vice charter'd, Wickedness let loose; Though in the general ruin all must share, Each answer for his own peculiar guilt, Yet at the Judgement-day, from those to whom The power was given, the Giver of all power Will call for righteous and severe account. Chuse thou the better part, and rule the land In righteousness; in righteousness thy throne Shall then be stablish'd, not by foreign foes Shaken, nor by domestic enemies, But guarded then by loyalty and love, True hearts, Good Angels, and All-seeing Heaven.” Thus spake the Maid of Orleans, solemnly Accomplishing her marvellous mission here. THE VISION OF THE MAID OF ORLEANS. In the first edition of Joan of Arc this Vision formed the ninth book, allegorical machinery having been introduced throughout the poem as originally written. All that remained of such machinery was expunged in the second edition, and the Vision was then struck out, as no longer according with the general design. THE FIRST BOOK. Orleans was hush'd in sleep. Stretch'd on her couch The delegated Maiden lay; with toil Exhausted, and sore anguish, soon she closed Her heavy eyelids; not reposing then, For busy phantasy in other scenes Awaken'd: whether that superior powers, By wise permission, prompt the midnight dream, Instructing best the passive faculty; Or that the soul, escaped its fleshly clog, Flies free, and soars amid the invisible world, And all things are that seem. Along a moor, Barren, and wide, and drear, and desolate, She roam'd, a wanderer through the cheerless night. Far through the silence of the unbroken plain The bittern's boom was heard; hoarse, heavy, deep, It made accordant music to the scene. Black clouds, driven fast before the stormy wind, Swept shadowing; through their broken folds the moon Struggled at times with transitory ray, And made the moving darkness visible. And now arrived beside a fenny lake She stands, amid whose stagnate waters, hoarse The long reeds rustled to the gale of night. A time-worn bark receives the Maid, impell'd By powers unseen; then did the moon display Where through the crazy vessel's yawning side The muddy waters oozed. A Woman guides, And spreads the sail before the wind, which moan'd As melancholy mournful to her ear, As ever by a dungeon'd wretch was heard Howling at evening round his prison towers. Wan was the pilot's countenance, her eyes Hollow, and her sunk cheeks were furrow'd deep, Channell'd by tears; a few grey locks hung down Beneath her hood: and through the Maiden's veins Chill crept the blood, when, as the night-breeze pass'd, Lifting her tatter'd mantle, coil'd around She saw a serpent gnawing at her heart. The plumeless bats with short shrill note flit by, And the night-raven's scream came fitfully, Borne on the hollow blast. Eager the Maid Look'd to the shore, and now upon the bank Leapt, joyful to escape, yet trembling still In recollection. There, a mouldering pile Stretch'd its wide ruins, o'er the plain below Casting a gloomy shade, save where the moon Shone through its fretted windows: the dark yew, Withering with age, branch'd there its naked roots, And there the melancholy cypress rear'd Its head; the earth was heaved with many a mound, And here and there a half-demolish'd tomb. And now, amid the ruin's darkest shade, The Virgin's eye beheld where pale blue flames Rose wavering, now just gleaming from the earth, And now in darkness Grown'd. An aged man Sate near, seated on what in long-past days Had been some sculptured monument, now fallen And half-obscured by moss, and gather'd heaps Of wither'd yew-leaves and earth-mouldering bones. His eye was large and rayless, and fix'd full Upon the Maid; the tomb-fires on his face Shed a blue light; his face was of the hue Of death; his limbs were mantled in a shroud. Then with a deep heart-terrifying voice, Exclaim'd the spectre, “Welcome to these realms, These regions of Despair, O thou whose steps Sorrow hath guided to my sad abodes! Welcome to my drear empire, to this gloom Eternal, to this everlasting night, Where never morning darts the enlivening ray, Where never shines the sun, but all is dark, Dark as the bosom of their gloomy King.” So saying, he arose, and drawing on, Her to the abbey's inner ruin led, Resisting not his guidance. Through the roof Once fretted and emblazed, but broken now In part, elsewhere all open to the sky, The moon-beams enter'd, chequer'd here, and here With unimpeded light. The ivy twined Round the dismantled columns; imaged forms Of saints and warlike chiefs, moss-canker'd now And mutilate, lay strewn upon the ground, With crumbled fragments, crucifixes fallen, And rusted trophies. Meantime overhead Roar'd the loud blast, and from the tower the owl Scream'd as the tempest shook her secret nest. He, silent, led her on, and often paused, And pointed, that her eye might contemplate At leisure the drear scene. He dragg'd her on Through a low iron door, down broken stairs; Then a cold horror through the Maiden's frame Crept, for she stood amid a vault, and saw, By the sepulchral lamp's dim glaring light, The fragments of the dead. “Look here!” he cried, “Damsel, look here! survey this house of death; O soon to tenant it; soon to increase These trophies of mortality, . . for hence Is no return. Gaze here; behold this skull, These eyeless sockets, and these unflesh'd jaws, That with their ghastly grinning seem to mock Thy perishable charms; for thus thy cheek Must moulder. Child of grief! shrinks not thy soul, Viewing these horrors? trembles not thy heart At the dread thought that here its life's-blood soon Shall stagnate, and the finely-fibred frame, Now warm in life and feeling, mingle soon With the cold clod? thing horrible to think, . . Yet in thought only, for reality Is none of suffering here; here all is peace; No nerve will throb to anguish in the grave. Dreadful it is to think of losing life, But having lost, knowledge of loss is not, Therefore no ill. Oh, wherefore then delay To end all ills at once!” So spake Despair. The vaulted roof echoed his hollow voice, And all again was silence. Quick her heart Panted. He placed a dagger in her hand, And cried again, “Oh wherefore then delay! One blow, and rest for ever!” On the fiend, Dark scowl'd the Virgin with indignant eye, And threw the dagger down. He next his heart Replaced the murderous steel, and drew the Maid Along the downward vault. The damp earth gave A dim sound as they pass'd: the tainted air Was cold, and heavy with unwholesome dews. “Behold!” the fiend exclaim'd, “how loathsomely The fleshly remnant of mortality Moulders to clay!” then fixing his broad eye Full on her face, he pointed where a corpse Lay livid; she beheld with horrent look, The spectacle abhorr'd by living man. “Look here!” Despair pursued, “this loathsome mass Was once as lovely, and as full of life As, Damsel, thou art now. Those deep-sunk eyes Once beam'd the mild light of intelligence, And where thou seest the pamper'd flesh-worm trail, Once the white bosom heaved. She fondly thought That at the hallow'd altar, soon the priest Should bless her coming union, and the torch Its joyful lustre o'er the hall of joy, Cast on her nuptial evening: earth to earth That priest consign'd her, for her lover went By glory lured to war, and perish'd there; Nor she endured to live. Ha! fades thy cheek? Dost thou then, Maiden, tremble at the tale? Look here! behold the youthful paramour! The self-devoted hero!” Fearfully The Maid look'd down, and saw the well-known face Of Theodore. In thoughts unspeakable, Convulsed with horror, o'er her face she clasp'd Her cold damp hands: “Shrink not,” the phantom cried, “Gaze on!” and unrelentingly he grasp'd Her quivering arm: “this lifeless mouldering clay, As well thou know'st, was warm with all the glow Of youth and love; this is the hand that cleft Proud Salisbury's crest, now motionless in death, Unable to protect the ravaged frame From the foul offspring of mortality That feed on heroes. Though long years were thine, Yet never more would life reanimate This slaughter'd youth; slaughter'd for thee! for thou Didst lead him to the battle from his home, Where else he had survived to good old age: In thy defence he died: strike then! destroy Remorse with life.” The Maid stood motionless, And, wistless what she did, with trembling hand Received the dagger. Starting then, she cried, “Avaunt, Despair! Eternal Wisdom deals Or peace to man, or misery, for his good Alike design'd; and shall the creature cry, ‘Why hast thou done this?’ and with impious pride Destroy the life God gave?” The fiend rejoin'd, “And thou dost deem it impious to destroy The life God gave? What, Maiden, is the lot Assign'd to mortal man? born but to drag, Through life's long pilgrimage, the wearying load Of being; care-corroded at the heart; Assail'd by all the numerous train of ills That flesh inherits; till at length worn out, This is his consummation!—Think again! What, Maiden, canst thou hope from lengthen'd life, But lengthen'd sorrow? If protracted long, Till on the bed of death thy feeble limbs Stretch out their languid length, oh think what thoughts, What agonizing feelings, in that hour, Assail the sinking heart! slow beats the pulse, Dim grows the eye, and clammy drops bedew The shuddering frame; then in its mightiest force, Mightiest in impotence, the love of life Seizes the throbbing heart; the faltering lips Pour out the impious prayer that fain would change The Unchangeable's decree; surrounding friends Sob round the sufferer, wet his cheek with tears And all he loved in life embitters death. “Such, Maiden, are the pangs that wait the hour Of easiest dissolution! yet weak man Resolves, in timid piety, to live; And veiling Fear in Superstition's garb, He calls her Resignation! Coward wretch! Fond coward, thus to make his reason war Against his reason! Insect as he is, This sport of chance, this being of a day, Whose whole existence the next cloud may blast, Believes himself the care of heavenly powers, That God regards man, miserable man, And preaching thus of power and providence, Will crush the reptile that may cross his path! “Fool that thou art! the Being that permits Existence, gives to man the worthless boon: A goodly gift to those who, fortune-blest, Bask in the sunshine of prosperity, And such do well to keep it. But to one Sick at the heart with misery, and sore With many a hard unmerited affliction, It is a hair that chains to wretchedness The slave who dares not burst it! Thinkest thou, The parent, if his child should unrecall'd Return and fall upon his neck, and cry, ‘Oh! the wide world is comfortless, and full Of fleeting joys and heart-consuming cares, I can be only happy in my home With thee—my friend!—my father!’ Thinkest thou, That he would thrust him as an outcast forth? Oh! he would clasp the truant to his heart, And love the trespass.” Whilst he spake, his eye Dwelt on the Maiden's cheek, and read her soul Struggling within. In trembling doubt she stood, Even as a wretch, whose famish'd entrails crave Supply, before him sees the poison'd food In greedy horror. Yet, not silent long, “Eloquent tempter cease!” the Maiden cried, “What though affliction be my portion here, Thinkest thou I do not feel high thoughts of joy, Of heart-ennobling joy, when I look back Upon a life of duty well perform'd, Then lift mine eyes to Heaven, and there in faith Know my reward? . . . I grant, were this life all, Was there no morning to the tomb's long night, If man did mingle with the senseless clod, Himself as senseless, then wert thou indeed A wise and friendly comforter! . . But, fiend, There is a morning to the tomb's long night, A dawn of glory, a reward in heaven, He shall not gain who never merited. If thou didst know the worth of one good deed In life's last hour, thou would'st not bid me lose The precious privilege, while life endures To do my Father's will. A mighty task Is mine, . . a glorious call. France looks to me For her deliverance. “Maiden, thou hast done Thy mission here,” the unbaffled fiend replied: “The foes are fled from Orleans: thou, perchance Exulting in the pride of victory, Forgettest him who perish'd: yet albeit Thy harden'd heart forget the gallant youth, That hour allotted canst thou not escape, That dreadful hour, when contumely and shame Shall sojourn in thy dungeon. Wretched Maid! Destined to drain the cup of bitterness, Even to its dregs, . . England's inhuman chiefs Shall scoff thy sorrows, blacken thy pure fame, Wit-wanton it with lewd barbarity, And force such burning blushes to the cheek Of virgin modesty, that thou shalt wish The earth might cover thee. In that last hour, When thy bruis'd breast shall heave beneath the chains That link thee to the stake, a spectacle For the brute multitude, and thou shalt hear Mockery more painful than the circling flames Which then consume thee; wilt thou not in vain Then wish my friendly aid? then wish thine ear Had drank my words of comfort? that thy hand Had grasp'd the dagger, and in death preserved Insulted modesty?” Her glowing cheek Blush'd crimson; her wide eye on vacancy Was fix'd; her breath short panted. The cold fiend, Grasping her hand, exclaim'd, “Too-timid Maid So long repugnant to the healing aid My friendship proffers, now shalt thou behold The allotted length of life.” He stamp'd the earth, And dragging a huge coffin as his car, Two Gouls came on, of form more fearful-foul Than ever palsied in her wildest dream Hag-ridden Superstition. Then Despair Seized on the Maid whose curdling blood stood still, And placed her in the seat, and on they pass'd Adown the deep descent. A meteor light Shot from the dæmons, as they dragg'd along The unwelcome load, and mark'd their brethren feast On carcasses. Below, the vault dilates Its ample bulk. “Look here!”—Despair addrest The shuddering Virgin, “see the dome of Death!” It was a spacious cavern, hewn amid The entrails of the earth, as though to form A grave for all mankind: no eye could reach, Its distant bounds. There, throned in darkness, dwelt The unseen power of Death. Here stopt the Gouls, Reaching the destined spot. The fiend stept out, And from the coffin as he led the Maid, Exclaim'd, “Where mortal never stood before, Thou standest: look around this boundless vault; Observe the dole that Nature deals to man, And learn to know thy friend.” She answer'd not, Observing where the Fates their several tasks Plied ceaseless. “Mark how long the shortest web Allow'd to man!” he cried; “observe how soon, Twined round yon never-resting wheel, they change Their snowy hue, darkening through many a shade, Till Atropos relentless shuts the sheers.” Too true he spake, for of the countless threads, Drawn from the heap, as white as unsunn'd snow, Or as the spotless lily of the vale, Was never one beyond the little span Of infancy untainted: few there were But lightly tinged; more of deep crimson hue, Or deeper sable died. Two Genii stood, Still as the web of being was drawn forth, Sprinkling their powerful drops. From ebon urn, The one unsparing dash'd the bitter drops Of woe; and as he dash'd, his dark-brown brow Relax'd to a hard smile. The milder form Shed less profusely there his lesser store; Sometimes with tears increasing the scant boon, Compassionating man; and happy he Who on his thread those precious tears receives; If it be happiness to have the pulse That throbs with pity, and in such a world Of wretchedness, the generous heart that aches With anguish at the sight of human woe. To her the fiend, well hoping now success, “This is thy thread; observe how short the span; And little doth the evil Genius spare His bitter tincture there.” The Maiden saw Calmly. “Now gaze!” the tempter fiend exclaim'd, And placed again the poniard in her hand, For Superstition, with a burning torch, Approach'd the loom. “This, Damsel, is thy fate! The hour draws on—now strike the dagger home! Strike now, and be at rest!” The Maid replied, “Or to prevent or change the will of Heaven, Impious I strive not: let that will be done!” THE SECOND BOOK. She spake, and lo! celestial radiance beam'd Amid the air, such odours wafting now As erst came blended with the evening gale, From Eden's bowers of bliss. An angel from Stood by the Maid; his wings, ethereal white, Flash'd like the diamond in the noon-tide sun, Dazzling her mortal eye: all else appear'd Her Theodore. Amazed she saw: the fiend Was fled, and on her ear the well-known voice Sounded, though now more musically sweet Than ever yet had thrill'd her soul attuned, When eloquent affection fondly told The day-dreams of delight. “Beloved Maid! Lo! I am with thee, still thy Theodore! Hearts in the holy bands of love combined, Death has no power to sever. Thou art mine! A little while and thou shalt dwell with me, In scenes where sorrow is not. Cheerily Tread thou the path that leads thee to the grave, Rough though it be and painful, for the grave Is but the threshold of eternity. “Favour'd of Heaven, to thee is given to view These secret realms. The bottom of the abyss Thou treadest, Maiden. Here the dungeons are Where bad men learn repentance. Souls diseased Must have their remedy; and where disease Is rooted deep, the remedy is long Perforce, and painful.” Thus the spirit spake, And led the Maid along a narrow path, Dark gleaming to the light of far-off flames, More dread than darkness. Soon the distant sound Of clanking anvils, and the lengthen'd breath Provoking fire are heard: and now they reach A wide expanded den where all around Tremendous furnaces, with hellish blaze, Were burning. At the heaving bellows stood The meagre form of Care, and as he blew To augment the fire, the fire augmented scorch'd His wretched limbs; sleepless for ever thus He toil'd and toil'd, of toil no end to know But endless toil and never-ending woe. An aged man went round the infernal vault, Urging his workmen to their ceaseless task; White were his locks, as is the wintry snow On hoar Plinlimmon's head. A golden staff His steps supported: powerful talisman, Which whoso feels shall never feel again The tear of pity, or the throb of love. Touch'd but by this, the massy gates give way, The buttress trembles, and the guarded wall, Guarded in vain, submits. Him heathens erst Had deified, and bowed the suppliant knee To Plutus. Nor are now his votaries few, Even though our blessed Saviour hath himself Told us, that easier through the needle's eye Shall the huge camel pass, than the rich man Enter the gates of heaven. “Ye cannot serve Your God, and worship Mammon.” “Mission'd Maid!” So spake the spirit, “know that these, whose hands Round each white furnace ply the unceasing toil, Were Mammon's slaves on earth. They did not spare To wring from poverty the hard-earn'd mite, They robb'd the orphan's pittance, they could see Want's asking eye unmoved; and therefore these, Ranged round the furnace, still must persevere In Mammon's service, scorch'd by these fierce fires, Nor seldom by the overboiling ore Caught; yet retaining still, to punishment Converted here, their old besetting sin, Often impatiently to quench their thirst Unquenchable, large draughts of molten gold They drink insatiate, still with pain renew'd, Pain to destroy.” So saying, her he led Fortn from the dreadful cavern to a cell, Brilliant with gem-born light. The rugged walls Part gleam'd with gold, and part with silver ore In milder radiance shone. The carbuncle There its strong lustre like the flamy sun Shot forth irradiate; from the earth beneath, And from the roof there stream'd a diamond light; Rubies and amethysts their glows commix'd With the gay topaz, and the softer ray Shot from the sapphire, and the emerald's hue, And bright pyropus. There on golden seats, A numerous, sullen, melancholy train Sat silent. “Maiden, these,” said Theodore, “Are they who let the love of wealth absorb All other passions; in their souls that vice Struck deeply-rooted, like the poison-tree That with its shade spreads barrenness around. These, Maid! were men by no atrocious crime Blacken'd, no fraud, nor ruffian violence; Men of fair dealing, and respectable On earth, but such as only for themselves Heap'd up their treasures, deeming all their wealth Their own, and given to them, by partial Heaven, To bless them only: therefore here they sit, Possess'd of gold enough, and by no pain Tormented, save the knowledge of the bliss They lost, and vain repentance. Here they dwell, Loathing these useless treasures, till the hour Of general restitution.” Thence they past, And now arriv'd at such a gorgeous dome, As even the pomp of eastern opulence Could never equal: wandered through its halls A numerous train; some with the red-swoln eye Of riot, and intemperance-bloated cheek; Some pale and nerveless, and with feeble step, And eyes lack-lustre. “Maiden!” said her guide, “These are the wretched slaves of Appetite, Curst with their wish enjoy'd. The epicure Here pampers his foul frame, till the pall'd sense Loathes at the banquet; the voluptuous here Plunge in the tempting torrent of delight, And sink in misery. All they wish'd on earth Possessing here, whom have they to accuse But their own folly, for the lot they chose? Yet, for that these injured themselves alone, They to the house of Penitence may hie, And, by a long and painful regimen, To wearied Nature her exhausted powers Restore, till they shall learn to form the wish Of wisdom, and Almighty Goodness grants That prize to him who seeks it.” Whilst he spake, The board is spread. With bloated paunch, and eyes Fat-swoln, and legs whose monstrous size disgraced The human form divine, their caterer, Hight Gluttony, set forth the smoaking feast. And by his side came on a brother form, With fiery cheek of purple hue, and red And scurfy-white, mix'd motley; his gross bulk, Like some huge hogshead shapen'd, as applied. Him had antiquity with mystic rites Adored; to him the sons of Greece, and thine Imperial Rome, on many an altar pour'd The victim blood, with godlike titles graced, Bacchus, or Dionusus; son of Jove, Deem'd falsely, for from Folly's idiot form He sprung, what time Madness, with furious hand, Seized on the laughing female. At one birth She brought the brethren, menial here below, Though sovereigns upon earth, where oft they hold High revels. 'Mid the monastery's gloom, Thy palace Gluttony, and oft to thee The sacrifice is spread, when the grave voice Episcopal proclaims approaching day Of visitation; or churchwardens meet To save the wretched many from the gripe Of poverty; or 'mid thy ample halls Of London, mighty Mayor! rich Aldermen, Of coming feast hold converse. Otherwhere, For though allied in nature as in blood, They hold divided sway, his brother lifts His spungy sceptre. In the noble domes Of princes, and state-wearied ministers, Maddening he reigns; and when the affrighted mind Casts o'er a long career of guilt and blood Its eye reluctant, then his aid is sought To lull the worm of conscience to repose. He too the halls of country squires frequents; But chiefly loves the learned gloom that shades Thy offspring Rhedycina, and thy walls Granta! nightly libations there to him Profuse are pour'd, till from the dizzy brain Triangles, circles, parallelograms, Moods, tenses, dialects, and demigods, And logic and theology are swept By the red deluge. Unmolested there He revels; till the general feast comes round, The sacrifice septennial, when the sons Of England meet, with watchful care to chuse Their delegates, wise, independent men, Unbribing and unbribed, and chosen to guard Their rights and charters from the encroaching grasp Of greedy power; then all the joyful land Join in his sacrifices, so inspired To make the important choice. The observing Maid Address'd her guide, “These, Theodore, thou say'st Are men, who pampering their foul appetites, Injured themselves alone. But where are they, The worst of villains, viper-like, who coil Around deluded woman, so to sting The heart that loves them?” “Them,” the spirit replied, “A long and dreadful punishment awaits. For when the prey of want and infamy, Lower and lower still the victim sinks, Even to the depth of shame, not one lewd word, One impious imprecation from her lips Escapes, nay not a thought of evil lurks In the polluted mind, that does not plead Before the throne of Justice, thunder-tongued Against the foul seducer.” Now they reach'd The house of Penitence. Credulity Stood at the gate, stretching her eager head As though to listen; on her vacant face, A look that promised premature assent; Though her Regret behind, a meagre fiend, Disciplined sorely. Here they enter'd in, And now arrived where, as in study tranced, They saw the mistress of the dome. Her face Spake that composed severity, that knows No angry impulse, no weak tenderness, Resolved and calm. Before her lay the Book, Which hath the words of life; and as she read, Sometimes a tear would trickle down her cheek, Though heavenly joy beam'd in her eye the while. Leaving her undisturb'd, to the first ward Of this great lazar-house, the Angel led The favour'd Maid of Orleans. Kneeling down On the hard stone which their bare knees had worn, In sackcloth robed, a numerous train appear'd: Hard-featured some, and some demurely grave; Yet such expression stealing from the eye, As though, that only naked, all the rest Were one close-fitting mask. A scoffing fiend, For fiend he was, though wisely serving here, Mock'd at his patients, and did often strew Ashes upon them, and then bid them say Their prayers aloud, and then he louder laugh'd: For these were hypocrites, on earth revered As holy ones, who did in public tell Their beads, and make long prayers, and cross themselves, And call themselves most miserable sinners, That so they might be deem'd most pious saints; And go all filth, and never let a smile Bend their stern muscles; gloomy, sullen men, Barren of all affection, and all this To please their God, forsooth! And therefore Scorn Grinn'd at his patients, making them repeat Their solemn farce, with keenest raillery Tormenting; but if earnest in their prayer, They pour'd the silent sorrows of the soul To heaven, then did they not regard his mocks Which then came painless, and Humility Then rescued them, and led to Penitence, That she might lead to heaven. From thence they came, Where, in the next ward, a most wretched band Groan'd underneath the bitter tyranny Of a fierce dæmon. His coarse hair was red, Pale grey his eyes, and blood-shot; and his face Wrinkled by such a smile as Malice wears In ecstacy. Well-pleased he went around, Plunging his dagger in the hearts of some, Or probing with a poison'd lance their breasts, Or placing coals of fire within their wounds; Or seizing some within his mighty grasp, He fix'd them on a stake, and then drew back And laugh'd to see them writhe. “These,” said the spirit, “Are taught by Cruelty, to loathe the lives They led themselves. Here are those wicked men Who loved to exercise their tyrant power On speechless brutes; bad husbands undergo A long purgation here; the traffickers In human flesh here too are disciplined, Till by their suffering they have equall'd all The miseries they inflicted, all the mass Of wretchedness caused by the wars they waged, The villages they burnt, the widows left In want, the slave or led to suicide, Or murder'd by the foul infected air Of his close dungeon, or, more sad than all, His virtue lost, his very soul enslaved, And driven by woe to wickedness. These next, Whom thou beholdest in this dreary room, With sullen eyes of hatred and of fear Each on the other scowling, these have been False friends. Tormented by their own dark thoughts Here they dwell: in the hollow of their hearts There is a worm that feeds, and though thou seest That skilful leech who willingly would heal The ill they suffer, judging of all else By their own evil conscience, they suspect The aid he vainly proffers, lengthening thus By vice its punishment.” “But who are these,” The Maid exclaim'd, “that robed in flowing lawn, And mitred, or in scarlet, and in caps Like cardinals, I see in every ward, Performing menial service at the beck Of all who bid them?” Theodore replied, “These men are they who in the name of Christ Have heap'd up wealth, and arrogating power, Have made kings kiss their feet, yet call'd themselves The servants of the servants of the Lord. They dwelt in palaces, in purple clothed, And in fine linen; therefore are they here; And though they would not minister on earth, Here penanced they perforce must minister: Did not the Holy One of Nazareth, Tell them, his kingdom is not of the world?” So saying, on they past, and now arrived Where such a hideous ghastly groupe abode, That the Maid gazed with half-averting eye, And shudder'd: each one was a loathly corpse, The worm was feeding on his putrid prey, Yet had they life and feeling exquisite Though motionless and mute. “Most wretched men Are these,” the angel cried. “Poets thou see'st Whose loose lascivious lays perpetuated Their own corruption. Soul-polluted slaves, Who sate them down, deliberately lewd, So to awake and pamper lust in minds Unborn; and therefore foul of body now As then they were of soul, they here abide Long as the evil works they left on earth Shall live to taint mankind. A dreadful doom! Yet amply merited by all who thus Have to the Devil's service dedicated The gift of song, the gift divine of Heaven!” And now they reach'd a huge and massy pile, Massy it seem'd, and yet with every blast As to its ruin shook. There, porter fit, Remorse for ever his sad vigils kept. Pale, hollow-eyed, emaciate, sleepless wretch, Inly he groan'd, or starting, wildly shriek'd, Aye as the fabric tottering from its base, Threaten'd its fall, and so expectant still Lived in the dread of danger still delay'd. They enter'd there a large and lofty dome, O'er whose black marble sides a dim drear light Struggled with darkness from the unfrequent lamp. Enthroned around, the murderers of mankind, Monarchs, the great, the glorious, the august, Each bearing on his brow a crown of fire, Sat stern and silent. Nimrod, he was there, First king, the mighty hunter; and that chief Who did belie his mother's fame, that so He might be called young Ammon. In this court Cæsar was crown'd, the great liberticide; And he who to the death of Cicero Consented, though the courtly minion's lyre Hath hymn'd his praise, though Maro sung to him, And when death levell'd to original clay The royal body, impious Flattery Fell at his feet, and worshipp'd the new god. Titus was here, the conqueror of the Jews, He the delight of human-kind misnamed; Cæsars and Soldans, Emperors and Kings, All who for glory fought, here they were all, Here in the Hall of Glory, reaping now The meed they merited. As gazing round The Virgin mark'd the miserable train, A deep and hollow voice from one went forth; “Thou who art come to view our punishment, Maiden of Orleans! hither turn thine eye, For I am he whose bloody victories Thy power hath render'd vain. Lo! I am here, The hero conqueror of Agincourt, Henry of England! . . Wretched that I am! I might have reign'd in happiness and peace, My coffers full, my subjects undisturb'd, And Plenty and Prosperity had loved To dwell amongst them: but in evil hour Seeing the realm of France, by faction torn, I thought in pride of heart that it would fall An easy prey. I persecuted those Who taught new doctrines, though they taught the truth: And when I heard of thousands by the sword Cut off, or blasted by the pestilence, I calmly counted up my proper gains, And sent new herds to slaughter. Temperate Myself, no blood that mutinied, no vice Tainting my private life, I sent abroad Murder and Rape; and therefore am I doom'd, Like these imperial sufferers, crown'd with fire, Here to remain, till man's awaken'd eye Shall see the genuine blackness of our deeds; And warn'd by them, till the whole human race, Equalling in bliss the aggregate we caused Of wretchedness, shall form one brotherhood, One universal family of love.” THE THIRD BOOK. The Maiden, musing on the warrior's words, Turn'd from the Hall of Glory. Now they reach'd A cavern, at whose mouth a Genius stood, In front a beardless youth, whose smiling eye Beam'd promise, but behind, wither'd and old, And all unlovely. Underneath his feet Records obliterate lay, and laurels sere. He held an hour-glass, and as the sands fall, So pass the lives of men. By him they past Along the darksome cave, and reach'd a stream, Still rolling onward its perpetual course Noiseless and undisturb'd. Here they ascend A bark unpiloted, that down the stream, Borne by the current, rush'd, which circling still, Returning to itself, an island form'd; Nor had the Maiden's footsteps ever reach'd The insulated coast, eternally Rapt round in endless whirl; but Theodore Drove with a spirit's will the obedient bark. They land; a mighty fabric meets their eyes, Seen by it's gem-born light. Of adamant The pile was framed, for ever to abide Firm in eternal strength. Before the gate Stood eager Expectation, as to catch The half-heard murmurs issuing from within, Her mouth half-open'd, and her head stretch'd forth. On the other side there stood an aged crone, Listening to every breath of air; she knew Vague suppositions and uncertain dreams Of what was soon to come, for she would mark The little glow-worm's self-emitted light, And argue thence of kingdoms overthrown, And desolated nations; ever fill'd With undetermined terror, as she heard Or distant screech-owl, or the regular beat Of evening death-watch. “Maid,” the spirit cried, “Here, robed in shadows, dwells Futurity. There is no eye hath seen her secret form, For round the Mother of Time, eternal mists Hover. If thou would'st read the book of fate, Go in!” The damsel for a moment paused, Then to the angel spake: “All-gracious Heaven. Benignant in withholding, hath denied To man that knowledge. I, in faith assured, Knowing my heavenly Father, for the best Ordaineth all things, in that faith remain Contented.” “Well and wisely hast thou said,” So Theodore replied; “and now, O Maid! Is there amid this boundless universe One whom thy soul would visit? Is there place To memory dear, or vision'd out by hope, Where thou would'st now be present? form the wish, And I am with thee, there.” His closing speech Yet sounded on her ear, and lo! they stood Swift as the sudden thought that guided them, Within the little cottage that she loved. “He sleeps! the good man sleeps!” enrapt she cried, As bending o'er her uncle's lowly bed Her eye retraced his features. “See the beads Which never morn nor night he fails to tell, Remembering me, his child, in every prayer. Oh! peaceful be thy sleep, thou dear old man! Good Angels guard thy rest! and when thine hour Is come, as gently may'st thou wake to life, As when through yonder lattice the next sun Shall bid thee to thy morning orisons!” “Thy voice is heard,” the angel guide rejoin'd, “He sees thee in his dreams, he hears thee breathe Blessings, and happy is the good man's rest. Thy fame has reach'd him, for who hath not heard Thy wondrous exploits? and his aged heart Hath felt the deepest joy that ever yet Made his glad blood flow fast. Sleep on, old Claude! Peaceful, pure spirit, be thy sojourn here, And short and soon thy passage to that world Where friends shall part no more! Does thy soul own No other wish? or sleeps poor Madelon Forgotten in her grave? . . . Sees't thou yon star,” The spirit pursued, regardless that her eye Reproach'd him; “Seeëst thou that evening star Whose lovely light so often we beheld From yonder woodbine porch? How have we gazed Into the dark deep sky, till the baffled soul, Lost in the infinite, return'd, and felt The burthen of her bodily load, and yearn'd For freedom! Maid, in yonder evening star Lives thy departed friend. I read that glance, And we are there!” He said, and they had past The immeasurable space. Then on her ear The lonely song of adoration rose, Sweet as the cloister'd virgin's vesper hymn, Whose spirit, happily dead to earthly hopes, Already lives in heaven. Abrupt the song Ceased, tremulous and quick a cry Of joyful wonder roused the astonish'd Maid, And instant Madelon was in her arms; No airy form, no unsubstantial shape, She felt her friend, she prest her to her heart, Their tears of rapture mingled. She drew back, And eagerly she gazed on Madelon, Then fell upon her neck and wept again. No more she saw the long-drawn lines of grief, The emaciate form, the hue of sickliness, The languid eye: youth's loveliest freshness now Mantled her cheek, whose every lineament Bespake the soul at rest, a holy calm, A deep and full tranquillity of bliss. “Thou then art come, my first and dearest friend!” The well-known voice of Madelon began, “Thou then art come! And was thy pilgrimage So short on earth? and was it painful too, Painful and short as mine? but blessed they Who from the crimes and miseries of the world Early escape!” “Nay,” Theodore replied, “She hath not yet fulfill'd her mortal work. Permitted visitant from earth she comes To see the seat of rest; and oftentimes In sorrow shall her soul remember this And patient of its transitory woe, Partake again the anticipated joy.” “Soon be that work perform'd!” the Maid exclaim'd, “O Madelon! O Theodore! my soul, Spurning the cold communion of the world, Will dwell with you. But I shall patiently, Yea, even with joy, endure the allotted ills Of which the memory in this better state Shall heighten bliss. That hour of agony, When, Madelon, I felt thy dying grasp, And from thy forehead wiped the dews of death, The very anguish of that hour becomes A joy for memory now.” “O earliest friend! I too remember,” Madelon replied, “That hour, thy looks of watchful agony, The supprest grief that struggled in thine eye Endearing love's last kindness. Thou did'st know With what a deep and earnest hope intense I felt the hour draw on: but who can speak The unutterable transport, when mine eyes, As from a long and dreary dream, unclosed Amid this peaceful vale, . . unclosed upon My Arnaud! He had built me up a bower, A bower of rest.—See, Maiden, where he comes, His manly lineaments, his beaming eye The same, but now a holier innocence Sits on his cheek, and loftier thoughts illume The enlighten'd glance.” They met; what joy was theirs He best can feel, who for a dear friend dead Hath wet the midnight pillow with his tears. Fair was the scene around; an ample vale Whose mountain circle at the distant verge Lay soften'd on the sight; the near ascent Rose bolder up, in part abrupt and bare, Part with the ancient majesty of woods Adorn'd, or lifting high its rocks sublime. A river's liquid radiance roll'd beneath; Beside the bower of Madelon it wound A broken stream, whose shallows, though the waves Roll'd on their way with rapid melody, A child might tread. Behind, an orange grove Its gay green foliage starr'd with golden fruit. But with what odours did their blossoms load The passing gale of eve! Less thrilling sweets Rose from the marble's perforated floor, Where kneeling at her prayers, the Moorish queen Inhaled the cool delight, and whilst she ask'd The prophet for his promised paradise, Shaped from the present bliss its utmost joys. A goodly scene! fair as that faery land Where Arthur lives, by ministering spirits borne From Camelot's bloody banks; or as the groves Of earliest Eden, where, so legends say, Enoch abides; and he who, rapt away By fiery steeds and charioted in fire, Past in his mortal form the eternal ways; And John, beloved of Christ, enjoying there The beatific vision, sometimes seen, The distant dawning of eternal day, Till all things be fulfilled. “Survey this scene!” So Theodore address'd the Maid of Arc, “There is no evil here, no wretchedness; It is the heaven of those who nurst on earth Their nature's gentlest feelings. Yet not here Centering their joys, but with a patient hope, Waiting the allotted hour when capable Of loftier callings, to a better state They pass; and hither from that better state Frequent they come, preserving so those ties Which through the infinite progressiveness Complete our perfect bliss. Even such, so blest, Save that the memory of no sorrows past Heighten'd the present joy, our world was once, In the first æra of its innocence, Ere man had learnt to bow the knee to man. Was there a youth whom warm affection fill'd, He spake his honest heart; the earliest fruits His toil produced, the sweetest flowers that deck'd The sunny bank, he gather'd for the maid, Nor she disdain'd the gift; for Vice not yet Had burst the dungeons of her Hell, and rear'd Those artificial boundaries that divide Man from his species. State of blessedness! Till that ill-omen'd hour when Cain's true son Delved in the bowels of the earth for gold, Accursed bane of virtue, . . of such force As poets feign dwelt in the Gorgon's locks, Which whoso saw, felt instant the life-blood Cold curdle in his veins, the creeping flesh Grew stiff with horror, and the heart forgot To beat. Accursed hour! for man no more To Justice paid his homage, but forsook Her altars, and bow'd down before the shrine Of Wealth and Power, the idols he had made. Then Hell enlarged herself, her gates flew wide, Her legion fiends rush'd forth. Oppression came, Whose frown is desolation, and whose breath Blasts like the pestilence; and Poverty, A meagre monster, who with withering touch Makes barren all the better part of man, Mother of Miseries. Then the goodly earth Which God had framed for happiness, became One theatre of woe, and all that God Had given to bless free men, these tyrant fiends His bitterest curses made. Yet for the best Have all things been appointed by the All-wise! For by experience taught shall man at length Dash down his Moloch-idols, Samson-like, And burst his fetters. Then in the abyss Oppression shall be chain'd, and Poverty Die, and with her, her brood of miseries; And Virtue and Equality preserve The reign of Love, and earth shall once again Be Paradise, where Wisdom shall secure The state of bliss which Ignorance betray'd.” “Oh age of happiness!” the Maid exclaim'd, “Roll fast thy current, Time, till that blest age Arrive! and happy thou my Theodore, Permitted thus to see the sacred depths Of wisdom!” “Such,” the blessed spirit replied, “Beloved! such our lot; allowed to range The vast infinity, progressive still In knowledge and increasing blessedness, This our united portion. Thou hast yet A little while to sojourn amongst men: I will be with thee; there shall not a breeze Wanton around thy temples, on whose wing I will not hover near; and at that hour When from its fleshly sepulchre let loose, Thy phœnix soul shall soar, O best-beloved! I will be with thee in thine agonies, And welcome thee to life and happiness, Eternal infinite beatitude!” He spake, and led her near a straw-roof'd cot, Love's palace. By the Virtues circled there The Immortal listen'd to such melodies, As aye, when one good deed is register'd Above, re-echo in the halls of Heaven. Labour was there, his crisp locks floating loose, Clear was his cheek, and beaming his full eye, And strong his arm robust; the wood-nymph Health Still follow'd on his path, and where he trod Fresh flowers and fruits arose. And there was Hope, The general friend; and Pity, whose mild eye Wept o'er the widow'd dove: and, loveliest form, Majestic Chastity, whose sober smile Delights and awes the soul; a laurel wreath Restrain'd her tresses, and upon her breast The snow-drop hung its head, that seem'd to grow Spontaneous, cold and fair. Beside the maid Love went submiss, with eye more dangerous Than fancied basilisk to wound whoe'er Too bold approach'd; yet anxious would he read Here every rising wish, then only pleased When pleasing. Hymning him the song was raised. “Glory to thee whose vivifying power Pervades all Nature's universal frame! Glory to thee, Creator Love! to thee, Parent of all the smiling Charities, That strew the thorny path of life with flowers! Glory to thee, Preserver! To thy praise The awakened woodlands echo all the day Their living melody; and warbling forth To thee her twilight song, the nightingale Holds the lone traveller from his way, or charms The listening poet's ear. Where Love shall deign To fix his seat, there blameless Pleasure sheds Her roseate dews; Content will sojourn there, And Happiness behold Affection's eye Gleam with the mother's smile. Thrice happy he Who feels thy holy power! he shall not drag, Forlorn and friendless, along life's long path To age's drear abode; he shall not waste The bitter evening of his days unsooth'd; But Hope shall cheer his hours of solitude, And Vice shall vainly strive to wound his breast, That bears that talisman; and when he meets The eloquent eye of Tenderness, and hears The bosom-thrilling music of her voice, The joy he feels shall purify his soul, And imp it for anticipated heaven.”</field>

No Maid of Arc Had, in those ages, for her country's cause Wielded the sword of freedom; no Roland Had borne the palm of female fortitude; No Cordé with self-sacrificing zeal Had glorified again the Avenger's name, As erst when Cæsar perish'd: haply too Some strains may hence be drawn, befitting me To offer, nor unworthy thy regard. Robert Southey. Bristol, 1795. THE TRIUMPH OF WOMAN. The Subject of this Poem is taken from the third and fourth Chapters of the First Book of Esdras. Glad as the weary traveller tempest-tost To reach secure at length his native coast, Who wandering long o'er distant lands hath sped, The night-blast wildly howling round his head, Known all the woes of want, and felt the storm Of the bleak winter parch his shivering form; The journey o'er and every peril past Beholds his little cottage-home at last, And as he sees afar the smoke curl slow, Feels his full eyes with transport overflow; So from the scene where Death and Misery reign, And Vice and Folly drench with blood the plain, Joyful I turn, to sing how Woman's praise Avail'd again Jerusalem to raise, Call'd forth the sanction of the Despot's nod, And freed the nation best beloved of God. Darius gives the feast; to Persia's court, Awed by his will, the obedient throng resort: Attending Satraps swell their prince's pride, And vanquish'd Monarchs grace the Conqueror's side. No more the warrior wears the garb of war, Girds on the sword, or mounts the scythed car; No more Judæa's sons dejected go, And hang the head, and heave the sigh of woe. From Persia's rugged hills descend the train, From where Orontes foams along the plain, From where Choaspes rolls his royal waves, And India sends her sons, submissive slaves. Thy daughters, Babylon, for this high feast Weave the loose robe, and paint the flowery vest, With roseate wreaths they braid the glossy hair, They tinge the cheek which nature form'd so fair, Learn the soft step, the soul-subduing glance, Melt in the song, and swim adown the dance. Exalted on the Monarch's golden throne, In royal state the fair Apame shone; Her form of majesty, her eyes of fire, Chill with respect, or kindle with desire; The admiring multitude her charms adore, And own her worthy of the rank she bore. Now on his couch reclined Darius lay, Tired with the toilsome pleasures of the day; Without Judæa's watchful sons await, To guard the sleeping idol of the state. Three youths were these of Judah's royal race, Three youths whom Nature dower'd with every grace, To each the form of symmetry she gave, And haughty genius cursed each favourite slave; These fill'd the cup, around the Monarch kept, Served when he spake, and guarded while he slept. Yet oft for Salem's hallow'd towers laid low The sigh would heave, the unbidden tear would flow And when the dull and wearying round of power Allow'd Zorobabel one vacant hour, He loved on Babylon's high wall to roam, And lingering gaze toward his distant home; Or on Euphrates' willowy banks reclined Hear the sad harp moan fitful to the wind. As now the perfumed lamps stream wide their light, And social converse cheers the livelong night, Thus spake Zorobabel: “Too long in vain For Zion desolate her sons complain; All hopelessly our years of sorrow flow, And these proud heathen mock their captives' woe. While Cyrus triumph'd here in victor state A brighter prospect cheer'd our exiled fate; Our sacred walls again he bade us raise, And to Jehovah rear the pile of praise. Quickly these fond hopes faded from our eyes, As the frail sun that gilds the wintry skies, And spreads a moment's radiance o'er the plain, Soon hid by clouds which dim the scene again. “Opprest by Artaxerxes' jealous reign, We vainly pleaded here, and wept in vain. Now when Darius, chief of mild command, Bids joy and pleasure fill the festive land, Still shall we droop the head in sullen grief, And sternly silent shun to seek relief? What if amid the Monarch's mirthful throng Our harps should echo to the cheerful song?” “Fair is the occasion,” thus the one replied, “Now then let all our tuneful skill be tried. And while the courtiers quaff the smiling bowl, And wine's strong fumes inspire the gladden'd soul, Where all around is merriment, be mine To strike the lute, and praise the power of Wine.” “And while,” his friend rejoin'd, “in state alone, Lord of the earth, Darius fills the throne, Be yours the mighty power of Wine to sing, My lute shall sound the praise of Persia's King.” To them Zorobabel: “On themes like these Seek ye the Monarch of Mankind to please; To Wine superior, or to Power's strong arms, Be mine to sing resistless Woman's charms. To him victorious in the rival lays Shall just Darius give the meed of praise; A purple robe his honour'd frame shall fold, The beverage sparkle in his cup of gold; A golden couch support his bed of rest, The chain of honour grace his favour'd breast; His the rich turban, his the car's array, On Babylon's high wall to wheel its way; And for his wisdom seated on the throne, For the King's Cousin shall the Bard be known.” Intent they meditate the future lay, And watch impatient for the dawn of day. The morn rose clear, and shrill were heard the flute, The cornet, sackbut, dulcimer, and lute; To Babylon's gay streets the throng resort, Swarm through the gates, and fill the festive court. High on his throne Darius tower'd in pride, The fair Apame graced her Sovereign's side: And now she smiled, and now with mimic frown Placed on her brow the Monarch's sacred crown. In transport o'er her faultless form he bends, Loves every look, and every act commends. And now Darius bids the herald call Judæa's Bards to grace the thronging hall. Hush'd are all sounds, the attending crowd are mute, And then the Hebrew gently touch'd the lute: When the Traveller on his way, Who has toil'd the livelong day, Feels around on every side The chilly mists of eventide, Fatigued and faint his weary mind Recurs to all he leaves behind; He thinks upon the well-trimm'd hearth, The evening hour of social mirth, And her who at departing day Weeps for her husband far away. Oh give to him the flowing bowl! Bid it renovate his soul! Then shall sorrow sink to sleep, And he who wept no more shall weep; For his care-clouded brow shall clear, And his glad eye will sparkle through the tear. When the poor man heart-opprest Betakes him to his evening rest, And worn with labour thinks in sorrow On the labour of to-morrow; When repining at his lot He hies him to his joyless cot, And loathes to meet his children there, The rivals for his scanty fare; Oh give to him the flowing bowl! Bid it renovate his soul! The generous juice with magic power Shall cheat with happiness the hour, And with each warm affection fill The heart by want and wretchedness made chill When, at the dim close of day, The Captive loves alone to stray Along the haunts recluse and rude Of sorrow and of solitude; When he sits with mournful eye To mark the lingering radiance die, And lets distempered fancy roam Amid the ruins of his home; . . Oh give to him the flowing bowl! Bid it renovate his soul! The bowl shall better thoughts bestow, And lull to rest his wakeful woe, And joy shall gild the evening hour, And make the Captive Fortune's conqueror When the wearying cares of state Oppress the Monarch with their weight, When from his pomp retired alone He feels the duties of the throne, Feels that the multitude below Depend on him for weal or woe; When his powerful will may bless A realm with peace and happiness, Or with desolating breath Breathe ruin round, and woe, and death; Oh give to him the flowing bowl! Bid it humanize his soul! He shall not feel the empire's weight, He shall not feel the cares of state, The bowl shall each dark thought beguile, And Nations live and prosper from his smile. Hush'd was the lute, the Hebrew ceased the song, Long peals of plaudits echoed from the throng; All tongues the liberal words of praise repaid, On every cheek a smile applauding play'd; The rival Bard approach'd, he struck the string, And pour'd the loftier song to Persia's King. Why should the wearying cares of state Oppress the Monarch with their weight? Alike to him if peace shall bless The multitude with happiness; Alike to him if frenzied War Career triumphant on the embattled plain, And rolling on o'er myriads slain, With gore and wounds shall clog his scythed car. What though the tempest rage? no sound Of the deep thunder shakes his distant throne; And the red flash that spreads destruction round, Reflects a glorious splendour on the crown. Where is the Man who with ennobling pride Regards not his own nature? where is he Who without awe can see The mysteries of the human mind, The miniature of Deity? For Man the vernal clouds descending Shower down their fertilizing rain; For Man the ripen'd harvest bending Waves with soft murmur o'er the plenteous plain. He spreads the sail to catch the favouring gale, Or sweeps with oars the main; For him the winds of heaven subservient blow, Earth teems for him, for him the waters flow, He thinks, and wills, and acts, a Deity below! Where is the King who with elating pride Sees not this Man, this godlike Man his slave? Mean are the mighty by the Monarch's side; Alike the wise, alike the brave With timid step and pale, advance, And tremble at the royal glance; Suspended millions watch his breath, Whose smile is happiness, whose frown is death. Why goes the Peasant from that little cot, Where Peace and Love have blest his humble life? In vain his wretched wife With tears bedews her husband's face, And clasps him in a long and last embrace; In vain his children round his bosom creep, And weep to see their mother weep, Fettering their father with their little arms! What are to him the war's alarms? What are to him the distant foes? He at the earliest dawn of day To daily labour went his way, And when he saw the sun decline, He sate in peace beneath his vine. The King commands, the peasant goes, From all he loved on earth he flies, And for his monarch toils, and fights, and bleeds, and dies. What though yon city's castled wall Cast o'er the darken'd plain its crested shade? What though her Priests in earnest terror call On all their host of Gods to aid? Vain is the bulwark, vain the tower! In vain her gallant youth expose Their breasts, a bulwark, to the foes! In vain at that tremendous hour, Clasp'd in the savage soldier's reeking arms, Shrieks to deaf Heaven the violated Maid! By the rude hand of Ruin scatter'd round, Their moss-grown towers shall spread the desert ground. Low shall the mouldering palace lie, Amid the princely halls the grass wave high, And through the shatter'd roof descend the inclement sky. Gay o'er the embattled plain Moves yonder warrior train, Their banners wanton on the morning gale; Full on their bucklers beams the rising ray, Their glittering helms give glory to the day; The shout of war rings echoing o'er the vale. Far reaches as the aching eye can strain The splendid horror of their wide array. Ah! not in vain expectant, o'er Their glorious pomp the vultures soar! Amid the Conqueror's palace high Shall sound the song of victory; Long after journeying o'er the plain The traveller shall with startled eye See their white bones then blanched by many a winter sky. Lord of the earth! we will not raise The temple to thy bounded praise; For thee no victim need expire, For thee no altar blaze with hallow'd fire; The burning City flames for thee, Thine Altar is the field of victory! Thy sacred Majesty to bless Man a self-offer'd victim freely flies; To thee he sacrifices happiness And peace, and Love's endearing ties; To thee a Slave he lives, for thee a Slave he dies. Hush'd was the lute, the Hebrew ceased to sing; The shout burst forth, “For ever live the King!” Loud was the uproar, as when Rome's decree Pronounced Achaia once again was free; Assembled Greece enrapt with fond belief Heard the false boon, and bless'd the treacherous Chief. Each breast with freedom's holy ardour glows, From every voice the cry of rapture rose. Their thundering clamours rend the astonished sky, And birds o'erpassing hear, and drop, and die. Thus o'er the Persian dome their plaudits ring, And the high hall re-echoed.. “Live the King!” The mutes bow'd reverent down before their Lord, The assembled Satraps envied and adored, Joy sparkled in the Monarch's conscious eyes, And his pleased pride already doom'd the prize. Silent they saw Zorobabel advance: He to Apame turn'd his timid glance; With downward eye he paused, a moment mute, Then with light finger touch'd the softer lute. Apame knew the Hebrew's grateful cause, And bent her head, and sweetly smiled applause. Why is the warrior's cheek so red? Why downward droops his musing head? Why that slow step, that faint advance, That keen yet quick retreating glance? That crested head in war tower'd high, No backward glance disgraced that eye, No flushing fear that cheek o'erspread, When stern he strode o'er heaps of dead: Strange tumult now his bosom moves, . . The Warrior fears because he loves. Why does the Youth delight to rove Amid the dark and lonely grove? Why in the throng where all are gay, With absent eyes from gaiety distraught, Sits he alone in silent thought? Silent he sits, for far away His passion'd soul delights to stray; Recluse he roves as if he fain would shun All human-kind, because he loves but One! Yes, King of Persia, thou art blest! But not because the sparkling bowl To rapture elevates thy waken'd soul; But not because of power possest; Nor that the Nations dread thy nod, And Princes reverence thee their earthly God! Even on a monarch's solitude Will Care, dark visitant, intrude; The bowl brief pleasure can bestow; The purple cannot shield from woe; But, King of Persia, thou art blest, For Heaven who raised thee thus the world above, Hath made thee happy in Apame's love! Oh! I have seen him fondly trace The heavenly features of her face, Rove o'er her form with eager eye, And sigh and gaze, and gaze and sigh. See! from his brow with mimic frown A pame takes the sacred crown; Those sparkling eyes, that radiant face, Give to the diadem new grace: And subject to a Woman's laws, Darius sees, and smiles applause! He ceased, and silent still remain'd the throng, While rapt attention own'd the power of song. Then, loud as when the wintry whirlwinds blow, From every voice the thundering plaudits flow, Darius smiled, Apame's sparkling eyes Glanced on the King, and Woman won the prize. Now silent sate the expectant crowd: Alone The victor Hebrew gazed not on the throne; With deeper hue his cheek distemper'd glows, With statelier stature loftier now he rose; Heavenward he gazed, regardless of the throng, And pour'd with awful voice sublimer song. “Ancient of days! Eternal Truth! one hymn, One holier strain the Bard shall raise to Thee, Thee Powerful! Thee Benevolent! Thee Just! Friend! Father! All in all! . . The Vine's rich blood, The Monarch's might, and Woman's conquering charms, These shall we praise alone? . . O ye who sit Beneath your vine, and quaff at evening hour The healthful bowl, remember Him whose dews, Whose rains, whose sun, matured the growing fruit, Creator and Preserver! . . Reverence Him, O Thou who from thy throne dispensest life And death, for He hath delegated power, And thou shalt one day at the throne of God Render thy strict account! . . . And ye who gaze Enrapt on Beauty's fascinating form, Gaze on with love; and loving beauty, learn To shun abhorrent all the mental eye Beholds deform'd and foul; for so shall Love Climb to the source of goodness. God of Truth! All-Just! All-Mighty! I should ill deserve Thy noblest gift, the gift divine of song, If, so content with ear-deep melodies To please all-profitless, I did not pour Severer strains, . . of Truth.. eternal Truth, Unchanging Justice, universal Love. Such strains awake the Soul to loftiest thoughts; Such strains the blessed Spirits of the Good Waft, grateful incense, to the Halls of Heaven.” The dying notes still murmur'd on the string, When from his throne arose the raptured King. About to speak he stood, and waved his hand, And all expectant sate the obedient band. Then just and generous, thus the Monarch cries, “Be thine, Zorobabel, the well-earn'd prize. The purple robe of state thy form shall fold, The beverage sparkle in thy cup of gold, The golden couch, the car, and honour'd chain, Requite the merits of thy favour'd strain, And raised supreme the ennobled race among, Be call'd My Cousin for the victor song. Nor these alone the victor song shall bless, Ask what thou wilt, and what thou wilt possess.” “Fallen is Jerusalem!” the Hebrew cries, And patriot anguish fills his streaming eyes, “Hurl'd to the earth by Rapine's vengeful rod, Polluted lies the temple of our God; Far in a foreign land her sons remain, Hear the keen taunt, and drag the galling chain; In fruitless woe they wear the weary years, And steep the bread of bitterness in tears. O Monarch, greatest, mildest, best of men, Restore us to those ruin'd walls again! Allow us to rebuild that sacred dome, To live in liberty, and die at Home.” So spake Zorobabel.—Thus Woman's praise Avail'd again Jerusalem to raise, Call'd forth the sanction of the Despot's nod, And freed the Nation best beloved of God. Brixton Causeway, 1793. WAT TYLER; A DRAMA. ACT I. Scene. A Blacksmith's shop; Wat Tyler at work within; a May-pole before the door. SONG. Alice, Piers, &amp;c. Cheerful on this holiday, Welcome we the merry May. On every sunny hillock spread, The pale primrose lifts her head; Rich with sweets, the western gale Sweeps along the cowslip'd dale; Every bank, with violets gay, Smiles to welcome in the May. The linnet from the budding grove, Chirps her vernal song of love. The copse resounds the throstle's notes, On each wild gale sweet music floats; And melody from every spray, Welcomes in the merry May. Cheerful on this holiday, Welcome we the merry May. [Dance [During the dance, Tyler lays down his hammer, and sits mournfully down before the door. Hob Carter. Why so sad, neighbour?—do not these gay sports, This revelry of youth, recall the days When we too mingled in the revelry, And lightly tripping in the morris dance, Welcomed the merry month? Tyler. Ay, we were young, No cares had quell'd the heyday of the blood: We sported deftly in the April morning, Nor mark'd the black clouds gathering o'er our noon, Nor fear'd the storm of night. Hob. Beshrew me, Tyler, But my heart joys to see the imps so cheerful! Young, hale, and happy, why should they destroy These blessings by reflection Tyler. Look ye, neighbour— You have known me long. Hob. Since we were boys together And play'd at barley-brake, and danced the morris. Some five-and-twenty years! Tyler. Was not I young, And hale, and happy? Hob. Cheerful as the best. Tyler. Have not I been a staid, hard-working man? Up with the lark at labour; sober, honest, Of an unblemish'd character? Hob. Who doubts it? There's never a man in Essex bears a better. Tyler. And shall not these, though young, and hale, and happy, Look on with sorrow to the future hour? Shall not reflection poison all their pleasures? When I—the honest, staid, hard-working Tyler, Toil through the long course of the summer's day, Still toiling, yet still poor! when with hard labour Scarce can I furnish out my daily food, And age comes on to steal away my strength, And leave me poor and wretched! Why should this be? My youth was regular—my labour constant— I married an industrious, virtuous woman; Nor while I toil'd and sweated at the anvil, Sat she neglectful of her spinning-wheel. Hob! I have only six groats in the world, And they must soon by law be taken from me. Hob. Curse on these taxes—one succeeds another— Our ministers, panders of a king's will, Drain all our wealth away, waste it in revels, And lure, or force away our boys, who should be The props of our old age, to fill their armies, And feed the crows of France. Year follows year, And still we madly prosecute the war; Draining our wealth, distressing our poor peasants, Slaughtering our youths—and all to crown our chiefs With glory!—I detest the hell-sprung name. Tyler. What matters me who wears the crown of France? Whether a Richard or a Charles possess it? They reap the glory—they enjoy the spoil— We pay—we bleed! The sun would shine as cheerly, The rains of heaven as seasonably fall, Though neither of these royal pests existed. Hob. Nay, as for that we poor men should fare better; No legal robbers then should force away The hard-earn'd wages of our honest toil. The Parliament for ever cries more money, The service of the state demands more money; Just heaven! of what service is the state? Tyler. Oh, 'tis of vast importance! who should pay for The luxuries and riots of the court? Who should support the flaunting courtier's pride, Pay for their midnight revels, their rich garments, Did not the state enforce?—Think ye, my friend, That I, a humble blacksmith, here at Deptford, Would part with these six groats—earn'd by hard toil, All that I have! to massacre the Frenchmen, Murder as enemies men I never saw! Did not the state compel me? (Tax-gatherers pass by.) There they go, Privileged ruffians! [Piers &amp; Alice advance to him. Alice. Did we not dance it well to-day, my father? You know I always loved these village sports, Even from my infancy, and yet methinks I never tripp'd along the mead so gaily. You know they chose me queen, and your friend Piers Wreathed me this cowslip garland for my head— Is it not simple?—You are sad my father! You should have rested from your work to-day, And given a few hours up to merriment— But you are so serious! Tyler Serious, my good girl! I may well be so: when I look at thee It makes me sad! thou art too fair a flower To bear the wintry wind of poverty. Piers. Yet I have often heard you speak of riches Even with contempt; they cannot purchase peace, Or innocence, or virtue; sounder sleep Waits on the weary ploughman's lowly bed, Than on the downy couch of luxury Lulls the rich slave of pride and indolence. I never wish for wealth; my arm is strong, And I can purchase by it a coarse meal, And hunger savours it. Tyler. Young man, thy mind Has yet to learn the hard lesson of experience. Thou art yet young: the blasting breath of want Has not yet froze the current of thy blood. Piers. Fare not the birds well, as from spray to spray, Blithesome they bound, yet find their simple food Scatter'd abundantly? Tyler. No fancied boundaries of mine and thine Restrain their wanderings. Nature gives enough For all; but Man, with arrogant selfishness, Proud of his heaps, hoards up superfluous stores Robb'd from his weaker fellows, starves the poor, Or gives to pity what he owes to justice! Piers. So I have heard our good friend John Ball preach. Alice. My father, wherefore was John Ball imprison'd? Was he not charitable, good, and pious? I have heard him say that all mankind are brethren, And that like brethren they should love each other; Was not that doctrine pious? Tyler. Rank sedition— High treason, every syllable, my child! The priests cry out on him for heresy, The nobles all detest him as a rebel, And this good man, this minister of Christ, This man, the friend and brother of mankind, Lingers in the dark dungeon!—My dear Alice, Retire awhile. [Exit Alice. Piers, I would speak to thee, Even with a father's love! you are much with me, And I believe do court my conversation; Thou could'st not choose thee forth a truer friend. I would fain see thee happy, but I fear Thy very virtues will destroy thy peace. My daughter—she is young—not yet fifteen: Piers, thou art generous, and thy youthful heart Warm with affection; this close intimacy Will ere long grow to love. Piers. Suppose it so; Were that an evil, Walter? She is mild And cheerful, and industrious:—now methinks With such a partner life would be most happy! Why would ye warn me then of wretchedness? Is there an evil that can harm our lot? I have been told the virtuous must be happy, And have believed it true: tell me, my friend, What shall disturb the virtuous? Tyler. Poverty, A bitter foe. Piers. Nay, you have often told me That happiness does not consist in riches. Tyler. It is most true; but tell me, my dear boy, Could'st thou be happy to behold thy wife Pining with want? the children of your loves Clad in the squalid rags of wretchedness? And, when thy hard and unremitting toil Had earn'd with pain a scanty recompense, Could'st thou be patient when the law should rob thee And leave thee without bread and pennyless? Piers. It is a dreadful picture. Tyler. 'Tis a true one. Piers. But yet methinks our sober industry Might drive away the danger! 'tis but little That I could wish; food for our frugal meals, Raiment, however homely, and a bed To shield us from the night. Tyler. Thy honest reason Could wish no more: but were it not most wretched To want the coarse food for the frugal meal? And by the orders of your merciless lord, If you by chance were guilty of being poor, To be turn'd out adrift to the bleak world, Unhoused, unfriended?—Piers, I have not been idle, I never ate the bread of indolence; Could Alice be more thrifty than her mother? Yet with but one child,—and that one how good, Thou knowest,—I scarcely can provide the wants Of nature: look at these wolves of the law, They come to drain me of my hard-earn'd wages. I have already paid the heavy tax Laid on the wool that clothes me, on my leather, On all the needful articles of life! And now three groats (and I work'd hard to earn them) The Parliament demands—and I must pay them, Forsooth, for liberty to wear my head. [Enter Tax-gatherers. Collector. Three groats a head for all your family. Piers. Why is this money gather'd? 'tis a hard tax On the poor labourer! It can never be That Government should thus distress the people. Go to the rich for money—honest labour Ought to enjoy its fruits. Collector. The state wants money, War is expensive—'tis a glorious war, A war of honour, and must be supported.— Three groats a head. Tyler. There, three for my own head, Three for my wife's; what will the state tax next? Collector. You have a daughter. Tyler. She is below the age—not yet fifteen. Collector. You would evade the tax. Tyler. Sir Officer, I have paid you fairly what the law demands. [Alice and her mother enter the shop. The Taxgatherers go to her. One of them lays hold of her. She screams.—Tyler goes in. Collector. You say she's under age. [Alice screams again. Tyler knocks out the Taxgatherer's brains. His companions fly. Piers. A just revenge. Tyler. Most just indeed; but in the eye of the law 'Tis murder: and the murderer's lot is mine. [Piers goes out—Tyler sits down mournfully. Alice. Fly, my dear father! let us leave this place Before they raise pursuit. Tyler. Nay, nay, my child, Flight would be useless—I have done my duty; I have punish'd the brute insolence of lust, And here will wait my doom. Wife. Oh, let us fly, My husband, my dear husband! Alice. Quit but this place, And we may yet be safe, and happy too. Tyler. It would be useless, Alice; 'twould but lengthen A wretched life in fear. [Cry without, Liberty, Liberty! Enter Mob,Hob Carter, &amp;c. crying Liberty! Liberty! No Poll-tax! No War! Hob. We have broke our chains, we will arise in anger, The mighty multitude shall trample down The handful that oppress them. Tyler. Have ye heard So soon then of my murder? Hob. Of your vengeance. Piers ran throughout the village: told the news— Cried out, to arms!—arm, arm for liberty; For Liberty and Justice! Tyler. My good friends, Heed well your danger, or be resolute! Learn to laugh menaces and force to scorn, Or leave me. I dare answer the bold deed— Death must come once: return ye to your homes, Protect my wife and child, and on my grave Write why I died; perhaps the time may come, When honest Justice shall applaud the deed. Hob. Nay, nay, we are oppress'd, and have too long Knelt at our proud lords' feet; we have too long Obey'd their orders, bow'd to their caprices, Sweated for them the wearying summer's day, Wasted for them the wages of our toil, Fought for them, conquer'd for them, bled for them, Still to be trampled on, and still despised! But we have broke our chains. Tom Miller. Piers is gone on Through all the neighbouring villages, to spread The glorious tidings. Hob. He is hurried on To Maidstone, to deliver good John Ball, Our friend, our shepherd. [Mob increases. Tyler. Friends and Countrymen, Will ye then rise to save an honest man From the fierce clutches of the bloody law? Oh, do not call to mind my private wrongs, That the state drain'd my hard-earn'd pittance from me, That, of his office proud, the foul Collector Durst with lewd hand seize on my darling child, Insult her maiden modesty, and force A father's hand to vengeance; heed not this; Think not, my countrymen, on private wrongs, Remember what yourselves have long endured; Think of the insults, wrongs, and contumelies, Ye bear from your proud lords—that your hard toil Manures their fertile fields—you plough the earth, You sow the corn, you reap the ripen'd harvest,— They riot on the produce!—that, like beasts, They sell you with their land, claim all the fruits Which the kindly earth produces, as their own, The privilege, forsooth of noble birth! On, on to freedom; feel but your own strength, Be but resolved, and these destructive tyrants Shall shrink before your vengeance. Hob. On to London,— The tidings fly before us—the court trembles,— Liberty—Vengeance—Justice. ACT II. Scene I. Blackheath. Tyler, Hob, &amp;c.SONG. ‘When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?’ Wretched is the infant's lot, Born within the straw-roof'd cot; Be he generous, wise, or brave, He must only be a slave. Long, long labour, little rest, Still to toil to be oppress'd; Drain'd by taxes of his store, Punish'd next for being poor: This is the poor wretch's lot, Born within the straw-roof'd cot. While the peasant works,—to sleep, What the peasant sows,—to reap, On the couch of ease to lie, Rioting in revelry; Be he villain, be he fool, Still to hold despotic rule, Trampling on his slaves with scorn! This is to be nobly born. ‘When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?’ Jack Straw. The mob are up in London—the proud courtiers Begin to tremble. Tom Miller. Aye, aye, 'tis time to tremble: Who'll plough their fields, who'll do their drudgery now, And work like horses to give them the harvest? Jack Straw. I only wonder we lay quiet so long. We had always the same strength; and we deserved The ills we met with for not using it. Hob. Why do we fear those animals call'd lords? What is there in the name to frighten us? Is not my arm as mighty as a Baron's? Enter Piers and John Ball. Piers (to Tyler). Have I done well, my father?—I remember'd This good man lay in prison. Tyler. My dear child, Most well; the people rise for liberty, And their first deed should be to break the chains That bind the virtuous:—Oh, thou honest priest, How much hast thou endured! John Ball. Why, aye, my friend! These squalid rags bespeak what I have suffer'd. I was reviled, insulted, left to languish In a damp dungeon; but I bore it cheerily— My heart was glad—for I had done my duty. I pitied my oppressors, and I sorrow'd For the poor men of England. Tyler. They have felt Their strength: look round this heath; 'tis throng'd with men Ardent for freedom: mighty is the event That waits their fortune. John Ball. I would fain address them. Tyler. Do so, my friend, and preach to them their duty. Remind them of their long-withholden rights. What ho! there; silence! Piers. Silence, there, my friends, This good man would address you. Hob. Aye, aye, hear him; He is no mealy-mouth'd court-orator, To flatter vice, and pamper lordly pride. John Ball. Friends, brethren! for ye are my brethren all; Englishmen, met in arms to advocate The cause of freedom, hear me; pause awhile In the career of vengeance!—It is true I am a priest, but, as these rags may speak, Not one who riots in the poor man's spoil, Or trades with his religion. I am one Who preach the law of Christ; and, in my life, Would practise what he taught. The Son of God Came not to you in power: humble in mien, Lowly in heart, the man of Nazareth Preach'd mercy, justice, love: “Woe unto ye, Ye that are rich: if that ye would be saved Sell that ye have, and give unto the poor.” So taught the Saviour: Oh, my honest friends, Have ye not felt the strong indignant throb Of justice in your bosoms, to behold The lordly Baron feasting on your spoils? Have you not in your hearts arraign'd the lot That gave him on the couch of luxury To pillow his head, and pass the festive day In sportive feasts, and ease, and revelry? Have you not often in your conscience ask'd, Why is the difference; wherefore should that man, No worthier than myself, thus lord it over me, And bid me labour, and enjoy the fruits? The God within your breasts has argued thus: The voice of truth has murmur'd. Came ye not As helpless to the world? Shines not the sun With equal ray on both? Do ye not feel The self-same winds of heaven as keenly parch ye? Abundant is the earth—the Sire of all, Saw and pronounced that it was very good. Look round: the vernal fields smile with new flowers, The budding orchard perfumes the sweet breeze, And the green corn waves to the passing gale. There is enough for all; but your proud Baron Stands up, and, arrogant of strength, exclaims, “I am a Lord—by nature I am noble: These fields are mine, for I was born to them, I was born in the castle—you, poor wretches, Whelp'd in the cottage are by birth my slaves.” Almighty God! such blasphemies are utter'd: Almighty God! such blasphemies believed! Tom Miller. This is something like a sermon. Jack Straw. Where's the bishop Would tell you truths like these? Hob. There never was a bishop among all the apostles. John Ball. My brethren— Piers. Silence; the good priest speaks. John Ball. My brethren, these are truths, and weighty ones, Ye are all equal: nature made ye so. Equality is your birthright.—When I gaze On the proud palace, and behold one man In the blood purpled robes of royalty, Feasting at ease, and lording over millions, Then turn me to the hut of poverty, And see the wretched labourer worn with toil, Divide his scanty morsel with his infants, I sicken, and indignant at the sight, “Blush for the patience of humanity.” Jack Straw. We will assert our rights. Tom Miller. We'll trample down These insolent oppressors. John Ball. In good truth, Ye have cause for anger: but, my honest friends, Is it revenge or justice that ye seek? Mob. Justice! Justice! John Ball. Oh, then remember mercy; And though your proud oppressors spare not you, Show you excel them in humanity. They will use every art to disunite you; To conquer separately, by stratagem, Whom in a mass they fear;—but be ye firm; Boldly demand your long-forgotten rights, Your sacred, your inalienable freedom. Be bold—be resolute—be merciful: And while you spurn the hated name of slaves, Show you are men. Mob. Long live our honest priest. Jack Straw. He shall be made archbishop. John Ball. My brethren, I am plain John Ball, your friend, Your equal: by the law of Christ enjoin'd To serve you, not command. Jack Straw. March we for London. Tyler. Mark me, my friends—we rise for Liberty— Justice shall be our guide: let no man dare To plunder in the tumult. Mob. Lead us on. Liberty! Justice! [Exeunt, with cries of Liberty! No Poll-tax! No War. SCENE II. The Tower. King Richard, Archbishop of Canterbury, Sir John Tresilian, Walworth, Philpot. King. What must we do? the danger grows more imminent. The mob increases. Philpot. Every moment brings Fresh tidings of our peril. King. It were well To grant them what they ask. Archbishop. Aye, that my liege Were politic. Go boldly forth to meet them, Grant all they ask—however wild and ruinous— Meantime, the troops you have already summon'd Will gather round them. Then my Christian power Absolves you of your promise. Walworth. Were but their ringleaders cut off, the rabble Would soon disperse. Philpot. United in a mass, There's nothing can resist them—once divide them And they will fall an easy sacrifice. Archbishop. Lull them by promises—bespeak them fair. Go forth, my liege—spare not, if need requires A solemn oath to ratify the treaty. King. I dread their fury. Archbishop. 'Tis a needless dread, There is divinity about your person; It is the sacred privilege of Kings, Howe'er they act, to render no account To man. The people have been taught this lesson, Nor can they soon forget it. King. I will go— I will submit to everything they ask; My day of triumph will arrive at last. [Shouts without. Enter Messenger. Messenger. The mob are at the city gates. Archbishop. Haste! Haste! Address them ere too late. I'll remain here, For they detest me much. [Shouts again. Enter another Messenger. Mess. The Londoners have open'd the city gates; The rebels are admitted. King. Fear then must give me courage. My lord mayor, Come you with me. [Exeunt. Shouts without. SCENE III. Smithfield. Wat Tyler, John Ball, Piers, &amp;c. Mob. Piers. So far triumphant are we. How these nobles, These petty tyrants, who so long oppress'd us, Shrink at the first resistance. Hob. They were powerful Only because we fondly thought them so. Where is Jack Straw? Tyler. Jack Straw is gone to the Tower To seize the king, and so to end resistance. John Ball. It was well judged; fain would I spare the shedding Of human blood: gain we that royal puppet And all will follow fairly; deprived of him, The nobles lose their pretext, nor will dare Rebel against the people's majesty. Enter Herald. Herald. Richard the Second, by the grace of God, Of England, Ireland, France, and Scotland, King, And of the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Would parley with Wat Tyler. Tyler. Let him know Wat Tyler is in Smithfield. [Exit Herald.]—I will parley With this young monarch: as he comes to me, Trusting my honour, on your lives I charge you Let none attempt to harm him. John Ball. The faith of courts Is but a weak dependence. You are honest— And better is it even to die the victim Of credulous honesty, than live preserved By the cold policy that still suspects. Enter King, Walworth, Philpot, &amp;c. King. I would speak to thee, Wat Tyler: bid the mob Retire awhile. Piers. Nay, do not go alone— Let me attend you. Tyler. Wherefore should I fear? Am I not arm'd with a just cause? Retire, And I will boldly plead the cause of Freedom. [Advances. King. Tyler, why have you kill'd my officer, And led my honest subjects from their homes, Thus to rebel against the Lord's anointed? Tyler. Because they were oppress'd. King. Was this the way To remedy the ill? You should have tried By milder means—petition'd at the throne— The throne will always listen to petitions. Tyler. King of England, Petitioning for pity is most weak— The sovereign people ought to demand justice. I kill'd your officer, for his lewd hand Insulted a maid's modesty. Your subjects I lead to rebel against the Lord's anointed, Because his ministers have made him odious, His yoke is heavy, and his burden grievous. Why do we carry on this fatal war, To force upon the French a king they hate, Tearing our young men from their peaceful homes, Forcing his hard-earn'd fruits from the honest peasant, Distressing us to desolate our neighbours? Why is this ruinous poll-tax imposed, But to support your court's extravagance, And your mad title to the crown of France? Shall we sit tamely down beneath these evils Petitioning for pity? King of England, Why are we sold like cattle in your markets— Deprived of every privilege of man? Must we lie tamely at our tyrant's feet, And, like your spaniels, lick the hand that beats us? You sit at ease in your gay palaces, The costly banquet courts your appetite, Sweet music soothes your slumbers: we the while, Scarce by hard toil can earn a little food, And sleep scarce shelter'd from the cold night wind; Whilst your wild projects wrests the little from us Which might have cheer'd the wintry hour of age. The parliament for ever asks more money; We toil and sweat for money for your taxes: Where is the benefit, what good reap we From all the counsels of your government? Think you that we should quarrel with the French? What boots to us your victories, your glory: We pay, we fight, you profit at your ease. Do you not claim the country as your own? Do you not call the venison of the forest, The birds of heaven your own?—prohibiting us, Even though in want of food, to seize the prey Which nature offers. King! is all this just? Think you, we do not feel the wrongs we suffer? The hour of retribution is at hand, And tyrants tremble—mark me, King of England Walworth—(comes behind him, and stabs him.) Insolent rebel, threatening the King! Piers. Vengeance! Vengeance! Hob. Seize the King. King. I must be bold. (Advancing) My friends and loving subjects, I will grant you all you ask; you shall be free— The tax shall be repeal'd—all, all you wish. Your leader menaced me, he deserv'd his fate. Quiet your angers: on my royal word Your grievances shall all be done away; Your vassalage abolish'd. A free pardon Allow'd to all: So help me God, it shall be. John Ball. Revenge, my brethren, beseems not Christians: Send us these terms, sign'd with your seal of state. We will await in peace. Deceive us not— Act justly, so to excuse your late foul deed. King. The charter shall be drawn out: on mine honour All shall be justly done. ACT III. Scene I. Smithfield. John Ball, Piers, &amp;c. Piers. (to John Ball.) You look disturbed, my father. John Ball. Piers, I am so. Jack Straw has forced the Tower: seiz'd the Archbishop, And beheaded him. Piers. The curse of insurrection. John Ball. Aye, Piers, our nobles level down their vassals, Keep them at endless labour, like their brutes, Degrading every faculty by servitude, Repressing all the energy of mind: We must not wonder, then, that, like wild beasts, When they have burst their chains, with brutal rage They revenge them on their tyrants. Piers. This Archbishop, He was oppressive to his humble vassals: Proud, haughty, avaricious— John Ball. A true high priest, Preaching humility with his mitre on; Praising up alms and Christian charity, Even whilst his unforgiving hand distress'd His honest tenants. Piers. He deserved his fate, then. John Ball. Justice can never link with cruelty. Is there among the catalogue of crimes A sin so black that only Death can expiate? Will Reason never rouse her from her slumbers, And darting through the veil her eagle eye, See in the sable garments of the law Revenge conceal'd? This high priest has been haughty, He has oppress'd his vassals: tell me, Piers, Does his death remedy the ills he caused? Were it not better to repress his power Of doing wrong, that so his future life Might remedy the evils of the past, And benefit mankind? Piers. But must not vice Be punish'd? John Ball. Is not punishment revenge? The momentary violence of anger May be excused: the indignant heart will throb Against oppression, and the outstretch'd arm Resent its injured feelings. The Collector Insulted Alice, and roused the keen emotions Of a fond father. Tyler murder'd him. Piers. Murder'd!—a most harsh word. John Ball. Yes, murder'd him: His mangled feelings prompted the bad act, And Nature will almost commend the deed That Justice blames: but will the awaken'd feelings Plead with their heart-emoving eloquence For the calm deliberate murder of Revenge? Would you, Piers, in your calmer hour of reason, Condemn an erring brother to be slain? Cut him at once from all the joys of life, All hopes of reformation—to revenge The deed his punishment cannot recall? My blood boil'd in me at the fate of Tyler, Yet I reveng'd not. Piers. Oh, my Christian father, They would not argue thus humanely on us, Were we within their power. John Ball. I know they would not; But we must pity them that they are vicious, Nor imitate their vice. Piers. Alas, poor Tyler! I do repent me much that I stood back, When he advanced, fearless in rectitude, To meet these royal assassins. John Ball. Not for myself, Though I have lost an honest virtuous friend, Mourn I the death of Tyler: he was one Gifted with the strong energy of mind, Quick to perceive the right, and prompt to act When Justice needed: he would listen to me With due attention, yet not yielding lightly What had to him seem'd good: severe in virtue, He awed the ruder people, whom he led, By his stern rectitude. Piers. Witness that day When they destroy'd the palace of the Gaunt; And hurl'd the wealth his avarice had amass'd, Amid the fire: the people, fierce in zeal, Threw in the flames a wretch whose selfish hand Purloin'd amid the tumult. John Ball. I lament The death of Tyler for my country's sake. I shudder lest posterity enslaved, Should rue his murder. Who shall now controul The giddy multitude, blind to their own good, And listening with avidity to the tale Of courtly falsehood. Piers. The King must perform His plighted promise. (Cry without.— The Charter;—the Charter.) Enter Mob and Herald. Tom Miller. Read it out—read it out. Hob. Aye, aye, let's hear the Charter. Herald. Richard Plantagenet, by the grace of God, King of England, Ireland, France, Scotland, and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, to all whom it may concern,—These presents: Whereas our loving subjects have complained to us of the heavy burdens they endure, particularly from our late enacted poll-tax; and whereas they have risen in arms against our officers, and demanded the abolition of personal slavery, vassalage and manorial rights; we, ever ready in our sovereign mercy to listen to the petitions of our loving subjects, do annul all these grievances. Mob. Huzza! long live the King. Herald (continues). And do of our royal mercy grant a free pardon to all who may have been anyways concerned in the late insurrections. All this shall be faithfully performed on our royal word, so help us God.—God save the King. [Loud and repeated shouts. Herald. Now then depart in quiet to your homes. John Ball. Nay, my good friend, the people will remain Embodied peaceably, till parliament Confirm the royal Charter: tell your King so: We will await the Charter's confirmation, Meanwhile comporting ourselves orderly, As peaceful citizens, not risen in tumult, But to redress their evils. [Exit Herald, &amp;c. Hob. 'Twas well ordered. I place but little trust in courtly faith. John Ball. We must remain embodied; else the King Will plunge again in royal luxury, And when the storm of danger is past over, Forget his promises. Hob. Aye, like an aguish sinner, He'll promise to repent, when the fit's on him, When well recover'd, laugh at his own terrors. Piers. Oh I am grieved that we must gain so little. Why are not all these empty ranks abolish'd, King, slave, and lord, ennobled into MAN. Are we not equal all?—have you not told me Equality is the sacred right of man, Inalienable, though by force withheld? John Ball. Even so: but, Piers, my frail and fallible judgement Knows hardly to decide if it be right, Peaceably to return, content with little, With this half restitution of our rights, Or boldly to proceed, through blood and slaughter, Till we should all be equal and all happy. I chose the milder way:—perhaps I err'd! Piers. I fear me! By the mass, the unsteady people Are flocking homewards—how the multitude Diminishes! John Ball. Go thou, my son, and stay them. Carter, do you exert your influence, All depends upon their stay: my mind is troubled, And I would fain compose my thoughts for action. [Exeunt Hob and Piers. Father of mercies! I do fear me much That I have err'd. Thou gavest my ardent mind To pierce the mists of superstitious falsehood;— Gavest me to know the truth. I should have urged it Through every opposition; now, perhaps, The seemly voice of pity has deceived me And all this mighty movement ends in ruin. I fear me I have been like the weak leech, Who, sparing to cut deep, with cruel mercy Mangles his patient without curing him. [Great tumult. What means this tumult? hark! the clang of arms. God of eternal justice—the false monarch Has broke his plighted vow. [Enter Piers wounded. Piers. Fly, fly, my father—the perjured King,—fly, fly. John Ball. Nay, nay, my child; I dare abide my fate. Let me bind up thy wounds. Piers. 'Tis useless succour. They seek thy life; fly, fly, my honoured father, And let me have the hope to sweeten death That thou at least hast 'scaped. They are murdering Our unsuspecting brethren: half unarm'd, Trusting too fondly to the tyrant's word, They were dispersing:—the streets swim with blood. Oh, save thyself. [Enter soldiers. 1st Soldier. This is that old seditious heretic. 2d Soldier. And here the young spawn of rebellion; My orders ar'n't to spare him. [Stabs Piers. Come, you old stirrer-up of insurrection, You bell-wether of the mob—you ar'n't to die So easily. [Leading him off. (Mob fly across the stage—the troops pursue them— tumult increases—loud cries and shouts. SCENE II. Westminster Hall. King, Walworth, Philpot, Sir John Tresilian, &amp;c. Walworth. My liege, 'twas wisely ordered, to destroy The dunghill rabble, but take prisoner That old seditious priest: his strange wild notions Of this equality, when well exposed, Will create ridicule, and shame the people Of their late tumults. Sir John. Aye, there's nothing like A fair, free, open trial, where the King Can choose his jury and appoint his judges. King. Walworth, I must thank you for my deliverance, 'Twas a bold deed to stab him in the parley. Kneel down, and rise a knight, Sir William Walworth. Enter Messenger. Messenger. I left them hotly at it. Smithfield smoked With the rebels' blood! your troops fought loyally, There's not a man of them will lend an ear To pity. Walworth. Is John Ball secured? Messanger. They have seized him. Enter Guards, with John Ball. 1st Guard. We've brought the old villain. 2d Guard. An old mischief maker— Why there's fifteen hundred of the mob are killed, All through his preaching. Sir John Tr. Prisoner, are you the arch-rebel John Ball? John Ball. I am John Ball; but I am not a rebel. Take ye the name, who, arrogant in strength, Rebel against the people's sovereignty. Sir John Tr. John Ball, you are accused of stirring up The poor deluded people to rebellion; Not having the fear of God and of the King Before your eyes; of preaching up strange notions, Heretical and treasonous; such as saying That kings have not a right from Heaven to govern; That all mankind are equal; and that rank. And the distinctions of society, Aye, and the sacred rights of property, Are evil and oppressive; plead you guilty To this most heavy charge? John Ball. If it be guilt, To preach what you are pleased to call strange notions, That all mankind as brethren must be equal; That privileged orders of society Are evil and oppressive; that the right Of property is a juggle to deceive The poor whom you oppress; I plead me guilty. Sir John Tr. It is against the custom of this court That the prisoner should plead guilty. John Ball. Why then put you The needless question? Sir Judge, let me save The vain and empty insult of a trial. What I have done, that I dare justify. Sir John Tr. Did you not tell the mob they were oppress'd; And preach upon the equality of man; With evil intent thereby to stir them up To tumult and rebellion? John Ball. That I told them That all mankind are equal, is most true: Ye came as helpless infants to the world; Ye feel alike the infirmities of nature; And at last moulder into common clay. Why then these vain distinctions?—bears not the earth Food in abundance?—must your granaries O'erflow with plenty, while the poor man starves? Sir Judge, why sit you there, clad in your furs; Why are your cellars stored with choicest wines? Your larders hung with dainties, while your vassal, As virtuous, and as able too by nature, Though by your selfish tyranny deprived Of mind's improvement, shivers in his rags, And starves amid the plenty he creates. I have said this is wrong, and I repeat it— And there will be a time when this great truth Shall be confess'd—be felt by all mankind. The electric truth shall run from man to man, And the blood-cemented pyramid of greatness Shall fall before the flash. Sir John Tr. Audacious rebel; How darest thou insult this sacred court, Blaspheming all the dignities of rank? How could the Government be carried on Without the sacred orders of the King And the nobility. John Ball. Tell me, Sir Judge, What does the Government avail the peasant? Would not he plough his field, and sow the corn, Aye, and in peace enjoy the harvest too? Would not the sun shine and the dews descend, Though neither King nor Parliament existed? Do your court politics ought matter him? Would he be warring even unto death With his French neighbours? Charles and Richard contend, The people fight and suffer:—think ye, Sirs, If neither country had been cursed with a chief, The peasants would have quarrell'd? King. This is treason! The patience of the court has been insulted— Condemn the foul-mouth'd, contumacious rebel. Sir John Tr. John Ball, whereas you are accused before us, Of stirring up the people to rebellion, And preaching to them strange and dangerous doctrines; And whereas your behaviour to the court Has been most insolent and contumacious; Insulting Majesty—and since you have pleaded Guilty to all these charges; I condemn you To death: you shall be hanged by the neck, But not till you are dead—your bowels open'd— Your heart torn out, and burnt before your face— Your traitorous head be severed from your body— Your body quarter'd, and exposed upon The city gates—a terrible example— And the Lord God have mercy on your soul. John Ball. Why, be it so. I can smile at your vengeance, For I am arm'd with rectitude of soul. The truth, which all my life I have divulged, And am now doom'd in torments to expire for, Shall still survive. The destined hour must come, When it shall blaze with sun-surpassing splendour, And the dark mists of prejudice and falsehood Fade in its strong effulgence. Flattery's incense No more shall shadow round the gore-dyed throne; That altar of oppression, fed with rites, More savage than the priests of Moloch taught, Shall be consumed amid the fire of Justice; The rays of truth shall emanate around, And the whole world be lighted. King. Drag him hence: Away with him to death; order the troops Now to give quarter, and make prisoners— Let the blood-reeking sword of war be sheathed, That the law may take vengeance on the rebels. POEMS CONCERNING THE SLAVE TRADE. SONNET I. [Hold your mad hands! for ever on your plain] Hold your mad hands! for ever on your plain Must the gorged vulture clog his beak with blood? For ever must your Niger's tainted flood, Roll to the ravenous shark his banquet slain? Hold your mad hands! and learn at length to know, And turn your vengeance on the common foe, Yon treacherous vessel and her godless crew! Let never traders with false pretext fair Set on your shores again their wicked feet: With interdict and indignation meet Repel them, and with fire and sword pursue! Avarice, the white cadaverous fiend, is there, Who spreads his toils accursed wide and far, And for his purveyor calls the demon War. SONNET II. [Why dost thou beat thy breast and rend thine hair] Why dost thou beat thy breast and rend thine hair, And to the deaf sea pour thy frantic cries? Before the gale the laden vessel flies; The Heavens all-favouring smile, the breeze is fair; Hark to the clamours of the exulting crew! Hark how their cannon mock the patient skies! Why dost thou shriek, and strain thy red-swoln eyes, As the white sail is lessening from thy view? Go pine in want and anguish and despair, There is no mercy found in human-kind! Go, Widow, to thy grave, and rest thee there! But may the God of Justice bid the wind Whelm that curst bark beneath the mountain wave, And bless with liberty and death the Slave! SONNET III. [Oh, he is worn with toil! the big drops run] Oh, he is worn with toil! the big drops run Down his dark cheek; hold—hold thy merciless hand, Pale tyrant! for beneath thy hard command O'erwearied nature sinks. The scorching sun, As pitiless as proud Prosperity, Darts on him his full beams; gasping he lies Arraigning with his looks the patient skies, While that inhuman driver lifts on high The mangling scourge. O ye who at your ease Sip the blood-sweeten'd beverage, thoughts like these Haply ye scorn: I thank thee, gracious God, That I do feel upon my cheek the glow Of indignation, when beneath the rod A sable brother writhes in silent woe. SONNET IV. ['Tis night; the unrelenting owners sleep] 'Tis night; the unrelenting owners sleep As undisturb'd as Justice; but no more The o'erwearied slave, as on his native shore, Rests on his reedy couch: he wakes to weep. Though through the toil and anguish of the day No tear escaped him, not one suffering groan Beneath the twisted thong, he weeps alone In bitterness; thinking that far away While happy Negroes join the midnight song, And merriment resounds on Niger's shore, She whom he loves, far from the cheerful throng Stands sad, and gazes from her lowly door With dim-grown eye, silent and woe-begone, And weeps for him who will return no more. SONNET V. [Did then the Negro rear at last the sword] Did then the Negro rear at last the sword Of vengeance? Did he plunge its thirsty blade In the hard heart of his inhuman lord? Oh! who shall blame him? in the midnight shade There came on him the intolerable thought Of every past delight; his native grove, Friendship's best joys, and liberty and love, For ever lost. Such recollections wrought His brain to madness. Wherefore should he live Longer with abject patience to endure His wrongs and wretchedness, when hope can give No consolation, time can bring no cure? But justice for himself he yet could take, And life is then well given for vengeance' sake. SONNET VI. [High in the air exposed the slave is hung] High in the air exposed the slave is hung, To all the birds of heaven, their living food! He groans not, though awaked by that fierce sun New torturers live to drink their parent blood; He groans not, though the gorging vulture tear The quivering fibre. Hither look, O ye Who tore this man from peace and liberty! Look hither, ye who weigh with politic care The gain against the guilt! Beyond the grave There is another world! . . bear ye in mind, Ere your decree proclaims to all mankind The gain is worth the guilt, that there the Slave, Before the Eternal, “thunder-tongued shall plead Against the deep damnation of your deed.” Bristol, 1794. TO THE GENIUS OF AFRICA. O thou, who from the mountain's height Rollest thy clouds with all their weight Of waters to old Nile's majestic tide; Or o'er the dark sepulchral plain Recallest Carthage in her ancient pride, The mistress of the Main; Hear, Genius, hear thy children's cry! Not always should'st thou love to brood Stern o'er the desert solitude Where seas of sand heave their hot surges high; Nor, Genius, should the midnight song Detain thee in some milder mood The palmy plains among, Where Gambia to the torches' light Flows radiant through the awaken'd night. Ah, linger not to hear the song! Genius, avenge thy children's wrong! The demon Avarice on your shore Brings all the horrors of his train, And hark! where from the field of gore Howls the hyena o'er the slain! Lo! where the flaming village fires the skies Avenging Power, awake! arise! Arise, thy children's wrongs redress! Heed the mother's wretchedness, When in the hot infectious air O'er her sick babe she bows opprest, . . Hear her when the Traders tear The suffering infant from her breast! Sunk in the ocean he shall rest! Hear thou the wretched mother's cries, Avenging Power! awake! arise! By the rank infected air That taints those cabins of despair; By the scourges blacken'd o'er, And stiff and hard with human gore; By every groan of deep distress, By every curse of wretchedness; The vices and the crimes that flow From the hopelessness of woe; By every drop of blood bespilt, By Afric's wrongs and Europe's guilt, Awake! arise! avenge! And thou hast heard! and o'er their blood-fed plains Sent thine avenging hurricanes And bade thy storms with whirlwind roar Dash their proud navies on the shore; And where their armies claim'd the fight Wither'd the warrior's might; And o'er the unholy host with baneful breath, There, Genius, thou hast breathed the gales of Death. Bristol, 1795. THE SAILOR, WHO HAD SERVED IN THE SLAVE TRADE. In September, 1798, a Dissenting Minister of Bristol discovered a sailor in the neighbourhood of that City, groaning and praying in a cow-house. The circumstance which occasioned his agony of mind is detailed in the annexed ballad, without the slightest addition or alteration. By presenting it as a Poem the story is made more public, and such stories ought to be made as public as possible. It was a Christian minister, Who, in the month of flowers, Walk'd forth at eve amid the fields Near Bristol's ancient towers; When from a lonely out-house breathed, He heard a voice of woe, And groans which less might seem from pain, Than wretchedness to flow; Heart-rending groans they were, with words Of bitterest despair, Yet with the holy name of Christ Pronounced in broken prayer. The Christian minister went in, A Sailor there he sees, Whose hands were lifted up to Heaven, And he was on his knees. Nor did the Sailor so intent His entering footsteps heed, But now “Our Father” said, and now His half-forgotten creed; And often on our Saviour call'd With many a bitter groan, But in such anguish as may spring From deepest guilt alone. The miserable man was ask'd Why he was kneeling there, And what had been the crime that caused The anguish of his prayer? “I have done a cursed thing!” he cried, “It haunts me night and day, And I have sought this lonely place Here undisturb'd to pray. Aboard I have no place for prayer, So I came here alone, That I might freely kneel and pray, And call on Christ, and groan. If to the main-mast head I go, The Wicked One is there; From place to place, from rope to rope, He follows every where. I shut my eyes.. it matters not.. Still, still the same I see, . . And when I lie me down at night, 'Tis always day with me! He follows, follows every where, And every place is Hell! O God.. and I must go with Him In endless fire to dwell! He follows, follows every where, He's still above.. below! Oh, tell me where to fly from him! Oh, tell me where to go!” “But tell thou,” quoth the stranger then, What this thy crime hath been, So haply I may comfort give To one who grieves for sin.” “O cursed, cursed is the deed!” The wretched man replies, “And night and day and every where 'Tis still before my eyes. I sail'd on board a Guinea-man, And to the slave-coast went; . . Would that the sea had swallow'd me When I was innocent! And we took in our cargo there, There hundred negro slaves, And we sail'd homeward merrily Over the ocean-waves. But some were sulky of the slaves, And would not touch their meat, So therefore we were forced by threats And blows to make them eat. One woman, sulkier than the rest, Would still refuse her food, . . . O Jesus God! I hear her cries! I see her in her blood! The captain made me tie her up, And flog while he stood by; And then he cursed me if I staid My hand to hear her cry. She shriek'd, she groan'd, . . I could not spare, For the Captain he stood by; . . . Dear God! that I might rest one night From that poor creature's cry! What woman's child a sight like that Could bear to look upon! And still the Captain would not spare.. But made me still flog on. She could not be more glad than I When she was taken down: A blessed minute! . . 'twas the last That I have ever known! I did not close my eyes all night, Thinking what I had done; I heard her groans, and they grew faint Towards the rising sun. She groan'd and moan'd, but her voice grew Fainter at morning tide; Fainter and fainter still it came Until at noon she died. They flung her overboard; . . poor wretch She rested from her pain, . . But when.. O Christ! O blessed God! Shall I have rest again! I saw the sea close over her Yet she is still in sight; I see her twisting every where; I hear her day and night. Go where I will, do what I can, The Wicked One I see: Dear Christ, have mercy on my soul! O God, deliver me! Oh give me comfort, if you can! Oh tell me where to fly! Oh tell me if there can be hope For one so lost as I!” What said the Minister of Christ? He bade him trust in Heaven, And call on Him for whose dear sake All sins shall be forgiven. He told him of that precious blood Which should his guilt efface; Told him that none are lost, but they Who turn from proffer'd grace. He bade him pray, and knelt with him, And join'd him in his prayers: . . . And some who read the dreadful tale Perhaps will aid with theirs. Westbury, 1798. VERSES SPOKEN IN THE THEATRE AT OXFORD, UPON THE INSTALLATION OF LORD GRENVILLE. Grenville, few years have had their course, since last Exulting Oxford view'd a spectacle Like this day's pomp; and yet to those who throng'd These walls, which echo'd then with Portland's praise, What change hath intervened! The bloom of spring Is fled from many a cheek, where roseate joy And beauty bloom'd; the inexorable Grave Hath claim'd its portion; and the band of youths, Who then, collected here as in a port From whence to launch on life's adventurous sea, Stood on the beach, ere this have found their lots Of good or evil. Thus the lapse of years, Evolving all things in its quiet course, Hath wrought for them; and though those years have seen Fearful vicissitudes, of wilder change Than history yet had learnt, or old romance In wildest mood imagined, yet these too, Portentous as they seem, not less have risen Each of its natural cause the sure effect, All righteously ordain'd. Lo! kingdoms wreck'd, Thrones overturn'd, built up, then swept away Like fabrics in the summer clouds, dispersed By the same breath that heap'd them; rightful kings, Who, from a line of long-drawn ancestry Held the transmitted sceptre, to the axe Bowing the anointed head; or dragg'd away To eat the bread of bondage; or escaped Beneath the shadow of Britannia's shield, There only safe. Such fate have vicious courts, Statesmen corrupt, and fear-struck policy, Upon themselves drawn down; till Europe, bound In iron chains, lies bleeding in the dust, Beneath the feet of upstart tyranny: Only the heroic Spaniard, he alone Yet unsubdued in these degenerate days, With desperate virtue, such as in old time Hallow'd Saguntum and Numantia's name, Stands up against the oppressor undismay'd. So may the Almighty bless the noble race, And crown with happy end their holiest cause! Deem not these dread events the monstrous birth Of chance! And thou, O England, who dost ride Serene amid the waters of the flood, Preserving, even like the Ark of old, Amid the general wreck, thy purer faith, Domestic loves, and ancient liberty, Look to thyself, O England! for be sure, Even to the measure of thine own desert, The cup of retribution to thy lips Shall soon or late be dealt! . . a thought that well Might fill the stoutest heart of all thy sons With aweful apprehension. Therefore, they Who fear the Eternal's justice, bless thy name, Grenville, because the wrongs of Africa Cry out no more to draw a curse from Heaven On England!—for if still the trooping sharks Track by the scent of death the accursed ship Freighted with human anguish, in her wake Pursue the chace, crowd round her keel, and dart Toward the sound contending, when they hear The frequent carcass from her guilty deck Dash in the opening deep, no longer now The guilt shall rest on England; but if yet There be among her children, hard of heart And sear'd of conscience, men who set at nought Her laws and God's own word, upon themselves Their sin be visited! . . the red-cross flag, Redeem'd from stain so foul, no longer now Covereth the abomination. This thy praise, O Grenville, and while ages roll away This shall be thy remembrance. Yea, when all For which the tyrant of these abject times Hath given his honourable name on earth, His nights of innocent sleep, his hopes of heaven; When all his triumphs and his deeds of blood, The fretful changes of his feverish pride, His midnight murders and perfidious plots, Are but a tale of years so long gone by, That they who read distrust the hideous truth, Willing to let a charitable doubt Abate their horror; Grenville, even then Thy memory will be fresh among mankind Afric with all her tongues will speak of thee, With Wilberforce and Clarkson, he whom Heaven, To be the apostle of this holy work, Raised up and strengthen'd, and upheld through all His arduous toil. To end the glorious task, That blessed, that redeeming deed was thine: Be it thy pride in life, thy thought in death, Thy praise beyond the tomb. The statesman's fame Will fade, the conqueror's laurel crown grow sere; Fame's loudest trump upon the ear of Time Leaves but a dying echo; they alone Are held in everlasting memory, Whose deeds partake of heaven. Long ages hence Nations unborn, in cities that shall rise Along the palmy coast, will bless thy name; And Senegal and secret Niger's shore, And Calabar, no longer startled then With sounds of murder, will, like Isis now, Ring with the songs that tell of Grenville's praise. Keswick, 1810. BOTANY-BAY ECLOGUES. Where a sight shall shuddering sorrow find, Sad as the ruins of the human mind.— Bowles. I. ELINOR. Time, Morning. Scene, The Shore. Once more to daily toil, once more to wear The livery of shame, once more to search With miserable task this savage shore! O thou, who mountest so triumphantly In yonder Heaven, beginning thy career Of glory, O thou blessed Sun! thy beams Fall on me with the same benignant light Here, at the farthest limits of the world, And blasted as I am with infamy, As when in better years poor Elinor Gazed on thy glad uprise with eye undimm'd By guilt and sorrow, and the opening morn Woke her from quiet sleep to days of peace. In other occupation then I trod The beach at eve; and then when I beheld The billows as they roll'd before the storm Burst on the rock and rage, my timid soul Shrunk at the perils of the boundless deep, And heaved a sigh for suffering mariners; . . . Ah! little thinking I myself was doom'd To tempt the perils of the boundless deep, An outcast, unbeloved and unbewail'd. Still wilt thou haunt me, Memory! still present The fields of England to my exiled eyes, The joys which once were mine. Even now I see The lowly lovely dwelling; even now Behold the woodbine clasping its white walls, Where fearlessly the red-breasts chirp'd around To ask their morning meal: and where at eve I loved to sit and watch the rook sail by, And hear his hollow tone, what time he sought The church-yard elm, that with its ancient boughs Full-foliaged, half-conceal'd the house of God; That holy house, where I so oft have heard My father's voice explain the wonderous works Of Heaven to sinful man. Ah! little deem'd His virtuous bosom, that his shameless child So soon should spurn the lesson, . . sink, the slave Of Vice and Infamy, . . the hireling prey Of brutal appetite;—at length worn out With famine, and the avenging scourge of guilt, Should share dishonesty,—yet dread to die! Welcome, ye savage lands, ye barbarous climes, Where angry England sends her outcast sons, I hail your joyless shores! My weary bark, Long tempest-tost on Life's inclement sea, Here hails her haven; welcomes the drear scene, The marshy plain, the briar-entangled wood, And all the perils of a world unknown. For Elinor has nothing new to fear From cruel Fortune; all her rankling shafts Barb'd with disgrace, and venom'd with disease, Have pierced my bosom, and the dart of death Has lost its terrors to a wretch like me. Welcome, ye marshy heaths, ye pathless woods, Where the rude native rests his wearied frame Beneath the sheltering shade; where, when the storm Benumbs his naked limbs, he flies to seek The dripping shelter. Welcome, ye wild plains Unbroken by the plough, undelved by hand Of patient rustic; where for lowing herds, And for the music of the bleating flocks, Alone is heard the kangaroo's sad note Deepening in distance. Welcome, wilderness, Nature's domain! for here, as yet unknown The comforts and the crimes of polish'd life, Nature benignly gives to all enough, Denies to all a superfluity. What though the garb of infamy I wear, Though day by day along the echoing beach I gather wave-worn shells; yet day by day I earn in honesty my frugal food, And lay me down at night to calm repose; No more condemned, the mercenary tool Of brutal lust, while heaves the indignant heart Abhorrent, and self-loathed, to fold my arms Round the rank felon, and for daily bread To hug contagion to my poison'd breast! On these wild shores the saving hand of Grace Will probe my secret soul, and cleanse its wounds, And fit the faithful penitent for Heaven. Oxford, 1794. II. HUMPHREY AND WILLIAM. Time, Noon. HUMPHREY. See'st thou not, William, that the scorching sun By this time half his daily race hath run? The savage thrusts his light canoe to shore, And hurries homeward with his fishy store. Suppose we leave awhile this stubborn soil, To eat our dinner and to rest from toil. WILLIAM. Agreed. Yon tree, whose purple gum bestows A ready medicine for the sick man's woes, Forms with its shadowy boughs a cool retreat To shield us from the noontide's sultry heat. Ah, Humphrey! now upon old England's shore The weary labourer's morning work is o'er. The woodman there rests from his measured stroke, Flings down his axe, and sits beneath the oak; Savour'd with hunger there he eats his food, There drinks the cooling streamlet of the wood. To us no cooling streamlet winds its way, No joys domestic crown for us the day; The felon's name, the outcast's garb we wear, Toil all the day, and all the night despair. HUMPHREY. Aye, William! labouring up the furrow'd ground, I used to love the village clock's old sound, Rejoice to hear my morning toil was done, And trudge it homeward when the clock went one. 'Twas ere I turn'd a soldier and a sinner! Pshaw! curse this whining—let us fall to dinner. WILLIAM. I too have loved this hour, nor yet forgot The household comforts of my little cot; For at this hour my wife with watchful care Was wont her humble dainties to prepare; The keenest sauce by hunger was supplied, And my poor children prattled at my side. Methinks I see the old oak table spread, The clean white trencher and the good brown bread: The cheese, my daily fare, which Mary made, For Mary knew full well the housewife's trade; The jug of cyder,—cyder I could make;— And then the knives,—I won 'em at the wake. Another has them now! I toiling here Look backward like a child, and drop a tear. HUMPHREY. I love a dismal story: tell me thine, Meantime, good Will, I'll listen as I dine; I too, my friend, can tell a piteous story When I turn'd hero how I purchased glory. WILLIAM. But, Humphrey, sure thou never canst have known The comforts of a little home thine own: A home so snug, so cheerful too, as mine, 'Twas always clean, and we could make it fine. For there King Charles's Golden Rules were seen, And there—God bless'em both! the King and Queen. The pewter plates, our garnish'd chimney's grace, So bright, that in them you might see your face; And over all, to frighten thieves, was hung, Well clean'd, although but seldom used, my gun, Ah! that damn'd gun! I took it down one morn, . . A desperate deal of harm they did my corn! Our testy Squire, too, loved to save the breed, So covey upon covey ate my seed. I mark'd the mischievous rogues, and took my aim; I fired, they fell, and... up the keeper came. That cursed morning brought on my undoing; I went to prison, and my farm to ruin. Poor Mary! for her grave the parish paid, No tomb-stone tells where her remains are laid! My children.. my poor boys.. HUMPHREY. Come! . . grief is dry... You to your dinner; . . to my story I. For you, my friend, who happier days have known, And each calm comfort of a home your own, This is bad living: I have spent my life In hardest toil and unavailing strife, And here, (from forest ambush safe at least,) To me this scanty pittance seems a feast. I was a plough-boy once, as free from woes And blithesome as the lark with whom I rose. Each evening at return a meal I found; And though my bed was hard, my sleep was sound. One Whitsuntide, to go to fair I drest Like a great bumpkin in my Sunday's best; A primrose posey in my hat I stuck, And to the revel went to try my luck. From show to show, from booth to booth I stray, See, stare, and wonder all the live-long day. A sergeant to the fair recruiting came, Skill'd in man-catching, to beat up for game; Our booth he enter'd and sat down by me; . . Methinks even now the very scene I see! The canvass roof, the hogshead s running store, The old blind fiddler seated next the door, The frothy tankard passing to and fro, And the rude rabble round the puppet-show. The sergeant eyed me well; the punch-bowl comes, And as we laugh'd and drank, up struck the drums. And now he gives a bumper to his wench, God save the King! and then, God damn the French! Then tells the story of his last campaign, How many wounded and how many slain, Flags flying, cannons roaring, drums a-beating, The English marching on, the French retreating... “Push on.. push on, my lads! they fly before ye, March on to riches, happiness, and glory!” At first I wonder'd, by degrees grew bolder, Then cried, “'Tis a fine thing to be a soldier!” “Aye, Humphrey!” says the sergeant, . . “that's your name? Tis a fine thing to fight the French for fame! March to the field, . . knock out a Mounseer's brains, And pick the scoundrel's pocket for your pains. Come, Humphrey, come! thou art a lad of spirit; Rise to a halbert, as I did, . . by merit! Wouldst thou believe it? even I was once As thou art now, a plough-boy and a dunce; But courage raised me to my rank. How now, boy! Shall Hero Humphrey still be Numps the ploughboy? A proper-shaped young fellow! tall and straight! Why, thou wert made for glory! . . five feet eight! The road to riches is the field of fight! . . Didst ever see a guinea look so bright? Why regimentals, Numps, would give thee grace, A hat and feather would become that face; The girls would crowd around thee to be kiss'd! . . Dost love a girl?”—“OddZounds!” I cried, “I'll list!” So pass'd the night; anon the morning came, And off I set a volunteer for fame. “Back shoulders, turn out your toes, hold up your head, “Stand easy!”.. so I did... till almost dead. O how I long'd to tend the plough again, Trudge up the field, and whistle o'er the plain, When tired and sore, amid the piteous throng, Hungry, and cold, and wet, I limp'd along, And growing fainter as I pass'd and colder, Cursed that ill hour when I became a soldier! In town I found the hours more gaily pass, And time fled swiftly with my girl and glass; The girls were wonderous kind and wonderous fair, They soon transferr'd me to the Doctor's care; The Doctor undertook to cure the evil, And he almost transferr'd me to the Devil. 'Twere tedious to relate the dismal story Of fighting, fasting, wretchedness, and glory. At last discharged, to England's shores I came, Paid for my wounds with want instead of fame; Found my fair friends, and plunder'd as they bade me; They kiss'd me, coax'd me, robb'd me, and betray'd me. Tried and condemn'd His Majesty transports me, And here in peace, I thank him, he supports me. So ends my dismal and heroic story, And Humphrey gets more good from guilt than glory. Oxford, 1794. III. JOHN, SAMUEL, AND RICHARD. Time, Evening. JOHN. 'Tis a calm pleasant evening, the light fades away, And the sun going down has done watch for the day. To my mind we live wonderous well when transported; It is but to work, and we must be supported. Fill the cann, Dick! Success here to Botany Bay! RICHARD. Success if you will, . . but God send me away! JOHN. You lubberly landsmen don't know when you're well! Hadst thou known half the hardships of which I can tell! The sailor has no place of safety in store; From the tempest at sea, to the press-gang on shore! When Roguery rules all the rest of the earth, God be thank'd, in this corner I've got a good berth. SAMUEL. Talk of hardships! what these are the sailor dont know; 'Tis the soldier, my friend, that's acquainted with woe; Long journies, short halting, hard work, and small pay, To be popt at like pigeons for sixpence a day! . . Thank God I'm safe quarter'd at Botany Bay. JOHN. Ah! you know but little: I'll wager a pot I have suffer'd more evils than fell to your lot. Come, we'll have it all fairly and properly tried, Tell story for story, and Dick shall decide. SAMUEL. Done. JOHN. Done. 'Tis a wager, and I shall be winner; Thou wilt go without grog, Sam, to-morrow at dinner. SAMUEL. I was trapp'd by the Sergeant's palavering pretences, He listed me when I was out of my senses; So I took leave to-day of all care and all sorrow, And was drill'd to repentance and reason to-morrow. JOHN. I would be a sailor and plough the wide ocean, But was soon sick and sad with the billows' commotion, So the boatswain he sent me aloft on the mast, And cursed me, and bade me cry there, . . and hold fast! SAMUEL. After marching all day, faint and hungry and sore, I have lain down at night on the swamps of the moor, Unshelter'd and forced by fatigue to remain, All chill'd by the wind and benumb'd by the rain. JOHN. I have rode out the storm when the billows beat high, And the red gleaming lightnings flash'd through the dark sky; When the tempest of night the black sea overcast, Wet and weary I labour'd, yet sung to the blast. SAMUEL. I have march'd, trumpets sounding, drums beating, flags flying, Where the music of war drown'd the shrieks of the dying; When the shots whizz'd around me, all dangers defied; Push'd on when my comrades fell dead at my side; Drove the foe from the mouth of the cannon away, Fought, conquer'd, and bled, all for sixpence a-day. JOHN. And I too, friend Samuel, have heard the shots rattle! But we seamen rejoice in the play of the battle; Though the chain and the grape-shot roll splintering around, With the blood of our messmates though slippery the ground, The fiercer the fight, still the fiercer we grow, We heed not our loss so we conquer the foe; And the hard battle won, if the prize be not sunk, The Captain gets rich, and the Sailors get drunk. SAMUEL. God help the poor soldier when backward he goes, In disgraceful retreat through a country of foes! No respite from danger by day or by night, He is still forced to fly, still o'ertaken to fight; Every step that he takes he must battle his way, He must force his hard meal from the peasant away; No rest, and no hope, from all succour afar, . . God forgive the poor soldier for going to the war! JOHN. But what are these dangers to those I have past, When the dark billows roar'd to the roar of the blast; When we work'd at the pumps worn with labour and weak, And with dread still beheld the increase of the leak? Sometimes as we rose on the wave could our sight, From the rocks of the shore catch the light-house's light; In vain to the beach to assist us they press; We fire faster and faster our guns of distress; Still with rage unabating the wind and waves roar; . . How the giddy wreck reels, as the billows burst o'er! Leap, leap; for she yawns, for she sinks in the wave! Call on God to preserve.. for God only can save! SAMUEL. There's an end of all troubles, however, at last! And when I in the waggon of wounded was cast, When my wounds with the chilly night-wind smarted sore, And I thought of the friends I should never see more, No hand to relieve, scarce a morsel of bread, Sick at heart I have envied the peace of the dead. Left to rot in a jail, till by treaty set free, Old England's white cliffs with what joy did I see! I had gain'd enough glory, some wounds, but no good, And was turn'd on the public to shift how I could. When I think what I've suffer'd, and where I am now, I curse him who snared me away from the plough. JOHN. When I was discharged, I went home to my wife, There in comfort to spend all the rest of my life. My wife was industrious, we earn'd what we spent, And though little we had, were with little content; And whenever I listen'd and heard the wind roar, I bless'd God for my little snug cabin on shore. At midnight they seized me, they dragg'd me away, They wounded me sore when I would not obey, And because for my country I'd ventured my life, I was dragg'd like a thief from my home and my wife. Then the fair wind of fortune chopt round in my face, And want at length drove me to guilt and disgrace. But all's for the best; . . on the world's wide sea cast, I am haven'd in peace in this corner at last. SAMUEL. Come, Dick! we have done.. and for judgement we call. RICHARD. And in faith I can give you no judgement at all: But that as you're now settled, and safe from foul weather, You drink up your grog, and be merry together. Oxford, 1794. IV. FREDERIC. Time, Night. Scene, The Woods. Where shall I turn me? whither shall I bend My weary way? thus worn with toil and faint, How through the thorny mazes of this wood Attain my distant dwelling? That deep cry That echoes through the forest, seems to sound My parting knell: it is the midnight howl Of hungry monsters prowling for their prey! Again! O save me—save me, gracious Heaven! I am not fit to die! Thou coward wretch, Why palpitates thy heart? why shake thy limbs Beneath their palsied burthen? Is there aught So lovely in existence? wouldst thou drain Even to its dregs the bitter draught of life? Stamp'd with the brand of Vice and Infamy, Why should the felon Frederic shrink from Death? Death! Where the magic in that empty name That chills my inmost heart? Why at the thought Starts the cold dew of fear on every limb? There are no terrors to surround the Grave, When the calm Mind collected in itself Surveys that narrow house: the ghastly train That haunt the midnight of delirious Guilt Then vanish; in that home of endless rest All sorrows cease! . . Would I might slumber there! Why then this panting of the fearful heart? This miser love of life, that dreads to lose Its cherish'd torment? Shall a man diseased Yield up his members to the surgeon's knife, Doubtful of succour, but to rid his frame Of fleshly anguish; and the coward wretch, Whose ulcerated soul can know no help, Shrink from the best Physician's certain aid? Oh, it were better far to lie me down Here on this cold damp earth, till some wild beast Seize on his willing victim. If to die Were all, 'twere sweet indeed to rest my head On the cold clod, and sleep the sleep of Death. But if the Archangel's trump at the last hour Startle the ear of Death, and wake the soul To frenzy? . . Dreams of infancy; fit tales For garrulous beldames to affrighten babes! What if I warr'd upon the world? the world Had wrong'd me first: I had endured the ills Of hard injustice; all this goodly earth Was but to me one wide waste wilderness; I had no share in Nature's patrimony; Blasted were all my morning hopes of youth, Dark Disappointment followed on my ways, Care was my bosom inmate, Penury Gnaw'd at my heart. Eternal One, thou know'st How that poor heart, even in the bitter hour Of lewdest revelry has inly yearn'd For peace. My Father! I will call on thee, Pour to thy mercy-seat my earnest prayer, And wait thy righteous will, resign'd of soul. O thought of comfort! how the afflicted heart, Tired with the tempest of its passions, rests On you with holy hope! The hollow howl Of yonder harmless tenant of the woods Comes with no terror to the sober'd sense. If I have sinn'd against mankind, on them Be that past sin; they made me what I was. In these extremest climes Want can no more Urge me to deeds of darkness, and at length Here I may rest. What though my hut be poor— The rains descend not through its humble roof: . . . Would I were there again! The night is cold; And what if in my wanderings I should rouse The savage from his thicket! Hark! the gun! And lo, the fire of safety! I shall reach My little hut again! again by toil Force from the stubborn earth my sustenance, And quick-ear'd guilt will never start alarm'd Amid the well-earn'd meal. This felon's garb.. Will it not shield me from the winds of Heaven? And what could purple more? O strengthen me, Eternal One, in this serener state! Cleanse thou mine heart, so Penitence and Faith Shall heal my soul, and my last days be peace. Oxford, 1794. SONNETS. I. [Go, Valentine, and tell that lovely maid] Go, Valentine, and tell that lovely maid Whom fancy still will pourtray to my sight, How here I linger in this sullen shade, This dreary gloom of dull monastic night; Say, that from every joy of life remote At evening's closing hour I quit the throng, Listening in solitude the ring-dove's note, Who pours like me her solitary song; Say, that her absence calls the sorrowing sigh; Say, that of all her charms I love to speak, In fancy feel the magic of her eye, In fancy view the smile illume her cheek, Court the lone hour when silence stills the grove, And heave the sigh of memory and of love. 1794. II. [Think, Valentine, as speeding on thy way] Think, Valentine, as speeding on thy way Homeward thou hastest light of heart along, If heavily creep on one little day The medley crew of travellers among, Think on thine absent friend; reflect that here On life's sad journey comfortless he roves, Remote from every scene his heart holds dear, From him he values, and from her he loves. And when, disgusted with the vain and dull Whom chance companions of thy way may doom, Thy mind, of each domestic comfort full, Turns to itself and meditates on home, Ah think what cares must ache within his breast Who loathes the road, yet sees no home of rest. 1794. III. [Not to thee, Bedford, mournful is the tale] Not to thee, Bedford, mournful is the tale Of days departed. Time in his career Arraigns not thee that the neglected year Hath past unheeded onward. To the vale Of years thou journeyest; may the future road Be pleasant as the past; and on my friend Friendship and Love, best blessings, still attend, Till full of days he reach the calm abode Where Nature slumbers. Lovely is the age Of virtue: with such reverence we behold The silver hairs, as some gray oak grown old That whilome mock'd the rushing tempest's rage, Now like a monument of strength decay'd, With rarely-sprinkled leaves casting a trembling shade 1794. IV. Corston. As thus I stand beside the murmuring stream And watch its current, memory here pourtrays Scenes faintly form'd of half-forgotten days, Like far-off woodlands by the moon's bright beam Dimly descried, but lovely. I have worn Amid these haunts the heavy hours away, When childhood idled through the Sabbath-day; Risen to my tasks at winter's earliest morn; And when the summer twilight darken'd here, Thinking of home, and all of heart forlorn, Have sigh'd and shed in secret many a tear. Dream-like and indistinct those days appear, As the faint sounds of this low brooklet, borne Upon the breeze, reach fitfully the ear. 1794. V. The Evening Rainbow. Mild arch of promise, on the evening sky Thou shinest fair with many a lovely ray Each in the other melting. Much mine eye Delights to linger on thee; for the day, Changeful and many-weather'd, seemed to smile Flashing brief splendour through the clouds awhile, Which deepen'd dark anon and fell in rain: But pleasant is it now to pause, and view Thy various tints of frail and watery hue, And think the storm shall not return again. Such is the smile that Piety bestows On the good man's pale cheek, when he, in peace Departing gently from a world of woes, Anticipates the world where sorrows cease. 1794. VI. [With many a weary step, at length I gain] With many a weary step, at length I gain Thy summit, Lansdown; and the cool breeze plays Gratefully round my brow, as hence I gaze Back on the fair expanse of yonder plain. 'Twas a long way and tedious; to the eye Though fair the extended vale, and fair to view The autumnal leaves of many a faded hue, That eddy in the wild gust moaning by. Even so it fared with life: in discontent Restless through Fortune's mingled scenes I went... Yet wept to think they would return no more. But cease, fond heart, in such sad thoughts to roam; For surely thou ere long shalt reach thy home, And pleasant is the way that lies before. 1794. VII. [Fair is the rising morn when o'er the sky] Fair is the rising morn when o'er the sky The orient sun expands his roseate ray, And lovely to the musing poet's eye Fades the soft radiance of departing day; But fairer is the smile of one we love, Than all the scenes in Nature's ample sway, And sweeter than the music of the grove, The voice that bids us welcome. Such delight, Edith! is mine, escaping to thy sight From the cold converse of the indifferent throng: Too swiftly then toward the silent night, Ye hours of happiness, ye speed along, Whilst I, from all the world's dull cares apart, Pour out the feelings of my burthen'd heart. 1794. VIII. [How darkly o'er yon far-off mountain frowns] How darkly o'er yon far-off mountain frowns The gather'd tempest! from that lurid cloud The deep-voiced thunders roll, aweful and loud Though distant; while upon the misty downs Fast falls in shadowy streaks the pelting rain. I never saw so terrible a storm! Perhaps some way-worn traveller in vain Wraps his thin raiment round his shivering form, Cold even as hope within him. I the while Pause here in sadness, though the sun-beams smile Cheerily round me. Ah! that thus my lot Might be with Peace and Solitude assign'd, Where I might from some little quiet cot Sigh for the crimes and miseries of mankind. 1794. IX. [O thou sweet Lark, who in the heaven so high] O thou sweet Lark, who in the heaven so high Twinkling thy wings dost sing so joyfully, I watch thee soaring with a deep delight, And when at last I turn mine aching eye That lags below thee in the Infinite, Still in my heart receive thy melody. O thou sweet Lark, that I had wings like thee! Not for the joy it were in yon blue light Upward to mount, and from my heavenly height Gaze on the creeping multitude below; But that I soon would wing my eager flight To that loved home where Fancy even now Hath fled, and Hope looks onward thro' a tear, Counting the weary hours that hold her here. 1798. X. [Thou lingerest, Spring! still wintry is the scene] Thou lingerest, Spring! still wintry is the scene, The fields their dead and sapless russet wear; Scarce doth the glossy celandine appear Starring the sunny bank, or early green The elder yet its circling tufts put forth. The sparrow tenants still the eaves-built nest Where we should see our martin's snowy breast Oft darting out. The blasts from the bleak north And from the keener east still frequent blow. Sweet Spring, thou lingerest; and it should be so, . Late let the fields and gardens blossom out! Like man when most with smiles thy face is drest, 'Tis to deceive, and he who knows ye best, When most ye promise, ever most must doubt. Westbury, 1799. XI. [Beware a speedy friend, the Arabian said] Beware a speedy friend, the Arabian said, And wisely was it he advised distrust: The flower that blossoms earliest fades the first. Look at yon Oak that lifts its stately head, And dallies with the autumnal storm, whose rage Tempests the great sea-waves; slowly it rose, Slowly its strength increased through many an age, And timidly did its light leaves disclose, As doubtful of the spring, their palest green. They to the summer cautiously expand, And by the warmer sun and season bland Matured, their foliage in the grove is seen, When the bare forest by the wintry blast Is swept, still lingering on the boughs the last. 1798. XII. To a Goose. If thou didst feed on western plains of yore; Or waddle wide with flat and flabby feet Over some Cambrian mountain's plashy moor; Or find in farmer's yard a safe retreat From gipsy thieves, and foxes sly and fleet; If thy grey quills, by lawyer guided, trace Deeds big with ruin to some wretched race, Or love-sick poet's sonnet, sad and sweet, Wailing the rigour of his lady fair; Or if, the drudge of housemaid's daily toil, Cobwebs and dust thy pinions white besoil, Departed Goose! I neither know nor care. But this I know, that we pronounced thee fine, Season'd with sage and onions, and port wine. London, 1798. XIII. [I marvel not, O Sun! that unto thee] I marvel not, O Sun! that unto thee In adoration man should bow the knee, And pour his prayers of mingled awe and love; For like a God thou art, and on thy way Of glory sheddest with benignant ray, Beauty, and life, and joyance from above. No longer let these mists thy radiance shroud, These cold raw mists that chill the comfortless day, But shed thy splendour through the opening cloud And cheer the earth once more. The languid flowers Lie scentless, beaten down with heavy rain; Earth asks thy presence, saturate with showers; O Lord of Light! put forth thy beams again, For damp and cheerless are the gloomy hours Westbury, 1798. XIV. [Fair be thy fortunes in the distant land] Fair be thy fortunes in the distant land, Companion of my earlier years and friend! Go to the Eastern world, and may the hand Of Heaven its blessing on thy labour send. And may I, if we ever more should meet, See thee with affluence to thy native shore Return'd; . . I need not pray that I may greet The same untainted goodness as before. Long years must intervene before that day; And what the changes Heaven to each may send, It boots not now to bode: O early friend! Assured, no distance e'er can wear away Esteem long rooted, and no change remove The dear remembrance of the friend we love. 1798. XV. [A wrinkled, crabbed man they picture thee] A wrinkled, crabbed man they picture thee, Old Winter, with a rugged beard as grey As the long moss upon the apple-tree; Blue-lipt, an ice-drop at thy sharp blue nose, Close muffled up, and on thy dreary way, Plodding alone through sleet and drifting snows. They should have drawn thee by the high-heapt hearth, Old Winter! seated in thy great arm'd chair, Watching the children at their Christmas mirth; Or circled by them as thy lips declare Some merry jest or tale of murder dire, Or troubled spirit that disturbs the night, Pausing at times to rouse the mouldering fire, Or taste the old October brown and bright. Westbury, 1799. XVI. [Porlock, thy verdant vale so fair to sight] Porlock, thy verdant vale so fair to sight, Thy lofty hills which fern and furze embrown, The waters that roll musically down Thy woody glens, the traveller with delight Recalls to memory, and the channel grey Circling its surges in thy level bay. Porlock, I also shall forget thee not, Here by the unwelcome summer rain confined; But often shall hereafter call to mind How here, a patient prisoner, 'twas my lot To wear the lonely, lingering close of day, Making my Sonnet by the alehouse fire, Whilst Idleness and Solitude inspire Dull rhymes to pass the duller hours away. August 9, 1799. XVII. [Stately yon vessel sails adown the tide] Stately yon vessel sails adown the tide, To some far distant land adventurous bound; The sailors' busy cries from side to side Pealing among the echoing rocks resound: A patient, thoughtless, much-enduring band, Joyful they enter on their ocean way, With shouts exulting leave their native land, And know no care beyond the present day. But is there no poor mourner left behind, Who sorrows for a child or husband there? Who at the howling of the midnight wind Will wake and tremble in her boding prayer? So may her voice be heard, and Heaven be kind! Go, gallant Ship, and be thy fortune fair! Westbury, 1799. XVIII. [O God! have mercy in this dreadful hour] O God! have mercy in this dreadful hour On the poor mariner! in comfort here Safe shelter'd as I am, I almost fear The blast that rages with resistless power. What were it now to toss upon the waves, The madden'd waves, and know no succour near; The howling of the storm alone to hear, And the wild sea that to the tempest raves; To gaze amid the horrors of the night And only see the billow's gleaming light; Then in the dread of death to think of her Who, as she listens sleepless to the gale, Puts up a silent prayer and waxes pale? . . . O God! have mercy on the mariner! Westbury, 1799. XIX. [She comes majestic with her swelling sails] She comes majestic with her swelling sails, The gallant Ship; along her watery way Homeward she drives before the favouring gales; Now flirting at their length the streamers play, And now they ripple with the ruffling breeze. Hark to the sailors' shouts! the rocks rebound, Thundering in echoes to the joyful sound. Long have they voyaged o'er the distant seas, And what a heart-delight they feel at last, So many toils, so many dangers past, To view the port desired, he only knows Who on the stormy deep for many a day Hath tost, aweary of his watery way, And watch'd, all anxious, every wind that blows. Westbury, 1799. XX. [Farewell my home, my home no longer now] Farewell my home, my home no longer now, Witness of many a calm and happy day; And thou fair eminence, upon whose brow Dwells the last sunshine of the evening ray, Farewell! These eyes no longer shall pursue The western sun beyond the farthest height, When slowly he forsakes the fields of light. No more the freshness of the falling dew, Cool and delightful, here shall bathe my head, As from this western window dear, I lean, Listening, the while I watch the placid scene, The martins twittering underneath the shed. Farewell, dear home! where many a day has past In joys whose loved remembrance long shall last. Westbury, 1799. MONODRAMAS. SAPPHO. Scene, The Promontory of Leucadia. This is the spot: . . 'tis here tradition says That hopeless Love from this high towering rock Leaps headlong to oblivion or to Death. Oh, 'tis a giddy height! my dizzy head Swims at the precipice! . . 'tis death to fall! Lie still, thou coward heart! this is no time To shake with thy strong throbs the frame convulsed. To die, — to be at rest, — oh, pleasant thought! Perchance to leap and live; the soul all still, And the wild tempest of the passions husht In one deep calm; the heart, no more diseased By the quick ague fits of hope and fear, Quietly cold! Presiding Powers, look down! In vain to you I pour'd my earnest prayers, In vain I sung your praises: chiefly thou, Venus! ungrateful Goddess, whom my lyre Hymn'd with such full devotion. Lesbian groves, Witness how often, at the languid hour Of summer twilight, to the melting song Ye gave your choral echoes! Grecian maids, Who hear with downcast look and flushing cheek, That lay of love, bear witness! and ye youths, Who hang enraptured on the impassion'd strain, Gazing with eloquent eye, even till the heart Sinks in the deep delirium! And ye, too, Ages unborn! bear witness ye, how hard Her fate who hymn'd the votive hymn in vain! Ungrateful Goddess! I have hung my lute In yonder holy pile; my hand no more Shall wake the melodies that fail'd to move Obdurate Phaon! . . yet when rumour tells How from Leucadia Sappho cast herself, A self-devoted victim, . . he may melt Too late in pity, obstinate to love. Oh! haunt his midnight dreams, black Nemesis! Whom ?? ???? ?????????? ??? ???? ??? ????????. Hesiod., self-conceiving in the inmost depths Of Chaos, blackest Night long labouring bore, When the stern Destinies, her elder brood, And shapeless Death, from that more monstrous birth Leapt shuddering: Haunt his slumbers, Nemesis! Scorch with the fires of Phlegethon his heart, Till helpless, hopeless, heaven-abandon'd wretch, He too shall seek beneath the unfathom'd deep To hide him from thy fury. How the sea Far distant glitters as the sun-beams smile, And gaily wanton o'er its heaving breast! Phœbus shines forth, nor wears one cloud to mourn His votary's sorrows. God of Day shine on! . . By man despised, forsaken by the Gods, I supplicate no more. How many a day, O pleasant Lesbos! in thy secret streams Delighted have I plunged, from the hot sun Screen'd by the o'er-arching grove's delightful shade, And pillow'd on the waters! Now the waves Shall chill me to repose. Tremendous height! Scarce to the brink will these rebellious limbs Support me. Hark! how the rude deep below Roars round the rugged base, as if it call'd Its long reluctant victim! I will come! . . One leap, and all is over! The deep rest Of death, or tranquil apathy's dead calm, Welcome alike to me. Away, vain fears! Phaon is cold, and why should Sappho live? Phaon is cold, or with some fairer one... Thought worse than death! She throws herself from the precipice. Oxford, 1793. XIMALPOCA. The story of this Mexican King is related by Torquemada in his Monarquia Indiana, l. ii. c. 28. and by the Abate Clavigero, Storia Antica del Messico, t. i. l. iii. p. 199. The sacrifice was not completed; a force sent by his enemy arrived in time to prevent the catastrophe; he was carried off captive, and destroyed himself in prison. Scene, The Temple of Mexitli. Subjects! friends! children! I may call you children, For I have ever borne a father's love Towards you; it is thirteen years since first You saw me in the robes of royalty, . . Since here the multitudes of Mexico Hail'd me their King. I thank you, friends, that now, In equal numbers and with equal love, You come to grace my death. For thirteen years What I have been, ye know: that with all care, That with all justness and all gentleness, Seeking your weal, I govern'd, Is there one Whom I have injured? one whose just redress I have denied, or baffled by delay? Let him come forth, that so no evil tongue Speak shame of me hereafter. O my people, Not by my sins have I drawn down upon me The wrath of Heaven. The wrath is heavy on me! Heavy! a burthen more than I can bear! I have endured contempt, insult, and wrongs From that Acolhuan tyrant. Should I seek Revenge? alas, my people, we are few, . . Feeble our growing state; it hath not yet Rooted itself to bear the hurricane; It is the lion-cub that tempts not yet The tyger's full-aged fury. Mexicans, He sent to bid me wear a woman's robe; . . When was the day that ever I look'd back In battle? Mexicans, the wife I loved, To faith and friendship trusted, in despite Of me, of heaven, he seized, and spurn'd her back Polluted! . . . Coward villain! and he lurks Behind his armies and his multitudes, And mocks my idle wrath! . . It is not fit.. It is not possible that I should live! . . Live! and deserve to be the finger-mark Of slave-contempt! . . . His blood I cannot reach, But in my own all stains may be effaced; It shall blot out the marks of infamy, And when the warriors of the days to come Tell of Ximalpoca, it shall be said He died the brave man's death! Not of the God Unworthy, do I seek his altar thus, A voluntary victim. And perchance The sacrifice of life may profit ye, My people, though all living efforts fail'd By fortune, not by fault. Cease your lament! And if your ill-doom'd King deserved your love, Say of him to your children, he was one Who bravely bore misfortune; who, when life Became dishonour, shook his body off, And join'd the spirits of the heroes dead. Yes! not in Miclanteuctli's dark abode With cowards shall your King receive his doom: Not in the icy caverns of the North Suffer through endless ages. He shall join The Spirits of the brave, with them at morn Shall issue from the eastern gate of Heaven, And follow through his fields of light the Sun; With them shall raise the song and weave the dance; Sport in the stream of splendour; company Down to the western palace of his rest The Prince of Glory; and with equal eye Endure his center'd radiance. Not of you Forgetful, O my people, even then; But often in the amber cloud of noon Diffused, will I o'erspread your summer fields, And on the freshen'd maize and brightening meads Shower plenty. Spirits of my valiant Sires, I come! Mexitli, never at thy shrine Flow'd braver blood; never a nobler heart Steam'd up to thee its life! Priests of the God, Perform your office! Wesibury, 1798. THE WIFE OF FERGUS. Scene, The Palace Court. The Queen speaking from the Battlements Cease.. cease your torments! spare the sufferers! Scotchmen, not theirs the deed; . . the crime was mine. Mine is the glory. Idle threats! I stand Secure. All access to these battlements Is barr'd beyond your sudden strength to force; And lo! the dagger by which Fergus died! Shame on ye, Scotchmen, that a woman's hand Was left to do this deed! Shame on ye, Thanes, Who with slave-patience have so long endured The wrongs, and insolence of tyranny! Cowardly race! . . that not a husband's sword Smote that adulterous King! that not a wife Revenged her own pollution; in his blood Wash'd herself pure, and for the sin compell'd Atoned by righteous murder! . . O my God! Of what beast-matter has thou moulded them To bear with wrongs like these? There was a time When if the Bard had feign'd you such a tale, Your eyes had throbb'd with anger, and your hand, In honest instinct would have graspt the sword. O miserable men, who have disgraced Your fathers, whom your sons must blush to name! Ay, . . ye can threaten me! ye can be brave In anger to a woman! one whose virtue Upbraids your coward vice; whose name will live Honour'd and praised in song, when not a hand Shall root from your forgotten monuments The cankering moss. Fools! fools! to think that death Is not a thing familiar to my mind; As if I knew not what must consummate My glory! as if aught that earth can give Could tempt me to endure the load of life! . . . Scotchmen! ye saw when Fergus to the altar Led me, his maiden Queen. Ye blest me then, . . I heard you bless me, . . and I thought that Heaven Had heard you also, and that I was blest; For I loved Fergus. Bear me witness, God! With what a heart and soul sincerity My lips pronounced the unrecallable vow That made me his, him mine; bear witness, Thou! Before whose throne I this day must appear Stain'd with his blood and mine! My heart was his, . . His in the strength of all its first affections. In all obedience, in all love, I kept Holy my marriage-vow. Behold me, Thanes! Time hath not changed the face on which his eye So often dwelt, when with assiduous care He sought my love, with seeming truth, for one, Sincere herself, impossible to doubt. Time hath not changed that face! . . I speak not now With pride of beauties that will feed the worm To-morrow; but with honest pride I say, That if the truest and the purest love Deserved requital, such was ever mine. How often reeking from the adulterous bed Have I received him! and with no complaint. Neglect and insult, cruelty and scorn, Long, long did I endure, and long curb down The indignant nature. Tell your countrymen, Scotchmen, what I have spoken! Say to them Ye saw the Queen of Scotland lift the dagger Red from her husband's heart; that in her own She plunged it. Stabs herself. Tell them also, that she felt No guilty fear in death. Westbury, 1798. LUCRETIA. Scene, The House of Collatine. Welcome, my father! good Valerius, Welcome! and thou too, Brutus! ye were both My wedding guests, and fitly ye are come. My husband.. Collatine.. alas! no more Lucretia's husband, for thou shalt not clasp Pollution to thy bosom, . . . hear me on! For I must tell thee all. I sat at eve Spinning amid my maidens as I wont, When from the camp at Ardea Sextus came. Curb down thy swelling feelings, Collatine! I little liked the man! yet, for he came From Ardea, for he brought me news of thee, I gladly gave him welcome; gladly listen'd, . . Thou canst not tell how gladly, . . to his tales Of battles, and the long and perilous siege; And when I laid me down at night to sleep, 'Twas with a lighten'd heart, . . I knew thee safe, My visions were of thee. Nay, hear me out! And be thou wise in vengeance, so thy wife Not vainly shall have suffer'd. I have wrought My soul up to the business of this hour, That it may stir your noble spirits, and prompt Such glorious deeds that ages yet unborn Shall bless my fate. At midnight I awoke, The Tarquin was beside me! O my husband, Where wert thou then! gone was my rebel strength, . . All power of utterance gone! astonish'd, stunn'd, I saw the coward ruffian, heard him urge His wicked suit, and bid me tamely yield, . . Yield to dishonour. When he proffer'd death, . . Oh, I had leapt to meet the merciful sword! But that with most accursed vows he vow'd, That he would lay a dead slave by my side, Murdering my spotless honour... Collatine, From what an anguish have I rescued thee! And thou, my father, wretched as thou art, Thou miserable, childless, poor old man, . . . Think, father, what that agony had been! Now thou may'st sorrow for me, thou may'st bless The memory of thy poor, polluted child. Look if it have not kindled Brutus' eye: Mysterious man! at last I know thee now, I see thy dawning glories! . . to the grave Not unrevenged Lucretia shall descend; Not always shall her wretched country wear The Tarquin's yoke! Ye will deliver Rome, And I have comfort in this dreadful hour. Thinkest thou, my husband, that I dreaded death? O Collatine! the weapon that had gored My bosom had been ease, been happiness, . . Elysium, to the hell of his hot grasp. Judge if Lucretia could have fear'd to die! Stabs herself. Bristol, 1799. LA CABA. Father! Count Illan! here — what here I say,— Aloft.. look up! . . . aye, father, here I stand, Safe of my purpose now! The way is barr'd;— Thou need'st not hasten hither!—Ho! Count Illan, I tell thee I have barr'd the battlements! I tell thee that no human power can curb A desperate will. The poison and the knife.. These thou couldst wrest from me; but here I stand Beyond thy thrall; free mistress of myself. Though thou hadst wings thou could'st not overtake My purpose. I command my destiny. Would I stand dallying on Death's threshold here, If it were possible that hand of man Could pluck me back? Why didst thou bring me here To set my foot, reluctant as I was, On this most injured and unhappy land? Yonder in Afric.. on a foreign shore, I might have linger'd out my wretched life... I might have found some distant lurking place, Where my accursed tale was never known; Where Gothic speech would never reach my ear,— Where among savages I might have fled The leprous curse of infamy! But here— In Spain, — in my own country; — night and morn Where all good people curse me in their prayers; Where every Moorish accent that I hear Doth tell me of my country's overthrow, Doth stab me like a dagger to the soul; Here — here — in desolated Spain, whose fields Yet reek to Heaven with blood, — whose slaughter'd sons Lie rotting in the open light of day, My victims; — said I mine? Nay—nay Count Illan, They are thy victims! at the throne of God Their spirits call for vengeance on thy head; Their blood is on thy soul, — even I, myself I am thy victim too, — and this death more Must yet be placed in Hell to thy account. O my dear Country! O my mother Spain! My cradle and my grave! — for thou art dear, And nurst to thy undoing as I was, Still, still I am thy child — and love thee still; I shall be written in thy chronicles The veryest wretch that ever yet betray'd Her native land! From sire to son my name Will be transmitted down for infamy!— Never again will mother call her child La Caba, — an Iscariot curse will lie Upon the name, and children in their songs Will teach the rocks and hills to echo with it Strumpet and traitoress! This is thy work, father! Nay tell me not my shame is wash'd away— That all this ruin and this misery Is vengeance for my wrongs. I ask'd not this,— I call'd for open, manly, Gothic vengeance. Thou wert a vassal, and thy villain lord Most falsely and most foully broke his faith; Thou wert a father, and the lustful king By force abused thy child; — Thou hadst a sword, Shame on thee to call in the scymetar To do thy work! Thou wert a Goth—a Christian— Son of an old and honourable house,— It was my boast, my proudest happiness, To think I was the daughter of Count Illan. Fool that I am to call this African By that good name! Oh do not spread thy hands To me! — and put not on that father's look! Moor! turbaned misbeliever! renegade! Circumcised traitor! Thou Count Illan, Thou!— Thou my dear father? — cover me, O Earth! Hell hide me from the knowledge! Bristol, 1802. THE AMATORY POEMS OF ABEL SHUFFLEBOTTOM. SONNET I. DELIA AT PLAY. She held a Cup and Ball of ivory white, Less white the ivory than her snowy hand! Enrapt, I watch'd her from my secret stand, As now, intent, in innocent delight, Her taper fingers twirl'd the giddy ball, Now tost it, following still with eagle sight, Now on the pointed end infix'd its fall. Marking her sport I mused, and musing sigh'd, Methought the ball she play'd with was my heart; (Alas! that sport like that should be her pride!) And the keen point which stedfast still she eyed Wherewith to pierce it, that was Cupid's dart; Shall I not then the cruel Fair condemn Who on that dart impales my bosom's gem? SONNET II. TO A PAINTER ATTEMPTING DELIA'S PORTRAIT. Rash Painter! canst thou give the orb of day In all its noontide glory? or portray The diamond, that athwart the taper'd hall Flings the rich flashes of its dazzling light? Even if thine art could boast such magic might, Yet if it strove to paint my Angel's eye, Here it perforce must fail. Cease! lest I call Heaven's vengeance on thy sin: Must thou be told The crime it is to paint divinity? Rash Painter! should the world her charms behold, Dim and defiled, as there they needs must be, They to their old idolatry would fall, And bend before her form the pagan knee, Fairer than Venus, daughter of the sea. SONNET III. HE PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A SOUL FROM HIS LOVE FOR DELIA. Some have denied a soul! they never loved. Far from my Delia now by fate removed, At home, abroad, I view her every where; Her only in the flood of noon I see, My Goddess-Maid, my omnipresent fair, For love annihilates the world to me! And when the weary Sol around his bed Closes the sable curtains of the night, Sun of my slumbers, on my dazzled sight She shines confest. When every sound is dead, The spirit of her voice comes then to roll The surge of music o'er my wavy brain. Far, far from her my Body drags its chain, But sure with Delia I exist a soul! SONNET IV. THE POET EXPRESSES HIS FEELINGS RESPECTING A PORTRAIT IN DELIA'S PARLOUR. I would I were that portly Gentleman With gold-laced hat and golden-headed cane, Who hangs in Delia's parlour! For whene'er From book or needlework her looks arise, On him converge the sun-beams of her eyes, And he unblamed may gaze upon my fair, And oft my fair his favour'd form surveys. O happy picture! still on her to gaze; I envy him! and jealous fear alarms, Lest the strong glance of those divinest charms Warm him to life, as in the ancient days, When marble melted in Pygmalion's arms. I would I were that portly Gentleman With gold-laced hat and golden-headed cane. LOVE ELEGIES. ELEGY I. THE POET RELATES HOW HE OBTAINED DELIA'S POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF. 'Tis mine! what accents can my joy declare? Blest be the pressure of the thronging rout! Blest be the hand so hasty of my fair, That left the tempting corner hanging out! I envy not the joy the pilgrim feels, After long travel to some distant shrine, When at the relic of his saint he kneels, For Delia's pocket-handkerchief is mine. When first with filching fingers I drew near, Keen hope shot tremulous through every vein; And when the finish'd deed removed my fear, Scarce could my bounding heart its joy contain. What though the Eighth Commandment rose to mind, It only served a moment's qualm to move; For thefts like this it could not be design'd, The Eighth Commandment was not made for love! Here when she took the macaroons from me, She wiped her mouth to clean the crumbs so sweet! Dear napkin! yes, she wiped her lips in thee! Lips sweeter than the macaroons she eat. And when she took that pinch of Mocabaw, That made my Love so delicately sneeze, Thee to her Roman nose applied I saw, And thou art doubly dear for things like these. No washerwoman's filthy hand shall e'er, Sweet pocket-handkerchief! thy worth profane; For thou hast touch'd the rubies of my fair, And I will kiss thee o'er and o'er again. ELEGY II. THE POET INVOKES THE SPIRITS OF THE ELEMENTS TO APPROACH DELIA. — HE DESCRIBES HER SINGING. Ye Sylphs, who banquet on my Delia's blush, Who on her locks of floating gold repose, Dip in her cheek your gossamery brush, And with its bloom of beauty tinge the rose. Hover around her lips on rainbow wing, Load from her honey'd breath your viewless feet, Bear thence a richer fragrance for the Spring, And make the lily and the violet sweet. Ye Gnomes, whose toil through many a dateless year Its nurture to the infant gem supplies, From central caverns bring your diamonds here, To ripen in the sun of Delia's eyes. And ye who bathe in Etna's lava springs, Spirits of fire! to see my love advance; Fly, Salamanders, on Asbestos' wings, To wanton in my Delia's fiery glance. She weeps, she weeps! her eye with anguish swells, Some tale of sorrow melts my feeling girl! Nymphs! catch the tears, and in your lucid shells Enclose them, embryos of the orient pearl. She sings! the Nightingale with envy hears, The Cherub listens from his starry throne, And motionless are stopt the attentive Spheres, To hear more heavenly music than their own. Cease, Delia, cease! for all the angel throng, Hearkening to thee, let sleep their golden wires! Cease, Delia, cease that too surpassing song, Lest, stung to envy, they should break their lyres. Cease, ere my senses are to madness driven By the strong joy! Cease, Delia, lest my soul, Enrapt, already think itself in heaven, And burst the feeble Body's frail controul. ELEGY III. THE POET EXPATIATES ON THE BEAUTY OF DELIA'S HAIR. The comb between whose ivory teeth she strains The straitening curls of gold so beamy bright, Not spotless merely from the touch remains, But issues forth more pure, more milky white. The rose-pomatum that the Friseur spreads Sometimes with honour'd fingers for my fair No added perfume on her tresses sheds, But borrows sweetness from her sweeter hair. Happy the Friseur who in Delia's hair With licensed fingers uncontroul'd may rove! And happy in his death the dancing bear, Who died to make pomatum for my love. Oh could I hope that e'er my favour'd lays Might curl those lovely locks with conscious pride, Nor Hammond, nor the Mantuan Shepherd's praise, I'd envy then, nor wish reward beside. Cupid has strung from you, O tresses fine, The bow that in my breast impell'd his dart; From you, sweet locks! he wove the subtile line Wherewith the urchin angled for my Heart. Fine are my Delia's tresses as the threads That from the silk-worm, self-interr'd, proceed; Fine as the gleamy Gossamer that spreads Its filmy web-work o'er the tangled mead. Yet with these tresses Cupid's power elate My captive heart has handcuff'd in a chain, Strong as the cables of some huge first-rate, That bears Britannia's thunders o'er the main. The Sylphs that round her radiant locks repair, In flowing lustre bathe their brightening wings; And Elfin Minstrels with assiduous care The ringlets rob for faery fiddle-strings. ELEGY IV. THE POET RELATES HOW HE STOLE A LOCK OF DELIA'S HAIR, AND HER ANGER. Oh! be the day accurst that gave me birth! Ye Seas, to swallow me in kindness rise! Fall on me, Mountains! and thou merciful Earth, Open, and hide me from my Delia's eyes! Let universal Chaos now return, Now let the central fires their prison burst, And earth and heaven and air and ocean burn.. For Delia frowns.. she frowns, and I am curst! Oh! I could dare the fury of the fight, Where hostile millions sought my single life; Would storm volcano batteries with delight, And grapple with grim death in glorious strife. Oh! I could brave the bolts of angry Jove, When ceaseless lightnings fire the midnight skies; What is his wrath to that of her I love? What is his lightning to my Delia's eyes? Go, fatal lock! I cast thee to the wind; Ye serpent curls, ye poison-tendrils, go! Would I could tear thy memory from my mind, Accursed lock, . . thou cause of all my woe! Seize the curst curls, ye Furies, as they fly! Demons of Darkness, guard the infernal roll, That thence your cruel vengeance when I die, May knit the knots of torture for my soul. Last night, . . Oh hear me, Heaven, and grant my prayer! The book of fate before thy suppliant lay, And let me from its ample records tear Only the single page of yesterday! Or let me meet old Time upon his flight, And I will stop him on his restless way; Omnipotent in Love's resistless might, I'll force him back the road of yesterday. Last night, as o'er the page of Love's despair, My Delia bent deliciously to grieve, I stood a treacherous loiterer by her chair, And drew the fatal scissars from my sleeve; And would that at that instant o'er my thread The shears of Atropos had open'd then; And when I reft the lock from Delia's head, Had cut me sudden from the sons of men! She heard the scissars that fair lock divide, And whilst my heart with transport panted big, She cast a fury frown on me, and cried, “You stupid Puppy, . . you have spoil'd my Wig!” Westbury, 1799. LYRIC POEMS. TO HORROR. ??? ??? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ???????? ????????? ????????? ?????? ??? ?? ????, ??? ????? ????. Theocritus. Dark Horror! hear my call! Stern Genius, hear from thy retreat On some old sepulchre's moss-canker'd seat, Beneath the Abbey's ivied wall That trembles o'er its shade; Where wrapt in midnight gloom, alone, Thou lovest to lie and hear The roar of waters near, And listen to the deep dull groan Of some perturbed sprite Borne fitful on the heavy gales of night. Or whether o'er some wide waste hill Thou see'st the traveller stray, Bewilder'd on his lonely way, When, loud and keen and chill, The evening winds of winter blow, Drifting deep the dismal snow. Or if thou followest now on Greenland's shore, With all thy terrors, on the lonely way Of some wreck'd mariner, where to the roar Of herded bears, the floating ice-hills round Return their echoing sound, And by the dim drear Boreal light Givest half his dangers to the wretch's sight. Or if thy fury form, When o'er the midnight deep The dark-wing'd tempests sweep, Beholds from some high cliff the increasing storm, Watching with strange delight, As the black billows to the thunder rave, When by the lightning's light Thou see'st the tall ship sink beneath the wave. Bear me in spirit where the field of fight Scatters contagion on the tainted gale, When, to the Moon's faint beam, On many a carcase shine the dews of night, And a dead silence stills the vale, Save when at times is heard the glutted Raven's scream. Where some wreck'd army from the Conqueror's might Speed their disastrous flight, With thee, fierce Genius! let me trace their way, And hear at times the deep heart-groan Of some poor sufferer left to die alone; And we will pause, where, on the wild, The mother to her breast, On the heap'd snows reclining, clasps her child, Not to be pitied now, for both are now at rest. Black Horror! speed we to the bed of Death, Where one who wide and far Hath sent abroad the myriad plagues of war Struggles with his last breath, Then to his wildly-starting eyes The spectres of the slaughter'd rise; Then on his phrensied ear Their calls for vengeance and the Demons' yell In one heart-maddening chorus swell; Cold on his brow convulsing stands the dew, And night eternal darkens on his view. Horror! I call thee yet once more! Bear me to that accursed shore, Where on the stake the Negro writhes. Assume thy sacred terrors then! dispense The gales of Pestilence! Arouse the opprest; teach them to know their power; Lead them to vengeance! and in that dread hour When ruin rages wide, I will behold and smile by Mercy's side. Bristol, 1791. TO CONTEMPLATION. ??? ????? ???????? ??? ??????? ???? ???????, ? ?????? ???????? ??? ???????, ???? ????????. Moschus. Faint gleams the evening radiance through the sky, The sober twilight dimly darkens round; In short quick circles the shrill bat flits by, And the slow vapour curls along the ground. Now the pleased eye from yon lone cottage sees On the green mead the smoke long-shadowing play; The Red-breast on the blossom'd spray Warbles wild her latest lay; And lo! the Rooks to yon high-tufted trees Wing in long files vociferous their way. Calm Contemplation, 'tis thy favourite hour! Come, tranquillizing Power! I view thee on the calmy shore When Ocean stills his waves to rest; Or when slow-moving on the surges hoar Meet with deep hollow roar And whiten o'er his breast; And when the Moon with softer radiance gleams, And lovelier heave the billows in her beams. When the low gales of evening moan along, I love with thee to feel the calm cool breeze, And roam the pathless forest wilds among, Listening the mellow murmur of the trees Full-foliaged, as they wave their heads on high, And to the winds respond in symphony. Or lead me where amid the tranquil vale The broken streamlet flows in silver light; And I will linger where the gale O'er the bank of violets sighs, Listening to hear its soften'd sounds arise, And hearken the dull beetle's drowsy flight, And watch the tube-eyed snail Creep o'er his long moon-glittering trail, And mark where radiant through the night Shines in the grass-green hedge the glow-worms living light. Thee, meekest Power! I love to meet, As oft with solitary pace The ruin'd Abbey's hallowed rounds I trace, And listen to the echoings of my feet. Or on some half-demolish'd tomb, Whose warning texts anticipate my doom, Mark the clear orb of night Cast through the ivy'd arch a broken light. Nor will I not in some more gloomy hour Invoke with fearless awe thine holier power, Wandering beneath the sacred pile When the blast moans along the darksome aisle, And clattering patters all around The midnight shower with dreary sound. But sweeter 'tis to wander wild By melancholy dreams beguiled, While the summer moon's pale ray Faintly guides me on my way To some lone romantic glen Far from all the haunts of men; Where no noise of uproar rude Breaks the calm of solitude; But soothing Silence sleeps in all, Save the neighbouring waterfall, Whose hoarse waters falling near Load with hollow sounds the ear, And with down-dasht torrent white Gleam hoary through the shades of night Thus wandering silent on and slow, I'll nurse Reflection's sacred woe, And muse upon the happier day When Hope would weave her visions gay, Ere Fancy, chill'd by adverse fate, Left sad Reality my mate. O Contemplation! when to Memory's eyes The visions of the long-past days arise, Thy holy power imparts the best relief, And the calm'd Spirit loves the joy of grief. Bristol, 1792. TO A FRIEND. Oh my faithful Friend! Oh early chosen, ever found the same, And trusted and beloved! once more the verse Long destined, always obvious to thine ear, Attend indulgent. Akenside. And would'st thou seek the low abode Where Peace delights to dwell? Pause, Traveller, on thy way of life! With many a snare and peril rife Is that long labyrinth of road! Dark is the vale of years before; Pause, Traveller, on thy way, Nor dare the dangerous path explore Till old Experience comes to lend his leading ray. Not he who comes with lanthorn light Shall guide thy groping pace aright With faltering feet and slow; No! let him rear the torch on high, And every maze shall meet thine eye, And every snare and every foe; Then with steady step and strong, Traveller, shalt thou march along. Though Power invite thee to her hall, Regard not thou her tempting call, Her splendour's meteor glare; Though courteous Flattery there await, And Wealth adorn the dome of State, There stalks the midnight spectre Care: Peace, Traveller, doth not sojourn there. If Fame allure thee, climb not thou To that steep mountain's craggy brow Where stands her stately pile; For far from thence doth Peace abide, And thou shalt find Fame's favouring smile Cold as the feeble Sun on Hecla's snow-clad side. And, Traveller! as thou hopest to find That low and loved abode, Retire thee from the thronging road, And shun the mob of human-kind. Ah! hear how old Experience schools, “Fly, fly the crowd of Knaves and Fools, “And thou shalt fly from woe! “The one thy heedless heart will greet “With Judas-smile, and thou wilt meet “In every Fool a Foe!” So safely may'st thou pass from these, And reach secure the home of Peace, And Friendship find thee there; No happier state can mortal know, No happier lot can Earth bestow, If Love thy lot shall share. Yet still Content with him may dwell Whom Hymen will not bless, And Virtue sojourn in the cell Of hermit Happiness. Bristol, 1793. REMEMBRANCE. The remembrance of Youth is a sigh. Ali. Man hath a weary pilgrimage As through the world he wends, On every stage from youth to age Still discontent attends; With heaviness he casts his eye Upon the road before, And still remembers with a sigh The days that are no more. To school the little exile goes, Torn from his mother's arms, . . What then shall soothe his earliest woes, When novelty hath lost its charms? Condemn'd to suffer through the day Restraints which no rewards repay, And cares where love has no concern, Hope lengthens as she counts the hours Before his wish'd return. From hard controul and tyrant rules, The unfeeling discipline of schools, In thought he loves to roam, And tears will struggle in his eye While he remembers with a sigh The comforts of his home. Youth comes; the toils and cares of life Torment the restless mind; Where shall the tired and harass'd heart Its consolation find? Then is not Youth, as Fancy tells, Life's summer prime of joy? Ah no! for hopes too long delay'd And feelings blasted or betray'd, It's fabled bliss destroy; And Youth remembers with a sigh The careless days of Infancy. Maturer Manhood now arrives, And other thoughts come on, But with the baseless hopes of Youth Its generous warmth is gone; Cold calculating cares succeed, The timid thought, the wary deed, The dull realities of truth; Back on the past he turns his eye, Remembering with an envious sigh The happy dreams of Youth. So reaches he the latter stage Of this our mortal pilgrimage, With feeble step and slow; New ills that latter stage await, And old Experience learns too late That all is vanity below. Life's vain delusions are gone by Its idle hopes are o'er, Yet age remembers with a sigh The days that are no more. Westbury, 1798. THE SOLDIER'S WIFE. DACTYLICS. Weary way-wanderer, languid and sick at heart, Travelling painfully over the rugged road, Wild-visaged Wanderer! God help thee wretched one! Sorely thy little one drags by thee bare-footed, Cold is the baby that hangs at thy bending back, Meagre and livid and screaming for misery. This Stanza was written by S. T. Coleridge.Woe-begone mother, half anger, half agony, As over thy shoulder thou lookest to hush the bahe, Bleakly the blinding snow beats in thy hagged face. Ne'er will thy husband return from the war again, Cold is thy heart and as frozen as Charity! Cold are thy children.—Now God be thy comforter! Bristol, 1795. THE WIDOW. SAPPHICS. Cold was the night wind, drifting fast the snow fell, Wide were the downs and shelterless and naked, When a poor Wanderer struggled on her journey, Weary and way-sore. Drear were the downs, more dreary her reflections; Cold was the night-wind, colder was her bosom: She had no home, the world was all before her, She had no shelter. Fast o'er the heath a chariot rattled by her, “Pity me!” feebly cried the lonely wanderer; “Pity me, strangers! lest with cold and hunger Here I should perish. “Once I had friends,—though now by all forsaken! Once I had parents,—they are now in Heaven! I had a home once—I had once a husband— Pity me, strangers! “I had a home once—I had once a husband— I am a widow, poor and broken-hearted!” Loud blew the wind, unheard was her complaining, On drove the chariot. Then on the snow she laid her down to rest her, She heard a horseman, “Pity me!” she groan'd out; Loud was the wind, unheard was her complaining, On went the horseman Worn out with anguish, toil and cold and hunger, Down sunk the Wanderer, sleep had seized her senses; There did the traveller find her in the morning; God had released her. Bristol, 1795. THE CHAPEL BELL. Lo I, the man who from the Muse did ask Her deepest notes to swell the Patriot's meeds, Am now enforced, a far unfitter task, For cap and gown to leave my minstrel weeds; For yon dull tone that tinkles on the air Bids me lay by the lyre and go to morning prayer Oh how I hate the sound! it is the knell That still a requiem tolls to Comfort's hour; And loth am I, at Superstition's bell, To quit or Morpheus' or the Muse's bower: Better to lie and doze, than gape amain, Hearing still mumbled o'er the same eternal strain. Thou tedious herald of more tedious prayers, Say, dost thou ever summon from his rest One being wakening to religious cares? Or rouse one pious transport in the breast? Or rather, do not all reluctant creep To linger out the time in listlessness or sleep? I love the bell that calls the poor to pray, Chiming from village church its cheerful sound, When the sun smiles on Labour's holy-day, And all the rustic train are gather'd round, Each deftly dizen'd in his Sunday's best, And pleased to hail the day of piety and rest. And when, dim shadowing o'er the face of day The mantling mists of even-tide rise slow, As through the forest gloom I wend my way, The minster curfew's sullen voice I know, And pause, and love its solemn toll to hear, As made by distance soft it dies upon the ear Nor with an idle nor unwilling ear Do I receive the early passing-bell; For, sick at heart with many a secret care, When I lie listening to the dead man's knell, I think that in the grave all sorrows cease, And would full fain recline my head and be at peace. But thou, memorial of monastic gall! What fancy sad or lightsome hast thou given? Thy vision-scaring sounds alone recall The prayer that trembles on a yawn to heaven, The snuffling, snaffling Fellow's nasal tone, And Romish rites retain'd, though Romish faith be flown. Oxford, 1793. TO HYMEN. God of the torch, whose soul-illuming flame Beams brightest radiance o'er the human heart, Of many a woe the cure, Of many a joy the source; To thee I sing, if haply may the Muse Pour forth the song unblamed from these dull haunts Where never beams thy torch To cheer the sullen scene. I pour the song to thee, though haply doom'd Alone and unbeloved to pass my days; Though doom'd perchance to die Alone and unbewail'd. Yet will the lark albeit in cage enthrall'd Send out her voice to greet the morning sun, As wide his cheerful beams Light up the landscape round; When high in heaven she hears the caroling, The prisoner too begins her morning hymn, And hails the beam of joy, Of joy to her denied. Friend to each better feeling of the soul, I sing to thee, for many a joy is thine, And many a Virtue comes To join thy happy train. Lured by the splendour of thy sacred torch, The beacon-light of bliss, young Love draws near, And leads his willing slaves To wear thy flowery chain. And chasten'd Friendship comes, whose mildest sway Shall cheer the hour of age, when fainter burn The fading flame of Love, The fading flame of Life. Parent of every bliss, the busy hand Of Fancy oft will paint in brightest hues How calm, how clear, thy torch Illumes the wintry hour; Will paint the wearied labourer at that hour, When friendly darkness yields a pause to toil, Returning blithely home To each domestic joy; Will paint the well-trimm'd fire, the frugal meal Prepared with fond solicitude to please; The ruddy children round Climbing the father's knee. And oft will Fancy rise above the lot Of honest Poverty, and think how man Nor rich, nor poor, enjoys His best and happiest state; When toil no longer irksome and constrain'd By hard necessity, but comes to please, To vary the still hour Of tranquil happiness. Why, Fancy, wilt thou, o'er the lovely scene Pouring thy vivid hues, why, sorceress bland, Soothe sad reality With visionary bliss? Turn thou thine eyes to where the hallowed light Of Learning shines; ah rather lead thy son Along her mystic paths To drink the sacred spring. Lead calmly on along the unvaried path To solitary Age's drear abode; . . . Is it not happiness That gives the sting to Death? Well then is he whose unembitter'd years Are waning on in lonely listlessness; If Life hath little joy, Death hath for him no sting. Oxford, 1794. WRITTEN ON THE FIRST OF DECEMBER. Though now no more the musing ear Delights to listen to the breeze, That lingers o'er the green-wood shade, I love thee, Winter! well. Sweet are the harmonies of Spring, Sweet is the Summer's evening gale, And sweet the Autumnal winds that shake The many-colour'd grove. And pleasant to the sober'd soul The silence of the wintry scene, When Nature shrouds herself, entranced In deep tranquillity. Not undelightful now to roam The wild heath sparkling on the sight; Not undelightful now to pace The forest's ample rounds; And see the spangled branches shine; And mark the moss of many a hue That varies the old tree's brown bark, Or o'er the gray stone spreads. And see the cluster'd berries bright Amid the holly's gay green leaves; The ivy round the leafless oak That clasps its foliage close. So Virtue diffident of strength Clings to Religion's firmer aid; So by Religion's aid upheld, Endures calamity. Nor void of beauties now the spring, Whose waters hid from summer-sun Have soothed the thirsty pilgrim's ear With more than melody. Green moss shines there with ice incased; The long grass bends its spear-like form: And lovely is the silvery scene When faint the sun-beams smile. Reflection too may love the hour When Nature, hid in Winter's grave, No more expands the bursting bud, Or bids the flowret bloom; For Nature soon in Spring's best charms, Shall rise revived from Winter's grave, Expand the bursting bud again, And bid the flower re-bloom. Bath, 1793. WRITTEN ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY. Come, melancholy Moralizer, come! Gather with me the dark and wintry wreath; With me engarland now The Sepulchre of Time. Come, Moralizer, to the funeral song! I pour the dirge of the Departed Days; For well the funeral song Befits this solemn hour. But hark! even now the merry bells ring round With clamorous joy to welcome in this day, This consecrated day, To Joy and Merriment. Mortal! while Fortune with benignant hand Fills to the brim thy cup of happiness, Whilst her unclouded sun Illumes thy summer day, Canst thou rejoice, . . . rejoice that Time flies fast? That night shall shadow soon thy summer-sun? That swift the stream of Years Rolls to Eternity? If thou hast wealth to gratify each wish, If power be thine, remember what thou art! Remember thou art Man, And Death thine heritage! Hast thou known Love! Doth Beauty's better sun Cheer thy fond heart with no capricious smile, Her eye all eloquence, All harmony her voice? Oh state of happiness! . . . Hark! how the gale Moans deep and hollow through the leafless grove! Winter is dark and cold; Where now the charms of Spring! Say'st thou that Fancy paints the future scene In hues too sombrous? that the dark-stoled Maid With frowning front severe Appals the shuddering soul? And would'st thou bid me court her fairy form, When, as she sports her in some happier mood, Her many-coloured robes Float varying in the sun? Ah! vainly does the Pilgrim, whose long road Leads o'er a barren mountain's storm-vext height, With wistful eye behold Some quiet vale, far off. And there are those who love the pensive song, To whom all sounds of Mirth are dissonant; Them in accordant mood This thoughtful strain will find. For hopeless Sorrow hails the lapse of Time, Rejoicing when the fading orb of day Is sunk again in night, That one day more is gone. And he who bears Affliction's heavy load With patient piety, well pleased he knows The World a pilgrimage, The Grave his inn of rest. Bath, 1794. WRITTEN ON SUNDAY MORNING. Go thou and seek the House of Prayer! I to the woodlands wend, and there In lovely Nature see the God of Love. The swelling organ's peal Wakes not my soul to zeal, Like the sweet music of the vernal grove. The gorgeous altar and the mystic vest Excite not such devotion in my breast, As where the noon-tide beam Flash'd from some broken stream, Vibrates on the dazzled sight; Or where the cloud-suspended rain Sweeps in shadows o'er the plain; Or when reclining on the cliff's huge height I mark the billows burst in silver light. Go thou and seek the House of Prayer! I to the Woodlands shall repair, Feed with all Nature's charms mine eyes, And hear all Nature's melodies. The primrose bank will there dispense Faint fragrance to the awaken'd sense; The morning beams that life and joy impart, Will with their influence warm my heart, And the full tear that down my cheek will steal, Will speak the prayer of praise I feel. Go thou and seek the House of Prayer! I to the Woodlands bend my way, And meet Religion there! She needs not haunt the high-arch'd dome to pray, Where storied windows dim the doubtful day; At liberty she loves to rove, Wide o'er the heathy hill or cowslipt dale; Or seek the shelter of the embowering grove, Or with the streamlet wind along the vale. Sweet are these scenes to her; and when the Night Pours in the North her silver streams of light, She woos reflection in the silent gloom, And ponders on the world to come. Bristol, 1795. THE RACE OF BANQUO. A FRAGMENT. “Fly, son of Banquo! Fleance, fly! Leave thy guilty sire to die!” O'er the heath the stripling fled, The wild storm howling round his head; Fear, mightier through the shades of night, Urged his feet, and wing'd his flight; And still he heard his father's cry, “Fly, son of Banquo! Fleance, fly!” “Fly, son of Banquo! Fleance, fly! Leave thy guilty sire to die!” On every blast was heard the moan, The anguish'd shriek, the death-fraught groan; Loathly night-hags join the yell, And lo! — the midnight rites of Hell! “Forms of magic! spare my life!” Shield me from the murderer's knife! Before me dim in lurid light Float the phantoms of the night— Behind I hear my Father cry, Fly, son of Banquo — Fleance, fly!” “Parent of the sceptred race, Boldly tread the circled space; Boldly, Fleance, venture near, Sire of monarchs, spurn at fear. Sisters, with prophetic breath, Pour we now the dirge of Death!” Oxford, 1793. WRITTEN IN ALENTEJO, January 23. 1796. 1. When at morn, the Muleteer With early call announces day, Sorrowing that early call I hear, Which scares the visions of delight away: For dear to me the silent hour When sleep exerts its wizard power, And busy Fancy then let free, Borne on the wings of Hope, my Edith, flies to thee. 2. When the slant sunbeams crest The mountain's shadowy breast; When on the upland slope Shines the green myrtle wet with morning dew, And lovely as the youthful dreams of Hope, The dim-seen landscape opens on the view. I gaze around with raptured eyes On Nature's charms, where no illusion lies, And drop the joy and memory mingled tear, And sigh to think that Edith is not here. 3. At the cool hour of even, When all is calm and still, And o'er the western hill A richer radiance robes the mellow'd heaven, Absorb'd in darkness thence, When slowly fades in night The dim decaying light, Like the fair day-dreams of Benevolence; Fatigued, and sad, and slow Along my lonely way I go, And muse upon the distant day, And sigh, remembering Edith far away. 4. When late arriving at our inn of rest, Whose roof, exposed to many a winter's sky, Half shelters from the wind the shivering guest; By the lamp's melancholy gloom, I see the miserable room, And musing on the evils that arise From disproportion'd inequalities, Pray that my lot may be Neither with Riches, nor with Poverty, But in that happy mean, Which for the soul is best, And with contentment blest, In some secluded glen To dwell with Peace and Edith far from men. TO RECOVERY. Recovery, where art thou? Daughter of Heaven, where shall we seek thy help? Upon what hallow'd fountain hast thou laid, O Nymph adored, thy spell? By the grey ocean's verge, Daughter of Heaven, we seek thee, but in vain; We find no healing in the breeze that sweeps The thymy mountain's brow. Where are the happy hours, The sunshine where that cheer'd the morn of life! For Health is fled, and with her fled the joys Which made existence dear. I saw the distant hills Smile in the radiance of the orient beam, And gazed delighted that anon our feet Should visit scenes so fair. I look'd abroad at noon, The shadow and the storm were on the hills; The crags which like a faery fabric shone Darkness had overcast. On you, ye coming years, So fairly shone the April gleam of hope; So darkly o'er the distance, late so bright, Now settle the black clouds. Come thou and chase away Sorrow and Pain, the persecuting Powers Who make the melancholy day so long, So long the restless night. Shall we not find thee here, Recovery, on the salt sea's breezy strand? Is there no healing in the gales that sweep The thymy mountain's brow? I look for thy approach, O life-preserving Power! as one who strays Alone in darkness o'er the pathless marsh, Watches the dawn of day. Minehead, July, 1799. YOUTH AND AGE. With cheerful step the traveller Pursues his early way, When first the dimly-dawning east Reveals the rising day. He bounds along his craggy road, He hastens up the height, And all he sees and all he hears Administer delight. And if the mist, retiring slow, Roll round its wavy white, He thinks the morning vapours hide Some beauty from his sight. But when behind the western clouds Departs the fading day, How wearily the traveller Pursues his evening way! Sorely along the craggy road His painful footsteps creep, And slow, with many a feeble pause, He labours up the steep. And if the mists of night close round, They fill his soul with fear; He dreads some unseen precipice, Some hidden danger near. So cheerfully does youth begin Life's pleasant morning stage; Alas! the evening traveller feels The fears of wary age! Westhury, 1798. THE OAK OF OUR FATHERS. Alas for the Oak of our Fathers, that stood In its beauty, the glory and pride of the wood! It grew and it flourish'd for many an age, And many a tempest wreak'd on it its rage; But when its strong branches were bent with the blast, It struck its root deeper, and flourish'd more fast. Its head tower'd on high, and its branches spread round; For its roots had struck deep, and its heart was sound; The bees o'er its honey-dew'd foliage play'd, And the beasts of the forest fed under its shade. The Oak of our Fathers to Freedom was dear, Its leaves were her crown, and its wood was her spear. Alas for the Oak of our Fathers, that stood In its beauty, the glory and pride of the wood! There crept up an ivy and clung round the trunk, It struck in its mouths and the juices it drunk; The branches grew sickly, deprived of their food, And the Oak was no longer the pride of the wood. The foresters saw and they gather'd around, The roots still were fast, and the heart still was sound; They lopt off the boughs that so beautiful spread, But the ivy they spared on its vitals that fed. No longer the bees o'er its honey-dews play'd, Nor the beasts of the forest fed under its shade; Lopt and mangled the trunk in its ruin is seen, A monument now what its beauty has been The Oak has received its incurable wound, They have loosen'd the roots, though the heart may be sound; What the travellers at distance green-flourishing see, Are the leaves of the ivy that poison'd the tree. Alas for the Oak of our Fathers, that stood In its beauty, the glory and pride of the wood! Westbury, 1798. THE BATTLE OF PULTOWA. On Vorska's glittering waves The morning sunbeams play; Pultowa's walls are throng'd With eager multitudes; Athwart the dusty vale They strain their aching eyes, Where to the fight moves on The Conqueror Charles, the iron-hearted Swede. Him Famine hath not tamed, The tamer of the brave. Him Winter hath not quell'd; When man by man his veteran troops sunk down, Frozen to their endless sleep, He held undaunted on. Him Pain hath not subdued; What though he mounts not now The fiery steed of war, Borne on a litter to the field he goes. Go, iron-hearted King! Full of thy former fame. Think how the humbled Dane Crouch'd underneath thy sword; Think how the wretched Pole Resign'd his conquer'd crown; Go, iron-hearted King! Let Narva's glory swell thy haughty breast, . . The death-day of thy glory, Charles, hath dawn'd! Proud Swede, the Sun hath risen That on thy shame shall set! Now, Patkul, may thine injured spirit rest! For over that relentless Swede Ruin hath raised his unrelenting arm; For ere the night descends, His veteran host destroyed, His laurels blasted to revive no more, He flies before the Moscovite. Impatiently that haughty heart must bear Long years of hope deceived; Long years of idleness That sleepless soul must brook. Now, Patkul, may thine injured spirit rest! To him who suffers in an honest cause No death is ignominious; not on thee, But upon Charles, the cruel, the unjust, Not upon thee, . . on him The ineffaceable reproach is fix'd, The infamy abides. Now, Patkul, may thine injured spirit rest. Westbury, 1798. THE TRAVELLER'S RETURN. Sweet to the morning traveller The song amid the sky, Where twinkling in the dewy light The skylark soars on high. And cheering to the traveller The gales that round him play, When faint and heavily he drags Along his noon-tide way. And when beneath the unclouded sun Full wearily toils he, The flowing water makes to him A soothing melody. And when the evening light decays, And all is calm around, There is sweet music to his ear In the distant sheep-bell's sound. But oh! of all delightful sounds Of evening or of morn, The sweetest is the voice of Love, That welcomes his return. Westbury, 1798. THE OLD MAN'S COMFORTS, AND HOW HE GAINED THEM. You are old, Father William the young man cried, The few locks which are left you are grey; You are hale, Father William, a hearty old man, Now tell me the reason, I pray. In the days of my youth, Father William replied I remember'd that youth would fly fast, And abused not my health and my vigour at first, That I never might need them at last. You are old, Father William, the young man cried, And pleasures with youth pass away; And yet you lament not the days that are gone, Now tell me the reason, I pray. In the days of my youth, Father William replied, I remember'd that youth could not last; I thought of the future, whatever I did, That I never might grieve for the past. You are old, Father William, the young man cried, And life must be hastening away; You are cheerful, and love to converse upon death, Now tell me the reason, I pray. I am cheerful, young man, Father William replied, Let the cause thy attention engage; In the days of my youth I remember'd my God! And He hath not forgotten my age. Westbury, 1799. TRANSLATION OF A GREEK ODE ON ASTRONOMY WRITTEN BY S. T. COLERIDGE, FOR THE PRIZE AT CAMBRIDGE, 1793. 1. Hail, venerable Night! O first-created, hail! Thou who art doom'd in thy dark breast to veil The dying beam of light, The eldest and the latest thou, Hail, venerable Night! Around thine ebon brow, Glittering plays with lightning rays A wreath of flowers of fire. The varying clouds with many a hue attire Thy many-tinted veil. Holy are the blue graces of thy zone! But who is he whose tongue can tell The dewy lustres which thine eyes adorn? Lovely to some the blushes of the morn; To some the glories of the Day, When, blazing with meridian ray, The gorgeous Sun ascends his highest throne; But I with solemn and severe delight Still watch thy constant car, immortal Night! 2. For then to the celestial Palaces Urania leads, Urania, she The Goddess who alone Stands by the blazing throne, Effulgent with the light of Deity. Whom Wisdom, the Creatrix, by her side Placed on the heights of yonder sky, And smiling with ambrosial love, unlock'd The depths of Nature to her piercing eye. Angelic myriads struck their harps around, And with triumphant song The host of Stars, a beauteous throng, Around the ever-living Mind In jubilee their mystic dance begun; When at thy leaping forth, O Sun! The Morning started in affright, Astonish'd at thy birth, her Child of Light! 3. Hail, O Urania, hail! Queen of the Muses! Mistress of the Song! For thou didst deign to leave the heavenly throng. As earthward thou thy steps wert bending, A ray went forth and harbinger'd thy way: All Ether laugh'd with thy descending. Thou hadst wreath'd thy hair with roses, The flower that in the immortal bower Its deathless bloom discloses. Before thine awful mien, compelled to shrink, Fled Ignorance abash'd with all her brood Dragons, and Hags of baleful breath, Fierce Dreams, that wont to drink The Sepulchre's black blood; Or on the wings of storms Riding in fury forms, Shriek to the mariner the shriek of Death. 4. I boast, O Goddess, to thy name That I have raised the pile of fame; Therefore to me be given To roam the starry path of Heaven, To charioteer with wings on high, And to rein-in the Tempests of the sky. 5. Chariots of happy Gods! Fountains of Light! Ye Angel-Temples bright! May I unblamed your flamy thresholds tread? I leave Earth's lowly scene; I leave the Moon serene, The lovely Queen of Night; I leave the wide domains, Beyond where Mars his fiercer light can fling, And Jupiter's vast plains, (The many belted king;) Even to the solitude where Saturn reigns, Like some stern tyrant to just exile driven; Dim-seen the sullen power appears In that cold solitude of Heaven, And slow he drags along The mighty circle of long-lingering years. 6. Nor shalt thou escape my sight, Who at the threshold of the sun-trod domes Art trembling, . . youngest Daughter of the Night! And you, ye fiery-tressed strangers! you, Comets who wander wide, Will I along your pathless way pursue, Whence bending I may view The Worlds whom elder Suns have vivified. 7. For Hope with loveliest visions soothes my mind, That even in Man, Life's winged power, When comes again the natal hour, Shall on heaven-wandering feet In undecaying youth, Spring to the blessed seat; Where round the fields of Truth The fiery Essences for ever feed; And o'er the ambrosial mead, The breezes of serenity Silent and soothing glide for ever by. 8. There, Priest of Nature! dost thou shine, Newton! a King among the Kings divine. Whether with harmony's mild force, He guides along its course The axle of some beauteous star on high, Or gazing, in the spring Ebullient with creative energy, Feels his pure breast with rapturous joy possest, Inebriate in the holy ecstasy. 9. I may not call thee mortal then, my soul! Immortal longings lift thee to the skies: Love of thy native home inflames thee now, With pious madness wise. Know then thyself! expand thy wings divine! Soon mingled with thy fathers thou shalt shine A star amid the starry throng, A God the Gods among. London, 1802. GOOSEBERRY-PIE. A PINDARIC ODE. 1. Gooseberry-Pie is best. Full of the theme, O Muse, begin the song! What though the sunbeams of the West Mature within the Turtle's breast Blood glutinous and fat of verdant hue? What though the Deer bound sportively along O'er springey turf, the Park's elastic vest? Give them their honours due, . . But Gooseberry-Pie is best. 2. Behind his oxen slow The patient Ploughman plods, And as the Sower followed by the clods Earth's genial womb received the living seed. The rains descend, the grains they grow; Saw ye the vegetable ocean Roll its green ripple to the April gale? The golden waves with multitudinous motion Swell o'er the summer vale? 3. It flows through Alder banks along Beneath the copse that hides the hill; The gentle stream you cannot see, You only hear its melody, The stream that turns the Mill. Pass on a little way, pass on, And you shall catch its gleam anon; And hark! the loud and agonizing groan That makes its anguish known, Where tortured by the Tyrant Lord of Meal. The Brook is broken on the Wheel! 4. Blow fair, blow fair, thou orient gale! On the white bosom of the sail Ye Winds enamour'd lingering lie! Ye Waves of ocean spare the bark, Ye Tempests of the sky! From distant realms she comes to bring The sugar for my Pie. For this on Gambia's arid side The Vulture's feet are scaled with blood, And Beelzebub beholds with pride, His darling planter brood. 5. First in the spring thy leaves were seen, Thou beauteous bush, so early green! Soon ceased thy blossoms' little life of love. O safer than the gold-fruit-bearing tree The glory of that old Hesperian grove, . . No Dragon does there need for thee With quintessential sting to work alarms, Prepotent guardian of thy fruitage fine, Thou vegetable Porcupine! . . . And didst thou scratch thy tender arms, O Jane! that I should dine! 6. The flour, the sugar, and the fruit, Commingled well, how well they suit, And they were well bestow'd. O Jane, with truth I praise your Pie And will not you in just reply Praise my Pindaric Ode? Exeter, 1799. TO A BEE. 1 Thou wert out betimes, thou busy, busy Bee! As abroad I took my early way, Before the Cow from her resting-place Had risen up and left her trace On the meadow, with dew so gray, Saw I thee, thou busy, busy Bee. 2 Thou wert working late, thou busy, busy Bee! After the fall of the Cistus flower, When the Primrose-of-evening was ready to burst, I heard thee last, as I saw thee first; In the silence of the evening hour, Heard I thee, thou busy, busy Bee. 3 Thou art a miser, thou busy, busy Bee! Late and early at employ; Still on thy golden stores intent, Thy summer in heaping and hoarding is spent What thy winter will never enjoy; Wise lesson this for me, thou busy, busy Bee! 4 Little dost thou think, thou busy, busy Bee! What is the end of thy toil. When the latest flowers of the ivy are gone, And all thy work for the year is done, Thy master comes for the spoil. Woe then for thee, thou busy, busy Bee! Westbury, 1799. TO A SPIDER. 1 Spider! thou need'st not run in fear about To shun my curious eyes; I won't humanely crush thy bowels out Lest thou should'st eat the flies; Nor will I roast thee with a damn'd delight Thy strange instinctive fortitude to see, For there is One who might One day roast me. 2 Thou art welcome to a Rhymer sore-perplext, The subject of his verse; There's many a one who on a better text Perhaps might comment worse. Then shrink not, old Free-Mason, from my view, But quietly like me spin out the line; Do thou thy work pursue As I will mine. 3 Weaver of snares, thou emblemest the ways Of Satan, Sire of lies; Hell's huge black Spider, for mankind he lays His toils, as thou for flies. When Betty's busy eye runs round the room, Woe to that nice geometry, if seen! But where is he whose broom The earth shall clean? 4 Spider! of old thy flimsy webs were thought, And 'twas a likeness true, To emblem laws in which the weak are caught, But which the strong break through: And if a victim in thy toils is ta'en, Like some poor client is that wretched fly; I'll warrant thee thou 'lt drain His life-blood dry. 5 And is not thy weak work like human schemes And care on earth employ'd? Such are young hopes and Love's delightful dreams So easily destroy'd! So does the Statesman, whilst the Avengers sleep, Self-deem'd secure, his wiles in secret lay, Soon shall destruction sweep His work away. 6 Thou busy labourer! one resemblance more May yet the verse prolong, For, Spider, thou art like the Poet poor, Whom thou hast help'd in song. Both busily our needful food to win, We work, as Nature taught, with ceaseless pains; Thy bowels thou dost spin, I spin my brains. Westbury, 1798. THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM. The rage of Babylon is roused, The King puts forth his strength; And Judah bends the bow And points her arrows for the coming war. Her walls are firm, her gates are strong, Her youth gird on the sword; High are her chiefs in hope, For soon will Egypt send the promised aid. But who is he whose voice of woe Is heard amid the streets? Whose ominous voice proclaims Her strength and arms and promised succours vain. His meagre cheek is pale and sunk, Wild is his hollow eye, Yet aweful is its glance; And who could bear the anger of his frown? Prophet of God! in vain thy lips Proclaim the woe to come; In vain thy warning voice Summons her rulers timely to repent! The Ethiop changes not his skin. Impious and reckless still The rulers spurn thy voice, And now the measure of their crimes is full. For now around Jerusalem The countless foes appear; Far as the eye can reach Spreads the wide horror of the circling siege. Why is the warrior's cheek so pale? Why droops the gallant youth Who late in pride of heart Sharpen'd his javelin for the welcome war? 'Tis not for terror that his eye Swells with the struggling woe; Oh! he could bear his ills, Or rush to death, and in the grave have peace. His parents do not ask for food, But they are weak with want; His wife has given her babes Her wretched pittance, . . she makes no complaint. The consummating hour is come! Alas for Solyma! How is she desolate, . . She that was great among the nations, fallen! And thou.. thou miserable King.. Where is thy trusted flock, Thy flock so beautiful, Thy Father's throne, the temple of thy God? Repentance brings not back the past; It will not call again Thy murder'd sons to life, Nor vision to those eyeless sockets more. Thou wretched, childless, blind, old man, Heavy thy punishment; Dreadful thy present woes, Alas more dreadful thy remember'd guilt! Westbury, 1798. THE DEATH OF WALLACE. Joy, joy in London now! He goes, the rebel Wallace goes to death; At length the traitor meets the traitor's doom, Joy, joy, in London now! He on a sledge is drawn, His strong right arm unweapon'd and in chains, And garlanded around his helmless head The laurel wreath of scorn. They throng to view him now Who in the field had fled before his sword, Who at the name of Wallace once grew pale And falter'd out a prayer. Yes! they can meet his eye, That only beams with patient courage now; Yes! they can look upon those manly limbs, Defenceless now and bound. And that eye did not shrink As he beheld the pomp of infamy; Nor one ungovern'd feeling shook those limbs, When the last moment came. What though suspended sense Was by their legal cruelty revived; What though ingenious vengeance lengthen'd life To feel protracted death; What though the hangman's hand Graspt in his living breast the heaving heart, . . In the last agony, the last sick pang, Wallace had comfort still. He call'd to mind his deeds Done for his country in the embattled field; He thought of that good cause for which he died, And it was joy in death. Go, Edward! triumph now! Cambria is fallen, and Scotland's strength is crush'd On Wallace, on Llewellyn's mangled limbs, The fowls of Heaven have fed. Unrivall'd, unopposed, Go, Edward, full of glory to thy grave! The weight of patriot blood upon thy soul, Go, Edward, to thy God! Westbury, 1798. THE SPANISH ARMADA. Clear shone the morn, the gale was fair, When from Coruña's crowded port With many a cheerful shout and loud acclaim The huge Armada past. To England's shores their streamers point, To England's shores their sails are spread. They go to triumph o'er the sea-girt land, And Rome hath blest their arms. Along the ocean's echoing verge, Along the mountain range of rocks, The clustering multitudes behold their pomp, And raise the votive prayer. Commingling with the ocean's roar Ceaseless and hoarse their murmurs rise, And soon they trust to see the winged bark That bears good tidings home. The watch-tower now in distance sinks, And now Galicia's mountain rocks Faint as the far-off clouds of evening lie, And now they fade away. Each like some moving citadel, On through the waves they sail sublime; And now the Spaniards see the silvery cliffs, Behold the sea-girt land! O fools! to think that ever foe Should triumph o'er that sea-girt land! O fools! to think that ever Britain's sons Should wear the stranger's yoke! For not in vain hath Nature rear'd Around her coast those silvery cliffs; For not in vain old Ocean spreads his waves To guard his favourite isle! On come her gallant mariners! What now avail Rome's boasted charms? Where are the Spaniard's vaunts of eager wrath? His hopes of conquest now? And hark! the angry Winds arise, Old Ocean heaves his angry Waves; The Winds and Waves, against the invaders fight To guard the sea-girt land. Howling around his palace-towers The Spanish despot hears the storm; He thinks upon his navies far away, And boding doubts arise. Long, over Biscay's boisterous surge The watchman's aching eye shall strain! Long shall he gaze, but never wing'd bark Shall bear good tidings home. Westbury, 1798. ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY. The night is come, no fears disturb The dreams of innocence; They trust in kingly faith and kingly oaths, They sleep, . . alas! they sleep! Go to the palace, would'st thou know How hideous night can be; Eye is not closed in those accursed walls, Nor heart at quiet there. The Monarch from the window leans, He listens to the night, And with a horrible and eager hope Awaits the midnight bell. Oh he has Hell within him now! God, always art thou just! For innocence can never know such pangs As pierce successful guilt. He looks abroad, and all is still. Hark! . . now the midnight bell Sounds through the silence of the night alone, . . And now the signal gun! Thy hand is on him, righteous God! He hears the frantic shrieks, He hears the glorying yells of massacre, And he repents, . . too late. He hears the murderer's savage shout, He hears the groan of death; In vain they fly, . . soldiers defenceless now, Women, old men, and babes. Righteous and just art thou, O God! For at his dying hour Those shrieks and groans re-echoed in his ear, He heard that murderous yell! They throng'd around his midnight couch, The phantoms of the slain; . . It prey'd like poison on his powers of life; Righteous art thou, O God! Spirits! who suffer'd at that hour For freedom and for faith, Ye saw your country bent beneath the yoke, Her faith and freedom crush'd. And like a giant from his sleep Ye saw when France awoke; Ye saw the people burst their double chain, And ye had joy in Heaven! Westbury, 1798. THE HOLLY TREE. 1 O Reader! hast thou ever stood to see The Holly Tree? The eye that contemplates it well perceives Its glossy leaves Order'd by an intelligence so wise, As might confound the Atheist's sophistries. 2 Below, a circling fence, its leaves are seen Wrinkled and keen; No grazing cattle through their prickly round Can reach to wound; But as they grow where nothing is to fear, Smooth and unarm'd the pointless leaves appear. 3 I love to view these things with curious eyes, And moralize: And in this wisdom of the Holly Tree Can emblems see Wherewith perchance to make a pleasant rbyme, One which may profit in the after time. 4 Thus, though abroad perchance I might appear Harsh and austere, To those who on my leisure would intrude Reserved and rude, Gentle at home amid my friends I'd be Like the high leaves upon the Holly Tree. 5 And should my youth, as youth is apt I know, Some harshness show, All vain asperities I day by day Would wear away, Till the smooth temper of my age should be Like the high leaves upon the Holly Tree. 6 And as when all the summer trees are seen So bright and green, The Holly leaves a sober hue display Less bright than they, But when the bare and wintry woods we see, What then so cheerful as the Holly Tree? 7 So scrious should my youth appear among The thoughtless throng, So would I seem amid the young and gay More grave than they, That in my age as cheerful I might be As the green winter of the Holly Tree. Westbury, 1798. THE EBB TIDE. Slowly thy flowing tide Came in, old Avon! scarcely did mine eyes, As watchfully I roam'd thy green-wood side, Perceive its gentle rise. With many a stroke and strong The labouring boatmen upward plied their oars, Yet little way they made, though labouring long Between thy winding shores. Now down thine ebbing tide The unlabour'd boat falls rapidly along; The solitary helm's-man sits to guide, And sings an idle song. Now o'er the rocks that lay So silent late, the shallow current roars; Fast flow thy waters on their seaward way Through wider-spreading shores. Avon! I gaze and know The lesson emblem'd in thy varying way; It speaks of human joys that rise so slow, So rapidly decay. Kingdoms which long have stood, And slow to strength and power attain'd at last, Thus from the summit of high fortune's flood They ebb to ruin fast. Thus like thy flow appears Time's tardy course to manhood's envied stage; Alas! how hurryingly the ebbing years Then hasten to old age! Westbury, 1798. THE COMPLAINTS OF THE POOR. And wherefore do the Poor complain? The Rich Man ask'd of me; . . . Come walk abroad with me, I said, And I will answer thee. 'Twas evening, and the frozen streets Were cheerless to behold, And we were wrapt and coated well, And yet we were a-cold. We met an old bare-headed man, His locks were thin and white; I ask'd him what he did abroad In that cold winter's night; The cold was keen indeed, he said, But at home no fire had he, And therefore he had come abroad To ask for charity. We met a young bare-footed child, And she begg'd loud and bold; I ask'd her what she did abroad When the wind it blew so cold; She said her father was at home, And he lay sick a-bed, And therefore was it she was sent Abroad to beg for bread. We saw a woman sitting down Upon a stone to rest, She had a baby at her back And another at her breast; I ask'd her why she loiter'd there When the night-wind was so chill; She turn'd her head and bade the child That scream'd behind, be still; Then told us that her husband served, A soldier, far away, And therefore to her parish she Was begging back her way. We met a girl, her dress was loose And sunken was her eye, Who with a wanton's hollow voice Address'd the passers-by; I ask'd her what there was in guilt That could her heart allure To shame, disease, and late remorse; She answer'd she was poor. I turn'd me to the Rich Man then, For silently stood he, . . . You ask'd me why the Poor complain, And these have answer'd thee! London, 1798. TO MARY Mary! ten chequer'd years have past Since we beheld each other last; Yet, Mary, I remember thee, Nor canst thou have forgotten me. The bloom was then upon thy face, Thy form had every youthful grace; I too had then the warmth of youth, And in our hearts was all its truth. We conversed, were there others by, With common mirth and random eye; But when escaped the sight of men, How serious was our converse then! Our talk was then of years to come, Of hopes which ask'd a humble doom, Themes which to loving thoughts might move, Although we never spake of love. At our last meeting sure thy heart Was even as loth as mine to part; And yet we little thought that then We parted... not to meet again. Long, Mary! after that adieu, My dearest day-dreams were of you; In sleep I saw you still, and long Made you the theme of secret song. When manhood and its cares came on, The humble hopes of youth were gone; And other hopes and other fears Effaced the thoughts of happier years. Meantime through many a varied year Of thee no tidings did I hear, And thou hast never heard my name Save from the vague reports of fame. But then I trust detraction's lie Hath kindled anger in thine eye; And thou my praise wert proud to see, . . . My name should still be dear to thee. Ten years have held their course; thus late I learn the tidings of thy fate; A Husband and a Father now, Of thee, a Wife and Mother thou. And, Mary, as for thee I frame A prayer which hath no selfish aim, No happier lot can I wish thee Than such as Heaven hath granted me. London, 1802. TO A FRIEND, INQUIRING IF I WOULD LIVE OVER MY YOUTH AGAIN. 1. Do I regret the past? Would I again live o'er The morning hours of life? Nay, William! nay, not so! In the warm joyance of the summer sun I do not wish again The changeful April day. Nay, William! nay, not so! Safe haven'd from the sea, I would not tempt again The uncertain ocean's wrath. Praise be to Him who made me what I am, Other I would not be. 2. Why is it pleasant then to sit and talk Of days that are no more? When in his own dear home The traveller rests at last, And tells how often in his wanderings The thought of those far off Hath made his eyes o'erflow With no unmanly tears; Delighted he recalls Through what fair scenes his lingering feet have trod; But ever when he tells of perils past And troubles now no more, His eyes are brightest, and a readier joy Flows thankful from his heart. 3. No, William! no, I would not live again The morning hours of life; I would not be again The slave of hope and fear; I would not learn again The wisdom by Experience hardly taught. 4. To me the past presents No object for regret; To me the present gives All cause for full content. The future? . . . it is now the cheerful noon, And on the sunny-smiling fields I gaze With eyes alive to joy; When the dark night descends, I willingly shall close my weary lids, In sure and certain hope to wake again. Westbury, 1798. THE DEAD FRIEND. 1. Not to the grave, not to the grave, my Soul, Descend to contemplate The form that once was dear! The Spirit is not there Which kindled that dead eye, Which throbb'd in that cold heart, Which in that motionless hand Hath met thy friendly grasp. The Spirit is not there! It is but lifeless perishable flesh That moulders in the grave; Earth, air, and water's ministering particles Now to the elements Resolved, their uses done. Not to the grave, not to the grave, my Soul, Follow thy friend beloved, The Spirit is not there! 2. Often together have we talk'd of death; How sweet it were to see All doubtful things made clear; How sweet it were with powers Such as the Cherubim, To view the depth of Heaven! O Edmund! thou hast first Begun the travel of Eternity! I look upon the stars, And think that thou art there, Unfetter'd as the thought that follows thee. 3. And we have often said how sweet it were With unseen ministry of angel power To watch the friends we loved. Edmund! we did not err! Sure I have felt thy presence! Thou hast given A birth to holy thought, Hast kept me from the world unstain'd and pure. Edmund! we did not err! Our best affections here They are not like the toys of infancy; The Soul outgrows them not; We do not cast them off; Oh if it could be so, It were indeed a dreadful thing to die! 4. Not to the grave, not to the grave, my Soul, Follow thy friend beloved! But in the lonely hour, But in the evening walk, Think that he companies thy solitude; Think that he holds with thee Mysterious intercourse; And though remembrance wake a tear, There will be joy in grief. Westbury, 1799. SONGS OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS. THE HURON'S ADDRESS TO THE DEAD. 1. Brother, thou wert strong in youth! Brother, thou wert brave in war! Unhappy man was he For whom thou hadst sharpen'd the tomahawk's edge! Unhappy man was he On whom thine angry eye was fix'd in fight! And he who from thy hand Received the calumet, Blest Heaven, and slept in peace. 2. When the Evil Spirits seized thee, Brother, we were sad at heart: We bade the Jongler come And bring his magic aid; We circled thee in mystic dance, With songs and shouts and cries, To free thee from their power. Brother, but in vain we strove, The number of thy days was full. 3. Thou sittest amongst us on thy mat, The bear-skin from thy shoulder hangs, Thy feet are sandal'd ready for the way. Those are the unfatigueable feet That traversed the forest track; Those are the lips that late Thunder'd the yell of war; And that is the strong right arm Which never was lifted in vain. Those lips are silent now, The limbs that were active are stiff, Loose hangs the strong right arm! 4. And where is That which in thy voice The language of friendship spake? That gave the strength of thine arm? That fill'd thy limbs with life? It was not Thou, for Thou art here, Thou art amongst us still, But the Life and the Feeling are gone. The Iroquois will learn That thou hast ceased from war; 'Twill be a joy like victory to them, For thou wert the scourge of their nation. 5. Brother, we sing thee the song of death; In thy coffin of bark we lay thee to rest; The bow shall be placed by thy side, And the shafts that are pointed and feather'd for flight To the country of the Dead Long and painful is thy way; Over rivers wide and deep Lies the road that must be past, By bridges narrow-wall'd, Where scarce the Soul can force its way, While the loose fabric totters under it. 6. Safely may our brother pass! Safely may he reach the fields, Where the sound of the drum and the shell Shall be heard from the Country of Souls! The Spirits of thy Sires Shall come to welcome thee: The God of the Dead in his Bower Shall receive thee, and bid thee join The dance of eternal joy. 7. Brother, we pay thee the rites of death, Rest in thy Bower of Delight! Westbury, 1799. THE PERUVIAN'S DIRGE OVER THE BODY OF HIS FATHER. 1. Rest in peace, my Father, rest! With danger and toil have I borne thy corpse From the Stranger's field of death. I bless thee, O Wife of the Sun, For veiling thy beams with a cloud, While at the pious task Thy votary toil'd in fear. Thou badest the clouds of night Enwrap thee, and hide thee from Man; But didst thou not see my toil, And put on the darkness to aid, O Wife of the visible God? 2. Wretched, my Father, thy life! Wretched the life of the Slave! All day for another he toils; Overwearied at night he lies down, And dreams of the freedom that once he enjoy'd. Thou wert blest in the days of thy youth My Father! for then thou wert free. In the fields of the nation thy hand Bore its part of the general task; And when with the song and the dance, Ye brought the harvest home, As all in the labour had shared, So justly they shared in the fruits. 3. Thou visible Lord of the Earth, Thou God of my Fathers, thou God of my heart, O Giver of light and of life! When the Strangers came to our shores, Why didst thou not put forth thy power? Thy thunders should then have been hurl'd, Thy fires should in lightnings have flash'd! . . Visible God of the Earth, The Strangers mock at thy might! To idols and beams of wood They force us to bow the knee; They plunge us in caverns and dens, Where never thy blessed light Shines on our poisonous toil! But not in the caverns and dens, O Sun, are we mindless of thee! We pine for the want of thy beams, We adore thee with anguish and groans. 4. My Father, rest in peace! Rest with the dust of thy Sires! They placed their Cross in thy dying grasp; . . . They bore thee to their burial-place, And over thy breathless frame Their bloody and merciless Priest Mumbled his magic hastily. Oh! could thy bones be at peace In the field where the Strangers are laid? . . . Alone, in danger and in pain, My Father, I bring thee here: So may our God, in reward, Allow me one faithful friend To lay me beside thee when I am released! So may he summon me soon, That my Spirit may join thee there, Where the strangers never shall come! Exeter, 1799. SONG OF THE ARAUCANS DURING A THUNDER STORM. The storm-cloud grows deeper above; Araucans! the tempest is ripe in the sky; Our forefathers come from their Islands of Bliss, They come to the war of the winds. The Souls of the Strangers are there, In their garments of darkness they ride through the heaven; Yon cloud that rolls luridly over the hill Is red with their weapons of fire. Hark! hark! in the howl of the wind The shout of the battle, the clang of their drums; The horsemen are met, and the shock of the fight Is the blast that disbranches the wood. Behold from the clouds of their power The lightning, . . the lightning is lanced at our sires! And the thunder that shakes the broad pavement of Heaven! And the darkness that quenches the day! Ye Souls of our Fathers, be brave! Ye shrunk not before the invaders on earth, Ye trembled not then at their weapons of fire; Brave Spirits, ye tremble not now! We gaze on your warfare in hope, We send up our shouts to encourage your arms! Lift the lance of your vengeance, O Fathers, with force, For the wrongs of your country strike home! Remember the land was your own When the Sons of Destruction came over the seas; That the old fell asleep in the fullness of days, And their children wept over their graves. Till the Strangers came into the land With tongues of deceit and with weapons of fire: Then the strength of the people in youth was cut off, And the father wept over his son. It thickens.. the tumult of fight! Louder and louder the blast of the battle is heard! . . Remember the wrongs that your country endures! Remember the fields of your fame! Joy! joy! for the Strangers recoil, . . They give way, . . they retreat, . . they are routed, . . they fly; Pursue them! pursue them! remember your wrongs! Let your lances be drunk with their wounds. The Souls of your wives shall rejoice As they welcome you back to your Islands of Bliss; And the breeze that refreshes the toil-throbbing brow Waft thither the song of your praise. Westbury, 1799. SONG OF THE CHIKKASAH WIDOW. 'Twas the voice of my husband that came on the gale; His unappeased Spirit in anger complains; Rest, rest Ollanahta, be still! The day of revenge is at hand. The stake is made ready, the captives shall die; To-morrow the song of their death shalt thou hear, To-morrow thy widow shall wield The knife and the fire; . . be at rest! The vengeance of anguish shall soon have its course, . . The fountains of grief and of fury shall flow, . . I will think, Ollanahta! of thee, Will remember the days of our love. Ollanahta, all day by thy war-pole I sat, Where idly thy hatchet of battle is hung; I gazed on the bow of thy strength As it waved on the stream of the wind. The scalps that we number'd in triumph were there, And the musket that never was levell'd in vain, . . . What a leap has it given to my heart To see thee suspend it in peace. When the black and blood-banner was spread to the gale, When thrice the deep voice of the war-drum was heard, I remember thy terrible eyes How they flash'd the dark glance of thy joy. I remember the hope that shone over thy cheek As thy hand from the pole reach'd its doers of death; Like the ominous gleam of the cloud Ere the thunder and lightning are born. He went, and ye came not to warn him in dreams, Kindred Spirits of Him who is holy and great! And where was thy warning, O Bird, The timely announcer of ill? Alas! when thy brethren in conquest return'd; When I saw the white plumes bending over their heads, And the pine-boughs of triumph before, Where the scalps of their victory swung, . . The war-hymn they pour'd, and thy voice was not there! I call'd thee, . . alas, the white deer-skin was brought; And thy grave was prepared in the tent Which I had made ready for joy! Ollanahta, all day by thy war-pole I sit, . . Ollanahta, all night I weep over thy grave! To-morrow the victims shall die, And I shall have joy in revenge. Westbury, 1799. THE OLD CHIKKASAH TO HIS GRANDSON. 1. Now go to the battle, my Boy! Dear child of my son, There is strength in thine arm, There is hope in thy heart, Thou art ripe for the labours of war. Thy Sire was a stripling like thee When he went to the first of his fields. 2. He return'd, in the glory of conquest return'd; Before him his trophies were borne, These scalps that have hung till the Sun and the Rain Have rusted their raven locks. Here he stood when the morn of rejoicing arrived, The day of the warrior's reward; When the banners sun-beaming were spread, And all hearts were dancing in joy To the sound of the victory-drum. The Heroes were met to receive their reward; But distinguish'd among the young Heroes that day, The pride of his nation, thy Father was seen: The swan-feathers hung from his neck, His face like the rainbow was tinged, And his eye, . . how it sparkled in pride! The Elders approach'd, and they placed on his brow The crown that his valour had won, And they gave him the old honour'd name. They reported the deeds he had done in the war, And the youth of the nation were told To respect him and tread in his steps. 3. My Boy! I have seen, and with hope, The courage that rose in thine eye When I told thee the tale of his death His war-pole now is grey with moss, His tomahawk red with rust; His bowstring whose twang was death Now sings as it cuts the wind; But his memory is fresh in the land And his name with the names that we love. 4. Go now and revenge him, my Boy! That his Spirit no longer may hover by day O'er the hut where his bones are at rest, Nor trouble our dreams in the night. My Boy, I shall watch for the warriors' return, And my soul will be sad Till the steps of thy coming I see. Westbury, 1799. OCCASIONAL PIECES. I. THE PAUPER'S FUNERAL. What! and not one to heave the pious sigh? Not one whose sorrow-swoln and aching eye, For social scenes, for life's endearments fled, Shall drop a tear and dwell upon the dead? Poor wretched Outcast! I will weep for thee, And sorrow for forlorn humanity. Yes, I will weep; but not that thou art come To the cold sabbath of the silent tomb: For pining want, and heart-consuming care, Soul-withering evils, never enter there. I sorrow for the ills thy life has known, As through the world's long pilgrimage, alone, Haunted by Poverty and woe-begone, Unloved, unfriended, thou didst journey on; Thy youth in ignorance and labour past, And thine old age all barrenness and blast! Hard was thy Fate, which, while it doom'd to woe, Denied thee wisdom to support the blow; And robb'd of all its energy thy mind, Ere yet it cast thee on thy fellow-kind, Abject of thought, the victim of distress, To wander in the world's wide wilderness. Poor Outcast, sleep in peace! the wintry storm Blows bleak no more on thine unshelter'd form; Thy woes are past; thou restest in the tomb;— I pause, . . and ponder on the days to come. Bristol, 1795. II. THE SOLDIER'S FUNERAL. It is the funeral march. I did not think That there had been such magic in sweet sounds! Hark! from the blacken'd cymbal that dead tone! . . It awes the very rabble multitude; They follow silently, their earnest brows Lifted in solemn thought. 'Tis not the pomp And pageantry of death that with such force Arrests the sense; . . the mute and mourning train, The white plume nodding o'er the sable hearse, Had past unheeded, or perchance awoke A serious smile upon the poor man's cheek At pride's last triumph. Now these measured sounds, This universal language, to the heart Speak instant, and on all these various minds Compel one feeling. But such better thoughts Will pass away, how soon! and these who here Are following their dead comrade to the grave, Ere the night fall will in their revelry Quench all remembrance. From the ties of life Unnaturally rent, a man who knew No resting place, no dear delights of home, Belike who never saw his children's face, Whose children knew no father, . . he is gone, . . Dropt from existence, like a blasted leaf That from the summer tree is swept away, Its loss unseen. She hears not of his death Who bore him, and already for her son Her tears of bitterness are shed; when first He had put on the livery of blood, She wept him dead to her. We are indeed Clay in the potter's hand! One favour'd mind, Scarce lower than the Angels, shall explore The ways of Nature, whilst his fellow-man, Framed with like miracle, the work of God, Must as the unreasonable beast drag on A life of labour; like this soldier here, His wondrous faculties bestow'd in vain, Be moulded by his fate till he becomes A mere machine of murder. And there are Who say that this is well! as God has made All things for man's good pleasure, so of men The many for the few! Court-moralists, Reverend lip-comforters, that once a-week Proclaim how blessed are the poor, for they Shall have their wealth hereafter, and though now Toiling and troubled, they may pick the crumbs That from the rich man's table fall, at length In Abraham's bosom rest with Lazarus. Themselves meantime secure their good things here, And feast with Dives. These are they, O Lord! Who in thy plain and simple Gospel see All mysteries, but who find no peace enjoin'd, No brotherhood, no wrath denounced on them Who shed their brethren's blood, . . blind at noon-day As owls, lynx-eyed in darkness! O my God! I thank thee, with no Pharisaic pride I thank thee, that I am not such as these; I thank thee for the eye that sees, the heart That feels, the voice that in these evil days, Amid these evil tongues, exalts itself, And cries aloud against iniquity. Bristol, 1795. III. ON A LANDSCAPE OF GASPAR POUSSIN. Gaspar! how pleasantly thy pictured scenes Beguile the lonely hour! I sit and gaze With lingering eye, till dreaming Fancy makes The lovely landscape live, and the rapt soul From the foul haunts of herded human-kind Flies far away with spirit speed, and tastes The untainted air, that with the lively hue Of health and happiness illumes the cheek Of mountain Liberty. My willing soul All eager follows on thy faery flights, Fancy! best friend; whose blessed witcheries With cheering prospects cheat the traveller O'er the long wearying desert of the world. Nor dost thou, Fancy! with such magic mock My heart, as, demon-born, old Merlin knew, Or Alquif, or Zarzafiel's sister sage, Who in her vengeance for so many a year Held in the jacinth sepulchre entranced Lisuart the pride of Grecian chivalry. Friend of my lonely hours! thou leadest me To such calm joys as Nature, wise and good, Proffers in vain to all her wretched sons, . . Her wretched sons who pine with want amid The abundant earth, and blindly bow them down Before the Moloch shrines of Wealth and Power Authors of Evil. Well it is sometimes That thy delusions should beguile the heart, Sick of reality. The little pile That tops the summit of that craggy hill Shall be my dwelling: craggy is the hill And steep; yet through yon hazels upward leads The easy path, along whose winding way Now close embower'd I hear the unseen stream Dash down, anon behold its sparkling foam Gleam through the thicket; and ascending on Now pause me to survey the goodly vale That opens on my prospect. Half way up Pleasant it were upon some broad smooth rock To sit and sun myself, and look below, And watch the goatherd down yon high-bank'd path Urging his flock grotesque; and bidding now His lean rough dog from some near cliff go drive The straggler; while his barkings loud and quick Amid their tremulous bleat arising oft, Fainter and fainter from the hollow road Send their far echoes, till the waterfall, Hoarse bursting from the cavern'd cliff beneath, Their dying murmurs drown. A little yet Onward, and I have gain'd the upmost height. Fair spreads the vale below: I see the stream Stream radiant on beneath the noontide sky A passing cloud darkens the bordering steep, Where the town-spires behind the castle-towers Rise graceful; brown the mountain in its shade, Whose circling grandeur, part by mists conceal'd, Part with white rocks resplendent in the sun, Should bound mine eyes, . . aye, and my wishes too For I would have no hope or fear beyond. The empty turmoil of the worthless world, Its vanities and vices, would not vex My quiet heart. The traveller, who beheld The low tower of the little pile, might deem It were the house of God; nor would he err So deeming, for that home would be the home Of Peace and Love, and they would hallow it To Him. Oh, life of blessedness! to reap The fruit of honourable toil, and bound Our wishes with our wants! Delightful thoughts That soothe the solitude of weary Hope, Ye leave her to reality awaked, Like the poor captive, from some fleeting dream Of friends and liberty and home restored, Startled, and listening as the midnight storm Beats hard and heavy through his dungeon bars. Bath, 1795. IV. WRITTEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY, 1795. How many hearts are happy at this hour In England! Brightly o'er the cheerful hall Flares the heaped hearth, and friends and kindred meet, And the glad mother round her festive board Beholds her children, separated long Amid the wide world's ways, assembled now, A sight at which affection lightens up With smiles, the eye that age has long bedimm'd. I do remember when I was a child How my young heart, a stranger then to care, With transport leap'd upon this holyday, As o'er the house, all gay with evergreens, From friend to friend with joyful speed I ran Bidding a merry Christmas to them all. Those years are past; their pleasures and their pains Are now like yonder convent-crested hill That bounds the distant prospect, indistinct, Yet pictured upon memory's mystic glass In faint fair hues. A weary traveller now I journey o'er the desert mountain tracks Of Leon, wilds all drear and comfortless, Where the grey lizards in the noontide sun Sport on the rocks, and where the goatherd starts, Roused from his sleep at midnight when he hears The prowling wolf, and falters as he calls On Saints to save. Here of the friends I think Who now, I ween, remember me, and fill The glass of votive friendship. At the name Will not thy cheek, Beloved, change its hue, And in those gentle eyes uncall'd-for tears Tremble? I will not wish thee not to weep; Such tears are free from bitterness, and they Who know not what it is sometimes to wake And weep at midnight, are but instruments Of Nature's common work. Yes, think of me, My Edith, think that, travelling far away, Thus I beguile the solitary hours With many a day-dream, picturing scenes as fair Of peace, and comfort, and domestic bliss As ever to the youthful poet's eye Creative Fancy fashion'd. Think of me. Though absent, thine; and if a sigh will rise, And tears, unbidden, at the thought steal down, Sure hope will cheer thee, and the happy hour Of meeting soon all sorrow overpay. V. WRITTEN AFTER VISITING THE CONVENT OF ARRABIDA, NEAR SETUBAL. March 22. 1796. Happy the dwellers in this holy house: For surely never worldly thoughts intrude On this retreat, this sacred solitude, Where Quiet with Religion makes her home. And ye who tenant such a goodly scene, How should ye be but good, where all is fair, And where the mirror of the mind reflects Serenest beauty? O'er these mountain wilds The insatiate eye with ever new delight Roams raptured, marking now where to the wind The tall tree bends its many-tinted boughs With soft accordant sound; and now the sport Of joyous sea-birds o'er the tranquil deep, And now the long-extending stream of light Where the broad orb of day refulgent sinks Beneath old Ocean's line. To have no cares That eat the heart, no wants that to the earth Chain the reluctant spirit, to be freed From forced communion with the selfish tribe Who worship Mammon,—yea, emancipate From this world's bondage, even while the soul Inhabits still its corruptible clay, . . Almost, ye dwellers in this holy house, Almost I envy you. You never see Pale Misery's asking eye, nor roam about Those huge and hateful haunts of crowded men, Where Wealth and Power have built their palaces, Fraud spreads his snares secure, man preys on man, Iniquity abounds, and rampant Vice, With an infection worse than mortal, taints The herd of humankind. I too could love, Ye tenants of this sacred solitude, Here to abide, and when the sun rides high Seek some sequestered dingle's coolest shade; And at the breezy hour, along the beach Stray with slow step, and gaze upon the deep, And while the breath of evening fann'd my brow, And the wild waves with their continuous sound Soothed my accustom'd ear, think thankfully That I had from the crowd withdrawn in time, And found an harbour... Yet may yonder deep Suggest a less unprofitable thought, Monastic brethren. Would the mariner, Though storms may sometimes swell the mighty waves, And o'er the reeling bark with thundering crash Impel the mountainous surge, quit yonder deep, And rather float upon some tranquil sea, Whose moveless waters never feel the gale, In safe stagnation? Rouse thyself my soul! No season this for self-deluding dreams; It is thy spring time; sow, if thou would'st reap Then, after honest labour, welcome rest, In full contentment not to be enjoy'd Unless when duly earn'd. Oh happy then To know that we have walked among mankind More sinn'd against than sinning! Happy then To muse on many a sorrow overpast, And think the business of the day is done, And as the evening of our lives shall close, The peaceful evening, with a Christian's hope Expect the dawn of everlasting day. Lisbon, 1796. VI. ON MY OWN MINIATURE PICTURE, TAKEN AT TWO YEARS OF AGE. And I was once like this! that glowing cheek Was mine, those pleasure-sparkling eyes; that brow Smooth as the level lake, when not a breeze Dies o'er the sleeping surface! . . Twenty years Have wrought strange alteration! Of the friends Who once so dearly prized this miniature, And loved it for its likeness, some are gone To their last home; and some, estranged in heart, Beholding me, with quick-averted glance Pass on the other side. But still these hues Remain unalter'd, and these features wear The look of Infancy and Innocence. I search myself in vain, and find no trace Of what I was: those lightly arching lines Dark and o'erhanging now; and that sweet face Settled in these strong lineaments! . . There were Who form'd high hopes and flattering ones of thee, Young Robert! for thine eye was quick to speak Each opening feeling: should they not have known, If the rich rainbow on a morning cloud Reflects its radiant dyes, the husbandman Beholds the ominous glory, and foresees Impending storms! . . They augured happily, That thou didst love each wild and wonderous tale Of faery fiction, and thine infant tongue Lisp'd with delight the godlike deeds of Greece And rising Rome; therefore they deem'd, forsooth, That thou shouldst tread Preferment's pleasant path. Ill-judging ones! they let thy little feet Stray in the pleasant paths of Poesy, And when thou shouldst have prest amid the crowd, There didst thou love to linger out the day, Loitering beneath the laurel's barren shade. Spirit of Spenser! was the wanderer wrong? Bristol, 1796. VII. ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE OLD SPANIEL. And they have drown'd thee then at last! poor Phillis! The burden of old age was heavy on thee, And yet thou should'st have lived! What though thine eye Was dim, and watch'd no more with eager joy The wonted call that on thy dull sense sunk With fruitless repetition, the warm Sun Might still have cheer'd thy slumbers; thou didst love To lick the hand that fed thee, and though past Youth's active season, even Life itself Was comfort. Poor old friend, how earnestly Would I have pleaded for thee! thou hadst been Still the companion of my boyish sports; And as I roam'd o'er Avon's woody cliffs, From many a day-dream has thy short quick bark Recall'd my wandering soul. I have beguiled Often the melancholy hours at school, Sour'd by some little tyrant, with the thought Of distant home, and I remember'd then Thy faithful fondness; for not mean the joy, Returning at the happy holydays, I felt from thy dumb welcome. Pensively Sometimes have I remark'd thy slow decay, Feeling myself changed too, and musing much On many a sad vicissitude of Life. Ah, poor companion! when thou followedst last Thy master's parting footsteps to the gate Which closed for ever on him, thou didst lose Thy truest friend, and none was left to plead For the old age of brute fidelity. But fare thee well! Mine is no narrow creed; And He who gave thee being did not frame The mystery of life to be the sport Of merciless Man. There is another world For all that live and move.. a better one! Where the proud bipeds, who would fain confine Infinite Goodness to the little bounds Of their own charity, may envy thee. Bristol, 1796. VIII. RECOLLECTIONS OF A DAY'S JOURNEY IN SPAIN. Not less delighted do I call to mind, Land of Romance, thy wild and lovely scenes, Than I beheld them first. Pleased I retrace With memory's eye the placid Minho's course, And catch its winding waters gleaming bright Amid the broken distance. I review Leon's wide wastes, and heights precipitous, Seen with a pleasure not unmix'd with dread, As the sagacious mules along the brink Wound patiently and slow their way secure; And rude Galicia's hovels, and huge rocks And mountains, where, when all beside was dim, Dark and broad-headed the tall pines erect Rose on the farthest eminence distinct, Cresting the evening sky. Rain now falls thick, And damp and heavy is the unwholesome air; I by this friendly hearth remember Spain, And tread in fancy once again the road, Where twelve months since I held my way, and thought Of England, and of all my heart held dear, And wish'd this day were come. The morning mist, Well I remember, hovered o'er the heath, When with the earliest dawn of day we left The solitary Venta. Venta de Peralbanegas. Soon the Sun Rose in his glory; scatter'd by the breeze The thin fog roll'd away, and now emerged We saw where Oropesa's castled hill Tower'd dark, and dimly seen; and now we pass'd Torvalva's quiet huts, and on our way Paused frequently, look'd back, and gazed around, Then journey'd on, yet turn'd and gazed again, So lovely was the scene. That ducal pile Of the Toledos now with all its towers Shone in the sunlight. Half way up the hill, Embower'd in olives, like the abode of Peace, Lay Lagartina; and the cool fresh gale Bending the young corn on the gradual slope Play'd o'er its varying verdure. I beheld A convent near, and could almost have thought The dwellers there must needs be holy men, For as they look'd around them all they saw Was good. But when the purple eve came on, How did the lovely landscape fill my heart! Trees scatter'd among peering rocks adorn'd The near ascent; the vale was overspread With ilex in its wintry foliage gay, Old cork-trees through their soft and swelling bark Bursting, and glaucous olives, underneath Whose fertilizing influence the green herb Grows greener, and with heavier ears enrich'd The healthful harvest bends. Pellucid streams Through many a vocal channel from the hills Wound through the valley their melodious way; And o'er the intermediate woods descried, Naval-Moral's church tower announced to us Our resting-place that night,—a welcome mark; Though willingly we loiter'd to behold In long expanse Plasencia's fertile plain, And the high mountain range which bounded it, Now losing fast the roseate hue that eve Shed o'er its summit and its snowy breast, For eve was closing now. Faint and more faint The murmurs of the goatherd's scattered flock Were borne upon the air, and sailing slow The broad-wing'd stork sought on the church tower top His consecrated nest. O lovely scenes! I gazed upon you with intense delight, And yet with thoughts that weigh the spirit down. I was a stranger in a foreign land, And knowing that these eyes should never more Behold that glorious prospect, Earth itself Appear'd the place of pilgrimage it is. Bristol, January 15. 1797. IX. TO MARGARET HILL. WRITTEN FROM LONDON. 1798. Margaret! my Cousin, . . nay, you must not smile I love the homely and familiar phrase: And I will call thee Cousin Margaret, However quaint amid the measured line The good old term appears. Oh! it looks ill When delicate tongues disclaim old terms of kin, Sir-ing and Madam-ing as civilly As if the road between the heart and lips Were such a weary and Laplandish way, That the poor travellers came to the red gates Half frozen. Trust me, Cousin Margaret, For many a day my memory hath play'd The creditor with me on your account, And made me shame to think that I should owe So long the debt of kindness. But in truth Like Christian on his pilgrimage, I bear So heavy a pack of business, that albeit I toil on mainly, in our twelve hours' race Time leaves me distanced. Loth indeed were I That for a moment you should lay to me Unkind neglect; mine, Margaret, is a heart That smokes not, yet methinks there should be some Who know its genuine warmth. I am not one Who can play off my smiles and courtesies To every Lady of her lap-dog tired Who wants a play-thing; I am no sworn friend Of half-an-hour, as apt to leave as love; Mine are no mushroom feelings, which spring up At once without a seed and take no root, Wiseliest distrusted. In a narrow sphere, The little circle of domestic life, I would be known and loved: the world beyond Is not for me. But, Margaret, sure I think That you should know me well, for you and I Grew up together, and when we look back Upon old times, our recollections paint The same familiar faces. Did I wield The wand of Merlin's magic, I would make Brave witchcraft. We would have a faery ship, Aye, a new Ark, as in that other flood Which swept the sons of Anak from the earth; The Sylphs should waft us to some goodly isle Like that where whilom old Apollidon, Retiring wisely from the troublous world, Built up his blameless spell; and I would bid The Sea-Nymphs pile around their coral bowers, That we might stand upon the beach, and mark The far-off breakers shower their silver spray, And hear the eternal roar, whose pleasant sound Told us that never mariner should reach Our quiet coast. In such a blessed isle We might renew the days of infancy, And Life like a long childhood pass away, Without one care. It may be, Margaret, That I shall yet be gather'd to my friends; For I am not of those who live estranged Of choice, till at the last they join their race In the family-vault. If so, if I should lose, Like my old friend the Pilgrim, this huge pack So heavy on my shoulders, I and mine Right pleasantly will end our pilgrimage. If not, if I should never get beyond This Vanity-town, there is another world Where friends will meet. And often, Margaret, I gaze at night into the boundless sky, And think that I shall there be born again, The exalted native of some better star; And, like the untaught American, I look To find in Heaven the things I loved on earth. X. AUTUMN. Nay, William, nay, not so! the changeful year In all its due successions to my sight Presents but varied beauties, transient all, All in their season good. These fading leaves, That-with their rich variety of hues Make yonder forest in the slanting sun So beautiful, in you awake the thought Of winter, . . cold, drear winter, when the trees Each like a fleshless skeleton shall stretch Its bare brown boughs; when not a flower shall spread Its colours to the day, and not a bird Carol its joyaunce, . . but all nature wear One sullen aspect, bleak and desolate, To eye, ear, feeling, comfortless alike. To me their many-colour'd beauties speak Of times of merriment and festival, The year's best holyday: I call to mind The school-boy days, when in the falling leaves I saw with eager hope the pleasant sign Of coming Christmas; when at morn I took My wooden kalendar, and counting up Once more its often-told account, smoothed off Each day with more delight the daily notch, To you the beauties of the autumnal year Make mournful emblems, and you think of man Doom'd to the grave's long winter, spirit-broken, Bending beneath the burthen of his years, Sense-dull'd and fretful, “full of aches and pains,” Yet clinging still to life. To me they shew The calm decay of nature when the mind Retains its strength, and in the languid eye Religion's holy hopes kindle a joy That makes old age look lovely. All to you Is dark and cheerless; you in this fair world See some destroying principle abroad, Air, earth, and water full of living things, Each on the other preying; and the ways Of man, a strange perplexing labyrinth, Where crimes and miseries, each producing each, Render life loathsome, and destroy the hope That should in death bring comfort. Oh, my friend, That thy faith were as mine! that thou couldst see Death still producing life, and evil still Working its own destruction; couldst behold The strifes and troubles of this troubled world With the strong eye that sees the promised day Dawn through this night of tempest! All things then Would minister to joy; then should thine heart Be heal'd and harmonized, and thou wouldst feel God, always, every where, and all in all. Westbury, 1798. XI. THE VICTORY. Hark, . . how the church-bells with redoubling peals Stun the glad ear! Tidings of joy have come, Good tidings of great joy! two gallant ships Met on the element, . . they met, they fought A desperate fight! . . good tidings of great joy! Old England triumph'd! yet another day Of glory for the ruler of the waves! For those who fell, 'twas in their country's cause, They have their passing paragraphs of praise, And are forgotten. There was one who died In that day's glory, whose obscurer name No proud historian's page will chronicle. Peace to his honest soul! I read his name, 'Twas in the list of slaughter, and thank'd God The sound was not familiar to mine ear. But it was told me after, that this man Was one whom lawful violence had forced From his own home and wife and little ones, Who by his labour lived; that he was one Whose uncorrupted heart could keenly feel A husband's love, a father's anxiousness; That from the wages of his toil he fed The distant dear ones, and would talk of them At midnight when he trod the silent deck With him he valued, . . talk of them, of joys Which he had known, . . oh God! and of the hour When they should meet again, till his full heart, His manly heart, at times would overflow, Even like a child's, with very tenderness. Peace to his honest spirit! suddenly It came, and merciful the ball of death, That it came suddenly and shatter'd him, Nor left a moment's agonizing thought On those he loved so well. He ocean-deep Now lies at rest. Be Thou her comforter Who art the widow's friend! Man does not know What a cold sickness made her blood run back When first she heard the tidings of the fight! Man does not know with what a dreadful hope She listened to the names of those who died; Man does not know, or knowing will not heed, With what an agony of tenderness She gazed upon her children, and beheld His image who was gone. O God! be Thou, Who art the widow's friend, her comforter! Westbury, 1798. XII. HISTORY. Thou chronicle of crimes! I read no more; For I am one who willingly would love His fellow-kind. O gentle Poesy, Receive me from the court's polluted scenes, From dungeon horrors, from the fields of war, Receive me to your haunts, . . that I may nurse My nature's better feelings, for my soul Sickens at man's misdeeds! I spake, when lo! There stood before me, in her majesty, Clio, the strong-eyed Muse. Upon her brow Sate a calm anger. Go, young man, she cried, Sigh among myrtle bowers, and let thy soul Effuse itself in strains so sorrowful sweet, That love-sick Maids may weep upon thy page, Soothed with delicious sorrow. Oh shame! shame! Was it for this I waken'd thy young mind? Was it for this I made thy swelling heart Throb at the deeds of Greece, and thy boy's eye So kindle when that glorious Spartan died? Boy! boy! deceive me not! . . . What if the tale Of murder'd millions strike a chilling pang; What if Tiberius in his island stews, And Philip at his beads, alike inspire Strong anger and contempt; hast thou not risen With nobler feelings, . . with a deeper love For freedom? Yes; if righteously thy soul Loathes the black history of human crimes And human misery, let that spirit fill Thy song, and it shall teach thee, boy! to raise Strains such as Cato might have deign'd to hear, As Sidney in his hall of bliss may love. Westbury, 1798. XIII. WRITTEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER READING THE SPEECH OF ROBERT EMMET, ON HIS TRIAL AND CONVICTION FOR HIGH TREASON, SEPT. 1803. “Let no man write my epitaph; let my grave Be uninscribed, and let my memory rest Till other times are come, and other men, Who then may do me justice.” These were the words in his speech: “Let there be no inscription upon my tomb. Let no man write my epitaph. No man can write my epitaph. I am here ready to die. I am not allowed to vindicate my character; and when I am prevented from vindicating myself, let no man dare to calumniate me. Let my character and my motives repose in obscurity and peace, till other times and other men can do them justice. Then shall my character be vindicated; then may my epitaph be written. I have done.” Emmet, no! No withering curse hath dried my spirit up, That I should now be silent, . . that my soul Should from the stirring inspiration shrink, Now when it shakes her, and withhold her voice, Of that divinest impulse never more Worthy, if impious I withheld it now, Hardening my heart. Here, here in this free Isle, To which in thy young virtue's erring zeal Thou wert so perilous an enemy, Here in free England shall an English hand Build thy imperishable monument; O, . . to thine own misfortune and to ours, By thine own deadly error so beguiled, Here in free England shall an English voice Raise up thy mourning-song. For thou hast paid The bitter penalty of that misdeed; Justice hath done her unrelenting part, If she in truth be Justice who drives on, Bloody and blind, the chariot wheels of death. So young, so glowing for the general good, Oh what a lovely manhood had been thine, When all the violent workings of thy youth Had pass'd away, hadst thou been wisely spared, Left to the slow and certain influences Of silent feeling and maturing thought. How had that heart, . . that noble heart of thine, Which even now had snapt one spell, which beat With such brave indignation at the shame And guilt of France, and of her miscreant Lord, How had it clung to England! With what love, What pure and perfect love, return'd to her, Now worthy of thy love, the champion now For freedom, . . yea, the only champion now, And soon to be the Avenger. But the blow Hath fallen, the indiscriminating blow, That for its portion to the Grave consign'd Youth, Genius, generous Virtue. Oh, grief, grief! Oh, sorrow and reproach! Have ye to learn, Deaf to the past, and to the future blind, Ye who thus irremissibly exact The forfeit life, how lightly life is staked, When in distempered times the feverish mind To strong delusion yields? Have ye to learn With what a deep and spirit-stirring voice Pity doth call Revenge? Have ye no hearts To feel and understand how Mercy tames The rebel nature, madden'd by old wrongs, And binds it in the gentle bands of love, When steel and adamant were weak to hold That Samson-strength subdued! Let no man write Thy epitaph! Emmet, nay; thou shalt not go Without thy funeral strain! O young and good And wise, though erring here, thou shalt not go Unhonour'd nor unsung. And better thus Beneath that indiscriminating stroke, Better to fall, than to have lived to mourn, As sure thou wouldst, in misery and remorse, Thine own disastrous triumph; to have seen, If the Almighty at that aweful hour Had turn'd away his face, wild Ignorance Let loose, and frantic Vengeance, and dark Zeal, And all bad passions tyrannous, and the fires Of Persecution once again ablaze. How had it sunk into thy soul to see, Last curse of all, the ruffian slaves of France In thy dear native country lording it! How happier thus, in that heroic mood That takes away the sting of death, to die, By all the good and all the wise forgiven, Yea, in all ages by the wise and good To be remember'd, mourn'd, and honour'd still. Keswick. XIV. THANKSGIVING FOR VICTORY. [Written for Music, and composed by Shield.] Glory to Thee in thine omnipotence, O Lord, who art our shield and our defence, And dost dispense, As seemeth best to thine unerring will (Which passeth mortal sense), The lot of Victory still; Edging sometimes with might the sword unjust; And bowing to the dust The rightful cause, that so such seeming ill May thine appointed purposes fulfil; Sometimes, as in this late auspicious hour For which our hymns we raise, Making the wicked feel thy present power; Glory to thee and praise. Almighty God, by whom our strength was given! Glory to thee, O Lord of Earth and Heaven! Keswick, 1815. XV. STANZAS WRITTEN IN LADY LONSDALE'S ALBUM, AT LOWTHER CASTLE, OCTOBER 13. 1821. 1 Sometimes in youthful years, When in some ancient ruin I have stood, Alone and musing, till with quiet tears I felt my cheeks bedew'd, A melancholy thought hath made me grieve For this our age, and humbled me in mind, That it should pass away and leave No monuments behind. 2 Not for themselves alone Our fathers lived; nor with a niggard hand Raised they the fabrics of enduring stone, Which yet adorn the land; Their piles, memorials of the mighty dead, Survive them still, majestic in decay; But ours are like ourselves, I said, The creatures of a day. 3 With other feelings now, Lowther! have I beheld thy stately walls, Thy pinnacles, and broad embattled brow, And hospitable halls. The sun those wide-spread battlements shall crest, And silent years unharming shall go by, Till centuries in their course invest Thy towers with sanctity. 4 But thou the while shalt bear, To after-times, an old and honoured name, And to remote posterity declare, Thy Founder's virtuous fame. Fair structure! worthy the triumphant age Of glorious England's opulence and power, Peace be thy lasting heritage, And happiness thy dower! XVI. STANZAS ADDRESSED TO W. R. TURNER, ESQ., R.A., ON HIS VIEW OF THE LAGO MAGGIORE FROM THE TOWN OF ARONA. [Engraved for the Keepsake of 1829.] 1 Turner, thy pencil brings to mind a day When from Laveno and the Beuscer hill I over Lake Verbanus held my way In pleasant fellowship, with wind at will; Smooth were the waters wide, the sky serene, And our hearts gladden'd with the joyful scene; 2 Joyful, . . for all things minister'd delight, . . The lake and land, the mountains and the vales; The Alps their snowy summits rear'd in light, Tempering with gelid breath the summer gales; And verdant shores and woods refresh'd the eye That else had ached beneath that brilliant sky. 3 To that elaborate island were we bound Of yore the scene of Borromean pride, . . Folly's prodigious work; where all around, Under its coronet and self-belied, Look where you will, you cannot choose but see The obtrusive motto's proud “Humility!” 4 Far off the Borromean saint was seen Distinct though distant, o'er his native town, Where his Colossus with benignant mien Looks from its station on Arona down: To it the inland sailor lifts his eyes, From the wide lake, when perilous storms arise. 5 But no storm threaten'd on that summer-day; The whole rich scene appear'd for joyance made; With many a gliding bark the mere was gay, The fields and groves in all their wealth array'd; I could have thought the Sun beheld with smiles Those towns and palaces and populous isles. 6 From fair Arona, even on such a day, When gladness was descending like a shower, Great painter, did thy gifted eye survey The splendid scene; and, conscious of its power, Well hath thine hand inimitable given The glories of the lake, and land, and heaven. Keswick, 1828. XVII. ON A PICTURE BY J. M. WRIGHT, ESQ. [Engraved for the Keepsake of 1829.] 1 The sky-lark hath perceived his prison-door Unclosed; for liberty the captive tries: Puss eagerly hath watched him from the floor, And in her grasp he flutters, pants, and dies. 2 Lucy's own Puss, and Lucy's own dear Bird, Her foster'd favourites both for many a day, That which the tender-hearted girl preferr'd, She in her fondness knew not sooth to say. 3 For if the sky-lark's pipe were shrill and strong, And its rich tones the thrilling ear might please, Yet Pussybel could breathe a fireside song As winning, when she lay on Lucy's knees. 4 Both knew her voice, and each alike would seek Her eye, her smile, her fondling touch to gain: How faintly then may words her sorrow speak, When by the one she sees the other slain. 5 The flowers fall scatter'd from her lifted hands; A cry of grief she utters in affright; And self-condemn'd for negligence she stands Aghast and helpless at the cruel sight. 6 Come, Lucy, let me dry those tearful eyes; Take thou, dear child, a lesson not unholy, From one whom nature taught to moralize Both in his mirth and in his melancholy. 7 I will not warn thee not to set thy heart Too fondly upon perishable things; In vain the earnest preacher spends his art Upon that theme; in vain the poet sings. 8 It is our nature's strong necessity, And this the soul's unerring instincts tell: Therefore I say, let us love worthily, Dear child, and then we cannot love too well. 9 Better it is all losses to deplore, Which dutiful affection can sustain, Than that the heart should, in its inmost core, Harden without it, and have lived in vain. 10 This love which thou hast lavish'd, and the woe Which makes thy lip now quiver with distress, Are but a vent, an innocent overflow, From the deep springs of female tenderness. 11 And something I would teach thee from the grief That thus hath fill'd those gentle eyes with tears, The which may be thy sober, sure relief When sorrow visits thee in after years. 12 I ask not whither is the spirit flown That lit the eye which there in death is seal'd; Our Father hath not made that mystery known; Needless the knowledge, therefore not reveal'd. 13 But didst thou know in sure and sacred truth, It had a place assign'd in yonder skies, There through an endless life of joyous youth, To warble in the bowers of Paradise; 14 Lucy, if then the power to thee were given In that cold form its life to re-engage, Wouldst thou call back the warbler from its Heaven To be again the tenant of a cage? 15 Only that thou might'st cherish it again, Wouldst thou the object of thy love recall To mortal life, and chance, and change, and pain, And death, which must be suffered once by all? 16 Oh, no, thou say'st: oh, surely not, not so! I read the answer which those looks express For pure and true affection well I know Leaves in the heart no room for selfishness. 17 Such love of all our virtues is the gem; We bring with us the immortal seed at birth: Of heaven it is, and heavenly; woe to them Who make it wholly earthly and of earth! 18 What we love perfectly, for its own sake We love and not our own, being ready thus Whate'er self-sacrifice is ask'd, to make; That which is best for it, is best for us. 19 O Lucy! treasure up that pious thought! It hath a balm for sorrow's deadliest darts; And with true comfort thou wilt find it fraught, If grief should reach thee in thy heart of hearts Buckland, 1828. XVIII. 1 My days among the Dead are past; Around me I behold, Where'er these casual eyes are cast, The mighty minds of old; My never failing friends are they, With whom I converse day by day. 2 With them I take delight in weal, And seek relief in woe; And while I understand and feel How much to them I owe, My cheeks have often been bedew'd With tears of thoughtful gratitude. 3 My thoughts are with the Dead, with them I live in long-past years, Their virtues love, their faults condemn, Partake their hopes and fears, And from their lessons seek and find Instruction with an humble mind. 4 My hopes are with the Dead, anon My place with them will be, And I with them shall travel on Through all Futuritv: Yet leaving here a name, I trust, That will not perish in the dust. Keswick, 1818. XIX. IMITATED FROM THE PERSIAN. Lord! who art merciful as well as just, Incline thine ear to me, a child of dust! Not what I would, O Lord! I offer thee, Alas! but what I can. Father Almighty, who hast made me man, And bade me look to Heaven, for Thou art there, Accept my sacrifice and humble prayer. Four things which are not in thy treasury, I lay before thee, Lord, with this petition: . . My nothingness, my wants, My sins, and my contrition. Lowther Castle, 1828. THE RETROSPECT. On as I journey through the vale of years, By hopes enliven'd, or deprest by fears, Allow me, Memory, in thy treasured store, To view the days that will return no more. And yes! before thine intellectual ray, The clouds of mental darkness melt away! As when, at earliest day's awakening dawn, The hovering mists obscure the dewy lawn, O'er all the landscape spread their influence chill, Hang o'er the vale and wood, and hide the hill, Anon, slow-rising, comes the orb of day, Slow fade the shadowy mists and roll away, The prospect opens on the traveller's sight, And hills and vales and woods reflect the living light. O thou, the mistress of my future days, Accept thy minstrel's retrospective lays; To whom the minstrel and the lyre belong, Accept, my Edith, Memory's pensive song. Of long-past days I sing, ere yet I knew Or thought and grief, or happiness and you; Ere yet my infant heart had learnt to prove The cares of life, the hopes and fears of love. Corston, twelve years in various fortunes fled Have past with restless progress o'er my head, Since in thy vale beneath the master's rule I dwelt an inmate of the village school. Yet still will Memory's busy eye retrace Each little vestige of the well-known place; Each wonted haunt and scene of youthful joy, Where merriment has cheer'd the careless boy; Well-pleased will fancy still the spot survey Where once he triumph'd in the boyish play, Without one care where every morn he rose, Where every evening sunk to calm repose. Large was the house, though fallen in course of fate From its old grandeur and manorial state. Lord of the manor, here the jovial Squire Once call'd his tenants round the crackling fire; Here while the glow of joy suffused his face, He told his ancient exploits in the chase, And, proud his rival sportsmen to surpass, He lit again the pipe, and fill'd again the glass. But now no more was heard at early morn The echoing clangor of the huntsman's horn; No more the eager hounds with deepening cry Leapt round him as they knew their pastime nigh; The Squire no more obey'd the morning call, Nor favourite spaniels fill'd the sportsman's hall; For he, the last descendant of his race, Slept with his fathers, and forgot the chase. There now in petty empire o'er the school The mighty master held despotic rule; Trembling in silence all his deeds we saw, His look a mandate, and his word a law; Severe his voice, severe and stern his mien, And wondrous strict he was, and wondrous wise I ween. Even now through many a long long year I trace The hour when first with awe I view'd his face; Even now recall my entrance at the dome, . . 'Twas the first day I ever left my home! Years intervening have not worn away The deep remembrance of that wretched day, Nor taught me to forget my earliest fears, A mother's fondness, and a mother's tears; When close she prest me to her sorrowing heart, As loth as even I myself to part; And I, as I beheld her sorrows flow, With painful effort hid my inward woe. But time to youthful troubles brings relief, And each new object weans the child from grief. Like April showers the tears of youth descend, Sudden they fall, and suddenly they end, And fresher pleasure cheers the following hour, As brighter shines the sun after the April shower. Methinks even now the interview I see, The Mistress's glad smile, the Master's glee; Much of my future happiness they said, Much of the easy life the scholars led, Of spacious play-ground and of wholesome air The best instruction and the tenderest care; And when I followed to the garden-door My father, till through tears I saw no more, . . How civilly they soothed my parting pain, And never did they speak so civilly again. Why loves the soul on earlier years to dwell, When Memory spreads around her saddening spell, When discontent, with sullen gloom o'ercast, Turns from the present and prefers the past? Why calls reflection to my pensive view Each trifling act of infancy anew, Each trifling act with pleasure pondering o'er, Even at the time when trifles please no more? Yet is remembrance sweet, though well I know The days of childhood are but days of woe; Some rude restraint, some petty tyrant sours What else should be our sweetest, blithest hours; Yet is it sweet to call those hours to mind, . . Those easy hours for ever left behind; Ere care began the spirit to oppress, When ignorance itself was happiness. Such was my state in those remember'd years When two small acres bounded all my fears; And therefore still with pleasure I recall The tapestried school, the bright brown-boarded hall, The murmuring brook, that every morning saw The due observance of the cleanly law; The walnuts, where, when favour would allow, Full oft I wont to search each well-stript bough; The crab-tree, which supplied a secret hoard With roasted crabs to deck the wintry board; These trifling objects then my heart possest, These trifling objects still remain imprest; So when with unskill'd hand some idle hind Carves his rude name within a sapling's rind, In after years the peasant lives to see The expanding letters grow as grows the tree; Though every winter's desolating sway Shake the hoarse grove and sweep the leaves away, That rude inscription uneffaced will last, Unalter'd by the storm or wintry blast. Oh while well pleased the letter'd traveller roams Among old temples, palaces, and domes, Strays with the Arab o'er the wreck of time Where erst Palmyra's towers arose sublime, Or marks the lazy Turk's lethargic pride, And Grecian slavery on Ilyssus' side, Oh be it mine, aloof from public strife, To mark the changes of domestic life, The alter'd scenes where once I bore a part, Where every change of fortune strikes the heart. As when the merry bells with echoing sound Proclaim the news of victory around, Rejoicing patriots run the news to spread Of glorious conquest and of thousands dead, All join the loud huzza with eager breath, And triumph in the tale of blood and death; But if extended on the battle-plain, Cut off in conquest some dear friend be slain, Affection then will fill the sorrowing eye, And suffering Nature grieve that one should die. Cold was the morn, and bleak the wintry blast Blew o'er the meadow, when I saw thee last. My bosom bounded as I wandered round With silent step the long-remember'd ground, Where I had loiter'd out so many an hour, Chased the gay butterfly, and cull'd the flower, Sought the swift arrow's erring course to trace, Or with mine equals vied amid the chase. I saw the church where I had slept away The tedious service of the summer day; Or, hearing sadly all the preacher told, In winter waked and shiver'd with the cold. Oft have my footsteps roam'd the sacred ground Where heroes, kings, and poets sleep around; Oft traced the mouldering castle's ivied wall, Or aged convent tottering to its fall; Yet never had my bosom felt such pain, As, Corston, when I saw thy scenes again; For many a long-lost pleasure came to view, For many a long-past sorrow rose anew; Where whilom all were friends I stood alone, Unknowing all I saw, of all I saw unknown. There, where my little hands were wont to rear With pride the earliest salad of the year; Where never idle weed to spring was seen, Rank thorns and nettles rear'd their heads obscene. Still all around and sad, I saw no more The playful group, nor heard the playful roar; There echoed round no shout of mirth and glee, It seem'd as though the world were changed like me! Enough! it boots not on the past to dwell, . . Fair scene of other years, a long farewell! Rouse up, my soul! it boots not to repine, Rouse up! for worthier feelings should be thine; Thy path is plain and straight, . . that light is given, . . Onward in faith, . . and leave the rest to Heaven. Oxford, 1794. HYMN TO THE PENATES. Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me. The words of Agur. ????? ???????? ?????, ???? ???????? ?? ??????. Hesiod. Yet one Song more! one high and solemn strain Ere, Phœbus! on thy temple's ruin'd wall I hang the silent harp: there may its strings, When the rude tempest shakes the aged pile, Make melancholy music. One song more! Penates, hear me! for to you I hymn The votive lay; whether, as sages deem, Ye dwell in inmost Hence one explanation of the name Penates, because they were supposed to reign in the inmost heavens. Heaven, the Counsellors This was the belief of the ancient Hetrusci, who called them Concertes and Complices. Of Jove; or if, Supreme of Deities, All things are yours, and in your holy train Jove proudly ranks, and Juno, white-arm'd Queen, And wisest of Immortals, the dread Maid Athenian Pallas. Venerable Powers, Hearken your hymn of praise! Though from your rites Estranged, and exiled from your altars long, I have not ceased to love you, Household Gods! In many a long and melancholy hour Of solitude and sorrow, hath my heart With earnest longings pray'd to rest at length Beside your hallow'd hearth, . . for Peace is there! Yes, I have loved you long! I call on ye Yourselves to witness with what holy joy, Shunning the common herd of humankind, I have retired to watch your lonely fires And commune with myself: . . delightful hours, That gave mysterious pleasure, made me know Mine inmost heart, its weakness and its strength, Taught me to cherish with devoutest care Its deep unworldly feelings, taught me too The best of lessons—to respect myself. Nor have I ever ceased to reverence you, Domestic Deities! from the first dawn Of reason, through the adventurous paths of youth, Even to this better day, when on mine ear The uproar of contending nations sounds But like the passing wind, and wakes no pulse To tumult. When a child... (for still I love To dwell with fondness on my childish years,) When first, a little one, I left my home, I can remember the first grief I felt, And the first painful smile that clothed my front With feelings not its own: sadly at night I sat me down beside a stranger's hearth; And when the lingering hour of rest was come, First wet with tears my pillow. As I grew In years and knowledge, and the course of time Developed the young feelings of my heart, When most I loved in solitude to rove Amid the woodland gloom; or where the rocks Darken'd old Avon's stream, in the ivied cave Recluse to sit and brood the future song, . . Yet not the less, Penates, loved I then Your altars; not the less at evening hour Loved I beside the well-trimm'd fire to sit, Absorb'd in many a dear deceitful dream Of visionary joys, . . deceitful dreams, . . And yet not vain; for painting purest bliss, They form'd to Fancy's mould her votary's heart. By Cherwell's sedgey side, and in the meads Where Isis in her calm clear stream reflects The willow's bending boughs, at early dawn, In the noon-tide hour, and when the night-mist rose, I have remember'd you; and when the noise Of lewd Intemperance on my lonely ear Burst with loud tumult, as recluse I sate, Musing on days when man should be redeem'd From servitude, and vice, and wretchedness, I blest you, Household Gods! because I loved Your peaceful altars and serener rites. Nor did I cease to reverence you, when driven Amid the jarring crowd, an unfit man To mingle with the world; still, still my heart Sigh'd for your sanctuary, and inly pined; And loathing human converse, I have stray'd Where o'er the sea-beach chilly howl'd the blast, And gazed upon the world of waves, and wish'd That I were far beyond the Atlantic deep, In woodland haunts, a sojourner with Peace. Not idly did the ancient poets dream, Who peopled earth with Deities. They trod The wood with reverence where the Dryads dwelt; At day's dim dawn or evening's misty hour They saw the Oreads on their mountain haunts, And felt their holy influence; nor impure Of thought, nor ever with polluted hands, ???? ???? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ???? ????? ?????, ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ???? ??????, ?????? ????????? ????????? ????? ?????, ?? ??????? ?????, ???????? ?? ?????? ??????? ???? ???? ????????, ??? ????? ????? ??????.Hesiod. Whene'er thy feet the river ford essay, Whose flowing current winds its limpid way, Thy hands amid the pleasant waters lave; And lowly gazing on the beauteous wave, Appease the River God: if thou perverse Pass with unsprinkled hands, a heavy curse Shall rest upon thee from the observant skies, And after-woes retributive arise. Elton. Touch'd they without a prayer the Naiad's spring Nor without reverence to the River God Cross'd in unhappy hour his limpid stream. Yet was this influence transient; such brief aw Inspiring as the thunder's long loud peal Strikes to the feeble spirit. Household Gods, Not such your empire! in your votaries' breasts No momentary impulse ye awake; Nor fleeting, like their local energies, The deep devotion that your fanes impart. O ye whom Youth has wilder'd on your way, Or Pleasure with her syren song hath lured, Or Fame with spirit-stirring trump hath call'd To climb her summits, . . to your Household Gods Return; for not in Pleasure's gay abodes, Nor in the unquiet unsafe halls of Fame Doth Happiness abide. O ye who grieve Much for the miseries of your fellow-kind, More for their vices; ye whose honest eyes Scowl on Oppression,—ye whose honest hearts Beat high when Freedom sounds her dread alarm; O ye who quit the path of peaceful life Crusading for mankind.. a spaniel race That lick the hand that beats them, or tear all Alike in frenzy; to your Household Gods Return! for by their altars Virtue dwells, And Happiness with her; for by their fires Tranquillity, in no unsocial mood, Sits silent, listening to the pattering shower; For, so Suspicion Oft though Wisdom wake, Suspicion sleeps At Wisdom's gate, and to Simplicity Resigns her charge, while Goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems.Milton sleep not at the gate Of Wisdom, Falsehood shall not enter there. As on the height of some huge eminence, Reach'd with long labour, the way-faring man Pauses awhile, and gazing o'er the plain With many a sore step travell'd, turns him then Serious to contemplate the onward road, And calls to mind the comforts of his home, And sighs that he has left them, and resolves To stray no more: I on my way of life Muse thus, Penates, and with firmest faith Devote myself to you. I will not quit, To mingle with the crowd, your calm abodes, Where by the evening hearth Contentment sits And hears the cricket chirp; where Love delights To dwell, and on your altars lays his torch That burns with no extinguishable flame. Hear me, ye Powers benignant! there is one Must be mine inmate, . . for I may not choose But love him. He is one whom many wrongs Have sicken'd of the world. There was a time When he would weep to hear of wickedness, And wonder at the tale; when for the opprest He felt a brother's pity, to the oppressor A good man's honest anger. His quick eye Betray'd each rising feeling; every thought Leapt to his tongue. When first among mankind He mingled, by himself he judged of them, And loved and trusted them, to Wisdom deaf, And took them to his bosom. Falsehood met Her unsuspecting victim, fair of front, And lovely as Apega's One of the ways and means of the tyrant Nabis. If one of his subjects refused to lend him money, he commanded him to embrace his Apega; the statue of a beautiful Woman so formed as to clasp the victim to her breast, in which a pointed Dagger was concealed. sculptured form, Like that false image caught his warm embrace, And pierced his open breast. The reptile race Clung round his bosom, and with viper folds Encircling, stung the fool who foster'd them. His mother was Simplicity, his sire Benevolence; in earlier days he bore His father's name; the world who injured him Call him Misanthropy. I may not choose But love him, Household Gods! for we grew up Together, and in the same school were bred, And our poor fortunes the same course have held, Up to this hour. Penates! some there are Who say, that not in the inmost heaven ye dwell, Gazing with eye remote on all the ways Of man, his Guardian Gods; wiselier they deem A dearer interest to the human race Links you, yourselves the Spirits of the Dead. No mortal eye may pierce the invisible world, No light of human reason penetrate The depths where Truth lies hid. Yet to this faith My heart with instant sympathy assents; And I would judge all systems and all faiths By that best touchstone, from whose test Deceit Shrinks like the Arch-Fiend at Ithuriel's spear; And Sophistry's gay glittering bubble bursts, As at the spousals of the Nereid's son, When that false Florimel Then did he set her by that snowy one, Like the true saint beside the image set, Of both their beauties to make paragone And trial whether should the honour get; Streightway so soone as both together met, The enchaunted damsell vanish'd into nought; Her snowy substance melted as with heat; Ne of that goodly hew remayned ought But the empty girdle which about her wast was wrought. Spenser., with her prototype Set side by side, in her unreal charms, Dissolved away. Nor can the halls of Heaven Give to the human soul such kindred joy, As hovering o'er its earthly haunts it feels, When with the breeze it dwells around the brow Of one beloved on earth; or when at night In dreams it comes, and brings with it the Days And Joys that are no more. Or when, perchance With power permitted to alleviate ill And fit the sufferer for the coming woe, Some strange presage the Spirit breathes, and fills The breast with ominous fear, preparing it For sorrow, pours into the afflicted heart The balm of resignation, and inspires With heavenly hope. Even as a child delights To visit day by day the favourite plant His hand has sown, to mark its gradual growth, And watch all-anxious for the promised flower; Thus to the blessed spirit in innocence And pure affections like a little child, Sweet will it be to hover o'er the friends Beloved; then sweetest, if, as duty prompts, With earthly care we in their breasts have sown The seeds of Truth and Virtue, holy flowers Whose odour reacheth Heaven. When my sick Heart (Sick Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. Proverbs. Quâ non gravior mortalibus addita cura, Spes ubi longa venit. Statius. with hope long delay'd, than which no care Weighs on the spirit heavier,) from itself Seeks the best comfort, often have I deem'd That thou didst witness every inmost thought, Seward! my dear, dead friend! For not in vain, O early summon'd on thy heavenly course, Was thy brief sojourn here; me didst thou leave With strengthen'd step to follow the right path, Till we shall meet again. Meantime I soothe The deep regret of nature, with belief, O Edmund! that thine eye's celestial ken Pervades me now, marking with no mean joy The movements of the heart that loved thee well! Such feelings Nature prompts, and hence your rites, Domestic Gods! arose. When for his son With ceaseless grief Syrophanes bewail'd, Mourning his age left childless, and his wealth Heapt for an alien, he with obstinate eye Still on the imaged marble of the dead Dwelt, pampering sorrow. Thither from his wrath, A safe asylum, fled the offending slave, And garlanded the statue, and implored His young lost lord to save. Remembrance then Soften'd the father, and he loved to see The votive wreath renew'd, and the rich smoke Curl from the costly censer slow and sweet. From Egypt soon the sorrow-soothing rites Divulging spread; before your idol forms It is not certainly known under what form the Penates were worshipped; according to some, as wooden or brazen rods shaped like trumpets; according to others, they were represented as young men. By every hearth the blinded Pagan knelt, Pouring his prayers to these, and offering there Vain sacrifice or impious, and sometimes With human blood your sanctuary defiled. Till the first Brutus, tyrant-conquering chief, Arose; he first the impious rites put down, He fitliest, who for Freedom lived and died, The friend of humankind. Then did your feasts Frequent recur and blameless; and when came The solemn festival The Saturnalia., whose happiest rites Emblem'd Equality, the holiest truth, Crown'd with gay garlands were your statues seen, To you the fragrant censer smoked, to you The rich libation flowed: vain sacrifice! For not the poppy wreath nor fruits nor wine Ye ask, Penates! nor the altar cleansed With many a mystic form; ye ask the heart Made pure, and by domestic Peace and Love Hallow'd to you. Hearken your hymn of praise, Penates! to your shrines I come for rest, There only to be found. Often at eve, As in my wanderings I have seen far off Some lonely light that spake of comfort there, It told my heart of many a joy of home, When I was homeless. Often as I gazed From some high eminence on goodly vales And cots and villages embower'd below, The thought would rise that all to me was strange Amid the scene so fair, nor one small spot Where my tired mind might rest, and call it Home. There is a magic in that little word: It is a mystic circle that surrounds Comforts and virtues never known beyond The hallowed limit. Often has my heart Ached for that quiet haven! Haven'd now, I think of those in this world's wilderness Who wander on and find no home of rest Till to the grave they go: them Poverty, Hollow-eyed fiend, the child of Wealth and Power, Bad offspring of worse parents, aye afflicts, Cankering with her foul mildews the chill'd heart; . . Them Want with scorpion scourge drives to the den Of Guilt; . . them Slaughter for the price of death Throws to her raven brood. Oh, not on them, God of eternal Justice! not on them Let fall thy thunder! Household Deities! Then only shall be Happiness on earth When man shall feel your sacred power, and love Your tranquil joys; then shall the city stand A huge void sepulchre, and on the site Where fortresses and palaces have stood, The olive grow, there shall the Tree of Peace Strike its roots deep and flourish. This the state Shall bless the race redeem'd of Man, when Wealth And Power and all their hideous progeny Shall sink annihilate, and all mankind Live in the equal brotherhood of love. Heart-calming hope, and sure! for hitherward Tend all the tumults of the troubled world, Its woes, its wisdom, and its wickedness Alike; . . so He hath will'd, whose will is just. Meantime, all hoping and expecting all In patient faith, to you, Domestic Gods! Studious of other lore than song, I come. Yet shall my Heart remember the past years With honest pride, trusting that not in vain Lives the pure song of Liberty and Truth. Bristol, 1796. END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO EDITH SOUTHEY. With way-worn feet, a traveller woe-begone, Life's upward road I journey'd many a day, And framing many a sad yet soothing lay, Beguiled the solitary hours with song. Lonely my heart and rugged was the way, Yet often pluck'd I, as I past along, The wild and simple flowers of poesy; And sometimes, unreflecting as a child, Entwined the weeds which pleased a random eye. Take thou the wreath, Beloved! it is wild And rudely garlanded; yet scorn not thou The humble offering, where dark rosemary weaves Amid gay flowers its melancholy leaves, And myrtle gathered to adorn thy brow. Bristol, 1796.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. JUVENILE AND MINOR POEMS. VOL. II. Que fol ou que sage on m'estime, Et que je sois Poete ou non, Toutefois si j'aime la rime, J'aime beaucoup mieux la raison. Jean du Nesme. ENGLISH ECLOGUES. The following Eclogues, I believe, bear no resemblance to any poems in our language. This species of composition has become popular in Germany, and I was induced to attempt it by what was told me of the German Idylls by my friend Mr. William Taylor of Norwich. So far, therefore, these pieces may be deemed imitations, though I am not acquainted with the German language at present, and have never seen any translations or specimens in this kind. With bad Eclogues I am sufficiently acquainted, from Tityrus and Corydon down to our English Strephons and Thirsisses. No kind of poetry can boast of more illustrious names, or is more distinguished by the servile dulness of imitated nonsense. Pastoral writers, “more silly than their sheep,” have, like their sheep, gone on in the same track one after another. Gay struck into a new path. His eclogues were the only ones which interested me when I was a boy, and did not know they were burlesque. The subject would furnish matter for an essay, but this is not the place for it. 1799. I. THE OLD MANSION-HOUSE. STRANGER. Old friend! why you seem bent on parish duty, Breaking the highway stones, . . and 'tis a task Somewhat too hard methinks for age like yours! OLD MAN. Why yes! for one with such a weight of years Upon his back! . . I've lived here, man and boy, In this same parish, well nigh the full age Of man, being hard upon threescore and ten. I can remember sixty years ago The beautifying of this mansion here, When my late Lady's father, the old Squire, Came to the estate. STRANGER. Why then you have outlasted All his improvements, for you see they're making Great alterations here. OLD MAN. Aye.. great indeed! And if my poor old Lady could rise up.. God rest her soul! 'twould grieve her to behold What wicked work is here. STRANGER. They've set about it In right good earnest. All the front is gone; Here's to be turf, they tell me, and a road Round to the door. There were some yew trees too Stood in the court... OLD MAN. Aye, Master! fine old trees! Lord bless us! I have heard my father say His grandfather could just remember back When they were planted there. It was my task To keep them trimm'd, and 'twas a pleasure to me; All straight and smooth, and like a great green wall! My poor old lady many a time would come And tell me where to clip, for she had play'd In childhood under them, and 'twas her pride To keep them in their beauty. Plague, I say, On their new-fangled whimsies! we shall have A modern shrubbery here stuck full of firs And your pert poplar trees; . . . I could as soon Have plough'd my father's grave as cut them down! STRANGER. But 'twill be lighter and more chearful now; A fine smooth turf, and with a carriage road That sweeps conveniently from gate to gate. I like a shrubbery too, for it looks fresh; And then there's some variety about it. In spring the lilac and the snow-ball flower, And the laburnum with its golden strings Waving in the wind: And when the autumn comes The bright red berries of the mountain-ash, With pines enough in winter to look green, And show that something lives. Sure this is better Than a great hedge of yew, making it look All the year round like winter, and for ever Dropping its poisonous leaves from the under boughs Wither'd and bare. OLD MAN. Aye! so the new Squire thinks; And pretty work he makes of it! What 'tis To have a stranger come to an old house! STRANGER. It seems you know him not? OLD MAN. No, Sir, not I. They tell me he's expected daily now; But in my Lady's time he never came But once, for they were very distant kin. If he had play'd about here when a child In that fore court, and eat the yew-berries, And sate in the porch, threading the jessamine flowers Which fell so thick, he had not had the heart To mar all thus! STRANGER. Come.! come! all is not wrong; Those old dark windows... OLD MAN. They're demolish'd too, . . As if he could not see through casement glass! The very red-breasts, that so regular Came to my Lady for her morning crumbs, Wo'n't know the windows now! STRANGER. Nay they were small, And then so darken'd round with jessamine, Harbouring the vermin; . . yet I could have wish'd That jessamine had been saved, which canopied And bower'd and lined the porch. OLD MAN. It did one good To pass within ten yards when 'twas in blossom. There was a sweet-briar too that grew beside; My Lady loved at evening to sit there And knit; and her old dog lay at her feet And slept in the sun; 'twas an old favourite dog, . . She did not love him less that he was old And feeble, and he always had a place By the fire-side: and when he died at last She made me dig a grave in the garden for him. For she was good to all! a woeful day 'Twas for the poor when to her grave she went! STRANGER. They lost a friend then? OLD MAN. You're a stranger here, Or you wouldn't ask that question. Were they sick? She had rare cordial waters, and for herbs She could have taught the Doctors. Then at winter, When weekly she distributed the bread In the poor old porch, to see her and to hear The blessings on her! and I warrant them They were a blessing to her when her wealth Had been no comfort else. At Christmas, Sir! It would have warm'd your heart if you had seen Her Christmas kitchen, . . how the blazing fire Made her fine pewter shine, and holly boughs So chearful red, . . . and as for misseltoe, . . The finest bush that grew in the country round Was mark'd for Madam. Then her old ale went So bountiful about! a Christmas cask, And 'twas a noble one! . . . God help me, Sir! But I shall never see such days again. STRANGER. Things may be better yet than you suppose, And you should hope the best. OLD MAN. It don't look well, . . These alterations, Sir! I'm an old man, And love the good old fashions; we don't find Old bounty in new houses. They've destroy'd All that my Lady loved; her favourite walk Grubb'd up, . . and they do say that the great row Of elms behind the house, which meet a-top, They must fall too. Well! well! I did not think To live to see all this, and 'tis perhaps A comfort I shan't live to see it long. STRANGER. But sure all changes are not needs for the worse, My friend? OLD MAN. May-hap they mayn't, Sir; . . for all that I like what I've been used to. I remember All this from a child up, and now to lose it, 'Tis losing an old friend. There's nothing left As 'twas; . . I go abroad and only meet With men whose fathers I remember boys; The brook that used to run before my door, That's gone to the great pond; the trees I learnt To climb are down; and I see nothing now That tells me of old times, . . except the stones In the churchyard. You are young, Sir, and I hope Have many years in store, . . . but pray to God You mayn't be left the last of all your friends. STRANGER. Well! well! you've one friend more than you're aware of. If the Squire's taste don't suit with yours, I warrant That's all you'll quarrel with: walk in and taste His beer, old friend! and see if your old Lady E'er broach'd a better cask. You did not know me, But we're acquainted now. 'Twould not be easy To make you like the outside; but within, That is not changed, my friend! you'll always find The same old bounty and old welcome there. Westbury, 1798. II. THE GRANDMOTHER'S TALE. JANE. Harry! I m tired of playing. We'll draw round The fire, and Grandmamma perhaps will tell us One of her stories. HARRY. Aye.. dear Grandmamma! A pretty story! something dismal now; A bloody murder. JANE. Or about a ghost. GRANDMOTHER. Nay, nay, I should but frighten ye. You know The other night when I was telling ye About the light in the churchyard, how you trembled Because the screech-owl hooted at the window, And would not go to bed. JANE. Why, Grandmamma, You said yourself you did not like to hear him. Pray now! . . we wo'n't be frightened. GRANDMOTHER. Well, well, children! But you've heard all my stories... Let me see, . . . Did I never tell you how the smuggler murder'd The woman down at Pill? HARRY. No.. never! never! GRANDMOTHER. Not how he cut her head off in the stable? HARRY. Oh... now! . . . do tell us that! GRANDMOTHER. You must have heard Your mother, children! often tell of her. She used to weed in the garden here, and worm Your uncle's dogs I know not whether this cruel and stupid custom is common in other parts of England. It is supposed to prevent the dogs from doing any mischief, should they afterwards become mad., and serve the house with coal; And glad enough she was in winter time To drive her asses here! It was cold work To follow the slow beasts through sleet and snow; And here she found a comfortable meal And a brave fire to thaw her, for poor Moll Was always welcome. HARRY. Oh! 'twas blear-eyed Moll The collier woman, . . a great ugly woman; I've heard of her. GRANDMOTHER. Ugly enough, poor soul! At ten yards' distance you could hardly tell If it were man or woman, for her voice Was rough as our old mastiff's, and she wore A man's old coat and hat: . . and then her face! There was a merry story told of her, How when the press-gang came to take her husband As they were both in bed, she heard them coming, Drest John up in her night-cap, and herself Put on his clothes and went before the captain. JANE. And so they prest a woman! GRANDMOTHER. 'Twas a trick She dearly loved to tell; and all the country Soon knew the jest, for she was used to travel For miles around. All weathers and all hours She cross'd the hill, as hardy as her beasts, Bearing the wind and rain and drifting snow. And if she did not reach her home at night, She laid her down in the stable with her asses, And slept as sound as they did. HARRY. With her asses! GRANDMOTHER. Yes; and she loved her beasts. For though, poor wretch, She was a terrible reprobate, and swore Like any trooper, she was always good To the dumb creatures; never loaded them Beyond their strength; and rather, I believe, Would stint herself than let the poor beasts want, Because, she said, they could not ask for food. I never saw her stick fall heavier on them Than just with its own weight. She little thought This tender-heartedness would cause her death! There was a fellow who had oftentimes, As if he took delight in cruelty, Ill-used her beasts. He was a man who lived By smuggling, and, . . for she had often met him, Crossing the down at night, . . she threaten'd him, If ever he abused them more, to inform Of his unlawful ways. Well.. so it was.. 'Twas what they both were born to! he provoked her: She laid an information; and one morning They found her in the stable, her throat cut From ear to ear, till the head only hung Just by a bit of skin. JANE. Oh dear! oh dear! HARRY. I hope they hung the man! GRANDMOTHER. They took him up; There was no proof, no one had seen the deed, And he was set at liberty. But God, Whose eye beholdeth all things, He had seen The murder; and the murderer knew that God Was witness to his crime. He fled the place, . . But nowhere could he fly the avenging hand Of Heaven, . . but nowhere could the murderer rest; . . A guilty conscience haunted him; by day, By night, in company, in solitude, Restless and wretched, did he bear upon him The weight of blood. Her cries were in his ears; Her stifled groans, as when he knelt upon her, Always he heard; always he saw her stand Before his eyes; even in the dead of night Distinctly seen as though in the broad sun, She stood beside the murderer's bed, and yawn'd Her ghastly wound; till life itself became A punishment at last he could not bear, And he confess'd it all, and gave himself To death; so terrible, he said, it was To have a guilty conscience! HARRY. Was he hung, then? GRANDMOTHER. Hung and anatomized. Poor wretched man, Your uncles went to see him on his trial; He was so pale, so thin, so hollow-eyed, And such a horror in his meagre face, They said he look'd like one who never slept. He begg'd the prayers of all who saw his end, And met his death with fears that well might warn From guilt, though not without a hope in Christ. Westbury, 1798. III. HANNAH. Passing across a green and lonely lane A funeral met our view. It was not here A sight of every day, as in the streets Of some great city, and we stopt and ask'd Whom they were bearing to the grave. A girl, They answer'd, of the village, who had pined Through the long course of eighteen painful months With such slow wasting, that the hour of death Came welcome to her We pursued our way To the house of mirth, and with that idle talk Which passes o'er the mind and is forgot, We wore away the time. But it was eve When homewardly I went, and in the air Was that cool freshness, that discolouring shade Which makes the eye turn inward: hearing then Over the vale the heavy toll of death Sound slow, it made me think upon the dead; I question'd more, and learnt her mournful tale. She bore unhusbanded a mother's pains, And he who should have cherish'd her, far off Sail'd on the seas. Left thus, a wretched one, Scorn made a mock of her, and evil tongues Were busy with her name. She had to bear The sharper sorrow of neglect from him Whom she had loved too dearly. Once he wrote But only once that drop of comfort came To mingle with her cup of wretchedness; And when his parents had some tidings from him, There was no mention of poor Hannah there, Or 'twas the cold enquiry, more unkind Than silence. So she pined and pined away, And for herself and baby toil'd and toil'd; Nor did she, even on her death-bed, rest From labour, knitting there with lifted arms, Till she sunk with very weakness. Her old mother Omitted no kind office, working for her, Albeit her hardest labour barely earn'd Enough to keep life struggling, and prolong The pains of grief and sickness. Thus she lay On the sick bed of poverty, worn out With her long suffering and those painful thoughts Which at her heart were rankling, and so weak, That she could make no effort to express Affection for her infant; and the child, Whose lisping love perhaps had solaced her, Shunn'd her as one indifferent. But she too Had grown indifferent to all things of earth, Finding her only comfort in the thought Of that cold bed wherein the wretched rest. There had she now, in that last home, been laid, And all was over now, . . sickness and grief, Her shame, her suffering, and her penitence, . . Their work was done. The school-boys as they sport In the churchyard, for awhile might turn away From the fresh grave till grass should cover it; Nature would do that office soon; and none Who trod upon the senseless turf would think Of what a world of woes lay buried there! Burton, near Christ Church, 1797. IV THE SAILOR'S MOTHER. WOMAN. Sir, for the love of God, some small relief To a poor woman! TRAVELLER. Whither are you bound? 'Tis a late hour to travel o'er these downs, No house for miles around us, and the way Dreary and wild. The evening wind already Makes one's teeth chatter; and the very Sun, Setting so pale behind those thin white clouds, Looks cold. 'Twill be a bitter night! WOMAN. Aye, Sir, 'Tis cutting keen! I smart at every breath; Heaven knows how I shall reach my journey's end, For the way is long before me, and my feet, God help me! sore with travelling. I would gladly, If it pleased God, at once lie down and die. TRAVELLER. Nay, nay, cheer up! a little food and rest Will comfort you; and then your journey's end May make amends for all. You shake your head, And weep. Is it some mournful business then That leads you from your home? WOMAN. Sir, I am going To see my son at Plymouth, sadly hurt In the late action, and in the hospital Dying, I fear me, now. TRAVELLER. Perhaps your fears Make evil worse. Even if a limb be lost, There may be still enough for comfort left; An arm or leg shot off, there's yet the heart To keep life warm, and he may live to talk With pleasure of the glorious fight that maim'd him, Proud of his loss. Old England's gratitude Makes the maim'd Sailor happy. WOMAN. 'Tis not that, . . An arm or leg... I could have borne with that. It was no ball, Sir, but some cursed thing Which bursts The stink-pots used on board the French ships. In the engagement between the Mars and L'Hercule, some of our sailors were shockingly mangled by them: one, in particular as described in the Eclogue, lost both his eyes It would be right and humane to employ means of destruction, could they be discovered, powerful enough to destroy fleets and armies; but to use any thing that only inflicts additional torture upon the sufferers in war, is altogether wicked. and burns that hurt him. Something, Sir, They do not use on board our English ships, It is so wicked! TRAVELLER. Rascals! a mean art Of cruel cowardice, yet all in vain! WOMAN. Yes, Sir! and they should show no mercy to them For making use of such unchristian arms. I had a letter from the hospital, He got some friend to write it, and he tells me That my poor boy has lost his precious eyes, Burnt out. Alas! that I should ever live To see this wretched day! . . . They tell me, Sir, There is no cure for wounds like his. Indeed 'Tis a hard journey that I go upon To such a dismal end! TRAVELLER. He yet may live. But if the worst should chance, why you must bear The will of Heaven with patience. Were it not Some comfort to reflect your son has fallen Fighting his country's cause? and for yourself You will not in unpitied poverty Be left to mourn his loss. Your grateful country, Amid the triumph of her victory, Remembers those who paid its price of blood, And with a noble charity relieves The widow and the orphan. WOMAN. God reward them! God bless them! It will help me in my age, . . But, Sir! it will not pay me for my child! TRAVELLER. Was he your only child? WOMAN. My only one, The stay and comfort of my widowhood, A dear good boy! . . When first he went to sea I felt what it would come to, . . something told me I should be childless soon. But tell me, Sir, If it be true that for a hurt like his There is no cure? Please God to spare his life Though he be blind, yet I should be so thankful! I can remember there was a blind man Lived in our village, one from his youth up Quite dark, and yet he was a merry man, And he had none to tend on him so well As I would tend my boy! TRAVELLER. Of this be sure, His hurts are look'd to well, and the best help The land affords, as rightly is his due, Ever at hand. How happen'd it he left you? Was a seafaring life his early choice? WOMAN. No, Sir! poor fellow, . . he was wise enough To be content at home, and 'twas a home As comfortable, Sir! even though I say it, As any in the country. He was left A little boy when his poor father died, Just old enough to totter by himself, And call his mother's name. We two were all, And as we were not left quite destitute, We bore up well. In the summer time I work'd Sometimes a-field. Then I was famed for knitting, And in long winter nights my spinning wheel Seldom stood still. We had kind neighbours too, And never felt distress. So he grew up A comely lad, and wonderous well disposed; I taught him well; there was not in the parish A child who said his prayers more regular, Or answered readier through his Catechism. If I had foreseen this! but 'tis a blessing We don't know what we're born to! TRAVELLER. But how came it He chose to be a Sailor? WOMAN. You shall hear, Sir; As he grew up he used to watch the birds In the corn, child's work you know, and easily done. 'Tis an idle sort of task; so he built up A little hut of wicker-work and clay Under the hedge, to shelter him in rain: And then he took, for very idleness, To making traps to catch the plunderers; All sorts of cunning traps that boys can make, . . Propping a stone to fall and shut them in, Or crush them with its weight, or else a springe Swung on a bough. He made them cleverly, . . And, I, poor foolish woman! I was pleased To see the boy so handy. You may guess What follow'd, Sir, from this unlucky skill. He did what he should not when he was older: I warn'd him oft enough; but he was caught In wiring hares at last, and had his choice, The prison or the ship. TRAVELLER. The choice at least Was kindly left him; and for broken laws This was, methinks, no heavy punishment. WOMAN. So I was told, Sir. And I tried to think so, But 'twas a sad blow to me! I was used To sleep at nights as sweetly as a child, . . Now if the wind blew rough, it made me start, And think of my poor boy tossing about Upon the roaring seas. And then I seem'd To feel that it was hard to take him from me For such a little fault. But he was wrong, Oh very wrong, . . a murrain on his traps! See what they've brought him to! TRAVELLER. Well! well! take comfort He will be taken care of if he lives; And should you lose your child, this is a country Where the brave Sailor never leaves a parent To weep for him in want. WOMAN. Sir, I shall want No succour long. In the common course of years I soon must be at rest; and 'tis a comfort, When grief is hard upon me, to reflect It only leads me to that rest the sooner. Westbury, 1798. V. THE WITCH. NATHANIEL. Father! here, father! I have found a horse-shoe! Faith it was just in time; for t'other night I laid two straws across at Margery's door, And ever since I fear'd that she might do me A mischief for't. There was the Miller's boy Who set his dog at that black cat of hers, . . I met him upon crutches, and he told me 'Twas all her evil eye. FATHER. 'Tis rare good luck! I would have gladly given a crown for one If 'twould have done as well. But where didst find it? NATHANIEL. Down on the common; I was going a-field, And neighbour Saunders pass'd me on his mare; He had hardly said “Good day,” before I saw The shoe drop off. 'Twas just upon my tongue To call him back; . . it makes no difference does it, Because I know whose 'twas? FATHER. Why no, it can't. The shoe's the same, you know; and you did find it. NATHANIEL. That mare of his has got a plaguey road To travel, father; . . and if he should lame her, . . For she is but tender-footed, . . FATHER. Ay, indeed! . I should not like to see her limping back, Poor beast! . . But charity begins at home, And, Nat, there's our own horse in such a way This morning! NATHANIEL. Why he han't been rid again! Last night I hung a pebble by the manger With a hole through, and every body says That 'tis a special charm against the hags. FATHER. It could not be a proper natural hole then, Or 'twas not a right pebble; . . for I found him Smoking with sweat, quaking in every limb, And panting so! Lord knows where he had been When we were all asleep, through bush and brake, Up-hill and down-hill all alike, full stretch At such a deadly rate! . . NATHANIEL. By land and water, Over the sea, perhaps! . . I have heard tell 'Tis many thousand miles off at the end Of the world, where witches go to meet the Devil. They used to ride on broomsticks, and to smear Some ointment over them, and then away Out at the window! but 'tis worse than all To worry the poor beasts so. Shame upon it That in a Christian country they should let Such creatures live! FATHER. And when there's such plain proof! I did but threaten her because she robb'd Our hedge, and the next night there came a wind That made me shake to hear it in my bed. How came it that that storm unroof'd my barn, And only mine in the parish? . . Look at her, And that's enough; she has it in her face! . . A pair of large dead eyes, sunk in her head, Just like a corpse, and pursed with wrinkles round; A nose and chin that scarce leave room between For her lean fingers to squeeze in the snuff; And when she speaks! I'd sooner hear a raven Croak at my door! . . She sits there, nose and knees, Smoke-dried and shrivell'd over a starved fire, With that black cat beside her, whose great eyes Shine like old Beelzebub's; and to be sure It must be one of his imps! . . Ay, nail it hard. NATHANIEL. I wish old Margery heard the hammer go! She'd curse the music! FATHER. Here's the Curate coming, He ought to rid the parish of such vermin! In the old times they used to hunt them out, And hang them without mercy; but, Lord bless us! The world is grown so wicked! CURATE. Good day, Farmer! Nathaniel, what art nailing to the threshold? NATHANIEL. A horse-shoe, Sir; 'tis good to keep off witchcraft, And we're afraid of Margery. CURATE. Poor old woman! What can you fear from her? FATHER. What can we fear? Who lamed the Miller's boy? who raised the wind That blew my old barn's roof down? who d'ye think Rides my poor horse a' nights? who mocks the hounds? But let me catch her at that trick again, And I've a silver bullet ready for her, One that shall lame her, double how she will. NATHANIEL. What makes her sit there moping by herself. With no soul near her but that great black cat? And do but look at her! CURATE. Poor wretch; half blind And crooked with her years, without a child Or friend in her old age, 'tis hard indeed To have her very miseries made her crimes! I met her but last week in that hard frost Which made my young limbs ache, and when I ask'd What brought her out in the snow, the poor old woman Told me that she was forced to crawl abroad And pick the hedges, just to keep herself From perishing with cold, . . because no neighbour Had pity on her age; and then she cried, And said the children pelted her with snow-balls, And wish'd that she were dead FATHER. I wish she was! She has plagued the parish long enough! CURATE. Shame, Farmer! Is that the charity your Bible teaches? FATHER. My Bible does not teach me to love witches. I know what's charity; who pays his tithes And poor-rates readier? CURATE. Who can better do it? You've been a prudent and industrious man, And God has blest your labour. FATHER. Why, thank God, Sir I've had no reason to complain of fortune. CURATE. Complain? why you are wealthy! All the parish Look up to you. FATHER. Perhaps, Sir, I could tell Guinea for guinea with the warmest of them. CURATE. You can afford a little to the poor; And then, what's better still, you have the heart To give from your abundance. FATHER. God forbid I should want charity! CURATE. Oh! 'tis a comfort To think at last of riches well employ'd! I have been by a death-bed, and know the worth Of a good deed at that most aweful hour When riches profit not. Farmer, I'm going To visit Margery. She is sick, I hear; . . Old, poor and sick! a miserable lot, And death will be a blessing. You might send her Some little matter something comfortable, That she may go down easier to the grave, And bless you when she dies. FATHER. What! is she going? Well God forgive her then, if she has dealt In the black art! I'll tell my dame of it, And she shall send her something. CURATE. So I'll say; And take my thanks for hers. [Goes.] FATHER. That's a good man That Curate, Nat, of ours, to go and visit The poor in sickness; but he don't believe In witchcraft, and that is not like a Christian. NATHANIEL. And so old Margery's dying! FATHER. But you know She may recover: so drive 'tother nail in. Westbury, 1798. VI. THE RUINED COTTAGE. Ay, Charles! I knew that this would fix thine eye; . . This woodbine wreathing round the broken porch. Its leaves just withering, yet one autumn flower Still fresh and fragrant; and yon holly-hock That through the creeping weeds and nettles tall Peers taller, lifting, column-like, a stem Bright with its roseate blossoms. I have seen Many an old convent reverend in decay, And many a time have trod the castle courts And grass-green halls, yet never did they strike Home to the heart such melancholy thoughts As this poor cottage. Look! its little hatch Fleeced with that grey and wintry moss; the roof Part moulder'd in, the rest o'ergrown with weeds, House-leek, and long thin grass, and greener moss; So Nature steals on all the works of man, Sure conqueror she, reclaiming to herself His perishable piles. I led thee here, Charles, not without design; for this hath been My favourite walk even since I was a boy; And I remember, Charles, this ruin here, The neatest comfortable dwelling-place! That when I read in those dear books which first Woke in my heart the love of poesy, How with the villagers Erminia dwelt, And Calidore for a fair shepherdess Forsook his quest to learn the shepherd's lore, My fancy drew from this the little hut Where that poor princess wept her hopeless love, Or where the gentle Calidore at eve Led Pastorella home. There was not then A weed where all these nettles overtop The garden-wall; but sweet-briar, scenting sweet The morning air; rosemary and marjoram, All wholesome herbs; and then, that woodbine wreathed So lavishly around the pillar'd porch Its fragrant flowers, that when I past this way, After a truant absence hastening home, I could not chuse but pass with slacken'd speed By that delightful fragrance. Sadly changed Is this poor cottage! and its dwellers, Charles! . . Theirs is a simple melancholy tale, . . There's scarce a village but can fellow it: And yet, methinks, it will not weary thee, And should not be untold. A widow here Dwelt with an orphan grandchild: just removed Above the reach of pinching poverty, She lived on some small pittance which sufficed, In better times, the needful calls of life, Not without comfort. I remember her Sitting at evening in that open door-way, And spinning in the sun. Methinks I see her Raising her eyes and dark-rimm'd spectacles To see the passer-by, yet ceasing not To twirl her lengthening thread: or in the garden, On some dry summer evening, walking round To view her flowers, and pointing as she lean'd Upon the ivory handle of her stick, To some carnation whose o'erheavy head Needed support; while with the watering-pot Joanna follow'd, and refresh'd and trimm'd The drooping plant; Joanna, her dear child, As lovely and as happy then as youth And innocence could make her. Charles, it seems As though I were a boy again, and all The mediate years with their vicissitudes A half-forgotten dream. I see the Maid So comely in her Sunday dress! her hair, Her bright brown hair, wreathed in contracting curls; And then her cheek! it was a red and white That made the delicate hues of art look loathsome. The countrymen who on their way to church Were leaning o'er the bridge, loitering to hear The bell's last summons, and in idleness Watching the stream below, would all look up When she passed by. And her old Grandam, Charles, . . When I have heard some erring infidel Speak of our faith as of a gloomy creed, Inspiring superstitious wretchedness, Her figure has recurr'd; for she did love The Sabbath-day; and many a time hath cross'd These fields in rain and through the winter snows, When I, a graceless boy, and cold of foot, Wishing the weary service at its end, Have wonder'd wherefore that good dame came there, Who, if it pleased her, might have staid beside A comfortable fire. One only care Hung on her aged spirit. For herself, Her path was plain before her, and the close Of her long journey near. But then her child Soon to be left alone in this bad world, . . . That was a thought which many a winter night Had kept her sleepless; and when prudent love In something better than a servant's state Had placed her well at last, it was a pang Like parting life to part with her dear girl. One summer, Charles, when at the holidays Return'd from school, I visited again My old accustom'd walks, and found in them A joy almost like meeting an old friend, I saw the cottage empty, and the weeds Already crowding the neglected flowers. Joanna, by a villain's wiles seduced, Had play'd the wanton, and that blow had reach'd Her grandam's heart. She did not suffer long; Her age was feeble, and this mortal grief Brought her grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. I pass this ruin'd dwelling oftentimes, And think of other days. It wakes in me A transient sadness; but the feelings, Charles, Which ever with these recollections rise, I trust in God they will not pass away. Westbury, 1799. VII. THE LAST OF THE FAMILY. JAMES. What, Gregory, you are come, I see, to join us On this sad business. GREGORY. Aye, James, I am come, But with a heavy heart, God knows it, man! Where shall we meet the corpse? JAMES. Some hour from hence; By noon, and near about the elms, I take it. This is not as it should be, Gregory, Old men to follow young ones to the grave! This morning when I heard the bell strike out, I thought that I had never heard it toll So dismally before. GREGORY. Well, well! my friend, 'Tis what we all must come to, soon or late. But when a young man dies, in the prime of life, One born so well, who might have blest us all Many long years! . . JAMES. And then the family Extinguish'd in him, and the good old name Only to be remember'd on a tomb-stone! A name that has gone down from sire to son So many generations! . . . Many a time Poor master Edward, who is now a corpse, When but a child, would come to me and lead me To the great family-tree, and beg of me To tell him stories of his ancestors, Of Eustace, he that went to the Holy Land With Richard Lion-heart, and that Sir Henry Who fought at Cressy in King Edward's wars; And then his little eyes would kindle so To hear of their brave deeds! I used to think The bravest of them all would not out-do My darling boy. GREGORY. This comes of your great schools And college-breeding. Plague upon his guardians, That would have made him wiser than his fathers! JAMES. If his poor father, Gregory, had but lived, Things would not have been so. He, poor good man Had little of book-learning, but there lived not A kinder, nobler-hearted gentleman, One better to his tenants. When he died There was not a dry eye for miles around. Gregory, I thought that I could never know A sadder day than that: but what was that, Compared with this day's sorrow? GREGORY. I remember, Eight months ago, when the young Squire began To alter the old mansion, they destroy'd The martins' nests, that had stood undisturb'd Under that roof, . . aye! long before my memory. I shook my head at seeing it, and thought No good could follow. JAMES. Poor young man! I loved him Like my own child. I loved the family! Come Candlemas, and I have been their servant For five-and-forty years. I lived with them When his good father brought my Lady home; And when the young Squire was born, it did me good To hear the bells so merrily announce An heir. This is indeed a heavy blow... I feel it, Gregory, heavier than the weight Of threescore years. He was a noble lad, I loved him dearly. GREGORY. Every body loved him. Such a fine, generous, open-hearted Youth! When he came home from school at holidays, How I rejoiced to see him! He was sure To come and ask of me what birds there were About my fields; and when I found a covey, There's not a testy Squire preserves his game More charily, than I have kept them safe For Master Edward. And he look'd so well Upon a fine sharp morning after them, His brown hair frosted, and his cheek so flush'd With such a wholesome ruddiness, . . ah, James, But he was sadly changed when he came down To keep his birth-day. JAMES. Changed! why, Gregory, 'Twas like a palsy to me, when he stepp'd Out of the carriage. He was grown so thin, His cheek so delicate sallow, and his eyes Had such a dim and rakish hollowness; And when he came to shake me by the hand, And spoke as kindly to me as he used, I hardly knew the voice. GREGORY. It struck a damp On all our merriment. 'Twas a noble Ox That smoked before us, and the old October Went merrily in everflowing cans; But 'twas a skin-deep merriment. My heart Seem'd as it took no share. And when we drank His health, the thought came over me what cause We had for wishing that, and spoilt the draught. Poor Gentleman! to think ten months ago He came of age, and now! JAMES. I fear'd it then! He look'd to me as one that was not long For this world's business. GREGORY. When the Doctor sent him Abroad to try the air, it made me certain That all was over. There's but little hope, Methinks, that foreign parts can help a man When his own mother-country will not do. The last time he came down, these bells rung so I thought they would have rock'd the old steeple down; And now that dismal toll! I would have staid Beyond its reach, but this was a last duty: I am an old tenant of the family, Born on the estate, and now that I've outlived it, Why 'tis but right to see it to the grave. Have you heard aught of the new Squire? JAMES. But little, And that not well. But be he what he may Matters not much to me. The love I bore To the old family will not easily fix Upon a stranger. What's on the opposite hill? Is it not the funeral? GREGORY. 'Tis, I think, some horsemen. Aye! there are the black cloaks; and now I see The white plumes on the hearse. JAMES. Between the trees; . . 'Tis hid behind them now. GREGORY. Aye! now we see it, And there's the coaches following, we shall meet About the bridge. Would that this day were over! I wonder whose turn's next. JAMES. God above knows. When youth is summon'd what must age expect! God make us ready, Gregory, when it comes! Westbury, 1799. VIII. THE WEDDING. TRAVELLER. I pray you, wherefore are the village bells Ringing so merrily? WOMAN. A wedding, Sir, . . Two of the village folk. And they are right To make a merry time on't while they may! Come twelve-months hence, I warrant them they'd go To church again more willingly than now, If all might be undone. TRAVELLER. An ill-match'd pair, So I conceive you. Youth perhaps and age? WOMAN. No, . . both are young enough. TRAVELLER. Perhaps the man then, A lazy idler, . . one who better likes The alehouse than his work? WOMAN. Why, Sir, for that He always was a well-condition'd lad, One who'd work hard and well; and as for drink, Save now and then mayhap at Christmas time, Sober as wife could wish. TRAVELLER. Then is the girl A shrew, or else untidy; . . one to welcome Her husband with a rude unruly tongue! Or drive him from a foul and wretched home To look elsewhere for comfort. Is it so? WOMAN. She's notable enough; and as for temper The best good-humour'd girl! You see yon house, There by the aspen-tree, whose grey leaves shine In the wind? she lived a servant at the farm. And often, as I came to weeding here, I've heard her singing as she milk'd her cows So cheerfully, . . I did not like to hear her, Because it made me think upon the days When I had got as little on my mind, And was as cheerful too. But she would marry, And folks must reap as they have sown. God help her! TRAVELLER. Why Mistress, if they both are well inclined, Why should not both be happy? WOMAN. They've no money. TRAVELLER. But both can work; and sure as cheerfully She'd labour for herself as at the farm. And he wo'n't work the worse because he knows That she will make his fire-side ready for him, And watch for his return. WOMAN. All very well, A little while. TRAVELLER. And what if they are poor? Riches can't always purchase happiness; And much we know will be expected there Where much was given. WOMAN. All this I have heard at church! And when I walk in the church-yard, or have been By a death-bed, 'tis mighty comforting. But when I hear my children cry for hunger, And see them shiver in their rags, . . God help me! I pity those for whom these bells ring up So merrily upon their wedding-day, Because I think of mine. TRAVELLER. You have known trouble; These haply may be happier. WOMAN. Why for that I've had my share; some sickness and some sorrow Well will it be for them to know no worse. Yet I had rather hear a daughter's knell Than her wedding-peal, Sir, if I thought her fate Promised no better things. TRAVELLER. Sure, sure, good woman, You look upon the world with jaundiced eyes! All have their cares; those who are poor want wealth, They who have wealth want more; so are we all Dissatisfied, yet all live on, and each Has his own comforts. WOMAN. Sir! d'ye see that horse Turn'd out to common here by the way-side? He's high in bone, you may tell every rib Even at this distance. Mind him! how he turns His head, to drive away the flies that feed On his gall'd shoulder! There's just grass enough To disappoint his whetted appetite. You see his comforts, Sir! TRAVELLER. A wretched beast! Hard labour and worse usage he endures From some bad master. But the lot of the poor Is not like his. WOMAN. In truth it is not, Sir! For when the horse lies down at night, no cares About to-morrow vex him in his dreams: He knows no quarter-day, and when he gets Some musty hay or patch of hedge-row grass, He has no hungry children to claim part Of his half meal! TRAVELLER. 'Tis idleness makes want, And idle habits. If the man will go And spend his evenings by the alehouse fire, Whom can he blame if there be want at home? WOMAN. Aye! idleness! the rich folks never fail To find some reason why the poor deserve Their miseries! . . Is it idleness, I pray you, That brings the fever or the ague fit? That makes the sick one's sickly appetite From dry bread and potatoes turn away? Is it idleness that makes small wages fail For growing wants? . . Six years agone, these bells Rung on my wedding-day, and I was told What I might look for, . . but I did not heed Good counsel. I had lived in service, Sir; Knew never what it was to want a meal; Lay down without one thought to keep me sleepless Or trouble me in sleep; had for a Sunday My linen gown, and when the pedlar came Could buy me a new ribbon... And my husband, . . A towardly young man and well to do, . . He had his silver buckles and his watch; There was not in the village one who look'd Sprucer on holidays. We married, Sir, And we had children, but while wants increased Wages stood still. The silver buckles went, So went the watch; and when the holiday coat Was worn to work, no new A farmer once told the author of Malvern Hills, “that he almost constantly remarked a gradation of changes in those men he had been in the habit of employing. Young men, he said, were generally neat in their appearance, active and cheerful, till they became married and had a family, when he had observed that their silver buttons, buckles, and watches gradually disappeared, and their Sunday's clothes became common without any other to supply their place, . . but, said he, some good comes from this, for they will then work for whatever they can get.” Note to Cottle's Malvern Hills. one in its place. For me.. you see my rags! but I deserve them, For wilfully, like this new-married pair, I went to my undoing. TRAVELLER. But the parish... WOMAN. Aye, it falls heavy there; and yet their pittance Just serves to keep life in. A blessed prospect, To slave while there is strength, in age the workhouse, A parish shell at last, and the little bell Toll'd hastily for a pauper's funeral! TRAVELLER. Is this your child? WOMAN. Aye, Sir; and were he drest And clean'd, he'd be as fine a boy to look on As the Squire's young master. These thin rags of his Let comfortably in the summer wind; But when the winter comes, it pinches me To see the little wretch; I've three besides; And, . . God forgive me! but I often wish To see them in their coffins... God reward you! God bless you for your charity! TRAVELLER. You have taught me To give sad meaning to the village bells! Bristol, 1800. IX. THE ALDERMAN'S FUNERAL. STRANGER. Whom are they ushering from the world, with all This pageantry and long parade of death? TOWNSMAN. A long parade, indeed, Sir, and yet here You see but half; round yonder bend it reaches A furlong further, carriage behind carriage. STRANGER. 'Tis but a mournful sight, and yet the pomp Tempts me to stand a gazer. TOWNSMAN. Yonder schoolboy Who plays the truant, says the proclamation Of peace was nothing to the show; and even The chairing of the members at election Would not have been a finer sight than this; Only that red and green are prettier colours Than all this mourning. There, Sir, you behold One of the red-gown'd worthies of the city, The envy and the boast of our exchange; . . . Aye, what was worth, last week, a good half-million, Screw'd down in yonder hearse! STRANGER. Then he was born Under a lucky planet, who to-day Puts mourning on for his inheritance. TOWNSMAN. When first I heard his death, that very wish Leapt to my lips; but now the closing scene Of the comedy hath waken'd wiser thoughts; And I bless God, that, when I go to the grave, There will not be the weight of wealth like his To sink me down. STRANGER. The camel and the needle, . . Is that then in your mind? TOWNSMAN. Even so. The text Is Gospel-wisdom. I would ride the camel, . . . Yea leap him flying, through the needle's eye, As easily as such a pamper'd soul Could pass the narrow gate. STRANGER. Your pardon, Sir, But sure this lack of Christian charity Looks not like Christian truth. TOWNSMAN. Your pardon too, Sir, If, with this text before me, I should feel In the preaching mood! But for these barren fig-trees, With all their flourish and their leafiness, We have been told their destiny and use, When the axe is laid unto the root, and they Cumber the earth no longer. STRANGER. Was his wealth Stored fraudfully, . . the spoil of orphans wrong'd, And widows who had none to plead their right? TOWNSMAN. All honest, open, honourable gains, Fair legal interest, bonds and mortgages, Ships to the East and West. STRANGER. Why judge you then So hardly of the dead? TOWNSMAN. For what he left Undone; . . for sins, not one of which is written In the Ten Commandments. He, I warrant him, Believed no other Gods than those of the Creed; Bow'd to no idols, . . but his money-bags; Swore no false oaths, except at the custom-house; Kept the Sabbath idle; built a monument To honour his dead father; did no murder; Never sustain'd an action for crim-con; Never pick'd pockets; never bore false-witness; And never, with that all-commanding wealth, Coveted his neighbour's house, nor ox, nor ass! STRANGER. You knew him then it seems? TOWNSMAN. As all men know The virtues of your hundred-thousanders; They never hide their lights beneath a bushel. STRANGER. Nay, nay, uncharitable Sir! for often Doth bounty like a streamlet flow unseen, Freshening and giving life along its course. TOWNSMAN. We track the streamlet by the brighter green And livelier growth it gives; . . but as for this.. This was a pool that stagnated and stunk; The rains of heaven engendered nothing in it But slime and foul corruption. STRANGER. Yet even these Are reservoirs whence public charity Still keeps her channels full. TOWNSMAN. Now, Sir, you touch Upon the point. This man of half a million Had all these public virtues which you praise: But the poor man rung never at his door, And the old beggar, at the public gate, Who, all the summer long, stands hat in hand, He knew how vain it was to lift an eye To that hard face. Yet he was always found Among your ten and twenty pound subscribers, Your benefactors in the newspapers. His alms were money put to interest In the other world, . . donations to keep open A running charity account with heaven, . . Retaining fees againt the Last Assizes, When, for the trusted talents, strict account Shall be required from all, and the old Arch-Lawyer Plead his own cause as plaintiff. STRANGER. I must needs Believe you, Sir: . . these are your witnesses, These mourners here, who from their carriages Gape at the gaping crowd. A good March wind Were to be pray'd for now, to lend their eyes Some decent rheum; the very hireling mute Bears not a face more blank of all emotion Than the old servant of the family! How can this man have lived, that thus his death Costs not the soiling one white handkerchief! TOWNSMAN. Who should lament for him, Sir, in whose heart Love had no place, nor natural charity? The parlour spaniel, when she heard his step, Rose slowly from the hearth, and stole aside With creeping pace; she never raised her eyes To woo kind words from him, nor laid her head Upraised upon his knee, with fondling whine. How could it be but thus? Arithmetic Was the sole science he was ever taught; The multiplication-table was his Creed, His Pater-noster, and his Decalogue. When yet he was a boy, and should have breathed The open air and sunshine of the fields, To give his blood its natural spring and play, He in a close and dusky counting-house Smoke-dried and sear'd and shrivell'd up his heart. So from the way in which he was train'd up His feet departed not; he toil'd and moil'd, Poor muck-worm! through his three-score years and ten; And when the earth shall now be shovell'd on him, If that which served him for a soul were still Within it's husk, 'twould still be dirt to dirt. STRANGER. Yet your next newspapers will blazon him For industry and honourable wealth A bright example. TOWNSMAN. Even half a million Gets him no other praise. But come this way Some twelve months hence, and you will find his virtues Trimly set forth in lapidary lines, Faith with her torch beside, and little Cupids Dropping upon his urn their marble tears. Bristol, 1803. NONDESCRIPTS. I. WRITTEN THE WINTER AFTER THE INSTALLATION AT OXFORD. 1793. Toll on, toll on, old Bell! I'll neither pass The cold and weary hour in heartless rites, Nor doze away the time. The fire burns bright, And, bless the maker of this Windsor-Chair! (Of polish'd cherry, elbow'd, saddle-seated,) This is the throne of comfort. I will sit And study here devoutly: . . not my Euclid, . . For Heaven forbid that I should discompose That Spider's excellent geometry! I'll study thee, Puss! Not to make a picture, I hate your canvass cats and dogs and fools, Themes that disgrace the pencil. Thou shalt give A moral subject, Puss. Come, look at me; . . Lift up thine emerald eyes! Aye, purr away! For I am praising thee, I tell thee, Puss, And Cats as well as Kings like flattery. For three whole days I heard an old Fur-gown Bepraised, that made a Duke a Chancellor; Bepraised in prose it was, bepraised in verse; Lauded in pious Latin to the skies; Kudos'd egregiously in heathen Greek; In sapphics sweetly incensed; glorified In proud alcaics; in hexameters Applauded to the very Galleries That did applaud again, whose thunder-claps, Higher and longer with redoubling peals Rung, when they heard the illustrious furbelow'd Heroically in Popean rhyme Tee-ti-tum'd, in Miltonic blank bemouth'd; Prose, verse, Greek, Latin, English, rhyme and blank, Apotheosi-chancellor'd in all, Till Eulogy, with all her wealth of words, Grew bankrupt, all-too-prodigal of praise, And panting Panegyrie toil'd in vain O'er-task'd in keeping pace with such desert. Though I can poetize right willingly, Puss, on thy well-streak'd coat, to that Fur-gown I was not guilty of a single line: 'Twas an old furbelow, that would hang loose, And wrap round any one, as it were made To fit him only, so it were but tied With a blue ribband. What a power there is In beauty! Within these forbidden walls Thou hast thy range at will, and when perchance The Fellows see thee, Puss, they overlook Inhibitory laws, or haply think The statute was not made for Cats like thee; For thou art beautiful as ever Cat That wantoned in the joy of kittenhood. Aye, stretch thy claws, thou democratic beast, . . I like thine independence. Treat thee well, Thou art as playful as young Innocence; But if we act the governor, and break The social compact, Nature gave those claws And taught thee how to use them. Man, methinks, Master and slave alike, might learn from thee A salutary lesson: but the one Abuses wickedly his power unjust, The other crouches, spaniel-like, and licks The hand that strikes him. Wiser animal, I look at thee, familiarised, yet free; And, thinking that a child with gentle hand Leads by a string the large-limb'd Elephant, With mingled indignation and contempt Behold his drivers goad the biped beast. II. SNUFF. A delicate pinch! oh how it tingles up The titillated nose, and fills the eyes And breast, till in one comfortable sneeze The full-collected pleasure bursts at last! Most rare Columbus! thou shalt be for this The only Christopher in my Kalendar. Why but for thee the uses of the Nose Were half unknown, and its capacity Of joy. The summer gale that from the heath, At midnoon glowing with the golden gorse, Bears its balsamic odour, but provokes Not satisfies the sense; and all the flowers, That with their unsubstantial fragrance tempt And disappoint, bloom for so short a space, That half the year the Nostrils would keep Lent, But that the kind tobacconist admits No winter in his work; when Nature sleeps His wheels roll on, and still administer A plenitude of joy, a tangible smell. What are Peru and those Golcondan mines To thee, Virginia? miserable realms, The produce of inhuman toil, they sen Gold for the greedy, jewels for the vain. But thine are common comforts! . . To omit Pipe-panegyric and tobacco-praise, Think what the general joy the snuff-box gives, Europe, and far above Pizarro's name Write Raleigh in thy records of renown! Him let the school-boy bless if he behold His master's box produced, for when he sees The thumb and finger of Authority Stufft up the nostrils: when hat, head, and wig Shake all; when on the waistcoat black, brown dust, From the oft reiterated pinch profuse Profusely scattered, lodges in its folds, And part on the magistral table lights, Part on the open book, soon blown away, Full surely soon shall then the brow severe Relax; and from vituperative lips Words that of birch remind not, sounds of praise, And jokes that must be laugh'd at shall proceed. Westbury, 1799. III. COOL REFLECTIONS DURING A MIDSUMMER WALK FROM WARMINSTER TO SHAFTESBURY. 1799. O spare me.. spare me, Phœbus! if indeed Thou hast not let another Phaëton Drive earthward thy fierce steeds and fiery car; Mercy! I melt! I melt! No tree, no bush, No shelter, not a breath of stirring air East, West, or North, or South! Dear God of day, Put on thy nightcap; crop thy locks of light, And be in the fashion; turn thy back upon us, And let thy beams flow upward; make it night Instead of noon; . . one little miracle, In pity, gentle Phœbus! What a joy, Oh what a joy, to be a seal and flounder On an ice island! or to have a den With the white bear, cavern'd in polar snow! It were a comfort to shake hands with Death, . . He has a rare cold hand! to wrap one's self In the gift shirt Dejanira sent, Dipt in the blood of Nessus, just to keep The sun off; or toast cheese for Beelzebub, . . That were a cool employment to this journey Along a road whose white intensity Would now make platina uncongealable Like quicksilver. Were it midnight, I should walk Self-lanthorn'd, saturate with sunbeams. Jove! O gentle Jove! have mercy, and once more Kick that obdurate Phœbus out of heaven; Give Boreas the wind-cholic, till he roar For cardamum, and drink down peppermint, Making what's left as precious as Tokay; Send Mercury to salivate the sky Till it dissolve in rain. O gentle Jove! But some such little kindness to a wretch Who feels his marrow spoiling his best coat, . . Who swells with calorique as if a Prester Had leaven'd every limb with poison-yeast; . . Lend me thine eagle just to flap his wings And fan me, and I will build temples to thee, And turn true Pagan. Not a cloud nor breeze, . . O you most heathen Deities! if ever My bones reach home (for, for the flesh upon them, It hath resolved itself into a dew,) I shall have learnt owl-wisdom. Thou vile Phœbus, Set me a Persian sun-idolater Upon this turnpike road, and I'll convert him With no inquisitorial argument But thy own fires. Now woe be to me, wretch, That I was in a heretic country born! Else might some mass for the poor souls that bleach, And burn away the calx of their offences In that great Purgatory crucible, Help me. O Jupiter! my poor complexion! I am made a copper-Indian of already; And if no kindly cloud will parasol me, My very cellular membrane will be changed, . . I shall be negrofied. A brook! a brook! O what a sweet cool sound! 'Tis very nectar! It runs like life through every strengthen'd limb! Nymph of the stream, now take a grateful prayer. 1799. IV. THE PIG. A COLLOQUIAL POEM. Jacob! I do not like to see thy nose Turn'd up in scornful curve at yonder Pig. It would be well, my friend, if we, like him, Were perfect in our kind! . . And why despise The sow-born grunter? . . He is obstinate, Thou answerest; ugly, and the filthiest beast That banquets upon offal.... Now I pray you Hear the Pig's Counsel. Is he obstinate? We must not, Jacob, be deceived by words; We must not take them as unheeding hands Receive base money at the current worth. But with a just suspicion try their sound, And in the even balance weigh them well. See now to what this obstinacy comes A poor, mistreated, democratic beast, He knows that his unmerciful drivers seek Their profit, and not his. He hath not learnt That Pigs were made for Man, . . born to be brawn'd And baconized: that he must please to give Just what his gracious masters please to take; Perhaps his tusks, the weapons Nature gave For self-defence, the general privilege; Perhaps, . . hark Jacob! dost thou hear that horn? Woe to the young posterity of Pork! Their enemy is at hand. Again. Thou say'st The Pig is ugly. Jacob, look at him! Those eyes have taught the Lover flattery. His face, . . nay Jacob, Jacob! were it fair To judge a Lady in her dishabille? Fancy it drest, and with saltpetre rouged. Behold his tail, my friend; with curls like that The wanton hop marries her stately spouse: So crisp in beauty Amoretta's hair Rings round her lover's soul the chains of love. And what is beauty, but the aptitude Of parts harmonious? Give thy fancy scope, And thou wilt find that no imagined change Can beautify this beast. Place at his end The starry glories of the Peacock's pride, Give him the Swan's white breast; for his horn-hoofs Shape such a foot and ankle as the waves Crowded in eager rivalry to kiss When Venus from the enamour'd sea arose; . . Jacob, thou canst but make a monster of him! All alteration man could think, would mar His Pig-perfection. The last charge, . . he lives A dirty life. Here I could shelter him With noble and right-reverend precedents, And show by sanction of authority That 'tis a very honourable thing To thrive by dirty ways. But let me rest On better ground the unanswerable defence The Pig is a philosopher, who knows No prejudice. Dirt? . . Jacob, what is dirt? If matter, . . why the delicate dish that tempts An o'ergorged Epicure to the last morsel That stuffs him to the throat-gates, is no more. If matter be not, but as Sages say, Spirit is all, and all things visible Are one, the infinitely modified, Think, Jacob, what that Pig is, and the mire Wherein he stands knee-deep! And there! the breeze Pleads with me, and has won thee to a smile That speaks conviction. O'er yon blossom'd field Of beans it came, and thoughts of bacon rise. Westbury, 1799. V. THE DANCING BEAR. RECOMMENDED TO THE ADVOCATES FOR THE SLAVE-TRADE. Rare music! I would rather hear cat-courtship Under my bed-room window in the night, Than this scraped catgut's screak. Rare dancing too! Alas, poor Bruin! How he foots the pole And waddles round it with unwieldly steps, Swaying from side to side! . . The dancing-master Hath had as profitless a pupil in him As when he would have tortured my poor toes To minuet grace, and made them move like clock work In musical obedience. Bruin! Bruin! Thou art but a clumsy biped! . . And the mob With noisy merriment mock his heavy pace, And laugh to see him led by the nose! . . themselves Led by the nose, embruted, and in the eye Of Reason from their Nature's purposes As miserably perverted. Bruin-Bear! Now could I sonnetize thy piteous plight, And prove how much my sympathetic heart Even for the miseries of a beast can feel, In fourteen lines of sensibility. But we are told all things were made for Man; And I'll be sworn there's not a fellow here Who would not swear 'twere hanging blasphemy To doubt that truth. Therefore as thou wert born, Bruin! for Man, and Man makes nothing of thee In any other way, . . . most logically It follows, thou wert born to make him sport; That that great snout of thine was form'd on purpose To hold a ring; and that thy fat was given thee For an approved pomatum! To demur Were heresy. And politicians say, (Wise men who in the scale of reason give No foolish feelings weight,) that thou art here Far happier than thy brother Bears who roam O'er trackless snow for food; that being born Inferior to thy leader, unto him Rightly belongs dominion; that the compact Was made between ye, when thy clumsy feet First fell into the snare, and he gave up His right to kill, conditioning thy life Should thenceforth be his property; . . besides, 'Tis wholesome for thy morals to be brought From savage climes into a civilized state, Into the decencies of Christendom..... Bear! Bear! it passes in the Parliament For excellent logic this! What if we say How barbarously Man abuses power? Talk of thy baiting, it will be replied, Thy welfare is thy owner's interest, But were thou baited it would injure thee, Therefore thou art not baited. For seven years Hear it, O Heaven, and give ear, O Earth! For seven long years this precious syllogism Hath baffled justice and humanity! Westbury, 1799. VI. THE FILBERT. Nay, gather not that Filbert, Nicholas, There is a maggot there, . . it is his house, . . His castle, . . oh commit not burglary! Strip him not naked, . . 'tis his clothes, his shell, His bones, the case and armour of his life, And thou shalt do no murder, Nicholas! It were an easy thing to crack that nut Or with thy crackers or thy double teeth, So easily may all things be destroy'd! But 'tis not in the power of mortal man To mend the fracture of a filbert shell. There were two great men once amused themselves Watching two maggots run their wriggling race, And wagering on their speed; but Nick, to us It were no sport to see the pamper'd worm Roll out and then draw in his folds of fat, Like to some Barber's leathern powder-bag Wherewith he feathers, frosts, or cauliflowers Spruce Beau, or Lady fair, or Doctor grave. Enough of dangers and of enemies Hath Nature's wisdom for the worm ordain'd, Increase not thou the number! Him the Mouse Gnawing with nibbling tooth the shell's defence, May from his native tenement eject; Him may the Nut-hatch, piercing with strong bill, Unwittingly destroy; or to his hoard The Squirrel bear, at leisure to be crack'd. Man also hath his dangers and his foes As this poor Maggot hath; and when I muse Upon the aches, anxieties, and fears, The Maggot knows not, Nicholas, methinks It were a happy metamorphosis To be enkernell'd thus: never to hear Of wars, and of invasions, and of plots, Kings, Jacobines, and Tax-commissioners; To feel no motion but the wind that shook The Filbert Tree, and rock'd us to our rest; And in the middle of such exquisite food To live luxurious! The perfection this Of snugness! it were to unite at once Hermit retirement, Aldermanic bliss, And Stoic independence of mankind. Westbury, 1799. VII. THE CATARACT OF LODORE. DESCRIBED IN RHYMES FOR THE NURSERY. “How does the Water, Come down at Lodore?” My little boy ask'd me Thus, once on a time; And moreover he task'd me To tell him in rhyme. Anon at the word, There first came one daughter And then came another, To second and third The request of their brother, And to hear how the Water Comes down at Lodore, With its rush and its roar. As many a time They had seen it before. So I told them in rhyme, For of rhymes I had store; And 'twas in my vocation For their recreation That so I should sing; Because I was Laureate To them and the King. From its sources which well In the Tarn on the fell; From its fountains In the mountains, It's rills and it's gills; Through moss and through brake, It runs and it creeps For awhile, till it sleeps In its own little Lake. And thence at departing, Awakening and starting, It runs through the reeds And away it proceeds, Through meadow and glade, In sun and in shade, And through the wood-shelter, Among crags in its flurry, Helter-skelter, Hurry-scurry. Here it comes sparkling, And there it lies darkling; Now smoaking and frothing It's tumult and wrath in, Till in this rapid race On which it is bent, It reaches the place Of its steep descent. The Cataract strong Then plunges along, Striking and raging As if a war waging Its caverns and rocks among: Rising and leaping, Sinking and creeping, Swelling and sweeping, Showering and springing, Flying and flinging, Writhing and ringing, Eddying and whisking, Spouting and frisking, Turning and twisting, Around and around With endless rebound; Smiting and fighting, A sight to delight in; Confounding, astounding, Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound. Collecting, projecting, Receding and speeding, And shocking and rocking, And darting and parting, And threading and spreading, And whizzing and hissing, And dripping and skipping, And hitting and splitting, And shining and twining, And rattling and battling, And shaking and quaking, And pouring and roaring, And waving and raving, And tossing and crossing, And flowing and going, And running and stunning, And foaming and roaming, And dinning and spinning, And dropping and hopping, And working and jerking, And guggling and struggling, And heaving and cleaving, And moaning and groaning; And glittering and frittering, And gathering and feathering, And whitening and brightening, And quivering and shivering, And hurrying and skurrying, And thundering and floundering; Dividing and gliding and sliding, And falling and brawling and sprawling, And driving and riving and striving, And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling, And sounding and bounding and rounding, And bubbling and troubling and doubling, And grumbling and rumbling and tumbling, And clattering and battering and shattering; Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting, Delaying and straying and playing and spraying, Advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing, Recoiling, turmoiling and toiling and boiling, And gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming, And rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing, And flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping And curling and whirling and purling and twirling, And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping, And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing; And so never ending, but always descending, Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending, All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar, And this way the Water comes down at Lodore. Keswick, 1820. VIII. ROBERT THE RHYMER'S TRUE AND PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF. Robert the Rhymer who lives at the Lakes Describes himself thus, to prevent mistakes; Or rather, perhaps, be it said, to correct them, There being plenty about for those who collect them. He is lean of body, and lank of limb; The man must walk fast who would overtake him. His eyes are not yet much the worse for the wear, And Time has not thinn'd nor straighten'd his hair, Notwithstanding that now he is more than halfway On the road from Grizzle to Gray. He hath a long nose with a bending ridge; It might be worthy of notice on Strasburg bridge. He sings like a lark when at morn he arises, And when evening comes he nightingalizes, Warbling house-notes wild from throat and gizzard, Which reach from A to G, and from G to Izzard. His voice is as good as when he was young, And he has teeth enough left to keep-in his tongue. A man he is by nature merry, Somewhat Tom-foolish, and comical, very; Who has gone through the world, not mindful of pelf, Upon easy terms, thank Heaven, with himself, Along bypaths and in pleasant ways, Caring as little for censure as praise; Having some friends whom he loves dearly, And no lack of foes, whom he laughs at sincerely; And never for great, nor for little things, Has he fretted his guts to fiddle-strings. He might have made them by such folly Most musical, most melancholy. Sic cecinit Robertus, anno ætatis suæ 55. THE DEVIL'S WALK. 1 From his brimstone bed at break of day A walking the Devil is gone, To look at his little snug farm of the World, And see how his stock went on. 2 Over the hill and over the dale, And he went over the plain; And backward and forward he swish'd his tail, As a gentleman swishes a cane. 3 How then was the Devil drest? Oh, he was in his Sunday's best His coat was red and his breeches were blue, And there was a hole where his tail came through. 4 A lady drove by in her pride, In whose face an expression he spied For which he could have kiss'd her; Such a flourishing, fine, clever creature was she, With an eye as wicked as wicked can be, I should take her for my Aunt, thought he, If my dam had had a sister. 5 He met a lord of high degree, No matter what was his name; Whose face with his own when he came to compare The expression, the look, and the air, And the character too, as it seem'd to a hair,— Such a twin-likeness there was in the pair That it made the Devil start and stare, For he thought there was surely a looking-glass there, But he could not see the frame. 6 He saw a Lawyer killing a viper On a dunghill beside his stable; Ho! quoth he, thou put'st me in mind Of the story of Cain and Abel. 7 An Apothecary on a white horse Rode by on his vocation; And the Devil thought of his old friend Death in the Revelation. 8 He pass'd a cottage with a double coach-house, A cottage of gentility. And he own'd with a grin That his favourite sin Is pride that apes humility. 9 He saw a pig rapidly Down a river float; The pig swam well, but every stroke Was cutting his own throat; 10 And Satan gave thereat his tail A twirl of admiration; For he thought of his daughter War And her suckling babe Taxation. 11 Well enough, in sooth, he liked that truth, And nothing the worse for the jest; But this was only a first thought And in this he did not rest: Another came presently into his head And here it proved, as has often been said, That second thoughts are best. 12 For as Piggy plied with wind and tide, His way with such celerity, And at every stroke the water dyed With his own red blood, the Devil cried, Behold a swinish nation's pride In cotton-spun prosperity. 13 He walk'd into London leisurely, The streets were dirty and dim: But there he saw Brothers the Prophet, And Brothers the Prophet saw him. “After this I was in a vision, having the angel of God near me, and saw Satan walking leisurely into London.”— Brothers' Prophecies, part i. p. 41. 14 He entered a thriving bookseller's shop; Quoth he, We are both of one college, For I myself sate like a Cormorant once Upon the Tree of Knowledge. 15 As he passed through Cold-Bath Fields he look'd At a solitary cell; And he was well-pleased, for it gave him a hint For improving the prisons of Hell. 16 He saw a turnkey tie a thief's hands With a cordial tug and jerk; Nimbly, quoth he, a man's fingers move When his heart is in his work. 17 He saw the same turnkey unfettering a man With little expedition; And he chuckled to think of his dear slave trade, And the long debates and delays that were made Concerning its abolition. 18 He met one of his favourite daughters By an Evangelical Meeting; And forgetting himself for joy at her sight, He would have accosted her outright, And given her a fatherly greeting. 19 But she tipt him a wink, drew back, and cried, Avaunt! my name's Religion! And then she turn'd to the preacher And leer'd like a love-sick pigeon. 20 A fine man and a famous Professor was he, As the great Alexander now may be, Whose fame not yet o'erpast is; Or that new Scotch performer Who is fiercer and warmer, The great Sir Arch-Bombastes. 21 With throbs and throes, and ahs and ohs, Far famed his flock for frightening; And thundering with his voice, the while His eyes zigzag like lightning. 22 This Scotch phenomenon, I trow, Beats Alexander hollow; Even when most tame He breathes more flame Than ten Fire-Kings could swallow. 23 Another daughter he presently met: With music of fife and drum, And a consecrated flag, And shout of tag and rag, And march of rank and file, Which had fill'd the crowded aisle Of the venerable pile, From church he saw her come. 24 He call'd her aside, and began to chide, For what dost thou here? said he; My city of Rome is thy proper home, And there's work enough there for thee. 25 Thou hast confessions to listen, And bells to christen, And altars and dolls to dress; And fools to coax, And sinners to hoax, And beads and bones to bless; And great pardons to sell For those who pay well, And small ones for those who pay less. 26 Nay, Father, I boast, that this is my post, She answered; and thou wilt allow, That the great Harlot, Who is clothed in scarlet, Can very well spare me now. 27 Upon her business I am come here, That we may extend her powers; Whatever lets down this church that we hate, Is something in favour of ours. 28 You will not think, great Cosmocrat! That I spend my time in fooling; Many irons, my Sire, have we in the fire, And I must leave none of them cooling; For you must know state-councils here Are held which I bear rule in. When my liberal notions Produce mischievous motions, There's many a man of good intent, In either house of Parliament, Whom I shall find a tool in; And I have hopeful pupils too Who all this while are schooling. 29 Fine progress they make in our liberal opinions, My Utilitarians, My all sorts of—inians And all sorts of—arians; My all sorts of—ists, And my Prigs and my Whigs Who have all sorts of twists Train'd in the very way, I know, Father, you would have them go; High and low, Wise and foolish, great and small, March-of-Intellect-Boys all. 30 Well pleased wilt thou be at no very far day When the caldron of mischief boils, And I bring them forth in battle array And bid them suspend their broils, That they may unite and fall on the prey, For which we are spreading our toils. How the nice boys all will give mouth at the call, Hark away! hark away to the spoils! My Macs and my Quacks and my lawless-Jacks, My Shiels and O'Connells, my pious Mac-Donnells, My joke-smith Sidney, and all of his kidney, My Humes and my Broughams, My merry old Jerry, My Lord Kings, and my Doctor Doyles! 31 At this good news, so great The Devil's pleasure grew, That with a joyful swish he rent The hole where his tail came through, 32 His countenance fell for a moment When he felt the stitches go; Ah! thought he, there's a job now That I've made for my tailor below. 33 Great news! bloody news! cried a newsman; The Devil said, Stop, let me see! Great news? bloody news? thought the Devil, The bloodier the better for me. 34 So he bought the newspaper, and no news At all, for his money he had. Lving varlet, thought he, thus to take in old Nick! But it's some satisfaction, my lad, To know thou art paid beforehand for the trick, For the sixpence I gave thee is bad. 35 And then it came into his head By oracular inspiration, That what he had seen and what he had said, In the course of this visitation, Would be published in the Morning Post For all this reading nation. 36 Therewith in second-sight he saw The place and the manner and time, In which this mortal story Would be put in immortal rhyme. 37 That it would happen when two poets Should on a time be met, In the town of Nether Stowey, In the shire of Somerset. 38 There while the one was shaving Would he the song begin; And the other when he heard it at breakfast, In ready accord join in. 39 So each would help the other, Two heads being better than one; And the phrase and conceit Would in unison meet, And so with glee the verse flow free, In ding-dong chime of sing-song rhyme, Till the whole were merrily done. 40 And because it was set to the razor, Not to the lute or harp, Therefore it was that the fancy Should be bright, and the wit be sharp. 41 But then, said Satan to himself, As for that said beginner, Against my infernal Majesty There is no greater sinner. 42 He hath put me in ugly ballads With libellous pictures for sale; He hath scoff'd at my hoofs and my horns, And has made very free with my tail. 43 But this Mister Poet shall find I am not a safe subject for whim; For I'll set up a School of my own, And my Poets shall set upon him. 44 He went to a coffee-house to dine, And there he had soy in his dish; Having ordered some soles for his dinner, Because he was fond of flat fish. 45 They are much to my palate, thought he, And now guess the reason who can, Why no bait should be better than place, When I fish for a Parliament-man. 46 But the soles in the bill were ten shillings; Tell your master, quoth he, what I say; If he charges at this rate for all things, He must be in a pretty good way. 47 But mark ye, said he to the waiter, I'm a dealer myself in this line, And his business, between you and me, Nothing like so extensive as mine. 48 Now soles are exceedingly cheap; Which he will not attempt to deny, When I see him at my fish-market, I warrant him, by and by. 49 As he went along the Strand Between three in the morning and four, He observed a queer-looking person Who stagger'd from Perry's door. 50 And he thought that all the world over In vain for a man you might seek, Who could drink more like a Trojan Or talk more like a Greek. 51 The Devil then he prophesied It would one day be matter of talk, That with wine when smitten, And with wit moreover being happily bitten, This erudite bibber was he who had written The story of this walk. 52 A pretty mistake, quoth the Devil; A pretty mistake I opine! I have put many ill thoughts in his mouth, He will never put good ones in mine. 53 And whoever shall say that to Porson These best of all verses belong, He is an untruth-telling whoreson, And so shall be call'd in the song. 54 And if seeking an illicit connection with fame, Any one else should put in a claim, In this comical competition; That excellent poem will prove A man-trap for such foolish ambition, Where the silly rogue shall be caught by the leg, And exposed in a second edition. 55 Now the morning air was cold for him Who was used to a warm abode; And yet he did not immediately wish, To set out on his homeward road. 56 For he had some morning calls to make Before he went back to Hell; So thought he I'll step into a gaming-house, And that will do as well; But just before he could get to the door A wonderful chance befell. 57 For all on a sudden, in a dark place, He came upon General?'s burning face; And it struck him with such consternation, That home in a hurry his way did he take, Because he thought by a slight mistake 'Twas the general conflagration. INSCRIPTIONS. The three utilities of Poetry: the praise of Virtue and Goodness, the memory of things remarkable, and to invigorate the Affections. Welsh Triad. I. FOR A COLUMN AT NEWBURY. Callest thou thyself a Patriot? . . On this field Did Falkland fall, the blameless and the brave, Beneath the banners of that Charles whom thou Abhorrest for a Tyrant. Dost thou boast Of loyalty? The field is not far off Where in rebellious arms against his King Hambden was kill'd, that Hambden at whose name The heart of many an honest Englishman Beats with congenial pride. Both uncorrupt, Friends to their common country both, they fought, They died in adverse armies. Traveller! If with thy neighbour thou shouldst not accord, Remember these, our famous countrymen, And quell all angry and injurious thoughts. Bristol, 1796. II. FOR A CAVERN THAT OVERLOOKS THE RIVER AVON. Enter this cavern, Stranger! Here awhile Respiring from the long and steep ascent, Thou may'st be glad of rest, and haply too Of shade, if from the summer's westering sun Shelter'd beneath this beetling vault of rock. Round the rude portal clasping its rough arms The antique ivy spreads a canopy, From whose grey blossoms the wild bees collect In autumn their last store. The Muses love This spot; believe a Poet who hath felt Their visitation here. The tide below Rising or refluent scarcely sends its sound Of waters up; and from the heights beyond Where the high-hanging forest waves and sways, Varying before the wind its verdant hues, The voice is music here. Here thou may'st feel How good, how lovely, Nature! And when hence Returning to the city's crowded streets, Thy sickening eye at every step revolts From scenes of vice and wretchedness, reflect That Man creates the evil he endures. Bristol, 1796. III. FOR A TABLET AT SILBURY-HILL. This mound in some remote and dateless day Rear'd o'er a Chieftain of the Age of Hills, May here detain thee, Traveller! from thy road Not idly lingering. In his narrow house Some Warrior sleeps below, whose gallant deeds Haply at many a solemn festival The Scald hath sung; but perish'd is the song Of praise, as o'er these bleak and barren downs The wind that passes and is heard no more. Go, Traveller, and remember when the pomp Of earthly Glory fades, that one good deed, Unseen, unheard, unnoted by mankind, Lives in the eternal register of Heaven. Bristol, 1796. IV. FOR A MONUMENT IN THE NEW FOREST. This is the place where William's kingly power Did from their poor and peaceful homes expel, Unfriended, desolate, and shelterless, The habitants of all the fertile track Far as these wilds extend. He levell'd down Their little cottages, he bade their fields Lie waste, and forested the land, that so More royally might he pursue his sports. If that thine heart be human, Passenger! Sure it will swell within thee, and thy lips Will mutter curses on him. Think thou then What cities flame, what hosts unsepulchred Pollute the passing wind, when raging Power Drives on his blood-hounds to the chase of Man; And as thy thoughts anticipate that day When God shall judge aright, in charity Pray for the wicked rulers of mankind. Bristol, 1796. V. FOR A TABLET ON THE BANKS OF A STREAM. Stranger! awhile upon this mossy bank Recline thee. If the Sun rides high, the breeze, That loves to ripple o'er the rivulet, Will play around thy brow, and the cool sound Of running waters soothe thee. Mark how clear They sparkle o'er the shallows, and behold Where o'er their surface wheels with restless speed Yon glossy insect, on the sand below How its swift shadow flits. In solitude The rivulet is pure, and trees and herbs, Bend o'er its salutary course refresh'd, But passing on amid the haunts of men, It finds pollution there, and rolls from thence A tainted stream. Seek'st thou for Happiness? Go, Stranger, sojourn in the woodland cot Of Innocence, and thou shalt find her there. Bristol, 1796. VI. FOR THE CENOTAPH AT ERMENONVILLE. Stranger! the Man of Nature lies not here: Enshrined far distant by the Scoffer's Voltaire. side His relics rest, there by the giddy throng With blind idolatry alike revered. Wiselier directed have thy pilgrim feet Explored the scenes of Ermenonville. Rousseau Loved these calm haunts of Solitude and Peace; Here he has heard the murmurs of the lake, And the soft rustling of the poplar grove, When o'er its bending boughs the passing wind Swept a gray shade. Here, if thy breast be full, If in thine eye the tear devout should gush, His Spirit shall behold thee, to thine home From hence returning, purified of heart. Bristol, 1796. VII. FOR A MONUMENT AT OXFORD. Here Latimer and Ridley in the flames Bore witness to the truth. If thou hast walk'd Uprightly through the world, just thoughts of joy May fill thy breast in contemplating here Congenial virtue. But if thou hast swerved From the straight path of even rectitude, Fearful in trying seasons to assert The better cause, or to forsake the worse Reluctant, when perchance therein enthrall'd Slave to false shame, oh! thankfully receive The sharp compunctious motions that this spot May wake within thee, and be wise in time, And let the future for the past atone. Bath, 1797. VIII. FOR A MONUMENT IN THE VALE OF EWIAS. Here was it, Stranger, that the patron Saint Of Cambria pass'd his age of penitence, A solitary man; and here he made His hermitage, the roots his food, his drink Of Hodney's mountain stream. Perchance thy youth Has read with eager wonder how the Knight Of Wales in Ormandine's enchanted bower Slept the long sleep: and if that in thy veins Flow the pure blood of Britain, sure that blood Hath flow'd with quicker impulse at the tale Of David's deeds, when through the press of war His gallant comrades follow'd his green crest To victory. Stranger! Hatterill's mountain heights And this fair vale of Ewias, and the stream Of Hodney, to thine after-thoughts will rise More grateful, thus associate with the name Of David and the deeds of other days. Bath, 1798. IX. EPITAPH ON ALGERNON SYDNEY. Here Sidney lies, he whom perverted law, The pliant jury and the bloody judge, Doom'd to a traitor's death. A tyrant King Required, an abject country saw and shared The crime. The noble cause of Liberty He loved in life, and to that noble cause In death bore witness. But his Country rose Like Samson from her sleep, and broke her chains, And proudly with her worthies she enroll'd Her murder'd Sidney's name. The voice of man Gives honour or destroys; but earthly power Gives not, nor takes away, the self-applause Which on the scaffold suffering virtue feels, Nor that which God appointed its reward. Westbury, 1798. X. EPITAPH ON KING JOHN. John rests below. A man more infamous Never hath held the sceptre of these realms, And bruised beneath the iron rod of Power The oppressed men of England. Englishman! Curse not his memory. Murderer as he was, Coward and slave, yet he it was who sign'd That Charter which should make thee morn and night Be thankful for thy birth-place: . . . Englishman! That holy Charter, which, shouldst thou permit Force to destroy, or Fraud to undermine, Thy children's groans will persecute thy soul, For they must bear the burthen of thy crime. Westbury, 1798. XI. IN A FOREST. Stranger! whose steps have reach'd this solitude, Know that this lonely spot was dear to one Devoted with no unrequited zeal To Nature. Here, delighted he has heard The rustling of these woods, that now perchance Melodious to the gale of summer move; And underneath their shade on yon smooth rock, With grey and yellow lichens overgrown, Often reclined; watching the silent flow Of this perspicuous rivulet, that steals Along its verdant course, . . till all around Had fill'd his senses with tranquillity, And ever soothed in spirit he return'd A happier, better man. Stranger! perchance, Therefore the stream more lovely to thine eye Will glide along, and to the summer gale The woods wave more melodious. Cleanse thou then The weeds and mosses from this letter'd stone. Westbury, 1798. XII. FOR A MONUMENT AT TORDESILLAS. Spaniard! if thou art one who bows the knee Before a despot's footstool, hie thee hence! This ground is holy: here Padilla died, Martyr of Freedom. But if thou dost love Her cause, stand then as at an altar here, And thank the Almighty that thine honest heart, Full of a brother's feelings for mankind, Revolts against oppression. Not unheard Nor unavailing shall the grateful prayer Ascend; for honest impulses will rise, Such as may elevate and strengthen thee For virtuous action. Relics silver-shrined, And chaunted mass, would wake within the soul Thoughts valueless and cold compared with these. Bristol, 1796. XIII. FOR A COLUMN AT TRUXILLO. Pizarro here was born; a greater name The list of Glory boasts not. Toil and Pain, Famine and hostile Elements, and Hosts Embattled, fail'd to check him in his course, Not to be wearied, not to be deterr'd, Not to be overcome. A mighty realm He over-ran, and with relentless arm Slew or enslaved its unoffending sons, And wealth, and power, and fame, were his rewards. There is another world, beyond the Grave, According to their deeds where men are judged. O Reader! if thy daily bread be earn'd By daily labour, . . yea, however low, However painful be thy lot assign'd, Thank thou, with deepest gratitude, the God Who made thee, that thou art not such as he. Bristol, 1796. XIV. FOR THE CELL OF HONORIUS, AT THE CORK CONVENT, NEAR CINTRA. Here cavern'd like a beast Honorius pass'd In self-affliction, solitude, and prayer, Long years of penance. He had rooted out All human feelings from his heart, and fled With fear and loathing from all human joys. Not thus in making known his will divine Hath Christ enjoin'd. To aid the fatherless, Comfort the sick, and be the poor man's friend, And in the wounded heart pour gospel-balm; These are the injunctions of his holy law, Which whoso keeps shall have a joy on earth, Calm, constant, still increasing, preluding The eternal bliss of Heaven. Yet mock not thou, Stranger, the Anchorite's mistaken zeal! He painfully his painful duties kept, Sincere though erring: Stranger, do thou keep Thy better and thine easier rule as well. Bristol, 1796. XV. FOR A MONUMENT AT TAUNTON. They suffer'd here whom Jefferies doom'd to death In mockery of all justice, when the Judge Unjust, subservient to a cruel King, Perform'd his work of blood. They suffer'd here The victims of that Judge, and of that King; In mockery of all justice here they bled, Unheard. But not unpitied, nor of God Unseen, the innocent suffered; not unheard The innocent blood cried vengeance; for at length The indignant Nation in its power arose, Resistless. Then that wicked Judge took flight, Disguised in vain: . . not always is the Lord Slow to revenge! A miserable man He fell beneath the people's rage, and still The children curse his memory. From the throne The obdurate bigot who commission'd him, Inhuman James, was driven. He lived to drag Long years of frustrate hope, he lived to load More blood upon his soul. Let tell the Boyne, Let Londonderry tell his guilt and shame; And that immortal day when on thy shores, La Hogue, the purple ocean dash'd the dead! Westbury, 1798. XVI. FOR A TABLET AT PENSHURST. Are days of old familiar to thy mind, O Reader? Hast thou let the midnight hour Pass unperceived, whilst thou in fancy lived With high-born beauties and enamour'd chiefs, Sharing their hopes, and with a breathless joy Whose expectation touch'd the verge of pain, Following their dangerous fortunes? If such lore Hath ever thrill'd thy bosom, thou wilt tread, As with a pilgrim's reverential thoughts, The groves of Penshurst. Sydney here was born. Sydney, than whom no gentler, braver man His own delightful genius ever feign'd, Illustrating the vales of Arcady With courteous courage and with loyal loves. Upon his natal day an acorn here Was planted: it grew up a stately oak, And in the beauty of its strength it stood And flourish'd, when his perishable part Had moulder'd, dust to dust. That stately oak Itself hath moulder'd now, but Sydney's fame Endureth in his own immortal works. Westbury, 1799. XVII. EPITAPH. This to a mother's sacred memory Her son hath hallow'd. Absent many a year Far over sea, his sweetest dreams were still Of that dear voice which soothed his infancy; And after many a fight against the Moor And Malabar, or that fierce cavalry Which he had seen covering the boundless plain, Even to the utmost limits where the eye Could pierce the far horizon, . . his first thought In safety was of her, who when she heard The tale of that day's danger, would retire And pour her pious gratitude to Heaven In prayers and tears of joy. The lingering hour Of his return, long-look'd-for, came at length, And full of hope he reach'd his native shore. Vain hope that puts its trust in human life! For ere he came, the number of her days Was full. O Reader, what a world were this, How unendurable its weight, if they Whom Death hath sunder'd did not meet again! Keswick, 1810. XVIII. EPITAPH. Here in the fruitful vales of Somerset Was Emma born, and here the Maiden grew To the sweet season of her womanhood Beloved and lovely, like a plant whose leaf And bud and blossom all are beautiful. In peacefulness her virgin years were past; And when in prosperous wedlock she was given, Amid the Cumbrian mountains far away She had her summer Bower. 'Twas like a dream Of old Romance to see her when she plied Her little skiff on Derwent's glassy lake; The roseate evening resting on the hills, The lake returning back the hues of heaven, Mountains and vales and waters all imbued With beauty, and in quietness; and she, Nymph-like, amid that glorious solitude A heavenly presence, gliding in her joy But soon a wasting malady began To prey upon her, frequent in attack, Yet with such flattering intervals as mock The hopes of anxious love, and most of all The sufferer, self-deceived. During those days Of treacherous respite, many a time hath he, Who leave this record of his friend, drawn back Into the shadow from her social board, Because too surely in her cheek he saw The insidious bloom of death; and then her smiles And innocent mirth excited deeper grief Than when long-look'd-for tidings came at last, That, all her sufferings ended, she was laid Amid Madeira's orange groves to rest. O gentle Emma! o'er a lovelier form Than thine, Earth never closed; nor e'er did Heaven Receive a purer spirit from the world. Keswick, 1810. XIX. FOR A MONUMENT AT ROLISSA. Time has been when Rolissa was a name Ignoble, by the passing traveller heard And then forthwith forgotten; now in war It is renown'd. For when to her ally, In bondage by perfidious France oppress'd, England sent succour, first within this realm The fated theatre of their long strife Confronted, here the hostile nations met. Laborde took here his stand; upon yon point Of Mount Saint Anna was his Eagle fix'd; The veteran chief, disposing well all aid Of height and glen, possess'd the mountain straits, A post whose strength thus mann'd and profited Seem'd to defy the enemy and make The vantage of assailing numbers vain. Here, too, before the sun should bend his course Adown the slope of heaven, so had their plans Been timed, he look'd for Loison's army, rich With spoils from Evora and Beja sack'd. That hope the British Knight areeding well, With prompt attack prevented; and nor strength Of ground, nor leader's skill, nor discipline Of soldiers practised in the ways of war, Avail'd that day against the British arm. Resisting long, but beaten from their stand, The French fell back; they join'd their greater host To suffer fresh defeat, and Portugal First for Sir Arthur wreathed her laurels here. XX. FOR A MONUMENT AT VIMEIRO. This is Vimeiro; yonder stream which flows Westward through heathery highlands to the sea, Is call'd Maceira, till of late a name, Save to the dwellers of this peaceful vale, Known only to the coasting mariner; Now in the bloody page of war inscribed. When to the aid of injured Portugal Struggling against the intolerable yoke Of treacherous France, England her old ally, Long tried and always faithful found, went forth, The embattled hosts in equal strength array'd, And equal discipline, encountered here. Junot, the mock Abrantes, led the French, And confident of skill so oft approved, And vaunting many a victory, advanced Against an untried foe. But when the ranks Met in the shock of battle, man to man, And bayonet to bayonet opposed, The flower of France cut down along their line, Fell like ripe grass before the mower's scythe, For the strong arm and rightful cause prevail'd. That day deliver'd Lisbon from the yoke, And babes were taught to bless Sir Arthur's name. XXI. AT CORUÑA. When from these shores the British army first Boldly advanced into the heart of Spain, The admiring people who beheld its march Call'd it “the Beautiful.” And surely well Its proud array, its perfect discipline, Its ample furniture of war compleat, Its powerful horse, its men of British mould, All high in heart and hope, all of themselves Assured, and in their leaders confident, Deserved the title. Few short weeks elapsed Ere hither that disastrous host return'd, A fourth of all its gallant force consumed In hasty and precipitate retreat, Stores treasure and artillery, in the wreck Left to the fierce pursuer, horse and man Founder'd, and stiffening on the mountain snows. But when the exulting enemy approach'd Boasting that he would drive into the sea The remnant of the wretched fugitives, Here ere they reach'd their ships, they turn'd at bay. Then was the proof of British courage seen; Against a foe far overnumbering them, An insolent foe, rejoicing in pursuit, Sure of the fruit of victory, whatsoe'er Might be the fate of battle, here they stood And their safe embarkation, . . all they sought, Won manfully. That mournful day avenged Their sufferings, and redeem'd their country's name And thus Coruña, which in this retreat Had seen the else indelible reproach Of England, saw the stain effaced in blood. XXII. EPITAPH. He who in this unconsecrated ground Obtain'd a soldier's grave, hath left a name Which will endure in history: the remains Of Moore, the British General, rest below. His early prowess Corsica beheld, When, at Mozello, bleeding, through the breach He passed victorious; the Columbian isles Then saw him tried; upon the sandy downs Of Holland was his riper worth approved; And leaving on the Egyptian shores his blood, He gathered there fresh palms. High in repute A gallant army last he led to Spain, In arduous times; for moving in his strength, With all his mighty means of war compleat, The Tyrant Buonaparte bore down all Before him; and the British Chief beheld, Where'er he look'd, rout, treason, and dismay, All sides with all embarrassments beset, And danger pressing on. Hither he came Before the far out-numbering hosts of France Retreating to her ships, and close pursued; Nor were there wanting men who counsell'd him To offer terms, and from the enemy Purchase a respite to embark in peace, At price of such abasement, . . even to this, Brave as they were, by hopelessness subdued. That shameful counsel Moore, in happy hour Remembering what was due to England's name, Refused; he fought, he conquer'd, and he fell. XXIII. TO THE MEMORY OF PAUL BURRARD, MORTALLY WOUNDED IN THE BATTLE OF CORUÑA. Mysterious are the ways of Providence!— Old men who have grown grey in camps, and wish'd, And pray'd, and sought in battle to lay down The burthen of their age, have seen the young Fall round, themselves untouch'd; and balls beside The graceless and the unblest head have past, Harmless as hail, to reach some precious life, For which clasp'd hands, and supplicating eyes, Duly at morn and eve were raised to Heaven; And, in the depth and loneness of the soul (Then boding all too truly), midnight prayers Breathed from an anxious pillow wet with tears. But blessed, even amid their grief, are they Who, in the hour of visitation, bow Beneath the unerring will, and look toward Their Heavenly Father, merciful as just! They, while they own his goodness, feel that whom He chastens, them he loves. The cup he gives, Shall they not drink it? Therefore doth the draught Resent of comfort in its bitterness, And carry healing with it. What but this Could have sustain'd the mourners who were left. With life-long yearnings, to remember him Whose early death this monumental verse Records? For never more auspicious hopes Were nipt in flower, nor finer qualities From goodliest fabric of mortality Divorced, nor virtues worthier to adorn The world transferr'd to heaven, than when, 'ere time Had measured him the space of nineteen years, Paul Burrard on Coruña's fatal field Received his mortal hurt. Not unprepared The heroic youth was found: for in the ways Of piety had he been trained; and what The dutiful child upon his mother's knees Had learnt, the soldier faithfully observed. In chamber or in tent, the Book of God Was his beloved manual; and his life Beseem'd the lessons which from thence he drew. For, gallant as he was, and blithe of heart, Expert of hand, and keen of eye, and prompt In intellect, religion was the crown Of all his noble properties. When Paul Was by, the scoffer, self-abased, restrain'd The license of his speech; and ribaldry Before his virtuous presence sate rebuked. And yet so frank and affable a form His virtue wore, that wheresoe'er he moved A sunshine of good-will and cheerfulness Enliven'd all around. Oh! marvel not, If, in the morning of his fair career, Which promised all that honour could bestow On high desert, the youth was summon'd hence! His soul required no farther discipline, Pure as it was, and capable of Heaven. Upon the spot from whence he just had seen His General borne away, the appointed ball Reach'd him. But not on that Gallician ground Was it his fate, like many a British heart, To mingle with the soil; the sea received His mortal relics, . . to a watery grave Consign'd so near his native shore, so near His father's house, that they who loved him best, Unconscious of its import, heard the gun Which fired his knell. — Alas! if it were known, When, in the strife of nations, dreadful Death Mows down with indiscriminating sweep His thousands ten times told, . . if it were known What ties are sever'd then, what ripening hopes Blasted, what virtues in their bloom cut off; How far the desolating scourge extends; How wide the misery spreads; what hearts beneath Their grief are broken, or survive to feel Always the irremediable loss; Oh! who of woman born could bear the thought? Who but would join with fervent piety The prayer that asketh in our time for peace?— Nor in our time alone! — Enable us, Father which art in heaven! but to receive And keep thy word: thy kingdom then should come, Thy will be done on earth; the victory Accomplished over Sin as well as Death, And the great scheme of Providence fulfill'd. XXIV. FOR THE BANKS OF THE DOURO. Crossing in unexampled enterprize This great and perilous stream, the English host Effected here their landing, on the day When Soult from Porto with his troops was driven. No sight so joyful ever had been seen From Douro's banks, . . not when the mountains sent Their generous produce down, or homeward fleets Entered from distant seas their port desired; Nor e'er were shouts of such glad mariners So gladly heard, as then the cannon's peal, And short sharp strokes of frequent musketry, By the delivered habitants that hour. For they who beaten then and routed fled Before victorious England, in their day Of triumph, had, like fiends let loose from hell, Fill'd yon devoted city with all forms Of horror, all unutterable crimes; And vengeance now had reach'd the inhuman race Accurst. Oh what a scene did Night behold Within those rescued walls, when festal fires, And torches, blazing through the bloody streets, Stream'd their broadlight where horse and man in death Unheeded lay outstretch'd! Eyes which had wept In bitterness so long, shed tears of joy, And from the broken heart thanksgiving mix'd With anguish rose to Heaven. Sir Arthur then Might feel how precious in a righteous cause, Is victory, how divine the soldier's meed When grateful nations bless the avenging sword! XXV. TALAVERA. FOR THE FIELD OF BATTLE. Yon wide-extended town, whose roofs and towers And poplar avenues are seen far off, In goodly prospect over scatter'd woods Of dusky ilex, boasts among its sons Of Mariana's name, . . he who hath made The splendid story of his country's wars Through all the European kingdoms known. Yet in his ample annals thou canst find No braver battle chronicled, than here Was waged, when Joseph of the stolen crown, Against the hosts of England and of Spain His veteran armies brought. By veteran chiefs Captain'd, a formidable force they came, Full fifty thousand. Victor led them on, A man grown grey in arms, nor e'er in aught Dishonoured, till by this opprobrious cause. He over rude Alverche's summer stream Winning his way, made first upon the right His hot attack, where Spain's raw levies, ranged In double line, had taken their strong stand In yonder broken ground, by olive groves Cover'd and flank'd by Tagus. Soon from thence, As one whose practised eye could apprehend All vantages in war, his troops he drew; And on this hill, the battle's vital point, Bore with collected power, outnumbering The British ranks twice told. Such fearful odds Were balanced by Sir Arthur's master mind And by the British heart. Twice during night The fatal spot they storm'd, and twice fell back, Before the bayonet driven. Again at morn They made their fiery onset, and again Repell'd, again at noon renew'd the strife. Yet was their desperate perseverance vain, Where skill by equal skill was countervail'd And numbers by superior courage foil'd; And when the second night drew over them Its sheltering cope, in darkness they retired, At all points beaten. Long in the red page Of war, shall Talavera's famous name Stand forth conspicuous. While that name endures, Bear in thy soul, O Spain, the memory Of all thou suffered'st from perfidious France, Of all that England in thy cause achieved. XXVI. FOR THE DESERTO DE BUSACO. Reader, thou standest upon holy ground Which Penitence hath chosen for itself, And war disturbing the deep solitude Hath left it doubly sacred. On these heights The host of Portugal and England stood, Arrayed against Massena, when the chief Proud of Rodrigoo and Almeida won, Press'd forward, thinking the devoted realm Full sure should fall a prey. He in his pride Scorn'd the poor numbers of the English foe, And thought the children of the land would fly From his advance, like sheep before the wolf, Scattering, and lost in terror. Ill he knew The Lusitanian spirit! Ill he knew The arm, the heart of England! Ill he knew Her Wellington! He learnt to know them here. That spirit and that arm, that heart, that mind, Here on Busaco gloriously display'd, When hence repulsed the beaten boaster wound Below, his course circuitous, and left His thousands for the beasts and ravenous fowl. The Carmelite who in his cell recluse Was wont to sit, and from a skull receive Death's silent lesson, whereso'er he walk Henceforth may find his teachers. He shall find The Frenchmen's bones in glen and grove, on rock And height, where'er the wolves and carrion birds Have strewn them, wash'd in torrents, bare and bleach'd By sun and rain and by the winds of heaven. XXVII. FOR THE LINES OF TORRES VEDRAS. Through all Iberia, from the Atlantic shores To far Pyrene, Wellington hath left His trophies; but no monument records To after-time a more enduring praise, Than this which marks his triumph here attain'd By intellect, and patience to the end Holding through good and ill its course assign'd, The stamp and seal of greatness. Here the chief Perceived in foresight Lisbon's sure defence, A vantage ground for all reverse prepared, Where Portugal and England might defy All strength of hostile numbers. Not for this Of hostile enterprize did he abate, Or gallant purpose: witness the proud day Which saw Soult's murderous host from Porto driven Bear witness Talavera, made by him Famous for ever; and that later fight When from Busaco's solitude the birds, Then first affrighted in their sanctuary, Fled from the thunders and the fires of war. But when Spain's feeble counsels, in delay As erring, as in action premature, Had left him in the field without support, And Buonaparte having trampled down The strength and pride of Austria, this way turn'd His single thought and undivided power, Retreating hither the great General came; And proud Massena, when the boastful chief Of plundered Lisbon dreamt, here found himself Stopt suddenly in his presumptuous course. From Ericeyra on the western sea, By Mafra's princely convent, and the heights Of Montichique, and Bucellas famed For generous vines, the formidable works Extending, rested on the guarded shores Of Tagus, that rich river who received Into his ample and rejoicing port, The harvests and the wealth of distant lands, Secure, insulting with the glad display The robber's greedy sight. Five months the foe Beheld these lines, made inexpugnable By perfect skill, and patriot feelings here With discipline conjoin'd, courageous hands, True spirits, and one comprehensive mind All overseeing and pervading all. Five months, tormenting still his heart with hope, He saw his projects frustrated; the power Of the blaspheming tyrant whom he served Fail in the proof; his thousands disappear, In silent and inglorious war consumed; Till hence retreating, madden'd with despite, Here did the self-styled Son of Victory leave, Never to be redeem'd, that vaunted name. XXVIII. AT SANTAREM. Four months Massena had his quarters here, When by those lines deterr'd where Wellington Defied the power of France, but loth to leave Rich Lisbon yet unsack'd, he kept his ground, Till from impending famine, and the force Array'd in front, and that consuming war Which still the faithful nation, day and night, And at all hours was waging on his rear, He saw no safety, save in swift retreat. Then of his purpose frustrated, this child Of Hell, . . so fitlier than of Victory call'd, Gave his own devilish nature scope, and let His devilish army loose. The mournful rolls That chronicle the guilt of humankind, Tell not of aught more hideous than the deeds With which this monster and his kindred troops Track'd their inhuman way; all cruelties, All forms of horror, all deliberate crimes, Which tongue abhors to utter, ear to hear. Let this memorial bear Massena's name For everlasting infamy inscribed. XXIX. AT FUENTES D'ONORO. The fountains of Onoro which give name To this poor hamlet, were distain'd with blood, What time Massena, driven from Portugal By national virtue in endurance proved, And England's faithful aid, against the land Not long delivered, desperately made His last fierce effort here. That day, bestreak'd With slaughter Coa and Agueda ran, So deeply had the open veins of war Purpled their mountain feeders. Strong in means, With rest, and stores, and numbers reinforced, Came the ferocious enemy, and ween'd Beneath their formidable cavalry To trample down resistance. But there fought Against them here, with Britons side by side, The children of regenerate Portugal, And their own crimes, and all-beholding Heaven. Beaten, and hopeless thenceforth of success The inhuman Marshal, never to be named By Lusitanian lips without a curse Of clinging infamy, withdrew and left These Fountains famous for his overthrow. XXX. AT BARROSA. Though the four quarters of the world have seen The British valour proved triumphantly Upon the French, in many a field far-famed, Yet may the noble Island in her rolls Of glory write Barrosa's name. For there, Not by the issue of deliberate plans Consulted well, was the fierce conflict won, Nor by the leader's eye intuitive, Nor force of either arm of war, nor art Of skill'd artillerist, nor the discipline Of troops to absolute obedience train'd; But by the spring and impulse of the heart, Brought fairly to the trial, when all else Seem'd, like a wrestler's garment, thrown aside; By individual courage and the sense Of honour, their old country's, and their own, There to be forfeited, or there upheld; . . This warm'd the soldier's soul, and gave his hand The strength that carries with it victory. More to enhance their praise, the day was fought Against all circumstance; a painful march, Through twenty hours of night and day prolong'd Forespent the British troops; and hope delay'd Had left their spirits pall'd. But when the word Was given to turn, and charge, and win the heights The welcome order came to them, like rain Upon a traveller in the thirsty sands. Rejoicing, up the ascent, and in the front Of danger, they with steady step advanced, And with the insupportable bayonet Drove down the foe. The vanquished Victor sav And thought of Talavera, and deplored His eagle lost. But England saw well-pleased Her old ascendency that day sustain'd; And Scotland shouting over all her hills, Among her worthies rank'd another Graham. XXXI. FOR A MONUMENT AT ALBUHERA. Seven thousand men lay bleeding on these heights, When Beresford in strenuous conflict strove Against a foe whom all the accidents Of battle favoured, and who knew full well To seize all offers that occasion gave. Wounded or dead, seven thousand here were stretch'd, And on the plain around a myriad more, Spaniard and Briton and true Portugueze, Alike approved that day; and in the cause Of France, with her flagitious sons compell'd, Pole and Italian, German, Hollander, Men of all climes and countries, hither brought, Doing and suffering, for the work of war. This point by her superior cavalry France from the Spaniard won, the elements Aiding her powerful efforts; here a while She seem'd to rule the conflict; and from hence The British and the Lusitanian arm Dislodged with irresistible assault The enemy, even when he deem'd the day Was written for his own. But not for Soult, But not for France was that day in the rolls Of war to be inscribed by Victory's hand, Not for the inhuman chief, and cause unjust; She wrote for aftertimes in blood the names Of Spain and England, Blake and Beresford. XXXII. TO THE MEMORY OF SIR WILLIAM MYERS. Spaniard or Portugueze! tread reverently Upon a soldier's grave; no common heart Lies mingled with the clod beneath thy feet. To honours and to ample wealth was Myers In England born; but leaving friends beloved, And all allurements of that happy land, His ardent spirit to the field of war Impell'd him. Fair was his career. He faced The perils of that memorable day, When through the iron shower and fiery storm Of death, the dauntless host of Britain made Their landing at Aboukir; then not less Illustrated, than when great Nelson's hand, As if insulted Heaven with its own wrath Had arm'd him, smote the miscreant Frenchmen's fleet, And with its wreck wide-floating many a league Strew'd the rejoicing shores. What then his youth Held forth of promise, amply was confirm'd When Wellesley, upon Talavera's plain, On the mock monarch won his coronet: There when the trophies of the field were reap'd Was he for gallant bearing eminent When all did bravely. But his valour's orb Shone brightest at its setting. On the field Of Albuhera he the fusileers Led to regain the heights, and promised them A glorious day; a glorious day was given; The heights were gain'd, the victory was achieved, And Myers received from death his deathless crown. Here to Valverde was he borne, and here His faithful men amid this olive grove, The olive emblem here of endless peace, Laid him to rest. Spaniard or Portugueze, In your good cause the British soldier fell; Tread reverently upon his honour'd grave. XXXIII. EPITAPH. Steep is the soldier's path; nor are the heights Of glory to be won without long toil And arduous efforts of enduring hope; Save when Death takes the aspirant by the hand, And cutting short the work of years, at once Lifts him to that conspicuous eminence. Such fate was mine. — The standard of the Buffs I bore at Albuhera, on that day When, covered by a shower, and fatally For friends misdeem'd, the Polish lancers fell Upon our rear. Surrounding me, they claim'd My precious charge. — “Not but with life!” I cried, And life was given for immortality. The flag which to my heart I held, when wet With that heart's blood, was soon victoriously Regain'd on that great day. In former times, Marlborough beheld it borne at Ramilies; For Brunswick and for liberty it waved Triumphant at Culloden; and hath seen The lilies on the Caribbean shores Abased before it. Then too in the front Of battle did it flap exultingly, When Douro, with its wide stream interposed, Saved not the French invaders from attack, Discomfiture, and ignominious rout. My name is Thomas: undisgraced have I Transmitted it. He who in days to come May bear the honour'd banner to the field, Will think of Albuhera, and of me. XXXIV. FOR THE WALLS OF CIUDAD RODRIGO. Here Craufurd fell, victorious, in the breach, Leading his countrymen in that assault Which won from haughty France these rescued walls: And here intomb'd far from his native land And kindred dust, his honour'd relics rest. Well was he versed in war, in the Orient train'd Beneath Cornwallis; then for many a year Following through arduous and ill-fated fields The Austrian banners; on the sea-like shores Of Plata next, still by malignant stars Pursued; and in that miserable retreat, For which Coruña witness'd on her hills The pledge of vengeance given. At length he saw, Long woo'd and well deserved, the brighter face Of Fortune, upon Coa's banks vouchsafed, Before Almeida, when Massena found The fourfold vantage of his numbers foil'd, Before the Briton, and the Portugal, There vindicating first his old renown, And Craufurd's mind that day presiding there. Again was her auspicious countenance Upon Busaco's holy heights reveal'd; And when by Torres Vedras, Wellington, Wisely secure, defied the boastful French, With all their power; and when Onoro's springs Beheld that execrable enemy Again chastised beneath the avenging arm. Too early here his honourable course He closed, and won his noble sepulchre. Where should the soldier rest so worthily As where he fell? Be thou his monument, O City of Rodrigo, yea be thou, To latest time, his trophy and his tomb! Sultans, or Pharaohs of the elder world, Lie not in Mosque or Pyramid enshrined Thus gloriously, nor in so proud a grave. XXXV. TO THE MEMORY OF MAJOR GENERAL MACKINNON. Son of an old and honourable house, Henry Mackinnon from the Hebrides Drew his descent, but upon English ground An English mother bore him. Dauphiny Beheld the blossom of his opening years; For hoping in that genial clime to save A child of feebler frame, his parents there Awhile their sojourn fix'd: and thus it chanced That in that generous season, when the heart Yet from the world is pure and undefiled, Napoleon Buonaparte was his friend. The adventurous Corsican, like Henry, then Young, and a stranger in the land of France, Their frequent and their favour'd guest became, Finding a cheerful welcome at all hours, Kindness, esteem, and in the English youth Quick sympathy of apprehensive mind And lofty thought heroic. On the way Of life they parted, not to meet again. Each follow'd war, but, oh! how differently Did the two spirits which till now had grown Like two fair plants, it seem'd, of kindred seed, Develope in that awful element! For never had benignant nature shower'd More bounteously than on Mackinnon's head Her choicest gifts. Form, features, intellect, Were such as might at once command and win All hearts. In all relationships approved, Son, brother, husband, father, friend, his life Was beautiful; and when in tented fields, Such as the soldier should be in the sight Of God and man was he. Poor praise it were To speak his worth evinced upon the banks Of Douro, Talavera's trophied plain, Busaco's summit, and what other days, Many and glorious all, illustrated His bright career. Worthier of him to say That in the midst of camps his manly breast Retain'd its youthful virtue; that he walk'd Through blood and evil uncontaminate, And that the stern necessity of war But nurtured with its painful discipline Thoughtful compassion in that gentle soul, And feelings such as man should cherish still For all of woman born. He met his death When at Rodrigo on the breach he stood Triumphant; to a soldier's wish it came Instant, and in the hour of victory. Mothers and maids of Portugal, oh bring Your garlands here, and strew his grave with flowers; And lead the children to his monument, Grey-headed sires, for it is holy ground! For tenderness and valour in his heart, As in your own Nunalures, had made Their habitation; for a dearer life. Never in battle hath been offered up, Since in like cause and in unhappy day, By Zutphen's walls the peerless Sydney fell. 'Tis said that Buonaparte, when he heard How thus among the multitude whose blood Cries out to Heaven upon his guilty head, His early friend had fallen, was touch'd with grief. If aught it may avail him, be that thought, That brief recurrence of humanity In his hard heart, remember'd in his hour. XXXVI. FOR THE AFFAIR AT ARROYO MOLINOS. He who may chronicle Spain's arduous strife Against the Intruder, hath to speak of fields Profuselier fed with blood, and victories Borne wider on the wings of glad report; Yet shall this town, which from the mill-stream takes Its humble name, be storied as the spot Where the vain Frenchman, insolent too long Of power and of success, first saw the strength Of England in prompt enterprize essayed, And felt his fortunes ebb, from that day forth Swept back upon the refluent tide of war. Girard lay here, who late from Caceres, Far as his active cavalry could scour, Had pillaged and opprest the country round; The Spaniard and the Portugueze he scorn'd, And deem'd the British soldiers all too slow, To seize occasion, unalert in war, And therefore brave in vain. In such belief Secure at night he laid him down to sleep, Nor dreamt that these disparaged enemies With drum and trumpet should in martial charge Sound his reveille. All day their march severe They held through wind and drenching rain; all night The autumnal tempest unabating raged, While in their comfortless and open camp They cheer'd themselves with patient hope: the storm Was their ally, and moving in the mist, When morning open'd, on the astonish'd foe They burst. Soon routed horse and foot, the French On all sides scattering, fled, on every side Beset, and every where pursued, with loss Of half their numbers captured, their whole stores, And all their gathered plunder. 'Twas a day Of surest omen, such as fill'd with joy True English hearts... No happier peals have e'er Been roll'd abroad from town and village tower Than gladden'd then with their exultant sound Salopian vales; and flowing cups were brimm'd All round the Wrekin to Sir Rowland's name. XXXVII. WRITTEN IN AN UNPUBLISHED VOLUME OF LETTERS AND MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS, BY BARRÉ CHARLES ROBERTS. Not often hath the cold insensate earth Closed over such fair hopes, as when the grave Received young Barré's perishable part; Nor death destroyed so sweet a dream of life. Nature, who sometimes lavisheth her gifts With fatal bounty, had conferred on him Even such endowments as parental love Might in its wisest prayer have ask'd of Heaven; An intellect that, choosing for itself The better part, went forth into the fields Of knowledge, and with never-sated thirst Drank of the living springs; a judgement calm And clear; a heart affectionate; a soul Within whose quiet sphere, no vanities Or low desires had place. Nor were the seeds Of excellence thus largely given, and left To struggle with impediment of clime Austere, or niggard soil; all circumstance Of happy fortune was to him vouchsafed; His way of life was as through garden-walks Wherein no thorns are seen, save such as grow, Types of our human state, with fruits and flowers. In all things favoured thus auspiciously, But in his father most. An intercourse So beautiful no former record shows In such relationship displayed, where through Familiar friendship's perfect confidence, The father's ever-watchful tenderness Meets ever in the son's entire respect Its due return devout, and playful love Mingles with every thing, and sheds o'er all A sunshine of its own. Should we then say The parents purchased at too dear a cost This deep delight, the deepest, purest joy Which Heaven hath here assign'd us, when they saw Their child of hope, just in the May of life, Beneath a slow and cankering malady, With irremediable decay consumed, Sink to the untimely grave? Oh, think not thus! Nor deem that such long anguish, and the grief Which in the inmost soul doth strike its roots There to abide through time, can overweigh The blessings which have been, and yet shall be! Think not that He in Whom we live, doth mock Our dearest aspirations! Think not love, Genius, and virtue should inhere alone In mere mortality, and Earth put out The sparks which are of Heaven! We are not left In darkness, nor devoid of hope. The Light Of Faith hath risen to us: the vanquish'd Grave To us the great consolatory truth Proclaim'd that He who wounds will heal; and Death Opening the gates of Immortality, The spirits whom it hath dissevered here, In everlasting union re-unite. Keswick, 1814. XXXVIII. EPITAPH. Time and the world, whose magnitude and weight Bear on us in this Now, and hold us here To earth enthrall'd, . . what are they in the Past? And in the prospect of the immortal Soul How poor a speck! Not here her resting-place, Her portion is not here; and happiest they Who, gathering early all that Earth can give, Shake off its mortal coil, and speed for Heaven. Such fate had he whose relics moulder here. Few were his years, but yet enough to teach Love, duty, generous feelings, high desires, Faith, hope, devotion: and what more could length Of days have brought him? What, but vanity, Joys frailer even than health or human life; Temptation, sin and sorrow, both too sure, Evils that wound, and cares that fret the heart. Repine not, therefore, ye who love the dead. XXXIX. EPITAPH. Some there will be to whom, as here they read, While yet these lines are from the chisel sharp, The name of Clement Francis, will recall His countenance benign; and some who knew What stores of knowledge and what humble thoughts, What wise desires, what cheerful piety, In happy union form'd the character Which faithfully impress'd his aspect meek. And others too there are, who in their hearts Will bear the memory of his worth enshrined, For tender and for reverential thoughts, When grief hath had its course, a life-long theme, A little while, and these, who to the truth Of this poor tributary strain could bear Their witness, will themselves have past away, And this cold marble monument present Words which can then within no living mind Create the ideal form they once evoked; This, then, the sole memorial of the dead. So be it. Only that which was of earth Hath perish'd; only that which was infirm, Mortal, corruptible, and brought with it The seed connate of death. A place in Time Is given us, only that we may prepare Our portion for Eternity: the Soul Possesseth there what treasures for itself, Wise to salvation, it laid up in Heaven. O Man, take thou this lesson from the Grave! There too all true affections shall revive, To fade no more; all losses be restored, All griefs be heal'd, all holy hopes fulfill'd. INSCRIPTIONS FOR THE CALEDONIAN CANAL. XL. 1. AT CLACHNACHARRY. Athwart the island here, from sea to sea, Between these mountain barriers, the Great Glen Of Scotland offers to the traveller, Through wilds impervious else, an easy path, Along the shore of rivers and of lakes, In line continuous, whence the waters flow Dividing east and west. Thus had they held For untold centuries their perpetual course Unprofited, till in the Georgian age This mighty work was plann'd, which should unite The lakes, control the innavigable streams, And through the bowels of the land deduce A way, where vessels which must else have braved The formidable Cape, and have essayed The perils of the Hyperborean Sea, Might from the Baltic to the Atlantic deep Pass and repass at will. So when the storm Careers abroad, may they securely here, Through birchen groves, green fields, and pastoral hills, Pursue their voyage home. Humanity May boast this proud expenditure, begun By Britain in a time of arduous war; Through all the efforts and emergencies Of that long strife continued, and achieved After her triumph, even at the time When national burdens bearing on the state Were felt with heaviest pressure. Such expense Is best economy. In growing wealth, Comfort, and spreading industry, behold The fruits immediate! And, in days to come, Fitly shall this great British work be named With whatsoe'er of most magnificence For public use, Rome in her plenitude Of power effected, or all-glorious Greece, Or Egypt, mother-land of all the arts. XLI. 2. AT FORT AUGUSTUS. Thou who hast reach d this level where the glede, Wheeling between the mountains in mid air, Eastward or westward as his gyre inclines, Descries the German or the Atlantic Sea, Pause here; and, as thou seest the ship pursue Her easy way serene, call thou to mind By what exertions of victorious art The way was open'd. Fourteen times upheaved, The vessel hath ascended, since she changed The salt sea water for the highland lymph; As oft in imperceptible descent Must, step by step, be lower'd, before she woo The ocean breeze again. Thou hast beheld What basins, most capacious of their kind, Enclose her, while the obedient element Lifts or depones its burthen. Thou hast seen The torrent hurrying from its native hills Pass underneath the broad canal inhumed, Then issue harmless thence; the rivulet Admitted by its intake peaceably, Forthwith by gentle overfall discharged: And haply too thou hast observed the herds Frequent their vaulted path, unconscious they That the wide waters on the long low arch Above them, lie sustained. What other works Science, audacious in emprize, hath wrought, Meet not the eye, but well may fill the mind. Not from the bowels of the land alone, From lake and stream hath their diluvial wreck Been scoop'd to form this navigable way; Huge rivers were controll'd, or from their course Shoulder'd aside; and at the eastern mouth, Where the salt ooze denied a resting place, There were the deep foundations laid, by weight On weight immersed, and pile on pile down-driven, Till steadfast as the everlasting rocks, The massive outwork stands. Contemplate now What days and nights of thought, what years of toil, What inexhaustive springs of public wealth The vast design required; the immediate good, The future benefit progressive still; And thou wilt pay thy tribute of due praise To those whose counsels, whose decrees, whose care, For after ages formed the generous work. XLII. 3. AT BANAVIE. Where these capacious basins, by the laws Of the subjacent element receive The ship, descending or upraised, eight times, From stage to stage with unfelt agency Translated; fitliest may the marble here Record the Architect's immortal name. Telford it was, by whose presiding mind The whole great work was plann'd and perfected; Telford, who o'er the vale of Cambrian Dee, Aloft in air, at giddy height upborne, Carried his navigable road, and hung High o'er Menaï's straits the bending bridge; Structures of more ambitious enterprize Than minstrels in the age of old romance To their own Merlin's magic lore ascribed. Nor hath he for his native land perform'd Less in this proud design; and where his piers Around her coast from many a fisher's creek Unshelter'd else, and many an ample port, Repel the assailing storm; and where his roads In beautiful and sinuous line far seen, Wind with the vale, and win the long ascent, Now o'er the deep morass sustain d, and now Across ravine, or glen, or estuary, Opening a passage through the wilds subdued. XLIII. EPITAPH IN BUTLEIGH CHURCH. Divided far by death were they, whose names In honour here united, as in birth, This monumental verse records. They drew In Dorset's healthy vales their natal breath, And from these shores beheld the ocean first, Whereon in early youth, with one accord They chose their way of fortune; to that course By Hood and Bridport's bright example drawn, Their kinsmen, children of this place, and sons Of one, who in his faithful ministry Inculcated within these hallowed walls The truths in mercy to mankind reveal'd. Worthy were these three brethren each to add New honours to the already honour'd name But Arthur, in the morning of his day, Perish'd amid the Caribbean sea, When the Pomona, by a hurricane Whirl'd, riven and overwhelmed, with all her crew Into the deep went down. A longer date To Alexander was assign'd, for hope, For fair ambition, and for fond regret, Alas, how short! for duty, for desert, Sufficing; and, while Time preserves the roll Of Britain's naval feats, for good report. A boy, with Cook he rounded the great globe; A youth, in many a celebrated fight With Rodney had his part; and having reach'd Life's middle stage, engaging ship to ship, When the French Hercules, a gallant foe, Struck to the British Mars his three-striped flag, He fell, in the moment of his victory. Here his remains in sure and certain hope Are laid, until the hour when Earth and Sea Shall render up their dead. One brother yet Survived, with Keppel and with Rodney train'd In battles, with the Lord of Nile approved, Ere in command he worthily upheld Old England's high prerogative. In the east, The west, the Baltic and the Midland seas, Yea, wheresoever hostile fleets have plough'd The ensanguined deep, his thunders have been heard, His flag in brave defiance hath been seen; And bravest enemies at Sir Samuel's name Felt fatal presage in their inmost heart, Of unavertible defeat foredoom'd. Thus in the path of glory he rode on, Victorious alway, adding praise to praise; Till full of honours, not of years, beneath The venom of the infected clime he sunk, On Coromandel's coast, completing there His service, only when his life was spent. To the three brethren, Alexander's son (Sole scion he in whom their line survived), With English feeling, and the deeper sense Of filial duty, consecrates this tomb. XLIV. EPITAPH. To Butler's venerable memory By private gratitude for public worth This monument is raised, here where twelve years Meekly the blameless Prelate exercised His pastoral charge; and whither, though removed A little while to Durham's wider See, His mortal relics were conveyed to rest. Born in dissent, and in the school of schism Bred, he withstood the withering influence Of that unwholesome nurture. To the Church, In strength of mind mature and judgement clear, A convert, in sincerity of heart Seeking the truth, deliberately convinced, And finding there the truth he sought, he came. In honour must his high desert be held While there is any virtue, any praise; For he it was whose gifted intellect First apprehended, and developed first The analogy connate, which in its course And constitution Nature manifests To the Creator's word and will divine; And in the depth of that great argument Laying his firm foundation, built thereon Proofs never to be shaken of the truths Reveal'd from Heaven in mercy to mankind; Allying thus Philosophy with Faith, And finding in things seen and known, the type And evidence of those within the veil. XLV. DEDICATION OF THE AUTHOR'S COLLOQUIES ON THE PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS OF SOCIETY. TO THE MEMORY OF THE REVEREND HERBERT HILL, Formerly Student of Christ Church, Oxford: successively Chaplain to the British Factories at Porto and at Lisbon; and late Rector of Streatham; who was released from this life, Sept. 19. 1828, in the 80th year of his age. Not upon marble or sepulchral brass Have I the record of thy worth inscribed, Dear Uncle! nor from Chantrey's chisel ask'd A monumental statue, which might wear Through many an age thy venerable form. Such tribute, were I rich in this world's wealth, Should rightfully be rendered, in discharge Of grateful duty, to the world evinced When testifying so by outward sign Its deep and inmost sense. But what I can Is rendered piously, prefixing here Thy perfect lineaments, two centuries Before thy birth by Holbein's happy hand Prefigured thus. It is the portraiture Of More, the mild, the learned, and the good; Traced in that better stage of human life, When vain imaginations, troublous thoughts, And hopes and fears have had their course, and left The intellect composed, the heart at rest, Nor yet decay hath touch'd our mortal frame. Such was the man whom Henry, of desert Appreciant alway, chose for highest trust; Whom England in that eminence approved; Whom Europe honoured, and Erasmus loved. Such was he ere heart-hardening bigotry Obscured his spirit, made him with himself Discordant, and contracting then his brow, With sour defeature marr'd his countenance. What he was, in his best and happiest time, Even such wert thou, dear Uncle! such thy look Benign and thoughtful; such thy placid mien; Thine eye serene, significant and strong, Bright in its quietness, yet brightening oft With quick emotion of benevolence, Or flash of active fancy, and that mirth Which aye with sober wisdom well accords. Nor ever did true Nature, with more nice Exactitude, fit to the inner man The fleshly mould, than when she stampt on thine Her best credentials, and bestow'd on thee An aspect, to whose sure benignity Beasts with instinctive confidence could trust, Which at a glance obtain'd respect from men, And won at once good will from all the good. Such as in semblance, such in word and deed Lisbon beheld him, when for many a year The even tenour of his spotless life Adorn'd the English Church, . . her minister In that strong hold of Rome's Idolatry, To God and man approved. What Englishman, Who in those peaceful days of Portugal Resorted thither, curious to observe Her cities, and the works and ways of men, But sought him, and from his abundant stores Of knowledge profited? What stricken one, Sent thither to protract a living death, Forlorn perhaps, and friendless else, but found A friend in him? What mourners, . . who had seen The object of their agonizing hopes In that sad cypress ground deposited Wherein so many a flower of British growth, Untimely faded and cut down, is laid, In foreign earth compress'd, . . but bore away A life-long sense of his compassionate care, His Christian goodness? Faithful shepherd he, And vigilant against the wolves, who there, If entrance might be won, would straight beset The dying stranger, and with merciless zeal Bay the death-bed. In every family Throughout his fold was he the welcome guest, Alike to every generation dear, The children's favourite, and the grandsire's friend; Tried, trusted and beloved. So liberal too In secret alms, even to his utmost means, That they who served him, and who saw in part The channels where his constant bounty ran, Maugre their own uncharitable faith, Believed him, for his works, secure of Heaven. It would have been a grief for me to think The features, which so perfectly express'd That excellent mind, should irretrievably From earth have past away, existing now Only in some few faithful memories Insoul'd, and not by any limner's skill To be imbodied thence. A blessing then On him, in whose prophetic counterfeit Preserved, the children now, who were the crown Of his old age, may see their father's face, Here to the very life pourtray'd, as when Spain's mountain passes, and her ilex woods, And fragrant wildernesses, side by side, With him I traversed, in my morn of youth, And gather'd knowledge from his full discourse. Often in former years I pointed out, Well-pleased, the casual portrait, which so well Assorted in all points; and haply since, While lingering o'er this meditative work, Sometimes that likeness, not unconsciously, Hath tinged the strain; and therefore, for the sake Of this resemblance, are these volumes now Thus to his memory properly inscribed. O friend! O more than father! whom I found Forbearing alway, alway kind; to whom No gratitude can speak the debt I owe; Far on their earthly pilgrimage advanced Are they who knew thee when we drew the breath Of that delicious clime! The most are gone; And whoso yet survive of those who then Were in their summer season, on the tree Of life hang here and there like wintry leaves, Which the first breeze will from the bough bring down. I, too, am in the sear, the yellow leaf. And yet, (no wish is nearer to my heart,) One arduous labour more, as unto thee In duty bound, full fain would I complete, (So Heaven permit,) recording faithfully The heroic rise, the glories, the decline, Of that fallen country, dear to us, wherein The better portion of thy days was past; And, where, in fruitful intercourse with thee, My intellectual life received betimes The bias it hath kept. Poor Portugal, In us thou harbouredst no ungrateful guests! We loved thee well; Mother magnanimous Of mighty intellects and faithful hearts, . . For such in other times thou wert, nor yet To be despair'd of, for not yet, methinks, Degenerate wholly, . . yes, we loved thee well! And in thy moving story, (so but life Be given me to mature the gathered store Of thirty years,) poet and politick, And Christian sage, (only philosopher Who from the Well of living water drinks Never to thirst again,) shall find, I ween, For fancy, and for profitable thought, Abundant food. Alas! should this be given, Such consummation of my work will now Be but a mournful close, the one being gone, Whom to have satisfied was still to me A pure reward, outweighing far all breath Of public praise. O friend revered, O guide And fellow-labourer in this ample field, How large a portion of myself hath past With thee, from earth to Heaven! . . Thus they who reach Grey hairs die piecemeal. But in good old age Thou hast departed; not to be bewail'd, . . Oh no! The promise on the Mount vouchsafed, Nor abrogate by any later law Reveal'd to man, . . that promise, as by thee Full piously deserved, was faithfully In thee fulfill'd, and in the land thy days Were long. I would not, as I saw thee last, For a king's ransom, have detain'd thee here, . . Bent, like the antique sculptor's limbless trunk, By chronic pain, yet with thine eye unquench'd, The ear undimm'd, the mind retentive still, The heart unchanged, the intellectual lamp Burning in its corporeal sepulchre. No; not if human wishes had had power To have suspended Nature's constant work, Would they who loved thee have detain'd thee thus, Waiting for death. That trance is over. Thou Art enter'd on thy heavenly heritage; And I, whose dial of mortality Points to the eleventh hour, shall follow soon. Meantime, with dutiful and patient hope, I labour that our names conjoin'd may long Survive, in honour one day to be held Where old Lisboa from her hills o'erlooks Expanded Tagus, with its populous shores And pine woods, to Palmella's crested height: Nor there alone; but in those rising realms Where now the offsets of the Lusian tree Push forth their vigorous shoots, . . from central plains, Whence rivers flow divergent, to the gulph Southward, where wild Parana disembogues A sea-like stream; and northward, in a world Of forests, where huge Orellana clips His thousand islands with his thousand arms. CARMEN TRIUMPHALE, FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE YEAR 1814. Illi justitiam confirmavere triumphi, Præsentes docuere Deos. Claudian. I. In happy hour doth he receive The Laurel, meed of famous Bards of yore, Which Dryden and diviner Spenser wore, . . In happy hour, and well may he rejoice, Whose earliest task must be To raise the exultant hymn for victory, And join a nation's joy with harp and voice, Pouring the strain of triumph on the wind, Glory to God, his song, Deliverance for Mankind! II. Wake, lute and harp! My soul take up the strain! Glory to God! Deliverance for Mankind! Joy... for all Nations, joy! But most for thee, Who hast so nobly fill'd thy part assign'd, O England! O my glorious native land! For thou in evil days didst stand Against leagued Europe all in arms array'd, Single and undismay'd, Thy hope in Heaven and in thine own right hand. Now are thy virtuous efforts overpaid, Thy generous counsels now their guerdon find, Glory to God! Deliverance for Mankind! III. Dread was the strife, for mighty was the foe Who sought with his whole strength thy overthrow. The Nations bow'd before him; some in war Subdued, some yielding to superior art; Submiss, they follow'd his victorious car. Their Kings, like Satraps, waited round his throne; For Britain's ruin and their own, By force or fraud in monstrous league combined. Alone, in that disastrous hour, Britain stood firm and braved his power; Alone she fought the battles of mankind. IV. O virtue which, above all former fame, Exalts her venerable name! O joy of joys for every British breast! That with that mighty peril full in view, The Queen of Ocean to herself was true! That no weak heart, no abject mind possess'd Her counsels, to abase her lofty crest, . . (Then had she sunk in everlasting shame,) But ready still to succour the oppress'd, Her Red Cross floated on the waves unfurl'd, Offering Redemption to the groaning world. V. First from his trance the heroic Spaniard woke; His chains he broke, And casting off his neck the treacherous yoke, He call'd on England, on his generous foe: For well he knew that wheresoe'er Wise policy prevail'd, or brave despair, Thither would Britain's liberal succours flow, Her arm be present there. Then, too, regenerate Portugal display'd Her ancient virtue, dormant all-too-long. Rising against intolerable wrong, On England, on her old ally, for aid The faithful nation call'd in her distress: And well that old ally the call obey'd, Well was that faithful friendship then repaid. VI. Say from thy trophied field how well, Vimeiro! Rocky Douro tell! And thou, Busaco, on whose sacred height The astonished Carmelite, While those unwonted thunders shook his cell, Join'd with his prayers the fervour of the fight. Bear witness those Old Towers, where many a da Waiting with foresight calm the fitting hour, The Wellesley, gathering strength in wise delay, Defied the Tyrant's undivided power. Swore not the boastful Frenchman in his might, Into the sea to drive his Island-foe? Tagus and Zezere, in secret night, Ye saw that host of ruffians take their flight! And in the Sun's broad light Onoro's Springs beheld their overthrow. VII. Patient of loss, profuse of life, Meantime had Spain endured the strife; And though she saw her cities yield, Her armies scatter'd in the field, Her strongest bulwarks fall; The danger undismay'd she view'd, Knowing that nought could e'er appal The Spaniards' fortitude. What though the Tyrant, drunk with power, Might vaunt himself, in impious hour, Lord and Disposer of this earthly ball? Her cause is just, and Heaven is over all. VIII. Therefore no thought of fear debased Her judgement, nor her acts disgraced. To every ill, but not to shame resign'd, All sufferings, all calamities she bore. She bade the people call to mind Their heroes of the days of yore, Pelayo and the Campeador, With all who once in battle strong, Lived still in story and in song. Against the Moor, age after age, Their stubborn warfare did they wage; Age after age, from sire to son, The hallowed sword was handed down; Nor did they from that warfare cease, And sheathe that hallowed sword in peace, Until the work was done. IX. Thus, in the famous days of yore, Their fathers triumph'd o'er the Moor. They gloried in his overthrow, But touch'd not with reproach his gallant name; For fairly, and with hostile aim profest, The Moor had rear'd his haughty crest, An open, honourable foe; But as a friend the treacherous Frenchman came, And Spain received him as a guest. Think what your fathers were! she cried, Think what ye are, in sufferings tried; And think of what your sons must be.. Even as ye make them.. slaves or free! X. Strains such as these from Spain's three seas, And from the farthest Pyrenees, Rung through the region. Vengeance was the word One impulse to all hearts at once was given; From every voice the sacred cry was heard, And borne abroad by all the winds of Heaven. Heaven too, to whom the Spaniards look'd for aid, A spirit equal to the hour bestow'd; And gloriously the debt they paid, Which to their valiant ancestors they owed; And gloriously against the power of France Maintain'd their children's proud inheritance. Their steady purpose no defeat could move, No horrors could abate their constant mind; Hope had its source and resting place above, And they, to loss of all on earth resign'd, Suffer'd, to save their country, and mankind. What strain heroic might suffice to tell, How Zaragoza stood, and how she fell? Ne'er since yon sun began his daily round, Was higher virtue, holier valour, found. Than on that consecrated ground. XI. Alone the noble Nation stood, When from Coruña, in the main, The star of England set in blood. Ere long on Talavera's plain, That star resplendent rose again; And though that day was doom'd to be A day of frustrate victory, Not vainly bled the brave; For French and Spaniard there might see That England's arm was strong to save; Fair promise there the Wellesley gave, And well in sight of Earth and Heaven, Did he redeem the pledge which there was given. XII. Lord of Conquest, heir of Fame, From rescued Portugal he came. Rodrigo's walls in vain oppose; In vain thy bulwarks, Badajoz; And Salamanca's heights proclaim The Conqueror's praise, the Wellesley's name. Oh, had the sun stood still that hour, When Marmont and his broken power Fled from their field of shame! Spain felt through all her realms the electric blow Cadiz in peace expands her gates again; And Betis, who to bondage long resign'd, Flow'd mournfully along the silent plain, Into her joyful bosom unconfined, Receives once more the treasures of the main. XIII. What now shall check the Wellesley, when at length Onward he goes, rejoicing in his strength? From Douro, from Castille's extended plain, The foe, a numerous band, Retire; amid the heights which overhang Dark Ebro's bed, they think to make their stand. He reads their purpose, and prevents their speed; And still as they recede, Impetuously he presses on their way; Till by Vittoria's walls they stood at bay, And drew their battle up in fair array. XIV. Vain their array, their valour vain: There did the practised Frenchman find A master arm, a master mind! Behold his veteran army driven Like dust before the breath of Heaven, Like leaves before the autumnal wind! Now, Britain, now thy brow with laurels bind; Raise now the song of joy for rescued Spain! And Europe, take thou up the awakening strain.. Glory to God! Deliverance for mankind! XV. From Spain the living spark went forth: The flame hath caught, the flame is spread! It warms, . . it fires the farthest North. Behold! the awaken'd Moscovite Meets the Tyrant in his might; The Brandenburg, at Freedom's call, Rises more glorious from his fall; And Frederic, best and greatest of the name, Treads in the path of duty and of fame. See Austria from her painful trance awake! The breath of God goes forth, . . the dry bones shake! Up Germany! . . with all thy nations rise! Land of the virtuous and the wise, No longer let that free, that mighty mind. Endure its shame! She rose as from the dead, She broke her chains upon the oppressor's head.. Glory to God! Deliverance for Mankind! XVI. Open thy gates, O Hanover! display Thy loyal banners to the day; Receive thy old illustrious line once more! Beneath an Upstart's yoke opprest, Long hath it been thy fortune to deplore That line, whose fostering and paternal sway So many an age thy grateful children blest. The yoke is broken now: . . A mightier hand Hath dash'd, . . in pieces dash'd, . . the iron rod. To meet her Princes, the deliver'd land Pours her rejoicing multitudes abroad; The happy bells, from every town and tower, Roll their glad peals upon the joyful wind; And from all hearts and tongues, with one consent, The high thanksgiving strain to heaven is sent, . . Glory to God! Deliverance for Mankind! XVII. Egmont and Horn, heard ye that holy cry, Martyrs of Freedom, from your seats in Heaven? And William the Deliverer, doth thine eye Regard from yon empyreal realm the land For which thy blood was given? What ills hath that poor Country suffer'd long! Deceived, despised, and plunder'd, and oppress'd, Mockery and insult aggravating wrong! Severely she her errors hath atoned, And long in anguish groan'd, Wearing the patient semblance of despair, While fervent curses rose with every prayer, In mercy Heaven at length its ear inclined; The avenging armies of the North draw nigh, Joy for the injured Hollander! . . the cry Of Orange rends the sky! All hearts are now in one good cause combined, . Once more that flag triumphant floats on high, . . Glory to God! Deliverance for Mankind! XVIII. When shall the Dove go forth? Oh when Shall Peace return among the Sons of Men? Hasten benignant Heaven the blessed day! Justice must go before, And Retribution must make plain the way; Force must be crushed by Force, The power of Evil by the power of Good, Ere Order bless the suffering world once more, Or Peace return again. Hold then right on in your auspicious course, Ye Princes, and ye People, hold right on! Your task not yet is done: Pursue the blow, . . ye know your foe, . . Complete the happy work so well begun. Hold on, and be your aim with all your strength Loudly proclaim'd and steadily pursued; So shall this fatal Tyranny at length Before the arms of Freedom fall subdued. Then, when the waters of the flood abate, The Dove her resting-place secure may find: And France restored, and shaking off her chain, Shall join the Avengers in the joyful strain, Glory to God! Deliverance for Mankind! ODES. ODE, WRITTEN DURING THE NEGOCIATIONS WITH BUONAPARTE, IN JANUARY, 1814. 1. Who counsels peace at this momentous hour, When God hath given deliverance to the oppress'd, And to the injured power? Who counsels peace, when Vengeance like a flood Rolls on, no longer now to be repress'd; When innocent blood From the four corners of the world cries out For justice upon one accursed head; When Freedom hath her holy banners spread Over all nations, now in one just cause United; when with one sublime accord Europe throws off the yoke abhorr'd, And Loyalty and Faith and Ancient Laws Follow the avenging sword! 2. Woe, woe to England! woe and endless shame, If this heroic land, False to her feelings and unspotted fame, Hold out the olive to the Tyrant's hand! Woe to the world, if Buonaparte's throne Be suffer'd still to stand! For by what names shall Right and Wrong be known, . . What new and courtly phrases must we feign For Falsehood, Murder, and all monstrous crimes, If that perfidious Corsican maintain Still his detested reign, And France, who yearns even now to break her chain, Beneath his iron rule be left to groan? No! by the innumerable dead, Whose blood hath for his lust of power been shed, Death only can for his foul deeds atone; That peace which Death and Judgement can bestow, That peace be Buonaparte's, . . that alone! 3. For sooner shall the Ethiop change his skin, Or from the Leopard shall her spots depart, Than this man change his old flagitious heart. Have ye not seen him in the balance weigh'd, And there found wanting? On the stage of blood Foremost the resolute adventurer stood; And when, by many a battle won, He placed upon his brow the crown, Curbing delirious France beneath his sway, Then, like Octavius in old time, Fair name might he have handed down, Effacing many a stain of former crime. Fool! should he cast away that bright renown! Fool! the redemption proffer'd should he lose! When Heaven such grace vouchsafed him that the way To Good and Evil lay Before him, which to choose. 4. But Evil was his Good, For all too long in blood had he been nurst, And ne'er was earth with verier tyrant curst. Bold man and bad, Remorseless, godless, full of fraud and lies, And black with murders and with perjuries, Himself in Hell's whole panoply he clad; No law but his own headstrong will he knew, No counsellor but his own wicked heart. From evil thus portentous strength he drew, And trampled under foot all human ties, All holy laws, all natural charities. 5. O France! beneath this fierce Barbarian's sway Disgraced thou art to all succeeding times; Rapine, and blood, and fire have mark'd thy way, All loathsome, all unutterable crimes. A curse is on thee, France! from far and wide It hath gone up to Heaven. All lands have cried For vengeance upon thy detested head! All nations curse thee, France! for wheresoe'er In peace or war thy banner hath been spread, All forms of human woe have follow'd there. The Living and the Dead Cry out alike against thee! They who bear, Crouching beneath its weight, thine iron yoke, Join in the bitterness of secret prayer The voice of that innumerable throng, Whose slaughter'd spirits day and night invoke The Everlasting Judge of right and wrong, How long, O Lord! Holy and Just, how long! 6. A merciless oppressor hast thou been, Thyself remorselessly oppress'd meantime; Greedy of war, when all that thou couldst gain Was but to dye thy soul with deeper crime, And rivet faster round thyself the chain. O blind to honour, and to interest blind, When thus in abject servitude resign'd To this barbarian upstart, thou couldst brave God's justice, and the heart of human kind! Madly thou thoughtest to enslave the world, Thyself the while a miserable slave. Behold the flag of vengeance is unfurl'd! The dreadful armies of the North advance; While England, Portugal, and Spain combined, Give their triumphant banners to the wind, And stand victorious in the fields of France. 7. One man hath been for ten long wretched years The cause of all this blood and all these tears; One man in this most aweful point of time Draws on thy danger, as he caused thy crime. Wait not too long the event, For now whole Europe comes against thee bent, His wiles and their own strength the nations know: Wise from past wrongs, on future peace intent, The People and the Princes, with one mind, From all parts move against the general foe: One act of justice, one atoning blow, One execrable head laid low, Even yet, O France! averts thy punishment. Open thine eyes! too long hast thou been blind; Take vengeance for thyself, and for mankind! 8. France! if thou lovest thine ancient fame, Revenge thy sufferings and thy shame! By the bones which bleach on Jaffa's beach; By the blood which on Domingo's shore Hath clogg'd the carrion-birds with gore; By the flesh which gorged the wolves of Spain, Or stiffen'd on the snowy plain Of frozen Moscovy; By the bodies which lie all open to the sky, Tracking from Elbe to Rhine the Tyrant's flight; By the widow's and the orphan's cry; By the childless parent's misery; By the lives which he hath shed; By the ruin he hath spread; By the prayers which rise for curses on his head; Redeem, O France! thine ancient fame, Revenge thy sufferings and thy shame, Open thine eyes! . . too long hast thou been blind; Take vengeance for thyself, and for mankind! 9. By those horrors which the night Witness'd, when the torches' light To the assembled murderers show'd Where the blood of Condé flow'd; By thy murder'd Pichegru's fame; By murder'd Wright, . . an English name; By murder'd Palm's atrocious doom; By murder'd Hofer's martyrdom; Oh! by the virtuous blood thus vilely spilt, The Villain's own peculiar private guilt, Open thine eyes! too long hast thou been blind! Take vengeance for thyself and for mankind! Keswick. ODE, WRITTEN DURING THE WAR WITH A MERICA, 1814. 1. When shall the Island Queen of Ocean lay The thunderbolt aside, And, twining olives with her laurel crown, Rest in the Bower of Peace? 2. Not long may this unnatural strife endure Beyond the Atlantic deep; Not long may men, with vain ambition drunk, And insolent in wrong, Afflict with their misrule the indignant land Where Washington hath left His a weful memory A light for after times! Vile instruments of fallen Tyranny, In their own annals, by their countrymen, For lasting shame shall they be written down. Soon may the better Genius there prevail! Then will the Island Queen of Ocean lay The thunderbolt aside, And, twining olives with her laurel crown, Rest in the Bower of Peace. 3. But not in ignominious ease, Within the Bower of Peace supine, The Ocean Queen shall rest! Her other toils await, . . A holier warfare, . . nobler victories; And amaranthine wreaths, Which, when the laurel crown grows sere, Will live for ever green. 4. Hear me, O England! rightly may I claim Thy favourable audience, Queen of Isles, My Mother-land revered! For in the perilous hour, When weaker spirits stood aghast, And reptile tongues, to thy dishonour bold, Spit their dull venom on the public ear, My voice was heard, . . a voice of hope, Of confidence and joy, . . . Yea of such prophecy As Wisdom to her sons doth aye vouchsafe, When with pure heart and diligent desire They seek the fountain springs, And of the Ages past Take counsel reverently. 5. Nobly hast thou stood up Against the foulest Tyranny that ere, In elder or in later times, Hath outraged human kind. O glorious England! thou hast borne thyself Religiously and bravely in that strife; And happier victory hath blest thine arms Than, in the days of yore, Thine own Plantagenets achieved, Or Marlborough, wise in council as in field, Or Wolfe, heroic name. Now gird thyself for other war; Look round thee, and behold what ills, Remediable and yet unremedied, Afflict man's wretched race! Put on the panoply of faith! Bestir thyself against thine inward foes, Ignorance and Want, with all their brood Of miseries and of crimes. 6. Powerful thou art: imperial Rome, When in the Augustan age she closed The temple of the two-faced God, Could boast no power like thine. Less opulent was Spain, When Mexico her sumless riches sent To that proud monarchy; And Hayti's ransack'd caverns gave their gold; And from Potosi's recent veins The unabating stream of treasure flow'd. And blest art thou, above all nations blest, For thou art Freedom's own beloved Isle! The light of Science shines Conspicuous like a beacon on thy shores; Thy martyrs purchased at the stake Faith uncorrupt for thine inheritance; And by thine hearths Domestic Purity, Safe from the infection of a tainted age, Hath kept her sanctuaries. Yet, O dear England! powerful as thou art, And rich and wise and blest, Yet would I see thee, O my Mother-land! Mightier and wealthier, wiser, happier still! 7. For still doth Ignorance Maintain large empire here, Dark and unblest amid surrounding light; Even as within this favour'd spot, Earth's wonder and her pride, The traveller on his way Beholds with weary eye Bleak moorland, noxious fen, and lonely heath, In drear extension spread, Oh grief! that spirits of celestial seed, Whom ever-teeming Nature hath brought forth, With all the human faculties divine Of sense and soul endued, . . Disherited of knowledge and of bliss, Mere creatures of brute life, Should grope in darkness lost! 8. Must this reproach endure? Honour and praise to him The universal friend, The general benefactor of mankind; He who from Coromandel's shores His perfected discovery brought; He by whose generous toils This foul reproach ere long shall be effaced, This root of evil be eradicate! Yea, generations yet unborn Shall owe their weal to him, And future nations bless The honour'd name of Bell. 9. Now may that blessed edifice Of public good be rear'd Which holy Edward traced, The spotless Tudor, he whom Death Too early summon'd to his heavenly throne. For Brunswick's line was this great work reserved, For Brunswick's fated line; They who from papal darkness, and the thrall Of that worst bondage which doth hold The immortal spirit chain'd, Saved us in happy hour. Fitly for them was this great work reserved; So, Britain, shall thine aged monarch's wish Receive its due accomplishment, That wish which with the good, (Had he no other praise,) Through all succeeding times would rank his name, That all within his realms Might learn the Book, which all Who rightly learn shall live. 10. From public fountains the perennial stream Of public weal must flow. O England! wheresoe'er thy churches stand, There on that sacred ground, Where the rich harvest of mortality Is laid, as in a garner, treasured up, There plant the Tree of Knowledge! Water it With thy perpetual bounty! It shall spread Its branches o'er the venerable pile, Shield it against the storm, And bring forth fruits of life. 11. Train up thy children, England! in the ways Of righteousness, and feed them with the bread Of wholesome doctrine. Where hast thou thy mines But in their industry? Thy bulwarks where, but in their breasts? Thy might, but in their arms? Shall not their numbers therefore be thy wealth, Thy strength, thy power, thy safety, and thy pride? Oh grief then, grief and shame, If, in this flourishing land, There should be dwellings where the new-born babe Doth bring unto its parent's soul no joy! Where squalid Poverty Receives it at its birth, And on her wither'd knees Gives it the scanty food of discontent! 12. Queen of the Seas! enlarge thyself; Redundant as thou art of life and power, Be thou the hive of nations, And send thy swarms abroad! Send them like Greece of old, With arts and science to enrich The uncultivated earth; But with more precious gifts than Greece or Tyre Or elder Egypt, to the world bequeath'd; Just laws, and rightful polity, And, crowning all, the dearest boon of Heaven, Its word and will reveal'd. Queen of the Seas! enlarge The place of thy pavilion. Let them stretch The curtains of thine habitations forth; Spare not; but lengthen thou Thy cords, make strong thy stakes. 13. Queen of the Seas! enlarge thyself; Send thou thy swarms abroad! For in the years to come, Though centuries or millenniums intervene, Where'er thy progeny, Thy language, and thy spirit shall be found, . . If on Ontario's shores, Or late-explored Missouri's pastures wide, Or in that Austral world long sought, The many-isled Pacific, . . yea where waves, Now breaking over coral reefs, affright The venturous mariner, When islands shall have grown, and cities risen In cocoa groves embower'd; . . Where'er thy language lives, By whatsoever name the land be call'd, That land is English still, and there Thy influential spirit dwells and reigns. Thrones fall, and Dynasties are changed; Empires decay and sink Beneath their own unwieldy weight; Dominion passeth like a cloud away: The imperishable mind Survives all meaner things. 14. Train up thy children, England, in the ways Of righteousness, and feed them with the bread Of wholesome doctrine. Send thy swarms abroad! Send forth thy humanizing arts, Thy stirring enterprize, Thy liberal polity, thy Gospel light! Illume the dark idolater, Reclaim the savage! O thou Ocean Queen! Be these thy toils when thou hast laid The thunderbolt aside: He who hath blest thine arms Will bless thee in these holy works of Peace! Father! thy kingdom come, and as in Heaven Thy will be done on Earth! Keswick. CARMINA AULICA, WRITTEN IN 1814, ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE ALLIED SOVEREIGNS IN ENGLAND. ??? ???? ?? ??????, ????? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ?????? ??????. Pindar, Olymp. xiii. ODE TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE REGENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 1. Prince of the mighty Isle! Proud day for thee and for thy kingdoms this, When Britain round her spear The olive garland twines, by Victory won. 2. Rightly may'st thou rejoice, For in a day of darkness and of storms, An evil day, a day of woe, To thee the sceptre fell. The Continent was leagued, It's numbers wielded by one will, Against the mighty Isle; All shores were hostile to the Red Cross flag, All ports against it closed; Save where, behind their ramparts driven, The Spaniard, and the faithful Portugal, Each on the utmost limits of his land, Invincible of heart, Stood firm, and put their trust In their good cause and thee. 3. Such perils menaced from abroad; At home worse dangers compass'd thee, Where shallow counsellors, A weak but clamorous crew, Pester'd the land, and with their withering breath Poison'd the public ear. For peace the feeble raised their factious cry: Oh, madness, to resist The Invincible in arms! Seek the peace-garland from his dreadful hand! And at the Tyrant's feet They would have knelt to take The wreath of aconite for Britain's brow. Prince of the mighty Isle! Rightly may'st thou rejoice, For in the day of danger thou did'st turn From their vile counsels thine indignant heart; Rightly may'st thou rejoice, When Britain round her spear The olive-garland twines, by Victory won. 4. Rejoice, thou mighty Isle, Queen of the Seas! rejoice; Ring round, ye merry bells, Till every steeple rock, And the wide air grow giddy with your joy! Flow streamers to the breeze! And ye victorious banners to the sun Unroll the proud Red Cross! Now let the anvil rest; Shut up the loom, and open the school-doors, That young and old may with festivities Hallow for memory, through all after years, This memorable time: This memorable time, When Peace, long absent, long deplored, returns. Not as vile Faction would have brought her home, Her countenance for shame abased, In servile weeds array'd, Submission leading her, Fear, Sorrow, and Repentance following close; And War, scarce deigning to conceal Beneath the mantle's folds his armed plight, Dogging her steps with deadly eye intent, Sure of his victim, and in devilish joy Laughing behind the mask. 5. Not thus doth Peace return! . . A blessed visitant she comes, . . . Honour in his right hand Doth lead her like a bride; And Victory goes before; Hope, Safety, and Prosperity, and Strength, Come in her joyful train. Now let the churches ring With high thanksgiving songs, And the full organ pour It's swelling peals to Heaven, The while the grateful nation bless in prayer Their Warriors and their Statesmen and their Prince, Whose will, whose mind, whose arm Have thus with happy end their efforts crown'd. Prince of the mighty Isle, Rightly may'st thou rejoice, When Britain round her spear The olive-garland twines, by Victory won. 6. Enjoy thy triumph now, Prince of the mighty Isle! Enjoy the rich reward, so rightly due, When rescued nations, with one heart and voice, Thy counsels bless and thee. Thou on thine own Firm Island seest the while, As if the tales of old Romance Were but to typify these splendid days, Princes and Potentates, And Chiefs renown'd in arms, From their great enterprize achieved, In friendship and in joy collected here. 7. Rejoice, thou mighty Isle! Queen of the Seas! rejoice; For ne'er in elder nor in later times Have such illustrious guests Honour'd thy silver shores. No such assemblage shone in Edward's hall, Nor brighter triumphs graced his glorious reign. Prince of the mighty Isle, Proud day for thee and for thy kingdoms this! Rightly mayst thou rejoice, When Britain round her spear The olive-garland twines, by Victory won. 8. Yet in the pomp of these festivities One mournful thought will rise within thy mind, The thought of Him who sits In mental as in visual darkness lost. How had his heart been fill'd With deepest gratitude to Heaven, Had he beheld this day! O King of kings, and Lord of lords, Thou who hast visited thus heavily The anointed head, . . Oh! for one little interval, One precious hour, Remove the blindness from his soul, That he may know it all, And bless thee ere he die. 9. Thou also should'st have seen This harvest of thy hopes, Thou whom the guilty act Of a proud spirit overthrown, Sent to thine early grave in evil hour! Forget not him, my country, in thy joy; But let thy grateful hand With laurel garlands hang The tomb of Perceval. Virtuous, and firm, and wise, The Ark of Britain in her darkest day He steer'd through stormy seas; And long shall Britain hold his memory dear, And faithful History give His meed of lasting praise. 10. That earthly meed shall his compeers enjoy, Britain's true counsellors, Who see with just success their counsels crown'd. They have their triumph now, to him denied; Proud day for them is this! Prince of the mighty Isle! Proud day for them and thee, When Britain round her spear The olive-garland twines, by Victory won. ODE TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, ALEXANDER THE FIRST, EMPEROR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS. 1. Conqueror, Deliverer, Friend of human-kind! The free, the happy, Island welcomes thee; Thee from thy wasted realms, So signally revenged; From Prussia's rescued plains; From Dresden's field of slaughter, where the ball, Which struck Moreau's dear life, Was turn'd from thy more precious head aside; From Leipsic's dreadful day, From Elbe, and Rhine, and Seine, In thy career of conquest overpast; From the proud Capital Of haughty France subdued, Then to her rightful line of Kings restored; Thee, Alexander! thee, the Great, the Good, The Glorious, the Beneficent, the Just, Thee to her honour'd shores The mighty Island welcomes in her joy. 2. Sixscore full years have past, Since to these friendly shores Thy famous ancestor, Illustrious Peter came. Wise traveller he, who over Europe went, Marking the ways of men; That so to his dear country, which then rose Among the nations in uncultured strength, He might bear back the stores Of elder polity, Its sciences and arts. Little did then the industrious German think, . . The soft Italian, lapt in luxury, . . Helvetia's mountain sons, of freedom proud, . . The patient Hollander, Prosperous and warlike then, . . Little thought they that in that farthest North, From Peter's race should the Deliverer spring, Destined by Heaven to save Art, Learning, Industry, Beneath the bestial hoof of godless Might All trampled in the dust. As little did the French, Vaunting the power of their Great Monarch then (His schemes of wide ambition yet uncheck'd,) As little did they think, That from rude Moscovy the stone should come. To smite their huge Colossus, which bestrode The subject Continent; And from its feet of clay, Breaking the iron limbs and front of brass, Strew the rejoicing Nations with the wreck. 3. Roused as thou wert with insult and with wrong, Who should have blamed thee if, in high-wrought mood Of vengeance and the sense of injured power, Thou from the flames which laid The City of thy Fathers in the dust, Had'st bid a spark be brought, And borne it in thy tent, Religiously by night and day preserved, Till on Montmartre's height, When open to thine arms, Her last defence o'erthrown, The guilty city lay, Thou hadst call'd every Russian of thine host To light his flambeau at the sacred flame, And sent them through her streets, And wrapt her roofs and towers, Temples and palaces, Her wealth and boasted spoils, In one wide flood of fire, Making the hated Nation feel herself The miseries she had spread. 4. Who should have blamed the Conquer or for that deed? Yea, rather would not one exulting cry Have risen from Elbe to Nile, How is the Oppressor fallen! Moscow's re-rising walls Had rung with glad acclaim; Thanksgiving hymns had fill'd Tyrol's rejoicing vales: How is the Oppressor fallen! The Germans in their grass-grown marts had met To celebrate the deed; Holland's still waters had been starr'd With festive lights, reflected there From every house and hut, From every town and tower; The Iberian and the Lusian's injured realms, From all their mountain-holds, From all their ravaged fields, From cities sack'd, from violated fanes, And from the sanctuary of every heart, Had pour'd that pious strain, How is the Oppressor fallen! Righteous art thou, O Lord! Thou Zaragoza, from thy sepulchres Hadst join'd the hymn; and from thine ashes thou, Manresa, faithful still! The blood that calls for vengeance in thy streets, Madrid, and Porto thine, And that which from the beach Of Tarragona sent its cry to Heaven, Had rested then appeased. Orphans had clapt their hands, And widows would have wept exulting tears, And childless parents with a bitter joy Have blest the avenging deed. 5. But thou hadst seen enough Of horrors, . . amply hadst avenged mankind. Witness that dread retreat, When God and nature smote The Tyrant in his pride! No wider ruin overtook Sennacherib's impious host; Nor when the frantic Persian led His veterans to the Lybian sands; Nor when united Greece O'er the barbaric power that victory won Which Europe yet may bless. A fouler Tyrant cursed the groaning earth, . . A fearfuller destruction was dispensed. Victorious armies followed on his flight; On every side he met The Cossacks' dreadful spear; On every side he saw The injured nation rise, Invincible in arms. What myriads, victims of one wicked will, Spent their last breath in curses on his head, There where the soldiers' blood Froze in the festering wound; And nightly the cold moon Saw sinking thousands in the snow lie down, Whom there the morning found Stiff, as their icy bed. 6. Rear high the monument! In Moscow and in proud Petropolis, The brazen trophy build; Cannon on cannon piled, Till the huge column overtop your towers! From France the Tyrant brought These instruments of death To work your overthrow; He left them in his flight To form the eternal record of his own. Raise, Russia, with thy spoils, A nobler monument Than e'er imperial Rome Built in her plenitude of pride and power! Still, Alexander! on the banks of Seine, Thy noblest monument For future ages stands— Paris subdued and spared. 7. Conqueror, Deliverer, Friend of human-kind, The free, the happy Island welcomes thee! Thee, Alexander! thee, the Great, the Good, The Glorious, the Beneficent, the Just! Thee to her honour'd shores The mighty Island welcomes in her joy. ODE TO HIS MAJESTY, FREDERICK WILLIAM THE FOURTH, KING OF PRUSSIA. 1. Welcome to England, to the happy Isle, Brave Prince of gallant people! Welcome Thou, In adverse as in prosperous fortunes tried, Frederick, the well-beloved! Greatest and best of that illustrious name, Welcome to these free shores! In glory art thou come, Thy victory perfect, thy revenge complete. 2. Enough of sorrow hast thou known, Enough of evil hath thy realm endured, Oppress'd but not debased, When thine indignant soul, Long suffering, bore its weight of heaviest woe. But still, through that dark day Unsullied honour was thy counsellor; And Hope, that had its trust in Heaven, And in the heart of man Its strength, forsook thee not. Thou had'st thy faithful people's love, The sympathy of noble minds; And wistfully, as one Who through the weary night has long'd for day, Looks eastward for the dawn, So Germany to thee Thurn'd in her bondage her imploring eyes. 3. Oh, grief of griefs, that Germany, The wise, the virtuous land, The land of mighty minds, Should bend beneath the frothy Frenchman's yoke! Oh, grief of griefs, to think That she should groan in bonds, She who had blest all nations with her gifts! There had the light of Reformation risen, The light of Knowledge there was burning clear. Oh, grief, that her unhappy sons Should toil and bleed and die, To quench that sacred light, The wretched agents of a tyrant's will! How often hath their blood In his accursed cause Reek'd on the Spaniard's blade! Their mangled bodies fed The wolves and eagles of the Pyrenees; Or stiffening in the snows of Moscovy, Amid the ashes of the watch-fire lay, Where dragging painfully their frozen limbs, With life's last effort, in the flames they fell. 4. Long, Frederick, did'st thou bear Her sorrows and thine own; Seven miserable years In patience did'st thou feed thy heart with hope; Till, when the arm of God Smote the blaspheming Tyrant in his pride, And Alexander with the voice of power Raised the glad cry, Deliverance for Mankind, First of the Germans, Prussia broke her chains. 5. Joy, joy for Germany, For Europe, for the World, When Prussia rose in arms! Oh, what a spectacle For present and for future times was there, When for the public need Wives gave their marriage rings, And mothers, when their sons The Band of Vengeance join'd, Bade them return victorious from the field, Or with their country fall. 6. Twice o'er the field of death The trembling scales of Fate hung equipoised: For France, obsequious to her Tyrant still, Mighty for evil, put forth all her power; And still beneath his hateful banners driven, Against their father-land Unwilling Germans bore unnatural arms. What though the Boaster made his temples ring With vain thanksgivings for each doubtful day, . . What though with false pretence of peace His old insidious arts he tried, . . The spell was broken! Austria threw her sword Into the inclining scale, And Leipsic saw the wrongs Of Germany avenged. 7. Ne'er till that aweful time had Europe seen Such multitudes in arms; Nor ever had the rising Sun beheld Such mighty interests of mankind at stake; Nor o'er so wide a scene Of slaughter e'er had Night her curtain closed. There, on the battle-field, With one accord the grateful monarchs knelt, And raised their voice to Heaven; “The cause was thine, O Lord! “O Lord! thy hand was here!” What Conquerors e'er deserved So proud, so pure a joy! It was a moment when the exalted soul Might almost wish to burst its mortal bounds, Lest all of life to come Vapid and void should seem After that high-wrought hour. 8. But thou hadst yet more toils, More duties and more triumphs yet in store. Elbe must not bound thine arms, Nor on the banks of Rhine Thine eagles check their flight, When o'er that barrier stream, Awakened Germany Drove her invaders with such rout and wreck As overtook the impious Gaul of old, Laden with plunder, and from Delphi driven. 9. Long had insulting France Boasted her arms invincible, Her soil inviolate; At length the hour of retribution comes! Avenging nations on all sides move on; In Gascony the flag of England flies, Triumphant, as of yore, When sable Edward led his peerless host. Behold the Spaniard and the Portugal, For cities burnt, for violated fanes, For murders, massacres, All monstrous, all unutterable crimes, Demanding vengeance with victorious cries, Pour from the Pyrenees. The Russian comes, his eye on Paris fix'd, The flames of Moscow present to his heart; The Austrian to efface Ulm, Austerlitz, and Wagram's later shame; Rejoicing Germany With all her nations swells the avenging train And in the field and in the triumph first, Thy banner, Frederick, floats. 10. Six weeks in daily strife The veteran Blucher bore the brunt of war. Glorious old man, The last and greatest of his master's school, Long may he live to hear The people bless his name! Late be it ere the wreath That crowns his silver hair Adorn his monument! Glorious old man, How oft hath he discomfited The boasted chiefs of France, And foil'd her vaunting Tyrant's desperate rage! Glorious old man, Who from Silesia's fields, O'er Elbe, and Rhine, and Seine, From victory to victory marching on, Made his heroic way; till at the gates Of Paris, open'd by his arms, he saw His King triumphant stand. 11. Bear back the sword of Frederick now! The sword which France amid her spoils display'd, Proud trophy of a day ignobly won. With laurels wreathe the sword; Bear it in triumph back, Thus gloriously regain'd; And when thou lay'st it in its honour'd place, O Frederick, well-beloved, Greatest and best of that illustrious name, Lay by its side thine own, A holier relic there! 12. Frederick, the well beloved! Welcome to these free shores, To England welcome, to the happy Isle! In glory art thou come, Thy victory perfect, thy revenge complete. ODE. THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS. 1 One day of dreadful occupation more, Ere England's gallant ships Shall, of their beauty, pomp, and power disrobed, Like sea-birds on the sunny main, Rock idly in the port. 2 One day of dreadful occupation more! A work of righteousness, Yea, of sublimest mercy, must be done; England will break the oppressor's chain, And set the captives free. 3 Red cross of England, which all shores have seen Triumphantly displayed, Thou sacred banner of the glorious Isle, Known wheresoever keel hath cut The navigable deep; 4 Ne'er didst thou float more proudly o'er the storm Of havoc and of death, Than when, resisting fiercely, but in vain, Algiers, her moony standard lowered, And sign'd the conqueror's law. 5 Oh, if the grave were sentient, as these Moors In erring credence hold; And if the victims of captivity Could in the silent tomb have heard The thunder of the fight; 6 Sure their rejoicing dust upon that day Had heaved the oppressive soil, And earth been shaken like the mosques and towers, When England on those guilty walls Her fiery vengeance sent. 7 Seldom hath victory given a joy like this,— When the delivered slave Revisits once again his own dear home, And tells of all his sufferings past, And blesses Exmouth's name. 8 Far, far and wide along the Italian shores, That holy joy extends; Sardinian mothers pay their vows fulfill'd; And hymns are heard beside thy banks, O Fountain Arethuse! 9 Churches shall blaze with lights, and ring with praise, And deeper strains shall rise From many an overflowing heart to Heaven; Nor will they in their prayers forget The hand that set them free. Keswick. ODE ON THE DEATH OF QUEEN CHARLOTTE. 1 Death has gone up into our Palaces! The light of day once more Hath visited the last abode Of mortal royalty, The dark and silent vault. 2 But not as when the silence of that valut Was interrupted last Doth England raise her loud lament, Like one by sudden grief Surprised and overcome. 3 Then with a passionate sorrow we bewail'd Youth on the untimely bier; And hopes which seem'd like flower-buds full, Just opening to the sun, For ever swept away. 4 The heart then struggled with repining thoughts, With feelings that almost Arraign'd the inscrutable decree, Embittered by a sense Of that which might have been. 5 This grief hath no repining; all is well, What hath been, and what is. The Angel of Deliverance came To one who full of years A waited her release. 6 All that our fathers in their prayers desired, When first their chosen Queen Set on our shores her happy feet, All by indulgent Heaven Had largely been vouchsafed. 7 At Court the Household Virtues had their place; Domestic Purity Maintain'd her proper influence there: The marriage bed was blest, And length of days was given. 8 No cause for sorrow then, but thankfulness; Life's business well perform'd, When weary age full willingly Resigns itself to sleep, In sure and certain hope! 9 Oh end to be desired, whene'er, as now, Good works have gone before, The seasonable fruit of Faith; And good Report, and good Example have survived. 10 Her left hand knew not of the ample alms Which her right hand had done; And therefore in the aweful hour, The promises were hers To secret bounty made. 11 With more than royal honours to the tomb Her bier is borne; with more Than Pomp can claim, or Power bestow; With blessings and with prayers From many a grateful heart. 12 Long, long then shall Queen Charlotte's name be dear; And future Queens to her As to their best examplar look; Who imitates her best May best deserve our love. Keswick, 1818. ODE FOR ST. GEORGE'S DAY. 1. Wild were the tales which fabling monks of old Devised to swell their hero's holy fame, When in the noble army they enroll'd St. George's doubtful name. Of arrows and of spears they told Which fell rebated from his mortal mould; And how the burning fiery furnace blast To him came tempered like a summer breeze, When at the hour of evening it hath past O'er gurgling tanks, and groves of lemon trees. And how the reverential flame Condensing like a garb of honour, play'd In gorgeous folds around his glorious frame; And how the Heathen in their frantic strife With water then alike in vain, essay'd His inextinguishable life. 2. What marvel if the Christian Knight Thus for his dear Redeemer's sake Defied the purpled Pagan's might? Such boldness well might he partake, For he beside the Libyan lake Silene, with the Infernal King Had coped in actual fight. The old Dragon on terrific wing Assail'd him there with Stygian sting And arrowy tongue, and potent breath Exhaling pestilence and death. Dauntless in faith the Champion stood, Opposed against the rage of Hell The Red-Cross shield, and wielding well His sword, the strife pursued; First with a wide and rending wound Brought the maim'd monster to the ground, Then pressing with victorious heel Upon his scaly neck subdued, Plunged and replunged the searching steel; Till from the shameful overthrow Howling the incarnate Demon fled, And left that form untenanted, And hid in Hell his humbled head, Still trembling in the realm below, At thought of that tremendous foe. 3. Such tales monastic fablers taught; Their kindred strain the minstrels caught; A web of finer texture they Wrought in the rich romantic lay; Of magic caves and woods they sung, Where Kalyb nursed the boy divine, And how those woods and caverns rung With cries from many a demon tongue, When breaking from the witch's cell, He bound her in her own strong spell. And of the bowers of Ormandine Where thrall'd by art, St. David lay Sleeping inglorious years away, Till our St. George, with happier arm Released him, and dissolved the charm. But most the minstrels loved to tell Of that portentous day, When Sabra at the stake was bound, Her brow with sweetest garlands crown'd The Egyptian Dragon's prey; And how for her the English Knight, Invincible at such a sight, Engaged that fiendish beast in fight, And o'er the monster, triple-scaled, The good sword Askalon prevail'd. 4. Such legends monks and minstrels feign'd, And easily the wondrous tales obtain'd, In those dark days, belief; Shrines to the Saint were rear'd, and temples rose And states and kingdoms for their patron chose The Cappadocian Chief. Full soon his sainted name hath won In fields of war a wide renown; Spain saw the Moors confounded fly, Before the well known slaughter cry, St. George for Aragon! And when the Catalans pursued Their vengeful way with fire and blood, The Turk and treacherous Greek were dearly taught That all-appalling shout, For them with rage and ruin fraught In many a dolorous rout. 'Twas in this heavenly Guardian's trusted strength, That Malta's old heroic knights defied The Ottoman in all his power and pride. Repulsed from her immortal walls at length The baffled Misbeliever turn'd with shame; And when in after years in dreams he heard That all-too-well remembered battle-word, Woke starting at St. George's dreadful name, And felt cold sweats of fear suffuse his trembling frame. 5. But thou, O England! to that sainted name Hast given its proudest praise, its loftiest fame. Witness the field of Cressy, on that day, When vollying thunders roll'd unheard on high, For in that memorable fray, Broken, confused, and scatter'd in dismay, France had ears only for the Conqueror's cry, St. George, St. George for England! St. George and Victory! Bear witness Poictiers! where again the foe From that same hand received his overthrow. In vain essay'd, Mont Joye St. Denis rang From many a boastful tongue, And many a hopeful heart in onset brave; Their courage in the shock of battle quail'd His dread response, when sable Edward gave, And England and St. George again prevail'd. Bear witness Agincourt, where once again The bannered lilies on the ensanguin'd plain Were trampled by the fierce pursuers' feet; And France, doom'd ever to defeat Against that foe, beheld her myriads fly Before the withering cry, St. George, St. George for England! St. George and Victory! 6. That cry in many a field of Fame Through glorious ages held its high renown; Nor less hath Britain proved the sacred name Auspicious to her crown. Troubled too oft her course of fortune ran, Till when the Georges came Her happiest age began. Beneath their just and liberal sway, Old feuds and factions dired away; One feeling through her realms was known, One interest of the Nation and the Throne. Ring, then, ye bells upon St. George's Day, From every tower in glad accordance ring; And let all instruments full, strong, or sweet, With touch of modulated string, And soft or swelling breath, and sonorous beat, The happy name repeat, While heart and voice their joyous tribute bring And speak the People's love for George their King. Keswick, 1820. ODE WRITTEN AFTER THE KING'S VISIT TO IRELAND. 1. How long, O Ireland, from thy guilty ground Shall innocent blood Arraign the inefficient arm of Power? How long shall Murder there, Leading his banded ruffians through the land, Range unrepress'd? How long shall Night Bring to thy harmless dwellers, in the stead Of natural rest, the feverish sleep of fear, Midnight alarms, Horrible dreams, and worse realities? How long shall darkness cover, and the eye Of Morning open upon deeds of death? 2. In vain art thou by liberal Nature's dower Exuberantly blest; The Seasons in their course Shed o'er thy hills and vales The bounties of a genial clime, in vain; Heaven hath in vain bestowed Well-tempered liberty, (Its last and largest boon to social man,) If the brute Multitude from age to age, Wild as their savage ancestors, Go irreclaim'd the while, From sire to son transmitting still In undisturb'd descent, (A sad inheritance!) Their errors, and their crimes. 3. Green Island of the West! Thy Sister Kingdom fear'd not this When thine exultant shores Rung far and wide of late, And grateful Dublin first beheld her King, First of thy Sovereigns he Who visited thy shores in peace and joy. 4. Oh what a joy was there! In loud huzzahs prolong'd, Surge after surge the tide Of popular welcome rose; And in the intervals alone Of that tumultuous sound of glad acclaim, Could the deep cannon's voice Of duteous gratulation, though it spake In thunder, reach the ear. From every tower the merry bells rung round, Peal hurrying upon peal, Till with the still reverberating din The walls and solid pavement seem'd to shake, And every bosom with the tremulous air Inhaled a dizzy joy. 5. Age that came forth to gaze, That memorable day Felt in its quicken'd veins a pulse like youth; And lisping babes were taught to bless their King; And grandsires bade the children treasure up The precious sight, for it would be a tale The which in their old age Would make their children's children gather round Intent, all ears to hear. 6. Were then the feelings of that generous time Ephemeral as the joy? Pass'd they away like summer clouds, Like dreams of infancy, Like glories of the evening firmament, Which fade, and leave no trace? Merciful Heaven, oh let not thou the hope Be frustrate, that our Sister Isle may reap From the good seed then sown Full harvests of prosperity and peace; That perfect union may derive its date From that auspicious day, And equitable ages thence Their lasting course begin; 7. Green Island of the West, While frantic violence delays That happier order, still must thou remain In thine own baleful darkness wrapt; As if the Eye divine, That which beholdeth all, from thee alone In wrath had turn'd away! 8. But not for ever thus shalt thou endure, To thy reproach, and ours, Thy misery, and our shame! For Mercy shall go forth To stablish Order, with an arm'd right hand; And firm Authority With its all-present strength controul the bad And with its all-sufficient shield Protect the innocent: The first great duty this of lawful Power Which holds its delegated right from Heaven. 9. The first great duty this; but this not all; For more than comes within the scope Of Power, is needed here; More than to watch insidious discontent, Curb, and keep curb'd the treasonable tongue, And quell the madden'd multitude: Labours of love remain; To weed out noxious customs rooted deep In a rank soil, and long left seeding there; Pour balm into old wounds, and bind them up: Remove remediable ills, Improve the willing mind, And win the generous heart. Afflicted Country, from thyself Must this redemption come; And thou hast children able to perform This work of faith and hope. 10. O for a voice that might recall To their deserted hearths Thy truant sons! a voice Whose virtuous cogency Might with the strength of duty reach their souls; A strength that should compel entire consent, And to their glad obedience give The impulse and the force of free good-will! For who but they can knit The severed links of that appointed chain, Which when in just cohesion it unites Order to order, rank to rank, In mutual benefit, So binding heart to heart, It then connecteth Earth with Heaven, from whence The golden links depend. 11. Nor when the war is waged With Error, and the brood Of Darkness, will your aid Be wanting in the cause of Light and Love, Ye Ministers of that most holy Church Whose firm foundations on the rock Of Scripture rest secure! What though the Romanist in numbers strong, In misdirected zeal And bigotry's blind force, Assail your Fortress; though the sons of Schism Join in insane alliance with that old Inveterate enemy, Weening thereby to wreak Their covenanted hatred, and effect Your utter overthrow; What though the unbelieving crew, For fouler purpose aid the unnatural league; And Faction's wolfish pack Set up their fiercest yell, to augment The uproar of assault; Clad in your panoply will ye be found, Wielding the spear of Reason, with the sword Of Scripture girt; and from your shield of Truth Such radiance shall go forth, As when, unable to sustain its beams On Arthur's arm unveil'd, Earth-born Orgoglio reel'd, as if with wine; And from her many-headed beast cast down Duessa fell, her cup of sorcery spilt, Her three-crown'd mitre in the dust devolved, And all her secret filthiness exposed. 12. O thou fair Island, with thy Sister Isle Indissolubly link'd for weal and woe; Partaker of her present power, Her everlasting fame; Dear pledges hast thou render'd and received Of that eternal union! Bedell's grave Is in thy keeping; and with thee Deposited, doth Taylor's holy dust A wait the Archangel's call. O land profuse of genius and of worth, Largely hast thou received, and largely given! 13. Green Island of the West, The example of unspotted Ormond's faith To thee we owe; to thee Boyle's venerable name: Berkeley the wise, the good: And that great Orator who first Unmask'd the harlot sorceress Anarchy, What time, in Freedom's borrowed form profaned, She to the nations round Her draught of witchcraft gave: And him who in the field O'erthrow her giant offspring in his strength, And brake the iron rod. Proud of such debt, Rich to be thus indebted, these, Fair Island, Sister Queen Of Ocean, Ireland, these to thee we owe. 14. Shall I then imprecate A curse on them that would divide Our union? . . Far be this from me, O Lord! Far be it! What is man, That he should scatter curses? . . King of Kings, Father of all, Almighty, Governor Of all things! unto Thee Humbly I offer up our holier prayer! I pray Thee, not in wrath But in thy mercy, to confound These men's devices. Lord! Lighten their darkness with thy Gospel light, And thus abate their pride, Assuage their malice thus! Keswick, 1821. ODE WRITTEN AFTER THE KING'S VISIT TO SCOTLAND. 1. At length hath Scotland seen The presence long desired; The pomp of royalty Hath gladden'd once again Her ancient palace, desolate how long! From all parts far and near, Highland and lowland, glen and fertile carse, The silent mountain lake, the busy port, Her populous cities, and her pastoral hills, In generous joy convened By the free impulse of the loyal heart Her sons have gather'd, and beheld their King. 2. Land of the loyal, as in happy hour Revisited, so was thy regal seat In happy hour for thee Forsaken, under favouring stars, when James His valediction gave, And great Eliza's throne Received its rightful heir, The Peaceful and the Just. 3. A more auspicious union never Earth From eldest days had seen, Than when, their mutual wrongs forgiven, And gallant enmity renounced With honour, as in honour foster'd long, The ancient Kingdoms formed Their everlasting league. 4. Slowly by time matured A happier order then for Scotland rose; And where inhuman force, And rapine unrestrain'd Had lorded o'er the land, Peace came, and polity, And quiet industry, and frugal wealth; And there the household virtues fix'd Their sojourn undisturb'd. 5. Such blessings for her dowry Scotland drew From that benignant union; nor less large The portion that she brought. She brought security and strength, True hearts, and strenuous hands, and noble minds. Say, Ocean, from the shores of Camperdown, What Caledonia brought! Say thou, Egypt! Let India tell! And let tell Victory From that Brabantine field, The proudest field of fame! 6. Speak ye, too, Works of peace; For ye too have a voice Which shall be heard by ages! The proud Bridge, Through whose broad arches, worthy of their name And place, his rising and his refluent tide Majestic Thames, the royal river rolls; And that which high in air A bending line suspended, shall o'erhang Menai's straits, as if By Merlin's mighty magic there sustain'd; And Pont-Cyssylté, not less wondrous work; Where on gigantic columns raised Aloft, a dizzying height, The laden barge pursues its even way, While o'er his rocky channel the dark Dee Hurries below, a raging stream, scarce heard. And that huge mole, whose deep foundations, firm As if by Nature laid, Repel the assailing billows, and protect The British fleet, securely riding there, Though southern storms possess the sea and sky, And from its depths commoved, Infuriate ocean raves. Ye stately monuments of Britain's power, Bear record ye what Scottish minds Have plann'd and perfected! With grateful wonder shall posterity See the stupendous works, and Rennie's name, And Telford's shall survive, till time Leave not a wreck of sublunary things. 7. Him too may I attest for Scotland's praise, Who seized and wielded first The mightiest element That lies within the scope of man's controul; Of evil and of good, Prolific spring, and dimly yet discern'd The immeasurable results. The mariner no longer seeks Wings from the wind; creating now the power Wherewith he wins his way, Right on across the ocean-flood he steers Against opposing skies; And reaching now the inmost continent, Up rapid streams, innavigable else, Ascends with steady progress, self-propell'd. 8. Nor hath the Sister kingdom borne In science and in arms Alone, her noble part; There is an empire which survives The wreck of thrones, the overthrow of realms, The downfall, and decay, and death Of Nations. Such an empire in the mind Of intellectual man Rome yet maintains, and elder Greece, and such By indefeasible right Hath Britain made her own. How fair a part doth Caledonia claim In that fair conquest! Whereso'er The British tongue may spread, (A goodly tree, whose leaf No winter e'er shall nip;) Earthly immortals, there, her sons of fame, Will have their heritage. In eastern and in occidental Ind; The new antarctic world, where sable swans Glide upon waters, call'd by British names, And plough'd by British keels; In vast America through all its length And breadth, from Massachusett's populous coast To western Oregan; And from the southern gulph, Where the great river with his turbid flood Stains the green Ocean, to the polar sea. 9. There nations yet unborn shall trace In Hume's perspicuous page, How Britain rose, and through what storms attain'd Her eminence of power. In other climates, youths and maidens there Shall learn from Thomson's verse in what attire The various seasons, bringing in their change Variety of good, Revisit their beloved English ground. There Beattie! in thy sweet and soothing strain Shall youthful poets read Their own emotions. There too, old and young, Gentle and simple, by Sir Walter's tales Spell-bound shall feel Imaginary hopes and fears Strong as realities, And waking from the dream, regret its close. 10. These Scotland are thy glories; and thy praise Is England's, even as her power And opulence of fame are thine. So hath our happy union made Each in the other's weal participant, Enriching, strengthening, glorifving both. 11. O House of Stuart, to thy memory still For this best benefit Should British hearts in gratitude be bound! A deeper tragedy Than thine unhappy tale hath never fill'd The historic page, nor given Poet or moralist his mournful theme. O House severely tried, And in prosperity alone Found wanting, Time hath closed Thy tragic story now! Errors, and virtues fatally betrayed, Magnanimous suffering, vice, Weakness, and head-strong zeal, sincere, tho' blind, Wrongs, calumnies, heart-wounds, Religious resignation, earthly hopes, Fears and affections, these have had their course, And over them in peace The all-ingulphing stream of years hath closed. But this good work endures, 'Stablish'd and perfected by length of days, The indissoluble union stands. 12. Nor hath the sceptre from that line Departed, though the name hath lost Its regal honours. Trunk and root have fail'd: A scion from the stock Liveth and flourisheth. It is the Tree Beneath whose sacred shade, In majesty and peaceful power serene, The Island Queen of Ocean hath her seat; Whose branches far and near Extend their sure protection; whose strong roots Are with the Isle's foundations inter-knit; Whose stately summit when the storm careers Below, abides unmoved, Safe in the sunshine and the peace of Heaven. Keswick, 1822. THE WARNING VOICE. ODE I. 1. Take up thy prophecy, Thou dweller in the mountains, who hast nursed Thy soul in solitude, Holding communion with immortal minds, Poets and Sages of the days of old; And with the sacred food Of meditation and of lore divine Hast fed thy heavenly part; Take up thy monitory strain, O son of song, a strain severe Of warning and of woe! 2. O Britain, O my Mother Isle, Ocean's imperial Queen, Thou glory of all lands! Is there a curse upon thee, that thy sons Would rush to ruin, drunk With sin, and in infuriate folly blind? Hath Hell enlarged itself, And are the Fiends let loose To work thine overthrow? 3. For who is she That on the many-headed Beast Triumphantly enthroned, Doth ride abroad in state, The Book of her Enchantments in her hand? Her robes are stain'd with blood, And on her brazen front Is written Blasphemy. 4. Know ye not then the Harlot? know ye not Her shameless forehead, her obdurate eye, Her meretricious mien, Her loose immodest garb with slaughter foul? Your Fathers knew her; when delirious France, Drunk with her witcheries, Upon the desecrated altar set The Sorceress, and with rites Inhuman and accurst, O'er all the groaning land Perform'd her sacrifice. 5. Your Fathers knew her! when the nations round Received her maddening spell, And call'd her Liberty, And in that name proclaim'd A jubilee for guilt; When their blaspheming hosts defied high Heaven, And wheresoe'er they went let havoc loose; Your Fathers knew the Sorceress! They stood firm And in that hour of trial faithful found, They raised the Red Cross flag. 6. They knew her; and they knew That not in scenes of rapine and of blood, In lawless riotry, And wallowing with the multitude obscene, Would Liberty be found! Her in her form divine, Her genuine form they knew; For Britain was her home, With Order and Religion there she dwelt; It was her chosen seat, Her own beloved Isle. Think not that Liberty From Order and Religion e'er will dwell Apart; companions they Of heavenly seed connate. 7. Woe, woe for Britain, woe! If that society divine, By lewd and impious uproar driven, Indignantly should leave The land that in their presence hath been blest! Woe, woe! for in her streets Should grey-hair'd Polity Be trampled under foot by ruffian force; And Murder to the noon-day sky Lift his red hands, as if no God were there War would lay waste the realm; Devouring fire consume Temples and Palaces; Nor would the lowliest cot Escape that indiscriminating storm, When Heaven upon the guilty nation pour'd The vials of its wrath. 8. These are no doubtful ills! The unerring voice of Time Warns us that what hath been again shall be; And the broad beacon-flame Of History, casts its light Upon Futurity. 9. Turn not thy face away, Almighty! from the realm By thee so highly favoured, and so long. Thou who in war hast been our shield and strength, From famine who hast saved us, and hast bade The Earthquake and the Pestilence go by, Spare us, O Father! save us from ourselves! From insane Faction, who prepares the pit In which itself would fall; From rabid Treason's rage, . . The poor priest-ridden Papist's erring zeal, . . The lurking Atheist's wiles, . . The mad Blasphemer's venom, . . from our foes, Our follies and our errors, and our sins, Save us, O Father! for thy mercy's sake, Thou who alone canst save! Keswick, 1819. ODE II. 1. In a vision I was seized, When the elements were hush'd In the stillness that is felt Ere the Storm goes abroad; Thro' the air I was borne away: And in spirit I beheld Where a City lay beneath, Like a valley mapp'd below, When seen from a mountain top. 2. The night had closed around, And o'er the sullen sky Were the wide wings of darkness spread, The City's myriad lamps Shone mistily below, Like stars in the bosom of a lake; And its murmurs arose Incessant and deep, Like the sound of the sea Where it rakes on a stoney shore. 3. A voice from the darkness went forth, “Son of Man, look below! This is the City to be visited; For as a fountain Casteth its waters, So casteth she her wickedness abroad!” Mine eyes were opened then, And the veil which conceals The Invisible World was withdrawn. 4. I look'd, and behold! As the Patriarch, in his dream, Saw the Angels to and fro Pass from Heaven to Earth, On their ministry of love; So saw I where a way From that great City, led To the black abyss of bale, To the dolorous region of Death. 5. Wide and beaten was the way, And deep the descent To the Adamantine Gates, Which were thrown on their hinges back. Wailing and Woe were within, And the gleam of sulphurous fires, In darkness and smoke involved. 6. And through those open gates The Fiends were swarming forth; Hastily, joyfully, As to a jubilee, The Spirits accurst were trooping up: They fill'd the streets, And they bore with them curses and plagues; And they scatter'd lies abroad, Horrors, obscenities, Blasphemies, treasons, And the seeds of strife and death. 7. “Son of Man, look up!” said the Voice. I look'd and beheld The way which Angels tread, Seen like a pillar of light That slants from a broken sky. That heavenly way by clouds was closed, Heavy, and thick, and dark, with thunder charged And there a Spirit stood, Who raised in menacing act his aweful arm; He spake aloud, and thrill'd My inmost soul with fear. 8. “Woe! Woe! Woe to the City where Faction reigns! Woe to the Land where Sedition prevails! Woe to the Nation whom Hell deceives! Woe! Woe! They have Eyes, and they will not see! They have Ears, and they will not hear! They have Hearts, and they will not feel! Woe to the People who fasten their eyes! Woe to the People who deafen their ears! Woe to the People who harden their hearts! Woe! Woe! The Vials are charged; The measure is full; The wrath is ripe; . . Woe! Woe!” 9. But from that City then, behold, A gracious form arose; Her snow-white wings upon the dusky air Shone like the waves that glow Around a midnight keel in liquid light. Upward her supplicating arms were spread And as her face to heaven In eloquent grief she raised, Loose, like a Comet's refluent tresses, hung Her heavenly hair dispersed. 10. “Not yet, O Lord! not yet, O merciful as just! Not yet!” . . the Tutelary Angel cried; “For I must plead with thee for this poor land, Guilty, . . but still the seat Of genuine piety, . . The mother still of noble minds, . . The nurse of high desires! Not yet, O Lord, not yet, Give thou thine anger way! Thou who hast set thy Bow Of Mercy in the clouds Not yet, O Lord, pour out The Vials of thy wrath! 11. “Oh, for the sake Of that religion pure and undefiled Here purchased by thy Martyrs' precious blood, . . Mercy, Oh mercy, Lord! For that well-order'd frame of equal laws, Time's goodliest monument, O'er which thy guardian shield So oft hath been extended heretofore, . . Mercy, Oh mercy, Lord! For the dear charities The household virtues, that in secret there, Like sweetest violets, send their fragrance forth, Mercy, Oh mercy, Lord! 12. “Oh wilt thou quench the light, That should illuminate The nations who in darkness sit, And in the shadow of death? . . Oh wilt thou stop the heart Of intellectual life? . . Wilt thou seel the eye of the world? . . Mercy, Oh mercy, Lord! 13. “Not for the guilty few; Nor for the erring multitude, The ignorant many, wickedly misled, . . Send thou thy vengeance down Upon a land so long the dear abode Of Freedom, Knowledge, Virtue, Faith, approved, . Thine own beloved land! Oh let not Hell prevail Against her past deserts, . . Against her actual worth.. Against her living hopes, . . Against the Prayers that rise From righteous hearts this hour! 14. “Plead with me, O ye Dead! whose sacred dust Is laid in hope within her hallow'd soil, Plead with me for your Country, suffering now Beneath such loathsome plagues, As ancient Egypt in her slime And hot corruption bred. Plead with me at this hour All wise and upright Minds, All honourable Hearts, . . For ye abhor the sins Which, o'er the guilty land, Have drawn this gather'd storm! Plead with me Souls unborn, Ye who are doomed upon this fateful spot To pass your pilgrimage, Earth's noblest heritors, Or children of a ruin'd realm, to shame And degradation born, . . (For this is on the issue of the hour!) Plead with me, unborn Spirits! that the wrath Deserved, may pass away! 15. “Join in my supplication, Seas and Lands, . . I call upon you all! Thou, Europe, in whose cause, Alone and undismay'd, The generous nation strove; For whose deliverance in the Spanish fields Her noblest blood was pour'd Profusely; and on that Brabantine plain, (The proudest fight that e'er By virtuous victory Was hallowed to all time.) Join, with me, Africa! For here hath thy redemption had its birth; . . Thou, India, who art blest With peace and equity Beneath her easy sway; . . And thou, America, who owest The large and inextinguishable debt Of filial love! . . And ye, Remote Antarctic Isles and Continent, Where the glad tidings of the Gospel truth, Her children are proclaiming faithfully; Join with me now to wrest The thunderbolt from that relenting arm! . . Plead with me, Earth and Ocean, at this hour, Thou, Ocean, for thy Queen, And for thy benefactress, thou, O Earth!” 16. The Angel ceased; The vision fled; The wind arose, The clouds were rent, They were drifted and scatter'd abroad; And as I look'd, and saw Where through the clear blue sky the silver Moon Moved in her light serene, A healing influence reach'd my heart, And I felt in my soul That the voice of the Angel was heard. Keswick, 1820. ODE ON THE PORTRAIT OF BISHOP HEBER. 1. Yes, . . such as these were Heber's lineaments; Such his capacious front, His comprehensive eye, His open brow serene. Such was the gentle countenance which bore Of generous feeling, and of golden truth, Sure Nature's sterling impress; never there Unruly passion left Its ominous marks infix'd, Nor the worse die of evil habit set An inward stain ingrain'd. Such were the lips whose salient playfulness Enliven'd peaceful hours of private life; Whose eloquence Held congregations open-ear'd, As from the heart it flow'd, a living stream Of Christian wisdom, pure and undefiled. 2. And what if there be those Who in the cabinet Of memory hold enshrined A livelier portraiture, And see in thought, as in their dreams, His actual image, verily produced; Yet shall this counterfeit convey To strangers, and preserve for after-time, All that could perish of him, . . all that else Even now had past away: For he hath taken with the Living Dead His honourable place, . . Yea, with the Saints of God His holy habitation. Hearts, to which Thro' ages he shall speak, Will yearn towards him; and they too, (for such Will be,) who gird their loins With truth to follow him, Having the breast-plate on of righteousness, The helmet of salvation, and the shield Of faith, . . they too will gaze Upon his effigy With reverential love, 'Till they shall grow familiar with its lines, And know him when they see his face in Heaven. 3. Ten years have held their course Since last I look'd upon That living countenance, When on Llangedwin's terraces we paced Together, to and fro. Partaking there its hospitality, We with its honoured master spent, Well-pleased, the social hours; His friend and mine, . . my earliest friend, whom I Have ever, thro' all changes, found the same, From boyhood to grey hairs, In goodness, and in worth and warmth of heart. Together then we traced The grass-grown site, where armed feet once trod The threshold of Glendower's embattled hall; Together sought Melangel's lonely Church, Saw the dark yews, majestic in decay, Which in their flourishing strength Cyveilioc might have seen; Letter by letter traced the lines On Yorwerth's fabled tomb; And curiously observed what vestiges, Mouldering and mutilate, Of Monacella's legend there are left, A tale humane, itself Well-nigh forgotten now: Together visited the ancient house Which from the hill-slope takes Its Cymric name euphonious; there to view, Tho' drawn by some rude limner inexpert, The faded portrait of that lady fair, Beside whose corpse her husband watch'd, And with perverted faith, Preposterously placed, Thought, obstinate in hopeless hope, to see The beautiful dead, by miracle, revive. 4. The sunny recollections of those days Full soon were overcast, when Heber went Where half this wide world's circle lay Between us interposed. A messenger of love he went, A true Evangelist; Not for ambition, nor for gain, Nor of constraint, save such as duty lays Upon the disciplin'd heart, Took he the overseeing on himself, Of that wide flock dispers'd, Which, till these latter times, Had there been left to stray Neglected all too long. For this great end devotedly he went, Forsaking friends and kin, His own loved paths of pleasantness and peace, Books, leisure, privacy, Prospects (and not remote), of all wherewith Authority could dignify desert; And, dearer far to him, Pursuits that with the learned and the wise Should have assured his name its lasting place. 5. Large, England, is the debt Thou owest to Heathendom To India most of all, where Providence, Giving thee thy dominion there in trust, Upholds its baseless strength. All seas have seen thy red-cross flag In war triumphantly display'd; Late only has thou set that standard up On pagan shores in peace! Yea, at this hour the cry of blood Riseth against thee from beneath the wheels Of that seven-headed Idol's car accurst; Against thee, from the widow's funeral pile The smoke of human sacrifice Ascends, even now, to Heaven 6. The debt shall be discharged; the crying sin Silenced; the foul offence For ever done away. Thither our saintly Heber went, In promise and in pledge That England, from her guilty torpor roused, Should zealously and wisely undertake Her aweful task assign'd: Thither, devoted to the work, he went, There spent his precious life, There left his holy dust. 7. How beautiful are the feet of him That bringeth good tidings, That publisheth peace, That bringeth good tidings of good, That proclaimeth salvation for men Where'er the Christian Patriarch went, Honour and reverence heralded his way, And blessings followed him. The Malabar, the Moor, the Cingalese, Tho' unillumed by faith, Yet not the less admired The virtue that they saw. The European soldier, there so long Of needful and consolatory rites Injuriously deprived, Felt, at his presence, the neglected seed Of early piety Refresh'd, as with a quickening dew from Heaven. Native believers wept for thankfulness, When on their heads he laid his hallowing hands: And, if the Saints in bliss Be cognizant of aught that passeth here, It was a joy for Schwartz To look from Paradise that hour Upon his earthly flock. 8 Ram boweth down, Creeshna and Seeva stoop; The Arabian Moon must wane to wax no more: And Ishmael's seed redeem'd, And Esau's.. to their brotherhood, And to their better birthright then restored, Shall within Israel's covenant be brought. Drop down, ye Heavens, from above! Ye Skies, pour righteousness! Open, thou Earth, and let Salvation be brought forth! And sing ye, O ye Heavens, and shout, O Earth, With all thy hills and vales, Thy mountains and thy woods, Break forth into a song, a jubilant song, For by Himself the Lord hath sworn That every tongue to Him shall swear, To Him that every knee shall bow. 9. Take comfort, then, my soul! Thy latter days on earth, Tho' few, shall not be evil, by this hope Supported, and enlighten'd on the way. O Reginald, one course, Our studies, and our thoughts, Our aspirations held, Wherein, but mostly in this blessed hope, We had a bond of union, closely knit In spirit, though in this world's wilderness Apart our lots were cast. Seldom we met; but I knew well That whatsoe'er this never-idle hand Sent forth would find with thee Benign acceptance, to its full desert. For thou wert of that audience, . . fit, though few, For whom I am content To live laborious days, Assured that after years will ratify Their honourable award. 10. Hadst thou revisited thy native land, Mortality and Time, And Change, must needs have made Our meeting mournful. Happy he Who to his rest is borne In sure and certain hope, Before the hand of age Hath chill'd his faculties, Or sorrow reach'd him in his heart of hearts! Most happy if he leave in his good name A light for those who follow him, And in his works a living seed Of good, prolific still. 11. Yes, to the Christian, to the Heathen world, Heber, thou art not dead, . . thou canst not die! Nor can I think of thee as lost. A little portion of this little isle At first divided us; then half the globe: The same earth held us still; but when, O Reginald, wert thou so near as now! 'Tis but the falling of a withered leaf, . . The breaking of a shell, . . The rending of a veil! Oh when that leaf shall fall, . . That shell be burst, . . that veil be rent, . . may then My spirit be with thine! Keswick, 1820. EPISTLE TO ALLAN CUNNINGHAM. Well, Heaven be thank'd! friend Allan, here I am, Once more to that dear dwelling place return'd, Where I have past the whole mid stage of life, Not idly, certes; not unworthily, . . So let me hope: where Time upon my head Hath laid his frore and monitory hand; And when this poor frail earthly tabernacle Shall be dissolved, . . it matters not how soon Or late, in God's good time, . . where I would fain Be gathered to my children, earth to earth. Needless it were to say how willingly I bade the huge metropolis farewell, Its din, and dust, and dirt, and smoke, and smut, Thames' water, paviours' ground, and London sky; Weary of hurried days and restless nights, Watchmen, whose office is to murder sleep When sleep might else have weigh'd ones eyelids down, Rattle of carriages, and roll of carts, And tramp of iron hoofs; and worse then all, . . Confusion being worse confounded then, With coachmen's quarrels and with footmen's shouts, My next-door neighbours, in a street not yet Macadamized, (me miserable!) at home; For then had we from midnight until morn House-quakes, street-thunders, and door-batteries. O Government! in thy wisdom and thy want, Tax knockers; . . in compassion to the sick, And those whose sober habits are not yet Inverted, topsy-turvying night and day, Tax them more heavily than thou hast charged Armorial bearings and bepowder'd pates. And thou, O Michael, ever to be praised, Angelic among Taylors! for thy laws Antifuliginous, extend those laws Till every chimney its own smoke consume, And give thenceforth thy dinners unlampoon'd. Escaping from all this, the very whirl Of mail-coach wheels bound outward from Lad-lane, Was peace and quietness. Three hundred miles Of homeward way seem'd to the body rest, And to the mind repose. Donne This poet begins his second Satire thus:— “Sir, though (I thank God for it) I do hate Perfectly all this town, yet there's one state In all ill things so excellently best, That hate towards them breeds pity towards the rest.” did not hate More perfectly that city. Not for all Its social, all its intellectual joys, . . Which having touch'd, I may not condescend To name aught else the Demon of the place Might for his lure hold forth; . . not even for these Would I forego gardens and green-field walks, And hedge-row trees, and stiles, and shady lanes, And orchards, were such ordinary scenes Alone to me accessible as those Wherein I learnt in infancy to love The sights and sounds of Nature; . . wholesome sights Gladdening the eye that they refresh; and sounds Which, when from life and happiness they spring, Bear with them to the yet unharden'd heart A sense that thrills its cords of sympathy; Or, when proceeding from insensate things, Give to tranquillity a voice wherewith To woo the ear and win the soul attuned; . . . Oh not for all that London might bestow, Would I renounce the genial influences And thoughts and feelings to be found where'er We breathe beneath the open sky, and see Earth's liberal bosom. Judge then by thyself, Allan, true child of Scotland, . . thou who art So oft in spirit on thy native hills, And yonder Solway shores, . . a poet thou, Judge by thyself how strong the ties which bind A poet to his home; when, . . making thus Large recompense for all that haply else Might seem perversely or unkindly done, . . Fortune hath set his happy habitacle Among the ancient hills, near mountain streams And lakes pellucid, in a land sublime And lovely as those regions of Romance Where his young fancy in its day-dreams roam'd, Expatiating in forests wild and wide, Loëgrian, or of dearest Faery-land. Yet, Allan, of the cup of social joy No man drinks freelier, nor with heartier thirst, Nor keener relish, where I see around Faces which I have known and loved so long, That when he prints a dream upon my brain Dan Morpheus takes them for his readiest types. And therefore in that loathed metropolis Time measured out to me some golden hours. They were not leaden-footed while the clay Beneath the patient touch of Chantrey's hand Grew to the semblance of my lineaments. Lit up in memory's landscape, like green spots Of sunshine, are the mornings, when in talk With him, and thee, and Bedford (my true friend Of forty years,) I saw the work proceed, Subject the while myself to no restraint, But pleasureably in frank discourse engaged: Pleased too, and with no unbecoming pride To think this countenance, such as it is, So oft by rascally mislikeness wrong'd, Should faithfully to those who in his works Have seen the inner man portray'd, be shown, And in enduring marble should partake Of our great sculptor's immortality. I have been libell'd, Allan, as thou knowest, Through all degrees of calumny; but they Who fix one's name for public sale beneath A set of features slanderously unlike, Are the worst libellers. Against the wrong Which they inflict Time hath no remedy. Injuries there are which Time redresseth best, Being more sure in judgment, though perhaps Slower in process even than the court Where justice, tortoise-footed and mole-eyed, Sleeps undisturb'd, fann'd by the lulling wings Of harpies at their prey. We soon live down Evil or good report, if undeserved. Let then the dogs of Faction bark and bay, Its bloodhounds, savaged by a cross of wolf, Its full-bred kennel from the Blatant-beast; And from my lady's gay varanda, let Her pamper'd lap-dog with his fetid breath In bold bravado join, and snap and growl, With petulant consequentialness elate, There in his imbecility at once Ridiculous and safe; though all give cry, Whiggery's sleek spaniels, and its lurchers lean, Its poodles by unlucky training marr'd, Mongrel and cur and bob-tail, let them yelp Till weariness and hoarseness shall at length Silence the noisy pack; meantime be sure I will not stoop for stones to cast among them. The foumarts and the skunks may be secure In their own scent; and for that viler swarm, The vermin of the press, both those that skip, And those that creep and crawl, I do not catch And pin them for exposure on the page, Their filth is their defence. But I appeal Against the limner's and the graver's wrong; Their evil works survive them. Bilderdijk, Whom I am privileged to call my friend, Suffering by graphic libels in likewise, Gave his wrath vent in verse. Would I could give The life and spirit of his vigorous Dutch, As his dear consort hath transfused my strains Into her native speech; and made them known On Rhine and Yssel, and rich Amstel's banks; And wheresoe'er the voice of Vondel still Is heard, and still Antonides and Hooft Are living agencies; and Father Cats, The household poet, teacheth in his songs The love of all things lovely, all things pure: Best poet, who delights the cheerful mind Of childhood, stores with moral strength the heart Of youth, with wisdom maketh mid-life rich, And fills with quiet tears the eyes of age. Hear then in English rhyme how Bilderdijk Describes his wicked portraits, one by one. “A madman who from Bedlam hath broke loose; And honest fellow of the numskull race; And pappyer-headed still, a very goose Staring with eyes aghast and vacant face; A Frenchman who would mirthfully display On some poor idiot his malicious wit; And lastly, one who, train'd up in the way Of worldly craft, hath not forsaken it, But hath served Mammon with his whole intent, A thing of Nature's worst materials made, Low-minded, stupid, base and insolent. I, . . I, . . a Poet, . . have been thus portray'd. Can ye believe that my true effigy Among these vile varieties is found? What thought, or line, or word, hath fallen from me In all my numerous works whereon to ground The opprobrious notion? Safely I may smile At these, acknowledging no likeness here. But worse is yet to come; so, soft awhile! For now in potter's earth must I appear, And in such workmanship, that, sooth to say, Humanity disowns the imitation, And the dolt image is not worth its clay. Then comes there one who will to admiration In plastic wax my perfect face present; And what of his performance comes at last? Folly itself in every lineament! Its consequential features overcast With the coxcombical and shallow laugh Of one who would, for condescension, hide, Yet in his best behaviour, can but half Suppress the scornfulness of empty pride.” “And who is Bilderdijk?” methinks thou sayest, A ready question; yet which, trust me, Allan, Would not be ask'd, had not the curse that came From Babel, clipt the wings of Poetry. Napoleon ask'd him once with cold fix'd look, “Art thou then in the world of letters known?” “I have deserved to be,” the Hollander Replied, meeting that proud imperial look With calm and proper confidence, and eye As little wont to turn away abash'd Before a mortal presence. He is one Who hath received upon his constant breast The sharpest arrows of adversity; Whom not the clamours of the multitude, Demanding in their madness and their might Iniquitous things, could shake in his firm mind; Nor the strong hand of instant tyranny, From the straight path of duty turn aside. But who in public troubles, in the wreck Of his own fortunes, in proscription, exile, Want, obloquy, ingratitude, neglect, And what severer trials Providence Sometimes inflicteth, chastening whom it loves, In all, thro' all, and over all, hath borne An equal heart, as resolute toward The world, as humbly and religiously Beneath his heavenly Father's rod resign'd. Right-minded, happy-minded, righteous man, True lover of his country and his kind; In knowledge, and in inexhaustive stores Of native genius rich; philosopher, Poet, and sage. The language of a State Inferior in illustrious deeds to none, But circumscribed by narrow bounds, and now Sinking in irrecoverable decline, Hath pent within its sphere a name wherewith Europe should else have rung from side to side. Such, Allan, is the Hollander to whom Esteem and admiration have attach'd My soul, not less than pre-consent of mind, And gratitude for benefits, when being A stranger, sick, and in a foreign land, He took me like a brother to his house, And ministered to me, and made a time Which had been wearisome and careful else, So pleasurable, that in my kalendar There are no whiter days. 'Twill be a joy For us to meet in Heaven, tho' we should look Upon each other's earthly face no more. ..This is this world's complexion! “cheerful thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind,” and these again Give place to calm content, and steadfast hope, And happy faith assured... Return we now, With such transition as our daily life Imposes in its wholesome discipline, To a lighter strain; and from the gallery Of the Dutch Poet's mis-resemblances Pass into mine; where I shall show thee, Allan, Such an array of villainous visages, That if among them all there were but one Which as a likeness could be proved upon me, It were enough to make me in mere shame Take up an alias, and forswear myself. Whom have we first? A dainty gentleman, His sleepy eyes half-closed, and countenance To no expression stronger than might suit A simper, capable of being moved: Sawney and sentimental; with an air So lack-thought and so lackadaisycal, You might suppose the volume in his hand Must needs be Zimmermann on Solitude. Then comes a jovial landlord, who hath made it Part of his trade to be the shoeing horn For his commercial customers. God Bacchus Hath not a thirstier votary. Many a pipe Of Porto's vintage hath contributed To give his cheeks that deep carmine engrain'd, And many a runlet of right Nantes, I ween, Hath suffered percolation thro' that trunk, Leaving behind it in the boozey eyes A swoln and red suffusion, glazed and dim. Our next is in the evangelical line, A leaden-visaged specimen; demure, Because he hath put on his Sunday's face; Dull by formation, by complexion sad, By bile, opinions, and dyspepsy sour. One of the sons of Jack, . . I know not which, For Jack hath a most numerous progeny, . . Made up for Mr. Colburn's Magazine This pleasant composite; a bust supplied The features; look, expression, character Are of the artist's fancy and free grace. Such was that fellow's birth and parentage. The rascal proved prolific; one of his breed, By Docteur Pichot introduced in France, Passes for Monsieur Sooté; and another, . . An uglier miscreant too, . . the brothers Schumann And their most cruel copper-scratcher Zschoch, From Zwickau sent abroad through Germany. I wish the Schumen and the copper-scratcher No worse misfortune for their recompence, Than to encounter such a cut-throat face In the Black Forest or the Odenwald. And now is there a third derivative From Mr. Colburn's composite, which late The Arch-Pirate Galignani hath prefix'd, A spurious portrait to a faithless life, And bearing lyingly the libell'd name Of Lawrence, impudently there insculpt. The bust that was the innocent forefather To all this base, abominable brood, I blame not, Allan. 'Twas the work of Smith, A modest, mild, ingenious man, and errs, Where erring, only because over-true, Too close a likeness for similitude; Fixing to every part and lineament Its separate character, and missing thus That which results from all. Sir Smug comes next; Allan, I own Sir Smug! I recognise That visage with its dull sobriety; I see it duly as the day returns, When at the looking-glass with lather'd chin And razor-weapon'd hand I sit, the face Composed and apprehensively intent Upon the necessary operation About to be perform'd, with touch, alas, Not always confident of hair-breadth skill. Even in such sober sadness and constrain'd Composure cold, the faithful Painter's eye Had fix'd me like a spell, and I could feel My features stiffen as he glanced upon them. And yet he was a man whom I loved dearly, My fellow-traveller, my familiar friend, My household guest. But when he look'd upon me, Anxious to exercise his excellent art, The countenance he knew so thoroughly Was gone, and in its stead there sate Sir Smug. Under the graver's hand, Sir Smug became Sir Smouch, . . a son of Abraham. Now albeit, Far rather would I trace my lineage thence Than with the oldest line of Peers or Kings Claim consanguinity, that cast of features Would ill accord with me, who in all forms Of pork, baked, roasted, toasted, boil'd or broil'd, Fresh, salted, pickled, seasoned, moist or dry, Whether ham, bacon, sausage, souse or brawn, Leg, bladebone, baldrib, griskin, chine, or chop, Profess myself a genuine Philopig. It was, however, as a Jew whose portion Had fallen unto him in a goodly land Of loans, of omnium, and of three per cents, That Messrs. Percy of the Anecdote-firm Presented me unto their customers. Poor Smouch endured a worse judaization Under another hand. In this next stage He is on trial at the Old Bailey, charged With dealing in base coin. That he is guilty No Judge or Jury could have half a doubt When they saw the culprit's face; and he himself, As you may plainly see, is comforted By thinking he has just contrived to keep Out of rope's reach, and will come off this time For transportation. Stand thou forth for trial, Now, William Darton, of the Society Of Friends called Quakers; thou who in 4th month Of the year 24, on Holborn Hill, At No. 58., didst wilfully, Falsely, and knowing it was falsely done, Publish upon a card, as Robert Southey's, A face which might be just as like Tom Fool's, Or John, or Richard Any-body-else's! What had I done to thee, thou William Darton, That thou shouldst for the lucre of base gain, Yea, for the sake of filthy fourpences, Palm on my countrymen that face for mine? O William Darton, let the Yearly Meeting Deal with thee for that falseness! All the rest Are traceable; Smug's Hebrew family; The German who might properly adorn A gibbet or a wheel, and Monsieur Sooté, Sons of Fitzbust the Evangelical; . . I recognize all these unlikenesses, Spurious abominations tho' they be, Each filiated on some original; But thou, Friend Darton, and.. observe me, man, Only in courtesy, and quasi Quaker, I call thee Friend! . . hadst no original; No likeness, or unlikeness, silhouette, Outline, or plaister, representing me, Whereon to form thy misrepresentation. If I guess rightly at the pedigree Of thy bad groatsworth, thou didst get a barber To personate my injured Laureateship; An advertising barber, . . one who keeps A bear, and when he puts to death poor Bruin Sells his grease, fresh as from the carcase cut, Pro bono publico, the price per pound Twelve shillings and no more. From such a barber, O unfriend Darton! was that portrait made I think, or peradventure from his block. Next comes a minion worthy to be set In a wooden frame; and here I might invoke Avenging Nemesis, if I did not feel Just now God Cynthius pluck me by the ear. But, Allan, in what shape God Cynthius comes, And wherefore he admonisheth me thus, Nor thou nor I will tell the world; hereafter The commentators, my Malones and Reids, May if they can. For in my gallery Though there remaineth undescribed good store, Yet “of enough enough, and now no more,” (As honest old George Gascoigne said of yore,) Save only a last couplet to express That I am always truly yours, R.S. The main subject of this epistle having been suggested by a poem of Bilderdijk's, part only of which I have incorporated, in a compressed and very inadequate translation, I annex here the original, in justice to my deceased friend,—a man of most extraordinary attainments, and genius not less remarkable. Keswick, August, 1828. END OF THE THIRD VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. THALABA THE DESTROYER. THE FIRST BOOK. Worse and worse, young Orphane, be thy payne, If thou due vengeance doe forbeare, Till guiltie blood her guerdon do obtayne. Faery Queen, B. 2. Can. 1. 1. How beautiful is night! A dewy freshness fills the silent air; No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain, Breaks the serene of heaven: In full-orb'd glory yonder Moon divine Rolls through the dark blue depths. Beneath her steady ray The desert-circle spreads, Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky. How beautiful is night! 2. Who at this untimely hour Wanders o'er the desert sands? No station is in view, Nor palm-grove, islanded amid the waste. The mother and her child, The widow'd mother and the fatherless boy, They at this untimely hour Wander o'er the desert sands. 3. Alas! the setting sun Saw Zeinab in her bliss, Hodeirah's wife beloved. Alas! the wife beloved, The fruitful mother late, Whom when the daughters of Arabia named, They wish'd their lot like her's, She wanders o'er the desert sands A wretched widow now; The fruitful mother of so fair a race, With only one preserved, She wanders o'er the wilderness. 4. No tear relieved the burthen of her heart; Stunn'd with the heavy woe, she felt like one Half-waken'd from a midnight dream of blood. But sometimes when the boy Would wet her hand with tears, And, looking up to her fix'd countenance, Sob out the name of Mother! then she groan'd. At length collecting, Zeinab turn'd her eyes To heaven, and praised the Lord; “He gave, he takes away!” The pious sufferer cried, “The Lord our God is good!” 5. “Good is He!” quoth the boy, “Why are my brethren and my sisters slain? Why is my father kill'd? Did ever we neglect our prayers, Or ever lift a hand unclean to Heaven? Did ever stranger from our tent Unwelcomed turn away? Mother, He is not good!” 6. Then Zeinab beat her breast in agony, “O God, forgive the child! He knows not what he says; Thou know'st I did not teach him thoughts like these; O Prophet, pardon him!” 7. She had not wept till that assuaging prayer,.. The fountains of her grief were open'd then, And tears relieved her heart. She raised her swimming eyes to Heaven, “Allah, thy will be done! Beneath the dispensations of that will I groan, but murmur not. A day will come, when all things that are dark Will be made clear;..then shall I know, O Lord! Why in thy mercy thou hast stricken me; Then see and understand what now My heart believes and feels.” 8. Young Thalaba in silence heard reproof; His brow in manly frowns was knit, With manly thoughts his heart was full. “Tell me who slew my father?” cried the boy. Zeinab replied and said, “I knew not that there lived thy father's foe. The blessings of the poor for him Went daily up to Heaven; In distant lands the traveller told his praise;.. I did not think there lived Hodeirah's enemy.” 9. “But I will hunt him through the world!” Young Thalaba exclaim'd. “Already I can bend my father's bow; Soon will my arm have strength To drive the arrow-feathers to his heart.” 10. Zeinab replied, “O Thalaba, my child, Thou lookest on to distant days, And we are in the desert, far from men!” 11. Not till that moment her afflicted heart Had leisure for the thought. She cast her eyes around, Alas! no tents were there Beside the bending sands, No palm-tree rose to spot the wilderness; The dark blue sky closed round, And rested like a dome Upon the circling waste. She cast her eyes around, Famine and Thirst were there; And then the wretched Mother bowed her head, And wept upon her child. 12. A sudden cry of wonder From Thalaba aroused her; She raised her head, and saw Where high in air a stately palace rose. Amid a grove embower'd Stood the prodigious pile; Trees of such ancient majesty Tower'd not on Yemen's happy hills, Nor crown'd the lofty brow of Lebanon: Fabric so vast, so lavishly enrich'd, For Idol, or for Tyrant, never yet Raised the slave race of man, In Rome, nor in the elder Babylon, Nor old Persepolis, Nor where the family of Greece Hymn'd Eleutherian Jove. 13. Here studding azure tablatures And ray'd with feeble light, Star-like the ruby and the diamond shone: Here on the golden towers The yellow moon-beam lay, Here with white splendour floods the silver wall. Less wondrous pile and less magnificent Sennamar built at Hirah, though his art Seal'd with one stone the ample edifice, And made its colours, like the serpent's skin, Play with a changeful beauty: him, its Lord, Jealous lest after effort might surpass The then unequall'd palace, from its height Dash'd on the pavement down. 14. They enter'd, and through aromatic paths Wondering they went along. At length, upon a mossy bank, Beneath a tall mimosa's shade, Which o'er him bent its living canopy, They saw a man reclined. Young he appear'd, for on his cheek there shone The morning glow of health, And the brown beard curl'd close around his chin. He slept, but at the sound Of coming feet awaking, fix'd his eyes In wonder, on the wanderer and her child. “Forgive us,” Zeinab cried, “Distress hath made us bold. Relieve the widow and the fatherless! Blessed are they who succour the distrest; For them hath God appointed Paradise.” 15. He heard, and he look'd up to heaven, And tears ran down his cheeks: “It is a human voice! I thank thee, O my God!.. How many an age hath past Since the sweet sounds have visited my ear! I thank thee, O my God, It is a human voice!” 16. To Zeinab turning then, he said, “O mortal, who art thou, Whose gifted eyes have pierced The shadow of concealment that hath wrapt These bowers, so many an age, From eye of mortal man? For countless years have past, And never foot of man The bowers of Irem trod,.. Save only I, a miserable wretch From Heaven and Earth shut out!” 17. Fearless, and scarce surprised, For grief in Zeinab's soul All other feebler feelings overpower'd, She answer'd, “Yesterday I was a wife beloved, The fruitful mother of a numerous race. I am a widow now, Of all my offspring this alone is left. Praise to the Lord our God, He gave, He takes away!” 18. Then said the stranger, “Not by Heaven unseen, Nor in unguided wanderings, hast thou reach'd This secret place, be sure! Nor for light purpose is the veil, That from the Universe hath long shut out These ancient bowers, withdrawn. Hear thou my words, O mortal, in thine heart Treasure what I shall tell; And when amid the world Thou shalt emerge again, Repeat the warning tale. Why have the fathers suffer'd, but to make The children wisely safe? 19. “The Paradise of Irem this, And this that wonder of the world, The Palace built by Shedad in his pride. Alas! in the days of my youth, The hum of mankind Was heard in yon wilderness waste; O'er all the winding sands The tents of Ad were pitch'd; Happy Al-Ahkaf then, For many and brave were her sons, Her daughters were many and fair. 20. “My name was Aswad then.. Alas! alas! how strange The sound so long unheard! Of noble race I came, One of the wealthy of the earth my sire. An hundred horses in my father's stall, Stood ready for his will; Numerous his robes of silk; The number of his camels was not known. These were my heritage, O God! thy gifts were these; But better had it been for Aswad's soul Had he ask'd alms on earth And begg'd the crumbs which from his table fell, So he had known thy Word. 21. “Boy, who hast reach'd my solitude, Fear the Lord in the days of thy youth! My knee was never taught To bend before my God; My voice was never taught To shape one holy prayer. We worshipp'd Idols, wood and stone, The work of our own foolish hands, We worshipp'd in our foolishness. Vainly the Prophet's voice Its frequent warning raised, ‘Repent and be forgiven!’.. We mock'd the messenger of God, We mock'd the Lord, long-suffering, slow to wrath. 22. “A mighty work the pride of Shedad plann'd, Here in the wilderness to form A Garden more surpassing fair Than that before whose gate The lightning of the Cherub's fiery sword Waves wide to bar access, Since Adam, the transgressor, thence was driven. Here, too, would Shedad build A kingly pile sublime, The Palace of his pride. For this exhausted mines Supplied their golden store; For this the central caverns gave their gems; For this the woodman's axe Open'd the cedar forest to the sun; The silkworm of the East Spun her sepulchral egg; The hunter Afri Provok'd the danger of the Elephant's rage; The Ethiop, keen of scent, Detects the ebony, That deep-inearth'd, and hating light, A leafless tree and barren of all fruit, With darkness feeds its boughs of raven grain. Such were the treasures lavish'd in yon pile; Ages have past away, And never mortal eye Gazed on their vanity. 23. “The Garden,..copious springs Blest that delightful spot, And every flower was planted there That makes the gale of evening sweet. He spake, and bade the full-grown forest rise, His own creation; should the King Wait for slow Nature's work? All trees that bend with luscious fruit, Or wave with feathery boughs, Or point their spiring heads to heaven, Or spreading wide their shadowy arms, Invite the traveller to repose at noon,.. Hither, uprooted with their native soil, The labour and the pain of multitudes,.. Mature in beauty, bore them. Here, frequent in the walks The marble statue stood Of heroes and of chiefs. The trees and flowers remain, By Nature's care perpetuate and self-sown. The marble statues long have lost all trace Of heroes and of chiefs; Huge shapeless stones they lie, O'ergrown with many a flower. 24. “The work of pride went on; Often the Prophet's voice Denounced impending woe; We mock'd at the words of the Seer, We mock'd at the wrath of the Lord. A long-continued drought first troubled us; Three years no cloud had form'd, Three years no rain had fallen; The wholesome herb was dry, The corn matured not for the food of man, The wells and fountains fail'd. O hard of heart, in whom the punishment Awoke no sense of guilt! Headstrong to ruin, obstinately blind, We to our Idols still applied for aid; Sakia we invoked for rain, We called on Razeka for food; They did not hear our prayers, they could not hear! No cloud appear'd in Heaven, No nightly dews came down. 25. “Then to the Place of Concourse messengers Were sent, to Mecca, where the nations came, Round the Red Hillock kneeling, to implore God in his favour'd place. We sent to call on God; Ah fools! unthinking that from all the earth The soul ascends to him. We sent to call on God; Ah fools! to think the Lord Would hear their prayers abroad, Who made no prayers at home! 26. “Meantime the work of pride went on, And still before our Idols, wood and stone, We bow'd the impious knee. ‘Turn, men of Ad, and call upon the Lord, The Prophet Houd exclaim'd; ‘Turn men of Ad, and look to Heaven, And fly the wrath to come.’— We mock'd the Prophet's words;.. ‘Now dost thou dream, old man, Or art thou drunk with wine? Future woe and wrath to come, Still thy prudent voice forebodes; When it comes will we believe, Till it comes, will we go on In the way our fathers went. Now are thy words from God? Or dost thou dream, old man, Or art thou drunk with wine?’ 27. “So spake the stubborn race, The unbelieving ones. I too, of stubborn unbelieving heart, Heard him, and heeded not. It chanced, my father went the way of man, He perish'd in his sins. The funeral rites were duly paid, We bound a Camel to his grave, And left it there to die, So if the resurrection came Together they might rise. I past my father's grave, I heard the Camel moan. She was his favourite beast, One who had carried me in infancy, The first that by myself I learn'd to mount. Her limbs were lean with famine, and her eyes Ghastly and sunk and dim. She knew me as I past, She stared me in the face; My heart was touch'd,..had it been human else? I thought that none was near, and cut her bonds, And drove her forth to liberty and life. The Prophet Houd had seen; He lifted up his voice, ‘Blessed art thou, young man, Blessed art thou, O Aswad, for the deed! In the Day of Visitation, In the fearful hour of Judgement, God will remember thee!’ 28. “The Day of Visitation was at hand, The fearful hour of Judgement hastened on. Lo! Shedad's mighty pile complete, The Palace of his pride. Would ye behold its wonders, enter in! I have no heart to visit it. Time hath not harm'd the eternal monument; Time is not here, nor days, nor months, nor years, An everlasting now of solitude!.. 29. “Ye must have heard their fame; Or likely ye have seen The mighty Pyramids,.. For sure those aweful piles have overlived The feeble generations of mankind. What though unmoved they bore the deluge weight, Survivors of the ruined world? What though their founder fill'd with miracles And wealth miraculous their spacious vaults? Compared with yonder fabric, and they shrink The baby wonders of a woman's work. 30. “Here emerald columns o'er the marble courts Shed their green rays, as when amid a shower The sun shines loveliest on the vernal corn. Here Shedad bade the sapphire floor be laid, As though with feet divine To tread on azure light, Like the blue pavement of the firmament. Here self-suspended hangs in air, As its pure substance loathed material touch, The living carbuncle; Sun of the lofty dome, Darkness hath no dominion o'er its beams; Intense it glows, an ever-flowing spring Of radiance, like the day-flood in its source. 31. “Impious! the Trees of vegetable gold Such as in Eden's groves Yet innocent it grew; Impious! he made his boast, though Heaven had hid So deep the baneful ore, That they should branch and bud for him, That art should force their blossoms and their fruit, And re-create for him whate'er Was lost in Paradise. Therefore at Shedad's voice Here tower'd the palm, a silver trunk, The fine gold net-work growing out Loose from its rugged boughs. Tall as the cedar of the mountain, here Rose the gold branches, hung with emerald leaves, Blossom'd with pearls, and rich with ruby fruit. 32. “O Ad! my country! evil was the day That thy unhappy sons Crouch'd at this Nimrod's throne, And placed him on the pedestal of power, And laid their liberties beneath his feet, Robbing their children of the heritance Their fathers handed down. What was to him the squander'd wealth? What was to him the burthen of the land, The lavish'd misery? He did but speak his will, And, like the blasting Siroc of the sands, The ruin of the royal voice Found its way every-where. I marvel not that he, whose power No earthly law, no human feeling curb'd, Mock'd at the living God! 33. “And now the King's command went forth Among the people, bidding old and young, Husband and wife, the master and the slave, All the collected multitudes of Ad, Here to repair, and hold high festival, That he might see his people, they behold Their King's magnificence and power. The day of festival arrived; Hither they came, the old man and the boy, Husband and wife, the master and the slave, Hither they came. From yonder high tower top, The loftiest of the Palace, Shedad look'd Down on his tribe: their tents on yonder sands Rose like the countless billows of the sea; Their tread and voices like the ocean roar, One deep confusion of tumultuous sounds. They saw their King's magnificence, beheld His palace sparkling like the Angel domes Of Paradise, his Garden like the bowers Of early Eden, and they shouted out, ‘Great is the King! a God upon the earth!’ 34. “Intoxicate with joy and pride, He heard their blasphemies; And in his wantonness of heart he bade The Prophet Houd be brought; And o'er the marble courts, And o'er the gorgeous rooms Glittering with gems and gold, He led the Man of God. ‘Is not this a stately pile?’ Cried the monarch in his joy. ‘Hath ever eye beheld, Hath ever thought conceived, Place more magnificent? Houd, they say that Heaven imparteth Words of wisdom to thy lips; Look at the riches round, And value them aright, If so thy wisdom can. 35. “The Prophet heard his vaunt, And, with an awful smile, he answer'd him, ‘O Shedad! only in the hour of death We learn to value things like these aright.’ 36. “‘Hast thou a fault to find In all thine eyes have seen?’ With unadmonish'd pride, the King exclaim'd. ‘Yea!’ said the Man of God; ‘The walls are weak, the building ill secure. Azrael can enter in! The Sarsar can pierce through, The Icy Wind of Death.’ 37. “I was beside the Monarch when he spake; Gentle the Prophet spake, But in his eye there dwelt A sorrow that disturbed me while I gazed. The countenance of Shedad fell, And anger sat upon his paler lips. He to the high tower-top the Prophet led, And pointed to the multitude, And as again they shouted out, ‘Great is the King! a God upon the Earth!’ With dark and threatful smile to Houd he turn'd, ‘Say they aright, O Prophet? is the King Great upon earth, a God among mankind?’ The Prophet answer'd not; Over that infinite multitude He roll'd his ominous eyes, And tears which could not be supprest gush'd forth. 38. “Sudden an uproar rose, A cry of joy below; ‘The messenger is come! Kaïl from Mecca comes, He brings the boon obtain'd!’ 39. “Forth as we went we saw where overhead There hung a deep black cloud, To which the multitude With joyful eyes look'd up, And blest the coming rain. The Messenger addrest the King And told his tale of joy. 40. “‘To Mecca I repair'd, By the Red Hillock knelt, And call'd on God for rain. My prayer ascended, and was heard; Three clouds appear'd in heaven, One white, and like the flying cloud of noon, One red, as it had drunk the evening beams, One black and heavy with its load of rain. A voice went forth from Heaven, ‘Choose, Kaïl, of the three!’ I thank'd the gracious Power, And chose the black cloud, heavy with its wealth. ‘Right! right!’ a thousand tongues exclaim'd, And all was merriment and joy. 41. “Then stood the Prophet up, and cried aloud, ‘Woe, woe to Irem! woe to Ad! Death is gone up into her palaces! Woe! woe! a day of guilt and punishment; A day of desolation!’—As he spake, His large eye roll'd in horror, and so deep His tone, it seem'd some Spirit from within Breathed through his moveless lips the unearthly voice. 42. “All looks were turn'd to him. ‘O Ad!’ he cried, ‘Dear native land, by all remembrances Of childhood, by all joys of manhood dear; O Vale of many Waters; morn and night My age must groan for you, and to the grave Go down in sorrow. Thou wilt give thy fruits, But who shall gather them? thy grapes will ripen, But who shall tread the wine-press? Fly the wrath, Ye who would live and save your souls alive! For strong is his right hand that bends the Bow, The Arrows that he shoots are sharp, And err not from their aim!’ 43. “With that a faithful few Prest through the throng to join him. Then arose Mockery and mirth; ‘Go, bald head!’ and they mix'd Curses with laughter. He set forth, yet once Look'd back:..his eye fell on me, and he call'd ‘Aswad!’..it startled me..it terrified;.. ‘Aswad!’ again he call'd,..and I almost Had follow'd him...O moment fled too soon! O moment irrecoverably lost! The shouts of mockery made a coward of me; He went, and I remain'd, in fear of Man! 44. “He went, and darker grew The deepening cloud above. At length it open'd, and..O God! O God! There were no waters there! There fell no kindly rain! The Sarsar from its womb went forth, The Icey Wind of Death. 45. “They fell around me; thousands fell around, The King and all his people fell; All! all! they perish'd all! I..only I..was left. There came a Voice to me and said, ‘In the Day of Visitation, In the fearful hour of Judgement, God hath remember'd thee.’ 46. “When from an agony of prayer I rose, And from the scene of death Attempted to go forth, The way was open, I could see No barrier to my steps. But round these bowers the Arm of God Had drawn a mighty chain, A barrier that no human force might break. Twice I essay'd to pass; With that a Voice was heard, ‘O Aswad, be content, and bless the Lord! One charitable deed hath saved Thy soul from utter death. O Aswad, sinful man! When by long penitence Thou feel'st thy soul prepared, Breathe up the wish to die, And Azrael comes in answer to thy prayer.’ 47. “A miserable man From Earth and Heaven shut out, I heard the dreadful Voice. I look'd around my prison-place, The bodies of the dead were there, Where'er I look'd they lay They moulder'd, moulder'd here,.. Their very bones have crumbled into dust, So many years have past! So many weary ages have gone by! And still I linger here, Still groaning with the burthen of my sins, Not yet have dared to breathe The prayer to be released. 48. “Oh! who can tell the unspeakable misery Of solitude like this! No sound hath ever reach'd my ear Save of the passing wind, The fountain's everlasting flow, The forest in the gale, The pattering of the shower, Sounds dead and mournful all. No bird hath ever closed her wing Upon these solitary bowers, No insect sweetly buzz'd amid these groves, From all things that have life, Save only me, conceal'd. This Tree alone, that o'er my head Hangs down its hospitable boughs, And bends its whispering leaves As though to welcome me, Seems to partake of life; I love it as my friend, my only friend! 49. “I know not for what ages I have dragg'd This miserable life; How often I have seen These ancient trees renew'd; What countless generations of mankind Have risen and fallen asleep, And I remain the same! My garment hath not waxen old, And the sole of my shoe is not worn. 50. “Sinner that I have been, I dare not offer up a prayer to die. O merciful Lord God!.. But when it is thy will, But when I have atoned For mine iniquities, And sufferings have made pure My soul with sin defiled, Release me in thine own good time;.. I will not cease to praise thee, O my God!” 51. Silence ensued awhile; Then Zeinab answer'd him; “Blessed art thou, O Aswad! for the Lord, Who saved thy soul from Hell, Will call thee to him in his own good time. And would that when my soul Breathed up the wish to die, Azrael might visit me! Then would I follow where my babes are gone, And join Hodeirah now!” 52. She ceased; and the rushing of wings Was heard in the stillness of night, And Azrael, the Death-Angel, stood before them. His countenance was dark, Solemn, but not severe, It awed, but struck no terror to the heart. “Zeinab, thy wish is heard! Aswad, thine hour is come!” They fell upon the ground and blest the voice; And Azrael from his sword Let fall the drops of bitterness and death. 53. ‘Me too! me too!” young Thalaba exclaim'd, As wild with grief he kiss'd His Mother's livid hand, His Mother's livid lips; “O Angel! take me too!” 54. “Son of Hodeirah!” the Death-Angel said, “It is not yet the hour. Son of Hodeirah, thou art chosen forth To do the will of Heaven; To avenge thy father's death, The murder of thy race; To work the mightiest enterprize That mortal man hath wrought. Live! and remember Destiny Hath mark'd thee from mankind!” 55. He ceased, and he was gone. Young Thalaba look'd round,.. The Palace and the groves were seen no more, He stood amid the Wilderness, alone. THE SECOND BOOK. Sint licet expertes vitæ sensusque, capessunt Jussa tamen superum venti. Mambruni Constantinus. 1. Not in the desert, Son of Hodeirah, Thou art abandon'd! The co-existent fire, Which in the Dens of Darkness burnt for thee, Burns yet, and yet shall burn. 2. In the Domdaniel caverns, Under the Roots of the Ocean, Met the Masters of the Spell. Before them in the vault, Blazing unfuel'd from its floor of rock, Ten magic flames arose. “Burn, mystic fires;” Abdaldar cried; “Burn while Hodeirah's dreaded race exist. This is the appointed hour, The hour that shall secure these dens of night.” 3. “Dim they burn!” exclaim'd Lobaba; “Dim they burn, and now they waver! Okba lifts the arm of death: They waver,..they go out!” 4. “Curse on his hasty hand!” Khawla exclaim'd in wrath, The woman-fiend exclaim'd, “Curse on his hasty hand, the fool hath fail'd Eight only are gone out.” 5. A Teraph stood against the cavern-side, A new-born infant's head, Which Khawla at its hour of birth had seized, And from the shoulders wrung. It stood upon a plate of gold, An unclean Spirit's name inscribed beneath. The cheeks were deathy dark, Dark the dead skin upon the hairless skull; The lips were bluey pale; Only the eyes had life, They gleam'd with demon light. 6. Tell me!” quoth Khawla, “is the Fire gone out That threats the Masters of the Spell?” The dead lips moved and spake, “The Fire still burns that threats The Masters of the Spell.” 7. “Curse on thee, Okba!” Khawla cried, As to the den the Sorcerer came; He bore the dagger in his hand, Red from the murder of Hodeirah's race. “Behold those unextinguish'd flames! The Fire still burns that threats The Masters of the Spell! Okba, wert thou weak of heart? Okba, wert thou blind of eye? Thy fate and ours were on the lot, And we believ'd the lying Stars, That said thy hand might seize the auspicious hour! Thou hast let slip the reins of Destiny,..... Curse thee, curse thee, Okba!” 8. The Murderer, answering, said, “O versed in all enchanted lore, Thou better knowest Okba's soul! Eight blows I struck, eight home-driven blows, Needed no second stroke From this envenom'd blade. Ye frown at me as if the will had fail'd; As if ye did not know My double danger from Hodeirah's race, The deeper hate I feel, The stronger motive that inspired my arm! Ye frown as if my hasty fault, My ill-directed blow, Had spared the enemy; And not the Stars that would not give, And not your feeble spells That could not force, the sign Which of the whole was he. Did ye not bid me strike them all? Said ye not root and branch should be destroy'd? I heard Hodeirah's dying groan, I heard his Children's shriek of death, And sought to consummate the work; But o'er the two remaining lives A cloud unpierceable had risen, A cloud that mock'd my searching eyes. I would have probed it with the dagger-point, The dagger was repell'd; A Voice came forth and said, ‘Son of Perdition, cease! Thou canst not change What in the Book of Destiny is written.’” 9. Khawla to the Teraph turn'd, “Tell me where the Prophet's hand Hides our destined enemy?” The dead lips spake again, “I view the seas, I view the land, I search the Ocean and the Earth! Not on Ocean is the Boy, Not on Earth his steps are seen.” 10. “A mightier power than we,” Lobaba cried, “Protects our destined foe. Look! look! one Fire burns dim! It quivers! it goes out!” 11. It quiver'd, it was quench'd. One Flame alone was left, A pale blue Flame that trembled on the floor, A hovering light, upon whose shrinking edge The darkness seem'd to press. Stronger it grew, and spread Its lucid swell around, Extending now where all the ten had stood With lustre more than all. 12. At that portentous sight, The Children of Evil trembled, And terror smote their souls. Over the den the Fire Its fearful splendour cast, The broad base rolling up in wavy streams, Bright as the summer lightning when it spreads Its glory o'er the midnight heaven. The Teraph's eyes were dimm'd, Which like two twinkling stars Shone in the darkness late. The Sorcerers on each other gazed, And every face, all pale with fear, And ghastly, in that light was seen Like a dead man's by the sepulchral lamp. 13. Even Khawla, fiercest of the enchanter brood, Not without effort drew Her fear-suspended breath. Anon a deeper rage Inflamed her reddening eye. “Mighty is thy power, Mahommed!” Loud in blasphemy she cried; “But Eblis would not stoop to Man, When Man, fair-statured as the stately palm From his Creator's hand Was undefiled and pure. Thou art mighty, O Son of Abdallah! But who is he of woman born That shall vie with the might of Eblis? That shall rival the Prince of the Morning?” 14. She said, and raised her skinny hand As in defiance to high Heaven, And stretch'd her long lean finger forth, And spake aloud the words of power. The Spirits heard her call, And lo! before her stands Her Demon Minister. “Spirit!” the Enchantress cried, “Where lives the Boy, coeval with whose life Yon magic Fire must burn?”DEMON. 15. Mistress of the mighty Spell, Not on Ocean, not on Earth. Only eyes that view Allah's glory-throne, See his hiding-place. From some believing Spirit, ask and learn. 16. “Bring the dead Hodeirah here,” Khawla cried, “and he shall tell!” The Demon heard her bidding, and was gone. A moment pass'd, and at her feet Hodeirah's corpse was laid; His hand still held the sword he grasp'd in death, The blood not yet had clotted on his wound. 17. The Sorceress look'd, and with a smile That kindled to more fiendishness Her hideous features, cried, “Where art thou, Hodeirah, now? Is thy soul in Zemzem-well? Is it in the Eden groves? Waits it for the judgement-blast In the trump of Israfil? Is it, plumed with silver wings, Underneath the throne of God? Even though beneath His throne, Hodeirah, thou shalt hear Thou shalt obey my voice!” 18. She said, and mutter'd charms which Hell in fear, And Heaven in horror heard. Soon the stiff eye-balls roll'd, The muscles with convulsive motion shook, The white lips quiver'd. Khawla saw, her soul Exulted, and she cried, “Prophet! behold my power! Not even death secures Thy slaves from Khawla's spell! Where, Hodeirah, is thy child?” 19. Hodeirah groan'd and closed his eyes, As if in the night and the blindness of death He would have hid himself. 20. “Speak to my question!” she exclaim'd, “Or in that mangled body thou shalt live Ages of torture! Answer me! Where can we find the boy?” 21. “God! God!” Hodeirah cried, “Release me from this life, From this intolerable agony!” 22. “Speak!” cried the Sorceress, and she snatch'd A Viper from the floor And with the living reptile lash'd his neck. Wreathed round him with the blow, The reptile tighter drew her folds, And raised her wrathful head, And fix'd into his face Her deadly teeth, and shed Poison in every wound. In vain! for Allah heard Hodeirah's prayer, And Khawla on a corpse Had wreak'd her baffled rage. The fated Fire moved on, And round the Body wrapt its funeral flames. The flesh and bones in that portentous pile Consumed; the Sword alone, Circled with fire, was left. 23. Where is the Boy for whose hand it is destined? Where the Destroyer who one day shall wield The Sword that is circled with fire? Race accursed, try your charms! Masters of the mighty Spell, Mutter o'er your words of power! Ye can shatter the dwellings of man; Ye can open the womb of the rock; Ye can shake the foundations of earth, But not the Word of God: But not one letter can ye change Of what his Will hath written! 24. Who shall seek through Araby Hodeirah's dreaded son? They mingle the Arrows of Chance, The lot of Abdaldar is drawn. Thirteen moons must wax and wane Ere the Sorcerer quit his quest. He must visit every tribe That roam the desert wilderness, Or dwell beside perennial streams; Nor leave a solitary tent unsearch'd, Till he hath found the Boy,.. The dreaded Boy, whose blood alone Can quench that fated Fire. 25. A crystal ring Abdaldar wore; The powerful gem condensed Primeval dews, that upon Caucasus Felt the first winter's frost. Ripening there it lay beneath Rock above rock, and mountain ice up-piled On mountain, till the incumbent mass assumed, So huge its bulk, the Ocean's azure hue. 26. With this he sought the inner den Where burnt the Eternal Fire. Like waters gushing from some channell'd rock Full through a narrow opening, from a chasm The Eternal Fire stream'd up. No eye beheld the spring Of that up-flowing Flame, Which blazed self-nurtured, and for ever, there. It was no mortal element; the Abyss Supplied it, from the fountains at the first Prepared. In the heart of earth it lives and glows Her vital heat, till, at the day decreed, The voice of God shall let its billows loose, To deluge o'er with no abating flood Our consummated World; Which must from that day in infinity Through endless ages roll, A penal orb of Fire. 27. Unturban'd and unsandal'd there, Abdaldar stood before the Flame, And held the Ring beside, and spake The language that the Elements obey. The obedient Flame detach'd a portion forth, Which, in the crystal entering, was condensed, Gem of the gem, its living Eye of fire. When the hand that wears the spell Shall touch the destined Boy, Then shall that Eye be quench'd, And the freed Element Fly to its sacred and remember'd Spring. 28. Now go thy way, Abdaldar! Servant of Eblis, Over Arabia Seek the Destroyer! Over the sands of the scorching Tehama, Over the waterless mountains of Naÿd; In Arud pursue him, and Yemen the happy, And Hejaz, the country beloved by believers, Over Arabia, Servant of Eblis, Seek the Destroyer! 29. From tribe to tribe, from town to town, From tent to tent, Abdaldar pass'd. Him every morn the all-beholding Eye Saw from his couch, unhallow'd by a prayer, Rise to the scent of blood; And every night lie down, That rankling hope within him, that by day Goaded his steps, still stinging him in sleep, And startling him with vain accomplishment From visions still the same Many a time his wary hand To many a youth applied the Ring; And still the imprison'd Fire Within its crystal socket lay comprest, Impatient to be free. 30. At length to the cords of a tent, That were stretch'd by an Island of Palms, In the desolate sea of the sands, The seemly traveller came. Under a shapely palm, Herself as shapely, there a Damsel stood; She held her ready robe, And look'd towards a Boy, Who from the tree above, With one hand clinging to its trunk, Cast with the other down the cluster'd dates. 31. The Magician approach'd the Tree, He lean'd on his staff, like a way-faring man, And the sweat of his travel was seen on his brow. He ask'd for food, and lo! The Damsel proffers him her lap of dates; And the Stripling descends, and runs to the tent, And brings him forth water, the draught of delight. 32. Anon the Master of the tent, The Father of the family, Came forth, a man in years, of aspect mild. To the stranger approaching he gave The friendly saluting of peace, And bade the skin be spread. Before the tent they spread the skin, Under a Tamarind's shade, That, bending forward, stretch'd Its boughs of beauty far. 33. They brought the Traveller rice, With no false colours tinged to tempt the eye, But white as the new-fallen snow, When never yet the sullying Sun Hath seen its purity, Nor the warm zephyr touch'd and tainted it. The dates of the grove before their guest They laid, and the luscious fig, And water from the well. 34. The Damsel from the Tamarind tree Had pluck'd its acid fruit, And steep'd it in water long; And whoso drank of the cooling draught, He would not wish for wine. This to their guest the Damsel brought, And a modest pleasure kindled her cheek, When raising from the cup his moisten'd lips, The stranger smiled, and praised, and drank again. 35. Whither is gone the Boy? He had pierced the Melon's pulp, And closed with wax the wound, And he had duly gone at morn And watch'd its ripening rind, And now all joyfully he brings The treasure now matured; His dark eyes sparkling with a boy's delight, As out he pours its liquid lusciousness, And proffers to the guest. 36. Abdaldar ate, and he was satisfied: And now his tongue discoursed Of regions far remote, As one whose busy feet had travell'd long. The father of the family, With a calm eye and quiet smile, Sate pleased to hearken him. The Damsel who removed the meal, She loiter'd on the way, And listen'd with full hands A moment motionless. 37. All eagerly the Boy Watches the Traveller's lips; And still the wily man With seemly kindness, to the eager Boy Directs his winning tale. Ah, cursed one! if this be he, If thou hast found the object of thy search, Thy hate, thy bloody aim,... Into what deep damnation wilt thou plunge Thy miserable soul!... 38. Look! how his eye delighted watches thine!.. Look! how his open lips Gape at the winning tale!.. And nearer now he comes, To lose no word of that delightful talk. Then, as in familiar mood, Upon the stripling's arm The Sorcerer laid his hand, And the Fire of the Crystal fled. 39. While the sudden shoot of joy Made pale Abdaldar's cheek, The Master's voice was heard; “It is the hour of prayer,.. My children, let us purify ourselves, And praise the Lord our God!” The Boy the water brought; After the law they purified themselves, And bent their faces to the earth in prayer. 40. All, save Abdaldar; over Thalaba He stands, and lifts the dagger to destroy. Before his lifted arm received Its impulse to descend, The Blast of the Desert came. Prostrate in prayer, the pious family Felt not the Simoom pass. They rose, and lo! the Sorcerer lying dead, Holding the dagger in his blasted hand. THE THIRD BOOK. Time will produce events of which thou canst have no idea; and he to whom thou gavest no commission, will bring thee unexpected news. Moallakat. Poem of Tarafa. 1. THALABA. Oneiza, look! the dead man has a ring,.. Should it be buried with him? ONEIZA. Oh yes..yes! A wicked man! whate'er is his must needs Be wicked too! THALABA. But see,..the sparkling stone? How it hath caught the glory of the Sun, And shoots it back again in lines of light! ONEIZA. Why do you take it from him, Thalaba?.. And look at it so close?..it may have charms To blind, or poison;..throw it in the grave! I would not touch it! THALABA. And around its rim Strange letters... ONEIZA. Bury it..oh! bury it! THALABA. It is not written as the Koran is: Some other tongue perchance;..the accursed man Said he had been a traveller. MOATH (coming from the tent.) Thalaba, What hast thou there? THALABA. A ring the dead man wore; Perhaps, my father, you can read its meaning. MOATH. No, Boy;..the letters are not such as ours. Heap the sand over it! a wicked man Wears nothing holy. THALABA. Nay! not bury it! It may be that some traveller, who shall enter Our tent, may read it: or if we approach Cities where strangers dwell and learned men, They may interpret. MOATH. It were better hid Under the desert sands. This wretched man, Whom God hath smitten in the very purpose And impulse of his unpermitted crime, Belike was some magician, and these lines Are of the language that the Demons use. ONEIZA. Bury it! bury it!...dear Thalaba! MOATH. Such cursed men there are upon the earth, In league and treaty with the Evil powers, The covenanted enemies of God And of all good; dear purchase have they made Of rule and riches, and their life-long sway, Masters, yet slaves of Hell. Beneath the roots Of Ocean, the Domdaniel caverns lie, Their impious meeting; there they learn the words Unutterable by man who holds his hope Of heaven; there brood the pestilence, and let The earthquake loose. THALABA. And he who would have kill'd me Was one of these? MOATH. I know not;..but it may be That on the Table of Destiny, thy name Is written their Destroyer, and for this Thy life by yonder miserable man So sought; so saved by interfering Heaven. THALABA. His ring has some strange power then? MOATH. Every gem, So sages say, hath virtue; but the science, Of difficult attainment; some grow pale, Conscious of poison, or with sudden change Of darkness, warn the wearer; some preserve From spells, or blunt the hostile weapon's edge; Some open rocks and mountains, and lay bare Their buried treasures; others make the sight Strong to perceive the presence of those Beings Through whose pure essence as through empty air The unaided eye would pass; And in yon stone I deem Some such mysterious quality resides. THALABA. My father, I will wear it. MOATH. Thalaba! THALABA. In God's name, and the Prophet's! be its power Good, let it serve the righteous; if for evil, God, and my trust in Him, shall hallow it. 2. So Thalaba drew on The written ring of gold. Then in the hollow grave They laid Abdaldar's corpse, And levell'd over him the desert dust. 3. The Sun arose, ascending from beneath The horizon's circling line. As Thalaba to his ablutions went, Lo! the grave open, and the corpse exposed! It was not that the winds of night Had swept away the sands which cover'd it; For heavy with the undried dew The desert dust lay dark and close around; And the night air had been so calm and still, It had not from the grove Shaken a ripe date down. 4. Amazed to hear the tale, Forth from the tent came Moath and his child. Awhile he stood contemplating the corpse Silent and thoughtfully; Then turning, spake to Thalaba, and said, “I have heard that there are places by the abode Of holy men, so holily possess'd, That should a corpse be laid irreverently Within their precincts, the insulted ground Impatient of pollution, heaves and shakes The abomination out. Have then in elder times the happy feet Of Patriarch, or of Prophet bless'd the place, Ishmael, or Houd, or Saleah, or than all, Mahommed, holier name? Or is the man So foul with magic and all blasphemy, That Earth, like Heaven, rejects him? It is best Forsake the station. Let us strike our tent. The place is tainted..and behold The Vulture hovers yonder, and his scream Chides us that still we scare him from the prey. So let the accursed one, Torn by that beak obscene, Find fitting sepulchre.” 5. Then from the pollution of death With water they made themselves pure; And Thalaba drew up The fastening of the cords; And Moath furl'd the tent; And from the grove of palms Oneiza led The Camels, ready to receive their load. 6. The dews had ceased to steam Toward the climbing Sun, When from the Isle of Palms they went their way; And when the Sun had reach'd his southern height, As back they turn'd their eyes, The distant Palms arose Like to the top-sails of some fleet far-off Distinctly seen, where else The Ocean bounds had blended with the sky; And when the eve came on, The sight returning reach'd the grove no more. They planted the pole of their tent, And they laid them down to repose. 7. At midnight Thalaba started up, For he felt that the ring on his finger was moved; He call'd on Allah aloud, And he call'd on the Prophet's name. Moath arose in alarm; “What ails thee, Thalaba?” he cried, “Is the robber of night at hand?” “Dost thou not see,” the youth exclaim'd, “A Spirit in the tent?” Moath look'd round and said, “The moon-beam shines in the tent, I see thee stand in the light, And thy shadow is black on the ground.” 8. Thalaba answer'd not. “Spirit!” he cried, “what brings thee here? In the name of the Prophet speak, In the name of Allah, obey!” 9. He ceased, and there was silence in the tent. “Dost thou not hear?” quoth Thalaba; The listening man replied, “I hear the wind, that flaps The curtain of the tent.” 10. “The Ring! the Ring!” the youth exclaim'd. “For that the Spirit of Evil comes; By that I see, by that I hear. In the name of God, I ask thee, Who was he that slew my Father?” DEMON. Master of the powerful Ring! Okba, the dread Magician, did the deed. THALABA. Where does the Murderer dwell? DEMON. In the Domdaniel caverns, Under the Roots of the Ocean. THALABA. Why were my Father and my brethren slain? DEMON. We knew from the race of Hodeirah The destined Destroyer would come. THALABA. Bring me my father's sword! DEMON. A Fire surrounds the fatal sword; No Spirit or Magician's hand Can pierce that fated Flame. THALABA. Bring me his bow and his arrows! 11. Distinctly Moath heard the youth, and She Who, through the Veil of Separation, watch'd The while in listening terror, and suspense All too intent for prayer. They heard the voice of Thalaba; But when the Spirit spake, the motionless air Felt not the subtile sounds, Too fine for mortal sense. 12. On a sudden the rattle of arrows was heard, And a quiver was laid at the feet of the youth, And in his hand they saw Hodeirah's bow. He eyed the bow, he twang'd the string, And his heart bounded to the joyous tone. Anon he raised his voice and cried, “Go thy way, and never more, Evil Spirit, haunt our tent! By the virtue of the Ring, By Mahommed's holier might, By the holiest name of God, Thee, and all the Powers of Hell, I adjure and I command Never more to trouble us!” 13. Nor ever from that hour Did rebel Spirit on the tent intrude Such virtue had the Spell. 14. Thus peacefully the vernal years Of Thalaba past on, Till now, without an effort, he could bend Hodeirah's stubborn bow. Black were his eyes and bright, The sunny hue of health Glow'd on his tawny cheek, His lip was darken'd by maturing life; Strong were his shapely limbs, his stature tall; Peerless among Arabian youths was he. 15. Compassion for the child Had first old Moath's kindly heart possess'd, An orphan, wailing in the wilderness; But when he heard his tale, his wondrous tale, Told by the boy, with such eye-speaking truth Now with sudden bursts of anger, Now in the agony of tears, And now with flashes of prophetic joy, What had been pity became reverence then, And, like a sacred trust from Heaven, The Old Man cherish'd him. Now, with a father's love, Child of his choice, he loved the Boy, And, like a father, to the Boy was dear. Oneiza call'd him brother; and the youth More fondly than a brother loved the maid; The loveliest of Arabian maidens she. How happily the years Of Thalaba went by! 16. It was the wisdom and the will of Heaven, That in a lonely tent had cast The lot of Thalaba; There might his soul develope best Its strengthening energies; There might he from the world Keep his heart pure and uncontaminate, Till at the written hour he should be found Fit servant of the Lord, without a spot. 17. Years of his youth, how rapidly ye fled In that beloved solitude! Is the morn fair, and doth the freshening breeze Flow with cool current o'er his cheek? Lo! underneath the broad-leaved sycamore With lids half-closed he lies, Dreaming of days to come. His dog beside him, in mute blandishment, Now licks his listless hand; Now lifts an anxious and expectant eye, Courting the wonted caress. 18. Or comes the Father of the Rains From his caves in the uttermost West, Comes he in darkness and storms? When the blast is loud; When the waters fill The traveller's tread in the sands; When the pouring shower Streams adown the roof; When the door-curtain hangs in heavier folds: When the out-strain'd tent flags loosely: Within there is the embers' chearful glow, The sound of the familiar voice, The song that lightens toil,.. Domestic Peace and Comfort are within. Under the common shelter, on dry sand, The quiet Camels ruminate their food; The lengthening cord from Moath falls, As patiently the Old Man Entwines the strong palm-fibres; by the hearth The Damsel shakes the coffee-grains, That with warm fragrance fill the tent; And while, with dexterous fingers, Thalaba Shapes the green basket, haply at his feet Her favourite kidling gnaws the twig, Forgiven plunderer, for Oneiza's sake. 19. Or when the winter torrent rolls Down the deep-channel'd rain-course, foamingly, Dark with its mountain spoils, With bare feet pressing the wet sand, There wanders Thalaba, The rushing flow, the flowing roar, Filling his yielded faculties, A vague, a dizzy, a tumultuous joy. 20. Or lingers it a vernal brook Gleaming o'er yellow sands? Beneath the lofty bank reclined, With idle eye he views its little waves, Quietly listening to the quiet flow; While in the breathings of the stirring gale, The tall canes bend above, Floating like streamers on the wind Their bank uplifted leaves. 21. Nor rich, nor poor, was Moath; God hath given Enough, and blest him with a mind content. No hoarded gold disquieted his dreams; But ever round his station he beheld Camels that knew his voice, And home-birds, grouping at Oneiza's call, And goats that, morn and eve, Came with full udders to the Damsel's hand. Dear child! the tent beneath whose shade they dwelt It was her work; and she had twined His girdle's many hues; And he had seen his robe Grow in Oneiza's loom. How often, with a memory-mingled joy Which made her Mother live before his sight, He watch'd her nimble fingers thread the woof! Or at the hand-mill, when she knelt and toil'd, Toss'd the thin cake on spreading palm, Of fix'd it on the glowing oven's side With bare wet arm, and safe dexterity. 22. 'Tis the cool evening hour: The Tamarind from the dew Sheathes its young fruit, yet green. Before their tent the mat is spread; The Old Man's solemn voice Intones the holy Book. What if beneath no lamp-illumined dome, Its marble walls bedeck'd with flourish'd truth, Azure and gold adornment? sinks the word With deeper influence from the Imam's voice, Where in the day of congregation, crowds Perform the duty-task? Their Father is their Priest, The Stars of Heaven their point of prayer, And the blue Firmament The glorious Temple, where they feel The present Deity. 23. Yet through the purple glow of eve Shines dimly the white moon. The slacken'd bow, the quiver, the long lance, Rest on the pillar of the Tent. Knitting light palm-leaves for her brother's brow, The dark-eyed damsel sits; The Old Man tranquilly Up his curl'd pipe inhales The tranquillizing herb. So listen they the reed of Thalaba, While his skill'd fingers modulate The low, sweet, soothing, melancholy tones. 24. Or if he strung the pearls of Poesy, Singing with agitated face And eloquent arms, and sobs that reach the heart, A tale of love and woe; Then, if the brightening Moon that lit his face, In darkness favour'd her's, Oh! even with such a look, as fables say, The Mother Ostrich fixes on her egg, Till that intense affection Kindle its light of life, Even in such deep and breathless tenderness Oneiza's soul is centred on the youth, So motionless, with such an ardent gaze,. Save when from her full eyes She wipes away the swelling tears That dim his image there. 25. She call'd him Brother; was it sister-love For which the silver rings Round her smooth ankles and her tawny arms, Shone daily brighten'd? for a brother's eye Were her long fingers tinged, As when she trimm'd the lamp, And through the veins and delicate skin The light shone rosy? that the darken'd lids Gave yet a softer lustre to her eye? That with such pride she trick'd Her glossy tresses, and on holy-day Wreathed the red flower-crown round Their waves of glossy jet? How happily the days Of Thalaba went by! Years of his youth how rapidly ye fled! 26. Yet was the heart of Thalaba Impatient of repose; Restless he ponder'd still The task for him decreed, The mighty and mysterious work announced. Day by day, with youthful ardour, He the call of Heaven awaits; And oft in visions, o'er the murderer's head, He lifts the avenging arm; And oft, in dreams, he sees The Sword that is circled with fire. 27. One morn, as was their wont, in sportive mood, The youth and damsel bent Hodeirah's bow; For with no feeble hand, or erring aim, Oneiza could let loose the obedient shaft. With head back-bending, Thalaba Shot up the aimless arrow high in air, Whose line in vain the aching sight pursued, Lost in the depth of Heaven. “When will the hour arrive,” exclaim'd the youth, “That I shall aim these fated shafts To vengeance long delay'd? Have I not strength, my father, for the deed? Or can the will of Providence Be mutable like man? Shall I never be call'd to the task?” 28. “Impatient boy!” quoth Moath, with a smile: “Impatient Thalaba!” Oneiza cried, And she too smiled; but in her smile A mild reproachful melancholy mix'd. 29. Then Moath pointed where a cloud Of locusts, from the desolated fields Of Syria, wing'd their way. “Lo! how created things Obey the written doom!” 30. Onward they came, a dark continuous cloud Of congregated myriads numberless, The rushing of whose wings was as the sound Of some broad river, headlong in its course Plunged from a mountain summit; or the roar Of a wild ocean in the autumnal storm, Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks. Onward they came, the winds impell'd them on, Their work was done, their path of ruin past, Their graves were ready in the wilderness. 31. “Behold the mighty army!” Moath cried, “Blindly they move, impell'd By the blind Element. And yonder birds, our welcome visitants, See! where they soar above the embodied host, Pursue their way, and hang upon the rear, And thin the spreading flanks, Rejoicing o'er their banquet! Deemest thou The scent of water on some Syrian mosque Placed with priest-mummery and fantastic rites Which fool the multitude, hath led them here From far Khorassan? Allah who appoints, Yon swarms to be a punishment of man, These also hath he doom'd to meet their way: Both passive instruments Of his all-acting will, Sole mover He, and only spring of all.” 32. While thus he spake, Oneiza's eye looks up Where one toward her flew, Satiate, for so it seem'd, with sport and food. The Bird flew over her, And as he past above, From his relaxing grasp a Locust fell;.. It fell upon the Maiden's robe, And feebly there it stood, recovering slow. 33. The admiring girl survey'd His out-spread sails of green; His gauzy underwings, One closely to the grass-green body furl'd, One ruffled in the fall, and half unclosed. She view'd his jet-orb'd eyes, His glossy gorget bright, Green glittering in the sun; His plumy pliant horns, That, nearer as she gazed, Bent tremblingly before her breath. She mark'd his yellow-circled front With lines mysterious vein'd; And “know'st thou what is her inscribed, My father?” said the Maid. “Look, Thalaba! perchance these lines Are in the letters of the Ring, Nature's own language written here.” 34. The youth bent down, and suddenly He started, and his heart Sprung, and his cheek grew red, For these mysterious lines were legible,.. When the sun shall be darkened at noon, Son of Hodeirah, depart. And Moath look'd, and read the lines aloud; The Locust shook his wings and fled, And they were silent all. 35. Who then rejoiced but Thalaba? Who then was troubled but the Arabian Maid? And Moath sad of heart, Though with a grief supprest, beheld the youth Sharpen his arrows now, And now new-plume their shafts, Now, to beguile impatient hope, Feel every sharpen'd point. 36. “Why is that anxious look,” Oneiza ask'd, “Still upward cast at noon? Is Thalaba aweary of our tent?” “I would be gone,” the youth replied, “That I might do my task, And full of glory to the tent return, Whence I should part no more.” 37. But on the noontide sun, As anxious and as oft, Oneiza's eye Was upward glanced in fear. And now, as Thalaba replied, her cheek Lost its fresh and lively hue; For in the Sun's bright edge She saw, or thought she saw, a little speck. The sage Astronomer Who, with the love of science full, Trembled that day at every passing cloud,.. He had not seen it, 't was a speck so small. 38. Alas! Oneiza sees the spot increase! And lo! the ready youth Over his shoulder the full quiver slings, And grasps the slacken'd bow. It spreads, and spreads, and now Hath shadow'd half the sun, Whose crescent-pointed horns Now momently decrease. 39. The day grows dark, the birds retire to rest Forth from her shadowy haunt Flies the large-headed screamer of the night. Far off the affrighted African, Deeming his God deceased, Falls on his knees in prayer, And trembles as he sees The fierce hyena's eyes Glare in the darkness of that dreadful noon. 40. Then Thalaba exclaim'd, “Farewell, My father! my Oneiza!” the Old Man Felt his throat swell with grief. “Where wilt thou go, my child?” he cried, “Wilt thou not wait a sign To point thy destined way?” “God will conduct me!” said the faithful youth He said, and from the tent, In the depth of the darkness departed. They heard his parting steps, The quiver rattling as he past away. THE FOURTH BOOK. Fas est quoque brutæ Telluri, docilem monitis cœlestibus esse. Mambruni Constantinus. 1. Whose is yon dawning form, That in the darkness meets The delegated youth? Dim as the shadow of a fire at noon, Or pale reflection on the evening brook Of glow-worm on the bank, Kindled to guide her winged paramour. 2. A moment, and the brightening image shaped His Mother's form and features. “Go,” she cried, “To Babylon, and from the Angels learn What talisman thy task requires.” 3. The Spirit hung toward him when she ceased, As though with actual lips she would have given A mother's kiss. His arms outstretch'd, His body bending on, His mouth unclosed and trembling into speech, He prest to meet the blessing,..but the wind Play'd on his cheek: he look'd, and he beheld The darkness close. “Again! again!” he cried, “Let me again behold thee!” from the darkness His Mother's voice went forth; “Thou shalt behold me in the hour of death.” 4. Day dawns, the twilight gleam dilates, The Sun comes forth, and like a god Rides through rejoicing heaven. Old Moath and his daughter, from their tent, Beheld the adventurous youth, Dark-moving o'er the sands, A lessening image, trembling through their tears. Visions of high emprize Beguiled his lonely road; And if sometimes to Moath's tent The involuntary mind recurr'd, Fancy, impatient of all painful thoughts, Pictured the bliss should welcome his return. In dreams like these he went, And still of every dream Oneiza form'd a part, And hope and memory made a mingled joy. 5. In the eve he arrived at a Well; An Acacia bent over its side, Under whose long light-hanging boughs He chose his night's abode. There, due ablutions made, and prayers perform'd, The youth his mantle spread, And silently produced His solitary meal. The silence and the solitude recall'd Dear recollections; and with folded arms, Thinking of other days, he sate, till thought Had left him, and the Acacia's moving shade Upon the sunny sand, Had caught his idle eye; And his awaken'd ear Heard the grey Lizard's chirp, The only sound of life. 6. As thus in vacant quietness he sate, A Traveller on a Camel reach'd the Well, And courteous greeting gave. The mutual salutation past, He by the cistern too his garment spread, And friendly converse cheer'd the social meal. 7. The Stranger was an antient man, Yet one whose green old age Bore the fair characters of temperate youth: So much of manhood's strength his limbs retain'd, It seem'd he needed not the staff he bore. His beard was long, and grey, and crisp; Lively his eyes and quick, And reaching over them The large broad eye-brow curl'd. His speech was copious, and his winning words Enrich'd with knowledge, that the attentive youth Sate listening with a thirsty joy. 8. So in the course of talk, The adventurer youth enquir'd Whither his course was bent? The Old Man answered, “To Bagdad I go.” At that so welcome sound, a flash of joy Kindled the eye of Thalaba; “And I too,” he replied, “Am journeying thitherward; Let me become companion of thy way!” Courteous the Old Man smiled, And willing in assent. 9. OLD MAN. Son, thou art young for travel. THALABA. Until now I never past the desert boundary. OLD MAN It is a noble city that we seek. Thou wilt behold magnificent palaces, And lofty minarets, and high-domed Mosques, And rich Bazars, whither from all the world Industrious merchants meet, and market there The World's collected wealth. THALABA. Stands not Bagdad Near to the site of ancient Babylon And Nimrod's impious temple? OLD MAN. From the walls 'T is but a long day's distance. THALABA. And the ruins? OLD MAN. A mighty mass remains; enough to tell us How great our fathers were, how little we. Men are not what they were; their crimes and follies Have dwarf'd them down from the old hero race To such poor things as we! THALABA. At Babylon I have heard the Angels expiate their guilt, Haruth and Maruth. OLD MAN. 'T is a history Handed from ages down; a nurse's tale.. Which children open-eyed and mouth'd devour; And thus as garrulous ignorance relates, We learn it and believe...But all things feel The power of Time and Change; thistles and grass Usurp the desolate palace, and the weeds Of falsehood root in the aged pile of Truth. How have you heard the tale? THALABA. Thus..on a time The Angels at the wickedness of man Express'd indignant wonder; that in vain Tokens and signs were given, and Prophets sent,.. Strange obstinacy this! a stubbornness Of sin, they said, that should for ever bar The gates of mercy on them. Allah heard Their unforgiving pride, and bade that two Of these untempted Spirits should descend, Judges on Earth. Haruth and Maruth went, The chosen Sentencers; they fairly heard The appeals of men to their tribunal brought, And rightfully decided. At the length A Woman came before them; beautiful Zohara was, as yonder Evening Star, In the mild lustre of whose lovely light Even now her beauty shines. They gazed on her With fleshly eyes, they tempted her to sin. The wily woman listen'd, and required A previous price, the knowledge of the name Of God. She learnt the wonder-working name, And gave it utterance, and its virtue bore her Up to the glorious Presence, and she told Before the awful Judgement-Seat her tale. OLD MAN. I know the rest. The accused Spirits were call'd; Unable of defence, and penitent, They own'd their crime, and heard the doom deserved. They they besought the Lord, that not for ever His wrath might be upon them; and implored That penal ages might at length restore them Clean from offence; since then by Babylon, In the cavern of their punishment, they dwell. Runs the conclusion so? THALABA. So I am taught. OLD MAN. The common tale! And likely thou hast heard How that the bold and bad, with impious rites Intrude upon their penitence, and force, Albeit from loathing and reluctant lips, The sorcery-secret? THALABA. Is it not the truth? OLD MAN. Son, thou hast seen the Traveller in the sands Move through the dizzy light of hot noon-day, Huge as the giant race of elder times; And his Camel, than the monstrous Elephant, Seem of a vaster bulk. THALABA. A frequent sight. OLD MAN. And hast thou never, in the twilight, fancied Familiar object into some strange shape And form uncouth? THALABA. Aye! many a time. OLD MAN. Even so Things view'd at distance through the mist of fear. By their distortion terrify and shock The abused sight. THALABA. But of these Angels' fate Thus in the uncreated book is written. OLD MAN. Wisely from legendary fables, Heaven Inculcates wisdom. THALABA. How then is the truth? Is not the dungeon of their punishment By ruin'd Babylon? OLD MAN. By Babylon Haruth and Maruth may be found. THALABA. And there Magicians learn their impious sorcery? OLD MAN. Son, what thou say'st is true, and it is false. But night approaches fast; I have travell'd far, And my old lids are heavy;..on our way We shall have hours for converse;..let us now Turn to our due repose. Son, peace be with thee! 10. So in his loosen'd cloak The Old Man wrapt himself, And laid his limbs at length; And Thalaba in silence laid him down. Awhile he lay, and watch'd the lovely Moon, O'er whose broad orb the boughs A mazy fretting framed, Or with a pale transparent green Lighting the restless leaves, The thin Acacia leaves that play'd above. The murmuring wind, the moving leaves, Soothed him at length to sleep, With mingled lullabies of sight and sound. 11. Not so the dark Magician by his side, Lobaba, who from the Domdaniel caves Had sought the dreaded youth. Silent he lay, and simulating sleep, Till by the long and regular breath he knew The youth beside him slept. Carefully then he rose, And bending over him, survey'd him near; And secretly he cursed The dead Abdaldar's ring, Arm'd by whose amulet He slept from danger safe. 12. Wrapt in his mantle Thalaba reposed, His loose right arm pillowing his easy head. The Moon was on the Ring, Whose crystal gem return'd A quiet, moveless light. Vainly the Wizard vile put forth his hand, And strove to reach the gem; Charms, strong as hell could make them, kept it safe. He call'd his servant-fiends, He bade the Genii rob the sleeping youth. By the virtue of the Ring, By Mahommed's holier power, By the holiest name of God, Had Thalaba disarm'd the evil race. 13. Baffled and weary, and convinced at length, Anger, and fear, and rancour gnawing him, The accursed Sorcerer ceased his vain attempts, Content perforce to wait Temptation's likelier aid. Restless he lay, and brooding many a wile, And tortured with impatient hope, And envying with the bitterness of hate The innocent youth, who slept so sweetly by. 14. The ray of morning on his eye-lids fell, And Thalaba awoke, And folded his mantle around him, And girded his loins for the day; Then the due rites of holiness observed. His comrade too arose, And with the outward forms Of righteousness and prayer insulted God. They fill'd their water skin, they gave The Camel his full draught. Then on the road, while yet the morn was young, And the air was fresh with dew, Forward the travellers went, With various talk beguiling the long way. But soon the youth, whose busy mind Dwelt on Lobaba's wonder-stirring words, Renew'd the unfinish'd converse of the night. 15. THALABA. Thou said'st that it is true, and yet is false, That men accurst attain at Babylon Forbidden knowledge from the Angel pair:... How mean you? LOBABA. All things have a double power, Alike for good and evil. The same fire That on the comfortable hearth at eve Warm'd the good man, flames o'er the house at night; Should we for this forego The needful element? Because the scorching summer Sun Darts fever, wouldst thou quench the orb of day? Or deemest thou that Heaven in anger form'd Iron to till the field, because when man Had tipt his arrows for the chase, he rush'd A murderer to the war? THALABA. What follows hence? LOBABA. That nothing in itself is good or evil, But only in its use. Think you the man Praiseworthy, who by painful study learns The knowledge of all simples, and their power, Healing or harmful? THALABA. All men hold in honour The skilful Leech. From land to land he goes Safe in his privilege; the sword of war Spares him; Kings welcome him with costly gifts; And he who late had from the couch of pain Lifted a languid look to him for aid, Beholds him with glad eyes, and blesses him In his first thankful prayer. LOBABA. Yet some there are Who to the purposes of wickedness Apply this knowledge, and from herbs distil Poison, to mix it in the trusted draught. THALABA. Allah shall cast them in the eternal fire Whose fuel is the cursed! there shall they Endure the ever-burning agony, Consuming still in flames, and still renew'd. LOBABA. But is their knowledge therefore in itself Unlawful? THALABA. That were foolishness to think. LOBABA. O what a glorious animal were Man, Knew he but his own powers, and, knowing, gave them Room for their growth and spread! The Horse obeys His guiding will; the patient Camel bears him Over these wastes of sand; the Pigeon wafts His bidding through the sky;..and with these triumphs He rests contented!..with these ministers,.. When he might awe the Elements, and make Myriads of Spirits serve him! THALABA. But as how? By a league with Hell, a covenant that binds The soul to utter death! LOBABA. Was Solomon Accurst of God? Yet to his talismans Obedient, o'er his throne the birds of Heaven, Their waving wings his sun-shield, fann'd around him The motionless air of noon; from place to place, As his will rein'd the viewless Element, He rode the Wind; the Genii rear'd his temple, And ceaselessly in fear while his dread eye O'erlook'd them, day and night pursued their toil, So dreadful was his power. THALABA. But 't was from Heaven His wisdom came; God's special gift,..the guerdon Of early virtue. LOBABA. Learn thou, O young man! God hath appointed wisdom the reward Of study! 'Tis a well of living waters, Whose inexhaustible bounties all might drink, But few dig deep enough. Son! thou art silent,.. Perhaps I say too much,..perhaps offend thee. THALABA. Nay, I am young, and willingly, as becomes me, Hear the wise words of age. LOBABA. Is it a crime To mount the Horse, because forsooth thy feet Can serve thee for the journey?..Is it sin, Because the Hern soars upward in the sky Above the arrow's flight, to train the Falcon Whose beak shall pierce him there? The powers which Allah Granted to man, were granted for his use; All knowledge that befits not human weakness Is placed beyond its reach...They who repair To Babylon, and from the Angels learn Mysterious wisdom, sin not in the deed. THALABA. Know you these secrets? LOBABA. I? alas! my Son, My age just knows enough to understand How little all its knowledge! Later years Sacred to study, teach me to regret Youth's unforeseeing indolence, and hours That cannot be recall'd! Something I know The properties of herbs, and have sometimes Brought to the afflicted comfort and relief By the secrets of my art; under His blessing Without whom all had fail'd! Also of Gems I have some knowledge, and the characters That tell beneath what aspect they were set. THALABA. Belike you can interpret then the graving Around this Ring! LOBABA. My sight is feeble, Son, And I must view it closer; let me try! 16. The unsuspecting Youth Held forth his finger to draw off the spell. Even whilst he held it forth, There settled there a Wasp, And just above the Gem infix'd its dart; All purple-swoln the hot and painful flesh Rose round the tighten'd Ring. The baffled Sorcerer knew the hand of Heaven, And inwardly blasphemed. 17. Ere long Lobaba's heart, Fruitful in wiles, devised new stratagem. A mist arose at noon, Like the loose hanging skirts Of some low cloud that, by the breeze impell'd, Sweeps o'er the mountain side. With joy the thoughtless youth That grateful shadowing hail'd; For grateful was the shade, While through the silver-lighted haze, Guiding their way, appear'd the beamless Sun. But soon that beacon fail'd; A heavier mass of cloud, Impenetrably deep, Hung o'er the wilderness. “Knowest thou the track?” quoth Thalaba, “Or should we pause, and wait the wind To scatter this bewildering fog?” The Sorcerer answer'd him, “Now let us hold right on,..for if we stray, The Sun to-morrow will direct our course.” So saying, he toward the desert depths Misleads the youth deceived. 18. Earlier the night came on, Nor moon, nor stars, were visible in heaven; And when at morn the youth unclosed his eyes, He knew not where to turn his face in prayer. “What shall we do?” Lobaba cried, “The lights of heaven have ceased To guide us on our way. Should we remain and wait More favourable skies, Soon would our food and water fail us here: And if we venture on, There are the dangers of the wilderness!” 19. “Sure it were best proceed!” The chosen youth replies; “So haply we may reach some tent, or grove Of dates, or station'd tribe. But idly to remain, Were yielding effortless, and waiting death.” The wily sorcerer willingly assents, And farther in the sands, Elate of heart, he leads the credulous youth. 20. Still o'er the wilderness Settled the moveless mist. The timid Antelope, that heard their steps, Stood doubtful where to turn in that dim light; The Ostrich, blindly hastening, met them full. At night, again in hope, Young Thalaba lay down; The morning came, and not one guiding ray Through the thick mist was visible, The same deep moveless mist that mantled all. 21. Oh for the Vulture's scream, Who haunts for prey the abode of humankind! Oh for the Plover's pleasant cry To tell of water near! Oh for the Camel-driver's song! For now the water-skin grows light, Though of the draught, more eagerly desired, Imperious prudence took with sparing thirst. Oft from the third night's broken sleep, As in his dreams he heard The sound of rushing winds, Started the anxious youth, and look'd abroad, In vain! for still the deadly calm endured. Another day pass'd on; The water-skin was drain'd; But then one hope arrived, For there was motion in the air! The sound of the wind arose anon, That scatter'd the thick mist, And lo! at length the lovely face of Heaven! 22. Alas!..a wretched scene Was open'd on their view. They look'd around, no wells were near, No tent, no human aid! Flat on the Camel lay the water-skin, And their dumb servant difficultly now, Over hot sands and under the hot sun, Dragg'd on with patient pain. 23. But oh the joy! the blessed sight! When in that burning waste the Travellers Saw a green meadow, fair with flowers besprent, Azure and yellow, like the beautiful fields Of England, when amid the growing grass The blue-bell bends, the golden king-cup shines, And the sweet cowslip scents the genial air, In the merry month of May! Oh joy! the Travellers Gaze on each other with hope-brighten'd eyes, For sure through that green meadow flows The living stream! And lo! their famish'd beast Sees the restoring sight! Hope gives his feeble limbs a sudden strength, He hurries on!... 24. The herbs so fair to eye Were Senna, and the Gentian's blossom blue, And kindred plants, that with unwater'd root Fed in the burning sand, whose bitter leaves Even frantic Famine loathed. 25. In uncommunicating misery Silent they stood. At length Lobaba said, “Son, we must slay the Camel, or we die For lack of water! thy young hand is firm,.. Draw forth the knife and pierce him!” Wretch accurst! Who that beheld thy venerable face, Thy features stiff with suffering, the dry lips, The feverish eyes, could deem that all within Was magic ease, and fearlessness secure, And wiles of hellish import? The young man Paused with reluctant pity: but he saw His comrade's red and painful countenance, And his own burning breath came short and quick, And at his feet the gasping beast Lies, over-worn with want. 26. Then from his girdle Thalaba took the knife With stern compassion, and from side to side Across the Camel's throat, Drew deep the crooked blade. Servant of man, that merciful deed For ever ends thy suffering; but what doom Waits thy deliverer? “Little will thy death Avail us!” thought the youth, As in the water-skin he pour'd The Camel's hoarded draught; It gave a scant supply, The poor allowance of one prudent day. 27. Son of Hodeirah, though thy steady soul Despair'd not, firm in faith, Yet not the less did suffering nature feel It's pangs and trials. Long their craving thirst Struggled with fear, by fear itself inflamed; But drop by drop, that poor, That last supply is drain'd. Still the same burning sun! no cloud in heaven! The hot air quivers, and the sultry mist Floats o'er the desert, with a show Of distant waters, mocking their distress. 28. The youth's parch'd lips were black, His tongue was dry and rough, His eye-balls red with heat. Lobaba gazed on him with looks That seem'd to speak of pity, and he said, “Let me behold thy Ring; It may have virtue that can save us yet!” With that he took his hand And view'd the writing close, Then cried with sudden joy, “It is a stone that whoso bears, The Genii must obey! Now raise thy voice, my Son, And bid them in His name that here is written Preserve us in our need.” 29. “Nay!” answer'd Thalaba, “Shall I distrust the providence of God? Is it not He must save? If Allah wills it not, Vain were the Genii's aid.” 30. Whilst he spake, Lobaba's eye, Upon the distance fix'd, Attended not his speech. Its fearful meaning drew The looks of Thalaba; Columns of sand came moving on, Red in the burning ray, Like obelisks of fire, They rush'd before the driving wind. Vain were all thoughts of flight! They had not hoped escape, Could they have back'd the Dromedary then, Who in his rapid race Gives to the tranquil air a drowning force. 31. High..high in heaven upcurl'd The dreadful sand-spouts moved; Swift as the whirlwind that impell'd their way, They came toward the travellers! The old Magician shriek'd, And lo! the foremost bursts, Before the whirlwind's force, Scattering afar a burning shower of sand. “Now by the virtue of the Ring, Save us!” Lobaba cried, “While yet thou hast the power, Save us! O save us! now!” The youth made no reply, Gazing in aweful wonder on the scene. 32. “Why dost thou wait?” the Old Man exclaim'd, “If Allah and the Prophet will not save, Call on the Powers that will!” 33. “Ha! do I know thee, Infidel accurst?” Exclaim'd the awaken'd youth. “And thou hast led me hither, Child of Sin! That fear might make me sell My soul to endless death!” 34. “Fool that thou art!” Lobaba cried, “Call upon Him whose name Thy charmed signet bears, Or die the death thy foolishness deserves!” 35. “Servant of Hell! die thou!” quoth Thalaba. And leaning on his bow He fitted the loose string, And laid the arrow in its resting-place. “Bow of my Father, do thy duty now!” He drew the arrow to its point, True to his eye it fled, And full upon the breast It smote the Sorcerer. Astonish'd Thalaba beheld The blunted point recoil. 36. A proud and bitter smile Wrinkled Lobaba's cheek. “Try once again thine earthly arms!” he cried. “Rash Boy! the Power I serve Abandons not his votaries. It is for Allah's wretched slaves, like thou, To serve a master, who in the hour of need Forsakes them to their fate! I leave thee!”..and he shook his staff, and call'd The Chariot of his charms. 37. Swift as the viewless wind Self-moved, the Chariot came; The Sorcerer mounts the seat. “Yet once more weigh thy danger!” he resumed, “Ascend the car with me, And with the speed of thought We pass the desert bounds.” The indignant youth vouchsafed not to reply, And lo! the magic car begins its course! 38. Hark! hark!..he shrieks..Lobaba shrieks! What, wretch, and hast thou raised The rushing terrors of the Wilderness To fall on thine own head? Death! death! inevitable death! Driven by the breath of God, A column of the Desert met his way. THE FIFTH BOOK. Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. Psalm xviii. 39. 1. When Thalaba from adoration rose, The air was cool, the sky With welcome clouds o'ercast, Which soon came down in rain. He lifted up his fever'd face to heaven, And bared his head and stretch'd his hands To that delightful shower, And felt the coolness permeate every limb, Freshening his powers of life. 2. A loud quick panting! Thalaba looks up, He starts, and his instinctive hand Grasps the knife hilt; for close beside A Tiger passes him. An indolent and languid eye The passing Tiger turn'd; His head was hanging down, His dry tongue lolling low, And the short panting of his breath Came through his hot parch'd nostrils painfully. The young Arabian knew The purport of his hurried pace, And following him in hope, Saw joyful from afar The Tiger stoop and drink. 3. A desert Pelican had built her nest In that deep solitude, And now, return'd from distant flight, Fraught with the river-stream, Her load of water had disburthen'd there. Her young in the refreshing bath Dipt down their callow heads, Fill'd the swoln membrane from their plumeless throat Pendant, and bills yet soft; And buoyant with arch'd breast, Plied in unpractised stroke The oars of their broad feet. They, as the spotted prowler of the wild Laps the cool wave, around their mother crowd, And nestle underneath her outspread wings. The spotted prowler of the wild Lapt the cool wave, and satiate, from the nest, Guiltless of blood, withdrew. 4. The mother-bird had moved not, But cowering o'er her nestlings, Sate confident and fearless, And watch'd the wonted guest. But when the human visitant approach'd, The alarmed Pelican Retiring from that hostile shape Gathers her young, and menaces with wings, And forward thrusts her threatening neck, Its feathers ruffling in her wrath, Bold with maternal fear. Thalaba drank, and in the water-skin Hoarded the precious element. Not all he took, but in the large nest left Store that sufficed for life; And journeying onward, blest the Carrier Bird, And blest, in thankfulness, Their common Father, provident for all. 5. With strength renew'd, and confident in faith, The son of Hodeirah proceeds; Till after the long toil of many a day, At length Bagdad appear'd, The City of his search. He hastening to the gate, Roams o'er the city with insatiate eyes; Its thousand dwellings, o'er whose level roofs Fair cupolas appear'd, and high-domed mosques, And pointed minarets, and cypress groves Every where scatter'd in unwithering green. 6. Thou too art fallen, Bagdad! City of Peace, Thou too hast had thy day; And loathsome Ignorance and brute Servitude, Pollute thy dwellings now, Erst for the Mighty and the Wise renown'd. O yet illustrious for remember'd fame,— Thy founder the Victorious,—and the pomp Of Haroun, for whose name by blood defiled, Yahia's, and the blameless Barmecides', Genius hath wrought salvation,—and the years When Science with the good Al-Maimon dwelt: So one day may the Crescent from thy Mosques Be pluck'd by Wisdom, when the enlighten'd arm Of Europe conquers to redeem the East! 7. Then Pomp and Pleasure dwelt within her walls; The Merchants of the East and of the West Met in her arch'd Bazars; All day the active poor Shower'd a cool comfort o'er her thronging streets; Labour was busy in her looms; Through all her open gates Long troops of laden Camels lined the roads, And Tigris bore upon his tameless stream Armenian harvests to her multitudes. 8. But not in sumptuous Caravansery The adventurer idles there, Nor satiates wonder with her pomp and wealth; A long day's distance from the walls Stands ruined Babylon; The time of action is at hand; The hope that for so many a year Hath been his daily thought, his nightly dream, Stings to more restlessness. He loaths all lingering that delays the hour When, full of glory, from his quest return'd, He on the pillar of the Tent beloved Shall hang Hodeirah's sword. 9. The many-coloured domes Yet wore one dusky hue; The Cranes upon the Mosque Kept their night-clatter still; When through the gate the early Traveller past. And when at evening o'er the swampy plain The Bittern's boom came far, Distinct in darkness seen Above the low horizon's lingering light, Rose the near ruins of old Babylon. 10. Once from her lofty walls the Charioteer Look'd down on swarming myriads; once she flung Her arches o'er Euphrates' conquer'd tide, And through her brazen portals when she pour'd Her armies forth, the distant nations look'd As men who watch the thunder-cloud in fear, Lest it should burst above them. She was fallen, The Queen of cities, Babylon, was fallen! Low lay her bulwarks; the black Scorpion bask'd In the palace courts; within the sanctuary The She-Wolf hid her whelps. Is yonder huge and shapeless heap, what once Hath been the aërial Gardens, height on height Rising like Media's mountains crown'd with wood, Work of imperial dotage? Where the fane Of Belus? Where the Golden Image now, Which at the sound of dulcimer and lute, Cornet and sacbut, harp and psaltery, The Assyrian slaves adored? A labyrinth of ruins, Babylon Spreads o'er the blasted plain: The wandering Arab never sets his tent Within her walls; the Shepherd eyes afar Her evil towers, and devious drives his flock. Alone unchanged, a free and bridgeless tide, Euphrates rolls along, Eternal Nature's work. 11. Through the broken portal, Over weedy fragments, Thalaba went his way. Cautious he trod, and felt The dangerous ground before him with his bow. The Jackal started at his steps; The Stork, alarm'd at sound of man, From her broad nest upon the old pillar top, Affrighted fled on flapping wings; The Adder, in her haunts disturb'd, Lanced at the intruding staff her arrowy tongue. 12. Twilight and moonshine dimly mingling gave An aweful light obscure, Evening not wholly closed, The Moon still pale and faint: An aweful light obscure, Broken by many a mass of blackest shade; Long column stretching dark through weeds and moss, Broad length of lofty wall, Whose windows lay in light, And of their former shape, low arch'd or square, Rude outline on the earth Figured, with long grass fringed. 13. Reclined against a column's broken shaft, Unknowing whitherward to bend his way, He stood, and gazed around. The Ruins closed him in; It seem'd as if no foot of man For ages had intruded there. 14. Soon at approaching step Startling, he turn'd and saw A Warrior in the moon-beam drawing near Forward the Stranger came, And with a curious eye Perused the Arab youth. 15. “And who art thou,” the Stranger cried, “That at an hour like this Wanderest in Babylon? A way-bewilder'd traveller, seekest thou The ruinous shelter here? Or comest thou to hide The plunder of the night? Or hast thou spells to make These ruins, yawning from their rooted base, Disclose their secret wealth?” 16. The youth replied, “Nor wandering traveller, Nor robber of the night, Nor skill'd in spells am I. I seek the Angels here, Haruth and Maruth. Stranger, in thy turn, Why wanderest thou in Babylon, And who art thou, the questioner?” 17. The man was fearless, and the temper'd pride Which toned the voice of Thalaba Displeased not him, himself of haughty heart. Heedless he answered, “Knowest thou Their cave of punishment?” 18. THALABA. Vainly I seek it. STRANGER. Art thou firm of foot To tread the ways of danger? THALABA. Point the path! STRANGER. Young Arab! if thou hast a heart can beat Evenly in danger; if thy bowels yearn not With human fears, at scenes where undisgraced The soldier tried in battle might look back And tremble, follow me!..for I am bound Into that cave of horrors. 19. Thalaba gazed on his comrade: he was young, of port Stately and strong; belike his face had pleased A woman's eye; but the youth read in it Unrestrain'd passions, the obdurate soul Bold in all evil daring; and it taught, By Nature's irresistible instinct, doubt Well-timed and wary. Of himself assured, Fearless of man, and firm in faith, “Lead on!” cried Thalaba. Mohareb led the way; And through the ruin'd streets, And through the farther gate, They pass'd in silence on. 20. What sound is borne on the wind? Is it the storm that shakes The thousand oaks of the forest? But Thalaba's long locks Flow down his shoulders moveless, and the wind In his loose mantle raises not a fold. Is it the river's roar Dash'd down some rocky descent? Along the level plain Euphrates glides unheard. What sound disturbs the night, Loud as the summer forest in the storm, As the river that roars among rocks? 21. And what the heavy cloud That hangs upon the vale, Thick as the mist o'er a well-water'd plain Settling at evening when the cooler air Lets its day-vapours fall; Black as the sulphur-cloud, That through Vesuvius, or from Hecla's mouth, Rolls up, ascending from the infernal fires. 22. From Ait's bitumen-lake That heavy cloud ascends; That everlasting roar From where its gushing springs Boil their black billows up. Silent the Arabian youth, Along the verge of that wide lake, Follow'd Mohareb's way, Toward a ridge of rocks that bank'd its side. There from a cave, with torrent force, And everlasting roar, The black bitumen roll'd. The moonlight lay upon the rocks; Their crags were visible, The shade of jutting cliffs, And where broad lichens whiten'd some smooth spot, And where the ivy hung Its flowing tresses down. A little way within the cave The moonlight fell, glossing the sable tide That gush'd tumultuous out. A little way it entered, then the rock Arching its entrance, and the winding way, Darken'd the unseen depths. 23. No eye of mortal man, If unenabled by enchanted spell, Had pierced those fearful depths; For mingling with the roar Of the portentous torrent, oft were heard Shrieks, and wild yells that scared The brooding Eagle from her midnight nest. The affrighted countrymen Call it the Mouth of Hell; And ever when their way leads near, They hurry with averted eyes, And dropping their beads fast, Pronounce the Holy Name. 24. There pausing at the cavern-mouth, Mohareb turn'd to Thalaba: “Now darest thou enter in?” “Behold!” the youth replied, And leading in his turn the dangerous way, Set foot within the cave. 25. “Stay, Madman!” cried his comrade: “Wouldst thou rush Headlong to certain death? Where are thine arms to meet The Keeper of the Passage?” A loud shriek, That shook along the windings of the cave, Scatter'd the youth's reply. 26. Mohareb, when the long re-echoing ceased, Exclaim'd, “Fate favour'd thee, Young Arab! when she wrote upon thy brow The meeting of to-night; Else surely had thy name This hour been blotted from the Book of Life!” 27. So saying, from beneath His cloak a bag he drew: “Young Arab! thou art brave,” he cried, “But thus to rush on danger unprepared, As lions spring upon the hunter's spear, Is blind, brute courage. Zohak keeps the cave Against that Giant of primeval days: No force can win the passage.” Thus he said, And from his wallet drew a human hand, Shrivell'd and dry and black; And fitting as he spake A taper in its hold, Pursued: “A murderer on the stake had died; I drove the Vulture from his limbs, and lopt The hand that did the murder, and drew up The tendon-strings to close its grasp, And in the sun and wind Parch'd it, nine weeks exposed. The Taper,..but not here the place to impart, Nor hast thou undergone the rites, That fit thee to partake the mystery. Look! it burns clear, but with the air around, Its dead ingredients mingle deathiness. This when the Keeper of the Cave shall feel, Maugre the doom of Heaven, The salutary spell Shall lull his penal agony to sleep, And leave the passage free.” 28. Thalaba answer'd not. Nor was there time for answer now, For lo! Mohareb leads, And o'er the vaulted cave, Trembles the accursed taper's feeble light. There where the narrowing chasm Rose loftier in the hill, Stood Zohak, wretched man, condemn'd to keep His Cave of punishment. His was the frequent scream Which when far off the prowling Jackal heard, He howl'd in terror back: For from his shoulders grew Two snakes of monster size, Which ever at his head Aim'd their rapacious teeth To satiate raving hunger with his brain. He, in the eternal conflict, oft would seize Their swelling necks, and in his giant grasp Bruise them, and rend their flesh with bloody nails, And howl for agony, Feeling the pangs he gave, for of himself Co-sentient and inseparable parts, The snaky torturers grew. 29. To him approaching now, Mohareb held the wither'd arm, The taper of enchanted power. The unhallow'd spell in hand unholy held, Then minister'd to mercy; heavily The wretch's eyelids closed; And welcome and unfelt, Like the release of death, A sudden sleep surprised his vital powers. 30. Yet though along the cave relax'd Lay Zohak's giant limbs, The twin-born serpents kept the narrow pass, Kindled their fiery eyes, Darted their tongues of terror, and roll'd out Their undulating length, Like the long streamers of some gallant ship Buoy'd on the wavy air, Still struggling to flow on, and still withheld. The scent of living flesh Inflamed their appetite. 31. Prepared for all the perils of the cave, Mohareb came. He from his wallet drew Two human heads, yet warm. O hard of heart! whom not the visible power Of retributive Justice, and the doom Of Zohak in his sight, Deterr'd from equal crime! Two human heads, yet warm, he laid Before the scaly guardians of the pass; They to their wonted banquet of old years Turn'd eager, and the narrow pass was free. 32. And now before their path The opening cave dilates; They reach a spacious vault, Where the black river-fountains burst their way. Now as a whirlwind's force Had center'd on the spring, The gushing flood roll'd up; And now the deaden'd roar Echoed beneath, collapsing as it sunk Within a dark abyss, Adown whose fathomless gulphs the eye was lost. 33. Blue flames that hover'd o'er the springs Flung through the cavern their uncertain light; Now waving on the waves they lay, And now their fiery curls Flow'd in long tresses up, And now contracting, glow'd with whiter heat: Then up they shot again, Darting pale flashes through the tremulous air; The flames, the red and yellow sulphur-smoke, And the black darkness of the vault, Commingling indivisibly. 34. “Here,” quoth Mohareb, “do the Angels dwell, The Teachers of Enchantment.” Thalaba Then raised his voice, and cried, “Haruth and Maruth, hear me! Not with rites Accursed, to disturb your penitence, And learn forbidden lore, Repentant Angels, seek I your abode; But sent by Allah and the Prophet here, Obediently I come, Their chosen servant I, Tell me the Talisman”— 35. “And dost thou think,” Mohareb cried, as with a smile of scorn He glanced upon his comrade, “dost thou think To trick them of their secret? For the dupes Of human-kind keep this lip-righteousness! 'Twill serve thee in the Mosque And in the Market-place, But Spirits view the heart. Only by strong and torturing spells enforced, Those stubborn angels teach the charm By which we must descend.” 36. “Descend?” said Thalaba. But then the wrinkling smile Forsook Mohareb's cheek, And darker feelings settled on his brow. “Now by my soul,” quoth he, “and I believe, Idiot! that I have led Some camel-kneed prayer-monger through the cave! What brings thee hither? Thou should'st have a hut By some Saint's grave beside the public way, There to less-knowing fools Retail thy Koran-scraps, And in thy turn, die civet-like at last In the dung-perfume of thy sanctity!.. Ye whom I seek! that, led by me, Feet uninitiate tread Your threshold, this atones!— Fit sacrifice he falls!” And forth he flash'd his scymetar, And raised the murderous blow. 37. There ceased his power; his lifted arm, Suspended by the spell, Hung impotent to strike. “Poor hypocrite!” cried he, “And this then is thy faith In Allah and the Prophet! They had fail'd To save thee, but for Magic's stolen aid: Yea, they had left thee yonder Serpent's meal, But that, in prudent cowardice, The chosen Servant of the Lord came in, Safe follower of my path!” 38. “Blasphemer! dost thou boast of guiding me?” Quoth Thalaba, with virtuous pride inflamed, “Blindly the wicked work The righteous will of Heaven! Sayest thou that diffident of God, In Magic spells I trust? Liar! let witness this!” And he drew off Abdaldar's Ring, And cast it in the gulph. A skinny hand came up, And caught it as it fell, And peals of devilish laughter shook the Cave. 39. Then joy suffused Mohareb's cheek, And Thalaba beheld The blue blade gleam, descending to destroy. 40. The undefended youth Sprung forward, and he seized Mohareb in his grasp, And grappled with him breast to breast. Sinewy and large of limb Mohareb was, Broad-shoulder'd, and his joints Knit firm, and in the strife Of danger practised well. Time had not thus matured young Thalaba; But high-wrought feeling now, The inspiration and the mood divine, Infused a force portentous, like the strength Of madness through his frame. Mohareb reels before him; he right on, With knee, with breast, with arm, Presses the staggering foe; And now upon the brink Of that tremendous spring,.. There with fresh impulse and a rush of force, He thrust him from his hold. The upwhirling flood received Mohareb, then, absorb'd, Engulph'd him in the abyss. 41. Thalaba's breath came fast, And panting, he breathed out A broken prayer of thankfulness. At length he spake and said, “Haruth and Maruth! are ye here? Or hath that evil guide misled my search? I, Thalaba, the Servant of the Lord, Invoke you. Hear me, Angels! so may Heaven Accept and mitigate your penitence. I go to root from earth the Sorcerer brood, Tell me the needful Talisman!” 42. Thus as he spake, recumbent on the rock Beyond the black abyss, Their forms grew visible. A settled sorrow sate upon their brows,.. Sorrow alone, for trace of guilt and shame None now remain'd; and gradual as by prayer The sin was purged away, Their robe of glory, purified of stain, Resumed the lustre of its native light. 43. In awe the youth received the answering voice, “Son of Hodeirah! thou hast proved it here; The Talisman is Faith.” THE SIXTH BOOK. Then did I see a pleasant Paradise, Full of sweet flowers and daintiest delights, Such as on earth man could not more devise With pleasures choice to feed his cheerful sprights; Not that which Merlin by his magic slights Made for the gentle squire to entertain His fair Belphœbe, could this garden stain. Spenser. Ruins of Time. 1. So from the inmost cave Did Thalaba retrace The windings of the rock. Still on the ground the giant limbs Of Zohak lay dispread; The spell of sleep had ceased, And his broad eyes were glaring on the youth: Yet raised he not his arm to bar the way, Fearful to rouse the snakes Now lingering o'er their meal. 2. Oh then, emerging from that dreadful cave, How grateful did the gale of night Salute his freshen'd sense! How full of lightsome joy, Thankful to Heaven, he hastens by the verge Of that bitumen-lake, Whose black and heavy fumes, Surge heaving after surge, Roll'd like the billowy and tumultuous sea. 3. The song of many a bird at morn Aroused him from his rest. Lo! at his side a courser stood; More animate of eye, Of form more faultless never had he seen, More light of limbs and beautiful in strength, Among the race whose blood, Pure and unmingled, from the royal steeds Of Solomon came down. 4. The chosen Arab's eye Glanced o'er his graceful shape, His rich caparisons, His crimson trappings gay. But when he saw the mouth Uncurb'd, the unbridled neck, Then his heart leapt, and then his cheek was flush'd; For sure he deem'd that Heaven had sent A courser, whom no erring hand might guide. And lo! the eager Steed Throws his head and paws the ground, Impatient of delay! Then up leapt Thalaba, And away went the self-govern'd courser. 5. Over the plain Away went the steed; With the dew of the morning his fetlocks were wet, The foam froth'd his limbs in the journey of noon, Nor stay'd he till over the westerly heaven The shadows of evening had spread. Then on a shelter'd bank The appointed Youth reposed, And by him laid the docile courser down. Again in the grey of the morning Thalaba bounded up; Over hill, over dale, Away goes the steed. Again at eve he stops, Again the Youth alights; His load discharged, his errand done, The courser then bounded away. 6. Heavy and dark the eve; The Moon was hid on high, A dim light tinged the mist That crost her in the path of Heaven. All living sounds had ceased, Only the flow of waters near was heard, A low and lulling melody. 7. Fasting, yet not of want Percipient, he on that mysterious steed Had reach'd his resting-place, For expectation kept his nature up. Now as the flow of waters near Awoke a feverish thirst, Led by the sound he moved To seek the grateful wave. 8. A meteor in the hazy air Play'd before his path; Before him now it roll'd A globe of living fire; And now contracted to a steady light, As when the solitary hermit prunes His lamp's long undulating flame; And now its wavy point Up-blazing rose, like a young cypress tree Sway'd by the heavy wind; Anon to Thalaba it moved, And wrapt him in its pale innocuous fire; Now, in the darkness drown'd, Left him with eyes bedimm'd, And now, emerging, spread the scene to sight. 9. Led by the sound and meteor-flame, The Arabian youth advanced. Now to the nearest of the many rills He stoops; ascending steam Timely repels his hand, For from its source it sprung, a boiling tide. A second course with better hap he tries, The wave intensely cold Tempts to a copious draught. There was a virtue in the wave: His limbs, that stiff with toil Dragg'd heavy, from the copious draught received Lightness and supple strength. O'erjoyed, and weening the benignant Power, Who sent the reinless steed, Had blest these healing waters to his use, He laid him down to sleep, Lull'd by the soothing and incessant sound, The flow of many waters, blending oft With shriller tones and deep low murmurings, Which from the fountain caves In mingled melody Like faery music, heard at midnight, came. 10. The sounds which last he heard at night Awoke his recollection first at morn. A scene of wonders lay before his eyes. In mazy windings o'er the vale A thousand streamlets stray'd, And in their endless course Had intersected deep the stony soil, With labyrinthine channels islanding A thousand rocks, which seem'd Amid the multitudinous waters there Like clouds that freckle o'er the summer sky, The blue ethereal ocean circling each, And insulating all. 11. Those islets of the living rock Were of a thousand shapes, And Nature with her various tints Diversified anew their thousand forms; For some were green with moss, Some ruddier tinged, or grey, or silver-white, And some with yellow lichens glow'd like gold, Some sparkled sparry radiance to the sun. Here gush'd the fountains up, Alternate light and blackness, like the play Of sunbeams on a warrior's burnish'd arms. Yonder the river roll'd, whose ample bed, Their sportive lingerings o'er, Received and bore away the confluent rills. 12. This was a wild and wonderous scene, Strange and beautiful, as where By Oton-tala, like a sea of stars, The hundred sources of Hoangho burst. High mountains closed the vale, Bare rocky mountains, to all living things Inhospitable; on whose sides no herb Rooted, no insect fed, no bird awoke Their echoes, save the Eagle, strong of wing, A lonely plunderer, that afar Sought in the vales his prey. 13. Thither toward those mountains Thalaba Following, as he believed, the path prescribed By Destiny, advanced. Up a wide vale that led into their depths, A stony vale between receding heights Of stone, he wound his way. A cheerless place! the solitary Bee, Whose buzzing was the only sound of life, Flew there on restless wing, Seeking in vain one flower, whereon to fix. 14. Still Thalaba holds on; The winding vale now narrows on his view, And steeper of ascent, Rightward and leftward rise the rocks, And now they meet across the vale. Was it the toil of human hands Had hewn a passage in the rock, Through whose rude portal-way The light of heaven was seen? Rude and low the portal-way; Beyond, the same ascending straits Went winding up the wilds. 15. Still a bare, silent, solitary glen, A fearful silence, and a solitude That made itself be felt; And steeper now the ascent, A rugged path, that tired The straining muscles, toiling slowly up. At length again a rock Stretch'd o'er the narrow vale; There also had a portal-way been hewn, But gates of massy iron barr'd the pass, Huge, solid, heavy-hinged. 16. There hung a horn beside the gate, Ivory-tipt and brazen-mouth'd; He took the ivory tip, And through the brazen mouth he breathed; Like a long thunder-peal, From rock to rock rebounding rung the blast; The gates of iron, by no human arm Unfolded, turning on their hinges slow, Disclosed the passage of the rock. He enter'd, and the iron gates fell to, And with a clap like thunder closed him in. 17. It was a narrow winding way; Dim lamps suspended from the vault, Lent to the gloom an agitated light. Winding it pierced the rock, A long descending path By gates of iron closed; There also hung a horn beside Of ivory tip and brazen mouth; Again he took the ivory tip, And gave the brazen mouth its voice again. Not now in thunder spake the horn, But breathed a sweet and thrilling melody: The gates flew open, and a flood of light Rush'd on his dazzled eyes. 18. Was it to earthly Eden, lost so long, The fated Youth had found his wonderous way? But earthly Eden boasts No terraced palaces, No rich pavilions bright with woven gold, Like these that in the vale Rise amid odorous groves. The astonish'd Thalaba, Doubting as though an unsubstantial dream Beguiled him, closed his eyes, And open'd them again; And yet uncertified, He prest them close, and as he look'd around Question'd the strange reality again. He did not dream; They still were there, The glittering tents, The odorous groves, The gorgeous palaces. 19. And lo! a man, reverend in comely age, Advancing greets the youth. “Favour'd of Fortune,” thus he said, “go taste The joys of Paradise! The reinless steed that ranges o'er the world, Brings hither those alone for lofty deeds Mark'd by their horoscope; permitted thus A foretaste of the full beatitude, That in heroic acts they may go on More ardent, eager to return and reap Endless enjoyment here, their destined meed. Favour'd of Fortune thou, go taste The joys of Paradise!” 20. This said, he turn'd away, and left The Youth in wonder mute; For Thalaba stood mute, And passively received The mingled joy which flow'd on every sense. Where'er his eye could reach, Fair structures, rainbow-hued, arose; And rich pavilions through the opening woods Gleam'd from their waving curtains sunny gold; And winding through the verdant vale, Went streams of liquid light; And fluted cypresses rear'd up Their living obelisks; And broad-leav'd plane-trees in long colonnades O'er-arch'd delightful walks, Where round their trunks the thousand tendrill'd vine Wound up and hung the boughs with greenerwreaths, And clusters not their own. Wearied with endless beauty, did his eyes Return for rest? beside him teems the earth With tulips, like the ruddy evening streak'd; And here the lily hangs her head of snow; And here amid her sable cup Shines the red eye-spot, like one brightest star, The solitary twinkler of the night; And here the rose expands Her paradise of leaves. 21. Then on his ear what sounds Of harmony arose! Far music and the distance-mellow'd song From bowers of merriment; The waterfall remote; The murmuring of the leafy groves; The single nightingale Perch'd in the rosier by, so richly toned, That never from that most melodious bird, Singing a love-song to his brooding mate, Did Thracian shepherd by the grave Of Orpheus hear a sweeter melody; Though there the Spirit of the Sepulchre All his own power infuse, to swell The incense that he loves. 22. And oh! what odours the voluptuous vale Scatters from jasmine bowers, From yon rose wilderness, From cluster'd henna and from orange groves, That with such perfumes fill the breeze, As Peris to their Sister bear, When from the summit of some lofty tree She hangs encaged, the captive of the Dives. They from their pinions shake The sweetness of celestial flowers, And, as her enemies impure From that impervious poison far away Fly groaning with the torment, she the while Inhales her fragrant food. 23. Such odours flow'd upon the world, When at Mohammed's nuptials, word Went forth in Heaven, to roll The everlasting gates of Paradise Back on their living hinges, that its gales Might visit all below; the general bliss Thrill'd every bosom, and the family Of man, for once, partook one common joy. 24. Full of the bliss, yet still awake To wonder, on went Thalaba; On every side the song of mirth, The music of festivity, Invite the passing youth. Wearied at length with hunger and with heat, He enters in a banquet room, Where round a fountain brink, On silken carpets sate the festive train. Instant through all his frame Delightful coolness spread; The playing fount refresh'd The agitated air; The very light came cool'd through silvering panes Of pearly shell, like the pale moon-beam tinged; Or where the wine-vase fill'd the aperture, Rosy as rising morn, or softer gleam Of saffron, like the sunny evening mist: Through every hue, and streak'd by all, The flowing fountain play'd. Around the water-edge Vessels of wine, alternate placed, Ruby and amber, tinged its little waves. From golden goblets there The guests sate quaffing the delicious juice Of Shiraz' golden grape. 25. But Thalaba took not the draught; For rightly he knew had the Prophet forbidden That beverage, the mother of sins. Nor did the urgent guests Proffer a second time the liquid fire, When in the youth's strong eye they saw No moveable resolve. Yet not uncourteous, Thalaba Drank the cool draught of innocence, That fragrant from its dewy vase Came purer than it left its native bed; And he partook the odorous fruits, For all rich fruits were there; Water-melons rough of rind, Whose pulp the thirsty lip Dissolved into a draught; Pistachios from the heavy-cluster'd trees Of Malavert, or Haleb's fertile soil; And Casbin's luscious grapes of amber hue, That many a week endure The summer sun intense, Till by its powerful heat All watery particles exhaled, alone The strong essential sweetness ripens there. Here cased in ice the apricot, A topaz, crystal-set: Here, on a plate of snow, The sunny orange rests; And still the aloes and the sandal-wood, From golden censers, o'er the banquet room Diffuse their dying sweets. 26. Anon a troop of females form'd the dance, Their ancles bound with bracelet-bells, That made the modulating harmony. Transparent garments to the greedy eye Exposed their harlot limbs, Which moved, in every wanton gesture skill'd. 27. With earnest eyes the banqueters Fed on the sight impure; And Thalaba, he gazed, But in his heart he bore a talisman, Whose blessed alchemy To virtuous thoughts refined The loose suggestions of the scene impure. Oneiza's image swam before his sight, His own Arabian Maid. He rose, and from the banquet room he rush'd, Tears coursed his burning cheek; And nature for a moment woke the thought, And murmur'd, that, from all domestic joys Estranged, he wander'd o'er the world A lonely being, far from all he loved. Son of Hodeirah, not among thy crimes That momentary murmur shall be written! 28. From tents of revelry, From festal bowers, to solitude he ran; And now he came where all the rills Of that well-water'd garden in one tide Roll'd their collected waves. A straight and stately bridge Stretch'd its long arches o'er the ample stream. Strong in the evening and distinct its shade Lay on the watery mirror, and his eye Saw it united with its parent pile, One huge fantastic fabric. Drawing near, Loud from the chambers of the bridge below, Sounds of carousal came and song, And unveil'd women bade the advancing youth Come merry-make with them! Unhearing, or unheeding, he Past o'er with hurried pace, And sought the shade and silence of the grove. 29. Deserts of Araby! His soul return'd to you. He cast himself upon the earth, And closed his eyes and call'd The voluntary vision up. A cry, as of distress, Aroused him; loud it came and near! He started up, he strung his bow, He pluck'd an arrow forth. Again a shriek..a woman's shriek! And lo! she rushes through the trees, Her veil is rent, her garments torn! The ravisher follows close. “Prophet, save me! save me, God! Help! help me, man!” to Thalaba she cried; Thalaba drew the bow. The unerring arrow did its work of death. Then turning to the woman, he beheld His own Oneiza, his Arabian Maid. THE SEVENTH BOOK. Now all is done; bring home the Bride again, Bring home the triumph of our victory! Bring home with you the glory of her gain, With joyance bring her, and with jollity. Never had man more joyful day than this, Whom Heaven would heap with bliss. Spenser's Epithalamium. 1. From fear, and from amazement, and from joy, At length the Arabian Maid recovering speech, Threw around Thalaba her arms, and cried, “My father! O my father!”...Thalaba In wonder lost, yet fearing to enquire, Bent down his cheek on hers, And their tears met, and mingled as they fell. 2. ONEIZA. At night they seized me, Thalaba! in my sleep;.. Thou wert not near,..and yet when in their grasp I woke, my shriek of terror called on thee. My father could not save me,..an old man! And they were strong and many:..O my God, The hearts they must have had to hear his prayers, And yet to leave him childless! THALABA. We will seek him; We will return to Araby. ONEIZA. Alas! We should not find him, Thalaba! Our tent Is desolate! the wind hath heap'd the sands Within its door; the lizard's track is left Fresh on the untrodden dust; prowling by night The tyger as he passes, hears no breath Of man, and turns to search the vacancy. Alas! he strays a wretched wanderer Seeking his child! old man, he will not rest,.. He cannot rest,..his sleep is misery,.. His dreams are of my wretchedness, my wrongs. O Thalaba! this is a wicked place! Let us be gone! THALABA. But how to pass again The iron doors that opening at a breath Gave easy entrance? armies in their might Would fail to move those hinges for return. ONEIZA. But we can climb the mountains that shut in This dreadful garden. THALABA. Are Oneiza's limbs Equal to that long toil? ONEIZA. Oh I am strong, Dear Thalaba! for this..fear gives me strength, And you are with me! 3. So she took his hand, And gently drew him forward, and they went Toward the mountain chain. 4. It was broad moonlight, and obscure or lost The garden beauties lay, But the great boundary rose, distinctly mark'd. These were no little hills, No sloping uplands lifting to the sun Their vineyards, with fresh verdure, and the shade Of ancient woods, courting the loiterer To win the easy ascent: stone mountains these, Desolate rock on rock, The burthens of the earth, Whose snowy summits met the morning beam When night was in the vale, whose feet were fix'd In the world's foundations. Thalaba beheld The heights precipitous, Impending crags, rocks unascendible, And summits that had tired the eagle's wing; “There is no way!” he said; Paler Oneiza grew, And hung upon his arm a feebler weight. 5. But soon again to hope Revives the Arabian maid, As Thalaba imparts the sudden thought. “I past a river,” cried the youth, “A full and copious stream. The flowing waters cannot be restrain'd, And where they find or force their way, There we perchance may follow; thitherward The current roll'd along.” So saying, yet again in hope Quickening their eager steps, They turn'd them thitherward. 6. Silent and calm the river roll'd along, And at the verge arrived Of that fair garden, o'er a rocky bed Toward the mountain-base, Still full and silent, held its even way. But farther as they went its deepening sound Louder and louder in the distance rose, As if it forced its stream Struggling through crags along a narrow pass. And lo! where raving o'er a hollow course The ever-flowing flood Foams in a thousand whirlpools! There adown The perforated rock Plunge the whole waters; so precipitous, So fathomless a fall, That their earth-shaking roar came deaden'd up Like subterranean thunders. 7. “Allah save us!” Oneiza cried; “there is no path for man From this accursed place!” And as she spake, her joints Were loosen'd, and her knees sunk under her. “Cheer up, Oneiza!” Thalaba replied; “Be of good heart. We cannot fly The dangers of the place, But we can conquer them!” 8. And the young Arab's soul Arose within him; “What is he,” he cried, “Who hath prepared this garden of delight, And wherefore are its snares?” 9. The Arabian Maid replied, “The Women, when I enter'd, welcomed me To Paradise, by Aloadin's will Chosen, like themselves, a Houri of the Earth. They told me, credulous of his blasphemies, That Aloadin placed them to reward His faithful servants with the joys of Heaven. O Thalaba, and all are ready here To wreak his wicked will, and work all crimes! How then shall we escape?” 10. “Woe to him!” cried the Appointed, a stern smile Darkening with stronger shades his countenance; “Woe to him! he hath laid his toils To take the Antelope; The Lion is come in!” 11. She shook her head, “A Sorcerer he, And guarded by so many! Thalaba,.. And thou but one!” 12. He raised his hand to Heaven, “Is there not God, Oneiza? I have a Talisman, that, whoso bears, Him, nor the Earthly, nor the Infernal Powers Of Evil, can cast down. Remember, Destiny Hath mark'd me from mankind! Now rest in faith, and I will guard thy sleep!” 13. So on a violet bank The Arabian Maid laid down, Her soft cheek pillow'd upon moss and flowers. She lay in silent prayer, Till prayer had tranquillized her fears, And sleep fell on her. By her side Silent sate Thalaba, And gazed upon the Maid, And as he gazed, drew in New courage and intenser faith, And waited calmly for the eventful day. 14. Loud sung the Lark, the awaken'd Maid Beheld him twinkling in the morning light. And wish'd for wings and liberty like his. The flush of fear inflamed her cheek, But Thalaba was calm of soul, Collected for the work. He ponder'd in his mind How from Lobaba's breast His blunted arrow fell. Aloadin too might wear Spell perchance of equal power To blunt the weapon's edge. 15. Beside the river-brink Grew a young poplar, whose unsteady leaves Varying their verdure to the gale, With silver glitter caught His meditating eye. Then to Oneiza turn'd the youth, And gave his father's bow, And o'er her shoulders slung The quiver arrow-stored. “Me other weapon suits,” said he; “Bear thou the Bow: dear Maid, The days return upon me, when these shafts, True to thy guidance, from the lofty palm Brought down its cluster, and thy gladden'd eye, Exulting, turn'd to seek the voice of praise. Oh! yet again, Oneiza, we shall share Our desert-joys!” So saying, to the bank He moved, and stooping low, With double grasp, hand below hand, he clench'd, And from its watery soil Uptore the poplar trunk. 16. Then off he shook the clotted earth, And broke away the head And boughs, and lesser roots; And lifting it aloft, Wielded with able sway the massy club. “Now for this child of Hell!” quoth Thalaba; “Belike he shall exchange to-day His dainty Paradise For other dwelling, and its cups of joy For the unallayable bitterness Of Zaccoum's fruit accurst.” 17. With that the Arabian youth and maid Toward the centre of the garden went. It chanced that Aloadin had convoked The garden-habitants, And with the assembled throng Oneiza mingled, and the Appointed Youth. Unmark'd they mingled; or if one With busier finger to his neighbour notes The quiver'd Maid, “Haply,” he says, “Some daughter of the Homerites, Or one who yet remembers with delight Her native tents of Himiar.” “Nay!” rejoins His comrade, “a love-pageant! for the man Mimics with that fierce eye and knotty club Some savage lion-tamer; she forsooth Must play the heroine of the years of old!” 18. Radiant with gems upon his throne of gold Sate Aloadin; o'er the Sorcerer's head Hover'd a Bird, and in the fragrant air Waved his wide winnowing wings, A living canopy. Large as the hairy Cassowar Was that o'ershadowing Bird; So huge his talons, in their grasp The Eagle would have hung a helpless prey. His beak was iron, and his plumes Glitter'd like burnish'd gold, And his eyes glow'd, as though an inward fire Shone through a diamond orb. 19. The blinded multitude Adored the Sorcerer, And bent the knee before him, And shouted forth his praise; “Mighty art thou, the bestower of joy, The Lord of Paradise!” Then Aloadin rose and waved his hand. And they stood mute, and moveless, In idolizing awe. 20. “Children of Earth,” he said, “Whom I have guided here By easier passage than the gate of Death, The infidel Sultan, to whose lands My mountains stretch their roots, Blasphemes and threatens me. Strong are his armies, many are his guards, Yet may a dagger find him. Children of Earth, I tempt ye not With the vain promise of a bliss unseen, With tales of a hereafter Heaven, Whence never Traveller hath return'd! Have ye not tasted of the cup of joy That in these groves of happiness For ever over-mantling tempts The ever-thirsty lip? Who is there here that by a deed Of danger will deserve The eternal joys of actual Paradise?” 21. “I!” Thalaba exclaim'd; And springing forward, on the Sorcerer's head He dash'd his knotty club. 22. Aloadin fell not, though his skull Was shattered by the blow, For by some talisman His miserable life imprison'd still Dwelt in the body. The astonish'd crowd Stand motionless with fear, Expecting to behold Immediate vengeance from the wrath of Heaven. And lo! the Bird...the monster Bird, Soars up...then pounces down To seize on Thalaba! Now, Oneiza, bend the bow, Now draw the arrow home!... True fled the arrow from Oneiza's hand; It pierced the monster Bird, It broke the Talisman,... Then darkness cover'd all,... Earth shook, Heaven thunder'd, and amid the yells Of evil Spirits perished The Paradise of Sin. 23. At last the earth was still; The yelling of the Demons ceased; Opening the wreck and ruin to their sight, The darkness roll'd away. Alone in life, Amid the desolation and the dead, Stood the Destroyer and the Arabian Maid. They look'd around, the rocks were rent, The path was open, late by magic closed; Awe-struck and silent down the stony glen They wound their thoughtful way. 24. Amid the vale below Tents rose and streamers play'd And javelins sparkled to the sun; And multitudes encamp'd Swarm'd, far as eye could travel o'er the plain. There in his war-pavilion sate In council with his Chiefs The Sultan of the Land. Before his presence there a Captain led Oneiza and the Appointed Youth. 25. “Obedient to our Lord's command,” said he, “We past toward the mountains, and began The ascending strait; when suddenly Earth shook, And darkness, like the midnight, fell around, And fire and thunder came from Heaven, As though the Retribution-day were come. After the terror ceased, and when with hearts Somewhat assured, again we ventured on, This youth and woman met us on the way. They told us, that from Aloadin's hold They came, on whom the judgement stroke hath fallen, He and his sinful Paradise at once Destroy'd by them, the agents they of Heaven. Therefore I brought them hither to repeat The tale before thy presence; that as search Shall prove it false or faithful, to their merit Thou mayest reward them.” “Be it done to us,” Thalaba answer'd, “as the truth shall prove!” 26. The Sultan while he spake Fix'd on him the proud eye of sovereignty; “If thou hast play'd with us, By Allah and by Ali, Death shall seal The lying lips for ever! But if the thing Be as thou say'st, Arabian, thou shalt stand Next to ourself!”... Hark! while he speaks, the cry, The lengthening cry, the increasing shout Of joyful multitudes! Breathless and panting to the tent The bearer of good tidings comes, “O Sultan, live for ever! be thy foes Like Aloadin all! The wrath of God hath smitten him.” 27. Joy at the welcome tale Shone in the Sultan's cheek; “Array the Arabian in the robe Of honour,” he exclaim'd, “And place a chain of gold around his neck, And bind around his brow the diadem, And mount him on my steed of state, And lead him through the camp, And let the Heralds go before and cry, Thus shall the Sultan reward The man who serves him well!” 28. Then in the purple robe They vested Thalaba, And hung around his neck the golden chain, And bound his forehead with the diadem, And on the royal steed They led him through the camp, And Heralds went before and cried, “Thus shall the Sultan reward The man who serves him well!” 29. When from the pomp of triumph And presence of the King, Thalaba sought the tent allotted him, Thoughtful the Arabian Maid beheld His animated eye, His cheek inflamed with pride. “Oneiza!” cried the youth, “The King hath done according to his word, And made me in the land Next to himself be named!... But why that serious melancholy smile?... Oneiza, when I heard the voice that gave me Honour, and wealth, and fame, the instant thought Arose to fill my joy, that thou would'st hear The tidings, and be happy.” ONEIZA. Thalaba, Thou would'st not have me mirthful! Am I not An orphan,..among strangers? THALABA. But with me! ONEIZA. My Father!.. THALABA. Nay, be comforted! Last night To what wert thou exposed! in what a peril The morning found us!..safety, honour, wealth, These now are ours. This instant who thou wert The Sultan ask'd. I told him from our childhood We had been plighted;..was I wrong, Oneiza? And when he said with bounties he would heap Our nuptials,..wilt thou blame me if I blest His will, that bade me fix the marriage day!..... In tears, my love?.. ONEIZA. Remember, Destiny Hath mark'd thee from mankind! THALABA. Perhaps when Aloadin was destroy'd The mission ceased; and therefore Providence With its rewards and blessings strews my path Thus for the accomplish'd service. ONEIZA. Thalaba! THALABA. Or if haply not, yet whither should I go? Is it not prudent to abide in peace Till I am summon'd? ONEIZA. Take me to the Deserts! THALABA. But Moath is not there; and would'st thou dwell In a stranger's tent? thy father then might seek In long and fruitless wandering for his child. ONEIZA. Take me then to Mecca! There let me dwell a servant of the Temple. Bind thou thyself my veil,..to human eye It never shall be lifted. There, whilst thou Shalt go upon thine enterprize, my prayers, Dear Thalaba! shall rise to succour thee, And I shall live,..if not in happiness, Surely in hope. THALABA. Oh think of better things! The will of Heaven is plain: by wonderous ways It led us here, and soon the common voice Will tell what we have done, and how we dwell Under the shadow of the Sultan's wing; So shall thy father hear the fame, and find us What he hath wish'd us ever...Still in tears! Still that unwilling eye! nay..nay..Oneiza.. I dare not leave thee other than my own,.. My wedded wife. Honour and gratitude As yet preserve the Sultan from all thoughts That sin against thee; but so sure as Heaven Hath gifted thee above all other maids With loveliness, so surely would those thoughts Of wrong arise within the heart of Power. If thou art mine, Oneiza, we are safe, But else, there is no sanctuary could save. ONEIZA. Thalaba! Thalaba! 30. With song, with music, and with dance, The bridal pomp proceeds. Following the deep-veil'd Bride Fifty female slaves attend In costly robes that gleam With interwoven gold, And sparkle far with gems. An hundred slaves behind them bear Vessels of silver and vessels of gold, And many a gorgeous garment gay, The presents that the Sultan gave. On either hand the pages go With torches flaring through the gloom, And trump and timbrel merriment Accompanies their way; And multitudes with loud acclaim Shout blessings on the Bride. And now they reach the palace pile, The palace home of Thalaba, And now the marriage feast is spread, And from the finish'd banquet now The wedding guests are gone. 31. Who comes from the bridal chamber?.. It is Azrael, the Angel of Death. THE EIGHTH BOOK. Quas potius decuit nostro te inferre sepulchro Petronilla, tibi spargimus has lacrimas.

Go not among the Tombs, Old Man! There is a madman there. OLD MAN. Will he harm me if I go? WOMAN. Not he, poor miserable man! But 't is a wretched sight to see His utter wretchedness. For all day long he lies on a grave, And never is he seen to weep, And never is he heard to groan, Nor ever at the hour of prayer Bends his knee nor moves his lips. I have taken him food for charity, And never a word he spake; But yet so ghastly he look'd, That I have awaken'd at night With the dream of his ghastly eyes. Now, go not among the Tombs, Old Man! OLD MAN. Wherefore has the wrath of God So sorely stricken him? WOMAN. He came a stranger to the land, And did good service to the Sultan, And well his service was rewarded. The Sultan named him next himself, And gave a palace for his dwelling, And dower'd his bride with rich domains. But on his wedding night There came the Angel of Death. Since that hour, a man distracted Among the sepulchres he wanders. The Sultan, when he heard the tale, Said that for some untold crime Judgement thus had stricken him, And asking Heaven forgiveness That he had shown him favour, Abandon'd him to want. OLD MAN. A Stranger did you say? WOMAN. An Arab born, like you. But go not among the Tombs, For the sight of his wretchedness Might make a hard heart ache! OLD MAN. Nay, nay, I never yet have shunn'd A countryman in distress; And the sound of his dear native tongue May be like the voice of a friend. 2. Then to the Sepulchre Whereto she pointed him, Old Moath bent his way. By the tomb lay Thalaba, In the light of the setting eve; The sun, and the wind, and the rain, Had rusted his raven locks; His cheeks were fallen in, His face-bones prominent; Reclined against the tomb he lay, And his lean fingers play'd, Unwitting, with the grass that grew beside. 3. The Old Man knew him not, But drawing near him, said, “Countryman, peace be with thee!” The sound of his dear native tongue Awaken'd Thalaba; He raised his countenance, And saw the good Old Man, And he arose and fell upon his neck, And groan'd in bitterness. Then Moath knew the youth, And fear'd that he was childless; and he turn'd His asking eyes, and pointed to the tomb. “Old Man!” cried Thalaba, “Thy search is ended here!” 4. The father's cheek grew white, And his lip quiver'd with the misery; Howbeit, collectedly, with painful voice He answer'd, “God is good! His will be done!” 5. The woe in which he spake, The resignation that inspired his speech, They soften'd Thalaba. “Thou hast a solace in thy grief,” he cried, “A comforter within! Moath! thou seest me here, Deliver'd to the Evil Powers, A God-abandon'd wretch.” 6. The Old Man look'd at him incredulous. “Nightly,” the youth pursued, “Thy daughter comes to drive me to despair. Moath, thou thinkest me mad; But when the Cryer from the Minaret Proclaims the midnight hour, Hast thou a heart to see her?” 7. In the Meidan now The clang of clarions and of drums Accompanied the Sun's descent. “Dost thou not pray, my son?” Said Moath, as he saw The white flag waving on the neighbouring Mosque: Then Thalaba's eye grew wild, “Pray!” echoed he; “I must not pray!” And the hollow groan he gave Went to the Old Man's heart. And bowing down his face to earth, In fervent agony he call'd on God. 8. A night of darkness and of storms! Into the Chamber of the Tomb Thalaba led the Old Man, To roof him from the rain. A night of storms! the wind Swept through the moonless sky, And moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres; And in the pauses of its sweep They heard the heavy rain Beat on the monument above. In silence on Oneiza's grave Her Father and her husband sate. 9. The Cryer from the Minaret Proclaim'd the midnight hour. “Now, now!” cried Thalaba; And o'er the chamber of the tomb There spread a lurid gleam, Like the reflection of a sulphur fire; And in that hideous light Oneiza stood before them. It was She,.. Her very lineaments,..and such as death Had changed them, livid cheeks, and lips of blue; But in her eyes there dwelt Brightness more terrible Than all the loathsomeness of death. “Still art thou living, wretch?” In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba; “And must I nightly leave my grave To tell thee, still in vain, God hath abandon'd thee?” 10. “This is not she!” the Old Man exclaim'd; “A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!” And to the youth he held his lance; “Strike and deliver thyself!” “Strike her!” cried Thalaba, And, palsied of all power, Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form. “Yea, strike her!” cried a voice, whose tones Flow'd with such sudden healing through his soul, As when the desert shower From death deliver'd him; But unobedient to that well-known voice, His eye was seeking it, When Moath, firm of heart, Perform'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse He thrust his lance; it fell, And howling with the wound, Its fiendish tenant fled. A sapphire light fell on them, And garmented with glory, in their sight Oneiza's Spirit stood. 11. “O Thalaba!” she cried, “Abandon not thyself! Would'st thou for ever lose me?..O my husband, Go and fulfil thy quest, That in the Bowers of Paradise I may not look for thee In vain, nor wait thee long.” 12. To Moath then the Spirit Turn'd the dark lustre of her heavenly eyes: “Short is thy destined path, O my dear Father! to the abode of bliss. Return to Araby, There with the thought of death Comfort thy lonely age, And Azrael, the Deliverer, soon Will visit thee in peace.” 13. They stood with earnest eyes, And arms out-reaching, when again The darkness closed around them. The soul of Thalaba revived; He from the floor his quiver took, And as he bent the bow, exclaim'd, “Was it the over-ruling Providence That in the hour of frenzy led my hands Instinctively to this? To-morrow, and the sun shall brace anew The slacken'd cord, that now sounds loose and damp; To-morrow, and its livelier tone will sing In tort vibration to the arrow's flight. I..but I also, with recovered health Of heart, shall do my duty. My Father! here I leave thee then!” he cried, “And not to meet again, Till at the gate of Paradise The eternal union of our joys commence. We parted last in darkness!”...and the youth Thought with what other hopes; But now his heart was calm, For on his soul a heavenly hope had dawn'd. 14 The Old Man answered nothing, but he held His garment, and to the door Of the Tomb Chamber followed him. The rain had ceased, the sky was wild, Its black clouds broken by the storm. And, lo! it chanced, that in the chasm Of Heaven between, a star, Leaving along its path continuous light, Shot eastward. “See my guide!” quoth Thalaba; And turning, he received Old Moath's last embrace, And the last blessing of the good Old Man. 15 Evening was drawing nigh, When an old Dervise, sitting in the sun At his cell door, invited for the night The traveller; in the sun He spread the plain repast, Rice and fresh grapes, and at their feet there flow'd The brook of which they drank. 16. So as they sate at meal, With song, with music, and with dance, A wedding train went by; The deep-veil'd bride, the female slaves, The torches of festivity, And trump and timbrel merriment Accompanied their way. The good old Dervise gave A blessing as they past; But Thalaba look'd on, And breathed a low deep groan, and hid his face. The Dervise had known sorrow, and he felt Compassion; and his words Of pity and of piety Open'd the young man's heart, And he told all his tale. 17. “Repine not, O my Son!” the Old Man replied, “That Heaven hath chasten'd thee. Behold this vine, I found it a wild tree, whose wanton strength Had swoln into irregular twigs And bold excrescences, And spent itself in leaves and little rings, So in the flourish of its outwardness Wasting the sap and strength That should have given forth fruit. But when I pruned the plant, Then it grew temperate in its vain expense Of useless leaves, and knotted, as thou see'st, Into these full clear clusters, to repay The hand that wisely wounded it. Repine not, O my Son! In wisdom and in mercy Heaven inflicts Its painful remedies.” 18. Then pausing,..“Whither goest thou now?” he ask'd. “I know not,” answered Thalaba; “My purpose is to hold Straight on, secure of this, That travel where I will, I cannot stray, For Destiny will lead my course aright.” 19. “Far be from me,” the Old Man replied, “To shake that pious confidence; And yet, if knowledge may be gain'd, methinks Thy course should be to seek it painfully. In Kaf the Simorg hath his dwelling place, The all-knowing Bird of Ages, who hath seen The World, with all its children, thrice destroy'd. Long is the path, And difficult the way, of danger full; But that unerring Bird Could to a certain end Direct thy weary search.” 20. Easy assent the youth Gave to the words of wisdom; and behold At dawn, the adventurer on his way to Kaf. And he hath travelled many a day, And many a river swum over, And many a mountain ridge hath crost, And many a measureless plain; And now amid the wilds advanced, Long is it since his eyes Have seen the trace of man. 21. Cold! cold! 't is a chilly clime That the youth in his journey hath reach'd, And he is aweary now, And faint for lack of food. Cold! cold! there is no Sun in heaven, A heavy and uniform cloud Overspreads the face of the sky, And the snows are beginning to fall. Dost thou wish for thy deserts, O Son of Hodeirah? Dost thou long for the gales of Arabia? Cold! cold! his blood flows languidly, His hands are red, his lips are blue, His feet are sore with the frost. Cheer thee! cheer thee! Thalaba! A little yet bear up! 22. All waste! no sign of life But the track of the wolf and the bear! No sound but the wild, wild wind, And the snow crunching under his feet! Night is come; neither moon, nor stars, Only the light of the snow! But behold a fire in a cave of the hill, A heart-reviving fire; And thither with strength renew'd Thalaba presses on. 23. He found a Woman in the cave, A solitary Woman, Who by the fire was spinning, And singing as she spun. The pine boughs were cheerfully blazing, And her face was bright with the flame; Her face was as a Damsel's face, And yet her hair was grey. She bade him welcome with a smile, And still continued spinning, And singing as she spun. The thread the woman drew Was finer than the silkworm's, Was finer than the gossamer; The song she sung was low and sweet, But Thalaba knew not the words. 24. He laid his bow before the hearth, For the string was frozen stiff; He took the quiver from his neck, For the arrow-plumes were iced. Then as the cheerful fire Revived his languid limbs, The adventurer ask'd for food. The Woman answer'd him, And still her speech was song: “The She Bear she dwells near to me, And she hath cubs, one, two, and three; She hunts the deer, and brings him here, And then with her I make good cheer; And now to the chase the She Bear is gone, And she with her prey will be here anon.” 25. She ceased her spinning while she spake; And when she had answer'd him, Again her fingers twirl'd the thread, And again the Woman began, In low, sweet tones to sing The unintelligible song. 26. The thread she spun it gleam'd like gold In the light of the odorous fire, Yet was it so wonderously thin, That, save when it shone in the light, You might look for it closely in vain. The youth sate watching it, And she observed his wonder, And then again she spake, And still her speech was song; “Now twine it round thy hands I say, Now twine it round thy hands I pray; My thread is small, my thread is fine, But he must be A stronger than thee, Who can break this thread of mine!” 27. And up she raised her bright blue eyes, And sweetly she smiled on him, And he conceived no ill; And round and round his right hand, And round and round his left, He wound the thread so fine. And then again the Woman spake, And still her speech was song, “Now thy strength, O Stranger, strain! Now then break the slender chain.” 28. Thalaba strove, but the thread By magic hands was spun, And in his cheek the flush of shame Arose, commixt with fear. She beheld and laugh'd at him, And then again she sung, “My thread is small, my thread is fine, But he must be A stronger than thee, Who can break this thread of mine!” 29. And up she raised her bright blue eyes, And fiercely she smiled on him: “I thank thee, I thank thee, Hodeirah's son! I thank thee for doing what can't be undone, For binding thyself in the chain I have spun!” Then from his head she wrench'd A lock of his raven hair, And cast it in the fire, And cried aloud as it burnt, “Sister! Sister! hear my voice! Sister! Sister! come and rejoice! The thread is spun, The prize is won, The work is done, For I have made captive Hodeirah's Son.” 30. Borne in her magic car The Sister Sorceress came, Khawla, the fiercest of the Sorcerer brood. She gazed upon the youth, She bade him break the slender thread, She laugh'd aloud for scorn, She clapt her hands for joy. 31. The She Bear from the chase came in, She bore the prey in her bloody mouth, She laid it at Maimuna's feet, And then look'd up with wistful eyes As if to ask her share. “There! there!” quoth Maimuna, And pointing to the prisoner-youth, She spurn'd him with her foot, And bade her make her meal. But then their mockery fail'd them, And anger and shame arose; For the She Bear fawn'd on Thalaba, And quietly lick'd his hand. 32. The grey-hair'd Sorceress stampt the ground, And call'd a Spirit up; “Shall we bear the Enemy To the dungeon dens below?” SPIRIT. Woe! woe! to our Empire woe! If ever he tread the caverns below. MAIMUNA. Shall we leave him fetter'd here With hunger and cold to die? SPIRIT. Away from thy lonely dwelling fly! Here I see a danger nigh, That he should live and thou should'st die. MAIMUNA. Whither then must we bear the foe? SPIRIT. To Mohareb's island go, There shalt thou secure the foe, There prevent thy future woe. 33. Then in the Car they threw The fetter'd Thalaba, And took their seats, and set Their feet upon his neck; Maimuna held the reins, And Khawla shook the scourge, And away! away! away! 34. They were no steeds of mortal race That drew the magic car With the swiftness of feet and of wings. The snow-dust rises behind them, The ice-rock's splinters fly, And hark in the valley below The sound of their chariot wheels,.. And they are far over the mountains! Away! away! away! The Demons of the air Shout their joy as the Sisters pass, The Ghosts of the Wicked that wander by night Flit over the magic car. 35. Away! away! away! Over the hills and the plains, Over the rivers and rocks, Over the sands of the shore; The waves of ocean heave Under the magic steeds; With unwet hoofs they trample the deep, And now they reach the Island coast, And away to the city the Monarch's abodc. Open fly the city gates, Open fly the iron doors, The doors of the palace-court. Then stopt the charmed car. 36. The Monarch heard the chariot wheels, And forth he came to greet The mistress whom he served. He knew the captive youth, And Thalaba beheld Mohareb in the robes of royalty, Whom erst his arm had thrust Down the bitumen pit. THE NINTH BOOK. Conscience! ? Poor plodding Priests and preaching Friars may make Their hollow pulpits and the empty aisles Of churches ring with that round word: but we, That draw the subtile and more piercing air In that sublimed region of a court, Know all is good we make so, and go on Secured by the prosperity of our crimes. B. Jonson. Mortimer's Fall. 1. “Go up, my Sister Maimuna, Go up, and read the stars!” 2. Lo! on the terrace of the topmost tower She stands; her darkening eyes, Her fine face raised to Heaven; Her white hair flowing like the silver streams That streak the northern night. 3. They hear her coming tread, They lift their asking eyes: Her face is serious, her unwilling lips Slow to the tale of ill. “What hast thou read? what hast thou read?” Quoth Khawla in alarm. “Danger..death..judgement!” Maimuna replied. 4. “Is that the language of the lights of Heaven?” Exclaim'd the sterner Witch; “Creatures of Allah, they perform his will, And with their lying menaces would daunt Our credulous folly...Maimuna, I never liked this uncongenial lore! Better befits to make the Sacrifice Of Divination; so shall I Be mine own Oracle. Command the victims thou, O King! Male and female they must be, Thou knowest the needful rites. Meanwhile I purify the place.” 5. The Sultan went; the Sorceress rose, And North, and South, and East, and West, She faced the points of Heaven; And ever where she turn'd She laid her hand upon the wall; And up she look'd, and smote the air, And down she stoopt, and smote the floor. “To Eblis and his servants I consecrate the place; Let enter none but they! Whatever hath the breath of life, Whatever hath the sap of life, Let it be blasted and die!” 6. Now all is prepared; Mohareb returns, The Circle is drawn, The Victims have bled, The Youth and the Maid. She in the circle holds in either hand, Clench'd by the hair, a head, The heads of the Youth and the Maid. “Go out, ye lights!” quoth Khawla, And in darkness began the spell. 7. With spreading arms she whirls around Rapidly, rapidly, Ever around and around; And loudly she calls the while, “Eblis! Eblis!” Loudly, incessantly, Still she calls, “Eblis! Eblis!” Giddily, giddily, still she whirls, Loudly, incessantly, still she calls; The motion is ever the same, Ever around and around; The calling is still the same, Still it is, “Eblis! Eblis!” Till her voice is a shapeless yell, And dizzily rolls her brain, And now she is full of the Fiend. She stops, she rocks, she reels! Look! look! she appears in the darkness! Her flamy hairs curl up All living, like the Meteor's locks of light! Her eyes are like the sickly Moon! 8. It is her lips that move, Her tongue that shapes the sound; But whose is the Voice that proceeds?... “Ye may hope and ye may fear, The danger of his stars is near. Sultan! if he perish, woe! Fate hath written one death-blow For Mohareb and the Foe! Triumph! triumph! only she That knit his bonds can set him free.” 9. She spake the Oracle, And senselessly she fell. They knelt in care beside her,.. Her Sister and the King; They sprinkled her palms with water, They wetted her nostrils with blood. 10. She wakes as from a dream, She asks the utter'd voice; But when she heard, an anger and a grief Darken'd her wrinkling brow. “Then let him live in long captivity!” She answer'd: but Mohareb's quicken'd eye Perused her sullen countenance, That lied not with the lips. A miserable man! What boots it that in central caves, The Powers of Evil at his Baptism pledged The Sacrament of Hell? His death secures them now. What boots it that they gave Abdaldar's guardian ring, When, through another's life, The blow may reach his own? 11. He sought the dungeon cell Where Thalaba was laid. 'T was the grey morning twilight, and the voice Of Thalaba in prayer With words of hallow'd import smote his ear. The grating of the heavy hinge Roused not the Arabian youth; Nor lifted he his earthward face, At sound of coming feet. Nor did Mohareb with unholy speech Disturb the duty: silent, spirit-awed, Envious, heart-humbled, he beheld The peace which piety alone can give. 12. When Thalaba, the perfect rite perform'd, Raised his calm eye, then spake the Island-Chief: “Arab! my guidance through the dangerous Cave Thy service overpaid, An unintended friend in enmity. The Hand that caught thy ring Received and bore me to the scene I sought. Now know me grateful. I return That amulet, thy only safety here.” 13. Artful he spake, with show of gratitude Veiling the selfish deed. Lock'd in his magic chain, Thalaba on his passive powerless hand Received again the Spell. Remembering then with what an ominous faith First he drew on the ring, The youth repeats his words of augury; “In God's name and the Prophet's! be its power Good, let it serve the righteous! if for evil, God and my trust in Him shall hallow it. Blindly the wicked work The righteous will of Heaven!” So Thalaba received again The written ring of gold. 14. Thoughtful awhile Mohareb stood, And eyed the captive youth. Then, building skilfully sophistic speech, Thus he began. “Brave art thou, Thalaba! And wherefore are we foes?..for I would buy Thy friendship at a princely price, and make thee To thine own welfare wise. Hear me! in Nature are two hostile Gods, Makers and Masters of existing things, Equal in power:..nay, hear me patiently!.. Equal..for look around thee! The same Earth Bears fruit and poison; where the Camel finds His fragrant food, the horned Viper there Sucks in the juice of death: the Elements Now serve the use of man, and now assert Dominion o'er his weakness: dost thou hear The sound of merriment and nuptial song? From the next house proceeds the mourner's cry, Lamenting o'er the dead. Say'st thou that Sin Enter'd the world of Allah? that the Fiend, Permitted for a season, prowls for prey? When to thy tent the venomous serpent creeps, Dost thou not crush the reptile? Even so, Be sure, had Allah crush'd his Enemy, But that the power was wanting. From the first, Eternal as themselves their warfare is; To the end it must endure. Evil and Good.. What are they, Thalaba, but words? in the strife Of Angels, as of Men, the weak are guilty; Power must decide. The Spirits of the Dead Quitting their mortal mansion, enter not, As falsely ye are preach'd, their final seat Of bliss, or bale; nor in the sepulchre Sleep they the long, long sleep: each joins the host Of his great leader, aiding in the war Whose fate involves his own. Woe to the vanquish'd then! Woe to the sons of man who follow'd him! They, with their Leader, through eternity, Must howl in central fires. Thou, Thalaba, hast chosen ill thy part, If choice it may be call'd, where will was not, Nor searching doubt, nor judgement wise to weigh. Hard is the service of the Power, beneath Whose banners thou wert born; his discipline Severe, yea cruel; and his wages, rich Only in promise; who hath seen the pay? For us..the pleasures of the world are ours, Riches and rule, the kingdoms of the Earth. We met in Babylon adventurers both, Each zealous for the hostile Power he served: We meet again; thou feelest what thou art, Thou seest what I am, the Sultan here, The Lord of Life and Death. Abandon him who has abandon'd thee, And be, as I am, great among mankind!” 15. The Captive did not, hasty to confute, Break off that subtle speech; But when the expectant silence of the King Look'd for his answer, then spake Thalaba. “And this then is thy faith! this monstrous creed! This lie against the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, And Earth, and Heaven! Blind man, who canst not see How all things work the best! who wilt not know, That in the Manhood of the World, whate'er Of folly mark'd its Infancy, of vice Sullied its Youth, ripe Wisdom shall cast off, Stablish'd in good, and, knowing evil, safe. Sultan Mohareb, yes, ye have me here In chains; but not forsaken, though opprest; Cast down, but not destroy'd. Shall danger daunt, Shall death dismay his soul, whose life is given For God, and for his brethren of mankind? Alike rewarded, in that holy cause, The Conqueror's and the Martyr's palm above Beam with one glory. Hope ye that my blood Can quench the dreaded flame? and know ye not, That leagued against ye are the Just and Wise, And all Good Actions of all ages past, Yea, your own crimes, and Truth, and God in Heaven?” 16. “Slave!” quoth Mohareb, and his lip Quiver'd with eager wrath, “I have thee! thou shalt feel my power, And in thy dungeon loathsomeness Rot piece-meal, limb from limb!” And out the Tyrant rushes, And all impatient of the thoughts That canker'd in his heart, Seeks in the giddiness of boisterous sport Short respite from the avenging power within. 17. What Woman is she So wrinkled and old, That goes to the wood? She leans on her staff With a tottering step, She tells her bead-string slow Through fingers dull'd by age. The wanton boys bemock her; The babe in arms that meets her Turns round with quick affright And clings to his nurse's neck. 18. Hark! hark! the hunter's cry; Mohareb has gone to the chase. The dogs, with eager yelp, Are struggling to be free; The hawks in frequent stoop Token their haste for flight; And couchant on the saddle-bow, With tranquil eyes and talons sheathed, The ounce expects his liberty. 19. Propt on the staff that shakes Beneath her trembling weight, The Old Woman sees them pass. Halloa! halloa! The game is up! The dogs are loosed, The deer bounds over the plain: The dogs pursue Far, far behind, Though at full stretch, With eager speed, Far, far behind. But lo! the Falcon o'er his head Hovers with hostile wings, And buffets him with blinding strokes! Dizzy with the deafening strokes In blind and interrupted course, Poor beast, he struggles on; And now the dogs are nigh! How his heart pants! you see The panting of his heart; And tears like human tears Roll down, along the big veins fever-swoln; And now the death-sweat darkens his dun hide; His fear, his groans, his agony, his death, Are the sport, and the joy, and the triumph! 20. Halloa! another prey, The nimble Antelope! The ounce is freed; one spring, And his talons are sheathed in her shoulders, And his teeth are red in her gore. There came a sound from the wood, Like the howl of the winter wind at night, Around a lonely dwelling; The ounce, whose gums were warm in his prey, He hears the summoning sound. In vain his master's voice, No longer dreaded now, Calls and recalls with threatful tone; Away to the forest he goes; For that Old Woman had laid Her shrivell'd finger on her shrivell'd lips, And whistled with a long, long breath; And that long breath was the sound Like the howl of the winter wind at night, Around a lonely dwelling. 21. Mohareb knew her not, As to the chase he went, The glance of his proud eye Passing in scorn o'er age and wretchedness. She stands in the depth of the wood. And panting to her feet, Fawning and fearful, creeps The ounce by charms constrain'd. Well may'st thou fear, and vainly dost thou fawn! Her form is changed, her visage new, Her power, her art the same! It is Khawla that stands in the wood. 22. She knew the place where the Mandrake grew, And round the neck of the ounce, And round the Mandrake's head, She tightens the ends of her cord. Her ears are closed with wax, And her prest finger fastens them, Deaf as the Adder, when, with grounded head, And circled form, both avenues of sound Barr'd safely, one slant eye Watches the charmer's lips Waste on the wind his baffled witchery. The spotted ounce so beautiful, Springs forceful from the scourge: With that the dying plant all agony, Feeling its life-strings crack, Utter'd the unimaginable groan That none can hear and live. 23. Then from her victim servant Khawla loosed The precious poison. Next with naked hand, She pluck'd the boughs of the manchineel; And of the wormy wax she took, That, from the perforated tree forced out, Bewray'd its insect-parent's work within. 24. In a cavern of the wood she sits, And moulds the wax to human form; And, as her fingers kneaded it, By magic accents, to the mystic shape Imparted with the life of Thalaba, In all its passive powers, Mysterious sympathy. With the mandrake and the manchineel She builds her pile accurst. She lays her finger to the pile, And blue and green the flesh Glows with emitted fire, A fire to kindle that strange fuel meet. 25. Before the fire she placed the imaged wax: “There, waste away!” the Enchantress cried, “And with thee waste Hodeirah's Son!” 26. Fool! fool! go thaw the everlasting ice, Whose polar mountains bound the human reign. Blindly the wicked work The righteous will of Heaven! The doom'd Destroyer wears Abdaldar's ring; Against the danger of his horoscope Yourselves have shielded him; And on the sympathizing wax, The unadmitted flames play powerlessly, As the cold moon-beam on a plain of snow. 27. “Curse thee! curse thee!” cried the fiendly woman, “Hast thou yet a spell of safety?” And in the raging flames She threw the imaged wax. It lay amid the flames, Like Polycarp of old, When, by the glories of the burning stake O'er-vaulted, his grey hairs Curl'd, life-like, to the fire That haloed round his saintly brow. 28. “Wherefore is this!” cried Khawla, and she stampt Thrice on the cavern floor: “Maimuna! Maimuna!” Thrice on the floor she stampt, Then to the rocky gateway glanced Her eager eyes, and Maimuna was there. “Nay, Sister, nay!” quoth she, “Mohareb's life Is link'd with Thalaba's! Nay, Sister, nay! the plighted oath! The common sacrament!” 29. “Idiot!” said Khawla, “one must die, or all! Faith kept with him were treason to the rest. Why lies the wax like marble in the fire? What powerful amulet Protects Hodeirah's Son?” 30. Cold, marble-cold, the wax Lay on the raging pile, Cold in that white intensity of fire. The Bat, that with her hook'd and leathery wings Clung to the cave-roof, loosed her hold, Death-sickening with the heat; The Toad, which to the darkest nook had crawl'd, Panted fast with fever pain; The Viper from her nest came forth, Leading her quicken'd brood, That, sportive with the warm delight, roll'd out Their thin curls, tender as the tendril rings, Ere the green beauty of their brittle youth Grows brown, and toughens in the summer sun. Cold, marble-cold, the wax Lay on the raging pile, The silver quivering of the element O'er its pale surface shedding a dim gloss. 31. Amid the red and fiery smoke, Watching the portent strange, The blue-eyed Sorceress and her Sister stood, Seeming a ruined Angel by the side Of Spirit born in hell. Maimuna raised at length her thoughtful eyes: “Whence, Sister, was the wax? The work of the worm, or the bee? Nay then I marvel not! It were as wise to bring from Ararat The fore-world's wood to build the magic pile, And feed it from the balm bower, through whose veins The Martyr's blood sends such a virtue out That the fond mother from beneath its shade Wreathes the horn'd viper round her playful child. This is the eternal, universal strife! There is a Grave-wax,..I have seen the Gouls Fight for the dainty at their banqueting.”.. 32. “Excellent Witch!” quoth Khawla! and she went To the cave-arch of entrance, and scowl'd up, Mocking the blessed Sun: “Shine thou in Heaven, but I will shadow Earth! Thou wilt not shorten day, But I will hasten darkness!” Then the Witch Began a magic song, One long low tone, through teeth half-closed, Through lips slow-moving, muttered slow; One long-continued breath, Till to her eyes a darker yellowness Was driven, and fuller-swoln the prominent veins On her loose throat grew black. Then looking upward, thrice she breathed Into the face of Heaven; The baneful breath infected Heaven; A mildewing fog it spread Darker and darker; so the evening sun Pour'd his unentering glory on the mist, And it was night below. 33. “Bring now the wax,” quoth Khawla, “for thou know'st The mine that yields it.” Forth went Maimuna, In mist and darkness went the Sorceress forth; And she hath reach'd the Place of Tombs, And in their sepulchres the Dead Feel feet unholy trampling over them. 34. Thou startest, Maimuna, Because the breeze is in thy lifted locks! Is Khawla's spell so weak? Sudden came the breeze and strong; The heavy mist wherewith the lungs opprest Were labouring late, flies now before the gale, Thin as an infant's breath, Seen in the sunshine of an autumn frost. Sudden it came, and soon its work was done, And suddenly it ceased; Cloudless and calm it left the firmament, And beautiful in the blue sky Arose the summer Moon. 35. She heard the quicken'd action of her blood, She felt the fever in her cheeks. Daunted, yet desperate, in a tomb Entering, with impious hand she traced Circles and squares and trines And magic characters, Till, riven by her charms, the tomb Yawn'd and disclosed its dead; Maimuna's eyes were open'd, and she saw The secrets of the Grave. 36. There sate a Spirit in the vault, In shape, in hue, in lineaments, like life; And by him couch'd, as if intranced, The hundred-headed Worm that never dies. 37. “Nay, Sorceress! not to-night!” the Spirit cried, “The flesh in which I sinn'd may rest to-night From suffering; all things, even I, to-night, Even the Damn'd, repose!” 38. The flesh of Maimuna Crept on her bones with terror, and her knees Trembled with their trembling weight. “Only this Sabbath! and at dawn the Worm Will wake, and this poor flesh must grow to meet The gnawing of his hundred poison-mouths! God! God! is there no mercy after death!” 39. Soul-struck, she rush'd away, She fled the Place of Tombs, She cast herself upon the earth, All agony, and tumult, and despair. And in that wild and desperate agony Sure Maimuna had died the utter death, If aught of evil had been possible On this mysterious night; For this was that most holy night When all Created Things adore The Power that made them; Insects, Beasts, and Birds, The Water-Dwellers, Herbs, and Trees, and Stones, Yea, Earth and Ocean, and the infinite Heaven, With all its Worlds. Man only doth not know The universal Sabbath, doth not join With Nature in her homage. Yet the prayer Flows from the righteous with intenser love, A holier calm succeeds, and sweeter dreams Visit the slumbers of the penitent. 40. Therefore on Maimuna the Elements Shed healing; every breath she drew was balm. For every flower sent then in incense up Its richest odours; and the song of birds Now, like the music of the Seraphim, Enter'd her soul, and now Made silence aweful by their sudden pause. It seem'd as if the quiet Moon Pour'd quietness; its lovely light Was like the smile of reconciling Heaven. 41. Is it the dew of night That on her glowing cheek Shines in the moon-beam? Oh! she weeps..she weeps! And the Good Angel that abandon'd her At her hell-baptism, by her tears drawn down, Resumes his charge. Then Maimuna Recall'd to mind the double oracle; Quick as the lightning flash Its import glanced upon her, and the hope Of pardon and salvation rose, As now she understood The lying prophecy of truth. She pauses not, she ponders not; The driven air before her fann'd the face Of Thalaba, and he awoke and saw The Sorceress of the Silver Locks. 42. One more permitted spell. She takes the magic thread. With the wide eye of wonder, Thalaba Watches her snowy fingers round and round, Unwind the loosening chain. Again he hears the low sweet voice, The low sweet voice so musical, That sure it was not strange, If in those unintelligible tones Was more than human potency, That with such deep and undefined delight Fill'd the surrender'd soul. The work is done, the song hath ceased; He wakes as from a dream of Paradise, And feels his fetters gone, and with the burst Of wondering adoration, praises God. 43. Her charm hath loosed the chain it bound, But massy walls and iron gates Confine Hodeirah's Son. Heard ye not, Genii of the Air, her spell, That o'er her face there flits The sudden flush of fear? Again her louder lips repeat the charm; Her eye is anxious, her cheek pale, Her pulse plays fast and feeble. Nay, Maimuna! thy power hath ceased, And the wind scatters now The voice which ruled it late. 44. “Be comforted, my soul!” she cried, her eye Brightening with sudden joy, “be comforted! We have burst through the bonds which bound us down To utter death; our covenant with Hell Is blotted out! The Lord hath given me strength! Great is the Lord, and merciful! Hear me, ye rebel Spirits! in the name Of Allah and the Prophet, hear the spell!” 45. Groans then were heard, the prison walls were rent, The whirlwind wrapt them round, and forth they flew, Borne in the chariot of the Winds abroad. THE TENTH BOOK. And the Angel that was sent unto me said, Thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the Most High!..Then said I, Yea, my Lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee; whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh. And I said, Tell on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past. Esdras, ii. 4. 1. Ere there was time for wonder or for fear, The way was past, and lo! again Amid surrounding snows, Within the cavern of the Witch they stand. 2. Then came the weakness of her natural age At once on Maimuna; The burthen of her years Fell on her, and she knew That her repentance in the sight of God Had now found favour, and her hour was come. Her death was like the righteous: “Turn my face To Mecca!” in her languid eyes The joy of certain hope Lit a last lustre, and in death A smile was on her cheek. 3. No faithful crowded round her bier, No tongue reported her good deeds, For her no mourners wail'd and wept, No Iman o'er her perfumed corpse For her soul's health intoned the prayer; Nor column raised by the way-side Implored the passing traveller To say a requiem for the dead. Thalaba laid her in the snow, And took his weapons from the hearth, And then once more the youth began His weary way of solitude. 4. The breath of the East is in his face, And it drives the sleet and the snow. The air is keen, the wind is keen, His limbs are aching with the cold, His eyes are aching with the snow, His very heart is cold, His spirit chill'd within him. He looks on If aught of life be near; But all is sky, and the white wilderness, And here and there a solitary pine, Its branches broken by the weight of snow. His pains abate, his senses, dull With suffering, cease to suffer. Languidly, languidly, Thalaba drags along, A heavy weight is on his lids, His limbs move slow for heaviness, And he full fain would sleep. Not yet, not yet, O Thalaba! Thy hour of rest is come! Not yet may the Destroyer sleep The comfortable sleep; His journey is not over yet, His course not yet fulfill'd!.. Run thou thy race, O Thalaba! The prize is at the goal. 5. It was a Cedar-tree Which woke him from that deadly drowsiness; Its broad round-spreading branches, when they felt The snow, rose upward in a point to heaven, And standing in their strength erect, Defied the baffled storm. He knew the lesson Nature gave, And he shook off his heaviness, And hope revived within him. 6. Now sunk the evening sun, A broad and beamless orb, Adown the glowing sky; Through the red light the snow-flakes fell like fire. Louder grows the biting wind, And it drifts the dust of the snow. The snow is clotted in his hair, The breath of Thalaba Is iced upon his lips. He looks around; the darkness, The dizzy floating of the feathery sky Close in his narrow view. 7. At length, through the thick atmosphere, a light Not distant far appears. He, doubting other wiles of sorcery, With mingled joy and fear, yet quicken'd step, Bends thitherward his way. 8. It was a little, lowly dwelling-place, Amid a garden whose delightful air Was mild and fragrant as the evening wind Passing in summer o'er the coffee-groves Of Yemen, and its blessed bowers of balm. A fount of Fire that in the centre play'd Roll'd all around its wonderous rivulets, And fed the garden with the heat of life. Every where magic! the Arabian's heart Yearn'd after human intercourse. A light!..the door unclosed!.. All silent..he goes in. 9. There lay a Damsel, sleeping on a couch: His step awoke her, and she gazed at him With pleased and wondering look, Fearlessly, like a happy child, Too innocent to fear. With words of courtesy The young intruder spake. At the sound of his voice, a joy Kindled her bright black eyes; She rose and took his hand; But at the touch the joy forsook her cheek: “Oh! it is cold!” she cried, “I thought I should have felt it warm, like mine, But thou art like the rest!” 10. Thalaba stood mute awhile, And wondering at her words: “Cold? Lady!” then he said; “I have travell'd long In this cold wilderness, Till life is well-nigh spent!” 11. LAILA. Art thou a Man, then? THALABA. Nay..I did not think Sorrow and toil could so have alter'd me, As to seem otherwise. LAILA. And thou canst be warm Sometimes? life-warm as I am? THALABA. Surely, Lady, As others are, I am, to heat and cold Subject like all. You see a Traveller, Bound upon hard adventure, who requests Only to rest him here to-night,..to-morrow He will pursue his way. LAILA. Oh..not to-morrow! Not like a dream of joy, depart so soon! And whither wouldst thou go? for all around Is everlasting winter, ice and snow, Deserts unpassable of endless frost. THALABA. He who has led me here, will still sustain me Through cold and hunger. 12. “Hunger?” Laila cried: She clapt her lily hands, And whether from above, or from below, It came, sight could not see, So suddenly the floor was spread with food. 13. LAILA. Why dost thou watch with hesitating eyes The banquet? 't is for thee! I bade it come. THALABA. Whence came it? LAILA. Matters it from whence it came? My Father sent it: when I call, he hears. Nay,..thou hast fabled with me! and art like The forms that wait upon my solitude, Human to eye alone;..thy hunger would not Question so idly else. THALABA. I will not eat! It came by magic! fool, to think that aught But fraud and danger could await me here. Let loose my cloak!.. LAILA. Begone then, insolent! Why dost thou stand and gaze upon me thus? Aye! eye the features well that threaten thee With fraud and danger! in the wilderness They shall avenge me,..in the hour of want, Rise on thy view, and make thee feel How innocent I am: And this remember'd cowardice and insult, With a more painful shame will burn thy cheek, Than now heats mine in anger! THALABA. Mark me, Lady! Many and restless are my enemies: My daily paths have been beset with snares Till I have learnt suspicion, bitter sufferings Teaching the needful vice. If I have wrong'd you,.. For yours should be the face of innocence,.. I pray you pardon me! In the name of God And of his Prophet, I partake your food. LAILA. Lo, now! thou wert afraid of sorcery, And yet hast said a charm! THALABA. A charm? LAILA. And wherefore?.. Is it not delicate food?...What mean thy words? I have heard many spells, and many names, That rule the Genii and the Elements, But never these. THALABA. How! never heard the names Of God and of the Prophet? LAILA. Never...nay now! Again that troubled eye?..thou art a strange man, And wonderous fearful...but I must not twice Be charged with fraud! If thou suspectest still, Depart and leave me! THALABA. And you do not know The God that made you? LAILA. Made me, man!..my Father Made me. He made this dwelling, and the grove, And yonder fountain-fire; and every morn He visits me, and takes the snow, and moulds Women and men, like thee; and breathes into them Motion, and life, and sense,..but, to the touch They are chilling cold; and ever when night closes They melt away again, and leave me here Alone and sad. Oh then how I rejoice When it is day, and my dear Father comes And cheers me with kind words and kinder looks! My dear, dear Father!...Were it not for him, I am so weary of this loneliness, That I should wish I also were of snow, That I might melt away, and cease to be. THALABA. And have you always had your dwelling here Amid this solitude of snow? LAILA. I think so. I can remember, with unsteady feet Tottering from room to room, and finding pleasure In flowers, and toys, and sweetmeats, things which long Have lost their power to please; which, when I see them, Raise only now a melancholy wish, I were the little trifler once again Who could be pleased so lightly! THALABA. Then you know not Your Father's art? LAILA. No. I besought him once To give me power like his, that where he went I might go with him: but he shook his head, And said, it was a power too dearly bought, And kiss'd me with the tenderness of tears. THALABA. And wherefore hath he hidden you thus far From all the ways of humankind? LAILA. 'Twas fear, Fatherly fear and love. He read the stars, And saw a danger in my destiny, And therefore placed me here amid the snows, And laid a spell that never human eye, If foot of man by chance should reach the depth Of this wide waste, shall see one trace of grove, Garden or dwelling-place, or yonder fire, That thaws and mitigates the frozen sky. And, more than this, even if the Enemy Should come, I have a Guardian here. THALABA. A Guardian? LAILA. 'Twas well, that when my sight unclosed upon thee, There was no dark suspicion in thy face, Else I had called his succour! Wilt thou see him? But, if a woman can have terrified thee, How wilt thou bear his unrelaxing brow, And lifted lightnings? THALABA. Lead me to him, Lady! 14. She took him by the hand, And through the porch they past. Over the garden and the grove The fountain-streams of fire Pour'd a broad light like noon: A broad unnatural light, Which made the rose's blush of beauty pale, And dimm'd the rich geranium's scarlet blaze. The various verdure of the grove Wore here one undistinguishable grey, Checquer'd with blacker shade. Suddenly Laila stopt, “I do not think thou art the enemy,” She said, “but He will know! If thou hast meditated wrong, Stranger, depart in time... I would not lead thee to thy death.” 15. She turn'd her gentle eyes Toward him then with anxious tenderness. “So let him pierce my breast,” cried Thalaba, “If it hide thought to harm you!” LAILA. 'Tis a figure, Almost I fear to look at!..yet come on. 'Twill ease me of a heaviness that seems To sink my heart; and thou may'st dwell here then In safety;..for thou shalt not go to-morrow, Nor on the after, nor the after day, Nor ever! It was only solitude Which made my misery here,.. And now, that I can see a human face, And hear a human voice... Oh no! thou wilt not leave me! THALABA. Alas, I must not rest! The star that ruled at my nativity, Shone with a strange and blasting influence. O gentle Lady! I should draw upon you A killing curse! LAILA. But I will ask my Father To save you from all danger; and you know not The wonders he can work; and when I ask, It is not in his power to say me nay. Perhaps thou know'st the happiness it is To have a tender Father? THALABA. He was one, Whom, like a loathsome leper, I have tainted With my contagious destiny. One evening He kiss'd me as he wont, and laid his hands Upon my head, and blest me ere I slept. His dying groan awoke me, for the Murderer Had stolen upon our sleep!...For me was meant The midnight blow of death; my Father died; The brother playmates of my infancy, The baby at the breast, they perish'd all,.. All in that dreadful hour!...but I was saved To remember and revenge. 16. She answer'd not; for now, Emerging from the o'er-arch'd avenue, The finger of her upraised hand Mark'd where the Guardian of the garden stood. It was a brazen Image, every limb And swelling vein and muscle true to life: The left knee bending on, The other straight, firm planted, and his hand Lifted on high to hurl The lightning that it grasp'd. 17. When Thalaba approach'd, The enchanted Image knew Hodeirah's son, And hurl'd the lightning at the dreaded foe. But from Mohareb's hand Had Thalaba received Abdaldar's Ring. Blindly the wicked work The righteous will of Heaven. Full in his face the lightning-bolt was driven; The scattered fire recoil'd; Like the flowing of a summer gale he felt Its ineffectual force; His countenance was not changed, Nor a hair of his head was singed. 18. He started, and his glance Turn'd angrily upon the Maid. The sight disarm'd suspicion;..breathless, pale, Against a tree she stood; Her wan lips quivering, and her eyes Upraised, in silent supplicating fear. 19. Anon she started with a scream of joy, Seeing her Father there, And ran and threw her arms around his neck. “Save me!” she cried, “the Enemy is come! Save me! save me! Okba!” 20. “Okba!” repeats the youth; For never since that hour, When in the tent the Spirit told his name, Had Thalaba let slip The memory of his Father's murderer; “Okba!”..and in his hand He graspt an arrow-shaft, And he rush'd on to strike him. 21. “Son of Hodeirah!” the Old Man replied, “My hour is not yet come;” And putting forth his hand Gently he repell'd the Youth. “My hour is not yet come! But thou may'st shed this innocent Maiden's blood; That vengeance God allows thee!” 22. Around her Father's neck Still Laila's hands were clasp'd; Her face was turn'd to Thalaba, A broad light floated o'er its marble paleness, As the wind waved the fountain fire. Her large dilated eye, in horror raised, Watch'd every look and movement of the youth: “Not upon her,” said he, “Not upon her, Hodeirah's blood cries out For vengeance!” and again his lifted arm Threaten'd the Sorcerer: Again withheld, it felt A barrier that no human strength could burst. 23. “Thou dost not aim the blow more eagerly,” Okba replied, “than I would rush to meet it! But that were poor revenge. O Thalaba, thy God Wreaks on the innocent head His vengeance;..I must suffer in my child! Why dost thou pause to strike thy victim? Allah Permits,..commands the deed.” 24. “Liar!” quoth Thalaba. And Laila's wondering eye Look'd up, all anguish, to her father's face. “By Allah and the Prophet,” he replied, “I speak the words of truth. Misery! misery! That I must beg mine enemy to speed The inevitable vengeance now so near! I read it in her horoscope; Her birth-star warn'd me of Hodeirah's race. I laid a spell, and call'd a Spirit up; He answered, one must die, Laila or Thalaba... Accursed Spirit! even in truth Giving a lying hope! Last, I ascended the seventh Heaven, And on the Everlasting Table there, In characters of light, I read her written doom. The years that it has gnawn me! and the load Of sin that it has laid upon my soul! Curse on this hand, that in the only hour The favouring Stars allow'd, Reek'd with other blood than thine. Still dost thou stand and gaze incredulous? Young man, be merciful, and keep her not Longer in agony.” 25. Thalaba's unbelieving frown Scowl'd on the Sorcerer, When in the air the rush of wings was heard, And Azrael stood before them. In equal terror, at the sight, The Enchanter, the Destroyer stood, And Laila, the victim Maid. 26. “Son of Hodeirah!” said the Angel of Death, “The accursed fables not. When from the Eternal Hand I took The yearly Scroll of Fate, Her name was written there;.. Her leaf hath wither'd on the Tree of Life. This is the hour, and from thy hands Commission'd to receive the Maid I come.” 27. “Hear me, O Angel!” Thalaba replied; “To avenge my father's death, To work the will of Heaven, To root from earth the accursed sorcerer race, I have dared danger undismay'd, I have lost all my soul held dear, I am cut off from all the ties of life, Unmurmuring. For whate'er awaits me still, Pursuing to the end the enterprize, Peril or pain, I bear a ready heart. But strike this Maid! this innocent!... Angel, I dare not do it.” 28. “Remember,” answer'd Azrael, “all thou say'st Is written down for judgement! every word In the balance of thy trial must be weigh'd!” 29. “So be it!” said the Youth: “He who can read the secrets of the heart, Will judge with righteousness! This is no doubtful path; The voice of God within me cannot lie... I will not harm the innocent.” 30. He said, and from above, As though it were the Voice of Night, The startling answer came. “Son of Hodeirah, think again! One must depart from hence, Laila, or Thalaba; She dies for thee, or thou for her; It must be life for life! Son of Hodeirah, weigh it well, While yet the choice is thine!” 31. He hesitated not, But, looking upward, spread his hands to Heaven, “Oneiza, in thy bower of Paradise, Receive me, still unstain'd!” 32. “What!” exclaim'd Okba, “darest thou disobey, Abandoning all claim To Allah's longer aid?” 33. The eager exultation of his speech Earthward recall'd the thoughts of Thalaba. “And dost thou triumph, Murderer? dost thou deem Because I perish, that the unsleeping lids Of Justice shall be closed upon thy crime? Poor, miserable man! that thou canst live With such beast-blindness in the present joy, When o'er thy head the sword of God Hangs for the certain stroke!” 34. “Servant of Allah, thou hast disobey'd; God hath abandon'd thee; This hour is mine!” cried Okba, And shook his daughter off, And drew the dagger from his vest, And aim'd the deadly blow. 35. All was accomplish'd. Laila rush'd between To save the saviour Youth. She met the blow, and sunk into his arms, And Azrael, from the hands of Thalaba, Received her parting soul. THE ELEVENTH BOOK. Those, Sir, that traffic in these seas, Fraught not their bark with fears. Sir Robert Howard. 1. O fool, to think thy human hand Could check the chariot-wheels of Destiny! To dream of weakness in the all-knowing Mind, That its decrees should change! To hope that the united Powers Of Earth, and Air, and Hell, Might blot one letter from the Book of Fate, Might break one link of the eternal chain! Thou miserable, wicked, poor old man! Fall now upon the body of thy child, Beat now thy breast, and pluck the bleeding hairs From thy grey beard, and lay Thine ineffectual hand to close her wound, And call on Hell to aid, And call on Heaven to send Its merciful thunderbolt! 2. The young Arabian silently Beheld his frantic grief. The presence of the hated youth To raging anguish stung The wretched Sorcerer. “Aye! look and triumph!” he exclaim'd, “This is the justice of thy God! A righteous God is he, to let His vengeance fall upon the innocent head!.. Curse thee, curse thee, Thalaba!” 3. All feelings of revenge Had left Hodeirah's son. Pitying and silently he heard The victim of his own iniquities; Not with the officious hand Of consolation, fretting the sore wound He could not hope to heal. 4. So as the Servant of the Prophet stood, With sudden motion the night-air Gently fann'd his cheek. 'Twas a Green Bird, whose wings Had waved the quiet air. On the hand of Thalaba The Green Bird perch'd, and turn'd A mild eye up, as if to win The Adventurer's confidence; Then, springing on, flew forward; And now again returns To court him to the way; And now his hand perceives Her rosy feet press firmer, as she leaps Upon the wing again. 5. Obedient to the call, By the pale moonlight Thalaba pursued, O'er trackless snows, his way; Unknowing he what blessed messenger Had come to guide his steps,.. That Laila's spirit went before his path. Brought up in darkness, and the child of sin, Yet, as the meed of spotless innocence, Just Heaven permitted her by one good deed To work her own redemption after death; So, till the Judgement day, She might abide in bliss, Green warbler of the Bowers of Paradise. 6. The morning sun came forth, Wakening no eye to life In this wide solitude; His radiance, with a saffron hue, like heat, Suffused the desert snow. The Green Bird guided Thalaba; Now oaring with slow wing her upward way; Descending now in slant descent On out-spread pinions motionless; Floating now, with rise and fall alternate, As if the billows of the air Heaved her with their sink and swell. And when beneath the noon The icey glitter of the snow Dazzled his aching sight, Then on his arm alighted the Green Bird, And spread before his eyes Her plumage of refreshing hue. 7. Evening came on; the glowing clouds Tinged with a purple ray the mountain ridge That lay before the Traveller. Ah! whither art thou gone, Guide and companion of the youth, whose eye Has lost thee in the depth of Heaven? Why hast thou left alone The weary wanderer in the wilderness? And now the western clouds grow pale, And night descends upon his solitude. 8. The Arabian youth knelt down, And bow'd his forehead to the ground, And made his evening prayer. When he arose, the stars were bright in heaven, The sky was blue, and the cold Moon Shone over the cold snow. A speck in the air! Is it his guide that approaches? For it moves with the motion of life! Lo! she returns, and scatters from her pinions Odours diviner than the gales of morning Waft from Sabea. 9. Hovering before the youth she hung, Till from her rosy feet, that at his touch Uncurl'd their grasp, he took The fruitful bough they bore. He took and tasted: a new life Flow'd through his renovated frame; His limbs, that late were sore and stiff, Felt all the freshness of repose; His dizzy brain was calm'd, The heavy aching of his lids was gone; For Laila, from the Bowers of Paradise, Had borne the healing fruit. 10. So up the mountain steep, With untired foot he past, The Green Bird guiding him, Mid crags, and ice, and rocks, A difficult way, winding the long ascent. How then the heart of Thalaba rejoiced, When, bosom'd in the mountain depths, A shelter'd Valley open'd on his view! It was the Simorg's vale, The dwelling of the Ancient Bird. 11. On a green and mossy bank, Beside a rivulet, The Bird of Ages stood. No sound intruded on his solitude, Only the rivulet was heard, Whose everlasting flow, From the birth-day of the World, had made The same unvaried murmuring. Here dwelt the all-knowing Bird In deep tranquillity, His eye-lids ever closed In full enjoyment of profound repose. 12. Reverently the youth approach'd That old and only Bird; And crost his arms upon his breast, And bow'd his head and spake. “Earliest of existing things, Earliest thou, and wisest thou, Guide me, guide me, on my way! I am bound to seek the Caverns Underneath the roots of Ocean, Where the Sorcerers have their seat; Thou the eldest, thou the wisest, Guide me, guide me, on my way!” 13. The Ancient Simorg on the youth Unclosed his thoughtful eyes, And answer'd to his prayer. “Northward by the stream proceed; In the Fountain of the Rock Wash away thy worldly stains; Kneel thou there, and seek the Lord, And fortify thy soul with prayer. Thus prepared, ascend the Sledge; Be bold, be wary; seek and find! God hath appointed all.” The Ancient Simorg then let fall his lids, Relapsing to repose. 14. Northward, along the rivulet, The adventurer went his way; Tracing its waters upward to their source. Green Bird of Paradise, Thou hast not left the youth!.. With slow associate flight, She companies his way; And now they reach the Fountain of the Rock. 15. There, in the cold clear well, Thalaba wash'd away his earthly stains, And bow'd his face before the Lord, And fortified his soul with prayer. The while, upon the rock, Stood the celestial Bird, And pondering all the perils he must pass, With a mild, melancholy eye, Beheld the youth beloved. 16. And lo! beneath yon lonely pine, the Sledge:.. There stand the harness'd Dogs, Their wide eyes watching for the youth, Their ears erect, and turn'd toward his way. They were lean as lean might be, Their furrow'd ribs rose prominent, And they were black from head to foot, Save a white line on every breast, Curved like the crescent moon. Thalaba takes his seat in the sledge; His arms are folded on his breast, The Bird is on his knees; There is fear in the eyes of the Dogs, There is fear in their pitiful moan; And now they turn their heads, And seeing him seated, away! 17. The youth, with the start of their speed, Falls back to the bar of the sledge; His hair floats straight in the stream of the wind Like the weeds in the running brook. They wind with speed their upward way, An icey path through rocks of ice: His eye is at the summit now, And thus far all is dangerless; And now upon the height The black Dogs pause and pant; They turn their eyes to Thalaba As if to plead for pity; They moan and whine with fear. 18. Once more away! and now The long descent is seen, A long, long, narrow path; Ice-rocks aright, and hills of snow, Aleft the precipice. Be firm, be firm, O Thalaba! One motion now, one bend, And on the crags below Thy shatter'd flesh will harden in the frost. Why howl the Dogs so mournfully? And wherefore does the blood flow fast All purple o'er their sable skin? His arms are folded on his breast, Nor scourge nor goad hath he, No hand appears to strike, No sounding lash is heard; But piteously they moan and whine, And track their way with blood. 19. Behold! on yonder height A giant Fiend aloft Waits to thrust down the tottering avalanche! If Thalaba looks back, he dies; The motion of fear is death. On..on..with swift and steady pace, Adown that dreadful way! The Youth is firm, the Dogs are fleet, The Sledge goes rapidly; The thunder of the avalanche Re-echoes far behind. On..on..with swift and steady pace, Adown that dreadful way! The Dogs are fleet, the way is steep, The Sledge goes rapidly; They reach the plain below. 20. A wide, blank plain, all desolate. Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb! On go the Dogs with rapid course, The Sledge slides after rapidly, And now the sun went down. They stopt and look'd at Thalaba, The Youth perform'd his prayer; They knelt beside him while he pray'd, They turn'd their heads to Mecca, And tears ran down their cheeks. Then down they laid them in the snow, As close as they could lie, They laid them down and slept. And backward in the sledge, The Adventurer laid himself; There peacefully slept Thalaba, And the Green Bird of Paradise Lay nestling in his breast. 21. The Dogs awoke him at the dawn, They knelt and wept again; Then rapidly they journey'd on, And still the plain was desolate, Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb! And ever at the hour of prayer, They stopt, and knelt, and wept; And still that green and graceful Bird Was as a friend to him by day, And, ever when at night he slept, Lay nestling in his breast. 22. In that most utter solitude It cheer'd his heart to hear Her soft and soothing voice. Her voice was soft and sweet, It rose not with the blackbird's thrill, Nor warbled like that dearest bird that holds The solitary man A loiterer in his thoughtful walk at eve; But if it swell'd with no exuberant joy, It had a tone that touch'd a finer string, A music that the soul received and own'd. Her bill was not the beak of blood; There was a human meaning in her eye When fix'd on Thalaba, He wonder'd while he gazed, And with mysterious love Felt his heart drawn in powerful sympathy. 23. Oh joy! the signs of life appear, The first and single Fir That on the limits of the living world Strikes in the ice its roots. Another, and another now; And now the Larch, that flings its arms Down-curving like the falling wave; And now the Aspin's scatter'd leaves Grey-glittering on the moveless twig; The Poplar's varying verdure now, And now the Birch so beautiful Light as a lady's plumes. Oh joy! the signs of life! the Deer Hath left his slot beside the way; The little Ermine now is seen, White wanderer of the snow; And now from yonder pines they hear The clatter of the Grouse's wings; And now the snowy Owl pursues The Traveller's sledge, in hope of food; And hark! the rosy-breasted bird, The Throstle of sweet song! Joy! joy! the winter-wilds are left! Green bushes now, and greener grass, Red thickets here, all berry-bright, And here the lovely flowers! 24. When the last morning of their way was come, After the early prayer, The Green Bird fix'd on Thalaba A sad and supplicating eye, And speech was given her then: “Servant of God, I leave thee now; If rightly I have guided thee, Give me the boon I beg!” 25. “O gentle Bird!” quoth Thalaba, “Guide and companion of my dangerous way, Friend and sole solace of my solitude, How can I pay thee benefits like these? Ask what thou wilt that I can give, O gentle Bird, the poor return Will leave me debtor still!” 26. “Son of Hodeirah!” she replied, “When thou shalt see an Old Man bent beneath The burthen of his earthly punishment, Forgive him, Thalaba! Yea, send a prayer to God in his behalf!” 27. A flush o'erspread the young Destroyer's cheek; He turn'd his eye towards the Bird As if in half repentance; for he thought Of Okba; and his Father's dying groan Came on his memory. The celestial Bird Saw and renew'd her speech; “O Thalaba, if she who in thine arms Received the dagger-blow and died for thee Deserve one kind remembrance,..save, O save The Father that she loves from endless death!” 28. “Laila! and is it thou?” the youth replied, “What is there that I durst refuse to thee? This is no time to harbour in my heart One evil thought;..here I put off revenge, The last rebellious feeling...Be it so! God grant to me the pardon that I need, As I do pardon him!... But who am I, that I should save The sinful soul alive?” 29. “Enough!” said Laila. “When the hour shall come, Remember me! my task is done. We meet again in Paradise!” She said, and shook her wings, and up she soar'd With arrowy swiftness through the heights of Heaven, 30. His aching eye pursued her path, When starting onward went the Dogs; More rapidly they hurried now, In hope of near repose. It was the early morning yet, When, by the well-head of a brook They stopt, their journey done. The spring was clear, the water deep; A venturous man were he, and rash, That should have probed its depths; For all its loosen'd bed below, Heaved strangely up and down, And to and fro, from side to side, It heaved, and waved, and toss'd, And yet the depths were clear, And yet no ripple wrinkled o'er The face of that fair Well. 31. And on that Well, so strange and fair, A little boat there lay, Without an oar, without a sail, One only seat it had, one seat, As if for only Thalaba. And at the helm a Damsel stood, A Damsel bright and bold of eye, Yet did a maiden modesty Adorn her fearless brow; Her face was sorrowful, but sure More beautiful for sorrow. To her the Dogs look'd wistful up, And then their tongues were loosed: “Have we done well, O Mistress dear! And shall our sufferings end?” 32. The gentle Damsel made reply: “Poor servants of the God I serve, When all this witchery is destroy'd, Your woes will end with mine. A hope, alas! how long unknown! This new adventurer gives; Now God forbid, that he, like you, Should perish for his fears! Poor servants of the God I serve, Wait ye the event in peace.” A deep and total slumber as she spake Seized them. Sleep on, poor sufferers! be at rest! Ye wake no more to anguish:..ye have borne The Chosen, the Destroyer!..soon his hand Shall strike the efficient blow; And shaking off your penal forms, shall ye, With songs of joy, amid the Eden groves, Hymn the Deliverer's praise. 33. Then did the Damsel say to Thalaba, “The morn is young, the Sun is fair, And pleasantly through pleasant banks Yon quiet stream flows on.. Wilt thou embark with me? Thou knowest not the water's way; Think, Stranger, well! and night must come,.. Darest thou embark with me? Through fearful perils thou must pass,.. Stranger, the wretched ask thine aid! Thou wilt embark with me!” She smiled in tears upon the youth;.. What heart were his, who could gainsay That melancholy smile? “I will,” quoth Thalaba, “I will, in Allah's name!” 34. He sate him on the single seat, The little boat moved on. Through pleasant banks the quiet stream Went winding pleasantly; By fragrant fir-groves now it past, And now, through alder-shores, Through green and fertile meadows now It silently ran by. The flag-flower blossom'd on its side, The willow tresses waved, The flowing current furrow'd round The water-lily's floating leaf, The fly of green and gauzy wing, Fell sporting down its course; And grateful to the voyager The freshness that it breathed, And soothing to his ear Its murmur round the prow. The little boat falls rapidly Adown the rapid stream. 35. But many a silent spring meantime, And many a rivulet and rill Had swoln the growing stream; And when the southern Sun began To wind the downward way of heaven, It ran a river deep and wide, Through banks that widen'd still. Then once again the Damsel spake: “The stream is strong, the river broad, Wilt thou go on with me? The day is fair, but night must come.. Wilt thou go on with me? Far, far away, the sufferer's eye For thee hath long been looking,.. “Thou wilt go on with me!” “Sail on, sail on,” quoth Thalaba, “Sail on, in Allah's name!” The little boat falls rapidly Adown the river-stream. 36. A broader and yet broader stream, That rock'd the little boat! The Cormorant stands upon its shoals, His black and dripping wings Half open'd to the wind. The Sun goes down, the crescent Moon Is brightening in the firmament; And what is yonder roar, That sinking now, and swelling now, But evermore increasing, Still louder, louder, grows? The little boat falls rapidly Adown the rapid tide; The Moon is bright above, And the great Ocean opens on their way. 37. Then did the Damsel speak again, “Wilt thou go on with me? The Moon is bright, the sea is calm, I know the ocean-paths; Wilt thou go on with me?.. Deliverer! yes! thou dost not fear! Thou wilt go on with me!” “Sail on, sail on!” quoth Thalaba, “Sail on, in Allah's name!” 38. The Moon is bright, the sea is calm, The little boat rides rapidly Across the ocean waves; The line of moonlight on the deep Still follows as they voyage on; The winds are motionless; The gentle waters gently part In dimples round the prow. He looks above, he looks around, The boundless heaven, the boundless sea, The crescent moon, the little boat, Nought else above, below. 39. The Moon is sunk; a dusky grey Spreads o'er the Eastern sky; The stars grow pale and paler;.. Oh beautiful! the godlike Sun Is rising o'er the sea! Without an oar, without a sail, The little boat rides rapidly;.. Is that a cloud that skirts the sea? There is no cloud in heaven! And nearer now, and darker now.. It is..it is..the Land! For yonder are the rocks that rise Dark in the reddening morn; For loud around their hollow base The surges rage and foam. 40. The little boat rides rapidly, And pitches now with shorter toss Upon the narrower swell; And now so near, they see The shelves and shadows of the cliff, And the low-lurking rocks, O'er whose black summits, hidden half, The shivering billows burst;.. And nearer now they feel the breaker's spray. Then said the Damsel: “Yonder is our path Beneath the cavern arch. Now is the ebb, and till the ocean flow We cannot over-ride the rocks. Go thou, and on the shore Perform thy last ablutions, and with prayer Strengthen thy heart..I too have need to pray.” 41. She held the helm with steady hand Amid the stronger waves; Through surge and surf she drove; The adventurer leapt to land. THE TWELFTH BOOK. Why should he that loves me, sorry be For my deliverance, or at all complain My good to hear, and toward joys to see? I go, and long desired have to go, I go with gladness to my wished rest. Spenser's Daphnaida. 1. Then Thalaba drew off Abdaldar's ring, And cast it in the sea, and cried aloud, “Thou art my shield, my trust, my hope, O God! Behold and guard me now, Thou who alone canst save. If from my childhood up I have look'd on With exultation to my destiny; If in the hour of anguish I have own'd The justice of the hand that chasten'd me; If of all selfish passions purified I go to work thy will, and from the world Root up the ill-doing race, Lord! let not thou the weakness of my arm Make vain the enterprize!” 2. The Sun was rising all magnificent, Ocean and Heaven rejoicing in his beams. And now had Thalaba Perform'd his last ablutions, and he stood And gazed upon the little boat Riding the billows near, Where, like a sea-bird breasting the broad waves, It rose and fell upon the surge, Till from the glitterance of the sunny main He turn'd his aching eyes; And then upon the beach he laid him down, And watch'd the rising tide. He did not pray, he was not calm for prayer; His spirit, troubled with tumultuous hope, Toil'd with futurity; His brain, with busier workings, felt The roar and raving of the restless sea, The boundless waves that rose and roll'd and rock'd: The everlasting sound Opprest him, and the heaving infinite: He closed his lids for rest. 3. Meantime with fuller reach and stronger swell, Wave after wave advanced; Each following billow lifted the last foam That trembled on the sand with rainbow hues; The living flower that, rooted to the rock, Late from the thinner element Shrunk down within its purple stem to sleep, Now feels the water, and again Awakening, blossoms out All its green anther-necks. 4. Was there a Spirit in the gale That fluttered o'er his cheek? For it came on him like the new-risen sun Which plays and dallies o'er the night-closed flower, And wooes it to unfold anew to joy; For it came on him as the dews of eve Descend with healing and with life Upon the summer mead; Or liker the first sound of seraph song And Angel greeting, to the soul Whose latest sense had shuddered at the groan Of anguish, kneeling by a death-bed side. 5. He starts, and gazes round to seek The certain presence. “Thalaba!” exclaim'd The Voice of the Unseen;.. “Father of my Oneiza!” he replied, “And have thy years been number'd? art thou too Among the Angels?”...“Thalaba!” A second and a dearer voice repeats, “Go in the favour of the Lord, My Thalaba, go on! My husband, I have drest our bower of bliss. Go, and perform the work; Let me not longer suffer hope in Heaven!” 6. He turn'd an eager glance toward the sea. “Come!” quoth the Damsel, and she drove Her little boat to land. Impatient through the rising wave, He rush'd to meet its way, His eye was bright, his cheek was flush'd with joy. “Hast thou had comfort in thy prayers?” she ask'd. “Yea,” Thalaba replied, “A heavenly visitation.” “God be praised!” She answer'd, “then I do not hope in vain!” And her voice trembled, and her lip Quiver'd, and tears ran down. 7. “Stranger,” said she, “in years long past Was one who vow'd himself The Champion of the Lord, like thee, Against the race of Hell. Young was he, as thyself, Gentle, and yet so brave! A lion-hearted man. Shame on me, Stranger! in the arms of love I held him from his calling, till the hour Was past; and then the Angel who should else Have crown'd him with his glory-wreath, Smote him in anger...Years and years are gone.. And in his place of penance he awaits Thee, the Deliverer,..surely thou art he! It was my righteous punishment, In the same youth unchanged, And love unchangeable, Sorrow for ever fresh, And bitter penitence, That gives no respite night nor day from grief, To abide the written hour, when I should waft The doom'd Destroyer and Deliverer here. Remember thou, that thy success affects No single fate, no ordinary woes.” 8. As thus she spake, the entrance of the cave Darken'd the boat below. Around them, from their nests, The screaming sea-birds fled, Wondering at that strange shape, Yet unalarm'd at sight of living man, Unknowing of his sway and power misused: The clamours of their young Echoed in shriller cries, Which rung in wild discordance round the rock. And farther as they now advanced, The dim reflection of the darken'd day Grew fainter, and the dash Of the out-breakers deaden'd; farther yet, And yet more faint the gleam, And there the waters, at their utmost bound, Silently rippled on the rising rock. They landed and advanced, and deeper in, Two adamantine doors Closed up the cavern pass. 9. Reclining on the rock beside, Sate a grey-headed man, Watching an hour-glass by. To him the Damsel spake, “Is it the hour appointed?” The Old Man Nor answer'd her awhile, Nor lifted he his downward eye, For now the glass ran low, And, like the days of age, With speed perceivable, The latter sands descend; And now the last are gone. Then he look'd up, and raised his hand, and smote The adamantine gates. 10. The gates of adamant Unfolding at the stroke, Open'd and gave the entrance. Then she turn'd To Thalaba and said, “Go, in the name of God! I cannot enter,..I must wait the end In hope and agony. God and Mahommed prosper thee, For thy sake and for ours!” 11. He tarried not,..he past The threshold, over which was no return. All earthly thoughts, all human hopes And passions now put off, He cast no backward glance Toward the gleam of day. There was a light within, A yellow light, as when the autumnal Sun, Through travelling rain and mist Shines on the evening hills: Whether, from central fires effused, Or that the sun-beams, day by day, From earliest generations, there absorb'd, Were gathering for the wrath-flame. Shade was none In those portentous vaults; Crag overhanging, nor columnal rock Cast its dark outline there; For with the hot and heavy atmosphere The light incorporate, permeating all, Spread over all its equal yellowness. There was no motion in the lifeless air; He felt no stirring as he past Adown the long descent; He heard not his own footsteps on the rock That through the thick stagnation sent no sound. How sweet it were, he thought, To feel the flowing wind! With what a thirst of joy He should breathe in the open gales of heaven! 12. Downward, and downward still, and still the way, The lengthening way is safe. Is there no secret wile, No lurking enemy? His watchful eye is on the wall of rock,.. And warily he marks the roof, And warily surveys The path that lies before. Downward, and downward still, and still the way, The long, long way is safe; Rock only, the same light, The same dead atmosphere, And solitude, and silence like the grave. 13. At length the long descent Ends on a precipice; No feeble ray enter'd its dreadful gulph; For in the pit profound, Black Darkness, utter Night, Repell'd the hostile gleam, And o'er the surface the light atmosphere Floated, and mingled not. Above the depth, four over-awning wings, Unplumed and huge and strong, Bore up a little car; Four living pinions, headless, bodiless, Sprung from one stem that branch'd below In four down-arching limbs, And clench'd the car-rings endlong and athwart With claws of griffin grasp. 14. But not on these, the depth so terrible, The wonderous wings, fix'd Thalaba his eye; For there, upon the brink, With fiery fetters fasten'd to the rock, A man, a living man, tormented lay, The young Othatha; in the arms of love He who had linger'd out the auspicious hour, Forgetful of his call. In shuddering pity, Thalaba exclaim'd, “Servant of God, can I not succour thee?” He groan'd, and answered, “Son of Man, I sinn'd, and am tormented; I endure In patience and in hope. The hour that shall destroy the Race of Hell, That hour shall set me free.” 15. “Is it not come?” quoth Thalaba, “Yea! by this omen!”..and with fearless hand He grasp'd the burning fetters, “in the name Of God!”..and from the rock Rooted the rivets, and adown the gulph Dropt them. The rush of flames roar'd up, For they had kindled in their fall The deadly vapours of the pit profound, And Thalaba bent on and look'd below. But vainly he explored The deep abyss of flame, That sunk beyond the plunge of mortal eye, Now all ablaze, as if infernal fires Illumed the world beneath. Soon was the poison-fuel spent, The flame grew pale and dim, And dimmer now it fades, and now is quench'd, And all again is dark, Save where the yellow air Enters a little in and mingles slow. 16. Meantime, the freed Othatha claspt his knees, And cried, “Deliverer!” struggling then With joyful hope, “and where is she,” he cried, ‘Whose promised coming for so many a year...” “Go!” answer'd Thalaba, “She waits thee at the gates.” “And in thy triumph,” he replied, “There thou wilt join us?”..The Deliverer's eye Glanced on the abyss, way else was none.. The depth was unascendable. “Await not me,” he cried, “My path hath been appointed! go..embark! Return to life,..live happy!” OTHATHA. But thy name?.. That through the nations we may blazon it,.. That we may bless thee! THALABA. Bless the Merciful! 17. Then Thalaba pronounced the name of God, And leapt into the car. Down, down, it sunk,..down, down,.. He neither breathes nor sees; His eyes are closed for giddiness, His breath is sinking with the fall. The air that yields beneath the car, Inflates the wings above. Down..down..a measureless depth!..down..down, Was then the Simorg with the Powers of ill Associate to destroy? And was that lovely Mariner A fiend as false as fair? For still the car sinks down; But ever the uprushing wind Inflates the wings above, And still the struggling wings Repel the rushing wind. Down..down..and now it strikes. 18. He stands and totters giddily, All objects round awhile Float dizzy on his sight; Collected soon, he gazes for the way. There was a distant light that led his search; The torch a broader blaze, The unpruned taper flares a longer flame, But this was strong, as is the noontide sun, So, in the glory of its rays intense, It quiver'd with green glow. Beyond was all unseen, No eye could penetrate That unendurable excess of light. 19. It veil'd no friendly form, thought Thalaba: And wisely did he deem, For at the threshold of the rocky door, Hugest and fiercest of his kind accurst, Fit warden of the sorcery-gate, A rebel Afreet lay; He scented the approach of human food, And hungry hope kindled his eye of fire. Raising his hand to screen the dazzled sense, Onward held Thalaba, And lifted still at times a rapid glance; Till the due distance gain'd, With head abased, he laid An arrow in its rest. With steady effort and knit forehead then, Full on the painful light He fix'd his aching eye, and loosed the bow. 20. A hideous yell ensued; And sure no human voice had scope or power For that prodigious shriek Whose pealing echoes thundered up the rock. Dim grew the dying light; But Thalaba leapt onward to the doors Now visible beyond, And while the Afreet warden of the way Was writhing with his death-pangs, over him Sprung and smote the stony doors, And bade them, in the name of God, give way! 21. The dying Fiend beneath him, at that name Tost in worse agony, And the rocks shudder'd, and the rocky doors Rent at the voice asunder. Lo! within.. The Teraph and the Fire, And Khawla, and in mail complete Mohareb for the strife. But Thalaba, with numbing force, Smites his raised arm, and rushes by; For now he sees the fire, amid whose flames, On the white ashes of Hodeirah, lies Hodeirah's holy Sword. 22. He rushes to the Fire: Then Khawla met the youth, And leapt upon him, and with clinging arms Clasps him, and calls Mohareb now to aim The effectual vengeance. O fool! fool! he sees His Father's Sword, and who shall bar his way? Who stand against the fury of that arm That spurns her to the ground?.. She rises half, she twists around his knees,.. A moment..and he vainly strives To shake her from her hold; Impatient then he seized her leathery neck With throttling grasp, and as she loosed her hold, Thrust her aside, and unimpeded now Springs forward to the Sword. 23. The co-existent Flame Knew the Destroyer; it encircled him, Roll'd up his robe, and gather'd round his head: Condensing to intenser splendour there, His Crown of Glory and his Light of Life, Hover'd the irradiate wreath. 24. The instant Thalaba had laid his hand Upon his Father's Sword, The Living Image in the inner cave Smote the Round Altar. The Domdaniel rock'd Through all its thundering vaults; Over the Surface of the reeling Earth, The alarum shock was felt; The Sorcerer brood, all, all, where'er dispersed, Perforce obey'd the summons; all,..they came Compell'd by Hell and Heaven; By Hell compell'd to keep Their baptism-covenant, And with the union of their strength Oppose the common danger; forced by Heaven To share the common doom. 25. Vain are all spells! the Destroyer Treads the Domdaniel floor. They crowd with human arms and human force To crush the single foe. Vain is all human force! He wields his Father's Sword, The vengeance of awaken'd Deity. But chief on Thalaba, Mohareb prest; The Witch in her oracular speech Announced one fatal blow for both, And, desperate of self-safety, yet he hoped To serve the cause of Eblis, and uphold His empire, true in death. 26. Who shall withstand the Destroyer? Scatter'd befre the sword of Thalaba The Sorcerer throng recede, And leave him space for combat. Wretched man,... What shall the helmet or the shield avail Against Almighty anger?..wretched man, Too late Mohareb finds that he hath chosen The evil part!..He rears his shield To meet the Arabian's sword,.. Under the edge of that fire-hardened steel, The shield falls sever'd; his cold arm Rings with the jarring blow:.. He lifts his scymetar; A second stroke, and lo! the broken hilt Hangs from his palsied hand: And now he bleeds, and now he flies, And fain would hide himself amid the troop; But they feel the sword of Hodeirah, But they also fly from the ruin, And hasten to the inner cave, And fall all fearfully Around the Giant Idol's feet, Seeking protection from the Power they served. 27. It was a Living Image, by the art Of magic hands, of flesh and bones composed, And human blood, through veins and arteries That flow'd with vital action. In the shape Of Eblis it was made; Its stature such, and such its strength, As when among the sons of God Pre-eminent he raised his radiant head, Prince of the Morning. On his brow A coronet of meteor flames, Flowing in points of light. Self-poised in air before him Hung the Round Altar, rolling like the World On its diurnal axis, like the World Chequer'd with sea and shore, The work of Demon art. For where the sceptre in the Idol's hand Touch'd the Round Altar, in its answering realm, Earth felt the stroke, and Ocean rose in storms, And shatter'd Cities, shaken from their seat, Crush'd all their habitants. His other arm was raised, and its spread palm Sustain'd the ocean-weight, Whose naked waters arch'd the sanctuary; Sole prop and pillar he. 28. Fallen on the ground, around his feet, The Sorcerers lay. Mohareb's quivering arms Clung to the Idol's knees; The Idol's face was pale, And calm in terror he beheld The approach of the Destroyer. 29. Sure of his stroke, and therefore in pursuit Following, nor blind, nor hasty, on his foe, Moved the Destroyer. Okba met his way, Of all that brotherhood He only fearless, miserable man, The one that had no hope. “On me, on me,” the childless Sorcerer cried, Let fall the weapon! I am he who stole Upon the midnight of thy Father's tent; This is the hand that pierced Hodeirah's heart, That felt thy brethren's and thy sisters' blood Gush round the dagger-hilt. Let fall on me The fated sword! the vengeance-hour is come! Destroyer, do thy work!” 30. Nor wile, nor weapon, had the desperate wretch; He spread his bosom to the stroke. “Old Man, I strike thee not!” said Thalaba; “The evil thou hast done to me and mine Brought its own bitter punishment. For thy dear Daughter's sake I pardon thee, As I do hope Heaven's pardon...For her sake Repent while time is yet!..thou hast my prayers To aid thee; thou poor sinner, cast thyself Upon the goodness of offended God! I speak in Laila's name; and what if now Thou canst not think to join in Paradise Her spotless Spirit,..hath not Allah made Al-Araf, in his wisdom? where the sight Of Heaven may kindle in the penitent The strong and purifying fire of hope, Till, at the Day of Judgement, he shall see The Mercy-Gates unfold.” 31. The astonish'd man stood gazing as he spake, At length his heart was soften'd, and the tears Gush'd, and he sobb'd aloud. Then suddenly was heard The all-beholding Prophet's voice divine, “Thou hast done well, my Servant! Ask and receive thy reward!” 32. A deep and aweful joy Seem'd to dilate the heart of Thalaba; With arms in reverence cross'd upon his breast, Upseeking eyes suffused with tears devout, He answered to the Voice, “Prophet of God, Holy, and good, and bountiful! One only earthly wish have I, to work Thy will; and thy protection grants me that. Look on this Sorcerer! heavy are his crimes, But infinite is mercy! if thy servant Have now found favour in the sight of God, Let him be touch'd with penitence, and save His soul from utter death.” 33. “The groans of penitence,” replied the Voice, “Never arise unheard! But, for thyself, prefer the prayer; The Treasure-house of Heaven Is open to thy will.” 34. “Prophet of God!” then answered Thalaba, “I am alone on earth; Thou knowest the secret wishes of my heart! Do with me as thou wilt! thy will is best.” 35. There issued forth no Voice to answer him; But, lo! Hodeirah's Spirit comes to see His vengeance, and beside him, a pure form Of roseate light, his Angel mother hung. “My Child, my dear, my glorious..blessed..Child, My promise is perform'd..fulfil thy work!” 36. Thalaba knew that his death-hour was come; And on he leapt, and springing up, Into the Idol's heart Hilt-deep he plunged the Sword. The Ocean-vault fell in, and all were crush'd. In the same moment, at the gate Of Paradise, Oneiza's Houri form Welcomed her Husband to eternal bliss. END OF THE FOURTH VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. V. TO CHARLES WATKIN WILLIAMS WYNN, THIS POEM WAS ORIGINALLY INSCRIBED, IN 1805, AS A TOKEN OF SIXTEEN YEARS OF UNINTERRUPTED FRIENDSHIP; AND IS NOW RE-INSCRIBED WITH THE SAME FEELING, AFTER AN INTERVAL OF THIRTY-TWO. MADOC. MADOC IN WALES. PART THE FIRST. I. THE RETURN TO WALES. Fair blows the wind, . . the vessel drives along, Her streamers fluttering at their length, her sails All full, . . she drives along, and round her prow Scatters the ocean spray. What feelings then Fill'd every bosom, when the mariners, After the peril of that weary way, Beheld their own dear country! Here stands one Stretching his sight toward the distant shore, And as to well-known forms his busy joy Shapes the dim outline, eagerly he points The fancied headland and the cape and bay, Till his eyes ache o'erstraining. This man shakes His comrade's hand and bids him welcome home, And blesses God, and then he weeps aloud: Here stands another, who in secret prayer Calls on the Virgin and his patron Saint, Renewing his old vows of gifts and alms And pilgrimage, so he may find all well. Silent and thoughtful and apart from all Stood Madoc; now his noble enterprize Proudly remembering, now in dreams of hope, Anon of bodings full and doubt and fear. Fair smiled the evening, and the favouring gale Sung in the shrouds, and swift the steady bark Rush'd roaring through the waves. The sun goes down: Far off his light is on the naked crags Of Penmanmawr, and Arvon's ancient hills; And the last glory lingers yet awhile, Crowning old Snowdon's venerable head, That rose amid his mountains. Now the ship Drew nigh where Mona, the dark island, stretch'd Her shore along the ocean's lighter line. There through the mist and twilight, many a fire Up-flaming stream'd upon the level sea Red lines of lengthening light, which, far away Rising and falling, flash'd athwart the waves. Thereat full many a thought of ill disturb'd Prince Madoc's mind; . . did some new conqueror seize The throne of David? had the tyrant's guilt Awaken'd vengeance to the deed of death? Or blazed they for a brother's obsequies, The sport and mirth of murder? . . Like the lights Which there upon Aberfraw's royal walls Are waving with the wind, the painful doubt Fluctuates within him... Onward drives the gale, . . On flies the bark; . . and she hath reach'd at length Her haven, safe from her unequall'd way! And now, in louder and yet louder joy Clamorous, the happy mariners all-hail Their native shore, and now they leap to land. There stood an old man on the beach to wait The comers from the ocean; and he ask'd, Is it the Prince? And Madoc knew his voice, And turn'd to him and fell upon his neck; For it was Urien who had foster'd him, Had loved him like a child; and Madoc loved, Even as a father loved he that old man. My Sister? quoth the Prince... Oh, she and I Have wept together, Madoc, for thy loss, . . That long and cruel absence! . . She and I, Hour after hour and day by day, have look'd Toward the waters, and with aching eyes And aching heart, sate watching every sail. And David and our brethren? cried the Prince, As they moved on... But then old Urien's lips Were slow at answer; and he spake, and paused In the first breath of utterance, as to choose Fit words for uttering some unhappy tale. More blood, quoth Madoc, yet? Hath David's fear Forced him to still more cruelty? Alas.. Woe for the house of Owen! Evil stars, Replied the old man, ruled o'er thy brethren's birth, From Dolwyddelan driven, his peaceful home, Poor Yorwerth sought the church's sanctuary; The murderer follow'd; . . Madoc, need I say Who sent the sword? . . Llewelyn, his brave boy, Where wanders he? in this his rightful realm, Houseless and hunted; richly would the king Gift the red hand that rid him of that fear! Ririd, an outlaw'd fugitive, as yet Eludes his deadly purpose; Rodri lives, A prisoner he, . . I know not in what fit Of natural mercy from the slaughter spared. Oh, if my dear old master saw the wreck And scattering of his house! . . that princely race! The beautiful band of brethren that they were! Madoc made no reply, . . he closed his eyes, Groaning. But Urien, for his heart was full, Loving to linger on the woe, pursued: I did not think to live to such an hour Of joy as this! and often, when my sight Turn'd dizzy from the ocean, overcome With heavy anguish, Madoc, I have prayed That God would please to take me to his rest. So as he ceased his speech, a sudden shout Of popular joy awakened Madoc's ear: And calling then to mind the festal fires, He ask'd their import. The old man replied, It is the giddy people merry-making To welcome their new Queen; unheeding they The shame and the reproach to the long line Of our old royalty! . . . Thy brother weds The Saxon's sister. What! . . in loud reply Madoc exclaim'd, hath he forgotten all? David! King Owen's son, . . my father's son, . . He wed the Saxon, . . the Plantagenet! Quoth Urien, He so doats, as she had dropt Some philtre in his cup, to lethargize The British blood that came from Owen's veins. Three days his halls have echoed to the song Of joyaunce. Shame! foul shame! that they should hear Songs of such joyaunce! cried the indignant Prince: Oh that my Father's hall, where I have heard The songs of Corwen and of Keiriog's day, Should echo this pollution! Will the chiefs Brook this alliance, this unnatural tie? There is no face but wears a courtly smile, Urien replied: Aberfraw's ancient towers Beheld no pride of festival like this, No like solemnities, when Owen came In conquest, and Gowalchmai struck the harp. Only Goervyl, careless of the pomp, Sits in her solitude, lamenting thee. Saw ye not then my banner? quoth the Lord Of Ocean; on the topmast-head it stood To tell the tale of triumph; . . or did night Hide the glad signal, and the joy hath yet To reach her? Now had they almost attain'd The palace portal. Urien stopt and said, The child should know your coming; it is long Since she hath heard a voice that to her heart Spake gladness; . . none but I must tell her this. So Urien sought Goervyl, whom he found Alone and gazing on the moonlight sea. Oh you are welcome, Urien! cried the maid. There was a ship came sailing hitherward... I could not see his banner, for the night Closed in so fast around her; but my heart Indulged a foolish hope! The old man replied, With difficult effort keeping his heart down, God in his goodness may reserve for us That blessing yet! I have yet life enow To trust that I shall live to see the day, Albeit the number of my years well nigh Be full. Ill-judging kindness! said the maid. Have I not nursed for two long wretched years That miserable hope, which every day Grew weaker, like a baby sick to death, Yet dearer for its weakness day by day! No, never shall we see his daring bark! I knew and felt it in the evil hour When forth she fared! I felt it then! that kiss Was our death-parting! . . . And she paused to curb The agony: anon, . . But thou hast been To learn their tidings, Urien? . . He replied, In half-articulate words, . . They said, my child, That Madoc lived, . . that soon he would be here. She had received the shock of happiness: Urien! she cried... thou art not mocking me! Nothing the old man spake, but spread his arms Sobbing aloud. Goervyl from their hold Started, and sunk upon her brother's breast. Recovering first, the aged Urien said, Enough of this, . . . there will be time for this, My children! better it behoves ye now To seek the King. And, Madoc, I beseech thee, Bear with thy brother! gently bear with him, My gentle Prince! he is the headstrong slave Of passions unsubdued; he feels no tie Of kindly love, or blood; . . provoke him not, Madoc! . . . It is his nature's malady. Thou good old man! replied the Prince, be sure I shall remember what to him is due, What to myself; for I was in my youth Wisely and well train'd up; nor yet hath time Effaced the lore my foster-father taught. Haste, haste! exclaim'd Goervyl; . . for her heart Smote her in sudden terror at the thought Of Yorwerth, and of Owen's broken house; . . I dread his dark suspicions! Not for me Suffer that fear, my sister! quoth the Prince. Safe is the straight and open way I tread; Nor hath God made the human heart so bad That thou or I should have a danger there. So saying, they toward the palace gate Went on, ere yet Aberfraw had received The tidings of her wanderer's glad return. II. THE MARRIAGE FEAST. The guests were seated at the festal board; Green rushes strewed the floor; high in the hall Was David; Emma, in her bridal robe, In youth, in beauty, by her husband's side Sate at the marriage feast. The monarch raised His eyes, he saw the mariner approach; Madoc! he cried; strong nature's impulses Prevail'd, and with a holy joy he met His brother's warm embrace. With that what peals Of exultation shook Aberfraw's tower! How then re-echoing rang the home of Kings, When from subduëd Ocean, from the World That he had first foreseen, he first had found, Came her triumphant child! The mariners, A happy band, enter the clamorous hall; Friend greets with friend, and all are friends; one joy Fills with one common feeling every heart, And strangers give and take the welcoming Of hand and voice and eye. That boisterous joy At length allay'd, the board was spread anew, Anew the horn was brimm'd, the central hearth Built up anew for later revelries. Now to the ready feast! the seneschal Duly below the pillars ranged the crew; Toward the guest's most honourable seat The King himself led his brave brother; . . then, Eyeing the lovely Saxon as he spake, Here, Madoc, see thy sister! thou hast been Long absent, and our house hath felt the while Sad diminution; but my arm at last Hath rooted out rebellion from the land; And I have stablish'd now our ancient house, Grafting a scyon from the royal tree Of England on the sceptre; so shall peace Bless our dear country. Long and happy years Await my sovereigns! thus the Prince replied, And long may our dear country rest in peace! Enough of sorrow hath our royal house Known in the field of battles, . . yet we reap'd The harvest of renown. Aye, . . many a day, David replied, together have we led The onset... Dost thou not remember, brother, How in that hot and unexpected charge On Keiriog's bank, we gave the enemy Their welcoming? And Berwyn's after-strife! Quoth Madoc, as the memory kindled him: The fool that day, who in his masque attire Sported before King Henry, wished in vain Fitlier habiliments of javelin-proof! And yet not more precipitate that fool Dropt his mock weapons, than the archers cast Desperate their bows and quivers-full away, When we leapt on, and in the mire and blood Trampled their banner! That, exclaimed the king, That was a day indeed, which I may still Proudly remember, proved as I have been In conflicts of such perilous assay, That Saxon combat seem'd like woman's war. When with the traitor Hoel I did wage The deadly battle, then was I in truth Put to the proof; no vantage-ground was there, Nor famine, nor disease, nor storms to aid, But equal, hard, close battle, man to man, Briton to Briton. By my soul, pursued The tyrant, heedless how from Madoc's eye Flash'd the quick wrath like lightning, . . though I knew The rebel's worth, his prowess then excited Unwelcome wonder; even at the last, When stiff with toil and faint with wounds, he raised Feebly his broken sword, . . . Then Madoc's grief Found utterance; Wherefore, David, dost thou rouse The memory now of that unhappy day, That thou should'st wish to hide from earth and heaven? Not in Aberfraw, . . not to me this tale! Tell it the Saxon! . . he will join thy triumph, . . He hates the race of Owen! . . but I loved My brother Hoel, . . loved him? . . that ye knew! I was to him the dearest of his kin, And he my own heart's brother. David's cheek Grew pale and dark; he bent his broad black brow Full upon Madoc's glowing countenance; Art thou return'd to brave me? to my teeth To praise the rebel bastard? to insult The royal Saxon, my affianced friend? I hate the Saxon! Madoc cried; not yet Have I forgotten, how from Keiriog's shame Flying, the coward wreak'd his cruelty On our poor brethren! . . . David, seest thou never Those eyeless spectres by thy bridal bed? Forget that horror? . . may the fire of God Blast my right hand, or ever it be link'd With that accursed Plantagenet's! The while, Impatience struggled in the heaving breast Of David; every agitated limb Shook with ungovernable wrath; the page, Who chafed his feet, in fear suspends his task; In fear the guests gaze on him silently; His eyeballs flash'd, strong anger choked his voice, He started up... Him Emma, by the hand Gently retaining, held, with gentle words Calming his rage. Goervyl too in tears Besought her generous brother: he had met Emma's reproaching glance, and self-reproved While the warm blood flush'd deeper o'er his cheek, Thus he replied; I pray you pardon me, My Sister-Queen! nay, you will learn to love This high affection for the race of Owen, Yourself the daughter of his royal house By better ties than blood. Grateful the Queen Replied, by winning smile and eloquent eye Thanking the gentle Prince: a moment's pause Ensued; Goervyl then with timely speech Thus to the wanderer of the waters spake: Madoc, thou hast not told us of the world Beyond the ocean and the paths of man. A lovely land it needs must be, my brother, Or sure you had not sojourn'd there so long, Of me forgetful, and my heavy hours Of grief and solitude and wretched hope. Where is Cadwallon? for one bark alone I saw come sailing here. The tale you ask Is long, Goervyl, said the mariner, And I in truth am weary. Many moons Have wax'd and waned, since from that distant world, The country of my dreams and hope and faith, We spread the homeward sail: a goodly world, My Sister! thou wilt see its goodliness, And greet Cadwallon there.... But this shall be To-morrow's tale; . . indulge we now the feast! . . You know not with what joy we mariners Behold a sight like this. Smiling he spake, And turning, from the sewer's hand he took The flowing mead. David, the while, relieved From rising jealousies, with better eye Regards his venturous brother. Let the Bard, Exclaim'd the king, give his accustom'd lay; For sweet, I know, to Madoc is the song He loved in earlier years. Then, strong of voice, The officer proclaim'd the sovereign will, Bidding the hall be silent; loud he spake, And smote the sounding pillar with his wand, And hush'd the banqueters. The chief of Bards Then raised the ancient lay. Thee, Lord! he sung, O Father! Thee, whose wisdom, Thee, whose power, Whose love, . . all love, all power, all wisdom, Thou! Tongue cannot utter, nor can heart conceive. He in the lowest depth of Being framed The imperishable mind; in every change, Through the great circle of progressive life, He guides and guards, till evil shall be known, And being known as evil, cease to be; And the pure soul, emancipate by Death, The Enlarger, shall attain its end predoom'd, The eternal newness of eternal joy. He left this lofty theme; he struck the harp To Owen's praise, swift in the course of wrath, Father of Heroes. That proud day he sung, When from green Erin came the insulting host, Lochlin's long burthens of the flood, and they Who left their distant homes in evil hour, The death-doom'd Normen. There was heaviest toil, There deeper tumult, where the dragon race Of Mona trampled down the humbled head Of haughty power; the sword of slaughter carved Food for the yellow-footed fowl of heaven, And Menai's waters, burst with plunge on plunge, Curling above their banks with tempest-swell Their bloody billows heaved. The long-past days Came on the mind of Madoc, as he heard That song of triumph; on his sun-burnt brow Sate exultation: . . other thoughts arose, As on the fate of all his gallant house Mournful he mused; oppressive memory swell'd His bosom, over his fix'd eye-balls swam The tear's dim lustre, and the loud-toned harp Rung on his ear in vain; . . its silence first Roused him from dreams of days that were no more. III. CADWALLON. Then on the morrow, at the festal board, The Lord of Ocean thus began his tale. My heart beat high when with the favouring wind We sail'd away; Aberfraw! when thy towers, And the huge head landof my mother isle, Shrunk and were gone. But, Madoc, I would learn, Quoth David, how this enterprize arose, And the wild hope of worlds beyond the sea; For at thine outset being in the war, I did not hear from vague and common fame The moving cause. Sprung it from bardic lore, The hidden wisdom of the years of old, Forgotten long? or did it visit thee In dreams that come from Heaven? The Prince replied, Thou shalt hear all; . . but if, amid the tale, Strictly sincere, I haply should rehearse Aught to the King ungrateful, let my brother Be patient with the involuntary fault. I was the guest of Rhys at Dinevawr, And there the tidings found me, that our sire Was gather'd to his fathers: . . not alone The sorrow came; the same ill messenger Told of the strife that shook our royal house, When Hoel, proud of prowess, seized the throne Which you, for elder claim and lawful birth, Challenged in arms. With all a brother's love, I on the instant hurried to prevent The impious battle: . . all the day I sped; Night did not stay me on my eager way... Where'er I pass'd, new rumour raised new fear... Midnight, and morn, and noon, I hurried on, And the late eve was darkening when I reach'd Arvon, the fatal field... The sight, the sounds, Live in my memory now, . . for all was done! For horse and horseman side by side in death, Lay on the bloody plain; . . a host of men, And not one living soul, . . and not one sound, One human sound; . . only the raven's wing, Which rose before my coming, and the neigh Of wounded horses, wandering o'er the plain. Night now was coming on; a man approach'd And bade me to his dwelling nigh at hand. Thither I turn'd, too weak to travel more; For I was overspent with weariness, And having now no hope to bear me up, Trouble and bodily labour master'd me, I ask'd him of the battle: . . who had fallen He knew not, nor to whom the lot of war Had given my father's sceptre. Here, said he, I came to seek if haply I might find Some wounded wretch, abandon'd else to death. My search was vain, the sword of civil war Had bit too deeply. Soon we reach'd his home, A lone and lowly dwelling in the hills, By a grey mountain stream. Beside the hearth There sate an old blind man; his head was raised As he were listening to the coming sounds, And in the fire-light shone his silver locks. Father, said he who guided me, I bring A guest to our poor hospitality; And then he brought me water from the brook, And homely fare, and I was satisfied: That done, he piled the hearth, and spread around The rushes of repose. I laid me down; But worn with toil, and full of many fears, Sleep did not visit me: the quiet sounds Of nature troubled my distemper'd sense; My ear was busy with the stirring gale, The moving leaves, the brook's perpetual flow. So on the morrow languidly I rose, And faint with fever: but a restless wish Was working in me, and I said, My host, Wilt thou go with me to the battle-field, That I may search the slain? for in the fray My brethren fought; and though with all my speed I strove to reach them ere the strife began, Alas, I sped too slow! Grievest thou for that? He answer'd, grievest thou that thou art spared The shame and guilt of that unhappy strife, Briton with Briton in unnatural war? Nay, I replied, mistake me not! I came To reconcile the chiefs; they might have heard Their brother's voice. Their brother's voice? said he, Was it not so? . . . And thou, too, art the son Of Owen! . . . Yesternight I did not know The cause there is to pity thee. Alas, Two brethren thou wilt lose when one shall fall! . . Lament not him whom death may save from guilt; For all too surely in the conqueror Thou wilt find one whom his own fears henceforth Must make to all his kin a perilous foe. I felt as though he wrong'd my father's sons, And raised an angry eye, and answer'd him, . . . My brethren love me. Then the old man cried, Oh what is Princes' love? what are the ties Of blood, the affections growing as we grow, If but ambition come? . . . Thou deemest sure Thy brethren love thee; . . ye have play'd together In childhood, shared your riper hopes and fears, Fought side by side in battle: . . . they may be Brave, generous, all that once their father was, Whom ye, I ween, call virtuous. At the name, With pious warmth I cried, Yes, he was good, And great, and glorious! Gwyneth's ancient annals Boast not a name more noble. In the war Fearless he was, . . the Saxon found him so; Wise was his counsel, and no supplicant For justice ever from his palace-gate Unrighted turned away. King Owen's name Shall live to after times without a blot! There were two brethren once of kingly line, The old man replied; they loved each other well, And when the one was at his dying hour, It then was comfort to him that he left So dear a brother, who would duly pay A father's duties to his orphan boy. And sure he loved the orphan, and the boy With all a child's sincerity loved him, And learnt to call him father: so the years Went on, till when the orphan gain'd the age Of manhood, to the throne his uncle came. The young man claim'd a fair inheritance, His father's lands; and... mark what follows, Prince! At midnight he was seized, and to his eyes The brazen plate was held... He cried aloud, He look'd around for help, . . . he only saw His Uncle's ministers, prepared to do Their wicked work, who to the red hot brass Forced his poor eyes, and held the open lids. Till the long agony consumed the sense; And when their hold relax'd, it had been worth The wealth of worlds if he could then have seen, Dreadful to him and hideous as they were, Their ruffian faces! . . I am blind, young Prince, And I can tell how sweet a thing it is To see the blessed light! Must more be told? What farther agonies he yet endured? Or hast thou known the consummated crime, And heard Cynetha's fate? A painful glow Inflamed my cheek, and for my father's crime I felt the shame of guilt. The dark-brow'd man Beheld the burning flush, the uneasy eye, That knew not where to rest. Come! we will search The slain; arising from his seat, he said. I follow'd; to the field of fight we went, And over steeds and arms and men we held Our way in silence. Here it was, quoth he, The fiercest war was waged; lo! in what heaps Man upon man fell slaughter'd! Then my heart Smote me, and my knees shook; for I beheld Where, on his conquer'd foemen, Hoel lay. He paused, his heart was full, and on his tongue The imperfect utterance died; a general gloom Sadden'd the hall, and David's cheek grew pale. Commanding first his feelings, Madoc broke The oppressive silence. Then Cadwallon took My hand, and, pointing to his dwelling, cried, Prince, go and rest thee there, for thou hast need Of rest; . . the care of sepulture be mine. Nor did I then comply, refusing rest, Till I had seen in holy ground inearth'd My poor lost brother. Wherefore, he exclaim'd, (And I was awed by his severer eye) Wouldst thou be pampering thy distempered mind? Affliction is not sent in vain, young man, From that good God, who chastens whom he loves. Oh! there is healing in the bitter cup! Go yonder, and before the unerring will Bow, and have comfort! To the hut I went, And there beside the lonely mountain-stream, I veil'd my head, and brooded on the past. He tarried long; I felt the hours pass by, As in a dream of morning, when the mind, Half to reality awaken'd, blends. With airy visions and vague phantasies Her dim perception; till at length his step Aroused me, and he came. I question'd him Where is the body? hast thou bade the priests Perform due masses for his soul's repose? He answer'd me, The rain and dew of heaven Will fall upon the turf that covers him, And greener grass will flourish on his grave. But rouse thee, Prince! there will be hours enough For mournful memory; . . it befits thee now Take counsel for thyself: . . the son of Owen Lives not in safety here. I bow'd my head Opprest by heavy thoughts: all wretchedness The present; darkness on the future lay; Fearful and gloomy both. I answer'd not. Hath power seduced thy wishes? he pursued, And wouldst thou seize upon thy father's throne? Now God forbid! quoth I. Now God forbid! Quoth he; . . but thou art dangerous, Prince! and what Shall shield thee from the jealous arm of power? Think of Cynetha! . . the unsleeping eye Of justice hath not closed upon his wrongs; At length the avenging arm is gone abroad, One woe is past, . . woe after woe comes on, . . There is no safety here, . . here thou must be The victim or the murderer! Does thy heart Shrink from the alternative? . . look round! . . behold What shelter, . . whither wouldst thou fly for peace? What if the asylum of the Church were safe, . . Were there no better purposes ordain'd For that young arm, that heart of noble hopes? Son of our kings, . . of old Cassibelan, Great Caratach, immortal Arthur's line, Oh, shall the blood of that heroic race Stagnate in cloister-sloth? . . Or wouldst thou leave Thy native isle, and beg in awkward phrase Some foreign sovereign's charitable grace, . . The Saxon or the Frank, . . and earn his gold, The hireling in a war whose cause thou know'st not, Whose end concerns not thee? I sate and gazed, Following his eye with wonder, as he paced Before me to and fro, and listening still, Though now he paced in silence. But anon, The old man's voice and step, awakened us, Each from his thought; I will come out, said he, That I may sit beside the brook, and feel The comfortable sun. As forth he came, I could not choose but look upon his face: Gently on him had gentle nature laid The weight of years; all passions that disturb Were past away; the stronger lines of grief Softened and settled, till they told of grief By patient hope and piety subdued: His eyes, which had their hue and brightness left, Fix'd lifelessly, or objectless they roll'd, Nor moved by sense, nor animate with thought. On a smooth stone beside the stream he took His wonted seat in the sunshine. Thou hast lost A brother, Prince, he said.. or the dull ear Of age deceived me. Peace be with his soul! And may the curse that lies upon the house Of Owen turn away! Wilt thou come hither, And let me feel thy face? . . I wondered at him: Yet while his hand perused my lineaments Deep awe and reverence fill'd me. O my God, Bless this young man! he cried; a perilous state Is his; . . but let not thou his father's sins Be visited on him! I raised my eyes Enquiring, to Cadwallon; Nay, young Prince, Despise not thou the blind man's prayer! he cried; It might have given thy father's dying hour A hope, that sure he needed... for, know thou, It is the victim of thy father's crime, Who asks a blessing on thee! At his feet I fell, and clasp'd his knees: he raised me up; . . Blind as I was, a mutilated wretch, A thing that nature owns not, I survived, Loathing existence, and with impious voice Accused the will of heaven, and groan'd for death. Years pass'd away; this universal blank Became familiar, and my soul reposed On God, and I had comfort in my prayers. But there were blessings for me yet in store Thy father knew not, when his bloody fear All hope of an avenger had cut off, How there existed then an unborn babe, Child of my lawless love. Year after year I lived a lonely and forgotten wretch, Before Cadwallon knew his father's fate, Long years and years before I knew my son; For never, till his mother's dying hour, Learnt he his dangerous birth. He sought me then; He woke my soul once more to human ties; . . I hope he hath not wean'd my heart from heaven, Life is so precious now! . . . Dear good old man! And lives he still? Goervyl ask'd, in tears; Madoc replied, I scarce can hope to find A father's welcome at my distant home. I left him full of days, and ripe for death; And the last prayer Cynetha breathed upon me Went like a death-bed blessing to my heart! When evening came, toward the echoing shore I and Cadwallon walk'd together forth: Bright with dilated glory shone the west; But brighter lay the ocean-flood below, The burnish'd silver sea, that heaved and flash'd Its restless rays, intolerably bright. Prince, quoth Cadwallon, thou hast rode the waves In triumph, when the invaders felt thine arm. Oh what a nobler conquest might be won, There, . . . upon that wide field! . . What meanest thou. I cried.... That yonder waters are not spread A boundless waste, a bourne impassable! . . That man should rule the Elements! . . that there Might manly courage, manly wisdom find Some happy isle, some undiscovered shore, Some resting place for peace... Oh that my soul Could seize the wings of Morning! soon would I Behold that other world, where yonder sun Speeds now, to dawn in glory! As he spake Conviction came upon my startled mind, Like lightning on the midnight traveller. I caught his hand; . . Kinsman and guide and friend Yea, let us go together! . . . Down we sate, Full of the vision on the echoing shore; One only object fill'd ear, eye, and thought: We gazed upon the aweful world of waves, And talk'd and dreamt of years that were to come. IV. THE VOYAGE. Not with a heart unmoved I left thy shores, Dear native isle! oh... not without a pang, As thy fair uplands lessened on the view, Cast back the long involuntary look! The morning cheer'd our outset; gentle airs Curl'd the blue deep, and bright the summer sun Play'd o'er the summer ocean, when our barks Began their way. And they were gallant barks, As ever through the raging billows rode; And many a tempest's buffeting they bore. Their sails all swelling with the eastern breeze, Their tighten'd cordage clattering to the mast, Steady they rode the main; the gale aloft Sung in the shrouds, the sparkling waters hiss'd Before, and froth'd, and whiten'd far behind. Day after day, with one auspicious wind, Right to the setting sun we held our course. My hope had kindled every heart; they blest The unvarying breeze, whose unabating strength Still sped us onward; and they said that Heaven Favour'd the bold emprize. How many a time, Mounting the mast-tower-top, with eager ken They gazed, and fancied in the distant sky Their promised shore, beneath the evening cloud, Or seen, low lying, through the haze of morn. I too with eyes as anxious watch'd the waves, Though patient, and prepared for long delay; For not on wild adventure had I rush'd With giddy speed, in some delirious fit Of fancy; but in many a tranquil hour Weigh'd well the attempt, till hope matured to faith. Day after day, day after day the same, . . A weary waste of waters! still the breeze Hung heavy in our sails, and we held on One even course: a second week was gone, And now another past, and still the same, Waves beyond waves, the interminable sea! What marvel, if at length the mariners Grew sick with long expectance? I beheld Dark looks of growing restlessness, I heard Distrust's low murmurings; nor avail'd it long To see and not perceive. Shame had awhile Represt their fear, till like a smother'd fire It burst, and spread with quick contagion round, And strengthen'd as it spread. They spake in tones Which might not be mistaken; . . They had done What men dared do, ventured where never keel Had cut the deep before; still all was sea, The same unbounded ocean! . . to proceed Were tempting heaven. I heard with feign'd surprise, And, pointing then to where our fellow bark, Gay with her fluttering streamers and full sails, Rode, as in triumph, o'er the element, I ask'd them what their comrades there would deem Of those so bold ashore, who, when a day, Perchance an hour might crown their glorious toil, Shrunk then, and coward-like return'd to meet Mockery and shame? True, they had ventured on In seas unknown, beyond where ever man Had plough'd the billows yet: more reason so Why they should now, like him whose happy speed Well nigh hath run the race, with higher hope Press onward to the prize. But late they said, Marking the favour of the steady gale, That heaven was with us; Heaven vouchsafed us still Fair seas and favouring skies; nor need we pray For other aid, the rest was in ourselves; Nature had given it, when she gave to man Courage and constancy. They answer'd not, A while obedient; but I saw with dread The silent sullenness of cold assent. Then, with what fearful eagerness I gazed At earliest daybreak, o'er the distant deep! How sick at heart with hope, when evening closed, Gazed through the gathering shadows! . . . but I saw The sun still sink below the endless waves, And still at morn, beneath the farthest sky, Unbounded ocean heaved. Day after day Before the steady gale we drove along, . . Day after day! The fourth week now had past; Still all around was sea, . . the eternal sea! So long that we had voyaged on so fast, And still at morning where we were at night, And where we were at morn, at nightfall still, The centre of that drear circumference, Progressive, yet no change! . . almost it seem'd That we had pass'd the mortal bounds of space, And speed was toiling in infinity. My days were days of fear, my hours of rest Were like a tyrant's slumber. Sullen looks, Eyes turn'd on me, and whispers meant to meet My ear, and loud despondency, and talk Of home, now never to be seen again, . . I suffer'd these, dissembling as I could, Till that avail'd no longer. Resolute The men came round me: They had shown enough Of courage now, enough of constancy; Still to pursue the desperate enterprize Were impious madness! they had deem'd, indeed, That Heaven in favour gave the unchanging gale; . . More reason now to think offended God, When man's presumptuous folly strove to pass The fated limits of the world, had sent His winds, to waft us to the death we sought. Their lives were dear, they bade me know, and they Many, and I, the obstinate, but one. With that, attending no reply, they hailed Our fellow bark, and told their fix'd resolve. A shout of joy approved. Thus, desperate now, I sought my solitary cabin; there Confused with vague tumultuous feelings lay, And to remembrance and reflection lost, Knew only I was wretched. Thus entranced Cadwallon found me; shame, and grief, and pride, And baffled hope, and fruitless anger swell'd Within me. All is over! I exclaim'd; Yet not in me, my friend, hath time produced These tardy doubts and shameful fickleness; I have not fail'd, Cadwallon! Nay, he said, The coward fears which persecuted me Have shown what thou hast suffer'd. We have yet One hope... I pray'd them to proceed a day, . . But one day more; . . this little have I gain'd, And here will wait the issue; in yon bark I am not needed, . . they are masters there. One only day! . . The gale blew strong, the bark Sped through the waters; but the silent hours, Who make no pause, went by; and center'd still, We saw the dreary vacancy of heaven Close round our narrow view, when that brief term, The last poor respite of our hopes expired. They shorten'd sail, and call'd with coward prayer For homeward winds. Why, what poor slaves are we, In bitterness I cried; the sport of chance; Left to the mercy of the elements, Or the more wayward will of such as these, Blind tools and victims of their destiny! Yea, Madoc! he replied, the Elements Master indeed the feeble powers of man! Not to the shores of Cambria will thy ships Win back their shameful way! . . or He, whose will Unchains the winds, hath bade them minister To aid us, when all human hope was gone, Or we shall soon eternally repose From life's long voyage. As he spake, I saw The clouds hang thick and heavy o'er the deep, And heavily, upon the long slow swell, The vessel labour'd on the labouring sea. The reef-points rattled on the shivering sail; At fits the sudden gust howl'd ominous, Anon with unremitting fury raged; High roll'd the mighty billows, and the blast Swept from their sheeted sides the showery foam. Vain now were all the seamen's homeward hopes, Vain all their skill! . . we drove before the storm. 'Tis pleasant, by the cheerful hearth, to hear Of tempests and the dangers of the deep, And pause at times, and feel that we are safe; Then listen to the perilous tale again, And with an eager and suspended soul, Woo terror to delight us.... But to hear The roaring of the raging elements, . . To know all human skill, all human strength, Avail not, . . to look round, and only see The mountain wave incumbent with its weight Of bursting waters o'er the reeling bark, . . . O God, this is indeed a dreadful thing! And he who hath endured the horror once Of such an hour, doth never hear the storm Howl round his home, but he remembers it, And thinks upon the suffering mariner. Onward we drove: with unabating force The tempest raged; night added to the storm New horrors, and the morn arose o'erspread With heavier clouds. The weary mariners Call'd on Saint Cyric's aid; and I too placed My hope on Heaven, relaxing not the while Our human efforts. Ye who dwell at home, Ye do not know the terrors of the main! When the winds blow, ye walk along the shore, And as the curling billows leap and toss, Fable that Ocean's mermaid Shepherdess Drives her white flocks afield, and warns in time The wary fisherman. Gwenhidwy warned When we had no retreat! My secret heart Almost had fail'd me... Were the Elements Confounded in perpetual conflict here, Sea, Air, and Heaven? Or were we perishing Where at their source the Floods, for ever thus, Beneath the nearer influence of the Moon, Labour'd in these mad workings? Did the Waters Here on their outmost circle meet the Void, The verge and brink of Chaos? Or this Earth, . . Was it indeed a living thing, . . its breath The ebb and flow of Ocean? and had we Reached the storm rampart of its Sanctuary, The insuperable boundary, raised to guard Its mysteries from the eye of man profane? Three dreadful nights and days we drove along; The fourth, the welcome rain came rattling down, The wind had fallen, and through the broken cloud Appeared the bright dilating blue of heaven. Embolden'd now, I call'd the mariners: . . Vain were it should we bend a homeward course, Driven by the storm so far: they saw our barks, For service of that long and perilous way Disabled, and our food belike to fail. Silent they heard, reluctant in assent; Anon, they shouted joyfully, . . I look'd And saw a bird slow sailing overhead, His long white pinions by the sunbeam edged As though with burnish'd silver; . . never yet Heard I so sweet a music as his cry! Yet three days more, and hope more eager now, Sure of the signs of land, . . weed-shoals, and birds Who flock'd the main, and gentle airs which breathed, Or seemed to breathe, fresh fragrance from the shore. On the last evening, a long shadowy line Skirted the sea; . . how fast the night closed in! I stood upon the deck, and watch'd till dawn. But who can tell what feelings fill'd my heart, When like a cloud the distant land arose Grey from the ocean, . . when we left the ship, And cleft, with rapid oars, the shallow wave, And stood triumphant on another world! V. LINCOYA. Madoc had paused awhile; but every eye Still watch'd his lips, and every voice was hush'd. Soon as I leapt ashore, pursues the Lord Of Ocean, prostrate on my face I fell, Kiss'd the dear earth, and pray'd with thankful tears. Hard by a brook was flowing; . . never yet, Even from the gold-tipt horn of victory With harp and song amid my father's hall, Pledged I so sweet a draught, as lying there, Beside that streamlet's brink! . . to feel the ground, To quaff the cool clear water, to inhale The breeze of land, while fears and dangers past Recurr'd and heighten'd joy, as summer storms Make the fresh evening lovelier! To the shore The natives throng'd; astonish'd, they beheld Our winged barks, and gazed with wonderment On the strange garb, the bearded countenance And the white skin, in all unlike themselves. I see with what enquiring eyes you ask What men were they? Of dark-brown colour, tinged With sunny redness; wild of eye; their brows So smooth, as never yet anxiety Nor busy thought had made a furrow there; Beardless, and each to each of lineaments So like, they seem'd but one great family. Their loins were loosely cinctured, all beside Bare to the sun and wind; and thus their limbs Unmanacled display'd the truest forms Of strength and beauty. Fearless sure they were, And while they eyed us grasp'd their spears, as if, Like Britain's injured but unconquer'd sons, They too had known how perilous it was To let a stranger, if he came in arms, Set foot upon their land. But soon the guise Of men nor purporting nor fearing ill, Gain'd confidence; their wild distrustful looks Assumed a milder meaning; over one I cast my mantle, on another's head The velvet bonnet placed, and all was joy. We now besought for food; at once they read Our gestures, but I cast a hopeless eye On hills and thickets, woods, and marshy plains, A waste of rank luxuriance all around. Thus musing to a lake I follow'd them, Left when the rivers to their summer course Withdrew; they scatter'd on its water drugs Of such strange potency, that soon the shoals Coop'd there by Nature prodigally kind, Floated inebriate. As I gazed, a deer Sprung from the bordering thicket; the true shaft Scarce with the distant victim's blood had stain'd Its point, when instantly he dropt and died, Such deadly juice imbued it; yet on this We made our meal unharm'd; and I perceived The wisest leech that ever in our world Cull'd herbs of hidden virtue, was to these A child in knowledge. Sorrowing we beheld The night come on; but soon did night display More wonders than it veil'd: innumerous tribes From the wood-cover swarm'd, and darkness made Their beauties visible; one while they stream'd A bright blue radiance upon flowers which closed Their gorgeous colours from the eye of day; Now motionless and dark eluded search, Self-shrouded; and anon starring the sky Rose like a shower of fire. Our friendly hosts Now led us to the hut, our that night's home, A rude and spacious dwelling: twisted boughs, And canes and withies formed the walls and roof; And from the unhewn trunks which pillar'd it, Low nets of interwoven reeds were hung. With shouts of honour here they gather'd round me, Ungarmented my limbs, and in a net With softest feathers lined, a pleasant couch, They laid and left me. To our ships return'd, After soft sojourn here we coasted on, Insatiate of the wonders and the charms Of earth and air and sea. Thy summer woods Are lovely, O my mother isle! the birch Light bending on thy banks, thy elmy vales, Thy venerable oaks! . . . But there, what forms Of beauty clothed the inlands and the shore! All these in stateliest growth, and mixt with these Dark spreading cedar, and the cypress tall, Its pointed summit waving to the wind Like a long beacon flame; and loveliest Amid a thousand strange and lovely shapes, The lofty palm, that with its nuts supplied Beverage and food; they edged the shore and crown'd The far-off highland summits, their straight stems Bare without leaf or bough, erect and smooth, Their tresses nodding like a crested helm, The plumage of the grove. Will ye believe The wonders of the ocean? how its shoals Sprang from the wave, like flashing light, . . took wing, And twinkling with a silver glitterance, Flew through the air and sunshine? yet were these To sight less wondrous than the tribe who swam, Following like fowlers with uplifted eye Their falling quarry: . . language cannot paint Their splendid tints; though in blue ocean seen, Blue, darkly, deeply, beautifully blue, In all its rich variety of shades, Suffused with glowing gold. Heaven too had there Its wonders: . . . from a deep, black, heavy cloud, What shall I say? . . a shoot, . . a trunk, . . an arm Came down: . . yea! like a Demon's arm, it seized The waters, Ocean smoked beneath its touch, And rose like dust before the whirlwind's force. But we sail'd onward over tranquil seas, Wafted by airs so exquisitely mild, That even to breathe became an act of will And sense and pleasure. Not a cloud by day With purple islanded the dark-blue deep; By night the quiet billows heaved and glanced Under the moon, . . that heavenly Moon! so bright, That many a midnight have I paced the deck, Forgetful of the hours of due repose; Yea till the Sun in his full majesty Went forth, like God beholding his own works. Once when a chief was feasting us on shore, A captive served the food: I mark'd the youth, For he had features of a gentler race; And oftentimes his eye was fix'd on me, With looks of more than wonder. We return'd At evening to our ships; at night a voice Came from the sea, the intelligible voice Of earnest supplication: he had swum To trust our mercy; up the side he sprang, And look'd among the crew, and singling me Fell at my feet. Such friendly tokenings As our short commerce with the native tribes Had taught, I proffer'd, and sincerity Gave force and meaning to the half-learnt forms. For one we needed who might speak for us; And well I liked the youth,—the open lines Which character'd his face, the fearless heart, Which gave at once and won full confidence. So that night at my feet Lincoya slept. When I display'd whate'er might gratify, Whate'er surprise, with most delight he view'd Our arms, the iron helm, the pliant mail, The buckler strong to save; and then he shook The lance, and grasp'd the sword, and turn'd to me With vehement words and gestures, every limb Working with one strong passion; and he placed The falchion in my hand, and gave the shield, And pointed south and west, that I should go To conquer and protect; anon he wept Aloud, and clasp'd my knees, and falling fain He would have kiss'd my feet. Went we to shore? Then would he labour restlessly to show A better place lay on ward; and in the sand, To south and west he drew the line of coast, And figured how a mighty river there Ran to the sea. The land bent westward soon, And thus confirm'd we voyaged on to seek The river inlet, following at the will Of our new friend: and we learnt after him, Well pleased and proud to teach, what this was call'd What that, with no unprofitable pains. Nor light the joy I felt at hearing first The pleasant accents of my native tongue, Albeit in broken words and tones uncouth, Come from these foreign lips. At length we came Where the great river, amid shoals and banks And islands, growth of its own gathering spoils, Through many a branching channel, wide and full, Rush'd to the main. The gale was strong; and safe, Amid the uproar of conflicting tides, Our gallant vessels rode. A stream as broad And turbid, when it leaves the Land of Hills, Old Severn rolls; but banks so fair as these Old Severn views not in his Land of Hills, Nor even where his turbid waters swell And sully the salt sea. So we sail'd on By shores now cover'd with impervious woods, Now stretching wide and low, a reedy waste, And now through vales where earth profusely pour'd Her treasures, gather'd from the first of days. Sometimes a savage tribe would welcome us, By wonder from their lethargy of life Awaken'd; then again we voyaged on Through tracts all desolate, for days and days, League after league, one green and fertile mead, That fed a thousand herds. A different scene Rose on our view, of mount on mountain piled, Which when I see again in memory, Star-gazing Idris's stupendous seat Seems dwarf'd, and Snowdon with its eagle haunts Shrinks, and is dwindled like a Saxon hill. Here with Cadwallon and a chosen band, I left the ships. Lincoya guided us A toilsome way among the heights; at dusk We reach'd the village skirts; he bade us halt, And raised his voice; the elders of the land Came forth, and led us to an ample hut, Which in the centre of their dwellings stood, The Stranger's House. They eyed us wondering, Yet not for wonder ceased they to observe Their hospitable rites; from hut to hut The tidings ran that strangers were arrived, Fatigued and hungry and athirst; anon, Each from his means supplying us, came food And beverage such as cheers the weary man. VI. ERILLYAB. At morning their high-priest Ayayaca Came with our guide: the venerable man With reverential awe accosted us, For we, he ween'd, were children of a race Mightier than they, and wiser, and by heaven Beloved and favour'd more: he came to give Fit welcome, and he led us to the Queen. The fate of war had reft her of her realm; Yet with affection and habitual awe, And old remembrances, which gave their love A deeper and religious character, Fallen as she was, and humbled as they were, Her faithful people still in all they could Obey'd Erillyab. She too in her mind Those recollections cherish'd, and such thoughts As, though no hope allay'd their bitterness, Gave to her eye a spirit and a strength, And pride to features which belike had borne, Had they been fashion'd by a happier fate, Meaning more gentle and more womanly, Yet not more worthy of esteem and love. She sate upon the threshold of her hut; For in the palace where her sires had reign'd The conqueror dwelt. Her son was at her side, A boy now near to manhood; by the door, Bare of its bark, the head and branches shorn, Stood a young tree with many a weapon hung, Her husband's war-pole, and his monument. There had his quiver moulder'd, his stone-axe Had there grown green with moss, his bow-string there Sung as it cut the wind. She welcom'd us With a proud sorrow in her mien; fresh fruits Were spread before us, and her gestures said That when he lived whose hand was wont to wield Those weapons, . . that in better days, . . that ere She let the tresses of her widowhood Grow wild, she could have given to guests like us A worthier welcome. Soon a man approach'd, Hooded with sable, his half-naked limbs Smear'd black; the people at his sight drew round, The women wail'd and wept, the children turn'd And hid their faces on their mothers' knees. He to the Queen addrest his speech, then look'd Around the children, and laid hands on two, Of different sexes but of age alike Some six years each, who at his touch shriek'd out. But then Lincoya rose, and to my feet Led them, and told me that the conquerors claim'd These innocents for tribute; that the Priest Would lay them on the altar of his god, Pluck out their little hearts in sacrifice, And with his brotherhood in impious rites Feast on their flesh! . . I shudder'd, and my hand Instinctively unsheathed the avenging sword, As he with passionate and eloquent signs, Eye-speaking earnestness and quivering lips, Besought me to preserve himself, and those Who now fell suppliant round me, . . youths and maids, Grey-headed men, and mothers with their babes. I caught the little victims up, I kiss'd Their innocent cheeks, I raised my eyes to heaven, I call'd upon Almighty God to hear And bless the vow I made; in our own tongue Was that sworn promise of protection pledged.. Impetuous feeling made no pause for thought. Heaven heard the vow; the suppliant multitude Saw what was stirring in my heart; the Priest, With eye inflamed and rapid answer, raised His menacing hand; the tone, the bitter smile, Interpreting his threat. Meanwhile the Queen, With watchful eye and steady countenance, Had listen'd; now she rose and to the Priest Address'd her speech. Low was her voice and calm, As one who spake with effort to subdue Sorrow that struggled still; but while she spake, Her features kindled to more majesty, Her eye became more animate, her voice Rose to the height of feeling; on her son She call'd, and from her husband's monument His battle-axe she took; and I could see, That when she gave the boy his father's arms, She call'd his father's spirit to look on And bless them to his vengeance. Silently The tribe stood listening as Erillyab spake The very Priest was awed: once he essayed To answer; his tongue fail'd him, and his lip Grew pale and fell. He to his countrymen Of rage and shame and wonder full, return'd, Bearing no victims for their shrines accurst, But tidings that the Hoamen had cast off Their vassalage, roused to desperate revolt By men in hue and speech and garment strange, Who in their folly dared defy the power Of Aztlan. When the King of Aztlan heard The unlook'd-for tale, ere yet he roused his strength, Or pitying our rash valour, or perhaps Curious to see the man so bravely rash, He sent to bid me to his court. Surprised, I should have given to him no credulous faith, But fearlessly Erillyab bade me trust Her honourable foe. Unarm'd I went, Lincoya with me to exchange our speech So as he could, of safety first assured; For to their devilish idols he had been A victim doomed, and from the bloody rites Flying been carried captive far away. From early morning till the midnoon hour We travell'd in the mountains; then a plain Open'd below, and rose upon the sight, Like boundless ocean from a hill-top seen. A beautiful and populous plain it was; Fair woods were there and fertilizing streams, And pastures spreading wide, and villages In fruitful groves embower'd, and stately towns, And many a single dwelling specking it, As though for many a year the land had been The land of peace. Below us, where the base Of the great mountain to the level sloped, A broad blue lake extended far and wide Its waters, dark beneath the light of noon. There Aztlan stood upon the farther shore: Amid the shade of trees its dwellings rose, Their level roofs with turrets set around, And battlements all burnish'd white, which shone Like silver in the sunshine. I beheld The imperial city, her far-circling walls, Her garden groves and stately palaces, Her temple's mountain-size, her thousand roofs; And when I saw her might and majesty My mind misgave me then. We reach'd the shore: A floating islet waited for me there, The beautiful work of man. I set my feet Upon green-growing herbs and flowers, and sate Embower'd in odorous shrubs: four long light boats Yoked to the garden, with accordant song, And dip and dash of oar in harmony, Bore me across the lake. Then in a car Aloft by human bearers was I borne; And through the city gate, and through long lines Of marshall'd multitudes who throng'd the way, We reach'd the palace court. Fourpriests were there; Each held a burning censer in his hand, And strew'd the precious gum as I drew nigh, And held the steaming fragrance forth to me, Honouring me like a god. They led me in, Where on his throne the royal Azteca Coanocotzin sate. Stranger, said he, Welcome; and be this coming to thy weal! A desperate warfare doth thy courage court; But thou shalt see the people and the power Whom thy deluded zeal would call to arms; So may the knowledge make thee timely wise. The valiant love the valiant... Come with me! So saying he rose; we went together forth To the Great Temple. 'Twas a huge square hill, Or rather like a rock it seemed, hewn out And squared by patient labour. Never yet Did our forefathers, o'er beloved chief Fallen in his glory, heap a monument Of that prodigious bulk, though every shield Was laden for his grave, and every hand Toil'd unremitting at the willing work From morn till eve, all the long summer day. The ascent was lengthen'd with provoking art, By steps which led but to a wearying path Round the whole structure; then another flight, Another road around, and thus a third, And yet a fourth, before we reach'd the height. Lo, now, Coanocotzin cried, thou seest The cities of this widely peopled plain; And wert thou on yon farthest temple-top, Yet as far onward wouldst thou see the land Well husbanded like this, and full of men. They tell me that two floating palaces Brought thee and all thy people; . . when I sound The Tambour of the God, ten Cities hear Its voice, and answer to the call in arms. In truth I felt my weakness, and the view Had wakened no unreasonable fear, But that a nearer sight had stirr'd my blood; For on the summit where we stood four Towers Were piled with human skulls, and all around Long files of human heads were strung to parch And whiten in the sun. What then I felt Was more than natural courage... 'twas a trust In more than mortal strength... a faith in God, . . Yea, inspiration from Him! . . . I exclaimed, Not though ten Cities ten times told obey'd The King of Aztlan's bidding, should I fear The power of man! Art thou then more than man? He answered; and I saw his tawny cheek Lose its life-colour as the fear arose; Nor did I undeceive him from that fear, For sooth I knew not how to answer him, And therefore let it work. So not a word Spake he, till we again had reach'd the court, And I too went in silent thoughtfulness: But then when, save Lincoya, there was none To hear our speech, again did he renew The query, . . Stranger! art thou more than man, That thou shouldst set the power of man at nought? Then I replied, Two floating Palaces Bore me and all my people o'er the seas. When we departed from our mother-land, The Moon was newly born; we saw her wax And wane, and witnessed her new birth again; And all that while, alike by day and night, We travell'd through the sea, and caught the winds, And made them bear us forward. We must meet In battle, if the Hoamen are not freed From your accursed tribute, . . thou and I, My people and thy countless multitudes. Your arrows shall fall from us as the hail Leaps on a rock, . . and when ye smite with swords, Not blood but fire shall follow from the stroke. Yet think not thou that we are more than men! Our knowledge is our power, and God our strength, God, whose almighty will created thee, And me, and all that hath the breath of life. He is our strength; . . for in His name I speak, . . And when I tell thee that thou shalt not shed The life of man in bloody sacrifice, It is His holy bidding which I speak: And if thou wilt not listen and obey, When I shall meet thee in the battle-field, It is His holy cause for which I fight, And I shall have His power to vanquish thee! And thinkest thou our Gods are feeble? cried The King of Aztlan; thinkest thou they lack Power to defend their altars, and to keep The kingdom which they gave us strength to win? The Gods of thirty nations have opposed Their irresistible might, and they lie now Conquer'd and caged and fetter'd at their feet. That we who serve them are no coward race, Let prove the ample realm we won in arms: . . And I their leader am not of the sons Of the feeble! As he spake, he reach'd a mace, The trunk and knotted root of some young tree, Such as old Albion and his monster-brood From the oak-forest for their weapons pluck'd, When father Brute and Corineus set foot On the White Island first. Lo this, quoth he, My club! and he threw back his robe; and this The arm that wields it! . . 'Twas my father's once: Erillyab's husband, King Tepollomi, He felt its weight... Did I not show thee him? He lights me at my evening banquet. There, In very deed, the dead Tepollomi Stood up against the wall, by devilish art Preserv'd; and from his black and shrivell'd hand The steady lamp hung down. My spirit rose At that abomination; I exclaim'd Thou art of noble nature, and full fain Would I in friendship plight my hand with thine; But till that body in the grave be laid, Till thy polluted altars be made pure, There is no peace between us. May my God, Who, though thou know'st him not, is also thine, And after death will be thy dreadful Judge, May it please Him to visit thee, and shed His mercy on thy soul! . . . But if thy heart Be harden'd to the proof, come when thou wilt! I know thy power, and thou shalt then know mine. VII. THE BATTLE. Now then to meet the war! Erillyab's call Roused all her people to revenge their wrongs; And at Lincoya's voice, the mountain tribes Arose and broke their bondage. I meantime Took counsel with Cadwallon and his sire, And told them of the numbers we must meet, And what advantage from the mountain-straits I thought, as in the Saxon wars, to win. Thou saw'st their weapons then Cadwallon said; Are they like these rude works of ignorance, Bone-headed shafts, and spears of wood, and shields Strong only for such strife? We had to cope With wiser enemies, and abler arm'd. What for the sword they wielded was a staff Set thick with stones athwart; you would have deem'd The uncouth shape was cumbrous; but a hand Expert, and practised to its use, could drive The sharpen'd flints with deadly impulse down. Their mail, if mail it may be call'd, was woven Of vegetable down, like finest flax, Bleach'd to the whiteness of the new-fallen snow To every bend and motion flexible, Light as a warrior's summer-garb in peace; Yet, in that lightest, softest, habergeon Harmless the sharp stone arrow-head would hang. Others, of higher office, were array'd In feathery breast-plates of more gorgeous hue Than the gay plumage of the mountain-cock, Or pheasant's glittering pride. But what were these, Or what the thin gold hauberk, when opposed To arms like ours in battle? What the mail Of wood fire-harden'd, or the wooden helm, Against the iron arrows of the South, Against our northern spears, or battle-axe, Or good sword, wielded by a British hand? Then, quoth Cadwallon, at the wooden helm, Of these weak arms the weakest, let the sword Hew, and the spear be thrust. The mountaineers, So long inured to crouch beneath their yoke, We will not trust in battle; from the heights They with their arrows may annoy the foe; And when our closer strife has won the fray, Then let them loose for havoc. O my son, Exclaim'd the blind old man, thou counsellest ill! Blood will have blood, revenge beget revenge, Evil must come of evil. We shall win, Certes, a cheap and easy victory In the first field; their arrows from our arms Will fall, and on the hauberk and the helm The flint-edge blunt and break; while through their limbs, Naked, or vainly fenced, the griding steel Shall sheer its mortal way. But what are we Against a nation? Other hosts will rise In endless warfare, with perpetual fights Dwindling our all-too-few; or multitudes Will wear and weary us, till we sink subdued By the very toil of conquest. Ye are strong; But he who puts his trust in mortal strength Leans on a broken reed. First prove your power; Be in the battle terrible, but spare The fallen, and follow not the flying foe: Then may ye win a nobler victory, So dealing with the captives as to fill Their hearts with wonder, gratitude, and awe, That love shall mingle with their fear, and fear 'Stablish the love, else wavering. Let them see, That as more pure and gentle is your faith, Yourselves are gentler, purer. Ye shall be As gods among them, if ye thus obey God's precepts. Soon the mountain tribes, in arms Rose at Lincoya's call: a numerous host, More than in numbers, in the memory Of long oppression, and revengeful hope, A formidable foe. I station'd them Where at the entrance of the rocky straights, Secure themselves, their arrows might command The coming army. On the plain below We took our stand, between the mountain-base And the green margin of the waters. Soon Their long array came on. Oh what a pomp And pride and pageantry of war was there! Not half so gaudied, for their May-day mirth, All wreathed and ribanded, our youths and maids, As these stern Aztecas in war attire! The golden glitterance, and the feather-mail, More gay than glittering gold; and round the helm A coronal of high upstanding plumes Green as the spring grass in a sunny shower; Or scarlet bright, as in the wintry wood The cluster'd holly; or of purple tint, . . Whereto shall that be liken'd? to what gem Indiadem'd, . . what flower, . . what insect's wing? With war-songs and wild music they came on, We the while kneeling, raised with one accord The hymn of supplication. Front to front, And now the embattled armies stood: a band Of priests, all sable-garmented, advanced; They piled a heap of sedge before our host, And warn'd us, . . Sons of Ocean! from the land Of Aztlan, while ye may, depart in peace! Before the fire shall be extinguish'd, hence! Or, even as yon dry sedge amid the flame, So ye shall be consumed... The arid heap They kindled, and the rapid flame ran up, And blazed, and died away. Then from his bow, With steady hand, their chosen archer loosed The Arrow of the Omen. To its mark The shaft of divination fled; it smote Cadwallon's plated breast; the brittle point Rebounded. He, contemptuous of their faith, Stoopt for the shaft, and while with zealous speed To the rescue they rushed onward, snapping it Asunder, toss'd the fragments back in scorn. Fierce was their onset; never in the field Encounter'd I with braver enemies. Nor marvel ye, nor think it to their shame, If soon they stagger'd, and gave way, and fled, So many from so few; they saw their darts Recoil, their lances shiver, and their swords Fall ineffectual, blunted with the blow. Think ye no shame of Aztlan that they fled, When the bowmen of Deheubarth plied so well Their shafts with fatal aim; through the thin gold, Or feather-mail, while Gwyneth's deep-driven spears Pierced to the bone and vitals; when they saw The falchion, flashing late so lightning-like, Quench'd in their own life-blood. Our mountaineers Shower'd from the heights, meantime, an arrowystorm, Themselves secure; and we who bore the brunt Of battle, iron men, impassible, Stood in our strength unbroken. Marvel not If then the brave felt fear, already impress'd That day by ominous thoughts, to fear akin; For so it chanced, high Heaven ordaining so, The King, who should have led his people forth, At the army-head, as they began their march, Was with sore sickness stricken; and the stroke Came like the act and arm of very God, So suddenly, and in that point of time. A gallant man was he, who, in his stead, That day commanded Aztlan; his long hair, Tufted with many a cotton lock, proclaim'd Of princely prowess many a feat achieved In many a field of fame. Oft had he led The Aztecas, with happy fortune, forth; Yet could not now Yuhidthiton inspire His host with hope: he, not the less, that day, True to his old renown, and in the hour Of rout and ruin with collected mind, Sounded his signals shrill, and in the voice Of loud reproach and anger, and brave shame, Call'd on the people... But when nought avail'd, Seizing the standard from the timid hand Which held it in dismay, alone he turn'd, For honourable death resolved, and praise That would not die. Thereat the braver chiefs Rallied, anew their signals rung around, And Aztlan, seeing how we spared her flight, Took heart, and roll'd the tide of battle back. But when Cadwallon from the chieftain's grasp Had cut the standard-staff away, and stunn'd And stretch'd him at his mercy on the field; Then fled the enemy in utter rout, Broken and quell'd at heart. One chief alone Bestrode the body of Yuhidthiton; Bareheaded did young Malinal bestride His brother's body, wiping from his brow With the shield-hand the blinding blood away, And dealing franticly with broken sword Obstinate wrath, the last resisting foe. Him, in his own despite, we seized and saved. Then in the moment of our victory, We purified our hands from blood, and knelt, And pour'd to heaven the grateful prayer of praise, And raised the choral psalm. Triumphant thus To the hills we went our way; the mountaineers With joy, and dissonant song, and antic dance; The captives sullenly, deeming that they went To meet the certain death of sacrifice, Yet stern and undismay'd. We bade them know Ours was a law of mercy and of love; We heal'd their wounds, and set the prisoners free. Bear ye, quoth I, my bidding to your King; Say to him, Did the Stranger speak to thee The words of truth, and hath he proved his power? Thus saith the Lord of Ocean, in the name Of God, Almighty, Universal God, Thy Judge and mine, whose battles I have fought, Whose bidding I obey, whose will I speak; Shed thou no more in impious sacrifice The life of man; restore unto the grave The dead Tepollomi; set this people free, And peace shall be between us. On the morrow Came messengers from Aztlan, in reply. Coanocotzin with sore malady Hath, by the Gods, been stricken: will the Lord Of Ocean visit his sick bed? . . He told Of wrath, and as he said, the vengeance came: Let him bring healing now, and 'stablish peace. VIII. THE PEACE. Again, and now with better hope, I sought The city of the King: there went with me Iolo, old Iolo, he who knows The virtue of all herbs of mount or vale, Or greenwood shade, or quiet brooklet's bed; Whatever lore of science, or of song, Sages and Bards of old have handed down. Aztlan that day pour'd forth her swarming sons, To wait my coming. Will he ask his God To stay the hand of anger? was the cry, The general cry, . . and will he save the King? Coanocotzin too had nurst that thought, And the strong hope upheld him: he put forth His hand, and raised a quick and anxious eye, . . Is it not peace and mercy? . . thou art come To pardon and to save! I answer'd him, That power, O King of Aztlan, is not mine! Such help as human cunning can bestow, Such human help I bring; but health and life Are in the hand of God, who at his will Gives or withdraws; and what he wills is best. Then old Iolo took his arm, and felt The symptom, and he bade him have good hope, For life was strong within him. So it proved; The drugs of subtle virtue did their work; They quell'd the venom of the malady, And from the frame expell'd it, . . that a sleep Fell on the King, a sweet and natural sleep, And from its healing he awoke refresh'd Though weak, and joyful as a man who felt The peril past away. Ere long we spake Of concord, and how best to knit the bonds Of lasting friendship. When we won this land, Coanocotzin said, these fertile vales Were not, as now, with fruitful groves embower'd, Nor rich with towns and populous villages, Abounding, as thou seest, with life and joy: Our fathers found bleak heath, and desert moor, Wild woodland, and savannahs wide and waste, Rude country of rude dwellers. From our arms They to the mountain fastnesses retired, And long with obstinate and harassing war Provoked us, hoping not for victory, Yet mad for vengeance: till Tepollomi Fell by my father's hand; and with their King, The strength and flower of all their youth cut off, All in one desolating day, they took The yoke upon their necks. What wouldest thou That to these Hoamen I should now concede? Lord of the Ocean, speak! Let them be free! Quoth I. I come not from my native isle To wage the war of conquest, and cast out Your people from the land which time and toil Have rightly made their own. The land is wide; There is enough for all. So they be freed From that accursed tribute, and ye shed The life of man no more in sacrifice, In the most holy name of God I say, Let there be peace between us! Thou hast won Their liberty, the King replied: henceforth, Free as they are, if they provoke the war, Reluctantly will Aztlan raise her arm. Be thou the peace-preserver. To what else Thou say'st, instructed by calamity, I lend a humble ear; but to destroy The worship of my fathers, or abate Or change one point, lies not within the reach And scope of kingly power. Speak thou hereon With those whom we hold holy, with the sons Of the Temple, they who commune with the Gods; Awe them, for they awe me. So we resolved That when the bones of King Tepollomi Had had their funeral honours, they and I Should by the green-lake side, before the King, And in the presence of the people, hold A solemn talk. Then to the mountain-huts. The bearer of good tidings, I return'd Leading the honourable train who bore The relics of the King; not parch'd and black, As I had seen the unnatural corpse stand up, In ghastly mockery of the attitude And act of life; . . his bones had now been blanch'd With decent reverence. Soon the mountaineers Saw the white deer-skin shroud; the rumour spread; They gather'd round, and follow'd in our train. Before Erillyab's hut the bearers laid Their burden down. She, calm of countenance, And with dry eye, albeit her hand the while Shook like an agueish limb, unroll'd the shroud. The multitude stood gazing silently, The young and old alike all awed and hush'd Under the holy feeling, . . and the hush Was aweful; that huge multitude so still, That we could hear distinct the mountain-stream Roll down its rocky channel far away And this was all; sole ceremony this, The sight of death and silence, . . till at length, In the ready grave his bones were laid to rest. 'Twas in her hut and home, yea, underneath The marriage bed, the bed of widowhood, Her husband's grave was dug; on softest fur The bones were laid, with fur were covered o'er, Then heap'd with bark and boughs, and, last of all, Earth was to earth trod down. And now the day Appointed for our talk of peace was come. On the green margin of the lake we met, Elders, and Priests, and Chiefs; the multitude Around the Circle of the Council stood. Then, in the midst, Coanocotzin rose, And thus the King began: Pabas, and Chiefs Of Aztlan, hither ye are come to learn The law of peace. The Lord of Ocean saith, The Tribes whom he hath gathered underneath The wings of his protection, shall be free; And in the name of his great God he saith, That ye shall never shed in sacrifice The blood of man. Are ye content? that so We may together here, in happy hour, Bury the sword. Hereat a Paba rose, And answer'd for his brethren: . . He hath won The Hoamen's freedom, that their blood no more Shall on our altars flow; for this the Lord Of Ocean fought, and Aztlan yielded it In battle. But if we forego the rites Of our forefathers, if we wrong the Gods, Who give us timely sun and timely showers, Their wrath will be upon us; they will shut Their ears to prayer, and turn away the eyes Which watch for our well-doing, and withhold The hands dispensing our prosperity. Cynetha then arose, between his son And me supported, rose the blind old man. Ye wrong us, men of Aztlan, if ye deem We bid ye wrong the Gods; accurst were he Who would obey such bidding, . . more accurst The wretch who should enjoin impiety. It is the will of God which we make known, Your God and ours. Know ye not Him who laid The deep foundations of the earth, and built The arch of heaven, and kindled yonder sun, And breathed into the woods and waves and sky The power of life? We know Him, they replied, The great For-Ever One, the God of Gods, Ipalnemoani, He by whom we live! And we too, quoth Ayayaca, we know And worship the Great Spirit, who in clouds And storms, in mountain caves, and by the fall Of waters, in the woodland solitude, And in the night and silence of the sky, Doth make his being felt. We also know, And fear, and worship the Beloved One. Our God, replied Cynetha, is the same, The Universal Father. He to the first Made his will known; but when men multiplied, The Evil Spirits darken'd them, and sin And misery came into the world, and men Forsook the way of truth, and gave to stocks And stones the incommunicable name. Yet with one chosen, one peculiar Race, The knowledge of their Father and their God Remain'd, from sire to son transmitted down. While the bewilder'd Nations of the earth Wander'd in fogs, and were in darkness lost, The light abode with them; and when at times They sinn'd and went astray, the Lord hath put A voice into the mouths of holy men, Raising up witnesses unto himself, That so the saving knowledge of his name Might never fail; nor the glad promise, given To our first parent, that at length his sons, From error, sin, and wretchedness redeem'd, Should form one happy family of love. Nor ever hath that light, howe'er bedimm'd, Wholly been quench d; still in the heart of man A feeling and an instinct it exists, His very nature's stamp and privilege, Yea, of his life the life. I tell ye not, O Aztecas! of things unknown before; I do but waken up a living sense That sleeps within ye! Do ye love the Gods Who call for blood? Doth the poor sacrifice Go with a willing step, to lay his life Upon their altars? . . Good must come of good, Evil of evil; if the fruit be death, The poison springeth from the sap and root, And the whole tree is deadly; if the rites Be evil, they who claim them are not good, Not to be worshipp'd then; for to obey The evil will is evil. Aztecas! From the For-Ever, the Beloved One, The Universal Only God I speak, Your God and mine, our Father and our Judge. Hear ye his law, . . hear ye the perfect law Of love, “Do ye to others, as ye would That they should do to you!” He bids us meet To praise his name, in thankfulness and joy; He bids us, in our sorrow, pray to him, The Comforter. Love him, for he is good! Fear him, for he is just! Obey his will, For who can bear his anger! While he spake, They stood with open mouth, and motionless sight, Watching his countenance, as though the voice Were of a God; for sure it seem'd that less Than inspiration could not have infused That eloquent passion in a blind man's face. And when he ceased, all eyes at once were turn'd Upon the Pabas, waiting their reply, If that to that acknowledged argument Reply could be devised. But they themselves, Stricken by the truth, were silent; and they look'd Toward their chief and mouth-piece, the High Priest Tezozomoc; he too was pale and mute, And when he gather'd up his strength to speak, Speech fail'd him, his lip falter'd, and his eye Fell utterly abash'd, and put to shame. But in the Chiefs, and in the multitude, And in the King of Aztlan, better thoughts Were working; for the Spirit of the Lord That day was moving in the heart of man. Coanocotzin rose: Pabas, and Chiefs, And men of Aztlan, ye have heard a talk Of peace and love, and there is no reply. Are ye content with what the Wise Man saith? And will ye worship God in that good way Which God himself ordains? If it be so, Together here will we in happy hour Bury the sword. Tezozomoc replied, This thing is new, and in the land till now Unheard: . . what marvel, therefore, if we find No ready answer? Let our Lord the King Do that which seemeth best. Yuhidthiton, Chief of the Chiefs of Aztlan, next arose. Of all her numerous sons, could Aztlan boast No mightier arm in battle, nor whose voice To more attentive silence hush'd the hall Of council. When the Wise Man spake, quoth he, I ask'd of mine own heart if it were so, And, as he said, the living instinct there Answer'd, and own'd the truth. In happy hour, O King of Aztlan, did the Ocean Lord Through the great waters hither wend his way; For sure he is the friend of God and man. With that an uproar of assent arose From the whole people, a tumultuous shout Of universal joy and glad acclaim. But when Coanocotzin raised his hand, That he might speak, the clamour and the buz Ceased, and the multitude, in tiptoe hope, Attent and still, await the final voice. Then said the Sovereign, Hear, O Aztecas, Your own united will! From this day forth No life upon the altar shall be shed, No blood shall flow in sacrifice; the rites Shall all be pure, such as the blind Old Man, Whom God hath taught, will teach. This ye have will'd; And therefore it shall be! The King hath said! Like thunder the collected voice replied: Let it be so! Lord of the Ocean, then Pursued the King of Aztlan, we will now Lay the war-weapon in the grave, and join In right-hand friendship. By our custom, blood Should sanctify and bind the solemn act; But by what oath and ceremony thou Shalt proffer, by the same will Aztlan swear. Nor oath, nor ceremony, I replied, O King, is needful. To his own good word The good and honourable man will act, Oaths will not curb the wicked. Here we stand In the broad day-light; the For-Ever one, The Every-Where beholds us. In his sight We join our hands in peace: if e'er again Should these right hands be raised in enmity, Upon the offender will his judgement fall. The grave was dug; Coanocotzin laid His weapon in the earth; Erillyab's son, Young Amalahta, for the Hoamen, laid His hatchet there; and there I laid the sword. Here let me end. What follow'd was the work Of peace, no theme for story; how we fix'd Our sojourn in the hills, and sow'd our fields, And, day by day, saw all things prospering. Thence have I come, Goervyl, to announce The tidings of my happy enterprise; There I return, to take thee to our home. I love my native land; with as true love As ever yet did warm a British heart, Love I the green fields of the beautiful Isle, My father's heritage! But far away, Where nature's booner hand has blest the earth, My lot hath been assign'd; beyond the seas Madoc hath found his home; beyond the seas A country for his children hath he chosen, A land wherein their portion may be peace. IX. EMMA. But while Aberfraw echoed to the sounds Of merriment and music, Madoc's heart Mourn'd for his brethren. Therefore, when no ear Was nigh, he sought the King, and said to him, To-morrow, for Mathraval I set forth; Longer I must not linger here, to pass The easy hours in feast and revelry, Forgetful of my people far away. I go to tell the tidings of success, And seek new comrades. What if it should chance That, for this enterprise, our brethren, Foregoing all their hopes and fortunes here, Would join my banner? . . Let me send abroad Their summons, O my brother! so secure, You may forgive the past, and once again Will peace and concord bless our father's house. Hereafter will be time enow for this, The King replied; thy easy nature sees not, How, if the traitors for thy banner send Their bidding round, in open war against me Their own would soon be spread. I charge thee, Madoc, Neither to see nor aid these fugitives, The shame of Owen's blood. Sullen he spake, And turn'd away; nor farther commune now Did Madoc seek, nor had he more endured; For bitter thoughts were rising in his heart, And anguish, kindling anger. In such mood He to his sister's chamber took his way. She sate with Emma, with the gentle Queen; For Emma had already learnt to love The gentle maid. Goervyl saw what thoughts Troubled her brother's brow. Madoc, she cried, Thou hast been with the King, been rashly pleading For Ririd and for Rodri! . . He replied, I did but ask him little, . . did but say, Belike our brethren would go forth with me, To voluntary exile; then, methought, His fear and jealousy might well have ceased, And all be safe. And did the King refuse? Quoth Emma; I will plead for them, quoth she, With dutiful warmth and zeal will plead for them; And surely David will not say me nay. O sister! cried Goervyl, tempt him not! Sister, you know him not! Alas, to touch That perilous theme is, even in Madoc here, A perilous folly... Sister, tempt him not! You do not know the King! But then a fear Fled to the cheek of Emma, and her eye, Quickening with wonder, turn'd toward the Prince, As if expecting that his manly mind Would mould Goervyl's meaning to a shape Less fearful, would interpret and amend The words she hoped she did not hear aright. Emma was young; she was a sacrifice To that cold king-craft, which, in marriage-vows Linking two hearts, unknowing each of each, Perverts the ordinance of God, and makes The holiest tie a mockery and a curse. Her eye was patient, and she spake in tones So sweet and of so pensive gentleness, That the heart felt them. Madoc! she exclaimed, Why dost thou hate the Saxons? O my brother, If I have heard aright, the hour will come When the Plantagenet shall wish herself Among her nobler, happier countrymen, From these unnatural enmities escaped, And from the vengeance they must call from Heaven! Shame then suffused the Prince's countenance, Mindful how, drunk in anger, he had given His hatred loose. My sister Queen, quoth he, Marvel not you that with my mother's milk I suck'd that hatred in. Have they not been The scourge and the devouring sword of God, The curse and pestilence which he hath sent To root us from the land? Alas, our crimes Have drawn this dolorous visitation down! Our sun hath long been westering; and the night And darkness and extinction are at hand. We are a fallen people! . . From ourselves The desolation and the ruin come; In our own vitals doth the poison work.. The House that is divided in itself, How should it stand? . . A blessing on you, Lady! But in this wretched family the strife Is rooted all too deep; it is an old And cankered wound, . . an eating, killing sore, For which there is no healing... If the King Should ever speak his fears, . . and sure to you All his most inward thoughts he will make known, . . Counsel him then to let his brethren share My enterprise, to send them forth with me To everlasting exile... She hath told you Too hardly of the King; I know him well; He hath a stormy nature; and what germs Of virtue would have budded in his heart, Cold winds have check'd, and blighting seasons nipt, Yet in his heart they live... A blessing on you, That you may see their blossom and their fruit! X. MATHRAVAL. Now for Mathraval went Prince Madoc forth; O'er Menai's ebbing tide, up mountain-paths, Beside grey mountain-stream, and lonely lake, And through old Snowdon's forest-solitude, He held right on his solitary way. Nor paused he in that rocky vale, where oft Up the familiar path, with gladder pace, His steed had hastened to the well-known door, . . That valley, o'er whose crags, and sprinkled trees, And winding stream, so oft his eye had loved To linger, gazing, as the eve grew dim, From Dolwyddelan's Tower; . . alas! from thence As from his brother's monument, he turn'd A loathing eye, and through the rocky vale Sped on. From morn till noon, from noon till eve, He travelled on his way: and when at morn Again the Ocean Chief bestrode his steed, The heights of Snowdon on his backward glance Hung like a cloud in heaven. O'er heath and hill And barren height he rode; and darker now, In loftier majesty thy mountain-seat, Star-loving Idris, rose. Nor turn'd he now Beside Kregennan, where his infant feet Had trod Ednywain's hall; nor loitered he In the green vales of Powys, till he came Where Warnway rolls its waters underneath Ancient Mathraval's venerable walls, Cyveilioc's princely and paternal seat. But Madoc sprung not forward now to greet The chief he loved, for from Cyveilioc's hall The voice of harp and song commingled came; It was that day the feast of victory there; Around the Chieftain's board the warriors sate; The sword and shield and helmet, on the wall And round the pillars, were in peace hung up; And, as the flashes of the central fire At fits arose, a dance of wavy light Play'd o'er the reddening steel. The Chiefs, who late So well had wielded in the work of war Those weapons, sate around the board, to quaff The beverage of the brave, and hear their fame. Mathraval's Lord, the Poet and the Prince, Cyveilioc stood before them, . . in his pride; His hands were on the harp, his eyes were closed, His head, as if in reverence to receive The inspiration, bent; anon, he raised His glowing countenance and brighter eye, And swept with passionate hand the ringing harp. Fill high the Hirlas Horn! to Grufydd bear Its frothy beverage, . . from his crimson lance The invader fled; . . fill high the gold-tipt Horn! Heard ye in Maelor the step of war.. The hastening shout.. the onset? . . Did ye hear The clash and clang of arms.. the battle-din, Loud as the roar of Ocean, when the winds At midnight are abroad? . . the yell of wounds.. The rage.. the agony? . . Give to him the Horn Whose spear was broken, and whose buckler pierced With many a shaft, yet not the less he fought And conquered; . . therefore let Ednyved share The generous draught, give him the long blue Horn! Pour out again, and fill again the spoil Of the wild bull, with silver wrought of yore; And bear the golden lip to Tudyr's hand, Eagle of battle! For Moreiddig fill The honourable Hirlas! . . Where are They? Where are the noble Brethren? Wolves of war, They kept their border well, they did their part, Their fame is full, their lot is praise and song... A mournful song to me, a song of woe! . . Brave Brethren! for their honour brim the cup, Which they shall quaff no more. We drove away The strangers from our land; profuse of life, Our warriors rush'd to battle, and the Sun Saw from his noontide fields their manly strife. Pour thou the flowing mead! Cup-bearer, fill The Hirlas! for hadst thou beheld the day Of Llidom, thou hadst known how well the Chiefs Deserve this honour now. Cyveilioc's shield Were they in danger, when the Invader came; Be praise and liberty their lot on earth, And joy be theirs in heaven! Here ceased the song; Then from the threshold on the rush-strewn floor Madoc advanced. Cyveilioc's eye was now To present forms awake, but even as still He felt his harp-chords throb with dying sounds, The heat and stir and passion had not yet Subsided in his soul. Again he struck The loud-toned harp.... Pour from the silver vase, And brim the honourable Horn, and bear The draught of joy to Madoc, . . he who first Explored the desert ways of Ocean, first Through the wide waste of sea and sky, held on Undaunted, till upon another World, The Lord and Conqueror of the Elements, He set his foot triumphant? Fill for him The Hirlas! fill the honourable Horn! This for Mathraval is a happy hour, When Madoc, her hereditary guest, Appears within her honour'd walls again, Madoc, the British Prince, the Ocean Lord, Who, never for injustice rear'd his arm; Whose presence fills the heart of every foe With fear, the heart of every friend with joy; Give him the Hirlas Horn, fill, till the draught Of joy shall quiver o'er the golden brim! In happy hour the hero hath return'd! In happy hour the friend, the brother treads Cyveilioc's floor! He sprung to greet his guest; The cordial grasp of fellowship was given; So in Mathraval there was double joy On that illustrious day; they gave their guest The seat of honour, and they fill'd for him The Hirlas Horn. Cyveilioc and his Chiefs, All eagerly, with wonder-waiting eyes, Look to the Wanderer of the Water's tale. Nor mean the joy which kindled Madoc's brow, When as he told of daring enterprise Crown'd with deserved success. Intent they heard Of all the blessings of that happier clime; And when the adventurer spake of soon return, Each on the other gazed, as if to say, Methinks it were a goodly lot to dwell In that fair land in peace. Then said the Prince Of Powys, Madoc, at an happy time Thou hast toward Mathraval bent thy way; For on the morrow, in the eye of light, Our bards will hold their congress. Seekest thou Comrades to share success? proclaim abroad Thine invitation there, and it will spread Far as our fathers' ancient tongue is known. Thus at Mathraval went the Hirlas round; A happy day was that! Of other years They talk'd, of common toils, and fields of war Where they fought side by side; of Corwen's scene Of glory, and of comrades now no more: . . Themes of delight, and grief which brought its joy. Thus they beguiled the pleasant hours, while night Waned fast away; then late they laid them down, Each on his bed of rushes, stretch'd around The central fire. The Sun was newly risen When Madoc join'd his host, no longer now Clad as the conquering chief of Maelor, In princely arms, but in his nobler robe, The sky-blue mantle of the Bard, arrayed. So for the place of meeting they set forth; And now they reached Melangell's lonely church. Amid a grove of evergreens it stood, A garden and a grove, where every grave Was deck'd with flowers, or with unfading plants O'ergrown, sad rue, and funeral rosemary. Here Madoc paused. The morn is young, quoth he, A little while to old remembrance given Will not belate us... Many a year hath fled, Cyveilioc, since you led me here, and told The legend of the Saint. Come! . . be not loth! We will not loiter long... So soon to mount The bark, which will for ever bear me hence, I would not willingly pass by one spot Which thus recalls the thought of other times, Without a pilgrim's visit. Thus he spake, And drew Cyveilioc through the church-yard porch, To the rude image of Saint Monacel. Dost thou remember, Owen, said the Prince, When first I was thy guest in early youth, That once, as we had wandered here at eve, You told, how here a poor and hunted hare Ran to the Virgin's feet, and look'd to her For life? . . I thought, when listening to the tale, She had a merciful heart, and that her face Must with a saintly gentleness have beam'd, When beasts could read its virtue. Here we sate Upon the jutting root of this old yeugh... Dear friend! so pleasant didst thou make those days, That in my heart, long as my heart shall beat, Minutest recollections still will live, Still be the source of joy. As Madoc spake, His glancing eye fell on a monument, Around whose base the rosemary droop'd down, As yet not rooted well. Sculptured above, A warrior lay; the shield was on his arm; Madoc approach'd, and saw the blazonry, . . A sudden chill ran through him, as he read, Here Yorwerth lies... it was his brother's grave. Cyveilioc took him by the hand: For this, Madoc, was I so loth to enter here! He sought the sanctuary, but close upon him The murderers follow'd, and by yonder copse The stroke of death was given. All I could Was done; . . I saw him here consign'd to rest, Daily due masses for his soul are sung, And duly hath his grave been deck'd with flowers. So saying, from the place of death he led The silent Prince. But lately, he pursued, Llewelyn was my guest, thy favourite boy. For thy sake and his own, it was my hope That at Mathraval he would make his home; He had not needed then a father's love. But he, I know not on what enterprise, Was brooding ever; and those secret thoughts Drew him away. God prosper the brave boy! It were a happy day for this poor land If e'er Llewelyn mount his rightful throne. XI. THE GORSEDD. The place of meeting was a high hill-top, Nor bower'd with trees nor broken by the plough, Remote from human dwellings and the stir Of human life, and open to the breath And to the eye of Heaven. In days of old, There had the circling stones been planted; there, From earliest ages, the primeval lore, Through Bard to Bard with reverence handed down They whom to wonder, or the love of song, Or reverence of their fathers' ancient rites Drew thither, stood without the ring of stones. Cyveilioc entered to the initiate Bards, Himself, albeit his hands were stained with war, Initiate; for the Order, in the lapse Of years and in their nation's long decline From the first rigour of their purity Somewhat had fallen The Masters of the Song Were clad in azure robes, for in that hue Deduced from Heaven, which o'er a sinful world Spreads its eternal canopy serene, Meet emblem did the ancient Sages see Of unity and peace and spotless truth. Within the stones of Federation there, On the green turf, and under the blue sky, A noble band, the Bards of Britain stood, Their heads in reverence bare, and bare of foot. A deathless brotherhood! Cyveilioc there, Lord of the Hirlas; Llywarc there was seen. And old Cynddelow, to whose lofty song, So many a time amid his father's court Resigning up his soul, had Madoc given The flow of feeling loose. But Madoc's heart Was full; old feelings and remembrances, And thoughts from which was no escape, arose: He was not there to whose sweet lay, so oft, With all a brother's fond delight, he loved To listen, . . Hoel was not there! . . the hand That once so well, amid the triple chords, Moved in the rapid maze of harmony, It had no motion now; the lips were dumb Which knew all tones of passion; and that heart, That warm, ebullient heart, was cold and still, Upon its bed of clay. He look'd around, And there was no familiar countenance, None but Cynddelow's face, which he had learnt In childhood, and old age had set its mark, Making unsightly alteration there. Another generation had sprung up, And made him feel how fast the days of man Flow by, how soon their number is told out. He knew not then that Llywarc's lay should give His future fame; his spirit on the past Brooding, beheld with no forefeeling joy The rising sons of song, who there essay'd Their eaglet flight. But there among the youth In the green vesture of their earliest rank, Or with the aspirants clad in motley garb, Young Benvras stood; and, one whose favoured race Heaven with the hereditary power had blest, The old Gowalchmai's not degenerate child And there another Einion; gifted youths, And heirs of immortality on earth, Whose after-strains, through many a distant age Cambria shall boast, and love the songs that tell The fame of Owen's house. There, in the eye Of light and in the face of day, the rites Began. Upon the Stone of Covenant First, the sheathed sword was laid; the Master then Upraised his voice, and cried, Let them who seek The high degree and sacred privilege Of Bardic science, and of Cimbric lore, Here to the Bards of Britain make their claim! Thus having said, the Master bade the youths Approach the place of peace, and merit there The Bard's most honourable name: With that, Heirs and transmittors of the ancient light, The youths advanced; they heard the Cimbric lore, From earliest days preserved; they struck their harps, And each in due succession raised the song. Last of the aspirants, as of greener years, Young Caradoc advanced; his lip as yet Scarce darken'd with its down, his flaxen locks Wreathed in contracting ringlets waving low; Bright were his large blue eyes, and kindled now With that same passion that inflamed his cheek; Yet in his cheek there was the sickliness Which thought and feeling leave, wearing away The hue of youth. Inclining on his harp, He, while his comrades in probation song Approved their claim, stood hearkening, as it seem'd, And yet like unintelligible sounds He heard the symphony and voice attuned; Even in such feelings as, all undefined, Come with the flow of waters to the soul, Or with the motions of the moonlight sky. But when his bidding came, he at the call Arising from that dreamy mood, advanced, Threw back his mantle, and began the lay. Where are the sons of Gavran? where his tribe, The faithful? following their beloved Chief, They the Green Islands of the Ocean sought; Nor human tongue hath told, nor human ear, Since from the silver shores they went their way, Hath heard their fortunes. In his crystal Ark, Whither sail'd Merlin with his band of Bards, Old Merlin, master of the mystic lore? Belike his crystal Ark, instinct with life, Obedient to the mighty Master, reach'd The Land of the Departed; there, belike, They in the clime of immortality, Themselves immortal, drink the gales of bliss, Which o'er Flathinnis breathe eternal spring, Blending whatever odours make the gale Of evening sweet, whatever melody Charms the wood-traveller. In their high roof'd halls There, with the Chiefs of other days, feel they The mingled joy pervade them? . . Or beneath The mid-sea waters, did that crystal Ark Down to the secret depths of Ocean plunge Its fated crew? Dwell they in coral bowers With Mermaid loves, teaching their paramours The songs that stir the sea, or make the winds Hush, and the waves be still? In fields of joy Have they their home, where central fires maintain Perpetual summer, and an emerald light Pervades the green translucent element? Twice have the sons of Britain left her shores, As the fledged eaglets quit their native nest; Twice over ocean have her fearless sons For ever sail'd away. Again they launch Their vessels to the deep... Who mounts the bark? The son of Owen, the beloved Prince, Who never for injustice rear'd his arm. Respect his enterprize, ye Ocean Waves! Ye Winds of Heaven, waft Madoc on his way! The Waves of Ocean, and the Winds of Heaven, Became his ministers, and Madoc found The World he sought. Who seeks the better land? Who mounts the vessel for a world of peace? He who hath felt the throb of pride, to hear Our old illustrious annals; who was taught To lisp the fame of Arthur, to revere Great Caratach's unconquer'd soul, and call That gallant chief his countryman, who led The wrath of Britain from her chalky shores To drive the Roman robber. He who loves His country, and who feels his country's shame; Whose bones amid a land of servitude Could never rest in peace; who, if he saw His children slaves, would feel a pang in Heaven, . . He mounts the bark, to seek for liberty. Who seeks the better land? The wretched one Whose joys are blasted all, whose heart is sick, Who hath no hope, to whom all change is gain, To whom remember'd pleasures strike a pang That only guilt should know, . . he mounts the bark, The Bard will mount the bark of banishment; The harp of Cambria shall in other lands Remind the Cambrian of his fathers' fame; . . The Bard will seek the land of liberty, The World of peace... O Prince, receive the Bard! He ceased the song. His cheek, now fever-flush'd Was turn'd to Madoc, and his asking eye Linger'd on him in hope; nor linger'd long The look expectant; forward sprung the Prince, And gave to Caradoc the right-hand pledge, And for the comrade of his enterprize, With joyful welcome, hail'd the joyful Bard. Nor needed now the Searcher of the Sea Announce his enterprize, by Caradoc In song announced so well; from man to man The busy murmur spread, while from the Stone Of Covenant the sword was taken up, And from the Circle of the Ceremony The Bards went forth, their meeting now fulfill'd. The multitude, unheeding all beside, Of Madoc and his noble enterprize Held stirring converse on their homeward way, And spread abroad the tidings of a Land, Where Plenty dwelt with Liberty and Peace. XII. DINEVAWR. So in the court of Powys pleasantly, With hawk and hound afield, and harp in hall, The days went by; till Madoc, for his heart Was with Cadwallon, and in early spring Must he set forth to join him over-sea, Took his constrain'd farewell. To Dinevawr He bent his way, whence many a time with Rhys Had he gone forth to smite the Saxon foe. The Son of Owen greets his father's friend With reverential joy: nor did the Lord Of Dinevawr with cold or deaden'd heart Welcome the Prince he loved; though not with joy Unmingled now, nor the proud consciousness Which in the man of tried and approved worth Could bid an equal hail. Henry had seen The Lord of Dinevawr between his knees Vow homage; yea, the Lord of Dinevawr Had knelt in homage to that Saxon king, Who set a price upon his father's head, That Saxon, on whose soul his mother's blood Cried out for vengeance. Madoc saw the shame Which Rhys would fain have hidden, and, in grief For the degenerate land, rejoiced at heart That now another country was his home. Musing on thoughts like these, did Madoc roam Alone along the Towy's winding shore. The beavers in its bank had hollow'd out Their social place of dwelling, and had damm'd The summer-current, with their perfect art Of instinct, erring not in means nor end. But as the floods of spring had broken down Their barrier, so its breaches unrepair'd Were left; and round the piles, which, deeper driven, Still held their place, the eddying waters whirl'd. Now in those habitations desolate One sole survivor dwelt: him Madoc saw, Labouring alone, beside his hermit house; And in that mood of melancholy thought, . . For in his boyhood he had loved to watch Their social work, and for he knew that man In bloody sport had well-nigh rooted out The poor community, . . the ominous sight Became a grief and burthen. Eve came on; The dry leaves rustled to the wind, and fell And floated on the stream; there was no voice Save of the mournful rooks, who overhead Wing'd their long line; for fragrance of sweet flowers, Only the odour of the autumnal leaves; . . All sights and sounds of sadness... And the place To that despondent mood was ministrant; . . Among the hills of Gwyneth and its wilds And mountain glens, perforce he cherish'd still The hope of mountain liberty; they braced And knit the heart and arm of hardihood; . . But here, in these green meads, by these low slopes And hanging groves, attemper'd to the scene, His spirit yielded. As he loiter'd on, There came toward him one in peasant garb, And call'd his name; . . he started at the sound, For he had heeded not the man's approach; And now that sudden and familiar voice Came on him, like a vision. So he stood Gazing, and knew him not in the dim light, Till he again cried, Madoc! . . then he woke, And knew the voice of Ririd, and sprang on, And fell upon his neck, and wept for joy And sorrow. O my brother! Ririd cried, Long, very long it is since I have heard The voice of kindness! . . Let me go with thee! I am a wanderer in my father's land, . . Hoel he kill'd, and Yorwerth hath he slain; Llewelyn hath not where to hide his head In his own kingdom; Rodri is in chains; . . Let me go with thee, Madoc, to some land Where I may look upon the sun, nor dread The light that may betray me; where at night I may not, like a hunted beast, rouse up, If the leaves rustle over me. The Lord Of Ocean struggled with his swelling heart. Let me go with thee? . . but thou didst not doubt Thy brother? . . Let thee go? . . with what a joy, Ririd, would I collect the remnant left, . . The wretched remnant now of Owen's house, And mount the bark of willing banishment, And leave the tyrant to his Saxon friends, And to his Saxon yoke! . . I urged him thus, Curb'd down my angry spirit, and besought Only that I might bid our brethren come, And share my exile; . . and he spurn'd my prayer! . Thou hast a gentle pleader at his court; She may prevail; till then abide thou here; . . But not in this, the garb of fear and guilt. Come thou to Dinevawr, . . assume thyself; . . The good old Rhys will bid thee welcome there, And the great Palace, like a sanctuary, Is safe. If then Queen Emma's plea should fail, My timely bidding hence shall summon thee, When I shall spread the sail... Nay, hast thou learnt Suspicion? . . Rhys is noble, and no deed Of treachery ever sullied his fair fame! Madoc then led his brother to the hall Of Rhys. I bring to thee a supplicant, O King, he cried; thou wert my father's friend! And till our barks be ready in the spring, I know that here the persecuted son Of Owen will be safe. A welcome guest! The old warrior cried; by his good father's soul, He is a welcome guest at Dinevawr! And rising as he spake, he pledged his hand In hospitality... How now! quoth he, This raiment ill beseems the princely son Of Owen! . . Ririd at his words was led Apart; they wash'd his feet, they gave to him Fine linen, as beseem'd his royal race, The tunic of soft texture woven well, The broider'd girdle, the broad mantle edged With fur and flowing low, the bonnet last, Form'd of some forest martin's costly spoils. The Lord of Dinevawr sat at the dice With Madoc, when he saw him, thus array'd, Returning to the hall. Aye! this is well! The noble Chief exclaim'd; 'tis as of yore, When in Aberfraw, at his father's board, We sat together, after we had won Peace and rejoicing with our own right hands, By Corwen, where, commixt with Saxon blood, Along its rocky channel the dark Dee Roll'd darker waters... Would that all his house Had, in their day of trouble thought of me, And honour'd me like this! David respects Deheubarth's strength, nor would respect it less, When such protection leagued its cause with Heaven. I had forgot his messenger! quoth he, Arising from the dice. Go, bid him here! He came this morning at an ill-starr'd hour, To Madoc he pursued; my lazy grooms Had let the hounds play havoc in my flock, And my old blood was chafed. I'faith, the King Hath chosen well his messenger: . . he saw That in such mood, I might have render'd him A hot and hasty answer, and hath waited, Perhaps to David's service and to mine, My better leisure. Now the Messenger Enter'd the hall; Goagan of Powys-land, He of Caer-Einion was it, who was charged From Gwyneth to Deheubarth; a brave man Of copious speech. He told the royal son Of Gryffidd, the descendant of the line Of Rhys-ab-Tudyr mawr, that he came there From David, son of Owen, of the stock Of kingly Cynan. I am sent, said he, With friendly greeting; and as I receive Welcome and honour, so, in David's name, Am I to thank the Lord of Dinevawr. Tell on! quoth Rhys, the purport and the cause Of this appeal? Of late, some fugitives Came from the South to Mona, whom the King Received with generous welcome. Some there were Who blamed his royal goodness; for they said, These were the subjects of a rival Prince, Who, peradventure, would with no such bounty Cherish a northern suppliant. This they urged, I know not if from memory of old feuds, Better forgotten, or in envy. Moved Hereby, King David swore he would not rest Till he had put the question to the proof, Whether with liberal honour the Lord Rhys Would greet his messenger; but none was found Of all who had instill'd that evil doubt, Ready to bear the mebassy: I heard it, And did my person tender, . . for I knew The nature of Lord Rhys of Dinevawr. Well! quoth the Chief, Goagan of Powys-land, This honourable welcome that thou seekest Wherein may it consist? In giving me, Goagan of Powys-land replied, a horse Better than mine, to bear me home; a suit Of seemly raiment, and ten marks in coin, With raiment and two marks for him who leads My horse's bridle. For his sake, said Rhys, Who sent thee, thou shalt have the noblest steed In all my studs, . . I double thee the marks, And give the raiment threefold. More than this, . . Say thou to David, that the guests who sit At board with me, and drink of my own cup, Are Madoc and Lord Ririd. Tell the King, That thus it is Lord Rhys of Dinevawr Delighteth to do honour to the sons Of Owen, of his old and honour'd friend. XIII. LLEWELYN. Farewell, my brother, cried the Ocean Chief; A little while farewell! as through the gate Of Dinevawr he pass'd, to pass again That hospitable threshold never more. And thou too O thou good old man, true friend Of Owen, and of Owen's house, farewell! T will not be told me, Rhys, when thy grey hairs Are to the grave gone down; but oftentimes In the distant world I shall remember thee, And think that, come thy summons when it may, Thou will not leave a braver man behind.... Now God be with thee, Rhys! The old Chief paused A moment ere he answer'd, as for pain; Then shaking his hoar head, I never yet Gave thee this hand unwillingly before! When for a guest I spread the board, my heart Will think on him, whom ever with most joy It leapt to welcome: should I lift again The spear against the Saxon, . . for old Rhys Hath that within him yet, that could uplift The Cimbric spear, . . I then shall wish his aid, Who oft has conquer'd with me: when I kneel In prayer to Heaven, an old man's prayer shall beg A blessing on thee! Madoc answer'd not, But press'd his hand in silence, then sprang up And spurr'd his courser on. A weary way, Through forest and o'er fell, Prince Madoc rode; And now he skirts the bay whose reckless waves Roll o'er the plain of Gwaelod: fair fields And busy towns and happy villages, They overwhelm'd in one disastrous day; For they by their eternal siege had sapp'd The bulwark of the land, while Seithenyn Took of his charge no thought, till in his sloth And riotous cups surprised, he saw the waves Roll like an army o'er the levell'd mound. A supplicant in other courts, he mourn'd His crime and ruin; in another's court The kingly harp of Garanhir was heard, Wailing his kingdom wreck'd; and many a Prince, Warn'd by the visitation, sought and gain'd A saintly crown, Tyneio, Merini, Boda and Brenda and Aëlgyvarch, Gwynon and Celynin and Gwynodyl. To Bardsey was the Lord of Ocean bound; Bardsey, the holy Islet, in whose soil Did many a Chief and many a Saint repose, His great progenitors. He mounts the skiff; Her canvass swells before the breeze, the sea Sings round her sparkling keel, and soon the Lord Of Ocean treads the venerable shore There was not, on that day, a speck to stain The azure heaven; the blessed Sun alone In unapproachable divinity Career'd, rejoicing in his fields of light. How beautiful, beneath the bright blue sky The billows heave! one glowing green expanse, Save where along the bending line of shore Such hue is thrown, as when the peacock's neck Assumes its proudest tint of amethyst, Embathed in emerald glory. All the flocks Of Ocean are abroad: like floating foam, The sea-gulls rise and fall upon the waves; With long protruded neck the cormorants Wing their far flight aloft, and round and round The plovers wheel, and give their note of joy. It was a day that sent into the heart A summer feeling: even the insect swarms From their dark nooks and coverts issued forth, To sport through one day of existence more; The solitary primrose on the bank Seem'd now as though it had no cause to mourn Its bleak autumnal birth; the Rocks, and Shores, The Forest and the everlasting Hills, Smiled in that joyful sunshine, . . they partook The universal blessing. To this Isle, Where his forefathers were to dust consign'd, Did Madoc come for natural piety, Ordering a solemn service for their souls. Therefore for this the Church that day was drest: For this the Abbot, in his alb arrayed, At the high altar stood; for this infused, Sweet incense from the waving thuribule Rose like a mist, and the grey brotherhood Chaunted the solemn mass. And now on high The mighty Mystery had been elevate, And now around the graves the brethren In long array proceed: each in his hand, Tall as the staff of some wayfaring man, Bears the brown taper, with their daylight flames Dimming the cheerful day. Before the train The Cross is borne, where, fashion'd to the life In shape and size and ghastly colouring, The aweful Image hangs. Next, in its shrine Of gold and crystal, by the Abbot held, The mighty Mystery came; on either hand Three Monks uphold above, on silver wands, The purple pall. With holy water next A father went, therewith from hyssop branch Sprinkling the graves; the while, with one accord, The solemn psalm of mercy all entoned. Pure was the faith of Madoc, though his mind To all this pomp and solemn circumstance Yielded a willing homage. But the place Was holy; . . the dead air, which underneath Those arches never felt the healthy sun, Nor the free motion of the elements, Chilly and damp, infused associate awe: The sacred odours of the incense still Floated; the daylight and the taper-flames Commingled, dimming each, and each bedimm'd; And as the slow procession paced along, Still to their hymn, as if in symphony, The regular foot-fall sounded: swelling now, Their voices in one chorus, loud and deep, Rung through the echoing aisles; and when it ceased, The silence of that huge and sacred pile Came on the heart. What wonder if the Prince Yielded his homage there? the influences Of that sweet autumn day made every sense Alive to every impulse, . . and beneath The stones whereon he stood, his ancestors Were mouldering, dust to dust. Father! quoth he, When now the rites were ended, . . far away It hath been Madoc's lot to pitch his tent On other shores; there, in a foreign land, Far from my father's burial-place, must I Be laid to rest; yet would I have my name Be held with theirs in memory. I beseech you, Have this a yearly rite for evermore, As I will leave endowment for the same, And let me be remember'd in the prayer. The day shall be a holy day with me, While I do live; they who come after me, Will hold it holy; it will be a bond Of love and brotherhood, when all beside Hath been dissolved; and though wide ocean rolls Between my people and their mother Isle, This shall be their communion: They shall send, Link'd in one sacred feeling at one hour, In the same Janguage, the same prayer to Heaven, And each remembering each in piety, Pray for the other's welfare. The old man Partook that feeling, and some pious tears Fell down his aged cheek. Kinsman and son, It shall be so! said he; and thou shalt be Remember'd in the prayer: nor then alone; But till my sinking sands be quite run out, This feeble voice shall, from its solitude, Go up for thee to Heaven! And now the bell Rung out its cheerful summons; to the hall, In seemly order, pass the brotherhood: The serving-men wait with the ready ewer; The place of honour to the Prince is given, The Abbot's right-hand guest; the viands smoke, The horn of ale goes round: and now, the cates Removed, for days of festival reserved Comes choicer beverage, clary, hippocras, And mead mature, that to the goblet's brim Sparkles and sings and smiles. It was a day Of that allowable and temperate mirth Which leaves a joy for memory. Madoc told His tale; and thus, with question and reply And cheerful intercourse, from noon till nones The brethren sate; and when the quire was done, Renew'd their converse till the vesper bell. But then the Porter called Prince Madoc out, To speak with one, he said, who from the land Had sought him and required his private ear. Madoc in the moonlight met him: in his hand The stripling held an oar, and on his back, Like a broad shield, the coracle was hung. Uncle! he cried, and with a gush of tears, Sprung to the glad embrace. O my brave boy! Llewelyn! my dear boy! with stifled voice, And interrupted utterance, Madoc cried; And many times he claspt him to his breast, And many times drew back and gazed upon him, Wiping the tears away which dimm'd the sight, And told him how his heart had yearn'd for him, As with a father's love, and bade him now Forsake his lonely haunts and come with him, And sail beyond the seas and share his fate. No! by my God! the high-hearted youth replied, It never shall be said Llewelyn left His father's murderer on his father's throne! I am the rightful king of this poor land... Go thou, and wisely go; but I must stay, That I may save my people. Tell me, Uncle, The story of thy fortunes; I can hear it Here in this lonely Isle, and at this hour, Securely. Nay, quoth Madoc, tell me first Where are thy haunts and coverts, and what hope Thou hast to bear thee up? Why goest thou not To thy dear father's friend in Powys-land, There at Mathraval would Cyveiloc give A kinsman's welcome; or at Dinevawr, The guest of honour shouldst thou be with Rhys; And he belike from David might obtain Some recompence, though poor. What recompence? Exclaim'd Llewelyn; what hath he to give, But life for life? and what have I to claim But vengeance, and my father Yorwerth's throne? If with aught short of this my soul could rest, Would I not through the wide world follow thee, Dear Uncle! and fare with thee, well or ill, And show to thine old age the tenderness My childhood found from thee! . . What hopes I have Let time display. Have thou no fear for me! My bed is made within the ocean caves, Of sea-weeds, bleach'd by many a sun and shower; I know the mountain dens, and every hold And fastness of the forest; and I know, . . . What troubles him by day and in his dreams, . . . There's many an honest heart in Gwyneth yet! But tell me thine adventure; that will be A joy to think of in long winter nights, When stormy billows make my lullaby. So as they walk'd along the moonlight shore, Did Madoc tell him all; and still he strove, By dwelling on that noble end and aim, That of his actions was the heart and life, To win him to his wish. It touch'd the youth; And when the Prince had ceased, he heaved a sigh, Long-drawn and deep, as if regret were there. No, no! he cried, it must not be! lo yonder My native mountains, and how beautiful They rest in the moonlight! I was nurst among them; They saw my sports in childhood, they have seen My sorrows, they have saved me in the hour Of danger; . . I have vowed, that as they were My cradle, they shall be my monument! . . But we shall meet again, and thou wilt find me, When next thou visitest thy native Isle, King in Aberfraw! Never more, Llewelyn, Madoc replied, shall I behold the shores Of Britain, nor will ever tale of me Reach the Green Isle again. With fearful care I chuse my little company, and leave No traces of our path, where Violence, And bloody Zeal, and bloodier Avarice Might find their blasting way. If it be so, . . And wise is thy resolve, the youth replied, Thou wilt not know my fate; . . but this be sure, It shall not be inglorious. I have in me Ahope from Heaven... Give me thy blessing, Uncle! Llewelyn, kneeling on the sand, embraced His knees, with lifted head and streaming eyes Listening. He rose, and fell on Madoc's neck, And clasp'd him, with a silent agony, . . Then launch'd his coracle, and took his way, A lonely traveller on the moonlight sea. XIV. LLAIAN. Now hath Prince Madoc left the holy Isle, And homeward to Aberfraw, through the wilds Of Arvon, bent his course. A little way He turn'd aside, by natural impulses Moved, to behold Cadwallon's lonely hut. That lonely dwelling stood among the hills, By a grey mountain-stream; just elevate Above the winter torrents did it stand, Upon a craggy bank; an orchard slope Arose behind, and joyous was the scene In early summer, when those antic trees Shone with their blushing blossoms, and the flax Twinkled beneath the breeze its liveliest green. But save the flax-field and that orchard slope, All else was desolate, and now it wore One sober hue; the narrow vale which wound Among the hills, was grey with rocks, that peer'd Above its shallow soil; the mountain side Was loose with stones bestrewn, which oftentimes Clattered adown the steep, beneath the foot Of straggling goat dislodged; or tower'd with crags, One day when winter's work hath loosen'd them, To thunder down. All things assorted well With that grey mountain hue; the low stone lines, Which scarcely seem'd to be the work of man, The dwelling rudely rear'd with stones unhewn, The stubble flax, the crooked apple-trees Grey with their fleecy moss and misseltoe, The white-bark'd birch now leafless, and the ash Whose knotted roots were like the rifted rock, Through which they forced their way. Adown the vale, Broken by stones and o'er a stoney bed, Roll'd the loud mountain-stream. When Madoc came, A little child was sporting by the brook, Floating the fallen leaves, that he might see them Whirl in the eddy now and now be driven Down the descent, now on the smoother stream Sail onward far away. But when he heard The horse's tramp, he raised his head and watch'd The Prince, who now dismounted and drew nigh. The little boy still fix'd his eyes on him, His bright blue eyes; the wind just moved the curls That cluster'd round his brow; and so he stood, His rosy cheeks still lifted up to gaze In innocent wonder. Madoc took his hand, And now had ask'd his name, and if he dwelt There in the hut, when from that cottage-door A woman came, who seeing Madoc stopt With such a fear, . . for she had cause for fear, As when a bird returning to her nest, Turns to a tree beside, if she behold Some prying boy too near the dear retreat. Howbeit advancing soon she now approach'd The approaching Prince, and timidly enquired, If on his wayfare he had lost the track, That thither he had strayed. Not so, replied The gentle Prince; but having known this place, And its old habitants, I came once more To see the lonely hut among the hills. Hath it been long your dwelling? Some few years, Here we have dwelt, quoth she, my child and I. Will it please you enter, and partake such fare As we can give? Still timidly she spake, But gathering courage from the gentle mien Of him with whom she conversed. Madoc thank'd Her friendly proffer, and toward the hut They went, and in his arms he took the boy. Who is his father? said the Prince, but wish'd The word unutter'd; for thereat her cheek Was flush'd with sudden heat and manifest pain; And she replied, He perish'd in the war. They enter'd now her home; she spread the board, And set before her guest soft curds, and cheese Of curd-like whiteness, with no foreign die Adulterate, and what fruits the orchard gave, And that old British beverage which the bees Had toil'd to purvey all the summer long. Three years, said Madoc, have gone by, since here I found a timely welcome, overworn With toiland sorrow and sickness: . . three long years! 'Twas when the battle had been waged hard by, Upon the plain of Arvon. She grew pale, Suddenly pale; and seeing that he mark'd The change, she told him, with a feeble voice, That was the fatal fight which widow'd her. O Christ, cried Madoc, 'tis a grief to think How many a gallant Briton died that day, In that accursed strife! I trod the field When all was over, . . I beheld them heap'd... Aye like ripe corn within the reaper's reach, Strewn round the bloody spot where Hoel lay; Brave as he was, himself cut down at last, Oppress'd by numbers, gash'd with wounds, yet still Clenching in his dead hand the broken sword! . . But you are moved, . . you weep at what I tell. Forgive me, that renewing my own grief, I should have waken'd yours! Did you then know Prince Hoel? She replied, Oh no! my lot Was humble, and my loss a humble one; Yet was it all to me! They say, quoth she, . . . And, as she spake, she struggled to bring forth With painful voice the interrupted words, . . . They say Prince Hoel's body was not found; But you who saw him dead perchance can tell Where he was laid, and by what friendly hand. Even where he fell, said Madoc, is his grave; For he who buried him was one whose faith Reck'd not of boughten prayers, nor passing bell. There is a hawthorn grows beside the place, A solitary tree, nipt by the winds, That it doth seem a fitting monument For one untimely slain... But wherefore dwell we On this ungrateful theme? He took a harp Which stood beside, and passing o'er its chords Made music. At the touch the child drew nigh, Pleased by the sound, and leant on Madoc's knee, And bade him play again: So Madoc play'd, For he had skill in minstrelsy, and raised His voice, and sung Prince Hoel's lay of love. I have harness'd thee, my Steed of shining grey, And thou shalt bear me to the dear white walls. I love the white walls by the verdant bank, That glitter in the sun, where Bashfulness Watches the silver sea-mew sail along. I love that glittering dwelling, where we hear The ever-sounding billows; for there dwells The shapely Maiden, fair as the sea-spray, Her cheek as lovely as the apple flower, Or summer evening's glow. I pine for her; In crowded halls my spirit is with her; Through the long sleepless night I think on her; And happiness is gone, and health is lost, And fled the flush of youth, and I am pale As the pale ocean on a sunless morn. I pine away for her, yet pity her, That she should spurn so true a love as mine. He ceased, and laid his hand upon the child, . . . And didst thou like the song? The child replied, . . Oh yes! it is a song my mother loves, And so I love it too. He stoopt and kiss'd The boy, who still was leaning on his knee, Already grown familiar. I should like To take thee with me, quoth the Ocean Lord, Over the seas. Thou art Prince Madoc, then! . . . The mother cried, . . . thou art indeed the Prince! That song... that look... and at his feet she fell, Crying... Oh take him, Madoc! save the child! Thy brother Hoel's orphan! Long it was Ere that in either agitated heart The tumult could subside. One while the Prince Gazed on the child, tracing intently there His brother's lines; and now he caught him up, And kiss'd his cheek, and gazed again till all Was dim and dizzy, . . then blest God, and vow'd That he should never need a father's love. At length when copious tears had now relieved Her burthen'd heart, and many a broken speech In tears had died away, O Prince, she cried, Long hath it been my dearest prayer to heaven, That I might see thee once, and to thy love Commit this friendless boy! For many a time, In phrase so fond did Hoel tell thy worth, That it hath waken'd misery in me To think I could not as a sister claim Thy love! and therefore was it that till now Thou knew'st me not; for I entreated him That he would never let thy virtuous eye Look on my guilt, and make me feel my shame. Madoc, I did not dare to see thee then, Thou wilt not scorn me now, . . for I have now Forgiven myself; and, while I here perform'd A mother's duty in this solitude, Have felt myself forgiven. With that she clasp'd His hand, and bent her face on it and wept. Anon collecting she pursued, . . My name Is Llaian: by the chance of war I fell Into his power, when all my family Had been cut off, all in one hour of blood. He saved me from the ruffian's hand, he sooth'd With tenderest care my sorrow... You can tell How gentle he could be, and how his eyes, So full of life and kindliness, could win All hearts to love him. Madoc, I was young; I had no living friend; . . and when I gave This infant to his arms, when with such joy He view'd it o'er and o'er again, and press'd A father's kiss upon its cheek, and turn'd To me, and made me feel more deeply yet A mother's deep delight, . . oh! I was proud To think my child in after years should say, Prince Hoel was his father! Thus I dwelt In the white dwelling by the verdant bank, . . Though not without my melancholy hours, Happy. The joy it was when I beheld His steed of shining grey come hastening on, Across the yellow sand! . . Alas, ere long, King Owen died. I need not tell thee, Madoc, With what a deadly and forefeeling fear I heard how Hoel seized his father's throne, Nor with what ominous woe I welcomed him, In that last little miserable hour Ambition gave to love. I think his heart, Brave as it was, misgave him. When I spake Of David and my fears, he smiled upon me; But 'twas a smile that came not from the heart, . . A most ill-boding smile! . . O Madoc! Madoc! You know not with what misery I saw His parting steps, . . with what a dreadful hope I watch'd for tidings! . . And at length it came, . . Came like a thunderbolt! . . I sought the field! O Madoc, there were many widows there, But none with grief like mine! I look'd around; I dragg'd aside the bodies of the dead, To search for him, in vain; . . and then a hope Seized me, which it was agony to lose! Night came. I did not heed the storm of night; But for the sake of this dear babe, I sought Shelter in this lone hut: 'twas desolate; And when my reason had return'd, I thought That here the child of Hoel might be safe, Till we could claim thy care. But thou, meantime, Didst go to roam the Ocean; so I learnt To bound my wishes here. The carkanet, The embroider'd girdle, and what other gauds Were once my vain adornments, soon were changed For things of profit, goats and bees, and this, The tuneful solace of my solitude. Madoc, the harp is as a friend to me; I sing to it the songs which Hoel loved, And Hoel's own sweet lays; it comforts me, And gives me joy in grief. Often I grieved, To think the son of Hoel should grow up In this unworthy state of poverty; Till Time, who softens all regrets, had worn That vain regret away, and I became Humbly resign'd to God's unerring will. To him I look'd for healing, and he pour'd His balm into my wounds. I never form'd A prayer for more, . . and lo! the happiness Which he hath, of his mercy, sent me now! XV. THE EXCOMMUNICATION. On Madoc's docile courser Llaian sits, Holding her joyful boy; the Prince beside Paces afoot, and like a gentle Squire Leads her loose bridle; from the saddle-bow His shield and helmet hang, and with the lance, Staff-like, he stay'd his steps. Before the sun Had climb'd his southern eminence, they left The mountain-feet; and hard by Bangor now, Travelling the plain before them they espy A lordly cavalcade, for so it seem'd, Of knights, with hawk in hand and hounds in leash, Squires, pages, serving-men, and armed grooms, And many a sumpter-beast and laden wain, Far following in their rear. The bravery Of glittering bauldricks and of high-plumed crests, Embroider'd surcoats and emblazon'd shields, And lances whose long streamers play'd aloft, Made a rare pageant, as with sound of trump, Tambour and cittern, proudly they went on; And ever, at the foot-fall of their steeds, The tinkling horse-bells, in rude symphony, Accorded with the joy. What have we here? Quoth Madoc then to one who stood beside The threshold of his osier-woven hut. 'Tis the great Saxon Prelate, he return'd, Come hither for some end, I wis not what, Only be sure no good! . . How stands the tide? Said Madoc; can we pass? . . 'Tis even at flood, The man made answer, and the Monastery Will have no hospitality to spare For one of Wales to-day. Be ye content To guest with us. He took the Prince's sword: The daughter of the house brought water then, And wash'd the stranger's feet; the board was spread, And o'er the bowl they commun'd of the days Ere ever Saxon set his hateful foot Upon the beautiful Isle. As so they sate, The bells of the Cathedral rung abroad Unusual summons. What is this? exclaim'd Prince Madoc; let us see! . . Forthwith they went, He and his host, their way. They found the rites Begun; the mitred Baldwin, in his hand Holding a taper, at the altar stood. Let him be cursed! . . were the words which first Assail'd their ears, . . living and dead, in limb And life, in soul and body, be he curst Here and hereafter! Let him feel the curse At every moment, and in every act, By night and day, in waking and in sleep! We cut him off from Christian fellowship; Of Christian sacraments we deprive his soul; Of Christian burial we deprive his corpse; And when that carrion to the Fiends is left In unprotected earth, thus let his soul Be quench'd in hell! He dash'd upon the floor His taper down, and all the ministring Priests Extinguish'd each his light, to consummate The imprecation. Whom is it ye curse Cried Madoc, with these horrors? They replied, The contumacious Prince of Powys-land, Cyveilioc. What! quoth Madoc, and his eye Grew terrible, . . . Who is he that sets his foot In Gwyneth, and with hellish forms like these Dare outrage here Mathraval's noble Lord? We wage no war with women nor with Priests; But if there be a knight amid your train, Who will stand forth, and speak before my face Dishonour of the Prince of Powys-land, Lo! here stand I, Prince Madoc, who will make That slanderous wretch cry craven in the dust, And eat his lying words! Be temperate! Quoth one of Baldwin's Priests, who, Briton born, Had known Prince Madoc in his father's court; It is our charge, throughout this Christian land, To call upon all Christian men to join The armies of the Lord, and take the cross; That so, in battle with the Infidels, The palm of victory or of martyrdom, Glorious alike, may be their recompense. This holy badge, whether in godless scorn, Or for the natural blindness of his heart, Cyveilioc hath refused; thereby incurring The pain, which, not of our own impulse, we Inflict upon his soul, but at the will Of our most holy Father, from whose word Lies no appeal on earth. 'Tis well for thee, Intemperate Prince! said Baldwin, that our blood Flows with a calmer action than thine own! Thy brother David hath put on the cross, To our most pious warfare piously Pledging his kingly sword. Do thou the like, And for this better object lay aside Thine other enterprize, which, lest it rob Judea of one single Christian arm, We do condemn as sinful. Follow thou The banner of the church to Palestine; So shalt thou expiate this rash offence, Against the which we else should fulminate Our ire, did we not see in charity, And therefore rather pity than resent, The rudeness of this barbarous land. At that, Scorn tempering wrath, yet anger sharpening scorn, Madoc replied, Barbarians as we are, Lord Prelate, we received the law of Christ Many a long age before your pirate sires Had left their forest dens: nor are we now To learn that law from Norman or from Dane, Saxon, Jute, Angle, or whatever name Suit best your mongrel race! Ye think, perchance, That like your own poor woman-hearted King, We too in Gwyneth are to take the yoke Of Rome upon our necks; . . but you may tell Your Pope, that when I sail upon the seas, I shall not strike a topsail for the breath Of all his maledictions! Saying thus, He turn'd away, lest farther speech might call Farther reply, and kindle farther wrath, More easy to avoid than to allay. Therefore he left the church; and soon his mind To gentler mood was won, by social talk And the sweet prattle of that blue-eyed boy, Whom in his arms he fondled. But when now Evening had settled, to the door there came One of the brethren of the Monastery, Who called Prince Madoc forth. Apart they went, And in the low suspicious voice of fear, Though none was nigh, the Monk began. Be calm, Prince Madoc, while I speak, and patiently Hear to the end! Thou know'st that, in his life, Becket did excommunicate thy sire For his unlawful marriage; but the King, Feeling no sin in conscience, heeded not The inefficient censure. Now when Baldwin Beheld his monument to-day, impell'd, As we do think, by anger against thee, He swore that, even as Owen in his deeds Disown'd the Church when living, even so The Church disown'd him dead, and that his corpse No longer should be suffer'd to pollute The Sanctuary... Be patient, I beseech, And hear me out. Gerald at this, who felt A natural horror, sought, . . as best he knew The haughty Primate's temper, . . to dissuade By politic argument, and chiefly urged The quick and fiery nature of our nation, . . How at the sight of such indignity, They would arise in arms, and limb from limb Tear piecemeal him and all his company. So far did this prevail, that he will now Commit the deed in secret; and, this night, Thy father's body from its resting-place, O Madoc! shall be torn, and cast aside In some unhallow'd pit, with foul disgrace And contumelious wrong. Sayest thou to-night? Quoth Madoc... Aye, at midnight, he replied, Shall this impiety be perpetrated. Therefore hath Gerald, for the reverence He bears to Owen's royal memory, Sent thee the tidings. Now be temperate In thy just anger, Prince! and shed no blood. Thou know'st how dearly the Plantagenet Atones for Becket's death; and be thou sure, Though thou thyself shouldst sail beyond the storm, That it would fall on Britain. While he spake, Madoc was still; the feeling work'd too deep For speech, or visible sign. At length he said, What if amid their midnight sacrilege I should appear among them? It were well; The Monk replied, if, at a sight like that, Thou canst withhold thy hand. Oh, fear me not! Good and true friend, said Madoc. I am calm, And calm as thou beholdest me will prove In word and action. Quick I am to feel Light ills, . . perhaps o'er-hasty: summer gnats, Finding my cheek unguarded, may infix Their skin-deep stings, to vex and irritate; But if the wolf, or forest board, be nigh, I am awake to danger. Even so Bear I a mind of steel and adamant Against all greater wrongs. My heart hath now Received its impulse; and thou shalt behold How in this strange and hideous circumstance I shall find profit.... Only, my true friend, Let me have entrance. At the western porch, Between the complines and the matin-bell, . . The Monk made answer: thou shalt find the door Ready. Thy single person will suffice; For Baldwin knows his danger, and the hour Of guilt or fear convicts him, both alike Opprobrious. Now, farewell! Then Madoc took His host aside, and in his private ear Told him the purport, and wherein his help Was needed. Night came on; the hearth was heapt, The women went to rest. They twain, the while, Sate at the board, and while the untasted bowl Stood by them, watch'd the glass whose falling sands Told out the weary hours. The hour is come; Prince Madoc helm'd his head, and from his neck He slung the bugle-horn; they took their shields, And lance in hand went forth. And now arrived, The bolts give back before them, and the door Rolls on its heavy hinge. Beside the grave Stood Baldwin and the Prior, who, albeit Cambrian himself, in fear and awe obey'd The lordly Primate's will. They stood and watch'd Their ministers perform the irreverent work. And now with spade and mattock have they broken Into the house of death, and now have they From the stone coffin wrench'd the iron cramps, When sudden interruption startled them, And clad in complete mail from head to foot, They saw the Prince come in. Their tapers gleam'd Upon his visage, as he wore his helm Open; and when in that pale countenance, . . For the strong feeling blanch'd his cheek, . . they saw His father's living lineaments, a fear Like ague shook them. But anon that fit Of scared imagination to the sense Of other peril yielded, when they heard Prince Madoc's dreadful voice. Stay! he exclaim'd, As now they would have fled; . . stir not a man, . . Or if I once put breath into this horn, All Wales will hear, as if dead Owen call'd For vengeance from that grave. Stir not a man, Or not a man shall live! The doors are watch'd, And ye are at my mercy! But at that, Baldwin from the altar seized the crucifix, And held it forth to Madoc, and cried out, He who strikes me, strikes Him; forbear, on pain Of endless— Peace! quoth Madoc, and profane not The holy Cross, with those polluted hands Of midnight sacrilege! . . Peace! I harm thee not, . . Be wise, and thou art safe... For thee, thou know'st, Prior, that if thy treason were divulged, David would hang thee on thy steeple top, To feed the steeple daws: Obey and live! Go, bring fine linen and a coffer meet To bear these relics; and do ye, meanwhile, Proceed upon your work. They at his word Raised the stone cover, and display'd the dead, In royal grave-clothes habited, his arms Cross'd on the breast, with precious gums and spice Fragrant, and incorruptibly preserved. At Madoc's bidding, round the corpse they wrap The linen web, fold within fold involved; They laid it in the coffer, and with cloth At head and foot filled every interval And prest it down compact; they closed the lid, And Madoc with his signet seal'd it thrice. Then said he to his host, Bear thou at dawn This treasure to the ships. My father's bones Shall have their resting-place, where mine one day May moulder by their side. He shall be free In death, who living did so well maintain His and his country's freedom. As for ye, For your own safety, ye I ween will keep My secret safe. So saying, he went his way. XVI. DAVID. Now hath the Lord of Ocean once again Set foot in Mona. Llaian there receives Sisterly greeting from the royal maid, Who, while she tempers to the public eye Her welcome, safely to the boy indulged In fond endearments of instinctive love. When the first flow of joy was overpast, How went the equipment on, the Prince enquired. Nay, brother, quoth Goervyl, ask thou that Of Urien; . . it hath been his sole employ Daily from cock-crow until even-song, That he hath laid aside all other thoughts, Forgetful even of me! She said and smiled Playful reproach upon the good old man, Who in such chiding as affection loves, Dallying with terms of wrong, return'd rebuke. There, Madoc, pointing to the shore, he cried, There are they moor'd; six gallant barks, as trim And worthy of the sea as ever yet Gave canvass to the gale. The mariners Flock to thy banner, and the call hath roused Many a brave spirit. Soon as Spring shall serve, There need be no delay. I should depart Without one wish that lingers, could we bear Ririd from hence, and break poor Rodri's chains, Thy lion-hearted brother; . . and that boy, If he were with us, Madoc! that dear boy Llewelyn! Sister, said the Prince at that, How sped the Queen? Oh, Madoc! she replied, A hard and unrelenting heart hath he. The gentle Emma told me she had fail'd, And that was all she told; but in her eye I could see sorrow struggling. She complains not, And yet, I know, in bitterness laments The hour which brought her as a victim here. Then I will seek the Monarch, Madoc cried; And forth he went. Cold welcome David gave, Such as might chill a suppliant; but the Prince Fearless began. I found at Dinevawr Our brother Ririd, and he made his suit That he might follow me, a banish'd man. He waits thine answer at the court of Rhys. Now I beseech thee, David, say to him His father's hall is open! Then the King Replied, I told thee, Madoc, thy request Displeased me heretofore; I warn'd thee, too, To shun the rebel; yet my messenger Tells me, the guests at Dinevawr who sate At board with Rhys and drank of his own cup Were Madoc and Lord Ririd... Was this well, This open disobedience to my will, And my express command? Madoc subdued His rising wrath. If I should tell thee, Sire, He answered, by what chance it so fell out, I should of disobedience stand excused, Even were it here a crime. Yet think again, David, and let thy better mind prevail! I am his surety here; he comes alone; The strength of yonder armament is mine; And when did I deceive thee? . . I did hope, For natural love and public decency, That ye would part in friendship... let that pass! He may remain, and join me in the hour Of embarkation. But for thine own sake, Cast off these vile suspicions, and the fear That makes its danger! Call to mind, my brother, The rampart that we were to Owen's throne! Are there no moments when the thoughts and loves Of other days return? . . Let Rodri loose! Restore him to his birth-right! . . Why wouldst thou Hold him in chains, when benefits would bind His noble spirit? Leave me! cried the King; Thou know'st the theme is hateful to my ear. I have the mastery now, and idle words, Madoc, shall never thrust me from the throne, Which this right arm in battle hardly won. There must he lie till nature set him free, And so deliver both. Trespass no more! A little yet bear with me, Madoc cried. I leave this land for ever; let me first Behold my brother Rodri, lest he think My summer love be withered, and in wrath Remember me hereafter. Leave me, Madoc! Speedily, ere indulgence grow a fault, Exclaim'd the Monarch. Do not tempt my wrath; Thou know'st me! Aye! the Ocean Prince replied, I know thee, David, and I pity thee, Thou poor, suspicious, miserable man! Friend hast thou none, except thy country's foe, That hateful Saxon, he whose bloody hand Pluck'd out thy brethren's eyes; and for thy kin, Them hast thou made thy perilous enemies. What if the Lion Rodri were abroad? What if Llewelyn's banner were display'd? The sword of England could not save thee then. Frown not, and menace not! for what am I, That I should fear thine anger? . . And with that He turn'd indignant from the wrathful king. XVII. THE DEPARTURE. Winter hath pass'd away; the vernal storms Have spent their rage, the ships are stored, and now To-morrow they depart. That day a Boy, Weary and foot-sore, to Aberfraw came, Who to Goervyl's chamber made his way, And caught the hem of her garment, and exclaim'd, A boon, . . a boon, . . dear Lady! Nor did he Wait more reply than that encouragement, Which her sweet eye and lovely smile bestow'd; I am a poor, unhappy, orphan boy, Born to fair promises and better hopes, But now forlorn. Take me to be your page! . . For blessed Mary's sake, refuse me not! I have no friend on earth, nor hope but this. The boy was fair; and though his eyes were swoln, And cheek defiled with tears, and though his voice Came choak'd by grief, yet to that earnest eye And supplicating voice so musical, It had not sure been easy to refuse The boon he begg'd. I cannot grant thy suit, Goervyl cried, but I can aid it, boy! . . Go ask of Madoc! . . And herself arose, And led him where her brother on the shore That day the last embarkment oversaw. Mervyn then took his mantle by the skirt, And knelt and made his suit; she too began To sue, but Madoc smiling on the Maid, Won by the virtue of the countenance Which look'd for favour, lightly gave the yes. Where wert thou, Caradoc, when that fair boy Told his false tale? for hadst thou heard the voice, The gentle voice so musically sweet, And seen that earnest eye, it would have heal'd Thy wounded heart, and thou hadst voyaged on The happiest man that ever yet forsook His native country! He, on board the bark, Leant o'er the vessel-side, and there he stood And gazed, almost unconscious that he gazed, Toward yon distant mountains where she dwelt, Senena, his beloved. Caradoc, Senena, thy beloved, is at hand! Her golden locks are clipt, and her blue eye Is wandering through the throng in search of thee, For whose dear sake she hath forsaken all. You deem her false, that her frail constancy Shrunk from her father's anger, that she lives Another's victim bride; but she hath fled From that unnatural anger; hath escaped The unnatural union; she is on the shore, Senena, blue-eyed Maid, a seemly boy, To share thy fortunes, to reward thy love, And to the land of peace to follow thee, Over the ocean waves. Now all is done. Stores, beeves and flocks and water all aboard; The dry East blows, and not a sign of change Stains the clear firmament. The Sea-Lord sate At the last banquet in his brother's court, And heard the song: It told of Owen's fame, When with his Normen and assembled force Of Guienne and Gascony, and Anjou's strength, The Fleming's aid and England's chosen troops, Along the ascent of Berwyn, many a day The Saxon vainly on his mountain foes Denounced his wrath; for Mona's dragon sons, By wary patience baffled long his force, Winning slow Famine to their aid, and help'd By the angry Elements, and Sickness sent From Heaven, and Fear that of its vigour robb'd The healthy arm; . . then in quick enterprize Fell on his weary and dishearten'd host, Till with defeat and loss and obloquy He fled with all his nations. Madoc gave His spirit to the song; he felt the theme In every pulse; the recollection came, Revived and heighten'd to intenser pain, That in Aberfraw, in his father's hall, He never more should share the feast, nor hear The echoing harp again! His heart was full; And, yielding to its yearnings, in that mood Of aweful feeling, he call'd forth the King, And led him from the palace-porch, and stretch'd His hand toward the ocean, and exclaim'd, To-morrow over yon wide waves I go; To-morrow, never to return, I leave My native land! O David, O my brother, Turn not impatiently a reckless ear To that affectionate and natural voice Which thou wilthear no more! Release our brethren, Recall the wanderers home, and link them to thee By cordial confidence, by benefits Which bless the benefactor. Be not thou As is the black and melancholy yew That strikes into the grave its baleful roots, And prospers on the dead! . . The Saxon King, . . Think not I wrong him now; . . an hour like this Hath soften'd all my harsher feelings down; Nor will I hate him for his sister's sake, Thy gentle Queen, . . whom, that great God may bless, And, blessing her, bless thee and our dear country, Shall never be forgotten in my prayers; But he is far away; and should there come The evil hour upon thee, . . if thy kin, Wearied by suffering, and driven desperate, Should lift the sword, or young Llewelyn raise His banner and demand his father's throne, . . Were it not trusting to a broken reed, To lean on England's aid? . . I urge thee not For answer now; but sometimes, O my brother! Sometimes recall to mind my parting words, As 'twere the death-bed counsel of the friend Who loved thee best! The affection of his voice, So mild and solemn, soften'd David's heart, He saw his brother's eyes, suffused with tears, Shine in the moon-beam as he spake; the King Remembered his departure, and he felt Feelings, which long from his disnatured breast Ambition had expell'd: he could almost Have follow'd their strong impulse. From the shore, Madoc with quick and agitated step Had sought his home; the monarch went his way, Serious and slow, and laid him down that night With painful recollections, and such thoughts, As might, if Heaven had will'd it, have matured To penitence and peace The day is come, The adventurers in Saint Cybi's holy fane Hear the last mass, and all assoil'd of sin Partake the bread of Christian fellowship. Then, as the Priest his benediction gave, They knelt, in such an aweful stillness hush'd, As with yet more oppression seem'd to load The burthen'd heart. At times and half supprest, Womanly sobs were heard, and manly cheeks Were wet with silent tears. Now forth they go, And at the portal of the Church unfurl Prince Madoc's banner; at that sight a shout Burst from his followers, and the hills and rocks Thrice echoed their acclaim. There lie the ships, Their sails all loose, their streamers rolling out With sinuous flow and swell, like water-snakes, Curling aloft; the waves are gay with boats, Pinnace and barge and coracle, . . the sea Swarms like the shore with life. Oh what a sight Of beauty for the spirit unconcern'd, If heart there be which unconcern'd could view A sight like this! . . how yet more beautiful For him, whose soul can feel and understand The solemn import! Yonder they embark, Youth, beauty, valour, virtue, reverend age; Some led by love of noble enterprise, Others, who, desperate of their country's weal, Fly from the impending yoke; all warm alike With confidence and high heroic hope, And all in one fraternal bond conjoin'd By reverence to their Chief, the best beloved That ever yet on hopeful enterprize Led gallant army forth. He, even now Lord of himself, by faith in God and love To man subdues the feeling of this hour, The bitterest of his being. At this time, Pale, and with feverish eye, the King came up, And led him somewhat from the throng apart, Saying, I sent at day-break to release Rodri from prison, meaning that with thee He should depart in peace; but he was gone, This very night he had escaped! . . Perchance, As I do hope, . . it was thy doing, Madoc? Is he aboard the fleet? I would he were! Madoc replied; with what a lighten'd heart Then should I sail away! Ririd is there Alone... alas! that this was done so late! Reproach me not! half sullenly the King, Answering, exclaim'd; Madoc, reproach me not! Thou know'st how hardly I attain'd the throne; And is it strange that I should guard with fear The precious prize? . . Now, . . when I would have taken Thy counsel, . . be the evil on his head! Blame me not now, my brother, lest sometimes I call again to mind thy parting words In sorrow! God be with thee! Madoc cried; And if at times the harshness of a heart, Too prone to wrath, have wrong'd thee, let these tears Efface all faults, I leave thee, O my brother, With all a brother's feelings! So he said, And grasp'd, with trembling tenderness, his hand, Then calm'd himself, and moved toward the boat. Emma, though tears would have their way and sighs Would swell, suppressing still all words of woe, Follow'd Goervyl to the extremest shore. But then as on the plank the maid set foot, Did Emma, staying her by the hand, pluck out The crucifix, which next her heart she wore In reverence to its relic, and she cried, Yet ere we part change with me, dear Goervyl, . . Dear sister, loved too well, or lost too soon! . . I shall betake me often to my prayers, Never in them, Goervyl, of thy name Unmindful; . . thou too wilt remember me Still in thine orisons; . . but God forefend That ever misery should make thee find This Cross thy only comforter! She said, And kiss'd the holy pledge, as each to each Transferr'd the mutual gift. Nor could the Maid Answer for agony, to that farewell; She held Queen Emma to her breast, and close She clasp'd her with a strong convulsive sob, Silently. Madoc too in silence went, But prest a kiss on Emma's lips, and left His tears upon her cheek. With dizzy eyes Gazing she stood, nor saw the boat push off, . . The dashing of the oars awaken'd her; She wipes her tears away, to view once more Those dear familiar faces; . . they are dim In the distance; never shall her waking eye Behold them, till the hour of happiness, When death hath made her pure for perfect bliss! Two hearts alone of all that company, Of all the thousands who beheld the scene, Partook unmingled joy. Dumb with delight, Young Hoel views the ships and feels the boat Rock on the heaving waves; and Llaian felt Comfort, . . though sad, yet comfort, . . that for her No eye was left to weep, nor heart to mourn. Hark! 'tis the mariners with voice attuned Timing their toil! and now with gentle gales, Slow from the holy haven they depart. XVIII. RODRI. Now hath the evening settled; the broad Moon Rolls through the rifted clouds. With gentle gales Slowly they glide along, when they behold A boat with press of sail and stress of oar Speed forward to the fleet; and now, arrived Beside the Chieftain's vessel, one enquires If Madoc be aboard? the answer given, Swift he ascended up the lofty side. With joyful wonder did the Ocean Lord Again behold Llewelyn; but he gazed Doubtfully on his comrade's countenance, . . A meagre man, severe of brow, his eye Stern. Thou dost view me, Madoc, he exclaim'd, As 'twere a stranger's face. I marvel not! The long afflictions of my prison house Have changed me. Rodri! cried the Prince, and fell Upon his neck; . . last night, subdued at length By my solicitations, did the King Send to deliver thee, that thou shouldst share My happy enterprize; . . and thou art come, Even to my wish! Nay, Madoc, nay, not so! He answered, with a stern and bitter smile; This gallant boy hath given me liberty, And I will pay him with his father's throne, Aye, by my father's soul! . . Last night we fled The house of bondage, and in the sea-caves By day we lurk'd securely. Here I come, Only to see thee once before I die, And say farewell, . . dear brother! Would to God This purpose could be changed! the Sea Lord cried; But thou art roused by wrongs, and who shall tame That lion heart? . . This only, if your lot Fall favourable, will I beseech of ye, That to his Queen the fair Plantagenet, All honourable humanity ye show, For her own virtue, and in gratitude, As she hath pleaded for you, and hath urged Her husband on your part, till it hath turn'd His wrath upon herself. Oh! deal ye by her As by your dearest sister in distress, For even so dear is she to Madoc's heart: And now I know she from Aberfraw's tower Watcheth these specks upon the moonlight sea. And weeps for my departure, and for me Sends up her prayers to Heaven, nor thinks that now I must make mine to man in her behalf! Quoth Rodri, Rest assured for her. I swear, By our dead mother, so to deal with her As thou thyself wouldst dictate, as herself Shall wish. The tears fell fast from Madoc s eyes: O Britain! O my country! he exclaim'd, For ever thus by civil strife convulsed, Thy children's blood flowing to satisfy Thy children's rage, how wilt thou still support The struggle with the Saxon? Rodri cried, Our strife shall not be long. Mona will rise With joy, to welcome me her rightful Lord; And woe be to the King who rules by fear, When danger comes against him! Fear not thou For Britain! quoth Llewelyn; for not yet The country of our fathers shall resign Her name among the nations. Though her Sun Slope from his eminence, the voice of man May yet arrest him on his downward way. My dreams by day, my visions in the night, Are of her welfare. I shall mount the throne, . . Yes, Madoc! and the Bard of years to come, Who harps of Arthur's and of Owen's deeds, Shall with the Worthies of his country rank Llewelyn's name. Dear Uncle, fare thee well! . . And I almost could wish I had been born Of humbler lot, that I might follow thee, Companion of this noble enterprise. Think of Llewelyn often, who will oft Remember thee in love! For the last time He press'd his Uncle's hand, and Rodri gave The last farewell; then went the twain their way. So over ocean through the moonlight waves, Prince Madoc sail'd with all his company. No nobler crew filled that heroic bark, Which bore the first adventurers of the deep To seek the Golden Fleece on barbarous shores: Nor richlier fraught did that illustrious fleet Home to the Happy Island hold its way, When Amadis with his prime chivalry, He of all chivalry himself the flower, Came from the rescue, proud of Roman spoils, And Oriana, freed from Roman thrall. MADOC IN AZTLAN. PART THE SECOND. I. THE RETURN TO AZTLAN. Now go your way, ye gallant company, God and good Angels guard ye as ye go! Blow fairly, Winds of Heaven! Ye Ocean Waves, Swell not in anger to that fated fleet! For not of conquest greedy nor of gold, Seek they the distant world... Blow fairly, Winds! Waft, Waves of Ocean, well your blessed load! Fair blew the Winds, and safely did the Waves Bear that beloved charge. It were a tale Would rouse adventurous courage in a boy, Making him long to be a mariner That he might rove the main, if I should tell How pleasantly for many a summer-day, Over the sunny sea with wind at will, Prince Madoc sail'd; and of those happy Isles, Which had he seen ere that appointed storm Drove southward his slope course, there he had pitch'd His tent, and blest his lot that it had fallen In land so fair; and human blood had reek'd Daily on Aztlan's devilish altars still. But other doom was his, more arduous toil Yet to achieve, worse danger to endure, Worse evil to be quell'd, and higher good Which passeth not away educed from ill; Whereof all unforeseeing, yet for all Prepared at heart, he over ocean sails, Wafted by gentle winds o'er gentle waves, As if the elements combined to serve The perfect Prince, by God and man beloved. And now how joyfully he views the land, Skirting like morning clouds the dusky sea; With what a searching eye recals to mind Foreland and creek and cape; how happy now Up the great river bends at last his way! No watchman had been station'd on the height To seek his sails, . . for with Cadwallon's hope Too much of doubt was blended and of fear: Yet thitherward whene'er he walk'd abroad His face, as if instinctively, was turn'd; And duly morn and eve Lincoya there, As though religion led his duteous feet, Went up to gaze. He on a staff had scored The promised moons and days; and many a time Counting again its often-told account, So to beguile impatience, day by day Smooth'd off with more delight the daily notch. But now that the appointed time was nigh, Did that perpetual presence of his hope Haunt him, and mingle with his sleep, and mar The natural rest, and trouble him by day, That all his pleasure was at earliest light To take his station, and at latest eve, If he might see the sails where far away Through wide savannahs roll'd the silver stream. Oh then with what a sudden start his blood Flow'd from its quicken'd spring, when far away He spied the glittering topsails! For a while Distrustful of that happy sight, till now Slowly he sees them rise, and wind along Through wide savannahs up the silver stream. Then with a breathless speed he flies to spread The joy; and with Cadwallon now descends, And drives adown the tide the light canoe. And mounts the vessel-side, and once again Falls at the Ocean Lord's beloved feet. First of the general weal did Madoc ask; Cadwallon answer'd, All as yet is well, And, by this seasonable aid secured, Will well remain... Thy father? quoth the Prince. Even so, replied Cadwallon, as that eye Of hesitation augurs, . . fallen asleep. The good old man remember'd thee in death, And blest thee ere he died. By this the shores And heights were throng'd; from hill to hill, from rock To rock, the shouts of welcome rung around. Forward they press to view the man beloved, Britons and Hoamen with one common joy Hailing their common friend. Happy that day Was he who heard his name from Madoc's voice; Happy who met the greeting of his eye; Yea happy he who shared his general smile, Amid the unacknowledged multitude. Caermadoc, . . by that name Cadwallon's love Call'd it in memory of the absent Prince, . . Stood in a mountain vale, by rocks and heights, A natural bulwark, girt. A rocky stream Which from the fells came down there spread itself Into a quiet lake, to compass which Had been a two hours' pleasurable toil; And he, who from a well-strung bow could send His shaft across, had needs a sinewy arm, And might from many an archer far and near Have borne away the bell. Here had the Chief Chosen his abiding place, for strength preferr'd, Where vainly might an host in equal arms Attempt the difficult entrance; and for all That could delight the eye and heart of man; Whate'er of beauty or of usefulness Heart could desire, or eye behold, being here. What he had found an idle wilderness Now gave rich increase to the husbandmen, For Heaven had blest their labour. Flourishing He left the happy vale; and now he saw More fields reclaim'd, more habitations rear'd, More harvests rising round. The reptile race, And every beast of rapine, had retired From man's asserted empire; and the sound Of axe and dashing oar, and fisher's net, And song beguiling toil, and pastoral pipe, Were heard, where late the solitary hills Gave only to the mountain-cataract Their wild response. Here, Urien, cried the Prince, These craggy heights and overhanging groves Will make thee think of Gwyneth. And this hut, Rejoin'd Cadwallon, with its roof of reeds, Goervyl, is our palace: it was built With lighter labour than Aberfraw's towers; Yet, Lady, safer are its wattled sides Than Mona's kingly walls... Like Gwyneth, said he? Oh no! we neighbour nearer to the Sun, And with a more benignant eye the Lord Of Light beholds us here. So thus did they Cheerfully welcome to their new abode These, who albeit aweary of their way, And glad to reach at length the place of rest, Felt their hearts overburthen'd, and their eyes Ready to overflow. Yet not the less The buzz of busy joy was heard around, Where every dwelling had its guest, and all Gave the long eve to hospitable mirth. II. THE TIDINGS. But when the Lord of Ocean from the stir And tumult was retired, Cadwallon then Thus render'd his account. When we had quell'd The strength of Aztlan, we should have thrown down Her altars, cast her Idols to the fire, And on the ruins of her fanes accurst Planted the Cross triumphant. Vain it is To sow the seed where noxious weeds and briars Must choke it in the growth. Yet I had hope The purer influence of exampled good Might to the saving knowledge of the truth Lead this bedarken'd race; and when thy ship Fell down the stream to distant Britain bound, All promised well. The strangers' God had proved Mightier in war; and Aztlan could not choose But see, nor seeing could she fail to love, The freedom of his service. Few were now The offerings at her altars, few the youths And virgins to the temple-toils devote. Therefore the Priests combined to save their craft; And soon the rumour ran of evil signs And tokens; in the temple had been heard Wailings and loud lament; the eternal fire Gave dismally a dim and doubtful flame; And from the censer, which at morn should stean Sweet odours to the sun, a fetid cloud Black and portentous rose. And now no Priest Approach'd our dwelling. Even the friendly Prince Yuhidthiton was at Caermadoc now Rarely a guest; and if that tried good-will Which once he bore us did at times appear, A sullen gloom and silence like remorse Followed the imagined crime. But I the while Reck'd not the brooding of the storm; for then My father to the grave was hastening down. Patiently did the pious man endure, In faith anticipating blessedness, Already more than man in those sad hours When man is meanest. I sate by his side, And pray'd with him and talk'd with him of death And life to come. O Madoc! those were hours Which even in anguish gave my soul a joy: I think of them in solitude, and feel The comfort of my faith. But when that time Of bitterness was past and I return'd To daily duties, no suspicious sign Betoken'd ill; the Priests among us came As heretofore, and I their intercourse Encouraged as I could, suspecting nought, Nor conscious of the subtle-minded men I dealt with, how inveterate in revenge, How patient in deceit. Lincoya first Forewarn'd me of the danger. He, thou know'st, Had from the death of sacrifice escaped, And lived a slave among a distant tribe, When seeing us he felt a hope, that we, Lords as he deem'd us of the Elements, Might pity his poor countrymen opprest, And free them from their bondage. Didst thou hear How from yon bloody altars he was saved? For in the eternal chain his fate and ours Were link'd together then. The Prince replied, I did but hear a broken tale. Tell on! Among the Gods of yon unhappy race, Tezcalipoca as the chief they rank, Or with the chief co-equal; Maker he, And Master of created things esteem'd. He sits upon a throne of trophied skulls, Hideous and huge; a shield is on his arm, And with his black right hand he lifts, as though In wrath, the menacing spear. His festival, Of all this wicked nation's wicked rites, With most solemnity and circumstance And pomp of hellish piety, is held. From all whom evil fortune hath subdued To their inhuman thraldom, they select Him whom they judge, for comely countenance And shapely form and all good natural gifts, Worthiest to be the victim; and for this Was young Lincoya chosen, being in truth The flower of all his nation. For twelve months, Their custom is, that this appointed youth Be as the Idol's living image held. Garb'd therefore like the Demon Deity, Whene'er he goes abroad, an antic train With music and with dance attend his way; The crowd before him fall and worship him; And those infernal Priests who guard him then, To be their victim and their feast at last, At morning and at evening incense him, And mock him with knee-reverence. Twenty days Before the bloody festival arrive, As 'twere to make the wretch in love with life, Four maids, the loveliest of the land, are given In spousals. With Lincoya all these rites Duly were kept; and at the stated time, Four maids, the loveliest of the land, were his. Of these was one, whom even at that hour He learnt to love, so excellently good Was she; and she loved him and pitied him. She is the daughter of an aged Priest; I oftentimes have seen her; and in truth, Compared with Britain's maids so beautiful, Or with the dark-eyed daughters of the South, She would be lovely still. Her cotton vest Falls to the knee, and leaves her olive arms Bare in their beauty; loose, luxuriant, long, Flow the black tresses of her glossy hair; Mild is her eye's jet lustre; and her voice! . . A soul which harbour'd evil never breathed Such winning tones. Thou know'st how manfully These tribes, as if insensible to pain, Welcome their death in battle, or in bonds Defy their torturers. To Lincoya's mind Long preparation now had made his fate Familiar; and, he says, the thought of death Broke not his sleep, nor mingled with his dreams, Till Coätel was his. But then it woke; . . It hung, . . it prest upon him like a weight On one who scarce can struggle with the waves; And when her soul was full of tenderness, That thought recurring to her, she would rest Her cheek on his and weep. The day drew nigh; And now the eve of sacrifice was come... What will not woman, gentle woman, dare, When strong affection stirs her spirit up? . . She gather'd herbs, which, like our poppy, bear The seed of sleep, and with the temple-food Mingled their power; herself partook the food, So best to lull suspicion; and the youth, Instructed well, when all were laid asleep, Fled far away. After our conquering arms Had freed the Hoamen from their wretched yoke, Lincoya needed but his Coätel To fill his sum of earthly happiness. Her to the temple had her father's vow Awhile devoted, and some moons were still To pass away, ere yet she might become A sojourner with us, Lincoya's wife, When from the Paba's wiles his watchful mind Foreboded ill. He bade me take good heed, And fear the sudden kindness of a foe. I started at his words; . . these artful men, Hostile at heart, as well we knew they were, These were lip-lavish of their friendship now, And courted confidence, while our tried friend Yuhidthiton, estranged, a seldom guest, Sullen and joyless, seem'd to bear at heart Something that rankled there. These things were strange; The omens too had ceased; . . we heard no more Of twilight voices, nor the unholy cloud Steam'd from the morning incense. Why was this? Young Malinal had from the hour of peace Been our in-dweller, studious to attain Our language and our arts. To him I told My doubts, assured of his true love and truth; For he had learnt to understand and feel Our holy faith, and tended like a son Cynetha's drooping age, and shared with me His dying benediction. He, thus long Intent on better things, had been estranged From Aztlan and her councils; but at this He judged it for her welfare and for ours, Now to resume his rank; . . belike his voice Might yet be heard, or, if the worst befel, His timely warning save us from the snare. But in their secret councils Malinal No longer bore a part; the Chiefs and King Yielding blind reverence to the Pabas now, Deluded or dismay'd. He sent to say Some treachery was design'd, and bade me charge His brother with the crime. On that same day, Lincoya came from Aztlan; he had found Coätal labouring with a wretchedness She did not seek to hide; and when the youth Reveal'd his fear, he saw her tawny cheek Whiten, and round his neck she clung and wept. She told him something dreadful was at hand, She knew not what: That, in the dead of night, Coänocotzin at Mexitli's shrine Had stood with all his nobles; human blood Had then been offer'd up, and secret vows Vow'd with mysterious horror: That but late, When to her father of the days to come She spake, and of Lincoya and her lot Among the strangers, he had frown'd, and strove Beneath dissembled anger to conceal Visible grief. She knew not what to fear, But something dreadful surely was at hand, And she was wretched. When I heard these things, Yuhidthiton and the Priest Helhua Were in our dwellings. Them I call'd apart... There should be peace between us I began; Why is it otherwise? The Priest replied, Is there not peace, Cadwallon? Seek we not More frequent and more friendly intercourse, Even we, the servants of our Country-Gods, Whose worship ye have changed, and for whose sake We were and would have been your enemies? But as those Gods have otherwise ordain'd, Do we obey. Why therefore is this doubt? The Power who led us hither, I replied, Over the world of waters, who hath saved, And who will save his people, warns me now. Then on Yuhidthiton I fix'd my eye. Danger is near! I cried; I know it near! It comes from Aztlan. His disorder'd cheek, And the forced and steady boldness of his eye, Which in defiance met the look it fear'd, Confess'd the crime. I saw his inward shame; Yet with a pride like angry innocence Did he make answer, I am in your hands, And you believe me treacherous! . . Kill me now! Not so, Yuhidthiton! not so! quoth I; You were the Strangers' friend, and yet again That wisdom may return. We are not changed; . Lovers of peace, we know, when danger comes, To make the evil on the guilty head Fall heavily and sure! With our good arms, And our good cause, and that Almighty One, We are enough, had we no other aid, We of Caermadoc here, to put to shame Aztlan, with all her strength and all her wiles. But even now is Madoc on the seas; He leads our brethren here; and should he find That Aztlan hath been false, . . oh! hope not then, By force or fraud, to baffle or elude Inevitable vengeance! While ye may, Look to your choice; for we are friends or foes, Even to your own desert. So saying, I left The astonish'd men, whose unprovided minds Fail'd them; nor did they aim at answer more, But homeward went their way. Nor knew I then, . . For this was but a thing of yesterday, . . How near the help I boasted. Now I trust, Thy coming shall discomfit all their wiles. III NEOLIN. Not yet at rest, my Sister! quoth the Prince, As at her dwelling-door he saw the Maid Sit gazing on that lovely moonlight scene: . . To bed, Goervyl. Dearest, what hast thou To keep thee wakeful here at this late hour, When even I shall bid a truce to thought, And lay me down in peace? . . Good night, Goervyl! Dear sister mine, . . my own dear mother's child! She rose, and bending on with lifted arms, Met the fond kiss, obedient then withdrew. Yet could not he so lightly as he ween'd Lay wakeful thoughts aside; for he foresaw Long strife and hard adventure to achieve, And forms of danger vague disturb'd his dreams. Early at morn the colonists arose; Some pitch the tent-pole, and pin down the lines That stretch the o'er-awning canvass; to the wood Others with saw and axe and bill for stakes And undergrowth to weave the wicker walls; These to the ships, with whom Cadwallon sends The Elk and Bison, broken to the yoke. Ere noon Erillyab and her son arrived, To greet the Chief. She wore no longer now The lank loose locks of careless widowhood; Her braided tresses round her brow were bound, Bedeck'd with tufts of grey and silvery plumes Pluck'd from the eagle's pennons. She with eye And countenance which spake no feign'd delight, Welcomed her great deliverer. But her son Had Nature character'd so legibly, That when his tongue told fair his face bewray'd The lurking falsehood; sullen, slow of speech, Savage, down-looking, dark, that at his words Of welcome, Madoc in his heart conceived Instinctive enmity. In a happy hour Did the Great Spirit, said Erillyab, Give bidding to the Winds to speed thee here! For this I made my prayer; and when He sent For the Beloved Teacher, to restore him Eyesight and youth, of him I then besought, As he had been thy friend and ours on earth, That he would intercede... Brother, we know That the Great Spirit loves thee; He hath blest Thy going and thy coming, and thy friends Have prosper'd for thy sake; and now when first The Powers of Evil do begin to work, Lo! thou art here! . . Brother, we have obeyed Thy will, and the Beloved Teacher's words Have been our law; but now the Evil Ones Cry out for blood, and say they are athirst, And threaten vengeance. I have brought the Priest To whom they spake in darkness... Thou art wise, And the Great Spirit will enlighten thee; . . We know not what to answer... Tell thy tale, Neolin! Hereat did Madoc fix upon him A searching eye; but he, no whit abash'd, Began with firm effrontery his speech. The Feast of the Departed is at hand, And I, in preparation, on the Field Of the Spirit past the night. It came to me In darkness, after midnight, when the moon Was gone, and all the stars were blotted out; It gather'd round me, with a noise of storms, And enter'd into me, and I could feel It was the Snake-God roll'd and writhed within; And I too with the inward agony, Roll'd like a snake and writhed. Give! give! he cried: I thirst! . . His voice was in me, and it burnt Like fire, and all my flesh and bones were shaken; Till, with a throe which seem'd to rend my joints Asunder, he past forth, and I was left Speechless and motionless, gasping for breath. Then Madoc, turning to Ayayaca, Enquired, who is the man? . . The good old Priest Replied, he hath attended from his youth The Snake-God's temple, and received for him His offerings, and perform'd his sacrifice, Till the Belov'd Teacher made us leave The wicked way. Hear me! quoth Neolin, With antic gesture and loud vehemence; Before this generation, and before These ancient forests, . . yea, before yon lake Was hollow'd out, or one snow-feather fell On yonder mountain-top, now never bare, . . Before these things I was, . . where, or from whence, I know not, . . who can tell? But then I was, And in the shadow of the Spirit stood; And I beheld the Spirit, and in him Saw all things, even as they were to be; And I held commune with him, not of words, But thought with thought. Then was it given me That I should choose my station when my hour Of mortal birth was come, . . hunter, or chief, Or to be mightiest in the work of war, Or in the shadow of the Spirit live, And He in me. According to my choice, For ever, overshadow'd by his power, I walk among mankind. At times I feel not The burthen of his presence; then am I Like other men; but when the season comes, Or if I seek the visitation, then He fills me, and my soul is carried on, And then do I forelive the race of men, So that the things that will be, are to me Past. Amalahta lifted then his eyes A moment; . . It is true, he cried; we know He is a gifted man, and wise beyond The reach of mortal powers. Ayayaca Hath also heard the warning. As I slept, Replied the aged Priest, upon the Field Of the Spirit, a loud voice awaken'd me, Crying, I thirst! Give, . . give! or I will take! And then I heard a hiss, as if a snake Were threatening at my side... But saw you nothing? Quoth Madoc... Nothing; for the night was dark. And felt you nothing? said the Ocean Prince. He answered, Nothing; only sudden fear... No inward struggle, like possession? . . None. I thought of the Beloved Teacher's words, And crost myself, and then he had no power. Thou hast slept heretofore upon the Field, Said Madoc; didst thou never witness voice, Or ominous sound? Ayayaca replied, Certes the Field is holy! it receives, All the year long, the operative power Which falleth from the sky, or from below Pervades the earth; no harvest groweth there, Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb, is left to spring; But there the virtue of the elements Is gathered, till the circle of the months Be full; then, when the Priest, by mystic rites, Long vigils, and long abstinence prepared, Goeth there to pass the appointed night alone, The whole collected influence enters him Doubt not but I have felt strange impulses On that mysterious Field, and in my dreams Been visited; and have heard sounds in the air, I knew not what; . . but words articulate Never till now. It was the Wicked One! He wanted blood. Who says the Wicked One? It was our fathers' God! cried Neolin. Sons of the Ocean, why should we forsake The worship of our fathers? Ye obey The White-Man's Maker; but to us was given A different skin and speech and land and law. The Snake-God understands the Red-Man's prayer, And knows his wants and loves him. Shame be to us, That since the Stranger here set foot among us We have let his lips be dry! Enough! replied Madoc, who at Cadwallon's look represt His answering anger. We will hold a talk Of this hereafter. Be ye sure, meantime, That the Great Spirit will from Evil Powers Protect his people. This, too, be ye sure, That every deed of darkness shall be brought To light, . . and woe be to the lying lips! IV. AMALAHTA. Soon as the coming of the fleet was known, Had Queen Erillyab sent her hunters forth. They from the forest now arrive, with store Of venison; fires are built before the tents, Where Llaian and Goervyl for their guests, Direct the feast; and now the ready board With grateful odour steams. But while they sate At meat, did Amalahta many a time Lift his slow eye askance, and eagerly Gaze on Goervyl's beauty; for whate'er In man he might have thought deformed or strange Seemed beautiful in her, . . her golden curls, Bright eyes of heavenly blue, and that clear skin, Blooming with health and youth and happiness. He, lightly yielding to the impulse, bent His head aside, and to Erillyab spake; Mother, said he, tell them to give to me That woman for my wife, that we may be Brethren and friends. She, in the same low tone Rebuked him, in her heart too well aware How far unworthy he. Abash'd thereby, As he not yet had wholly shaken off Habitual reverence, he sate sullenly, Brooding in silence his imagined wiles, By sight of beauty made more apt for ill; For he himself being evil, good in him Work'd evil. And now Madoc, pouring forth The ripe metheglin, to Erillyab gave The horn of silver brim. Taste, Queen and friend, Said he, what from our father-land we bring, The old beloved beverage. Sparingly Drink, for it hath a strength to stir the brain, And trouble reason, if intemperate lips Abuse its potency. She took the horn, And sipt with wary wisdom... Canst thou teach us The art of this rare beverage? quoth the Queen, Or is the gift reserved for ye alone, By the Great Spirit, who hath favour'd ye In all things above us? . . The Chief replied, All that we know of useful and of good Ye also shall be taught, that we may be One people. While he spake, Erillyab past The horn to Amalahta. Sparingly! Madoc exclaim'd; but when the savage felt The luscious flavour, and the poignant life, He heeded nought beyond the immediate joy. Deep did he drink, and still with clenching hands Struggled, when from his lips unsatisfied, Erillyab pluck'd the horn with sharp reproof, Chiding his stubborn wilfulness. Ere long The generous liquor flush'd him: he could feel His blood play faster, and the joyful dance Of animal life within him. Bolder grown, He at Goervyl lifts no longer now The secret glance, but gloats with greedy eye; Till, at the long and loathsome look abash'd, She rose, and nearer to her brother drew, On light pretence of speech, being half in fear. But he, regardless of Erillyab now, To Madoc cried aloud, Thou art a King, And I a King! . . Give me thy sister there, To be my wife, and then we will be friends, And reign together. Let me answer him, Madoc! Cadwallon cried. I better know Their language, and will set aside all hope, Yet not incense the savage... A great thing, Prince Amalahta, hast thou ask'd! said he. Nor is it in Lord Madoc's power to give Or to withhold; for marriage is with us The holiest ordinance of God, whereon The bliss or bane of human life depends. Love must be won by love, and heart to heart Link'd in mysterious sympathy, before We pledge the marriage-vow; and some there are, Who hold, that, e'er we enter into life, Soul hath with soul been mated, each for each Especially ordain'd. Prince Madoc's will Avails not, therefore, where this secret bond Hath not been framed in Heaven. The skilful speech Which, with wild faith and reason, thus confirm'd Yet temper'd the denial, for a while Silenced him, and he sate in moody dreams Of snares and violence. Soon a drunken thirst, And longing for the luscious beverage, Drove those dark thoughts aside. More drink! quoth he. Give me the drink! . . Madoc again repeats His warning, and again with look and voice Erillyab chides; but he of all restraint Impatient, cries aloud, Am I a child? Give! give! or I will take! . . . Perchance ye think I and my God alike cry out in vain! But ye shall find us true! Give him the horn! Cadwallon answer'd; there will come upon him Folly and sleep, and then an after pain, Which may bring wisdom with it, if he learn Therefrom to heed our warning... As thou say'st, No child art thou! . . the choice is in thy hand; . . Drink, if thou wilt, and suffer, and in pain Remember us. He clench'd the horn, and swill'd The sweet intoxication copious down. So bad grew worse. The potent draught provoked Fierce pride and savage insolence. Aye! now It seems that I have taught ye who I am! The inebriate wretch exclaim'd. This land is mine, Not hers; the kingdom and the power are mine; I am the master! Hath it made thee mad? Erillyab cried... Ask thou the Snake-God that! Quoth he; ask Neolin and Aztlan that! Hear me, thou Son of the Waters! wilt thou have me For friend or foe? . . Give me that woman there, And store me with this blessed beverage, And thou shalt dwell in my domains, . . or else, Blood! blood! The Snake-God calls for blood; the Gods Of Aztlan and the people call for blood; They call on me, and I will give them blood, Till they have had their fill. Meanwhile the Queen, In wonder and amazement heard and grief; Watching the fiendish workings of his face, And turning to the Prince at times, as if She look'd to him for comfort. Give him drink, To be at peace! quoth Madoc. The good mead Did its good office soon; his dizzy eyes Roll'd with a sleepy swim; the joyous thrill Died away; and as every limb relax'd, Down sunk his heavy head and down he fell. Then said the Prince, We must rejoice in this, O Queen and friend, that, evil though it be, Evil is brought to light; he hath divulged In this mad mood, what else had been conceal'd By guilty cunning. Set a watch upon him And on Priest Neolin; they plot against us; Your fall and mine do they alike conspire, Being leagued with Aztlan to destroy us both. Thy son will not remember that his lips Have let the treason pass. Be wary then, And we shall catch the crafty in the pit Which they have dug for us. Erillyab cast A look of anger, made intense by grief, On Amalahta... Cursed be the hour Wherein I gave thee birth! she cried; that pain Was light to what thy base and brutal nature Hath sent into my soul... But take thou heed! I have borne many a woe and many a loss, . . My father's realm, the husband of my youth, My hope in thee! . . all motherly love is gone, . . Sufferance well nigh worn out. When she had ceased, Still the deep feeling fill'd her, and her eye Dwelt on him, still in thought. Brother! she cried As Madoc would have soothed her, doubt not me! Mine is no feeble heart. Abundantly Did the Great Spirit overpay all woes, And this the heaviest, when he sent thee here, The friend and the deliverer. Evil tongues May scatter lies; bad spirits and bad men May league against thy life; but go thou on, Brother! He loves thee and will be thy shield. V. WAR DENOUNCED This is the day, when, in a foreign grave, King Owen's relics shall be laid to rest. No bright emblazonries bedeck'd his bier, No tapers blazed, no prelate sung the mass, No choristers the funeral dirge intoned, No mitred abbots, and no tonsured train, Lengthen'd the pomp of ceremonious woe. His decent bier was with white linen spread And canopied; two elks and bisons yoked, Drew on the car; foremost Cadwallon bore The Crucifix; with single voice distinct, The good priest Llorien chaunted loud and deep The solemn service; Madoc next the bier Follow'd his father's corpse; bareheaded then Came all the people, silently and slow. The burial-place was in a grassy plat, A little level glade of sunny green, Between the river and a rocky bank, Which, like a buttress, from the precipice Of naked rock sloped out. On either side 'Twas skirted by the woodlands. A stone cross Stood on Cynetha's grave, sole monument, Beneath a single cocoa, whose straight trunk Rose like an obelisk, and waved on high Its palmy plumage, green and never sere. Here by Cynetha's side, with Christian prayers, All wrongs forgotten now, was Owen laid. Rest, King of Gwyneth, in a foreign grave! From foul indignity of Romish pride And bigot priesthood, from a falling land Thus timely snatch'd, and from the impending yoke, . . Rest in the kingdom of thy noble son! Ambassadors from Aztlan in the vale Awaited their return, . . Yuhidthiton, Chief of the Chiefs, and Helhua the priest; With these came Malinal. They met the Prince, And with a sullen stateliness return'd His salutation, then the Chief began; Lord of the Strangers, hear me! by my voice The People and the Pabas and the King Of Aztlan speak. Our injured Gods have claim'd Their wonted worship, and made manifest Their wrath; we dare not impiously provoke The Dreadful. Worship ye in your own way; But we must keep the path our fathers kept. We parted, O Yuhidthiton! as friends And brethren, said the Christian Prince; . . alas, That this should be our meeting! When we pledged, In the broad daylight and the eye of Heaven, Our hands in peace, ye heard the will of God, And felt and understood. This calm assent Ye would belie, by midnight miracles Scared, and such signs of darkness as beseem The Demons whom ye dread; or likelier Duped by the craft of those accursed men, Whose trade is blood. Ask thou of thine own heart, Yuhidthiton, . . But Helhua broke his speech; Our bidding is to tell thee, quoth the Priest, That Aztlan hath restored, and will maintain, Her ancient faith. If it offendeth thee, Move thou thy dwelling place! Madoc replied, This day have I deposited in earth My father's bones, and where his bones are laid, There mine shall moulder. Malinal at that Advanced; . . Prince Madoc, said the youth, I come, True to thy faith and thee, and to the weal Of Aztlan true, and bearing, for that truth, Reproach and shame and scorn and obloquy. In sorrow come I here, a banish'd man; Here take, in sorrow, my abiding place, Cut off from all my kin, from all old ties Divorced; all dear familiar countenances No longer to be present to my sight; The very mother-language which I learnt, A lisping baby on my mother's knees, No more with its sweet sounds to comfort me. So be it! . . To his brother then he turn'd; Yuhidthiton, said he, when thou shalt find, . . As find thou wilt, . . that those accursed men Have played the juggler with thee, and deceived Thine honest heart, . . when Aztlan groans in blood, . . Bid her remember then, that Malinal Is in the dwellings of her enemy; Where all his hope in banishment hath been To intercede for her, and heal her wounds, And mitigate her righteous punishment. Sternly and sullenly his brother heard; Yet hearken'd he as one whose heart perforce Supprest its instinct, and there might be seen A sorrow in his silent stubbornness. And now his ministers on either hand A water-vessel fill, and heap dry sedge And straw before his face, and fire the pile. He, looking upward, spread his arms and cried, Hear me, ye Gods of Aztlan, as we were, And are, and will be yours! Behold your foes! He stoopt, and lifted up one ample urn, . . Thus let their blood be shed! . . and far away He whirl'd the scattering water. Then again Raised the full vase, . . Thus let their lives be quench'd! And out he pour'd it on the flaming pile. Thesteam-cloud, hissing from the extinguish'd heap. Spread like a mist, and ere it melted off, Homeward the heralds of the war had turn'd. VI. THE FESTIVAL OF THE DEAD. The Hoamen in their Council-hall are met To hold the Feast of Souls; seat above seat, Ranged round the circling theatre they sit. No light but from the central fire, whose smoke, Slow passing through the over aperture, Excludes the day, and fills the conic roof, And hangs above them like a cloud. Around, The ghastly bodies of their chiefs are hung, Shrivell'd and parch'd by heat; the humbler dead Lie on the floor, . . white bones, exposed to view, On deer, or elk-skin laid, or softer fur, Or web, the work of many a mournful hour; The loathlier forms of fresh mortality Swathed, and in decent tenderness conceal'd. Beside each body pious gifts are laid, Mantle and belt and feathery coronal, The bow he used in war, his drinking shell, His arrows for the chace, the sarbacan, Through whose long tube the slender shaft, breath driven, Might pierce the winged game. Husbands and wives, Parents and children, there in death they lie; The widow'd and the parent and the child Look on in silence. Not a sound is heard But of the crackling brand, or mouldering fire, Or when, amid yon pendant string of shells, The slow wind wakes a shrill and feeble sound, . . A sound of sorrow to the mind attuned By sights of woe. Ayayaca at length Came forward: . . Spirits, is it well with ye? Is it well, Brethren? said the aged Priest; Have ye received your mourning, and the rites Of righteous grief? or round your dwelling-place Still do your shadows roam dissatisfied, And to the cries of wailing woe return A voice of lamentation? Teach us now, If we in aught have fail'd, that I, your Priest, When I shall join ye soon, as soon I must, May unimpeded pass the perilous floods, And in the Country of the Dead, be hail'd By you, with song and dance and grateful joy. So saying, to the Oracle he turn'd, A waiting there the silence which implied Peaceful assent. Against the eastern wall, Fronting the narrow portal's winding way, An Image stood: a cloak of fur disguised The rude proportion of its uncouth limbs; The skull of some old seer of days of old Topt it, and with a visor this was mask'd, Honouring the oracular Spirit, who at times There took his resting place. Ayayaca Repeated, Brethren, is it well with ye? And raised the visor. But he started back, Appall'd and shuddering; for a moony light Lay in its eyeless sockets, and there came From its immoveable and boney jaws A long deep groan, thrice utter'd, and thrice felt In every heart of all the hearers round. The good old Priest stood tottering, like a man Stricken with palsy; and he gazed with eyes Of asking horror round, as if he look'd For counsel in that fear. But Neolin Sprung boldly to the oracle, and cried, Speak, Spirit! tell us of our sin, and teach The atonement! A sepulchral voice replied, Ye have for other Gods forsaken us, And we abandon you! . . and crash with that, The Image fell. A loud and hideous shriek, As of a demon, Neolin set up; So wild a yell, that, even in that hour, It brought fresh terror to the startled ear. While yet they sate, pale and irresolute, Helhua the Azteca came in. He bore A shield and arrow, . . symbols these of war, Yet now beheld with hope, so great relief They felt his human presence. Hoamen, hear me! The messenger began; Erillyab hear, Priests, Elders, People! but hear chiefly thou Prince Amalahta, as of these by birth, So now of years mature, the rightful Lord! . . Shall it be peace or war? . . thus Aztlan saith; She, in her anger, from the land will root The Children of the Sea; but viewing you In mercy, to your former vassalage Invites ye, and remits the tribute lives, And for rebellion claimeth no revenge. Oh praise your Gods! cried Neolin, and hail This day-spring of new hope! Aztlan remits The tribute lives, . . what more could Madoc give? She claimeth no revenge, and if she claimed, He could not save. O Hoamen, bless your Gods; Appease them! Thou, Prince Amalahta, speak, And seize the mercy. Amalahta stood In act of speech; but then Erillyab rose... Who gives thee, Boy, this Elder's privilege? The Queen exclaim'd; . . and thou, Priest Neolin, Curb thou thy traitorous tongue! The reign is mine; I hold it from my father, he from his; Age before age, beyond the memory Of man it hath been thus. My father fell In battle for his people, and his sons Fell by his side; they perish'd, but their names Are with the names we love, . . their happy souls Pursue in fields of bliss the shadowy deer; The spirit of that noble blood which ran From their death-wounds, is in the ruddy clouds Which go before the Sun, when he comes forth In glory. Last of that illustrious race Was I, Erillyab. Ye remember well, Elders, that day when I assembled here The people, and demanded at their choice The worthiest, to perpetuate our old line Of Kings and Warriors... To the wind he spread His black and blood-red banner. Even now I hear his war drum's tripled sound, that call'd The youth to battle; even now behold The hope which lit his dark and fiery eye, And kindled with a sunnier glow his cheek, As he from yonder war-pole, in his pride, Took the death-doers down... Lo here the bones Of King Tepollomi! . . my husband's bones! . . There should be some among ye who beheld, When, all with arrows quill'd, and clothed with blood As with a purple garment, he sustain'd The unequal conflict, till the Aztecas Took him at vantage, and their monarch's club Let loose his struggling soul. Look, Hoamen, here, See through how wide a wound his spirit fled! Twenty long years of mournful widowhood Have past away; so long have I maintain'd The little empire left us, loving well My people, and by them as well beloved. Say, Hoamen, am I still your Queen? At once The whole assembly rose with one acclaim, . . Still, O Erillyab, O Beloved, rule Thy own beloved people! But the Gods! Cried Amalahta, . . but the Oracle! The Oracle! quoth she; what hath it said That forty years of suffering hath not taught This wretched people? . . They abandon us? . . So let them go! Where were they at that hour, When like a blasting night-wind in the spring, The multitudes of Aztlan came upon us? Where were they when my father went to war? Where were they when thy father's stiffen'd corpse, Even after death a slave, held up the lamp To light his conqueror's revels? . . Think not, Boy, To palter with me thus! A fire may tremble Within the sockets of a skull, and groans May issue from a dead man's fleshless jaws, And images may fall, and yet no God Be there! . . If it had walk'd abroad with life, That had indeed been something! Then she turn'd Her voice toward the people... Ye have heard This Priest of Aztlan, whose insidious tongue Bids ye desert the Children of the Sea, And vow again your former vassalage. Speaks Aztlan of the former? O my people, I too could tell ye of the former days, When yonder plain was ours, with all its woods And waters and savannahs! . . of those days, When, following where her husband's stronger arm Had open'd the light glebe, the willing wife Dropt in the yellow maize; ere long to bear Its increase to the general store, and toss Her flowing tresses in the dance of joy. And I could tell ye how those summer stores Were hoarded for the invader's winter feasts; And how the widows clipt those flowing locks To strew them, . . not upon their husband's grave, . . Their husbands had no graves! . . but on the rocks And mountains in their flight. And even these rocks And mountains could not save us! Year by year Our babes, like firstlings of the flock, were cull'd To be the banquet of these Aztecas! This very wretch, who tells us of the past, Hath chosen them for the butchery... Oh, I thank you For this brave anger! . . In your name I take The war-gift! Gods of Aztlan, Helhua cried, As to Erillyab's ready hand he gave The deadly symbol, in your name I give The war-gift! Ye have thirsted over long; Take now your fill of blood! . . He turn'd away And Queen Erillyab bade the tribe fulfil Their customary rites. Each family Bore its own dead, and to the general grave, With melancholy song and sob of woe, The slow procession moves. The general grave Was delved within a deep and shady dell, Fronting a cavern in the rock, . . the scene Of many a bloody rite, ere Madoc came, . . A temple, as they deem'd, by Nature made, Where the Snake-Idol stood. On fur and cloth Of woven grass, they lay their burthens down, Within the ample pit; their offerings range Beside, and piously a portion take Of that cold earth, to which for ever now Consign'd, they leave their fathers, dust to dust; Sad relic that, and wise remembrancer. But as with bark and resinous boughs they pile The sepulchre, suddenly Neolin Sprung up aloft, and shriek'd, as one who treads Upon a viper in his heedless path. The God! the very God! he cried, and howl'd One long, shrill, piercing, modulated cry; Whereat from that dark temple issued forth A Serpent, huge and hideous. On he came, Strait to the sound, and curl'd around the Priest His mighty folds innocuous, overtopping His human height, and arching down his head, Sought in the hands of Neolin for food; Then questing, rear'd and stretch'd and waved his neck, And glanced his forky tongue. Who then had seen The man, with what triumphant fearlessness, Arms, thighs, and neck, and body, wreathed and ring'd In those tremendous folds, he stood secure, Play'd with the reptile's jaws, and call'd for food, Food for the present God! . . who then had seen The fiendish joy which fired his countenance, Might well have ween'd that he had summoned up The dreadful monster from its native Hell, By devilish power, himself a Fiend inflesh'd. Blood for the God! he cried; Lincoya's blood! Friend of the Serpent's foe! . . Lincoya's blood! Cried Amalahta, and the people turn'd Their eyes to seek the victim, as if each Sought his own safety in that sacrifice. Alone Erillyab raised her voice, confused But not confounded; she alone exclaim'd, Madoc shall answer this! Unheard her voice By the bewilder'd people, by the Priest Unheeded; and Lincoya sure had fallen The victim of their fear, had he been found In that wild hour; but when his watchful eye Beheld the Serpent from his den come forth, He fled to bear the tidings... Neolin Repeats the accursed call, Food for the God! Ayayaca, his unbelieving Priest! At once all eager eyes were fix'd on him, But he came forward calmly at the call; Lo! here am I! quoth he; and from his head Plucking the thin grey hairs he dealt them round.. Countrymen, kinsmen, brethren, children, take These in remembrance of me! there will be No relic of your aged Priest but this. From manhood to old age, full threescore years, Have I been your true servant: fit it is That I, who witness'd Aztlan's first assault, Should perish her last victim! . . and he moved Towards the death. But then Erillyab Seized him, and by the garment drew him back! . . By the Great Spirit, but he shall not die! The Queen exclaim'd; nor shalt thou triumph thus, Liar and traitor! Hoamen, to your homes! Madoc shall answer this! Irresolute They heard, and inobedient; to obey Fearing, yet fearful to remain. Anon, The Queen repeats her bidding, To your homes, My people! . . But when Neolin perceived The growing stir and motion of the crowd, As from the outward ring they moved away, He utter'd a new cry, and disentangling The passive reptile's folds, rush'd out among them, With outstretch'd hands, like one possess'd, to seize His victim. Then they fled; for who could tell On whom the madman, in that hellish fit, Might cast the lot? An eight-years' boy he seized And held him by the leg, and, whirling him In ritual dance, till breath and sense were gone, Set up the death-song of the sacrifice. Amalahta, and what others rooted love Of evil leagued with him, accomplices In treason, join'd the death-song and the dance. Some too there were, believing what they fear'd, Who yielded to their old idolatry, And mingled in the worship. Round and round The accursed minister of murder whirl'd His senseless victim; they too round and round In maddening motion, and with maddening cries Revolving, whirl'd and wheel'd. At length, when now, According to old rites, he should have dash'd On the stone Idol's head the wretch's brains, Neolin stopt, and once again began The long, shrill, piercing, modulated cry. The Serpent knew the call, and, rolling on, Wave above wave, his rising length, advanced His open jaws: then, with the expected prey, Glides to the dark recesses of his den. VII. THE SNAKE-GOD. Meantime Erillyab's messenger had girt His loins, and like a roebuck, o'er the hills He sped. He met Cadwallon and the Prince In arms, so quickly Madoc had obey'd Lincoya's call; at noon he heard the call, And still the sun was riding high in heaven, When up the valley where the Hoamen dwelt He led his twenty spears. O welcome, friend And brother! cried the Queen. Even as thou saidst So hath it proved; and those accursed schemes Of treachery, which that wretched boy reveal'd Under the influence of thy potent drink, Have ripen'd to effect. From what a snare The timely warning saved me! for, be sure, What I had seen I else should have believed, In utter fear confounded. The Great Spirit, Who taught thee to foresee the evil thing, Will give thee power to quell it. On they went Toward the dell, where now the Idolaters Had built their dedicated fire, and still With feast and fits of song and violent dance, Pursued their rites. When Neolin perceived The Prince approach, fearlessly he came forth, And raised his arm, and cried, Strangers, away! Away, profane! hence to your mother-land! Hence to your waters; for the God is here; . . He came for blood, and he shall have his fill! Impious, away! Seize him; exclaim'd the Prince; Nor had he time for motion nor for flight, So instantly was that command obey'd. Hoamen, said Madoc, hear me! . . I came here, Stranger alike to Aztlan and to you; I found ye an opprest, and wretched race, Groaning beneath your chains; at your request, For your deliverance, I unsheathed the sword, Redeem'd ye from your bondage, and preserved Your children from the slaughter. With those foes Whose burthen ye for forty years endured, This traitor hath conspired, against yourselves, Your Queen, and me your friend; the solemn faith Which in the face of yonder sun we pledged, Each to the other, this perfidious man Hath broken, and hath stain'd his hands this day With innocent blood. Life must atone for life: Ere I destroy the Serpent, whom his wiles Have train'd so well, last victim, he shall glut The monster's maw. Strike, man! quoth Neolin. This is my consummation! the reward Of my true faith! the best that I could ask, The best the God could give: . . . to rest in him, Body with body be incorporate, Soul into soul absorb'd, and I and He One life, inseparable, for evermore. Strike, I am wearv of this mortal part; Unite me to the God! Triumphantly He spake; the assembled people, at his words, With rising awe gazed on the miscreant; Madoc himself, when now he would have given The sign for death, in admiration paused, Such power hath fortitude. And he perceived The auspicious moment, and set up his cry. Forth, from the dark recesses of the cave, The Serpent came: the Hoamen at the sight Shouted, and they who held the Priest, appall'd Relax'd their hold. On came the mighty Snake, And twined, in many a wreath, round Neolin, Darting aright, aleft, his sinuous neck, With searching eye, and lifted jaw and tongue Quivering, and hiss as of a heavy shower Upon the summer woods. The Britons stood Astounded at the powerful reptile's bulk, And that strange sight. His girth was as of man, But easily could he have overtopp'd Goliath's helmed head, or that huge King Of Basan, hugest of the Anakim: What then was human strength, if once involved Within those dreadful coils? . . The multitude Fell prone, and worshipp'd; pale Erillyab grew, And turn'd upon the Prince a doubtful eye; The Britons too were pale, albeit they held Their spears protended; and they also look'd On Madoc, who the while stood silently, Contemplating how wiseliest he might cope With that surpassing strength. But Neolin, Well hoping now success, when he had awed The general feeling thus, exclaim'd aloud, Blood for the God! give him the Stranger's blood! Avenge him on his foes! And then, perchance, Terror had urged them to some desperate deed, Had Madoc ponder'd more, or paused in act One moment. From the sacrificial flames He snatch'd a firebrand, and with fire and sword, Rush'd at the monster: back the monster drew His head upraised recoiling, and the Prince Smote Neolin; all circled as he was, And clipt in his false Deity's embrace, Smote he the accursed Priest; the avenging sword Fell on his neck; through flesh and bone it drove Deep in the chest: the wretched criminal Totter'd, and those huge rings a moment held His bloody corpse upright, while Madoc struck The Serpent: twice he struck him, and the sword Glanced from the impenetrable scales; nor more Avail'd its thrust, though driven by that strong arm; For on the unyielding skin the temper'd blade Bent. He sprung upward then, and in the eyes Of the huge monster flashed the fiery brand. Impatient of the smoke and burning, back The reptile wreathed, and from his loosening clasp Dropt the dead Neolin, and turn'd, and fled To his dark den. The Hoamen, at that sight Raised a loud wonder-cry, with one accord, Great is the Son of Ocean, and his God Is mightiest! But Erillyab silently Approach'd the great Deliverer; her whole frame Trembled with strong emotion, and she took His hand, and gazed a moment earnestly, Having no power of speech, till with a gush Of tears her utterance came, and she exclaim'd, Blessed art thou, my brother! for the power Of God is in thee! . . and she would have kissed His hand in adoration; but he cried, God is indeed with us, and in his name Will we compleat the work! . . then to the cave Advanced and call'd for fire. Bring fire! quoth he; By his own element this spawn of hell Shall perish! and he enter'd, to explore The cavern depths. Cadwallon follow'd him, Bearing in either hand a flaming brand, For sword or spear avail'd not. Far in the hill Cave within cave, the ample grotto pierced, Three chambers in the rock. Fit vestibule The first to that wild temple, long and low, Shut out the outward day. The second vault Had its own daylight from a central chasm High in the hollow; here the Image stood, Their rude idolatry, . . a sculptured snake, . . If term of art may such mis-shapen form Beseem, . . around a human figure coil'd, And all begrimed with blood. The inmost cell Dark; and far up within its blackest depth They saw the Serpent's still small eye of fire. Not if they thinn'd the forest for their pile, Could they, with flame or suffocating smoke, Destroy him there; for through the open roof The clouds would pass away. They paused not long: Drive him beneath the chasm, Cadwallon cried, And hem him in with fire, and from above We crush him. Forth they went and climb'd the hill, With all their people. Their united strength Loosen'd the rocks, and ranged them round the brink, Impending. With Cadwallon on the height Ten Britons wait; ten with the Prince descend, And with a firebrand each in either hand, Enter the outer cave. Madoc advanced, And at the entrance of the inner den, He took his stand alone. A bow he bore, And arrows round whose heads dry tow was twined, In pine-gum dipt; he kindled these, and shot The fiery shafts. Upon the scaly skin, As on a rock, the bone-tipt arrows fell; But at their bright and blazing light effray'd, Out rush'd the reptile. Madoc from his path Retired against the side, and call'd his men, And in they came and circled round the Snake, And shaking all their flames, as with a wheel Of fire, they ring'd him in. From side to side The monster turns! . . where'er he turns, the flame Flares in his nostrils and his blinking eyes; Nor aught against the dreaded element Did that brute force avail, which could have crush'd Milo's young limbs, or Theban Hercules, Or old Manoah's mightier son, ere yet Shorn of his strength. They press him now, and now Give back, here urging, and here yielding way, Till right beneath the chasm they centre him. At once the crags are loosed, and down they fall Thundering. They fell like thunder, but the crash Of scale and bone was heard. In agony The Serpent writhed beneath the blow; in vain, From under the incumbent load essay'd To drag his mangled folds. One heavier stone Fasten'd and flatten'd him; yet still, with tail Ten cubits long, he lash'd the air, and foined From side to side, and raised his raging head Above the height of man, though half his length Lay mutilate. Who then had felt the force Of that wild fury, little had to him Buckler or corselet profited, or mail, Or might of human arm. The Britons shrunk Beyond its arc of motion; but the Prince Took a long spear, and springing on the stone Which fix'd the monster down, provoked his rage. Uplifts the Snake his head retorted, high He lifts it over Madoc, then darts down To seize his prey. The Prince, with foot advanced Inclines his body back, and points the spear With sure and certain aim, then drives it up, Into his open jaws; two cubits deep It pierced, the monster forcing on the wound. He closed his teeth for anguish, and bit short The ashen hilt. But not the rage which now Clangs all his scales, can from its seat dislodge The barbed shaft: nor those contortions wild, Nor those convulsive shudderings, nor the throes Which shake his inmost entrails, as with the air In suffocating gulps the monster now Inhales his own life-blood. The Prince descends; He lifts another lance; and now the Snake, Gasping, as if exhausted, on the ground Reclines his head one moment. Madoc seized That moment, planted in his eye the spear, Then setting foot upon his neck, drove down Through bone and brain and throat, and to the earth Infixed the mortal weapon. Yet once more The Snake essay'd to rise; his dying strength Fail'd him, nor longer did those mighty folds Obey the moving impulse, crush'd and scotch'd; In every ring, through all his mangled length, The shrinking muscles quiver'd, then collapsed In death. Cadwallon and his comrades now Enter the den; they roll away the crag Which held him down, pluck out the mortal spear, Then drag him forth to day; the force conjoin'd Of all the Britons difficultly drag His lifeless bulk. But when the Hoamen saw That form portentous trailing in its gore, The jaws which, in the morning, they had seen Purpled with human blood, now in their own Blackening, . . aknee they fell before the Prince, And in adoring admiration raised Their hands with one accord, and all in fear Worshipped the mighty Deicide. But he, Recoiling from those sinful honours, cried, Drag out the Idol now, and heap the fire, That all may be consumed! Forthwith they heap'd The sacrificial fire, and on the pile The Serpent and the Image and the corpse Of Neolin were laid; with prompt supply They feed the raging flames, hour after hour, Till now the black and nauseous smoke is spent, And mingled with the ruins of the pile, The undistinguishable ashes lay. Go! cried Prince Madoc, cast them in the stream, And scatter them upon the winds, that so No relic of this foul idolatry Pollute the land. To-morrow meet me here, Hoamen, and I will purify yon den Of your abominations. Come ye here With humble hearts; for ye, too, in the sight Of the Great Spirit, the Beloved One, Must be made pure, and cleansed from your offence, And take upon yourselves his holy law. VIII. THE CONVERSION OF THE HOAMEN. How beautiful, O Sun, is thine uprise, And on how fair a scene! Before the Cave The Elders of the Hoamen wait the will Of their Deliverer; ranged without their ring The tribe look on, thronging the narrow vale, And what of gradual rise the shelving combe Displayed, or steeper eminence of wood, Broken with crags and sunny slope of green, And grassy platform. With the Elders sate The Queen and Prince, their rank's prerogative, Excluded else for sex unfit, and youth For counsel immature. Before the arch, To that rude fane, rude portal, stands the Cross, By Madoc's hand victorious planted there. And lo, Prince Madoc comes! no longer mail'd In arms of mortal might; the spear and sword, The hauberk and the helmet laid aside, Gorget and gauntlet, grieves and shield, . . he comes In peaceful tunic clad, and mantle long; His hyacinthine locks now shadowing That face, which late, with iron overbrow'd Struck from within the aventayle such awe And terror to the heart. Bareheaded he, Following the servant of the altar, leads The reverential train. Before them, raised On high, the sacred images are borne; There, in faint semblance, holiest Mary bends In virgin beauty o'er her babe divine, . . A sight which almost to idolatry Might win the soul by love. But who can gaze Upon that other form, which on the rood In agony is stretch'd? . . his hands transfix'd, And lacerate with the body's pendent weight; The black and deadly paleness of his face, Streak'd with the blood which from that crown of scorn Hath ceased to flow; the side wound streaming still; And open still those eyes, from which the look Not yet hath past away, that went to Heaven, When, in that hour, the Son of Man exclaim'd, Forgive them, for they know not what they do! And now arrived before the cave, the train Halt: to the assembled elders, where they sate Ranged in half circle, Madoc then advanced, And raised, as if in act to speak, his hand. Thereat was every human sound suppress'd; And every quicken'd ear and eager eye Were center'd on his lips. The Prince began, . . Hoamen, friends, brethren, . . friends we have been long, And brethren shall be, ere the day go down, . . I come not here propounding doubtful things For counsel, and deliberate resolve Of searching thought; but with authority From Heaven, to give the law, and to enforce Obedience. Ye shall worship God alone, The One Eternal. That Beloved One Ye shall not serve with offer'd fruits, or smoke Of sacrificial fire, or blood, or life; Far other sacrifice he claims, . . a soul Resign'd, a will subdued, a heart made clean From all offence. Not for your lots on earth, Menial or mighty, slave or highly-born, For cunning in the chase, or strength in war, Shall ye be judged hereafter; . . as ye keep The law of love, as ye shall tame your wrath, Forego revenge, forgive your enemies, Do good to them that wrong ye, ye will find Your bliss or bale. This law came down from Heaven. Lo, ye behold Him there by whom it came; The Spirit was in Him, and for the sins Of man He suffered thus, and by His death Must all mankind be blest. Not knowing Him, Ye wander'd on in error; knowing now, And not obeying, what was error once Is guilt and wilful wrong. If ever more Ye bow to your false deities the knee; If ever more ye worship them with feast, Or sacrifice or dance; whoso offends Shall from among the people be cut off, Like a corrupted member, lest he taint The whole with death. With what appointed rites Your homage must be paid, ye shall be taught; Your children, in the way that they shall go, Be train'd from childhood up. Make ye meantime, Your prayer to that Beloved One, who sees The secrets of all hearts; and set ye up This, the memorial of his chosen Son, And Her, who, blessed among women, fed The Appointed at Her breast, and by His cross Endured intenser anguish; therefore sharing His glory now, with sunbeams robed, the Moon Her footstool, and a wreath of stars her crown. Hoamen, ye deem us children of a race Mightier than ye, and wiser, and by Heaven Beloved and favour'd more. From this pure law Hath all proceeded, . . wisdom, power, whate'er Here elevates the soul, and makes it ripe For higher powers and more exalted bliss. Share then our law, and be with us, on earth, Partakers of these blessings, and in Heaven, Co-heritors with us of endless joy. Ere yet one breath or motion had disturb'd The reverential hush, Erillyab rose. My people, said the Queen, their God is best And mightiest. Him to whom we offered up Blood of our blood and of our flesh the flesh, Vainly we deem'd divine; no spirit he Of good or evil, by the conquering arm Of Madoc mortal proved. What then remains But that the blessing proffer'd thus in love, In love we take? . . Deliverer, Teacher, Friend, First in the fellowship of faith I claim The initiatory rite. I also, cried The venerable Priest Ayayaca, Old as I am, I also, like a child, Would learn this wisdom yet before I die. The Elders rose and answer'd, We and all! And from the congregated tribe burst forth One universal shout, . . Great is the God Of Madoc, . . worthy to be served is He! Then to the mountain rivulet, which roll'd Like amber over its dark bed of rock, Did Madoc lead Erillyab, in the name Of Jesus, to his Christian family Accepted now. On her and on her son, The Elders and the People, Llorien Sprinkled the sanctifying waters. Day Was scarcely two hours old when he began His work, and when he ceased, the sun had past The heights of noon. Ye saw that blessed work, Sons of the Cymry, Cadog, Deiniol, Padarn, and Teilo! ye whose sainted names Your monumental temples still record; Thou, David, still revered, who in the vale, Where, by old Hatteril's wintry torrents swoln Rude Hodney rolls his raging stream, didst chuse Thy hermit home; and ye who by the sword Of the fierce Saxon, when the bloodier Monk Urged on the work of murder, for your faith And freedom fell, . . Martyrs and Saints, ye saw This triumph of the Cymry and the Cross, And struck your golden harps to hymns of joy. IX. TLALALA. As now the rites were ended, Caradoc Came from the ships, leading an Azteca Guarded and bound. Prince Madoc, said the Bard, Lo! the first captive of our arms I bring. Alone, beside the river I had stray'd, When from his lurking place, the savage hurl'd A javelin. At the rustle of the reeds, From whence the blow was aim'd, I turn'd in time, And heard it whizz beside me. Well it was, That from the ships they saw and succour'd me; For, subtle as a serpent in my grasp, He seemed all joint and flexure; nor had I Armour to ward, nor weapon to offend, To battle all unused and unprepared; But I too here upon this barbarous land, Like Elmur and like Aronan of old, Must lift the ruddy spear. This is no day For vengeance, answered Madoc, else his deed Had met no mercy. Freely let him go! Perchance the tidings of our triumph here May yet reclaim his country... Azteca, Go, let your Pabas know that we have crush'd Their complots here; beneath our righteous sword The Priest and his false Deity have fallen; The idols are consumed, and in their stead The emblems of our holy faith set up, Whereof the Hoamen have this day been made Partakers. Say to Aztlan, when she too Will make her temples clean, and put away Her foul abominations, and accept The Christian Cross, that Madoc then accords Forgiveness for the past, and peace to come. This better part let her, of her free will And wisdom chuse in time. Till Madoc spake, The captive reckless of his peril stood, Gazing with resolute and careless eye, As one in whom the lot of life or death Moved neither fear nor feeling; but that eye Now sparkling with defiance, . . Seek ye peace? He cried: O weak and woman-hearted man! Already wouldst thou lay the sword to rest? Not with the burial of the sword this strife Must end, for never doth the Tree of Peace Strike root and flourish, till the strong man's hand Upon his enemy's grave hath planted it. Come ye to Aztlan then in quest of peace? Ye feeble souls, if that be what ye seek Fly hence! our Aztlan suffers on her soil No living stranger. Do thy bidding, Chief! Calmly Cadwallon answered. To her choice Let Aztlan look, lest what she now reject In insolence of strength, she take upon her, In sorrow and in suffering and in shame, By strong compulsion, penitent too late. Thou hast beheld our ships with gallant men Freighted, a numerous force, . . and for our arms, . . Surely thy nation hath acquired of them Disastrous knowledge. Curse upon your arms! Exclaim'd the savage: . . Is there one among you Dare lay that cowardly advantage by, And meet me, man to man, in honest strife? That I might grapple with him, weaponless, On yonder rock, breast against breast, fair force Of limb and breath and blood, . . till one, or both, Dash'd down the shattering precipice, should feed The mountain eagle! . . Give me, I beseech you, That joy! As wisely, said Cynetha's son Thy foe might challenge thee, and bid thee let Thy strong right hand hang idle in the fray, That so his weakness with thy strength might cope In equal battle! . . Not in wrongful war, The tyrants of our weaker bretheren, Wield we these dreadful arms, . . but when assail'd By fraud and force, when call'd upon to aid The feeble and oppressed, shall we not Then put our terrors forth, and thunder-strike The guilty? Silently the Savage heard; Joy brighten'd in his eyes, as they unloosed His bonds; he stretch'd his arms at length, to feel His liberty, and like a greyhound then Slipt from the leash, he bounded o'er the hills. What was from early morning till noon day The steady travel of a well-girt man, He with fleet feet and unfatiguable, In three short hours hath traversed; in the lake He plunged, now shooting forth his pointed arms, Arrow-like darting on; recumbent now, Forces with springing feet his easier way; Then with new speed, as freshen'd by repose, Again he breasts the water. On the shore Of Aztlan now he stands, and breathes at will, And wrings his dripping locks; then through the gate Pursued his way. Green garlands deck the gate; Gay are the temples with green boughs affix'd; The door-posts and the lintels hung with wreaths: The fire of sacrifice, with flames bedimm'd, Burns in the sun-light, pale; the victims wait Around, impatient of their death delay'd. The Priest, before Tezcalipoca's shrine, Watches the maize-strewn threshold, to announce The footsteps of the God; for this the day, When to his favour'd city he vouchsafes His annual presence, and, with unseen feet, Imprints the maize-strewn threshold; follow'd soon By all whose altars with eternal fires Aztlan illumed, and fed with human blood; . . Mexitli, woman-born, who from the womb, Child of no mortal sire, leapt terrible, The arm'd avenger of his mother's fame; And he whose will the subject winds obey, Quetzalcoal; and Tlaloc, Water-God, And all the host of Deities, whose power Requites with bounty Aztlan's pious zeal, Health and rich increase giving to her sons, And withering in the war her enemies. So taught the Priests, and therefore were the gates Green-garlanded, the temples green with boughs, The door-posts and the lintels hung with wreaths; And yonder victims, ranged around the fire, Are destin'd, with the steam of sacrifice, To greet their dreadful coming With the train Of warrior Chiefs Coanacotzin stood, That when the Priest proclaim'd the enter'd God, His lips before the present Deity Might pour effectual prayer. The assembled Chiefs Saw Tlalala approach, more welcome now, As one whose absence from the appointed rites Had waken'd fear and wonder... Think not ye, The youth exclaim'd, careless impiety Could this day lead me wandering. I went forth To dip my javelin in the Strangers' blood, . . A sacrifice, methought, our Gods had loved To scent, and sooner hasten'd to enjoy. I fail'd, and fell a prisoner; but their fear Released me, . . coward fear, or childish hope, That, like Yuhidthiton, I might become Their friend, and merit chastisement from Heaven, Pleading the Strangers' cause. They bade me go And proffer peace... Chiefs, were it possible That tongue of mine could win you to that shame, Out would I pluck the member, though my soul Followed its bloody roots. The Stranger finds No peace in Aztlan, but the peace of death! 'Tis bravely said! Yuhidthiton replied, And fairly may'st thou boast, young Tlalala, For thou art brave in battle. Yet 'twere well If that same fearless tongue were taught to check Its boyish licence now. No law forbade Our friendship with the Stranger, when my voice Pleaded for proffered peace; that fault I shared In common with the King, and with the Chiefs, The Pabas and the People, none foreseeing Danger or guilt: but when at length the Gods Made evident their wrath in prodigies, I yielded to their manifested will My prompt obedience... Bravely hast thou said, And brave thou art, young Tyger of the War! But thou hast dealt with other enemies Than these impenetrable men, . . with foes, Whose conquered Gods lie idle in their chains, And with tame weakness brook captivity. When thou hast met the Strangers in the fight, And in the doings of that fight outdone Yuhidthiton, revile him then for one Slow to defend his country and his faith; Till then, with reverence, as beseems thy youth, Respect thou his full fame! I wrong it not! I wrong it not! cried the young Azteca; But truly, as I hope to equal it, Honour thy well-earn'd glory... But this peace! . . Renounce it! . . say that it shall never be! . Never, . . as long as there are Gods in Heaven, Or men in Aztlan! That, the King replied, The Gods themselves have answer'd. Never yet By holier ardour were our countrymen Possess'd; peace-offerings of repentance fill The temple courts; from every voice ascends The contrite prayer; daily the victim's heart, Sends its propitiatory steam to Heaven; And if the aid divine may be procured By the most dread solemnities of faith, And rigour of severest penitence, Soon shall the present influence strengthen us, And Aztlan be triumphant. While they spake, The ceaseless sound of song and instrument Rung through the air, now rising like the voice Of angry ocean, now subsiding soft, As when the breeze of evening dies away. The horn, and shrill-toned pipe, and drum, that gave Its music to the hand, and hollow'd wood, Drum-like, whose thunders, ever and anon, Commingling with the sea-shell's spiral roar, Closed the full harmony. And now the eve Past on, and, through the twilight visible, The frequent fire-flies' brightening beauties shone. Anxious and often now the Priest inspects The maize-strewn threshold; for the wonted hour Was come, and yet no footstep of the God! More radiant now the fire of sacrifice, Fed to full fury, blazed; and its red smoke Imparted to the darker atmosphere Such obscure light, as, o'er Vesuvio seen, Or pillared upon Etna's mountain-head, Makes darkness dreadful. In the captives' cheeks Then might a livid paleness have been seen, And wilder terror in their ghastly eyes, Expecting momently the pang of death. Soon in the multitude a doubt arose, Which none durst mention, lest his neighbour's fears, Divulged, should strengthen his; . . the hour was past, And yet no foot had mark'd the sprinkled maize! X. THE ARRIVAL OF THE GODS. Now every moment gave their doubts new force, And every wondering eye disclosed the fear Which on the tongue was trembling, when to the King, Emaciate like some bare anatomy, And deadly pale, Tezozomoc was led, By two supporting Priests. Ten painful months, Immured amid the forest had he dwelt, In abstinence and solitary prayer Passing his nights and days: thus did the Gods From their High Priest exact, when they enforced, By danger or distress, the penance due For public sins; and he had dwelt ten months, Praying and fasting and in solitude, Till now might every bone of his lean limbs Be told, and in his starved and boney face The living eye appeared unnatural, . . A ghostly sight. In breathless eagerness The multitude drew round as he began, . . O King, the Gods of Aztlan are not come; They will not come before the Strangers' blood Smoke on their altars: but they have beheld My days of prayer, and nights of watchfulness, And fasts austere, and bloody disciplines, And have reveal'd their pleasure. Who is here, Who to the White King's dwelling-place dare go, And execute their will? Scarce had he said, When Tlalala exclaim'd, I am the man. Hear then! Tezozomoc replied, . . Ye know That self-denial and long penance purge The film and foulness of mortality, For more immediate intercourse with Heaven Preparing the pure spirit; and all eyes May witness that with no relaxing zeal I have perform'd my duty. Much I fear'd For Aztlan's sins, and oft in bitterness, Have groan'd and bled for her iniquity; But chiefly for this solemn day the fear Was strong upon me, lest her Deities, Estranged should turn away, and we be left A spiritless and God-abandoned race, A warning to the earth. Ten weary months Have the raw maize and running water been My only food; but not a grain of maize Hath stay'd the gnawing appetite, nor drop Of water cool'd my parch'd and painful tongue, Since yester-morn arose. Fasting I pray'd And, praying, gash'd myself; and all night long, I watch'd and wept and supplicated Heaven, Till the weak flesh, its life-blood almost drain'd, Sunk with the long austerity: a dread Of death came over me; a deathy chill Ran through my veins, and loosen'd every limb; Dim grew mine eyes; and I could feel my heart Dying away within me, intermit Its slow and feeble throbs, then suddenly Start, as it seem'd exerting all its force In one last effort. On the ground I fell, I know not if entranced, or dead indeed, But without motion, hearing, sight, or sense, Feeling, or breath, or life. From that strange state, Even in such blessed freedom from all pain, That sure I thought myself in very Heaven, I woke, and raised my eyelids, and beheld A light which seemed to penetrate my bones With life and health. Before me, visible, Stood Coatlantona; a wreath of flowers Circled her hair, and from their odorous leaves Arose a lambent flame; not fitfully, Nor with faint flash or spark of earthly flowers; From these, for ever flowing forth, there play'd In one perpetual dance of pointed light, The azure radiance of innocuous fire. She spake... Hear, Aztlan! and give ear, O King! She said, Not yet the offended Gods relax Their anger; they require the Strangers' blood, The foretaste of their banquet. Let their will Be known to Aztlan, and the brave perform Their bidding; I, meantime, will seek to soothe, With all a mother's power, Mexitli's wrath. So let the Maidens daily with fresh flowers Garland my temple! . . Daily with fresh flowers Garland her temple, Aztlan! and revere The gentle mother of thy guardian God! And let the brave, exclaim'd young Tlalala, Perform her bidding! Servant of the Gods, Declare their will! . . Is it, that I should seek The Strangers, in the first who meets my way To plunge the holy weapon? Say thou to me Do this; . . and I depart to do the deed, Though my life-blood should mingle with the foe's. O brave young Chief! Tezozomoc replied, With better fortune may the grateful Gods Reward thy valour! deed so hazardous They ask not. Couldst thou from the mountain holds Tempt one of these rash foemen to pursue Thine artful flight, an ambush'd band might rise Upon the unsuspecting enemy, And intercept his way; then hitherward The captive should be led, and Aztlan's Gods On their own altars see the sacrifice, Well pleased, and Aztlan's sons, inspirited, Behold the omen of assured success. Thou know'st that Tlaloc's annual festival Is close at hand. A Stranger's child would prove A victim, whose rare value would deserve His certain favour. More I need not say. Chuse thou the force for ambush; and thyself Alone, or with a chosen comrade, seek The mountain dwellers. Instant as he ceased, Ocellopan began; I go with thee, O Tlalala! My friend! . . If one alone Could have the honour of this enterprize, My love might yield it thee; . . but thou wilt need A comrade... Tlalala, I go with thee! Whom, the Chief answer'd, should my heart select, Its tried companion else, but thee, so oft My brother in the battle? We will go, Shedder of blood! together will we go, Now, ere the midnight! Nay! the Priest replied, A little while delay; and ere ye go, Devote yourselves to Heaven! Feebly he spake, Like one exhausted; gathering then new force, As with laborious effort, he pursued, . . Bedew Mexitli's altar with your blood, And go beneath his guidage. I have yet Strength to officiate, and to bless your zeal. So saying, to the Temple of the God He led the way. The warriors follow'd him; And with his chiefs, Coanocotzin went, To grace with all solemnity the rite. They pass the Wall of Serpents, and ascend The massive fabric; four times they surround Its ample square, the fifth they reach the height. There, on the level top, two temple-towers Were rear'd; the one Tezcalipoca's fane, Supreme of Heaven, where now the wily Priest Stood, watchful for his presence, and observed The maize-strewn threshold. His the other pile, By whose peculiar power and patronage Aztlan was blest, Mexitli, woman-born. Before the entrance, the eternal fire Was burning; bare of foot they enter'd there. On a blue throne, with four huge silver snakes, As if the keepers of the sanctuary, Circled, with stretching neck and fangs display'd, Mexitli sate; another graven snake Belted with scales of gold his monster bulk. Around the neck a loathsome collar hung, Of human hearts; the face was mask'd with gold, His specular eyes seem'd fire; one hand uprear'd A club, the other, as in battle, held The shield; and over all suspended hung The banner of the nation. They beheld In awe, and knelt before the Terrible God. Guardian of Aztlan! cried Tezozomoc, Who to thy mortal mother hast assign'd The kingdom o'er all trees and arborets And herbs and flowers, giving her endless life, A Deity among the Deities; While Coatlantona implores thy love To thine own people, they in fear approach Thy aweful fane, who know no fear beside, And offer up the worthiest sacrifice, The blood of heroes! To the ready Chiefs He turn'd, and said, Now stretch your arms, and make The offering to the God. They their bare arms Stretched forth, and stabbed them with the aloe-point. Then in a golden vase, Tezozomoc Received the mingled streams, and held it up Toward the giant Idol, and exclaim'd, Terrible God! Protector of our realm! Receive thine incense! Let the steam of blood Ascend to thee, delightful! So mayest thou Still to thy chosen people lend thine aid; And these blaspheming strangers from the earth Be swept away; as erst the monster race Of Mammuth, Heaven's fierce ministers of wrath, Who drain'd the lakes in thirst, and for their food Exterminated nations. And as when, Their dreadful ministry of death fulfill'd, Ipalnemoani, by whom we live, Bade thee go forth, and with thy lightnings fill The vault of Heaven, and with thy thunders rock The rooted earth, till of the monster race Only their monumental bones remain'd, . . So arm thy favour'd people with thy might, Terrible God! and purify the land From these blaspheming foes! He said, and gave Ocellopan the vase... Chiefs, ye have pour'd Your strength and courage to the Terrible God, Devoted to his service; take ye now The beverage he hath hallow'd. In your youth Ye have quaff'd manly blood, that manly thoughts Might ripen in your hearts; so now with this, Which mingling from such noble veins hath flowed, Increase of valour drink, and added force. Ocellopan received the bloody vase, And drank, and gave in silence to his friend The consecrated draught; then Tlalala Drain'd off the offering. Braver blood than this My lips can never taste! quoth he; but soon Grant me, Mexitli, a more grateful cup, . . The Stranger's life! Are all the rites perform'd? Ocellopan enquired. Yea, all is done, Answer'd the Priest. Go! and the guardian God Of Aztlan be your guide! They left the fane. Lo! as Tezozomoc was passing by The eternal fire, the eternal fire shot up A long blue flame. He started; he exclaim'd, The God! the God! Tezcalipoca's Priest Echoed the welcome cry, The God! the God! For lo! his footsteps mark the maize-strewn floor A mighty shout from all the multitudes Of Aztlan rose; they cast into the fire The victims, whose last shrieks of agony Mingled unheeded with the cries of joy. Then louder from the spiral sea-shell's depth Swell'd the full roar, and from the hollow wood Peal'd deeper thunders. Round the choral band, The circling nobles, gay with gorgeous plumes, And gems which sparkled to the midnight fire, Moved in the solemn dance; each in his hand, In measured movements lifts the feathery shield, And shakes a rattling ball to measured sounds. With quicker steps, the inferior chiefs without, Equal in number, but in just array, The spreading radii of the mystic wheel, Revolve; and, outermost, the youths roll round, In motions rapid as their quicken'd blood. So thus with song and harmony the night Past on in Aztlan, and all hearts rejoiced. XI. THE CAPTURE. Meantime from Aztlan, on their enterprize, Shedder of Blood and Tyger of the War, Ocellopan and Tlalala set forth. With chosen followers, through the silent night, Silent they travell'd on. After a way Circuitous and far through lonely tracks, They reach'd the mountains, and amid the shade Of thickets covering the uncultured slope, Their patient ambush placed. The chiefs alone Held on, till winding in ascent they reach'd The heights which o'er the Briton's mountain hold Impended; there they stood, and by the moon Who yet, with undiminished lustre, hung High in the dark blue firmament, from thence Explored the steep descent. Precipitous The rock beneath them lay, a sudden cliff Bare and unbroken; in its midway holes, Where never hand could reach, nor eye intrude, The eagle built her eyrie. Farther on, Its interrupted crags and ancient woods Offered a difficult way. From crag to crag, By rocky shelf, by trunk, or root, or bough, A painful toil and perilous, they past; And now, stretch'd out amid the matted shrubs, Which, at the entrance of the valley, clothed The rugged bank, they crouch'd. By this the stars Grew dim; the glow-worm hath put out her lamp; The owls have ceased their night-song. On the top Of yon magnolia the loud turkey's voice Is heralding the dawn; from tree to tree Extends the wakening watch-note, far and wide, Till the whole woodlands echo with the cry. Now breaks the morning; but as yet no foot Hath mark'd the dews, nor sound of man is heard. Then first Ocellopan beheld, where near, Beneath the shelter of a half-roof'd hut, A sleeping stranger lay. He pointed him To Tlalala. The Tyger look'd around: None else was nigh... Shall I descend, he said, And strike him? here is none to see the deed. We offered to the Gods our mingled blood Last night; and now, I deem it, they present An offering which shall more propitiate them, And omen sure success. I will go down And kill! He said, and, gliding like a snake, Where Caradoc lay sleeping made his way. Sweetly slept he, and pleasant were his dreams Of Britain, and the blue-eyed maid he loved. The Azteca stood over him; he knew His victim, and the power of vengeance gave Malignant joy. Once hast thou 'scaped my arm: But what shall save thee now? the Tyger thought, Exulting; and he raised his spear to strike. That instant, o'er the Briton's unseen harp The gale of morning past, and swept its strings Into so sweet a harmony, that sure It seem'd no earthly tone. The savage man Suspends his stroke; he looks astonish'd round; No human hand is near: . . and hark! again The aërial music swells and dies away. Then first the heart of Tlalala felt fear: He thought that some protecting spirit watch'd Beside the Stranger, and abash'd, withdrew. A God protects him! to Ocellopan, Whispering, he said. Didst thou not hear the sound Which enter'd into me, and fix'd my arm Powerless above him? Was it not a voice From thine own Gods to strengthen thee, replied His sterner comrade, and make evident Their pleasure in the deed? Nay! Tlalala Rejoin'd; they speak in darkness and in storms: The thunder is their voice, that peals through heaven, Or rolling underneath us, makes earth rock In tempest, and destroys the sons of men. It was no sound of theirs, Ocellopan! No voice to hearten, . . for I felt it pass Unmanning every limb; yea, it relax'd The sinews of my soul. Shedder of Blood, I cannot lift my hand against the man. Go, if thy heart be stronger! But meantime Young Caradoc arose, of his escape Unconscious; and by this the stirring sounds Of day began, increasing now, as all Now to their toil betake them. Some go fell The stately tree; some from the trunk low-laid Hew the huge boughs; here round the fire they char The stake-points; here they level with a line The ground-plot, and infix the ready piles, Or, interknitting them with osiers, weave The wicker wall; others along the lake, From its shoal waters gather reeds and canes, . . Light roofing, suited to the genial sky. The woodman's measured stroke, the regular saw, The wain slow-creaking, and the voice of man Answering his fellow, or in single toil, Cheering his labour with a cheerful song, Strange concert made to those fierce Aztecas, Who, beast-like, in their silent lurking place Couch'd close and still, observant for their prey. All overseeing, and directing all, From place to place moved Madoc, and beheld The dwellings rise. Young Hoel at his side Ran on, best pleased when at his Uncle's side Courting indulgent love. And now they came Beside the half-roof'd hut of Caradoc; Of all the mountain-dwellings that the last. The little boy, in boyish wantonness, Would quit his Uncle's hold, and haste away, With childhood's frolic speed, then laugh aloud, To tempt pursuit, now running to the huts, Now toward the entrance of the valley straits. But wheresoe'er he turned, Ocellopan With hunter's-eye pursued his heedless course, In breath-suspending vigilance. Ah me! The little wretch toward his lurking-place Draws near, and calls on Madoc; and the Prince Thinks of no danger nigh, and follows not The childish lure! nearer the covert now Young Hoel runs, and stops, and calls again; Then like a lion, from his couching place Ocellopan leapt forth, and seized his prey. Loud shriek'd the affrighted child, as in his arms The savage grasp'd him; startled at the cry, Madoc beheld him hastening through the pass. Quick as instinctive love can urge his feet He follows, and he now almost hath reach'd The incumber'd ravisher, and hope inspires New speed, . . yet nearer now, and nearer still, And lo! the child holds out his little arms! That instant, as the Prince almost had laid His hand upon the boy, young Tlalala Leapt on his neck, and soon, though Madoc's strength, With frantic fury, shook him from his hold, Far down the steep Ocellopan had fled. Ah! what avails it now, that they, by whom Madoc was standing to survey their toil, Have miss'd their Chief, and spread the quick alarm? What now avails it, that with distant aid, His gallant men come down? Regarding nought But Hole, but the wretched Llaian's grief, He rushes on; and ever as he draws Near to the child, the Tyger Tlalala Impedes his way; and now they reach the place Of ambush, and the ambush'd band arise, And Madoc is their prisoner. Caradoc, In vain thou leadest on the late pursuit! In vain, Cadwallon, hath thy love alarm'd Caught the first sound of evil! They pour out Tumultuous from the vale, a half-arm'd troop; Each with such weapons as his hasty hand Can seize, they rush to battle. Gallant men, Your valour boots not! It avails not now, With such fierce onset that ye charge the foe, And drive with such full force the weapon home! They while ye slaughter them, impede pursuit, And far away, meantime, their comrades bear The captive Prince. In vain his noble heart Swells now with wild and suffocating rage; In vain he struggles: . . they have bound his limbs With the tough osier, and his struggles now But bind more close and cuttingly the band. They hasten on; and while they bear the prize, Leaving their ill-doomed fellows in the fight To check pursuit, foremost afar of all, With unabating strength by joy inspired, Ocellopan to Aztlan bears the child. XII. HOEL. Good tidings travel fast... The chief is seen; He hastens on; he holds the child on high; He shouts aloud. Through Aztlan spreads the news; Each to his neighbour tells the happy tale, . . Joy, . . joy to Aztlan! the blood-shedder comes! Tlaloc has given his victim. Ah, poor child! They from the gate swarm out to welcome thee, Warriors, and men grown grey, and youths and maids, Exulting, forth they crowd. The mothers throng To view thee, and, while thinking of thy doom, They clasp their own dear infants to the breast With deeper love, delighted think that thou Shalt suffer for them. He, poor child, admires The strange array! with wonder he beholds Their olive limbs, half bare, their plumey crowns, And gazes round and round, where all was new, Forgetful of his fears. But when the Priest Approach'd to take him from the Warrior's arms, Then Hoel scream'd, and from that hideous man Averting, to Ocellopan he turn'd, And would have clung to him, so dreadful late, Stern as he was, and terrible of eye, Less dreadful than the Priest, whose dark aspect Which nature with her harshest characters Had featured, art made worse. His cowl was white; His untrimm'd hair, a long and loathsome mass, With cotton cords intwisted, clung with gum, And matted with the blood, which every morn, He from his temples drew before the God, In sacrifice; bare were his arms, and smear'd Black. But his countenance a stronger dread Than all the horrors of that outward garb, Struck with quick instinct to young Hoel's heart; It was a face, whose settled sullenness No gentle feeling ever had disturb'd; Which, when he probed a victim's living breast, Retained its hard composure. Such was he Who took the son of Llaian, heeding not His cries and screams, and arms in suppliant guise, Stretch'd out to all around, and strugglings vain. He to the Temple of the Water-God Convey'd his victim. By the threshold, there The ministering Virgins stood, a comely band Of high-born damsels, to the temple rites By pious parents vow'd. Gladly to them The little Hoel leapt; their gentle looks No fear excited; and he gazed around, Pleased and surprised, unconscious to what end These things were tending. O'er the rush-strewnfloor They to the azure Idol led the boy, Now not reluctant, and they raised the hymn. God of the Waters! at whose will the streams Flow in their wonted channel, and diffuse Their plenty round, the blood and life of earth; At whose command they swell, and o'er their banks Burst with resistless ruin, making vain The toils and hopes of man, . . behold this child! O strong to bless, and mighty to destroy, Tlaloc! behold thy victim! so mayest thou Restrain the peaceful streams within their banks, And bless the labours of the husbandman. God of the Mountains! at whose will the clouds Cluster around the heights; who sendest them To shed their fertilizing showers, and raise The drooping herb, and o'er the thirsty vale Spread their green freshness; at whose voice the hills Grow black with storms; whose wrath the thunder speaks, Whose bow of anger shoots the lightning shafts, To blast the works of man; . . behold this child! O strong to bless, and mighty to destroy, Tlaloc! behold thy victim! so mayest thou Lay by the fiery arrows of thy rage, And bid the genial rains and dews descend. O thou, Companion of the powerful God, Companion and Beloved! . . when he treads The mountain-top, whose breath diffuses round The sweets of summer; when he rides the waves, Whose presence is the sunshine and the calm, . . Aiauh, O green-robed Goddess, see this child! Behold thy victim! so mayest thou appease The sterner mind of Tlaloc when he frowns, And Aztlan flourish in thy fostering smile. Young Spirits! ye whom Aztlan's piety Hath given to Tlaloc, to enjoy with him, For aye, the cool delights of Tlalocan, . . Young Spirits of the happy; who have left Your Heaven to-day, unseen assistants here, . . Behold your comrade! see the chosen child, Who through the lonely cave of death must pass, Like you, to join you in eternal joy. Now from the rush-strewn temple they depart. They place their smiling victim in a car, Upon whose sides of pearly shell there play'd, Shading and shifting still, the rainbow light. On virgin shoulders is he borne aloft, With dance before, and song and music round; And thus they seek, in festival array, The water-side. There lies the sacred bark, All gay with gold, and garlanded with flowers: The virgins with the joyous boy embark; Ten boatmen urge them on; the Priests behind Follow, and all the long solemnity. The lake is overspread with boats; the sun Shines on the gilded prows, the feathery crowns, The sparkling waves. Green islets float along, Where high-born damsels, under jasmin bowers, Raise the sweet voice, to which the echoing oars, In modulated motion, rise and fall. The moving multitude along the shore Flows like a stream; bright shines the unclouded sky; Heaven, earth, and waters wear one face of joy. Young Hoel with delight beholds the pomp; His heart throbs joyfully; and if he thinks Upon his mother now, 'tis but to think How beautiful a tale for her glad ear He hath when he returns. Meantime the maids Weave garlands for his head, and raise the song. Oh! happy thou, whom early from the world The Gods require! not by the wasting worm Of sorrow canker'd, nor condemn'd to feel The pang of sickness, nor the wound of war, Nor the long miseries of protracted age; But thus in childhood chosen of the God, To share his joys. Soon shall thy rescued soul, Child of the Stranger! in his blissful world, Mix with the blessed spirits; for not thine, Amid the central darkness of the earth, To endure the eternal void; . . not thine to live, Dead to all objects of eye, ear, or sense, In the long horrors of one endless night, With endless being curst. For thee the bowers Of Tlalocan have blossom'd with new sweets; For thee have its immortal trees matured The fruits of Heaven; thy comrades even now Wait thee, impatient, in their fields of bliss; The God will welcome thee, his chosen child, And Aiauh love thee with a mother's love. Child of the Stranger, dreary is thy way! Darkness and Famine through the cave of Death Must guide thee. Happy thou, when on that night The morning of the eternal day shall dawn. So as they sung young Hoel's song of death, With rapid strength the boatmen plied their oars, And through the water swift they glided on, And now to shore they drew. The stately bank Rose with the majesty of woods o'erhung, And rocks, or peering through the forest shade, Or rising from the lake, and with their bulk Glassing its dark deep waters. Half way up, A cavern pierced the rock; no human foot Had trod its depths, nor ever sunbeam reach'd Its long recesses and mysterious gloom; To Tlaloc it was hallowed; and the stone, Which closed its entrance, never was removed, Save when the yearly festival return'd, And in its womb a child was sepulchred, The living victim. Up the winding path, That to the entrance of the cavern led, With many a painful step the train ascend: But many a time, upon that long ascent, Young Hoel would have paused, with weariness Exhausted now. They urge him on, . . poor child! They urge him on! . . Where is Cadwallon's aid? Where is the sword of Ririd? where the arm Of Madoc now? . . Oh! better had he lived, Unknowing and unknown, on Arvon's plain, And trod upon his noble father's grave, With peasant feet, unconscious! . . They have reach'd The cavern now, and from its mouth the Priests Roll the huge portal. Thitherward they force The son of Llaian. A cold air comes out; . . It chills him, and his feet recoil; . . in vain His feet recoil; . . in vain he turns to fly, Affrighted at the sudden gloom that spreads Around; . . the den is closed, and he is left In solitude and darkness, . . left to die! XIII. COATEL. That morn from Aztlan Coatel had gone, In search of flowers, amid the woods and crags, To deck the shrine of Coatlantona; Such flowers as in the solitary wilds Hiding their modest beauty, made their worth More valued for its rareness. 'Twas to her A grateful task; not only for she fled Those cruel rites, to which nor reverent use, Nor frequent custom could familiarize Her gentle heart, and teach it to put off All womanly feeling; . . but that from all eyes Escaped, and all obtrusive fellowship, She in that solitude might send her soul To where Lincoya with the Strangers dwelt. She from the summit of the woodland heights Gazed on the lake below. The sound of song And instrument, in soften'd harmony, Had reach'd her where she stray'd; and she beheld The pomp, and listen'd to the floating sounds, A moment, with delight: but then a fear Came on her, for she knew with what design The Tyger and Ocellopan had sought The dwellings of the Cymry... Now the boats Drew nearer, and she knew the Stranger's child. She watch'd them land below; she saw them wind The ascent: . . and now from that abhorred cave The stone is roll'd away, . . and now the child From light and life is cavern'd. Coatel Thought of his mother then, of all the ills Her fear would augur, and how worse than all Which even a mother's maddening fear could feign, His actual fate. She thought of this, and bow'd Her face upon her knees, and closed her eyes, Shuddering. Suddenly in the brake beside, A rustling startled her, and from the shrubs, A Vulture rose. She moved toward the spot, Led by an idle impulse, as it seem'd, To see from whence the carrion bird had fled. The bushes overhung a narrow chasm Which pierced the hill: upon its mossy sides Shade-loving herbs and flowers luxuriant grew, And jutting crags made easy the descent. A little way descending, Coatel Stoopt for the flowers, and heard, or thought she heard, A feeble sound below. She raised her head, And anxiously she listen'd for the sound, Not without fear... Feebly again, and like A distant cry, it came; and then she thought, Perhaps it was the voice of that poor child, By the slow pain of hunger doom'd to die. She shudder'd at the thought, and breathed a groan Of unavailing pity; . . but the sound Came nearer, and her trembling heart conceived A dangerous hope. The Vulture from that chasm Had fled, perchance accustomed in the cave To seek his banquet, and by living feet Alarm'd: . . there was an entrance then below; And were it possible that she could save The Stranger's child, . . Oh what a joy it were To tell Lincoya that! It was a thought Which made her heart with terror and delight Throb audibly. From crag to crag she past Descending, and beheld a narrow cave Enter the hill. A little way the light Fell, . . but its feeble glimmering she herself Obstructed half, as stooping in she went. The arch grew loftier, and the increasing gloom Fill'd her with more affright; and now she paused; For at a sudden and abrupt descent She stood, and fear'd its unseen depth; her heart Fail'd, and she back had hasten'd; but the cry Reach'd her again, the near and certain cry Of that most pitiable innocent. Again adown the dark descent she look'd, Straining her eyes; by this the strengthen'd sight Had grown adapted to the gloom around, And her dilated pupils now received Dim sense of objects near. Something below, White in the darkness lay, it mark'd the depth, Still Coatel stood dubious; but she heard The wailing of the child, and his loud sobs; . . Then, clinging to the rock with fearful hands, Her feet explored below, and twice she felt Firm footing, ere her fearful hold relax'd. The sound she made, along the hollow rock Ran echoing. Hoel heard it, and he came Groping along the side. A dim, dim light Broke on the darkness of his sepulchre; A human form drew near him; . . he sprang on, Screaming with joy, and clung to Coatel, And cried, O take me from this dismal place! She answer'd not; she understood him not; But clasp'd the little victim to her breast, And shed delightful tears. But from that den Of darkness and of horror, Coatel Durst not convey the child, though in her heart There was a female tenderness which yearn'd, As with maternal love, to cherish him. She hush'd his clamours, fearful lest the sound Might reach some other ear; she kiss'd away The tears that stream'd adown his little cheeks; She gave him food which in the morn she brought, For her own wants, from Aztlan. Some few words Of Britain's ancient language she had learnt From her Lincoya, in those happy days Of peace, when Aztlan was the Stranger's friend: Aptly she learnt, what willingly he taught, Terms of endearment, and the parting words Which promised quick return. She to the child These precious words address'd; and if it chanced Imperfect knowledge, or some difficult sound Check'd her heart's utterance, then the gentle tone, The fond caress, intelligibly spake Affection's language. But when she arose, And would have climb'd the ascent, the affrighted boy Fast held her, and his tears interpreted The prayer to leave him not. Again she kiss'd His tears away; again of soon return Assured and soothed him; till reluctantly And weeping, but in silence, he unloosed His grasp; and up the difficult ascent Coatel climb'd, and to the light of day Returning, with her flowers she hastened home. XIV. THE STONE OF SACRIFICE. Who comes to Aztlan, bounding like a deer Along the plain? . . The herald of success; For lo! his locks are braided, and his loins Cinctured with white; and see, he lifts the shield, And brandishes the sword. The populace Flock round, impatient for the tale of joy, And follow to the palace in his path. Joy! joy! the Tyger hath achieved his quest! They bring a captive home! . . Triumphantly Coanocotzin and his Chiefs go forth To greet the youth triumphant, and receive The victim whom the gracious gods have given, Sure omen and first fruits of victory. A woman leads the train, young, beautiful, . . More beautiful for that translucent joy Flushing her cheek, and sparkling in her eye; . . Her hair is twined with festal flowers, her robe With flowing wreaths adorn'd; she holds a child, He, too, bedeck'd and garlanded with flowers, And, lifting him, with agile force of arm, In graceful action, to harmonious step Accordant, leads the dance. It is the wife Of Tlalala, who, with his child, goes forth To meet her hero husband. And behold The Tyger comes! and ere the shouts and sounds Of gratulation cease, his followers bear The captive Prince. At that so welcome sight Loud rose the glad acclaim; nor knew they yet That he who there lay patient in his bonds, Expecting the inevitable lot, Was Madoc. Patient in his bonds he lay, Exhausted with vain efforts, hopeless now, And silently resign'd. But when the King Approach'd the prisoner, and beheld his face, And knew the Chief of Strangers, at that sound Electric joy shot through the multitude, And, like the raging of the hurricane, Their thundering transports peal'd. A deeper joy, A nobler triumph kindled Tlalala, As, limb by limb, his eye survey'd the Prince, With a calm fierceness. And by this the Priests Approach'd their victim, clad in vestments white Of sacrifice, which from the shoulders fell, As from the breast, unbending, broad and straight, Leaving their black arms bare. The blood-red robe, The turquoise pendant from his down-drawn lip, The crown of glossy plumage, whose green hue Vied with his emerald ear-drops, mark'd their Chief Tezozomoc: his thin and ghastly cheek, Which, . . save the temple serpents, when he brought Their human banquet, . . never living eye Rejoiced to see, became more ghastly now, As in Mexitli's name, upon the Prince He laid his murtherous hand. But as he spake, Up darted Tlalala his eagle glance... Away! away! he shall not perish so! The warrior cried... Not tamely, by the knife, Nor on the jaspar-stone, his blood shall flow! The Gods of Aztlan love a Warrior Priest! I am their Priest to-day! A murmuring Ran through the train; nor waited he to hear Denial thence; but on the multitude Aloud he call'd... When first our fathers seized This land, there was a savage chief who stopt Their progress. He had gained the rank he bore, By long probation: stripes, which laid his flesh All bleeding bare, had forced not one complaint; Not when the working bowels might be seen, One movement; hand-bound, he had been confined Where myriad insects on his nakedness Infix'd their venomous anger, and no start, No shudder, shook his frame: last, in a net Suspended, he had felt the agony Of fire, which to his bones and marrow pierced, And breathed the suffocating smoke which fill'd His lungs with fire, without a groan, a breath, A look betokening sense; so gallantly Had he subdued his nature. This brave man Met Aztlan in the war, and put her Chiefs To shame. Our Elders have not yet forgot How from the slaughtered brother of their King He stript the skin, and formed of it a drum, Whose sound affrighted armies. With this man My father coped in battle; here he led him, An offering to the God; and man to man, He slew him here in fight. I was a child, Just old enough to lift my father's shield; But I remember, on that glorious day, When from the sacred combat he return'd, His red hands reeking with the hot heart's blood, How in his arms he took me, and besought The God whom he had served, to bless his boy, And make me like my father. Men of Aztlan Mexitli heard his prayer; . . Here I have brought The Stranger-Chief, the noblest sacrifice That ever graced the altar of the God; Let then his death be noble! so my boy Shall, in the day of battle, think of me; And as I follow'd my brave father's steps, Pursue my path of glory. Ere the Priest Could frame denial, had the Monarch's look Given his assent... Refuse not this, he said, O servant of the Gods! He hath not here His arms to save him; and the Tyger's strength Yields to no mortal might. Then for his sword He call'd, and bade Yuhidthiton address The Stranger-Chief. Yuhidthiton began, The Gods of Aztlan triumph, and thy blood Must wet their altars. Prince, thou shalt not die The coward's death; but, sworded, and in fight, Fall as becomes the valiant. Should thine arm Subdue in battle six successive foes, Life, liberty, and glory, will repay The noble conquest. Madoc, hope not this! Strong are the brave of Aztlan! Then they loosed The Ocean Chieftain's bonds; they rent away His garments; and with songs and shouts of joy, They led him to the Stone of Sacrifice. Round was that Stone of blood; the half-raised arm Of one of manly growth, who stood below, Might rest upon its height; the circle small, An active boy might almost bound across. Nor needed for the combat, ampler space; For in the centre was the prisoner's foot Fast fetter'd down. Thus fetter'd Madoc stood. He held a buckler, light and small, of cane O'erlaid with beaten gold; his sword, the King, Honouring a noble enemy, had given, A weapon tried in war, . . to Madoc's grasp Strange and unwieldy: 'twas a broad strong staff, Set thick with transverse stones, on either side Keen-edged as Syrian steel. But when he felt The weapon, Madoc call'd to mind his deeds Done on the Saxon in his fathers' land And hope arose within him. Nor though now Naked he stood, did fear for that assail His steady heart; for often had he seen His gallant countrymen with naked breasts, Rush on their iron-coated enemy, And win the conquest. Now hath Tlalala Array'd himself for battle. First he donn'd A gipion, quilted close of gossampine; O'er that a jointed mail of plates of gold, Bespotted like the tyger's speckled pride, To speak his rank; it clad his arms half-way, Half-way his thighs; but cuishes had he none, Nor gauntlets, nor feet-armour. On his helm There yawn'd the semblance of a tyger's head, The long white teeth extended, as for prey; Proud crest, to blazon his proud title forth. And now toward the fatal stage equipp'd For fight, he went; when, from the press behind, A warrior's voice was heard, and clad in arms, And shaking in his angry grasp the sword, Ocellopan rush'd on, and cried aloud, And for himself the holy combat claim'd. The Tyger, heedless of his clamour, sprung Upon the stone, and turn'd him to the war. Fierce leaping forward came Ocellopan, And bounded up the ascent, and seized his arm: . . Why wouldst thou rob me of a deed like this? Equal our peril in the enterprise, Equal our merit; . . thou wouldst reap alone The guerdon! Never shall my children lift Their little hands at thee, and say, Lo! there The Chief who slew the White King! . . Tlalala, Trust to the lot, or turn on me, and prove, By the best chance to which the brave appeal, Who best deserves this glory! Stung to wrath, The Tyger answer'd not; he raised his sword, And they had rushed to battle; but the Priests Came hastening up, and by their common Gods, And by their common country, bade them cease Their impious strife, and let the lot decide From whom Mexitli should that day receive His noble victim. Both unsatisfied, But both obedient, heard. Two equal shafts, As outwardly they seem'd, the Paba brought; His mantle hid their points; and Tlalala Drew forth the broken stave. A bitter smile Darken'd his cheek, as angrily he cast To earth the hostile lot... Shedder of Blood, Thine is the first adventure! he exclaim'd; But thou mayest perish here! . . and in his heart The Tyger hoped Ocellopan might fall, As sullenly retiring from the stage, He mingled with the crowd. And now opposed In battle, on the Stone of Sacrifice, Prince Madoc and the Life-Destroyer stood. This clad in arms complete, free to advance In quick assault, or shun the threaten'd blow, Wielding his wonted sword; the other, stript, Save of that fragile shield, of all defence; His weapon strange and cumbrous; and pinn'd down, Disabled from all onset, all retreat. With looks of greedy joy, Ocellopan Survey'd his foe, and wonder'd to behold The breast so broad, the bare and brawny limbs, Of matchless strength. The eye of Madoc, too, Dwelt on his foe; his countenance was calm, Something more pale than wonted; like a man Prepared to meet his death. The Azteca Fiercely began the fight; now here, now there Aright, aleft, above, below, he wheel'd The rapid sword: still Madoc's rapid eye Pursued the motion, and his ready shield, In prompt interposition, caught the blow, Or turn'd its edge aside. Nor did the Prince Yet aim the sword to wound, but held it forth, Another shield, to save him, till his hand, Familiar with its weight and shape uncouth, Might wield it well to vengeance. Thus he stood, Baffling the impatient enemy, who now Wax'd wrathful, thus to waste in idle strokes Reiterate so oft, his bootless strength. And now yet more exasperate he grew; For, from the eager multitude, was heard, Amid the din of undistinguish'd sounds, The Tyger's murmur'd name, as though they thought, Had he been on the Stone, ere this, besure, The Gods had tasted of their sacrifice, Now all too long delayed. Then fiercelier, And yet more rapidly, he drove the sword; But still the wary Prince or met its fall, And broke the force, or bent him from the blow; And now retiring, and advancing now, As one free foot permitted, still provoked, And baffled still the savage; and sometimes, With cautious strength did Madoc aim attack, Mastering each moment now with abler sway The acquainted sword. But, though as yet unharm'd In life or limb, more perilous the strife Grew momently; for with repeated strokes, Battered and broken now, the shield hung loose; And shouts of triumph from the multitude Arose, as piece-meal they beheld it fall, And saw the Prince exposed. That welcome sight Those welcome sounds, inspired Ocellopan; He felt each limb new-strung. Impatient now Of conquest long delay'd, with wilder rage He drives the weapon; Madoc's lifted sword Received its edge, and shiver'd with the blow. A shriek of transport burst from all around; For lo! the White King, shieldless, weaponless, Naked before his foe! That savage foe, Dallying with the delight of victory, Drew back a moment to enjoy the sight, Then yell'd in triumph, and sprang on to give The consummating blow. Madoc beheld The coming death; he darted up his hand Instinctively to save, and caught the wrist In its mid fall, and drove with desperate force The splintered truncheon of his broken sword Full in the enemy's face. Beneath his eye It broke its way, and where the nasal nerves Branch in fine fibrils o'er their mazy seat, Burst through, and slanting upward in the brain Buried its jagged point. Madoc himself Stood at his fall astonished, at escape Unhoped, and strange success. The multitude Beheld, and they were silent, and they stood Gazing in terror. But far other thoughts Rose in the Tyger's heart; it was a joy To Tlalala; and forth he sprung, and up The Stone of Sacrifice, and call'd aloud To bring the Prince another sword and shield, For his last strife. Then in that interval, Upon Ocellopan he fixed his eyes, Contemplating the dead, as though thereby To kindle in his heart a fiercer thirst For vengeance. Nor to Madoc was the sting Of anger wanting, when in Tlalala He knew the captive whom his mercy freed, The man whose ambush had that day destroyed, Young Hoel and himself; . . for, sure, he deem'd Young Hoel was with God, and he himself At his death day arrived. And now he graspt A second sword, and held another shield; And from the Stone of Blood Ocellopan Was borne away; and, fresh in arms, and fierce With all that makes a savage thirst for war, Hope, vengeance, courage, superstitious hate, A second foe came on. By this the Prince Could wield his weapon well; and dreading now Lest in protracted combat, he might stand Again defenceless, he put forth his strength, As oft assailing as assailed, and watch'd So well the Tyger's motions, and received The Tyger's blows so warily, and aimed His own so fierce and fast, that in the crowd Doubt and alarm prevailed. Ilanquel grew Pale at her husband's danger; and she clasp'd The infant to her breast, whom late she held On high, to see his victory. The throng Of the beholders silently look'd on; And in their silence might at times be heard An indrawn breath of terror; and the Priests Angrily murmured, that in evil hour, Coanocotzin had indulged the pride Of vaunting valour, and from certain death Reprieved the foe. But now a murmur rose Amid the multitude; and they who stood So thickly throng'd, and with such eager eyes Late watch'd the fight, hastily now broke up, And with disorder'd speed and sudden arms, Ran to the city gates. More eager now, Conscious of what had chanced, fought Tlalala; And hope invigorated Madoc's heart; For well he ween'd Cadwallon was at hand, Leading his gallant friends. Aright he ween'd; At hand Cadwallon was! His gallant friends Came from the mountains with impetuous speed, To save or to revenge. Nor long endured The combat now: the Priests ascend the stone, And bid the Tyger hasten to defend His country and his Gods; and, hand and foot, Binding the captive Prince, they bear him thence And lay him in the temple. Then his heart Resign'd itself to death, and Madoc thought Of Llaian and Goervyl: and he felt That death was dreadful. But not so the King Permitted; but not so had Heaven decreed; For noble was the King of Aztlan's heart, And pure his tongue from falsehood: he had said, That by the warrior's death should Madoc die; Nor dared the Pabas violently break The irrevocable word. There Madoc lay In solitude; the distant battle reach'd His ear; inactive and in bonds he lay, Expecting the dread issue, and almost Wish'd for the perils of the fight again. XV. THE BATTLE. Not unprepared Cadwallon found the sons Of Aztlan, nor defenceless were her walls; But when the Britons' distant march was seen, A ready army issued from her gates, And dight themselves to battle: these the King Coanocotzin had, with timely care, And provident for danger, thus arrayed. Forth issuing from the gates, they met the foe, And with the sound of sonorous instruments, And with their shouts and screams and yells, droveback The Britons' fainter war-cry, as the swell Of ocean, flowing onward, up its course Repels the river-stream. Their darts and stones Fell like the rain drops of the summer-shower, So fast, and on the helmet and the shield, On the strong corselet and the netted mail, So innocent they fell. But not in vain The bowmen of Deheubarth sent, that day, Their iron bolts abroad; those volant deaths Descended on the naked multitude, And through the chieftain's quilted gossampine, Through feathery breastplate and effulgent gold, They reach'd the life. But soon no interval For archer's art was left, nor scope for flight Of stone from whirling sling: both hosts, alike Impatient for the proof of war, press on; The Aztecas, to shun the arrowy storm, The Cymry, to release their Lord, or heap Aztlan in ruins, for his monument. Spear against spear, and shield to shield, and breast To breast they met; equal in force of limb And strength of heart, in resolute resolve, And stubborn effort of determined wrath: The few, advantaged by their iron mail; The weaklier arm'd, of near retreat assured And succour close at hand, in tenfold troops Their foemen overnumbering. And of all That mighty multitude, did every man Of either host, alike inspired by all That stings to will and strengthens to perform, Then put forth all his power; for well they knew Aztlan that day must triumph or must fall. Then sword and mace on helm and buckler rang, And hurtling javelins whirr'd along the sky. Nor when they hurled the javelin, did the sons Of Aztlan, prodigal of weapons, loose The lance, to serve them for no second stroke; A line of ample measure still retain'd The missile shaft; and when its blow was spent, Swiftly the dextrous spearman coiled the string, And sped again the artificer of death. Rattling, like summer hailstones, they descend, But from the Britons' iron panoply, Baffled and blunted, fell; nor more avail'd The stony falchion there, whose broken edge Inflicts no second wound; nor profited, On the strong buckler or the crested helm, The knotty club; though fast, in blinding showers, Those javelins fly, those heavy weapons fall With stunning weight. Meantime, with wonted strength, The men of Gwyneth through their fenceless foes Those lances thrust, whose terrors had so oft Affrayed the Saxons, and whose home-driven points, So oft had pierced the Normen's knightly arms. Little did then his pomp of plumes bestead The Azteca, or glittering pride of gold, Against the tempered sword; little his casque, Gay with its feathery coronal, or drest In graven terrors, when the Britons' hand Drove in through helm and head the short-piked mace: Or swung its iron weights with shattering sway, Which where they struck, destroyed. Beneath those arms The men of Aztlan fell; and whoso dropt Dead or disabled, him his comrades bore Away with instant caution, lest the sight Of those whom they had slaughtered might inspire The foe with hope and courage. Fast they fell, And fast were resupplied, man after man Succeeding to the death. Nor in the town Did now the sight of their slain countrymen, Momentarily carried in and piled in heaps, Awake one thought of fear. Hark! through the streets Of Aztlan, how from house to house, and tower To tower, reiterate, Paynalton's name Calls all her sons to battle! at whose name All must go forth, and follow to the field The Leader of the Armies of the Gods, Whom, in his unseen power, Mexitli now Sends out to lead his people. They, in crowds, Throng for their weapons to the House of Arms, Beneath their guardian Deity preserved, Through years of peace; and there the Pabas stood Within the temple-court, and dealt around The ablution of the Stone of Sacrifice, Bidding them with the holy beverage, Imbibe diviner valour, strength of arm Not to be wearied, hope of victory, And certain faith of endless joy in Heaven, Their sure reward... Oh! happy, cried the Priests, Your brethren who have fallen! already they Have joined the company of blessed souls; Already they, with song and harmony, And in the dance of beauty, are gone forth, To follow down his western path of light Yon Sun, the Prince of Glory, from the world Retiring to the Palace of his rest. Oh, happy they, who for their country's cause, And for their Gods, shall die the brave man's death! Them will their country consecrate with praise, Them will the Gods reward! . . They heard the Priests Intoxicate, and from the gate swarmed out, Tumultuous to the fight of martyrdom. But when Cadwallon every moment saw The enemies increase, and with what rage Of drunken valour to the fight they rush'd, He, against that impetuous attack, As best he could, providing, form'd the troops Of Britain into one collected mass: Three equal sides it offered to the foe, Close and compact; no multitude could break The condensed strength: its narrow point prest on, Entering the throng's resistance, like a wedge, Still from behind impell'd. So thought the Chief Likeliest the gates of Aztlan might be gain'd, And Hoel and the Prince preserved if yet They were among mankind. Nor could the force Of hostile thousands break that strength condensed, Against whose iron sides the stream of war Roll'd unavailing, as the ocean waves, Which idly round some insulated rock Foam furious, warning with their silvery smoke The mariner far off. Nor could the point Of that compacted body, though it bore Right on the foe, and with united force Press'd on to enter, through the multitude Win now its difficult way; as where the sea Pours through some strait its violent waters, swoln By inland fresh, vainly the oarmen there With all their weight and strength essay to drive Their galley through the pass, the stress and strain Availing scarce to stem the impetuous stream. And hark! above the deafening din of fight Another shout, heard like the thunder-peal, Amid the war of winds! Lincoya comes, Leading the mountain-dwellers. From the shock Aztlan recoil'd. And now a second troop Of Britons to the town advanced, for war Impatient and revenge. Cadwallon these, With tidings of their gallant Prince enthrall'd, Had summoned from the ships. That dreadful tale Roused them to fury. Not a man was left To guard the fleet; for who could have endured That idle duty? who could have endured The long, inactive, miserable hours, And hope and expectation and the rage Of maddening anguish? Ririd led them on; In whom a brother's love had call'd not up More spirit-stirring pain, than trembled now In every British heart; so dear to all Was Madoc. On they came; and Aztlan then Had fled appall'd; but in that dangerous hour Her faith preserved her. From the gate her Priests Rush'd desperate out, and to the foremost rank Forced their wild way, and fought with martyr zeal. Through all the host contagious fury spread: Nor had the sight that hour enabled them To mightier efforts, had Mexitli, clad In all his imaged terrors, gone before Their way, and driven upon his enemies His giant club destroying. Then more fierce The conflict grew; the din of arms, the yell Of savage rage, the shriek of agony, The groan of death, commingled in one sound Of undistinguished horrors; while the Sun, Retiring slow beneath the plain's far verge, Shed o'er the quiet hills his fading light. XVI. THE WOMEN. Silent and solitary is thy vale, Caermadoc, and how melancholy now That solitude and silence! . . Broad noon-day, And not a sound of human life is there! The fisher's net, abandoned in his haste, Sways idly in the waters; in the tree, Where its last stroke had pierced, the hatchet hangs: The birds, beside the mattock and the spade, Hunt in the new-turn'd mould, and fearlessly Fly through the cage-work of the imperfect wall; Or through the vacant dwelling's open door, Pass and repass secure. In Madoc's house, And on his bed of reeds, Goervyl lies, Her face toward the ground. She neither weeps, Nor sighs, nor groans; too strong her agony For outward sign of anguish, and for prayer Too hopeless was the ill; and though, at times, The pious exclamation past her lips, Thy will be done! yet was that utterance Rather the breathing of a broken heart, Than of a soul resigned. Mervyn beside, Hangs over his dear mistress silently, Having no hope or comfort to bestow, Nor aught but sobs and unavailing tears. The women of Caermadoc, like a flock Collected in their panic, stand around The house of their lost leader; and they too Are mute in their despair. Llaian alone Is absent; wildly hath she wander'd forth To seek her child, and such the general woe, That none hath mark'd her absence. Yet have they Though unprotected thus, no selfish fear; The sudden evil had destroyed all thought, All sense, of present danger to themselves, All foresight. Yet new terrors! Malinal, Panting with speed, bursts in, and takes the arms Of Madoc down. Goervyl, at that sound, Started in sudden hope; but when she saw The Azteca, she uttered a faint scream Of wrongful fear, remembering not the proofs Of his tried truth, nor recognizing aught In those known features, save their hostile hue. But he, by worser fear abating soon Her vain alarm, exclaim'd, I saw a band Of Hoamen coming up the straits, for ill, Besure, for Amalahta leads them on. Buckle this harness on, that, being arm'd, I may defend the entrance. Scarce had she Fastened the breast-plate with her trembling hands, When, flying from the sight of men in arms, The women crowded in. Hastily he seized The shield and spear, and on the threshold took His stand; but, waken'd now to provident thought, Goervyl, following, helm'd him. There was now No time to gird the bauldric on; she held Her brother's sword, and bade him look to her For prompt supply of weapons; in herself Being resolved not idly to abide, Nor unprepared of hand or heart to meet The issue of the danger, nor to die Reluctant now. Rightly had they divined The Hoaman's felon purpose. When he heard The fate of Madoc, from his mother's eye He mask'd his secret joy, and took his arms, And to the rescue, with the foremost band, Set forth. But soon, upon the way, he told The associates of his crime, that now their hour Of triumph was arrived; Caermadoc, left Defenceless, would become, with all its wealth, The spoiler's easy prey, raiment and arms And iron; skins of that sweet beverage, Which to a sense of its own life could stir The joyful blood; the women above all, Whom to the forest they might bear away, To be their slaves, if so their pleasure was; Or, yielding them to Aztlan, for such prize Receive a royal guerdon. Twelve there were, Long leagued with him in guilt, who turn'd aside: And they have reach'd Caermadoc now, and now Rush onward, where they see the women fly; When, on the threshold, clad in Cimbric arms, And with long lance protended, Malinal Rebuffs them from the entrance. At that sight Suddenly quail'd, they stood, as midnight thieves Who find the master waking; but ere long, Gathering a boastful courage, as they saw No other guard, press'd forward, and essay'd To turn his spear aside. Its steady point, True to the impelling strength, held on, and thrust The foremost through the breast, and breath and blood Followed the re-drawn shaft. Nor seem'd the strife Unequal now, though, with their numbers, they Beleaguer'd in half-ring the door, where he, The sole defender, stood. From side to side, So well and swiftly did he veer the lance, That every enemy beheld its point Aim'd at himself direct. But chief on one Had Malinal his deadly purpose fix'd. On Amalahta; by his death to quell The present danger, and cut off the root Of many an evil, certain else to spring From that accursed stock. On him his eye Turn'd with more eager wilfulness, and dwelt With keener ken; and now, with sudden step Bending his body on, at him he drives The meditated blow: but that ill Prince, As chiefly sought, so chiefly fearing, swerved Timely aside; and ere the Azteca Recovered from the frustrate aim, the spear Was seized, and from his hold, by stress and weight Of numbers wrench'd. He, facing still the foe, And holding at arm's length the targe, put back His hand, and called Goervyl, and from her Received the sword: . . in time, for the enemy Prest on so near, that having now no scope To raise his arm, he drove the blade straight on. It entered at the mouth of one who stood With face aslant, and glanced along the teeth Through to the ear, then, slivering downward, left The cheek-flap dangling. He, in that same point Of time, as if a single impulse gave Birth to the double action, dash'd his shield Against another's head, with so fierce swing And sway of strength, that this third enemy Fell at his feet. Astounded by such proof Of prowess, and by unexpected loss Dismayed, the foe gave back, beyond the reach Of his strong arm; and there awhile they stood, Beholding him at bay, and counselling How best to work their vengeance upon him, Their sole opponent. Soon did they behold The vantage, overlook'd by hasty hope, How vulnerable he stood, his arms and thighs Bare for their butt. At once they bent their bows; At once ten arrows fled; seven, shot in vain, Rung on his shield; but, with unhappier mark, Two shafts hung quivering in his leg; a third Below the shoulder pierced. Then Malinal Groan'd, not for anguish of his wounds, but grief And agony of spirit; yet resolved To his last gasp to guard that precious post, Nor longer able to endure afoot, He, falling on his knees, received unharm'd Upon the shield, now ample for defence, Their second shower, and still defied the foe. But they, now sure of conquest, hasten'd on To thrust him down, and he too felt his strength Ebbing away. Goervyl, in that hour Of horror and despair, collected still, Caught him, and by the shoulders drew him in; And, calling on her comrades, with their help Shut to the door in time, and with their weight Secured it, not their strength; for she alone, Found worthy of her noble ancestry, In this emergence felt her faculties All present, and heroic strength of heart, To cope with danger and contempt of death. Shame on ye, British women! shame! exclaim'd The daughter of King Owen, as she saw The trembling hands and bloodless countenance Pale as sepulchral marble; silent some; Others with womanish cries lamenting now That ever, in unhappy hour, they left Their native land; . . a pardonable fear; For hark, the war-whoop! sound, whereto the howl Of tygers or hyenas, heard at night By captive from barbarian foes escaped, And wandering in the pathless wilderness, Were music. Shame on ye! Goervyl cried; Think what your fathers were, your husbands what, And what your sons should be! These savages Seek not to wreak on ye immediate death; So are ye safe, if safety such as this Be worth a thought; and in the interval We yet may gain, by keeping to the last This entrance, easily to be maintain'd By us, though women, against foes so few, . . Who knows what succour chance, or timely thought Of our own friends may send, or Providence, Who slumbereth not? . . While thus she spake, a hand In at the window came, of one who sought That way to win the entrance. She drew out The arrow through the arm of Malinal, With gentle care, . . the readiest weapon that, . . And held it short above the boney barb, And, adding deeds to words, with all her might She stabbed it through the hand. The sudden pain Provoked a cry, and back the savage fell, Loosening his hold, and maim'd for further war. Nay! leave that entrance open! she exclaim'd To one who would have closed it, . . who comes next Shall not go thence so cheaply! . . for she now Had taken up a spear to guard that way, Easily guarded, even by female might. O heart of proof! what now avails thy worth And excellent courage? for the savage foe, With mattock and with spade, for other use Design'd, hew now upon the door, and rend The wattled sides; and they within shrink back, For now it splinters through, . . and lo, the way Is open to the spoiler! Then once more, Collecting his last strength, did Malinal Rise on his knees, and over him the maid Stands with the ready spear, she guarding him Who guarded her so well. Roused to new force By that exampled valour, and with will To achieve one service yet before he died, . . If death indeed, as sure he thought, were nigh, . . Malinal gathered up his fainting powers; And reaching forward, with a blow that threw His body on, upon the knee he smote One Hoaman more, and brought him to the ground. The foe fell over him; but he, prepared, Threw him with sudden jerk aside, and rose Upon one hand, and with the other plunged Between his ribs the mortal blade. Meantime Amalahta, rushing in blind eagerness To seize Goervyl, set at nought the power Of female hands and stooping as he came, Beneath her spear-point, thought with lifted arm To turn the thrust aside. But she drew back, And lowered at once the spear, with aim so sure, That on the front it met him, and ploughed up The whole scalp-length. He, blinded by the blood, Staggered aside, escaping by that chance A second push, else mortal. And by this, The women, learning courage from despair, And by Goervyl's bold example fired, Took heart, and rushing on with one accord, Drove out the foe. Then took they hope; for then They saw but seven remain in plight for war; And, knowing their own number, in the pride Of strength, caught up stones, staves, or axe, or spear, To hostile use converting whatsoe'er The hasty hand could seize. Such fierce attack Confused the ruffian band; nor had they room To aim the arrow, nor to speed the spear, Each now beset by many. But their Prince, Still mindful of his purport, call'd to them, . . Secure my passage while I bear away The White King's Sister; having her, the law Of peace is in our power... And on he went Toward Goervyl, and, with sudden turn, While on another foe her eye was fix'd, Ran in upon her, and stoopt down, and claspt The maid above the knees, and throwing her Over his shoulder, to the valley straits Set off: . . ill seconded in ill attempt; For now his comrades are too close beset To aid their Chief, and Mervyn hath beheld His lady's peril. At the sight, inspired With force, as if indeed that manly garb Had clothed a manly heart, the Page ran on, And with a bill-hook striking at his ham, Cut the back sinews. Amalahta fell; The Maid fell with him: and she first hath risen, While, grovelling on the earth, he gnash'd his teeth For agony. Yet, even in those pangs, Remembering still revenge, he turn'd and seized Goervyl's skirt, and pluck'd her to the ground, And roll'd himself upon her, and essayed To kneel upon her breast; but she clench'd fast His bloody locks, and drew him down aside, Faint now with anguish, and with loss of blood; And Mervyn, coming to her help again, As once again he rose, around the neck Seized him, with throttling grasp, and held him down, . . Strange strife and liorrible, . . till Malinal Crawl'd to the spot, and thrust into his groin The mortal sword of Madoc; he himself, At the same moment, fainting, now no more By his strong will upheld, the service done. The few surviving traitors, at the sight Of their fallen Prince and Leader, now too late Believed that some diviner power had given These female arms strength for their overthrow, Themselves proved weak before them, as, of late, Their God, by Madoc crush'd. Away they fled Toward the valley straits; but in the gorge Erillyab met their flight: and then her heart, Boding the evil, smote her, and she bade Her people seize, and bring them on in bonds, For judgment. She herself, with quicken'd pace, Advanced, to know the worst; and o'er the dead Casting a rapid glance, she knew her son. She knew him by his garments, by the work Of her own hands; for now his face, besmeared And black with gore, and stiffened in its pangs, Bore of the life no semblance... God is good! She cried, and closed her eyelids, and her lips Shook, and her countenance changed. But in her heart She quell'd the natural feeling... Bear away These wretches! . . to her followers she exclaim'd; And root them from the earth. Then she approach'd Goervyl, who was pale and trembling now, Exhausted with past effort; and she took Gently the maiden's tremulous hand, and said, God comfort thee, my Sister! At that voice Of consolation, from her dreamy state, Goervyl to a sense of all her woe Awoke, and burst into a gush of tears. God comfort thee, my Sister! cried the Queen, Even as He strengthens me. I would not raise Deceitful hope, . . but in His Hand, even yet, The issue hangs; and He is merciful. Yea, daughter of Aberfraw, take thou hope! For Madoc lives! . . he lives to wield the sword Of righteous vengeance, and accomplish all. XVII. THE DELIVERANCE. Madoc, meantime, in bonds and solitude, Lay listening to the tumult. How his heart Panted! how then with fruitless strength, he strove And struggled for enlargement, as the sound Of battle from without the city came; While all things near were still, nor foot of man Nor voice, in that deserted part, were heard. At length one light and solitary step Approach'd the place; a woman cross'd the door From Madoc's busy mind her image pass'd, Quick as the form that caused it; but not so Did the remembrance fly from Coatel, That Madoc lay in bonds. That thought possess'd Her soul, and made her, as she garlanded The fane of Coatlantona with flowers, Tremble in strong emotion. It was now The hour of dusk; the Pabas all were gone, Gone to the battle; . . none could see her steps; The gate was nigh. A momentary thought Shot through her; she delayed not to reflect, But hastened to the Prince, and took the knife Of sacrifice, which by the altar hung, And cut his bonds, and with an eager eye, Motioning haste and silence, to the gate She led him. Fast along the forest way, And fearfully, he followed to the chasm. She beckon'd, and descended, and drew out From underneath her vest, a cage, or net It rather might be called, so fine the twigs Which knit it, where confined two fire-flies gave Their lustre. By that light did Madoc first Behold the features of his lovely guide; And through the entrance of the cavern gloom, He followed in full trust. Now have they reach'd The abrupt descent; there Coatel held forth Her living lamp, and turning, with a smile Sweet as good Angels wear when they present Their mortal charge before the throne of Heaven, She show'd where little Hoel slept below. Poor child! he lay upon that very spot, The last whereto his feet had followed her; And, as he slept, his hand was on the bones Of one, who years agone had perish'd there, There, on the place where last his wretched eyes Could catch the gleam of day. But when the voice, The well-known voice of Madoc wakened him, . . His Uncle's voice, . . he started, with a scream Which echoed through the cavern's winding length, And stretch'd his arms to reach him. Madoc hush'd The dangerous transport, raised him up the ascent, And followed Coatel again, whose face, Though tears of pleasure still were coursing down Betokened fear and haste. Adown the wood They went; and coasting now the lake, her eye First what they sought beheld, a light canoe, Moor'd to the bank. Then in her arms she took The child, and kiss'd him with maternal love, And placed him in the boat; but when the Prince, With looks and gestures and imperfect words Such as the look, the gesture, well explain'd, Urged her to follow, doubtfully she stood: A dread of danger, for the thing she had done, Came on her, and Lincoya rose to mind. Almost she had resolved; but then she thought Of her dear father, whom that flight would leave Alone in age; how he would weep for her, As one among the dead, and to the grave Go sorrowing; or, if ever it were known What she had dared, that on his head the weight Of punishment would fall. That dreadful fear Resolved her, and she waved her head, and raised Her hand, to bid the Prince depart in haste, With looks whose painful seriousness forbade All farther effort. Yet unwillingly, And boding evil, Madoc from the shore Push'd off his little boat. She on its way Stood gazing for a moment, lost in thought, Then struck into the woods. Swift through the lake Madoc's strong arm impell'd the light canoe. Fainter and fainter to his distant ear The sound of battle came; and now the Moon Arose in heaven, and poured o'er lake and land A soft and mellowing ray. Along the shore Llaian was wandering with distracted steps, And groaning for her child. She saw the boat Approach; and as on Madoc's naked limbs, And on his countenance, the moonbeam fell, And as she saw the boy in that dim light, It seemed as though the Spirits of the dead Were moving on the waters; and she stood With open lips that breathed not, and fix'd eyes, Watching the unreal shapes: but when the boat Drew nigh, and Madoc landed, and she saw His step substantial, and the child came near, Unable then to move, or speak, or breathe, Down on the sand she sank. But who can tell, Who comprehend, her agony of joy, When, by the Prince's care restored to sense, She recognized her child, she heard the name Of mother from that voice, which, sure, she thought Had pour'd upon some Priest's remorseless ear Its last vain prayer for life! No tear relieved The insupportable feeling that convulsed Her swelling breast. She look'd, and look'd, and felt The child, lest some delusion should have mock'd Her soul to madness; then the gushing joy Burst forth, and with caresses and with tears She mingled broken prayers of thanks to heaven. And now the Prince, when joy had had its course, Said to her, Knowest thou the mountain path? For I would to the battle. But at that, A sudden damp of dread came over her, . . O leave us not! she cried; lest haply ill Should have befallen; for I remember now, How in the woods I spied a savage band Making towards Caermadoc. God forefend The evil that I fear! . . What! Madoc cried, Were ye then left defenceless? . . She replied, All ran to arms: there was no time for thought, Nor counsel, in that sudden ill; nor one Of all thy people, who could, in that hour, Have brook'd home-duty, when thy life or death Hung on the chance. Now God be merciful! Said he; for of Goervyl then he thought, And the cold sweat started at every pore. Give me the boy! . . he travels all too slow. Then in his arms he took him, and sped on, Suffering more painful terrors, than of late His own near death provoked. They held their way In silence up the heights; and, when at length They reached the entrance of the vale, the Prince Bade her remain, while he went on, to spy The footsteps of the spoiler. Soon he saw Men, in the moonlight, stretch'd upon the ground; And quickening then his pace, in worse alarm, Along the shade, with cautious step, he moved Toward one, to seize his weapons: 'twas a corpse; Nor whether, at the sight, to hope or fear Yet knew he. But anon, a steady light, As of a taper, seen in his own home, Comforted him; and, drawing nearer now, He saw his sister on her knees, beside The rushes, ministering to a wounded man. Safe that the dear one lived, then back he sped With joyful haste, and summon'd Llaian on, And in loud talk advanced. Erillyab first Came forward at the sound; for she had faith To trust the voice... They live! they live! she cried God hath redeem'd them! . . Nor the Maiden yet Believed the actual joy; like one astound, Or as if struggling with a dream, she stood, Till he came close, and spread his arms, and call'd Goervyl! . . and she fell in his embrace. But Madoc lingered not, his eager soul Was in the war, in haste he donn'd his arms; And as he felt his own good sword again, Exulting played his heart... Boy, he exclaim'd To Mervyn, arm thyself, and follow me! For in this battle we shall break the power Of our blood-thirsty foe: and, in thine age, Would'st thou not wish, when young men crowd around, To hear thee chronicle their fathers' deeds, Would'st thou not wish to add, . . And I, too, fought In that day's conflict? Mervyn's cheek turn'd pale A moment, then, with terror all suffused, Grew fever-red. Nay, nay, Goervyl cried, He is too young for battles! . . But the Prince, With erring judgement, in that fear-flush'd cheek Beheld the glow of enterprising hope, And youthful courage. I was such a boy Sister! he cried, at Counsyllt; and that day, In my first field, with stripling arm, smote down Many a tall Saxon. saidst thou not but now, How bravely in the fight of yesterday, He flesh'd his sword, . . and wouldst thou keep him here And rob him of his glory? See his cheek! How it hath crimson'd at the unworthy thought! Arm! arm! and to the battle! How her heart Then panted! how, with late regret, and vain, Senena wished Goervyl then had heard The secret, trembling on her lips so oft, So oft by shame withheld. She thought that now She could have fallen upon her Lady's neck, And told her all; but when she saw the Prince, Imperious shame forbade her, and she felt It were an easier thing to die than speak. Avail'd not now regret or female fear! She mail'd her delicate limbs; beneath the plate Compress'd her bosom; on her golden locks The helmet's overheavy load she placed; Hung from her neck the shield; and, though the sword Which swung beside her lightest she had chosen, Though in her hand she held the slenderest spear, Alike unwieldy for the maiden's grasp, The sword and ashen lance. But as she touch'd The murderous point, an icey shudder ran Through every fibre of her trembling frame; And, overcome by womanly terror then, The damsel to Goervyl turn'd, and let The breastplate fall, and on her bosom placed The Lady's hand, and hid her face, and cried Save me! The warrior, who beheld the act, And heard not the low voice, with angry eye Glow'd on the seemly boy of feeble heart. But, in Goervyl, joy had overpower'd The wonder; joy, to find the boy she loved Was one, to whom her heart with closer love Might cling; and to her brother she exclaim'd, She must not go! We women in the war Have done our parts. A moment Madoc dwelt On the false Mervyn, with an eye from whence Displeasure did not wholly pass away. Nor loitering to resolve Love's riddle now To Malinal he turn'd, where, on his couch, The wounded youth was laid... True friend, said he, And brother mine, . . for truly by that name I trust to greet thee, . . if in this near fight, My hour should overtake me, . . as who knows The lot of war? . . Goervyl hath my charge To quite thee for thy service with herself; That so thou mayest raise up seed to me Of mine own blood, who may inherit here The obedience of thy people and of mine... Malinal took his hand, and to his lips Feebly he prest it, saying, One boon more, Father and friend, I ask! . . if thou shouldse meet Yuhidthiton in battle, think of me. XVIII. THE VICTORY. Merciful God! how horrible is night Upon the plain of Aztlan! there the shout Of battle, the barbarian yell, the bray Of dissonant instruments, the clang of arms, The shriek of agony, the groan of death, In one wild uproar and continuous din, Shake the still air; while, overhead, the Moon, Regardless of the stir of this low world, Holds on her heavenly way. Still unallay'd By slaughter raged the battle, unrelax'd By lengthened toil; anger supplying still Strength undiminish'd for the desperate strife. And lo! where yonder, on the temple top, Blazing aloft, the sacrificial fire Scene more accurst and hideous than the war, Displays to all the vale; for whosoe'er That night the Aztecas could bear away, Hoaman or Briton, thither was he borne; And as they stretch'd him on the stone of blood, Did the huge tambour of the God, with voice Loud as the thunder-peal, and heard as far, Proclaim the act of death, more visible Than in broad day-light, by those midnight fires Distinctlier seen. Sight that with horror fill'd The Cymry, and to mightier efforts roused. Howbeit, this abhorred idolatry Work'd for their safety; the deluded foes, Obstinate in their faith, forbearing still The mortal stroke, that they might to the God Present the living victim, and to him Let the life flow. And now the orient sky Glow'd with the ruddy morning, when the Prince Came to the field. He lifted up his voice, And shouted Madoc! Madoc! They who heard The cry, astonish'd turn'd; and when they saw The countenance his open helm disclosed, They echoed, Madoc! Madoc! Through the host Spread the miraculous joy, . . He lives! he lives! He comes himself in arms! . . Lincoya heard, As he had raised his arm to strike a foe, And stay'd the stroke, and thrust him off, and cried, Go tell the tidings to thy countrymen, Madoc is in the war! Tell them his God Hath set the White King free! Astonishment Seized on the Azteca; on all who heard, Amazement and dismay; and Madoc now Stood in the foremost battle, and his sword, . . His own good sword, . . flash'd like the sudden death Of lightning in their eyes. The King of Aztlan Heard and beheld, and in his noble heart Heroic hope arose. Forward he moved, And in the shock of battle, front to front, Encountered Madoc. A strong-statured man Coanocotzin stood, one well who knew The ways of war, and never yet in fight Had found an equal foe. Adown his back Hung the long robe of feathered royalty; Gold fenced his arms and legs; upon his helm A sculptured snake protends the arrowy tongue; Around a coronal of plumes arose, Brighter than beam the rainbow hues of light, Or than the evening glories which the sun Slants o'er the moving many-colour'd sea, Such their surpassing beauty; bells of gold Emboss'd his glittering helmet, and where'er Their sound was heard, there lay the press of war, And Death was bussiest there. Over the breast And o'er the golden breastplate of the King, A feathery cuirass, beautiful to eye, Light as the robe of peace, yet strong to save; For the sharp faulchion's baffled edge would glide From its smooth softness. On his arm he held A buckler overlaid with beaten gold; And so he stood, guarding his thighs and legs, His breast and shoulders also, with the length Of his broad shield. Opposed, in mail complete, Stood Madoc in his strength. The flexile chains Gave play to his full muscles, and displayed How broad his shoulders, and his ample breast. Small was his shield, there broadest where it fenced The well of life, and gradual to a point Lessening, steel-strong, and wieldy in his grasp. It bore those blazoned eaglets, at whose sight, Along the Marches, or where holy Dee Through Cestrian pastures rolls his tamer stream, So oft the yeoman had, in days of yore, Cursing his perilous tenure, wound the horn, And warden from the castle-tower rung out The loud alarum-bell, heard far and wide. Upon his helm no sculptured dragon sate, Sate no fantastic terrors; a white plume Nodded above, far-seen, floating like foam Upon the stream of battle, always where The tide ran strongest. Man to man opposed, The Sea Lord and the King of Aztlan stood. Fast on the intervening buckler fell The Azteca's stone faulchion. Who hath watch'd The midnight lightnings of the summer storm, That with their awful blaze, irradiate heaven, Then leave a blacker night? so quick, so fierce, Flash'd Madoc's sword, which, like the serpent's tongue, Seemed double, in its rapid whirl of light. Unequal arms! for on the British shield Avail'd not the stone faulchion's brittle edge, And in the golden buckler, Madoc's sword Bit deep. Coanocotzin saw, and dropt The unprofitable weapon, and received His ponderous club, . . that club, beneath whose force, Driven by his father's arm, Tepollomi Had fallen subdued, . . and fast and fierce he drove The massy weight on Madoc. From his shield, The deadening force communicated ran Up his stunn'd arm; anon, upon his helm, Crashing, it came; . . his eyes shot fire, his brain Swam dizzy, . . he recoils, . . he reels, . . again The club descends. That danger to himself Recall'd the Lord of Ocean. On he sprung, Within the falling weapon's curve of death, Shunning its frustrate aim, and breast to breast He grappled with the King. The pliant mail Bent to his straining limbs, while plates of gold, The feathery robe, the buckler's amplitude, Cumbered the Azteca, and from his arm, Clench'd in the Briton's mighty grasp, at once He dropt the impeding buckler, and let fall The unfastened club; which when the Prince beheld, He thrust him off, and drawing back resumed The sword that from his wrist suspended hung, And twice he smote the King; twice from the quilt Of plumes the iron glides; and lo! the King, So well his soldiers watch their monarch's need, Shakes in his hand a spear. But now a cry Burst on the ear of Madoc, and he saw Through opening ranks, where Urien was convey'd A captive, to his death. Grief then and shame And rage inspired him. With a mighty blow He cleft Coanocotzin's helm; exposed The monarch stood; . . again the thunder-stroke Came on him, and he fell... The multitude, Forgetful of their country and themselves, Crowd round their dying King. Madoc, whose eye Still follow'd Urien, call'd upon his men, And through the broken army of the foe, Prest to his rescue. But far off the old man Was borne with furious speed. Ririd alone Pursued his path, and through the thick of war Close on the captors, with avenging sword, Follow'd right on, and through the multitude, And through the gate of Aztlan, made his way, And through the streets, till, from the temple-mound, The press of Pabas and the populace Repell'd him, while the old man was hurried up. Hark! that infernal tambour! o'er the lake Its long loud thunders roll, and through the hills, Awakening all their echoes. Ye accurst, Ye blow the fall too soon! Ye Dogs of Hell, The Hart is yet at bay! . . Thus long the old man, As one exhausted or resign'd, had lain, Resisting not; but at that knell of death, Springing with unexpected force, he freed His feet, and shook the Pabas from their hold, And, with his armed hand, between the eyes Smote one so sternly, that to earth he fell, Bleeding, and all astound. A man of proof Was Urien in his day, thought worthiest, In martial thewes and manly discipline, To train the sons of Owen. He had lost Youth's supple slight; yet still the skill remain'd, And in his stiffen'd limbs a strength, which yet Might put the young to shame. And now he set His back against the altar, resolute Not as a victim by the knife to die, But in the act of battle, as became A man grown grey in arms: and in his heart There was a living hope; for now he knew That Madoc lived, nor could the struggle long Endure against that arm. Soon was the way Laid open by the sword; for side by side The brethren of Aberfraw mow'd their path; And, following close, the Cymry drive along, Till on the summit of the mound their cry Of victory rings aloud. The temple floor, So often which had reek'd with innocent blood, Reeks now with righteous slaughter. Franticly, In the wild fury of their desperate zeal, The Priests crowd round the God, and with their knives Hack at the foe, and call on him to save; . . At the altar, at the Idol's feet they fall. Nor with less frenzy did the multitude Flock to defend their God. Fast as they fell, New victims rush'd upon the British sword; And sure that day had rooted from the earth The Aztecas, and on their conquerors drawn Promiscuous ruin, had not Madoc now Beheld from whence the fearless ardour sprang; . . They saw Mexitli; momently they hoped That he would rise in vengeance. Madoc seized A massy club, and from his azure throne Shattered the giant idol. At that sight The men of Aztlan pause; so was their pause Dreadful, as when a multitude expect The Earthquake's second shock. But when they saw Earth did not open, nor the temple fall To crush their impious enemies, dismay'd, They felt themselves forsaken by their Gods; Then from their temples and their homes they fled, And, leaving Aztlan to the conqueror, Sought the near city, whither they had sent Their women, timely saved. But Tlalala, With growing fury as the danger grew, Raged in the battle; but Yuhidthiton Still with calm courage, till no hope remain'd, Fronted the rushing foe. When all was vain, When back within the gate Cadwallon's force Resistless had compell'd them, then the Chief Call'd on the Tyger, . . Let us bear from hence The dead Ocellopan, the slaughter'd King; Not to the Strangers should their bones be left, O Tlalala! . . The Tyger wept with rage, With generous anger. To the place of death, Where, side by side, the noble dead were stretch'd, They fought their way. Eight warriors join'd their shields; On these, a bier which well beseem'd the dead, The lifeless Chiefs were laid. Yuhidthiton Call'd on the people, . . Men of Aztlan! yet One effort more! Bear hence Ocellopan, Bear hence the body of your noble King! Not to the Strangers should their bones be left! That whoso heard, with wailing and loud cries, Prest round the body-bearers; few indeed, For few were they who in that fearful hour Had ears to hear, . . but with a holy zeal, Careless of death, around the bier they ranged Their bulwark breasts. So toward the farther gate They held their steady way, while outermost In unabated valour, Tlalala Faced, with Yuhidthiton, the foe's pursuit. Vain valour then, and fatal piety, As the fierce conquerors bore on their retreat, If Madoc had not seen their perilous strife: Remembering Malinal, and in his heart Honouring a gallant foe, he call'd aloud, And bade his people cease the hot pursuit. So, through the city gate, they bore away The dead; and, last of all their countrymen, Leaving their homes and temples to the foe, Yuhidthiton and Tlalala retired. XIX. THE FUNERAL. Southward of Aztlan stood beside the Lake, A city of the Aztecas, by name Patamba. Thither, from the first alarm, The women and infirm old men were sent, And children: thither they who from the fight, And from the fall of Aztlan, had escaped, In scattered bands repair'd. Their City lost, Their Monarch slain, their Idols overthrown, . . These tidings spread dismay; but to dismay Succeeded horror soon, and kindling rage, Horror, by each new circumstance increased, By numbers, rage embolden'd. Lo! to the town, Lamenting loud, a numerous train approach, Like mountain torrents, swelling as they go. Borne in the midst, upon the bier of shields, The noble dead were seen. To tenfold grief That spectacle provoked, to tenfold wrath That anguish stung them. With their yells and groans Curses are mix'd, and threats, and bitter vows Of vengeance full and speedy. From the wreck Of Aztlan who is saved? Tezozomoc, Chief servant of the Gods, their favoured Priest The voice by whom they speak; young Tlalala, Whom even defeat with fresher glory crowns; And full of fame, their country's rock of strength, Yuhidthiton: him to their sovereign slain Allied in blood, mature in wisdom him, Of valour unsurpassable, by all Beloved and honour'd, him the general voice Acclaims their King; him they demand, to lead Their gathered force to battle, to revenge Their Lord, their Gods, their kinsmen, to redeem Their altars and their country. But the dead First from the nation's gratitude require The rites of death. On mats of mountain palm, Wrought of rare texture and of richest hues, The slaughter'd warriors, side by side, were laid; Their bodies wrapt in many-colour'd robes Of gossampine, bedeck'd with gems and gold. The livid paleness of the countenance, A mask conceal'd, and hid their ghastly wounds. The Pabas stood around, and one by one, Placed in their hands the sacred aloe leaves, With mystic forms and characters inscribed; And as each leaf was given, Tezozomoc Address'd the dead, . . So may ye safely pass Between the mountains, which in endless war Hurtle, with horrible uproar and frush Of rocks that meet in battle. Arm'd with this, In safety shall ye walk along the road, Where the Great Serpent from his lurid eyes Shoots lightening, and across the guarded way Vibrates his tongue of fire. Receive the third, And cross the waters where the Crocodile In vain expects his prey. Your passport this Through the Eight Deserts; through the Eight Hills this; And this be your defence against the Wind, Whose fury sweeps like dust the uprooted rocks, Whose keenness cuts the soul. Ye noble Dead, Protected with these potent amulets, Soon shall your Spirits reach triumphantly The Palace of the Sun! The funeral train Moved to Mexitli's temple. First on high The noble dead were borne; in loud lament Then follow'd all by blood allied to them, Or by affection's voluntary ties Attach'd more closely, brethren, kinsmen, wives. The Peers of Aztlan, all who from the sword Of Britain had escaped, honouring the rites, Came clad in rich array, and bore the arms And ensigns of the dead. The slaves went last, And dwarfs, the pastime of the living chiefs, In life their sport and mockery, and in death Their victims. Wailing and with funeral hymns, The long procession moved. Mexitli's Priest, With all his servants, from the temple-gate Advanced to meet the train. Two piles were built Within the sacred court, of odorous wood, And rich with gums; on these, with all their robes, Their ensigns and their arms, they laid the dead, Then lit the pile. The rapid light ran up, Up flamed the fire, and o'er the darken'd sky Sweet clouds of incense curl'd. The Pabas then Perform'd their bloody office. First they slew The women whom the slaughter'd most had loved, Who most had loved the dead. Silent they went Toward the fatal stone, resisting not, Nor sorrowing, nor dismay'd, but, as it seem'd, Stunn'd, senseless. One alone there was, whose cheek Was flush'd, whose eye was animate with fire Her most in life Coanocotzin prized, By ten years' love endear'd, his counsellor, His friend, the partner of his secret thoughts; Such had she been, such merited to be. She as she bared her bosom to the knife, Call'd on Yuhidthiton... Take heed, O King! Aloud she cried, and pointed to the Priests, Beware these wicked men! they to the war Forced my dead Lord... Thou knowest, and I know, He loved the Strangers; that his noble mind, Enlighten'd by their lore, had willingly Put down these cursed altars! . . As she spake, They dragg'd her to the stone... Nay! nay! she cried, There needs not force! I go to join my Lord! His blood and mine be on you! . . Ere she ceased, The knife was in her breast. Tezozomoc, Trembling with rage, held up toward the Sun Her reeking heart. The dwarfs and slaves died last. That bloody office done, they gathered up The ashes of the dead, and coffer'd them Apart; the teeth with them, which unconsumed Among the ashes lay, a single lock Shorn from the corpse, and his lip-emerald Now held to be the Spirit's flawless heart, In better worlds. The Priest then held on high The little ark which shrined his last remains, And call'd upon the people; . . Aztecas, This was your King, the bountiful, the brave, Coanocotzin! Men of Aztlan, hold His memory holy! learn from him to love Your country and your Gods; for them to live Like him, like him to die. So from yon Heaven, Where in the Spring of Light his Spirit bathes, Often shall he descend; hover above On evening clouds, or plumed with rainbow wings, Sip honey from the flowers, and warble joy. Honour his memory! emulate his worth! So saying, in the temple-tower he laid The relics of the King. These duties done, The living claim their care. His birth, his deeds, The general love, the general voice, have mark'd Yuhidthiton for King. Bare-headed, bare Of foot, of limb, scarfed only round the loins, The Chieftain to Mexitli's temple moved, And knelt before the God. Tezozomoc King over Aztlan there anointed him, And over him, from hallowed cedar-branch, Sprinkled the holy water. Then the Priest In a black garment robed him, figured white With skulls and bones, a garb to emblem war, Slaughter, and ruin, his imperial tasks. Next in his hand the Priest a censer placed; And while he knelt, directing to the God The steaming incense, thus address'd the King: Chosen by the people, by the Gods approved, Swear to protect thy subjects, to maintain The worship of thy fathers, to observe Their laws, to make the Sun pursue his course, The clouds descend in rain, the rivers hold Their wonted channels, and the fruits of earth To ripen in their season; Swear, O King! And prosper, as thou holdest good thine oath. He raised his voice, and swore. Then on his brow Tezozomoc the crown of Aztlan placed; And in the robe of emblem'd royalty, Preceded by the golden wands of state, Yuhidthiton went forth, anointed King. XX. THE DEATH OF COATEL. When now the multitude beheld their King, In gratulations of reiterate joy They shout his name, and bid him lead them on To vengeance. But to answer that appeal Tezozomoc advanced... Oh! go not forth, Cried the Chief Paba, till the land be purged From her offence! No God will lead ye on, While there is guilt in Atzlan. Let the Priests Who from the ruined city have escaped, And all who in her temples have perform'd The ennobling service of her injured Gods, Gather together now. He spake; the train Assembled, priests and matrons, youths and maids. Servants of Heaven! aloud the Arch-Priest began, The Gods had favour'd Aztlan; bound for death The White King lay: our countrymen were strong In battle, and the conquest had been ours, . . I speak not from myself, but as the Powers, Whose voice on earth I am, impel the truth, . . The conquest had been ours; but treason lurk'd In Aztlan, treason and foul sacrilege; And therefore were her children in the hour Of need abandon'd; therefore were her youth Cut down, her altars therefore overthrown. The White King, whom ye saw upon the Stone Of Sacrifice, and whom ye held in bonds, Stood in the foremost fight and slew your Lord. Not by a God, O Aztecas, enlarged Broke he his bondage! by a mortal hand, An impious, sacrilegious, traitorous hand, Your city was betray'd, your King was slain, Your shrines polluted. The insulted Power, He who is terrible, beheld the deed, And now he calls for vengeance. Stern he spake, And from Mexitli's altar bade the Priest Bring forth the sacred water. In his hand He took the vase, and held it up, and cried, Accurst be he who did this deed! Accurst The father who begat him, and the breast At which he fed! Death be his portion now, Eternal infamy his lot on earth, His doom eternal horrors! Let his name, From sire to son, be in the people's mouth, Through every generation! Let a curse Of deep and pious and effectual hate, For ever follow the detested name; And every curse inflict upon his soul A stab of mortal anguish. Then he gave The vase... Drink one by one! the innocent Boldly; on them the water hath no power; But let the guilty tremble! it shall flow A draught of agony and death to him, A stream of fiery poison. Coatel! What were thy horrors when the fatal vase Past to thy trial, . . when Tezozomoc Fixed his keen eye on thee! A deathiness Came over her, . . her blood ran back, . . her joints Shook like the palsy, and the dreadful cup Dropt from her conscious hold. The Priest exclaim'd, The hand of God! the avenger manifest! Drag her to the altar! . . At that sound of death The life forsook her limbs, and down she fell, Senseless. They dragg'd her to the Stone of Blood, All senseless as she lay; . . in that dread hour Nature was kind. Tezozomoc then cried, Bring forth the kindred of this wretch accurst, That none pollute the earth! An aged Priest Came forth and answered, There is none but I, The father of the dead. To death with him! Exclaim'd Tezozomoc; to death with him; And purify the nation! . . But the King Permitted not that crime... Chief of the Priests, If he be guilty, let the guilty bleed, Said he; but never, while I live and reign, The innocent shall suffer. Hear him speak! Hear me! the old man replied. That fatal day I never saw my child. At morn she left The city, seeking flowers to dress the shrine Of Coatlantona; and that at eve I stood among the Pabas in the gate, Blessing our soldiers, as they issued out, Let them who saw bear witness... Two came forth, And testified Aculhua spake the words Of truth. Full well I know, the old man pursued, My daughter loved the Strangers, . . that her heart Was not with Aztlan; but not I the cause! Ye all remember how the Maid was given, . . She being, in truth, of all our Maids the flower, . . In spousals to Lincoya, him who fled From sacrifice. It was a misery For me to see my only child condemn'd In early widowhood to waste her youth, . . My only and my beautifullest girl! Chief of the Priests, you order'd; I obeyed. Not mine the fault, if when Lincoya fled, And fought among the enemies, her heart Was with her husband. He is innocent! He shall not die! Yuhidthiton exclaim'd. Nay, King Yuhidthiton! Aculhua cried, I merit death. My country overthrown, My daughter slain, alike demand on me That justice. When her years of ministry Vow'd to the temple had expired, my love, My selfish love, still suffer'd her to give Her youth to me, by filial piety In widowhood detain'd. That selfish crime Heavily, . . heavily, . . do I expiate! But I am old; and she was all to me. O King Yuhidthiton, I ask for death; In mercy, let me die! cruel it were To bid me waste away alone in age, By the slow pain of grief... Give me the knife Which pierced my daughter's bosom! The old man Moved to the altar; none opposed his way; With a firm hand he buried in his heart The reeking flint, and fell upon his child. XXI. THE SPORTS. A transitory gloom that sight of death Impress'd upon the assembled multitude; But soon the brute and unreflecting crew Turn'd to their sports. Some bare their olive limbs, And in the race contend; with hopes and fears Which rouse to rage, some urge the mimic war. Here one upon his ample shoulders bears A comrade's weight, upon whose head a third Stands poised, like Mercury in act to fly. Two others balance here on their shoulders A bifork'd beam, while on its height a third To nimble cadence shifts his glancing feet, And shakes a plume aloft, and wheels around A wreath of bells with modulating sway. Here round a lofty mast the dancers move Quick, to quick music; from its top affix'd, Each holds a coloured cord, and as they weave The complex crossings of the mazy dance, The checquer'd network twists around the tree Its intertexture of harmonious hues. But now a shout went forth, the Flyers mount, And from all meaner sports the multitude Flock to their favourite pastime. In the ground, Branchless and bark'd, the trunk of some tall pine Is planted; near its summit a square frame; Four cords pass through the perforated square, And fifty times and twice around the tree, A mystic number, are entwined above. Four Aztecas, equipp'd with wings, ascend, And round them bind the ropes; anon they wave Their pinions, and upborn on spreading plumes Launch on the air, and wheel in circling flight, The lengthening cords untwisting as they fly. A fifth above, upon the perilous point Dances, and shakes a flag; and on the frame, Others the while maintain their giddy stand, Till now, with many a round, the wheeling cords Draw near their utmost length, and toward the ground The aërial circlers speed; then down the ropes They spring, and on their way from line to line Pass, while the shouting multitude endure A shuddering admiration. On such sports, Their feelings center'd in the joy of sight, The multitude stood gazing, when a man, Breathless, and with broad eyes, came running on, His pale lips trembling, and his bloodless cheek Like one who meets a lion in his path. The fire! the fire! the temple! he exclaim'd; Mexitli! . . They, astonish'd at his words, Hasten toward the wonder, . . and behold! The inner fane is sheeted white with fire. Dumb with affright they stood; the enquiring King Look'd to Tezozomoc; the Priest replied, I go! the Gods protect me; . . and therewith He entered boldly in the house of flame. But instant bounding with inebriate joy, He issues forth... The God! the God! he cries, Joy! . . joy! . . the God! . . the visible hand of Heaven! Repressing then his transport, . . Ye all know How that in Aztlan Madoc's impious hand Destroyed Mexitli's image; . . it is here, Unbroken, and the same! . . Toward the gate They press; they see the Giant Idol there, The serpent girding him, his neck with hearts Beaded, and in his hand the club, . . even such As oft in Aztlan, on his azure throne, They had adored the God, they see him now, Unbroken and the same! . . Again the Priest Enter'd; again a second joy inspired To frenzy all around; . . for forth he came, Shouting with new delight, . . for in his hand The banner of the nation he upheld, That banner to their fathers sent from Heaven, By them abandoned to the conqueror. He motion'd silence, and the crowd were still. People of Aztlan! he began, when first Your fathers from their native land went forth, In search of better seats, this banner came From Heaven. The Famine and the Pestilence Had been among them; in their hearts the spring Of courage was dried up: with midnight fires Radiate, by midnight thunders heralded, This banner came from Heaven; and with it came Health, valour, victory. Aztecas! again The God restores the blessing. To the God Move now in solemn dance of grateful joy; Exalt for him the song. They form'd the dance, They raised the hymn, and sung Mexitli's praise. Glory to thee, the Great, the Terrible, Mexitli, guardian God! . . From whence art thou, O Son of Mystery? From whence art thou, Whose sire thy Mother knew not? She at eve Walk'd in the temple court, and saw from Heaven A plume descend, as bright and beautiful, As if some spirit had embodied there The rainbow hues, or dipt it in the light Of setting suns. To her it floated down; She placed it in her bosom, to bedeck The altar of the God; she sought it there; Amazed she found it not; amazed she felt Another life infused... From whence art thou, O Son of Mystery? From whence art thou, Whose sire thy Mother knew not? Grief was hers, Wonder and grief, for life was in her womb, And her stern children with revengeful eyes Beheld their mother's shame. She saw their frowns, She knew their plots of blood. Where shall she look For succour, when her sons conspire her death? Where hope for comfort, when her daughter whets The impious knife of murder? . . From her womb The voice of comfort came, the timely aid: Already at her breast the blow was aim'd, When forth Mexitli leapt, and in his hand The angry spear, to punish and to save. Glory to thee, the Great, the Terrible, Mexitli, guardian God! Arise and save, Mexitli, save thy people! Dreadful one, Arise, redeem thy city, and revenge! An impious, an impenetrable foe, Hath blacken'd thine own altars, with the blood Of thine own priests; hath dash'd thine Image down. In vain did valour's naked breast oppose Their mighty arms; in vain the feeble sword On their impenetrable mail was driven. Not against thee, Avenger, shall those arms Avail, nor that impenetrable mail Resist the fiery arrows of thy wrath. Arise, go forth in anger, and destroy! XXII. THE DEATH OF LINCOYA. Aztlan, meantime, presents a hideous scene Of slaughter. The hot sunbeam, in her streets, Parch'd the blood pools; the slain were heap'd in hills; The victors, stretch'd in every little shade, With unhelm'd heads, reclining on their shields, Slept the deep sleep of weariness. Ere long, To needful labour rising, from the gates They drag the dead; and with united toil, They dig upon the plain the general grave, The grave of thousands, deep and wide and long. Ten such they delved, and o'er the multitudes Who levell'd with the plain the deep-dug pits, Ten monumental hills they heap'd on high. Next horror heightening joy, they overthrew The skull-built towers, the files of human heads, And earth to earth consign'd them. To the flames They cast the idols, and upon the wind Scatter'd their ashes; then the temples fell, Whose black and putrid walls were scaled with blood, And not one stone of those accursed piles Was on another left. Victorious thus In Aztlan, it behoved the Cymry now There to collect their strength, and there await, Or thence with centered numbers urge, the war. For this was Ririd missioned to the ships, For this Lincoya from the hills invites Erillyab and her tribe. There did not breathe, On this wide world, a happier man that day Than young Lincoya, when from their retreat He bade his countrymen come repossess The land of their forefathers; proud at heart To think how great a part himself had borne In their revenge, and that beloved one, The gentle saviour of the Prince, whom well He knew his own dear love, and for the deed Still dearer loved the dearest. Round the youth, Women and children, the infirm and old, Gather to hear his tale; and as they stood With eyes of steady wonder, outstretch'd necks, And open lips of listening eagerness, Fast play'd the tide of triumph in his veins, Flush'd his brown cheek, and kindled his dark eye. And now, reposing from his toil awhile, Lincoya, on a crag above the straits, Sate underneath a tree, whose twinkling leaves Sung to the gale at noon. Ayayaca Sate by him in the shade: the old man had loved The youth beside him from his boyhood up, And still would call him boy. They sate and watch'd The laden bisons winding down the way, The multitude who now with joy forsook Their desolated dwellings; and their talk Was of the days of sorrow, when they groan'd Beneath the intolerable yoke, till sent By the Great Spirit o'er the pathless deep, Prince Madoc the Deliverer came to save. As thus they communed, came a woman up, Seeking Lincoya; 'twas Aculhua's slave, The nurse of Coatel. Her wretched eye, Her pale and livid countenance foretold Some tale of misery, and his life-blood ebb'd In ominous fear. But when he heard her words Of death, he seized the lance, and raised his arm To strike the blow of comfort. The old man Caught his uplifted hand... O'er-hasty boy, Quoth he, regain her yet, if she was dear! Seek thy beloved in the Land of Souls, And beg her from the Gods. The Gods will hear, And in just recompense of love so true Restore their charge. The miserable youth Turned at his words a hesitating eye. I knew a prisoner, . . so the old man pursued, Or hoping to beguile the youth's despair With tales that suited the despair of youth, Or credulous himself of what he told, . . I knew a prisoner once who welcomed death With merriment and songs and joy of heart, Because, he said, the friends whom he loved best Were gone before him to the Land of Souls; Nor would they to resume their mortal state, Even when the Keeper of the Land allowed, Forsake its pleasures; therefore he rejoiced To die and join them there. I question'd him, How of these hidden things unknowable So certainly he spake. The man replied, One of our nation lost the maid he loved, Nor would he bear his sorrow, . . being one Into whose heart fear never found a way, . . But to the Country of the Dead pursued Her spirit. Many toils he underwent, And many dangers gallantly surpass'd, Till to the Country of the Dead he came. Gently the Guardian of the Land received The living suppliant; listen'd to his prayer, And gave him back the Spirit of the Maid. But from that happy country, from the songs Of joyance, from the splendour-sparkling dance, Unwillingly compell'd, the Maiden's Soul Loathed to return; and he was warn'd to guard The subtle captive well and warily, Till in her mortal tenement relodged, Earthly delights might win her to remain A sojourner on earth. Such lessoning The Ruler of the Souls departed gave; And mindful of his charge the adventurer brought His subtle captive home. There underneath The shelter of a hut, his friends had watch'd The Maiden's corpse, secured it from the sun, And fann'd away the insect swarms of heaven. A busy hand marr'd all the enterprize: Curious to see the Spirit, he unloosed The knotted bag which held her, and she fled. Lincoya, thou art brave; where man has gone Thou wouldst not fear to follow! Silently Lincoya listen'd, and with unmoved eyes; At length he answered, Is the journey long? The old man replied, A way of many moons. I know a shorter path! exclaimed the youth; And up he sprung, and from the precipice Darted: a moment, . . and Ayayaca heard His body fall upon the rocks below. XXIII. CARADOC AND SENENA. Maid of the golden locks, far other lot May gentle Heaven assign thy happier love, Blue-eyed Senena! . . She, though not as yet Had she put off her boy-habiliments, Had told Goervyl all the history Of her sad flight, and easy pardon gain'd From that sweet heart, for guile which meant no ill, And secrecy, in shame too long maintain'd. With her dear Lady now, at this still hour Of evening is the seeming page gone forth, Beside Caermadoc mere. They loitered on, Along the windings of its grassy shore, In such free interchange of inward thought As the calm hour invited; or at times, Willingly silent, listening to the bird Whose one repeated melancholy note, By oft repeating melancholy made, Solicited the ear; or gladlier now Hearkening that cheerful one, who knoweth all The songs of all the winged choristers, And in one sequence of melodious sounds Pours all their music. But a wilder strain At fits came o'er the water; rising now, Now with a dying fall, in sink and swell More exquisitely sweet than ever art Of man evoked from instrument of touch, Or beat, or breath. It was the evening gale, Which passing o'er the harp of Caradoc, Swept all its chords at once, and blended all Their music into one continuous flow. The solitary Bard beside his harp Leant underneath a tree, whose spreading boughs, With broken shade that shifted to the breeze, Play'd on the waving waters. Overhead There was the leafy murmur, at his foot The lake's perpetual ripple; and from far, Borne on the modulating gale, was heard The roaring of the mountain-cataract... A blind man would have loved the lovely spot. Here was Senena by her Lady led, Trembling, but not reluctant. They drew nigh, Their steps unheard upon the elastic moss, Till playfully Goervyl, with quick touch, Ran o'er the harp-strings. At the sudden sound He rose... Hath then thy hand, quoth she, O Bard, Forgot its cunning, that the wind should be Thine harper? . . Come! one strain for Britain's sake; And let the theme be Woman! . . He replied, But if the strain offend, O Lady fair, Blame thou the theme, not me! . . Then to the harp He sung, . . Three things a wise man will not trust, The Wind, the Sunshine of an April day, And Woman's plighted faith. I have beheld The Weathercock upon the steeple-point Steady from morn till eve; and I have seen The bees go forth upon an April morn, Secure the sunshine will not end in showers; But when was Woman true? False Bard! thereat, With smile of playful anger, she exclaim'd, False Bard! and slanderous song! Were such thy thoughts Of woman, when thy youthful lays were heard In Heilyn's hall? . . But at that name his heart Leapt, and his check with sudden flush was fired; In Heilyn's hall, quoth he, I learn'd the song. There was a Maid, who dwelt among the hills Of Arvon, and to one of humbler birth Had pledged her troth; . . nor rashly, nor beguiled, . . They had been playmates in their infancy, And she in all his thoughts had borne a part, And all his joys. The Moon and all the Stars Witness'd their mutual vows; and for her sake The song was framed; for in the face of day She broke them... But her name? Goervyl ask'd; Quoth he, The poet loved her still too well, To couple it with shame. O fate unjust Of womankind! she cried; our virtues bloom, Like violets, in shade and solitude, While evil eyes hunt all our failings out, For evil tongues to bruit abroad in jest, And song of obloquy! . . I knew a Maid, And she too dwelt in Arvon, and she too Loved one of lowly birth, who ill repaid Her spotless faith; for he to ill reports, And tales of falsehood cunningly devised, Lent a light ear, and to his rival left The loathing Maid. The wedding-day arrived, The harpers and the gleemen, far and near, Came to the wedding-feast; the wedding-guests Were come, the altar drest, the bridemaids met, The father, and the bridegroom, and the priest Wait for the bride. But she the while did off Her bridal robes, and clipt her golden locks, And put on boy's attire, through wood and wild To seek her own true love; and over sea, Forsaking all for him, she followed him, . . Nor hoping nor deserving fate so fair; And at his side she stood, and heard him wrong Her faith with slanderous tales; and his dull eye, As it had learnt his heart's forgetfulness, Knows not the trembling one, who even now Yearns to forgive him all! He turn'd, he knew The blue-eyed Maid, who fell upon his breast. XXIV. THE EMBASSY. Hark! from the towers of Aztlan how the shouts Of clamorous joy re-ring! the rocks and hills Take up the joyful sound, and o'er the lake Roll their slow echoes... Thou art beautiful, Queen of the Valley! thou art beautiful! Thy walls, like silver, sparkle to the sun; Melodious wave thy groves, thy garden-sweets Enrich the pleasant air, upon the lake Lie the long shadows of thy towers, and high In heaven thy temple-pyramids arise, Upon whose summit now, far visible Against the clear blue sky, the Cross of Christ Proclaims unto the nations round the news Of thy redemption. Thou art beautiful, Aztlan! O City of the Cymbric Prince! Long mayest thou flourish in thy beauty, long Prosper beneath the righteous conqueror, Who conquers to redeem! Long years of peace And happiness await thy Lord and thee, Queen of the Valley! Hither joyfully The Hoamen came to repossess the land Of their forefathers. Joyfully the youth Come shouting, with acclaim of grateful praise, Their great Deliverer's name; the old, in talk Of other days, which mingled with their joy Memory of many a hard calamity, And thoughts of time and change, and human life How changeful and how brief. Prince Madoc met Erillyab at the gate... Sister and Queen, Said he, here let us hold united reign, O'er our united people; by one faith, One interest bound, and closer to be link'd By laws and language and domestic ties, Till both become one race, for ever more Indissolubly knit. O friend, she cried, The last of all my family am I; Yet sure, though last, the happiest, and by Heaven Favoured abundantly above them all. Dear Friend, and brother dear! enough for me Beneath the shadow of thy shield to dwell, And see my people, by thy fostering care, Made worthy of their fortune. Graciously Hath the Beloved One appointed all, Educing good from ill, himself being good. Then to the royal palace of the Kings Of Aztlan, Madoc led Erillyab, There where her sires had held their ruder reign, To pass the happy remnant of her years, Honour'd and loved by all. Now had the Prince Provided for defence, disposing all As though a ready enemy approach'd. But from Patamba yet no army moved: Four Heralds only, by the King dispatch'd, Drew nigh the town. The Hoamen as they came Knew the green mantle of their privilege, The symbols which they bore, an arrow-point Depress'd, a shield, a net, which, from the arm Suspended, held their food. They through the gate Pass with permitted entrance, and demand To see the Ocean Prince. The Conqueror Received them, and the elder thus began: Thus to the White King, King Yuhidthiton His bidding sends; such greeting as from foe Foe may receive, where individual hate Is none, but honour and assured esteem, And what were friendship did the Gods permit, The King of Aztlan sends. Oh dream not thou That Aztlan is subdued; nor in the pride Of conquest tempt thy fortune! Unprepared For battle, at an hour of festival, Her children were surprised; and thou canst tell How perilously they maintain'd the long And doubtful strife. From yonder temple-mount Look round the plain, and count her towns, and mark Her countless villages, whose habitants All are in arms against thee! Thinkest thou To root them from the land? Or wouldst thou live, Harass'd by night and day with endless war, War at thy gates; and to thy children leave That curse for their inheritance? . . The land Is all before thee: Go in peace, and chuse Thy dwelling-place, North, South, or East, or West; Or mount again thy houses of the sea And search the waters. Whatsoe'er thy wants Demand, will Aztlan willingly supply, Prepared with friendly succour, to assist Thy soon departure. Thus Yuhidthiton, Remembering his old friendship, counsels thee; Thus, as the King of Aztlan, for himself And people, he commands. If obstinate, If blind to your own welfare, ye persist, Woe to ye, wretches! to the armed man, Who in the fight must perish; to the wife, Who vainly on her husband's aid will call; Woe to the babe that hangs upon the breast, For Aztlan comes in anger, and her Gods Spare none. The Conqueror calmly answer'd him, . . By force we won your city, Azteca; By force we will maintain it: . . to the King Repeat my saying... To this goodly land Your fathers came for an abiding place, Strangers like us, but not like us, in peace. They conquer'd and destroyed. A tyrant race, Bloody and faithless, to the hills they drove The unoffending children of the vale, And, day by day, in cruel sacrifice Consumed them. God hath sent the Avengers here! Powerful to save we come, and to destroy, When Mercy on Destruction calls for aid. Go tell your nation that we know their force, That they know ours! that their Patamba soon Shall fall like Aztlan; and what other towns They seek in flight, shall like Patamba fall: Till broken in their strength and spirit-crush'd They bow the knee, or leave the land to us, Its worthier Lords. If this be thy reply, Son of the Ocean! said the messenger, I bid thee, in the King of Aztlan's name, Mortal defiance. In the field of blood, Before our multitudes shall trample down Thy mad and miserable countrymen, Yuhidthiton invites thee to the strife Of equal danger. So may he avenge Coanocotzin, or like him in death Discharge his duty. Tell Yuhidthiton, Madoc replied, that in the field of blood I never shunn'd a foe. But say thou to him, I will not seek him there, against his life To raise the hand which hath been join'd with his In peace... With that the Heralds went their way; Nor to the right nor to the left they turn, But to Patamba straight they journey back. XXV. THE LAKE FIGHT. The mariners, meantime, at Ririd's will, Unreeve the rigging, and the masts they strike; And now ashore they haul the lighten'd hulks, Tear up the deck, the severed planks bear off, Disjoin the well-scarfed timbers, and the keel Loosen asunder: then to the lake-side Bear the materials, where the Ocean Lord Himself directs their work. Twelve vessels there, Fitted alike to catch the wind, or sweep With oars the moveless surface, they prepare; Lay down the keel, the stern-post rear, and fix The strong-curved timbers. Others from the wood Bring the tall pines, and from their hissing trunks Force, by the aid of fire, the needful gum; Beneath the close-caulk'd planks its odorous stream They pour; then, last, the round-projecting prows With iron arm, and launch, in uproar loud Of joy, anticipating victory, The galleys long and sharp. The masts are rear'd, The sails are bent, and lo! the ready barks Lie on the lake. It chanced, the Hoamen found A spy of Aztlan, and before the Prince They led him. But when Madoc bade him tell As his life-ransom, what his nation's force, And what their plans; the savage answered him, With dark and sullen eye and smile of wrath, If aught the knowledge of my country's force Could profit thee, be sure, ere I would let My tongue play traitor, thou shouldst limb from limb Hew me, and make each separate member feel A separate agony of death. O Prince! But I will tell ye of my nation's force, That ye may know and tremble at your doom; That fear may half subdue ye to the sword Of vengeance... Can ye count the stars of Heaven? The waves which ruffle o'er the lake? the leaves Swept from the autumnal forest? Can ye look Upon the eternal snows of yonder height, And number each particular flake that formed The mountain-mass? . . so numberless they come, Whoe'er can wield the sword, or hurl the lance, Or aim the arrow; from the growing boy, Ambitious of the battle, to the old man, Who to revenge his country and his Gods Hastens, and then to die. By land they come; And years must pass away ere on their path The grass again will grow: they come by lake; And ye shall see the shoals of their canoes Darken the waters. Strangers! when our Gods Have conquered, when ye lie upon the Stone Of Sacrifice extended one by one, Half of our armies cannot taste your flesh, Though given in equal shares, and every share Minced like a nestling's food! Madoc replied, Azteca, we are few; but through the woods The Lion walks alone. The lesser fowls Flock multitudinous in heaven, and fly Before the Eagle's coming. We are few; And yet thy nation hath experienced us Enough for conquest. Tell thy countrymen, We can maintain the city which we won. So saying he turn'd away, rejoiced at heart To know himself alike by lake or land Prepared to meet their power. The fateful day Draws on; by night the Aztecas embark. At day-break from Patamba they set forth, From every creek and inlet of the lake, All moving towards Aztlan; safely thus Weening to reach the plain before her walls, And fresh for battle. Shine thou forth, O Sun! Shine fairly forth upon a scene so fair! Their thousand boats, and the ten thousand oars From whose broad bowls the waters fall and flash, And twice ten thousand feathered helms, and shields, Glittering with gold and scarlet plumery. Onward they come with song and swelling horn; While, louder than all voice and instrument, The dash of their ten thousand oars, from shore To shore and hill to hill, re-echoing rolls, In undistinguishable peals of sound And endless echo. On the other side Advance the British barks; the freshening breeze Fills the broad sail, around the rushing keel The waters sing, while proudly they sail on Lords of the water. Shine thou forth, O Sun! Shine forth upon their hour of victory! Onward the Cymry speed. The Aztecas, Though wondering at that unexpected sight, Bravely made on to meet them, seized their bows, And showered, like rain, upon the pavaised barks, The rattling shafts. Strong blows the auspicious gale; Madoc, the Lord of Ocean, leads the way; He holds the helm; the galley where he guides Flies on, and full upon the first canoe Drives shattering; midway its long length it struck, And o'er the wreck with unimpeded force Dashes among the fleet. The astonished men Gaze in inactive terror. They behold Their splinter'd vessels floating all around, Their warriors struggling in the lake, with arms Experienced in the battle vainly now. Dismay'd they drop their bows, and cast away Their unavailing spears and take to flight, Before the Masters of the Elements, Who rode the waters, and who made the winds Wing them to vengeance! Forward now they bend, And backward then, with strenuous strain of arm, Press the broad paddle... Hope of victory Was none, nor of defence, nor of revenge, To sweeten death. Toward the shore they speed, Toward the shore they lift their longing eyes: . . O fools, to meet on their own element The Sons of Ocean! . . Could they but aland Set foot, the strife were equal, or to die Less dreadful. But, as if with wings of wind, On fly the British barks! . . the favouring breeze Blows strong; . . far, far, behind their roaring keels Lies the long line of foam; the helm directs Their force; they move as with the limbs of life, Obedient to the will that governs them. Where'er they pass, the crashing shock is heard, The dash of broken waters, and the cry Of sinking multitudes. Here one plies fast The practised limbs of youth, but o'er his head The galley drives; one follows a canoe With skill availing only to prolong Suffering; another, as with wiser aim He swims across, to meet his coming friends, Stunn'd by the hasty and unheeding oar, Sinks senseless to the depths. Lo! yonder boat Graspt by the thronging strugglers; its light length Yields to the overbearing weight, and all Share the same ruin. Here another shows Crueler contest, where the crew hack off The hands that hang for life upon its side, Lest all together perish; then in vain The voice of friend or kinsman prays for mercy Imperious self controuls all other thoughts; And still they deal around unnatural wounds, When the strong bark of Britain over all Sails in the path of death... God of the Lake, Tlaloc! and thou, O Aiauh, green-robed Queen! How many a wretch, in dying agonies, Invoked ye in the misery of that day! Long after, on the tainted lake, the dead Weltered; there, perch'd upon his floating prey, The vulture fed in daylight; and the wolves, Assembled at their banquet round its banks, Disturb'd the midnight with their howl of joy. XXVI. THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY. There was mourning in Patamba; the north wind Blew o'er the lake, and drifted to the shore The floating wreck and bodies of the dead. Then on the shore the mother might be seen, Seeking her child; the father to the tomb, With limbs too weak for that unhappy weight, Bearing the bloated body of his son; The wife, who, in expectant agony, Watch'd the black carcase on the coming wave. On every brow terror was legible, Anguish in every eye. There was not one Who in the general ruin did not share Peculiar grief, and in his country's loss Lament some dear one dead. Along the lake The frequent funeral-piles, for many a day, With the noon-light their melancholy flames Dimly commingled; while the mourners stood, Watching the pile, to feed the lingering fire, As slowly it consumed the watery corpse. Thou didst not fear, young Tlalala! thy soul, Unconquered and unconquerable, rose Superior to its fortune. When the Chiefs Hung their dejected heads, as men subdued In spirit, then didst thou, Yuhidthiton, Calm in the hour of evil, still maintain Thy even courage. They from man to man Go, with the mourners mourning, and by grief Exciting rage, till, at the promised fight, The hope of vengeance, a ferocious joy Flash'd in the eyes which glisten'd still with tears Of tender memory. to the brave they spake Of Aztlan's strength, . . for Aztlan still was strong: . . The late defeat, . . not there by manly might, By honourable valour, by the force Of arms subdued, shame aggravated loss; The White Men from the waters came, perchance Sons of the Ocean, by their parent Gods Aided, and conquerors not by human skill. When man met man, when in the field of fight The soldier on firm earth should plant his foot, Then would the trial be, the struggle then, The glory, the revenge. Tezozomoc, Alike unbroken by defeat, endured The evil day; but in his sullen mind Work'd thoughts of other vengeance. He the King Summon'd apart from all, with Tlalala, And thus advised them: We have vainly tried The war; these mighty Strangers will not yield To mortal strength; yet shall they be cut off So ye will heed my counsel, and to force Add wisdom's aid. Put on a friendly front; Send to their Prince the messenger of peace; He will believe our words; he will forgive The past; . . the offender may. So days and months, Yea, years, if needful, will we wear a face Of friendliness, till some fit hour arrive, When we may fire their dwellings in the night, Or mingle poison in their cups of mirth. The warrior, from whose force the Lion flies, Falls by the Serpent's tooth. Thou speakest well, Tlalala answer'd; but my spirit ill Can brook revenge delay'd. The Priest then turn'd His small and glittering eye toward the King; But on the Monarch's mild and manly brow A meaning sate, which made that crafty eye Bend, quickly abash'd. While yet I was a child, Replied the King of Aztlan, on my heart My father laid two precepts. Boy, be brave! So, in the midnight battle, shalt thou meet, Fearless, the sudden foe. Boy, let thy lips Be clean from falsehood! in the mid-day sun, So never shalt thou need from mortal man To turn thy guilty face. Tezozomoc, Holy I keep the lessons of my sire. But if the enemy, with their dreadful arms, Again, said Tlalala, . . If again the Gods Will our defeat, Yuhidthiton replied, Vain is it for the feeble power of man To strive against their will. I augure not Of ill, young Tyger! but if ill betide, The land is all before us. Let me hear Of perfidy and serpent-wiles no more! In the noon-day war, and in the face of Heaven, I meet my foes. Let Aztlan follow me; And if one man of all her multitudes Shall better play the warrior in that hour, Be his the sceptre! But if the people fear The perilous strife, and own themselves subdued, Let us depart! The universal Sun Confines not to one land his partial beams; Nor is man rooted, like a tree, whose seed The winds on some ungenial soil have cast, There where he cannot prosper. The dark Priest Conceal'd revengeful anger, and replied, Let the King's will be done! An aweful day Draws on; the Circle of the Years is full; We tremble for the event. The times are strange; There are portentous changes in the world; Perchance its end is come. Be it thy care, Priest of the Gods, to see the needful rites Duly perform'd, Yuhidthiton replied. On the third day, if yonder Lord of Light Begin the Circle of the Years anew, Again we march to war. One day is past; Another day comes on. At earliest dawn Then was there heard through all Patamba's streets The warning voice, . . Woe! woe! the Sun hath reach'd The limits of his course; he hath fulfill'd The appointed cycle! . . Fast, and weep, and pray, . . Four Suns have perish'd, . . fast, and weep, and pray, Lest the fifth perish also. On the first The floods arose; the waters of the heavens, Bursting their everlasting boundaries, Whelm'd in one deluge earth and sea and sky, And quench'd its orb of fire. The second Sun Then had its birth, and ran its round of years; Till having reach'd its date, it fell from heaven, And crush'd the race of men. Another life The Gods assign'd to Nature; the third Sun Form'd the celestial circle; then its flames Burst forth, and overspread earth, sea, and sky, Deluging the wide universe with fire, Till all things were consumed, and its own flames Fed on itself, and spent themselves, and all Was vacancy and darkness. Yet again The World had being, and another Sun Roll'd round the path of Heaven. That perish'd too: The mighty Whirlwinds rose, and far away Scattered its dying flames. The fifth was born; The fifth to-day completes its destined course, Perchance to rise no more. O Aztlan, fast And pray! the Cycle of the Years is full! Thus through Patamba did the ominous voice Exhort the people. Fervent vows all day Were made, with loud lament; in every fane, In every dwelling-place of man, were prayers, The supplications of the affrighted heart, Earnestly offered up with tears and groans. So past the forenoon; and when now the Sun Sloped from his southern height the downward way Of Heaven, again the ominous warner cried, Woe! woe! the Cycle of the Years is full! Quench every fire! Extinguish every light! And every fire was quench'd, and every light Extinguish'd at the voice. Meantime the Priests Began the rites. They gash'd themselves, and plunged Into the sacred pond of Ezapan, Till the clear water, on whose bed of sand The sunbeams sparkled late, opaque with blood, On its black surface mirror'd all things round. The children of the temple, in long search, Had gather'd for the service of this day, All venomous things that fly, or wind their path With sinuous trail, or crawl on reptile feet. These in one cauldron, o'er the sacred fire They scorch, till of the loathsome living tribes, Who, writhing in their burning agonies, Fix on each other ill-directed wounds, Ashes alone are left. In infants' blood They mix the infernal unction, and the Priests Anoint themselves therewith. Lo! from the South The Orb of Glory his regardless way Holds on. Again Patamba's streets receive The ominous voice, . . Woe! woe! the Sun pursues His journey to the limits of his course! Let every man in darkness veil his wife; Veil every maiden's face; let every child Be hid in darkness, there to weep and pray, That they may see again the birth of light! They heard, and every husband veil'd his wife In darkness; every maiden's face was veil'd; The children were in darkness led to pray, That they might see the birth of light once more. Westward the Sun proceeds; the tall tree casts A longer shade; the night-eyed insect tribes Wake to their portion of the circling hours; The water-fowl, retiring to the shore, Sweep in long files the surface of the lake. Then from Patamba to the sacred mount The Priests go forth; but not with songs of joy, Nor cheerful instruments they go, nor train Of festive followers; silent and alone, Leading one victim to his dreadful death, They to the mountain-summit wend their way. On the south shore, and level with the lake, Patamba stood; westward were seen the walls Of Aztlan rising on a gentle slope; Southward the plain extended far and wide; To the east the mountain-boundary began, And there the sacred mountain rear'd its head; Above the neighbouring heights, its lofty peak Was visible far off. In the vale below, Along the level borders of the lake, The assembled Aztecas, with wistful eye, Gaze on the sacred summit, hoping there Soon to behold the fire of sacrifice Arise, sure omen of continued light. The Pabas to the sacred peak begin Their way, and as they go, with ancient songs Hymn the departed Sun. O Light of Life Yet once again arise! yet once again Commence thy course of glory! Time hath seen Four generations of mankind destroy'd, When the four Suns expired; oh, let not thou, Human thyself of yore, the human race Languish and die in darkness! The fourth Sun Had perish'd; for the mighty Whirlwinds rose, And swept it, with the dust of the shatter'd world, Into the great abyss. The eternal Gods Built a new World, and to a Hero race Assign'd it for their goodly dwelling-place; And shedding on the bones of the destroy'd A quickening dew, from them, as from a seed, Made a new race of human-kind spring up, The menials of the Heroes born of Heaven. But in the firmament no orb of day Perform'd its course; Nature was blind; the fount Of light had ceased to flow; the eye of Heaven Was quench'd in darkness. In the sad obscure, The earth-possessors to their parent Gods Pray'd for another Sun, their bidding heard, And in obedience raised a flaming pile. Hopeful they circled it, when from above The voice of the Invisible proclaim'd, That he who bravely plunged amid the fire Should live again in heaven, and there shine forth The Sun of the young World. The Hero race Grew pale, and from the fiery trial shrunk. Thou, Nahuaztin, thou, O mortal born, Heardest! thy heart was strong, the flames received Their victim, and the humbled Heroes saw The orient sky, with smiles of rosy joy, Welcome the coming of the new-born God. O human once, now let not human-kind Languish, and die in darkness! In the East Then didst thou pause to see the Hero race Perish. In vain, with impious arms, they strove Against thy will; in vain against thine orb They shot their shafts; the arrows of their pride Fell on themselves; they perish'd, to thy praise. So perish still thine impious enemies, O Lord of Day! But to the race devout, Who offer up their morning sacrifice, Honouring thy godhead, and with morning hymns, And with the joy of music and of dance, Welcome thy glad uprise, . . to them, O Sun, Still let the fountain-streams of splendour flow, Still smile on them propitious, thou whose smile Is light and life and joyance! Once again, Parent of Being, Prince of Glory, rise, Begin thy course of beauty once again! Such was their ancient song, as up the height Slowly they wound their way. The multitude Beneath repeat the strain; with fearful eyes They watch the spreading glories of the west! And when at length the hastening orb hath sunk Below the plain, such sinking at the heart They feel, as he who hopeless of return From his dear home departs. Still on the light, The last green light that lingers in the west, Their looks are fasten d, till the clouds of night Roll on, and close in darkness the whole heaven. Then ceased their songs; then o'er the crowded vale No voice of man was heard. Silent and still They stood, all turn'd toward the east, in hope There on the holy mountain to behold The sacred fire, and know that once again The Sun begins his stated round of years. The Moon arose; she shone upon the lake, Which lay one smooth expanse of silver light; She shone upon the hills and rocks, and cast Upon their hollows and their hidden glens A blacker depth of shade. Who then look'd round, Beholding all that mighty multitude, Felt yet severer awe, . . so solemnly still The thronging thousandsstood. The breeze was heard That rustled in the reeds; the little wave, That rippled to the shore and left no foam, Sent its low murmurs far. Meantime the Priests Have stretch'd their victim on the mountain-top; A miserable man, his breast is bare, Bare for the death that waits him; but no hand May there inflict the blow of mercy. Piled On his bare breast, the cedar boughs are laid; On his bare breast, dry sedge and odorous gums Laid ready to receive the sacred spark, And blaze, to herald the ascending Sun, Upon his living altar. Round the wretch The inhuman ministers of rites accurst Stand, and expect the signal when to strike The seed of fire. Their Chief, Tezozomoc, Apart from all, upon the pinnacle Of that high mountain, eastward turns his eyes; For now the hour draws nigh, and speedily He looks to see the first faint dawn of day Break through the orient sky. Impatiently The multitude await the happy sign. Long hath the midnight past, and every hour, Yea every moment, to their torturing fears Seem'd lengthen'd out, insufferably long. Silent they stood, and breathless in suspense. The breeze had fallen; no stirring breath of wind Rustled the reeds. Oppressive, motionless, It was a labour and a pain to breathe The close, hot, heavy air... Hark! from the woods The howl of their wild tenants! and the birds, . . The day-birds, in blind darkness fluttering, Fearful to rest, uttering portentous cries! Anon, the sound of distant thunders came; They peal beneath their feet. Earth shakes and yawns, . . And lo! upon the sacred mountain's top, The light.. the mighty flame! A cataract Of fire bursts upward from the mountain-head, . . High, . . high, . . it shoots! the liquid fire boils out; It streams in torrents down! Tezozomoc Beholds the judgement: wretched, . . wretched man, On the upmost pinnacle he stands, and sees The lava floods beneath him: and his hour Is come. The fiery shower, descending, heaps Red ashes round; they fall like drifted snows, And bury and consume the accursed Priest. The Tempest is abroad. Fierce from the North A wind uptears the lake, whose lowest depths Rock, while convulsions shake the solid earth. Where is Patamba? where the multitudes Who throng'd her level shores? The mighty Lake Hath burst its bounds, and yon wide valley roars, A troubled sea, before the rolling storm. XXVII. THE MIGRATION OF THE AZTECAS. The storm hath ceased; but still the lava-tides Roll down the mountain-side in streams of fire; Down to the lake they roll, and yet roll on, All burning, through the waters. Heaven above Glows round the burning mount, and fiery clouds Scour through the black and starless firmament. Far off, the Eagle, in her mountain-nest, Lies watching in alarm, with steady eye, The midnight radiance. But the storm hath ceased; The earth is still; . . and lo! while yet the dawn Is struggling through the eastern cloud, the barks Of Madoc on the lake! What man is he On yonder crag, all dripping from the flood Who hath escaped its force? He lies along, Now near exhaust with self-preserving toil, And still his eye dwells on the spreading waves, Where late the multitudes of Aztlan stood, Collected in their strength. It is the King Of Aztlan, who, extended on the rock, Looks vainly for his people. He beholds The barks of Madoc plying to preserve The strugglers; . . but how few! upon the crags Which verge the northern shore, upon the heights Eastward, how few have refuged! Then the King Almost repented him of life preserved, And wished the waves had whelmed him, or the sword Fallen on him, ere this ill, this wretchedness, This desolation. Spirit-troubled thus, He call'd to mind how, from the first, his heart Inclined to peace, and how reluctantly, Obedient to the Pabas and their Gods, Had he to this unhappy war been driven. All now was ended: it remain'd to yield, To obey the inevitable will of Heaven, From Aztlan to depart. As thus he mused, A Bird, upon a bough which overhung The rock, as though in echo to his thought, Cried out, . . Depart! depart! for so the note, Articulately in his native tongue, Spake to the Azteca. The King look'd up; The hour, the horrors round him, had impress'd Feelings and fears well fitted to receive All superstition; and the voice which cried, Depart! depart! seem'd like the voice of fate. He thought, perhaps Coanocotzin's soul, Descending from his blissful halls in the hour Of evil thus to comfort and advise, Hover'd above him. Lo! toward the rock, Oaring with feeble arms his difficult way, A warrior struggles: he hath reach'd the rock, Hath graspt it, but his strength, exhausted, fails To lift him from the depth. The King descends Timely in aid; he holds the feeble one By his long locks, and on the safety-place Lands him. He, panting, from his clotted hair Shook the thick waters, from his forehead wiped The blinding drops; on his preserver's face Then look'd, and knew the King. Then Tlalala Fell on his neck, and groan'd. They laid them down In silence, for their hearts were full of woe. The sun came forth, it shone upon the rock; They felt the kindly beams; their strengthen'd blood Flow'd with a freer action. They arose, And look'd around, if aught of hope might meet Their prospect. On the lake the galleys plied Their toil successfully, ever to the shore Bearing their rescued charge: the eastern heights, Rightward and leftward of the fiery mount, Were throng'd with fugitives, whose growing crowds Speckled the ascent. Then Tlalala took hope, And his young heart, reviving, re-assumed Its wonted vigour. Let us to the heights, He cried; . . all is not lost, Yuhidthiton! When they behold thy countenance, the sight Will cheer them in their woe, and they will bless The Gods of Aztlan. To the heights they went; And when the remnant of the people saw Yuhidthiton preserved, such comfort then They felt, as utter wretchedness can feel, That only gives grief utterance, only speaks In groans and recollections of the past He look'd around; a multitude was there, . . But where the strength of Aztlan? where her hosts? Her marshall'd myriads where, whom yester Sun Had seen in arms array'd, in spirit high, Mighty in youth and courage? . . What were these, This remnant of the people? Women most, Who from Patamba when the shock began Ran with their infants; widow'd now, yet each Among the few who from the lake escaped, Wandering, with eager eyes and wretched hope. The King beheld and groan'd; against a tree He leant, and bow'd his head, subdued of soul. Meantime, amid the crowd, doth Tlalala Seek for his wife and boy. In vain he seeks Ilanquel there; in vain for her he asks; A troubled look, a melancholy eye, A silent motion of the hopeless head, These answer him. But Tlalala represt His anguish, and he call'd upon the King; . . Yuhidthiton! thou seest thy people left; Their fate must be determined; they are here Houseless, and wanting food. The King look'd up, . . It is determined, Tlalala! the Gods Have crush'd us. Who can stand against their wrath? Have we not life and strength? the Tyger cried. Disperse these women to the towns which stand Beyond the ruinous waters; against them The White Men will not war. Ourselves are few, Too few to root the invaders from our land, Or meet them with the hope of equal fight; Yet may we shelter in the woods, and share The Lion's liberty; and man by man Destroy them, till they shall not dare to walk Beyond their city walls, to sow their fields, Or bring the harvest in. We may steal forth In the dark midnight, go and burn and kill, Till all their dreams shall be of fire and death, Their sleep be fear and misery. Then the King Stretch'd forth his hand, and pointed to the lake Where Madoc's galleys still to those who clung To the tree-tops for life, or faintly still Were floating on the waters, gave their aid... O think not, Tlalala, that ever more Will I against those noble enemies Raise my right hand in war, lest righteous Heaven Should blast the impious hand and thankless heart! The Gods are leagued with them; the Elements Banded against us! For our overthrow Were yonder mountain-springs of fire ordain'd; For our destruction the earth-thunders loosed, And the everlasting boundaries of the lake Gave way, that these destroying floods might roll Over the brave of Aztlan! . . We must leave The country which our fathers won in arms; We must depart. The word yet vibrated Fresh on their hearing, when the Bird above, Flapping his heavy wings, repeats the sound, Depart! depart! . . Ye hear! the King exclaim'd; It is an omen sent to me from Heaven; I heard it late in solitude, the voice Of fate... It is Coanocotzin's soul, Who counsels our departure... And the Bird Still flew around, and in his wheeling flight Pronounced the articulate note. The people heard In faith, and Tlalala made no reply; But dark his brow, and gloomy was his frown. Then spake the King, and called a messenger, And bade him speed to Aztlan... Seek the Lord Of Ocean; tell him that Yuhidthiton Yields to the will of Heaven, and leaves the land His fathers won in war. Only one boon In memory of our former friendship, ask, The Ashes of my Fathers, . . if indeed The conqueror have not cast them to the winds. The herald went his way circuitous, Along the mountains, . . for the flooded vale Barr'd the near passage: but before his feet Could traverse half their track, the fugitives Beheld canoes from Aztlan, to the foot Of that protecting eminence, whereon They had their stand, draw nigh. The doubtful sight Disturb'd them, lest perchance with hostile strength They came upon their weakness. Wrongful fear, . . For now Cadwallon, from his bark unarm'd. Set foot ashore, and for Yuhidthiton Enquired, if yet he lived? The King receives His former friend... From Madoc come I here, The Briton said: Raiment and food he sends, And peace; so shall this visitation prove A blessing, if it knit the bonds of peace, And make us as one people. Tlalala! Hearest thou him? Yuhidthiton exclaim'd. Do thou thy pleasure, King! the Tyger cried: My path is plain... Thereat Yuhidthiton, Answering, replied, Thus humbled as thou seest, Beneath the visitation of the Gods, We bow before their will! To them we yield; To you their favourites, we resign the land, Our fathers conquer'd. Never more may Fate In your days or your children's, to the end Of time afflict it thus! He said, and call'd The Heralds of his pleasure... Go ye forth Throughout the land: North, south, and east, and west, Proclaim the ruin. Say to all who bear The name of Azteca, Heaven hath destroy'd Our nation: Say, the voice of Heaven was heard, . . Heard ye it not? . . bidding us leave the land, Who shakes us from her bosom. Ye will find Women, old men, and babes; the many, weak Of body and of spirit ill prepared, With painful toil, through long and dangerous ways To seek another country. Say to them, The White Men will not lift the arm of power Against the feeble; here they may remain In peace, and to the grave in peace go down. But they who would not have their children lose The name their fathers bore, will join our march. Ere ye set forth, behold the destined way. He bade a pile be raised upon the top Of that high eminence, to all the winds Exposed. They raised the pile, and left it free To all the winds of Heaven; Yuhidthiton Alone approach'd it, and applied the torch. The day was calm, and o'er the flaming pile The wavy smoke hung lingering, like a mist That in the morning tracks the valley-stream. Swell over swell it rose, erect above, On all sides spreading like a stately palm. So moveless were the winds. Upward it roll'd, Still upward, when a stream of upper air Cross'd it, and bent its top, and drove it on, Straight over Aztlan. An acclaiming shout Welcomed the will of Heaven; for lo, the smoke Fast travelling on, while not a breath of air Is felt below. Ye see the appointed course; Exclaim'd the King. Proclaim it where ye go! On the third morning we begin our march. Soon o'er the lake a winged galley sped, Wafting the Ocean Prince. He bore, preserved When Aztlan's bloody temples were cast down, The Ashes of the Dead. The King received The relics, and his heart was full; his eye Dwelt on his father's urn. At length he said, One more request, O Madoc! . . If the lake Should ever to its ancient bounds return, Shrined in the highest of Patamba's towers Coanocotzin rests... But wherefore this? Thou wilt respect the ashes of the King. Then Madoc said, Abide not here, O King, Thus open to the changeful elements; But till the day of your departure come, Sojourn with me... Madoc, that must not be! Yuhidthiton replied. Shall I behold A stranger dwelling in my father's house? Shall I become a guest, where I was wont To give the guest his welcome? . . He pursued, After short pause of speech, . . For our old men, And helpless babes and women; for all those Whom wisely fear and feebleness deter To tempt strange paths, through swamp and wilderness And hostile tribes, for these Yuhidthiton Intreats thy favour. Underneath thy sway, They may remember me without regret, Yet not without affection... They shall be My people, Madoc answer'd... And the rites Of holiness transmitted from their sires, . . Pursued the King, . . will these be suffer'd them? . . Blood must not flow, the Christian Prince replied; No Priest must dwell among us; that hath been The cause of all this misery! . . Enough, Yuhidthiton replied; I ask no more. It is not for the conquered to impose Their law upon the conqueror. Then he turn'd. And lifted up his voice, and call'd upon The people: . . All whom fear or feebleness Withhold from following my adventurous path, Prince Madoc will receive. No blood must flow, No Paba dwell among them. Take upon ye, Ye who are weak of body or of heart, The Strangers' easy yoke: beneath their sway Ye may remember me without regret. Soon take your choice, and speedily depart, Lest ye impede the adventurers... As he spake, Tears flow'd, and groans were heard. The line was drawn, Which whoso would accept the Strangers' yoke Should pass. A multitude o'erpast the line; But all the youth of Aztlan crowded round Yuhidthiton, their own beloved King. So two days long, with unremitting toil, The barks of Britain to the adventurers Bore due supply; and to new habitants The city of the Cymry spread her gates; And in the vale around, and on the heights, Their numerous tents were pitch'd. Meantime the tale Of ruin went abroad, and how the Gods Had driven her sons from Aztlan. To the King, Companions of his venturous enterprize, The bold repair'd; the timid and the weak, All whom, averse from perilous wanderings, A gentler nature had disposed to peace, Beneath the Strangers' easy rule remain'd. Now the third morning came. At break of day The mountain echoes to the busy sound Of multitudes. Before the moving tribe The Pabas bear, enclosed from public sight, Mexitli; and the ashes of the Kings Follow the Chair of God. Yuhidthiton Then leads the marshall'd ranks, and by his side, Silent and thoughtfully, went Tlalala. At the north gate of Aztlan, Malinal, Borne in a litter, waited their approach; And now alighting, as the train drew nigh, Propt by a friendly arm, with feeble step Advanced to meet the King. Yuhidthiton, With eye severe and darkening countenance, Met his advance. I did not think, quoth he, Thou wouldst have ventured this! and liefer far Should I have borne away with me the thought That Malinal had shunn'd his brother's sight, Because their common blood yet raised in him A sense of his own shame! . . Comest thou to show Those wounds, the marks of thine unnatural war Against thy country? Or to boast the meed Of thy dishonour, that thou tarriest here, Sharing the bounty of the Conqueror, While, with the remnant of his countrymen, Saving the Gods of Aztlan and the name, Thy brother and thy King goes forth to seek His fortune! Calm and low the youth replied, Ill dost thou judge of me, Yuhidthiton! And rashly doth my brother wrong the heart He better should have known! Howbeit, I come Prepared for grief. These honourable wounds Were gain'd when, singly, at Caermadoc, I Opposed the ruffian Hoamen; and even now, Thus feeble as thou seest me, come I thence, For this farewell. Brother, . . Yuhidthiton, . . By the true love which thou didst bear my youth, Which ever, with a love as true, my heart Hath answer'd, . . by the memory of that hour When at our mother's funeral pile we stood, Go not away in wrath, but call to mind What thou hast ever known me! Side by side We fought against the Strangers, side by side We fell; together in the council-hall We counsell'd peace, together in the field Of the assembly pledged the word of peace. When plots of secret slaughter were devised, I raised my voice alone, alone I kept My plighted faith, alone I prophesied The judgement of just Heaven; for this I bore Reproach and shame and wrongful banishment, In the action self-approved, and justified By this unhappy issue. As he spake, Did natural feeling strive within the King, And thoughts of other days, and brotherly love, And inward consciousness that had he too Stood forth, obedient to his better mind, Nor weakly yielded to the wily priests, Wilfully blind, perchance even now in peace The kingdom of his fathers had preserved Her name and empire... Malinal, he cried Thy brother's heart is sore; in better times I may with kindlier thoughts remember thee, And honour thy true virtue. Now fare well! So saying, to his heart he held the youth, Then turn'd away. But then cried Tlalala, Farewell, Yuhidthiton! the Tyger cried; For I too will not leave my native land, . . Thou who wert King of Aztlan! Go thy way; And be it prosperous. Through the gate thou seest Yon tree that overhangs my father's house; My father lies beneath it. Call to mind Sometimes that tree; for at its foot in peace Shall Tlalala be laid, who will not live Survivor of his country. Thus he said, And through the gate, regardless of the King, Turn'd to his native door. Yuhidthiton Follow'd, and Madoc; but in vain their words Essay'd to move the Tyger's steady heart; When from the door a tottering boy came forth And clung around his knees with joyful cries, And called him father. At the joyful sound Out ran Ilanquel; and the astonish'd man Beheld his wife and boy, whom sure he deem'd Whelm'd in the flood; but them the British barks, Returning homeward from their merciful quest, Found floating on the waters... For a while, Abandoned by all desperate thoughts he stood: Soon he collected, and to Madoc turn'd, And said, O Prince, this woman and her boy I leave to thee. As thou hast ever found In me a fearless unrelenting foe, Fighting with ceaseless zeal his country's cause, Respect them! . . Nay, Ilanquel! hast thou yet To learn with what unshakeable resolve My soul maintains its purposes? I leave thee To a brave foe's protection... Lay me, Madoc, Here, in my father's grave. With that he took His mantle off, and veil'd Ilanquel's face; . . Woman, thou may'st not look upon the Sun, Who sets to rise no more! . . That done, he placed His javelin-hilt against the ground; the point He fitted to his heart; and, holding firm The shaft, fell forward, still with steady hand Guiding the death-blow on. So in the land Madoc was left sole Lord; and far away Yuhidthiton led forth the Aztecas, To spread in other lands Mexitli's name, And rear a mightier empire, and set up Again their foul idolatry; till Heaven, Making blind Zeal and bloody Avarice Its ministers of vengeance, sent among them The heroic Spaniard's unrelenting sword.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. VI. MARY, THE MAID OF THE INN. 1 Who is yonder poor Maniac, whose wildly-fix'd eyes Seem a heart overcharged to express? She weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs; She never complains, but her silence implies The composure of settled distress. 2 No pity she looks for, no alms doth she seek; Nor for raiment nor food doth she care: Through her tatters the winds of the winter blow bleak On that wither'd breast, and her weather-worn cheek Hath the hue of a mortal despair. 3 Yet cheerful and happy, nor distant the day, Poor Mary the Maniac hath been; The Traveller remembers who journey'd this way No damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay, As Mary, the Maid of the Inn. 4 Her cheerful address fill'd the guests with delight As she welcomed them in with a smile; Her heart was a stranger to childish affright, And Mary would walk by the Abbey at night When the wind whistled down the dark aisle. 5 She loved, and young Richard had settled the day, And she hoped to be happy for life: But Richard was idle and worthless, and they Who knew him would pity poor Mary, and say That she was too good for his wife. 6 'Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night, And fast were the windows and door; Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright, And smoking in silence with tranquil delight They listen'd to hear the wind roar. 7 “'Tis pleasant,” cried one, “seated by the fire-side, To hear the wind whistle without.” “What a night for the Abbey!” his comrade replied, “Methinks a man's courage would now be well tried Who should wander the ruins about. 8 “I myself, like a school-boy, should tremble to hear The hoarse ivy shake over my head; And could fancy I saw, half persuaded by fear, Some ugly old Abbot's grim spirit appear, For this wind might awaken the dead!” 9 “I'll wager a dinner,” the other one cried, “That Mary would venture there now.” “Then wager and lose!” with a sneer he replied, “I'll warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side, And faint if she saw a white cow.” 10 “Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?” His companion exclaim'd with a smile; “I shall win, . . for I know she will venture there now, And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough From the elder that grows in the aisle.” 11 With fearless good-humour did Mary comply, And her way to the Abbey she bent; The night was dark, and the wind was high, And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky, She shiver'd with cold as she went. 12 O'er the path so well known still proceeded the Maid Where the Abbey rose dim on the sight; Through the gateway she enter'd, she felt not afraid, Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade Seem'd to deepen the gloom of the night. 13 All around her was silent, save when the rude blast Howl'd dismally round the old pile; Over weed-cover'd fragments she fearlessly pass'd, And arrived at the innermost ruin at last Where the elder-tree grew in the aisle. 14 Well pleased did she reach it, and quickly drew near, And hastily gather'd the bough; When the sound of a voice seem'd to rise on her ear, She paused, and she listen'd intently, in fear, And her heart panted painfully now. 15 The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head, She listen'd.. nought else could she hear; The wind fell; her heart sunk in her bosom with dread, For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread Of footsteps approaching her near. 16 Behind a wide column half breathless with fear She crept to conceal herself there: That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear, And she saw in the moonlight two ruffians appear, And between them a corpse did they bear. 17 Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold; Again the rough wind hurried by, . . It blew off the hat of the one, and behold Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd, . . She felt, and expected to die. 18 “Curse the hat!” he exclaims; “Nay, come on till we hide “The dead body,” his comrade replies. She beholds them in safety pass on by her side, She seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied, And fast through the Abbey she flies. 19 She ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door, She gaz'd in her terror around, Then her limbs could support their faint burthen no more, And exhausted and breathless she sank on the floor, Unable to utter a sound. 20 Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart, For a moment the hat met her view; . . Her eyes from that object convulsively start, For.. what a cold horror then thrilled through her heart When the name of her Richard she knew! 21 Where the old Abbey stands, on the common hard by, His gibbet is now to be seen; His irons you still from the road may espy; The traveller beholds them, and thinks with a sigh Of poor Mary, the Maid of the Inn. Bristol, 1796. DONICA. High on a rock whose castled shade Darken'd the lake below, In ancient strength majestic stood The towers of Arlinkow. The fisher in the lake below Durst never cast his net, Nor ever swallow in its waves Her passing wing would wet. The cattle from its ominous banks In wild alarm would run, Though parch'd with thirst, and faint beneath The summer's scorching sun. For sometimes when no passing breeze The long lank sedges waved, All white with foam and heaving high Its deafening billows raved. And when the tempest from its base The rooted pine would shake, The powerless storm unruffling swept Across the calm dead lake. And ever then when death drew near The house of Arlinkow, Its dark unfathom'd waters sent Strange music from below. The Lord of Arlinkow was old, One only child had he, Donica was the Maiden's name, As fair as fair might be. A bloom as bright as opening morn Suffused her clear white cheek; The music of her voice was mild, Her full dark eyes were meek. Far was her beauty known, for none So fair could Finland boast; Her parents loved the Maiden much, Young Eberhard loved her most. Together did they hope to tread The pleasant path of life, For now the day drew near to make Donica Eberhard's wife. The eve was fair and mild the air, Along the lake they stray; The eastern hill reflected bright The tints of fading day. And brightly o'er the water stream'd The liquid radiance wide; Donica's little dog ran on And gamboll'd at her side. Youth, health, and love bloom'd on her cheek, Her full dark eyes express In many a glance to Eberhard Her soul's meek tenderness. Nor sound was heard, nor passing gale Sigh'd through the long lank sedge; The air was hush'd, no little wave Dimpled the water's edge: When suddenly the lake sent forth Its music from beneath, And slowly o'er the waters sail'd The solemn sounds of death. As those deep sounds of death arose, Donica's cheek grew pale, And in the arms of Eberhard The lifeless Maiden fell. Loudly the Youth in terror shriek'd, And loud he call'd for aid, And with a wild and eager look Gazed on the lifeless Maid. But soon again did better thoughts In Eberhard arise, And he with trembling hope beheld The Maiden raise her eyes. And on his arm reclined she moved With feeble pace and slow, And soon with strength recover'd reach'd The towers of Arlinkow. Yet never to Donica's cheeks Return'd their lively hue; Her cheeks were deathy white and wan, Her lips a livid blue; Her eyes so bright and black of yore Were now more black and bright, And beam'd strange lustre in her face So deadly wan and white. The dog that gamboll'd by her side, And loved with her to stray, Now at his alter'd mistress howl'd, And fled in fear away. Yet did the faithful Eberhard Not love the Maid the less; He gazed with sorrow, but he gazed With deeper tenderness. And when he found her health unharm'd He would not brook delay, But press'd the not unwilling Maid To fix the bridal day. And when at length it came, with joy He hail'd the bridal day, And onward to the house of God They went their willing way. But when they at the altar stood, And heard the sacred rite, The hallow'd tapers dimly stream'd A pale sulphureous light. And when the Youth with holy warmth Her hand in his did hold, Sudden he felt Donica's hand Grow deadly damp and cold. But loudly then he shriek'd, for lo! A Spirit met his view, And Eberhard in the angel form His own Donica knew. That instant from her earthly frame A Dæmon howling fled, And at the side of Eberhard The livid corpse fell dead. Bristol, 1796 RUDIGER. Bright on the mountain's heathy slope The day's last splendours shine, And rich with many a radiant hue, Gleam gaily on the Rhine. And many a one from Waldhurst's walls Along the river stroll'd, As ruffiing o'er the pleasant stream The evening gales came cold. So as they stray'd a swan they saw Sail stately up and strong, And by a silver chain he drew A little boat along. Whose streamer to the gentle breeze Long floating flutter'd light; Beneath whose crimson canopy There lay reclined a knight. With arching crest and swelling breast On sail'd the stately swan, And lightly up the parting tide The little boat came on. And onward to the shore they drew, Where having left the knight, The little boat adown the stream Fell soon beyond the sight. Was never a knight in Waldhursts walls Could with this stranger vie, Was never a youth at aught esteem'd When Rudiger was by. Was never a maid in Waldhurst's walls Might match with Margaret; Her cheek was fair, her eyes were dark, Her silken locks like jet. And many a rich and noble youth Had sought to win the fair, But never a rich and noble youth Could rival Rudiger. At every tilt and tourney he Still bore away the prize; For knightly feats superior still, And knightly courtesies. His gallant feats, his looks, his love, Soon won the willing fair; And soon did Margaret become The wife of Rudiger. Like morning dreams of happiness Fast roll'd the months away; For he was kind and she was kind, And who so blest as they? Yet Rudiger would sometimes sit Absorb'd in silent thought, And his dark downward eye would seem With anxious meaning fraught: But soon he raised his looks again, And smiled his cares away, And mid the hall of gaiety Was none like him so gay. And onward roll'd the waning months, The hour appointed came, And Margaret her Rudiger Hail'd with a father's name. But silently did Rudiger The little infant see; And darkly on the babe he gazed, A gloomy man was he. And when to bless the little babe The holy Father came, To cleanse the stains of sin away In Christ's redeeming name, Then did the cheek of Rudiger Assume a death-pale hue, And on his clammy forehead stood The cold convulsive dew; And faltering in his speech he bade The Priest the rites delay, Till he could, to right health restored, Enjoy the festive day. When o'er the many-tinted sky He saw the day decline, He called upon his Margaret To walk beside the Rhine; “And we will take the little babe, For soft the breeze that blows, And the mild murmurs of the stream Will lull him to repose.” And so together forth they went, The evening breeze was mild, And Rudiger upon his arm Pillow'd the little child. Many gay companies that eve Along the river roam, But when the mist began to rise, They all betook them home. Yet Rudiger continued still Along the banks to roam, Nor aught could Margaret prevail To turn his footsteps home. “Oh turn thee, turn thee, Rudiger! The rising mists behold, The evening wind is damp and chill, The little babe is cold!” “Now hush thee, hush thee, Margaret, The mists will do no harm, And from the wind the little babe Is shelter'd on my arm.” “Oh turn thee, turn thee, Rudiger! Why onward wilt thou roam? The moon is up, the night is cold, And we are far from home.” He answer'd not; for now he saw A Swan come sailing strong, And by a silver chain he drew A little boat along. To shore they came, and to the boat Fast leapt he with the child, And in leapt Margaret.. breathless now, And pale with fear, and wild. With arching crest and swelling breast On sail'd the stately Swan, And lightly down the rapid tide The little boat went on. The full orb'd moon, that beam'd around Pale splendour through the night, Cast through the crimson canopy A dim discolour'd light. And swiftly down the hurrying stream In silence still they sail, And the long streamer fluttering fast, Flapp'd to the heavy gale. And he was mute in sullen thought, And she was mute with fear, Nor sound but of the parting tide Broke on the listening ear. The little babe began to cry; Then Margaret raised her head, And with a quick and hollow voice “Give me the child!” she said. “Now hush thee, hush thee, Margaret, Nor my poor heart distress! I do but pay perforce the price Of former happiness. “And hush thee too, my little babe! Thy cries so feeble cease; Lie still, lie still; . . a little while And thou shalt be at peace.” So as he spake to land they drew, And swift he stept on shore, And him behind did Margaret Close follow evermore. It was a place all desolate, Nor house nor tree was there; But there a rocky mountain rose, Barren, and bleak, and bare. And at its base a cavern yawn'd, No eye its depth might view, For in the moon-beam shining round That darkness darker grew. Cold horror crept through Margaret's blood, Her heart it paused with fear, When Rudiger approach'd the cave, And cried, “Lo, I am here!” A deep sepulchral sound the cave Return'd “Lo, I am here!” And black from out the cavern gloom Two giant arms appear. And Rudiger approach'd, and held The little infant nigh; Then Margaret shriek'd, and gather'd then New powers from agony. And round the baby fast and close Her trembling arms she folds, And with a strong convulsive grasp The little infant holds. “Now help me, Jesus!” loud she cries, And loud on God she calls; Then from the grasp of Rudiger The little infant falls. The mother holds her precious babe; But the black arms clasp'd him round, And dragg'd the wretched Rudiger Adown the dark profound. Bristol, 1796. JASPAR. Jaspar was poor, and vice and want Had made his heart like stone; And Jaspar look'd with envious eyes On riches not his own. On plunder bent abroad he went Toward the close of day, And loiter'd on the lonely road Impatient for his prey. No traveller came.. he loiter'd long, And often look'd around, And paused and listen'd eagerly To catch some coming sound. He sate him down beside the stream That crost the lonely way, So fair a scene might well have charm'd All evil thoughts away: He sate beneath a willow tree Which cast a trembling shade; The gentle river full in front A little island made; Where pleasantly the moon-beam shone Upon the poplar trees, Whose shadow on the stream below Play'd slowly to the breeze. He listen'd.. and he heard the wind That waved the willow tree; He heard the waters flow along, And murmur quietly. He listen'd for the traveller's tread, The nightingale sung sweet; . . He started up, for now he heard The sound of coming feet; He started up and graspt a stake, And waited for his prey; There came a lonely traveller, And Jaspar crost his way. But Jaspar's threats and curses fail'd The traveller to appal, He would not lightly yield the purse Which held his little all. A while he struggled, but he strove With Jaspar's strength in vain; Beneath his blows he fell and groan'd, And never spake again. Jaspar raised up the murder'd man, And plunged him in the flood, And in the running water then He cleansed his hands from blood. The waters closed around the corpse, And cleansed his hands from gore, The willow waved, the stream flow'd on, And murmured as before. There was no human eye had seen The blood the murderer spilt, And Jaspar's conscience never felt The avenging goad of guilt. And soon the ruffian had consumed The gold he gain'd so ill, And years of secret guilt pass'd on, And he was needy still. One eve beside the alehouse fire He sate as it befell, When in there came a labouring man Whom Jaspar knew full well. He sate him down by Jaspar's side, A melancholy man, For spite of honest toil, the world Went hard with Jonathan. His toil a little earn'd, and he With little was content; But sickness on his wife had fallen, And all was well-nigh spent. Long with his wife and little ones He shared the scanty meal, And saw their looks of wretchedness, And felt what wretches feel. Their Landlord, a hard man, that day, Had seized the little left, And now the sufferer found himself Of every thing bereft. He leant his head upon his hand, His elbow on his knee, And so by Jaspar's side he sate, And not a word said he. “Nay, . . why so downcast?” Jaspar cried, “Come.. cheer up, Jonathan! Drink, neighbour, drink! 'twill warm thy heart.. Come! come! take courage, man!” He took the cup that Jaspar gave, And down he drain'd it quick; “I have a wife,” said Jonathan, “And she is deadly sick. “She has no bed to lie upon, I saw them take her bed... And I have children.. would to God That they and I were dead! “Our Landlord he goes home to-night, And he will sleep in peace... I would that I were in my grave, For there all troubles cease. “In vain I pray'd him to forbear, Though wealth enough has he! God be to him as merciless As he has been to me!” When Jaspar saw the poor man's soul On all his ills intent, He plied him with the heartening cup, And with him forth he went. “This Landlord on his homeward road 'Twere easy now to meet. The road is lonesome, Jonathan! . . And vengeance, man! is sweet.” He listen'd to the tempter's voice, The thought it made him start; . . His head was hot, and wretchedness Had harden'd now his heart. Along the lonely road they went And waited for their prey, They sate them down beside the stream That crost the lonely way. They sate them down beside the stream And never a word they said, They sate and listen'd silently To hear the traveller's tread. The night was calm, the night was dark, No star was in the sky, The wind it waved the willow boughs, The stream flow'd quietly. The night was calm, the air was still, Sweet sung the nightingale; The soul of Jonathan was soothed, His heart began to fail. “'Tis weary waiting here,” he cried, “And now the hour is late, . . . Methinks he will not come to-night, No longer let us wait.” “Have patience, man!” the ruffian said, “A little we may wait; But longer shall his wife expect Her husband at the gate.” Then Jonathan grew sick at heart; “My conscience yet is clear! Jaspar.. it is not yet too late.. I will not linger here.” “How now!” cried Jaspar, “why, I thought Thy conscience was asleep; No more such qualms, the night is dark, The river here is deep.” “What matters that,” said Jonathan, Whose blood began to freeze, “When there is One above whose eye The deeds of darkness sees?” “We are safe enough,” said Jaspar then, “If that be all thy fear! Nor eye above, nor eye below, Can pierce the darkness here.” That instant as the murderer spake There came a sudden light; Strong as the mid-day sun it shone, Though all around was night; It hung upon the willow tree, It hung upon the flood, It gave to view the poplar isle, And all the scene of blood The traveller who journeys there, He surely hath espied A madman who has made his home Upon the river's side. His cheek is pale, his eye is wild, His look bespeaks despair; For Jaspar since that hour has made His home unshelter'd there. And fearful are his dreams at night, And dread to him the day; He thinks upon his untold crime, And never dares to pray. The summer suns, the winter storms, O'er him unheeded roll, For heavy is the weight of blood Upon the maniac's soul. Bath, 1798. LORD WILLIAM. No eye beheld when William plunged Young Edmund in the stream, No human ear but William's heard Young Edmund's drowning scream. Submissive all the vassals own'd The murderer for their Lord, And he as rightful heir possess'd The house of Erlingford. The ancient house of Erlingford Stood in a fair domain, And Severn's ample waters near Roll'd through the fertile plain. And often the way-faring man Would love to linger there, Forgetful of his onward road, To gaze on scenes so fair. But never could Lord William dare To gaze on Severn's stream; In every wind that swept its waves He heard young Edmund's scream. In vain at midnight's silent hour Sleep closed the murderer's eyes, In every dream the murderer saw Young Edmund's form arise. In vain by restless conscience driven Lord William left his home, Far from the scenes that saw his guilt, In pilgrimage to roam; To other climes the pilgrim fled, But could not fly despair; He sought his home again, but peace Was still a stranger there. Slow were the passing hours, yet swift The months appeared to roll; And now the day return'd that shook With terror William's soul; A day that William never felt Return without dismay, For well had conscience kalendar'd Young Edmund's dying day. A fearful day was that; the rains Fell fast with tempest roar, And the swoln tide of Severn spread Far on the level shore. In vain Lord William sought the feast, In vain he quaff'd the bowl, And strove with noisy mirth to drown The anguish of his soul. The tempest, as its sudden swell In gusty howlings came, With cold and death-like feeling seem'd To thrill his shuddering frame. Reluctant now, as night came on, His lonely couch he prest; And, wearied out, he sunk to sleep, . . To sleep.. but not to rest. Beside that couch his brother's form, Lord Edmund seem'd to stand, Such and so pale as when in death He grasp'd his brother's hand; Such and so pale his face as when With faint and faltering tongue, To William's care, a dying charge, He left his orphan son. “I bade thee with a father's love My orphan Edmund guard; . . Well, William, hast thou kept thy charge! Take now thy due reward.” He started up, each limb convulsed With agonizing fear; He only heard the storm of night, . . 'Twas music to his ear. When lo! the voice of loud alarm His inmost soul appals; “What ho! Lord William, rise in haste! The water saps thy walls!” He rose in haste, beneath the walls He saw the flood appear; It hemm'd him round, 'twas midnight now, No human aid was near. He heard a shout of joy, for now A boat approach'd the wall, And eager to the welcome aid They crowd for safety all. “My boat is small,” the boatman cried, “'Twill bear but one away; Come in, Lord William, and do ye In God's protection stay.” Strange feeling fill'd them at his voice Even in that hour of woe, That, save their Lord, there was not one Who wish'd with him to go. But William leapt into the boat, His terror was so sore; “Thou shalt have half my gold,” he cried, Haste.. haste to yonder shore.” The boatman plied the oar, the boat Went light along the stream; Sudden Lord William heard a cry Like Edmund's drowning scream. The boatman paused, “Methought I heard A child's distressful cry!” “'Twas but the howling wind of night,” Lord William made reply. “Haste.. haste.. ply swift and strong the oar; Haste.. haste across the stream!” Again Lord William heard a cry Like Edmund's drowning scream. “I heard a child's distressful voice,” The boatman cried again. “Nay, hasten on.. the night is dark.. And we should search in vain.” “O God! Lord William, dost thou know How dreadful 'tis to die? And canst thou without pity hear A child's expiring cry? “How horrible it is to sink Beneath the closing stream, To stretch the powerless arms in vain, In vain for help to scream!” The shriek again was heard: it came More deep, more piercing loud; That instant o'er the flood the moon Shone through a broken cloud; And near them they beheld a child; Upon a crag he stood, A little crag, and all around Was spread the rising flood. The boatman plied the oar, the boat Approach'd his resting-place; The moon-beam shone upon the child, And show'd how pale his face. “Now reach thine hand!” the boatman cried, “Lord William, reach and save!” The child stretch'd forth his little hands To grasp the hand he gave. Then William shriek'd; the hands he felt Were cold and damp and dead! He held young Edmund in his arms A heavier weight than lead. The boat sunk down, the murderer sunk Beneath the avenging stream; He rose, he shriek'd, no human ear Heard William's drowning scream. Westbury, 1798. ST. PATRICK'S PURGATORY. 1 “Enter, Sir Knight,” the Warden cried, “And trust in Heaven whate'er betide, Since you have reach'd this bourn; But first receive refreshment due, 'Twill then be time to welcome you If ever you return.” 2 Three sops were brought of bread and wine; Well might Sir Owen then divine The mystic warning given, That he against our ghostly Foe Must soon to mortal combat go, And put his trust in Heaven. 3 Sir Owen pass'd the convent gate, The Warden him conducted straight To where a coffin lay; The Monks around in silence stand, Each with a funeral torch in hand Whose light bedimm'd the day. 4 “Few Pilgrims ever reach this bourn,’ They said, “but fewer still return; Yet, let what will ensue, Our duties are prescribed and clear; Put off all mortal weakness here, This coffin is for you. 5 “Lie there, while we with pious breath Raise over you the dirge of death, This comfort we can give; Belike no living hands may pay This office to your lifeless clay, Receive it while you live!” 6 Sir Owen in a shroud was drest, They placed a cross upon his breast, And down he laid his head; Around him stood the funeral train, And sung with slow and solemn strain The Service of the Dead. 7 Then to the entrance of the Cave They led the Christian warrior brave; Some fear he well might feel, For none of all the Monks could tell The terrors of that mystic cell, Its secrets none reveal. 8 “Now enter here,” the Warden cried, “And God, Sir Owen, be your guide! Your name shall live in story: For of the few who reach this shore, Still fewer venture to explore St. Patrick's Purgatory.” 9 Adown the Cavern's long descent, Feeling his way Sir Owen went, With cautious feet and slow; Unarm'd, for neither sword nor spear, Nor shield of proof avail'd him here Against our ghostly Foe. 10 The ground was moist beneath his tread, Large drops fell heavy on his head, The air was damp and chill, And sudden shudderings o'er him came, And he could feel through all his frame An icy sharpness thrill. 11 Now steeper grew the dark descent; In fervent prayer the Pilgrim went, 'Twas silence all around, Save his own echo from the cell, And the large drops that frequent fell With dull and heavy sound. 12 But colder now he felt the cell, Those heavy drops no longer fell, Thin grew the piercing air; And now upon his aching sight, There dawn'd far off a feeble light, In hope he hasten'd there. 13 Emerging now once more to day A frozen waste before him lay, A desert wild and wide, Where ice-rocks in a sunless sky, On ice-rocks piled, and mountains high, Were heap'd on every side. 14 Impending as about to fall They seem'd, and had that sight been all, Enough that sight had been To make the stoutest courage quail; For what could courage there avail Against what then was seen? 15 He saw, as on in faith he past, Where many a frozen wretch was fast Within the ice-clefts pent, Yet living still, and doom'd to bear In absolute and dumb despair Their endless punishment. 16 A Voice then spake within his ear, And fill'd his inmost soul with fear, “O mortal Man,” it said, “Adventurers like thyself were these!” He seem'd to feel his life-blood freeze, And yet subdued his dread. 17 “O mortal Man,” the Voice pursued, “Be wise in time! for thine own good Alone I counsel thee; Take pity on thyself, retrace Thy steps, and fly this dolorous place While yet thy feet are free. 18 “I warn thee once! I warn thee twice! Behold! that mass of mountain-ice Is trembling o'er thy head! One warning is allow'd thee more; O mortal Man, that warning o'er, And thou art worse than dead!” 19 Not without fear, Sir Owen still Held on with strength of righteous will, In faith and fervent prayer; When at the word, “I warn thee thrice!” Down came the mass of mountain ice, And overwhelm'd him there. 20 Crush'd though, it seem'd, in every bone, And sense for suffering left alone, A living hope remain'd; In whom he had believed, he knew, And thence the holy courage grew That still his soul sustain'd 21 For he, as he beheld it fall, Fail'd not in faith on Christ to call, “Lord, Thou canst save!” he cried; O heavenly help vouchsafed in need, When perfect faith is found indeed; The rocks of ice divide. 22 Like dust before the storm-wind's sway The shiver'd fragments roll'd away, And left the passage free; New strength he feels, all pain is gone, New life Sir Owen breathes, and on He goes rejoicingly. 23 Yet other trials he must meet, For soon a close and piercing heat Relax'd each loosen'd limb; The sweat stream'd out from every part, In short quick beatings toil'd his heart, His throbbing eyes grew dim. 24 Along the wide and wasted land A stream of fire through banks of sand Its molten billows spread; Thin vapours tremulously light Hung quivering o'er the glowing white, The air he breathed was red. 25 A Paradise beyond was seen, Of shady groves and gardens green, Fair flowers and fruitful trees, And flowing fountains cool and clear, Whose gurgling music reach'd his ear Borne on the burning breeze. 26 How should he pass that molten flood? While gazing wistfully he stood, A Fiend, as in a dream, “Thus!” answer'd the unutter'd thought, Stretch'd forth a mighty arm, and caught And cast him in the stream. 27 Sir Owen groan'd, for then he felt His eyeballs burn, his marrow melt, His brain like liquid lead, And from his heart the boiling blood Its agonizing course pursued Through limbs like iron red. 28 Yet, giving way to no despair, But mindful of the aid of prayer, “Lord, Thou canst save!” he said; And then a breath from Eden came, With life and healing through his frame The blissful influence spread. 29 No Fiends may now his way oppose, The gates of Paradise unclose, Free entrance there is given; And songs of triumph meet his ear, Enrapt, Sir Owen seems to hear The harmonies of Heaven. 30 “Come, Pilgrim! take thy foretaste meet, Thou who hast trod with fearless feet St. Patrick's Purgatory, For after death these seats divine, Reward eternal, shall be thine And thine eternal glory.” 31 Inebriate with the deep delight, Dim grew the Pilgrim's swimming sight, His senses died away; And when to life he woke, before The Cavern-mouth he saw once more The light of earthly day. Westbury, 1798. THE CROSS ROADS. 1 There was an old man breaking stones To mend the turnpike way; He sate him down beside a brook, And out his bread and cheese he took, For now it was mid-day. 2 He leant his back against a post, His feet the brook ran by; And there were water-cresses growing, And pleasant was the water's flowing, For he was hot and dry. 3 A soldier with his knapsack on Came travelling o'er the down; The sun was strong and he was tired; And he of the old man enquired “How far to Bristol town?” 4 “Half an hour's walk for a young man, By lanes and fields and stiles; But you the foot-path do not know. And if along the road you go Why then 'tis three good miles.” 5 The soldier took his knapsack off, For he was hot and dry; And out his bread and cheese he took, And he sat down beside the brook To dine in company. 6 “Old friend! in faith,” the soldier says, “I envy you almost; My shoulders have been sorely prest, And I should like to sit, and rest My back against that post. 7 “In such a sweltering day as this A knapsack is the devil; And if on t' other side I sat, It would not only spoil our chat, But make me seem uncivil.” 8 The old man laugh'd and moved... “I wish It were a great-arm'd chair! But this may help a man at need; . . And yet it was a cursed deed That ever brought it there. 9 “There's a poor girl lies buried here, Beneath this very place, The earth upon her corpse is prest, This post was driven into her breast, And a stone is on her face.” 10 The soldier had but just leant back, And now he half rose up. “There's sure no harm in dining here, My friend? and yet, to be sincere, I should not like to sup.” 11 “God rest her! she is still enough Who sleeps beneath my feet!” The old man cried. “No harm I trow, She ever did herself, though now She lies where four roads meet. 12 “I have past by about that hour When men are not most brave; It did not make my courage fail, And I have heard the nightingale Sing sweetly on her grave. 13 “I have past by about that hour When ghosts their freedom have; But here I saw no ghastly sight, And quietly the glow-worm's light Was shining on her grave. 14 “There's one who like a Christian lies Beneath the church-tree's shade; I'd rather go a long mile round Than pass at evening through the ground Wherein that man is laid. 15 “A decent burial that man had, The bell was heard to toll, When he was laid in holy ground, But for all the wealth in Bristol town I would not be with his soul! 16 “Did'st see a house below the hill Which the winds and the rains destroy? In that farm-house did that man dwell, And I remember it full well When I was a growing boy. 17 “But she was a poor parish girl Who came up from the west: From service hard she ran away, And at that house in evil day Was taken in to rest. 18 “A man of a bad name was he, An evil life he led; Passion made his dark face turn white, And his grey eyes were large and light, And in anger they grew red. 19 “The man was bad, the mother worse, Bad fruit of evil stem; 'Twould make your hair to stand on end If I should tell to you, my friend, The things that were told of them! 20 “Did'st see an out-house standing by? The walls alone remain; It was a stable then, but now Its mossy roof has fallen through All rotted by the rain. 21 “This poor girl she had served with them Some half-a-year or more, When she was found hung up one day, Stiff as a corpse and cold as clay, Behind that stable door. 22 “It is a wild and lonesome place, No hut or house is near; Should one meet a murderer there alone, 'Twere vain to scream, and the dying groan Would never reach mortal ear. 23 “And there were strange reports about; But still the coroner found That she by her own hand had died, And should buried be by the way-side, And not in Christian ground. 24 “This was the very place he chose, Just where these four roads meet; And I was one among the throng That hither follow'd them along, I shall never the sight forget! 25 “They carried her upon a board In the clothes in which she died; I saw the cap blown off her head, Her face was of a dark dark red, Her eyes were starting wide: 26 “I think they could not have been closed, So widely did they strain. O Lord, it was a ghastly sight, And it often made me wake at night, When I saw it in dreams again. 27 “They laid her where these four roads meet, Here in this very place. The earth upon her corpse was prest, This post was driven into her breast, And a stone is on her face.” Westbury, 1798. GOD'S JUDGEMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP. The summer and autumn had been so wet, That in winter the corn was growing yet, 'Twas a piteous sight to see all around The grain lie rotting on the ground. Every day the starving poor Crowded around Bishop Hatto's door, For he had a plentiful last-year's store, And all the neighbourhood could tell His granaries were furnish'd well. At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day To quiet the poor without delay; He bade them to his great Barn repair, And they should have food for the winter there Rejoiced such tidings good to hear, The poor folk flock'd from far and near; The great Barn was full as it could hold Of women and children, and young and old. Then when he saw it could hold no more, Bishop Hatto he made fast the door; And while for mercy on Christ they call, He set fire to the Barn and burnt them all. “I'faith 'tis an excellent bonfire!” quoth he, “And the country is greatly obliged to me, For ridding it in these times forlorn Of Rats that only consume the corn.” So then to his palace returned he, And he sat down to supper merrily, And he slept that night like an innocent man; But Bishop Hatto never slept again. In the morning as he enter'd the hall Where his picture hung against the wall, A sweat like death all over him came, For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame. As he look'd there came a man from his farm, He had a countenance white with alarm; “My Lord, I open'd your granaries this morn, And the Rats had eaten all your corn.” Another came running presently, And he was pale as pale could be, “Fly! my Lord Bishop, fly,” quoth he, “Ten thousand Rats are coming this way, . . . The Lord forgive you for yesterday!” “I'll go to my tower on the Rhine,” replied he, “'Tis the safest place in Germany; The walls are high and the shores are steep, And the stream is strong and the water deep.” Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away, And he crost the Rhine without delay, And reach'd his tower, and barr'd with care All the windows, doors, and loop-holes there. He laid him down and closed his eyes; . . But soon a scream made him arise, He started and saw two eyes of flame On his pillow from whence the screaming came. He listen'd and look'd; . . . it was only the Cat; But the Bishop he grew more fearful for that, For she sat screaming, mad with fear At the Army of Rats that were drawing near. For they have swam over the river so deep, And they have climb'd the shores so steep, And up the Tower their way is bent, To do the work for which they were sent. They are not to be told by the dozen or score, By thousands they come, and by myriads and more, Such numbers had never been heard of before, Such a judgement had never been witness'd of yore. Down on his knees the Bishop fell, And faster and faster his beads did he tell, As louder and louder drawing near The gnawing of their teeth he could hear. And in at the windows and in at the door, And through the walls helter-skelter they pour, And down from the ceiling and up through the floor, From the right and the left, from behind and before, From within and without, from above and below, And all at once to the Bishop they go. They have whetted their teeth against the stones, And now they pick the Bishop's bones; They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb, For they were sent to do judgement on him! Westbury, 1799. THE PIOUS PAINTER. THE FIRST PART. 1 There once was a painter in Catholic days, Like Job who eschewed all evil; Still on his Madonnas the curious may gaze With applause and with pleasure, but chiefly his praise And delight was in painting the Devil. 2 They were Angels, compared to the Devils he drew, Who besieged poor St. Anthony's cell; Such burning hot eyes, such a furnace-like hue! And round them a sulphurous colouring he threw That their breath seem'd of brimstone to smell. 3 And now had the artist a picture begun, 'Twas over the Virgin's church-door; She stood on the Dragon embracing her Son; Many Devils already the artist had done, But this must out-do all before. 4 The Old Dragon's imps as they fled through the air, At seeing it paused on the wing; For he had the likeness so just to a hair, That they came as Apollyon himself had been there, To pay their respects to their King. 5 Every child at beholding it trembled with dread, And scream'd as he turn'd away quick. Not an old woman saw it, but, raising her head, Dropt a bead, made a cross on her wrinkles, and said, Lord keep me from ugly Old Nick! 6 What the Painter so earnestly thought on by day, He sometimes would dream of by night; But once he was startled as sleeping he lay; 'Twas no fancy, no dream, he could plainly survey That the Devil himself was in sight. 7 “You rascally dauber!” old Beelzebub cries, “Take heed how you wrong me again! Though your caricatures for myself I despise, Make me handsomer now in the multitude's eyes, Or see if I threaten in vain!” 8 Now the Painter was bold, and religious beside, And on faith he had certain reliance; So carefully he the grim countenance eyed, And thank'd him for sitting with Catholic pride, And sturdily bade him defiance. 9 Betimes in the morning the Painter arose, He is ready as soon as 'tis light. Every look, every line, every feature he knows, 'Tis fresh in his eye, to his labour he goes, And he has the old Wicked One quite. 10 Happy man! he is sure the resemblance can't fail; The tip of the nose is like fire, There's his grin and his fangs, and his dragon-like mail, And the very identical curl of his tail, . . So that nothing is left to desire. 11 He looks and retouches again with delight; 'Tis a portrait complete to his mind; And exulting again and again at the sight, He looks round for applause, and he sees with affright The Original standing behind. 12 “Fool! Idiot!” old Beelzebub grinn'd as he spoke, And stampt on the scaffold in ire; The Painter grew pale, for he knew it no joke; 'Twas a terrible height, and the scaffolding broke, The Devil could wish it no higher. 13 “Help.. help! Blessed Mary!” he cried in alarm, As the scaffold sunk under his feet. From the canvass the Virgin extended her arm, She caught the good Painter, she saved him from harm; There were hundreds who saw in the street. 14 The Old Dragon fled when the wonder he spied, And cursed his own fruitless endeavour; While the Painter call'd after his rage to deride, Shook his pallet and brushes in triumph and cried, “I'll paint thee more ugly than ever!” THE SECOND PART. 1 The Painter so pious all praise had acquired For defying the malice of Hell; The Monks the unerring resemblance admired; Not a Lady lived near but her portrait desired From a hand that succeeded so well. 2 One there was to be painted the number among Of features most fair to behold; The country around of fair Marguerite rung, Marguerite she was lovely and lively and young, Her husband was ugly and old. 3 O Painter, avoid her! O Painter, take care, For Satan is watchful for you! Take heed lest you fall in the Wicked One's snare, The net is made ready, O Painter, beware Of Satan and Marguerite too. 4 She seats herself now, now she lifts up her head, On the artist she fixes her eyes; The colours are ready, the canvass is spread, He lays on the white, and he lays on the red, And the features of beauty arise. 5 He is come to her eyes, eyes so bright and so blue! There's a look which he cannot express; . . His colours are dull to their quick-sparkling hue; More and more on the lady he fixes his view, On the canvass he looks less and less. 6 In vain he retouches, her eyes sparkle more, And that look which fair Marguerite gave! Many Devils the Artist had painted of yore, But he never had tried a live Angel before, . . St. Anthony, help him and save! 7 He yielded, alas! for the truth must be told, To the Woman, the Tempter, and Fate. It was settled the Lady so fair to behold, Should elope from her Husband so ugly and old, With the Painter so pious of late. 8 Now Satan exults in his vengeance complete, To the Husband he makes the scheme known; Night comes and the lovers impatiently meet; Together they fly, they are seized in the street, And in prison the Painter is thrown. 9 With Repentance, his only companion, he lies, And a dismal companion is she! On a sudden he saw the Old Enemy rise, “Now, you villanous dauber!” Sir Beelzebub cries, “You are paid for your insults to me! 10 “But my tender heart you may easily move If to what I propose you agree; That picture, . . be just! the resemblance improve; Make a handsomer portrait, your chains I'll remove, And you shall this instant be free.” 11 Overjoy'd, the conditions so easy he hears, “I'll make you quite handsome!” he said. He said, and his chain on the Devil appears; Released from his prison, released from his fears, The Painter is snug in his bed. 12 At morn he arises, composes his look, And proceeds to his work as before; The people beheld him, the culprit they took; They thought that the Painter his prison had broke, And to prison they led him once more. 13 They open the dungeon; . . behold in his place In the corner old Beelzebub lay; He smirks and he smiles and he leers with a grace, That the Painter might catch all the charms of his face, Then vanish'd in lightning away. 14 Quoth the Painter, “I trust you'll suspect me no more, Since you find my assertions were true. But I'll alter the picture above the Church-door, For he never vouchsafed me a sitting before, And I must give the Devil his due.” Westbury, 1798. ST. MICHAEL'S CHAIR. Merrily, merrily rung the bells, The bells of St. Michael's tower, When Richard Penlake and Rebecca his wife Arrived at St. Michael's door. Richard Penlake was a cheerful man, Cheerful and frank and free, But he led a sad life with Rebecca his wife, For a terrible shrew was she. Richard Penlake a scolding would take, Till patience avail'd no longer, Then Richard Penlake his crab-stick would take, And show her that he was the stronger. Rebecca his wife had often wish'd To sit in St. Michael's chair; For she should be the mistress then If she had once sat there. It chanced that Richard Penlake fell sick, They thought he would have died; Rebecca his wife made a vow for his life, As she knelt by his bed-side. “Now hear my prayer, St. Michael! and spare My husband's life,” quoth she; “And to thine altar we will go, Six marks to give to thee.” Richard Penlake repeated the vow, For woundily sick was he; “Save me, St. Michael, and we will go Six marks to give to thee.” When Richard grew well, Rebecca his wife Teazed him by night and by day: “O mine own dear! for you I fear, If we the vow delay.” Merrily, merrily rung the bells, The bells of St. Michael's tower, When Richard Penlake, and Rebecca his wife Arrived at St. Michael's door. Six marks they on the altar laid, And Richard knelt in prayer: She left him to pray, and stole away To sit in St. Michael's chair. Up the tower Rebecca ran, Round and round and round; 'Twas a giddy sight to stand a-top, And look upon the ground. “A curse on the ringers for rocking The tower!” Rebecca cried, As over the church battlements She strode with a long stride. “A blessing on St. Michael's chair!” She said as she sat down: Merrily, merrily rung the bells, And out Rebecca was thrown. Tidings to Richard Penlake were brought That his good wife was dead: “Now shall we toll for her poor soul The great church bell?” they said. “Toll at her burying,” quoth Richard Penlake, “Toll at her burying,” quoth he; “But don't disturb the ringers now In compliment to me.” Westbury, 1798. KING HENRY V. AND THE HERMIT OF DREUX. He pass'd unquestion'd through the camp, Their heads the soldiers bent In silent reverence, or begg'd A blessing as he went; And so the Hermit pass'd along And reached the royal tent. King Henry sate in his tent alone, The map before him lay, Fresh conquests he was planning there To grace the future day. King Henry lifted up his eyes The intruder to behold; With reverence he the hermit saw, For the holy man was old, His look was gentle as a Saint's, And yet his eye was bold. “Repent thee, Henry, of the wrongs Which thou hast done this land! O King, repent in time, for know The judgement is at hand. “I have pass'd forty years of peace Beside the river Blaise, But what a weight of woe hast thou Laid on my latter days! “I used to see along the stream The white sail gliding down, That wafted food in better times To yonder peaceful town. “Henry! I never now behold The white sail gliding down; Famine, Disease, and Death, and Thou Destroy that wretched town. “I used to hear the traveller's voice As here he pass'd along, Or maiden as she loiter'd home Singing her even-song. “No traveller's voice may now be heard, In fear he hastens by; But I have heard the village maid In vain for succour cry. “I used to see the youths row down And watch the dripping oar, As pleasantly their viol's tones Came soften'd to the shore. “King Henry, many a blacken'd corpse I now see floating down! Thou man of blood! repent in time, And leave this leaguer'd town.” “I shall go on,” King Henry cried, “And conquer this good land; Seest thou not, Hermit, that the Lord Hath given it to my hand?” The Hermit heard King Henry speak, And angrily look'd down; . . His face was gentle, and for that More solemn was his frown. “What if no miracle from Heaven The murderer's arm controul, Think you for that the weight of blood Lies lighter on his soul? “Thou conqueror King, repent in time Or dread the coming woe! For, Henry, thou hast heard the threat, And soon shalt feel the blow!” King Henry forced a careless smile, As the hermit went his way; But Henry soon remember'd him Upon his dying day. Westbury, 1798. OLD CHRISTOVAL'S ADVICE, AND THE REASON WHY HE GAVE IT. “If thy debtor be poor,” old Christoval said, “Exact not too hardly thy due; For he who preserves a poor man from want May preserve him from wickedness too. “If thy neighbour should sin,” old Christoval said, “Oh never unmerciful be; But remember it is through the mercy of God That thou art not as sinful as he. “At sixty-and-seven the hope of Heaven Is my comfort through God's good grace; My summons, in truth, had I perish'd in youth, Must have been to a different place.” “You shall have the farm, young Christoval,” My master Henrique said; “But a surety provide, in whom I can confide, That duly the rent shall be paid.” I was poor, and I had not a friend upon earth, And I knew not what to say; We stood in the porch of St. Andrew's Church And it was St. Isidro's day. “Take St. Isidro for my pledge,” I ventured to make reply, “The Saint in Heaven may be my friend, But friendless on earth am I.” We enter'd the Church, and went to his shrine, And I fell on my bended knee, “I am friendless, holy Isidro, And therefore I call upon thee! “I call upon thee my surety to be, My purpose is honest and true; And if ever I break my plighted word, O Saint, mayst thou make me rue!” I was idle, and quarter-day came on, And I had not the rent in store, I fear'd St. Isidro's anger, But I dreaded my landlord more. So on a dark night I took my flight And stole like a thief away; It happen'd that by St. Andrew's Church The road I had chosen lay. As I past the Church door, I thought how I swore Upon St. Isidro's day; That the Saint was so near increased my fear, And faster I hasten'd away. So all night long I hurried on, Pacing full many a mile, And knew not his avenging hand Was on me all the while. Weary I was, yet safe, I thought; But when it was day-light I had I found been running round And round the Church all night. I shook like a palsy, and fell on my knees, And for pardon devoutly I pray'd; When my master came up, “What, Christoval, You are here betimes!” he said. “I have been idle, good Master,” said I, “Good Master, and I have done wrong; And I have been running round the Church In penance all night long.” “If thou hast been idle,” Henrique replied, “Henceforth thy fault amend! I will not oppress thee, Christoval, And the Saint may thy labour befriend.” Homeward I went a penitent, And from that day I idled no more; St. Isidro bless'd my industry, As he punish'd my sloth before. “When my debtor was poor,” old Christoval said, “I have never exacted my due; But remembering my master was good to me, I copied his goodness too. “When my neighbour hath sinn'd,” old Christoval said, “I judged not too hardly his sin, But thought of the night by St. Andrew's Church, And consider'd what I might have been.” Westbury, 1798. CORNELIUS AGRIPPA; A BALLAD, OF A YOUNG MAN THAT WOULD READ UNLAWFUL BOOKS, AND HOW HE WAS PUNISHED. VERY PITHY AND PROFITABLE. Cornelius Agrippa went out one day, His Study he lock'd ere he went away, And he gave the key of the door to his wife, And charged her to keep it lock'd on her life. “And if any one ask my Study to see, I charge you to trust them not with the key; Whoever may beg, and entreat, and implore, On your life let nobody enter that door.” There lived a young man in the house, who in vain Access to that Study had sought to obtain; And he begg'd and pray'd the books to see, Till the foolish woman gave him the key. On the Study-table a book there lay, Which Agrippa himself had been reading that day; The letters were written with blood therein, And the leaves were made of dead men's skin; And these horrible leaves of magic between Were the ugliest pictures that ever were seen, The likeness of things so foul to behold, That what they were is not fit to be told. The young man, he began to read He knew not what, but he would proceed, When there was heard a sound at the door Which as he read on grew more and more. And more and more the knocking grew, The young man knew not what to do; But trembling in fear he sat within, Till the door was broke, and the Devil came in. Two hideous horns on his head he had got, Like iron heated nine times red-hot; The breath of his nostrils was brimstone blue, And his tail like a fiery serpent grew. “What wouldst thou with me?” the Wicked One cried, But not a word the young man replied; Every hair on his head was standing upright, And his limbs like a palsy shook with affright. “What wouldst thou with me?” cried the Author of ill, But the wretched young man was silent still; Not a word had his lips the power to say, And his marrow seem'd to be melting away. “What wouldst thou with me?” the third time he cries, And a flash of lightning came from his eyes, And he lifted his griffin claw in the air, And the young man had not strength for a prayer His eyes red fire and fury dart As out he tore the young man's heart; He grinn'd a horrible grin at his prey, And in a clap of thunder vanish'd away. THE MORAL. Henceforth let all young men take heed How in a Conjuror's books they read. Westbury, 1798. KING CHARLEMAIN. 1 It was strange that he loved her, for youth was gone by, And the bloom of her beauty was fled: 'Twas the glance of the harlot that gleam'd in her eye, And all but the Monarch could plainly descry From whence came her white and her red. 2 Yet he thought with Agatha none might compare, And he gloried in wearing her chain; The court was a desert if she were not there, To him she alone among women seem'd fair, Such dotage possess'd Charlemain. 3 The soldier, the statesman, the courtier, the maid, Alike the proud leman detest; And the good old Archbishop, who ceased to upbraid, Shook his grey head in sorrow, and silently pray'd That he soon might consign her to rest. 4 A joy ill-dissembled soon gladdens them all, For Agatha sickens and dies. And now they are ready with bier and with pall, The tapers gleam gloomy amid the high hall, And the strains of the requiem arise. 5 But Charlemain sent them in anger away, For she should not be buried, he said; And despite of all counsel, for many a day, Where array'd in her costly apparel she lay, The Monarch would sit by the dead. 6 The cares of the kingdom demand him in vain, And the army cry out for their Lord; The Lombards, the fierce misbelievers of Spain, Now ravage the realms of the proud Charlemain, And still he unsheathes not the sword. 7 The Soldiers they clamour, the Monks bend in prayer In the quiet retreats of the cell; The Physicians to counsel together repair, And with common consent, one and all they declare That his senses are bound by a spell. 8 Then with relics protected, and confident grown, And telling devoutly his beads, The good old Archbishop, when this was made known, Steals in when he hears that the corpse is alone, And to look for the spell he proceeds. 9 He searches with care, though with tremulous haste, For the spell that bewitches the King; And under her tongue for security placed, Its margin with mystical characters traced, At length he discovers a ring. 10 Rejoicing he seized it and hasten'd away, The Monarch re-enter'd the room; The enchantment was ended, and suddenly gay He bade the attendants no longer delay, But bear her with speed to the tomb. 11 Now merriment, joyaunce, and feasting again Enliven'd the palace of Aix; And now by his heralds did King Charlemain Invite to his palace the courtier train To hold a high festival day. 12 And anxiously now for the festival day The highly-born Maidens prepare; And now, all apparell'd in costly array, Exulting they come to the palace of Aix, Young and aged, the brave and the fair. 13 Oh! happy the Damsel who 'mid her compeers For a moment engaged the King's eye! Now glowing with hopes and now fever'd with fears, Each maid or triumphant, or jealous, appears, As noticed by him, or pass'd by. 14 And now as the evening approach'd, to the ball In anxious suspense they advance, Hoping each on herself that the King's choice might fall, When lo! to the utter confusion of all, He ask'd the Archbishop to dance. 15 The damsels they laugh, and the barons they stare, 'Twas mirth and astonishment all; And the Archbishop started, and mutter'd a prayer, And, wroth at receiving such mockery there, In haste he withdrew from the hall. 16 The moon dimpled over the water with light As he wander'd along the lake side; But the King had pursued, and o'erjoyed at his sight, “Oh turn thee, Archbishop, my joy and delight, Oh turn thee, my charmer,” he cried; 17 “Oh come where the feast and the dance and the song Invite thee to mirth and to love; Or at this happy moment away from the throng To the shade of yon wood let us hasten along, . . The moon never pierces that grove.” 18 As thus by new madness the King seem'd possest, In new wonder the Archbishop heard; Then Charlemain warmly and eagerly prest The good old man's poor wither'd hand to his breast And kiss'd his long grey grizzle beard. 19 “Let us well then these fortunate moments employ!” Cried the Monarch with passionate tone: “Come away then, dear charmer, . . my angel, . . my joy, Nay struggle not now, . . 'tis in vain to be coy, . . And remember that we are alone.” 20 “Blessed Mary, protect me!” the Archbishop cried; “What madness has come to the King!” In vain to escape from the Monarch he tried, When luckily he on his finger espied The glitter of Agatha's ring. 21 Overjoy'd, the good prelate remember'd the spell, And far in the lake flung the ring; The waters closed round it, and wondrous to tell, Released from the cursed enchantment of hell, His reason return'd to the King. 22 But he built him a palace there close by the bay, And there did he love to remain; And the traveller who will, may behold at this day A monument still in the ruins at Aix Of the spell that possess'd Charlemain. Bath, 1797. ST. ROMUALD. One day, it matters not to know How many hundred years ago, A Frenchman stopt at an inn door: The Landlord came to welcome him, and chat Of this and that, For he had seen the Traveller there before. “Doth holy Romuald dwell Still in his cell?” The Traveller ask'd, “or is the old man dead?” “No; he has left his loving flock, and we So great a Christian never more shall see,” The Landlord answer'd, and he shook his head. “Ah, Sir! we knew his worth! If ever there did live a Saint on earth! . . Why, Sir, he always used to wear a shirt For thirty days, all seasons, day and night: Good man, he knew it was not right For Dust and Ashes to fall out with Dirt; And then he only hung it out in the rain, And put it on again. There has been perilous work With him and the Devil there in yonder cell; For Satan used to maul him like a Turk. There they would sometimes fight All through a winter's night, From sun-set until morn, He with a cross, the Devil with his horn; The Devil spitting fire with might and main Enough to make St. Michael half afraid; He splashing holy water till he made His red hide hiss again, And the hot vapour fill'd the smoking cell. This was so common that his face became All black and yellow with the brimstone flame, And then he smelt, . . O Lord! how he did smell! “Then, Sir! to see how he would mortify The flesh! If any one had dainty fare, Good man, he would come there, And look at all the delicate things, and cry, “O Belly, Belly, You would be gormandizing now I know; But it shall not be so! . . Home to your bread and water . . home, I tell ye!” “But,” quoth the Traveller, “wherefore did he leave A flock that knew his saintly worth so well?” “Why,” said the Landlord, “Sir, it so befell He heard unluckily of our intent To do him a great honour: and you know, He was not covetous of fame below, And so by stealth one night away he went.” “What might this honour be?” the Traveller cried; “Why, Sir,” the Host replied, “We thought perhaps that he might one day leave us; And then should strangers have The good man's grave, A loss like that would naturally grieve us, For he 'll be made a Saint of to be sure. Therefore we thought it prudent to secure His relics while we might; And so we meant to strangle him one night.” Westbury, 1798. THE KING OF THE CROCODILES. PART I. “Now, Woman, why without your veil? And wherefore do you look so pale? And, Woman, why do you groan so sadly, And wherefore beat your bosom madly?” “Oh! I have lost my darling boy, In whom my soul had all its joy; And I for sorrow have torn my veil, And sorrow hath made my very heart pale. “Oh, I have lost my darling child, And that's the loss that makes me wild; He stoop'd to the river down to drink, And there was a Crocodile by the brink. “He did not venture in to swim, He only stoopt to drink at the brim; But under the reeds the Crocodile lay, And struck with his tail and swept him away. “Now take me in your boat, I pray, For down the river lies my way, And me to the Reed-Island bring, For I will go to the Crocodile King. “He reigns not now in Crocodilople, Proud as the Turk at Constantinople; No ruins of his great City remain, The Island of Reeds is his whole domain. “Like a Dervise there he passes his days, Turns up his eyes, and fasts and prays; And being grown pious and meek and mild, He now never eats man, woman, or child. “The King of the Crocodiles never does wrong. He has no tail so stiff and strong, He has no tail to strike and slay, But he has ears to hear what I say. “And to the King I will complain, How my poor child was wickedly slain; The King of the Crocodiles he is good, And I shall have the murderer's blood.” The man replied, “No, Woman, no, To the Island of Reeds I will not go; I would not for any worldly thing See the face of the Crocodile King.” “Then lend me now your little boat, And I will down the river float. I tell thee that no worldly thing Shall keep me from the Crocodile King. “The King of the Crocodiles he is good, And therefore will give me blood for blood; Being so mighty and so just, He can revenge me, he will, and he must.” The Woman she leapt into the boat, And down the river alone did she float, And fast with the stream the boat proceeds, And now she is come to the Island of Reeds. The King of the Crocodiles there was seen, He sat upon the eggs of the Queen, And all around, a numerous rout, The young Prince Crocodiles crawl'd about. The Woman shook every limb with fear, As she to the Crocodile King came near, For never man without fear and awe The face of his Crocodile Majesty saw. She fell upon her bended knee, And said, “O King, have pity on me, For I have lost my darling child, And that's the loss that makes me wild. “A Crocodile ate him for his food; Now let me have the murderer's blood; Let me have vengeance for my boy, The only thing that can give me joy. “I know that you, Sire! never do wrong, You have no tail so stiff and strong, You have no tail to strike and slay, But you have ears to hear what I say.” “You have done well,” the King replies, And fix'd on her his little eyes; “Good Woman, yes, you have done right, But you have not described me quite. “I have no tail to strike and slay, And I have ears to hear what you say; I have teeth, moreover, as you may see, And I will make a meal of thee.” Bristol, 1799. PART II. Wicked the word and bootless the boast, As cruel King Crocodile found to his cost, And proper reward of tyrannical might, He show'd his teeth, but he miss'd his bite. “A meal of me!” the Woman cried, Taking wit in her anger, and courage beside; She took him his forelegs and hind between, And trundled him off the eggs of the Queen. To revenge herself then she did not fail, He was slow in his motions for want of a tail; But well for the Woman was it, the while, That the Queen was gadding abroad in the Nile. Two Crocodile Princes, as they play'd on the sand, She caught, and grasping them one in each hand, Thrust the head of one into the throat of the other, And made each Prince Crocodile choke his brother. And when she had truss'd three couple this way, She carried them off, and hasten'd away, And plying her oars with might and main, Cross'd the river and got to the shore again. When the Crocodile Queen came home, she found That her eggs were broken and scattered around, And that six young Princes, darlings all, Were missing, for none of them answer'd her call. Then many a not very pleasant thing Pass'd between her and the Crocodile King: “Is this your care of the nest,” cried she; “It comes of your gadding abroad,” said he. The Queen had the better in this dispute, And the Crocodile King found it best to be mute, While a terrible peal in his ears she rung, For the Queen had a tail as well as a tongue. In woeful patience he let her rail, Standing less in fear of her tongue than her tail, And knowing that all the words which were spoken Could not mend one of the eggs that were broken. The Woman, meantime, was very well pleased She had saved her life, and her heart was eased: The justice she ask'd in vain for her son, She had taken herself, and six for one. “Mash-Allah!” her neighbours exclaim'd in delight: She gave them a funeral supper that night, Where they all agreed that revenge was sweet, And young Prince Crocodiles delicate meat. THE ROSE. Nay, Edith! spare the Rose; . . perhaps it lives, And feels the noontide sun, and drinks refresh'd The dews of night; let not thy gentle hand Tear its life-strings asunder, and destroy The sense of being! . . . Why that infidel smile? Come, I will bribe thee to be merciful; And thou shalt have a tale of other days, For I am skill'd in legendary lore, So thou wilt let it live. There was a time Ere this, the freshest, sweetest flower that blooms, Bedeck'd the bowers of earth. Thou hast not heard How first by miracle its fragrant leaves Spread to the sun their blushing lovelines. There dwelt in Bethlehem a Jewish maid, And Zillah was her name, so passing fair That all Judea spake the virgin's praise. He who had seen her eyes' dark radiance How it reveal'd her soul, and what a soul Beam'd in the mild effulgence, woe to him! For not in solitude, for not in crowds, Might he escape remembrance, nor avoid Her imaged form which followed every where, And fill'd the heart, and fix'd the absent eye. Alas for him! her bosom own'd no love Save the strong ardour of religious zeal, For Zillah on her God had center'd all Her spirit's deep affections. So for her Her tribes-men sigh'd in vain, yet reverenced The obdurate virtue that destroy'd their hopes. One man there was, a vain and wretched man, Who saw, desired, despaired, and hated her. His sensual eye had gloated on her cheek Even till the flush of angry modesty Gave it new charms, and made him gloat the more. She loathed the man, for Hamuel's eye was bold, And the strong workings of brute selfishness Had moulded his broad features; and she fear'd The bitterness of wounded vanity That with a fiendish hue would overcast His faint and lying smile. Nor vain her fear, For Hamuel vow'd revenge, and laid a plot Against her virgin fame. He spread abroad Whispers that travel fast, and ill reports That soon obtain belief; how Zillah's eye, When in the temple heaven-ward it was raised, Did swim with rapturous zeal, but there were those Who had beheld the enthusiast's melting glance With other feelings fill'd; . . that 'twas a task Of easy sort to play the saint by day Before the public eye, but that all eyes Were closed at night; . . that Zillah's life was foul, Yea, forfeit to the law. Shame.. shame to man, That he should trust so easily the tongue Which stabs another's fame! The ill report Was heard, repeated, and believed, . . and soon, For Hamuel by his well-schemed villainy Produced such semblances of guilt, . . the Maid Was to the fire condemn'd. Without the walls, There was a barren field; a place abhorr'd, For it was there where wretched criminals Receiv'd their death; and there they fix'd the stake, And piled the fuel round, which should consume The injured Maid, abandon'd, as it seem'd, By God and Man. The assembled Bethlemites Beheld the scene, and when they saw the Maid Bound to the stake, with what calm holiness She lifted up her patient looks to Heaven, They doubted of her guilt. With other thoughts Stood Hamuel near the pile; him savage joy Led thitherward, but now within his heart Unwonted feelings stirr'd, and the first pangs Of wakening guilt, anticipant of Hell. The eye of Zillah as it glanced around Fell on the slanderer once, and rested there A moment; like a dagger did it pierce, And struck into his soul a cureless wound. Conscience! thou God within us! not in the hour Of triumph dost thou spare the guilty wretch, Not in the hour of infamy and death Forsake the virtuous! They draw near the stake, . . They bring the torch! . . . hold, hold your erring hands! Yet quench the rising flames! . . they rise! they spread! They reach the suffering Maid! oh God protect The innocent one! They rose, they spread, they raged; . . . The breath of God went forth; the ascending fire Beneath its influence bent, and all its flames In one long lightning-flash concentrating, Darted and blasted Hamuel, . . him alone. Hark! . . what a fearful scream the multitude Pour forth! . . and yet more miracles! the stake Branches and buds, and, spreading its green leaves, Embowers and canopies the innocent Maid Who there stands glorified; and Roses, then First seen on earth since Paradise was lost, Profusely blossom round her, white and red In all their rich variety of hues; And fragrance such as our first parents breathed In Eden she inhales, vouchsafed to her A presage sure of Paradise regain'd. Westbury, 1798. THE LOVER'S ROCK. The Maiden through the favouring night From Granada took her flight, She bade her father's house farewell, And fled away with Manuel. No Moorish maid might hope to vie With Laila's cheek or Laila's eye, No maiden loved with purer truth, Or ever loved a lovelier youth. In fear they fled across the plain, The father's wrath, the captive's chain; In hope to Seville on they flee, To peace, and love, and liberty. Chiuma they have left, and now, Beneath a precipice's brow, Where Guadalhorce winds its way, There in the shade awhile they lay; For now the sun was near its height, And she was weary with her flight; She laid her head on Manuel's breast, And pleasant was the maiden's rest. While thus the lovely Laila slept, A fearful watch young Manuel kept, Alas! her Father and his train He sees come speeding o'er the plain. The Maiden started from her sleep, They sought for refuge up the steep, To scale the precipice's brow Their only hope of safety now. But them the angry Father sees, With voice and arm he menaces, And now the Moors approach the steep, Loud are his curses, loud and deep. Then Manuel's heart grew wild with woe, He loosen'd stones and roll'd below, He loosen'd crags, for Manuel strove For life, and liberty, and love. The ascent was perilous and high, The Moors they durst not venture nigh, The fugitives stood safely there, They stood in safety and despair. The Moorish chief unmoved could see His daughter bend her suppliant knee; He heard his child for pardon plead, And swore the offenders both should bleed. He bade the archers bend the bow, And make the Christian fall below; He bade the archers aim the dart, And pierce the Maid's apostate heart. The archers aim'd their arrows there, She clasp'd young Manuel in despair, “Death, Manuel, shall set us free! Then leap below and die with me.” He clasp'd her close and cried farewell, In one another's arms they fell; And falling o'er the rock's steep side, In one another's arms they died. And side by side they there are laid, The Christian youth and Moorish maid; But never Cross was planted there, Because they perish'd for despair. Yet every Moorish maid can tell Where Laila lies who loved so well, And every youth who passes there, Says for Manuel's soul a prayer. Westbury, 1798. GARCI FERRANDEZ. PART I. 1. In an evil day and an hour of woe Did Garci Ferrandez wed! He wedded the Lady Argentine, As ancient stories tell, He loved the Lady Argentine, Alas! for what befell! The Lady Argentine hath fled; In an evil day and an hour of woe She hath left the husband who loved her well, To go to Count Aymerique's bed. 2. Garci Ferrandez was brave and young, The comeliest of the land; There was never a knight of Leon in fight Who could meet the force of his matchless might; There was never a foe in the infidel band Who against his dreadful sword could stand; And yet Count Garci's strong right hand Was shapely, and soft, and white; As white and as soft as a lady's hand Was the hand of the beautiful knight. 3. In an evil day and an hour of woe To Garci's Hall did Count Aymerique go; In an evil hour and a luckless night From Garci's Hall did he take his flight, And bear with him that lady bright, That lady false, his bale and bane. There was feasting and joy in Count Aymerique's bower, When he with triumph, and pomp, and pride, Brought home the adult'ress like a bride: His daughter only sate in her tower, She sate in her lonely tower alone, And for her dead mother she made her moan; “Methinks,” said she, “my father for me Might have brought a bridegroom home. A stepmother he brings hither instead, Count Aymerique will not his daughter should wed, But he brings home a leman for his own bed.” So thoughts of good and thoughts of ill Were working thus in Abba's will; And Argentine with evil intent Ever to work her woe was bent; That still she sate in her tower alone, And in that melancholy gloom, When for her mother she made her moan, She wish'd her father too in the tomb. 4. She watches the pilgrims and poor who wait For daily food at her father's gate. “I would some Knight were there,” thought she, “Disguised in pilgrim-weeds for me! For Aymerique's blessing I would not stay, Nor he nor his leman should say me nay, But I with him would wend away.” 5. She watches her handmaid the pittance deal, They took their dole and went away; But yonder is one who lingers still As though he had something in his will, Some secret which he fain would say; And close to the portal she sees him go, He talks with her handmaid in accents low; Oh then she thought that time went slow, And long were the minutes that she must wait Till her handmaid came from the castle-gate. 6. From the castle-gate her handmaid came, And told her that a Knight was there, Who sought to speak with Abba the fair, Count Aymerique's beautiful daughter and heir. She bade the stranger to her bower; His stature was tall, his features bold A goodlier form might never maid At tilt or tourney hope to see; And though in pilgrim-weeds arrayed, Yet noble in his weeds was he, And did his arms in them enfold As they were robes of royalty. 7. He told his name to the high-born fair, He said that vengeance led him there “Now aid me, lady dear,” quoth he, “To smite the adultress in her pride; Your wrongs and mine avenged shall be, And I will take you for my bride.” He pledged the word of a true Knight, From out the weeds his hand he drew; She took the hand that Garci gave, And then she knew his tale was true, For she saw the warrior's hand so white, And she knew the fame of the beautiful Knight. PART II. 1. 'Tis the hour of noon, The bell of the convent hath done, And the Sexts are begun; The Count and his leman are gone to their meat. They look to their pages, and lo they see Where Abba, a stranger so long before, The ewer, and bason, and napkin bore; She came and knelt on her bended knee, And first to her father minister'd she; Count Aymerique look'd on his daughter down, He look'd on her then without a frown. 2. And next to the Lady Argentine Humbly she went and knelt; The Lady Argentine the while A haughty wonder felt; Her face put on an evil smile; “I little thought that I should see The Lady Abba kneel to me In service of love and courtesy! Count Aymerique,” the leman cried, “Is she weary of her solitude, Or hath she quell'd her pride?” Abba no angry word replied, She only raised her eyes and cried, “Let not the Lady Argentine Be wroth at ministry of mine!” She look'd at Aymerique and sigh'd; “My father will not frown, I ween, That Abba again at his board should be seen!” Then Aymerique raised her from her knee, And kiss'd her eyes, and bade her be The daughter she was wont to be. 3. The wine hath warm'd Count Aymerique, That mood his crafty daughter knew; She came and kiss'd her father's cheek, And stroked his beard with gentle hand, And winning eye and action bland, As she in childhood used to do. “A boon! Count Aymerique,” quoth she; “If I have found favour in thy sight, Let me sleep at my father's feet to-night. Grant this,” quoth she, “so I shall see That you will let your Abba be The daughter she was wont to be.” With asking eye did Abba speak, Her voice was soft and sweet; The wine had warm'd Count Aymerique, And when the hour of rest was come, She lay at her father's feet. 4. In Aymerique's arms the adult'ress lay, Their talk was of the distant day, How they from Garci fled away In the silent hour of night; And then amid their wanton play They mock'd the beautiful Knight. Far, far away his castle lay, The weary road of many a day; “And travel long,” they said, “to him, It seem'd, was small delight; And he belike was loth with blood To stain his hands so white.” They little thought that Garci then Heard every scornful word! They little thought the avenging hand Was on the avenging sword! Fearless, unpenitent, unblest, Without a prayer they sunk to rest, The adulterer on the leman's breast. 5. Then Abba, listening still in fear, To hear the breathing long and slow, At length the appointed signal gave, And Garci rose and struck the blow. One blow sufficed for Aymerique, . . He made no moan, he utter'd no groan; But his death-start waken'd Argentine, And by the chamber-lamp she saw The bloody falchion shine! She raised for help her in-drawn breath, But her shriek of fear was her shriek of death. 6. In an evil day and an hour of woe Did Garci Ferrandez wed! One wicked wife he has sent to her grave, He hath taken a worse to his bed. Bristol, 1801. KING RAMIRO 1. Green grow the alder-trees, and close To the water-side by St. Joam da Foz. From the castle of Gaya the Warden sees The water and the alder-trees; And only these the Warden sees, No danger near doth Gaya fear, No danger nigh doth the Warden spy; He sees not where the gallies lie Under the alders silently; For the gallies with green are cover'd o'er, They have crept by night along the shore, And they lie at anchor, now it is morn, Awaiting the sound of Ramiro's horn. 2. In traveller's weeds Ramiro sate By the fountain at the castle-gate; But under the weeds was his breast-plate, And the sword he had tried in so many fights, And the horn whose sound would ring around, And be known so well by his knights. 3. From the gate Aldonza's damsel came To fill her pitcher at the spring, And she saw, but she knew not, her master the King. In the Moorish tongue Ramiro spake, And begg'd a draught for mercy's sake, That he his burning thirst might slake; For worn by a long malady, Not strength enow, he said, had he To lift it from the spring. 4. She gave her pitcher to the King, And from his mouth he dropt a ring Which he had with Aldonza broken; So in the water from the spring Queen Aldonza found the token. With that she bade her damsel bring Secretly the stranger in. 5. “What brings thee hither, Ramiro?” she cried: “The love of you,” the King replied. “Nay! nay! it is not so!” quoth she, “Ramiro, say not this to me! I know your Moorish concubine Hath now the love which once was mine. If you had loved me as you say, You would never have stolen Ortiga away, If you had never loved another, I had not been here in Gaya to-day The wife of Ortiga's brother! But hide thee here, . . a step I hear, . . King Alboazar draweth near.” 6. In her alcove she bade him hide: “King Alboazar, my lord,” she cried, “What wouldst thou do, if at this hour King Ramiro were in thy power?” “This I would do,” the Moor replied, “I would hew him limb from limb, As he, I know, would deal by me, So I would deal by him.” “Alboazar!” Queen Aldonza said, “Lo! here I give him to thy will; In yon alcove thou hast thy foe, Now thy vengeance then fulfil!” 7. With that up spake the Christian king: “O Alboazar, deal by me As I would surely deal with thee, If I were you, and you were me! Like a friend you guested me many a day, Like a foe I stole your sister away; The sin was great, and I felt its weight, All joy by day the thought opprest, And all night long it troubled my rest; Till I could not bear the burthen of care, But told my Confessor in despair. And he, my sinful soul to save, This penance for atonement gave; That I before you should appear And yield myself your prisoner here, If my repentance was sincere, That I might by a public death Breathe shamefully out my latest breath. 8. “King Alboazar, this I would do, If you were I, and I were you; That no one should say you were meanly fed, I would give you a roasted capon first, And a good ring loaf of wheaten bread, And a skinful of wine to quench your thirst; And after that I would grant you the thing Which you came to me petitioning. Now this, O King, is what I crave, That I my sinful soul may save: Let me be led to your bull-ring, And call your sons and daughters all, And assemble the people both great and small, And let me be set upon a stone, That by all the multitude I may be known, And bid me then this horn to blow, And I will blow a blast so strong, And wind the horn so loud and long That the breath in my body at last shall be gone, And I shall drop dead in sight of the throng. Thus your revenge, O King, will be brave, Granting the boon which I come to crave, And the people a holyday sight will have, And I my precious soul shall save; For this is the penance my Confessor gave. King Alboazar, this I would do, If you were I, and I were you.” 9. “This man repents his sin, be sure!” To Queen Aldonza said the Moor; “He hath stolen my sister away from me, I have taken from him his wife; Shame then would it be when he comes to me, And I his true repentance see, If I for vengeance should take his life.” 10. “O Alboazar!” then quoth she, “Weak of heart as weak can be! Full of revenge and wiles is he. Look at those eyes beneath that brow, I know Ramiro better than thou! Kill him, for thou hast him now, He must die, be sure, or thou. Hast thou not heard the history How, to the throne that he might rise, He pluck'd out his brother Ordoño's eyes? And dost not remember his prowess in fight, How often he met thee and put thee to flight, And plunder'd thy country for many a day; And how many Moors he has slain in the strife, And how many more carried captives away? How he came to show friendship.. and thou didst believe him? How he ravish'd thy sister, . . and wouldst thou forgive him? And hast thou forgotten that I am his wife, And that now by thy side I lie like a bride, The worst shame that can ever a Christian betide? And cruel it were when you see his despair, If vainly you thought in compassion to spare, And refused him the boon he comes hither to crave, For no other way his poor soul can he save, Than by doing the penance his Confessor gave.” 11. As Queen Aldonza thus replies, The Moor upon her fixed his eyes, And he said in his heart, unhappy is he Who putteth his trust in a woman! Thou art King Ramiro's wedded wife, And thus wouldst thou take away his life! What cause have I to confide in thee? I will put this woman away from me. These were the thoughts that pass'd in his breast, But he call'd to mind Ramiro's might; And he fear'd to meet him hereafter in fight, And he granted the King's request. 12. So he gave him a roasted capon first, And a skinful of wine to quench his thirst; And he call'd for his sons and daughters all, And assembled the people both great and small; And to the bull-ring he led the king; And he set him there upon a stone, That by all the multitude he might be known, And he bade him blow through his horn a blast, As long as his breath and his life should last. 13. Oh then his horn Ramiro wound: The walls rebound the pealing sound, That far and wide rings echoing round; Louder and louder Ramiro blows, And farther the blast and farther goes; Till it reaches the gallies where they lie close Under the alders, by St. Joam da Foz. It roused his knights from their repose And they and their merry men arose. Away to Gaya they speed them straight; Like a torrent they burst through the city gate; And they rush among the Moorish throng, And slaughter their infidel foes. 14. Then his good sword Ramiro drew, Upon the Moorish King he flew, And he gave him one blow, for there needed not two; They killed his sons and his daughters too; Every Moorish soul they slew; Not one escaped of the infidel crew; Neither old nor young, nor babe nor mother; And they left not one stone upon another. 15. They carried the wicked Queen aboard, And they took counsel what to do to her; They tied a millstone round her neck, And overboard in the sea they threw her. But a heavier weight than that millstone lay On Ramiro's soul at his dying day. Bristol, 1802. THE INCHCAPE ROCK No stir in the air, no stir in the sea, The ship was still as she could be, Her sails from heaven received no motion, Her keel was steady in the ocean. Without either sign or sound of their shock The waves flow'd over the Inchcape Rock; So little they rose, so little they fell, They did not move the Inchcape Bell. The Abbot of Aberbrothok Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock; On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung, And over-the waves its warning rung. When the Rock was hid by the surge's swell, The mariners heard the warning bell; And then they knew the perilous Rock, And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok. The Sun in heaven was shining gay, All things were joyful on that day; The sea-birds scream'd as they wheel'd round, And there was joyaunce in their sound. The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen A darker speck on the ocean green; Sir Ralph the Rover walk'd his deck, And he fix'd his eye on the darker speck. He felt the cheering power of spring, It made him whistle, it made him sing; His heart was mirthful to excess, But the Rover's mirth was wickedness. His eye was on the Inchcape float; Quoth he, “My men, put out the boat, And row me to the Inchcape Rock, And I'll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok.” The boat is lower'd, the boatmen row, And to the Inchcape Rock they go; Sir Ralph bent over from the boat, And he cut the Bell from the Inchcape float. Down sunk the Bell with a gurgling sound, The bubbles rose and burst around; Quoth Sir Ralph, “The next who comes to the Rock Wo'n't bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok.” Sir Ralph the Rover sail'd away, He scour'd the seas for many a day; And now grown rich with plunder'd store, He steers his course for Scotland's shore. So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky They cannot see the Sun on high; The wind hath blown a gale all day, At evening it hath died away. On the deck the Rover takes his stand, So dark it is they see no land. Quoth Sir Ralph, “It will be lighter soon, For there is the dawn of the rising Moon.” “Canst hear,” said one, “the breakers roar? For methinks we should be near the shore.” “Now where we are I cannot tell, But I wish I could hear the Inchcape Bell.” They hear no sound, the swell is strong; Though the wind hath fallen they drift along, Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock,— “Oh Christ! it is the Inchcape Rock!” Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair; He curst himself in his despair; The waves rush in on every side, The ship is sinking beneath the tide. But even in his dying fear One dreadful sound could the Rover hear, A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell, The Devil below was ringing his knell. Bristol, 1802. THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE. A Well there is in the west country, And a clearer one never was seen; There is not a wife in the west country But has heard of the Well of St. Keyne. An oak and an elm tree stand beside, And behind doth an ash-tree grow, And a willow from the bank above Droops to the water below. A traveller came to the Well of St. Keyne; Joyfully he drew nigh, For from cock-crow he had been travelling, And there was not a cloud in the sky. He drank of the water so cool and clear, For thirsty and hot was he, And he sat down upon the bank Under the willow-tree. There came a man from the house hard by At the Well to fill his pail; On the Well-side he rested it, And he bade the Stranger hail “Now art thou a bachelor, Stranger?” quoth he, “For an if thou hast a wife, The happiest draught thou hast drank this day That ever thou didst in thy life. “Or has thy good woman, if one thou hast, Ever here in Cornwall been? For an if she have, I'll venture my life She has drank of the Well of St. Keyne.” “I have left a good woman who never was here,” The Stranger he made reply, “But that my draught should be the better for that, I pray you answer me why?” “St. Keyne,” quoth the Cornish-man, “many a time Drank of this crystal Well, And before the Angel summon'd her, She laid on the water a spell. “If the Husband of this gifted Well Shall drink before his Wife, A happy man thenceforth is he, For he shall be Master for life. “But if the Wife should drink of it first, . . God help the Husband then!” The Stranger stoopt to the Well of St. Keyne, And drank of the water again. “You drank of the Well I warrant betimes?” He to the Cornish-man said: But the Cornish-man smiled as the Stranger spake, And sheepishly shook his head. “I hasten'd as soon as the wedding was done, And left my Wife in the porch; But i' faith she had been wiser than me, For she took a bottle to Church.” Westbury, 1798. BISHOP BRUNO. Bishop Bruno awoke in the dead midnight, And he heard his heart beat loud with affright: He dreamt he had rung the Palace bell, And the sound it gave was his passing knell. Bishop Bruno smiled at his fears so vain, He turned to sleep and he dreamt again; He rang at the palace gate once more, And Death was the Porter that open'd the door. He started up at the fearful dream, And he heard at his window the screech-owl scream; Bishop Bruno slept no more that night, . . Oh! glad was he when he saw the day-light! Now he goes forth in proud array, For he with the Emperor dines to-day; There was not a Baron in Germany That went with a nobler train than he. Before and behind his soldiers ride, The people throng'd to see their pride; They bow'd the head, and the knee they bent, But nobody blest him as he went. So he went on stately and proud, When he heard a voice that cried aloud, “Ho! ho! Bishop Bruno! you travel with glee, . . But I would have you know, you travel to me!” Behind and before and on either side, He look'd, but nobody he espied; And the Bishop at that grew cold with fear, For he heard the words distinct and clear. And when he rang at the Palace bell, He almost expected to hear his knell; And when the Porter turn'd the key, He almost expected Death to see. But soon the Bishop recover'd his glee, For the Emperor welcomed him royally; And now the tables were spread, and there Were choicest wines and dainty fare. And now the Bishop had blest the meat, When a voice was heard as he sat in his seat, . . “With the Emperor now you are dining with glee, But know, Bishop Bruno! you sup with me!” The Bishop then grew pale with affright, And suddenly lost his appetite; All the wine and dainty cheer Could not comfort his heart that was sick with fear But by little and little recovered he, For the wine went flowing merrily, Till at length he forgot his former dread, And his cheeks again grew rosy red. When he sat down to the royal fare Bishop Bruno was the saddest man there But when the masquers enter'd the hall, He was the merriest man of all. Then from amid the masquers' crowd There went a voice hollow and loud, . . “You have past the day, Bishop Bruno, in glee; But you must pass the night with me!” His cheek grows pale, and his eye-balls glare, And stiff round his tonsure bristled his hair; With that there came one from the masquers' band, And took the Bishop by the hand. The bony hand suspended his breath, His marrow grew cold at the touch of Death; On saints in vain he attempted to call, Bishop Bruno fell dead in the palace hall. Westbury, 1798. THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM. 1 It was a summer evening, Old Kaspar's work was done, And he before his cottage door Was sitting in the sun, And by him sported on the green His little grandchild Wilhelmine. 2 She saw her brother Peterkin Roll something large and round, Which he beside the rivulet In playing there had found; He came to ask what he had found, That was so large, and smooth, and round. 3 Old Kaspar took it from the boy, Who stood expectant by; And then the old man shook his head, And with a natural sigh, “'Tis some poor fellow's skull,” said he, “Who fell in the great victory. 4 “I find them in the garden, For there's many here about; And often when I go to plough, The ploughshare turns them out! For many thousand men,” said he, “Were slain in that great victory.” 5 “Now tell us what 'twas all about,” Young Peterkin, he cries; And little Wilhelmine looks up With wonder-waiting eyes; “Now tell us all about the war, And what they fought each other for.” 6 “It was the English,” Kaspar cried, “Who put the French to rout; But what they fought each other for, I could not well make out; But every body said,” quoth he, “That 'twas a famous victory. 7 “My father lived at Blenheim then, Yon little stream hard by; They burnt his dwelling to the ground, And he was forced to fly; So with his wife and child he fled, Nor had he where to rest his head. 8 “With fire and sword the country round Was wasted far and wide, And many a childing mother then, And new-born baby died; But things like that, you know, must be At every famous victory. 9 “They say it was a shocking sight After the field was won; For many thousand bodies here Lay rotting in the sun; But things like that, you know, must be After a famous victory. 10 “Great praise the Duke of Marlbro' won, And our good Prince Eugene.” ‘Why 'twas a very wicked thing!” Said little Wilhelmine. “Nay . . nay . . my little girl,” quoth he, “It was a famous victory. 11 “And every body praised the Duke Who this great fight did win.” “But what good came of it at last?” Quoth little Peterkin. “Why that I cannot tell,” said he, “But 'twas a famous victory.” Westbury, 1798. A TRUE BALLAD OF ST. ANTIDIUS, THE POPE, AND THE DEVIL. It is Antidius the Bishop Who now at even tide, Taking the air and saying a prayer, Walks by the river side. The Devil had business that evening, And he upon earth would go; For it was in the month of August, And the weather was close below. He had his books to settle, And up to earth he hied, To do it there in the evening air, All by the river side. His imps came flying around him, Of his affairs to tell; From the north, and the south, and the east, and the west; They brought him the news that he liked best, Of the things they had done, And the souls they had won, And how they sped well In the service of Hell. There came a devil posting in Return'd from his employ, Seven years had he been gone from Hell, And now he came grinning for joy. “Seven years,” quoth he, “of trouble and toil Have I labour'd the Pope to win; And I to-day have caught him, He hath done a deadly sin!” And then he took the Devil's book, And wrote the deed therein. Oh, then King Beelzebub for joy, He drew his mouth so wide, You might have seen his iron teeth, Four and forty from side to side. He wagg'd his ears, he twisted his tail, He knew not for joy what to do, In his hoofs and his horns, in his heels and his corns, It tickled him all through. The Bishop who beheld all this, Straight how to act bethought him; He leapt upon the Devil's back, And by the horns he caught him. And he said a Pater-noster As fast as he could say, And made a cross on the Devil's head, And bade him to Rome away. Away, away, the Devil flew, All through the clear moonlight; I warrant who saw them on their way He did not sleep that night. Without bridle, or saddle, or whip, or spur, Away they go like the wind; The beads of the Bishop are hanging before, And the tail of the Devil behind. They met a Witch and she hail'd them As soon as she came within call; “Ave Maria!” the Bishop exclaim'd, It frightened her broomstick and she got a fall. He ran against a shooting star, So fast for fear did he sail, And he singed the beard of the Bishop Against a Comet's tail; And he pass'd between the horns of the Moon, With Antidius on his back; And there was an eclipse that night, Which was not in the Almanack. The Bishop just as they set out, To tell his beads begun; And he was by the bed of the Pope Before the string was done. The Pope fell down upon his knees, In terror and confusion, And he confess'd the deadly sin, And he had absolution. And all the Popes in bliss that be, Sung, O be joyful! then; And all the Popes in bale that be, They howl'd for envy then; For they before kept jubilee, Expecting his good company, Down in the Devil's den. But what was this the Pope had done To bind his soul to Hell? Ah! that is the mystery of this wonderful history, And I wish that I could tell! But would you know, there you must go, You can easily find the way; It is a broad and a well-known road That is travell'd by night and by day. And you must look in the Devil's book; You will find one debt that was never paid yet If you search the leaves throughout; And that is the mystery of this wonderful history, And the way to find it out. Bristol, 1802. GONZALO HERMIGUEZ. 1. In arms and in anger, in struggle and strife, Gonzalo Hermiguez won his wife; He slew the Moor who from the fray Was rescuing Fatima that day; In vain she shriek'd: Gonzalo prest The Moorish prisoner to his breast; That breast in iron was array'd, The gauntlet was bloody that graspt the Maid; Through the bever-sight his eye Glared fierce and red and wrathfully, And while he bore the captive away His heart rejoiced, and he blest the day. 2. Under the lemon walk's odorous shade Gonzalo Hermiguez wooed the Maid; The ringlets of his raven hair Waved upon the evening air, And gentle thoughts that raise a sigh Soften'd the warrior's dark-brown eye, When he with passion and sweet song Wooed her to forgive the wrong; Till she no more could say him nay, And the Moorish Maiden blest the day When Gonzalo bore her a captive away. 3. To the holy Church with pomp and pride Gonzalo Hermiguez led his bride. In the sacred font that happy day Her stain of sin was wash'd away; There did the Moorish Maiden claim Another faith, another name; There as a Christian convert plight Her faith unto the Christian Knight, And Oriana blest the day When Gonzalo bore her a captive away. 4. Of Affonso Henriques' court the pride Were Gonzalo Hermiguez and his bride; In battle strongest of the strong, In peace the master of the song, Gonzalo of all was first in fame, The loveliest she and the happiest dame. But ready for her heavenly birth She was not left to fade on earth; In that dread hour with Heaven in view, The comfort of her faith she knew, And blest on her death-bed the day When Gonzalo bore her a captive away. 5. Through a long and holy life Gonzalo Hermiguez mourn'd his wife. The arms wherewith he won his bride, Sword shield and lance, were laid aside. That head which the high-plumed helm had worn Was now of its tresses shaven and shorn, A Monk of Alcobaca he Eminent for sanctity. Contented in his humble cell The meekest of the meek to dwell, His business was by night and day For Oriana's soul to pray. Never day did he let pass But scored to her account a mass; Devoutly for the dear one dead With self-inflicted stripes he bled; This was Gonzalo's sole employ, This was Gonzalo's only joy; Till love thus purified became A holy, yea, a heavenly flame; And now in Heaven both bless the day When he bore the Moorish captive away. Bristol, 1801. QUEEN ORRACA, AND THE FIVE MARTYRS OF MOROCCO. 1. The Friars five have girt their loins, And taken staff in hand; And never shall those Friars again Hear mass in Christian land. They went to Queen Orraca, To thank her and bless her then; And Queen Orraca in tears Knelt to the holy men. “Three things, Queen Orraca, We prophesy to you: Hear us, in the name of God! For time will prove them true. “In Morocco we must martyr'd be; Christ hath vouchsafed it thus: We shall shed our blood for Him Who shed his blood for us. “To Coimbra shall our bodies be brought, Such being the will divine; That Christians may behold and feel Blessings at our shrine. “And when unto that place of rest Our bodies shall draw nigh, Who sees us first, the King or you, That one that night must die. “Fare thee well, Queen Orraca! For thy soul a mass we will say, Every day as long as we live, And on thy dying day.” The Friars they blest her, one by one, Where she knelt on her knee, And they departed to the land Of the Moors beyond the sea. 2. “What news, O King Affonso, What news of the Friars five? Have they preach'd to the Miramamolin; And are they still alive?” “They have fought the fight, O Queen! They have run the race; In robes of white they hold the palm Before the throne of Grace. “All naked in the sun and air Their mangled bodies lie; What Christian dared to bury them, By the bloody Moors would die.” 3. “What news, O King Affonso, Of the Martyrs five what news? Doth the bloody Miramamolin Their burial still refuse?” “That on a dunghill they should rot, The bloody Moor decreed; That their dishonour'd bodies should The dogs and vultures feed: “But the thunder of God roll'd over them, And the lightning of God flash'd round; Nor thing impure, nor man impure, Could approach the holy ground. “A thousand miracles appall'd The cruel Pagan's mind; Our brother Pedro brings them here, In Coimbra to be shrined.” 4. Every altar in Coimbra Is drest for the festival day; All the people in Coimbra Are dight in their richest array; Every bell in Coimbra Doth merrily, merrily, ring; The Clergy and the Knights await, To go forth with the Queen and the King. “Come forth, come forth, Queen Orraca! We make the procession stay.” “I beseech thee, King Affonso, Go you alone to-day. “I have pain in my head this morning, I am ill at heart also: Go without me, King Affonso, For I am too faint to go.” “The relics of the Martyrs five All maladies can cure; They will requite the charity You shew'd them once, be sure: “Come forth then, Queen Orraca You make the procession stay: It were a scandal and a sin To abide at home to-day.” Upon her palfrey she is set, And for ward then they go; And over the long bridge they pass, And up the long hill wind slow. “Prick forward, King Affonso, And do not wait for me; To meet them close by Coimbra, It were discourtesy; “A little while I needs must wait, Till this sore pain be gone; . . . I will proceed the best I can, But do you and your Knights prick on.” The King and his Knights prick'd up the hill Faster than before; The King and his Knights have topt the hill, And now they are seen no more. As the King and his Knights went down the hill A wild boar crost the way; “Follow him! follow him!” cried the King; “We have time by the Queen's delay!” A-hunting of the boar astray Is King Affonso gone: Slowly, slowly, but straight the while, Queen Orraca is coming on. And winding now the train appears Between the olive-trees: Queen Orraca alighted then, And fell upon her knees. The Friars of Alanquer came first, And next the relics past; . . . Queen Orraca look'd to see The King and his Knights come last. She heard the horses tramp behind; At that she turn'd her face: King Affonso and his Knights came up All panting from the chase. “Have pity upon my poor soul, Holy Martyrs five!” cried she: “Holy Mary, Mother of God, Virgin, pray for me!” 5. That day in Coimbra Many a heart was gay; But the heaviest heart in Coimbra, Was that poor Queen's that day. The festival is over, The sun hath sunk in the west; All the people in Coimbra Have betaken themselves to rest. Queen Orraca's Father Confessor At midnight is awake; Kneeling at the Martyrs' shrine, And praying for her sake. Just at the midnight hour, when all Was still as still could be, Into the Church of Santa Cruz, Came a saintly company: All in robes of russet grey, Poorly were they dight; Each one girdled with a cord, Like a Friar Minorite. But from those robes of russet grey, There flow'd a heavenly light; For each one was the blessed soul Of a Friar Minorite. Brighter than their brethren, Among the beautiful band; Five were there who each did bear A palm branch in his hand. He who led the brethren, A living man was he; And yet he shone the brightest Of all the company. Before the steps of the altar, Each one bow'd his head; And then with solemn voice they sung The Service of the Dead. “And who are ye, ye blessed Saints?' The Father Confessor said; “And for what happy soul sing ye The Service of the Dead?” “These are the souls of our brethren in bliss, The Martyrs five are we: And this is our father Francisco, Among us bodily. “We are come hither to perform Our promise to the Queen; Go thou to King Affonso, And say what thou hast seen.” There was loud knocking at the door, As the heavenly vision fled; And the porter called to the Confessor, To tell him the Queen was dead. Bristol, 1803. THE OLD WOMAN OF BERKELEY, A BALLAD, SHEWING HOW AN OLD WOMAN RODE DOUBLE, AND WHO RODE BEFORE HER. The Raven croak'd as she sate at her meal, And the Old Woman knew what he said, And she grew pale at the Raven's tale, And sicken'd and went to her bed. “Now fetch me my children, and fetch them with speed,” The Old Woman of Berkeley said, “The Monk my son, and my daughter the Nun, Bid them hasten or I shall be dead.” The Monk her son, and her daughter the Nun, Their way to Berkeley went, And they have brought with pious thought The holy sacrament. The Old Woman shriek'd as they enter'd her door, And she cried with a voice of despair, “Now take away the sacrament, For its presence I cannot bear!” Her lip it trembled with agony, The sweat ran down her brow, “I have tortures in store for evermore, But spare me, my children, now!” Away they sent the sacrament, The fit it left her weak, She look'd at her children with ghastly eyes, And faintly struggled to speak. “All kind of sin I have rioted in, And the judgement now must be, But I secured my children's souls, Oh! pray, my children, for me! “I have 'nointed myself with infant's fat, The fiends have been my slaves, From sleeping babes I have suck'd the breath, And breaking by charms the sleep of death, I have call'd the dead from their graves. “And the Devil will fetch me now in fire, My witchcrafts to atone; And I who have troubled the dead mans grave Shall never have rest in my own. “Bless, I entreat, my winding sheet, My children, I beg of you; And with holy water sprinkle my shroud, And sprinkle my coffin too. “And let me be chain'd in my coffin of stone, And fasten it strong, I implore, With iron bars, and with three chains, Chain it to the church floor. “And bless the chains and sprinkle them, And let fifty Priests stand round, Who night and day the mass may say Where I lie on the ground. “And see that fifty Choristers Beside the bier attend me, And day and night by the tapers' light, With holy hymns defend me. “Let the church bells all both great and small, Be toll'd by night and day, To drive from thence the fiends who come To bear my body away. “And ever have the church door barr'd After the even-song; And I beseech you, children dear, Let the bars and bolts be strong. “And let this be three days and nights My wretched corpse to save; Till the fourth morning keep me safe, And then I may rest in my grave.” The Old Woman of Berkeley laid her down, And her eyes grew deadly dim, Short came her breath, and the struggle of death Did loosen every limb. They blest the old woman's winding sheet With rites and prayers due, With holy water they sprinkled her shroud, And they sprinkled her coffin too. And they chain'd her in her coffin of stone, And with iron barr'd it down, And in the church with three strong chains They chain'd it to the ground. And they blest the chains and sprinkled them, And fifty Priests stood round, By night and day the mass to say Where she lay on the ground. And fifty sacred Choristers Beside the bier attend her, Who day and night by the tapers' light Should with holy hymns defend her. To see the Priests and Choristers It was a goodly sight, Each holding, as it were a staff, A taper burning bright. And the church bells all both great and small, Did toll so loud and long; And they have barr'd the church door hard, After the even-song. And the first night the tapers' light Burnt steadily and clear, But they without a hideous rout Of angry fiends could hear; A hideous roar at the church door Like a long thunder peal; And the priests they pray'd, and the choristers sung Louder in fearful zeal. Loud toll'd the bell, the priests pray'd well, The tapers they burnt bright, The Monk her son, and her daughter the Nun, They told their beads all night. The cock he crew, the Fiends they flew From the voice of the morning away; Then undisturb'd the Choristers sing, And the fifty Priests they pray; As they had sung and pray'd all night They pray'd and sung all day. The second night the tapers' light Burnt dismally and blue, And every one saw his neighbour's face Like a dead man's face to view. And yells and cries without arise That the stoutest heart might shock, And a deafening roaring like a cataract pouring Over a mountain rock. The Monk and Nun they told their beads As fast as they could tell, And aye as louder grew the noise The faster went the bell. Louder and louder the Choristers sung As they trembled more and more, And the Priests as they pray'd to heaven for aid, They smote their breasts full sore. The cock he crew, the Fiends they flew From the voice of the morning away; Then undisturb'd the Choristers sing, And the fifty Priests they pray; As they had sung and pray'd all night They pray'd and sung all day. The third night came, and the tapers' flame A frightful stench did make; And they burnt as though they had been dipt In the burning brimstone lake. And the loud commotion, like the rushing of ocean, Grew momently more and more; And strokes as of a battering ram, Did shake the strong church door. The bellmen, they for very fear Could toll the bell no longer; And still as louder grew the strokes, Their fear it grew the stronger. The Monk and Nun forgot their beads, They fell on the ground in dismay; There was not a single Saint in heaven To whom they did not pray. And the Choristers' song, which late was so strong, Falter'd with consternation, For the church did rock as an earthquake shock Uplifted its foundation. And a sound was heard like the trumpet's blast, That shall one day wake the dead; The strong church door could bear no more, And the bolts and the bars they fled; And the tapers' light was extinguish'd quite, And the choristers faintly sung, And the Priests dismay'd, panted and pray'd, And on all Saints in heaven for aid They call'd with trembling tongue. And in He came with eyes of flame, The Devil to fetch the dead, And all the church with his presence glow'd Like a fiery furnace red. He laid his hand on the iron chains, And like flax they moulder'd asunder, And the coffin lid, which was barr'd so firm, He burst with his voice of thunder. And he bade the Old Woman of Berkeley rise, And come with her master away; A cold sweat started on that cold corpse, At the voice she was forced to obey. She rose on her feet in her winding sheet, Her dead flesh quiver'd with fear, And a groan like that which the Old Woman gave Never did mortal hear. She follow'd her Master to the church door, There stood a black horse there; His breath was red like furnace smoke, His eyes like a meteor's glare. The Devil he flung her on the horse, And he leapt up before, And away like the lightning's speed they went, And she was seen no more. They saw her no more, but her cries For four miles round they could hear, And children at rest at their mothers' breast Started, and scream'd with fear. Hereford, 1798. THE SURGEON'S WARNING. The Doctor whisper'd to the Nurse, And the Surgeon knew what he said; And he grew pale at the Doctor's tale, And trembled in his sick-bed. “Now fetch me my brethren, and fetch them with speed,” The Surgeon affrighted said; “The Parson and the Undertaker, Let them hasten or I shall be dead.” The Parson and the Undertaker They hastily came complying, And the Surgeon's Prentices ran up stairs When they heard that their Master was dying. The Prentices all they enter'd the room, By one, by two, by three; With a sly grin came Joseph in, First of the company. The Surgeon swore as they enter'd his door, 'Twas fearful his oaths to hear, . . “Now send these scoundrels out of my sight, I beseech ye, my brethren dear!” He foam'd at the mouth with the rage he felt, And he wrinkled his black eye-brow, “That rascal Joe would be at me, I know, But zounds, let him spare me now!” Then out they sent the Prentices, The fit it left him weak, He look'd at his brothers with ghastly eyes, And faintly struggled to speak. “All kinds of carcases I have cut up, And now my turn will be; But, brothers, I took care of you, So pray take care of me. “I have made candles of dead men's fat, The Sextons have been my slaves, I have bottled babes unborn, and dried Hearts and livers from rifled graves. “And my Prentices now will surely come And carve me bone from bone, And I who have rifled the dead man's grave Shall never have rest in my own. “Bury me in lead when I am dead, My brethren, I entreat, And see the coffin weigh'd, I beg, Lest the plumber should be a cheat. “And let it be solder'd closely down, Strong as strong can be, I implore; And put it in a patent coffin, That I may rise no more. “If they carry me off in the patent coffin, Their labour will be in vain; Let the Undertaker see it bought of the maker, Who lives by St. Martin's Lane. “And bury me in my brother's church, For that will safer be; And I implore, lock the church door, And pray take care of the key. “And all night long let three stout men The vestry watch within; To each man give a gallon of beer, And a keg of Holland's gin; “Powder and ball and blunderbuss, To save me if he can, And eke five guineas if he shoot A Resurrection Man. “And let them watch me for three weeks, My wretched corpse to save; For then I think that I may stink Enough to rest in my grave.” The Surgeon laid him down in his bed, His eyes grew deadly dim, Short came his breath, and the struggle of death Did loosen every limb. They put him in lead when he was dead, And with precaution meet, First they the leaden coffin weigh, Lest the plumber should be a cheat. They had it solder'd closely down, And examin'd it o'er and o'er, And they put it in a patent coffin That he might rise no more. For to carry him off in a patent coffin, Would, they thought, be but labour in vain, So the Undertaker saw it bought of the maker. Who lives by St. Martin's Lane. In his brother's church they buried him, That safer he might be; They lock'd the door, and would not trust The Sexton with the key. And three men in the vestry watch To save him if they can, And should he come there to shoot they swear A Resurrection Man. And the first night by lanthorn light Through the church-yard as they went, A guinea of gold the Sexton shew'd That Mister Joseph sent. But conscience was tough, it was not enough, And their honesty never swerved, And they bade him go with Mister Joe To the Devil as he deserved. So all night long by the vestry fire They quaff'd their gin and ale, And they did drink, as you may think, And told full many a tale. The Cock he crew cock-a-doodle-doo, Past five! the watchmen said; And they went away, for while it was day They might safely leave the dead. The second night by lanthorn light Through the church-yard as they went, He whisper'd anew, and shew'd them two That Mister Joseph sent. The guineas were bright and attracted their sight, They look'd so heavy and new, And their fingers itch'd as they were bewitch'd, And they knew not what to do. But they waver'd not long, for conscience was strong And they thought they might get more, And they refused the gold, but not So rudely as before. So all night long by the vestry fire They quaff'd their gin and ale, And they did drink, as you may think, And told full many a tale. The third night as by lanthorn light Through the church-yard they went, He bade them see, and shew'd them three That Mister Joseph sent. They look'd askaunce with greedy glance, The guineas they shone bright, For the Sexton on the yellow gold Let fall his lanthorn light. And he look'd sly with his roguish eye, And gave a well-timed wink, And they could not stand the sound in his hand, For he made the guineas chink. And conscience, late that had such weight, All in a moment fails, For well they knew that it was true A dead man tells no tales. And they gave all their powder and ball, And took the gold so bright, And they drank their beer and made good cheer, Till now it was midnight. Then, though the key of the church-door Was left with the Parson, his brother, It open'd at the Sexton's touch, . . . Because he had another. And in they go with that villain Joe, To fetch the body by night, And all the church look'd dismally By his dark-lanthorn light. They laid the pick-axe to the stones, And they moved them soon asunder; They shovell'd away the hard-prest clay, And came to the coffin under. They burst the patent coffin first, And they cut through the lead; And they laugh'd aloud when they saw the shroud, Because they had got at the dead. And they allow'd the Sexton the shroud, And they put the coffin back; And nose and knees they then did squeeze The Surgeon in a sack. The watchmen as they past along Full four yards off could smell, And a curse bestow'd upon the load So disagreeable. So they carried the sack a-pick-a-back, And they carved him bone from bone, But what became of the Surgeon's soul Was never to mortal known. Westbury, 1798. HENRY THE HERMIT. It was a little island where he dwelt, A solitary islet, bleak and bare, Short scanty herbage spotting with dark spots Its grey stone surface. Never mariner Approach'd that rude and uninviting coast, Nor ever fisherman his lonely bark Anchor'd beside its shore. It was a place Befitting well a rigid anchoret, Dead to the hopes and vanities and joys, And purposes of life: and he had dwelt Many long years upon that lonely isle; For in ripe manhood he abandon'd arms, Honours and friends and country and the world, And had grown old in solitude. That isle Some solitary man in other times Had made his dwelling-place; and Henry found The little chapel which his toil had built Now by the storms unroof'd, his bed of leaves Wind-scatter'd; and his grave o'ergrown with grass, And thistles, whose white seeds there wing'd in vain, Wither'd on rocks, or in the waves were lost. So he repair'd the chapel's ruin'd roof, Clear'd the grey lichens from the altar-stone, And underneath a rock that shelter'd him From the sea-blast, he built his hermitage. The peasants from the shore would bring him food, And beg his prayers; but human converse else He knew not in that utter solitude; Nor ever visited the haunts of men, Save when some sinful wretch on a sick bed Implored his blessing and his aid in death. That summons he delay'd not to obey, Though the night-tempest or autumnal wind Madden'd the waves; and though the mariner, Albeit relying on his saintly load, Grew pale to see the peril. Thus he lived A most austere and self-denying man, Till abstinence and age and watchfulness Had worn him down, and it was pain at last To rise at midnight from his bed of leaves And bend his knees in prayer. Yet not the less, Though with reluctance of infirmity, Rose he at midnight from his bed of leaves And bent his knees in prayer; but with more zeal, More self-condemning fervour, raised his voice Imploring pardon for the natural sin Of that reluctance, till the atoning prayer Had satisfied his heart, and given it peace, And the repented fault became a joy. One night upon the shore his chapel-bell Was heard; the air was calm, and its far sounds Over the water came, distinct and loud. Alarm'd at that unusual hour to hear Its toll irregular, a monk arose, And crost to the island-chapel. On a stone Henry was sitting there, dead, cold, and stiff, The bell-rope in his hand, and at his feet The lamp This story is related in the English Martyrology, 1608. that stream'd a long unsteady light. Westbury, 1799. ST. GUALBERTO. ADDRESSED TO GEORGE BURNETT. 1 The work is done, the fabric is complete; Distinct the Traveller sees its distant tower, Yet ere his steps attain the sacred seat, Must toil for many a league and many an hour. Elate the Abbot sees the pile and knows, Stateliest of convents now, his new Moscera rose. 2 Long were the tale that told Moscera's pride, Its columns cluster'd strength and lofty state, How many a saint bedeck'd its sculptured side, What intersecting arches graced its gate; Its towers how high, its massy walls how strong, These fairly to describe were sure a tedious song. 3 Yet while the fane rose slowly from the ground, But little store of charity, I ween, The passing pilgrim at Moscera found; And often there the mendicant was seen Hopeless to turn him from the convent-door, Because this costly work still kept the brethren poor. 4 Now all is finish'd, and from every side They flock to view the fabric, young and old. Who now can tell Rodulfo's secret pride, When on the Sabbath-day his eyes behold The multitudes that crowd his church's floor, Some sure to serve their God, to see Moscera more. 5 So chanced it that Gualberto pass'd that way, Since sainted for a life of saintly deeds. He paused the new-rear'd convent to survey, And o'er the structure whilst his eye proceeds, Sorrowed, as one whose holier feelings deem That ill so proud a pile did humble monks beseem. 6 Him, musing as he stood, Rodulfo saw, And forth he came to greet the holy guest; For him he knew as one who held the law Of Benedict, and each severe behest So duly kept with such religious care, That Heaven had oft vouchsafed its wonders to his prayer. 7 “Good brother, welcome!” thus Rodulfo cries, “In sooth it glads me to behold you here; It is Gualberto! and mine aged eyes Did not deceive me: yet full many a year Hath slipt away, since last you bade farewell To me your host and my uncomfortable cell. 8 “'Twas but a sorry welcome then you found, And such as suited ill a guest so dear. The pile was ruinous, the base unsound; It glads me more to bid you welcome here, For you can call to mind our former state; Come, brother, pass with me the new Moscera's gate.” 9 So spake the cheerful Abbot, but no smile Of answering joy relax'd Gualberto's brow; He raised his hand and pointed to the pile, “Moscera better pleased me then, than now; A palace this, befitting kingly pride! Will holiness, my friend, in palace pomp abide?” 10 “Aye,” cries Rudolfo, “'tis a stately place! And pomp becomes the House of Worship well. Nay, scowl not round with so severe a face! When earthly kings in seats of grandeur dwell, Where art exhausted decks the sumptuous hall, Can poor and sordid huts beseem the Lord of all?” 11 “And ye have rear'd these stately towers on high To serve your God?” the Monk severe replied; “It rose from zeal and earnest piety, And prompted by no worldly thoughts beside? Abbot, to him who prays with soul sincere However poor the cell, God will incline his ear. 12 “Rodulfo! while this haughty building rose, Still was the pilgrim welcome at your door? Did charity relieve the orphan's woes? Clothed ye the naked? did ye feed the poor? He who with alms most succours the distrest, Proud Abbot! know he serves his heavenly Father best. 13 “Did they in sumptuous palaces go dwell Who first abandon'd all to serve the Lord? Their place of worship was the desart cell, Wild fruits and berries spread their frugal board, And if a brook, like this, ran murmuring by, They blest their gracious God, and ‘thought it luxury.’” 14 Then anger darken'd in Rodulfo's face; “Enough of preaching,” sharply he replied, “Thou art grown envious; . . 'tis a common case, Humility is made the cloak of pride. Proud of our home's magnificence are we, But thou art far more proud in rags and beggary.” 15 With that Gualberto cried in fervent tone, “O, Father, hear me! If this costly pile Was for thine honour rear'd, and thine alone, Bless it, O Father, with thy fostering smile! Still may it stand, and never evil know, Long as beside its walls the endless stream shall flow 16 “But, Lord, if vain and worldly-minded men Have wasted here the wealth which thou hast lent, To pamper worldly pride; frown on it then! Soon be thy vengeance manifestly sent! Let yonder brook, that gently flows beside, Now from its base sweep down the unholy house of pride!” 17 He said, . . and lo, the brook no longer flows! The waters pause, and now they swell on high; Erect in one collected heap they rose; The affrighted brethren from Moscera fly, And upon all the Saints in Heaven they call, To save them in their flight from that impending fall. 18 Down the heapt waters came, and with a sound Like thunder, overthrown the fabric falls; Swept far and wide its fragments strew the ground, Prone lie its columns now, its high-arch'd walls, Earth shakes beneath the onward-rolling tide, That from its base swept down the unholy house of pride. 19 Were old Gualberto's reasons built on truth, Dear George, or like Moscera's base unsound? This sure I know, that glad am I, in sooth, He only play'd his pranks on foreign ground; For had he turn'd the stream on England too, The Vandal monk had spoilt full many a goodly view. 20 Then Malmesbury's arch had never met my sight, Nor Battle's vast and venerable pile; I had not traversed then with such delight The hallowed ruins of our Alfred's isle, Where many a pilgrim's curse is well bestow'd On those who rob its walls to mend the turnpike road. 21 Wells would have fallen, dear George, our country's pride; And Canning's stately church been rear'd in vain; Nor had the traveller Ely's tower descried, Which when thou seest far o'er the fenny plain, Dear George, I counsel thee to turn that way, Its ancient beauties sure will well reward delay. 22 And we should never then have heard, I think, At evening hour, great Tom's tremendous knell. The fountain streams that now in Christ-church stink, Had niagara'd o'er the quadrangle; But, as 'twas beauty that deserved the flood, I ween, dear George, thy own old Pompey might have stood. 23 Then had not Westminster, the house of God, Served for a concert-room, or signal-post; Old Thames, obedient to the father's nod, Had swept down Greenwich, England's noblest boast; And, eager to destroy the unholy walls, Fleet-ditch had roll'd up hill to overwhelm St. Paul's. 24 George, dost thou deem the legendary deeds Of saints like this but rubbish, a mere store Of trash, that he flings time away who reads? And would'st thou rather bid me puzzle o'er Matter and Mind and all the eternal round, Plunged headlong down the dark and fathomless profound? 25 Now do I bless the man who undertook These Monks and Martyrs to biographize; And love to ponder o'er his ponderous book, The mingle-mangle mass of truth and lies, Where waking fancies mixt with dreams appear, And blind and honest zeal, and holy faith sincere. 26 All is not truth; and yet, methinks, 'twere hard Of wilful fraud such fablers to accuse; What if a Monk, from better themes debarr'd, Should for an edifying story chuse, How some great Saint the Flesh and Fiend o'ercame, His taste I trow, and not his conscience, were to blame. 27 No fault of his, if what he thus design'd, Like pious novels for the use of youth, Obtain'd such hold upon the simple mind That was received at length for gospel-truth. A fair account! and should'st thou like the plea, Thank thou our valued friend, dear George, who taught it me. 28 All is not false which seems at first a lie. Fernan Antolinez a Spanish knight, Knelt at the mass, when lo! the troops hard by Before the expected hour began the fight. Though courage, duty, honour, summon'd there, He chose to forfeit all, not leave the unfinish'd prayer. 29 But while devoutly thus the unarm'd knight Waits till the holy service should be o'er, Even then the foremost in the furious fight Was he beheld to bathe his sword in gore; First in the van his plumes were seen to play, And all to him decreed the glory of the day. 30 The truth is told, and men at once exclaim, Heaven had his Guardian Angel deign'd to send; And thus the tale is handed down to fame. Now if our good Sir Fernan had a friend Who in this critical season served him well, Dear George, the tale is true, and yet no miracle. 31 I am not one who scan with scornful eyes The dreams which make the enthusiast's best delight; Nor thou the legendary lore despise If of Gualberto yet again I write, How first impell'd he sought the convent-cell; A simple tale it is, but one that pleased me well. 32 Fortune had smiled upon Gualberto's birth, The heir of Valdespesa's rich domains; An only child, he grew in years and worth, And well repaid a father's anxious pains. In many a field that father had been tried, Well for his valour known, and not less known for pride. 33 It chanced that one in kindred near allied Was slain by his hereditary foe; Much by his sorrow moved and more by pride, The father vow'd that blood for blood should flow, And from his youth Gualberto had been taught That with unceasing hate should just revenge be sought. 34 Long did they wait; at length the tidings came That through a lone and unfrequented way, Soon would Anselmo, such the murderer's name, Pass on his journey home, an easy prey. “Go,” said the father, “meet him in the wood!” And young Gualberto went, and laid in wait for blood. 35 When now the youth was at the forest shade Arrived, it drew toward the close of day; Anselmo haply might be long delay'd, And he, already wearied with his way, Beneath an ancient oak his limbs reclined And thoughts of near revenge alone possess'd his mind. 36 Slow sunk the glorious sun; a roseate light Spread o'er the forest from his lingering rays; The glowing clouds upon Gualberto's sight Soften'd in shade, . . he could not chuse but gaze; And now a placid greyness clad the heaven, Save where the west retain'd the last green light of even. 37 Cool breathed the grateful air, and fresher now The fragrance of the autumnal leaves arose; The passing gale scarce moved the o'erhanging bough, And not a sound disturb'd the deep repose, Save when a falling leaf came fluttering by, Save the near brooklet's stream that murmur'd quietly. 38 Is there who has not felt the deep delight, The hush of soul, that scenes like these impart? The heart they will not soften is not right, And young Gualberto was not hard of heart. Yet sure he thinks revenge becomes him well, When from a neighbouring church he heard the vesper-bell. 39 The Romanist who hears that vesper-bell, Howe'er employ'd, must send a prayer to Heaven. In foreign lands I liked the custom well, For with the calm and sober thoughts of even It well accords; and wert thou journeying there, It would not hurt thee, George, to join that vesper-prayer. 40 Gualberto had been duly taught to hold All pious customs with religious care; And, . . for the young man's feelings were not cold, He never yet had miss'd his vesper-prayer. But strange misgivings now his heart invade, And when the vesper-bell had ceased he had not pray'd. 41 And wherefore was it that he had not pray'd? The sudden doubt arose within his mind, And many a former precept then he weigh'd The words of Him who died to save mankind; How 'twas the meek who should inherit Heaven, And man must man forgive, if he would be forgiven. 42 Troubled at heart, almost he felt a hope, That yet some chance his victim might delay. So as he mused adown the neighbouring slope He saw a lonely traveller on his way; And now he knows the man so much abhorr'd, . . His holier thoughts are gone, he bares the murderous sword. 43 “The house of Valdespesa gives the blow! Go, and our vengeance to our kinsman tell!” . . Despair and terror seized the unarm'd foe, And prostrate at the young man's knees he fell, And stopt his hand and cried, “Oh, do not take A wretched sinner's life! mercy, for Jesus' sake!” 44 At that most blessed name, as at a spell, Conscience, the power within him, smote his heart. His hand, for murder raised, unharming fell; He felt cold sweat-drops on his forehead start; A moment mute in holy horror stood, Then cried, “Joy, joy, my God! I have not shed his blood!” 45 He raised Anselmo up, and bade him live, And bless, for both preserved, that holy name: And pray'd the astonish'd foeman to forgive The bloody purpose led by which he came. Then to the neighbouring church he sped away, His over-burden'd soul before his God to lay. 46 He ran with breathless speed, . . he reach'd the door, With rapid throbs his feverish pulses swell; . . He came to crave for pardon, to adore For grace vouchsafed; before the cross he fell, And raised his swimming eyes, and thought that there He saw the imaged Christ smile favouring on his prayer. 47 A blest illusion! from that very night The Monk's austerest life devout he led; And still he felt the enthusiast's deep delight, Seraphic visions floated round his head, The joys of heaven foretasted fill'd his soul, And still the good man's name adorns the sainted roll. Westbury, 1799. THE MARCH TO MOSCOW. 1. The Emperor Nap he would set off On a summer excursion to Moscow; The fields were green, and the sky was blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! What a pleasant excursion to Moscow! 2. Four hundred thousand men and more Must go with him to Moscow: There were Marshals by the dozen, And Dukes by the score; Princes a few, and Kings one or two; While the fields are so green, and the sky so blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! What a pleasant excursion to Moscow! 3. There was Junot and Augereau, Heigh-ho for Moscow! Dombrowsky and Poniatowsky, Marshal Ney, lack-a-day! General Rapp and the Emperor Nap; Nothing would do While the fields were so green, and the sky so blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! Nothing would do For the whole of this crew, But they must be marching to Moscow. 4. The Emperor Nap he talk'd so big That he frighten'd Mr. Roscoe. John Bull, he cries, if you'll be wise, Ask the Emperor Nap if he will please To grant you peace upon your knees, Because he is going to Moscow! He'll make all the Poles come out of their holes, And beat the Russians and eat the Prussians, For the fields are green, and the sky is blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! And he'll certainly march to Moscow! 5. And Counsellor Brougham was all in a fume At the thought of the march to Moscow: The Russians, he said, they were undone, And the great Fee-Faw-Fum Would presently come With a hop, step, and jump unto London. For as for his conquering Russia, However some persons might scoff it, Do it he could, and do it he would, And from doing it nothing would come but good, And nothing could call him off it. Mr. Jeffrey said so, who must certainly know, For he was the Edinburgh Prophet. They all of them knew Mr. Jeffrey's Review, Which with Holy Writ ought to be reckon'd: It was through thick and thin to its party true; Its back was buff, and its sides were blue Morbleu! Parbleu! It served them for Law and for Gospel too. 6. But the Russians stoutly they turned-to Upon the road to Moscow. Nap had to fight his way all through; They could fight, though they could not parlez-vous, But the fields were green, and the sky was blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! And so he got to Moscow. 7. He found the place too warm for him, For they set fire to Moscow. To get there had cost him much ado, And then no better course he knew, While the fields were green, and the sky was blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! But to march back again from Moscow. 8. The Russians they stuck close to him All on the road from Moscow. There was Tormazow and Jemalow And all the others that end in ow; Milarodovitch and Jaladovitch And Karatschkowitch, And all the others that end in itch; Schamscheff, Souchosaneff, And Schepaleff, And all the others that end in eff; Wasiltschikoff, Kostomaroff, And Tchoglokoff, And all the others that end in off; Rajeffsky and Novereffsky And Rieffsky, And all the others that end in effsky; Oscharoffsky and Rostoffsky, And all the others that end in offsky; And Platoff he play'd them off, And Shouvaloff he shovell'd them off, And Markoff he mark'd them off, And Krosnoff he cross'd them off, And Tuchkoff he touch'd them off, And Boroskoff he bored them off, And Kutousoff he cut them off, And Parenzoff he pared them off, And Worronzoff he worried them off, And Doctoroff he doctor'd them off, And Rodionoff he flogg'd them off. And last of all an Admiral came, A terrible man with a terrible name, A name which you all know by sight very well; But which no one can speak, and no one can spell. They stuck close to Nap with all their might, They were on the left and on the right, Behind and before, and by day and by night, He would rather parlez-vous than fight; But he look'd white and he look'd blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! When parlez-vous no more would do, For they remember'd Moscow. 9. And then came on the frost and snow All on the road from Moscow. The wind and the weather he found in that hour Cared nothing for him nor for all his power; For him who, while Europe crouch'd under his rod, Put his trust in his Fortune, and not in his God. Worse and worse every day the elements grew The fields were so white and the sky so blue, Sacrebleu! Ventrebleu! What a horrible journey from Moscow 10. What then thought the Emperor Nap Upon the road from Moscow? Why, I ween he thought it small delight To fight all day, and to freeze all night: And he was besides in a very great fright, For a whole skin he liked to be in; And so, not knowing what else to do, When the fields were so white and the sky so blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! He stole away, I tell you true, Upon the road from Moscow. 'Tis myself, quoth he, I must mind most; So the Devil may take the hindmost. 11. Too cold upon the road was he, Too hot had he been at Moscow; But colder and hotter he may be, For the grave is colder than Moscovy: And a place there is to be kept in view Where the fire is red and the brimstone blue, Morbleu! Parbleu! Which he must go to, If the Pope say true. If he does not in time look about him; Where his namesake almost He may have for his Host, He has reckon'd too long without him, If that host get him in Purgatory, He won't leave him there alone with his glory; But there he must stay for a very long day, For from thence there is no stealing away As there was on the road from Moscow. Keswick, 1813. BROUGH BELLS. One day to Helbeck I had stroll'd Among the Crossfell hills, And resting in its rocky grove Sat listening to the rills; The while to their sweet undersong The birds sang blithe around, And the soft west wind awoke the wood To an intermitting sound. Louder or fainter as it rose, Or died away, was borne The harmony of merry bells, From Brough that pleasant morn. “Why are the merry bells of Brough, My friend, so few?” said I, “They disappoint the expectant ear, Which they should gratify. “One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four; 'Tis still one, two, three, four, Mellow and silvery are the tones; But I wish the bells were more!” “What! art thou critical?” quoth he; “Eschew that heart's disease That seeketh for displeasure where The intent hath been to please. “By those four bells there hangs a tale, Which being told, I guess, Will make thee hear their scanty peal With proper thankfulness. “Not by the Cliffords were they given, Nor by the Tuftons' line; Thou hearest in that peal the crune Of old John Brunskill's kine. On Stanemore's side one summer eve, John Brunskill sate to see His herds in yonder Borrodale Come winding up the lea. “Behind them on the lowland's verge, In the evening light serene; Brough's silent tower, then newly built By Blenkinsop, was seen. “Slowly they came in long array, With loitering pace at will; At times a low from them was heard, Far off, for all was still. “The hills return'd that lonely sound Upon the tranquil air; The only sound it was, which then Awoke the echoes there. “‘Thou hear'st that lordly Bull of mine, Neighbour,’ quoth Brunskill then; ‘How loudly to the hills he crunes, That crune to him again. “‘Thinkest thou if yon whole herd at once Their voices should combine, Were they at Brough, that we might not Hear plainly from this upland spot That cruning of the kine?’ “‘That were a crune, indeed,’ replied His comrade, ‘which, I ween, Might at the Spital well be heard, And in all dales between. “‘Up Mallerstang to Eden's springs, The eastern wind upon its wings The mighty voice would bear; And Appleby would hear the sound, Methinks, when skies are fair.’ “‘Then shall the herd,’ John Brunskill cried, ‘From yon dumb steeple crune, And thou and I, on this hill-side, Will listen to their tune. “‘So while the merry Bells of Brough, For many an age ring on, John Brunskill will remember'd be, When he is dead and gone; “‘As one who in his latter years, Contented with enough, Gave freely what he well could spare To buy the Bells of Brough.’ “Thus it hath proved: three hundred years Since then have past away, And Brunskill's is a living name Among us to this day.” “More pleasure,” I replied, “shall I From this time forth partake, When I remember Helbeck woods, For old John Brunskill's sake. “He knew how wholesome it would be, Among these wild wide fells, And upland vales, to catch, at times, The sound of Christian bells; “What feelings and what impulses Their cadence might convey, To herdsman or to shepherd boy, Whiling in indolent employ The solitary day; “That when his brethren were convened To meet for social prayer, He too, admonish'd by the call In spirit might be there. “Or when a glad thanksgiving sound, Upon the winds of Heaven, Was sent to speak a Nation's joy, For some great blessing given— “For victory by sea or land, And happy peace at length; Peace by his country's valour won, And 'stablish'd by her strength; “When such exultant peals were borne Upon the mountain air, The sound should stir his blood, and give An English impulse there.” Such thoughts were in the old man's mind, When he that eve look'd down From Stanemore's side on Borrodale, And on the distant town. And had I store of wealth, methinks, Another herd of kine, John Brunskill, I would freely give, That they might crune with thine. Keswick, 1828. QUEEN MARY'S CHRISTENING. The first wish of Queen Mary's heart Is, that she may bear a son, Who shall inherit in his time The kingdom of Aragon. She hath put up prayers to all the Saints This blessing to accord, But chiefly she hath call'd upon The Apostles of our Lord. The second wish of Queen Mary's heart Is to have that son call'd James, Because she thought for a Spanish King 'Twas the best of all good names. To give him this name of her own will Is what may not be done, For having applied to all the Twelve She may not prefer the one. By one of their names she hath vow'd to call Her son, if son it should be; But which, is a point whereon she must let The Apostles themselves agree. Already Queen Mary hath to them Contracted a grateful debt, And from their patronage she hoped For these farther blessings yet. Alas! it was not her hap to be As handsome as she was good; And that her husband King Pedro thought so She very well understood. She had lost him from her lawful bed For lack of personal graces, And by prayers to them, and a pious deceit, She had compass'd his embraces. But if this hope of a son should fail, All hope must fail with it then, For she could not expect by a second device To compass the King again. Queen Mary hath had her first heart's wish— She hath brought forth a beautiful boy; And the bells have rung, and masses been sung, And bonfires have blazed for joy. And many's the cask of the good red wine, And many the cask of the white, Which was broach'd for joy that morning, And emptied before it was night. But now for Queen Mary's second heart's wish, It must be determined now, And Bishop Boyl, her Confessor, Is the person who taught her how. Twelve waxen tapers he hath had made, In size and weight the same; And to each of these twelve tapers, He hath given an Apostle's name. One holy Nun had bleach'd the wax, Another the wicks had spun; And the golden candlesticks were blest, Which they were set upon. From that which should burn the longest, The infant his name must take; And the Saint who own'd it was to be His Patron for his name's sake. A godlier or a goodlier sight Was nowhere to be seen, Methinks, that day, in Christendom, Than in the chamber of that good Queen. Twelve little altars have been there Erected, for the nonce; And the twelve tapers are set thereon, Which are all to be lit at once. Altars more gorgeously drest You nowhere could desire; At each there stood a minist'ring Priest In his most rich attire. A high altar hath there been raised, Where the crucifix you see; And the sacred Pix that shines with gold And sparkles with jewelry. Bishop Boyl, with his precious mitre on, Hath taken there his stand, In robes which were embroidered By the Queen's own royal hand. In one part of the ante-room The Ladies of the Queen, All with their rosaries in hand, Upon their knees are seen. In the other part of the ante-room The Chiefs of the realm you behold, Ricos Omes, and Bishops and Abbots, And Knights and Barons bold. Queen Mary could behold all this As she lay in her state bed; And from the pillow needed not To lift her languid head. One fear she had, though still her heart The unwelcome thought eschew'd, That haply the unlucky lot Might fall upon St. Jude. But the Saints, she trusted, that ill chance Would certainly forefend; And moreover there was a double hope Of seeing the wish'd-for end: Because there was a double chance For the best of all good names; If it should not be Santiago himself, It might be the lesser St. James. And now Bishop Boyl hath said the mass; And as soon as the mass was done, The priests who by the twelve tapers stood Each instantly lighted one. The tapers were short and slender too, Yet to the expectant throng, Before they to the socket burnt, The time, I trow, seem'd long. The first that went out was St. Peter, The second was St. John; And now St. Matthias is going, And now St. Matthew is gone. Next there went St. Andrew, There goes St. Philip too; And see! there is an end Of St. Bartholomew. St. Simon is in the snuff; But it was a matter of doubt Whether he or St. Thomas could be said Soonest to have gone out. There are only three remaining, St. Jude, and the two St. James; And great was then Queen Mary's hope For the best of all good names. Great was then Queen Mary's hope, But greater her fear, I guess, When one of the three went out, And that one was St. James the Less. They are now within less than quarter-inch, The only remaining two! When there came a thief in St. James, And it made a gutter too! Up started Queen Mary, Up she sate in her bed: “I never can call him Judas!” She claspt her hands and said. “I never can call him Judas!” Again did she exclaim; “Holy Mother preserve us! It is not a Christian name!” She spread her hands and claspt them again, And the Infant in the cradle Set up a cry, an angry cry, As loud as he was able. “Holy Mother preserve us!” The Queen her prayer renew'd; When in came a moth at the window And flutter'd about St. Jude. St. James hath fallen in the socket But as yet the flame is not out, And St. Jude hath singed the silly moth That flutters so blindly about. And before the flame and the molten wax That silly moth could kill, It hath beat out St. Jude with its wings, And St. James is burning still! Oh, that was a joy for Queen Mary's heart; The babe is christened James; The Prince of Aragon hath got The best of all good names! Glory to Santiago, The mighty one in war! James he is call'd, and he shall be King James the Conqueror! Now shall the Crescent wane, The Cross be set on high In triumph upon many a Mosque; Woe, woe to Mawmetry! Valencia shall be subdued; Majorca shall be won; The Moors be routed every where; Joy, joy, for Aragon! Shine brighter now, ye stars, that crown Our Lady del Pilar. And rejoice in thy grave, Cid Campeador, Ruydiez de Bivar! Keswick, 1829. ROPRECHT THE ROBBER. PART I. Roprecht the Robber is taken at last, In Cologne they have him fast; Trial is over, and sentence past; And hopes of escape were vain he knew, For the gallows now must have its due. But though pardon cannot here be bought, It may for the other world, he thought; And so to his comfort, with one consent The Friars assured their penitent. Money, they teach him, when rightly given, Is put out to account with Heaven; For suffrages therefore his plunder went, Sinfully gotten, but piously spent. All Saints, whose shrines are in that city, They tell him, will on him have pity, Seeing he hath liberally paid, In this time of need, for their good aid. In the Three Kings they bid him confide, Who there in Cologne lie side by side; And from the Eleven Thousand Virgins eke, Intercession for him will they bespeak. And also a sharer he shall be In the merits of their community; All which they promise, he need not fear, Through Purgatory will carry him clear. Though the furnace of Babylon could not compare With the terrible fire that rages there, Yet they their part will so zealously do He shall only but frizzle as he flies through. And they will help him to die well, And he shall be hang'd with book and bell; And moreover with holy water they Will sprinkle him, ere they turn away. For buried Roprecht must not be, He is to be left on the triple tree; That they who pass along may spy Where the famous Robber is hanging on high. Seen is that gibbet far and wide From the Rhine and from the Dusseldorff side; And from all roads which cross the sand, North, south, and west, in that level land. It will be a comfortable sight To see him there by day and by night; For Roprecht the Robber many a year Had kept the country round in fear. So the Friars assisted, by special grace, With book and bell to the fatal place; And he was hang'd on the triple tree, With as much honour as man could be. In his suit of irons he was hung, They sprinkled him then, and their psalm they sung; And turning away when this duty was paid, They said what a goodly end he had made. The crowd broke up and went their way; All were gone by the close of day; And Roprecht the Robber was left there Hanging alone in the moonlight air. The last who look'd back for a parting sight, Beheld him there in the clear moonlight; But the first who look'd when the morning shone, Saw in dismay that Roprecht was gone. PART II. The stir in Cologne is greater to-day Than all the bustle of yesterday; Hundreds and thousands went out to see; The irons and chains, as well as he, Were gone, but the rope was left on the tree. A wonderful thing! for every one said He had hung till he was dead, dead, dead; And on the gallows was seen, from noon Till ten o'clock, in the light of the moon. Moreover the Hangman was ready to swear He had done his part with all due care; And that certainly better hang'd than he No one ever was, or ever could be. Neither kith nor kin, to bear him away And funeral rites in secret pay, Had he and none that pains would take, With risk of the law, for a stranger's sake. So 'twas thought, because he had died so well He was taken away by miracle. But would he again alive be found? Or had he been laid in holy ground? If in holy ground his relics were laid, Some marvellous sign would show, they said; If restored to life, a Friar he would be, Or a holy Hermit certainly, And die in the odour of sanctity. That thus it would prove they could not doubt, Of a man whose end had been so devout; And to disputing then they fell About who had wrought this miracle. Had the Three Kings this mercy shown, Who were the pride and honour of Cologne? Or was it an act of proper grace, From the Army of Virgins of British race, Who were also the glory of that place? Pardon, some said, they might presume, Being a kingly act, from the Kings must come; But others maintained that St. Ursula's heart Would sooner be moved to the merciful part. There was one who thought this aid divine Came from the other bank of the Rhine; For Roprecht there too had for favour applied, Because his birth-place was on that side. To Dusseldorff then the praise might belong, And its Army of Martyrs, ten thousand strong; But he for a Dusseldorff man was known, And no one would listen to him in Cologne, Where the people would have the whole wonder their own. The Friars, who help'd him to die so well, Put in their claim to the miracle; Greater things than this, as their Annals could tell, The stock of their merits for sinful men Had done before, and would do again. 'Twas a whole week's wonder in that great town, And in all places, up the river and down: But a greater wonder took place of it then, For Roprecht was found on the gallows again! PART III. With that the whole city flocked out to see; There Roprecht was on the triple tree, Dead, past all doubt, as dead could be; But fresh he was as if spells had charm'd him, And neither wind nor weather had harm'd him. While the multitude stood in a muse, One said, I am sure he was hang'd in shoes! In this the Hangman and all concurr'd; But now, behold, he was booted and spurr'd! Plainly therefore it was to be seen, That somewhere on horseback he had been; And at this the people marvelled more, Than at any thing which had happened before. For not in riding trim was he When he disappeared from the triple tree; And his suit of irons he still was in, With the collar that clipp'd him under the chin. With that this second thought befell, That perhaps he had not died so well, Nor had Saints perform'd the miracle; But rather there was cause to fear, That the foul Fiend had been busy here! Roprecht the Robber had long been their curse, And hanging had only made him worse; For bad as he was when living, they said They had rather meet him alive than dead. What a horse must it be which he had ridden, No earthly beast could be so bestridden; And when by a hell-horse a dead rider was carried, The whole land would be fearfully harried! So some were for digging a pit in the place, And burying him there with a stone on his face; And that hard on his body the earth should be press'd, And exorcists be sent for to lay him at rest. But others, whose knowledge was greater, opined That this corpse was too strong to be confined; No weight of earth which they could lay Would hold him down a single day, If he chose to get up and ride away. There was no keeping Vampires under ground; And bad as a Vampire he might be found, Pests against whom it was understood Exorcism never had done any good. But fire, they said, had been proved to be The only infallible remedy; So they were for burning the body outright, Which would put a stop to his riding by night. Others were for searching the mystery out, And setting a guard the gallows about, Who should keep a careful watch, and see Whether Witch or Devil it might be That helped him down from the triple tree. For that there were Witches in the land, Was what all by this might understand; And they must not let the occasion slip For detecting that cursed fellowship. Some were for this, and some for that, And some they could not tell for what: And never was such commotion known In that great city of Cologne. PART IV. Pieter Snoye was a boor of good renown, Who dwelt about an hour and a half from the town: And he, while the people were all in debate, Went quietly in at the city gate. For Father Kijf he sought about, His confessor, till he found him out; But the Father Confessor wondered to see The old man, and what his errand might be. The good Priest did not wonder less When Pieter said he was come to confess; “Why, Pieter, how can this be so? I confessed thee some ten days ago! Thy conscience, methinks, may be well at rest, An honest man among the best; I would that all my flock, like thee, Kept clear accounts with Heaven and me!” Always before, without confusion, Being sure of easy absolution, Pieter his little slips had summ'd; But he hesitated now, and he haw'd, and humm'd. And something so strange the Father saw In Pieter's looks, and his hum and his haw, That he began to doubt it was something more Than a trifle omitted in last week's score. At length it came out, that in the affair Of Roprecht the Robber he had some share; The Confessor then gave a start in fear— “God grant there have been no witchcraft here!” Pieter Snoye, who was looking down, With something between a smile and a frown, Felt that suspicion move his bile, And look'd up with more of a frown than a smile. “Fifty years I, Pieter Snoye, Have lived in this country, man and boy, And have always paid the Church her due, And kept short scores with Heaven and you. The Devil himself, though Devil he be, Would not dare impute that sin to me; He might charge me as well with heresy: And if he did, here, in this place, I'd call him liar, and spit in his face!” The Father, he saw, cast a gracious eye When he heard him thus the Devil defy; The wrath, of which he had eased his mind, Left a comfortable sort of warmth behind, Like what a cheerful cup will impart, In a social hour, to an honest man's heart: And he added, “For all the witchcraft here, I shall presently make that matter clear. Though I am, as you very well know, Father Kijf, A peaceable man, and keep clear of strife, It's a queerish business that now I've been in; But I can't say that it's much of a sin. However, it needs must be confess'd, And as it will set this people at rest, To come with it at once was best: Moreover, if I delayed, I thought That some might perhaps into trouble be brought. Under the seal I tell it you, And you will judge what is best to do, That no hurt to me and my son may ensue. No earthly harm have we intended, And what was ill done, has been well mended. I and my son Piet Pieterszoon, Were returning home by the light of the moon, From this good city of Cologne, On the night of the execution day; And hard by the gibbet was our way. About midnight it was we were passing by, My son Piet Pieterszoon, and I, When we heard a moaning as we came near, Which made us quake at first for fear. But the moaning was presently heard again, And we knew it was nothing ghostly then; ‘Lord help us, Father!’ Piet Pieterszoon said, ‘Roprecht, for certain, is not dead!’ So under the gallows our cart we drive, And, sure enough, the man was alive; Because of the irons that he was in, He was hanging, not by the neck, but the chin. The reason why things had got thus wrong, Was, that the rope had been left too long; The Hangman's fault—a clumsy rogue, He is not fit to hang a dog. Now Roprecht, as long as the people were there, Never stirr'd hand or foot in the air; But when at last he was left alone, By that time so much of his strength was gone, That he could do little more than groan. Piet and I had been sitting it out, Till a latish hour, at a christening bout; And perhaps we were rash, as you may think, And a little soft or so, for drink. Father Kijf, we could not bear To leave him hanging in misery there; And 'twas an act of mercy, I cannot but say, To get him down, and take him away. And, as you know, all people said What a goodly end that day he had made; So we thought for certain, Father Kijf, That if he were saved he would mend his life. My son, Piet Pieterszoon, and I, We took him down, seeing none was nigh; And we took off his suit of irons with care, When we got him home, and we hid him there. The secret, as you may guess, was known To Alit, my wife, but to her alone; And never sick man, I dare aver, Was better tended than he was by her. Good advice, moreover, as good could be, He had from Alit my wife, and me; And no one could promise fairer than he: So that we and Piet Pieterszoon our son, Thought that we a very good deed had done. You may well think we laughed in our sleeve, At what the people then seem'd to believe; Queer enough it was to hear them say, That the Three Kings took Roprecht away. Or that St. Ursula, who is in bliss, With her Army of Virgins had done this: The Three Kings and St. Ursula, too, I warrant, had something better to do. Piet Pieterszoon my son, and I, We heard them talk as we stood by, And Piet look'd at me with a comical eye. We thought them fools, but, as you shall see, Not over-wise ourselves were we. For I must tell you, Father Kijf, That when we told this to Alit my wife, She at the notion perk'd up with delight, And said she believed the people were right. Had not Roprecht put in the Saints his hope, And who but they should have loosen'd the rope, When they saw that no one could intend To make at the gallows a better end? Yes, she said, it was perfectly clear That there must have been a miracle here; And we had the happiness to be in it, Having been brought there just at the minute. And therefore it would become us to make An offering for this favour's sake To the Three Kings and the Virgins too, Since we could not tell to which it was due. For greater honour there could be none Than what in this business the Saints had done To us and Piet Pieterszoon our son; She talk'd me over, Father Kijf, With that tongue of hers, did Alit my wife. Lord, forgive us! as if the Saints would deign To come and help such a rogue in grain; When the only mercy the case could admit Would have been to make his halter fit! That would have made one hanging do, In happy season for him too, When he was in a proper cue; And have saved some work, as you will see, To my son Piet Pieterszoon, and me. Well, father, we kept him at bed and board, Till his neck was cured and his strength restored; And we should have sent him off this day With something to help him on his way. But this wicked Roprecht, what did he? Though he had been saved thus mercifully; Hanging had done him so little good, That he took to his old ways as soon as he could. Last night, when we were all asleep, Out of his bed did this gallows-bird creep, Piet Pieterszoon's boots and spurs he put on, And stole my best horse, and away he was gone! Now Alit, my wife, did not sleep so hard, But she heard the horse's feet in the yard; And when she jogg'd me, and bade me awake, My mind misgave me as soon as she spake. To the window my good woman went, And watch'd which way his course he bent; And in such time as a pipe can be lit, Our horses were ready with bridle and bit. Away, as fast as we could hie, We went, Piet Pieterszoon and I; And still on the plain we had him in sight; The moon did not shine for nothing that night. Knowing the ground, and riding fast, We came up with him at last, And—would you believe it? Father Kijf, The ungrateful wretch would have taken my life, If he had not miss'd his stroke with a knife! The struggle in no long time was done, Because, you know, we were two to one; But yet all our strength we were fain to try, Piet Pieterszoon my son, and I. When we had got him on the ground, We fastened his hands, and his legs we bound; And across the horse we laid him then, And brought him back to the house again. “We have robb'd the gallows, and that was ill done!” Said I, to Piet Pieterszoon my son; “And restitution we must make To that same gallows, for justice' sake.” In his suit of irons the rogue we array'd, And once again in the cart he was laid! Night not yet so far was spent, But there was time enough for our intent; And back to the triple tree we went. His own rope was ready there; To measure the length we took good care; And the job which the bungling Hangman begun, This time, I think, was properly done, By me and Piet Pieterszoon my son.” THE YOUNG DRAGON. PART I. Pithyrian was a Pagan, An easy-hearted man, And Pagan sure he thought to end As Pagan he began; Thought he, the one must needs be true, The old Religion, or the new, And therefore nothing care I; I call Diana the Divine; My daughter worships at the shrine Of the Christian Goddess, Mary. In this uncertain matter If I the wrong course take, Mary to me will mercy show For my Marana's sake. If I am right, and Dian bend Her dreadful bow, or Phœbus send His shafts abroad for slaughter, Safe from their arrows shall I be And the twin Deities for me Will spare my dear-loved daughter. If every one in Antioch Had reasoned in this strain, It never would have raised alarm In Satan's dark domain. But Mary's Image every day Looks down on crowds who come to pray; Her votaries never falter: While Dian's temple is so bare, That unless her Priestess take good care, She will have a grass-green altar. Perceiving this, the old Dragon Inflamed with anger grew; Earthquakes and Plagues were common ills, There needed something new; Some vengeance so severe and strange That forepast times in all their range With no portent could match it: So for himself a nest he made, And in that nest an egg he laid, And down he sate to hatch it. He built it by the fountain Of Phlegethon's red flood, In the innermost abyss, the place Of central solitude; Of adamantine blocks unhewn, With lava scoria interstrewn, The sole material fitting; With amianth he lined the nest, And incombustible asbest, To bear the fiery sitting. There with malignant patience He sate in fell despite, Till this dracontine cockatrice Should break its way to light. Meantime his angry heart to cheer, He thought that all this while no fear The Antiocheans stood in, Of what on deadliest vengeance bent With imperturbable intent He there for them was brooding. The months of incubation At length were duly past, And now the infernal Dragon-chick Hath burst its shell at last; At which long-look'd-for sight enrapt, For joy the father Dragon clapt His brazen wings like thunder, So loudly that the mighty sound Was like an earthquake felt around And all above and under. The diabolic youngling Came out no callow birth, Puling, defenceless, blind and weak, Like bird or beast of earth; Or man, most helpless thing of all That fly, or swim, or creep, or crawl; But in his perfect figure; His horns, his dreadful tail, his sting, Scales, teeth, and claws and every thing Complete and in their vigour. The Old Dragon was delighted, And proud withal to see In what perfection he had hatch'd His hellish progeny; And round and round, with fold on fold, His tail about the imp he roll'd In fond and close enlacement; And neck round neck with many a turn He coil'd, which was, you may discern, Their manner of embracement. PART II. A voice was heard in Antioch, Whence uttered none could know, But from their sleep it wakened all, Proclaiming woe, woe, woe! It sounded here, it sounded there, Within, without, and every where, A terror, and a warning; Repeated thrice the dreadful word By every living soul was heard Before the hour of morning. And in the air a rushing Past over, in the night; And as it past, there past with it A meteoric light; The blind that piercing light intense Felt in their long seal'd visual sense, With sudden short sensation: The deaf that rushing in the sky Could hear, and that portentous cry Reach'd them with consternation. The astonished Antiocheans Impatiently await The break of day, not knowing when Or what might be their fate. Alas! what then the people hear, Only with certitude of fear Their sinking hearts affrighted; For in the fertile vale below, Came news that, in that night of woe, A Dragon had alighted. It was no earthly monster In Libyan deserts nurst; Nor had the Lerna lake sent forth This winged worm accurst; The Old Dragon's own laid egg was this, The fierce Young Dragon of the abyss, Who from the fiery fountain, Through earth's concavities that night Had made his way, and taken flight Out of a burning mountain. A voice that went before him The cry of woe preferred; The motion of his brazen wings Was what the deaf had heard; The flashing of his eyes, that light The which upon their inward sight The blind had felt astounded; What wonder then, when from the wall They saw him in the vale, if all With terror were confounded. Compared to that strong armour Of scales which he was in, The hide of a rhinoceros Was like a lady's skin. A battering ram might play in vain Upon his head, with might and main, Though fifty men had work'd it; And from his tail they saw him fling Out, like a rocket, a long sting, When he for pastime jerk'd it. To whom of Gods or Heroes Should they for aid apply? Where should they look for succour now, Or whither should they fly? For now no Demigods were found Like those whose deathless deeds abound In ancient song and story; No Hercules was then on earth, Nor yet of her St. George's birth Could Cappadocia glory. And even these against him Had found their strength but small; He could have swallowed Hercules, Club, lion-skin, and all. Yea had St. George himself been there Upon the fiercest steed that e'er To battle bore bestrider, This dreadful Dragon in his might, One mouthful only, and one bite, Had made of horse and rider. They see how unavailing All human force must prove; Oh might their earnest prayers obtain Protection from above! The Christians sought our Lady's shrine To invocate her aid divine; And, with a like emotion, The Pagans on that fearful day Took to Diana's fane their way, And offered their devotion. But there the offended Goddess Beheld them with a frown; The indignant altar heaved itself And shook their offerings down; The Priestess with a deathlike hue Pale as the marble Image grew, The marble Image redden'd; And these poor suppliants at the sight Felt in fresh access of affright Their hearts within them deaden'd. Behold the marble eyeballs With life and motion shine! And from the moving marble lips There comes a voice divine. A demon voice, by all the crowd Distinctly heard, nor low, nor loud, But deep and clear and thrilling; And carrying to the soul such dread That they perforce must what it said Obey, however unwilling. Hear! hear! it said, ye people! The ancient Gods have sent In anger for your long neglect This signal punishment. To mortal Mary vows were paid, And prayers preferr'd, and offerings made; Our temples were deserted; Now when our vengeance makes ye wise Unto your proper Deities In fear ye have reverted! Hear now the dreadful judgement For this which ye have done, The infernal Dragon will devour Your daughters, one by one; A Christian Virgin every day Ye must present him for his prey, With garlands deck'd, as meet is: That with the Christians he begins Is what, in mercy to your sins, Ye owe to my entreaties. Whether, if to my worship Ye now continue true, I may, when these are all consumed, Avert the ill from you: That on the Ancient Gods depends, If they be made once more your friends By your sincere repentance: But for the present, no delay; Cast lots among ye, and obey The inexorable sentence. PART III. Though to the Pagan priesthood A triumph this might seem, Few families there were who thus Could in their grief misdeem; For oft in those distracted days, Parent and child went different ways, The sister and the brother; And when in spirit moved, the wife Chose one religious course of life, The husband took the other. Therefore in every household Was seen the face of fear; They who were safe themselves, exposed In those whom they held dear. The lists are made, and in the urn The names are placed to wait their turn For this far worse than slaughter; And from that fatal urn, the first Drawn for this dreadful death accurst Was of Pithyrian's daughter. With Christian-like composure Marana heard her lot, And though her countenance at first Grew pale, she trembled not. Not for herself the Virgin grieved; She knew in whom she had believed, Knew that a crown of glory In Heaven would recompense her worth, And her good name remain on earth The theme of sacred story. Her fears were for her father, How he should bear this grief, Poor wretched heathen, if he still Remain'd in misbelief; Her looks amid the multitude, Who struck with deep compassion stood, Are seeking for Pithyrian: He cannot bear to meet her eye. Where goest thou? whither wouldst thou fly, Thou miserable Syrian? Hath sudden hope inspired him, Or is it in despair That through the throng he made his way And sped he knew not where? For how could he the sight sustain When now the sacrificial train Inhumanly surround her! How bear to see her when with flowers From rosiers and from jasmine bowers They like a victim crown'd her! He knew not why nor whither So fast he hurried thence, But felt like one possess'd by some Controlling influence, Nor turn'd he to Diana's fane, Inly assured that prayers were vain If made for such protection; His pagan faith he now forgot, And the wild way he took was not His own, but Heaven's direction. He who had never enter'd A Christian chunch till then, Except in idle mood profane To view the ways of men, Now to a Christian church made straight, And hastened through its open gate, By his good Angel guided, And thinking, though he knew not why, That there some blessed Power on high Had help for him provided. Wildly he look'd about him On many a form divine, Whose Image o'er its altar stood, And many a sculptured shrine, In which believers might behold Relics more precious than the gold And jewels which encased them. With painful search from far and near Brought to be venerated here Where piety had placed them. There stood the Virgin Mother Crown'd with a starry wreath, And there the aweful Crucifix, Appeared to bleed and breathe; Martyrs to whom their palm is given, And sainted Maids who now in Heaven With glory are invested; Glancing o'er these his rapid eye Toward one image that stood nigh Was drawn, and there it rested. The countenance that fix'd him Was of a sun-burnt mien, The face was like a Prophet's face Inspired, but yet serene; His arms and legs and feet were bare; The raiment was of camel's hair, That, loosely hanging round him, Fell from the shoulders to the knee; And round the loins, though elsewhere free, A leathern girdle bound him. With his right arm uplifted The great Precursor stood, Thus represented to the life In carved and painted wood. Below the real arm was laid Within a crystal shrine display'd For public veneration; Not now of flesh and blood, . . but bone, Sinews, and shrivell'd skin alone, In ghastly preservation. Moved by a secret impulse Which he could not withstand, Let me, Pithyrian cried, adore That blessed arm and hand! This day, this miserable day, My pagan faith I put away, Abjure it and abhor it; And in the Saints I put my trust, And in the Cross; and, if I must, Will die a Martyr for it. This is the arm whose succour Heaven brings me here to seek! Oh let me press it to my lips, And so its aid bespeak! A strong faith makes me now presume That when to this unhappy doom A hellish power hath brought her, The heavenly hand whose mortal mold I humbly worship, will unfold Its strength, and save my daughter. The Sacristan with wonder And pity heard his prayer, And placed the relic in his hand As he knelt humbly there. Right thankfully the kneeling man To that confiding Sacristan Return'd it, after kissing; And he within its crystal shrine Replaced the precious arm divine, Nor saw that aught was missing. PART IV. Oh piety audacious! Oh boldness of belief! Oh sacrilegious force of faith, That then inspired the thief! Oh wonderful extent of love, That Saints enthroned in bliss above Should bear such profanation, And not by some immediate act, Striking the offender in the fact, Prevent the perpetration! But sure the Saint that impulse Himself from Heaven had sent, In mercy predetermining The marvellous event; So inconceivable a thought, Seeming with such irreverence fraught Could else have no beginning; Nor else might such a deed be done, As then Pithyrian ventured on, Yet had no fear of sinning. Not as that Church he enter'd Did he from it depart, Like one bewildered by his grief, But confident at heart; Triumphantly he went his way And bore the Holy Thumb away, Elated with his plunder; That Holy Thumb which well he knew Could pierce the Dragon through and through, Like Jupiter's own thunder. Meantime was meek Marana For sacrifice array'd, And now in sad procession forth They led the flower-crown'd Maid. Of this infernal triumph vain, The Pagan Priests precede the train, Oh hearts devoid of pity! And to behold the abhorr'd event, At far or nearer distance went The whole of that great city. The Christians go to succour The sufferer with their prayers, The Pagans to a spectacle Which dreadfully declares, In this their over-ruling hour, Their Gods' abominable power; Yet not without emotion Of grief, and horror, and remorse, And natural piety, whose force Prevail'd o'er false devotion. The walls and towers are cluster'd, And every hill and height That overlooks the vale, is throng'd For this accursed sight. Why art thou joyful, thou green Earth? Wherefore, ye happy Birds, your mirth Are ye in carols voicing? And thou, O Sun, in yon blue sky How canst thou hold thy course on high This day, as if rejoicing? Already the procession Hath past the city gate, And now along the vale it moves With solemn pace sedate. And now the spot before them lies Where waiting for his promised prize The Dragon's chosen haunt is; Blacken'd beneath his blasting feet, Though yesterday a green retreat Beside the clear Orontes. There the procession halted; The Priests on either hand Dividing then, a long array, In order took their stand. Midway between, the Maid is left, Alone, of human aid bereft: The Dragon now hath spied her; But in that moment of most need, Arriving breathless with his speed, Her Father stood beside her. On came the Dragon rampant, Half running, half on wing, His tail uplifted o'er his back In many a spiral ring; His scales he ruffled in his pride, His brazen pennons waving wide Were gloriously distended; His nostrils smoked, his eyes flash'd fire, His lips were drawn, and in his ire His mighty jaws extended. On came the Dragon rampant, Expecting there no check, And open-mouth'd to swallow both He stretch'd his burnish'd neck. Pithyrian put his daughter by, Waiting for this with watchful eye And ready to prevent it; Within arm's length he let him come, Then in he threw the Holy Thumb, And down his throat he sent it. The hugest brazen mortar That ever yet fired bomb, Could not have check'd this fiendish beast As did that Holy Thumb. He stagger'd as he wheel'd short round, His loose feet scraped along the ground, To lift themselves unable: His pennons in their weakness flagg'd, His tail erected late, now dragg'd, Just like a long wet cable. A rumbling and a tumbling Was heard in his inside, He gasp'd, he panted, he lay down, He rolled from side to side: He moan'd, he groan'd, he snuff'd, he snored, He growl'd, he howl'd, he raved, he roar'd; But loud as were his clamours, Far louder was the inward din, Like a hundred braziers working in A caldron with their hammers. The hammering came faster, More faint the moaning sound, And now his body swells, and now It rises from the ground. Not upward with his own consent, Nor borne by his own wings he went, Their vigour was abated; But lifted no one could tell how By power unseen, with which he now Was visibly inflated. Abominable Dragon, Now art thou overmatch'd, And better had it been for thee That thou hadst ne'er been hatch'd; For now, distended like a ball To its full stretch, in sight of all, The body mounts ascendant; The head before, the tail behind, The wings, like sails that want a wind, On either side are pendant. Not without special mercy Was he thus borne on high, Till he appear'd no bigger than An Eagle in the sky. For when about some three miles height, Yet still in perfect reach of sight, Oh, wonder of all wonders! He burst in pieces, with a sound Heard for a hundred leagues around, And like a thousand thunders. But had that great explosion Been in the lower sky, All Antioch would have been laid In ruins, certainly. And in that vast assembled rout Who crowded joyfully about Pithyrian and his daughter, The splinters of the monster's hide Must needs have made on every side A very dreadful slaughter. So far the broken pieces Were now dispersed around, And shiver'd so to dust, that not A fragment e'er was found. The Holy Thumb (so it is thought) When it this miracle had wrought At once to Heaven ascended: As if, when it had thus display'd Its power, and saved the Christian Maid, Its work on earth was ended. But at Constantinople The arm and hand were shown, Until the mighty Ottoman O'erthrew the Grecian throne. And when the Monks this tale who told To pious visitors would hold The holy hand for kissing, They never fail'd with faith devout In confirmation to point out That there the Thumb was missing. Keswick, 1829. EPILOGUE TO THE YOUNG DRAGON. I told my tale of the Holy Thumb That split the Dragon asunder, And my daughters made great eyes as they heard, Which were full of delight and wonder. With listening lips and looks intent, There sate an eager boy, Who shouted sometimes and clapt his hands, And could not sit still for joy. But when I look'd at my Mistress's face, It was all too grave the while; And when I ceased, methought there was more Of reproof than of praise in her smile. That smile I read aright, for thus Reprovingly said she, “Such tales are meet for youthful ears, But give little content to me. “From thee far rather would I hear Some sober, sadder lay, Such as I oft have heard, well pleased Before those locks were grey.” “Nay, Mistress mine,” I made reply, “The autumn hath its flowers, Nor ever is the sky more gay Than in its evening hours. “Our good old Cat, Earl Tomlemagne, Upon a warm spring day, Even like a kitten at its sport, Is sometimes seen to play. “That sense which held me back in youth From all intemperate gladness, That same good instinct bids me shun Unprofitable sadness. “Nor marvel you if I prefer Of playful themes to sing, The October grove hath brighter tints Than Summer or than Spring: “For o'er the leaves before they fall Such hues hath Nature thrown, That the woods wear in sunless days A sunshine of their own. “Why should I seek to call forth tears? The source from whence we weep Too near the surface lies in youth, In age it lies too deep. “Enough of foresight sad, too much Of retrospect have I; And well for me that I sometimes Can put those feelings by; “From public ills, and thoughts that else Might weigh me down to earth, That I can gain some intervals For healthful, hopeful mirth; “That I can sport in tales which suit Young auditors like these, Yet, if I err not, may content The few I seek to please. “I know in what responsive minds My lightest lay will wake A sense of pleasure, for its own, And for its author's sake. “I know the eyes in which the light Of memory will appear; I know the lips which while they read Will wear a smile sincere: “The hearts to which my sportive song The thought of days will bring, When they and I, whose Winter now Comes on, were in our Spring. “And I their well known voices too, Though far away, can hear, Distinctly, even as when in dreams They reach the inward ear. “‘There speaks the man we knew of yore,’ Well pleased I hear them say, ‘Such was he in his lighter moods Before our heads were grey. “‘Buoyant he was in spirit, quick Of fancy, blithe of heart, And Care and Time and Change have left Untouch'd his better part.’ “Thus say my morning friends who now Are in the vale of years, And I, save such as thus may rise, Would draw no other tears.” Keswick, 1829.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. VII. TO EDITH MAY SOUTHEY. 1. Edith! ten years are number'd, since the day, Which ushers in the cheerful month of May, To us by thy dear birth, my daughter dear, Was blest. Thou therefore didst the name partake Of that sweet month, the sweetest of the year; But fitlier was it given thee for the sake Of a good man, thy father's friend sincere, Who at the font made answer in thy name. Thy love and reverence rightly may he claim, For closely hath he been with me allied In friendship's holy bonds, from that first hour When in our youth we met on Tejo's side; Bonds which, defying now all Fortune's power, Time hath not loosen'd, nor will Death divide. 2. A child more welcome, by indulgent Heaven Never to parents' tears and prayers was given: For scarcely eight months at thy happy birth Had pass'd, since of thy sister we were left, . . . Our first-born and our only babe, bereft. Too fair a flower was she for this rude earth! The features of her beauteous infancy Have faded from me, like a passing cloud, Or like the glories of an evening sky: And seldom hath my tongue pronounced her name Since she was summon'd to a happier sphere. But that dear love so deeply wounded then, I in my soul with silent faith sincere Devoutly cherish till we meet again. 3. I saw thee first with trembling thankfulness, O daughter of my hopes and of my fears! Press'd on thy senseless cheek a troubled kiss, And breathed my blessing over thee with tears. But memory did not long our bliss alloy; For gentle nature who had given relief Wean'd with new love the chasten'd heart from grief; And the sweet season minister'd to joy. 4. It was a season when their leaves and flowers The trees as to an Arctic summer spread; When chilling wintry winds and snowy showers, Which had too long usurp'd the vernal hours, Like spectres from the sight of morning, fled Before the presence of that joyous May; And groves and gardens all the live-long day Rung with the birds' loud love-songs. Over all, One thrush was heard from morn till even-fall; Thy Mother well remembers when she lay The happy prisoner of the genial bed, How from yon lofty poplar's topmost spray At earliest dawn his thrilling pipe was heard; And when the light of evening died away, That blithe and indefatigable bird Still his redundant song of joy and love preferr'd. 5. How I have doted on thine infant smiles At morning when thine eyes unclosed on mine; How, as the months in swift succession roll'd, I mark'd thy human faculties unfold, And watch'd the dawning of the light divine; And with what artifice of playful guiles Won from thy lips with still-repeated wiles Kiss after kiss, a reckoning often told, . . . Something I ween thou know'st; for thou hast seen Thy sisters in their turn such fondness prove, And felt how childhood in its winning years The attemper'd soul to tenderness can move. This thou canst tell; but not the hopes and fears With which a parent's heart doth overflow, . . . The thoughts and cares inwoven with that love, . . . Its nature and its depth, thou dostnot, canst not know. 6. The years which since thy birth have pass'd away May well to thy young retrospect appear A measureless extent: . . . like yesterday To me, so soon thy fill'd their short career. To thee discourse of reason have they brought, With sense of time and change; and something too Of this precarious state of things have taught, Where Man abideth never in one stay; And of mortality a mournful thought. And I have seen thine eyes suffused in grief, When I have said that with autumnal grey The touch of eld hath mark'd thy father's head; That even the longest day of life is brief, And mine is falling fast into the yellow leaf. 7. Thy happy nature from the painful thought With instinct turns, and scarcely canst thou bear To hear me name the Grave: Thou knowest not How large a portion of my heart is there! The faces which I loved in infancy Are gone; and bosom-friends of riper age, With whom I fondly talk'd of years to come, Summon'd before me to their heritage Are in the better world, beyond the tomb. And I have brethren there, and sisters dear, And dearer babes. I therefore needs must dwell Often in thought with those whom still I love so well. 8. Thus wilt thou feel in thy maturer mind; When grief shall be thy portion, thou wilt find Safe consolation in such thoughts as these, . . . A present refuge in affliction's hour. And if indulgent Heaven thy lot should bless With all imaginable happiness, Here shalt thou have, my child, beyond all power Of chance, thy holiest, surest, best delight. Take therefore now thy Father's latest lay, . . . Perhaps his last; . . . and treasure in thine heart The feelings that its musing strains convey. A song it is of life's declining day, Yet meet for youth. Vain passions to excite, No strains of morbid sentiment I sing, Nor tell of idle loves with ill-spent breath; A reverent offering to the Grave I bring, And twine a garland for the brow of Death. Keswick, 1814. PROEM. That was a memorable day for Spain, When on Pamplona's towers, so basely won, The Frenchmen stood, and saw upon the plain Their long-expected succours hastening on: Exultingly they mark'd the brave array, And deem'd their leader should his purpose gain, Though Wellington and England barr'd the way. Anon the bayonets glitter'd in the sun, And frequent cannon flash'd, whose lurid light Redden'd thro' sulphurous smoke; fast volleying round Roll'd the war-thunders, and with long rebound Backward from many a rock and cloud-capt height In answering peals Pyrene sent the sound. Impatient for relief, toward the fight The hungry garrison their eye-balls strain: Vain was the Frenchman's skill, his valour vain; And even then, when eager hope almost Had moved their irreligious lips to prayer, Averting from the fatal scene their sight, They breathed the execrations of despair. For Wellesley's star hath risen ascendant there; Once more he drove the host of France to flight, And triumph'd once again for God and for the right. That was a day, whose influence far and wide The struggling nations felt; it was a joy Wherewith all Europe rung from side to side. Yet hath Pamplona seen in former time A moment big with mightier consequence, Affecting many an age and distant clime. That day it was which saw in her defence, Contending with the French before her wall, A noble soldier of Guipuzcoa fall, Sore hurt, but not to death. For when long care Restored his shatter'd leg and set him free, He would not brook a slight deformity, As one who being gay and debonnair, In courts conspicuous as in camps must be: So he forsooth a shapely boot must wear; And the vain man, with peril of his life, Laid the recover'd limb again beneath the knife. Long time upon the bed of pain he lay Whiling with books the weary hours away; And from that circumstance and this vain man A train of long events their course began, Whose term it is not given us yet to see. Who hath not heard Loyola's sainted name, Before whom Kings and Nations bow'd the knee? Thy annals, Ethiopia, might proclaim What deeds arose from that prolific day; And of dark plots might shuddering Europe tell. But Science too her trophies would display; Faith give the martyrs of Japan their fame. And Charity on works of love would dwell In California's dolorous regions drear; And where, amid a pathless world of wood, Gathering a thousand rivers on his way, Huge Orellana rolls his affluent flood; And where the happier sons of Paraguay, By gentleness and pious art subdued, Bow'd their meek heads beneath the Jesuits' sway, And lived and died in filial servitude. I love thus uncontroll'd, as in a dream, To muse upon the course of human things; Exploring sometimes the remotest springs, Far as tradition lends one guiding gleam; Or following, upon Thought's audacious wings, Into Futurity, the endless stream. But now in quest of no ambitious height, I go where Truth and Nature lead my way, And ceasing here from desultory flight, In measured strains I tell a Tale of Paraguay. A TALE OF PARAGUAY. CANTO I. 1 Jenner! for ever shall thy honour'd name Among the children of mankind be blest, Who by thy skill hast taught us how to tame One dire disease, . . the lamentable pest Which Africa sent forth to scourge the West, As if in vengeance for her sable brood So many an age remorselessly opprest. For that most fearful malady subdued Receive a poet's praise, a father's gratitude. 2 Fair promise be this triumph of an age When Man, with vain desires no longer blind, And wise though late, his only war shall wage Against the miseries which afflict mankind, Striving with virtuous heart and strenuous mind Till evil from the earth shall pass away. Lo, this his glorious destiny assign'd! For that blest consummation let us pray, And trust in fervent faith, and labour as we may. 3 The hideous malady which lost its power When Jenner's art the dire contagion stay'd, Among Columbia's sons, in fatal hour Across the wide Atlantic wave convey'd, Its fiercest form of pestilence display'd: Where'er its deadly course the plague began Vainly the wretched sufferer look'd for aid; Parent from child, and child from parent ran, For tyrannous fear dissolved all natural bonds of man. 4 A feeble nation of Guarani race, Thinn'd by perpetual wars, but unsubdued, Had taken up at length a resting place Among those tracts of lake and swamp and wood, Where Mondai issuing from its solitude Flows with slow stream to Empalado's bed. It was a region desolate and rude; But thither had the horde for safety fled, And being there conceal'd in peace their lives they led. 5 There had the tribe a safe asylum found Amid those marshes wide and woodlands dense, With pathless wilds and waters spread around, And labyrinthine swamps, a sure defence From human foes, . . . but not from pestilence. The spotted plague appear'd, that direst ill, . . . How brought among them none could tell, or whence; The mortal seed had lain among them still, And quicken'd now to work the Lord's my sterious will. 6 Alas, it was no medicable grief Which herbs might reach! Nor could the juggler's power With all his antic mummeries bring relief. Faith might not aid him in that ruling hour, Himself a victim now. The dreadful stour None could escape, nor aught its force assuage. The marriageable maiden had her dower From death; the strong man sunk beneath its rage, And death cut short the thread of childhood and of age. 7 No time for customary mourning now; With hand close-clench'd to pluck the rooted hair, To beat the bosom, on the swelling brow Inflict redoubled blows, and blindly tear The cheeks, indenting bloody furrows there, The deep-traced signs indelible of woe; Then to some crag, or bank abrupt, repair, And giving grief its scope, infuriate throw The impatient body thence upon the earth below. 8 Devices these by poor weak nature taught, Which thus a change of suffering would obtain; And flying from intolerable thought And piercing recollections, would full fain Distract itself by sense of fleshly pain From anguish that the soul must else endure. Easier all outward torments to sustain, Than those heart-wounds which only time can cure, And He in whom alone the hopes of man are sure. 9 None sorrow'd here; the sense of woe was sear'd, When every one endured his own sore ill. The prostrate sufferers neither hoped nor fear'd; The body labour'd, but the heart was still: . . . So let the conquering malady fulfil Its fatal course, rest cometh at the end! Passive they lay with neither wish nor will For aught but this; nor did they long attend Thatwelcome boon from death, the never-failing friend. 10 Who is there to make ready now the pit, The house that will content from this day forth Its easy tenant? Who in vestments fit Shall swathe the sleeper for his bed of earth, Now tractable as when a babe at birth? Who now the ample funeral urn shall knead, And burying it beneath his proper hearth Deposit there with careful hands the dead, And lightly then relay the floor above his head? 11 Unwept, unshrouded, and unsepulchred, The hammock where they hang, for winding sheet And grave suffices the deserted dead: There from the armadillo's searching feet Safer than if within the tomb's retreat. The carrion birds obscene in vain essay To find that quarry: round and round they beat The air, but fear to enter for their prey, And from the silent door the jaguar turns away. 12 But nature for her universal law Hath other surer instruments in store, Whom from the haunts of men no wonted awe Withholds as with a spell. In swarms they pour From wood and swamp: and when their work is o'er, On the white bones the mouldering roof will fall; Seeds will take root, and spring in sun and shower; And Mother Earth ere long with her green pall, Resuming to herself the wreck, will cover all. 13 Oh! better thus with earth to have their part, Than in Egyptian catacombs to lie, Age after age preserved by horrid art, In ghastly image of humanity! Strange pride that with corruption thus would vie! And strange delusion that would thus maintain The fleshly form, till cycles shall pass by, And in the series of the eternal chain, The spirit come to seek its old abode again. 14 One pair alone survived the general fate; Left in such drear and mournful solitude, That death might seem a preferable state. Not more deprest the Arkite patriarch stood, When landing first on Ararat he view'd, Where all around the mountain summits lay, Like islands seen amid the boundless flood: Nor our first parents more forlorn than they, Thro' Eden when they took their solitary way. 15 Alike to them, it seem'd in their despair, Whither they wander'd from the infected spot. Chance might direct their steps: they took no care; Come well or ill to them, it matter'd not! Left as they were in that unhappy lot, The sole survivors they of all their race, They reck'd not when their fate, nor where, nor what, In this resignment to their hopeless case, Indifferent to all choice or circumstance of place. 16 That palsying stupor past away ere long, And as the spring of health resumed its power, They felt that life was dear, and hope was strong. What marvel? 'Twas with them the morning hour, When bliss appears to be the natural dower Of all the creatures of this joyous earth; And sorrow fleeting like a vernal shower Scarce interrupts the current of our mirth; Such is the happy heart we bring with us at birth. 17 Though of his nature and his boundless love Erring, yet tutor'd by instinctive sense, They rightly deem'd the Power who rules above Had saved them from the wasting pestilence. That favouring power would still be their defence: Thus were they by their late deliverance taught To place a child-like trust in Providence, And in their state forlorn they found this thought Of natural faith with hope and consolation fraught. 18 And now they built themselves a leafy bower, Amid a glade, slow Mondai's stream beside, Screen'd from the southern blast of piercing power: Not like their native dwelling, long and wide, By skilful toil of numbers edified, The common home of all, their human nest, Where threescore hammocks pendant side by side Were ranged, and on the ground the fires were drest; Alas, that populous hive hath now no living guest! 19 A few firm stakes they planted in the ground, Circling a narrow space, yet large enow; These strongly interknit they closed around With basket-work of many a pliant bough. The roof was like the sides; the door was low, And rude the hut, and trimm'd with little care, For little heart had they to dress it now; Yet was the humble structure fresh and fair, And soon its inmates found that love might sojourn there. 20 Quiara could recall to mind the course Of twenty summers; perfectly he knew Whate'er his fathers taught of skill or force. Right to the mark his whizzing lance he threw, And from his bow the unerring arrow flew With fatal aim: and when the laden bee Buzz'd by him in its flight, he could pursue Its path with certain ken, and follow free Until he traced the hive in hidden bank or tree. 21 Of answering years was Monnema, nor less Expert in all her sex's household ways. The Indian weed she skilfully could dress; And in what depth to drop the yellow maize She knew, and when around its stem to raise The lighten'd soil; and well could she prepare Its ripen'd seed for food, her proper praise; Or in the embers turn with frequent care Its succulent head yet green, sometimes for daintier fare. 22 And how to macerate the bark she knew, And draw apart its beaten fibres fine, And bleaching them in sun, and air, and dew; From dry and glossy filaments entwine With rapid twirl of hand the lengthening line; Next interknitting well the twisted thread, In many an even mesh its knots combine, And shape in tapering length the pensile bed, Light hammock there to hang beneath the leafy shed. 23 Time had been when expert in works of clay She lent her hands the swelling urn to mould, And fill'd it for the appointed festal day With the beloved beverage which the bold Quaff'd in their triumph and their joy of old; The fruitful cause of many an uproar rude, When in their drunken bravery uncontroll'd, Some bitter jest awoke the dormant feud, And wrath and rage and strife and wounds and death ensued. 24 These occupations were gone by: the skill Was useless now, which once had been her pride. Content were they, when thirst impell'd, to fill The dry and hollow gourd from Mondai's side; The river from its sluggish bed supplied A draught for repetition all unmeet; Howbeit the bodily want was satisfied; No feverish pulse ensued, nor ireful heat, Their days were undisturb'd, their natural sleep was sweet. 25 She too had learnt in youth how best to trim The honour'd Chief for his triumphal day, And covering with soft gums the obedient limb And body, then with feathers overlay, In regular hues disposed, a rich display. Well-pleased the glorious savage stood and eyed The growing work; then vain of his array Look'd with complacent frown from side to side, Stalk'd with elater step, and swell'd with statelier pride. 26 Feasts and carousals, vanity and strife, Could have no place with them in solitude To break the tenor of their even life. Quiara day by day his game pursued, Searching the air, the water, and the wood, With hawk-like eye, and arrow sure as fate; And Monnema prepared the hunter's food: Cast with him here in this forlorn estate, In all things for the man was she a fitting mate. 27 The Moon had gather'd oft her monthly store Of light, and oft in darkness left the sky, Since Monnema a growing burthen bore Of life and hope. The appointed weeks go by; And now her hour is come, and none is nigh To help: but human help she needed none. A few short throes endured with scarce a cry, Upon the bank she laid her new-born son, Then slid into the stream, and bathed, and all was done. 28 Might old observances have there been kept, Then should the husband to that pensile bed, Like one exhausted with the birth have crept, And laying down in feeble guise his head, For many a day been nursed and dieted With tender care, to childing mothers due. Certes a custom strange, and yet far spread Through many a savage tribe, howe'er it grew, And once in the old world known as widely as the new. 29 This could not then be done; he might not lay The bow and those unerring shafts aside; Nor through the appointed weeks forego the prey, Still to be sought amid those regions wide, None being there who should the while provide That lonely household with their needful food: So still Quiara through the forest plied His daily task, and in the thickest wood Still laid his snares for birds, and still the chase pursued. 30 But seldom may such thoughts of mingled joy A father's agitated breast dilate, As when he first beheld that infant boy. Who hath not proved it, ill can estimate The feeling of that stirring hour, . . . the weight Of that new sense, the thoughtful, pensive bliss. In all the changes of our changeful state, Even from the cradle to the grave, I wis, The heart doth undergo no change so great as this. 31 A deeper and unwonted feeling fill'd These parents, gazing on their new-born son. Already in their busy hopes they build On this frail sand. Now let the seasons run, And let the natural work of time be done With them, . . . for unto them a child is born: And when the hand of Death may reach the one, The other will not now be left to mourn A solitary wretch, all utterly forlorn. 32 Thus Monnema and thus Quiara thought, Though each the melancholy thought represt; They could not choose but feel, yet utter'd not The human feeling, which in hours of rest Often would rise, and fill the boding breast With a dread foretaste of that mournful day, When, at the inexorable Power's behest, The unwilling spirit, called perforce away, Must leave, for ever leave its dear connatural clay. 33 Link'd as they were, where each to each was all, How might the poor survivor hope to bear That heaviest loss which one day must befall, Nor sink beneath the weight of his despair? Scarce could the heart even for a moment dare That miserable time to contemplate, When the dread Messenger should find them there, From whom is no escape, . . . and reckless Fate, Whom it had bound so close, for ever separate. 34 Lighter that burthen lay upon the heart When this dear babe was born to share their lot; They could endure to think that they must part. Then too a glad consolatory thought Arose, while gazing on the child they sought With hope their dreary prospect to delude, Till they almost believed, as fancy taught, How that from them a tribe should spring renew'd, To people and possess that ample solitude. 35 Such hope they felt, but felt that whatsoe'er The undiscoverable to come might prove, Unwise it were to let that bootless care Disturb the present hours of peace and love. For they had gain'd a happiness above The state which in their native horde was known: No outward causes were there here to move Discord and alien thoughts; being thus alone From all mankind, their hearts and their desires were one. 36 Different their love in kind and in degree From what their poor depraved forefathers knew, With whom degenerate instincts were left free To take their course, and blindly to pursue, Unheeding they the ills that must ensue, The bent of brute desire. No moral tie Bound the hard husband to his servile crew Of wives; and they the chance of change might try, All love destroy'd by such preposterous liberty. 37 Far other tie this solitary pair Indissolubly bound; true helpmates they, In joy or grief, in weal or woe to share, In sickness or in health, thro' life's long day; And reassuming in their hearts her sway Benignant Nature made the burthen light. It was the Woman's pleasure to obey, The Man's to ease her toil in all he might, So each in serving each obtain'd the best delight. 38 And as connubial, so parental love Obey'd unerring Nature's order here, For now no force of impious custom strove Against her law; . . . such as was wont to sear The unhappy heart with usages severe, Till harden'd mothers in the grave could lay Their living babes with no compunctious tear; So monstrous men become, when from the way Of primal light they turn thro' heathen paths astray. 39 Deliver'd from this yoke, in them henceforth The springs of natural love may freely flow: New joys, new virtues with that happy birth Are born, and with the growing infant grow. Source of our purest happiness below Is that benignant law which hath entwined Dearest delight with strongest duty so That in the healthy heart and righteous mind Ever they co-exist, inseparably combined. 40 Oh! bliss for them when in that infant face They now the unfolding faculties descry, And fondly gazing, trace . . . or think they trace The first faint speculation in that eye, Which hitherto hath roll'd in vacancy! Oh! bliss in that soft countenance to seek Some mark of recognition, and espy The quiet smile which in the innocent cheek Of kindness and of kind its consciousness doth speak! 41 For him, if born among their native tribe, Some haughty name his parents had thought good, As weening that therewith they should ascribe The strength of some fierce tenant of the wood, The water, or the aërial solitude, Jaguar or vulture, water-wolf or snake, The beast that prowls abroad in search of blood, Or reptile that within the treacherous brake Waits for the prey, upcoil'd, its hunger to aslake. 42 Now soften'd as their spirits were by love, Abhorrent from such thoughts they turn'd away; And with a happier feeling, from the dove, They named the child Yeruti. On a day When smiling at his mother's breast in play, They in his tones of murmuring pleasure heard A sweet resemblance of the stock-dove's lay, Fondly they named him from that gentle bird, And soon such happy use endear'd the fitting word. 43 Days pass, and moons have wax'd and waned, and still This dovelet nestled in their leafy bower Obtains increase of sense, and strength and will, As in due order many a latent power Expands, . . . humanity's exalted dower: And they while thus the days serenely fled Beheld him flourish like a vigorous flower, Which lifting from a genial soil its head By seasonable suns and kindly showers is fed. 44 Ere long the cares of helpless babyhood To the next stage of infancy give place, That age with sense of conscious growth endued, When every gesture hath its proper grace: Then come the unsteady step, the tottering pace; And watchful hopes and emulous thoughts appear; The imitative lips essay to trace Their words, observant both with eye and ear, In mutilated sounds which parents love to hear. 45 Serenely thus the seasons pass away; And, oh! how rapidly they seem to fly With those for whom to-morrow like to-day Glides on in peaceful uniformity! Five years have since Yeruti's birth gone by, Five happy years; . . and ere the Moon which then Hung like a Sylphid's light canoe on high Should fill its circle, Monnema again Laying her burthen down must bear a mother's pain. 46 Alas, a keener pang before that day, Must by the wretched Monnema be borne! In quest of game Quiara went his way To roam the wilds as he was wont, one morn; She look'd in vain at eve for his return. By moonlight thro' the midnight solitude She sought him; and she found his garment torn, His bow and useless arrows in the wood, Marks of a jaguar's feet, a broken spear, and blood. CANTO II. 1 O thou who listening to the Poet's song Dost yield thy willing spirit to his sway, Look not that I should painfully prolong The sad narration of that fatal day With tragic details: all too true the lay! Nor is my purpose e'er to entertain The heart with useless grief; but as I may, Blend in my calm and meditative strain Consolatory thoughts, the balm for real pain. 2 O Youth or Maiden, whosoe'er thou art, Safe in my guidance may thy spirit be; I wound not wantonly the tender heart: And if sometimes a tear of sympathy Should rise, it will from bitterness be free . . . Yea, with a healing virtue be endued, As thou in this true tale shalt hear from me Of evils overcome, and grief subdued, And virtues springing up like flowers in solitude. 3 The unhappy Monnema when thus bereft Sunk not beneath the desolating blow. Widow'd she was: but still her child was left; For him must she sustain the weight of woe, Which else would in that hour have laid her low. Nor wish'd she now the work of death complete: Then only doth the soul of woman know Its proper strength, when love and duty meet; Invincible the heart wherein they have their seat. 4 The seamen who upon some coral reef Are cast amid the interminable main, Still cling to life, and hoping for relief Drag on their days of wretchedness and pain. In turtle shells they hoard the scanty rain, And eat its flesh, sun-dried for lack of fire, Till the weak body can no more sustain Its wants, but sinks beneath its sufferings dire; Most miserable man who sees the rest expire! 5 He lingers there while months and years go by: And holds his hope though months and years have past; And still at morning round the farthest sky, And still at eve his eagle glance is cast, If there he may behold the far-off mast Arise, for which he hath not ceased to pray. And if perchance a ship should come at last, And bear him from that dismal bank away, He blesses God that he hath lived to see that day. 6 So strong a hold hath life upon the soul, Which sees no dawning of eternal light, But subject to this mortal frame's controul, Forgetful of its origin and right, Content in bondage dwells and utter night. By worthier ties was this poor mother bound To life; even while her grief was at the height, Then in maternal love support she found, And in maternal cares a healing for her wound. 7 For now her hour is come: a girl is born, Poor infant, all unconscious of its fate, How passing strange, how utterly forlorn! The genial season served to mitigate In all it might their sorrowful estate, Supplying to the mother at her door From neighbouring trees which bent beneath their weight, A full supply of fruitage now mature, So in that time of need their sustenance was sure. 8 Nor then alone, but alway did the Eye Of Mercy look upon that lonely bower. Days past, and weeks; and months and years went by, And never evil thing the while had power To enter there. The boy in sun and shower Rejoicing in his strength to youthhed grew; And Mooma, that beloved girl, a dower Of gentleness from bounteous nature drew, With all that should the heart of womankind imbue. 9 The tears which o'er her infancy were shed Profuse, resented not of grief alone: Maternal love their bitterness allay'd, And with a strength and virtue all its own Sustain'd the breaking heart. A look, a tone, A gesture of that innocent babe, in eyes With saddest recollections overflown, Would sometimes make a tender smile arise, Like sunshine opening thro' a shower in vernal skies. 10 No looks but those of tenderness were found To turn upon that helpless infant dear; And as her sense unfolded, never sound Of wrath or discord brake upon her ear. Her soul its native purity sincere Possess'd, by no example here defiled; From envious passions free, exempt from fear, Unknowing of all ill, amid the wild Beloving and beloved she grew, a happy child. 11 Yea, where that solitary bower was placed, Though all unlike to Paradise the scene, (A wide circumference of woodlands waste:) Something of what in Eden might have been Was shadow'd there imperfectly, I ween, In this fair creature: safe from all offence, Expanding like a shelter'd plant serene, Evils that fret and stain being far from thence, Her heart in peace and joy retain'd its innocence. 12 At first the infant to Yeruti proved A cause of wonder and disturbing joy. A stronger tie than that of kindred moved His inmost being, as the happy boy Felt in his heart of hearts without alloy The sense of kind: a fellow creature she, In whom when now she ceased to be a toy For tender sport, his soul rejoiced to see Connatural powers expand, and growing sympathy. 13 For her he cull'd the fairest flowers, and sought Throughout the woods the earliest fruits for her. The cayman's eggs, the honeycomb he brought To this beloved sister, . . . whatsoe'er, To his poor thought, of delicate or rare The wilds might yield, solicitous to find. They who affirm all natural acts declare Self-love to be the ruler of the mind, Judge from their own mean hearts, and foully wrong mankind. 14 Three souls in whom no selfishness had place Were here: three happy souls, which undefiled, Albeit in darkness, still retain'd a trace Of their celestial origin. The wild Was as a sanctuary where Nature smiled Upon these simple children of her own, And cherishing whate'er was meek and mild, Call'd forth the gentle virtues, such alone, The evils which evoke the stronger being unknown. 15 What though at birth we bring with us the seed Of sin, a mortal taint, . . . in heart and will Too surely felt, too plainly shown in deed, . . . Our fatal heritage; yet are we still The children of the All Merciful; and ill They teach, who tell us that from hence must flow God's wrath, and then his justice to fulfil, Death everlasting, never-ending woe: O miserable lot of man if it were so! 16 Falsely and impiously teach they who thus Our heavenly Father's holy will misread! In bounty hath the Lord created us, In love redeem'd. From this authentic creed Let no bewildering sophistry impede The heart's entire assent, for God is good. Hold firm this faith, and, in whatever need, Doubt not but thou wilt find thy soul endued With all-sufficing strength of heavenly fortitude! 17 By nature peccable and frail are we, Easily beguiled; to vice, to error prone; But apt for virtue too. Humanity Is not a field where tares and thorns alone Are left to spring; good seed hath there been sown With no unsparing hand. Sometimes the shoot Is choked with weeds, or withers on a stone; But in a kindly soil it strikes its root, And flourisheth, and bringeth forth abundant fruit. 18 Love, duty, generous feeling, tenderness, Spring in the uncontaminated mind; And these were Mooma's natural dower. Nor less Had liberal Nature to the boy assign'd, Happier herein than if among mankind Their lot had fallen, . . . oh, certes happier here! That all things tended still more close to bind Their earliest ties, and they from year to year Retain'd a childish heart, fond, simple, and sincere. 19 They had no sad reflection to alloy The calm contentment of the passing day, Nor foresight to disturb the present joy. Not so with Monnema; albeit the sway Of time had reach'd her heart, and worn away, At length, the grief so deeply seated there, The future often, like a burthen, lay Upon that heart, a cause of secret care And melancholy thought; yet did she not despair. 20 Chance from the fellowship of human kind Had cut them off, and chance might reunite. On this poor possibility her mind Reposed; she did not for herself invite The unlikely thought, and cherish with delight The dream of what such change might haply bring; Gladness with hope long since had taken flight From her; she felt that life was on the wing, And happiness like youth has here no second spring. 21 So were her feelings to her lot composed That to herself all change had now been pain. For Time upon her own desires had closed; But in her children as she lived again, For their dear sake she learnt to entertain A wish for human intercourse renew'd; And oftentimes, while they devour'd the strain, Would she beguile their evening solitude With stories strangely told and strangely understood. 22 Little she knew, for little had she seen, And little of traditionary lore Had reach'd her ear; and yet to them I ween Their mother's knowledge seem'd a bound less store. A world it opened to their thoughts, yea more, . . . Another world beyond this mortal state. Bereft of her they had indeed been poor, Being left to animal sense, degenerate, Mere creatures, they had sunk below the beasts' estate. 23 The human race, from her they understood, Was not within that lonely hut confined, But distant far beyond their world of wood Were tribes and powerful nations of their kind; And of the old observances which bind People and chiefs, the ties of man and wife, The laws of kin religiously assign'd, Rites, customs, scenes of riotry and strife, And all the strange vicissitudes of savage life. 24 Wondering they listen to the wonderous tale, But no repining thought such tales excite: Only a wish, if wishes might avail, Was haply felt, with juvenile delight, To mingle in the social dance at night, Where the broad moonshine, level as a flood, O'erspread the plain, and in the silver light, Well-pleased, the placid elders sate and view'd The sport, and seem'd therein to feel their youth renew'd. 25 But when the darker scenes their mother drew, What crimes were wrought when drunken fury raged, What miseries from their fatal discord grew When horde with horde in deadly strife engaged: The rancorous hate with which their wars they waged, The more unnatural horrors which ensued, When, with inveterate vengeance unassuaged, The victors round their slaughter'd captives stood, And babes were brought to dip their little hands in blood: 26 Horrent they heard; and with her hands the Maid Prest her eyes close as if she strove to blot The hateful image which her mind portray'd. The Boy sate silently, intent in thought; Then with a deep-drawn sigh, as if he sought To heave the oppressive feeling from his breast, Complacently compared their harmless lot With such wild life, outrageous and unblest, Securely thus to live, he said, was surely best. 27 On tales of blood they could not bear to dwell, From such their hearts abhorrent shrunk in fear. Better they liked that Monnema should tell Of things unseen; what Power had placed them here, And whence the living spirit came, and where It past, when parted from this mortal mold; Of such mysterious themes with willing ear They heard, devoutly listening while she told Strangely-disfigured truths, and fables feign'd of old. 28 By the Great Spirit man was made, she said, His voice it was which peal'd along the sky, And shook the heavens and fill'd the earth with dread. Alone and inaccessible, on high He had his dwelling-place eternally, And Father was his name. This all knew well; But none had seen his face: and if his eye Regarded what upon the earth befell, Or if he cared for man, she knew not: . . . who could tell? 29 But this, she said, was sure, that after death There was reward and there was punishment: And that the evil doers, when the breath Of their injurious lives at length was spent, Into all noxious forms abhorr'd were sent, Of beasts and reptiles; so retaining still Their old propensities, on evil bent, They work'd where'er they might their wicked will, The natural foes of man, whom we pursue and kill. 30 Of better spirits, some there were who said That in the grave they had their place of rest. Lightly they laid the earth upon the dead, Lest in its narrow tenement the guest Should suffer underneath such load opprest. But that death surely set the spirit free, Sad proof to them poor Monnema addrest, Drawn from their father's fate; no grave had he Wherein his soul might dwell. This therefore could not be. 31 Likelier they taught who said that to the Land Of Souls the happy spirit took its flight, A region underneath the sole command Of the Good Power; by him for the upright Appointed and replenish'd with delight; A land where nothing evil ever came, Sorrow, nor pain, nor peril, nor affright, Nor change, nor death; but there the human frame, Untouch'd by age or ill, continued still the same. 32 Winds would not pierce it there, nor heat and cold Grieve, nor thirst parch and hunger pine; but there The sun by day its even influence hold With genial warmth, and thro' the unclouded air The moon upon her nightly journey fare: The lakes and fish-full streams are never dry; Trees ever green perpetual fruitage bear; And, wheresoe'er the hunter turns his eye, Water and earth and heaven to him their stores supply. 33 And once there was a way to that good land, For in mid-earth a wondrous Tree there grew, By which the adventurer might with foot and hand From branch to branch his upward course pursue; An easy path, if what were said be true, Albeit the ascent was long: and when the height Was gain'd, that blissful region was in view, Wherein the traveller safely might alight, And roam abroad at will, and take his free delight. 34 O happy time, when ingress thus was given To the upper world, and at their pleasure they Whose hearts were strong might pass from Earth to Heaven By their own act and choice! In evil day Mishap had fatally cut off that way, And none may now the Land of Spirits gain, Till from its dear-loved tenement of clay, Violence or age, infirmity and pain Divorce the soul which there full gladly would remain. 35 Such grievous loss had by their own misdeed Upon the unworthy race of men been brought. An aged woman once who could not speed In fishing, earnestly one day besought Her countrymen, that they of what they caught A portion would upon her wants bestow. They set her hunger and her age at nought, And still to her entreaties answered no! And mock'd her, till they made her heart with rage o'erflow. 36 But that Old Woman by such wanton wrong Inflamed, went hurrying down; and in the pride Of magic power wherein the crone was strong, Her human form infirm she laid aside. Better the Capiguara's limbs supplied A strength accordant to her fierce intent: These she assumed, and, burrowing deep and wide Beneath the Tree, with vicious will, she went, To inflict upon mankind a lasting punishment. 37 Downward she wrought her way, and all around Labouring, the solid earth she undermined And loosen'd all the roots; then from the ground Emerging, in her hatred of her kind, Resumed her proper form, and breathed a wind Which gather'd like a tempest round its head: Eftsoon the lofty Tree its top inclined Uptorn with horrible convulsion dread, And over half the world its mighty wreck lay spread. 38 But never scion sprouted from that Tree, Nor seed sprang up; and thus the easy way, Which had till then for young and old been free, Was closed upon the sons of men for aye. The mighty ruin moulder'd where it lay Till not a trace was left; and now in sooth Almost had all remembrance past away. This from the elders she had heard in youth; Some said it was a tale, and some a very truth. 39 Nathless departed spirits at their will Could from the Land of Souls pass to and fro; They come to us in sleep when all is still, Sometimes to warn against the impending blow, Alas! more oft to visit us in woe: Though in their presence there was poor relief! And this had sad experience made her know, For when Quiara came, his stay was brief, And waking then, she felt a freshen'd sense of grief. 40 Yet to behold his face again, and hear His voice, though painful was a deep delight: It was a joy to think that he was near, To see him in the visions of the night, . . . To know that the departed still requite The love which to their memory still will cling: And though he might not bless her waking sight With his dear presence, 'twas a blessed thing That sleep would thus sometimes his actual image bring. 41 Why comes he not to me? Yeruti cries: And Mooma echoing with a sigh the thought, Ask'd why it was that to her longing eyes No dream the image of her father brought? Nor Monnema to solve that question sought In vain, content in ignorance to dwell; Perhaps it was because they knew him not; Perhaps . . . but sooth she could not answer well; What the departed did, themselves alone could tell. 42 What one tribe held another disbelieved, For all concerning this was dark, she said; Uncertain all, and hard to be received. The dreadful race, from whom their fathers fled, Boasted that even the Country of the Dead Was theirs, and where their Spirits chose to go, The ghosts of other men retired in dread Before the face of that victorious foe; No better, then, the world above, than this below! 43 What then, alas! if this were true, was death? Only a mournful change from ill to ill! And some there were who said the living breath Would ne'er be taken from us by the will Of the Good Father, but continue still To feed with life the mortal frame he gave, Did not mischance or wicked witchcraft kill; . . . Evils from which no care avail'd to save, And whereby all were sent to fill the greedy grave. 44 In vain to counterwork the baleful charm By spells of rival witchcraft was it sought, Less potent was that art to help than harm. No means of safety old experience brought: Nor better fortune did they find who thought From Death, as from some living foe, to fly: For speed or subterfuge avail'd them nought, But wheresoe'er they fled they found him nigh: None ever could elude that unseen enemy. 45 Bootless the boast, and vain the proud intent Of those who hoped, with arrogant display Of arms and force, to scare him from their tent, As if their threatful shouts and fierce array Of war could drive the Invisible away! Sometimes regardless of the sufferer's groan, They dragg'd the dying out and as a prey Exposed him, that content with him alone Death might depart, and thus his fate avert their own. 46 Depart he might, . . . but only to return In quest of other victims, soon or late; When they who held this fond belief, would learn, Each by his own inevitable fate, That in the course of man's uncertain state Death is the one and only certain thing. Oh folly then to fly or deprecate That which at last Time, ever on the wing, Certain as day and night, to weary age must bring! 47 While thus the Matron spake, the youthful twain Listen'd in deep attention, wistfully; Whether with more of wonder or of pain Uneath it were to tell. With steady eye Intent they heard; and when she paused, a sigh Their sorrowful foreboding seem'd to speak: Questions to which she could not give reply Yeruti ask'd; and for that Maiden meek, . . . Involuntary tears ran down her quiet cheek. 48 A different sentiment within them stirr'd, When Monnema recall'd to mind one day, Imperfectly, what she had sometimes heard In childhood, long ago, the Elders say: Almost from memory had it past away, . . . How there appear'd amid the woodlands men Whom the Great Spirit sent there to convey His gracious will; but little heed she then Had given, and like a dream it now recurr'd again. 49 But these young questioners from time to time Call'd up the long-forgotten theme anew. Strange men they were, from some remotest clime She said, of different speech, uncouth to view, Having hair upon their face, and white in hue: Across the World of waters wide they came Devotedly the Father's work to do, And seek the Red-Men out, and in his name His merciful laws, and love, and promises proclaim. 50 They served a Maid more beautiful than tongue Could tell, or heart conceive. Of human race, All heavenly as that Virgin was, she sprung; But for her beauty and celestial grace, Being one in whose pure elements no trace Had e'er inhered of sin or mortal stain, The highest Heaven was now her dwelling place; There as a Queen divine she held her reign, And there in endless joy for ever would remain. 51 Her feet upon the crescent Moon were set, And, moving in their order round her head, The Stars compose her sparkling coronet. There at her breast the Virgin Mother fed A Babe divine, who was to judge the dead, Such power the Spirit gave this aweful Child; Severe he was, and in his anger dread, Yet alway at his Mother's will grew mild, So well did he obey that Maiden undefiled. 52 Sometimes she had descended from above To visit her true votaries, and requite Such as had served her well. And for her love, These bearded men, forsaking all delight, With labour long and dangers infinite, Across the great blue waters came, and sought The Red-Men here, to win them, if they might, From bloody ways, rejoiced to profit aught Even when with their own lives the benefit was bought. 53 For trusting in this heavenly Maiden's grace, It was for them a joyful thing to die, As men who went to have their happy place With her, and with that Holy Child, on high, In fields of bliss above the starry sky, In glory, at the Virgin Mother's feet: And all who kept their lessons faithfully An everlasting guerdon there would meet, When Death had led their souls to that celestial seat. 54 On earth they offer'd, too, an easy life To those who their mild lessons would obey, Exempt from want, from danger, and from strife; And from the forest leading them away, They placed them underneath this Virgin's sway, A numerous fellowship, in peace to dwell; Their high and happy office there to pay Devotions due, which she requited well, Their heavenly Guardian she in whatsoe'er befell. 55 Thus, Monnema remember'd, it was told By one who in his hot and headstrong youth Had left her happy service; but when old Lamented oft with unavailing ruth, And thoughts which sharper than a serpent's tooth Pierced him, that he had changed that peaceful place For the fierce freedom and the ways uncouth Of their wild life, and lost that Lady's grace, Wherefore he had no hope to see in Heaven her face. 56 And she remember'd too when first they fled For safety to the farthest solitude Before their cruel foes, and lived in dread That thither too their steps might be pursued By those old enemies athirst for blood; How some among them hoped to see the day When these beloved messengers of good To that lone hiding place might find the way, And them to their abode of blessedness convey. 57 Such tales excited in Yeruti's heart A stirring hope that haply he might meet Some minister of Heaven; and many a part Untrod before of that wild wood retreat, Did he with indefatigable feet Explore; yet ever from the fruitless quest Return'd at evening to his native seat By daily disappointment undeprest, . . . So buoyant was the hope that fill'd his youthful breast. 58 At length the hour approach'd that should fulfil His harmless heart's desire, when they shall see Their fellow-kind, and take for good or ill The fearful chance, for such it needs must be, Of change from that entire simplicity. Yet wherefore should the thought of change appal? Grief it perhaps might bring, and injury, And death; . . . but evil never can befall The virtuous, for the Eye of Heaven is over all. CANTO III. 1 Amid those marshy woodlands far and wide Which spread beyond the soaring vulture's eye, There grew on Empalado's southern side Groves of that tree whose leaves adust supply The Spaniards with their daily luxury; A beverage whose salubrious use obtains Through many a land of mines and slavery, Even over all La Plata's sea-like plains, And Chili's mountain realm, and proud Peru's domains. 2 But better for the injured Indian race Had woods of manchineel the land o'erspread: Yea, in that tree so blest by Nature's grace A direr curse had they inherited, Than if the Upas there had rear'd its head And sent its baleful scions all around, Blasting where'er its effluent force was shed, In air and water, and the infected ground, All things wherein the breath or sap of life is found. 3 The poor Guaranies dreamt of no such ill, When for themselves in miserable hour, The virtues of that leaf, with pure good will They taught their unsuspected visitor, New in the land as yet. They learnt his power Too soon, which law nor conscience could restrain, A fearless but inhuman conqueror, Heart-harden'd by the accursed lust of gain, O fatal thirst of gold! O foul reproach for Spain! 4 For gold and silver had the Spaniards sought Exploring Paraguay with desperate pains, Their way through forests axe in hand they wrought; Drench'd from above by unremitting rains They waded over inundated plains, Forward by hope of plunder still allured; So they might one day count their golden gains, They cared not at what cost of sin procured, All dangers they defied, all sufferings they endured. 5 Barren alike of glory and of gold That region proved to them; nor would the soil Unto their unindustrious hands unfold Harvests, the fruit of peace, . . . and wine and oil, The treasures that repay contented toil With health and weal; treasures that with them bring No guilt for priest and penance to assoil, Nor with their venom arm the awaken'd sting Of conscience at that hour when life is vanishing. 6 But keen of eye in their pursuit of gain The conquerors look'd for lucre in this tree: An annual harvest there might they attain, Without the cost of annual industry. 'Twas but to gather in what there grew free And share Potosi's wealth. Nor thence alone. But gold in glad exchange they soon should see From all that once the Incas called their own, Or where the Zippa's power or Zaque's laws were known. 7 For this, in fact though not in name a slave, The Indian from his family was torn; And droves on droves were sent to find a grave In woods and swamps, by toil severe outworn, No friend at hand to succour or to mourn, In death unpitied, as in life unblest. O miserable race, to slavery born! Yet when we look beyond this world's unrest, More miserable then the oppressors than the opprest. 8 Often had Kings essay'd to check the ill By edicts not so well enforced as meant; A present power was wanting to fulfil Remote authority's sincere intent. To Avarice, on its present purpose bent, The voice of distant Justice spake in vain; False magistrates and priests their influence lent The accursed thing for lucre to maintain: O fatal thirst of gold! O foul reproach for Spain! 9 O foul reproach! but not for Spain alone But for all lands that bear the Christian name! Where'er commercial slavery is known; O shall not Justice trumpet-tongued proclaim The foul reproach, the black offence the same? Hear, guilty France! and thou, O England, hear! Thou who hast half redeem'd thyself from shame, When slavery from thy realms shall disappear, Then from this guilt, and not till then, wilt thou be clear. 10 Uncheck'd in Paraguay it ran its course, Till all the gentler children of the land Well nigh had been consumed without remorse. The bolder tribes meantime, whose skilful hand Had tamed the horse, in many a warlike band Kept the field well with bow and dreadful spear. And now the Spaniards dared no more withstand Their force, but in their towns grew pale with fear If the Mocobio, or the A bipon drew near. 11 Bear witness, Chaco, thou, from thy domain With Spanish blood, as erst with Indian, fed! And Corrientes, by whose church the slain Were piled in heaps, till for the gather'd dead One common grave was dug, one service said! Thou too, Parana, thy sad witness bear From shores with many a mournful vestige spread, And monumental crosses here and there, And monumental names that tell where dwellings were! 12 Nor would with all their power the Kings of Spain, Austrian or Bourbon, have at last avail'd This torrent of destruction to restrain, And save a people every where assail'd By men before whose face their courage quail'd, But for the virtuous agency of those Who with the Cross alone, when arms had fail'd, Achieved a peaceful triumph o'er the foes, And gave that weary land the blessings of repose. 13 For whensoe'er the Spaniards felt or fear'd An Indian enemy, they call'd for aid Upon Loyola's sons, now long endear'd To many a happy tribe, by them convey'd From the open wilderness or woodland shade, In towns of happiest polity to dwell. Freely these faithful ministers essay'd The arduous enterprize, contented well If with success they sped, or if as martyrs fell. 14 And now it chanced some traders who had fell'd The trees of precious foliage far and wide On Empalado's shore, when they beheld The inviting woodlands on its northern side, Crost thither in their quest, and there espied Yeruti's footsteps: searching then the shade At length a lonely dwelling they descried, And at the thought of hostile hordes dismay'd To the nearest mission sped and ask'd the Jesuit's aid. 15 That was a call which ne'er was made in vain Upon Loyola's sons. In Paraguay Much of injustice had they to complain, Much of neglect; but faithful labourers they In the Lord's vineyard, there was no delay When summon'd to his work. A little band Of converts made them ready for the way; Their spiritual father took a Cross in hand To be his staff, and forth they went to search the land. 16 He was a man of rarest qualities, Who to this barbarous region had confined A spirit with the learned and the wise Worthy to take its place, and from mankind Receive their homage, to the immortal mind Paid in its just inheritance of fame. But he to humbler thoughts his heart inclined; From Gratz amid the Styrian hills he came, And Dobrizhoffer was the good man's honour'd name. 17 It was his evil fortune to behold The labours of his painful life destroy'd; His flock which he had brought within the fold Dispersed; the work of ages render'd void, And all of good that Paraguay enjoy'd By blind and suicidal Power o'erthrown. So he the years of his old age employ'd, A faithful chronicler in handing down Names which he loved, and things well worthy to be known. 18 And thus when exiled from the dear-loved scene, In proud Vienna he beguiled the pain Of sad remembrance: and the Empress Queen, That great Teresa, she did not disdain In gracious mood sometimes to entertain Discourse with him both pleasurable and sage; And sure a willing ear she well might deign To one whose tales may equally engage The wondering mind of youth, the thoughtful heart of age. 19 But of his native speech because well nigh Disuse in him forgetfulness had wrought, In Latin he composed his history; A garrulous, but a lively tale, and fraught With matter of delight and food for thought. And if he could in Merlin's glass have seen By whom his tomes to speak our tongue were taught, The old man would have felt as pleased, I ween, As when he won the ear of that great Empress Queen. 20 Little he deem'd when with his Indian band He through the wilds set forth upon his way, A Poet then unborn, and in a land Which had proscribed his order, should one day Take up from thence his moralizing lay, And shape a song that, with no fiction drest, Should to his worth its grateful tribute pay, And sinking deep in many an English breast, Foster that faith divine that keeps the heart at rest. 21 Behold him on his way! the breviary Which from his girdle hangs, his only shield; That well-known habit is his panoply, That Cross, the only weapon he will wield: By day he bears it for his staff afield, By night it is the pillar of his bed; No other lodging these wild woods can yield Than earth's hard lap, and rustling overhead A canopy of deep and tangled boughs far spread. 22 Yet may they not without some cautious care Take up their inn content upon the ground. First it behoves to clear a circle there, And trample down the grass and plantage round, Where many a deadly reptile might be found, Whom with its bright and comfortable heat The flame would else allure: such plagues abound In these thick woods, and therefore must they beat The earth, and trample well the herbs beneath their feet. 23 And now they heap dry reeds and broken wood; The spark is struck, the crackling faggots blaze, And cheer that unaccustom'd solitude. Soon have they made their frugal meal of maize; In grateful adoration then they raise The evening hymn. How solemn in the wild That sweet accordant strain where with they praise The Queen of Angels, merciful and mild: Hail, holiest Mary! Maid, and Mother undefiled. 24 Blame as thou may'st the Papist's erring creed, But not their salutary rite of even! The prayers that from a pious soul proceed, Though misdirected, reach the ear of Heaven. Us unto whom a purer faith is given, As our best birthright it behoves to hold The precious charge; but, oh, beware the leaven Which makes the heart of charity grow cold! We own one Shepherd, we shall be at last one fold. 25 Thinkest thou the little company who here Pour forth their hymn devout at close of day, Feel it no aid that those who hold them dear, At the same hour the self-same homage pay, Commending them to Heaven when far away? That the sweet bells are heard in solemn chime Through all the happy towns of Paraguay, Where now their brethren in one point of time Join in the general prayer, with sympathy sublime? 26 That to the glorious Mother of their Lord Whole Christendom that hour its homage pays? From court and cottage that with one accord Ascends the universal strain of praise? Amid the crowded city's restless ways, One reverential thought pervades the throng; The traveller on his lonely road obeys The sacred hour, and as he fares along, In spirit hears and joins his household's even-song. 27 What if they think that every prayer enroll'd Shall one day in their good account appear; That guardian Angels hover round and fold Their wings in adoration while they hear; Ministrant Spirits through the ethereal sphere Waft it with joy, and to the grateful theme Well pleased, the Mighty Mother bends her ear? A vain delusion this we rightly deem: Yet what they feel is not a mere illusive dream. 28 That prayer perform'd, around the fire reclined Beneath the leafy canopy they lay Their limbs: the Indians soon to sleep resign'd; And the good Father with that toilsome day Fatigued, full fain to sleep, . . . if sleep he may, Whom all tormenting insects there assail; More to be dreaded these than beasts of prey Against whom strength may cope, or skill prevail, But art of man against these enemies must fail. 29 Patience itself that should the sovereign cure For ills that touch ourselves alone, supply, Lends little aid to one who must endure This plague: the small tormentors fill the sky, And swarm about their prey; there he must lie And suffer while the hours of darkness wear; At times he utters with a deep-drawn sigh Some name adored, in accents of despair Breathed sorrowfully forth, half murmur and half prayer. 30 Welcome to him the earliest gleam of light; Welcome to him the earliest sound of day; That from the sufferings of that weary night Released, he may resume his willing way, Well pleased again the perils to essay Of that drear wilderness, with hope renew'd: Success will all his labours overpay, A quest like his is cheerfully pursued, The heart is happy still that is intent on good. 31 And now where Empalado's waters creep Through low and level shores of woodland wide, They come; prepared to cross the sluggish deep, An ill-shaped coracle of hardest hide, Ruder than ever Cambrian fisher plied Where Towey and the salt-sea waters meet, The Indians launch; they steady it and guide, Winning their way with arms and practised feet, While in the tottering boat the Father keeps his seat. 32 For three long summer days on every side They search in vain the sylvan solitude; The fourth a human footstep is espied, And through the mazes of the pathless wood With hound-like skill and hawk-like eye pursued; For keen upon their pious quest are they As e'er were hunters on the track of blood. Where softer ground or trodden herbs betray The slightest mark of man, they there explore the way. 33 More cautious when more certain of the trace In silence they proceed; not like a crew Of jovial hunters, who the joyous chase With hound and horn in open field pursue, Cheering their way with jubilant halloo, And hurrying forward to their spoil desired, The panting game before them, full in view: Humaner thoughts this little band inspired, Yet with a hope as high their gentle hearts were fired. 34 Nor is their virtuous hope devoid of fear; The perils of that enterprise they know, Some savage horde may have its fastness here, A race to whom a stranger is a foe, Who not for friendly words, nor proffer'd show Of gifts, will peace or parley entertain. If by such hands their blameless blood should flow To serve the Lamb who for their sins was slain, Blessed indeed their lot, for so to die is gain! 35 Them thus pursuing where the track may lead, A human voice arrests upon their way; They stop, and thither whence the sounds proceed, All eyes are turn'd in wonder, . . . not dismay, For sure such sounds might charm all fear away; No nightingale whose brooding mate is nigh, From some sequester'd bower at close of day, No lark rejoicing in the orient sky, Ever pour'd forth so wild a strain of melody. 36 The voice which through the ringing forest floats Is one which having ne'er been taught the skill Of marshalling sweet words to sweeter notes, Utters all unpremeditate, at will, A modulated sequence loud and shrill Of inarticulate and long-breathed sound, Varying its tones with rise and fall and trill, Till all the solitary woods around With that far-piercing power of melody resound. 37 In mute astonishment attent to hear, As if by some enchantment held, they stood, With bending head, fix'd eye, and eager ear, And hand upraised in warning attitude To check all speech or step that might intrude On that sweet strain. Them leaving thus spell-bound, A little way alone into the wood The Father gently moved toward the sound, Treading with quiet feet upon the grassy ground. 38 Anon advancing thus the trees between, He saw beside her bower the songstress wild, Not distant far, himself the while unseen. Mooma it was, that happy maiden mild, Who in the sunshine, like a careless child Of nature, in her joy was caroling. A heavier heart than his it had beguiled So to have heard so fair a creature sing The strains which she had learnt from all sweet birds of spring. 39 For these had been her teachers, these alone; And she in many an emulous essay, At length into a descant of her own Had blended all their notes, a wild display Of sounds in rich irregular array; And now as blithe as bird in vernal bower, Pour'd in full flow the unexpressive lay, Rejoicing in her consciousness of power, But in the inborn sense of harmony yet more. 40 In joy had she begun the ambitious song, With rapid interchange of sink and swell; And sometimes high the note was raised, and long Produced, with shake and effort sensible, As if the voice exulted there to dwell; But when she could no more that pitch sustain, So thrillingly attuned the cadence fell, That with the music of its dying strain She moved herself to tears of pleasurable pain. 41 It might be deem'd some dim presage possess'd The virgin's soul; that some mysterious sense Of change to come, upon her mind impress'd, Had then call'd forth, ere she departed thence, A requiem to their days of innocence. For what thou losest in thy native shade There is one change alone that may compense, O Mooma, innocent and simple maid, Only one change, and it will not be long delay'd! 42 When now the Father issued from the wood Into that little glade in open sight, Like one entranced, beholding him, she stood; Yet had she more of wonder than affright, Yet less of wonder than of dread delight, When thus the actual vision came in view; For instantly the maiden read aright Wherefore he came; his garb and beard she knew; All that her mother heard had then indeed been true. 43 Nor was the Father fill'd with less surprise; He too strange fancies well might entertain, When this so fair a creature met his eyes. He might have thought her not of mortal strain; Rather, as bards of yore were wont to feign, A nymph divine of Mondai's secret stream; Or haply of Diana's woodland train: For in her beauty Mooma such might seem, Being less a child of earth than like a poet's dream. 44 No art of barbarous ornament had scarr'd And stain'd her virgin limbs, or 'filed her face; Nor ever yet had evil passion marr'd In her sweet countenance the natural grace Of innocence and youth; nor was there trace Of sorrow, or of hardening want and care. Strange was it in this wild and savage place, Which seem'd to be for beasts a fitting lair, Thus to behold a maid so gentle and so fair. 45 Across her shoulders was a hammock flung, By night it was the maiden's bed, by day Her only garment. Round her as it hung, In short unequal folds of loose array, The open meshes, when she moves, display Herform. Shestood with fix'd and wondering eyes, And trembling like a leaf upon the spray, Even for excess of joy, with eager cries She call'd her mother forth to share that glad surprise. 46 At that unwonted call with quicken'd pace The matron hurried thither, half in fear. How strange to Monnema a stranger's face! How strange it was a stranger's voice to hear, How strangely to her disaccustom'd ear Came even the accents of her native tongue! But when she saw her countrymen appear, Tears for that unexpected blessing sprung, And once again she felt as if her heart were young. 47 Soon was her melancholy story told, And glad consent unto that Father good Was given, that they to join his happy fold Would leave with him their forest solitude. Why comes not now Yeruti from the wood? Why tarrieth he so late this blessed day? They long to see their joy in his renew'd, And look impatiently toward his way, And think they hear his step, and chidehis long delay 48 He comes at length, a happy man, to find His only dream of hope fulfill'd at last. The sunshine of his all-believing mind There is no doubt or fear to overcast; No chilling forethought checks his bliss; the past Leaves no regret for him, and all to come Is change and wonder and delight. How fast Hath busy fancy conjured up a sum Of joys unknown, whereof the expectance makes him dumb. 49 O happy day, the Messenger of Heaven Hath found them in their lonely dwelling place! O happy day, to them it would be given To share in that Eternal Mother's grace, And one day see in heaven her glorious face Where Angels round her mercy-throne adore! Now shall they mingle with the human race, Sequester'd from their fellow-kind no more; O joy of joys supreme! O bliss for them in store! 50 Full of such hopes this night they lay them down, But not as they were wont, this night to rest. Their old tranquillity of heart is gone; The peace wherewith till now they have been blest Hath taken its departure. In the breast Fast following thoughts and busy fancies throng; Their sleep itself is feverish, and possest With dreams that to the wakeful mind belong; To Mooma and the youth then first the night seem'd long. 51 Day comes, and now a first and last farewell To that fair bower within their native wood, Their quiet nest till now. The bird may dwell Henceforth in safety there, and rear her brood, And beasts and reptiles undisturb'd intrude; Reckless of this, the simple tenants go, Emerging from their peaceful solitude, To mingle with the world, . . . but not to know Its crimes, nor to partake its cares, nor feel its woe. CANTO IV. 1 The bells rung blithely from St. Mary's tower When in St. Joachin's the news was told That Dobrizhoffer from his quest that hour Drew nigh: the glad Guaranies young and old Throng through the gate, rejoicing to behold His face again; and all with heartfelt glee Welcome the Pastor to his peaceful fold, Where so beloved amid his flock was he That this return was like a day of jubilee. 2 How more than strange, how marvellous a sight To the new comers was this multitude! Something like fear was mingled with affright When they the busy scene of turmoil view'd; Wonder itself the sense of joy subdued, And with its all-unwonted weight opprest These children of the quiet solitude; And now and then a sigh that heaved the breast Unconsciously bewray'd their feeling of unrest. 3 Not more prodigious than that little town Seem'd to these comers, were the pomp and power To us, of ancient Rome in her renown; Nor the elder Babylon, or ere that hour When her high gardens, and her cloud-capttower, And her broad walls before the Persian fell; Nor those dread fanes on Nile's forsaken shore Whose ruins yet their pristine grandeur tell, Wherein the demon Gods themselves might deign to dwell. 4 But if, all humble as it was, that scene Possess'd a poor and uninstructed mind With awe, the thoughtful spirit, well I ween, Something to move its wonder there might find, Something of consolation for its kind, Some hope and earnest of a happier age, When vain pursuits no more the heart shall blind, But Faith the evils of this earth assuage, And to all souls assure their heavenly heritage. 5 Yes; for in history's mournful map, the eye On Paraguay, as on a sunny spot, May rest complacent: to humanity, There, and there only, hath a peaceful lot Been granted, by Ambition troubled not, By A varice undebased, exempt from care, By perilous passions undisturb'd. And what If Glory never rear'd her standard there, Nor with her clarion's blast awoke the slumbering air? 6 Content and cheerful Piety were found Within those humble walls. From youth to age The simple dwellers paced their even round Of duty, not desiring to engage Upon the busy world's contentious stage, Whose ways they wisely had been train'd to dread: Their inoffensive lives in pupilage Perpetually, but peacefully they led, From all temptation saved, and sure of daily bread. 7 They on the Jesuit, who was nothing loth, Reposed alike their conscience and their cares; And he, with equal faith, the trust of both Accepted and discharged. The bliss is theirs Of that entire dependence that prepares Entire submission, let what may befall; And his whole careful course of life declares That for their good he holds them thus in thrall, Their Father and their Friend, Priest, Ruler, all in all. 8 Food, raiment, shelter, safety, he provides; No forecast, no anxieties have they; The Jesuit governs, and instructs and guides; Their part it is to honour and obey, Like children under wise parental sway. All thoughts and wishes are to him confess'd; And when at length in life's last weary day In sure and certain hope they sink to rest, By him their eyes are closed, by him their burial blest. 9 Deem not their lives of happiness devoid, Though thus the years their course obscurely fill; In rural and in household arts employ'd, And many a pleasing task of pliant skill, For emulation here unmix'd with ill, Sufficient scope was given. Each had assign'd His proper part, which yet left free the will; So well they knew to mould the ductile mind By whom the scheme of that wise order was combined. 10 It was a land of priestcraft, but the Priest Believed himself the fables that he taught: Corrupt their forms, and yet those forms at least Preserv'd a salutary faith that wrought, Maugre the alloy, the saving end it sought. Benevolence had gain'd such empire there, That even superstition had been brought An aspect of humanity to wear, And make the weal of man its first and only care. 11 Nor lack'd they store of innocent delight, Music and song and dance and proud array, Whate'er might win the ear, or charm the sight; Banners and pageantry in rich display Brought forth upon some Saint's high holyday, The altar drest, the church with garlands hung, Arches and floral bowers beside the way, And festal tables spread for old and young, Gladness in every heart, and mirth on every tongue. 12 Thou who despisest so debased a fate, As in the pride of wisdom thou may'st call These meek submissive Indians' low estate, Look round the world, and see where over all Injurious passions hold mankind in thrall, How barbarous Force asserts a ruthless reign, Or Mammon, o'er his portion of the ball, Hath learn'd a baser empire to maintain, Mammon, the god of all who give their souls to gain. 13 Behold the fraudful arts, the covert strife, The jarring interests that engross mankind; The low pursuits, the selfish aims of life; Studies that weary and contract the mind, That bring no joy, and leave no peace behind; And Death approaching to dissolve the spell! The immortal soul, which hath so long been blind, Recovers then clear sight, and sees too well The error of its ways, when irretrievable. 14 Far happier the Guaranies' humble race, With whom in dutiful contentment wise, The gentle virtues had their dwelling-place. With them the dear domestic charities Sustain'd no blight from fortune; natural ties There suffer'd no divorcement, save alone That which in course of nature might arise; No artificial wants and ills were known; But there they dweltas if the world were all their own. 15 Obedience in its laws that takes delight Was theirs; simplicity that knows no art; Love, friendship, grateful duty in its height; Meekness and truth, that keep all strife apart, And faith and hope which elevate the heart Upon its heavenly heritage intent. Poor, erring, self-tormentor that thou art, O Man! and on thine own undoing bent, Where with canst thou be blest, if not with these content? 16 Mild pupils in submission's perfect school, Two thousand souls were gather'd here, and here Beneath the Jesuit's all-embracing rule They dwelt, obeying him with love sincere, That never knew distrust, nor felt a fear, Nor anxious thought which wears the heart away. Sacred to them their laws, their Ruler dear; Humbler or happier none could be than they Who knew it for their good in all things to obey. 17 The Patron Saint, from whom their town was named Was that St. Joachin, who, legends say, Unto the Saints in Limbo first proclaim'd The Advent. Being permitted, on the day That Death enlarged him from this mortal clay, His daughter's high election to behold, Thither his soul, glad herald, wing'd its way, And to the Prophets and the Patriarchs old The tidings of great joy and near deliverance told. 18 There on the altar was his image set, The lamp before it burning night and day, And there was incensed, when his votaries met Before the sacred shrine, their beads to say, And for his fancied intercession pray, Devoutly as in faith they bent the knee. Such adoration they were taught to pay; Good man, how little had he ween'd that he Should thus obtain a place in Rome's idolatry! 19 But chiefly there the Mother of our Lord, His blessed daughter, by the multitude Was for their special patroness adored. Amid the square on high her image stood, Clasping the Babe in her beatitude, The Babe Divine on whom she fix'd her sight; And in their hearts, albe the work was rude, It rais'd the thought of all-commanding might, Combin'd with boundless love and mercy infinite. 20 To this great family the Jesuit brought His new-found children now; for young and old He deem'd alike his children while he wrought For their salvation, . . . seeking to unfold The saving mysteries in the creed enroll'd, To their slow minds, that could but ill conceive The import of the mighty truths he told. But errors they have none to which they cleave, And whatsoe'er he tells they willingly believe. 21 Safe from that pride of ignorance were they That with small knowledge thinks itself full wise. How at believing aught should these delay, When every where new objects met their eyes To fill the soul with wonder and surprise? Not of itself, but by temptation bred, In man doth impious unbelief arise; It is our instinct to believe and dread, God bids us love, and then our faith is perfected. 22 Quick to believe, and slow to comprehend, Like children, unto all the teacher taught Submissively an easy ear they lend: And to the font at once he might have brought These converts, if the Father had not thought Theirs was a case for wise and safe delay, Lest lightly learnt might lightly be forgot; And meanwhile due instruction day by day Would to their opening minds the sense of truth convey. 23 Of this they reck'd not whether soon or late; For overpowering wonderment possest Their faculties; and in this new estate Strange sights and sounds and thoughts well nigh opprest Their sense, and raised a turmoil in the breast Resenting less of pleasure than of pain; And sleep afforded them no natural rest, But in their dreams, a mixed disorder'd train, The busy scenes of day disturb'd their hearts again. 24 Even when the spirit to that secret wood Return'd, slow Mondai's silent stream beside, No longer there it found the solitude Which late it left: strange faces were descried, Voices, and sounds of music far and wide, And buildings seem'd to tower amid the trees, And forms of men and beasts on every side, As ever wakeful fancy hears and sees, All things that it had heard, and seen, and more than these. 25 For in their sleep strange forms deform'd they saw Of frightful fiends, their ghostly enemies, And souls who must abide the rigorous law Weltering in fire, and there with dolorous cries Blaspheming roll around their hopeless eyes; And those who doom'd a shorter term to bear In penal flames, look upward to the skies, Seeking and finding consolation there, And feel, like dew from heaven, the precious aid of prayer. 26 And Angels who around their glorious Queen In adoration bent their heads abased; And infant faces in their dreams were seen Hovering on cherub-wings; and Spirits placed To be their guards invisible, who chased With fiery arms their fiendish foes away: Such visions overheated fancy traced, Peopling the night with a confused array That made its hours of rest more restless than the day. 27 To all who from an old erratic course Of life, within the Jesuit's fold were led, The change was perilous. They felt the force Of habit, when till then in forests bred, A thick perpetual umbrage overhead, They came to dwell in open light and air. This ill the Fathers long had learnt to dread, And still devised such means as might prepare The new-reclaim'd unhurt this total change to bear. 28 All thoughts and occupations to commute, To change their air, their water, and their food, And those old habits suddenly uproot Conform'd to which the vital powers pursued Their functions, such mutation is too rude For man's fine frame unshaken to sustain. And these poor children of the solitude Began ere long to pay the bitter pain That their new way of life brought with it in its train. 29 On Monnema the apprehended ill Came first; the matron sunk beneath the weight Of a strong malady, whose force no skill In healing might avert, or mitigate. Yet happy in her children's safe estate Her thankfulness for them she still exprest; And yielding then complacently to fate, With Christian rites her passing hour was blest, And with a Christian's hope she was consign'd to rest. 30 They laid her in the Garden of the Dead; Such as a Christian burial-place should be Was that fair spot, where every grave was spread With flowers, and not a weed to spring was free; But the pure blossoms of the orange tree Dropt like a shower of fragrance on the bier; And palms, the type of immortality, Planted in stately colonnades appear, That all was verdant there throughout the unvarying year. 31 Nor ever did irreverent feet intrude Within that sacred spot; nor sound of mirth, Unseemly there, profane the solitude, Where solemnly committed earth to earth, Waiting the summons for their second birth, Whole generations in Death's peaceful fold Collected lay; green innocence, ripe worth, Youth full of hope, and age whose days were told, Compress'd alike into that mass of mortal mould. 32 Mortal, and yet at the Archangel's voice To put on immortality. That call Shall one day make the sentient dust rejoice; These bodies then shall rise and cast off all Corruption, with whate'er of earthly thrall Had clogg'd the heavenly image, then set free. How then should Death a Christian's heart appal? Lo, Heaven for you is open; . . . enter ye Children of God, and heirs of his eternity! 33 This hope supported Mooma, hand in hand When with Yeruti at the grave she stood. Less even now of death they understand Than of the joys eternal that ensued; The bliss of infinite beatitude To them had been their teacher's favourite theme, Wherewith their hearts so fully were imbued, That it the sole reality might seem, Life, death, and all things else, a shadow or a dream. 34 Yea, so possest with that best hope were they, That if the heavens had opened overhead, And the Archangel with his trump that day To judgement had convoked the quick and dead, They would have heard the summons not with dread, But in the joy of faith that knows no fear; Come Lord! come quickly! would this pair have said, And thou O Queen of men and Angels dear, Lift us whom thou hast loved into thy happy sphere! 35 They wept not at the grave, though overwrought With feelings there as if the heart would break. Some haply might have deem'd they suffer'd not; Yet they who look'd upon that Maiden meek Might see what deep emotion blanched her cheek. An inward light there was which fill'd her eyes, And told, more forcibly than words could speak, That this disruption of her earliest ties Had shaken mind and frame in all their faculties. 36 It was not passion only that disturb'd Her gentle nature thus; it was not grief; Nor human feeling by the effort curb'd Of some misdeeming duty, when relief Were surely to be found, albeit brief, If sorrow at its springs might freely flow; Nor yet repining, stronger than belief In its first force, that shook the Maiden so, Though these alone might that frail fabric overthrow. 37 The seeds of death were in her at that hour, Soonwas their quick'ning and their growth display'd; Thenceforth she droop'd and wither'd like a flower, Which when it flourish'd in its native shade Some child to his own garden hath convey'd, And planted in the sun, to pine away. Thus was the gentle Mooma seen to fade, Not under sharp disease, but day by day Losing the powers of life in visible decay. 38 The sunny hue that tinged her cheek was gone, A deathy paleness settled in its stead; The light of joy which in her eyes had shone, Now like a lamp that is no longer fed Grew dim; but when she raised her heavy head Some proffer'd help of kindness to partake, Those feeble eyes a languid lustre shed, And her sad smile of thankfulness would wake Grief even in callous hearts for that sweet sufferer's sake. 39 How had Yeruti borne to see her fade? But he was spared the lamentable sight, Himself upon the bed of sickness laid. Joy of his heart, and of his eyes the light Had Mooma been to him, his soul's delight, On whom his mind for ever was intent, His darling thought by day, his dream by night, The playmate of his youth in mercy sent, With whom his life had past in peacefullest content. 40 Well was it for the youth, and well for her, As there in placid helplessness she lay, He was not present with his love to stir Emotions that might shake her feeble clay, And rouse up in her heart a strong array Of feelings, hurtful only when they bind To earth the soul that soon must pass away. But this was spared them; and no pain of mind To trouble her had she, instinctively resign'd. 41 Nor was there wanting to the sufferers aught Of careful kindness to alleviate The affliction; for the universal thought In that poor town was of their sad estate, And what might best relieve or mitigate Their case, what help of nature or of art; And many were the prayers compassionate That the good Saints their healing would impart, Breathed in that maid's behalf from many a tender heart. 42 And vows were made for her, if vows might save; She for herself the while preferr'd no prayer; For when she stood beside her Mother's grave, Her earthly hopes and thoughts had ended there. Her only longing now was, free as air From this obstructive flesh to take her flight For Paradise, and seek her Mother there, And then regaining her beloved sight Rest in the eternal sense of undisturb'd delight. 43 Her heart was there, and there she felt and knew That soon full surely should her spirit be. And who can tell what foretastes might ensue To one, whose soul, from all earth's thraldom free, Was waiting thus for immortality? Sometimes she spake with short and hurried breath As if some happy sight she seem'd to see, While in the fulness of perfect faith Even with a lover's hope she lay and look'd for death. 44 I said that for herself the patient maid Preferr'd no prayer; but oft her feeble tongue And feebler breath a voice of praise essay'd; And duly when the vesper bell was rung, Her evening hymn in faint accord she sung So piously, that they who gathered round A we-stricken on her heavenly accents hung, As though they thought it were no mortal sound, But that the place whereon they stood was holy ground. 45 At such an hour when Dobrizhoffer stood Beside her bed, oh! how unlike, he thought, This voice to that which ringing through the wood Had led him to the secret bower he sought! And was it then for this that he had brought That harmless household from their native shade? Death had already been the mother's lot; And this fair Mooma, was she form'd to fade So soon, . . . so soon must she in earth's cold lap be laid? 46 Yet he had no misgiving at the sight; And wherefore should he? he had acted well, And deeming of the ways of God aright, Knew that to such as these, whate'er befell Must needs for them be best. But who could dwell Unmmoved upon the fate of one so young, So blithesome late? What marvel if tears fell, From that good man as over her he hung, And that the prayers he said came faltering from his tongue! 47 She saw him weep, and she could understand The cause thus tremulously that made him speak. By his emotion moved she took his hand; A gleam of pleasure o'er her pallid cheek Past, while she look'd at him with meaning meek, And for a little while, as loth to part, Detaining him, her fingers lank and weak, Play'd with their hold; then letting him depart She gave him a slow smile that touch'd him to the heart. 48 Mourn not for her! for what hath life to give That should detain her ready spirit here? Thinkest thou that it were worth a wish to live, Could wishes hold her from her proper sphere? That simple heart, that innocence sincere The world would stain. Fitter she ne'er could be For the great change; and now that change is near, Oh who would keep her soul from being free? Maiden beloved of Heaven, to die is best for thee! 49 She hath past away, and on her lips a smile Hath settled, fix'd in death. Judged they aright, Or suffered they their fancy to beguile The reason, who believed that she had sight Of Heaven before her spirit took its flight; That Angels waited round her lowly bed; And that in that last effort of delight, When lifting up her dying arms, she said, I come! a ray from heaven upon her face was shed? 50 St. Joachin's had never seen a day Of such profuse and general grief before, As when with tapers, dirge, and long array The Maiden's body to the grave they bore. All eyes, all hearts, her early death deplore; Yet wondering at the fortune they lament, They the wise ways of Providence adore, By whom the Pastor surely had been sent When to the Mondai woods upon his quest he went. 51 This was, indeed, a chosen family, For Heaven's especial favour mark'd, they said; Shut out from all mankind they seem'd to be, Yet mercifully there were visited, That so within the fold they might be led, Then call'd away to bliss. Already two In their baptismal innocence were dead; The third was on the bed of death they knew, And in the appointed course must presently ensue. 52 They marvell'd, therefore, when the youth once more Rose from his bed and walk'd abroad again; Severe had been the malady, and sore The trial, while life struggled to maintain Its seat against the sharp assaults of pain: But life in him was vigorous; long he lay Ere it could its ascendancy regain, Then when the natural powers resumed their sway All trace of late disease past rapidly away. 53 The first inquiry when his mind was free, Was for his sister. She was gone, they said, Gone to her Mother, evermore to be With her in Heaven. At this no tears he shed, Nor was he seen to sorrow for the dead; But took the fatal tidings in such part As if a dull unfeeling nature bred His unconcern; for hard would seem the heart To which a loss like his no suffering could impart. 54 How little do they see what is, who frame Their hasty judgement upon that which seems! Waters that babble on their way proclaim A shallowness: but in their strength deep streams Flow silently. Of death Yeruti deems Not as an ill, but as the last great good, Compared wherewith all other he esteems Transient and void: how then should thought intrude Of sorrow in his heart for their beatitude? 55 While dwelling in their sylvan solitude Less had Yeruti learnt to entertain A sense of age than death. He understood Something of death from creatures he had slain; But here the ills which follow in the train Of age had first to him been manifest, . . . The shrunken form, the limbs that move with pain, The failing sense, infirmity, unrest, . . . That in his heart he said to die betimes was best. 56 Nor had he lost the dead: they were but gone Before him, whither he should shortly go. Their robes of glory they had first put on; He, cumber'd with mortality, below Must yet abide awhile, content to know He should not wait in long expectance here. What cause then for repining, or for woe? Soon shall he join them in their heavenly sphere, And often, even now, he knew that they were near. 57 'Twas but in open day to close his eyes, And shut out the unprofitable view Of all this weary world's realities, And forthwith, even as if they lived anew, The dead were with him; features, form and hue, And looks and gestures were restored again: Their actual presence in his heart he knew; And when their converse was disturb'd, oh then How flat and stale it was to mix with living men! 58 But not the less, whate'er was to be done, With living men he took his part content, At loom, in garden, or a-field, as one Whose spirit wholly on obedience bent, To every task its prompt attention lent. Alert in labour he among the best; And when to church the congregation went, None more exact than he to cross his breast, And kneel, or rise, and do in all things like the rest. 59 Cheerful he was, almost like one elate With wine, before it hath disturb'd his power Of reason. Yet he seem'd to feel the weight Of time; for always when from yonder tower He heard the clock tell out the passing hour, The sound appeared to give him some delight: And when the evening shades began to lower, Then was he seen to watch the fading light As if his heart rejoiced at the return of night. 60 The old man to whom he had been given in care, To Dobrizhoffer came one day and said, The trouble which our youth was thought to bear With such indifference hath deranged his head. He says that he is nightly visited; His Mother and his Sister come and say That he must give this message from the dead, Not to defer his baptism, and delay A soul upon the earth which should no longer stay. 61 A dream the Jesuit deem'd it; a deceit Upon itself by feverish fancy wrought; A mere delusion which it were not meet To censure, lest the youth's distemper'd thought Might thereby be to farther error brought; But he himself its vanity would find, . . . They argued thus, . . . if it were noticed not. His baptism was in fitting time design'd The Father said, and then dismiss'd it from his mind. 62 But the old Indian came again ere long With the same tale, and freely then confest His doubt that he had done Yeruti wrong; For something more than common seem'd imprest; And now he thought that certes it were best From the youth's lips his own account to hear, Haply the Father then to his request Might yield, regarding his desire sincere, Nor wait for farther time if there were aught to fear. 63 Considerately the Jesuit heard, and bade The youth be called. Yeruti told his tale. Nightly these blessed spirits came, he said, To warn him he must come within the pale Of Christ without delay; nor must he fail This warning to their Pastor to repeat, Till the renewed entreaty should prevail. Life's business then for him would be complete, And 'twas to tell him this they left their starry seat. 64 Came they to him in dreams? . . . he could not tell. Sleeping or waking now small difference made; For even while he slept he knew full well That his dear Mother and that darling Maid Both in the Garden of the Dead were laid: And yet he saw them as in life, the same, Save only that in radiant robes array'd, And round about their presence when they came There shone an effluent light as of a harmless flame. 65 And where he was he knew, the time, the place, . . . All circumstantial things to him were clear. His own heart undisturb'd. His Mother's face How could he choose but know; or knowing, fear Her presence and that Maid's, to him more dear Than all that had been left him now below? Their love had drawn them from their happy sphere; That dearest love unchanged they came to show; And he must be baptized, and then he too might go. 66 With searching ken the Jesuit while he spake Perused him, if in countenance or tone Aught might be found appearing to partake Of madness. Mark of passion there was none; None of derangement: in his eye alone, As from a hidden fountain emanate, Something of an unusual brightness shone: But neither word nor look betrayed a state Of wandering, and his speech, though earnest, was sedate. 67 Regular his pulse, from all disorder free, The vital powers perform'd their part assign'd; And to whate'er was ask'd, collectedly He answer'd. Nothing troubled him in mind; Why should it? Were not all around him kind? Did not all love him with a love sincere, And seem in serving him a joy to find? He had no want, no pain, no grief, no fear; But he must be baptized; he could not tarry here. 68 Thy will be done, Father in heaven who art! The Pastor said, nor longer now denied; But with a weight of awe upon his heart Enter'd the church, and there the font beside, With holy water, chrism and salt applied, Perform'd in all solemnity the rite. His feeling was that hour with fear allied; Yeruti's was a sense of pure delight, And while he knelt his eyes seem'd larger and more bright. 69 His wish hath been obtain'd, and this being done His soul was to its full desire content. The day in its accustom'd course pass'd on, The Indian mark'd him ere to rest he went, How o'er his beads, as he was wont, he bent, And then, like one who casts all care aside, Lay down. The old man fear'd no ill event, When, “Ye are come for me!” Yeruti cried; “Yes, I am ready now!” and instantly he died. TO CAROLINE BOWLES. Could I look forward to a distant day With hope of building some elaborate lay, Then would I wait till worthier strains of mine Might bear inscribed thy name, O Caroline! For I would, while my voice is heard on earth, Bear witness to thy genius and thy worth. But we have both been taught to feel with fear How frail the tenure of existence here, What unforeseen calamities prevent, Alas, how oft! the best resolved intent; And therefore this poor volume I address To thee, dear friend, and sister Poetess. robert southey. Keswick, 21 Feb. 1829. ALL FOR LOVE, OR A SINNER WELL SAVED. [A Youth hath enter'd the Sorcerer's door] I. A Youth hath enter'd the Sorcerer's door, But he dares not lift his eye, For his knees fail and his flesh quakes, And his heart beats audibly. “Look up, young man!” the Sorcerer said, “Lay open thy wishes to me! Or art thou too modest to tell thy tale? If so, . . I can tell it thee. “Thy name is Eleëmon; Proterius's freedman thou art; And on Cyra, thy Master's daughter, Thou hast madly fix'd thy heart. “But fearing (as thou well mayest fear!) The high-born Maid to woo, Thou hast tried what secret prayers and vows And sacrifice might do. “Thou hast prayed unto all Saints in Heaven, And to Mary their vaunted Queen; And little furtherance hast thou found From them, or from her, I ween! “And thou, I know, the Ancient Gods, In hope forlorn hast tried, If haply Venus might obtain The maiden for thy bride. “On Jove and Phœbus thou hast call'd, And on Astarte's name; And on her, who still at Ephesus Retains a faded fame. “Thy voice to Baal hath been raised; To Nile's old Deities; And to all Gods of elder time Adored by men in every clime When they ruled earth, seas and skies. “Their Images are deaf! Their Oracles are dumb! And therefore thou, in thy despair, To Abibas art come. “Ay, because neither Saints nor Gods Thy pleasure will fulfil, Thou comest to me, Eleëmon, To ask if Satan will! “I answer thee, Yes. But a faint heart Can never accomplish its ends; Put thy trust boldly in him, and be sure He never forsakes his friends.” While Eleëmon listen'd He shudder'd inwardly, At the ugly voice of Abibas, And the look in his wicked eye. And he could then almost have given His fatal purpose o'er; But his Good Angel had left him, When he entered the Sorcerer's door. So in the strength of evil shame, His mind the young man knit Into a desperate resolve, For his bad purpose fit. “Let thy Master give me what I seek, O Servant of Satan,” he said, “As I ask firmly, and for his Renounce all other aid! “Time presses. Cyra is content To bid the world farewell, And pass her days, a virgin vow'd, Among Emmelia's sisterhood, The tenant of a cell. “Thus hath her Father will'd, that so A life of rigour here below May fit her for the skies; And Heaven acceptably receive His costliest sacrifice. “The admiring people say of this That Angels, or that Saints in bliss, The holy thought inspire; And she is call'd a blessed Maid, And he a happy Sire. “Through Cappadocia far and wide The news hath found its way, And crowds to Cæsarea flock To attend the solemn day. “The robes are ready, rich with gold, Even like a bridal dress, Which at the altar she will wear When self-devoted she stands there In all her loveliness. “And that coarse habit too, which she Must then put on, is made, Therein to be for life and death Unchangeably array'd. “This night, . . this precious night is ours, . . Late, late, I come to you; But all that must be dared, or done, Prepared to dare and do.” “Thou hast hesitated long!” said Abibas, “And thou hast done amiss, In praying to Him whom I name not, That it never might come to this! “But thou hast chosen thy part, and here thou art; And thou shalt have thy desire; And tho' at the eleventh hour Thou hast come to serve our Prince of Power, He will give thee in full thine hire. “These Tablets take;” (he wrote as he spake,) “My letters, which thou art to bear, Wherein I shall commend thee To the Prince of the Powers of the Air. “Go from the North Gate out, and take On a Pagan's tomb thy stand; And, looking to the North, hold up The Tablets in thy hand; “And call the Spirits of the Air, That they my messenger may bear To the place whither he would pass, And there present him to their Prince In the name of Abibas. “The passage will be swift and safe, No danger awaits thee beyond; Thou wilt only have now to sign and seal, And hereafter to pay the Bond.” II. Shunning human sight, like a thief in the night, Eleëmon made no delay, But went unto a Pagan's tomb Beside the public way. Inclosed with barren elms it stood, There planted when the dead Within the last abode of man Had been deposited. And thrice ten years those barren trees, Enjoying light and air, Had grown and flourish'd, while the dead In darkness moulder'd there. Long had they overtopt the tomb; And closed was now that upper room Where friends were wont to pour, Upon the honour'd dust below, Libations thro' the floor. There on that unblest monument The young man took his stand, And northward he the tablets held In his uplifted hand. A courage not his own he felt, A wicked fortitude, Wherewith bad influences unseen That hour his heart endued. The rising Moon grew pale in heaven At that unhappy sight; And all the blessed Stars seem'd then To close their twinkling light; And a shuddering in the elms was heard, Tho' winds were still that night. He call'd the Spirits of the Air, He call'd them in the name Of Abibas; and at the call The attendant Spirits came. A strong hand which he could not see Took his uplifted hand; He felt a strong arm circle him, And lift him from his stand; A whirr of unseen wings he heard About him every where, Which onward with a mighty force, Impell'd him through the air. Fast through the middle sky and far It hurried him along, The Hurrican is not so swift, The Torrent not so strong; The Lightning travels not so fast, The Sunbeams not so far; And now behind him he hath left The Moon and every Star. And still erect as on the tomb In impious act he stood, Is he rapt onward . . . onward . . . still In that fix'd attitude. But as he from the living world Approach'd where Spirits dwell, His bearers there in thinner air Were dimly visible; Shapeless, and scarce to be descried In darkness where they flew; But still as they advanced, the more And more distinct they grew: And when their way fast-speeding they Thro' their own region went, Then were they in their substance seen, The angelic form, the fiendish mien, Face, look and lineament. Behold where dawns before them now, Far off, the boreal ray, Sole daylight of that frozen zone, The limit of their way. In that drear realm of outer night, Like the shadow, or the ghost of light, It moved in the restless skies, And went and came, like a feeble flame That flickers before it dies. There the fallen Seraph reign'd supreme Amid the utter waste; There on the everlasting ice His dolorous throne was placed. Son of the Morning! is it then For this that thou hast given Thy seat, pre-eminent among The hierarchies of Heaven? As if dominion here could joy To blasted pride impart; Or this cold region slake the fire Of Hell within the heart! Thither the Evil Angels bear The youth, and rendering homage there Their service they evince, And in the name of Abibas Present him to their Prince: Just as they seized him when he made The Sorcerer's mandate known, In that same act and attitude They set him before the throne. The fallen Seraph cast on him A dark disdainful look; And from his raised hand scornfully The proffer'd tablets took. “Ay, . . love!” he cried. “It serves me well. There was the Trojan boy, . . His love brought forth a ten years' war, And fired the towers of Troy. “And when my own Mark Antony Against young Cæsar strove, And Rome's whole world was set in arms, The cause was, . . all for love! “Some for ambition sell themselves, By avarice some are driven; Pride, envy, hatred, best will move Some souls, and some for only love Renounce their hopes of Heaven. “Yes, of all human follies, love, Methinks, hath served me best; The Apple had done but little for me If Eve had not done the rest. “Well then, young Amorist, whom love Hath brought unto this pass, I am willing to perform the word Of my servant Abibas. “Thy Master's daughter shall be thine, And with her sire's consent; And not more to thy heart's desire Than to her own content. “Yea, more; . . I give thee with the girl, Thine after-days to bless, Health, wealth, long life, and whatsoe'er The world calls happiness. “But, mark me! . . on conditions, youth! No paltering here we know! Dost thou here, solemnly, this hour Thy hope of Heaven forego? “Dost thou renounce thy baptism, And bind thyself to me, My woeful portion to partake Through all eternity? “No lurking purpose shall avail, When youth may fail and courage quail, To cheat me by contrition! I will have thee written down among The children of Perdition. “Remember, I deceive thee not, Nor have I tempted thee! Thou comest of thine own accord, And actest knowingly. “Dost thou, who now to choose art free, For ever pledge thyself to me? As I shall help thee, say!” . . . “I do; so help me, Satan!” said The wilful castaway. “A resolute answer,” quoth the Fiend; “And now then, Child of Dust, In farther proof of that firm heart, Thou wilt sign a Bond before we part, For I take thee not on trust!” Swift as thought a scroll and a reed were brought, And to Eleëmon's breast, Just where the heart-stroke plays, the point Of the reed was gently prest. It pierced not in, nor touch'd the skin; But the sense that it caused was such, As when an electric pellet of light Comes forcibly out at a touch; A sense no sooner felt than gone, But with that short feeling then A drop of his heart's-blood came forth And fill'd the fatal pen. And with that pen accurst, he sign'd The execrable scroll, Whereby he to perdition bound His miserable soul. “Eleëmon, Eleëmon!” then said the Demon, “The girl shall be thine, By the tie she holds divine, Till time that tie shall sever; And by this writing thou art mine, For ever, and ever, and ever!” III. Look at yon silent dwelling now! A heavenly sight is there, Where Cyra in her Chamber kneels Before the Cross in prayer. She is not loth to leave the world; For she hath been taught with joy To think that prayer and praise thenceforth Will be her life's employ. And thus her mind hath she inclined, Her pleasure being still, (An only child and motherless,) To do her Father's will. The moonlight falls upon her face, Upraised in fervour meek, While peaceful tears of piety Are stealing down her cheek. That duty done, the harmless maid Disposed herself to rest; No sin, no sorrow in her soul, No trouble in her breast. But when upon the pillow then, Composed, she laid her head, She little thought what unseen Powers Kept watch beside her bed. A double ward had she that night, When evil near her drew; Her own Good Angel guarding her, And Eleëmon's too. Their charge it was to keep her safe From all unholy things; And o'er her while she slept, they spread The shadow of their wings. So when an Evil Dream drew nigh They barr'd him from access, Nor suffer'd him to reach her with A breath of sinfulness. But with his instigations they A hallowing influence blent, And made his fiendish ministry Subserve to their intent. Thus while in troubled sleep she lay, Strange impulses were given, Emotions earthly and of earth, With heavenly ones of Heaven. And now the nightingale hath ceased Her strain, who all night long Hath in the garden rosier trill'd A rich and rapturous song. The storks on roof and dome and tower Forbear their clattering din, As now the motions and the sounds Of daily life begin. Then as from dreams that seem'd no dreams The wondering Maid awoke, A low sweet voice was in her ear; Such as we might expect to hear If some Good Angel spoke. According with her dreams, it said, “So, Cyra, must it be; The duties of a wedded life Hath Heaven ordain'd for thee.” This was no dream full well she knew; For open-eyed she lay, Conscious of thought and wakefulness, And in the light of day; And twice it spake, if doubt had been, To do all doubt away. Alas! but how shall she make known This late and sudden change? Or how obtain belief for what Even to herself is strange? How will her Father brook a turn That must to all seem shame? How bear to think that vulgar tongues Are busy with her name? That she should for a voice, . . a dream, . . Expose herself to be the theme Of wonder and of scorn; . . Public as her intent had been, And this the appointed morn! The Nuns even now are all alert; The altar hath been drest, The scissars that should clip her hair Provided, and the black hood there, And there the sable vest. And there the Priests are robing now; The Singers in their station; Hark! in the city she can hear The stir of expectation! Thro' every gate the people pour, And guests on roof and porch and tower Expectant take their place; The streets are swarming, and the church Already fills apace. Speak, then, she must: her heart she felt This night had changed its choice; Nor dared the Maiden disobey, . . Nor did she wish to (sooth to say), . . That sweet and welcome voice. Her Father comes: she studies not For gloss, or for pretence; The plain straight course will Cyra take, (Which none without remorse forsake,) Of truth and innocence. “O Father, hear me patiently!” The blushing Maiden said; “I tremble, Father, while I speak, But surely not for dread; “If all my wishes have till now Found favour in thy sight, And ever to perform thy will Hath been my best delight, Why should I fear to tell thee now The visions of this night? “I stood in a dream at the altar, . . But it was as an earthly Bride; And Eleëmon thy freedman Was the Bridegroom at my side. “Thou, Father, gavest me to him, With thy free and full consent; And, . . why should I dissemble it? . . Methought I was content. “Months then and years were crowded In the course of that busy night; I claspt a baby to my breart, And, oh! with what delight! “Yea, I was fruitful as a vine; Our heavenly Parent me and mine In all things seem'd to bless; Our ways were ways of peace, our paths Were paths of pleasantness. “When I taught lisping lips to pray The joy it was to me, O Father, thus to train these plants For immortality! “I saw their little winning ways Their grandsire's love engage; Methought they were the pride, the joy, The crown of his old age. “When from the Vision I awoke, A voice was in my ear, . . A waking voice, . . I heard it twice; No human tongue was near; “No human utterance so could reach The secret soul, no human speech So make the soul rejoice; In hearing it I felt and knew It was an Angel's voice! “And thus in words distinct it said, ‘So, Cyra, must it be! The duties of a wedded life Hath Heaven ordain'd for thee.’” Her cheek was like the new-blown rose, While thus she told her tale; Proterius listened earnestly, And as he heard grew pale. For he, too, in the dreams of night, At the altar had seem'd to stand, And to Eleëmon his freedman Had given his daughter's hand. Their offspring, courting his caress, About his knees had throng'd; A lovely progeny, in whom, When he was in the silent tomb, His line should be prolong'd. And he had heard a waking voice, Which said it so must be, Pronouncing upon Cyra's name A holiest eulogy: “Her shall her husband praise, and her Her children blest shall call; Many daughters have done virtuously, But thine excelleth them all!” No marvel if his heart were moved; The dream he saw was one; He kiss'd his trembling child, and said, “The will of Heaven be done!” Little did child or sire in this The work of sorcery fear; As little did Eleëmon think That the hand of Heaven was here. IV. From house to house, from street to street The rapid rumour flies; Incredulous ears it found, and hands Are lifted in surprise; And tongues through all the astonish'd town Are busier now than eyes. “So sudden and so strange a change! A Freedman, too, the choice! The shame, . . the scandal, . . and for what? A vision and a voice! “Had she not chosen the strait gate, . . The narrow way, . . the holy state, . . The Sanctuary's abode? Would Heaven call back its votary To the broad and beaten road? “To carnal wishes would it turn The mortified intent? For this are miracles vouchsafed? For this are Angels sent? “A plain collusion! a device Between the girl and youth! Good easy man must the Father be, To take such tale for truth!” So judged the acrid and the austere, And they whose evil heart Inclines them, in whate'er betides, To take the evil part. But others, whom a kindlier frame To better thoughts inclined, Preserved, amid their wonderment, An equitable mind. They would not of Proterius thus Injuriously misdeem, . . A grave good man, and with the wise For wisdom in esteem. No easy ear, or vain belief, Would he to falsehood lend; Nor ever might light motive him From well-weigh'd purpose bend. And surely on his pious child, The gentle Cyra, meek and mild, Could no suspicion rest; For in this daughter he had been Above all fathers blest. As dutiful as beautiful, Her praise was widely known, Being one who, as she grew in years, Had still in goodness grown. And what though Eleëmon were A man of lowly birth? Enough it was if Nature had Ennobled him with worth. “This was no doubtful thing,” they said, “For he had in the house been bred, Nor e'er from thence removed; But there from childhood had been known, And trusted and approved. “Such as he was his qualities Might to the world excuse The Maid and Father for their choice, Without the vision and the voice, Had they been free to choose. “But Heaven by miracle had made Its pleasure manifest; That manifested will must set All doubtful thoughts to rest. Mysterious tho' they be, the ways Of Providence are best.” The wondering City thus discoursed; To Abibas alone The secret truth, and even to him But half the truth, was known. Meantime the Church hath been prepared For spousal celebration; The Sisters to their cells retire, Amazed at such mutation. The habit and hood of camel's hair, Which with the sacred scissars there On the altar were display'd, Are taken thence, and in their stead The marriage rings are laid. Behold, in garments gay with gold, For other spousals wrought, The Maiden from her Father's house With bridal pomp is brought. And now before the Holy Door In the Ante-nave they stand; The Bride and Bridegroom side by side, The Paranymphs in festal pride Arranged on either hand. Then from the Sanctuary the Priests, With incense burning sweet, Advance, and at the Holy Door The Bride and Bridegroom meet. There to the Bride and Bridegroom they The marriage tapers gave; And to the altar as they go, With cross-way movement to and fro, The thuribule they wave. For fruitfulness, and perfect love, And constant peace, they pray'd, On Eleëmon, the Lord's Servant, And Cyra, the Lord's Handmaid. They call'd upon the Lord to bless Their spousal celebration, And sanctify the marriage rite To both their souls' salvation. A pause at every prayer they made, Whereat with one accord The Choristers took up their part, And sung in tones that thrill'd the heart, Have mercy on us, Lord! Then with the marriage rings the priest Betroth'd them each to each, And, as the sacred pledge was given, Resumed his aweful speech; Pronouncing them before high Heaven This hour espoused to be, Now and for ever more, for time And for eternity. This did he in the presence Of Angels and of men; And at every pause the Choristers Intoned their deep Amen! Then to that gracious Lord, the Priest His supplication made, Who, as our sacred Scriptures tell, Did bring Rebecca to the well When Abraham's servant pray'd. He call'd upon that gracious Lord To stablish with his power The espousals made between them, In truth and love, this hour; And with his mercy and his word Their lot, now link'd, to bless, And let his Angel guide them In the way of righteousness. With a Christian benediction, The Priest dismist them then, And the Choristers, with louder voice, Intoned the last Amen! The days of Espousals are over; And on the Crowning-day, To the sacred fane the bridal train, A gay procession, take again Thro' thronging streets their way. Before them, by the Paranymphs, The coronals are borne, Composed of all sweet flowers of spring By virgin hands that morn. With lighted tapers in array They enter the Holy Door, And the Priest with the waving thuribule Perfumes the way before. He raised his voice, and call'd aloud On Him who from the side Of our first Father, while he slept, Form'd Eve to be his bride; Creating Woman thus for Man A helpmate meet to be, For youth and age, for good and ill, For weal and woe, united still In strict society, Flesh of his flesh; appointing them One flesh to be, one heart; Whom God hath joined together, Them let not man dispart! And on our Lord he call'd, by whom The marriage feast was blest, When first by miracle he made His glory manifest. Then in the ever-blessed Name, Almighty over all, From the man's Paranymph he took The marriage coronal; And crowning him therewith, in that Thrice holy Name, he said, “Eleëmon, the Servant of God, is crown'd For Cyra, the Lord's Handmaid!” Next, with like action and like words, Upon her brow he set Her coronal, intwined wherein The rose and lily met; How beautifully they beseem'd Her locks of glossy jet! Her he for Eleëmon crown'd, The Servant of the Lord; . . Alas, how little did that name With his true state accord! “Crown them with honour, Lord!” he said, “With blessings crown the righteous head! To them let peace be given, A holy life, a hopeful end, A heavenly crown in Heaven!” Still as he made each separate prayer For blessings that they in life might share, And for their eternal bliss, The echoing Choristers replied, “O Lord, so grant thou this!” How differently meantime, before The altar as they knelt, While they the sacred rites partake Which endless matrimony make, The Bride and Bridegroom felt! She, who possest her soul in peace And thoughtful happiness, With her whole heart had inly join'd In each devout address. His lips the while had only moved In hollow repetition; For he had steel'd himself, like one Bound over to perdition. In present joy he wrapt his heart, And resolutely cast All other thoughts beside him, Of the future, or the past. V. Twelve years have held their quiet course Since Cyra's nuptial day; How happily, how rapidly, Those years have past away! Blest in her husband she hath been; He loved her as sincerely, (Most sinful and unhappy man!) As he had bought her dearly. She hath been fruitful as a vine, And in her children blest; Sorrow hath not come near her yet, Nor fears to shake, nor cares to fret, Nor grief to wound the breast. And blest alike would her husband be, Were all things as they seem; Eleëmon hath every earthly good, And with every man's esteem. But where the accursed reed had drawn The heart-blood from his breast, A small red spot remain'd Indelibly imprest. Nor could he from his heart throw off The consciousness of his state; It was there with a dull, uneasy sense, A coldness and a weight; It was there when he lay down at night, It was there when at morn he rose; He feels it whatever he does, It is with him wherever he goes. No occupation from his mind That constant sense can keep; It is present in his waking hours, It is present in his sleep; But still he felt it most, And with painfullest weight it prest, . . O miserable man! When he was happiest. O miserable man, Who hath all the world to friend, Yet dares not in prosperity Remember his latter end! But happy man, whate'er His earthly lot may be, Who looks on Death as the Angel That shall set his spirit free, And bear it to its heritage Of immortality! In such faith hath Proterius lived; And strong is that faith and fresh, As if obtaining then new power, When he hath reach'd the awful hour Appointed for all flesh. Eleëmon and his daughter With his latest breath he blest, And saying to them, “We shall meet Again before the Mercy-seat!” Went peacefully to rest. This is the balm which God Hath given for every grief; And Cyra, in her anguish, Look'd heavenward for relief. But her miserable husband Heard a voice within him say, Eleëmon, Eleëmon, Thou art sold to the Demon!” And his heart seem'd dying away. Whole Cæsarea is pour'd forth To see the funeral state, When Proterius is borne to his resting place Without the Northern Gate. Not like a Pagan's is his bier At doleful midnight borne By ghastly torchlight, and with wail Of women hired to mourn. With tapers in the face of day, These rites their faithful hope display; In long procession slow, With hymns that fortify the heart, And prayers that soften woe. In honour of the dead man's rank, But of his virtues more, The holy Bishop Basil Was one the bier who bore. And with the Bishop side by side, As nearest to the dead allied, Was Eleëmon seen: All mark'd, but none could rede aright, The trouble in his mien. “His master's benefits on him Were well bestow'd,” they said, “Whose sorrow now full plainly show'd How well he loved the dead.” They little ween'd what thoughts in him The solemn psalm awoke, Which to all other hearts that hour Its surest comfort spoke: “Gather my Saints together: In peace let them be laid, They who with me,” thus saith the Lord, “Their covenant have made!” What pangs to Eleëmon then, O wretchedest of wretched men, That psalmody convey'd! For conscience told him that he too A covenant had made. And when he would have closed his ears Against the unwelcome word, Then from some elms beside the way A Raven's croak was heard. To him it seem'd a hollow voice That warn'd him of his doom; For the tree whereon the Raven sate Grew over the Pagan's tomb. VI. When weariness would let her No longer pray and weep, And midnight long was past, Then Cyra fell asleep. Into that wretched sleep she sunk Which only sorrow knows, Wherein the exhausted body rests, But the heart hath no repose. Of her Father she was dreaming, Still aware that he was dead, When, in the visions of the night, He stood beside her bed. Crown'd and in robes of light he came; She saw he had found grace; And yet there seem'd to be A trouble in his face. The eye and look were still the same That she from her cradle knew; And he put forth his hand, and blest her, As he had been wont to do. But then the smile benign Of love forsook his face, And a sorrowful displeasure Came darkly in its place; And he cast on Eleëmon A melancholy eye, And sternly said, “I bless thee not, . . Bondsman! thou knowest why!” Again to Cyra then he turn'd, “Let not thy husband rest, Till he hath wash'd away with tears The red spot from his breast! “Hold fast thy hope, and Heaven will not Forsake thee in thine hour: Good Angels will be near thee, And evil ones shall fear thee, And Faith will give thee power.” Perturb'd, yet comforted, she woke, For in her waking ear The words were heard which promised her A strength above all fear. An odour, that refresh'd no less Her spirit with its blessedness Than her corporeal frame, Was breathed around, and she surely found That from Paradise it came. And, though the form revered was gone, A clear unearthly light Remain'd, encompassing the bed, When all around was night. It narrow'd as she gazed; And soon she saw it rest, Concenter'd, like an eye of light, Upon her husband's breast. Not doubting now the presence Of some good presiding Power, Collectedness as well as strength Was given her in this hour. And rising half, the while in deep But troubled sleep he lay, She drew the covering from his breast With cautious hand away. The small round blood-red mark she saw; Eleëmon felt her not; But in his sleep he groan'd, and cried “Out! out . . . accursed spot!” The darkness of surrounding night Closed then upon that eye of light. She waited for the break Of day, and lay the while in prayer For that poor sinner's sake . . . In fearful, miserable prayer; But while she pray'd the load of care Less heavily bore on her heart, And light was given, enabling her To choose her difficult part. And she drew, as comfortable texts Unto her thoughts recurr'd, Refreshment from the living well Of God's unerring word. But when the earliest dawn appear'd, Herself in haste she array'd, And watch'd his waking patiently, And still as she watched she pray'd; And when Eleëmon had risen, She spake to him, and said: “We have been visited this night! My Father's Ghost I have seen; I heard his voice, . . an aweful voice! . . And so hast thou, I ween!” Eleëmon was pale when he awoke; But paler then he grew, And over his whole countenance There came a deathlike hue. Still he controll'd himself, and sought Her question to beguile; And forcing, while he answer'd her, A faint and hollow smile, . . “Cyra,” he said, “thy thoughts possest With one too painful theme, Their own imaginations For reality misdeem; Let not my dearest best beloved, Be troubled for a Dream!” “O Eleëmon,” she replied, “Dissemble not with me thus; Ill it becomes me to forget What Dreams have been to us! “Thinkest thou there can be peace for me, Near to me as thou art, While some unknown and fearful sin Is festering at thy heart? “Eleëmon, Eleëmon, I may not let thee rest, Till thou hast wash'd away with tears The red spot from thy breast! “Thus to conceal thy crime from me, It is no tenderness! The worst is better known than fear'd. Whatever it be, confess; And the Merciful will cleanse thee From all unrighteousness!” Like an aspen leaf he trembled; And his imploring eye Bespake compassion, ere his lips Could utter their dreaded reply. “O dearly loved, as dearly bought, My sin and punishment I had thought To bear through life alone; Too much the Vision hath reveal'd, And all must now be known! “On thee, methinks, and only thee Dare I for pity call; Abhor me not, . . . renounce me not, . . My life, my love, my all! “And Cyra, sure if ever cause Might be a sinner's plea, 'Twould be for that lost wretch who sold His hope of Heaven for thee! “Thou seest a miserable man Given over to despair, Who has bound himself by his act and deed To the Prince of the Powers of the Air.” She seized him by the arm, And hurrying him into the street, “Come with me to the Church,” she cried, “And to Basil the Bishop's feet!” VII. Public must be the sinner's shame As heinous his offence; So Basil said, when he ordain'd His form of penitence. And never had such dismay been felt Thro' that astonish'd town, As when, at morn, the Cryer went Proclaiming up and down, “The miserable sinner, Eleëmon, Who for love hath sold himself to the Demon, His guilt before God and man declares; And beseeches all good Christians To aid him with their prayers.” Many were the hearts compassionate Whom that woeful petition moved; For he had borne his fortune meekly, And therefore was well beloved. Open his hand had been, And liberal of its store; And the prayers of the needy arose Who had daily been fed at his door. They too whom Cyra's secret aid Relieved from pressing cares, In this her day of wretchedness, Repaid her with their prayers. And from many a gentle bosom Supplications for mercy were sent, If haply they might aid The wretched penitent. Sorely such aid he needed then! Basil himself, of living men The powerfullest in prayer, For pity, rather than in hope, Had bidden him not despair. So hard a thing for him it seem'd To wrest from Satan's hand The fatal Bond, which, while retain'd, Must against him in judgement stand. “Dost thou believe,” he said, “that Grace Itself can reach this grief?” With a feeble voice, and a woeful eye, “Lord, I believe!” was the sinner's reply, “Help thou mine unbelief!” The Bishop then crost him on the brow, And crost him on the breast: And told him if he did his part With true remorse and faithful heart, God's mercy might do the rest. “Alone in the holy Relic-room Must thou pass day and night, And wage with thy ghostly enemies A more than mortal fight. “The trial may be long, and the struggle strong, Yet be not thou dismay'd; For thou mayest count on Saints in Heaven, And on earthly prayers for aid. “And in thy mind this scripture bear With steadfast faithfulness, whate'er To appall thee may arrive; ‘When the wicked man turneth away from his sin He shall save his soul alive!’ “Take courage as thou lookest around On the relics of the blest; And night and day, continue to pray, Until thy tears have wash'd away The stigma from thy breast!” “Let me be with him!” Cyra cried; “If thou mayest not be there, In this sore trial I at least My faithful part may bear: “My presence may some comfort prove, Yea, haply some defence; O Father, in myself I feel The strength of innocence!” “Nay, Daughter, nay; it must not be! Tho' dutiful this desire; He may, by Heaven's good grace, be saved, But only as if by fire; “Sights which should never meet thine eye Before him may appear; And fiendish voices proffer words Which should never assail thy ear; Alone must he this trance sustain; Keep thou thy vigils here!” He led him to the Relic-room; Alone he left him there; And Cyra with the Nuns remain'd To pass her time in prayer. Alone was Eleëmon left For mercy on Heaven to call; Deep and unceasing were his prayers, But not a tear would fall. His lips were parch'd, his head was hot, His eyeballs throbb'd with heat; And in that utter silence He could hear his temples beat. But cold his feet, and cold his hands; And at his heart there lay An icy coldness unrelieved, While he pray'd the livelong day. A long, long day! It past away In dreadful expectation; Yet free throughout the day was he From outward molestation. Nor sight appear'd, nor voice was heard, Tho' every moment both he fear'd; The Spirits of the Air Were busy the while in infusing Suggestions of despair. And he in strong endeavour still Against them strove with earnest will; Heart-piercing was his cry, Heart-breathed his groaning; but it seem'd That the source of tears was dry. And now had evening closed; The dim lamp-light alone On the stone cross, and the marble walls, And the shrines of the Martyrs, shone. Before the Cross Eleëmon lay: His knees were on the ground; Courage enough to touch the Cross Itself, he had not found. But on the steps of the pedestal His lifted hands were laid; And in that lowliest attitude The suffering sinner pray'd. A strong temptation of the Fiend, Which bade him despair and die, He with the aid of Scripture Had faithfully put by; And then, as with a dawning hope, He raised this contrite cry: “Oh that mine eyes were fountains! If the good grace of Heaven Would give me tears, methinks I then Might hope to be forgiven!” To that meek prayer a short loud laugh From fiendish lips replied: Close at his ear he felt it, And it sounded on every side. From the four walls and the vaulted roof A shout of mockery rung; And the echoing ground repeated the sound, Which peal'd above, and below, and around, From many a fiendish tongue. The lamps went out at that hideous shout, But darkness had there no place, For the room was fill'd with a lurid light That came from a Demon's face. A dreadful face it was, . . too well By Eleëmon known! Alas! he had seen it when he stood Before the dolorous Throne. “Eleëmon! Eleëmon!” Sternly said the Demon, “How have I merited this? I kept my covenant with thee, And placed thee in worldly bliss! “And still thou mightest have had, Thine after-days to bless, Health, wealth, long life, and whatsoe'er The World calls happiness. “Fool, to forego thine earthly joys, Who hast no hope beyond! For judgement must be given for me, When I sue thee upon the Bond. “Remember I deceived thee not; Nor had I tempted thee; Thou camest of thine own accord, And didst act knowingly! “I told thee thou might'st vainly think To cheat me by contrition, When thou wert written down among The Children of Perdition! “‘So help me, Satan!’ were thy words When thou didst this allow; I help'd thee, Eleëmon, then, . . And I will have thee now!” At the words of the Fiend, from the floor Eleëmon in agony sprung; Up the steps of the pedestal he ran, And to the Cross he clung. And then it seem'd as if he drew, While he claspt the senseless stone, A strength he had not felt till then, A hope he had not known. So when the Demon ceased, He answer'd him not a word; But looking upward, he His faithful prayer preferr'd: “All, all, to Thee, my Lord And Saviour, I confess! And I know that Thou canst cleanse me From all unrighteousness! “I have turned away from my sin, In Thee do I put my trust, To such Thou hast promised forgiveness, And Thou art faithful and just!” With that the Demon disappear'd, The lamps resumed their light; Nor voice, nor vision more Disturb'd him thro' the night. He stirr'd not from his station, But there stood fix'd in prayer; And when Basil the Bishop enter'd At morn, he found him there. VIII. Well might the Bishop see what he Had undergone that night; Remorse and agony of mind Had made his dark hair white. So should the inner change, he ween'd, With the outward sign accord; And holy Basil crost himself, And blest our gracious Lord. “Well hast thou done,” said he, “my son, And faithfully fought the fight; So shall this day complete, I trust, The victory of the night. “I fear'd that forty days and nights Too little all might be; But great and strange hath been the change One night hath wrought in thee.” “O Father, Father!” he replied, “And hath it been but one? An endless time it seem'd to me! I almost thought Eternity With me had been begun. “And surely this poor flesh and blood Such terrors could not have withstood, If grace had not been given; But when I claspt the blessed Cross, I then had help from Heaven. “The coldness from my heart is gone; But still the weight is there, And thoughts which I abhor, will come And tempt me to despair. “Those thoughts I constantly repel; And all, methinks, might yet be well, Could I but weep once more, And with true tears of penitence My dreadful state deplore. “Tears are denied; their source is dried! And must it still be so? O Thou, who from a rock didst make The living waters flow, “A broken and a bleeding heart This hour I offer Thee; And, when Thou seest good, my tears Shall then again be free!” A knocking at the door was heard As he ended this reply; Hearing that unexpected sound, The Bishop turn'd his eye, And his venerable Mother, Emmelia the Abbess, drew nigh. “We have not ceased this mournful night,” Said she, “on Heaven to call; And our afflicted Cyra Hath edified us all. “More fervent prayers from suffering heart, I ween, have ne'er been sent; And now she asks, as some relief, In this her overwhelming grief, To see the penitent. “So earnestly she ask'd, that I Her wish would not defer; And I have brought her to the door, Forgive me, Son, if I err.” “Hard were I did I not consent To thy compassionate intent, O Mother,” he replied; And raising then his voice, “Come in, Thou innocent!” he cried. That welcome word when Cyra heard, With a sad pace and slow, Forward she came, like one whose heart Was overcharged with woe. Her face was pale, . . long illness would Have changed those features less; And long-continued tears had dimm'd Her eyes with heaviness. Her husband's words had reach'd her ear When at the door she stood; “Thou hast pray'd in vain for tears,” she said, “While I have pour'd a flood! “Mine flow, and they will flow; they must; They cannot be represt! And oh that they might wash away The stigma from thy breast! “Oh that these tears might cleanse that spot, . . Tears which I cannot check!” Profusely weeping as she spake, She fell upon his neck. He clasp'd the mourner close, and in That passionate embrace, In grief for her, almost forgot His own tremendous case. Warm as they fell he felt her tears, And in true sympathy, So gracious Heaven permitted then, His own to flow were free. And then the weight was taken off, Which at his heart had prest; . . O mercy! and the crimson spot Hath vanish'd from his breast! At that most happy sight, The four with one accord Fell on their knees, and blest The mercy of the Lord. “What then! before the strife is done Would ye of victory boast?” Said a Voice above: “they reckon too soon, Who reckon without their host!” “Mine is he by a Bond Which holds him fast in law: I drew it myself for certainty, And sharper than me must the Lawyer be Who in it can find a flaw! “Before the Congregation, And in the face of day, Whoever may pray, and whoever gainsay, I will challenge him for my Bondsman, And carry him quick away!” “Ha, Satan! dost thou in thy pride,” With righteous anger Basil cried, “Defy the force of prayer? In the face of the Church wilt thou brave it? Why then we will meet thee there! “There mayest thou set forth thy right, With all thy might before the sight Of all the Congregation: And they that hour shall see the power Of the Lord unto salvation!” “A challenge fair! We meet then there,” Rejoin'd the Prince of the Powers of the Air; “The Bondsman is mine by right. Let the whole city come at thy call: And great and small, in face of them all, I will have him in thy despite!” So having said, he tarried not To hear the Saint's reply. “Beneath the sign which Constantine,” Said Basil, “beheld in the sky, We strive, and have our strength therein, Therein our victory!” IX. The Church is fill'd, so great the faith That City in its Bishop hath; And now the Congregation Are waiting there in trembling prayer And terrible expectation. Emmelia and her sisterhood Have taken there their seat; And Choristers and Monks and Priests And Psalmists there, and Exorcists, Are station'd in order meet. In sackcloth clad, with ashes strewn Upon his whiter hair, Before the steps of the altar, His feet for penance bare, Eleëmon stands, a spectacle For men and Angels there. Beside him Cyra stood, in weal Or woe, in good or ill, Not to be sever'd from his side, His faithful helpmate still. Dishevell'd were her raven locks, As one in mourner's guise; And pale she was, but faith and hope Had now relumed her eyes. At the altar Basil took his stand; He held the Gospel in his hand, And in his ardent eye Sure trust was seen, and conscious power, And strength for victory. At his command the Chorister Enounced the Prophet's song, “To God our Saviour mercies And forgivenesses belong.” Ten thousand voices join'd to raise The holy hymn on high, And hearts were thrill'd and eyes were fill'd By that full harmony. And when they ceased, and Basil's hand A warning signal gave, The whole huge multitude was hush'd In a stillness like that of the grave. The Sun was high in a bright blue sky, But a chill came over the crowd, And the Church was suddenly darken'd, As if by a passing cloud. A sound as of a tempest rose, Though the day was calm and clear; Intrepid must the heart have been Which did not then feel fear. In the sound of the storm came the dreadful Form; The Church then darken'd more, And He was seen erect on the screen Over the Holy Door. Day-light had sicken'd at his sight; And the gloomy Presence threw A shade profound over all around, Like a cheerless twilight hue. “I come hither,” said the Demon, “For my Bondsman Eleëmon! Mine is he, body and soul. See all men!” and with that on high He held the open scroll. The fatal signature appear'd To all the multitude, Distinct as when the accursed pen Had traced it with fresh blood. “See all men!” Satan cried again, And then his claim pursued. “I ask for justice! I prefer An equitable suit! I appeal to the Law, and the case Admitteth of no dispute. “If there be justice here, If Law have place in Heaven, A ward upon this Bond Must then for me be given. “What to my rightful claim, Basil, canst thou gainsay, That I should not seize the Bondsman, And carry him quick away? “The writing is confess'd; . . No plea against it shown; . . The forfeiture is mine, And now I take my own!” “Hold there!” cried Basil, with a voice That arrested him on his way, When from the screen he would have swoopt To pounce upon his prey; “Hold there, I say! Thou canst not sue Upon this Bond by law! A sorry legalist were he Who could not in thy boasted plea Detect its fatal flaw. “The Deed is null, for it was framed With fraudulent intent; A thing unlawful in itself; A wicked instrument, . . . Not to be pleaded in the Courts . . . Sir Fiend, thy cause is shent! “This were enough; but, more than this, A maxim, as thou knowest, it is Whereof all Laws partake, That no one may of his own wrong His own advantage make. “The man, thou sayest, thy Bondsman is; Mark now, how stands the fact! Thou hast allow'd, . . nay, aided him As a Freedman to contract A marriage with this Christian woman here, And by a public act. “That act being publicly perform'd With thy full cognizance, Claim to him as thy Bondsman thou Canst never more advance. “For when they solemnly were then United, in sight of Angels and men, The matrimonial band Gave to the wife a right in him; And we on this might stand. “Thy claim upon the man was by Thy silence then forsaken; A marriage thus by thee procured May not by thee be shaken; And thou, O Satan, as thou seest, In thine own snare art taken!” So Basil said, and paused awhile; The Arch-Fiend answer'd not; But he heaved in vexation A sulphurous sigh for the Bishop's vocation, And thus to himself he thought; “The Law thy calling ought to have been, With thy wit so ready, and tongue so free! To prove by reason in reason's despite, That right is wrong, and wrong is right, And white is black, and black is white, . . What a loss have I had in thee!” “I rest not here,” the Saint pursued; “Tho' thou in this mayest see, That in the meshes of thine own net I could entangle thee! “Fiend, thou thyself didst bring about The spousal celebration, Which link'd them by the nuptial tie For both their souls' salvation. “Thou sufferedst them before high Heaven With solemn rights espoused to be, Then and for evermore, for time And for eternity. “That tie holds good; those rites Will reach their whole intent; And thou of his salvation wert Thyself the instrument. “And now, methinks, thou seest in this A higher power than thine; And that thy ways were overruled, To work the will divine!” With rising energy he spake, And more majestic look; And with authoritative hand Held forth the Sacred Book. Then with a voice of power he said, “The Bond is null and void! It is nullified, as thou knowest well, By a Covenant whose strength by Hell Can never be destroy'd! “The Covenant of grace, That greatest work of Heaven, Which whoso claims in perfect faith, His sins shall be forgiven. “Were they as scarlet red They should be white as wool; This is the All-mighty's Covenant, Who is All-merciful! “His Minister am I! In his All-mighty name To this repentant sinner God's pardon I proclaim! “In token that against his soul The sin shall no longer stand, The writing is effaced, which there Thou holdest in thy hand! “Angels that are in bliss above This triumph of Redeeming Love Will witness, and rejoice; And ye shall now in thunder hear Heaven's ratifying voice!” A peal of thunder shook the pile; The Church was fill'd with light, And when the flash was past, the Fiend Had vanish'd from their sight. He fled as he came, but in anger and shame; The pardon was complete, And the impious scroll was dropt, a blank, At Eleëmon's feet. THE PILGRIM TO COMPOSTELLA: BEING THE LEGEND OF A COCK AND A HEN, TO THE HONOUR AND GLORY OF SANTIAGO. A CHRISTMAS TALE. “Res similis fictæ; sed quid mihi fingere prodest.” Ovid, Met. xiii. v. 935. “Hear also no lean story of theirs!”—Lightfoot. PRELUDE. “Tell us a story, old Robin Gray! This merry Christmas time; We are all in our glory, so tell us a story, Either in prose, or in rhyme. “Open your budget, old Robin Gray! We very well know it is full; Come! out with a murder, . . a Goblin, . . a Ghost, Or a tale of a Cock and a Bull!” “I have no tale of a Cock and a Bull, My good little women and men; But 'twill do as well, perhaps, if I tell A tale of a Cock and a Hen.” INTRODUCTION. You have all of you heard of St. James for Spain As one of the Champions Seven, Who, having been good Knights on Earth, Became Hermits, and Saints in Heaven. Their history once was in good repute, And so it ought to be still; Little friends, I dare say you have read it: And if not, why I hope you will. Of this St. James that book proclaims Great actions manifold, But more amazing are the things Which of him in Spain are told. How once a ship of marble made, Came sailing o'er the sea, Wherein his headless corpse was laid, Perfumed with sanctity. And how, though then he had no head, He afterwards had two; Which both work'd miracles so well, That it was not possible to tell The false one from the true. Whereby, my little friends, we see That an original may sometimes be No better than its fac-simile; A useful truth I trow, Which picture-buyers won't believe, But which picture-dealers know. Young Connoisseurs who will be! Remember I say this, . . For your benefit hereafter, . . In a parenthesis. And not to interrupt The order of narration, This warning shall be printed By way of annotation. And how he used to fight the Moors Upon a milk-white charger: Large tales of him the Spaniards tell, Munchausen tells no larger. But in their cause of latter years He has not been so hearty; For that he never struck a stroke is plain, When our Duke, in many a hard campaign, Beat the French armies out of Spain, And conquer'd Buonaparte. Yet still they worship him in Spain, And believe in him with might and main: Santiago there they call him; And if any one there should doubt these tales, They've an Inquisition to maul him. At Compostella in his Church His body and one head Have been for some eight hundred years By Pilgrims visited. Old scores might there be clean rubb'd off, And tickets there were given To clear all toll gates on the way Between the Churchyard and Heaven. Some went for payment of a vow In time of trouble made; And some who found that pilgrimage Was a pleasant sort of trade. And some, I trow, because it was Believed, as well as said, That all, who in their mortal stage Did not perform this pilgrimage, Must make it when they were dead. Some upon penance for their sins, In person, or by attorney; And some who were, or had been sick; And some who thought to cheat Old Nick; And some who liked the journey: Which well they might when ways were safe; And therefore rich and poor Went in that age on pilgrimage, As folks now make a tour. The poor with scrip, the rich with purse, They took their chance for better for worse, From many a foreign land, With a scallop-shell in the hat for badge, And a Pilgrim's staff in hand. Something there is, the which to leave Untold would not be well, Relating to the Pilgrim's staff, And to the scallop-shell. For the scallop shows in a coat of arms, That of the bearer's line Some one, in former days, hath been To Santiago's shrine. And the staff was bored and drilled for those Who on a flute could play, And thus the merry Pilgrim had His music on the way. THE LEGEND. PART I. Once on a time three Pilgrims true, Being Father and Mother and Son, For pure devotion to the Saint, This pilgrimage begun. Their names, little friends, I am sorry to say, In none of my books can I find; But the son, if you please, we'll call Pierre, What the parents were call'd, never mind. From France they came, in which fair land They were people of good renown; And they took up their lodging one night on the way In La Calzada town. Now, if poor Pilgrims they had been, And had lodged in the Hospice instead of the Inn, My good little women and men, Why then you never would have heard, This tale of the Cock and the Hen. For the Innkeepers they had a daughter, Sad to say, who was just such another, As Potiphar's daughter, I think, would have been If she follow'd the ways of her mother. This wicked woman to our Pierre Behaved like Potiphar's wife; And, because she fail'd to win his love, She resolved to take his life. So she pack'd up a silver cup In his wallet privily; And then, as soon as they were gone, She raised a hue and cry. The Pilgrims were overtaken, The people gather'd round, Their wallets were search'd, and in Pierre's The silver cup was found. They dragg'd him before the Alcayde; A hasty Judge was he, “The theft,” he said, “was plain and proved, And hang'd the thief must be.” So to the gallows our poor Pierre Was hurried instantly. If I should now relate The piteous lamentation, Which for their son these parents made, My little friends, I am afraid You'd weep at the relation. But Pierre in Santiago still His constant faith profess'd; When to the gallows he was led, “'Twas a short way to Heaven,” he said, “Though not the pleasantest.” And from their pilgrimage he charged His parents not to cease, Saying that unless they promised this, He could not be hang'd in peace. They promised it with heavy hearts; Pierre then, therewith content, Was hang'd: and they upon their way To Compostella went. PART II. Four weeks they travell'd painfully, They paid their vows, and then To La Calzada's fatal town Did they come back again. The Mother would not be withheld, But go she must to see Where her poor Pierre was left to hang Upon the gallows tree. Oh tale most marvellous to hear, Most maryellous to tell! Eight weeks had he been hanging there, And yet was alive and well! “Mother,” said he, “I am glad you're return'd, It is time I should now be released: Though I cannot complain that I'm tired, And my neck does not ache in the least. “The Sun has not scorch'd me by day, The Moon has not chill'd me by night; And the winds have but help'd me to swing, As if in a dream of delight. “Go you to the Alcayde, That hasty Judge unjust, Tell him Santiago has saved me, And take me down he must!” Now, you must know the Alcayde, Not thinking himself a great sinner, Just then at table had sate down, About to begin his dinner. His knife was raised to carve, The dish before him then; Two roasted fowls were laid therein, That very morning they had been A Cock and his faithful Hen. In came the Mother wild with joy; “A miracle!” she cried; But that most hasty Judge unjust Repell'd her in his pride. “Think not,” quoth he, “to tales like this That I should give belief! Santiago never would bestow His miracles, full well I know, On a Frenchman and a thief.” And pointing to the Fowls, o'er which He held his ready knife, “As easily might I believe These birds should come to life!” The good Saint would not let him thus The Mother's true tale withstand; So up rose the Fowls in the dish, And down dropt the knife from his hand. The Cock would have crow'd if he could; To cackle the Hen had a wish; And they both slipt about in the gravy Before they got out of the dish. And when each would have open'd its eyes, For the purpose of looking about them, They saw they had no eyes to open, And that there was no seeing without them. All this was to them a great wonder; They stagger'd and reel'd on the table; And either to guess where they were, Or what was their plight, or how they came there, Alas! they were wholly unable: Because, you must know, that that morning, A thing which they thought very hard, The Cook had cut off their heads, And thrown them away in the yard. The Hen would have prank'd up her feathers, But plucking had sadly deform'd her; And for want of them she would have shiver'd with cold, If the roasting she had had not warm'd her. And the Cock felt exceedingly queer; He thought it a very odd thing That his head and his voice were he did not know where, And his gizzard tuck'd under his wing. The gizzard got into its place, But how Santiago knows best: And so, by the help of the Saint, Did the liver and all the rest. The heads saw their way to the bodies, In they came from the yard without check, And each took its own proper station, To the very great joy of the neck. And in flew the feathers, like snow in a shower, For they all became white on the way; And the Cock and the Hen in a trice were refledged, And then who so happy as they! Cluck! cluck! cried the Hen right merrily then, The Cock his clarion blew, Full glad was he to hear again His own cock-a-doo-del-doo! PART III. “A miracle!” a miracle!” The people shouted, as they might well, When the news went through the town; And every child and woman and man Took up the cry, and away they ran To see Pierre taken down. They made a famous procession; My good little women and men, Such a sight was never seen before, And I think will never again. Santiago's Image, large as life, Went first with banners and drum and fife; And next, as was most meet, The twice-born Cock and Hen were borne Along the thronging street. Perch'd on a cross-pole hoisted high, They were raised in sight of the crowd; And, when the people set up a cry, The Hen she cluck'd in sympathy, And the Cock he crow'd aloud. And because they very well knew for why They were carried in such solemnity, And saw the Saint and his banners before 'em, They behaved with the greatest propriety, And most correct decorum. The Knife, which had cut off their heads that morn, Still red with their innocent blood, was borne, The scullion boy he carried it; And the Skewers also made a part of the show, With which they were truss'd for the spit. The Cook in triumph bore that Spit As high as he was able; And the Dish was display'd wherein they were laid When they had been served at table. With eager faith the crowd prest round; There was a scramble of women and men For who should dip a finger-tip In the blessed Gravy then. Next went the Alcayde, beating his breast, Crying aloud like a man distrest, And amazed at the loss of his dinner, “Santiago, Santiago! Have mercy on me a sinner!” And lifting oftentimes his hands Towards the Cock and Hen, “Orate pro nobis!” devoutly he cried, And as devoutly the people replied, Whenever he said it, “Amen!” The Father and Mother were last in the train; Rejoicingly they came, And extoll'd, with tears of gratitude, Santiago's glorious name. So, with all honours that might be, They gently unhang'd Pierre; No hurt or harm had he sustain'd, But, to make the wonder clear, A deep black halter-mark remain'd Just under his left ear. PART IV. And now, my little listening dears With open mouths and open ears, Like a rhymer whose only art is That of telling a plain unvarnish'd tale, To let you know I must not fail, What became of all the parties. Pierre went on to Compostella To finish his pilgrimage, His parents went back with him joyfully, After which they returned to their own country; And there, I believe, that all the three Lived to a good old age. For the gallows on which Pierre So happily had swung, It was resolved that never more On it should man be hung. To the Church it was transplanted, As ancient books declare: And the people in commotion, With an uproar of devotion, Set it up for a relic there. What became of the halter I know not, Because the old books show not; But we may suppose and hope, That the city presented Pierre With that interesting rope. For in his family, and this The Corporation knew, It rightly would be valued more Than any cordon bleu. The Innkeeper's wicked daughter Confess'd what she had done, So they put her in a Convent, And she was made a Nun. The Alcayde had been so frighten'd That he never ate fowls again; And he always pull'd off his hat When he saw a Cock and Hen. Wherever he sat at table Not an egg might there be placed; And he never even muster'd courage for a custard, Though garlic tempted him to taste Of an omelet now and then. But always after such a transgression He hasten'd away to make confession; And not till he had confess'd, And the Priest had absolved him, did he feel His conscience and stomach at rest. The twice-born Birds to the Pilgrim's Church, As by miracle consecrated, Were given; and there unto the Saint They were publicly dedicated. At their dedication the Corporation A fund for their keep supplied; And after following the Saint and his banners, This Cock and Hen were so changed in their manners, That the Priests were edified. Gentle as any turtle-dove, Saint Cock became all meekness and love; Most dutiful of wives, Saint Hen she never peck'd again, So they led happy lives. The ways of ordinary fowls You must know they had clean forsaken; And if every Cock and Hen in Spain Had their example taken, Why then . . . the Spaniards would have had No eggs to eat with bacon. These blessed Fowls, at seven years end, In the odour of sanctity died; They were carefully pluck'd, and then They were buried, side by side. And lest the fact should be forgotten, (Which would have been a pity,) 'Twas decreed, in honour of their worth, That a Cock and Hen should be borne thenceforth In the arms of that ancient City. Two eggs Saint Hen had laid, no more; The chicken were her delight; A Cock and Hen they proved, And both, like their parents, were virtuous and white. The last act of the Holy Hen Was to rear this precious brood; and, when Saint Cock and she were dead, This couple, as the lawful heirs, Succeeded in their stead. They also lived seven years, And they laid eggs but two, From which two milk-white chicken To Cock and Henhood grew; And always their posterity The self-same course pursue. Not one of these eggs ever addled, (With wonder be it spoken!) Not one of them ever was lost, Not one of them ever was broken. Sacred they are; neither magpie, nor rat, Snake, weasel, nor marten approaching them: And woe to the irreverent wretch Who should even dream of poaching them! Thus then is this great miracle Continued to this day; And to their Church all Pilgrims go, When they are on the way; And some of the feathers are given them; For which they always pay. No price is set upon them, And this leaves all persons at ease; The Poor give as much as they can, The Rich as much as they please. But that the more they give the better, Is very well understood; Seeing whatever is thus disposed of, Is for their own souls' good; For Santiago will always Befriend his true believers; And the money is for him, the Priests Being only his receivers. To make the miracle the more, Of these feathers there is always store, And all are genuine too; All of the original Cock and Hen, Which the Priests will swear is true. Thousands a thousand times told have bought them, And if myriads and tens of myriads sought them, They would still find some to buy; For however great were the demand, So great would be the supply. And if any of you, my small friends, Should visit those parts, I dare say You will bring away some of the feathers, And think of old Robin Gray.</field>

I. THE FUNERAL. 1. Midnight, and yet no eye Through all the Imperial City closed in sleep! Behold her streets a-blaze With light that seems to kindle the red sky, Her myriads swarming through the crowded ways! Master and slave, old age and infancy, All, all abroad to gaze; House-top and balcony Clustered with women, who throw back their veils With unimpeded and insatiate sight To view the funeral pomp which passes by, As if the mournful rite Were but to them a scene of joyance and delight. 2. Vainly, ye blessed twinklers of the night, Your feeble beams ye shed, Quench'd in the unnatural light which might out-stare Even the broad eye of day; And thou from thy celestial way Pourest, O Moon, an ineffectual ray! For lo! ten thousand torches flame and flare Upon the midnight air, Blotting the lights of heaven With one portentous glare. Behold the fragrant smoke in many a fold Ascending, floats along the fiery sky, And hangeth visible on high, A dark and waving canopy. 3. Hark! 'tis the funeral trumpet's breath! 'Tis the dirge of death! At once ten thousand drums begin, With one long thunder-peal the ear assailing; Ten thousand voices then join in, And with one deep and general din Pour their wild wailing. The song of praise is drown'd Amid the deafening sound; You hear no more the trumpet's tone, You hear no more the mourner's moan, Though the trumpet's breath, and the dirge of death, Swell with commingled force the funeral yell. But rising over all in one acclaim Is heard the echoed and re-echoed name, From all that countless rout; Arvalan! Arvalan! Arvalan! Arvalan! Ten times ten thousand voices in one shout Call Aryalan! The overpowering sound, From house to house repeated rings about, From tower to tower rolls round. 4. The death-procession moves along; Their bald heads shining to the torches' ray, The Bramins lead the way, Chaunting the funeral song. And now at once they shout, Arvalan! Arvalan! With quick rebound of sound, All in accordant cry, Arvalan! Arvalan! The universal multitude reply. In vain ye thunder on his ear the name; Would ye awake the dead? Borne upright in his palankeen, There Arvalan is seen! A glow is on his face, . . . a lively red; It is the crimson canopy Which o'er his cheek a reddening shade hath shed; He moves, . . . he nods his head, . . . But the motion comes from the bearers' tread, As the body, borne aloft in state, Sways with the impulse of its own dead weight. 5. Close following his dead son, Kehama came, Nor joining in the ritual song, Nor calling the dear name; With head deprest, and funeral vest, And arms enfolded on his breast, Silent and lost in thought he moves along. King of the World, his slaves unenvying now Behold their wretched Lord; rejoiced they see The mighty Rajah's misery; That Nature in his pride hath dealt the blow, And taught the Master of Mankind to know Even he himself is man, and not exempt from woe. 6. O sight of grief! the wives of Arvalan, Young Azla, young Nealliny, are seen! Their widow-robes of white, With gold and jewels bright, Each like an Eastern queen. Woe! woe! around their palankeen, As on a bridal day, With symphony, and dance, and song, Their kindred and their friends come on. The dance of sacrifice! the funeral song! And next the victim slaves in long array, Richly bedight to grace the fatal day, Move onward to their death; The clarions' stirring breath Lifts their thin robes in every flowing fold, And swells the woven gold, That on the agitated air Flutters and glitters to the torch's glare. 7. A man and maid of aspect wan and wild, Then, side by side, by bowmen guarded, came; O wretched father! O unhappy child! Them were all eyes of all the throng exploring... Is this the daring man Who raised his fatal hand at Arvalan? Is this the wretch condemn'd to feel Kehama's dreadful wrath? Then were all hearts of all the throng deploring; For not in that innumerable throng Was one who loved the dead; for who could know What aggravated wrong Provoked the desperate blow! 8. Far, far behind, beyond all reach of sight, In order'd files the torches flow along, One ever-lengthening line of gliding light: Far... far behind, Rolls on the undistinguishable clamour, Of horn, and trump, and tambour; Incessant as the roar Of streams which down the wintry mountain pour, And louder than the dread commotion Of breakers on a rocky shore, When the winds rage over the waves, And Ocean to the Tempest raves. 9. And now toward the bank they go, Where winding on their way below, Deep and strong the waters flow. Here doth the funeral pile appear With myrrh and ambergris bestrew'd, And built of precious sandal wood. They cease their music and their outcry here, Gently they rest the bier; They wet the face of Arvalan, No sign of life the sprinkled drops excite; They feel his breast, . . . no motion there; They feel his lips, . . . no breath; For not with feeble, nor with erring hand, The brave avenger dealt the blow of death. Then with a doubling peal and deeper blast, The tambours and the trumpets sound on high, And with a last and loudest cry They call on Arvalan. 10. Woe! woe! for Azla takes her seat Upon the funeral pile! Calmly she took her seat, Calmly the whole terrific pomp survey'd; As on her lap the while The lifeless head of Arvalan was laid. 11. Woe! woe! Nealliny, The young Nealliny! They strip her ornaments away, Bracelet and anklet, ring, and chain, and zone; Around her neck they leave The marriage knot alone, . . . That marriage band, which when Yon waning moon was young, Around her virgin neck With bridal joy was hung. Then with white flowers, the coronal of death, Her jetty locks they crown. 12. O sight of misery! You cannot hear her cries, . . . their sound In that wild dissonance is drown'd; . . . But in her face you see The supplication and the agony, . . . See in her swelling throat the desperate strength That with vain effort struggles yet for life; Her arms contracted now in fruitless strife, Now wildly at full length Towards the crowd in vain for pity spread, . . . They force her on, they bind her to the dead. 13. Then all around retire; Circling the pile, the ministring Bramins stand, Each lifting in his hand a torch on fire. Alone the Father of the dead advanced And lit the funeral pyre. 14. At once on every side The circling torches drop, At once on every side The fragrant oil is pour'd, At once on every side The rapid flames rush up. Then hand in hand the victim band Roll in the dance around the funeral pyre; Their garments flying folds Float inward to the fire; In drunken whirl they wheel around; One drops, . . . another plunges in; And still with overwhelming din The tambours and the trumpets sound; And clap of hand, and shouts, and cries, From all the multitude arise; While round and round, in giddy wheel, Intoxicate they roll and reel, Till one by one whirl'd in they fall, And the devouring flames have swallow'd all. 15. Then all was still; the drums and clarions ceased; The multitude were hush'd in silent awe; Only the roaring of the flames was heard. II. THE CURSE. 1. Alone towards the Table of the Dead Kehama moved; there on the altar-stone Honey and rice he spread. There with collected voice and painful tone He call'd upon his son. Lo! Arvalan appears; Only Kehama's powerful eye beheld The thin etherial spirit hovering nigh; Only the Rajah's ear Receiv'd his feeble breath. And is this all? the mournful Spirit said, This all that thou canst give me after death? This unavailing pomp, These empty pageantries that mock the dead! 2. In bitterness the Rajah heard, And groan'd, and smote his breast, and o'er his face Cowl'd the white mourning vest. 3.ARVALAN. Art thou not powerful, . . . even like a God? And must I, through my years of wandering, Shivering and naked to the elements, In wretchedness await The hour of Yamen's wrath? I thought thou wouldst embody me anew, Undying as I am, . . . Yea, re-create me! . . . Father, is this all? This all? and thou Almighty! 4. But in that wrongful and upbraiding tone, Kehama found relief, For rising anger half supprest his grief. Reproach not me! he cried, Had I not spell-secur'd thee from disease, Fire, sword, . . . all common accidents of man, . . . And thou! . . . fool, fool... to perish by a stake! And by a peasant's arm! . . . Even now, when from reluctant Heaven, Forcing new gifts and mightier attributes, So soon I should have quell'd the Death-God's power. 5. Waste not thy wrath on me, quoth Arvalan, It was my hour of folly! Fate prevail'd, Nor boots it to reproach me that I fell. I am in misery, Father! Other souls Predoom'd to Indra's Heaven, enjoy the dawn Of bliss, . . . to them the temper'd elements Minister joy: genial delight the sun Sheds on their happy being, and the stars Effuse on them benignant influences; And thus o'er earth and air they roam at will, And when the number of their days is full, Go fearlessly before the aweful throne. But I, . . . all naked feeling and raw life, . . . What worse than this hath Yamen's hell in store? If ever thou didst love me, mercy father! Save me, for thou canst save... the Elements Know and obey thy voice. 6. KEHAMA. The Elements Shall sin no more against thee; whilst I speak Already dost thou feel their power is gone. Fear not! I cannot call again the past, Fate hath made that its own; but Fate shall yield To me the future; and thy doom be fix'd By mine, not Yamen's will. Meantime all power Whereof thy feeble spirit can be made Participant, I give. Is there aught else To mitigate thy lot? ARVALAN. Only the sight of vengeance. Give me that! Vengeance, full, worthy, vengeance! . . . not the stroke Of sudden punishment, . . . no agony That spends itself and leaves the wretch at rest, But lasting long revenge. KEHAMA. What, boy? is that cup sweet? then take thy fill! 7. So as he spake, a glow of dreadful pride Inflamed his cheek, with quick and angry stride He moved toward the pile, And raised his hand to hush the crowd, and cried, Bring forth the murderer! At the Rajah's voice, Calmly, and like a man whom fear had stunn'd, Ladurlad came, obedient to the call; But Kailyal started at the sound, And gave a womanly shriek, and back she drew, And eagerly she roll'd her eyes around, As if to seek for aid, albeit she knew No aid could there be found. 8. It chanced that near her on the river-brink, The sculptured form of Marriataly stood; It was an Idol roughly hewn of wood, Artless, and mean, and rude; The Goddess of the poor was she; None else regarded her with piety. But when that holy Image Kailyal view'd, To that she sprung, to that she clung, On her own Goddess with close-clasping arms, For life the maiden hung. 9. They seized the maid; with unrelenting grasp They bruised her tender limbs; She, nothing yielding, to this only hope Clings with the strength of frenzy and despair She screams not now, she breathes not now, She sends not up one vow, She forms not in her soul one secret prayer, All thought, all feeling, and all powers of life In the one effort centering. Wrathful they With tug and strain would force the maid away; . . . Didst thou, O Marriataly, see their strife, In pity didst thou see the suffering maid? Or was thine anger kindled, that rude hands Assail'd thy holy Image? . . . for behold The holy image shakes! 10. Irreverently bold, they deem the maid Relax'd her stubborn hold, And now with force redoubled drag their prey; And now the rooted Idol to their sway Bends, . . . yields, . . . and now it falls. But then they scream, For lo! they feel the crumbling bank give way, And all are plunged into the stream. 11. She hath escaped my will, Kehama cried, She hath escaped, . . . but thou art here, I have thee still, The worser criminal! And on Ladurlad, while he spake, severe He fix'd his dreadful frown. The strong reflection of the pile Lit his dark lineaments, Lit the protruded brow, the gathered front, The steady eye of wrath. 12. But while the fearful silence yet endured, Ladurlad roused himself; Ere yet the voice of destiny Which trembled on the Rajah's lips was loosed Eager he interposed, As if despair had waken'd him to hope; Mercy! oh mercy! only in defence... Only instinctively, . . . Only to save my child, I smote the Prince; King of the world, be merciful! Crush me, . . . but torture not! 13. The Man-Almighty deign'd him no reply, Still he stood silent; in no human mood Of mercy, in no hesitating thought Of right and justice. At the length he raised His brow yet unrelax'd, . . . his lips unclosed, And uttered from the heart, With the whole feeling of his soul enforced, The gathered vengeance came. 14. I charm thy life From the weapons of strife, From stone and from wood, From fire and from flood, From the serpent's tooth, And the beasts of blood: From Sickness I charm thee, And Time shall not harm thee; But Earth which is mine, Its fruits shall deny thee; And Water shall hear me, And know thee and fly thee; And the Winds shall not touch thee When they pass by thee, And the Dews shall not wet thee, When they fall nigh thee: And thou shalt seek Death To release thee, in vain; Thou shalt live in thy pain, While Kehama shall reign, With a fire in thy heart, And a fire in thy brain; And Sleep shall obey me, And visit thee never, And the Curse shall be on thee For ever and ever. 15. There where the Curse had stricken him, There stood the miserable man, There stood Ladurlad, with loose-hanging arms, And eyes of idiot wandering. Was it a dream? alas, He heard the river flow, He heard the crumbling of the pile, He heard the wind which shower'd The thin white ashes round. There motionless he stood, As if he hoped it were a dream, And feared to move, lest he should prove The actual misery; And still at times he met Kehama's eye, Kehama's eye that fastened on him still. III. THE RECOVERY. 1. The Rajah turned toward the pile again, Loud rose the song of death from all the crowd; Their din the instruments begin, And once again join in With overwhelming sound. Ladurlad starts, . . . he looks around; What hast thou here in view, O wretched man! in this disastrous scene? The soldier train, the Bramins who renew Their ministry around the funeral pyre, The empty palankeens, The dimly-fading fire. 2. Where too is she whom most his heart held dear, His best-beloved Kailyal, where is she, The solace and the joy of many a year Of widowhood? is she then gone, And is he left all-utterly alone, To bear his blasting curse, and none To succour or deplore him? He staggers from the dreadful spot; the throng Give way in fear before him; Like one who carries pestilence about, Shuddering they shun him, where he moves along. And now he wanders on Beyond the noisy rout; He cannot fly and leave his Curse behind, Yet doth he seem to find A comfort in the change of circumstance. Adown the shore he strays, Unknowing where his wretched feet shall rest, But farthest from the fatal place is best. 3. By this in the orient sky appears the gleam Of day. Lo! what is yonder in the stream, Down the slow river floating slow, In distance indistinct and dimly seen? The childless one with idle eye Followed its motion thoughtlessly; Idly he gaz'd unknowing why, And half unconscious that he watch'd its way. Belike it is a tree Which some rude tempest, in its sudden sway, Tore from the rock, or from the hollow shore The undermining stream hath swept away. 4. But when anon outswelling by its side, A woman's robe he spied, Oh then Ladurlad started, As one, who in his grave Had heard an Angel's call. Yea, Marriataly, thou hast deign'd to save! Yea, Goddess! it is she, Kailyal, still clinging senselessly To thy dear Image, and in happy hour Upborne amid the wave By that preserving power. 5. Headlong in hope and in joy Ladurlad plunged in the water; The Water knew Kehama's spell, The Water shrunk before him. Blind to the miracle, He rushes to his daughter, And treads the river-depths in transport wild, And clasps and saves his child. 6. Upon the farther side a level shore Of sand was spread: thither Ladurlad bore His daughter, holding still with senseless hand The saving Goddess; there upon the sand He laid the livid maid, Raised up against his knees her drooping head; Bent to her lips, . . . her lips as pale as death, . . . If he might feel her breath, His own the while in hope and dread suspended; Chafed her cold breast, and ever and anon Let his hand rest, upon her heart extended. 7. Soon did his touch perceive, or fancy there, The first faint motion of returning life. He chafes her feet, and lays them bare In the sun; and now again upon her breast Lays his hot hand; and now her lips he prest, For now the stronger throb of life he knew; And her lips tremble too! The breath comes palpably: Her quivering lids unclose, Feebly and feebly fall, Relapsing as it seem'd to dead repose. 8. So in her father's arms thus languidly, While over her with earnest gaze he hung, Silent and motionless she lay, And painfully and slowly writhed at fits, At fits to short convulsive starts was stung. Till when the struggle and strong agony Had left her, quietly she lay reposed: Her eyes now resting on Ladurlad's face, Relapsing now, and now again unclosed. The look she fix'd upon his face, implies Nor thought nor feeling; senselessly she lies, Composed like one who sleeps with open eyes. 9. Long he leant over her, In silence and in fear. Kailyal! . . . at length he cried in such a tone As a poor mother ventures who draws near, With silent footstep, to her child's sick bed. My Father! cried the maid, and raised her head, Awakening then to life and thought, . . . thou here? For when his voice she heard, The dreadful past recurr'd, Which dimly, like a dream of pain, Till now with troubled sense confused her brain. 10. And hath he spared us then? she cried, Half rising as she spake, For hope and joy the sudden strength supplied; In mercy hath he curb'd his cruel will, That still thou livest? But as thus she said, Impatient of that look of hope, her sire Shook hastily his head; Oh! he hath laid a Curse upon my life, A clinging curse, quoth he; Hath sent a fire into my heart and brain, A burning fire, for ever there to be! The Winds of Heaven must never breathe on me; The Rains and Dews must never fall on me; Water must mock my thirst and shrink from me; The common Earth must yield no fruit to me; Sleep, blessed Sleep! must never light on me; And Death, who comes to all, must fly from me, And never, never set Ladurlad free. 11. This is a dream! exclaimed the incredulous maid, Yet in her voice the while a fear exprest, Which in her larger eye was manifest. This is a dream! she rose and laid her hand Upon her father's brow, to try the charm; He could not bear the pressure there; . . . he shrunk, . . . He warded off her arm, As though it were an enemy's blow, he smote His daughter's arm aside. Her eye glanced down, his mantle she espied And caught it up; . . . Oh misery! Kailyal cried, He bore me from the river-depths, and yet His garment is not wet! IV. THE DEPARTURE. 1. Reclined beneath a Cocoa's feathery shade Ladurlad lies, And Kailyal on his lap her head hath laid, To hide her streaming eyes. The boatman, sailing on his easy way, With envious eye beheld them where they lay; For every herb and flower Was fresh and fragrant with the early dew, Sweet sung the birds in that delicious hour, And the cool gale of morning as it blew, Not yet subdued by day's increasing power, Ruffling the surface of the silvery stream, Swept o'er the moisten'd sand, and raised no shower. Telling their tale of love, The boatman thought they lay At that lone hour, and who so blest as they! 2. But now the Sun in heaven is high, The little songsters of the sky Sit silent in the sultry hour, They pant and palpitate with heat; Their bills are open languidly To catch the passing air; They hear it not, they feel it not, It murmurs not, it moves not. The boatman, as he looks to land, Admires what men so mad to linger there, For yonder Cocoa's shade behind them falls, A single spot upon the burning sand. 3. There all the morning was Ladurlad laid, Silent and motionless, like one at ease; There motionless upon her father's knees Reclined the silent maid. The man was still, pondering with steady mind, As if it were another's Curse, His own portentous lot; Scanning it o'er and o'er in busy thought, As though it were a last night's tale of woe, Before the cottage door By some old beldam sung, While young and old, assembled round, Listened, as if by witchery bound, In fearful pleasure to her wonderous tongue. 4. Musing so long he lay, that all things seem Unreal to his sense, even like a dream, A monstrous dream of things which could not be. That beating, burning brow, . . . why it was now The height of noon, and he was lying there In the broad sun, all bare! What if he felt no wind? the air was still. That was the general will Of Nature, not his own peculiar doom; Yon rows of rice erect and silent stand, The shadow of the Cocoa's lightest plume Is steady on the sand. 5. Is it indeed a dream? he rose to try, Impatient to the water side he went, And down he bent, And in the stream he plunged his hasty arm To break the visionary charm. With fearful eye and fearful heart, His daughter watch'd the event; She saw the start and shudder, She heard the in-drawn groan, For the Water knew Kehama's charm, The Water shrunk before his arm. His dry hand moved about unmoisten'd there; As easily might that dry hand avail To stop the passing gale, Or grasp the impassive air. He is Almighty then! Exclaim'd the wretched man in his despair: Air knows him, Water knows him; Sleep His dreadful word will keep; Even in the grave there is no rest for me, Cut off from that last hope, . . . the wretch's joy; And Veeshnoo hath no power to save, Nor Seeva to destroy. 6. Oh! wrong not them! quoth Kailyal, Wrong not the Heavenly Powers! Our hope is all in them: They are not blind! And lighter wrongs than ours, And lighter crimes than his, Have drawn the Incarnate down among mankind. Already have the Immortals heard our cries, And in the mercy of their righteousness Beheld us in the hour of our distress! She spake with streaming eyes, Where pious love and ardent feeling beam. And turning to the Image, threw Her grateful arms around it, . . . It was thou Who savedst me from the stream! My Marriataly, it was thou! I had not else been here To share my Father's Curse, To suffer now, . . . and yet to thank thee thus! 7. Here then, the maiden cried, dear Father, here Raise our own Goddess, our divine Preserver! The mighty of the earth despise her rites, She loves the poor who serve her. Set up her Image here, With heart and voice the guardian Goddess bless, For jealously would she resent Neglect and thanklessness; . . . Set up her Image here, And bless her for her aid with tongue and soul sincere. 8. So saying on her knees the maid Began the pious toil. Soon their joint labour scoops the easy soil; They raise the Image up with reverent hand, And round its rooted base they heap the sand. O Thou whom we adore, O Marriataly, thee do I implore, The virgin cried; my Goddess, pardon thou The unwilling wrong, that I no more, With dance and song, Can do thy daily service, as of yore! The flowers which last I wreathed around thy brow, Are withering there; and never now Shall I at eve adore thee, And swimming round with arms outspread, Poise the full pitcher on my head, In dextrous dance before thee, While underneath the reedy shed, at rest My father sat the evening rites to view, And blest thy name, and blest His daughter too. 9. Then heaving from her heart a heavy sigh, O Goddess! from that happy home, cried she, The Almighty Man hath forced us! And homeward with the thought unconsciously She turn'd her dizzy eye.... But there on high, With many a dome, and pinnacle, and spire, The summits of the Golden Palaces Blazed in the dark blue sky, aloft, like fire. Father, away! she cried, away! Why linger we so nigh? For not to him hath Nature given The thousand eyes of Deity, Always and every where with open sight, To persecute our flight! Away... away! she said, And took her father's hand, and like a child He followed where she led. V. THE SEPARATION. 1. Evening comes on: arising from the stream, Homeward the tall flamingo wings his flight; And where he sails athwart the setting beam, His scarlet plumage glows with deeper light. The watchman, at the wish'd approach of night, Gladly forsakes the field, where he all day, To scare the winged plunderers from their prey, With shout and sling, on yonder clay-built height, Hath borne the sultry ray. Hark! at the Golden Palaces The Bramin strikes the hour. For leagues and leagues around, the brazen sound Rolls through the stillness of departing day, Like thunder far away. 2. Behold them wandering on their hopeless way, Unknowing where they stray, Yet sure where'er they stop to find no rest. The evening gale is blowing, It plays among the trees; Like plumes upon a warrior's crest, They see yon cocoas tossing to the breeze. Ladurlad views them with impatient mind, Impatiently he hears The gale of evening blowing, The sound of waters flowing, As if all sights and sounds combined To mock his irremediable woe; For not for him the blessed waters flow, For not for him the gales of evening blow, A fire is in his heart and brain, And Nature hath no healing for his pain. 3. The Moon is up, still pale Amid the lingering light. A cloud ascending in the eastern sky, Sails slowly o'er the vale, And darkens round and closes in the night. No hospitable house is nigh, No traveller's home the wanderers to invite; Forlorn, and with long watching overworn, The wretched father and the wretched child Lie down amid the wild. 4. Before them full in sight, A white flag flapping to the winds of night, Marks where the tyger seized a human prey. Far, far away with natural dread, Shunning the perilous spot, At other times abhorrent had they fled; But now they heed it not. Nothing they care; the boding death-flag now In vain for them may gleam and flutter there. Despair and agony in him, Prevent all other thought; And Kailyal hath no heart or sense for aught, Save her dear father's strange and miserable lot. 5. There in the woodland shade, Upon the lap of that unhappy maid, His head Ladurlad laid, And never word he spake; Nor heaved he one complaining sigh, Nor groaned he with his misery, But silently for her dear sake Endured the raging pain. And now the moon was hid on high, No stars were glimmering in the sky; She could not see her father's eye, How red with burning agony; Perhaps he may be cooler now, She hoped, and long'd to touch his brow With gentle hand, yet did not dare To lay the painful pressure there. Now forward from the tree she bent, And anxiously her head she leant, And listened to his breath. Ladurlad's breath was short and quick, Yet regular it came, And like the slumber of the sick, In pantings still the same Oh if he sleeps! . . . her lips unclose, Intently listening to the sound, That equal sound so like repose. Still quietly the sufferer lies, Bearing his torment now with resolute will; He neither moves, nor groans, nor sighs. Doth satiate cruelty bestow This little respite to his woe, She thought, or are there Gods who look below? 6. Perchance, thought Kailyal, willingly deceived, Our Marriataly hath his pain relieved, And she hath bade the blessed sleep assuage His agony, despite the Rajah's rage. That was a hope which fill'd her gushing eyes, And made her heart in silent yearnings rise, To bless the power divine in thankfulness. And yielding to that joyful thought her mind, Backward the maid her aching head reclined Against the tree, and to her father's breath In fear she hearken'd still with earnest ear. But soon forgetful fits the effort broke: In starts of recollection then she woke, Till now benignant Nature overcame The Virgin's weary and exhausted frame, Nor able more her painful watch to keep, She closed her heavy lids, and sunk to sleep. 7. Vain was her hope! he did not rest from pain, The Curse was burning in his brain; Alas! the innocent maiden thought he slept, But Sleep the Rajah's dread commandment kept, Sleep knew Kehama's Curse. The dews of night fell round them now, They never bathed Ladurlad's brow, They knew Kehama's Curse. The night-wind is abroad, Aloft it moves among the stirring trees; He only heard the breeze, . . . No healing aid to him it brought, It play'd around his head and touch'd him not, It knew Kehama's Curse. 8. Listening, Ladurlad lay in his despair, If Kailyal slept, for wherefore should she share Her father's wretchedness, which none could cure? Better alone to suffer; he must bear The burden of his Curse, but why endure The unavailing presence of her grief? She too, apart from him, might find relief; For dead the Rajah deem'd her, and as thus Already she his dread revenge had fled, So might she still escape and live secure. 9. Gently he lifts his head, And Kailyal does not feel; Gently he rises up, . . . she slumbers still; Gently he steals away with silent tread. Anon she started, for she felt him gone; She call'd, and through the stillness of the night, His step was heard in flight. Mistrustful for a moment of the sound, She listens; till the step is heard no more; But then she knows that he indeed is gone, And with a thrilling shriek she rushes on. The darkness and the wood impede her speed; She lifts her voice again, Ladurlad! . . . and again, alike in vain, And with a louder cry Straining its tone to hoarseness; . . . far away, Selfish in misery. He heard the call and faster did he fly. 10. She leans against that tree whose jutting bough Smote her so rudely. Her poor heart How audibly it panted, With sudden stop and start; Her breath how short and painfully it came! Hark! all is still around her, . . . And the night so utterly dark, She opened her eyes and she closed them, And the blackness and blank were the same. 11. 'Twas like a dream of horror, and she stood Half doubting whether all indeed were true. A tyger's howl loud echoing through the wood, Roused her; the dreadful sound she knew, And turn'd instinctively to what she fear'd. Far off the tyger's hungry howl was heard; A nearer horror met the maiden's view, For right before her a dim form appear'd, A human form in that black night, Distinctly shaped by its own lurid light, Such light as the sickly moon is seen to shed, Through spell-raised fogs, a bloody baleful red. 12. That Spectre fix'd his eyes upon her full; The light which shone in their accursed orbs Was like a light from Hell, And it grew deeper, kindling with the view. She could not turn her sight From that infernal gaze, which like a spell Bound her, and held her rooted to the ground. It palsied every power, Her limbs avail'd her not in that dread hour, There was no moving thence, Thought, memory, sense were gone: She heard not now the Tyger's nearer cry, She thought not on her father now, Her cold heart's-blood ran back, Her hand lay senseless on the bough it clasp'd, Her feet were motionless; Her fascinated eyes Like the stone eye-balls of a statue fix'd, Yet conscious of the sight that blasted them. 13. The wind is abroad, It opens the clouds; Scattered before the gale, They skurry through the sky, And the darkness retiring rolls over the vale. The Stars in their beauty come forth on high, And through the dark blue night The Moon rides on triumphant, broad and bright. Distinct and darkening in her light Appears that Spectre foul, The moon-beam gives his face and form to sight, The shape of man, The living form and face of Arvalan! . . . His hands are spread to clasp her. 14. But at that sight of dread the Maid awoke; As if a lightning-stroke Had burst the spell of fear, Away she broke all franticly, and fled. There stood a temple near beside the way, An open fane of Pollear, gentle God, To whom the travellers for protection pray. With elephantine head and eye severe, Here stood his image, such as when he seiz'd And tore the rebel Giant from the ground, With mighty trunk wreathed round His impotent bulk, and on his tusks, on high Impaled upheld him between earth and sky. 15. Thither the affrighted Maiden sped her flight, And she hath reach'd the place of sanctuary; And now within the temple in despite, Yea, even before the altar, in his sight, Hath Arvalan with fleshly arm of might Seized her. That instant the insulted God Caught him aloft, and from his sinuous grasp, As if from some tort catapult let loose, Over the forest hurl'd him all abroad. 16. O'ercome with dread, She tarried not to see what heavenly Power Had saved her in that hour; Breathless and faint she fled. And now her foot struck on the knotted root Of a broad manchineil, and there the Maid Fell senselessly beneath the deadly shade. VI. CASYAPA. 1. Shall this then be thy fate, O lovely Maid, Thus, Kailyal, must thy sorrows then be ended? Her face upon the ground, Her arms at length extended, There like a corpse behold her laid Beneath the deadly shade. What if the hungry Tyger, prowling by, Should snuff his banquet nigh? Alas, Death needs not now his ministry; The baleful boughs hang o'er her, The poison-dews descend. What Power will now restore her? What God will be her friend? 2. Bright and so beautiful was that fair night, It might have calm'd the gay amid their mirth, And given the wretched a delight in tears. One of the Glendoveers, The loveliest race of all of heavenly birth, Hovering with gentle motion o'er the earth, Amid the moonlight air, In sportive flight was floating round and round, Unknowing where his joyous way was tending. He saw the Maid where motionless she lay, And stoopt his flight descending, And raised her from the ground. Her heavy eye-lids are half closed, Her cheeks are pale and livid like the dead, Down hang her loose arms lifelessly, Down hangs her languid head. 3. With timely pity touch'd for one so fair, The gentle Glendoveer Press'd her thus pale and senseless to his breast, And springs aloft in air with sinewy wings, And bears the Maiden there, Where Himakoot, the holy Mount, on high From mid-earth rising in mid-Heaven, Shines in its glory like the throne of Even. Soaring with strenuous flight above, He bears her to the blessed Grove, Where in his ancient and august abodes, There dwells old Casyapa, the Sire of Gods. 4. The Father of the Immortals sate, Where underneath the Tree of Life, The Fountains of the Sacred River sprung; The Father of the Immortals smiled Benignant on his son. Knowest thou, he said, my child, Ereenia, knowest thou whom thou bringest here, A mortal to the holy atmosphere? EREENIA. I found her in the Groves of Earth, Beneath a poison-tree, Thus lifeless as thou seest her. In pity have I brought her to these bowers, Not erring, Father! by that smile... By that benignant eye! CASYAPA. What if the Maid be sinful? if her ways Were ways of darkness, and her death predoom'd To that black hour of midnight, when the Moon Hath turn'd her face away, Unwilling to behold The unhappy end of guilt? EREENIA. Then what a lie, my Sire, were written here, In these fair characters! and she had died, Sure proof of purer life and happier doom, Now in the moonlight, in the eye of Heaven, If I had left so fair a flower to fade. But thou, . . . all knowing as thou art, Why askest thou of me? O Father, oldest, holiest, wisest, best, To whom all things are plain, Why askest thou of me? CASYAPA. Knowest thou Kehama? EREENIA. The Almighty Man! Who knows not him and his tremendous power? The Tyrant of the Earth, The Enemy of Heaven! CASYAPA. Fearest thou the Rajah? EREENIA. He is terrible! CASYAPA. Yea, he is terrible! such power hath he That hope hath entered Hell. The Asuras and the spirits of the damn'd Acclaim their Hero; Yamen, with the might Of Godhead, scarce can quell The rebel race accurst: Half from their beds of torture they uprise, And half uproot their chains. Is there not fear in Heaven? The Souls that are in bliss suspend their joy; The danger hath disturb'd The calm of Deity, And Brama fears, and Veeshnoo turns his face In doubt toward Seeva's throne. EREENIA. I have seen Indra tremble at his prayers, And at his dreadful penances turn pale. They claim and wrest from Seeva power so vast, That even Seeva's self, The Highest, cannot grant and be secure. CASYAPA. And darest thou, Ereenia, brave The Almighty Tyrant's power? EREENIA. I brave him, Father! I? CASYAPA. Darest thou brave his vengeance? . . . For, if not, Take her again to earth, Cast her before the Tyger in his path, Or where the death-dew-dropping tree May work Kehama's will. EREENIA. Never! CASYAPA. Then meet his wrath! for He, even He, Hath set upon this worm his wanton foot. EREENIA. I knew her not, how wretched and how fair, When here I wafted her.... poor Child of Earth, Shall I forsake thee, seeing thee so fair, So wretched? O my Father, let the Maid Dwell in the Sacred Grove! CASYAPA. That must not be, For Force and Evil then would enter here; Ganges, the holy stream which cleanseth sin, Would flow from hence polluted in its springs, And they who gasp upon its banks in death, Feel no salvation. Piety, and Peace, And Wisdom, these are mine; but not the power Which could protect her from the Almighty Man; Nor when the spirit of dead Arvalan Should persecute her here to glut his rage, To heap upon her yet more agony, And ripen more damnation for himself. EREENIA. Dead Arvalan? CASYAPA. All power to him, whereof The disembodied spirit in its state Of weakness could be made participant, Kehama hath assign'd, until his days Of wandering shall be number'd. EREENIA. Look! she drinks The gale of healing from the blessed Groves. She stirs, and lo! her hand Hath touch'd the Holy River in its source, Who would have shrunk if aught impure were nigh. CASYAPA. The Maiden, of a truth, is pure from sin. 5. The waters of the Holy Spring About the hand of Kailyal play; They rise, they sparkle, and they sing, Leaping where languidly she lay, As if with that rejoicing stir The Holy Spring would welcome her. The Tree of life which o'er her spread, Benignant bow'd its sacred head, And dropt its dews of healing; And her heart-blood at every breath, Recovering from the strife of death, Drew in new strength and feeling. Behold her beautiful in her repose, A life-bloom reddening now her dark-brown cheek; And lo! her eyes unclose, Dark as the depth of Ganges' spring profound When night hangs over it, Bright as the moon's refulgent beam, That quivers on its clear up-sparkling stream. 6. Soon she let fall her lids, As one who, from a blissful dream Waking to thoughts of pain, Fain would return to sleep, and dream again. Distrustful of the sight, She moves not, fearing to disturb The deep and full delight. In wonder fix'd, opening again her eye She gazes silently, Thinking her mortal pilgrimage was past, That she had reach'd her heavenly home of rest, And these were Gods before her, Or spirits of the blest. 7. Lo! at Ereenia's voice, A Ship of Heaven comes sailing down the skies. Where would'st thou bear her? cries The ancient Sire of Gods. Straight to the Swerga, to my bower of bliss, The Glendoveer replies, To Indra's own abodes. Foe of her foe, were it alone for this Indra should guard her from his vengeance there; But if the God forbear, Unwilling yet the perilous strife to try, Or shrinking from the dreadful Rajah's might, . . . Weak as I am, O Father, even I Stand forth in Seeva's sight. 8. Trust thou in him whate'er betide, And stand forth fearlessly! The Sire of Gods replied: All that He wills is right, and doubt not thou, Howe'er our feeble scope of sight May fail us now, His righteous will in all things must be done. My blessing be upon thee, O my son! VII. THE SWERGA. 1. Then in the Ship of Heaven, Ereenia laid The waking, wondering Maid; The Ship of Heaven, instinct with thought, display'd Its living sail, and glides along the sky. On either side in wavy tide, The clouds of morn along its path divide; The Winds who swept in wild career on high, Before its presence check their charmed force; The Winds that loitering lagg'd along their course, Around the living Bark enamour'd play, Swell underneath the sail, and sing before its way. 2. That Bark, in shape, was like the furrow'd shell Wherein the Sea-Nymphs to their parent-King, On festal day, their duteous offerings bring. Its hue? . . . Go watch the last green light Ere Evening yields the western sky to Night; Or fix upon the Sun thy strenuous sight Till thou hast reach'd its orb of chrysolite. The sail from end to end display'd Bent, like a rainbow, o'er the Maid. An Angel's head, with visual eye, Through trackless space, directs its chosen way; Nor aid of wing, nor foot, nor fin, Requires to voyage o'er the obedient sky. Smooth as the swan when not a breeze at even Disturbs the surface of the silver stream, Through air and sunshine sails the Ship of Heaven. 3. Recumbent there the Maiden glides along On her aërial way, How swift she feels not, though the swiftest wind Had flagg'd in flight behind. Motionless as a sleeping babe she lay, And all serene in mind, Feeling no fear; for that etherial air With such new life and joyance fill'd her heart, Fear could not enter there; For sure she deem'd her mortal part was o'er, And she was sailing to the heavenly shore; And that angelic form, who moved beside, Was some good Spirit sent to be her guide. 4. Daughter of Earth! therein thou deem'st aright; And never yet did form more beautiful, In dreams of night descending from on high, Bless the religious Virgin's gifted sight, Nor like a vision of delight, Rise on the raptured Poet's inward eye. Of human form divine was he, The immortal Youth of Heaven who floated by, Even such as that divinest form shall be In those blest stages of our onward race, When no infirmity, Low thought, nor base desire, nor wasting care, Deface the semblance of our heavenly sire. 5. The wings of Eagle or of Cherubim Had seem'd unworthy him; Angelic power and dignity and grace Were in his glorious pennons; from the neck Down to the ankle reach'd their swelling web Richer than robes of Tyrian die, that deck Imperial Majesty: Their colour like the winter's moonless sky, When all the stars of midnight's canopy Shine forth; or like the azure deep at noon, Reflecting back to heaven a brighter blue. Such was their tint when closed, but when outspread, The permeating light Shed through their substance thin a varying hue; Now bright as when the rose, Beauteous as fragrant, gives to scent and sight A like delight; now like the juice that flows From Douro's generous vine; Or ruby when with deepest red it glows; Or as the morning clouds refulgent shine, When, at forthcoming of the Lord of Day, The Orient, like a shrine, Kindles as it receives the rising ray, And heralding his way, Proclaims the presence of the Power divine. 6. Thus glorious were the wings Of that celestial Spirit, as he went Disporting through his native element. Nor these alone The gorgeous beauties that they gave to view; Through the broad membrane branched a pliant bone, Spreading like fibres from their parent stem, Its veins like interwoven silver shone, Or as the chaster hue Of pearls that grace some Sultan's diadem. Now with slow stroke and strong behold him smite The buoyant air, and now in gentler flight, On motionless wing expanded, shoot along. 7. Through air and sunshine sails the Ship of Heaven; Far far beneath them lies The gross and heavy atmosphere of earth; And with the Swerga gales, The Maid of mortal birth At every breath a new delight inhales. And now toward its port the Ship of Heaven, Swift as a falling meteor, shapes its flight, Yet gently as the dews of night that gem, And do not bend the hare-bell's slenderest stem. Daughter of Earth, Ereenia cried, alight; This is thy place of rest, the Swerga this, Lo, here my Bower of bliss! 8. He furl'd his azure wings, which round him fold Graceful as robes of Grecian chief of old. The happy Kailyal knew not where to gaze; Her eyes around in joyful wonder roam, Now turn'd upon the lovely Glendoveer, Now on his heavenly home. EREENIA. Here, Maiden, rest in peace, And I will guard thee, feeble as I am. The Almighty Rajah shall not harm thee here, While Indra keeps his throne. KAILYAL. Alas, thou fearest him! Immortal as thou art, thou fearest him! I thought that death had saved me from his power; Not even the dead are safe. EREENIA. Long years of life and happiness, O Child of Earth, be thine! From death I sav'd thee, and from all thy foes Will save thee, while the Swerga is secure. KAILYAL. Not me alone, O gentle Deveta! I have a Father suffering upon earth, A persecuted, wretched, poor, good man, For whose strange misery There is no human help, And none but I dare comfort him Beneath Kehama's Curse; O gentle Deveta, protect him too! EREENIA. Come, plead thyself to Indra! Words like thine May win their purpose, rouse his slumbering heart, And make him yet put forth his arm to wield The thunder, while the thunder is his own. 9. Then to the Garden of the Deity Ereenia led the Maid. In the mid garden tower'd a giant Tree; Rock-rooted on a mountain-top, it grew, Rear'd its unrivall'd head on high, And stretch'd a thousand branches o'er the sky, Drinking with all its leaves celestial dew. Lo! where from thence as from a living well A thousand torrents flow! For still in one perpetual shower, Like diamond drops, etherial waters fell From every leaf of all its ample bower. Rolling adown the steep From that aërial height, Through the deep shade of aromatic trees, Half-seen, the cataracts shoot their gleams of light, And pour upon the breeze Their thousand voices; far away the roar, In modulations of delightful sound, Half-heard and ever varying, floats around. Below, an ample Lake expanded lies, Blue as the o'er-arching skies; Forth issuing from that lovely Lake A thousand rivers water Paradise. Full to the brink, yet never overflowing, They cool the amorous gales, which, ever blowing, O'er their melodious surface love to stray; Then winging back their way, Their vapours to the parent Tree repay; And ending thus where they began, And feeding thus the source from whence they came, The eternal rivers of the Swerga ran, For ever renovate, yet still the same. 10. On that etherial lake, whose waters lie Blue and transpicuous, like another sky, The Elements had rear'd their King's abode. A strong controuling power their strife suspended And there their hostile essences they blended, To form a Palace worthy of the God. Built on the Lake the waters were its floor; And here its walls were water arch'd with fire, And here were fire with water vaulted o'er; And spires and pinnacles of fire Round watery cupolas aspire, And domes of rainbow rest on fiery towers; And roofs of flame are turreted around With cloud, and shafts of cloud with flame are bound. Here too the Elements for ever veer, Ranging around with endless interchanging; Pursued in love, and so in love pursuing, In endless revolutions here they roll; For ever their mysterious work renewing; The parts all shifting, still unchanged the whole. Even we on earth at intervals descry Gleams of the glory, streaks of flowing light, Openings of heaven, and streams that flash at night In fitful splendour, through the northern sky. 11. Impatient of delay, Ereenia caught The Maid aloft, and spread his wings abroad, And bore her to the presence of the God. There Indra sate upon his throne reclined, Where Devetas adore him; The lute of Nared, warbling on the wind, All tones of magic harmony combined To sooth his troubled mind, While the dark-eyed Apsaras danced before him. In vain the God-musician play'd, In vain the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven essay'd To charm him with their beauties in the dance; And when he saw the mortal Maid appear, Led by the heroic Glendoveer, A deeper trouble fill'd his countenance. What hast thou done, Ereenia, said the God, Bringing a mortal here? And while he spake his eye was on the Maid; The look he gave was solemn, not severe: No hope to Kailyal it convey'd, And yet it struck no fear; There was a sad displeasure in his air, But pity too was there. EREENIA. Hear me, O Indra! On the lower earth I found this child of man, by what mishap I know not, lying in the lap of death. Aloft I bore her to our Father's grove, Not having other thought, than when the gales Of bliss had heal'd her, upon earth again To leave its lovely daughter. Other thoughts Arose, when Casyapa declared her fate; For she is one who groans beneath the power Of the dread Rajah, terrible alike To men and Gods. His son, dead Arvalan, Arm'd with a portion, Indra, of thy power, Already wrested from thee, persecutes The Maid, the helpless one, the innocent. What then behoved me but to waft her here To my own Bower of Bliss? what other choice? The spirit of foul Arvalan not yet Hath power to enter here; here thou art yet Supreme, and yet the Swerga is thine own. INDRA. No child of man, Ereenia, in the Bowers Of Bliss may sojourn, till he hath put off His mortal part; for on mortality Time and Infirmity and Death attend, Close followers they, and in their mournful train Sorrow and Pain and Mutability. Did these find entrance here, we should behold Our joys, like earthly summers, pass away. Those joys perchance may pass; a stronger hand May wrest my sceptre, and unparadise The Swerga; . . . but, Ereenia, if we fall, Let it be Fate's own arm that casts us down, We will not rashly hasten and provoke The blow, nor bring ourselves the ruin on. EREENIA. Fear courts the blow, Fear brings the ruin on. Needs must the chariot-wheels of Destiny Crush him who throws himself before their track, Patient and prostrate. INDRA. All may yet be well. Who knows but Veeshnoo will descend and save, Once more incarnate? EREENIA. Look not there for help, Nor build on unsubstantial hope thy trust. Our Father Casyapa hath said he turns His doubtful eye to Seeva, even as thou Dost look to him for aid. But thine own strength Should for thine own salvation be put forth; Then might the higher Powers approving see And bless the brave resolve... Oh, that my arm Could wield yon lightnings which play idly there, In inoffensive radiance round thy head! The Swerga should not need a champion now, Nor Earth implore deliverance still in vain! INDRA. Thinkest thou I want the will? rash Son of Heaven, What if my arm be feeble as thine own Against the dread Kehama? He went on Conquering in irresistible career, Till his triumphant car had measured o'er The insufficient earth, and all the Kings Of men received his yoke; then had he won His will, to ride upon their necks elate, And crown his conquests with the sacrifice That should, to men and gods, proclaim him Lord And Sovereign Master of the vassal World, Sole Rajah, the Omnipotent below. The steam of that portentous sacrifice Arose to Heaven. Then was the hour to strike; Then in the consummation of his pride, His height of glory, then the thunder-bolt Should have gone forth, and hurl'd him from his throne Down to the fiery floor of Padalon, To everlasting burnings, agony Eternal, and remorse which knows no end. That hour went by: grown impious in success By prayer and penances he wrested now Such power from Fate, that soon, if Seeva turn not His eyes on earth, and no Avatar save, Soon will he seize the Swerga for his own, Roll on through Padalon his chariot wheels, Tear up the adamantine bolts which lock The accurst Asuras to its burning floor, And force the drink of Immortality From Yamen's charge... Vain were it now to strive; My thunder cannot pierce the sphere of power Wherewith, as with a girdle, he is bound. KAILYAL. Take me to earth, O gentle Deveta! Take me again to earth! This is no place Of rest for me! . . . my Father still must bear His curse... he shall not bear it all alone; Take me to earth, that I may follow him! . . . I do not fear the Almighty Man! the Gods Are feeble here; but there are higher Powers Who will not turn their eyes from wrongs like ours; Take me to earth, O gentle Deveta! . . . 12. Saying thus she knelt, and to his knees she clung And bow'd her head, in tears and silence praying. Rising anon, around his neck she flung Her arms, and there with folded hands she hung, And fixing on the guardian Glendoveer Her eyes, more eloquent than Angel's tongue, Again she cried, There is no comfort here! I must be with my Father in his pain... Take me to earth, O Deveta, again! 13. Indra with admiration heard the Maid. O Child of Earth, he cried, Already in thy spirit thus divine, Whatever weal or woe betide, Be that high sense of duty still thy guide, And all good Powers will aid a soul like thine. Then turning to Ereenia, thus he said, Take her where Ganges hath its second birth, Below our sphere, and yet above the earth; There may Ladurlad rest beyond the power Of the dread Rajah, till the fated hour. VIII. THE SACRIFICE. 1. Dost thou tremble, O Indra, O God of the Sky, Why slumber those thunders of thine? Dost thou tremble on high, . . . Wilt thou tamely the Swerga resign, . . . Art thou smitten, O Indra, with dread? Or seest thou not, seest thou not, Monarch divine, How many a day to Seeva's shrine Kehama his victim hath led? Nine and ninety days are fled, Nine and ninety steeds have bled; One more, the rite will be complete, One victim more, and this the dreadful day. Then will the impious Rajah seize thy seat, And wrest the thunder-sceptre from thy sway. Along the mead the hallow'd Steed Yet bends at liberty his way; At noon his consummating blood will flow. O day of woe! above, below, That blood confirms the Almighty Tyrant's reign! Thou tremblest, O Indra, O God of the Sky, Thy thunder is vain, Thou tremblest on high for thy power! But where is Veeshnoo at this hour, But where is Seeva's eye? Is the Destroyer blind? Is the Preserver careless for mankind? 2. Along the mead the hallow'd Steed Still wanders whereso'er he will, O'er hill, or dale, or plain; No human hand hath trick'd that mane From which he shakes the morning dew; His mouth has never felt the rein, His lips have never froth'd the chain; For pure of blemish and of stain, His neck unbroke to mortal yoke, Like Nature free the Steed must be, Fit offering for the Immortals he. A year and day the Steed must stray Wherever chance may guide his way, Before he fall at Seeva's shrine; The year and day have pass'd away, Nor touch of man hath marr'd the rite divine. And now at noon the Steed must bleed, The perfect rite to-day must force the meed Which Fate reluctant shudders to bestow; Then must the Swerga-God Yield to the Tyrant of the World below; Then must the Devetas obey The Rajah's rod, and groan beneath his hateful sway. 3. The Sun rides high; the hour is nigh; The multitude who long, Lest aught should mar the rite, In circle wide on every side, Have kept the Steed in sight, Contract their circle now, and drive him on. Drawn in long files before the Temple-court, The Rajah's archers flank an ample space; Here, moving onward still, they drive him near, Then, opening, give him way to enter here. 4. Behold him, how he starts and flings his head! On either side in glittering order spread, The archers ranged in narrowing lines appear; The multitude behind close up the rear With moon-like bend, and silently await The aweful end, The rite that shall from Indra wrest his power. In front, with far-stretched walls, and many a tower, Turret and dome and pinnacle elate, The huge Pagoda seems to load the land: And there before the gate The Bramin band expectant stand, The axe is ready for Kehama's hand. 5. Hark! at the Golden Palaces The Bramin strikes the time! One, two, three, four, a thrice-told chime, And then again, one, two. The bowl that in its vessel floats, anew Must fill and sink again, Then will the final stroke be due. The Sun rides high, the noon is nigh, And silently, as if spell bound, The multitude expect the sound. 6. Lo! how the Steed, with sudden start, Turns his quick head to every part; Long files of men on every side appear. The sight might well his heart affright, And yet the silence that is here Inspires a stranger fear; For not a murmur, not a sound Of breath or motion rises round, No stir is heard in all that mighty crowd; He neighs, and from the temple-wall The voice re-echoes loud, Loud and distinct, as from a hill Across a lonely vale, when all is still. 7. Within the temple, on his golden throne Reclined, Kehama lies, Watching with steady eyes The perfumed light that, burning bright, Metes out the passing hours. On either hand his eunuchs stand, Freshening with fans of peacock-plumes the air, Which, redolent of all rich gums and flowers, Seems, overcharged with sweets, to stagnate there. Lo! the time-taper's flame ascending slow Creeps up its coil toward the fated line; Kehama rises and goes forth, And from the altar, ready where it lies, He takes the axe of sacrifice. 8. That instant from the crowd, with sudden shout, A Man sprang out To lay upon the Steed his hand profane. A thousand archers, with unerring eye, At once let fly, And with their hurtling arrows fill the sky. In vain they fall upon him fast as rain; He bears a charmed life, which may defy All weapons, . . . and the darts that whizz around, As from an adamantine panoply Repell'd, fall idly to the ground. Kehama clasp'd his hands in agony, And saw him grasp the hallow'd courser's mane, Spring up with sudden bound, And with a frantic cry, And madman's gesture, gallop round and round. 9. They seize, they drag him to the Rajah's feet. What doom will now be his, . . . what vengeance meet Will he, who knows no mercy, now require? The obsequious guards around, with blood-hound eye, Look for the word, in slow-consuming fire, By piece-meal death, to make the wretch expire, Or hoist his living carcase, hook'd on high, To feed the fowls and insects of the sky; Or if aught worse inventive cruelty To that remorseless heart of royalty Might prompt, accursed instruments they stand To work the wicked will with wicked hand. Far other thoughts were in the multitude; Pity, and human feelings, held them still; And stifled sighs and groans supprest were there, And many a secret curse and inward prayer Call'd on the insulted Gods to save mankind. Expecting some new crime, in fear they stood, Some horror which would make the natural blood Start, with cold shudderings thrill the sinking heart, Whiten the lip, and make the abhorrent eye Roll back and close, prest in for agony. 10. How then fared he for whom the mighty crowd Suffer'd in spirit thus, . . . how then fared he? A ghastly smile was on his lip, his eye Glared with a ghastly hope, as he drew nigh, And cried aloud, Yes, Rajah! it is I! And wilt thou kill me now? The countenance of the Almighty Man Fell when he knew Ladurlad, and his brow Was clouded with despite, as one ashamed. That wretch again! indignant he exclaim'd, And smote his forehead, and stood silently Awhile in wrath: then, with ferocious smile, And eyes which seem'd to darken his dark cheek, Let him go free! he cried; he hath his Curse, And vengeance upon him can wreak no worse... But ye who did not stop him... tremble ye! 11. He bade the archers pile their weapons there: No manly courage fill'd the slavish band, No sweetening vengeance roused a brave despair. He call'd his horsemen then, and gave command To hem the offenders in, and hew them down. Ten thousand scymitars at once uprear'd, Flash up, like waters sparkling to the sun; A second time the fatal brands appear'd Lifted aloft, . . . they glitter'd then no more, Their light was gone, their splendor quench'd in gore. At noon the massacre begun, Andnight closed in before the work of death was done. IX. THE HOME-SCENE. 1. The steam of slaughter from that place of blood Spread o'er the tainted sky. Vultures, for whom the Rajah's tyranny So oft had furnish'd food, from far and nigh Sped to the lure: aloft with joyful cry, Wheeling around, they hover'd over head; Or, on the temple perch'd, with greedy eye, Impatient watch'd the dead. Far off the tygers, in the inmost wood, Heard the death shriek, and snuff'd the scent of blood; They rose, and through the covert went their way, Couch'd at the forest edge, and waited for their prey. 2. He who had sought for death went wandering on, The hope which had inspired his heart was gone, Yet a wild joyance still inflamed his face, A smile of vengeance, a triumphant glow. Where goes he? . . . Whither should Ladurlad go! Unwittingly the wretch's footsteps trace Their wonted path toward his dwelling-place; And wandering on, unknowing where, He starts like one surprized at finding he is there. 3. Behold his lowly home, By yonder broad-bough'd plane o'ershaded: There Marriataly's Image stands, And there the garland twined by Kailyal's hands Around its brow hath faded. The peacocks, at their master's sight, Quick from the leafy thatch alight, And hurry round, and search the ground, And veer their glancing necks from side to side, Expecting from his hand Their daily dole which erst the Maid supplied, Now all too long denied. 4. But as he gazed around, How strange did all accustom'd sights appear! How differently did each familiar sound Assail his alter'd ear! Here stood the marriage bower, Rear'd in that happy hour When he, with festal joy and youthful pride, Had brought Yedillian home, his beauteous bride. Leaves not its own, and many a borrow'd flower, Had then bedeck'd it, withering ere the night; But he who look'd from that auspicious day For years of long delight, And would not see the marriage bower decay, There planted and nurst up, with daily care, The sweetest herbs that scent the ambient air, And train'd them round to live and flourish there. Nor when dread Yamen's will Had call'd Yedillian from his arms away, Ceased he to tend the marriage-bower, but still, Sorrowing, had drest it like a pious rite Due to the monument of past delight. 5. He took his wonted seat before the door, . . . Even as of yore, When he was wont to view with placid eyes, His daughter at her evening sacrifice. Here were the flowers which she so carefully Did love to rear for Marriataly's brow; Neglected now, Their heavy heads were drooping, over-blown: All else appear'd the same as heretofore, All... save himself alone; How happy then, . . . and now a wretch for evermore! 6. The market-flag which hoisted high, From far and nigh, Above yon cocoa grove is seen, Hangs motionless amid the sultry sky. Loud sounds the village drum; a happy crowd Is there; Ladurlad hears their distant voices, But with their joy no more his heart rejoices; And how their old companion now may fare, Little they know, and less they care; The torment he is doom'd to bear Was but to them the wonder of a day, A burthen of sad thoughts soon put away. 7. They knew not that the wretched man was near, And yet it seem'd, to his distemper'd ear, As if they wrong'd him with their merriment. Resentfully he turn'd away his eyes, Yet turn'd them but to find Sights that enraged his mind With envious grief more wild and overpowering. The tank which fed his fields was there, and there The large-leaved lotus on the waters flowering. There, from the intolerable heat The buffaloes retreat; Only their nostrils raised to meet the air, Amid the sheltering element they rest. Impatient of the sight, he closed his eyes, And bow'd his burning head, and in despair Calling on Indra, . . . Thunder-God! he said, Thou owest to me alone this day thy throne, Be grateful, and in mercy strike me dead. 8. Despair had roused him to that hopeless prayer, Yet thinking on the heavenly Powers, his mind Drew comfort; and he rose and gather'd flowers, And twined a crown for Marriataly's brow; And taking then her wither'd garland down, Replaced it with the blooming coronal. Not for myself, the unhappy Father cried, Not for myself, O Mighty One! I pray, Accursed as I am beyond thy aid! But, oh! be gracious still to that dear Maid Who crown'd thee with these garlands day by day, And danced before thee aye at even-tide In beauty and in pride. O Marriataly, wheresoe'er she stray Forlorn and wretched, still be thou her guide! 9. A loud and fiendish laugh replied, Scoffing his prayer. Aloft, as from the air, The sound of insult came: he look'd, and there The visage of dead Arvalan came forth, Only his face amid the clear blue sky, With long-drawn lips of insolent mockery, And eyes whose lurid glare Was like a sulphur fire, Mingling with darkness ere its flames expire. 10. Ladurlad knew him well: enraged to see The cause of all his misery, He stoop'd and lifted from the ground A stake, whose fatal point was black with blood; The same wherewith his hand had dealt the wound, When Arvalan, in hour with evil fraught, For violation seized the shrieking Maid. Thus arm'd, in act again to strike he stood, And twice with inefficient wrath essay'd To smite the impassive shade. The lips of scorn their mockery-laugh renew'd, And Arvalan put forth a hand and caught The sunbeam, and condensing there its light, Upon Ladurlad turn'd the burning stream. Vain cruelty! the stake Fell in white ashes from his hold, but he Endured no added pain; his agony Was full, and at the height; The burning stream of radiance nothing harm'd him; A fire was in his heart and brain, And from all other flame Kehama's Curse had charm'd him. 11. Anon the Spirit waved a second hand; Down rush'd the obedient whirlwind from the sky, Scoop'd up the sand like smoke, and from on high Shed the hot shower upon Ladurlad's head. Where'er he turns, the accursed Hand is there; East, West, and North, and South, on every side The Hand accursed waves in air to guide The dizzying storm; ears, nostrils, eyes, and mouth It fills and choaks, and clogging every pore, Taught him new torments might be yet in store. Where shall he turn to fly? behold his house In flames! uprooted lies the marriage-bower, The Goddess buried by the sandy shower. Blindly, with staggering step, he reels about, And still the accursed Hand pursued, And still the lips of scorn their mockery-laugh renew'd. 12. What, Arvalan! hast thou so soon forgot The grasp of Pollear? Wilt thou still defy The righteous Powers of heaven? or know'st thou not That there are yet superior Powers on high, Son of the Wicked? . . . Lo, in rapid flight, Ereenia hastens from the etherial height, Bright is the sword celestial in his hand; Like lightning in its path athwart the sky, He comes and drives, with angel-arm, the blow. Oft have the Asuras, in the wars of Heaven, Felt that keen sword by arm angelic driven. And fled before it from the fields of light. Thrice through the vulnerable shade The Glendoveer impels the griding blade, The wicked Shade flies howling from his foe. So let that Spirit foul Fly, and for impotence of anger, howl, Writhing with anguish, and his wounds deplore; Worse punishment hath Arvalan deserved, And righteous Fate hath heavier doom in store. 13. Not now the Glendoveer pursues his flight; He bade the Ship of Heaven alight, And gently there he laid The astonish'd Father by the happy Maid, The Maid now shedding tears of deep delight. Beholding all things with incredulous eyes, Still dizzy with the sand-storm, there he lay, While sailing up the skies, the living Bark Through air and sunshine held its heavenly way. X. MOUNT-MERU. 1. Swift through the sky the vessel of the Suras Sails up the fields of ether like an Angel. Rich is the freight, O Vessel, that thou bearest! Beauty and Virtue, Fatherly cares and filial veneration, Hearts which are proved and strengthen'd by affliction, Manly resentment, fortitude and action, Womanly goodness; All with which Nature halloweth her daughters, Tenderness, truth, and purity and meekness, Piety, patience, faith and resignation, Love and devotement. Ship of the Gods, how richly art thou laden! Proud of the charge, thou voyagest rejoicing, Clouds float around to honour thee, and Evening Lingers in heaven. 2. A Stream descends on Meru mountain; None hath seen its secret fountain; It had its birth, so Sages say, Upon the memorable day When Parvati presumed to lay, In wanton play, Her hands, too venturous Goddess, in her mirth, On Seeva's eyes, the light and life of Earth. Thereat the heart of the Universe stood still; The Elements ceased their influences; the Hours Stopt on the eternal round; Motion and Breath, Time, Change, and Life and Death, In sudden trance opprest, forgot their powers. A moment, and the dread eclipse was ended; But at the thought of Nature thus suspended, The sweat on Seeva's forehead stood, And Ganges thence upon the world descended The Holy River, the Redeeming Flood. 3. None hath seen its secret fountain; But on the top of Meru Mountain Which rises o'er the hills of earth, In light and clouds, it hath its mortal birth. Earth seems that pinnacle to rear Sublime above this worldly sphere, Its cradle, and its altar, and its throne; And there the new-born River lies Outspread beneath its native skies, As if it there would love to dwell Alone and unapproachable. Soon flowing forward, and resign'd To the will of the Creating Mind, It springs at once, with sudden leap, Down from the immeasurable steep. From rock to rock, with shivering force rebounding, The mighty cataract rushes; Heaven around, Like thunder, with the incessant roar resounding, And Meru's summit shaking with the sound. Wide spreads the snowy foam, the sparkling spray Dances aloft; and ever there at morning The earliest sunbeams haste to wing their way, With rainbow wreaths the holy stream adorning; And duly the adoring Moon at night Sheds her white glory there, And in the watery air Suspends her halo-crowns of silver light. 4. A mountain-valley in its blessed breast Receives the stream, which there delights to lie, Untroubled and at rest, Beneath the untainted sky. There in a lovely lake it seems to sleep, And thence through many a channel dark and deep, Their secret way the holy Waters wind, Till, rising underneath the root Of the Tree of Life on Hemakoot, Majestic forth they flow to purify mankind. 5. Towards this Lake, above the nether sphere, The living Bark with angel eye Directs its course along the obedient sky. Kehama hath not yet dominion here; And till the dreaded hour, When Indra by the Rajah shall be driven Dethroned from Heaven, Here may Ladurlad rest beyond his power. 6. The living Bark alights; the Glendoveer Then lays Ladurlad by the blessed Lake; . . . O happy Sire, and yet more happy Daughter! The etherial gales his agony aslake, His daughter's tears are on his cheek, His hand is in the water; The innocent man, the man opprest, Oh joy! . . . hath found a place of rest Beyond Kehama's sway; The Curse extends not here; his pains have past away. 7. O happy Sire, and happy Daughter! Ye on the banks of that celestial water Your resting place and sanctuary have found. What! hath not then their mortal taint defiled The sacred solitary ground? Vain thought! the Holy Valley smiled Receiving such a Sire and Child; Ganges, who seem'd asleep to lie, Beheld them with benignant eye, And rippled round melodiously, And roll'd her little waves, to meet And welcome their beloved feet. The gales of Swerga thither fled, And heavenly odours there were shed About, below, and overhead; And Earth rejoicing in their tread, Hath built them up a blooming Bower, Where every amaranthine flower Its deathless blossom interweaves With bright and undecaying leaves. 8. Three happy beings are there here, The Sire, the Maid, the Glendoveer. A fourth approaches, . . . who is this That enters in the Bower of Bliss? No form so fair might painter find Among the daughters of mankind; For death her beauties hath refined, And unto her a form hath given Framed of the elements of Heaven; Pure dwelling place for perfect mind. She stood and gazed on Sire and Child; Her tongue not yet had power to speak, The tears were streaming down her cheek; And when those tears her sight beguiled, And still her faltering accents fail'd, The Spirit, mute and motionless, Spread out her arms for the caress, Made still and silent with excess Of love and painful happiness. 9. The Maid that lovely form survey'd; Wistful she gazed, and knew her not, But Nature to her heart convey'd A sudden thrill, a startling thought, A feeling many a year forgot, Now like a dream anew recurring, As if again in every vein Her mother's milk was stirring. With straining neck and earnest eye She stretch'd her hands imploringly, As if she fain would have her nigh, Yet fear'd to meet the wish'd embrace, At once with love and awe opprest. Not so Ladurlad; he could trace, Though brighten'd with angelic grace, His own Yedillian's earthly face; He ran and held her to his breast! Oh joy above all joys of Heaven, By Death alone to others given, This moment hath to him restored The early-lost, the long-deplored. 10. They sin who tell us Love can die. With life all other passions fly, All others are but vanity. In Heaven Ambition cannot dwell, Nor Avarice in the vaults of Hell; Earthly these passions of the Earth, They perish where they have their birth; But Love is indestructible. Its holy flame for ever burneth, From Heaven it came, to Heaven returneth; Too oft on Earth a troubled guest, At times deceived, at times opprest, It here is tried and purified, Then hath in Heaven its perfect rest: It soweth here with toil and care, But the harvest time of Love is there. 11. Oh! when a Mother meets on high The Babe she lost in infancy, Hath she not then, for pains and fears, The day of woe, the watchful night, For all her sorrow, all her tears, An over-payment of delight? 12. A blessed family is this Assembled in the bower of Bliss! Strange woe, Ladurlad, hath been thine, And pangs beyond all human measure, And thy reward is now divine, A foretaste of eternal pleasure. He knew indeed there was a day When all these joys would pass away, And he must quit this blest abode; And, taking up again the spell, Groan underneath the baleful load, And wander o'er the world again Most wretched of the sons of men: Yet was this brief repose, as when A traveller in the Arabian sands, Half-fainting on his sultry road, Hath reach'd the water-place at last; And resting there beside the well, Thinks of the perils he has past, And gazes o'er the unbounded plain, The plain which must be traversed still, And drinks, . . . yet cannot drink his fill; Then girds his patient loins again. So to Ladurlad now was given New strength, and confidence in heaven, And hope, and faith invincible. 13. For often would Ereenia tell Of what in elder days befell, When other Tyrants in their might, Usurp'd dominion o'er the earth; And Veeshnoo took a human birth, Deliverer of the Sons of men, And slew the huge Ermaccasen, And piece-meal rent, with lion force, Errenen's accursed corse, And humbled Baly in his pride; And when the Giant Ravanen Had borne triumphant from his side Sita, the earth-born God's beloved bride, Then from his island-kingdom, laugh'd to scorn The insulted husband, and his power defied; How to revenge the wrong in wrath he hied, Bridging the sea before his dreadful way, And met the hundred-headed foe, And dealt him the unerring blow; By Brama's hand the righteous lance was given, And by that arm immortal driven, It laid the mighty Tyrant low; And Earth and Ocean, and high Heaven, Rejoiced to see his overthrow. Oh! doubt not thou, Yedillian cried, Such fate Kehama will betide; For there are Gods who look below, . . . Seeva, the Avenger, is not blind, Nor Veeshnoo careless for mankind. 14. Thus was Ladurlad's soul imbued With hope and holy fortitude; And Child and Sire, with pious mind, Alike resolved, alike resign'd, Look'd onward to the evil day: Faith was their comfort, Faith their stay; They trusted woe would pass away, And Tyranny would sink subdued, And Evil yield to Good. 15. Lovely wert thou, O Flower of Earth! Above all flowers of mortal birth; But foster'd in this blissful bower, From day to day, and hour to hour, Lovelier grew the lovely flower. O blessed, blessed company! When men and heavenly spirits greet, And they whom Death had sever'd meet, And hold again communion sweet; . . . O blessed, blessed company! 16. The Sun, careering round the sky, Beheld them with rejoicing eye, And bade his willing Charioteer Relax his speed as they drew near; Arounin check'd the rainbow reins, The seven green coursers shook their manes, And brighter rays around them threw; The Car of Glory in their view More radiant, more resplendent grew; And Surya, through his veil of light, Beheld the Bower, and blest the sight. 17. The Lord of Night, as he sail'd by, Stay'd his pearly boat on high; And while around the blissful Bower, He bade the softest moonlight flow, Linger'd to see that earthly flower, Forgetful of his Dragon foe, Who, mindful of their ancient feud, With open jaws of rage pursued. 18. There all good Spirits of the air, Suras and Devetas repair; Aloft they love to hover there, And view the flower of mortal birth Here for her innocence and worth, Transplanted from the fields of earth; . . . And him, who on the dreadful day When Heaven was fill'd with consternation, And Indra trembled with dismay, And for the sounds of joy and mirth, Woe was heard and lamentation, Defied the Rajah in his pride, Though all in Heaven and Earth beside Stood mute in dolorous expectation; And, rushing forward in that hour, Saved the Swerga from his power. Grateful for this they hover nigh, And bless that blessed Company. 19. One God alone, with wanton eye, Beheld them in their Bower; O ye, he cried, who have defied The Rajah, will ye mock my power? 'Twas Camdeo riding on his lory, 'Twas the immortal Youth of Love; If men below and Gods above, Subject alike, quoth he, have felt these darts, Shall ye alone, of all in story, Boast impenetrable hearts? Hover here, my gentle lory, Gently hover, while I see To whom hath Fate decreed the glory, To the Glendoveer or me. 20. Then, in the dewy evening sky, The bird of gorgeous plumery Poised his wings and hover'd nigh. It chanced at that delightful hour Kailyal sate before the Bower, On the green bank with amaranth sweet, Where Ganges warbled at her feet. Ereenia there, before the Maid, His sails of ocean blue display'd; And sportive in her sight, Moved slowly o'er the lake with gliding flight; Anon, with sudden stroke and strong, In rapid course careering, swept along; Now shooting downward from his heavenly height, Plunged in the deep below, Then rising, soar'd again, And shook the sparkling waters off like rain, And hovering o'er the silver surface hung. At him young Camdeo bent the bow; With living bees the bow was strung, The fatal bow of sugar-cane, And flowers which would inflame the heart With their petals barb'd the dart. 21. The shaft, unerringly addrest, Unerring flew, and smote Ereenia's breast. Ah, Wanton! cried the Glendoveer, Go aim at idler hearts, Thy skill is baffled here! A deeper love I bear that Maid divine, A love that springeth from a higher will, A holier power than thine! 22. A second shaft, while thus Ereenia cried, Had Camdeo aim'd at Kailyal's side; But, lo! the Bees which strung his bow Broke off, and took their flight. To that sweet Flower of earth they wing their way, Around her raven tresses play, And buzz about her with delight, As if with that melodious sound, They strove to pay their willing duty To mortal purity and beauty. 23. Ah! Wanton! cried the Glendoveer, No power hast thou for mischief here! Choose thou some idler breast, For these are proof, by nobler thoughts possest. Go, to thy plains of Matra go, And string again thy broken bow! 24. Rightly Ereenia spake; and ill had thoughts Of earthly love beseem'd the sanctuary Where Kailyal had been wafted, that the Soul Of her dead Mother there might strengthen her, Feeding her with the milk of heavenly lore, And influxes of Heaven imbue her heart With hope and faith, and holy fortitude, Against the evil day. Here rest a while In peace, O father! mark'd for misery Above all sons of men; O daughter! doom'd For sufferings and for trials above all Of women; . . . yet both favour'd, both beloved By all good Powers, rest here a while in peace. XI. THE ENCHANTRESS. 1. When from the sword by arm angelic driven, Foul Arvalan fled howling, wild in pain, His thin essential spirit, rent and riven With wounds, united soon and heal'd again; Backward the accursed turn'd his eye in flight, Remindful of revengeful thoughts even then, And saw where, gliding through the evening light, The Ship of Heaven sail'd upward through the sky, Then, like a meteor, vanish'd from his sight. Where should he follow? vainly might he try To trace through trackless air its rapid course, Nor dared he that angelic arm defy, Still sore and writhing from its dreaded force. 2. Should he the lust of vengeance lay aside? Too long had Arvalan in ill been train'd; Nurst up in power and tyranny and pride, His soul the ignominious thought disdain'd. Or to his mighty Father should he go, Complaining of defeature twice sustain'd, And ask new powers to meet the immortal foe? . . Repulse he fear'd not, but he fear'd rebuke, And shamed to tell him of his overthrow. There dwelt a dread Enchantress in a nook Obscure; old helpmate she to him had been, Lending her aid in many a secret sin; And there, for counsel, now his way he took. 3. She was a woman whose unlovely youth, Even like a canker'd rose which none will cull, Had wither'd on the stalk; her heart was full Of passions which had found no natural scope, Feelings which there had grown but ripen'd not, Desires unsatisfied, abortive hope, Repinings which provoked vindictive thought: These restless elements for ever wrought, Fermenting in her with perpetual stir, And thus, her spirit to all evil moved, She hated men because they loved not her, And hated women because they were lov'd. And thus, in wrath and hatred and despair, She tempted Hell to tempt her; and resign'd Her body to the Demons of the Air, Wicked and wanton fiends, who where they will Wander abroad, still seeking to do ill, And take whatever vacant form they find, Carcase of man or beast that life hath left, Foul instrument for them of fouler mind. To these the Witch her wretched body gave, So they would wreak her vengeance on mankind; She thus at once their mistress and their slave; And they to do such service nothing loth, Obey'd her bidding, slaves and masters both. 4. So from this cursed intercourse she caught Contagious power of mischief, and was taught Such secrets as are damnable to guess. Is there a child whose little lovely ways Might win all hearts, . . . on whom his parents gaze Till they shed tears of joy and tenderness? Oh! hide him from that Witch's withering sight! Oh! hide him from the eye of Lorrinite! Her look hath crippling in it, and her curse All plagues which on mortality can light; Death is his doom if she behold, . . . or worse, . . . Diseases loathsome and incurable, And inward sufferings that no tongue can tell. 5. Woe was to him, on whom that eye of hate Was bent; for, certain as the stroke of Fate, It did its mortal work, nor human arts Could save the unhappy wretch, her chosen prey; For gazing, she consumed his vital parts, Eating his very core of life away. The wine which from yon wounded palm on high Fills yonder gourd, as slowly it distills, Grows sour at once if Lorrinite pass by. The deadliest worm from which all creatures fly, Fled from the deadlier venom of her eye; The babe unborn, within its mother's womb, Started and trembled when the Witch came nigh; And in the silent chambers of the tomb, Death shudder'd her unholy tread to hear, And from the dry and mouldering bones did fear Force a cold sweat, when Lorrinite was near. 6. Power made her haughty: by ambition fired, Ere long to mightier mischiefs she aspired. The Calis, who o'er Cities rule unseen, Each in her own domain a Demon Queen, And there adored with blood and human life, They knew her, and in their accurst employ She stirr'd up neighbouring states to mortal strife. Sani, the dreadful God, who rides abroad Upon the King of the Ravens, to destroy The offending sons of men, when his four hands Were weary with their toil, would let her do His work of vengeance upon guilty lands; And Lorrinite, at his commandment, knew When the ripe earthquake should be loosed, and where To point its course. And in the baneful air The pregnant seeds of death he bade her strew, All deadly plagues and pestilence to brew. The Locusts were her army, and their bands, Where'er she turn'd her skinny finger, flew. The floods in ruin roll'd at her commands; And when, in time of drought, the husbandman Beheld the gather'd rain about to fall, Her breath would drive it to the desert sands, While in the marshes' parch'd and gaping soil, The rice-roots by the searching Sun were dried, And in lean groupes, assembled at the side Of the empty tank, the cattle dropt and died; And Famine, at her bidding, wasted wide The wretched land, till, in the public way, Promiscuous where the dead and dying lay, Dogs fed on human bones in the open light of day. 7. Her secret cell the accursed Arvalan, In quest of vengeance sought, and thus began. Mighty mother! mother wise! Revenge me on my enemies. LORRINITE. Comest thou, son, for aid to me? Tell me who have injured thee, Where they are, and who they be; Of the Earth, or of the Sea, Or of the aërial company? Earth, nor Sea, nor Air is free From the powers who wait on me, And my tremendous witchery. ARVALAN. She for whom so ill I sped, Whom my Father deemeth dead, Lives, for Marriataly's aid From the water saved the Maid. In hatred I desire her still, And in revenge would have my will. A Deveta with wings of blue, And sword whose edge even now I rue, In a Ship of Heaven on high, Pilots her along the sky. Where they voyage thou canst tell, Mistress of the mighty spell. 8. At this the Witch, through shrivell'd lips and thin, Sent forth a sound half-whistle and half-hiss. Two winged Hands came in, Armless and bodyless, Bearing a globe of liquid crystal, set In frame as diamond bright, yet black as jet. A thousand eyes were quench'd in endless night To form that magic globe; for Lorrinite Had, from their sockets, drawn the liquid sight, And kneaded it, with re-creating skill, Into this organ of her mighty will. Look in yonder orb, she cried, Tell me what is there descried. 9.ARVALAN. A mountain top, in clouds of light Enveloped rises on my sight; Thence a cataract rushes down, Hung with many a rainbow crown; Light and clouds conceal its head; Below, a silver Lake is spread; Upon its shores a Bower I see, Fit home for blessed company. See they come forward, . . one, two, three, . . The last a Maiden, . . . it is she! The foremost shakes his wings of blue, 'Tis he whose sword even yet I rue; And in that other one I know The visage of my deadliest foe. Mother, let thy magic might Arm me for the mortal fight; Helm and shield and mail afford, Proof against his dreaded sword. Then will I invade their seat, Then shall vengeance be compleat. 10. LORRINITE. Spirits, who obey my will, Hear him, and his wish fulfil! So spake the mighty Witch, nor farther spell Needed; anon a sound, like smother'd thunder, Was heard, slow rolling under; The solid pavement of the cell Quaked, heaved, and cleft asunder, And at the feet of Arvalan display'd, Helmet and mail, and shield and scymitar, were laid. 11. The Asuras, often put to flight And scatter'd in the fields of light By their foes' celestial might, Forged this enchanted armour for the fight. 'Mid fires intense did they anneal, In mountain furnaces, the quivering steel, Till, trembling through each deepening hue, It settled in a midnight blue; Last they cast it, to aslake, In the penal icy lake. Then they consign'd it to the Giant brood; And while they forged the impenetrable arms, The Evil Powers, to oversee them, stood, And there imbued The work of Giant strength with magic charms. Foul Arvalan, with joy, survey'd The crescent sabre's cloudy blade, With deeper joy the impervious mail, The shield and helmet of avail. Soon did he himself array, And bade her speed him on his way. 12. Then she led him to the den, Where her chariot, night and day, Stood harness'd ready for the way. Two Dragons, yoked in adamant, convey The magic car; from either collar sprung An adamantine rib, which met in air, O'er-arch'd, and crost and bent diverging there, And firmly in its arc upbore, Upon their brazen necks, the seat of power. Arvalan mounts the car, and in his hand Receives the magic reins from Lorrinite; The dragons, long obedient to command, Their ample sails expand; Like steeds well-broken to fair lady's hand, They feel the reins of might, And up the northern sky begin their flight. 13. Son of the Wicked, doth thy soul delight To think its hour of vengeance now is nigh? Lo! where the far-off light Of Indra's palace flashes on his sight, And Meru's heavenly summit shines on high, With clouds of glory bright, Amid the dark-blue sky. Already, in his hope, doth he espy, Himself secure in mail of tenfold charms, Ereenia writhing from the magic blade, The Father sent to bear his Curse, . . the Maid Resisting vainly in his impious arms. 14. Ah, Sinner! whose anticipating soul Incurs the guilt even when the crime is spared! Joyous toward Meru's summit on he fared, While the twin Dragons, rising as he guides, With steady flight, steer northward for the pole. Anon, with irresistible controul, Force mightier far than his arrests their course; It wrought as though a Power unseen had caught Their adamantine yokes to drag them on. Straight on they bend their way, and now, in vain, Upward doth Arvalan direct the rein; The rein of magic might avails no more, Bootless its strength against that unseen Power That in their mid career, Hath seized the Chariot and the Charioteer. With hands resisting, and down-pressing feet Upon their hold insisting, He struggles to maintain his difficult seat. Seeking in vain with that strange Power to vie, Their doubled speed the affrighted Dragons try. Forced in a stream from whence was no retreat, Strong as they are, behold them whirled along, Headlong, with useless pennons, through the sky. 15. What Power was that, which, with resistless might, Foil'd the dread magic thus of Lorrinite? 'Twas all-commanding Nature.. They were here Within the sphere of the adamantine rocks Which gird Mount Meru round, as far below That heavenly height where Ganges hath its birth Involv'd in clouds and light, So far above its roots of ice and snow. 16. On.. on they roll, . . rapt headlong they roll on; . . The lost canoe, less rapidly than this, Down the precipitous stream is whirl'd along To the brink of Niagara's dread abyss. On.. on they roll, and now, with shivering shock, Are dash'd against the rock that girds the Pole. Down from his shatter'd mail the unhappy Soul Is dropt, . . ten thousand thousand fathoms down, . . . Till in an ice-rift, 'mid the eternal snow, Foul Arvalan is stopt. There let him howl, Groan there, . . and there with unavailing moan, For aid on his Almighty Father call. 17. All human sounds are lost Amid those deserts of perpetual frost, Old Winter's drear domain, Beyond the limits of the living World, Beyond Kehama's reign. Of utterance and of motion soon bereft, Frozen to the ice-rock, there behold him lie, Only the painful sense of Being left, A Spirit who must feel, and cannot die, Bleaching and bare beneath the polar sky. XII. THE SACRIFICE COMPLEATED. 1. O ye who, by the Lake On Meru Mount, partake The joys which Heaven hath destin'd for the blest, Swift, swift, the moments fly, The silent hours go by, And ye must leave your dear abode of rest. O wretched Man, prepare Again thy Curse to bear! Prepare, O wretched Maid, for farther woe! The fatal hour draws near, When Indra's heavenly sphere Must own the Tyrant of the World below. To-day the hundredth Steed, At Seeva's shrine must bleed, The dreadful sacrifice is full to-day; Nor man nor God hath power, At this momentous hour, Again to save the Swerga from his sway. Fresh woes, O Maid divine, Fresh trials must be thine: And what must thou, Ladurlad, yet endure! But let your hearts be strong, And rise against all wrong, For Providence is just, and virtue is secure. 2. They, little deeming that the fatal day Was come, beheld where through the morning sky A Ship of Heaven drew nigh. Onward they watch it steer its steady flight; Till wondering, they espy Old Casyapa, the Sire of Gods, alight. But when Ereenia saw the Sire appear, At that unwonted and unwelcome sight His heart receiv'd a sudden shock of fear: Thy presence doth its doleful tidings tell, O Father! cried the startled Glendoveer, The dreadful hour is near! I know it well! Not for less import would the Sire of Gods Forsake his ancient and august abodes. 3. Even so, serene the immortal Sire replies; Soon like an earthquake will ye feel the blow Which consummates the mighty sacrifice: And this World, and its Heaven, and all therein Are then Kehama's. To the second ring Of these seven Spheres, the Swerga-King, Even now, prepares for flight, Beyond the circle of the conquer'd world, Beyond the Rajah's might. Ocean, that clips this inmost of the Spheres, And girds it round with everlasting roar, Set like a gem appears Within that bending shore. Thither fly all the Sons of heavenly race: I too forsake mine ancient dwelling-place. And now, O Child and Father, ye must go: Take up the burthen of your woe, And wander once again below. With patient heart hold onward to the end, . . . Be true unto yourselves, and bear in mind That every God is still the good Man's friend; And when the Wicked have their day assign'd, Then they who suffer bravely save mankind. 4. Oh tell me, cried Ereenia, for from thee Nought can be hidden, when the end will be! Seek not to know, old Casyapa replied, What pleaseth Heaven to hide. Dark is the abyss of Time, But light enough to guide your steps is given; Whatever weal or woe betide, Turn never from the way of truth aside, And leave the event, in holy hope, to Heaven. The moment is at hand, no more delay, Ascend the etherial bark, and go your way; And Ye, of heavenly nature, follow me. 5. The will of Heaven be done, Ladurlad cried, Nor more the man replied; But placed his daughter in the etherial bark, Then took his seat beside. There was no word at parting, no adieu. Down from that empyreal height they flew: One groan Ladurlad breathed, yet utter'd not, When, to his heart and brain, The fiery Curse again like lightning shot. And now on earth the Sire and Child alight, Up soar'd the Ship of Heaven, and sail'd away from sight. 6. O ye immortal Bowers, Where hitherto the Hours Have led their dance of happiness for aye, With what a sense of woe Do ye expect the blow, And see your heavenly dwellers driven away Lo! where the aunnay-birds of graceful mien, Whose milk-white forms were seen, Lovely as Nymphs, your ancient trees between, And by your silent springs, With melancholy cry Now spread unwilling wings; Their stately necks reluctant they protend, And through the sullen sky, To other worlds, their mournful progress bend. 7. The affrighted gales to-day O'er their beloved streams no longer play, The streams of Paradise have ceased to flow; The Fountain-Tree withholds its diamond shower, In this portentous hour, . . . This dolorous hour, . . . this universal woe. Where is the Palace, whose far-flashing beams, With streaks and streams of ever-varying light, Brighten'd the polar night Around the frozen North's extremest shore? Gone like a morning rainbow, . . . like a dream, . . . A star that shoots and falls, and then is seen no more. 8. Now! now! . . . Before the Golden Palaces, The Bramin strikes the inevitable hour. The fatal blow is given, That over Earth and Heaven Confirms the Almighty Rajah in his power. All evil Spirits then, That roam the World about, Or wander through the sky, Set up a joyful shout. The Asuras and the Giants join the cry; The damn'd in Padalon acclaim Their hoped Deliverer's name; Heaven trembles with the thunder-drowning sound; Back starts affrighted Ocean from the shore, And the adamantine vaults and brazen floor Of Hell, are shaken with the roar. Up rose the Rajah through the conquer'd sky, To seize the Swerga for his proud abode; Myriads of evil Genii round him fly, As royally on wings of winds he rode, And scaled high Heaven, triumphant like a God. XIII. THE RETREAT. 1. Around her Father's neck the Maiden lock'd Her arms, when that portentous blow was given; Clinging to him she heard the dread uproar, And felt the shuddering shock which ran through Heaven; Earth underneath them rock'd, Her strong foundations heaving in commotion, Such as wild winds upraise in raving Ocean, As though the solid base were rent asunder. And lo! where, storming the astonish'd sky, Kehama and his evil host ascend! Before them rolls the thunder, Ten thousand thousand lightnings round them fly, Upward the lengthening pageantries aspire, Leaving from Earth to Heaven a widening wake of fire. 2. When the wild uproar was at length allay'd, And Earth recovering from the shock was still, Thus to her father spake the imploring Maid: Oh! by the love which we so long have borne Each other, and we ne'er shall cease to bear, . . . Oh! by the sufferings we have shared, And must not cease to share, . . One boon I supplicate in this dread hour, One consolation in this hour of woe! Father, thou hast it in thy power, Thou wilt not, Father, sure refuse me now The only comfort my poor heart can know. 3. O dearest, dearest Kailyal! with a smile Of tenderness and anguish, he replied, O best beloved, and to be loved the best, Best worthy, . . set thy duteous heart at rest. I know thy wish, and let what will betide, Ne'er will I leave thee wilfully again. My soul is strengthen'd to endure its pain; Be thou in all my wanderings, still my guide; Be thou, in all my sufferings, at my side. 4. The Maiden, at those welcome words, imprest A passionate kiss upon her father's cheek: They look'd around them then as if to seek Where they should turn, North, South, or East or West, Wherever to their vagrant feet seem'd best. But, turning from the view her mournful eyes, Oh, whither should we wander, Kailyal cries, Or wherefore seek in vain a place of rest? Have we not here the Earth beneath our tread Heaven overhead, A brook that winds through this sequester'd glade, And yonder woods, to yield us fruit and shade? The little all our wants require is nigh; Hope we have none; . . why travel on in fear? We cannot fly from Fate, and Fate will find us here. 5. 'Twas a fair scene wherein they stood, A green and sunny glade amid the wood, And in the midst an aged Banian grew. It was a goodly sight to see That venerable tree, For o'er the lawn, irregularly spread, Fifty straight columns propt its lofty head; And many a long depending shoot, Seeking to strike its root, Straight like a plummet, grew towards the ground. Some on the lower boughs which crost their way, Fixing their bearded fibres, round and round, With many a ring and wild contortion wound; Some to the passing wind at times, with sway Of gentle motion swung; Others of younger growth, unmoved, were hung Like stone-drops from the cavern's fretted height; Beneath was smooth and fair to sight, Nor weeds nor briars deform'd the natural floor, And through the leafy cope which bower'd it o'er Came gleams of chequer'd light. So like a temple did it seem, that there A pious heart's first impulse would be prayer. 6. A brook, with easy current, murmur'd near; Water so cool and clear The peasants drink not from the humble well, Which they with sacrifice of rural pride, Have wedded to the cocoa-grove beside; Nor tanks of costliest masonry dispense To those in towns who dwell, The work of Kings, in their beneficence. Fed by perpetual springs, a small lagoon, Pellucid deep and still, in silence join'd And swell'd the passing stream. Like burnish'd steel Glowing, it lay beneath the eye of noon; And when the breezes in their play, Ruffled the darkening surface, then with gleam Of sudden light, around the lotus stem It rippled, and the sacred flowers that crown The lakelet with their roseate beauty, ride In easy waving rock'd, from side to side; And as the wind upheaves Their broad and buoyant weight, the glossy leaves Flap on the twinkling waters, up and down. 7. They built them here a bower, of jointed cane, Strong for the needful use, and light and long Was the slight framework rear'd, with little pain; Lithe creepers, then, the wicker sides supply, And the tall jungle-grass fit roofing gave Beneath the genial sky. And here did Kailyal, each returning day, Pour forth libations from the brook to pay The Spirits of her Sires their grateful rite; In such libations pour'd in open glades, Beside clear streams and solitary shades, The Spirits of the virtuous dead delight. And duly here, to Marriataly's praise, The Maid, as with an angel's voice of song, Pour'd her melodious lays Upon the gales of even, And gliding in religious dance along, Moved graceful as the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven, Such harmony to all her steps was given. 8. Thus ever, in her Father's doating eye, Kailyal perform'd the customary rite; He, patient of his burning pain the while, Beheld her, and approved her pious toil; And sometimes at the sight, A melancholy smile Would gleam upon his aweful countenance. He too by day and night, and every hour, Paid to a higher Power his sacrifice; An offering, not of ghee, or fruit, and rice, Flower-crown, or blood; but of a heart subdued, A resolute, unconquer'd fortitude, An agony represt, a will resign'd, To her, who, on her secret throne reclin'd, Amid the Sea of Milk, by Veeshnoo's side, Looks with an eye of mercy on mankind. By the Preserver, with his power endued, There Voomdavee beholds this lower clime, And marks the silent sufferings of the good, To recompense them in her own good time. 9. O force of faith! O strength of virtuous will! Behold him in his endless martyrdom, Triumphant still! The Curse still burning in his heart and brain, And yet doth he remain Patient the while, and tranquil, and content! The pious soul hath framed unto itself A second nature, to exist in pain As in its own allotted element. 10. Such strength the will reveal'd had given This holy pair, such influxes of grace, That to their solitary resting place They brought the peace of Heaven. Yea, all around was hallow'd! Danger, Fear, Nor thought of evil ever enter'd here. A charm was on the Leopard when he came Within the circle of that mystic glade; Submiss he crouch'd before the heavenly maid, And offer'd to her touch his speckled side; Or with arch'd back erect, and bending head, And eyes half-closed for pleasure, would he stand, Courting the pressure of her gentle hand. 11. Trampling his path through wood and brake, And canes which crackling fall before his way, And tassel-grass, whose silvery feathers play O'ertopping the young trees, On comes the Elephant, to slake His thirst at noon in yon pellucid springs. Lo! from his trunk upturn'd, aloft he flings The grateful shower; and now Plucking the broad-leaved bough Of yonder plane, with wavey motion slow, Fanning the languid air, He moves it to and fro. But when that form of beauty meets his sight, The trunk its undulating motion stops, From his forgetful hold the plane-branch drops, Reverent he kneels, and lifts his rational eyes To her as if in prayer; And when she pours her angel voice in song, Entranced he listens to the thrilling notes, Till his strong temples, bathed with sudden dews, Their fragrance of delight and love diffuse. 12. Lo! as the voice melodious floats around, The Antelope draws near, The Tygress leaves her toothless cubs to hear; The Snake comes gliding from the secret brake Himself in fascination forced along By that enchanting song; The antic Monkies, whose wild gambols late, When not a breeze waved the tall jungle grass, Shook the whole wood, are hush'd, and silently Hang on the cluster'd tree. All things in wonder and delight are still; Only at times the Nightingale is heard, Not that in emulous skill that sweetest bird Her rival strain would try, A mighty songster, with the Maid to vie; She only bore her part in powerful sympathy. 13. Well might they thus adore that heavenly Maid! For never Nymph of Mountain, Or Grove, or Lake, or Fountain, With a diviner presence fill'd the shade. No idle ornaments deface Her natural grace, Musk-spot, nor sandal-streak, nor scarlet stain, Ear-drop nor chain, nor arm nor ankle-ring, Nor trinketry on front, or neck, or breast, Marring the perfect form: she seem'd a thing Of Heaven's prime uncorrupted work, a child Of early nature undefiled, A daughter of the years of innocence. And therefore all things loved her. When she stood Beside the glassy pool, the fish, that flies Quick as an arrow from all other eyes, Hover'd to gaze on her. The mother bird, When Kailyal's step she heard, Sought not to tempt her from her secret nest, But hastening to the dear retreat, would fly To meet and welcome her benignant eye. 14. Hope we have none, said Kailyal to her Sire. Said she aright? and had the mortal Maid No thoughts of heavenly aid, . . No secret hopes her inmost heart to move With longings of such deep and pure desire, As Vestal Maids, whose piety is love, Feel in their ecstasies, when rapt above, Their souls unto their heavenly Spouse aspire? Why else so often doth that searching eye Roam through the scope of sky? Why, if she sees a distant speck on high, Starts there that quick suffusion to her cheek? 'Tis but the Eagle in his heavenly height; Reluctant to believe, she hears his cry, And marks his wheeling flight, Then pensively averts her mournful sight. Why ever else, at morn, that waking sigh, Because the lovely form no more is nigh Which hath been present to her soul all night; And that injurious fear Which ever, as it riseth, is represt, Yet riseth still within her troubled breast, That she no more shall see the Glendoveer! 15. Hath he forgotten me? The wrongful thought Would stir within her, and though still repell'd With shame and self-reproaches, would recur. Days after days unvarying come and go, And neither friend nor foe Approaches them in their sequester'd bower. Maid of strange destiny! but think not thou Thou art forgotten now, And hast no cause for farther hope or fear; High-fated Maid, thou dost not know What eyes watch over thee for weal and woe! Even at this hour, Searching the dark decrees divine, Kehama, in the fulness of his power, Perceives his thread of fate entwine with thine. The Glendoveer, from his far sphere, With love that never sleeps, beholds thee here, And in the hour permitted will be near. Dark Lorrinite on thee hath fixed her sight, And laid her wiles, to aid Foul Arvalan when he shall next appear; For well she ween'd his Spirit would renew Old vengeance now, with unremitting hate; The Enchantress well that evil nature knew, The accursed Spirit hath his prey in view; And thus, while all their separate hopes pursue, All work, unconsciously, the will of Fate. 16. Fate work'd its own the while. A band Of Yoguees, as they roam'd the land Seeking a spouse for Jaga-Naut their God, Stray'd to this solitary glade, And reach'd the bower wherein the Maid abode. Wondering at form so fair, they deem'd the Power Divine had led them to his chosen bride, And seized and bore her from her Father's side. XIV. JAGA-NAUT. 1. Joy in the City of great Jaga-Naut! Joy in the seven-headed Idol's shrine! A virgin-bride his ministers have brought, A mortal maid, in form and face divine, Peerless among all daughters of mankind; Search'd they the world again from East to West, In endless quest, Seeking the fairest and the best, No maid so lovely might they hope to find; . . For she hath breathed celestial air, And heavenly food hath been her fare, And heavenly thoughts and feelings give her face That heavenly grace. Joy in the City of great Jaga-Naut, Joy in the seven-headed Idol's shrine! The fairest Maid his Yoguees sought, A fairer than the fairest have they brought, A maid of charms surpassing human thought, A maid divine. 2. Now bring ye forth the Chariot of the God! Bring him abroad, That through the swarming City he may ride; And by his side Place ye the Maid of more than mortal grace, The Maid of perfect form and heavenly face; Set her aloft in triumph, like a bride Upon the Bridal Car, And spread the joyful tidings wide and far, . . Spread it with trump and voice That all may hear, and all who hear rejoice, . Great Jaga-Naut hath found his mate! the God Will ride abroad! To-night will he go forth from his abode! Ye myriads who adore him, Prepare the way before him! 3. Uprear'd on twenty wheels elate, Huge as a Ship, the Bridal Car appear'd; Loud creak its ponderous wheels, as through the gate A thousand Bramins drag the enormous load. There throned aloft in state, The Image of the seven-headed God Came forth from his abode; and at his side Sate Kailyal like a bride. A bridal statue rather might she seem, For she regarded all things like a dream, Having no thought, nor fear, nor will, nor aught Save hope and faith, that lived within her still. 4. O silent night, how have they startled thee With the brazen trumpet's blare! And thou, O Moon! whose quiet light serene Filleth wide heaven, and bathing hill and wood, Spreads o'er the peaceful valley like a flood, How have they dimm'd thee with the torches' glare, Which round yon moving pageant flame and flare, As the wild rout, with deafening song and shout, Fling their long flashes out, That, like infernal lightnings, fire the air. 5. A thousand pilgrims strain Arm, shoulder, breast and thigh, with might and main, To drag that sacred wain, And scarce can draw along the enormous load. Prone fall the frantic votaries in its road, And calling on the God, Their self-devoted bodies there they lay To pave his chariot-way. On Jaga-Naut they call, The ponderous Car rolls on, and crushes all. Through flesh and bones it ploughs its dreadful path. Groans rise unheard; the dying cry, And death and agony Are trodden under foot by yon mad throng, Who follow close, and thrust the deadly wheels along. 6. Pale grows the Maid at this accursed sight; The yells which round her rise Have roused her with affright, And fear hath given to her dilated eyes where! A wilder light. Where shall those eyes be turn'd? she knows not Downward they dare not look, for there Is death, and horror, and despair; Nor can her patient looks to Heaven repair, For the huge Idol over her, in air, Spreads his seven hideous heads, and wide Extends their snaky necks on every side; And all around, behind, before, The Bridal Car, is the raging rout, With frantic shout, and deafening roar, Tossing the torches' flames about. And the double double peals of the drum are there, And the startling burst of the trumpet's blare; And the gong, that seems, with its thunders dread To astound the living, and waken the dead. The ear-strings throb as if they were rent, And the eyelids drop as stunned and spent. Fain would the Maid have kept them fast, But open they start at the crack of the blast. 7. Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia! where In this dread hour of horror and despair? Thinking on him, she strove her fear to quell, If he be near me, then will all be well; And, if he reck not for my misery, Let come the worst, it matters not to me. Repel that wrongful thought, O Maid! thou feelest, but believ'st it not; It is thine own imperfect nature's fault That lets one doubt of him arise within; And this the Virgin knew; and like a sin, Repell'd the thought, and still believed him true; And summon'd up her spirit to endure All forms of fear, in that firm trust secure. 8. She needs that faith, she needs that consolation, For now the Car hath measured back its track Of death, and hath re-entered now its station. There, in the Temple-court with song and dance, A harlot-band, to meet the Maid, advance. The drum hath ceas'd its peals; the trump and gong Are still; the frantic crowd forbear their yells; And sweet it was to hear the voice of song, And the sweet music of their girdle-bells, Armlets and anklets, that, with cheerful sound, Symphonious tinkled as they wheel'd around. 9. They sung a bridal measure, A song of pleasure, A hymn of joyaunce and of gratulation. Go, chosen One, they cried, Go, happy bride! For thee the God descends in expectation! For thy dear sake He leaves his Heaven, O Maid of matchless charms! Go, happy One, the bed divine partake, And fill his longing arms! Thus to the inner fane, With circling dance and hymeneal strain, The astonish'd Maid they led, And there they laid her on the bridal bed. Then forth they go, and close the Temple-gate, And leave the wretched Kailyal to her fate. 10. Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia, where? From the loathed bed she starts, and in the air Looks up, as if she thought to find him there? Then, in despair, Anguish and agony, and hopeless prayer, Prostrate she laid herself upon the floor. There trembling as she lay, The Bramin of the fane advanced And came to seize his prey. But as the abominable Priest drew nigh, A power invisible opposed his way; Starting, he utter'd wildly a death-cry, And fell. At that the Maid all eagerly Lifted in hope her head; She thought her own deliverer had been near; When lo! with other life re-animate, She saw the dead arise, And in the fiendish joy within his eyes, She knew the hateful Spirit who look'd through Their specular orbs, . . clothed in the flesh of man, She knew the accursed soul of Arvalan. 11. Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia, where? But not in vain, with sudden shriek of fear, She calls Ereenia now; the Glendoveer Is here! Upon the guilty sight he burst Like lightning from a cloud, and caught the accurst, Bore him to the roof aloft, and on the floor With vengeance dash'd him, quivering there in gore. Lo! from the pregnant air, . . heart-withering sight, There issued forth the dreadful Lorrinite. Seize him! the Enchantress cried; A host of Demons at her word appear, And like tornado winds, from every side At once they rush upon the Glendoveer. Alone against a legion, little here Avails his single might, Nor that celestial faulchion, which in fight So oft had put the rebel race to flight. There are no Gods on earth to give him aid; Hemm'd round, he is overpower'd, beat down, and bound, And at the feet of Lorrinite is laid. 12. Meantime the scatter'd members of the slain, Obedient to her mighty voice, assumed Their vital form again, And that foul Spirit upon vengeance bent, Fled to the fleshly tenement. Lo! here, quoth Lorrinite, thou seest thy foe! Him in the Ancient Sepulchres, below The billows of the Ocean, will I lay; Gods are there none to help him now, and there For Man there is no way. To that dread scene of durance and despair, Asuras, bear your enemy! I go To chain him in the Tombs. Meantime do thou, Freed from thy foe, and now secure from fear, Son of Kehama, take thy pleasure here. 13. Her words the accursed race obey'd; Forth with a sound like rushing winds they fled, And of all aid from Earth or Heaven bereft, Alone with Arvalan the Maid was left. But in that hour of agony, the Maid Deserted not herself; her very dread Had calm'd her; and her heart Knew the whole horror, and its only part. Yamen, receive me undefiled! she said, And seized a torch, and fired the bridal bed. Up ran the rapid flames; on every side They find their fuel wheresoe'er they spread; Thin hangings, fragrant gums, and odorous wood, That piled like sacrificial altars stood. Around they run, and upward they aspire, And, lo! the huge Pagoda lined with fire. 14. The wicked Soul, who had assumed again A form of sensible flesh for his foul will, Still bent on base revenge and baffled still, Felt that corporeal shape alike to pain Obnoxious as to pleasure: forth he flew, Howling and scorch'd by the devouring flame; Accursed Spirit! Still condemn'd to rue, The act of sin and punishment the same. Freed from his loathsome touch, a natural dread Came on the self-devoted, and she drew Back from the flames, which now toward her spread, And, like a living monster, seem'd to dart Their hungry tongues toward their shrinking prey. Soon she subdued her heart; “O Father!” she exclaim'd, “there was no way But this! And thou, Ereenia, who for me Sufferest, my soul shall bear thee company.” 15. So having said, she knit Her body up to work her soul's desire, And rush at once among the thickest fire. A sudden cry withheld her, . . “Kailyal, stay! Child! Daughter! I am here!” the voice exclaims, And from the gate, unharm'd, through smoke and flames, Like as a God, Ladurlad made his way; Wrapt his preserving arms around, and bore His Child, uninjured, o'er the burning floor. XV. THE CITY OF BALY. 1. KAILYAL. Ereenia! LADURLAD. Nay, let no reproachful thought Wrong his heroic heart! The Evil Powers Have the dominion o'er this wretched World, And no good Spirit now can venture here. KAILYAL. Alas, my Father! he hath ventured here, And saved me from one horror. But the Powers Of Evil beat him down, and bore away To some dread scene of durance and despair; The Ancient Tombs, methought their mistress said, Beneath the ocean-waves; no way for Man Is there; and Gods, she boasted, there are none On Earth to help him now. LADURLAD. Is that her boast? And hath she laid him in the Ancient Tombs, Relying that the Waves will guard him there? Short-sighted are the eyes of Wickedness, And all its craft but folly. Oh my child! The Curses of the Wicked are upon me, And the immortal Deities, who see And suffer all things for their own wise end, Have made them blessings to us! KAILYAL. Then thou knowest Where they have borne him? LADURLAD. To the Sepulchres Of the Ancient Kings, which Baly in his power Made in primeval times; and built above them A City, like the Cities of the Gods, Being like a God himself. For many an age Hath Ocean warr'd against his Palaces, Till overwhelm'd, they lie beneath the waves, Not overthrown, so well the aweful Chief Had laid their deep foundations. Rightly said The Accursed, that no way for man was there, But not like man am I! 2. Up from the ground the Maid exultant sprung, And clapp'd her happy hands in attitude Of thanks to Heaven, and flung Her arms around her Father's neck, and stood Struggling awhile for utterance, with excess Of hope and pious thankfulness. Come.. come! she cried, Oh let us not delay, . . He is in torments there, . . away! . . away! 3. Long time they travell'd on; at dawn of day Still setting forward with the earliest light, Nor ceasing from their way Till darkness closed the night. Short refuge from the noontide heat, Reluctantly compell'd, the Maiden took, And ill her indefatigable feet Could that brief respite brook. Hope kept her up, and her intense desire Supports that heart which ne'er at danger quails, Those feet which never tire, That frame which never fails. 4. Their talk was of the City of the days Of old, Earth's wonder once, and of the fame Of Baly its great founder, . . he whose name In ancient story and in poet's praise, Liveth and flourisheth for endless glory, Because his might Put down the wrong, and aye upheld the right. Till for ambition, as old sages tell, At length the universal Monarch fell: For he too, having made the World his own, Then in his pride, had driven The Devetas from Heaven, And seized triumphantly the Swerga throne. The Incarnate came before the Mighty One, In dwarfish stature, and in mien obscure; The sacred cord he bore, And ask'd, for Brama's sake, a little boon, Three steps of Baly's ample reign, no more. Poor was the boon required, and poor was he Who begg'd, . . a little wretch it seem'd to be; But Baly ne'er refused a suppliant's prayer. He on the Dwarf cast down, A glance of pity in contemptuous mood, And bade him take the boon, And measure where he would. 5. Lo, Son of giant birth, I take my grant! the Incarnate Power replies. With his first step he measured o'er the Earth, The second spann'd the skies. Three paces thou hast granted, Twice have I set my footstep, Veeshnoo cries, Where shall the third be planted? 6. Then Baly knew the God, and at his feet, In homage due, he laid his humbled head. Mighty art thou, O Lord of Earth and Heaven, Mighty art thou! he said, Be merciful, and let me be forgiven. He ask'd for mercy of the Merciful, And mercy for his virtue's sake was shown. For though he was cast down to Padalon, Yet there, by Yamen's throne, Doth Baly sit in majesty and might, To judge the dead, and sentence them aright. And forasmuch as he was still the friend Of righteousness, it is permitted him, Yearly, from those drear regions to ascend And walk the Earth, that he may hear his name Still hymn'd and honour'd by the grateful voice Of humankind, and in his fame rejoice. 7. Such was the talk they held upon their way, Of him to whose old City they were bound; And now, upon their journey, many a day Had risen and closed, and many a week gone round, And many a realm and region had they pass'd, When now the Ancient Towers appear'd at last. 8. Their golden summits in the noon-day light, Shone o'er the dark green deep that roll'd between For domes, and pinnacles, and spires were seen Peering above the sea, . . a mournful sight! Well might the sad beholder ween from thence What works of wonder the devouring wave Had swallow'd there, when monuments so brave Bore record of their old magnificence. And on the sandy shore, beside the verge Of Ocean, here and there, a rock-hewn fane Resisted in its strength the surf and surge That on their deep foundations beat in vain. In solitude the Ancient Temples stood, Once resonant with instrument and song, And solemn dance of festive multitude; Now as the weary ages pass along, Hearing no voice save of the Ocean flood, Which roars for ever on the restless shores; Or visiting their solitary caves, The lonely sound of winds, that moan around Accordant to the melancholy waves. 9. With reverence did the travellers see The works of ancient days, and silently Approach the shore. Now on the yellow sand, Where round their feet the rising surges part, They stand. Ladurlad's heart Exulted in his wonderous destiny. To Heaven he raised his hand In attitude of stern heroic pride; Oh what a power, he cried, Thou dreadful Rajah, doth thy curse impart! I thank thee now! . . Then turning to the Maid, Thou seest how far and wide Yon Towers extend, he said, My search must needs be long. Meantime the flood Will cast thee up thy food, . . And in the Chambers of the Rock by night, Take thou thy safe abode. No prowling beast to harm thee, or affright, Can enter there; but wrap thyself with care From the foul Birds obscene that thirst for blood; For in such caverns doth the Bat delight To have its haunts. Do thou with stone and shout, Ere thou liest down at evening, scare them out, And in this robe of mine involve thy feet. Duly commend us both to Heaven in prayer, Be of good heart, and may thy sleep be sweet! 10. So saying, he put back his arm, and gave The cloth which girt his loins, and press'd her hand With fervent love, then from the sand Advanced into the sea; the coming Wave Which knew Kehama's curse, before his way Started, and on he went as on dry land, And still around his path the waters parted. She stands upon the shore, where sea-weeds play, Lashing her polish'd ankles, and the spray Which off her Father, like a rainbow, fled, Falls on her like a shower; there Kailyal stands, And sees the billows rise above his head. She at the startling sight, forgot the power The Curse had given him, and held forth her hands Imploringly, . . . her voice was on the wind, And the deaf Ocean o'er Ladurlad closed. Soon she recall'd his destiny to mind, And shaking off that natural fear, composed Her soul with prayer, to wait the event resign'd. 11. Alone, upon the solitary strand, The lovely one is left; behold her go, Pacing with patient footsteps, to and fro, Along the bending sand. Save her, ye Gods! from Evil Powers, and here From man she need not fear: For never Traveller comes near These aweful ruins of the days of yore, Nor fisher's bark, nor venturous mariner, Approach the sacred shore. All day, she walk'd the beach, at night she sought The Chamber of the Rock; with stone and shout Assail'd the Bats obscene, and scared them out; Then in her Father's robe involved her feet, And wrapt her mantle round to guard her head, And laid her down; the rock was Kailyal's bed, Her chamber-lamps were in the starry sky, The winds and waters were her lullaby. 12. Be of good heart, and may thy sleep be sweet, Ladurlad said; . . Alas! that cannot be To one whose days are days of misery. How often did she stretch her hands to greet Ereenia, rescued in the dreams of night! How oft amid the vision of delight, Fear in her heart all is not as it seems; Then from unsettled slumber start, and hear The Winds that moan above, the Waves below! Thou hast been call'd, O Sleep! the friend of Woe, But 'tis the happy who have call'd thee so. 13. Another day, another night are gone, A second passes, and a third wanes on. So long she paced the shore, So often on the beach she took her stand, That the wild Sea-Birds knew her, and no more Fled, when she past beside them on the strand. Bright shine the golden summits in the light Of the noon-sun, and lovelier far by night Their moonlight glories o'er the sea they shed: Fair is the dark-green deep: by night and day Unvex'd with storms, the peaceful billows play, As when they closed upon Ladurlad's head; The firmament above is bright and clear; The sea-fowl, lords of water, air, and land, Joyous alike upon the wing appear, Or when they ride the waves, or walk the sand; Beauty and light and joy are every-where; There is no sadness and no sorrow here, Save what that single human breast contains, But oh! what hopes, and fears, and pains are there! 14. Seven miserable days the expectant Maid, From earliest dawn till evening, watch'd the shore; Hope left her then; and in her heart she said, Never should she behold her Father more. XVI. THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES. 1. When the broad Ocean on Ladurlad's head Had closed and arch'd him o'er, With steady tread he held his way Adown the sloping shore. The dark green waves with emerald hue, Imbue the beams of day, And on the wrinkled sand below, Rolling their mazy network to and fro, Light shadows shift and play. The hungry Shark, at scent of prey, Toward Ladurlad darted; Beholding then that human form erect, How like a God the depths he trod, Appall'd the monster started, And in his fear departed. Onward Ladurlad went with heart elate, And now hath reach'd the Ancient City's gate. 2. Wondering he stood awhile to gaze Upon the works of elder days. The brazen portals open stood, Even as the fearful multitude Had left them, when they fled Before the rising flood. High over-head, sublime, The mighty gateway's storied roof was spread, Dwarfing the puny piles of younger time. With the deeds of days of yore That ample roof was sculptured o'er, And many a godlike form there met his eye, And many an emblem dark of mystery. Through these wide portals oft had Baly rode Triumphant from his proud abode, When, in his greatness, he bestrode The Aullay, hugest of four-footed kind, The Aullay-Horse, that in his force, With elephantine trunk, could bind And lift the elephant, and on the wind Whirl him away, with sway and swing, Even like a pebble from the practis'd sling. 3. Those streets which never, since the days of yore, By human footstep had been visited, Those streets which never more A human foot shall tread, Ladurlad trod. In sun-light and sea-green, The thousand Palaces were seen Of that proud City, whose superb abodes Seem'd rear'd by Giants for the immortal Gods. How silent and how beautiful they stand, Like things of Nature! the eternal rocks Themselves not firmer. Neither hath the sand Drifted within their gates and choak'd their doors, Nor slime defiled their pavements and their floors. Did then the Ocean wage His war for love and envy, not in rage, O thou fair City, that he spared thee thus? Art thou Varounin's capital and court, Where all the Sea-Gods for delight resort, A place too godlike to be held by us, The poor degenerate children of the Earth? So thought Ladurlad, as he look'd around, Weening to hear the sound Of Mermaid's shell, and song Of choral throng from some imperial hall, Wherein the Immortal Powers at festival, Their high carousals keep; But all is silence dread, Silence profound and dead, The everlasting stillness of the Deep. 4. Through many a solitary street, And silent market-place, and lonely square, Arm'd with the mighty Curse, behold him fare. And now his feet attain that royal fane Where Baly held of old his aweful reign. What once had been the Gardens spread around, Fair Gardens, once which wore perpetual green, Where all sweet flowers through all the year were found, And all fair fruits were through all seasons seen; A place of Paradise, where each device Of emulous Art with Nature strove to vie; And Nature on her part, Call'd forth new powers wherewith to vanquish Art. The Swerga-God himself, with envious eye, Survey'd those peerless gardens in their prime; Nor ever did the Lord of Light, Who circles Earth and Heaven upon his way, Behold from eldest time a goodlier sight Than were the groves which Baly, in his might, Made for his chosen place of solace and delight. 5. It was a Garden still beyond all price, Even yet it was a place of Paradise; For where the mighty Ocean could not spare, There had he with his own creation, Sought to repair his work of devastation. And here were coral bowers, And grots of madrepores, And banks of sponge, as soft and fair to eye As e'er was mossy bed Whereon the Wood Nymphs lie With languid limbs in summer's sultry hours. Here too were living flowers Which, like a bud compacted, Their purple cups contracted, And now in open blossom spread, Stretch'd like green anthers many a seeking head. And arborets of jointed stone were there, And plants of fibres fine, as silkworm's thread; Yea, beautiful as Mermaid's golden hair Upon the waves dispread. Others that, like the broad banana growing, Raised their long wrinkled leaves of purple hue, Like streamers wide out-flowing. And whatsoe'er the depths of Ocean hide From human eyes, Ladurlad there espied, Trees of the deep, and shrubs and fruits and flowers, As fair as ours, Wherewith the Sea-Nymphs love their locks to braid, When to their father's hall, at festival Repairing they, in emulous array, Their charms display, To grace the banquet, and the solemn day. 6. The golden fountains had not ceased to flow; And where they mingled with the briny Sea, There was a sight of wonder and delight, To see the fish, like birds in air, Above Ladurlad flying. Round those strange waters they repair, Their scarlet fins outspread and plying, They float with gentle hovering there; And now upon those little wings, As if to dare forbidden things, With wilful purpose bent, Swift as an arrow from a bow, They shoot across, and to and fro, In rapid glance, like lightning go Through that unwonted element. 7. Almost in scenes so wondrous fair, Ladurlad had forgot The mighty cause which led him there; His busy eye was every where, His mind had lost all thought; His heart, surrender'd to the joys Of sight, was happy as a boy's. But soon the awakening thought recurs Of him who in the Sepulchres, Hopeless of human aid, in chains is laid; And her who on the solitary shore, By night and day her weary watch will keep, Till she shall see them issuing from the deep. 8. Now hath Ladurlad reach'd the Court Of the great Palace of the King, its floor Was of the marble rock; and there before The imperial door, A mighty Image on the steps was seen, Of stature huge, of countenance serene. A crown and sceptre at his feet were laid; One hand a scroll display'd, The other pointed there, that all might see; My name is Death, it said, In mercy have the Gods appointed me. Two brazen gates beneath him night and day Stood open; and within them you behold Descending steps, which in the living stone Were hewn, a spacious way Down to the Chambers of the Kings of old. 9. Trembling with hope, the adventurous man descended. The sea-green light of day Not far along the vault extended; But where the slant reflection ended, Another light was seen Of red and fiery hue, That with the water blended, And gave the secrets of the Tombs to view. 10. Deep in the marble rock, the Hall Of Death was hollow'd out, a chamber wide, Low-roof'd, and long; on either side, Each in his own alcove, and on his throne, The Kings of old were seated: in his hand Each held the sceptre of command, From whence, across that scene of endless night, A carbuncle diffused its everlasting light. 11. So well had the embalmers done their part With spice and precious unguents to imbue The perfect corpse, that each had still the hue Of living man, and every limb was still Supple and firm and full, as when of yore Its motion answered to the moving will. The robes of royalty which once they wore, Long since had mouldered off and left them bare: Naked upon their thrones behold them there, Statues of actual flesh, . . a fearful sight! Their large and rayless eyes Dimly reflecting to that gem-born light, Glazed, fix'd, and meaningless, . . . yet, open wide, Their ghastly balls belied The mockery of life in all beside. 12. But if amid these Chambers drear, Death were a sight of shuddering and of fear, Life was a thing of stranger horror here. For at the farther end, in yon alcove, Where Baly should have lain, had he obey'd Man's common lot, behold Ereenia laid. Strong fetters link him to the rock; his eye Now rolls and widens, as with effort vain He strives to break the chain, Now seems to brood upon his misery. Before him couch'd there lay One of the mighty monsters of the deep, Whom Lorrinite encountering on the way, There station'd, his perpetual guard to keep; In the sport of wanton power, she charm'd him there As if to mock the Glendoveer's despair. 13. Upward his form was human, save that here The skin was cover'd o'er with scale on scale Compact, a panoply of natural mail. His mouth, from ear to ear, Weapon'd with triple teeth, extended wide, And tusks on either side; A double snake below, he roll'd His supple length behind in many a sinuous fold. 14 With red and kindling eye, the Beast beholds A living man draw nigh, And rising on his folds, In hungry joy awaits the expected feast, His mouth half-open, and his teeth unsheath'd. Then on he sprung, and in his scaly arms Seized him, and fasten'd on his neck, to suck, With greedy lips the warm life-blood: and sure But for the mighty power of magic charms, As easily as, in the blithesome hour Of spring, a child doth crop the meadow-flower, Piecemeal those claws Had rent their victim, and those armed jaws Snapt him in twain. Naked Ladurlad stood, Yet fearless and unharm'd in this dread strife, So well Kehama's Curse had charm'd his fated life. 15. He too, . . . for anger, rising at the sight Of him he sought, in such strange thrall confined, With desperate courage fired Ladurlad's mind, . . . He too unto the fight himself addrest, And grappling breast to breast, With foot firm-planted stands, And seized the monster's throat with both his hands. Vainly, with throttling grasp, he prest The impenetrable scales; And lo! the Guard rose up, and round his foe, With gliding motion, wreath'd his lengthening coils, Then tighten'd all their folds with stress and strain. Nought would the raging Tyger's strength avail If once involved within those mighty toils; The arm'd Rhinoceros, so clasp'd, in vain Had trusted to his hide of rugged mail, His bones all broken, and the breath of life Crush'd from the lungs, in that unequal strife. Again, and yet again, he sought to break The impassive limbs; but when the Monster found His utmost power was vain, A moment he relax'd in every round, Then knit his coils again with closer strain, And, bearing forward, forced him to the ground. 16. Ereenia groan'd in anguish at the sight Of this dread fight: once more the Glendoveer Essay'd to break his bonds, and fear For that brave father who had sought him here, Stung him to wilder strugglings. From the rock He raised himself half up, with might and main Pluck'd at the adamantine chain, And now, with long and unrelaxing strain, In obstinate effort of indignant strength, Labour'd and strove in vain; Till his immortal sinews fail'd at length; And yielding, with an inward groan, to fate, Despairingly, he let himself again Fall prostrate on his prison-bed of stone, Body and chain alike with lifeless weight. 17. Struggling they lay in mortal fray All day, while day was in our upper sphere, For light of day And natural darkness never entered here; All night, with unabated might, They waged the unremitting fight. A second day, a second night, With furious will they wrestled still. The third came on, the fourth is gone; Another comes, another goes, And yet no respite, no repose! But day and night, and night and day, Involv'd in mortal strife they lay; Six days and nights have pass'd away, And still they wage, with mutual rage, The unremitting fray. With mutual rage their war they wage, But not with mutual will; For when the seventh morning came, The monster's worn and wearied frame In this strange contest fails; And weaker, weaker, every hour, He yields beneath strong Nature's power, For now the Curse prevails. 18. Sometimes the Beast sprung up to bear His foe aloft; and trusting there To shake him from his hold, Relax'd the rings that wreath'd him round; But on his throat Ladurlad hung And weigh'd him to the ground; And if they sink, or if they float, Alike with stubborn clasp he clung, Tenacious of his grasp; For well he knew with what a power, Exempt from Nature's laws, The Curse had arm'd him for this hour; And in the monster's gasping jaws, And in his hollow eye, Well could Ladurlad now descry The certain signs of victory. 19. And now the Beast no more can keep His painful watch; his eyes, opprest, Are fainting for their natural sleep; His living flesh and blood must rest, The Beast must sleep or die. Then he, full faint and languidly, Unwreathes his rings and strives to fly, And still retreating, slowly trails His stiff and heavy length of scales. But that unweariable foe, With will relentless follows still; No breathing time, no pause of fight He gives, but presses on his flight; Along the vaulted chambers, and the ascent Up to the emerald-tinted light of day, He harasses his way, Till lifeless, underneath his grasp, The huge Sea-Monster lay. 20. That obstinate work is done; Ladurlad cried, One labour yet remains! And thoughtfully he eyed Ereenia's ponderous chains; And with faint effort, half-despairing, tried The rivets deep in-driven. Instinctively, As if in search of aid, he look'd around: Oh, then how gladly, in the near alcove, Fallen on the ground its lifeless Lord beside, The crescent scymitar he spied, Whose cloudy blade, with potent spells imbued, Had lain so many an age unhurt in solitude. 21. Joyfully springing there He seized the weapon, and with eager stroke Hew'd at the chain; the force was dealt in vain, For not as if through yielding air Pass'd the descending scymitar, Its deaden'd way the heavy water broke; Yet it bit deep. Again, with both his hands, He wields the blade, and dealt a surer blow. The baser metal yields To that fine edge, and lo! the Glendoveer Rises and snaps the half-sever'd links, and stands Freed from his broken bands. XVII. BALY. 1. This is the appointed night, The night of joy and consecrated mirth, When from his judgement-seat in Padalon, By Yamen's throne, Baly goes forth, that he may walk the Earth Unseen, and hear his name Still hymn'd and honour'd by the grateful voice Of humankind, and in his fame rejoice. Therefore from door to door, and street to street, With willing feet, Shaking their firebrands, the glad children run; Baly! great Baly! they acclaim, Where'er they run they bear the mighty name, Where'er they meet, Baly! great Baly! still their choral tongues repeat. Therefore at every door the votive flame Through pendant lanterns sheds its painted light, And rockets hissing upward through the sky, Fall like a shower of stars From Heaven's black canopy. Therefore, on yonder mountain's templed height, The brazen caldron blazes through the night. Huge as a Ship that travels the main sea Is that capacious brass; its wick as tall As is the mast of some great admiral. Ten thousand votaries bring Camphor and ghee to feed the sacred flame; And while, through regions round, the nations see Its fiery pillar curling high in heaven, Baly! great Baly! they exclaim, For ever hallowed be his blessed name! Honour and praise to him for ever more be given! 2. Why art not thou among the festive throng, Baly, O righteous Judge! to hear thy fame? Still, as of yore, with pageantry and song, The glowing streets along, They celebrate thy name; Baly! great Baly! still The grateful habitants of Earth acclaim, Baly! great Baly! still The ringing walls and echoing towers proclaim. From yonder mountain the portentous flame Still blazes to the nations as before; All things appear to human eyes the same, As perfect as of yore; To human eyes, . . . but how unlike to thine! Thine which were wont to see The Company divine, That with their presence came to honour thee! For all the blessed ones of mortal birth Who have been clothed with immortality, From the eight corners of the Earth, From the Seven Worlds assembling, all Wont to attend thy solemn festival. Then did thine eyes behold The wide air peopled with that glorious train; Now may'st thou seek the blessed ones in vain, For Earth and Air are now beneath the Rajah's reign. 3. Therefore the righteous Judge hath walk'd the Earth In sorrow and in solitude to-night. The sound of human mirth To him is no delight; He turns away from that ungrateful sight, Hallowed not now by visitants divine, And there he bends his melancholy way Where, in yon full-orb'd Moon's refulgent light, The Golden Towers of his old City shine Above the silver sea. The ancient Chief There bent his way in grief, As if sad thoughts indulged would work their own relief. 4. There he beholds upon the sand A lovely Maiden in the moonlight stand. The land-breeze lifts her locks of jet, The waves around her polish'd ankles play, Her bosom with the salt sea-spray is wet; Her arms are cross'd, unconsciously, to fold That bosom from the cold, While statue-like she seems her watch to keep, Gazing intently on the restless deep. 5. Seven miserable days had Kailyal there, From earliest dawn till evening watch'd the deep; Six nights within the chamber of the rock, Had laid her down, and found in prayer That comfort which she sought in vain from sleep. But when the seventh night came, Never should she behold her father more, The wretched Maiden said in her despair; Yet would not quit the shore, Nor turn her eyes one moment from the sea: Never before Had Kailyal watch'd it so impatiently, Never so eagerly had hoped before, As now when she believed, and said all hope was o'er. 6. Beholding her, how beautiful she stood, In that wild solitude, Baly from his invisibility Had issued then, to know her cause of woe; But that in the air beside her, he espied Two Powers of Evil for her hurt allied, Foul Arvalan and dreadful Lorrinite. Walking in darkness him they could not see, And marking with what demon-like delight They kept their innocent prey in sight, He waits, expecting what the end may be. 7. She starts; for lo! where floating many a rood, A Monster, hugest of the Ocean brood, Weltering and lifeless, drifts toward the shore. Backward she starts in fear before the flood, And, when the waves retreat, They leave their hideous burthen at her feet. 8. She ventures to approach with timid tread, She starts, and half draws back in fear, Then stops, and stretches out her head, To see if that huge Beast indeed be dead. Now growing bold, the Maid advances near, Even to the margin of the ocean-flood. Rightly she reads her Father's victory, And lifts her joyous hands exultingly To Heaven in gratitude. Then spreading them toward the Sea, While pious tears bedim her streaming eyes, Come! come! my Father, come to me, Ereenia, come! she cries, Lo! from the opening deep they rise, And to Ladurlad's arms the happy Kailyal flies. 9. She turn'd from him, to meet with beating heart, The Glendoveer's embrace. Now turn to me, for mine thou art! Foul Arvalan exclaim'd; his loathsome face Came forth, and from the air, In fleshly form, he burst. Always in horror and despair, Had Kailyal seen that form and face accurst, But yet so sharp a pang had ne'er Shot with a thrill like death through all her frame, As now when on her hour of joy the Spectre came. 10. Vain is resistance now, The fiendish laugh of Lorrinite is heard; And at her dreadful word, The Asuras once again appear, And seize Ladurlad and the Glendoveer. 11. Hold your accursed hands! A voice exclaim'd, whose dread commands Were fear'd through all the vaults of Padalon; And there among them, in the midnight air, The presence of the mighty Baly shone. He, making manifest his mightiness, Put forth on every side an hundred arms, And seized the Sorceress; maugre all her charms, Her and her fiendish ministers he caught With force as uncontroulable as fate; And that unhappy Soul, to whom The Almighty Rajah's power availeth not Living to avert, nor dead to mitigate His righteous doom. 12. Help, help, Kehama! Father, help! he cried, But Baly tarried not to abide That mightier Power; with irresistible feet He stampt and cleft the Earth; it open'd wide, And gave him way to his own Judgement-seat. Down, like a plummet, to the World below He sunk, and bore his prey To punishment deserved, and endless woe. XVIII. KEHAMA'S DESCENT. 1. The Earth, by Baly's feet divided, Closed o'er his way as to the Judgement-seat He plunged and bore his prey. Scarce had the shock subsided, When, darting from the Swerga's heavenly heights, Kehama, like a thunderbolt, alights. In wrath he came, a bickering flame Flash'd from his eyes which made the moonlight dim, And passion forcing way from every limb, Like furnace-smoke, with terrors wrapt him round. Furious he smote the ground; Earth trembled underneath the dreadful stroke, Again in sunder riven; He hurl'd in rage his whirling weapon down. But lo! the fiery sheckra to his feet Return'd, as if by equal force re-driven, And from the abyss the voice of Baly came: Not yet, O Rajah, hast thou won The realms of Padalon! Earth and the Swerga are thine own, But, till Kehama shall subdue the throne Of Hell, in torments Yamen holds his son. 2. Fool that he is! . . . in torments let him lie! Kehama, wrathful at his son, replied. But what am I, That thou should'st brave me? . . kindling in his pride The dreadful Rajah cried. Ho! Yamen! hear me. God of Padalon, Prepare thy throne, And let the Amreeta cup Be ready for my lips, when I anon Triumphantly shall take my seat thereon, And plant upon thy neck my royal feet. 3. In voice like thunder thus the Rajah cried, Impending o'er the abyss, with menacing hand Put forth, as in the action of command, And eyes that darted their red anger down. Then drawing back he let the earth subside, And, as his wrath relax'd, survey'd, Thoughtfully and silently, the mortal Maid. Her eye the while was on the farthest sky, Where up the ethereal height Ereenia rose and pass'd away from sight. Never had she so joyfully Beheld the coming of the Glendoveer, Dear as he was and he deserved to be, As now she saw him rise and disappear. Come now what will, within her heart said she, For thou art safe, and what have I to fear? 4. Meantime the Almighty Rajah, late In power and majesty and wrath array'd, Had laid his terrors by And gazed upon the Maid. Pride could not quit his eye, Nor that remorseless nature from his front Depart; yet whoso had beheld him then Had felt some admiration mix'd with dread, And might have said, That sure he seem'd to be the King' of Men! Less than the greatest that he could not be, Who carried in his port such might and majesty. 5. In fear no longer for the Glendoveer, Now toward the Rajah Kailyal turn'd her eyes As if to ask what doom awaited her. But then surprise, Even as with fascination held them there, So strange a thing it seem'd to see the change Of purport in that all-commanding brow, Which thoughtfully was bent upon her now. Wondering she gazed, the while her Father's eye Was fix'd upon Kehama haughtily; It spake defiance to him, high disdain, Stern patience unsubduable by pain, And pride triumphant over agony. 6. Ladurlad, said the Rajah, thou and I Alike have done the work of Destiny, Unknowing each to what the impulse tended; But now that over Earth and Heaven my reign Is stablish'd, and the ways of Fate are plain Before me, here our enmity is ended. I take away thy Curse... As thus he said, The fire which in Ladurlad's heart and brain Was burning, fled, and left him free from pain. So rapidly his torments were departed, That at the sudden ease he started, As with a shock, and to his head His hands up-fled, As if he felt through every failing limb The power and sense of life forsaking him. 7. Then turning to the Maid, the Rajah cried, O Virgin, above all of mortal birth Favour'd alike in beauty and in worth, And in the glories of thy destiny, Now let thy happy heart exult with pride, For Fate hath chosen thee To be Kehama's bride, To be the Queen of Heaven and Earth, And of whatever Worlds beside Infinity may hide... For I can see The writing which, at thy nativity, All-knowing Nature wrought upon thy brain, In branching veins, which to the gifted eye Map out the mazes of futurity. There is it written, Maid, that thou and I, Alone of human kind a deathless pair, Are doom'd to share The Amreeta-drink divine Of immortality. Come, Maiden mine! High-fated One, ascend the subject sky, And by Kehama's side Sit on the Swerga throne, his equal bride. 8. Oh never, . . never, . . Father! Kailyal cried; It is not as he saith, . . it cannot be! I! . . I, his bride! Nature is never false; he wrongeth her! My heart belies such lines of destiny. There is no other true interpreter! 9. At that reply, Kehama's darkening brow Bewray'd the anger which he yet suppress'd; Counsel thy daughter! tell her thou art now Free from thy Curse, he said, and bid her bow In thankfulness to Fate's benign behest. Bid her her stubborn will restrain, For Destiny at last must be obey'd, And tell her, while obedience is delay'd, Thy Curse will burn again. 10. She needeth not my counsel, he replied, And idly, Rajah, dost thou reason thus Of destiny! for though all other things Were subject to the starry influencings, And bow'd submissive to thy tyranny, The virtuous heart and resolute mind are free. Thus in their wisdom did the Gods decree When they created man. Let come what will, This is our rock of strength; in every ill, Sorrow, oppression, pain and agony, The spirit of the good is unsubdued, And suffer, as they may, they triumph still. 11. Obstinate fools! exclaim'd the Mighty One, Fate and my pleasure must be done, And ye resist in vain! Take your fit guerdon till we meet again! So saying, his vindictive hand he flung Towards them, fill'd with curses; then on high Aloft he sprung, and vanish'd through the Sky. XIX. MOUNT CALASAY. 1. The Rajah, scattering curses as he rose, Soar'd to the Swerga, and resumed his throne. Not for his own redoubled agony, Which now through heart and brain With renovated pain, Rush'd to its seat, Ladurlad breathes that groan, That groan is for his child; he groan'd to see That she was stricken now with leprosy, Which as the enemy vindictive fled, O'er all her frame with quick contagion spread. She, wondering at events so passing strange, And fill'd with hope and fear, And joy to see the Tyrant disappear, And glad expectance of her Glendoveer, Perceived not in herself the hideous change. His burning pain, she thought, had forced the groan Her father breathed; his agonies alone Were present to her mind; she clasp'd his knees, Wept for his Curse, and did not feel her own. 2. Nor when she saw her plague, did her good heart, True to itself, even for a moment fail. Ha, Rajah! with disdainful smile she cries, Mighty and wise and wicked as thou art, Still thy blind vengeance acts a friendly part. Shall I not thank thee for this scurf and scale Of dire deformity, whose loathsomeness, Surer than panoply of strongest mail, Arms me against all foes? Oh, better so, Better such foul disgrace, Than that this innocent face Should tempt thy wooing! That I need not dread; Nor ever impious foe Will offer outrage now, nor farther woe Will beauty draw on my unhappy head, Safe through the unholy world may Kailyal go. 3. Her face in virtuous pride Was lifted to the skies, As him and his poor vengeance she defied; But earthward, when she ceased, she turn'd her eyes, As if she sought to hide The tear which in her own despite would rise. Did then the thought of her own Glendoveer Call forth that natural tear? Was it a woman's fear, A thought of earthly love which troubled her? Like yon thin cloud amid the moonlight sky That flits before the wind And leaves no trace behind, The womanly pang pass'd over Kailyal's mind. This is a loathsome sight to human eye, Half-shrinking at herself, the Maiden thought; Will it be so to him? Oh surely not! The immortal Powers, who see Through the poor wrappings of mortality, Behold the soul, the beautiful soul, within, Exempt from age and wasting maladies, And undeform'd, while pure and free from sin. This is a loathsome sight to human eyes, But not to eyes divine, Ereenia, Son of Heaven, oh not to thine! 4. The wrongful thought of fear, the womanly pain Had pass'd away, her heart was calm again. She raised her head, expecting now to see The Glendoveer appear; Where hath he fled, quoth she, That he should tarry now? Oh! had she known Whither the adventurous Son of Heaven was flown, Strong as her spirit was, it had not borne The appalling thought, nor dared to hope for his return. 5. For he in search of Seeva's throne was gone, To tell his tale of wrong; In search of Seeva's own abode The Glendoveer began his heavenly road. O wild emprize! above the farthest skies He hoped to rise! Him who is throned beyond the reach of thought, The Alone, the Inaccessible, he sought. O wild emprize! for when in days of yore, For proud pre-eminence of power, Brama and Veeshnoo, wild with rage, contended, And Seeva in his might, Their dread contention ended; Before their sight In form a fiery column did he tower, Whose head above the highest height extended, Whose base below the deepest depth descended. Downward, its depth to sound Veeshnoo a thousand years explored The fathomless profound, And yet no base he found: Upward, to reach its head, Ten myriad years the aspiring Brama soar'd, And still, as up he fled, Above him still the Immeasurable spread. The rivals own'd their Lord, And trembled and adored. How shall the Glendoveer attain What Brama and what Veeshnoo sought in vain? 6. Ne'er did such thought of lofty daring enter Celestial Spirit's mind. O wild adventure That throne to find, for he must leave behind This World, that in the centre, Within its salt-sea girdle, lies confined; Yea the Seven Earths that, each with its own ocean, Ring clasping ring, compose the mighty round. What power of motion, In less than endless years shall bear him there, Along the limitless extent, To the utmost bound of the remotest spheres? What strength of wing Suffice to pierce the Golden Firmament That closes all within? Yet he hath pass'd the measureless extent And pierced the Golden Firmament; For Faith hath given him power, and Space and Time Vanish before that energy sublime. Nor doth eternal Night And outer Darkness check his resolute flight; By strong desire through all he makes his way, Till Seeva's Seat appears, . . behold Mount Calasay! 7. Behold the Silver Mountain! round about Seven ladders stand, so high, the aching eye, Seeking their tops in vain amid the sky, Might deem they led from earth to highest Heaven. Ages would pass away, And worlds with age decay, Ere one whose patient feet from ring to ring Must win their upward way, Could reach the summit of Mount Calasay. But that strong power that nerved his wing, That all-surmounting will, Intensity of faith and holiest love, Sustain'd Ereenia still, And he hath gain'd the plain, the sanctuary above. 8. Lo, there the Silver Bell, That, self-sustain'd, hangs buoyant in the air! Lo! the broad Table there, too bright For mortal sight, From whose four sides the bordering gems unite Their harmonising rays, In one mid fount of many-colour'd light. The stream of splendour, flashing as it flows, Plays round, and feeds the stem of yon celestial Rose! Where is the Sage whose wisdom can declare The hidden things of that mysterious flower, That flower which serves all mysteries to bear? The sacred Triangle is there, Holding the Emblem which no tongue may tell; Is this the Heaven of Heavens, where Seeva's self doth dwell? 9. Here first the Glendoveer Felt his wing flag, and paused upon his flight. Was it that fear came over him, when here He saw the imagined throne appear? Not so, for his immortal sight Endured the Table's light; Distinctly he beheld all things around, And doubt and wonder rose within his mind That this was all he found. Howbeit he lifted up his voice and spake. There is oppression in the World below; Earth groans beneath the yoke; yea, in her woe, She asks if the Avenger's eye is blind? Awake, O Lord, Awake! Too long thy vengeance sleepeth. Holiest One! Put thou thy terrors on for mercy's sake, And strike the blow, in justice to mankind! 10. So as he pray'd, intenser faith he felt, His spirit seem'd to melt With ardent yearnings of increasing love; Upward he turn'd his eyes As if there should be something yet above; Let me not, Seeva! seek in vain! he cries; Thou art not here, . . for how should these contain thee? Thou art not here, . . for how should I sustain thee? But thou, where'er thou art, Canst hear the voice of prayer, Canst read the righteous heart. Thy dwelling who can tell, Or who, O Lord, hath seen thy secret throne? But Thou art not alone, Not unapproachable! O all-containing Mind, Thou who art every where, Whom all who seek shall find, Hear me, O Seeva! hear the suppliant's prayer! 11. So saying, up he sprung, And struck the Bell, which self-suspended hung Before the mystic Rose. From side to side the silver tongue Melodious swung, and far and wide Soul-thrilling tones of heavenly music rung. Abash'd, confounded, It left the Glendoveer; . . . yea all astounded In overpowering fear and deep dismay; For when that Bell had sounded, The Rose, with all the mysteries it surrounded, The Bell, the Table, and Mount Calasay, The holy Hill itself with all thereon, Even as a morning dream before the day Dissolves away, they faded and were gone. 12. Where shall he rest his wing, where turn for flight, For all around is Light, Primal, essential, all-pervading Light! Heart cannot think, nor tongue declare, Nor eyes of Angel bear That Glory unimaginably bright; The Sun himself had seem'd A speck of darkness there, Amid that Light of Light! 13. Down fell the Glendoveer, Down through all regions, to our mundane sphere He fell; but in his ear A Voice, which from within him came, was heard, The indubitable word Of Him to whom all secret things are known: Go, ye who suffer, go to Yamen's throne. He hath the remedy for every woe; He setteth right whate'er is wrong below. XX. THE EMBARKATION. 1. Down from the Heaven of Heavens Ereenia fell Precipitate, yet imperceptible His fall, nor had he cause nor thought of fear; And when he came within this mundane sphere, And felt that Earth was near, The Glendoveer his azure wings expanded, And, sloping down the sky Toward the spot from whence he sprung on high, There on the shore he landed. 2. Kailyal advanced to meet him, Not moving now as she was wont to greet him, Joy in her eye and in her eager pace; With a calm smile of melancholy pride She met him now, and turning half aside, Her warning hand repell'd the dear embrace. 3. Strange things, Ereenia, have befallen us here, The Virgin said; the Almighty Man hath read The lines which, traced by Nature on my brain, There to the gifted eye Make all my fortunes plain, Mapping the mazes of futurity. He sued for peace, for it is written there That I with him the Amreeta cup must share; Wherefore he bade me come, and by his side Sit on the Swerga-throne, his equal bride. I need not tell thee what reply was given; My heart, the sure interpreter of Heaven, His impious words belied. Thou seest his poor revenge! So having said, One look she glanced upon her leprous stain Indignantly, and shook Her head in calm disdain. 4. O Maid of soul divine! O more than ever dear, And more than ever mine, Replied the Glendoveer; He hath not read, be sure, the mystic ways Of Fate; almighty as he is, that maze Hath mock'd his fallible sight. Said he the Amreeta-cup? So far aright The Evil One may see; for Fate displays Her hidden things in part, and part conceals, Baffling the wicked eye Alike with what she hides, and what reveals, When with unholy purpose it would pry Into the secrets of futurity. So may it be permitted him to see Dimly the inscrutable decree; For to the World below, Where Yamen guards the Amreeta, we must go; Thus Seeva hath exprest his will, even he The Holiest hath ordain'd it; there, he saith, All wrongs shall be redrest By Yamen, by the righteous Power of Death. 5. Forthwith the Father and the fated Maid, And that heroic Spirit, who for them Such flight had late essay'd, The will of Heaven obey'd. They went their way along the road That leads to Yamen's dread abode. 6. Many a day hath pass'd away Since they began their arduous way, Their way of toil and pain; And now their weary feet attain The Earth's remotest bound, Where outer Ocean girds it round. But not like other Oceans this; Rather it seem'd a drear abyss, Upon whose brink they stood. Oh! scene of fear! the travellers hear The raging of the flood; They hear how fearfully it roars, But clouds of darker shade than night For ever hovering round those shores, Hide all things from their sight; The Sun upon that darkness pours His unavailing light, Nor ever Moon nor Stars display, Through the thick shade, one guiding ray To show the perils of the way. 7. There in a creek a vessel lay, Just on the confines of the day, It rode at anchor in its bay, These venturous pilgrims to convey Across that outer Sea. Strange vessel sure it seem'd to be, And all unfit for such wild sea! For through its yawning side the wave Was oozing in; the mast was frail, And old and torn its only sail. How may that crazy vessel brave The billows that in wild commotion For ever roar and rave? How hope to cross the dreadful Ocean O'er which eternal shadows dwell, Whose secrets none return to tell! 8. Well might the travellers fear to enter! But summon'd once on that adventure, For them was no retreat. Nor boots it with reluctant feet To linger on the strand; Aboard! aboard! An aweful voice, that left no choice, Sent forth its stern command, Aboard! aboard! The travellers hear that voice in fear, And breathe to Heaven an inward prayer, And take their seats in silence there. 9. Self hoisted then, behold the sail Expands itself before the gale; Hands which they cannot see, let slip The cable of that fated ship; The land breeze sends her on her way, And lo! they leave the living light of day! XXI. THE WORLD'S END. 1. Swift as an arrow in its flight The Ship shot through the incumbent night; And they have left behind The raging billows and the roaring wind, The storm, the darkness, and all mortal fears; And lo! another light To guide their way appears, The light of other spheres. 2. That instant from Ladurlad's heart and brain The Curse was gone; he feels again Fresh as in youth's fair morning, and the Maid Hath lost her leprous stain. The Tyrant then hath no dominion here, Starting she cried; O happy, happy hour! We are beyond his power! Then raising to the Glendoveer, With heavenly beauty bright, her angel face, Turn'd not reluctant now, and met his dear embrace. 3. Swift glides the Ship with gentle motion Across that calm and quiet ocean; That glassy sea which seem'd to be The mirror of tranquillity. Their pleasant passage soon was o'er, The Ship hath reach'd its destined shore; A level belt of ice which bound, As with an adamantine mound, The waters of the sleeping Ocean round. Strange forms were on the strand Of earth-born spirits slain before their time; Who wandering over sea and sky and land, Had so fulfill'd their term; and now were met Upon this icey belt, a motley band, Waiting their summons at the appointed hour, When each before the Judgement-seat must stand, And hear his doom from Baly's righteous power. 4. Foul with habitual crimes, a hideous crew Were there, the race of rapine and of blood. Now having overpass'd the mortal flood, Their own deformity they knew, And knew the meed that to their deeds was due. Therefore in fear and agony they stood, Expecting when the Evil Messenger Among them should appear. But with their fear A hope was mingled now; O'er the dark shade of guilt a deeper hue It threw, and gave a fiercer character To the wild eye and lip and sinful brow. They hoped that soon Kehama would subdue The inexorable God and seize his throne, Reduce the infernal World to his command, And with his irresistible right hand, Redeem them from the vaults of Padalon. 5. Apart from these a milder company, The victims of offences not their own, Look'd when the appointed Messenger should come; Gather'd together some, and some alone Brooding in silence on their future doom. Widows whom, to their husbands' funeral fire, Force or strong error led, to share the pyre, As to their everlasting marriage-bed: And babes, by sin unstain'd, Whom erring parents vow'd To Ganges, and the holy stream profaned With that strange sacrifice, rite unordain'd By Law, by sacred Nature unallow'd: Others more hapless in their destiny, Scarce having first inhaled their vital breath, Whose cradles from some tree Unnatural hands suspended, Then left, till gentle Death, Coming like Sleep, their feeble moanings ended; Or for his prey the ravenous Kite descended; Or marching like an army from their caves, The Pismires blacken'd o'er, then bleach'd and bare Left their unharden'd bones to fall asunder there. 6. Innocent Souls! thus set so early free From sin and sorrow and mortality, Their spotless spirits all-creating Love Received into its universal breast. Yon blue serene above Was their domain; clouds pillow'd them to rest; The Elements on them like nurses tended, And with their growth etherial substance blended. Less pure than these is that strange Indian bird, Who never dips in earthly streams her bill, But, when the sound of coming showers is heard, Looks up, and from the clouds receives her fill. Less pure the footless fowl of Heaven, that never Rest upon earth, but on the wing for ever Hovering o'er flowers, their fragrant food inhale, Drink the descending dew upon its way, And sleep aloft while floating on the gale. 7. And thus these innocents in yonder sky Grow and are strengthen'd, while the allotted years Perform their course; then hitherward they fly, Being free from moral taint, so free from fears, A joyous band, expecting soon to soar To Indra's happy spheres, And mingle with the blessed company Of heavenly spirits there for ever more. 8. A Gulph profound surrounded This icey belt; the opposite side With highest rocks was bounded; But where their heads they hide, Or where their base is founded, None could espy. Above all reach of sight They rose, the second Earth was on their height, Their feet were fix'd in everlasting night. 9. So deep the Gulph, no eye Could plum its dark profundity, Yet all its depth must try; for this the road To Padalon, and Yamen's dread abode. And from below continually Ministrant Demons rose and caught The Souls whose hour was come; Then with their burthen fraught, Plunged down, and bore them to receive their doom. 10. Then might be seen who went in hope, and who Trembled to meet the meed Of many a foul misdeed, as wild they threw Their arms retorted from the Demons' grasp, And look'd around, all eagerly, to seek For help, where help was none; and strove for aid To clasp the nearest shade; Yea, with imploring looks and horrent shriek, Even from one Demon to another bending, With hands extending, Their mercy they essay'd. Still from the verge they strain, And from the dreadful gulph avert their eyes, In vain; down plunge the Demons, and their cries Feebly, as down they sink, from that profound arise. 11. What heart of living man could undisturb'd, Bear sight so sad as this! What wonder there If Kailyal's lip were blanch'd with inmost dread! The chill which from that icey belt Struck through her, was less keen than what she felt With her heart's blood through every limb dispread. Close to the Glendoveer she clung, And clasping round his neck her trembling hands, She closed her eyes, and there in silence hung. 12. Then to Ladurlad said the Glendoveer, These Demons, whom thou seest, the ministers Of Yamen, wonder to behold us here; But for the dead they come, and not for us: Therefore albeit they gaze upon thee thus, Have thou no fear. A little while thou must be left alone, Till I have borne thy daughter down, And placed her safely by the throne Of him who keeps the Gate of Padalon. 13. Then taking Kailyal in his arms, he said, Be of good heart, Beloved! it is I Who bear thee. Saying this, his wings he spread, Sprung upward in the sky, and poised his flight, Then plunged into the Gulph, and sought the World of Night. XXII. THE GATE OF PADALON. 1. The strong foundations of this inmost Earth Rest upon Padalon. That icey Mound Which girt the mortal Ocean round, Reach'd the profound, . . . Ice in the regions of the upper air, Crystal midway, and adamant below, Whose strength sufficed to bear The weight of all this upper World of ours, And with its rampart closed the Realm of Woe. Eight gates hath Padalon; eight heavenly Powers Have them in charge, each alway at his post, Lest from their penal caves the accursed host, Maugre the might of Baly and the God, Should break, and carry ruin all abroad. 2. Those gates stand ever open, night and day, And Souls of mortal men For ever throng the way. Some from the dolorous den, Children of sin and wrath, return no more: They, fit companions of the Spirits accurst, Are doom'd, like them in baths of fire immerst, Or weltering upon beds of molten ore, Or stretch'd upon the brazen floor, Are fasten'd down with adamantine chains; While on their substance inconsumable, Leeches of fire for ever hang and pull, And worms of fire for ever gnaw their food, That, still renew'd, Freshens for ever their perpetual pains. 3. Others there were whom Baly's voice condemn'd, By long and painful penance, to atone Their fleshly deeds. Them, from the Judgement-Throne, Dread Azyoruca, where she sat involved In darkness as a tent, received, and dealt To each the measure of his punishment; Till, in the central springs of fire, the Will Impure is purged away; and the freed soul, Thus fitted to receive a second birth, Embodied once again, revisits Earth. 4. But they whom Baly's righteous voice absolved, And Yamen, viewing with benignant eye, Dismiss'd to seek their heritage on high, How joyfully they leave this gloomy bourne, The dread sojourn Of Guilt and twin-born Punishment and Woe, And wild Remorse, here link'd with worse Despair! They to the eastern Gate rejoicing go: The Ship of Heaven awaits their coming there, And on they sail, greeting the blessed light Through realms of upper air, Bound for the Swerga once; but now no more Their voyage rests upon that happy shore, Since Indra, by the dreadful Rajah's might Compell'd, hath taken flight; On to the second World their way they wend, And there, in trembling hope, await the doubtful end. 5. For still in them doth hope predominate, Faith's precious privilege, when higher Powers Give way to fear in these portentous hours. Behold the Wardens eight Each silent at his gate Expectant stands; they turn their anxious eyes Within, and, listening to the dizzy din Of mutinous uproar, each in all his hands Holds all his weapons, ready for the fight. For, hark! what clamorous cries Upon Kehama, for deliverance, call! Come, Rajah! they exclaim, too long we groan In torments. Come, Deliverer! yonder throne A waits thee... Now, Kehama! Rajah, now! Earthly Almighty, wherefore tarriest thou? . . Such were the sounds that rung, in wild uproar, O'er all the echoing vaults of Padalon; And as the Asuras from the Brazen floor, Struggling against their fetters, strove to rise, Their clashing chains were heard, and shrieks and cries, With curses mix'd, against the Fiends who urge, Fierce on their rebel limbs, the avenging scourge. 6. These were the sounds which, at the southern gate, Assail'd Ereenia's ear; alighting here He laid before Neroodi's feet the Maid Who pale and cold with fear, Hung on his neck, well-nigh a lifeless weight. 7. Who and what art thou? cried the Guardian Power, Sight so unwonted wondering to behold, . . O Son of Light! Who comest here at this portentous hour, When Yamen's throne Trembles, and all our might can scarce keep down The rebel race from seizing Padalon, . . . Who and what art thou? and what wild despair, Or wilder hope, from realms of upper air, Tempts thee to bear This mortal Maid to our forlorn abodes? Fitter for her, I ween, the Swerga bowers, And sweet society of heavenly Powers, Than this, . . a doleful scene, Even in securest hours. And whither would ye go? Alas! can human or celestial ear, Unmadden'd, hear The shrieks and yellings of infernal woe? Can living flesh and blood Endure the passage of the fiery flood! 8. Lord of the Gate, replied the Glendoveer, We come obedient to the will of Fate; And haply doom'd to bring Hope and salvation to the Infernal King, For Seeva sends us here, Even He to whom futurity is known, The Holiest, bade us go to Yamen's throne. Thou seest my precious charge; Under thy care, secure from harm, I leave her, While I ascend to bear her father down. Beneath the shelter of thine arm receive her! 9. Then quoth he to the Maid, Be of good cheer, my Kailyal! dearest dear, In faith subdue thy dread; Anon I shall be here. So having said, Aloft with vigorous bound the Glendoveer, Sprung in celestial might, And soaring up, in spiral circles, wound His indefatigable flight. 10. But as he thus departed, The Maid, who at Neroodi's feet was lying, Like one entranced or dying, Recovering strength from sudden terror, started; And gazing after him with straining sight, And straining arms, she stood, As if in attitude To win him back from flight. Yea, she had shaped his name For utterance, to recall and bid him stay, Nor leave her thus alone; but virtuous shame Represt the unbidden sounds upon their way; And calling faith to aid, Even in this fearful hour, the pious Maid Collected courage, till she seem'd to be Calm and in hope, such power hath piety. Before the Giant Keeper of the Gate She crost her patient arms, and at his feet, Prepar'd to meet The aweful will of Fate with equal mind, She took her seat resign'd. 11. Even the stern trouble of Neroodi's brow Relax'd as he beheld the valiant Maid. Hope, long unfelt till now, Rose in his heart reviving, and a smile Dawn'd in his brightening countenance, the while He gazed on her with wonder and delight. The blessing of the Powers of Padalon, Virgin, be on thee! said the admiring God; And blessed be the hour that gave thee birth, Daughter of Earth! For thou to this forlorn abode hast brought Hope, who too long hath been a stranger here. And surely for no lamentable lot, Nature that erreth not, To thee that heart of fortitude hath given, Those eyes of purity, that face of love: . . . If thou beëst not the inheritrix of Heaven, There is no truth above. 12. Thus as Neroodi spake, his brow severe Shone with an inward joy; for sure he thought When Seeva sent so fair a creature here, In this momentous hour, Ere long the World's deliverance would be wrought, And Padalon escape the Rajah's power. With pious mind the Maid, in humble guise Inclined, received his blessing silently, And raised her grateful eyes A moment, then again Abased them at his presence. Hark! on high The sound of coming wings! . . her anxious ears Have caught the distant sound. Ereenia brings His burthen down! Upstarting from her seat, How joyfully she rears Her eager head! and scarce upon the ground Ladurlad's giddy feet their footing found, When, with her trembling arms, she claspt him round. No word of greeting, Nor other sign of joy at that strange meeting; Expectant of their fate, Silent, and hand in hand, Before the Infernal Gate, The Father and his pious Daughter stand. 13. Then to Neroodi said the Glendoveer, No Heaven-born Spirit e'er hath visited This region drear and dread; but I, the first Who tread your World accurst. Lord of the Gate, to whom these realms are known, Direct our fated way to Yamen's throne. 14. Bring forth my Chariot, Carmala! quoth then The Keeper of the way. It was the Car wherein On Yamen's festal day, When all the Powers of Hell attend their King, Yearly to Yamenpur did he repair To pay his homage there. Poised on a single wheel, it mov'd along, Instinct with motion; by what wondrous skill Compact, no human tongue could tell, Nor human wit devise; but on that wheel, Moving or still, As if with life indued, The Car miraculous supported stood. 15. Then Carmala brought forth two mantles, white As the swan's breast, and bright as mountain snow, When from the wintry sky The sun, late-rising, shines upon the height, And rolling vapours fill the vale below. Not without pain the unaccustom'd sight That brightness could sustain; For neither mortal stain, Nor parts corruptible, remain, Nor aught that time could touch, or force destroy, In that pure web whereof the robes were wrought; So long had it in tenfold fires been tried, And blanch'd, and to that brightness purified. Apparell'd thus, alone, Children of Earth, Neroodi cried, In safety may ye pass to Yamen's throne. Thus only can your living flesh and blood Endure the passage of the fiery flood. 16. Of other frame, O son of Heaven, art thou! Yet hast thou now to go Through regions which thy heavenly mould will try. Glories unutterably bright, I know, And beams intense of empyrean light, Thine eye divine can bear: but fires of woe, The sight of torments, and the cry Of absolute despair, Might not these things dismay thee on thy flight, And they strong pennons flag and fail thee there? Trust not thy wings, celestial though thou art, Nor thy good heart, which horror might assail And pity quail, Pity in these abodes of no avail; But take thy seat this mortal pair beside, And Carmala the infernal Car will guide. Go, and may happy end your way betide! So, as he spake, the self-moved Car roll'd on, And lo! they pass the Gate of Padalon. XXIII. PADALON. 1. Whoe'er hath loved with venturous step to tread The chambers dread Of some deep cave, and seen his taper's beam Lost in the arch of darkness overhead, And mark'd its gleam, Playing afar upon the sunless stream, Where from their secret bed, And course unknown and inaccessible, The silent waters well; Whoe'er hath trod such caves of endless night, He knows, when measuring back the gloomy way, With what delight refresh'd his eye Perceives the shadow of the light of day, Through the far portal slanting, where it falls Dimly reflected on the watery walls; How heavenly seems the sky; And how, with quicken'd feet, he hastens up, Eager again to greet The living World and blessed sunshine there, And drink, as from a cup Of joy, with thirsty lips, the open air. 2. Far other light than that of day there shone Upon the travellers, entering Padalon. They too in darkness enter'd on their way, But far before the Car, A glow, as of a fiery furnace light, Fill'd all before them. 'Twas a light which made Darkness itself appear A thing of comfort, and the sight, dismay'd, Shrunk inward from the molten atmosphere. Their way was through the adamantine rock Which girt the World of Woe; on either side Its massive walls arose, and overhead Arch'd the long passage; onward as they ride, With stronger glare the light around them spread; And lo! the regions dread, The World of Woe before them, opening wide. 3. There rolls the fiery flood, Girding the realms of Padalon around. A sea of flame it seem'd to be, Sea without bound; For neither mortal nor immortal sight, Could pierce across through that intensest light. A single rib of steel, Keen as the edge of keenest scymitar, Spann'd this wide gulph of fire. The infernal Car Roll'd to the Gulph, and on its single wheel Self-balanced, rose upon that edge of steel. Red-quivering float the vapours overhead, The fiery gulph beneath them spread, Tosses its billowing blaze with rush and roar; Steady and swift the self-moved Chariot went, Winning the long ascent, Then, downward rolling, gains the farther shore. 4. But, oh! what sounds and sights of woe, What sights and sounds of fear, Assail the mortal travellers here! Their way was on a causey straight and wide, Where penal vaults on either side were seen, Ranged like the cells wherein Those wondrous winged alchemists infold Their stores of liquid gold. Thick walls of adamant divide The dungeons; and from yonder circling flood, Off-streams of fire through secret channels glide, And wind among them, and in each provide An everlasting food Of rightful torments for the accursed brood. 5. These were the rebel race, who in their might Confiding impiously, would fain have driven The Deities supreme from highest Heaven: But by the Suras, in celestial fight, Opposed and put to flight, Here, in their penal dens, the accursed crew, Not for its crime, but for its failure, rue Their wild ambition, Yet again they long The contest to renew, And wield their arms again in happier hour; And with united power, Following Kehama's triumph, to press on From World to World, and heaven to Heaven, and Sphere To Sphere, till Hemakoot shall be their own, And Meru-Mount, and Indra's Swerga-Bowers, And Brama's region, where the heavenly Hours Weave the vast circle of his age-long day. Even over Veeshnoo's empyreal seat They trust the Rajah shall extend their sway, And that the seven-headed Snake, whereon The strong Preserver sets his conquering feet, Will rise and shake him headlong from his throne, When, in their irresistible array, Amid the Milky Sea they force their way. Even higher yet their frantic thoughts aspire; Yea, on their beds of torment as they lie, The highest, holiest Seeva, they defy, And tell him they shall have anon their day, When they will storm his realm, and seize Mount Calasay. 6. Such impious hopes torment Their raging hearts, impious and impotent; And now, with unendurable desire And lust of vengeance, that, like inward fire, Doth aggravate their punishment, they rave Upon Kehama; him the accursed rout Acclaim; with furious cries and maddening shout They call on him to save; Kehama! they exclaim; Thundering the dreadful echo rolls about, And Hell's whole vault repeats Kehama's name. 7. Over these dens of punishment, the host Of Padalon maintain eternal guard, Keeping upon the walls their vigilant ward. At every angle stood A watch-tower, the decurion Demon's post, Where raised on high he view'd with sleepless eye His trust, that all was well. And over these, Such was the perfect discipline of Hell, Captains of fifties and of hundreds held Authority, each in his loftier tower; And chiefs of legions over them had power; And thus all Hell with towers was girt around. Aloft the brazen turrets shone In the red light of Padalon; And on the walls between, Dark moving, the infernal Guards were seen, Gigantic Demons, pacing to and fro; Who ever and anon, Spreading their crimson pennons, plunged below, Faster to rivet down the Asuras' chains, And with the snakey scourge and fiercer pains, Repress their rage rebellious. Loud around, In mingled sound, the echoing lash, the clash Of chains, the ponderous hammer's iron stroke, With execrations, groans, and shrieks and cries Combined, in one wild dissonance, arise; And through the din there broke, Like thunder heard through all the warring winds, The dreadful name. Kehama, still they rave, Hasten and save! Now, now, Deliverer! now, Kehama, now! Earthly Almighty, wherefore tarriest thou? 8. Oh, if that name abhorr'd, Thus utter'd, could well nigh Dismay the Powers of Hell, and daunt their Lord, How fearfully to Kailyal's ear it came! She, as the Car roll'd on its rapid way, Bent down her head, and closed her eyes for dread; And deafening, with strong effort from within, Her ears against the din, Cover'd and prest them close with both her hands. Sure if the mortal Maiden had not fed On heavenly food, and long been strengthened With heavenly converse for such end vouchsafed, Her human heart had fail'd, and she had died Beneath the horrors of this aweful hour. But Heaven supplied a power Beyond her earthly nature, to the measure Of need infusing strength; And Fate, whose secret and unerring pleasure Appointed all, decreed An ample meed and recompense at length. High-fated Maid, the righteous hour is nigh! The all-embracing Eye Of Retribution still beholdeth thee; Bear onward to the end, O Maid, courageously! 9. On roll'd the Car, and lo! afar Upon its height the towers of Yamenpur Rise on the astonish'd sight. Behold the infernal City, Yamen's seat Of empire, in the midst of Padalon, Where the eight causeys meet. There on a rock of adamant it stood, Resplendent far and wide, Itself of solid diamond edified, And all around it roll'd the fiery flood. Eight bridges arch'd the stream; huge piles of brass Magnificent, such structures as beseem The Seat and Capital of such great God, Worthy of Yamen's own august abode. A brazen tower and gateway at each end Of each was raised, where Giant Wardens stood, Station'd in arms the passage to defend, That never foe might cross the fiery flood. 10. Oh what a gorgeous sight it was to see The Diamond City blazing on its height With more than mid-sun splendour, by the light Of its own fiery river! Its towers and domes and pinnacles and spires Turrets and battlements, that flash and quiver Through the red restless atmosphere for ever; And hovering over head, The smoke and vapours of all Padalon, Fit firmament for such a world, were spread, With surge and swell, and everlasting motion, Heaving and opening like tumultuous ocean. 11. Nor were there wanting there Such glories as beseem'd such region well; For though with our blue heaven and genial air The firmament of Hell might not compare, As little might our earthly tempests vie With the dread storms of that infernal sky, Whose clouds of all metallic elements Sublimed were full. For, when its thunder broke, Not all the united World's artillery, In one discharge, could equal that loud stroke; And though the Diamond Towers and Battlements Stood firm upon their adamantine rock, Yet while it vollied round the vault of Hell, Earth's solid arch was shaken with the shock, And Cities in one mighty ruin fell. Through the red sky terrific meteors scour; Huge stones come hailing down; or sulphur-shower, Floating amid the lurid air like snow, Kindles in its descent, And with blue fire-drops rains on all below. At times the whole supernal element Igniting, burst in one vast sheet of flame, And roar'd as with the sound Of rushing winds, above, below, around; Anon the flame was spent, and overhead A heavy cloud of moving darkness spread. 12. Straight to the brazen bridge and gate The self-moved Chariot bears its mortal load. At sight of Carmala, On either side the Giant guards divide, And give the chariot way. Up yonder winding road it rolls along, Swift as the bittern soars on spiral wing, And lo! the Palace of the Infernal King! 13. Two forms inseparable in unity Hath Yamen; even as with hope or fear The Soul regardeth him doth he appear; For hope and fear At that dread hour, from ominous conscience spring, And err not in their bodings. Therefore some, They who polluted with offences come, Behold him as the King Of Terrors, black of aspect, red of eye, Reflecting back upon the sinful mind, Heighten'd with vengeance, and with wrath divine, Its own inborn deformity. But to the righteous Spirit how benign His aweful countenance, Where, tempering justice with parental love, Goodness and heavenly grace And sweetest mercy shine! Yet is he still Himself the same, one form, one face, one will; And these his twofold aspects are but one; And change is none In him, for change in Yamen could not be, The Immutable is he. 14. He sat upon a marble sepulchre Massive and huge, where at the Monarch's feet, The righteous Baly had his Judgement-seat. A Golden Throne before them vacant stood; Three human forms sustain'd its ponderous weight, With lifted hands outspread, and shoulders bow'd Bending beneath the load. A fourth was wanting. They were of the hue Of coals of fire; yet were they flesh and blood, And living breath they drew; And their red eye-balls roll'd with ghastly stare, As thus, for their misdeeds, they stood tormented there. 15. On steps of gold those living Statues stood, Who bore the Golden Throne. A cloud behind Immovable was spread; not all the light Of all the flames and fires of Padalon Could pierce its depth of night. There Azyoruca veil'd her aweful form In those eternal shadows: there she sate, And as the trembling Souls, who crowd around The Judgement-seat, received the doom of fate, Her giant arms, extending from the cloud, Drew them within the darkness. Moving out To grasp and bear away the innumerous rout, For ever and for ever thus were seen The thousand mighty arms of that dread Queen. 16. Here, issuing from the car, the Glendoveer Did homage to the God, then raised his head. Suppliants we come, he said, I need not tell thee by what wrongs opprest, For nought can pass on earth to thee unknown; Sufferers from tyranny we seek for rest, And Seeva bade us go to Yamen's throne; Here, he hath said, all wrongs shall be redrest. Yamen replied, Even now the hour draws near, When Fate its hidden ways will manifest. Not for light purpose would the Wisest send His suppliants here, when we, in doubt and fear, The awful issue of the hour attend. Wait ye in patience and in faith the end! XXIV. THE AMREETA. 1. So spake the King of Padalon, when, lo! The voice of lamentation ceas'd in Hell, And sudden silence all around them fell, Silence more wild and terrible Than all the infernal dissonance before. Through that portentous stillness, far away, Unwonted sounds were heard, advancing on And deepening on their way; For now the inexorable hour Was come, and, in the fullness of his power, Now that the dreadful rites had all been done, Kehama from the Swerga hastened down, To seize upon the throne of Padalon. 2. He came in all his might and majesty, With all his terrors clad, and all his pride; And, by the attribute of Deity, Which he had won from Heaven, self-multiplied, The Almighty Man appear'd on every side. In the same indivisible point of time, At the eight Gates he stood at once, and beat The Warden-Gods of Hell beneath his feet; Then, in his brazen Cars of triumph, straight, At the same moment, drove through every gate. By Aullays, hugest of created kind, Fiercest, and fleeter than the viewless wind, His Cars were drawn, ten yokes of ten abreast, . . What less sufficed for such almighty weight? Eight bridges from the fiery flood arose Growing before his way; and on he goes, And drives the thundering Chariot-wheels along, At once o'er all the roads of Padalon. 3. Silent and motionless remain The Asuras on their bed of pain, Waiting, with breathless hope, the great event. All Hell was hush'd in dread, Such awe that omnipresent coming spread; Nor had its voice been heard, though all its rout Innumerable had lifted up one shout; Nor if the infernal firmament Had in one unimaginable burst Spent its collected thunders, had the sound Been audible, such louder terrors went Before his forms substantial. Round about The presence scattered lightnings far and wide, That quench'd on every side, With their intensest blaze, the feebler fire Of Padalon, even as the stars go out, When, with prodigious light, Some blazing meteor fills the astonish'd night. 4. The Diamond City shakes! The adamantine Rock Is loosen'd with the shock! From its foundation moved, it heaves and quakes; The brazen portals crumbling fall to dust; Prone fall the Giant Guards Beneath the Aullays crush'd; On, on, through Yamenpur, their thundering feet Speed from all points to Yamen's Judgement-seat. And lo! where multiplied, Behind, before him, and on every side, Wielding all weapons in his countless hands, Around the Lord of Hell Kehama stands! Then too the Lord of Hell put forth his might: Thick darkness, blacker than the blackest night, Rose from their wrath, and veil'd The unutterable fight. The power of Fate and Sacrifice prevail'd, And soon the strife was done. Then did the Man-God re-assume His unity, absorbing into one The consubstantiate shapes; and as the gloom Opened, fallen Yamen on the ground was seen, His neck beneath the conquering Rajah's feet, Who on the marble tomb Had his triumphal seat. 5. Silent the Man-Almighty sate; a smile Gleam'd on his dreadful lips, the while Dallying with power, he paused from following up His conquest, as a man in social hour Sips of the grateful cup, Again and yet again with curious taste Searching its subtle flavour ere he drink: Even so Kehama now forbore his haste, Having within his reach whate'er he sought, On his own haughty power he seem'd to muse, Pampering his arrogant heart with silent thought. Before him stood the Golden Throne in sight, Right opposite; he could not choose but see Nor seeing choose but wonder. Who are ye Who bear the Golden Throne tormented there? He cried; for whom doth Destiny prepare The Imperial Seat, and why are ye but Three? 6. FIRST STATUE. I of the Children of Mankind was first, Me miserable! who, adding store to store, Heapt up superfluous wealth; and now accurst, For ever I the frantic crime deplore. SECOND STATUE. I o'er my Brethren of Mankind the first Usurping power, set up a throne sublime, A King and Conqueror: therefore thus accurst, For ever I in vain repent the crime. THIRD STATUE. I on the Children of Mankind the first, In God's most holy name, imposed a tale Of impious falsehood; therefore thus accurst, For ever I in vain the crime bewail. 7. Even as thou here beholdest us, Here we have stood, tormented thus, Such countless ages, that they seem to be Long as eternity, And still we are but Three. A Fourth will come to share Our pain, at yonder vacant corner bear His portion of the burthen, and compleat The Golden Throne for Yamen's Judgement-seat. Thus hath it been appointed: he must be Equal in guilt to us, the guilty Three. Kehama, come! too long we wait for thee! 8. Thereat, with one accord, The Three took up the word, like choral song, Come Rajah! Man-God! Earth's Almighty Lord! Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long. 9. A short and sudden laugh of wondering pride Burst from him in his triumph: to reply Scornful he deign'd not; but with alter'd eye Wherein some doubtful meaning seem'd to lie, He turn'd to Kailyal. Maiden, thus he cried, I need not bid thee see How vain it is to strive with Fate's decree, When hither thou hast fled to fly from me, And lo! even here thou find'st me at thy side. Mine thou must be, being doom'd with me to share The Amreeta-cup of immortality; Yea, by Myself I swear, It hath been thus appointed. Joyfully Join then thy hand and heart and will with mine, Nor at such glorious destiny repine, Nor in thy folly more provoke my wrath divine. 10. She answer'd; I have said. It must not be! Almighty as thou art, Thou hast put all things underneath thy feet; But still the resolute heart And virtuous will are free. Never, oh! never, . . never.. can there be Communion, Rajah, between thee and me. 11. Once more, quoth he, I urge, and once alone. Thou seest yon Golden Throne, Where I anon shall set thee by my side; Take thou thy seat thereon, Kehama's willing bride, And I will place the Kingdoms of the World Beneath thy Father's feet, Appointing him the King of mortal men: Else underneath that Throne, The Fourth supporter he shall stand and groan; Prayers will be vain to move my mercy then. 12. Again the Virgin answer'd, I have said! Ladurlad caught her in his proud embrace, While on his neck she hid In agony her face. 13. Bring forth the Amreeta-cup! Kehama cried To Yamen, rising sternly in his pride. It is within the Marble Sepulchre, The vanquish'd Lord of Padalon replied, Bid it be open'd. Give thy treasure up! Exclaim'd the Man-Almighty to the Tomb. And at his voice and look The massy fabric shook, and open'd wide. A huge Anatomy was seen reclined Within its marble womb. Give me the Cup! Again Kehama cried; no other charm Was needed than that voice of stern command. From his repose the ghastly form arose, Put forth his boney and gigantic arm, And gave the Amreeta to the Rajah's hand. Take! drink! with accents dread the Spectre said, For thee and Kailyal hath it been assign'd, Ye only of the Children of Mankind. 14. Then was the Man-Almighty's heart elate; This is the consummation! he exclaim'd; Thus have I triumphed over Death and Fate. Now, Seeva! look to thine abode! Henceforth, on equal footing we engage, Alike immortal now, and we shall wage Our warfare, God to God! Joy fill'd his impious soul, And to his lips he raised the fatal bowl. 15. Thus long the Glendoveer had stood Watching the wonders of the eventful hour, Amazed but undismay'd; for in his heart Faith, overcoming fear, maintain'd its power. Nor had that faith abated, when the God Of Padalon was beaten down in fight; For then he look'd to see the heavenly might Of Seeva break upon them. But when now He saw the Amreeta in Kehama's hand, An impulse which defied all self-command In that extremity Stung him, and he resolved to seize the cup, And dare the Rajah's force in Seeva's sight. Forward he sprung to tempt the unequal fray, When lo! the Anatomy, With warning arm, withstood his desperate way, And from the Golden Throne the fiery Three Again, in one accord, renew'd their song, Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long. 16. O fool of drunken hope and frantic vice! Madman! to seek for power beyond thy scope Of knowledge, and to deem Less than Omniscience could suffice To wield Omnipotence! O fool, to dream That immortality could be The meed of evil! . . yea thou hast it now, Victim of thine own wicked heart's device, Thou hast thine object now, and now must pay the price. 17. He did not know the holy mystery Of that divinest cup, that as the lips Which touch it, even such its quality, Good or malignant: Madman! and he thinks The blessed prize is won, and joyfully he drinks. 18. Then Seeva open'd on the Accursed One His Eye of Anger: upon him alone The wrath-beam fell. He shudders.. but too late; The deed is done, The dreadful liquor works the will of Fate. Immortal he would be, Immortal he is made; but through his veins Torture at once and immortality, A stream of poison doth the Amreeta run, And while within the burning anguish flows, His outward body glows Like molten ore, beneath the avenging Eye, Doom'd thus to live and burn eternally. 19. The fiery Three, Beholding him, set up a fiendish cry, A song of jubilee; Come, Brother, come! they sung; too long Have we expected thee, Henceforth we bear no more The unequal weight; Come, Brother, we are Four! 20. Vain his almightiness, for mightier pain Subdued all power; pain ruled supreme alone; And yielding to the boney hand The unemptied cup, he moved toward the Throne, And at the vacant corner took his stand. Behold the Golden Throne at length complete, And Yamen silently ascends the Judgement-seat. 21. For two alone, of all mankind, to me The Amreeta Cup was given, Then said the Anatomy; The Man hath drank, the Woman's turn is next. Come, Kailyal, come, receive thy doom, And do the Will of Heaven! . . Wonder, and Fear, and Awe at once perplext The mortal Maiden's heart, but over all Hope rose triumphant. With a trembling hand, Obedient to his call, She took the fated Cup; and, lifting up Her eyes, where holy tears began to swell, Is it not your command, Ye heavenly Powers? as on her knees she fell, The pious Virgin cried; Ye know my innocent will, my heart sincere, Ye govern all things still, And wherefore should I fear! 22. She said, and drank. The Eye of Mercy beam'd Upon the Maid: a cloud of fragrance steam'd Like incense-smoke, as all her mortal frame Dissolved beneath the potent agency Of that mysterious draught; such quality, From her pure touch, the fated Cup partook. Like one entranced she knelt, Feeling her body melt Till all but what was heavenly pass'd away: Yet still she felt Her Spirit strong within her, the same heart, With the same loves, and all her heavenly part Unchang'd, and ripen'd to such perfect state In this miraculous birth, as here on Earth, Dimly our holiest hopes anticipate. 23. Mine! mine! with rapturous joy Ereenia cried, Immortal now, and yet not more divine; Mine, mine, . . . for ever mine! The immortal Maid replied, For ever, ever, thine! 24. Then Yamen said, O thou to whom by Fate, Alone of all mankind, this lot is given, Daughter of Earth, but now the Child of Heaven! Go with thy heavenly Mate, Partaker now of his immortal bliss; Go to the Swerga Bowers, And there recall the hours Of endless happiness. 25. But that sweet Angel, for she still retain'd Her human loves and human piety, As if reluctant at the God's commands, Linger'd, with anxious eye Upon her Father fix'd, and spread her hands Toward him wistfully. Go! Yamen said, nor cast that look behind Upon Ladurlad at this parting hour, For thou shalt find him in thy Mother's Bower. 26. The Car, for Carmala his word obey'd, Moved on, and bore away the Maid, While from the Golden Throne the Lord of Death With love benignant on Ladurlad smiled, And gently on his head his blessing laid. As sweetly as a Child, Whom neither thought disturbs nor care encumbers, Tired with long play, at close of summer day, Lies down and slumbers, Even thus as sweet a boon of sleep partaking, By Yamen blest, Ladurlad sunk to rest. Blessed that sleep! more blessed was the waking! For on that night a heavenly morning broke, The light of heaven was round him when he woke, And in the Swerga, in Yedillian's Bower, All whom he loved he met, to part no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IX. RODERICK, THE LAST OF THE GOTHS: A Tragic Poem. Tanto acrior apud majores, sicut virtutibus gloria, ita flagitiis pœnitentia, fuit. Sed hæc aliaque, ex veteri memoriâ petita, quotiens res locusque exempla recti, aut solatia mali, poscet, haud absurdè memorabimus. Taciti Hist. lib. 3. c. 51. TO GROSVENOR CHARLES BEDFORD, THIS POEM IS INSCRIBED, IN LASTING MEMORIAL OF A LONG AND UNINTERRUPTED FRIENDSHIP, BY HIS OLD SCHOOLFELLOW, ROBERT SOUTHEY. Orpas, ......... brother to Witiza, and formerly Archbishop of Seville, now a renegade. Sisibert, ....... son of Witiza and of Pelayo's mother. Ebba, ......... son of Witiza and of Pelayo's mother. Numacian, ..... a renegade, governor of Gegio. Count Julian, ... a powerful Lord among the Wisi-Goths, now a renegade. Florinda, ...... his daughter, violated by King Roderick. Adosinda, ...... daughter of the Governor of Auria. Odoar, ........ Abbot of St. Felix. Siverian, ...... Roderick's foster-father. Favinia, ....... Count Pedro's wife. The four latter persons are imaginary. All the others are mentioned in history. I ought, however, to observe, that Romano is a creature of monkish legends; that the name of Pelayo's sister has not been preserved; and that that of Roderick's mother, Ruscilo, has been altered to Rusilla, for the sake of euphony. I. RODERICK AND ROMANO. Long had the crimes of Spain cried out to Heaven; At length the measure of offence was full. Count Julian call'd the invaders; not because Inhuman priests with unoffending blood Had stain'd their country; not because a yoke Of iron servitude oppress'd and gall'd The children of the soil; a private wrong Roused the remorseless Baron. Mad to wreak His vengeance for his violated child On Roderick's head, in evil hour for Spain, For that unhappy daughter and himself, Desperate apostate.. on the Moors he call'd; And like a cloud of locusts, whom the South Wafts from the plains of wasted Africa, The Musselmen upon Iberia's shore Descend. A countless multitude they came; Syrian, Moor, Saracen, Greek renegade, Persian and Copt and Tatar, in one bond Of erring faith conjoin'd, . . strong in the youth And heat of zeal, . . a dreadful brotherhood, In whom all turbulent vices were let loose; While Conscience, with their impious creed accurst Drunk as with wine, had sanctified to them All bloody, all abominable things. Thou, Calpe, saw'st their coming; ancient Rock Renown'd, no longer now shalt thou be call'd From Gods and Heroes of the years of yore, Kronos, or hundred-handed Briareus, Bacchus or Hercules; but doom'd to bear The name of thy new conqueror, and thenceforth To stand his everlasting monument. Thou saw'st the dark-blue waters flash before Their ominous way, and whiten round their keels; Their swarthy myriads darkening o'er thy sands. There on the beach the Misbelievers spread Their banners, flaunting to the sun and breeze; Fair shone the sun upon their proud array, White turbans, glittering armour, shields engrail'd With gold, and scymitars of Syrian steel; And gently did the breezes, as in sport, Curl their long flags outrolling, and display The blazon'd scrolls of blasphemy. Too soon The gales of Spain from that unhappy land Wafted, as from an open charnel-house, The taint of death; and that bright sun, from fields Of slaughter, with the morning dew drew up Corruption through the infected atmosphere. Then fell the kingdom of the Goths; their hour Was come, and Vengeance, long withheld, went loose. Famine and Pestilence had wasted them, And Treason, like an old and eating sore, Consumed the bones and sinews of their strength; And worst of enemies, their Sins were arm'd Against them. Yet the sceptre from their hands Pass'd not away inglorious, nor was shame Left for their children's lasting heritage; Eight summer days, from morn till latest eve, The fatal fight endured, till perfidy Prevailing to their overthrow, they sunk Defeated, not dishonour'd. On the banks Of Chrysus, Roderick's royal car was found, His battle-horse Orelio, and that helm Whose horns, amid the thickest of the fray Eminent, had mark'd his presence. Did the stream Receive him with the undistinguish'd dead, Christian and Moor, who clogg'd its course that day? So thought the Conqueror, and from that day forth, Memorial of his perfect victory, He bade the river bear the name of Joy. So thought the Goths; they said no prayer for him, For him no service sung, nor mourning made, But charged their crimes upon his head, and curs'd His memory. Bravely in that eight-days fight The King had striven, . . for victory first, while hope Remain'd, then desperately in search of death. The arrows pass'd him by to right and left, The spear-point pierced him not, the scymitar Glanced from his helmet. Is the shield of Heaven, Wretch that I am, extended over me? Cried Roderick; and he dropt Orelio's reins, And threw his hands aloft in frantic prayer, .. Death is the only mercy that I crave, Death soon and short, death and forgetfulness! Aloud he cried; but in his inmost heart There answer'd him a secret voice, that spake Of righteousness and judgement after death, And God's redeeming love, which fain would save The guilty soul alive. 'Twas agony, And yet 'twas hope; . . a momentary light, That flash'd through utter darkness on the Cross To point salvation, then left all within Dark as before. Fear, never felt till then, Sudden and irresistible as stroke Of lightning, smote him. From his horse he dropt, Whether with human impulse, or by Heaven Struck down, he knew not; loosen'd from his wrist The sword-chain, and let fall the sword, whose hilt Clung to his palm a moment ere it fell, Glued there with Moorish gore. His royal robe, His horned helmet and enamell'd mail, He cast aside, and taking from the dead A peasant's garment, in those weeds involved Stole like a thief in darkness from the field. Evening closed round to favour him. All night He fled, the sound of battle in his ear Ringing, and sights of death before his eyes, With forms more horrible of eager fiends That seem'd to hover round, and gulphs of fire Opening beneath his feet. At times the groan Of some poor fugitive, who, bearing with him His mortal hurt, had fallen beside the way, Roused him from these dread visions, and he call'd In answering groans on his Redeemer's name, That word the only prayer that pass'd his lips Or rose within his heart. Then would he see The Cross whereon a bleeding Saviour hung, Who call'd on him to come and cleanse his soul In those all-healing streams, which from his wounds, As from perpetual springs, for ever flow'd. No hart e'er panted for the water-brooks As Roderick thirsted there to drink and live: But Hell was interposed; and worse than Hell.. Yea to his eyes more dreadful than the fiends Who flock'd like hungry ravens round his head, .. Florinda stood between, and warn'd him off With her abhorrent hands, . . that agony Still in her face, which, when the deed was done, Inflicted on her ravisher the curse That it invoked from Heaven.... Oh what a night Of waking horrors! Nor when morning came Did the realities of light and day Bring aught of comfort; wheresoe'er he went The tidings of defeat had gone before; And leaving their defenceless homes to seek What shelter walls and battlements might yield, Old men with feeble feet, and tottering babes, And widows with their infants in their arms, Hurried along. Nor royal festival, Nor sacred pageant, with like multitudes E'er fill'd the public way. All whom the sword Had spared were here; bed-rid infirmity Alone was left behind; the cripple plied His crutches, with her child of yesterday The mother fled, and she whose hour was come Fell by the road. Less dreadful than this view Of outward suffering which the day disclosed, Had night and darkness seem'd to Roderick's heart, With all their dread creations. From the throng He turn'd aside, unable to endure This burthen of the general woe; nor walls, Nor towers, nor mountain fastnesses he sought, A firmer hold his spirit yearn'd to find, A rock of surer strength. Unknowing where, Straight through the wild he hasten'd on all day, And with unslacken'd speed was travelling still When evening gather'd round. Seven days from morn Till night he travell'd thus; the forest oaks, The fig-grove by the fearful husbandman Forsaken to the spoiler, and the vines, Where fox and household dog together now Fed on the vintage, gave him food; the hand Of Heaven was on him, and the agony Which wrought within, supplied a strength beyond All natural force of man. When the eighth eve Was come, he found himself on Ana's banks, Fast by the Caulian Schools. It was the hour Of vespers, but no vesper bell was heard, Nor other sound, than of the passing stream, Or stork, who flapping with wide wing the air, Sought her broad nest upon the silent tower. Brethren and pupils thence alike had fled To save themselves within the embattled walls Of neighbouring Merida. One aged Monk Alone was left behind; he would not leave The sacred spot beloved, for having served There from his childhood up to ripe old age God's holy altar, it became him now, He thought, before that altar to await The merciless misbelievers, and lay down His life, a willing martyr. So he staid When all were gone, and duly fed the lamps, And kept devotedly the altar drest, And duly offer'd up the sacrifice. Four days and nights he thus had pass'd alone, In such high mood of saintly fortitude, That hope of Heaven became a heavenly joy; And now at evening to the gate he went If he might spy the Moors, . . for it seem'd long To tarry for his crown. Before the Cross Roderick had thrown himself; his body raised, Half kneeling, half at length he lay; his arms Embraced its foot, and from his lifted face Tears streaming down bedew'd the senseless stone. He had not wept till now, and at the gush Of these first tears, it seem'd as if his heart, From a long winter's icey thrall let loose, Had open'd to the genial influences Of Heaven. In attitude, but not in act Of prayer he lay; an agony of tears Was all his soul could offer. When the Monk Beheld him suffering thus, he raised him up, And took him by the arm, and led him in; And there before the altar, in the name Of Him whose bleeding image there was hung, Spake comfort, and adjured him in that name There to lay down the burthen of his sins. Lo! said Romano, I am waiting here The coming of the Moors, that from their hands My spirit may receive the purple robe Of martyrdom, and rise to claim its crown. That God who willeth not the sinner's death Hath led thee hither. Threescore years and five, Even from the hour when I, a five-years child, Enter'd the schools, have I continued here And served the altar: not in all those years Hath such a contrite and a broken heart Appear'd before me. O my brother, Heaven Hath sent thee for thy comfort, and for mine, That my last earthly act may reconcile A sinner to his God. Then Roderick knelt Before the holy man, and strove to speak. Thou seest, he cried, . . thou seest, . . but memory And suffocating thoughts repress'd the word, And shudderings like an ague fit, from head To foot convulsed him; till at length, subduing His nature to the effort, he exclaim'd, Spreading his hands and lifting up his face, As if resolved in penitence to bear A human eye upon his shame, . . Thou seest Roderick the Goth! That name would have sufficed To tell its whole abhorred history: He not the less pursued, . . the ravisher, The cause of all this ruin! Having said, In the same posture motionless he knelt, Arms straighten'd down, and hands outspread, and eyes Raised to the Monk, like one who from his voice Awaited life or death. All night the old man Pray'd with his penitent, and minister'd Unto the wounded soul, till he infused A healing hope of mercy that allay'd Its heat of anguish. But Romano saw What strong temptations of despair beset, And how he needed in this second birth, Even like a yearling child, a fosterer's care. Father in Heaven, he cried, thy will be done! Surely I hoped that I this day should sing Hosannahs at thy throne; but thou hast yet Work for thy servant here. He girt his loins, And from her altar took with reverent hands Our Lady's image down: In this, quoth he, We have our guide and guard and comforter, The best provision for our perilous way. Fear not but we shall find a resting place, The Almighty's hand is on us. They went forth, They cross'd the stream, and when Romano turn'd For his last look toward the Caulian towers, Far off the Moorish standards in the light Of morn were glittering, where the miscreant host Toward the Lusitanian capital To lay their siege advanced; the eastern breeze Bore to the fearful travellers far away The sound of horn and tambour o'er the plain. All day they hasten'd, and when evening fell Sped toward the setting sun, as if its line Of glory came from Heaven to point their course. But feeble were the feet of that old man For such a weary length of way; and now Being pass'd the danger (for in Merida Sacaru long in resolute defence Withstood the tide of war,) with easier pace The wanderers journey'd on; till having cross'd Rich Tagus, and the rapid Zezere, They from Albardos' hoary height beheld Pine-forest, fruitful vale, and that fair lake Where Alcoa, mingled there with Baza's stream, Rests on its passage to the western sea, That sea the aim and boundary of their toil. The fourth week of their painful pilgrimage Was full, when they arrived where from the land A rocky hill, rising with steep ascent, O'erhung the glittering beach; there on the top A little lowly hermitage they found, And a rude Cross, and at its foot a grave, Bearing no name, nor other monument. Where better could they rest than here, where faith And secret penitence and happiest death Had bless'd the spot, and brought good Angels down, And open'd as it were a way to Heaven? Behind them was the desert, offering fruit And water for their need: on either side The white sand sparkling to the sun; in front, Great Ocean with its everlasting voice, As in perpetual jubilee, proclaim'd The wonders of the Almighty, filling thus The pauses of their fervent orisons. Where better could the wanderers rest than here? II. RODERICK IN SOLITUDE. Twelve months they sojourn'd in their solitude, And then beneath the burthen of old age Romano sunk. No brethren were there here To spread the sackcloth, and with ashes strew That penitential bed, and gather round To sing his requiem, and with prayer and psalm Assist him in his hour of agony. He lay on the bare earth, which long had been His only couch; beside him Roderick knelt, Moisten'd from time to time his blacken'd lips, Received a blessing with his latest breath, Then closed his eyes, and by the nameless grave Of the fore-tenant of that holy place Consign'd him earth to earth. Two graves are here, And Roderick transverse at their feet began To break the third. In all his intervals Of prayer, save only when he search'd the woods And fill'd the water-cruise, he labour'd there; And when the work was done, and he had laid Himself at length within its narrow sides And measured it, he shook his head to think There was no other business now for him. Poor wretch, thy bed is ready, he exclaim'd, And would that night were come! . . It was a task, All gloomy as it was, which had beguiled The sense of solitude; but now he felt The burthen of the solitary hours: The silence of that lonely hermitage Lay on him like a spell; and at the voice Of his own prayers, he started half aghast. Then too as on Romano's grave he sate And pored upon his own, a natural thought Arose within him, . . well might he have spared That useless toil; the sepulchre would be No hiding place for him; no Christian hands Were here who should compose his decent corpse And cover it with earth. There he might drag His wretched body at its passing hour, But there the Sea-Birds of her heritage Would rob the worm, or peradventure seize, Ere death had done its work, their helpless prey. Even now they did not fear him: when he walk'd Beside them on the beach, regardlessly They saw his coming; and their whirring wings Upon the height had sometimes fann'd his cheek, As if, being thus alone, humanity Had lost its rank, and the prerogative Of man were done away. For his lost crown And sceptre never had he felt a thought Of pain; repentance had no pangs to spare For trifles such as these, . . the loss of these Was a cheap penalty; . . that he had fallen Down to the lowest depth of wretchedness, His hope and consolation. But to lose His human station in the scale of things, .. To see brute nature scorn him, and renounce Its homage to the human form divine; .. Had then Almighty vengeance thus reveal'd His punishment, and was he fallen indeed Below fallen man, below redemption's reach, .. Made lower than the beasts, and like the beasts To perish! . . Such temptations troubled him By day, and in the visions of the night; And even in sleep he struggled with the thought, And waking with the effort of his prayers The dream assail'd him still. A wilder form Sometimes his poignant penitence assumed, Starting with force revived from intervals Of calmer passion, or exhausted rest; When floating back upon the tide of thought Remembrance to a self-excusing strain Beguiled him, and recall'd in long array The sorrows and the secret impulses Which to the abyss of wretchedness and guilt Led their unwary victim. The evil hour Return'd upon him, when reluctantly Yielding to worldly counsel his assent, In wedlock to an ill-assorted mate He gave his cold unwilling hand: then came The disappointment of the barren bed, The hope deceived, the soul dissatisfied, Home without love, and privacy from which Delight was banish'd first, and peace too soon Departed. Was it strange that when he met A heart attuned, . . a spirit like his own, Of lofty pitch, yet in affection mild, And tender as a youthful mother's joy, .. Oh was it strange if at such sympathy The feelings which within his breast repell'd And chill'd had shrunk, should open forth like flowers After cold winds of night, when gentle gales Restore the genial sun? If all were known, Would it indeed be not to be forgiven? .. (Thus would he lay the unction to his soul,) If all were truly known, as Heaven knows all, Heaven that is merciful as well as just, .. A passion slow and mutual in its growth, Pure as fraternal love, long self-conceal'd, And when confess'd in silence, long controll'd; Treacherous occasion, human frailty, fear Of endless separation, worse than death, .. The purpose and the hope with which the Fiend Tempted, deceived, and madden'd him; ... but then As at a new temptation would he start, Shuddering beneath the intolerable shame, And clench in agony his matted hair; While in his soul the perilous thought arose, How easy 'twere to plunge where yonder waves Invited him to rest. Oh for a voice Of comfort, . . for a ray of hope from Heaven! A hand that from these billows of despair May reach and snatch him ere he sink engulph'd! At length, as life when it hath lain long time Opprest beneath some grievous malady, Seems to rouse up with re-collected strength, And the sick man doth feel within himself A second spring; so Roderick's better mind Arose to save him. Lo! the western sun Flames o'er the broad Atlantic; on the verge Of glowing ocean rests; retiring then Draws with it all its rays, and sudden night Fills the whole cope of heaven. The penitent Knelt by Romano's grave, and falling prone, Claspt with extended arms the funeral mould. Father! he cried; Companion! only friend, When all beside was lost! thou too art gone, And the poor sinner whom from utter death Thy providential hand preserved, once more Totters upon the gulph. I am too weak For solitude, . . too vile a wretch to bear This everlasting commune with myself. The Tempter hath assail'd me; my own heart Is leagued with him; Despair hath laid the nets To take my soul, and Memory, like a ghost, Haunts me, and drives me to the toils. O Saint, While I was blest with thee, the hermitage Was my sure haven! Look upon me still, For from thy heavenly mansion thou canst see The suppliant; look upon thy child in Christ. Is there no other way for penitence? I ask not martyrdom; for what am I That I should pray for triumphs, the fit meed Of a long life of holy works like thine; Or how should I presumptuously aspire To wear the heavenly crown resign'd by thee, For my poor sinful sake? Oh point me thou Some humblest, painfulest, severest path, .. Some new austerity, unheard of yet In Syrian fields of glory, or the sands Of holiest Egypt. Let me bind my brow With thorns, and barefoot seek Jerusalem, Tracking the way with blood; there day by day Inflict upon this guilty flesh the scourge, Drink vinegar and gall, and for my bed Hang with extended limbs upon the Cross, A nightly crucifixion! . . any thing Of action, difficulty, bodily pain, Labour, and outward suffering, . . any thing But stillness and this dreadful solitude! Romano! Father! let me hear thy voice In dreams, O sainted Soul! or from the grave Speak to thy penitent; even from the grave Thine were a voice of comfort. Thus he cried, Easing the pressure of his burthen'd heart With passionate prayer; thus pour'd his spirit forth, Till with the long impetuous effort spent, His spirit fail'd, and laying on the grave His weary head as on a pillow, sleep Fell on him. He had pray'd to hear a voice Of consolation, and in dreams a voice Of consolation came. Roderick, it said, .. Roderick, my poor, unhappy, sinful child, Jesus have mercy on thee! ... Not if Heaven Had opened, and Romano, visible In his beatitude, had breathed that prayer; .. Not if the grave had spoken, had it pierced So deeply in his soul, nor wrung his heart With such compunctious visitings, nor given So quick, so keen a pang. It was that voice Which sung his fretful infancy to sleep So patiently; which soothed his childish griefs, Counsell'd, with anguish and prophetic tears, His headstrong youth. And lo! his Mother stood Before him in the vision; in those weeds Which never from the hour when to the grave She follow'd her dear lord Theodofred Rusilla laid aside; but in her face A sorrow that bespake a heavier load At heart, and more unmitigated woe, .. Yea a more mortal wretchedness than when Witiza's ruffians and the red-hot brass Had done their work, and in her arms she held Her eyeless husband; wiped away the sweat Which still his tortures forced from every pore; Cool'd his scorch'd lids with medicinal herbs, And pray'd the while for patience for herself And him, and pray'd for vengeance too, and found Best comfort in her curses. In his dream, Groaning he knelt before her to beseech Her blessing, and she raised her hands to lay A benediction on him. But those hands Were chain'd, and casting a wild look around, With thrilling voice she cried, Will no one break These shameful fetters? Pedro, Theudemir, Athanagild, where are ye? Roderick's arm Is wither'd; . . Chiefs of Spain, but where are ye? And thou, Pelayo, thou our surest hope, Dost thou too sleep? . . Awake, Pelayo! . . up! .. Why tarriest thou, Deliverer? . . But with that She broke her bonds, and lo! her form was changed! Radiant in arms she stood! a bloody Cross Gleam'd on her breast-plate, in her shield display'd Erect a lion ramp'd; her helmed head Rose like the Berecynthian Goddess crown'd With towers, and in her dreadful hand the sword Red as a fire-brand blazed. Anon the tramp Of horsemen, and the din of multitudes Moving to mortal conflict, rang around; The battle-song, the clang of sword and shield, War-cries and tumult, strife and hate and rage, Blasphemous prayers, confusion, agony, Rout and pursuit and death; and over all The shout of victory... Spain and Victory! Roderick, as the strong vision master'd him, Rush'd to the fight rejoicing: starting then, As his own effort burst the charm of sleep, He found himself upon that lonely grave In moonlight and in silence. But the dream Wrought in him still; for still he felt his heart Pant, and his wither'd arm was trembling still; And still that voice was in his ear which call'd On Jesus for his sake. Oh, might he hear That actual voice! and if Rusilla lived, .. If shame and anguish for his crimes not yet Had brought her to the grave, . . sure she would bless Her penitent child, and pour into his heart Prayers and forgiveness, which like precious balm, Would heal the wounded soul. Nor to herself Less precious, or less healing, would the voice That spake forgiveness flow. She wept her son For ever lost, cut off with all the weight Of unrepented sin upon his head, Sin which had weigh'd a nation down... what joy To know that righteous Heaven had in its wrath Remember'd mercy, and she yet might meet The child whom she had borne, redeem'd, in bliss. The sudden impulse of such thoughts confirm'd That unacknowledged purpose, which till now Vainly had sought its end. He girt his loins, Laid holiest Mary's image in a cleft Of the rock, where, shelter'd from the elements, It might abide till happier days came on, From all defilement safe; pour'd his last prayer Upon Romano's grave, and kiss'd the earth Which cover'd his remains, and wept as if At long leave-taking, then began his way. III. ADOSINDA. 'Twas now the earliest morning; soon the Sun, Rising above Albardos, pour'd his light Amid the forest, and with ray aslant Entering its depth, illumed the branchless pines, Brighten'd their bark, tinged with a redder hue Its rusty stains, and cast along the floor Long lines of shadow, where they rose erect Like pillars of the temple. With slow foot Roderick pursued his way; for penitence, Remorse which gave no respite, and the long And painful conflict of his troubled soul, Had worn him down. Now brighter thoughts arose, And that triumphant vision floated still Before his sight with all her blazonry, Her castled helm, and the victorious sword That flash'd like lightning o'er the field of blood. Sustain'd by thoughts like these, from morn till eve He journey'd, and drew near Leyria's walls. 'Twas even-song time, but not a bell was heard; Instead thereof, on her polluted towers, Bidding the Moors to their unhallow'd prayer, The cryer stood, and with his sonorous voice Fill'd the delicious vale where Lena winds Thro' groves and pastoral meads. The sound, the sight Of turban, girdle, robe, and scymitar, And tawny skins, awoke contending thoughts Of anger, shame, and anguish in the Goth; The face of human-kind so long unseen Confused him now, and through the streets he went With haggëd mien, and countenance like one Crazed or bewilder'd. All who met him turn'd, And wonder'd as he pass'd. One stopt him short, Put alms into his hand, and then desired In broken Gothic speech, the moon-struck man To bless him. With a look of vacancy Roderick received the alms; his wandering eye Fell on the money, and the fallen King, Seeing his own royal impress on the piece, Broke out into a quick convulsive voice, That seem'd like laughter first, but ended soon In hollow groans supprest; the Musselman Shrunk at the ghastly sound, and magnified The name of Allah as he hasten'd on. A Christian woman spinning at her door Beheld him, and, with sudden pity touch'd, She laid her spindle by, and running in Took bread, and following after call'd him back, And placing in his passive hands the loaf, She said, Christ Jesus for his mother's sake Have mercy on thee! With a look that seem'd Like idiotcy he heard her, and stood still, Staring awhile; then bursting into tears Wept like a child, and thus relieved his heart, Full even to bursting else with swelling thoughts. So through the streets, and through the northern gate Did Roderick, reckless of a resting-place, With feeble yet with hurried step pursue His agitated way; and when he reach'd The open fields, and found himself alone Beneath the starry canopy of Heaven, The sense of solitude, so dreadful late, Was then repose and comfort. There he stopt Beside a little rill, and brake the loaf; And shedding o'er that long untasted food Painful but quiet tears, with grateful soul He breathed thanksgiving forth, then made his bed On heath and myrtle. But when he arose At day-break and pursued his way, his heart Felt lighten'd that the shock of mingling first Among his fellow-kind was overpast; And journeying on, he greeted whom he met With such short interchange of benison As each to other gentle travellers give, Recovering thus the power of social speech Which he had long disused. When hunger prest He ask'd for alms: slight supplication served; A countenance so pale and woe-begone Moved all to pity; and the marks it bore Of rigorous penance and austerest life, With something too of majesty that still Appear'd amid the wreck, inspired a sense Of reverence too. The goat-herd on the hills Open'd his scrip for him; the babe in arms, Affrighted at his visage, turn'd away, And clinging to the mother's neck in tears Would yet again look up, and then again, Shrink back, with cry renew'd. The bolder imps Sporting beside the way, at his approach Brake off their games for wonder, and stood still In silence; some among them cried, A Saint! The village matron when she gave him food Besought his prayers; and one entreated him To lay his healing hands upon her child, For with a sore and hopeless malady Wasting, it long had lain, . . and sure, she said, He was a man of God. Thus travelling on He past the vale where wild Arunca pours Its wintry torrents; and the happier site Of old Conimbrica, whose ruin'd towers Bore record of the fierce Alani's wrath. Mondego too he cross'd, not yet renown'd In poets' amorous lay; and left behind The walls at whose foundation pious hands Of Priest and Monk and Bishop meekly toil'd, .. So had the insulting Arian given command. Those stately palaces and rich domains Were now the Moor's, and many a weary age Must Coimbra wear the misbeliever's yoke, Before Fernando's banner through her gate Shall pass triumphant, and her hallow'd Mosque Behold the hero of Bivar receive The knighthood which he glorified so oft In his victorious fields. Oh if the years To come might then have risen on Roderick's soul, How had they kindled and consoled his heart! ... What joy might Douro's haven then have given, Whence Portugal, the faithful and the brave, Shall take her name illustrious! . . what, those walls Where Mumadona one day will erect Convent and town and towers, which shall become The cradle of that famous monarchy! What joy might these prophetic scenes have given, .. What ample vengeance on the Musselman, Driven out with foul defeat, and made to feel In Africa the wrongs he wrought to Spain; And still pursued by that relentless sword, Even to the farthest Orient, where his power Received its mortal wound. O years of pride! In undiscoverable futurity, Yet unevolved, your destined glories lay; And all that Roderick in these fated scenes Beheld, was grief and wretchedness, . . the waste Of recent war, and that more mournful calm Of joyless, helpless, hopeless servitude. 'Twas not the ruin'd walls of church or tower, Cottage or hall or convent, black with smoke; 'Twas not the unburied bones, which where the dogs And crows had strewn them, lay amid the field Bleaching in sun or shower, that wrung his heart With keenest anguish: 'twas when he beheld The turban'd traitor shew his shameless front In the open eye of Heaven, . . the renegade, On whose base brutal nature unredeem'd Even black apostacy itself could stamp No deeper reprobation, at the hour Assign'd fall prostrate; and unite the names Of God and the Blasphemer, . . impious prayer, .. Most impious, when from unbelieving lips The accursëd utterance came. Then Roderick's heart With indignation burnt, and then he long'd To be a King again, that so, for Spain Betray'd and his Redeemer thus renounced, He might inflict due punishment, and make These wretches feel his wrath. But when he saw The daughters of the land, . . who, as they went With cheerful step to church, were wont to shew Their innocent faces to all passers eyes, Freely, and free from sin as when they look'd In adoration and in praise to Heaven, .. Now mask'd in Moorish mufflers, to the Mosque Holding uncompanied their jealous way, His spirit seem'd at that unhappy sight To die away within him, and he too Would fain have died, so death could bring with it Entire oblivion. Rent with thoughts like these, He reach'd that city, once the seat renown'd Of Suevi kings, where, in contempt of Rome Degenerate long, the North's heroic race Raised first a rival throne; now from its state Of proud regality debased and fallen. Still bounteous nature o'er the lovely vale, Where like a Queen rose Bracara august, Pour'd forth her gifts profuse; perennial springs Flow'd for her habitants, and genial suns, With kindly showers to bless the happy clime, Combined in vain their gentle influences: For patient servitude was there, who bow'd His neck beneath the Moor, and silent grief That eats into the soul. The walls and stones Seem'd to reproach their dwellers; stately piles Yet undecay'd, the mighty monuments Of Roman pomp, Barbaric palaces, And Gothic halls, where haughty Barous late Gladden'd their faithful vassals with the feast And flowing bowl, alike the spoiler's now. Leaving these captive scenes behind, he crost Cavado's silver current, and the banks Of Lima, through whose groves in after years, Mournful yet sweet, Diogo's amorous lute Prolong'd its tuneful echoes. But when now Beyond Arnoya's tributary tide, He came where Minho roll'd its ampler stream By Auria's ancient walls, fresh horrors met His startled view; for prostrate in the dust Those walls were laid, and towers and temples stood Tottering in frightful ruins, as the flame Had left them black and bare; and through the streets, All with the recent wreck of war bestrewn, Helmet and turban, scymitar and sword, Christian and Moor in death promiscuous lay Each where they fell; and blood-flakes, parch'd and crack'd Like the dry slime of some receding flood; And half-burnt bodies, which allured from far The wolf and raven, and to impious food Tempted the houseless dog. A thrilling pang, A sweat like death, a sickness of the soul, Came over Roderick. Soon they pass'd away, And admiration in their stead arose, Stern joy, and inextinguishable hope, With wrath, and hate, and sacred vengeance now Indissolubly link'd. O valiant race, O people excellently brave, he cried, True Goths ye fell, and faithful to the last; Though overpower'd, triumphant, and in death Unconquer'd! Holy be your memory! Bless'd and glorious now and evermore Be your heroic names! . . Led by the sound, As thus he cried aloud, a woman came Toward him from the ruins. For the love Of Christ, she said, lend me a little while Thy charitable help! ... Her words, her voice, Her look, more horror to his heart convey'd Than all the havoc round: for though she spake With the calm utterance of despair, in tones Deep-breathed and low, yet never sweeter voice Pour'd forth its hymns in ecstasy to Heaven. Her hands were bloody, and her garments stain'd With blood, her face with blood and dust defiled. Beauty and youth, and grace and majesty, Had every charm of form and feature given; But now upon her rigid countenance Severest anguish set a fixedness Ghastlier than death. She led him through the streets A little way along, where four low walls, Heapt rudely from the ruins round, enclosed A narrow space: and there upon the ground Four bodies, decently composed, were laid, Though horrid all with wounds and clotted gore: A venerable ancient, by his side A comely matron, for whose middle age, (If ruthless slaughter had not intervened,) Nature it seem'd, and gentle Time, might well Have many a calm declining year in store; The third an armëd warrior, on his breast An infant, over whom his arms were cross'd. There, . . with firm eye and steady countenance, Unfaltering, she addrest him, . . there they lie, Child, Husband, Parents, . . Adosinda's all! I could not break the earth with these poor hands, Nor other tomb provide, . . but let that pass! Auria itself is now but one wide tomb For all its habitants:— What better grave? What worthier monument? . . Oh cover not Their blood, thou Earth! and ye, ye blessëd Souls Of Heroes and of murder'd Innocents, Oh never let your everlasting cries Cease round the Eternal Throne, till the Most High For all these unexampled wrongs hath given Full, . . overflowing vengeance! While she spake She raised her lofty hands to Heaven, as if Calling for justice on the Judgement-seat; Then laid them on her eyes, and leaning on Bent o'er the open sepulchre. But soon With quiet mien collectedly, like one Who from intense devotion, and the act Of ardent prayer, arising, girds himself For this world's daily business, . . she arose, And said to Roderick, Help me now to raise The covering of the tomb. With half-burnt planks, Which she had gather'd for this funeral use They roof'd the vault, then laying stones above They closed it down; last, rendering all secure, Stones upon stones they piled, till all appear'd A huge and shapeless heap. Enough, she cried; And taking Roderick's hands in both her own, And wringing them with fervent thank fulness, May God shew mercy to thee, she exclaim'd, When most thou needest mercy! Who thou art I know not; not of Auria, . . for of all Her sons and daughters, save the one who stands Before thee, not a soul is left alive. But thou hast render'd to me, in my hour Of need, the only help which man could give. What else of consolation may be found For one so utterly bereft, from Heaven And from myself must come. For deem not thou That I shall sink beneath calamity: This visitation, like a lightning-stroke, Hath scathed the fruit and blossom of my youth; One hour hath orphan'd me, and widow'd me, And made me childless. In this sepulchre Lie buried all my earthward hopes and fears, All human loves and natural charities; .. All womanly tenderness, all gentle thoughts, All female weakness too, I bury here, Yea, all my former nature. There remain Revenge and death: . . the bitterness of death Is past, and Heaven already hath vouchsafed A foretaste of revenge. Look here! she cried, And drawing back, held forth her bloody hands, . 'Tis Moorish! ... In the day of massacre, A captain of Alcahman's murderous host Reserved me from the slaughter. Not because My rank and station tempted him with thoughts Of ransom, for amid the general waste Of ruin all was lost; ... Nor yet, be sure, That pity moved him, . . they who from this race Accurst for pity look, such pity find As ravenous wolves shew the defenceless flock. My husband at my feet had fallen; my babe, .. Spare me that thought, O God! . . and then.. even then Amid the maddening throes of agony Which rent my soul, . . when if this solid Earth Had open'd and let out the central fire Before whose all-involving flames wide Heaven Shall shrivel like a scroll and be consumed, The universal wreck had been to me Relief and comfort; ... even then this Moor Turn'd on me his libidinous eyes, and bade His men reserve me safely for an hour Of dalliance, . . me! . . me in my agonies! But when I found for what this miscreant child Of Hell had snatch'd me from the butchery, The very horror of that monstrous thought Saved me from madness; I was calm at once, .. Yet comforted and reconciled to life: Hatred became to me the life of life, Its purpose and its power. The glutted Moors At length broke up. This hell-dog turn'd aside Toward his home; we travell'd fast and far, Till by a forest edge at eve he pitched His tents. I wash'd and ate at his command, Forcing revolted nature; I composed My garments and bound up my scatter'd hair; And when he took my hand, and to his couch Would fain have drawn me, gently I retired From that abominable touch, and said, Forbear to-night I pray thee, for this day A widow, as thou seest me, am I made; Therefore, according to our law, must watch And pray to-night. The loathsome villain paused Ere he assented, then laid down to rest; While at the door of the pavilion, I Knelt on the ground, and bowed my face to earth; But when the neigh bouring tents had ceased theirstir, The fires were out, and all were fast asleep, Then I arose. The blessed Moon from Heaven Lent me her holy light. I did not pray For strength, for strength was given me as I drew The scymitar, and, standing o'er his couch, Raised it in both my hands with steady aim And smote his neck. Upward, as from a spring When newly open'd by the husbandman, The villain's life-blood spouted. Twice I struck, So making vengeance sure; then, praising God, Retired amid the wood, and measured back My patient way to Auria, to perform This duty which thou seest. As thus she spake, Roderick intently listening had forgot His crown, his kingdom, his calamities, His crimes, . . so like a spell upon the Goth Her powerful words prevail'd. With open lips, And eager ear, and eyes which, while they watch'd Her features, caught the spirit that she breathed, Mute and enrapt he stood, and motionless; The vision rose before him; and that shout, Which, like a thunder-peal, victorious Spain Sent through the welkin, rung within his soul Its deep prophetic echoes. On his brow The pride and power of former majesty Dawn'd once again, but changed and purified: Duty and high heroic purposes Now hallow'd it, and as with inward light Illumed his meagre countenance austere. A while in silence Adosinda stood, Reading his alter'd visage and the thoughts Which thus transfigured him. Aye, she exclaim'd, My tale hath moved thee! it might move the dead, Quicken captivity's dead soul, and rouse This prostrate country from her mortal trance: Therefore I live to tell it; and for this Hath the Lord God Almighty given to me A spirit not mine own and strength from Heaven; Dealing with me as in the days of old With that Bethulian Matron when she saved His people from the spoiler. What remains But that the life which he hath thus preserved I consecrate to him? Not veil'd and vow'd To pass my days in holiness and peace; Nor yet between sepulchral walls immured, Alive to penitence alone; my rule He hath himself prescribed, and hath infused A passion in this woman's breast, wherein All passions and all virtues are combined; Love, hatred, joy, and anguish, and despair, And hope, and natural piety, and faith, Make up the mighty feeling. Call it not Revenge! thus sanctified and thus sublimed, 'Tis duty, 'tis devotion. Like the grace Of God, it came and saved me; and in it Spain must have her salvation. In thy hands Here, on the grave of all my family, I make my vow. She said, and kneeling down, Placed within Roderick's palms her folded hands. This life, she cried, I dedicate to God, Therewith to do him service in the way Which he hath shown. To rouse the land against This impious, this intolerable yoke, .. To offer up the invader's hateful blood, .. This shall be my employ, my rule and rite, Observances and sacrifice of faith; For this I hold the life which he hath given, A sacred trust; for this, when it shall suit His service, joyfully will lay it down. So deal with me as I fulfil the pledge, O Lord my God, my Saviour and my Judge. Then rising from the earth, she spread her arms, And looking round with sweeping eyes exclaim'd, Auria, and Spain, and Heaven receive the vow! IV. THE MONASTERY OF ST. FELIX. Thus long had Roderick heard her powerful words In silence, awed before her; but his heart Was fill'd the while with swelling sympathy, And now with impulse not to be restrain'd The feeling overpower'd him. Hear me too, Auria, and Spain, and Heaven! he cried; and thou Who risest thus above mortality, Sufferer and patriot, saint and heroine, The servant and the chosen of the Lord, For surely such thou art, . . receive in me The first-fruits of thy calling. Kneeling then, And placing as he spake his hand in her's, As thou hast sworn, the royal Goth pursued, Even so I swear; my soul hath found at length Her rest and refuge; in the invader's blood She must efface her stains of mortal sin, And in redeeming this lost land, work out Redemption for herself. Herein I place My penance for the past, my hope to come, My faith and my good works; here offer up All thoughts and passions of mine inmost heart, My days and night, . . this flesh, this blood, this life, Yea this whole being, do I here devote For Spain. Receive the vow, all Saints in Heaven, And prosper its good end! ... Clap now your wings, The Goth with louder utterance as he rose Exclaim'd, ... clap now your wings exultingly, Ye ravenous fowl of Heaven; and in your dens Set up, ye wolves of Spain, a yell of joy; For, lo! a nation hath this day been sworn To furnish forth your banquet; for a strife Hath been commenced, the which from this day forth Permits no breathing-time, and knows no end Till in this land the last invader bow His neck beneath the exterminating sword. Said I not rightly? Adosinda cried; The will which goads me on is not mine own, 'Tis from on high, . . yea, verily of Heaven! But who art thou who hast profess'd with me, My first sworn brother in the appointed rule? Tell me thy name. Ask any thing but that! The fallen King replied. My name was lost When from the Goths the sceptre pass'd away. The nation will arise regenerate; Strong in her second youth and beautiful, And like a spirit which hath shaken off The clog of dull mortality, shall Spain Arise in glory. But for my good name No resurrection is appointed here. Let it be blotted out on earth: in Heaven There shall be written with it penitence And grace and saving faith and such good deeds Wrought in atonement as my soul this day Hath sworn to offer up. Then be thy name, She answer'd, Maccabee, from this day forth: For this day art thou born again; and like Those brethren of old times, whose holy names Live in the memory of all noble hearts For love and admiration, ever young, .. So for our native country, for her hearths And altars, for her cradles and her graves, Hast thou thyself devoted. Let us now Each to our work. Among the neigh bouring hills, I to the vassals of my father's house; Thou to Visonia. Tell the Abbot there What thou hast seen at Auria; and with him Take counsel who of all our Baronage Is worthiest to lead on the sons of Spain, And wear upon his brow the Spanish crown. Now, brother, fare thee well! we part in hope, And we shall meet again, be sure, in joy. So saying, Adosinda left the King Alone amid the ruins. There he stood, As when Elisha, on the farther bank Of Jordan, saw that elder prophet mount The fiery chariot, and the steeds of fire, Trampling the whirlwind, bear him up the sky: Thus gazing after her did Roderick stand; And as the immortal Tishbite left behind His mantle and prophetic power, even so Had her inspiring presence left infused The spirit which she breathed. Gazing he stood, As at a heavenly visitation there Vouchsafed in mercy to himself and Spain; And when the heroic mourner from his sight Had pass'd away, still reverential awe Held him suspended there and motionless. Then turning from the ghastly scene of death Up murmuring Lona, he began toward The holy Bierzo his obedient way. Sil's ample stream he crost, where through the vale Of Orras, from that sacred land it bears The whole collected waters; northward then, Skirting the heights of Aguiar, he reach'd That consecrated pile amid the wild, Which sainted Fructuoso in his zeal Rear'd to St. Felix, on Visonia's banks. In commune with a priest of age mature, Whose thoughtful visage and majestic mien Bespake authority and weight of care, Odoar, the venerable Abbot, sate, When ushering Roderick in, the Porter said, A stranger came from Auria, and required His private ear. From Auria? said the old man, Comest thou from Auria, brother? I can spare Thy painful errand then, . . we know the worst. Nay, answer'd Roderick, but thou hast not heard My tale. Where that devoted city lies In ashes, mid the ruins and the dead I found a woman, whom the Moors had borne Captive away; but she, by Heaven inspired And her good heart, with her own arm had wrought Her own deliverance, smiting in his tent A lustful Moorish miscreant, as of yore By Judith's holy deed the Assyrian fell. And that same spirit which had strengthen'd her Work'd in her still. Four walls with patient toil She rear'd, wherein, as in a sepulchre, With her own hands she laid her murder'd babe, Her husband and her parents, side by side; And when we cover'd in this shapeless tomb, There on the grave of all her family, Did this courageous mourner dedicate All thoughts and actions of her future life To her poor country. For she said, that Heaven Supporting her, in mercy had vouchsafed A foretaste of revenge; that, like the grace Of God, revenge had saved her; that in it Spain must have her salvation; and henceforth That passion, thus sublimed and sanctified, Must be to all the loyal sons of Spain The pole-star of their faith, their rule and rite, Observances and worthiest sacrifice. I took the vow, unworthy as I am, Her first sworn follower in the appointed rule; And then we parted; she among the hills To rouse the vassals of her father's house: I at her bidding hitherward, to ask Thy counsel, who of our old Baronage Shall place upon his brow the Spanish crown. The Lady Adosinda? Odoar cried. Roderick made answer, So she call'd herself. Oh none but she! exclaim'd the good old man, Clasping his hands, which trembled as he spake In act of pious passion raised to Heaven, .. Oh none but Adosinda! . . none but she, .. None but that noble heart, which was the heart Of Auria while it stood, its life and strength, More than her father's presence, or the arm Of her brave husband, valiant as he was. Hers was the spirit which inspired old age, Ambitious boyhood, girls in timid youth, And virgins in the beauty of their spring, And youthful mothers, doting like herself With ever-anxious love: She breathed through all That zeal and that devoted faithfulness, Which to the invader's threats and promises Turn'd a deaf ear alike; which in the head And flood of prosperous fortune check'd his course, Repell'd him from the walls, and when at length His overpowering numbers forced their way, Even in that uttermost extremity Unyielding, still from street to street, from house To house, from floor to floor, maintain'd the fight: Till by their altars falling, in their doors, And on their household hearths, and by their beds And cradles, and their fathers' sepulchres, This noble army, gloriously revenged, Embraced their martyrdom. Heroic souls! Well have ye done, and righteously discharged Your arduous part! Your service is perform'd, Your earthly warfare done! Ye have put on The purple robe of everlasting peace! Ye have received your crown! Ye bear the palm Before the throne of Grace! With that he paused, Checking the strong emotions of his soul. Then with a solemn tone addressing him Who shared his secret thoughts, thou knowest, he said, O Urban, that they have not fallen in vain; For by this virtuous sacrifice they thinn'd Alcahman's thousands; and his broken force, Exhausted by their dear-bought victory, Turn'd back from Auria, leaving us to breathe Among our mountains yet. We lack not here Good hearts, nor valiant hands. What walls or towers Or battlements are like these fastnesses, These rocks and glens and everlasting hills? Give but that Aurian spirit, and the Moors Will spend their force as idly on these holds, As round the rocky girdle of the land The wild Cantabrian billows waste their rage. Give but that spirit! . . Heaven hath given it us, If Adosinda thus, as from the dead, Be granted to our prayers! And who art thou, Said Urban, who hast taken on thyself This rule of warlike faith? Thy countenance And those poor weeds bespeak a life ere this Devoted to austere observances. Roderick replied, I am a sinful man, One who in solitude hath long deplored A life mis-spent; but never bound by vows, Till Adosinda taught me where to find Comfort, and how to work forgiveness out. When that exalted woman took my vow, She call'd me Maccabee; from this day forth Be that my earthly name. But tell me now, Whom shall we rouse to take upon his head The crown of Spain? Where are the Gothic Chiefs? Sacaru, Theudemir, Athanagild, All who survived that eight days' obstinate fight, When clogg'd with bodies Chrysus scarce could force Its bloody stream along? Witiza's sons, Bad offspring of a stock accurst, I know, Have put the turban on their recreant heads. Where are your own Cantabrian Lords? I ween, Eudon, and Pedro, and Pelayo now Have ceased their rivalry. If Pelayo live, His were the worthy heart and rightful hand To wield the sceptre and the sword of Spain. Odoar and Urban eyed him while he spake, As if they wonder'd whose the tongue might be Familiar thus with Chiefs and thoughts of state. They scann'd his countenance, but not a trace Betray'd the Royal Goth: sunk was that eye Of sovereignty, and on the emaciate cheek Had penitence and anguish deeply drawn Their furrows premature, . . forestalling time, And shedding upon thirty's brow more snows Than threescore winters in their natural course Might else have sprinkled there. It seems indeed That thou hast pass'd thy days in solitude, Replied the Abbot, or thou would'st not ask Of things so long gone by. Athanagild And Theudemir have taken on their necks The yoke. Sacaru play'd a nobler part. Long within Merida did he withstand The invader's hot assault; and when at length, Hopeless of all relief, he yielded up The gates, disdaining in his father's land To breathe the air of bondage, with a few Found faithful till the last, indignantly Did he toward the ocean bend his way, And shaking from his feet the dust of Spain, Took ship, and hoisted sail through seas unknown To seek for freedom. Our Cantabrian Chiefs All have submitted, but the wary Moor Trusteth not all alike: At his own Court He holds Pelayo, as suspecting most That calm and manly spirit; Pedro's son There too is held as hostage, and secures His father's faith; Count Eudon is despised, And so lives unmolested. When he pays His tribute, an uncomfortable thought May then perhaps disturb him: . . or more like He meditates how profitable 'twere To be a Moor; and if apostacy Were all, and to be unbaptized might serve, .. But I waste breath upon a wretch like this; Pelayo is the only hope of Spain, Only Pelayo. If, as we believe, Said Urban then, the hand of Heaven is here, And dreadful though they be, yet for wise end Of good, these visitations do its work; And dimly as our mortal sight may scan The future, yet methinks my soul descries How in Pelayo should the purposes Of Heaven be best accomplish'd. All too long, Here in their own inheritance, the sons Of Spain have groan'd beneath a foreign yoke, Punic and Roman, Kelt, and Goth, and Greek: This latter tempest comes to sweep away All proud distinctions which commingling blood And time's long course have fail'd to efface; and now Perchance it is the will of Fate to rear Upon the soil of Spain a Spanish throne, Restoring in Pelayo's native line The sceptre to the Spaniard. Go thou, then, And seek Pelayo at the Conqueror's court. Tell him the mountaineers are unsubdued; The precious time they needed hath been gain'd By Auria's sacrifice, and all they ask Is him to guide them on. In Odoar's name And Urban's, tell him that the hour is come. Then pausing for a moment, he pursued. The rule which thou hast taken on thyself Toledo ratifies: 'tis meet for Spain, And as the will divine, to be received, Observed, and spread abroad. Come hither thou, Who for thyself hast chosen the good part; Let me lay hands on thee, and consecrate Thy life unto the Lord. Me! Roderick cried; Me? sinner that I am! . . and while he spake His wither'd cheek grew paler, and his limbs Shook. As thou goest among the infidels, Pursued the Primate, many thou wilt find Fallen from the faith; by weakness some betray'd, Some led astray by baser hope of gain, And haply too by ill example led Of those in whom they trusted. Yet have these Their lonely hours, when sorrow, or the touch Of sickness, and that aweful power divine Which hath its dwelling in the heart of man, Life of his soul, his monitor and judge, Move them with silent impulse; but they look For help, and finding none to succour them, The irrevocable moment passeth by. Therefore, my brother, in the name of Christ Thus I lay hands on thee, that in His name Thou with His gracious promises may'st raise The fallen, and comfort those that are in need, And bring salvation to the penitent. Now, brother, go thy way: the peace of God Be with thee, and his blessing prosper us! V. RODERICK AND SIVERIAN. Between St. Felix and the regal seat Of Abdalazis, ancient Cordoba, Lay many a long day's journey interposed; And many a mountain range hath Roderick cross'd, And many a lovely vale, ere he beheld Where Betis, winding through the unbounded plain, Roll'd his majestic waters. There at eve Entering an inn, he took his humble seat With other travellers round the crackling earth, Where heath and cistus gave their flagrant flame. That flame no longer, as in other times, Lit up the countenance of easy mirth And light discourse: the talk which now went round Was of the grief that press'd on every heart; Of Spain subdued; the sceptre of the Goths Broken; their nation and their name effaced; Slaughter and mourning, which had left no house Unvisited; and shame, which set its mark On every Spaniard's face. One who had seen His sons fall bravely at his side, bewail'd The unhappy chance which, rescuing him from death, Left him the last of all his family; Yet he rejoiced to think that none who drew Their blood from him remain'd to wear the yoke, Be at the miscreant's beck, and propagate A breed of slaves to serve them. Here sate one Who told of fair possessions lost, and babes To goodly fortunes born, of all bereft. Another for a virgin daughter mourn'd, The lewd barbarian's spoil. A fourth had seen His only child forsake him in his age, And for a Moor renounce her hope in Christ. His was the heaviest grief of all, he said; And clenching as he spake his hoary locks, He cursed King Roderick's soul. Oh curse him not! Roderick exclaim'd, all shuddering as he spake. Oh, for the love of Jesus, curse him not! Sufficient is the dreadful load of guilt That lies upon his miserable soul! O brother, do not curse that sinful soul, Which Jesus suffer'd on the cross to save! But then an old man, who had sate thus long A silent listener, from his seat arose, And moving round to Roderick took his hand; Christ bless thee, brother, for that Christian speech, He said; and shame on me that any tongue Readier than mine was found to utter it! His own emotion fill'd him while he spake, So that he did not feel how Roderick's hand Shook like a palsied limb; and none could see How, at his well-known voice, the countenance Of that poor traveller suddenly was changed, And sunk with deadlier paleness; for the flame Was spent, and from behind him, on the wall High hung, the lamp with feeble glimmering play'd. Oh it is ever thus! the old man pursued, The crimes and woes of universal Spain Are charged on him; and curses which should aim At living heads, pursue beyond the grave His poor unhappy soul! As if his sin Had wrought the fall of our old monarchy! As if the Musselmen in their career Would ne'er have overleapt the gulf which parts Iberia from the Mauritanian shore, If Julian had not beckon'd them! ... Alas! The evils which drew on our overthrow, Would soon by other means have wrought their end, Though Julian's daughter should have lived and died A virgin vow'd and veil'd. Touch not on that, Shrinking with inward shiverings at the thought, The penitent exclaim'd. Oh, if thou lovest The soul of Roderick, touch not on that deed! God in his mercy may forgive it him, But human tongue must never speak his name Without reproach and utter infamy, For that abhorred act. Even thou... But here Siverian taking up the word, brake off Unwittingly the incautious speech. Even I, Quoth he, who nursed him in his father's hall, .. Even I can only for that deed of shame Offer in agony my secret prayers. But Spain hath witness'd other crimes as foul: Have we not seen Favila's shameless wife, Throned in Witiza's ivory car, parade Our towns with regal pageantry, and bid The murderous tyrant in her husband's blood Dip his adulterous hand? Did we not see Pelayo, by that bloody king's pursuit, And that unnatural mother, from the land With open outcry, like an outlaw'd thief, Hunted? And saw ye not Theodofred, As through the streets I guided his dark steps, Roll mournfully toward the noon-day sun His blank and senseless eye-balls? Spain saw this, And suffer'd it! ... I seek not to excuse The sin of Roderick. Jesu, who beholds The burning tears I shed in solitude, Knows how I plead for him in midnight prayer. But if, when he victoriously revenged The wrongs of Chindasuintho's house, his sword Had not for mercy turn'd aside its edge, Oh what a day of glory had there been Upon the banks of Chrysus! Curse not him, Who in that fatal conflict to the last So valiantly maintain'd his country's cause; But if your sorrow needs must have its vent In curses, let your imprecations strike The caitiffs, who, when Roderick's hornëd helm Rose eminent amid the thickest fight, Betraying him who spared and trusted them, Forsook their King, their Country, and their God, And gave the Moor his conquest. Aye! they said, These were Witiza's hateful progeny; And in an evil hour the unhappy King Had spared the viperous brood. With that they talk'd How Sisibert and Ebba through the land Guided the foe: and Orpas, who had cast The mitre from his renegado brow, Went with the armies of the infidels; And how in Hispalis, even where his hands Had minister'd so oft the bread of life, The circumcised apostate did not shame To shew in open day his turban'd head. The Queen too, Egilona, one exclaim'd; Was she not married to the enemy, The Moor, the Misbeliever? What a heart Were hers, that she could pride and plume herself To rank among his herd of concubines, Having been what she had been! And who could say How far domestic wrongs and discontent Had wrought upon the King! ... Hereat the old man, Raising beneath the knit and curly brow His mournful eyes, replied, This I can tell, That that unquiet spirit and unblest, Though Roderick never told his sorrows, drove Rusilla from the palace of her son. She could not bear to see his generous mind Wither beneath the unwholesome influence, And cankering at the core. And I know well, That oft when she deplored his barren bed, The thought of Egilona's qualities Came like a bitter medicine for her grief, And to the extinction of her husband's line, Sad consolation, reconciled her heart. But Roderick, while they communed thus, had ceased To hear, such painfulest anxiety The sight of that old venerable man Awoke. A sickening fear came over him: The hope which led him from his hermitage Now seem'd for ever gone, for well he knew Nothing but death could break the ties which bound That faithful servant to his father's house. She then for whose forgiveness he had yearn'd, Who in her blessing would have given and found The peace of Heaven, . . she then was to the grave Gone down disconsolate at last; in this Of all the woes of her unhappy life Unhappiest, that she did not live to see God had vouchsafed repentance to her child. But then a hope arose that yet she lived; The weighty cause which led Siverian here Might draw him from her side; better to know The worst than fear it. And with that he bent Over the embers, and with head half raised Aslant, and shadow'd by his hand, he said, Where is King Roderick's mother? lives she still? God hath upheld her, the old man replied; She bears this last and heaviest of her griefs, Not as she bore her husband's wrongs, when hope And her indignant heart supported her; But patiently, like one who finds from Heaven A comfort which the world can neither give Nor take away.... Roderick inquired no more; He breathed a silent prayer in gratitude, Then wrapt his cloak around him, and lay down Where he might weep unseen. When morning came, Earliest of all the travellers he went forth, And linger'd for Siverian by the way, Beside a fountain, where the constant fall Of water its perpetual gurgling made, To the wayfaring or the musing man Sweetest of all sweet sounds. The Christian hand, Whose general charity for man and beast Built it in better times, had with a cross Of well-hewn stone crested the pious work, Which now the misbelievers had cast down, And broken in the dust it lay defiled. Roderick beheld it lying at his feet, And gathering reverently the fragments up, Placed them within the cistern, and restored With careful collocation its dear form, .. So might the waters, like a crystal shrine, Preserve it from pollution. Kneeling then, O'er the memorial of redeeming love He bent, and mingled with the fount his tears, And pour'd his spirit to the Crucified. A Moor came by, and seeing him, exclaim'd, Ah, Kaffer! worshipper of wood and stone, God's curse confound thee! And as Roderick turn'd His face, the miscreant spurn'd him with his foot Between the eyes. The indignant King arose, And fell'd him to the ground. But then the Moor Drew forth his dagger, rising as he cried, What, darëst thou, thou infidel and slave, Strike a believer? and he aim'd a blow At Roderick's breast. But Roderick caught his arm, And closed, and wrench'd the dagger from his hold, .. Such timely strength did those emaciate limbs From indignation draw, . . and in his neck With mortal stroke he drove the avenging steel Hilt deep. Then, as the thirsty sand drank in The expiring miscreant's blood, he look'd around In sudden apprehension, lest the Moors Had seen them; but Siverian was in sight, The only traveller, and he smote his mule And hasten'd up. Ah, brother! said the old man, Thine is a spirit of the ancient mould! And would to God a thousand men like thee Had fought at Roderick's side on that last day When treason overpower'd him! Now, alas! A manly Gothic heart doth ill accord With these unhappy times. Come, let us hide This carrion, while the favouring hour permits. So saying he alighted. Soon they scoop'd Amid loose-lying sand a hasty grave, And levell'd over it the easy soil. Father, said Roderick, as they journey'd on, Let this thing be a seal and sacrament Of truth between us: Wherefore should there be Concealment between two right Gothic hearts In evil days like ours? What thou hast seen Is but the first fruit of the sacrifice, Which on this injured and polluted soil, As on a bloody altar, I have sworn To offer to insulted Heaven for Spain, Her vengeance and her expiation. This Was but a hasty act, by sudden wrong Provoked: but I am bound for Cordoba, On weighty mission from Visonia sent, To breathe into Pelayo's ear a voice Of spirit-stirring power, which like the trump Of the Arch-angel, shall awake dead Spain. The northern mountaineers are unsubdued; They call upon Pelayo for their chief; Odoar and Urban tell him that the hour Is come. Thou too, I ween, old man, art charged With no light errand, or thou wouldst not now Have left the ruins of thy master's house. Who art thou? cried Siverian, as he search'd The wan and wither'd features of the King. The face is of a stranger, but thy voice Disturbs me like a dream. Roderick replied, Thou seest me as I am, . . a stranger; one Whose fortunes in the general wreck were lost, His name and lineage utterly extinct, Himself in mercy spared, surviving all; .. In mercy, that the bitter cup might heal A soul diseased. Now, having cast the slough Of old offences, thou beholdest me A man new-born; in second baptism named, Like those who in Judea bravely raised Against the Heathen's impious tyranny The banner of Jehovah, Maccabee; So call me. In that name hath Urban laid His consecrating hands upon my head; And in that name have I myself for Spain Devoted. Tell me now why thou art sent To Cordoba; for sure thou goëst not An idle gazer to the Conqueror's court. Thou judgest well, the old man replied. I too Seek the Cantabrian Prince, the hope of Spain, With other tidings charged, for other end Design'd, yet such as well may work with thine. My noble Mistress sends me to avert The shame that threats his house. The renegade Numacian, he who for the infidels Oppresses Gegio, insolently woos His sister. Moulded in a wicked womb, The unworthy Guisla hath inherited Her Mother's leprous taint; and willingly She to the circumcised and upstart slave, Disdaining all admonishment, gives ear. The Lady Gaudiosa sees in this, With the quick foresight of maternal care, The impending danger to her husband's house, Knowing his generous spirit ne'er will brook The base alliance. Guisla lewdly sets His will at nought; but that vile renegade, From hatred, and from avarice, and from fear, Will seek the extinction of Pelayo's line. This too my venerable Mistress sees; Wherefore these valiant and high-minded dames Send me to Cordoba; that if the Prince Cannot by timely interdiction stop The irrevocable act of infamy, He may at least to his own safety look, Being timely warn'd. Thy Mistress sojourns then With Gaudiosa, in Pelayo's hall? Said Roderick. 'Tis her natural home, rejoin'd Siverian: Chindasuintho's royal race Have ever shared one lot of weal or woe: And she who hath beheld her own fair shoot, The goodly summit of that ancient tree, Struck by Heaven's bolt, seeks shelter now beneath The only branch of its majestic stem That still survives the storm. Thus they pursued Their journey, each from other gathering store For thought, with many a silent interval Of mournful meditation, till they saw The temples and the towers of Cordoba Shining majestic in the light of eve. Before them Betis roll'd his glittering stream, In many a silvery winding traced afar Amid the ample plain. Behind the walls And stately piles which crown'd its margin, rich With olives, and with sunny slope of vines, And many a lovely hamlet interspersed, Whose citron bowers were once the abode of peace, Height above height, receding hills were seen Imbued with evening hues; and over all The summits of the dark sierra rose, Lifting their heads amid the silent sky. The traveller who with a heart at ease Had seen the goodly vision, would have loved To linger, seeking with insatiate sight To treasure up its image, deep impress'd, A joy for years to come. O Cordoba, Exclaim'd the old man, how princely are thy towers, How fair thy vales, thy hills how beautiful! The sun who sheds on thee his parting smiles Sees not in all his wide career a scene Lovelier, nor more exuberantly blest By bounteous earth and heaven. The very gales Of Eden waft not from the immortal bowers Odours to sense more exquisite, than these Which, breathing from thy groves and gardens, now Recall in me such thoughts of bitterness. The time has been when happy was their lot Who had their birthright here; but happy now Are they who to thy bosom are gone home, Because they feel not in their graves the feet That trample upon Spain. 'Tis well that age Hath made me like a child, that I can weep: My heart would else have broken, overcharged, And I, false servant, should lie down to rest Before my work is done. Hard by their path, A little way without the walls, there stood An edifice, whereto, as by a spell, Siverian's heart was drawn. Brother, quoth he, 'Tis like the urgency of our return Will brook of no retardment; and this spot It were a sin if I should pass, and leave Unvisited. Beseech you turn with me, The while I offer up one duteous prayer. Roderick made no reply. He had not dared To turn his face toward those walls; but now He follow'd where the old man led the way. Lord! in his heart the silent sufferer said, Forgive my feeble soul, which would have shrunk From this, . . for what am I that I should put The bitter cup aside! O let my shame And anguish be accepted in thy sight! VI. RODERICK IN TIMES PAST. The mansion whitherward they went, was one Which in his youth Theodofred had built: Thither had he brought home in happy hour His blooming bride; there fondled on his knee The lovely boy she bore him. Close beside, A temple to that Saint he rear'd, who first, As old tradition tells, proclaim'd to Spain The gospel-tidings; and in health and youth, There mindful of mortality, he saw His sepulchre prepared. Witiza took For his adulterous leman and himself The stately pile: but to that sepulchre, When from captivity and darkness death Enlarged him, was Theodofred consign'd; For that unhappy woman, wasting then Beneath a mortal malady, at heart Was smitten, and the Tyrant at her prayer This poor and tardy restitution made. Soon the repentant sinner follow'd him; And calling on Pelayo ere she died, For his own wrongs, and for his father's death, Implored forgiveness of her absent child, .. If it were possible he could forgive Crimes black as her's, she said. And by the pangs Of her remorse, . . by her last agonies, .. The unutterable horrors of her death, .. And by the blood of Jesus on the cross For sinners given, did she beseech his prayers In aid of her most miserable soul. Thus mingling sudden shrieks with hopeless vows, And uttering franticly Pelayo's name, And crying out for mercy in despair, Here had she made her dreadful end, and here Her wretched body was deposited. That presence seem'd to desecrate the place: Thenceforth the usurper shunn'd it with the heart Of conscious guilt; nor could Rusilla bear These groves and bowers, which, like funereal shades, Opprest her with their monumental forms: One day of bitter and severe delight, When Roderick came for vengeance, she endured, And then for ever left her bridal halls. Oh when I last beheld yon princely pile, Exclaim'd Siverian, with what other thoughts Full, and elate of spirit, did I pass Its joyous gates! The weedery which through The interstices of those neglected courts Uncheck'd had flourish'd long, and seeded there, Was trampled then and bruised beneath the feet Of thronging crowds. Here drawn in fair array, The faithful vassals of my master's house, Their javelins sparkling to the morning sun, Spread their triumphant banners; high-plumed helms Rose o'er the martial ranks, and prancing steeds Made answer to the trumpet's stirring voice; While yonder towers shook the dull silence off Which long to their deserted walls had clung, And with redoubling echoes swell'd the shout That hail'd victorious Roderick. Louder rose The acclamation, when the dust was seen Rising beneath his chariot-wheels far off; But nearer as the youthful hero came, All sounds of all the multitude were hush'd, And from the thousands and ten thousands here, Whom Cordoba and Hispalis sent forth, .. Yea whom all Bætica, all Spain pour'd out To greet his triumph, ... not a whisper rose To Heaven, such awe and reverence master'd them, Such expectation held them motionless. Conqueror and King he came; but with no joy Of conquest, and no pride of sovereignty That day display'd; for at his father's grave Did Roderick come to offer up his vow Of vengeance well perform'd. Three coal-black steeds Drew on his ivory chariot: by his side, Still wrapt in mourning for the long-deceased, Rusilla state; a deeper paleness blanch'd Her faded countenance, but in her eye The light of her majestic nature shone. Bound, and expecting at their hands the death So well deserved, Witiza follow'd them; Aghast and trembling, first he gazed around, Wildly from side to side; then from the face Of universal execration shrunk, Hanging his wretched head abased; and poor Of spirit, with unmanly tears deplored His fortune, not his crimes. With bolder front, Confiding in his priestly character, Came Orpas next; and then the spurious race Whom in unhappy hour Favila's wife Brought forth for Spain. O mercy ill bestow'd, When Roderick, in compassion for their youth, And for Pelayo's sake, forebore to crush The brood of vipers! Err perchance he might, Replied the Goth, suppressing as he spake All outward signs of pain, though every word Went like a dagger to his bleeding heart; .. But sure, I ween, that error is not placed Among his sins. Old man, thou mayest regret The mercy ill deserved, and worse return'd, But not for this wouldst thou reproach the King! Reproach him? cried Siverian; . . I reproach My child, . . my noble boy, . . whom every tongue Bless'd at that hour, . . whose love fill'd every heart With joy, and every eye with joyful tears! My brave, my beautiful, my generous boy! Brave, beautiful, and generous as he was, Never so brave, so beautiful, so great As then, . . not even on that glorious day, When on the field of victory, elevate Amid the thousands who acclaim'd him King, Firm on the shield above their heads upraised, Erect he stood, and waved his bloody sword... Why dost thou shake thy head as if in doubt? I do not dream, nor fable! Ten short years Have scarcely past away, since all within The Pyrenean hills, and the three seas Which girdle Spain, echoed in one response The acclamation from that field of fight... Or doth aught ail thee, that thy body quakes And shudders thus? 'Tis but a chill, replied The King, in passing from the open air Under the shadow of this thick-set grove. Oh! if this scene awoke in thee such thoughts As swell my bosom here, the old man pursued, Sunshine, or shade, and all things from without, Would be alike indifferent. Gracious God, Only but ten short years, . . and all so changed! Ten little years since in yon court he check'd His fiery steeds. The steeds obey'd his hand, The whirling wheels stood still, and when he leapt Upon the pavement, the whole people heard, In their deep silence, open-ear'd, the sound. With slower movement from the ivory seat Rusilla rose, her arm, as down she stept, Extended to her son's supporting hand; Not for default of firm or agile strength, But that the feeling of that solemn hour Subdued her then, and tears bedimm'd her sight. Howbeit when to her husband's grave she came, On the sepulchral stone she bow'd her head Awhile; then rose collectedly, and fix'd Upon the scene her calm and steady eye. Roderick, . . oh when did valour wear a form So beautiful, so noble, so august? Or vengeance, when did it put on before A character so aweful, so divine? Roderick stood up, and reaching to the tomb His hands, my hero cried, Theodofred! Father! I stand before thee once again, According to thy prayer, when kneeling down Between thy knees I took my last farewell; And vow'd by all thy sufferings, all thy wrongs, And by my mother's days and nights of woe, Her silent anguish, and the grief which then Even from thee she did not seek to hide, That if our cruel parting should avail To save me from the Tyrant's jealous guilt, Surely should my avenging sword fulfil Whate'er he omen'd. Oh that time, I cried, Would give the strength of manhood to this arm, Already would it find a manly heart To guide it to its purpose! And I swore Never again to see my father's face, Nor ask my mother's blessing, till I brought, Dead or in chains, the Tyrant to thy feet. Boy as I was, before all Saints in Heaven, And highest God, whose justice slumbereth not, I made the vow. According to thy prayer, In all things, O my father, is that vow Perform'd, alas too well! for thou didst pray, While looking up I felt the burning tears Which from thy sightless sockets stream'd, drop down, .. That to thy grave, and not thy living feet, The oppressor might be led. Behold him there, .. Father! Theodofred! no longer now In darkness, from thy heavenly seat look down, And see before thy grave thine enemy In bonds, awaiting judgment at my hand! Thus while the hero spake, Witiza stood Listening in agony, with open mouth, And head, half-raised, toward his sentence turn'd; His eye-lids stiffen'd and pursed up, . . his eyes Rigid, and wild, and wide; and when the King Had ceased, amid the silence which ensued, The dastard's chains were heard, link against link Clinking. At length upon his knees he fell, And lifting up his trembling hands, outstretch'd In supplication, . . Mercy! he exclaim'd, .. Chains, dungeons, darkness, . . any thing but death! .. I did not touch his life. Roderick replied, His hour, whenever it had come, had found A soul prepared: he lived in peace with Heaven, And life prolong'd for him, was bliss delay'd. But life, in pain and darkness and despair, For thee, all leprous as thou art with crimes, Is mercy... Take him hence, and let him see The light of day no more! Such Roderick was When last I saw these courts, . . his theatre Of glory; . . such when last I visited My master's grave! Ten years have hardly held Their course, . . ten little years.. break, break, old heart.. Oh why art thou so tough! As thus he spake They reach'd the church. The door before his hand Gave way; both blinded with their tears, they went Straight to the tomb; and there Siverian knelt, And bow'd his face upon the sepulchre, Weeping aloud; while Roderick, overpower'd, And calling upon earth to cover him, Threw himself prostrate on his father's grave. Thus as they lay, an aweful voice in tones Severe address'd them. Who are ye, it said, That with your passion thus, and on this night, Disturb my prayers? Starting they rose; there stood A man before them of majestic form And stature, clad in sackcloth, bare of foot, Pale, and in tears, with ashes on his head. VII. RODERICK AND PELAYO. 'Twas not in vain that on her absent son, Pelayo's mother from the bed of death Call'd for forgiveness, and in agony Besought his prayers; all guilty as she was, Sure he had not been human, if that cry Had fail'd to pierce him. When he heard the tale He bless'd the messenger, even while his speech Was faltering, . . while from head to foot he shook With icey feelings from his inmost heart Effused. It changed the nature of his woe, Making the burthen more endurable: The life-long sorrow that remain'd, became A healing and a chastening grief, and brought His soul, in close communion, nearer Heaven. For he had been her first-born, and the love Which at her breast he drew, and from her smiles, And from her voice of tenderness imbibed, Gave such unnatural horror to her crimes, That when the thought came over him, it seem'd As if the milk which with his infant life Had blended, thrill'd like poison through his frame. It was a woe beyond all reach of hope, Till with the dreadful tale of her remorse Faith touch'd his heart; and ever from that day Did he for her who bore him, night and morn, Pour out the anguish of his soul in prayer: But chiefly as the night return'd, which heard Her last expiring groans of penitence, Then through the long and painful hours, before The altar, like a penitent himself, He kept his vigils; and when Roderick's sword Subdued Witiza, and the land was free, Duly upon her grave he offer'd up His yearly sacrifice of agony And prayer. This was the night, and he it was Who now before Siverian and the King Stood up in sackcloth. The old man, from fear Recovering and from wonder, knew him first. It is the Prince! he cried, and bending down Embraced his knees. The action and the word Awaken'd Roderick; he shook off the load Of struggling thoughts, which pressing on his heart, Held him like one entranced; yet, all untaught To bend before the face of man, confused Awhile he stood, forgetful of his part. But when Siverian cried, My Lord, my Lord, Now God be praised that I have found thee thus, My Lord and Prince, Spain's only hope and mine! Then Roderick, echoing him, exclaim'd, My Lord, And Prince, Pelayo! . . and approaching near, He bent his knee obeisant: but his head Earthward inclined; while the old man, looking up From his low gesture to Pelayo's face, Wept at beholding him for grief and joy. Siverian! cried the chief, . . of whom hath Death Bereaved me, that thou comest to Cordoba? .. Children, or wife? . . Or hath the merciless scythe Of this abhorr'd and jealous tyranny Made my house desolate at one wide sweep? They are as thou couldst wish, the old man replied, Wert thou but lord of thine own house again, And Spain were Spain once more. A tale of ill I bear, but one that touches not the heart Like what thy fears forebode. The renegade Numacian woos thy sister, and she lends To the vile slave, unworthily, her ear: The Lady Gaudiosa hath in vain Warn'd her of all the evils which await A union thus accurst: she sets at nought Her faith, her lineage, and thy certain wrath. Pelayo hearing him, remain'd awhile Silent; then turning to his mother's grave, .. O thou poor dust, hath then the infectious taint Survived thy dread remorse, that it should run In Guisla's veins? he cried; . . I should have heard This shameful sorrow any where but here! .. Humble thyself, proud heart; thou, gracious Heaven, Be merciful! . . it is the original flaw, .. And what are we? . . a weak unhappy race, Born to our sad inheritance of sin And death! . . He smote his forehead as he spake, And from his head the ashes fell, like snow Shaken from some dry beech-leaves, when a bird Lights on the bending spray. A little while In silence, rather than in thought, he stood Passive beneath the sorrow: turning then, And what doth Gaudiosa counsel me? He ask'd the old man; for she hath ever been My wise and faithful counsellor... He replied, The Lady Gaudiosa bade me say She sees the danger which on every part Besets her husband's house.. Here she had ceased; But when my noble Mistress gave in charge, How I should tell thee that in evil times The bravest counsels ever are the best; Then that high-minded Lady thus rejoin'd, Whatever be my Lord's resolve, he knows I bear a mind prepared. Brave spirits! cried Pelayo, worthy to remove all stain Of weakness from their sex! I should be less Than man, if, drawing strength where others find Their hearts most open to assault of fear, I quail'd at danger. Never be it said Of Spain, that in the hour of her distress Her women were as heroes, but her men Perform'd the woman's part. Roderick at that Look'd up, and taking up the word, exclaim'd, O Prince, in better days the pride of Spain, And prostrate as she lies, her surest hope, Hear now my tale. The fire which seem'd extinct Hath risen revigorate: a living spark From Auria's ashes, by a woman's hand Preserved and quicken'd, kindles far and wide The beacon-flame o'er all the Asturian hills. There hath a vow been offer'd up, which binds Us and our children's children to the work Of holy hatred. In the name of Spain That vow hath been pronounced, and register'd Above, to be the bond whereby we stand For condemnation or acceptance. Heaven Received the irrevocable vow, and Earth Must witness its fulfilment; Earth and Heaven Call upon thee, Pelayo! Upon thee The spirits of thy royal ancestors Look down expectant; unto thee, from fields Laid waste, and hamlets burnt, and cities sack'd, The blood of infancy and helpless age Cries out; thy native mountains call for thee, Echoing from all their armëd sons thy name. And deem not thou that hot impatience goads Thy countrymen to counsels immature. Odoar and Urban from Visonia's banks Send me, their sworn and trusted messenger, To summon thee, and tell thee in their name That now the hour is come: For sure it seems, Thus saith the Primate, Heaven's high will to rear Upon the soil of Spain a Spanish throne, Restoring in thy native line, O Prince, The sceptre to the Spaniard. Worthy son Of that most ancient and heroic race, Which with unweariable endurance still Hath striven against its mightier enemies, Roman or Carthaginian, Greek or Goth; So often by superior arms oppress'd, More often by superior arts beguiled; Yet amid all its sufferings, all the waste Of sword and fire remorselessly employ'd, Unconquer'd and unconquerable still; .. Son of that injured and illustrious stock, Stand forward thou, draw forth the sword of Spain, Restore them to their rights, too long withheld, And place upon thy brow the Spanish crown. When Roderick ceased, the princely Mountaineer Gazed on the passionate orator awhile, With eyes intently fix'd, and thoughtful brow; Then turning to the altar, he let fall The sackcloth robe, which late with folded arms Against his heart was prest; and stretching forth His hands toward the crucifix, exclaim'd, My God and my Redeemer! where but here, Before thy aweful presence, in this garb, With penitential ashes thus bestrewn, Could I so fitly answer to the call Of Spain; and for her sake, and in thy name, Accept the Crown of Thorns she proffers me! And where but here, said Roderick in his heart, Could I so properly, with humbled knee And willing soul, confirm my forfeiture? .. The action follow'd on that secret thought: He knelt, and took Pelayo's hand, and cried, First of the Spaniards, let me with this kiss Do homage to thee here, my Lord and King! . With voice unchanged and steady countenance He spake; but when Siverian follow'd him, The old man trembled as his lips pronounced The faltering vow; and rising he exclaim'd, God grant thee, O my Prince, a better fate Than thy poor kinsman's, who in happier days Received thy homage here! Grief choak'd his speech And, bursting into tears, he sobb'd aloud. Tears too adown Pelayo's manly cheek Roll'd silently. Roderick alone appear'd Unmoved and calm; for now the royal Goth Had offer'd his accepted sacrifice, And therefore in his soul he felt that peace Which follows painful duty well perform'd, .. Perfect and heavenly peace, . . the peace of God. VIII. ALPHONSO. Fain would Pelayo have that hour obey'd The call, commencing his adventurous flight, As one whose soul impatiently endured His country's thraldom, and in daily prayer Imploring her deliverance, cried to Heaven, How long, O Lord, how long! . . But other thoughts Curbing his spirit, made him yet awhile Sustain the weight of bondage. Him alone, Of all the Gothic baronage, the Moors Watch'd with regard of wary policy, .. Knowing his powerful name, his noble mind, And how in him the old Iberian blood, Of royal and remotest ancestry, From undisputed source flow'd undefiled; His mother's after-guilt attainting not The claim legitimate he derived from her, Her first-born in her time of innocence. He too of Chindasuintho's regal line Sole remnant now, drew after him the love Of all true Goths, uniting in himself Thus by this double right, the general heart Of Spain. For this the renegado crew, Wretches in whom their conscious guilt and fear Engender'd cruellest hatred, still advised The extinction of Pelayo's house; but most The apostate Prelate, in iniquity Witiza's genuine brother as in blood, Orpas, pursued his life. He never ceased With busy zeal, true traitor, to infuse His deadly rancour in the Moorish chief; Their only danger, ever he observed, Was from Pelayo; root his lineage out, The Caliph's empire then would be secure, And universal Spain, all hope of change Being lost, receive the Prophet's conquering law. Then did the Arch-villain urge the Moor at once To cut off future peril, telling him Death was a trusty keeper, and that none E'er broke the prison of the grave. But here Keen malice overshot its mark: the Moor, Who from the plunder of their native land Had bought the recreant crew that join'd his arms, Or cheaplier with their own possessions bribed Their sordid souls, saw through the flimsy show Of policy wherewith they sought to cloak Old enmity, and selfish aims: he scorn'd To let their private purposes incline His counsels, and believing Spain subdued, Smiled, in the pride of power and victory, Disdainful at the thought of farther strife. Howbeit he held Pelayo at his court, And told him that until his countrymen Submissively should lay their weapons down, He from his children and paternal hearth Apart must dwell; nor hope to see again His native mountains and their vales beloved, Till all the Asturian and Cantabrian hills Had bow'd before the Caliph; Cordoba Must be his nightly prison till that hour. This night, by special favour from the Moor Ask'd and vouchsafed, he pass'd without the walls Keeping his yearly vigil; on this night Therefore the princely Spaniard could not fly, Being thus in strongest bonds by honour held; Nor would he by his own escape expose To stricter bondage, or belike to death, Count Pedro's son. The ancient enmity Of rival houses from Pelayo's heart Had, like a thing forgotten, pass'd away; He pitied child and parent, separated By the stern mandate of unfeeling power, And almost with a father's eyes beheld The boy, his fellow in captivity. For young Alphonso was in truth an heir Of nature's largest patrimony; rich In form and feature, growing strength of limb, A gentle heart, a soul affectionate, A joyous spirit fill'd with generous thoughts, And genius heightening and ennobling all; The blossom of all manly virtues made His boyhood beautiful. Shield, gracious Heaven, In this ungenial season perilous, .. Thus would Pelayo sometimes breathe in prayer The aspirations of prophetic hope, .. Shield, gracious Heaven, the blooming tree! and let This goodly promise, for thy people's sake, Yield its abundant fruitage. When the Prince, With hope and fear and grief and shame disturb'd, And sad remembrance, and the shadowy light Of days before him, thronging as in dreams, Whose quick succession fill'd and overpower'd Awhile the unresisting faculty, Could in the calm of troubled thoughts subdued Seek in his heart for counsel, his first care Was for the boy; how best they might evade The Moor, and renegade's more watchful eye; And leaving in some unsuspicious guise The city, through what unfrequented track Safeliest pursue with speed their dangerous way. Consumed in cares like these, the fleeting hours Went by. The lamps and tapers now grew pale, And through the eastern window slanting fell The roseate ray of morn. Within those walls Returning day restored no cheerful sounds Or joyous motions of awakening life; But in the stream of light the speckled motes As if in mimicry of insect play, Floated with mazy movement. Sloping down Over the altar pass'd the pillar'd beam, And rested on the sinful woman's grave As if it enter'd there, a light from Heaven. So be it! cried Pelayo, even so! As in a momentary interval, When thought expelling thought, had left his mind Open and passive to the influxes Of outward sense, his vacant eye was there, .. So be it, Heavenly Father, even so! Thus may thy vivifying goodness shed Forgiveness there; for let not thou the groans Of dying penitence, nor my bitter prayers Before thy mercy-seat, be heard in vain! And thou, poor soul, who from the dolorous house Of weeping and of pain, dost look to me To shorten and assuage thy penal term, Pardon me that these hours in other thoughts And other duties than this garb, this night Enjoin, should thus have past! Our mother-land Exacted of my heart the sacrifice; And many a vigil must thy son perform Henceforth in woods and mountain fastnesses, And tented fields, outwatching for her sake The starry host, and ready for the work Of day, before the sun begins his course. The noble Mountaineer, concluding then With silent prayer the service of the night, Went forth. Without the porch awaiting him He saw Alphonso, pacing to and fro With patient step and eye reverted oft. He, springing forward when he heard the door Move on its heavy hinges, ran to him, And welcomed him with smiles of youthful love. I have been watching yonder moon, quoth he, How it grew pale and paler as the sun Scatter'd the flying shades; but woe is me, For on the towers of Cordoba the while That baleful crescent glitter'd in the morn, And with its insolent triumph seem'd to mock The omen I had found... Last night I dreamt That thou wert in the field in arms for Spain, And I was at thy side: the infidels Beset us round, but we with our good swords Hew'd out a way. Methought I stabb'd a Moor Who would have slain thee; but with that I woke For joy, and wept to find it but a dream. Thus as he spake a livelier glow o'erspread His cheek, and starting tears again suffused The brightening lustre of his eyes. The Prince Regarded him a moment stedfastly, As if in quick resolve; then looking round On every side with keen and rapid glance, Drew him within the church. Alphonso's heart Throbb'd with a joyful boding as he mark'd The calmness of Pelayo's countenance Kindle with solemn thoughts, expressing now High purposes of resolute hope. He gazed All eagerly to hear what most he wish'd. If, said the Prince, thy dream were verified, And I indeed were in the field in arms For Spain, . . wouldst thou be at Pelayo's side? .. If I should break these bonds, and fly to rear Our country's banner on our native hills, Wouldst thou, Alphonso, share my dangerous flight, Dear boy, . . and wilt thou take thy lot with me For death, or for deliverance? Shall I swear? Replied the impatient boy; and laying hand Upon the altar, on his knee he bent, Looking towards Pelayo with such joy Of reverential love, as if a God Were present to receive the eager vow. Nay, quoth Pelayo: what hast thou to do With oaths? . . Bright emanation as thou art, It were a wrong to thy unsullied soul, A sin to nature, were I to require Promise or vow from thee! Enough for me That thy heart answers to the stirring call. Alphonso, follow thou in happy faith Alway the indwelling voice that counsels thee; And then, let fall the issue as it may, Shall all thy paths be in the light of Heaven, The peace of Heaven be with thee in all hours. How then, exclaim'd the boy, shall I discharge The burthen of this happiness, . . how ease My overflowing soul! . . Oh gracious God, Shall I behold my mother's face again, .. My father's hall, . . my native hills and vales, And hear the voices of their streams again, .. And free as I was born amid those scenes Beloved, maintain my country's freedom there, .. Or, failing in the sacred enterprise, Die as becomes a Spaniard? ... Saying thus, He lifted up his hands and eyes toward The image of the Crucified, and cried, O Thou who didst with thy most precious blood Redeem us, Jesu! help us while we seek Earthly redemption from this yoke of shame And misbelief and death. The noble boy Then rose, and would have knelt again to clasp Pelayo's knees, and kiss his hand in act Of homage; but the Prince, preventing this, Bent over him in fatherly embrace, And breathed a fervent blessing on his head. IX. FLORINDA. There sate a woman like a supplicant, Muffled and cloak'd, before Pelayo's gate, Awaiting when he should return that morn. She rose at his approach, and bow'd her head, And, with a low and trembling utterance, Besought him to vouchsafe her speech within In privacy. And when they were alone, And the doors closed, she knelt and claspt his knees, Saying, a boon! a boon! This night, O Prince, Hast thou kept vigil for thy mother's soul: For her soul's sake, and for the soul of him Whom once, in happier days, of all mankind Thou heldest for thy chosen bosom friend, Oh for the sake of his poor suffering soul, Refuse me not! How should I dare refuse, Being thus adjured? he answer'd. Thy request Is granted, woman, . . be it what it may, So it be lawful, and within the bounds Of possible atchievement: . . aught unfit Thou wouldst not with these adjurations seek. But who thou art, I marvel, that dost touch Upon that string, and ask in Roderick's name! .. She bared her face, and, looking up, replied, Florinda! . . Shrinking then, with both her hands She hid herself, and bow'd her head abased Upon her knee, . . as one who, if the grave Had oped beneath her, would have thrown herself, Even like a lover, in the arms of Death. Pelayo stood confused: he had not seen Count Julian's daughter since in Roderick's court, Glittering in beauty and in innocence, A radiant vision, in her joy she moved; More like a poet's dream, or form divine, Heaven's prototype of perfect womanhood, So lovely was the presence, . . than a thing Of earth and perishable elements. Now had he seen her in her winding-sheet, Less painful would that spectacle have proved; For peace is with the dead, and piety Bringeth a patient hope to those who mourn O'er the departed; but this alter'd face, Bearing its deadly sorrow character'd, Came to him like a ghost, which in the grave Could find no rest. He, taking her cold hand, Raised her, and would have spoken; but his tongue Fail'd in its office, and could only speak In under tones compassionate her name. The voice of pity soothed and melted her; And when the Prince bade her be comforted, Proffering his zealous aid in whatsoe'er Might please her to appoint, a feeble smile Pass'd slowly over her pale countenance, Like moonlight on a marble statue. Heaven Requite thee, Prince! she answer'd. All I ask Is but a quiet resting-place, wherein A broken heart, in prayer and humble hope, May wait for its deliverance. Even this My most unhappy fate denies me here. Griefs which are known too widely and too well I need not now remember. I could bear Privation of all Christian ordinances, The woe which kills hath saved me too, and made A temple of this ruin'd tabernacle, Wherein redeeming God doth not disdain To let his presence shine. And I could bear To see the turban on my father's brow, .. Sorrow beyond all sorrows, . . shame of shames, .. Yet to be borne, while I with tears of blood, And throes of agony, in his behalf Implore and wrestle with offended Heaven. This I have borne resign'd: but other ills And worse assail me now; the which to bear, If to avoid be possible, would draw Damnation down. Orpas, the perjured Priest, The apostate Orpas, claims me for his bride. Obdurate as he is, the wretch profanes My sacred woe, and woos me to his bed, The thing I am, . . the living death thou seest! Miscreant! exclaim'd Pelayo. Might I meet That renegado, sword to scymitar, In open field, never did man approach The altar for the sacrifice in faith More sure, than I should hew the villain down! But how should Julian favour his demand? .. Julian, who hath so passionately loved His child, so dreadfully revenged her wrongs! Count Julian, she replied, hath none but me, And it hath, therefore, been his heart's desire To see his ancient line by me preserved. This was their covenant when in fatal hour For Spain, and for themselves, in traitorous bond Of union they combined. My father, stung To madness, only thought of how to make His vengeance sure; the Prelate, calm and cool, When he renounced his outward faith in Christ, Indulged at once his hatred of the King, His inbred wickedness, and a haughty hope, Versed as he was in treasons, to direct The invaders by his secret policy, And at their head, aided by Julian's power, Reign as a Moor upon that throne to which The priestly order else had barr'd his way. The African hath conquer'd for himself; But Orpas coveteth Count Julian's lands, And claims to have the covenant perform'd. Friendless, and worse than fatherless, I come To thee for succour. Send me secretly, .. For well I know all faithful hearts must be At thy devotion, . . with a trusty guide To guard me on the way, that I may reach Some Christian land, where Christian rites are free, And there discharge a vow, alas! too long, Too fatally delay'd. Aid me in this For Roderick's sake, Pelayo! and thy name Shall be remember'd in my latest prayer. Be comforted! the Prince replied; but when He spake of comfort, twice did he break off The idle words, feeling that earth had none For grief so irremediable as hers. At length he took her hand, and pressing it, And forcing through involuntary tears A mournful smile affectionate, he said, Say not that thou art friendless while I live! Thou couldst not to a readier ear have told Thy sorrows, nor have ask'd in fitter hour What for my country's honour, for my rank, My faith, and sacred knighthood, I am bound In duty to perform; which not to do Would show me undeserving of the names Of Goth, Prince, Christian, even of Man. This day, Lady, prepare to take thy lot with me, And soon as evening closes meet me here. Duties bring blessings with them, and I hold Thy coming for a happy augury, In this most aweful crisis of my fate. X. RODERICK AND FLORINDA. With sword and breast-plate, under rustic weeds Conceal'd, at dusk Pelayo pass'd the gate, Florinda following near, disguised alike. Two peasants on their mules they seem'd, at eve Returning from the town. Not distant far, Alphonso by the appointed orange-grove, With anxious eye and agitated heart, Watch'd for the Prince's coming. Eagerly At every foot-fall through the gloom he strain'd His sight, nor did he recognize him when The Chieftain thus accompanied drew nigh; And when the expected signal called him on, Doubting this female presence, half in fear Obey'd the call. Pelayo too perceived The boy was not alone; he not for that Delay'd the summons, but lest need should be, Laying hand upon his sword, toward him bent In act soliciting speech, and low of voice Enquired if friend or foe. Forgive me, cried Alphonso, that I did not tell thee this, Full as I was of happiness, before. 'Tis Hoya, servant of my father's house, Unto whose dutiful care and love, when sent To this vile bondage, I was given in charge. How could I look upon my father's face If I had in my joy deserted him, Who was to me found faithful? . . Right! replied The Prince; and viewing him with silent joy, Blessed the Mother, in his heart he said, Who gave thee birth! but sure of womankind Most blessed she whose hand her happy stars Shall link with thine! and with that thought the form Of Hermesind, his daughter, to his soul Came in her beauty. Soon by devious tracks They turn'd aside. The favouring moon arose, To guide them on their flight through upland paths Remote from frequentage, and dales retired, Forest and mountain glen. Before their feet The fire-flies, swarming in the woodland shade, Sprung up like sparks, and twinkled round their way; The timorous blackbird, starting at their step, Fled from the thicket with shrill note of fear; And far below them in the peopled dell, When all the soothing sounds of eve had ceased, The distant watch-dog's voice at times was heard, Answering the nearer wolf. All through the night Among the hills they travell'd silently; Till when the stars were setting, at what hour The breath of Heaven is coldest, they beheld Within a lonely grove the expected fire, Where Roderick and his comrade anxiously Look'd for the appointed meeting. Halting there, They from the burthen and the bit relieved Their patient bearers, and around the fire Partook of needful food and grateful rest. Bright rose the flame replenish'd; it illumed The cork-tree's furrow'd rind, its rifts and swells And redder scars, . . and where its aged boughs O'erbower'd the travellers, cast upon the leaves A floating, grey, unrealizing gleam. Alphonso, light of heart, upon the heath Lay carelessly dispread, . in happy dreams Of home; his faithful Hoya slept beside. Years and fatigue to old Siverian brought Easy oblivion; and the Prince himself, Yielding to weary nature's gentle will, Forgot his cares awhile. Florinda sate Beholding Roderick with fix'd eyes intent, Yet unregardant of the countenance Whereon they dwelt; in other thoughts absorb'd, Collecting fortitude for what she yearn'd, Yet trembled to perform. Her steady look Disturb'd the Goth, albeit he little ween'd What agony awaited him that hour. Her face, well nigh as changed as his, was now Half-hidden, and the lustre of her eye Extinct; nor did her voice awaken in him One startling recollection when she spake, So altered were its tones. Father, she said, All thankful as I am to leave behind The unhappy walls of Cordoba, not less Of consolation doth my heart receive At sight of one to whom I may disclose The sins which trouble me, and at his feet Lay down repentantly, in Jesu's name, The burthen of my spirit. In his name Hear me, and pour into a wounded soul The balm of pious counsel... Saying thus, She drew toward the minister ordain'd, And kneeling by him, Father, dost thou know The wretch who kneels beside thee? she enquired, He answered, Surely we are each to each Equally unknown. Then said she, Here thou seest One who is known too fatally for all, .. The daughter of Count Julian.... Well it was For Roderick that no eye beheld him now; From head to foot a sharper pang than death Thrill'd him; his heart, as at a mortal stroke, Ceased from its functions: his breath fail'd, and when The power of life recovering set its springs Again in action, cold and clammy sweat Starting at every pore suffused his frame. Their presence help'd him to subdue himself; For else, had none been nigh, he would have fallen Before Florinda prostrate on the earth, And in that mutual agony belike Both souls had taken flight. She mark'd him not; For having told her name, she bow'd her head, Breathing a short and silent prayer to Heaven, While, as a penitent, she wrought herself To open to his eye her hidden wounds. Father, at length she said, all tongues amid This general ruin shed their bitterness On Roderick, load his memory with reproach, And with their curses persecute his soul.... Why shouldst thou tell me this? exclaim'd the Goth, From his cold forehead wiping as he spake The death-like moisture; . . Why of Roderick's guilt Tell me? Or thinkest thou I know it not? Alas! who hath not heard the hideous tale Of Roderick's shame! Babes learn it from their nurses, And children, by their mothers unreproved, Link their first execrations to his name. Oh, it hath caught a taint of infamy, That, like Iscariot's, through all time shall last, Reeking and fresh for ever! There! she cried, Drawing her body backward where she knelt, And stretching forth her arms with head upraised, .. There! it pursues me still! . . I came to thee, Father, for comfort, and thou heapest fire Upon my head. But hear me patiently, And let me undeceive thee; self-abased, Not to arraign another, do I come; .. I come a self-accuser, self-condemn'd To take upon myself the pain deserved; For I have drank the cup of bitterness, And having drank therein of heavenly grace, I must not put away the cup of shame. Thus as she spake she falter'd at the close, And in that dying fall her voice sent forth Somewhat of its original sweetness. Thou! .. Thou self-abased! exclaim'd the astonish'd King; .. Thou self-condemn'd! . . The cup of shame for thee! Thee.. thee, Florinda! ... But the very excess Of passion check'd his speech, restraining thus From farther transport, which had haply else Master'd him; and he sate like one entranced, Gazing upon that countenance so fallen, So changed: her face, raised from its muffler now, Was turn'd toward him, and the fire-light shone Full on its mortal paleness; but the shade Conceal'd the King. She roused him from the spell Which held him like a statue motionless. Thou too, quoth she, dost join the general curse, Like one who when he sees a felon's grave, Casting a stone there as he passes by, Adds to the heap of shame. Oh what are we, Frail creatures as we are, that we should sit In judgement man on man! and what were we, If the All-merciful should mete to us With the same rigorous measure wherewithal Sinner to sinner metes! But God beholds The secrets of the heart, . . therefore his name Is Merciful. Servant of God, see thou The hidden things of mine, and judge thou then In charity thy brother who hath fallen.... Nay, hear me to the end! I loved the King, .. Tenderly, passionately, madly loved him. Sinful it was to love a child of earth With such entire devotion as I loved Roderick, the heroic Prince, the glorious Goth! And yet methought this was its only crime, The imaginative passion seem'd so pure: Quiet and calm like duty, hope nor fear Disturb'd the deep contentment of that love; He was the sunshine of my soul, and like A flower, I lived and flourish'd in his light. Oh bear not with me thus impatiently! No tale of weakness this, that in the act Of penitence, indulgent to itself, With garrulous palliation half repeats The sin it ill repents. I will be brief, And shrink not from confessing how the love Which thus began in innocence, betray'd My unsuspecting heart; nor me alone, But him, before whom, shining as he shone With whatsoe'er is noble, whatsoe'er Is lovely, whatsoever good and great, I was as dust and ashes, . . him, alas! This glorious being, this exalted Prince, Even him, with all his royalty of soul, Did this ill-omen'd, this accursëd love, To his most lamentable fall betray And utter ruin. Thus it was: The King, By counsels of cold statesmen ill-advised, To an unworthy mate had bound himself In politic wedlock. Wherefore should I tell How Nature upon Egilona's form, Profuse of beauty, lavishing her gifts, Left, like a statue from the graver's hands, Deformity and hollowness beneath The rich external? For the love of pomp And emptiest vanity, hath she not incurr'd The grief and wonder of good men, the gibes Of vulgar ribaldry, the reproach of all; Profaning the most holy sacrament Of marriage, to become chief of the wives Of Abdalaziz, of the Infidel, The Moor, the tyrant-enemy of Spain! All know her now; but they alone who knew What Roderick was can judge his wretchedness, To that light spirit and unfeeling heart In hopeless bondage bound. No children rose From this unhappy union, towards whom The springs of love within his soul confined Might flow in joy and fulness; nor was he One, like Witiza, of the vulgar crew, Who in promiscuous appetite can find All their vile nature seeks. Alas for man! Exuberant health diseases him, frail worm! And the slight bias of untoward chance Makes his best virtue from the even line, With fatal declination, swerve aside. Aye, thou mayest groan for poor mortality, .. Well, Father, mayest thou groan! My evil fate Made me an inmate of the royal house, And Roderick found in me, if not a heart Like his, . . for who was like the heroic Goth? ... One which at least felt his surpassing worth, And loved him for himself.... A little yet Bear with me, reverend Father, for I touch Upon the point, and this long prologue goes, As justice bids, to palliate his offence, Not mine. The passion, which I fondly thought Such as fond sisters for a brother feel, Grew day by day, and strengthen'd in its growth, Till the beloved presence had become Needful as food or necessary sleep, My hope, light, sunshine, life, and every thing. Thus lapt in dreams of bliss, I might have lived Contented with this pure idolatry, Had he been happy: but I saw and knew The inward discontent and household griefs Which he subdued in silence; and alas! Pity with admiration mingling then, Alloy'd and lower'd and humanized my love, Till to the level of my lowliness It brought him down; and in this treacherous heart Too often the repining thought arose, That if Florinda had been Roderick's Queen, Then might domestic peace and happiness Have bless'd his home and crown'd our wedded loves. Too often did that sinful thought recur, Too feebly the temptation was repell'd. See, Father, I have probed my inmost soul; Have search'd to its remotest source the sin; And tracing it through all its specious forms Of fair disguisement, I present it now, Even as it lies before the eye of God, Bare and exposed, convicted and condemn'd. One eve, as in the bowers which overhang The glen where Tagus rolls between his rocks I roam'd alone, alone I met the King. His countenance was troubled, and his speech Like that of one whose tongue to light discourse At fits constrain'd, betrays a heart disturb'd: I too, albeit unconscious of his thoughts, With anxious looks reveal'd what wandering words In vain essay'd to hide. A little while Did this oppressive intercourse endure, Till our eyes met in silence, each to each Telling their mutual tale, then consciously Together fell abash'd. He took my hand And said, Florinda, would that thou and I Earlier had met! oh what a blissful lot Had then been mine, who might have found in thee The sweet companion and the friend endear'd, A fruitful wife and crown of earthly joys! Thou too shouldst then have been of womankind Happiest, as now the loveliest... And with that, First giving way to passion first disclosed, He press'd upon my lips a guilty kiss, .. Alas! more guiltily received than given. Passive and yielding, and yet self-reproach'd, Trembling I stood, upheld in his embrace; When coming steps were heard, and Roderick said, Meet me to-morrow, I beseech thee, here, Queen of my heart! Oh meet me here again, My own Florinda, meet me here again! .. Tongue, eye, and pressure of the impassion'd hand Solicited and urged the ardent suit, And from my hesitating hurried lips The word of promise fatally was drawn. O Roderick, Roderick! hadst thou told me all Thy purpose at that hour, from what a world Of woe had thou and I.... The bitterness Of that reflection overcame her then, And choak'd her speech. But Roderick sate the while Covering his face with both his hands close-prest, His head bow'd down, his spirit to such point Of sufferance knit, as one who patiently Awaits the uplifted sword. Till now, said she, Resuming her confession, I had lived, If not in innocence, yet self-deceived, And of my perilous and sinful state Unconscious. But this fatal hour reveal'd To my awakening soul her guilt and shame; And in those agonies with which remorse, Wrestling with weakness and with cherish'd sin, Doth triumph o'er the lacerated heart, That night.. that miserable night.. I vow'd, A virgin dedicate, to pass my life Immured; and, like redeemëd Magdalen, Or that Egyptian penitent, whose tears Fretted the rock, and moisten'd round her cave The thirsty desert, so to mourn my fall. The struggle ending thus, the victory Thus, as I thought, accomplish'd, I believed My soul was calm, and that the peace of Heave Descended to accept and bless my vow; And in this faith, prepared to consummate The sacrifice, I went to meet the King. See, Father, what a snare had Satan laid! For Roderick came to tell me that the Church From his unfruitful bed would set him free, And I should be his Queen. O let me close The dreadful tale! I told him of my vow; And from sincere and scrupulous piety, But more, I fear me, in that desperate mood Of obstinate will perverse, the which, with pride And shame and self-reproach, doth sometimes make A woman's tongue, her own worst enemy, Run counter to her dearest heart's desire, .. In that unhappy mood did I resist All his most earnest prayers to let the power Of holy Church, never more rightfully Invoked, he said, than now in our behalf, Release us from our fatal bonds. He urged With kindling warmth his suit, like one whose life Hung on the issue; I dissembled not My cruel self-reproaches, nor my grief, Yet desperately maintain'd the rash resolve; Till in the passionate argument he grew Incensed, inflamed, and madden'd or possess'd, .. For Hell too surely at that hour prevail'd, And with such subtile toils enveloped him, That even in the extremity of guilt No guilt he purported, but rather meant An amplest recompence of life-long love For transitory wrong, which fate perverse, Thus madly he deceived himself, compell'd, And therefore stern necessity excused. Here then, O Father, at thy feet I own Myself the guiltier; for full well I knew These were his thoughts, but vengeance master'd me, And in my agony I cursed the man Whom I loved best. Dost thou recall that curse? Cried Roderick, in a deep and inward voice, Still with his head depress'd, and covering still His countenance. Recall it? she exclaim'd; Father, I come to thee because I gave The reins to wrath too long, . . because I wrought His ruin, death, and infamy... O God, Forgive the wicked vengeance thus indulged, As I forgive the King! ... But teach me thou What reparation more than tears and prayers May now be made; . . how shall I vindicate His injured name, and take upon myself..... Daughter of Julian, firmly he replied, Speak not of that, I charge thee! On his fame The Ethiop dye, fixed ineffaceably, For ever will abide; so it must be, So should be: 'tis his rightful punishment; And if to the full measure of his sin The punishment hath fallen, the more our hope That through the blood of Jesus he may find That sin forgiven him. Pausing then, he raised His hand, and pointed where Siverian lay Stretch'd on the heath. To that old man, said he, And to the mother of the unhappy Goth, Tell, if it please thee, . . not what thou hast pour'd Into my secret ear, but that the child For whom they mourn with anguish unallay'd, Sinn'd not from vicious will, or heart corrupt, But fell by fatal circumstance betray'd. And if in charity to them thou sayest Something to palliate, something to excuse An act of sudden frenzy when the Fiend O'ercame him, thou wilt do for Roderick All he could ask thee, all that can be done On earth, and all his spirit could endure. Venturing towards her an imploring look, Wilt thou join with me for his soul in prayer? He said, and trembled as he spake. That voice Of sympathy was like Heaven's influence, Wounding at once and comforting the soul. O Father, Christ requite thee! she exclaim'd; Thou hast set free the springs which withering griefs Have closed too long. Forgive me, for I thought Thou wert a rigid and unpitying judge; One whose stern virtue, fceling in itself No flaw of frailty, heard impatiently Of weakness and of guilt. I wrong'd thee Father! .. With that she took his hand, and kissing it, Bathed it with tears. Then in a firmer speech, For Roderick, for Count Julian and myself, Three wretchedest of all the human race, Who have destroyed each other and ourselves, Mutually wrong'd and wronging, let us pray! XI. COUNT PEDRO'S CASTLE. Twelve weary days with unremitting speed, Shunning frequented tracks, the travellers Pursued their way; the mountain path they chose, The forest or the lonely heath wide-spread, Where cistus shrubs sole-seen exhaled at noon Their fine balsamic odour all around; Strew'd with their blossoms, frail as beautiful, The thirsty soil at eve; and when the sun Relumed the gladden'd earth, opening anew Their stores exuberant, prodigal as frail, Whiten'd again the wilderness. They left The dark Sierra's skirts behind, and cross'd The wilds where Ana in her native hills Collects her sister springs, and hurries on Her course melodious amid loveliest glens, With forest and with fruitage overbower'd. These scenes profusely blest by Heaven they left, Where o'er the hazel and the quince the vine Wide-mantling spreads; and clinging round the cork And ilex, hangs amid their dusky leaves Garlands of brightest hue, with reddening fruit Pendant, or clusters cool of glassy green. So holding on o'er mountain and o'er vale, Tagus they cross'd where midland on his way The King of Rivers rolls his stately stream; And rude Alverches wide and stony bed, And Duero distant far, and many a stream And many a field obscure, in future war For bloody theatre of famous deeds Foredoom'd; and deserts where in years to come Shall populous towns arise, and crested towers And stately temples rear their heads on high. Cautious with course circuitous they shunn'd The embattled city, which in eldest time Thrice-greatest Hermes built, so fables say, Now subjugate, but fated to behold Ere long the heroic Prince (who passing now Unknown and silently the dangerous track, Turns thither his regardant eye) come down Victorious from the heights, and bear abroad Her banner'd Lion, symbol to the Moor Of rout and death through many an age of blood. Lo, there the Asturian hills! Far in the west, Huge Rabanal and Foncebadon huge, Pre-eminent, their giant bulk display, Darkening with earliest shade the distant vales Of Leon, and with evening premature. Far in Cantabria eastward, the long line Extends beyond the reach of eagle's eye, When buoyant in mid-heaven the bird of Jove Soars at his loftiest pitch. In the north, before The travellers the Erbasian mountains rise, Bounding the land beloved, their native land How then, Alphonso, did thy eager soul Chide the slow hours and painful way, which seem'd Lengthening to grow beforc their lagging pace! Youth of heroic thought and high desire, 'Tis not the spur of lofty enterprize That with unequal throbbing hurries now The unquiet heart, now makes it sink dismay'd; 'Tis not impatient joy which thus disturbs In that young breast the healthful spring of life; Joy and ambition have forsaken him, His soul is sick with hope. So near his home, So near his mother's arms; . . alas! perchance The long'd-for meeting may be yet far off As earth from heaven. Sorrow in these long months Of separation may have laid her low; Or what if at his flight the bloody Moor Hath sent his ministers of slaughter forth, And he himself should thus have brought the sword Upon his father's head? . . Sure Hoya too The same dark presage feels, the fearful boy Said in himself; or wherefore is his brow Thus overcast with heaviness, and why Looks he thus anxiously in silence round? Just then that faithful servant raised his hand, And turning to Alphonso with a smile, He pointed where Count Pedro's towers far off Peer'd in the dell below; faint was the smile, And while it sate upon his lips, his eye Retain'd its troubled speculation still. For long had he look'd wistfully in vain, Seeking where far or near he might espy From whom to learn if time or chance had wrought Change in his master's house: but on the hills Nor goat-herd could he see, nor traveller, Nor huntsman early at his sports afield, Nor angler following up the mountain glen His lonely pastime; neither could he hear Carol, or pipe, or shout of shepherd's boy, Nor woodman's axe, for not a human sound Disturb'd the silence of the solitude. Is it the spoiler's work? At yonder door Behold the favourite kidling bleats unheard; The next stands open, and the sparrows there Boldly pass in and out. Thither he turn'd To seek what indications were within; The chesnut-bread was on the shelf, the churn, As if in haste forsaken, full and fresh; The recent fire had moulder'd on the hearth; And broken cobwebs mark'd the whiter space Where from the wall the buckler and the sword Had late been taken down. Wonder at first Had mitigated fear, but Hoya now Return'd to tell the symbols of good hope, And they prick'd forward joyfully. Ere long Perceptible above the ceaseless sound Of yonder stream, a voice of multitudes, As if in loud acclaim, was heard far off; And nearer as they drew, distincter shouts Came from the dell, and at Count Pedro's gate The human swarm were seen, . . a motley group, Maids, mothers, helpless infancy, weak age, And wondering children and tumultuous boys, Hot youth and resolute manhood gather'd there, In uproar all. Anon the moving mass Falls in half circle back, a general cry Bursts forth, exultant arms are lifted up, And caps are thrown aloft, as through the gate Count Pedro's banner came. Alphonso shriek'd For joy, and smote his steed and gallop'd on. Fronting the gate the standard-bearer holds His precious charge. Behind the men divide In order'd files; green boyhood presses there, And waning eld, pleading a youthful soul, Intreats admission. All is ardour here, Hope and brave purposes and minds resolved. Nor where the weaker sex is left apart Doth aught of fear find utterance, though perchance Some paler cheeks might there be seen, some eyes Big with sad bodings, and some natural tears. Count Pedro's war-horse in the vacant space Strikes with impatient hoof the trodden turf, And gazing round upon the martial show, Proud of his stately trappings, flings his head, And snorts and champs the bit, and neighing shrill Wakes the near echo with his voice of joy. The page beside him holds his master's spear And shield and helmet. In the castle-gate Count Pedro stands, his countenance resolved But mournful, for Favinia on his arm Hung, passionate with her fears, and held him back. Go not, she cried, with this deluded crew! She hath not, Pedro, with her frantic words Bereft thy faculty, . . she is crazed with grief, And her delirium hath infected these: But, Pedro, thou art calm; thou dost not share The madness of the crowd; thy sober mind Surveys the danger in its whole extent, And sees the certain ruin, . . for thou know'st I know thou hast no hope. Unhappy man, Why then for this most desperate enterprize Wilt thou devote thy son, thine only child? Not for myself I plead, nor even for thee; Thou art a soldier, and thou canst not fear The face of death; and I should welcome it As the best visitant whom Heaven could send. Not for our lives I speak then, . . were they worth The thought of preservation; . . Nature soon Must call for them; the sword that should cut short Sorrow's slow work were merciful to us. But spare Alphonso! there is time and hope In store for him. O thou who gavest him life, Seal not his death, his death and mine at once! Peace! he replied: thou know'st there is no choice, I did not raise the storm; I cannot turn Its course aside! but where yon banner goes Thy Lord must not be absent! Spare me then, Favinia, lest I hear thy honour'd name Now first attainted with deserved reproach. The boy is in God's hands. He who of yore Walk'd with the sons of Judah in the fire, And from the lion's den drew Daniel forth Unhurt, can save him, . . if it be his will. Even as he spake, the astonish'd troop set up A shout of joy which rung through all the hills. Alphonso heeds not how they break their ranks And gather round to greet him; from his horse Precipitate and panting off he springs. Pedro grew pale, and trembled at his sight; Favinia claspt her hands, and looking up To Heaven as she embraced the boy, exclaim'd, Lord God, forgive me for my sinful fears; Unworthy that I am, . . my son, my son! XII. THE VOW. Always I knew thee for a generous foe, Pelayo! said the Count; and in our time Of enmity, thou too, I know, didst feel The feud between us was but of the house, Not of the heart. Brethren in arms henceforth We stand or fall together: nor will I Look to the event with one misgiving thought, .. That were to prove myself unworthy now Of Heaven's benignant providence, this hour, Scarcely by less than miracle, vouchsafed. I will believe that we have days in store Of hope, now risen again as from the dead, .. Of vengeance, . . of portentous victory, .. Yea, maugre all unlikelihoods, . . of peace. Let us then here indissolubly knit Our ancient houses, that those happy days, When they arrive, may find us more than friends, And bound by closer than fraternal ties. Thou hast a daughter, Prince, to whom my heart Yearns now, as if in winning infancy Her smiles had been its daily food of love. I need not tell thee what Alphonso is, .. Thou know'st the boy! Already had that hope, Replied Pelayo, risen within my soul. O Thou, who in thy mercy from the house Of Moorish bondage hast deliver'd us, Fulfil the pious purposes for which Here, in thy presence, thus we pledge our hands! Strange hour to plight espousals! yielding half To superstitious thoughts, Favinia cried, And these strange witnesses! . . The times are strange, With thoughtful speech composed her Lord replies, And what thou seest accords with them. This day Is wonderful; nor could auspicious Heaven With fairer or with fitter omen gild Our enterprize, when strong in heart and hope We take the field, preparing thus for works Of piety and love. Unwillingly I yielded to my people's general voice, Thinking that she who with her powerful words To this excess had roused and kindled them, Spake from the spirit of her griefs alone, Not with prophetic impulse. Be that sin Forgiven me! and the calm and quiet faith Which, in the place of incredulity, Hath fill'd me, now that seeing I believe, Doth give of happy end to righteous cause A presage, not presumptuous, but assured. Then Pedro told Pelayo how from vale To vale the exalted Adosinda went, Exciting sire and son, in holy war Conquering or dying, to secure their place In Paradise: and how reluctantly, And mourning for his child by his own act Thus doom'd to death, he bade with heavy heart His banner be brought forth. Devoid alike Of purpose and of hope himself, he meant To march toward the western Mountaineers, Where Odoar by his counsel might direct Their force conjoin'd. Now, said he, we must haste To Cangas, there, Pelayo, to secure, With timely speed, I trust in God, thy house. Then looking to his men, he cried, Bring forth The armour which in Wamba's wars I wore... Alphonso's heart leapt at the auspicious words. Count Pedro mark'd the rising glow of joy, .. Doubly to thee, Alphonso, he pursued, This day above all other days is blest, From whence as from a birth-day thou wilt date Thy life in arms! Rejoicing in their task, The servants of the house with emulous love Dispute the charge. One brings the cuirass, one The buckler; this exultingly displays The sword, his comrade lifts the helm on high: The greaves, the gauntlets they divide; a spur Seems now to dignify the officious hand Which for such service bears it to his Lord. Greek artists in the imperial city forged That splendid armour, perfect in their craft; With curious skill they wrought it, framed alike To shine amid the pageantry of war, And for the proof of battle. Many a time Alphonso from his nurse's lap had stretch'd His infant hands toward it eagerly, Where gleaming to the central fire it hung High in the hall; and many a time had wish'd With boyish ardour, that the day were come When Pedro to his prayers would grant the boon, His dearest heart's desire. Count Pedro then Would smile, and in his heart rejoice to see The noble instinct manifest itself. Then too Favinia with maternal pride Would turn her eyes exulting to her Lord, And in that silent language bid him mark His spirit in his boy; all danger then Was distant, and if secret forethought faint Of manhood's perils, and the chance of war, Hateful to mothers, pass'd across her mind, The ill remote gave to the present hour A heighten'd feeling of secure delight. No season this for old solemnities, For wassailry and sport; . . the bath, the bed, The vigil, . . all preparatory rites Omitted now, . . here in the face of Heaven, Before the vassals of his father's house, With them in instant peril to partake The chance of life or death, the heroic boy Dons his first arms; the coated scales of steel Which o'er the tunic to his knees depend, The hose, the sleeves of mail; bareheaded then He stood. But when Count Pedro took the spurs And bent his knee in service to his son, Alphonso from that gesture half drew back, Starting in reverence, and a deeper hue Spread o'er the glow of joy which flush'd his cheeks. Do thou the rest, Pelayo! said the Count; So shall the ceremony of this hour Exceed in honour what in form it lacks. The Prince from Hoya's faithful hand receiv'd The sword; he girt it round the youth, and drew And placed it in his hand; unsheathing then His own good falchion, with its burnish'd blade He touch'd Alphonso's neck, and with a kiss Gave him his rank in arms. Thus long the crowd Had look'd intently on, in silence hush'd; Loud and continuous now with one accord, Shout following shout, their acclamations rose; Blessings were breathed from every heart, and joy, Powerful alike in all, which as with force Of an inebriating cup inspired The youthful, from the eye of age drew tears. The uproar died away, when standing forth, Roderick with lifted hand besought a pause For speech, and moved towards the youth. I too, Young Baron, he began, must do my part; Not with prerogative of earthly power, But as the servant of the living God, The God of Hosts. This day thou promisest To die when honour calls thee for thy faith, For thy liege Lord, and for thy native land; The duties which at birth we all contract, Are by the high profession of this hour Made thine especially. Thy noble blood, The thoughts with which thy childhood hath been fed, And thine own noble nature more than all, Are sureties for thee. But these dreadful times Demand a farther pledge; for it hath pleased The Highest, as he tried his Saints of old, So in the fiery furnace of his wrath To prove and purify the sons of Spain; And they must knit their spirits to the proof, Or sink, for ever lost. Hold forth thy sword, Young Baron, and before thy people take The vow which, in Toledo's sacred name, Poor as these weeds bespeak me, I am here To minister with delegated power. With reverential awe was Roderick heard By all, so well authority became That mien and voice and countenance austere. Pelayo with complacent eye beheld The unlook'd-for interposal, and the Count Bends toward Alphonso his approving head. The youth obedient loosen'd from his belt The sword, and looking, while his heart beat fast, To Roderick, reverently expectant stood. O noble youth, the Royal Goth pursued, Thy country is in bonds; an impious foe Oppresses her; he brings with him strange laws, Strange language, evil customs, and false faith, And forces them on Spain. Swear that thy soul Will make no covenant with these accursed, But that the sword shall be from this day forth Thy children's portion, to be handed down From sire to son, a sacred heritage, Through every generation, till the work Be done, and this insulted land hath drunk In sacrifice, the last invader's blood! Bear witness, ancient Mountains! cried the youth, And ye, my native Streams, who hold your course For ever; . . this dear Earth, and yonder Sky, Be witness! for myself I make the vow, And for my children's children. Here I stand Their sponsor, binding them in sight of Heaven, As by a new baptismal sacrament, To wage hereditary holy war, Perpetual, patient, persevering war, Till not one living enemy pollute The sacred soil of Spain. So as he ceased, While yet toward the clear blue firmament His eyes were raised, he lifted to his lips The sword, with reverent gesture bending then Devoutly kiss'd its cross. And ye! exclaimed Roderick, as turning to the assembled troop He motion'd with authoritative hand, .. Ye children of the hills and sons of Spain! Through every heart the rapid feeling ran, .. For us! they answer'd all with one accord, And at the word they knelt: People and Prince, The young and old, the father and the son, At once they knelt; with one accord they cried, For us, and for our seed! with one accord They cross'd their fervent arms, and with bent head Inclined toward that aweful voice from whence The inspiring impulse came. The Royal Goth Made answer, I receive your vow for Spain And for the Lord of Hosts: your cause is good, Go forward in his spirit and his strength. Ne'er in his happiest hours had Roderick With such commanding majesty dispensed His princely gifts, as dignified him now, When with slow movement, solemnly upraised, Toward the kneeling troop he spread his arms, As if the expanded soul diffused itself, And carried to all spirits with the act Its effluent inspiration. Silently The people knelt, and when they rose, such awe Held them in silence, that the eagle's cry, Who far above them, at her highest flight A speck scarce visible, gyred round and round, Was heard distinctly; and the mountain stream, Which from the distant glen sent forth its sounds Wafted upon the wind, grew audible In that deep hush of feeling, like the voice Of waters in the stillness of the night. XIII. COUNT EUDON. That aweful silence still endured, when one, Who to the northern entrance of the vale Had turn'd his casual eye, exclaim'd, The Moors! .. For from the forest verge a troop were seen Hastening toward Pedro's hall. Their forward speed Was check'd when they beheld his banner spread, And saw his order'd spears in prompt array Marshall'd to meet their coming. But the pride Of power and insolence of long command Prick'd on their Chief presumptuous: We are come Late for prevention, cried the haughty Moor, But never time more fit for punishment! These unbelieving slaves must feel and know Their master's arm! . . On, faithful Musselmen, On.. on, . . and hew down the rebellious dogs! .. Then as he spurr'd his steed, Allah is great! Mahommed is his Prophet! he exclaim'd, And led the charge. Count Pedro met the Chief In full career; he bore him from his horse A full spear's length upon the lance transfix'd; Then leaving in his breast the mortal shaft, Pass'd on, and breaking through the turban'd files Open'd a path. Pelayo, who that day Fought in the ranks afoot, for other war Yet unequipp'd, pursued and smote the foe, But ever on Alphonso at his side Retain'd a watchful eye. The gallant boy Gave his good sword that hour its earliest taste Of Moorish blood, . . that sword whose hungry edge, Through the fair course of all his glorious life From that auspicious day, was fed so well. Cheap was the victory now for Spain achieved; For the first fervour of their zeal inspired The Mountaineers, . . the presence of their Chiefs, The sight of all dear objects, all dear ties, The air they breathed, the soil whereon they trod, Duty, devotion, faith, and hope and joy. And little had the misbelievers ween'd In such impetuous onset to receive A greeting deadly as their own intent; Victims they thought to find, not men prepared And eager for the fight; their confidence Therefore gave way to wonder, and dismay Effected what astonishment began. Scatter'd before the impetuous Mountaineers, Buckler and spear and scymitar they dropt, As in precipitate route they fled before The Asturian sword: the vales and hills and rocks Received their blood, and where they fell the wolves At evening found them. From the fight apart Two Africans had stood, who held in charge Count Eudon. When they saw their countrymen Falter, give way, and fly before the foe, One turn'd toward him with malignant rage, And saying, Infidel! thou shalt not live To join their triumph! aim'd against his neck The moony falchion's point. His comrade raised A hasty hand and turn'd its edge aside, Yet so that o'er the shoulder glancing down It scarr'd him as it pass'd. The murderous Moor, Not tarrying to secure his vengeance, fled; While he of milder mood, at Eudon's feet Fell and embraced his knees. The mountaineer Who found them thus, withheld at Eudon's voice His wrathful hand, and led them to his Lord. Count Pedro and Alphonso and the Prince Stood on a little rocky eminence Which overlook'd the vale. Pedro had put His helmet off, and with sonorous horn Blew the recall; for well he knew what thoughts, Calm as the Prince appear'd and undisturb'd, Lay underneath his silent fortitude; And how at this eventful juncture speed Imported more than vengeance. Thrice he sent The long-resounding signal forth, which rung From hill to hill, re-echoing far and wide. Slow and unwillingly his men obey'd The swelling horn's reiterated call; Repining that a single foe escaped The retribution of that righteous hour. With lingering step reluctant from the chase They turn'd, . . their veins full-swoln, their sinews strung For battle still, their hearts unsatisfied; Their swords were dropping still with Moorish blood, And where they wiped their reeking brows, the stain Of Moorish gore was left. But when they came Where Pedro, with Alphonso at his side, Stood to behold their coming, then they press'd All emulous, with gratulation round, Extolling for his deeds that day display'd The noble boy. Oh! when had Heaven, they said, With such especial favour manifest Illustrated a first essay in arms! They bless'd the father from whose loins he sprung, The mother at whose happy breast he fed; And pray'd that their young hero's fields might be Many, and all like this. Thus they indulged The honest heart, exuberant of love, When that loquacious joy at once was check'd, For Eudon and the Moor were brought before Count Pedro. Both came fearfully and pale, But with a different fear: the African Felt at this crisis of his destiny Such apprehension as without reproach Might blanch a soldier's cheek, when life and death Hang on another's will, and helplessly He must abide the issue. But the thoughts Which quail'd Count Eudon's heart, and made hislimbs Quiver, were of his own unworthiness, Old enmity, and that he stood in power Of hated and hereditary foes. I came not with them willingly! he cried, Addressing Pedro and the Prince at once, Rolling from each to each his restless eyes Aghast, . . the Moor can tell I had no choice; They forced me from my castle: . . in the fight They would have slain me: . . see I bleed! The Moor Can witness that a Moorish scymitar Inflicted this: . . he saved me from worse hurt: .. I did not come in arms: . . he knows it all; .. Speak, man, and let the truth be known to clear My innocence! Thus as he ceased, with fear And rapid utterance panting open-mouth'd, Count Pedro half represt a mournful smile, Wherein compassion seem'd to mitigate His deep contempt. Methinks, said he, the Moor Might with more reason look himself to find An intercessor, than be call'd upon To play the pleader's part. Didst thou then save The Baron from thy comrades? Let my Lord Show mercy to me, said the Musselman, As I am free from falsehood. We were left, I and another, holding him in charge; My fellow would have slain him when he saw How the fight fared: I turn'd the scymitar Aside, and trust that life will be the meed For life by me preserved. Nor shall thy trust, Rejoin'd the Count, be vain. Say farther now, From whence ye came? . . your orders what? . . what force In Gegio? and if others like yourselves Are in the field? The African replied, We came from Gegio, order'd to secure This Baron on the way, and seek thee here To bear thee hence in bonds. A messenger From Cordoba, whose speed denoted well He came with urgent tidings, was the cause Of this our sudden movement. We went forth Three hundred men; an equal force was sent For Cangas, on like errand as I ween. Four hundred in the city then were left. If other force be moving from the south, I know not, save that all appearances Denote alarm and vigilance. The Prince Fix'd upon Eudon then his eye severe; Baron, he said, the die of war is cast; What part art thou prepared to take? against, Or with the oppressor? Not against my friends, .. Not against you! . . the irresolute wretch replied, Hasty, yet faltering in his fearful speech: But.. have ye weigh'd it well? . . It is not yet Too late, . . their numbers, . . their victorious force, Which hath already trodden in the dust The sceptre of the Goths: . . the throne destroy'd, . Our towns subdued, . . our country overrun, .. The people to the yoke of their new Lords Resign'd in peace... Can I not mediate? .. Were it not better through my agency To gain such terms, . . such honourable terms.... Terms! cried Pelayo, cutting short at once That dastard speech, and checking, ere it grew Too powerful for restraint, the incipient wrath Which in indignant murmurs breathing round, Rose like a gathering storm, learn thou what terms Asturias, this day speaking by my voice, Doth constitute to be the law between Thee and thy Country. Our portentous age, As with an earthquake's desolating force, Hath loosen'd and disjointed the whole frame Of social order, and she calls not now For service with the force of sovereign will. That which was common duty in old times, Becomes an arduous, glorious virtue now; And every one, as between Hell and Heaven, In free election must be left to chuse. Asturias asks not of thee to partake The cup which we have pledged; she claims from none The dauntless fortitude, the mind resolved, Which only God can give; . . therefore such peace As thou canst find where all around is war, She leaves thee to enjoy. But think not, Count, That because thou art weak, one valiant arm, One generous spirit must be lost to Spain! The vassal owes no service to the Lord Who to his Country doth acknowledge none. The summons which thou hast not heart to give, I and Count Pedro over thy domains Will send abroad; the vassals who were thine Will fight beneath our banners, and our wants Shall from thy lands, as from a patrimony Which hath reverted to the common stock, Be fed: such tribute, too, as to the Moors Thou renderest, we will take: It is the price Which in this land for weakness must be paid While evil stars prevail. And mark me, Chief! Fear is a treacherous counsellor! I know Thou thinkëst that beneath his horses's hoofs The Moor will trample our poor numbers down; But join not, in contempt of us and Heaven, His multitudes! for if thou shouldst be found Against thy country, on the readiest tree Those recreant bones shall rattle in the wind, When the birds have left them bare. As thus he spake, Count Eudon heard and trembled: every joint Was loosen'd, every fibre of his flesh Thrill'd, and from every pore effused, cold sweat Clung on his quivering limbs. Shame forced it forth, Envy, and inward consciousness, and fear Predominant, which stifled in his heart Hatred and rage. Before his livid lips Could shape to utterance their essay'd reply, Compassionately Pedro interposed. Go, Baron, to the Castle, said the Count; There let thy wound be look'd to, and consult Thy better mind at leisure. Let this Moor Attend upon thee there, and when thou wilt, Follow thy fortunes..... To Pelayo then He turn'd, and saying, All-too-long, O Prince, Hath this unlook'd-for conflict held thee here, .. He bade his gallant men begin their march. Flush'd with success, and in auspicious hour, The Mountaineers set forth. Blessings and prayers Pursued them at their parting, and the tears Which fell were tears of fervour, not of grief. The sun was verging to the western slope Of Heaven, but they till midnight travell'd on; Renewing then at early dawn their way, They held their unremitting course from morn Till latest eve, such urgent cause impell'd; And night had closed around, when to the vale Where Sella in her ampler bed receives Pionia's stream they came. Massive and black Pelayo's castle there was seen; its lines And battlements against the deep blue sky Distinct in solid darkness visible. No light is in the tower. Eager to know The worst, and with that fatal certainty To terminate intolerable dread, He spurr'd his courser forward. All his fears Too surely are fulfill'd, . . for open stand The doors, and mournfully at times a dog Fills with his howling the deserted hall. A moment overcome with wretchedness, Silent Pelayo stood! recovering then, Lord God, resign'd he cried, thy will be done! XIV. THE RESCUE. Count, said Pelayo, Nature hath assign'd Two sovereign remedies for human grief; Religion, surest, firmest, first and best, Strength to the weak and to the wounded balm; And strenuous action next. Think not I came With unprovided heart. My noble wife, In the last solemn words, the last farewell With which she charged her secret messenger, Told me that whatsoe'er was my resolve, She bore a mind prepared. And well I know The evil, be it what it may, hath found In her a courage equal to the hour. Captivity, or death, or what worse pangs, She in her children may be doom'd to feel, Will never make that steady soul repent Its virtuous purpose. I too did not cast My single life into the lot, but knew These dearer pledges on the die were set; And if the worst have fallen, I shall but bear That in my breast, which, with transfiguring power Of piety, makes chastening sorrow take The form of hope, and sees, in Death, the friend And the restoring Angel. We must rest Perforce, and wait what tidings night may bring, Haply of comfort. Ho there! kindle fires, And see if aught of hospitality Can yet within these mournful walls be found! Thus while he spake, lights were descried far off Moving among the trees, and coming sounds Were heard as of a distant multitude. Anon a company of horse and foot, Advancing in disorderly array, Came up the vale; before them and beside Their torches flash'd on Sella's rippling stream; Now gleam'd through chesnut groves, emerging now, O'er their huge boughs and radiated leaves Cast broad and bright a transitory glare. That sight inspired with strength the mountaineers; All sense of weariness, all wish for rest At once were gone; impatient in desire Of second victory alert they stood; And when the hostile symbols, which from far Imagination to their wish had shaped, Vanish'd in nearer vision, high-wrought hope Departing, left the spirit pall'd and blank. No turban'd race, no sons of Africa Were they who now came winding up the vale, As waving wide before their horses' feet The torch-light floated, with its hovering glare Blackening the incumbent and surrounding night. Helmet and breast-plate glitter'd as they came, And spears erect; and nearer as they drew Were the loose folds of female garments seen On those who led the company. Who then Had stood beside Pelayo, might have heard The beating of his heart. But vainly there Sought he with wistful eye the well-known forms Beloved; and plainly might it now be seen That from some bloody conflict they return'd Victorious, . . for at every saddle-bow A gorey head was hung. Anon they stopt, Levelling in quick alarm their ready spears. Hold! who goes there? cried one. A hundred tongues Sent forth with one accord the glad reply, Friends and Asturians. Onward moved the lights, .. The people knew their Lord. Then what a shout Rung through the valley! From their clay-builtnests, Beneath the overbrowing battlements, Now first disturb'd, the affrighted martins flew, And uttering notes of terror short and shrill, Amid the yellow glare and lurid smoke Wheel'd giddily. Then plainly was it shown How well the vassals loved their generous Lord, How like a father the Asturian Prince Was dear. They crowded round; they claspt his knees; They snatch'd his hand; they fell upon his neck, .. They wept; . . they blest Almighty Providence, Which had restored him thus from bondage free; God was with them and their good cause, they said; His hand was here... His shield was over them, .. His spirit was abroad, . . His power display'd: And pointing to their bloody trophies then, They told Pelayo there he might behold The first-fruits of the harvest they should soon Reap in the field of war! Benignantly, With voice and look and gesture, did the Prince To these warm greetings of tumultuous joy Respond; and sure if at that moment aught Could for awhile have overpower'd those fears Which from the inmost heart o'er all his frame Diffused their chilling influence, worthy pride, And sympathy of love and joy and hope, Had then possess'd him wholly. Even now His spirit rose; the sense of power, the sight Of his brave people, ready where he led To fight their country's battles, and the thought Of instant action, and deliverance, .. If Heaven, which thus far had protected him, Should favour still, . . revived his heart, and gave Fresh impulse to its spring. In vain he sought Amid that turbulent greeting to enquire Where Gaudiosa was, his children where, Who call'd them to the field, who captain'd them; And how these women, thus with arms and death Environ'd, came amid their company? For yet, amid the fluctuating light And tumult of the crowd, he knew them not. Guisla was one. The Moors had found in her A willing and concerted prisoner. Gladly to Gegio, to the renegade On whom her loose and shameless love was bent, Had she set forth; and in her heart she cursed The busy spirit, who, with powerful call Rousing Pelayo's people, led them on In quick pursual, and victoriously Achieved the rescue, to her mind perverse Unwelcome as unlook'd for. With dismay She recognized her brother, dreaded now More than he once was dear; her countenance Was turn'd toward him, . . not with eager joy To court his sight, and meeting its first glance, Exchange delightful welcome, soul with soul; Hers was the conscious eye, that cannot chuse But look to what it fears. She could not shun His presence, and the rigid smile constrain'd, With which she coldly drest her features, ill Conceal'd her inward thoughts, and the despite Of obstinate guilt and unrepentant shame. Sullenly thus upon her mule she sate, Waiting the greeting which she did not dare Bring on. But who is she that at her side, Upon a stately war-horse eminent, Holds the loose rein with careless hand? A helm Presses the clusters of her flaxen hair; The shield is on her arm; her breast is mail'd; A sword-belt is her girdle, and right well It may be seen that sword hath done its work To-day, for upward from the wrist her sleeve Is stiff with blood. An unregardant eye, As one whose thoughts were not of earth, she cast Upon the turmoil round. One countenance So strongly mark'd, so passion-worn was there, That it recall'd her mind. Ha! Maccabee! Lifting her arm, exultingly she cried, Did I not tell thee we should meet in joy? Well, Brother, hast thou done thy part, . . I too Have not been wanting! Now be His the praise, From whom the impulse came! That startling call, That voice so well remember'd, touch'd the Goth With timely impulse now; for he had seen His Mother's face, . . and at her sight, the past And present mingled like a frightful dream, Which from some dread reality derives Its deepest horror. Adosinda's voice Dispersed the waking vision. Little deem'd Rusilla at that moment that the child, For whom her supplications day and night Were offer'd, breathed the living air. Her heart Was calm; her placid countenance, though grief Deeper than time had left its traces there, Retain'd its dignity serene; yet when Siverian, pressing through the people, kiss'd Her reverend hand, some quiet tears ran down. As she approach'd the Prince, the crowd made way Respectful. The maternal smile which bore Her greeting, from Pelayo's heart at once Dispell'd its boding. What he would have ask'd She knew, and bending from her palfrey down, Told him that they for whom he look'd were safe, And that in secret he should hear the rest. XV. RODERICK AT CANGAS. How calmly gliding through the dark-blue sky The midnight Moon ascends! Her placid beams Through thinly scatter'd leaves and boughs grotesque, Mottle with mazy shades the orchard slope; Here, o'er the chesnut's fretted foliage grey And massy, motionless they spread; here shine Upon the crags, deepening with blacker night Their chasms; and there the glittering argentry Ripples and glances on the confluent streams. A lovelier, purer light than that of day Rests on the hills; and oh how awefully Into that deep and tranquil firmament The summits of Auseva rise serene! The watchman on the battlements partakes The stillness of the solemn hour; he feels The silence of the earth, the endless sound Of flowing water soothes him, and the stars, Which in that brightest moon-light well-nigh quench'd Scarce visible, as in the utmost depth Of yonder sapphire infinite, are seen, Draw on with elevating influence Toward eternity the attemper'd mind. Musing on worlds beyond the grave he stands, And to the Virgin Mother silently Prefers her hymn of praise. The mountaineers Before the castle, round their mouldering fires, Lie on the hearth outstretch'd. Pelayo's hall Is full, and he upon his careful couch Hears all around the deep and long-drawn breath Of sleep: for gentle night hath brought to these Perfect and undisturb'd repose, alike Of corporal powers and inward faculty. Wakeful the while he lay, yet more by hope Than grief or anxious thoughts possess'd, . . though grief For Guisla's guilt, which freshen'd in his heart The memory of their wretched mother's crime, Still made its presence felt, like the dull sense Of some perpetual inward malady; And the whole peril of the future lay Before him clearly seen. He had heard all; How that unworthy sister, obstinate In wrong and shameless, rather seem'd to woo The upstart renegado than to wait His wooing; how, as guilt to guilt led on, Spurning at gentle admonition first, When Gaudiosa hopelessly forbore From farther counsel, then in sullen mood Resentful, Guisla soon began to hate The virtuous presence before which she felt Her nature how inferior, and her fault How foul. Despiteful thus she grew, because Humbled yet unrepentant. Who could say To what excess bad passions might impel A woman thus possess'd? She could not fail To mark Siverian's absence, for what end Her conscience but too surely had divined; And Gaudiosa, well aware that all To the vile paramour was thus made known, Had to safe hiding-place with timely fear Removed her children. Well the event had proved How needful was that caution; for at night She sought the mountain solitudes, and morn Beheld Numacian's soldiers at the gate. Yet did not sorrow in Pelayo's heart For this domestic shame prevail that hour, Nor gathering danger weigh his spirit down. The anticipated meeting put to flight These painful thoughts; to-morrow will restore All whom his heart holds dear; his wife beloved, No longer now remember'd for regret, Is present to his soul with hope and joy; His inward eye beholds Favila's form In opening youth robust, and Hermesind, His daughter, lovely as a budding rose; Their images beguile the hours of night, Till with the earliest morning he may seek Their secret hold. The nightingale not yet Had ceased her song, nor had the early lark Her dewy nest forsaken, when the Prince Upward beside Pionia took his way Toward Auseva. Heavily to him, Impatient for the morrow's happiness, Long night had linger'd, but it seem'd more long To Roderick's aching heart. He too had watch'd For dawn, and seen the earliest break of day, And heard its earliest sounds; and when the Prince Went forth, the melancholy man was seen With pensive pace upon Pionia's side Wandering alone and slow. For he had left The wearying place of his unrest, that morn With its cold dews might bathe his throbbing brow, And with its breath allay the feverish heat That burnt within. Alas! the gales of morn Reach not the fever of a wounded heart! How shall he meet his Mother's eye, how make His secret known, and from that voice revered Obtain forgiveness, . . all that he has now To ask, ere on the lap of earth in peace He lay his head resign'd? In silent prayer He supplicated Heaven to strengthen him Against that trying hour, there seeking aid Where all who seek shall find; and thus his soul Received support, and gather'd fortitude, Never than now more needful, for the hour Was nigh. He saw Siverian drawing near, And with a dim but quick foreboding met The good old man; yet when he heard him say, My Lady sends to seek thee, like a knell To one expecting and prepared for death, But fearing the dread point that hastens on, It smote his heart. He follow'd silently, And knit his suffering spirit to the proof. He went resolved to tell his Mother all, Fall at her feet, and drinking the last dregs Of bitterness, receive the only good Earth had in store for him. Resolved for this He went; yet was it a relief to find That painful resolution must await A fitter season, when no eye but Heaven's Might witness to their mutual agony. Count Julian's daughter with Rusilla state; Both had been weeping, both were pale, but calm. With head as for humility abased Roderick approach'd, and bending, on his breast He cross'd his humble arms. Rusilla rose In reverence to the priestly character, And with a mournful eye regarding him, Thus she began. Good Father, I have heard From my old faithful servant and true friend, Thou didst reprove the inconsiderate tongue, That in the anguish of its spirit pour'd A curse upon my poor unhappy child. O Father Maccabee, this is a hard world, And hasty in its judgements! Time has been, When not a tongue within the Pyrenees Dared whisper in dispraise of Roderick's name, Lest, if the conscious air had caught the sound, The vengeance of the honest multitude Should fall upon the traitorous head, or brand For life-long infamy the lying lips. Now if a voice be raised in his behalf, 'Tis noted for a wonder, and the man Who utters the strange speech shall be admired For such excess of Christian charity. Thy Christian charity hath not been lost; .. Father, I feel its virtue: . . it hath been Balm to my heart; . . with words and grateful tears, .. All that is left me now for gratitude, .. I thank thee, and beseech thee in thy prayers That thou wilt still remember Roderick's name. Roderick so long had to this hour look'd on, That when the actual point of trial came, Torpid and numb'd it found him; cold he grew, And as the vital spirits to the heart Retreated, o'er his wither'd countenance, Deathy and damp, a whiter paleness spread. Unmoved the while, the inward feeling seem'd, Even in such dull insensibility As gradual age brings on, or slow disease, Beneath whose progress lingering life survives The power of suffering. Wondering at himself, Yet gathering confidence, he raised his eyes, Then slowly shaking as he bent his head, O venerable Lady, he replied, If aught may comfort that unhappy soul, It must be thy compassion, and thy prayers. She whom he most hath wrong'd, she who alone On earth can grant forgiveness for his crime, She hath forgiven him; and thy blessing now Were all that he could ask, . . all that could bring Profit or consolation to his soul, If he hath been as sure we may believe, A penitent sincere. Oh had he lived, Replied Rusilla, never penitence Had equall'd his! full well I know his heart, Vehement in all things. He would on himself Have wreak'd such penance as had reach'd the height Of fleshly suffering... yea, which being told With its portentuous rigour should have made The memory of his fault, o'erpower'd and lost In shuddering pity and astonishment, Fade like a feebler horror. Otherwise Seem'd good to Heaven. I murmur not, nor doubt The boundless mercy of redeeming love. For sure I trust that not in his offence Harden'd and reprobate was my lost son, A child of wrath, cut off! . . that dreadful thought, Not even amid the first fresh wretchedness, When the ruin burst around me like a flood, Assail'd my soul. I ever deem'd his fall An act of sudden madness; and this day Hath in unlook'd-for confirmation given A livelier hope, a more assurëd faith. Smiling benignant then amid her tears, She took Florinda by the hand, and said, I little thought that I should live to bless Count Julian's daughter! She hath brought to me The last, the best, the only comfort earth Could minister to this afflicted heart, And my grey hairs may now unto the grave Go down in peace. Happy, Florinda cried, Are they for whom the grave hath peace in store! The wrongs they have sustain'd, the woes they bear, Pass not that holy threshold, where Death heals The broken heart. O Lady, thou may'st trust In humble hope, through Him who on the Cross Gave his atoning blood for lost mankind, To meet beyond the grave thy child forgiven. I too with Roderick there may interchange Forgiveness. But the grief which wastes away This mortal frame, hastening the happy hour Of my enlargement, is but a light part Of what my soul endures! . . that grief hath lost Its sting: . . I have a keener sorrow here, .. One which, . . but God forefend that dire event, .. May pass with me the portals of the grave, And with a thought, like sin which cannot die, Embitter Heaven. My father hath renounced His hope in Christ! It was his love for me Which drove him to perdition... I was born To ruin all who loved me, . . all I loved! Perhaps I sinn'd in leaving him; . . that fear Rises within me to disturb the peace Which I should else have found. To Roderick then The pious mourner turn'd her suppliant eyes: O Father, there is virtue in thy prayers! .. I do beseech thee offer them to Heaven In his behalf! For Roderick's sake, for mine, Wrestle with Him whose name is Merciful, That Julian may with penitence be touch'd, And clinging to the Cross, implore that grace Which ne'er was sought in vain. For Roderick's sake And mine, pray for him! We have been the cause Of his offence! What other miseries May from that same unhappy source have risen, Are earthly, temporal, reparable all; .. But if a soul be lost through our misdeeds, That were eternal evil! Pray for him, Good Father Maccabee, and be thy prayers More fervent, as the deeper is the crime. While thus Florinda spake, the dog who lay Before Rusilla's feet, eyeing him long And wistfully, had recognised at length, Changed as he was and in those sordid weeds, His royal master. And he rose and lick'd His wither'd hand, and earnestly look'd up With eyes whose human meaning did not need The aid of speech; and moan'd, as if at once To court and chide the long-withheld caress. A feeling uncommix'd with sense of guilt Or shame, yet painfulest, thrill'd through the King; But he to self-controul now long inured, Represt his rising heart, nor other tears, Full as his struggling bosom was, let fall Than seem'd to follow on Florinda's words. Looking toward her then, yet so that still He shunn'd the meeting of her eye, he said, Virtuous and pious as thou art, and ripe For Heaven, O Lady, I must think the man Hath not by his good Angel been cast off For whom thy supplications rise. The Lord Whose justice doth in its unerring course Visit the children for the sire's offence, Shall He not in his boundless mercy hear The daughter's prayer, and for her sake restore The guilty parent? My soul shall with thine In earnest and continual duty join... How deeply, how devoutly, He will know To whom the cry is raised! Thus having said, Deliberately, in self-possession still, Himself from that most painful interview Dispeeding, he withdrew. The watchful dog Follow'd his footsteps close. But he retired Into the thickest grove; there yielding way To his o'erburthen'd nature, from all eyes Apart, he cast himself upon the ground, And threw his arms around the dog, and cried, While tears stream'd down, Thou, Theron, then hast known Thy poor lost master, . . Theron, none but thou! XVI. COVADONGA. Meantime Pelayo up the vale pursued Eastward his way, before the sun had climb'd Auseva's brow, or shed his silvering beams Upon Europa's summit, where the snows Through all revolving seasons hold their seat. A happy man he went, his heart at rest, Of hope and virtue and affection full, To all exhilarating influences Of earth and heaven alive. With kindred joy He heard the lark, who from her airy height, On twinkling pinions poised, pour'd forth profuse, In thrilling sequence of exuberant song, As one whose joyous nature overflow'd With life and power, her rich and rapturous strain. The early bee, buzzing along the way, From flower to flower, bore gladness on its wing To his rejoicing sense; and he pursued, With quicken'd eye alert, the frolic hare, Where from the green herb in her wanton path She brush'd away the dews. For he long time, Far from his home and from his native hills, Had dwelt in bondage; and the mountain breeze, Which he had with the breath of infancy Inhaled, such impulse to his heart restored, As if the seasons had roll'd back, and life Enjoy'd a second spring. Through fertile fields He went, by cots with pear-trees overbower'd, Or spreading to the sun their trelliced vines; Through orchards now, and now by thymy banks, Where wooden hives in some warm nook were hid From wind and shower; and now thro' shadowy paths, Where hazels fringed Pionia's vocal stream; Till where the loftier hills to narrower bound Confine the vale, he reach'd those huts remote Which should hereafter to the noble line Of Soto origin and name impart: A gallant lineage, long in fields of war And faithful chronicler's enduring page Blazon'd: but most by him illustrated, Avid of gold, yet greedier of renown, Whom not the spoils of Atabalipa Could satisfy insatiate, nor the fame Of that wide empire overthrown appease; But he to Florida's disastrous shores In evil hour his gallant comrades led, Through savage woods and swamps, and hostile tribes, The Apalachian arrows, and the snares Of wilier foes, hunger, and thirst, and toil; Till from ambition's feverish dream the touch Of Death awoke him; and when he had seen The fruit of all his treasures, all his toil, Foresight, and long endurance, fade away, Earth to the restless one refusing rest, In the great river's midland bed he left His honour'd bones. A mountain rivulet, Now calm and lovely in its summer course, Held by those huts its everlasting way Towards Pionia. They whose flocks and herds Drink of its water call it Deva. Here Pelayo southward up the ruder vale Traced it, his guide unerring. Amid heaps Of mountain wreck, on either side thrown high, The wide-spread traces of its wintry might, The tortuous channel wound; o'er beds of sand Here silently it flows; here from the rock Rebutted, curls and eddies; plunges here Precipitate; here roaring among crags, It leaps and foams and whirls and hurries on. Grey alders here and bushy hazels hid The mossy side; their wreath'd and knotted feet Bared by the current, now against its force Repaying the support they found, upheld The bank secure. Here, bending to the stream, The birch fantastic stretch'd its rugged trunk, Tall and erect from whence, as from their base, Each like a tree, its silver branches grew. The cherry here hung for the birds of heaven Its rosy fruit on high. The elder there Its purple berries o'er the water bent, Heavily hanging. Here, amid the brook, Grey as the stone to which it clung, half root, Half trunk, the young ash rises from the rock; And there its parent lifts a lofty head, And spreads its graceful boughs; the passing wind With twinkling motion lifts the silent leaves, And shakes its rattling trufts. Soon had the Prince Behind him left the farthest dwelling-place Of man; no fields of waving corn were here, Nor wicker storehouse for the autumnal grain, Vineyard, nor bowery fig, nor fruitful grove; Only the rocky vale, the mountain stream, Incumbent crags, and hills that over hills Arose on either hand, here hung with woods, Here rich with heath, that o'er some smooth ascent Its purple glory spread, or golden gorse; Bare here, and striated with many a hue, Scored by the wintry rain; by torrents here Riven, and with overhanging rocks abrupt. Pelayo, upward as he cast his eyes Where crags loose-hanging o'er the narrow pass Impended, there beheld his country's strength Insuperable, and in his heart rejoiced. Oh that the Musselman were here, he cried, With all his myriads! While thy day endures, Moor! thou may'st lord it in the plains; but here Hath Nature for the free and brave prepared A sanctuary, where no oppressor's power, No might of human tyranny can pierce. The tears which started then sprang not alone From lofty thoughts of elevating joy; For love and admiration had their part, And virtuous pride. Here then thou hast retired, My Gaudiosa! in his heart he said; Excellent woman! ne'er was richer boon By fate benign to favour'd man indulged, Than when thou wert before the face of Heaven Given me to be my children's mother, brave And virtuous as thou art! Here thou hast fled, Thou who wert nurst in palaces, to dwell Inrocks and mountain caves! . . The thought was proud, Yet not without a sense of inmost pain; For never had Pelayo till that hour So deeply felt the force of solitude. High over head the eagle soar'd serene, And the grey lizard on the rocks below Bask'd in the sun: no living creature else In this remotest wilderness was seen; Nor living voice was there, . . only the flow Of Deva, and the rushing of its springs Long in the distance heard, which nearer now, With endless repercussion deep and loud, Throbb'd on the dizzy sense. The ascending vale, Long straiten'd by the narrowing mountains, here Was closed. In front a rock, abrupt and bare, Stood eminent, in height exceeding far All edifice of human power, by King Or Caliph, or barbaric Sultan rear'd, Or mightier tyrants of the world of old, Assyrian or Egyptian, in their pride; Yet far above, beyond the reach of sight, Swell after swell, the heathery mountain rose. Here, in two sources, from the living rock The everlasting springs of Deva gush'd. Upon a smooth and grassy plat below, By Nature there as for an altar drest, They join'd their sister stream, which from the earth Well'd silently. In such a scene rude man With pardonable error might have knelt, Feeling a present Deity, and made His offering to the fountain Nymph devout. The arching rock disclosed above the springs A cave, where hugest son of giant birth, That e'er of old in forest of romance 'Gainst knights and ladies waged discourteous war, Erect within the portal might have stood. The broken stone allow'd for hand and foot No difficult ascent, above the base In height a tall man's stature, measured thrice. No holier spot than Covadonga Spain Boasts in her wide extent, though all her realms Be with the noblest blood of martyrdom In elder or in later days enrich'd, And glorified with tales of heavenly aid By many a miracle made manifest; Nor in the heroic annals of her fame Doth she show forth a scene of more renown. Then, save the hunter, drawn in keen pursuit Beyond his wonted haunts, or shepherd's boy, Following the pleasure of his straggling flock, None knew the place. Pelayo, when he saw Those glittering sources and their sacred cave, Took from his side the bugle silver-tipt, And with a breath long drawn and slow expired Sent forth that strain, which, echoing from the walls Of Cangas, wont to tell his glad return When from the chace he came. At the first sound Favila started in the cave, and cried, My father's horn! . . A sudden flush suffused Hermesind's cheek, and she with quicken'd eye Look'd eager to her mother silently; But Gaudiosa trembled and grew pale, Doubting her sense deceived. A second time The bugle breathed its well-known notes abroad; And Hermesind around her mother's neck Threw her white arms, and earnestly exclaim'd, 'Tis he! . . But when a third and broader blast Rung in the echoing archway, ne'er did wand, With magic power endued, call up a sight So strange, as sure in that wild solitude It seem'd, when from the bowels of the rock The mother and her children hastened forth; She in the sober charms and dignity Of womanhood mature, nor verging yet Upon decay; in gesture like a Queen, Such inborn and habitual majesty Ennobled all her steps, . . or Priestess, chosen Because within such faultless work of Heaven Inspiring Deity might seem to make Its habitation known... Favila such In form and stature as the Sea Nymph's son, When that wise Centaur from his cave well-pleased Beheld the boy divine his growing strength Against some shaggy lionet essay, And fixing in the half-grown mane his hands, Roll with him in fierce dalliance intertwined. But like a creature of some higher sphere His sister came; she scarcely touch'd the rock, So light was Hermesind's aërial speed. Beauty and grace and innocence in her In heavenly union shone. One who had held The faith of elder Greece, would sure have thought She was some glorious nymph of seed divine, Oread or Dryad, of Diana's train The youngest and the loveliest: yea she seem'd Angel, or soul beatified, from realms Of bliss, on errand of parental love To earth re-sent, . . if tears and trembling limbs With such celestial natures might consist. Embraced by all, in turn embracing each, The husband and the father for awhile Forgot his country and all things beside: Life hath few moments of such pure delight, Such foretaste of the perfect joy of Heaven. And when the thought recurr'd of sufferings past, Perils which threaten'd still, and arduous toil Yet to be undergone, remember'd griefs Heighten'd the present happiness; and hope Upon the shadows of futurity Shone like the sun upon the morning mists, When driven before his rising rays they roll, And melt and leave the prospect bright and clear. When now Pelayo's eyes had drank their fill Of love from those dear faces, he went up To view the hiding place. Spacious it was As that Sicilian cavern in the hill Wherein earth-shaking Neptune's giant son Duly at eve was wont to fold his flock, Ere the wise Ithacan, over that brute force By wiles prevailing, for a life-long night Seel'd his broad eye. The healthful air had here Free entrance, and the cheerful light of heaven; But at the end, an opening in the floor Of rock disclosed a wider vault below, Which never sun-beam visited, nor breath Of vivifying morning came to cheer. No light was there but that which from above In dim reflection fell, or found its way, Broken and quivering, through the glassy stream, Where through the rock it gush'd. That shadowy light Sufficed to show, where from their secret bed The waters issued; with whose rapid course, And with whose everlasting cataracts Such motion to the chill damp atmosphere Was given, as if the solid walls of rock Were shaken with the sound. Glad to respire The upper air, Pelayo hasten'd back From that drear den. Look! Hermesind exclaim'd, Taking her father's hand, thou hast not seen My chamber: . . See! . . did ever ring-dove chuse In so secure a nook her hiding-place, Or build a warmer nest? 'Tis fragrant too, As warm, and not more sweet than soft; for thyme And myrtle with the elastic heath are laid, And, over all, this dry and pillowy moss... Smiling she spake. Pelayo kiss'd the child, And, sighing, said within himself, I trust In Heaven, whene'er thy May of life is come, Sweet bird, that thou shalt have a blither bower! Fitlier, he thought, such chamber might beseem Some hermit of Hilarion's school austere, Or old Antonius, he who from the hell Of his bewilder'd phantasy saw fiends In actual vision, a foul throng grotesque Of all horrific shapes and forms obscene Crowd in broad day before his open eyes. That feeling cast a momentary shade Of sadness o'er his soul. But deeper thoughts, If he might have foreseen the things to come, Would there have fill'd him; for within that cave His own remains were one day doom'd to find Their final place of rest; and in that spot, Where that dear child with innocent delight Had spread her mossy couch, the sepulchre Shall in the consecrated rock be hewn, Where with Alphonso, her beloved lord, Laid side by side, must Hermesind partake The everlasting marriage-bed, when he, Leaving a name perdurable on earth, Hath changed his earthly for a heavenly crown. Dear child, upon that fated spot she stood, In all the beauty of her opening youth, In health's rich bloom, in virgin innocence, While her eyes sparkled and her heart o'erflow'd With pure and perfect joy of filial love. Many a slow century since that day hath fill'd Its course, and countless multitudes have trod With pilgrim feet that consecrated cave; Yet not in all those ages, amid all The untold concourse, hath one breast been swoln With such emotions as Pelayo felt That hour. O Gaudiosa, he exclaim'd, And thou couldst seek for shelter here, amid This aweful solitude, in mountain caves! Thou noble spirit! Oh when hearts like thine Grow on this sacred soil, would it not be In me, thy husband, double infamy, And tenfold guilt, if I despair'd of Spain? In all her visitations, favouring Heaven Hath left her still the unconquerable mind; And thus being worthy of redemption, sure Is she to be redeem'd. Beholding her Through tears he spake, and prest upon her lips A kiss of deepest love. Think ever thus, She answer'd, and that faith will give the power In which it trusts. When to this mountain hold These children, thy dear images, I brought, I said within myself, where should they fly But to the bosom of their native hills? I brought them here as to a sanctuary, Where, for the temple's sake, the indwelling God Would guard his supplicants. O my dear Lord, Proud as I was to know that they were thine, Was it a sin if I almost believed, That Spain, her destiny being link'd with theirs, Must save the precious charge? So let us think, The chief replied, so feel and teach and act. Spain is our common parent: let the sons Be to the parent true, and in her strength And Heaven, their sure deliverance they will find. XVII. RODERICK AND SIVERIAN. O holiest Mary, Maid and Mother! thou In Covadonga, at thy rocky shrine, Hast witness'd whatsoe'er of human bliss Heart can conceive most perfect! Faithful love, Long crost by envious stars, hath there attain'd Its crown, in endless matrimony given; The youthful mother there hath to the font Her first-born borne, and there, with deeper sense Of gratitude for that dear babe redeem'd From threatening death, return'd to pay her vows. But ne'er on nuptial, nor baptismal day, Nor from their grateful pilgrimage discharged, Did happier group their way down Deva's vale Rejoicing hold, than this blest family, O'er whom the mighty Spirit of the Land Spread his protecting wings. The children, free In youthhead's happy season from all cares That might disturb the hour, yet capable Of that intense and unalloyed delight Which childhood feels when it enjoys again The dear parental presence long deprived; Nor were the parents now less bless'd than they, Even to the height of human happiness; For Gaudiosa and her Lord that hour Let no misgiving thoughts intrude: she fix'd Her hopes on him, and his were fix'd on Heaven; And hope in that courageous heart derived Such rooted strength and confidence assured In righteousness, that 'twas to him like faith.. An everlasting sunshine of the soul, Illumining and quickening all its powers. But on Pionia's side meantime a heart As generous, and as full of noble thoughts, Lay stricken with the deadliest bolts of grief. Upon a smooth grey stone sate Roderick there; The wind above him stirr'd the hazel boughs, And murmuring at his feet the river ran. He sate with folded arms and head declined Upon his breast, feeding on bitter thoughts, Till nature gave him in the exhausted sense Of woe a respite something like repose; And then the quiet sound of gentle winds And waters with their lulling consonance Beguiled him of himself. Of all within Oblivious there he sate, sentient alone Of outward nature, . . of the whispering leaves That soothed his ear, . . the genial breath of Heaven That fann'd his cheek, . . the stream's perpetual flow, That, with its shadows and its glancing lights, Dimples and thread-like motions infinite, For ever varying and yet still the same, Like time toward eternity, ran by. Resting his head upon his master's knees, Upon the bank beside him Theron lay. What matters change of state and circumstance, Or lapse of years, with all their dread events, To him? What matters it that Roderick wears The crown no longer, nor the sceptre wields? .. It is the dear-loved hand, whose friendly touch Had flatter'd him so oft; it is the voice, At whose glad summons to the field so oft From slumber he had started, shaking off Dreams of the chace, to share the actual joy; The eye, whose recognition he was wont To watch and welcome with exultant tongue. A coming step, unheard by Roderick, roused His watchful ear, and turning he beheld Siverian. Father, said the good old man, As Theron rose and fawn'd about his knees, Hast thou some charm, which draws about thee thus The hearts of all our house, . . even to the beast That lacks discourse of reason, but too oft, With uncorrupted feeling and dumb faith, Puts lordly man to shame? . . The king replied, 'Tis that mysterious sense by which mankind To fix their friendships and their loves are led, And which with fainter influence doth extend To such poor things as this. As we put off The cares and passions of this fretful world, It may be too that we thus far approach To elder nature, and regain in part The privilege through sin in Eden lost. The timid hare soon learns that she may trust The solitary penitent, and birds Will light upon the hermit's harmless hand. Thus Roderick answer'd in excursive speech, Thinking to draw the old man's mind from what Might touch him else too nearly, and himself Disposed to follow on the lure he threw, As one whom such imaginations led Out of the world of his own miseries. But to regardless ears his words were given, For on the dog Siverian gazed the while, Pursuing his own thoughts. Thou hast not felt, Exclaim'd the old man, the earthquake and the storm; The kingdom's overthrow, the wreck of Spain, The ruin of thy royal master's house, Have reach'd not thee! . . Then turning to the King, When the destroying enemy drew nigh Toledo, he continued, and we fled Before their fury, even while her grief Was fresh, my Mistress would not leave behind This faithful creature. Well we knew she thought Of Roderick then, although she named him not; For never since the fatal certainty Fell on us all, hath that unhappy name, Save in her prayers, been known to pass her lips Before this day. She names him now, and weeps; But now her tears are tears of thankfulness, For blessed hath thy coming been to her And all who loved the King. His faltering voice Here fail'd him, and he paused: recovering soon, When that poor injured Lady, he pursued, Did in my presence to the Prince absolve The unhappy King..... Absolve him! Roderick cried, And in that strong emotion turn'd his face Sternly toward Siverian, for the sense Of shame and self-reproach drove from his mind All other thoughts. The good old man replied, Of human judgements humanly I speak. Who knows not what Pelayo's life hath been? Not happier in all dear domestic ties, Than worthy for his virtue of the bliss Which is that virtue's fruit; and yet did he Absolve, upon Florinda's tale, the King. Siverian, thus he said, what most I hoped, And still within my secret heart believed, Is now made certain. Roderick hath been More sinn'd against than sinning. And with that He claspt his hands, and, lifting them to Heaven, Cried, Would to God that he were yet alive! For not more gladly did I draw my sword Against Witiza in our common cause, Than I would fight beneath his banners now, And vindicate his name! Did he say this? The Prince? Pelayo? in astonishment Roderick exclaim'd... He said it, quoth the old man. None better knew his kinsman's noble heart, None loved him better, none bewail'd him more: And as he felt, like me, for his reproach A deeper grief than for his death, even so He cherish'd in his heart the constant thought Something was yet untold, which, being known, Would palliate his offence, and make the fall Of one till then so excellently good, Less monstrous, less revolting to belief, More to be pitied, more to be forgiven. While thus he spake, the fall'n King felt his face Burn, and his blood flow fast. Down, guilty thoughts! Firmly he said within his soul; lie still, Thou heart of flesh! I thought thou hadst been quell'd, And quell'd thou shalt be! Help me, O my God. That I may crucify this inward foe! Yea, thou hast help'd me, Father! I am strong, O Saviour, in thy strength. As he breath'd thus His inward supplications, the old man Eyed him with frequent and unsteady looks. He had a secret trembling on his lips, And hesitated, still irresolute In utterance to embody the dear hope: Fain would he have it strengthen'd and assured By this concording judgement, yet he fear'd To have it chill'd in cold accoil. At length Venturing, he brake with interrupted speech The troubled silence. Father Maccabee, I cannot rest till I have laid my heart Open before thee. When Pelayo wish'd That his poor kinsman were alive to rear His banner once again, a sudden thought.. A hope.. a fancy.. what shall it be call'd? Possess'd me, that perhaps the wish might see Its glad accomplishment, . . that Roderick lived, And might in glory take the field once more For Spain.... I see thou startest at the thought! Yet spurn it not with hasty unbelief, As though 'twere utterly beyond the scope Of possible contingency. I think That I have calmly satisfied myself How this is more than idle fancy, more Than mere imaginations of a mind Which from its wishes builds a baseless faith. His horse, his royal robe, his horned helm, His mail and sword were found upon the field; But if King Roderick had in battle fallen, That sword, I know, would only have been found Clench'd in the hand which, living, knew so well To wield the dreadful steel! Not in the throng Confounded, nor amid the torpid stream, Opening with ignominious arms a way For flight, would he have perish'd! Where the strife Was hottest, ring'd about with slaughter'd foes, Should Roderick have been found: by this sure mark Ye should have known him, if nought else remain'd, That his whole body had been gored with wounds, And quill'd with spears, as if the Moors had felt That in his single life the victory lay, More than in all the host! Siverian's eyes Shone with a youthful ardour while he spake, His gathering brow grew stern, and as he raised His arm, a warrior's impulse character'd The impassion'd gesture. But the King was calm And heard him with unchanging countenance; For he had taken his resolve, and felt Once more the peace of God within his soul, As in that hour when by his father's grave He knelt before Pelayo. Soon the old man Pursued in calmer tones, . . Thus much I dare Believe, that Roderick fell not on that day When treason brought about his overthrow. If yet he live, for sure I think I know His noble mind, 'tis in some wilderness, Where, in some savage den inhumed, he drags The weary load of life, and on his flesh As on a mortal enemy, inflicts Fierce vengeance with immitigable hand. Oh that I knew but where to bend my way In his dear search! my voice perhaps might reach His heart, might reconcile him to himself, Restore him to his mother ere she dies, His people and his country: with the sword, Them and his own good name should he redeem. Oh might I but behold him once again Leading to battle these intrepid bands, Such as he was, . . yea rising from his fall More glorious, more beloved! Soon I believe Joy would accomplish then what grief hath fail'd To do with this old heart, and I should die Clasping his knees with such intense delight, That when I woke in Heaven, even Heaven itself Could have no higher happiness in store. Thus fervently he spake, and copious tears Ran down his cheeks. Full oft the Royal Goth, Since he came forth again among mankind, Had trembled lest some curious eye should read His lineaments too closely; now he long'd To fall upon the neck of that old man, And give his full heart utterance. But the sense Of duty, by the pride of self-controul Corroborate, made him steadily repress His yearning nature. Whether Roderick live, Paying in penitence the bitter price Of sin, he answered, or if earth hath given Rest to his earthly part, is only known To him and Heaven. Dead is he to the world; And let not these imaginations rob His soul of thy continual prayers, whose aid Too surely, in whatever world, he needs. The faithful love that mitigates his fault, Heavenward addrest, may mitigate his doom. Living or dead, old man, be sure his soul, .. It were unworthy else, . . doth hold with thine Entire communion! Doubt not he relies Firmly on thee, as on a father's love, Counts on thy offices, and joins with thee In sympathy and fervent act of faith, Though regions, or though worlds, should intervene. Lost as he is, to Roderick this must be Thy first, best, dearest duty; next must be To hold right onward in that noble path, Which he would counsel, could his voice be heard. Now therefore aid me, while I call upon The Leaders and the People, that this day We may acclaim Pelayo for our King. XVIII. THE ACCLAMATION. Now, when from Covadonga, down the vale Holding his way, the princely mountaineer Came with that happy family in sight Of Cangas and his native towers, far off He saw before the gate, in fair array, The assembled land. Broad banners were display'd, And spears were sparkling to the sun, shields shone, And helmets glitter'd, and the blairing horn, With frequent sally of impatient joy, Provoked the echoes round. Well he areeds, From yonder ensigns and augmented force, That Odoar and the Primate from the west Have brought their aid; but wherefore all were thus Instructed as for some great festival, He found not, till Favila's quicker eye Catching the ready buckler, the glad boy Leapt up, and clapping his exultant hands, Shouted, King! King! my father shall be King This day! Pelayo started at the word, And the first thought which smote him brought a sigh For Roderick's fall; the second was of hope, Deliverance for his country, for himself Enduring fame, and glory for his line. That high prophetic forethought gather'd strength, As looking to his honour'd mate, he read Her soul's accordant augury; her eyes Brighten'd; the quicken'd action of the blood Tinged with a deeper hue her glowing cheek, And on her lips there sate a smile which spake The honourable pride of perfect love, Rejoicing, for her husband's sake, to share The lot he chose, the perils he defied, The lofty fortune which their faith foresaw. Roderick, in front of all the assembled troops, Held the broad buckler, following to the end That steady purpose to the which his zeal Had this day wrought the Chiefs. Tall as himself, Erect it stood beside him, and his hands Hung resting on the rim. This was an hour That sweeten'd life, repaid and recompensed All losses; and although it could not heal All griefs, yet laid them for awhile to rest. The active agitating joy that fill'd The vale, that with contagious influence spread Through all the exulting mountaineers, that gave New ardour to all spirits, to all breasts Inspired fresh impulse of excited hope, Moved every tongue, and strengthen'd every limb, .. That joy which every man reflected saw From every face of all the multitude, And heard in every voice, in every sound, Reach'd not the King. Aloof from sympathy, He from the solitude of his own soul Beheld the busy scene. None shared or knew His deep and incommunicable joy; None but that heavenly Father, who alone Beholds the struggles of the heart, alone Sees and rewards the secret sacrifice. Among the chiefs conspicuous, Urban stood, He whom, with well-weigh'd choice, in arduous time, To arduous office the consenting Church Had call'd when Sindered fear-smitten fled; Unfaithful shepherd, who for life alone Solicitous, forsook his flock, when most In peril and in suffering they required A pastor's care. Far off at Rome he dwells In ignominious safety, while the Church Keeps in her annals the deserter's name, But from the service which with daily zeal Devout her ancient prelacy recalls, Blots it, unworthy to partake her prayers. Urban, to that high station thus being call'd, From whence disanimating fear had driven The former primate, for the general weal Consulting first, removed with timely care The relics and the written works of Saints, Toledo's choicest treasure, prized beyond All wealth, their living and their dead remains; These to the mountain fastnesses he bore Of unsubdued Cantabria, there deposed, One day to be the boast of yet unbuilt Oviedo, and the dear idolatry Of multitudes unborn. To things of state Then giving thought mature, he held advice With Odoar, whom of counsel competent And firm of heart he knew. What then they plann'd, Time and the course of over-ruled events To earlier act had ripen'd, than their hope Had ever in its gladdest dream proposed; And here by agents unforeseen, and means Beyond the scope of foresight brought about, This day they saw their dearest heart's desire Accorded them: All-able Providence Thus having ordered all, that Spain this hour With happiest omens, and on surest base, Should from its ruins rear again her throne. For acclamation and for sacring now One form must serve, more solemn for the breach Of old observances, whose absence here Deeplier impress'd the heart, than all display Of regal pomp and wealth pontifical, Of vestments radiant with their gems, and stiff With ornature of gold; the glittering train, The long procession, and the full-voiced choir. This day the forms of piety and war, In strange but fitting union must combine. Not in his alb and cope and orary Came Urban now, nor wore he mitre here, Precious or auriphrygiate; bare of head He stood, all else in arms complete, and o'er His gorget's iron rings the pall was thrown Of wool undyed, which on the Apostle's tomb Gregory had laid, and sanctified with prayer; That from the living Pontiff and the dead Replete with holiness, it might impart Doubly derived its grace. One Page beside Bore his broad-shadow'd helm; another's hand Held the long spear, more suited in these times For Urban, than the crosier richly wrought With silver foliature, the elaborate work Of Grecian or Italian artist, train'd In the eastern capital, or sacred Rome, Still o'er the West predominant, though fallen. Better the spear befits the shepherd's hand When robbers break the fold. Now he had laid The weapon by, and held a natural cross Of rudest form, unpeel'd, even as it grew On the near oak that morn. Mutilate alike Of royal rites was this solemnity. Where was the rubied crown, the sceptre where, And where the golden pome, the proud array Of ermines, aureate vests, and jewelry, With all which Leuvigild for after kings Left, ostentatious of his power? The Moor Had made his spoil of these, and on the field Of Xeres, where contending multitudes Had trampled it beneath their bloody feet, The standard of the Goths forgotten lay Defiled, and rotting there in sun and rain. Utterly is it lost; nor ever more Herald or antiquary's patient search Shall from forgetfulness avail to save Those blazon'd arms, so fatally of old Renown'd through all the affrighted Occident. That banner, before which imperial Rome First to a conqueror bow'd her head abased; Which when the dreadful Hun, with all his powers, Came like a deluge rolling o'er the world, Made head, and in the front of battle broke His force, till then resistless; which so oft Had with alternate fortune braved the Frank: Driven the Byzantine from the farthest shores Of Spain, long lingering there, to final flight; And of their kingdoms and their name despoil'd The Vandal, and the Alan, and the Sueve; Blotted from human records is it now As it had never been. So let it rest With things forgotten! But Oblivion ne'er Shall cancel from the historic roll, nor Time, Who changeth all, obscure that fated sign, Which brighter now than mountain snows at noon To the bright sun displays its argent field. Rose not the vision then upon thy soul, O Roderick, when within that argent field Thou saw'st the rampant Lion, red as if Upon some noblest quarry he had roll'd, Rejoicing in his satiate rage, and drunk With blood and fury? Did the auguries Which open'd on thy spirit bring with them A perilous consolation, deadening heart And soul, yea worse than death, . . that thou through all Thy checquer'd way of life, evil and good, Thy errors and thy virtues, had'st but been The poor mere instrument of things ordain'd, .. Doing or suffering, impotent alike To will or act, . . perpetually bemock'd With semblance of volition, yet in all Blind worker of the ways of destiny! That thought intolerable, which in the hour Of woe indignant conscience had repell'd, As little might it find reception now, When the regenerate spirit self-approved Beheld its sacrifice complete. With faith Elate, he saw the banner'd Lion float Refulgent, and recall'd that thrilling shout Which he had heard when on Romano's grave The joy of victory woke him from his dream, And sent him with prophetic hope to work Fulfilment of the great events ordain'd, There in imagination's inner world Prefigured to his soul. Alone, advanced Before the ranks, the Goth in silence stood, While from all voices round, loquacious joy Mingled its buzz continuous with the blast Of horn, shrill pipe, and tinkling cymbals' clash, And sound of deafening drum. But when the Prince Drew nigh, and Urban with the Cross upheld Stept forth to meet him, all at once were still'd With instantaneous hush; as when the wind, Before whose violent gusts the forest oaks, Tossing like billows their tempestuous heads, Roar like a raging sea, suspends its force, And leaves so dead a calm that not a leaf Moves on the silent spray. The passing air Bore with it from the woodland undisturb'd The ringdove's wooing, and the quiet voice Of waters warbling near. Son of a race Of Heroes and of Kings! the Primate thus Address'd him, Thou in whom the Gothic blood, Mingling with old Iberia's, hath restored To Spain a ruler of her native line, Stand forth, and in the face of God and man Swear to uphold the right, abate the wrong, With equitable hand, protect the Cross Whereon thy lips this day shall seal their vow, And underneath that hallow'd symbol, wage Holy and inextinguishable war Against the accursëd nation that usurps Thy country's sacred soil! So speak of me Now and for ever, O my countrymen! Replied Pelayo; and so deal with me Here and hereafter, thou, Almighty God, In whom I put my trust! Lord God of Hosts, Urban pursued, of Angels and of Men Creator and Disposer, King of Kings, Ruler of Earth and Heaven, . . look down this day, And multiply thy blessings on the head Of this thy servant, chosen in thy sight! Be thou his counsellor, his comforter, His hope, his joy, his refuge, and his strength; Crown him with justice, and with fortitude, Defend him with thine all-sufficient shield, Surround him every where with the right hand Of thine all-present power, and with the might Of thine omnipotence, send in his aid Thy unseen Angels forth, that potently And royally against all enemies He may endure and triumph! Bless the land O'er which he is appointed; bless thou it With the waters of the firmament, the springs Of the low-lying deep, the fruits which Sun And Moon mature for man, the precious stores Of the eternal hills, and all the gifts Of Earth, its wealth and fulness! Then he took Pelayo's hand, and on his finger placed The mystic circlet... With this ring, O Prince, To our dear Spain, who like a widow now Mourneth in desolation, I thee wed: For weal or woe thou takest her, till death Dispart the union: Be it blest to her, To thee, and to thy seed! Thus when he ceased, He gave the awaited signal. Roderick brought The buckler: Eight for strength and stature chosen Came to their honour'd office: Round the shield Standing, they lower it for the Chieftain's feet, Then, slowly raised upon their shoulders, lift The steady weight. Erect Pelayo stands, And thrice he brandishes the burnish'd sword, While Urban to the assembled people cries, Spaniards, behold your King! The multitude Then sent forth all their voice with glad acclaim, Raising the loud Real; thrice did the word Ring through the air, and echo from the walls Of Cangas. Far and wide the thundering shout, Rolling among reduplicating rocks, Peal'd o'er the hills, and up the mountain vales. The wild ass starting in the forest glade Ran to the covert; the affrighted wolf Skulk'd through the thicket to a closer brake; The sluggish bear, awakened in his den, Roused up and answer'd with a sullen growl, Low-breathed and long; and at the uproar scared, The brooding eagle from her nest took wing. Heroes and Chiefs of old! and ye who bore Firm to the last your part in that dread strife, When Julian and Witiza's viler race Betray'd their country, hear ye from yon Heaven The joyful acclamation which proclaims That Spain is born again! O ye who died In that disastrous field, and ye who fell Embracing with a martyr's love your death Amid the flames of Auria; and all ye Victims innumerable, whose cries unheard On earth, but heard in Heaven, from all the land Went up for vengeance; not in vain ye cry Before the eternal throne! . . Rest innocent blood! Vengeance is due, and vengeance will be given, Rest innocent blood! The appointed age is come! The star that harbingers a glorious day Hath risen! Lo there the Avenger stands! Lo there He brandishes the avenging sword! Lo there The avenging banner spreads its argent field Refulgent with auspicious light! . . Rejoice, O Leon, for thy banner is displayed, Rejoice with all thy mountains, and thy vales And streams! And thou, O Spain, through all thy realms, For thy deliverance cometh! Even now, As from all sides the miscreant hosts move on; .. From southern Betis; from the western lands, Where through redundant vales smooth Minho flows, And Douro pours through vine-clad hills the wealth Of Leon's gathered waters; from the plains Burgensian, in old time Vardulia call'd, But in their castellated strength ere long To be design'd Castille, a deathless name; From midland regions where Toledo reigns Proud city on her royal eminence, And Tagus bends his sickle round the scene Of Roderick's fall; from rich Rioja's fields; Dark Ebro's shores; the walls of Salduba, Seat of the Sedetanians old, by Rome Cæsarian and August denominate. Now Zaragoza, in this later time Above all cities of the earth renown'd For duty perfectly perform'd; . . East, West And South, where'er their gather'd multitudes Urged by the speed of vigorous tyranny, With more than with commeasurable strength Haste to prevent the danger, crush the hopes Of rising Spain, and rivet round her neck The eternal yoke, ... the ravenous fowls of heaven Flock there presentient of their food obscene, Following the accursed armies, whom too well They know their purveyors long. Pursue their march, Ominous attendants! Ere the moon hath fill'd Her horns, these purveyors shall become the prey, And ye on Moorish not on Christian flesh Wearying your beaks, shall clog your scaly feet With foreign gore. Soon will ye learn to know, Followers and harbingers of blood, the flag Of Leon where it bids you to your feast! Terror and flight shall with that flag go forth, And Havoc and the Dogs of War and Death. Thou Covadonga with the tainted stream Of Deva, and this now rejoicing vale, Soon its primitial triumphs wilt behold! Nor shall the glories of the noon be less Than such miraculous promise of the dawn: Witness Clavijo, where the dreadful cry Of Santiago, then first heard, o'erpower'd The Akbar, and that holier name blasphemed By misbelieving lips! Simancas, thou Be witness! And do ye your record bear, Tolosan mountains, where the Almohade Beheld his myriads scatter'd and destroy'd, Like locusts swept before the stormy North! Thou too, Salado, on that later day When Africa received her final foil, And thy swoln stream incarnadined, roll'd back The invaders to the deep, . . there shall they toss Till on their native Mauritanian shore The waves shall cast their bones to whiten there. XIX. RODERICK AND RUSILLA. When all had been perform'd, the royal Goth Look'd up towards the chamber in the tower, Where gazing on the multitude below, Alone Rusilla stood. He met her eye, For it was singling him amid the crowd; Obeying then the hand which beckon'd him, He went with heart prepared, nor shrinking now, But arm'd with self-approving thoughts that hour. Entering in tremulous haste, he closed the door, And turn'd to clasp her knees; but lo, she spread Her arms, and catching him in close embrace, Fell on his neck, and cried, My Son, my Son! ... Ere long, controlling that first agony With effort of strong will, backward she bent, And gazing on his head now shorn and grey, And on his furrow'd countenance, exclaim'd, Still, still, my Roderick! the same noble mind! The same heroic heart! Still, still, my Son; ... Changed, . . yet not wholly fallen, . . not wholly lost, He cried, . . not wholly in the sight of Heaven Unworthy, O my Mother, nor in thine! She lock'd her arms again around his neck, Saying, Lord, let me now depart in peace! And bow'd her head again, and silently Gave way to tears. When that first force was spent, And passion in exhaustment found relief, .. I knew thee, said Rusilla, when the dog Rose from my feet, and lick'd his master's hand. All flash'd upon me then; the instinctive sense That goes unerringly where reason fails, .. The voice, the eye, . . a mother's thoughts are quick, .. Miraculous as it seem'd, . . Siverian's tale, .. Florinda's, . . every action, . . every word, .. Each strengthening each, and all confirming all, Reveal'd thee, O my Son! but I restrain'd My heart, and yielded to thy holier will The thoughts which rose to tempt a soul not yet Wean'd wholly from the world. What thoughts? replied Roderick. That I might see thee yet again Such as thou wert, she answer'd; not alone To Heaven and me restored, but to thyself, .. Thy Crown, . . thy Country, . . all within thy reach; Heaven so disposing all things, that the means Which wrought the ill, might work the remedy. Methought I saw thee once again the hope, .. The strength, . . the pride of Spain! The miracle Which I beheld made all things possible. I know the inconstant people, how their mind, With every breath of good or ill report, Fluctuates, like summer corn before the breeze; Quick in their hatred, quicker in their love, Generous and hasty, soon would they redress All wrongs of former obloquy... I thought Of happiness restored, . . the broken heart Heal'd, . . and Count Julian, for his daughter's sake, Turning in thy behalf against the Moors His powerful sword: . . all possibilities That could be found or fancied, built a dream Before me; such as easiest might illude A lofty spirit train'd in palaces, And not alone amid the flatteries Of youth with thoughts of high ambition fed When all is sunshine, but through years of woe, When sorrow sanctified their use, upheld By honourable pride and earthly hopes. I thought I yet might nurse upon my knee Some young Theodofred, and see in him Thy Father's image and thine own renew'd, And love to think the little hand which there Play'd with the bauble, should in after days Wield the transmitted sceptre; . . that through him The ancient seed should be perpetuate, .. That precious seed revered so long, desired So dearly, and so wonderously preserved. Nay, he replied, Heaven hath not with its bolts Scathed the proud summit of the tree, and left The trunk unflaw'd; ne'er shall it clothe its boughs Again, nor push again its scyons forth, Head, root, and branch, all mortified alike! .. Long ere these locks were shorn had I cut off The thoughts of royalty! Time might renew Their growth, as for Manoah's captive son, And I too on the miscreant race, like him, Might prove my strength regenerate; but the hour, When in its second best nativity, My soul was born again through grace, this heart Died to the world. Dreams such as thine pass now Like evening clouds before me; if I think How beautiful they seem, 'tis but to feel How soon they fade, how fast the night shuts in. But in that World to which my hopes look on, Time enters not, nor Mutability; Beauty and goodness are unfading there; Whatever there is given us to enjoy, That we enjoy for ever, still the same... Much might Count Julian's sword atchieve for Spain And me, but more will his dear daughter's soul Effect in Heaven; and soon will she be there An Angel at the throne of Grace, to plead In his behalf and mine. I knew thy heart, She answer'd, and subdued the vain desire. It was the World's last effort. Thou hast chosen The better part. Yes, Roderick, even on earth There is a praise above the monarch's fame, A higher, holier, more enduring praise, And this will yet be thine! O tempt me not, Mother! he cried; nor let ambition take That specious form to cheat us! What but this, Fallen as I am, have I to offer Heaven? The ancestral sceptre, public fame, content Of private life, the general good report, Power, reputation, happiness, . . whate'er The heart of man desires to constitute His earthly weal, . . unerring Justice claim'd In forfeiture. I with submitted soul Bow to the righteous law and kiss the rod. Only while thus submitted, suffering thus, .. Only while offering up that name on earth, Perhaps in trial offer'd to my choice, Could I present myself before thy sight; Thus only could endure myself, or fix My thoughts upon that fearful pass, where Death Stands in the Gate of Heaven! . . Time passes on, The healing work of sorrow is complete; All vain desires have long been weeded out, All vain regrets subdued; the heart is dead, The soul is ripe and eager for her birth. Bless me, my Mother! and come when it will The inevitable hour, we die in peace. So saying, on her knees he bow'd his head; She raised her hands to Heaven and blest her child; Then bending forward, as he rose, embraced And claspt him to her heart, and cried, Once more Theodofred, with pride behold thy son! XX. THE MOORISH CAMP. The times are big with tidings; every hour From east and west and south the breathless scouts Bring swift alarums in; the gathering foe, Advancing from all quarters to one point, Close their wide crescent. Nor was aid of fear To magnify their numbers needed now, They came in myriads. Africa had pour'd Fresh shoals upon the coast of wretched Spain; Lured from their hungry deserts to the scene Of spoil, like vultures to the battle-field, Fierce, unrelenting, habited in crimes, Like bidden guests the mirthful ruffians flock To that free feast which in their Prophet's name Rapine and Lust proclaim'd. Nor were the chiefs Of victory less assured, by long success Elate, and proud of that o'erwhelming strength, Which, surely they believed, as it had roll'd Thus far uncheck'd would roll victorious on, Till, like the Orient, the subjected West Should bow in reverenee at Mahommed's name; And pilgrims, from remotest Arctic shores, Tread with religious feet the burning sands Of Araby, and Mecca's stony soil. Proud of his part in Roderick's overthrow, Their leader Abulcacem came, a man Immitigable, long in war renown'd. Here Magued comes, who on the conquer'd walls Of Cordoba, by treacherous fear betray'd, Planted the moony standard: Ibrahim here, He, who by Genil and in Darro's vales, Had for the Moors the fairest portion won Of all their spoils, fairest and best maintain'd, And to the Alpuxarras given in trust His other name, through them preserved in song. Here too Alcahman, vaunting his late deeds At Auria, all her children by the sword Cut off, her bulwarks rased, her towers laid low, Her dwellings by devouring flames consumed, Bloody and hard of heart, he little ween'd, Vain-boastful chief! that from those fatal flames The fire of retribution had gone forth Which soon should wrap him round. The renegades Here too were seen, Ebba and Sisibert; A spurious brood, but of their parent's crimes True heirs, in guilt begotten, and in ill Train'd up. The same unnatural rage that turn'd Their swords against their country, made them seek, Unmindful of their wretched mother's end, Pelayo's life. No enmity is like Domestic hatred. For his blood they thirst, As if that sacrifice might satisfy Witiza's guilty ghost, efface the shame Of their adulterous birth, and one crime more Crowning a hideous course, emancipate Thenceforth their spirits from all earthly fear. This was their only care; but other thoughts Were rankling in that elder villain's mind, Their kinsman Orpas, he of all the crew Who in this fatal visitation fell, The foulest and the falsest wretch that e'er Renounced his baptism. From his cherish'd views Of royalty cut off, he coveted Count Julian's wide domains, and hopeless now To gain them through the daughter, laid his toils Against the father's life, . . the instrument Of his ambition first, and now design'd Its victim. To this end with cautious hints, At favouring season ventured, he possess'd The leader's mind; then, subtly fostering The doubts himself had sown, with bolder charge He bade him warily regard the Count, Lest underneath an outward show of faith The heart uncircumcised were Christian still: Else, wherefore had Florinda not obey'd Her dear loved sire's example, and embraced The saving truth? Else, wherefore was her hand, Plighted to him so long, so long withheld, Till she had found a fitting hour to fly With that audacious Prince, who now in arms, Defied the Caliph's power; . . for who could doubt That in his company she fled, perhaps The mover of his flight? What if the Count Himself had plann'd the evasion which he feign'd In sorrow to condemn? What if she went A pledge assured, to tell the mountaineers That when they met the Musselmen in the heat Of fight, her father passing to their side Would draw the victory with him? . . Thus he breathed Fiend-like in Abulcacem's ear his schemes Of murderous malice; and the course of things, Ere long, in part approving his discourse, Aided his aim, and gave his wishes weight. For scarce on the Asturian territory Had they set foot, when, with the speed of fear, Count Eudon, nothing doubting that their force Would like a flood sweep all resistance down, Hasten'd to plead his merits: . . he alone, Found faithful in obedience through reproach And danger, when the madden'd multitude Hurried their chiefs along, and high and low With one infectious frenzy seized, provoked The invincible in arms. Pelayo led The raging crew, . . he doubtless the prime spring Of all these perilous movements; and 'twas said He brought the assurance of a strong support, Count Julian's aid, for in his company From Cordoba, Count Julian's daughter came. Thus Eudon spake before the assembled chiefs; When instantly a stern and wrathful voice Replied, I know Pelayo never made That senseless promise! He who raised the tale Lies foully; but the bitterest enemy That ever hunted for Pelayo's life Hath never with the charge of falsehood touch'd His name. The Baron had not recognized Till then, beneath the turban's shadowing folds, Julian's swart visage, where the fiery skies Of Africa, through many a year's long course, Had set their hue inburnt. Something he sought In quick excuse to say of common fame, Lightly believed and busily diffused, And that no enmity had moved his speech Repeating rumour's tale. Julian replied, Count Eudon, neither for thyself nor me Excuse is needed here. The path I tread Is one wherein there can be no return, No pause, no looking back! A choice like mine For time and for eternity is made, Once and for ever! and as easily The breath of vain report might build again The throne which my just vengeance overthrew, As in the Caliph and his Captain's mind Affect the opinion of my well-tried truth. The tidings which thou givest me of my child Touch me more vitally; bad though they be, A secret apprehension of aught worse Makes me with joy receive them. Then the Count To Abulcacem turn'd his speech, and said, I pray thee, Chief, give me a messenger By whom I may to this unhappy child Dispatch a father's bidding, such as yet May win her back. What I would say requires No veil of privacy; before ye all The errand shall be given. Boldly he spake, Yet wary in that show of open truth, For well he knew what dangers girt him round Amid the faithless race. Blind with revenge, For them in madness had he sacrificed His name, his baptism, and his native land, To feel, still powerful as he was, that life Hung on their jealous favour. But his heart Approved him now, where love, too long restrain'd, Resumed its healing influence, leading him Right on with no misgiving. Chiefs, he said, Hear me, and let your wisdom judge between Me and Prince Orpas! ... Known it is to all, Too well, what mortal injury provoked My spirit to that vengeance which your aid So signally hath given. A covenant We made when first our purpose we combined, That he should have Florinda for his wife, My only child, so should she be, I thought, Revenged and honour'd best. My word was given Truly, nor did I cease to use all means Of counsel or command, entreating her Sometimes with tears, seeking sometimes with threats Of an offended father's curse to enforce Obedience; that, she said, the Christian law Forbade, moreover she had vow'd herself A servant to the Lord. In vain I strove To win her to the Prophet's saving faith, Using perhaps a rigour to that end Beyond permitted means, and to my heart, Which loved her dearer than its own life-blood, Abhorrent. Silently she suffer'd all, Or when I urged her with most vehemence, Only replied, I knew her fix'd resolve, And craved my patience but a little while Till death should set her free. Touch'd as I was, I yet persisted, till at length to escape The ceaseless importunity, she fled: And verily I fear'd until this hour, My rigour to some fearfuller resolve Than flight, had driven my child. Chiefs, I appeal To each and all, and Orpas to thyself Especially, if, having thus essay'd All means that law and nature have allow'd To bend her will, I may not rightfully Hold myself free, that promise being void Which cannot be fulfill'd. Thou sayest then, Orpas replied, that from her false belief Her stubborn opposition drew its force. I should have thought that from the ways corrupt Of these idolatrous Christians, little care Might have sufficed to wean a duteous child, The example of a parent so beloved Leading the way; and yet I will not doubt Thou didst enforce with all sincerity And holy zeal upon thy daughter's mind The truths of Islam. Julian knit his brow, And scowling on the insidious renegade, He answer'd, By what reasoning my poor mind Was from the old idolatry reclaim'd, None better knows than Seville's mitred chief, Who first renouncing errors which he taught, Led me his follower to the Prophet's pale. Thy lessons I repeated as I could; Of graven images, unnatural vows, False records, fabling creeds, and juggling priests, Who making sanctity the cloak of sin, Laugh'd at the fools on whose credulity They fatten'd. To these arguments, whose worth Prince Orpas, least of all men, should impeach, I added, like a soldier bred in arms, And to the subtleties of schools unused, The flagrant fact, that Heaven with victory, Where'er they turn'd, attested and approved The chosen Prophet's arms. If thou wert still The mitred Metropolitan, and I Some wretch of Arian or of Hebrew race, Thy proper business then might be to pry, And question me for lurking flaws of faith. We Musselmen, Prince Orpas, live beneath A wiser law, which with the iniquities Of thine old craft, hath abrogated this Its foulest practice! As Count Julian ceased, From underneath his black and gather'd brow There went a look, which with these wary words Bore to the heart of that false renegade Their whole envenom'd meaning. Haughtily Withdrawing then his alter'd eyes, he said Too much of this! return we to the sum Of my discourse. Let Abulcacem say, In whom the Caliph speaks, if with all faith Having essay'd in vain all means to win My child's consent, I may not hold henceforth The covenant discharged. The Moor replied, Well hast thou said, and rightly may'st assure Thy daughter that the Prophet's holy law Forbids compulsion. Give thine errand now; The messenger is here. Then Julian said, Go to Pelayo, and from him entreat Admittance to my child, where'er she be. Say to her, that her father solemnly Annuls the covenant with Orpas pledged, Nor with solicitations, nor with threats, Will urge her more, nor from that liberty Of faith restrain her, which the Prophet's law, Liberal as Heaven from whence it came, to all Indulges. Tell her that her father says His days are number'd, and beseeches her By that dear love, which from her infancy Still he hath borne her, growing as she grew, Nursed in our weal and strengthen'd in our woe, She will not in the evening of his life Leave him forsaken and alone. Enough Of sorrow, tell her, have her injuries Brought on her father's head; let not her act Thus aggravate the burden. Tell her too, That when he pray'd her to return, he wept Profusely as a child; but bitterer tears Than ever fell from childhood's eyes, were those Which traced his hardy cheeks. With faltering voice He spake, and after he had ceased from speech His lip was quivering still. The Moorish chief Then to the messenger his bidding gave. Say, cried he, to these rebel infidels, Thus Abulcacem in the Caliph's name Exhorteth them: Repent and be forgiven! Nor think to stop the dreadful storm of war, Which conquering and to conquer must fulfil Its destined circle, rolling eastward now Back from the subjugated west, to sweep Thrones and dominions down, till in the bond Of unity all nations join, and Earth Acknowledge, as she sees one Sun in heaven, One God, one Chief, one Prophet, and one Law. Jerusalem, the holy City, bows To holier Mecca's creed; the Crescent shines Triumphant o'er the eternal pyramids; On the cold altars of the worshippers Of Fire, moss grows, and reptiles leave their slime; The African idolatries are fallen, And Europe's senseless gods of stone and wood Have had their day. Tell these misguided men, A moment for repentance yet is left, And mercy the submitted neck will spare Before the sword is drawn: but once unsheath'd, Let Auria witness how that dreadful sword Accomplisheth its work! They little know The Moors who hope in battle to withstand Their valour, or in flight escape their rage! Amid our deserts we hunt down the birds Of heaven, . . wings do not save them! Nor shall rocks, And holds, and fastnesses, avail to save These mountaineers. Is not the Earth the Lord's? And we, his chosen people, whom he sends To conquer and possess it in his name? XXI. THE FOUNTAIN IN THE FOREST. The second eve had closed upon their march Within the Asturian border, and the Moors Had pitch'd their tents amid an open wood Upon the mountain side. As day grew dim, Their scatter'd fires shone with distincter light Among the trees, above whose top the smoke Diffused itself, and stain'd the evening sky. Ere long the stir of occupation ceased, And all the murmur of the busy host Subsiding died away, as through the camp The crier from a knoll proclaim'd the hour For prayer appointed, and with sonorous voice, Thrice in melodious modulation full, Pronounced the highest name. There is no God But God, he cried; there is no God but God! Mahommed is the Prophet of the Lord! Come ye to prayer! to prayer! The Lord is great! There is no God but God! . . Thus he pronounced His ritual form, mingling with holiest truth The audacious name accurst. The multitude Made their ablutions in the mountain stream Obedient, then their faces to the earth Bent in formality of easy prayer. An arrow's flight above that mountain stream There was a little glade, where underneath A long smooth mossy stone a fountain rose. An oak grew near, and with its ample boughs O'ercanopied the spring; its fretted roots Emboss'd the bank, and on their tufted bark Grew plants which love the moisture and the shade; Short ferns, and longer leaves of wrinkled green Which bent toward the spring, and when the wind Made itself felt, just touch'd with gentle dip The glassy surface, ruffled ne'er but then, Save when a bubble rising from the depth Burst, and with faintest circles mark'd its place, Or if an insect skimm'd it with its wing, Or when in heavier drops the gather'd rain Fell from the oak's high bower. The mountain roe, When, having drank there, he would bound across, Drew up upon the bank his meeting feet, And put forth half his force. With silent lapse From thence through mossy banks the water stole, Then murmuring hastened to the glen below. Diana might have loved in that sweet spot To take her noontide rest; and when she stoopt Hot from the chase to drink, well pleased had seen Her own bright crescent, and the brighter face It crown'd, reflected there. Beside that spring Count Julian's tent was pitch'd upon the glade; There his ablutions Moor-like he perform'd, And Moor-like knelt in prayer, bowing his head Upon the mossy bank. There was a sound Of voices at the tent when he arose, And lo! with hurried step a woman came Toward him; rightly then his heart presaged, And ere he could behold her countenance, Florinda knelt, and with uplifted arms Embraced her sire. He raised her from the ground Kiss'd her, and claspt her to his heart, and said, Thou hast not then forsaken me, my child! Howe'er the inexorable will of Fate May in the world which is to come, divide Our everlasting destinies, in this Thou wilt not, O my child, abandon me! And then with deep and interrupted voice, Nor seeking to restrain his copious tears, My blessing be upon thy head, he cried, A father's blessing! Though all faiths were false, It should not lose its worth! . . She lock'd her hands Around his neck, and gazing in his face Through streaming tears, exclaim'd, Oh never more, Here or hereafter, never let us part! And breathing then a prayer in silence forth, The name of Jesus trembled on her tongue. Whom hast thou there? cried Julian, and drew back, Seeing that near them stood a meagre man In humble garb, who rested with raised hands On a long staff, bending his head like one Who when he hears the distant vesper-bell, Halts by the way, and, all unseen of men, Offers his homage in the eye of Heaven. She answered, Let not my dear father frown In anger on his child! Thy messenger Told me that I should be restrain'd no more From liberty of faith, which the new law Indulged to all; how soon my hour might come I knew not, and although that hour will bring Few terrors, yet methinks I would not be Without a Christian comforter in death. A Priest! exclaimed the Count, and drawing back, Stoopt for his turban that he might not lack Some outward symbol of apostacy; For still in war his wonted arms he wore, Nor for the scymitar had changed the sword Accustomed to his hand. He covered now His short grey hair, and under the white folds His swarthy brow, which gather'd as he rose, Darken'd. Oh frown not thus! Florinda said, A kind and gentle counsellor is this, One who pours balm into a wounded soul, And mitigates the griefs he cannot heal. I told him I had vow'd to pass my days A servant of the Lord, yet that my heart, Hearing the message of thy love, was drawn With powerful yearnings back. Follow thy heart, .. It answers to the call of duty here, He said, nor canst thou better serve the Lord Than at thy father's side. Count Julian's brow, While thus she spake, insensibly relax'd. A Priest, cried he, and thus with even hand Weigh vows and natural duty in the scale? In what old heresy hath he been train'd? Or in what wilderness hath he escaped The domineering Prelate's fire and sword? Come hither, man, and tell me who thou art! A sinner, Roderick, drawing nigh, replied; Brought to repentance by the grace of God, And trusting for forgiveness through the blood Of Christ in humble hope. A smile of scorn Julian assumed, but merely from the lips It came; for he was troubled while he gazed On the strong countenance and thoughtful eye Before him. A new law hath been proclaim'd, Said he, which overthrows in its career The Christian altars of idolatry. What think'st thou of the Prophet? . . Roderick Made answer, I am in the Moorish camp, And he who asketh is a Musselman. How then should I reply? ... Safely, rejoin'd The renegade, and freely may'st thou speak To all that Julian asks. Is not the yoke Of Mecca easy, and its burden light? ... Spain hath not found it so, the Goth replied, And groaning, turn'd away his countenance. Count Julian knit his brow, and stood awhile Regarding him with meditative eye In silence. Thou art honest too! he cried; Why 'twas in quest of such a man as this That the old Grecian search'd by lantern light In open day the city's crowded streets, So rare he deem'd the virtue. Honesty And sense of natural duty in a Priest! Now for a miracle, ye Saints of Spain! I shall not pry too closely for the wires, For, seeing what I see, ye have me now In the believing mood! O blessed Saints, Florinda cried, 'tis from the bitterness, Not from the hardness of the heart, he speaks! Hear him! and in your goodness give the scoff The virtue of a prayer! So saying, she raised Her hands in fervent action claspt to Heaven: Then as, still claspt, they fell, toward her sire She turn'd her eyes, beholding him through tears. The look, the gesture, and that silent woe, Soften'd her father's heart, which in this hour Was open to the influences of love. Priest, thy vocation were a blessed one, Said Julian, if its mighty power were used To lessen human misery, not to swell The mournful sum, already all-too-great. If, as thy former counsel should imply, Thou art not one who would for his craft's sake Fret with corrosives and inflame the wound, Which the poor sufferer brings to thee in trust That thou with virtuous balm wilt bind it up, .. If, as I think, thou art not one of those Whose villainy makes honest men turn Moors, Thou then wilt answer with unbiass'd mind What I shall ask thee, and exorcise thus The sick and feverish conscience of my child, From inbred phantoms, fiend-like, which possess Her innocent spirit. Children we are all Of one great Father, in whatever clime Nature or chance hath cast the seeds of life, All tongues, all colours: neither after death Shall we be sorted into languages And tints, . . white, black, and tawny, Greek and Goth, Northmen and offspring of hot Africa; The All-Father, He in whom we live and move, He the indifferent Judge of all, regards Nations, and hues, and dialects alike; According to their works shall they be judged, When even-handed Justice in the scale Their good and evil weighs. All creeds, I ween, Agree in this, and hold it orthodox. Roderick, perceiving here that Julian paused, As if he waited for acknowledgement Of that plain truth, in motion of assent Inclined his brow complacently, and said, Even so: What follows? . . This; resumed the Count, That creeds like colours being but accident, Are therefore in the scale imponderable; .. Thou seest my meaning; . . that from every faith As every clime, there is a way to Heaven, And thou and I may meet in Paradise. Oh grant it, God! cried Roderick fervently, And smote his breast. Oh grant it, gracious God! Through the dear blood of Jesus, grant that he And I may meet before the Mercy-throne! That were a triumph of Redeeming Love, For which admiring Angels would renew Their hallelujahs through the choir of Heaven! Man! quoth Count Julian, wherefore art thou moved To this strange passion? I require of thee Thy judgement, not thy prayers! Be not displeased! In gentle voice subdued the Goth replies; A prayer, from whatsoever lips it flow, By thine own rule should find the way to Heaven, So that the heart in its sincerity Straight forward breathe it forth. I, like thyself, Am all untrain'd to subtleties of speech, Nor competent of this great argument Thou openest; and perhaps shall answer thee Wide of the words, but to the purport home. There are to whom the light of gospel truth Hath never reach'd; of such I needs must deem As of the sons of men who had their day Before the light was given. But, Count, for those Who, born amid the light, to darkness turn, Wilful in error, ... I dare only say, God doth not leave the unhappy soul without An inward monitor, and till the grave Open, the gate of mercy is not closed. Priest-like! the renegade replied, and shook His head in scorn. What is not in the craft Is error, and for error there shall be No mercy found in Him whom yet ye name The Merciful! Now God forbid, rejoin'd The fallen King, that one who stands in nee Of mercy for his sins should argue thus Of error! Thou hast said that thou and I, Thou dying in name a Musselman, and I A servant of the Cross, may meet in Heaven. Time was when in our fathers' ways we walk'd Regardlessly alike; faith being to each, .. For so far thou hast reason'd rightly, . . like Our country's fashion and our mother-tongue, Of mere inheritance, . . no thing of choice In judgement fix'd, nor rooted in the heart. Me have the arrows of calamity Sore stricken; sinking underneath the weight Of sorrow, yet more heavily oppress'd Beneath the burthen of my sins, I turn'd In that dread hour to Him who from the Cross Calls to the heavy-laden. There I found Relief and comfort; there I have my hope, My strength and my salvation; there, the grave Ready beneath my feet, and Heaven in view, I to the King of Terrors say, Come, Death, .. Come quickly! Thou too wert a stricken deer, Julian, . . God pardon the unhappy hand That wounded thee! . . but whither didst thou go For healing? Thou hast turn'd away from Him, Who saith, Forgive as ye would be forgiven; And that the Moorish sword might do thy work, Received the creed of Mecca: with what fruit For Spain, let tell her cities sack'd, her sons Slaughter'd, her daughters than thine own dear child More foully wrong'd, more wretched! For thyself, Thou hast had thy fill of vengeance, and perhaps The cup was sweet: but it hath left behind A bitter relish! Gladly would thy soul Forget the past; as little canst thou bear To send into futurity thy thoughts: And for this Now, what is it, Count, but fear.. However bravely thou may'st bear thy front, .. Danger, remorse, and stinging obloquy? One only hope, one only remedy, One only refuge yet remains.... My life Is at thy mercy, Count! Call, if thou wilt, Thy men, and to the Moors deliver me! Or strike thyself! Death were from any hand A welcome gift; from thine, and in this cause, A boon indeed! My latest words on earth Should tell thee that all sins may be effaced, Bid thee repent, have faith, and be forgiven! Strike, Julian, if thou wilt, and send my soul To intercede for thine, that we may meet, Thou and thy child and I, beyond the grave. Thus Roderick spake, and spread his arms as if He offer'd to the sword his willing breast, With looks of passionate persuasion fix'd Upon the Count, who in his first access Of anger, seem'd as though he would have call'd His guards to seize the Priest. The attitude Disarm'd him, and that fervent zeal sincere, And more than both, the look and voice, which like A mystery troubled him. Florinda too Hung on his arm with both her hands, and cried, O father, wrong him not! he speaks from God! Life and salvation are upon his tongue! Judge thou the value of that faith whereby, Reflecting on the past, I murmur not, And to the end of all look on with joy Of hope assured! Peace, innocent! replied The Count, and from her hold withdrew his arm. Then with a gather'd brow of mournfulness Rather than wrath, regarding Roderick, said, Thou preachest that all sins may be effaced: Is there forgiveness, Christian. in thy creed For Roderick's crime? . . For Roderick and for thee, Count Julian, said the Goth, and as he spake Trembled through every fibre of his frame, The gate of Heaven is open. Julian threw His wrathful hand aloft, and cried, Away! Earth could not hold us both, nor can one Heaven Contain my deadliest enemy and me! My father, say not thus! Florinda cried; I have forgiven him! I have pray'd for him! For him, for thee, and for myself I pour One constant prayer to Heaven! In passion then She knelt, and bending back, with arms and face Raised toward the sky, the supplicant exclaim'd, Redeemer, heal his heart! It is the grief Which festers there that hath bewilder'd him! Save him, Redeemer! by thy precious death Save, save him, O my God! Then on her face She fell, and thus with bitterness pursued In silent throes her agonizing prayer. Afflict not thus thyself, my child, the Count Exclaim'd; O dearest, be thou comforted; Set but thy heart at rest, I ask no more! Peace dearest, peace! . . and weeping as he spake, He knelt to raise her. Roderick also knelt; Be comforted, he cried, and rest in faith That God will hear thy prayers! they must be heard. He who could doubt the worth of prayers like thine May doubt of all things! Sainted as thou art In sufferings here, this miracle will be Thy work and thy reward! Then raising her, They seated her upon the fountain's brink, And there beside her sate. The moon had risen, And that fair spring lay blackened half in shade, Half like a burnish'd mirror in her light. By that reflected light Count Julian saw That Roderick's face was bathed with tears, and pale As monumental marble. Friend, said he, Whether thy faith be fabulous, or sent Indeed from Heaven, its dearest gift to man, Thy heart is true: and had the mitred Priest Of Seville been like thee, or hadst thou held The place he fill'd; ... but this is idle talk, ... Things are as they will be; and we, poor slaves, Fret in the harness as we may, must drag The Car of Destiny where'er she drives, Inexorable and blind! Oh wretched man! Cried Roderick, if thou seekest to assuage Thy wounded spirit with that deadly drug, Hell's subtlest venom; look to thine own heart, Where thou hast Will and Conscience to belie This juggling sophistry, and lead thee yet Through penitence to Hearen! Whate'er it be That governs us, in mournful tone the Count Replied, Fate, Providence, or Allah's will, Or reckless Fortune, still the effect the same, A world of evil and of misery! Look where we will we meet it; wheresoe'er We go we bear it with us. Here we sit Upon the margin of this peaceful spring, And oh! what volumes of calamity Would be unfolded here, if either heart Laid open its sad records! Tell me not Of goodness! Either in some freak of power This frame of things was fashion'd, then cast off To take its own wild course, the sport of chance; Or the bad Spirit o'er the Good prevails, And in the eternal conflict hath arisen Lord of the ascendant! Rightly would'st thou say Were there no world but this! the Goth replied. The happiest child of earth that e'er was mark'd To be the minion of prosperity, Richest in corporal gifts and wealth of mind, Honour and fame attending him abroad, Peace and all dear domestic joys at home, And sunshine till the evening of his days Closed in without a cloud, . . even such a man Would from the gloom and horror of his heart Confirm thy fatal thought, were this world all, Oh! who could bear the haunting mystery, If death and retribution did not solve The riddle, and to heavenliest harmony Reduce the seeming chaos! ... Here we see The water at its well-head; clear it is, Not more transpicuous the invisible air; Pure as an infant's thoughts; and here to life And good directed all its uses serve. The herb grows greener on its brink; sweet flowers Bend o'er the stream that feeds their freshened roots; The red-breast loves it for his wintry haunts; And when the buds begin to open forth, Builds near it with his mate their brooding nest; The thirsty stag with widening nostrils there Invigorated draws his copious draught; And there amid its flags the wild-boar stands, Nor suffering wrong nor meditating hurt. Through woodlands wild and solitary fields Unsullied thus it holds its bounteous course; But when it reaches the resorts of men, The service of the city there defiles The tainted stream; corrupt and foul it flows Through loathsome banks and o'er a bed impure, Till in the sea, the appointed end to which Through all its way it hastens, 'tis received, And, losing all pollution, mingles there In the wide world of waters. So is it With the great stream of things, if all were seen; Good the beginning, good the end shall be, And transitory evil only make The good end happier. Ages pass away, Thrones fall, and nations disappear, and worlds Grow old and go to wreck; the soul alone Endures, and what she chuseth for herself, The arbiter of her own destiny, That only shall be permanent. But guilt, And all our suffering? said the Count. The Goth Replied, Repentance taketh sin away, Death remedies the rest.... Soothed by the strain Of such discourse, Julian was silent then, And sate contemplating. Florinda too Was calm'd: If sore experience may be thought To teach the uses of adversity, She said, alas! who better learn'd than I In that sad school! Methinks if ye would know How visitations of calamity Affect the pious soul, 'tis shown ye there! Look yonder at that cloud, which through the sky Sailing alone, doth cross in her career The rolling Moon! I watch'd it as it came, And deem'd the deep opake would blot her beams; But, melting like a wreath of snow, it hangs In folds of wavey silver round, and clothes The orb with richer beauties than her own, Then passing, leaves her in her light serene. Thus having said, the pious sufferer sate, Beholding with fix'd eyes that lovely orb, Till quiet tears confused in dizzy light The broken moonbeams. They too by the toil Of spirit, as by travail of the day Subdued, were silent, yielding to the hour. The silver cloud diffusing slowly past, And now into its airy elements Resolved is gone; while through the azure depth Alone in heaven the glorious Moon pursues Her course appointed, with indifferent beams Shining upon the silent hills around, And the dark tents of that unholy host, Who, all unconscious of impending fate, Take their last slumber there. The camp is still; The fires have mouldered, and the breeze which stirs The soft and snowy embers, just lays bare At times a red and evanescent light, Or for a moment wakes a feeble flame. They by the fountain hear the stream below, Whose murmurs, as the wind arose or fell, Fuller or fainter reach the ear attuned. And now the nightingale, not distant far, Began her solitary song; and pour'd To the cold moon a richer, stronger strain Than that with which the lyric lark salutes The new-born day. Her deep and thrilling song Seem'd with its piercing melody to reach The soul, and in mysterious unison Blend with all thoughts of gentleness and love. Their hearts were open to the healing power Of nature; and the splendour of the night, The flow of waters, and that sweetest lay Came to them like a copious evening dew Falling on vernal herbs which thirst for rain. XXII. THE MOORISH COUNCIL. Thus they beside the fountain sate, of food And rest forgetful, when a messenger Summon'd Count Julian to the Leader's tent. In council there at that late hour he found The assembled Chiefs, on sudden tidings call'd Of unexpected weight from Cordoba. Jealous that Abdalazis had assumed A regal state, affecting in his court The forms of Gothic sovereignty, the Moors, Whom artful spirits of ambitious mould Stirr'd up, had risen against him in revolt: And he who late had in the Caliph's name Ruled from the Ocean to the Pyrenees, A mutilate and headless carcase now, From pitying hands received beside the road A hasty grave, scarce hidden there from dogs And ravens, nor from wintry rains secure. She, too, who in the wreck of Spain preserved Her queenly rank, the wife of Roderick first, Of Abdalazis after, and to both Alike unhappy, shared the ruin now Her counsels had brought on; for she had led The infatuate Moor, in dangerous vauntery, To these aspiring forms, . . so should he gain Respect and honour from the Musselmen, She said, and that the obedience of the Goths Follow'd the sceptre. In an evil hour She gave the counsel, and in evil hour He lent a willing ear; the popular rage Fell on them both; and they to whom her name Had been a mark for mockery and reproach, Shudder'd with human horror at her fate. Ayub was heading the wild anarchy; But where the cement of authority Is wanting, all things there are dislocate: The mutinous soldiery, by every cry Of rumour set in wild career, were driven By every gust of passion, setting up One hour, what in the impulse of the next, Equally unreasoning, they destroy'd: thus all Was in misrule where uproar gave the law, And ere from far Damascus they could learn The Caliph's pleasure, many a moon must pass. What should be done? should Abulcacem march To Cordoba, and in the Caliph's name Assume the power which to his rank in arms Rightly devolved, restoring thus the reign Of order? or pursue with quicken'd speed The end of this great armament, and crush Rebellion first, then to domestic ills Apply his undivided mind and force Victorious? What in this emergency Was Julian's counsel, Abulcacem ask'd, Should they accomplish soon their enterprize? Or would the insurgent infidels prolong The contest, seeking by protracted war To weary them, and trusting in the strength Of these wild hills? Julian replied, The Chief Of this revolt is wary, resolute, Of approved worth in war: a desperate part He for himself deliberately hath chosen, Confiding in the hereditary love Borne to him by these hardy mountaineers, A love which his own noble qualities Have strengthen'd so that every heart is his. When ye can bring them to the open proof Of battle, ye will find them in his cause Lavish of life; but well they know the strength Of their own fastnesses, the mountain paths Impervious to pursuit, the vantages Of rock, and pass, and woodland, and ravine; And hardly will ye tempt them to forego These natural aids wherein they put their trust As in their stubborn spirit, each alike Deem'd by themselves invincible, and so By Roman found and Goth... beneath whose sway Slowly persuaded rather than subdued They came, and still through every change retain'd Their manners obstinate and barbarous speech. My counsel, therefore, is, that we secure With strong increase of force the adjacent posts, And chiefly Gegio, leaving them so mann'd As may abate the hope of enterprize Their strength being told. Time in a strife like this Becomes the ally of those who trust in him: Make then with Time your covenant. Old feuds May disunite the chiefs: some may be gain'd By fair entreaty, others by the stroke Of nature, or of policy, cut off. This was the counsel which in Cordoba I offer'd Abdalazis: in ill hour Rejecting it, he sent upon this war His father's faithful friend! Dark are the ways Of destiny! had I been at his side Old Muza would not now have mourn'd his age Left childless, nor had Ayub dared defy The Caliph's represented power. The case Calls for thine instant presence, with the weight Of thy legitimate authority. Julian said Orpas, turning from beneath His turban to the Count a crafty eye, Thy daughter is return'd; doth she not bring Some tidings of the movements of the foe? The Count replied, When child and parent meet First reconciled from discontents which wrung The hearts of both, ill should their converse be Of warlike matters! There hath been no time For such enquiries, neither should I think To ask her touching that for which I know She hath neither eye nor thought. There was a time, Orpas with smile malignant thus replied, When in the progress of the Caliph's arms Count Julian's daughter had an interest Which touch'd her nearly! But her turn is served, And hatred of Prince Orpas may beget Indifference to the cause. Yet Destiny Still guideth to the service of the faith The wayward heart of woman; for as one Delivered Roderick to the avenging sword, So hath another at this hour betray'd Pelayo to his fall. His sister came At nightfall to my tent a fugitive. She tells me that on learning our approach The rebel to a cavern in the hills Had sent his wife and children, and with them Those of his followers, thinking there conceal'd They might be safe. She, moved, by injuries Which stung her spirit, on the way escaped, And for revenge will guide us. In reward She asks her brother's forfeiture of lands In marriage with Numacian: something too Touching his life, that for her services It might be spared, she said; . . an after-thought To salve decorum, and if conscience wake Serve as a sop: but when the sword shall smite Pelayo and his dangerous race, I ween That a thin kerchief will dry all the tears The Lady Guisla sheds! 'Tis the old taint! Said Julian mournfully; from her mother's womb She brought the inbred wickedness which now In ripe infection blossoms. Woman, woman, Still to the Goths art thou the instrument Of overthrow; thy virtue and thy vice Fatal alike to them! Say rather, cried The insidious renegade, that Allah thus By woman punisheth the idolatry Of those who raise a woman to the rank Of godhead, calling on their Mary's name With senseless prayers. In vain shall they invoke Her trusted succour now! like silly birds By fear betray'd, they fly into the toils; And this Pelayo, who in lengthen'd war Baffling our force, has thought perhaps to reign Prince of the Mountains, when we hold his wife And offspring at our mercy, must himself Come to the lure. Enough, the Leader said; This unexpected work of favouring Fate Opens an easy way to our desires, And renders farther counsel needless now. Great is the Prophet whose protecting power Goes with the faithful forth! the rebels' days Are number'd; Allah hath deliver'd them Into our hands! So saying he arose; The Chiefs withdrew, Orpas alone remain'd Obedient to his indicated will. The event, said Abulcacem, hath approved Thy judgement in all points; his daughter comes At the first summons, even as thou saidst; Her errand with the insurgents done, she brings Their well-concerted project back, a safe And unexpected messenger; . . the Moor, .. The shallow Moor, . . must see and not perceive; Must hear and understand not; yea must bear, Poor easy fool, to serve their after mirth, A part in his own undoing! But just Heaven With this unlook'd-for incident hath marr'd Their complots, and the sword shall cut this web Of treason. Well, the renegade replied, Thou knowest Count Julian's spirit, quick in wiles, In act audacious. Baffled now, he thinks Either by instant warning to apprize The rebels of their danger, or preserve The hostages when fallen into our power, Till secret craft contrive, or open force Win their enlargement. Haply too he dreams Of Cordoba, the avenger and the friend Of Abdalazis, in that cause to arm Moor against Moor, preparing for himself The victory o'er the enfeebled conquerors. Success in treason hath embolden'd him, And power but serves him for fresh treachery, false To Roderick first, and to the Caliph now. The guilt, said Abulcacem, is confirm'd, The sentence past; all that is now required Is to strike sure and safely. He hath with him A veteran force devoted to his will, Whom to provoke were perilous; nor less Of peril lies there in delay: what course Between these equal dangers should we steer? They have been train'd beneath him in the wars Of Africa, the renegade replied; Men are they who, from their youth up, have found Their occupation and their joy in arms; Indifferent to the cause for which they fight, But faithful to their leader, who hath won By licence largely given, yet temper'd still With exercise of firm authority, Their whole devotion. Vainly should we seek By proof of Julian's guilt to pacify Such martial spirits, unto whom all creeds And countries are alike; but take away The head, and forthwith their fidelity Goes at the market price. The act must be Sudden and secret; poison is too slow. Thus it may best be done; the Mountaineers, Doubtless, ere long will rouse us with some spur Of sudden enterprise: at such a time A trusty minister approaching him May smite him, so that all shall think the spear Comes from the hostile troops. Right counsellor! Cried Abulcacem, thou shalt have his lands, The proper meed of thy fidelity: His daughter thou may'st take or leave. Go now And find a faithful instrument to put Our purpose in effect! ... And when 'tis done, The Moor, as Orpas from the tent withdrew, Muttering pursued, . . look for a like reward Thyself! that restless head of wickedness In the grave will brood no treasons. Other babes Scream when the Devil, as they spring to life, Infects them with his touch; but thou didst stretch Thine arms to meet him, and like mother's milk Suck the congenial evil! Thou hast tried Both laws, and were there aught to gain, wouldst prove A third as readily; but when thy sins Are weigh'd, 'twill be against an empty scale, And neither Prophet will avail thee then! XXIII. THE VALE OF COVADONGA. The camp is stirring, and ere day hath dawn'd The tents are struck. Early they rise whom hope Awakens, and they travel fast with whom She goes companion of the way. By noon Hath Abulcacem in his speed attain'd The vale of Cangas. Well the trusty scouts Observe his march, and fleet as mountain roes, From post to post with instantaneous speed The warning bear: none else is night; the vale Hath been deserted, and Pelayo's hall Is open to the foe, who on the tower Hoist their white signal-flag. In Sella's stream The misbelieving multitudes perform, With hot and hasty hand, their noontide rite, Then hurryingly repeat the Impostor's prayer. Here they divide; the Chieftain halts with half The host, retaining Julian and his men, Whom where the valley widen'd he disposed, Liable to first attack, that so the deed Of murder plann'd with Orpas might be done. The other force the Moor Alcahman led, Whom Guisla guided up Pionia's stream Eastward to Soto. Ibrahim went with him, Proud of Granada's snowy heights subdued, And boasting of his skill in mountain war; Yet sure he deem'd an easier victory Awaited him this day. Little, quoth he, Weens the vain Mountaineer who puts his trust In dens and rocky fastnesses, how close Destruction is at hand! Belike he thinks The Humma's happy wings have shadow'd him, And therefore Fate with royalty must crown His chosen head! Pity the scymitar With its rude edge so soon should interrupt The pleasant dream! There can be no escape For those who in the cave seek shelter, cried Alcahman; yield they must, or from their holes Like bees we smoke them out. The Chief perhaps May reign awhile King of the wolves and bears, Till his own subjects hunt him down, or kites And crows divide what hunger may have left Upon his ghastly limbs. Happier for him That destiny should this day to our hands Deliver him; short would be his sufferings then; And we right joyfully should in one hour Behold our work accomplish'd, and his race Extinct. Thus these in mockery and in thoughts Of bloody triumph, to the future blind, Indulged the scornful vein; nor deem'd that they Whom to the sword's unsparing edge they doom'd, Even then in joyful expectation pray'd To Heaven for their approach, and at their post Prepared, were trembling with excess of hope. Here in these mountain straits the Mountaineer Had felt his country's strength insuperable; Here he had pray'd to see the Musselman With all his myriads; therefore had he look'd To Covadonga as a sanctuary Apt for concealment, easy of defence; And Guisla's flight, though to his heart it sent A pang more poignant for their mother's sake, Yet did it further in its consequence His hope and project, surer than decoy Well-laid, or best-concerted stratagem. That sullen and revengeful mind, he knew, Would follow to the extremity of guilt Its long fore-purposed shame: the toils were laid, And she who by the Musselmen full sure Thought on her kindred her revenge to wreak, Led the Moors in. Count Pedro and his son Were hovering with the main Asturian force In the wider vale to watch occasion there, And with hot onset when the alarm began Pursue the vantage. In the fated straits Of Deva had the King disposed the rest: Amid the hanging woods, and on the cliffs, A long mile's length on either side its bed, They lay. The lever and the axe and saw Had skilfully been plied; and trees and stones, A dread artillery, ranged on crag and shelf And steep descent, were ready at the word Precipitate to roll resistless down. The faithful maiden not more wistfully Looks for the day that brings her lover home; . Scarce more impatiently the horse endures The rein, when loud and shrill the hunter's horn Rings in his joyous ears, than at their post The Mountaineers await their certain prey; Yet mindful of their Prince's order, oft And solemnly enforced, with eagerness Subdued by minds well-master'd, they expect The appointed signal. Hand must not be raised, Foot stirr'd, nor voice be utter'd, said the Chief, Till the word pass: impatience would mar all. God hath deliver'd over to your hands His enemies and ours, so we but use The occasion wisely. Not till the word pass From man to man transmitted, “In the name “Of God, for Spain and Vengeance!” let a hand Be lifted; on obedience all depends, Their march below with noise of horse and foot And haply with the clang of instruments, Might drown all other signal, this is sure; But wait it calmly; it will not be given Till the whole line hath enter'd in the toils. Comrades, be patient, so shall none escape Who once set foot within these straits of death. Thus had Pelayo on the Mountaineers With frequent and impressive charge enforced The needful exhortation. This alone He doubted, that the Musselmen might see The perils of the vale, and warily Forbear to enter. But they thought to find, As Guisla told, the main Asturian force Seeking concealment there, no other aid Soliciting from these their native hills; And that the babes and women having fallen In thraldom, they would lay their weapons down And supplicate forgiveness for their sake. Nor did the Moors perceive in what a strait They enter'd; for the morn had risen o'ercast, And when the Sun had reach'd the height of heaven, Dimly his pale and beamless orb was seen Moving through mist. A soft and gentle rain, Scarce heavier than the summer's evening dew, Descended, . . through so still an atmosphere, That every leaf upon the moveless trees Was studded o'er with rain-drops, bright and full, None falling till from its own weight o'erswoln The motion came. Low on the mountain side The fleecey vapour hung, and in its veil With all their dreadful preparations wrapt The Mountaineers; . . in breathless hope they lay, Some blessing God in silence for the power This day vouchsafed; others with fervency Of prayer and vow invoked the Mother-Maid, Beseeching her that in this favouring hour She would be strongly with them. From below Meantime distinct they heard the passing tramp Of horse and foot, continuous as the sound Of Deva's stream, and barbarous tongues commixt With laughter, and with frequent shouts, . . for all Exultant came, expecting sure success; Blind wretches, over whom the ruin hung! They say, quoth one, that though the Prophet's soul Doth with the black-eyed Houris bathe in bliss, Life hath not left his body, which bears up By its miraculous power the holy tomb, And holds it at Medina in the air Buoyant between the temple's floor and roof: And there the Angels fly to him with news From East, West, North, and South, of what befalls His faithful people. If when he shall hear The tale of this day's work, he should for joy Forget that he is dead, and walk abroad, .. It were as good a miracle as when He sliced the moon! Sir Angel hear me now, Whoe'er thou be'st who art about to speed From Spain to Araby! when thou hast got The Prophet's ear, be sure thou tellest him How bravely Ghauleb did his part to-day, And with what special reverence he alone Desired thee to commend him to his grace! .. Fie on thee, scoffer that thou art! replied His comrade; thou wilt never leave these gibes Till some commission'd arrow through the teeth Shall nail the offending tongue. Hast thou not heard How when our clay is leaven'd first with life, The ministering Angel brings it from that spot Whereon 'tis written in the eternal book That soul and body must their parting take, And earth to earth return? How knowest thou But that the Spirit who compounded thee, To distant Syria from this very vale Bore thy component dust, and Azrael here Awaits thee at this hour? . . Little thought he Who spake, that in that valley at that hour One death awaited both! Thus they pursued Toward the cave their inauspicious way. Weak childhood there and ineffective age In the chambers of the rock were placed secure; But of the women, all whom with the babes Maternal care detain'd not, were aloft To aid in the destruction; by the side Of fathers, brethren, husbands, station'd there They watch and pray. Pelayo in the cave With the venerable primate took his post. Ranged on the rising cliffs on either hand, Vigilant sentinels with eye intent Observe his movements, when to take the word And pass it forward. He in arms complete Stands in the portal: a stern majesty Reign'd in his countenance severe that hour, And in his eye a deep and dreadful joy Shone, as advancing up the vale he saw The Moorish banners. God hath blinded them! He said; the measure of their crimes is full! O Vale of Deva, famous shalt thou be From this day forth for ever; and to these Thy springs shall unborn generations come In pilgrimage, and hallow with their prayers The cradle of their native monarchy! There was a stirring in the air, the sun Prevail'd, and gradually the brightening mist Began to rise and melt. A jutting crag Upon the right projected o'er the stream, Not farther from the cave than a strong hand Expert, with deadly aim, might cast the spear, Or a strong voice, pitch'd to full compass, make Its clear articulation heard distinct. A venturous dalesman, once ascending there To rob the eagle's nest, had fallen, and hung Among the heather, wonderously preserved: Therefore had he with pious gratitude Placed on that overhanging brow a Cross, Tall as the mast of some light fisher's skiff, And from the vale conspicuous. As the Moors Advanced, the Chieftain in the van was seen Known by his arms, and from the crag a voice Pronounced his name, .... alcahman! hoa, look up, Alcahman! As the floating mist drew up, It had divided there, and open'd round The Cross; part clinging to the rock beneath, Hovering and waving part in fleecey folds, A canopy of silver light condensed To shape and substance. In the midst there stood A female form, one hand upon the Cross, The other raised in menacing act; below Loose flow'd her raiment, but her breast was arm'd, And helmeted her head. The Moor turn'd pale, For on the walls of Auria he had seen That well-known figure, and had well believed She rested with the dead. What, hoa! she cried, Alcahman! In the name of all who fell At Auria in the massacre, this hour I summon thee before the throne of God To answer for the innocent blood! This hour, Moor, Miscreant, Murderer, Child of Hell, this hour I summon thee to judgement! ... In the name Of God! for Spain and Vengeance! Thus she closed Her speech; for taking from the Primate's hand That oaken cross which at the sacring rites Had served for crosier, at the cavern's mouth Pelayo lifted it and gave the word. From voice to voice on either side it pass'd With rapid repetition, . . In the name Of God! for Spain and Vengeance! and forthwith On either side along the whole defile The Asturians shouting in the name of God, Set the whole ruin loose! huge trunks and stones, And loosen'd crags, down down they roll'd with rush And bound, and thundering force. Such was the fall As when some city by the labouring earth Heaved from its strong foundations is cast down, And all its dwellings, towers, and palaces, In one wide desolation prostrated. From end to end of that long strait, the crash Was heard continuous, and commixt with sounds More dreadful, shrieks of horror and despair, And death, . . the wild and agonizing cry Of that whole host in one destruction whelm'd. Vain was all valour there, all martial skill; The valiant arm is helpless now; the feet Swift in the race avail not now to save; They perish, all their thousands perish there, .. Horsemen and infantry they perish all, .. The outward armour and the bones within Broken and bruised and crush'd. Echo prolong'd The long uproar: a silence then ensued, Through which the sound of Deva's stream was heard, A lonely voice of waters, wild and sweet; The lingering groan, the faintly-utter'd prayer, The louder curses of despairing death, Ascended not so high. Down from the cave Pelayo hastes, the Asturians hasten down, Fierce and immitigable down they speed On all sides, and along the vale of blood The avenging sword did mercy's work that hour. XXIV. RODERICK AND COUNT JULIAN. Thou hast been busy, Death! this day, and yet But half thy work is done; the Gates of Hell Are throng'd, yet twice ten thousand spirits more, Who from their warm and healthful tenements Fear no divorce, must ere the sun go down Enter the world of woe! the Gate of Heaven Is open too, and Angels round the throne Of Mercy on their golden harps this day Shall sing the triumphs of Redeeming Love. There was a Church at Cangas dedicate To that Apostle unto whom his Lord Had given the keys; a humble edifice, Whose rude and time-worn structure suited well That vale among the mountains. Its low roof With stone plants and with moss was overgrown, Short fern, and richer weeds which from the eaves Hung their long tresses down. White lichens clothed The sides, save where the ivy spread, which bower'd The porch, and clustering round the pointed wall, Wherein two bells, each open to the wind, Hung side by side, threaded with hairy shoots The double nich; and climbing to the cross, Wreathed it and half conceal'd its sacred form With bushy tufts luxuriant. Here in the font, .. Borne hither with rejoicing and with prayers Of all the happy land who saw in him The lineage of their ancient Chiefs renew'd, .. The Prince had been immersed: and here within An oaken galilee, now black with age, His old Iberian ancestors were laid. Two stately oaks stood nigh, in the full growth Of many a century. They had flourish'd there Before the Gothic sword was felt in Spain, And when the ancient sceptre of the Goths Was broken, there they flourish'd still. Their boughs Mingled on high, and stretching wide around, Form'd a deep shade, beneath which canopy Upon the ground Count Julian's board was spread, For to his daughter he had left his tent Pitch'd for her use hard by. He at the board Sate with his trusted Captains, Gunderick, Felix and Miro, Theudered and Paul, Basil and Cottila, and Virimar, Men through all fortunes faithful to their Lord, And to that old and tried fidelity, By personal love and honour held in ties Strong as religious bonds. As there they sate, In the distant vale a rising dust was seen, And frequent flash of steel, . . the flying fight Of men who, by a fiery foe pursued, Put forth their coursers at full speed, to reach The aid in which they trust. Up sprung the Chiefs, And hastily taking helm and shield, and spear, Sped to their post. Amid the chesnut groves On Sella's side, Alphonso had in charge To watch the foe; a prowling band came nigh, Whom with the ardour of impetuous youth He charged and followed them in close pursuit: Quick succours join'd them; and the strife grew hot, Ere Pedro hastening to bring off his son, Or Julian and his Captains, . . bent alike That hour to abstain from combat, (for by this Full sure they deem'd Alcahman had secured The easy means of certain victory,) .. Could reach the spot. Both thus in their intent According, somewhat had they now allay'd The fury of the fight, though still spears flew, And strokes of sword and mace were interchanged, When passing through the troop a Moor came up On errand from the Chief, to Julian sent; A fatal errand fatally perform'd For Julian, for the Chief, and for himself, And all that host of Musselmen he brought; For while with well-dissembled words he lured The warrior's ear, the dexterous ruffian mark'd The favouring moment and unguarded place, And plunged a javelin in his side. The Count, Fell, but in falling called to Cottila, Treachery! the Moor! the Moor! . . He too on whom He call'd had seen the blow from whence it came, And seized the murderer. Miscreant! he exclaim'd, Who set thee on? The Musselman, who saw His secret purpose baffled, undismayed, Replies, What I have done is authorized; To punish treachery and prevent worse ill Orpas and Abulcacem sent me here; The service of the Caliph and the Faith Required the blow. The Prophet and the Fiend Reward thee then! cried Cottila; meantime Take thou from me thy proper earthly meed; Villain! . . and lifting as he spake the sword, He smote him on the neck: the trenchant blade Through vein and artery pass'd and yielding bone; And on the shoulder, as the assassin dropt, His head half-severed fell. The curse of God Fall on the Caliph and the Faith and thee! Stamping for anguish, Cottila pursued; African dogs, thus is it ye requite Our services? . . But dearly shall ye pay For this day's work! . . O Fellow-soldiers, here, Stretching his hands toward the host, he cried, Behold your noble leader basely slain! He who for twenty years hath led us forth To war, and brought us home with victory, Here he lies foully murdered, . . by the Moors, .. Those whom he trusted, whom he served so well! Our turn is next! but neither will we wait Idly, nor tamely fall! Amid the grief, Tumult, and rage, of those who gather'd round, When Julian could be heard, I have yet life, He said, for vengeance. Virimar, speed thou To yonder Mountaineers, and tell their Chiefs That Julian's veteran army joins this day Pelayo's standard! The command devolves On Gunderick. Fellow-soldiers, who so well Redress'd the wrongs of your old General, Ye will not let his death go unrevenged! .. Tears then were seen on many an iron cheek, And groans were heard from many a resolute heart, And vows with imprecations mix'd went forth, And curses check'd by sobs. Bear me apart, Said Julian, with a faint and painful voice, And let me see my daughter ere I die. Scarce had he spoken when the pitying throng Divide before her. Eagerly she came; A deep and fearful lustre in her eye, A look of settled woe, . . pale, deadly pale, Yet to no lamentations giving way, Nor tears nor groans; . . within her breaking heart She bore the grief, and kneeling solemnly Beside him, raised her aweful hands to heaven, And cried, Lord God! be with him in this hour! Two things have I to think of, O my child, Vengeance and thee; said Julian. For the first I have provided: what remains of life As best may comfort thee may so be best Employ'd; let me be borne within the church, And thou, with that good man who follows thee, Attend me there. Thus when Florinda heard Her father speak, a gleam of heavenly joy Shone through the anguish of her countenance. O gracious God, she cried, my prayers are heard; Now let me die! . . They raised him from the earth; He, knitting as they lifted him his brow, Drew in through open lips and teeth firm-closed His painful breath, and on the lance laid hand, Lest its long shaft should shake the mortal wound. Gently his men with slow and steady step Their suffering burthen bore, and in the Church Before the altar laid him down, his head Upon Florinda's knees.... Now, friends, said he, Farewell. I ever hoped to meet my death Among ye, like a soldier, . . but not thus! Go join the Asturians; and in after years, When of your old commander ye shall talk, How well he loved his followers, what he was In battle, and how basely he was slain, Let not the tale its fit completion lack, But say how bravely was his death revenged. Vengeance! in that good word doth Julian make His testament; your faithful swords must give The will its full performance. Leave me now, I have done with worldly things. Comrades, farewell; And love my memory! They with copious tears Of burning anger, grief exasperating Their rage, and fury giving force to grief, Hasten'd to form their ranks against the Moors. Julian meantime toward the altar turn'd His languid eyes: That Image, is it not St. Peter, he inquired, he who denied His Lord and was forgiven? . . Roderick rejoin'd, It is the Apostle; and may that same Lord, O Julian, to thy soul's salvation bless The seasonable thought! The dying Count Then fix'd upon the Goth his earnest eyes. No time, said he, is this for bravery, As little for dissemblance. I would fain Die in the faith wherein my fathers died, Whereto they pledged me in mine infancy... A soldier's habits, he pursued, have steel'd My spirit, and perhaps I do not fear This passage as I ought. But if to feel That I have sinn'd, and from my soul renounce The Impostor's faith, which never in that soul Obtain'd a place, . . if at the Saviour's feet, Laden with guilt, to cast myself and cry, Lord, I believe! help thou my unbelief! .. If this in the sincerity of death Sufficeth, . . Father, let me from thy lips Receive the assurances with which the Church Doth bless the dying Christian. Roderick raised His eyes to Heaven, and crossing on his breast His open palms, Mysterious are thy ways And merciful, O gracious Lord! he cried, Who to this end hast thus been pleased to lead My wandering steps! O Father, this thy son Hath sinn'd and gone astray: but hast not Thou Said, When the sinner from his evil ways Turneth, that he shall save his soul alive, And Angels at the sight rejoice in Heaven? Therefore do I, in thy most holy name, Into thy family receive again Him who was lost, and in that name absolve The Penitent.... So saying on the head Of Julian solemnly he laid his hands. Then to the altar tremblingly he turn'd, And took the bread, and breaking it, pursued, Julian! receive from me the Bread of Life! In silence reverently the Count partook The reconciling rite, and to his lips Roderick then held the consecrated cup. Me too! exclaim'd Florinda, who till then Had listen'd speechlessly; Thou Man of God, I also must partake! The Lord hath heard My prayers! one sacrament, . . one hour, . . one grave, .. One resurrection! That dread office done, Count Julian with amazement saw the Priest Kneel down before him. By the sacrament Which we have here partaken, Roderick cried, In this most aweful moment; by that hope, .. That holy faith which comforts thee in death, Grant thy forgiveness, Julian, ere thou diest! Behold the man who most hath injured thee! Roderick, the wretched Goth, the guilty cause Of all thy guilt, . . the unworthy instrument Of thy redemption, . . kneels before thee here, And prays to be forgiven! Roderick! exclaim'd The dying Count, . . Roderick! . . and from the floor With violent effort half he raised himself; The spear hung heavy in his side, and pain And weakness overcame him, that he fell Back on his daughter's lap. O Death, cried he, .. Passing his hand across his cold damp brow, .. Thou tamest the strong limb, and conquerest The stubborn heart! But yesterday I said One Heaven could not contain mine enemy And me: and now I lift my dying voice To say, Forgive me, Lord, as I forgive Him who hath done the wrong! . . He closed his eyes A moment; then with sudden impulse cried, .. Roderick, thy wife is dead, . . the Church hath power To free thee from thy vows, . . the broken heart Might yet be heal'd, the wrong redress'd, the throne Rebuilt by that same hand which pull'd it down, And these cursed Africans... Oh for a month Of that waste life which millions misbestow! .. His voice was passionate, and in his eye With glowing animation while he spake The vehement spirit shone: its effort soon Was past, and painfully with feeble breath In slow and difficult utterance he pursued, .. Vain hope, if all the evil was ordain'd, And this wide wreck the will and work of Heaven, We but the poor occasion! Death will make All clear, and joining us in better worlds, Complete our union there! Do for me now One friendly office more: . . draw forth the spear, And free me from this pain! ... Receive his soul, Saviour! exclaim'd the Goth, as he perform'd The fatal service. Julian cried, O friend! .. True friend! . . and gave to him his dying hand. Then said he to Florinda, I go first, Thou followest! . . kiss me, child! . . and now good night! When from her father's body she arose, Her cheek was flush'd, and in her eyes there beam'd A wilder brightness. On the Goth she gazed While underneath the emotions of that hour Exhausted life gave way. O God! she said, Lifting her hands, thou hast restored me all, .. All.. in one hour! . . and round his neck she threw Her arms and cried, My Roderick! mine in Heaven! Groaning, he claspt her close, and in that act And agony her happy spirit fled. XXV. RODERICK IN BATTLE. Eight thousand men had to Asturias march'd Beneath Count Julian's banner; the remains Of that brave army which in Africa So well against the Musselman made head, Till sense of injuries insupportable, And raging thirst of vengeance, overthrew Their leader's noble spirit. To revenge His quarrel, twice that number left their bones, Slain in unnatural battle, on the field Of Xeres, when the sceptre from the Goths By righteous Heaven was reft. Others had fallen Consumed in sieges, alway by the Moor To the front of war opposed. The policy, With whatsoever show of honour cloak'd, Was gross, and this surviving band had oft At their carousals, of the flagrant wrong, Held such discourse as stirs the mounting blood, The common danger with one discontent Affecting chiefs and men. Nor had the bonds Of rooted discipline and faith attach'd, Thus long restrain'd them, had they not known well That Julian in their just resentment shared, And fix'd their hopes on him. Slight impulse now Sufficed to make these fiery martialists Break forth in open fury; and though first Count Pedro listen'd with suspicious ear To Julian's dying errand, deeming it Some new decoy of treason, . . when he found A second legate follow'd Virimar, And then a third, and saw the turbulence Of the camp, and how against the Moors in haste They form'd their lines, he knew that Providence This hour had for his country interposed, And in such faith advanced to use the aid Thus wondrously ordain'd. The eager Chiefs Hasten to greet him, Cottila and Paul, Basil and Miro, Theudered, Gunderick, Felix, and all who held authority; The zealous services of their brave host They proffer'd, and besought him instantly To lead against the African their force Combined, and in good hour assail a foe Divided, nor for such attack prepared. While thus they communed, Roderick from the church Came forth, and seeing Pedro, bent his way Toward them. Sirs, said he, the Count is dead; He died a Christian, reconciled to Heaven, In faith; and when his daughter had received His dying breath, her spirit too took flight. One sacrament, one death, united them; And I beseech ye, ye who from the work Of blood which lies before us may return, .. If, as I think, it should not be my fate.. That in one grave with Christian ceremonies Ye lay them side by side. In Heaven I ween They are met through mercy: . . ill befall the man Who should in death divide them! . . Then he turn'd His speech to Pedro in an under voice; The King, said he, I know with noble mind Will judge of the departed; Christian-like He died, and with a manly penitence: They who condemn him most should call to mind How grievous was the wrong which madden'd him; Be that remember'd in his history, And let no shame be offer'd his remains. As Pedro would have answer'd, a loud cry Of menacing imprecation from the troops Arose; for Orpas, by the Moorish Chief Sent to allay the storm his villainy Had stirr'd, came hastening on a milk-white steed, And at safe distance having check'd the rein, Beckon'd for parley. 'Twas Orelio On which he rode, Roderick's own battle-horse, Who from his master's hand had wont to feed, And with a glad docility obey His voice familiar. At the sight the Goth Started, and indignation to his soul Brought back the thoughts and feelings of old times. Suffer me, Count, he cried, to answer him, And hold these back the while! Thus having said, He waited no reply, but as he was, Bareheaded, in his weeds, and all unarm'd, Advanced toward the renegade. Sir Priest, Quoth Orpas as he came, I hold no talk With thee; my errand is with Gunderick And the Captains of the host, to whom I bring Such liberal offers and clear proof... The Goth, Breaking with scornful voice his speech, exclaim'd, What, could no steed but Roderick's serve thy turn? I should have thought some sleek and sober mule Long train'd in shackles to procession pace, More suited to my lord of Seville's use Than this good war-horse, . . he who never bore A villain, until Orpas cross'd his back! ... Wretch! cried the astonish'd renegade, and stoopt, Foaming with anger, from the saddle-bow To reach his weapon. Ere the hasty hand Trembling in passion could perform its will, Roderick had seized the reins. How now, he cried, Orelio! old companion, . . my good horse, .. Off with this recreant burthen! ... And with that He raised his hand, and rear'd and back'd the steed, To that remember'd voice and arm of power Obedient. Down the helpless traitor fell Violently thrown, and Roderick over him Thrice led with just and unrelenting hand The trampling hoofs. Go join Witiza now, Where he lies howling, the avenger cried, And tell him Roderick sent thee! At that sight, Count Julian's soldiers and the Asturian host Set up a shout, a joyful shout, which rung Wide through the welkin. Their exulting cry With louder acclamation was renew'd, When from the expiring miscreant's neck they saw That Roderick took the shield, and round his own Hung it, and vaulted in the seat. My horse! My noble horse! he cried, with flattering hand Patting his high-arch'd neck! the renegade, I thank him for't, hath kept thee daintily! Orelio, thou art in thy beauty still, Thy pride and strength! Orelio, my good horse, Once more thou bearest to the field thy Lord, He who so oft hath fed and cherish'd thee, He for whose sake, wherever thou wert seen, Thou wert by all men honour'd. Once again Thou hast thy proper master! Do thy part As thou wert wont; and bear him gloriously, My beautiful Orelio, . . to the last... The happiest of his fields! ... Then he drew forth The scymitar, and waving it aloft, Rode toward the troops; its unaccustom'd shape Disliked him; Renegade in all things! cried The Goth, and cast it from him; to the Chiefs Then said, If I have done ye service here, Help me, I pray you, to a Spanish sword! The trustiest blade that e'er in Bilbilis Was dipt, would not to-day be misbestowed On this right hand! . . Go some one, Gunderick cried, And bring Count Julian's sword. Whoe'er thou art, The worth which thou hast shown avenging him Entitles thee to wear it. But thou goest For battle unequipp'd; . . haste there and strip Yon villain of his armour! Late he spake, So fast the Moors came on. It matters not, Replied the Goth; there's many a mountaineer, Who in no better armour cased this day Than his wonted leathern gipion, will be found In the hottest battle, yet bring off untouch'd The unguarded life he ventures... Taking then Count Julian's sword, he fitted round his wrist The chain, and eyeing the elaborate steel With stern regard of joy, The African Under unhappy stars was born, he cried, Who tastes thy edge! . . Make ready for the charge! They come.. they come! . . On, brethren, to the field! .. The word is Vengeance! Vengeance was the word; From man to man, and rank to rank it pass'd, By every heart enforced, by every voice Sent forth in loud defiance of the foe. The enemy in shriller sounds return'd Their Akbar and the Prophet's trusted name. The horsemen lower'd their spears, the infantry Deliberately with slow and steady step Advanced; the bow-strings twang'd, and arrows hiss'd, And javelins hurtled by. Anon the hosts Met in the shock of battle, horse and man Conflicting; shield struck shield, and sword and mace And curtle-axe on helm and buckler rung; Armour was riven, and wounds were interchanged, And many a spirit from its mortal hold Hurried to bliss or bale. Well did the Chiefs Of Julian's army in that hour support Their old esteem; and well Count Pedro there Enhanced his former praise; and by his side, Rejoicing like a bridegroom in the strife, Alphonso through the host of infidels Bore on his bloody lance dismay and death. But there was worst confusion and uproar, There widest slaughter and dismay, where, proud Of his recover'd Lord, Orelio plunged Through thickest ranks, trampling beneath his feet The living and the dead. Where'er he turns The Moors divide and fly. What man is this, Appall'd they say, who to the front of war Bareheaded offers thus his naked life? Replete with power he is, and terrible, Like some destroying Angel! Sure his lips Have drank of Kaf's dark fountain, and he comes Strong in his immortality! Fly! fly! They said, this is no human foe! . . Nor less Of wonder fill'd the Spaniards when they saw How flight and terror went before his way, And slaughter in his path. Behold, cries one, With what command and knightly ease he sits The intrepid steed, and deals from side to side His dreadful blows! Not Roderick in his power Bestrode with such command and majesty That noble war-horse. His loose robe this day Is death's black banner, shaking from its folds Dismay and ruin. Of no mortal mould Is he who in that garb of peace affronts Whole hosts, and sees them scatter where he turns! Auspicious Heaven beholds us, and some Saint Revisits earth! Aye, cries another, Heaven Hath ever with especial bounty blest Above all other lands its favour'd Spain; Chusing her children forth from all mankind For its peculiar people, as of yore Abraham's ungrateful race beneath the Law. Who knows not how on that most holy night When peace on Earth by Angels was proclaim'd, The light which o'er the fields of Bethlehem shone, Irradiated whole Spain? not just display'd, As to the Shepherds, and again withdrawn; All the long winter hours from eve till morn Her forests and her mountains and her plains, Her hills and valleys were embathed in light, A light which came not from the sun or moon Or stars, by secondary powers dispensed, But from the fountain-springs, the Light of Light Effluent. And wherefore should we not believe That this may be some Saint or Angel, charged To lead us to miraculous victory? Hath not the Virgin Mother oftentimes Descending, clothed in glory, sanctified With feet adorable our happy soil? ... Mark'd ye not, said another, how he cast In wrath the unhallow'd scymitar away, And called for Christian weapon? Oh be sure This is the aid of Heaven! On, comrades, on! A miracle to-day is wrought for Spain! Victory and Vengeance! Hew the miscreants down, And spare not! hew them down in sacrifice! God is with us! his Saints are in the field! Victory! miraculous Victory! Thus they Inflamed with wild belief the keen desire Of vengeance on their enemies abhorr'd, The Moorish chief, meantime, o'erlooked the fight From an eminence, and cursed the renegade Whose counsels sorting to such ill effect Had brought this danger on. Lo, from the East Comes fresh alarm! a few poor fugitives Well-nigh with fear exanimate came up, From Covadonga flying, and the rear Of that destruction, scarce with breath to tell Their dreadful tale. When Abulcacem heard, Stricken with horror, like a man bereft Of sense, he stood. O Prophet, he exclaim'd, A hard and cruel fortune hast thou brought This day upon thy servant! Must I then Here with disgrace and ruin close a life Of glorious deeds? But how should man resist Fate's irreversible decrees, or why Murmur at what must be? They who survive May mourn the evil which this day begins: My part will soon be done! ... Grief then gave way To rage, and cursing Guisla, he pursued, Oh that that treacherous woman were but here! It were a consolation to give her The evil death she merits! That reward She hath had, a Moor replied. For when we reach'd The entrance of the vale, it was her choice There in the farthest dwellings to be left, Lest she should see her brother's face; but thence We found her flying at the overthrow, And visiting the treason on her head, Pierced her with wounds... Poor vengeance for a host Destroyed! said Abulcacem in his soul. Howbeit, resolving to the last to do His office, he roused up his spirit. Go, Strike off Count Eudon's head! he cried; the fear Which brought him to our camp will bring him else In arms against us now; For Sisibert And Ebba, he continued thus in thought, Their uncle's fate for ever bars all plots Of treason on their part; no hope have they Of safety but with us. He call'd them then With chosen troops to join him in the front Of battle, that by bravely making head, Retreat might now be won. Then fiercer raged The conflict, and more frequent cries of death, Mingling with imprecations and with prayers, Rose through the din of war. By this the blood Which Deva down her fatal channel pour'd, Purpling Pionia's course, had reach'd and stain'd The wider stream of Sella. Soon far off The frequent glance of spears and gleam of arms Were seen, which sparkled to the westering orb, Where down the vale impatient to complete The glorious work so well that day begun, Pelayo led his troops. On foot they came, Chieftains and men alike; the Oaken Cross Triumphant borne on high, precedes their march, And broad and bright the argent banner shone. Roderick, who dealing death from side to side, Had through the Moorish army now made way, Beheld it flash, and judging well what aid Approach'd, with sudden impulse that way rode, To tell of what had pass'd, . . lest in the strife They should engage with Julian's men, and mar The mighty consummation. One ran on To meet him fleet of foot, and having given His tale to this swift messenger, the Goth Halted awhile to let Orelio breathe. Siverian, quoth Pelayo, if mine eyes Deceive me not, yon horse, whose reeking sides Are red with slaughter, is the same on whom The apostate Orpas in his vauntery Wont to parade the streets of Cordoba. But thou shouldst know him best; regard him well: Is't not Orelio? Either it is he, The old man replied, or one so like to him, Whom all thought matchless, that similitude Would be the greater wonder. But behold, What man is he who in that disarray Doth with such power and majesty bestride The noble steed, as if he felt himself In his own proper seat? Look how he leans To cherish him; and how the gallant horse Curves up his stately neck, and bends his head, As if again to court that gentle touch, And answer to the voice which praises him. Can it be Maccabee? rejoin'd the King, Or are the secret wishes of my soul Indeed fulfill'd, and hath the grave given up Its dead? ... So saying, on the old man he turn'd Eyes full of wide astonishment, which told The incipient thought that for incredible He spake no farther. But enough had pass'd, For old Siverian started at the words Like one who sees a spectre, and exclaim'd, Blind that I was to know him not till now! My Master, O my Master! He meantime With easy pace moved on to meet their march. King, to Pelayo he began, this day By means scarce less than miracle, thy throne Is stablish'd, and the wrongs of Spain revenged. Orpas the accursed, upon yonder field Lies ready for the ravens. By the Moors Treacherously slain, Count Julian will be found Before Saint Peter's altar; unto him Grace was vouchsafed; and by that holy power Which at Visonia by the Primate's hand Of his own proper act to me was given, Unworthy as I am, . . yet sure I think Not without mystery as the event hath shown, .. Did I accept Count Julian's penitence, And reconcile the dying man to Heaven. Beside him hath his daughter gone to rest. Deal honourably with his remains, and let One grave with Christian rites receive them both. Is it not written that as the Tree falls So it shall lie? In this and all things else, Pelayo answer'd, looking wistfully Upon the Goth, thy pleasure shall be done. Then Roderick saw that he was known, and turn'd His head away in silence. But the old man Laid hold upon his bridle, and look'd up In his master's face, weeping and silently. Thereat the Goth with fervent pressure took His hand, and bending down toward him, said, My good Siverian, go not thou this day To war! I charge thee keep thyself from harm! Thou art past the age for combats, and with whom Hereafter should thy mistress talk of me If thou wert gone? . . Thou seest I am unarm'd; Thus disarray'd as thou beholdest me, Clean through yon miscreant army have I cut My way unhurt; but being once by Heaven Preserved, I would not perish with the guilt Of having wilfully provoked my death. . Give me thy helmet and thy cuirass! . . nay, .. Thou wert not wont to let me ask in vain, Nor to oppose me when my will was known! To thee methinks I should be still the King. Thus saying, they withdrew a little way Within the trees. Roderick alighted there, And in the old man's armour dight himself. Dost thou not marvel by what wonderous chance, Said he, Orelio to his master's hand Hath been restored? I found the renegade Of Seville on his back, and hurl'd him down Headlong to the earth. The noble animal Rejoicingly obey'd my hand to shake His recreant burthen off, and trample out The life which once I spared in evil hour. Now let me meet Witiza's viperous sons In yonder field, and then I may go rest In peace, . . my work is done! And nobly done! Exclaim'd the old man. Oh! thou art greater now Than in that glorious hour of victory When grovelling in the dust Witiza lay, The prisoner of thy hand! . . Roderick replied, O good Siverian, happier victory Thy son hath now achieved, . . the victory Over the world, his sins and his despair. If on the field my body should be found, See it, I charge thee, laid in Julian's grave, And let no idle ear be told for whom Thou mournest. Thou wilt use Orelio As doth beseem the steed which hath so oft Carried a King to battle; . . he hath done Good service for his rightful Lord to-day, And better yet must do. Siverian, now Farewell! I think we shall not meet again Till it be in that world where never change Is known, and they who love shall part no more. Commend me to my mother's prayers, and say That never man enjoy'd a heavenlier peace Than Roderick at this hour. O faithful friend, How dear thou art to me these tears may tell! With that he fell upon the old man's neck; Then vaulted in the saddle, gave the reins, And soon rejoin'd the host. On, comrades, on Victory and Vengeance! he exclaim'd, and took The lead on that good charger, he alone Horsed for the onset. They with one consent Gave all their voices to the inspiring cry, Victory and Vengeance! and the hills and rocks Caught the prophetic shout and roll'd it round. Count Pedro's people heard amid the heat Of battle, and return'd the glad acclaim. The astonish'd Musselmen, on all sides charged, Hear that tremendous cry; yet manfully They stood, and every where with gallant front Opposed in fair array the shock of war. Desperately they fought, like men expert in arms, And knowing that no safety could be found, Save from their own right hands. No former day Of all his long career had seen their chief Approved so well; nor had Witiza's sons Ever before this hour achieved in fight Such feats of resolute valour. Sisibert Beheld Pelayo in the field afoot, And twice essay'd beneath his horse's feet To thrust him down. Twice did the Prince evade The shock, and twice upon his shield received The fratricidal sword. Tempt me no more, Son of Witiza, cried the indignant chief, Lest I forget what mother gave thee birth! Go meet thy death from any hand but mine! He said, and turn'd aside. Fitliest from me! Exclaim'd a dreadful voice, as through the throng Orelio forced his way; fitliest from me Receive the rightful death too long withheld! 'Tis Roderick strikes the blow! And as he spake, Upon the traitor's shoulder fierce he drove The weapon, well-bestow'd. He in the seat Totter'd and fell. The Avenger hasten'd on In search of Ebba; and in the heat of fight Rejoicing and forgetful of all else, Set up his cry as he was wont in youth, Roderick the Goth! ... his war-cry known so well. Pelayo eagerly took up the word, And shouted out his kinsman's name beloved, Roderick the Goth! Roderick and Victory! Roderick and Vengeance! Odoar gave it forth; Urban repeated it, and through his ranks Count Pedro sent the cry. Not from the field Of his great victory, when Witiza fell, With louder acclamations had that name Been borne abroad upon the winds of heaven. The unreflecting throng, who yesterday, If it had pass'd their lips, would with a curse Have clogg'd it, echoed it as if it came From some celestial voice in the air, reveal'd To be the certain pledge of all their hopes. Roderick the Goth! Roderick and Victory! Roderick and Vengeance! O'er the field it spread, All hearts and tongues uniting in the cry; Mountains and rocks and vales re-echoed round; And he, rejoicing in his strength, rode on, Laying on the Moors with that good sword, and smote, And overthrew, and scatter'd, and destroy'd, And trampled down; and still at every blow Exultingly he sent the war-cry forth, Roderick the Goth! Roderick and Victory! Roderick and Vengeance! Thus he made his way, Smiting and slaying through the astonish'd ranks, Till he beheld, where on a fiery barb, Ebba, performing well a soldier's part, Dealt to the right and left his deadly blows. With mutual rage they met. The renegade Displays a scymitar, the splendid gift Of Walid from Damascus sent; its hilt Emboss'd with gems, its blade of perfect steel, Which, like a mirror sparkling to the sun With dazzling splendour, flash'd. The Goth objects His shield, and on its rim received the edge Driven from its aim aside, and of its force Diminish'd. Many a frustrate stroke was dealt On either part, and many a foin and thrust Aim'd and rebated; many a deadly blow Straight, or reverse, delivered and repell'd. Roderick at length with better speed hath reach'd The apostate's turban, and through all its folds The true Cantabrian weapon making way Attain'd his forehead. Wretch! the avenger cried, It comes from Roderick's hand! Roderick the Goth, Who spared, who trusted thee, and was betray'd! Go tell thy father now how thou hast sped With all thy treasons! Saying thus he seized The miserable, who, blinded now with blood, Reel'd in the saddle; and with sidelong step Backing Orelio, drew him to the ground. He shrieking, as beneath the horse's feet He fell, forgot his late-learnt creed, and called On Mary's name. The dreadful Goth pass'd on, Still plunging through the thickest war, and still Scattering, where'er he turn'd, the affrighted ranks. O who could tell what deeds were wrought that day; Or who endure to hear the tale of rage, Hatred, and madness, and despair, and fear, Horror, and wounds, and agony, and death, The cries, the blasphemies, the shrieks, and groans, And prayers, which mingled with the din of arms In one wild uproar of terrific sounds; While over all predominant was heard, Reiterate from the conquerors o'er the field, Roderick the Goth! Roderick and Victory! Roderick and Vengeance! ... Woe for Africa! Woe for the circumcised! Woe for the faith Of the lying Ishmaelite that hour! The Chiefs Have fallen; the Moors, confused and captainless, And panic-stricken, vainly seek to escape The inevitable fate. Turn where they will, Strong in his cause, rejoicing in success, Insatiate at the banquet of revenge, The enemy is there; look where they will, Death hath environed their devoted ranks: Fly where they will, the avenger and the sword Await them, . . wretches! whom the righteous arm Hath overtaken! ... Join'd in bonds of faith Accurs'd, the most flagitious of mankind From all parts met are here; the apostate Greek, The vicious Syrian, and the sullen Copt, The Persian cruel and corrupt of soul, The Arabian robber, and the prowling sons Of A frica, who from their thirsty sands Pray that the locusts on the peopled plain May settle and prepare their way. Conjoined Beneath an impious faith, which sanctifies To them all deeds of wickedness and blood, .. Tea, and halloos them on, . . here are they met To be conjoin'd in punishment this hour. For plunder, violation, massacre, All hideous, all unutterable things, The righteous, the immitigable sword Exacts due vengeance now! the cry of blood Is heard: the measure of their crimes is full; Such mercy as the Moor at Auria gave, Such mercy hath he found this dreadful hour! The evening darken'd; but the avenging sword Turn'd not away its edge till night had closed Upon the field of blood. The Chieftains then Blew the recall, and from their perfect work Return'd rejoicing, all but he for whom All look'd with most expectance. He full sure Had thought upon that field to find his end Desired, and with Florinda in the grave Rest, in indissoluble union join'd. But still where through the press of war he went Half-arm'd, and like a lover seeking death, The arrows past him by to right and left, The spear-point pierced him not, the scymitar Glanced from his helmet; he, when he beheld The rout complete, saw that the shield of Heaven Had been extended over him once more, And bowed before its will. Upon the banks Of Sella was Orelio found, his legs And flanks incarnadined, his poitral smeared With froth and foam and gore, his silver mane Sprinkled with blood, which hung on every hair, Aspersed like dew-drops; trembling there he stood From the toil of battle, and at times sent forth His tremulous voice far echoing loud and shrill, A frequent anxious cry, with which he seem'd To call the master whom he loved so well, And who had thus again forsaken him.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. X. THE POET'S PILGRIMAGE TO WATERLOO. ??????? ?? ??????????? ?????? ????? ?????? ????????. Pindar. Pyth. 2. PROEM. 1 Once more I see thee, Skiddaw! once again Behold thee in thy majesty serene, Where like the bulwark of this favour'd plain, Alone thou standest, monarch of the scene... Thou glorious Mountain, on whose ample breast The sunbeams love to play, the vapours love to rest! 2 Once more, O Derwent, to thy aweful shores I come, insatiate of the accustom'd sight; And listening as the eternal torrent roars, Drink in with eye and ear a fresh delight: For I have wander'd far by land and sea, In all my wanderings still remembering thee. 3 Twelve years, (how large a part of man's brief day!) Nor idly, nor ingloriously spent, Of evil and of good have held their way, Since first upon thy banks I pitch'd my tent. Hither I came in manhood's active prime, And here my head hath felt the touch of time. 4 Heaven hath with goodly increase blest me here, Where childless and opprest with grief I came; With voice of fervent thankfulness sincere Let me the blessings which are mine proclaim: Here I possess, . . what more should I require? Books, children, leisure, . . all my heart's desire. 5 O joyful hour, when to our longing home The long-expected wheels at length drew nigh! When the first sound went forth, “They come, they come!” And hope's impatience quicken'd every eye! “Never had man whom Heaven would heap with bliss More glad return, more happy hour than this.” 6 Aloft on yonder bench, with arms dispread, My boy stood, shouting there his father's name, Waving his hat around his happy head; And there, a younger group, his sisters came: Smiling they stood with looks of pleased surprize, While tears of joy were seen in elder eyes. 7 Soon each and all came crouding round to share The cordial greeting, the beloved sight; What welcomings of hand and lip were there! And when those overflowings of delight Subsided to a sense of quiet bliss, Life hath no purer deeper happiness. 8 The young companion of our weary way Found here the end desired of all her ills; She who in sickness pining many a day Hunger'd and thirsted for her native hills, Forgetful now of sufferings past and pain, Rejoiced to see her own dear home again. 9 Recover'd now, the homesick mountaineer Sate by the playmate of her infancy, Her twin-like comrade, . . render'd doubly dear For that long absence: full of life was she, With voluble discourse and eager mien Telling of all the wonders she had seen. 10 Here silently between her parents stood My dark-eyed Bertha, timid as a dove; And gently oft from time to time she woo'd Pressure of hand, or word, or look of love, With impulse shy of bashful tenderness, Soliciting again the wish'd caress. 11 The younger twain in wonder lost were they, My gentle Kate, and my sweet I sabel: Long of our promised coming, day by day It had been their delight to hear and tell; And now when that long-promised hour was come, Surprize and wakening memory held them dumb. 12 For in the infant mind, as in the old, When to its second childhood life declines, A dim and troubled power doth Memory hold: But soon the light of young Remembrance shines Renew'd, and influences of dormant love Waken'd within, with quickening influence move. 13 O happy season theirs, when absence brings Small feeling of privation, none of pain, Yet at the present object love re-springs, As night-closed flowers at morn expand again! Nor deem our second infancy unblest, When gradually composed we sink to rest. 14 Soon they grew blithe as they were wont to be; Her old endearments each began to seek: And Isabel drew near to climb my knee, And pat with fondling hand her father's cheek; With voice and touch and look reviving thus The feelings which had slept in long disuse. 15 But there stood one whose heart could entertain And comprehend the fullness of the joy; The father, teacher, playmate, was again Come to his only and his studious boy: And he beheld again that mother's eye, Which with such ceaseless care had watch'd his infancy. 16 Bring forth the treasures now, . . a proud display, . . For rich as Eastern merchants we return! Behold the black Beguine, the Sister grey, The Friars whose heads with sober motion turn, The Ark well-fill'd with all its numerous hives, Noah and Shem and Ham and Japhet, and their wives. 17 The tumbler, loose of limb; the wrestlers twain; And many a toy beside of quaint device, Which, when his fleecy troops no more can gain Their pasture on the mountains hoar with ice, The German shepherd carves with curious knife, Earning in easy toil the food of frugal life. 18 It was a group which Richter, had he view'd, Might have deem'd worthy of his perfect skill; The keen impatience of the younger brood, Their eager eyes and fingers never still; The hope, the wonder, and the restless joy Of those glad girls, and that vociferous boy! 19 The aged friend serene with quiet smile, Who in their pleasure finds her own delight; The mother's heart-felt happiness the while; The aunts, rejoicing in the joyful sight; And he who in his gaiety of heart, With glib and noisy tongue perform'd the showman's part. 20 Scoff ye who will! but let me, gracious Heaven, Preserve this boyish heart till life's last day! For so that inward light by Nature given Shall still direct, and cheer me on my way, And brightening as the shades of age descend, Shine forth with heavenly radiance at the end. 21 This was the morning light vouchsafed, which led My favour'd footsteps to the Muses' hill, Whose arduous paths I have not ceased to tread, From good to better persevering still; And if but self-approved, to praise or blame Indifferent, while I toil for lasting fame. 22 And O ye nymphs of Castaly divine! Whom I have dutifully served so long, Benignant to your votary now incline, That I may win your ear with gentle song, Such as, I ween, is ne'er disown'd by you, . . A low prelusive strain, to nature true. 23 But when I reach at themes of loftier thought, And tell of things surpassing earthly sense, (Which by yourselves, O Muses, I am taught,) Then aid me with your fuller influence, And to the height of that great argument, Support my spirit in her strong ascent! 24 So may I boldly round my temples bind The laurel which my master Spenser wore; And free in spirit as the mountain wind That makes my symphony in this lone hour, No perishable song of triumph raise, But sing in worthy strains my Country's praise. PART I. THE JOURNEY. ??? ?????????? ??? ??? ??????? ????. Æschylus. I. FLANDERS. 1 Our world hath seen the work of war's debate Consummated in one momentous day Twice in the course of time; and twice the fate Of unborn ages hung upon the fray: First at Platæa, in that aweful hour When Greece united smote the Persian's power. 2 For had the Persian triumph'd, then the spring Of knowledge from that living source had ceast; All would have fallen before the barbarous King, Art, Science, Freedom; the despotic East, Setting her mark upon the race subdued, Had stamp'd them in the mould of sensual servitude. 3 The second day was that when Martel broke The Musselmen, delivering France opprest, And in one mighty conflict, from the yoke Of misbelieving Mecca saved the West; Else had the Impostor's law destroy'd the ties Of public weal and private charities. 4 Such was the danger when that Man of Blood Burst from the iron Isle, and brought again, Like Satan rising from the sulphurous flood, His impious legions to the battle plain: Such too was our deliverance when the field Of Waterloo beheld his fortunes yield. 5 I, who with faith unshaken from the first, Even when the Tyrant seem'd to touch the skies, Had look'd to see the high-blown bubble burst, And for a fall conspicuous as his rise, Even in that faith had look'd not for defeat So swift, so overwhelming, so complete. 6 Me most of all men it behoved to raise The strain of triumph for this foe subdued, To give a voice to joy, and in my lays Exalt a nation's hymn of gratitude, And blazon forth in song that day's renown, . . For I was graced with England's laurel crown. 7 And as I once had journey'd to behold Far off, Ourique's consecrated field, Where Portugal the faithful and the bold Assumed the symbols of her sacred shield, More reason now that I should bend my way The field of British glory to survey. 8 So forth I set upon this pilgrimage, And took the partner of my life with me, And one dear girl, just ripe enough of age Retentively to see what I should see; That thus with mutual recollections fraught, We might bring home a store for after-thought. 9 We left our pleasant Land of Lakes, and went Throughout whole England's length, a weary way, Even to the farthest shores of eastern Kent: Embarking there upon an autumn day, Toward Ostend we held our course all night, And anchor'd by its quay at morning's earliest light. 10 Small vestige there of that old siege appears, And little of remembrance would be found, When for the space of three long painful years The persevering Spaniard girt it round, And gallant youths of many a realm from far Went students to that busy school of war. 11 Yet still those wars of obstinate defence Their lessons offer to the soldier's hand; Large knowledge may the statesman draw from thence: And still from underneath the drifted sand, Sometimes the storm, or passing foot lays bare Part of the harvest Death has gather'd there. 12 Peace be within thy walls, thou famous town, For thy brave bearing in those times of old; May plenty thy industrious children crown, And prosperous merchants day by day behold Many a rich vessel from the injurious sea, Enter the bosom of thy quiet quay. 13 Embarking there, we glided on between Strait banks raised high above the level land, With many a cheerful dwelling white and green In goodly neigh bourhood on either hand. Huge-timber'd bridges o'er the passage lay, Which wheel'd aside and gave us easy way. 14 Four horses, aided by the favouring breeze, Drew our gay vessel, slow and sleek and large; Crack goes the whip, the steersman at his ease Directs the way, and steady went the barge. Ere evening closed to Bruges thus we came, . . Fair city, worthy of her ancient fame. 15 The season of her splendour is gone by, Yet every where its monuments remain; Temples which rear their stately heads on high, Canals that intersect the fertile plain, Wide streets and squares, with many a court and hall Spacious and undefaced, but ancient all. 16 Time hath not wrong'd her, nor hath Ruin sought Rudely her splendid structures to destroy, Save in those recent days with evil fraught, When Mutability, in drunken joy Triumphant, and from all restraint released, Let loose the fierce and many-headed beast. 17 But for the scars in that unhappy rage Inflicted, firm she stands and undecay'd; Like our first sires', a beautiful old age Is hers, in venerable years array'd; And yet to her benignant stars may bring, What fate denies to man, . . a second spring. 18 When I may read of tilts in days of old, And tourneys graced by chieftains of renown, Fair dames, grave citizens, and warriors bold, If Fancy would pourtray some stately town, Which for such pomp fit theatre should be, Fair Bruges, I shall then remember thee. 19 Nor did thy landscape yield me less delight, Seen from the deck as slow it glided by, Or when beneath us, from thy Belfroy's height, Its boundless circie met the bending sky; The waters smooth and straight, thy proper boast, And lines of road-side trees in long perspective lost. 20 No happier landscape may on earth be seen, Rich gardens all around and fruitful groves, White dwellings trim relieved with lively green, The pollard that the Flemish painter loves, With aspins tall and poplars fair to view, Casting o'er all the land a grey and willowy hue. 21 My lot hath lain in scenes sublime and rude, Where still devoutly I have served and sought The Power divine which dwells in solitude. In boyhood was I wont, with rapture fraught, Amid those rocks and woods to wander free, Where Avon hastens to the Severn sea. 22 In Cintra also have I dwelt erewhile, That earthly Eden, and have seen at eve The sea-mists, gathering round its mountain pile, Whelm with their billows all below, but leave One pinnacle sole seen, whereon it stood Like the Ark on Ararat, above the flood. 23 And now am I a Cumbrian mountaineer; Their wintry garment of unsullied snow The mountains have put on, the heavens are clear, And yon dark lake spreads silently below; Who sees them only in their summer hour Sees but their beauties half, and knows not half their power. 24 Yet hath the Flemish scene a charm for me That soothes and wins upon the willing heart; Though all is level as the sleeping sea, A natural beauty springs from perfect art, And something more than pleasure fills the breast, To see how well-directed toil is blest. 25 Two nights have past; the morning opens well, Fair are the aspects of the favouring sky; Soon yon sweet chimes the appointed hour will tell, For here to music Time moves merrily: Aboard! aboard! no more must we delay, . . Farewell, good people of the Fleur de Bled! 26 Beside the busy wharf the Trekschuit rides, With painted plumes and tent-like awning gay; Carts, barrows, coaches, hurry from all sides, And passengers and porters throng the way, Contending all at once in clamorous speech, French, Flemish, English, each confusing each. 27 All disregardant of the Babel sound, A swan kept oaring near with upraised eye, . . A beauteous pensioner, who daily found The bounty of such casual company; Nor left us till the bell said all was done, And slowly we our watry way begun. 28 Europe can boast no richer, goodlier scene, Than that through which our pleasant passage lay, By fertile fields and fruitful gardens green, The journey of a short autumnal day; Sleek well-fed steeds our steady vessel drew, The heavens were fair, and Mirth was of our crew. 29 Along the smooth canal's unbending line, Beguiling time with light discourse, we went, Nor wanting savoury food nor generous wine. Ashore too there was feast and merriment; The jovial peasants at some village fair Were dancing, drinking, smoking, gambling there. 30 Of these, or of the ancient towers of Ghent Renown'd, I must not tarry now to tell; Of picture, or of church, or monument; Nor how we mounted to that ponderous bell, The Belfroy's boast, which bears old Roland's name, Nor yields to Oxford Tom, or Tom of Lincoln's fame. 31 Nor of that sisterhood whom to their rule Of holy life no hasty vows restrain, Who, meek disciples of the Christian school, Watch by the bed of sickness and of pain: Oh what a strength divine doth Faith impart To inborn goodness in the female heart! 32 A gentle party from the shores of Kent Thus far had been our comrades as befell; Fortune had link'd us first, and now Consent, . . For why should Choice divide whom Chance so well Had join'd, and they to view the famous ground, Like us, were to the Field of Battle bound. 33 Farther as yet they look'd not than that quest, . . The land was all before them where to choose. So we consorted here as seemed best; Who would such pleasant fellowship refuse Of ladies fair and gentle comrades free? . . Certes we were a joyous company. 34 Yet lack'd we not discourse for graver times, Such as might suit sage auditors, I ween; For some among us, in far distant climes The cities and the ways of men had seen; No unobservant travellers they, but well Of what they there had learnt they knew to tell. 35 The one of frozen Moscovy could speak, And well his willing listeners entertain With tales of that inclement region bleak, The pageantry and pomp of Catherine's reign, And that proud city, which with wise intent The mighty founder raised, his own great monument. 36 And one had dwelt with Malabars and Moors, Where fertile earth and genial heaven dispense Profuse their bounty upon Indian shores; Whate'er delights the eye, or charms the sense, The vallies with perpetual fruitage blest, The mountains with unfading foliage drest. 37 He those barbaric palaces had seen, The work of Eastern potentates of old; And in the Temples of the Rock had been, Awe-struck their dread recesses to behold; A gifted hand was his, which by its skill Could to the eye pourtray such wondrous scenes at will. 38 A third, who from the Land of Lakes with me Went out upon this pleasant pilgrimage, Had sojourn'd long beyond the Atlantic sea; Adventurous was his spirit as his age, For he in far Brazil, through wood and waste, Had travell'd many a day, and there his heart was placed. 39 Wild region, . . happy if at night he found The shelter of some rude Tapuya's shed; Else would he take his lodgement on the ground, Or from the tree suspend his hardy bed; And sometimes starting at the jaguar's cries, See through the murky night the prowler's fiery eyes. 40 And sometimes over thirsty deserts drear, And sometimes over flooded plains he went; . . A joy it was his fire-side tales to hear, And he a comrade to my heart's content: For he of what I most desired could tell, And loved the Portugals because he knew them well. 41 Here to the easy barge we bade adieu; Land-travellers now along the well-paved way, Where road-side trees still lengthening on the view, Before us and behind unvarying lay: Through lands well labour'd to Alost we came, Where whilome treachery stain'd the English name. 42 Then saw we Afflighem, by ruin rent, Whose venerable fragments strew the land; Grown wise too late, the multitude lament The ravage of their own unhappy hand; Its records in their frenzy torn and tost, Its precious stores of learning wreck'd and lost. 43 Whatever else we saw was chearful all, The signs of steady labour well repaid; The grapes were ripe on every cottage wall, And merry peasants seated in the shade Of garner, or within the open door, From gather'd hop-vines pluck'd the plenteous store. 44 Through Assche for water and for cakes renown'd We pass'd, pursuing still our way, though late; And when the shades of night were closing round, Brussels received us through her friendly gate, . . Proud city, fated many a change to see, And now the seat of new-made monarchy. II. BRUSSELS. 1 Where might a gayer spectacle be found Than Brussels offer'd on that festive night, Her squares and palaces irradiate round To welcome the imperial Moscovite, Who now, the wrongs of Europe twice redress'd, Came there a welcome and a glorious guest? 2 Her mile-long avenue with lamps was hung, Innumerous, which diffused a light like day; Where through the line of splendour, old and young Paraded all in festival array; While fiery barges, plying to and fro, Illumined as they moved the liquid glass below. 3 By day with hurrying crowds the streets were throng'd, To gain of this great Czar a passing sight; And music, dance, and banquetings prolong'd The various work of pleasure through the night. You might have deem'd, to see that joyous town, That wretchedness and pain were there unknown. 4 Yet three short months had scarcely pass'd away, Since, shaken with the approaching battle's breath, Her inmost chambers trembled with dismay; And now within her walls, insatiate Death, Devourer whom no harvest e'er can fill, The gleanings of that field was gathering still. 5 Within those walls there linger'd at that hour Many a brave soldier on the bed of pain, Whom aid of human art should ne'er restore To see his country and his friends again; And many a victim of that fell debate Whose life yet waver'd in the scales of fate. 6 Some I beheld, for whom the doubtful scale Had to the side of life inclined at length; Emaciate was their form, their features pale, The limbs so vigorous late, bereft of strength; And for their gay habiliments of yore, The habit of the House of Pain they wore. 7 Some in the courts of that great hospital, That they might taste the sun and open air, Crawl'd out; or sate beneath the southern wall; Or leaning in the gate, stood gazing there In listless guise upon the passers by, Whiling away the hours of slow recovery. 8 Others in waggons borne abroad I saw, Albeit recovering, still a mournful sight: Languid and helpless some were stretch'd on straw, Some more advanced sustain'd themselves upright, And with bold eye and careless front, methought, Seem'd to set wounds and death again at nought. 9 Well had it fared with these; nor went it ill With those whom war had of a limb bereft, Leaving the life untouch'd, that they had still Enough for health as for existence left; But some there were who lived to draw the breath Of pain through hopeless years of lingering death. 10 Here might the hideous face of war be seen, Stript of all pomp, adornment, and disguise; It was a dismal spectacle I ween, Such as might well to the beholders' eyes Bring sudden tears, and make the pious mind Grieve for the crimes and follies of mankind. 11 What had it been then in the recent days Of that great triumph, when the open wound Was festering, and along the crowded ways, Hour after hour was heard the incessant sound Of wheels, which o'er the rough and stony road Convey'd their living agonizing load! 12 Hearts little to the melting mood inclined Grew sick to see their sufferings; and the thought Still comes with horror to the shuddering mind Of those sad days when Belgian ears were taught The British soldier's cry, half groan, half prayer, Breathed when his pain is more than he can bear. 13 Brave spirits, nobly had their part been done! Brussels could show, where Senne's slow waters glide, The cannon which their matchless valour won, Proud trophies of the field, ranged side by side, Where as they stood in inoffensive row, The solitary guard paced to and fro. 14 Unconscious instruments of human woe, Some for their mark the royal lilies bore, Fix'd there when Britain was the Bourbon's foe; And some emboss'd in brazen letters wore The sign of that abhorr'd misrule, which broke The guilty nation for a Tyrant's yoke. 15 Others were stampt with that Usurper's name, . . Recorders thus of many a change were they, Their deadly work through every change the same; Nor ever had they seen a bloodier day, Than when as their late thunders roll'd around, Brabant in all her cities felt the sound. 16 Then ceased their occupation. From the field Of battle here in triumph were they brought; Ribands and flowers and laurels half conceal'd Their brazen mouths, so late with ruin fraught; Women beheld them pass with joyful eyes, And children clapt their hands and rent the air with cries. 17 Now idly on the banks of Senne they lay, Like toys with which a child is pleased no more: Only the British traveller bends his way To see them on that unfrequented shore, And as a mournful feeling blends with pride, Remembers those who fought, and those who died. III. THE FIELD OF BATTLE. 1 Southward from Brussels lies the field of blood, Some three hours' journey for a well-girt man; A horseman who in haste pursued his road Would reach it as the second hour began. The way is through a forest deep and wide, Extending many a mile on either side. 2 No chearful woodland this of antic trees, With thickets varied and with sunny glade; Look where he will, the weary traveller sees One gloomy, thick, impenetrable shade Of tall straight trunks, which move before his sight, With interchange of lines of long green light. 3 Here, where the woods receding from the road Have left on either hand an open space For fields and gardens and for man's abode, Stands Waterloo; a little lowly place, Obscure till now, when it hath risen to fame, And given the victory its English name. 4 What time the second Carlos ruled in Spain, Last of the Austrian line by Fate decreed, Here Castanaca reared a votive fane, Praying the Patron Saints to bless with seed His childless sovereign; Heaven denied an heir, And Europe mourn'd in blood the frustrate prayer. 5 That temple to our hearts was hallow'd now: For many a wounded Briton there was laid, With such poor help as time might then allow From the fresh carnage of the field convey'd; And they whom human succours could not save, Here in its precincts found a hasty grave. 6 And here on marble tablets set on high, In English lines by foreign workmen traced, Are names familiar to an English eye; Their brethren here the fit memorials placed, Whose unadorn'd inscriptions briefly tell Their gallant comrades' rank, and where they fell. 7 The stateliest monument of public pride, Enrich'd with all magnificence of art, To honour Chieftains who in victory died, Would wake no stronger feeling in the heart Than these plain tablets, by the soldier's hand Raised to his comrades in a foreign land. 8 Not far removed you find the burial-ground, Yet so that skirts of woodland intervene; A small enclosure, rudely fenced around; Three grave-stones only for the dead are seen: One bears the name of some rich villager, The first for whom a stone was planted there. 9 Beneath the second is a German laid, Whom Bremen, shaking off the Frenchman's yoke, Sent with her sons the general cause to aid; He in the fight received his mortal stroke, Yet for his country's aggravated woes Lived to see vengeance on her hated foes. 10 A son of Erin sleeps below the third; By friendly hands his body where it lay Upon the field of blood had been interr'd, And thence by those who mourn'd him borne away In pious reverence for departed worth, Laid here with holy rites in consecrated earth. 11 Repose in peace, brave soldiers, who have found In Waterloo and Soigny's shade your rest! Ere this hath British valour made that ground Sacred to you, and for your foes unblest, When Marlborough here, victorious in his might Surprized the French, and smote them in their flight. 12 Those wars are as a tale of times gone by, For so doth perishable fame decay, . . Here on the ground wherein the slaughter'd lie, The memory of that fight is pass'd away; . . And even our glorious Blenheim to the field Of Waterloo and Wellington must yield. 13 Soon shall we reach that scene of mighty deeds, In one unbending line a short league hence; Aright the forest from the road recedes, With wide sweep trending south and westward thence; Aleft along the line it keeps its place, Some half hour's distance at a traveller's pace. 14 The country here expands, a wide-spread scene; No Flemish gardens fringed with willows these, Nor rich Brabantine pastures ever green, With trenches lined and rows of aspin trees; In tillage here the unwooded open land Returns its increase to the farmer's hand. 15 Behold the scene where Slaughter had full sway! A mile before us lieth Mount St. John, The hamlet which the Highlanders that day Preserved from spoil; yet as much farther on The single farm is placed, now known to fame, Which from the sacred hedge derives its name. 16 Straight onward yet for one like distance more, And there the house of Belle Alliance stands, So named, I guess, by some in days of yore, In friendship or in wedlock joining hands: Little did they who call'd it thus foresee The place that name should hold in history! 17 Beyond these points the fight extended not.. Small theatre for such a tragedy! Its breadth scarce more, from eastern Papelot To where the groves of Hougoumont on high Rear in the west their venerable head, And cover with their shade the countless dead. 18 But wouldst thou tread this celebrated ground, And trace with understanding eyes a scene Above all other fields of war renown'd, From western Hougoumont thy way begin; There was our strength on that side, and there first, In all its force, the storm of battle burst. 19 Strike eastward then across toward La Haye, The single farm: with dead the fields between Are lined, and thou wilt see upon the way Long wave-like dips and swells which intervene, Such as would breathe the war-horse, and impede, When that deep soil was wet, his martial speed. 20 This is the ground whereon the young Nassau, Emuling that day his ancestors' renown, Received his hurt; admiring Belgium saw The youth proved worthy of his destined crown: All tongues his prowess on that day proclaim, And children lisp his praise and bless their Prince's name. 21 When thou hast reach'd La Haye, survey it well, Here was the heat and centre of the strife; This point must Britain hold whate'er befell, And here both armies were profuse of life: Once it was lost, . . and then a stander by Belike had trembled for the victory. 22 Not so the leader, on whose equal mind Such interests hung in that momentous day; So well had he his motley troops assign'd, That where the vital points of action lay, There had he placed those soldiers whom he knew No fears could quail, no dangers could subdue. 23 Small was his British force, nor had he here The Portugals, in heart so near allied, The worthy comrades of his late career, Who fought so oft and conquer'd at his side, When with the Red Cross join'd in brave advance, The glorious Quinas mock'd the air of France. 24 Now of the troops with whom he took the field, Some were of doubtful faith, and others raw; He station'd these where they might stand or yield; But where the stress of battle he foresaw, There were his links (his own strong words I speak) And rivets which no human force could break. 25 O my brave countrymen, ye answer'd well To that heroic trust! Nor less did ye, Whose worth your grateful country aye shall tell, True children of our sister Germany, Who while she groan'd beneath the oppressor's chain, Fought for her freedom in the fields of Spain. 26 La Haye, bear witness! sacred is it hight, And sacred is it truly from that day; For never braver blood was spent in fight Than Britain here hath mingled with the clay. Set where thou wilt thy foot, thou scarce canst tread Here on a spot unhallow'd by the dead. 27 Here was it that the Highlanders withstood The tide of hostile power, received its weight With resolute strength, and stemm'd and turn'd the flood; And fitly here, as in that Grecian straight, The funeral stone might say, Go, traveller, tell Scotland, that in our duty here we fell. 28 Still eastward from this point thy way pursue. There grows a single hedge along the lane, . . No other is there far or near in view: The raging enemy essay'd in vain To pass that line, . . a braver foe withstood, And this whole ground was moisten'd with their blood. 29 Leading his gallant men as he was wont, The hot assailants' onset to repel, Advancing hat in hand, here in the front Of battle and of danger, Picton fell; Lamented Chief! than whom no braver name His country's annals shall consign to fame. 30 Scheldt had not seen us, had his voice been heard, Return with shame from her disastrous coast: But Fortune soon to fairer fields preferr'd His worth approved, which Cambrial long may boast: France felt him then, and Portugal and Spain His honour'd memory will for aye retain. 31 Hence to the high-wall'd house of Papelot, The battle's boundary on the left, incline; Here thou seest Frischermont not far remote, From whence, like ministers of wrath divine, The Prussians issuing on the yielding foe, Consummated their great and total overthrow. 32 Deem not that I the martial skill should boast Where horse and foot were station'd here to tell, What points were occupied by either host, And how the battle raged, and what befell, And how our great Commander's eagle eye Which comprehended all, secured the victory. 33 This were the historian's, not the poet's part; Such task would ill the gentle Muse beseem, Who to the thoughtful mind and pious heart, Comes with her offering from this aweful theme; Content if what she saw and gather'd there She may in unambitious song declare. 34 Look how upon the Ocean's treacherous face The breeze and summer sunshine softly play, And the green-heaving billows bear no trace Of all the wrath and wreck of yesterday; . . So from the field which here we look'd upon, The vestiges of dreadful war were gone. 35 Earth had received into her silent womb Her slaughter'd creatures: horse and man they lay, And friend and foe, within the general tomb. Equal had been their lot; one fatal day For all, . . one labour, . . and one place of rest They found within their common parent's breast. 36 The passing seasons had not yet effaced The stamp of numerous hoofs impress'd by force Of cavalry, whose path might still be traced. Yet Nature every where resumed her course; Low pansies to the sun their purple gave, And the soft poppy blossom'd on the grave. 37 In parts the careful farmer had renew'd His labours, late by battle frustrated; And where the unconscious soil had been imbued With blood, profusely there like water shed, There had his plough-share turn'd the guilty ground, And the green corn was springing all around. 38 The graves he left for natural thought humane Untouch'd; and here and there where in the strife Contending feet had trampled down the grain, Some hardier roots were found, which of their life Tenacious, had put forth a second head, And sprung, and ear'd, and ripen'd on the dead. 39 Some marks of wreck were scatter'd all around, As shoe, and belt, and broken bandoleer, And hats which bore the mark of mortal wound; Gun-flints and balls for those who closelier peer; And sometimes did the breeze upon its breath Bear from ill-cover'd graves a taint of death. 40 More vestige of destructive man was seen Where man in works of peace had labour'd more; At Hougoumont the hottest strife had been, Where trees and walls the mournful record bore Of war's wild rage, trunks pierced with many a wound, And roofs and half-burnt rafters on the ground. 41 A goodly mansion this, with gardens fair, And ancient groves and fruitful orchard wide, Its dove-cot and its decent house of prayer, Its ample stalls and garners well supplied, And spacious bartons clean, well-wall'd around, Where all the wealth of rural life was found. 42 That goodly mansion on the ground was laid, Save here and there a blacken'd broken wall; The wounded who were borne beneath its shade Had there been crush'd and buried by the fall; And there they lie where they received their doom, . . Oh let no hand disturb that honourable tomb! 43 Contiguous to this wreck the little fane For worship hallow'd, still uninjured stands, Save that its Crucifix displays too plain The marks of outrage from irreverent hands. Alas, to think such irreligious deed Of wrong from British soldiers should proceed! 44 The dove-cot too remains; scared at the fight The birds sought shelter in the forest shade; But still they kept their native haunts in sight, And when few days their terror had allay'd, Forsook again the solitary wood, For their old home and human neigh bourhood. 45 The gardener's dwelling was untouch'd; his wife Fled with her children to some near retreat, And there lay trembling for her husband's life: He stood the issue, saw the foe's retreat, And lives unhurt where thousands fell around, To tell the story of that famous ground. 46 His generous dog was well approved that hour, By courage as by love to man allied; He through the fiery storm and iron shower Kept the ground bravely by his master's side: And now when to the stranger's hand he draws, The noble beast seems conscious of applause. 47 Toward the grove the wall with musket holes Is pierced; our soldiers here their station held Against the foe, and many were the souls Then from their fleshly tenements expell'd. Six hundred Frenchmen have been burnt close by, And underneath one mound their bones and ashes lie. 48 One streak of blood upon the wall was traced, In length a man's just stature from the head; There where it gush'd you saw it uneffaced: Of all the blood which on that day was shed This mortal stain alone remain'd impress'd, . . The all-devouring earth had drunk the rest. 49 Here from the heaps who strew'd the fatal plain Was Howard's corse by faithful hands convey'd, And not to be confounded with the slain, Here in a grave apart with reverence laid, Till hence his honour'd relics o'er the seas Were borne to England, there to rest in peace. 50 Another grave had yielded up its dead, From whence to bear his son a father came, That he might lay him where his own grey head Ere long must needs be laid. That soldier's name Was not remember'd there, yet may the verse Present this reverent tribute to his herse. 51 Was it a soothing or a mournful thought Amid this scene of slaughter as we stood, Where armies had with recent fury fought, To mark how gentle Nature still pursued Her quiet course, as if she took no care For what her noblest work had suffer'd there? 52 The pears had ripen'd on the garden wall; Those leaves which on the autumnal earth were spread, The trees, though pierced and scarr'd with many a ball, Had only in their natural season shed: Flowers were in seed whose buds to swell began When such wild havoc here was made of man! 53 Throughout the garden, fruits and herbs and flowers You saw in growth, or ripeness, or decay; The green and well-trimm'd dial mark'd the hours With gliding shadow as they pass'd away; Who would have thought, to see this garden fair, Such horrors had so late been acted there! 54 Now Hougoumont, farewell to thy domain! Might I dispose of thee, no woodman's hand Should e'er thy venerable groves profane; Untouch'd, and like a temple should they stand, And consecrate by general feeling, wave Their branches o'or the ground where sleep the brave. 55 Thy ruins as they fell should aye remain, . . What monument so fit for those below? Thy garden through whole ages should retain The form and fashion which it weareth now, That future pilgrims here might all things see, Such as they were at this great victory. IV. THE SCENE OF WAR. 1 No cloud the azure vault of heaven distain'd That day when we the field of war survey'd; The leaves were falling, but the groves retain'd Foliage enough for beauty and for shade; Soft airs prevail'd, and through the sunny hours The bees were busy on the year's last flowers. 2 Well was the season with the scene combined. The autumnal sunshine suited well the mood Which here possess'd the meditative mind, . . A human sense upon the field of blood, A Christian thankfulness, a British pride, Temper'd by solemn thought, yet still to joy allied. 3 What British heart that would not feel a flow Upon that ground, of elevating pride? What British cheek is there that would not glow To hear our country blest and magnified? . . For Britain here was blest by old and young, Admired by every heart and praised by every tongue. 4 Not for brave bearing in the field alone Doth grateful Belgium bless the British name; The order and the perfect honour shown In all things, have enhanced the soldier's fame: For this we heard the admiring people raise One universal voice sincere of praise. 5 Yet with indignant feeling they enquired Wherefore we spared the author of this strife? Why had we not, as highest law required, With ignominy closed the culprit's life? For him alone had all this blood been shed, . . Why had not vengeance struck the guilty head? 6 O God! they said, it was a piteous thing To see the after-horrors of the fight, The lingering death, the hopeless suffering, . . What heart of flesh unmoved could bear the sight? One man was cause of all this world of woe, . . Ye had him, . . and ye did not strike the blow! 7 How will ye answer to all after time For that great lesson which ye fail'd to give? As if excess of guilt excused the crime, Black as he is with blood ye let him live! Children of evil, take your course henceforth, For what is Justice but a name on earth! 8 Vain had it been with these in glosing speech Of precedents to use the specious tongue: This might perplex the ear, but fail to reach The heart, from whence that honest feeling sprung: And had I dared my inner sense belie, The voice of blood was there to join them in their cry. 9 We left the field of battle in such mood As human hearts from thence should bear away, And musing thus our purposed route pursued, Which still through scenes of recent bloodshed lay, Where Prussia late with strong and stern delight Hung on her hated foes to persecute their flight. 10 No hour for tarriance that, or for remorse! Vengeance, who long had hunger'd, took her fill. And Retribution held its righteous course: As when in elder time, the Sun stood still On Gibeon, and the Moon above the vale Of Ajalon hung motionless and pale. 11 And what though no portentous day was given To render here the work of wrath compleat, The Sun, I ween, seem'd standing still in heaven To those who hurried from that dire defeat; And when they pray'd for darkness in their flight, The Moon arose upon them broad and bright. 12 No covert might they find; the open land, O'er which so late exultingly they pass'd, Lay all before them and on either hand; Close on their flight the avengers follow'd fast, And when they reach'd Genappe and there drew breath, Short respite found they there from fear and death. 13 That fatal town betray'd them to more loss; Through one long street the only passage lay, And then the narrow bridge they needs must cross Where Dyle, a shallow streamlet, cross'd the way: For life they fled, . . no thought had they but fear, And their own baggage choak'd the outlet here. 14 He who had bridged the Danube's affluent stream, With all the unbroken Austrian power in sight, (So had his empire vanish'd like a dream) Was by this brook impeded in his flight; . . And then what passions did he witness there... Rage, terror, execrations, and despair! 15 Ere thro' the wreck his passage could be made, Three miserable hours, which seem'd like years, Was he in that ignoble strait delay'd; The dreadful Prussian's cry was in his ears, Fear in his heart, and in his soul that hell Whose due rewards he merited so well. 16 Foremost again as he was wont to be In flight, though not the foremost in the strife, The Tyrant hurried on, of infamy Regardless, nor regarding ought but life; . . Oh wretch! without the courage or the faith To die with those whom he had led to death! 17 Meantime his guilty followers in disgrace, Whose pride for ever now was beaten down, Some in the houses sought a hiding place; While at the entrance of that fatal town Others, who yet some show of heart display'd, A short vain effort of resistance made: 18 Feeble and ill-sustain'd! The foe burst through: With unabating heat they search'd around; The wretches from their lurking-holes they drew, . . Such mercy as the French had given they found; Death had more victims there in that one hour Than fifty years might else have render'd to his power. 19 Here did we inn upon our pilgrimage, After such day an unfit resting-place: For who from ghastly thoughts could disengage The haunted mind, when every where the trace Of death was seen, . . the blood-stain on the wall, And musquet-marks in chamber and in hall! 20 All talk too was of death. They shew'd us here The room where Brunswick's body had been laid, Where his brave followers, bending o'er the bier, In bitterness their vow of vengeance made; Where Wellington beheld the slaughter'd Chief, And for awhile gave way to manly grief. 21 Duhesme, whose crimes the Catalans may tell, Died here; . . with sabre strokes the posts are scored, Hewn down upon the threshold where he fell, Himself then tasting of the ruthless sword; A Brunswicker discharged the debt of Spain, And where he dropt the stone preserves the stain. 22 Too much of life hath on thy plains been shed, Brabant! so oft the scene of war's debate; But ne'er with blood were they so largely fed As in this rout and wreck; when righteous Fate Brought on the French, in warning to all times, A vengeance wide and sweeping as their crimes: 23 Vengeance for Egypt and for Syria's wrong; For Portugal's unutterable woes; For Germany, who suffer'd all too long Beneath these lawless, faithless, godless foes; For blood which on the Lord so long had cried, For Earth opprest, and Heaven insulted and defied. 24 We follow'd from Genappe their line of flight To the Cross Roads, where Britain's sons sustain'd Against such perilous force the desperate fight: Deserving for that field so well maintain'd, Such fame as for a like devotion's meed The world hath to the Spartan band decreed. 25 Upon this ground the noble Brunswick died, Led on too rashly by his ardent heart; Long shall his grateful country tell with pride How manfully he chose the better part; When groaning Germany in chains was bound, He only of her Princes faithful found. 26 And here right bravely did the German band Once more sustain their well-deserved applause; As when, revenging there their native land, In Spain they labour'd for the general cause. In this most arduous strife none more than they Endured the heat and burthen of the day. 27 Here too we heard the praise of British worth, Still best approved when most severely tried; Here were broad patches of loose-lying earth, Sufficing scarce the mingled bones to hide, . . And, half-uncover'd graves, where one might see The loathliest features of mortality. 28 Eastward from hence westruck, and reach'd the field Of Ligny, where the Prussian, on that day By far-outnumbering force constrain'd to yield, Fronted the foe, and held them still at bay; And in that brave defeat acquired fresh claim To glory, and enhanced his country's fame. 29 Here was a scene which fancy might delight To treasure up among her cherish'd stores, And bring again before the inward sight Often when she recalls the long-past hours; . . Well-cultured hill and dale extending wide, Hamlets and village spires on every side; 30 The autumnal-tinted groves; the upland mill Which oft was won and lost amid the fray: Green pastures water'd by the silent rill; The lordly Castle yielding to decay, With bridge and barbican and moat and tower, A fairer sight perchance than when it frown'd in power: 31 The avenue before its ruin'd gate, Which when the Castle, suffering less from time Than havoc, hath foregone its strength and state, Uninjured flourisheth in nature's prime; To us a grateful shade did it supply, Glad of that shelter from the noontide sky: 32 The quarries deep, where many a massive block For some Parisian monument of pride, Hewn with long labour from the granite rock, Lay in the change of fortune cast aside; But rightly with those stones should Prussia build Her monumental pile on Ligny's bloody field! 33 The wealthy village bearing but too plain The dismal marks of recent fire and spoil; Its decent habitants, an active train, And many a one at work with needful toil On roof or thatch, the ruin to repair, . . May never War repeat such devastation there! 34 Ill had we done if we had hurried by A scene in faithful history to be famed Through long succeeding ages; nor may I The hospitality let pass unnamed, And courteous kindness on that distant ground, Which strangers as we were for England's sake we found. 35 And dear to England should be Ligny's name, Prussia and England both were proved that day; Each generous nation to the other's fame Her ample tribute of applause will pay; Long as the memory of those labours past, Unbroken may their Fair Alliance last! 36 The tales which of that field I could unfold, Better it is that silence should conceal. They who had seen them shudder'd while they told Of things so hideous; and they cried with zeal, One man hath caused all this, of men the worst, . . O wherefore have ye spared his head accurst! 37 It fits not now to tell our farther way Through many a scene by bounteous nature blest Nor how we found where'er our journey lay, An Englishman was still an honour'd guest; But still upon this point where'er we went, The indignant voice was heard of discontent. 38 And hence there lay, too plainly might we see, An ominous feeling upon every heart: What hope of lasting order could there be, They said, where Justice has not had her part? Wisdom doth rule with Justice by her side; Justice from Wisdom none may e'er divide. 39 The shaken mind felt all things insecure: Accustom'd long to see successful crimes, And helplessly the heavy yoke endure, They now look'd back upon their fathers' times, Ere the wild rule of Anarchy began, As to some happier world, or golden age of man. 40 As they who in the vale of years advance, And the dark eve is closing on their way, When on their mind the recollections glance Of early joy, and Hope's delightful day, Behold, in brighter hues than those of truth, The light of morning on the fields of youth. 41 Those who amid these troubles had grown grey, Recurr'd with mournful feeling to the past; Blest had we known our blessings, they would say, We were not worthy that our bliss should last! Peaceful we were and flourishing and free, But madly we required more liberty! 42 Remorseless France had long oppress'd the land, And for her frantic projects drain'd its blood; And now they felt the Prussian's heavy hand: He came to aid them; bravely had he stood In their defence; . . but oh! in peace how ill The soldier's deeds, how insolent his will! 43 One general wish prevail'd, . . if they might see The happy order of old times restored! Give them their former laws and liberty, This their desires and secret prayers implored; . . Forgetful, as the stream of time flows on, That that which passes is for ever gone. PART II. THE VISION. ????? ??? ????? ????? ??? ????. Pindar. I. THE TOWER. 1 I thought upon these things in solitude, And mused upon them in the silent night; The open graves, the recent scene of blood, Were present to the soul's creative sight; These mournful images my mind possess'd, And mingled with the visions of my rest. 2 Methought that I was travelling o'er a plain Whose limits, far beyond all reach of sense, The aching anxious sight explored in vain. How I came there I could not tell, nor whence; Nor where my melancholy journey lay; Only that soon the night would close upon my way. 3 Behind me was a dolorous, dreary scene, With huge and mouldering ruins widely spread; Wastes which had whilome fertile regions been, Tombs which had lost all record of the dead; And where the dim horizon seem'd to close, Far off the gloomy Pyramids arose. 4 Full fain would I have known what lay before, But lifted there in vain my mortal eye; That point with cloud and mist was cover'd o'er, As though the earth were mingled with the sky. Yet thither, as some power unseen impell'd, My blind involuntary way I held. 5 Across the plain innumerable crowds Like me were on their destined journey bent, Toward the land of shadows and of clouds: One pace they travelled, to one point they went; . . A motley multitude of old and young, Men of all climes and hues, and every tongue. 6 Ere long I came upon a field of dead, Where heaps of recent carnage fill'd the way; A ghastly sight, . . nor was there where to tread, So thickly slaughter'd, horse and man, they lay. Methought that in that place of death I knew Again the late-seen field of Waterloo. 7 Troubled I stood, and doubtful where to go, . . A cold damp shuddering ran through all my frame; Fain would I fly from that dread scene, when lo! A voice as from above pronounced my name; And looking to the sound, by the way-side I saw a lofty structure edified. 8 Most like it seem'd to that aspiring Tower Which old Ambition rear'd on Babel's plain, As if he ween'd in his presumptuous power To scale high Heaven with daring pride profane; Such was its giddy height: and round and round The spiral steps in long ascension wound. 9 Its frail foundations upon sand were placed, And round about it mouldering rubbish lay; For easily by time and storms defaced, The loose materials crumbled in decay: Rising so high, and built so insecure, Ill might such perishable work endure. 10 I not the less went up, and as I drew Toward the top, more firm the structure seem'd, With nicer art composed, and fair to view: Strong and well-built perchance I might have deem'd The pile, had I not seen and understood Of what frail matter form'd, and on what base it stood. 11 There on the summit a grave personage Received and welcomed me in courteous guise; On his grey temples were the marks of age, As one whom years methought should render wise. I saw that thou wert fill'd with doubt and fear, He said, and therefore have I call'd thee here. 12 Hence from this eminence sublime I see The wanderings of the erring crowd below, And pitying thee in thy perplexity, Will tell thee all that thou canst need to know To guide thy steps aright. I bent my head As if in thanks, . . And who art thou? I said. 13 He answer'd, I am Wisdom. Mother Earth Me, in her vigour self-conceiving, bore; And as from eldest time I date my birth, Eternally with her shall I endure; Her noblest offspring I, to whom alone The course of sublunary things is known. 14 Master! quoth I, regarding him, I thought That Wisdom was the child divine of Heaven. So, he replied, have fabling preachers taught, And the dull World a light belief hath given. But vainly would these fools my claim decry, . . Wisdom I am, and of the Earth am I. 15 Thus while he spake I scann'd his features well, Small but audacious was the Old Man's eye; His countenance was hard, and seem'd to tell Of knowledge less than of effrontery. Instruct me then, I said, for thou shouldst know, From whence I came, and whither I must go. 16 Art thou then one who would his mind perplex With knowledge bootless even if attain'd? Fond man! he answer'd; . . wherefore shouldst thou vex Thy heart with seeking what may not be gain'd! Regard not what has been, nor what may be, O Child of Earth, this Now is all that toucheth thee! 17 He who performs the journey of to-day Cares not if yesterday were shower or sun: To-morrow let the heavens be what they may, And what recks he? . . his wayfare will be done. Heedless of what hereafter may befall, Live whilst thou livest, for this life is all! 18 I kept my rising indignation down, That I might hear what farther he would teach; Yet on my darken'd brow the instinctive frown, Gathering at that abominable speech, Maintain'd its place: he mark'd it and pursued, Tuning his practised tongue to subtle flattery's mood: 19 Do I not know thee, . . that from earliest youth Knowledge hath been thy only heart's-desire? Here seeing all things as they are in truth, I show thee all to which thy thoughts aspire: No vapours here impede the exalted sense, Nor mists of earth attain this eminence. 20 Whither thy way, thou askest me, and what The region dark whereto thy footsteps tend, And where by one inevitable lot The course of all yon multitude must end. Take thou this glass, whose perfect power shall aid Thy faulty vision, and therewith explore the shade. 21 Eager I look'd; but seeing with surprize That the same darkness still the view o'erspread, Half angrily I turn'd away mine eyes. Complacent then the Old Man smiled and said, Darkness is all! what more wouldst thou descry? Rest now content, for farther none can spy. 22 Now mark me, Child of Earth! he thus pursued; Let not the hypocrites thy reason blind, And to the quest of some unreal good Divert with dogmas vain thine erring mind: Learn thou, whate'er the motive they may call, That Pleasure is the aim, and Self the spring of all. 23 This is the root of knowledge. Wise are they Who to this guiding principle attend; They as they press along the world's high-way, With single aim pursue their steady end; No vain compunction checks their sure career; No idle dreams deceive; their heart is here. 24 They from the nature and the fate of man, Thus clearly understood, derive their strength; Knowing that as from nothing they began, To nothing they must needs return at length; This knowledge steels the heart and clears the mind, And they create on earth the Heaven they find. 25 Such, I made answer, was the Tyrant's creed Who bruised the nations with his iron rod, Till on yon field the wretch received his meed From Britain, and the outstretch'd arm of God! Behold him now, . . Death ever in his view, The only change for him, . . and Judgement to ensue! 26 Behold him when the unbidden thoughts arise Of his old passions and unbridled power; As the fierce tiger in confinement lies, And dreams of blood that he must taste no more, . . Then waking in that appetite of rage, Frets to and fro within his narrow cage. 27 Hath he not chosen well? the Old Man replied; Bravely he aim'd at universal sway; And never earthly Chief was glorified Like this Napoleon in his prosperous day. All-ruling Fate itself hath not the power To alter what has been: and he has had his hour! 28 Take him, I answer'd, at his fortune's flood; Russia his friend, the Austrian wars surceased, When Kings, his creatures some, and some subdued, Like vassals waited at his marriage feast; And Europe like a map before him lay, Of which he gave at will, or took away. 29 Call then to mind Navarre's heroic chief, Wandering by night and day through wood and glen, His country's sufferings like a private grief Wringing his heart: would Mina even then Those perils and that sorrow have foregone To be that Tyrant on his prosperous throne? 30 But wherefore name I him whose arm was free? A living hope his noble heart sustain'd, A faith which bade him through all dangers see The triumph his enduring country gain'd. See Hofer with no earthly hope to aid, . . His country lost, himself to chains and death betray'd! 31 By those he served deserted in his need; Given to the unrelenting Tyrant's power, And by his mean revenge condemn'd to bleed, . . Would he have barter'd in that aweful hour His heart, his conscience, and his sure renown, For the malignant murderer's crimes and crown? 32 Him too, I know, a worthy thought of fame In that dread trance upheld; . . the foresight sure That in his own dear country his good name Long as the streams and mountains should endure; The herdsmen on the hills should sing his praise, And children learn his deeds through all succeeding days. 33 Turn we to those in whom no glorious thought Len its strong succour to the passive mind; Nor stiring enterprize within them wrought; . . Who to their lot of bitterness resign'd, Endured their sorrows by the world unknown, And look'd for their reward to Death alone: 34 Mothers within Gerona's leager'd wall, Who saw their famish'd children pine and die; . . Widows surviving Zaragoza's fall To linger in abhorr'd captivity; . . Yet would not have exchanged their sacred woe For all the empire of their miscreant foe! 35 Serene the Old Man replied, and smiled with scorn, Behold the effect of error! thus to wear The days of miserable life forlorn, Struggling with evil and consumed with care; . . Poor fools, whom vain and empty hopes mislead! They reap their sufferings for their only meed. 36 O false one! I exclaim'd, whom canst thou fool With such gross sophisms, but the wicked heart? The pupils of thine own unhappy school Are they who chuse the vain and empty part; How oft in age, in sickness, and in woe, Have they complain'd that all was vanity below! 37 Look at that mighty Gaznevide, Mahmood, When pining in his Palace of Delight, He bade the gather'd spoils of realms subdued Be spread before him to regale his sight, Whate'er the Orient boasts of rich and rare, . . And then he wept to think what toys they were! 38 Look at the Russian minion when he play'd With pearls and jewels which surpass'd all price; And now apart their various hues array'd, Blended their colours now in union nice, Then weary of the baubles, with a sigh, Swept them aside, and thought that all was vanity! 39 Wean'd by the fatal Messenger from pride, The Syrian through the streets exposed his shroud; And one that ravaged kingdoms far and wide Upon the bed of sickness cried aloud, What boots my empire in this mortal throe, For the Grave calls me now, and I must go! 40 Thus felt these wretched men, because decay Had touch'd them in their vitals; Death stood by; And Reason when the props of flesh gave way, Purged as with euphrasy the mortal eye. Who seeks for worldly honours, wealth or power, Will find them vain indeed at that dread hour! 41 These things are vain; but all things are not so, The virtues and the hopes of human kind! . . Yea, by the God whom ordering all below, In his own image made the immortal mind, Desires there are which draw from Him their birth, And bring forth lasting fruits for Heaven and Earth. 42 Therefore through evil and through good content, The righteous man performs his part assign'd; In bondage lingering, or with sufferings spent, Therefore doth peace support the heroic mind; And from the dreadful sacrifice of all, Meek woman doth not shrink at Duty's call. 43 Therefore the Martyr clasps the stake in faith, And sings thanksgiving while the flames aspire; Victorious over agony and death, Sublime he stands and triumphs in the fire, As though to him Elijah's lot were given, And that the Chariot and the steeds of Heaven. II. THE EVIL PROPHET. 1 With that my passionate discourse I brake; Too fast the thought, too strong the feeling came. Composed the Old Man listen'd while I spake, Nor moved to wrath, nor capable of shame; And when I ceased, unalter'd was his mien, His hard eye unabash'd, his front serene. 2 Hard is it error from the mind to weed, He answer'd, where it strikes so deep a root. Let us to other argument proceed, And if we may, discover what the fruit Of this long strife, . . what harvest of great good The World shall reap for all this cost of blood! 3 Assuming then a frown as thus he said, He stretch'd his hand from that commanding height, Behold, quoth he, where thrice ten thousand dead Are laid, the victims of a single fight! And thrice ten thousand more at Ligny lie, Slain for the prelude to this tragedy! 4 This but a page of the great book of war, . . A drop amid the sea of human woes! . . . Thou canst remember when the Morning Star Of Freedom on rejoicing France arose, Over her vine-clad hills and regions gay, Fair even as Phosphor who foreruns the day. 5 Such and so beautiful that Star's uprise; But soon the glorious dawn was overcast: A baleful track it held across the skies, Till now through all its fatal changes past, Its course fulfill'd, its aspects understood, On Waterloo it hath gone down in blood. 6 Where now the hopes with which thine ardent youth Rejoicingly to run its race began? Where now the reign of Liberty and Truth, The Rights Omnipotent of Equal Man, The principles should make all discord cease, And bid poor humankind repose at length in peace? 7 Behold the Bourbon to that throne by force Restored, from whence by fury he was cast: Thus to the point where it began its course, The melancholy cycle comes at last; And what are all the intermediate years? . . What, but a bootless waste of blood and tears! 8 The peace which thus at Waterloo ye won, Shall it endure with this exasperate foe? In gratitude for all that ye have done, Will France her ancient enmity forego? Her wounded spirit, her envenom'd will Ye know, . . and ample means are left her still. 9 What though the tresses of her strength be shorn, The roots remain untouch'd; and as of old The bondsman Samson felt his power return To his knit sinews, so shall ye behold France, like a giant fresh from sleep, arise And rush upon her slumbering enemies. 10 Woe then for Belgium! for this ill-doom'd land, The theatre of strife through every age! Look from this eminence whereon we stand, . . What is the region round us but a stage For the mad pastime of Ambition made, Whereon War's dreadful drama may be play'd? 11 Thus hath it been from history's earliest light, When yonder by the Sabis Cæsar stood, And saw his legions, raging from the fight, Root out the noble nation they subdued; Even at this day the peasant findeth there The relics of that ruthless massacre. 12 Need I recall the long religious strife? Or William's hard-fought fields? or Marlborough's fame Here purchased at such lavish price of life, . . Or Fontenoy, or Fleurus' later name? Wherever here the foot of man may tread, The blood of man hath on that spot been shed. 13 Shall then Futurity a happier train Unfold, than this dark picture of the past? Dream'st thou again of some Saturnian reign, Or that this ill-compacted realm should last? Its wealth and weakness to the foe are known, And the first shock subverts its baseless throne. 14 O wretched country, better should thy soil Be laid again beneath the invading seas, Thou goodliest masterpiece of human toil, If still thou must be doom'd to scenes like these! O Destiny inexorable and blind! O miserable lot of poor mankind! 15 Saying thus, he fix'd on me a searching eye Of stern regard, as if my heart to reach: Yet gave he now no leisure to reply; For ere I might dispose my thoughts for speech, The Old Man, as one who felt and understood His strength, the theme of his discourse pursued. 16 If we look farther, what shall we behold But every where the swelling seeds of ill, Half-smother'd fires, and causes manifold Of strife to come; the powerful watching still For fresh occasion to enlarge his power, The weak and injured waiting for their hour! 17 Will the rude Cossack with his spoils bear back The love of peace and humanizing art? Think ye the mighty Moscovite shall lack Some specious business for the ambitious heart; Or the black Eagle, when she moults her plume, The form and temper of the Dove assume? 18 From the old Germanic chaos hath there risen A happier order of establish'd things? And is the Italian Mind from papal prison Set free to soar upon its native wings? Or look to Spain, and let her Despot tell If there thy high-raised hopes are answer'd well! 19 At that appeal my spirit breathed a groan, But he triumphantly pursued his speech: O Child of Earth, he cried with loftier tone, The present and the past one lesson teach; Look where thou wilt, the history of man Is but a thorny maze, without a plan! 20 The winds which have in viewless heaven their birth, The waves which in their fury meet the clouds, The central storms which shake the solid earth, And from volcanoes burst in fiery floods, Are not more vague and purportless and blind, Than is the course of things among mankind! 21 Rash hands unravel what the wise have spun; Realms which in story fill so large a part, Rear'd by the strong are by the weak undone; Barbarians overthrow the works of art, And what force spares is sapp'd by sure decay, . . So earthly things are changed and pass away. 22 And think not thou thy England hath a spell, That she this general fortune should elude; Easier to crush the foreign foe, than quell The malice which misleads the multitude, And that dread malady of erring zeal, Which like a cancer eats into the commonweal. 23 The fabric of her power is undermined; The earthquake underneath it will have way, And all that glorious structure, as the wind Scatters a summer cloud, be swept away: For Destiny on this terrestrial ball Drives on her iron car, and crushes all. 24 Thus as he ended, his mysterious form Enlarged, grew dim, and vanish'd from my view. At once on all sides rush'd the gather'd storm, The thunders roll'd around, the wild winds blew, And as the tempest round the summit beat, The whole frail fabric shook beneath my feet. III. THE SACRED MOUNTAIN. 1 But then methought I heard a voice exclaim, Hither, my Son, Oh, hither take thy flight! A heavenly voice which call'd me by my name, And bade me hasten from that treacherous height: The voice it was which I was wont to hear, Sweet as a Mother's to her infant's ear. 2 I hesitated not, but at the call Sprung from the summit of that tottering tower. There is a motion known in dreams to all, When buoyant by some self-sustaining power, Through air we seem to glide, as if set free From all encumbrance of mortality. 3 Thus borne aloft I reach'd the Sacred Hill, And left the scene of tempests far behind: But that old tempter's parting language still Press'd like a painful burthen on my mind; The troubled soul had lost her inward light, And all within was black as Erebus and Night. 4 The Thoughts which I had known in youth return'd, But, oh, how changed! a sad and spectral train: And while for all the miseries past I mourn'd, And for the lives which had been given in vain, In sorrow and in fear I turn'd mine eye From the dark aspects of futurity. 5 I sought the thickest woodland's shade profound, As suited best my melancholy mood, And cast myself upon the gloomy ground. When lo! a gradual radiance fill'd the wood; A heavenly presence rose upon my view, And in that form divine the aweful Muse I knew. 6 Hath then that Spirit false perplex'd thy heart, O thou of little faith! severe she cried. Bear with me, Goddess, heavenly as thou art, Bear with my earthly nature! I replied, And let me pour into thine ear my grief: Thou canst enlighten, thou canst give relief. 7 The ploughshare had gone deep, the sower's hand Had scatter'd in the open soil the grain; The harrow too had well prepared the land; I look'd to see the fruit of all this pain! . . Alas! the thorns and old inveterate weed Have sprung again, and stifled the good seed. 8 I hoped that Italy should break her chains, Foreign and papal, with the world's applause, Knit in firm union her divided reigns, And rear a well-built pile of equal laws: Then might the wrongs of Venice be forgiven, And joy should reach Petrarca's soul in Heaven. 9 I hoped that that abhorr'd Idolatry Had in the strife received its mortal wound: The Souls which from beneath the Altar cry, At length, I thought, had their just vengeance found; . . In purple and in scarlet clad, behold The Harlot sits, adorn'd with gems and gold! 10 The golden cup she bears full to the brim Of her abominations as of yore! Her eyeballs with inebriate triumph swim; Tho' drunk with righteous blood she thirsts for more, Eager to reassert her influence fell, And once again let loose the Dogs of Hell. 11 Woe for that people too who by their path For these late triumphs first made plain the way; Whom in the Valley of the Shade of Death No fears nor fiery sufferings could dismay: Art could not tempt, nor violence enthrall Their firm devotion, faithful found through all. 12 Strange race of haughty heart and stubborn will, Slavery they love and chains with pride they wear; Inflexible alike in good or ill, The inveterate stamp of servitude they bear. Oh fate perverse, to see all change withstood, There only where all change must needs be good! 13 But them no foe can force, nor friend persuade; Impassive souls in iron forms inclosed, As though of human mould they were not made, But of some sterner elements composed, Against offending nations to be sent, The ruthless ministers of punishment. 14 Where are those Minas after that career Wherewith all Europe rang from side to side? In exile wandering! Where the Mountaineer, . . Late, like Pelayo, the Asturian's pride? Had Ferdinand no mercy for that life, Exposed so long for him in daily, . . hourly strife! 15 From her Athenian orator of old Greece never listen'd to sublimer strain Than that with which, for truth and freedom bold, Quintana moved the inmost soul of Spain. What meed is his let Ferdinand declare... Chains, and the silent dungeon, and despair! 16 For this hath England borne so brave a part! Spent with endurance, or in battle slain, Is it for this so many an English heart Lies mingled with the insensate soil of Spain! Is this the issue, this the happy birth In those long throes and that strong agony brought forth! 17 And oh! if England's fatal hour draw nigh, . . If that most glorious edifice should fall By the wild hands of bestial Anarchy, . . Then might it seem that He who ordereth all Doth take for sublunary things no care: . . The burthen of that thought is more than I can bear. 18 Even as a mother listens to her child My plaint the Muse divine benignant heard, Then answer'd in reproving accents mild, What if thou seest the fruit of hope deferr'd, Dost thou for this in faltering faith repine? A manlier, wiser virtue should be thine! 19 Ere the good seed can give its fruit in Spain, The light must shine on that bedarken'd land, And Italy must break her papal chain, Ere the soil answer to the sower's hand; For till the sons their fathers' fault repent, The old error brings its direful punishment. 20 Hath not experience bade the wise man see Poor hope from innovations premature? All sudden change is ill: slow grows the tree Which in its strength through ages shall endure. In that ungrateful earth it long may lie Dormant, but fear not that the seed should die. 21 Falsely that Tempter taught thee that the past Was but a blind inextricable maze; Falsely he taught that evil overcast With gathering tempests these propitious days, That he in subtle snares thy soul might bind, And rob thee of thy hopes for humankind. 22 He told thee the beginning and the end Were indistinguishable all, and dark; And when from his vain Tower he bade thee bend Thy curious eye, well knew he that no spark Of heavenly light would reach the baffled sense, The mists of earth lay round him all too dense. 23 Must I, as thou hadst chosen the evil part, Tell thee that Man is free and God is good? These primal truths are rooted in thy heart: But these being rightly felt and understood, Should bring with them a hope, calm, constant, sure, Patient, and on the rock of faith secure. 24 The Monitress Divine, as thus she spake, Induced me gently on, ascending still, And thus emerging from that mournful brake We drew toward the summit of the hill, And reach'd a green and sunny place, so fair As well with long-lost Eden might compare. 25 Broad cedars grew around that lovely glade, Exempted from decay, and never sere, Their wide-spread boughs diffused a fragrant shade; The cypress incorruptible was here, With fluted stem and head aspiring high, Nature's proud column, pointing to the sky. 26 There too the vigorous olive in its pride, As in its own Apulian soil uncheck'd, Tower'd high, and spread its glaucous foliage wide: With liveliest hues the mead beneath was deck'd, Gift of that grateful tree that with its root Repays the earth from whence it feeds its fruit. 27 There too the sacred bay of brighter green, Exalted its rejoicing head on high; And there the martyrs' holier palm was seen Waving its plumage as the breeze went by. All fruits which ripen under genial skies Grew there as in another Paradise. 28 And over all that lovely glade there grew All wholesome roots and plants of healing power; The herb of grace, the medicinal rue, The poppy rich in worth as gay in flower; The heart's-ease that delighteth every eye, And sage divine and virtuous euphrasy. 29 Unwounded here Judæa's balm distill'd Its precious juice; the snowy jasmine here Spread its luxuriant tresses wide, and fill'd With fragrance the delicious atmosphere; More piercing still did orange-flowers dispense From golden groves the purest joy of sense. 30 As low it lurk'd the tufted moss between, The violet there its modest perfume shed, Like humble virtue, rather felt than seen: And here the Rose of Sharon rear'd its head, The glory of all flowers, to sense and sight Yielding their full contentment of delight. 31 A gentle river wound its quiet way Through this sequester'd glade, meandering wide; Smooth as a mirror here the surface lay, Where the pure lotus floating in its pride, Enjoy'd the breath of heaven, the sun's warm beam, And the cool freshness of its native stream. 32 Here o'er green weeds whose tresses waved outspread, With silent lapse the glassy waters run; Here in fleet motion o'er a pebbly bed Gliding they glance and ripple to the sun; The stirring breeze that swept them in its flight, Raised on the stream a shower of sparkling light. 33 And all sweet birds sung there their lays of love; The mellow thrush, the black-bird loud and shrill, The rapturous nightingale that shook the grove, Made the ears vibrate and the heart-strings thrill; The ambitious lark, that soaring in the sky, Pour'd forth her lyric strain of ecstacy. 34 Sometimes when that wild chorus intermits, The linnet's song was heard amid the trees, A low sweet voice; and sweeter still, at fits The ring-dove's wooing came upon the breeze; While with the wind which moved the leaves among, The murmuring waters join'd in undersong. 35 The hare disported here and fear'd no ill, For never evil thing that glade came nigh; The sheep were free to wander at their will, As needing there no earthly shepherd's eye; The bird sought no concealment for her nest, So perfect was the peace wherewith those bowers were blest. 36 All blending thus with all in one delight, The soul was soothed and satisfied and fill'd: This mingled bliss of sense and sound and sight, The flow of boisterous mirth might there have still'd, And sinking in the gentle spirit deep, Have touch'd those strings of joy which make us weep. 37 Even thus in earthly gardens had it been, If earthly gardens might with these compare; But more than all such influences, I ween There was a heavenly virtue in the air, Which laid all vain perplexing thoughts to rest, And heal'd and calm'd and purified the breast. 38 Then said I to that guide divine, My soul When here we enter'd, was o'ercharged with grief, For evil doubts which I could not controul Beset my troubled spirit. This relief, . . This change, . . whence are they? Almost it might seem I never lived till now; . . all else had been a dream. 39 My heavenly teacher answer'd, Say not seem; . . In this place all things are what they appear; And they who feel the past a feverish dream, Wake to reality on entering here. These waters are the Well of Life, and lo! The Rock of Ages there, from whence they flow. 40 Saying thus we came upon an inner glade, The holiest place that human eyes might see; For all that vale was like a temple made By Nature's hand, and this the sanctuary; Where in its bed of living rock, the Rood Of Man's redemption, firmly planted stood. 41 And at its foot the never-failing Well Of Life profusely flow'd that all might drink. Most blessed Water! Neither tongue can tell The blessedness thereof, nor heart can think, Save ouly those to whom it hath been given To taste of that divinest gift of Heaven. 42 There grew a goodly Tree this Well beside; . . Behold a branch from Eden planted here, Pluck'd from the Tree of Knowledge, said my guide. O Child of Adam, put away thy fear, . . In thy first father's grave it hath its root; Taste thou the bitter, but the wholesome fruit. 43 In awe I heard, and trembled, and obey'd: The bitterness was even as of death; I felt a cold and piercing thrill pervade My loosen'd limbs, and losing sight and breath, To earth I should have fallen in my despair, Had I not clasp'd the Cross and been supported there. 44 My heart, I thought, was bursting with the force Of that most fatal fruit; soul-sick I felt, And tears ran down in such continuous course, As if the very eyes themselves should melt. But then I heard my heavenly teacher say, Drink, and this mortal stound will pass away. 45 I stoopt and drank of that divinest Well, Fresh from the Rock of Ages where it ran; It had a heavenly quality to quell My pain: . . I rose a renovated man, And would not now when that relief was known For worlds the needful suffering have foregone. 46 Even as the Eagle (ancient storyers say) When faint with years she feels her flagging wing, Soars up toward the mid sun's piercing ray, Then fill'd with fire into some living spring Plunges, and casting there her aged plumes, The vigorous strength of primal youth resumes: 47 Such change in me that blessed Water wrought; The bitterness which from its fatal root, The Tree derived with painful healing fraught, Pass'd clean away; and in its place the fruit Produced by virtue of that wondrous wave, The savour which in Paradise it gave. 48 Now, said the heavenly Muse, thou mayst advance, Fitly prepared toward the mountain's height. O Child of Man, this necessary trance Hath purified from flaw thy mortal sight, That with scope unconfined of vision free, Thou the beginning and the end mayst see. 49 She took me by the hand and on we went, Hope urged me forward and my soul was strong; With winged speed we scaled the steep ascent, Nor seem'd the labour difficult or long, Ere on the summit of the sacred hill Upraised I stood, where I might gaze my fill. 50 Below me lay, unfolded like a scroll, The boundless region where I wander'd late, Where I might see realms spread and oceans roll, And mountains from their cloud-surmounting state Dwarf'd like a map beneath the excursive sight, So ample was the range from that commanding height. 51 Eastward with darkness round on every side, An eye of light was in the farthest sky. Lo, the beginning! . . said my heavenly Guide; The steady ray which there thou canst descry, Comes from lost Eden, from the primal land Of man “waved over by the fiery brand.” 52 Look now toward the end! no mists obscure, Nor clouds will there impede the strengthen'd sight; Unblench'd thine eye the vision may endure. I look'd, . . surrounded with effulgent light More glorious than all glorious hues of even, The Angel Death stood there in the open Gate of Heaven. IV. THE HOPES OF MAN. 1 Now, said my heavenly Teacher, all is clear! . . Bear the Beginning and the End in mind, The course of human things will then appear Beneath its proper laws; and thou wilt find, Through all their seeming labyrinth, the plan Which “vindicates the ways of God to Man.” 2 Free choice doth Man possess of good or ill, All were but mockery else. From Wisdom's way Too oft perverted by the tainted will Is his rebellious nature drawn astray; Therefore an inward monitor is given, A voice that answers to the law of Heaven. 3 Frail as he is, and as an infant weak, The knowledge of his weakness is his strength; For succour is vouchsafed to those who seek In humble faith sincere; and when at length Death sets the disembodied spirit free, According to their deeds their lot shall be. 4 Thus, should the chance of private fortune raise A transitory doubt, Death answers all. And in the scale of nations, if the ways Of Providence mysterious we may call, Yet rightly view'd, all history doth impart Comfort and hope and strength to the believing heart. 5 For through the lapse of ages may the course Of moral good progressive still be seen, Though mournful dynasties of Fraud and Force, Dark Vice and purblind Ignorance intervene; Empires and Nations rise, decay and fall, But still the Good survives and perseveres thro' all. 6 Yea even in those most lamentable times, When every-where to wars and woes a prey, Earth seem'd but one wide theatre of crimes, Good unperceived had work'd its silent way, And all those dread convulsions did but clear The obstructed path to give it free career. 7 But deem not thou some over-ruling Fate, Directing all things with benign decree, Through all the turmoil of this mortal state, Appoints that what is best shall therefore be; Even as from man his future doom proceeds, So nations rise or fall according to their deeds. 8 Light at the first was given to humankind, And Law was written in the human heart. If they forsake the Light, perverse of mind, And wilfully prefer the evil part, Then to their own devices are they left, By their own choice of Heaven's support bereft. 9 The individual culprit may sometimes Unpunish'd to his after reckoning go: Not thus collective man, . . for public crimes Draw on their proper punishment below; When Nations go astray, from age to age The effects remain, a fatal heritage. 10 Bear witness, Egypt, thy huge monuments Of priestly fraud and tyranny austere! Bear witness thou whose only name presents All holy feelings to religion dear, . . In Earth's dark circlet once the precious gem Of living light, . . O fallen Jerusalem! 11 See barbarous Africa, on every side To error, wretchedness, and crimes resign'd! Behold the vicious Orient, far and wide Enthrall'd in slavery! As the human mind Corrupts and goes to wreck, Earth sickens there, And the contagion taints the ambient air. 12 They had the Light, and from the Light they turn'd; What marvel if they grope in darkness lost? They had the Law; . . God's natural Law they scorn'd, And chusing error, thus they pay the cost! Wherever Falsehood and Oppression reign, There degradation follows in their train. 13 What then in these late days had Europe been, . . This moral, intellectual heart of earth, . . From which the nations who lie dead in sin Should one day yet receive their second birth, . . To what had she been sunk if brutal Force Had taken unrestrain'd its impious course! 14 The Light had been extinguish'd, . . this be sure The first wise aim of conscious Tyranny, Which knows it may not with the Light endure: But where Light is not, Freedom cannot be; “Where Freedom is not, there no Virtue is;” Where Virtue is not, there no Happiness. 15 If among hateful Tyrants of all times For endless execration handed down, One may be found surpassing all in crimes, One that for infamy should bear the crown, Napoleon is that man, in guilt the first, Pre-eminently bad among the worst. 16 For not, like Scythian conquerors, did he tread From his youth up the common path of blood; Nor like some Eastern Tyrant was he bred In sensual harems, ignorant of good; . . Their vices from the circumstance have grown, His by deliberate purpose were his own, 17 Not led away by circumstance he err'd, But from the wicked heart his error came: By Fortune to the highest place preferr'd, He sought through evil means an evil aim, And all his ruthless measures were design'd To enslave, degrade, and brutalize mankind. 18 Some barbarous dream of empire to fulfil, Those iron ages he would have restored, When Law was but the ruffian soldier's will, Might govern'd all, the sceptre was the sword, And Peace, not elsewhere finding where to dwell, Sought a sad refuge in the convent-cell. 19 Too far had he succeeded! In his mould An evil generation had been framed, By no religion temper'd or controul'd, By foul examples of all crimes inflamed, Of faith, of honour, of compassion void; . . Such were the fitting agents he employ'd. 20 Believing as yon lying Spirit taught, They to that vain philosophy held fast, And trusted that as they began from nought, To nothing they should needs return at last; Hence no restraint of conscience, no remorse, But every baleful passion took its course. 21 And had they triumph'd, Earth had once again, To Violence subdued, and impious Pride, Verged to such state of wickedness, as when The Giantry of old their God defied, And Heaven, impatient of a world like this, Open'd its flood-gates, and broke up the abyss. 22 That danger is gone by. On Waterloo The Tyrant's fortune in the scale was weigh'd, . . His fortune and the World's, . . and England threw Her sword into the balance... down it sway'd: And when in battle first he met that foe, There he received his mortal overthrow. 23 O my brave Countrymen, with that I said, For then my heart with transport overflow'd, O Men of England! nobly have ye paid The debt which to your ancestors ye owed, And gather'd for your children's heritage A glory that shall last from age to age! 24 And we did well when on our Mountain's height For Waterloo we raised the festal flame, And in our triumph taught the startled night To ring with Wellington's victorious name, Making the far-off mariner admire To see the crest of Skiddaw plumed with fire. 25 The Moon who had in silence visited His lonely summit from the birth of time, That hour an unavailing splendour shed, Lost in the effulgence of the flame sublime, In whose broad blaze rejoicingly we stood, And all below a depth of blackest solitude. 26 Fit theatre for this great joy we chose; For never since above the abating Flood Emerging, first that pinnacle arose, Had cause been given for deeper gratitude, For prouder joy to every English heart, When England had so well perform'd her arduous part. 27 The Muse replied with gentle smile benign, . . Well mayst thou praise the land that gave thee birth, And bless the Fate which made that country thine; For of all ages and all parts of earth, To chuse thy time and place did Fate allow, Wise choice would be this England and this Now. 28 From bodily and mental bondage, there Hath Man his full emancipation gain'd; The viewless and illimitable air Is not more free than Thought; all unrestrain'd, Nor pined in want, nor sunk in sensual sloth, There may the immortal Mind attain its growth. 29 There under Freedom's tutelary wing, Deliberate Courage fears no human foe; There undefiled as in their native spring, The living waters of Religion flow; There like a beacon the transmitted Light Conspicuous to all nations burneth bright. 30 The virtuous will she hath, which should aspire To spread the sphere of happiness and light; She hath the power to answer her desire, The wisdom to direct her power aright; The will, the power, the wisdom thus combined, What glorious prospects open on mankind! 31 Behold! she cried, and lifting up her hand, The shaping elements obey'd her will; . . A vapour gather'd round our lofty stand, Roll'd in thick volumes o'er the Sacred Hill, Descending then, its surges far and near Fill'd all the wide subjacent atmosphere. 32 As I have seen from Skiddaw's stony height The fleecy clouds scud round me on their way, Condense beneath, and hide the vale from sight, Then opening, just disclose where Derwent lay Burnish'd with sunshine like a silver shield, Or old Enchanter's glass, for magic for magic forms fit field; 33 So at her will, in that receding sheet Of mist where with the world was overlaid, A living picture moved beneath our feet. A spacious City first was there display'd, The seat where England from her ancient reign Doth rule the Ocean as her own domain. 34 In splendour with those famous cities old, Whose power it hath surpass'd, it now might vie; Through many a bridge the wealthy river roll'd; Aspiring columns rear'd their heads on high, Triumphal arches spann'd the roads, and gave Due guerdon to the memory of the brave. 35 A landscape follow'd, such as might compare With Flemish fields for well-requited toil: The wonder-working hand had every where Subdued all circumstance of stubborn soil; In fen and moor reclaim'd rich gardens smiled, And populous hamlets rose amid the wild. 36 There the old seaman on his native shore Enjoy'd the competence deserved so well; The soldier, his dread occupation o'er, Of well-rewarded service loved to tell; The grey-hair'd labourer there whose work was done, In comfort saw the day of life go down. 37 Such was the lot of eld; for childhood there The duties which belong to life was taught: The good seed early sown and nursed with care, This bounteous harvest in its season brought; Thus youth for manhood, manhood for old age Prepared, and found their weal in every stage. 38 Enough of knowledge unto all was given In wisdom's way to guide their steps on earth, And make the immortal spirit fit for heaven. This needful learning was their right of birth; Further might each who chose it persevere; No mind was lost for lack of culture here. 39 And that whole happy region swarm'd with life, . . Village and town; . . as busy bees in spring In sunny days when sweetest flowers are rife, Fill fields and gardens with their murmuring. Oh joy to see the State in perfect health! Her numbers were her pride and power and wealth. 40 Then saw I, as the magic picture moved, Her shores enrich'd with many a port and pier; No gift of liberal Nature unimproved. The seas their never-failing harvest here Supplied, as bounteous as the air which fed Israel, when manna fell from heaven for bread. 41 Many a tall vessel in her harbours lay, About to spread its canvass to the breeze, Bound upon happy errand to convey The adventurous colonist beyond the seas, Toward those distant lands where Britain blest With her redundant life the East and West. 42 The landscape changed; . . a region next was seen, Where sable swans on rivers yet unfound Glided through broad savannahs ever-green; Innumerous flocks and herds were feeding round, And scatter'd farms appear'd and hamlets fair, And rising towns which made another Britain there. 43 Then thick as stars which stud the moonless sky, Green islands in a peaceful sea were seen; Darken'd no more with blind idolatry, Nor curst with hideous usages obscene, But heal'd of leprous crimes, from butchering strife Deliver'd, and reclaim'd to moral life. 44 Around the rude Morai, the temple now Of truth, hosannahs to the Holiest rung: There from the Christian's equal marriage-vow, In natural growth the household virtues sprung; Children were taught the paths of heavenly peace, And age in hope look'd on to its release. 45 The light those happy Islanders enjoy'd, Good messengers from Britain had convey'd; (Where might such bounty wiselier be employ'd?) One people with their teachers were they made, Their arts, their language, and their faith the same, And blest in all, for all they blest the British name. 46 Then rose a different land, where loftiest trees High o'er the grove their fan-like foliage near; Where spicy bowers upon the passing breeze Diffuse their precious fragrance far and near; And yet untaught to bend his massive knee, Wisest of brutes, the elephant roams free. 47 Ministrant there to health and public good, The busy axe was heard on every side, Opening new channels, that the noxious wood With wind and sunshine might be purified, And that wise Government, the general friend, Might every where its eye and arm extend. 48 The half-brutal Bedah came from his retreat, To human life by human kindness won; The Cingalese beheld that work compleat Which Holland in her day had well begun; The Candian, prospering under Britain's reign, Blest the redeeming hand which broke his chain. 49 Colours and castes were heeded there no more; Laws which depraved, degraded, and opprest, Were laid aside, for on that happy shore All men with equal liberty were blest; And through the land, the breeze upon its swells Bore the sweet music of the sabbath bells. 50 Again the picture changed; those Isles I saw With every crime thro' three long centuries curst, While unrelenting A varice gave the law; Scene of the injured Indians' sufferings first, Then doom'd, for Europe's lasting shame, to see The wider-wasting guilt of Slavery. 51 That foulest blot had been at length effaced; Slavery was gone, and all the power it gave, Whereby so long our nature was debased, Baleful alike to master and to slave. O lovely Isles! ye were indeed a sight To fill the spirit with intense delight! 52 For willing industry and chearful toil Perform'd their easy task, with Hope to aid; And the free children of that happy soil Dwelt each in peace beneath his cocoa's shade; . . A race, who with the European mind, The adapted mould of Africa combined. 53 Anon, methought that in a spacious Square Of some great town the goodly ornament, Three statues I beheld, of sculpture fair: These, said the Muse, are they whom one consent Shall there deem worthy of the purest fame; . . Knowest thou who best such gratitude may claim? 54 Clarkson, I answer'd, first; whom to have seen And known in social hours may be my pride, Such friendship being praise; and one, I ween, Is Wilberforce, placed rightly at his side, Whose eloquent voice in that great cause was heard So oft and well. But who shall be the third? 55 Time, said my Teacher, will reveal the name Of him who with these worthies shall enjoy The equal honour of enduring fame; . . He who the root of evil shall destroy, And from our Laws shall blot the accursed word Of Slave, shall rightly stand with them preferr'd. 56 Enough! the Goddess cried; with that the cloud Obey'd, and closed upon the magic scene: Thus much, quoth she, is to thine hopes allow'd; Ills may impede, delays may intervene, But scenes like these the coming age will bless, If England but pursue the course of righteousness. 57 On she must go progressively in good, In wisdom and in weal, . . or she must wane. Like Ocean, she may have her ebb and flood, But stagnates not. And now her path is plain: Heaven's first command she may fulfil in peace, Replenishing the earth with her increase. 58 Peace she hath won, . . with her victorious hand Hath won through rightful war auspicious peace; Nor this alone, but that in every land The withering rule of violence may cease. Was ever War with such blest victory crown'd! Did ever Victory with such fruits abound! 59 Rightly for this shall all good men rejoice, They most who most abhor all deeds of blood; Rightly for this with reverential voice Exalt to Heaven their hymns of gratitude; For ne'er till now did Heaven thy country bless With such transcendant cause for joy and thankfulness. 60 If they in heart all tyranny abhor, This was the fall of Freedom's direst foe; If they detest the impious lust of war, Here hath that passion had its overthrow; . . As the best prospects of mankind are dear, Their joy should be compleat, their prayers of praise sincere. 61 And thou to whom in spirit at this hour The vision of thy Country's bliss is given, Who feelest that she holds her trusted power To do the will and spread the word of Heaven, . . Hold fast the faith which animates thy mind, And in thy songs proclaim the hopes of humankind. FINIS. CARMEN NUPTIALE. THE LAY OF THE LAUREATE. TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE THE FOLLOWING POEM IS DEDICATED WITH PROFOUND RESPECT BY HER ROYAL HIGHNESS'S MOST DUTIFUL AND MOST DEVOTED SERVANT ROBERT SOUTHEY POET LAUREATE. PROEM. 1 There was a time when all my youthful thought Was of the Muse; and of the Poet's fame, How fair it flourisheth and fadeth not, . . Alone enduring, when the Monarch's name Is but an empty sound, the Conqueror's bust Moulders and is forgotten in the dust. 2 How best to build the imperishable lay Was then my daily care, my dream by night; And early in adventurous essay My spirit imp'd her wings for stronger flight; Fair regions Fancy open'd to my view, . . “There lies thy path, “she said;” do thou that path pursue! 3 “For what hast thou to do with wealth or power, Thou whom rich Nature at thy happy birth Blest in her bounty with the largest dower That Heaven indulges to a child of Earth, . . Then when the sacred Sisters for their own Baptized thee in the springs of Helicon? 4 “They promised for thee that thou shouldst eschew All low desires, all empty vanities; That thou shouldst, still to Truth and Freedom true, The applause or censure of the herd despise; And in obedience to their impulse given, Walk in the light of Nature and of Heaven. 5 “Along the World's high-way let others croud, Jostling and moiling on through dust and heat; Far from the vain, the vicious, and the proud, Take thou content in solitude thy seat; To noble ends devote thy sacred art, And nurse for better worlds thine own immortal part!” 6 Praise to that Power who from my earliest days, Thus taught me what to seek and what to shun Who turn'd my footsteps from the crouded ways, Appointing me my better course to run In solitude, with studious leisure blest, The mind unfetter'd, and the heart at rest. 7 For therefore have my days been days of joy, And all my paths are paths of pleasantness: And still my heart, as when I was a boy, Doth never know an ebb of chearfulness; Time, which matures the intellectual part, Hath tinged my hairs with grey, but left untouch'd my heart. 8 Sometimes I soar where Fancy guides the rein, Beyond this visible diurnal sphere; But most with long and self-approving pain, Patient pursue the historian's task severe; Thus in the ages which are past I live, And those which are to come my sure reward will give. 9 Yea in this now, while Malice frets her hour, Is foretaste given me of that meed divine; Here undisturb'd in this sequester'd bower, The friendship of the good and wise is mine; And that green wreath which decks the Bard when dead, That laureate garland crowns my living head. 10 That wreath which in Eliza's golden days My master dear, divinest Spenser, wore, That which rewarded Drayton's learned lays, Which thoughtful Ben and gentle Daniel bore, . . Grin, Envy, through thy ragged mask of scorn! In honour it was given, with honour it is worn! 11 Proudly I raised the high thanksgiving strain Of victory in a rightful cause achieved; For which I long had look'd and not in vain, As one who with firm faith and undeceived, In history and the heart of man could find Sure presage of deliverance for mankind. 12 Proudly I offer'd to the royal ear My song of joy when War's dread work was done, And glorious Britain round her satiate spear The olive garland twined by Victory won; Exulting as became me in such cause, I offer'd to the Prince his People's just applause. 13 And when, as if the tales of old Romance Were but to typify his splendid reign, Princes and Potentates from conquer'd France, And chiefs in arms approved, a peerless train, Assembled at his Court, . . my duteous lays Preferr'd a welcome of enduring praise. 14 And when that last and most momentous hour, Beheld the re-risen cause of evil yield To the Red Cross and England's arm of power, I sung of Waterloo's unequall'd field, Paying the tribute of a soul embued With deepest joy devout and aweful gratitude. 15 Such strains beseem'd me well. But how shall I To hymeneal numbers tune the string, Who to the trumpet's martial symphony, And to the mountain gales am wont to sing? How may these unaccustom'd accents suit To the sweet dulcimer and courtly lute? 16 Fitter for me the lofty strain severe, That calls for vengeance for mankind opprest; Fitter the songs that youth may love to hear, Which warm and elevate the throbbing breast; Fitter for me with meed of solemn verse, In reverence to adorn the hero's herse. 17 But then my Master dear arose to mind, He on whose song while yet I was a boy, My spirit fed, attracted to its kind, And still insatiate of the growing joy; . . He on whose tomb these eyes were wont to dwell, With inward yearnings which I may not tell; 18 He whose green bays shall bloom for ever young, And whose dear name whenever I repeat, Reverence and love are trembling on my tongue; Sweet Spenser, sweetest Bard; yet not more sweet Than pure was he, and not more pure than wise, High Priest of all the Muses' mysteries. 19 I call'd to mind that mighty Master's song, When he brought home his beautifulest bride, And Mulla murmur'd her sweet undersong, And Mole with all his mountain woods replied; Never to mortal lips a strain was given, More rich with love, more redolent of Heaven. 20 His cup of joy was mantling to the brim, Yet solemn thoughts enhanced his deep delight; A holy feeling fill'd his marriage-hymn, And Love aspired with Faith a heavenward flight. And hast not thou, my Soul, a solemn theme? I said, and mused until I fell into a dream. THE DREAM. 1 Methought I heard a stir of hasty feet, And horses tramp'd and coaches roll'd along, And there were busy voices in the street, As if a multitude were hurrying on; A stir it was which only could befall Upon some great and solemn festival. 2 Such crowds I saw, and in such glad array, It seem'd some general joy had fill'd the land; Age had a sunshine on its cheek that day, And children, tottering by the mother's hand, Too young to ask why all this joy should be, Partook it, and rejoiced for sympathy. 3 The shops, that no dull care might intervene, Were closed; the doors within were lined with heads; Glad faces were at every window seen, And from the cluster'd house-tops and the leads, Others who took their stand in patient row, Look'd down upon the crowds that swarm'd below. 4 And every one of all that numerous throng On head or breast a marriage symbol bore; The war-horse proudly as he paced along Those joyous colours in his forelock wore, And arch'd his stately neck as for delight, To show his mane thus pompously bedight. 5 From every church the merry bells rung round With gladdening harmony heard far and wide; In many a mingled peal of swelling sound, The hurrying music came on every side; And banners from the steeples waved on high, And streamers flutter'd in the sun and sky. 6 Anon the cannon's voice in thunder spake, Westward it came, the East return'd the sound; Burst after burst the innocuous thunders brake, And roll'd from side to side with quick rebound. O happy land, where that terrific voice Speaks but to bid all habitants rejoice! 7 Thereat the crowd rush'd forward one and all, And I too in my dream was borne along. Eftsoon, methought, I reach'd a festal hall, Where guards in order ranged repell'd the throng, But I had entrance through that guarded door. In honour to the laureate crown I wore. 8 That spacious hall was hung with trophies round, Memorials proud of many a well-won day: The flag of France there trail'd toward the ground; There in captivity her Eagles lay, And under each in aye-enduring gold, One well-known word its fatal story told. 9 There read I Nile conspicuous from afar, And Egypt and Maida there were found; And Copenhagen there and Trafalgar; Vimeiro and Busaco's day renown'd; There too was seen Barrosa's bloody name, And Albuhera, dear-bought field of fame. 10 Yon spoils from boastful Massena were won; Those Marmont left in that illustrious fight By Salamanca, when too soon the sun Went down, and darkness hid the Frenchman's flight. These from Vittoria were in triumph borne, When from the Intruder's head Spain's stolen crown was torn. 11 These on Pyrene's aweful heights were gain'd, The trophies of that memorable day, When deep with blood her mountain springs were stain'd. Above the clouds and lightenings of that fray, Wheeling afar the affrighted eagles fled; Ateve the wolves came forth and prey'd upon the dead. 12 And blood-stain'd flags were here from Orthies borne, Trampled by France beneath her flying feet; And what before Thoulouse from Soult were torn When the stern Marshal met his last defeat, Yielding once more to Britain's arm of might, And Wellington in mercy spared his flight. 13 There hung the Eagles which with victory flush'd, From Fleurus and from Ligny proudly flew, To see the Usurper's high-swoln fortune crush'd For ever on the field of Waterloo, . . Day of all days, surpassing in its fame All fields of elder or of later name! 14 There too the painter's universal art, Each story told to all beholders' eyes; And Sculpture there had done her fitting part, Bidding the forms perdurable arise Of those great Chiefs, who in the field of fight Had best upheld their country's sacred right. 15 There stood our peerless Edward, gentle-soul'd, The Sable Prince of chivalry the flower; And that Plantagenet of sterner mould, He who the conquer'd crown of Gallia wore; And Blake, and Nelson, Glory's favourite son, And Marlborough there, and Wolfe and Wellington. 16 But from the statutes and the storied wall, The living scene withdrew my wondering sense; For with accordant pomp that gorgeous hall Was fill'd; and I beheld the opulence Of Britain's Court, . . a proud assemblage there, Her Statesmen, and her Warriors, and her Fair. 17 Amid that Hall of Victory side by side, Conspicuous o'er the splendid company, There sate a royal Bridegroom and his Bride; In her fair cheek, and in her bright blue eye, Her flaxen locks and her benignant mien, The marks of Brunswick's Royal Line were seen. 18 Of princely lineage and of princely heart, The Bridegroom seem'd, . . a man approved in fight, Who in the great deliverance bore his part, And had pursued the recreant Tyrant's flight When driven from injured Germany he fled, Bearing the curse of God and Man upon his head. 19 Guardant before his feet a Lion lay, The Saxon Lion, terrible of yore, Who in his wither'd limbs and lean decay, The marks of long and cruel bondage bore; But broken now beside him lay the chain, Which gall'd and fretted late his neck and mane. 20 A Lion too was couch'd before the Bride; That noble Beast had never felt the chain; Strong were his sinewy limbs and smooth his hide, And o'er his shoulders broad the affluent mane Dishevell'd hung; beneath his feet were laid Torn flags of France whereon his bed he made. 21 Full different were those Lions twain in plight, Yet were they of one brood; and side by side Of old, the Gallic Tyger in his might They many a time had met, and quell'd his pride, And made the treacherous spoiler from their ire Cowering and crippled to his den retire. 22 Two Forms divine on either side the throne, Its heavenly guardians, male and female stood; His eye was bold, and on his brow there shone Contempt of all base things, and pride subdued To wisdom's will: a warrior's garb he wore, And Honour was the name the Genius bore. 23 That other form was in a snow-white vest, As well her virgin loveliness became; Erect her port, and on her spotless breast A blood-red cross was hung: Faith was her name, As by that sacred emblem might be seen, And by her eagle eye, and by her dove-like mien. 24 Her likeness such to that robuster power, That sure his sister she might have been deem'd, Child of one womb at one auspicious hour. Akin they were, yet not as thus it seem'd, For he of Valour was the eldest son, From Areté in happy union sprung. 25 But her to Phronis Eusebeia bore, She whom her mother Dicé sent to earth; What marvel then if thus their features wore Resemblant lineaments of kindred birth, Dicé being child of Him who rules above, Valour his earth-born son; so both derived from Jove. 26 While I stood gazing, suddenly the air Was fill'd with solemn music breathing round; And yet no mortal instruments were there, Nor seem'd that melody an earthly sound, So wonderously it came, so passing sweet, For some strange pageant sure a prelude meet. 27 In every breast methought there seem'd to be A hush of reverence mingled with dismay; For now appear'd a heavenly company Toward the royal seat who held their way; A female Form majestic led them on, . . With aweful port she came, and stood before the Throne. 28 Gentle her mien and void of all offence; But if aught wrong'd her she could strike such fear, As when Minerva in her Sire's defence Shook in Phlegræan fields her dreadful spear. Yet her benignant aspect told that ne'er Would she refuse to heed a suppliant's prayer. 29 The Trident of the Seas in her right hand, The sceptre which that Bride was born to wield, She bore, in symbol of her just command, And in her left display'd the Red-Cross shield. A plume of milk-white feathers overspread The laurell'd helm which graced her lofty head. 30 Daughter of Brunswick's fated line, she said, While joyful realms their gratulations pay, And ask for blessings on thy bridal bed, We too descend upon this happy day; . . Receive with willing ear what we impart, And treasure up our counsels in thy heart! 31 Long may it be ere thou art call'd to bear The weight of empire in a day of woe! Be it thy favour'd lot meantime to share The joys which from domestic virtue flow, And may the lessons which are now imprest, In years of leisure, sink into thy breast. 32 Look to thy Sire, and in his steady way, As in his Father's he, learn thou to tread; That thus, when comes the inevitable day, No other change be felt than of the head Which wears the crown; thy name will then be blest Like theirs, when thou too shalt be call'd to rest. 33 Love peace and cherish peace; but use it so That War may find thee ready at all hours; And ever when thou strikest, let the blow Be swift and sure: then put forth all the powers Which God hath given thee to redress thy wrong, And, powerful as thou art, the strife will not be long. 34 Let not the sacred Trident from thy hand Depart, nor lay the falchion from thy side! Queen of the Seas, and mighty on the land, Thy power shall then be dreaded far and wide: And trusting still in God and in the Right, Thou mayest again defy the World's collected might. 35 Thus as she ceased a comely Sage came on, His temples and capacious forehead spread With locks of venerable eld, which shone As when in wintry morns on Skiddaw's head The cloud, the sunshine, and the snow unite, So silvery, so unsullied, and so white. 36 Of Kronos and the Nymph Mnemosyné He sprung, on either side a birth divine; Thus to the Olympian Gods allied was he, And brother to the sacred Sisters nine, With whom he dwelt in interchange of lore, Each thus instructing each for evermore. 37 They call'd him Praxis in the Olympian tongue, But here on earth Experience was his name. Whatever things have pass'd to him were known, And he could see the future ere it came; Such foresight was his patient wisdom's meed, . . Alas for those who his wise counsels will not heed! 38 He bore a goodly volume, which he laid Between that princely couple on the throne. Lo there my work for this great realm, he said, My work, which with the kingdom's growth has grown, The rights, the usages, the laws wherein Blessed above all nations she hath been. 39 Such as the sacred trust to thee is given, So unimpair'd transmit it to thy line: Preserve it as the choicest gift of Heaven, Alway to make the bliss of thee and thine: The talisman of England's strength is there, . . With reverence guard it, and with jealous care! 40 The next who stood before that royal pair Came gliding like a vision o'er the ground; A glory went before him through the air, Ambrosial odours floated all around, His purple wings a heavenly lustre shed, A silvery halo hover'd round his head. 41 The Angel of the English Church was this, With whose divinest presence there appear'd A glorious train, inheritors of bliss, Saints in the memory of the good revered, Who having render'd back their vital breath To Him from whom it came, were perfected by Death. 42 Edward the spotless Tudor, there I knew, In whose pure breast, with pious nurture fed, All generous hopes and gentle virtues grew; A heavenly diadem adorn'd his head, . . Most blessed Prince, whose saintly name might move The understanding heart to tears of reverent love. 43 Less radiant than King Edward, Cranmer came, But purged from persecution's sable spot; For he had given his body to the flame, And now in that right hand, which flinching not He proffer'd to the fire's atoning doom, Bore he the unfading palm of martyrdom. 44 There too came Latimer, in worth allied, Who to the stake when brought by Romish rage, As if with prison weeds he cast aside The infirmity of flesh and weight of age, Bow-bent till then with weakness, in his shroud Stood up erect and firm before the admiring crowd. 45 With these, partakers in beatitude, Bearing like them the palm, their emblem meet, The Noble Army came, who had subdued All frailty, putting death beneath their feet: Their robes were like the mountain snow, and bright As though they had been dipt in the fountain-springs of light. 46 For these were they who valiantly endured The fierce extremity of mortal pain, By no weak tenderness to life allured, The victims of that hateful Henry's reign, And of the bloody Queen, beneath whose sway Rome lit her fires, and Fiends kept holyday. 47 O pardon me, thrice holy Spirits dear, That hastily I now must pass ye by! No want of duteous reverence is there here; None better knows nor deeplier feels than I What to your sufferings and your faith we owe, Ye valiant champions for the truth below! 48 Hereafter haply with maturer care, (So Heaven permit) that reverence shall be shown. Now of my vision I must needs declare, And how the Angel stood before the throne, And fixing on that Princess as he spake His eye benign, the aweful silence brake. 49 Thus said the Angel, Thou to whom one day There shall in earthly guardianship be given The English Church, preserve it from decay! Ere now for that most sacred charge hath Heaven In perilous times provided female means, Blessing it beneath the rule of pious Queens. 50 Bear thou that great Eliza in thy mind, Who from a wreck this fabric edified; And Her who to a nation's voice resign'd, When Rome in hope its wiliest engines plied, By her own heart and righteous Heaven approved, Stood up against the Father whom she loved. 51 Laying all mean regards aside, fill Thou Her seats with wisdom and with learned worth; That so whene'er attack'd, with fearless brow Her champions may defend her rights on earth; Link'd is her welfare closely with thine own, One fate attends the Altar and the Throne! 52 Think not that lapse of ages shall abate The inveterate malice of that Harlot old; Fallen though thou deem'st her from her high estate, She proffers still the envenom'd cup of gold, And her fierce Beast, whose names are Blasphemy, The same that was, is still, and still must be. 53 The stern Sectarian in unnatural league Joins her to war against their hated foe; Error and Faction aid the bold intrigue, And the dark Atheist seeks her overthrow, While giant Zeal in arms against her stands, Barks with an hundred mouths; a d lifts an hundred hands. 54 Built on a rock, the fabric may repel Their utmost rage, if all within be sound: But if within the gates Indifference dwell, Woe to her then! there needs no outward wound! Through her whole frame benumb'd, a lethal sleep, Like the cold poison of the asp will creep. 55 In thee, as in a cresset set on high, The light of piety should shine far seen, A guiding beacon fix'd for every eye: Thus from the influence of an honour'd Queen, As from its spring, should public good proceed, . . The peace of Heaven will be thy proper meed. 56 So should return that happy state of yore When piety and joy went hand in hand; The love which to his flock the shepherd bore, The old observances which cheer'd the land, The household prayers which, honouring God's high name, Kept the lamp trimm'd and fed the sacred flame. 57 Thus having spoke, away the Angel pass'd With all his train, dissolving from the sight: A transitory shadow overcast The sudden void they left; all meaner light Seeming like darkness to the eye which lost The full effulgence of that heavenly host. 58 Eftsoon, in re-appearing light confess'd, There stood another Minister of bliss, With his own radiance clothed as with a vest. One of the angelic company was this, Who, guardians of the rising human race, Alway in Heaven behold the Father's face. 59 Somewhile he fix'd upon the royal Bride A contemplative eye of thoughtful grief; The trouble of that look benign implied A sense of wrongs for which he sought relief, And that Earth's evils which go unredrest May waken sorrow in an Angel's breast. 60 I plead for babes and sucklings, he began, Those who are now, and who are yet to be; I plead for all the surest hopes of man, The vital welfare of humanity: Oh! let not bestial Ignorance maintain Longer within the land her brutalizing reign. 61 O Lady, if some new-born babe should bless, In answer to a nation's prayers, thy love, When thou, beholding it in tenderness, The deepest, holiest joy of earth shalt prove, In that the likeness of all infants see, And call to mind that hour what now thou hear'st from me. 62 Then seeing infant man, that Lord of Earth, Most weak and helpless of all breathing things, Remember that as Nature makes at birth No different law for Peasants or for Kings, And at the end no difference may befall, The “short parenthesis of life” is all. 63 But in that space, how wide may be their doom Of honour or dishonour, good or ill! From Nature's hand like plastic clay they come, To take from circumstance their woe or weal; And as the form and pressure may be given, They wither upon earth, or ripen there for Heaven. 64 Is it then fitting that one soul should pine For lack of culture in this favour'd land? . . That spirits of capacity divine Perish, like seeds upon the desert sand? . . That needful knowledge in this age of light Should not by birth be every Briton's right? 65 Little can private zeal effect alone; The State must this state-malady redress; For as of all the ways of life, but one... The path of duty, leads to happiness, So in their duty States must find at length Their welfare, and their safety, and their strength. 66 This the first duty, carefully to train The children in the way that they should go; Then of the family of guilt and pain How large a part were banish'd from below! How would the people love with surest cause Their country, and revere her venerable laws! 67 Is there, alas! within the human soul An in-bred taint disposing it for ill? More need that early culture should controul And discipline by love the pliant will! The heart of man is rich in all good seeds; Neglected, it is choak'd with tares and noxious weeds. 68 He ceased, and sudden from some unseen throng A choral peal arose and shook the hall; As when ten thousand children with their song Fill the resounding temple of Saint Paul; . . Scarce can the heart their powerful tones sustain; . . “Save, or we perish!” was the thrilling strain. 69 “Save, or we perish!” thrice the strain was sung By unseen Souls innumerous hovering round, And whilst the hall with their deep chorus rung, The inmost heart was shaken with the sound: I felt the refluent blood forsake my face, And my knees trembled in that aweful place. 70 Anon two female forms before our view Came side by side, a beauteous couplement: The first a virgin clad in skiey blue; Upward to Heaven her steadfast eyes were bent; Her countenance an anxious meaning bore, Yet such as might have made her loved the more. 71 This was that maiden, “sober, chaste, and wise,” Who bringeth to all hearts their best delight: “Though spoused, yet wanting wedlock's solemnize;” “Daughter of Cœlia, and Speranza hight,” I knew her well as one whose portraiture In my dear Master's verse for ever will endure. 72 Her sister too the same divinest page, Taught me to know for that Charissa fair, “Of goodly grace and comely personage, Of wonderous beauty and of bounty rare, Full of great love,” in whose most gentle mien The charm of perfect womanhood were seen. 73 This lovely pair unroll'd before the throne “Earth's melancholy map,” whereon to sight Two broad divisions at a glance were shown, . . The empires these of Darkness and of Light. Well might the thoughtful bosom sigh to mark How wide a portion of the map was dark. 74 Behold, Charissa cried, how large a space Of Earth lies unredeem'd! Oh grief to think That countless myriads of immortal race, In error born, in ignorance must sink, Train'd up in customs which corrupt the heart, And following miserably the evil part! 75 Regard the expanded Orient, from the shores Of scorch'd Arabia and the Persian sea, To where the inhospitable Ocean roars Against the rocks of frozen Tartary; Look next at those Australian isles which lie Thick as the stars that stud the wintry sky; 76 Then let thy mind contemplative survey That spacious region where in elder time Earth's unremember'd conquerors held the sway; And Science, trusting in her skill sublime, With lore abstruse the sculptured walls o'erspread, Its import now forgotten with the dead. 77 From Nile and Congo's undiscover'd springs To the four seas which gird the unhappy land, Behold it left a prey to barbarous Kings, The Robber, or the Trader's ruthless hand; Sinning and suffering, every where unblest, Behold her wretched sons, oppressing and opprest! 78 To England is the Eastern empire given, And hers the sceptre of the circling main; Shall she not then diffuse the word of Heaven Through all the regions of her trusted reign, . . Wage against evil things the hallow'd strife, And sow with liberal hand the seeds of life! 79 By strenuous efforts in a rightful cause Gloriously hath she surpass'd her ancient fame, And won in arms the astonish'd World's applause. Yet may she win in peace a nobler name, And Nations which now lie in error blind, Hail her the Friend and Teacher of Mankind! 80 Oh! what a part were that, Speranza then Exclaim'd, to act upon Earth's ample stage! Oh! what a name among the sons of men To leave, which should endure from age to age! And what a strength that ministry of good Should find in love and human gratitude! 81 Speed thou the work, Redeemer of the World! That the long miseries of mankind may cease! Where'er the Red Cross banner is unfurl'd There let it carry truth, and light, and peace! Did not the Angels who announced thy birth Proclaim it with the sound of Peace on Earth? 82 Bless thou this happy Island, that the stream Of blessing far and wide from hence may flow! Bless it that thus thy saving Mercy's beam Reflected hence may shine on all below! Thy kingdom come! thy will be done, O Lord! And be thy Holy Name through all the world adored! 83 Thus as Speranza cried she clasp'd her hands, And heavenward lifted them in ardent prayer. Lo! at the act the vaulted roof expands, . . Heaven opens, . . and in empyreal air Pouring its splendours through the inferior sky, More bright than noon-day suns the Cross appears on high. 84 A strain of heavenly harmony ensued, Such as but once to mortal ears was known, . . The voice of that Angelic Multitude Who in their Orders stand around the Throne; Peaceupon Earth, Good will to Men! they sung, And Heaven and Earth with that prophetic anthem rung. 85 In holy fear I fell upon the ground, And hid my face, unable to endure The glory, or sustain the piercing sound: In fear and yet in trembling joy, for sure My soul that hour yearn'd strongly to be free, That it might spread its wings in immortality. 86 Gone was the glory when I raised my head, But in the air appear'd a form half-seen, Below with shadows dimly garmented, And indistinct and dreadful was his mien: Yet when I gazed intentlier, I could trace Divinest beauty in that aweful face. 87 Hear me, O Princess! said the shadowy form, As in administering this mighty land Thou with thy best endeavour shalt perform The will of Heaven, so shall my faithful hand Thy great and endless recompence supply; . . My name is DEATH: the last best friend am I! EPILOGUE. 1 Is this the Nuptial Song? with brow severe Perchance the votaries of the world will say: Are these fit strains for Royal ears to hear? What man is he who thus assorts his lay, And dares pronounce with inauspicious breath, In Hymeneal verse, the name of Death? 2 Remote from chearful intercourse of men, Hath he indulged his melancholy mood, And like the hermit in some sullen den, Fed his distemper'd mind in solitude? Or have fanatic dreams distraught his sense, That thus he should presume with bold irreverence? 3 O Royal Lady, ill they judge the heart That reverently approaches thee to-day, And anxious to perform its fitting part, Prefers the tribute of this duteous lay! Not with displeasure should his song be read Who prays for Heaven's best blessings on thy head. 4 He prays that many a year may pass away Ere the State call thee from a life of love; Vex'd by no public cares, that day by day Thy heart the dear domestic joys may prove, And gracious Heaven thy chosen nuptials bless With all a Wife's and all a Mother's happiness. 5 He prays, that for thine own and England's sake, The Virtues and the Household Charities Their favour'd seat beside thy hearth may take; That when the Nation thither turn their eyes, There the conspicuous model they may find Of all which makes the bliss of human-kind. 6 He prays, that when the sceptre to thy hand In due succession shall descend at length, Prosperity and Peace may bless the Land, Truth be thy counsellor, and Heaven thy strength; That every tongue thy praises may proclaim, And every heart in secret bless thy name. 7 He prays, that thou mayest strenuously maintain The wise laws handed down from sire to son; He prays, that under thy auspicious reign All may be added which is left undone, To make the realm, its polity compleat, In all things happy, as in all things great: 8 That through the will of thy enlighten'd mind, Brute man may be to social life reclaim'd; That in compassion for forlorn mankind, The saving Faith may widely be proclaim'd Through erring lands, beneath thy fostering care; . . This is his ardent hope, his loyal prayer. 9 In every cottage may thy power be blest, For blessings which should every where abound; Thy will beneficent from East to West May bring forth good where'er the sun goes round; And thus through future times should Charlotte's fame Surpass our great Eliza's golden name. 10 Of aweful subjects have I dared to sing, Yet surely are they such, as view'd aright, Contentment to thy better mind may bring; A strain which haply may thy heart invite To ponder well, how to thy choice is given A glorious name on Earth, a high reward in Heaven. 11 Light strains, though chearful as the hues of spring, Would wither like a wreath of vernal flowers; The amaranthine garland which I bring Shall keep its verdure through all after hours; . . Yea, while the Poet's name is doom'd to live, So long this garland shall its fragrance give. 12 “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown;” Thus said the Bard who spake of kingly cares: But calmly may the Sovereign then lie down When grateful Nations guard him with their prayers: How sweet a sleep awaits the Royal head, When these keep watch and ward around the bed! L'ENVOY. Go, little Book, from this my solitude, I cast thee on the waters: . . go thy ways! And if, as I believe, thy vein be good, The World will find thee after many days. Be it with thee according to thy worth: . . Go, little Book! in faith I send thee forth. FUNERAL SONG, FOR THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE OF WALES. In its summer pride array'd, Low our Tree of Hope is laid! Low it lies: . . in evil hour, Visiting the bridal bower, Death hath levell'd root and flower. Windsor, in thy sacred shade, (This the end of pomp and power!) Have the rites of death been paid: Windsor, in thy sacred shade Is the Flower of Brunswick laid! Ye whose relics rest around, Tenants of this funeral ground! Know ye, Spirits, who is come, By immitigable doom Summon'd to the untimely tomb? Late with youth and splendour crown'd, Late in beauty's vernal bloom, Late with love and joyaunce blest; Never more lamented guest Was in Windsor laid to rest. Henry, thou of saintly worth, Thou, to whom thy Windsor gave Nativity and name, and grave; Thou art in this hallowed earth Cradled for the immortal birth! Heavily upon his head Ancestral crimes were visited: He, in spirit like a child, Meek of heart and undefiled, Patiently his crown resign'd, And fix'd on heaven his heavenly mind, Blessing, while he kiss'd the rod, His Redeemer and his God. Now may he in realms of bliss Greet a soul as pure as his. Passive as that humble spirit, Lies his bold dethroner too; A dreadful debt did he inherit To his injured lineage due; Ill-starr'd prince, whose martial merit His own England long might rue! Mournful was that Edward's fame, Won in fields contested well, While he sought his rightful claim: Witness Aire's unhappy water, Where the ruthless Clifford fell; And when Wharfe ran red with slaughter, On the day of Towton's field, Gathering, in its guilty flood, The carnage and the ill-spilt blood That forty thousand lives could yield. Cressy was to this but sport,— Poictiers but a pageant vain; And the victory of Spain Seem'd a strife for pastime meant, And the work of Agincourt Only like a tournament; Half the blood which there was spent, Had sufficed again to gain Anjou and ill-yielded Maine, Normandy and Aquitaine, And Our Lady's Ancient towers, Maugre all the Valois' powers, Had a second time been ours.— A gentle daughter of thy line, Edward, lays her dust with thine. Thou, Elizabeth, art here; Thou to whom all griefs were known; Who wert placed upon the bier In happier hour than on the throne. Fatal daughter, fatal mother, Raised to that ill-omen'd station, Father, uncle, sons, and brother, Mourn'd in blood her elevation! Woodville, in the realms of bliss, To thine offspring thou may'st say, Early death is happiness; And favour'd in their lot are they Who are not left to learn below That length of life is length of woe. Lightly let this ground be prest; A broken heart is here at rest. But thou, Seymour, with a greeting, Such as sisters use at meeting, Joy, and sympathy, and love, Wilt hail her in the seats above. Like in loveliness were ye, By a like lamented doom, Hurried to an early tomb. While together, spirits blest, Here your earthly relics rest, Fellow angels shall ye be In the angelic company. Henry, too, hath here his part; At the gentle Seymour's side, With his best beloved bride, Cold and quiet, here are laid The ashes of that fiery heart. Not with his tyrannic spirit, Shall our Charlotte's soul inherit; No, by Fisher's hoary head,— By More, the learned and the good,— By Katharine's wrongs and Boleyn's blood,— By the life so basely shed Of the pride of Norfolk's line, By the axe so often red, By the fire with martyrs fed, Hateful Henry, not with thee May her happy spirit be! And here lies one whose tragic name A reverential thought may claim; That murder'd Monarch, whom the grave, Revealing its long secret, gave Again to sight, that we might spy His comely face and waking eye! There, thrice fifty years, it lay, Exempt from natural decay, Unclosed and bright, as if to say, A plague, of bloodier, baser birth, Than that beneath whose rage he bled, Was loose upon our guilty earth;— Such aweful warning from the dead, Was given by that portentous eye; Then it closed eternally. Ye whose relics rest around, Tenants of this funeral ground; Even in your immortal spheres, What fresh yearnings will ye feel, When this earthly guest appears! Us she leaves in grief and tears; But to you will she reveal Tidings of old England's weal; Of a righteous war pursued, Long, through evil and through good, With unshaken fortitude; Of peace, in battle twice achieved; Of her fiercest foe subdued, And Europe from the yoke reliev'd, Upon that Brabantine plain! Such the proud, the virtuous story, Such the great, the endless glory Of her father's splendid reign! He who wore the sable mail, Might at this heroic tale, Wish himself on earth again. One who reverently, for thee, Raised the strain of bridal verse, Flower of Brunswick! mournfully Lays a garland on thy herse. A VISION OF JUDGEMENT. TO THE KING. I. THE TRANCE. 'Twas at that sober hour when the light of day is receding, And from surrounding things the hues where with day has adorn'd them Fade, like the hopes of youth, till the beauty of earth is departed: Pensive, though not in thought, I stood at the window, beholding Mountain and lake and vale; the valley disrobed of its verdure; Derwent retaining yet from eve a glassy reflection Where his expanded breast, then still and smooth as a mirror, Under the woods reposed; the hills that, calm and majestic, Lifted their heads in the silent sky, from far Glaramara Bleacrag, and Maidenmawr, to Grizedal and westermost Withop. Dark and distinct they rose. The clouds had gather'd above them High in the middle air, huge, purple, pillowy masses, While in the west beyond was the last pale tint of the twilight; Green as a stream in the glen whose pure and chrysolite waters Flow o'er a schistous bed, and serene as the age of the righteous. Earth was hush'd and still; all motion and sound were suspended: Neither man was heard, bird, beast, nor humming of insect, Only the voice of the Greta, heard only when all is in stillness. Pensive I stood and alone, the hour and the scene had subdued me, And as I gazed in the west, where Infinity seem'd to be open, Yearn'd to be free from time, and felt that this life is a thraldom. Thus as I stood, the bell which awhile from its warning had rested, Sent forth its note again, toll, toll, through the silence of evening. 'Tis a deep dull sound that is heavy and mournful at all times, For it tells of mortality always. But heavier this day Fell on the conscious ear its deeper and mournful er import, Yea, in the heart it sunk; for this was the day when the herald Breaking his wand should proclaim, that George our King was departed. Thou art released! I cried: thy soul is deliver'd from bondage! Thou who hast lain so long in mental and visual darkness, Thou art in yonder heaven! thy place is in light and in glory. Come, and behold! . . . methought a startling Voice from the twilight Answered; and therewithal I felt a stroke as of lightning, With a sound like the rushing of winds, or the roaring of waters. If from without it came, I knew not, so sudden the seizure; Or if the brain itself in that strong flash had expended All its electric stores. Of strength and of thought it bereft me; Hearing, and sight, and sense were gone; and when I awaken'd 'Twas from a dream of death, in silence and uttermost darkness; Knowing not where or how, nor if I was rapt in the body, Nor if entranced, or dead. But all around me was blackness, Utterly blank and void, as if this ample creation Had been blotted out, and I were alone in the chaos. Yet had I even then a living hope to sustain me Under that aweful thought, and I strengthen'd my spirit with prayer Comfort I sought and support, and both were found in retiring Into that inner world, the soul's strong hold and her kingdom. Then came again the Voice, but then no longer appalling, Like the voice of a friend it came: O son of the Muses! Be of good heart, it said, and think not that thou art abandon'd; For to thy mortal sight shall the Grave unshadow its secrets; Such as of yore the Florentine saw, Hell's perilous chambers He who trod in his strength; and the arduous Mountain of Penance, And the regions of Paradise, sphere within sphere intercircled. Child of Earth, look up! and behold what passes before thee. II. THE VAULT. So by the Unseen comforted, raised I my head in obedience, And in a vault I found myself placed, arch'd over on all sides. Narrow and low was that house of the dead. Around it were coffins, Each in its niche, and palls, and urns, and funeral hatchments; Velvets of Tyrian dye, retaining their hues unfaded; Blazonry vivid still, as if fresh from the touch of the limner; Nor was the golden fringe, nor the golden broidery tarnish'd. Whence came the light whereby that place of death was discover'd? For there was there no lamp, whose wonderous flame inextinguish'd, As with a vital power endued, renewing its substance, Age after age unchanged, endureth in self-subsistence: Nor did the cheerful beam of day, direct or reflected, Penetrate there. That low and subterranean chamber Saw not the living ray, nor felt the breeze; but for ever Closely immured, was seal'd in perpetual silence and darkness. Whence then this lovely light, calm, pure, and soft, and cerulean, Such as the sapphire sheds? And whence this air that infuses Strength while I breathe it in, and a sense of life, and a stillness, Filling the heart with peace, and giving a joy that contents it? Not of the Earth that light; and these paradisiacal breathings, Not of the Earth are they! These thoughts were passing within me, When there arose around a strain of heavenly music, Such as the hermit hears when Angels visit his slumbers. Faintly it first began, scarce heard; and gentle its rising, Low as the softest breath that passes in summer at evening O'er the Eolian strings, felt there when nothing is moving, Save the thistle-down, lighter than air, and the leaf of the aspin. Then as it swell'd and rose, the thrilling melody deepen'd, Such, methought, should the music be, which is heard in the cloister, By the sisterhood standing around the beatified Virgin, When with her dying eyes she sees the firmament open, Lifts from the bed of dust her arms towards her beloved, Utters the adorable name, and breathes out her soul in a rapture. Well could I then believe such legends, and well could I credit All that the poets old relate of Amphion and Orpheus; How to melodious sounds wild beasts their strength have surrender'd, Men were reclaim'd from the woods, and stones in harmonious order Moved, as their atoms obey'd the mysterious attraction of concord. This was a higher strain; a mightier, holier virtue Came with its powerful tones. O'ercome by the piercing emotion, Dizzy I grew, and it seem'd as though my soul were dissolving. How might I bear unmoved such sounds? For, like as the vapours Melt on the mountain side, when the sun comes forth in his splendour, Even so the vaulted roof and whatever was earthly Faded away; the Grave was gone, and the Dead was awaken'd. III. THE AWAKENING. Then I beheld the King. From a cloud which cover'd the pavement His reverend form uprose: heavenward his face was directed, Heavenward his eyes were raised, and heavenward his arms were extended. Lord, it is past! he cried; the mist, and the weight, and the darkness; . . That long and weary night, that long drear dream of desertion. Father, to Thee I come! My days have been many and evil; Heavy my burthen of care, and grievous hath been my affliction. Thou hast releas'd me at length. O Lord, in Thee have I trusted; Thou art my hope and my strength! . . And then in profound adoration, Crossing his arms on his breast, he bent and worshipp'd in silence. Presently one approach'd to greet him with joyful obeisance; He of whom in an hour of woe, the assassin bereaved us When his counsels most, and his resolute virtue were needed. Thou, said the Monarch, here? Thou, Perceval, summon'd before me? . . . Then as his waken'd mind to the weal of his country reverted, What of his son, he ask'd, what course by the Prince had been follow'd. Right in his Father's steps hath the Regent trod, was the answer: Firm hath he proved and wise, at a time when weakness or error Would have sunk us in shame, and to ruin have hurried us headlong. True to himself hath he been, and Heaven has rewarded his counsels. Peace is obtain'd then at last, with safety and honour! the Monarch Cried, and he clasp'd his hands; . . . I thank Thee, O merciful Father! Now is my heart's desire fulfill'd. With honour surpassing All that in elder time had adorn'd the annals of England, Peace hath been won by the sword, the faithful minister answer'd. Paris hath seen once more the banners of England in triumph Wave within her walls, and the ancient line is establish'd. While that man of blood, the tyrant, faithless and godless, Render'd at length the sport, as long the minion of Fortune, Far away, confined in a rocky isle of the ocean, Fights his battles again, and pleased to win in the chamber What he lost in the field, in fancy conquers his conqueror. There he reviles his foes, and there the ungrateful accuses For his own defaults the men who too faithfully served him; Frets and complains and intrigues, and abuses the mercy that spared him. Oh that my King could have known these things! could have witness'd how England Check'd in its full career the force of her enemy's empire, Singly defied his arms and his arts, and baffled them singly, Roused from their lethal sleep with the stirring example the nations, And the refluent tide swept him and his fortune before it. Oh that my King, ere he died, might have seen the fruit of his counsels! Nay, it is better thus, the Monarch piously answer'd; Here I can bear the joy; it comes as an earnest of Heaven. Righteous art Thou, O Lord! long-suffering, but sure are thy judgements. Then having paused awhile, like one in devotion abstracted, Earth ward his thoughts recurr'd, so deeply the care of his country Lay in that royal soul reposed: and he said, Is the spirit Quell'd which hath troubled the land? and the multitude freed from delusion, Know they their blessings at last, and are they contented and thankful? Still is that fierce and restless spirit at work, was the answer; Still it deceiveth the weak, and inflameth the rash and the desperate. Even now, I ween, some dreadful deed is preparing; For the Souls of the Wicked are loose, and the Powers of Evil Move on the wing alert. Some nascent horror they look for, Be sure! some accursed conception of filth and of darkness Ripe for its monstrous birth. Whether France or Britain be threaten'd, Soon will the issue show; or if both at once are endanger'd, For with the ghosts obscene of Robespierre, Danton, and Hebert, Faux and Despard I saw, and the band of rabid fanatics, They whom Venner led, who rising in frantic rebellion Made the Redeemer's name their cry of slaughter and treason. IV. THE GATE OF HEAVEN. Thus as he spake, methought the surrounding space dilated. Over head I beheld the infinite ether; beneath us Lay the solid expanse of the firmament spread like a pavement: Wheresoever I look'd, there was light and glory around me. Brightest it seem'd in the East, where the New Jerusalem glitter'd. Eminent on a hill, there stood the Celestial City; Beaming afar it shone; its towers and cupolas rising High in the air serene, with the brightness of gold in the furnace, Where on their breadth the splendour lay intense and quiescent: Part with a fierier glow, and a short quick tremulous motion, Like the burning pyropus; and turrets and pinnacles sparkled, Playing in jets of light, with a diamond-like glory coruscant. Groves of all hues of green their foliage intermingled, Tempering with grateful shade the else unendurable lustre. Drawing near, I beheld what over the portal was written: This is the Gate of Bliss, it said; through me is the passage To the City of God, the abode of beatified Spirits. Weariness is not there, nor change, nor sorrow, nor parting; Time hath no place therein; nor evil. Ye who would enter, Drink of the Well of Life, and put away all that is earthly. O'er the adamantine gates an Angel stood on the summit. Ho! he exclaim'd, King George of England cometh to judgment! Hear Heaven! Ye Angels hear! Souls of the Good and the Wicked Whom it concerns, attend! Thou, Hell, bring forth his accusers! As the sonorous summons was utter'd, the Winds, who were waiting, Bore it abroad through Heaven; and Hell, in her nethermost caverns, Heard, and obey'd in dismay. Anon a body of splendour Gather'd before the gate, and veil'd the Ineffable Presence, Which, with a rushing of wings, came down. The sentient ether Shook with that dread descent, aud the solid firmament trembled. Round the cloud were the Orders of Heaven...Archangel and Angel, Principality, Cherub and Seraph, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, and Powers. The Souls of the Good, whom Death had made perfect, Flocking on either hand, a multitudinous army, Came at the aweful call. In semicircle inclining, Tier over tier they took their place: aloft, in the distance, Far as the sight could pierce, that glorious company glisten'd. From the skirts of the shining assembly, a silvery vapour Rose in the blue serene, and moving onward it deepen'd, Taking a denser form; the while from the opposite region Heavy and sulphurous clouds roll'd on, and completed the circle. There with the Spirits accurst, in congenial darkness enveloped, Were the Souls of the Wicked, who wilful in guilt and in error, Chose the service of sin, and now were abiding its wages. Change of place to them brought no reprieval from anguish; They in their evil thoughts and desires of impotent malice, Envy, and hate, and blasphemous rage, and remorse unavailing, Carried a Hell within, to which all outer affliction, So it abstracted the sense, might be deem'd a remission of torment. At the edge of the cloud, the Princes of Darkness were marshall'd: Dimly descried within were wings and truculent faces; And in the thick obscure there struggled a mutinous uproar, Railing, and fury, and strife, that the whole deep body of darkness Roll'd like a troubled sea, with a wide and a manifold motion. V. THE ACCUSERS. On the cerulean floor by that dread circle surrounded, Stood the soul of the King alone. In front was the Presence Veil'd with excess of light; and behind was the blackness of darkness. Then might be seen the strength of holiness, then was its triumph, Calm in his faith he stood, and his own clear conscience upheld him. When the trumpet was blown, and the Angel made proclamation— Lo, where the King appears! Come forward ye who arraign him! Forth from the lurid cloud a Demon came at the summons. It was the Spirit by which his righteous reign had been troubled; Likest in form uncouth to the hideous Idols whom India (Long by guilty neglect to hellish delusions abandon'd,) Worships with horrible rites of self-immolation and torture. Many-headed and monstrous the Fiend; with numberless faces, Numberless bestial ears erect to all rumours, and restless, And with numberless mouths which were fill'd with lies as with arrows. Clamours arose as he came, a confusion of turbulent voices, Maledictions, and blatant tongues, and viperous hisses; And in the hubbub of senseless sounds the watchwords of faction, Freedom, Invaded Rights, Corruption, and War, and Oppression, Loudly enounced were heard. But when he stood in the Presence, Then was the Fiend dismay'd, though with impudence clothed as a garment; And the lying tongues were mute, and the lips which had scatter'd Accusation and slander, were still. No time for evasion This, in the Presence he stood: no place for flight; for dissembling No possibility there. From the souls on the edge of the darkness, Two he produced, prime movers and agents of mischief, and bade them Show themselves faithful now to the cause for which they had labour'd. Wretched and guilty souls, where now their audacity? Where now Are the insolent tongues so ready of old at rejoinder? Where the lofty pretences of public virtue and freedom? Where the gibe, and the jeer, and the threat, the envenom'd invective, Calumny, falsehood, fraud, and the whole ammunition of malice? Wretched and guilty souls, they stood in the face of their Sovereign, Conscious and self-condemn'd; confronted with him they had injured, At the Judgement-seat they stood. Beholding the foremost, Him by the cast of his eye oblique, I knew as the firebrand Whom the unthinking populace held for their idol and hero, Lord of Misrule in his day. But how was that countenance alter'd Where emotion of fear or of shame had never been witness'd; That invincible forehead abash'd; and those eyes wherein malice Once had been wont to shine with wit and hilarity temper'd, Into how deep a gloom their mournful expression had settled! Little avail'd it now that not from a purpose malignant, Not with evil intent he had chosen the service of evil; But of his own desires the slave, with profligate impulse, Solely by selfishness moved, and reckless of aught that might follow. Could he plead in only excuse a confession of baseness? Could he hide the extent of his guilt; or hope to atone for Faction excited at home, when all old feuds were abated, Insurrection abroad, and the train of woes that had follow'd! Discontent and disloyalty, like the teeth of the dragon, He had sown on the winds; they had ripen'd beyond the Atlantic; Thence in natural birth sedition, revolt, revolution; France had received the seeds, and reap'd the harvest of horrors; . . Where...where should the plague be stay'd? Oh, most to be pitied They of all souls in bale, who see no term to the evil They by their guilt have raised, no end to their inner upbraidings! Him I could not choose but know, nor knowing but grieve for. Who might the other be, his comrade in guilt and in suffering, Brought to the proof like him, and shrinking like him from the trial? Nameless the libeller lived, and shot his arrows in darkness; Undetected he pass'd to the grave, and leaving behind him Noxious works on earth, and the pest of an evil example, Went to the world beyond, where no offences are hidden. Mask'd had he been in his life, and now a visor of iron Rivetted round his head, had abolish'd his features for ever. Speechless the slanderer stood, and turn'd his face from the Monarch Iron-bound as it was, . . so insupportably dreadful Soon or late to conscious guilt is the eye of the injured. Caitiffs, are ye dumb? cried the multifaced Demon in anger; Think ye then by shame to shorten the term of your penance? Back to your penal dens! . . . And with horrible grasp gigantic Seizing the guilty pair, he swung them aloft, and in vengeance Hurl'd them all abroad, far into the sulphurous darkness. Sons of Faction, be warn'd! And ye, ye Slanderers! learn ye Justice, and bear in mind that after death there is judgement. Whirling, away they flew. Nor long himself did he tarry, Ere from the ground where he stood, caught up by a vehement whirlwind, He too was hurried away; and the blast with lightning and thunder Vollying aright and aleft amid the accumulate blackness, Scatter'd its inmates accurst, and beyond the limits of ether Drove the hircine host obscene: they howling and groaning Fell precipitate, down to their dolorous place of endurance. Then was the region clear; the arrowy flashes which redden'd Through the foul thick throng, like sheeted argentry floating Now o'er the blue serene, diffused an innocuous splendour, In the infinite dying away. The roll of the thunder Ceased, and all sounds were hush'd, till again from the gate adamantine Was the voice of the Angel heard through the silence of Heaven. VI. THE ABSOLVERS. Ho! he exclaim'd, King George of England standeth in judgement! Hell hath been dumb in his presence. Ye who on earth arraign'd him, Come ye before him now, and here accuse or absolve him! For injustice hath here no place. From the Souls of the Blessed Some were there then who advanced; and more from the skirts of the meeting, Spirits who had not yet accomplish'd their purification, Yet being cleansed from pride, from faction and error deliver'd, Purged of the film wherewith the eye of the mind is clouded, They, in their better state, saw all things clear; and discerning Now in the light of truth what tortuous views had deceived them, They acknowledged their fault, and own'd the wrong they had offer'd; Not without ingenuous shame, and a sense of compunction, More or less, as each had more or less to atone for. One alone remain'd, when the rest had retired to their station: Silently he had stood, and still unmoved and in silence, With a steady mien, regarded the face of the Monarch. Thoughtful awhile he gazed; severe, but serene, was his aspect; Calm, but stern; like one whom no compassion could weaken, Neither could doubt deter, nor violent impulses alter; Lord of his own resolves, . . of his own heart absolute master. Aweful Spirit! his place was with ancient sages and heroes: Fabius, Aristides, and Solon, and Epaminondas. Here then at the Gate of Heaven we are met! said the Spirit; King of England! albeit in life opposed to each other, Here we meet at last. Not unprepared for the meeting Ween I; for we had both outlived all enmity, rendering Each to each that justice which each from each had withholden. In the course of events, to thee I seem'd as a Rebel, Thou a Tyrant to me; . . . so strongly doth circumstance rule men During evil days, when right and wrong are confounded. Left to our hearts we were just. For me, my actions have spoken, That not for lawless desires, nor goaded by desperate fortunes, Nor for ambition, I chose my part; but observant of duty, Self-approved. And here, this witness I willingly bear thee, . . Here, before Angels and Men, in the aweful hour of judgement, . . Thou too didst act with upright heart, as befitted a Sovereign True to his sacred trust, to his crown, his kingdom, and people. Heaven in these things fulfill'd its wise, though inscrutable purpose, While we work'd its will, doing each in his place as became him. Washington! said the Monarch, well hast thou spoken and truly, Just to thyself and to me. On them is the guilt of the contest, Who, for wicked ends, with foul arts of faction and falsehood, Kindled and fed the flame: but verily they have their guerdon. Thou and I are free from offence. And would that the nations, Learning of us, would lay aside all wrongful resentment, All injurious thought, and honouring each in the other Kindred courage and virtue, and cognate knowledge and freedom, Live in brotherhood wisely conjoin'd. We set the example. They who stir up strife, and would break that natural concord, Evil they sow, and sorrow will they reap for their harvest. VII. THE BEATIFICATION. When that Spirit withdrew, the Monarch around the assembly Look'd, but none else came forth; and he heard the voice of the Angel, . . King of England, speak for thyself! here is none to arraign thee. Father, he replied, from whom no secrets are hidden, What should I say? Thou knowest that mine was an arduous station, Full of cares, and with perils beset. How heavy the burthen Thou alone canst tell! Short-sighted and frail hast Thou made us, And Thy judgements who can abide? But as surely Thou knowest The desire of my heart hath been alway the good of my people, Pardon my errors, O Lord, and in mercy accept the intention! As in Thee I have trusted, so let me not now be confounded. Bending forward he spake with earnest humility. Well done, Good and faithful servant! then said a Voice from the Brightness, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.... The ministering Spirits Clapt their pennons therewith, and from that whole army of Angels Songs of thanksgiving and joy resounded, and loud hallelujahs; While on the wings of Winds upraised, the pavilion of splendour Where inscrutable light enveloped the Holy of Holies, Moved, and was borne away, through the empyrean ascending. Beautiful then on its hill appear'd the Celestial City, Soften'd, like evening suns, to a mild and bearable lustre. Beautiful was the ether above; and the sapphire beneath us, Beautiful was its tone, to the dazzled sight as refreshing As the fields with their loveliest green at the coming of summer, When the mind is at ease, and the eye and the heart are contented. Then methought we approach'd the gate. In front of the portal, From a rock where the standard of man's Redemption was planted, Issued the Well of Life, where whosoever would enter, So it was written, must drink, and put away all that is earthly. Earth among its gems, its creations of art and of nature, Offers not aught whereto that marvellous Cross may be liken'd Even in dim similitude, such was its wonderful substance. Pure it was and diaphanous. It had no visible lustre; Yet from It alone whole Heaven was illuminate alway; Day and Night being none in the upper firmament, neither Sun, nor Moon, nor Stars; but from that Cross as a fountain Flow'd the Light uncreated; light all-sufficing, eternal, Light which was, and which is, and which will be, for ever and ever; Light of light, which, if daringly gazed on, would blind an Archangel, Yet the eye of weak man may behold, and beholding is strengthen'd; Yea, while we wander below, opprest with our bodily burthen, And in the shadow of death, this Light is in mercy vouchsafed us, So we seek it with humble heart; and the soul that receives it Hath with it healing and strength, peace, love, and life everlasting. Thither the King drew nigh, and kneeling he drank of the water. Oh what a change was wrought! In the semblance of age he had risen, Such as at last he appear'd, with the traces of time and affliction Deep on his faded form, when the burthen of years was upon him. Oh what a change was wrought! For now the corruptible put on Incorruption; the mortal put off mortality. Rising Rejuvenescent he stood in a glorified body, obnoxious Never again to change, nor to evil and trouble and sorrow, But for eternity form'd, and to bliss everlasting appointed. VIII. THE SOVEREIGNS. Lift up your heads, ye Gates; and ye everlasting Portals, Be ye lift up! For lo! a glorified Monarch approacheth, One who in righteousness reign'd, and religiously govern'd his people. Who are these that await him within? Nassau the Deliverer, Him I knew: and the Stuart, he who, serene in his meekness, Bow'd his anointed head beneath the axe of rebellion, Calm in that insolent hour, and over his fortune triumphant. Queen of the eagle eye, thou too, O matchless Eliza, Excellent Queen, wert there! and thy brother's beautiful spirit; O'er whose innocent head there hover'd a silvery halo, Such as crowns the Saint when his earthly warfare is ended. There too was he of the sable mail, the hero of Cressy, Flower of chivalry, he, in arms and in courtesy peerless. There too his royal sire I saw, magnificent Edward, He who made the English renown, and the fame of his Windsor In the Orient and Occident known, from Tagus to Tigris. Lion-hearted Richard was there, redoubtable warrior, At whose irresistible presence the Saracen trembled; At whose name the Caliph exclaim'd in dismay on Mahommed, Syrian mothers grew pale, and their children were scared into silence. Born in a bloody age, did he in his prowess exulting Run like a meteor his course, and fulfil the service assign'd him, Checking the Mussulman power in the height of its prosperous fortune; But that leonine heart was with virtues humaner ennobled, (Otherwhere else, be sure, his doom had now been appointed,) Friendship, disdain of wrong, and generous feeling redeem'd it, Magnanimity there had its seat, and the love of the Muses. There with the Saxon Kings who founded our laws and our temples, (Gratefully still to be named while these endure in remembrance, They, for the pious work!) I saw the spirit of Alfred; Alfred than whom no Prince with loftier intellect gifted, Nor with a finer soul, nor in virtue more absolute, ever Made a throne twice-hallow'd, and reign'd in the hearts of his people. With him the Worthies were seen who in life partook of his labours, Shared his thoughts, and with him for the weal of posterity travail'd: Some who in cloisters immured, and to painful study devoted Day and night, their patient and innocent lives exhausted, And in meekness possess'd their souls: and some who in battle Put the Raven to flight: and some who intrepid in duty Reach'd the remotest East, or invading the kingdom of Winter, Plough'd with audacious keel the Hyperborean Ocean. I could perceive the joy which fill'd their beatified spirits While of the Georgian age they thought, and the glory of England. IX. THE ELDER WORTHIES. Lift up your heads, ye Gates; and ye everlasting Portals, Be ye lift up! Behold the Worthies are there to receive him, They who in later days, or in elder ages ennobled Britain's dear name. Bede I beheld, who, humble and holy, Shone like a single star, serene in a night of darkness. Bacon also was there, the marvellous Friar; and he who Struck the spark from which the Bohemian kindled his taper; Thence the flame, long and hardly preserved, was to Luther transmitted, Mighty soul, and he lifted his torch, and enlighten'd the nations. Thee too, Father Chaucer! I saw, and delighted to see thee, At whose well undefiled I drank in my youth, and was strengthen'd; With whose mind immortal so oft I have communed, partaking All its manifold moods, and willingly moved at its pleasure. Bearing the palm of martyrdom, Cranmer was there in his meekness, Holy name to be ever revered! And Cecil, whose wisdom 'Stablish'd the Church and State, Eliza's pillar of council. And Shakespeare, who in our hearts for himself hath erected an empire Not to be shaken by Time, nor e'er by another divided. But with what love did I then behold the face of my master, . . Spenser, my master dear! with whom in boyhood I wander'd Through the regions of Faery land, in forest or garden Spending delicious hours, or at tilt and tourney rejoicing; Yea, by the magic of verse enlarged, and translated in spirit, In the World of Romance free denizen I; . . . till awakening, When the spell was dissolved, this real earth and its uses Seem'd to me weary, and stale, and flat. With other emotion Milton's severer shade I saw, and in reverence humbled Gazed on that soul sublime: of passion now as of blindness Heal'd, and no longer here to Kings and to Hierarchs hostile, He was assoil'd from taint of the fatal fruit; and in Eden Not again to be lost, consorted an equal with Angels. Taylor too was there, from whose mind of its treasures redundant Streams of eloquence flow'd, like an inexhaustible fountain: And the victor of Blenheim, alike in all virtues accomplish'd, Public or private, he; the perfect soldier and statesman, England's reproach and her pride; her pride for his noble achievements, Her reproach for the wrongs he endured: And Newton, exalted There above those orbs whose motions from earth he had measured, Through infinity ranging in thought: And Berkeley, angelic Now in substance as soul, that kingdom enjoying where all things Are what they seem, and the good and the beautiful there are eternal. X. THE WORTHIES OF THE GEORGIAN AGE. These with a kindred host of great and illustrious spirits Stood apart, while a train whom nearer duty attracted Through the Gate of Bliss came forth to welcome their Sovereign. Many were they and glorious all. Conspicuous among them Wolfe was seen: And the seaman who fell on the shores of Owhyhee, Leaving a lasting name, to humanity dear as to science: And the mighty musician of Germany, ours by adoption, Who beheld in the King his munificent pupil and patron. Reynolds, with whom began that school of art which hath equall'd Richest Italy's works, and the masterly labours of Belgium, Came in that famous array: and Hogarth, who follow'd no master, Nor by pupil shall e'er be approach'd, alone in his greatness. Reverend in comely mien, of aspect mild and benignant, There, too, Wesley I saw and knew, whose zeal apostolic, Though with error alloy'd, hath on earth its merited honour, As in Heaven its reward. And Mansfield the just and intrepid; Wise Judge, by the craft of the Law ne'er seduced from its purpose; And when the misled multitude raged like the winds in their madness, Not to be moved from his rightful resolves. And Burke I beheld there, Eloquent statesman and sage, who, though late, broke loose from his trammels, Giving then to mankind what party too long had diverted. Here, where wrongs are forgiven, was the injured Hastings beside him: Strong in his high deserts, and in innocence happy, though injured, He, in his good old age, outlived persecution and malice. Even where he had stood a mark for the arrows of slander, He had his triumph at last, when moved with one feeling, the Senate Rose in respect at his sight, and atoned for the sin of their fathers. Cowper, thy lovely spirit was there, by death disenchanted From that heavy spell which had bound it in sorrow and darkness, Thou wert there, in the kingdom of peace and of light everlasting. Nelson also was there in the kingdom of peace, though his calling While upon earth he dwelt, was to war and the work of destruction. Not in him had that aweful ministry deaden'd, or weaken'd Quick compassion, and feelings that raise while they soften our nature. Wise in counsel, and steady in purpose, and rapid in action, Never thought of self from the course of his duty seduced him, Never doubt of the issue unworthily warpt his intention. Long shall his memory live, and while his example is cherish'd, From the Queen of the Seas, the sceptre shall never be wrested. XI. THE YOUNG SPIRITS. Ye whom I leave unnamed, ye other Worthies of Britain, Lights of the Georgian age, . . . for ye are many and noble, How might I name ye all, whom I saw in this glorious vision? . . . Pardon ye the imperfect tale! Yet some I beheld there, Whom should I pretermit, my heart might rightly upbraid me, That its tribute of honour, poor though it be, was withholden. Somewhat apart they came, in fellowship gather'd together, As in goodly array they follow'd the train of the Worthies. Chosen spirits were these, of the finest elements temper'd, And embodied on earth in mortality's purest texture; But in the morning of hope, in the blossom of virtue and genius, They were cut down by death. What then, . . were it wise to lament them, Seeing the mind bears with it its wealth, and the soul its affections? What we sow, we shall reap; and the seeds whereof earth is not worthy Strike their roots in a kindlier soil, and ripen to harvest. Here were the gallant youths of high heroic aspiring, Who, so fate had allow'd, with the martial renown of their country Would have wedded their names, for perpetual honour united; Strong of heart and of mind, but in undistinguishing battle, Or by pestilence stricken, they fell, unknown and confounded With the common dead. Oh! many are they who were worthy, Under the Red Cross flag, to have wielded the thunders of Britain, Making her justice felt, and her proper power upholding Upon all seas and shores, wheresoever her rights were offended, Followers of Nelson's path, and the glorious career of the Wellesley. Many are they, whose bones beneath the billows have whiten'd, Or in foreign earth they have moulder'd, hastily cover'd, In some wide and general grave. Here also were spirits To have guided, like Cecil of old, the councils of England; Or, like Canning, have silenced and charm'd a tumultuous Senate, When to the height of his theme, the consummate Orator rising, Makes our Catalines pale, and rejoices the friends of their country. Others came in that goodly band whom benigner fortune Led into pleasanter ways on earth: the children of Science Some, whose unerring pursuit would, but for death, have extended O'er the unknown and material, Man's intellectual empire, Such their intuitive power; like Davy, disarming destruction When it moves on the vapour; or him, who discovering the secret Of the dark and ebullient abyss, with the fire of Vesuvius Arm'd the chemist's hand: well then might Eleusinian Ceres Yield to him, from whom the seas and the mountains conceal'd not Nature's mystery, hid in their depths. Here lost in their promise And prime, were the children of Art, who should else have deliver'd Works and undying names to grateful posterity's keeping, Such as Haydon will leave on earth; and he who, returning Rich in praise to his native shores, hath left a remembrance Long to be honour'd and loved on the banks of Thames and of Tiber: So may America, prizing in time the worth she possesses, Give to that hand free scope, and boast hereafter of Allston. Here too, early lost and deplored, were the youths whom the Muses Mark'd for themselves at birth, and with dews from Castalia sprinkled: Chatterton first, (for not to his affectionate spirit Could the act of madness innate for guilt be accounted:) Marvellous boy, whose antique songs and unhappy story Shall, by gentle hearts, be in mournful memory cherish'd Long as thy ancient towers endure, and the rocks of St. Vincent, Bristol! my birth-place dear. What though I have chosen a dwelling Far away, and my grave shall not be found by the stranger Under thy sacred care, nathless in love and in duty Still am I bound to thee, and by many a deep recollection! City of elder days, I know how largely I owe thee; Nor least for the hope and the strength that I gather'd in boyhood, While on Chatterton musing, I fancied his spirit was with me In the haunts which he loved upon earth. 'Twas a joy in my vision When I beheld his face... And here was the youth of Loch Leven, Nipt, like an April flower, that opens its leaves to the sunshine, While the breath of the East prevails. And Russell and Bampfylde, Bright emanations they! And the Poet, whose songs of childhood Trent and the groves of Clifton heard; not alone by the Muses But by the Virtues loved, his soul in its youthful aspirings Sought the Holy Hill, and his thirst was for Siloa's waters. Was I deceived by desire, or, Henry, indeed did thy spirit Know me, and meet my look, and smile like a friend at the meeting? XII. THE MEETING. Lift up your heads, ye Gates; and ye everlasting Portals, Be ye lift up! Behold the splendent train of the Worthies Halt; and with quicker pace a happy company issues Forth from the Gate of Bliss: the Parents, the Children, and Consort, Come to welcome in Heaven the Son, the Father, and Husband! Hour of perfect joy that o'erpays all earthly affliction; Yea, and the thought whereof supporteth the soul in its anguish! There came England's blossom of hope, . . the beautiful Princess; She in whose wedded bliss all hearts rejoiced, and whose death-bell, Heard from tower to tower through the island, carried a sorrow, Felt by all like a private grief, which, sleeping or waking, Will not be shaken away; but possesses the soul and disturbs it. There was our late-lost Queen, the nation's example of virtue; In whose presence vice was not seen, nor the face of dishonour, Pure in heart, and spotless in life, and secret in bounty, Queen, and Mother, and Wife unreproved... The gentle Amelia Stretch'd her arms to her father there, in tenderness shedding Tears, such as Angels weep. That hand was toward him extended Whose last pressure he could not bear, when merciful Nature, As o'er her dying bed he bent in severest anguish, Laid on his senses a weight, and suspended the sorrow for ever. He hath recover'd her now: all, all that was lost is restored him; . . Hour of perfect bliss that o'erpays all earthly affliction! They are met where Change is not known, nor Sorrow, nor Parting. Death is subdued, and the Grave, which conquers all, hath been conquer'd. When I beheld them meet, the desire of my soul overcame me; And when with harp and voice the loud hosannahs of welcome Fill'd the rejoicing sky, as the happy company enter'd Through the everlasting Gates; I, too, press'd forward to enter: . . . But the weight of the body withheld me. I stoopt to the fountain, Eager to drink thereof, and to put away all that was earthly. Darkness came over me then at the chilling touch of the water, And my feet methought sunk, and I fell precipitate. Starting, Then I awoke, and beheld the mountains in twilight before me, Dark and distinct; and instead of the rapturous sound of hosannahs, Heard the bell from the tower, toll! toll! thro' the silence of evening.</field>
