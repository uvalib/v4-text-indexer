      <field name="fulltext">Famine: A MASQUE THE MASQUERS Famine Blight The Locust Manito Waste War Trade Death and Sin Chorus of Labourers The Night is cold: a Cry is heard in the air. Where? O where?â Where are they who bring Hunger in? Which of you will the dance begin? Blight, that spoilest the ripening corn! Locusts, that make the green earth lorn! Waste, that tramplest down the fruit! War, that dost the corn uproot!â Ye who herald Hunger! hear Our call to you: appear! appear! A formless Shadow creeps in through the mist: Like a black shroud scorch'd by fire. Hist! hist! I come From the fields where the whisper of hope is dumb, Where the birds forget to sing; I pinch'd every germ with finger and thumb, And the charr'd remains I bringâ My Hunger-offering. Darkness and the rustling of multitudinous wings: As the darkness passes off a shrill Voice sings:â We are the myriad-winged race! We alight on the first green place, And we strip the leaves and the juicy shoots And ruin the fruits And efface every fruitful trace: Famine! we pray thy grace. Famine! Famine! we have sped: The buffaloes out on the plains lie dead, Too many to count, a goodly sight For the lover of mere brute misery! We had stay'd to see, But thy call wing'd our flight To Thee. A King enters, in a palanquin carried on the shoulders of naked slaves:â Above, below, without, within, The earth is mine. These have their graves, While I dine off a kingdom or quaff my wine Of great vineyards with blood manured. What matter how is procured My pleasure? Am I not King? Are not my names Arrogance, Greed, and Waste? What traitor dare bring His basket of blames? Lo! I eat: let the famish'd be glad! I am clad In the purple,âthey are but dust: As the dust in my path when I haste In my lust To devour and to waste. Clangour of trumpets: War rushes in, driving a chariot arm'd with scythes. Amidst the din my voice shall yet be heard. Let Blight and Hunger's winged hordes and Waste Collect their tithes; But haste! My claim preferr'd, all they have left I take. And with a rake, Stirring what Fear conceals, Want follows at my wheels Through the red slush and mud To slake Her thirst, in blood. Song of the Four Famine! Greatest of the Powers! We bring here ourselves and ours: At thy feet to lay These our records of obstruction, These our tokens of destruction, For thy holiday. Blight Mildew I am, the forerunner of Death. The Manito of the Locusts No green thing grows my shadow underneath. Waste My wantonness tramples on all you left. War The orts from the open mouth I reft. Blight They have sown, they have planted,âI hinder'd the growth. Locust Spirit When the harvest was promised I came,â Like a flame I devour'd. Waste I more than you both Have consumed, and had never a care. War My name is Despair. Who will sow With War for his foe? All Famine! we are here, each one To stand underneath thy throne Bearer of a corner stone Of the sepulchre whereon We would have thee sit supreme, Leaving us the task to make Human hope a starveling's dream For thy name's sake. Death, the Skeleton, rides in on the pale horse; Sin on a pillion behind. A rush of wind. Then FAMINE, a living corse, with hollow cheeks, is borne in on a shield (the device an empty field), on the uplifted hands of Skeletons, an army following. She stands and speaks. Ye all have done your utmost: but alone Had not succeeded. Wherefore ye are blamed. Why is my Mightiest One unnamed? Weak are Grasshoppers and Blight; Waste and War may be ashamed: Ye ministers to my delight? Ye servants worthy me? Know I not what each hath done? Finish'd, ye have scarce begun. On the trail of Blight I follow'd fast, For I knew that it could not last: The desert, barren and drear, Will blossom again next year. When the Grasshoppers disappear They come not for years again; The corn crowds the prairies, the deer Hide in herds in the clover, The birds sing over The golden miles of grain. O, ye devour in vain; And Waste's swift car and the scythes of War Leave but a scar. Lo! the earth is now at peace, And the locusts are no more; Autumn's days will have surcease Ere they garner all the store Of this year's harvest. Yet see! see! Worshipers crowd unto meâ Crowding in their thousands:âSee! Where is He Who alone hath made me sure? God of the unstarved Poor! appear! We wait for thee. TRADE, the hundred-arm'd, comes on an iron car drawn by women: on his breast a star. Trade I am who giveth to the labourer food!â Without me were not work, nor life, nor good. Who marshaleth the labourers' force but I? Who sets their tasks? What other can supply Their daily bread when the mill-race is dry And Blight and War and Locusts hover nigh? My capital, well saved and well employ'd, Maintains the poor fool Labour, else destroy'd By reckless ignorance and folly. Why Am I, the poor man's help, his bounteous lord, Who give much more than I can well afford, Class'd thus with these Abhorr'd? What have I done? Are not my hands clean? and the smell of gold Is it not pleasant? And my hair is white With wintry years. For I am very old, And little hath this world for my delight.Famine Well phrased, BelovÃ¨d One! But hear what others say! Thou art too modest â not thy usual way. What ho, my worshipers devout! attend! Welcome the Skeletons' Friend! Tell out his well-earn'd pay!â Sing! sing to the Spoiler The hymn your pain wringeth, The hymn Despair singeth, The Song of the Toiler! Honour the Master Dealer in clammin'! Thy husband, Disaster! Provider of Famine, World-ruling Trade. Honour the jackal, The blood-hound of Want! When work is slack, all The worse for the Gaunt, Wages unpaid. Laud him, Applauder! Him of the close fist; Hymn the wise hoarder! Hymn the Economist, Genius of gain! Praise him who filleth With folly his warerooms! Praise him who killeth His workers, in bare rooms Prison'd and slain! Surely he hateth Communist dreamers: While the world waiteth Yet for Redeemers, Silver hath he: Counteth his pieces, His thirty per cent; Counteth his fleeces, Centuples his rent, Earth holds in fee. Praise him who hinders Division of good: Peddler of cinders, Destroyer of food, Hirer of Death! Praise him who playeth With Death as a doll! Praise him who slayeth, And slaying takes toll Of his victim's last breath! Fatten him, labour! With coin in his purse; Let pipe and tabor Keep close to his hearse; Pray for his soul! So wise a reaper May well own the soil; Surely thy keeper, Cain's brother, call'd Toil! Thy life may controul. Work when he chooseth! Starve when he biddeth! Tools that he useth Rightly he riddeth Him of, his work done. Heap him with blessing, This God of the Ages! Hope no redressing, But scantier wages As the years run! His â pick and shovel, His â axe and ploughshare, Hammer and trowel, Shop-gear and house-ware, His the machine; His â the red vintage, Harvest and profit, His â the percentage, Usury of it Counted between: Traffic's great highways, Gold-room, exchanges, Labour's least byeways, All he arranges, Ruleth like Doom. Born when he liketh, Bred as he orders, Die when he striketh! There in Want's borders Dig thy cheap tomb!Semichorus I We have toil'd, we have striven: Our horn'd hands have riven The rocks of the primeval world: We split them with fingers of iron; We rent them, we burst them asunder, Loud-roaring like thunder, As if heaven's fire on Their flanks had been hurl'd. Like beasts were we driven To labour, from labour returning; Within us was burning The sting of the goad: The scourge in our flesh, in our hearts, Deeper churning, the sting of the goad. Our scarr'd backs were raw With the scourge and the goad And the weight of our load, Making bricks without straw. Semichorus II In the sweat of thy brow and with pain Shalt thou labour and till the earth: Gaining nought from the sun or the rain Till thy service compelleth worth. In the red sweat of hope and with pain Shalt thou dig, and assort the seed, That the earth may bring forth right grain: And thy scourge shall be need. For the days of that first Paradise are not: Life-pleasure grows no more in idle living. Man's hard lot Is in the thorny wilderness, where he must win By long endeavour,â Nature nothing giving Except to Strength, Strength able to begin With craft and with endurance to persist, Holding with firm-closed fist Each handful of his patient gathering. Chorus Sing! sing! O sing! For the Curse is beneath our feet: Though our gain be incomplete. We have tamed the untamed Force; We have ridden him as a horse, And with Thought as a rein Have bridled him, never again To wander at will. From the loftiest sill Of walls Cyclopean to the Future shout! Tell how we builded, what our hands have wrought! Sing out! sing out! To the farthest ends of time, O Javan of the Isles! and Tubal heaven-taught, The first Artificer! Who now is skill'd to o'erreach our works sublime? Did not we build Thy towers, O Seba! on the Cushite shore; Chaldean Ur and Erech too,â before We aim'd for Nimrod, aiming (so we will'd) Above his arrows? Later Nineveh We moulded; and yet later Babylon. By our strong hands the earth-mounds were upthrown In the Great Valley 'neath the Western slopes; Thy water-ways, thy roads, Peru! we made And temples buried now in many a forest glade. Force, where to-day enfranchised Science gropes, Then push'd his simpler way, And lifted trophies vast to amaze the latest day. Semichorus I Day by day we toil and moil and die: Day after day Unrestingly We pour our lives away; And all our pay Scarce buyeth oil to soothe our agony Of wounds: the goad-thrust in the side, The holes in our feet. To us they have denied The vinegar with the gall. The wine Of life we taste not. And those things divine, Which some have seen in dreams, we never know: Outwearied long ago, And sleeping so the weary sleep of death. And thy long arms, Machinery! (Envying our little breath Of the free air are they who invoke thy power) Reach for the fateful hour Of surer misery. Semichorus II Hope liveth yet. The murderers have set Their seal upon the sepulchre in vain: The Master-Builder's secret was not known To them,â to him alone Intrusted who but waits to raise the Slain. Steam's hands Briarean,â they may rob you now, But shall work for you, earning your release From brutefying toils! Lift up thy brow, Bright with intelligence, and welcome Peace, Worn Bond-Slave of the Present! See thy slave In each new mechanism: slave and saviour too! Ye Toilers! welcome powers that human labour save: Whose savings shall be counted out in interest to you. Chorus Lift, O lift up your heads, ye Industrious! Lift your sad eyes unto heaven! Surely you are the Illustrious: Yours the true yeast that must leaven Life's bread. And the wine of the Cup You shall drink â as the Priest. Are ye last? Yet not least! Shall not you be redeem'd from your sorrow? From you the glad tiding, The dawn-light, the pledge of To-morrow, What shadow is hiding? Is a man but a beastâ (And yet muzzled) To plough and to tread out the corn; Then unstabled, forlorn, To be shut from the feast? Lift up your heads, O ye Toilers! Look forth, through the Present; Look over the heads of the Spoilers: See where the horizon is pleasant! Lo, Winter departs, and the Spring Of the Earth and of Man with sweet voices Welcomes the glory from heaven, Welcomes the glad Hours that bring A new God to the earth: It is Work that rejoices, The human God â Worth. Many a long year have our heavy pinions, Sing the Destinies (have ye not ears to hear them?) Watchful, stoop'd above the dull dominions Of earth's Anarchs: if you did not fear them, O men! all your chains even now were broken. But the time draws nearer, nearer, nearer, When the Destinies themselves unchain you, When the tyrant crouches to his fearer, Giving him the sceptre and the reinâYou Shall know it by this token, though you now despond. Across the huddled clouds where Famine standeth See the Rainbow in its double splendour! The Storm's sign of surrender Unto Him who Gloom and Light commandeth. Who is it that demandeth sight beyond? So!âLook thou forth, and see The Doom of the Risen Workman in the wide realms of the Free! Then I saw the Future, as a map unroll'd before me: Homes of jewel'd beauty in a ring of golden meadows, Orchards, and sweet gardens; and a joy broke o'er me As when sunlight leapeth athwart tempest-shadows. Over corn-fill'd valleys, over clear swift-gliding rivers, Hover winged songsters, echoing yet gladder singing: Peasant nobles', work-ennobled, a new world's bread givers, To the land's great markets for exchange all produce bringing; Bringing it unbidden to the wisely order'd centres And all goods there leaving, the storekeepers hiving, folding, For whoso requireth: unto whom the buyer enters Without fear of fraud or any gainfuller withholding. One at his own homestead planteth or in far emprizes Seeketh out new action for a later hope's redeeming. â So before my eyes the Vision of the Future rises: When the world awakens from its desultory dreaming. Famine Not while Trade lives!â Your dreams are but sieves Which the Spring-flood prophetic falls through. Expect ye some Saviour's aid? Your Saviour, Trade, has departed from you. Trade was sent to feed the Nations, To give all at least some rations In worst times of scarcity. Lo! I fear'd the Deluge ending As I saw above me bending In the brightening sky Thy arch, Prosperity! The rainbow of the Free. But the youthful Saviour met me In the desert of ambition; Upon the granite heights he set me, Where I promised him â perdition. Ere this God of Wealth be clamming, Dying for a meal of gold, While he waits the assurÃ¨d damning For him destined from of old, Honour him as ye do me! Semichorus I We hail thee with curses, O Trade! Thou hast made God's earth as the Potters' Field, Where Hope and Effort, the powers that wield Axe and plough and spade and hammer, Are sepulchred: the clamour Of their volcanic anguish rends the world, Cursing, as we too curse thee, O Misrule! Semichorus II The Destinies have hurl'd Defiance at thee: yet, thou Fool! Thou settlest tariffs; holdest, loosest Toil; And rakÃ¨st in thy spoil; Nor hear'st the steps Titanic Of One who cometh, heedest not though he Shouts to thee threateningly, again, again. How often shall he warn, in vain? Thy master â Panic. Chorus Guerdon for thee, Great Genius of our time! Anarch sublime! Everywhere groweth good: thou dost provide; Thou dost distribute,â to thy knaves rank food, To the producers bones or hide. Thou addest field to field, and in thy granaries Forestallest corn, to rot. Across the seas thy argosies Pass to and fro, but not with blessings for mankind. For this, and more, we judge thee, Giant blind!â For thou hast choked increase with lies and fraud, For thou hast made of hope a merchandize, For thou hast robb'd the labourer of his hire, For thou hast defiled our wives at thy desire, For thou hast driven our children through the fire In sacrifice to the Abhorr'd: For these things do we laud thy name And with acclaim Greet thee as Rapine â Desolation's Lord, And pray that Famine yield thee her so fit reward. Famine Now, when you have taken breath, Our high revels may begin.â Reel of Famine, Trade, and Sin. Then follows the Dance of Death.</field>
