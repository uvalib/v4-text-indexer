LAMBETH PALACE 306 Jhesu Criste ou[r]e Savyour And his moder, Ã¾at swete ffloure, Spede hem at her nede That lysteneth of a conquerour, Wise of witt and a wight wereour A[nd] doughty man of dede. His name was Sir Gyngelayne, Gotten he was of Sir Gaweyne, Vnder a forest syde; A better knyght was neuer prophitable With Arthur at the Roun Table: Herde J neuer of redde. Gyngelayne was fayre of sight, Gentyll of body and of face bryght, Bastard though that he were; His moder hym kept[e] with hir myght That he shulde se no knyght J-armed in no maner, For he was full [savage] And gladly wold [do] oute-rage To his ffellaves in fere; And all for dred of wycke loose His moder alwey kept[e] him close As dughty childe and dere. And for he was so fayre of ffyce, His moder clept[e] him Bewfi?, And none oÃ¾er name, And this childe was so nyse He asked neuer, j-wysse, Whate hight [off] his dame. Tyll hit be-fell vppon a day, The childe wente him forthe to playe, Off dere to haue som game; He fond a knyght Ã¾ere he lay, Jn armes stoute and gaye, Slayne and made ful tame. He toke of that knyghtis wede; Hym-sylffe Ã¾erin well fayre [c]an shrede, All in that bryght armour. Whan he had do that in dede, To Glastynbury Ã¾e childe him yede, Ther lay Kyng Arthure. And whan he came to Arthurs hall He fond him there and his lordis all; This childe knelyd downe on his kne: âKyng Arthure, Criste Ã¾e saue and see! J am come oute of fer contre My mone to make to the. J am a childe vnkowthe And come out of the southe And wolde be made a knyght; Lorde, J pray the nowthe, With thi mery mouthe, To graunte me anone right.â Than saide Arthure the kynge, âTo me childe, with-out dwellinge: Whate is thi name aplight? For neuer sethe J was born, Sawe J neuer me be-forne So semely to my sight.â Sayde Gyngelayn, âBe Seint Jame! J ne wote whate is my name: J am the more nyse; But while J was at home, My moder, on hir game, Clepped me Bewfice.â Than sayde Arthur the kyng, âThis is a wonder thinge, Be God and Seint Denyce, [Whan] Ã¾at [he] wold be made a knyght And wote not whate his name h[e]ght And hathe so fayre a vice. J shall if hym a name, Amonge you all in [s]ame, For he is fayre and fre; Be God and be Seint Jame, So clepped him neuer his dame, Whate woman so she be. Clepeth him in your vse, Lybeus Disconeus, For the loue of me; Than mowe ye wit, on a rowe, That the better ye mowe knowe Certis so hight hee.â Kynge Arthur anone right [C]on make him a knyght, Jn that sylffe daye. âNow Kyng Arthur haÃ¾e made me knyght, J thanke him with all my myght; Bothe by day and nyght With my fomen J will fight Them to say with strok[e] of myght And to juste in feer.âThe last three lines of this stanza are taken from ms. Cotton Caligula A. II, as they are not present in the Lambeth ms. And hym be-tok hys fadyr Gaweyn For-to teche hym on Ã¾e playn Of ech kny?tes play. Whan he was a knyght made, Off Arthur a bone he bade And sayde, âMy lorde fre: Jn hert J were full glad The first fyghtinge Ã¾at ye hadde That men will aske of the.â Than saide Arthur Ã¾e kynge, âJ graunte the thine askynge, Whate batayll so it bee; But me thinkeÃ¾ Ã¾u arte to yonge To do a gode ffyghtynge, Be ought that J can see.â With-outen eny more reyson, Duke, erle and baron Wesshed and went to mete. Volatyle and venyson, As lordis of grete renon, J-now they had to ete. Nade Arthure syt but a while, The mountence of a myle, Att his tabyll [sett], The[r] con a mayde in ryde And a dwerffe by hir syde, All be-swett for hete. The may hight Ell[y]ne, Gentyll, bryght and shene: A lovely messengere. Ther nas countes nor quene So semely on to sene That myght be hir pere. She was clothed in tarse, Rownd and nothinge scarse, J-pured with blawndenere; Hir sadill was ovir-gilt And with diamondis ffyltt: Milke white was hir destere. The dwerff was cloÃ¾ed in ynde, By-fore and eke be-hinde: Stoute he was and pertte. Amongis all Cristyn kyng Suche sholde no man fynde; Hi[s] surcote was so ryche bete. His berde was yelewe as wax, To his girdyll hange his fax: The sothe to say in sertente. Off gold his shone were dight And coped as a knyght: That signyfied no povert. Theodeley was his name: Wyde [wher] spronge his fame, By northe and eke by southe; Mekyll he couthe of game, Sotill, sawtrye in same, Harpe, fethill and crowthe. He was a gentill boourdour Amonge ladyes in boure: A mery man of mouthe. He spake to the mayde hende, âFor-to tell thine erende, Tyme hit were nouthe.â The mayde knelyd in hall Be-for the knyghtis all And sayde, âMy lorde Arthur, A casse is nowe beffall, A worsse with-in wall Was neuer yitt of doloure: Mi lady of Synadowne Js brought in stronge prison, That was of grete valure, And pray you sond hir a knyght That is of wer wyse and wight, To wynne hir with honoure.â Vppe startte that yonge knyght, With her[t] mery and light, And sayde, âArthur my lorde, J shall do that fight And wyn that lady with myght, Jf ye be trewe of worde.â Than sayde Arthoure, âÃat is sothe, Certeyn with-outen othe, Therto J ber recorde. God yf the strenthe and myght To holde that ladyes right With dynte of sper and swerde.â The mayde be-gan to chide And sayde, âAlas that tyde That J was heder j-sentt! Thy worde shall sprynge wide: For-lorne is thy pryde And thi lose shentt, When thou wilt send a childe That is witles and wylde To dele eny doughty dent, And haste knyghtis of renon: Syr Persyfale and Syr Gawyn, That ben abled in turment.â The dwerffe with grete erroure Went to Kynge Arthowre And saide, âKynde kynge: This childe to be weroure And to do suche labour Js not worthe a fferthinge! Or that he that lady see, He shall do bataylles thre, Wyth-oute eny lesynge; At Poynte Perilowse, Be-syde the Chapell of Awntrous, Shall be his begynynge.â Syr Lybeus than answerde, âYett was J neuer a-ferde For dred of wordys awe. To fyght with spere and swerde Somdell haue J [lerned], Ther many man hathe be slawe. That man that fleyth by wey or strete, J wolde the devyll had broke his nek, Wher-euer he hym take; Also J wolde he were to-drawe And with the wyne to-wawe, Till the devill him take. The batayll J vndir-take And neuer none for-sake, As hit is londis lawe.â The kynge said anone right, âThou ge[t]tist here none oÃ¾er knyght, By Him that bought me dere! Jff ye thinke the childe not wyght, Get the anoÃ¾er wher thou myght, That is of more power.â The mayden for jre and hete Wolde neyÃ¾er drynke ne ete, For none that there were; She sate downe dismay[de] Tyll the table was raysed, She and the dwerffe in fere. Kyng Arthour, in that stounde, Comaunded of the Tabill Rownde Foure of the best knyghtis, Jn armys hole and sownde, To arme him anone rightis; And sayde, âThrowe Ã¾e helpe of Criste, That in the fflome was baptiste, He shall holde vppe all his hight[is], And be gode champyon To the lady of Synadon And fellen hir foon in fyght[is].â To armen him Ã¾e knyghtis were fayne: The fyrst was Syr Gawayne, That oÃ¾ere, Syr Persyuale, The third was Syr Jwayne, The fourthe highte Agfayne: Thus telleth the Frensshe tale. They kestyn on him of sylke A sorkett white as mylke, That semely was in sale; Ther-on an haubryk bryght That richely was dyght With mayles thik and smale. Syr Gawyn, his owe syre, Henge abo[u]te his swyre A shelde with one chefferon; And an helme of riche atyre That was stele and none jre Sir Percyvale sett on his crowne; Lawncelett brought him a spere, Jn armes him with to were, And a fell fa[u]chone; Jwayne brought him a stede That was gode at nede And egir as eny lyon. The knyght to hors gan sprynge And rode to Arthure the kynge And sayde, âMy lorde hende: Yeff me thy blessynge, With-oute eny dwellynge: My will is nowe to wende.â Arthur his honde vp-haffe And his blessyng him yaffe, As curteys kynge and kynde, And sayde, âGod yf the grace, Off spede and eke of space, To brynge that byrde oute of bonde.â The messanger was sto[u]te and gaye And leppt[e] on her palfraye; The dwerffe rode by hir syde. Tyll on the thirde day, On that knyght alwaye Faste he gan to chide; And saide, âLorell, cayty[ff]e, Though Ã¾u were worÃ¾e suche fyve, Lorne is thy pryde! This place be-forne kepith a knyght That wit[he ee]che man will fight: His wordis spryngen full wyde. He hat Syr William Delara[u]nche: His ffyght may no man staunche, He is a werreour oute of wytt; Throwe herte oÃ¾er throwe haunche, His spere he will throwe launche Whoso agayne hym sytt.â Quod Lybeous Disconeous, âJs his fyght of suche vse, Was he neuer j-hitt? For ought that may betyde, Ayenes him will J ride To se how he will sytte!â They redyn forthe all thre Vpon that fayre cause Ryght to Chapell Auntours; The knyght they con see, Jn armys bryght of blee, Vppon the Poynte Perylous. He bare a shelde of grene With iij lyons of gold shene: Well proude and precious; Off sute lynnell and trappes: To dele strokys and rappes That knyght was evyr vyous. Whan he sawe Lybeous with syght Agayne him he rode right And sayde, âWell-come bewfere! Whoso ridi[s] here day or nyght He most nedys with me fight Or leven his armes here.â Quod Lybeous Disconeus, âFor the loue of Jhesus, Lett vs nowe passe here: We be fer from any frende And have wylde wey to wende, J and this mayden in fere.â William answerd thoo, âThowe shalt not scape soo, So God yf me rest! We shall bothe twoo Fyght or than we goo, A forlonge here be weste.â Quod Lybeus, âNowe Y see Hit will no[n] oÃ¾er bee: J[n] haste do thi best. Take thi course with thi shafte, Jff Ã¾u conne thy crafte, For here is myne all prest.â They wolde no lenger abyde, But to-geder con Ã¾ey ryde With well grete raundon. Lybeus Disconeus that tide Smote William vnder the syde With a sper ffelloune; But Will[iam] sate so faste That bothe his styropis to-brast And his hynder arsoune, That he be-gann to stoupe Ouer his hors crowpe, And in the felde fell downe. His stede ranne away, But William nought longe laye But stertt vp anone ryght And sayde, âBe my faye! Nevyr a-for this daye Ne fonde J none so wyght. My stede is nowe a-goo: Sir, ffyght on fote also, Yff thou be a gentyll knyght.â Sayde Libeus Disconeus, âBy the leue of Jhesus, Ther-to J am full lyght.â To-geder con they dynge And ffauchones oute to flynge And faughten ffrely faste. Dyntis con they dynge That fyre, with-oute lesynge, From helme and basnett oute-braste; But Wylliam Sellabraunche To Lybeus con launche Through his shelde on highe. The last three lines of this stanza are taken from ms. Cotton Caligula A. II, as they are not present in the Lambeth ms. A kantell fell to grounde: Lybeau, Ã¾at ylke stounde, Jn hys herte hyt kaste. Lybeus anone ryght Deffended him with myght, As werreor queynte and slygh; Barbe and crest in syght He made to fle downe ryght Off Williams helme on highe; And with the poynte of the swerde He shove Williams berde And came the fflesshe not nyghe. William smote to Lybeus soo That his swerd barst a-two, That many a man hit sy?e. Tho can William to crye, âFor the loue of Mary, On lyve now lett me passe! Hit were a grete vylonye To do a knyght to dye, Wepenles in a pla[s]se.â Quod Lybeus Disconeus, âBy the l[ou]e of Jhesus, Off lyfe gettest Ã¾u no grace But Ã¾u swere me an othe Or than ye hense gothe, Right be-for my face. Jn haste knele downe And swere on my ffauchon Thou shalt to Artor wende And say, âLord of renon, As ouer-come person, A knyght me heder ganne sende, That ye cleppen in your vse Lybeus Disconeus, Vnkothe of right and k[y]nde.ââ William on kneis him sett And swore, as he hym hett, Her fo[r]ward worde and ende. Thus they departed all: William to Arthours hall Toke the right waye. A case ther can be-fall: Thre prynces proude in palle He met that ylke daye.

Of Ã¾ese kny?tes Ã¾re, HarkeneÃ¾, lordynges fre, A ferly fayr fy?tynge! Ãey armede hem full well Yn yren and yn stel, Wyth-out ony dwellyng, And leptede on stedes sterne And after gon y-erne To sle Ã¾at kny?t so yenge. Her-of wyst no wyght Syr Lybeus that yonge knyght, But rode forthe pase by pase. He and that mayden bright Made to-geder that nyght Gamen and grete solas. Mercy she con hym crye For she had spoken hym vylonye: He for-yaue hir that trespas. The dwerff was hir squyer And serued hem bothe in fere Off alle that worthi was. On morowe, whan it was daye, They redyn on her jornaye Taward Synadon. Then met they in the way Thre knyghtis stoute and gaye, Rydynge from Carboun. To hym they cryed aright: âTraytor, torne agayne and fight, Or leve here thi rennoun! For here we westward wende Thyne haubrek we shall rende: Ther-to we bethe ffull bounde.â Syr Lybeus to hem cryed, âJ am redy to ride Ayenes you all in same!â As prince prouude in pride, He prekyd his stede on eche syde And to them stoutly con r[e]de On ernest and nought in game. The eldest broÃ¾er can bere To Sir Lybeus a spere: Gower was his name; Lybeus rode Gower so n[e]gh[e] That he to-brake Gowers thiegh, And evyr after was lame. The knyght gronyd for payne; Lybeous, with myght and mayne, Held hym fast adowne. The dwerffe of Theodoleyn Toke the stede by the rayne And lepte vp in the arson, And rode forthe, also skette, Ther the mayde Elyne sette That faire was of ffassyon; Than loughe this mayden bright And seide that this yonge knyght Js chose for champyon. The medyllest broÃ¾ere be-helde How his brother in the felde Had lorne bothe mayne and myght; He smote, as it is tolde, Syr Lybeous in the shelde With his spere full right. The shafte a-two did brest, The hede steked faste Jn place ther hit was pight; Lybeous than can ber With the poynte of his spere The helme awey of the knyght. The yongest broÃ¾er ffull yerne Vpon a stede full sterne As egir as eny lyon, Hym thought his body can bren But he myght, also yern[e], Ber Lybeous downe. As werour oute of witt Lybeous on the helme he hit With a ffell fauchon; So styffe a stroke he set[t], Throwe helme and basnet[t], Hit clave in Lybeous crowne. Tho wax Lybeous agreved When he felte on his hed[e] The swerde with egir mode; His bronde aboute he wende: All that he hit he shende, Als[e] werreour wilde and wode. Full fast men saide tho[o], âA man agaynes two, To fyght is nothinge gode!â Harde he hewe on him, And he, with strokys grym[e], Styfly ayenes him stode. But throwe Godis grace, That oÃ¾er brother he canne brace Vnder his right arme tho[o]; He threwe him in that place And in that selfe space His lyfte arme brast atwo[o]. The yongest say with sight That he ne had mayne n[o] myght To fyght agaynes his foo; To Lybeous vp he helde His spere and eke his shelde And mercy cryed hym thoo. Lybeous answerd, âNaye, Thou ascapest not so away, By Hym that holpe mankynde! Thou and thi breÃ¾eren tweyne Shull plight me your fayne Ye shullen to Artor wende; And sey, âLord of renon, As ouer-come [of] persoune, A knyght me hedyr can sende: To yelde you toure and towne And dwell in your bawndon, Ever with-oute ende.â And but ye will so doo, Certis, J will you sloo, Longe or hit be nyght.â The knyghtis sworne two They shulde to Arthur goo, Her trowythe ther they plight. Lybeus and that may Rydden in her jornaye Ther they haden tight. Tyll that the ther[d] day They reden in game and playe, He and that mayden bryght. They reden even weste Jn-to the wilde forest Taward Synadoun; They nuste whate hem was best: Taken they wolde fayne reste And myght not come to tow[n]e. Jn the grene greves Thei dight a loge of leves, With swerdys bryght and brow[n]e; There-in they dwelled al nyght, He and that mayden bright, That was of fayre fassyon. And evyr the dwerff cann wake That nothinge shulde be-take Her[e] hors aweye with gyle. For dred he ganne quake: Grete ffyre he sawe make, Thensse halfe a myle. âAryse, sir,â he sayde, âknyght! To hors that ye were dight, For dred of more perile; Certis, J h[i]re boste And fele grete smylle of roste, Be God and be Seint Gyle!â Lybeous was stoute and fayre And lepte vpon his desteyre And hent shelde and spere, And whan that he ny?hed nere, As he rode tawarde the f[y]re, Two gyauntes he sawe there. That one was rede and lothelych, That oÃ¾er black as eny pyche: Gressly bothe of chere! The black helde in his arme A mayde j-clypped in his barme: So bryght as blossom on brere. The rede giaunte full yerne A wylde bore canne torne Aboute apon a spytt. The fyre bright can bren, The mayde cryed yerne For some man shuld it wit, And sayde euer, âWayle-a-waye! That euer J shulde bide this daye With two devylles to sitt! Helppe me, Mary mylde, For love of thine childe, That J be nought for-yett!â Than Lybeous: âBe Seint Jame! To saue this maiden from shame, Hit were enpure enpri[c]e; But for-to fight with bothe in same, Hit is no childes game: They be so grym and gryse!â He toke his course with a shafte, As knyght of kynde crafte, And rode be right assyse. The blacke giaunte can to smertt Thorugh lounge and hert, That neuer after cann rysse. Tho flye the mayden shene And thanked tho heven quene That suche socoure hir sentt; Tho came the mayde Ele[yn], She and the dwarffe by-dene, And by the hande hir hentte, And lad hir in-to the greves, Jn-to the loge of levys, With well gode entent, And be-sought swete Jhesus Helpe Lybeus Disconeus That he ne[r] nought shent. The rede gyaunte smote thore To Sir Lybeous withe the bore As wolfe oute off wede. His dynnte he smote so sore That Lybeous stede th[o]re-for Downe to grownde yede. Lybeous was redy bounde And lepte on his arson As sparkyll dothe on glede; With hartt egyr as a lyon, He faught with his fauchon To quyte the gyaunte his mede. Euer the gyaunte ffaught[e], But at the secunde draught His spere barst evyn a-twoo; As man that was vnsawght A tronchon oute he laught[e] To fyght agaynes his foo, And with the hede of the tre He smote Lybeous shelde in thre: Than was Lybeous woo. As he his tronchon vp-haffe, Syr Lybeous a stroke him gaffe: His right arme fell hym froo. The gyaunte fell to grownde: Syr Lybeous, in that stownde, Smote of his hede full right. Jn Frensshe as it is j-ffounde, He that he gave the fyrste wounde, He servyd hym so aplyght. And then toke the hedis two And bare the mayden thoo, For whom he made that ffyght; The mayde was glade and blythe And thanked God ffele sythe That euer he was made knyght. Quod Lybeous, âGentil dame, Tell me whate is thi name And where ye were y-bore.â âSyr,â she sayde, âbe Seynt John, My ffader is of riche fame And wonnes yonder be-forne: An erle, an olde hore knyght, That hathe ben man of myght: His name is Syr Anctour.

Fayre walled hit was with stone: Suche sawe he neuer none, With cornyllus styff and stoute. Sayd Lybeous, âBe Seynt John!

Than sayde all that ther weren That Jeffroun had j-lorne The gentill jerfaukon; To Lybeous they hym bare And went, bothe lesse and more, With hym in-to the towne. Geffroun oute of the felde Was borne home on his shelde With care and reuthefull row[n]e; The gerfaukon j-sent was By a knyght that hight Cadas To Arthur, kynge with crowne.

But yf thow the racche levyn, Thowe pleyest, longe or evyn, A wondyr wilde game!â Qu[o]d Lybeous, also prest, âTher-of, sir, do thy beste: The rache with me shall wende.â Thay token her way evyn west Jn-to that faire forest, As the [d]werff he[m] kende. Syr Otis, with grete errour, Rode home to his toure And after his frendis did send; And tolde hem anone right[is] Howe one of Arthur is knyghtis So shamefully canne him shende; And his racche was j-nome. Than sware they, all and some, That traytur shulde ben j-take And neuer ayene home come, Though he were the grymmer grome Than Launcelet de Lake. They dighten hem to armes With swerdys and gi?arnes, As werre that shulde awake. Knyghtis and squyers Leppyn on her desters, For her lordis sake. Vpon an hill full hie Syr Lybeous ther he seye, Rydinge forthe pase by pase. To hym they con crye, âTraytor, thou shalt die, To-daye for thye trespace!â Lybeus ayene be-helde Howe full was the felde, So mekyll folke that ther was; He sayde, âMayde Ellyne, For this racche, Y wene, Me cometh a carefull case. J rede ye you with-drawe To the wode shawe, Youre hedis for-to hide; For Y am frely fayne, Though Y shulde be slayne, Bekyr with hem to abyde.â Jn-to the fforest he rode And ther he boldly abode. As avauntors proude in pryde, With bowes and arblast, They shotten to him faste And made hym woundis wyde. Syr Lybeous stede ranne And bare downe hors and man, For nothinge wolde he spare. All men sayde than, âThis is the devyll Satan, That mankynde will forfare.â For whomso Lybeous araught At his fyrst drawght, He slepte for euer-more; But sone he was be-sette, As dere is in the nette, With grymly woundis sore. For xij knyghtis, all prest, He sawe come oute of the west, Jn armys bryght and clere. Alday thay haden y-rest And thoughtyn in that fforest To slee Lybeous that knyght. Off sewte they weren all twelue, That one was the lorde him-selue, Jn ryme to redyn a-right. They smotyn to hym at onys And thoughten to breke his bonys And to fellyn hym in ffyght. Tho myght men hire dynge And rounde rappis rynge, Amonges hem all in ffeere: The sparkylles conne to-sprynge, Forthe withe-oute lesynge, From sheld and helmes clere. Lybeous slowe of hem three, The fourthe be-gon to flee And durste nought ne?e him nere. The lorde lefte in the stoure And his sonnes foure, To syllen her lyves dere. Tho runne rappes ryffe: He one agaynes fyve Faughte as he were wode. Nye downe they con hym dryve; So watyr dothe of the skythe, Off hym ranne the bloode. Whan Lybeous was ney spilte, His swerde barst in the hilte: Than was he madde of mode. The lord a stroke he sete Throwe helme and basnett, That in the skolle hit stode. Jn swounynge he fel downe Vpon his ferther arsoune, As man that was all mate. His fone weren full bownde To persyne his aketowne, Bothe mayle and plate. When he ganne sore to smerte, He pulled vp his herte And sterryd vp his state; An ax he hente him nyghe, That henge by his thighe: Almost him thought to late. Tho he steryd him as a knyght: Thre stedis adowne right He slowe at strokys three. The lorde sawe that in sight And of his stede he alyght: Away he began to fflee. Lybeous no lenger abode But aftyr hym he rode; Vnder a chesteyne tree Ther he hadde him qwelled, But that the lorde hym yelde At his will for-to bee, And, by certeyne stente, Tresure, londe and rentte, Castell, hall and boure: Lybeous therto assente, By forward so that he wente Vnto Kynge Arthure And sayde, âLorde of renowne, As ouer-come and prisowne, J am to thine honowre.â The lorde graunted his wille, Bothe lowde and stylle, And ladde him to his toure. Anone the mayden Ellyne With gentill-men fyftene Was j-fett to the castell. She and the dwerffe bydene Tolden all the dedis kene Off Lybeous howe it be-fell: And whiche persones foure He sent to Kynge Arthure, That he wanne fayre and wele. The lord was well blythe And thanked fele sythe God and Seint Michell That swyche a nobyll knyght Shulde with werre in fyght Wynne his lady ffree. To covere with mayne and myght, Lybeous a fourtenyght Ther with him canne lende. He did helen his wounde And made hym hole and sownde By the fowrtenyght ende; Than Lybeous and that maye Toke her right waye To Synadon to wende. The lorde, with-oute dwellynge, Went to Arthur the kynge And for presowne hym yelde, And tolde him the begynnynge Howe suche a knyght in ffyghtyng Wan hym in the ffelde. Kynge Arthur had gode game And so had alle in same That herde that tale y-tolde; And chosyn hym prophytable Knyght of the Rounde Table, To ffyght with spere and shelde. Nowe rest we here a while Of Sir Otys de Lyle And tell we forthe oure talis, Howe Lybeous rode many a myle And sey awntours the while And Jrlande and in Walys. Hytt be-fell in June, Y wene, Whan ffenell hangeth al grene Abowte in semely saale; The somerys day is longe, Mery is the ffowlis songe And notis of the nyghtyngale. That tyme Lybeous canne ryde Be a reueres syde And sawe a fayre cite With palys prowde in pryde And castelles high and wyde And gates grete plente. He axed whate hit hight; The mayden sayde anone right, âSyr, J will telle the: Men clepeth this Jl de Ore, Here be fightis more: Ther is werr in euery countre. For a lady of price, Roddy as rose on rice, This contre is in dowte; A gyaunt that heght Maugys, Nowhere his pere is, Hir hathe be-sett aboute. He is as blacke as pyche, Nowher is none suche Off dedis sterne and stowte; Whate knyght so passyth the bryge His armys he moste downe legge And to the gyaunte alowte. He is thirty fote on leynthe And myche more of strenthe Than other knyghtis fyve; Syr Lybeous, woll be-thynke the That thou with him ne macched bee: He is gryme to discryue. He berreth on euery browe As it were brystillus of a sowe; His hede grete as an hyve, His armys the lenthe of an elle, His fystis arne full felle Dyntys with to dryve.â Quod Lybeous, âMayden hynde, My way nowe will Y wende For alle his strokys ylle. Jff God will me grace sende, Or this day come to ende With fight Y hoppe hym fell. J haue sene grete okys Fallyn with wyndes and strokys, And the lytell stande full stille. Thoughe that Y be litell, To hym will J smyte, Let God do his wylle!â They roden forthe all three Tawarde that fayre cite That men calleth Jle Dolour. Maugys they con see Vpon a bryge of tree, Bolde as a wilde bore. His shelde was blacke as pycche, And all his armour suche: Thre mawmentis ther-in were, Off gold gayly gilte; A spere in honde he helde And his childe him be-fore. He kryede to hym in spyte, âSey, thou ffellave in white, Tell me whate arte thowe! Torne home ayene tite, For thyne owne prophite, Yf thow lovyst thy prowe.â Lybeous sayde anone right, âKynge Arthure made me knyght, To hym Y made avowe That J shulde neuer turne my backe; Therfor, thow devyll black, Make the redy nowe!â Syr Lybeus and Maugis On stedis proude in prise To-geder redyn full ryght. Bothe lordis and ladyes Laynen in her toures For-to se that syght; And praied to God bothe lowde and stille, Yff it were his swete wille, Save that Crysten knyght, And that ffyle gyawnte That levyd on Turmagaunte, This day to dye in fighte. Her shaftes borsten on sonder, Her dyntis ferd as thonder: The pecis canne of-sprynge. Euche man had wonder That Lybeous ne had gon vnder At the fyrste begynnynge. They drewe swerdis bothe As men that were wrothe And gonne to-gedir dynge; Sir Lybeous smote Maugis soo That his shelde fell him froo And in the [f]elde canne flynge. Maugis was qweynt and qwede And smote Lybeous stede on the hede And dasshid oute the brayne; The stede fell downe dede, Syr Lybeous nought sayde But stertt hym vp agayne; And an ax hent y-bowne That henge by his arsowne And stroke to hym with mayne Through Maugis stede swyre: He for-karve bone and lyre That the hede fell in the playne. On fote bothe they fyghte, Discryven no man myght The strokys be-twis hem two; Bothe woundes they laughte, For they were vnsaught And eiÃ¾er other is foo. From the oure of pryme Tyll hit were evensonge tyme, To fyghtyn they were throo. Sir Lybeous thrested soore And sayde, âMaugis, thine ore! To drinke thou lett me goo. And Y shall graunte the Whate bone thowe aske of me, Swiche case if the be-tide; For grete shame hit wolde be A knyght for thurste to slee, And no maner parfyte.â Maugis graunted his will To drynke all his fille, With-oute more dispite. As he lay on the banke And throw his helme dranke, Maugis smertly hym smytte That in the reuer he fylle: His armoure euery dele Was wette and evill y-dight; But vp he sterte as snelle And seyd, âBe Seint Michell, Nowe am Y two so light! Weneste thou, fendys fere, Vncristened that Y were Tylle Y sawe the with sight? J shall for this baptyse Quyte well thi service, Thorough grace of God almyght!â Then newe fyght by-ganne: Eyther to other ranne And deltyn dyntes strange; Well many a gentilman And ladyes as white as swanne For Lybeous her hondys wrange; For Maugis in the felde For-karffe Lybeous shelde Thorough dynte of armes longe. Than Lybeous ranne awaye There Maugis shelde laye And vp he gan hit fange. And ran agayne to hym; With strokys sharpe and gryme Eyther other ganne assayle. Till the day was dymme Vpon the watir brym By-twene hem was bataylle. Lybeous was werreour wight And smote a stroke of myght Thorowe jepowne, plate and mayle, Thorowe the shulderbone That his right arme anone Fell in the felde, saunce fayle. The gyaunte this ganne see, That he shulde slayne bee: He ffledde with myght and mayne. Syr Lybeous after ganne tee With sterne strokys thre He smote his backe on twayne. The gyaunte ther belevyde; Syr Lybeous smote of his heved: There-of he was fayne. He bare the hede in-to the towne; With a fayre processyoune The folke come hym agayne. A lady bright as floure, That men calleth la Dame Amoure, Resseyued him wele and fayre And thanked hym with honour That he was hir socoure Agayne that giaunte file. To chambyr she him ledys And did of all his wedis And clothed hym in palle, And profirde him with worde For-to be hir lorde Off cite and castell. Lybeous graunted hir in haste And loue to hir ganne caste, For she was bright and shene. Alas she hadde be chaaste! For euer at the laste She dyde hym traye and tene. For xij monthes and more As Lybeous dwelled thore He for-gate mayde Elyne, That neuer he myght oute-breke For-to helpe to awreke Off Synadowne the qwene. For the faire lady Cowthe more of sorcerye Than other suche fyve; She made hym suche melodye Off all maner mynstralsye That any man myght discryue. Whan he sawe hir face Hym thought that he was Jn paradice on lyve; With false lies and fayre Th[u]s she blered his eye: Evill mote she thryue! Till it be-fell vpon a daye He mete Elyne that may Be-side that castell toure; To hym than ganne she saye, âKnyght, thou arte false in this laye Ageynes Kynge Arthure! For the love of o woman That mekyll of sorcery canne Thow doste the grete dissehonour: My lady of Synadowne May longe lye in preson, And that is grete doloure!â Syr Lybeus herde hir speke; Hym thought his hert gan breke For sorowe and for shame. At a postren j-steke There he ga[nn]e oute-breke Fro that gentyll dame, And toke with hym his stede, His shelde, his jren wede, And reden forthe all in same. Hir stywarde stoute and ffayre He made his squyer: Jurflete was his name. They rodyn ffaste as they maye Forthe on her jornaye On stedis baye and browne; Till on the third daye They saue a cite gaye: Men clepen hit Synadowne; With castelles high and wide And palysed proude in pryde, Worke of fayre ffacion; But Lybeous Disconyous Had wonder of that vse That he saye men do in towne. Cor and fenne full faste, That men hade ere oute-caste, They gadered ynne j-wysse. Syr Lybeous axid in haste, âTell me, mayden chaste, Whate be-tokeneth this? They taken in the goore That ar was oute y-boore: Me thynketh they do amysse.â Than seyd mayde Ellyne, âSyr knyght, with-oute wene, J tell the whate hit is. No knyght, for nesshe ne harde, Though he shulde be for-ffarde, Getteth here none ostell, For doute of the stywarde That hight Syr Lanwarde, Constable of that castelle. Go ryde in-to the castell gate And axe thine jnne ther-atte, Bothe fayre and wele; And ere he do thi nede, Off justis he will the bede, Be God and be Seint Michell! And yf he beryth the downe His trumpetis shall be bowne Her bemes high to blowe; Then ouer all Synadowne Bothe mayde and garson This fen on the to thorowe. To whiche lond that yowe wende, Euer to youre lyves ende, For kowarde thou worthe knowe; And thus may Kynge Arthure Lesyn his honoure For thyn dedis slowe.â Quod Lybeous als tite, âThat were a foule disspyte For any knyght on lyue! To do Arthure prop[h]yte And maketh that lady quyte Thedyr will Y dryve. Syr Gyrflete, make the yare, To juste with Ã¾e will not spare, Hastely and blyue.â They reden forthe at the gate Right to the castell yate, With faire shaftis fyve. And axed ther ostell At that fayre castell For auntors knyghtis; The porter faire and wele Lete hym yn full snell And axed him anone rightis Who was here gouernours; And they seid, âKynge Arthure, Man of moste myght[is]; Well of curtaysie And ffloure of chevalrye To ffellen his fone in fight[is].â The porter prophitable To his lorde the constable Sone this tale tolde; And sayde, âWith-oute fable, Syre, of the Rowne Table Ar comen two knyghtis bolde; That one is armyd full seuere Jn roose rede armoure With thre lyons of goolde.â The lord was glad and blythe And sayde, also swythe, Justyn with hym he wolde. And bade hem make hem yare Jn-to the felde to fare, With-oute the castell gate. The porter wolde not spare: As a g[r]eyhounde dothe to an hare To hem ranne to the gate And sayde anone rightis, âYe auntrous knyghtis, For nothinge ye latte: Looke your sheldis be stronge And your shaftis longe, Soketys and vaumplate, And rydeth in-to the felde: My lord, with shafte and shelde, Will with you playe.â Sir Lybeous spake wordis bolde: âThat is a tale y-tolde Lykyng to my paye!â Jn-to the felde they rode And boldly ther abode As bestis brought to baye. Lambard sent his stede, His shelde, his jren wede: His tire was stoute and gaye. His shelde was asure fyne, Thre beer hedis ther-jnne As blacke as bronde y-brent; The bordure of ermyne: Was none so quaynte a gynne Fro Carlile in-to Kentt; And of that silfe peyntoure Was surcott and trappoure, Jn worlde wher-so he went. Thre squiers by hym ryde, Thre shaftis thei bare him myde To dele with doughty dynte. Tho that stoute stywarde, That hight Sir Lancharde, Was armed to the ryghtis, He rode to the ffelde-warde As it were a lebarde, And ther abode thes knyghtis. He sette his shelde in grate: Almoste hym thought to late When he hym sei?e with sight[is]. Lybeous rode to hym thare With a shafte all square, As man of moste myght[is]. Ayther smote oÃ¾er in the shelde That the peces flowen in the felde, Sothe with-oute wene; Euche man to other tolde, Bothe yonge and olde, âThis yonge knyght is kene!â Lambarte his cours oute-right As werour oute of wytte, For jre and herte tene, And sayde, âBrynge me a shafte; Yff this knyght con his crafte, Right sone hit shall be sene!â Tho toke the[y] shaftis rownde With cornelys sharpe y-grownde And reden with grete raundon. Eyther provyd that stownde To gyve other dethes wounde, With herte eger as a lyon. Lambarte smote Lybeous soo That his shylde fell him ffroo And in the ffelde fell adowne: So harde he hym hitte That vnnethis he myght sytte Vpryght in his arsoune. His schafte brake with power; Lybeous smote hym in the laynore On his helme so bryght: Pesawe, ventayle and gorger Fly forthe withe the helme so clere, And Sir Lambarde vp-right Sate and rocked in his sadylle As a childe in his cradill, With-outen mayne and myght. Euery man toke othir by the lappe And low?en and couthe her handis clappe: Barowne, burgeys and knyght. Syr Lambartt thought to juste bett: AnoÃ¾er helme hym was y-fett And a shafte vn-mete, And wan they to-geder mette Eythir to other his shelde sette Strokys grysly and grete. Syr Lambartis shafte to-braste, And Lybeous shoved soo faste, Jn sadylles ther they sete, That the constable, Sir Lambertt, Felte ouer his hors backwarde, With-oute more be-yete. Syr Lamberd was ashamed sore; Qu[o]d Sir Lybeous, âWilt thou more?â And he answerd, âNaye! Sethe the tyme that Y was borne Sawe J neuer me be-forne So rydynge to my paye. Be my trouthe my herte is thine: Thowe arte of Sir Gawynes kynne, That is so stoute and gaye. Yf thou shalt for my lady ffyght, Welcome to me this nyght Jn sekyr and trouthe in faye!â Lybeous sayd, âSekerlye, Fyght Y shall for thy ladye, By heste of Kynge Arthure; But Y ne wote wherfor ne whye, Ne who dothe hyr that tormentrye, To brynge hir in dolour; A mayde that was hir messanger And a dwerff brought me here, Her to socoure.â Lambarde sayde at that stownde, âWelcome, knyght of the Table Rownde, Be God and Seint Saueour!â And the mayden Elyne Was sen for with knyghtis kene By-for Sir Lambarde. She and the dwarffe by-dene Tolde of the dedis kene That he did thedirwarde, And how that Sir Lybeous Faught with fele shrewes And hem nothinge spared. Tho were they all blythe And thanked God fele sythe, God and Seint Leonarde. Anone with mylde chere They sett hym to sopere With mekell gle and game. Lybeous and Lambard y-ffere Off auentours that ther were Talkeden bothe in same. Lybeous, with-oute ffable, Seyd, âSir constable, Whate is the knyghtis name That holdeth in prisoune That lady of Synadon, That is gentyll a dame.â Quod Lambert, âBe Seint John! Knyght, sir, is ther none That durste hir away lede: Twoo clerkys ben hir foone, Fekyll off bloode and bone, That hauyth y-doo this dede. They ar men of mynstrye, Clyrkys of nigermansye, Here arte for-to rede. Jrayne ys that o brother And Mabon is that other, For whome we ar in dred. Jran and that Mabon Haue made in this towne A paleys queynte of gynne: Ther nys erle nor baroun That bereth hert as a lyon, That durst come ther-in. Hit is by nygrymauncye J-wrought with ffayreye, That wondir hit is to wynne; Therin lyeth in presowne My lady of Synadon, That is of knyghtis kynne. Oftyn we hire hir crye: To sene hir withe none eye, Ther-to haue we no myght. They do hir torment[ry]e And all the velenye And dreche hir day and nyght. This Mabon and Yrayne Haue sworne her othe certayne To dethe they will hir dight, But she graunte hem tyll To do Mabones will And yeven him hi[r] right. Off all this kyngdome fayre Than is my lady ayre, To wel[d]e all with wynne. She is meke and bonoure, Therfor we ar in spere Luste they done hir synne.â Quod Lybeous Disconyous, âBy the love of Jhesus, That lady shall Y wynne: Bothe Mabon and Jrayne J shall hewen in the playne The hedys by the chynne.â Tho was no-more tale J[n] the castell, grete and smale, But [s]ouped and made hym blythe. Baronys and burgeyses fale Comyn to that semely sale For-to listen and lithe Howe Sir Lambert had wrought And yf the knyght were oughte, His crafte for-to kythe. They fownden hem sette in fere And talkynge at her sopere Of knyghtis stoute and stythe. Tho toke they ease and reste And lykynges of the beste Jn the castell that nyght. On morowe was Lybeous prest Off armes of the best: Full ffresshe he was to fight. Lambarde lad him that gate To the castell yate And fonde it full vp-right. Further durste hym none brynge, Forsothe with-oute lesynge, Barowne, burgeys ne knyght. But turned home agayne, Save Sir Jerflete his swayne Wolde with hym ryde. Lybeous swore, certayne, That he wolde see his brayne Yf he wolde lenger abyde. To the castell he rode And with Lambard abode, To Jhesus than they cryed He shulde hem send tidyngis glad Of hem that longe hadde Distroyed ther welthes wide. Syr Lybeous, knyght curtays, Rode in-to the paleys And at the hall he alight; Trumpys, hornys, sarvysse, Right by-for that highe deys, He herde and saughe with sight, And amydd the hall floore A ffyre well starke and store That tente and brende bright. Ferther in he yede And toke with hym his stede, That halpe him in his ffyght. Lybeous jnner ganne passe To be-holde that place: The halys in the halle; Off men more nor lasse Ne sawe he body nor fface Butt mynstralis cladde in palle. With harpe, lute and roote And orgone noyse of note, Grete gle they maden all; With sotill and sawtery, Suche maner mynstralsye Was neuer with-in wall. By-for euche mynstrale stode A torche bothe fayre and gode, J-tende and brente bright. Sir Lybeous jnner yode To witten with egir mode Who shulde with hym fight. He yede in-to the corners To be-holde the pilleres That semely was of sight. Off jasper and of fyne cristale, J-fflorysshed with amyall, That was of moche myght. The dores weren of brasse, The wondowes all of glasse, Wrought with jmagerye; The halle y-peynted was: Nowher none fayrer nas That he hade seyne withe eye. He sett hym on the deys: The mynst[r]ales weryn in pees, That were so tryste and trye; The torchis that brent bright They queynte anone right: The mynstrellys weren awaye. The dorres and wyndowes all They betten in the hall As hit were dynte of thonder; The stones of the walle On hym conne they falle, And ther-off had he wonder. The deys be-gan to shake, The erthe be-gan to quake; As he sate ther-vnder, The halle roofe vnlyke And the vasure eke, As it wolde all in sonder. As he sate thus dismayed, He holde hym-selfe dysseyved, Sertis, herde he ny?e; Thoo he was better apayde And to hym-selfe sayde, âYett Y hope to playe!â He loked in-to the felde And sawe, with spere and shelde, Men in armes twayne, Jn pured pure armoure Was lyngell and trappure, Wyth golde gaylye dight. That one rode in-to the hall And by-ganne for-to call, âSyr knyght auntours! Suche case is nowe be-ffall, They thou be knyght in palle Fyght thou moste with vs! J holde the qwaynte of gynne And thou that lady wynne That is so precious.â Quod Lybeous anone ryght, âFresshe Y am to ffight, By the helpe of Jhesus!â Syr Lybeous with gode will And in-to his sadyll gan skylle, A launce in honde he hente, And titely rode hem tyll: His fomen for-to felle, Suche was his talent. Whanne thaye to-geder smete, Vpon her shelde hit sette, With sperys doughtely of dynte; Mabounes launce to-braste, Tho was he sore agaste And helde hym shamely shent. And with that stroke ffellowne Syr Lybeous bare Maboune Ouere his hors tayle; For his hynder arson Brake and fell adawne Jn-to the felde saunce fayle; And neygh he had him slayne, But there come Sir Jrayne, Jn helme, hawbrek of mayle; So ffresshe he was to ffight, He thought anone righte Syr Lybeous to assaylle. Syr Lybeous was of hym ware, A spere to hym he bare And lefte his brother stille; Suche a dynte he yaue thare That his haumbryk to-tare: That liked Jrayne ylle. He[r] lawnses they borsten a-two, Her swerdys they drewen thoo, With hert grym and grylle; They con to-geder fight, Eyther provid with right Other for-to spyll. As they to-gedyr gan hewe, Maboune, the more shrewe, Jn ffelde vp aroos; He herde and well knewe That Jrayne yaue dyntis fewe: Ther-of hym sore agroos. To hym he went full right To helpe to fellen in fight Lybeous of noble loose; But Lybeous faught with bothe, Though they weren wrothe, And kepte hym-selffe close. Tho Yran sawe Maboune He smote strokys fellon To Sir Lybeous withe jre That evyn he karfe a-downe, By-for his forther arsowne, Lybeous stedys swyre. Lybeous was werreour sly?e And smote evyn to his thi?e: He karfe bone and lyre; Ne halpe hym not his armour, His chawntementis ne his chambur: Dow[n]e ffell that sory syre. Lybeous of his hors alight With Mabone for-to fight, Jn ffelde bothe in feere. Swyche strokys they dight That sparkelys sprongen downe right From shelde and helmes clere; As they bothe to-geder smytte, Her bothe swerdys mette: As ye may se hem bere. Mabon, the more shreweos, For-karffe the swerde of Sir Lybeous Attweyne quyte and skere. Tho was Lybeous asshamed And in his harte sore agramed, For he had lorne his swerde, And his stede was lamed And he shulde be defamed To Arthur kynge his lorde. To Yrayne swythe he ranne And hente his swerde vp thanne: Was sharpe on eche a syde; And ranne to Maboune right And faste they gonne to fight: Off love was ther no woorde! But evyr faught Maboune As hit were a lyoune Sir Lybeous for-to sloo; But Lybeous karffe adowne His shilde with his fawchon, That he toke Jrayne ffroo. Jn the right tale y-tolde The lyfte arme with the shelde Awaye he smote alsoo; Than cryed Mabon hym tyll: âThi strokys arne full ylle; Gentill knyght nowe hoo! Ay will yelde me to the, Jn love and grete laughte, At thine owne wille, And that lady ffre That is in my powste Takyn Y will the tille. For thorough the swerdis dynt My honde Y haue j-tynte: The venym will me spille; J venymed hem bothe, Certeyn with-outen othe, Ther-with oure fone to felle.â Quod Lybeous, âBe my thryfte, J will nought of thi yefte, For all this worlde to wynne; But lay on strokys swyfte: One of vs shall other lefte The hede by the chynne!â Tho Mabon and Lybeous Faste to-geder hewes And slaked not for no synne; Lybeous was more of myght: He clove his helme downe right And his hede atwynne. Tho Mabon was slayne He ranne ther was Yrayne With a fawchoune in his fiste; For-to cleue his brayne: J tell you for certayne, To fight more hym lyste! But whan he come there, Away he was y-bore: Jn-to whate stede he nuste. Tho sought he hym for the nonys Wyde in all the wonys: Jn trewthe well he truste. And whan he fonde him noughte He helde him-selfe be-kaughte And by-ganne to syke sore, And seide, in worde and thought, âThis will be dere bought That he is fro me fare! He will with sorcerye Do me tormentrye: That is my moste care.â Sore he sate and sighte, He nuste whate do he myght, He was of blysse all bare. As he sate thus in halle, Oute at a stone walle A wyndowe fayre vnfelde; Grete wondyr with-all Jn his herte ganne falle And he sate and be-helde. A worme ther ganne oute-pas With a womanes face: âYonge Y am and nothinge olde.â Hir body and hir wyngis Shone in all [Ã¾]ynchis, As amell gaye and gilte. Hir tayle was mekyll vnnethe, Hir peynis gryme and grete, As ye may listen and lere. Syr Lybeous swelt for swete There he sate in his sete, As alle had ben in fyre; So sore he was agaste Hym thought his herte to-braste As she neyhid hym nere. And ere that Lybeous wiste, The worme with mouth him kyste And clypped aboute the swyre. And aftyr this kyssynge Off the worme tayle and wynge Swyftly fell hir froo: So fayre, of all thinke, Woman, with-oute lesynge, Sawe he neuer ere thoo; But she was moder naked, As God had hir maked: The[r]for was Lybeous woo. She sayde, âKnyght gentyll, God yelde the thi wille My foon thou woldest sloo! Thowe haste slayne nowthe Two clerkys kowthe, That wroughten by the fende.

To the castell Lybeous rode, Ther-for the folke abode And be-ganne to crye. Syr Lybeous to Lambard tolde And to oÃ¾er knyghtis bolde Howe he hem thre ganne gye, And how Mabon was slayne And wounded was Jrayne, Thorowe myght of Marye. And howe her lady bright To a dragon was y-dight, Thorowe her chawnterye, And thorow the c[o]sse of a knyght Woman she was aplight, A comly creature: âBut she stode be-fore, As naked as she was bore, And sayde, âNowe am Y sure My fone thou haste slayne, Mabon and Yrayne: Jn pees thou dost me brynge.ââ When Lybeous Disconyous Had tolde the stywarde thus, Bothe worde and endeng, A robe of purpyll riche, Pillured with pure grice, He sent hir on hyenge; Kerchewes and garlandis ryche He sent hir preveliche, A byrd hit ganne hir bringe; Whan she was redy dight She went with many a knyght To hir owne wonnynge. All the folke of Synadowne With a well fayre procession Her lady conne home brynge. When she was comen to towne, Off gold and stonys a crowne Vpon hir hede was sett, And were gladde and blythe And thanked God fele sythe That hir balys were bett.
