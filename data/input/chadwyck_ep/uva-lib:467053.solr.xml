      <field name="fulltext">[VOLUME I] PART I. POEMS OF YOUTH AND EARLY MANHOOD. MY BROTHER'S GRAVE. Beneath the chancel's hallow'd stone, Exposed to every rustic tread, To few, save rustic mourners, known, My brother, is thy lowly bed. Few words, upon the rough stone graven, Thy nameâthy birthâthy youth declareâ Thy innocenceâthy hopes of Heavenâ In simplest phrase recorded there. No 'scutcheons shine, no banners wave, In mockery, o'er my brother's grave. The place is silentârarely sound Is heard those ancient walls around; Nor mirthful voice of friends that meet Discoursing in the public street, Nor hum of business dull and loud, Nor murmur of the passing crowd, Nor soldier's drum, nor trumpet's swell From neighbouring fort or citadel,â No sound of human toil or strife To death's lone dwelling speaks of life; Nor breaks the silence, still and deep, Where thou, beneath thy burial stone, Art laid âin that unstartled sleep The living eye hath never known.â The lonely sexton's footstep falls In dismal echoes on the walls, As, slowly pacing through the aisle, He sweeps the unholy dust away, And cobwebs, which must not defile Those windows on the Sabbath day; And, passing through the central nave, Treads lightly on my brother's grave. But when the sweet-toned Sabbath chime, Pouring its music on the breeze, Proclaims the well-known holy time Of prayer, and thanks, and bended knees; When rustic crowds devoutly meet, And lips and hearts to God are given, And souls enjoy oblivion sweet Of earthly ills, in thoughts of Heaven; What voice of calm and solemn tone Is heard above thy burial stone? What form, in priestly meek array, Beside the altar kneels to pray? What holy hands are lifted up To bless the sacramental cup? Full well I know that reverend form, And if a voice could reach the dead, Those tones would reach thee, though the worm, My brother, makes thy heart his bed; That Sire, who thy existence gave, Now stands beside thy lowly grave. It is not long since thou wert wont Within these sacred walls to kneel; This altar, that baptismal font, These stones which now thy dust conceal, The sweet tones of the Sabbath bell, Were holiest objects to thy soul; On these thy spirit loved to dwell, Untainted by the world's control. My brother, those were happy days, When thou and I were children yet; How fondly memory still surveys Those scenes the heart can ne'er forget! My soul was then, as thine is now, Unstain'd by sin, unstung by pain; Peace smiled on each unclouded browâ Mine ne'er will be so calm again. How blithely then we hail'd the ray Which usher'd in the Sabbath day! How lightly then our footsteps trod Yon pathway to the house of God! For souls, in which no dark offence Hath sullied childhood's innocence, Best meet the pure and hallow'd shrine, Which guiltier bosoms own divine. I feel not now as then I felt, The sunshine of my heart is o'er; The spirit now is changed which dwelt Within me, in the days before. But thou wert snatch'd, my brother, hence, In all thy guileless innocence; One Sabbath saw thee bend the knee In reverential pietyâ For childish faults forgiveness craveâ The next beam'd brightly on thy grave. The crowd, of which thou late wert one, Now throng'd across thy burial stone; Rude footsteps trampled on the spot Where thou lay'st mould'ring and forgot; And some few gentler bosoms wept In silence, where my brother slept. I stood not by thy fev'rish bed, I look'd not on thy glazing eye, Nor gently lull'd thy aching head, Nor view'd thy dying agony: I felt not what my parents felt, The doubtâthe terrorâthe distressâ Nor vainly for my brother kneltâ My soul was spared that wretchedness, One sentence told me, in a breath, My brother's illnessâand his death! And days of mourning glided by, And brought me back my gaiety; For soon in childhood's wayward heart Doth crush'd affection cease to smart. Again I join'd the sportive crowd Of boyish playmates, wild and loud; I learnt to view with careless eye My sable garb of misery; No more I wept my brother's lot, His image was almost forgot; And ev'ry deeper shade of pain Had vanish'd from my soul again. The well-known morn I used to greet With boyhood's joy at length was beaming, And thoughts of home and raptures sweet, In every eye but mine, were gleaming; But I, amidst that youthful band Of beating hearts and beaming eyes, Nor smiled nor spoke at joy's command, Nor felt those wonted ecstasies: I loved my home, but trembled now To view my father's alter'd brow; I fear'd to meet my mother's eye, And hear her voice of agony; I fear'd to view my native spot, Where he who loved itânow was not. The pleasures of my home were fledâ My brother slumber'd with the dead. I drew near to my father's gateâ No smiling faces met me nowâ I enter'dâall was desolateâ Grief sat upon my mother's brow: I heard her as she kiss'd me, sigh, A tear stood in my father's eye; My little brothers round me press'd, In gay unthinking childhood bless'd. Long, long that hour has pass'd, but when Shall I forget its mournful scene? The Sabbath cameâwith mournful pace I sought my brother's burial placeâ That shrine, which when I last had view'd, In vigour by my side he stood. I gazed around with fearful eyeâ All things reposed in sanctity. I reach'd the chancelânought was changedâ The altar decently arrangedâ The pure white cloth above the shrineâ The consecrated bread and wineâ All was the sameâI found no trace Of sorrow in that holy place. One hurried glance I downward gaveâ My foot was on my brother's grave! And years have pass'd and thou art now Forgotten in thy silent tomb; And cheerful is my mother's brow, My father's eye has lost its gloom; And years have pass'd, and death has laid Another victim by thy side; With thee he roams, an infant shade, But not more pure than thou he died. Blest are ye both! your ashes rest Beside the spot ye loved the best; And that dear home, which saw your birth, O'erlooks you in your bed of earth. But who can tell what blissful shore Your angel spirits wander o'er? And who can tell what raptures high Now bless your immortality? My boyish days are nearly gone, My breast is not unsullied now; And worldly cares and woes will soon Cut their deep furrows on my browâ And life will take a darker hue From ills my brother never knew. And I have made me bosom friends, And loved and link'd my heart with others; But who with mine his spirit blends, As mine was blended with my brother's? When years of rapture glided by, The spring of life's unclouded weather, Our souls were knit, and thou and I, My brother, grew in love together. The chain is broke which bound us thenâ When shall I find its like again? 1816. TO ? In many a strain of grief and joy, My youthful spirit sung to thee; But I am now no more a boy, And there's a gulf 'twixt thee and me. Time on my brow has set his sealâ I start to find myself a man, And know that I no more shall feel As only boyhood's spirit can. And now I bid a long adieu To thoughts that held my heart in thrall, To cherish'd dreams of brightest hue, And theeâthe brightest dream of all. My footsteps rove not where they roved, My home is changed, and, one by one, The âold, familiarâ forms I loved Are faded from my pathâand gone. I launch into life's stormy main, And 'tis with tearsâbut not of sorrow, That, pouring thus my parting strain, I bid thee, as a Bride, good-morrow. Full well thou know'st I envy not The heart it is thy choice to share: My soul dwells on thee, as a thought With which no earthly wishes are. I love thee as I love the star, The gentle star that smiles at Even, That melts into my heart from far, And leads my wandering thoughts to Heaven. 'Twould break my soul's divinest dream With meaner love to mingle thee; 'Twould dim the most unearthly beam Thy form sheds o'er my memory. It is my joy, it is my pride To picture thee in bliss divine; A happy and an honour'd bride, Blest by a fonder love than mine. Be thou to one a holy spell, A bliss by dayâa dream by night,â A thought on which his soul shall dwell,â A cheering and a guiding light. His be thy heart,âbut while no other Disturbs his image at its core, Still think of me as of a brother, I'd not be loved, nor love thee, more. For thee each feeling of my breast So holyâso serene shall be, That when thy heart to his is prest, 'Twill be no crime to think of me. I shall not wander forth at night, To breathe thy nameâas lovers would; Thy form, in visions of delight, Not oft shall break my solitude. But when my bosom-friends are near, And happy faces round me press, The goblet to my lips I'll rear, And drain it to thy happiness. And when, at morn or midnight hour, I commune with my God, alone, Before the throne of Peace and Power I'll blend thy welfare with my own. And if, with pure and fervent sighs, I bend before some loved one's shrine, When gazing on her gentle eyes, I shall not blush to think of thine. Thou, when thou meet'st thy love's caress, And when thy children climb thy knee, In thy calm hour of happiness, Then sometimesâsometimes think of me. In pain or healthâin grief or mirth, Oh, may it to my prayer be given That we may sometimes meet on earth, And meet, to part no more, in Heaven. THE HALL OF MY FATHERS. The subject of these lines is not a fictitious one. The âHallâ was the residence of a relation, now dead; and many of my happiest hours were spent under its roof. âI went to the place of my birth, and I saidâThe friends of my childhood, where are they?âand an echo answered, Where are they?â Arabic MS.âfrom Lord Byron. I. The spirit of my soul is changed, My thoughts have ta'en a sadder hue, Since last thy verdant lawns I ranged, And bade them, with a tear, adieu! And adverse fortune hath pursued With gloomiest hatred thine and thee, Forsaken mansion, since I stood With them, where they no more shall be. And they who smiled have learn'd to weep, And they who loved are rent asunder; Between them roars the angry deepâ Above them fate is black with thunder: And moss and weeds grow on thy wall; Deserted is my Father's Hall. II. Oh! my young heart danced to liveliest measures, And my ardent pulse beat high; And boyish joys, and hopes, and pleasures, Flash'd merrily in my eye: And smiling faces beam'd around me, And all was mirth and glee, And friendship's golden fetters bound me, When last I look'd on thee. But the dream of bliss is for ever fled, And the friends of my childhood are absent or dead. III. Yet oft, in solitary hours, Thine image floats across my brain, And all thy beauteous woods and bowers Rush on my soul again: And I roam on the banks of thy old canal, And I hear the roar of thy waterfall, And well-known forms to my eyes appear, And the voice of friends is in my ear; And I view, by the light of the trembling moon, The painted glass of thy old saloon, On which, in childhood's artless days, My wond'ring eyes were wont to gaze; While oft, with fond and pious care, My mother traced each semblance there, And bade me mark the red drops flow, In holy stains on my Saviour's brow, And the crown of thorns that encircled his head, And the cross that bore the Deathless Dead. Long shall these hours my thoughts control, So deep they sunk into my soul. IV. And oft I roved, with ardour young, Through gothic arch and gallery long; And view'd, emboss'd in panels high, The 'scutcheons of my ancestry; And portraits, ranged in order grave, Of statesmen proud and warriors brave; And dames who graced the festive sport Of good King Charles's gallant court. How reverend in my eyes appear'd Each hoary head and flowing beard! And how would fancy frame a tale For ev'ry antique coat of mail, And ev'ry scarf of lady bright, Guerdon most meet for gallant knight, Which painters' art had handed down From distant ages of renown! V. But proudest was my bosom's swell, And most my boyish soul was fired, When gaily would my grandame tell, How thither, with his court, retired From realms by civil discord rent, And fury of the Parliament, That Prince of heart misled, but good, Who stain'd the scaffold with his blood; And how, from that old gothic door, He heard the hostile cannon roar, And caught afar the foeman's tramp, And view'd the smoke of the rebel camp, And sigh'd at each cannon that threaten'd the town, And wept for his people, though not for his crown. How oft I gazed, with anxious care, On good King Charles's oaken chair; And proudly laid my humble head On good King Charles's royal bed; And joy'd to see the nook reveal'd, Where good King Charles had lain conceal'd And tasted calm and safe repose Surrounded by a thousand foes! VI. It soothes me now to think on days When grief and I were strangers yet, And feed, in thought, a frequent gaze On scenes the heart can ne'er forget. The friends who made those scenes so bright Are torn for ever from my sight; Their halls are falling to decay, Or own an unknown master's sway: But still upon my pensive soul, The feelings of my younger day, The hour of mirth, the party gay, In blissful visions roll. Oh! welcome, then, was December's blast, As it drove on the snow-storm thick and fast, And welcome the gloom of December's sky, For they told of approaching revelry; And gave the signal old and sweet, For dearest friends in one Hall to meet, Where jest, and song, and gallant cheer, Proclaim'd the Christmas of the year. VII. Oh! then was many a mirthful scene, And many a smiling face; And many a meeting glad was seen, And many a warm embrace; And oft around the blazing hearth Flew happy sounds of joy and mirth; And laughter loud and sprightly joke, Shook fretted roof and wall of oak: And gaily flow'd each prattling tongue, And all were merryâold and young; And souls were knit in union blest And every bosom was at rest. VIII. I may not view that Hall again, I may not hear those sounds of gladness, But their echoes linger in my brainâ A secret source of pleasing sadness. Friends of my young and sinless years, The long long ocean's waves divide us, But memory still your names endearsâ Still glows, whatever ills betide us. Oh! oft on India's burning shore, Ye will think on the home ye shall see no more, And wish your heated limbs were laid Beneath your own dear forest shade, Where murmurs, in its cool retreat, The well at which we used to meet, When the setting sun of autumn stood On the verge of the hill of Robin Hood, And shed the mellow tints of even O'er the dewy Earth and the silent Heaven. Oh! when shall eve return again, So sweet as those which bless'd us then? IX. But I must wake from this sweet dream, Whose spells, perchance, too long have found me; For manhood's prospects dimly gleam, And manhood's cares are gathering round me. I've made me new and cherish'd friends, I've bound congenial bosoms to me; But o'er the waves remembrance sends A prayer for those who ne'er shall view me. And oft I breathe a silent sigh For hours and pleasures long gone by: And each familiar face recall, That smiled within that ancient Hall. Fanuary, 1819. GODIVA, â A TALE. I Whoe'er has been at Coventry must know (Unless he's quite devoid of curiosity,) That once a year it has a sort of show, Conducted with much splendor and pomposity. I'll just describe it, if I canâbut no, It would exhaust the humour of a Fawcett, I Am a vile jesterâthough I once was vain Of acting Fawcett's parts at Datchet-lane. II Ah! those were pleasant days, when you and I, Dear Fred Golightly, trod those boards of yore; I often grieve to think that they're past by, As you mustâon a rainy after-four: Though, now it's fairly quash'd, you won't deny That that same stage was frequently a bore; It spoilt our cricket, which we're all so proud on, Nor let us beat the Kingsmenâas we've now done. III Oh! sweet is praise to youthful poet's ear, When gently warbled by the lips he loves: 'Tis sweet one's exercise read o'er to hear, (Especially the week before Removes); But sweeter far, when actors first appear, The loud collision of applauding gloves, The gleam of happy faces o'er them castâ Moments of triumph not to be surpass'd! IV Oh! stolen joys, far sweeter for the stealing, Oh! doubts, and fears, and hopes of Eton all, Ye are departed; but a lingering feeling Of your enchantments holds my heart in thrall. My eyes just now are fixed upon the ceilingâ I feel my cheek flushâhear my inkstand fall; My soul is wandering through the distant groves Of that dear schoolboy-dwelling which it loves. V But to my taleâI'm somewhat given to prating, I can't but own it, but my theme was fine, And all the feelings which I've been narrating Are worth enjoyingâand they've all been mine! But I'll no longer keep the reader waiting, So, without wasting now another line, My Poem I'll begin, as Poets use, With a short invocation to my Muse. VI Spirit which art within me, if in truth Thou dost exist in my soul's depths, and I Have not mistaken the hot pulse of youth, And wandering thoughts, for dreams of poesy, Rise from thy lone recesses, rise and soothe Each meaner thought to aspirations high, Whelm me in musings of deep joy, and roll Thy radiant visions on my kindling soul. VII If, when at morn I view the bright blue Heaven, Thoughts are around me which not all have felt; If, in the dim and fading light of Even, A Poet's rapture on my soul hath dwelt; If to my wayward nature have been given Dreams that absorb, and phantasies that melt, Sweet tears, and wild attachmentsâlend thy wings, Spirit, to bear me in my wanderings. VIII But these are boyish dreams.âAway, away, Ye fond enchantments of my foolish brain;â And yet, methinks, I would a while delay, Ere my frail vessel tempt Life's dangerous main. Still, dear delusions of my boyhood, stay, Still let me pour my weak, but harmless strain! In fancied draughts my thirst poetic slake, And never, never from that dream awake! IX This is a very pretty invocation, Though scarce adapted to my present style; I wrote it in a fit of inspiration, The finest I've enjoy'd a monstrous while; For most uncertain 's my imagination, And 'tis but seldom that my Muse will smile. Come, reader, we'll her present humour try; Draw up the curtainâthe scene's Coventry. X It is an ancient and a gallant town, Nor all unknown to loftier lays than mine; It has of old seen deeds of high renownâ Its situation 's not extremely fine. Its name it wishes to be handed down, And still in England's annals longs to shine; And Mr. Cobbett wants to represent This self-same Coventry in Parliament. XI But at the period when my tale commences There were no Cobbettsâ'twas a barb'rous age; The âSovereign Peopleâ scarce were in their senses, For Radical Reform was not the rage: Though then Sir Francis Wentworthânot Burdett. might have found pretences Just war against the Government to wage; For King and Nobles thought it no great crime To be confounded tyrants at that time. XII There was of yore an Earl of Coventry, Famous for wine and warâone Leofric; A genuine Saxonâhe'd a light blue eye, His stature tallâhis frame well-built and thick: His flaxen locks fell down luxuriantly On his fine shouldersâand his glance was quick. But though he really was a handsome Earl, He was at times a most uncommon churl. XIII He had fought well and oftenâmiles around Chieftain and vassal trembled at his name; He held some thousand acres of good ground, To which his weapon form'd his strongest claim: His legal title was sometimes unsoundâ And he was wedded to a matchless dame, The fair and chaste Godivaâwhom alone He seem'd to love, of all that was his own. XIV Well might he love her;âin that shape of lightness All woman's choicest beauties were combined; Her long dark locks set off her bosom's whiteness In its calm heavings, warm, and chaste, and kind. Her deep blue eyes shone with peculiar brightness, When through them flash'd the sunbeams of her mind; When swiftly sparkled joys, or hopes, or fears, Or sorrow bathed them in delicious tears. XV Hers was the face we look on once and love, Her voice was Music's echoâlike the strain Of our own land, heard, when afar we rove, With a deep sense of pleasure mix'd with pain: And those who once had heard it vainly strove To lose its echoes lingering in the brain: As for her figureâif you once had met it, Believe me, Sirs, you never could forget it. XVI She was the idol of her native land, The comforter and friend of its distress; Herself, unchasten'd by Affliction's hand, Felt for the woes of others not the less. The serfs, who trembled at her Lord's command, Forbore to curse him for her loveliness. They were a pair one often meets in life,â A churlish husband with a charming wife. XVII It chanced, A.D. Eight Hundred and Eighteen, (I love to be correct in my chronology, And all the tables which by chance I've seen Concur in this date. When I was in College I Conducted once the famous Magazine, Th' Etonian's predecessor. This apology Will serve, I hope, among all folks discerning, For my correctnessâboth in taste and learning.) XVIII It chanced, A.D. Eight Hundred and Eighteen, 'Twas a bad season: rain, and blight, and frost Destroy'd the harvest, while the crops were green,â Wheatâbarleyâoatsâand turnips, all were crost. The ruin'd peasants grew extremely lean, There's no computing what that year they lost: They look'd just like so many half-starved weasels, The sheep all diedâthe pigs had got the measles. XIX Leofric's table suffer'd: he was ever (As Earls are sometimes) an enormous glutton; Venison he loved, but, though a dainty liver, He was a perfect Colleger at mutton. He now discover'd that his table never A decent leg or shoulder could be put on; Dry was each wither'd joint, where fat was not, And sometimes tasted strongly of the rot. XX There was a sad deficiency in greens; Parsnips and carrots nowhere could be found, Very possiblyâin the ninth century. The very horses scorn'd to eat the beans, The turnips were frost-bitten and unsound. In fact the hungry peasants had no means To pay their rents:âthe Earl look'd grim and frown'd; And wisely judged it would be saving trouble, Like Harrow cricketers, to tax them double. âIf any member refuse to pay a fine imposed by the Club, the fine shall be doubled.ââRules of the Harrow Cricket Club, 1818. XXI Whether this plan was likely to succeed, Is more than I can possibly divine; Physicians seldom think it right to bleed A patient dying of a deep decline. The poor petition'd in this utmost need; Alas! they found it was in vain to whine; The hungry Earl refused to hear a word; (We know petitions are sometimes absurd.) XXII âHe grieved,â he said, âbut 't wasn't his look-out, If all his serfs and vassals starved together; The year had been a rainy one, no doubt, But what of that?âhe didn't make the weather. They should have minded what they were about, And not have sent such muttonâ'twas like leather. In short, unless they paid in their arrears, He'd beat their houses down about their ears.â XXIII Then fell despair upon them:âhome they went With wild and gloomy aspects, and sat down Each by his desolate hearth; some, weeping, leant Their heads on their clasp'd hands; throughout the town Went female shrieks and wailings; all content, Domestic joy, and peace, and hope were flown; And each look'd round upon his family, And said that nought was left themâbut to die. XXIV One had been lately wedded,âhis young bride Gazed, as he enter'd, on his frenzied eye, And read her fate, yet she essay'd to hide Her own forebodings of deep misery; And strove to smile, and, seated by his side, Used all her loved caresses cheeringly; And said those sorrows soon would be forgot, And fondly whisper'd hopeâwhere hope was not. XXV And then she spoke of their long mutual love, Their youthful vows, and lately plighted troth,â And then she said that there was One above Who had protectedâwould protect them both. Remorse might yet the Earl's stern nature move,â âHerself,â she added, âto despair was loath.â But when she found her arts were vain, she crept Into his bosomâhid her faceâand wept. XXVI It was a night of horror and despair! Mothers were shrieking in distraction wild, And Fathers, with a fix'd unconscious glare, Gazed on the wan cheeks of each starving child! A few were kneeling, wrapt in fervent pray'r, And these alone, in their devotion, smiled; While he, the author of an earldom's woeâ Slept upon fair Godiva's breast of snow. XXVII Alas! Godiva, that a heart like thine Should by so stern a tyrant's head be press'd!â Short were his dreams, he woke at half-past nine, Feeling a strange oppression at his chest; And yet that day he'd drank five quarts of wine, A great achievement, no doubt, but not equal to that of the celebrated Moore, of Moore-hall, who, immediately before his combat With the Dragon of Wantley, is said to have swallowed, ââTo make him strong and mighty, Six quarts of ale, and one of aquavitÃ¦.â Which one would fancy would have made him rest. Whether 'twas conscience or an indigestion Produced this nightmare, still remains a question. XXVIII Godiva was awakeâshe had not slept For sad reflections on her country's woes, And bitter floods of anguish had she wept, Her grief was far too burning for repose. As down her cheeks the tears in silence crept, At last they trickled to her husband's nose, Who in plain terms (he seldom used to flatter) Demanded âWhat the Devil was the matter.â XXIX Her tears fell faster, but she answer'd not; In vain at first she strove her voice to find; The courteous Saxon thought his wife had got The tooth-ache, and grew wonderfully kind. But when Godiva gently told him what So much afflicted not her teethâbut mind, He scratch'd his head, and stared like one confoundedâ Never was man so perfectly astounded. XXX He could not form, for his part, the least notion Of what appear'd so singular a whim, He'd always fancied that his wife's devotion, Thoughts, passions, wishes, centred all in him. Much was he puzzled by this strange emotion,â How was it possible a dame so slim, So elegant and tasty as his wife, Could feel for wretches quite in humble life? XXXI It was a problem which he could not solve, 'Twas just what mathematics are to me, A science which the longer I revolve, The surer am I we shall ne'er agree: And so I very prudently resolve To give it up, and stick to poetry, Which is, in fact, extremely pretty sport, And I'm inclined to fancy quite my forte. XXXII My Simpson's Euclid, you're a cursed bore, Although, no doubt, a treasure in your way, And those who doat on science may explore Your problemsâwith what appetite they may. I have no head for mathematic lore, Therefore, my Simpson's Euclid, I must say (Though I'm desirous not to be uncivil) I most devoutly wish you at the Devil. XXXIII But oh! the thousand joys of versifying! One writes, and blots, and reads 'em o'er and o'er, And, every time one reads 'em, can't help spying A thousand beauties unobserved before; And then one fancies all the ladies cryingâ Reviewers make some rhymesters rather sore; I for my own part am a careless dog, And love to hear mine criticisedâincog. XXIV But poor Godivaâin her tears she lay, 'Twas a sad pity that t'was in the night, Because, had it but happen'd in the day, Her weeping beauty had prevail'd outright: E'en then she charm'd her husband's rage away, And nearly gain'd her purposeâthough not quite; For, after all her eloquent persuasion, He tried to cheat her by a mean evasion. XXXV âMy dear,â said he, âyou've argued wondrous well, I'm quite delighted with your long oration, On all its beauties I forbear to dwell, Enough that it hath met my approbation; So much so, that to-morrow you may tell Fair Coventry, it's free from all taxation, If but these terms your approbation meetâ That you ride naked through the public street.â XXXVI Godiva startedâwell indeed she might, She almost doubted her own ears' veracity; My modest pen can scarce endure to write A speech of such unparallel'd audacity. Leofric thought he had perplex'd her quite, And grinn'd immensely at his own sagacity; For which I hold him a consummate beast, Deserving of the pillory at least. XXXVII Shame on the heartless churl!âcould he repose On that so lovely bosom, which, he knew, For him, albeit the author of its woes, Throbb'd with affection, warm, and chaste, and true? And could he thus its holy charms expose Unveil'd and blushing to the public view? Ay, bid slaves gaze on beauties, which alone (Though Kings had sigh'd for) he might call his own! XXXVIII And yet I can't but own that modern spouses In his opinion seem to acquiesce; I've seen, in many fashionable houses, The ladies waltzing in complete undress; A custom which no sort of feeling rouses Amongst their husbandsâand I must confess, (Being unmarried) that I see no faults in Ladies, young, lovely, and half-naked, waltzing. XXXIX I must say I enjoy itâ't is a pleasure Good-natured fair ones grant to amorous swains; I like to whirl to that bewildering measure, Which, âjust like loveââor brandy, turns one's brains; I like to view my partner's charms at leisure, Till scarce a secret for the bride remains; While round her waist each wanton finger strays, And counts the whalebones in her panting stays. XL Let jealous husbands (if such still there be In this improving age) cry out âFor shame!â Let Quakers say our manners are too free, And gouty folks quadrilles and waltzes blame; I here protest I never will agree In such reproachesâtill I'm blind and lame. Let maids of fifty prate of immorality, I'm for the sexes' rational equality. My eulogies on Waltzing are ironical. XLI These are new doctrines: in Godiva's age Husbands alone were privileged to kiss; I said before, Reform was not the rage, So that such nonsense was not then amiss; And, though I've ransack'd many an ancient page, I find but one case similar to this,â That of Candaulesâhanded down to us By Barry Cornwall, and Herodotus. XLII Oh! matrimonial love, which I so long Have fondly painted to my fancy's eye, In vain would I embody now in song My young conceptions of thy purity. Thou should'st be chaste, tho' ardent; mild, tho' strong; Thou should'st beâhang it, it's in vain to try,â Thou should'st beâall that in my heart's recess I long have worshipp'd, but can ne'er express. XLIII And thou, fair image, whatsoe'er thou art, The loved creation of my boyish brain, The destined partner of my cares and heart, To share my pleasures, and to soothe my pain; Still of my dearest visions be a part, In many a midnight dream appear again; Still let me clasp thee to my glowing breast, Enjoy thy converse, and in sleep be blest. XLIV And if not all a phantom of my thought, And thou indeed hast being, may thy young And sinless years be happy, and may nought That tastes of sorrow in thy path be flung: May purest lessons thy young heart be taught, And each expanding thought to virtue strung; May'st thou have some accomplishmentsâmuch grace, And lovely as thy spirit beâthy face. XLV I shall be quite enraptured if you sing, So but your taste is pure as was the Attics'; I only beg you'll take care not to fling Your time away in learning mathematics; Nor to my arms a heavy portion bring Of chemistryâand Greekâand hydrostatics; You may nurse pinks and tulips, if you've got any, But be no florist, love,ânor deal in botany. XLVI I mention this, because I know some ladies Whose conversation is almost a bore; But I should laud them, as the Poet's trade is, So won't pursue this topic any more. Return we to our tale, which, I'm afraid is Too long in tellingâbut it's nearly o'er: Godiva turn'd at last, with looks imploring, And found her husband (like my reader) snoring. XLVII Too well she knew to wake him would be vain; She thought 'twas best to let him slumber on, Or else his humour might relapse again, And all she had effected be undone. She lay, and communed with her heart and brain,â Her thoughts I know not, but when morning shone, She told her husband, with a steadfast eye, She had revolved the matterâand would try. XLVIII Her speech on this occasion I'd recorded In my foul copy, and we all agreed That it was most astonishingly worded, For one who never learnt to write or read; Yet scope for mirth it might have well afforded To modern misses of our British breed; And grave blue-stockings would, no dould, have said âGodiva's heart was better than her head.â XLIX Had she at some snug boarding-school been placed Of modern growth for female education, She would have had a most uncommon taste, And I might now have printed her oration. Her native genius she would then have graced With stores of every sort of information, And had, at twelve years old, more general knowledge Than boys of fifteen gain at Eton College. L She turn'd and left his Lordship sore perplex'd, He almost question'd if he was awake, And knew not whether to feel pleased or vex'd; Still less, what step it would be right to take. He âwonder'd what the Devil she'd do next Who could so bold a resolution make:â And felt a sort of shame that he'd consented, And, for the first time in his life, repented. LI But then he felt he never could retract, (At least he would notâwhich was much the same) And if his wife thought proper thus to act, He couldn't help itâhe was not to blame! So that day, after breakfast, off he pack'd A trumpeter (I quite forget his name) To tell the people, in the market-place, His wife's intentionâand his own disgrace. LII It was an idle morn in Coventry, The people wander'd through the gloomy mart; Labour with hope was o'er, and listlessly Their footsteps traversed each unheeded part; Despair was yielding fast to apathyâ They were prepared to die,âand every heart Its weight of woe had half forgot to feel,â When in their ears shrill rung a trumpet-peal. LIII There was a sudden crowding round the space Whence the sound cameâand then from man to man, Throughout the full and spacious market-place, A sudden, cold, electric shudder ran; And each glanced quickly on his neighbour's face, As if the working of his thought to scan,â And then in every countenance were blent Joy, love, and anger, and astonishment. LIV A breathless pause succeeded,âthen arose A low and gathering murmur in the crowd, Like the far peal that breaks the dread repose Cast by the shadow of a thunder-cloud: And fast and far that thrilling murmur flows On through the multitudeâyet grows not loudâ Slowly it died,âand nought but trampling feet Of crowds dispersing sounded in the street. LV Noon came, yet ne'er in Coventry had reign'd At deepest midnight silence so profound; In the wide streets no human form remain'd, It seem'd as Death had swallow'd all around: It was like that enchanted city, feign'd In Oriental Tales, where all were bound In magic slumbers, and transform'd to stoneâ A story pretty generally known. LVI What were Godiva's thoughts at that dread hour In her lone chamber? Silent did she kneel, Her deep blue eyes raised meekly to the Power Of Heaven, in dumb, yet eloquent appeal. Thus pray'd the gentle lady in her bower, Till o'er her sorrows peace began to steal, And the calm rapture of the silent skies Had sunk into her spirit through her eyes. LVII The lady rose from prayer, with cheek o'erflush'd, And eyes all radiant with celestial fire, The anguish'd beatings of her heart were hush'd, So calmly heavenward did her thoughts aspire. A moment's pauseâand then she deeply blush'd, As, trembling, she unclasp'd her rich attire, And shrinking from the sunlight, shone confest The ripe and dazzling beauties of her breast. LVIII And when her white and radiant limbs lay bare, The fillet from her brow the dame unbound, And let the traces of her raven hair Flow down in wavy lightness to the ground, Till half they veil'd her limbs and bosom fair, In dark and shadowy beauty floating round, As clouds, in the still firmament of June, Shade the pale splendors of the midnight Moon. LIX But then her spirit fell when thus alone She stood in the deep silence of her bower, And felt that there she was beheld by none Save One unknown, supreme, eternal Power. She dared not raise her meek eyes, trembling one, Again from earth; she could have wish'd that hour Rather in view of thousands to have stood, Than in that still and awful solitude. LX Awayâaway, with wild and hurried pace, Through many a long and echoing room she stole; No voice arrests her ear, no human face Bursts on the dreamy wildness of her soul. All silent now is that proud dwelling-place,â Onâon she presses till she reach the goal; The portal's pass'dâshe sees her palfrey stand, Held by a weak and weeping maiden's hand. LXI Away, away!âthe Lady hath departed; The freedom of the land will soon be won: Rejoice, ye wrong'd, and spurn'd, and broken-hearted, Rejoice!âfor your deliverance is begun. It's full five minutes since Godiva started, She'll be among you before half-past one; Therefore, take care, both bachelors and spouses, All but the blind, to keep within your houses. LXII Godiva pass'd, but all had disappear'd, Each in his dwelling's innermost recess: One would have thought all mortal eyes had fear'd To gaze upon her dazzling loveliness. Sudden her palfrey stopp'd, and neigh'd, and rear'd, And prick'd his earsâas if he would express That there was something wicked in the wind; Godiva trembled and held fast behind. LXIII And here I also must remark that this is With ladies very frequently the case, And beg to hint to all Equestrian Misses, That horses' backs are not their proper place. A woman's forte is musicâloveâor kisses, Not leaping gates, or galloping a race; I used sometimes to ride with them of yore, And always found them an infernal bore. LXIV The steed grew quiet, and a piercing cry Burst on Godiva's ear;âshe started, and Beheld a man, who, in a window high, Shaded his dim eyes with his trembling hand. He had been led by curiosity To see her pass, and there had ta'en his stand; And as he gazed ('tis thus the story's read), His eyeballs sunk and shrivell'd in his head. LXV I know not, gentles, whether this be true; If so, you'll own the punishment was just; Poor wretch!âfull dearly had he cause to rue His prying temper, or unbridled lust. No more could he his daily toil pursueâ He was a tinkerâbut his tools might rust, He might dispose of all his stock of metal, For ne'er, thenceforward, could he mend a kettle. LXVI Alas! poor Peeping Tom! Godiva kept And fed him.âReader, now my tale is told; I need not state how all the peasants wept, And laugh'd, and bless'd their Countessâyoung and old. That night Godiva very soundly sleptâ I grieve to add she caught a trifling cold; Leofric's heart was so extremely full, He roasted for the populace a bull. LXVII There stood an ancient cross at Coventry, Pull'd down, of late, by order of the Mayor, Because 'twas clear its downfall must be nigh, And 'twould be too expensive to repair; It bore two figures carvedâand you might spy Beneath them graved, in letters large and fair, Godiva, Leofric, for love of thee, Doth make henceforth fair Coventry toll free. LXVIII The tale's believed by all the population, And still a sham Godiva, every year, Is carried by the Mayor and Corporation In grand processionâand the mob get beer. Gentles, I've spent my fit of inspiration, Which being over, I must leave you here; And for Godivaâhope you'll decent think her, Laugh at her husband, and forgive the tinker. 1820. MAIMOUNE,âA POEM. CANTO I. I In those fantastic days, when elves and fairies Held high command o'er sublunary things, And teased us mortals with as mad vagaries As ever sprung from bard's imaginings, Playing strange pranks in cellars and in dairies, Riding the Nightmare o'er the breasts of kings; Souring good beer, cow-milking, and cream-skimming, And thumping clowns by night, and pinching women: II When madcap Oberon reign'd in all his glory, Now holding Kinglike quarrels with his Queen; And now with Puck upon the promontory, Seeing such sights as since were never seen; There lived, renown'd in Oriental story, A mighty Kingâwe'll call him Fadladeen, Because his name's not mention'd by the Lady Whose tale I borrow, Queen ScheherazadÃ©. III Fame says he reign'd with wondrous approbation, (Especially of courtiers and bashaws;) In times of peace was mild in his taxation, And made some very creditable laws; Indeed, in their invidious situation, Few Monarchs ever gain'd so much applause; In private life, a truth I can't evade is, He was a perfect devil with the Ladies. IV He had a most inveterate aversion To matrimonial fetters; and he swore, In oaths befitting so sublime a person, That 't was unworthy of the crown he wore, And inconsistent with the State's exertion, To wed a number that exceeded four; And so, to give his royal conscience ease, He had four Wives, and sixty Mistresses. V It seems that this arrangement was ill-made, for He had no issue, save an only son, Whom twelve long years he had devoutly pray'd for, To all his country's Gods;âwhen all was done This single boy would have been cheaply paid for By the oblation of his Father's throne; For in all lands, from Araby to Aragon, The Sun ne'er saw so wonderful a paragon. VI I don't intend to give a long narration Of his surpassing beauty, for I hate Your cursed, detail'd, minute enumeration Of cheeks, eyes, noses, lips, hair, shape, and gait. It is enough that he became his station, He look'd, and walk'd, and spoke, and drank, and ate, As for a Hero of Romance 't is meet To look, and walk, and speak, and drink, and eat. VII You may suppose the youngster was a pet, E'en from his cradle, a spoil'd child indeed; The self-will'd tyrant of the Haram; yet It seem'd no spoiling could with him succeed. 'Twas very rarely he was known to fret, And very quickly did he learn to read; At four years old, I've heard, he wrote some verses To a lame, humpback'd daughter of his Nurse's. VIII And years pass'd swiftly o'er him, and he grew In stature and in strength; his Tutors swore (And I believe that it was strictly true) His Royal Highness knew a vast deal more Than the most erudite of all their crew; In fact, they found it an exceeding bore, Whether for pleasure or for pride he task'd them, To answer half the questions that he ask'd them. IX He was a great proficient in Astrology; The best Accomptant in his sire's dominions; Had dipp'd in Mathematics; in Theology 'Twas thought he held heretical opinions; But this was doubtful:âin all sorts of knowledge he Was an adept, but on the Muse's pinions 'Twas his delight to soar; when mounted on 'em, he Cared little for political economy. X An earnest lover of the Muse was he, And did her bidding for her own sweet sake; Nor Fame he sigh'd for, nor aspired to be A star among the great; but in the lake Which flows around the dome of Poesy He long'd the fever of his thirst to slake; And drink the Music in his soul, which springs From her deep, holy, lone imaginings. XI No proud intents, no purposes sublime Had he, nor care for glory not to die; No aspirations over Fate and Time, Nor longings after Immortality. He was no builder of the lofty rhyme, His own glad thoughts were all his Poesy; He call'd his Album, in quaint terms of praise, His âregister of comfortable days.â XII And thus, from all his bosom's best affections, And sweet emotions, not unmix'd with pain, From childhood's hopes, and boyhood's recollections, And many a roving thought that cross'd his brain, Season'd with here and there some grave reflections, He framed a sort of desultory strain. Of course at Court his rhyming gain'd much credit From all who had, and some who hadn't read it. XIII And thus his boyhood slid in smiles away, And he was nigh upon his sixteenth year, When, as it fell upon a certain day, He had a summons straightway to appear Before his Father; as he went, they say, His young limbs shook with an unusual fear; He had a strange presentiment, no doubt, That some infernal mischief was about. XIV His gracious Father had it seems discern'd (He was a Prince of infinite sagacity;) Or it may be, by long experience learn'd, (Which much confirm'd him in his pertinacity,) That youthful blood with headstrong passion burn'd, And play'd the deuce with Princes; so, to dash it, he Forgot his own antipathies, and swore His son should marry, and run wild no more. XV He had moreover, as his subjects thought, Some more conclusive reasons of his own; The King of China would have dearly bought Just then a close alliance with his Throne; And had a most enchanting daughter, sought By the East's proudest, yet the Maiden shone Unmated still, and fancy-free, enshrined In the pure brightness of her vestal mind. XVI She had seen fifteen summers; Youth had wrapp'd her In its most radiant loveliness; no glance Of her wild eyes ere shone without a capture, E'en through her veil; and oh! to see her dance! Why 'twould have kill'd our British beaux with rapture, And caused a âgreat sensationâ e'en in France. Her voice of Music wander'd through men's ears, And, when most mirthful, fill'd their eyes with tears. XVII Badoura! fair Badoura! would thy charms Might float before my bliss-bewilder'd vision! Would I might once enfold thee in my arms, And fancy thou wert mine in dreams Elysian! I think I then could laugh at Care's alarms, And hold the bluest devils in derision; For ever could we live (my Muse and I) On the remembrance of that ecstacy. XVIII I own it has not been my boyhood's lot To fall in love so often as is common; My early flames were speedily forgot, Replaced but slowly; though the name of woman Has always occupied a decent spot In my affections, and I'm sure that no man Can write more highly than I wrote of late Of the enjoyments of the married state. Godiva, stanza xlii. XIX But, though I grieve extremely to declare it, I Feel bound to tell what I esteem the truth; That female beauty is, in fact, a rarity E'en in the gay, unwrinkled cheeks of youth. In number, as in charms, there's a disparity Between the plain and pretty, and in sooth I meet, at present, with few female eyes Whose smiles remind me much of Paradise. XX Yet have I dwelt, for many a pleasant week, in A land whose women are the boast of fame; Hail to the peerless belles around the Wrekin! Hail to each wedded and unwedded dame! Though really (unpoetically speaking) With three exceptions, whom I dare not name, I wouldn't give the value of a gooseberry For all the beauty that I've found in S? XXI Oh! gentle Lady, with the dark-brown hair Braided above thy melancholy eyes, And pale thin cheek so delicately fair, And voice so full of woman's sympathies; Woe for thy beauty! the fell demon, Care, Too soon hath made thy tender heart his prize; Too soon those smiles, which ever and anon Threw sunshine o'er thy loveliness, are gone. XXII Lonely art thou amid the fluttering crowd That throngs the gay and gilded drawing-room; For aye enwrapp'd and darken'd in a cloud Of cheerless and impenetrable gloom. The heartless glances of the gay and proud, Which dwelt so rudely on thy beauty's bloom, Pass thy pale cheek unheeding, and despise The dimness of thy sorrow-speaking eyes. XXIII Yet when perchance a happier maid hath woken The sweetness of some old-remember'd air, Whose touching music to thy heart hath spoken Of the old days that were so passing fair: I've seen the spell that hangs around thee broken By rising visions of the things that were; And thy faint blush and gushing tears have told That crush'd affections have not yet grown cold. XXIV But oh! to me most lovely and most loved, In thy calm hour of dreaming solitude; When I have track'd thy footsteps as they roved Through the thick mazes of the tangled wood; Or to sweet sadness by the story moved, By thy fair side, in mute attention, stood, Still in thine eyes my lovesick bosom sunningâ But where the devil is my fancy running? XV The fair Badoura had conceived a whim in Her lovely head, of wisdom most profound; Her brain in wild fantastic dreams was swimming, Such as with maidens now and then abound, But rarely vex the pates of married womenâ She fancied she might search the world around, And find no husband in its dreary waste, To suit her very reasonable taste. XXVI And she had sworn by every good Divinity That ever on Olympus had a throne, That, should her days be lengthen'd to infinity, No husband ever should unloose her zone, Nor steal the jewel of her bright virginity; That treasure should, at least, remain her own. 'Twas a strange whim, but what the stranger fact is, She seem'd resolved to put the whim in practice. XXVII She knelt before her sire, that gentle maid, Like young Diana at the feet of Jove, (As mentioned by Callimachus) and pray'd By all her peace on earth, and hopes above, That if she ever had his will obey'd, If he did ever his dear daughter love, He would permit her still to live and die In calm, unsullied, sinless chastity. XXIII And much she argued on the wiles of men, Their base deceit, their gross dissimulation, Their falsehood and their cruelty; and then She praised the virtues of a single station: And âif she should be married, when, oh! when Could she enjoy such mirth and recreation, Such joyous freedom, such unbounded sport, As she was used to at her father's court?â XXIX Ah! poor Badoura! in a luckless hour Thou com'st to urge thine innocent intreaty; No, though thy bright and eloquent eyes should shower A sea of tears upon thy father's feet, he Will never yield to their persuasive pow'r!â He had, in fact, just ratified a treaty By which his daughter was declared the Queen Of the young hopeful heir of Fadladeen. XXX For six whole months the mischief had been brewing With such sagacious secrecy, that few Suspected half the plans that were pursuing, And not a soul in all the kingdom knew That his respected Monarch had been doing What none but Monarchs have the face to do; And sign'd the contract which he felt would sever His child from hope and happiness for ever. XXXI Alas! poor Royalty! how far removed Art thou from all the blessedness of earth! Is't not enough that thou hast never proved The bliss of friendship, nor enjoy'd the mirth Of happy spirits, loving and beloved? Is't not enough that thou must feel the dearth Of cheering looks, and languidly repress The hollow smiles of palace heartlessness? XXXII Is't not enough that tranquil sleep is driven From thy uneasy pillow?âthat thy brain Must throb for ever, and thy heart be riven With weariness and care, and scarce retain A dream obscure, a wandering ray of heav'n, So closely fetter'd by the earth's dull chain? It's not enough that Fancy's self hath left Thy broken slumber of her joys bereft? XXXII Oh! is not this enough? but must thou link Thy care-worn heart to an unloving mate; And for the bliss of chaste affection, drink The bitter cup of carelessness or hate, Unsolaced and unpitied?âCanst thou think There is on earth a thing so desolate As thou, who yieldest for thy tinsel prize Love's self, our last faint ray from Paradise? XXXIV So felt perchance Badoura, as she knelt Before her father with her strange petition: Oh! in her voice what sweet persuasion dwelt! How moving was her look of meek submission! I don't know how her gracious father felt, But he was far too great a politician To let absurd, intrusive feelings glance Through his profound and passionless countenance. XV He simply answer'd, that âhe quite agreed In every single syllable she'd said; Such notions were most amiable indeed, And did much credit to her heart and head. He only grieved that there was urgent need That she should set off instantly to wed The heir apparent of a distant Stateâ Her resolution had been form'd too late.â XXXVI This was not what Badoura had expected, And a distracting scene of course ensued; The Maid declared the match must be rejected, The King swore roundly, âd?n him if it should: She ought to jump to be so well connected;ââ She still persisted that she never would: He swore that she must do as she was bid, And should be lock'd up closely till she did. XXXVII Poor girl, they shut her in a lonely tower, (O! subject meet for melancholy verse;) Nor would the old hard-hearted brute allow her One poor companion, save her kind old Nurse. 'Twas a sad stretch of arbitrary power, For the convenience of his privy purse: (I own to me it seems extremely funny How money matters mix with matrimony.) XXXVIII In the mean time, while all the Chinese court Was in confusion with this pleasant scene, Another, quite as pleasant of the sort, Was acting by the Prince and Fadladeen. But 'twould be indecorous to report Such angry squabbles as should ne'er have been. The Youth, in short, was of the Lady's mind, And like the Lady was the Youth confined. XXXIX Judge not, fair dames, too harshly of his heart, Nor deem it quite to your attractions blind, Insensible and dead to Cupid's dart, And careless of the eyes of womankind, Perhaps some luckier beauties had the start Of poor Badoura in his wayward mind; Perhaps some young Court-Siren's fascination Within his breast had caused a palpitation. XL Perhapsâbut noâthe truth must be confess'd; No woman had dominion o'er his soul; His eyes had wander'd o'er earth's loveliest, And still his heart was free from their control: Yet did he madly love, and o'er his rest Dreams of such bright and passionate beauty stole, As oft in slumber to the Poet's eyes Disclose the long-lost joys of Paradise. XLI He was, I said, a Poet from his birth, And fairyland around his boyhood shone; His soul drank in the beauty of the earth With fervent joy, but near his Father's throne How did he feel of kindred souls the dearth! How sigh for some beloved and loving one, To whom he might in solitude reveal Bliss which the hearts around him could not feel! XLII So he grew pensive, and at times would wander Through lonely dell, and unfrequented wood; And on his fate in deep abstraction ponder, And in his more imaginative mood Would picture to himself a dream of wonder, A lot he would have chosen if he could; And shadow out a creature who would be The gentle sharer of his sympathy. XLIII And then he search'd the tomes of old romance, (I don't know how he got romances) there He cull'd from many a heroine's countenance The traits he thought most exquisitely fair; From one he stole her eyes' o'erwhelming glance, And from another clipp'd her auburn hair: From this her lips, from that her blushes stole, And from five hundred form'd one lovely whole. XLIV And then for taste and feeling, sense and wit, With which this dainty creature must abound; Again he search'd all Tales that e'er were writ, And chose the brightest models that he found; Which blending with his dreamings, in a fit Of joy he swore that all the world around No living beauty could be found so bright As that which swam in his Quixottic sight. XLV 'Twas ever with him, this imagined form; And as the wayward fancy stronger grew, The bright creation shone in hues so warm, So palpably apparent to his view, That he grew quite enraptured, and a storm Of such wild passion on his bosom blew, That in his fits he deem'd the vision real, And fell in love with this bright shape ideal. XLVI It was a silly fancyânever mind; It made him happy, if it made him mad: The worst on't was he couldn't feel resign'd To execute the orders of his Dad. But when he was, in consequence, confined, Wrapp'd in this vision, he was seldom sad. The King imagined that the boy was frantic, Though the fact was he only was romantic. XLVII The good old Monarch loved his headstrong son, (Though 't was a cruel measure, I must say, A thing which no wise Father would have done, To lock him up in that outrageous way;) And, fearing sorely that his wits were gone, He bled and dosed him every other day. 'Twas all in vain,âno physic could remove His wild, ideal, solitary love. XLVIII Affairs bore now a most forlorn appearance, Both Monarchs were confoundedly afraid, That, spite of their parental interference, The marriage would be grievously delay'd. Though both had hopes, they said, âthat in a year hence They might perhaps contrive to be obey'd.â So in this state we'll leave them for the present, And turn to prospects rather less unpleasant. XLIX I don't know how, for many a weary line I've prosed of courtship, wedlock, love, and fighting, Till I've arrived at Stanza forty-nine, And grown half-weary of the stuff I'm writing; And yet (confound this stupied head of mine) Ne'er thought, one single moment, of inditing A strain of soft and eulogistic flummery, On your approaching nuptials, Miss Montgomery. L A little whileâa few short weeksâand thou Shalt go forth gaily in thy bridal dress; Serene, yet bearing on thy modest brow The timid blush of virgin bashfulness. And thou shalt pledge the irrevocable vow, And utter (if thou canst) the fatal âYesâ At which most ladies' lips are apt to falter, When they come fairly to the marriage altar. LI Thou hast done wiselyâthy young eloquent eyes Long might with gentle victories have shone; Well dost thou choose, for many a fleeting prize, The better triumph of securing one. Well dost thou choose, for many a lover's sighs, A husband's smile; and since we can't but own That you were form'd for doing execution, The more praiseworthy is your resolution. LII But we shall miss, beside our quiet hearth, The delicate form, the sunshine of thine eye, The frankness of thy laughter-loving mirth, Thy voice so rich in sweetest melody; And when I seek this dearest spot of Earth, From my world-weary rovings, I shall sigh To meet no longer in my Father's hall The fairest face, the lightest step of all. LIII I'll write a fine description in the papers Of the proceedings of your wedding-day; And give old maids and bachelors the vapours, Telling how bright your looks, your dress how gay; And then Ill praise your milliners and drapers, Beginning somewhat in the following way: âMarried last week, at ? in this Shire, Miss H. Montgomery to T. S?, Esquire.â LIV Fie on my giggling Muse, who can't be serious For half a stanza on so grave a theme; But 'tis in vain for me to be imperious, When she's determined to rebel; I deem, Most courteous readers, that this strain will weary us, And I shall sadly sink in your esteem If I pursue it longer; if you please I'll breathe awhile, and give your Worships ease. LV Yet, ere I close my Canto, I must mention What should have been declared some stanzas backâ That 'twas not my original intention To follow so irregular a track; And I must own I merit reprehension And punishment for having been so slack To introduce you to the sportive Dame, From whom this wondrous story takes its name. LVI I must implore your pardon, and will try (If you get through this Canto) in my next To check the rovings of my Phantasy, And stick a little closer to my text. âI've wandered from my theme, yet scarce know why,â As sings a friend of mine,âfor I'm perplex'd For time; could I but polish as I would, I'd make my Poem wonderfully good. CANTO II. I My ink is mix'd with tears of deep vexation To know what Mr. Courtenay has decreed; That here no more our King shall fill his station, That Club and Punchbowl all to fate must cede! What! can't we have another Coronation In the Fusticular Kingdom? I, indeed, Have half a mindâif it were not so lateâ For this same Crown to be a candidate. II Ah! Gerard! Gerard! what wouldst thou be doing? (Quoth my astonish'd Muse) is this thine high Commiseration of the cares pursuing The unbless'd course of wretched Royalty? Why didst thou prate, last Canto, of the ruin Of Royal spirits?âwas it all a lie? And did you talk in that high-sounding way Only because you'd nothing else to say? III Gerard, I'm quite ashamed of youâtake careâ I'll not be treated (trust me) in this sort; How can you hope to breathe poetic air In the unhealthy climate of a court? Do you suppose you'll ever find me there? Pray have the voters promised you support? Poetic air, said I?âyour chance is small, Just now, of breathing any air at all. IV Haven't you had an asthma all the spring? Ar'n't you, this moment, wheezing like a kettle? And yet, forsooth, you want to be a King; And, though you scarce can fetch your breath, to settle Affairs of State?â'twould be a pretty thingâ I thought you'd been a man of different metal. Reign if you willâbut when by me forsaken, You'll find that you're confoundedly mistaken. V Sweet Muse, have patienceâtrust me, I ne'er meant In earnest to petition for the throne; Though thou dost smile but seldom, I'm content With thy uncertain humours; but I own 'Tis a sad bore to have thy fancies pent Within my brainâall joys of printing flownâ No praise my dear anonymous state to sweeten, And all because some folks are leaving Eton. VI But come once more, and kindly condescend To lend thine inspiration, dearest Muse; Look not so grave,âI ask you as a friend, For, if you don't assist me, I shall lose My way in long digressions without end, And not a single reader will peruse My tedious rhymesâI scarce could get a man to Wade through my last interminable Canto. VII I said, just now, I'd introduce my reader To the fair Sprite who gives my Tale a name; And since, in a few stanzas, I shall need her For special purposes, 'twould be a shame, Should I delay into your view to lead her; So forth she steps, this visionary dame, MaimounÃ©, a mad Fairy, gay and bright As any elf that e'er play'd pranks by night. VIII She came on Earth soon after the creation, And was akin to Oberon, 'tis said; In Faeryland received her education, But never yet had been induced to wed, Though she was woo'd by half the Elfin nationâ But still a free and roving life she led; And sought diversion for her gentle mind Chiefly among the haunts of humankind. IX There was a deep and solitary well in The palace where the Prince was now confined, Which served this lovely Fairy for a dwelling, A spot just suited to a Fairy's mind; Much like the fountain where Narcissus fell in Love with her own fair face, and pined, and pined To death (the passion 's not at all uncommon In Man, and very prevalent in Woman). X Beneath this fountain's fresh and bubbling water, Unfathomably deep, the livelong day, This wondrous Fairy, Time's most radiant daughter, In unimaginable visions lay; Where never earthly care or sorrow sought her, But o'er her head did the wild waters play, And flitting spirits of the Earth and Air, Scatter'd sweet dreams and lulling music there. XI For she was well beloved by all th' immortal Beings that roam through Ocean, Earth, or Sky; And oft would blessed spirits pass the portal Of the vast Eden of Eternity To be her slaves, and to her did resort all Angelic thoughts, each heavenly phantasy, That mortals may not knowâall came to bless This gentle Being's dreams of happiness. XII And all around that fountain, the pure air Breathed of her presence; every leaf was hung With music, and each flow'r that blossom'd there A fine and supernatural fragrance flung On the glad sense; and thither did repair Garlanded maids, and lovers fond and young; And by the side of the low-murmuring stream Would youthful Poets lay them down to dream. XIII And ever on that spot the rays of Morning Fell thickest, and the Sun's meridian light Sparkled and danced amid the waves, adorning The crystal chamber of the sleeping Sprite. But when proud Dian walk'd, with maiden scorn, in The Eastern skies, and the sweet dews of Night Lay heavy on the Earth, that Sprite arose Fresh from the visions of the day's repose. XIV And then, she gaily wander'd through the world, Where'er her fancy led her, and would stray (The sails of her bright meteor-wings unfurl'd) Through many a populous city, and survey The chambers of the sleeping; oft she curl'd The locks of young chaste maidens, as they lay, And lit new lustre in their sleeping eyes, And breathed upon their cheeks the bloom of Paradise. V And she would scatter o'er the Poet's brain (As he lay smiling through swift-springing tears) A strange and unintelligible train Of fancies, and ring loud into his ears A long, mysterious, and perplexing strain Of music, or combine the joy of years In half an hour of slumber; till he started From such sweet visions, weeping and wild-hearted. XVI And, in her mirthful moments, would she seek The bachelor's room, and spoil his lonely rest; Or with old maids play many a wicked freak; Or rattle loudly at the miser's chest, Till he woke trembling; she would often wreak Her vengeance on stern fathers who repress'd Their children's young and innocent loves, and sold (Like our two Kings) their happiness for gold. XVII I can't tell half the merry tricks she play'd On earth, nor half the clamour and the fuss Old women made about her.âI'm afraid No Sprite was ever half so mischievous. But so it happen'd that one night she stray'd Into the Prince's chamberâ(prying Puss! I wonder what the deuce she wanted there With a young man a-bed, so fresh and fair.) VIII Tranquil and happy in his sleep he lay, For he was dreaming of that vision bright; And o'er his flush'd cheek stole a wandering ray Of silent but most passionate delight, As he was gazing his soul's eyes away On some imagined formâhe was a sight Of wondrous beauty, and Maimoune stood Gazing upon him long in solitude. XIX Oh! how she long'd to peep beneath the lid That veil'd his eyes' dark azure, and espy The sweet imaginations that it hid Wandering beneath its fringed canopy. Yet would she not awake him; all she did Was but one instant on his breast to lie, And kiss the lips which tremulously moved As if to meet the lips of her he loved. XX Hark! a dull sound swings through the troubled air! She hears the flapping of unholy wingsâ Awhile she listens, mute, with finger fair Raised to her delicate lips; then swiftly springs Into the infinite skyâwhat meets she there? Ha! a bad spirit in its wanderings Darkens the face of the full moon, and mars The pale-eyed beauty of the silent stars. XXI Up sprang Maimouneâwinds are not so fleetâ Through the spell-troubled atmosphere,âand soon You might behold those hostile Spirits meet Within the circle of the full-orb'd moon. Well knew the Fiend that battle or retreat To him was hopelessâso he craved a boon; That as her anger he was loath to stir, She'd let him pass in peaceâand he'd let her. XXII âHo!â quoth the Fairy (and she laugh'd aloud); âKind Sir Rebellious, courteous terms are these: But mine must first be thought onâSpirit proud, Now whether thy sweet Spritehood doth it please, That I should dash thee from thy murky cloud Into yon deep uncomfortable seas; Or shut those fair and dainty limbs of thine In the dark trunk of that wind-shaken pine? XXIII âOr wilt thou shiver in the realm of Frost, Ten thousand years fast fetter'd to the Pole? Or, to the centre of the deep earth toss'd, There tumble, free from Gravity's control, In many an antic gambol?âto thy cost Curst Spirit, thou hast dared meâfor a soul More dark than thou, more mischievously wicked, Roams not the earthâat least with such a thick head. XXIV âI've some old scores to pay you off, Sir, now:â Didn't I see you tap Tom Goddard's ale? Didn't you pull down Pocock's barley-mow? Didn't you nick the parson's pony's tail? Didn't you milk John Squizzle's spotted cow? And thump his sister with the milking pail? Didn't I see you through the keyhole creep, And give Miss Bab the fidgets in her sleep? XV âCan you say anything in your defence? Whate'er you will I'm ready, Sir, to hearâ What! silent!âhave you lost your little sense? Have you no means of making it appear That you possess a shadow of pretence To mercy?âare you quite struck dumb with fear? Come, I'll not waitâyou stupid Spirit, speakâ What mischief have you done, this many a week?â XXVI The Spirit trembled as he made reply: âMost beautiful MaimounÃ©, I confess That I must owe, henceforth, my liberty (Which I deserve not) to your gentleness. Much mischief surely have I done, yet I May, with some reason, venture to express A hope that I've, for once, refrain'd from doing My poor endeavour to engender ruin. XXVII âThere is a high and solitary tower Near China's proud Metropolis, and there As I pass'd o'er it at the midnight hour, Suspended in the vast and moon-lit air,â Lying in soft Sleep's poppy-breathing bower, I saw a maiden exquisitely fair!â You may conceive what charms must be her lot, When I assure you that I pinch'd her not! XXVIII âShe quite disarm'd me of my old propensities; I had no thought of doing any harm To herâI would not for the wealth of ten cities Have thrill'd that bosom with the least alarm. âWhat beauty!â I exclaim'd, âoh! how intense it is! How exquisite her neckâher handâher arm! Her lips!âoh! might I with a kiss surprise The slumbers hanging on those shrouded eyes.â XXIX âBut I breathed o'er her a profounder sleep, And drove away all images of fear From her repose; then softly did I creep, And whisper dreams of wonder in her ear. Thus, many a night, did I my vigils keep Beside her pillow, till she grew most dear E'en to my natureâby her eyes I swear The world holds not another thing so fair!â XXX âNow,â quoth the nettled Fay, âmine own I'd wager (Might I hold commerce with such things as thou, And wouldst thou dare in such a strife to gage her) That this thy beauty bears not such a brow Of loveliness (I don't mean to enrage her) As a young wonder whom I saw just now: And (what would more her female nature vex) My brighter beauty's of the other sex. XXXI âNay, since you look incredulous, Sir Fiend, I must your senses by strong proof convince; So beg that you'll this instant condescend To lay your sleeping Princess by my Prince In yon lone turretâback to China wendâ Bring hither this fair paragonâand since You dare to stake your judgment against mine, We'll see which beauty is the more divine.â XXXII She spokeâupon the word his raven pinions The dark-brow'd Spirit for the voyage spread, And to the Chinese Monarch's far dominions, Swift, straight, and fearless, through mid air he sped; Where (still unshaken in his old opinions) He bore Badoura, sleeping from her bed, And lodged her safely in the Prince's tower, Close by his side, in less than half an hour. XXXIII Had I but time I'd tell you how enchanting She look'd, when waving in the midnight breeze, As the strong Spirit bore her onward, panting With haste, o'er towns, and continents, and seas. In raiment her fair limbs were sadly wanting, For she wore nothing but a thin chemise; And, as the moonbeams bathed her in their light, She seem'd some wandering meteor of the night, XXXIV Or star dropp'd from the firmament; but when She lay still sleeping, by the Prince's sideâ The fairest she of womenâhe of menâ Both Spirits own'd, it could not be denied That Earth ne'er saw such beauty. Ne'er again Will such a bridegroom sleep by such a bride, And ne'er again, while we liveâI'm afraid, Will pranks so pleasant be by Fairies play'd. XXXV Awhile the Fairies bent in silence o'er them, Comparing lip with lip, and nose with nose; And for their beauty could almost adore them; But soon the old dispute again arose; And to such lengths their angry passion bore them, That they had nearly come from words to blows, But that the evil Spirit fear'd to fight With so confounded passionate a Sprite. XXXVI At length 'twas settled, with the full consent Of both, that the dispute should be referr'd (Since neither to resign the contest meant) To the unbiass'd judgment of a third: And they both swore that they would be content, When this their quarrel should be fairly heard, With his decision. So Maimoune call'd A Spirit whom her beauty had enthrall'd XXXVII For fifteen hundred years. The Spirit cameâ A creature form'd by nature for a lover; Blear-eyed, and bow-legg'd, hump-back'd, horn'd, and lame; I wonder how such beauty fail'd to move her: But she had never yet confess'd a flame, Though she had made this dainty Knight a rover, Since he first woo'd her, over seas and lands, Ten times a-day, to do her mild commands. XXXVIII In this behaviour did my Sprite resemble All mortal women whom I ever knew; Good Lord! I'm now, while writing, in a tremble, To think of all the labour I went through When I was courting Miss Jemima Kemble; Never had galley-slave so much to do: Never poor husband of a wife who chided Could lead, in this world, such a life as I did. XXXIX Well! I'm still single!âbut I can't forget How oft I've trudged for many a dusty mile On some ridiculous errand,âor got wet In expectation of at least a smile; And then, returning, found her in a pet Because âI'd kept her waiting such a while.â And then the shawls and tippets that I carried; The scrapes she led me intoâtill she married. XL Up rose the Spirit thus so deeply smitten, And most politely fell upon his knees; (His name can't be pronounced, and scarcely written, And so we'll call him Cupid if you please:) His mistress told him of the plan she'd hit on, And begg'd his judgment would the strife appease: And Cupid grinn'd, and look'd extremely proud, To have his taste in beauty thus allow'd. XLI But when he very carefully had eyed, With spectacles on nose, the sleeping pair, He gravely said it could not be deniedâ That they were both superlatively fair. He was extremely puzzled to decide Which was the more so, and could not declare To which his judgment would award the prize, Unless he was allow'd to see their eyes. XLII So said, so done;âthe magic spell was broken Which hung upon the slumber-sealed eyes Of the young Prince, and he was fairly woken From his sweet dreams; then, oh! with what surprise He saw the form beside him, a bright token Of the Gods' favour, sent to realize (As he supposed), the loveliest dreams that stole Across the enchanted vision of his soul. XLIII How came she there?âhe knew not, and cared less, That she was there was quite enough for him;â Bewilder'd in her dazzling loveliness, How did his eyes in giddy rapture swim! As she lay by him still and motionless, âThe cup of love was running o'er the brim Within himâ (as I heard a speaker say At a Salopian dinner yesterday.) XLIV I can't think how he took the joke so coolly, As if the Gods had chosen to provide And send him, as they ought, at midnight duly, A beautiful young lady for a bride. He never ask'd who brought her thither. Truly, Had I found such a treasure by my side, Nor of the trick been previously admonish'd, I should have felt prodigiously astonish'd. XLV Long did he gaze in silence and deep joy, And thoughts came o'er him which he ne'er had known; The dream which he had worshipp'd from a boy, In one short instant from his brain had flown; And a new love which knew of no alloy, Within his bosom had built up a throne. The lady slept, he gazed, and gazed upon her, But harbour'd not a thought against her honour. XLVI She slept on most amazinglyâhe thought (And I'm not sure he wasn't in the right) That she slept rather sounder than she ought, It being, he supposed, her bridal night. But though he deem'd it strange, he never sought. To force the slumbers from those orbs of light He almost fear'd to viewâhe could not bear To use such rudeness to a thing so fair. XLVII Yet did he print a most bewildering kiss On her fair cheekâanother on her browâ (I should expatiate on that moment's bliss, But haven't time to dwell upon it now,) They would have waken'd any living Miss, Whose sleep was not enchanted; but somehow This lady felt them not; or, if she did, Sleep still weigh'd down each persevering lid. XLVIII 'Twas all in vain; he found he couldn't wake her By-any gentle means; so, having sworn That she was his, and he would ne'er forsake herâ That she should never from his arms be torn, Even though Hell itself should yawn to take her,â He thought it would be best to doze till morn; And, having kiss'd her lovely cheek once more, Soon fell asleep more soundly than before. XLIX Forthwith, released from the strong spell that bound her In deepest slumber, fair Badoura sprung From her enchanted visions, and around her A glance of momentary wonder flung. Much did the aspect of the place confound herâ Where are the pictures round her chamber hung? Is this her bed?âand ah!âwhat heavenly face Lies on the pillow, in her Nurse's place? L She screams aloud!âis this a man beside her? A Husband?âGracious! is her Father mad? She is resolved, whatever may betide her, To flyâand yet the face is not so bad.â She has seen worse complexions,âmouths much wider,â In fact the fellow is a pretty lad. She thought she'd take one peep at him, and bent Silently o'er his face in wonderment. LI Upon her delicate brow the dark hair braided, Cloudlike hung o'er the starbeams of her eyes; Which, by that darkness soften'd and o'ershaded Fell in a gleam of tenderest ecstacies Upon the sleeping boy; that gleam pervaded His cheek still glowing from his late surprise; And touch'd his brow, which in that radiance shone With loveliness far brighter than its own. LII Thus (as 't is said,) Italian Beauty hung Over the sleeping Milton, as at noon Reclined he lay the forest trees among, His thoughts to some unutterable tune Of Heavenly Music wandering, till they sprung Into his deep-flush'd countenance, and soon Kindled within that gazer's breast the flame Which Woman, who best feels it, dares not name. LIII But there's one trifling difference between My Princess and the Dame who seem'd to ape her; That Milton's Beauty chose not to be seen, And scarce declared her passion e'en on paper: Whereas Badoura thought it would be mean To let so delicate a Youth escape her; All her objections to a ring were over, Since Fate had sent her such a handsome lover. LIV And she began to find it poor employment To gaze so long upon a sleeping spouse, And long'd for the more rational enjoyment Ofâconversationâandâexchanging vows Of loveâandâchaste caressesâne'er to cloy meant;â And so she strove the sleeper to arouse, At first by gentle kisses, and fond taps With her small fingers,âthen by ruder slaps. LV He only slept the sounder, so she tried At last the sweet allurement of her tongue; âSweet Prince!âDear Husband!âam I not thy Bride? Am I not chaste, and beautiful, and young? Have I not air, and shape, and grace beside? Is not my voice the sweetest that e'er sung? Why Husband! Husband! Husband!âSir! Sir! Sir! Good Lord! will nothing make this Blockhead stir? LVI âNow by mine eyes, fair Bridegroom, 'tis not right To sleep so sound at such an hour as this; Pray tell me, is it not our bridal night, Sacred to love, and harmony, and bliss? I've a great mind to quarrel with you quite, Discourteous Sirânow by this rapturous kiss, (Which I must steal, since you will not bestow,) I never could have borne to slight you so. LVII âAid me, ye Gods, this odious sleep to drive hence; Sir, you've caroused too freely at the wineâ No, no; I now perceive the whole contrivance, 'Tis all a trick, my kind papa, of thine. I wonder at my Nurse's base connivance; But oh! he looks so radiantly divine, And smiles, in slumber with a smile so sweet, I can't believe him guilty of deceit. LVIII âStill sleep'st thou, dearest? some malignant Demon Hath o'er thy spirit cast his baneful spell; Else never couldst thou in this fashion dream on, Nor against Love and Hymen so rebel, As not to let those eyes of beauty beam on The gentle Lady who loves thee so well: By Heav'n thou smil'stâI know it's all a sham; Love grant me patience!âwhat a wretch I am! LIX âThou lov'st me not; dost thou suspect my fame? My parents, Sir, are noble as thine own; My aunt Haiatelnefous was a Dame As chaste, and coy, as ever wore a gown: Ne'er have I felt,âtill now, Love's pleasing flame; My Father shall defend his Child's renown. Do as you please, Sirâyou shall shortly know That I'll have vengeance if you use me so. LX âBy the hot tears which I am shedding o'er thee; By my poor heart which doth so fondly ache; By these most chaste embraces; I implore thee, My Husband, if thou sleepest, to awake. Oh! didst thou know how madly I adore thee, Thou wouldst not thus persist my heart to break. Oh! hear the plaint my wounded Spirit pours, And heal my sorrow!âLord, how loud he snores!â LXI She spoke; the tears fell fast, as she was speaking, Yet did they yield her anguish small relief; And (what was shocking), in her flight from Pekin, She'd dropp'd her muslin pocket-handkerchief, So that she couldn't stop her eyes from leaking; Maimoune felt much pity for her grief, And soon, in order to assuage her pain, Sent Magic slumber to those eyes again. LXII By this the silver Moon had drawn her horn in, While Cupid still more undecided grew; And puzzled on, unmindful of the warning, Till, while he pored and doubted, the cock grew, And at the sound, before the breath of Morning, Back to their haunts, the three mad Spirits flew, Leaving, in rather an unusual place, The Prince and Princess lying face to face. LXIII The spells fell from their eyelids, and together These two fond lovers from their dreams awoke, And met each other's eyesâ'twas long ere either (Lost as they were in love and wonder) spoke. I don't know (and it matters not a feather), Which of the two the blissful silence brokeâ 'Twas a strange introductionâI'm afraid The breakfast hour that morning was delay'd. LXIV Of course the thing in matrimony ended; The Kings were much astonish'd at the way In which the Fairies had their schemes befriended, For how it happen'd not a soul could say. Maimoune and her Lover both attended, In high good-humour on the wedding-day; And brought fine gifts from Fairyland, and shed All sorts of blessings on the Nuptial Bed. LXV âNow strike your sails, ye jolly Mariners,â For I have come unto my story's end, With a few alterations, worthy Sirsâ To make it aptly to my purpose bend. I've used some freedom with the characters, But hope the Reader 'll kindly condescend To recollect my hurryâand excuse The rambling nonsense of a heedless Muse. DAY DREAMS. NO. I. TO ? I. I knew that Death was stern and strong, That sceptred hand and helmed head, The fear'd on earth, the famed in song, Must sink beneath his silent tread; That Poet's brain, and Warrior's heart, And Beauty's most resplendent form, Glory and pride, and strength, must part, To grace the banquet of the worm. But tell not meâit cannot be, That Death, my love, may alter thee. II. Oh! hast thou ne'er in fancy view'd The shadows dark of days to comeâ Their toils and cares, a hideous brood, Strife with the world's fierce multitude,â Pain, sickness, agony, distress, When yearns the heart in weariness Tow'rd absent friends, the dead, the lost, And those by fortune tempest-toss'd To some far-distant home? Though many an hour of love and mirth May cheer man's spirit here on earth, And friends may meet in moments gay, And the dancing heart keep holiday; Yet oh! far oftener must it bear Its solitary load of care, Aching in anguish deep and lone, For many a loved and loving one,â I'll not believe that at his birth To man such sympathies are given, But that their joys, so few on earth, Might be renew'd in Heaven. Then tell not meâit cannot be, That Death, my love, may alter thee. III. And hast thou ne'er, at fall of Even, When moans the breeze in sounds of woe, And stars begin to wink in Heaven, And earth in twilight melts below, And, in the stillness of the hour, The voice of waters solemn seemsâ Felt some unknown mysterious Power Breathe o'er thee, from the woods and streams, Steeping thy soul in tearful dreams; Till wandering thoughts spring up on high, As the soul would roam through the starry sky, And the realms of the sainted dead explore, Whom the living eye shall view no more, In the crystal light of their calm retreat, The look of Earth's affection bearing, And still their radiant faces wearing The smile we used to think so sweet? Thou must have felt that witching hour, Its deep, and calm, and silent power; Thou must have felt that tearful gushing From the heart's fresh and lonely springs, And the charmed soul through the blue sky rushing On the Spirit of Twilight's wings. Then rise, each sense to rapture hushing, Visions of unforgotten things, And they who loved, whose spirits love us, Float in the deep blue sky above us, In dreamlike wanderings. On every passing breeze float by Voices we loved in infancy;â They tell of some untroubled land, Where souls that love repose together, And many a white and radiant hand With gentlest motion waves us thither. And oh! 'tis sweet to rove on high With that celestial company, And feel, while yet we breathe beneath, That hearts remain unchanged in Death. IV. In sleep I dream of happy days, That smile beyond the tomb; And fond imagination roves Through wondrous valleys, fields, and groves, Where gentle brooks that gush between, And skies eternally serene, Make one perpetual bloom. And ever, in those dreams divine, Thy gentle spirit stands by mine; Thy voice of music wanders by, Thy form is floating in my view; And still thy soft and earnest eye Smiles on me, as 'tis wont to do. Then tell not meâit cannot be, That Death, my love, can alter thee. NO. II. I had a wondrous dream;âmethought I stood Within the threshold of an ancient house, Which I had loved in childhood;âforms well known, And old, familiar voices were around me, And happy thoughts, and half-forgotten feelings, And tearful recollections rose within me, Bathing each sense in ecstasy. I felt A gushing at the fountains of my spirit; My heart dissolvedâI was a child again. Yet as I gazed on each remember'd face, A freezing pang shot o'er meâa chill sense, Of longing separation, and I knew That woe was deeply blended with my dream. I gazed upon the forms around me. One (A matron) had methought been beautiful In other days, but now upon her cheek Sickness had set his seal, and wasting years And sorrow, worst of all;âyet still her mien Held its original sweetness. Piety, And gentleness and charity, and faith, Shone there, and from her soften'd eyes beam'd forth, Serenity which was not of the earth. And all around that venerable form Beautiful creatures floatedâcheeks of bloom, And eyes of watery light, on her alone Fixed with such fond and beaming earnestness, That I might know their owners had no thought Beyond that gentle lady's happiness. My dream was darkened; in that ancient house There was a deathlike silence;âone alone Of all those young and lovely forms remain'd, And she was traversing the silent hall, With wild and hurried footsteps. Very pale She look'd, and in her tremulous voice was sorrow Mingled with dreadâand yet she shed no tears. There seem'd a settled spirit at her heart, Triumphant o'er calamity,âa firm And holy strength; yet ever and anon Her lips, compressed convulsively, betrayed The struggle of her soul with agony. Methought one told me that o'er that old house Disease had spread his pinions, and that she, That gentle mother, and her youngest child, Were fading in Death's shadowy arms. Alone That maid, the ruling image of my dream, Tended their feverish beds, and sleeplessly Was comforting the agonies of each. Oh! 'twas most piteous to see that pale form Gliding from room to room, and when with faint And tremulous accent either sufferer ask'd How fared the other, forcing painful smiles, And striving with deceitful hope to win Each soul from half its suffering. And then Methought the tramp of horses, and the whirl Of chariot-wheels kept sounding in my ear; And, one by one, familiar forms pass'd by me, In sad succession, in that house of woe. They were my friends in childhood, and I sighed To see how thus with pallid looks they came To weep upon that lady's sepulchre. My dream pass'd darkly on. Methought I stood With her, the ruling image of the Vision, Beneath the waning twilightâ Again my dream grew dark. We stood by night, (I and that maiden) near the old abode, But a new woe was on us. Doubt, and fear, And thoughts of death, and undefined forebodings, Hung heavy on our hearts. Then on a sudden She had departed, and her wild farewell Was ringing like a death-knell in my ear, Which my heart echoed back.âI felt, that hour, As she were gone for ever. My brain reel'd Giddily, and dim shadows of dark thought Throng'd through its bursting cells tumultuously. I look'd up to the Heavens;âtheir face was dark With gathering tempest, and the silent moon, In pale and melancholy loveliness, Peep'd dimly through the clouds, whose shadowy forms The winds, in rapid and tumultuous flight, Hurl'd o'er Night's blue and starry firmament. My dream was brightened. Sounds of love and joy, And hymeneal songs, and rustic mirth, Mix'd with music of the village bells, Broke gaily on my ear. From that old house There pass'd a merry wedding rout;âthe bride Was that young maiden whom I late beheld Pining in hopeless sickness; holy love And chaste connubial raptures, filled her eyes, Smiling through silent tears. And then I saw That maid, the ruling image of my dream, And she was leaning on a young man's arm Whom I knew not; but in their eyes I read That each was to the other all in all. My Vision changed its aspect. Youth's bright hues Had pass'd from all the faces which I lov'd, And the calm pulses of maturity Throughout my being throbb'd. I stood begirt By beaming faces of time-honour'd friends, Whose children played around us,âhappy creatures, With cheeks and eyes of brightness,âsome in youth's More ripen'd bloom, maidens with downcast looks, And boys of gallant bearing;âpeace and joy Dwelt with us; the bright soul of other days Stole, like an exquisite dream, into our hearts, And childhood's scenes lay round us. And, methought, There leaned a radiant form upon my bosom, Dearer than all, from whose mild eyes I drank Intoxicating bliss; all pleasant thoughts Rose up within me, and each giddy sense Reel'd in its own deep raptures; till, at last, E'en with the beating of my heart, I woke. SONG TO THE SPRING BREEZE. I Oh! Spirit of the breeze, Who singest in the trees, Making low music, while the young leaves dance; Unveil, unveil to me Thy beauty silently, Let me thy bright eyes view, and dovelike countenance. II Oft doth my Fancy's eye The Naiads fair espy, Silently floating down some gentle stream; And glisten as it sees The green-rob'd Dryades, Or Oreads dancing nightly by their Queen's pale beam. III And I, on nights of June, Have watch'd, beneath the Moon, The gambols quaint of many a gamesome Fay, Around the tiny throne Of mirthful Oberon, And his capricious Queen, proud-eyed Titania. IV But, Spirit of the Breeze, Whose noonday melodies, And fragrant breath, soothe me so tenderly; In vain I strive to view Thy form's celestial hue, Too shadowy a dream art thou to flit o'er Fancy's eye. V Or art thou but a sound, In fragrance floating round, The whisper of some rural Deity, Who, stretch'd in grotto calm, With breath of purest balm, Is warbling to the Nymphs' delicious minstrelsy? VI Oh! happy wandering thing, Thus bearing on thy wing Refreshing coolness, fragrance, and sweet sound; How calmly dost thou stray Through groves and meadows gay, Still catching, as thou glidest on, new freshness from the ground! VII Thou breathest on my brow,â I feel thy kisses now,â Thy cooling kisses:âbut what charm was this? For oh! those kisses bore A joy unfelt before, A momentary, strange, imaginative bliss. VIII For my distemper'd brain Thou didst call up a train Of recollections sweet, which long had slept; Almost before my eyes I saw dear forms arise, And cherish'd thoughts and feelings from their deep cells crept. IX Whence was this wondrous spell? Thou sweet-voiced Spirit, tell;â Oh! com'st thou from mine own Salopian hills? Their freshness dost thou bring, Thou blessed gale of Spring, With soothing charms to win me from my dream of ills? X Oh! there did lurk beneath The fragrance of thy breath A dim emotion of remember'd joy; And in thy voice I heard Tones that my spirit stirr'd, The kindly tones that spoke to me, and cheer'd me when a boy. XI Hast thou not wandering been Amid those valleys green, Which bear the light print of my lov'd one's feet; And as thou glidedst by, Caught her most holy sigh? I felt, I felt its fragrance in thy kiss so sweet. XII And hast thou not stray'd o'er Sabrina's grassy shore, Sweetening thy cool breath with her springing flowers; And pass'd the cot where dwell They whom I love so well, Beneath their arching trees, and honeysuckle bowers? XIII Bear'st thou not thence along My dark-brow'd sister's song,â Her song so potent gentle hearts to move; Whose sweet and maiden tone, Perchance hath sweeter grown, Now blended with the quiet sighs and tender notes of love? XIV Or she, the mild-ey'd maid, Perchance by moonlight stray'd, Quietly gazing at the silent sky; When thou didst catch her thought, With such calm rapture fraught, To breathe it o'er my weary soul, deliciously. XV Oh! thou hast nought to do Upon the ocean blue, Filling with busy breath the mariner's sails; No worldly, dull employment, Thou bodiless enjoyment, Is thine, nor aught hast thou to do with wild and warring gales. XVI But peacefully thou roamest, And wheresoe'er thou comest, Breathest around the freshness of the skies; And on our hearts dost fling, From thy enchanted wing, Remembrances of absent love, calm thoughts, and happy sighs. XVII I know that thou art come From my far-distant home, And thy calm breathings tell what peace is there; But, gentle fay, returning, Say not my soul is burning With disappointment's bitter sting and comfortless despair. XVIII Say that my spirit knows Sweet moments of repose; That dear and happy musings still are mine; That Hope's bright dreams are flown, But many a lingering tone Of Memory's music lulls me yet to ecstasies divine. OCCASIONAL POEMS. SONNET I. TO POESY. Wonderful Spirit, whose eternal shrine Is in great Poets' souls, whose voice doth send High truths and dreams prophetic without end Into the blind world from those founts divine,â Deep adoration from such souls is thine; But I have loved thee, Spirit, as a friend; Woo'd thee, in pensive leisure, but to lend Thy sweetness to this wayward heart of mine, And charm my lone thoughts into joyousness. And I have found that thou canst lay aside Thy terrors, and thy glory, and thy pride; Quit thy proud temples for a calm recess In lowly hearts, and dream sweet hours away, Winning from sterner thought a frequent holiday. SONNET II. TO ?, ON HER VOYAGE TO INDIA. Now, like a shooting star, thy bark doth flee Over the azure waters, which convey Thee and thy soldier-husband far away From England's shores. Soon, soon on the wide sea, When the hoarse waves are moaning sullenly, And absent far is Friendship's cheering ray, Shall ye two know how mighty is the sway Of wedded love;âhow dear those fetters be Which the free heart doth wear. Oh! we who doze In tranquil homes, and with domestic mirth Season the warmth of the calm evening hearth, Can know but little of the love of those Who, in the lonely waste of sea and skies, Find home and comfort in each others' eyes. SONNET III. The gorgeous ranks of flaming cherubim,â The light, the rushing of unnumber'd wings,â The choral voices of the host that sings Unceasing anthems at the Throne of Him, Th' Eternal, the Unknown,âto me are dim And unattractive dreams;âmy weak soul clings To joys and hopes that flow from earthly things, E'en when the inward eye of faith doth swim In dreams that wander through eternity. I cannot long for unimagined joys; My trust is that hereafter I shall see Forms dear to me on Earthâthat many a voice Well known in Paradise shall speak to me, And earthly love be free from Earth's alloys. SONNET IV. TO A LADY, WITH A POEM BY A FRIEND. Lady! there's scarce a holier thing on earth Than the first dream of a young poet's brain; Therefore with reverence view this wayward strain, And should it, haply, seem of doubtful worth, Yet, as the premature but wondrous birth Of a great mind, respect it, and refrain From captious censure or cold scorn, nor stain Thy Spirit's brightness with unseemly mirth. Thou hast the vision and the soul divine, Exquisite thoughts, and fancies high and proud; And never, never, hath my spirit bow'd In woman's presence as it bows in thine; Nor have I found on earth a heart more fit Than thine to feel this lay and cherish it. SONNET V. So, froward maiden, thou wilt quit for ever Thy country and her many-weather'd skies; All old home-thoughts and early sympathies Abjuring, and wilt strive, with vain endeavour, To quench thine English spirit:ânever, never, Though herding with our natural enemies, May'st thou do this; for thou art bound by ties Which neither thou, nor time, nor fate can sever. Therefore, although thy children must not claim Freedom, the Briton's birth-right,âthough the song Of Milton be to them an idle name, And Shakspere's wisdom vain, thou wilt not wrong Thy country with cold scorn, nor think it shame To weep when thoughts of home into thy bosom throng. SONNET VI. TO ADINE. Lady! I know three poets who know thee; And all write sonnets, in the which they sware That thou art most superlatively fair, Meek, silver-voicedâand so forth. As for me, Not having seen thee, I am fancy-free; And, pretty lady, little do I care Whether thou art indeed beyond compare, A being to whom Bards must bow the knee, Or a mere woman, with good face and shape;â I only know that I'm so tired of hearing The list of thy perfections, that I gape Sometimes instead of duly sonnetteering; And therefore am I called brute, bear, and ape, And other names âpast mentioning or bearing.â SONNET VII. ON SEEING THE SAME LADY. I look'd on the pale face which poets love, And scann'd its sweetness with a stedfast eye; I listen'd to the eloquent witchery Of her low, plaintive song:âawhile she wove Her fairy meshes round me, and did move My soul to a wild worship. Then did I, By the strong aid of wakeful Memory, Whose sprites for ever at Love's bidding rove, Summon Ione from her silent cell. Sudden, in all the glory and the pride Of intellectual beauty, at my side She stood, and on my soul her bright eyes fell, Beaming with earnest thought.âI heard one tone Of her far voiceâand straight that phantom pale was flown. SONNET VIII. TO THE SAME. Oh! not for worlds, thou simple-soul'd Adine, Would I be loved by thee.âYet I confess That thou dost wear a deeper loveliness Than the most lovely whom these eyes have seen, Save Oneâand she is of a different mien; Wild-eyed and how wildhearted!âyet no less Fit than thyself a poet's love to blessâ My Gloriana bright, my Faery Queen! Thou, Lady, in thy meek, affectionate eyes, Bearest such magic as, I well believe, Few can resist; to me the charms they weave Spring from thy gentle wedded sympathies: And couldst thou less adore thy wayward mate, Oh! I should hate thee with a poet's hate! SONNET IX. In heaven âare many mansionsââwhat if thou, Hereafter cleansed from taint of mortal sin, By paths untrod by me, shouldst chance to win Some separate Paradise?âThe hope which now Soothes my bruised heart, and calms my sleepless brow, Oh! must it perish?âwhen the stormy din Of life is o'er, shall we not meet within The halls of heaven, as once my soul did vow? Oh! not for centuries of happy years, Would I endure that thought!â'twere hell to know, Beloved Friend, that all our hopes and fears, Yearnings, and dreams of future joy and woe, Hung upon different creeds!âWith fervent tears, I'll kneel, and pray that it may not be so! SONNET X. Now, lady, that our parting is so nigh, Fain would I think that thou, in future hours, Amidst thine own Dunedin's queenly towers, Or, haply, Scotland's mountain scenery, Wilt tow'rd the South turn no unkindly eye, No scorn to think of these poor woods of ours, And friends who dwelt in Windsor's sylvan bowers, And him who frames this sorry minstrelsy. Believe me, in no false or hollow guise Sing I to thee my parting madrigal; For I have found thee gentle, good, and wise, High-minded, simple-heartedâand withal Beloved of Her whose deep, soul-beaming eyes Hold my rapt spirit in such pleasant thrall. SONNET XI. SCOTCH QUADRILLES. Perish the coxcomb who united first To these vain whimsies, hatch'd beyond the seas, Old Caledonia's touching melodies; Wedding the follies of that land accurst, To strains whose high and soothing music nursed Heroic hearts, or gave crush'd spirits ease, Awakening the bright Past's remembrances While grief's fierce tempest o'er the Present burst. Oh! ye sweet notes, ye were not meant to lead The measured steps of fashion: ye should tell Of Highland glen, wild rock, and pastoral dell, And scenes like those of which the world doth read In that bright page, which many a wondrous deed Of Scottish story hath embalm'd so well. SONNET XII. Maiden, there's many a fairer face than thine Flitting to-night around me, many an eye As lustrous, locks as glossy in their dye, And haply some few shapes scarce less divine: Yet for no other brow must I entwine This coronal of rhymes; the time's gone by, When, like a lover, I could sit and sigh, And breathe despairing vows at beauty's shrine My gaze hath now grown passionless; yet long Have I, (poor foolish dreamer,) through the dance Track'd thee to-night amidst this glittering throng, Watching thy gay and artless countenance, And form that floats so lightsomely along With grace by nature fashion'dânot by France. SONNET XIII. Why dost thou haunt me with thy bright wild eyes Through the long sleepless night? when I should be Plodding through tomes of old divinity, And learning to be holy, pure, and wise, And worthy to obtain that twofold prize I pant forâImmortality and thee. Oh! my sweet friend, I fear my phantasy Clings to thee over fondly; in the skies I have no hope, no purpose, no desire With which thou minglest not; and if I lose Thy love on earth, I fear lest I should tire Of life's dull race too soon, and, in the dearth Of my twice crush'd affections, cease to aspire To the lone bliss of an immortal birth. SONNET XIV. Are there no marriages in heaven?âthen why Is earthly love so quenchless and so strong? Why doth the lover wish and yearn and long For bliss that dies not in eternity? No! no! the grave doth only purify Love's ore from its alloyâthe sordid throng Of earth's defilements, change, and chance, and wrong And jealous fears, and chill adversity. My Margaret, when I think on what thou art, How spirit-like a being, how refined From all that chains to earth our human heart, From all that now pollutes our human mind, I cannot think that death will tear apart The links thy magic round my soul hath twined. THE LAY OF THE LOVELY. I The mirth and music of the festal hall, And sunshine of bright eyes, had past away; And, till late slumber should mine own enthrall, Circled with deep tranquillity I lay; Thinking, (as Bards should think,) in amorous wise, Of those sweet faces and love-beaming eyes. II And soon upon my weary soul descended The dreamy sleep which is the Poet's waking; But still before my fancy's eye were blended The night's past joys, more rapturous still and taking Unearthly glory from the gleams which come, When sleeps the body, of the spirit's home. III I saw the many forms which I had deem'd So fair that fairer nought on earth could be; But now from out their Human Beauty stream'd Effulgence as of Immortality; And when they lifted up their gentle eyes, I saw swift thoughts and winged phantasies IV Throng thro' those azure gates, like gathering stars In summer-evening's sky; and when they spoke A sound more touching than the wild guitar's, Heard o'er the waters, on their lips awoke; Which did my ear in such sweet music steep, That my charm'd spirit could not choose but weep. V And then, methought, the Muse, (whom I adore,) In that wild dream was standing by my side, Who in her radiant hand a garland bore Of all sweet flowers which Nature's hand hath dyed And Nature's breath perfumed:ârich gems whose worth Decks the maternal bosom of the earth. VI Methought the Muse laugh'd archly in my face As she presented that fair wreath: âAnd now,â Quoth she, âSir Poet, 'tis thy task to place My sacred garland on the worthiest brow Of all that float, to-night, before thine eye, In this so fair and gentle company. VII âOh! pure and holy must the maiden be, Whose brow may be encircled by that wreath, Twined near the living spring of Castaly, When the world's eye was slumber-seal'dâbeneath The cold, calm gaze of the Queen-Moon, whose look No dream impure, no tainted thought can brook. VIII âAnd (for the Muses wove it) she must bear The Muses' lightning in her radiant eyes, Which (though most mirthful) must have tears to spare, In graver moods, to gentlest sympathies; She must be wise, imaginative, fair:â Now say what brow shall this bright garland wear.â IX It was an awful thing, (as ye may guess, Fair Ladies), to behold those visions bright, Which swam encircled in such loveliness As Spirits dream of, in my dazzled sight; Seeking the worthiest forehead among them Whose worst was worthy of a diadem. X And first two fair-hair'd sisters side by side I sawâthe graceful leaders of the dance: Of gentle aspect, mild, and thoughtful-eyed; And as I gazed on either countenance Almost I deem'd that they that wreath might share, And yet I felt a worthier brow was there. XI Next pass'd a delicate form, in whose deep eyes Beam'd the tranquillity of wedded love; Follow'd by one who, in more mirthful guise, Did like a spirit of the breezes move. Each was unutterably fairâand yet, I knew for neither was that coronet. XII And then came one, the Fairy of the Hills, With open brow and laughter-loving eye, And voice whose sound was as the sound of rills Gushing at summer-noon refreshingly; And she bent on me her bright, laughing eyes, As if, almost she would demand the prize, XIII But felt that one was worthier. Then there came A grave-eyed maiden of most gentle mien, Whose looks, elate with triumph, seem'd to claim, Not for herself, the glory of the scene, But for some honour'd friend.âAs on she pass'd Rose three bright formsâthe loveliest and the last. XIV One was array'd in the last splendid gleam Of parting childhood; on the verge she stood Of that sweet age, when life's first fairy dream Dissolves into the dawn of womanhood; And to her soul's young gaze were still unfurl'd Those radiant glimpses of an earlier world. XV The next had riper years; no longer child, And yet scarce woman; restless was her eye, And never, never hath on poet smiled A look more full of youthful ecstasy. It seem'd those wandering orbs could scarce repress The springing tears of the soul's happiness. XVI But who is she the last of that fair band?â Methinks the room grows bright as she advances, As from the touch of an enchanter's wand; And oh! what aspect can endure the glances, The piercing glances of those sunny eyes, Lit by gay dreams and rapturous phantasies? XVII On as she came, methought wild strains were heard Of such sweet music, that my garland bent Its quivering leaves, and every flow'ret stirr'd And trembled in that sudden ravishment, As if the Spring-breeze kiss'd itâThis is she, The child of Genius and of Poesy. XVIII Her Spirit was upon me, and I felt The might, and gentleness, and majesty Which in that fair and wild-eyed maiden dwelt; And, in my dream, I hasten'd joyfully Her brow to circle with the wreath divine. Whose was that brow?âIone, whose but thine. THE MANIAC. They say that the light of her eyes is gone, That her voice is low, and her cheek is wan; That her looks are sad, and strange, and wild, Yet meek as the looks of a sinless child. For the melting glance of her soft blue eye Is chill'd by cold insanity; And the beauty that her bright form wore, Is the shrine of a living soul no more. And her words discourse not music sent From reason's govern'd instrument; But, borne by her troubled fancies, stray, Like notes of the harp which the wild winds play. I would not look on her alter'd brow Nor her eye, so dim and soulless now; I would not view her pale, pale cheek, Nor hear her, in her madness, speak; Nor see her smile, she knows not why, While her tears flow down unmeaningly; Nor her vacant gaze, the piteous token Of a brain o'er-wrought, and a young heart broken; Noâon these things I would not look For the brightest gift in Fortune's book; For she was join'd with the fairest things That rose in my youth's imaginings. And oh! how oft have I turn'd away From a brighter eye and a cheek more gay, That my soul might drink, to sweet excess, The light of her pensive loveliness. But her languid eye shall charm no more,â Her smiles and her tearsâthey are nearly o'er; For found hopes lost, and a heart o'er-laden, Have crush'd, in her bloom, the guiltless maiden. TO HELEN. The gift, dear maid, which thou hast sent To gladden me to-day, I'll treasure as thy monument When thou art far away. 'Twill lighten many a dreary mood, To think how young, how fair, how good, How fancifully gay Was she whose smiles once deign'd to bless My spirit in its loneliness. The sunshine of thine open brow For me is nearly o'er, And dim forebodings tell me now That we shall meet no more: But thou art with the vision'd things, The dreams and dear imaginings, The treasured thoughts of yore, Which in my breast still swarm and play On many a mental holiday. Thy living presence, heartless one, Oh! bear it far from me; I know not what its charms had done Had I been fancy-free: But now e'en from thy smiles I shrink, And oh! 'twould break my heart to think That I was loved by thee; For, maiden, not that angel eye Must shake my soul's fidelity. Farewell! and if for aye we part, May grief ne'er cloud thy brow, Nor Fashion make thy guileless heart As coldâas mine is now. Yet, trust me, wheresoe'er I rove, I'll love thee with a brother's love, Nor thou despise my vow; But grant me still, in woe or weal, Such love as gentle sisters feel. SONG. I Here's to thee, my Scottish lassie !âhere's a hearty health to thee! For thine eye so bright, thy form so light, and thy step so firm and free; For all thine artless elegance, and all thy native grace, For the music of thy mirthful voice, and the sunshine of thy face; For thy guileless looks, and speech sincere, yet sweet as speech can be,â Here's a health, my Scottish lassie !âhere's a hearty health to thee. II Here's to thee, my Scottish lassie !âthough my glow of youth is o'er, And I, as once I felt and dream'd, must feel and dream no more; Though the world, with all its frosts and storms, has chill'd my soul at last, And genius with the foodful looks of youthful friendship past; Tho' my path is dark and lonely now, o'er this world's dreary sea,â Here's a health, my Scottish lassie !âhere's a hearty health to thee! III Here's to thee, my Scottish lassie !âtho' I feel that not for me Is thine eye so bright, thy form so light, and thy step so firm and free; Tho' thou with cold and careless looks wilt often pass me by, Unconscious of my swelling heart and of my wistful eye; Tho' thou wilt bless some happier love, nor care a jot for me,â Here's a health, my Scottish lassie! here's a hearty health to thee. IV Here's to thee, my Scottish lassie !âwhen I meet thee in the throng Of merry youths and maidens dancing lightsomely along, I'll dream away an hour or twain still gazing on thy form, As it flashes thro' the baser crowd, like lightning thro' a storm; And I perhaps shall touch thy hand, and share thy looks of glee, And for once, my Scottish lassie! dance a giddy dance with thee. V Here's to thee, my Scottish lassie !âI shall think of thee at even, When I see its first and fairest star come smiling up thro' Heaven; I shall hear thy sweet and touching voice in every wind that grieves, As it whirls from the abandon'd oak its wither'd autumn leaves; In the gloom of the wild forest, in the stillness of the sea, I shall think, my Scottish lassieâI shall often think of thee. VI Here's to thee, my Scottish lassie !âin my sad and lonely hours The thought of thee comes o'er me like the breath of distant flowers: Like the music that enchants mine ear, the sights that bless mine eye, Like the verdure of the meadow, like the azure of the sky, Like the rainbow in the evening, like the blossom on the tree, Is the thought, my Scottish lassieâis the lonely thought of thee. VII Here's to thee, my Scottish lassieâtho' my muse must soon be dumb, (For graver thoughts and duties, with my graver years are come) Tho' my soul must break the bonds of earth and learn to soar on high, And to look on this world's follies with a calm and sober eye; Tho' the merry wine must cease to flow, the song be mute for me,â Still to thee, my Scottish lassie! still I'll drink a health to thee. VIII Here's to thee, my Scottish lassie !âhere's a parting health to thee! May thine be still a cloudless lot, tho' it be far from me: May still thy laughing eye be bright, and open still thy brow, Thy thoughts as pure, thy speech as free, thy heart as light as now! And whatsoe'er may be my fate, my dearest toast shall be Still a health, my Scottish lassie, still a hearty health to thee! TO MARY. I My muse hath long with silence dwelt, My harp been long unstrung; I cannot feel as I have felt, Nor sing as I have sung. E'en to the verge of middle age I've brought my earthly pilgrimage,â My heart's no longer young; And, sooth, 'tis time, at twenty-seven, My muse should be the bride of Heaven. II Yet, Mary, ere I cease to float For aye on Fancy's sea, I'll freight once more my âcrescent boat,â With fairy gifts for thee: And thou, I trust, wilt not despise Such scant and sorry merchandize, Unworthy though it be Of him, who, in his better day, Was rich in rhyme and roundelay. III But if my lyre hath now decay'd, 'Tis not from age alone;â Sore havoc with its strings was made, Ere yet my youth was flown: And haply, Mary, thou canst tell Of one who nursed my fancy well, And rear'd it with his own, 'Till discord fell 'twixt him and me, And left meâwhat I now must be. IV My heart hath found a resting place Since then, at love's sweet shrine; And he, now freed from grief's embrace, Shall soon repose in thine.â A patient fight ye both have fought, To which shall found and fervent thought Look back in life's decline, When youthful passion's reign is o'er, And fancy's dreams delude no more. V 'Twill be a joy in after years, That I've beheld thy face; Have seen thee in thy smiles and tears, Thy goodness and thy grace; That I shall know, whate'er betide, How lovely and how loved a bride My friend's fond arms embrace; What beauty, worth, and talent shed Their brightness on his nuptial bed. VI And though beneath remoter skies Our lot must now be cast; Though different cares and sympathies Round each must gather fast; Though brief the computation be Of future hours which ye and we Together shall have past; And feelings, now too deep for tears, Must perish in the wear of years;â VII Yet still, in feeling's late decline, When Hope and Fancy flee, 'Twixt thee and me, 'twixt thine and mine, A bond of love must be: And though a month hath scantly flown Since first our friendship's seed was sown, I trust no time shall see Our souls bereft of thoughts like these, And yet more dear remembrances. âFORGET THEE?â I âForget thee?ââIf to dream by night, and muse on thee by day, If all the worship, deep and wild, a poet's heart can pay, If prayers in absence breathed for thee to Heaven's protecting power, If winged thoughts that flit to theeâa thousand in an hour, If busy Fancy blending thee with all my future lot,â If this thou call'st âforgetting,â thou, indeed shalt be forgot! II âForget thee?ââBid the forest-birds forget their sweetest tune; âForget thee?ââBid the sea forget to swell beneath the moon; Bid the thirsty flowers forget to drink the eve's refreshing dew; Thyself forget thine âown dear land,â and its âmountains wild and blue;â Forget each old familiar face, each long remember'd spot;â When these things are forgot by thee, then thou shalt be forgot! III Keep, if thou wilt, thy maiden peace, still calm and fancyfree, For God forbid thy gladsome heart should grow less glad for me; Yet, while that heart is still unwon, oh! bid not mine to rove, But let it nurse its humble faith and uncomplaining love; If these, preserved for patient years, at last avail me not, Forget me then;âbut ne'er believe that thou canst be forgot! EPITAPH IN WINDSOR CHURCH-YARD. FEBRUARY 20, 1828. Bright, tho' brief, were thy days on earth, For the light of genius crown'd thee; And we blessed thee for the sinless mirth Which thy presence pour'd around thee. Darkly the cloud of sickness came, And we saw thy beauty smitten; And our weak hearts droop'd, tho' we knew thy name In the Book of Life was written. But oh! as we knelt by thy dying bed, And pray'd in vain to save thee, By thy faith in Christ we were comforted, And the strength His Spirit gave thee. Sadly we turn from thy resting-place To the cold, hard world about us, And gird our loins for the Christian race, Which thou hast won without us. And we raise to Heaven our tearful eyes, And feel thou watchest o'er us, And shin'st like a star from thine own bright skies On the path thou hast trod before us. METRICAL ROMANCES. THE WITCH OF THE NORTH. And thus I won my Genevieve, My sweet and beauteous bride. Coleridge. INTRODUCTORY SONNET. From the lone silence of my dreamless cell A wizard voice hath call'd me:âI obey, And fain would greet that summons with a lay Which should outshine my brightest.âOh! 'tis well, That the last notes that ever this weak shell Perchance shall utter, thus should melt away, Hymning the name of that most gentle fay That e'er on Poet's spirit laid a spell! Come, my own Museâthou Feeling, who dost rest In my heart's inmost sanctuary; thou Who art the soul of all my musings blest, Dreams, wishes, hopes, affections! aid me now To twine for Her, the brightest and the best, A wreath which shall not shame her peerless brow. I There is a witch, whose freaks in English story, Ballad, or ode, have never yet been sung: Although 'tis said that poets, young and hoary, Sages, and wizards, at her feet have flung Rich tribute: warriors, from their dreams of glory Drawn by her potent charms, have meekly hung Their laurels on her threshold: lawyers wise Have bowed before the magic of her eyes. II Within a Northern cavern, dim and vast, This lady-witch was born: a twilight gleam Of everlasting icicles was cast, From the arch'd roof, on the maternal dream Wherein she was conceived; faint music past From the earth's bosom, while each breeze and stream Murmur'd and sigh'd delight, and every flower Breath'd tenfold fragrance on her natal hour. III A fairy form was her's and well she wore Its light aÃ«rial beauty; from her cave Into the Northern vapours, thick and hoar, When first she pass'd, a path the vapours gave To her, as to a sunbeam; the wild roar Of torrents paused, as o'er Loch Lomond's wave She glided like a zephyr; each fir-grove Grew bright in the effulgence of her love. IV Amidst the Northern forests, lakes, and hills, Her infancy was nurtured, and she grew Remote, and unacquainted with the ills Of the corrupted South: 'tis said, she drew Sweet inspiration from the rocks and rills, From the free air, and from the mountain dew Honi soit qui maly pense. Of her wild clime, and that her wizard ken Pierced far beyond the dreams of elves or men. V And to her beck, while yet she was a child, A thousand strange and savage natures came; Yea, whatsoe'er of wonderful and wild The grim North teems with, her sweet looks could tame; The kelpie crouched before her, when she smiled, With claws curled in, and eyes of softened flame; Brownie, and elf, and warlock, came to enrich The festal pageants of this wondrous witch. VI Her's was a reign of love; her mild dominion Was o'er the heart and will of living things; Her gentle voice could bind the eagle's pinion, Her gentle looks rob dragons of their stings: Yet more than thisâ'tis the received opinion, That the sly witch held secret communings With dread mysterious powers, and made her eye Familiar with the realms of phantasy; VII So that the Muses, from their viewless bowers, Would oft descend, obedient to her spells, And crown her forehead with Pierian flowers; With music and with light they fill'd the dells Wherein the witch abode; and she for hours, Would listen to their harpings, till the cells Of her most secret thought began to teem With shapes unknown to woman's brightest dream. VIII Some say that Germany sent forth her sages To do meet homage at the witch's feet, Bearing that wondrous science, hid for ages; The witch received them in her calm retreat, Heard them discourse, and, from their mystic pages, Drain'd secret draughts of knowledge pure and sweet, Which the fool scoffs at:âbut the witch well knew That this same knowledge was both wise and true. IX Thus childhood pass'd, but ere her young cheek shone With the first blush of womanhoodâere yet, Encircled in the Queen of Beauty's zone, The perfect graces of her form had met,â Ere her young heart had love's first rapture known, Or love's first sorrow made her eyelids wet, From her enchanted cell the witch went forth, And left the fruitful vineyards of the North. X What drew her from her solitude, and why, Quitting that mountain paradise, she came To shiver in our frosty Southern skyâ And whether on the tempest's wings of flame, Or on a broomstick, she thought fit to fly, No record now informs us; but the dame, Beyond all doubt, in after years, was found, Playing her wicked pranks on English ground. XI Beneath the shadow of a castled steep, In which the ashes of ancestral kings, Rocked by the roll of ages, soundly sleep,â Hard by a forest, where, in moon-lit rings, The fairies still those gamesome revels keep Hallow'd by Shakspere's sweet imaginings, The witch her dwelling fixed, and with strange power Raised, and adorned, a bright enchanted bower; XII Wherein, with potent cabalistic scrolls, And spells contrived by necromantic lore, And charm'd elixirs, mixed in magic bowls, Of power to penetrate the inmost core Of human hearts, and e'en in rudest souls Love's quenchless flame to kindle or restoreâ Framing strong lures to tempt and to betray, The wizard-maiden dwelt for many a day. XIII The deep recesses of her inmost cell Were garnish'd with strange treasures: lovers' sighs Fill'd many a magical receptacle, And tears were there, distill'd from rival eyes, In crystal phials, seal'd and labell'd well; And, mixt with these, lay quips and phantasies, And dark enigmas brought from FaÃ«ry-land, Which none but bards and witches understand. XIV And daily did the witch, by her sweet wiles, Increase these treasured hoards; pale youths would come, Laden with vows and raptures, miles and miles, To do her wayward bidding; friends and home Poets would barter for her thrilling smiles; And studious sages burnt full many a tome Of the old crabbed lore, that from her eye They might imbibe love's sweet philosophy. XV She had a chariot, which the muses brought her Built by themselves, shaped like the horned star Which gems the forehead of Latona's daughter, And drawn by winged dreams; and in this car Whene'er the witch was wearied with the slaughter Of Southron hearts, she used to roam afar Into the realms of shadowy thought, and spy The secrets of the land of poesy. XVI O'er the steep mountains, on the pathless air, Through the unfathom'd depths of the dim sea, Did these swift dreams the magic chariot bear, Wherein she sat unharm'd and terror-free; In heaven and earth's veil'd regions whatsoe'er Man's thought hath imaged, it was her's to see With an undazzled eye;âsuch power the Muse Into her favour'd children doth infuse. XVII The witch ne'er slept at night, but, in a trance, Within her car lay folded; the moon's ray Gilded her pale and tranquil countenance, As the fleet dreams conveyed her, far away, Through the star-spangled, limitless expanse Of this mysterious universe; she lay, Surveying all things, tho' it seem'd she slept, And, as the view might move her, laugh'd or wept. XVIII Her soul's deep eyes were open'd; in that hour All daylight's dull realities were laid Asleep, and in her flight was given her power To view the phantoms of the night, which stray'd Through human haunts; on many a young girl's bower She gazed, still haunted by her lover's shade; Gay dreams she saw, and fancies bright and fair, Couch'd on young eyes which had not look'd on care. XIX She saw the lean and dull-eyed Night-mare feed On the crown'd tyrant's breath; a demon foul, The fearful rider of that shadowy steed, From its black wings cast terror on his soul. While, one by one, full many a ruthless deed From the dark caverns of his conscience stole, Making sleep hideous:âin his prison cell, Meanwhile, the fetter'd patriot slumber'd well. XX And oft she saw the thirsty Vampyre drain The life-blood from the heart that loved him best, And the pale Goule, with terror and with pain, Gorge his foul meal, Death's lone and loathly guest. But there were gentler phantoms; love's strong reign The grave dissolves not; from their buried rest Maidens, in bridal white, and wives arose, To lighten many a broken heart's repose. XXI Throng'd by that pale and wandering company, The midnight streets seem'd busy, as by day, Save that no sound was heard, but silently Each phantom glided on its lonely way:â Meanwhile, in distant woods, the witch could see, Threading their moon-lit mazes, elf and fay; And many another wondrous sight was her's, Not to be dreamt of by philosophers. XXII These were her midnight pranks; by day, she wander'd In the fair bowers of old romantic lore; And now o'er Spenser's sweet creations ponder'd, And now o'er sweeter Shakspere's.âHell's dread door The Florentine unbarr'd to her; she wonder'd And wept o'er Ariosto's countless store Of sad and mirthful fancies; Milton gave To her the knowledge which o'er-leaps the grave. XXIII And, besides these, a household troop she kept, Of poet-genii, by her spells fast bound To work her will, and each was an adept In his own trade; some roam'd the world around From East to West, and never stay'd or slept, Till they the choicest phantasies had found And all the honey'd thoughts that might be worth The witch's quest, in heaven, or hell, or earth:â XXIV Which when these swift and subtle sprites had caught In their strong toils, straight to the witch's home (As bees their gleanings to their queen) they brought The nectarous freight, which to a honey-comb Of labyrinthine fancies others wrought; And all was treasured in a magic tome,â Some favour'd spirit's present:âbut the history Of this same present still remains a mystery. XXV Howe'er, 'tis certain that each page was fill'd With sweet and witching rhymes, while, day by day, Immortal ink the poet-genii spill'd, To swell the precious store, and many a lay Was weekly added, whose rich music thrill'd All gentle hearts, and bore men's thoughts away To a dream-paradise:âsuch wondrous skill These Genii had to work the witch's will. XXVI Yet, ere such fiery spirits could be tamed Down to complete subjection, charms were used, Too dreadful (save by witches) to be named, And many a potent herb was cull'd and bruised, And many a philtre mix'd and fetter framed, And many a mystic page full oft perused; For, of all sprites that roam beneath the sky, The wildest are the sprites of poesy. XXVII Philosophy hath grasp'd the lightning's pinions And tamed the rebel sprites of frost and snow, Hath ridden on the storm through air's dominions, And chain'd the myriad forms that sleep below Ocean's dread depths; but on her dearest minions Philosophy herself could ne'er bestow Power to control that wild fantastic brood, Which the strong magic of the witch subdued. XXVIII The wars, and all the triumphs which she won O'er these rebellious Genii, and the pains Wherewith she tamed them, when the fight was done, Are themes, too mighty for the puny strains Of a poor Southern bard:âbut there was one, A stubborn genius, whom, 'tis said, her chains Could scarcely bind; dread punishment had he, Which must be sung in saddest poesy. XXIX This Genius came from a fair Western land, A wilderness of woods and streams and vales, And rocks rough-hewn by nature's giant hand; And (if in old traditionary tales We may believe) on musings, lone and grand, His soul once fed, and he had spread the sails Of his broad wings for many a venturous flight, Which baffled e'en the wizard-maiden's might. XXX But he was sadly changed;âhis once proud wings, Which used to bear him, swift as Dian's sphere, Swifter than the moone's sphere.Midsummer Night's Dream. Through thought's vast realms, in rapturous wanderings, Hung weak and plumeless now; his leaf was sere, Though he had seen but four-and-twenty springs; And, on his lip, a cold habitual sneer Had quell'd thought's outward workings:âyou might trace Anticipated years upon his face. XXXI He look'd on beauty (though it pleased him well) With a most calm and unimpassion'd eye, As if he knew some antidote to quell The poison of Love's darts:ânone heard him sigh, Or any tale of amorous passion tell; But he would prate, with careless courtesy, To woman, or to witch, as might befall,â View their enchantmentsâand despise them all. XXXII 'Twas rumour'd of him, that, in former years, A crush'd and tortured victim he had been Of that relentless power, whose anger sears E'en super-human hearts: some anguish keen Had dried the inward fountain of his tears, And lent strange coldness to his heart and mien; And 'twas this coldness taught him to defy, As he long did, the witch's sorcery.â XXXIII Fool!âFool!âwith taunting and irreverent speech, And sneers, and scornful gibes, he durst provoke The spells and dread enchantments, from whose reach He seem'd secure; with many a bitter joke, He scoff'd at fays and witches, all and each, Vowing, that Genii who could wear their yoke Were mean and abject slavesâand chiefly they Who bow'd beneath the Northern witch's sway. XXXIV For in the North, this foolish sprite averr'd, No charms could e'er be forged, of force to bind A noble heart;âthe country, he had heard, Was peopled by the dregs of human kind;â A race barbarian, ignorant, absurdâ To thought profound, and genuine wisdom, blindâ As for the witchâshe might have tamed his betters, But he must still decline to wear her fetters:â XXXV Which when the lady knew, for wrath she tore Her raven tresses, while, from either eye, Flash'd a bright light, such as the vapours frore Kindle, at evening, in the Arctic sky; She knit her brows, and clench'd her hand, and swore, By all the nameless powers of sorcery, That, if to magic art she had pretence, The Genius soon should rue his insolenceâ XXXVI That night, the Wizard lady sat awake, Weaving dread charms in her most secret cell, And muttering rhymes which made all nature quake, Wherewith she was accustom'd to compel The strongest of her spirits to forsake Their favourite haunts in heaven, or earth, or hell; For, ere the morning, by their potent aid, A spell, to bind the Genius, must be made. XXXVII Anon they came;âpale dream and solemn vision Spread their light pinions at that awful call, And silently and swiftly, through the Elysian Portal, arose to her enchanted hall; AÃ«rial troops, in many a quaint division Ranged by their several leaders,âeach and all Observing, in the most respectful manner, The signals of Queen Mab's imperial banner.â XXXVIII And all night long, with swift, unwearied hands, Those patient spirits toil'd incessantly, Obedient to the witch's dread commands: Some brought strange herbs, some bruised them skilfully; Some for ingredients flew to the far lands Of fiery Ind, and spicy Araby.â Yet, all was finish'd ere the lark awoke, Or, through the darkness, morn's first twilight broke. XLVI What pass'd in that impenetrable drift Of supernatural hail, and rain, and snow, Is yet a secret, which, that man should sift, Fate wills not; so the world must never know Whether the witch's demons did uplift The Genius (some assert that it was so) In their strong arms, and bear him swiftly forth To some enchanted cavern in the North;â XLVII Or whether, by their dark, infernal power, He, on that spot, was cast into a trance, Wherein he saw more sights, in one brief hour, And feller, than e'er blasted waking glance;â Or whether pangs, that did his soul devour, Compell'd him (while, in swift and frightful dance, Those demons yell'd around him) to obey The witch's pleasure, boots not here to say: XLVIII But 'tis most certain, that, from that dire morn, His looks were strangely alter'dâthat his brow, Which such a steadfast calm of late had worn, Grew fever'd, and his eye was restless now: And if his lip still curl'd with outward scorn, 'Twas that no mortal eye might ever know The spell that did torment his inmost soul,â The secret fire, which he could not controul. XLIX O thou, whose wild, and oh! most potent verse Did, from the Tuscan Muse, such favour win As taught thee the dread frenzy to rehearse Of Charlemagne's most famous paladin,â If my deep reverence for thy strains could nurse, In me, a power and tenderness akin To thine, I might describe, in fitting strain, The pranks that spoke this sprite's distracted brain; L And how, at night, from his perturbed slumber He oft would start, and, with wild gestures, cry That Northern imps and goblins, without number, Were tearing him piece-meal remorselessly; And that strange fetters did his limbs encumber, And that strange visions danced before his eye:â And how, ere daylight broke, he used to wander Into lone woods, to poetise and ponder. LI Sometimes, in moody and abstracted fit, He sat for hours, and then would start, and swear The North produced all genius and all wit,â All that was bright, and wonderful, and fair; And that no poesy was ever writ Which with the Northern could at all compare; And that?but he discover'd, in a word, That all his former notions were absurd. LII And from the boldest and most scornful sprite That ever mock'd at necromantic power, He grew a slave, tamed down and humbled quite The most submissive in the witch's bower; And did her bidding meekly, day and night, Toiling, at her command, through sun and shower; And ran, and flew, to please her, miles and miles, And never ask'd for wagesâsave her smiles! LIII And his old pinions, which had droop'd so long, (As if he had been moulting,) soon began To reproduce their feathers, fair and strong, Of hues unnumber'd, like an Indian fan; So that, again, through all the realms of song He soar'd at will, and wheresoe'er he ran Or soar'd (as you may guess) he brought each sweet, That he could gather, to the witch's feet. LIV Yet was he discontented, though subdued; For the fair witch would never smile on him;â Witches, in fact, it should be understood, Like mortal maids, are sometimes ruled by whim. Whence this most cruel witch esteem'd it good To fill his soul e'en to the very brim, With adoration of her charms, that so Her cold despite might work him fiercer woe. LV Therefore, not yet abandon'd she her wiles, But rack'd his bosom still, and, when she saw His eyes fixed on her, oft would lavish smiles On many a peacock, whom he deem'd a daw In pilfer'd plumes,âbase rabble that defiles A poet's pen,âfops learned in the law,â Coxcombs, and drones, and dandies,âbrainless knaves, Who the poor Genius wish'd were in their graves. LVI Ye he complain'd not,âbut ador'd her still, In dumb and patient hopelessness;âsuch fear Temper'd his love, such charms were wont to thrill His sinking heart, whene'er the witch was near; Yet oft with secret tears his eyes would fill, And when he deem'd that no intrusive ear O'erheard him, in wild words of rage and grief, The fulness of his bosom found relief. LVII Still rail'd he not on her, but madly flew On her chief minions, with irreverent gibes, And stung them, with keen satire, thro' and thro', Reviling the whole race, through all its tribes: He laugh'd at all her lovers old and new, And call'd them rogues, and dolts, and lying scribes; (To jeer at folks, who were esteem'd so sensible, It must be own'd, was highly reprehensible.) LVIII And then he vow'd by those love-beaming eyes, It was a grievance not to be endured, That some vain, shallow, witless imp should rise, And of the witch's favour reign assured,â Nayâhaply make her very heart his prize,â While he, a spirit to her tasks inured, And gifted with high power to work her will, Was thus cast off,âdespised,ârejected still! LIX This could not last:âOne day, the Magic Book Fell in his way, (by chance or by design), And, tempted thus, these artful means he took To end his grief;âin many a mystic line He traced (although his hand with terror shook) His soul's most secret workings, in such fine And subtle phrase involved, that none but She, For whom 'twas meant, could solve the mystery. LX And he petition'd (this presumptuous elf) That, if his lady's heart was yet unwon, He might adventure for the prize himself, And do whate'er by prowess could be done, To throw all rival suitors on the shelf,â Adding, with grave audacity, that none (Save only He) were competent to prize, According to their worth, those soul-lit eyes. LXI And then he vow'd, with many a solemn oath, That should the witch e'er deign to let him be Her earthly guide, he then would plight his troth To serve her with most strict fidelity, And show her all his wonders, nothing loth; For he possess'd Apollo's master-key, By which are open'd, to the sons of verse, The hidden chambers of the universe. LXII And that with love which none but poets feel, And reverence such as none but poets pay, He would watch over all her future weal, And deem her his sole treasure, night and day; And when Death's slumber should her eyelids seal, And her soul flit to Paradise, away, Still, upon earth, her sacred name should be Link'd with his own in Immortality. LXIII Here pause we,âfor the night is on the wane. Whether the Genius still was doom'd to grieve, Or some kind fortune eased him of his pain,â Is matter which, in verse, I yet may weave:â But months must first roll by,âfor such a strain Is fitter far for some calm summer eve Than for these merry winter nights, when we Begin to dream of Christmas revelry. SIR LAUNFAL. INTRODUCTORY SONNET. In youth's wild fervour, ere my heart had yet Submissive bow'd to the acknowledged sway Of loftier duty, did I frame this lay, Which haply 'twould be wisest to forget, Mingled as 'tis with food for late regret,â The unpruned blossoms of my wit's warm May;â Rank wild-flowers, more fantastically gay Than now beseems my sober coronet. Yet chide not, thoughtful reader, though thine ear, Attuned already to my graver strain, These sportive warblings listeth not to hear, Nor deem them altogether base and vain, Though ill accordant they perchance appear With the ripe produce of my heart and brain. CANTO I. I King Arthur, in the tenth year of his reign, Fell sick of the blue devils:âby his court So many a brace of dragons had been slain,â So many giants, with their crimes, cut short,â So many wrongs avenged, and castles ta'en, That there began to be a lack of sport. The realm, in fact, from Cornwall to the border, Was in a shocking state of peace and order. II For six whole weeks, the Knights of the Round Table, From morn to night, had nothing else to do Than saunter from the palace to the stable, Play with their falcons, or their ladies woo, Polish their arms, and laugh (when they were able), At their own languid jests: no mortal knew, Till dinner was announced, what he'd be at; And King and courtiers all were growing fat. III The game laws were enforced in all their rigour, And several peasants were convicted fully Of breaking dragon's eggs, and pulling trigger At giants with two heads, who chose to bully Their frighten'd children; but with all the vigour Of the police, the court went on but dully; It seem'd the British fair were past affronting,â And then a frost set in, which spoil'd the hunting. IX As for the ladies, they, poor souls, declared That âthey certayne for dullness shulden dye;â The formal knights so prosed, and bow'd, and stared With their demure, old-fashion'd courtesy; And poor Sir Tristram, who could ill be spared With his gay jests, and harp, and poetry, In a late fray had got a broken head, And was not able yet to leave his bed. V In short, Miss Edgeworth's demon, pale Ennui, Had seiz'd on the whole court with dire aggression; And made it stupid as a calm at sea, Or wedlock after half a year's possession, Or poor Lord Byron's last new tragedy, Or octave rhyme, when stripp'd of its digression; Or any pitch that human dulness reachesâ Save that of Mr. Hume's financial speeches. VI I said the king fell sick (he kept his bed), With the blue devils:â'tis a sore disease, Worse than all fevers, yellow, green, or red, The jaundice, or âthat worm i' the budâ one sees On the pale cheeks of hopeless lovers fed; And if you wish to know the remedies With which it should be treated, go and look In Doctor Burton's valuable book. VII 'Tis a complaint that's chiefly incidental To lovers, drunkards, scholars, kings, and bards; To country squires with an encumber'd rental, And gamesters apt to hold unlucky cards. Bards bear it best;âto them it's instrumental In spinning rhymes: there's Chauncey Townshend lards His groaning stanzas (just to eke his strains out) With gloom enough to blow ten Frenchmen's brains out. VIII The symptoms vary with the sex, condition, Taste, temper, habits, constitution, age, And fortune of the patient;âif a rich one, It makes him fretful, puts him in a rage With wife, friends, children, servants, and physician;â If poor he's apt to quit the world's dull stage With a sore throat;âit makes the lover sad, The gamester gloomy, and the poet mad. IX Old ladies call it âfever on the nerves,ââ A name of universal application, Which for all sorts of peevish humours serves, And gains for some cross people, toleration Of such ill-bred behaviour as deserves (To say the least), a handsome flagellation; A mode of treatment which I own that I, In ânervousâ cases often long to try. X Of this I'll say no more; because I hear A better poet is just now preparing A work upon the subject, to appear In Mr. Knight's best type and paper, bearing The title of âBlue Devils,â and I fear 'Twould seem absurd, in one so often wearing Their livery as myself, to act physician To others haply in no worse condition. XI I wonder whether Mr. Wordsworth's yacht, That fine sky-cruiser, called the âCrescent Moon,â Might upon reasonable terms be got To bear my Muse and me, some afternoon, âAbove the smoke and stir of this dim spot, Which men call earth;â for I'm quite out of tuneâ Made hippish by eternal common-placesâ And business,âand uninteresting faces. XII There's nothing in the world (that is in Trinity) To make us poets happy;âI detest Your Hebrew, Greek, and heathenish Latinity, And Mathematics are a bore at best; And as I'm one who feel the full divinity Of a fair face in woman, I protest I'm sick of this unvaried regularity Of whisker'd cheeks and chins of black barbarity. XIII 'Tis a vile worldâa world of dung and draymen, And filthy streets, and noises beyond bearing; Knife-grinders, fish-wives, ballad-singers, gay men (Though last not least) carousing, shouting, swearing, So as to shock both clergymen and laymen, Haunt me o' nights; and I can't take the air in The morning, but I'm bor'd with butcher's shops, And markets, and prize odes,âand hay,âand hops. XIV In me these things breed legions of blue devilsâ These, and some thoughts which will not pass away, Of powers abused by Fancy's wayward revels, Of many a reckless rhyme and useless lay; While the dark future, with its hosts of evils Muster'd in grim and menacing array, Looks none the brighter for the thought that I Have been the marrer of my destiny. XV And that fond dream, which lured me on for ever Through a long boyhood, saying I might earn The poet's laurel with serene endeavour, And write my name on an enduring urn, Hath now departed; while ambition's fever, Unquench'd, though aimless, hath not ceased to burn With self-exciting fire, and thirst supplied By longings which can ne'er be satisfied. XVI Here am I now, at twenty-three, inditing Dull verses in a style which I despise, And once abjuredâjust when I should be fighting With nobler weapons for a brighter prize; But that no longer have I hope or might in My soul, to rush at famous destinies; No occupation for my pen more meet Than scribbling nonsense at so much per sheet. XVII âTime's past,ââI should have nurs'd the seed, and cherish'd The weak spring blossoms which shall bud no more, And water'd their young roots before they perish'd, From the rich founts of old poetic lore; And in the beams of high devotion, nourish'd Their growing ripeness, and laid up a store Of thought, and kept my fancy in control, And made the Muse, task-mistress of my soul. XVIII I should have been more cautious in my diet, Eaten less butchers' meat, and drunk no wine; Not suffer'd heart or head to run such riot; Lov'd but one maid, instead of eight or nine; Kept all my pulses steady, cool, and quiet; And then my poems would have been divine. Whereas I've been so wayward and unwise As to waste all the better sympathies. XIX Affections, tastes, and impulses, which should, Under the care of Study and of Nature, Have fed my spirit with the proper food, And made it reach the true poetic stature. I should have then been strong, and wise, and good, In short, a very different sort of creature: Yet my friends like me still (at least I think so,) Which is the reason why I eat and drink so. XX But thou, Ione, wilt thou not despise Thy poet for this vain and heartless song?â Wilt thou not tell him with upbraiding eyes, That he hath done his better nature wrong, Mingling with base and ribald phantasies Some thoughts which to a deeper vein belong, And idly mocking at the gifts which he, With his first love, did consecrate to thee? XXI Oh! 'tis most trueâtoo justly thou disdainest The wretch who still (though hopeless) half aspiresâ Alas! I know the heart in which thou reignest, Should be a temple for all high desires, Pure thoughts and noble darings;ânot the vainest And basest that ere felt poetic fires;â And yet couldst thou but know how thou hast been My dream, my star, my radiant Faery Queenâ XXII How, ere that silent phantom, which I fear'd, Had ceas'd to haunt me with its blighting eyes, And, in my dim horizon, Hope appear'd, My spirit turn'd to thee, and hung with sighs On thy sweet image, in the region spher'd Of its lost dreams and sainted memories; And how each meaner wish I did remove, That I might love thee with a perfect love; XXIII Couldst thou know thisâbut why do I awaken Vain thoughts and idle yearnings? am not I By the sweet sunshine of thine eyes forsaken? Am I not far from every social tie? Hath not each hope of my fond soul been shaken, Save one which wanders through eternity? And shall I still avert a lingering glance From the lone path in which I must advance? XXIV Must I not waste the best years of my youth In a cold, barren apathy, uncheer'd By the kind looks of love and constant truth, And beauty by her radiant smiles endear'd, And children's voices?âand shall I forsooth, Still madly hope my verse may be rever'd In my land's language?âthat I yet may shrine Thy name, Ione, in a living line? XXV âWisdom doth live with children round her knees,â Says Wordsworth; and he says what's very true; But then to nurse the children, if you please, I must possess the children's mother too; Indeed, without such trifling aids as these, I'm very sure my muse could never do; Her nature is gregarious and abhors All cross old maids and moody bachelors. XXVI Spirit, which art within meâor art not, (I rather think the latter, and you know In the year twenty, when my blood was hot, I took the liberty to tell you so,â At least to hint some notions which I'd got Just then, that all your flash, and smoke, and glow, Was quiteâor very nearlyâall my eye,â A sort of barren fancy's tympany; XXVII The passage I allude to you may find Not far from the beginning of Godiva,) I now request you, with a sober mind, To tell me your intentions, and not drive a Poor creature like myself, who's nearly blind, On a blind errand; tell me whether I've a Chance of succeeding in your trade, and whether You'll aid me soon, or cut me altogether. XXVIII In fact, Miss Muse, there's been enough coquetting, During the last six years, 'twixt you and me; And boyish follies scarce are worth regretting; But now I've fairly taken my degree, And shut my Euclid up, and should be getting Grave, for you know I'm turned of twenty-three: A point at which you'll own its nearly time To think of Reason more, and less of Rhyme. XXIX I must digress no further; if I do, I shall forget my subjectâlet me see, Where was I? oh! just where the devils blue Had seized on his Britannic Majesty; Five days he languish'd till his illness grew Into a deep and dull melancholy, (I accent that last word in the old way,) And the physicians scarce knew what to say. XXX The privy council in great haste assembled On the sixth day, and held a long debate; The courtiers all look'd blue, the doctors trembled, And bulletins were posted at the gate, Telling the world it could not be dissembled That the King's health was in a dangerous state: Though not a soul, of all that saw or heard of 'em, In that unlearned age, could read a word of 'em. XXXI Anon throughout the kingdom flew a rumour That 'twas quite sure his Majesty would die Of this inveterate melancholic humour; 'Twas said he loathed his victuals, and put by Bottle and bowl, and nothing could he chew more Substantial than his favourite furmety, (Which I can't say I like)âa dreadful tissue Of mortal signsâand then he had no issue; XXXII Having been much too busy, all his life, To think of marriage; so all sorts of fears, In every loyal breast, of course were rife, And mobs were all together by the ears, Ready to settle, with club, fist, or knife Who was to tax them; and ambitious Peers Were promising, intriguing, and controlling, Imploring, threatening, bribing, and cajoling. XXXIII The ladies had begun to buy their mourning, Black silks had reach'd a most unheard of price, And all the master tailors had had warning To raise their workmen's wages in a trice: When lo, at eight o'clock one sunny morning, The air was darken'd, and it thunder'd thrice; And, as the last peal sunk, was heard the whirling Of the dread wheels which bore the wizard Merlin. XXXIV An aged wight was he in Arthur's time,â I should suppose five hundred, more or less; (It's not exactly fix'd in the old rhyme, And therefore what I say is merely guess) Which is, in fact, a necromancer's prime,â Those scoundrels lived on to as great excess As fellows of King's College, who (as I Know to my sorrow) very rarely die. XXXV I wish I'd time to trace his generation, Just as I find it in the old romance, Which is replete with useful information, From ancient lore of England and of France; But I must hasten on with my narration, Leaving the reader, as he will, to glance O'er the said tale, or waste his time and wits on That prince of puppies, Mr. Joseph Ritson. XXXVI 'Tis a fine subject, and if e'er hereafter I chance to find the talent and the time, Perhaps I'll make the public die with laughter, By telling the whole tale in octave rhyme; In which I can be gay, or grave, or âdaft,â or Pathetic, or sarcastic, or sublime, Just as the maggot bites;âthe reader can see My fancy guides me, and not I my fancy. XXXVII In that great poem shall be fully shown All Merlin's true adventures, duly dated, And mix'd with curious matter of my own,â His life and his opinions, well narrated, And how he was, at last, by love o'erthrown, By a false, cunning beauty captivated, The Lady of the Lake, who bound him sleeping, In a sea-cave, where still he's in her keeping; XXXVIII But will return (as many people think) Some day or other to his works in Wales, Where you still hear his magic hammers clink Under a rock that overhangs the vales Of the âswift Barry;ââthere his demons swink, And strain, and pant, and lash their forked tails, Cursing the spells which bind them to their pain, Until their masters shall come home again. XXXIX His forte, it seems, was magic, in which none, Who came before, or after him, have taken So much delight, or half such mischief doneâ Not Doctor Faustusâno, nor Friar Bacon; 'Tis said he could eclipse the moon and sun, Put out the stars, stop comets, and awaken Or lull to sleep the ocean, as he chose, And play a hundred more such pranks as those. XL What progress he had made in mathematics Is what at present I shall not dispute on, Because I've scarcely learnt to solve quadratics, And am not over-perfect in my Newton; Though I once read as far as hydrostatics, Hoping some higher ground to set my foot on, And twine my laurel round the wooden spoon,â But 'twas an honour I despair'd of soon. XLI Nor have I ascertain'd (I own with grief) Great Merlin's metaphysical whys and whencesâ It seems that he'd a proper disbelief In those notorious liars call'd the senses, And (I incline to fancy) found relief, Like Berkeley, in exposing the pretences Of the material worldâwhose notions I (As suiting my convenience) mean to try. XLII Oh! 'tis most soothing, when all objects seem Wrapt in a sevenfold cloud of fear and sorrow, To know they're nothing but a hideous dream, From which, no doubt, we shall awake to-morrow To sober certainty of bliss supremeâ Hence consolation for all ills I borrow, By disbelieving, with my whole ability, All things that wear a shade of probability. XLIII I don't believe in matterânor in spirit; I don't believe that I exist, not I,â Nor you, Sir, neitherâif you choose to swear it, I tell you, very fairly, that you lie; If you think fit to thresh me, I can bear it, Knowing the thumps, in fact, are all my eye; And that all sorts of fractures, hurts, and bruises, Are as unreal as the patient chooses. XLIV I know I'm lord of all that I survey,â Maker and sole proprietor; I made The sun that cheers me with his winter ray, The woods that cool me with their summer shade; I made the dinner I shall eat to-day; I made the meadows where my childhood play'd; I made myself, and (tired of single life) I've half a mind to make myself a wife. XLV And round her vision'd form, at my command, All sweet affections, and gay hopes shall throng,â Desire, and love, and joy, a radiant band, Made trebly radiant in the light of song, Lo! at her feet two beauteous children stand, Whose looks are âperfect Gerard,â Mine eye hath well examined his parts, And finds them perfect Richard. King John, Act i. Sc. i. and I long In my fond arms, with passionate love to strain herâ Andâwish the vision was a little plainer. XLVI And oft I listen, through the livelong night, To the low, wave-like music of her breath, And kiss her eyelids with a wild delight, And haply hear her, as she slumbereth, Talk to me in her dreamsâbut if I write Much longer in this style, 'twill be my death; So we'll return to Britain, and find out What Doctor Merlin's visit was about. XLVII Of course he was admitted sans delay, Though the whole Palace was in sad confusion; Through crowds of gaping courtiers he made way To where the King, with dressing-gown and shoes on, Was gravely wasting, in great pomp, away;â He bow'd, and said he âhoped 'twas no intrusion, Though for so many months he had been absentâ But a late vision, by his sister Mab sent, XLVIII âHad told him that his Majesty was ill; So he had come directly from Caer-Mardin, To offer the assistance of his skill, For (though he said it) there was nought so hard in The power of blister, bolus, draught, or pill, But he could cure itâand not charge a farthing. He begg'd the Monarch would put out his tongueâ How long had this disorder on him hung? XLIX âWhat was his diet?âdid he sleep at night? His pulse seem'd languidâhow did he digest? Had he retain'd his usual appetite?â Pray did he feel a tightness at his chest?â He thought 'twas want of exerciseâhe'd write A short prescription, which to him seem'd bestââ This fragment of it's extantâthe style's eligible, And (like all Doctors' Latin) quite intelligible. L Rex Arthurus, Diabolis Coeruleis Aeger, ob desiderium Gigantum Decollatorum in Calendis Juliis, Sal. matrimon. quotidie capiat quantum Suff. et conjugialibus aculeis [Versus desideraturâunus tantÃ¹m] Haustu matut. merid. et vespertino. Rix. pulv. pil.âFiatâauct. M. D. Merlino. LI The meaning of the document is plainâ The King was dying of a quiet life, And therefore Merlin wisely did ordain That he should take unto himself a wife; After which treatment, should he e'er again Complain of any lack of noise or strife, Merlin acknowledged a disease so tragic Would baffle both his medicine and his magic. LII I'm sadly weary of this cantoâwell!â I must make haste and end itâArthur started At this advice, as though some sudden spell Had seized him, and, though far from chicken-hearted, His courage for a moment fairly fellâ 'Twas the first time it ever had departed, Though he had seen strange sightsâthis sudden terror The wizard noticed, and produced a mirror. LIII âMy liege,â said he, âthis wondrous glass, created By cunning spirits of my Father's breed, (Which for such works is justly celebrated) Possesses such strange virtue, that you read In it all future matters, which are fated To beâor not to be; so in this need I've brought it, that your Majesty may view Some things of moment, which 'tis time you knew. LIV â'Tis the same glass which Lady Britomartis Consulted, with success, some years ago, Fairy Queen, Book III. canto ii. And, I may say, has satisfied all partiesâ May I request your Majesty to throw One glance upon it? you shall see my art is Able some strange foreknowledge to bestowââ The King complied, and sullenly and slowly His head upraised from that deep melancholy: LV But scarce upon the mirror had his eyes Rested, when thro' their orbs quick lightning shot, And, with a sudden flush, the blood did rise Into his sunken cheeks, and made them hot, âPaining him throughâ with rapturous surprise; All the blue devils were at once forgot; And you might hear his pulses, as he gazed On the bright phantoms in the mirror raised. LVI âThe appearance instantaneously display'dâ (I borrow that last line from the Excursion, And have not much improved it, I'm afraid, By tipping it with rhyme, to fit my version) Was of a beauteous and majestic maid, In a fair garden taking her diversion, Like Emily in Chaucer, when her far sight Captured the captive Palamon and Arcite. LVII â'Twas summer, and the sun had mounted high;â The Earth beneath his fiery kiss was panting, With close, quick throbs of murmurous ecstasy, (The last two lines which seem to me enchanting, Are copied, in great part, I can't deny, From Coleridge, whom I scorn to be supplanting In the world's favour) while on Arthur's soul Sweet sounds of whispering winds and musical waters stole. LVIII And straight, within that mirror's charmed space, Rose a fair garden to his wondering eye; A still, secluded, and delicious place, With terraced walks, and trees upshooting high, And crystal streams, that ran a pleasant race, And fairy grottos, fashion'd curiously With shells and glittering spars, and odorous bowers Bright with all mingled hues of faintly-breathing flowers. LIX And near a spacious fountain, which was flinging An everlasting dew into the shade Of sun-proof branches o'er its margin clinging, So that no flower in that sweet spot might fade, But a fresh perfume was for ever springing, There lay upon a bank a radiant maid; Who, as it seem'd had thither strayed to shun The noon-day fervour of the summer sun. LX Her figure was right royal, and her mien (As on that flowery bank reposed she lay) Such as might well become a sceptred queen; Around her was a band of virgins gay, Fairer than any uncharm'd eyes have seen: But their sweet mistress was more fair than they; Perfect she seem'd in every limb and featureâ In short, she was a very noble creature. LXI The loosen'd tresses of her golden hair Down her white neck and heaving bosom stray'd, Which, for the summer heat, she had laid bare To catch the breeze that o'er its billows play'd, And fondly murmuring seem'd to nestle there; (That thought's a little hackney'd, I'm afraid, But I'm reserving all the strength I can to Dress out a fairy, for my second canto.) LXII The dame, meanwhile, with delicate skill was braiding Bright flowers in baskets at her elbow set, With female tact their rainbow colours shading Into a fresh and fragrant coronetâ In which all lovely forms and splendours fading, In meet array and natural order, met; While, gently peeping those bright links between, Smiled varied leaves of light and sober green. LXIII There shone the lily, pure as woman's mind; And fragrant violet, bashful as her eye; And with grave ivy was the rose combined, Like woman's grace with wisdom blushingly; And the proud hyacinth was there entwined With gilly-flowers and gentle rosemary; And its dark leaves green myrtle interwove With smiling heart's-ease, type of woman's love. LXIV And ever, as her glancing fingers wove That blushing garland, at the lady's feet A bright-eyed maiden warbled songs of love, Which, like an echo, did her lute repeat, In such wild sort as if the music strove With her sweet accents which should be most sweet; But the far song was in a foreign tongue Which on the monarch's ear its magic burthen flung. LXV âHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter;â in like manner, I suppose, A foreign strain must always be preferr'd To one whose language every hearer knows. It seem'd, however, that the sweet sounds stirr'd That lady's fancy, for her bosom rose With frequent throbs, and ever and anon In her wild passionate eyes a burning lustre shone. LXVI I own she was not of that mien which I Am apt to fall in love with, though her frame Was faultless, and her spirit fine and high; But then what Shelley calls a âvestal flameâ Deepen'd her cheek's rich crimson, and her eye Had more of wanton fire than maiden shame, What thought King Arthur?âLove had master'd him, For his pulse falter'd, and his sight grew dim. LXVII âThe enchantment works,â thought Merlin; âthis will do; I think the image on his soul is painted;â And then the mirror suddenly withdrew, At which the King changed colour, reel'd, and fainted. Cold water on his face the courtiers threw Till he revived, and vow'd that vision sainted (Whoe'er she was) he would adore for life, And she, and only she, should be his wife. LXVIII âSire,â quoth the wizard, âby that wondrous science Which raised this splendid vision, I discover The dame to be the daughter of King Ryence, Hight Guenever, now pining for a lover; So, if it please your Majesty, I'll fly hence To Dublin, where he reigns, and carry over My mirror, in the which I'll let her see A handsome likeness of your Majesty. LXIX âYour Majesty must give me, if you please, Full power to carry on the whole affair, In which I pledge myself to bring you ease, And satisfy your wishes to a hair. Before next Autumn, if you fail to seize In your impassion'd arms the willing fair, And the full tide of wedded raptures whirl in, My art's all nonsense, and my name's not Merlin.â LXX I hate all dry details, so I omit The courtship, which was formally and duly Managed by proxy, with all Merlin's wit; He set about it skilfully and coolly; So that the marriage deeds were fairly writ, Sign'd, seal'd, and witness'd, by the first of July; And then King Arthur, with great pomp and pride, Set out for Dublin to bring home his bride. LXXI I own I think, from all I've ever seen Of lovers and of love (and that's no little,) That if each bride were courted like a Queen, (That is, by proxy,) 'twould do every tittle As well, and save spectators much chagrin; Unless the happy pair could eat their victual, Talk and behave like other Christian folk, Whose necks are yet ungall'd by Cupid's yoke. LXXII I speak this feelingly; because sometimes, While busy on my last immortal poem, And thinking less of kisses than of rhymes, Two lovers bored me much (for which I owe 'em A grudge,) with cooings, which to me seem'd crimes, And little less to all who chanced to know 'em. However, as the match has turn'd out well, I won't reproach them with a syllable. LXXIII It was a lovely morning of July, When brave King Arthur, laughing and light-hearted, With a well-dress'd and gallant company, From his good palace in Carlisle departed; Behind him rode all England's chivalry, Drums beat, and trumpets bray'd, and horses started, And flowers were flung from window and balcony, And songs yell'd out in praise of matrimony. LXXIV Forth on the road to Holyhead they pass'd, A goodly partyâLords, and Knights, and Squires, Ladies, who killing looks around them cast, And Minstrels thrumming on their tuneless wires, All in their Sunday clothes, from first to last; Vintners, and cooks with faces like their fires, Monks, tailors, mountebanks, and such small deer, Jumbled like Chaucer's pilgrims, closed the rear. LXXV I won't relate the stories that were toldâ The catches that were sung, all through North Wales; Because the whole description, if not old, Would scarce surpass the Canterbury Tales. To cut the matter short, they soon behold The port of Holyhead, now white with sails, And the King's fleet at anchor near the land, With pennons flying, and the yards all mann'd. LXXVI The catalogue of shipsâthe embarkationâ The names of the commandersâand the frights Sustain'd by ladies, with the consolation Duly administer'd by courteous knightsâ The King's sea-sickness, and the sad cessation It caused in his contemplative delights, With other slight disasters which befell 'em, I leave to better bards, who've wit to tell 'em. LXXVII The morning rose in sunshine and in smiles, As the King's galley enter'd Dublin's bay, And joyous look'd the verdant gem of isles, To welcome, in due form, the nuptial day; The shore was throng'd with carriages for miles, And crowds had come on foot a monstrous way, To drink, in whisky-punch, to the alliance Of Arthur with the daughter of King Ryence. LXXVIII There are some points of contrast in the cases,â Some of resemblance,âfind them if you will; Of which the principal that I can trace is Thisâthat King Arthur sail'd, in hopes to fill With a young bride his heart and his embraces; King George the Fourth, you know, was luckier still; For his spouse left the world she'd long been troubling, Just as he anchor'd in the bay of Dublin. LXXIX The papers, which so loyally recorded King George's landing on the Irish coast, May serve for Arthur's, and are choicely worded, Especially the Times and Morning Post. And as no room just now can be afforded, I must refer my readers, all or most, Back to those honest chronicles, which tell In prose what verse could never paint so well. LXXX What were the feelings of the royal turtles, When each first saw what each had loved so longâ How they were crown'd with roses and with myrtles,â The Poet Laureate's hymeneal song,â The list of jewels, feathers, robes, and kirtles,â The steeples which peal'd forth their glad ding-dong,â The feast and frolics of the nuptial week,â Are things of which I shan't presume to speak. LXXXI It is enough to state that they were wedded, All due respect to ancient customs shown, And, (courtship's dangerous maze once safely threaded,) The lovers deem'd the world was now their own. Both seem'd, for weeks, light-hearted and light-headed; But when the honey-moon was fairly flown, They left King Ryence and the Emerald isle, And travell'd home in triumph to Carlisle. LXXXII What happen'd there, and how the match turn'd outâ The tournamentsâthe gauntlets that were flung For ladies' smiles, by gentle knights and stout, With much that happen'd those great folks among, If courteous readers like what I'm about, âMy future labours may not leave unsung;â Though neither Guenever's nor Arthur's glory, Will form henceforth the subject of my story. LXXXIII I've not, as yet, produced upon the stage My hero, nor my heroineâbut assure The ladies that the first will quite engage Their tender hearts,âa noble knight though poor; And for the second, if she's not the rage, (My gentle fairy, ma belle Tryamour) I shall be very sorry for the men, And won't encroach upon their time again. LXXXIV Half my next canto, I make free confession, (Was ever such a candid bard as I?) Unless relieved by excellent digression, May, very possibly, be rather dry; But when I quit the court, and gain possession Of fairy bowers and forest scenery, (Subjects so dear to Shakspere and to me) The reader then shall seeâwhat he shall see. LXXXV This canto's but the porch, as Wordsworth says, (See the Excursion) to a larger building; The body of the work I've yet to raise, And garnish the inside with paint and gilding: But when the whole's complete I'll win such praise As never yet a poet's bosom thrill'd in; Unless blue devils, or disasters worse, Should intervene to interrupt my verse. LXXXVI But these things are in embryo;âand now, Before I send my packet to the press, And to the reader make my parting bow, I'd have a gentle name my page to bless. Shall it be thine?âoh! no, Ione, thou Art yet a thought of too great holiness; And of a different strain the verse must be Which I can bear to dedicate to thee. LXXXVII If aught in happier vein, with worthy pride, Hereafter I achieve of gentle song, If fitting utterance be not still denied To visions which have held my soul so long That their deep sleep will not be cast aside, Thou art the cause, and unto thee belong The fruits of that late harvestâat thy feet, Sweet friend, they then shall lieâan offering wild, but meet. LXXXVIII I now despise myself, that I have spoken Thy name 'midst fancies of a lighter kind, And with wild words my soul's long silence broken: Nor should this be, Ione, could I find The hope to greet thee with a bolder tokenâ But fare thee well, until I shall have twined, (If that may be) with power that fails me now, A wreath which shall not shame thy peerless brow. LXXXIX Or to the Genii of far distant places, The dreams which linger yet by Severn's side?â Or to each spot which here remembrance traces,â The scenes of boyish pleasure, hope, and pride,â The sports still loved, the old familiar faces, The air whose inspiration hath not diedâ To all thine old enchantments, still so strong, Sweet Eton, shall I dedicate my song? XC Or shall my spirit, for a moment, hover, With wistful gaze, o'er Granta's tranquil bowers, As o'er some maiden's sleep her phantom lover; And to the memory of departed hours, And calm enjoyments, which, alas, are over, Suspend a votive wreath of fading flowers; Greeting the Unforgotten who remain In shades which I shall never see again? XCI Dear thoughts are these, which will not soon decay, But I'm beginning, I'm afraid, to whine; So, lest this canto should not close to-day, I'll not indite another serious line; But to thy image thus inscribe my lay, Unknown, but much respected âCaroline,â From whom I've just received a flattering letter, Which makes me inconceivably your debtor. XCII I know not, lady, if thy cheek be fair, Nor what may be the colour of thine eyes; I ask no questions about lips or hair, But I am sure that thou art good and wise And gentle, and hast kindly tears to spare, In graver moods, to poet's phantasies; And therefore, lady, shalt thou be enshrined Amidst the holiest visions of my mind. XCIII Haply I ne'er shall see thee:âbe it so; I have a gentle vision of my own,â A maiden with meek eyes, and locks that flow Down on her lustrous shoulders; all alone She sits, with saint-like aspectâtouch'd with woe; Muteâlistening to the low and dreamy tone Of quiet musings and calm thoughts, enshrined Deep in the inmost temple of her mind. XCIV Ay! there it is, with radiant garments flowing, Like summer clouds around the rising sunâ The soul-lit eye with heavenly rapture glowing, The cheek just crimson'd o'er, and leaning on The small and snowy handâalas! I'm growing Most eloquently crazyâbut I've done; I only mean to say the form's enshrined Amidst the holiest visions of my mind. XCV Perhaps 'tis better, lady, we should ne'er Meet, lest this picture should receive a taint; Though I believe that thou art far more fair Than aught that my poor phantasy can paint; But then you know, dear madam, if I were Proud to be thought a poet (which I an't) I should be fearful that those eyes so critical Might think my person not the most poetical. XCVI In the mean time I'll thank you to believe me The beau ideal of a poet's figure; Your kind imagination may conceive me Like Milton on the whole, though something bigger: Slender and graceful;âyet I own 'twould grieve me Not to possess my share of youthful vigourâ Paint how you pleaseâI leave it to your taste, In which my fullest confidence is placed. XCVII And here I pause awhile, and wish good bye To all my readers; hoping they've perused These sorry stanzas with indulgent eye, And won't disdain to own they've been amused; In which case, by the first of next July, I shall be very glad to be abused By churlish criticsâso but hearts most wise Deign to approve my rambling phantasies. INTRODUCTORY STANZAS TO THE SECOND CANTO OF SIR LAUNFAL. TO ? 1 Beneath these willow-boughs, whose hovering shade Shifts with the breeze o'er this secluded stream, 'Midst reeds and waving bulrushes embay'd, My boat hath floated since the noon-day gleam; And now the light of eve begins to fade, And I am scarce awaken'd from my dreamâ My long day-dream of thee.âO! gentle friend, When will this thraldom of my spirit end? 2 The storm, by which my heart so late was shaken, Is over, and my thoughts are tranquil now, And I can bear to feel myself forsakenâ Yea, with a placid and unalter'd brow; Though, ever and anon, doth Memory waken The slumbering gusts which make my spirit bow And reel to its foundationsâstill my sleep Is throng'd with passionate dreams, from which I start to weep. 3 And though these lovely haunts have never seen Thy beautyânor, perchance, shall ever see, Yet here the shadow of thy charms hath been, And here are fresh remembrances of thee. This lonely creekâthese islands wild and greenâ These woods and hills, speak feelingly to me; For here that wild and secret passion grew, In the first solitude my heart e'er knew. 4 But I must dream no more:âand if I borrow From the cold world one last and pensive day To bury my dead hopes and soothe fond sorrow With the last tears these eyes will ever pay To passionâthou wilt pardon me. To-morrow Breaks the last spell, and bears me far away From this dream-haunted region;âhere I part With the last folly of my hardening heart. 5 So now farewell to Love,âbut not to thee, High-hearted Friend!âThe hour of my despair Did first reveal thy being's depths to me; I saw the beauty of thy soul laid bare,â Its power, and gentleness, and majesty, Its deep and strong affections; and I swear, Here, while my hopes lie crush'd and bleeding yet, Thou art the noblest spirit I have met. 6 High converse, since that hour, we two have held, Which will not be forgotten; thou alone Hast search'd my inmost bosom, and beheld My nature in its weakness;âthou hast known The thoughts that shook, the passions that rebell'd, The dreams that made me tremble;âlike thine own, Have been my spirit's faintings.âO! that thou Couldst feel the fulness of my triumph now! 7 Methinks I could embrace my desolation, And say âFarewellâ serenely, were I sure That thy young spring of joyous expectation From that far gathering tempest were secure, Which yet may shake thy peace to its foundationâ But I believe that thou wilt well endure The fury of the storm, and lift thy brow To heaven, unscathed, and more serene than now. 8 For in thy thoughtful forehead's clear expanse, And in the lightning of thy quick, wild eye, And in the restless dreams, that shift and glance Through all thy eloquent looks incessantlyâ In each bright movement of thy countenanceâ In thy most thrilling converseâI descry Heaven's stamp; nor e'er shall human error bind The strength and genius of thy mighty mind. 9 O! had I known thee earlierâbut one yearâ One little yearâwhen thou wast fancy-free,â While both our natures trembled with one fear, And panted with one thirstâI vow to thee, By all that to my soul on earth is dear, By all thy hopes of final victory, By all we feel within, around, aboveâ Thou shouldst have loved me with a Spirit's love. 10 Nor vain had been my hope that I had found In thee the embodied phantasy, whose gleams Kindled my sleep for years, and pour'd around My path the brightness of a poet's dreamsâ Whose voice was to my ear a phantom-sound, So sweet, that its ideal music seems E'en now to haunt my senseâthat thou wert She To whom my dearest hopes must cling eternally. 11 'Tis o'erâbut there are words, which thou hast spoken, Writ on my heart in fireâand now I know The slumber of my soul at length is broken, Yea, by the stroke that laid its visions low; Perchance hereafter I may find a token Worthy to speak to thee of all I owe, But never can repay theeâbut e'en now I must fulfil one unforgotten vow. 12 Have I not said that from this alter'd lyre The strains thou lov'st not shall be heard no more? Have I not said my spirit shall aspire (If yet its weaken'd wing hath power to soar) To nobler darings with a pure desire? That when this tale is toldâthese wanderings o'er, My song shall be attuned, with high endeavour, To loftier musicâor be mute for ever? 13 Haply, asleep in Reason's secret cells, A power is hid, which yet may make me strong; Haply, the desert of my soul hath wells Which yet may pour a deeper stream of song; Haplyâbut oh! awaken'd conscience tells That I have trifled with my heart too longâ Deaden'd each nobler impulse, and profaned The strength which Nature for high toils ordain'd. 14 Yet, from this hour, will I, with earnest thought, Heap knowledge from neglected mines of lore; âAnd from that hour did I, with earnest thought, Heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore. Shelley. If, haply, by long process, may be wrought To steadfast ends my mind's unfashion'd ore: Nor vain shall be the lessons thou hast taught, Nor vain that purpose which, for thee, I swore I would pursue in silence.âBut 'tis time To end this idle and presumptuous rhyme. 15 The task, which I began in happier hours, Lies yet a shapeless fragmentâand 'twill be Hard to renew, with worn and drooping powers, That toil whose fruits will yield no joy to thee. Yetâfor the feelings that so late were oursâ Thou wilt forgive my foolish phantasy, Dallying with bitter jests, as if to ease The aching of unheal'd remembrances. 16 Perhaps amidst my laughter, thou wilt hear, At times, a sadder and more solemn tone, Recalling to thine unforgetful ear Things which are yet reveal'd to thee alone; And thou, I think, wilt hold those accents dear, And greet them with a pleasure all thine own; Nor shall these gifts, which I so coldly bring, Seem in thy sight a worthless offering. CANTO II. I Four months are past, since I've put pen to paper; Four months of mingled sun, and wind, and rain, Fog, thunder, morning frost, and evening vapour; These soaking summers That of 1823. spoil one's rhyming vein; But now I'll mend my pen, and trim my taper, And sit down steadily to work again; Because the public will be glad, I'm sure, To hear at last some news of Tryamour. II We left King Arthur and his lovely bride Safe at Carlisleâthe honey-moon was over, The happy pair had now grown sober-eyed, Yet still, for several months, they lived in clover; She seem'd a guardian-angel at his side, And he was less a husband than a lover; So one year pass'd, but ere a third had shone, Loveâvirtueâcomfortâconfidence were gone. III But here, at starting, I must just premise (Lest any reader should look grave and cold) That 'tis not my intention to disguise A tale immoral in decorous mould. Approach not me, ye cockneys, good and wise, And other great philosophers, who hold That Epicurus is Man's best physician, And chastity a âmonkish superstition.â Shelleyânotes to Queen Mab. IV Think not to gain, in me, a new recruitâ You'll find yourselves mistaken, I assure you; I hate your doctrines, and your rhymes to boot, And tell you, in plain terms, I can't endure you; I'd thresh you soundly, if I'd time to do't, And thought a canto's horse-whipping would cure you,â Though, I confess, 'twould grieve me to affront That cleverest coxcomb in the world, Leigh Hunt. V I'll spare thy weaker brethren for thy sakeâ I love thee, when I laugh at thee, sweet Leigh; But do, my gentle Indicator, take A friend's advice, and soon recross the sea. How canst thou tarry with the jaded rake, The heartless bard, the hoary debauchee, The impotent reviler, who's unfurl'd His Atheist banner to reform the world? VI With all thy follies, thou wast still sincere, And gentle (save in politics) though blind, And very often silly, and, I fear, Hast done some harm among the cockney kind; But what in that same misanthropic peer, What, in the name of wonder, couldst thou find, Which could induce thee to suppose that he Would make a good enthusiast, simple Leigh? VII Thou wast a faithful and a fit Achates, Once, to a great Ãneas, Percy Shelleyâ A vast, though erring spirit, whose sad fate is A thing which I deploreâbut let me tell ye, You made yourself a monstrous ninny gratis With that same funeral pileâhe might as well lie Methinks, beneath the turf o'ergrown with flowers, As dance among the winds and thunder-showers. VIII However, he and you of course knew best; His life, at least, was suited to his end,â His obsequies to bothâso let them rest; But how Achates could at once descend From his to Byron's friendship, I protest, Is what it puzzles me to comprehend; Take care, sweet Leigh, or you'll afford the Tories A handle to invent ill-natured stories. IX They'll sayâI shan't believe 'emâbut they'll say That Leigh's become what once he most abhorr'd; Has thrown his independence all away, And dubb'd himself toad-eater to a Lord; And though, of course, you'll hit as hard as they, I fear you'll find it difficult to ward Their poison'd arrows offâyou'd best come back, Before the Cockney kingdom goes to wrack. X The Examiner's grown dull as well as dirty, The Indicator's sick, the Liberal dead;â I hear its readers were some six-and-thirty, But really 'twas too stupid to be read. 'Tis plain your present partnership has hurt ye: Poor brother John âlooks up and is not fed;â For scarce a soul will purchase or get through one E'en of his shilling budgets of Don Juan. XI Poor brother John!âpoor Cockneys!âbut I've spent More time upon you now than you deserve, Because your King for better things was meant, And shows, on most occasions, pluck and nerve; I hope, sincerely, he may yet repent; For you, sweet Cockneys, these few hints must serveâ Perhaps I may expand them, by and by, But have, at present, other fish to fry. XII Buz on poor drones, too stingless to be fear'd, Obscurity and dullness will protect you all; I only wish your notions ne'er had sear'd Far nobler hearts and heads more intellectual,â Some whom to me deep feelings have endear'd,â Whomâbut regret's absurd and ineffectual; Oh! that such souls should quit their flights divine, To herd with Epicurus and his swine! XIII I hope I don't offend;âbut oh! sweet Fortune, If thou hast eyes where I may favour find, Or ears to hear my prayersâgrant now this short one; Oh! bore me with the dullest of mankindâ With fools most grave, and puppies most importune, With talkative old women deaf and blind; Kill me with pedants, dandies, dolts, and oafs, But saveâoh! save me from all philosophes. XIV They'll say I'm foolishâprejudicedâabsurdâ Unphilosophicalâthe slave of custom; And I acknowledge that I've still preferr'd The old worn pathsâfor I can safely trust 'em; To love one's country, and to keep one's word, Are good old maxims, nor will time e'er rust 'emâ Our modern creeds are wiser, I dare say, But sometimes lead us wofully astray. XV 'Tis hard, to find the souls long used to blend With yours, infected by Hell's deadly leaven; 'Tis hard, to find your âown familiar friend,â The foe of all your hopes in Earth and Heaven; 'Tis hardâbut hush! these thoughts must not be penn'dâ Kind reader, let my folly be forgivenâ 'Tis overâand we'll now trangress no farther, But travel back to Britain and King Arthur. XVI It was a merry time in Old Carlisle; The royal pair had closed their wedding tour, And all the first and fairest of the isle, Knight, squire, and lady, page and paramour, Came to do homage there in proper style, And feast, for several months, both rich and poor; You may conceive the bustle and the row, Which I've no time to paint minutely now. XVII The entertainments were of different kinds, Adapted to each colour and capacity Both of patrician and plebeian mindsâ Balls, masks, and plays for tempers of vivacity, Bear-baits and singlestick for boors and hinds, And feasts for every species of edacity, With butts of ale and hogsheads of metheglin, And sportive songs to set the ladies giggling. XVIII I wish I could depict, in colours glowing, The knights who figured in King Arthur's train; Sir Persevall, Sir Tristram, and Sir Gawain, Sir Eglamour, Sir Guy, Sir Agrafayn, Sir Launcelot of the Lake, Sir Kay, Sir Owen, Sir Hugh, Sir Lanvalâeach of whom I'd fain Immortalize in numbers ne'er surpast, But must restrict that honour to the last. XXIX Sir Lanval, or Sir Lonvalâwhich you please, (Sir Launfal, I believe, 's the genuine reading) Except Sir Launcelot, was by some degrees, The noblest knight alive for grace and breeding; A finer face than his one seldom sees; A nobler form hath seldom ta'en the lead in Battle or ball; a heart more deep and free Ne'er graced the good old days of chivalry. XX His birth was princely, and his fortune largeâ At least, had been so, for his liberality Was boundless, shrinking from no cost or charge; In fact, profusion seem'd his leading quality; Had he been âheir of Calydon and Arge,â His coffers would have dwindled to a nullity, Beneath the constant round of princely presents, He lavish'd daily upon slaves and peasants. XXI Silver, and gold, and garments rich and rare, He sent, with courteous words, to squire and knight;â Jewels and gauds to ladies brown and fair,â Gave tournaments by day and balls at night, With dinners fit to surfeit a Lord Mayor; In short, so bounteous was this worthy knight, That Arthur, with his princely conduct smitten, Had made him Lord High Steward of Great Britain. XXII Sir Launfal bore his blushing honours well, Without the smallest pride or ostentation, So that he never for a moment fell In popular regard and estimation; Still was he courteous, kind, and affable, Behaving as became his rank and station,â His manners never alter'd for the worse, His heart was not less open,ânor his purse. XXIII For full twelve months Sir Launfal's presence graced King Arthur's court, although 'twas clearly seen Its morals were ill suited to his taste, And he was sorely hated by the queen, Whose favourites people thought were rarely chaste, While you might read in good Sir Launfal's mien, That he (although his virtue made no fuss) Was most unfashionably virtuous. XXIV The festival had now attain'd its height; Carlisle was throng'd with fashion; every day The court was treated with some new delight; And, ere the sports were done, old authors say Queen Guenever bestow'd on every knight Some token of her love to bear away; Sir Launcelot had a ring, Sir Guy a jewel, Sir Launfal nothing, which he thought was cruel. XXV He could not brook this palpable neglectâ He thought the queen had shown a want of taste; And, as his fortune now was nearly wreck'd By his long habits of expense and waste, He told his majesty, with due respect, That âhe was forced to leave the court in haste;â He wish'd he could have seen the approaching tourney, But couldn't for a day defer his journey. XXVI âHis father now in years, his letters told him, Was sick and like to die, and wish'd once more, Before his grave was ready, to behold him; In fact, his horse was saddled at the door, And he, unless his monarch's will controll'd him, Quite ready to depart.â The King was sore At heart to lose him, but gave free permission, Entreating him to use all expedition. XXVII So forth Sir Launfal rode one autumn morning, With a light pocket and a heavy heart; Hopeless and nearly pennyless, but scorning To play at court a base dependent's part, And thinking, since, in spite of every warning, He'd wasted thus his wealth, he'd bear the smart In silence, as became him, without troubling His friends in London, Aberdeen, or Dublin. XXVIII There's something in a solitary ride Most cheering to one's spiritsâthough I own 'Tis better with a lady at one's side, Pretty and wittyâbut when left alone And hippish, I advise you to bestride Your favourite chesnut, sorrel, bay, or roan, And o'er the nearest common take a canter As if you were pursued like Tam o'Shanter. XXIX But, gentle lover, if 'tis love indeed, And not the fall of stocks, or rise of beef, Which gives you the blue-devils, pray take heed How you walk out alone, or seek relief In lonely vale or daisy-dappled meadâ You'll find new objects there to feed your grief; In each green grove, by every purling stream, You'll be for lying down, to weep and dream. XXX You'll stop and gather cowslipsâyou'll sit down, And pick them all to piecesâthen you'll sigh For their untimely fateâso like your ownâ And then your tears will gush from either eye, As if yourself, as well as woes, they'd drownâ And then will sad and sleepless memory Summon a host of absent looks and tones, Enough to break the heart of stocks and stones. XXXI No, no, touch not the earth, but mount and scurry O'er hill and dale, o'er rugged ground and even; Leap turnpike-gatesâswim rivers in your hurry; Shoot, like a whirlwind, between earth and heaven,â And thus, amidst the fever and the flurry, In which your senses all are toss'd and driven, Sunshine above, and thy good steed beneath thee, Thou may'st contrive to drain a draught of Lethe. XXXII I say this from experience, and address it To lovers without hope, and under age, Whose flame's at best a bright but wavering cresset, A heartburn which prompt medicines may assuage. My skill's not universal, (I confess it,) I can't prescribe for fools more grave and sage;â Love at sixteen, and love at twenty-three Differ no less in nature than degree. XXXIII Love at sixteen's a sort of mental measlesâ A thing you must have once, but soon get over; Not grave and steady, like Sir Peter Teazle's, But fierce and soon burnt out;âyour school-boy lover Eats, drinks, and sleeps on love, but little sees else Than dim and shapeless dreams which round him hover; He seldom dreams of marriage, (the fond elf,) At least if I may judge him from myself: XXXIV Or if he does, 'tis as bards dream of turtle, A dream of other worlds, remote, idealâ A vision of green dells, and groves of myrtle, And lonely cots, where two fond hearts must be all In all to one anotherâ'twould subvert all His air-built fabric, should you make it real By introducing marriage-deeds, and rings, And parsons, and such gross material things. XXXV And yet his passion is sincere and fervent, And blind of course, (that's not his case aloneâ 'Tis true, for instance, of myself and Derwent, Whose years are riper, and whose hearts full-grown:) Six weeks he lives the fair one's humblest servant, Sees all her faults as clearly as his own, Lives on her smiles till he returns to school, And then a fortnight makes his passion cool. XXXVI Now love at twenty-three 's a graver madness, For at those years the heart hath ceased to dream; You're wide awake, in calm and sober sadness, Where all things are as real as they seem; And if young hope should turn your sighs to gladness, E'en in your spring of bliss, 'tis still a theme For grave considerations, hopes and fears, And cool provision for the after years. XXXVII And Reason wakes, and Love's no longer blind, And Hymen his true face doth now discover; And you must look into the fair one's mind, And fathom well her heart before you love her; But when the heart and head are once combined, And Reason sanctions Passionâit's all overâ You're dish'dâand if she's cruel, (this bright she)â Alas! poor gentleman of twenty-three! XXXVIII For you're too young to bear your fate discreetly And coolly, as you ought; and you're too old To rend and break your twisted chains completely, Cast your crush'd passion in some other mould, And, with new hopes, at more propitious feet lieâ Alas! when that fit's o'er, your heart grows cold, And if you ever wed, you wed for moneyâ Which is the usual end of matrimony. XXXIX Not being in love, Sir Launfal travell'd solwly; He had no sad remembrances to shun; It was the future which perplex'd him solely,â The thought of what was fittest to be doneâ Which made his pace more grave and melancholy; And thus he journey'd, till the setting sun Forewarn'd him of the near approach of night, And he began to feel an appetite. XL The dew rose dankly as the sun went down, And the autumnal breeze grew damp and chill, While poor Sir Launfal, and his courser brown, Were unprovided with a lodging still; At last, as evening fell, his native town Lay right before his eyes, and made them fill With memory's sweetest tears. Ten years had pass'd Since he beheld that much-loved steeple last. XLI And up rose many a dormant recollection In the most lone recesses of his mind, And many a dream gone by and crush'd affection Came o'er him; but Sir Launfal had not dined, And was too hungry for profound reflection; Besides, his horse had feelings less refined, And gave strong symptoms of a disposition To sink from sheer fatigue and inanition. XLII So on they fared, (Sir Launfal and his horse,) And through the twilight city took their way; The former thinking of old times, of course, The latter wrapt in dreams of oats and hay; How hunger freezes feeling at its source! Poor courser! after fasting a whole day, With what emotions dost thou now behold The very stable where thy dam was foal'd? XLIII Say, know'st thou not yon green and stagnant pool? 'Twas there that thou didst quench thy youngling thirst, When first maternal tenderness grew cool; In yonder paddock wast thou halter'd first,â There thy first hay was munch'd, poor hairy fool, Is not thy soft heart swelling fit to burst? Alas! I might as well address thy crupperâ Thou think'st of nothing but thy stall and supper. XLIV As through the market-place Sir Launfal rode, The gossips all came out to peep and stare; And many a young cheek at his aspect glow'd,â And many an unforgotten face was there! At last the charger, with his handsome load, Stopp'd right before the mansion of the Mayor;â He was the old Sir Launfal's groom of yore, Which made the wise steed fix upon his door. XLV And forth he came (this corpulent old man) In a prodigious hurry, and knelt down And kiss'd Sir Launfal's stirrup, and began In good set terms to welcome him to town, âWhich was unworthyâ (thus the oration ran) âTo entertain a knight of such renownâ But bonfires should be lit, and bells should ringâ And pray how fared his Sovereign Lord the King?â XLVI More had he spoken, but the knight cut short His courteous greeting with, âMy good Lord Mayor, His Majesty was well when I left courtâ And that he long may be so is my prayer; Though I no more his favour and his sport (Such is my wayward destiny) must share; Nor rain on thee and thine, with liberal hand, The honours and the fatness of the land. XLVII âMy race is run; henceforth let men no more Love poor Sir Launfal for his Sovereign's sake; The splendour of my life is past and o'er, My dreams dispersed, my senses wide awake; I've kept my virtue, but I've spent my store; And now my solitary way I take, Here, in my native town, to mend my ways, And waste the frugal remnant of my days. XLVIII âHere, my old faithful servant, in thy house Fain would I, for a while, find rest and ease.ââ The Mayor (a man remarkable for nouse), During Sir Launfal's speech had, by degrees, Much changed his mind, and silent as a mouse, First let the stirrup drop, then from his knees Recovering, stood before his patron's eyes, The gaping picture of chagrin'd surprise. XLIX Three times his faltering lips essay'd to speak; Three times the imperfect sounds were lost in air; Three times he clear'd his throat, and seem'd to seek Words to express the depth of his despair: At last they cameââSir Knight, for the last week, Seven of your order I've expected there; My house is all bespokeâyou're come too lateâ Good lack! 'tis really most unfortunate.â L âHad you but sent to let me know, or written, I Would have procured you lodgingsâat least triedâ If not put off these knights from little Britany; But now each house is taken far and wideâ Yet stopââ (he scratch'd his head) âthis plan I've hit on, I Have a small cottage by my orchard side, Where if with moderate room you'll be content, You can resideâI sha'n't charge much for rent. LI âThe house, though small, is dryâthe situation Extremely pleasant, healthy, light and airy; And, if you're fond of cows, for recreation Your honour may, at will, look through my dairy, Which forms the chief delight and occupation Of Blanch, my daughter, whom men call âthe Fairy,â Whomâbut, profoundly as I dote upon her, I know that I may trust Sir Launfal's honour.â LII Sir Launfal's cheek grew red,âhis eyes shot fire, He felt inclined to spurn the ungrateful proffer; But soon, on cooler thoughts, he check'd his ire, Feeling that nothing else so fit might offer As this lone cottage of his quondam squire, To one who'd nearly wasted his last coffer; And so, to cut a tedious story shortâ Sir Launfal hired the placeâand paid him for't. LIII Sir Launfal, when a boy, had learnt to read, And (what was still more wonderful) to write; And his old studies, in his time of need, Prove now a source of comfort and delight. He grew a most amazing clerk indeed, Was very often at his books all night; He then turn'd author, wrote some sheets of rhymes, And âMemoirs of King Arthur's Court and Times.â LIV The country people took him for a wizardâ It seem'd they all misconstrued the word âspell;â In those days not a soul knew A from Izzard, As now we all do, thanks to Doctor Bell; So this book-learning stuck in every gizzard, And if they met him after evening fell, Poor wretches, how they quaked!âthough all conceded That no hobgoblin could behave as he did. LV When the spring came, Sir Launfal took to fishing, And, though he never fish'd without his book, Contrived sometimes to bring a handsome dish in, Which little Blanch with ready smiles would cook, For she presided o'er Sir Launfal's kitchen; Poor little Blanch; beware how thou dost look On that fine face, or thine will soon be pale, And I shall have to tell a piteous tale. LVI She was a young and most enchanting creature, This âFairyâ Blanch, then scarcely turn'd sixteen; As some one sings âwith gay and delicate feature,â And her heart flashing through her guileless mien; For Nature still had been her only teacher, And taught her nought but happinessâI've seen But one face, that I know of, to compare With her's for radiant smiles, and few so fair. LVII The face that I allude toâbut I'll not Digress when I can help itâI'll but say, En passant, that it ne'er can be forgot, While my soul lingers in its home of clay; And, whatsoe'er may be its owner's lot, Her goodness, which I never can repay, Among my holiest thoughts shall still be shrined, Yea, near Ione, in my inmost mind. LVIII But to my task. This happy creature's song Each morning, in his dreams, Sir Launfal heard, Beneath his lattice as she tripp'd along,â Sweet as the hymn of morn's full-hearted bird, And no less joyous;âfor she thought no wrong, Nor ever had the breeze of passion stirr'd Her heart's clear watersâso her voice was free In its full gush of natural melody. LIX And through her garden, with the morn's first light, With fawn-like footsteps would the maiden roam, To pluck fresh garlands for the stranger knight, Which in her lap she laughingly brought home, And flung them o'er him with a girl's delight, If by such playful wiles she might o'ercome His melancholy mood;âthe good knight smiledâ And gladden'd with kind looks that loveliest child. LX Even as a father or some tender friend, To her at times full gently would he speak, Smooth her fair clustering locks, and mildly bend To kiss her ivory forehead or soft cheek, For greeting or good night.âI don't pretend To know how he contrived, for many a week, To keep his heart untouch'dâAlas! poor Blanch, Thy gentle bosom was not half so stanch. LXI Poor bird! thou art infectedâ'tis too late To fly; Love's net has tangled thy sweet wings. Alas! 'tis vain to struggle with thy fate; Thou hast beheld thy last of happy springs. Sweet Blanch, too surely art thou desolateâ Oh! for some finer hand to touch my strings! Oh! for the strains of him who sung so well Of slain Lorenzo and his Isabel! Keats. LXII But for sweet BlanchâSir Launfal's tone and look Unwittingly had pierced her artless breast; And soon their wonted bloom her cheeks forsook, And her pale eye-lids were deprived of rest; Beneath his glance her gentle spirit shook With love, though scarcely to herself confest; And still his absent voice was in her ears, And her lone pillow still was bathed in tears. LXIII Poor little girl! alas, she had no sister To whom her secret grief she might reveal, No mother, whose mild counsel might assist herâ Her pangs in secret was she doom'd to feel; And now Sir Launfal's looks, whene'er he kiss'd her, (Which was but seldom) pierced her heart like steel, They were so coldâfor he was not so stupid As to o'erlook this handy-work of Cupid. LXIV Therefore from dangerous talk did he refrain, And hid the tears which to his eyes would start For pity of the love-sick maiden's pain; For good Sir Launfal had a tender heart; Though, as I said before, and say again, I can't imagine where he found the art To keep it as he didâunless some spell Lay on his natureâwhich seems probable. LXV O Reader! was it e'er thy sad mischance To be beloved, when thou no more wast freeâ To shrink and quail at Beauty's brightest glance, Because 'twas brightest when it beam'd on theeâ To check each kinder look, each meek advance Of timorous love, with coldest courtesyâ Yet feel how deep that barbed coldness went? And she so youthful and so innocent; LXVI If such should ever be thy hapless lot, I charge thee from her presence quickly fly; Begone, while yet there's time, and linger not To feed the passion of her ear and eye: Haply, when absent, thou shalt be forgot; But if to glut thy heartless vanity, Thou triflest with her happinessâI vow, There's not on earth a wretch more curs'd than thou. LXVII 'Tis hard, no doubt, to say farewell for ever, To one who loves you, though you love not her,â 'Tis hard your wandering eyes from her's to sever; But curb your inclinations, or you'll err. The following couplet is profound and clever, (Your Poet's still the best Philosopher) ??? ?? ??????? ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????????? ????? ??? ????????. LXVIII These lines are taken out of Sophocles, Ajax, 1085-6. Be not alarm'd, fair ladies; all that's meant Is, that if once you do whate'er you please, You're sure to have good reason to repent. I think it right to state such facts as these, For fear some honest Grecian should invent A meaning for the lines that's false or strain'd, When ladies come to have the Greek explain'd. LXIX But to proceed. When Blanch's father knew The love his daughter to Sir Launfal bore, (Though sore her strife to hide from outward view The wound that rankled at her young heart's core) Pale, on a sudden, and enraged he grew, And angrily he bade her seek no more The orchard cottage, and in secret curst Sir Launfal and the hour he came there first. LXX So, the poor maiden, to her thoughts confined, And to the grief that on her heart did press, In a perpetual sadness droop'd and pined, Wasting in tears her youthful loveliness; Stricken she seem'd in body and in mind, And those who look'd into her eyes might guess Her days on earth were number'd;âthus she waned To death, yet never, save with tears, complain'd. LXXI And every day her wasted cheek grew paler, And dimmer, every day, her eye became; And the sweet music of her voice did fail her, And her light footstep was no more the same. The neighbours deem'd no natural grief could ail her, And swore Sir Launfal had bewitch'd her frame; 'Twas true Sir Launfal had bewitch'd her,ânot Her body, but her soul,âwhich they forgot. LXXII As for Sir Launfal, he was glad to see That she return'd no moreâhe felt 'twas wise; Though he oft miss'd her gentle company, And now would sometimes think of her with sighs, Recalling to his wakeful memory Her voice so touching and her love-sick eyes; And yet Sir Launfal still was fancy-free, Which really is most wonderful to me! LXXIII Meanwhile, Sir Launfal's purse began to dwindle To very small dimensions; yet, the more It shrank, the more his heart appear'd to kindle With pity for each beggar at his door; The Fates for him had turn'd their darkest spindle; He gave, and gave, until his scanty store Was spent, and he was fairly in distress, Without a sixpence,âlone and comfortless. LXXIV The country-people, when his bounties ceas'd To flow as they were wont, and they could hope No longer at his cost to drink and feast, Gave to their fancies and their tongues full scope; 'Twas said, that all his demons were released By a new bull just issued by the Pope; And next, 'twas clearly proved, beyond denial, Others were come to take him off to trial. LXXV 'Twas thought a shame that he'd been thus permitted To deal, as he'd long dealt, in charms and spells, By which so many tradesmen he'd outwitted,â Enough to doom him to ten thousand hells; Then poor Miss Blanch was sadly to be pitied; You know she was the pink of country belles, Till he bewitch'd her with his hateful magic; 'Twas fear'd her end would be extremely tragic. LXXVI The rumour of Sir Launfal's ruin spread, Like wildfire, through the town, and young and old Supp'd upon scandal till they surfeited; But when to Blanch the heavy news was told By some kind gossip, she uprais'd her head, As if despair, at length, had made her bold; She felt that sorrow must kill her,âbut He, Oh! must he die for very poverty? LXXVII And she, as she well knew, had gold, and land, And flocks and herds, and jewels rich and gay, (Her mother's legacy,) which, with her hand, Should be bestow'd upon her wedding-day. But sheâas any fool might understandâ To Death in marriage now was given away; So why should not her store relieve the dearth Of the one creature whom she loved on earth? LXXVIII 'Twas the heart's logic:âbut the point, alas! Was her stern father of the gold to rid, Who kept it closely, and was no such ass As to yield up, or tell her where 'twas hid. At last, one day when he was gone to mass, Love lent her instinct, and she found the lid Which cover'd all her treasures, and her eye Gleam'd, as she seized the gold triumphantly. LXXIX Forgive her, reader; love's a bad logician, But mostly honest; and if now the tie Of duty she broke through, her lone condition Must be poor Blanch's sad apology; True, she forgot parental admonition, In seizing thus her ownâbut who'll deny That when young Love rebels, papa may go (As the song says) and preach at Jericho. LXXX This chanced one morn of merry Whitsuntide, When the whole city and its Corporation, Sheriffs, and Mayor, and Aldermen beside, Were in a state of festal preparation; And company pour'd in from far and wide, Of every age and sex, and rank and station, To the grand banquet held in the Town-hall, Which was to be succeeded by a ball. LXXXI The noblest knight that ever couch'd a lance Graced not that banquetâfor his wealth was gone; The loveliest maid that e'er adorn'd a dance Grac'd not that banquetâfor her cheek was wan; The former was reduced to trust to chance For turnips or a crust to dine upon; The latter was, just then, upon her way Her whole possessions at his feet to lay. LXXXII Indulgent reader, we'll omit the meeting, Because I couldn't paint it, if I would; You must conceive Sir Launfal's courteous greeting, His mild refusal, and his gratitudeâ The pale-faced girl her earnest suit repeatingâ His tears dried often and again renew'dâ This, and much more, kind reader, understand, Because this Canto's longer than I'd plann'd. LXXXIII Meekly she gazeth on his faded cheekâ His cheek with hunger pale, as her's with love; And with sad speech and piteous tears doth seek The stubborn purpose of his heart to move; Alas! she finds her best persuasion weak With his unyielding spiritâso she strove No longer of that boon to be a winner, But only ask'd him if he'd come to dinner. LXXXIV âAlas! thy cheek is thin and pale with want, Famine stares wildly through thy keen wan eye, And thou art lean, and spectre-like, and gaunt, Who wast bred up in tenderest luxury; Thou, of whom Britain did so lately vaunt, The gentlest knight of all her chivalry; Thou, still the first in battle and at boardâ The bravest champion and the noblest lord. LXXXV âI am unworthy that a prince like thee Should in my father's house such shelter find; Yet, gentle knight, do me this courtesy Once, ere I die, (for thou wast ever kind, And still hast been the noblest friend to me) Andâwhen we part, leave but one kiss behind, Such as thou gav'st of yore,âwhich I will keep For everâtill these eyes have ceased to weep.â LXXXVI Thus, the poor girl, with meek submissive eyes And earnest supplication, wept and knelt, Till in Sir Launfal did such ruth arise, As half enforced his spell-bound heart to meltâ But the charm held himâso, in courteous guise, Once more did he dissemble what he felt, And, in mild phrase, declined her gentle profferâ But thank'd her, very kindly, for the offer. LXXXVII Yet, lest his words should add one sorrow more To that sad bosom's pain, did he request âThat she would lend him from her father's store, A saddle and a bridle of the best;â (His own were seized for debt some time before) âWith which he would set out upon his quest Of great adventures, and redeem by strife His ruin'd fortunes, or else lose his life.â LXXXVIII They came: but, ere that mournful knight departed, The maiden's lips once gently did he press, Striving in vain to stem the tears which started At the sad prospect of her loneliness; He saw the girl for him was broken-hearted, And why he loved her not, he could not guess; But was prevented, by some charm or other, From feeling more than as a friend or brother. LXXXIX So he departed;âand, when next he came To that old town, the gentle girl was dead; Love was too mighty for her tender frame, Which sunk beneath his shaftsâand yet, 'tis said, She ne'er was heard to breathe Sir Launfal's name Till just before her guiltless spirit fled; And then, she bless'd him with her parting breath, And said she died for him, and welcomed death. XC Sir Launfal visited her grave, and wept Above it a long gush of silent tears;â And, in his noon of fortune, when he slept On an immortal breast, in after years, Still in his heart her lovely image kept, A thought distinct from earthly hopes and fears, But mix'd with yearnings for some after-home, And cherish'd hopes of endless bliss to come. XCI Amen! this Canto's no more like the last Than copper's like pure gold, or crockery delf;â I shan't be angry, reader, if it's cast Behind the fire, or left upon the shelf;â But by the next it shall be far surpast, (At least in what depends upon myself;)â In fact, the present Canto's whole demerit's Occasioned by my utter want of spirits. XCII Two more are yet to come; and then I quit The octave rhymeâperhaps the Museâfor ever; So I must try, in these to shew my wit, And make my final exit grand and clever;â I hope that Canto III. may prove a hit, Nor shall it fail for want of due endeavour;â Meanwhile I furl my sails and drop my oar, To soothe tired fancy with a stroll on shore. CANTO III. I Are you a poet, reader?âif you are, And under twenty, be advised by me;â Give up the trade in timeâyou'd better far Endure disgrace, chains, exile, poverty,â You'd better die at once, than live to mar This world's best hopes, in thankless slavery Grinding your soul, that, ere your bones are rotten, You may be mock'd, belied, reviled, forgotten. II Why I give this advice is not the question; Perhaps I've private reasonsânever mind; I charge you nothing for my bare suggestion, And though my words are coarse, my meaning's kind;â Perhaps I'm rather hipp'd from indigestion, Which proves, at least, that (though a bard) I've dinedâ But to returnâdo any thing you will But dream of reaching the Castalian rill. III That is, unless you've blood, and wind, and mettle, And constant training, and five feeds a dayâ âBooks, leisure, perfect freedom,â and can settle, In rhyme as a profession:âI dare say, On terms like these, a bard of proper metal May snap his fingers at the dense array Of stupid heads, cold hearts, and adverse fortune, Which mostly make the poet's life a short one. IV Goâif you can, for poesy's sweet sake Renounce all social comforts;âlive and die, A lone enthusiast near some northern lake, With your thick-coming thoughts for company; And if contempt and slander fail to break Your heartâe'en earn your immortality; But then the hope of posthumous renown Is all you'll have to wash life's bitters down. V Make up your mind to be traducedâto quarrel With your best friendsâto be misunderstoodâ Pronounced unfeeling, and of course âimmoral,â Because you've felt more deeply than you shouldâ Bear thisâand moreâand you may wear the laurel; And may it do you, for your pains much good.â No doubt true fame's an ample compensation For a life's anguish and a soul's prostration. VI Only don't half and half itâbe a poet Complete, or not at allâthe Muse is chary To mortals of her love, and won't bestow it On wooers scarce lukewarm, or prone to vary. If you've another hobby, you must throw it Awayâin this she's downright arbitrary; And if to her you must devote your heart, Devote it wholeâshe won't accept a part. VII For my part, I can't do it, and I couldn't Were I ten poetsâneither heart nor head Have I to make a true Parnassian student, For I must be loved, petted, praised, well-fed, Or elseâgood night; without these aids I shouldn't Writes verses fit to be review'd or read; And, therefore, I'm determined to retire Before the public ceases to admire. VIII This is of small importance; but I know Some real poets, whom I grieve to see Wasting, alas! their fancy's summer glow In cold half-courtship of Calliope. Oh! for some less asthmatic lungs to blow A trumpet to their slumbering vanity, And make them feel (the blockheads) that they're doing Precisely what must cause their utter ruin. IX Up! Walker, where on earth have you been dozing These six Now, alas! nineteen! Jan. 21, 1837. years? Is your Muse effete, or dead, That you persist in idling, punning, prosing, Spinning fine cobwebs from your heart and head, And miscellaneous monthly trash composing For journals never fated to be read? For shameâfor shame,âif you'd preserve your credit, Make haste and use some nobler means to spread it. X The world imagines, (but the world's an ass) That I, not you, am Mr. Knight's Apollo: Macaulay's fame doth far your fame surpass, Praed's Troubadour beats your Gustavus hollow. You'll hardly save your distance,âthough, alas! 'Tis you who ought to lead, and we to follow: We're clever fellows, (and, I think, we've shown it,) But far from first-rate poets,âI must own it. XI But youâyou must be perfectly aware That you've been long profaning sacred powers, And playing tricks with genius rich and rare, In its true worth as far transcending ours As the best China the worst crockery-ware. Now, by Parnassus, and its laurel bowers, Could I but half your inspiration borrow, I'd try my hand at Ãschylus to-morrow. XII I've doneânow where's Sir Launfal? who's the boreâ Plagueâtormentâburthenâbane of my existence; A tertian fever, a perpetual sore, A fool who can't be taught to keep his distance, But raps, most importunely, at my door Ten times a day, to ask for my assistance, (Such as it is) to serve his private ends, When I'm for chatting with my public friends. XIII ReaderâI hope you've read the Faerie Queeneâ If not, don't stop to ask me why or wherefore, But shut at once this peerless magazine, Though it should be the only book you care for, And not to be resign'd without chagrinâ The fact is that I'm press'd for time, and therefore, Must e'en refer you, without more apology, To the said poem for my own mythology. XIV I can't point out the very place, nor will I At threading Spencer's mazes try my skill; As if a man should walk from Piccadilly, To find a sovereign dropt on Ludgate-Hill; Which project would, at best, be worse than silly; But if you've time which you're inclined to kill, Read the whole poem, my dear Sir, and I'll Engage you'll find it fully worth your while. XV Well, but suppose you won't,âwhich I dare say Is not unlikely; for what soul will pore On bards like Spencer at this time of day When Clare's alive, and Rogers, and Tom Moore? Why then I must, as briefly as I may, Concenter all I know of fairy lore In a few stanzas, just to let you see My heroine's noble birth and pedigree. XVI Once on a time there lived a certain man, By name Prometheus, who was shrewd and clever; Indeed, so much so, that he soon began To fancy it would cost him small endeavour To beat Apollo, Jupiter, or Pan At their own trades (take notice, if you've never Heard of these names, and don't know who they were, You'll find their histories in LempriÃ¨re.) XVII Well, what d'you think he did to show his wit? He made a human figure all of clay, Proportion'd and arranged it, bit by bit, And gave it life and motion, with a ray Filch'd from the sunâwhen all was right and fit, Up jump'd this hopeful imp, and ran away; Leaving Prometheus in desponding attitude, Shock'd and astonish'd at such gross ingratitude. XVIII I think it served him right, I must confess, For following so absurd an occupation; Whereas it was his duty to repress The geometric growth of population By all due meansâI can't pretend to guess Why he devised new modes of propagation; When 'tis well known the earth yields far too little E'en to supply her natural stock with victual. XIX The course that he pursued was clearly wrong; He might as well have studied to invent Some means to make men's appetites more strong, Or cause a general dearth of nutriment; However, as such topics don't belong To verse by right, it is not my intent To speculate at presentâonly I Don't think man wants new means to multiply. XX In spite of all Leigh Hunt may choose to say, In spite of all that Godwin e'er has written, I'm strongly for the old established sway Of Hymen in the kingdom of Great Britain, As the laws fix it at the present dayâ So till some new economist shall hit on A likelier plan to make the nation thrive, A fig for Malthusâlet good subjects wive. XXI I'm very far from wishing to improve Our marriage code, like some wise friends of mine; I'm quite against the reign of lawless love, Though all that sort of thing's extremely fine; But since such speculations are above An understanding so confined as mine, I hope I may declare, without impiety, I'm for the present system of society. XXII I've dipp'd into some writers on equalityâ CondorcÃ¨t, Wallace, Godwin, and Rousseau; And trust there's no extreme illiberality In owning that conviction comes but slow: I'd not subvert court, crown, and principality, Nor quash all penal statues at a blow; Because, in spite of Human Nature's purity, I think they'd always add to my security. XXIII Indeed, I never like that state of things Which puling poets call the age of gold; I don't think Saturn was the best of kings; Nor George the Third the worstâand I'll make bold To say, in spite of all that Hesiod sings, That if mankind's opinions should be poll'd, A vast majority of votes would be In favour of the nineteenth century. XXIV Folks hadn't then a notion of good breeding, Were quite unfashion'd, both in words and looks, And never dreamt of writing or of reading, Because, in fact, they'd neither pens nor books; Were absolute barbarians in their feeding, Had no French wines, French dishes, or French cooks, French plays, or French philosophy, in which Old England has of late become so rich. XXV Then just conceive their vegetable diet (Raw acorns, I suspect, are indigestible,) A year ago I took a whim to try it, And found it inexpressibly detestable. Fresh water from the spring (I can't deny it) Is most salubriousâyet 'tis incontestable That most men find it tasteless to a fault, Unless impreghated with grapes or malt. XXVI No doubt, it's very pleasant, after dining, (As poets seldom dine) on fish, fowl, flesh, Before a blazing fire and wine reclining, To dream of fruits and streamlets fine and freshâ Feasts of the golden ageâand thus refining On fancy and repletion, weave a mesh Of most convincing argument, to prove How men might thrive on lettuces and love. XXVII Again I sayâsuch theories are fine. But when one comes to practice, I confess I'd still continue on roast beef to dine, Nor drink one single glass of port the less, No, not an oyster nor a shrimp resign:â I'm not at all particular in dress; But to dispense with it appears to me Wrong as regards both health and decency. XXVIII Sweet Muses! what a merciless digression! Prometheus, Hymen, and the golden ageâ Upon my word, my folly's past expression, When I've as much to do as might engage The House of Commons for at least a session; But I'll turn over a new leafânext page;â This graceless cub Prometheus christen'd âElfe,â Or âQuickââand shortly found him so himself. XXIX Away ran Elfe, rejoicing in his vigour, O'er hill and dale, through river, lake, and sea. An active sprite, and of a handsome figure, And wild, but winning, countenance was he; Shaped like a mortal,âneither less nor biggerâ A goodly work of human fantasy, When fantasy as yet was in her primeâ Not the weak dreamer of the present time. XXX Away ran Elfeâthrough village, town, and city, Made close acquaintance with the sons of men, And on their follies was severely witty, Though things occurr'd, that pleased him, now and then. He thought some men sincere, some women prettyâ But if he loved, was ne'er beloved again: There was a sort of wildness in his eye, Of which young ladies were extremely shy. XXXI For, not to mention his absurd creation, (Which form'd one grand objection, not ill grounded,) And strange ingredients, of whose combination His extra-human nature was compoundedâ The source whence he derived his animation Was a sufficient cause to have confounded All hopes of loveâfor from the sun it came, And so was mingled with poetic flame. XXXII Therefore no woman loved himânor could love; 'Twas not his fault nor theirsâ'tis the condition Of genius, which nought human can remove; If you've a spark, in all your composition, Of poetry, remember you may rove From East to West, and light on no physician, Who can enable you, with charms or philtres, To gain the affections of these pretty jilters. XXXIII Not but they'll all caress you, and admire, Dote on your rhymes, request you to transcribe In gilt morocco, till your fingers tire, With sweetest smiles and speeches for a bribe: And cold the Muse such prizes can't inspireâ For my part, I avow, without a gibe, That to my mind no critic's praise can vie With one bright twinkle in a female eye. XXXIV And there are noble creatures (though uncommon) Who'll give you noble friendshipâsuch as far Transcends the love of any meaner woman, And may be worshipp'd as the polar star To your world-weary barkâbut further no man Must hope to pass that dim mysterious bar Between the woman's and the poet's heart, Which keeps them (more's the pity) miles apart. XXXV That is, when once the woman's turn'd of twenty; Till then, from warm sixteen, I doubt not you May find full-hearted little things in plenty, Who'll love youâor at least believe they do; But when her head's once ripe, and heart half spent, I Fear 'tis in vain for any bard to woo A fair one, whether talented or stupid, Or bid Calliope shake hands with Cupid. XXXVI WomanâI grieve to say itâis a creatureâ A heavenly one, no doubtâbut ne'ertheless Extremely unpoetical by nature, As those, who form exceptions, all confess. I can't tell why this isâindeed I hate your Reasons in rhymeâperhaps they don't possess The organs (as Gall says) of idealityâ They never dream their lives are all reality. XXXVII Theyâbut I won't philosophizeâin short Terpsichore's the female's only Muse; A bard can have no chance who comes to court Against some whisker'd bully of the blues, Who piques himself on dancing as his forte, And stands full six feet six without his shoes. Or should the bard find favour, yet in sooth The course of his love never does run smooth. XXXVIII Shakspere and Spenser, Petrarch, Tassoâothers Of noteâsome dead and buried, some aliveâ The tunefullest of all the tuneful brothers, Are proofs how badly love-sick poets thrive. Few Lauras A statement hardly borne out by facts, if exemplified by the case of this particular Laura. Petrarch's Laura, during the whole period of his adoration, was a married woman, and is described by Gibbon (âDecline and Fall,â vol. vii., chap. 70) as âa matron so prolific that she was delivered of eleven legitimate children while her amorous swain sighed and sung at the fountain of Vaucluse.ââEd. ever become wives and mothers; Few Petrarchs stock their Hymeneal hive With offspring fruitful of poetic honey, Begot and born in lawful matrimony. XXXIX There were three Mrs. Miltons, to be sureâ But I suspect they shortly saw their blunder; The first soon found her place no sinecure, So took French leave, at which I don't much wonder: He must have been (besides that he was poor) A terrible old fellow to live under; And I conceive it must be hard to find A handsome wife who'd have her husband blind. XL But they've all motives, foolisher or fitter. I've heard a woman of true genius say She thought that poets were too apt to fritter Their hearts on light and worthless things away: The observation was correct, though bitterâ There is no doubt we're apt to go astray; Falling in love head foremost, as we do, It's seldom that our hearts sink deeply too. XLI But when they doâoh! then we love indeedâ With true devotion both of heart and brain, Nor wholly from that thraldom can be freed, While life and thought and fantasy remain; Or if we are, according to my creed, âLove's flower, once blighted, never blooms again.â The last line's from Glenarvon, slightly alter'd,â I heard it sung once by a voice that falter'd; XLII And, ever since, its melody hath haunted Mine ear, although I really scarce know whyâ Bur it does haunt me like some voice enchanted, As if the phantom of young hopes gone byâ Wail'd at my sideâand yet no ghost seems wanted To tell one that such hopes are born to die: Such bubbles are as stale as melted vapours, Or lists of bankrupts in the London papers. XLIII Therefore I count myself a lucky fellow, To find my feelings, with my hopes, decay; My heart, which once was as a medlar mellow, Is crusting like a walnut day by day; So that I never shall look green and yellow With melancholy thoughts, but cast away Care for the future, sorrow for the past, And die a good old bachelor at last. XLIV Reader, I hope you're not much out of breath; This last, I own, has been a long excursion; We've frisk'd and scamper'd over hill and heath, Forest and fen, in search of new diversion; Fatiguing poor old Pegasus to deathâ Now let's be sober as the Turk or Persian; We mustn't leave sweet Tryamour forlornâ Poor thing! she's quite impatient to be born. XLV Elfe, as I said, could find no paramour Among Earth's daughters. (I assign'd a reason, And hope no lady took offence, I'm sure; Upon my word, I meant no sort of treason)â âHe did his best, poor fellow, to endure Their coldnessâand endured it for a season; And then he wander'd from his ancient cronies, And reach'd, at last, the gardens of Adonis; XLVI And there, amidst all shapes and shapeless things, The embryos of realities to be,â The unembodied souls of slaves and kings,â The forms that people earth and air and seaâ And pre-existences of rocks and springs,â And many another nameless mystery,â Elfe roaming on without an aim or guide, Found suddenly a Lady at his side. XLVII A Lady!âpray, Sir, was she young or old?â Old, Sir,âextremely oldâat least five hundred; And yet, if you expect, Sir, to behold A wrinkled wither'd crone, you've grossly blunder'd. The sky, you know, with all its studs of gold, Is very old indeedâand yet you've wonder'd, I dare say, fifty times, at the excess Of its imperishable loveliness. XLVIII Therefore you mustn't think that I've mis-stated Or falsified the truth, when I declare That this same Lady (though so long she'd waited For wedlock) was superlatively fair; Though how she was begotten or created, Whence she derived her face and shape and air, The author, whom I follow, does not sayâ But she was lovely, and her name was Fay. XLIX Not to be tedious, Elfe and she consented, After brief courtship, to be man and wife; Nor either, I believe, the choice repented, Theirs was a pattern of connubial life; So smooth you might suppose they had invented Some charm to keep away domestic strife. And they were blest with such a swarm of children As to mere mortals would have been bewildering. L Their offspring was the race of Sprites and Fairies, Sylphs, Goblins, all the preter-natural tribe, Whose whims and pranks, opinions and vagaries. 'Twould take me forty volumes to describe; So much their nature and employment varies:â Hence, though I wish young people to imbibe Instruction from my rhymes, 'tis not my plan to Touch on this subject in the present Canto. LI But of all Powers, whom old Romance and Fable Employ to people sea and air and earth, Were Elfe and Fay the parentsâI'm not able To classify the species, though 'twere worth One's while, and would be highly commendable To do so, and to trace them, from the birth Of the first-born, up to the present day, Through Europe, Asia, and America. LII Goblin and Genius, Demigod and Peri, Vampyre and Brownie, Incubus and Goule, Witch, Warlock, Wizard, Ghost, and Nightmare dreary, Satyr and Nymph, (of whom we read at school;) All these I might describe till I were weary, Were I at liberty to play the fool. But Fate obliges me to waste my wit on Those tribes alone which settled in Great Britain. LIII Some most erroneous notions have been cherish'd, By sceptics, on this subjectâsome suppose That the whole Fairy race has long since perish'd, Extirpated by its relentless foes, Philosophy and Science, who've so flourish'd Of late, that one can scarcely wear a nose, But they'll deny or doubt of its existence, Unless one proves the fact by their assistance. LIV I wonder where Philosophy will stop! I wonder what will next be disbelieved! 'Tis really time for Bards to shut up shop, Thus of their lawful property bereaved. In the Castalian spring there's scarce a drop Of water left, which has not yet received Some taint or other from the analytical Muddlings of science, natural or political. LV But 'tis sufficient to observe, at present, The race of whom I now propose to treat Are not dwarf'd goblins, mischievous though pleasant, Who roam about at night to pinch and beat Poor housemaids, and awake the toil-worn peasant With the near music of their echoing feet; Or thresh the corn, with swift though shadowy flail, Or mar the beauty of the grey mare's tail. LVI Neither (which is material to my story,) Are Fairies immaterialâshadowy things Invested with an unsubstantial glory, Trick'd out in sunshine robes and rainbow wings; Bright forms, impalpable and transitory, Whose fingers shun the weight of wedding rings; But bright realities of flesh and bloodâ A fact Sir Launfal shortly understood. LVII 'Tis true they can throw off their fleshly dross, And roam, unshackled spiritsâthen, at pleasure Resume the same, when weary of its lossâ A privilege convenient beyond measure, Which forms their chief distinction from the gross Terrestrial raceâwhen I've six months of leisure I'll write a learned treatise to explain How these strange beings form a sort of chain LVIII Between mankind and pure ethereal natures, Sharing the pleasures and the pains of both; I only hope that no ill-natured creatures Will doubt 'tis soâI own 'twould make me wroth. One of this poem's most peculiar features Is, that I'm ready to attest on oath The truth of every fact therein recorded, Although, of course, poetically worded. LIX But to proceedâthe Anglo-Fairy kings From Elfe to Oberon, and their horde's migrations, And how they did a thousand wondrous things, And reign'd in peace for many generations, Built Windsor Castle, (all except the wings) And London Bridge, the Tower, and other stationsâ In short, their actions, whether great or mean, Are they not written in the Faerie Queen? LX King Oberon, last upon the list, was reckon'd The wittiest Faery monarch ever known, A sort of supernatural Charles the Second, Who loved mad frolic better than his throne; And, following just wherever Cupid beckon'd, Was not content with one fair face alone; But still from Fay to Fay kept lightly roving, As if the object of his life were loving. LXI Many a curtain lecture, long and moral, From Queen Titania was he doom'd to hear; Many a fairylike fantastic quarrel Their Majesties enjoy'd from year to year, Sung by the mightiest Bard who wears the laurel; I should, perhaps, apprise the reader here, That laws of human wedlock loosely bind The airier fancies of the Elfin kind. LXII Of all King Oberon's manifold connexions, (The loveliest daughters both of Elves and Men) She who the most took hold of his affections Was the young blue-eyed Fairy Guendolen; Through whose dark story, as I hate reflections On such sad subjects I shall draw my pen; Just stating that Titania soon discover'd Around what charms the King's attention hover'd. LXIII And Guendolen's dread fate was never known, Nor could e'en Oberon's self presume to guess Whether she was condemn'd for aye to moan Within the dark earth's innermost recess; Or bound with ice chains to the frigid zone, In her most white and tender nakedness; Orâbut in short Titania was a Tartar, And so 'tis sure her rival proved a martyr. LXIV She left one daughter, lovelier than the Hours, The infant pledge of her unhappy love; Whom Oberon convey'd to distant bowers, And nurtured in a deep, enchanted grove, Beyond the reach of fierce Titania's powersâ Kind reader, when tow'rd Westmoreland you rove, You'll find it (if still extant) somewhere near The classic margin of Winandermere. LXV Sweet Tryamour!âshe grew apace and flourish'd In the fresh vigour of her infant years, By gentlest sprites, with food ambrosial, nourish'd And filling oft her Father's eyes with tears, Swift gushing at the thought of her who perish'd For his ill-omen'd love.âBeyond her peers Shone this sweet child in beauty, and became The loveliest thing that bore the Faery name. LXVI And to that charmed forest, day by day, Came crowds of Faery suitorsâwondrous forms Dashing the lightning from their wings away, And riding on the necks of winds and storms, From distant Ind and desart Africa, And the fair Western regionsâcountless swarms Of unimaginable beings, all Of glorious shape and mien majestical. LXVII In vain they came:âthe coy retiring maiden Received them coldly and deferred to wed; Whether her Mother's dreadful story weigh'd on Her mind, and made her shun a Fairy's bed, Or whether some strange spell her heart was laid on, I know notâbut a single life she led; Choosing, in perfect freedom, still to rove Amongst her maidens in the charmed grove. LXVIII Viewless alike to mortal and immortal, Within that grove her crystal palace stood: Not e'en could Faery footsteps pass its portal To interrupt her virgin solitude; But thither, at her summons, did resort all Beautiful dreams, and visions bright and good, And Powers at whose strong bidding is unfurl'd The deep and secret beauty of the world. LXIX The elements obey'd herâshe had power O'er frost and blight and thunder and eclipse, Could raise the wind, and bid the welkin lower, And founder, in their harbours, mightiest ships: But oftener fell the cooling summer shower At the mild bidding of her gentle lips; And flowers sprang forth, and hawthorn buds appear'dâ For she chose rather to be loved than fear'd. LXX She loved mankind, and all mankind loved her; For, though no eye had seen her, maidens felt Her presence in the green leaves' rustling stir, And in the vernal breeze which seem'd to melt Into their hearts; the humble cottager, Who in that old mysterious forest dwelt, Knew she was near him, and ne'er fail'd to bless The Fairy for the season's fruitfulness. LXXI All kindly deeds were hers.âThe hopes and fears Of loveâthe bridal bedâthe first-born's sleep On his young mother's bosom, bathed in tears Which that first fondness cannot choose but weepâ The young bard's dreamsâthe sports of childish years, By her were blest; and often would she keep Her moonlight watch beside the maiden's grave, And bid fresh flow'rets o'er its verdure wave. LXXII This brings me back to Blanch, whose fate I'd nearly Forgotten, and Sir Launfal soon forgot, Though, when he heard it he was shock'd severelyâ Poor thing!âyou recollect he loved her not, Which broke her heart, for which I grieve sincerely; Her's was indeed a melancholy lot; And I'm extremely sorry to confess 'Twas Tryamour that caused itâmore or less. LXXIII Nor let the reader deem this inconsistentâ For my sweet Fairy was a female too, And females, when they've love for an assistant, And a young handsome gentleman in view, Assume a harshness from their nature distant, And use a luckless rival like a Jew. When once a woman's heart's in palpitation, She's neither conscience nor consideration. LXXIV It chanced that at the time when England's court Was at its height of frolic, show, and revel, To do the new Queen honour, in such sort As in those days was judged correct and civil, The Fairy left her wood, to view the sport, Not wishing or designing any evil; But merely meditating an excursion, To see, and haply share, the court's diversion. LXXV Invisibly she roam'd (this gamesome Fairy) Through hall, state-chamber, and superb saloon; Peep'd e'en into the kitchen and the dairy; Saw all the humours of the Honey-Moon; Laugh'd loud, and sometimes, in a mad vagary, At balls put flutes and fiddles out of tune; Or suddenly extinguish'd all the tapers, Or tripp'd up hapless dandies in their capers. LXXVI But on one luckless morn, as it befell, She went to see a tournament, wherein The brave Sir Launfal bore himself so well, And look'd so handsome when he chanced to win, That, over head and ears, in love she fell, And vow'd 'twould be a burning shame and sin, If such a noble Knight should waste his worth On any daughter of the sons of Earth. LXXVII And from that day Sir Launfal's wealth declined, And ladies look'd upon him with cold eyes; It seem'd as if some spell had struck them blind, Though you may guess the reason, if you're wise. These two misfortunes mostly are combinedâ As soon as wealth deserts you, girls despise; And when you've ceased to be a âspeculation,â You lose, at once, all claim to toleration. LXXVIII So by these means the Fairy strove to stem Sir Launfal's tide of favour, and to wean The ladies' hearts from him, and his from them, And make him weary of the court's gay scene. It was a method which I don't condemn, At least it fully answer'd with the Queen; But with poor Blanch it had a bad effect,â She loved him better for the world's neglect. LXXIX And so she broke her heart, for which I'm sorry, And would undo the mischief, if I could; But mustn't alter this authentic storyâ Perhaps it pleased the Fairy's wayward mood To hurl Sir Launfal from his height of glory, And prove him, in misfortune, wise and good: But that Sir Launfal with poor Blanch should fall In love, she couldn't tolerate at all. LXXX Therefore she hung a spell around his heart, And lull'd his earthly sympathies to sleep, With the strong magic of her wondrous art; And underneath his eyelids would she creep (Of course I mean her spiritual part) At night, and in her charms his senses steep; Till he awoke, with thoughts perplex'd and dim Of the strange beauty which so haunted him. LXXXI And thus she train'd him for her paramourâ Wiling his fancy from the world away; A scheme which prosper'd better, to be sure, In her hands than in those of Mr. Day; Author of Sandford and Merton. See Mr. Edgeworth's autobiography. Whose pair of breaking tits would not endure The strictness of his pre-connubial sway; But married persons of inferior fortunes, Because they liked long sleeves instead of short ones. LXXXII 'Twas summerâthe enchanted forest lay, Rich with the teeming leafiness of June, In the still silence of meridian day, Save when, at times, a low and fitful tune Some wandering Zephyr on the leaves did play, Or the unseen cicada hail'd the noon With his shrill chirp, or, with a deep-fetch'd note, Some meditative blackbird clear'd his throat. LXXXIII There were some children, playing in the shade, In one place, on their earnest sports intent; When a new sound did suddenly invade Their gambols, and anon their eyes were bent On an unusual objectâthrough the glade A handsome Knight, upon a steed sore-spent With travel and starvation, took his wayâ The Knight was young, but paleâthe steed a bay. LXXXIV His eyes were sunk and dimâhis head was bare; His arms hung idly at his saddle-bow; There was a pensive sadness in his air, Which told that he had made fast friends with woe; And yet a gentle patience linger'd there, Softening his haggard eyesâhis pace was slow; Listlessly on his way he seem'd to wend, He knew not whitherâwithout aim or end. LXXXV The little children look'd upon his face With awe, and turn'd not to their sports again When he had past; his melancholy grace Sank on their spirits with such tender pain: The Knight soon reach'd the forest's loneliest place, Dismounted, and took off his charger's rein; Then throwing his worn frame beneath a tree, Began to gather daisies tristfully. LXXXVI 'Twas poor Sir Launfal, who had lately bidden Farewell to Blanch, and all the world beside; And thus far, on his lonely journey, ridden, Seeking some savage place, wherein to hideâ What every body wishes to have hiddenâ His povertyâand so to spare his pride, Not dreaming (lucky dog) of what was brewing To raise him to the height of bliss from ruin. LXXXVII While thus he lay, dejected and forlorn, Under the shadow of the old oak tree, Lamenting that he ever had been born To such a doom of abject penury,â Behold two damsels, brighter than the morn, Came tow'rd him through the green-wood suddenly, Array'd in garments of ethereal splendour, Which dimm'd their beauties to a gleam more tender. LXXXVIII Of an immortal loveliness were they, And yet seem'd mortal womenâI've not time To speak minutely of their dress to-day, But you may find it in the ancient rhyme; Which names each article of their array In terms no less exact than they're sublimeâ Poets, they say, have got into distresses Ere now, for meddling with young ladies' dresses. LXXXIX Short greeting pass'd between the dames and Knight,â Then thus the lovelier spake, with smile demureâ âWill't please you, Sir, to meet the presence bright Of our fair mistress, royal Tryamour? Who hopes you'll dine and take a bed to-night At her near palace, and (the more to ensure Your friendship) begs you to accept this gemâ No brighter shines in England's diadem.â XC With that, she knelt and placed a charmed ring Upon Sir Launfal's finger, who, while raising The damsel, with the grace of any king, Felt, in himself, a change the most amazing: At once his mounting spirit seem'd to spring Into ethereal worlds, and wildly gazing Into the wood, he fed his wondering eyes On sights that mock'd his dreams of Paradise. XCI I've known a ring, placed on a maiden's finger, Produce a like effectâand mark'd with pleasure, To what new thoughts and feelings it could bring her, Unlocking, in her bosom, many a treasure, Which, but for that, might have been doom'd to linger For years unsunn'd and waste away at leisure, Like gold deep buried in a virgin mineâ But oh! Sir Launfal, what surprise was thine! XCII For all that forest-space, where late uprear'd Thick, gnarled oaks, tall elms and beeches stood, To his cleansed vision suddenly appear'd Peopled with an ethereal multitude Of bright and wondrous beingsâsome career'd, Chasing each other, as in playful mood, Through air and earth and water; others bent Their eyes upon him in mute wonderment. XCIII He stood amidst a region fair and proud, Round whose horizon, lost in viewless space, Mountain on mountain rose, like cloud on cloud âForest on forest hung around his head, Like cloud on cloud.ââ Keats' Hyperion. In the bright sunset sky, and at their base Fair valleys spread, and mighty forests bow'd, And gentle rivers ran a pleasant race, And giant lakes lay scatter'd here and there, And sweetest scents and sounds were floating everywhere. XCIV And scarce a bow-shot off stood the pavilion Of crystal, where the Fairy held her court, Flooded with rays of azure, and vermilion, And purple, and bright hues of every sort. Had I the pencil of the Bard Praed.âEd. of Lillianâ Could I suppose description was my forteâ I'd try to paint the place as it deserves; But such an effort now would shake my nerves. XCV But let no reader deem what's writ a fiction, Vowing that no such place can now be foundâ A mere bravado of poetic diction, Existing really nowhere above ground. Know that, beneath the Muse's jurisdiction, Such Faery regions every where abound; Yea, e'en in crowded cities, or in gaolsâ Surpassing all the beauty of North Wales. XCVI Over the portal of the Fay's abode There stood a mighty eagle, of pure gold, Whose diamond eyes with such resplendence glow'd As no rash gaze of mortal might behold Unblinded; but on Launfal was bestow'd Strange power of vision:âthrough the thickest fold Of midnight darkness pierced the bird's keen eyes, And served for gas-lights to this Paradise. XCVII And round the gate, in Spenser's words, there âlay Great sorts of lovers, piteously complainingââ The Elfin suitors of the wayward Fay, Who proved an arch Penelope, not deigning To let them know 'twas time to go awayâ But when they saw Sir Launfal, the whole train, in An instant, knew their fate, and clear'd the portal For the admission of the favour'd mortal. XCVIII Anon, from that strange company, arose A sound of tumult wild and lamentation, Till, in mid air, from cries they came to blowsâ The general disappointment and vexation Ruffled their rival tempers, I suppose, Which threaten'd the whole race with extirpation: But soon those thunder-clouds dispersed, and then The sky was silent and serene again. XCIX Sir Launfal stood beneath the dome alone, (For his two guides had left him,) and survey'd The walls that gleam'd with many a precious stone, The emerald ceilings, with pure gold inlaid, The windows arch'd, through which pale light was thrown On many a pillar'd cloister's long arcade; And, of all else forgetful, paused a space, To view the splendours of that wondrous place. C Through many a long saloon and echoing hall, Fair court and spacious vestibule, he pass'd: Unutterably glorious seem'd they all, And yet each seem'd more glorious than the last; And now reflected from the crystal wall, On his own passing form a glance he cast, And startedâfor his dress, and face, and air Proclaim'd that strange enchantment had been there. CI His robes, when he set out, I grieve to say, (You recollect he'd been in sad distress) Were neither very new, nor very gay, Nor at all singular for cleanliness: In fact, he hadn't wherewithal to pay For washing or for mending; so you'll guess That, though he strove his tatter'd plight to hide, he Was the reverse of any thing that's tidy. CII His cloak and pantaloons were sadly torn, His boots and hose as bad as bad could be; And his thin cheeks, so pale and famine-worn, Told tales of long and abject poverty. He look'd indeed an object most forlorn, And his gaunt steed look'd more forlorn than he: They seem'd (though both their frames were strong and thick-set) The ghosts of Rosinante and Don Quixote. CIII But now so perfect was his transformation, That scarcely could the Knight believe his eyes, But doubted if so strange an alteration Was to be class'd with grave realities, Or dreams of a deranged imagination; He almost fancied that his miseries Had turn'd his brain; for now from top to toe He was bedizen'd like a finish'd beau. CIV And his late haggard eyes were now grown brighter Than ever they had been in days of yore; His cheeks were plumper, and his teeth were whiter Than when, at Arthur's court, the palm he bore No less for his good looks than as a fighterâ Besides, so costly were the robes he wore, That, gazing on his mien and his attire, He sigh'd that none were near him to admire. CV But now before two folding doors he stood Of soft and pearly lustre, and within That hidden room's mysterious solitude Heard, as of waters, a low murmurous din, Inviting noon-day sleep; in anxious mood He paused, as if he thought 'twould be a sin, With step irreverent and o'er-curious eye, To interrupt that deep tranquillity. CVI Thus while he stood, with restless feelings burning, A low sweet music suddenly arose, To which the doors on noiseless hinges turning, Reveal their hidden secrets, and disclose A hall whose light just served him for discerning That 'twas constructed chiefly for repose; And through that tender and voluptuous gloom, Unconscious Launfal view'd his nuptial room. CVII No window into that enchanted place Pour'd the full light of sun or stars or moon: Mother-of-pearl wall'd round the sacred space, Drinking in mellow'd floods the fiery noon, And starr'd with gems that did the darkness chase, Like those that peep through fleecy clouds in June; Whence a still gleam on all the chamber lay, Brighter than moonlight, softer far than day. CVIII And in the midst, with low and slumberous sound, By night and day a bubbling fountain play'd, Whose voice alone the silentness profound Of that delicious chamber did invade; And at one end, as if in slumber bound, On a bright couch the beauteous Fay was laid; Tow'rd whom Sir Launfal did on tiptoe creep, While still she soundly slept, or feign'd to sleep. CIX Her shape was perfect symmetry, though less In stature than most forms of woman-kind; But who shall paint the perfect loveliness Of her resplendent features, which combined All that of Heavenly Beauty poets guess, With all that painters upon Earth can find? And who shall paint the light, not yet reveal'd, Which those long silken eyelashes conceal'd? CX Description, as I've said, is not my forte; So we'll give o'er describingâLaunfal knelt Some timeâhe knew not if 'twas long or shortâ Beside her, and his heart began to melt And leap and throb in such tumultuous sort As he had never, till that moment, felt. He knew at once his dream's mysterious beauty, And saw that love was now become a duty. CXI And so he fell in love without delay, And soon, by dint of gazing, grown more bold, Press'd to his lips the fingers of the Fayâ A mode of courtship, in such cases, old. It woke herâyet the story does not say That she thought fit to look displeased, or scold; But fix'd her eyes, that seem'd with love to swim, Full on his face, and fondly welcomed him. CXII When will this canto end?âthe situation Of these two lovers would be quite a prize To any bard who'd time for the narration Of melting tones, fond looks, and burning sighs. They sat some time, in mutual agitation, Gazing devoutly on each other's eyes; And then the Fairy sank on Launfal's breast, And the whole story of her love confess'd. CXIII She âfear'd that he would think her very bold, For having dared to love himâshe should seem Indelicate to beings of his mouldâ âWomen would call her forwardness extremeâ And, she confess'd, her heart was not so cold As she could wishââand then a brighter gleam, As she gazed on him, through her fond eyes rush'dâ And then she look'd upon the ground and blush'd. CXIV âHe had strange power of witch-craft, she was sure, Who thus could charm a hapless Fairy's heartâ A Fairy's, too, who never could endure A Faery suitor, and had mock'd the dart Of Cupid, till she fell into his lureâ âShe scarcely dared to hope that he would part With Earth's most radiant Beauties for her sake,â She had few offers for such love to make. CXV âYet if he would be true to her, and live Content with her poor beauty, he should be Endow'd with all that Faery-land could give Of wealth and power and bliss and dignity; And she would roam (she hoped he would forgive Her freedom) at his side o'er land and sea; And make him still victorious in the fight, And love him ever truly, day and night. CXVI You may conceive (if you have ever been Engaged in courtship that resembled this, Thus basking in young eyes of tenderest sheen In the full glow of love's acknowledged bliss)â Sir Launfal's answer to the Faery queen; So that I need not tell you 'twas a kiss, âA long, long kissâ in Byron's phrase, which I, On this occasion, deign to ratify. CXVII And when that first and holiest rapture past, Ere yet their severed lips had ceased to tingle, (Pity such kisses can't for ever last When love and duty, as in wedlock, mingle)â Tryamourâsince it's not the thing to fast, For married people any more than singleâ Summon'd her Fays, and bade them serve in haste marriage banquet in the Fairy taste. CXVIII And when that dainty feast at length was o'er, The Queen a goblet to her lips did raise, And pledged Sir Launfal as her spouse, before The assembled company of Elves and Fays; And gave him full possession of her store, And vow'd to love him truly all her days; He pledg'd the draught, and thus, with mutual passion, The pair were wedded in the Faery fashion. CXIX And here I once intended to describe, In the sublimest verses I could write, The feasts and frolics of the Elfin tribe In celebration of that nuptial night; The dance, the song, the gambol, and the gibe, The illuminations, and the bonfires bright; And how the groves were sprinkled with pavilions Of sprites, who came to join the sport by millions. CXX And how, at midnight, the full moon and stars Their brightest beams on those wild revels shed, Gaily careering on their fiery cars, As if they too were dancing over-head; And how Jove laugh'd and Venus wink'd at Mars, And Mars, beneath her glance, turn'd doubly red; And sly old Saturn, from his mystic ring, Appropriate lustre on the scene did fling. CXXI I meant to have described Sir Launfal's sleep, Dream-haunted, and the sights his inward eye Saw, while his bride a loving watch did keep, Kissing, full oft, his eyelids tenderly, And giving his wrapt spirit power to peep Into the secrets of earth, sea, and sky; All which, for want of room, must be omitted, Although the tasteful reader's to be pitied. CXXII I'm really quite alarm'd when I survey The quantity of work that's to be done In the remaining canto of this layâ (For I'm resolved to finish it in one, Whatever Mr. Knight may choose to say)â Indeed, I half regret that I've begun An undertaking which, I see, will double The estimate I'd form'd of ink and trouble. CXXIII Canto the fourth will tell you how the Knight Return'd in triumph, to the court of Britain; And how he was admired by ladies bright, And how Queen Guenever herself was smitten, And suffer'd for her crimes, what served her right; All which, before next April, shall be written: But, for the present, here my toils I close, Leaving the lovers to their late repose. CONCLUSION. âBefore next April!ââThirteen years ago Thus spake I; but or ere that April shone, My fancy's frozen stream had ceased to flow, My dreaming time of life was past and gone. And now when summer flowers no longer blow, And the near autumn stealthily creeps on, I must not with my primrose wreath of spring Mix scentless buds of later blossoming. So if there be who would the tale pursue Of my sweet fairy and my gentle Knight,â (An old quaint tale of passion fond and true, Which did the taste of simpler days delight)â Even to the fount from which my fancy drew Let me such readers, ere we part, invite. There, unrestricted, let them, if they will, Of pure and tender beauty quaff their fill. The Romance upon which this poem was founded is contained in the first volume of Ritson's selections. To themâto all who shall my page peruse, Adieu!âa longâperchance a last adieu!â Friends of my youth, who cheer'd my early muse, In whose warm smile my budding fancy grew, Yours be these laysânor ye a gift refuse, Poor though it be, which haply shall renew In your ripe hearts, as now it doth in mine, The long lost feelings of the Auld lang syne. PART II. POEMS OF RIPER YEARS. SONNET. In gravest toils, at war with phantasy, Nine years, nine mortal years, have swiftly past, Since my then youthful Muse unfolded last Her curious treasures to the public eye. Since then hath Fancy's rivulet been dry, And on my brow her chaplet fading fast; But now my âcrescent boatâ erects her mast, And braves once more the doubtful sea and sky. Fair be her voyage, though she mounts no more The gaudy streamers of her earlier days, Nor, fraught with folly, scuds along the shore, Her trade vain pleasure, and her fare vain praise; But now, with steadier helm, and sail, and oar, Her freight of calm and serious thought conveys. EPITHALAMIUM. Dec. 18, 1834. INTRODUCTORY STANZAS. 1 I stand upon the verge of middle age,â My five-and-thirtieth year well nigh complete; Half way already on Life's pilgrimageâ Here let me rest awhile my way-worn feet, And cherish recollections, sad yet sweet, Of the long distance I have travell'd o'er.â The present and the past together meet In my mind's eye;âthe future lies beforeâ Vast, void, oh how unlike the dream-throng'd days of yore! 2 Vast, void, and dim and dark;âand yet therein Confused and shadowy phantoms I descry Of joy and grief, each struggling hard to win Over the other final victory; My future life the prize for which they vie So keenly each with each; but to the past When I revert my unforgetful eye, Ah me! how that is throng'd from first to last, With bright and beauteous shapes, though fading now full fast. 3 Childhood with all its joysâhow long departed! Boyhood and youth fantastically bright, When, led by love and hope, I roam'd light-hearted Through an ideal world of wild delightâ All these have fled, like visions of the night; And lo! young wedlock's bright and cloudless morn, Majestically rising, puts to flight The last dim shades of lingering twilight born:â Wedlockâwhose sober bliss laughs Fancy's joys to scorn. 4 A few years pass, and lo! the scene is changed; Life's shifting pageant hath grown graver still; The thoughts are dead which once so wildly ranged, I climb no longer the fair Muse's hill, Of fancies quaint no longer take my fill; But graver duties all my care demand, Whereto I strive to bend my wayward will, And raise my pastoral voice and guiding hand To urge Christ's fainting flock on to their native land. 5 And bright-eyed children gambol round my knees, And many a household care and joy is mine; And in my path throng life's realities, Which yet so brightly, to my thinking, shine, That 'twere in me most idle to repine For young imagination's baubles lost: Safely at last, in peace and love divine, My âcrescent boatâ is moor'd, no longer toss'd By jarring winds, no more by adverse currents cross'd. 6 What more remains to rouse the power of song, And wake tired fancy from that charmed sleep In which her eyelids have been closed so long? What stronger magic o'er my chords shall sweep, And once more bid them into music leap? For the old spells have lost their power of moving; My blood's young flow hath settled into deep And waveless peace;âstill'd is my brain's wild roving; My heart hath grown too calm for aught but sober loving. 7 What more remains?âYes! one thing more, at least, Claims a last effort;âby yon friendly hearth Young Love prepares to-day his bridal feastâ A feast where sadness doth contend with mirth; So must it ever be with joys of earth: But mirth and sadness both are lovely there; For never in that house is there a dearth Of Christian love,âlove which 'tis mine to share, Love rich in purer bliss than I have found elsewhere. 8 And therefore, though perchance my faded strains Shall more dishonour than adorn the theme, Let me essay to break my spirit's chains, And launch, once more, my bark upon the stream Of pleasant vision and poetic dream; Pourtraying, gentle friend, thy future life, Tranquil and bright as I would have it seem With household joys and happy feelings rife, And thee, so dear a friend, the matron and the wife. ODE. I The moon hath scarce gone down, And o'er our quiet town The morning star is still his vigil keeping; Night's silent reign hath ceased, And slowly from the east Day's wintry beams are o'er the twilight creeping; Once more is life in house and field astirâ Sleeps yet our beauteous bride?âtread softlyâwake not her. II Awhile let her forget (Since love allows it yet) The agitations of the coming hour; The deep and solemn vows, Which she, a virgin spouse, Must speak, or ere in Hymen's chosen bower, To his soft yoke resigning her wild will, Of sweet connubial bliss she yet may take her fill. III Transition passing strange! A swift yet solemn change, From maidenhood, serene and fancy-free, To all the unquiet cares Which envious Fate prepares Even for those matrons who the happiest be. Thy dream of virgin peace is well nigh gone; Sleep while thou may'st, young bride, still sleep securely on. IV Sleep on; for thou to-day Must take thy leave for aye Of pleasures loved and hoarded since thy birth; To thine own mother's door Thou shalt return no more In thine own rightâa dweller by her hearth; Of all its joys the undisputed Queen; For these no more to thee can be what they have been. V The sympathies intense Of childhood's innocence, Thy maidenly affections, sweet and dearâ The love so deeply felt For all who with thee dwelt Beneath one roof, for many a pleasant year,â These thou can'st never lose; and yet must they, Merged in a deeper stream, half disappear to-day. VI Thy heart must now become The calm and quiet home Of stronger sympathies, and cares more high; Nor ever must thou look, Henceforth, on this world's book With young imagination's glistening eye. The page of vision must be closed for thee, And all thy joys be those of dull reality. VII Where art thou in thy dreams?â Haply beside the streams, Or wandering in the woods thy childhood loved; In sunshine bright and clear Most glorious doth appear Each well-known haunt in which thy steps have roved; And old familiar faces on thee smile, And voices, loved long since, sound pleasantly the while. VIII E'en the beloved Dead Have left their earth-strewn bed, To commune with thee in thy dreams to-night; And each resplendent brow Looks fondlier on thee now Than ever in those days of past delight, To which thy slumbering heart now wanders back, A wild and wondrous way in memory's moon-lit track. IX Were it not well to be In such sweet phantasy Held by the fetters of eternal sleep?â But soft!âwhat dreamy change, Dim, and perplext, and strange, Doth o'er the spirit of thy vision creep? A sense obscure of transformation wrought E'en in the deepest springs of feeling and of thought? X No more within thee plays The life of early days, With which, but now, thy vision was so bright; O'er childhood's mental world A curtain dark unfurl'd Veils its departing glories from thy sight; And thou art conscious of a woman's heart, Within thy bosom form'd, complete in every part. XI And straight, throughout thy dream, New forms and faces gleam, And other voices intermixt are heard; At whose approaching sound At once the depths profound Of thought and will, of soul and sense are stirr'd: And hopes and fears, and feelings vague and dim, Through thy bewilder'd brain, in swift succession, swim. XII And other sounds draw near, And other shapes appear, Commingled and confused:âarise, away, 'Tis time thou shouldst be gone; Some power impels thee on Whither thou know'st notâa mysterious way; And lo! thou stand'st on consecrated ground, Within a holy fane, with faces throng'd around. XIII What voice salutes thine ear? Look upâthy parent dear With wistful eye is o'er thy slumber bending; The dreaded morn is come, Which from the long loved home Summons her child: already tears are blending With smiles on either anxious sister's cheek; Thy gentle brother droops with heart too full-to speak. XIV An hour, and all is o'er; Those cheeks are pale no more, Those tears have ceased to flow: the word is spoken, The holy rite complete, And smiling faces greet The husband and the wife with many a token Of glad congratulation;âgrief hath flown For some few moments' space, which mirth asserts her own. XV Some momentsâa brief hour, Ere for your nuptial bower Ye two depart;â'tis gone, and we remain, (I, and my tearful spouse) In our deserted house, Alone and pensive, between joy and pain, Hope and dull fear, for what may us betide From this day's deed, which yet Time's pregnant womb doth hide. XVI But thouâspeed on thy way, And let thy heart be gay, While hope and expectation yet are young; By thy blest husband's side, A bright and blooming bride, Drink each fond word that trembles on his tongue; Pay with thy looks each look of his fond eyes, And learnâif still thou need'stâto love and yet be wise. XVII In sooth, it suits not thee, Love's sweet absurdity,â Thou know'st not how to play the woman's part; Too bright a creature thou, With that thought-breathing brow, That intellect intense and burning heart, To play with Cupid as weak women play;â Therefore I deem it well thy wooing ends to-day. XVIII For never didst thou wear A less majestic air, Than when, descending from thy loftier mood, Thou didst consent awhile Love's fervour to beguile As more beseem'd less stately womanhood. Nor couldst to cheat those lingering hours refuse In such fond, foolish sort as lovesick maidens use. XIX O grief! if love like thine, Which should be so divine, So heavenly pure a feeling, so profound, Had been profaned by aught Of less exalted thought Than may in woman's noblest heart be found. The blind, the vulgar love be far from thee! The love of impulse wild and feverish phantasy. XX Affection deep, but still, Calm forethought, temperate will, Approving judgment, and deliberate choice;â And dignity austere, And self-respect severeâ In mates like these must love like thine rejoice, From its pure presence putting far away Whate'er our human heart's fond weakness doth betray. XXI Now, all such peril o'erâ On Hymen's tranquil shore Securely landedâwith a frown dismiss Cupid's fantastic train,â Be all thyself again; Yea, far more lovely, from the quiet bliss Of satisfied affection newly born, To tame thy virgin pride, and soften thy wild scorn. XXII Keep well thy wedded state, While in thy presence wait All noble graces and all virtues high; Calm prudence, wifely pride, Love grave, and dignified By mien sedate, and converse matronly. Young bride, our neighbourhood demands of thee Example bright of what a Christian wife should be. XXIII For thou wast nurtured well, Where pious hearts did dwell In principle severe and faith sublime; Love, purer than of earth, Watch'd o'er thee from thy birth, And taught and train'd thee e'en to maiden prime. A high and saintly walk must needs be thine, To realize the hopes which fondly round thee twine. XXIV Thou wilt not put to shame, Nor let dull scoffers blame Thy Christian nurture;âin the face of Heaven Take freely on thee now A Christian matron's vow; Let thy pure heart, while yet 'tis young, be given To the high task which straight before thee lies, And from thy bridal bower look upward to the skies. XXV Forget not that in thee Redemption's mystery Is dimly shadow'd forth and imaged now; Type of that heavenly Bride Who, at the Saviour's side, Betroth'd to Him with many a solemn vow, At the last day shall come in glory down, To share his throne of love and amaranthine crown. XXVI But hush!âfor all too long My weak and tedious song Hath been discoursed to thy unlistening ear: Long since, perchance, 'twas time To check this wayward rhyme, And leave thee free to other cares more dear. In sooth, it is not well to waste to-day, The gravest of thy life, in rhyme and roundelay. XXVII The day is gone at last;â Darkness is gathering fast O'er the tired earth; all human hearts repose; Even Love on Beauty's breast Hath sigh'd himself to rest; Here fitly may my song's last cadence close; A feeble song, yet faithful and sincere, Nor all unmeet, I trust, for hearts like thine to hear. OUR FIRST SORROW. This poem is published rather in compliance with the wishes of friends, to whose opinion the author cannot but defer, than accordantly with the dictates of his own judgment. It was written (as the reader will perceive) under peculiar circumstances, at a time when the author little thought of again appearing before the public in his poetical capacity; and, as he feels no alterations which he could now make in it would so modify its general character as to render it much fitter for publication, he has thought it best to print it almost verbatim as it was originally composed. Sept. 1834. My Margaret, thou hast often marvell'd why Thy husband, famed for feats of poesy In boyhood and hot youth, hath so forgot His tuneful craft, and now discourseth not The music he was wont; and thou dost blame His sluggish humour, which no hope of fame Nor (what should move him more) remorseful shame For talents unimproved, or buried deep In the dim caves of intellectual sleep, Can rouse to due exertion. I confess That thy most sweet, upbraiding earnestness Hath ofttimes moved me to a fond regret For powers long valued, and remember'd yet With melancholy pleasure; yet full well Thou know'st how grave the duties which compel My mind to other tasks; how vast a weight Of solemn vows and cares importunate Lies on the minister of Christ:âshould I Forget the deep responsibility Attach'd to my high office?âleave my fold Unwatch'd, my sheep unfed, that I might hold Communion with a wild and wanton muse, Whose weak earth-fetter'd pinions would refuse To bear me to those heights of sacred song, Where Christian poets, far above the throng Of this world, tune their harps?âshould I forego The studies I most need, the hours I owe To patient self-inspectionâthe still thought, The frequent prayer, through which alone is taught Knowledge of things divine, to weave once more The idle rhymes I used to weave of yore. And win the worthless meed of this world's praise, As then I won it, by more worthless lays, Repented of when finish'd? Oh, not so; Better my stream of verse should cease to flow For ever, than flow thus: if I could sing With Saint and Psalmist, tuning every string Of my rapt harp to the Eternal's praise, Yet not disgrace my theme, I then might raise My willing song triumphantly; and now, If I may keep my ministerial vow, By interweaving with a record brief Of our still recent and still poignant grief, Such lessons as beseem itâsuch as win The soul from earthly dreams pollute with sin To serious thought,âmy toil will not be vain, And we shall find some solace for our pain In dwelling on its cause, recording now Things which late wrung the heart, and wrapt the brow In no unblest, though melancholy gloom;â So sit we here beside our infant's tomb,â The first one hundred and eight lines of the poem were written in the situation here described. And while thy pencil shadows forth the spot So lately known, but ne'er to be forgot âWhile memory holds her seat,â my kindred art Shall summon from their hiding place, the heart, Remembrances most sad, but oh, most dear, And note them down for many a future year Of hallow'd meditation. Dearest wife, 'Tis sixteen years, almost my half of life, Since I, a boy, retiring from the throng Of boyish playmates, breathed my first sad songâ âMy Brother's Grave.â Since then full many a change Hath come upon my spiritâthe free range Of youthful thoughtâHope's bright and beauteous prime, The dreams and fancies of Life's golden time, Have been and ceased to be; yet might I say Which period of the days, now gone for aye, Was richest in Earth's comforts, my fond heart Would, without scruple, name the latter part,â Our nine sweet years of wedlock: Time hath fled So swiftly and so smoothly o'er my head Since first I call'd thee wifeâour days flow'd by With such unmix'd and deep tranquillity, That long our spirits seem'd to lack the rod Which chastens and subdues each child of God. And shall we murmur now that Death at last Hath, Heaven-commission'd, o'er our threshold past, And in our cup of long unmingled bliss Infused one drop of bitterness? Shall this Shake our once cheerful faithâat once destroy That which we cherish'd, in our days of joy, As undefiled religion? Nay, sweet love, Confessing that this blow was from above, Long needed, long suspended, soften'd now By mercies great and many, let us bow Beneath the Chastener's hand, and while our grief Still vents itself in tears, or seeks relief In these and such like tasks, let us confess That God himself, in very faithfulness, Hath caused us to be troubled; that 'tis good To have been thus afflicted, thus subdued, And wean'd in part from this world's vanities, To that good world where now our treasure lies. So bury we our dead. Now let us dwell Awhile on the events which late befell Ourselves and our dear children, ere Death's blow Swept one from our sweet circle. Thou dost know With how much close and cogent argument, Convinced at last, our purpose we forewent Of visiting my parents, that some length Of sojourn near the sea might bring thee strength Long lost, and now much needed; so one day, One glorious day of August, on our way Seaward we fared, and from the wharfs of Thames, Mix'd with grave cits, and smiling city dames, Took ship for fair Herne Bay. Our children three, New to such bustling scenes, with childish glee And wonderment perplext, look'd on and laugh'd, As through the close ranged lines of bristling craft, Moor'd by those wharfs, we thridded our slow wayâ A dense and multitudinous array Of vessels of all nations, mast on mast; While ever and anon some steam-boat pass'd, Bound homeward with its freight of busy folk, Returning to their city's din and smoke, After brief holiday in idlesse spent At Deptford or Gravesend:âstill on we went, With swift, unconscious motion, floating by Full many a spot in England's history Well known and honour'd; arsenal and fort, Fraught with war's stores, fair pier and crowded port, Well known to merchants; cupola and dome Of hospital superb, the princely home Of veteran Seamen, while some batter'd hulk Rear'd, ever and anon, its giant bulk Above our puny top-mast, long laid by, Far from war's din and battle's kindling cry, Far from the roar of hostile cannonade, From shock of clashing armaments, and made A shrine for worship consecrate to him Who sits on high between the cherubim; Now echoing to the voice of praise and prayer Where once the broadside peal'd on the vext air Its dissonant thunder; grateful change, I ween, To Christian hearts; but soon this busy scene Gave place to one more peaceful: we had past The realm of commerce: hull and sail and mast Had faded in the distance, and we went Along the coast of Surrey and fair Kent, Fringed with rich woods and many a smooth ascent Of green and sunny slopes, where village spires, And stately mansions of stout English squires, And villas of rich cits, by turns appear'd, In swift succession, till at last we near'd The mouth of the broad Thames. Throughout the day Our younger children between sleep and play Had been alternating; our eldest boy, (Himself not five) found matter to employ His thought precocious, with observant eye Noting whate'er he saw, and curiously Investigating all things. We meanwhile With books or conversation did beguile Our not too tedious voyage: thou wast gay With the blithe thoughts that in thy bosom lay, Anticipating health, and strength, and joy, Less for thyself than for our infant boy, Whose premature and grief-o'erclouded birth, Follow'd by sickness, long had caused a dearth Of perfect gladness by our quiet hearth. And yet, that day, how passing blithe was he, How full of the sweet freaks of infancy, As to and fro he paced along the deck Hand-led, with restless step; or round thy neck Flinging his passionate arms, with sportive glee Mimick'd the hiss of the resentful sea, Cloven by our keel; or gazed, with wistful eyes, And heart of wonder, on some new found prize, Soon chang'd for other novelty;âthat look Or his, I well remember, quickly took The notice of one shipmate, who to me Exclaim'd with air of thoughtful gravity, âThat child will be no common one.â Alas! How strangely that prediction came to pass! Why dwell upon our landing? why recall The toils and disappointments, one and all, Of our whole search for lodgings? in few days All was arranged, and we were free to gaze From our front windows on the open sea, Which sometimes slept beneath them peacefully, Sometimes, with wrathful and obstreperous roar, Swept the loose shingles from our sloping shore, And hurl'd them back in scorn:âbefore us lay A mighty pier, bisecting the broad bay With its huge length, and stretching far away To where the waves grew fiercerâwork sublime Of Telford's genius, which shall outlive Time, In Britain's grateful memory enshrined;â On either side our lodging, and behind, In most admired disorder, up and down Straggled the new-built and still spreading town, A chaos wide of embryo street and square, And stately terrace, built for the sea-air To visit with its health-restoring breath, And chase, if that might be, disease and death From drooping invalids. Along the beach, Eastward and westward, far as eye could reach, Piles of unfinish'd buildings did extend, Commingled strangely far the twofold end Of rest and dissipation; here was seen The bathing-house remote, with trim machine Dipping its awning in the waves, and here, Mocking the face of sickness, did appear Ball-room and billiard-room, and gay parade, Villa marine, aquatic esplanade, And sea-commanding cottage. Small concern Had we with the gay world: we came to Herne For health, not revelry; so, in our calm And shelter'd dwelling, we inhaled the balm Of the fresh sea-breeze, or along the shore Stray'd with our children, to whose ear the roar Of breakers was a new and stirring sound, Enjoying their glad wonder, when they found Shells or sea-weed, or pebbles strangely form'd, Or chased the tiny crabs, which crawl'd and swarm'd From underneath the shingles; while the sea Daily, we fondly hoped, on them and thee Shed life and bracing freshness. As for me, My time, thou know'st, was short, so from the shore Inland I turn'd my footsteps, to explore (When first the heat permitted) those fair woods, And pleasant dells, whose leafy solitudes Stretch'd smilingly behind us. The first day, I well remember, I had bent my way With pencil in my hand, and serious book, To seek some shady and sequester'd nook, Where, unmolested, I might read at ease, Or haply scribble some such lines as these, As the whim took me. Such a nook I found Hard by Herne Church, and stretch'd on the green ground, O'erhung by clustering trees, spent some few hours In study grave, beneath close sheltering bowers Most meet for such employment; but what then I noted most, and now recall again Most fondly, was the loveliness which shone In that old church, and church-yard still and lone. A resting-place most fit it seem'd to be For gentle dust, hung round by many a tree Of deepest shade, and from intrusion free Of foot or voice profane:âa holier gloom Rests on it nowâthere stands our infant's tomb. So one brief week was spent; and now the day Too soon arrived which summon'd me away From thee and my sweet children. Off the coast The steam-boat's smoke was rising, when the post Brought thee a letter from thou know'st what friend, Fraught with dark news, and eloquently penn'd By grief's deep inspiration; as we walk'd Toward the pier head, how earnestly we talk'd Of her and of her sorrows, till the grief Of our own parting seem'd to find relief E'en from the deep and yearning sympathy Which we both felt for her; and when the sea Swept me away upon its swelling breast From thee and my dear boy, (whose grief, exprest By silent tears, which, with averted face, He strove to smother in my close embrace, Had touch'd me with a father's deepest love,) The spirit of old days began to move Within me, and almost before mine eye, Fixt on the pier, saw nought but vacancy Where late your forms had stood, the power of song Was re-awaken'd, and sent forth ere long Haply a worthless, yet a loving strain, Which, I well know, for ever shall remain To us and those whose sorrow found it vent, A record dear, a deathless monument Of deep and pure affection, which must be 'Twixt us and them to all eternity. Nor was this all; for when once more I stood Beneath my Father's roof, my tuneful mood, Thus waken'd, cheer'd my spirit's solitude, (For solitude, sweet love, invests each spot, Tho' crowded with dear forms, where thou art not,) And oft, as I retired from circle gay Of smiling friends, I wove a cheerful lay, Breathing affection tender, pure, and high, To Her whose late-found friendship thou and I Ne'er can repay, or value worthily. Ah, me! how sweetly were two mornings spent, When, rising with the lark, alone I went Through vale and grove, o'er verdant slope and hill, By the stream side, and freely took my fill Of pleasant fancies, framing at my ease Thoughts full of love and dear remembrances Into epistolary rhyme; and when Night with her shades enveloped us again, And the last words of evening prayer were said, And, one by one, each worn and weary head Save mine had sunk to rest upon its bed, How blithely did my solitary light Fling its pale ray athwart the gloom of night, While with glad heart I plied my busy pen, And mused and wrote, and wrote and mused again. Ah! little deem'd I, at that task of joy, What deadly pangs had seized my infant boy, What grievous woe awaited thee and me. My task was finish'd, and triumphantly Committed to the post;âbut ere 'twas done, I, though I knew it not, had lost a son! That blow came sharp and sudden; when I sail'd, The hue of gathering sickness scarce had paled Our darling's cheek, and when upstairs I bent My lingering steps, to kiss him ere I went, Methought that there was something in his look,â I knew not what,âthat for a moment shook My heart with vague forebodings, undefined, And speedily dismiss'd;âmy sanguine mind, Prompt to anticipate the best, is slow To harbour forethought of impending woe: And when ere long a letter came from thee, Which told me of thy past anxiety, And danger now no more, my heart believed That which it wish'd; and though at times I grieved To think that sickness should invade the spot Where thou still wert, and I, alas! was not, I flung all fear aside, and thank'd our God For thus withdrawing the uplifted rod. Short was my triumph; the next post laid low All my fair hopes, and plunged me deep in woe. How hadst thou fared thro' all that dreadful time, While I, far off, inditing pleasant rhyme, Dream'd of no ill, save what seem'd ill to me,â To lack thy smiles and sweet society; To think how many a thrilling look and word, By me should be unseen, by me unheard, From the sweet lips and pleasure-beaming eyes Of our three darlings;âevery morn to rise Unsummon'd by their voices, or by thine, All day, though circled by loved friends, to pine For others dearer still, and then at night To miss the pure and exquisite delight Of their last kiss;âto dream of them, till day Chased the last visions of the night away; And the light, darting through my window pane, Summon'd me forth to walk and dream again. Grieved I at this? ah! slender grief I ween! What had I felt had we together been? Had each fierce pang, which pierced thee through and through, Struck on my heart, and wrung my spirit too; Each hope, each fear which shook that soul of thine Thrill'd with the selfsame bitterness through mine; Had I been doom'd to witness each dread pain Which rack'd his guiltless heart and guileless brain, To listen to his weak and wailing cry, To watch his tearful and imploring eye, Craving the boon thou couldst not but deny, One little drop to slake that bitter thirstâ Had I seen this, I think my heart had burst. Yea, when the hour of mortal pain was past, And the exhausted spirit, ebbing fast, Had ta'en the speculation from that eye Once so lit up with infant brilliancy; When the calm hush of that most dread repose Spoke suffering past, and life about to close Till, as he faintly drew his last weak breath, Thou look'dst and look'dst, and scarcely knew'st 'twas deathâ Had I seen this, which thou didst see alone, I think e'en Reason would have left her throne: And what thy gentle soul could scarce sustain, Had crush'd my sterner heart, and overwhelm'd my brain. Why was I spared? with what unknown intent? Reserved, perhaps, for sharper punishment; And oh! more needed, more deserved than thine: For, throughout this, a Providence divine Seems to have turn'd grief's sharpest darts from me, To fix them still more stingingly in thee. Thine was the struggle, while thy husband slept; 'Twas thy heart bled, thy gentle eyes that wept, While death and life contendedâhe meanwhile, Divided from thy side by many a mile, Knew nothing of thy pangs, nor could assuage By speech or look thy sorrow's wildest rage, Nor e'en partake it with thee:âthou wast fain To bear alone that grievous load of pain, Unsoothed, unaided, by a husband's love, But seeking thy best solace from above, Kissing the rod which smote thee:âbut for me The bitter shock was soften'd graciously, Not only by the space which lay between Me and the terrors of that fearful scene, But by a train of circumstances, slight Themselves, yet used by mercy infinite To break and mitigate the first dead blow Which else had well nigh crush'd me with a woe Too grievous to be borne:âmy sterner heart Had been prepared and disciplined in part, For that which was to come, by what was past: The news of that first danger made the last And mortal stroke, though unexpected, still A less undream'd of, unimagined ill Than it had been till then; the sudden call To swift and public travel; most of all, The last few days' employment, which had wrought A world within me of Elysian thoughtâ The sense of comfort minister'd by me So recently to others, and to be Repaid, as I well knew, with usury,â The very thought of thee in thy deep grief Pining for me, and for that poor relief Which I alone of earthly friends could bring,â Even this contributed to dull the sting Of my own sorrow; yet, when morning broke O'er Canterbury's towers, and I awoke From the light slumber which had come to close My travel-wearied eyes in brief repose, When, hastening onward, I discern'd the bay With all its shore-built dwellings, through the grey Of twilight, and remember'd that there lay My infant's corpse; ah me, how dull a weight Press'd on my heart, how blank and desolate The world seem'd then to me! Why rack again Thy soul and mine, by dwelling on the pain Of our sad meeting? Why record the sighs Which heaved our breasts, the tears which from our eyes Gush'd, as we stood in silence side by side In that sad room in which our darling died, And view'd him in his coffin? why recall The pang of parting with the little all Still left us of his beauty, when the day Of burial came, and on our mournful way We wended to the church-yard, wherein I Had mark'd before the spot where he should lie, My last sad office of parental care, The fairest spot where all was passing fair; A pleasant nook at the extremest end, O'er which two stately sycamores extend Their interlacing branches, and the ground, Still without graves for some small space around, Seem'd by strange chance to have been kept apart For our sweet babe, that each paternal heart Might have, when grief's first bitterness was gone, One pleasant spot for thought to rest upon. There, in the stillness of that sacred shade, With many a tear the cherish'd dust we laid, And turn'd us homeward; but still many a day Our lingering steps trode and retrode the way Which led us to his grave; and there didst thou, With tear-suffused eyes and pale sad brow, Sit by my side, and with thy pencil trace Each feature of the loved though mournful place; While, with no unblest ministry, did I In thoughtful mood my task poetic ply, Drawing sweet solace from the busy brain, To ease the pressure of the heart's dull pain, Which would not be dispell'd:âwhen I reflect How long that gift, laid by in deep neglect, Had slumber'd in my soul, and what relief Was brought by its revival to our grief, I scarce can think but that the recent woe Felt by our friends, which caused the stream to flow Once more within my heart, by Heaven was sent In kindness to us two, with the intent That powers call'd forth to soothe their deep distress Should prove a solace to our bitterness. For this we rest their debtors, but much moreâ (Ah me, how much!) for that most blessed store Of comfort which ere long their letters brought, Breathing deep sympathy and Christian thought, A treasure inexhaustible of love, Not of this earth, but kindled from above; Making us feel, in our extremest need, That none but Christians can be friends indeed. And now three mournful weeks were past and gone Since death's drear visit, and a simple stone Meanwhile had on our darling's grave been placed, On which a simple epitaph was traced, Writ by my handâa record sad and brief Of his past sweetness, of our present grief, And the fond hope which ne'er will pass away, Of blest re-union to endure for aye, When death shall be no more. At length the day Of our departure came, and we must say Farewell, with lingering steps and tearful eyes, To the sweet spot where our lost treasure lies. With what heart-rending agony to thee Thou well remember'st, and with grief, by me, Felt, as I think, more from deep sympathy With thy exceeding sorrow, than for aught Suggested to myself of painful thought By that leave-taking. It will doubtless seem A paradox to many; yet I deem That we of the wild heart and wandering brain Are less accessible to joy or pain From such associationsâfind the scene Of joy long past, or sorrow which hath been, Less pregnant with ideal bliss or woe Than others do, whose feelings are more slow, Whose fancies less intense. When we survey The wrecks and reliques of the olden dayâ Old battle-field, or camp, or ruin grey Of abbey or of fortress, we feel less Of its past pride, than of the loveliness Which Time hath shed around it; others cast Their mind's eye far more fondly on the past, And muse so fixedly on days gone by, That they impart a dread reality, A present life, to things that were of old, Peopling with phantoms what they now behold In ruin and decay. So do not we; Our light wing'd thoughts so easily can flee From that which is to that which ought to be, Glance with such swiftness from the scene that's nigh Into the airiest realms of phantasy, That if such scene should raise a transient pain Within the heart, the ever ready brain, Almost ere felt, disperses it again, Filling its place with fancies sweet and strange, Rapid and rich, and ever on the range. 'Tis this, and more than this, the poet's eye So keen to seek, so ready to descry All visible beauty, and the poet's breast So eager to enjoy, so glad to rest, In contemplation calm and deep delight, Known but to him, on every lovely sight Of nature, or of art, extracting thence Whate'er it yields to gladden outward sense Unmix'd and undisturb'dâ'tis this that takes The pressure from our hearts; 'tis this that makes The interest, deep and keen, which others feel In the mere scene of former woe and weal, Known by themselves or others, less acute In us than them. E'en now with careless foot I traverse haunts where thou and I together Roam'd hand in hand in youth's unclouded weather, As love's sweet fancies led us; view the stream On whose green banks we used to sit and dream Of bliss to come, and pleasantly beguile The lingering days of courtship; cross the stile Where first our faith was plighted, and for life Thou gavest thyself to me, my bride, my wife, The mother of my children; pass each spot Hallow'd by feelings ne'er to be forgot; Yet, all the while, see little and feel less Of aught except its present loveliness. This is not so with thee; thy gentle heart Dwells, I well know, most fondly on each part Of all that cherish'd scene, and interweaves E'en with the slightest whisper of its leaves, The gush of its sweet waters, thoughts most dear And recollections nursed for many a year, And to be nursed for ever. So, when we Together stood beneath one spreading tree Of those which shade the grave, a heavier weight Press'd on thy heart, and made it desolate, Than mine then felt; O, not because my heart Had then, or at this hour hath ceased to smart; Still less because my faith, more strong than thine, Soar'd higher from the grave to things divine: 'Twas simply that my nature is less prone Than thine to see, in simple sod and stone, That which lies hid beneath them; is less moved By outward tokens of things lost and loved; Grieves and rejoices, in its joy and grief, Without excitement, and without relief, From visible memorials, and is slow To give admission to ideal woe. So, knowing that mine eyes no more should see My child on earth, it matter'd not to me That I was soon to quit the burial place Of him whom I should ne'er again embrace; Whose infant voice no more should glad mine ear; Whose infant kiss no more delight me here. I felt the gift resumed by Him who gave: The soul was gone, why linger at the grave? But thou! Alas, what pain was thine to leave That, and each spot where thou hadst loved to grieve; How oft thy restless step and tearful eye Roved thro' the room where thou hadst seen him die. How oft, how fondly, thy sad looks survey'd The bed wherein his cherish'd corpse was laid, The chair which held his coffin; e'en the pall Brought from his funeralâhow thou loved'st them all! And when the hour was come, when part we must From the loved spot which held our darling's dust, With what keen anguish wast thou torn away! How, as our bark dash'd swiftly through the spray, Didst thou still gaze on the receding bay, As though thou leftest in that churchyard fair The soul of him whose body sleepeth there! Our journey was soon ended; o'er our town The sun was going, in his glory, down, Bright and rejoicing in a cloudless sky, As we, in melancholy thought, drew nigh Our once glad dwelling:âat the well known gate The coach stopp'd short, and oh, how desolate Seem'd our sweet home!âhow had its glory pass'd, Its aspect faded since we saw it last! Yet was it nothing alter'd; every tree Was still as beauteous as it used to be, And Autumn's mellow lustihood was shed, In rich luxuriance, on each garden bed, Then deck'd with many a bright and gorgeous flower, While hops prolific, twining round the bower, Into our hearts a fresh memorial sent Of our late found, but ever cherish'd Kent. Within doors all was, with assiduous care, Garnish'd and swept, as if to meet us there E'en with unusual welcome; every room Still redolent of paint: and thus the gloom Which wrapt our hearts, grew darker and more dense From jarring contrast; the oppressive sense Of that unfitness which we felt to be Near aught that breathed of this world's gaiety. Even this was bitter; but much more, alas! The sad memorials of the bliss that was, But is not, and henceforth shall be no more. The chair, the crib, the silent nursery floor, Now press'd no longer by his tiny tread; His nurse's empty chair, and unmade bed; Yea, e'en the absence of his wailing cry, At midnight heard, when thou, with scarce closed eye And wakeful ear, wast ever prompt to start At the least sound which told thy anxious heart, Or seem'd to tell it, that thy child slept not; This within doors;âwithout, each turf-clad spot On which he sat, or with his little hand Grasping the outstretch'd finger, strove to stand Or walk, secure from sudden trip or fall; The hawk his infant accents loved to call; The two tall elms shading that grassy mound, Where, with his nurse, or us, on the green ground He laugh'd and play'd so often; each of these, And many more, waked sad remembrances, And still must wake them: on thy desolate heart At first they struck so sharply, that the smart I think had overwhelm'd thee, but that she, Our dear, dear friend, in tenderest sympathy, Sent by strong impulse of confiding love, Came, like a blessed angel from above, With healing on its wings, to soothe and share The sorrow, which in solitude to bear Had been too grievous. When I saw thee press'd, Beloved, with such fondness to that breast, Which is the home of every gentle thought, And every pure affection; when she sought, Still intermingling with thy tears her own, To shew us that we sorrow'd not alone, (I might almost have said scarce more than she,) Methought I could have blest our misery For bringing us such love; for thus revealing The stream profound of pure and tender feeling Which flows from her heart into thine and mine; The richest boon which Providence Divine, Lavish of good, hath on us two bestow'd; The sweetest solace of that weary road On which we travel between life and death, Faint and perplext, and often out of breath; But ne'er, I trust, to falter or despair, While she walks with us, or before us there. A fortnight now hath past; we have resumed Our wonted occupations, and entomb'd (Though it lives yet) in memory's deepest cell The sacred grief which we can never tell To this cold world; to me 'tis strange, that thou Canst hide beneath so calm and smooth a brow The pangs which still thou feel'st; canst talk and smile So lightly, though I know that all the while Thy heart is wrung by recollections deep And ever present thoughts, too sad to sleep: That heart knows its own bitterness, which none May intermeddle with, save haply one, Thy partner, not thy peer, in this deep woe, On whose fond breast thy tears in secret flow, To whom thy secret soul is all made known, And loved and prized as dearly as his own. How beareth he his burden? O, sweet wife, Methinks, since yon dark day, the face of life Is strangely alter'd; all that then seem'd bright Hath been enveloped in untimely night; The spring of Hope is o'er, its freshness dead; I feel as if ten mortal years had fled In one month's space, and wonder that my head Is still ungrizzled. Death's dread foot hath cross'd Our threshold, and the charm at length seems lost Which kept him thence; our house is now no more The virgin fortress that it was before; So unassail'd by sorrow, that even we Almost supposed that so 'twould ever be; Almost forgot (all was so calm within) That we were mortals, born in mortal sin, And needed sorrow (till then never sent) Both for reproof and for admonishment. For years our stream of life had glided thus; The griefs, which pierced our neighbours, touch'd not us; While fortune's storms raged round us long and loud, Sunshine, unchequer'd by a single cloud, Lay on our home and hearth: we seem'd exempt From Nature's common lot, and scarcely dreamt Of the approach of ills, which yet we knew, As Adam's children, we were subject to. And now, not only are we thus bereft Of one bright hope, but over all that's left Hangs an oppressive cloud of doubt and fear, A sense of that uncertainty which here Cleaves to whatever we possess or love, Reminding us that nowhere but above Our treasure may be housed. Shall we neglect This lesson, or with godless hearts reject The counsel which God sends us? Oh! not so, Lest we store up a heavier weight of woe, Bring down more grievous chastisement, and lose The benefit of this, should we refuse To grieve when smitten, or desist from grief, When comforted, as we are, with relief, Such as few mourners share: 'tis my belief, And, well I know, thine also, that God spoke Most audibly to both in this sad stroke, Admonishing of much that was amiss In our past season of unclouded bliss; Of much indulgence to dim dreams of sense, Love of this world, and grievous indolence Of heart, and mind, and will. Is it not well, That the vain world which led us to rebel Should thus be darken'd? what we used to prize Too fondly should be taken from our eyes? Only, we trust, to be for both reserved In that bright world from which our thoughts have swerved Too often, but henceforth must swerve no more. Then let us on, more blithely than before, Whither our lost ones beckon us away,â On to the regions of eternal day. The night is now far spent, the day at hand, E'en now the outlines of a happier land, Seen dimly through the twilight, greet our eyes, And seraph voices shout, âAwake, arise, The time for sleep is past.â Why pause we here? Our path before us lies, distinct and clear, And haply from impediments more free Than other paths of this world's travellers be. For 'tis our blessed privilege, sweet love, That we, while labouring for our rest above, Guide other footsteps thither; that our task Of daily duty, the chief cares that ask Our thought, pertain to man's undying soul, To teach, to cheer, to comfort, to control, Reprove and guide the pilgrim who aspires With our convictions, and with our desires, To the same prize on which our hearts are set: And though those hearts are not deliver'd yet From this world's dull anxieties, yet now Each should lift up, methinks, a loftier brow, And look with a more fix'd and hopeful eye To that fair world in which, beyond the sky, Each hath a treasure of uncounted worthâ A treasure which once held us down to earth; But now, made far more glorious, hath been given By love divine to fix our hearts in Heaven. THE THREE SONS. I have a son, a little son, a boy just five years old, With eyes of thoughtful earnestness, and mind of gentle mould. They tell me that unusual grace in all his ways appears, That my child is grave and wise of heart beyond his childish years. I cannot say how this may be, I know his face is fair, And yet his chiefest comeliness is his sweet and serious air: I know his heart is kind and fond, I know he loveth me, But loveth yet his mother more with grateful fervency: But that which others most admire, is the thought which fills his mind, The food for grave enquiring speech he every where doth find. Strange questions doth he ask of me, when we together walk; He scarcely thinks as children think, or talks as children talk. Nor cares he much for childish sports, dotes not on bat or ball, But looks on manhood's ways and works, and aptly mimicks all. His little heart is busy still, and oftentimes perplext With thoughts about this world of ours, and thoughts about the next, He kneels at his dear mother's knee, she teacheth him to pray, And strange, and sweet, and solemn then are the words which he will say. Oh, should my gentle child be spared to manhood's years like me, A holier and a wiser man I trust that he will be: And when I look into his eyes, and stroke his thoughtful brow, I dare not think what I should feel were I to lose him now. I have a son, a second son, a simple child of three; I'll not declare how bright and fair his little features be, How silver sweet those tones of his when he prattles on my knee: I do not think his light blue eye is, like his brother's, keen, Nor his brow so full of childish thought as his hath ever been; But his little heart's a fountain pure of kind and tender feeling, And his every look's a gleam of light, rich depths of love revealing. When he walks with me, the country folk, who pass us in the street, Will shout for joy, and bless my boy, he looks so mild and sweet. A playfellow is he to all, and yet, with cheerful tone, Will sing his little song of love, when left to sport alone. His presence is like sunshine sent to gladden home and hearth, To comfort us in all our griefs, and sweeten all our mirth. Should he grow up to riper years, God grant his heart may prove As sweet a home for heavenly grace as now for earthly love: And if, beside his grave, the tears our aching eyes must dim, God comfort us for all the love which we shall lose in him. I have a son, a third sweet son; his age I cannot tell, For they reckon not by years and months where he is gone to dwell. To us, for fourteen anxious months, his infant smiles were given, And then he bade farewell to Earth, and went to live in Heaven. I cannot tell what form is his, what looks he weareth now, Nor guess how bright a glory crowns his shining seraph brow. The thoughts that fill his sinless soul, the bliss which he doth feel, Are number'd with the secret things which God will not reveal. But I know (for God hath told me this) that he is now at rest, Where other blessed infants be, on their Saviour's loving breast. I know his spirit feels no more this weary load of flesh, But his sleep is bless'd with endless dreams of joy for ever fresh. I know the angels fold him close beneath their glittering wings, And soothe him with a song that breathes of Heaven's divinest things. I know that we shall meet our babe, (his mother dear and I,) Where God for aye shall wipe away all tears from every eye. Whate'er befalls his brethren twain, his bliss can never cease; Their lot may here be grief and fear, but his is certain peace. It may be that the tempter's wiles their souls from bliss may sever, But, if our own poor faith fail not, he must be ours for ever. When we think of what our darling is, and what we still must be,â When we muse on that world's perfect bliss, and this world's misery,â When we groan beneath this load of sin, and feel this grief and pain,â Oh! we'd rather lose our other two, than have him here again. EPITAPH IN THE CHURCHYARD OF HERNE, KENT. Sweet Babe, from griefs and dangers Rest here for ever free; We leave thy dust with strangers, But oh, we leave not Thee. Thy mortal sweetness, smitten To scourge our souls for sin, Is on our memory written, And treasured deep therein; While that which is immortal Fond Hope doth still retain, And saith âAt heaven's bright portal Ye all shall meet again.â SONNETS. SONNET I. 'Twas my fond wish to greet our wedding day, My Margaret, with a strain of jocund rhyme, Such as I used to weave, in youth's sweet prime, From a strange store of fancies wild and gay, And quaint conceits, which intermingled lay With graver thoughts, and musings half sublime In my brain's cells: all these the frosts of time Have nipt ere yet my hair is tinged with grey. Chide me not, Love, nor cherish vain regret For gifts departed:âwe can spare them well; What tho' young Fancy's dreamy moon hath set, And Passion's once wild waves no longer swell, Love's sober daylight smiles upon us yet, And Peace is ours, how pure no tongue can tell. SONNET II. If I may break my spirit's icy spell, And free once more the frost-bound stream of song, To thee, beloved Wife, will first belong The praise and the reward; for thou canst tell Whose gentle efforts made my bosom swell Once more with love of verse extinct so long; Who first evoked me with enticement strong, And pleasant bribes, from the deep silent cell Of mental idlesse: the next place to thee In this poor praise holds that dear friend by right, Who sheds upon our path so rich a light Of cheering love and tenderest sympathy. High above both, my song's sole Lord, is He, Its Origin and Endâthe Infinite. SONNET III. Dear friend, they tell me 'tis the happy day, (To me most happy) which beheld thy birth, And, ere my name was written in the Earth, Smiled on a rich and bountiful array Of blessings, then provided, to allay My future griefs, enhance my future mirth, And in my future home, and round my hearth, Cause pleasant gleams of light and love to play: Therefore, dear friend, this day henceforth shall be The holiest in my calendar of life, Save two alone; the two which gave to me First a betroth'd, and then a wedded wife, Whom only love I more than I love thee;â My dove of peace 'midst this world's toil and strife. SONNET IV. If I could doubt that, in another sphere, Brighter than this, and ne'er to pass away, The renovated soul shall live for aye, Methinks such doubts would quickly disappear, Friend, in thy presence, whom we all revere; For when thy cheerful aspect I survey, And mark thy sweet affections' ceaseless play, Yet feel they lack their truest object here,â How should my heart endure the freezing thought That all this depth of love exists in vain; Doom'd ne'er to lavish its rich sweets again On him long lost, and oh, how fondly sought! But here to dwell, in widowhood's dull pain A few brief years, then vanish into nought? SONNET V. (CONTINUED.) No, this can never be: we needs must meet, (If my poor faith may to the end endure) Where love shall be more perfect and more pure, And love's enjoyments more serenely sweet, Than here they can be. There thine eyes shall greet With joy, which tears shall never more obscure, Him whom, preserved in Memory's portraiture, Thy heart yet treasures in its still retreat; While we, to whom thy love hath been so dear, (My mate beloved and I) at length set free From all the sorrows of this nether sphere, Shall feel a scarce less rapturous ecstasy, Contemplating the perfect bliss, which ye Enjoy, beyond the reach of change or fear. SONNET VI. When, from my desk in yonder crowded fane, Thy vacant pew my wandering eyes survey, Seeking unconsciously the far away, My heart shrinks back upon itself with pain And disappointment dull; and oft in vain I wish and wish that thou wast here to pray Beside me, and so speed upon their way (As oft thou hast) my flagging prayers again: But when, our solemn act of worship o'er, In pastoral guise the pulpit I ascend, No longer then thy absence I deplore: Nay, can almost rejoice, beloved friend, That I need play the mountebank no more, Presuming my dim light to thee to lend. SONNET VII. (CONTINUED.) Yet didst thou tell me once that some chance word, From these unconscious lips at random sent, Reproof and warning to thy spirit lent, And dormant will to new exertion stirr'd: And doubtless of such triumphs I have heard, Achieved by ministry most impotent, Which God, on purpose of rich grace intent, To this world's strength and wisdom hath preferr'd. But oh! beloved friend, if 'tis delight To turn some unknown sinner from his way, What joy should mine be, that my feeble might Hath help'd thy faltering footsteps not to stray; So adding, haply, to the crown of light, Reserved for thee in Heaven, another ray! SONNET VIII. Our minds were form'd, by nature, far apart, And with few common sympathies endued: Thine ardent and most active, and imbued With thirst intense for truth, which thou, with heart Faithful, and pure, and incorrupt by art Sophistical, hast patiently pursued; While I, in dreaming and fantastic mood, Too indolent for such high goal to start, Have wasted, in crude fancies, half my days. Yet must we two be friends; if not for aught Innate in both (which doubtless we shall find), Yet for the love which thy true spirit sways Toward two dear objects of my holiest thought, With both our future prospects close entwined. SONNET IX. TO THE REV. DR. ARNOLD. Not for thy genius, though I deem it high, Thy clear and deep and comprehensive mind, Thy vigorous thought, with healthful sense combined, Thy language rich in simplest dignity; Oh not for these, much honour'd friend, do I Such food for fervent admiration find In all thine efforts to persuade mankind Of truth first dawning on thy mental eye; But for thy fearless and ingenuous heart, Thy love intense of virtue, thy pure aim Knowledge and faith and wisdom to impart, No matter at what loss of wealth and fameâ These are the spells which make my warm tears start, And my heart burn with sympathetic flame. SONNET X. TO THE SAME. Sound teachers are there of religion pure, And unimpeach'd morality; grave men, Who wield a cautious and deliberate pen, And preach and publish doctrine safe and sure; And many such, I ween, can ill endure The eagle glance of thy far-piercing ken, But almost deem thee from some Stygian den Of monstrous error sprung,âobscene,âobscure. Well! they may rail till they have rail'd their fill; Only let me, by such sweet poison fed, Drink from thy clear and ever flowing rill Refreshment and support for heart and head; Oft disagreeing, but extracting still More food from stones of thine than such men's bread. SONNET XI. Mary, thou canst not boast thy sister's brow Capacious, nor her proud and piercing eye, Nor that calm look of conscious dignity, Which makes us poets in her presence bow; Yet scarce to me less beautiful art thou, With thy dove's eyes, so modest, mild, and shy, And that retiring, meek simplicity Which wins pure hearts, they scarce know why or how; Nor is thy voice less full of pleasant sound, Thy words of pleasant meaning to my ear, Albeit thy mind than hers is less profound, Thy wit less bright. Sweet girl, for many a year, No countenance more lovely have I found; No gentler heart, no youthful friend more dear. SONNET XII. TO WINTHROP MACKWORTH PRAED. In youth and early manhood thou and I Thro' this world's path walk'd blithely side by side, Unlike, and yet by kindred aims allied, Both courting one coy mistressâPoesy. Those days are over, and our paths now lie Apart, dissever'd by a space as wide As the blank realms which heaven and earth divide, And widening day by day continually, Each hath forsaken the sweet Muses' shrine For cares more serious; thou for wordy strife, And senatorial toils,âhow unlike mine! Who lead the country pastor's humble life, Sweetening its cares with joys denied to thine, Fair children and a loved and loving wife. SONNET XIII. (CONTINUED.) So sang I, all unwitting of the prize, Which thou meanwhile hadst won, and wearest now, The fairest garland that enwreathes thy brow, Crown'd though it be for youth's rich phantasies And manhood's virtues, by the good and wise, With well-earn'd laurel. I have witness'd how Thy whole heart honours the blest nuptial vow; How well become thee this world's tenderest ties; And gladlier now doth my mind's eye repose On thy bright home,âthy breathing times of rest From public turmoil,âon the love which glows In the fond father's and the husband's breast, Than on thy well-waged strifes with factious foes, Or letter'd triumphs, e'en by them confest. SONNET XIV. TO THE SAME. In youth's impetuous days thy heart was warm, Thy tongue uncheck'd, thy spirit bold and high, With such blind zeal for miscall'd liberty, That friend and foe look'd on thee with alarm. But since maturer years dispell'd the charm, And wean'd thee from thy first idolatry, With what foul gibes doth faction's spiteful fry, Venting its rage, around thee shriek and swarm! Recreant or renegade the mildest name With which they greet thee; but thy heart meanwhile Is pure beyond the reach of venal blame, Free, firm, unstain'd by selfishness or guile, Too noble for even party to defile: If thou art faithless, let me be the same. SONNET XV. Nor beautiful art thou, nor proudly graced With fashion's vain accomplishments: thy mind By artificial culture unrefined, Not boasting pungent wit, or polish'd taste. Yet seldom fondest parent hath embraced A lovelier child; for never heart more kind, With sweet and gentle courtesy combined, Was so by affectation undebased: Therefore, sweet girl, oft wearied with the blaze Of intellectual womanhood, to thee I turn for brief repose, and love to gaze On thy most innocent simplicity; With joy beholding, in thy winning ways, How lovely goodness in itself may be. SONNET XVI. (CONTINUED.) Said I thou wast not beautiful? in sooth, If that I did, shame blister my false tongue For calumny most foul upon thee flung: For what is beauty? Eye, cheek, hair, lip, tooth, Forehead and form, in bloom of radiant youth And faultless symmetry? Such bards have sung, And painters over such enamour'd hung, And such have coxcombs praised with flatteries smooth; But more than such doth heartfelt love demand, And more than such, beloved girl, is thine: Thought, sympathy, affection soft and bland, Sense, feeling, goodness in thy sweet eyes shine: Is not this beauty which all understand? Which sways all hearts with power and grace divine? SONNET XVII. There are, whose pearl of price is richly set In mountings choice of intellectual gold, And polish'd high by graces manifold; Some such have I in life's brief journey met, Whom, once beheld, I never can forget; But thou wast fashion'd in a coarser mould; And nature, by religion uncontroll'd For many a year, will needs be nature yet. But though I deem thy soul's full beauty marr'd, Its stature dwarf'd, by much infirmity, I honour thy strong faith, still struggling hard With sin and Satan for the mastery; Nor deem I that Heaven's gates can e'er be barr'd To one who pants and toils for it like thee. SONNET XVIII. TO THE ANONYMOUS EDITOR OF COLERIDGE'S LETTERS AND CONVERSATIONS. A gibbering ape that leads an elephant; A dwarf deform'd, the presence heralding Of potent wizard, or the Elfin King; Caliban, deigning sage advice to grant To mighty Prosper in some hour of want; Sweet Bully Bottom, while the fairies sing, Braying applause to their rich carolling,â But feebly typify thy flippant cant, Stupid defamer, who, for many a year, With Earth's profoundest teacher wast at school; And, notwithstanding, dost at last appear A brainless, heartless, faithless, hopeless fool. Come, take thy cap and bells and throne thee here, Conspicuous on the Dunce's loftiest stool. SONNET XIX. Not anger, not contempt should be thy meed; Not scornful indignation; but most deep And sorrowing pity; soul that canst not sleep For inborn turbulence, but still dost feed Passion insane, with vengeful word and deed; And so from strife to strife for ever leap, While strangers marvel, foes deride, friends weep, And good men pray for thee, and kind hearts bleed; Meanwhile, by headstrong and impetuous will, Thou on thy blind and desperate course art driven, And dost the air with wrath and discord fill, At enmity with all, though oft forgiven; Thus growing, here on earth, more restless still, And more unfit for future rest in Heaven. SONNET XX. We stood beside the sick, and, as we thought, The dying pillow of our youngest child, Whose spirit, yet by this world undefiled, Seem'd ready to take wing; when there was brought A letter for my hands, which in me wrought Strange feelings; for it spake with kindness mild Of one to like bereavement reconciled By a brief lesson which my pen had taught. And therewith came a little simple book, Telling a gentle tale of children twain, Whom God of late to rest eternal took From this world's sin and sorrow, care and pain; Thankfully on those pages did we look, And trust they spake not to our hearts in vain. SONNET XXI. (CONTINUED.) So, lady, whom we honour, though unknown, For thy frank spirit and thy pious love Toward him who died on earth and reigns above, Thou hast our thanks for this thy kindness, shown Most opportunely: nor will thanks alone Thy recompense, I trust, hereafter prove; Who to our troubles, like a mission'd dove, Didst bear the bough of peace from Heaven's high throne. More blessed 'tis to give than to receive; And more than thou receivedst hast thou given; For none can comfort, whose hearts ne'er were riven With kindred anguish. Lady, I believe Our earthly griefs will make us friends in Heaven. SONNET XXII. Friend most beloved, most honour'd, fare thee well; All joy go with thee to that home of Love; Whence thou, at Friendship's call, didst late remove, With pain and grief, and anxious fear to dwell. Our gratitude for this we may not tell; Nay, never, till we meet in realms above, Can word or act the whole affection prove With which to thee our thankful bosoms swell. But well I know, that in these painful hours, The comfort and support, which thou hast brought, Hath, in the depth of both our spirits, wrought That which shall live when penal flame devours Earth and its works; a chain of burning thought Binding thy soul eternally to ours. SONNET XXIII. For patient ministrations, sweet and kind; For self-denying love, on our distress Pouring its soft and soothing tenderness; For the calm wisdom of thy Christian mind, With deep experience of earth's griefs combined; For comfort which no language can express; For this, and how much more! thy name we bless, And keep it in our heart of hearts enshrined. But chiefly for those glimpses, pure and bright, Of faith intense, and piety serene, Wherewith thou charm'st our spiritual sight, To worlds which fleshly eye hath never seen; For that thy love, in sorrow's murkiest night, The pole-star of our Faith and Hope hath been. SONNET XXIV. TO MY INFANT CHILD. In peril and deep fear, before thy day, My child, when hope had perish'd, thou wast born; Yet wast thou lovely from thy natal morn, And vigorous health in all thy limbs did play, As if thou wouldst our every fear allay, And laugh our fond anxieties to scorn. Seven months roll'd by, and thou wast fiercely torn By fell disease; but that too pass'd away, Mocking hope's second death; and now again, (Kind Heaven be praised) thy pulse with health beats strong, And thou, untouch'd by any grief or pain, Fillest our home with gladness all day long, Singing, with all thy little might and main, Thy inarticulate and infant song. SONNET XXV. TO BAPTIST NOEL. Noel, our paths, in academic days, Lay far apart, though by one Mother bred, And with her noblest sons together fed On food which healthiest intellects doth raise: But thou, even then, didst walk in Wisdom's ways With steadfast purpose; while my heart and head, To loftier aims and aspirations dead, Cared but to win a worthless crown of bays, Which then, with childish fickleness, I cast Even to the winds; now middle age is here, And haply all my better days are past With small improvement; while thou, year by year, Art hiving glory, which for aye shall last, When He, whose cross thou bearest, shall appear. SONNET XXVI. TO THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY. Well won and glorious trophies have been thine, Macaulay, since we two âtogether stray'dâ (As young bards sing) âin Granta's tranquil shade;â Now far divided by the ocean brine; And thou, already a bright star, doth shine Among our statesmen; yet fame hath not made Thy young simplicity of heart to fade, Nor is thy sympathy less warmly mine. Therefore I trust that, in no distant time, (Thy Oriental toils and duties o'er,) Thou shalt revisit this our native clime, Strengthen'd in soul through that bereavement sore, For which, of late, my gift of plaintive rhyme Such welcome solace on thy grief did pour. SONNET XXVII. TO A LADY OF RANK. Many there be, in these our factious days, Whose hate would unrelentingly lay low Crown, coronet, and mitre, at a blow; Scarce sparing even the poet's wreath of bays, For that thereto they may not hope to raise Their own dull brows:âwith me it is not so, Who rather would chivalric fealty owe To rank and virtue which o'ertop my praise. Oh, lady! 'tis a pleasant thought to me That there exists on earth a higher sphere Than that in which I am content to be; Adorn'd by worth like thine, which all revere; Whereto I yield, with lowly heart sincere, Homage profound and reverent courtesy. SONNET XXVIII. Within two days, (if registers tell truth) I and the nineteenth century were born; Nor let me lightly such memorial scorn Of ripen'd manhood and departed youth. Twin wayfarers are we, although, in sooth, My pilgrimage will soonest reach the bourn Whence, saith the adage, travellers ne'er return; Calm be our final rest, our passage smooth. My path hath been the pleasanter so far, Though haply the less busy; all his life My fellow traveller hath been vext with war, Fierce change, and dire convulsion, broils and strife. Be my course govern'd by a milder star, With Christian hopes and calm affections rife. SONNET XXIX. TO THE REV. DR. CHALMERS. Well hast thou reason'd, Chalmers, on the deep And awful mystery of redeeming love; With argument profound intent to prove How the Omniscient Mind doth ever keep Protective watch on Heaven's empyreal steep, O'er suns and systems through all space that move; While yet its sleepless eyes minutely rove Through lowliest dwellings in which mortals sleep. Methinks, great Teacher, of that Mind thine own Yields a faint emblem, who hast power to soar On wing seraphic toward the Eternal Throne, And Heaven and Hell's mysterious depths explore; Sermons on Modern Astronomy, &amp;c. Yet on the meanest cot where poor men groan Christian and Civic Economy, &amp;c. Deignest thy wisdom's healing light to pour. SONNET XXX. TO THE SAME. Alas! for those, whose bigot zeal would fain Compress and crush, with Procrustean force, All energies, all spirits, fine and coarse, All tempers, feelings, habits, heart and brain, Nation, race, climate, white and negro stain Into one changeless and unbending course Of discipline and form; without remorse Devoting Church and sect to Satan's chain. Chalmers, we do not worship at one shrine, Albeit, I trust, both children of one Sire; Nor would I wish my altar to be thine, Delighting most thy greatness to admire, When on our alien Church its sunbeams shine With warm effulgence of congenial fire. SONNET XXXI. TO THE SAME. If aught of pastoral labour, not unblest, Since youth's maturer prime I may have wrought; If, from the pressure of unquiet thought, My weary heart and brain have long had rest; If, from my own emancipated breast, To world-worn minds comfort hath e'er been brought; Thanks be to thee, from whom my spirit sought And found repose, by youthful doubts opprest. Nor thou amidst thy triumphs, and the praise Which well, from all the Churches, thou hast won, Disdain the puny tribute of these lays: For thou, they say, art Wisdom's meekest son, And ever walkest humbly in her ways, Giving God thanks for all that thou hast done. SONNET XXXII. ON REVISITING LUDLOW CASTLE, JULY, 1836. Three days had we been wedded, when we stood Within thy well known walls (my bride and I), Majestic Ludlow; from a cloudless sky Fell the rich moon-beams, in a silver flood, On tower and terrace, river, hill, and wood; Then my heart wander'd to the years gone by, But Hope and Love to Memory made reply That those to come look'd doubly bright and good. Since then the eleventh year hath well nigh past, And, with our children, here we stand again; Again a thankful glance doth memory cast On years of gladness, not unmixt with pain. Meanwhile our hearts are changed and changing fast, But thou, fair ruin, dost unchanged remain. SONNET XXXIII. To patient study and unwearied thought, And wise and watchful nurture of his powers, Must the true poet consecrate his hours: Thus, and thus only, may the crown be bought Which his great brethren, all their lives, have sought; For not to careless wreathers of chance flowers Openeth the Muse her amaranthine bowers, But to the Few, who worthily have fought The toilsome fight, and won their way to fame. With such as these I may not cast my lot, With such as these I must not seek a name; Content to please awhile and be forgot; Winning from daily toil (which irks me not) Rare and brief leisure these poor songs to frame. SONNET XXXIV. My sister, we have lived long years apart; Our mutual visits short and far between, Like those of angels; yet we have not been Divided, as I trust, in mind or heart. Pale now and changed, though in thy prime thou art, And, in the chasten'd sweetness of thy mien, I read the workings of a soul serene And patient under pain's life-wasting smart. May God be with thee, and thy sojourn bless Near Cheltenham's healing springs, that they may be E'en as Bethesda's wondrous pool to thee, Giving thee back lost health and loveliness; While yet He purifies thy heart no less By blest affliction's subtlest alchymy. TO HENRY ALFORD, AUTHOR OF âTHE SCHOOL OF THE HEART,â AND OTHER POEMS. With no unmoved or irresponsive heart, Have I, O Alford, listened to thy lay; Thy pure and fervent lay of holy thoughts And heavenward aspirations, tempered down To apprehension of earth's grosser sense By intermixture sweet of human love And hymeneal fondness. Under heaven My thought shapes not a happier lot than thine; Who, in life's sunny summer, hand in hand With the dear object of thy earliest love, Walk'st through this world, at liberty to cull Whate'er of bright and beautiful it yields To thy keen instinct of poetic sense; Therewith to feed the pure religious flame Which burns upon the altar of thy heart, And through the inner temple of thy being Pours a continual gleam of living light, Irradiating with splendour, not of earth, Each well-proportioned and harmonious part Of all its rich and graceful architecture. Yea, blessed is thy lot, for thou enjoy'st God's three divinest gifts,âlove of Himself, And love domestic, and the inward eye Of the true poet; while, from earliest youth, Thy soul hath been so disciplined, by use, To wait on duty's call,âso taught to wield Its inborn powers aright,âeach natural sense So exercised and strengthened to discern The beautiful and good, and, when discern'd, To mould them to God's service, that to thee All things belong;âthis world, and life and death; All immaterial and material forms Of glory and of loveliness;â'tis thine To extract from all things seen, all things believed, All things imagined, their essential sweetness, As none but Christian poets, train'd like thee, In sweet experience of earth's richest love, Know to extract it. Such, ten years ago, Might seem to be my lot; for I was then A youthful poet, even as thou art now; And, like thee, newly join'd in holy bands Of fond and fervent wedlock; like thee, too, Had I then newly utter'd, in God's house, The vows of an ambassador for Christ; And, with no insincere or base intent, (Albeit but ill prepared for such high task, And little recking of its weightier cares And dread responsibilities), assumed The pastoral name and office. What forbade But that, like thee, I too should then devote My mind's expanded energies, my prime And lustihood of thought, to heavenly song, Hymning, in strains of such poor minstrelsy As my less gifted spirit might send forth, The truths thou hymn'st; and from my daily walk Of ministerial duty, gathering food For meditation calm, and serious thought, Materials of no vain or aimless verse. So had I, haply, ere my noon of life, Won some poor niche amid the humbler shrines Of Christian poets; and not only so, But, e'en by the indulgence of sweet thought And fond imagination, train'd my soul For tasks of Christian duty; kept it clear From this world's worst intrusions; tamed it down More nearly to subjection to the Spirit; And, while I breathed an atmosphere of peace And holy joy, still drawn more nigh to heaven; Meantime constructing, e'en from what supplied My present comfort and my future hope, A temple to God's glory. Hopes like these, If e'er such hopes were mine, have vanish'd long. I must not think to have my name enroll'd Among the names of those who gave to God Their strength and fervour of poetic thought. The days are gone, wherein I might have framed Lays which, outlasting my own span of life, Should, when my bones were dust, have warm'd the hearts Of Christ's true servants: ne'er, in after years, Shall my sweet babes associate with the thought Of their lost parent the fair name of one Bruited in good men's mouths for rich bequests Left to the pious and reflective heart, In tuneful records of his own calm thoughts And meditative intercourse with heaven. Nor sage, nor scholar, nor world-weary man, Who seeks a respite from heart-stifling cares In Poesy's domain, nor saint devout, Yearning for pious sympathy, and fain To vent the feelings of his own full heart In the rich breathings of religious song, Shall have recourse to me, or count my lays Among the pure refreshments of his soul. My songs will not be sung on winter nights By cottage hearths, nor elevate the soul Of sunburnt peasant or pale artizan, Forgetting their six days of care and toil In the calm gladness of the Sabbath eve, And leading up their children's thoughts to Heaven By grave and pious converse, interspersed With psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, Making the heart's rich melody to God. My spirit must not mingle after death With the free spirit of my native land; Nor any tones, from these poor chords sent forth, Linger upon her breezes, and be heard Faintly, and yet with no discordant sound, In her full chorus of religious song. So I shall rest unhonour'd in my grave, And unremember'd. Be it so. For this Slight cause have I to grieve, if I may win A better immortality; nor yet Need I lament that all my better years Have thus been lost to verse; since graver cares, And pastoral labours, not, I trust, unblest, And study of stern truth, according ill With fond imagination's fervent dreams, And daily intercourse with real grief, Not to be soothed or solaced by the skill Of vain and airy phantasy, have fill'd The hours which else I might have dream'd away On Helicon's green marge, in converse blest With those celestial mistresses of song. Not for these years I grieve, albeit defiled With imperfections numberless, with much Unfaithfulness of heart, and cold neglect Of duties great and many, as I grieve For that, the spring and seed-time of my life, Wasted, alas, in academic shades, Through blind self-love and indolence supine, And rash misuse of all those better gifts Wherewith my spirit was, or seem'd, endued; While, all regardless of its youthful needs And seasonable culture,âowning not The obligation of a higher law Than my own will,âI travell'd uncontroll'd Through all the fields of song, as fancy led, Or passionate caprice; from idle hearts Winning vain praise, and solacing my own With what was wasting all its better strength, And leaving it unstored and unprepared For future tasks of duty. For all this, I am content to be what now I am; And deem such retribution meet and right: Nor blame I any, save myself alone, For aught that hath been done, or left undone, Now or in earlier days; yet I rejoice To think that now a brighter day hath risen On Granta's reverend towers than I beheld; (For so thy lays assure me);âthat the free And noble spirit of her sons hath burst The trammels of that false philosophy Which fetter'd, in my day, her strongest hearts And most capacious intellects to low And sensual contemplations, shutting out From youth's perverted and polluted gaze All spiritual glories,âGod and Heaven; All that exalts and purifies the will, And teaches us to feel and know even here Our everlasting destiny. Not long Might such pollution dwell in fane so pure; And years, I trust, have swept away all trace Of mischief then wide spread; beneath those shades A purer generation feeds its thought, And trains its mental energies for deeds Of great and Christian daring, undefiled By base alloy of superstitious zeal And bigot fury, such as, on the banks Of Isis, darkens the meridian beams Of piety and truth, and grossly mars Their beauty with obscene companionship. So may our Mother flourish while the name Of England holds its proud pre-eminence Among the nations: in her ancient halls, And venerable cloisters, be our youth Invigorated by salubrious draughts Of free and fervent thought; and let the mind Of our great country, like a mighty sea, Be fed and freshen'd by perpetual streams Of pure and virtuous wisdom, from those springs Gushing unceasingly. But thou, meanwhile, In youth, in hope, in faith, in genius strong, Fulfil thy noble doom; attune thy song To themes of glorious daring; feed thy mind On contemplations pure and peaceable Of heavenly truth and beauty; ever cheer'd And strengthen'd for thy high and holy task, By constant increase of domestic love, And fireside joys and comforts, and the sweets, Many and pure, with ministerial toil Inseparably link'd, and rendering back Into the labourer's bosom rich reward. So doubt not that thy name shall find a niche Among the names of Earth's illustrious sons; Nor that, when earth itself shall be burnt up With all its works, and, in the fervent heat, Its elements dissolve and fade away, Thou shalt receive the recompense of one Who put his talent out to usury, And render'd to his lord, when he return'd, A great and glorious interest of souls Won to his love; helping to accomplish here The number of the elect, and lead them back With songs of triumph to their home in Heaven. COME WITH US. Come with us, and we will go Where the Clyde's broad waters flow; Where the cloud-capp'd mountains rise To the dim north-western skies; Where, through many a creek and bay, Doth the salt sea find its way Into those recesses deep Where the mountain-shadows sleep, And the dreary dark pine woods Frown o'er watery solitudes, Framing in those wilds, I ween, Many a strange and witching scene, Far to find, but fair to see, For such folks as you and me. Come with us, and we will go Where the peaks of Arran glow, In the sunset bright and clear, Through the sweet months of the year. There the light of evening lies Longer than in southern skies; There the northern meteors glare Through the murky midnight air; Till, when morn returns once more, Rock and mountains, sea and shore, Glen and valley, lake and stream, Bask in the refreshing beam, With more gorgeous light and shade Than midsummer ever made In these fertile plains of ours; There old Goatfel proudly towers O'er his brother mountains wild, In sublime confusion piled Crag on crag, and peak on peak, Where the eye in vain may seek One green spot whereon to rest; There the eagle builds her nest In Glen Rosa's ebon rocks, Rent, as seems, by earthquake shocks Into many a chasm and cleft, In such huge disorder left That you might suppose, in sooth, The old gossip's guess was truthâ That the sweepings here were hurl'd Of the new-created world. Come with us, and we'll repair To the âbonny shire of Ayr;â To the flowery banks and braes, Where the Doon's clear current strays Underneath the holms which lie Where old Monkwood flouts the sky With its honest hideousness; Ne'er did uglier house, I guess, E'en in Scottish region stand Mistress of a fairer land; Ne'er did mansion more uncouth Shelter age and gladsome youth, In more loving union met Than we shall behold there yet; Though grim death hath busy been, And though oceans roll between Us and some with whom we roved Once amidst those woods beloved. Come with us; those woods should be Dear to you as dear to me; Though you ne'er, in childhood's hours, Roam'd amidst their banks and bowers; Though far other scenes than these Haunt your young remembrances; Yet, believe me, you shall soon Love yon bright and brawling Doon, And those hills and natural woods, With their summer solitudes, And the hearts that in them dwell, And yon graceless house, as well E'en as if you ne'er had known Other haunts than these alone; E'en as if yon clustering trees, With your earliest sympathies, In their robes of smiling green, Still had intermingled been; E'en as if yon river clear, Murmuring to your infant ear, First had, for your spirit, found Entrance to the world of sound. Six and twenty years had flown, Ere by me those scenes were known; Yet have they to me become Sacred as my childhood's home; Dear as though I ne'er had stray'd From their sweet and sylvan shade. There, in Love's delicious morn, Ere our eldest child was born, Ere youth's latest dream was fled, Ere young Phantasy was dead, Ere the Husband or the Wife Felt the real pains of Life, Ere Death's touch had harm'd us yet, Roam'd I with my Margaret: There, our gentle friends and true, Gladly would we roam with you. Come with us; our time is short In those cherish'd haunts to sport. All things mortal wax and wane, Nor may we, even now, complain That from us and ours, alas! Must these pleasant places pass; That for other eyes than ours We have twined our favourite bowers; That our own beloved Doon Must for other ears too soon Sing his blithe and jocund song Those o'erhanging banks along; And that stranger steps must roam Through our old ancestral home; Unfamiliar forms be seen Where our loved and lost have been; Unfamiliar spirits dwell In the rooms we loved so well, Homely though perchance they be In their old simplicity. So it is;âwe find on earth No continuing home or hearth; Still through chance and change we roam, Seeking better lands to come. Come with us, and we will go Where the streams of Zion flow Through the city of our God, Which no foot profane hath trod. Change and sorrow come not there; All is fix'd, as all is fair. Earthly glories fade and fleet, Nothing long on Earth is sweet; Though our woods may still be green, And sweet Doon may gush between, Clear and sparkling as of old, Yet no more may we behold On his banks the forms that gave Half their gloryâfor the grave Hath already closed o'er some; Others in their Eastern home, Wander, nightly, in their dreams, Through the woods and near the streams, Which, when life is worn away, And their temples strewn with grey, And their hearts' best fervour o'er, Haply they shall see once more; Seeâby alien lords possest, When our griefs are gone to rest. Come with us;âlet Memory still Feed and cherish, as she will, Forms of beauty gone and past, Pleasures too intense to last. Meet support therein may be For the heart's infirmity; But for us a brighter home Spreads its glories;âlet us come Whither Faith, and Hope, and Love, Urge our laggard steps above: Let us such high call obey, Help each other on the way; Through the narrow entrance press Of the realm of righteousness; Where, in joy's eternal river, This world's griefs are lost for ever. MIDSUMMER MUSINGS. With slow and toilsome course, this summer noon Have I, in pensive and fantastic mood, Forsaking, for a time the converse bland And fair urbanities, which suit so well Yon English hearth and household, wound my way Up to this green hill's topmost eminence; Whence, with a quick and comprehensive glance, Which fills the soul with beauty, the glad eye Takes in a vast and richly-varied plain Of England's own fertility, adorn'd, At intervals, with old ancestral halls, Trim farms and village spires, which crown the hills, Or just out-top the dark and leafy woods, O'er which the blue smoke, like a level sea, Delights to linger; to the thoughtful heart Conveying no inapt or empty type Of that which still hath been, and still shall be, Despite the vaunts of democratic hate, And turbulent assaults of godless men, Our country's strength and glory;âhousehold love And social union, strengthen'd, not dissolv'd, By meet gradation of well-order'd ranks, Each melting into each, and, by the warmth Of undefiled religion's genial sun, Matured and cherish'd. On the extremest verge Of the remote horizon, wavy lines Of hills, which might almost assume the style And dignity of mountains, mark the site Of my paternal home, whereto, so oft As summer's fervour or midwinter's frost Restored our liberty, from school return'd, Once more I mingled with the noisy group Of brothers and of sisters, who, since then, Have parted,âall upon their several paths Of destiny or duty, through the world To fare as Heaven may guide them. One, alas! Slumbers already, many a fathom deep, Beneath the stormy and tumultuous swell Of the âstill vext Bermoothes.â One, cut off In childhood's ripest bloom, my earliest song In fitting strains bewail'd. A third, the heat Of India's burning suns is withering fast, Albeit in youth's maturest lustihood. A fourth, who went from home with gallant port, Wearing a soldier's frankness on his brow, And, in his young heart, proudly cherishing A soldier's noblest zeal, had found a home, When last he wrote, near Afric's southern cape; And there, in tranquil and inglorious ease, Forsaking the plumed host and tented field For peaceful tillage and the hunter's sport, Was fashioning his idle sword and spear To ploughshare and to pruning-hook, content To learn war's trade no more, but to forego Its present honours and its future hopes For liberty and rest. In that old house, Cleobury Mortimer Vicarage, in Shropshire.âEd. Once echoing to the loud obstreperous mirth Of ten wild boys and girls, now, in their age, My parents dwell alone, from time to time Gladden'd and cheer'd by visits few and brief Of children and of grandchildren, whose sports Haply recall the days of other years, When we all dwelt about them, and diffuse A gleam of pleasant light athwart the gloom (If gloom indeed it be) which settles now On all that large remainder of the year Mark'd by our absence. Visits such as these Should constitute, methinks, a last firm bond Of sympathy between their souls and Earth, And cherish still, even in their heart of hearts, The light of earthly joy, sweetening the eve Of this their mortal day, and with the hope (Now brightening hour by hour) of fairer worlds, And a more rich inheritance to come, Connecting the remembrance of past bliss, And sense of present comfort,âfeeding thus The incense of perpetual gratitude Breathed from their hearts to Heaven;ânor let my own Forget how large a debt of thankfulness Is due to Him, who to His other gifts, Unnumber'd and unmeasured, adds this too,â That from my pastoral dwelling, by the banks Of Avon, I can still, from year to year, With the beloved co-partner of my joys And soother of my sorrows, and with those Dear babes who fill our happy home with smiles, Revisit my paternal roof, and cheer Their hearts, who gave me being, with the sound Of children's voices, and make glad their hearth With the blest sight of our full happiness. Such be our task to-morrow; here to-day We tarry with most kind, though late-found friends, Whose venerable mansion Mere Hall, the seat of E. Bearcroft, Esq., in Worcestershire.âEd. at the foot Of this fair hill, in all the state grotesque Of England's olden architecture, lifts Its chequer'd front, with timbers huge inlaid, And fair white plaister; and with gables tall Surmounted, from whose antique windows quaint The eye looks through a stately avenue Of elms, which have outlived the chance and change Of centuries, into a verdant plain With woods and waving corn-fields interspersed;â Meet dwelling for a family most rich In all that constitutes the genuine worth Of our provincial gentry. In that house A pleasant group of friends is gather'd now In mirthful converse and communion bland Of thought and feeling;âone most dear to me, And many to each other scarce less dear; Brothers and sisters,âsome in youth's full prime, And some in childhood's tenderest innocence, Link'd firmly, each to each, by mutual ties Of firm affection, and beneath the eye Of one who wears upon her stately brow The stamp and impress of true ladyhood, And in her heart the wisdom and the love Of English mothers, train'd with holiest care To exercise of virtues such as thrive And blossom best by England's own firesides, And in the breath of her free atmosphere. And one there is whom nature hath endow'd With voice and soul of melody, than whom The thrush and blackbird sing no richer strains, Nor with more natural fervour gushing forth From the heart's hidden founts;âand yet hath art Fulfill'd in her its perfect work, nor oft On the fastidious ear of critic fall Notes warbled with more nice and finish'd skill Than those which flow, unforced and uncontroll'd From her melodious utterance. Dames there be, By nature and fine art alike endued With varied powers of song, potent to lull The charmed sense, or raise the enraptured soul To loftiest ecstasy, who yet dispel Their strong enchantments by ill-timed caprice And wayward affectation; marring still Our pleasure, and the triumphs of their art, By most preposterous vanity, which yields, With feign'd reluctance, an ill-graced assent To what it longs to grant, until desire, Too long deferr'd, loses its poignancy, And chill'd enjoyment sickens. Unlike these, The maid of whom I speak unlocks, with free And liberal grace, her floodgates of sweet sound, And pours, at will, on our insatiate sense Rich streams of never-dying melody; Neither dissembling, with ill-acted show Of modest self-disparagement, the worth And richness of her gifts, nor on our choice Obtruding them unask'd, but, with the pure And simple kindness of a natural heart, Imparting to our needs her special share Of nature's dispensation,âbreathing thus An atmosphere around her of sweet mirth And universal kindliness;ânor yet Disdains she from the heights of sacred song, Or the rich warblings of Italian art, Into the lowliest regions to descend Of homely music,âto the simple taste Of childhood now attuning her sweet voice In laugh-provoking ballads, and again With some pathetic lay from Scottish land, Which breathes the fervour of her own full heart, Filling our eyes with tears. All joy attend That gentle songstress, whose remember'd strains I trust shall haunt my sense in future years, When the ârude shocks and buffets of the world,â And long experience of life's daily ills, Make Memory's stores more precious. But I hear Below me, in the hill's green winding paths, The voices of my children, in wild mirth Through intertangled boughs in search of me, Their way exploring to this yew-tree bower In which I sit and muse, protected well By its dark shade from the oppressive beams Of the meridian sun, to my weak eyes Fraught with sharp pain and inflammation dire, And threatening ever these asthmatic lungs, With agony of respiration choked, And spasms catarrhal; for, to me, the prime And lustihood of summer ever brings Return of fell disease,âmost fell in this,â That I no more, for ever, may enjoy The sweetness of the year;âthat what, in youth And earlier boyhood, I so fondly loved, Yea, and still love with all a poet's heart,â The gorgeousness of nature at her noon,â Must ever be associate in my thought With sickness and dire suffering; that no more May I behold the full magnificence Or of the rising or the setting sun, Nor welcome to my brow the noonday breeze, Nor see Eve's star arise, nor greet the moon, When, from the breathless sky, she pours her light On the rich foliage of midsummer woods, With full and free enjoyment, unalloy'd By pain or apprehension;âthat the toils And sports of summer, its sweet sounds and sights, To me must be forbidden;âne'er again The hay-field's fragrant breath must tempt my sense, Nor the returning and high-laden wain, Cheer'd by the shouts of joyous haymakers Proclaiming harvest home, invite me too To share their rude festivities; and when The cloudless skies and verdant fields of June Tempt friends and neighbours to beguile a day In the green woods, or by the river's marge, With mirth and music, I perforce must flee Such festive meetings, and, close pent at home In solitude and shade, shut out the light Of the bright skies, and chase the pleasant breeze From my closed windows; or o'ercloud the mirth And mar the full enjoyment of kind friends With the discordant and unwelcome sound Of gasps spasmodic, with red tearful eyes And ceaseless sternutation. Not for this Let me repine; small chastisement, I ween, For disobedience great and oft renew'd To Heaven's eternal laws: for years mis-spent, And duties unfulfill'd;ânor let me be Unthankful for this sharp admonishment Of nature's imperfection; of the doom Most righteously awarded to our race, Forbidding us to find, in this dark earth, That which we look for in the world to come,â Enjoyment unalloy'd; let me confess That 'tis most well my sensual heart, which dotes On earthly treasures with too fond a love, Should have that love embitter'd and so raised To objects more sublime; and let me still Feel grateful for the strong and vigorous health Which, from ripe Autumn to expiring Spring, Nerves my firm limbs; nor less for that pure warmth Of conjugal affection, which consoles And mitigates my sickness, making glad The chamber of my pain with sympathy. There is no grief, even on this sinful earth, Without its consolation; none which faith And patient love may not convert to bliss, Or make at least the path to it; and if Such be indeed our sorrows,âfor our joys, Our sweet refreshments, richly interspersed At intervals through all the narrow road Which leads to life eternalâfor all these What thanks shall we repay? Even now, methinks, From this secluded harbour I look down On a fresh joy, provided by Heaven's love To cheer me on my way;âa new-found store Of pleasant thoughts and sweet remembrances, Enriching my calm years of middle age, And rendering compensation for whate'er Of injury or loss the flight of time May have inflicted on me. Thus life's path, To the affectionate and thoughtful heart, Can never prove a desart; by its side Fresh springs gush brightly forth from time to time, As old ones are dried up or left behind In our swift pilgrimage; yet few, I deem, Numbering my years, can reckon up like store Of youth's surviving blessings; Death as yet Hath mercifully dealt with us and ours; And scarce a face which, fifteen years ago, Smiled on me in my academic prime, Hath lost as yet the lineaments and hue Of mortal life. A fortnight scarce hath past Since, in the great metropolis, we met,â I and my youthful peers of Trinity, Now nigh our noon of life; a motley band Of poets and ripe scholars, once renown'd For feats of numerous verse and sparkling prose; Now each on graver toils and cares intent In his particular sphere; some hard beset By life's sharp ills,âof wife or child bereft; Some deep immersed in senatorial wiles, Quenching the quiet spirit of the Muse In strife political; and some there were By bright and blooming families begirt, Yet still retaining, amid household cares And toils professional, the cheerful laugh And boon companionship of earlier days;â Sober'd, not sadden'd, by life's chance and change, Its joys and sorrows:âone (in youth's bright morn, My poet-friend, though high, as Heaven o'er Earth, Towering above me in all gifts and powers Which constitute the poet) hath foregone His natural birth-right, and those airy dreams Of fellowship in song, which we two framed Erewhile on Cam's green marge,ânow to stern toil And loftiest cares devote:âfor this his choice, Itself most wise, and in submission shaped To Providential guidance, all respect And rich reward be his; nor let me grieve That Heaven hath cast our several lots apart, And will'd that diverse interests, diverse cares, Should grow and gather round us;âbut let each Take the more earnest heed, lest absence chill His heart's best fervour; lest he live too much In his peculiar world, with separate hopes And separate fears encompass'd, till the free And open passage of congenial thought, Which yet joins heart to heart, shall be block'd up, And each need closer intercourse with each To clear it of obstruction. But be this Even as it may;âfrom all that hath been lost, And all that yet remains, our hearts may learn Some profitable lessons. Upon earth Decay and renovation, in close track, Follow each other; friendships wax and wane; Old joys give place to new ones; and while thus Provision is still made for life's support And bountiful refreshment,âwhile the heart Is cheer'd and strengthen'd for its daily task Of duty, by accessions many and rich Of ever freshening solace,âstill we learn That all is here unstable; that, till death, We must not hope to lay our weary heads On the soft lap of permanent repose; Nor find secure and never-failing rest For our foot's sole. Such comfort as Heaven gives Let us enjoy with thankfulness; but stillâ Remembering that our home is not on earth, Nor earthy the affections and the joys Which must make glad that home,âwith steadfast aim Pursue our heavenward path, from time to time Refresh'd, in this world's wilderness, by springs Of worldly joyance, but still looking on, Beyond created things, to that full bliss Which the regenerate and triumphant soul, After its weary conflicts, by God's power, Through faith, unto salvation safely kept, Shall, in His presence, endlessly enjoy. LOVE'S MAY DAY. 'Tis the sweet sixteenth of Mayâ How shall we keep holiday? What the rites to Cupid due? What to Hymen fond and true? Dearest, where shall we find leisure For that feast of holiest pleasure Which this honour'd day demands, Now dull care hath fill'd our hands With such duties, sad and sober, As from April to October, Thence to April round again, Make us toil with might and main, Leaving scarce a moment free For the freaks of phantasy; For the dreams which disappear Full three quarters of the year, In our bosoms buried deep Till the spring breeze breaks their sleep,â When once more, like bees, they swarm In the sunshine bright and warm; For the dear and dreamy talk Of a calm connubial walk, When we two once more may wander, Free to prate and free to ponder On those days of youthful bliss, When our lips first learnt to kiss; When, in Windsor's forest shade, Thou a young and dreaming maid, I a fond and fervent swain, Weak of heart and wild of brain, Of love's folly took our fill, âWandering at our own sweet will?â Now the days are alter'd quite, Thou must work and I must write; Thou hast children three to teach, I have sermons three to preach, Thou hast clothes to make and mend, I've a straying flock to tend; And the world hath grown so real, That to roam in realms ideal As we roved in days of yoreâ We must think of it no more. Fancy's reign is past and done, That of sober truth begun. How then, this sweet morn of May, Shall we two keep holiday? We will keep it as we may. Though no frolic feast we make, Yet our hearts shall be awake; And our silent thoughts shall flee To the realms of Memory. We'll direct their stream to flow Backward to nine years ago: To the burning words that bound This sweet chain our souls around; To the first tumultuous kiss, Harbinger of years of bliss; To the mingled tear and smile, Throb and thrill at Upton stile; While full many a heart-flash'd glance, Brightening either countenance, Tells that, though nine years are over, Each of us is still a lover; Each, as every year hath flown, Happier still and fonder grown. Thoughts like these 'tis meet we call To our silent festival; Thoughts like theseâbut is there nought, In the whole wide realm of Thought, Meeter yet our hearts to cheer On this day, of all the year Fitliest due to musings high, And divine philosophy? Still our life is in its prime; Still doth hope make friends with time; Still unseam'd is either brow; Yet I trust we are not now Such in heart and mind and will,â So unwean'd from folly still, As when first love's fetters tied The young bridegroom to the bride. Forward let us bend our eyes To our home beyond the skies; For thereon, without amaze, Faith hath made us free to gaze; And though youth hath past away, And my locks may soon turn grey, And thy full and flashing eye Lose its present brilliancy; Yet such tokens we may greet Of old Time's advancing feet, With a holy joy that he Ushers in Eternity; And that all which fleets and fades As he stealthily invades That bright face and form of thine, And these sturdy limbs of mine, Doth a growing change prepare, Laying thus our spirits bare; Lightening slowly, day by day, This their present load of clay, That, on unencumber'd wing, Heavenward they may learn to spring: While, as we more fit become For our everlasting home, In our children we may see All that we were wont to beâ Whatsoever gifts and powers In our youth's best days were ours,â As on a perennial stem, Blossoming again in them. Thus, though far from moonlit woods, Streams, and bowers, and solitudes; Far from wild romantic ramblesâ Far from lonely brakes and bramblesâ Compass'd round by this world's din, But with love and peace withinâ Thus, this sweet sixteenth of May, Will we two keep holiday. LOVE IN ABSENCE. January, 1832. Dost thou remember, dearest, how the bird,â The shrill, sweet warbler of another clime, Which, with its mate, I gave thee on the morn Of our last wedding-dayâdost thou remember How, while one cage held him and his sweet bride In joint imprisonment, the happy bird Forgot his natural melody, and, wrapt (For so it seem'd) in tranquil contemplation Of his connubial blessedness, sate dumb âFrom morn to noon, from noon to dewy eve,â Save when at intervals, with amorous chirp, His little heart breathed forth its overflowings Of quiet joy and deep contented love. But when our harsh and marriage-slighting edict Decreed their separation, and the pair, Reluctantly divorced, were fain to nurse Their unquench'd loves in solitary cages, And forced disunion both of bed and board, Then what a sudden gush of pent-up song Burst from the widower's throat! as tho' the passion Kindled by nature in his fiery heart, And finding, until then, congenial vent In interchange of amorous sympathies With his own chosen mate,âwas now constrain'd To seek some new, unwonted utteranceâ Best found in song. Herein methinks, the bird Is an apt emblem of his wayward donor, Who, for six blissful years, link'd to thy side In loving and most blest companionship, Hath, all that time, lock'd up his vaunted store Of thought poetic, breathing scarce a note Of glad or mournful, light or serious song, Not ode sublime, nor melting elegy, Nor lofty-sounding epic. Why was this? Why, but because the wild and passionate feelings, The dim, mysterious instincts of his nature, The struggling impulse of the Muse within him, Which, in the days of his unmated youth, Found vent in song and minstrelsy, have flow'd Since thou wert his, in a far better channel. Spending their once tumultuous energy In exercises sweet of chasten'd love And mild endearments. Around thee have cluster'd The tender thoughts, the rich imaginations, The impulses and instincts, strange and strong, The dreams and visions and wild phantasies, Which else perhaps had wander'd unrestrain'd Through many a devious track of poesy; But, tamed by the strong magic of thy charms, Have all foregone their rovings, and so mingled Their manifold, and oft contending, currents In one deep, tranquil, mighty stream of love. Thus is it that, for very blessedness, My Muse hath long been silentâlong forgotten The venturous flights of her less happy days; But now that, summon'd by imperious duty, And, for a time, foregoing love's sweet solace For truest Friendship's sake, I dwell apart From thee and my sweet childrenânow once more The old imaginations wake within me; Once more the wild and long forgotten music Of teeming thoughts and fancies floats and thrills Through my admiring brain; once more I seem To walk in that bright land of fairy vision Which is the poet's birthright,âhis asylum From all the harsh and sorrowful realities Which vex him in this dull and daylight world. Now, like our luckless bird, I seem endow'd With sudden and unwonted power of song; Which, if it may attain such tuneful pitch As erst it reach'dâsuch as may not disgrace The promise of my earlier utterance,â To whom but thee, my own and only love, Should its first notes be consecrate? My heart Turns fondly to thine image. O! where art thou? How spending thy brief widowhood? what work Of patient duty or meek love pursuing? Haply thou watchest, with maternal fondness, The slumbers of our children, or in calm And serious converse with those gentle friends, Whose presence half consoles thee for my absence, Pliest thy busy needle, toiling hard At some great masterpiece of seamstress skill,â Trouser or tiny shirt, or infant frock, Or cap constructed to set off the smiles Of dimpled babyhood;âmeanwhile to lighten The evening's toil, one reads, with placid tone, Some volume of grave truth or pleasant fiction, Whereto with serious and attentive ear Well pleased thou listenest, though at times thy thoughts, Spite of thyself, wander away to him Who, on his part, in solitude remote, Is wedding his fond thoughts of thee and home To these weak, worthless numbers. Peace be with thee, My gentle love, whate'er thy occupation, Where'er thy thoughts are fix'd; such peace as thou, By all the arts of wedded tenderness Hast breathed into this wild and wayward spirit. For thou hast been to me a guiding star, My tutelary genius, my good angel, The ministering spirit, by whose hand The Giver of all good hath lavish'd on me His choicest bounties. Thou canst never know How much I owe thee for whate'er of good Is mingled with this gross and selfish nature; For what I am, or may beâand no less For that which I am not; for, without thee, And that sweet exercise of pure affectionsâ Those moods of sober thought and tender musing,â That calm fulfilment of unquiet hopes And fiery longings after happiness, Which thou alone hast yielded or couldst yield meâ I had remain'd the wild, impetuous slave Of uncontroll'd self will, made weak and wretched By foul perversion of the choicest gifts Shower'd on me by all-bounteous Providence. And if, reclaim'd from wanderings manifold, And made partaker of a better hope And purer aspirations, I now walk, Though with unsteady and irresolute step, In the straight path which leads to life eternal, To thee, in part, I owe it. Be all praise To Him whose grace, by means inscrutable, Hath won us from this world of sense and sin To prospects bright of immortality! Therefore, O gentlest, our connubial love, Hallow'd by strong consent of mutual faith And kindred aspirations, hath assumed A nobler character; for we two walk Through this life's strange and ever varying road, Not as chance wayfarers, ere long to part At Death's grim hostelâbut as deathless souls Inseparably join'd, and doom'd to share Each other's company through endless changes Of still progressive being:âand shall we, Thus strongly bound by chains indissoluble, Heirs of one blessed hope, leagued in pursuit Of one immortal prizeâshall we not share Each other's joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, In tenderest sympathy? shall we not bear Each other's burdens, cheer each other's toils, And, in most loving emulation, strive Which shall do most to help the other's welfare In this world and the next? My Margaret, Methinks when I look back on our past years Of wedded life, much seems to be amiss On my partâsomewhat haply e'en on thine; For this, whatever may have been my share In our joint list of treasons conjugal, For rash impatience, tempers unsubdued, And much neglect of duties manifold, Would I now crave forgiveness, and henceforth Resolve, by powerful help of grace divine, To act, more perfectly, the Christian husband. Henceforth let us two live, in full discharge Of all those gentle duties which we owe Each to the other, as souls knit together In bonds divine, and emblematical Of that most holy and mysterious union Wherein the Church is join'd to its great Head;â Beloved and loving, cherishing and cherish'd. And let no cold distrust, on either part, Mar or obstruct the full and perfect freedom Wherewith in turn we render, each to each, Our debts of mutual service, faithful counsel, Gentle admonishment, well-timed reproof, And solace mild, and cheering exhortation. Nor let us lack congenial partnership Of thought and study, intermingling oft, As time permits, with books of sacred lore And serious meditation, hastier snatches Of fiction wild and wizard phantasy. So may our hearts be strengthen'd and refresh'd For due discharge of this world's sterner duties; For self-denying acts of meek good will Toward all men;âchiefly those whom Heaven's high counsel Hath placed within our own peculiar charge, Linking their lot to ours in one close bond Of Christian fellowship and pastoral care. But, holier far than all, more closely blended With all our heart's most pure and sacred feelings,â That task, so wholly ours, to form the minds Of our sweet children;âso to train them up, That, after this world's brief and bustling journey, We all may meet where sorrow is no more, But God shall wipe the tears from all our eyes. O here it is, in the exact fulfilment Of this most solemn duty, that thy worth Appears most brightly; here I recognize, With love and admiration most profound, The rich array of choicest qualities Which grace thy wedded character, and fit thee As fully for the mother as the wife. Affection deep and fervent, yet controll'd By principle severe;âdecisive firmness, And patience most long-suffering;âprudence mild, And skill to guide and govern their young hearts By gentle yet resistless impulses To meek obedience and submission calm. O, if 'tis written in high Heaven's decrees That both of us must not behold them come To life's maturityâmayst thou survive To guide their progress thither; for so best Shall our fond hopes and prayers be realized By final union in the world to come. But finish'd is my exile;âI return Homeward with eager heart, most glad once more To seize my pastoral staff, and so exchange The wild and wandering visions of the Muse For ministerial duties, and sweet store Of home enjoyments. May this idle song Find favour in thy sight, as I dare hope It will not fail to find. Receive it, dearest, Indulgently, as doubtless much it needs, Framed as it is with long unpractised skill, And energies decay'd; keep it in memory Of thy fond husband's love, and when 'tis read, Cease to regret that once, at Friendship's call, He left thee and thy children, for awhile To sojourn in the distant Cornish moors; Where, to relieve the strong and passionate yearnings Of his poor widow'd heart, he first devised, And partly framed, this true and tender strain, Begun and ended for no eyes but thine. AN APOLOGY FOR TACITURNITY. I love thee, ladyâoh how wellâ Nor thou canst guess, nor I can tell; But 'tis with such a reverent love As saints feel here for saints above; A love less fond than household ties And sweet domestic sympathies; Less passionate, but purer far Than purest dreams of lovers are;â Such love as felt the Florentine For her, his soul's immortal queen, Who led him, in angelic guise, Through the bright realms of Paradise. For thou, though mortal still I ween, Even such a guide to me hast been; A cheering light, a mission'd star To guide my footsteps from afar, Through mist and fog, through shower and shine, Right heavenward to thy home and mine. Whence comes it then, (if thou canst guess,) That when my heart would fain express The thoughts thy presence makes to flow,â The feelings that within me glow; When I would open my full soul Without reserve, without control, Lay bare to thee each secret part Of this poor, wayward, sinful heart,â And speak with thee, in converse high, Of thoughts that roam beyond the sky,â Of all my hopes,âof all my fears,â Of griefs that âlie too deep for tears,ââ Of doubts that o'er my spirit steal,â Of all I would, but cannot feel,â Of many a dark, rebellious hour, In thought and will, to Heaven's high powerâ Of bitter strife waged hard within,â Of triumphs dark achieved by sinâ When thus I would pour forth to thee My inmost soul's anxiety,â Or when, in less religious mood, I'd talk with thee, if talk I could, On subjects grave of pleasant thought,â In all too happy to be taught By thy pure wisdom, which doth reach The farthest realm of thought and speech, And make all lovelyâtell me why This spell-bound tongue so dumb doth lie? Why is it that thy speaking eye, Which smiles upon me with intent To give serene encouragement,â And thy sweet words, which fain would break My spirit's charm, and gently wake My slumbering speech to converse high, By sense of mutual sympathyâ Why do these serve to tighten more The chain which was so tight before? Why doth each sweet attempt of thine To give me freedom, only twine A heavier, stronger spell around me Than that with which my nature bound me? Why, when my heart is yearning still Of fervent talk to take its fill, Doth want of power so fetter will, That half in fear, and half in joy, I falter like a frighten'd boy, And stammer forth, in hurried tone, A few faint, scatter'd words alone;â Unmeaning words of vain assent, Or more unmeaning sentimentâ Betokening thought confused and dim,â Ideas indistinct, that swim In shapeless masses, undefined And dreamlike, through my labouring mind; And feelings which, though proud to feel, I neither dare nor can reveal? It is not fearâit is not love, Which so my charmed soul doth move, That I must oft appear to thee Senseless or passionless to be. O lady! 'tis a dread respect Of thy majestic intellect; A sense of awe which makes me bow Before thy voice, before thy brow, In reverence for that depth of mind So richly stored, so disciplined To the full use of all its powers, By patient thought and studious hours; And, more than this, a consciousness, Too deep for language to express, Of that most perfect holiness Which God himself in thee hath wrought Through years of calm religious thought,â Through study deep and constant prayer,â Through trials darkâthrough grief and care, Through contemplation pure and highâ Through many a well won victory, With toil and pain, achieved o'er sinâ Enfranchising the depths within From all dominion but his own, And slowly building up a throne In thy pure soul, whereon he may Himself reign paramount for aye. 'Tis true, elsewhere I may have found Minds as exact, nor less profound; And haply some, in many years, Almost in holiness thy peers; But never, never found I one In whom thy wit and wisdom shone So chasten'd as they are in thee By fervent Christianity; Thy reason calmâthy faith intenseâ Thy clear and bright intelligence; And all this with a woman's heart, Framed perfectly in every part, And rich in sympathies of earthâ The love that gladdens home and hearthâ The prudence mildâthe sense discreetâ The household smile so bright and sweetâ The sweeter tears, so prompt to flow, Not for thine own but others' woe; The grace which clothes in fairest dress All this thine other loveliness; In voice and look, in mind and heart, Lady, how beautiful thou art! And I,âshould not this soul of mine Feel, as it doth, rebuked by thine? This soul, which howsoe'er endued With capabilities of goodâ With powers of thought, and feeling high, And some bright gleams of phantasy,â Did, in the morn of life's brief day, Cast all its better gifts away; Waste half its brightest years on earth In cares and pleasures little worth; Leaving itself untutor'd still,â Unpurified from moral illâ Unfurnish'd with the needful store Of earthly or of heavenly lore;â Its headstrong passions unsubduedâ Its carnal spirit unrenew'd; Each talent unimproved, or given To things on earth, not things in heaven? Myself the slave, the creature still Of self-indulgence and blind will? O lady, look not at my heart; For, all benignant as thou art, Thou couldst not choose but love me less, Couldst thou behold, or know, or guess Its yet too great unworthiness. And wilt thou love me less? Ah me! That I should thus conceive of thee! That such a thought should e'er have birth As that of losing, here on earth, Thy friendshipâthe best boon, but one, I yet retain beneath the sun! No, lady, I can ne'er believe But that howe'er thy soul may grieve Over my many faults, thou still Wilt yield me, of thine own sweet will, Affection unreserved, but kind, And with remembrances entwined Dear, though most sad, of recent ties, Close knit by mutual sympathies, And sorrows, in which thou and I Wept and consoled alternately. Forgive me, then, that I so oft Hear thy dear voice, so sweet and soft, Provoking me by gentlest force To intellectual discourse; Yet sit, as seems, regardless by, In helpless taciturnity. Think of me, as of one whose seat Should be for ever at thy feet; As one who fain would learn of thee, In most sincere humilityâ Yea, like a meek and docile childâ Religion pure and undefiled;â As one whom God to thee hath given, A friend to be prepared for Heaven. TO MARGARET IN HEAVEN. I. I loved thee not, I knew thee not, I never heard thy name, Till they told me that thy spirit pure had left its mortal frame; Thy voice, thy smile, thy pleasant ways can never be to me The treasures, which they are to some, of mournful memory: When I gaze into the throng'd abyss of youth's departed years, Amidst the forms, that meet me there, no trace of thee appears; And if I strive to picture thee to Fancy's inward eye, I see indeed a shadowy dream of beauty flitting by; A thoughtful brow, a look lit up by faith and love divine,â But not the true, the mortal brow, the look that once was thine. II. And shalt thou then depart from earth, and take thy shining place Among the brightest daughters of our lost and ransom'd race, Without one passing thought from me, one feeling of regret Unfelt for other Christian saints whose eyes and mine ne'er met? Shall I hear of all thy patient pangs, thy meekly yielded breath, Yet think of theeâas merely one who died a Christian death?â Undistinguish'd in my mental eye, from all the sainted dead Whose souls the spirit cleansed from sin, for whom the Saviour bled? And, if we meet hereafter, in the mansions of the blest Shall I then, by no assured mark, discern thee from the rest? III. Not so; we two are strangers,âwe were never friends on earth; We never slept beneath one roof, nor sate beside one hearth. And yet, methinks, we are not strange,âso many chains there be Which seem to weave a viewless band between my soul and thee. Sweet sister of my early friend, the kind, the single-hearted, Than whose remembrance none more bright still gilds the days departed; Beloved, with more than sister's love, by some whose love to me Is now almost my brightest gem in this world's treasuryâ Shall I not love thee, sainted one, to whom such love was given? Shall I not mourn thy loss on earth, yet hail thy flight to Heaven? IV. Thy grave is wet with bitter tears from eyes whose friendly smile Hath power to cheer my sinking heart, my heaviest cares beguile; The cordial tones and kindly looks, which gladden me and mine, Oft smiled and sounded pleasantly in unison with thine: And should it be God's holy will that we their graves should see, Our tears will flow as fast for them as theirs have flow'd for thee. Thou must not be estranged from usâwe too must share thy love; We claim thee for our spirit friend, our sister saint above. Where'er thy present home may be, whate'er thy present bliss, We call thee, from thine own bright world, to smile on us in this. V. If blessed souls may wander from the region of their rest,â If thou watchest still the infant's sleep who lately drain'd thy breast,â If still around the nuptial bed thy phantom footsteps glide,â If still thou walk'st invisible by thy saintly parent's side,â We bid theeâwilt thou hear usâfrom the haunts thou hold'st so dear, To join awhile our fireside group, and view our friendly cheer. Hover near us, in thy holiness,âsmile sweet on home and hearth, Let thy unseen presence soothe our woes and sanctify our mirth; So may we with thy spirit hold communion calm and high, Till we follow thee, by Jesu's grace, to thy home beyond the sky. STANZAS WRITTEN IN A SICK ROOM BEFORE DAWN, January 8, 1835. I At length they slumber sweetly,â The mother and her child; And all their pains completely Are now to rest beguiled. Thank God, who to our prayers Hath sent this blest reply, To soothe awhile my anxious cares, And calm my wakeful eye. II Our maid, with watching weary, To late repose is gone; And, in this chamber dreary, I sit and muse alone. O joy! that, for a space, My heart to muse is free From my sweet boy's imploring face, And moans of agony. III And joy! that his dear mother, Beside him close reclined, Doth in oblivion smother The sorrows of her mind; And that her body's pangs, Which she so meekly bore, Relax awhile their piercing fangs, And vex her frame no more. IV Who would not share my anguish, To see that suffering pair Condemn'd to pine and languish In pain and sickness there? Two gentle souls, like those, So pure from guilt within, Doom'd haply to these bitter woes For my unpardon'd sin? V For oh! in this dark season, What tales doth conscience tell! How doth awaken'd reason Reveal the bosom's hell! What shapes before me start, Too frightful to express, Of sins long cherish'd in my heart, And old unfaithfulness! VI Full many a wild transgression, In reckless boyhood wrought, Comes forth to make confession In this sad hour of thought; And headstrong courses run, Through paths of vice and wrong; And deeds not done, which should be done, And talents buried long. VII They stand reveal'd before me,â A black and hideous crowd; And wail dire warnings o'er me, And threatenings deep and loud. The sensual days of youth, And manhood's sloth are there; And service slack perform'd to truth, And much neglect of prayer. VIII Ah! little think my neighbours How weak a thing is he, Who thus among them labours With pastoral ministry: They know not, when they hear My speech so blunt and bold, How oft my heart, with doubt and fear, Is comfortless and cold. IX And is it then to chasten These grievous faults in me, That pain and sickness fasten Their fangs, my child, on thee? Is it for sins of mine, My own beloved wife, That all these fiery pangs of thine Embitter thy dear life? X Oh, then, with deep repentance Let me avert the blow, And disannul the sentence Which dooms my house to woe. Let tears of contrite love My soul's pollution wash, And more devout obedience prove How I have felt the lash. XI It may be God will hear me, With loving mercy mild, And send sweet hope to cheer me For thee and for our child. I felt his hand just nowâ Methought its heat was gone, And on his late so feverish brow A blessed moisture shone. XII He utter'd not, at waking, Those piteous cries of pain; His head's perpetual aching Hath sunk to rest again. And thou art slumbering stillâ I hear thee breathing deep; God save thee from all threaten'd ill By this refreshing sleep! XIII Two sufferers meek and lowly Have ye together been; Thy heart, with patience holy And humble faith, serene: His pains so sweetly borne Could ne'er have been, I guess, Had God not soothed his heart forlorn With his own tenderness. XIV The dawn at length is breaking In yon clear, frosty skies; Our servants now are shaking The slumber from their eyes. O may the coming day Bring health and peace to you, And summon me stern duty's way More straightly to pursue. DIRGE, SUGGESTED IN SLEEP. I Away! away! away! This earth's no longer gay; For our child lies dead In his grass-grown bedâ Shall we lie there too? O yea! II Away! away! away! All things look old and grey; There's nought below But death and woeâ Shall we love this world? O nay! III Away! away! away! Heaven's fields are bright and gay; And our child dwells there In the brightest airâ Shall we follow him thither? O yea! IV Away! away! away! Though rugged and steep's the way, Our child looks down In his sunbright crownâ Shall he look in vain? O nay! V Away! away! away! In the grave where Jesus layâ Where our child lies now,â Shall I and thou Sleep sound, sweet love? O yea! VI Away! away! away! To the realms of eternal day; Our path we must win Against sorrow and sinâ Shall we falter or faint? O nay! FAREWELL TO HERNE BAY. WRITTEN AT THE MOMENT OF DEPARTURE. I Away! away! away! Through the dancing waves and spray Like light we glide With wind and tideâ Farewell to fair Herne Bay! II Away! away! away! We'll greet thee as we may; Though we found thee glad, And we leave thee sad, Thou'rt dear to us, Herne Bay. III Away! away! away! O! little we thought, that day When we near'd thy shore, That we now, but four Out of five, should leave Herne Bay. IV Away! away! away! When the grass grows green and gay On our infant's grave, O'er the swift sea wave, We'll seek thee again, Herne Bay. V Away! away! away! A treasure we leave for aye, Which shall mark a track For our fond hearts back To thee and to thine, Herne Bay. VI Away! away! away! Let's weep no more, but pray That each aching breast Of us four may rest As the fifth rests in Herne Bay. STANZAS. I Was this too needed? must even thou, So firm in faith, so meek of heart, So chasten'd by long suffering, bow Once more beneath a bitterer smart Than earth's worst sorrows can impart To any unregenerate soul? Must thou, enfranchised as thou art, So nearly, from sin's dark control, Still bleed beneath the stripes which make us sinners whole? II I thought (ah vain and selfish thought!) That all thy chastisements were o'er; For that thy heart had now been taught Christ's hardest lesson, and no more Should ache as it hath ached of yore: And 'twas a dear delight to me To hope that, as Life's daylight wore, Thy sky grew clear, and I should see Thy sun, without a cloud, go down rejoicingly. III I hoped for years serene and calm, Still calmer as their close drew nigh; In which thy soul should breathe the balm Of Heaven's profoundest peace, while I, Sharing that deep tranquillity, Should dwell near thy beloved side, And learn thy wisdom pure and high, And how thy earlier faith was tried, And how thy soul had been, through suffering, sanctified. IV I knew that in thy bosom dwelt A silent grief, a hidden fear, A sting which could be only felt By spirits to their God most dear! Which yet thou felt'st, from year to year, Unsoften'd, nay embitter'd still; And many a secret sigh and tear Heaved thy sad heart, thine eyes did fill, And anxious thoughts thou hadst presaging direst ill. V My prayers (ah! why so cold and few?) Were that this weight might be removed; And that thy living eyes might view All they desired in all they loved; But when imagination roved Through dreams of sorrow, which might be, My dull, blind heart was never moved, Even by the thought that thou shouldst see Of this thy bitterest fear the dread reality. VI And now thou bleed'st beneath the blowâ The blow I deem'd too sharp to fallâ Ah! how shall I assuage thy woe? What flow'rets scatter o'er the pall Of earthly Hope's sad funeral? Alas! I cannot rend the sky, Nor streams of light celestial call To burst the gloom which clouds the eye E'en of thy faith, and wraps Heaven's self in mystery. VII I cannotânor, alas! canst thou; Although no dearer child hath He Who grieves thy saintly spirit now With this most dread severity; Nor suffers thee as yet to see Deliverance from heart-crushing woes; Yet mayst thou to His bosom flee, To Him thy secret soul disclose, And in his long-tried love thy perfect trust repose. VIII Thou dostâah! well I know thou dostâ I know thy heart was all in heaven, To earth and earth's delusions lost, To God and Christ completely given, Ere yet by this last stroke 'twas riven: Long hast thou dwelt with us on earth, A spirit purged from earthly leaven, Still sharing all our grief and mirth, Half angel though thou art, God's child by second birth. IX Thy pangs, which now pierce soul and sense, No child of this world e'er hath known; And shall these earn no recompense From Him whom they proclaim thine ownâ The heir of Heaven's eternal throne? Oh think not he can aught decree Not breathing tenderest love alone, And final bliss, to thine and theeâ Aught that could mar in heaven thy full felicity. X In heaven?âand must I think of Earth? Ah! dearest friendâthy fading browâ Thy failing strengthâthis new-sent dearth Of hope, which makes thy firm heart bow! Have I no cause to tremble now? And yetâshame on my selfish fearsâ Shame that such fears I should avowâ Why grieve to think thy mortal years Were number'd, thy work done in this our world of tears? XI I will not;âyet I mustâI must; For what, alas! were I and mine, When we had given thee back to dust; When all that tenderness of thine, Thy wisdom pure, thy faith divine, Had vanish'd from our earthly store? When thy deep heart's exhaustless mine Should yield us its rich gems no more, And all our loving talk, our pleasant days be o'er? XII I may not think on griefs like these;â Yet, yet, beloved friend, remain; If earthly love hath power to ease The pressure of thy grievous pain, And cheer thy chasten'd heart again; Still let us minister to thee, Nor haply minister in vain, Whate'er of tenderest aid may be, Whate'er of comfort yet, in all love's treasury. XIII Stay with us till our hearts are strong; Till we can gaze, with steadier eye, To where, amidst the saintliest throng, Thy spirit shall be throned on high: Stay till we too are fit to die,â Christ's messenger to us and ours; Teach us to share thy victory O'er lust and sin's rebellious powers, And lead our steps, with thine, to Heaven's unfading bowers. TO MARION. I Thanks, Marion, for thy sojourn brief In this our English home; Source, as it is, of present grief, But joy for years to come; Of grief, that we must part to-day, Of joy, that thou, when far away Beyond the ocean foam, Wilt leave, on mine and Margaret's heart, An image fair of what thou art. II To her, or ere thy face we knew, A cherish'd dream wast thou; The tints her fancy o'er it threw Have scarcely faded now: But fancy's touch hath slender skill The heart's desiring void to fill, Or airy shapes endow Of the unseen we pant to see, With life and warm reality. III Hadst thou been coarse of form and mien, Or base of mind and heart, Small comfort it perchance had been To know thee as thou art. Then she and I might both have grieved That our own visions, half believed, For ever must depart Before one disenchanting glance Of thy long look'd for countenance. IV But we have seen thee;âseen the mind That lights thy full, dark eye; Enjoy'd thy feelings warm and kind, Thy spirit clear and high; Have follow'd thee through thought's wide range, With many a cordial interchange Of mutual sympathy; And seen thee tread the paths of life, The friend, the mother, and the wife. V Henceforth there dwells in either heart A form of flesh and blood, Not shaped by fancy's treacherous art, But known and understood: No frail creation of the thought, From frail materials feebly wrought, In some fantastic mood; But one whose real traits express Distinct and breathing loveliness. VI Thanks for thy visit; thanks for all Which thou wilt leave behind; The light that on our hearts will fall From thy reflected mind; The frank good will, the generous love, The frequent thought on things above, The speech sincere, but kind, The humour gay, the sportive mirth, The laugh that gladdens home and hearth. VII Thanks for all these:âwe know not how Their worth is prized elsewhere; But here our grateful hearts avow That thou art good and fair. And here thy memory still shall dwell, A pleasant thought, a soothing spell To blunt the stings of care; Thy substitute, when thou art gone, For friendly thought to rest upon. VIII And thouâwhen thou once more shalt see Thy home in hot Bengal, Shall no remembrance cleave to thee Of us, of ours, of all The friends whom here we love so well, The quiet haunts in which we dwell, The interests, great and small, The tranquil pleasures, cares and ways Which fill the English pastor's days? IX Take with thee, Marion, thoughts like these To cheer thy Indian home, And give thy burthen'd spirit ease When grief and care shall come. Go, tell our friends, who linger there, Our fields are pleasant as they were Ere they began to roam; Tell them that, come when come they will, They'll find our hearts unalter'd still. X Nor worthless, nor by them unfelt Such words from us will be; Nor slow, perchance, their hearts to melt When they shall speak with thee Still fresh from calm familiar talk, From fireside laugh and evening walk With my sweet wife and me; Thy voice a breeze from happier climes, Breathing old thoughts, old joys, old times. XI There's one who soothed us here erewhile In days of care and pain, With the sweet sunshine of her smileâ Our own beloved Jane. Her gentle heart 'twill surely stir, To think that here thou'st roam'd like her, And lain where she hath lain; Hast track'd the paths her footsteps press'd, And shared, like her, our household rest. XII High intercourse methinks should be Between her soul and thine, And store of mutual sympathy In thoughts and cares divine. With open heart and serious speech May ye take council, each with each, From Truth's exhaustless mine Extracting treasures richer far Than those of eastern monarchs are. XIII We know not if in after years We e'er may meet again; Nor whether, then, in smiles or tears, In pleasure or in pain: But this we know, that whatsoe'er The burthen each may have to bear, 'Twill not be borne in vain, If so our sever'd souls may be Prepared for immortality. XIV Farewell! mayst thou, in yon dark land, Thy hard course shape aright, And shed o'er that fraternal band Thy spirit's inner light; Stern duty's arduous course pursue, Thy human will, thyself subdue By faith's all-conquering might; And meet us, when life's toil is done, The good fight fought, the victory won. TO SYLVIA. I Maiden, on thy vaunted beauty Never yet mine eye hath fed; But, between young love and duty, Thou, I know, art sore bested. Love indeed hath been to thee No vain trick of phantasy. II Haply childhood's visions told thee He was mild, and bland, and fair; Would, with soft embrace, enfold thee From the touch of pain and care; Strew thy path with brightest flowers, Twine above thee myrtle bowers. III Such, in Eden's blissful valleys, Love perchance might still have been, Had not hell's triumphant malice Marr'd his sweetness, dimm'd his sheen; Such doth Fancy paint him still To the longing heart and will. IV Tell us, maiden, hast thou found him Thus delicious, thus divine? Doth such witchery breathe around him? Is his spirit so benign? Doth he shed, o'er heart and brain, More of pleasure or of pain? V Dreams there be of brain-sick passion, Sentimental groan and sigh, Heart-aches aped for very fashion,â Of such whimsies ask not I: Let them trouble fops and fools, Reign supreme o'er boarding-schools. VI But with fiercer pain and anguish Love like thine must oft contend; Oft the breaking heart must languish Till, with life, its sorrows end. Well our Shakspere spake, in sooth, âTrue love's course did ne'er run smooth.â VII Mammon spreads his glittering treasures To entrap parental eyes; Laughs to scorn our purest pleasures, Revels in our tears and sighs. How should true love flourish here, In this earth's chill atmosphere? VIII Hard thy task;âyet meet it, maiden, With a true and steadfast will, Though thy heart, with care o'erladen, Faint beneath the burden still. Through thy worst temptations prove Firm in duty, firm in love. IX Better 'twere to wither slowly On the lonely virgin stalk, Than, fast bound in ties unholy, Through a desert world to walk, Dragging still, with toil and pain, Sordid Mammon's golden chain. X Better far that maids should sprinkle Flowers upon thy virgin grave, When the star-beams faintly twinkle, And the moon is on the wave, Than thy brow with wreaths adorn For a loveless bridal morn. XI Better go a saint unspotted, To thy glorious home above, Than, by this world's gauds besotted, Lose for ever life and love; Throned in empty state and show, Empress of a world of woe. XII Yet, perchance, at length victorious O'er this danger and distress, We shall hail thy triumph glorious With loud songs of happiness; Lead thee home in bridal pomp, With the sound of harp and trump; XIII Come, with shouting, forth to meet thee, Wife and husband, sire and son; As our new-found sister greet thee, Boldly woo'd and nobly won. Meet rejoicings then shall be In our festive family. XIV Keep thy love, a guarded treasure In thine inmost heart laid by; All its pain and all its pleasure Shall thy spirit purify; If thou rein wild fancy still With a firm and temperate will. XV Murmur not;âbethink thee rather, When these pangs thy patience try, That thou hast another Father In thy home above the sky. When thine eyes with tears grow dim, Turn them patiently to Him. XVI Welcome His consoling Spirit, Then, whate'er thy mortal doom, Doubt not that thou shalt inherit Endless bliss beyond the tomb: Where, redeem'd from earthly thrall, Heavenly love is all in all. ELEGIAC STANZAS. I They say that, since I wander'd last Amidst my childhood's haunts and bowers, A spirit to the skies hath past From these romantic vales of ours, For whom all gentle hearts make moan, Each feeling all the loss its own. II And I, they say, must not withhold A funeral chaplet from her bier; For that her love was shared of old By many to my memory dear; And that, in youth, there fell on me Some flashes of her brilliancy. III They bid me think on days long past, When first that gentle face I knew, Whose lineaments are fading fast In dark decay's sepulchral hue; They tell me of her graceful form, Where banquets now the hungry worm. IV And they remind me of her voice, And of her magic minstrel skill, Whose music made e'en grief rejoiceâ But those rich notes are vocal still; Blending their sweetness with the hymn Of Heaven's melodious seraphim. V They tell me that her heart was kind And pure as hearts of angels be; They tell me thought enrich'd her mind,â And I believed them; though to me What matters now its richest worth, Since she's in Heaven, and I on earth? VI They tell me that, in later years, Her hopes were all with Christ in Heaven? That she had wash'd her heart in tears, And felt sweet peace for sins forgiven. I doubt them not; would God that I Could thus to Time's poor trifles die! VII So she is in her earthy bed,â Her place in this world's void for aye; She rests among the saintly dead, Asleep until the judgment day; And they, who loved her, vainly long For her sweet looks, and words, and song. VIII They look and long: beside their hearth They listen for her voice in vain; By day or night, in grief or mirth, They may not hear its tones again: With craving heart, and aching eye, They seek her still unconsciously. IX And there are reliques, fair though few, Which of her sweetness she hath left; The forms her fairy pencil drew, The garden of her care bereft; The children, who as dear had grown, To her, as they had been her own. X And poor men weep upon her grave For many a blessing now no more; The words she spake, the gifts she gave, The balm her kindness loved to pour Into their bleeding hearts, when care And want, and grief were rankling there. XI And who shall fill her place on earth? And who her mother's tears shall dry? And who relieve her sister's dearth Of love, and bliss, and sympathy? What voice shall summon from the dead The grace and goodness which have fled? XII It may not be; though oft in dreams Perchance her image wanders back, Fair as of old, and trailing gleams Of glory down her earthward track; So visiting the midnight sleep Of eyes that only wake to weep. XIII That wake to weep? to weep for her? The freed from Earthâthe housed in Heaven? Triumphant o'er the sepulchre,â Her sorrows past, her sins forgiven? To weep for her? it must not be; Our tears would blot her victory. XIV Nay, hymn her flight with rapturous songs; For she, in Death's embrace, hath done With human griefs, and fears, and wrongs; Her fight is fought, her triumph won. The amaranth crown is round her brow, She dwells beside her Saviour now. XV Weep not, or weep as those should weep Whose hope is stronger than their sorrow; To-night our loved and lost ones sleep, But Christ will bring them back to-morrow. We shall not long lament them here, Our home is in a brighter sphere. FAMILIAR EPISTLES. NO. I. TO A FEMALE FRIEND. Lady, whose sojourn in our simple town Hath been an angel's visit, showering down, From the far regions of its own bright skies, Streams of pure love, and kindliest sympathies; O lady, whom most fain would I address With all St. John's pastoral tenderness, Beseeching thee that we might love each other, For the truth's sake, like sister and like brother. (Or if a holier name than these there be In Christian Friendship's phraseology, Would, lady, such might serve for thee and me,) If our past year of intercourse (most sweet To me and mine) allow itâI entreat Bear with me while I weave thee a rough song, (For verse and I have lost each other long) Of friendliest thoughts and feelings, such, in sooth, As, scarce experienced in my prime of youth, I little deem'd would e'er have glow'd again In this worn heart and care-encumber'd brain. Thanks to thee, friend revered, for thus revealing These unsuspected springs of blissful feeling! These deep, rich veins of comfort pure and high, This growth of fresh and fervent sympathy; These treasures of affection, long unknown, Till the sweet sunbeams of thy friendship shone Into my spirit's depths, and brought to light A world of pleasures new and exquisite. O! untold thanks to thee, that thou hast shown What, but for thee, I haply ne'er had known In its most bright and captivating dressâ The perfect beauty of true holiness, With every sweet accomplishment combined Of female grace, and more than female mind. Thanks for the knowledge thou so well hast taught, That 'tis not only youth's impassion'd thought, And glowing fancy, which makes this world bright, Gilding each object with unreal light, And making us discern, in all we view, Worth so transcendent if it were but true; Till the fond heart, too frequently deceived, Suspects all goodness, which it once believed, E'en like the apples on the Dead Sea shore, Goodly without, but ashes at the core. From such drear thoughts by thee for ever freed, And taught a nobler and more cheerful creed,â Taught to perceive, with Reason's sober eye, A loveliness unknown to phantasy, To know, by ripe experience, that our earth Possesses treasures of sublimer worth Than young imagination e'er conceived, Or faith, unpractised in the world, believed; How gladly may I welcome middle age! How cheerily pursue my pilgrimage, Secure that nought can wholly darken life, While thou'rt my friend, andâthou know'st who, my wife. Call not this flattery, deeply valued friend;â I fear thou wilt; yet could invention lend Words still more fervent, all too cold would be To speak the gratitude I owe to thee For the last year's rich blessings. But no more, Lest I should pain thee, while thy heart, still sore From recent grief, shrinks sadlier than before From praise. I know that death hath been a guest By the fireside of some whom thou lov'dst best Of many who love thee; that anxious fears, Too soon succeeded by swift gushing tears And funeral laments, have been the lot Of thy sweet household; yet I mock thee not With wailings for the dead; for she rests wellâ Asleep in Jesus, safe from the rough swell Of this world's troubled and tempestuous sea, In the calm haven where we all would be. Nor will I grieve for thee, in whose tried soul Faith hath her perfect work, and doth control The tides of passion nobly. Life for thee Hath lost some part of its anxiety: Thy heart hath been sore chasten'd, and no more Shall ache, as it hath ached in days of yore, At the drear touch of sorrow; thy worst woe Hath been endured long since, and nought below Henceforth shall move thee from thy perfect trust, Till thine own body shall return to dust, Thy soul to its Creator. Death hath given By this last blow one treasure more to Heaven, Snapp'd one more bond which held thee down to earth, And all condolence would be little worth To one whose conversation is, like thine, Ever more nearly among things divine. But there's another dear to me and thee, Thine own bright L?, oh! how fareth she In this sad wreck of love, beneath this stroke Of Heaven's own lightning, which at once hath broke Friendship's strong bonds, worn through so many years, And strengthen'd in the wearing: are her tears Yet dry, or does their flowing bring relief To that absorbing and most passionate grief, Which only hearts like hers, of finest mould, Feel as she feels it? Ere that grief grows old, May He who sent it, and doth never send A causeless sorrow, shape it to that end For which I know thy constant prayers ascend To His eternal presence; may that mind So proudly gifted, and e'en now inclined To all things lovely, noble, pure and good, Be, by this heart-stroke, to His will subdued, And fix'd on things above. Now let me greet The second daughter of thy love, my sweet And pensive-hearted M?. Hath she grown In grace and spiritual beauty, shown In her most gentle and heart-winning ways? In that retiring meekness, which to praise Were to insult it? in that quiet love To things on earth, but more to things above? In those mild eyes, serene as summer even, Which speak of frequent communings with Heaven? In the sweet zeal with which she doth explore The fountains, deep and vast, of sacred lore, To drink of Truth's pure stream? Tell her, from me, The record of her last year's industry Now lies upon my table; whereon I Pore ever and anon with critic eye, Which yet finds nought to blame, but much to praise. Yet haply make the path which must be trod By my own footsteps heavenward, more secure, By dint of guiding youthful souls and pure Up to their home and mine. Shall I forget Mirthful E?, or disclaim my debt Of kind remembrances to her? Not soâ Most gladly let me pay her that I owe; Thanks for her childhood's friendship, a sweet boon Made up of pure affections, which too soon Our cold world will sophisticate, unless Thy most discreet maternal tenderness, Aided and blest by guidance from above, Preserve the spring untainted;âmay such prove The crown of thy endeavours, and may she Enjoy, while yet she can, the fancy-free And happy days of childhoodâhappier still To have the wanderings of her human will Check'd by a Christian mother. But how fares The grave-eyed E?? Academic cares Prove not, I trust, too heavy for his frail And spirit-wasted strength. Is he still pale From studious nights and days of contest high, Struggling for hard and doubtful victory. With his well-match'd compeers! Success attend His struggles, and mayst thou, high-hearted friend, Be well repaid for all thy pious care Of his past years, reaping a harvest fair Of hopes fulfill'd in him. Now wouldst thou learn Somewhat of me and mine? The bay of Herne, Hard by the towers of Canterbury old, Doth, with its huge and shingly arms, enfold Her whom reluctantly I spare from mine; There she disporteth in the amorous brine,â A mixture (pleasant as such mixtures be) Of seaweed and Thames mud, miscall'd âthe Sea,â Wherein brave Maggie and her children three, Her mother and two sisters, brave as she, Plunge like so many mermaids merrily. Heaven send the strength she needs (thou too wilt share, Dear friend, in this my oft repeated prayer), And give her to her household cares again, Such as we both would have her, from all pain And weakness quite deliver'd. For myself I wander here, a melancholy elf, 'Mid the sweet scenes in which my childhood roved, Smiled on by many faces, long beloved, Though now sore alter'd by the touch of years; Yet lovelier far each well known spot appears E'en than it did in youth; I know not why, Unless perhance, that childhood's artless eye, Familiarized too soon to scenes like these, Saw not what now my riper manhood sees, Nor my heart felt what now it deeply feels In Nature's loveliest forms. But sadness steals O'er my poor heart, to find itself alone Where least 'twould be so; where each rock and stone, Green hill and gurgling stream, and stately tree, Seem to demand, âThy loved one, where is she? Where the sweet pledges of her love to thee?â Alas that 'tis so! that these weeks of rest 'Midst scenes and places which should cheer me best, Should find me a lone widower. Yet so High Heaven hath will'd; and hence the thoughts that flow From heart to heart, the feelings that are sent To gladden wedlock, must find other vent, Best found, by me, in verse; therefore do I Weave my thin woof of flimsy phantasy (Poor substitute for sober household bliss, And store of wedded joys) in strains like this, Bidding thought wander to each distant scene Of pleasure yet to be, or which hath been. Therefore my present poverty I cheer By reckoning up the treasures rich and dear Which I possess elsewhere, and (best of all) Think of thy friendship, lady, and recall Thy virtues and thy kindnesses;âbut now 'Tis time to rest this weary heart and brow On my lone couch: all guardian angels dwell With thee and thine for everâso farewell. NO. II. TO THE REV. DERWENT COLERIDGE. For many a year, old friend, since thou and I Dream'd our young dreams of twin-born poesy, And wandering, arm in arm, Cam's banks along, Held our wild talk, and framed our wayward song, My stream of verse, as thou full well dost know, If not dried up, at least hath ceased to flow: Scarce, I believe, for other cause than this, That my whole life hath been so full of bliss, So rich in wedded and domestic love, That the full heart hath had no will to rove From the calm daylight of life's real sphere Into the world of dreams. Year follow'd year, In one scarce varied, yet unwearying round Of undisturb'd enjoyment; still I found The present more unclouded than the past, And almost deem'd joy's increase thus would last, Endless and still progressive. Why should I Quit this fair world, and all its imagery, For the unreal and unblest domain Of shadowy fancy? why invoke again My passionate Muse? why crowd this world-worn brain With unaccustom'd visions, far less bright Than the loved objects of my waking sight; Exchanging sober certainty of peace For wild unrest? 'Twas well my song should cease, My harp lie mute; but now that Death hath come Across my threshold, and despoil'd my home Of its long virgin bliss, I rove once more Through the dim fields of thought, well known of yore, But long forsaken; summon from my brain The ghosts of dreams which there had buried lain Through my past years of happiness; extend My plumeless wings, and struggle to ascend (With efforts weak indeed, and little worth) From the dim sphere of this perturbed earth To Fancy's wizard realm. Thou'lt hardly guess How swiftly, since yon day of bitterness, My stream of what was once poetic thought Hath flow'd and murmur'd; how this pen hath wrought At the old toil, for years well nigh forgot, While verse, almost without a blur or blot, Starts from its touch unbidden. So I range From bank to bank, culling a garland strange Of many-colour'd flowers,âexplore the mine, Boundless and deep, of Hebrew lore divine,â And fashion some sweet tale, by Moses writ, Into such simple rhyme as may befit The studies of my nursery; or again Revert, in thought, to our still recent pain, And ere its memory fade (if fade it may), Or all its bitterness hath past away, Note down minutely every pang we felt While Death, (grim inmate,) in our household dwelt; Our griefs and consolations, one and all, Before and since our darling's funeral: Thus treasuring up such thoughts, for after years, As then may fill our eyes with pleasant tears. In these, and tasks like these, do I beguile My leisure hours, and wander many a mile With book and pencil; Gerard at my side, Meanwhile his gallant donkey doth bestride, With questions grave and deep, from time to time, Scattering my thoughts, and spoiling many a rhyme; Which, were his chat less clever or less quaint, Might well provoke ten poets or a saint. Thus by degrees have I laid up a store Of verseâsome eighteen hundred lines or more, In two brief months, yet not encroached at all On pastoral labours or didactical; By strict economy of brains and time Alternating my sermons with my rhyme, And not retrenching half an hour per week Of lecture to my flock, a page of Greek Or Latin to my pupils. So I spend My time (I trust not idly), and now send A sample (not, perchance, first-rate), to thee Of my new manufacture, which will be A voice as from the sepulchre, to tell Of days long past, but still remember'd well, And ne'er to be forgotten; days of youth, And hope, and gladness, and unsullied truth, And rich imagination, which no more Shall visit us in this world, or restore What Time hath taken from us. Yet, my friend, I trust Time borrows less than he doth lend To souls like thine and mine; nor would I now, While recent grief still half o'erclouds my browâ While that, of which my home hath been bereft, Still throws a shade of gloom o'er all that's leftâ Give, if I could, my four and thirty years, With all their cares and sorrows, hopes and fears, For reckless twenty-one:âI'd not exchange For all the ideal beauty, bright and strange, Which fancy painted in the days gone by, My Margaret's thin pale cheek and sunken eye; (For grief, alas! on her hath done its work, And in the depths of that deep heart doth lurk A still consuming trouble;) I'd not give The bliss which in my children's smiles doth liveâ Their prattle, or their sports, for all the joy, (Nay, ten times all) which, when I was a boy, Or wayward stripling, danced before my sight In waking dreams fantastically bright; Though I believe, e'en then, my fondest thought But rarely long'd for, or imagined aught Of bliss more perfect than hath been my share; Which, if 'tis mingled now with grief and care, Why should I marvel, or repine that I Must bear the burdens of mortality,â The ills that flesh is heir to? I believe That God, in mercy, causes me to grieve; And, should the current of my future years Be ruffled with deep sighs, and swoln with tears, Let me reflect how cloudless and serene The spring and summer of my life have been: Yea, and thank God for sending griefs like these, Lest I, like Moab, settle on my lees; And, having preach'd to others, prove one day Myself a miserable castaway. But shall I waste the waters whose wild rush From my heart's rock hath now been made to gush By the sharp stroke of Heaven's afflictive rod? Not so: henceforth let me devote to God Whatever, with that current, may be roll'd; Whether some few pure grains of genuine gold, Such as enrich'd Pactolus' stream of yore, Or haply baser and less brilliant ore; Even such as stains your Cornish streams like blood, Dimming their brightness with metallic mud, And spoiling of its glories many a scene Which, but for them, right beautiful had been; So that we strangers, with offended eye, Loathe the foul brooks, and wish their channel dry. Such, haply, mine may be; for 'twill be fed From depths whose better ore hath perished, Work'd up long since by youthful passion's rage, And manhood's cares, till now, in middle age, A fragment only of what was remains, Scanty and base, and scarcely worth the pains By which it must be wrought; yet, such as 'tis, Henceforth let it be His and only His, Who form'd and who can use it, if He will, Designs by us undreamt of to fulfil, Poor though it be. Nor boots it to regret The loss of my past years to verse, if yet My heart has springs of feeling which may be Wrought into strains of loftier poesy Than I have yet attempted; though, I own, I feel as if my spirit had outgrown Its aptitude for song; as if too late, It sought its wither'd powers to renovate, Shooting forth blossoms on late summer's bough, Which should have bloom'd in spring, and yielded now To autumn's mellow fruitage. Good, my friend, Thy sympathy and counsel quickly lend; And if thou canst (as well thou couldst of old) Assist my struggling spirit to unfold Its latent powers; if thou canst guide aright Its aimless yet and undecided flight, Give me such aid. I challenge thee once more To a renewal of our feats of yore. Let me provoke thee to contention high Of emulative prowess; let us try Whether the paths of life, which now we tread, Yield not wherewith our spirits may be fed For enterprise poetic, and supply Themes not unmeet for loftiest poesy. Methinks our range for fruitful thought is wideâ The church, the cot, the dying saint's bedside, The house of mourning, the glad nuptial morn, The christening, and the death of the first-born; Yea, even the pastoral glance, which peeps within The foul abodes of infamy and sin; The hopes and fears of ministerial fight With souls deep plunged in spiritual night; The triumph rarely, but how richly, won, When guilt and desperation's headstrong son, Whose soul for man or demon ne'er hath quail'd, By strength of cogent argument assail'd, Begins to stoop his helm, retreats and reels Before the Spirit's sword, which now he feels With terror and with pain, unfelt before, Cutting its way into his heart's rough core, And cleaving, with its keen ethereal point, Spirit and soul, the marrow and the joint, Till he is fain the unequal fight to yield, And leave the gospel master of the field. Yea, childlike and submissive, bows his head To Heaven's high will, and follows as he's led, Till his friends find him where disciples meet, Devoutly sitting at his Saviour's feetâ Him whom no force could tame, no fetters bind, Meek and well clothed, and in his perfect mind. Triumphs like these to win and to rehearse Is ours alone. Are such less fit for verse Than battle-fields and bloodshed, wounds and scars, And tears and groans, the pride of mortal wars? Or would we look on Nature's face awhile With eyes which would indulge a sober smile? The world hath aspects, in our pastoral sphere, Meet for such mirth: 'tis ours to see and hear The parish feudâthe vestry's grave debate; And, in our daily walks, to contemplate In poor and rich, in rustic and refined, The freaks and whims of man's mysterious mind In all its varying humours. But 'tis time To check the rovings of this wayward rhyme; And I have much to ask of thine and thee, And somewhat too to tell, which may not be Comprised in such brief space as now remains In this full sheet. Howbeit, if these poor strains Find favour in thy sight, (as I suppose They partly will,) write soon in verse or prose, As likes thee best, give me such sympathy And counsel as thou canst; but let them be Accompanied by news, delay'd too long, Of all thy household; how, amidst the throng Of boarding-house anxieties and cares, The gentle spirit of our Mary fares; How thrives my bright-eyed namesake, thy fair son; What feats of letter'd prowess he hath done; Nor cheat me of the promise, long since given, To tell of Him, whose spirit, now in Heaven, Sees, face to face, the God whom long he sought By patient study and profoundest thought, What I so thirst to hear. Meanwhile our days Yield matter plentiful for thanks and praise To the great Giver of all Good; though now Sorrow and care have drawn o'er either brow A deeper shade than veil'd it heretofore, Ere death had found an entrance through our door. Our course of life thou knew'st of old, but O! Thou know'st not, and 'tis time that thou shouldst know (Thou and thy Mary) what a spring of bliss, Almost too pure for such a world as this, Hath gush'd out unawares within this year, Our joys to brighten, and our griefs to cheer, With sympathy and love intense and deep:â A treasure beyond price, and which to keep All to ourselves, unshared by thee and thine, Seems monstrous. If high faith and love divine, Glowing in hearts by nature's self design'd For all things lovely, noble, pure and kind, And graced by all that may command respect Of female wisdom and fine intellectâ If this afford thee one attraction more Than those in which we were so rich before, Let not the summer months again have fled, And left our parsonage unvisited. Come, Derwent, and come, Mary; come and see How bloom our roses on their parent tree: Come, take sweet counsel with our friends, who here Supply your place, and scarcely seem less dear. Come, and let Derwikin, the bright and wise, Gladden our Gerard's and George William's eyes; That he and they, when we shall be no more, May to each other bear the love we bore; Transmitting to their sons, in after days, The memory of our friendship and our lays. LINES I Live, if ye may, and strike your roots in earth, Poor flowerets of my fancy's second spring; Whose unexpected and spontaneous birth From grief's tear-water'd soil, did lately fling A soothing fragrance o'er my home and hearth, Sadden'd awhile by Death's first visiting. Live, if ye may, and take abiding root, Forerunners, haply, of autumnal fruit. II Feeble, in truth, and fading ye appear; For my mind's garden, once o'erstock'd with flowers, Hath been devote, for many a busy year, To sterner culture, till its laurel bowers, Too long neglected, have grown thin and sere, And the scant labour of these leisure hours May not the fulness of that bloom restore, Which, suffer'd once to fade, revives no more. III I know not of what depth the soil may be By which your growth is nurtured; but I know That, henceforth, never shall it yield for me Such gaudy wildflowers and rank weeds as grow In the parterres of wanton phantasy, But all its poor fertility bestow On holier produceâlays of faith and love, And His great praise who died, and reigns above. IV High theme, and worthy to attune the strings Of seraph harps to symphonies divine; Whereat the angels, folding their bright wings In trance-like silence, should wrapt ears incline To strains which told them of profounder things Than thought of theirs can fathom;âand shall mine Venture beyond them? daring flight, I ween, For grovelling fancy, such as mine hath been. V Twelve years, life's summer, have for ever fled, Bringing strange changes, since the Muse I woo'd, Even then by fits, as whim or wildness led, In many a wayward and capricious mood: And now that youth is o'er, and passion dead, And nature, as I trust, in part subdued; Almost would I forget, the strains I sung In those rash days, when hope and I were young. VI 'Tis true, men praised them; they were fit to please The popular ear; well stored with fancies strange, And quaint conceits, and yet could pass, with ease, From gay to grave, and skilfully exchange Mirth and wild wit for tenderest melodies; So wide and well young phantasy could range; Yet had her flight been tamer, I had now Had less to grieve my heart and cloud my brow. VII My soul had then from self-reproach been free For lawless revellings of uncheck'd thought; For wanton sallies of untimely glee; For errors, half perceived, yet boldly taught; For dogmas crude, and false philosophy; For vain applause by reckless satire bought; For many an idle thought and idler dream, Which seem'd not to me then so vile as now they seem. VIII And may I now redeem, in middle age, The wasted powers and mis-spent days of youth, And, in my wane of fancy, dare to wage High warfare in behalf of deepest truth? Is it too late to consecrate my page To themes of holy love and heavenly ruth? Too late to use aright the powers which Heaven, For deeds of high emprize and steadfast aim, hath given? IX I know not;âin the silent flight of Time Much hath been lost which I can ne'er regain: The freshness and the fervour of life's prime; The buoyant heart, the ever teeming brain; The power to shape things lovely or sublime, And people with bright dreams this world's domain. All these, as life steals on, have pass'd away, Like morn's last stars that fade before the light of day. X For me no more may young imagination The treasures of her shadowy world disclose, With many a wild and wondrous revelation Stealing my spirit from this vale of woes Into those realms of dreamy contemplation Wherein the world-worn heart may find repose From grave reality and vexing care, Breathing awhile sweet draughts of unpolluted air. XI This world, this solid world, hath closed around me Its prison bars and bolts; I could not break, Even if I would, the fetters which have bound me, Nor from my neck its yoke of bondage shake; And yet 'tis well that earthly care hath found me, 'Tis well my spirit hath been forced to awake From its day-dreams; that I can be no more The idler that I was in days of yore. XII So now my summer wreath is cull'd and twined, Sweet be its breath to gentle hearts and wise; But April and warm May have left behind Some stray memorials of their changeful skies, Various of scent and hue, of form and kind: Some which stern critics will perchance despise; Some which harsh censors will perchance condemn:â So let it beâthey were not meant for them. XIII But to the lowly, and the pure of heart, These, my young fancy's offspring, I commend; Not without hope that they may bear their part In virtue's aid, and truth's high cause defend, Though framed with careless aim and slender art, In boyhood some, and all ere youth did end. Nor, haply, vain the contrast they display Between the noon and morning of my day. XIV So fare thee well, my book; and ye farewell Once more, serene and pleasant paths of song; Welcome grave cares, on which my heart must dwell, And pastoral toils, not intermitted long. Hereafter if again I tune my shell To court the ear of the world's busy throng, More âcertainâ be its sound, and every theme Such as my graver tasks most fitly may beseem. THE DREAM OF LIFE. BOOK I. CHILDHOOD. INSCRIBED TO MY PARENTS. âHeaven lies about us in our infancy.â Wordsworth. Once more among my earliest haunts!âonce more A solitary man, from home delights Familiar, and the sounds of childish mirth, And sweet endearments of connubial love, Secluded for awhile;âbeneath the roof Vicarage House, Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire.âEd. Which shelter'd me in childhood, and which still Shelters my parents' age, for some few days, A welcome guest, I sojourn. Years long past,â The pleasant spring, and seed-time of my life,â Revisit my mind's eye, with all their train Of youthful thoughts and feelings, by these scenes Mysteriously revived. Nor meets me here One outward token from that newer world Of cares and duties, fears and hopes and aims, Sorrows and joys, in which I live and move, A husband and a parent. Far away, On the green banks of her beloved Doon, My wife imbues our children's opening minds With love of Caledonia's hills and glens; Meanwhile inhaling, near her native coast, From the bold mountains, and the breezy sea, New health and vigour,âby her childhood's friends, As I by mine, surrounded. So complete Is thus my separation from all cares Domestic and parental, that almost, Methinks, by strong imagination led, I might forget the two-and-twenty years Of life, long since mature, which time hath stolen, Since I, as boyhood melted into youth, Bade sad farewell to Eton's long loved shades, And these fair scenes together;âmight forget What all those years have made me,âwhat rich gifts Their course hath brought,âwhat cares those gifts produce,â And be once more the dreaming, brain-sick boy That then I was. And what if I give scope To memory's pensive rovings?âWhat if now, In this calm interim between the calls Of active duty and of worldly care, I bid my heart keep holiday,âforget The Present and the Future in the Past,â Live o'er again my long departed years In tranquil meditation,âand perchance, Comparing what I was with what I am, Amidst that multitudinous array Of thoughts and feelings which have come and gone, Discern, in twilight gaze, the embryo state Of what is now my being?âHaply thus My time may not be lost;âNot for myself, Nor for some gentle spirits, who may find, Nor scorn to learn, a lesson from my lay, Such as all records of Man's life might teach. Dim and mysterious to the dreamer's eye, Retracing the first gleams of consciousness, Is Infancy and Childhood's fairy-land. Scarce through the glory, as of other worlds, Enveloping its outline, is discern'd, At intervals distinctly, here and there, A streak of clear reality,âsome fact, Or feeling, or sensation,âsome event To Childhood's eyes momentous, and thenceforth Indelibly inscribed on Memory's page, Only with life to be expunged. Even here, Surrounded, as I am, by objects fraught With old associations, and none elseâ Wandering, at will, through old familiar rooms, And gazing on old hills, and fields, and lanes, And human forms, the first I ever knew, And faces which I loved ere I could speakâ Even here, my first remembrances of life Seem dim and distant. Scarce at intervals, Events and epochs, few and far between, Stand forth in clear relief;âa colour'd frock,â A picture-book replete with marvels strange To young imagination;âa quaint tale Told by my grandam;âmy first cloth pelisse, With rows of glittering buttons all ablaze, The envy of my infantine compeers; And mix'd with these, at times, a tender gleam Of somewhat (whether fantasy or love I know not,)âa strange instinct lighting up My heart beneath the glance of woman's eyes;â A sense of beauty and mysterious power, By beauty wielded, stirring to its depths The soul of man, while he is yet a child. So fares the world within;âaround me crowd Familiar objects;âour old nursery stands Unalter'd, save that now it bears no trace Of infantine or childish tenantry;â Cradle, or crib, or tiny chair, or store Of scatter'd toys, or window fenced with bars, Or fire-place, guarded close from rash approach, By lofty fender. Time's relentless march Hath made strange havoc with the furniture Once consecrate to childhood's mimic sports. The chairs which, yoked and harness'd, served as steeds To whirl us, on imaginary cars, In pomp and pride of glorious coachmanship, At length have disappear'd through slow decay; Their wood-work fractured, and their horsehair seats Worn bare by long attrition. Many a year,â Yea, far into my manhood's lusty prime, They stood where they were wont, and seem'd to bear A charmed life. In sooth, I could have named Each individual courser,âtold the marks Which once distinguish'd, to our childish thought, The chestnut from the grey, the bay from brown;â Which to each several brother was assign'd, His own especial property;âwhich work'd As wheeler,âwhich as leader. All are gone,â The steeds, and they who drove them. Many a change, Within doors and without, hath changed the face Of the old dwelling, e'en within the span Of my remembrance. Casements, which sufficed The vicars of a less luxurious age, First from the old stone frontage disappear'd, Supplanted by broad panes.âA few years pass'd, Riches increased, and lo! a pile arose Of bright red brick, with slate cerulean roof'd, Encroaching on the garden, and but ill Consorting with the grey, time-mellow'd stone, To which 'twas wedded. On the study's site, Somewhat extended, straightway there appear'd A gay and gilded drawing-room, o'er which, Piled, story above story, tier on tier, New bed-rooms tower'd, in ample space and height Mocking the old and humble vicarage. With pride we mark'd the building, as it grew, (I and my brothers) deeming that at last Our mansion should eclipse the squire's itself, And we be counted greater than the squire. Yet when the work was finish'd, and we dwelt Like nobles, as we deem'd,âmethinks, we found Small compensation in our ceiled state, For old associations swept away With our abolish'd play-roomâfor the fall Of shrubbery laurels, underneath whose thick And sun-proof foliage we were wont to frame Our mimic houses, with inventive skill Arranging and imagining;ânor lack'd To those umbrageous mansions aught that taste Or ingenuity of modish art Might fashion, or caprice of luxury Deem needful for convenience. Banquet-halls Were there, with banquets spread, from time to time, Of sugar'd cakes and gingerbread, served up On fragments of crack'd china; Drawing-rooms Well furnish'd, and adorn'd with stately couch, And ottoman and sofa, soft repose Inviting and prolonging; closets cramm'd With household stores; kitchen and scullery range, With culinary implements complete; And overhead, among the thickleaved boughs, Our verdant dormitories. Oh! how well Wrought then imagination, by strange art, Enduing her creations with what seem'd Most absolute reality. Our sports To us were scarcely sports, but still appear'd Our gravest occupations.âIn our world, (That fairy world created by ourselves), We lived and had our being. All day long, (Our tasks once ended) how we toil'd and toil'd At that fantastic architecture!âhow, Absorb'd, and reckless of all outward things, We shaped and moulded our whole dream of life To match our habitation! Our desires Roam'd not beyond that garden's narrow bounds. There was our universe.âReluctantly We left its pastimes for a daily walk Through the green fields and pleasant shelter'd lanes Of this delicious region; for, in us, The sense of beauty, with majestic forms And glorious hues investing hill and wood, As yet was undevelop'd, and it seem'd Dire interruption of important toil And business which allow'd of no delay, To force us from our fair ideal realm E'en to the pleasures of reality. And yet, from time to time, strange pleasures came; Some by succession of the seasons brought, Or revolution of the calendar; Some at uncertain epochs, racier still Because unlook'd-for. First, the spring produced Its primrose tufts and constellated stalks Of cowslip, which, with eager chase, we sought, And strung together into fragrant balls; Or (proud of such unwonted usefulness) Heap'd for the flowery vintage. Summer shone (Summer seem'd then all sunshine, and as yet Asthma was not) on fields of new-mown grass, And us among the haymakers. Ah me! The raptures of that season!âwith what pride (Our tiny rakes and pitchforks in our hands) We follow'd, with the rest, the mower's track, And spread the levell'd crop beneath the sun! At noon, with what keen appetite we shared The rustic luncheon,âfeasted to the full, Beside some hedge, on piles of bread and cheese, And from its wooden flagon quaff'd the beer, Listening meanwhile to tale and homely jest, Pass'd round by jovial peasants. Then, at eve, When the day's toil was ended, home we rode In the returning waggon,âjoy of joys! The world hath now none such. With autumn came The village wake, and (if remembrance serves) The fair, with stalls of tempting gingerbread, And glittering toys, and shows majestical; While, (for 'twas then the stirring time of war) Recruiting sergeants gaily to and fro Paraded, to the sound of drum and fife, Their colours and cockades. To us they seem'd Almost like gods of war, and oft our hearts Beat high, to think how blest a fate it were To fight old England's enemies, and die Victorious on some well-won battle-field. 'Twas then that on the Nation's startled ear Burst the glad news of naval victory, Sadden'd by Nelson's death. Those news awoke, Methinks, in me, my first ideal sense Of warlike triumph, of heroic deeds, And glory by a nation lost or won. Then first I felt that 'twas a noble lot To be a Briton;âthen, with earnest heart, Rejoiced at England's joy, and wept her griefs, A patriot five years old. Some nameless fears Had stirr'd my soul already, when I heard (What then was widely bruited in men's mouths) Of near invasion, of impending strife, And danger and defeat. The might of France Was, to my heart, a dark, mysterious thought, More hateful from the vagueness of alarm With which 'twas blended, and my midnight dreams Would oft reverberate Napoleon's name, Dreadful as DÃ¦mogorgon's. Oft, in sleep, I heard the thrilling cry, âThe French are come,â And straightway through the street, in long array, With shout of hostile triumph, with deep roll Of drum, and peal of trump, and clang of arms, Battalion on battalion, host on host, Defiled the invading myriads;âBritain's fight, Men said, was fought and lost, and she was now In bondage to her foes. Ere long the scene Grew darker; in my father's house appear'd Strange faces,âheralds by the victors sent To cite my parents to the judgment seat, And haply to the scaffold. In that fear, Grim and perplex'd, the bonds of sleep were burst, And I, in agony of tears, awoke! Such terrors, waking or asleep, were mine, Till news of victory came:âoh, then at once My breast was lighten'd. Ne'er shall I forget The fervour, the wild frenzy of delight, Which, when the news first reach'd our little town, Thrill'd through its English heart. That week had seen A daughter born into my Father's house; And, I remember, in my Mother's room We stood, and from the silent window gazed On bonfires blazing in the street, and crowds Of villagers and peasants round the flame Promiscuously group'd.âThe ruddy light Flash'd fitfully on faces bright with joy, And forms in active motion. To the sky Rockets, from time to time, in fiery track Soar'd, blazed, and, bursting, scatter'd, high in air, Bright showers of stars; while ever and anon, From the near steeple, our six bells rang out Their loud and lusty changes,ânow in notes Harmoniously attuned to concord sweet With the deep stream of joy in every heart,â Now mimicing, with simultaneous clang, The cannons' deafening roar. At intervals, From every quarter, musket-shots were heard, Follow'd by shout, and cheer, and loud huzzah! From congregated throats. The nation's voice, Even among us, arose from Earth to Heaven In chorus of exultant jubilee, Yet with religious fervour not unmix'd, Nor thankless to the God of victories For triumph thus bestow'd.âMen's warlike pride, By recollection of their hero's death, Was soften'd and subdued. It was a night Greatly to be remember'd. With our dreams, When we, with hearts untired, reluctantly Had gone to rest, the tumult of the street Still mingled, and awoke a phantom world Of imagery in the mysterious depths Of Childhood's spirit, shedding wondrous gleams Of glory on the visions of the night. Since then have five-and-thirty years flown by, And boyhood, youth, and early manhood pass'd, With all their changes; yet even now a peal Of merry village bells recalls to mind The raptures of that night, and conjures up The ghosts of thoughts and feelings, in my heart Long buried;âthus with joys of rustic lifeâ A birth, a wedding, or a festival, Associating the glories of the Past. I was not born ambitious;ânever long'd For honour to be won by warlike deeds, Nor wish'd myself a hero;âelse, methinks, The atmosphere of war, in childhood breathed, Had fed such fancies bravely, and perchance Made me unlike, in all things, what I am. For scarce a village in old England, then, But dared heroic enterprize. The threat Of near invasion had awoke all hearts To simultaneous valour. Peasants beat Their pruninghooks and ploughshares into swords; And pale-faced artisans forsook the loom And shuttle, to encumber their spare limbs With the grim garb of war. The smith exchanged His hammer for a halberd. Tailors, fired With martial ardour, from the shop-board leap'd, And let their needles rust, to grasp the spear With fingers which of late the thimble wore. Short-winded, pursy men forgot their fat And scantiness of breath, in tight-drawn belt Bracing their bulk abdominal, to serve As lusty volunteers in some new corps Raised for the nonce. We too, albeit the least Among Britannia's thousands, furnish'd forth Our sixty musqueteersâa gallant band In uniform complete;âto me they seem'd A host invincible, prepared to hurl Napoleon from his throne. Sublime they shone In scarlet regimentals faced with green; Their military caps by towering plumes Surmounted, while their burnish'd firelocks flash'd, Like lightning, in the sun, with bayonets fix'd, Bristling in bright array. The squire himself, Forsaking for awhile his mimic war With birds and beasts, and buckling on his arms, Was proud to be their captain. Next in rank, Nor less in arms illustriousâpassing then Life's vigorous prime, and by his portly shape And peaceful air, less fitted, as it seem'd, For martial prowess than luxurious ease, Our neighbour, the attorney, took the field. Him, not unfit at social boards to shine,â A man of easy humour and frank mirth,â Sluggish withal, and simple as a child In this world's ways, had fortune's wild caprice First doom'd to be a lawyer, and next thrust Into the full accoutrements of war And regimental lace. Alike unfit Was he for scarlet, and for chancery suit; Alike unskill'd in pleadings and in war; In deeds of arms and deeds of law alike Ill-graced and awkward; for his nature, pure And harmless as the dove's, could never learn The serpent's wisdom;âgentle as the lamb, He lack'd the lion's valour.âHe was form'd For upright acts of honest friendliness, For charity and bland good neighbourhood, Not for the tumult of the battle-field, Or trickery of the law-court. Mild, sedate, His usual air;âfew were the words he spoke, And slow his utterance; but when friend met friend Around his hospitable board, and wine, After the fashion of those ruder days, In circling brimmers flow'd,âoh, who was then His match for fun and frolic? Then his eye (Dull and professionally grave before) Twinkled and gleam'd with humour;âthen (all care For formal rules of etiquette cast off) His mirth ran riot in wild, boylike freaks Of unrestrain'd extravagance. But now, Silent and grave, beside his corps he march'd; And if,âwhen cups were sparkling on the board Of absent friends, while he, on full parade, Did active service,ânature would at times Grow weary of manÅuvres manifold, Marchings and counter-marchings, mimic-fights, Retreats and charges, ambuscades, assaults, Volleys of awkward musketry, and balls Shot wide of targets,âhe, with noble pride Of self-control, repress'd all outward signs And tokens of impatience,âproud to be In Albion's cause a martyr. Him of late I mark'd, an aged man, well-nigh fourscore, Still, in the parish church, his wonted seat Maintaining, and himself but little changed In all these years from that which he appear'd When first I knew him;âundiminish'd still His lusty bulk,âunwrinkled still his brow,â Unspectacled his nose;âyet Death's grim shades Must soon be closing round him, and the friends,â The boon companions of his earlier days,â His comrades in the field and at the feast,â Have, one by one, departed from his side, And dropp'd into the grave. His housekeeper (For never hath he worn connubial yoke), Large as himself, and rosy, and rotund, The despot of his house, hath gone the way Appointed for all flesh;âhis well-fed steed Hath vacated the true prebendal stall In which he lived to eat, asthmatic long And martyr to repletion;âhis lank pair Of greyhounds (sole lank things in all that house) Sleep, with their old companion, side by side,â Their last course run and ended. Be their lord's Decease, when it shall come, as calm as theirs, But not, like theirs, uncheer'd by Christian hope Of immortality and endless bliss. With him there march'd, as ensign of the corps, A tall, spare man, his kinsman, some ten years His senior, whose high forehead, silver'd o'er, At fifty-five, with eighty winters' snow, Assumed, beneath his feather'd, fierce cock'd hat, A veteran aspect;âyet a peaceful man Was he, and had, in Gloucester's busy vales, Been bred a manufacturer. The mill, Embosom'd yonder between wooded banks, Was built, and many years possess'd by him; Till, with an ample store of this world's wealth, He and his wife, with none to be their heirs, (For theirs had ever been a childless home) Retired to spend their calm decline of life In affluent ease and leisure. Twenty years Were they our next-door neighbours. As a child, I well remember, when the parsonage On rare occasions oped its festal doors To guests invited, how, amidst the throng, His was the gravest face, the stateliest step, The hoariest head; with what a solemn grace He at quadrille or whist would take his seat, Confronted with some bulky dowager, Or spinster of threescore. The dark brown coat, White waistcoat, breeches of demurest drab, And hose of spotless cotton, (for as yet Silk was, with us, a luxury only known To clergymen and squires,) the polish'd shoes Of rustic make, and thicker than need was, Still dwell in my remembrance. On his arm Hung his good-humour'd partner, all bedight In finery, such as fifty years before Had shone in metropolitan saloons. Herself ungraced by the accomplishments Of modish education, and, in truth, What some call vulgar, but, beyond her peers, From all vulgarity of soul exempt;â Kind-hearted, full of charity, unchill'd By niggard thrift,âfor all the neighbouring poor Prompt ever both to spend and to be spent; Alike unfit to hear and to repeat The scandal of the tea-table. They lived (She and her mate) a blameless, peaceful life, Through fifty years of wedlock, till at last Disease, in cancerous shape, assail'd the wife, Marring her features, and extending wide Its fibres through her flesh.âFor some few years She pined and wasted, with assiduous care Still tended by her husband, whose whole life Was so entwined with hers, that, when she died, The old man's heart seem'd broken.âFrom that hour He never cross'd the threshold of his door, Save when he went to church,âbut sat and sat Beside his lonely hearth from morn to night; Now poring o'er his Bible,ânow absorb'd In dreamy thought,âhis eyes suffused with tears,â His heart with her whom he had lost,âin Heaven. Nor sought he other company; though oft, When friends or neighbours came to visit him, He would converse in no uncheerful tone, Nor close his heart to sympathy with those Who sympathized with him. Some habits, form'd In happier days,âsome customs, shared with her, He still retain'd;âstill every Sunday eve (The service done) he with his kinsman dined, Whose jovial humour, soften'd now by years, Was, in his presence, temper'd to a grave And reverential sadness:âeach with each Held soothing fellowship, till life's frail thread At last, in one, gave way. His race is run; His story told;âhe rests with her he loved. A melancholy joy, in truth, it is, When half a life has fled, to see once more Places long loved;âto mark how Nature's face Remains unchanged,âhow little Art has wrought Of transformation in insensate things, While human forms familiarâmen who lived, Thought, felt, rejoiced, and sorrow'd, hoped and fear'd, Hated and loved, in time's relentless flight, Have been, by generations, swept away, Like shadows, from the earth. But sadder still, Methinks, the alteration wrought by age In those who yet remain. These thirty years A house hath scarce been built, a tree cut down, A new shop open'd,âscarce a public-house Been deck'd with a new sign, or changed as yet Ought but its owner's name, in all this street. The castle ditch alone, (last remnant left Of feudal recollections,) hath indeed Long since, by hands barbarian, been plough'd up And planted with potatoes; its rich shade Of beeches levell'd, and the fair alcove Which crown'd its spacious bowling-green, pull'd down. Nought else seems alter'd, save the face of man; But that, how strangely! Yesterday I pass'd An infant school-room, echoing to the hum Of children's voices on their tasks intent; And, through the open window, could discern The features of their mistress. 'Twas a face, Almost the first which Memory, looking back Through forty years, remembers to have loved;â The face of one long since our nursery-maid, The beauty of the village. Around her Our young imaginations fondly clung, And, in her features, seem'd to recognize The bright ideals of our fairy tales Mysteriously embodied. In our eyes, She was the princess Eglantine, adored Of Valentine and Orson;âwe the twins Contending for her hand. The Sabra she Who loved St. George of England, and by him Was lost amidst the forest; then straightway Protected by a lion. She alone Seem'd gentle Graciosa's living type, Through depths unknown of trouble and distress, Still constant to her Percinet.âNor lack'd Our spite a fitting representative Of old malicious Grognon,âthat foul hag Who persecuted beauty, youth, and love, For very ugliness. Her, to the life, We found depicted in a spinster sour, The despot of our nursery;âone whose tried And unimpeach'd devotion to her charge Compensated, in fond parental eyes, For all her inborn crabbedness; who ruled With undisputed, arbitrary sway The rising generation, and the risen; Queen'd it supreme o'er mistress and o'er maid; And thus, by rigour of tyrannic rule, Combined in close-knit league against herself, Us and our pretty play-mate. In revenge Of wrongs, supposed or real, her we named Witch, ogre, wicked fairy, goblin, imp, Giantess, evil genius, Afrit, goule, And whatsoever abhorr'd and hateful thing Imagination of the East or West Hath ever bodied forth. And yet, in truth, Much cause had we to love her, could the love Of children be obtain'd by honest zeal Apart from gentleness;âand if sometimes She yielded to infirmity,âif years, Approaching to threescore, had fail'd to quench, In her, the wish to be a wife, and thus Made her too oft the dupe of needy men, Seeking not her but hers, and furnish'd food For laughter even to us,âbe that forgot In the remembrance of her faithful life And melancholy death. For,âafter years In strict discharge of anxious duty spent, Worn out at last by the incessant fret And fever of a spirit ill at ease, And, haply, vex'd by our perversity Almost beyond endurance,âshe resolved To quit our parents' service, and retire, On the small savings by long labour earn'd, To end her days in peace;âthen changed her mind, Through love for us and ours;âagain resolved,â And yet again repented;âtill at last, Wearied by what, in her, appear'd caprice, Our parents lost all patience, and resolved She should indeed depart. Thenceforth no more She lifted up her head, nor could regain Her full command of reason:âfrom her home She wander'd and return'd not:âin the end, After long, anxious search, her corpse was found Beneath the Severn waters. But the maid,â The dark-eyed heroine of fairy-land,â How hath her fortune sped? Alas! her tale Is one of kindred sorrow. Long ago (So long that I can scarce remember when) She married; and had he, to whom she gave Her hand and heart, been worthy of the gift, Might now have held her head above the crowd With decent self-respect:âalas! he proved A drunkard and a brute. Soon ruin came, And gaunt-eyed famine stared them in the face: Her children proved rebellious, and she lived A broken-hearted woman, struggling still, In unsubdued nobility of soul, With care, and want, and sorrow; till at length Compassion and respect for her meek worth, From those whom she had served in early youth, Made her the mistress of that infant school Where yesterday I found her;âbut alas! How should a wounded spirit, such as hers, Bear up against her task?âwhat energy, In her, remains to vary and sustain Perpetual sallies of exciting sport, And stimulative effort?âhow should she, Whose heart is bleeding for her husband's sin, Her offspring lost, her home left desolateâ How should she feel the interest, here required, In children not her own? With listless air She sits, in dull, mechanical routine, Dragging along her weary load of tasks; Dispensing vain rewards and punishments; Dispirited and jaded by the sound Of voices which she heeds not; till the clock, With wish'd-for stroke, announces her release, Emancipating from ungrateful toil The teacher and the taught.âThus Life's romance Begins and ends:âits moral,âthat our world Is, was, and, till redemption's closing day, Must evermore remain a vale of tears. Yet there are spots of sunshine even on Earth;â Green islands in the desert, which the sands Entomb not, nor the tempests overwhelm:â Spots which, long cherish'd in our heart of hearts, Then, after many years revisited, We find still fresh and fragrant. Yonder lane, Which,âfrom the church-yard gate commencing, skirts The school enclosure and the castle ditch,â Leads, in the space of some two hundred yards, Beside a lonely cottage, from the path Divided by a wicket. It was once, (Far within my remembrance,) the abode Of a kind aged couple, who, when years Had made the man unfit to earn his bread At that mechanic craft which he had learnt And practised, as a builder, all his life, From business and its cares at length withdrew, Surrendering to a son-in-law their trade And daily occupation. In their home, The latter, with his wife, their only child,â (Themselves, in middle age, a childless pair,) Came to reside; and though her husband seem'd To some a vain and consequential man, The frank and noble nature of his wife Made more than full amends for what appear'd Deficiencies in him. There seem'd to rest A blessing on that house;âContent was there, And filial duty, with connubial love Holding, in one warm bosom, constant sway, And spreading through the home in which it dwelt Perpetual sunshine. Between them and us (The cottage and the vicarage) grew up A friendship, such as we had sought in vain Beneath less humble roofs. Nature had set On that old man and woman, at their birth, The seal of true gentility, which they Transmitted to their daughter. Oft in her, When other sources fail'd, was found advice And consolation, sympathy and help, Amidst those worldly troubles which must fall On rich and poor alike. Full oft was she The confidante of sorrows, to no ear But hers entrusted; and, for us, whose age Reck'd of no nice distinction between ranks, But clung to kindness, wheresoever found, With instinct true and keen,âin all the world There was no heart like hers. Day after day, In pairs or singly,âsometimes all at once,â We stole from home, to prattle and to play In that old cottage and the timber-yard Adjacent. I shall never, while I live, Forget the old man's cheerful countenance, Lit up with gleams of humour, as he sat And welcomed us in his accustomed seat Within the chimney corner;âhis broad jests,â His cordial fun,âhis brown, close, curly wig, His straight blue coat with monstrous buttons starr'd,â His nether garments, plush or velveteen,â The sky-blue worsted stockings on his shanks,â The buckles in his shoes. His busy wife, Unbroken by the weight of fourscore years, Meanwhile, with ceaseless footsteps, roam'd about, And plied her household tasks, with ready tact Assisted by her daughter, and by us Impeded sorely;âyet they never lost Patience or kindness, but still bore our freaks And follies with a spirit imperturb'd; Nor wearied of such pert impertinence As would have wearied Job. On baking-days, Which we by instinct knew, their batch contain'd (Nor ever fail'd) one smoking cake for us,â One smoking, butter'd cake!âTheir cider-press Ream'd with rich draughts for us;âtheir garden teem'd With gooseberries and currants, which to us Yielded unstintingly their luscious juice. We were the lords of all that fair domain,â Too oft, perhaps, the tyrants. Time roll'd on; We left the place and country,ânor return'd, Till thirteen years had pass'd. The old man then Had, in the ripeness of full ninety years, Been gather'd to his fathers; and his wife Slept with him side by side. The cottage still Shelters the younger pair, who, in their turn, Themselves have sunk into the vale of years; And to our children are, what once, to us, Their parents used to be. Nay, so robust Their age appears, that haply they may see Another generation. To their house Our steps still daily turn, when we renew Our visits to the neighbourhood, and still They welcome us as they were ever wont, And spoil our children with as right good will As once they spoil'd the parents. All remains Beneath that roof unchanged;âupon the shelves The clean, white rows of plates, and in the midst, One of green wedgwood, still uncrack'd; above The chimney-piece, its old abundant store Of tin and pewter, amidst which appears (Chief ornament) a glittering brazen cross, Which, fifty years ago, the husband bore, Surmounting the blue staff, on festal days, Borne by the members of the Friendly Club. The wife (except that threescore years and ten Have silver'd o'er her hair) continues still The same in form and feature. Age hath tamed The loftier spirit of her partner down; Who, when I visited their cottage last, Was reading, with a fix'd abstracted look, The Olney hymns. To me it seems as though That couple and the world must live and die Together; and whene'er their humble roof Shall shelter other tenants, 'twill be time For me to close, for ever, Memory's book, And cease to think on scenes and days gone by. With feelings different far, yet not unmix'd With melancholy interest, I behold Yon square-built house, by jealous walls and gates (Enclosing, in its front, a spacious court,) Shut out and barricaded from the street. A proud, aristocratic Hall it seems, Not courting, but, discouraging approach, Save from a favour'd few. For many a year That house hath been to me a place forbid,â Impervious, inaccessible. And yet Few are there with remembrances more rich Of young enjoyment in my thought combined; Enjoyment brief, but pure. 'Twas long the home Of one with deepest sorrow conversant; A wife and mother, o'er whose later years, Blameless, yet broken-hearted, be a veil Of reverential silence drawn by me. Her elder sons and daughters had grown up Almost to youthful prime, while I was yet A boy unbreech'd,âthe youngest, some few years My senior;âwe could scarce be playfellows, And yet were oft companions. 'Twas to them A dignified delight to guide our sports, And teach us new ones;âto protect and aid Our tender age;âand well did they discharge Such duty, self-imposed. On Sunday noons, As we return'd from church, we never fail'd To greet each other in the street,âand then, To us, it was the proudest joy on earth To be invited, (as full oft we were,) To end the day with them:âat will we roam'd Around their spacious garden, and at will Wander'd, with them, about the fields at eve, Until the sun had set:âthen, to beguile The twilight hours, the book of Common Prayer, Adorn'd with wondrous prints, was summon'd in; And sometimes hymns were sung, which still, methought, Sounded most sweetly from that Lady's lips. So pass'd our Sunday blameless; nor alone Our Sunday,âfor on week-days too we met Not rarely, nor with stinted intercourse; Until between our parents discord fell, From pastoral duty faithfully perform'd, And marr'd our old companionship.âNot ours The fault,âand yet to us the fruits it bore Appear'd most bitter. I remember well, The evening when (all prospect being past Of reconciliation) our young friends Came, at their father's bidding, to our house, To bid their last farewell. A sad one 'twas; And, from that time, a strange unnatural state Of separation between house and house For years and years continued. We became The village Capulets and Montagus; Yet all save oneâ(the master of one house) Most anxious for re-union;ânor, perhaps, Could his sole pleasure (e'en had he so will'd) Have ended all communion between those Whom inclination join'd. From time to time We met and talk'd together;âit befell, Day after day, by strangest accident, That they and we both walk'd at the same hour, Both hit on the same walks. As years pass'd on, And youth began to dawn, those walks assumed A more romantic air. Love-rhymes were writ, And assignations made, and duly kept, With more deliberate purpose:âthen commenced The nightly serenade,âthe moonlight stroll; And, but for some disparity of years, Perchance the hostile houses had not lack'd A Romeo or a Juliet.â Those wild days Have long been over, and the grave hath closed Above both wife and husband; yet even now Dark sorrow seems to brood upon that house, Enwrapping it in gloomâthrough which appear Gleams, not, I trust, delusive, of that light Which shineth more and more to perfect day. But all too long this retrospective mood I cherish,âwith a fond garrulity Babbling, at life's full noon, of morning dreams. 'Tis time I should awake:âand yet each spot Around me teems with recollections, such As I would fain indulge. There's nought so mean And insignificant in all this place, But is endued with power to strike some chord Of old associations. Yonder barn, Secluded from the street a little space, And in no wise distinguish'd outwardly From others of its class, was once to me A scene of strange enchantment; for a troop Of strolling players built up beneath its roof Their rude and rustic theatre. Till then The drama was, to us, an unknown world, Save that when last our family had gone To visit the metropolis, (a rare And wonderful occurrence) we all went To Sadler's Wells and Astley's. Ne'er again Was such intense illusion to beguile Our senses and our souls as seized us then. We were at once translated from this world Of sober daylight to a fairy realm, Mysteriously existing in the midst Of human habitations, yet from all Distinct and self-compact, by human laws Ungovern'd, and to rules conventional Of human custom unamenable. The theatre itself appear'd to us A palace of enchantment,âits gay tiers Of gilded boxes semicircularâ Its mirror'd columnsâits glass chandeliers,â The central lustre, by some means unknown, But necromantic, as appear'd to us, Drawn up into the ceiling, and again Descending to its placeâthe row of lights, With sudden blaze emerging from the floor,â The dark green curtain, veiling from our sight An unknown world, mysterious,âthe first note Prelusive of the tuning orchestra, Soon bursting, with sublime and swelling crash, Into full concord of harmonious sound,â The rising of the curtain, all at once Disclosing to our sight transcendent scenes Of brilliancy and bliss, surpassing all Our young imagination e'er had dream'd Of fairy-landâour fairy tales themselves (For so it chanced) no longer by the mind Imperfectly received, but to the eye Reveal'd distinctlyâBeauty and the Beast, Tom Thumb, and Cinderella, by strange art Converted from mere phantoms of the thought To visible realitiesâall this Was, to our minds, a new creation, fraught With glory from some brighter world derived. The very orange-women seem'd to us Scarce of this earth,âscarce earthly. Such had been Our earliest joys theatrical: but now The full illusion was, in part, to cease; And nature, stripp'd of pomp and circumstance, To supersede enchantment. Small and low,â Hung round with tapestry of worn-out scenes, And, by a thin partition, into pit And gallery scarce dividedâits whole band One solitary fiddleâsometimes two,â Its stage cribb'd, cabin'd, and confinedâwith few And paltry decorations,âdresses, scenes, All suited each to each,âthat theatre E'en at first sight, gave warning, by its looks, That histrionic art within those walls, Apart from all appliances and means, Must, by its strength or weakness, stand or fall. Yet there did mimic talent, with all aid Of outward show dispensing, in our hearts Awaken childhood's earnest sympathies. There we rejoiced with them that did rejoice, And wept with them that wept;âthere learnt to feel The dignity of Virtue in distress, And with her triumphs sympathize;âthere grieved For Woman's bitter wrong, and burnt with zeal Heroic to avenge it. Were such thoughts And feelings sinful all? In sober truth, When I review those hours, I deem them not Mispent or useless;âand if riper years, Instructing me more fully in the lore Of good and evil, have reveal'd a world Of mischief in the stage,âif I forbear To breathe its dangerous atmosphere, or soil My priestly garments with the taint it bears,â Such sacrifice I grudge not, but exult With thankfulness that I have better joys To gladden me on Earth:âbut then no doubt Or dim misgiving e'er had cross'd my mind; No dark suspicion of inherent guilt Estranged me from its magic:âall the ill (If ill there was) by me was unperceived; The good, I think, remain'd with me;âsome thoughts And feelings were develop'd, which perchance, In after years, have sway'd my inner man With no unwholesome influence;âsome power Was given me to perform my task on Earth. Fair valley, verdant pastures, gentle stream Winding along thy bold and wooded banks, With most melodious murmur;ânoble hills, Mountains almost, o'ershadowing, with your dark And craggy grandeur, scenes than which our isle Can scarcely boast more beauteous;âtranquil town;â Grey, venerable Church, with steeple white Up tapering to the dim and distant sky;â Church in whose gothic aisles I first beheld And join'd, as childhood could, the solemn forms Of Christian worship;âthou, too, noble Hallâ Crowning yon wooded hill in gorgeous state Of architectural magnificence;â Hall long deserted, and, for many a day, Connected in our fancies with dark tales Of Romish priestcraft,âvisited sometimes, And view'd, by me and mine, through all thy suites Of empty rooms and mouldering furniture, With somewhat of a superstitious awe;â And, last and dearest, my paternal roof, Not yetânot soon, I trust, to pass away, With this frail life's continuance, from the pair Whom still it shelters;âeach and all, farewell! There is no spot in all that span of earth By me best known, to which with livelier grief I speak that parting word, than this wherein Ye congregate and crowd upon my sight. And yet, for me, is Britain studded o'er With spots to memory dear,âand some almost As beautiful as this. E'en now I go To join, in haunts which I have loved for years, Those whom I love still better:ânothing loth, And yet with swelling heart, I take my leave Of this sweet region, in my inmost heart Cherish'd through life, revisited with joy Still fresh, still pure as ever!ânot for long, Not, as I trust, for many tedious months I now depart:âHome of my earliest years! My heart's first home!âonce moreâfarewell! farewell! BOOK II. BOYHOOD. INSCRIBED TO MY CHILDREN. âShades of the prison-house begin to close Upon the growing boy.â Wordsworth My sonsâand ye especially, my first And second born, whose years already pass That term which to the schoolboy's dignity Advances, for the most part, your compeersâ To you this second lay, design'd to tell A schoolboy's tale, I dedicate.âEre long, Or singly, or together, you must launch Your untried skiffs from this calm harbour, home, On school's tempestuous sea;ânot all unfit,â Not unprepared by previous discipline, I trust, albeit home-nurtured, to essay Such voyage;âfor not delicately rear'd In mind or body, not in nursery cage Too long immured, nor pamper'd have ye been With drawing-room delights, nor train'd to trip In lady-like gymnastics, nor imbued With lore alone which ladies love to teach; But, from your tender years, to sports robust Inured, and manly studies.âYe could climb, Ere seven years old, with toil of hands and knees, The loftiest peak of Arran's mountain ridge, Where eagles train their nestlings;âye can breast The ocean-waves, and buffet them away With lusty strokes;âon horseback or afoot, Ye shrink from no fatigue;âthro' Doon's clear pools, Reckless how deep, the livelong summer day, With rod in hand ye plunge, nor quit your sport E'en though the inclement skies should pelt and pour A deluge on your heads;âand when the frost With panoply of thickest ice hath mail'd Our Avon's bosom, ye on trenchant skates Athwart the glassy surface, swift as light, Curve within curve describe,ânot inexpert E'en at the âoutside edge:ââNor have your minds Been all untutor'd, nor with ancient lore And modern unimbued:âbut chiefly ye Have, by the wisdom of a mother's heart, And that most holy tenderness of love, Which none but mothers feel, been taught to know And reverence Truth and Virtue:âye have spent Your infancy and childhood, and the dawn Of thoughtful life, by impulses to good, And many a pure, religious influence Surrounded and impell'd:âno morn hath risen, No night closed round the world, but ye have knelt (And oft, I trust, with no unthoughtful prayer,) Spreading the open volume of your hearts Before God's throne, in words first taught by her To whom you owe your earthly, and whate'er Of heavenly life, is yours:âHer solemn tones Discoursing, ere you slept, at your bedsides, Of righteousness, of judgment, and of sin, Of Providence and duty, oft and oft Have mingled with your dreams, excluding thence All foul and hateful images:âyour tasks, Your pleasures, your employments, have by her Been ruled and guided, sweeten'd and applied With most prevailing wisdom, to those ends Which she hath most at heart:âyour home hath been A happy oneâthe centre and the source Of healthful joys, which ye have minister'd Each to the other, or together shared; And thus have learnt, through mutual self-restraint, And mutual joy, imparted and received, To love each other dearly.âI am sure Thatâwhatsoever may in after years Befall you,âboth will always love your home,â Your childhood's home,âand that the thought of it Will be a purifying thought to both, When we are in our grave. Nor will you lose E'en yet, I trust, its shelter:âSchool, to you, Will bring no exile from the haunts you love, From cheering and familiar looks and words, Or from parental aid:âamidst the cares, The conflicts, and the interests, new and strange, The doubts and the distresses, which, ere long, Must chequer your school life, you will retain One harbour and sure hold;âunlike your sire, Who, in old times, when railways yet were not, And coaches travell'd scarce six miles an hour, At eight years old was sent away to school A hundred miles from home. In after-life, With all its ebbs and flows of joy and grief, Its tears and smiles, its welcomes and farewells, There is no separation like that first Between the child and parent.âI can still Remember how, when it had been resolved That I should go to school, it seem'd to me As though some fearful evil, undefined, Mysterious, vague, hung over me;âmy heart Presaged, it knew not what,âdisruption dire Of old home ties and sympathies,âdread loss Of comforts and of kindness, ne'er till then Esteem'd or valued, and, in place of these, Harsh treatment, stern restraint, relentless law, Inexorable justice.âFearful tales Of academic discipline severe, Stripes and starvation, and imprisonment, Rose up from memory's cells in grim array, To scare imagination.âWell for me, It chanced that on our road we were to halt (My father and myself) for some few days At an ancestral mansion, there to meet A cousin, who (my senior by five years,) Was, at the school to which we both were bound, To act as my protector.âThe last boon Vouchsafed me was to fix the fatal day On which we should leave home; and I, who oft Had been most happy in that ancient Hall, Of two proposed, decided on the first, There to prolong my stay; but when I saw My mother's grieved and disappointed look, Though she spoke not, I felt my choice was wrong, And the next moment, would have barter'd worlds For leave to change it,âyet, through pride or shame, Still held my peace perversely:âso we went As it had been resolved, and in few days, (Our passing visit ended) reach'd the town Where dwelt my future pedagogue. E'en now I well remember, how, with lingering wheels, Our chaise approach'd the house:âit was a low White plaister'd vicarage, in front of which, A row of close-trimm'd limes, which interlaced Their topmost branches, form'd a sort of fence Between it and the churchyard:ânot far off Stood the old church itself, against whose broad And battlemented tower, some striplings tall (Grown men they seem'd to me) were playing then, Irreverently, I thought, a game at fives. The master, a hale man of sixty years, In curl'd and powder'd and full bottom'd wig, (The symbol, then, of pedagogues) advanced Beneath the limes to welcome us, and soon, Within a comfortable parlour housed, We with his wife, himself, and his two sons, Assistants and joint partners in the school, Were holding fearless converse:âthe dread spell Was broken;âschool seem'd not so dread a place As I had still conceived it;âhalf the weight That lay upon my heart was taken off; And not until the parting moment came,â Not till my parent, seated in the chaise, Which was to bear him homeward, turn'd him round To take his farewell look, did I, at last, Feel all my desolation.âThere I stood, Surrounded by strange faces, each and all Impertinently curiousâevery tongue Let loose in countless questionings;âmy name, Age, parentage, condition, birth-place, home, Proficiency in Latinâwith swift haste, Ask'd, answer'd, and reported;âI meanwhile Awkward and shy, and grievously perplex'd By such unceasing cannonade of talk, Stood helpless;âhere and there a face express'd Compassion, as I thought, and sympathy: Nor was I, with my kinsman at my side, Bereft of all protection;âyet it seem'd That when, with sudden clang, the bell rang out Which summon'd us to supper, I was freed, As by a friendly voice, from the assaults Of reckless persecution.âBut, that meal!â That first school supper!âhow unlike it seem'd The comfortable board with tea-cups graced, The glory of my home!âthose tables rough, Unconscious of a table-cloth, with ink Profusely flooded, and by pocket-knives, In characters of every size and shape, With names of generations past inscribed;â Those masses, huge and square, of flaccid cheese, And bread unbutter'd, which each ravenous boy, Plateless and forkless, seized with eager grasp And carved, like hungry ploughman, with a knife Drawn from his pouch;âthose tall white earthen quarts Of drink, by men call'd beer, but swipes by boys;â Such fare, so served, demanded hungrier maw Than mine yet was, to relish it.âFull soon The meal was ended, andâwithout a word Of grace, or vesper service offer'd up,â We were dismiss'd to bed;âso prayerless then Were all our English schools;âbut ere I slept, The thought of home and habits home-instill'd Came fresh upon my heart:âwith bended knee And clear articulation, undismay'd, I said my wonted prayer.âOur master's wife, Who stood beside me, I remember well, Seem'd touch'd by such unwonted fear of Heaven; And, bidding me good night, devoutly pray'd That I might long remain what then I was. Vain hope!âa martyr's spirit would have quail'd (Had such been mine) beneath the unpitying storm Of ridicule and insult, rude reproach, And scorn contemptuous, which, from that wild rout Of boisterous urchins burst upon the head Of such as, like myself, retain'd as yet Some remnant of home-feelingsâsome faint trace Of care for holy things.âIt was their pride,â Their never-failing sport, to drag to light The secret thoughts of each most gentle heart, And then, with rude, sarcastic ribaldry, To set them up for laughing-stocks.âThe soul, Thus outraged, sunk into itself aghast, And brooded o'er its treasure silently, Not without deep resentment.âSome there were, Who, with deceitful show of sympathy, Would worm their way into the confidence Of unsuspecting victims,âwin complete And unreserved disclosure of whate'er Lay nearest to their hearts,âthe names they loved, Their fond remembrances of home-delights,â The hopes they cherish'dâall that was the food, The pure refreshment of their inner life;â Then straight betray the secrets, darkly won, And, with demoniac insult, rend and crush The feelings and affections thus evoked From the soul's inmost depths.âIt had been strange Had spirits, thus abused, retain'd unchill'd Their innate tenderness.âEre long, a new And less confiding nature crusted o'er The surface of the old:âtheir hearts were sear'd And harden'd to the blows they had to bear; And what they lost in tenderness, perchance They gain'd in firm endurance,âthus prepared To grapple with the world, and breathe, unhurt, Its chilling atmosphere.âSuch lot was mine; Such must be yours, my children.âBe it so; I seek not to avert what I lament, But know to be the inevitable doom Of Man in this rude Earth;âperchance 'tis well That this, your first collision with the world, Should also be your bitterest. Yet think not That, when that shock is o'er, the schoolboy life Is otherwise than happy. Time heals o'er The wounds which the young heart so keenly feels: Our nature soon conforms itself to that Of each new world in which it is to dwell, And takes its form and impress:âsuch at least Was my experience;âcasting off my shy Home-nurtured meekness, I began, ere long, To rough it with my fellows, and soon won From persecution clear immunity. Nor, when I now look back on those old days, Can I discern much real grief mix'd up With their abundant gladness.âIn that school, Terror and pain and punishment were known So little, that, ere many days had past, I learnt to deem the tales, which I had heard Of magisterial tyranny, profane And old wives' fables: birchen rods appear'd Mere figments of the brain; and weeks elapsed Ere execution on one luckless wight Duly perform'd, proved that, beyond all doubt, Such tales were fundamentally correct, And true at bottom.âThus our school-hours pass'd, Not often sadly; and, when school was o'er, We had abundant change of joyous sports;â Fives, cricket, foot-ball, in its season each; And (what to horticultural adepts Yielded a graver joy) to each his plot Of garden ground assign'd, producing crops Of choicest salad herbs,âgreen lettuces, Mustard and cress, and radishes, oblong Or turnip-shaped, which graced our evening meal, And added to its relish.âOnce a year Each gather'd of green gooseberries, wherewithal, From his own garden, to compound a pie, Which, baked at the adjacent pastry-cook's, Supplied a crowning feast.âOn summer eves, Conducted by our masters, and with them Sharing the rapturous pleasure, we were wont In Kennet's silver stream to plunge amain. Ah me! to think how sorely, at the first, My heart misgave me!âwhat a weight of fear I hid beneath a bold and cheerful brow, When on the river's grassy marge I stood, And heard the mill-dam waters, through their gates Let loose, with thundering torrent rage and roar! Brief terror! soon succeeded by delight Extatic. Nor were more romantic joys Denied us;âto a neighbouring forest, ranged By herds of the red deer, sometimes we went On holidays, and underneath an oak (The forest monarch) spread upon the grass Our sylvan banquet:âthere, from branch to branch We chased the squirrels, and sometimes, athirst For manlier sport, assail'd the herd itself, Like Robin Hood's bold outlaws in the glades Of Sherwood;âbut such holidays were rare: Our every-day diversions were confined Almost within the churchyard's narrow bounds. Amidst the graves we sported, rarely touch'd By aught of solemn feeling, to the place Accordantâsave that never, after dark, We loved to pass near one mysterious part Of the old churchâa kind of catacomb Or mausoleum on the northern side, Encompassing a single marble tomb,â A tomb without a name, inscriptionless. Of him who slept beneath it fearful things Were rumour'd and believedâa dark, strange tale Of infant murderâof acquittal gain'd Through legal subtletyâof large estates, Held by the owner of a neighbouring Hall, For service by an ancestor perform'd, In dread forensic strife for life or death, To that mysterious tenant of the grave. 'Twas seldom that the door of that dread vault Was open'd;âwhen it was, with shuddering awe Sometimes we ventured in, and there beheld, Suspended on the wall, the mouldering lines Of a pale portrait, and what seem'd to us The etching of some dark mysterious deed Cut rudely upon brass. But 'twas not long Before that churchyard in our eyes assumed An interest more impressive:âin her home, After long years of patient slow decline, Our master's daughter died. Her once I saw White as a sheeted ghost, with thin blue lips EmaciateâDeath's dread seal upon her brow,â Yet not, methought, unlovely:âwith a friend,â A female friend, the solace and support Of her long weary sickness, she conversed In whisper'd accents,âfor her voice was gone; And when I look'd upon her face, even I Could tell her end was near:âfull soon it came:â We heard that she was dead, and, in few days, Were summon'd to attend her to the grave. That long procession of dejected boys Following the corpse of one almost as young As some among themselves, and to the dust Beholding her, with solemn rites, consign'd,â That was my first near intercourse with death. But few months pass'd ere to the daughter's tomb The mother too was borne, and, with his sons, Unbroken still, although by grief sore tried, The father lived a widower. Shades like these, Gloomy but transient, swept across the heart Even of that childish, gay community; But soon their trace wore off, and joy return'd, Brighter from brief suspension:âyet, though grief To us was a rare visitant,âthough scarce Could we, in conscience, whisper to ourselves That we could well be happier than we wereâ With what intense expectant eagerness We look'd for our deliverance; and when June Brought back the roses, or December bound The earth in frosty chains, with what parade Of science arithmetical we framed Our calendars of weeks, and days, and hours; Computing the minutest point of time Which must elapse before the holidays. Then, when the wish'd-for morning had arrived, How we awoke ere sunrise!âif 'twas dark, How eagerly we watch'd for the first streak Of candle-light beneath our bed-room doors Significantly stealing !âin what haste We huddled on our clothes!âwith ears how keen We listen'd for the roll of distant wheels! And when, before the gate, the long array Of chaises, from the neighbouring town dispatch'd To bear us to our homes, assembled stood, Who could restrain his transport?âThen what din Of horns arose!âwhat ceaseless cannonade Of pea-shooters and pop-guns!âwith what zeal Of emulative mischief shots were aim'd At windows which we pass'd!âhow proud was he Who crack'd the largest number!âbut even these, Though joys indeed, were joys of small account Compared to that intensity of bliss Which I at least enjoy'd, when I approach'd Once more my wish'd for home.âSome three miles off, Familiar haunts and walks which I had loved, And spots connected, in my heart of hearts, With pleasant recollections, by degrees Stole on me in succession;ânor, I think, Shall I, as long as I exist, forget How, at one well-known angle in the road, My Father, who on horseback had come forth To welcome me, appear'd;ânext, some small space Behind, in mirthful and expectant group, Brothers and sisters, in full progress all, To meet and ride home with me in the chaise. That night I slept once more in my old bed,â My own old darling bed;âits site unchanged, The pattern of its curtains still the same; And if unmix'd contentment e'er was mine, 'Twas in the sober certainty I felt Of its complete identity. But Time, Jealous of day-dreams at life's sober noon, Forbids me to enlarge upon the joys And sorrows of those early schoolboy years. Scarce noticed I pass o'er the Christmas sports Of multifarious cousins, round one hearth, From the four quarters of the compass met, Filling one spacious ancestorial Hall With the loud uproar of their merriment; The children's danceâthe game at blind man's buff,â The courtships and flirtations, three parts jest, And one part earnest, between boy and girl Already knit in bonds of cousinhood;â Then,âwith a breath dissolving love's light chains,â Black Monday, and his heart-breaking farewells;â The swift transition from the land of dreams Ethereal, bright, Elysian, to the dull And working-day realities of school;â The qualms of sad home-sickness, soon dispell'd By studies and diversions in swift round Alternating, yet still, from time to time, Admitting to the mind's abstracted gaze Bright glimpses of remember'd looks and forms;â These, and ten thousand griefs and joys like these,â Successes, disappointments, hopes fulfill'd, And expectations blighted, friendships form'd And enmities incurr'dâthe good and ill Strangely commix'd and blended, which make up The schoolboy's portionâmust I leave unsung: Yet not without a word of grateful praise And frank acknowledgment of good received, Would I cast off the thought of that old school And all its recollections.âI believe That, not for rudiments of classic lore Alone, or other knowledge ably taught, Do I remain its debtor, but for much Of what is now least blameable, and bad In all my moral Being.âWe were school'd Not by mere pedantsâacademic dolts, With heart and soul all syntax, but by men With hearts and souls of men, who loved to make Their pupils their companions,âate and drank At the same board, and in their presence spoke Of what concern'd themselves.âOf open heart They were, and if the boldness of their speech And humour sometimes overstepp'd the bounds Of clerical decorumâif they seem'd Less strict in their conformity to rules Conventionalâless careful of the shows Which the world's voice exacts of clergymen, Than friends desired, or foes could fail to wishâ There was in them a manliness of soulâ A blunt contempt for the world's hollow forms, And seemings hypocritical, which taught Us also how to think and act like men. The spirit of the masters was, in part, Diffused among the scholars;âwe became Attach'd to them, and to their dwelling-place; Nor less to one another;âand at last, When the time came which summon'd me away For ever, I went forth like one who leaves His native land and kindred:âsad farewells Given and received, and benedictions breathed From no unfervent heartsâpressure of hands, Sad looks and tears that could not be restrain'd, Attended my departure as I pass'd Forth from the door which never more should ope To me as to an inmate. Once again, When near twelve years had pass'd, I saw that house, And spent a day and night beneath its roof, And slept where I had slept, and traced once more Each of my boyhood's haunts.âI scarcely think That now, when others dwell thereânow, when life With me hath reach'd its zenith, and must soon Begin to sink into the vale of years,â I e'er again could find it in my heart There to repeat my visit. But I turn To scenes more famous, nor to me less dear,â Nay dearer, and with feelings more profound And holy in remembrance close entwined;â Birth-place, to me, of poesy and love, Amidst whose classic shades, in after years, Tarrying, I found and woo'd, and proudly won Her who, for sixteen years, hath been the stay And solace of my pilgrimage on earth; The mother of my children, the unchanged, Unwearied partner of my joys and griefs. Fair art thou, with thy crown of ancient towers, Thy cloister'd dim arcades, thy spacious courts, Thy verdant fields and venerable trees, Reflected in the mirror broad and clear Of thy prÃ¦terfluent. Thames.âWith what a calm Proud confidence thou seem'st to nestle close Beneath yon castle's overshadowing wing! As conscious of the loyalty thou lov'st To cherish in thy sons.âWith reverent heart I greet theeânot unmindful of the good For which I am thy debtor; nor, if aught Of evil was mix'd up with it, upbraid Thee and thy noble nurture for a fault In part or all my own.âEtona, hail! And mayst thou flourish ever!âFar removed From thy fair shades, which yet, from year to year, I visit, and with love for ever fresh, And keen enjoyment, wander thro' and thro',â I summon from my heart's sepulchral depths Thy buried image.âRise, as when I first Beheld thee, half expectant, half in fear Of that new world mysterious, unexplored, Within thy walls awaiting me.âFar off I saw theeâthe grey pinnacles and spires Of thy majestic chapel o'er the pile Of dull, brick, massive ivy-mantled towers, Rising in Gothic prideâthy verdant meads Sprinkled with youthful cricketers, and bright With vernal sunshine.âBeautiful thou wast, And with thy loveliest smiles didst welcome me, A stranger, to thy bosom;âyet not then (Albeit a stranger) simple or unversed In all the ways of schoolboys, but with front Bold and defiant, and with spirit prompt To meet, and, if need were, repel the assaults Of tyrannous oppression:âto such pitch Of rude blunt valour had experience, gain'd Through previous buffets, strung me, though in sooth, By nature not a brawler, nor inclined To pugilistic exploit:âbut amidst Thy peaceful dwellings slender need I found Of such heroic daring:âthere, enthroned On meet gradations of ascending ranks, Reign'd Order;âthere, by firmest law secured, Right triumph'd over Might;ânot strength alone, Nor skill to give, nor stubbornness to bear Black eye and bloody nose and bruise uncouth, Won station and respect,ânor kept them, won. A more mysterious, more majestic power Diffused through, and controlling, every rank Of that small commonwealth, was recognised, Felt, and obey'd.âNo robber horde were we, Anarchical, self-will'd, by force alone From mutual wrong and violence restrain'd; But a well-govern'd people, proud to own Legitimate control, and to maintain Our glorious constitution unimpair'd. And what if aristocracy, upheld By right prescriptive, ruled with feudal sway Her unenfranchised vassals,âstill her yoke Was milder and less grievous to be borne Than arbitrary bondage, forced elsewhere By strength of fist, on the reluctant necks Of trembling urchins, all too weak to win The freedom which they sigh'd for.âHard it seem'd, No doubt, on summer evenings, when the Thames Was all alive with skiffs, to toil and pant With infinite expenditure of breath, And reeking limbs and weariness of heart, Fetching and flinging home the volant ball Of some unflagging cricketer:âhard 'twas To rise before the lark, on menial tasks Intent, discharging with one pair of hands The offices of valet, footman, cook, Housemaid, and shoeblack;âpassing hard to spread, Hungry oneself and breakfastless, the board Of some luxurious despot,âhe meanwhile Snoring supine;âand oft would flesh rebel When summon'd by the cry of âLower Boy,â To do the bidding of an autocrat. Yet all such hardships, springing as they did Not from a tyrant's arbitrary will, But from the fix'd authority of law And immemorial custom, were endured With patience, nay with cheerfulness, as ills Essential to the state in which we lived, And not therefrom to be exterminate Without disruption dire of social bonds And urgent danger to the common weal: Transient withal, and soon to be exchanged, In due succession, for the sweets of power. Nor lack'd that state of vassalage its rights And privileges, by the weaker crowd Not to be lightly valued;âsome defence Against oppression,âpatronage and aid In trouble or distress,âassistance lent In toils scholastic:âne'er did thraldom wear A yoke less galling:âstrong attachment oft Grew up between the master and the serf; And each, from the relation held to each, Derived some moral disciplineâwas taught Lessons which else he might have never learnt, Of kindness and forbearance, self-restraint, Submission and obedience.âWould that I, With my rash humour and impetuous blood, Had learnt those lessons better than I did! Swift flew, on pleasure's wings, those early months, The months of my noviciate:âslavery seem'd, (If slave I was) on that enchanted ground, Freer than freedom elsewhere:âI had broke A hundred galling fetters of restraint, For one (and that a light one) on my will Newly imposed:âa mighty change had past Across the spirit of my dream of life. It seem'd as though a new and ampler world Of Being to my vision was disclosed, Or that my soul had burst the embryo bonds Which held it, like the caterpillar, cramp'd, Till then, in grovelling form, to soar aloft On wings of new-born joyance. Now no more Within a playground's narrow bounds confined, Not without peril to be overpass'd,â Fetter'd no more to the despised routine Of sports and occupations which befit The pre-existent state of private school,â My spirit might expatiate, uncontroll'd, Through boundless realms of pleasure:âSpace was freeâ Time only had its limits;âfield and grove, Water and land,âalmost the air itself Lay openâthe whole world before us smiled, Our portion and inheritance! Nor lack'd The energies and faculties within Proportionate development:âour sports, Plans, enterprises, aspirations, aims, Were all of manhood, manly:âtops and taws Were things forgotten;âeven the cricket-ground And fives-court held but secondary rank Among our recreations:âon the breast Of Thames, it was our pride in trim-built skiffs To shoot amainânow singly, now in crews, With lusty tug of oar, in eager race Contending;ânow along the river's marge Exploring unknown regions;âand when June Brought round the birth-day of the good old king, (Our own especial patron,)âwith what pride And pomp aquatic, in procession long, Our galleys clave the water!âwhat wild rout Of horsemen on the banks!âwhat jovial glee Of banqueters!âand when a rocket's blaze, Scattering its fiery spangles on the sky, Gave notice that the ten-oar was in sight, How was each coign of vantageâbank and bridge, Boatyard and terraced garden, wharf and quay, Window and roof, with congregated crowds Of gazers peopled!âwhat sublime display Of pyrotechnic wonders seem'd to mock The all too tardy twilight!âBut even this, For some adventurous spirits, was too dull And spiritless a joy!âSuch burnt to win The sportsman's noble fame, albeit alloy'd By ill report of poacher:âwith the dawn, O'erleaping the restraint of bolts and bars, They ranged, with dog and gun, the near preserves, Or from forbidden waters bore the lines Rich with nocturnal spoil:âthe river swans, Breasting, with snow-white swell of downy plumes, The silvery stream, themselves were not exempt From rude assault, but stricken through and through By murderous volleys, yielded up their lives To daring marksmen; then beneath the shade Of favouring night brought home, and for the spit With pomp of culinary skill prepared, Were roasted and served upâtheir savoury steam Provoking the keen appetities of those Who, like myself, eschewing sportsman craft, Shared not the sportsman's banquet:âon the turf Meanwhile athletic cricketers, for strife With the pick'd champions of some neighbouring club Preparing, plied the bat and drove the ball In lusty sport.âOh! who can e'er forget, When the day fix'd for final conflict came, How breathlessly we rush'd, from school let loose, To view the mighty game!âhow, from afar, Between the umbrageous trees of Poet's walk, The slim white figures of the combatants Glanced on our eager sight!âwith what suspense,â What alternations swift of hope and fear,. We watch'd the progress of the game!âand when On Eton's side the fatal wicket fell, Or aught occurr'd presaging her defeat,â How keen a pang of anguish and dismay Thrill'd through our trembling ranks!âthen, if at last The fortune of the day declared for us,â With what a maddening shout of victory We rent the welkin!âWaterloo itself, (For Waterloo was fought in those wild days) Scarce seem'd a mightier triumph than some match Won against Epsom. But to loftier strains Tune we our harp!âDescend, O Muse, and sing The glories of Long Chamber, ere its name, By march of innovation, from the earth Be, with itself, erased.âEre I became Its denizen, dire tales had reach'd my ear Of horrors by its dreadful walls conceal'd; Of slavery more oppressive than aught known Or e'en imagined by inventive thought, Among the happy dwellers in the town; Of penal torments by no living tongue Divulged, nor e'er, beyond those prison walls, Known or conceived;âmyself the destined thrall Of one the most despotic of a race Of most imperious despots.âTime sped on; The day arrived on which I was to don The gownsman's sable garb,âand after due Examination held, and solemn course Of ceremonial forms, on bended knee Observed with silent awe, night saw me housed Beneath that dreaded roof.âIt was an hour Not soon to be forgotten.âAmidst sounds Discordant, multifarious,âsong and shout,â Imperious summons and responsive cry Reciprocal of master and of slave,â And long shrill whistle through the darkness heardâ (Darkness scarce pierced by the thin glimmering light Of candle, here and there its feeble ray Emitting through the interminable gloom Of that long spectral vault,)âwith heart perplex'd, I sought my destined resting-place:âbut where Might resting-place be found?âforlorn I gazed On all that endless row of bedsteads rude, Each bearing what appear'd a mattress coarse, Cover'd by coarser rug, alternating With rude mis-shapen semblance of bureaus, Square, upright, with cerulean paint bedaub'd,â (Cerulean once, now with ten thousand hues Distain'd)âsole furniture in that grim den, Save tapestry of cobwebs, which had seen The days of the sixth Henry,âhere in threads Of gossamer dependent from the roof, There curtaining, with folds of filmy mist, The smash'd and flapping casements:âchair was none; No, not a three-legg'd stool, nor oaken bench, Nor aught which ingenuity of need Might mould into a seat;âno separate nook, Withdrawn and shelter'd from the public gaze, Where the poor novice might brief refuge find From tumult and bewilderment;âall seem'd A maze of restless motion:âbut ere long From out that weltering chaos was evolv'd A world distinct and orderly;âthe din And hubbub had subsided;âlights appear'd Forth starting in succession;âbeds arranged By nice precision of experienced hands, Were ready, at the apartment's upper end, For rest luxurious of aristocrats, Who, in their studies pent, or far apart In separate chambers, with each other held Exclusive converse, or with book and pen Beguiled the lingering hours:âthe middle ranks, In pairs or cluster'd groups, paced to and fro, Or lounged on unmade beds:âthe vulgar herd (Their menial service done) in haste arranged Their own hard pallets, pillowless, and soon Sank into dreamless sleep,âsome six or eight Alone excepted, from the rest in turn For servitorial functions, week by week, Selected, on the lordly board to spread The nightly meal, and do the high behests Of sixth-form revellers;âto each his task Duly prescribed, as academic rank Defined his office;âsome, the upper mess, (So named) above the rest pre-eminent, Brought from the neighbouring buttery meat and bread, With foaming cans of beer;âto some 'twas given To tend the nightly fire, and in their gowns (Ne'er meant for such base service) to bring home A ponderous load of coals, upon their backs Artistically piled;âsome, clerkly-wise, Noted, on tablets fair, with pen and ink The mandates of their lords,âby one, who watch'd Outside our prison bars, to be convey'd Into the farthest town, and thence evoke Luxurious freightage of nocturnal cheer. It were a work o'ertasking my poor strength To tell of half the feats within those walls Nightly perform'd;âto paint the winter fire, By signal of the clock at half-past nine, Fenced round with bedsteads, for the middle ranks Forming a snug enclosure, within which, Story, and song, and jest, and laugh went round, Till bed-time came;âto tell how, many an hour, While our proud seniors half the livelong night Conversed, until the embers died away, We lay awake and listen'd to their talk, Now serious, now jocose,âwith classic lore, Or speculation philosophical, Sometimes enrich'd,âsometimes with baser stuff Degraded and defiled;âand how, on nights Of revelry, when coolest brains grew hot With wine and wassail, we, in trembling dread, Beneath our bedclothes cower'd, till (every light Quench'd suddenly) in mad, tyrannic sport, Bedstead and bed, hurl'd suddenly aloft, Dislodged their luckless tenant, in dire plight, Heels upward on the floor.âBut these were rare And soon forgotten hardships:âother sports More genial, nor exclusively enjoy'd By the patrician few, from time to time Cheer'd our imprisonment:âin motley form Of merry masquerade, our mirth full oft Broke loose and ran mad riot:âHigh and low, With Saturnalian licence, burst their bonds Conventional, and gamboll'd out the night In frolic unrestrain'd:âsometimes arose, (As by strange magic of Aladdin's lamp,) A theatre, complete in all its parts, With marvellous diversity of scene And gorgeous decorations, and bright blaze Of cunningly disposed and countless lights, Embellishing the histrionic craft Of our Collegian Roscii:ânor, in sooth, Lack'd we or comic humour, or, at times, Some touch of natural pathos:âand, if these E'er flagg'd, rich compensation still we found In our grotesque apparel:â'twas a sight Worthy of more fastidious eyes than oursâ That motley pageant of fantastic garbs Assembled in our green-room;âboyhood's limbs Robed in the grave habiliments of age;â The corpulent round paunch of monk or friar,â The rustic with red mass of hair unkempt, Smock frock, and scarlet hose, and nether vest Of buckskin, begg'd or borrow'd, for the nonce, E'en from the haunch of veritable clownâ And, (stranger, more fantastic than all else) The garb, shape, face, and voice of womanhood, Aped by some beardless boyâhis burly waist Mocking the close imprisonment of stays; His bust by cunning artifice swoln out To feminine proportions, and his brow O'ershadow'd by profusion, rich and rare, Of borrow'd ringlets, while with mincing gait Affected, and his voice's tenor pipe Reduced to a shrill treble, he assumed The gestures of a maidenâby applause Obstreperous of the congregated crowd Not scantily rewarded.âAll alike, Actors and audience, willing both to please And to be pleased, received and gave, by turns, Reciprocal enjoyment;âwell I wot None such was ever felt in Drury Lane! And was this Eton?âin no better lore Than this doth she instruct the ripening mind, And train the expanding heart?âNay, deem not so, But, in the lengthening retrospect of years, The sports and conflicts of the schoolboy world,â Its microcosmic cares, and joys, and griefs,â The daily intercourse of boy with boy,â Appear the true realities;âall else, Which, when 'twas present, seem'd important, now Looks dim and dwindled:âeven the daily task,â The weekly verses,âthe whole grave routine Of studies, with their prizes and rewards,â Seem insignificant, minutest spots In memory's landscape, which the limner's touch Passes unnoticed.âYet, among my peers, (Albeit no sleepless student,) I enjoy'd A scholar's reputation, nor disdain'd The accomplishment of verse;âand now, methinks, Amidst those preludings of boyish thought And those young classic studies, I discern The germs of much, which, growing with my growth, And strengthen'd with my strength, hath since become A portion of my Being.âIf my song Hath ever found its way to gentle hearts,â 'Twas by the nurture and development Of dormant powers, then first and only found, That its wild notes were fashion'd to express A natural tenderness.âTo me, no tale Of martial prowess, or renown'd exploit, By poet or historian told of yore, Was e'er attractive;âlittle, in my heart, Responded to the burst of trumpet blast, Or host with host conflicting;âbut I loved ('Twas the first poetry I ever felt) That ode of Horace, which relates the doom Of Hypermnestra, daring bonds and death, For her young bridegroom's sake,âand Ovid's tale Of grief domestic, that heart-breaking night Appointed for his exile:âI admired, With most intense and earnest sympathy, Alcestis' self-devotion, and rejoiced With an exceeding joy, when Hercules Restored her from the grave to life and bliss And his embraces for whose sake she died. Among such images of household love My fancy fondly revell'd, and my heart Responded to my fancy.âI ne'er form'd An abstract scheme of bliss, which was not based On the calm comfort of a home and hearth Surrounded by bright faces rich with love Connubial and parental.âBounteous Heaven, Exceeding whatsoever hope pourtray'd, Or young imagination fondly dream'd, Hath given me more than all my boyish heart E'er sigh'd for.âFancy's picture-world is now To me less glorious than reality. But my brain teems with spectral forms of thought Evoked from sleep sepulchralâlong withdrawn From the mind's eye, but unforgotten still And fresh as heretofore.âI must perforce Disperse the wildering vision.âFair retreat,â Thou cradle of my boyish phantasy,â Farewell!âwith deep and undiminish'd love I cherish thy remembrance, and rejoice That o'er thy courts a brighter day hath risen Than my young eyes beheld;âfor thou hast felt The impulse of the spirit now awake In the deep bosom of thy mother Church, And, strong in thy re-animated faith, Art, as I trust, become a schoolmistress To bring young hearts to Christ.âBeneath thy towers Religion, long obscured, once more uplifts Her venerable head,ânot now disguised And sore degraded by low-mutter'd charm Of Latin prayers, which, with indecent haste, Impatient urchins gabbled, unreproved By teachers as impatientâbut infused Into the fountains and fresh springs of thought, And mingling her pure essence with its stream, Which widens as it flows. Nor let me grieve (Though haply there be cause of real grief) For old associations, soon to pass Into the number of the things that were,â When even Long Chamber from the world's wide face Shall have been swept for ever.âBe its sins (Not few, nor venial) with its joys forgot; And may a better generation find At least no meaner shelter where it stood! I have a friendâalmost the only one Who, from our schoolboy days to life's full noon, Hath kept his heart unchanged and true to me, Though many a year hath past since last we met, And more may pass before we meet again;â One friendâalmost one onlyâfaithful found. To him, in distant vales a sojourner, Far in the pleasant south, I now commend (What to my children hath already been With dedication more express consign'd) This songâbrief record of those early days In which we were companions.âDifferent cares And sympathies have gather'd around each; And yet, I think, if e'er we meet again, We shall not feel estranged;âmeanwhile to him And those who love him, though to me unknown, Be this my pledge of boyish vows unbroke, And friendship by the world as yet unchill'd. BOOK III. YOUTH. INSCRIBED TO DERWENT COLERIDGE. âThe youth who daily farther from the East Must travel, still is Nature's priest, And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended.â Wordsworth. With Friendship's sacred name my song broke off;â With Friendship's sacred name shall it resume Its onward course,ânot now on boyish sports, And boyish cares intent, but borne along (If from its subject it may yet receive A kindred impulse) by the swelling flood Of youthful passion through the veins diffused, And vigorous thought new-born, and hope unquench'd By sad experience, lighting up the eye With gleams which seem propheticâand are not. Friend, whom in Granta's academic halls First met, soon lovedâthenceforward to my side Fast bound by poesy's free-masonry And mutual veneration for a name To me most sacred, and by thee beloved With all a son's affectionâFriend, who now These more than twenty years, with thy profound And fervent spirit, hast supported mine,â Transferring whatsoe'er can be transferr'd From thy rich depths of intellectual wealth Into this lighter and more sterile soil, Which yields but scant return;âto thee this strain, A monument to long departed youth, I consecrate:âTo whom indeed on Earth If not to thee, my earliest Poet-friend, Should song of mine be offer'd?âWho but thou, With earnest converse and assiduous zeal Of sympathy,âneglectful of the gift On thee more richly lavish'd,âfann'd in me The spark of youthful phantasy?âto whom, If not to thee, is due on my behalf A debt of deepest gratitude for all That, in time past, my soul hath ever felt Of hope and joy poetic?âSmall indeed The fruit of all thy culture:âthose long years Of absence, during which we lived and wrought In distant vineyards, seem'd to wither up Whate'er brief promise of more healthful song Thy care had caused to germinate;âand now,â When Providence once more hath brought us near Each to the other,â'tis too late to call Lost seasons back:âbut I have deeper debts To thee than such as these, and there are bonds More sacred, knitting fast thy heart to mine, Than even the electric chain of phantasy:â Warm sympathies cementing each with each In joys and sorrows of the world that is;â Remembrances, now sweet, of conflicts once Most bitter, but at length with triumph crown'd, And still imparting to our noon of life Its best of earthly joys;âthe mutual love Of those respectively beloved by both Beyond all else that breathes;âand (more than all) Our hope in worlds to comeâour task in this; For we are, both, ambassadors for Christ, And thou high honour'd in His English Church Among her theologians;âin thyself, No meanly skill'd expounder of her creed,â Nor worthy of less honour, for that thou Interpretest the mystic mind of One, The mightiest thinker of these latter days. For such, thy late achievementsâhow much more Than for whate'er of high philosophy Or art poetic, in our youthful days, I from thy lips derivedâam I become Thy glad and grateful debtor.âThou alone, With stedfast gaze intent, hast well discern'd, Through all the mists of error which bedim Her heavenly features, the true spouse of Christ:â Not that stern phantom, which, on Isis banks, Enthusiasts have beheld, and in devout And abject error worshipp'dâa severe And loveless idol, from men's sympathies And craving hearts estranged,âin garb of power And terrible authority array'd,â O'erbearing Reason's clear uplifted voice With frown dogmatic, and converting Faith Itself into a blind credulity Most slavish and idolatrous;ânot such The vision thou hast seen, nor (falser yet) That hard-eyed spectre, by the will of man Engender'd,âaltogether of the earth And earthy,âwhich the laws of human realms Create, and can at pleasure uncreate. Not this,ânot such as this, the Church of Christ, Seen and with master hand pourtray'd by thee,â But one, who on her fair and ample brow Bears the bright impress of Divinity;â No step-dame, but a mother of brave sons With all a mother's heart,âthe nurse and guide Of Faith and Reason,âof celestial Truth The guardian and the witness.âIn thy page, Well reason'd, pregnant with profoundest thought, I, an unworthy student, seem to hold Communion with thy spirit afar off; And sitting at thy feet, as I was wont In earlier days, with willing mind imbibe Instruction which makes smooth the way to death. We are alone:ânone other now on Earth Shares our full bond of friendship.âOne there was, Beloved by both, and who repaid our love As only natures of the purest mould Repay the love of others.âFull two years Have past since we consign'd him to the grave In life's unripen'd prime,âand still it seems As if we could not think of him as dead;â The immortality which dwelt in him So swallow'd up the mortal.âYet 'tis true, âThe good die first;â and his celestial part Was purged so nearly of all earth's alloy, That 'twere, in us, most selfish to have wish'd That he would tarry in our homes of clay. Yet few there were, perchance, but thou and I, And one,âhis own by more especial ties,â One fondlier cherish'd in his heart of hearts,â Few but we three, who knew the wondrous depths Of that mysterious spirit.âTo the world He veil'd, beneath a smooth and smiling brow, Its fathomless abyss,âwith flippant jest, And poignant sarcasm, and sly equivoque, And many a coruscation, bright though brief, Of wit, and humour more akin than wit To geniusâdrawing off intrusive eyes From that intensity of human love And that most deep and tender sympathy Close guarded in the chambers of his heart. His generation knew him not;âhe seem'd To worldly men a trifler,âand when years, Correcting the rash fervour of his youth, Taught him to honour much which once he scorn'd, And guard what he had panted to o'erthrowâ Men deem'd such seeming fickleness the fruit Of falsehood or caprice, and factious tongues Were busy to defame him:âhe, meanwhile, Through honour and dishonour, through report Evil and good,âby rash, misjudging men Accounted a deceiver, though most true And strong in his integrity,âmaintain'd His course unalter'd, and in vain assail'd By obloquy and slander.âDeath hath nipp'd His promise in the bud, or he had rank'd Among our noblest statesmen, and perchance Proved to the Church, in this distracted realm, Her ablest champion in her utmost need. As such let Her bewail him!âbut to us He leaves a deeper sorrow;âCan that hour E'er pass away from memory, when we two With that highminded lady, hand in hand Knelt by his coffin, till her deeper grief At last found vent in tears, and we conversed Of him, and what he was, and what he is, In words of solemn calmness?âor that morn, When, one by one, into the room of death, Hung with funereal black, the mourners stole,â A sad and silent crowd, by various ties, Public and private, join'd to him in life,â All grieving for him dead.âThe statesman there Forgot the war of factions, nor refused To his untimely loss some natural tears;â The pale-eyed scholar side by side was seen With men of wordy strife, who for a day Suspended their forensic rivalries To weep upon his grave;âthe merchant left His counting-house,âand friends who had not met For many a year before, met there to mourn A nobler friend than all.âShe too, his ownâ His almost more than wife, (if more there be In this cold world), regardless of the laws Of tyrant custom, came with tearless eye And brow erect, though pale almost as his, To give him to the grave:âthrough busy streets Slowly and sadly moved the funeral train, Until within the cemetery gates At length it halted, and the solemn words Of our sublimest ritual rendered back Dust to its dustâthe spirit to the hands Of Him who gave it:âpainful to the ear Was that dull, grinding, subterraneous sound Of some unseen machinery, which, with slow Scarce visible descent, received the Dead Into the opening bosom of the earth; And deep the desolation which oppress'd Our spiritsâthe dejection which we felt, When we (the three who loved and mourn'd him most) Together bent our steps into the vault To bid our last farewell.âBetween long rows Of dead, each coffin'd in its separate niche, Tier above tierâa subterranean vault Of sepulchresâwe walk'd, until we came To his dark narrow home;âthe charnel gusts Smote close and chill,âour tread, with hollow sound, Fell echoing, till (the wholesome upper air And cheerful light of day once more regain'd) With aching hearts we parted, to renew Our troubled Dream of Life. A dream indeed,â A feverish waking dreamâmore shadowy still The longer that it lasts!âWhate'er in youth Seem'd real, ere our middle age arrives, Even like a phantom vanishes away, Or crumbles in our grasp.âOur life itselfâ Which once appear'd as if 'twould never endâ Is found to be a shadow, soon to flit Away, and be forgotten;âeven the schemesâ The air-built castles of our early daysâ That vigorous hope with which we look'd abroad Into the opening worldâthat confidence In the bright-seeming future, by no fear Of change or chance diminish'dâwere in truth More tangible possessions in themselves Than the realities of later life. And such were thine and mine when first we met (A freshman thou, and I a junior soph,) In the Old Court at King's. Unlike, till then, Had been our several nurtures, each to each; Thou, from thy birth, a hardy mountaineer, A poet's child, thyself a Poet born, And cradled among minds of giant mould, Hadst, almost with thy mother's milk, imbibed Philosophy, which with thy growth had grown, And with thy strength been strengthen'd:âin the northâ A wanderer among lakes and mighty hillsâ Scarce conscious e'en of such restraint as curbs The southern schoolboyâthou hadst kept unstain'd Thy spirit's freshness and simplicity; And, in thy native strength of intellect, O'erleaping the strait bounds of puny thought Which circumscribed the realm in which we moved, (Weak jinglers of hexameters,) could'st breathe In worlds beyond our ken;âI, train'd and taught In academic craft, and, for my feats Poetic, with Etonian laurel crown'dâ A schoolboy bard, with schoolboy lore imbued, And thinking like a schoolboyâwhat was I, That I should match with thee?âyet match'd we were, If not in genius, yet in sympathy; Each reverencing what the other reverencedâeach Still loving whatsoe'er the other loved; Our hopes, our aspirations, our desires, Our plans and projects for the years to come, Akin, if not identical:âthe world As yet was all before usâthe young blood Ran riot in our veins,âwe felt our life Strong, buoyant, full of hopeâand we were free To âframeâ whate'er âhigh purposesâ we would Of intellectual enterprise, âat war With fleshly shame;ââso sang thy muse to mine, Who tuned her chords responsive.âWhat more blest Could either of us wish, than to pursue Together the green paths of poesy, And cultivate the fair domains of thought Which nature had assign'd us? Of renown And rank among our country's sons of song Methinks we dream'd but little:âfame was not Our idol, nor the prize for which we strove. Our phantasy should be its own reward; Or if we needed other, that should be The love of woman:âwe would pitch our tent In some sequester'd valley, and there dwellâ We and two gentle beings, who would link Their lot with ours, and in our arms repose, And, with serene and fervent sympathy Sharing and sweetening all our toils and cares, Diffuse perpetual sunshine through our souls, Which, by that warmth impregnated, should teem With most abundant growth of noble thoughts And lofty speculations, and rich store Of sweet and bitter fancies.âDreams like these At times beguiled us, but our daily talk Was of more serious matter;âof the laws Which govern the mysterious heart of man;â Of dogmas transcendental, to my ear A theme, till then unknown, though long to thee Familiar, and with earnest zeal explored;â Of all the wild and wondrous world of song, And those who hold its empireâchiefly Him The myriad-minded;ânor were they forgot, The mighty masters of our later day, And Him their CoryphÃ¦us, then not yet Enthroned, as now, on England's inmost heart, But by a few (the true poetic Church, As they esteem'd themselves) with earnest zeal And somewhat of a fond idolatry Revered, nay, almost worshipp'd.âWith such themes Were mingled yet profounder;âTruth divine Reveal'd to erring manâRedemptive love, In all its breadth, and length, and depth, and height, By thee with theologic gaze intent Contemplated;âand if from the routine Of academic study we diverged Too oft, and were forgetful of the claims Of curves and squares, and parallelograms, Cones, angles, sines and cosines, ordinates, AbscissÃ¦, and the likeâmethinks, our time, Though sore mispent, was yet not wholly lost In converse such as this. Not wholly lostâ And yet my loss was grievous;ânot perchance So much for the amount of actual lore Neglected, or of science unattain'd, As for the loss of discipline incurr'd, Moral and intellectual,âself-control, And self-denial,âpatience in pursuit Of knowledge,âperseverance to surmount Impedimentsâand firmness to withstand Temptation, unacquired.âIf I am now Too much an idlerâprone to leave undone My daily task of ministerial toil, And loiter in my study o'er some page Of theologic triflingâor forsake Even that for lighter reading such as charm'd My young imaginationâto those strolls In part I owe it, which, from day to day, We two were wont to take, in hours by right To academic study set apart. Pleasant they were, and pleasant was the talk By which they were beguiled;âto me oft rich In knowledge newly gain'd.âWe walk'd and walk'd As chance directedâby the river side To Granchesterâalong the lanes which lead To Cherry Hintonâout by Trumpingtonâ And Madingley, sole village from the plague Of ugliness, in that drear land, exempt: The Gogmagogs were conscious of our talk; And I may say that seldom I came home No wiser than I went.âBut in the days Of early spring, when even those treeless fields Look'd pleasant in the sunshine, and the lanes With constellations of bright primrose tufts Were here and there bestudded,âwhen the scent Of the cinque-spotted cowslip was exhaled From the low meadow grass,âand in the woods The nightingale (more fitly heard by night) Sang lustily all dayâwith what a bound Of vernal exultation forth we sprang Into the clear, fresh air!âhow recklessly, Spurning the narrow bounds of space and time, We rambled in the ways of our own hearts And sight of our own eyes!âwith what dispatch Of keen and craving hunger we assail'd Our mid-day luncheon in the village in, Served haply by the fair domestic hands Of her, the maid of Quyâthat saint whose shrine By many a Cantabrigian pilgrimage, (By none more zealous or more pure than ours) Was, in those days, frequented!âthen at eve, As, homeward bound, through the suburban streets We wended in grotesque and careless guiseâ The very tassels of our trencher caps With cowslips interlaced,âhow cheap we held The laughter of the mob!âhow little fear'd The frown of Dean or Proctor!âthen our meal Together shared,âthe savoury steak sent hot From the cook's shopâthe amber-flowing ale Of Trinity,âthe spare dessert,âthe wine With olives relish'dâand our day's discourse Prolong'd till midnight!âCollege life alone Can boast such joys as these. Nor let me pass Unsung, those nights and suppers of the godsâ Feasts of the hungry soul, when, at the close Of some well argued, eloquent debate Held in the âUnion,â which with lengthen'd roar Of cheers had shaken Petty Cury's roofs, Startling the jaded shopman from his sleep,â The leaders of the war on either side, (Their strife suspended) to my neighbouring rooms Adjourn'd, to sup on oysters.âAid me now, O Muse, to tell who first, who last engaged In those keen conflicts of contending wit And appetite as keen;âwho (since renown'd In senatorial or forensic war) From their first proof and exercise of arms Offensive and defensive, came to wield Less cumbrous weapons in colloquial sport, At those repasts, with us. First, He whose praise This song already, though in feeble notes, Unworthily, hath sungâhe, then a youth Fresh from Etonian discipline, well skill'd In all her classic craft, and therewithal Known, ere his sun in Granta's sky arose, For many a boyish feat, unlike a boy's, Of sparkling prose and verse,âhe graced our board With that rich vein of fine and subtle witâ That tone of reckless levityâthat keen And polish'd sarcasmâarm'd with which he waged A war of dexterous sword-play, wherein few Encounter'd, none o'ercame him:âby his side Sat One of ampler brow and ruder frame,â A presence with gigantic power instinct, Though outwardly, in truth, but little graced With aught of manly beautyâshort, obese, Rough-featured, coarse complexion'd, with lank hair, And small grey eyes,âin face (so many said) Not much unlike myself,âhis voice abrupt, Unmusical;âyet, when he spake, the ear Was charm'd into attention, and the eye Forgot the visible and outward frame Of the rich mind within; with such swift flow Of full, spontaneous utterance the tongue Interpreted the deep impassion'd thought, And pour'd upon our sense exhaustless store Of multifarious learning;âfor his mind Had been, from earliest childhood up to youth, Insatiable of knowledge, and his brain,â Not like a pedant's, cumber'd and confused With ill-digested, heterogeneous hoards Of intellectual matter, but endued With power to shape and mould its gather'd wealth As need suggested,âturn'd, with ready tact, Its huge artillery on whatever point It pleased him to assail,âand (sooth to say) He was not over-scrupulous;âto him There was no pain like silenceâno constraint So dull as unanimity:âhe breathed An atmosphere of argument, nor shrank From making, where he could not find, excuse For controversial fight:âyet when the fit Was off him, and he gave his mind free scope To follow Nature's biddingâwho so full Of genial thought and feeling?âwho so keen To separate truth from errorâto detect The fallacy in specious terms involved, Or in the realms of Fiction to discern The beautiful and just?âHe was, in truth, (So transcendental sages would affirm) The king of Understandingâunapproach'd, Unrivall'd in his own particular range Of thought;âand if that range was not the firstâ If there were regions into which his gaze Pierced notâan intuition more profound Than he affectedâsuch deficiency Found ample compensation in the strength And full perfection of his actual powers, And the quick tact which wielded them.âMeanwhile His heart was pure and simple as a child's, Unbreathed on by the world,âin friendship warm, Confiding, generous, constant; and though now He ranks among the great-ones of the earth, And hath achieved such glory, as will last To future generationsâhe, I think, Would sup on oysters with as right good will In this poor home of mine, as e'er he did On Petty Cury's classical first floor Some twenty years ago. With him in bonds Of mutual friendship link'dâin classic lore His equal, though of less voracious maw, And slower to digest what he devour'd Of intellectual foodâappear'd a youth Of comeliest presence, though of brow, perchance, Less lofty and projecting than the brain Beneath it would have taught phrenologists To look for in its owner:âgrave he was, And prone to silence; and whene'er he spake, 'Twas with a slow, sententious utterance, As if each word that dropp'd was first well weigh'd, And licensed to go forth;âhis manner shy And somewhat puritanical;âyet none Possess'd a mind with richer humour fraught, Or saw, with so acute and quick a glance, The ludicrous in all things:ânot in vain He woo'd the Museâwith no ungraceful steps Walk'd through the land of Fancy in its length And in its breadth; but with more earnest love He sought profounder lore:âhis mind severe, Patient, exact, with most tenacious grasp Held fast, and grappled with, and overcame Whate'er of difficult impediment Beset his path to knowledge;ânor was truth, Thus hardly won, less resolutely kept. The rash vagaries of erratic thought And venturous speculation, which seduced More sanguine minds, ne'er raised a doubt in his, Nor shook the deep foundations of his faith Even for a moment.âNow, a learned man, In professorial chair he holds his state Didactic, and with classic lore imbues Another generation. Turn we next To one but rarely, on those nights, our guest;â To himâthy kinsman, once my schoolfellow, And more than most of my compeers at school, Or thy collateral kindred, to us both By close-knit bonds united;âin those days A comely youth, though prematurely grey, And long ere manhood's noon upon his brow To wear the stainless silver of old age. Graceful he was in person and in mind, Enrich'd with classical accomplishments, And stores of various studyâapt to learn, And with intense susceptibility Of soul and sense endued. Some deem'd him proud, And in himself too confident.âIn truth, 'Twas not his nature to dissemble powers With which he had been gifted, nor the lore To which he had attain'd; and envious men, Who hated him for both, were prompt to blame That which they could not imitate:âyet few Were cast by nature in a finer mould, Or arm'd with apprehensions more Ã¦cute, And exquisite of beauty and of truth, Moral and intellectual. To create Was not his province; but his mind received, And treasured, and retain'd, with ready tact, The lessons by profounder minds instill'd, Which, with expressive utterance, to the taste And apprehensions of the world at large He skilfully adapted.âHence his task Was rightly chosen, when, in after years, He to the teaching of that Master Mind Subjected his whole soulâcontent to share The glory which must rest, in time to come, On those outpourings of immortal thought By his sole pen preserved, or by his toil Collected and arranged. His was, in truth, A proud and happy lot, to have imbibed Those lessons, while he lived, and after death To link his own remembrance with the name Of Earth's profoundest Teacher:âhappier still In that his toils were sweeten'd and sustain'd By such rich treasure of connubial wealth As few have e'er possess'd. Not mine the task To seize and fix the ethereal lineaments Of that majestic spirit, which illumed With rays intense of intellectual light, Corporeal beauty far surpassing aught That to the painter's, or the poet's eye, Imagination ever yet reveal'd Of loveliness idealâwhile the heart, Unchill'd and unsophisticate, still throbb'd With woman's deepest loveâstill sympathized With whatsoe'er of human joy or grief Demands or merits sympathyâstill shared, With unaffected, frank simplicity, The interests and the cares, the healthful sports, The mingled smiles and tears, which mark the course Of ordinary lifeâsuggesting thus, To the discerning and observant mind, How far inventive phantasy falls short Of Nature's actual handiwork!ânot nowâ Not in such strains as these, be her high praise Attempted;ânor let step of mine invade, With reckless tread, the still, sepulchral gloom Which shrouds her recent sorrow.âFor the Deadâ For Him, the gentle and the pure of heart, The generous, the affectionateâfrom Earth At life's full noon removedâfor him, be tears Of true and reverential sorrow shed!â For Herâwhat more can sympathy desire Than those divinest gifts already hers?â Patience and faith to bear the will of Heaven, And power, while yet on earth, to breathe in worlds Of pure celestial thought, and cheering hope Of future bliss, and memory of the Past, To soothe the o'erburden'd Present. Next appear'd, In that superb array of noble minds, A pale, spare man, of high and massive brow, Already furrow'd with deep lines of thought And speculative effortâgrave, sedate, And (if the looks may indicate the age) Our senior some few years:âno keener wit, No intellect more subtle, none more bold Was found in all our host; none deeplier fraught With stores of various learning;âbut, in him, Imagination, fancy, feeling, taste, And reverential faith and fervent zeal Were overlaid by huge incumbent weight Of understandingâso, of late, definedâ The faculty which judgeth after sense. With poesy and poets still he waged Relentless warâdeeming all such, in sooth, Mere cumberers of the ground, or haply worseâ Despisers of plain truthâmad mountebanks, Who led the minds of simple folk astray By their fantastic juggleries, and drown'd The voice of reason with their jingling rhymes. Such craft to him was hateful;âTruth alone, Truth tangible and palpable;âsuch truth As might be weigh'd and measured,âtruth deduced By logical conclusion, close, severe, From premises incontrovertibleâ This was the mistress of his fond desireâ His first, his only love;âof aught more fair Or wonderful he dream'd not;ânought to him Existed, in the whole wide world of thought, Save what could be defined, mapp'd out, survey'd, Adjusted to his liking;âto his eye, Whatever was ideal, seem'd untrue: The hopes which he profess'd of earthly good Were limited to that which he could see, Hear, taste, or feelâeaseâpleasureâall the joys Which wait on wealthâthe exercise and use Of intellect:âin all things he appear'd A strict utilitarian;âyet the Man Was nobler than his creed, and though he mock'd At things, which, to us poets, seem'd almost The breath of human lifeâromantic loveâ Chivalrous honourâpatriotic zealâ And loyal self-devotionâthere were times When even these very themes would kindle up The better soul within, and he became, Unconsciously, the enthusiast he despised. Courteous he was and gentle, even to those Whose intellectual rank beneath his own Lay lowest,âand remembrance, looking back Through twenty years, still rests upon his name, As on a pleasant thought. Unlike him far In characterâin intellect no less, The pair that follows; for a pair in heart So closely join'd, so comely each in form, My song must not divorce;âthe first, a youth, Tall, graceful, well-proportion'd, noble-mien'd, Tho' something in his air might have been thought Almost effeminate,âthe look of one Who, delicately nurtured, ne'er had felt The shocks and buffets which the world inflicts Even on our boyish years;âand such, indeed, Had been his earlier lot, for he was born Heir of a wealthy house, and, from his birth To dawning manhood, in luxurious ease And careless affluence rear'd;âhis mind untrain'd By any rigorous disciplineâunstored With much of school-boy learningâill prepared (So men might think) to face the frowning world And grapple with adversity;âand yet, When fortune changedâas in a moment's time She did, and hurl'd him from his pinnacle Of prosperous expectation down almost To a despised estateâno strongest mind E'er bore such fall more bravely:âeven like one Who estimates this world at its true worth, And, loving not its treasures while they last, Laments them not departedâhe address'd His spirit to its destiny with firm And tranquil equanimityâcontent To do and suffer all the will of Heaven In his appointed sphere.âAnd, to speak truth, Tho' wealth and this world's smiles had pass'd away, Still, in the costliest treasure Earth can yield, He was most rich;âfor one confiding heart Still clave to him with woman's deepest love, And pour'd into his wounds (if wounds he had) The balm of its affection. She was oneâ (That gentle maid)âa foreigner by birth, Of humbler fortunes, who had loved him long, But never told her love; for while the world Look'd bright around him, and the proudest dames Grew prouder in his smile, she durst not lift Her heart so high as to indulge a hope That he would think of her; but when his lot Was darken'd, and the frivolous, false crowd Deserted himâO then what rapturous hope Thrill'd through her bosom, that his loss might prove Her gain,âand she, who never could have shared His prouder, might console his humbler lot, And shed upon his path the tender light Of her devoted love! Ere I threw off The purple gown of Trinity, to don The graduate's sable garb, their wedding day Arrived, and I remember how they came, A happy bride and bridegroom, to rebuke In our own courts, or haply to stir up To emulation of their better lot Our Academic celibate. But Heâ The friend so like a brotherâin what nook Lies he conceal'd?âhe should not be ashamed, Methinks, to shew his face; for few have seen A fairer one on earth;âthe Nireus he Of all our host, though rarely in this field A combatant,âno man of wordy strife, Or wrangling disputation, but best pleased With mild discourse and thought contemplative, And the luxurious witcheries of art:â Himself a poet born, and, from a child, With all a poet's sensibilities, Even to excess endued:âfor him, a boy, The boisterous sports of boyhood were too rough,â The sympathy of schoolfellows too coarse, Save of some few like-minded with himself, With whom he roam'd apartâto all the rest A by-word and a laughing-stock;ânow climb'd Some favourite hillânow ranged the vernal woods In search of wild-flowers.âWith advancing youth Such weakness had worn off, and though he still Retain'd a woman's beauty, manly thought Was his, and manly feeling.âStill the paths Of quiet contemplationâthe wild haunts Of phantasyâand the mysterious realms Of painting and of music were his choice,â The world in which his spirit loved to dwell; And, I believe, no truer eye than his, No finer ear for concord of sweet sounds, No spirit more susceptible of pain Or pleasure from the spells of either art, Or their diviner sister Poesy, Was found, that day, among us. Years have since Develop'd, and expanded, and matured His intellectual strength:âthrough many a field Of art, of science, of philosophy, With firm and fearless step, he walks at will; A bold, adventurous thinker, but withal In heart and hope a Christian. Last appears In this long muster-roll, One o'er whose mind Majestic, deep, imaginative, pure From aught of worldly taint, which might debase Or mar its noble energies, the Muse Laments as lost;âby what mysterious bane Of physical or mental malady Disorder'd, none can tell; but so o'erthrown, That genius, learning, wisdom, the rich gift Of song, on none, in these our later days, More bountifully lavish'd, have, in him, Become a shapeless wreck.âMay brighter days Arise on that dark waste, and heavenly light, Piercing its spectral gloom, create anew The wondrous world beneath it! But 'tis time To change this lengthen'd scene, and bid farewell To all its passing phantoms, though the mind Still grasps them with a fond tenacity. Not all in vain,ânot all in vain,âI trust, O Granta, though thy wild and wayward son, And little heedful of the lore which thou Best lov'st to teach thy childrenânot in vain Spent I the spring and seed-time of my youth Beneath thy reverend towers;âno slender gain I count it to have known whom I have known, And with the noblest spirits of my day Beheld the dawn of manhood;ânot ill timed My sojourn in thy courtsâfor 'twas my lot To know a generation nobler far Than that which went before itâmore athirst For knowledgeâmore intent on loftiest schemes And purposes of goodâand if more prone To daring speculation,âapt to tread More venturous pathsâyet purer from the stain Of gross and sensual viceâwhich among those, Our predecessors in the steep ascent Of academic honour, still had been, Too oft, allied with genius. 'Twas the note And token of a scholar, in their day, To be a jocund reveller,âto spend The night in mad carousals,âthen, perchance, (The wineflush still upon the burning brow,) To reel into the lecture-room;ânot such Our follyâthough our follies were not few, Nor all innocuousâfor the springs of thought Had then been newly stirr'dâand Truth, who since Hath claim'd and won her old supremacy, Was still at war with error, not, as now, Unveil'd and understood. The scene is changed; The towers and courts of Granta disappear With all that they containâand lo, instead, Green trees, and spacious lawns, and shrubbery-walks Umbrageous, amidst which is dimly seen A shelter'd dwelling, with thick-clustering vine And intermingled ivy overgrown. In front, not two miles off, majestic spires Shoot up their tapering outline;âon the left A castle frowns, with massive towers antique Cresting a gentle eminence;âhard by The Severn, scarce yet navigable, rolls Its watersâand blue undulating hills Sweep round the dim horizon.â'Tis a scene On which a poet's eye may rest well pleased; Nor lacks it such inspection.âFrom yon house Even now two youthful brethren of the lyre Look forth, and in their intervals of rest From toil (if toil it be to court the Muse,) Refresh their sense of beauty on that rich And boldly varied landscape.âWe have met That pair before;âwhat do they in this land?â In truth they do but littleâthough withdrawn Awhile from academic conflicts dire To this, the calm sequester'd home of one, With high intent and purpose to devote The livelong summer to sublime pursuit Of science mathematical.âAnd now In separate, though adjacent, rooms immured, Each on his own peculiar task intent, They commune with Mathesis.âIs it so? Then hath she brought her geometric craft To marvellous perfectionâhath contrived To measure worlds that spread beyond all space;â Hath spann'd Imagination's boundless realm, And ascertain'd the laws, impell'd by which Creative thought explores its wondrous way Even to the Heaven of Heavens.âIn those two rooms Two worlds are now contain'dâtwo phantom worlds, Diverse in kind and excellence, but each A world of beauty,âeach a pleasant home For him whose fancy framed it, (like the web Spun by the silk-worm,) to protect and house His spirit from the pressure of the world. High is the theme of one;âin burning strains He sings ideal Beauty, to his soul Reveal'd in trance-like vision;âher he seeks, In passionate wild flight, through all the realms Of earth, and air, and seaâand, having found, Leads her through fairy palacesâprepares A home, and spreads a couch for her, amidst The pathless clouds, beneath the green sea waves, In woody vales, and deep secluded glensâ Infusing still into her heart of hearts The strong enchantment of his dreamy love. The other, less ambitious, and endued With genius less creative, less intense, Hath, from the beaming regions of the East Stolen a wild-hearted Fay, with whom, at will, He wanders through the world from night to morn, And in her mischievous and magic feats Finds infinite amusement;âyet his song, Now gay, and now sarcasticânow in bursts Of broad rough humour recklessly let looseâ Prefers to linger in the quiet haunts Of peace and love domesticâknows no world, In all Imagination's universe, So blessed as a bright and blazing hearth Surrounded by glad faces:âjoyously Those two, careering on the wings of song, Pursue their several paths, from time to time Relaxing their swift flight, to interchange Encouragement and counsel, each with each. Nor lack they recreation, such as soothes The brain o'erwrought with toil, or by the throng Of fancies multitudinous inflamed To over-much excitementâgentle looks And voices, and the pleasant intercourse Of brothers and of sisters, shelter'd still Beneath that roof parental, and the joy Sedate, although expectant, calm, yet deep, Of plighted lovers, at the altar soon To seal their mutual vows:âwhat lack they more? âThat, without which, even Poesy and youth Are cold and lifelessâthe first dream of love: Nor shall that long be wanting;âwhile we gaze, The scene is changed;âthey wander side by side, Each with a beauteous girlâone ample brow'd And eagle-eyedâthe other light of heart And simple-minded;âlet them dream their dream, Their short-lived dream of passion, while it lasts: For theirs, in very deed, is but dream-love: Not of the heart and will, but of the brain; âFantastic, fleeting, which shall pass away Ere long, and leave the spirit all unchanged, The fountains of affection undisturb'd, And fresh as ever:âlet them dream their dream, Till dawn dispel the illusion:âNobler love Awaits them, when the fancies and wild freaks Of youth shall have been tamed by the approach Of sober manhood, and connubial blissâ Calm, deep, contented, with life's daily toil And duty intermix'dâshall put to flight Those phantoms of unripe and restless thought; For each, amidst the tumult and turmoil Of worldly and unworldly cares and aims, Erecting a sure refuge, housed wherein The heart may take its rest, and gather strength To bear its daily burden, and fulfil, As best it may, the daily task imposed By love divine on Man, that he, on Earth, May win the crown which he shall wear in Heaven. BOOK IV. MANHOOD. INSCRIBED TO MY WIFE. âAt length the Man perceives it die away, And fade into the light of common day.â Wordsworth. It is a shameless thing, when poets chaunt The praises of their wives!âso some aver, Whose judgment I dispute notârather own My full assent, albeit in this respect Myself an old offender.âHymen's bonds, And that most deep contentment of chaste love Within their magic links enclosed and bound, Are holier things than that a man should sport With them, as with the gay fantastic gawds Of wanton gallantry, or to the gaze Of public curiosity, with rude And reckless hand, unveil them.âThe whole world Hath scarce a coarser spectacle to show, Than your fond, foolish, amorous wedded pair Betraying to all eyes, by act and look, The giddy transports of their honeymoon! From such may we for ever dwell apart, Bride of my youth, and now, in middle age, Ten thousand-fold beyond a bride beloved,â My own true-hearted wife!âno sympathy, And slender toleration can we yield To such transgressors of love's holy laws, To such profaners of pure Hymen's bliss. Yet, not the less, must I inscribe to thee This portion of my song, design'd to tell Of manhood's sober cares and temperate joys, Its sorrows, and their solaces;âfor thou Art still the centre around which revolve My earthly hopes and fearsâto which converge My yearnings and affections:âthere is nought Within the compass of my daily life, But takes, in part, its character and form From thy pervading influence;ânor now Is this a bridegroom's fondness;âsixteen years Have spent their noiseless flight since, each to each, We pledged our nuptial faith.âOur eldest boy Hath almost reach'd his teens, which were, in thee, Still incomplete, when thou becam'st a wife; And, in the full meridian of Life's day, A staid and sober pair, we now look back To the gay freaks and follies of our youth, And forward to the late decline of years, As worlds which have been and which are to beâ Diverse alike in form from that which is:â The first remote and dwindling, day by day, In the still lengthening retrospectâthe last Just looming through the mists of unknown Time, And daily seen less distant, less unlike The swiftly changing Present. Years have laid A gentle hand on thee;ânot I alone, But all who knew thee in the days long past, Still recognize, unchanged in face or form, The bride of gay nineteen:âscarce, here and there, Amidst the clusters of thy raven curls, Close-peering eyes may trace a silver streak Threading their ebon gloss;âthy full dark eye Is yet undimm'd and lustrous, and thy form Sylphlike, as when the brisk and tingling-blood Of eighteen summers coursed along thy veins, And thou, amidst our graver English girls, In pride and strength of Scottish art elate, Wast foremost in the dance.âIn ruder sort, Yet not ungently, Time hath dealt with meâ Working perchance but little outward change, For I, since earliest youth, have look'd so old, I scarce look older now;âbut, as my years Cross their meridian, I discern and feel The wane of life within:âthe reckless strength And confidence of health, which knew no change, Are gone for ever:âDeath appears no more A dim and distant phantomânor this world, With all its charms for ear, and eye, and heart, The permanent abode which once it seem'd. My old acquaintance, Asthma, pays me still His annual visitâbut not now alone;â With him his daughter, pale Dyspepsia, comes, And shows me, in her train, approaching fast, Gout and his grimmer brother, her twin sons More hideous than their parent!âIt may be That thou, ere long, wilt have to nurse and tend With all the patience of thy Woman's love, A fractious invalid;âand thou wilt do That office nobly, though with small return Of gratitude, perchance, from thy self-will'd And all too froward charge.âBut we will not Anticipate, in thought, impending ills: Rather, while health suffices, let me seize And fix, if that may be, the form and hue Of this existing Present, which, ere long, Must swell the increasing Past, and be, with it, From memory's page erased, unless the Muse Shall, in ambrosial song, embalm it now, And cause it to become, to me and mine, An heritage for ever. I described, Of late, how poets, in their lusty youth, Sport with the world of Phantasy;âsuch sport In me was past its height, and had begun To sadden into toil and daily care, And all the unblest anxieties of life, When thou and I first met:âyoung love's first dream (A dream indeed, unreal, shadowy, brief,) Was done and endedâand my heart, so far, Not much the worse for wear:âa heavier blow Had done it deeper mischief;âFriendship's bonds, Holy and pure as e'er bound heart to heart, Had, in the rash and headstrong war of thoughtâ The conflict of opinions, old and new,â Been snapp'd, as seem'd, for ever.âI had lost A mistress, and a friendâand in the void Of objectless affection, sought in vain For sympathy and solaceâyet even then Was not forsaken wholly:âI had kept, Though not unscathed, the faith and hope in which I had been nurtured, and although not yet, By ordination and its solemn vows, Expressly set apart to be a priest And steward of the mysteries of Christ, Was storing knowledge, and, with studious thought, Preparing to devote my after life To that high office;âYouth, and youth's wild dreams, Gorgeous and gloomy, sorrowful and gay, Were fading in the clear and sober light Of ripening manhood, and the world become A working place for me.âThen 'twas that thou Didst rise, a prosperous star, upon my path, Discern'd at once among the sparkling throng Of more ignoble firesâdiscern'd and loved, And by the Muse's aid (who never yet Did bard more blessed service) woo'd and won. Not smooth, nor altogether unbeset By trouble or perplexity, to us Was true love's course;âwe shared the common lot Of such as deem that life is more than meat, The body more than raiment, and the mind, With its inborn capacities of bliss, Than all the wealth of this world.âYet, in truth, Our conflict with adversity was short, Though stubborn while it lastedâand, that done, Sweet were the days of courtship,âfair the haunts Through which we wander'd, a wild-hearted pair, Framing our pleasant plans of future life, Its duties and employments. O'er our heads, The forest oaks of Windsor interlaced Their dark umbrageous branches, as we roam'd Through many a brake and dell and bosky bourn, Arm link'd in arm,âor, on our gallant steeds, With fleet and fearless gallop, plunged amain Into the forest's heart.âAlong the marge Of that majestic river, dear to me From boyhood, as to thee romantic Doonâ Through Datchet's fabled meadâbeyond that grey And ivy-mantled tower, sole relic left Of what was Upton Churchâacross the lane Misnamed of cut-throats,âo'er that well-known stile Where first our faith was pledged, (supplanted since By a trim upstart lodge)âthence through the fields Of Eton, with remembrances intense Of early joy and sorrow in my heart Indissolubly link'd,âwe roam'd and roam'd; While thou, with patient ear, to many a tale Of boyhood, by those well-known scenes recall'd, Didst listen, and in turn, with earnest speech, Discourse of all that thou hadst known and loved In thy own mountain land. So pass'd the monthsâ The pleasant months of courtship, till, at length, The Day of days arrived, for many a year With fond anticipation imaged forth To Hope's keen earnest gazeâLife's crowning day, The blest fulfilment of the purest dreams On which young Fancy feeds.âWithout a cloud, Calm, clear, serene, the summer's loveliest child, (A summer such as England seldom knows,) It rose, and shone, and set!âBefore the lark I left the lonely couch of my unrest, And to the river's bank, as I was wont, But in far other than my wonted mood, Directed my wild steps:âthe clear cold stream Received me in its bosom, cooling thus The fever of my own;âwith practised arms I clave the waters, and from shore to shore Cross'd and recross'd,ânow striving with the stream, Which mock'd and overbore my puny strength,â Now floating down its current,ânow supine On the smooth surface of some tranquil pool, With face upturn'd to the blue, cloudless sky, Lay gazing on its beauty, and inhaled The freshness and the fragrance of the morn From air, and earth, and water,âto myself Repeating oft âIt is my wedding day!â No dream, but a reality!â And now The hour was come;âbefore the altar-rails We two stood side by side;âthe solemn vows Were utter'd,âand I wonder'd, while we knelt, That I should feel so calm!âThe wedding peal Rang briskly out,âaround the well-spread board The wedding guests assembled,âall due rites Were decently perform'd,âand, ere 'twas noon, (Friends, kinsfolk, feasters, bridemaids, thy old home And all who dwelt within it left behind) We were alone, and with our faces set Toward Cambria's mountain region.âTill 'twas eve, Conversing in such sort as lovers use, We journey'd;âthen above the horizon rose The towers of Oxfordâspire and pinnacle, And stately dome, and cupola, relieved In outline clear against the cloudless sky With sunset tints suffused. âOur hasty meal Dispatch'dâtill twilight faded into night, We roam'd amidst those silent palaces:â Through broad and spacious courts, deserted then, Nor echoing to the students' sober tread, Nor (as sometimes) by bacchanalian roar Of revellers profanedâthrough long arcades, And many a pillar'd aisle, and cloister dim, We stroll'd, and mark'd the moonbeams, as they stole Through gorgeous panes of stain'd and storied glass, Gild the rich fretted roofs and marble floors Of those time-hallow'd temples.âOn our hearts The spirit of the place descended, calm And solemn, and the day which rose in smiles Accordant to our sunbright morn of hope And hymeneal gladness, closed at last (Meet emblem of a Christian life's decline) In contemplations tranquil and serene, Of life, of death, and of eternity. And we were wedded !âand life's young romance Henceforth to fade away and be dissolved In the clear daylight of reality! Yet, for the space of some three years, or more, The vision seem'd to tarry:âhousehold cares So long we knew not, nor the pleasant sound Of children's voices, nor had yet commenced Those pastoral duties, amidst which hath past, Since then, the prime of life:âmy daily task Employ'd, but not oppress'd me, nor engross'd So large a space of time but more remain'd For pleasant studies and amusements, such As we might share together:âLife was still Almost a constant holiday to us; And when the waning summer set us free Even from that gentle yoke which gall'd us not, With what exultant eagerness we broke Our bondage, and, uncheck'd by nursery ties, Shaped our swift flight, as fancy might direct, Or old affection urgeânow skimm'd the lakes And climb'd the mountains of thy native land; Now, on green Devon's slopes, forgot the ways Of artificial life, and grew adepts At old Arcadian usages; and now In deep Salopian vales, amidst the homes And habitations of my kindred, shared Familiar joys, feeding our gaze meanwhile On nature's richest beauty!âDreamlike still,â A trance Elysian,âwas our Dream of Life. It is not good that years should pass away Unburden'd by the weight of care and toil Which is Man's lot and portion here on Earth. Those yearsâI mourn them notânor wish them back, Though pleasant in the retrospectâunlike (O how unlike!) the round of varied tasks, And duties which employ my noon of life!â The daily load of ministerial care,â The parent's anxious toil of head and heart,â The ceaseless stir and tumult of the world!â It is by these that men must liveâin these Our Father's spirit breathes. No easier lot I covet,âonly ask for heartier zeal, And strength according to my need, and faith Working by love, to do and to endure Whatever Heaven may will, till the day close, And the night come wherein no man can work. There is a little town, Rugby, in Warwickshire. within short space Of England's central point, of various brick Irregularly built, nor much adorn'd By architectural craftâsave that, indeed, As you approach it from the south, a pile Of questionable Gothic lifts its head With somewhat of a grave collegiate air, Not unbefitting what, in truth, it is,â A seat of academic discipline And classic education:âat its base Stretches a broad expanse of verdant turf With stately trees bestuddedâthe resort Of schoolboys from their studious toil released, And bent on sport athletic:âbut for this, The place might pass unnoticedâto speak truth, As insignificant a market-town As may be seen in England. Far around Extends a pastoral glade, to numerous herds Yielding abundant herbage, but ungraced By much of rural beautyâfeatureless, And to the poet's and the painter's eye Alike insipid ;âa wide, weary tract Of hedgerow upon hedgerow.âRock nor hill,â Nor graceful undulation here is seen; The very stream which waters the fat meads (Shaksperian Avon) hath not yet attain'd The breadth and beauty of his later course, But winds between his flat and reedy banks, A thin, meandering, melancholy thread Of slow, dull, slimy water:âthe sole charms Of which, with truth, the unvaried landscape boasts, Are verdure and fertility:âthe grass Grows freshly, and the hedgerow trees present Masses of summer foliage, with rich tints Diversified in Autumn:âthere is nought To seek or shun, to hate or fondly love, For miles and miles around! Amidst such scenes, The lines are fallen to me ;âamidst such scenes I own a goodly heritageâcontent, In the fulfilment of allotted tasks, Here, if Heaven will, to live, and here to die. Strange to the youthful minister of Christ, Yet not unmixt with pleasure, is the awe And anxious curiosity with which He first approaches his appointed sphere Of pastoral dutyâfirst inspects the fold Of which he is the shepherd, and looks round On faces which henceforth he is to know In joy and grief, in sickness and in health, Through many a chance and change of mortal life, In many a close relation; he meanwhileâ (Though haply versed in theologic lore)â Unpractised, inexperienced in the ways Of Man's mysterious heart,âunused to guide, To comfort, to reprove, exhort, convince, Or do the thousand offices of love And Christian wisdom at his hands required, And pressing on his heart. With what keen sense Of high responsibilities, incurr'd By weakness (then, if ever, deeply felt,) He first ascends the pulpit !âfirst surveys The motley congregation closely pack'd, And all intent, with curious eye and ear, To see, hear, criticiseâsome few to learn And welcome, with devout and docile hearts, Him, their commission'd teacher! In their homes, And by their hospitable hearths, for him With festal fires ablaze,âat social board, Or cheerful tea-table, whence fairest hands Dispense the nectarous fluid, to his taste With nicest art adaptedâeach new face Arrests his anxious eye; each voice conveys To his awaken'd and attentive ear Some token, faint perchance, of fear or hope, Of comfort or discouragement.âTo whom, Among these cordial guests, in years to come, Shall he resort for counsel? Which shall aid, With sympathy and solace pure and true, His ministerial toilâand which oppose, Impede, embarrass,âsometimes haply mar His all too feeble efforts to promote The welfare of his flock?âWhich shall be found His friend, and which his enemy?âWith whom, At intervals of rest from pastoral care, Shall he take pleasant counsel, and converse On subjects which unbend, but not unnerve The else o'er-labour'd mind?âSuch thoughts, perchance, Flit swiftly thro' his brain:âMeanwhile he knows Himself the mark of scrutinizing eyes, And curious observation:âapt remarks Are venturedâsubtle questions ask'd, to probe And fathom his opinions:ââIs he Whig In Politics, or Tory?âOrthodox In creed, or Evangelical?âWhat sect Within the Church,âwhat party in the State, Minutely in the parish imaged forth, Shall find him its ally?âWill he adhere To old establish'd customs, and uphold The right prescriptive of a parish priest To hunt, and shoot, and fish, and be the first In all convivial revels?âstrong at whist, And matchless at back-gammon?âor, imbued With puritanic scruples, will he shun The world and all its pleasuresâin their stead Frequenting the resort of serious folk, Committee-rooms and platformsâwhere the stage And its profane excitements are eclipsed (As some aver) by oratoric feats Of reverend men, who spurn alike the rules Of grammar and the Church, and, in glib phrase, Clip the Queen's English,âworthily repaid For such achievements by the breath and bruit Of popular applause?âOr will he prove A stern ascetic, in Tractarian lore Profoundly versed, entangling simple souls In bonds from which the Gospel sets them freeâ Enjoining strict observance of the round Of festivals and fasts and daily prayers, And inconvenient alms-deeds,âapt himself To fast and watch and mortify the flesh With superstitious rigour,âteaching much By precept and example, against which We must perforce contend?ââWith such profound And profitable queries, others mix Less abstract speculationsââIs he one Accessible as yet to Beauty's charms?â A prize to be contested by the skill Of mothers and their daughters?âthe church glebe Is rich and ample, and the Parsonage (Judiciously enlarged) might well be made A comfortable mansion.ââCease, fair dames, Such musings, which the invulnerable man With grim, sly smiles suspects.âIn distant bowers, The lady of his love already twines Her nuptial wreath, and, ere six months have flown, The bells from yon grey tower, with deafening peal, Shall blithely welcome to their destined home The Rector and his Bride. It ill beseems The poetâhim especially whose crown Of laurel must surmount the sober garb For reverend clerks appointedâto select, Amidst the present scenes of actual life, The subjects of his song. This week-day worldâ Its caresâits toilsâits sharp anxietiesâ The friends and foes of living flesh and blood, With whom we sympathise and strive by turnsâ These to Reality's dull realm belong, And scarcely from that realm can be transferr'd To Phantasy's domain, without neglect Or partial violation of the laws Of social life.âSuch fault be far from me! Not in the Present, but the dreamy Past, And not among the Living, but the Deadâ The unforgotten tenants of the graveâ The men o'er whose infirmities and faults Remembrance draws a veil of shadowy haze, Which glorifies their virtuesâamong such Would I once more, in retrospective thought, Live over my young days of pastoral care, And interweave with this historic song Some faint reflection of departed worth And excellence still honour'd, which perchance, Not by surviving eyes unrecognized, May to surviving hearts recall a train Of pleasant recollections, nor incur Reproach or censureârather, let me hope, Awaken kind and not unthankful thoughts Tow'rd him who, if he could, would thus embalm, In unguent mix'd of grave and sportive verse, Their loved and lost on Earth. At the town's end There is a neat and unpretending house, Used to be the last house to the left on the Newbold Road: now pulled down and re-built. Which you approach through a low wooden gate Beneath an arch of laurel;âa small porch Of trellis-work, with odorous jessamine And most luxuriant clematis entwined, Shelters the expectant visitor, whose knock Is yet unanswer'd;âa bay window, fill'd With flowering shrubs, on the left hand, admits The late effulgence of the western Sun To what, when first I knew it, long had been The favourite room of one in many a heart Still honour'd and remember'dâthen my kind And hospitable host. An aged man, Already on the verge of full fourscore, Was he, and, in his youth and middle age, Had on the seas, beneath old England's flag, Fought and commanded; but for many a year (The toils and perils of the deep foregone) Had led a quiet and secluded life In that snug dwelling, by the general voice Of friends and neighbours quaintly named, from him, âThe Admiralty.â Seldom hath a heart So frank and simple dwelt within a frame So burly and gigantic; lustier voice Than his, on shipboard, never yet outroar'd The thunder, or was heard above the din Of battle:âhe was, all in all, compact, Heart, voice, soul, sinews, bulk;âcolossalâvast, As of the race of Anak,âyet, withal As gentle as a lamb:âno kindlier smile Than his e'er beam'd on childhoodâ(and, in truth, He had his share of grandchildren;)âno brow Was e'er unbent on Woman with more bland And guileless show of love; and if his laugh Was somewhat over-boisterous, and his jest Couch'd in sea-phrase, and, like a seaman's speech, Blunt and unpolish'd,âif fastidious ears Might shrink from his sea-ditties, thunder'd forth As though a broadside roar'dâthe daintiest dame Forgot such venial trespass in the sense Of that inborn benignity which glow'd And glisten'd in his look, and was diffused Through his whole soul and spirit. Him all ranks And classes loved and honour'd;âto his house Gentle and simple, country squire and clown, Scholar and tradesman, pedagogue and peer, Each sure of his appropriate welcome, came. The nobles of the land were not ashamed To leave awhile their lordly palace halls, And spend an hour beneath that humble roof In pleased, familiar talk with the old man, Who on his part received them with blunt phrase Of unaffected courtesy;âthe poor Flock'd to him as their friend:âin grief and joy He sympathized with all.âTwo serving-maids, Some twenty years his juniors,âone obese And rubicund,âthe other spare and lean,â With a red-nosed, ill-manner'd serving-man, Who rather ruled than served his easy lord,â These form'd his household:âan asthmatic steed Was, like his master, pension'd on half-pay, Or rarely into active service call'd From the near paddock. Such, for some few years From the first date of my incumbency, Continued his establishment, by laws Most primitive and patriarchal ruled, And unprofaned by aught of modish taste Or over-costly luxury, though rich In whatsoever to the incorrupt And unsophisticated heart affords Repose and satisfaction.âAt the end Of that brief time, with little outward change, Or more decided symptom of decay, After some days of sickness, meekly borne, With calm expression of a Christian's hope The old man fell asleep. Light lie the turf On that stout heart, as simple and sincere, As gentle and as brave as ever throbb'd Beneath a sailor's bosom!âbe his sleep The sleep of Paradise, till the last trump To resurrection and their final doom Summon the awaken'd dead! Nor let me pass Unnoticed or unhonour'd in this lay One who; by me but little known, hath yet Left on my memory the abiding trace Of his urbane and cordial courtesy, By scholarship and classic taste refined; âA courtly, polish'd man, of bland address, And clerical attire with rigorous taste Adjusted and adorn'dâhis reverend head Well powder'd and pomatum'dâeven the crown, Which five and fifty winters had made bald, With scrupulous exactness frosted o'er;â His central bulk, spruce, dapper, and rotund, In silk and broadcloth of correctest cut And sablest hue array'd;âhis nether parts In hose unwrinkled of the finest woof, And breeches, silver-buckled at the knee, Display'd their plump proportions:âvoice and look, Gesture and phrase, to the discerning mind, Proclaim'd the pedagogueâone of a race Now passing from the earth;âno man of thought, Deep, earnest, serious, seething in the brain Incessantly;âno framer of vague plans And purposes, imperfect, ever new, From the rich depths of an exhaustless mind, By the strong working of a Christian heart Evolved;âno rash enthusiast, labouring still To purify, exalt, and bless mankind, And using education as the means By Heaven, beyond all other means, ordain'd To accomplish that high task.âSuch men our age, In this beyond preceding ages blest, Hath seen, and loved, and mourn'd;âbut unlike these The generation which preceded ours,â The teachers of our sires and of ourselves. Less lofty was their aim;âmore moderate praise Contented their ambition.âThe dead tonguesâ Their prosody and syntaxâthe nice rules Of compositionâthe mysterious craft Of metresâthese to them were all in allâ The end of education, not the means. Nor be it held dispraise to speak of one Not last, nor least distinguish'd in his day, As walking in the ways of his compeers With steps which equall'd theirs, but not outstripp'd. It was enough, for him of whom I speak, To guard, with rigid and punctilious zeal, That which he found establish'd;âto maintain, Unchang'd and unimpair'd, the old, tried course Of classic education, handed down From those who went before him. This he did With firm, unbending purpose, and became The perfect model of a schoolmaster, Such as our sires respectedâsuch as we, In the vain pride of our conceited age, Are prone to undervalueâblind alike To what exalts the Presentâwhat the Past. Far juster was the estimate which he Form'd of himself:âproud was he of his craft, Nor would abate one tittle of its claims To honour and respect:âhis air and tone Were those of one who felt himself high raised Above unlearned, unscholastic men; And, in or out of school, with equal pomp, Right stately did he bear himself:âall rules Of etiquetteâall nice formalities, He practised and exactedâwas, in truth, In discipline a very martinet; And when, in annual chair of state enthronedâ Surrounded by aristocratic groups, The county's high nobility,âhe sat Dispensing prizesâthe world could not shew A prouder, happier man! Yet deem him not Haughty or arrogant,âin manners stiff, Cold and repulsive:âkindly was his heart, Gentle he was and affable to all; And, when the labour of the day was done, Loved with his neighbours at the social board To spend a joyous hour, well pleased to reign Supreme o'er mirth and music, whist and wit,â Assuming and receiving at all hands Precedency of place, and recognized As absolute Dictator. Yet such rank Was not, without resistance and dispute, At once assign'd him:âOur Republic found A Brutus for this CÃ¦sar.âOne there was Whom Nature's hand had moulded to resist Unconstitutional autocracy, And hold it at defianceâa true son Of Albionâall her dauntless Saxon blood Careering in his veinsâa brave, blunt man, Laborious, energetic, shrewd of wit, And resolute of action:âno adept Was he at rules conventionalâno slave To forms of etiquetteâno worshipper Of rank or sounding titles:âsmall respect He own'd or felt for academic grade, Or dignity ecclesiastical, Save as the visible and outward garb Of solid worth within:âhis piercing eye, Disdaining shows and seemings, ever sought That which was real:âhe esteem'd the man, And not the cloakâthe kernel, not the husk. Whate'er himself possess'd of place, or wealth, Or credit with the world, had been acquired By the innate and energetic strength And vigour of his mind,âby industry And persevering toil of head and heartâ By due discharge of honourable trust In the far Indies, whence he had return'd, After few years in public duties spent, A rich and prosperous man. Such energy, Moral and intellectual, as could work What he had wrought,âcould bear what he had borne, And gain what he had gain'dâand such alone, He honour'd and esteem'd in other men. All elseâdiplomasâdignitiesâdegreesâ Hereditary rankâancestral prideâ Whate'er weak minds revereâhe held dirt cheap, And view'd, with somewhat of a jealous eye, Monopolies of homage from of old, In this aristocratic land, assign'd To place, and station, and official rank, Or well or ill maintain'd, with small regard To aught which truly dignifies them all, And gives them actual value:âhence he grew, Almost by Nature's strong necessity, Antagonistic to the Powers that wereâ A stout and sturdy oppositionist, Obstructing, by all lawful ways and means, What seem'd encroachments of despotic sway; Asserting and maintaining the plain rights Of social independence against all Which look'd like usurpation. Hence arose Occasional seditionâtart debate Colloquialâinsurrection, to restrain, Within legitimate and wholesome bounds, Monarchical prerogative.âMeanwhile The Monarch was not slow to take the field, With such offensive and defensive arms As courteous scholars useâgrave ironyâ Sarcastic reparteeâserenest smile Of dignified compassion. Thus they two (If old, traditionary tales speak truth Of times beyond the memory of the Bard) For many a year contended, yet broke not The bonds of social neighbourhood, nor lost Their sense of mutual good-will. O'er both The grave long since hath closed:âthe petty feuds And jealousies of earth divide them not In that good land where both; we trust, have found Acceptance and repose. But all too long, Methinks, we dwell among remembrances Of days and things gone by:â'tis meet we turn, Beloved, to the Present.âOur abodeâ The tabernacle of our earthly joys And sorrows, hopes and fearsâthis home of oursâ Is it not pleasant?âIs there one eleswhere For which we would exchange it?âFourteen years, Well nigh elapsed, have rear'd the puny trees We planted at our coming, to a screen And somewhat of a shade;âour small domain, Compact within itself, nor overlook'd, (Albeit well nigh on every side begirt By new and upstart dwellings,) forms a nook In which the meek and unambitious heart May live and die contented:âwithin doors We have enough of comfortâand, without, Of verdure, and bright sunshine, and fresh air, To make our dwelling cheerful:âyon green field, Between us and intrusion interposed, Forms for our children a broad ample realm Of undisturb'd enjoyment:âthat tall pair Of venerable elms, beneath whose shade Lie buried those old favourites canine Whose race, had we been childless, might perchance E'en now have shared our hearthâthose elms, methinks, May serve us for apt emblems of ourselvesâ A hale, green pair, not yet much past their prime, And from their grassy mound, in reverend state, On a new generation looking down Of young and hopeful plants.âBy Fancy's aid We might suppose them representatives Of the successive tenants of this houseâ The pastors of the parish and their wives, Whose spirits, from the burden of the flesh And all its toil released, have migrated, Like Baucis and Philemon's in old time, Into those leafy tenements, and there, Fast by the mansion of their earthly life, Await the body's waking.âBut such sport Of wilful Fancy haply ill accords With the sad aspect of yon burial-ground Contiguous to our gardenâthe long home Of vanish'd generations, and in which Both thou and I, ere many years have pass'd, Must look to lay our bones. We lack not here Mementos of mortality:âno knell Proclaims the passing of a neighbour's soul, But we are first to hear it;ânot a corpse Is carried to its resting-place, but I Do the last sacred offices;âno week,â Scarce a day passes, but some bed of death, Or long consuming sickness, summons me To minister beside it:ânor art thou With sorrow less familiar, or less apt To do thy part as comforter, and yield Such help as woman only can dispense To sickness and affliction. Strange 'twould be, If all that we behold of chance and change, Of sorrow and mortality, should leave No trace upon our spirits, nor impress On our remembrance ineffaceably The lesson of the Church, that âin the midst Of life we are in death.ââYet more perhaps Than most of those with whom our lot is cast, We lack such admonition:âlife to us Is fill'd, by bounteous Providence, so full Of purest comfort! Since this house became Our habitation, it hath seen more bliss Than many a life of threescore years and ten Brings to another dwellingâless of grief Than one brief month hath brought to not a few. There's scarce a room, beneath our roof, unmark'd By some distinction of remember'd joy;â Of friends, whose visits, though too much like those Of angelsâpassing short and far betweenâ Almost like those of angels gladden'd us;â Of pleasant and endearing intercourse With neighbours whom we love;âof home-content, Enliven'd by those studies and pursuits Which purify and strengthen, while they soothe The weary mind. Here, in this study, cramm'd With strangest piles of heterogeneous lore, O'er Shakspere's magic pages we have laugh'd And wept by turns, while fairest fingers plied The busy needle, and the reader's art Repaid their cheerful toil:âon yonder chair, Honour'd beyond its drawing-room compeers, Sate once the mighty Poet of the Lakes, And in his deep, sonorous voice conversed On themes of loftiest import:âin this house Six children have been born to usâof whom Five until now, by Heaven's rich grace, remain, And one hath fallen asleep.âMy boyish dreams Of happiness (though passing bright they were) Fell short of the reality which still Beneath this roof abidesâreality Too bright to be enduring.âMay we wait In thoughtful preparation, and endure With patience, whatsoever change shall come! High theme it wereâ(too high for verse like mine)â To tell the toils, the pleasures, and the cares Of ministerial duty;âto set forth The life of an ambassador for Christ Such as it isâalas! how much unlike That which it ought to be! Else there were food For musing not unfruitful, not unblest, In that long retrospect of years elapsed Amidst parochial cares and toils and plans, Which teems, as I survey it, with strange forms Of human joy and sorrow. In the town There's scarce a house but to my mind recalls Some sad or pleasing image of past daysâ Some consolation offer'dâsome sick bed Sooth'd or alarm'dâsome confidence enjoy'dâ Some doubt dispell'dâalas! some vain assault On some stronghold of Satanâsome defeat Encounter'dâsome discomfiture sustain'd Through lack of faith or courage.âOf such things Let me not lightly speak, but speak in words Recorded ere remembrance yet had lost Its first impression.âTwo such homely lays I framed in other years;âthe first a tale (If tale it may be call'd) of grievous pain, Through faith and patience wondrously endured, And by endurance vanquish'd;âa wild strain The other, in Spenserian rhyme jocose Recounting rustic feats of boisterous glee And festal recreation, with a cause Connected, righteous once, though since, alas! By erring and fanatic zeal profaned, And fitly, to sectarian patronage Abandon'd by the Church.âElsewhere than here Be those twin songs recorded, and preserve (If that perchance may be) to after days Some memory of the English pastor's cares And pastimes in this nineteenth century! See âLays of the Parish,â in the second volume. So end my Dream of Life!âfor life is now Less dream-like than it has been;âsave, indeed, That with a swifter and yet swifter course The years begin and endâtheir hopes and fears Blossom and fadeâtheir sorrows and their joys Are born and buried. While I strive to grasp What seems the Present, it becomes the Past. All things appear more fugitive, and yet Less lovely than they did. The gorgeous hues In which imagination clothed the world While life was young, have faded:âwhat remains Is, in its proper lineaments, discern'd, And felt to be precariousâa brief dream, Without a dream's magnificence:âand yet To this the heart still cleaves, as in its youth It clave to Fancy's daintiest imagery; Still as one joy dissolves and fades away, Reposing on a new one. Death and Change Are found to teach but slowly that sad truth, That no continuing city have we hereâ No rest for our foot-sole.âAnd yet their school, Severe and stern, allows few holidays From grief and disappointment!âwhile I weave This meditative lay, how rich a source Of present solace, and of hope that gave Bright promise for the future, with a stroke Hath been cut off for ever!âHE is dead!â He, whom all England honour'd as her first Of Christian teachers;âHe, by whom her youth Were train'd and lesson'd with most earnest zeal, And depth unknown of wisdom from above, In Christ's all-perfect rule, and taught to take His yoke upon them, and to bear His cross, As Men who, with divine and human lore Rightly imbuedâin intellect and heart Well disciplinedâwith heavenly arms equipp'dâ And knowing both the prize for which they strove, And how it must be wonâshould, in this world, Fight the good fight of faith.âAlas! for us! His townsmen and near neighbours!âus, whose hopes Parental with his life were close entwined! Who deem'd our children's the most blessed lot By Providence to children e'er assign'd, In that, by him, their young intelligence, Develop'd and inform'd, should first expand Its fresh and tender blossoms,âthat in him, Their teacher and their guide, they should behold A model of what Christians ought to be! Alas! for us!âbut not for us alone!â Britainâall EuropeâChristendom itself Mourns his untimely loss:âthe Church bewails, In him, the best and bravest of her sons; Him, if sometimes an erring, never found A weak or craven champion in her cause: For ne'er were truth and goodness loved and sought With more devoted fervour than by him; Nor oft have noblest intellectual gifts Been sanctified by loftier piety Than in his bosom dwelt. His inward eye, Clear, rapid, comprehensive, at a glance Discern'dâif not the perfect form of Truthâ At least her shadowy lineamentsâwhich straight With stedfast gaze he follow'd, in his course Flashing swift gleams of unexpected light On whatsoever subject of high thought Cross'd or approach'd his path. For human illsâ The want and woeâthe ignorance and sinâ The bondage of corruption beneath which The creature, in its anguish and unrest, Still groans and travailsâfor whatever wrong The feeble suffer and the strong inflictâ His was the sorrow of a Christian saintâ His were the projects of a Christian sage.â For Britain's helpless millions above all, Writhing in dumb, blind painâuntaught, unfedâ With earnest heart, and brain, and tongue, and pen, He toil'd to achieve deliverance;âto his end, Through honour and dishonour, through report Evil and good, still constant.âYet, in him, Philanthropy (too oft in feebler minds Destructive of less liberal sympathies) Marr'd not one home affection, but enhanced And purified them all:âno happier hearth Than his e'er flung its winter evening blaze On groups of joyous faces;âthere was not In all the world a parent, husband, friend, More excellent than he! Nor was the face Of Natureâher mysterious lovelinessâ To him indifferent;âflowers, and trees, and fruits,â Beast, insect, feather'd fowl, and creeping thingâ Whatever God hath madeâthe mountain ridge Embosoming the lake, near which he spent His intervals of rest from lifelong toilâ The primrose on the bankâthe hawthorn hedge, With woodbines and wild roses intertwinedâ He loved them all! Majestic was his soul, And gentle in its majestyâalive To whatsoe'er in this material world Reveals the presence of Divinity, And therefore full of love! Alas for us! Who knew himâwho beheld and felt the power Of goodness which abode in himâand yet Scarce loved it till 'twas lost!âAlas for thee! Poor town, in which he sojourn'd for a time, And which his sojourn dignified!âAlas! For what thou art and hast been!âIchabod! Thy glory hath departed! âFare thee well!â Henceforth, though I shall know thee as my home, I will not view thee with a Poet's eye, Nor wed thy name to verse.âAnd yet indeed I love thee much, unlovely as thou art, And in thy featureless repose of look, Reflecting well that uneventful course Of the mid life of man, to which my days Have now attain'd;âand though thou must become Less pleasant, less endear'd to me, as years Roll onwardâthough this house, now musical With voices which I love, as I grow old Must lose them, one by one, till we are leftâ (If death by swifter stroke divide us not) âI and my partnerâinmates of a home Childless at lastânot therefore will I now Grudge thee such love as thou hast well deserv'dâ Such as thou still deserv'st. When I am gone, May better and more gifted pastors dwell Where I have dwelt so pleasantly!âYon Church, Not even by Rickman's genius, in late years, Reclaim'd from that unblushing ugliness And degradation of deformity By parsimonious thrift inflicted onceâ May a new generation, more devout Than we and than our fathersâpull it down, As what defies amendment, and erect A temple, worthier of the name it bears, On what is now its site!âBut till it fall, Still may the worship of our English Church, As now, within its walls, in solemn pomp Liturgical, with full accordant strains Of the deep organ and symphonious chaunt Of choristers, ascend from it to Heaven, Wafting the aspirations pure and deep Of Christian hearts!âmay never sound of hymn, Such as these latter days have spawn'd in shoalsâ Doggrel, prosaic, puritanical, Quintessence of flat balderdashâpollute Its sacred walls, suggesting to the mind Of worshippers, who wish to be devout, Involuntary thoughts which curl the lip Perforce into a smile!âmay all who there Kneel at one altar, be hereafter One In heart and spirit!âthe whole Church on Earth Anticipating, as the dawn draws nigh, The eternal concord of the Church in Heaven!

      <field name="fulltext">[VOLUME II] PART I. LAYS OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH. FIRST SUNDAY IN ADVENT. FROM THE EPISTLE. I Through the dreary night of ages, While the world's gross dreamers slept, Wakeful eyes of saints and sages Have their lifelong vigil kept. While long ages wax and wane, Still they wake and weep in vain. II Were thy words too boldly spoken, Heralding salvation near, Holy Paul?âalas! no token Of the dawn doth yet appear. Through thick clouds of grief and sin Breaks no gleam of twilight in. III Hath the Lord his Church forsaken? Nay!âto faith's quick ear and eye, Signs, too clear to be mistaken, Tell of his redemption nigh. Though gross darkness gird us round, We an inner light have found. IV As the fleshly eye grows dimmer, And the brow besprent with greyâ Nearer we discern the glimmer Of the soul's eternal day. As the grave begins to yawn, Clear and perfect grows our dawn. V Lo! the eastern mountains kindle With upshooting beams afar! Lo! already droop and dwindle Waning moon and morning star! Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, Soon our weary eyes shall bless. VI Christ himself!âmake haste to meet him! Cast your robes of sin away; Clothed in light, go forth to greet him, Children of the sober day; Not o'ercharged with foul excess, Not in lust and wantonness; VII Not in wrath and fierce vexation, Not in envying, not in strife, Chaunt your hymns of gratulation To the Lord of light and life. Changed by Him, in heart and will, Let not flesh its lusts fulfil. FROM THE GOSPEL. I Our Lord came once in humble state, And poor and mean array, While crowds did on his advent wait, And strew'd with boughs his way. Upon a colt, an ass's foal, He rode in lowly guise, While shouts and songs, that mock'd control, Peal'd round him to the skies. II âHosannah to the mighty King Of David's royal stem! Whom, in Jehovah's name, we bring To his Jerusalem!â So ran the shout from tongue to tongue, While He in peace drew nearâ Those tongues which soon foul insult flung Upon his cross and bier! III And many a weary age hath past Since those dark deeds were doneâ And men would fain believe at last His reign almost begun. That day, 'tis said, shall dawn ere long, When He o'er Earth shall ride, Begirt by Heaven's angelic throng, And martyrs glorified. IV So dream we, and with venturous skill Heaven's times and seasons guessâ Yet cleave to this world's follies still, Nor love its bawbles less. Alas! and sensual lust and hate, And wasting strife and care, Pollute and vex, from gate to gate, Our Father's House of prayer! V With garb and gauds of harlot pride And loveless smiles bedeck'd, The Church, unlike a virgin bride, Her bridegroom doth expect: And we, who those blind hearts condemn, Which Life's own Lord could slay,â Should haply, had we lived with them, Have been as blind as they! SECOND SUNDAY IN ADVENT. FROM THE EPISTLE. I A world of deep and fervent thought God's word doth to our gaze unfoldâ Whate'er was done, or felt, or taught, By saints and holy men of old; Their faith and patience, hope and love,â Their trials in this nether sphereâ And how they won their crown above Through purifying sorrow here. II Nor is this all; for God hath given, To bless the mind's believing eye, And lead the loving heart to heaven, The sunbright scroll of prophecy:â Blest glimpses of the bliss to come Hereafter to this world below, When Truth and Love shall build their home Where sin dwells now with shame and woe. III Six thousand years, in toil and pain, Hath all Creation travail'd sore;â Six thousand years, alas! in vain, Nor yet that weary travail o'er! And well might strongest hearts give way Beneath the incumbent weight of ill, Which grows and gathers day by day, Uncheck'd, unheal'd, triumphant still! IV Yet this must end;âdeceit and guile, And violence, and lust, and hate Shall not, for aye, God's world defile, Nor lay its glories desolate. We look for a new Earth and Heaven, Where righteousness in peace shall dwell, When He to penal flames hath given This globe of ours, with death and hell. FROM THE GOSPEL. SONNET. Though Heaven and Earth, like dreams, should pass away, Christ's word remaineth stedfast:âfrom their base The hills may be up-rent, and know their place No longer,âthe great light which rules the day Be quench'd,âthe seas, burnt up, no more obey Their rayless mistress,âeach created race Of beast, bird, insect, vanish from the face Of Nature, sunk, herself, in deep decay;â But nought which He hath spoken e'er shall fail;â Truth, goodness, mercy, wisdom, cannot die, Nor aught in Earth or Heaven or Hell prevail To mar His word, who from his throne on high Came down and suffer'd in this tearful vale, To save lost Man through all eternity. THIRD SUNDAY IN ADVENT. FROM THE EPISTLE. I As ministers of Christ, with high commission Entrusted, his rich bounties to dispense, And win, (if that may be,) from lost condition To faith and hope, the slaves of sin and sense,â As pledged to preach, or in or out of season, His truth to ears which hearken or reject,â To guide, console, rebuke, and mildly reasonâ Of us account, and yield us due respect. II By us affused, the pure baptismal water Doth to repentant souls rich gifts convey, Sealing, to Heaven's adopted son or daughter, Grace which shall wash the inborn sin away. 'Tis ours to dress the board, to crown the chalice, With rich regalement of celestial food,â From lips profane, deep stain'd with fraud or malice, Withholding still Christ's body and his blood. III Respect our office,âbut insist, meanwhile, That we should to our trust be faithful found; Not marring truth with flatteries base and vileâ Not fearing to reprove where sins abound,â As duty calls, the cross still meekly bearing,â Ne'er shunning God's whole counsel to make known,â Ourselves, our flocks, with equal zeal preparing To meet the summons to His judgment throne. FROM THE GOSPEL. I Fast bound in darksome prison The saintly Baptist lay, While on the world had risen Redemption's vernal day: And many a wondrous story To cheer his spirit came, Of Christ's increasing glory, And ever spreading fame. II Then spake he in his gladnessâ âGo forth, my brethren twain, Who soothe my dungeon's sadness, And glory in my chainâ Go ask this godlike seemer, Of whom such things we hear,â Art thou the true Redeemer, Or must a third appear?â III Our Lord, in his deep kindness, When they this message brought, On sickness, pain, and blindness, His healing mercies wrought; And while each dark disaster Before him seem'd to flee, âGo tell,â he said, âyour master, The things ye hear and see. IV âThe lame their strength recover, The lepers lose their stain, The blind man's night is over, The deaf can hear again; From Heaven hath light descended To men of low degree;â Whoso is not offended, The same is blest in me.â V So spake our great Redeemer,â So let our hearts reply! For who so blind a dreamer, So dull of heart and eye, As not to see around him, As not to feel within, That Satan's chain hath bound himâ That Christ hath conquer'd sin?â VI We ask not signs and wondersâ We go not forth to find Rocks split by volleying thunders, Reeds shaken by the wind. By peace in Earth and Heaven, By blissful hearth and home, By all His grace hath givenâ We know that Christ hath come. FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT. FROM THE EPISTLE. I Rejoice in Christ alwayâ When Earth looks heavenly bright, When joy makes glad the livelong day, And peace shuts in the night. Rejoice, when care and woe The fainting soul oppress,â When tears at wakeful midnight flow, And morn brings heaviness. II Rejoice, when festal boughs Our winter walls adorn, And Christians greet, with hymns and vows, The Saviour's natal morn. Rejoice, when mourning weeds The widow'd Church doth wear In memory of her Lord who bleeds, While Christians fast to prayer. III Rejoice in hope and fear,â Rejoice in life and death,â Rejoice, when threatening storms are near, And comfort languisheth. When should not they rejoice, Whom Christ his brethren callsâ Who hear and know his guiding voice When on their hearts it falls? IV Yet not to rash excess Let joy like ours prevail;â Feast not on Earth's deliciousness, Till faith begin to fail. Our temperate use of blissâ Let it to all appear; And be our constant watchword thisâ âThe Lord himself is near!â V Take anxious care for nought,â To God your wants make known, And soar, on wings of heavenly thought, Tow'rd His eternal throne. So, though our path is steep, And many a tempest lours, Shall His own peace our spirits keep, And Christ's dear love be ours. FROM THE GOSPEL. I âWanderer in the desert bare,â Man of pale and thoughtful brow, With thy robe of camel's hairâ Tell us who and what art thou? Art thou He for whom we waitâ He who, as we fondly deem, From their low and lost estate Shall our weary tribes redeem?â II âNot Messiah's self am I,â (Straight the Baptist did confess,) âBut a voice that loud doth cry In the echoing wildernessâ Haste, prepare Jehovah's wayâ Such the message which I bear;â Disobedient hearts obey! Stubborn knees be bent in prayer!â III âThou art not Elias then, Nor the prophet yet to be; Wherefore should the sons of men Come to be baptized of thee?â Thus, in proud and taunting ire, Did the Pharisees reply;â Straightway gleams of heavenly fire Kindled in the Baptist's eye. IV âYea,â he cried, âright well ye say, I with water now baptize; But among you stands to-day One, yet hidden from your eyesâ One who doth all worlds control, Heavenly Son of heavenly Sire; He shall wash the sinful soul With the Holy Ghost and fire.â V Jesu!âthe baptismal rite, Ere we knew thee, made us thine; With thy Spirit's gentle might Come, our carnal hearts refine! Purify and light and heat All the darksome depths within; Heal, in nature's last retreat, All her sicknessâall her sin! CHRISTMAS DAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I By vision clear and truthlike dreamâ By awful voices heard from Heaven,â By many a brief, but glorious gleam Of his own brightness faintly given,â By type and emblem, rite and law,â By prophets' voices stern and bold,â By all they felt, by all they saw,â God to our fathers spake of old. II But dreams are vague, and visions dim, And e'en the heavenly sounds, that flow From holiest lips of Seraphim, To sinful hearts seem faint and low; And typesâwe scarce know what they mean, And little heed we sage or seer, Compared with what our eyes have seen,â Compared with what our ears may hear. III For God's own Son, to whom is given Dominion o'er all worlds that are,â Whose power upholds both Earth and Heaven,â Who guides and governs sun and star,â In whose refulgent person shine His Father's lineaments express,â Hath come on Earth, through love divine To purge our human sinfulness. IV And through the deeds His love hath done, âThough heir himself of Heavenâhath He A throne above the angels won, Beside the Eternal Majesty. And theyâthe beautifulâthe bright, Who ride upon the lightning's flame, And guide at will the whirlwind's might, Fall down and worship at his Name. V O Lord! eternal is thy throneâ Thee Heaven's immortal myriads bless; And men, and saints, and angels own The sceptre of thy righteousness. And, ere this frame was yet begun, Of earth and ocean, sky and sea, God's word went forth, âThou art my Son,â This day have I begotten thee!â VI They, as a garment, shall wax oldâ Earth, air, and ocean, sun and sky,â Till, like a vesture, shalt thou fold Creation up, and cast it by. But thou shalt still the same remain, Triumphant over death and hell,â Secure from grief, remote from pain, Eternal and unchangeable. FROM THE GOSPEL. I In the beginning there was God alone: His immaterial glory fill'd all space, Its ancient and illimitable throne:â Substance was none;âno colour, form, or place; Not one of all night's countless orbs had shone As yet upon her still and rayless face; No sound had pierced the silence lone and deep, Telling of life, which still in Time's vast womb did sleep. II Then was the Word with Godâthe Word was God; Co-equalâco-eternalâco-divine, Myriads of ages ere Earth's soil was trod By man or seraph,âere a sun did shine, Impregnating with heat her teeming sod, And filling with rich ore the virgin mineâ Even then, in glory such as heart ne'er felt, Tongue spake, or thought conceived, the Son and Father dwelt. III Earth was created:âthe great fiat pass'd, âLet there be light:ââthat fiat spake the Wordâ Himself the light on each man's spirit cast; And when into our nostrils life was pour'd, He was that life;âyet when He came at last To his own worldâits Maker and its Lord,â That world received him not, and he was fain Over a few poor, faithful, scatter'd hearts to reign. IV Yet, to as many as received him, He Gave power, e'en then, to be the sons of God; Not through the pride of mortal ancestryâ Not for that they Earth's sacred places trodeâ Not for that men had will'd it so to beâ But that His grace, who quickeneth stone and clod, Made them partakers of a second birth, And denizens of Heaven, while yet they dwelt on Earth. V Thus was the Word made flesh, and with us dwelt, Here sojourning among the sons of men,â And all our joys and all our sorrows felt, Revealing daily to our mortal ken The glory of his Father,âso to melt Our stubborn hearts, and win them home again E'en to Himself;âfor us he felt such ruthâ He, God's own image, full of heavenly grace and truth! ST. STEPHEN'S DAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I Our mortal eyes are all too dim To see Heaven's countless seraphim Encamp'd Christ's Church around; Our mortal ears too dull to hear Angelic voices, close and clear, But in Earth's uproar drown'd. II We know not what bright myriads stand Invisible, but near at hand, To guard our narrow way;â What banners o'er us are unfurl'd,â How weak is he who rules the world To Him whom we obey! III And so a timorous war we wage, And plod through life's dull pilgrimage With laggard steps and slow; Beset by perils dark and drear, Trouble and toil, and doubt and fear, And ever varying woe. IV Yet moments, few and brief, have been When faith's enfranchised eye hath seen Beyond this mortal night;â When some strong effort of the heart Hath rent Earth's shadowy veil apart, And brought all Heaven in sight. V First of the martyrs!âthus to thee 'Twas given thy Saviour's self to see At God's right hand reveal'd; Whom once beheld, what marvel thou With patient cheer and stedfast brow Thy saintly soul shouldst yield? VI But we!âour eyes are dark with sin,â Mists, rising from foul depths within, Their else keen vision blind; And so in vain we struggle still With sluggish heart, and slavish will, And gross and sensual mind. VII Lord! on our darkling spirits shine With those refulgent beams of thine, Which kindle faith and love; That we thy presence may discern, And so, through earth's afflictions, learn To win our crown above. FROM THE GOSPEL. I A beauteous world is this of ours, Though dimm'd by sin's polluting stain; The earth looks bright with fruits and flowers, The skies with shifting sun and rain: The air is fresh with fragrant scent, And many a pleasant voice and sound Tells sweetly of deep-felt content In homes where peace and love abound. II Who would not say, if this were all, âThe temple of God's love is here; Gleams of his brightest glory fall From Heaven upon this favour'd sphereâ? And yetâbehold the lightning's pathâ The blazing roof, the blasted treeâ The tokens of avenging wrathâ Plague, famine, death, and misery! III Alas! from this, our beauteous earth, The cry of guilt to God hath risen; The world, which smiled on Adam's birth, Is now his sinful offspring's prison. There's not a green and flowery vale, There's not a pleasant grove or dell, But has its own peculiar tale Of agony and crime to tell. IV And yet o'er all our deeds of shame,â Of hate and vengeance, wrath and lust,â Of plunder'd cities wrapt in flameâ Of towers and temples ground to dust,â Of maids' and matrons' foulest wrongâ Of ruin'd hearth and reeking sod,â One cry arises, loud and long,â The death-cry of the saints of God! V The earth has drunk their gentle blood, And closed above their scatter'd bones; Rock, hill, and cavern, vale, and wood, Have echoed back their dying groans. In dungeons dark, in tortures dire, By axe and fagot, stone and sword, In whelming floods, in scorching fire, Their lives they yielded for their Lord. VI Through woods and wilds, o'er pathless rocks, They roam'd to shun the rage of men; They found a shelter with the fox, They dared the hungry lion's den; They sought and shared the raven's food, They slept beside the eagle's nest; By human hatred still pursued, And only in the grave at rest. VII And years and ages wax and wane,â But that fierce hate is quenchless still; And martyrs toil and bleed in vain To free mankind from grief and ill. The thirst of Cain for Abel's blood, The hate that slew the Lord of heaven, Still persecute the wise and goodâ Those sole offenders ne'er forgiven! VIII And shall not God avenge his own? âLook upâin all the louring sky The tokens of his wrath are shownâ He will avenge them speedily. For ruthless deeds of days long past, For saintly blood like water shed, Those gathering clouds shall burst at last, Ere many another age hath fled. IX The curse deferr'd at length draws nigh, Our guilty world beneath it shakes; It blights the earth, it blasts the sky, All flesh before its advent quakes. All human faces gather gloom, Fear hideth in the hearts of kings;â O Lord, protect thy Church from doom, Beneath thy mercy's sheltering wings. ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST'S DAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I A blessed lot was yours, Who dwelt with Christ below, And saw him work his heavenly cures On mortal pain and woe! Into whose charmed ears His human accents sank; Whose heart, oppress'd with griefs and fears, His looks of pity drank! II Those words of his we read, And feel their countless worth; And gladly yet our spirits feed On all he wrought on Earth. From Bethlehem's manger mean To Calvary's awful hill, We track him through each wondrous scene, As faith discerns it still. III But faith's intensest gaze Is all too weak and cold To pierce the thick and sensual haze Which doth our hearts enfold. Almost God's written word Those craving hearts despiseâ It cannot give the tones ye heard, The looks that bless'd your eyes. IV Unkind and selfish men! Ye might have told us more (For God's own Spirit warm'd your pen) Of Him whom all adore. His voiceâhis formâhis glanceâ His stature fair and tall,â The glories of his countenanceâ Ye might have told them all. V Among your tribes was none,â Not one poor limner found, Who might pourtray that heavenly One With Earth's rich beauty crown'd? Could no kind art have left The strains of that last hymn, Whose parting tones your bosoms cleft Near Cedron's hallow'd brim? VI So might our eyes have dwelt On that divinest brow; So might our thrilling hearts have felt Those heavenly accents now. That face o'er home and hearth Might cheering light have flung, And Christians still enjoy'd on Earth The strains their Saviour sung. VII âO! murmurs base and vain! (Heaven's martyr'd saints reply) And foolish tongues that thus complain! And foolish hearts that sigh! What lack ye now of all That we enjoy'd of old? What light could on our spirits fall Which yours may not behold?â VIII He spake with us on Earthâ He speaks to you from Heaven; Is with you in your grief and mirthâ Hath all your sins forgiven: To bear his words to you Our strength and lives we gave; That ye might know what once we knew, We dared the martyr's grave. IX Our toils are over now, And yours will soon be done; Keep patient heart and stedfast brow Till faith's good fight be won. Walk boldly in the light, And so your prize pursue, For God's own glory gilds the night Which yet looks dark for you. X Deem not the gospel's sway As yet hath slain your sin, Nor wash'd its crimson stains away, Nor cleansed the founts within. Before God's altar kneel, To Him your sins confess, And He your hearts shall cleanse and heal From all unrighteousness. FROM THE GOSPEL. âIf I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?â I Art thou still on Earth a rover? Shar'st thou still some mortal home, Though life's task hath long been over, Tarrying till thy Lord shall come? Still unchanged in human beauty, Breathing still our human breath, Stedfast still at all Earth's duty, Only free from pain and death? II Thou whom once the Lord of glory Chose his earthly friend to beâ Meekest saint of Christian story, Gentle child of Zebedeeâ Still do Earth's gross fetters bind thee? Is thy rest not yet begun? Where, O where, may Christians find thee? In what land beneath the sun? III Art thou still, unheeded, roaming On the Galilean shore, Where Gennesareth's waves are foaming, Which thy bark so often bore? Dost thou still delight to wander Through the paths thy Saviour trod; Where with thee he loved to ponder On the ways and works of God? IV In the city sad and saintly,â On the Temple's blasted site,â When the stars are burning faintly, Dost thou oft outwatch the night? How must Salem's ruins move thee!â All is changed on Zion's hill; Heaven alone is bright above thee, And its fires unfaded still. V Or, in Patmos isle secluded, View'st thou, with prophetic eye, Things whereinto ne'er intruded Holiest angel known on high? Swiftly now the days are waning Which thy mystic lips foretold; Soon thy Lord, in glory reigning, Shall thy weary eyes behold. VI Hath our own bright isle beheld thee, Shrouded in some garb obscure? Have we from our doors repell'd thee, For that thou wast old and poor? Faint, perchance, and worn and weary, Toiling on from clime to climeâ Still thou view'st one prospect dreary,â Waning faith and waxing crime. VII Sick, perchance, in heart and spirit At the ceaseless strife and change Which Earth's ancient realms inheritâ Westward thou hast turn'd to range. There, where nature's smiles are kindestâ Where our race is in its youthâ Tell us if, e'en there, thou findest Holier love or purer truth? VIII Doth thy bark, with gentlest motion, Where the smooth Pacific smiles, Bear thee o'er the breast of ocean, Visiting its myriad isles? There, in joy and triumph sailing, Dost thou pass from shore to shore, Where young faith is yet prevailing, Where false gods are found no more? IX Idle dreams! though passing pleasant To the fond and foolish heart, Which on Earth would deem thee present, Though in heavenly bliss thou art. He who here vouchsafed to love thee, He who held thee on his breast, Breathes eternal peace above thee, In the chambers of his rest. X Dreamy sounds, from earth ascending, Tell thee of our strife below; How the Church is still contending With unvanquish'd sin and woe. Heaven's remotest depths must hide thee, Till her victory be won;â There may we repose beside thee, When our earthly toils are done! THE INNOCENTS' DAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I Through Heaven's bright depths profound Float waves of golden soundâ Voices of mingled love, and joy and wonder; Like harps that smite the ear, 'Midst waters murmuring near, And the deep rolling of the distant thunder. Seraphs and saints are chaunting some new song, Which, round Jehovah's throne, Heaven's echoing vaults prolong. II On Zion's topmost brow Bright hosts are gathering nowâ Twelve times twelve thousand, each a sceptred saint! Each bears his Father's name In lines of dazzling flame, Writ on his forehead;âyet that blaze grows faint Beneath the o'erpowering glory of the Lamb Throned in the midstâthe Oneâthe infinite I AM. III And hark! with one accord, To greet Heaven's sovereign Lord, That countless host its mighty voice doth raise; A loud and thrilling song Peals through the immortal throngâ A song of holy love, and joy and praise: A song which none may learn but such as be Enroll'd among that bright and blessed company. IV Those blissful sounds to hear, Heaven stoops its charmed ear,â Angels themselves their choral songs suspending; While blessed souls that sleep In peace serene and deep, Feel the wild music with their visions blending. But even angelic voices are too dull To imitate those strainsâso wild and wonderful. V Ye crowned heads that wait In calm and saintly state, (White-vested elders) round the eternal throne; Declare, if that ye may, What glorious hosts are they, From whose bright lips these wond'rous sounds have flown? Why can none learn the words of that strange song, Nor chaunt the heavenly notes which waft those words along? VI âEarth's holiest sons are these, Who (so their Lord to please) Refrain'd on earth from joys of earthly love; By woman undefiled, Each like a sinless child Follow'd his Master to his rest above; Nor e'er did passion's sensual paths pursue, Nor e'er the wanton joys of amorous dalliance knew. VII âThese calm'd, with stedfast will, Desire's intemperate thrill, E'en in the May of their impetuous blood; Nor let vain Fancy's play Their senses steal away; Nor sank beneath the might of womanhood: But firmly put Earth's baser love aside, So best to live to Him for them on Earth who died. VIII âNo feverish hopes and fears Disturb'd their prime of years, Nor from their heart's serene devotion drave; Nor foul suspicion's breath, Nor passion, strong as death, Nor jealousy, more cruel than the grave, Marr'd the composure of their tranquil mind, Nor could their eagle wings of heavenly musing bind. IX âNor knew they the turmoil Of household cares or toil, For wife and children daily bread to win; Nor love's capricious wiles And shifting frowns and smiles, Once snared them into act or thought of sin, While, with fond zeal, to please a wife they strove, Neglecting His high cause who claim'd their hearts above. X âTherefore, with perfect will, They served their Master still, Nor e'er, on Earth, forgot their heavenly prize; Through clouds of trouble dim, By faith, discerning Him Whom yet they saw not with their fleshly eyes: For his dear sake Earth's fiercest hate defied,â Lived but to work his will, and for his glory died. XI âNow all their toils are o'er, And sense and lust no more Disturb or sadden their serene repose; But, with Heaven's glories crown'd, They near the Lamb are found, And track his footsteps wheresoe'er he goes; Still in his wake, with rapturous flight, ascending, Through worlds of dazzling light and bliss that knows no ending. XII âAnd that blest song, they sing, With which Heaven's chambers ring, As with the fabled music of the spheres, Breathes no dull tone of earthâ No thought that e'er had birth In the gross world of carnal hopes and fears: But hymns the passion of a virgin love, Which such alone conceive even in these realms above.â XIII Ah! woe!âmust only they,â (White-vested elders say,) Must only they their Lord's pure joy partake? And we, who toil below Through mortal grief and woe, Bearing the cross for his beloved sakeâ Must we ne'er learn the wonders of that strain, For that we wore, on earth, soft wedlock's easy chain? XIV And that, around our hearth, The laugh of childhood's mirth And matron voices of meek rule were heard; And that the nuptial bed Was in our chambers spread, And that our hearts were innocently stirr'd By woman's gentle words and cheering smile; And that her tender love did all our cares beguile? XV Is it our sin, that we, In gentlest sympathy, Thro' life's dark paths each other cheer'd along, And felt the bitter dearth Of children snatch'd from Earth, To join their voices to that choral song? Can chastest love our path so foully mar, As e'en Heaven's brightest courts against our souls to bar? XVI âO base and foolish plaints!ââ (Thus those white-vested saints With dreamlike voice upbraidingly reply;) âO murmurs base and vain, Which Heaven's high will arraign! And sinful hearts which with the sinless vie! Low, sensual spirits, which would take your fill Of Earth's most luscious joys, yet reign with martyrs still! XVII âIs't not enough that ye Have power on earth to be Emblems and types of Christ's eternal love; Fond husband and chaste wife, In pure connubial life, The Church pourtraying and her spouse above? Is't not enough to know that you shall share In heaven the fullest bliss that blessed souls can bear? XVIII âYour own hard task fulfil, And meekly do God's will, Cheer'd by the comforts which his love hath given; It may be that the hours Here spent in wedlock's bowers, Shall shed rich fragrance o'er your homes in heaven; And love's bright flowers, which bloom so feebly here, Burst into full-blown bliss in Heaven's congenial sphere. XIX âSo let each soul possess, In faith and holiness, Its proper gift of Godâand still let all, With reverence due, give place To those whom ampler grace Doth to sublimer self-denial call; Who, self-subdued, best purge from earthly leaven Those founts of holy thought which fit the soul for Heaven.â FROM THE GOSPEL. I âThrough the desert wild and dreary, Following tracks explored by few, Sad at heart, and worn and weary, We our toilsome march pursue. O'er our heads, with blaze unclouded, Burns the fierce and fiery noon; Pestilence, in darkness shrouded, Near us walks beneath the moon. II âO'er the steep and pathless mountain Oft with bleeding feet we climb; Scarce to taste the desert fountain Human hate allows us time. Israel's homes lie far behind us, Yet we pause not to look back, Lest the keen pursuer find us, Lest grim murder scent our track. III âEagles o'er our heads are wheeling, Each careering towards her nest; E'en the wolf and fox are stealing To the covert of their rest; Every foul and noxious creature Finds on earth its lair and bed;â But the infant Lord of Nature Hath not where to lay his head. IV âYet, my babe, sweet sleep enfolds thee On thy fainting mother's arm; God, in his great love, beholds thee, Angels guard thy rest from harm; Earth and hell in vain beset thee, Kings against thy life conspire; But our God can ne'er forget thee, Nor His arm, that shields thee, tire. V âWhere is now our peaceful dwelling? âWrapt perchance in vengeful flame; Ruffian voices round it yelling, Curses on thy gentle name. Woe to Bethlehem's matrons, keeping Tenderest watch above their dead! Rachel, for her children weeping, Knows not to be comforted. VI âWoe to them!âand yet their anguish Fades before what mine must be; Doom'd to see my lov'd one languish Through this life's long misery. Doom'd to see Earth's hate expended On his meek and lowly head, Till his weary task is endedâ Till his sinless blood is shed. VII âHeavenly hope shall soothe their sorrow, When the grass begins to wave, After many a dreary morrow, Freshly o'er each infant grave. I alone, to rest a stranger, Must behold, with aching eye, O'er my child distress and danger Gathering still incessantly. VIII âBut forbear, my sinful spirit, Of thy chastening to complain; Gladly let me here inherit Toil and sorrow, care and pain! Welcome Earth's most dread vexations! Welcome anguish and distress! Since my name all generations For a Saviour's love shall bless!â THE SUNDAY AFTER CHRISTMAS DAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I The childhood of our race is o'er, Its youghful prime hath faded long; Man's ripening mind delights no more In dream and vision, tale and song. The dawning hope, the fond belief, The novelty of life are fled; And all is sober, joy and grief, And phantasy and faith are dead. II The rites which pleased our Nature's youth, While heart and mind were childish stillâ The earthly types of heavenly truth,â The altars of the grove and hill,â The saintly pompâthe annual feastâ The sounds of sacred dance and hymn,â The sacrifice of bird and beastâ These rites are o'erâthese splendours dim. III Our reason, disenthrall'd at length From youthful fancies, fond and vain, Comes forth, released by manhood's strength, From governor's and tutor's reign. The shadowy types of mystic lore Content not now our mental eye, Whose quenchless gaze would fain explore All wonders of all worlds on high. IV And must man's spirit vainly pant For purest truth to learn and love? Still groan beneath its earthly want Of fellowship with things above? âNot so!âthe teeming womb of Time Hath travail'd with a wondrous birth; God's Son hath come, in love sublime, His brethren to redeem on earth. V And for that we, through sin subdued, Are sons of God and heirs of heaven, Our Father, to each heart renew'd, The spirit of a son hath given. The soul's long servitude hath ceased,â Not now, like slaves, we crouch and cower, But on our Father's bounty feast,â Enjoy His love, adore His power. FROM THE GOSPEL. I âThou wast to me the brightest dream That e'er upon my spirit shone; Alas! and is that heavenly gleam For ever lost and gone? And do I live?âand can it be That thou a shameless wanton art, Who wast the type of purity To this fond, foolish heart? II âI thought, ere yet I dared to love, That thou wast scarce an earth-born thing; Thy mortal grace so tower'd above Earth's best imagining. Almost it seem'd profane to press The ground on which thy feet had trod,â Their path was mark'd with holiness, As by the steps of God. III âAnd when my heart grew bold at last, And perfect love had banish'd fear, And gentle hope grew fair and fast For many a pleasant yearâ It was a joy I may not tell The beauty of thy soul to see, And, in my fondest thought, to dwell On its pure harmony. IV âAh me!âhow like a glimpse of Heaven The day of our betrothal seem'd, When first a pledge to love was given Of all that hope had dream'd! And I thenceforth might think of thee When to my daily toil I went, As doom'd in after years to be My star of home content! V âCan she, (I thought) so fair and good, Partake a base mechanic's lot, The light of loveliest womanhood Diffusing through his cot? Can she, whose heart is all above, A poor man's bride consent to be, And rear, with meek and patient love, His lowly progeny? VI âBut thou didst so benignly smile, And speak with such a gentle toneâ Ah! meâthat voice might sure beguile An angel from his throne! And all thy words, and all thy ways, And all thy looks so heavenly were; 'Twas heaven into thine eyes to gazeâ Thy mortal love to share! VII âAnd wast thou then a sensual thing,â A heartless wanton, light and vain?â Such thoughts o'erwhelm my heart, and fling Distraction on my brain. No, noâit must not, cannot beâ Thy looks bespeak a virgin heart, The wanton's gestures suit not thee, Nor yet the wanton's art. VIII âThou dost not quail before my glanceâ And yet thine own is modest still; Thy calm and radiant countenance Betrays no thought of ill. I cannot scan thy secret soul, Nor read the unfathom'd depths within; But ne'er did looks like those controul The restless pulse of sin. IX âAnd yetâthose fatal proofs of guilt!â Alas! too plain a tale they tell;â O! that my life-blood had been spilt Ere thus my loved one fell! And I!âshall I that fall proclaim? Make public all her guilty deeds? Consigning Her to scorn and shame For whom my spirit bleeds? X âNo, Maryâmy crush'd heart may break, But thou shalt still uninjured be; If vengeance e'er thy faults o'ertake, It shall not come from me. Thou wast my hopeâmy prideâmy bliss, I will not now divulge thy shame, Nor point the common scoffer's hiss At thy beloved name.â XI Such thoughts, perchance, in turbid stream O'er Joseph's burden'd spirit crept; But that same night a blessed dream Came to him as he slept:â And when he from his sleep arose, With steadfast heart and cheerful brow, Like one whose hopes on God repose, He pledged his nuptial vow. XII In pure and reverent love he dwelt With her his own, his chosen bride; Nor all a bridegroom's fervour felt, Nor slumber'd by her side. He shared with her his peasant's cot, He watch'd her fondly night and morn, But still approach'd her chamber not Until her babe was born. THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST. FROM THE EPISTLE. I The world may look serene and bright, Our path bestrewn with choicest flowers; And days of love and home-delight, And nights of healthful rest be ours. From worldly strife and worldly care The heart a safe repose may win, And yet feel all too weak to bear The burden of unpardon'd sin. II The mists of grief but rarely dim The glorious light of childhood's skies; Life tingles in its every limb, Health speaks and sparkles in its eyes: Yet, e'en among its sports and toys A cloud is gathering on its brow; Stern conscience soon will blast the joys Which steep the soul in gladness now. III Through many a green, secluded walk, In life and hope's delicious May, Engross'd in love's unwearying talk, Fond youths and happy maidens stray. Earth hath not a diviner bliss On gentle spirits to bestow; Yet boast notâfor alas! e'en this Unpardon'd sin converts to woe. IV The pleasant noise of children's mirth Makes glad our sober middle age; Bright faces, round the evening hearth, The day's heart-wasting cares assuage. But wife and children's sweetest smileâ The light that on our hearts doth fallâ The love that doth our griefs beguileâ Unpardon'd sin can poison all. V With steadfast thought and cheerful toil The mines of learning we explore, And waste our patient midnight oil O'er many a page of ancient lore. We seek and earn the sage's name, We feel the sage's pride within; But all our wisdom, all our fame, Lie crush'd beneath unpardon'd sin. VI We give our hearts to humankind, With liberal bounty we dispense To fainting flesh and weary mind The streams of our benevolence. And poor men's tongues our kindness bless, And earth and air our praises fill; But, in the spirit's loneliness, Unpardon'd sin consumes it still. VII Heâhe alone is truly blest Whom God hath from this burden freed; Whose doubts and fears are lull'd to rest, Whose peace of heart is peace indeed: Who, strong in faith, can lift to heaven A tranquil and undaunted brow; Who knows and feels his sin forgiven, His soul's dark warfare ended now. VIII And who are they on whom alone Descends this blessing from above? To whom their Father hath made known These tokens of especial love? The Jew by circumcision's rite?â The Christian by baptismal sign?â On these doth more celestial light Than on less favour'd spirits shine? IX Nor outward sign, nor mystic rite, Alone such blessings can confer;â To walk by faith, and not by sightâ Like Abraham's self a worshipper,â To count all earthly gain but loss,â To look and long to be forgiven Through Him who died upon the crossâ Thisâthis unlocks the gates of heaven. FROM THE GOSPEL. I The angels' song was ended, Sweet stillness fill'd the air, Through which to Heaven ascended The shepherds' silent prayer. They gazed on one another,â Strange thoughts were rife in them; Then each cried, âUp, my brother! Away to Bethlehem! II âOur sheep, in safety feeding Upon the mountain side, Beneath the watch-dog's leading May wander far and wide. From heat, and frost, and thunder, God shelter flock and fold! While we this work of wonder Are journeying to behold.â III Forthwith each sturdy ranger To Bethlehem took his way; And soon they found the manger Wherein the Saviour lay. They bow'd the knee before him, Those simple men and true; They bless'd the womb that bore him, The breast whose milk he drew. IV No sign of kingly splendour Did that poor hovel grace; But love, devout and tender, Had sanctified the place: For there the saintly mother, The virgin undefiled, In bliss she could not smother, Was gazing on her child. V And, keeping watch above her, In rapt and heavenly mood, Her husband, friend, and lover, Stout-hearted Joseph stood. Such bliss no mortal father E'er felt for his first-born, As faith began to gather In his pure soul that morn. VI And, as in smiling slumber That blessed infant lay, Bright visions without number About him seem'd to play. And in that lowly dwelling A stillness, hush'd and dim, Seem'd of the presence telling Of viewless seraphim. VII They came and they departed, Those simple, holy men; And each felt joyful-hearted As home he fared again: But oft in thought they wander'd To all they left behind; While Mary kept and ponder'd Their visit in her mind. THE EPIPHANY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I Angelic tongues would be too weak, Angelic hearts too cold, The wonders of God's love to speak, So deep and manifold. Heaven's principalities and powers Are gazing on this world of ours, His counsel to behold, Which, since creation's morn, hath been Unfolding on this mortal scene. II The strife in which we here engage With Hell's rebellious host, The warfare which the Church doth wage, Hath Heaven's whole heart engross'd: E'en as the news of foes' descent, In fierce invading armament, On some far island coast, With one intense, tumultuous thrill May rouse an empire's heart and will. III We know not but each brave repulse Which foils the Tempter here, Forbids his legions to convulse Full many a brighter sphere. But this we knowâthat since, on Earth, Sin's foul and monstrous womb gave birth To grief, and pain, and fear, The wisdom and deep love of Heaven Against hell's noxious brood have striven. IV At first, in dark mysterious guise, That wisdom lay conceal'd; Obscurely to prophetic eyes As in a glass reveal'd. But now the veil of Hebrew lore Can dim its glorious light no more; And Abraham's race must yield The rights, which theirs no more may be, To all Earth's countless progeny. V And, day and night, o'er land and sea, Is spreading, far and fast, The knowledge of Christ's mystery, Close hid in ages past. And who are they who tell the tale? Who, heaven-commission'd, rend the veil O'er all the nations cast? And cause the light of truth divine On man's sin-darken'd soul to shine? VI Not seraphs, as ye well might deem, With souls and tongues of flame; Whose utterance yet too weak would seem That mystery to proclaim: Not prophets from the grave arisen, To groan once more in fleshly prison; Not saints, who overcame, Through Jesus' blood, the infernal powers Which yet besiege these hearts of ours. VII Ah! no!âthe messengers of peace Themselves are sinners still; Who scarce, e'en yet, have found release For weary heart and will. Fast bound in Satan's devilish thrall, Christ's love aroused them, one and all, And sent them forth to fill His marriage-feast with guests, and tell Of his rich love, unsearchable. VIII The words they speak are faint and few, And scarce, at times, find vent; Yet can the strongest hearts subdue, With might omnipotent. For from the spirit's depths they start, And wing their way from heart to heart, As though the speaker meant, In that deep utterance, to reveal A love he cannot choose but feel. IX And through that love, sent down from Heaven To dwell in hearts new-born, Shall sin at last from Earth be driven, And Death of terror shorn. The weapons of our warfare here Are faith, and hope, and holy fear; âLet these our souls adorn; And Earth shall soon, like Heaven, confess Christ's reign of peace and righteousness. FROM THE GOSPEL. I Fair Star! whose orient beauty, In patient love and duty, Thro' many a sultry clime the pilgrim-sages led; Whose beams, serene and tender, First stay'd their waning splendour Above the lowly stable where our Lord had laid his head;â II Bright, tranquil child of morning! Who gav'st the earliest warning Of that more glorious Sun, e'en then about to rise;â From light's eternal fountains, O'er Earth's remotest mountains, First heralding the blaze of day, which soon should fill the skies! III What wast thou, wandering planet? âThy course,âO! whence began it? In what dim, distant tract of unimagined space Did thy Creator form thee? Did first the sunbeams warm thee? Did Nature's law project thee on thy swift and ceaseless race? IV Ah! sure, no glimmering meteor Wast thouâEarth's noxious creature, From dank, unwholesome dews and fetid vapours bred; No comet fiercely glaring, Men's hearts for war preparing, And shaking, from its horrid hair, hate, pestilence, and dread. V Faith's eye alone could view theeâ Faith's foot alone pursue theeâ So thou didst safely guide those pilgrims on their way; While yet thou wouldst not render One glimpse of faintest splendour To light stern Herod's ruffian bands to seize their infant prey. VI Perchance some new creation, By sudden revelation Wast thou, to mortal eyes, then first made manifest; Some home of souls departed, The holy, humble-hearted, For ever floating blissfully,âan island of the blest! VII And when thy task was over, Thy beauty thou didst cover With azure folds of sky, and, hid from mortal eyes, O'er ether's boundless ocean Resume thy destined motion Through space where other systems roll, and other suns arise. VIII Ah! wherefore thus forsake us? When pain and grief o'ertake us, Why not, from time to time, thy cheering light unveil? On many a night of sorrow Presaging glad to-morrow To hearts that faint beneath their load, and eyes that, weeping, fail? IX Where lonely saints are kneeling, From godless eyes concealing The weight which this world's sin doth on their spirits layâ Where, in prophetic study, Until the east grows ruddy, All night pale scholars wake and watch for Christ's long promised dayâ X Where ships, in endless motion, Plough through the plains of ocean, The messengers of peace to heathen lands to bearâ Where, English homes forsaking, Brave hearts are slowly waking, In savage haunts and gloomy wilds, the voice of Christian prayerâ XI Where Heaven's elect assembleâ Where sinful spirits trembleâ Where first the stricken soul finds strength and voice to prayâ Where, round some widow'd father, Half orphan'd children gather Beside their sainted mother's graveâO why withhold thy ray? XII For what more blessed token To hearts, by sorrow broken, Of pardon seal'd in heaven and future rest could be? What surer sign could find us, In trouble to remind us Of Christ's protecting light and loveâthan that reveal'd in thee? XIII Soul!âsoul!âforbear such questions,â Poor fancy's wild suggestions,â Vain longings of the sense to feed its carnal eye; What boots it that Man's spirit Faith's treasures doth inherit, If yet it cleaves so fondly to its old idolatry? XIV No blaze of sensual glory, Intense but transitory, Could the heart's craving thirst for purer light allay; Even thine, fair star, returning, Would but increase our yearning, Which nought on earth could satisfy, for Heaven's unclouded day. XV Yet fond imagination, By many a bright creation, With shadowy types of Heaven can people Earth's domain; Still shaping and combining, From all things sweet and shining, Memorials of immortal love to soothe our mortal pain. XVI The rainbow, in its splendour, To hearts devout and tender Still yields a glorious pledge of deepest sin forgiven; The dawn's outbreaking whiteness, The sunset's fading brightness, Shed gleams of glory on the earth as from our homes in Heaven. XVII And when morn's star ascending, Its pearly light is blending With the pale, silver tints of the still sunless sky, May fancy's eye discover Thine orb, blest star, above her, Bright as when first it usher'd in the day-spring from on high. XVIII Thus air, and earth, and ocean, To hearts of calm devotion, Rich founts of cheering thought and holy comfort prove; All things are theirs for ever, Nor life nor death shall sever Their faith and patience here below from Christ's eternal love. FIRST SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I Hast thou believed, poor mortal child of sorrow,â O! hast thou felt thy grievous plague within? Hath thy crush'd heart e'er vainly long'd to borrow Rest and relief from the dull weight of sin? Hast thou retraced, with shame and consternation, The paths thy spirit, since its birth, hath trod? Hast thou conceived, in faint imagination, The wrath of God? II Know'st thou His powerâHis works of fear and wonder, Creator of all worlds, sole Lord of Heaven, Whose glance is lightning, and whose voice is thunder; Beneath whose breath hills quake, and rocks are riven? Kings lick the dust before Him,âmightiest nations, Thrones, empires, at his pleasure, wax and wane; Man's countless tribes, through all their generations, Confess His reign. III Know'st thou His holiness?âBehold! before Him The angels veil their brows of living light; Heaven's holiest children tremblingly adore Him; Not Heaven itself is spotless in his sight. No sinful thought, no wandering dream of folly, The terrors of his presence may endure; The King of saints is Heâthe Lord most holy, And just, and pure! IV And what art thou, poor sinful human creature, Inheritor of guilt, and shame, and woe? Thy brightness soil'd, defaced each glorious feature, Which once His image on thy soul did show? Despiser of his laws! insane reviler Of His great name! wild rebel to His will! Of thine own soul the unrestrain'd defiler! Yet scatheless still! V Why art thou spared?âwhat potent intercessor Averts from thee His oft uplifted arm? Why, on this earth, so reckless a transgressor, Liv'st thou and breathest, free from mortal harm? The sun shines on, the rains still fall to bless thee; Heaven's brightnessâEarth's affections still are thine; Fond bosoms heave, and gentle arms caress thee In tenderest twine. VI And ever and anon, amidst Earth's pleasures, Thou hear'st a voiceâa still small voice of love, From these vain pomps and these decaying treasures Wooing thy soul to fairer hopes above: And, 'midst thy darkest deeds of shame and terror, God's Spirit whispers to thy secret ear, âThis is the wayâoh! quit those paths of error, And walk thou here!â VII And thou art still encompass'd by His people, And saints, perchance, weep for thee, night and day; And Sabbath chimes ring out from tower and steeple, In His own house inviting thee to pray. And Christ still sends thee his appointed teachers, Still proffers to thee his own flesh and blood; Entreats, persuades, by pastors and by preachers, Thy wayward mood. VIII O! close not thou thine ear, nor madly darken Thy heart by reckless counsel, vain and wild; But to those words of mercy meekly hearken, E'en like a gentle and submissive child. Think how all heaven hath been convulsed to save thee, Vile as thou art, from hell's eternal death! Think how God's Sonâhis sole begotten, gave thee His dying breath! IX Think on the Virgin's womb!âon Bethlehem's manger! God condescending to a peasant's birth! Think on that life of grief, distress, and danger!â His toils, his tears, his troubles here on Earth! Think on that desert fast!âthat lone temptation!â Think on the anguish of Gethsemane!â Think on the bitter cup, to win salvation, Endured for thee! X For thee!âfor thee!âthe lostâthe unconverted,â The grief of angelsâhell's close-guarded prize!â But for his love by Heaven itself deserted! Doom'd prey to that fierce worm which never dies! And wilt thou still resist his deep compassion? By new rebellions his slow wrath provoke? Nay!âto His will thy spirit meekly fashion, And bear his yoke. XI Yield up thy body, once sin's willing servant, To Him a living sacrificeâto Him Give heart, soul, thought, in love devout and fervent; Join, with thy voice, His choir of seraphim. Thy health, thy strength, the glory and the beauty Of all thine inner man, with stedfast will, Submit henceforth to the calm rule of duty, And serve Him still. XII Be not conform'd to this world's varying humour, Its love, its hate, its folly, or its pride; Court not, and fear not, the foul breath of rumour; Be to Earth's pomps and pleasures crucified. Bow thy soul meekly to the Spirit's guiding, Welcome his pure transforming influence; Till Christ shall reign, in power and grace abiding, O'er soul and sense. XIII Walk humbly before God, and with thy neighbour; Be wisdom's lowliest and most docile child; Counting it ample fruit of all thy labour That thou to God, through Christ, art reconciled. Be One in faith and hope, in heart and spirit, With His true members, and in patient love Do thine own task, that so thou may'st inherit Their bliss above. FROM THE GOSPEL. I The solemn joyance of the paschal feast In Salem's thousand homes was over now; The melody of Psalms had sunk and ceased, And sacrifice, and prayer, and offer'd vow Were mute on Zion's Temple-crested brow; Through the throng'd gates was passing many a train Of pilgrims, who had come their knees to bow, In annual homage, at Jehovah's fane, And now with peaceful steps were wending home again. II At that year's feast men's spirits had been stirr'd Beyond their wonted fervour;âfar and near, Throughout the city, grave discourse was heard, Breathing expectance not unmix'd with fear; And friends, who met around their paschal cheer, Spake each to each, in low and solemn tone, Of Him who, all were hoping, should appear, Ere many another passover had flown, O'er Israel's race redeem'd to rear his promised throne. III And hoary rabbis, who had spent their youth And the calm fervour of their middle age In learned study of prophetic truth, Met and conversed, in conference deep and sage, On what God's oracles did now presage; Computing how the years were nigh fulfill'd, Foreshown long since in Daniel's mystic page, Whereon high hopes did men securely build, That soon Messiah's star should now the horizon gild. IV And hearts which long had for deliverance sigh'd From the stern pressure of Rome's iron sway, Felt as if soon they should not need to hide The swelling hope, which deep within them lay, That Israel's bondage now should pass away, And brighter glory than her morn had seen Gladden the progress of her later day, When she of all the nations should be Queen, And to Earth's utmost bounds extend her sway serene. V And among those of the unlearned sort, The wild fore-shadowing of their hearts' desire Found copious vent in many a strange report Of signs in Heaven,âof blood and smoke, and fire, Betokening to the Earth convulsion dire; Of meteors kindling all the Eastern sky; Of yawning graves, and ghosts in bright attire, Who through the city walk'd nocturnally, And spake of change to come, and freedom drawing nigh. VI And thus, on all the city's mighty heart, A breathless hush of expectation dwelt; And tears, unbidden, to men's eyes would start As they, in fervent supplication, knelt Before God's altar; and what each man felt His neighbour in his eyes full well might read, Till into words fond hope began to meltâ âIs Christ then born?âhath he been seen indeed? Doth God vouchsafe at last to heal his people's need?â VII But the feast ended, and Christ had not come; So, by degrees, hope's fever was allay'd, And all dispersedâeach rustic to his home, Each townsman to his craft or to his trade. Such termination life's dull labours made To anxious speculation;âthey meanwhile, The dwellers afar off, began to lade Their beasts, and homeward fared for many a mile, In cheerful, pleasant talk, which did the way beguile. VIII And thus tow'rd East and West, and South and North, Thro' Salem's every gate, from morn to night, Youth, manhood, and old age were issuing forth; In sooth a solemn and affecting sight! Beneath those myriads hill and dale were white As unto harvest, while each several breast With its own treasure of glad thoughts felt light; For each had done Jehovah's high behest, So winning for itself abiding peace and rest. IX Amidst the humbler wayfarers were two, Husband and wifeâa noticeable pair, Who northward their long journey did pursue; Calm and devout their aspect and their air; She, amidst Judah's daughters, passing fair, And now in the full bloom of matron prime; Yet, on her saintly forehead, did she bear Traces of thought more holy and sublime Than our dull hearts can reach in all their mortal time. X Upon an ass sedately did she ride, Which for their travel scant provision bore; While, staff in hand, her husband by her side Cheer'd her with loving solace evermore. âThus pleasantly away the daylight wore, And now, for weary beast and wearier man, Until the morrow, must their toil be o'er; And, halting for the night, the caravan To pitch its lowly tents right joyfully began. XI Then suddenly, amidst that motley crowd, A strange yet pleasant turmoil might be seen; And busy voices, clamouring long and loud, Lent their shrill discord to a wilder scene Than e'er our quiet clime beheld, I ween; As each small group its own encampment chose, By bubbling fount or palm-tree broad and green, Where each, or ere the gathering shades should close, Prepared its evening meal and night's secure repose. XII To each his separate province was assign'd; Some spread the viands forth in neat array; Some for their beasts the freshest pasture find; Some kindle watchfires, so to scare away From the small camp each prowling beast of prey; Some for the outposts choose their turns by lot, That so the rest may sleep secure till day: No separate charge or caution was forgot, To guard from foes' assault that lone, sequester'd spot. XIII Meanwhile that grave-eyed couple, each for each, Their coarse and scanty supper did prepare, With gentle interchange of loving speech,â Sweet condiment, I ween, to sorriest fare! Then spake the matron, âMuch I marvel where Tarrieth our child, who never, till to-night, Hath fail'd our labour, or our meal, to share; Why comes he not to bless our longing sight? Strange he should leave us now in this wayfaring plight! XIV âFair as he is beyond the sons of Earth, In form and feature, as in heart and will,â Divine in wisdom, as divine by birth; Yet hath he been, in love and duty, still The meekest child that ever did fulfil A parent's bidding; nor hath either heart (Thine, Joseph, or mine own) been fain to thrill, Since he was born, with one such grievous smart As oft, for children's sins, makes parents' tears to start. XV âWhy comes he not?âwhy now, at last, neglect His parents' needs?âwhy leave us thus to bring (As if through heedless sloth or disrespect) Leaves for our couch, and water from the spring To quench our thirst?âwhy suffer us to fling Our weary limbs upon their earthy bed Without a blessing?âsure, he would not wring Our hearts with wilful wrong or causeless dread;â O! lives he yet on earth, or rests among the dead?â XVI Thus the pale mother, in her anguish, spake, With trembling voice and tear-suffused eye; To whom her husband: âO! forbear to make Thy fond heart sad with causeless agony. His time, thou know'st, is not yet come to die; His earthly trials scarcely are begun:â Somewhere he loiters in our company; For few there be who joy not to have won, By most enticing arts, the presence of thy son. XVII âHaply with gracious and persuasive speech, And wisdom riper than his tender age, Tho' all unlearn'd, some neighbour doth he teach The import deep of some prophetic page;â Or, it may be, less serious tasks engage His gentle spirit;âon the beaten track He may have wander'd from our pilgrimage, To feed his thought, which food doth never lack, On Nature's wondrous worksâand soon will he come back.â XVIII Thus he his anxious consort mildly cheer'd: But the sun set, and moon and stars arose, While yet their missing child had not appear'd; And now the caravan in deep repose At length was hush'd;âthey only could not close Their aching eyelids;âthe fond mother's breast Then first experienced all a mother's woes, And, as each lay in comfortless unrest, Did many a wild surmise their anxious minds molest. XIX Scarce did the dawn above the mountains peep Ere these sad mourners from their couch had sprung, When scarce an eye, save theirs, had banish'd sleepâ And, with imploring looks and anxious tongue, Wander'd from tent to tent their friends among. ââO! tarrieth not our gentle child with you?â Thus still they ask'd, and still their hearts were wrung With bitterest disappointment, and anew Did they their restless search, with faltering steps, pursue. XX In vain!âno eye had seen that glorious boy Since from the city gates the train had past, And other cares did now all thoughts employ; âEach to his own loved home was hastening fast. The weary parents stay'd their search at last, And toward Jerusalem retraced their way, While many an anxious glance to Heaven they cast, And ever and anon did humbly pray That from their feverish lips this cup might pass away. XXI So to the Holy City back they went, Fearless, though unprotected; for what dread E'er touch'd a parent's spirit while intent On a child's loss, perchance untimely dead? And they moreover on their journey sped, Trusting, with all their hearts, to Heaven's high love, Which still had saved them, when of old they fled Before fierce Herod's wrath, and from above Warn'd them, in dreams, which way and when their steps should move. XXII But vain was all their toil:âin crowded street, In lonely grove and garden, mount and hill, In mart where buyers and where sellers meet, On Cedron's marge, by clear Siloam's rill,â They search'd and search'd with fruitless labour still; Their truant child could nowhere yet be found, And deeper awe began their hearts to fill:â âHath God removed him beyond this world's bound?â Was he too pure and good to tread our mortal ground? XXIII âIs he withdrawn to some less sinful sphere,â There to be train'd and nurtured for the strife Which he with Satan must encounter here, So to redeem our race from death to life?â Thus wildly ask'd the husband and the wife, While hope within their hearts was fading fast, And dark imaginations there were rife, And faith half sank beneath the bitter blast Which o'er their sky of peace such clouds of darkness cast. XXIV Yet fail'd not, in that dark and trying hour, Their gentle patience or confiding love; And e'en 'midst pangs which did their souls devour, Their thoughts rose freely to God's throne above. So, ere their weary steps had ceased to rove Thro' the wide city, they would spread their grief Before His altar, thus perchance to move His pity, and by prayer devout, though brief, From this exceeding woe obtain divine relief. XXV So toward the Temple, up the sacred brow Of Zion, pass'd they on their weary way, And stay'd their steps beside the portal now Through which men pass to sacrifice or pray: Throng'd was the gate with busy feet that day, For thither, at the feast, did crowds resort To hear the rabbis, who, in learn'd array, Were wont to fill the Temple's outer court, Expounding Moses' law to those of simpler sort. XXVI Onward they pass'd to where a circle stood Around a knot of doctors, then intent On some deep question, learnedly pursued With reason sound and specious argument, Whereto a curious ear the hearers lent, Silent and moveless, while on every brow Sat thought perplex'd and deepest wonderment; âBut ah! what voice disturbs that silence now? Wake, Mary, from thy grief!âah, well indeed mayst thou! XXVII The centre of that circle, close begirt With grave-eyed rabbis, erudite and sage, A stripling stood, whose high and strange desert All ears, all hearts, all voices did engage; Scarce twelve years old, (so tender was his age!) Yet with profoundest questions did he ply Those reverend men, and from the scripture page Cull close and cogent arguments, whereby He foil'd the subtlest skill of all their casuistry. XXVIII Never, till then, had disputant so keen Opposed and baffled those divines profound; Full sorely were their wits perplex'd, I ween, Against such wisdom to maintain their ground As in his fervent pleadings did abound; Yet was there nought of youth's presumption rude, Or flippant scorn in his demeanour found; Modest he was, and meek of eye and mood, With more than mortal grace and gentleness endued. XXIX In simplest phrase, and yet like one who bore Commission from on high, did he refute Those grave professors of rabbinic loreâ Doctor, and scribe, and learned priest to boot; âNot one was found who could with Him dispute; The Pharisaic bigot stood aghast,â The flippant Sadducee for once was mute, Seeing and feeling all his triumphs past, And almost deeming now Messias come at last. XXX And, on some faces, rising scorn and hate, On others fervent interest you might read; While many a listener to the keen debate Did on that stripling's words, like manna, feed, Feeling them full of grace and truth indeed; So well he reason'd upon things divine, So warm'd with life the letter of their creed, Bringing rich gems from truth's exhaustless mine, Whose brightness on all hearts, with quenchless light, did shine. XXXI His voice once heard, those wanderers forward rush'dâ âThe listening crowd divided as they came, And, for a space, the strife of words was hush'dâ Ah! can it be?âit is,âit is the same!â Their own dear son!âhis mother shriek'd his name, As sudden joy took place of grief and fear; Ah me!âmy child, whom yet I dare not blame,â Why deal'st thou with us thus?âwhat dost thou here, While we, with sorrowing hearts, have sought thee far and near? XXXII To whom our Lord, with look serene and mild,â âWherefore thus seek me?âknow ye not that I, E'en like a duteous and obedient child, Must do my Father's business?â From his eye A smile broke forth like sunshine from the sky, And his whole face with love celestial glow'd, âThen straightway turn'd he, and submissively Follow'd his joyful parents on their road, And home with them return'd, and shared their mean abode. XXXIII There, in a poor man's cot, the Lord of Heaven In meekness and in love vouchsafed to dwell, To lowly tasks of rule parental given,â Nor once against it did in thought rebel, E'en when his heavenly heart began to swell With holiest aspirations;âthus he grew In wisdom and in stature, loved full well By God in Heaven,âon Earth by all the few Who of his gentle life the grace and goodness knew. SECOND SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I With patient toil and thought profound, There are, who can all depths explore, And, in didactic phrase, expound The wondrous things of sacred lore. High privilege is theirsâto hold The torch which lights our narrow way, And to unlearned hearts unfold The hidden life, the word, the way. II But woe to such! if learned pride, Or fancy, with her restless eye, Still searching, still unsatisfied, Where holiest angels fear to pryâ If bigot's hate, or zealot's ire, Corrupt the faith which God hath given To kindle in their hearts the fire That leads and lights mankind to Heaven! III And others are there, set apart Through gifts which heavenly grace confers, To heal the bruised and sunken heart, Of peace and love blest ministers. The soothing toneâthe cheering smileâ The heart with kindness brimming o'erâ The speech which doth all griefs beguileâ The looks which banish'd peace restoreâ IV The liberal handâthe patient zealâ The sympathy in darkest caresâ The pleasant ways to help and healâ The death-bed solaceâall are theirs! Through this world's haunts of shame and sin With love unwearied, let them roam, Men's hearts, by gentlest lures, to win, And lead them, to their Father, home. V Each hath his proper gift of Godâ His own peculiar taste assign'dâ His path of duty to be trodâ His debt of service to mankind. Do thou, in simple trust, thy partâ Teach, toil, give, suffer, hope and pray, And He, who sees thy secret heart, Thy work shall blessâthy pains repay. FROM THE GOSPEL. I Wondrous was thy path on Earth, 'Midst our human grief and mirth; All our good, and all our ill, Feeling, Lord, yet sinless still! II Though thy hand upholds the spheres, Thou could'st pity children's tears: Though to thee Death yields his prey, Thou could'st gaze on children's play. III At our feasts of sober glee Thou would'st oft vouchsafe to be: When thou cam'st thy friend to save, Thou could'st weep beside his grave. IV At thy bidding, social mirth And heart-gladdening cheer had birth, When thou bad'st the goblets shine With pure water turn'd to wine. V Then, in humble love's abode, Livelier pleasure gleam'd and glow'd; Then, from rustic lips devout, Songs of joyous praise brake out: VI And thy glistening eyes might see, In their blithe festivity, What our earthly feasts had been But for death and but for sin. VII Fie on unrestrain'd excess! Fie on hateful drunkenness! Fie on each unhallow'd feast Whence thy love and name have ceased! VIII For thou still dost condescend To our hearths and homes to send Blessings on the social cheer Of the hearts that love thee here. IX Thy transforming influence still Into good turns all our ill; Or, from weak and worthless things, Holy joy and comfort brings. X Sensual passion, lust obscene, Wrath and hatred fierce and keen, Thy poor presence doth transmute To the Spirit's choicest fruit. XI When the sacred nuptial rite Doth pure heart to heart unite, Thou canst make permitted love Pure as that of saints above. XII What to our gross sense doth seem Water of the fontal stream, Thou canst change, by power divine, To celestial milk and wine. XIII But for thee, sin's hateful gloom Soon would make this Earth a tomb; But where thy bright face hath shone, Grief and fear at once are gone. XIV In thy path all things look bright, Mortal darkness turns to light, And, e'en here, our mental eye Heavenly glories may descry. XV O be with us, gracious Lord, Near our bed and at our board,â By our fireside's pleasant cheer, When the winter nights are drear. XVI Through the livelong summer day, When our hearts are blithe and gay, From all taint of fleshly ill Purify our gladness still. XVII All that doth our hearts estrange, From thy serviceâcome and change Into fervent love of thee, By thy potent alchymy. XVIII So that when new Heavens and Earth At thy bidding shall have birth, Purged from all our dross of sin, We may dwell with thee therein. THIRD SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. FROM THE EPISTLE. SONNET. Vengeance is mine! saith God; I will repay; Yet would we madly arrogate His power, Worms as we are!âpoor reptiles of an hour! And so, with many a fierce, vindictive fray, Shake and o'erthrow our fragile homes of clay, And each his foe, with bitter rage, devour, When on his head rich blessings we should shower, And with our kindness melt his wrath away! Thou, if thine enemy hunger, give him food, And to his thirst refreshing streams supply; Still overcome his evil with thy good; So, if his stubborn hate refuse to die, God shall chastise his unrelenting mood By sharp affliction's penal ministry. FROM THE GOSPEL. SONNET I. âLord! if thou wilt, thy power can make me clean!â So spake the leper, and our Lord straightway Put forth his hand, and âbe thou clean,â did say; âImmediately he rose with alter'd mien, For on his body might no more be seen A vestige of the plague, which, many a day, From Man's abodes had driven him far astray, To dwell with dark despair and anguish keen. Thus by thy swift, mysterious grace, O Lord, Cleanse thou our fouler leprosies within, That so, from exile hateful and abhorr'd, We may at length our full deliverance win, And (to thy presence in thy Church restored) Bring daily gifts of love for pardon'd sin. SONNET II. With cheerful self-surrender, to rely On the sure rock of thy omnipotence;â To rest our free, undoubting confidence, On thy deep love;âto deem thee ever nigh;â To know that Hell's dark hosts retreat and fly Even at thy beck;âto feel thee our defence When most we groan beneath the whelming sense Of our own sinâour deep iniquity;â Is not this faith?âthe faith thou dost approve; Such faith as dwelt in that centurion's breast, The burden of whose grief thou didst remove, Healing his servant at his meek request?â Such faith, O Lord, as still draws down thy love On homes which dare not claim thee for a guest? SONNET III. From East and West, and North and South, shall come Unnumber'd myriads to Christ's marriage feast;â Souls, by his gospel, from their sins released, And call'd, to His and their great Father, home! From torrid Ind, from frigid Greenland someâ A motley crowd, but in whose hearts hath ceased The empire of the demon or the beast, And peace and love have built their temple dome. But weâthe children of the kingdomâwe From earliest childhood train'd to truth and right, Where, at that day, if faithless, shall we be?â Alas! excluded from our Father's sight, For foul neglect of grace so rich and free, Gnashing our teeth in darkness day and night. FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. FROM THE EPISTLE. SONNET I. The powers that be are God'sâfrom Him derive Their functions and their rights;âso we maintain, O'er whom Christ doth, as willing subjects, reign; Whence, whosoever with such powers shall strive, Striveth with God, and doth himself contrive His own damnation. Meekly wear thy chain, Servant of Christ, nor e'er, in heart or brain, At the fierce deeds of headstrong men connive. Thine 'tis, while furious anarchs rant and rage, Filling the air with turbulence and hate, To shame the license of this latter age, Still faithful found to God and to the State; And rendering still, with spirit meek and sage, Love to the good and honour to the great. SONNET II. Not in the foul and pestilential den Of plotting treason;ânot where brawlers meet In fierce assemblies, with seditious heat To rail at monarchs;ânot where evil men Slander the great and good with tongue and pen; Not where, in crowded mart and public street, Vile demagogues their ribald slang repeatâ Spirit of Christ! thy presence meets our ken. Better thou lov'st the tranquil home and hearth Of those whom such mean-spirited esteem;â The gentle and submissive of the earth, Who glide securely down life's quiet stream, Safe, in their meek and unobtrusive worth From fears which haunt the evil-doer's dream. FROM THE GOSPEL. I With sails full spread and bending mast, Like one who bounds with glee, A fisher's bark was sailing fast Across Gennesareth's sea. Freshly and keenly blew the blast From the shore of Galilee. II A precious freight it was, I trow, Which that frail galley bore; But angry waves, from stern to prow, Her deck were sweeping o'er; And loud and louder bellow'd now The tempest's gathering roar. III But still, as on the vessel swept Through waters foaming wild, One toil-worn man lay still and slept As calmly as a child, Whose eyes for sin have never wept, Whose heart is undefiled. IV Full soundly slept he,âfor in sooth A weary man was he; A wanderer since his noon of youth, By land and lake and sea, To spread the rays of light and truth, Where darkness wont to be. V Awhile that vessel's thoughtful crew Stood gazing on his rest, With awe profound and reverence due In all their looks exprest; Till fiercer yet the tempest blew From the dark and cloudy west. VI Then straight a fearful toil began The vessel's course to keep; So wildly with the wind she ran O'er the black and boiling deep; âYet still he slept (that weary man) A calm, unstartled sleep. VII But fiercer still the surges roar'd, And fiercer blew the blast; And now, in each bold heart on board, Dark fears were gathering fast, As the winds and waves their fury pour'd On shatter'd sail and mast. VIII Then came they, in their utmost need, To where that sleeper lay;â âLord, sleep'st thou still and tak'st no heedâ Betide our lives what may?â They spakeâand at their words, with speed, The sleeper rose straightway. IX âOh! ye of little faith!ââhe stood, And calmly waved his hand; At once the tempest's wrathful mood Was hush'd at his command. And the waters, in a waveless flood, Roll'd smoothly to the strand. X No cloud obscured the deep blue sky, No ripple curl'd the sea; Earth, air, and water, far and nigh, Were calm as calm could be. The vessel's track you scarce might spy, She rode so peacefully. XI The vessel's track you scarce might spy,â And yet she wins her way, With sails untorn and cordage dry, Through the smooth and smiling bay; âNow, who is this,â the shipmen cry, âWhom the sea and the wind obey?â XII Dear Lord! a lowly life was thine, While thou with Man didst dwell; Yet winds and waves obey'd thy sign, And knew their Maker well. Thy voice could tame, with a charm divine, All powers of Earth and Hell. XIII Incarnate fiends, beneath thine eye, From human dwellings fled, With a terrified and wailing cry, To the fields where swine were fed; And the sick were heal'd at the point to die, And the graves gave up their dead. XIV And is thy power less wondrous now? Or is thy love less kind Than when they made Hell's demons bow, And still'd the waves and wind? May prayer no more, and whisper'd vow, From thee such mercy find? XV Nay, still, though oft thou seem'st to sleep, Thy love directs the helm, And guides thy Church from deep to deep, O'er this world's billowy realm; And a tender watch doth o'er it keep, Lest storms should overwhelm. XVI And still do Hell's dark legions flee From the heart where thou dost reign, And the sinner is cleansed from his leprosy, And the prisoner breaks his chain, And the soul, which was dead as dead could be, Is raised to life again. FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. FROM THE EPISTLE. SONNET I. Servants of Christ! in men's misjudging eyes Ye seem of little price, and proud men scorn Your lowliness of heart; but ye are born Of God, and made partakers of a prize Unknown, undream'd of by the worldly-wise, âA crown which none but saintly brows have worn,â A robe which doth Christ's wedding guests adorn,â Laid up, till His great day, beyond the skies. This shall be yours in Heaven,âbut now, on Earth, Think it not strange if men account you vile; Nor seek their plaudits, vain and nothing worth, Nor quail at this world's frown, nor court its smile, Clouding the glories of your own new birth With such gross aims as sensual hearts defile. SONNET II. Soldiers and patriots! votaries of the vine! And brain-sick lovers! ye have each your lay, Martial or melting, wanton, grave, or gay, As best befits each several idol's shrine; The drunkard shouts wild catches o'er his wine; The lover sighs his passionate soul away In tenderest ditties; and, while trumpets bray, Fierce war-songs animate the charging line. Each mood and humour of the sensual mind Hath its appropriate music;âand can we, Chosen of Christ, and by his love design'd To join hereafter heaven's high minstrelsy, Fail, here on earth, for our great theme to find Numbers, or words, or fitting melody? SONNET III.(CONTINUED). Nay!âto the organ wed the voice of song, And let the potent master of sweet sound, Majestic Handel, till the sense be drown'd In dream-like rapture, heavenliest strains prolong! While the full chorus of the white-robed throng Doth from the dim cathedral's roof rebound! Nor yet, with censure harsh, the less profound And tuneful skill of village minstrels wrong: The heart alone makes melody to Heaven Such as it loves; and angels oft are mute, While simplest words of praise for sin forgiven, Sung to rude notes of viol, pipe, and flute, From parish choir, at Sabbath morn and even, With grateful hymns the Omnipotent salute. SONNET IV. There are, whose faith is as a thing remote From the world's common use; who, day by day, Must from their narrow rule of duty stray, For that, as worldly and misspent, they note All hours which men to this world's cares devote,â All labours and all pleasuresâwork and playâ Save what may speed the spirit on its way O'er the calm waves of prayer and praise afloat. Not such, O Lord, the lessons thou hast taughtâ Not such thy law of worship undefiled; For that pervades all action and all thoughtâ The man's grave toils, the pastimes of the child, Bids us eat, drink, work, sport, as Christians ought, Whom thy dear blood to God hath reconciled. FROM THE GOSPEL. SONNET. 'Twere pleasant to true Christians, when they meet At their dear Master's board, to know that there All hearts, with one accord, combine in prayer Deep, pure, sincere, before Heaven's mercy-seat, Aright discerning what they drink and eat. Nor some to taunt our English Church forbear, For that she guards, say they, with slender care, Her altars from approach of reckless feet. Such laxity to error is akin; Yet errorâall, like this, on mercy's side, Methinks, can scarce deserve the brand of sin; For who, without dire mischief, shall divide From the pure wheat, till it be gather'd in, The tares, their roots extending deep and wide? SIXTH SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. FROM THE EPISTLE. SONNET I. Diverse in clime and country, wealth and birth, Lowly and lofty, rich and poor are we, Brethren, in Christ, of one great familyâ Heirs to a treasure of uncounted worth In Heaven, yet oft dishonour'd here on Earth, For that men know us notâtoo blind to see That inner light's serene effulgency Which cheers the humblest Christian's home and hearth. Yet fear we not their scorn, nor shun their hate, Knowing that love, eternal and divine, Even here hath raised us to a higher state Than this world to its noblest can assign; If to be sons of God is to be great Beyond the greatness of Earth's princeliest line. SONNET II.(CONTINUED.) Yes!âwe are sons of God, though still beset By sorrow and infirmity and sin, Fightings without, and grievous fears within; And oft with bitter tears our cheeks are wet. Such are we now; nor may we guess as yet What we shall be, when (this world's stormy din Once ended) we our final rest shall win, Where souls redeem'd all earthly griefs forget: But this we know, that when He shall appear Who is our lifeâwhatever change shall be In these frail bodies we inhabit hereâ In these weak souls not yet from bondage freeâ We shall be like Himâsince, unveil'd and near, Even as He is, our Master we shall see. SONNET III.(CONTINUED.) Such is our hope, which maketh not ashamed, Our souls sustaining with that daily bread Whereon the cold dull world hath never fed; By all but saints, unseen, unknown, unnamed; Then let not such for carnal sloth be blamed In their high calling, but, till lust be dead, Their master's path of self-denial tread; To his high model let their lives be framed. So, strength from Him deriving, let them wage Unceasing war with still unvanquish'd sin, Quelling the lusts that in their members rage, Till by degrees they cleanse the world within, And, in the Book of Life's eternal page, Triumphantly their high enrolment win. FROM THE GOSPEL. I In patient faith, till Christ shall come To call his duteous servants home, Our hearts and minds we keep; Still looking for that glorious day When Heaven and Earth shall melt away And saints awake from sleep. II And stillâas years roll swiftly by, And signs fulfill'd of prophecy Declare Christ's coming nearâ O'er Heaven and Earth our spirits range. Noting if signs of coming change, And brighter days appear. III And signs there be, in this late time, Once more of hope's reviving prime, As in redemption's morn; The feverous earth doth shake again, Groaning and travailing in pain, Till some new change be born. IV And still, as empires reel and quake, Doth longing expectation wake In questions deep engross'd; Seeking the place, the day, the hour, Of Christ's approach in all his power, With heaven's abundant host. V Vain search!âyet vainer and less blest Is theirs who would our faith molest With fancies strange and new; False prophets who men's hearts deceive, For dark and slippery paths to leave The ancient and the true. VI We will not heed them, though they preach False Christs with most persuasive speech, And godless gospels frame, Well skill'd the unstable to beguile, In freedom's name, themselves the while Sworn slaves of sin and shame VII âLo! hereââthe sensual zealots cryâ âIs man's supreme felicity;â Leave dreaming and be wise; Pleasure and love's free laws obey, Nor cast Earth's solid joys away For hopes beyond the skies. VIII âMan's full-grown mind hath burst its prisonâ On superstition's night hath risen The wish'd-for dawn of truth; Nations and empires break the sleep Of centuries, and from darkness leap To life and hope and youth. IX âIndulge the fond conceits no more Which fed the heart, ere yet was o'er The childhood of our race; Unheard let priests and poets tell Fantastic tales of Heaven and Hell!â Be Earth our resting-place! X âLet reason's sober light dispel The dreams that nature loved so wellâ Whate'er young fancy drew: Her shadowy world at once destroy, Nor barter for ideal joy The tangible and true.â XI So let them prate!âwe will not heed The dogmas of their loveless creed, Nor cast our hope away; But calmly still in patience rest, Till, lightning-like, from east to west Breaks in the promised day. XII With no unheedful hearts we hear The mutterings of convulsion near, And terror soon to be; Hosts gathering for the final strife Of light and darkness, death and life, With breathless awe we see. XIII We know that fearful darkness soon Shall veil the face of sun and moon, The stars forsake their spheres:â The powers of heaven, with fear aghast, Tremble and quake, until at last Christ's sign in heaven appears. XIV Then Earth's rebellious tribes shall wail, And sinful hearts with terror fail; While saints despised so long, From east and west, and south and north, By angel trumpets summon'd forthâ Raise one triumphant song. SEPTUAGESIMA SUNDAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. Ceaseless is the race we runâ All who live beneath the sun, For some tinsel prize of earth, Hardly won and little worth, Brother striving still with brotherâ Fain within his breast to smother Rage and hate, and jealous fear;â So we toil from year to year; Some for wealth in gold and gems, Some for gorgeous diadems; Some, a rival to beguile Of capricious beauty's smile; Some to win the warrior's name; Some to share the poet's fame; Some, perchance, to guide the helm Of the toss'd and foundering realm: But amidst the toil and din, Few, I guess, there be that win; Thousands still, who faint and fall, Ere the wish'd-for coronal Round their fever'd brows they twine; âThus doth manhood waste and pine, While the sweets which life imparts To discerning minds and hearts, Unperceived around us lie, Waste their sweetness, droop and die; And our haste no pause allows With Heaven's gale to fan our brows, Of the wayside brook to drink, Or, beside the fountain's brink Stretch'd awhile, the breath inhale Of the fresh and flower-sweet gale; Or to bless our aching eyes With the beauty of the skies, And the glories which have birth In the fresh and fragrant earth; Or, reclined beneath the shade By thick-clustering branches made, To life's joyous sounds to listen, Till our eyes with pleasure glisten, And a voice within replies To those outward harmonies, With a silent song of loveâ Silent hereâbut heard above! Few there be who loiter so In this restless race below; Few who gladden soul and sense With this world's magnificence; Fewer who such freedom win From the bonds of lust and sin, That, with an untroubled ear, They the distant music hear, Which the spirits of the blest Make in their eternal rest. So it is in this strange earthâ Outward wealth makes inward dearth. Labour drains the spirit dry, Fades the cheek, and dims the eyeâ Labour and fierce strife to win Food for lust and food for sin;â So we waste our actual store, While we vainly brawl for more; Envying still, and still contending, In turmoil that knows no ending; Restless, though our cup we fill, While Earth holds a fuller still: Sad, though we an empire gain, While more potent monarchs reign. Yet was ever earthly crown Which grim death could not beat down?â Gold which we could hoard and save In the chambers of the grave?â Beauty by no change invaded, Which nor time nor sickness faded?â Is not all we love so well, Like ourselves, corruptible?â Do we not, for worthless things, Barter the delight that springs From the soul's eternal health?â Still exchanging peace for wealth,â Wearing out the life and strengthâ Only to possess at length, Through our endless toil and care, Raiment for the flesh to wear When the flesh itself is wastedâ Food, then only to be tasted When no more the exhausted sense Can discern its excellence? Brethren! meet it is that we Wiser far and happier be;â Wiser than to waste, on earth, All its bliss and all its mirth, That, for life-long pains and cost Heaven and it may both be lost. Yet have we a race to run,â Gloryâto be lost or won, Brighter than, since earth began, Cheer'd the waking sense of man, Or, in nightly visions, stole On the slumbers of his soul. Sharp that race to sensual flesh, Though the spirit may be fresh; And, until its toil hath ceased, Still our vigour is increased; Whileâas nearer still we come To our goal and to our homeâ Lovelier landscapes round us glow, Sweeter breezes breathe and blow, Brighter sunshine cheers our eyes, And the choral symphonies Of the heavenly legions ring Audibly our welcoming. Wouldst thou win yon heavenly crown?â Christian, tame thy spirit down; Loiter not in sensual bowers, Flush'd with wine and crown'd with flowers; Nor of Comus and his train Join the revels wild and vain. Let not love's delicious play Steal thy soul and sense away, Till thou canst no longer learn Wisdom's lessons pure and stern. Pleasure's cup may luscious be, But it is not mix'd for thee. If thou wouldst thy spirit train For its heavenly race, refrain From whate'er regalements bring Foul excess and surfeiting. Keep each power of heart and will Clear, and free, and vigorous still. Though thy toil be sharp and sore, Soon, full soon, it will be o'er, And thy weary brain and breast Taste of Heaven's eternal rest. FROM THE GOSPEL. I Through the world's frequented placesâ Busy street and broad high-wayâ 'Midst the throng of human faces, Year by year and day by dayâ Wisdom's earnest voice is calling To the slaves whom sloth and sin Hold, in sensual chains enthralling, âCome ye, to my vineyard, in!â II Happy, in life's cloudless morning, Yea, of all men happiest they Who receive that heavenly warning, Hear it and at once obey! They, ere lust hath dimm'd the splendour Of the opening world withinâ Ere the heart hath grown less tender,â Break the bonds of sense and sin. III Them no sore avulsion rendeth From this world's vain hopes and fears; No unheal'd remembrance blendeth Anguish with their after years. Time by them hath ne'er been wasted;â Ere life's tempting paths they trod,â Ere life's poison'd cup they tasted,â They became the sons of God. IV Them no storm of woe compelleth To their Father's arms to flee; In their hearts His Spirit dwelleth Richly e'en from infancy. Christ to love's unceasing duty Them with silken cords constrains, And with gleams of heavenly beauty Soothes their sorrows, charms their pains. V Happy they! but few in number!â Till mid age the millions lie Wrapt in dreams of sensual slumber, While life's brightest hours go by. Them, amidst their cares or pleasures, Wisdom's voice again invites; âComeâsecure your heavenly treasures, Flee from Earth's impure delights!â VI Some there be who heed and hearken, Cast their worthless gauds away, Ere life's noon begins to darken, Shade by shade, to twilight grey. Wealth to them becomes a bubble, Honour but an empty name; âFarewell now life's toil and trouble, Fraud and folly, sin and shame! VII Nobler hopes have stirr'd within them, Loftier aims engage the breast; Heaven and heavenly labours win them From this feverish world's unrest. They the better part have chosen, Late, but not too late to toil; Years not yet the heart have frozen, Though rank weeds o'erspread its soil. VIII Noon hath past;âlife's fervour waneth; O'er the temperate heart and will Sensual lust less blindly reigneth, Yet the spirit slumbereth still. Wisdom's voice again upbraidethâ âHasteâlife's sun will soon go down; Ere its light for ever fadeth, Wake and win your heavenly crown.â IX Fainter now that voice appeareth, Yet it will not cease to plead, Till the awaken'd sleeper heareth, Till his heart is touch'd indeed. From life's evening rest he starteth, Eager some few hours to save (Ere the time for work departeth) From the darkness of the grave. X Eve is gone;âgrey twilight's glimmer Veileth life's cold cloudy sky;â Soul and sense are now grown dimmer,â Fadeth ear and heart and eye. In the wreck of thought and feeling Earthly love is waxing cold; Yet are Wisdom's accents stealing To the soul in sin grown old. XI Lo!âthe hoary sinner turneth Feebly to the awakening sound; In his heart strange fervour burneth, Love hath sin's strong chain unwound. Little hath he now to proffer,â Time and strength and health are gone;â What remains behold him offerâ âLord! in me thy will be done!â XII Yea! even so:âthy ways, O Father! Are not as our mortal ways; Thou canst life's whole harvest gather From its worst and weakest days. To thy just decision bending, At thy feet our works we cast; Though, in bliss all thought transcending, Last be first, and first be last! SONNET. FROM THE SAME. Our lot hath fallen upon the latter timeâ The cloudless evening of the Church's day; Whose burden and fierce heat have past away, That scarce we need that faith and zeal sublime, Which, in her pure and persecuted prime, Taught tender maids and matrons old and grey, Smiling defiance in death's grim array, To the proud heights of martyrdom to climb. Beneath our fig-trees and our vines we dwell At ease.âWhat claim then to their bliss have we Who with the fiercest powers of Earth and Hell Warr'd, and so won their immortality? Ask not:âbut wage thine own poor warfare wellâ E'en as thy striving thy reward shall be. SEXAGESIMA SUNDAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. SONNET. Thou wouldst have been, had all thy hopes died here, Of mortal men most wretched, Holy Paul! For thou didst cast away thine earthly allâ Wealth, comfort, reputation bright and clear, Yea, whatsoever carnal men hold dear, To be what, in their blindness, they miscall A low fanatic,âsuperstition's thrall, Then most contemptible when most sincere. The Gentle sophist mock'd thy simple creed, The bigot Jew pursued thee with fierce hate; E'en faithless brethren, in thine utmost need, Forsook thee;âthou, meanwhile, didst calmly wait God's time, content on Earth to toil and bleed, Till martyrdom should ope Heaven's narrow gate. FROM THE GOSPEL. I God! who dost the increase grant To thy labourers here below, When they water, when they plant, When the Heavenly seed they sow; Bless, O Father, bless our toil, With the sunshine of thy face;â Fertilize this barren soil With the dews of love and grace. II Thine the harvest, thine the praise, When the crops are gather'd in, Which, with life-long pains we raise In this world of shame and sin. Where we sow 'tis thine to reapâ All our days are seed-time here;â Ceaselessly at work we keep, Month by month and year by year. III Spring and autumn toil we stillâ Through the long midsummer light; Through the winter, dark and chill, Scattering seed from morn till night. Now, with zeal's persuasive power, Life-infusing truth we preach; Now, for many a patient hour, In the village schoolroom teach. IV Oft beside the social hearth Stealthily the seed we sow,â Oft when hearts are light with mirthâ Oftener when oppress'd with woe. Times and seasons watch we stillâ Still the best occasions seek, When to bend the stubborn will, When the awakening word to speak. V So we toil, but toil in vain When the dews of grace are dry; When the fertilizing rain Lingers in the drouthy sky. Now in rocky soils we sowâ Hearts from Heaven so far astray, That, or ere the blade can grow, Satan steals the seed away. VI Some in light and shallow mould Doth, with fairer promise, fall,â Ardent minds and uncontroll'dâ Sensitiveâbut weak withal. Such, anon, with joy embrace, Hear and ponder, weep and pray, Tillâwhen trouble shews its faceâ Straight their flimsy faith gives way. VII Other seed in deeper soil Sinks, and takes abiding root; But rank thorns the produce spoil, Choke and mar the genuine fruit. Worldly care and lust and pride, Wealth and luxury creep in, Till the life of life hath died, Stifled by insidious sin. VIII Thou, the harvest's sovereign Lord! For the seed the soil prepare, Sun and rain and dews afford, Till the wish'd-for crop it bear. Good and honest hearts create, Swift to hear and firm to hold; Make our tillage, soon or late, Bring forth fruit an hundred-fold. QUINQUAGESIMA SUNDAY. FROM THE GOSPEL. I 'Twas when our Lord was journeying tow'rd stately Jericho, And multitudes around his path did gather still and grow For wondrous were the words he spakeâpure words of truth and grace, And all the love of Earth and Heaven was beaming from his face; And miracles of healing might his blessed hand had done, Proclaiming Him, to faithful eyes, the Lord's anointed Son. II Now as he to the city gate, in earnest speech, drew nigh, A blind man sat beside the road, and begg'd of passers by; He heard the hum of multitudesâthe myriad-footed treadâ And in his darkness, anxiously, âWhat meaneth this?â he said;â âWhat mean these sounds of thronging crowds?ââand thus men made replyâ âJesus, the blessed Nazareneâ'tis He who passeth by.â III Then suddenly a gleam of light shot through the beggar's mind, His inward eye was lighten'd, and his heart no longer blind; Faith brought him back the world without, in blissful vision shown, And said it might, by Heaven's rich grace, become once more his own. So straight he raised his eager voice, and piteously cried heâ âJesus! thou Son of David! have mercy upon me!â IV His cry disturb'd the listening groups, the foremost in the wayâ âNow hold thy peace, bold beggarâtrouble not our Lord,â said they. But little heeded he their words, for in his mental eye Familiar facesâyouthful scenes, long lost, were passing by; And still he raised his earnest voice, and piteously cried heâ âJesus! thou Son of David! have mercy upon me!â V Our Lord stood still, and fix'd on him a mild, approving glance, Till the blind man felt the sunshine of his beaming countenance;â âForbid him not, but rather guide his steps to me,â he said,â And the beggar to his presence straight by pitying hands was led; And as he knelt before Him, with raised hands and bended kneeâ âTell me,â he said, âwhat wilt thou that I should do for thee?â VI That voice of heavenly mercy through the blind man's bosom thrill'd As sweetly as the dew of Heaven on Hermon's brow distill'd. He felt the pressure of the grief that on his spirit lay, But felt that soon, at His dear word, that grief would pass away; Nor paused he for a moment's space, but cried, in deep delight, âLord! this I wouldâthat, from thy hand, I might receive my sight!â VII âReceive thy sight,â our Lord replied,ââthy faith hath made thee wholeââ And the blind man rose, with sight restored to body and to soul; And blithely in his Saviour's track, with eager steps, he trod, And bless'd him for his healing grace, and glorified his God.â And all the crowds, that throng'd around, with echoing hearts repliedâ âOur God, and Jesus Christ, his Son, for this be glorified!â ASH WEDNESDAY. FROM THE EPISTLE. I When our hearts with grief are sore, When our path looks dark and sad, When Hope's star appears no more, When our foes are proud and gladâ When our steps have gone astray, Till we feel the chastening rod, Wherefore should the godless sayâ âWhere is now their God?â II In our grief of heart is Heâ In the darkness of our pathâ Him in Hope's eclipse we see, Robed in mercy, not in wrath. Thus he warns us from the wayâ Sin's wild way, which we have trod;â Why should then the godless sayâ âWhere is now their God?â III While in this dark world we roam, Out of sight His judgments lie; Stay till we have reach'd our homeâ That bright home beyond the sky. When, in Time's last awful day, We of Earth throw off the sodâ How shall then the godless sayâ âWhere is now their God?â HYMN FOR EASTER EVE. I All is o'er;âthe pain, the sorrow,â Human taunts, and fiendish spite; Death shall be despoil'd to-morrow Of the prey he grasps to-night; Yet once more, to seal his doom, Christ must sleep within the tomb. II Close and still the cell that holds him, While in brief repose he lies; Deep the slumber that enfolds him Veil'd awhile from mortal eyes:â Slumber such as needs must be After hard-won victory. III Fierce and deadly was the anguish Which on yonder cross he bore; How did soul and body languish, Till the toil of death was o'er! But that toil, so fierce and dread, Bruised and crush'd the serpent's head. IV Whither hath his soul departed?â Roams it on some blissful shore, Where the meek and faithful-hearted, Vext by this world's hate no more, Wait, until the trump of doom Call their bodies from the tomb? V Or, on some benignant mission, To the imprison'd spirits sent, Hath he to their dark condition Gleams of hope and mercy lent?â Souls not wholly lost of old, When o'er earth the deluge roll'd! I Peter, iii. 19, 20. VI Ask no more;âthe abyss is deeper E'en than angels' thoughts may scan; Come and watch the heavenly sleeper; Come and do what mortals can, Reverence meet toward Him to prove, Faith, and trust, and humble love. VII Far away, amidst the regions Of the bright and balmy east, Guarded by angelic legions Till Death's slumber shall have ceased, (How should we its stillness stir?) Lies the Saviour's sepulchre. VIII Far away;âyet thought would wander (Thought by Faith's sure guidance led), Farther yet to weep and ponder Over that sepulchral bed. Thither let us haste and flee On the wings of phantasy. IX Haste, from every clime and nation, Fervent youth, and reverend age; Peasant, prince,âeach rank and station, Haste, and join this pilgrimage. East and west, and south and north, Send your saintliest spirits forth. X Mothers, ere the curtain closes Round your children's sleep to-night, Tell them how their Lord reposes, Waiting for to-morrow's light; Teach their dreams to Him to rove, Him who loved them, Him they love. XI Matron grave and blooming maiden, Hoary sage and beardless boy, Hearts with grief and care o'erladen, Hearts brimful of hope and joy, Come and greet, in death's dark hall, Him who felt with, felt for all. XII Men of God, devoutly toiling This world's fetters to unbind; Satan of his prey despoiling In the hearts of human kind; Let to-night your labours cease, Give your care-worn spirits peace. XIII Ye who roam o'er seas and mountains, Messengers of love and light; Ye who guard Truth's sacred fountains Weary day and wakeful night; Men of labour, men of lore, Give your toils and studies o'er. XIV Dwellers in the woods and valleys, Ye of meek and lowly breast; Ye who, pent in crowded alleys, Labour early, late take rest; Leave the plough, and leave the loom, Meet us at our Saviour's tomb. XV From your halls of stately beauty, Sculptured roof and marble floor, In this work of Christian duty Haste, ye rich, and join the poor, Mean and noble, bond and free, Meet in frank equality. XVI Lo, His grave! the grey rock closes O'er that virgin burial-ground; Near it breathe the garden roses, Trees funereal droop around; In whose boughs the small birds rest, And the stock-dove builds her nest. XVII And the moon with floods of splendour Fills the spicy midnight air; Tranquil sounds and voices tender Speak of life and gladness there, Ne'er was living thing, I wot, Which our Lord regarded not. XVIII Bird, and beast, and insect rover,â E'en the lilies of the field, Till His gentle life was over, Heavenly thought to Him could yield: All that is to Him did prove Food for wisdom, food for love. XIX But the hearts that bow'd before Him Most of all to Him were dear; Let such hearts to-night watch o'er Him, Till the day-spring shall appear; Then a brighter sun shall rise Than e'er kindled up the skies. XX All night long, with plaintive voicing, Chaunt his requiem, soft and low; Loftier strains of loud rejoicing From to-morrow's harps shall flow. âDeath and hell at length are slain, Christ hath triumph'd, Christ doth reign.â April 2nd, 1836. PROTESTANT HYMN TO THE VIRGIN. I With no forbidden vow To thy blest name we bow, Holiest of women, nor, with suppliant knee, And fondly whisper'd prayer, The votive gift prepare, Which yet, with reverent heart, we bring to Thee, As to the highly favour'd, from whose womb Into this groaning world did its Redeemer come. II Not as enthroned on high Near Heaven's dread Majesty; Not as endued with Mediatorial power, With Christ to intercede For human hearts that bleed When sin assails, or care and grief devour; Not as the Queen of Heaven, by right divine, Do we bemock thy praise, or idolize thy shrine. III We know not on what shore, Since life's brief toil was o'er, Thy soul hath sojourn'd; whether dreamless sleep, Diffused o'er brain and breast, Lulls sense and thought to rest, While angels their calm watch beside thee keep, Till their great Captain's trump shall rend the tomb, Proclaiming the dread day of Nature's final doom. IV Or whether, near the side Of Him, the Crucified, Thy Saviour and thy Son, already tasting Rich antepasts of Heaven, (Thy mortal sins forgiven For his dear sake) thou calmly view'st the wasting Of Time's dull ages, which must fade and flee, Ere body, soul, and sense, in perfect bliss can be; V Or whether, from on high, Thou lead'st the company Of spirits sent to minister below To all salvation's heirs, Soothing their human cares, And o'er their darkest hours of earthly woe Breathing the balm of Heaven's eternal peace, And smoothing danger's waves, and causing fear to cease. VI Such hosts as once of old Did mortal eye behold, Unseen till then, nor ever since display'd; When, in the illumined mount, In numbers passing count, Chariot on chariot, horse with horse array'd In fiery legions, with empyreal blaze, At the great Prophet's prayer burst on his servant's gaze. VII Such forms as oft seem nigh To Christian dreamer's eye, At lonely twilight, or the tearful hour When friends, long parted, meet In converse sad but sweet, Of friends fast bound in Death's still grasping power; The loved, the long'd for, who, from their repose, Look down, they fondly deem, on all their joys and woes. VIII No thought of man can guess In what obscure recess Of Heaven or Earth those blessed souls may be Who, purged from fleshly stain, Are from the galling chain Of fleshly bondage, by the grave, set free; We know not of their haunts, but know that thou Art e'en as one of them, and with them mingled now. IX Of all that saintly host With whom consort'st thou most? To whom (if disembodied spirits frame Intelligible speech, Imparting, each to each, Thought for which we, the earthly, have no name)â To whom, O Holiest, dost thou now disclose The pure and peaceful thoughts which gladden thy repose? X Haply they all to thee Yield meet precedency,â To thee, the saintliest of all saints confest; Encircling some bright throne Whereon thou reign'st alone, The virgin queen of all the realm of rest; Dispensing smiles, like light, from side to side, On ranks of radiant saints, and martyrs glorified. XI Yet one, perchance, there is, Joint heiress of thy bliss, And scarce less honour'd; before whom e'en thou, With reverence due, lay'st down Thine amaranthine crown, And veil'st the blaze of thy effulgent brow; She, our great Mother, Mary, ours and thine, And saved, like us and thee, by love and grace divine. XII On her majestic face The blest still haply trace The lingering look of scarce forgotten sadness; E'en while, in rapture mild, On thee her favourite child She gazeth through bright smiles and tears of gladness, For earth's four thousand years of grief and gloom Ended by Him who lay within thy Virgin womb. XIII Two forms are at her side, Serene and thoughtful-eyed; Abel and Enoch;âDeath's first victim this; For whom that bitterest pain First pierced the heart and brain Of Parents mourning for Earth's dearest bliss; The other, deathless raised from Earth to Heaven, Type of the grave subdued, and sin, through faith, forgiven. XIV And, haply, some there be, Erewhile endued, like thee, With woman's holiest heart; who trod on earth The ways of Heavenly truth,â Meek Hannah, constant Ruth, And that fair Persian Queen of Hebrew birth: Some, haply, who with thee on Earth were seen, Martha, and Mary, and repentant Magdalene. XV And others whom even we (If fondest Phantasy May image that which Love would fain believe) Have walk'd with here below,â Now freed from all Earth's woeâ Souls whom thou may'st, with tenderest love, receive; Mothers, and wives, and maidens undefiled, And infants who, even here, might on thy lap have smiled. XVI But wherefore thus prolong, In vain, presumptuous song, Poor shadowy fancies of a world unseen! Why strive to picture thee, As what thou now may'st beâ Rather than that which thou indeed hast been; A mortal dweller in this world of death, A thing of flesh and blood, instinct with human breath? XVII As such, men yielded thee Their fond idolatry, (For which thou weep'st, if souls in glory can;) For thee impassion'd thought Such fleshly beauty wrought, As thrills the enamour'd soul of sensual man. So the meek mother, with her babe divine, Was hymn'd with many a vow at many an erring shrine. XVIII Nor e'er with subtler wile The old Tempter did beguile His victim Man from worship pure and true; Assembling whatsoe'er Of holy, bright and fair Creation yieldeth to our human view; When to thy name he bade us bend the knee, Fall down before thy shrine, and fondly worship Thee. XIX For in thy heart did meet Such feelings pure and sweet As never met in woman save in thee; The maid's, the mother's heart, Complete in every part, Woman's meek faith, and angel's purity; So Heaven and Earth in thee commingled seem;â Whate'er on Earth we love,âwhate'er of Heaven we dream. XX No wanton fancies wild Thy maiden prime beguiled; Nor hopes, nor fears of Earth's tumultuous love; But Faith to visions high Unseal'd thy mental eye, And fix'd thy earnest heart on things above. Meet wast thou, and most worthy to behold That glorious angel's face, who thy great doom foretold. XXI Nor at thy nuptial hour, Nor in thy bridal bower, Might earthly passion and light dalliance be; But o'er thy saintly soul An awful rapture stole, When Heaven's creative power o'ershadow'd thee, Impregnating thy chaste and virgin womb With Him who died to rise triumphant o'er the tomb. XXII And when that hour was come, Consign'd, by Eve's dread doom, To bitterest anguish, with no mortal throes Of travail dire, but free From nature's agony, Didst thou the treasure of thy womb disclose; And, at the fountains of thy virgin breast, First feed Heaven's newborn heir, then cradle him to rest. XXIII Nor did thy bosom know A mother's anxious woe; Her painful pressure of continual care; Her wakeful hopes and fears; Her secret sighs and tears; When o'er her child, of sin and death the heir, She watcheth with a heart of wild unrest, Lest sickness seize his frame, or sin corrupt his breast. XXIV For he, the immortal, grew, With tender heart and true, In wisdom, as in stature, at thy feet; His bosom free within From speck or taint of sin; Each act in outward rectitude complete; And in thy lowly home, with reverence mild, Did all thy gentle will, a grave and godly child. XXV Communion calm and pure Was that which did endure Through childhood's years between his soul and thine; O'er many a treasured word From his dear accents heard, And breathing wisdom high and love divine, Brooded thy heart until the hour was come, When He for God's great work must leave his tranquil home. XXVI Never on earth, till then, In all the haunts of men, Did such a mother watch o'er such a child; 'Twas thine alone to see, From tenderest infancy To perfect manhood, nature undefiled By act or thought of sin, each day revealing New depths of guileless love, and pure and heavenly feeling. XXVII Say, swell'd thy heart with pride, When thou beheld'st him ride In meekest glory, in the after years; While, strewn o'er all his way, Branches and garments lay, And loud Hosannahs, pealing in his ears, Hail'd him the promised king from David's stem, Coming in triumph to his own Jerusalem? XXVIII And when the traitor's art Had done its hateful part, And speechless he, and uncomplaining stood; By cruel scourges torn, While many a piercing thorn Bedew'd his godlike brow with streams of blood; And the coarse rabble, with insulting cry, Taunted his patient grief, and mock'd his agony;â XXIX When on the cross he hung With parch'd and feverish tongue, By torture dire and dreadful anguish spent; Till Earth's convulsive groan Proclaim'd his spirit flown, While the hills trembled, and the rocks were rent, And heaven itself lay wrapt in distant gloom, And many a buried saint rose from his bursting tomb;â XXX What feeling then was thine? Did thy pure heart repine At thy child's anguish? or, in him beholding All sorrow slain at last, And Death's dread empire past, Couldst thou rejoice, e'en while, (thy arms enfolding His gentle corpse in their most pure embrace,) Thou gazed'st thro' thy tears on that pale, lifeless face? XXXI And when, (his conflicts o'er,) From Hades' shadowy shore Return'd, he rose triumphant o'er the tomb; Oh! shared he not with thee, In tenderest sympathy, His joy and triumph for man's alter'd doom? Wast thou alone, of all he loved, forgot, The only friend on earth whom he remember'd not? XXXII Where wast thou in that hour When he, by Death's dark power Enthrall'd erewhile in his sepulchral prison, Once more on earth was seen By faithful Magdalene? Why heardst not thou the greeting, âHe hath risen! Come, see the place in which the Saviour lay; The seal is broken now, the stone is roll'd away?â XXXIII For many a day appear'd That form and face revered Where brethren met, and many a word was spoken By that divinest voice, Which made their hearts rejoice In pain and peril; yet he left no token, By man recorded, of especial love, No word or thought of thee ere yet he went above. XXXIV We know not, nor may gess Why slept his tenderness (Or seem'd to sleep) once deeply felt tow'rd thee; Or if indeed he came, In heart and soul the same E'en as in childhood he was wont to be, To lay his deathless trophies at thy feet, And all his pangs to thee and all his joys repeat. XXXV Such things may well have beenâ Too sacred to be seen By human eye, or told by human pen; Yea; till thy aged breast Sank to its final rest, And thy form faded from the eyes of men, Such parting words may in its depths have dwelt As gave thee peace and joy which none but thou have felt. XXXVI But vain all efforts be Of venturous phantasy To such dim heights of shadowy thought to climb: Almost unmeet it seems To suffer her wild dreams Round thee to float, and in fantastic rhyme, Depict thee, to the mind's believing eye, In false and fading tints of airy imagery. XXXVII We deem thee bright and fair, Almost as angels are; And haply such thou wast; but few endure To picture thee grown old 'Midst sorrows manifold, Widow'd and childless, feeble, frail and poor; With wrinkled brow, and locks of hoary gray, And eye grown dim and dull by years of slow decay. XXXVIII Nor love our hearts the gloom Diffused around the tomb Which hides thy form, to hungry worms a prey; Nor bear, in thought, to trace Corruption's foul embrace Wasting thy sweet mortality away. Thou art too fair, too heavenly-bright a thing To bear the loathly breath of such imagining. XXXIX But thee, with features mild, On thy celestial child Down-looking, in bright youth's resplendent bloom, We cherish with fond heart; As many a limner's art Shadows thee forth, unsullied by the gloom Of years or mortal pain; thy gentle eyes Beaming forth Heaven's own love, like gleams from Paradise. XI And yet, methinks, 'twere well Our foolish hearts should dwell On thy fair image e'en in its decay; Remembering that of old, Beneath the wormy mould, As we must lie, the Saviour's mother lay; Like us the grave, like us corruption saw, Subject, like us and ours, to Death's unbending law. XLI 'Twas thine on earth to share Whatever griefs we bear, Christ's parent, yet our sister; and to thee Our reverent hearts look back O'er Time's mysterious track, As to the first by Heaven ordain'd to be A Christian matronâthat most holy thing Which human thought can frame in all its wandering. XLII And Woman, who began Then first to rank with Man, His subject, but thenceforth no more his slave; Derives, in part, from thee Her righteous victory O'er injury and wrong; and o'er thy grave In thought laments, meet reverence to express To thee, in Christian rights, her first great ancestress. XLIII Such honours still be thine; Such wreaths for ever twine Around thy sepulchre as now we bring; Such greetings thither come From many a Christian home, Where wife, and husband, and glad children sing, At morn and eve, their hymn of peace and love, For comfort here below, to him who reigns above. XLIV Let Christian maids from thee, Type of virginity, Borrow their blameless thoughts, their calm desires; And Christian matrons seek Thy spirit mild and meek; Thy holy wisdom; sons and reverend sires, By love like thine in Christian nurture rear'd, Still bless the mother's looks, the mother's tones revered. XLV But hark! the trump of doom Peals through, and bursts the tomb! The living and the dead together throng Before the eternal throne, Whereon He sits alone, Who died upon the cross for human wrong. Mary, the child to whom thy womb gave birth, Unveil'd in glory stands; sole judge of heaven and earth. XLVI And thee, and us, and all, That dreadful trump must call, To hear our several dooms by Him decreed: In terror of that day Vain fancy melts away; E'en Christian faith doth tremble like a reed Sway'd by the wind:âwe think of Thee no more; Our song is silent now; its music past and o'er. SUNDAY IN THE MOUNTAINS. CANTO I. I 'Tis Sunday morn!âa summer Sunday morn!â And should be full of sunshine, for July, Queen of the circling months, to-day is born; Yet o'er yon mountain peaks, which pierce the sky, Dark louring clouds in densest masses lie, Which though, all night, the rain in torrents pour'd, Seem yet unspent, and to the inquiring eye A dark presage of coming storms affordâ Signs to wayfaring wight most hateful and abhorr'd! II But not, though skies should lour or tempests rage, To-day must Brodick's sturdy mountaineer Grudge through the grimmest moors stout pilgrimage; For 'tis that single Sunday in the year, When crowds together flock, from far and near, Around the holy board to take their seat; And 'twere a shameless thing to loiter here, While friends and brethren, flocks and pastors meet In Kirk of far Lamlash, to bless that bread and eat. III Unhappy he whom sickness now detains Close pent in bed, or crouching o'er his fire, Safe from the gathering war of winds and rains; And he whose aged limbs no more aspire To thrid the mountain moors and never tire; And she, whom nursery or domestic cares Forbid to satisfy her heart's desire, By mingling, with the Kirk's, her vows and prayers.â Ah!âwell-a-day for them!âa dismal lot is theirs! IV No more for them, till full twelve months are o'er, With heavenly food that table shall be spread; For them the cup divine be fill'd no more, Nor blest, nor broken the mysterious bread, E'en though they lay upon their dying bed. So Calvinistic rigour hath decreed; Withholding that by which the soul is fed From saintly sufferers in their utmost need;â Ah! better far her sons doth our dear Mother feed! V Solemn and sweet thy monthly feasts, I ween, Church of our fathers; yet even they too few; Better, by far, and wiser had it been, Thy children's faith each Sunday to renew, And with fresh strength their fainting souls endue; So best the ancient Apostolic rites Maintaining still in form and order due; Yet dear thy call which to that board invites, Which all pure hearts with all, and all in One, unites! VI Yea, sweet thy monthly feasts!âyet scarce than these Less sweet the board in sick man's chamber spread, Where weeping friends and children on their knees Are meekly gather'd round the dying bed; And tears, almost into the chalice shed, The o'er-burden'd hearts full agony relieve, While each and all the mystic wine and bread From pastoral hands, in pious faith, receive, Nor now, like hopeless men, for death's new victim grieve. VII No comforts, such as these, O Scotland, cheer Thy saints in life's last moments;âyet not this Speak we in scorn;âthe dying mountaineer By custom school'd, and strong in hope of bliss, May ne'er, perchance, the last dear ritual miss, Whereby the expiring Southron well sustains His parting soul;ânor thou account amiss The rites which soften death in English plains, As though they proved us bound even now in Popish chains. VIII Such thoughts yon stout pedestrian's breast have cross'd, Who climbs, with steady pace and steadfast will, That mountain path, and tow'rd the peaks, half lost In eddying clouds, looks back, admiring still; For vaster far seems each majestic hill Through the dense veil of mist which sweeps away Distinctness from its outline, and each rill, Swoln to a foaming cataract to-day, Makes music, loud and wild, to cheer him on his way. IX A wanderer he from England's midland vales, Wooing sweet health in this fair wilderness, Where, shunning the soft breath of southern gales, Which him with suffocation sore oppress, He finds secure relief from long distress; And now a glad and mirthful man is he, And doth the waves and breezy mountains bless That they from that dire plague have set him free, 'Neath which, since early youth, he groan'd perpetually. X O thou unhappy wight, whoe'er thou art, Whom the bright skies and balmy gales torment With toil of lungs and weariness of heart, Till thou, almost with lack of breath o'erspent To barter life for ease wouldst be contentâ Throw physic to the dogs;ânot opium's power, Nor the inhaled stramonium's reeky scent, Nor subtlest ether will, for one brief hour, Soothe the convulsive gasps which strength and life devour. XI Nor to the lancet bare thy passive arm, Nor to the blister ope thy labouring breast; Vain all their spells the dire disease to charm, Or scare the incumbent vampyre from thy chest; Nor yet will pill, persuasive to digest, Nor snuff prepared by skill of Lundy Foot, Nor ipecacuanha give thee rest, (Expectorative drug)ânor rhubarb's root Provoking nausea dire, and cholic pangs to boot. XII Long were the labour, in melodious verse, The nostrums strange prescribed by quack and crone, (Nauseous alike, and poisonous) to rehearse! Abominable thingsâuntriedâunknown! One remedy there is, and one alone;â Come, breathe the mountain breezes pure and free, Climb once a week old Goatfell's craggy cone, Bathe once a day in Brodick's crystal sea,â Full soon, from spells like these, the baffled fiend will flee. XIII Haply some grim Hippocrates hath starved Thy craving stomach with prescription drear, All pleasant meats forbidding to be carved For thee, nor e'en permitting thee to cheer Thy drooping spirits with the smallest beerâ (Thee, little to abstemious rules inclined;) Come thenâspare diet may be spared thee here, Nor need'st thou dread on dainties to have dined, If dainties thou shalt chance in this lean isle to find. XIV But where is he, our lone wayfaring wight, Whom late we left upon the mountain side? Through the wild moors he plods from height to height, Surveying still the landscape far and wide; Though little there, to-day, can be descried, So thick and dark the clouds around him lour; Yet will he dare, all cloakless, to abide The utmost rage of driving wind and shower, So strong and proud he feels in health's recover'd power. XV And sorely would his soul be grieved, I ween, To miss that solemn spectacle to-day; To him a new, though not unheard of scene; Used as he is in English forms to pray, And England's rule episcopal obey;â A presbyter himself, as from the dress Clerkly and grave, which doth his limbs array, And eke from his demeanour you may guess, Albeit, in this strict land, convict of carelessness. XVI For he, untaught in puritanic school, And little heedful of the forms that bind The subjects grave of presbyterian rule, Walks, as his fancy leads him, unconfined By pedant laws in body as in mind; Nor deems it unbecoming pastoral state His pleasure by the lone sea-side to find, Or e'en with timely mirth to recreate His spirits, sunk sometimes by care's oppressive weight. XVII Ah! reckless man, and all unfit to bear The scrutiny of keen domestic eyes! Now whistling, as he walks, with absent air, Now singing (if perchance an infant cries) Wild nursery rhymes and heathenish lullabies; Unconscious all the while what scandal thence Among the simple mountaineers shall rise;â Scandal most foul, and unforeseen offence, Branding his Church and him with righteous vehemence! XVIII But worst of allâprovoking direst wrathâ His Southron scorn of Scottish Sabbath-day! For, kirk-ward as he climbs the mountain path; He, with his cane, full oft doth prostrate lay The thistle-heads that grow beside the way; And eke, descending once the gallery stair, Was heard (as all the congregation say) To hum aloud a Psalm's remeber'd air;â Such crime, in Scottish kirk, could shameless Southron dare! XIX But now, midway on yonder steep ascent Halting awhile, he views with curious eyes Groups from each quarter of the firmament Converging, numberless as summer fliesâ In cart, in car, of every shape and size, Afootâon horseback;âgrandames old and grey, In sober mutch and cloak of tartan dyes, By sons or grandsons in their best array, In vehicles close-pack'd, help'd forward on their way. XX And there are sturdy swains on bony jades, In low grave converse journeying side by side; And there are comely youths and comelier maids, The future bridegroom with his plighted bride; Bare-headed she and bare-footâthe close plaid Pronounced, in Scotland, plide. Shielding her gentle bosom from the rain; Her braided locks confined, in decent pride, With virgin snood, which must unloosed remain Till she, in wedlock's bonds, a holier name shall gain. XXI Graceful her garb, and passing well doth suit Her native mountains; yet, to Southron eye, Unpleasing is the soil'd and shoeless foot, Which through the mire its daily toil doth ply, Heedless alike if it be wet or dryâ And haply swathed in rag's unseemly fold, Telling dark tales that underneath doth lie Afflictive corn, or blain produced by coldâ Most hateful to conceiveâmost hideous to behold! XXII Dear to the youthful poet's phantasy Is female foot, in dream or vision seen; The well-turn'd ankle's shapely symmetryâ The skin's soft texture and its snowy sheen; But adverse all to phantasy, I ween, The sun-burnt limb by highland lassie shownâ Not plump, soft, white, but muscular and lean, A ponderous mass of sinew, skin, and boneâ Broadâbulkyâto rude shape, thro' long exposure, grown. XXIII O maidens, richly with all else endow'd, Healthy in mind and body, pure and free As the clear stream, or as the wandering cloud, Which swathes the mountains where ye love to be,â Hide but in shoes, what few unshod would see, And ye by many a poet shall be sung In worthier lays than e'er were penn'd by me, A wedded bard, and now no longer young, Who roam, with heart unscathed, your pastoral glens among. XXIV Strange, of a truth, that o'er these rocky ways Women alone with naked feet should fare! While the rough Gael his nether man arrays In fleecy garb, nor ventures now to bare His hardier skin to cutting mountain air; Ah! why should he alone such luxury know, When gentle maids, the fearless and the fair, Barelegg'd o'er rugged peaks securely go, Nor heed what hurts assail the unprotected toe? XXV But they perchance, in bareness of attire, With their own treeless mountains aptly vie, And 'twere, in us, as idle to desire In northern clime the cloudless southern sky, As to expect, in Gaelic damselry, The trimness of an English maiden's dress; The hose of cotton woof and snowy dyeâ The polish'd shoe, which closely doth compress The small and delicate foot's minuter shapeliness. XXVI And who the pure simplicity shall blame Of Highland maiden, when in mountain stream Knee-deep immersed, she bareth without shame Her dainty limbs to the meridian beam, Faultless in shape, and white as whitest cream,â âFirst glancing round lest stranger eyes be near, (Though curst were he who any ill should dream Gazing on her)âthen swift as mountain deer Plungeth into the burn, and crosseth without fear? XXVII Or who, with frown censorious, would impeach The mysteries grave and deep of laundress skill, When the white linen with bare feet they bleach, In tub which they with purest water fill From the clear depths of neighbouring tarn or rill, Trampling the soaking mass with maiden mirth, And thus their daily task performing still; Fashion most strange to maids of English birthâ The daintiest race and eke the proudest upon Earth! XXVIII Blessings on both, the Saxon and the Gael! The maid of highland hut and English cot! The glory of the glen and of the vale! To each her separate charms let Truth allot; For praise is blame when it exalteth not, Save by disparagement of others good; And let the poet's lay be soon forgot, Who, in sarcastic or contemptuous mood, Shall mar the equal fame of British womanhood. XXIX But we, methinks, have wander'd all too long From the grave tenour of our purposed theme; Back from thy flights discursive, O my song, To where our wanderer, lost in thoughtful dream, Through the bleak moor, across the mountain stream, Up to the topmost point hath wound his way, Which to retreat before him long did seem; And now discerns, far off, Lamlash's bay, And hears its breakers roar, and sees their glittering spray. XXX Not loth is he to mark his journey's end, Bedew'd with Scottish mist for many a mile; And soon, with quicken'd footstep, doth descend The downward slope, contemplating meanwhile The pyramid abrupt of Holy Isle Cresting the narrow strait which girds the shore, And now, thro' flooded creek, and cove, and kyle, Doth, in full tide, its swelling surges pour, And sweep the ribb'd sea sand with thundering rush and roar. XXXI Not tame the view to eyes long used to gaze On England's level meads and hedgerows green, And streams meandering through their sluggish maze, And waving woods, whose foliage dark between Tall spires up-pointing to the skies are seen, And stately mansions their proud summits rear O'er sunny slopes;âyet doth this sea-girt scene Meagre and mean and spiritless appear To favour'd swains who dwell in Brodick's mountain sphere. XXXII For there, begirt by Nature's noblest forms, Doth Caledonia's genius proudly dwell In the mid region of the winds and storms, Enthroned on cloudy peak and pinnacle; While, far below, the ocean-surges swell, Laving a shore with spreading woods o'ergrown; For Art hath there bestow'd her labour well, And o'er the glens a leafy verdure thrown, While here, in barren state, doth Nature reign alone.â XXXIII âIn barren state, nor that with grandeur graced Of form or outline;âupward from the sea Slopes the bare coast, bleak, featureless, and waste, A mountain tractâyet void of majesty; Such as, from time to time, sore vex'd, we see In Scottish region, with unpleasant change Succeeding to the beauty, bold and free, Of lake, and rocky glen, and mountain range, Of aspect ever new, and form abrupt and strange. XXXIV Nor yet more cheerful, to an English eye, The long, straight village, which no rustic taste Hath toil'd, with patient skill, to beautify; Where never yet the cot's outside was graced By woodbine, with dark ivy interlaced, Nor rose nor lily did the air perfume; Nor e'er was porch by clematis embraced, Nor e'er did jasmine round the windows bloom, And from its silver cups shed fragrance thro' the room. XXXV Strange seems it that, in region far renown'd For horticultural skill, such lack should be Of decoration, rife on English ground, E'en in the mean abodes of penury; Where little else, save cleanliness, we see That tells of comfort;âand not small amends Yields it for lack of mountain majesty, That neatness there on poverty attends, And industry and taste together dwell like friends. XXXVI But lovelier yet than ivy-mantled cot, Or garden musical with hum of bees, The grey Church tower on green sequester'd spot, Half hidden by its dark embowering trees, With merry bells that fill the evening breeze With music best befitting English vales;â O! might such temples grace such glens as these! O! might such music on these mountain gales Repeat to Highland hearts their sweet and solemn tales! XXXVII But vain the wish! for here, on hill, in glen, Religion wears her simplest, rudest dress, Spurning each fond device of carnal men To clothe her in external gracefulness: And well doth Scottish architect impress On stone and morter the severest guise Of the old Orthodox unloveliness, Offending vain Episcoplian eyes With kirks of hideous shape, proportion, hue, and size. XXXVIII Scarce more perversely doth Wesleyan pile, Such as in English village we behold, With ostentatious ugliness defile The beauty of the land, in contrast bold Rearing its front near church of Gothic mould, As though in scorn of what fond hearts revereâ The grace and grandeur of the days of oldâ The shrines by ancient piety held dear, Where saintliest knees have knelt in faith and love sincere. XXXIX And, for the music of the belfry chime, One sullen bell in Scottish kirk doth hang, The call to prayer, at stated service time, Reverberating hoarse with iron clang: But never here the mountain echoes rang With wedding peal, whose merry silver sound, In sweeter notes than ever Syren sang, Told its fond tale of bliss and love profound, Which cavern, rock and hill repeated round and round. XL Nor ever here on ear expectant broke The knell which told a neighbour's soul had fled, Conveying, with its sad and solemn stroke, Brief message to the living from the dead; Bidding them think how swift life's current sped, How near the summons to the judgment throne, How short the passage to the wormy bed, How none could know when that might be their ownâ How death's sharp sting is heal'd by Christian faith alone. XLI Such customs, long with Popish rites combined, Doth Scotland's rigorous kirk hold Popish still,â Abominations once, even here, enshrined, As, of old time, in heathen grove and hill, The principalities and powers of Ill; And, tho' they speak to nature's heart of heart, And oft, with holiest glow, men's spirits fill, She from her children keeps them far apart, As hellish snares devised by Rome's malignant art. XLII Even be it so !âfrom Scotland's simple shrines Still let her simpler psalms to Heaven ascend, While the wind, whistling thro' the mountain pines, Doth to the strain accordant music lend, With which their thundering voices cataracts blend; But where, on English plains, cathedral spire Lifts its tall height, let organ-peal attend With notes symphonious the full chaunting choir, Whose anthems breathe to heaven the heavenly soul's desire. XLIII And be the graceful garniture retain'd Of cunning workmanship in stone and wood, And fair large window, gothic-shaped and stain'd With richest dyes, thro' which, in glareless flood, Streams the dim light;âand still let scarf and hood, And surplice white, and academic gown Enrobe her priests, the gracious and the good, Well-train'd and arm'd to beat proud error down, And spread religion's reign and learning's fair renown. XLIV Time was when Church with Kirk,âGeneva cloak With robe and mitre, in fierce wrath have striven, And love's pure law, with mutual rancour, broke, Till, in the name and for the sake of Heaven, The holiest bonds of Earth were rent and riven; But time and wiser thoughts have quell'd that fray; Let each by turns forgiving and forgiven, And each forbearing each, await the day, When truth, more clearly seen, shall drive debate away. XLV Each needs her strength, in this distemper'd age, For other conflicts:âaround either wait The sceptic's scoff, the atheist's impious rage, The hot sectarian's indissembled hate, The cold half-friendship of the wavering State, The brawling demagogue's coarse, ribald yell, The lust of plunder with fierce hope elate; Sad is their doom, in Kedar's tents to dwell, 'Midst enemies to peace who 'gainst all good rebel! XLVI Here pause we,âfor the swiftly gathering crowd Thro' the church doors are thronging, and the rain, From the dark bosom of yon thunder-cloud, In big round drops falls audibly amain; Safe shelter found, our wayfarer is fain, As best he may, his garments drench'd to dry; There let him rest, observing, till again Our song begin, with grave, attentive eye, Whate'er, to him, new sights to-day he may espy. CANTO II. I Sweet! to the wanderer's heart, in foreign land, Whate'er reminds him of that spot of earth Where the tall trees which shade his dwelling standâ The evening light which glimmers round his hearthâ The chamber which beheld his children's birthâ The Church, within whose walls he first became Acknowledged heir of Heaven's uncourted worthâ The altar where his bride, with maiden shame, Pledged herself his till death, in body, soul, and name. II Sweet, and yet sorrowful, each sight and sound Telling his heart of home's far distant bliss, E'en as the ranz des vaches, on foreign ground, O'erwhelms the martial spirit of the Swiss, In thought restoring his wife's farewell kiss, His children's voices, and his mountain cot; Till waking from his dream, he starts to miss Those cherish'd joys, and loathes his soldier lot, Fameâhonourâfortuneâhopeâin that fond grief forgot! III Not alien thou, O Scotland, to the heart Of England, but long since, by many a tie Of law, religion, language, custom, art And mutual service done in days gone by, âYea, by remembrance of past enmity, Each link'd to each;âfor still the noblest foe Becomes the truest friend and best ally When discord's bitter blasts have ceased to blow, And each the other's worth doth, thro' long conflict, know. IV A noble pair are ye, allied no less By contrast than resemblance;âeach doth wear A diverse garb of outward loveliness;â Thou, with thy giant lakes and mountains bare, Where the storms bellow and the lightnings glare, Art robed in grandeur,âwhile her softer grace Of vale, and verdant wood, and pasture fair, Smiles on thy rude sublimity of face, E'en like a gentle bride in a brave man's embrace. V And yet, though dear to wandering Southron's breast, And, e'en when most unlike, resembling still The pleasant land which he must needs love best, That land thou art not, nor its place canst fill So, in his heart, that it shall cease to thrill With fond home-thoughts;âbut oft as he hath found In the wild region of the lake and hill, Aught which appears the growth of English ground, How doth its every pulse with new-born pleasure bound! VI Sweet 'twas to him, amidst Edina's fanes, That Gothic pile episcopal to find, Where the pure form of English worship reigns, In graceful pomp and circumstance enshrined; And there, once more, the willing heart unbind, To alien rites, for many a recent week, Amidst the mountains and wild glens confined,â And hear the English pastor's accent meek, The music, long unheard, of forms liturgic speak! VII Sweet 'twas to note the reverential air Of each new worshipper who bent the knee, Shading his brow meanwhile in silent prayerâ While the deep organ, in accordant key, Sent forth a low, melodious symphony, Prelusive to the swell of choral hymn,â And o'er the soul a hush'd solemnity, Stealing from pillar'd arch and window dim, Raised it to Heaven, as seem'd, on wings of seraphim. VIII O say not this is superstition allâ This solemn awe from solemn places caughtâ This reverence grave which doth man's heart enthrallâ This tuning of the soul to pious thought;â Albeit, perchance, by shrewd contrivance wrought Through architectural grace and music's power. Deem not that lesson all unwisely taught, Which lifts the enfranchised spirit, for an hour, Above those cares of earth, which its best life devour. IX Is it a guilty weakness to have felt A present spirit in the house of God? To love the shrine where saintly knees have kneltâ The marble floor which saintly feet have trod?â To press, with softer tread, the churchyard sod, Beneath whose grassy verdure saints repose Till the last trump shall wake the kneaded clod, And once again the shrouded eyes unclose, To crown with heavenly bliss life's long-forgotten woes? X Would not the soul which felt no reverent awe In Earth's most holy places, still be cold, E'en if reveal'd, Heaven's blissful depths it saw, Throng'd with the spirits of just men of old; And still unmoved, and confidently bold, Gaze with composure on the dreadful throne Whereon his final judgment Christ shall hold, And the dread secrets of all hearts make known, And all his foes condemn, and his redeem'd ones own? XI And yet not so,âfor many a pious heart Hath come to worship in yon kirk to-day, And of that holy feast receive its part, And bear rich blessing to its home away, Which yet no decent reverence deigns to pay To aught which here the mental eye may trace Sacred or solemn;âas they will or may, The groups drop inâno outward sign of graceâ But each, with hat undoff'd, squats down upon his place. XII Ah! well-a-day!âbut this seems wondrous strange! Is this a mart where gossips sell and buy?â A room for lectures, or a stock exchange?â Is that, which seems a pulpit to the eye, A desk where auctioneers their labour ply? Nayâill the day such rash conjectures suit;â Ask not, O Southron gazer, whence or why The Northern vine bears such unshapely fruit;â 'Tis wholesome food, though coarse;âthe tree is sound at root. XIII Now cast thine eyes attentively around;â The Temple and its worshippers survey;â Rude is the first as may on Earth be found; No vain adornments its white walls array, âCarving of oak, or stonework old and gray,â Nor monumental slab, nor sculptured tomb, Where their huge length recumbent warriors lay,â Nor painted glass sheds round cathedral gloom, Nor aught of outward pomp may find permitted room. XIV Oblong the shape;âan area cramm'd with pews, Close, narrow, low, which, at a glance, you see Are such as sturdy Presbyterians use, Who never, e'en in worship, bend the knee. Back'd by the western wall, which fronts the sea, Frowns the grim pulpit, cushionless and bare Of all vain gauds of Popish frippery,â Unlined the sides, uncarpeted the stair,â Wore never hermit's cell a less luxurious air. XV So 'tis most fitting:âso shall issue thence, In strains accordant both to place and theme, The deep-toned flood of Gaelic eloquence, Clear, strong, and rapid, like a mountain stream; Dispersing, in its rush, sin's sensual dream. Ah how unlike the soft luxurious shrine, Which fashion's sickly brood sublimest deem! Where, throned in velvet state, the smug divine Doth his thin, filmy woof of polish'd periods twine. XVI Fronting the pulpit, with capacious span, Yawns a broad arch, through which the wandering eye A separate portion of the kirk may scan; The floor close-pew'd, o'er which extends on high, From side to side, a spacious gallery Assign'd to worshippers of higher class, Where fluttering scarf and gorgeous shawl you spy, Mix'd with such male attire as doth surpass Aught that below appears in all that motley mass. XVII Vacant as yet the seats, for scarce the chime Of neighbouring clock the hour of twelve hath told; Nor oft the rich anticipate the time Of worship; but below you may behold, Assembling slowly, forms of coarser mould; The lowly dwellers in the moor and glen;â Shepherds and hinds, and cottars young and old, And sailors rough, and simple fishermen, Whom fitly to describe o'ertasks poetic pen. XVIII Silent they sit, expectant all and each, When he who leads their worship shall appear; No time for idle thought or idler speech, Or nod of mutual recognition here: No sound, save that of slamming doors, you hear, As the new comers, one by one, stalk in, And take their seats with grave and sturdy cheerâ None breathing, till the service shall begin, A whisper which could drown the dropping of a pin. XIX And some, the lingering moments to beguile, On Scripture page with gaze abstracted pore, Or Psalter turn'd to rhyme in homeliest style, Conning each well-known metre o'er and o'er. Ah! well I wot would David's heart be sore, Could he, return'd to Earth, the wrong behold Done to the strains divine he sung of yore, By British bards, in version new and old, So marr'd with phrase uncouth, and rhyme of rugged mould. XX But neither those twin jinglers of harsh wire, Sternhold and Hopkins, nor that daintier pair, Brady and Tate, have stripp'd the Hebrew lyre Of poesy and music quite so bare (If doggrel we with doggrel may compare) As Scottish bards, whom yet the kirks decree, Expelling hymns profane with pious care, Hath throned in David's seat, that they may be Sole lords throughout the land of song and psalmody. XXI Ah! why forbid the tuneful soul to soar Heavenward, unless on inspiration's wings? Why cramp its flight with chains of Jewish lore? Why blame the music of those later strings, To which the Church her song majestic sings, Attuned to themes of yet diviner strain Than bless'd the ear of prophets or of kings, Before the Son of Man, with toil and pain, Had freed our ransom'd race from Hell's oppressive chain? XXII By seer and psalmist, darkly at the best, Messiah's face, as in a glass, was seen; Dimly, by them, in shadowy lines exprestâ The incarnate glory of its god-like mien Veil'd from our gaze by clouds that float between; Yet not unrecognized by saintly eye, Whether of hind unletter'd, poor and mean, Or studious scholar, skilful to descry Whate'er of old was taught in type and prophecy. XXIII But who shall thus discern, of modern men, The form reveal'd to Hebrew seer sublime, When marr'd and mangled by the reckless pen Of versifier rude, with measured chime Twisting the strain prophetic into rhyme, In parish churches to be shriek'd, not sung, By untaught throats that murder tune and time, In nasal drone and broad provincial tongue, With twang of viols harsh to perfect discord strung? XXIV But Scotland's kirk this last foul murder yet Hath ne'er committed her strict walls within; But loathes the sound of flute and clarionet, Hautboy, and hoarse bassoon and violin, And gruff bass viol with commingled din Deafening the ear;âtheir own harmonious notes Her children raise to heaven, and deem it sin To mar the natural music of their throats With instrumental clang, on which Hell's monarch dotes. XXV And deep and sweet and solemn is the swell Of congregated voices, when they raise The simple strains which Scotland loves so well, Attuned to words, tho' rude, of prayer and praise; Upborne by which the soaring spirit strays Through worlds beyond the bounds of space and time;â Oh! could some bard but lend accordant lays To notes so sweet and utterance so sublime, Methinks e'en Knox's shade might pardon such a crime. XXVI Bolder herein have Wesley's flocks been found, Though far unlike, in all things else, they be The Calvinistic growth of Scottish ground,â Weak, stunted off-shoots of a goodly tree: Yet they, with venturous daring, have set free Both verse and music from those irksome chains Which cramp the wing of statelier psalmody; Recalling banish'd song from sin's domains To praise redeeming love in blithe trochaic strains. XXVII But worthier far to greet angelic ears The hymns in Rome's apostate temples sung To music like the music of the spheresâ Hymns of past ages, when the church was young! Ah! why still shrouded in a foreign tongue? Or why, since purer faith's reviving day, Hath none been found, Britannia's sons among, To cheer her churches with an equal lay?â Arise some bard, and wipe the foul reproach away! XXVIII And yet, (so quickly is the gentle heart By simplest things to keen emotion stirr'd) E'en this rude mockery of poetic art May be to loftiest minstrelsy preferred By those who first, from lips maternal, heard Its rugged rhymes, in tenderest accents, sung;â Lo! where intently scanning line and word, Yon matron sits, a radiant group among Of children, all her ownâyet she both fair and young. XXIX Silent she sits, and yet her lips are moving, In measured cadence, to the psalm she sings To her own heart, whose thoughts meanwhile are roving Through worlds unseen on faith's ethereal wings; Nought marks she now of sublunary things,â The congregating crowdâthe rustic faneâ The infant group around her knees that clings; No sense hath she of mortal joy or pain;â O! might she thus dream on, nor ever wake again! XXX Yet is she rich in this world's purest joy; Heaven hath, with liberal bounty, blest her lot; Witness each bright-eyed girl and blooming boyâ Witness their sire, whose neat sequester'd cot Her smile makes glad;âin truth she needeth not Aught more of earthly bliss than God hath given; Yet never, amidst all, hath she forgot To lay up treasure, costlier far, in Heaven, And prize o'er Earth's best joys the peace of sin forgiven. XXXI But see! the pastor of the flock appears,â A man of rosy cheek and cheerful eye, His age now verging close on fifty years, Which, you may deem, have smoothly glided by; For not a vestige on his brow you spy Of over-anxious care, or thought too deep: Sound doctrine doth he preach, but passing dry,â Which as he drones, o'er hearers' sense doth creep Such calm that some 'gin nod, and some have fallen asleep. XXXII His hour, and with the hour his sermon done, From dreamy doze at once the slumberers start, And loudly all the final psalm intone, Which and the service closed, the larger part Forsake the church, while those of contrite heart Or strict profession, still their seats retain. âOur wanderer with the former shall depart, Deeming it now intrusion rash and vain, Amidst the bidden guests, unbidden, to remain. XXXIII Meanwhile, without the walls, a countless crowd Yon shelter'd pulpit, misnamed tent, surround, Where with alternate rhetoric, long and loud, Saxon and Gael successive texts expound; And ever and anon the solemn sound Of psalms, in Gaelic and in Saxon tongue, Doth from the mountains and huge rocks rebound, As, by a sea of voices old and young, A chorus like the roar of ocean-waves is sung. XXXIV A solemn sound!âa sweet and solemn sight!â The psalmâthe choirâthe temple vast and fair In which all voices with all hearts unite,â Its floor the turfâits roof the boundless airâ Its altar Man's deep heartâits offering prayer, Attuned to melody of sacred song;â In truth, devotion lacks not utterance there, But breathes to Heaven, in accents clear and strong. Strains scarce unfit to sound angelic choirs among. XXXV Thus, between mingled acts of prayer and praise, The day wears on, till lengthen'd shadows fall, And still fresh crowds their solemn chorus raise, And still fresh preachers, with repeated call, Reprove, rebuke, exhort them, one and all; And still new hearers, as the old retire, Fill up of space each vacant interval; Sooner, it seems, the daylight shall expire Than psalm and sermon ceaseâthan flesh or spirit tire. XXXVI 'Tis good for Southron wight to have been here,â Good to have felt the spirit of the place, And witness'd the devotion, deep, sincere, Which fires this sturdy Presbyterian race; Nor deems he that henceforth shall aught efface Remembrance of their worship from his mind: Yet, as he turns, his footsteps to retrace, Is this, thinks he, the holy rite design'd, True Christian hearts in one with heavenly love to bind? XXXVII This countless crowdâthis myriad-throated roar Of voices, echoed back from rock and hill,â Comport they with a spirit sad and sore?â A heart self judgedâa meek and chasten'd will? A conscience troubled by its load of ill? This festival of feeling, wild and high, Ah!âhow unlike that upper chamber still!â That hush of hearts, which felt the hour draw nigh, When on the atoning cross the Son of Man must die! XXXVIII Far better with that hallow'd feast agree The church embosom'd deep in peaceful vale,â The silent groups which humbly bow the knee, In suppliant guise, before the altar rail,â The lowly voice of pastor meek and pale, Who to his hungering flock doth there impart The living bread from heaven which cannot failâ The deep-drawn sighs, which ease the contrite heart, The penitential tears, which there unbidden start. XXXIX So deems our wanderer, and with thoughtful brow Wends homeward through the wind and pelting rain, Which, (through brief rest its strength recover'd now) From masses of black cloud descends again; Gladly shall he his mountain cot regain, Where wife and children his return desire; Nor let him deem this Sunday spent in vain, When, cheer'd by food and clothed in dry attire, He tells what he has seen by summer evening fire. OCCASIONAL POEMS. STANZAS. WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF ARRAN. 1838. I There was a time when scenes like these Which from our cottage door we seeâ Those peaks which seem the clouds to kissâ The sunlight on that crystal seaâ The solemn gloom of yon pine woodâ This burn which glides, in music, by, Had charm'd me to that wish'd-for mood Which oft gives birth to poesy. II 'Tis not so now;âI gaze and gaze, And feed my pleased corporeal sense, As gladly as in earlier days, On Nature's rude magnificence. Each feature of this glorious scene Looks glorious as it look'd of yore, But I am not as I have been,â The spells, which charm'd me, charm no more. III 'Tis not that now, in manhood's prime, My powers have sunk in swift decay;â I rather deem the scythe of Time Hath lopp'd their rank misgrowths away. 'Tis not that now, with soberer will, I shun the visions loved so long;â Full oft my heart is yearning still To mingle with the sons of song. IV It is that life hath lost, for me, The shadowy veil of doubt and fear; That depths, once hid in mystery, Now lie before me close and clear. It is that I can use no more The workings of young Hope within, To gild each outward object o'er With glory to herself akin. V Long since when, in the spring of youth, My spirit wrought on airy themes, Investing with the hues of truth The substance of its wildest dreams,â Then wood and hill and mountain-head, And murmuring stream and billowy sea, With draughts of pure enjoyment fed The inner life of Phantasy. VI Each form of earthly beauty seem'd With its own substance to endue The emptiest joys that Fancy dream'd, Or Hope's delusive pencil drew. And thus, while Earth look'd heavenly-bright, And Hope and Fancy still were strong, Well might I soar, with venturous flight, Through many a dizzy path of song. VII But nowâon life's sunshiny noon There rests a clear, unclouded ray; The lights and shades of star and moon Have faded from the sober day. My heart no more delights to dwell In treacherous dreams of bliss to come;â My present joysâI love them well, But they are, with myself, at home. VIII And Nature's face is now to me No prophecy of times more fair; It speaks no more of things to be, But tells of lovelier things that were. Yon mountain-peaksâthose sea-girt islesâ This sky, too oft with clouds o'ercast, Remind me of life's varying smiles, Its hopes, its fears, its interest past. IX Therefore, albeit I love to muse, In dreamy mood, on days gone by, And still, well-pleased, the face peruse Of stream and mountain, sea and sky,â Not these, nor sights like these awake, In me, the slumbering soul of song, Nor those benumbing fetters break Which Fancy's wing hath felt so long. X My days of tuneful thought are o'er, Nor need I at their loss repine; Since home-content and letter'd lore, And love and friendship still are mine: And pastoral duties, not unblest, With tranquil toil my powers employ; And heavenly hope yields peace and rest Sweeter than Earth's unquiet joy. INSCRIPTION FOR A BUST OF THE LATE WINTHROP MACKWORTH PRAED. Not that in him, whom these poor praises wrong, Gifts, rare themselves, in rarest union dwelt; Not that, reveal'd through eloquence and song, In him the Bard and Statesman breathed and felt;â Not that his nature, graciously endued With feelings and affections pure and high, Was purged from worldly taint, and self-subdued, Till soul o'er sense gain'd perfect mastery;â Not for this only we lament his loss,â Not for this chiefly we account him blest; But that all this he cast beneath the Cross, Content for Christ to live, in Christ to rest. HYMN FOR THE OPENING OF A CHURCH ORGAN. I Throughout all earth, and air, and sea, Sweet sounds our Father bless, In hymns of natural harmony From voices numberless. II The carol shrill of joyous bird,â The hum of honey-bee,â The leaves, by summer breezes stirr'd, Which whisper on the treeâ III The cataract's rush,âthe ocean's roar Unite with one accord, In ceaseless chorus to adore Their ownâall Nature's Lord. IV The Church, with pipes and keys combined By Man's profounder art, Appropriate utterance strives to find For music in her heart. V Father! to-day accept our gift, And by thy presence bless The hymns thy children here uplift To praise thy bounteousness. SONNET I. NEW YEAR'S DAY. Not with solemnities of festal mirth,â The well-spread board, the wine-cup sparkling clear, The laugh of neighbours o'er their Christmas cheer, The gibe and gambol round the blazing hearth,â Not with such rites we celebrate thy birth, And bid thee blithe God-speed! O infant year: Nor yet, in thoughtful mood, with brow severe, Mourning thine elder sisters lost on earth; But with leave-takings, and the bustling care Of packing and of parting:âsad employ! Yet not unmingled with a sober joy; For we, who part, to separate homes repair, So greeting well thy birth; since none may share Life's pleasures undebased by pain's alloy. 1838. SONNET II. Once more the tardy progress of the spring Brings round, beloved, our betrothal day, Rich heretofore in all the sweets which May Did from her teeming lap, prolific, fling; But now the lingering Zephyr's crippled wing Thro' boughs all bare and blossomless doth stray, And scarce have winter's hoar-frosts pass'd away, Or vernal birds begun as yet to sing. But let the laggard and distemper'd year Frown as it lists;âwe two have sunshine still, Warming with love sweet wedlock's atmosphere; And many a bubbling fount and sparkling rill Of joy and peace makes music sweet and clear For us, scarce yet descending life's steep hill. 1838. SONNET III. Cousin, the phantom voice of other years Spake to me, as I sat by thee once more, And saw thee what thou wast in days of yore, Unfaded yet by life's thick-gushing tearsâ While thy loved voice made music in my ears, Such as it did ere boyhood's dream was o'er, Or manhood yet had found its present store Of household joys and sorrows, hopes and fears. Now in two worlds we dwell, by different cares And sympathies begirt;âyet each, I trust, Employ'd in tasks through which high Heaven prepares For its own bliss the faithful and the just. There may our spirits meet, as now our prayers, When our dust, cousin, hath return'd to dust. 1837. SONNET IV. WRITTEN IN THE HIGHLANDS. Through islet-sprinkled lakes, embosom'd deep In mountains crown'd with yet unmelted snow, While o'er their heathery sides bright wild-flowers grow,â Through rocky glens, in which, from steep to steep, With rush and roar, the mountain torrents leap,â O'er Inverara's heights,âthrough wild Glencroeâ (Delight and wonder kindling as we go) From Arran's distant isle our course we keep. But ask me not to paint what here we see, With graphic pen, though all be passing dear To memory;âfor this outward world, to me, Hath never been of tuneful thought the sphere; My realm of song is human hope and fear, Joy, grief, domestic peace and fireside glee. 1839. SONNET V. LOCH RANZA. From Brodick's matchless bay, along the shore Of Arran northward, past the Sannox glen, Her freight of sketching dames and wondering men Our crowded steamboat to Loch Ranza bore Which when we enter'dâall my hopes were o'er; Nought found I there to task poetic pen: But one there was, who with an artist's ken Gazed at the scene, and straight began to pour Artistic raptures about light and shadeâ And how effectively these thints would lie, And how much of those outlines might be made; Yet he, with slender notice, had pass'd by Glen-Sannox gorge.âHow unlike mine his trade! How far the painter's from the poet's eye! 1839. SONNET VI. TO MY INFANT DAUGHTER. My daughter!âin that name appear fulfill'd The cherish'd dreams of many wedded years; Child of as many wishes, hopes and fears, As e'er through poet's restless bosom thrill'd, How doth thy rising star serenely gild, For me, the horizon of this vale of tears! Which, in its tender light, almost appears A place where Hope her final home might build. But with a deeper joy I greet thy birth, For that hereafter, as I fondly trust, Thou shalt make glad thy mother's home and hearth, When she shall mourn (as soon or late she must) Her lack-land sons dispers'd throughout the earth,â Her husband, and his follies, in the dust. 1837. SONNET VII. TO MY YOUNGEST CHILD. I would not have it said that thou alone, My latest-born, hast been unsung by me, Of six whom I have dandled on my knee, Some among whom have, many a year, outgrown Parental dandling:âtherefore, for thine own, Take now this sonnet,âthough perchance to thee, But little versed in lore of A, B, C, 'Twill seem a mystery better left unknown. Right glad am I that thou art thus devoid Of erudition;âthat thy tender age Hath been in healthier toil, till now, employ'd Than poring o'er some spelling-book's dull page;â That thou, a poet's daughter, hast enjoy'd Life's early dawn unpent in schoolroom cage. 1843. SONNET VIII. With fond parental pride did I devote This pair of sister Sonnets to the press;â Short-sighted dreamer!âlittle did I guess That, at the moment when the words I wrote, Did Azrael's dusky wing already float O'er both those gentle heads!âThat sore distressâ Those long, long weeks of death's own bitterness Are pastâthe Arm, thrice lifted, never smote. For this deep mercy be the Chastener blest! And ye, my children, from the grave's embrace Deliver'dâour lost treasure repossestâ May ye, henceforth, by yet diviner grace Made doubly His, so run your earthly race That ye in Heaven with holiest saints may rest! 1843. SONNET IX. Six weeks of anxious watching and suspense, With ceaseless ebbs and flows of hope and dread, A tinge of silver o'er thy locks hath shed, Dimming, in part, their dark magnificence, Which else perchance had, many a summer hence, As in time past, still graced thy matron head; Grey hast thou grown beside our children's bed, Raised, through thy care, from stroke of pestilence: Therefore, O best-belov'd, more deeply now Those streaks of summer snow do I hold dear Than the pure jet which shaded thy young brow When, at the altar's rail, with hearts sincere We plighted, each to each, our nuptial vow; âMother and wife on Earth without a peer! 1843. SONNET X. TO THE AUTHORESS OF âI WATCH'D THE HEAVENS.â Within two miles of glorious dale and hill, Lady, we two from infancy were bred; And bravely (doubt not) were our spirits fed On forms and hues which there with beauty fill Meadow and valley, rock, and wood, and rill; Each, by a guidance which we knew not, led Through discipline, which train'd both heart and head The Bard's mysterious mission to fulfil. Nor grudge I, but rejoice, that Heaven to thee Allots the loftier task, the nobler powers, Teaching thy wing to soar, thine eye to see Beyond the bounds of this gross world of ours; While I, confined to Earth's green banks and bowers, Pipe my wild notes of human grief and glee. 1843. STANZAS. TO THE SAME. I Some five and twenty years have pastâ (It may be moreâit may be lessâ) Since first we metâand parted last,â A poet and a poetess. II That first and last and only time Did we (whose hearts e'en then were swelling With thoughts, ere long to bloom in rhyme) Converse within one earthly dwelling. III A dark-hair'd girlâa stripling tallâ (For then no lath than I was thinner) We sat within thy Father's Hall, Among sedater guests, at dinner. IV We talk'd, as youthful poets use, Of high imaginative matters; Of Scott's and Moore's and Byron's Muse,â Of Odes and EpicsâSongs and Satires;â V Of Music and the sister arts, Save oneâalas! denied to thee, Though mostly dear to female heartsâ The art of gay Terpsichore. VI To Her, in that same festive Hall, Had I, in strange, fantastic motion, Obedient to the fiddle's call, Paid, oft ere then, my young devotion. VII And graceful forms and eyes of light, Before my raptured vision glancing, Had held me through the livelong night, In love's wild dreams my soul entrancing. VIII Each formâeach faceâeach thrilling tone, Which charm'd me then, is now forgot; One face remains,âone voice alone From Memory's ear departeth not. IX A Presence of mysterious power (But dimly then discern'd by me) Had through my spirit, in that hour, Diffused itself insensibly. X And hence that hour of converse still, While years have faded, seemeth near; Like some sun-gilded, distant hill Seen through a rain-fraught atmosphere. XI And if no more we meet on Earth, 'Twill be a pleasant thought to me, That the same haunts which gave thee birth Were mine from tenderest infancy. XII The bold Clee Hillâthe winding Temeâ The glorious woods of Mawley Hallâ The banks of Rea's romantic streamâ We both have known and loved them all. XIII Yes!âboth have loved them;âthou no less Than I (though thine no earthly strain) Dost, from that region's loveliness, Pure springs of inspiration drain. XIV Heaven speed thee, lady, in thy flight Through worlds of song beyond my ken! Heaven guide that wing of female might Where few can soar of mightiest men! XV And though thou fall'st on evil days For daughters, as for sons, of Song, Doubt not the echo of thy lays In many a heart shall linger long. XVI Nor now this cordial praise repel From one who glories that, in thee, Amidst the scenes he loves so well Was born a nobler Bard than he. 1843. LAMENT FOR THE DOON. Air.âThe Rhine! the Rhine! I The Doon!âthe Doon!âour own romantic river! We tread thy banks no moreâwe tread thy banks no more; Thy stream's bright gush is lost to us for ever, Its home-sweet music o'erâits home-sweet music o'er. CHORUS. The Doon!âthe Doon!âmourn, sires grown old befor us, Your birthright lost too soonâyour birthright lost too soon; Youths, maidens, wives, take up our wailing chorus! Weep, children, for the Doon!âweep, children, for the Doon! II The Doon!âthe Doon!âthine own great Bard hath made thee Of Earth's famed rivers oneâof Earth's famed rivers one; Thy banks, thy braes, each tree that droops to shade thee, Immortal praise hath wonâimmortal praise hath won. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. III But Doon, fair Doonâwhy doth my memory hover O'er thee in tearful thoughtâo'er thee in tearful thought? Boyhood had past, and youth's best days were over, Ere thou to me wast aughtâere thou to me wast aught. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. IV But Doon, bright Doon, thy waters leapt to greet me, When wedded love was youngâwhen wedded love was young; And on thy banks new friends came forth to meet me,â Warm heart and cordial tongueâwarm heart and cordial tongue. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. V The Doon!âthe Doon!âremembrance yet rejoices O'er bliss beside thee feltâo'er bliss beside thee felt;â The old plain homeâthe cheerful looks and voices Which round its hearthstone dweltâwhich round its hearthstone dwelt. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. VI The Doon!âthe Doon!âthose looks no more shall cheer me On thy deserted shoreâon thy deserted shore; Those tones which told what friendly hearts beat near me, Shall bless mine own no moreâshall bless mine own no more. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. VII But Doon, sweet Doon! untouch'd some hearts behold thee, For whom thy bright waves ranâfor whom thy bright waves ran; One, long thy lord, to alien hands hath sold theeâ That calm, grey-headed manâthat calm, grey-headed man. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. VIII Yet, Doon, lost Doonâthe love of thy clear waters Must still his spirit swayâmust still his spirit sway; Woe!âwoe for him!âhis sons!âhis blooming daughters!â Their birthright cast away?âtheir birthright cast away! The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. IX But Doon, sweet Doon!âthy murmurs will not reach them, Where Fashion rules their lotâwhere Fashion rules their lot; Strange are their hearts to lore which thou wouldst teach them;â Sweet Doon, they love thee notâsweet Doon, they love thee not. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. X But woe for Her whose home hath been beside thee For many an anxious yearâfor many an anxious year! From whose deep love no change shall e'er divide thee, Nor make thy banks less dearânor make thy banks less dear. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. XI And woe for those, whose weary footsteps wander Far in the burning Eastâfar in the burning East! Whose hearts e'en now, perchance, still vainly ponder O'er hopes which here have ceasedâo'er hopes which here have ceased. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. XII And woe for Her o'er whom, as lost, we sorrow,â Our once loved meetings o'erâour once loved meetings o'er! 'Midst alien cares, her grief, perchance, shall borrow A voice from mine once moreâa voice from mine once more. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. XIII Yes, woe for her!âsound sleeps her virgin sister Beneath our Southern sodâbeneath our Southern sod; Joy to her now!âlong, long our homes have miss'd her;â But hers hath been with Godâbut hers hath been with God. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. XIV The Doon!âthe Doon!âalong thy banks, sweet river, My first-born's steps have stray'dâmy first-born's steps have stray'd; Thy voice, I trust, shall haunt his thought for ever, Till Memory's self shall fadeâtill Memory's self shall fade. The Doon!âthe Doon! &amp;c. XV The Doon!âthe Doon!âstill, still to sons and daughters Fond tales of thee we'll tellâfond tales of thee we'll tell; Though we no more must gaze upon thy waters;â Our own sweet Doon, farewell!âour own sweet Doon, farewell! CHORUS. The Doon!âthe Doon!âmourn, sires grown old before us, Your birthright lost too soonâyour birthright lost too soon. Youths, maidens, wives, take up our wailing chorus! Weep, children, for the Doon!âweep, children, for the Doon! 1837. LAYS OF THE PARISH. EUTHANASIA. I The world is full of lovely things; We need not borrow Fancy's wings To waft us through the sky In quest of change, through any dearth Of glorious objects here on Earth To feed our inward eye. II Nor deem I that all-bounteous Heaven Hath, to the poet only, given A power which doth reveal, In Nature's every sound and sight, Deeper and more intense delight Than common souls can feel. III 'Tis holy Loveâ'tis Faith and Hope, Which Beauty's secret chambers ope To minds of humblest mould; And paths of heavenly light are trod On Earth by every child of God, Which no gross eyes behold. IV And heâthere's not a spot so sad But he can make it bright and glad; No scene so dark and drear, But he therein doth well discern Celestial lights, which blaze and burn Through its thick atmosphere. V In towns or woods, on towers or trees, The impress of God's hand he sees, And hears his well-known voice; In hope and fear, in woe and weal, His presence doth he ever feel, And in His smile rejoice. VI With searching glance 'tis his to scan The deep, mysterious heart of manâ Its secret movements trace; The spirit's silent growth to mark, And track, through windings dim and dark, The wondrous stream of grace. VII The griefs and joys which others feel More closely to his heart appeal Than godless minds can guess; 'Tis his with all to smile and weep, And share, with fevour kind and deep, Their joy and their distress. VIII And thus,âwhate'er his walk may be,â Full of sweet sympathies is he With pleasure and with pain; Wherever human hearts are found, Feeling and thought for him abound;â The world is his domain. IX In court or camp, in hall or cot, Rich contemplations fail him not;â A peasant at the ploughâ A soldierâor a merchant graveâ A monarchâor a menial slaveâ His heart hath range enow. X And yet, methinks, one task there is More sweetly and more truly his Than other tasks can be;â The gospel message to convey To souls from Heaven still far astray;â The task assign'd to me. XI To us, and to our pastoral care, Is many a human heart laid bare In many a varying mood; All human sorrows, doubts and fears, All cares and troubles, smiles and tears, Supply our mental food. XII To us the wounded spirit flees For words of comfort to appease Its own afflictive smart; The penitent, by fears opprest, Comes to us, and asks ease and rest For his o'er-burden'd heart. XIII Our aid is lent, our prayers are said By saint and sinner's dying bed To us, in life's last hour, Confidingly both young and old The soul's mysterious depths unfoldâ Its weakness and its power. XIV Then, if I may revive once more The powers, which, ere life's spring was o'er, Were mine, or seem'd to be,â What need to urge, beyond the sphere Of vision which surrounds me here, My light-wing'd phantasy? XV Nought care I for heroic strains;â I leave to bolder hearts and brains The lofty epic style; Enough for me what I can win Of calm and tender thought, within The space of one square mile! XVI Here, in this quiet shelter'd spot, Where Providence hath cast my lot, In love and peace, so long,â This spot, which saw my children's birthâ Here, by my own still blissful hearth, Shall be my world of song. XVII From things which gladden or which grieve Familiar hearts, my Muse shall weave Such garlands as she can; Noting, in this her narrow sphere, All storms which shake, all gleams which cheer The troublous soul of Man. XVIII So now to hearts of gentle mould A simple tale will I unfoldâ A tale of humble love, Of suffering long and faith intense, In one who late departed hence To dwell with Christ above. XIX Of humble parentage was she, And yet not born in poverty, No child of want or shame; Her parents still in comfort dwell, And earn a decent living well, And bear an honest name. XX Herselfâin sooth I would not speak Of beaming eye or blooming cheek, Fine form, or noble mien, Had such been hers:â'twould suit as well The unromantic tale I tell, Had she an Ethiop been. XXI There are, whose chance-caught looks express An intellectual loveliness, Which makes us turn and start, Even when no outward sign we trace Of beauty in the form and faceâ Looks kindled from the heart. XXII But such were not her looks or mienâ No token in her face was seen Of genius rich and rare; Even though you sought, you scarce would find A symptom of superior mind, Or high-wrought feeling there. XXIII She was a meek and simple maid As ever roam'd in greenwood shade, Or sat in summer bower; Though little of green shades or woods, Lone dells or silent solitudes, Knew she, or felt the power. XXIV Scant store of sentiment refined Had sheâher pure but humble mind Small culture e'er had known; Few were her books, nor much she sought, Through knowledge gain'd of others' thought, To elevate her own. XXV So fares it oft with those design'd The loftiest place 'midst human kind In other worlds to hold; Though here they seem, to human eye, Compass'd with much infirmityâ The feeblest of the fold. XXVI We see not how their spirits grow, We know not whence the breezes blow Which life to them convey; Through what dim workings of the thought The silent work of grace is wrought, And error purged away. XXVII But mark them wellâin lowliest hut, Or, poorest among paupers, shut Within a workhouse walls; And you will own that heavenly light, In streams of glory pure and bright, On their weak spirits falls. XXVIII No doubts have they through learned pride; They hear God's promise and confide,â Their faith is faith indeed; And thus from height to height they go Of hope and love, while we, below, Plod on with laggard speed. XXIX Yet was not she, of whom I speak, Left all her little lore to seek, Or rear her own poor thought; But placed beneath the Christian rule Of one who kept a daily school, And Christ's pure lessons taught. XXX Nor may we deem the years mis-spent, In which, from day to day, she went To that instructress kind; Though then no goodly growth was rear'd, No promise of rich grace appear'd To blossom in her mind. XXXI Her teacher plough'd the virgin ground, And scatter'd in its soil profound The seed of truth divine; Which there unseen, unnoticed lay, Till on her heart, with quickening ray, Religion's sun should shine. XXXII And thus her tender years were pastâ Until the time arrived at last When she, a woman grown, Should, as the Church's laws allow, Renewing the baptismal vow, Confirm it as her own. XXXIII A blessed time is that to me,â Of all my pastoral ministry, To toil most pleasant given; When, face to face, in conference sweet, The younglings of my flock I meet, To speak of Christ and Heaven. XXXIV A blessed time, when heavenly truth Press'd firmly on the mind of youth In many a close appeal, Lays bare undreamt-of depths within, And the whole mystery of sin Doth startlingly reveal. XXXV A time of fresh and fervent thought, When Heaven and Hell at once are brought Before the young mind's eye; And the thick veil is rent in twain Which on the wondrous world had lain Of immortality. XXXVI So fell it in that maiden's case; The deep, mysterious work of grace Seem'd then, in her, begun; The seeds, in childhood sown, then first To life and sudden vigour burst, Beneath religion's sun. XXXVII With thoughtful brow and tearful eye She heard, and in her heart laid by The lessons then instill'd; Truths known, but never felt before, Which now she ponder'd o'er and o'er, Through soul and spirit thrill'd. XXXVIII And when the holy rite was done, And from the altar, one by one, Her young companions pass'd, Whatever thoughts in them might stirâ Some had, that day, been waked in her, Which would for ever last. XXXIX The emptiness she now had learn'd Of things belowâhad well discern'd The worth of things not seen, And, in the Everlasting arms, From Earth's temptations, Hell's alarms, Received and shelter'd been. XL Strange passage! from youth's dreams of bliss Investing such a world as this With glory most untrue, To calmest faith and sober love, Which almost bring the world above Within the Christian's view. XIL Strange passage!âand to her most blest!â For so she found a place of rest And comfort all her own, When on her gentle head did rain A storm of such fierce grief and pain As few on Earth have known. XLII When summer leaves were on the boughs, She ratified her Christian vows, Began her Christian race; But long ere winter's icy chain Was broke, disease and bitterest pain Had paled her patient face. XLIII She came to church on Christmas Day, The homage of her love to pay, And celebrate His birth, Who, eighteen hundred years ago, Exchanged Heaven's bliss for human woe, And dwelt with Man on Earth. XLIV That morn what peaceful joy was hers, As with his chosen worshippers She at his altar knelt! But ere another Sabbath day, Ah me! how like a corpse she lay! And yet what anguish felt! XLV Hard lot, ye think, my readers young, While every heart and every tongue Save hers was full of glee, And friends and neighbours vied in mirth By well-spread board and blazing hearth, To groan with agony. XLVI Hard lot, ye think, was that for her; And yet was she (I dare aver) Far happier where she lay, Than could the loudest laugher be Of any joyous company Which then kept holiday. XLVII Far happierâfor her Saviour stood Beside her in her solitude,â Beside her stood and smiled; And sounds were to her soul convey'd, Which seem'd to say âBe not afraid, Mine own adopted child.â XLVIII A peace seraphic, night and day, Upon her gentle spirit lay,â Peace, sent her from above, Which told that nought which might betide Thence-forward should her soul divide From Heaven's eternal love. XLIX And think ye, while she felt this peace, Nor fear'd lest it should ever ceaseâ That she could wish to be Once more with a light-hearted crowd, Midst roars of laughter long and loud, And boisterous revelry? L Would she one glimpse of Heaven forego For all Earth's merriment?âah, no! Her ties to Earth are burst; She listens to the angels' song, In draughts of rapture, deep and long, She slakes her spirit's thirst. LI Whoso had look'd on that sick bed With thoughtful eye, must needs have said A contrast strange was there; Disease and racking pain withoutâ Withinâa soul from fear and doubt Made free as summer air. LII And yet 'twas pitiful to see With what extreme severity Heaven chasten'd its dear child; What pangs did that weak frame devour, From day to day, from hour to hour, Made fiercer and more wild. LIII In sooth but slender skill have I In phrase of learn'd anatomy; Nor know I how to name Whatever tortures urge the pulse To wildest throbbings, or convulse Our sinful human frame. LIV Yet I may say no limb was free From its peculiar agony, But, downward from the face, Through all her frame convulsions went, Which every separate fibre rent In swift and ceaseless race. LV From year to year did she sustain A dread diversity of pain, Still gathering more and more; And this physicians did declareâ That all which flesh and blood can bear Their gentle patient bore. LVI So three years pass'd;âthe fourth begunâ We deem'd that now her race was run, Her conflict nearly o'er; For then a storm of pain did pierce Each part, more fiery and more fierce Than she had felt before. LVII Nor was this all;âthe light of day Was now for ever swept away, And ceaseless night began; Her eyelids closed, nor might she trace Thenceforward any friendly face Or form beloved of Man. LVIII You deem perhaps that then she found Some compensation from the sound Of living voices near; That friends would from a distance walk, With pleasant and familiar talk Her loneliness to cheer. LIX And that beside her dying bed From morn to night her sisters read Sweet words of truth divine; And prayers were said, and hymns were sung, And comfort dropp'd from many a tongue More eloquent than mine. LX Ah, no!âso fierce her tortures were That she could now no longer bear The softest human tone; A footstep, though it trod on down,â The rustle of a silken gown Thrill'd through her to the bone. LXI And thus they lay (her pain and she) In sorrowful society, While twelve months more roll'd by; She wasting silently away With imperceptible decay, And yet too strong to die. LXII 'Twas the meek patience of her heart Which, through such fierce and fiery smart, Her life did long sustain; And had her faith and love been less, She had escaped the bitterness Of many a month of pain. LXIII Throughout that time full oft did I For entrance to her room apply, Which mostly was denied; Such were her pangs, she could not bear A soothing word, a whisper'd prayer Put up at her bedside. LXIV At last the final conflict came, Each part of her exhausted frame Had borne its share of woe; The lungs with inflammation dire Were last attack'd, and raging fire In every vein did glow. LXV Then 'twas that me they came to call In her last tranquil interval Of partial rest from pain; Such rest as lulls the wintry deep, When the spent storms at evening sleep, Ere morn to wake again. LXVI I came;âher quick and struggling breath Told of the near approach of death, As by her side I stood; Her painful toil was nearly done, The conflict o'er, the victory won, The sinful soul renew'd. LXVII A glorious sight it is to see A dying saint's felicity, When death draws gently nigh, And no sharp pangs disturb the peace Preceding the glad soul's release, Or clog the parting sigh. LXVIII A glorious sight!âfor then Heaven's field Seems to be visibly reveal'd To faith's expiring gaze; And we almost can hear the hymn Which cherubim and seraphim For its new inmate raise. LXIX But deaths like this, I deem, are rare, For mortal weakness, pain and care, Cleave to us to the last; And few of saintliest souls there be From all life's galling bonds set free Till life itself is past. LXX O! shame! eternal shame to them Who would the penitent condemn In his expiring hour, Because his fainting soul is toss'd By waves of doubt, nor yet hath lost All sense of hellish power. LXXI O! shame to such! they little know The warfare to be waged below,â The mystery, dark and strange, Of inextinguishable sin, Subjecting the whole world within To doubt and fear and change. LXXII By many a death-bed have I stood Both of the wicked and the good, And this will I maintain,â That while the former smile on death, The latter oft yield up their breath In trouble, fear, and pain. LXXIII But such was not our sister's doom:â Strong pains she had, but care and gloom And fear had fled for aye; One toilsome fight was still to win, And thenâfarewell to grief and sin! And welcome endless day! LXXIV And yet no rapturous flights had she Of feeling or of phantasy, No visions heavenly-bright; 'Twas patience all, and faith and love, Which with her giant sufferings strove, And triumph'd through God's might. LXXV Once, as I bent above her bedâ âNow, Mary, you approach,â I said, âDeath's dark and shadowy vale;ââ âIt is not darkââwas her reply, And a faint smile pass'd radiantly Across her features pale. LXXVI No more she spoke;âher anguish grew Fiercer and fiercer, till we knew The final strife was come; At length the web of life was rent, And, with a sigh, her spirit went To its eternal home. LXXVII But was this all?âto mortal eye No more 'twas granted to descry; And yet the soul within Had felt a more stupendous strife,â The struggle between death and life, Heaven's grace and human sin. LXXVIII By prayer intense and fervent thought, Strange transformation had been wrought In all the inner man; And ever, as the flesh decay'd, The spirit was more heavenly made, A steadier race she ran. LXXIX Yet think not that her sainted soul Of peace and joy attain'd the goal By easy steps and few; Or that from height to height she went With swift and regular ascent, As happy angels do. LXXX Ah, no!âthough now, for many a year, She to her Saviour had been dear, And in his flock received,â The Tempter's power was not yet past, But still assai'd her to the last, As ere she first believed. LXXXI Full surely, all the time, he knew That all his legions were too few, His subtlest efforts vain, The ranks of that bright host to stir, Invisibly encamp'd round her, As on a battle plain. LXXXII Yet though he could not overcome, Nor lure her from her heavenly home, Dread power he wielded still; Power to disturb, to haunt, to vex, Confuse and fearfully perplex With dreams obscure of ill. LXXXIII The sin which still was unsubdued, In many a dark and dreary mood, He show'd to her mind's eye In frightful forms and hues intense, O'erwhelming her bewilder'd sense With fear and agony. LXXXIV Doubts and dark thoughts did he suggest, Robbing her soul of peace and rest;â âO am I christ's indeed,â So weak of faith, so cold in love?â Could he who lives and reigns above For such a sinner bleed?â LXXXV âHath all this sharp and bitter pain, Borne for long years, been borne in vain?â Is all this woe for nought?â Is this vile heart e'en now unchanged? From Himâfrom hopeâfrom Heaven estranged?â âThus darkly fancy wrought. LXXXVI But soon such terrors pass'd away, And then in bliss untold she lay, Though still in grievous pain; Heaven's gates once more were open thrown, And Faith and Hope and Love came down To dwell with her again. LXXXVII Nor lack'd she, ere her anguish grew Too deadly, friends, nor cold nor few, Who daily to her came, Spake with her of Christ's dying love, And soar'd with her, in thought, above This world of sin and shame. LXXXVIII And blest, to her, those seasons were, When to her chamber did repair Souls touch'd by grace divine; And the Lord's table there we spread, And bless'd and brake the living bread, And shared the mystic wine. LXXXIX Thus joy and grief together wrought To purify her springs of thought, Her heart for Heaven to train; Thus was her spirit cleansed from guilt, And God therein a temple built Where He might ever reign. XC Nor did her faith and patience (shown Thus sweetly) to herself alone Most rich in blessing prove; For few to her sick chamber came In whom she kindled not the flame Of her celestial love. XCI The careless, when her pangs they view'd So meekly borne, with hearts subdued And sadden'd went away; The weak grew strong, the timid bold, Her patient warfare to behold With suffering and decay. XCII She was a silent preacher, sent (Silent, but O! most eloquent!) To teach us how to die; Showing o'er what fierce depths of pain A tender maiden's soul can gain, Through faith, the victory. XCIII But little now remains to say; She died ere dawn upon the day Of last St. Valentine; And on the following Monday morn, With reverence, to her grave was borne;â The last sad office mine. XCIV Few mourners at her burial were, In truth, the day was far from fair; And while along the street The scant and slow procession pass'd, The thickening clouds pour'd down full fast A storm of rain and sleet. XCV Yet One there was whom all respect,â A man of noblest intellect, Great heart, and station high, Who, that day, all his toils forsook, And on her funeral came to look With sad and reverent eye. XCVI For service high perform'd to truth, For Christian lessons taught to youth, Deep thanks to him are due; And I, for one, may truly say How happy I esteem the day When first his worth I knew. XCVII Yet ne'er, methinks, for him I felt Respect so deep as when we knelt Together by her bier, And I beheld him not too proud, Amidst the meanest of the crowd, To drop a parting tear. XCVIII To him, with cordial heart, to-day, Written in 1834. I dedicate this humble lay, Which he will not despise, But treasure as a record true Of one whose faith on earth he knew, Now throned above the skies. THE SONG OF THE KETTLE. I What decks our sober parsonage to-day With this unusual pomp of festal show? What mean these tents, bedight with streamers gay? These tables, spread in long continuous row?â This throng of busy peasants to and fro? Yon maypole wreathed with yet unfaded flowers, Braving the blasts that all too wintry blow, And ever and anon, with sleety showers, Bemock the cold mid-May of this wild clime of ours? Written in 1839. II Not without previous care and tasteful toil Hath all this rural pageantry been wrought; But yesternight the meadows' flowery spoil, By children's hands with childish ardour sought, Was to our pastor's busy parlour brought, And then and there did gentle ladies twine Those flowery wreaths, and with fantastic thought, Primrose and cowslip and blue bell combine In forms and hues so rich as mock this verse of mine. III And here, all day, since earliest peep of dawn, Hath rustic labour preparation made For feats gymnastic on the wanton lawn, With stroke and thrust of hammer, saw, and spade; Here tilters deft shall dexterously evade The quintain's swift and ignominious blow;â Here shall the wrestler at his length be laid, Lock'd in the gripe of his victorious foe; Here youths and maids shall point the light fantastic toe. IV But wherefore here? where solemn thought should dwell, And heavenly contemplation oft be found, And silence house, as in a hermit's cell, And pious cares and studies aye abound, Untroubled by the world's intrusive sound?â Why all this coil of boisterous frolic here? Startling the tenants of the graves around, And ever bursting on the living ear With uproar meeter sure for some less sober sphere? V 'Tis not our pastor's wont, nor e'er hath been, Since first in Christian fold a flock he fed, To mingle with gay crowds in festal scene;â Full surely to the world we deem'd him dead, A life so grave and sober hath he led, Shunning whate'er to puritanic eye Might cause offence;âso much he seem'd to dread, Lest keen schismatics should in him espy Occasion to impeach and mar his ministry. VI No feaster he, nor sportsman, nor alert At feats athleticâsave that, in his day, At England's game of games he was expert, And loved with jovial cricketers to play, So wasting many a summer holiday; But now that pastime too he doth forego, Nor e'er in flannel garb his loins array, Nor arm his foot with iron spikes below, Nor wield the ponderous bat with skilful block and blow. VII A graver interest warms his heart to-day, Grave meaning lurks beneath his mirthful mood, Some graver purpose owns this trim array Of tents and tables piled with daintiest foodâ These garlands wreath'd by tasteful womanhoodâ This preparation for athletic sport;â Mock not, ye gracelessâmarvel not, ye good;â Here Temperance holds to-day her solemn court, Whereto her liegemen true, in festive pomp, resort. VIII A Power benignant she, and once on Earth Well known and honour'd;âhealth's secure ally, Sworn friend of household peace and social mirth, And happiness, and love, and liberty; Sedate her mien and modest is her eye, From meretricious wiles exempt and pure; No care hath she, the casual passer by With smiles of harlot blandishment to lure, But wins by quiet worth, and knows her triumph sure. IX Small store of season'd viands loads her board, No sparkling wine-cup at her feasts is seen; Yet she the choicest dainties doth afford To healthful tastes, and reigns in state serene, Of true convivial joys the sovereign queen; Hers is the cheerful home, the fire-side glee, The rustic game, the dance upon the green;â And eke the kettle's song, the toast, the tea, The gleam of household smiles, from guilt and sorrow free. X Ah me! that ever nymph so fair and good Men should have banish'd from our luckless isle Through lust of tempting drink and luscious food, Duped and enslaved by that enchanter vile, Accursed Comus, who doth yet defile Our homes and hearths with riotous excess, Stealing the heart and brain with treacherous guile, And breeding deadlier woe than thought can guess Through brutish sensual waste and filthy drunkenness. XI O shun his proffer'd draught, unthinking swains, In whom not yet is appetite subdued To Reason's temperate rule;âthat cup contains Circeian juice with poisonous drugs imbued Whereof who freely drinks, albeit endued With natural graces manifold, casts off His better self, grows sensual, wild and lewd, And doth at life's true pleasures rail and scoff, Herding with human swine, and wallowing in their trough. XII Yet sweet, at first, the luscious beverage seems, Which, like an adder, stingeth at the last,â The wine that sparkles in rich ruby gleams, The ale by amber's clearness unsurpass'd;â And pleasures throng around it thick and fastâ Gay spiritsâgenerous feelingsâsocial glee, And blithe good humour by no cloud o'ercast,â Frolic and song and laughter loud and freeâ Yea, all the joys that wait on jocund jollity. XIII Right pleasant 'twere to quaff that charmed cup, And feel its inspiration rich and fine, Were no sharp bitters with the dregs mix'd up, Were social gladness all that flows from wine; Then Bacchus were indeed a god divine, And Circe's son a welcome guest on Earth; But soon alas! those giddy joys decline, And furious folly takes the place of mirth, And fever'd brain and blood to lust and rage give birth. XIV Strange sight it is, I ween, at lordly feast, Or alehouse revel, (as the case may be) To mark the gradual change of man to beast, The quick transition from convivial glee To tipsy fun and senseless ribaldry; Thence to mad riot and unseemly brawl, Or brutish, base insensibility, As, in their strength or weakness, one and all, Beneath the enchanter's spell, in swift succession fall. XV Gentle at first his stealthy influence seems; He opens the shut heart, and frees the tongue Of shy reserve, and lights the eye with gleams Of kindling humour round the table flung, And cheers the drooping soul which seem'd unstrung For boisterous joys, and tunes the timid voice To jovial ditties in full chorus sung, And charms the ear with talk so quaint and choice As makes the dull applaudâthe sorrowful rejoice. XVI Anon a change doth o'er this spirit pass, Discourse more freely, but less clearly, flows; This grows a pert, and that a solemn ass, And maudlin fervour makes sworn friends of foes, Till from embraces straight they come to blows, (Extremes so nearly meet,) and you may see Black eye, and broken head, and bloody nose, Marring the mirth of this fair company;â Sure Circe's swine themselves could scarce more swinish be. XVII And one, with solemn air and swimming eyes, Draws saws of tipsy morals to deaf ears; One, at full length, beneath the table lies In most unsavoury plight, nor sees nor hears The brawls or babble of his drunk compeers, So well the wine hath done its work on him; There let him lie till sober morn appears, Then wake with throbbing brow and aching limb;â Woke never mortal wight in more unseemly trim. XVIII Time was when scenes like these you might behold E'en in the Palace-Halls of Albion's isle; So closely did the curst Enchanter hold Peasant and Prince in bondage base and vile, And all the virtues of all ranks defile; Nor Learning's cloister'd shades withstood his power, Nor shrank he back abash'd from Beauty's smile, But durst, with steps profane, invade her bower, Reeling from revels gross, prolong'd for many an hour. XIX Then without shame on drawing-rooms' retreat, Whereto, ere wine grows wanton, dames retire, Would sots intrude, who scarce could keep their feet,â The drunken lord and doubly drunken squire, Their brains bewilder'd, and their blood on fire. Then felt the enamour'd youth, thro' hot excess, His bashful love transform'd to bold desire, And gazed upon his fair one's loveliness With looks from which she shrank as from a fiend's caress. XX Those days are past;âbut tho' at length expell'd From courtly halls, or there with chains fast bound, And wand reversed,âthe miscreant, yet unquell'd, In lowlier homes and meaner haunts is found, Still too triumphant upon British ground; Him taverns worship, him the alehouse owns Lord of each loathsome sight and bestial sound; Him the gin-palace in full state enthronesâ That charnel, fair without, but fill'd with dead men's bones. XXI And in the streets, at midnight, you may hear His votaries from their orgies staggering out, Flush'd high with brandy or ignoble beer, And roaming, like enfranchised fiends, about, With many a wanton song and deafening shout, Startling the sober citizen from sleep, Who haply opes his casement, and thereout At those mad revels doth affrighted peep, Which they, in frantic sport, right mischievously keep. XXII Then from obnoxious doors are knockers wrung, And pannels with incongruous paint o'erspread, And signs torn down, till watchmen's rattles sprung Sound to the charge, and soon some senseless head, Split by the official staff's congenial lead, Discloses to men's eyes its lack of brains; And one, self-rescued, staggers home to bed, And one, all night, in durance vile remains, Consign'd to watch-house baseâfit guerdon for his pains. XXIII These, Comus, are thy triumphsâbut alas! Not these aloneâah would that these were all! For thou all fiends in mischief dost surpass, Plague most accurst of this terrestrial ball! Health, fortune, reputation, conscience fall Beneath thy blasting spell;âalas for those Whom thou, with fatal witcheries, dost enthrall! No more shall they in peaceful homes repose, But waste in swift decay, pierced through with many woes. XXIV Theirs is the trembling hand, the pimpled cheek, The purple nose, the lean and shrunken limb, The bloated trunk, the gait infirm and weak, The palsied head, the eyeball blear'd and dim. Woe to the sot! yet not alone to him; Woe, woe to those whom once he held most dear!â His little ones a prey to famine grim, His wife left weeping in her chamber drear, Yet waiting his return with less of hope than fear. XXV Ah wretched she! more wretched for the peace Which once was hers, and which, when life was young, She fondly hoped with life alone should cease, When he upon her neck, enamour'd, hung, And vowed with winning and persuasive tongue, His life, himself, his body, soul and sense Hers until death;ânor were such pleasures flung At random from his lips in base pretence, But breathed in honest truth and frankest confidence. XXVI Nor lack'd their early years of wedded love The choicest pleasures which that state can yield, Until strong drink seduced his steps to rove From duty's path, and soon his bosom steel'd Against all power which Love and Hymen yield; For he of pious parents born and bred, His vows devoutly at the altar seal'd, And long the tenderest husband's life had led; Seem'd never mortal pair with brighter hopes to wed. XXVII And blessed was their basket and their store, For industry and honest thrift were theirs; And still they loved each other more and more, For that joint burden of parental cares Which grew and gather'd round them unawares As sons and daughters, year by year, were born,â Dear subjects of new hopes, and fears, and prayers; Alas that e'er such home should be forlorn, Or heart so fond as hers by such fierce anguish torn! XXVIII Sly was the fiend's approach;âin friendship's guise, And hand in hand with âAuld lang syneâ he came; And if the victim's heart, more warm than wise, Too freely open'd, few would harshly blame,â Few, in his place, but would have done the same. Yet there the first and fatal fault crept in, And at its heels came sorrow, guilt, and shame, Remorse in liquor quench'd, and deepening sin, So steep is Hell's descent when we to err begin! XXIX First tyrant Custom fill'd the dangerous cup In Friendship's name, and thus the alehouse dire Was, in his thoughts, with holier things mix'd up; Then, by degrees, insatiable desire Of that fell poison set his throat on fire, Weaning his heart from his pure peaceful home, Till, day by day, would he from work retire To that foul den, nor near his cottage come, Its pleasures now appear'd so tame and wearisome. XXX His home-spent hoursâah! wherefore flag they now? They flagg'd not when a life of toil he led, By daily sweat of his industrious brow Earning his wife's, his children's daily bread; And now by whom shall they be clothed and fed? What shelter shall they find from winter's cold? Alas for them!âfar better were they dead!â Their food withheldâtheir raiment pawn'd or sold,â Their mother sick and weak, for very grief grown old. XXXI No hope for her!âwith hard and ceaseless toil Early she labours, and but late takes rest; In vilest drudgery doth her beauty soil,â No murmur utter'd, no complaint express'd, Though wasting anguish is her daily guest; And still her needful food doth she forego, To calm their hunger whom she loveth best; And still, thro' wintry frost and driving snow, Ill shod and scantly clothed, to daily labour go. XXXII No hope for her!âscarce all her toil can win A scanty pittance of the coarsest bread; And when, sore spent, at evening, she comes in, Cowering she sits, and trembles, pale with dread, If she but hear her husband's coming tread, Lest he that pittance from her children tear, And barter it for drink;âtheir marriage-bed Long since was sold;âof table, stool, and chair, Yea all, save mouldering walls, her wretched hut is bare. XXXIII Cowering she sits beside her fireside hearth, Her children shivering in their straw with cold,â Till, with a sudden shout of brutal mirth, The crazy door is shatter'd, and behold! Him whom her youthful arms were wont to fold In tenderest transport, now, in drunken ire, Showering fierce blows and curses uncontroll'd On herâon her so long his heart's desire,â For whose dear sake he toil'd, with zeal which nought could tire. XXXIV No hope for her!âthe subtle fiend in him Hath done its perfect work, and he hath grown A reckless tyrant, sensual, sullen, grim; His heart, once flesh, is now transform'd to stone. Deaf is he to his famish'd children's moan, And if benigner death should set them free From life-long woes, would mock their dying groan With drunken shouts of most unnatural glee;â So lost to human loveâto human shame is he. XXXV No hope for her!âyes, one, she thinks, is leftâ O! if perchance in some long wished-for hour, When, not of sense and feeling quite bereft By dire intoxication's deadly power, He yet might ope his bosom to a shower Of loving words, kind looks, and gentle smiles, Still might she lead her lost one to a tower Of sure defence against temptation's wiles, And quell the enchanter curst who now his soul beguiles. XXXVI Oh! could she tempt him, by persuasion bland, To join this sober festival to-day, And see convivial pleasure hand in hand With peace domestic, chasing grief away, With sport, and dance, and jocund roundelayâ Or could she ope his sluggish ears to hear What that good man will in his lecture sayâ His better mind might yet unquench'd appear, And he, from guilt reclaim'd be more than ever dear. XXXVII But hark!âthe near church clock with sudden stroke Proclaims the long expected hour of one, And straight the tents are throng'd with hungry folk, And (grace first said) the banquet hath begun: Joints roast and boil'd, to nice perfection done, With multifarious garden-stuff combinedâ Plum-puddings which no epicure would shun, With thin potations of the choicest kindâ Furnish a feast at which Apicius might have dined. XXXVIII Nor lack we music to regale the ear, And keener relish to our meat impart, For brethren skill'd in minstrelsy are here, Each well-prepared, with willing hand and heart, In instrumental clang to bear his part;â Clarion and fife and double drum have we, And hautboy blown with no ignoble art; Hark! how attuned to blithe triumphant key, They breathe (what could they less?) the soul of social glee! XXXIX Brief is the meal, as Earth's best pleasures are; Few condiments the flagging taste provoke, No Bacchanalian toasts the banquet mar, For our unfetterr'd banqueters have broke The tyrant Custom's arbitrary yoke, And eat as hunger, drink as thirst impels; But hark! once more with swift, repeated stroke, The solemn music of the vesper bells The hour of public prayer, now fast approaching, tells. XL And at the signal, in procession long, Our men in office marshal their array, With trump and timbrel and low-murmur'd song, And parti-colour'd streamers bright and gay; âBrief compass fetch'dâthey crowd the queen's highway,â Aloft the Temperance banners are unroll'd, And emblems meet and mottoes quaint display, Emblazon'd with devices manifold, Which well, with quaking hearts, may publicans behold. XLI And now, defiling through the churchyard gate. The music hush'd at once, in order due, Within the church they crowd and congregate; Well fill'd ere long, I ween, is every pewâ With gazers all, with sneerers not a few: Meanwhile, the organ's deep, harmonious swell With notes prelusive gives the choir their cue, And they the Psalm intone which sings so well How sweet for brethren 'tis in unity to dwell. XLII And soon each heart is wrapt, or seems to be, In solemn worship by our pastor led;â Well with the occasion by strange chance agree The lessons in the daily service read;â âDestroy not him for whom Christ's blood was shed By meat and drink;âall things indeed are pure; Yet is it good e'en lawful meat to dread, Which makes a brother's walking insecure;â Thus saith St. Paul to day and what he saith is sure. XLIII âThe prayer concluded and the priest retired To doff the surplice and to don the gown,â Once more the choir, by tuneful zeal inspired, With choral hymn the solemn service crown; While rustic voices the full organ drown, Swelling from aisle and gallery, loud and clear. That hymn let us, who hearken, here set down, Albeit, uncouth and rugged it appear, And all unfit to please a critic's dainty ear. HYMN. 1 God of this fair creation! In whom we live and move; With hymns of adoration We own that Thou art love; Before thine altar kneeling Thy gracious name we bless For life, for health, for feeling, For all Earth's plenteousness. 2 For all that soothes our sorrows, And gives our sickness ease,â For corn that fills our furrows, For fruit that bends our trees,â For wine, its balm diffusing Through souls by pain opprest, Which use as not abusing,â O Lord, thy name be blest! 3 May food which nature needeth To us be daily given, While still the spirit feedeth On bread sent down from heaven! From streams by drought unwasted May we these draughts obtain, Which he who once hath tasted Shall never thirst again! XLIV And now, full arm'd for controversial fight, Yet more by mild persuasion bent to win, Our pastor climbs the pulpit's well-known height, And (prayer first duly utter'd,) doth begin With scripture phrase, well cull'd, to usher in His theme, repulsive to the public maw; Nor heeds the sneerer's ill-dissembled grin, Nor much of fair objectors stands in awe, So he may fence his cause with Heaven's expounded law. XLV Calmly he shows how Christian men should look Each to his neighbour's welfare as his own; How Paul himself permitted meat forsook, Lest brethren's souls thereby might be o'erthrown; Yet all harsh judgment strictly does disown Of those who use what God for use hath given; Deeming, in sooth, small sense or wisdom shown By those grim zealots of fanatic leaven, Who fain to all who taste would bar the gates of Heaven. XLVI âThe sermon endedâfrom the Church once more In proud procession moves the long array; Some haply not displeased that (service o'er) They as they list may now keep holiday; Again drums thunder, and loud trumpets bray, And now the tented lawn is throng'd apace With squire and peasant, lord and lady gay, Plebeian beauty and patrician grace; Was ne'er such motley crowd beheld in such a place. XLVII Within the tents again the festive board, But now with daintier fare, hath been supplied; Soul-cheering Tea, by fairest fingers pour'd, And piles of bread and butter, side by side With cakes which friends with liberal zeal provide; Around, domestic, happy groups appear,â Husband and wife, each now the other's pride, With children to both parents grown more dear; All former wrongs effaced, all grief forgotten here. XLVIII Elsewhere athletic youths, with strength adroit, In sports gymnastic sturdily contend; Some strike the quintain, and some hurl the quoit, Some, with firm grasp, the slippery rope ascend 'Midst favouring shout and laughter without end; And round the maypole, with bright garlands hung, Age, rank and sex, in circling dances blendâ Scholar and clownâthe aged and the young; Meanwhile, in lusty notes, is this blithe chorus sung. SONG. 1 Come brothers, be hearty! our Teetotal party Should surely the mirth of the alehouse outvie, Where sots o'er their liquor grow duller and sicker, And fools mimick fun with a drop in their eye. Better pleasures are oursâblue skies and green bowers, And merry tea-tables set out on the grass; With sunshine above us, and faces that love us, The wife with her husbandâthe lad with his lass. 2 Let blockheads too stupid for Hymen or Cupid To charm with a sweetheart or bless with a spouse, Their addle-brains muddle with publican's puddle, And drink themselves dumb in a sulky carouse. We've daughters and spouses, the joy of our houses, To share all our pleasures as blithely as we; In bumpers o'er-brimming, comeâhealth to the women! And thanks for their company!âdrink it in tea! 3 'Tis they who best cheer us, when sorrow comes near us, And would not their absence our revels condemn? Let's banquet like brothers, with sisters, wives, mothers,â Shame, shame on the churl who would feast without them! The brawls and brute quarrels which flow from beer barrels We leave to the slave of the bottle and bowl; No strife shall divide us, while they sit beside us, To smile on our frolics and yet to control. 4 Let sots in deep swilling who spend their last shilling, Lose food for the belly and clothes for the back; With coats all in tatters and puddingless platters, And health gone to ruin and home gone to rack. So end their carouses;âwe've peace in our houses, Glad smiles to receive us, and family glee; So a fig for ale-bottles!âlet tee-total throttles Shout Glory for ever to Temperance Tea! XLIX But daylight waneth, and our sports must end, For moderation best befits the wise; Nor would our brethren by excess offend Foes who malign or friends who patronize; Anon, at signal sounded, all arise; Tent, maypole, quintain are deserted straight, And soon upon the ear the music dies, Even the last straggler follows through the gate, And all is silence now, where all was mirth so late. L Is all then o'er?âand shall our revel fade E'en like a dream, and leave no trace behind? Nay, yet one final effort must be made To shake the stubborn, fix the wavering mind, And weak resolve by strengthening pledge to bind. Lo! where to yonder schoolroom crowds repair Each on the alert to gain the foremost place, For one well-known to-night will lecture there; And now the room is full;âour pastor takes the chair. LI At first some meaner orators, with speech Simple and rude, the attentive crowd address; Themselves reclaim'd, would fain their brethren teach How small indulgence leads to sure excess; And many a homely tale, as you may guess, They tell, and many a pungent jest essay, Mocking each phase of filthy drunkenness, The alehouse gabble and the tipsy fray, The pains and sickness dire which topers feel next day. LII âSomewhat too much of thisâbut now 'tis past;â A murmur of impatience, quickly heard, Dies into silence;âlo! he comes at last, The speaker to all speakers far preferr'd:â He rises, but, or ere he speaks a word, The echoing walls with loud applause are rent; One cheer has sunk,âa secondâthen a third Rise, roar, and fallâtill all their breath have spent, And hang upon his words with eager looks intent. LIII A noticeable man is he, with brow High and projecting, and of broad expanse, Plough'd, by long thought, in deepening furrows now, As past life's middle stage his years advance; From his benign and manly countenance Intelligence and mild good-humour beam; Around the room he casts one kindling glance, And straight, when hush'd and still the hearers seem, Lets loose his deep-toned voice in full, continuous stream. LIV At first, in gentlest phrase, with utterance low, And half, it seems, in earnest, half in jest, He courts attention both from friend and foe, And lays unwilling prejudice to rest, Which else with rude disturbance might molest His after speech; and now some tale he tells, Now on some caustic apologue, express'd With dry, grave humour, for a moment dwells, Till, roused by its own rush, the soul within him swells. LV Anon, in fearful colours, he portrays The drunkard's headlong course of sin and shame,â His short and bitter term of evil days,â His frantic joys unworthy of the name,â His children beggar'd, or of ruin'd fameâ To guilty deeds by grinding hunger driven,â Yet he in heart and conduct still the same,â His every hope long lost in Earth and Heaven, For how should slave so curst repent and be forgiven? LVI In vigorous contrast he exhibits next The abstainer's blameless life and blissful lot; His days of peaceful industry, unvex'd By guilt or fear,âhis clean, well-furnish'd cot,â The plenteous meal, well dress'd and smoking hot,â The jocund circle round his evening fire,â His marriage-vow unstain'd by speck or blot, But bless'd by mutual love and chaste desire, And sweet domestic joys too pure to fade or tire. LVII Nor ends the contrast with expiring Time;â Eternity's dark veil is rent in twain, And lo! the direful fruit of sensual crime! The deep damnationâthe immortal pain In which the drunkard must for aye remain! The fire unquench'd!âthe worm which never dies! And Heaven discern'd far off distinct and plain, Throng'd with the spirits of the just, who rise From death's sepulchral sleep to reign above the skies! LVIII âNow look on these twin pictures, ye who doubt, And choose,â quoth he, âthe better while ye may; Beware lest appetite drive reason out, Or rash indulgence Heaven's whole bliss betray; Now, in the sunshine of your mortal day, By strong resolve the insidious Tempter shun, Cast from your lips the dangerous cup away, And half life's battle is already won, And half its direst troubles ended ere begun. LIX âStrong is the magic of our Temperance pledge, The pledge of brethren against evil bound, Fencing, with an impenetrable hedge, Each weak and wavering brother round and round; Sole aid against the spells of Bacchus found,â Religion's handmaid, Virtue's friend secure,â Extirpator of vice from British ground,â Firm aid of all things lovely, good, and pure,â Heaven's instrument it seems, all social ills to cure. LX âOnce bound and circled in its mystic chain, The timid become bold, the feeble strong, The self-indulgent can, thenceforth, refrain From sinful pleasure, loved and cherish'd long: Man's tyranny and woman's bitter wrong Its potent influence quickly doth allay; And, where 'tis kept, domestic pleasures throng, And social joyance makes all faces gay;â Witness the mirthful crowds assembled here to-day!â LXI Our festival is o'er;âthe crowds disperse, And silence dwells in the deserted room; A few remain, who from the avenging curse, And all the dreadful depths of guilt and gloom, To which intemperance doth her victims doom, Would, in that vaunted pledge, safe shelter find. For such let Earth's least fading garlands bloom,â Love, joy, and peace, from sensual dross refined;â And theirs be vigorous health of body and of mind! LXII Nor need our pastor grieve with vain regret, Tho' he no more the inspiring glass should drain, His throat no more with port or sherry wet,â No more his lips, at costlier tables, stain With ruddy claret or the pink champagne: In sooth, such draughts were never sweet to him; Better he loves the juice of British grainâ The porter, foaming o'er the tankard's brimâ The ale, whose dazzling gleam makes e'en the topaz dim. LXIII Nor thankless he, of old, for cyder press'd From the rich growth of Worcester's fruitful shire; Nor scorn'd on Sunday evenings, when at rest From pulpit toils (for pulpit toils will tire) With wine and egg, commingled o'er the fire, His drooping strength and spirits to restore,â Well pleased to think the body might require Such aid;âthese thoughts are, for the present, o'er, And he, on thinnest drinks, grows lustier than before. LXIV And if, ere long, by sore experience taught, That which he now upholds he must oppose, 'Twill yet to him be no unpleasant thought, That vice and he were here, as ever, foes. But, for the present, thus our song we close,â For hark! the urn is hissing, and the tea In fragrant streams for our regalement flows,â While Fanny's voice, in clear, melodious key, Warbles prelusive strains of choicest minstrelsy. PART II. ALTARS, HEARTHS, AND GRAVES. ALICE GAY'S BRIDAL. With loud, tumultuous clash and clang, As though with sudden rapture mad, Twelve bells congratulation rang, From that stout belfry of St. Chad: The rite was o'er, the love-knot tied, And down the aisle, in trim array, The bridemaids follow'd, thoughtful-eyed, Their wedded sister, Alice Gay. The vestry walls had ears within For many an old-establish'd jest; By many a lip of friends and kin The bride's consenting lips were press'd: And (all things done in order meet) Again the fair procession pass'd Through gazing crowds which lined the street, And gain'd the festive home at last. But there flock'd in a gathering host Of neighboursâsome esteem'd through life; The friend since youth beloved the most, The college crony with his wife, The school companion of the bride, The bridegroom's chum of yesterday, All came to grace in pomp and pride The nuptial feast of Alice Gay. Yet mirth came not;âo'er old and young, Kinsfolk and friends assembled there, A smile-o'er casting shadow hung,â A cloudy consciousness of care; And though the board was richly spread, And wine its cheering influence lent, It might on every brow be read That 'twas no time for merriment. The bride had still that anxious mien Which all the previous day she wore; At wedding feast was seldom seen A sadder, sweeter face before: Her father strove with laugh and jest The deep heart-trouble to disguise Which yet his faltering tones express'd, Which glimmer'd in his misty eyes. I rose (the chaplain of the day) Obedient to maternal sign, âA few appropriate wordsâ to say, And pledge the parting pair in wine; And half in earnest, half in joke, In bantering, serio-comic style, Essay'd a speech which should provoke, If not a laugh, at least a smile. But when the laugh was fairly laugh'd, And other friends had said their say, And toasts been cheer'd and bumpers quaff'd, And changes rung on âgrave and gay,â And, after many a last embrace, And parting words said o'er and o'er, The bride had turn'd her tearful face From that dear homeâher home no more;â While bridemaids doff'd their raiment gay, And bridemen donn'd their boating gear, To wile the lagging hours away On Severn's current brisk and clear,â We elders in the house alone Were left, o'er teeming thoughts to brood, And I held converse with my own In somewhat of despondent mood. I saw, as in a wizard's glass, The generations of our kin Arise and flourish, fade and pass, Old interests end and new begin; I saw the frequent silver streak Now turning ebon ringlets grey, Which shaded once the blooming cheek Of bride as fair as Alice Gay. I thought how much of life was past, How little of its duty done; How friends had dropp'd around us fast, And still were dropping one by one; How we ourselves seem'd scarcely more Than laggards of a troop gone by, Whose hopes and fears on earth were o'er,â Whose proper task was now to die. I thoughtâah! sisters, ye can think, How homes and haunts which serv'd for years, The present with the past to link, In love which fill'd the eyes with tears,â The halls in which our kinsmen dwelt,â The old town house,âthe vicarage small,â Hard by the church in which we knelt As children,âare deserted all. And how of ten who used to play, Long since, around our parents' knees, Four only are alive to-day, And one a wanderer even of these. With fortune and the world at strife, He roams the wild Australian shore, An alien now from English life, An heir of English hope no more. Or e'er upon our native soil, We three lay down our load of years, And cast aside this mortal coil, With earth's last troubles, hopes, and fears, 'Tis meet we closer draw the chain Which Nature round our spirits wove, And cheer the days which yet remain With fuller intercourse of love. Our children (God hath blest us all,â Best blessing in the stores of time,â With sons and daughters great and small, From infancy to manhood's prime,)â Our children sure should not be strange, Or unfamiliar each with each, But give and take in free exchange What heart to kindred heart can teach. Thanks to the world-embracing rail! No distance of terrestrial span, Can now, as heretofore avail, To bar congenial man from man. O'er Britain hand to hand can reach, All eyes all faces may behold, And tongues exchange familiar speech, Where only spirits could of old. Those twain abodes by Severn's side, To us have household thoughts become; So few the hours which now divide Your western from our midland home. For what remains of mortal life, Nought hinders that henceforth we be, Child, father, sister, husband, wife, All fused in one great family. Meanwhile behold a homely gift, A sample of the thoughts which flow, The fancies quaint which change and shift, As whim directs them, to and fro,â The graver musings sometimes bred, Amidst the controversial strife, And pastoral toil of heart and head, Which fill my later half of life: In sooth such trifles suit but ill The work which hath been mine since youth; The rhymer's light, fantastic skill But mars the solid ore of truth; And we who strive with death and sin, In ceaseless, never-ending fight, But rarely time or taste can win For fancy's dreams of vain delight. Yet like the fitful breeze which sweeps In gusts across Ãolian strings, And wakes the soul that in them sleeps, Too deep for Art's solicitingsâ From time to time an impulse caught, I know not whence, I know not how, Awakes the slumbering soul of thought, And breathes it into verse, as now. Nor few the springs of song which well Beside the pastor's path in life; No dweller he in monkish cell, But rich in children, home, and wife. Now praying in the poor man's cot, Now wrestling with the Romish lie, Now solacing the mourner's lot, Now teaching timid hearts to die. He lives with men, himself a man, A husband and a parent, knows, As none but those who learn it can, The lore of household joys and woes: His soul, a human soul, is fed On food which kindred natures crave; On him their threefold influence shed The hearth, the altar, and the grave. What marvel, if in leisure hours, When failing health solicits ease, He feel the stir of dormant powers, Awaking to such themes as these? What blame, if out of these he twine A rainbow-tinted wreath of lays, Exhaling faintly, line by line, The fragrance of his fading days? What crime, if he would thus bequeathe, To flock and fold, to friends and kin, Some record of the thoughts that seethe A pastor-poet's breast within; And when his place is void on earth, To children's children still declare What tomb and temple, home and hearth, To those who went before them were? Again we met beside the sea, And bride and bridegroom join'd us there; In all the world could scarcely be A calmer, yet a happier pair. A month its due effect had wrought On either heart, and hope and fear, And joy and grief, and anxious thought, Were merged in love profoundly dear. A cheerful party were we now,â The bridegroom had grown sober-eyed, And whoso look'd upon her brow Might read contentment in the bride: We wander'd on the wild sea shore, We breathed the breezes pure and free,â The breezes which so oft restore Departed health and strength to me. They cameâthey wentâthat youthful pair,â The husband to his flockâthe wife With woman's love to soothe and share The labours of a pastor's life; And Iâwhat less could poet give Than this to speed them on their way, And bring to mind, while both shall live, The Honey Moon of Alice Gay? THE SONG OF THE CHURCH-BUILDERS. I Where, with sounds of toil and wonder, Engines roar and axles roll; Where convergent railways thunder Hourly to their central goal; Where, from distant vale and highland, To and fro are sent and brought, O'er this broad imperial Island, Trade and travel, wealth and thought; II Where our English youth inherit, From remote ancestral days, Nurture meet for mind and spirit, Guidance sure in wisdom's ways; Where, in strife with sore temptations, Wrong'd, mis-judged, reviled, belied, (Name beloved, revered by nations!) Arnold battled, taught, and died; III Where the giant sons of labour Gathering, swarming, work, and wive, Neighbour pressing close on neighbour, In their huge, still widening hive; Where, in haste which never endeth, Mammon on his path doth plod; There a cry to Heaven ascendethâ âBuild, oh build, the House of God.â IV Who shall help to bear the burden? Who shall help the strife to win,â (Strifeâits own abundant guerdon,) With the powers of Death and Sin? Parents, children, wives and mothers, Rich and poor, and young and old,â Spend, be spent for friends and brothers,â For the flock prepare the fold. V Men of wealth, whose gold proceedeth From the hordes which labour here, Grant, to every soul that needeth, Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer: Give the toil-worn heart, which yearneth For its hour of sabbath rest, Leave to greet the light which burneth Brightly for the weary breast. VI Christian servantsâChristian masters, Tradesman and apprentice, come; Heal the stricken soul's disasters, Give the wandering heart a home: Let none faint, draw back, or falter, Now the struggle hath begun; Till, from God's completed Altar, Sounds a voice, âYour work is done.â VII Well! O brothers! well already,â Well! O sisters! ye have wrought; Still be patient, firm and steady, One in heart, and will, and thought Still, with keen unwavering vision, Keep the nearing goal in view Still, with prompt resolved decision, Each the general prize pursue. VIII Urge, enforce your proud petition,â East and west, and south and north, Speed your couriers on their mission, Send your rousing summons forth: Hearts there be in every quarter, Which our Town's dear name shall stir; Sons alert earth's wealth to barter, For the lore they learn'd of Her. IX Ye whose youthful footsteps wander'd By our wizard Fabulosus Amnis.âShakspere's Avon.Avon's side; Ye whose hearts first mused and ponder'd Here, on thoughts whose fruits abide; Ye to whom each slope and valley, Lane and meadow far aroundâ Ye to whom each nook and alley Of our streets is holy ground!â X Ye to whom old days returning, In your sons, almost restore Hopes with which your hearts were burning Ere sad manhood's yoke ye bore; For the priceless lore imparted, For the nurture which doth train Here your young and guileless-heartedâ Pay us now in kind again. XI Ye who still are fondly ranging Through your embryo world of thought, Bright with hues each moment changing, Teeming still with joys unsought; Ye whom learning, art and science, Tempt, encourage, urge, invite, Here with manifold appliance, To true wisdom's pure delight; XII Ye whose barks, not yet in motion,â Ye whose sails, not yet unfurl'd,â Float at rest upon the ocean Of this wide tempestuous world; Ye whose sports are still your labours,â Ye who know not care nor woe,â O'er the souls of thirsting neighbours Help the stream of life to flow. XIII Ye whom deeper draughts of knowledge Strengthen in your May of youth, Still in cloister'd court and college Seeking self-revealing Truth; Think what Her pursuit hath made you, Think in Her what others lack; As your school-day tasks still aid you, Aid, as Christians, send us back. XIV Dwellers in old haunts of learning,â Ye who once from Arnold heard Thoughts for which your hearts were yearning,â Thoughts for which their depths were stirr'd; Where great Alfred's shade reposeth,â Where meek Henry's name is blest,â Where sepulchral darkness closeth O'er the Bard's and Statesman's rest;â XV Ye who near Sabrina's waters,â On her steeple-crested shore, (âLoveliest she of Learning's daughters!â) Train young hearts in healthiest lore;â Hear a sister's voice appealing,â Hear her children, how they plead; Send her gracious help and healing In her straitness and her need. XVI By the thoughts which haunt and trouble, In your courts, the good and wise; By the tears they cause to bubble Oft and oft to aged eyes; By the strong enchantment breathing From your old ancestral towers; By the magic folds enwreathing Gentle hearts, both yours and ours;â XVII Now, while murkiest clouds combining Brood o'er Learning's midland home;â While, her deep foundations mining, Creep the pioneers of Rome;â While the shots begin to rattle,â While on our unwavering van Bursts the onset of the battleâ Hear us, help us, ye who can! XVIII Here, where Thought's fresh fountains glisten In the ingenuous eye of Youth; Where pure spirits love to listen To the voice of ancient Truth; Here, where Travel's paths are centred,â Here, where Trade hath fixed her throne,â Rome's insidious hosts have enter'd, Rome's pernicious seed is sown. XIX Here the wily Jesuit lurketh,â Here the Monk hath built his cell; Here the meek-eyed Sister worketh For the Church she loves so well; Here (O thought of shame and sorrow!) Foes, once friends, our peace invade; Tenfold strength false Rome doth borrow From the enthusiast renegade. XX Garbs uncouth, ill-boding faces, Through our streets like spectres steal; Men who ne'er a child's embraces Ne'er a father's love must feel; Gaunt of form and grim of feature, Barr'd from all that God hath given Here to bless his noblest creatureâ Phantoms not of Earthânor Heaven. XXI These!âare these thy foes, O Britain? This the host thy sons must dread? Must thy life of life be smitten In such combat with the dead? Joy were thine, O queenly nation, Lurk'd no deadlier peril near; Had thy coming generation No more desperate strife to fear! XXII These, at least, are half our brothers,â Brothers, tho' of creed outworn; Now of mischief's myriad mothers Creedless foes are hourly born: Hosts in darkness grow and gather, Foes to altar, hearth, and throne; Foes who know no Heavenly Father, No Divine Redeemer own. XXIII Sounds of dread begin to mutter Harshly to the initiate ear; Tongues obscene find strength to utter Boding sounds of rage and fear: On the thin and narrowing border Of debate and peace we stand; Waiting till full-grown disorder Burst in fury on the land. XXIV Still, thou proud and palmy nation, Undisturb'd thy state appears; Still thy gaze of expectation Beameth on the coming years: Still thou cleav'st, of change abhorrent, To establish'd rule and form;â Smoothest stream!âto swell the torrent! Breathless hush!âto break in storm! XXV Deep within thy breast is seething Many a form of social ill; Many a soul, in secret breathing Rage and hate, lies close and still; Through thy frame with strange sensation Shiverings chill begin to creep; Dreams of feverish agitation Vex thee in thy troubled sleep. XXVI Godless hordes, untaught, neglected, Writhing in their want and pain,â Unappeased and unprotected,â Fierce of heart and wild of brain,â Scarce even now their rage can smother,â Blind with hate, with suffering grim, Curse their unacknowledged mother,â Burn to rend her limb from limb. XXVII From the fields, by toil which grovels Abject, hopeless, reaped and sown; From the tottering huts and hovels Thronged by forms of skin and bone; From the vast o'er-peopled city, Whence tall chimnies pierce the skies,â Where pale crowds, unknown to pity, Late take rest and early rise;â XXVIII From the subteranean cavern, Where weak infants toil and pine; From the tap-room and the tavern, Where their wrathful sires combine,â Swells the cry of hearts that languish,â Hearts that shall ere long rebel; Smokes the fire of human anguish Kindled by the breath of hell. XXIX Still, thy face is bland and smiling, Still thy words with grace abound; Nought defiled, and nought defiling, May in thy saloons be found: Guides thou hast, whom all must follow,â Doubt, near them, must hide its head; Yet are half thy seemings hollow,â Yet is half thy spirit dead. XXX Foul eruptive superstitions, Flushing o'er thy tainted skin, Mock, elude thy vain physicians,â Shew disease uncheck'd within: Not, O Britain, not for ever, Can thy specious mockeries last; Soon must blaze the latent fever, Soon thy seeming health be past. XXXI Soon, in earthquake, flame and thunder, Shall the fire, which smouldering lies, Burst the hollow crust asunder Of thy prim hypocrisies: Then, when friends and foes are parted, Shall the day of trial tell Who are true, and who false-hearted, Who for Heaven, and who for Hell. XXXII Pent till now in earth's recesses Forms Titanic stir and rise, Cursing all the Saviour blesses, Spurning all His people prize: Face to face stand Good and Evil, For their last great conflict ranged; Earth with Hell, and Man with Devil, Man from God too long estranged! XXXIII Lo! the creeds of ages crumble! Lo! on earth's upheaving crust, Tower and temple reel and tumble, Throne and empire turn to dust! Hollow is the ground we tread on, Prince and people, Church and priest; Lo! the day of Armageddon Dawneth in the louring east. XXXIV Ere, for this world's last dominion, Host with host in combat close; Ere the vulture flap her pinion O'er expiring heaps of foes; Once again, O brothers, rally,â 'Midst desertion, treachery, loss, Undismay'dâo'er hill and valley Wave the banner of the Cross. XXXV Faithful bands shall yet assemble, When your gathering note is heard; Yet the host of Hell shall tremble At the thunders of the Word: Yetâwhile dire convulsion rages Ceaselessly from land to land,â Founded on the Rock of Ages Shall the Church unshaken stand. XXXVI Yetâwhile madly through the nations Sweeps the flood of hate and fear; She, with gentlest ministrations, Shall her children's spirits cheer; From the strife of vain opinions, From the rush of error's blast, Shield them with her sheltering pinions, Till the storm be overpast. XXXVII Still, where'er her honour'd steeple Points to Heaven from holy ground, Shall a brave and righteous people Faithful to its God be found: Still shall bow before His Altar Vigorous knee and hoary head; Still by lips which lisp and falter Shall his Holy Book be read. XXXVIII Still from hearths of humble gladness, Still from homes by wealth despised, Where, alike in joy and sadness, Wisdom's word is known and prized,â From the plough, the loom, the spindle, Prayer and praise shall oft ascend; Hearts with grateful love shall kindle Towards their Heavenly King and Friend. XXXIX Still shall flames of pure devotion, Kindled first at English hearth, Spread their blaze o'er sea and ocean, To the extremest verge of earth: Still, where wife, and child, and father Seek new homes on heathen ground, There shall Christian Churches gather, There shall Christian faith be found. XL Haste then, lay the strong foundationâ Haste, the choicer work prepare; Friends of every rank and station, Each the toilâthe blessing share: Each his separate service render, Each his willing aid afford; Till in grave majestic splendour Stands the Temple of the Lord. XLI Spacious aisle, and chancel solemn, Window stain'd with rare device, Graceful arch and shapely column, Fretwork quaint of costliest price;â All that doth God's worship honourâ All that doth Man's heart impressâ All that doth the liberal donor In his late remembrance bless,â XLII Make the Mansion rich and beauteous, Which for God on earth we build; There may hearts devout and duteous With His present grace be fill'd! Haste, hew timber, stone and marble, Grasp the trowel, pile the hod; While with heart and voice we warble âBuild! O Build! the House of God.â PENTECOSTAL ODE. 1852. On Laying the First Stone of the Church of the Holy Trinity, Rugby. I No sign, in earth or sky, Proclaim'd that Spring was night,â Nor genial warmth, nor mild, refreshing showers; But winter's hoar-frost lay, At break and close of day, On fields which should have blazed with vernal flowers; And stars of frosty splendour, clear and bright, Kept watch in April skies as through December's night. II Through bare and leafless trees The keen, cold Eastern breeze Shrill'd as it swept;âno aromatic gale, Wafting to Western sense Luxurious bliss intense Of perfume which Arabian blooms exhale; But chill and wintry as the gust which raves O'er Scythia's ice-bound rocks, through bleak Siberian caves. III Beneath that withering blast As o'er our land it pass'd, Nature lay bound, as by an hideous spell; Her deep maternal womb Inclosed, as in a tomb, The life which vainly strove to burst its shell; The sun his procreative power forgot, [not. And kiss'd the earth with rays which cheer'd but quicken'd IV Then seem'd some strange divorce Launch'd with dissevering force, To break the nuptial bond of Earth and Heaven; And, like some wife abhorr'd Of her offended lord, Who leads her life alone and unforgiven, Earth, with an evil and unnatural eye, Scowl'd on her born, and curs'd her unborn progeny. V Verdure had left the grass,â The skies above were brass, The soil in dust arose beneath the tread; Below his reedy bank The streamless river shrank, As when late summer droughts lay bare his bed. Nor human life, nor bestial might endure, Unharm'd the laggard year's so long distemperature. VI But from the juiceless mead The lean and hungry steed Cropp'd his scant meal;âthe melancholy kine, In dull and languid mood, For their expected food Withheld, in silent suffering seem'd to pine; The mated birds cower'd close within the nest, No insect of the Spring display'd his broider'd vest. VII And still, as weeks wore past, The Farmer stood aghast To mark his wasting stock;âaround a fire As of the Christmas hearthâ Not now in Christmas mirthâ Crowded at evening, mother, child, and sire; Thence watched the sunset of the vernal skies, And saw the long day close, the clear, cold stars arise. VIII Stricken was human life, And strange diseases rife;â O! when, long-look'd-for Spring, wilt thou appear? When shall thy fresh rains fallâ Thy sunshine disenthrall From frost and fog this tainted atmosphere? When from this trance, wherein spell-bound it lies, Shall Nature's dormant life, by thee regenerate, rise? IX Thus, from its depths profound, With inarticulate sound Of murmur'd prayer, or mute, impatient sigh, Man's spirit made its moan,â All creatures seem'd to groan And travail for release which none felt nigh; But each in dumb, expectant anguish lay, Till heaven's mild face restored should smile its pangs away. X At lengthâa welcome guestâ From out the sweet South-west, Breathing faint perfume, and from dewy wing Dispensing balmy showers On grass and trees and flowers, A breeze came forth,âthe Spirit of the Spring; Whereby all Nature, to her centre stirr'd, The well-known influence felt, the well-known music heard. XI A deep, heart-lightening throbâ A stifled sighâa sob Of pleasure, too profound to be repress'd, Thrill'd through the soul of earth,â The heavens, in tearful mirth Of trickling rains, their sympathy confess'd; A spell was broken, whose incumbent weight Had press'd all living things and things inanimate. XII And though not yet the skies Discharge their full supplies, Nor empty quite their half-inverted urn,â And oft, at morn and night, Chill frosts untimely bite, And bleak, inclement winds by day return,â Nature no longer droops, but lifts to Heaven A calm, expectant eye, like one who feels forgiven. XIII Now hearts expand with joy,â Maid, matron, man and boy With smiles and songs pursue their work or play; Insect, and bird, and brute, Plant, flower, and blossom'd fruit Inhale at last the genuine breath of May; And every hour do water, air and earth To countless shoals and swarms of blissful life give birth. XIV Here let the spirit pause;â Hence to the Great First Cause Of all created goodâall lifeâall blissâ Uplift adoring thought,â By things external taught The mysteries of a mightier world than this;â That unseen world within us, yet beyond, Whereto doth Nature's course obscurely correspond. XV Hath not the heart of man, Within its separate span, Seed-time and harvestâcold or genial spring,â Summer and autumn heat, And winter frost and sleet,â All good and ill which varying seasons bring? Yearneth it not for heavenly warmth and light, When streams of grace run dry, and mists of error blight? XVI And when, from realms above, Warm rays of truth and love The frost of Nature's wintry season melt, And Heaven's resistless breath Hath burst that trance of death In which the spell-bound soul nor moved nor felt,â And fertilizing rains of grace descend, And light and genial heat commingled influence blend,â XVII Then doth the new-born soul, Set free from sin's controul, Blossom and bourgeon in celestial spring; Then from the teeming heart Divine affections start, [wing: And heavenward thoughts, like new-fledged birds, take Light to the spirit's inmost depths hath shone,â Its summer is at hand, its winter past and gone. XVIII Such fruit of wish'd-for May The Church doth now display, Who late, a mourner lone, afflictive Lent Kept with despondent cheer, And frequent sigh and tear, Wailing her absent Lord in low lament; And when the bars of his sepulchral prison He brake, could scarce believe that He indeed was risen. XIX And still, while He on earth Consoled her spirit's dearth, Or e'er the promised Comforter was given,â Uncheer'd her bitter cup She drain'd, till He went up To claim his throne at God's right hand in Heaven: Nor yet had dawn'd her Pentecostal morn, But still she wail'd and wept in widow'd state forlorn. XX But hark! her ear at last Hath caught the rising blast As of a rushing mighty whirlwind's sound;â Around her brows a tiar, Begemm'd with tongues of fire, Circles and shines:âThe King his Bride hath crown'd. Conduct her, virgins, to her throne of state; The Queen her realm hath won,âthe widow'd found her Mate. XXI Now spread the nuptial board, And be rich offerings pour'd, In liberal joy, at Bride and Bridegroom's feet All loyal hearts dispense Ambrosial frankincense Of prayer and praise, while, in profusion meet, Silver and gold are to the Temple given, To grace the marriage feast of Earth redeem'd and Heaven. XXII Father! to thee we pray, Inspire our hearts to-day With faith unfeign'd and heavenly love sincere; And seal this fane thine own, Whose first foundation-stone We lay with solemn pomp of ritual here: First step of one tall ladder which shall rise, For men's and angels' tread, between the earth and skies. XXIII O! if this sacred spot Thy presence hallow not,â If on this work thy Spirit be not shed,â Around it and beside Will circle far, and wide, A populous waste,âa city of the dead,â A realm of souls shut out from heavenly light, Born but at Mammon's beck to toil from morn till night. XXIV Lo! from the vale beneath Floats up a sulphurous wreath Of vapour from the furnace and the flood, Whose gnomes their strength combine With genii of the mine, To compass feats too vast for flesh and blood:â Swart giants, whose joint ministry alone Can work the will of wealth which hath all bounds outgrown. XXV And from that point expand, As by Enchanter's wand From the deep bowels of the earth call'd forth, Vast piles, in many a range, Of form uncouth and strange, Far stretching East and West, and South and North; Within whose spacious courts the Titan, Steam, O'er hordes of human vassals holds his state supreme. XXVI There their colossal might Conflicting powers unite; Water and flame;âthere iron, wing'd with gold, In swift, impetuous race, Contends with time and space; There human nerve and bone are bought and sold; And human souls their high ethereal birth Forget in drudgery vile, all earthy and of earth. XXVII Not vain the lesson taught To calm discerning thought By that grim region, in its might display'd; A type of science throned, And nobler lore disown'd,â Of thought laid prostrate at the feet of trade;â Of low and sensual aims pursued with zeal, Which none, in this late age, for mind's true glories feel. XXVIII There sits the Ocean Queen, As in a mirror seen, In pride full blown of her commercial state; Potent to wield at will, Alike for good and ill, All powers that on the beck of Mammon wait; With luxuries rich and costly compass'd round, Deck'd with all gorgeous gems in earth's wide circle found. XXIX Beneath the cope of Heaven, To Her all power is given O'er brute mechanic forces;âwind and wave, Tamed by her strong controul, Transport from pole to pole Her priceless freights:âthe lightning is her slave, And bears her queenly mandates to and fro, And at her high behest doth meekly come and go. XXX To swell her peerless might Shrewdness and force unite; Counsel to plan, and energy to will; Calm forethought, prudence cool, Strength train'd in freedom's school, And valour, by experience lesson'd still: All worlds might she subdue in easy strife, Were meat and raiment more than body and than life. XXXI But Truth Supreme saysâNo! Earth was not moulded so,â Not so of old were Heaven's foundations laid, That skill and strength of men, As from a Cyclop's den, Should bind in fetters, which their toil hath made, The everlasting course of things create, And reign, with iron will, o'er all the realm of Fate. XXXII The powers that chain the wind, The lightning's pinions bind, Yoke fire and flood to their triumphal car,â Are but the servile thrall Of Mind enthroned o'er all, And Mind, in turn, a weak and wavering star, Itself opaque, dispensing but a beam Reflected from the sun of heavenly truth supreme. XXXIII And where that beam is veil'd, Or its pure light hath fail'd, In vain the forge-fires glowâthe anvils ring; In vain the Cyclop's crew With stroke and shout renew The task exacted by their grisly king: Nought will their strength produce, by all its toil, But anarchy and wrong and mischief's mad turmoil. XXXIV Meanwhile unheard, above, Wisdom and Truth and Love Discourse celestial music, clear and sweet; Apollo strikes the lyre, The Muses' answering choir Their high accordant harmonies repeat; Which hush'd Olympus holds its breath to hear, While dull is Britain's heart, and deaf is Britain's ear. XXXV Yet till that heavenly strain Can touch the heart and brain Swoln with Earth's pride, and drunk with carnal power, No might can disenthral Slaves, doom'd to crouch and crawl, From sensual bonds which the soul's life devour: O'er their crush'd strength incumbent Ãtna lies,â Blindly they heave and turn, and strive in vain to rise. XXXVI Awake! ye faithful few, Whose souls, devout and true, Still hold serene communion with the skies; Who still, with aim sublime, Above this grovelling time, Above these numbing bonds of custom rise; Whom neither lust enslaves, nor avarice blinds, Nor Duty's trumpet-call unnerved for action finds. XXXVII To you, in still retreat, Or high Devotion's seat,â To you, amidst your toils of Christian love,â Far from the din and strife Of this world's restless life, Came the strong cry of kindred hearts which strove In one high cause with you;âthat cry ye heard, And to your spirit's depths were by its summons stirr'd. XXXVIII And lo! with one accord, To Heaven's eternal Lord Our joint fraternal gift we bring to-day; And hopefully combine, Of His intended shrine The strong and sure foundation-stone to lay; Whereto shall streams of Christian pilgrims flow, While Mammon's shapeless pile attracts its crowds below. XXXIX That shapeless pile to rear, Pours in from far and near, Exhaustless gold;âwell loves the world its own, And grudges not to gild The fane its children build To their blind god, or deck his gaudy throne. Meanwhile, with slow laborious toil, we wring, From few but Christian hearts, what here to Heaven we bring. XL Yet with no niggard thrift Dishonour we the gift, But, strong in faith, our costly work begin; Though circling years should flee, And still our children see The maim'd, imperfect pile rebuke their sin; And still, below, the trains should thunder by, Nor spire, discern'd from far, delight the traveller's eye. XLI Deep buried in the tomb Of the veil'd Future's womb Leave we such thoughts;âthe present time is ours; And, ere its sand be run, Must we the work have done Allotted to its few and fleeting hours. Let zeal complete what faith and hope have plann'd, For lo! the night when no man worketh is at hand. XLII Stake out the appointed ground, And closely fence it round; Dig the foundation deep; securely lay, Within the green earth's breast, The stones whereon must rest The ponderous pile which we commence to-day;â That work may prophets and apostles own, And Jesus Christ Himself be the chief Corner Stone! XLIII Here shall, in after days, The chaunt of prayer and praise To Heaven's high throne in choral anthems mount; Here on the good and true Descend celestial dew From the pure depths of Love's exhaustless fount; Here shall the bread of life the hungry feed,â Here in the faithful heart be sown the heavenly seed. XLIV Here, where of late the flowers, Refresh'd by vernal showers, Spread their gay petals to the fostering sun, Ere long more heavenly rain Shall wash ancestral stain From that unconscious life scarce yet begun; While Christian parents their full hearts uplift To Him who, then and there, confirms his promis'd gift. XLV And where the hawthorn hedge Now skirts the Eastern edge Of the allotted ground, the altar rail That mystic space shall fence Whence holy hands dispense The heavenly manna which shall never fail. There shall pure hearts their present Lord adore, And with His flesh and blood their fainting strength restore. XLVI And there their plighted troth Shall bride and bridegroom both With God's own sanction ratify and seal; There learn that earthly love Hath its deep springs above, As, side by side, before their Lord they kneel; A holier love, profounder and more true Than e'er ascetic monk or cloister'd abbess knew. XLVII Nor pass we lightly by, With heedless heart and eye, The spot whereon hereafter shall be read The pure and living word, By saint or sinner heard, With joy or grief, with hope or anxious dread; Nor that, wherefrom the preacher's voice shall fall On light or serious hearts, with stern or gentle call. XLVIII No vague, uncertain sound Within these walls confound The wandering mind, nor cheat the listening ear! No thoughts, which wildly range Thro' ways perplex'd and strange, Bewilder him who speaks and those who hear! No brain infect with pestilential lies, Here weave its flimsy web of tangled sophistries! XLIX No fancies quaint and vain, Engender'd in the brain Of weak, fantastic, ceremonial priest The simple rites disguise, By hearts devout and wise Bequeath'd of men, whose martyr faith releas'd The captive Church from Rome's corroding chain, And gave to human thought its liberty again! L Nor ever trace be found, On this devoted ground, Of priestcraft upon mental thraldom built; Nor impious pride invade His office who hath made Atonement, once for all, for human guilt; Nor dare dissever, with usurp'd controul, From His immediate grace the bruised and bleeding soul. LI Better such arts become Yon genuine brood of Rome, Who prowl and prey with secret, stealthy tread; In life's last hour molest The heart in Christ at rest, And swoop, like vultures, on the dying bed; Perplex the parting soul with bigot lies, And mock the failing sense with antic juggleries. LII Far other task be theirs, Whom, with consenting prayers, Hereafter on this spot the Church shall hear Unfold the Scripture sense, And faithfully dispense The bread of life to hungry heart and ear;â No priestly caste, a priestly rule who bear, But stewards of Christ's grace, dispensing all they share. LIII No grim ascetic here, With monkish rule austere, Its social nature from man's heart expel! No votaress, sad and pale, Assume the shroud-like veil, Nor pine unpitied in her prison cell! No false, exclusive sanctity the grace Blaspheme, by Christ bestow'd on all our human race! LIV But household virtues sweet, And chaste affections meet Within this House, and build their homes around! Here pairs their love refresh, Whom God hath made one flesh! Here child and parent, side by side, be found! Till each domestic hearth a type display Of that last glorious Church to crown Earth's latter day. LV But ere that dawn appear, Dark times of grief and fear And dire convulsion in the world must be; Plagues, famines, earthquakes, wars, In sun and moon and stars Signs of Heaven's wrath, and earth in anarchy; While Christian hearts, expectant, to the sky Look up, and know that their redemption draweth nigh. LVI Perchance even now a sound, As from Hell's depths profound, The ear may catch, like thunder heard from far; Even now a lurid cloud The horizon doth enshroud, Big with pent storm and elemental war; And earth hath signs of fear and blind distress,â But we in patience still, forewarn'd, our souls possess. LVII Whatever Time may breed, In faith we sow our seed,â In faith upon the waters cast our bread; In faith this fortress raise, To guard, in after days, Our children's souls when we are with the dead, And o'er this turf, to-day so fresh and green, Shall many a scatter'd tomb which hides our dust be seen. LVIII Ours be the toil and cost! Nor shall their aim be lost; The end and issue, doubt not, He will bless, Who through the course of time Evolves, in growth sublime, New Heavens and Earth,âthe Realm of Righteousness. Brothers, our task is doneâour offering made;â Wend home with thankful hearts,âthe corner stone is laid. ENGLAND'S MISSION. SONNETS. 1851. Written for the Centenarian Jubilee of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. I Art thou content to be the modern Tyreâ Half pedlar and half pirate of the world? To count the sails of merchant navies furl'd In thy full ports?âto know that some admire And many fear, and almost all desire To see thee from thy throne of empire hurl'd, And o'er thy palace-halls the smoke-wreaths curl'd, Which speak the presence of avenging fire? Thine, England, is the sceptre of the sea, That thou mayst bear God's message thro' the earth, And spread the truth which makes man's spirit free, Kindling on many a bright colonial hearth A flame from that pure altar, rear'd for thee Long sinceâan heir-loom of uncounted worth. II But hast thou to thy destiny been true, And bravely play'd the part to thee assign'd, Dispensing to the tribes of human-kind Of heavenly truth the fertilizing dew, And labouring hard the heathen and the Jew In one great bond of Christian love to bind? What are thy boons to man's benighted mind? How much, for service done him, is thy due? From thine imperial throne, proud Queen, look forth, Survey thy boundless empire, and declare In farthest East and West, and South and North, What trace is found of thy maternal care? What generous zeal, that subject lands may share The Gospel-pearl's inestimable worth? III Mistress thou art of matterânot of mind; The elements obey thee;âon the foam Of the sea-waves thou dwell'st as in a home; Canst bind and loose the pinions of the wind;â Control the lightningâpathways force or find Through earth's dark entrails, where thou will'st to roam; And like a restless and resistless gnome, The granite mountains into powder grind. 'Tis thus the heathen know thee; thus behold, With shuddering awe, the paths thy steps have trod, As of a demon who hath power to mould Earth to his will; and while they fear thy rod, Deem thy sons curstâpredestined from of old To vengeance, as a race without a God. IV Can a clean thing come out of an unclean, Life-giving waters from a tainted spring? Can sensual hearts the songs of Zion sing, High faith be born of abject thoughts and mean? The Gospel-torch, if lit at hearths obscene, O'er new-found worlds celestial radiance fling? Can fiend-like hate speed angels on the wing, And Hell's worst discord breed Heaven's peace serene? O England, wouldst thou do thine office well, Evangelizing earth's remotest ends, First cleanse the homes in which thy children dwell From social wrong, which God and man offends; From fraud that robs, from factions that rebel, From greed and avarice, making foes of friends. V A stately ship is scudding o'er the main, Her sails full set, with favouring wind and tide; To speed like hers the ocean seems not wide; Her masts beneath their canvass bend and strain, Proudly her keel ploughs through the watery plain; But evil faces scowl across her sideâ Grim felon aspects, fierce and murderous-eyedâ Rogues, whom their country will no more retain. So forth they fare, by her august commands To people a new empire, to become Progenitors of rogues in other lands, To make a hell of their appointed home; To spread with pregnant hearts and dexterous hands Crime and pollution, wheresoe'er they roam. VI Prolong the scene;âa statelier vessel sails In the same track, and bears a worthier freight; Propitious omens on her voyage wait! Smooth be the waves, and prosperous the gales From which the settlers in Australian vales Expect the fathers of their Church and Stateâ The men whose deeds, Heaven grant, not yet too late, Shall live hereafter in heroic tales. Speed, modern Argo, speed upon thy track, Those who shall feed the flockânot shear the fleece; From error's path bring many a wanderer back; From sin's strong bonds imprison'd souls release, And win a world, which else had gone to wrack, To the mild empire of the Prince of Peace. VII Who are the Heroes of the latter day? The lords of earthâthe champions of mankind? Think not, O Christian, those great hearts to find Amidst the carnage of the battle fray, Nor where fierce conquerors gory sceptres sway, And on men's necks oppressive burdens bind, Well-pleased the faces of their race to grind, And see obsequious multitudes obey. But seek them in the vast colonial wildâ The mitre, not the helmet, on their browâ Wrestling with wrong, in love and patience mild,â Through good and ill still faithful to their vow,â Training the savage, like a docile child, Before their Lord's victorious cross to bow. THE BLACK FENCE. âThe Black Fenceâ extends along the grounds of a gentleman recently converted to the Romish Church, and distinguished by his active zeal in her cause, The scenery of the poem is entirely real. 'Twas at the point of sunrise, on a clear October day, That through the neighbouring village-fields I took my lonely way; The fields, well known in former days, which lie around the Grange; But years had past since I saw them last, and brought a doleful change. For where the ancient footpath lay, by briery hedge and stile, And hill and valley stretch'd away for many a beauteous mile,â Where grass grew green, and wild flowers bloom'd, refreshing soul and sense, Now lour'd along the whole domain, a black and frowning fence. A dismal sight to a poet's eye it was, as you may think, That black and frowning fence, without a break, without a chink; Hiding all the glorious landscape, and girding it about With impenetrable palings, grim within and grim without. Then my spirit's eyes were open'd, and I saw, as poets see, The visible and the viewless world how closely they agree; And the black and frowning fence became, to this poor thought of mine, Of changes in these latter days a symbol and a sign.â âOf changes dark and troublousâfor the air is full of change, Perplexing English hearts and minds with doubt obscure and strange; And a sword hath come on each English home, and a time of mortal strife, For the truths on which Man's soul must feed, and the breath of his inner life. And 'tis not the good and the wicked now who for right and wrong contend, But brother with kind brotherâloving friend with loving friend; And the true are ranged against the true, and the good against the good, And my spirit wrought with uneasy thought as I looked on that fence of wood. I thoughtâHad it a voice to speak, like this its speech might be:â âHere I stand a black partition-line between the bond and free; âBetween the sons of England's Church, their altar and their home, âAnd those who bend the captive neck and bow the knee to Rome. âI stand, a sign of discord, to divide and keep apart âThe warm and generous sympathies of English heart and heart; âA black and baleful monitor of hate and strife, to last, âTill the cup of Rome's enchantments fail, and her cruel reign be past. âI close encircle those within and compass them around, âAs the spell of priestcraft cramps the soul in its dark and narrow bound; âOn those without I sternly frown, a sore to heart and eye, âWhile I cast my shadow o'er their land, and half shut out their sky.â Even so, thought I,âthy words are sooth, ill-favour'd thing of oak, And in thy last the voice itself of the old enchantress spoke! And sorely doth she labour now, like thee, to stretch her pale Round English hearts and English homes and English hill and dale. Ah! woe for them, the simple ones, entangled in her spell, The souls that in the twilight of her dreary prison dwell! In the blessed air of freedom they no longer claim a part, They have lost their English birthright and the true old English heart. To them, nor truth, nor falsehood can be what either seems, For their spirits grope and stumble in a shadow-land of dreams: Mesmeric sleep hath seized them, and they reel as they were drunk, With the spiritual witchcrafts of the priest and of the monk. They must give their souls to triple crowns and copes and scarlet hats;â Themselvesâand not their idolsâto the moles and to the bats: Isaiah ii. 20. Themselves, their homes and substance, their bodies and their souls, To the blind who lead the blinderâto the bats and to the moles. For liberty of mind and will,âfor bold unfetter'd thought,â They must think as they are bidden, and believe what they are taught: They must shut their eyes and ope their ears, fast bound by slavish laws, Rome's hook within their nostrils, and her bridle on their jaws. Alas! and must this curse prevail, these deep delusions spread, Till the pulse of England beats no more, till her noble life hath fled? Must her spirit's light be quench'd in night? must she barter faith and hope For a mumbled Ave-Mary!âfor the blessing of the Pope? Must she see her choicest offspringâevery graced and gifted sonâ Tasteârelishâdrain the poison'd cup, and madden one by one? Must her learned and her pious,âmust her gentle and her brave Be lost in witchery strong as death, and cruel as the grave? Must She, the Imperial Nation, give place, and cease to be The Lady of the Kingdoms, the one birthplace of the free? The land where Thought and Wisdom dwelt in fresh unfading youth? The land where God is worshipp'd still in spirit and in truth? Must She, whose voice was Truth and Might, submit to fawn and whineâ To creep, and crawl, and cringe, and cant, at a Popish idol's shrine? Must Popish candles be her light for altar, home, and hearth, And a crazy old Italian monk her God and Christ on earth? Or shall the indignant spirit of her brave old Saxon mind Burst forth and rend the welkin, like a rushing mighty wind? Shall the fountains of her lowest deep break up and overflow, Till in one whelming flood of wrath are Church and State laid low? Shall a day of tribulation come for people and for priest, Till a sea of blood wash out at length the image of the Beast; And the land spew forth her teachers like a cursed viper-brood, Which have coiled around her heart-strings, which are tainting her life's blood? Such thoughts waxed hot within me as I paced beside the pale; But soon did better hopes arise, and a brighter mood prevail; For now the dark domain was past, and right before mine eye The grey Church-tower distinctly rose between the earth and sky. It stood in peace and silenceâfor the hush of dawn was spread O'er the temple of the living, o'er the chambers of the dead; And the spirit of my Mother soothed the spirit of her son, And I felt a flow of happier thought and livelier faith begun. And nestling close beside the church, like a sweet and docile child, The little graceful village-school in its simple beauty smiled; And above its clear white gable, at a distance, I descried The symbol of the blessed cross on which our Saviour died. And third in that sweet companyâsome paces to the rightâ The dwelling of the pastor on a sudden came in sight: Its chimneys all were smokeless, its repose was calm and deep, For the household still were sleeping sound, as pious Christians sleep. And stretching to the left afar, the lovely landscape lay, O'er which the morn was melting now the twilight cold and grey; And open lea, and hedgerow-tree, and distant mead and lawn Were touch'd with light serene and white from the eyelids of the dawn. And while the prospect filled my soul with its silent, deep repose, Above the far horizon's verge the cloudless sun arose; And the eastern hills were tipp'd and tinged with many a gorgeous hue, And the sky grew bright with sunshine, and the grass was fresh with dew. And the stir of life was felt around, in earth and air and sky, And a thousand carols smote my ear from all sweet birds that fly; And I knew that things which creep on earth, and in the waters swim, Sent up, in silence or in sound, their heartfelt morning hymn. No thought of fear or dark distrust could live in such an hour, And my spirit burst its heavy bonds, and the spells had lost their power; And, imaged forth in that fair scene, I saw, or seemed to see, A blessed type of England's Church, and of what her fate shall be. I saw the hour of darkness pass, and the sun once more ariseâ The glorious Sun of Righteousnessâin her late tempestuous skies; And the dreams and visions of the night had faded quite away, And she woke from sleep, oppress'd but deep, to the light and life of day. She rose and stood like yon grey tower, as then I saw it stand, Begirt by smiling English homesâthe watch-tower of the land; And bending still her steadfast gaze, from earliest morn to even, O'er sunnier hills and vales than those;âthe hills and vales of Heaven. She rose and stood with dauntless brow, for her heart was now at ease,â Brave spirits throng'd around herâchildren clomb about her knees; And there burst, to greet her waking ear, a myriad-throated hymn, From village chapel lone and grey, and cathedral vast and dim. She rose and brake her magic bonds, and cast her cords away, And strode to her appointed strife, where the Camp of darkness lay: Fair as the sun, clear as the moon, when her beams delight us most, And dreadful in her anger as an arm'd and banner'd host. Canticles vi. io. For the hour of woe had sifted her, and now were purged away The false and traitor-hearted from the ranks of her array; And her legions marched in serried files, compact, with one accord, To do or die, like valiant men, in the Battle of the Lord. And the iron heart of Rome grew faint, and her brazen brow turn'd pale, And she shrank aghast from the trumpet-blast and the clang of her foemen's mail; And a throb of trembling hope was felt in the depth of her darkest hells, Through dungeons red with martyrs' blood, and the Inquisition's cells. No peace, but deadly warfare still, between those twain must be, While the one would bind both heart and mind, and the other set them free: No peace for Rome and England, but a stern, relentless strife; Till Light shall vanquish Darkness, Death be swallow'd up of Life. For the tyrant and the despot hate the noble and the brave, Who loose the captive's yoke and break the fetters of the slave: And 'tis England's glorious missionâfar as ocean's billows roll, To kindle freedom's gospel-light in Man's benighted soul. Our Church, where English steeples rise, where English navies roam, Sends bold evangelists abroad, gives pastors true at home; And the open Book is in her hand, and to her alone 'tis given To brighten earth around our path, while she guides our souls to Heaven. You may trace her spirit in the looks of each English passer-byâ In the manly step, and the hearty voice, and the calm and dauntless eye; In the speech of man and maiden, in the face of age and youth, You may read a people trained by Her in the light and love of Truth. She bids her wedded pastors' homes in every village rise, Gladden'd by children's guileless mirth and bright maternal eyes; That so the rudest peasant in her farthest vale may see How beautiful and blest a thing a Christian home may be. She hath wash'd us from ancestral sin in the spirit-cleansing flood, She hath fed the life which then she gave with the Saviour's flesh and blood; She blesses still our marriage morn, she soothes our dying bed,â She gives our bodies back to earth when the deathless soul hath fled. God send her swift deliverance from the plagues which vex her now! God heal the discord in her heart, and chase the trouble from her brow! And when her penal hour hath past, and purged her from her sin, Restore her prosperous state without, and her peace and joy within. God give her wavering clergy back that honest heart and true, Which once was theirs, ere Popish fraud its spells around them threw; Nor let them barter wife and child, bright hearth and happy home, For the drunken bliss of the strumpet-kiss of the Jezebel of Rome. And God console all holy hearts, now yearning for the day, When this black cloud shall pass at length from England's skies away! God help us all to struggle still, with patience and with might, Against darkness, lies, and bondage, for Freedom, Truth, and Light! And God forgive the fallen ones by their own weak hearts betray'd, And convert the misbeliever, and reclaim the renegade! And God unite the good and pure, the faithful and the wise, Till the Dayspring come on the night of Rome, and the Sun of Truth arise! SAINT MARY, THE VIRGIN AND THE WIFE. A COTTAGE ECLOGUE. SISTER OF CHARITY. O Woman, heavy-laden with a weight of care and woe, Whose cheek is pale with watching, and whose eyes with tears o'erflow,â Poor child of want and penury,âsad mother,âwidow'd wife,â So worn that thou canst hardly bear the burden of thy life; Listen gladly, while I tell thee of a comfort and a cure From the blessed Virgin MotherâEver Virginâever pure. She sits beside the throne of God,âshe is the Queen of Heaven, And power and might to her of right are by our Saviour given: He yields her meek submission,âfor a duteous son is He, And to ask whate'er he hath to give, who else so meet as she? O'er Him, o'er us, o'er heaven and earth, her sway must still endure,â She's the blessed Virgin MotherâEver Virginâever pure. A soft and tender heart is her's, as virgins' hearts should be, And she loveth well all things that dwell in earth and air and But Holy Church she loveth bestâthe Holy Church of Rome,â And those who make that Church on earth their harbour and their home: And gladly to that Holy Church would she all hearts allure,â Would the blessed Virgin MotherâEver Virginâever pure. The heretic she favoureth not, who walks in erring ways, Nor blesseth much the wedded lot, nor giveth it her praise: For the wedded life she never knew, nor all its earthly bliss, Nor a husband's fond embraces, nor a daughter's loving kiss; But still a chaste and spotless bride did all her life endure,â Did the blessed Virgin MotherâEver Virginâever pure. She was not born as mortals are, in taint of mortal sin, But all unsoil'dâimmaculateâdivinely pure within; More pure than from her Maker's hands was our first mother Eve,â For so the Holy Father saith, and so we must believe; For the Holy Father's word is still infallible and sure As the blessed Virgin Mother'sâEver Virginâever pure. Then come, afflicted woman, lay thy weary burden down At the blessed Virgin Mother's feet, who wears the heavenly crown; Forsake the ways of errorâbe our Holy Church obey'd, And give thy sickly girl to Her, to live and die a maid: So shalt thou joy and comfort at the gracious hands secure Of the blessed Virgin MotherâEver Virginâever pure. And she shall intercede for thee before the throne of grace, Where she beholds, as angels do, our Heavenly Father's face; And thy daughter shall recover, and thy husband return home, And thou and he shall bow the knee to the Holy Church of Rome; And purgatorial pains for both shall no long time endure, Through our Lady's intercessionâEver Virginâever pure. FEMALE COTTAGER. O Lady, thou art mild and goodâthy voice is soft and kind, And in thy gentle eyes I read a pure and heavenly mind; And like an angel from above hast thou been with me here In the day of my affliction, when my heart was dark and drear; In the absence of my husbandâin the sickness of my child, Thou hast been a light from heaven itself, so merciful and mild. Thou hast sat beside my daughter's bedâthou hast brought her dainty food, And medicine to assuage her pain, and looks which did her good; Thou hast still'd her when she murmur'dâthou hast soothed her when she wept,â Thou hast watched and waked when I, o'er-wrought with toil and sorrow, slept; I would give my life a thousand times to please of profit thee,â But, ladyâladyâask not that which must not, cannot be. I know that thou art holier far than I can e'er become, Though thou indeed dost love the creed of thy mother Church of Rome; And, lady, for thy gentle sake, I'll speak with reverence mild Of that which seems, to thy pure heart, religion undefiled; But never, lady, here on earth, can we in faith agree, For there lies a gulf between us, which I cannot cross to thee. I love the Virgin Mother, and I cherish her dear name As an holy thought to soothe the soul in this world of sin and shame; I bless her gentle memory, which hath triumph'd o'er the tomb, For the blessing which she brought to Man by the travail of her womb; But I cannot bow the knee to her, as though she reigned in heaven, Nor hope through herâbut through her Sonâto have my sins forgiven. For her body saw corruption, and her soul was left in hell, Where the souls of the departed till the resurrection dwell; She never brake the bonds of death, nor burst her charnel-prison, Nor, like her blessed Son, the Lord, to God's right hand hath risen; But her spirit dwells in Paradiseâher body sleeps in dust, With the spirits of the righteousâwith the bodies of the just. Thou say'st the Roman Bishop saith she was not born in sin, But from the womb immaculateâdivinely pure within; But nought of this, O lady dear, is written in God's Word, And nought of this, our parson saith, the ancient Fathers heard; And I feel, within my heart of hearts, that true it cannot be, But that she indeed was born in sinâin sin like thee and me. 'Tis little that the Scripture tells,âbut e'en that little shows That she, like us, was weak and frail in her trials and her woes; That she sometimes deserved rebuke, as thou or I may do,â That she was still, in thought and will, fallen Woman through and through: O joy! for us that she was thus, and shall be, without end, No Goddessâbut a sister;ânot an angelâbut a friend. For surely if her birth had been, like that of her blest Son, Unstained by sin ancestralâour redemption were undone; He scarce had been our Brother hereâHis spirit scarce had known How holiest hearts, assail'd and stung by sharp temptations, groan; Unless through Woman, as she is, his human life began, To me it seems the Son of God was scarce the Son of Man. Thou say'st she died a virgin still,â'tis what we cannot know, But I should grieve could I believe that it indeed was so: For holier, as it seems to me, than one of single life Is the gracious Christian mother, and the godly Christian wife; And more to wife and mother than to maid unwed is given Of the griefs and cares which sift the soul, and make it fit for heaven. There are fountains, in a woman's heart, of holiest joy and bliss, Which a husband's love alone unseals, and an infant's blessed kiss; There are fountains, in a woman's heart, of holiest grief and pain, Which in the saintliest virgin life must shut and sealed remain: Thou, lady, in thy lonely path, may'st walk like angels here,â But souls like mine must God refine by the trouble and the tear. My child lies on her fever'd bed,âher father is at sea,â And I've need to pray, both night and day, for her and him and me: And warmer, holier is the prayer for husband and for child Than aught that e'er unclosed the lips of virgin undefiled: And it solaces my aching heart, and it soothes my throbbing brow, To think that blessed Mary may have felt what I feel now. I have thought of her in happier daysâin days of home delight,â When I pillow'd on my husband's breast my weary head at night; I have seen her, with my fancy's eye, in the glory which she shed O'er Joseph's peaceful home and hearthâo'er Joseph's marriage bed: In her joys and in her sorrowsâin her late and early life,â O how holy was the Virgin !âO how holy was the Wife! I ask sometimes,âwhen this dark earth has closed at last o'er me, And my disembodied spirit to the spirit-world may fleeâ Shall I meet the blessed Mary, and behold her face to face? Will she greet me like a daughter in her goodness and her grace? Shall her spirit then respond to mine, and each the other know, By the household joys which both have feltâby the wife's and mother's woe? I cannot tellâ'tis vain to askâbut, lady, rob me not Of thoughts and hopes which sweeten now the sorrows of my lot; Let me cleave to that dear image of the mother of my Lord,â The sinful, but the sanctifiedâthe loved, but not adored,â As one with me in heart and hope, though purer, holier far,â Yea holier than the holiest souls of maid or mother are. And, dearest lady, tempt me not my daughter's life to save, By burying her, restored to health, in a dreary living grave. On her God's blessed will be done;âif He shall spare her life, Let her live as seemeth best to herâa virgin or a wife; But rather than devote her now to that unnatural doom, Let me kneel beside her death-bedâlet me weep upon her tomb. And press me not to join thy Church;âI dare not leave my ownâ For in that I've found an access sure to my heavenly Father's throne; And His Spirit witnesseth with mine that there his grace abides, And he loveth yet our Zion more than all the world besides. Take then the path thou deem'st the rightâand, lady, so must I, For in the blessed English Church I mean to live and die. Your Pope may be a learned priest, and a prince of high degree, But God and Jesus Christ are more infallible than he; And I in God, through Jesus Christ, rest all my faith and hope, And indeed I cannot part with these for Prelate or for Pope: I still must keep my simple creed, and tread the path I've trod, By the help of my Redeemer,âby the guidance of my God. I must bend my knee to Him alone, whom all the worlds obey, To Him who breathed the breath of life into this mortal clay; To Him through whose atoning blood is all our guilt forgiven, To Him through whom the sinful soul is born anew for heaven; To Him who reigneth and shall reign o'er heaven and all its host; To the Everlasting Fatherâthe Sonâthe Holy Ghost. I know that I must struggle hard the Christian crown to win,â Sore fightings must be mine without, and frequent fears within: But frail and feeble though I beâpoor daughter of the dust, There's ONE will intercede for me, and him alone I'll trust: 'Twould shake my perfect faith in Him on weaker names to call, And though there were a million such, He's more than worth them all. Then, gracious lady, blame me not, nor deem thy boons unfelt, Because I pray not as thou pray'st, nor kneel where thou hast knelt: Between us hangs a veil, which we as yet may not remove, Till faith and hope, their office done, are swallowed up in love; And Protestant and Papist meet before the Eternal throne, To see as they have still been seen, and to know as they are known. SUNSET IN ARRAN. The Sun had vanish'd to his rest Behind the mountains yesterday, Whose towering ridge shuts out the west With all its dyes from Brodick bay: Eastward the light was dim and grey,â On wood and slope, on land and sea, Already partial twilight lay, Though sails as white as white can be Gleam'd on the horizon's verge, far off as eye could see. But westward, o'er the mountain's height, The sunset skies were all aglow With one rich blaze of crimson light Shot up from unseen depths below; White clouds were floating to and fro Around and over Goatfel's cone; Ben-Noosh did o'er his shoulders throw A misty mantle, which was blown Aside from time to time, and all his outline shown. You might have deem'd that crimson blaze Effulgence of volcanic flame, Such as in old primeval days From out those granite craters came, And almost put the sun to shame: Those mists into thin wreaths of smoke Imagination well might frame, From which sulphureous flashes broke, While subterranean shocks redoubled stroke on stroke. But now 'twas silence all around, Save for the torrent's distant roar, And that continuous solemn sound Of breakers on the shingled shore: The ear no kindred witness bore To those wild shapings of the eye, No tokens of the pangs which tore Earth's womb, when, with parturient cry, She yean'd those giant rocks and cast them forth on high. That echoed long millennia past,â Its like will once repeated be, When that Arch-angel trumpet-blast Shall peal through earth and air and sea, And set the tomb-imprison'd free, While flashes of electric fire Fulfil their penal ministry, And kindle earth's funereal pyre, Foredoom'd to that dread day of Heaven's avenging ire. High lesson, which the outward sense Conveys to faith's awakened eye, Through signs which God's omnipotence Hath traced upon the earth and sky: They must not pass unheeded by,â Such lights as those of yester-eve, And all at once dissolve and die, And not a trace behind them leave On human hearts which hope, on human hearts which grieve. Yet all too soon the glow was o'er, The crimson light had died away, And wood and mountain, sea and shore, Were veil'd in one continuous grey; Save that a streak of sunshine lay On green Dun Fiume's north-western slope; Bright promise of the coming day, Type of the dying Christian's hope Of resurrection, seen through faith's clear telescope. FAREWELL TO ARRAN. Once more, romantic isle, once more, To all thy charms of sea and shore, To peaks where eagles dwell, To heathery brae and wimpling burn, And beds of foxglove, mix'd with fern, A sad, a fond farewell! To me and mine, for many a year, Hast thou with ample cause been dear, As thou to all art fair: My wife, with childhood's rapturous gaze, Above thee watch'd the sunset blaze From yon dim coast of Ayr; And when thy jagged ridge shone clear Through summer evening's atmosphere, Unveil'd by cloud or mist, Beneath that glorifying light It seem'd, to her undoubting sight, One mass of amethyst. Even I, when first, across the Clyde, Thy towering summits I descried, Though then a man full-grown, Scarce deem'd thee a terrestrial strand, On which a vulgar foot might land, Which vulgar lords might own. Around thee a mysterious haze Then floated in the wondering gaze Of eyes that love to dream; To such, thou wast a fairy land, Not yet made earthly by the hand Of disenchanting steam. To dwellers on the Carrick coast, Ere Watt arose, was thine almost As yet a virgin shore; Columbus or Magellan might Have envied the adventurous wight, Who durst its crags explore. Time was, within the narrow span Since I became a married man, When here, in Brodick bay, My wife and I, untimely left Of locomotive aid bereft, For days imprison'd lay. In sight appear'd no friendly sail,â The very boat which brought the mail Not yet for days was due; At lastâbut in a fisher's boat,â On Sunday morn we got afloat, Two sturdy Gaels our crew. At day-break summon'd from our bed, That morn we had not broken bread, Nor bread on board had we; And bound for Rothsay's distant bay, Enjoy'd, as hungry people may, A perfect calm at sea. Our boatmen pull'd with right good will, Yet hours and hours the mountains still Their shadows o'er us cast; Until sprang up a rippling gale, And cheer'd our hearts, and fill'd our sail, And bore us home at last. The quayâthe houseâthe meal appear'd,â We veer'd and tack'd, and tack'd and veer'd,â The wind was much to blame; Till just upon the stroke of one, As crowds flock'd out from service done, To shore at last we came. A most disreputable plight, In sober Presbyterian sight, Just then was ours, no doubt; Yet on our breakfast straight we fell, With hunger which no shame could quell, And food could scarce drive out. Since then, through life's meridian prime, Sore needing rest, from time to time, From sickness and from care, Fair isle, within thee and around, Our children and ourselves have found Clear waves and genial air. Nor less our thanks are due to thee, That through thy glens we wander free From dull decorum's rules, And, unassail'd by jeer or scoff, Conventional restraints throw off, Which hamper fashion's fools. However it to some may seem, No unimportant boon I deem The license, thus bestow'd, With Nature on her mountain throne To commune by ourselves alone, Her wilds our brief abode. From dull parochial feuds and strife, From all the jars of social life, From stir of things and men Escaped, to cleave the briny surf, To tread the unfrequented turf Of mountain-side and glen. So haply shall our children find An unsophisticated mind From slavish laws exempt, And artificial forms of thought, A blessing to be cheaply bought By half the world's contempt. And yet must I perforce confess That in this rocky wilderness, Beside this lonely sea, To breathe for ever mountain air And simplÃ¨ mountain pleasures share, Is not the life for me. Good are the mountains; good the shore, Yet, sooth to say, I covet more The converse of my kind; The beaten, broad high road of life With social stir and tumult rife, The clash of mind with mind. For ten months' work give two months' play, And let me to the hills away, To rest at will or rove, Then, well refresh'd in heart and brain, For England ho !âto work again,â That's just the life I love. There areâand who but counts them wise?â Whom lonely nature satisfies,â Whose spirits self-possest, In wilds can find, almost unsought, Exhaustless loreâfor loftiest thought Abundant food and rest. All praise to such !âa nobler task Than common minds can share or ask Hath Heaven to them assign'd; They drink at truth's unsullied fount, On eagles' wings 'tis theirs to mount And grasp where few can find. A less ambitious lot is ours, Who exercise our feebler powers In paths which men frequent; The daily task, by Him above Mark'd out, in humble faith and love, Te execute content. Nor long, I deem, can we withdraw, From scenes which His disposing law Hath made our proper sphere, Nor long, without some hurt, disown The ties which with our growth have grown And strengthen'd, year by year. To me, a bard of English birth, And heart-bound to that spot of earth On which my life began, Pure though he be of thought and will, A Scotchman is a Scotchman still, But half my countryman. Of all that doth his soul inspire I reverence much, and much admire, Nor grudge him love that's due; But find, when near him I abide, That still a gulf both deep and wide Extends between us two. He reasons by a different rule,â Was nurtured in an alien school,â His notions jar with mine; Much he contemns which I revere, Much which I love not, holds most dear Of human and divine. Within his tents I love full well Awhile, from time to time, to dwell, For change of thought and scene; But homeward soon my spirit turns, And, with instinctive ardour, burns To be where it hath been; With minds of kindred growth to think, To walk and talk, to eat and drink, To dwell, in truth and deed, Amongst the men with whom I share One sphere of thought, one form of prayer, One altar and one creed. So be it nowâthough loth to part, Fair isle, with an unwavering heart I quit thee for my home; Thanks! for thy boons, in years long past Enjoy'd with him whose lot is cast Beyond the ocean foam;â With those who still in peace remain, Who wear not yet a heavier chain Than that of filial fear; And those whom all-indulgent Heaven To our parental charge hath given Since first we sojourn'd here. Farewell!âand if henceforth no more We tread thy loved and lovely shore, This we at least can sayâ That in our deepest springs of thought Thy influence hath a blessing wrought Which will not pass away. PERSICOS ODI. Lady, if the project please thee, And the time convenient be, I propose to-night to tease thee With my company at tea. No luxurious preparation For my entertainment make; Viand rare, or choice potation,â Crumpetâmuffinâbutter'd cake. Household smiles and friendly greeting, Conversation frank and free,â These will make a pleasant meetingâ These are what I ask of thee. THREE TIMES NINE. It is an old and hackney'd strain,â The burthen of a worn-out song, Again repeated and again, As life's swift current rolls along, And death draws nearer, year by year, And eyes grow dim and locks turn grey,â But still 'tis sweet to married ear, The verse which greets the wedding-day. This year, once more, we spend it, sweet, Beneath the mountains, by the sea, Near which so loved thy childish feet To wander unrestrain'd and free; And thou consorting with a tribe Of Scottish cousins, fond and dear, Did'st thus, though London-born, imbibe The spirit of a mountaineer. Far from the crowded haunts of men, If fate permitted, thou would'st make Thy dwelling in the loneliest glen, Beside the least frequented lake; Would'st choose the dashing mountain-stream, The winds o'er snowy peaks that sweep, To mingle with thy midnight dream, To wake thee from thy morning sleep;â Would'st breed and rear a savage race Of supple joint and sinewy limb, Expert the eagles' haunts to trace, And seize the salmon where they swim; Whose souls no reverential awe For social customs should have felt, Nor lost that rude contempt for law Which marks the nature of the Celt. So be it!âin thy spirits' flow Of freedom, nought have I to blame; Its wildest outbursts well I know That wedlock hath a spell to tame: And thou, albeit thy heart may roam Full oft to highland flood and fell, Canst cheer a quiet English home, And charm an English circle well. 'Twas no blind chance which call'd thee forth, But Heaven's benign and bounteous will, From thy beloved paternal North, Thy proper mission to fulfil. Look out!âthy own ancestral land, Seen dim and distant o'er the sea, Hath past into a stranger's hand,â A home no more for thine and thee. But fast by England's central spot Is now thy place of love and rest; The accepted, not the chosen lot, Is that which ever proves the best. Heaven gives thee, on thy native soil, Meet interchange of work and play;â Thy southern home for months of toil, Thy weeks of highland holiday. This year, in our connubial life, Is but the last of twenty-seven, Whose summers thou hast spent, sweet wife,â Eighteen on earth, and nine in heaven: So oft the magic power of steam Hath freed thee from thy prison chain, And help'd thee to renew the dream Of childhood's happiest days again. The mingled cup of grief and joy, Which others drain, we two have drain'd; Our gold hath had its due alloy, Much have we lost, and something gain'd: And now upon the downward slope, As on we speed, of life's decline, Not yet exempt from fear and hope Is this brief view of thine and mine. Almost without a cloud of grief, Our first nine years in sunshine pass'd,â Our summer boughs were green in leaf, When one was shiver'd by the blast: Nine more roll'd on,âbeside this shore, With sons and daughters richly blest, We found, as we had found before, The needful boon of health and rest. Nine more are gone,âagain we meet, Our number undiminish'd still,â But one beneath the tropic heat Doth his appointed task fulfil; And one, a scholar not ungraced, Is gone to earn a scholar's bread, And two have on our knees been placed, While life's declining summer fled. For all that hath been ours so long,â For all that still continues ours,â For life in both still sound and strong,â For mind untouch'd in all its powers,â For whatsoe'er of budding good In sons or daughters we can see,â For faith and hope's appointed food,â Kind heaven be blest by thee and me! On what remains of mortal years We will not think, nor blindly guess What store reserv'd of smiles or tears Life's coming page may blot or bless; To-day at least we hope to spend Together,âwith to-morrow's sun My sojourn in this isle must end,â This last should be our happiest one. Come forth, and by the lone sea-shore, And through the woods we two will stray, And many a shady nook explore, And many a sunny creek and bay; And, if thou wilt, when thou art laid Beneath the boughs, or by the sea, I'll read the rhymes I lately made, When thou wast far away from me. A trivial tale do they unfold,â A string of facts from first to last, Connecting feelings new and old,â The present with the dreamy past; The days when thou and I were young, Bridegroom and bride, with later life, In which approaching age hath flung Its shadows upon man and wife. So, when to-morrow I am gone, My last few idle days to spend Beside his native lake with one, Ere we had met, my bosom friend,â Shalt thou, on loving thoughts intent, Read o'er that strange, uxorious lay, And think how pleasantly we spent Our twenty-seventh wedding-day. MUCH ADO ABOUT LITTLE. I.âTHE WHEREABOUT. There is a quiet Western town,â In Worcester's fruitful shire it stands, 'Midst orchards of world-wide renown, And fragrant growth of garden lands. Beside it winds the Avon stream, Above it slopes the Breadon height; And Malvern, in the sunset gleam, Seems all ablaze with crimson light. And ere the railway's iron age Expell'd Mac-Adam's age of stone, Or steam was harness'd to the stage Then whirl'd by four-horse nerve and bone, Oft, seated on the Worcester mail, Descending by the London road, I mark'd, beneath me in the vale, The river, how it flash'd and flow'd; The river banks, how green they grew, The fields, how bright with fruit and flower; The stately shape, the sober hue Of that majestic old Church tower. It was a sight to touch with joy The heart of middle-aged or old, And I was then a beardless boy, A scholar of Etonian mould. But on my spirit's inward eye That scene a deeper rapture pour'd; It spoke of home and kindred nigh, Of holiday delights restored. Almost, from that high point of road, The Wrekin's summit I might see; Almost, above my sire's abode, The loftier ridges of the Clee. The breezes there seem'd fraught with bliss From haunts in which I lov'd to roam, And stirr'd my spirit like the kiss Which welcom'd son and brother home. And thus that tower and town became A sacred land-mark to my view, And round my heart their cherish'd name Entwined with pleasant memories grew. II.âTHE WHEREABOUT UNVISITED. The banks of Thames are fresh and green, The towers which crown them passing fair, And churlish souls forget their spleen, And homesick hearts grow happy there: But slow and slimy is thy stream, Flat are thy flowerless banks, O Cam, And dimly does the daylight gleam Through miles of smoke round Birmingham: And he who travels through that smoke, To rest beside that sluggish slime,â Is not among the happiest folk Within the bounds of space and time. In one brief month I bade farewell To school and to my boyhood's home, In new, less pleasant haunts to dwell, Through new, less pleasant roads to roam. And years roll'd by, and still I pass'd Through that delicious vale no more; It seem'd that I had look'd my last On tower and town, on stream and shore. And now, as time fled swiftly on, Its beauty, and almost its name, With boyish pleasures past and gone, A memory and a dream became. It sank into the phantom land Of vanish'd scenes beloved of yore,â When joy was felt, and schemes were plann'd, In manhood felt and plann'd no more. In memory's deepest cell it lay, With those romantic banks of Rea,â With that old mansion far away, So long the home of mine and me; With that ancestral mansion dear, Long lost, still loved with vain regret, In which, at Christmas, year by year, Aunts, uncles, cousins, kinsfolk met;â With oriel windows richly stain'd, With passage long and creaking stair, With treasur'd records which remain'd Of the first Charles's sojourn there; With oratory small and lone Where saintly knees in prayer had bent, Or e'er the altar with the throne Went down before the parliament; With spacious lawns and shrubberies green, With urns and statues choicely placed, With gravel walks that wound between, In somewhat of artistic taste; With flights of steps which from the door Led down to that old-fashion'd pond, With fir-tree clumps that grew before, With hills and churches seen beyond; With these, with scenes like these beloved,â With that small town by Kennet's side, Where first a school-boy's cares I proved, When first I felt a school-boy's pride; With that eternal Roman road, Without a break, without a bend, Which homeward when we started, show'd Where twelve miles off the stage should end; With Eton's shade, with Windsor's height, With sport and study, grief and joy, Which train for deeds of future might The spirit of the English boy;â With these, like half-forgotten things, That tower and town neglected lay, While hope and fancy plum'd their wings, And boyhood's dreams to youth's gave way. Then love was born;âwithin my veins The burning blood like wildfire ran; I felt the pleasures and the pains, The cares and triumphs of the man; But still, in hours of calmer thought, When, from the present's strife and din, The mind repose and refuge sought In that sweet past which slept within,â Among the dreams of old delight, Evok'd from memory's spectral cell, Return'd that scene, so fresh, so bright, Belov'd so long, retain'd so well. III.âTHE WHEREABOUT VISITED. âCome list to me, my bonny bride, (For such this ring will make thee soon),â And judge if I aright provide Employment for our honey-moon. âMy parents ne'er have seen thy face, And they must learn to love it well; And so with them, a little space, We two, ere we return, will dwell. âBut first, as fitting 'tis and right, Like the first couple, all alone, For some few weeks of pure delight, We'll make an Eden of our own;â âAn Eden of congenial thought, Where heart to heart, and mind to mind, Shall teach in turn, in turn be taught Its proper paradise to find. âAnd with the present and the past The unknown future shall combine The rainbow tints of hope to cast O'er this twin life of thine and mine. âAnd first 'twill be a joy sublime To trace with thee the self-same track Which brought me, in my schoolboy-time, To home and friends and freedom back. âSo, having seal'd these vows of ours In yonder Church, our course we'll bend Tow'rd Oxford's stately domes and towers, And there our first day's travel end. âAnd when through college-court and hall We've paced with reverential tread, And view'd the relics, each and all, Bequeath'd us by the saintly dead,â âBy Worcester's old cathedral tower, 'Midst orchard-slopes and hop-grounds wide, We'll twine once more our nuptial bower For brief repose on Severn's side. âThe third day's travel shall reveal My childhood's home,âmy home no more; And thou shalt share what I shall feel In haunts belov'd from days of yore. âNext night on Ludlow's castled steep, Beside the banks of winding Teme,â Where Milton slept, we two will sleep, Where Milton dream'd, we two will dream. âThence through a smiling border land Of tufted hills and verdant vales, We'll journey on, until we stand Beneath the mountain peaks of Wales. âWe'll view Llangollen's pastoral hills, We'll climb the Cader's giant side, We'll quaff Dolgelly's crystal rills, And then on Barmouth's sands abide. âThe western breeze thy strength shall brace, The western sea-breeze cool thy brow, And then once more we'll shift our place,â Still onward, onward, I and thou. âWe'll garnish Gelert's grave with flowers, Thence passing through sweet Gwynant's vale, Where o'er Llanberis Snowdon towers We'll hoist on that small lake our sail. âThe Menai bridge, not yet complete, Caernarvon Castle famed in song, And Capel CÃ¼rig's lone retreat, Will scarce arrest our progress long. âBut once again by Severn's side, Beneath the Wrekin's slope, will we With loving hearts at rest abide, With hearts that long for thee and me.â Thus to my willing bride I sang, And thus while, on our wedding-day, With peal on peal the belfry rang,â We started on our westward way: But now the second sun had set (So long in Oxford linger'd we) And night closed darkly in, ere yet The towers of Worcester we could see. So nine miles off our course we stay'd In that small town on Avon's shore, And there our second halt we made, And talk'd our two days' travel o'er. Beneath the old grey tower we slept,â The river flow'd in silence nigh, And nightingales beside it kept Sweet vigils for our lullaby. And when together we had past That landmark of my earlier life, Bridegroom and bride seem'd changing fast To soberer, happier man and wife. Forward in full career we sped To good or ill, to joy or pain, And thrice nine years almost had fled Ere I beheld that town again. IV.âTHE WHEREABOUT REVISITED. A younger sister had my bride, A creature form'd in daintiest mould,â Sweet-voiced, sweet-thoughted, loving-eyed, And when we wedded, six years old. To woman's ripe estate she grew Unpluck'd,âa stately virgin flower; Then first a genuine passion knew, And bow'd her neck to Hymen's power. And now full two connubial years Had left behind her wedding-morn, And wedlock's weight of hopes and fears, Of joys and sorrows she had borne; When to our home her spouse and she,â A grave divine,âa glorious dame,â In wedlock's awful pomp, to see Their elderly relations came. âNow, master bard,â (in wedded pride Thus spoke to me that matron fair) âYou and my consort must divide Your next week's duty, share for share. âHe from your pulpit here shall teach Your willing flock, and you shall hie Some sixty railway miles, and preach Where else his Sunday work would lie. âThus with my sister two days yet We two unparted may abide, And you for your reward shall get, At our expenseâa railway ride.â Obedient to the word I went, For mine had been a heart of stone To see Joan's heart for Darby rent, And Darby's heart distraught for Joan. So when the week drew near its close, The wings of steam had borne me nigh The spot where once, in brief repose, Slumber'd and dream'd my bride and I. And thus once more I came to view Those banks so bright with fruit and flower, The stately shape, the sober hue Of that majestic old Church tower. V.âTHE VICARAGE. The Vicar's wall is on the right As from the station home you fare, Facing a street by day and night So still, life seems extinguish'd there. Around and in it silence dwells As of a place long past its prime; Best broken by the sound of bells Which from the grand old abbey chime. Across the winding ancient street The trees, which fence the churchyard round, Almost with outstretch'd branches meet Their sisters in the vicarage ground. And, shelter'd by the latters' shade, The modest mansion stands retired; By tenants of its master's trade A mansion to be much desired. There, on a bracing eve of May, Did I from one-horse chaise alight, Just as the skies were robed in grey, And twilight deep'ning into night. The vicar and the vicar's wife Were absent both, as you may guess; No sound of childhood's sport or strife Disturb'd or cheer'd the loneliness. But on the threshold, frank and bland, The curate to receive me stood; The curate's wife was near at hand, In ripe maternal womanhood. And one beside,âa spinster dame, Whose native spring of cheerful mirth Not fourscore years and six could tame, Nor rob her of her joy on earth. Soon at a well replenish'd board I sat with those congenial three; Fresh were the eggs, and freely pour'd The long libations of the tea; And still, as wit and mirth increas'd, Clear'd was the board and drain'd the bowl; And we, that night, enjoy'd âthe feast Of reason and the flow of soul:â And ere to welcome sleep I sank, I felt that town had charms more rare Than tower or tree or river-bank, Or orchard bloom or pasture fair. VI.âTHE ABBEY CHURCH. Bound by no laws of time or place Are Christian hearts for praise and prayer, Their templeâuniversal space, Their serviceâalwaysâeverywhere. Ill fares it with the man who needs A stated hour, a certain shrine, A fixed routine of form and creed Recited duly line by line; Whose whole devotion ebbs and flows At intervals of night and day, And sinks and rises, comes and goes,â This moment here, the next away. And yet, while man continues man, And govern'd by his nature's law,â Resist it as we may or can, Will holy places soothe and awe. Where saintly knees have often knelt A calmer peace the spirit fills, And reverence more devout is felt In churches than in cotton-mills. I would not slight the influence shed By pillar'd aisle, by choir and nave, Or by the memory of the dead Beneath reposing in the grave. The spirit undevout and cold Elsewhere, its nature will retain Where bones of holy men of old For centuries at rest have lain; And those who climb to mountain peaks Unmoved, or lightly pace the shore When deep to deep in fury speaks, And lightnings flash and thunders roar, May well unmoved continue still In temples built by mortal hand, Where choicest architectural skill Combines the graceful with the grand; But they who, wheresoe'er hath been Their path, have that in reverence trod, And in and on it felt and seen The impress of the hand of God, Will with profounder awe subdued Within time-hallow'd temples tread, And feel with loftier faith imbued By that dim presence of the dead. So thought I, when that Churchyard's bound Approaching,âwith a chilling shock Of baffled hope the gate I found Close fasten'd with a ponderous lock. Immur'd like cloister'd maidenhood,â A spring shut up, a fountain seal'd,â The beauteous Church forbidden stood,â Its loveliness but half reveal'd. No foot of man, no reverent glance Might penetrate the shrine within,â Beneath its shadow to advance Seem'd counted as a deadly sin. Six days a week the churchyard lay, And half the seventh, by human tread Untouch'dâno living foot might stray Beside the mansions of the dead. Ah! why?âthis stormy, earthly life Of fear and hope, of toil and care, Might find from all its fret and strife Sometimes a moment's refuge there; Amidst the graves awhile be taught Remembrance that the flesh must die; Within the Church awake the thought Of the soul's immortality. This surely were no mortal crime, No taint of Babylonish leaven, No bondage dark to place or time, No wrong ascent from earth to heaven. Why needless barriers interpose Eternity and time between? Why thus the gate of entrance close To intercourse with things unseen? Such questions soon fit answer found;â Time was, by some scarce yet forgot, When, even within this holy ground, The world's worst spirit rested not. Strange custom!âeven amidst the graves Which most irreverent feet would spare,â Where now at will the spear-grass waves, Was heldâan annual cattle-fair. Almost beneath the sacred roof Was heard the bleat of herds and flocks; The tombs by the regardless hoof Were trampled of the horse and ox; And recklessly into the ground Their stakes and poles the rustics drave, And coffins oft unearth'd were found, And scatter'd relics of the grave. Strange legacy from days of old, When monks of Benedictine rule Within the Church-enclosure sold Their calves and lambs, their corn and wool. Strange legacy for years to keep, When friar and monk, black, white and grey, Before the Reformation's sweep Had pass'd like feverish dreams away; When even the Abbey Church itself, The nave destroy'd, scarce saved its choir, And rent and tithe became the pelf Of courtier-lord and country squire. What marvel, if at last the wrath Of outraged feeling, fierce though late, Closed up the desecrated path And lock'd the too commodious gate? Between extremes our human mind Will vacillate and waver long, And late at last, if ever, find The path of right 'twixt wrong and wrong. But hush!â'tis now no part of mine To meditate a moral lay,â To search for clouds, when sunbeams shine,â To preachâwhen first 'tis time to pray. The Sunday skies were bright and blue, The Sunday chimes rang blithely near,â To poet's eye how dear that view!â How sweet that music to his ear! And gaily dress'd in all their best, The children of the Sunday-school By looks and words and ways express'd Experience of their pastor's rule. And at the stated service-time A congregation full and grave, Beneath that abbey roof sublime, Intoned the chaunt and droned the stave. And from the altar, loud and clear, My trumpet-tones roll'd out and rang, And serious hearts were touch'd to hear, And choral voices swell'd and sang. And from the pulpit slowly down Returning, when my text was spun, I felt 'twixt me and that old town A new relationship begun. VII.âTHE CURATE AT HOME. There's something in a cloister's bound, And something in a convent cell; If not in sense, at least in sound, The words ring clear and jingle well; But nought exists so pure, so sweet, Within the wide expanse of earth, As love and learning's joint retreatâ The English pastor's home and hearth. The dear constraint of household ties, The daily kiss of wife and child, The love which gushes to the eyes From springs of feeling undefiled;â The round of duties blithely run, Where each and all their parts fulfil, Like stars revolving round the sun In their appointed orbits still;â The frugal, yet convivial meal, At which familiar faces throng,â The health which looks and limbs reveal,â The morning task, the evening song;â The prayer and praise at morn and night, For blessings shared, for sins forgivenâ These make the pastor's dwelling bright With gleams as of approaching Heaven. Thus in the curate's home I felt, When, from the shrine where Christians pray Return'd, with him and his I dwelt, And shared their meals that pleasant day. The kindness of the home-bred heart, The natural manners, frank and free, The simple tastes unspoilt by art, The true old English courtesy,â The evening walk with sire and child, By river bank, o'er hill and dale, Through which her song, abrupt and wild, Trill'd out the unwearied nightingale,â The after melody more high, And scarce less sweet, of household hymn, And anthems soaring to the sky As on the wings of seraphim;â Such pleasures that sweet Sunday crown'd,â A Sunday such as Christians love Whose hearts on earth by faith have found The key-note of the songs above. VIII.âTHE BOUDOIR. Small praise from me shall e'er be won For virtues of conventual life; I rank the most seraphic nun Below the least seraphic wife. Nor doth my fancy much incline (For all that hath been sung or said Of celibacy's life divine) To ancient bachelor or maid: But this I will at least maintainâ That of the last two kinds there be, Each unlike each, in growth and grain, As crab to golden-pippin tree. The former is a virgin still, Against her once decided voice; The latter, of her free good will, Unmated by deliberate choice. The former's prospects have been marr'd By fortune's trick or lover's slight; She sees and feels herself debarr'd From what she deems her sex's right. By disappointment thus devour'd, What marvel, if her heart be sear'd, Her judgment warp'd, her temper sour'd Tow'rd all without or with a beard? The latter hath, at duty's call, Or haply by peculiar taste, Surrender'd freely woman's all, And let her beauty run to waste: She cheers a widow'd parent's life, She dries a widow'd brother's tears; Denied the gentle name of wife, She feels the mother's griefs and fears;â She dwells on earth as angels might, To self-denying labours given; Walking by faith and not by sight,â Her treasure and her heart in Heaven. And suchâif things are what they seem, And I my judgment rightly frame From signs externalâsuch I deem Mine hostess wasâthat ancient dame. At eighty-six to be alive, Nor yet exempt from earthly care,â With those who fail and those who thrive, Their sorrows and their joys to share,â For social converse to retain A ready wit, a cheerful tongueâ To feel, in pleasure and in pain, Alike for middle-aged and young;â This speaks at least a genial heart,â A heart which nature soothes and stirs; Which still in this world bears its part,â And such a heart, I deem, was hers. My morning walk had made me late, And she the household prayers had read, Before at breakfast, tÃªte-a-tÃªte, We brake the absent Vicar's bread. Nor, though infirm and bent of frame, Would she from courteous pains forbear: That breakfast might have put to shame Full many a younger matron's care. But when 'twas doneââ'tis time,â quoth she, âThat on your kindness I presume, To ask if you will come and see My own peculiar, private room.â And, slow of step, she led the way With all the stately pride of age, To where her prized dominions lay,â A grave, majestic pilgrimage. The passages which thither led Were lined with books on either side, Which if she read not or she read, 'Tis not my province to decide; But this I may with truth averâ That she possess'd a mine of lore Which scholar or philosopher Possessing need demand no more. And shelf on shelf, and case by case, Her chamber walls were furnish'd round, Where each its own appointed place, Octavo, quarto, folio, found. Nor there was wanting sofa soft, Nor ottoman, nor trim settee; Floorâwindowsâwalls-beneathâaloft,â The room was snug as snug could be. And jars of china costly-quaint Fill'd up each vacant space and span, 'Midst portraits grim of sage and saint, And cabinets of rich japan. And many a tale of times gone by, And many a gentle boast had she, Of relics saved from ruin nigh,â The glories of her ancestry,â Of heirlooms still preserv'd with care From countless generations back; Poor gauds, which avarice deign'd to spare, When house and land had gone to wrack. And then, with graceful pride she told How, still herself unwedded, she Had nursed, from youth until grown old, The hopes of half her family;â And how, to her protecting arm, Entrusted from their very birth, Had infants been preserv'd from harm, To fill a prosperous place on earth. Strange mixture did her speech betray Of strength and weakness,âbut to me Celestial light appear'd to play From out that fond garrulity. Bright flashes fell upon the page Of future life, whereby 'twas shown How even the feeblest days of age Have joy and comfort of their own. I seem'd admonish'd not to fear, As fear'd I have, my own decay, When health and strength shall disappear, And mind's last vigour fade away. But still, the heart-springs to refresh By exercise of faith and love, Secure that fainting soul and flesh Shall be supported from above. IX.âTHE CURATE ABROAD. A train, not due till half-past one, Defined the limit of my stay; So, that grave conference past and done, Four vacant hours before me lay; And though my host was hardly press'd By work among the sick and old, And much himself had need of rest From Sunday labours manifold,â For no remonstrance I could urge Would he his courteous task forego, But from his study must emerge The wonders of the land to show. So, staff in hand, we sallied forth, And o'er the uplands clomb our way, Where East and West, and South and North, A world of gorgeous beauty lay. The Breadon's green and grassy steep On the left hand the prospect closed, And like a Titaness asleep The ridge of Malvern, as seen from some points of view, bears a considerable resemblance to a gigantic female figure recumbent sidelong, the head reposing on the extended arm. Huge Malvern on the right reposed. And far around, and in between, Lay wood and water, rock and lea, And blossoms hid the orchard green With promise rich of fruit to be. So fair a scene,âso calm, so bright, Might well entrance the outward eye, And with contemplative delight The inward vision satisfy. But on that pleasant morning walk Were other charms than Nature's shed; Grave thought was ours and earnest talk,â Full intercourse of heart and head. A traveller had the curate been On many a foreign sea and shore, Much had he read, much had he seen,â A man of multifarious lore. With keen, attentive eye had view'd The characters and minds of men, And trains of sober thought pursued, Beyond a superficial ken. But still, whate'er he did or said, One settled purpose you might see In every act and word betray'd,â To spread the truth which makes us free. Through praise and blame, through gain and loss, Through every form of good and ill, He seem'd a soldier of the cross, Undaunted and unwearied still: With steadfast persevering toil, Wrought in his own peculiar sphere, And till'd a poor, ungrateful soil, From month to month, from year to year; Yet still, with comprehensive glance, Survey'd all fields of Christian war,â Watch'd truth's embattled host advance, And cheer'd its onset from afar: In speech ablaze with heavenly fire, The cause of missions loved to plead, And urged, with zeal which nought could tire, The claims of our colonial need. A man of thought and action too, Even to grey hairs from earliest youth,â A pastor, such as earth hath few, In word and tongue, in deed and truth. So, side by side, in earnest talk, We two o'er hill and valley strode, Till, with our words and with our walk, Together soul and body glow'd. But feeble all, beside that heart Of energy and zeal sublime Appear'd the bard's inventive art,â The skill to weave fantastic rhyme. Rebuked before a manlier thought The poet's gaudy fancy bow'd; The teacher must himself be taught, The preacher less than ever proud. We finish'd our pedestrian round,â Such walks must needs take long to tire, And stood once more on holy ground, Within the grand old Abbey choir. Each crypt and cloister, arch and wall, Did we with curious eyes explore; The tombs and tablets, one and all, The brasses on the transept floor. Then, having snatch'd a swift repast, (For now the time was waxing late, And railway trains run far and fast,) The one-horse chaise was at the gate. And after words of brief adieu To matron and to maiden-kind, The tower receded fast from view,â Town, river, hills, were left behind. We parted at the station-door, (That stalwart-hearted priest and I,) Perchance on earth to meet no more,â And cordial was our last good-bye. And homeward as I fleetly sped, I marvell'd in the train, alone, How noblest hearts are born and bred To live and die in spheres unknown. And then I thought how tower and stream Had suddenly become to me No more a dim romantic dream, A freak of youthful phantasy; But a staid home for sober thought, O'er which remembrance still might brood,â A new-found joy, which came unsought In life's declining lustihood. And well I knew, when (home return'd,) I ponder'd my excursion o'er, That in and through it I had earn'd A treasure not possess'd before. THE KING'S QUARTERS. Forty years were gone and past With their pleasures and their pains, Since (a boy) I look'd my last On those verdant hills and plains, On that old manorial hall, On that clump of fir-trees tall; On that stately avenue, With its broad umbrageous trees, Huge in girth and dark of hue, Haunted by the evening breeze; On those smooth and spacious lawns Glistening in the dewy dawns; On those ancient ponds without, On those pictur'd walls within, Where, in merry Christmas rout, Congregated kith and kin; Uncles, aunts, and madcap cousins, Mix'd with neighbouring folk by dozens; On those garden-walls, where oft Itch'd my childish palm to reach, As they blush'd and bloom'd aloft, Ripening nectarine, plum and peach; On that hothouse, filled with grapes, Cluster'd in such luscious shapes; On the tiny church hard by, Scarce beyond the shrubbery bound; On the spring which sparkled nigh, Bubbling up from under-ground; Clear alike in sun and rain, Though of red chalybeate stain. âForty years are gone and past,â Few perchance may yet remain,â Shall I see that house at last? Shall I tread those courts again?â Like a weak distrustful elf Thus I reason'd with myself. âShall I break the life-long charm Which hath held it in my heart, Far from all alloy or harm Of the daylight world apart: Treasur'd with each holiest thought From the depths of memory brought? âAge hath its own fairy land Of remember'd hope and joy; Shall the man reverse the wand Which enchanted once the boy? Is it meet that fleshly eye Into those domains should pry? âHaply I may find them changed,â Every feature maim'd and marr'd, All their order disarranged, From saloon to stable yard; Scarce a vestige haply trace Of the old heart-cherish'd place. âOr, if all should yet remain Undismantled, undefiled, As the image on my brain Stamp'd while I was yet a child,â Its new tenants may not be Souls that care for mine or me. âIll could I endure to pace That enchanted ground, and feel That an unfamiliar face Followed frowning at my heel; That o'er all the loved domain Uncongenial spirits reign. âGrant I come a welcome guest, Free at will to rove and range,â Yet I know my brain and breast Both have undergone a change: Scenes to me can be no more What they were in days of yore. âMost of those beneath the mould Sleep whom here my childhood knew; I myself am grown too old Earliest feelings to renew: Why should I to life recall Thoughts so long grown painful all? âWhy with rash advance confound Worlds which cannot coalesce? Why obtrude on tenderest ground Waning life's impassiveness? While the present fades so fast, Let the past remain the past. âBetter dream my ancient dream Than dissolve, with sudden glare Of the sun's meridian beam, Aught so fragile yet so fair; Childhood's visions are to me Now the best reality.â With my heart I held debate, Thus o'er-mastering pro with con; Tow'rds the well-remember'd gate While my steps moved on and on; Unconvinced by argument Thither soul and body went. Up the avenue I pass'dâ Trees well known were yet alive,â Reach'd the gabel'd front at last,â Cross'd the trimly-gravell'd drive; Paused a momentâpull'd the bell,â That at once dissolved the spell. That old mansion is no more, Nor again can ever be Flush'd and flooded o'er and o'er With the tints of phantasy; Auld Lang Syne hath past away, 'Tis a treasure of to-day. In my mind's retentive eye, Long 'twas fill'd with faces, hid Where no fleshly gaze may pry,â Underneath the coffin-lid;â Spectral forms which in my brain Rose and sank and rose again. Let the dead embrace the dead, They with us their work have done; Lightly near the graves we tread Which received them one by one: Time will come when they and we Shall once more companions be. But the dwellers where they dwelt, Though of distant, alien birth, Feel as once our kindred felt,â Let them fill their place on earth; Better is the cordial host Than the gaunt ancestral ghost. Better friendly looks and tones, Mirth and song and social glee, Than a mouldering heap of bones,â Though revered as bones can be; Better woman's living grace Than the relics of a race. Pleasant was the image wrought By remembrance on my brain, But a brighter than I brought Bear I from that house again;â Image pure of household love, Peace on earth and hope above. Yet the older vision still All unfaded doth abide,â House and garden, grove and hill, Not transform'd, but glorified; Hall and chambers, gallery, stair, Still precisely what they were. But in me, since childish years, Hath a sense develop'd been, Seized by which the place appears Bright with more celestial sheen: What felt I of beauty then?â 'Tis not caught by childish ken. Now I know what glory floods Sun-illumined slope and hill; What the grandeur of the woods, What the music of the rill; See how fair is many a spot, Even to eyes which love it not. But the master-charm of all Flows not from the beauty seen In the old romantic hall, In its gardens trim and green, In the pastoral hills which bound All its fair horizon round,â Nor from rooms wherein of yore Princes play'd their boyish games, Nor from wainscots scribbled o'er By the second Charles and James, While their sire in arm'd array Did his siege to Gloucester lay; Nor from monumental brass, Still recording on the wall How King George the Third did pass Once a morning in the hall, With princesses young and fair, Racing up and down the stair;â Not from these, but from the thought Of the worth which lives there yet,â Of a pleasure found unsought, When my sun began to set; Not, I trust, to pass away While the spirit warms the clay. STANZAS AT THE STATION. Long time in the refreshment-room I stay'd Resign'd, expecting the North-Western train, By some mischance beyond its time delay'd; The day was drizzly, and continuous rain By turns abated and increased again; Throng'd was the platform with impatient folk Fretting like souls in purgatorial pain, As sinners will, at what might saints provoke,â For sure to wait so long was something past a joke. But among all, one party fix'd my eye,â Three of one household, as a babe might guess;â A grey-hair'd man, whose summer had gone by, A lady middle-aged, whose air and dress Became her ripe and mellow loveliness; Both these by turns a sprightly girl of three From time to time did playfully caress, Or, wild with spirits, bound from knee to knee,â A fine and healthful child as you on earth might see. The father and the husband (such I ween That stranger was, although indeed the pair Might, from the ripeness of their age, have been The parents' parents of that fairy fair) Seem'd one who communed with some secret care, So absent and abstracted was his look,â And ever and anon he left his chair, Closing the unread pages of his book, And through or round the room some restless paces took. And then, as though awaking from a dream, He stopp'd, and, seated by the lady's side, Gazed on herâne'er did eyes more fondly beam Of youthful bridegroom upon youthful bride, While she look'd up serenely, languid-eyed, Yet smiling, even like one who would conceal Some anxious thought, suppress'd with matron pride, Or which to him she dreaded to reveal, Lest he, her trouble known, a deeper still might feel. Meanwhile her fingers wrought, with busy haste, A curious web of network light and fine;â Some masterpiece of female skill and taste, Which with correct precision to defineâ Is not for muse so ignorant as mine; But she there-through her glowing needle drove In many a labyrinthine twist and twine, As though in woman's earnest speed she strove To finish some choice gift of woman's dearest love. Her looks, her work, the paleness of her cheek, Her husband's restless step and eye of gloom Suffused with love, to me appeared to speak Of some unknown, inexorable doom Threatening the parent's age, the daughter's bloom; 'Tis plain, thought I,âsome emigrant is he, Who goes, his life's poor remnant to consume In distant climes, no more for years to see His wife's heart-thrilling glance, his child's heart-cheering glee. And that choice handiwork of hers, no doubt, Is for a keepsake of connubial love, Which he shall cherish while his life wears out, Or till, in this world or the world above, He may rejoin his lost domestic dove.â Thus did I muse in speculative vein,â But, while her flimsy mesh-work fancy wove, The railway-bell announced the coming train, And straight the lady rose, like one who moved with pain. She walk'd, supported on her husband's arm, And then by chance the cloak was drawn aside, Which had before enwrapt her close and warm,â Whereat I noted, too observant-eyed, What did the question of my thought decide;â At once I saw the cause of all the fears By which the husband's restless heart was torn, Which filled the mother's eyes with natural tears, Not, haply, wont to flow in life's more vigorous years. So, in Wordsworthian humour, I began Straightway to frame and fancy in my mind The thoughts which might have stirr'd that grey-hair'd man, As one of common passions with his kind;â Thoughts which the curious here set down may find In phrase whereby I deem'd he might express, To her whose life was with his own entwined, What 'twas that wrought his spirit that distress, And fill'd his gazing eyes with such sad tenderness. âOnce again hath sickness bound thee With its sharp, corroding chain, Anxious fears once more surround thee, Wakeful nights and days of pain: And the months roll onward slowly, While thy burden heavier grows; What shall charm thy melancholy? What shall give thy heart repose? âHe who else were bound to renderâ What to render were delightâ Ministrations kind and tender To thy weakness day and night, When the East with sunrise burneth To his labour must be gone,â Seldom to thy side returneth Till the evening star hath shone. âMany a task of household duty Wearily must thou pursue, Chiefly cheer'd by childhood's beauty, And its spirit fond and true: Firm of heart and much enduring, Though in weakness and unrest, Still thy courage re-assuring With the thoughts which nerve it best. âThink how oft in years departed Thou the self-same chain hast worn, Feeble, fainting, anxious-hearted, Till to earth a child was born: Think what high protection nerved thee Through thy peril and thy pain; Think how strong an arm preserved thee,â Will it not preserve again? âThink how rich the compensation For thy anguish still hath been; How, for months of sore vexation, Years of gladness thou hast seen: Think how precious is the treasure Which beneath thy bosom lies; How profound the after pleasure Which thy present suffering buys. âNote yon tricksy prattler's gambols,â All her mischief,âall her play, As from room to room she rambles, Ever restless, ever gay. Swift as thought her antics vary, Stout is she of heart and limb, Frolicsome as forest fairy, Loving as the seraphim. âStrange and startling are her questions, Apt and quaint her quick replies; With instinctive, prompt suggestions Nature makes her passing wise. Still you trace, in voice and feature, Dawning thought and fancy wild,â Yet the gay and graceful creature Is a simple-hearted child. âCalculate the price which bought her,â All the sickness, anguish, fear; Wilt thou say so sweet a daughter Cost a single pang too dear? Wilt thou not for such anotherâ âSon or daughter, as may beâ Bear the burden of a mother, With a mother's constancy? âLet confiding expectation Chase the shades of grief and gloom; Bid prophetic speculation Guess what treasure fills thy womb. Could'st thou know what store of gladness, Day by day, is gathering there, Haply 'twould convert thy sadness Into bliss too great to bear. âHaply now thou bear'st within thee Comfort for thy widow'd years; Joy which shall hereafter win thee From thy troubles and thy tears; Firm support to help and hold thee Down the slope of life's decline; Loveâwhose fond embrace shall fold thee When by death divorced from mine. âPrecious gifts, and rich in blessing, Are the children of our age; Joys which mock not the possessing E'en of life's concluding stage. Though divergent paths bereave us, Of our elder, earlier born, These, we trust, will never leave us, Since our evening is their morn.â ANTICIPATION AND EXPERIENCE. When hope was young and fancy bright, And fond anticipation Embraced long years of pure delight, Unmarr'd by one vexation; When all the coming joys of life In vision lay before meâ The cheerful home, the charming wife, The children that she bore me; The whole domain of hopes and fears On which my dreams were founded, Within a certain term of years Was circled in and bounded. I saw myself at twenty-five A fond and fervent lover, And then my matrimonial hive With honey running over. I saw, when five more years had sped O'er smooth, untroubled waters, Round, dimpled cheeks of white and redâ The cheeks of sons and daughters. I saw the winter eve set in, The hearth burn bright and ruddy, The wind shut out, the warmth shut in,â How cozy look'd my study! The children all were warm in bed, Beside me sat their mother; We play'd, we sang, we wrote, we read, We laugh'd with one another. And years on years roll'd gaily on, (So seem'd it in my vision,) Until life's early prime was gone,â Yet still 'twas allâElysian. The world with joys remain'd alive, With which few griefs were blended, Until I came to thirty-fiveâ And there the vision ended. No spring of fancy could avail That barrier to leap over; What lay beyond it,âhill or dale,â No guess-work could discover. 'Twas like the tracts which maps contain'd, Ere geographic science Such knowledge of our globe had gain'd As might command reliance. âHere deserts spread, where snakes abound So huge, they scare beholders; Here anthropophagi are found With heads below their shoulders.â Thus strangely, wildly, fancy wrought, Life's distant page confusing, Until it barr'd prospective thought And baffled hope's perusing. So, pent within her narrow bound, Still dwelt anticipation, And built on safe and solid ground Her home and habitation. Experience came,âthe dreams of youth, So daintily ideal, Were found less bright than sober truth,â The fancied than the real. Young manhood pass'd,âgrave middle age Approach'd, arrived, departed; Life happier seem'd, at every stage, Than when the last was started. The joys, which fancy's glass had shown, Proved sweeter when I found them, And others, which she ne'er had known, With tenfold glory crown'd them. And though with joys came griefs and fears, Awhile their light obscuring, That light dissolved the mist of tears, And proved the more enduring. And now, long past the utmost bound Of life's foreseen fruition, I find more bright the realm around, More blest my own condition. The slanting lights more softly shine Than day's meridian splendour, And grief is soothed by life's decline, And joy becomes more tender. And dearer far is wedlock's bond Than when we learnt to bear it, And household love is thrice as fond, Though many more must share it. There's scarce a joy of life's young prime But still retains its station, While yearly from the womb of Time Comes forth a new creation. Ah me! could this for ever last!â This truce with mortal sorrow!â I listen for the rising blast Of storms to burst to-morrow. I miss the scourge which smites me not, Albeit too sorely needed, As though I were a child forgot, Unnoticed and unheeded. Nay, doubt not, fear notâbless thy God, Whose love forbears to pain thee; Whose arm withholds the chastening rod, Whose silken cords constrain thee. Believe that since experience, still Outstripping expectation, Doth more than all the dream fulfil Of young anticipation, The mercy which hath been thy guide Through paths so smooth and pleasant, A future also shall provide Still brighter than thy present. Old age thou deem'st both grim and grey, Beset with pain and sorrow;â His face, which seems to frown to-day, Shall beam with smiles to-morrow. And death, if thou wilt bravely wait On the behests of duty, Approaching, shall unbar the gate To realms of endless beauty. LOVERS AT LOGGERHEADS. What have I to do with theeâ Thee, Caprice's wilful daughter, That to mate thee I must be Steering thus through stormy water? What need I, an elder, care Whether fools be foes or spouses, Meddling, marring here and thereâ Plague say I o' both your houses. Vestry brawls are rude and rough,â Who but Vestry chairman pities? Workhouse boards torment enough, Worse torment one school committees; But to me the toil of toils, Hardestâay! full ten times overâ Is to soothe the raging broils Of a loved one with a lover. Lo! upon my study shelves, When on such affairs I ponder, Sage and scholar bless themselves, Theologians watch and wonder. Hooker, Hammond, Taylor, Mede, Basil, Ambrose, Athanasiusâ All pronounce the life I lead Inconceivably vexatious. Whence the spell which thus enchains Me, a grave and prudent rector? Has Queen Mab bewitched my brains? Have I quaff'd Olympian nectar? Nayâto speak prosaic senseâ All the charm is purely human;â 'Tis the generous confidence Of a noble-hearted woman. THE WORLD WELL LOST. So it is done, and thou hast chosen The good, the wise, the prudent part, Ere Fancy's wild unrest had frozen The well-springs of thy woman's heart. And thou canst bid farewell for ever To joys which were thy life of life; Exchange the artist's high endeavour For the calm duties of the wife; In self-denying strength of heart Canst turn from plaudits long and loud,â The triumphs of thy much-loved art,â The homage of the admiring crowd,â From what thou didst more dearly prize, The silence of the thoughtful few,â The tears which from discerning eyes The magic of thy genius drew,â Yea, even from Fancy's bright domain, (That realm which thou didst range at will;â Thy refuge long from care and pain, Thy harbour in all storms of ill,)â From thisâfrom all which years had made Thy own especial home to theeâ Thou turn'stâto dwell beneath the shade Of Love's profound reality. Even in thy pride and prime of power (The rightful power of mind o'er mind) Forgo'st thy nature's queenly dower And leav'st lamenting realms behind. Well hast thou done; ay! wisely well, Nor unrewarded shalt thou be, That thou didst not, through pride, rebel Against thy better destiny. For all which to thy wondrous art Its charm of moral grandeur lentâ Thy true nobility of heart,â Thy fervour of sublime intent,â Thy sense of duty, strong and clear As in thy great Taskmaster's eye,â All this with tenfold light shall cheer The stillness of thy privacy. And thou wilt tame thy spirit down (That spirit of ethereal mould) From graspings at world-wide renown, To household duties manifold: And thine shall be no eagle's nest, But a calm dwelling, like the dove's,â A home which âthat sweet summer guest The temple-haunting martletâ loves. And there shalt thou, with book and pen, And studious thought, and letter'd ease, And converse high of gifted men, And bright-eyed children round thy knees,â And moreâO! how much more than all,â A husband's deep, devoted love, A happiness too pure to pall,â The fulness of contentment, prove. Will this suffice thee?âhath thy heart No loftier cravings to allay? Wilt thou be satisfied a part All earthy and of earth to play? Is this domestic, social range Of sympathies and hopes and fears, For all past joys a full exchange,â A portion for all future years? Ah! no:âthough earth around look bright, Thy soul must yearn and struggle still For calmer peace, for purer light, For perfect rest of thought and will. And many a dream must still be thine Of better, brighter worlds to come;â Of some fair land where love divine Gladdens the soul's eternal home. And one thou hastâhimself, like thee, A pilgrim towards that peaceful land,â Who shall thy true companion be, And with thee seek it hand in hand; With thee the hidden depths explore Of Heaven's unfathom'd love and light; With thee from Time's receding shore Launch forth into the infinite; With thee, in lowliness of heart, Fix a devout, enquiring eye On mysteries which we know in part, And which in part we prophesy; Till what was but in part be past, And what is perfect, fully known, And faith transformed to sight at last, And Heaven's deep secrets all our own. A WORD TO THE WEDDED. O deem not that is love unfeign'd, Which no minute offence can brook, But tries, with rigour overstrain'd, Each hasty word, each passing look; Which counts as nothing half a life Of past attachment, deep and strong, When weigh'd against a moment's strife, A moment's unintended wrong. And deem not that to quench the flame Of wedded love's impassion'd glow, By words of harsh rebuke and blame For some rash act done long ago,â To ransack memory's secret store For deeds and words, and looks and tones, And moods and humours, past and o'erâ Poor frailties, which the heart disowns;â O! deem not that to taunt with these The aching heart, which loves thee still, Can give thy own vex'd spirit ease, Or work the offender's aught but ill. The passing word of spite or spleen,â The temper all too quickly moved,â The tart reply,âthe sarcasm keen Between the loving and the loved;â These at the spirit's surface lie,â Its secret depths sleep calm below, Where love hears not the gusts pass by Which o'er the ruffled surface blow. But when offended memory brings, With close, tenacious grasp, to light All hateful, all unhappy things, Best buried in sepulchral night,â When faults in human frailty wrought Are dealt with as of hate prepense, Conceiv'd in cool, deliberate thought, And acted but to give offence,â Then, then indeed, o'er Hymen's bower Love flutters his departing wings, And old enchantments lose their power, And scorn and anger ply their stings. O trifle not with holiest ties, Nor rouse the slumbering fiend of ill; Be patient, generous, timely wise,â And rule him, soul and body, still. HESPEROTHEN. You ask me for a gift in rhyme,â Some faint memorial of the power Which graced your father's golden prime, When hope and life were both in flower: And fain would I, my son, indite A strain, as sweet, as kind and true As Poet-father e'er could write To son as dearly loved as you. Fain would I breathe into my lay The deep regret, the fond desire Of that bright face so far away Which sets our yearning hearts on fire, And make you feel, if that might be, How father, mother, sister true, Brother and youthful friend agree In longing and in love for you. Vain longingâand as vain regret!â Between us ocean rolls and raves, And many a year must vanish yet, Or ere upon its dancing waves The ship that bears our lost one home Her white and welcome wings unfold,â Ah!âlong before that day shall come Must many a loving heart be cold. And you, my son, are weak and faint, And from that fierce and fiery clime Perchance even now imbibe a taint Still deadlier than the touch of Time: And he, with swift, insidious flight, Already steals our strength away,â Already dims your father's sight, And turns your mother's tresses grey. God knows if in this world below We shall again behold our son; God help us, if our tears must flow,â To say indeedâHis will be done!â God cherish, in our hearts and yours, Feeling and thought which will not die,â The love which strengthens and endures, When faith and hope are both gone by. Meanwhile do thoughts âtoo deep for tearsâ Full oft oppress your father's mind, Of angry words in earlier years, Of hasty words and looks unkind, Of passion feebly held in check, Of sharp rebuke and sudden blow,â Till he would fall upon your neck And let his swelling heart o'erflow. And, more than this, remembrance tells Of that which is my nature's bane,â The shy reserve which shuts the cells Of feeling in my heart and brain; The fetters which lock up my tongue When it should speak on things divine To craving hearts of old and young,â The hearts which are most dearly mine. For thisâfor all of past offenceâ For wrong committed, right not done, Through rashness or through negligence, Forgive your father, O my son: Both he and you, for many a debt, Have too much need to be forgiven By Him whose mercy spares us yet,â Our Fatherâyours and mineâin Heaven. No more!âyet take the printed tomes With this imperfect utterance sent;â They breathe of English hearths and homes, Of wedded peaceâof heart-content; Of all which, in the morn of life, My fond imagination prized; All which, in children, home and wife, My riper years have realized. And some few loftier notes there be Those earthly melodies among,â Half feeling, and half phantasy,â Weak yearnings for diviner song: O! to your father's lyric art May power and might through these be given To wake in your responsive heart The music and the mind of Heaven! And may your inward ear discern The ground-tone of my varying strain, And still from mine your spirit learn To prize the pleasure and the pain Of wedded life, of wedded love, Of faith in higher bliss to be,â Of peace on earthâof hope above For Time and for Eternity! VIOLETS. âUnder the green hedges, after the snow, There do the dear little violets grow; Hiding their modest and beautiful heads Under the hawthorn in soft mossy beds.â âSweet as the roses, and blue as the sky, Down there do the dear little violets lie; Hiding their heads where they scarce may be seen, By the leaves you may know where the violet hath been.â Such thy first notes, as of music from heaven, Child of my heart, when thy years were eleven; Still, at thirteen, my delight and my pride, Violet-hearted, forget-me-not-eyed. Blest be thy birth-day!âmore bountiful none Hath in our family calendar shone; Never was born to us child who hath proved Sweetlier-gifted, more dearly beloved. Pale is thy forehead, and paler thy cheek, Weak was thy infancy, still thou art weak; Fragile of body and feeble of limb,â But thine eyes in the spring-dew of phantasy swim. Deep in the cells of thy spirit are wrought Exquisite textures of feeling and thought; Forth from the depths of thy sensitive heart, Tears to thine eyelids will bubble and start. Oft, as thy fingers sweep over the keys, Melody stirs in thy soul like a breeze; Till the strong impulse evoke from the chords Fairy-like music, to fairy-like words. Oft, as thou walkest in meadow or wood, Over its treasure thy spirit will brood; Yearnings of nature, which nought can controul, Blossom and bud in thine innocent soul. Then, as thou fixest thine eyes on the ground, Heedless of all that is passing around, Deaf to their greetings, though cordial and kind,â Country-folk askââIs she right in her mind?â Right in thy mind?âay! and right in thy heart, Loving, and gentle, and pious thou art; Never hath dearer, more dutiful child, Grief from the heart of a parent beguiled. Tenderness, faithfulness, sweetness profound, Compass and clasp thee about and around; Others by magic of intellect move, Thine is the genius of goodness and love. Use, but abuse not, the blessing of song, Which from thy tuneful heart dances along; Force it notâcurb it notâfree let it flow Whither the breezes of Nature shall blow. Seek not, and shun not, the garland of fame, Keep thyself scatheless from praise and from blame; Care not what outwardly fancy may win, Fully content with her blessing within. Only be innocent, artless and good, Loving of spirit, and gentle of mood; Fear and serve God with devotion of heart, So shall He glorify all that thou art. So, whether vocal or silent thou be, Song shall be living in, welling from thee; If not the meed of the poetess thine, Thou shalt thyself be a poem. divine. SONNET. [Behold, my son, thy father's portraiture] Behold, my son, thy father's portraiture Traced by the fiery pencil of the sun, Even in our Northern clime through science won To rival art's fine touch, in hues obscure But truthful, and from that smooth flattery pure Through which the painter's work is oft misdone,â To thee, whose manhood scarce hath yet begun, A record of thy parent true and sure.â Alas! on thy bright cheek and fair white brow A sadder work will India's sun have wrought Ere we behold the vessel's home-bound prow That brings thee back, the darling of our thought. Changed will thy form be;âbetter changed art thou Through lore which faith hath learnt and God hath taught. SONNET. [Accept, dear wife, this new sixteenth of May] Accept, dear wife, this new sixteenth of May, My likeness, traced by photographic art, Of that the close and twin-born counterpart Sent to our son, who still elate and gay Beneath the scorching equatorial ray Keepeth, unchanged by counting-house or mart, The pure, fresh feelings of his English heart, While we, at home, grow trouble-worn and grey. Perchance hereafter, when the timely grave Hath closed o'er me, the husband and the sire, Shall ye, still parted by the ocean wave, Gaze on these features, and with vain desire Think at one hour of his past love who gave, And mourn his death-chill'd heart, his silent lyre. SONNET. [Sweet is the blossom'd promise of the spring] Sweet is the blossom'd promise of the spring, Its pleasant interchange of sun and showers, Its verdant herbage prank'd with star-like flowers, The cuckoo's note, the song which thrushes sing; Sweet too is summer, when the Zephyr's wing Fans the meridian heat (which else o'erpowers The fainting soul) and green umbrageous bowers Of thick-leaved boughs refreshing coolness bring; But sweeter, to discerning heart and eye, Is autumn with its fruitage ripe and red, Its foliage steep'd in many a gorgeous dye, Its waving cornfields rich in promised bread.â Such, dearest, is thine autumn;âwhy should I Grieve if thy summer, like thy spring, hath fled. SONNET. [Jeannie! I deem that this thy nuptial day] Jeannie! I deem that this thy nuptial day Should scarcely pass unhonour'd on my part By some small tribute of poetic art, Sonnet, or song, or hymeneal lay; Such as long since, while youth's luxuriant May Was blossoming and budding in my heart, Would from my pen, almost unbidden, start, As joy or sorrow prompted, grave or gay. But now 'tis life's October;âflower and leaf, Blossom and bud and fruit are dropp'd or dead;â Long garner'd hath been autumn's ripest sheaf, Nor should I wreathe to-day around thy head A faded garland, redolent of grief, Nor with dry stubble strew thy bridal bed. SONNET. 1839. [With no impatient or rebellious mind] With no impatient or rebellious mind Bear thy great sorrow, Lady, for in thee Is now fulfill'd the immutable decree, Whereby Eternal Wisdom hath assign'd, To those whom it selects of human-kind For special service, suffering, from which we, Less honour'd, are exempt. 'Twas thine to see A glorious spirit through thy love refined And purified for Heaven: O therefore bow, High-hearted woman, to His righteous will Who proves thy spirit with this anguish now, And patiently thy widow's task fulfil, Cheer'd, even on earth, by faith revealing still The amaranth crown upon thy husband's brow. SONNET. [Heaven bless thee, Lady! for two happy days] TO THE SAME. 1850. Heaven bless thee, Lady! for two happy days Of pure though sad, of deep though quiet feeling, A buried world within my heart revealing, Distinct, though dim, in memory's tender haze; Which when the introverted eye surveys, Blossoms burst forth from winter's dark concealing, Streams gush to life, which Time had been congealing, Light, long obscured, on soul and spirit plays. Heaven bless thee, Lady!âbless thy widow'd hearth!â Widow'd, not desolate, but gladden'd still By household smiles and girlhood's heartfelt mirth, Temper'd with grief which tames the chasten'd will, And disciplines the spirit, here on earth, Its work of lifelong duty to fulfil. THE THREE MINSTRELS. PROLOGUE. Small hopeâperchance small wish have I To leave a poet's name behind, Inscribed upon my country's mind In characters too deep to die. My genius is not of the brood Which spreads its wings and soars sublime Beyond the bounds of space and time, Nor have I well the Muses woo'd, Nor served them with a perfect heart, Still with such melody content As nature to my fingering lent, With scant appliances of art. Nor have I lack'd my full rewardâ The pleasure given to gentle minds,â The genuine sympathy which binds The souls of listener and of bard. If some half-conscious thirst for fame With simpler wishes hath been blent, Such have I won;âI am content Alive to bear the poet's name. What profit would be mine when dead From laurels planted round my grave? What injury, though fool or knave Should spurn it with contemptuous tread? If some chance words escape decayâ A thoughtâan image here and there, By gentle hearts preserved with care, When I from earth have past awayâ So be it; more is gain'd than sought; Meanwhile let me enjoy the good Which since my life's young lustihood Until its wane, the Muse hath brought; High friendshipsâsympathies benign From some who o'er the hearts of men Reign deathlessâminds of ampler ken And insight more profound than mine. Content with what I have and am, Nor envying them what they may be, This verse I consecrate to three Great spiritsââin memoriam.â THE FIRST MINSTREL. My freshman's year was past and done, I bore no undistinguish'd name, Nor all unknown to college fame, Through laurels in my boyhood won. With minds, the noblest of my day, My undergraduate lot was cast, In whose high friendship swiftly pass'd The seed-time of my life away. My mind, spell-bound beneath the strength Of Byron's genius in its prime, Was now, as wisdom came with time, Awaking from that dream at length. The growth of my expanding thought Assumed a manlier, healthier tone; Old idols had been overthrown, New shrines of adoration sought. And in my heart a voice was heard Fresh from the mountain and the lake, Which to its inmost spirit spake, And all its noblest pulses stirr'd. Then 'twas that to his brother's home, Who did our college sceptre sway,â 'Twas known that Rydal's bard, to pay A brother's debt of love, was come. And they who then revered his name, (As yet a small but zealous band) To welcome him with heart and hand Back to his Alma mater, came. One eveningâ(one to life's decline Since youth remember'd)â'twas my pride To sit, a listener, at his side Whom I had deem'd almost divine. He then had turn'd his fiftieth year,â Older in aspect than in age; And less of poet than of sage Methought did in his looks appear. His voice sonorous, clear and deep, With somewhat of a pompous tone; His locks, already silvery grown, Did scantly round his temples creep. His face and form were thin and spare As of ascetic anchorite, Yet with us boys in converse light He join'd, with free and genial air. And I remember that he told How once upon the Righi's height He stood, in clear, celestial light, While thunder-clouds beneath him roll'd, And thunder-peals roar'd long and loud, And lightnings, with their lurid glare, Lit up the crags abrupt and bare Which pierced the sable veil of cloud. And then did he discuss again A point, in verse discuss'd beforeâ Whether the nightingale doth pour A stormy or a tender strain. Themes both, which might have wakened then The poet soul,âyet nought he said Which much beyond the thought betrayed Of unimaginative men. Yet did his nervous words express Wisdom combined with vigorous sense, Nor lack'd that natural eloquence Which is the voice of earnestness. Utter'd by lips of common men, Not common had they seem'd to be,â Only they gave no sign that he Was lord of an immortal pen. And when that wish'd-for hour had flown, Almost my fancy might lament That now her glittering veil was rent, And all it had enshrouded, known. Beneath my roof again we met,â My years had then attained their prime; And he, though somewhat touch'd by time, Was hale and energetic yet. And he had left his mountain home To gladden and refresh his age, (So said he) by a pilgrimage To those eternal hills of Rome. His daughter, who her maiden name Not yet had merged in that of wife, The staff of his declining life, The partner of his travel came. With fervent, earnest words he spoke Of public morals, of the laws Which give the English labourer cause To fret beneath the social yoke; Of principles, both good and pure, Made false by legislative haste, For female virtue, sore debased, Attempting an empiric cure. And then, as with the sudden growth Of indignation, from his lip Some hasty words were heard to slip, Which sounded very like an oath. Thence to his own peculiar sphere He turn'dâthe wide domain of song, Pronouncing judgment clear and strong By laws fastidiously severe. No weak indulgence would he shew To fancies marr'd by careless haste,â Rank shoots of genius run to waste, Whose healthier growths are sure and slow; But urged that with elaborate toil All shapings of poetic thought Must be to ripe perfection brought, Or wither in the richest soil. In critic phrase I pleaded then For noble thoughts and words sublime, From verse of his in later time Expunged with a remorseless pen;â Marring, methoughtâas poets use, Whose evening star of fancy wanes While judgment domineers,âthe strains Which glorified his youthful muse. Thereto, in grave deliberate tone, But bland withal, he made reply, And spake of art severe and high, And duties which he deem'd his own: Of gifts not rashly to be marr'd, Of work not lightly to be done, Of power o'er human hearts, to none Vouchsafed but the laborious bard. Of what was to his country due, Of what he had received from Heaven, The task inspired, the talents given, The meed which he must needs pursue. He spake like one who feels the weight Of genius to his lot assign'd,â The burden of a mighty mind,â The debt incurred by being great; And while his voice sonorous roll'd, We felt as though a prophet spake, In words which drowsiest hearts might wake And render feeblest spirits bold. Once more we metâwhen years had fled,â Beside the banks of Windermere; He then was nigh his eightieth year, But vigorous still of voice and tread. Sorrow her perfect work had done Less on his body than his mind; On earth he now was left behind When those who made it bright were gone. And (last and most lamented) sheâ His dearest hopeâhis age's stay,â His daughter too had past away Ere death had set her father free; For months had he despondent lain, Stun'd by that overwhelming stroke, Then lately from his trance awoke To master and subdue his pain. Yet with a courteous, cordial air The aged poet met me still, And welcomed me, with free good will, To his sweet mountain dwelling there. His life was then the life of one Who after battle's long turmoil, (The victory won, secured the spoil,) Reposes when his work is done. No longer vext by hopes or fears, Or sense of duty unfulfill'd, While fame, well won, began to gild The sunset of his later years, Serenely the old man survey'd, As from a troubled ocean's shore, The tempests which for him were o'er, The tumult which the breakers made. In calm and philosophic mood He spake of past and present days, And now with censure, now with praise, The living and the dead review'd: But chiefly he his thoughts address'd To themes of high religious strain; Like one who from the care and pain Of earthly life would be at rest. Ere two years more o'er that grey head Had flown, both care and pain were past, And by his daughter's side at last The poet slumber'd with the dead. THE SECOND MINSTREL. This very month 'tis thirty years, (Ah why will years so swiftly flee,â I scarce believe them more than three, So short the by-gone time appears,)â Since we toward Highgate bent our way,â Three poetsâloving friends and true The skies had on their brightest blue, The air was fresh with fragrant hay. Scarce out of London's smoke and din We heard the mower whet his scythe, The summer birds were singing blithe, Like creatures without care or sin. And we, almost as blithe as they, (For life in us was fresh and strong,) With talk and jest and snatch of song Beguiled the progress of our way. One was a youth who clomb to fame By paths than song more swift and sure,â No soul less selfish or more pure Hath graced the senatorial name. The second hath, since ripening age, Been from the Muses haunts estranged, Through which in youth his genius rangedâ Its patrimonial heritage. A teacher such as earth hath few, Though, ill repaid and underprized, His greatness all unrecognised, His lifelong toil doth he pursue:â A fetter'd eagle, link on link He drags a soul-corroding chain, Too constant-hearted to complain, Too brave beneath his load to sink. Him, on that well-remember'd day, We others followed to the shrine Of wisdom and of song divine, The homage of young hearts to pay, And hear those wondrous lips unfold, In tones of inspiration high, Such truths as to prophetic eye In trance ecstatic are unroll'd. Blandly, our triple league to greet, The sage of tongue heaven-kindled came, Already of decrepit frame, Ill balanced on unsteady feet. He, by his clerkly, grave attire, A Christian pastor might have seem'd, But in his eye seraphic gleam'd Effulgence of celestial fire. We mark'd the broad expanse of brow, The prematurely silver hair, The streams of music rich and rare Which through those parted lips did flow. Awed by that mighty presence, I Was silent like a bashful child; But he, with condescension mild, And frank, ingenuous courtesy, His sovereignty awhile resign'd, And with a kind, familiar air, Subdued, to light which we could bear, The lustre of his inner mind. The hand of Retzsch had newly then On Goethe's art its own essay'd, And âFaustâ was on the table laid, The pencil vying with the pen. But touch'd with all pervading light, Which from that mystic mind did stream, The painter's and the poet's dream Were straight transfigured in our sight. On every page, on every line, Intense illumination play'd,â A glory not its own, which made What else seem'd devilish, half divine. And though 'twas mine, in later days, The inspiration of the seer In fuller, deeper flow to hear, And bask in more unclouded rays Emitted from that glorious orb,â Yet that one hour on Highgate hill Doth, o'er the rest remember'd, still My spirit's retrospect absorb. And still to me, by Goethe's pen Spell-bound, or Retzsch's living page, Comes back the memory of the sage Who steep'd them both in sunlight then. My youthful years had past away,â Again I stood beside his door,â The poet-soul was there no more,â Its empty frame unburied lay. In me it woke mysterious awe, To think that he, that lord of song, Had yielded, like the vulgar throng, To death's inexorable law: That light, not oft in ages sent,â Which yet had in the darkness shone Uncomprehended,ânow was gone For ever from our firmament. But ere that awe had lost its spell, 'Twas merged in sorrow more profound;â Beneath a distant churchyard mound Was laid a child beloved too well. Almost they parted side by side,â The babe whose days were scarce a span, And he, the hoary-headed man,â The sinless and the sanctified;â The sage profound in thought and lore, The child whose thought had scarce begun,â Both battles fought, both races run, Both landed on the eternal shore. Together at the Judgment throne Perchance they stood; and who shall say What difference then between them lay,â Which spirit had the riper grown: What, if at one triumphant bound The child in death may overleap The toilsome progress, long and steep, By which the man hath wisdom found? What, if the saint's long war with sin,â If all the study of the sage, From earliest youth to latest age, Renew not so the world within,â Nor so the spirit's range expand, Nor so illume its inward eye To view, in vision clear and nigh, The wonders of that unknown land,â As his whom pure baptismal grace, Still all unsoil'd as when 'twas given, Hath made unconscious heir of Heaven And fit to see his Father's face? THE THIRD MINSTREL. Not poor, nor profitless, I deem The homage paid, in deed and truth, By poet, in his morn of youth, To elders o'er the craft supreme. But that, methinks, becomes him more, Which, in his own declining day, He doth to those, his juniors, pay Who, coming after, rank before; Who still must wax as he must wane, Whose light shall burn and shine afar, When his, a pale and glimmering star, Hath faded into night again. A matron is my neighbour now, In childhood introduced to fame, By one who bears a deathless name And wreathes the laurel round his brow. And he beneath her roof sometimes Still tarries, as a kinsman ought; Refreshes there his weary thought, Or meditates harmonious rhymes. And thither, one fine winter day On premonition duly sent, As brother of the guild, I went My homage to our chief to pay. The snow lay thick on field and tree, The pools with ice were crusted o'er; Such snow as fell in days of yore, Such ice as now we seldom see. But veil'd in an ambrosial cloud, Secure from weather, as from fate, The poet in Olympian state Did his immortal presence shroud. Ah! Lillian! was't an act of grace In thee, retreating through the door, Two bards, who ne'er had met before, To leave alone and face to face? Perchance thou didst a hope sublime Indulgeâyea in thy soul believeâ That each the other's skull would cleave, And so the world be spared some rhyme. Thou deem'st the true Pierian swan Is but a bantam spur-bedight, More prompt with kindred fowl to fight Than unpoetic man with man. Not so,âthy guest, whose face I sought, Assumed a frank, familiar air, And with a volume of MoliÃ©re Our brains to mild encounter brought. We spake of England and of France, And how the individual man In England doth to ampler span, In well-developed growth, advance: And how to Shakespere's genius thus Did larger fields of thought abound Than could in all the world be found Elsewhere than only among us. That point decided once with care, To others as our talk diverged, Together rising, we emerged Into the fresh and frosty air: And he, a skater old and proved, Did o'er the ice, on trenchant heel, In labyrinthine mazes wheel, Like one who vigorous motion loved. Then, homeward as we shaped our way, Again we spake of books and men,â The ancient and the modern pen,â The Grecian, Roman, English lay; Of Himâthe Teacher true and bold, Till death, assail'd with bigot hate; Now throned among the good and great Of all earth's ages, new and old; And Himâas true and boldâwho still Through the same storm of earthly life, Malign'd, reviled, maintains his strife With error and with social ill. Racy and fresh was all he said, Not cramp'd by bonds of sect or school; He seem'd not one who thought by rule, Nor one of any truth afraid; But, bold of heart and clear of head, The course of human thought review'd, And dauntlessly his path pursued, To whatsoever goal it led. A man indeed of manly thought, Inhabiting a manly frame,â A man resolved, through praise or blame, To speak and do the thing he ought. Sometimes in phrase direct and plain, At which fastidious ears might start, He clothed the promptings of his heart, The strong conceptions of his brain; But in and o'er whate'er he said Ingenuous truth and candour shone; In every word and look and tone Was nobleness of soul display'd. And if perchance for form and creed Pugnacious less than some may be, Yet Christian eyes at once might see In him, a Christian bard indeed, And well may English hearts rejoice That queenly hands around the brow Of one so graced the laurel bough Have wreathed, as by a nation's choice. EPILOGUE. A fiddle is a paltry thing,â A thing of catgut and of wood; It does one's temper little good To hear a bungler scrape the string: But let a Paganini's hand Thereon its wondrous power essay, And lo! beneath that magic sway What worlds of melody expand! A master-touch but lately swept Some chords of elegiac tone, And woke to music all its own The spirit which within them slept. A feeble medium 'twas he chose,â An instrument of compass small; And yet from hut to palace hall The wondrous descant rang and rose. In plaintive murmurs, low and grave, It moan'd and murmur'd like the sea;â A solemn, deep monotony, Renew'd, repeated, wave on wave. Through England's utmost breadth and length It pass'dâthat melancholy strain, As of a noble soul in pain, Its sadness temper'd by its strength. The peasant heard it at his plough,â It smote the student in his cell,â Like balm on mourning hearts it fell,â The blithe were touched, they knew not how. What marvel if in some it found An echo which would fain prolong The rapture of so sweet a song,â The bliss of such unearthly sound? But strings which, touch'd by minstrel skill, Enchant the hearer's soul and sense, Twang'd by a clown's impertinence Are unmelodious catgut still. And yet perchance 'tis well to learn The limits of our proper skill,â The difference between power and will By sad experience to discern. And those methinks are less to blame Who mar a measure weak and mean Than those who put what might have been A noble harmony to shame. I knew not, when my song I plann'd, That this inverted stave required The music of a soul inspired, The magic of a master's hand; Nor dream'd that so minute a changeâ The transposition of a rhymeâ Could thus bewilder tune and time, Thus make expression harsh and strange. Howe'er it beâmy story told, This ill-strung fiddle I resign To fingers more expert than mine,â To souls of more melodious mould. And if my song discordant seem, Even let it perish, lost and drown'd In the full stream of golden sound Diffused by those harmonious Three. MUSÃ ETONENSES. Seed-time and harvest, summer's genial heat, And winter's nipping cold, and night and day Their stated changes, as of old, repeat, And must, until this world shall pass away; While nations rise, and flourish, and decay, And mighty revolutions shake the earth, Filling men's hearts with trouble and dismay; And war and rapine, pestilence and dearth, To many a monstrous shape of pain and woe give birth. But still, while states and empires wax and wane, And busy generations fret and die, The face of Nature doth unchanged remain; Small token is there in the earth or sky Of dissolution or mortality; But streams are bright, and meadows flowery still, And woods retain their ancient greenery, And shade and sunshine chequer dale and hill, Though all the abodes of men be rife with wrong and ill. There is no feature in thy fair domain Which of decay or change displays a trace, No charm of thine but doth undimm'd remain, O Thou my boyhood's blest abiding-place, While five-and-twenty years with stealthy pace Have cool'd thy son's rash blood, and thinn'd his hair;â The old expression lingers on thy face, The spirit of past days unquench'd is there, While all things else are changed, and changing everywhere. And through thy spacious courts, and o'er thy green Irriguous meadows, swarming as of old, A youthful generation still is seen, Of birth, of mind, of humour manifold: The grave, the gay, the timid, and the bold,â The noble nursling of the palace-hall,â The merchant's offspring, heir to wealth untold,â The pale-eyed youth, whom learning's spells enthral,â Within thy cloisters meet, and love thee, one and all. Young art thou still, and young shalt ever be In spirit, as thou wast in years gone by; The present, past and future blend in thee, Rich as thou art in names which cannot die, And youthful hearts already beating high To emulate the glories won of yore; That days to come may still the past outvie, And thy bright roll be lengthen'd more and more Of statesman, bard, and sage well versed in noblest lore. Ah! well, I ween, knew He what worth is thine, How deep a debt to thee his genius owed,â The Statesman, who of late, in life's decline, Of public care threw off the oppressive load, While yet his unquench'd spirit gleam'd and glow'd With the pure light of Greek and Roman song,â That gift, in boyish years by thee bestow'd, And cherish'd, loved, and unforgotten long, While cares of state press'd round in close, continuous throng. Not unprepared was that majestic mind, By food and nurture once derived from thee, To shape and sway the fortunes of mankind, And by sagacious counsel and decree Direct and guide Britannia's destinyâ Her mightiest ruler o'er the subject East: Yet in his heart of hearts no joy had he So pure, as when, from empire's yoke released, To thee once more he turned with love that never ceased. Fain would he cast life's fleshly burden down Where its best hours were spent, and sink to rest,â Weary of greatness, sated with renown,â Like a tired child upon his mother's breast: Proud may'st thou be of that his fond bequest, Proud that, within thy consecrated ground, He sleeps amidst the haunts he loved the best; Where many a well-known, once-familiar sound Of water, earth, and air for ever breathes around. Such is thine empire over mightiest souls Of men who wield earth's sceptres; such thy spell Which until death, and after death, controuls Hearts which no fear could daunt, no force could quell: What marvel then, if softer spirits dwell With fondest love on thy remember'd sway? What marvel, if the hearts of poets swell, Recording at life's noon, with grateful lay, How sweetly in thy shades its morning slipped away? Such tribute paid thee once, in pensive strains, One mighty in the realm of lyric song,â A ceaseless wanderer through the wide domains Of thought which to the studious soul belong;â One far withdrawn from this world's busy throng, And seeking still, in academic bowers, A safe retreat from tumult, strife, and wrong; Where, solacing with verse his lonely hours, He wove ambrosial wreaths of amaranthine flowers. To him, from boyhood to life's latest hour, The passion, kindled first beside the shore Of thine own Thames, retained its early power; 'Twas his with restless footsteps to explore All depths of ancient and of modern lore; With unabated love to feed the eye Of silent thought on the exhaustless store Of beauty, which the gifted may descry In all the teeming land of fruitful phantasy. To him the Grecian muse, devoutly woo'd, Unveil'd her beauty, and entranced his ear, In many a rapt, imaginative mood, With harmony which only Poets hear Even in that old, enchanted atmosphere: To him the painter's and the sculptor's art Disclosed those hidden glories, which appear To the clear vision of the initiate heart In contemplation calm, from worldly care apart. Nor lack'd he the profounder, purer sense Of beauty, in the face of Nature seen; But loved the mountain's rude magnificence, The valley's glittering brooks and pastures green, Moonlight, and morn, and sunset's golden sheen, The stillness and the storm of lake and sea, The hedgerow elms, with grass-grown lanes between, The winding footpath, the broad, bowery tree, The deep, clear river's course, majestically free. Such were his haunts in recreative hours,â To such he fondly turn'd, from time to time, From Granta's cloister'd courts, and gloomy towers, And stagnant Camus' circumambient slime; Well pleas'd o'er Cambria's mountain-peaks to climb, Or, with a larger, more adventurous range, Plant his bold steps on Alpine heights sublime, And gaze on Nature's wonders vast and strange; Then roam through the rich South with swift and ceaseless change. Yet with his settled and habitual mood Accorded better the green English vale, The pastoral mead, the cool, sequestered wood, The spacious park fenced in with rustic pale, The pleasant interchange of hill and dale, The churchyard darken'd by the yew-tree's shade, And rich with many a rudely-sculptured tale Of those beneath its turf sepulchral laid, Of human tears that flow, of earthly hopes that fade. Such were the daily scenes with which he fed The pensive spirit first awoke by Thee; And blest and blameless was the life he led, Sooth'd by the gentle spells of poesy. Nor yet averse to stricter thought was he, Nor uninstructed in abstruser lore; But now with draughts of pure philosophy Quench'd his soul's thirst,ânow ventured to explore The fields by science own'd, and taste the fruits they bore. With many a graceful fold of learned thought He wrapp'd himself around, well pleased to shroud His spirit, in the web itself had wrought, From the rude pressure of the boisterous crowd; Nor loftier purpose cherish'd or avow'd, Nor claim'd the prophet's or the teacher's praise; Content in studious ease to be allow'd With nice, artistic craft to weave his lays, And lose himself at will in song's melodious maze. Slow to create, fastidious to refine, He wrought and wrought with labour long and sore, Adjusting word by word, and line by line, Each thought, each phrase remoulding o'er and o'er, Till art could polish and adorn no more, And stifled fancy sank beneath the load Of gorgeous words and decorative lore In rich profusion on each verse bestow'd, To grace the shrine wherein the poet's soul abode. And was his mission thus fulfill'd on earth? For no sublimer use the powers design'd Which liberal Nature gave him at his birth, And life-long culture ripen'd and refined? Owed he no more to Heaven or to mankind Than these few notes of desultory song?â Nay, slight we not Heaven's boon, nor strive to find Occasion to impeach the bard of wrong, Whose strains, a deathless gift, to us and ours belong! If rather for himself, a pilgrim lone Through this cold world, he sang to cheer his way And soothe his soul with music all its own, Than in didactic numbers to convey Wisdom and truth to minds from both astray,â If little reck'd he of his task divine, Man's subject spirit to instruct and sway,â 'Twas, that as yet from Poesy's bright shrine The light which warms our day had scarce begun to shine. Thought hath its changeful periods, like the deep, Of calm and tempest, tumult and repose; And 'twas on times of intellectual sleep That the faint day-spring of his genius rose: Man's mind lay sunk awhile in slumb'rous doze, Its surface yet unruffled by the breeze Which should ere long its hidden depths disclose, And wake to feverish life of fell disease New swarms of embryo creeds and crude philosophies. Years came and went;âbeside the Poet's tomb The flowers of many a spring had bloom'd and died, When times of fierce convulsion, rage, and gloom Arose, and shook the nations far and wide. O then, my Mother, by the verdant side Of thy bright river, lost in dreamy mood, Was seen a stripling, pale and lustrous-eyed, Who far apart his lonely path pursued, And seem'd in sullen guise o'er troublous thoughts to brood. Small sympathy he own'd or felt, I ween, With sports and pastimes of his young compeers, Nor mingling in their studies oft was seen, Nor shared their joys or sorrows, hopes or fears: Pensive he was, and grave beyond his years, And happiest seem'd when in some shady nook (His wild, sad eyes suffused with silent tears) O'er some mysterious and forbidden book He pored, until his frame with strong emotion shook. Strange were his studies, and his sports no less; Full oft, beneath the blazing summer noon, The sun's convergent rays, with dire address, He turned on some old tree, and burnt it soon To ashes; oft at eve the fire-balloon, Inflated by his skill, would mount on high; And when tempestuous clouds had veil'd the moon, And lightning rent, and thunder shook the sky, He left his bed, to gaze on Nature's revelry. A great, a gifted, but a turbid soul Struggled and chafed within that stripling's breast,â Passion which none might conquer or controul, And feeling too intense to be repress'd: His spirit was on fire, and could not rest Through that fierce thirst for perfect truth and love By which, as by a spell, it seem'd possess'd; And long, and oft, and vainly still he strove To realize on earth what only dwells above. To him ideal beauty had unveil'd In blissful vision her immortal face: Alas! what marvel if on earth he fail'd The footsteps of that glorious form to trace? What marvel that to him all things seem'd base, Disorder'd, and corrupt? and when he sought Hope for himself, and healing for his race, Even in the creeds by Christian doctors taught, How cold to him appear'd the comfort which they brought! The thing which is, and that which ought to be!â The Gospel and the Church !âthe precept given, And act performed !âalas ! he seem'd to see Things unlike each to each, as earth to Heaven! And thus from depth to depth of error driven, Through truth blasphemed, a devious course he ran, His brain o'erwrought, his proud heart rent and riven By bootless strife,âa rash, misguided man, Farther from peace at last, than when his quest began. Yet in a world of beauty dwelt he still, Entranced in visions wonderful and bright, Which by strong magic he evoked at will From his soul's teeming depths;âno mortal wight E'er ruled with such supreme, resistless might The wizard realm of fancy; mortal words Did ne'er such music with such thought unite As flow'd beneath his touch from mystic chords, Whose harmony none wake but song's most gifted lords. Thus with a prophet's heart, a prophet's tone, Uttering his fitful oracles he stood 'Midst scorn and hatred, dauntless, though alone; A marvel to the wicked,âby the good Pitied and shunn'd,âand where least understood Most strongly censured.âPeace be with his dust! Nor be his faults relentlessly pursued By reprobation of the wise and just, Who feel themselves but men, and their own hearts distrust. But thou, O nurse and guide of youthful thought, Wast thou all guiltless of thy son's decline From wisdom's ways?âwas no dark mischief wrought In that wild heart through any fault of thine? Didst thou so well perform thy task divine To him and his compeers,âso well instil By precept upon precept, line on line, Eternal truth, that Nature's inborn ill Might not uncheck'd, unchanged, its wayward course fulfil? Nay, mother, veil thy face, and meekly own Thy much unfaithfulness in years gone by;â Thy altar coldâHeaven's light but faintly shownâ Truth, in thy charge, itself becomes a lie, Which, ev'n to boyhood's unsuspicious eye, At once lay bare and flagrant.âWell indeed Might faith and hope beneath thy nurture die, So rudely oft it crush'd the expanding seed, And quench'd the smoking flax, and broke the bruised reed. Those days, we trust, are ended; and do thou Take heed lest they return, and thy last state Be worse than was thy first.âWith reverence bow Before God's throne, and on His bidding wait: So be thy sons for ever good and great, The glory and the strength of this our isle; And thou still fresh at Time's remotest date, While Thames shall flow and thy green meadows smile, And youthful sports, as now, the youthful heart beguile. A HERTFORDSHIRE LEGEND. There is a quiet churchyard, green and lone, Within the bounds of Hertford's pleasant shire, Bedeck'd with many a quaintly sculptured stone, Marking the grave of yeoman, lord or squire; But more than all one tomb arrests the eye,â A mouldering tomb, engraved on which you trace The name of one whose rank on earth was high,â A dame of noble race. And yet the tomb shews scanty marks of care To guard it from the grasp of swift decay, Not such as tombs of nobles mostly bear, Preserved while generations pass away. The crumbling stone has never been repair'd, The worn inscription ne'er rechisell'd o'er; It seems a place accurst, which none have dared To reverence or restore. But what doth most amaze the passer-by Is that from out the space which doth imprison The mortal dust,âtheir branches broad and high Each mixt with each,âten leafy trees have risen; Seven ash-stems their projecting arms shoot forth Across the southern wall of that strange tomb, Three broad-leaf'd planes, umbrageous, o'er the north Diffuse funereal gloom. In these embosom'd and by these embraced The tomb almost is from the soil upborne, While the stout branches, stoutly interlaced, Between and through the stones their path have torn, Disjointing part from part;âwhere once hath stood, To guard the spot, an iron palisade, Rent bars, imbedded in the tough ash wood, Attest the havock made. You might suppose that Nature, for some sin Wrought in the flesh by her now buried there, Refused her that last resting-place, within Her mother-bosom, which the meanest share; Whence from the soil, at one prolific birth, Those trees, joint offspring of her womb's unrest, Emerged, to thrust and jostle out of earth That loath'd, intrusive guest. The story runs (a story which hath found Belief through nigh two centuries of time,) That she whose bones now moulder in that ground Was one whose soul was all infect with crime; The godless daughter of her house, she held Through life a wilful and rebellious way, By no coercion to be tamed or quell'd, Of laws which men obey. A bold, bad woman,âone who scorn'd to shroud Her wickedness, beneath a thin disguise Of outward seemings, from the observant crowd, Or cheat with specious shows the good and wise. No creed her lips profess'd; she never knelt Before the altar of the Christian's God, Nor feign'd a fear her soul had never felt Of His rebuke or rod. But unbelieving, scoff'd at things unseen, Content all bliss hereafter to forego, So she might rule and revel like a Queen In the brief fulness of this world below; To all her passions gave full range and scope, Oppress'd and plunder'd, unrestrain'd in lust, Swoln with ambition, reckless of all hope When dust should turn to dust. So pass'd her threescore years of life away, And now the end of all was plainly near; Stretch'd on her dying bed at last she lay, Contemptuous still of hope, devoid of fear; Relations, friends, the pastor of the fold Vainly of all persuasion tried the force, To wake, within that nature fierce and bold, One pang of true remorse. âNay,â she made answer, âI have lived my life Like one above all bonds which bind the weak; With priestcraft's vile impostures still at strife, Nor will I now a late acceptance seek From powers (if such there be) so long defied; Let those who will, a final judgment dread,â Be it mine to sleep for ever side by side With the unreturning dead. âTo me, be death an everlasting sleep; Of soul and sense annihilation blank; Whate'er I am let earth for ever keep, O'ergrown by weeds and mosses green and rank. Or if (which I believe not) there should be A resurrection, let my grave a sign Bring forthâa cluster'd growth of tree with tree, Around my tomb to twine.â She died,âthey bore her body to the grave, And o'er it raised the tomb which still is there; But lo! the sign! green leaves above it wave, And whisper sadly to the summer air; (For heaven and earth her wild defiance heard)â Ten twisted stems, forth darting from the soil, Embrace the tomb wherein she lies interr'd, As with a serpent's coil. 'Twere no irreverent fancy to suppose (What fond poetic fables feign'd of yore) That those strong trunks and clustering boughs enclose The spirit housed in fleshly frame no more; That in those sighs, which seem to load the gale, When through the leaves the midnight winds complain, Is heard the bitter and despairing wail Of that lost soul in pain. Meanwhile the rustics hold the place accurst, Still o'er all hearts it breathes a spectral gloom, Scarce soften'd by the buds which o'er it burst,â Bright types of life emerging from the tomb; Not reverence claim'd for old patrician race, Not all the tenderness to woman due Can bless the grave of one to Heaven's high grace And nature's voice untrue. Alas! but what, if God-dethroning thought (That charter'd troubler of this latter day) From court to cot should silently have wrought, By slow approaches, its insidious way? What, if the hope, religiously enshrined As yet within the soul of almost all, Like some strong fortress sapp'd and undermined, Should topple o'er and fall? What if the creed, bequeath'd to son from sire, Like some unholy thing, aside be thrown? What if yon church, from chancel floor to spire, Be shatter'd and disjointed, stone from stone? And men no more before Christ's altar pray, But seek that tomb, which now in fear they shun, Their godless homage of applause to pay To that audacious one? âShe was, in sooth, a herald of the light Which now enlightens every soul of man; She fought and conquer'd, in her single might, Time-rooted error, ere our strife began. Blest be the boughs which cluster o'er her grave, Fresh emblems of the vigorous faith which lay Deep in that heart so noble, free and brave,ââ Thus haply men may say. But then o'er England, in its breadth and length, The plague of social sickness will have spread; The Queen of nations will be shorn of strength, The life of life in her great heart be dead; And through the trembling cities of the land Her guardian angel's voice, in loud lament, Proclaim that now from her sin-palsied hand The sceptre shall be rent. Must this be soâor may the plague be stay'd? O ye who guard the sacred shrines of truth; O ye who train, in academic shade, The mind and spirit of our English youth; And ye who, bound by ministerial vows, Dispense, in plenteous streams, the living word,â Arrestâavertâwhile yet the time allowsâ The curse which brings the sword! THE KNELL OF THE NAMELESS. There is a voice which never sleeps,â From day to day, from year to year, Monotonous accord it keeps With hearts which throb its tones to hear; No moment passes, but on earth It tells of sadden'd home and hearth, Of widow'd spouse, of childless sire, Of orphans in their misery left, Of brothers, sisters, friends, bereft Of all their heart's desire. Strange fancies doth its solemn sound To meditative ear suggest, Of joy and grief alike profound, Of earthly tears, of heavenly rest, Of living hearts with anguish riven, Of souls which part redeem'd, forgiven; Of others whom surviving love Pursues with mingled doubt and fear, Uncertain if disseverance here Will terminate above. To-day I heard that solemn sound; Expected on my ear it broke, To tell me that repose was found By one of whose release it spoke From long, long years of mortal pain,â Of loving hearts which still remainâ Their anxious watchings done and past,â The wakeful night, the weary day With her who in her anguish lay, Exchanged for rest at last;â The room of sickness throng'd no more,â The breathless hush, the silent tread Of sister footsteps on the floor Around the dying sister's bed;â At the domestic meal to-day One seat is voidâone face away,â The rest assembled mutely feel That now no task of patient love Demands that one remain above To help, where none can heal. At night strange footsteps over-head Give note of preparation drear, To bear the unresisting dead Away from all she loved so dear. To-morrow, when they seek the room Where still she lies, a deeper gloom Its solemn stillness will o'er-cloud;â The ghastly trappings of the grave On her restored to Him who gave;â The coffin and the shroud. Another mornâand through the door That lifeless form, beloved so long, Shall vanish to return no more, Borne by a sad funereal throng Of mourners, headed by their chief, And robed in sable garb of grief;â Anon, within the churchyard walls, The vault re-open'd for the dead,â The mould upon the coffin spread, Which rattles as it falls. Dread symbols, which oppress the heart With mortal sadness all their own, And speak but of our baser partâ This mouldering mass of flesh and bone: A darker grief, a deeper gloom Should herald sinners to their doom, Whom unrepented sin drags down; While marriage peals and bridal white Should celebrate the sunward flight Of saints who claim their crown. That crown the enfranchised sufferer wears, (Doubt not, ye mourners, nor distrust,) Of whom to-day, with parting prayers, We render back the dust to dust. Through tribulation long and sore, Which she with faith and patience bore, Her spirit cleans'dâher sin forgivenâ Victorious over mortal pain, She broke the last strong links which chain Earth's holiest back from Heaven. No common mind was hers, I wot, Albeit on earth ordain'd to share A common, undistinguish'd lot, A meek and modest part to bear: Calm, cheerful, self-possess'd, sedate, She kept her life-long celibate, Attendant still on duty's call; Consoled the grief, enjoy'd the mirth Of those who shared her home and hearth, Beloved, revered by all. To her, by no unkind decree, One door was shut of outward sense, And thus her soul preserved more free From taint of moral pestilence: Through entrance of the fleshly ear No sound, which she disdain'd to hear, Could her unwilling sense enthral; She shunn'd the false, received the true, The good without the evil knew, Like Eve before her fall. And more than all she might have gain'd Of knowledge through that sense denied, With stedfast purpose she obtain'd, And patient, self-improving pride; Self-disciplin'd, almost self-taught, And strengthen'd by habitual thought And study both of books and men, Well stored with wisdom's wealth she grew, Could teach, direct, advise, as few Can do with tongue or pen. An earnest, energetic soul Was hers, on active labours bent,â Fit to command and to controul, And still on generous aims intent: But when with Christian zeal her breast, As life wore on, was now possest, And she to work her Master's will Her whole concentred being gave, A spirit more resolved and brave Did ne'er such task fulfil. On peaceful days her lot was cast, And though a peaceful life she led, A spirit as of times long past Was in her heart and in her head. The name was hers, in days of yore Which that Bethulian Matron bore, Who saved by one undaunted blow Her country and her spotless fame,â And she, I deem, had done the same, If Heav'n had will'd it so. But born in less ungentle days, And nurtur'd in a milder creed, 'Twas her's, to walk in happier ways, A Christian both in word and deed. Her joy with fervent words to win The sinner from his path of sin, To utter, as with tongue of flame, The truth which in her bosom glow'd, And to the straight and narrow road The wandering soul reclaim. And thus abroad, and thus at home, Did she her path of love pursue, Until the wane of life was come, And longer now the shadows grew. Then 'twas,âas though with suffering long To tame that spirit bold and strong, And make it as resign'd to bear, As firm to work, the will of God,â That sickness came with chastening rod To smite, and not to spare. Twelve years with racking pain she strove, Still deepening on from worse to worse, While still, with unabated love, Each sister play'd the patient nurse; And on her face, and in her mien, A premature old age was seen; And in her agony of breath, And in her worn and wasted form Appear'd, how fearful was the storm Which swept her on to death. But then, from out the inner soul, A glory, not discerned before, With most serene effulgence stole, And burn'd and brighten'd more and more; A glory, kindled from above, Of firmest faith and hope and love, Transfiguring the outward man Into its own celestial light,â A raiment so resplendent white No fuller whiten can. The earthly was unearthly made, The mortal had immortal grown, All things which fail, all things which fade, Assumed a nature not their own: And still, as droop'd the outward flesh, The soul within grew strong and fresh, And while the frame was rent and riven With deadliest pain, all eyes might see That with internal rapture she Already tasted heaven. But though, as you might well infer, Partaker of a heavenly birth, Her bliss abated nought in her Of her old sympathies of earth. She loved, as in her youthful prime, The household jest, the poet's rhyme; Still than of old enjoy'd no less The company of friends who came To cheer her with a friendly game (The tea removed) at chess. But most of all she loved the sport Of children and their artless ways, And made her chamber the resort Of gamesome elves and sprightly fays, While strength for that sufficed her yet; My own, I ween, will ne'er forget Those liberal gifts, that sumptuous fare, And how her pain she would beguile By watching, with a silent smile, Their gambols from her chair. Why dwell on nature's dread decay,â The agony of mortal strife,â The soul that longed to flee away And be at rest in death from life? Such struggles all must share and see, Or e'er the spirit can be free From mortal sickness, grief, and pain; But ill doth such stern anguish suit The tinkling of the minstrel's lute, The bard's fantastic strain. She died:âwhat marvel?âall must die, The strong, the weak, the young, the old: 'Tis time that we our tears should dry For one whose funeral knell hath toll'd. Our race, like hers, will soon be run, Our crown for ever lost or won: On! Christians! where, with beckoning hand, The loved, the lost, the pure, the brave, Their cross-emblazon'd banner wave Above the promised land. THE POET'S DAUGHTER. A vision crossed my path in youth,â A brighter none have seen; I deem'd not upon earth in sooth That aught so fair had been. Whate'er this world had shown to me, Or Fancy dream'd, as what might be, Was spiritless and mean, Contrasted with the rich excess Of that transcendent loveliness; And yet full well I knew the form Which then before me stood, With human life and love was warm,â A thing of flesh and blood; The sister of my bosom friend She came, awhile the charm to blend Of loveliest maidenhood, Beneath her mother's sheltering care, With college walls so grim and bare. My poet-pencil may not trace, With touches weak and faint, The glory of that angel face Too fair for words to paint: An emanation she might seem Of some intense, seraphic dream By bard or prophet saint Conceived: and such an one I ween The author of her birth had been. And fresh from mountain-rock and rill, Broad lake and heathery glen, And free discourse with thoughts that fill The master minds of men, Among our cloister'd courts she came,â In mind, in person and in name, A light to cheer the den Of murky, scientific thought, With rays from God and Nature caught. Through many a verdant garden walk And pillar'd, dim arcade, I led, in free, permitted talk, That glorious mountain maid; And, looking back, it seems to me, That, had I then been fancy-free, I scarce had been afraid To cast before her feet my whole Of mind and heart, of sense and soul. But now, when thirty years are o'er, With full assent I see That Heaven had better things in store Alike for her and me. Apart our several journeys lay, And when five years had passed away The thing which was to be Had been;âwe met within that span,â The bride betrothed, the married man. The full effulgence of her bloom Was then indeed gone by, And days of anxious care and gloom Had dimm'd her cheek and eye; Yet still my reverent gaze could trace The perfect outline of her face, The feeling deep and high, The beaming thought, the brow's expanse, The pure angelic countenance. They met, conversed (my wife and she) With frank and cordial speech, And I, methought, began to see That each grew dear to each: But brief the intercourse allowed, And soon alas! life's crush and crowd Had borne, beyond our reach, Her who perchance had, nothing loth, Been else the cherish'd friend of both. Nine years roll'd by,âwe met again, Almost at noon of life; Well wore she then her wedlock's chain, A mother and a wife: Her husband, one, for many a year, My school and college friend sincere, In keen forensic strife By this engaged,âyet leaning more To letter'd than to legal lore. She had not changed her maiden name By sharing his;âbeneath Their friendly roof I went and came, On Hampstead's breezy heath. With them the aunt and mother dwelt, Between their knees two children knelt, And twice from out its sheath The sword of Death, in fell despite, Had leapt, their outward bliss to smite. Years swiftly came,âas swiftly fled,â Beneath the churchyard stone The husband slumber'd with the dead, The wife lived on alone: A patient servant of the cross She meekly bore and felt her loss, Till grief had older grown; And then to studious toil resign'd Her energies of heart and mind. No mine of new or ancient thought From her withheld its ore; By Grecian wisdom she was taught, And skill'd in German lore. Of every clime, of every age, Of theologian, saint and sage All depths did she explore; While o'er all other minds was thrown The native lustre of her own. Almost with every various power Her genius seem'd endued; On fancy's wing from flower to flower Now flutter'd, light of mood,â Now, to sublime exertion wrought, In agony of wrestling thought Its painful way pursued Through metaphysic mazes dim,â Now track'd the flight of seraphim. But most to one absorbing aim She bent her steadfast will,â To vindicate her Father's name Through good report and ill; From stigma cast by slanderous foe, From open or insidious blow, Renew'd, repeated still, To place his mighty memory clear Was what on earth she held most dear. Thus pass'd her period of decline In pious toil away, While still her beauty more divine Appear'd in its decay; Though cheek and eye less lust'rous grew, And those rich locks of loveliest hue Were slightly tinged with grey, In eyes that on her aspect gazed Like mine, celestial glory blazed. Such looks seraphic as the art Of Guido loved to trace,â Such as his pencil could impart To Cenci's angel face,â Seem'd to proclaim to heart and eye That her transition now was nigh To that congenial place, To which, as to their proper home, Earth's purest make such haste to come. Yet not without some natural pain Can souls of heavenly birth Break the last link of that strong chain Which binds them down to earth: And we, of less ethereal mould, Feel not the fibres manifold Which knit, in grief or mirth, The mind of more exalted powers To this entangling world of ours. The flush of philosophic thoughtâ The joy of knowledge wonâ The freights by wandering fancy brought From worlds beyond the sunâ The inward eye no longer blindâ The converse high of mind with mindâ The race so bravely run By kindred soul with kindred soulâ Yet unattain'd the glorious goal;â A startling and a fearful change,â Ere life hath reach'd its eve, For worlds unknown, obscure and strange, Such living work to leave. Repose mysterious, dark and dread, To sleep among the unconscious dead:â And well may we believe That ghastly must have seem'd to her The darkness of the sepulchre. Yet, gazing on that prospect drear, No jot did she abate Of labour which she held so dear, But early still and late Her task of filial love pursued, And oft cast down, but ne'er subdued, Did patiently await The summons, which she knew must come Full soon, to her eternal home. And when at last her parting hour She surely felt was nigh, Alone she met the grisly power, And veil'd her face to die. No sympathizing voice or look Of friends or kindred would she brook, But hid from human eye The agony of that last strife Through which she wrestled into life. No vestige, when the breath had fled, Of all that beauty rare, They say remain'd upon the dead Once more than earthly fair. The traits, so potent to express The spirit's inward loveliness, Of that despoil'd and bare, Were left in deepen'd lines at length, Stern types of intellectual strength. So best decreed;âhad all been spared Of feature and of form, It seems as if we scarce had dared To give it to the worm. But now her soul's deserted shell Served by its utter wreck to tell How fierce had been the storm Of pain and grief, through which she pass'd Victorious into life at last. Of her, now sleeping in the grave, The gifted and the graced,â Some relics stillâthe books she gaveâ The words her fingers tracedâ Her letters, long preserved with careâ A ringlet of her youthful hairâ And, ne'er to be effaced,â Her image in my memory's shrineâ Must still, while life remains, be mine. Her resting-place is green and fair On Highgate's gentle steep; Her father, mother, husband there In peace beside her sleep: In Grasmere is her brother's grave, Where o'er the chords of wood and wave The mountain breezes sweep; Fit requiem for the poets twain There, side by side, at rest from pain. High privilege, to one like me, Such mortals to have known; 'Tis easier, when their graves I see, To think upon my own. O! when beyond life's middle stage Extends our earthly pilgrimage,â Like grass untimely mown, The great, the good, who made it sweet, Lie stretch'd in heaps beneath our feet. One yet remainsâa brother mind In genius as in birth, By those beloved ones left behind, To mourn their loss on earth:â Yet scarce to mourn:âwhy squander tears On those, to whom a few short years, Soon spent, and little worth, Shall bring us, like themselves set free From all that dimm'd humanity? AN EMIGRANT'S DIRGE. Sleep, though the broad Atlantic water Divides thee with its billowy foamâ Thee, Britain's own true-hearted daughter,â From this thy first, thy native home. Sleep, where our Shakespere's tongue resoundeth,â Where hearts are by his magic moved; Sleep, where a nation's young heart boundeth To watchwords which our Milton loved. Sleep, where in long unrest, forsaking The haunts and homes of English life, A lonely Mourner's heart is aching For theeâthe matron, friend, and wife. Sleep, where a sister's voice of wailingâ A still small voice, o'er ocean sent,â Above all alien sounds prevailing, Shall lull thee with its low lament. Sleep, from the wizard banks of Avon A nameless poet bids thee sleep, Where thy toss'd bark hath found a haven From life's still vext, tempestuous deep. Sleep, till the trump of doom awake thee, A Christian's crown, we trust, to win, When pure the atoning blood shall make thee From earth's last lingering taint of sin. EASTER DIRGE FOR THE DYING. Wasting, waning, on the bed Of thy patient anguish dying, Christian sister, thou wast lying, While the church, o'er him who bled For the living and the dead, In funereal anthems sighing Bow'd her reverential head. 'Midst that plaintive threnody For the Death of Expiation, Mixt with prayer and supplication, Came the frequent thought of thee, Christian sister, unto me;â Might thy pangs but find cessation With the pangs of Calvary! But the day of dread and doom Pass'd, and stars of orient splendour Shot their light serene and tender Through the circumambient gloom Of that awful garden-tomb, Where ambrosial balm engender Flowers of amaranthine bloom. Fainting, fading, in the thrall Of thine unabated anguish, Christian sister, thou didst languish, Longing, listening for the call Of the Lord and Life of all, Preaching to the souls in prison, Till two other morns have risen, Till one other night shall fall. Waned the light of Easter-eve;â Still thy warfare was unfinish'd, Still thy patience undiminish'd; Not a thought of thine shall grieve Him in whom thou dost believe: When he quits the grave tomorrow, Will he in these bonds of sorrow Still thy chasten'd spirit leave? So I ask'd,âand hope aroseâ Trembling hope,âthat Christ would banish Pain with life, and cause to vanish All thy weakness, all thy woes, In the deepest, last repose, On that day of joy immortal When the grave's reluctant portal Did for him its jaws unclose. But it dawn'd,âand its decline Soon was come;âbeside thee kneeling, Spake I words of peace and healing To that suffering soul of thine; While the mystic bread and wine On the little bed-side table Stood, and thou once more wast able Still to taste that food divine. And the solemn time was o'er, And the sacrifice was ended;â Christ had to the grave descended, Died, and risen to die no more: Still thy bark was toward the shore Through tempestuous waves proceeding, Still for thee our hearts were bleeding, Christian sister, sad and sore. Yet 'twas well thou should'st endure Through that high, mysterious season, To thy faith and to thy reason Bringing confirmation sure: With a spirit true and pure Thou hast borne the tribulation, Thou hast shared the expiation; Rise with Christ!âof full salvation Through His blessed cross secure. Meekly yet thy burden bear, Christian sister, while he willeth; While for thee his spirit stilleth Pangs himself hath deign'd to share: Let him smite, or let him spare, While these mortal hours yet linger;â Thou therein discern'st the finger Of his guidance and his care. Thou art near thy trouble's end;â Ours 'twill be, impatient-hearted, Soon to mourn for thee departed,â Thee, the Mother, Wife, and Friend; O! that thou might'st then descend From the mansions of thy glory, To disclose the wondrous story, How thy grief, so transitory, Doth Eternal Love commend! SONNET. [Dost thou still live, or is thy trial o'er] Dost thou still live, or is thy trial o'er, Thou saintly sufferer, whom, at duty's call, Reluctantly I left in mortal thrall, At strife with death in conflict dread and sore?â Hath pain dominion over thee no more, From earthly bonds deliver'd once for all? Dost thou, secure within Christ's presence-hall, Him whom thou lovedst face to face adore? In Paradiseâon earthâwhere'er thou art, Still in the flesh imprison'd, or set free,â O may'st thou yet retain thy human heart, And still sometimes, beloved, think of me, And of the grace vouchsafed me to impart Celestial comfort to thine agony. SONNET. [I would not think that I have look'd my last] I would not think that I have look'd my last On that seraphic face, those heavenly eyes; Nor that, when thou shalt from the grave arise, Thy mortal beauty will be gone and past; Fain would I cleave to the fond vision fastâ That in our final home beyond the skies Soul shall meet soul in its corporeal guise, Changed, not destroyed, by that dread trumpet-blast. Such hope doth Scripture warrant; such may we In humble trust hold firmly, though as yet We know not what hereafter we shall be, But in our dim half-knowledge guess and fret, Till nature shall have paid her final debt And death be swallow'd up in victory. SONNET. [Mysterious, sure, as mighty, is the spell] Mysterious, sure, as mighty, is the spell In which doth Beauty man's proud spirit bind, Disguising the false heart, the abject mind, The soul which doth against all good rebel, Like some foul grub encased in gorgeous shell; Such contrast in conjunction still we find Between the souls and bodies of our kind, Since Adam from his primal glory fell: But when the saintly soul, enshrined within, Doth the fair body grace and glorify, And that most complex fascination win At once the outward and the inward eye,â We feel that Beauty, here usurp'd by sin, Is one with Good by final destiny. SONNET. [O come not back, O come not back, dear Saint] O come not back, O come not back, dear Saint, Even from the threshold of the court of Heaven,â Thy race so nearly run, thy sin forgiven, Thy spirit cleansed from all polluting taint; O come not back, to feel the dread constraint Of those sharp bonds which Death almost had riven, And to and fro 'twixt him and life be driven, Till even thy patience scarce forbears complaint. Far rather be our loss thine endless gain, Our tears attest the fulness of thy bliss, Than that thou still should'st drag life's galling chain And still thy well-won crown of glory miss; Ripe for the next world, yet fast bound to this In fiery fetters of tormenting pain. SONNET. [The hand of Death lay heavy on her eyes,â] The hand of Death lay heavy on her eyes,â For weeks and weeks her vision had not borne To meet the tenderest light of eve or morn, To see the crescent moonbeam set or rise, Or palest twilight creep across the skies: She lay in darkness, seemingly forlorn, With sharp and ceaseless anguish rack'd and torn, Yet calm with that one peace which never dies. Closed was, for her, the gate of visual sense, This world and all its beauty lost in night; But the pure soul was all ablaze with light, And through that gloom she saw, with gaze intense, Celestial glories, hid from fleshly sight, And heard angelic voices call her hence. SONNET. [They drew the thick green curtain-folds aside] They drew the thick green curtain-folds aside, That so the ritual words mine eye might trace Which give the Christian, even in Death's embrace, His flesh and blood, who once for sinners died; But when once more her features I descried, She saidââI shrank from shewing thee my face, Lest its sad image Time might not erase From thy remembrance, friend beloved and tried.â Ah! fond!âto deem that on my heart and brain That saintly look of patient, meek distress, Which spake of faith triumphant over pain, No holier, dearer image could impress Than even the cherish'd visions which remain Of her once rare and perfect loveliness! THE SHADOW OF DEATH. We had not met, nor each with each Exchanged a word of human speech;â I scarce had heard her name, or known How near her dwelling to my own; When first, in anxious grief and fear, With faltering voice and rising tear, Her husband came to ask my prayer, And some few words of pastoral care, To soothe the soul which seem'd to be Fast hurrying to Eternity. I knelt beside her in the gloom Of the dim, closely curtain'd room: So dark it was, I could not trace The outline of her pillow'd face, Nor guess if she, reclining there, Was old or young, was dark or fair; Feeble and faint her accents came From out that worn and wasted frame; She spake of sin which grieved her still,â Of wayward heart and selfish will,â Of doubts which oft, when near life's goal, Oppress the saintliest Christian soul;â Misgivings, such as still will vex Our mortal frailty, and perplex The heart intent on heavenly things With anxious, deep self-questionings. Few words I utter'd in reply,â Such words as oft to those who die Had, in my past experience, brought The comfort which their weakness sought;â Few words, but utter'd in a tone Which shew'd I made her griefs my own,â Discern'd her burden, and would fain Remove the weight, relieve the pain;â Few words, but when they ceased, I knew That she had felt them sweet and true; Yea that to them had power been given To rend the veil 'twixt her and Heaven; And when together we had pray'd, And each to each farewell had said, Parting I felt I left behind A peace my coming did not find. Againâagainâfrom day to day, I knelt beside her where she lay; Again we held communion high, Again in mutual sympathy, With unrestrain'd and fervent speech, Each spirit was reveal'd to each; And we, who never yet had seen Each other's features, form or mien, Could yet discern, by converse taught, The mysteries of each other's thought. Such light could pierce the spectral gloom Of that dim, closely curtain'd room. At length was past the storm of pain, And partial health returned again: The curtains which shut out the light Were now withdrawn, and on my sight There burstâno language can express What rare and perfect loveliness;â A temple worthy of the mind Saintly and sweet therein enshrined; A beauty, blemishless and bright As the pure soul it veil'd from sight. Thanks! to the providential love Which fix'd my portion from above, Ordaining by benign decree That I of English birth should be; An alien from the rites of Rome, A pastor with a happy home. Thanks! for those dearest boons of life, The love of children and of wife; The heart-repose, the healthful play Of feelings which the spirit sway; To none so precious or so blest As him who seeks a needful rest For weary heart and weary brain From pastoral labour, oft in vain,â From cares which still the spirit vex, From questions which the mind perplex;â His daily lot whose neck must bear The yoke of ministerial care. Thanks! for these boons,âfor what they yield To hearts against all peril steel'd By their strong magic, in the hour When else temptation most had power. Thanks! for a joy too pure to tell, Which they alone make possible For man commission'd to impart Counsel and help to woman's heart, In woman's loveliest charms array'd And in its weakness self-display'd. Thanks! for these boons, which give him power To solace woman's darkest hour,â To share, unscathed in soul or sense, The treasure of her confidence; Which make his spirit clear and free, Through wedlock's lawful liberty,â To teach, direct, support, console A weak and trusting sister's soul. Thanks! for these boons, to Him who gave, To them, the faithful and the brave, Who bled and burn'd to wrest from Rome The freedom of the pastor's home. Thanks! for the stalwart arms which broke The celibate's detested yoke; Thanks! for deliverance from the thrall Of the obscene confessional; Thanks! that the priest no more may pry With busy, keen, intrusive eye, And craft, by vile experience taught, Into those secret cells of thought Which nature teaches to conceal; Which conscience shudders to reveal; Which, once disclosed, the heart no more Can, to itself, itself restore. Thanks! that, instead, 'tis ours to know The free, spontaneous, natural flow Of thought reveal'd from soul to soul, Without constraint, without controul; The counsel freely given as sought,â The teacher learning from the taught, The mutual faith, by each to each Imparted in untrammell'd speech; The healthful play of heart, which springs From free and genial questionings On subjects of allow'd debate Affecting our eternal state. Thanks! for the moral freedom wrought By womanly and manly thought;â Thanks! for the moral health sustain'd By Christian courage unrestrain'd;â Thanks! for the full communion given, Through priestcraft's fall, 'twixt earth and heaven;â Thanks! for the deep and quiet bliss,â The faith, the strength, which flow from this. God grant that it through time may last! God give us grace to hold it fast! In Church and State, in hearth and home, God shield us from the guile of Rome! And help us to stand firm and free In this our Christian liberty! Such thoughts within me would arise, As in the light of those sweet eyes I sat, and saw their soul-lit ray Grow brighter still from day to day. From that fair cheek and marble brow Death's shadow had departed now; And she, though oft with pain at strife, Once more resign'd herself to life; Content deliverance to forego From its dull weight of care and woe; Still of her crown to feel the loss, And bear the burden of the cross, Till she by patience might fulfil Her Father's and her Saviour's will. So weeks and months flew swiftly by, And still, from time to time, did Iâ My daily round of duty o'er,â Return at evening to her door; Too happy if I then might share, Beside her couch or easy chair, Some brief exchange of thought for thought; Where each from each received unsought Some mutual gift, and some bestow'd; Each somewhat to the other owed Of doubt resolved, of knowledge gain'd, Of care beguiled, of faith sustain'd, Of speculation high and keen Set wandering through the world unseen. Nor lack'd we moods of talk more gay, And cheerful intellectual play; In genial flow of temperate mirth, Discoursing oft of things on earth, Till heart to heart itself had shown In weakness, as in strength, made known; Array'd in nature's week-day dress Of plain, unvarnish'd homeliness; And confidence between us grew From all that each both felt and knew. But this was not to last;âagain Burst on her the fierce storm of pain; So fierce, so fell, that to her side All access was perforce denied, And weeks and weeks wore darkly past, And her sweet life was waning fast, Ere I again approach'd the gloom Of that dim, closely-curtain'd room; Then, when the strife seem'd nearly o'er, They came to ask my prayers once more;â Once more beside her couch I knelt, Once more, in high communion, dwelt, With her pure spirit, upon themes Transcending the sublimest dreams Of sage or prophet, but which she With the soul's eye began to see, Touch'd with such hues as angels paint To vision of expiring saint. For she had now approach'd the bar 'Twixt things which seem and things which are; And through the mists of fleshly sense Almost discern'd, with gaze intense, Glories unknown to mortal eye, And heard faint snatches floating by Of music which no fleshly ear Amidst the din of life can hear. O! those brief moments daily given Of peace which seem'd the peace of Heaven! When through the darkness I could trace The outline of that angel face, And with intent, habituate eye Its hidden loveliness descry, Unchanged by all that anguish sore Which still from day to day she bore In faith and patience, while the strife Was raging between death and life. O! those high thoughts between us bred! The rapture of that dying-bed! That intercourse serene and free, Of full, congenial sympathy, Which o'er our spirits breathed the balm Of Paradise, sublimely calm!â An antepast of their high lot Who like the angels marry not. But now arrived a darker hour, When she, beneath the o'erwhelming power Of agony, no more could bear The bedside tread, the whisper'd prayer. So weary weeks again wore by,â She waned and waned, but could not die; For the pure spirit's swift release From fleshly bonds to rest and peace, We pray'd and hopedâto hope and pray Againâagainâfrom day to day. At last the blest deliverance came, And from that worn and wasted frame Reclaim'd, restored, renew'd, forgiven, Her saintly spirit pass'd to Heaven. 'Twas mine, âin sure and certainâ trust To render back her dust to dust; And from the grave, wherein inurn'd The body lay, when I return'd To my known round of duties back, I felt that o'er my daily track A seraph watch'd, thenceforth to be For ever in my company. I felt that to that heavenly cloud Of witnesses, which in the crowd And coil of earth I once have known,â Now compassing the eternal throne,â And chiefly those to whom through me The grace was sent which made them free From fear and doubtâone witness more Was added, whom, when death is o'er, I trust that I again shall meet, Sweet as on earthâand scarce more sweet. And now when I to thought recall My heart's best treasures, one and all, I count, upon that list of love, One less below, one more above; And know that to my charge was sent, With gracious and benign intent, A saintly soul, to whom 'twas given To draw me in her wake toward Heaven. EPITAPH. A saintlier spirit, in a lovelier frame, Ne'er foil'd Death's sharpest sting, than thine in thee; Now sleep secure in Christ's victorious Name, And where thou art may all who love thee be! THE RESTING-PLACES. Nine years have come and gone, the tenth begun, Since here, amidst these haunts of my young lifeâ These well-known hills and valleys,âin the shade Of these rich natural woods,âalong the banks Of yonder stream, my boyhood's Helicon, Wandering in pensive leisure, I awoke My slumbering muse, and sang, as she inspired, My soul's meridian song:ânot then had life Lost its full summer fervour,âno decline Of body or of mind had yet been felt; Each organ of corporeal sense remain'd Uninjured, undecay'd;ânot one grey hair Streak'd the original brown;âon cheek or brow No wrinkle had appear'd;âand if the blood No longer now ran riot in the veins, As in the petulant lustihood of youth, Yet still with unabated force it flow'd,â No more a brawling torrent, but a stream Calm, full, continuous,âfit to bear the frieght Of thought's maturer fruitage:â'twas the noon Of life's advancing day,âa cloudless noon; For sorrow, which had come, seven years before, And cast upon our startled home and hearth The darkness of death's shadow, pass'd away And had not re-appear'd:âlong time unscathed Three generations of our race still lived, And still enjoy'd their life;âthe parent stems Flourish'd in green decline, scarce yet decay; And of their ten primÃ¦val branches, seven Wore their full lustihood of leaf, while three Were rich in bud and blossom:âstill yon house (The general birth-place) trimm'd its Christmas hearth, And spread its Christmas board to mirthful groups Of children and of grandchildren;â'twas sweet To think that each familiar haunt beloved By our own childhood was scarce less beloved By hearts which should inherit when we died, Among their best remembrances, the thought Of those domestic gatherings. Since the last, And haply the most joyous, six swift years Have vanish'd, and again my footsteps treadâ Not now the time-worn floors, the garden walks Of that paternal dwelling,âbut the streetsâ The broad, still, noiseless, melancholy streets Of the old unchanging town;âunchanging?âyes In visible form, but changed and changing fast In all that was to me the life, the soul, The substance of its being:âscarce a face Of all the old familiar onesâthe friends And playmates of my childhoodâmeets me now; Even those which still remain are scarce the same; Where are the well-remembered many?âwhere? The grass grows rankly o'er their mouldering bones, Their names are traced in many an epitaph On churchyard grave-stone, on the chancel floor, On mural tablet, on rich tinted pane Of ornamental window;âor dispersed Through the four quarters of the globe, they toil, Prosper or perish, feed deceitful hope, Or pine despondent on colonial soils, 'Midst savage tribes, in drear, unhealthy climes, Whiten the desert with their bones, or feed The swarming shoals of Ocean:âfor myself Sad is my mission hither:âin our house Another light is quench'd,âanother heart Hath ceased to beat,âanother voice is dumb; The mystic harmony, of late impair'd And waxing feebler in the dwindling choir Of brothers and of sisters, hath been marr'd More than in all the years already gone; For those more early summon'd, since the days Of infancy and childhood, were in age Unequal, or by destiny diverse From us who yet survive;âtheir lives were spent In regions far remote,âamidst the din Of oriental war,âin barbarous strife With Afric's Southern tribes,âor 'midst the roar Of billows in the vast, tempestuous deep. And though we grieved for them, as friends must grieve For friends untimely lost, our household joys,â The family group,âthe fireside circle,âfelt Small diminution;âhome-sweet sympathies,â Fraternal interchange of thought for thought,â The brief, rare visit, sweeter because both,â The keen solicitude of each for each Amidst the daily pressure of the world,â All these were undisturb'd, or scarce disturb'd, By mournful news which told, from time to time, That we had lost a brother:âbut not such The loss we now lament:âa nearer life Hath been struck down;âa widow'd wife bemoans The husband of her youth,âwhile round her knees Her children, all unconscious of their loss (Alas! how great!) observe with wondering eyes The funeral preparations,âmarvel much To find themselves array'd in sable weeds, And probe with questions keen and quaint remarks Their mother's recent wound, who, while she mourns The father, still must think, with anxious heart And doubtful questionings of Providence, Whence bread shall be supplied that these may eat,â Where raiment shall be found which these may wear,â That they with cold and hunger perish not. Peace to my brother's spirit! peace and rest, Such as the troubled and world-weary need! Rest from heart-crushing care and anxious thought,â From those solicitudes of daily life Which torture with such fierce and fiery pangs The man who wrings, by toil of head and heart, From the dry wilderness of English law The daily bread which wife and children eat, Which, if he wring not, wife and children starve. Such rest he needed long,âcondemn'd through life To drag the chain of uncongenial toil, To fret and fritter his reluctant soul (Which craved a nobler destiny) away In the dull, dry, mechanical routine Of vile forensic drudgery,âto grow grey, Immured in murky courts, o'erwhelm'd with piles Of musty parchment,âto repeat the slang And jargon of the special pleader's craft,â To thrid the long and complicated maze Of legal net-work,âlie inwoven with lie,â Trick within trick,âevasion infinite,â Mystification trebly mystified, For darkening counsel and perplexing sore The eye which would distinguish right from wrong. Such occupation,âthrough long years pursued,â Was, to a spirit finely strung as his, Perpetual death in life, compared to which Welcome appear'd the stroke which set him free. For his were apprehensions keen and strong, And most intense susceptibility Of all that to the sense and soul of man Doth from without administer delight; His nature was the nature of one born To high aristocratic destinies,â The duties of the noble and the rich,â And free enjoyment of Ã¦sthetic art, Albeit by fortune's wanton spite deprived Of that which should supply its innate wants And satisfy its instincts;âbut withal His heart awake to loftiest impulses, And full of deep affections,âgenerous, frank, And prompt to sympathize with worth oppress'd, And glow with indignation at the wrongs Dared by the strong oppressor,âsensitive To insult and discourtesy, which oft The noble must encounter from the base,â The gifted from the dunce of large estates,â Could therefore ill constrain itself to brook The meanness it encounter'd in the path Of daily duty:âgrievously the yoke Galls the fleet racer harness'd to a dray; Heavy the fetter on the eagle's foot, Whose nest is on the loftiest mountain-peak, Whose flight above the clouds, a captive now, And tether'd to his perch, to wear out life In the dull court-yard of a Highland inn; But heavier is the chainâmore galling far The yoke which binds the struggling soul of man To tasks which it contemns.âNow all is o'er; The long life-bondage ended:âChristian faith And hope, from no uncertain source derived, Shed parting gleams of comfort on that bed Of mortal sickness:âto the dust his dust Hath been given back;âhis wife and children weep The husband and the father, whom his place On earth shall know no more;ânor they alone,â Brothers and sisters, aged mother, friends By many a close-knit sympathy fast bound To him, the genial-hearted, by his grave Linger lamenting:âother ties more dear, Affections yet more closely intertwined, Even with their heart of hearts than those which bind Brother to brother, and absorb a part Of that especial tenderness, which else Had struck the mourning spirit down to earth With anguish for his loss, disarm in part Grief of its sharpest sting:âin earlier years, Or ever we had known the holier name Of husband, wife, and parent, he had been More bitterly lamented even by us Who yet with sorrow fervent, true, profound, Exclaim above his graveâFarewell! Farewell! Our brother! O! our brother! But while thus His loss is mourn'd on earth,âbeyond the veil Which curtains world from world, methinks arise Fraternal forms to welcome him:âone bears On his projecting forehead the clear stamp Of Nature's true nobility, though dimm'd And tarnish'd by the deep unmaster'd flush Of mortal passions;âseldom hath a soul Braver or nobler to the soldier's trade Brought more of those high qualities which shed A glory o'er the ugliness of war; And had it been but tamed and self-subdued Through firmer disciplineâhad he but learnt To bring into subjection to the rule Of Christian duty that unbridled will,â A nobler human being had not trod The earth which bore him;âbut his nature, rash, Impatient of controul, untaught to yield Submission to a higher purer law Than that of its own promptings, broke all bonds Of social and conventional restraint, And ran mad riot amidst headstrong deeds And too gigantic darings:âEnglish life, With all its dull formalities and rules Of civilized decorum, was to him Intolerable bondage:âhe desired The freedom of the savage, and forsook Home, country, kindredâeven the glowing hopes And high excitements of a soldier's life, To dwell with hunters in the bush,âto war With beasts but little wilder than himself,â To strip the lion of his hide,âto dare The rage of the rhinoceros:âhis life Was one long act of venturous enterprise And rash, Titanic effort, and his deathâ Such as became his life;âthe southern gales Of Afric breathe o'er his untimely grave A fitting requiem;âthere let his dust Repose, while in our hearts remembrance holds His graces still in honour nor retains The blots which dimm'd their brightness. But a voice, Borne on the breezes from the burning East, Murmurs low welcome to the brother soul Rejoining the departed:âlo! a grave, Surmounted by a stone, which bears inscribed A soldier's epitaph beneath the name Of one to whom his comrades raised such pledge Of kindness still surviving in their hearts, And recognition of the worth which dwelt In him who fought beside them, and now sleeps Where no rÃ©veillÃ©e shall awake him more; No night-surprise, no murderous ambuscade Of lurking foemen mingle with the dreams Of that last bivouac;âno worse assault Of passions which invade the peace of man And vex the soul still clothed in flesh and blood, Can shake poor nature's frailty, nor disturb The rest which now enfolds it. From the depths Of Ocean, where it parts West-Indian isles, Rises the pale and spectral form of one Even on the verge of manhood doom'd to sink Into a sailor's grave; who else perchance, Had long ere now fulfill'd, in all its parts, A sailor's gallant destiny;âand he Greets smilingly his brother come to share His long repose. But here, within the walls Enclosing his own grave, is company Such as his soul desiresâone elder-born, And call'd in early boyhood to his rest,â Richest in promise (for the good die first) Of all our bloodâanother, while a babe, Emancipatedâspirits such as claim By right the heavenly kingdom as their own, And now await its coming. Last appears The Father of our house, as of his flock The pastor,âhe who in a ripe old age Ended his five-and-forty years of toil In one rude fold, and went to his reward, A good and faithful servant. Not to us Belongs it to define in outline clear His mental lineaments, or to proclaim His nature's strength or weakness;ânot to us To tell how well he lived, how calmly died, How peacefully now rests with those for whom His spirit toil'd till death,âhow many mourn, How bitterly, his loss;âthat tale was told Even at his funeral, when the silent streets Deserted though at noon-day, and the shops, Their shutters closed, albeit the annual fair Was at its height, proclaimed the pastor dead And gathered to his children:âwe had come The previous evening (for he died far off) A long day's journey, by his sable hearse Preceded, who had left, few days before, His home in health and hope;âthe moonlight shone, How strangely! on the well-remember'd rows Of houses in the broad and echoing street; And when we halted at the door, where he Had welcomed us of old, 'twas sad to think That in a lone and lock'd apartment lay That which was lately he:âkind voices spake, Strangely, as seem'd, to unresponsive hearts, And meals had been prepared, whereat to meet Seem'd now unnatural:âthe morrow dawn'd, And none could say âgood morrow;ââbefore noon The vault which, thirty years before, had closed O'er the last comer, and which still retains One vacant place for her who slept so long, And yet shall sleep once more by him she loved,â Received him in its bosom; and when we Return'd, that ancient house had lost its lord, And we had look'd our last upon the graves Of him and of our brothers. Strange it seems, And not less strange than graciously ordain'd, That while the scatter'd graves of sons and sire Spot the four quarters of the globe,âwhile four Within the precincts of one churchyard lieâ As yet that household hath not yielded up One female life:âmother and sisters still Survive unstricken;âthey to whom pertains The ministry of comfort,âthe blest work Of smoothing the sick pillowâwho best know How to console and cheer the slow decay Of natural strength, and nerve the fainting soul With never-failing tendances of love,â Are leftâperchance till two more graves shall close O'er two more sons and brothers, and their task On earth with these be ended. Peace and rest Dwell in that Churchyard!âin the daily walk Of life, amidst the fever and the fret Of this world's tumult,âit will rise sometimes A soothing vision on our weary souls,â A mute remembrancer of rest to come On earth,âof hope which maketh not ashamed, For those whose conversation is in Heaven! LAST VERSES. TO A LADY. Thy Birthday! yes! the flight of time Once more hath brought it round, And something in the shape of rhyme To greet it must be foundâ Meagre that something needs must be, Yet not, I trust, despised by thee. If fancy's stream flowed briskly still As erst in youthful days, And I with ease could roam at will Through all her flowery ways, Small pain 'twould cost a wreath to cull Which thou would'st deem most beautiful. But fancy's prime with me is o'er, My Pegasus grows idle, And needs the spur, who used to soar, Despising bit and bridle: Verse hath indeed become to me Sore toil and grievous drudgery. The Muse's service long hath ceased Its own reward to be, And thou art from the tax released Which seemed so hard to thee, Albeit it had, if freely paid, The surest inspiration made. I blame thee not, nor love thee less,â Nay, more each passing year; And if true love our portion bless, What need of fancy here? Let song, once prized, become at last A faded dream of days long past. Yet take this lay, a gift of love, Nor rate it by its worth, But by the pains with which it strove And struggled to the birth; So thou its poverty shall prize Above youth's richest fantasies. October 19th, 1858. SONNET. [O! not in youthful love-notes light and vain] TO F. H. For February 14th, 1868. O! not in youthful love-notes light and vain, Nor ditty of fantastical desireâ (Weak, worthless spells a greybeard's heart to fire, And thaw to foolish thought his frozen brain): O! not in such but more befitting strain Today, dear maiden, doth my song aspire From thee, whom many love and all admire, A moment's patient audience to obtain. In me the lover's and the husband's heart Are dead and buried: yet past words of thine (Filial tho' few) parental joy impart To this poor widow'd, wither'd age of mine, To which for all that thou hast been and art, Bless thee!âGod bless thee!âgentle Valentine. TO AUGUSTUS M. SWIFT: NEW YORK. Nay,âask not one whose life hath left behind Our mortal age of threescore years and ten, To grasp with tremulous clutch the poet's pen, Taxing his brain reluctant rhyme to find; Better a barrel-organ's mournful grind, Discordant, dismal to the ears of men, Than croak false notes immured in darksome den Of Eld,âto music deaf, to beauty blind. Seek rather in thy fair and fervent West, Where mind and minstrel-art are fresh and young, Such thought as bubbles up through brain and breast, In verse attuned aright to pen and tongue; Leave here the worn-out rhymer to his rest, His hurdy-gurdy cracked, his dirge unsung. July 10th, 1870. SONNET. [Patiently, fond and faithful, many a year] TO S.A. AND D.R. Patiently, fond and faithful, many a year Ye kept your filial watch, O sisters twain, O'er her for whom, we trust, to die was gain; As for yourselves, 'tis Christ to linger here, While she, beyond the reach of grief and fear, Heart-crushing trouble and life-wasting pain, Knows that for her, He hath not died in vain, Nor ye, for her sake, grown to Him less dear. Grieve (for ye must) while Nature's wound is sore, But grieve as those who know they sow in tears To reap in joy.âYour ministries, now o'er, Of holiest duty have heap'd up a store Of strength angelic for celestial spheres, Where both shall watch and work, but weep no more. August 14th, 1872.</field>
