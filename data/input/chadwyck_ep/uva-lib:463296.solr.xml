      <field name="fulltext">Horatius. Aetas parentum peior auis, tulit Nos nequiores, mox daturos Progeniem vitiosiorem. Well get thy goods, and spend them well: well gotten, keepe the same. Beware of hoorde, hoorde hate doth bring, and vile reprochfull name. Non mordet qui monet, Non vulnerat, sed sanat. To the high and Honorable, and his especiall good Lorde, Lorde Robert Dudley, Earle of Leycester, Baron of Denbigh, and Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, high Stewarde of her Maiesties Burrow of new Windsore, Edw. Hake, vndersteward there, wisheth dayly preseruation with increase of honor to Gods glory. Sith grace hath graffed in your Noble brest, Farre grater gifts then tipe of mundane glee: Sith high renowme, your Honour, &amp; the rest, To Vertue yeeld, and counteruayled bee With great effect of Vertues worthy vew: I make it bolde for vertues ayde to sew. And though my gift (as slender to the shoe) Vnworthy seeme to shrowde himselfe as nowe In blessed Bay from force of deadly foe: Yet Vertue may your Lordships pitte bowe To fense the Booke beset with deadly bate, For that the same explanes the present state, And sets to vew the vices of the time In Nouell Verse and Satyrs sharpe effect Still drawne along and pend in playnest rime For sole intent good liuing to erect: And sinne rescinde which rifely raignes abroade In peoples harts full fraught with sinfull loade. Sith so (I say) therefore your Noble hart Let grace so guide and bend to Vertues bayte, That Satirs these (though seeming somwhat tart) May shielded be from such as lie in waite The same to shend and bring to fowle decaye: To deadly shame, and mortall malice aye. So shall your Lordship shewe your selfe to bee Sole vertues stay, and friend vnto the good: So hate to sinne shal men apparaunt see, And loue set forth to saue the sinfull bloud. And so shall I encouragde in my paine, Proceede, and set my Pen to Booke againe. And euer pray the liuing God of might Your Lordship so to guide by gift of grace, That you may stande accepted in his sight VVhilst here you liue, and in the ende a place Receiue with such as vertues path haue traste: And liue with them that vertue haue imbraste. Your Lordships most humbly at commaundment. Edw. Hake. The same to the Citie of London. A great conquest of sinne hath made a Student Edward Hake. O London learne for to beware, from sinne arise and wake. Of wanton Maydes he did also, the slights a late detect: Learne to be wise, and looke to them, the worst alwayes suspect. Hee hath redusde to vulgare tongue the Imitation true And following of our Captaine Christe, good liuing to renue. A Touchestone for the present tyme hee eke set forth of late, Wherein the ruynes of the Churche with zeale he doth debate. A brief memoriall of our Queene and of her blessed raigne He also wrote in dewe discourse first once and then againe. At length these newes are now come forth wherein thy sinnes he showes. Repent (therefore) and call for grace of God eche thing that knowes. FINIS. The Author to the Carping and scornefull Sicophant. As plated Finne of slender slycing Oare Wherwith the Seaman cuts the crooked waue, Is scant of force tattaine the happy shoare When check of tyde back beares the mighty Naue: So I (no lesse) long lodgde on mounting surge, Was kept aloofe by cankerd caytifes gurge. Though true intent did slyce the streame so swift, Sea beaten Barck could scantly yet obtaine The shoare tyll now: by subtile Zoyls drift And Uipers tongue that beat my Boate amaine. What then? perforce, and maugre Momus head, I skyp on Strond, as free from daungers dread. Let Sicophaunts and Minotaurus broode, Let Ciclops Feere, and subtyle Ciren Hagges, With grinning Iawes and gasping gyddy moode Go shake their eares, and shut their shameles bagges. I force them not, nor Neutrall, Papist, nor Uile Ianus Iacks: their league doo I abhor. Thou Papist, thou, false harted to thy Prince, That wouldste bereaue her grace of princely powre, To thee I say that checking, doost conuince (As seemeth thee) my poynaunt poore deuowre: For that thou deemst me dampned by thy doom, Stand back sir Brock, let Bandog take thy room. Shall brockysh Badger beare as now the sway, Or Shepherdes Dog that bringeth in the Sheepe? Shall wooluish mates that woont the same to slay, Rebuke the Whelpe? no, no, take thou no kepe. To my poore powre yle barck thee from the fold, And shepherdes shall rehayte thee to thy holde. Wherefore, withdraw thy raging spoyle by day And see thou lurck (at least) within thy caue Whyle Sunne is vp, for feare of Hunters pray: What tyme thy craft is not of force to saue. And eke at night, beware ift be thy hap, And keepe thy foote from slipping Hunters trap. And now to thee thou double faced drudge, That plyes thy selfe so plyaunt vnto chaunge, And vnder hand dooste beare thy face so Budge: Thou Tyme sclaue thou, y? sayst my pen doth raunge: To thee I say (for that thou moanst my case) Restraine thy tongue, least I descry thy face. Thy hooded head that doth two faces beare, I see how closely vnderhand it nods, And triple tongue that byds me ware this geare, Least cha?ge should come. But twene vs. ij. be ods. And therfore (Ianus) once againe I say, Go charme your tongue, least I take hood away. And last of all, I turne my tale to thee, Thou nunquam sanus vyle reprochfull mate, And carping carelesse cankerd churle, whom hee That writes ech where, reproues with worthy hate. For that thou belkst with belly bursten paunch, Gainst them that haps from ydle shoare to launch. To thee, to thee my flytting Muse auerres, And bound by Oathe of Fayth, I doo auowe That neyther hate nor harbraynd toy inferres This worke of myne which I doo publysh nowe. Nor meede at all, though where it bringeth gaine, It pleaseth some for to requite my paine. For well thou wotste, if thyrsty were my minde To bend the same to wynne by gaynsome trade, Then would I wryte the thing that Authors finde A gaine within: and whereby Sommes be made. I meane vaine iestes to stirre vp filthy game. But I protest my harte doth hate the same And onely seekes how to sequester sinne, And Sathans dryfts that driue men downe to hell: My thoughts be cleere, my conscience cleane within. Thus knoweth God, that eche ones thought can tell. Wherfore, beware and let thy carping lye. Else, sure my pen my gyltlesse hart shall trye. And to conclude, to all that wysh me well, And loue by tongue, do vtter to my face, I make request that rancour they depell And let their verdict to the Trueth geue place. Else, let them cease to beare of friend the name. For I refuse to take them for the same. Once (sure I am) with quipping querks herein, I haue not meant to taunt, or check the good, Nor (rayling bent) I slaunders doo begin: Though trueth I say, to such as wyll be wood. For gyltie man findes eche thing to his shame. Where good men can their owne offences blame. But well, for fine and finall ende I saye To all such Snakes as styng by stealing pace And boughing Curs that barck and winde away, I holde it best that they no more deface An open trueth: For then, as they deserue, Enbarckt I lye to launch when tyme shal serue. FINIS. The Noueltie of this Booke. Such Noueltie as time doth bring, I yeelde in meeter heere: Euen newes that to the Godly hart may noysome newes appeere. But yet what then? such is the state of this our present time, That now no daye doth passe without some new deuised crime. FINIS. The Glory of the Honorable, is the feare of God. The Beare doth beare me now in hand that Noble is thy race. The vertues of thy worthy minde, shevve forth the gifts of grace. The first Satyr. [As late I walked vp and downe] Aucthor. As late I walked vp and downe, in Powles for my repast, And there (as many woont to doo) about the Church had traste Long tyme alone to view the rowse, and great confused noyse, With pleasaunt chat (a world to see) at length I heard a voyce. And casting backe mine eye, I spyde a pretie wymble lad, Who saluing of his mate, dyd aske what newes were to be had. His fellowe (lyke a gentle swaine, and ioly headed chylde) Conioyned handes, and sighing, sayde a slaue hath me beguilde. But scarcely had he spoken this, or eare his faithfull seere Faste claspte his arme, and him besought, to be of better cheere: And let not chaunce (quoth he) afright, nor so molest your minde, As thus to seeme a Wight that hath his woonted ioy resygnde. Bertulph. Tell tell, quoth Bertulph (so he hight) By whome you are beguylde And eke what cause and cruel chaunce your comfort hath exylde. Paule. O friende (sayde Paule) full soone would I expresse to thee my griefe, But so peruersely falles it foorth that I see no reliefe. But yet sith thou so vrgent arte and earnest of the case, I graunt thereto if thou attende and walke about the place. Content is pleasde, quoth Bertulph tho, and then they walckte yfeere, Aucthor. And I perceyuing all their talcke, approched very neere: And ioyning close vnto their side, I walckt with equall pace (Without offence as I suppose their talcke had such a grace.) Paule. Then Paule began with visage pale and handes conioyned fast, To fettle forth him selfe to speake, and thus he spake at last. The highest God that syttes aboue For aye in heauenly Throne, That Prince of might that rules the heauens and Welkin weeldes alone, He knowes if I do falsely speake, or (mooued through affect) If I through hate or fauor, lye in any one respect. But first, before my tale begyn, Ile tell you howe the slaue Hath many one beguyled earst that sought the same to haue. His name also I wyll not sticke to tell you with the rest. And to be short, He Nummus hight (a passing proper guest,) He lodgeth ofte with Marchauntmen and eke with men of Lawe, And lightly where be bosteth, there are people kept in awe. Ile eke declare howe that as he doth often men beguyle, Euen so him selfe is often catcht, with fraude and filthy wyle. And howe ofte tymes by force they wrest and wring him to their handes And howe from fooles he often flyes and breakes his tynsell bandes, Aucthor. Now, whiles y? Paule was speaking thus, his mate gan me espye. He knewe my minde, I gaue a becke, he wynked with his eye And helde his fynger on his mouth, suspecting sore the man: He thought that fancies fed his braine, his visage lookte so wan And wordes so voyde of woonted sence. But yet (for that he hight, And promisde had to heare the ende) his hest he kept aright. Paule. And forth proceeded Paule at large. This Nummus nowe (quoth he) Is straightly watchte, and hardly kept with men of each degree. He wanteth none to wayte for him, although he scapt from mee. The Laytie and the Clergie bothe, if haply him they see: Will talke with Vobis eare he parte, theyle plucke a Crowe with him. Theyle shut him vp, or sende him forth, some greater gaine to wyn. Or else to worke their neighbors woe, by waginge sutes at Lawe, To bring them selues in prease and price, and to be had in awe. Clergie.But as for Clergie, some of them, they knowe his nature well, They knowe his false corrupting force, with him they will not mell, Except it be where neede requires, and for a iust intent. And surely some, though not the swaye, right so to gaine are bent. Although that some againe doo seeke excessiuely the same, And some do hoorde it vp in store, to their rebuke and shame. But (if I should vprightly speake) Their lyuinges are so lopt, That from th'inferiour Clergie men, long since syr Nummus hopt. I meane not pompous Prelates here, nor Chaplens of degree. These flaunting fellowes by your leaue, will haat ift had maye bee I meane, I meane poore Ministers, some plaste and some disperst. Whome powling Patrons and such lyke, haue greeuously amerst. And yet forsoothe our Baldockes bleate, and say they keepe no cheere. They catche syr Nummus from them still, and yet would haue him heere. But well they are no small fooles nowe, that robbe the Clergies meede. Wherfore to sylence were I best, such wordes may rancor breede. And here you must aduert it well, that iustly men maye seeke For Nummus to releeue their neede, if so their fancie leeke. And also how that they right well the same may styll retaine, So that they doo not boord him vp for sole intent to gaine. But such as I shall here recite, cannot without offence The same or seeke, or keepe, or spend what so be their pretence. Bicause their mindes are all peruerse: they spende for spyte or gaine: And through the lust of lawlesse hoords, the same doo they retaine. And what are they that seeke it so? Euen most men now a dayes. In Countrey, Citie and each where they finde sinister wayes T'obtaine the same, and spende it yll, or else to keepe it worse: And euer aye their mindes are bent to fyll their farsed Purse. But nowe, for that the scope is large where we may finde them out, And time but short, I rather meane to leaue the Country rout, And medle with our Townish lade in London sole precinct, Except (as neede) the Suburbs must be with the Citie Linckt. Wheras, when I haue reckned vp of them the most estates, Then tell howe many kindes of folcke ne lyue within the rates And bounds of honest seeking store. of spending well the same, Of closely couching vp their hoord as bedle Bertulph. Why syr (quoth Bertulph) now me thinks you talke not of the man That seru'de you of that sluttish touch of late I wot neare whan. Paule. O Friende (quoth Paule) is this the faith and this thy late behest? I stickt not to begin my tale at thy alone request: And thou therefore didst promise mee thy silent eare to giue. And yet thou interruptst my tale. Howe should I thee beleue? Of friendly faith attende a while, and marke me to the ende: Then shalt thou thinke that I disclose to thee as to a Friende. Finis. The second Satyr. [As promise presse thine to show] Paule. As promise presse thine to show my minde to thee at large: Euen so t'obserue due order is, belonging to my charge. Har[illeg.] therfore (first) how Nummus doth beguile eche kinde of men: Howe it through force and vyle effect doth noysome humor blen: His beautie (first) and pregnant show, and then his mighty force, Enchaunteth so the peoples hartes: that (voyde of all remorse) They fawne &amp; gape, they watch and prie, they leaze and oft forsweare, They worke the thing that wicked is, they cursse, they ban and teare The blessed name of great Iehoue, and all to wyn the ?fame? They put ?in? vre they practise still to get the golden hame. Men of Lawe.And first beholde our men of law: let them haue chiefest place, Sith by the lawes, [illeg.] common weath doth runne his nightfall race. And for that Lawes accoumpted are, eche where the chiefest staye: Let Lawiers then be principall, and first within my playe. Iudges.But as for Iudges now to iudge, my iudgement will not saye: I wote full well, their prayse was spread by me this other daye. And Trueth it is, our Iudgement seates such Uyrent heades possesse, As former dayes for men of choyse, had neuer such I guesse. What then? no sort, no one degree, no place, no function so Uprightly standes, but with the good some wicked weede doth growe. With vertues league, som vice doth lynk and forme of godly vew Oft equall makes with men of troth, some Hypocrites vntrue. I knowe friend Bertulph, fewe there be whose hands regarde no meede, Whose hartes Dye no deceypt at all, from whome no harmes proceede. And sure I am, when cause of troth, before such men is tryde, ?VV?ith simple troth, they Iustice yeelde, and iustly do decyde. But nowe, although with these there syt no one that doth dissent Though all of them in publicque place doo sing Amesine lentent Yet vnderhande perhaps there are that nowe and then deuoure The sugred sappe that Iustice yeeldes: And where they lyst to lowre For spyte or gayne, or priuate wreke, there Iustice course is stayde. And where they lyst to smoother troth, there, right is cleane dismayde. Such such there be (or haue bin some) who when they rule alone, When scope &amp; course hath hoyst them vp and set them chiefe in Throne From Censors sight, and priuate made their swaye and supreme place: Then then they wring &amp; wrong the right, then then they truth deface. Ah Bertulph, be there not thinke you, In place of Iustice sette Some fained sortes of fawning Spreetes that course of Iustice lette? That frame a semblaunce sound and good, that iuste and holy seeme, And yet in harte are fraught with guyle, and ofte vniustly deeme? I feare I feare me falsehod lurkes in lappes of learned syse I feare me Nummus oft peruerts in some that go for wyse: So then, some chiefe and some besides so smally ponder meede, That where they syt in common swaye, there, Iustice doth proceede. But some againe where place hath made their powres distinct, I feare Of popish willes, through gruteh or gaine with much enorme do beare. And hence, from hence I feare me come these cryes of common sort That oft lament and oft affyrme their Iudgement to be fort. One here bewayles his wofull case and wisheth him vnborne, Another cryes with wringing handes, alas, I am forlorne My sute thus long depended hath: The Lawe is on my syde, And yet in harde delayes I lye true Iudgement to abyde. Another thus: be friended is, the Iudge doth loue him well And me (as poore and needie) they doo dayly thus depell Two hundreth myles and more I come: My Wife at home (alas) Lyes with my Children halfe forepynde: (O lamentable case.) My goods are spent, which labor brought, through long and carefull toyle: The Lawe hath lyckt vp all my wealth for which I dyd turmoyle. Oh, I can haue no Law nor right, ne Money haue I nowe: I must go beg, my goodes be gone, to lyue I knowe not howe. These eares of mine abhorred haue, mine eyes haue wet my plants. My hart hath yernd in Iudgement true, to see such wofull wants. Tys harde to saye, Ile holde my peace. But if these playnts be true, Syr Nummus swayeth there with some, (a woorthy cause to rue.) But vnto him that highest syts, and sees eche secrete yll, With prayer I commytte the same, t'amende it at his wyll. Practisers at the Law.And nowe to Lawiers that do parle, and pleade in cause of right, To such as for syr Nummus wyll turne darknesse into lyght, And lyght into obscured sence, and arsiuersie turne eche thing: To such wyll I proceede as now, and to my matter bring. I wyll not speake of fine deuise, nor fowle deceyptfull clause, In Leases, wyls, and other lyke, but wresting of the Lawes And foding of the Clyent forth: for though that fraude abound, And though by falsely framing so, eche where are beggers founde: Yet I as nowe will blason forth, and geue you well to see, Howe these men ioyne in matters false, retayned for a fee. And so for Nummus long delaye a poore and needy soule, To fleese and flea the simple wretche, to pylfer and to powle: To shred him cleane from all his wealth, and then perhaps relent, And ware full colde to ayde his right, when Nummus all is spent. Yea lykewise tys in doubte with some, when Nummus so doth fayle, If they through brybe of ?thother? syde, let not the sute to quayle. A Fee of Forma pauperis? no no it hath no sent. Such formall Fees finde smal reliefe they buy no lande ne rent. My friend (therfore) if you haue nought wherewith to see me styll But formes and showes, Take formes againe for Counsayle if you wyll. But what sayde I? was promise made to paint such practise heere? No no: If so, I must relent: Great matter doth appeare Therein: and therefore will I leaue them to the worldly vewe: I meane the false and subtil ones, I speake not of the true, Nor such as are affected well (as many there are such Although the false in number doo exceede them very much.) But well, go too: this gotten good howe is it spent I praye? Forsooth, no poore man must haue lande: for so wyll they assaye And practise, that in tyme they wyll gette all into their handes. And turne the poore men headlong forth of all both house and landes. A shame it were and great reproche to see a poore man dwell, Or haue a house not farre from theirs: their Noses hate the smell. And long (no doubt) their Noses be, right mischeuous of Sent: For that which once was lande demeasne, is holden nowe for rent. They smell it forth, though farre it be: they haue a vengeaunce hooke: Both Parsnage and ought besides theyle haue by hooke or crooke. Their Princely Places stately be, their houses buylt for aye, Their Turrettes vp aloft are raysde, foundations deepe they laye, So thus (no doubt) and farre more yll, they let syr Nummus wagge, Reseruing still some mightie Masse to rust within the bagge. And here you see what wayte they laye and eke what wayes they vse To get this pelfe: and gotten, see how they the same abuse. Attorneyes and Petypractisers.The next are Petypractisers and Petyfogging mates: Yea, Clarkes, Attorneyes, such of them as lyne of lewde debates, Eache honest calling towardes Lawe, so pressed is from Sise, That hardly can an honest man with honesty aryse. And twise as hardly may he stande, to stoppe eche strayned shyfte. Such force hath falsehood, more th? truth, so deadly can they lyfte. What crewes of greedy griping crowes, what fowle infecting rowte. Good Lord, what store of gleaning Iacks dispersed are through out? Can Lawes reliefe be easily got, or gotten, can't do ease, Where such great troupes of bribing fists must fyrst syr Nummus cease? Of trueth such traines, of truthles mates such heapes of monsters dwell Tweene playnts and fynall Iudgements seate, that greater woes in hell If hell were as the Poets wryte, I thinke coulde not be felt. Eare Soles haue ende, such chardge, such toyle, as make my harte to melt. But whence aryse these rauening rowtes? whence spring they? Sure from guyle And of disdaine to vulgare state, wherein their Parents toyle. Well, these be they, that what for tale and what for falsehod great, Doo taynt the Realme with stryfes, &amp; stop the waye to Iustice seate. That make the iuyce of Iustice sowre, that turne the Lawes to wreake, That make true Iudgem?t taste like gall, that nought but falsehod speake. That liue and lustily lashe out in purchase or in pride More largely then of Countrey States doth any State beside. But here to shew what prowling means, what pranckes this pylfring sort Doo vse to gette syr Nummus with, and so holde vp their porte: This this to doo, were to to harde. Naye, this were such a woorcke As if one only man should prease to fight against the Turcke. But greater, yea farre greater t'were to clense this Chanell cleane. I thinke Augæus Oxestalles were to this a worcke but meane. I knowe good Iudges haue begoonne and waded verie farre I knowe that some, to helpe these hurtes, right godly carefull are. But new found Clerckes and Officers so prease with might and mayne, That (Hydra like) one head cut of, for eary head springs twayne. Good Lord, &amp; shall these wandring Spreets aye walcke abroade at wyll? Shall Numus no where start, but streight these Catchpolles catch him styll? Shall no mannes eye that lyues this day, beholde a better state? Ah, out alas, and shall this rowte feede alwayes of debate? Why then, what man shall lyue in peace? whose porcion shall be fast? Whose land and lyuing shall be free where these men once are plast? And where almost, or in what Soyle do not these Monsters swarme? What coast frend Bertulph can you name where these men do not harme? I knowe in thissame calling are a sort of seemely Wights That lyue in peace, and further peace, that so their Countrey dights With sounde examples of good life, with Iustice and with truth, That scarce from any state of men a better lyfe ensuth. And in this speache of mine, I meane and eke do comprehende Not only Clerckes and Practisers But also do intende That Counsaylers haue equall praise and higher praise in deede By howe much they in higher place and higher thinges proceede. But these, all these are nowe so matcht and ouerswayde with swarmes: That seeld and seldome can they helpe to keepe the good from harmes. I wishe to God some Theseus might giue a choppe or twayne And rather then these heads should stand, to choppe and choppe againe. Nowe, wheras Bertulph here perhaps you looke I should declare How this great Rabble rakes for coyne, and howe they Nummus snare: I tell you as I tolde you earst, this is too much for me: The pennes of twenty skilfull men for this would needefull be. In briefe, yet thus I dare affyrme that these superfluous traynes In Lawyers state, vse fowle deceytes t'inlarge their priuate gaynes. Which gotten once, is lewdly spent in pompe and prowde araye, To whose fowle rapine seely wightes are ofte and ofte a praye. I leaue them as I lefte the rest, I touche and go my wayes. This short discourse shewes well enough howe here syr Nummus swayes. Finis. The thyrde Satyr. [Aduert we nowe who else there be] Paule. Aduert we nowe who else there be that grasping gape for gaine, And let vs place them in the cue amongst this greedy traine. Phisitions.Phisitions take the seconde roome, for worthy so they be: They stately stalcke, and beare a port in London now we see. With reuerence and worship great, with cap and eake with knee, Wee must beseche his Maistership our Patient to see. And what of this? will this suffice? No: Nummus doth the deede. Vnguentum Aureum or such lyke will make him runne with speede. Go Symon go, or Gilbert else, go cast my footecloth on? No neede to byd the Doctor go, he will be gone anon. And when hees there, with solempne face and graue deuised porte He frames his talke for to perswade or else for to dehorte As lykes him best: he both can doo, and both so finely frame, That Nummus shall be nymmed streight. O passing pretie game? Who would not blushe to see such frawde, and such fine framed knacks? Who would not hate the falsehoode vyle of these so pieuish Iackes? And (soothly if I should affirme) I beare so much deceat Of theirs in progging after gaine, as tongue can not repeat. And (as of course) I doo demaunde howe they doo spend the same? Forsooth, I heare no good they doo: No man can iustly blame Or ought accuse them of good deedes. But this my selfe can saye, That most thereof that I see spent, is on apparell gaye. For but of late, ene thus I heard a worthy Doctor say: My matters frame not as I would, Ile worke some other way. I see these weedes be not to weare. Ile henceforth so prouide, That I will haue a pretie Nagge about the Towne to ride. Ile haue a footecloath, and each thing belonging to the same: My felow Doctor hath the lyke, and passing flyes his name. A Gowne with graundcape will I haue, a swinging Ueluet Cap, A Coate according verie braue: and then ift be my hap, With mighty lookes, and learning such as God hath giuen mee, Ile hooke syr Nummus to my handes, and make the Ruddockes flee For feare almost into my purse. Ile leaue my simple gate, Ile rather frame my selfe to ride lyke one of high estate. And what? were these but scoffing words? Yes sure, hee (earnest bent) Hath so purueyde, that now he hath euen all for that intent. And thus you see with how great care they seeke t'enrich their store, You see the pride that they mayntaine through this excessiue lore. And (well I wote) none other meanes of spence at all I see, But only such as wicked are: (if any else there be.) Wherefore, it seemes they hoorde it vp and hyde it from the Sunne: They couer't close, and lock it fast tyll more thereto be wonne. They giue small almes as I can heare, for beggars barcke apace, And say that they of all men woorst relieue their wofull case: Their pride is great, and high they looke for feare of waxing lowe: Theyle giue no place to any man where ere they hap to go. I well recorde a pretie tale alluding to a truthe: I force not much to tell it you. Harke how the same ensuthe? A Ciuilian, or a Canonist, or both.Once hapt it (through a fowle mischance) that great debate did ryse Betweene a Doctor in the Law (for so th'example lyes) And Doctor (eke) of Phisick, who should haue the vpper hande In each assembly where they met to walke, to syt or stande. The Lawyer layed for him selfe and sayde well to the case, Phisition dyd full wisely to and with a goodly grace: Alledging well (euen both of them) lyke handsome learned men. But nought could be agreed vpon. So fell the matter then, That they vnto the Pretor would for to decyde the same. They made relation of the case and finely gan it frame. The Pretor when he heard the dolts contend about a Straw, Was soone content to iudge the same, and askte the man of Law Who went vnto the Gallowes first, the Hangman or the Thiefe? Who formost was of both them two and which was there the chiefe? The Hangman quoth the Lawyer tho, for he doth kyll the man: The Hangman he must go before, the Theefe must follow. Than Quoth Pretor harke. This is my minde and iudgement in the case. Phisition he must go before, and Lawy Bertulph. Why then (quoth Bertulph) by your tale Phisitions men doo kyll. And Lawyers liue by robbing men, and so their Cofers fyll. Whereby with pride emboste they swell, and whereby (raging) they T'aduaunce themselues to honors type vnlawfull meanes assay. Paule. Yea sure (quoth Paule) and so they doo a number of them now. But as for our Phisitions, their cunning knoweth how Such are the euyll sort.As well to kyll, as to purloyne: they are expert in all. And force not (so that Nummus come) which way their staffe doo fall. A Potion to cure all kinde of diseases and griefes.One hath a Potion for to serue and cure eche kinde of griefe, Heele sell a quart for fortie pence. This fellow is the chiefe And finest chylde in casting of mens waters when they neede. Heele byd the healthy get him home and make his Wyll with speede. Although he liue from that tyme long, without all kinde of paine. Heele make him doubt and dread his life, and all for filthy gaine. Carnific?is? potius Medici quàm nomine dignus.He wyll perswade that men haue lyu'de in whordome and excesse, Where neuer raigned fond affect, and whoredome much the lesse. Another is so Doltlyke seene and learnedly beguylde, That when he seeth your vrine, he wyll say you be with childe Although you be a man: for sure but hittie missie he And so full many of them play, so Bussardlike they be. O Paule, quoth Bertulph, giue mee leaue to interrupt you here. For by your patience, yle requite the tale you tolde whyle ere. Content quoth Paule (and with good wyll) I am right well apayde To heare thy tale: my talke shall cease tyll thou thy minde haue sayde. There dwelt (somtime) where I was born Bertulph. a perfite cunning man, A good Phisition well beseene: and so it happed than, That he should ryde abroade to see a Patient of his. He had a man that roade with him (a ioly Knaue ywis.) The Doctor draue his Horse apace and roade with mery cheere. He longed sore to see the place where Nummus should appeere. But as he pricked forth in haste, by chaunce he did espie A sort of Felons in a Carte adiudged there to die. And musing what y? prease should meane, he sent his man with speede, To knowe the cause of all the crowde: his man performde the deede. And posting, soone he did perceyue the Theeues to hanging prest. He turnd his Horse at sight thereof: To flye, he thought it best. And so he dyd with sturdie pace, He gallopt on his way. And as a man halfe skarde, he fled as nought might make him stay. His Maister lowdly askte the cause why he dyd ryde so fast. O Maister saue your selfe (quoth he) I vize you make good haste. The Doctor swallowde vp with feare, spurde Cut and made away. And tyll he came within a myle, his Horse did neuer stay. But when hee came vnto himselfe, he called backe his man And him demaunding cause of griefe, the fellowe thus began. O Maister, thanke we God (quoth he) for this our good escape: Else surely had we swinged both within an hempen Tape. For yonder, where the prease was so, I sawe three handsome men Which for the death of only one, were to be hanged then. But when I sawe that they (for one) were all adiudgde to dye, No neede to byd mee haste me thence, no neede to byd mee flye: For well I wyst, if you were seene which haue a number slaine, You should haue bene trust vp in haste and neare returnde againe. The Doctor being thus informde, knew not what best to say. He thought as chyldish him to take and lightly him to way. Wyse man you are no doubt, (quoth he) the Uicar of saint Fooles Go shriue you: for you haue bene taught in some well learned schooles. Paule. Shrewde foole quoth Paule, I warr?t you, but fooles and chyldren oft Doo tell the truth: for all men know their tongues are very soft. But well, no doubte, yet some there be in London (whome I know) That both do gette syr Nummus well, and well the same bestowe. That leade no doubt a vertuous lyfe, and lyue in Godly feare: That goodes to get by meanes peruerse at all times wyll forbeare. Of those I haue not talcked here, nor of the honest sort. But such as (galled) seeme to kicke, herein I doo exhort To keepe their patience when they see their faults reproued heere. For sure I am that in my tale gainst good doth nought appeere. And so I leaue them to the Lorde, and bid them all adue. My tongue in order must recorde such things as do ensue. Finis. The fourth Satyr. [Thapothecarie here I leaue] Paule. Thapothecarie here I leaue, Apothecaries &amp; Surgeons. which so for Nummus tugges, That he y? people noyes with pelfe, and filthy stincking drugges. So let I passe the Surgeon, who with his fowle deceyte, Doth hooke syr Nummus to his handes and takes him at receyte. The pelting patches will presume to practise Phisick, and Will minister lyke learned men in places of the Land. Let go such Squibs: I know them not. Yet people do complaine: And well I wote, they vse such wayes for meare intent to gaine. A rablement of raskall Roges as if weeld harrow hell, I thinke we should not finde the lyke in Plutoes house to dwell. But let them packe, Ile passe them ore. Perhaps there many be Both honest, good, and expert men, they shall goe by for me. And now yle turne me to my tale, and (as my course doth tende) Marchant men.To euyll sort of Marchaunt men the sequele wyll I bende. Lets see (I praye) howe they turmoyle and fixe their whole intent To catche syr Nummus by the coate. Let's see how they be bent And sole addicted vnto gaine. One runnes me to the Indes, Not the deede but the intent is to be misliked.To Gynnie, Spaine, and Calecut: where he such chaffare findes, As (there although it cost him small) wyll bring him here a pounde: Yea, ten perhaps, or else they lye which in such welth abounde. Another skuds me ore the Seas, and fully fraught with toyes, He brings them into London, where at length he welth enioyes. The people are so fondly bent, theyle chaunge their Cheese for chalck. And for such pelting pieuish trashe, theyle let good chaffare walck. Pueros puerilia decent.O foolishe, fonde and doltishe momes, oh men deuoyde of wit, O Capons cramde with barly corne: howe farre are stones vnfit For such pyld palting pieuish Cockes? howe yll bestowde is welth A Foole wyll not giue his bable for the Tower of London.On such new fangled fondish foltes which chaunge the same for pelth? One bringes mee ore a painted Priest, another bringes a Nunne, And shops are fraught with toyes, wherewith are English people wonne. Another grounded well in wealth, (acquainted with the guyse) Doth bring vs in such daynties, as the man can best deuise. Some else there be, and many such (chiefe Marchaunts in the Towne) That for our Peacocks plumes doo bring and sylcks the streame adowne: They knowe the Lawes doo lymit where, and what such should be worne, And they such Lawes to execute, haue eftsoones office borne. And yet for that their gaine is such and wealth so great therby, They must forbeare, and wincking walk. The Lawes must lawlesse lye: And Uarlets vaunt about the streate, lyke men of high estate: Their Hosen strowting forth with silcke, and plumes vpon their pate. The Raskalles now must roame abroade lyke men of honest port: And Strumpets stately in attire lyke Ladies mint resort To places where them selues thinke best without all kinde of doubt: They customde are about the Towne and shall be borne out. It seemeth so vndoubtedly: for nothing is amended. Although the Lawes haue sharply see and punishment extended. Nowe, other some vagaries fetch abroade I wote ner where, Such as bring them in for intent aforesayde are to be blamed.And they bring in most pleasaunt spice with Hops and other geare: These make fine mouthed Gentlemen. For who but Marchaunts now? Who wallow more in wealth than they lyke peeres I wote ner how? I speake not of the trade but of the corruption of the trade &amp; abuse of the same.Yea, who are they but Marchauntmen that haue the costly fare? Who now in banquets with these men are able to compare? For such straunge store of diuers meates and dishes finely wrought? Who hath the lyke? no man besides. Welnigh it costes them nought. They sell so deare and take such gaine, that well they may afoorde To set fine Marchpanes and such lyke vpon their seruaunts boorde. Thus may we see these kinde of men how they for Nummus prodde: A man would thinke that soothly they take Nummus for a Godde. They labor so with might and maine, Although they haue money in such price, yet euyll gotten goodes shall be ill spent.they so besturre their stumpes. They exercise such ackward wayes to bring it in by lumps. They scratch, they scrape, they mise, they muse at night when they should rest. They searche their senses and bethinke howe to obteyne it best. And ah alas, some do deuise to let it out for gaine: Such gaine as at the length will bring to them infernall paine. And (not content with fowle deceyt that they in sale do vse) Some of them do in lone alas their countrymen abuse. Let Preachers crye and tell them ont, but nothing will preuayle: They flocke, they floute, and iest at it. They bid them kisse their tayle. They haue no shame, but (brasen fasde) A lamentable cal[illeg.].they stick not it to call A gainesome Occupation. And so the people fall From honest state, to plaine banckrowte through such their Wooluish wayes. The Commons neare were so opprest as in these wofull dayes. They hooke, they hawke for Nummus so, they cogge, they foyst and powle, They lay such snares by broking meanes, that thus they Nummus towle. A thousande meanes sinistre, they account and call exchaunge, Although thereby be men vndone: the case is verie straunge. And wofull tys no doubt to see how lightly they do way Th'account which must be made by them to God another day. They are right wise in worldly wytte: surpassing is their braine. But oh, they do applie the same to nothing else but gaine. And when they haat, how is it spent? Attende a whyle, and you Shall haue it layde before your eyes and set vnto the vew. This day, my Lorde his speciall friende must dyne with him (no naye) His Partners, Friendes and Aldermen: wherefore he must puruaye Both Capon, Swan, and Hernshoe good, fat Bitture, Larcke and Quayle: Right Plouer, Snype, and Woodcock fine with Curlew, Wype and Rayle: Stonetiuets, Teale, and Pecteales good, with Busterd fat and plum, Fat Pheasaunt Powt, and Plouer base for them that after come. Stent, Stockard, Stampine, T?terueale, and Wigeon of the best: Puyt, Partrich, Blackbirde and fat Shoueler with the rest. Two Warrants eke he must prouide to haue some Uenson fat. And meanes heele make for red Deere too, (there is no nay of that.) And needefully he must prouide (although we speake not ont) Both Peacock, Crane, and Turkicock, and (as such men are wont.) He must foresee that he ne lacke colde bakemeates in the ende: With Custards, Tarts, and Florentines, the bancquet to amende. And (to be short and knit it vp) he must not wanting see Straunge kindes of fysh at second course to come in their degree. As Porpesse, Seale and Salmond good with Sturgeon of the best And Turbot, Lobster, with the lyke to furnish out the feast. All this theyle haue, and else much more, sydes Marchpane and greene Cheese, Stewde wardens, Prunes, &amp; sweete conserues with spiced Wine like Lees. Greeneginger, Sucket, Suger Plate, and Marmaladie fine: Blauncht Almonds, Peares and Ginger bread. But Peares should we assigne And place before (as meete it is) at great mens boordes: for why, Rawe fruites are first in seruice styll, Else Seruing men doo lye. But now me thinkes, one quips me vp and spurs a question heere. He sayes (forsooth) that I mislike to haue men keepe good cheere. In deede, the stomack ouerchardgde and man full gorgde with meate, Doth make the minde and inwarde man vnfit for reasons seate. For chaunge no doubt annoyes the man, and meate not well indewde, Doth make the same scant halfe a man if reason be renewde. And what of this? shoulde this reformde, house keeping now depell? No sure, for hospitalitie becomth them very well. But that this cheere is alway such, I plainely do deny. Some feast great men for frendship sake, and let the poore go by. They rather doot to oppresse the poore, and by such friendship got, The poore haue nought within their hands which they get to them not. For what through frendship welth &amp; force no one enioyes the thing, That (if they lyke) some will not soone into their clouches bring. But goods yll gote, are euyll spent. And howe can they bestowe Their welth on poore and Preachers true Which through deceyt did growe? No fie, t'were shame and fowle reproche t'aue beggers at their borde: An't seemes (some think) all yll bestowde that's spent t'encrease Gods worde. For (worse then this) some cannot byde t'aue beggers at their gate, Nor not repine when Preachers lyue in meane and simple state. O Labirinths of lothsome lust, O hellish humane harts, O beastly belching bely gods that thus their store conuarts: O lumpishe Luskes, that lieffer had to haue of Uiands store: To winne the Rytchman, then to feede the begger at their dore. O stony harts, that more esteeme a Monckey tyde with chaine, Then their poore brother, for whose sake Christe Iesus sufferde paine. O wicked Wights of wooluish kinde, which so the Lambes deuowre, And cr?ckly cram themselues with spoyle of needy soules each howre. And (more then this:) for how doth walck Sir Nummus day by daye? How trudgeth it to buy the Wife and Daughter fine arraye? They must not go as other doo. Wherefore, they must deuise To haue them knowne from c?mon sort by some newfangled guise. T'is meete therefore, as they do not with courtlyke Dames compare, Euen so they should from townish wiues their garments new repaire. And so (forsooth) his wife must haue prepared out of hand, Gaye garments of the finest stuffe that is within the land. She must haue Partlet, Square &amp; Lace, with Chaine about hir neck: She must haue costly kinde of chaunge, and all thinges at hir beck. Hir Daughter also must be clad well lyke a Ladies feere, And all to walcke about the streate with hir true Louer deere. What tho? Forsooth, she must not wed but with some wealthie man, And one that must be grounded rych, though honest when he can. And thus I say (aswell t'is seene) fayre Parnell must be pranckt And walcke at wyll: whereby it haps oft tymes that she is banckte. And all through meanes euen of hir Sire which so consumes his good, And ioyes therein, more then to giue the hungrie wretch his foode. Chaunce some men see good deedes they do. But in good sooth not I (Though many naught) can vnderstand. T'were sinne on them to lye. And nowe, as some you see to scrape by vyle sinistre wayes: So may you see them spend as yll in these our later dayes. I meane for so much as they spend. But well haue we to weete, Their hoording and their Chesting vp is all as farre vnmeete As this their spence and filthy trade, as this their prowling guise, As this their building all for gaine and profite to aryse: As this their hatefull vyle contempt of poore and needy Wights: As this their robbing and their stealth. As these their sinfull slights. The poore complaine and wanting, crye through hunger halfe forepinde: And some through want, about them haue their fainting breath resignd. And yet their Cofers farced lye. Their Bags are filde at full. But wote you what? it is reseru'de For Tib his pretie Trull, And Dick his Boy that dappart ladde: which for his sake, perchaunce Euen both of them, when he is gone, wyll make syr Nummus daunce. But alwayes this is not the cause of such their spitefull hoord. For certs I thinke they neuer looke at all to come aboord In crooked Charons vgly Boate: Or else perhaps they thinke (As long they haue) the Pope shall purge and saue them all for chinke. And in the meane time weene they best to couer't close and fine, And bring more toot, t'encrease the heape. This iudgement is of mine. Else thinges amisse, before exprest, should nere so yll remaine, But soone they would reforme them well and make them streight againe. Which so to do, God graunt them grace. And clense their fylthie mindes: That Auarice maye once decay which so their body bindes, And subiect makes to vyle deuise, to Usurie and deceate, That naught they are, and wyll persist tyll grace do blow retreate. I ende with them: protesting styll I touch no good man heere, But such as through these words of mine shall wrathfull bent appeere. For sure I am that many iust, and men vpright remaine, Exempted from this talke of mine. Who neuer yet with staine Or spot of beastly Usurie or vile notorious vice, Were once corrupted or infect. which are discrete and wise. And (truth it is) they nill disdaine at this troth telling tale. And for the rest, let them adue, my tongue must further vale. Finis. The fift Satyr. [Tis stra?ge to see what small account] Tis stra?ge to see what small account men nowe a dayes do make: How slightly they let slip the paine of Brimstone burning lake. How fondly they perswade them selues (at least how they suppose) That griesly death shall neuer strike. That eyne shall neuer close. O sottish sinfull brittle age. O mad and blockish Mome. O doltish foole, and wilfull wretch that here dost hope for home And dwelling aye vnto thy selfe. Howe art thou wilfull blinde? I tell thee, I, thou hence shalt flit lyke dust blowne forth with winde. Let wearish wimpled age growe on: let head be hoarie white, And olde be thou: yet at the last blackwinged death shall smite. But what is he can promise heere him selfe to liue a day? No doubt not one. Death vnawares shall take our life away. And when we thinke vs surest, then most often doth he strike. O then why do we lyngre on to sleepie sluggerds lyke? O, why should men thus mucker vp such falsely gotten gaine? Or why should they by wicked wayes seeke wealth for to obtaine? Banckrowtes.But soft a while, what neede these words? as good to holde my peace: For loe how Banckrowts ginne for gaine to put them selues in prease. Shall fraude lye hid vnfriended now? Shall fowle Deceyt be gon? Shall Wylie want? No, harcke a while, and you shall heare anon. Some men there be that beare a porte, and liue lyke to the best. That feast, y? flow, that chop, that cha?ge, and practise with the rest. I haue made a dyfference betweene the wilfull and the c?trarie.That Office beare, and worthy seeme through welth to weelde the charge. That saue, that spende, &amp; bargaines make, that keepe their trade at large. That war?t?e worste, and winde to them good credite in the ende. That get such friendes as wyll not stick a thousand pound to lende. Oft more oft lesse: almost as much as they can well demaunde. For why, their credite now is such, that they may men commaunde. But what of this? Euen this forsooth. Theyle shut vp doore anon, Theyle giue vp office, trade and all: farewell, they will be gone. When they haue gote the most they can, they wyll become banckrowte, They wyll no longer styfeled be amongst the honest rowte. They can no longer byde the trade which honest men do vse. They keepe at home amongst their bags, Theyle honesty refuse. Theyle lurking lye lyke Theefe in denne, lyke Drane vpon the spoyle. Theyle grease their lips, &amp; fat their pa?ch, with honest Marchaunts toyle. O dreyrie dregges of dampishe caue, O fowle infernall fiendes, O tryple stinged Uipers broode, O hagges of hellishe mindes. O Cyclops such as styll deuoure the sheepe of forreine foldes, O brockish beastes with rauine gorgde: that lurcke within their holdes. Shall duskie drosse of Dytis caue denie infecting death? Shall Oreus spare with skalding skortch to noye their vitall breath? No sure, the pitchie burning pit, and Limboes flaming Lake Shall yolpe them vp, except they yeelde the goodes which they did take. Or else to powre requite the same. But this they neuer thinck: For marck how they do still bestowe this beastly gotten chinck. And here I must aduertise you that some besides there bee Which oft by meanes becom banckrowte (as dayly we may see.) For some exceede and so abounde in Epicureous fare, That so at length they banckrowte be and bring them selues full bare. And othersome through great excesse and prowde surpassing charge. In braue arraye do bring them selues into Cock lorrels Barge. When ere sawe you their Dames so nice, and wiues so richly clad? When wist yon Women ere so proude, or Husbandes ere so mad? O where are Matrones now become? O where are Husbands graue? Where are y? Wiues that tooke such care their honesty to saue? Woulde Matrones walcke or Wiues discreet with syluer shining browes From streat to streat? no, rather they would keepe within their howse. Would Matrons skud to common games and prancke in earie prease? No, tys to vyle, I loath to tell. Ile therefore holde my peace. Tys this, tys this, y? Banckrowts breede. This brings the wife yll name. The husband thus is bare through spence, and wife naught by the same. And nowe you see a difference tweene him that banckrowte is Of vyle intent, and him that falles through great excesse of his. But both of these perhaps a lyke by fraude haue Nummus gote, Though both in care and wanting pine syng not lyke dolefull note. And nowe, (as to my promise made at fyrst when I began) Fooles and Roysters.Ile place syr Nummus caught by Fooles and Roysters now and than. A wise man dyes, and welthy leaues his sonne in goodes and lands. The young man (when he is of age) takes all into his handes. And streight to Court, or Innes of Court, he goes to leade his lyfe) Where franck he is, and youthfull bent for why, haas Nummus ryfe. Or else, if not: So he han lande or ought that's Money worth, He shall not want of Marchauntmen fine silcks to set him forth. Nor Money will they stick at all to lende him at his neede. As long as ought he doth possesse, theyle neuer cease to feede My yonker and yong Maister so. And he (when once he sees The bridle layde vpon his necke) is loath much time to leese. For why, he wisht it long before: And sith he doth espie The matter wholy in his handes, why should he longer lye Lyke blunt Iohn Whoball all at home? No fie, heele haste him now. Both lybertie and Chinck ynough himselfe he will allow. And streightway (else the world is hard) He meetes with Copesmates, such As to exalt and set him forth, at all will nothing grutch. And hee forsooth must foremost be in euery braue attempt. Who eare be one, yong Maister must at no time be exempt. Heele be the chiefe within the Maske and chiefe in bancquet: hee Shall syt exalted to the Sunne, Euen to the tenth degree. And now and then (else scapes he well) heele haue a spyrt at Dice. He wantes no mates to bring him too't by slight and fine deuice. He must haue walkinges in the night: he must be braue and fine. He must be of the hoygh no doubt. He neuer must repine Although it be to sit it oute all night in costly game. And (more then this) he must not stick to paye for all the same. And when he seemely seemeth once, and thinks well of himselfe, Then, then no doubt he is stird vp to spende this noysome pelfe. And then (I saye) with posting speede he must be gaylie dect In colours of his Ladie, and therein not ought neglect That's incident to euery sute: Of chaunge he must haue store, And frame himselfe full scatly then to euery lusty lore. And doubtlesse then he is so drownde in pleasure and in pride, That nought at all may him withdrawe: It hath bene often tride. Yea, though at length he feele great smart through that he made away: Yet is his minde so hawtie then, that he can make no stay. For wote you what, vse custome brings, and yongker thus doth say: Shall I make spare whyle ought is left and so lyue wanting? Naye, It were a shame and great reproche, if I that euer haue As yet lyu'de lyke a Gentleman, should now lyue like a slaue. And so my chylde no chaungling is, tyll all be spent and gone: And till his mates him needie leaue and comfortlesse alone. From which time forth if ought he haue, whereof may Nummus ryse: He will lyue shifting til't be gone. Then forth of Towne he flyes And keepes the high way side (perchaunce) to lyue by theft and spoyle: Till Tyborne twitch him by the neck and Hangman giue the foyle. So that's the ende of all his wealth and ending of the man. But goods perhaps were euill gote: and who can maruaile than Though that the same were all consumde in filthy vaine exspence? And who will doubt that gallowes should such Dingthrifts recompence? But one thing I do here lament and tys most wicked sure, Tys noysome, vyle and beastly trade, yet most of all in vre. A Gentleman his childe doth sende t'apply his studies here, With hope to haue him do the same as daylie doth appere. The youth oft tymes declyneth streight as apt to youthly guise: And sets his minde to make him braue with all he may deuise. The Citizen when that he sees the bruite so brauely bent, Doth closely search the yong mans state, and learnes the whole extent Of all his possibilitie, which knowne, he will not spare For friendship sake vnto the same of loane to let his ware. The yong man hauing welth at wyll and all thinges at request, Byds booke adue, and cuts it out as brauelie as the best. How vyle this is, let all men iudge. how oft it comes to passe, The yongmen brought to naught therby, are witnesses alas. Oh, where is loue or feare of God? Wher's faith for to be found? Wher's friendship, truth and honestie? Where doth not Fame resound The beastly pranckes of wicked men? Wher's one that thinks of God? Wher's one that doubts or feareth ought the sharpnesse of his rod? How few be there that tread the pathes or trace Dame vertues steps? How many rather be there now that quite from vertue leps? O wofull case: the best almost do much account it now If they from vile notorious faultes at any time do bow. How talke our tatlers of the truth and Scripture still discusse? How lyue they quite contrarie yet for all their talking thus? How earnest bent are men as now to heare the worde of God? (I meane professors of the trueth.) How farre yet liue they od? They crie Lord Lord, and God be praysde: but streight within an howre, That heate of theirs is colde as stone. Such heate hath made them sowre. O thou good God and Father kinde: were not thy mercies great, Thou wouldst destroy these men with fire from thy supernall seat. O heauenlie Prince of glorie: and O thou alone Iehoue, Thou God of grace, oh louing Christ, yond whome we can not roaue Or raunge aright: yond whome no man can perfite blisse attaine: Thou only one, and all in one, yond whome doth nought remaine: Giue grace vnto thy wandring sheepe. Fetch home the same againe, Sith blood of thine hath them redeemde from sharpe infernall paine. Graunt graunt (O God) thy holy spreete to guide, defend and keepe All such as in most lothsome sinne, are yet not falne a sleepe. Saue thine elect from noysome trade of worldly minded men: Let not the custome of the worlde their lyfe with vices blen. From place to place, from streat to streat, from house to house, alas: Yea, and well nigh from man to man doth sinfull lyuing passe. Not words preuaile, nor preaching ought, can turne the peoples harts: No kinde of thing can moue their minds. O, death is their desarts, O, Hell their hire, and burning flame, is guerdon of their deedes: No one almost in hart doth beare the true repentaunt seedes. O, horror doth possesse my heade, And whyle through towne I trace, Deepe cutting cares annoy my hart. to see such want of grace. No sparckle, iote or small remaine, no signe of godly feare, No badge at all of christen men doth any person weare Or keepe almost throughout the Towne, O, what a case is this, Not one to finde that feareth God, but all to do amisse? And all to wander from good lyfe (full few alas exempt) And all to worke that wicked is and beastly vile attempt? O God, howe often do I wishe to be deuided cleane From all the dealings in the worlde, and to God only leane? How often do I seeke some trade, and solitarie lyfe. How fayne would I depart the place where sinnes be now so ryfe. The world doth tempt, &amp; nought remains in his due practise now: Eche kinde of trade corrupted is, alas, I know not how. Nothing almost is exercisde without some vile deceyt: Fraude, falsehood, theft and pilfring, oft in matters are of weyght. The worldlings weene &amp; thinke no doubt there is none other place But ground and graue, and so they runne and keepe their woonted race. What helpen teares or wayling griefe? what ought at all preuayles Gods worde sincere? They keepe theyr course: they haue set vp theyr sayles Of deadly sinnes and hatefull hellish lyfe. They runne and will not stay. They keepe themselues in darksom holes. They hate to see the day. Looke looke throughout their dealings all, and you shall nothing finde But couen, craft, and fylthy lore. They haue good lyfe resignde. Lets sift &amp; searche our selues throughout. Lets rippe our inwarde man: Let's way our selues eu? with our selues. And we shall see vs than, And finde our selues but drosse and death and fowle infected Swine. Most vgsome shapes, and creatures, such as I can not define. What faith in bargaines can be found? What store of othes must bee In eche compact? And yet in ende what falsehod do we see? Not Marchaunt vseth onely fraude: nor men of greatest meede. But eche one now that bargaine makes, hath falsehod in his deede. How oft and daylie haps it now that chyldren do begin Where Parents ended, and do ende where Parents did begin? The parents beggers first began, They ende great men of wealth. The sonne begins a welthy man: and endes his lyfe by stealth, Or wofull wanting simple state. How oft comes this to passe? Tys daylie seene of common course. it happeth still alas. Shall welth that's woonne by fraude, be kept? shall riches such descende From heire to heire? No no, such welth shall quickly haue an ende. It cannot bide, nor prosper well. But who doth that regarde? Who yet for welth most vyle deceyt at any tyme hath sparde? No one well nighe: (the world is such.) And here doth come to minde The passing pride in common sort which now eche where we finde. Such is their rage, and fowle affect, that though their bellies want: Their backs must brauely clothed be: apparell nothing scant. For what cause else they do reserue eche where the Saboth day, But for to iette about the streates in passing braue array? The welthy sort exceede their state, and meane degree the same: The common sort wyll do the lyke. So all goes out of frame: And Roysters ruffle all about and tosse the Bylbow blade, And to maintaine such vyle excesse, beholde what shifts be made? Such cogging, foysting, cossening: such fylching, theft and guile: Such pelting, pylfring, pieuish drifts, as are almost to vyle And beastly to be named once. Ile therefore silent bee: For sure I am such lyfe of theirs all men may plainly see. Ther's brothel baytes, &amp; whoring d?nes: Ther's lurcking strumpets lodge: Ther's stuffe eche where for lusty Swash for Simkin, Dick, and Hodge. Looke looke the Lanes about the Towne, and search eche corner through: And you shall finde I doubt not I of broken ware ynough: Corrupt at least much seemes to be: so brightly shine the browes, So prickt &amp; pranckt, so lyckt and trimde is Banckrowtes pretie spowse. Search Tauernes through, and typling bowres, eche Saboth day at morne: And you shall thinke this geare to be ene too too much forborne. Take care a whyle to vew the Skowtes, and wanton walking trulles: And you shall see howe suffraunce nowe good lyfe awayward pulles. What should I saye? Marke eche where well, and you shall vnderstande And plainely see how sinne is sparde and cloked vnder hande. Beare bayting on the Saboth day.What else but gaine and Money gote maintaines each Saboth day The bayting of the Beare and Bull? What brings this brutish play? What is the cause that it is borne, and not controlled ought, Although the same of custome be, on holy Saboth wrought? Now sure I thinke tys gaine or spite, gainst good and godly lyfe: It seemes it is t'ynuegle men, whyles Gods worde is so ryfe: I cannot any where perceyue where gaine is gotten well: I can not see where well tys spent. I thinke no man can tell Or iustlie saye, here goeth one (for most part now I meane) That iustly lyues and leades his lyfe: that doth to vertue leane. But well, to God I leaue this geare, I haue bene somewhat long: Ile turne my tale to other talke: Ile sing some other song. Finis. The syxt Satyr. [What think you (Bertulph) of this place] What think you (Bertulph) of this place Powles Church abused. (this Church of Powles I meane) How thinke you of th'abuses here, In talke and tales vncleane, In fearefull oathes and vile compacts, in vaine expence of winde, In vilely spending tyme therein, in ydle chat to finde Men occupyde at prayer time, and other tymes vnmeete, In toyes, and diuers noysome trades? (As thou thy selfe dost weete.) And soothly tell mee, what thou deemst, and how it seemes to thee, In place reseru'de to heare Gods worde, such Chaos vyle to see? Bertulph. Of truth, to shew my minde therin (at least what I haue seene) The tyme (as now) wyll not permit: tys to farre spent I weene. Againe, sith you haue well begonne of Nummus to intreate, T'were pitie (sure) that want of tyme should let you to repeate Such things againe with briefe discourse, of well proposed Theame: Returne therfore, and make some ende of this thy faithfull dreame. And I at else appointed time (for time it doth demaunde) Will nothing fayle, in eche respect, wherein you shall commaunde. Paule. Well, well (quoth Paule) so shall it be. Ile ende my tale begonne. Ile not be long: giue silent eare, the same shall soone be donne. And now, besides the great abuse that I whileare did name, Here in this Temple (day by daye) themselues do likewise frame Gentlem?.A number of our forraine Feeres and men of grounded welth, Our cawtie countrey Gentlemen to wyn this noysome pelth. The fertile soyle that foyson bringes of goodly sheaued graine, The Medow ground that plenty yeeldes of Haye through little paine, And ranckly springing pasture, which doth fat the fleesed sheepe, Will not suffice their greedy mindes, nor them contented keepe. Not gaine inough by gainsome trade, to them will now arise, Nor welth inough can quench their thirst: too much will not suffise Or stay their lust: styll lust they more. Not highly raysed rents Not lofty fines can humors purge, nor extreame whole extents Can fyll their hungrie gaping gulles, nor staunch their fowle desire. They are so fell, that more they haue, the more they do require. Their Gra?dsires great, of l?g time since, their Auncestors of yore, With sole reuenewes of their lands, haue maintainde euermore Right worthy portes, forgetting nought the stay of their good name: Well gote they welth, in bountie, and well spent they still the same. They neuer (most of them I meane) encrocht on neighbors ground, Nor ere inclosde vniustly ought, They lyu'd within the bound Of Charitie and reasons lawe, contented with their owne. They fedde within their Tedure still: fowle fraude was then vnknowne. At least the fraude that's nowe in vre. They neare enhaunst their rentes, Nor found such beastly practises as this vyle age inuents. Their own suffisde: they sought no more, they lyu'de well of the same: Yet lyu'de they not vnto themselues, as their successors frame. They well could byde that beggers should haue comfort at their gate: They were c?tent, though that they dwelt by men of meane estate. But now not so. That Age is spent, and Charitie withall: These men are not contented now: to spoyle eche one doth fall. They racking stretch their liuing so: such wooluish wayes they frame, That through fine force, &amp; pilfring shifts, twise doubled are the same. And double twise decayed yet howsekeping is no doubt. They liue lyke Misers to them selues. Their neighbours rounde about Of poore estate may not approche nor come within their gates: Sometimes perhaps for fashion sake they doe inuite their Mates, And such as doe the lyke to them: or else by whome dooth ryse Some hope of gayne or getting ought. And thus their bountie lyes. But this not all: for wote you what? They shame not now to say That beggers doe so eate them vp, that they no longer maye Be able to keepe ope their doores, nor howsekeping maintaine. Perhaps they see some other trade where lyes some greater gaine. And soe they doe, for when they haue once gotten to their handes By purchase, fraude, and subtile meane their needy neighbours landes About them rounde (whereby of trueth they come to great decaye) Then shut they doores &amp; howsehold breake they turne their men away. And hither come they tag and ragge: here must the gaine be had: Here be their charges verie slight: yet pelting twise as bad As eare it was. The Countrie house is broken vp through charge, The lands are let, and fines are raysde: whereby comes in at large Userers are Caterpillers in a comon wealthGraund s?mes of Coine: which gott? once is straight to London brought To bring increase. (O hellish trade) and thus the meanes are wrought. In bancke is layde the mightie Masses the gaine whereof may bee Enough to maintaine them at ease, Nay thalfe thereof we see Doth well suffice: for but one man or two at most they haue. And they themselues doe Tables haunt, and so sir Nummus saue. And at a meane and slender price, themselues, their men and all, Haue meate and drinke euen of the best well serued at their call: And with reuenewes of the stock, right richly are they clad. And so from thence their brauing state and all the rest is had. The sterke as whole reserued still. and oft (such is the trade) That fr? the graund stock flowes so much as petie stockes are made. And here the caterpillers haunt. In Powles forsooth they vse To spende the day to make their mart and hearken after newes. Was euer seene such state confusde, such monstrous kinde of men, Such vomite, reffize, Dunghill drosse? what man can tell me when such watch, such ward, such winking wiles were euer put in vre In time to fore, or such foule fraude sir Nummus to procure? In faith, and by my sauing health, full hardly can I finde A man amongst a number now of vncorrupted minde, And such a one as hope of gaine will not procure to sinne. I think full fewe be lyuing now whome meede may nothing winne: Or whome that wealth may neuer winde from Gods prescribed lawe. O earth, O sinne, Oh Sathans thralles: Howe doe we still withdrawe The grace and loue of God from vs? O how doe we regarde More, noysome coyne, then helth of soule or hope of good rewarde? I thinke if I could perseuers one Month in this my tale, I scantly should the halfe discrie Of fraude, (for why) in sale And eche compact, the sole regarde of gaine is alway had: And thirst of score, eache where almost doth make the people mad. O where are bits to bring them in, and lawes to lay their rage? O where is faith, or feare of God in this presumptuous age? Eache one dooth liue as lykes him best, the lawes doe lye for gayne. Besides deceit and vile deuise, dooth nothing now remaine Within the harts of English men, farre fled is all remorse: All loue of God, all feare of plague, and Keysers mightie force. Papistes.How prodde our Papistes priuily? How doe these men puruaye? How prowle the Caytiues now about, for Nummus day by daye? Here, in this Church a walck there is The Papistes walke in Powles.where Papistes doe frequent To talke of newes among themselues: and oft the time is spent In glad recounting of their state: which though not at the best, Yet ioy they still to see how men in ayde thereof be prest. The walke is in the south Ile.And now comes one and cheeres them vp, he telles them with great ioy, That Pope and Spaniard ioyned be, Gods people to annoy. By solempne protestation comes an other by and by He tels how that in Flaunders still, the Gospellers doe dye For sole professing of the truth: and with a cheerefull face, He shewes how fast the Sheepe are slaine, abroade in eary place. And what great townes are now besiegde and Cities rounde about. And how Gods worde decayes apace, euen all the worlde throughout. Another new fonde fellow comes, and he beginnes to tell How Popishe Champions landed are, and Irish men rebell. How holye fathers blessing brought in Bishops sacred breste, Hath made the lande before profane, nowe holy as the reste. And how that Stukeley lost his life, among Barbariens late, A Marquesse of the Romish marke, O too vntimely fate: His part (alas) was yet to play in places neerer hande. He ment and bent his forces he, against the Irish lande, But what this Marquesse left vndone, Mack Morice he contryu'd: And hotly gan pursue the charge, But ah, it neuer thryu'd. For Martyrlyke he lost his head, a losse (in deede) to wayle: Sithe holy Father, through this losie, Haue you not seene the knacke to knowe knaues by. compiled by many knaues?of his intent dooth fayle. Great Sacks of newes are poured forth in that same worthy walke. And knauish knackes are there deuisde whilst that they stately stalck About the place lyke honest men, and subiects true of hart. From that same place doe rumors rise Gods truth to ouerthwart. From that same place doe slaunders come and vile reprochful lyes Against Gods word and Preachers true. From that same corner flyes Lewde skoffing iestes and taunting tales: there doe these Rebels coyne Their suttle drifts and noysome tales. Yea, there doe they conioyne, And cleaue like burres with solemne vow the truth for to resist. And doubt thers none, for why? I thinke that they will so persist. Untill that Sathan snatch them hence, the Graundsire great of lyes: And till through want of vitall breath, they may no more deuise. Bertulph. What kinde of men be these (I praye) that thus themselues in vre? What, are they open foes profest that by these meanes procure The slaunder of the certaine truth and teachers of the same, Or Ipocrites that couertly the Ghospell doe diffame? Paule. Once, Bertulph, tys well knowne to thee that small restraint there is For papistes tongues that proudly prate, (how ere they gabbe amisse.) They talke from feare of check at large. But yet of them there bee That prease amongst professors true, and well with them agree. For why, their lyuings so doe lye, that but they seemed such, They neuer coulde aspire so high, nor yet obtaine so much As now they doe. O Ianus Iacks and double faced Dogs? O wylie wincking wyzard Woolues, O grunting groyning Hogs? These men (I say) forsweare them selues (As periurde Papistes do.) They graunt the Queene is supreme head and murmure at it to. But what of that, fine filed heads well fraught with trim deuise And ciuile sleights, without remorse, suche scruples count vnwise. And so through sharpe and wylie wits, And through farre fetching braines, They mount aloft to honors tipe, and come by greatest gaines. And these be they that vnder hande the trueth do still annoy, And let the working of the worde in such as might enioy The sweetest salue of sauing health. Such lay the lothsome snares, And when good seede is sowne, forthwith such men sowe noysome tares. Yea, such I say (as to my tale) lay waite by wylie wayes For Nummus: and to get the same, are prest at all assayes. These be supporting purueyors for Papistes nowe supprest These ranckly feede the pamperd Swyne vpstalled in their nest. These foyson bring, and brokers set through bend of popishe crew, And these men foster Balamites To whome reuenge is dew. These men are sole abettors of the cursed Priests of Baall: And these men shauelings doe suffulse, which else wolde haue a fall. Ist meruaile though they cranckly crowe well lodged in their cage? With prouen prickt, yst meruaile now, That thus the Tigars rage? What neede haue they to yelde th?selues vnto their lawfull Queene? For what intent should subiectes they at any time be seene? They want nothing, no pleasant lodge: of viands they abounde, Both Uenson, Wine, and finest cates. almoste that may be founde They doe enioy: yea, and such store as true report doth saye, That (rather than the poore shoulde haat) they cast their scraps awaye. And in good sooth, their welth is such and dainty fare so ryfe, That worldlings wil not blame their wit to leade such captiue lyfe. And fooles they were if they woulde not be persecuted so: Yea some of them so sore be hurt that broade they ryde and go. They walke and wallow at their will: they hawke and hunt yfeere With such as haue the charge of them: they quaffe and make good cheere, Set Cock on hoope, with hoape that once, a daye shall paye for all: Meane time they wil not die through care nor from their treason fall. Bertulph. Why Pawle (quoth Bertulph) mercy will perhaps so pierce their hart, That through the mercye of the Prince they will to trueth conuart. Paule. Nay Bertulph, tys so farre that they with mercye shoulde be wonne, That vauntingly they bragge and saye bounde dutie will haue done All that is done: and (thus) they crake that if the Queene by lawe Or conscience coulde them gyltie dampne, she woulde not stande in awe To send them to their doome: nor to restraine their tongues so loose. Thus bleate the Popish Balamites, thus creakes the Romishe goose. And what, should merrie here be shewde, or can the same preuaile? No no, as long as mercy is, their tongues shall neuer quaile, Nor harte obdured once relent: nor common state be sounde. For how can gentle salue doe good or cure the festred wounde? How can the body be in health, I meane those of th? only that haue bene distained with the bloude of the Lordes Saintes.that is with Biles infect? Or Tree spr?g well that hath dead spraies vnlesse you doe resect The braunches of? What man so mad will shewe himselfe to bee, As ought to hope for leaues or fruite to come from rotten Tree? How can the state of Christ his flock, be fenced from decay: Unlesse the higher powers doe cast the stumbling stocks away? How can the Lord of truth be pleasde, when such false Prophets liue? How will he like to haue them kept his siely Lambes to grieue? And doubt the Tiraunts now to say that time shall come againe Wherein the blessed Saints of God by them shall suffer paine? No no, they feare not to protest, that where they put to death Of late but few, for earye such shall twentie loose their breath In time to come. O bloudie beastes and foule infected Swine? But these be they for whom (no doubt) men scrape and so purloine: For whome these factors haue such care and passing great regard: For whom they powle the Preachers true these Monsters to reward. And hate of theirs so haynous is, their rancor hath such force Against the Ghospell of the Lorde, that (voyde of all remorse) They eft procure Pluralities For vile disguised Iacks. They glad and ioy, to see the Church sustaine such wofull lacks. And they againe, a Priesting sort, attyred in theyr kinde: Doe creepe into Cathedrall Celles. theyr charge they haue assignde, To be dischargde per auters mains, themselues will liue at ease, They force not what become of flock, so they sir Nummus sease. And Nummus do they seise in deede, which seised buyldes no Schooles: Nor makes no stockes for men decayde, no Bertulph so playes fooles. But here you may not take me so as if I did defase Without respect, the good with badde in eache Cathedrall place. Much lesse that I depraued haue all Preachers so attyrde In Priestish weedes, as Popelings were, and as theyr state requyrde. No: farre and farre, be this from me, for why I knowe right well: That in these Priestish weedes there are, full many that excell. Naye Bertulph naye, then blame haue I if so my wordes be meante: For some of these attyred thus, in peacefull wise are bent: And brawle not with their brethren, who neglecte or cleane refuse: And therefore great vniustice t'were, such Preachers to accuse. Although I wishe (that's all I maye,) that Preachers might be knowne From Popish Iacks in weedes and words a thing confused growne. But husht, Ile haste me to the shore: Ile shonne such mounting waues. Ile leaue this Sea for to be swomme of tryple tongued Naues. FINIS. The seauenth Satyr. [Now harken Bertulph to the ende] Paule. Now harken Bertulph to the ende of this my present tale. I am enforst my floting Boate to shore from course to hale. The time runnes on, the day is spent, The night awayward pulles, And endlesse scope of my pretence, downe pressed pallate dulles. O endlesse powre, O welspring, whence all wisedome wisely flowes: O God, whose grace doeth guide the good, in whome all bounty growes: Thou knowst the harts, &amp; seest the raynes yea, thinwarde thoughts of men Doe open lye before thy face: Thou knowst how, where and when Ech thing hath, is, or shall be done or else committed: thou Haste perfite vewe and insight good which waye mans hart doth bow. Thou, thou, I say, sole God of might, beholdst the harts of men, What they pretend, what yll they worke: so iustly iudge me then, And shut thy mercy from my soule, if slaundrously my lyps Doe ope at all: or if my tongue of vaine presumption skyps From this to that, or rashly run more then the truth doth vrge, Or more then that through extreame rage and force of sinfull surge I am constrainde with deepe remorse and moaning plaint to tell. O, oh, how many brothell Bawdes within the towne doe dwell? How many filthy scudding scowtes, besturre their crooked stumpes? For gaine, for gaine, olde mother B how shee still lymping lumps, And proddes about with ackwarde pace vnto her beastly haunt? How doe these subtile groyning Sowes poore siely girles enchaunt, And oft abet the loued spouse to start from husbands bed? Beholde I saye, how by these Bawdes, are women captiue led And simple maydes vnto the spoyle. Beholde and see their trade, See, see, what wyly winking shiftes, by cliffe browde beasts are made. Of course and custome, common Innes they watch with warie eye If that at any tyme they may (as oft they do) espye The countrey maides that come from far, as straungers to the towne: Whome still the Trottes doe tittle so, that straight all shame layde downe. They yelde th? selues as captiue queanes, vnto some whorish caue: Where trotting Iade for filthye gaine doth vrge them to behaue Full soone themselues vile strumpet lyke to lyue by whorishe trade: And she hir selfe doth let them forth that gaine by them be made. But (out alas) the Maidens mindes and comming was tobtaine Some seruice where to spend their times as seruaunts to remaine. O ardent force of flaming sinne. O rage, O riot, O That euer such should be sustainde or once on grounde should goe? Beholde beholde how good mens wyues Inuegled are by them? Behold howe seruaunts they support? Beholde how they doe hem And hooke to them through crooked guile And vndereating craft, Great store of Truls? Beholde I say how often is beraft By them alas the fruitfull wife, of her moste louing mate: And husband bearing honest port, of wife in that same rate. Beholde also how honest Maides and seruaunts they entyce To whoredome, theft, and filching by their diuilish vile deuice. But wher are these? how should we know where such lewde Lossels lodge? Where is their haunt, &amp; where are they accustomde thus to dodge? Rounde, round about the Citie walles. Within and eke without. The Alleys, Lanes, yea open streates, and places all about Are now replenisht with such stuffe, and filthy broken ware. And (wo begone) the Officers thereof doe take no care. For if they did, how durst the Drabs and Callets be so bolde As limpe about in lawlesse times or take into theyr holde Yong fillock Iylles, and bawdie Iacks at inconuenient tides: And still retaine for storeware some within their house besydes? How durst the Dunghils daunce about with blinde vagaries so, And with close colours leade their trulls where that they list to go? Behold, behold, how camoysed queane and craftie crooked crib Doth vnder vile and lewde pretence, (most like a suttle gib) Pretende to place in seruice still yong maydens here and there. And maidens hauing refuge such, beholde how they ne feare. To pilfer, filch, and to purloyne from Maister and from Dame, And in the ende to giue the slip and serue no more the same. Which all doth spring from wimpled B[illeg.] and olde deceitfull Bawde, And how to her the gaine doth rise, which shee by theft so drawde Besides reuenues of the taile, and forreine filched good: Beholde how thus lyke carrein Crow, shee liues by filthy foode. An other sorte of them aduert some olde, some yong yfeere, That walke about with Brushes, Pins, with Tape and other geere. But well, sith that the campes be wyde, wherein as now I walck: I leaue them here, entending once, at large therein to stalck And seuer places by themselues, with styles and parting stakes: And as I can, to my poore skill, rescind the noysome brakes. For treating now of broking Bawdes, and filthie Panders, I Haue cause therein full many such vile persons to descrie. For why the husband now is prest, to put his wife for gaine Unto hir choise to be an whore, or honest still remaine. And so it is: else how coulde they thus strumpet like attyre And set them out? tys too too true, they let their wiues to hire. O great excesse, how long could I retaine your eares herein, If I but briefely shoulde discourse? (So great a scope hath sinne.) But as I sayde, so shall it be: I leaue it to my pen, Which (graunting God) hereafter shall at large dilate it: when Both time shall yeelde hir selfe thereto and minde (as onely bent Upon the same) shall beate at full, with perfite true intent. Meane time, with one thing more, I en?d? which (sith the day is past) Ile comprehend in briefest wordes: and this shall be the last. Whereas before, of broking Bawdes my former tale was tolde, Brokers.Of Brokers likewise now to tell my Pen shall be so bolde. For why, their deedes be damnable: and they in number so Doe still increase, that day by day by them deceyts doe grow In such aboundance, that (alas) I feare, I feare as now, All dread of plagues cleane set apart, to fraude mens mindes doe bow: Sequestred cleane from Godly loue, and so from Godly feare, That rich to poore, where gaine doth lye, will rauine nought forbeare. And (out alas) where heretofore, (prickt forth by thirst of gaine) Within the Towne, of Brokers, they did thirtie such ordaine, Or thereabouts, shrewde wylye Mates and wittie wincking Colts (Although in wisedome sure I think, they showde them selues but dolts) To vse the trade of broking, and discreetly so the same, That if the worlde should vewe the Act, they might be voyde of blame: Whereas (I say) of late this act decreed was for intent, That Broking trade might practizd be by men so well ybent, That reason ruling them therein, (though Gods worde doth forbid, And cleane condemne all loane for gaine) their fact might so lye hid. I speake of the intent as it hath falne out sithens such order made.Now now alas, (O sinfull fact) the Magistrates, herein, Not so content for to dispence with such an haynous sinne, Doe altogither cleane neglect by them such order made: Whereby whole hundreds now doe liue by beastly broking trade. And in such sort doe they demeane themselues, and so deuise, That horrible it is to tell which way their gaine doth rise. Our gentlemen in these our dayes (as soothly goes report) In time of neede, to Marchantmen are woonted to resort Gentlem?, when they can get no Money of loane, are glad to take, wares whereof Money maye be made.And take of loane such wares, as they best like of: yeelding theare Themselues to bandes, and suraunce good to paye for all the ware, Note the subtiltie of the Marchaunt which vttereth his wares in such sort, and that also for vsurieWhich wh? they haue with thirsting hope once taken to their handes, For ware, scant halfe may they obtaine for to discharge their bandes: And so perforce constrained are to sue for brokers ayde, By whom they thinke to saue themselues: And so the goodes are layde In brokers handes: who handle them so handsomly I trowe, That all the gaine that may be had, doth to the Broker growe. For (at the least) one part thereof he keepes vnto his share: And yet vnto the gentleman he yeeldeth for his ware Perhaps muche more then he himselfe coulde haue obtainde therefore. He ?n?icks him, and besides he takes a crowne in earie score For payment of his paines therein. O execrable crime? Were euer seene such subtile shifts in any former time, As are in this our present age? what should I thinke therein? No doubt, no doubt, that men as now doe snorting sleepe in sinne. The Lethargie or some such yll doth rifely raigne abroad. They are downe prest w? monstrous sins and yet sustaine the loade. What craft is coyned day by day? what fraude affresh is founde? What new deuise and straunge deceyte doth in this age abounde? I feare, I feare, true dealing now deryded is with men. I feare me they doe practise Faith and Truth but now and then. But (as vnto my former tale.) Is this the worst they vse? Will Broker vse this onely theft and other fraude refuse? No no, the varlet vengeablye can coyne more noysome drifts: He hath his bouget fraught with fraude, and Foxie knauish shifts. Well scapes the dettor, if he doe three parts thereof obtaine. Nay, oftentimes hees glad to take one onely part againe. For broker when he hath the goodes, at laysure will repay The same by peecemeale: and perhaps for all his foule delay, The detter shall be glad to take on quarter of the same. If this be well, (as true it is) then nothing's out of frame: And all may be right well forborne, as it hath bene full long. But hapt the same to Magistrates, they would redresse the wrong, And not set light by suche deceyt: nor wincking, let it lye. Had they such losse, they would I saye redresse full soone espye. But who cares ought, so gaine be had, and wares be made away? They vtter by such mealtes their wares. Why then, what hurt haue they? They shall be payde, who eare do leese, and gaine shal they by lene. Although the detter loose the halfe, yet theyle take heede to one. And oftentimes (such is the fayth of these vile broaking knaues) When they haue gotte the dettors goodes, they wyll lyke roging slaues Some of them shewe a payre of heeles: the Rakehells wyll be gone. Theyle runne away with goodes and all, though lyfe lye thervpon. And doubtlesse, many of them doe so practize now a dayes, That they come vp and rise to welth, by such vngodly wayes. Some of them vse such priuie shifts, and such close couched wyles, That they come vp and beare good port And only liue by guyles. And other some so slauishe be and cutthroate cullion leeke, That when they haue a bootie gote, theyle streightwaye giue the gleeke, And pack away. As, now and then is brought into their handes A Chaine of Golde, a Tablet or some bracelet golden bandes By Gentlemen to lay to pawne For Nummus when they neede: Which, wh? they haue once in their hands, theyle pack away with speede. I tell you Bertulph, on my fayth, if I should now dilate The vile deceite of Brokers, and so set to vew their state, You scantly could abide to heer't, so horrible it is. But thus we must consider ont, and so I ende with this. Where that the state corrupted is by them that beare the swaye, There meaner people will peruert and bring it to decaye. If Maiestrate doe winne with fraude, the commons will the same. If Magistrate must winck for feare, then all goes out of frame. And so I ende till time renue this tale of mine begonne. I tell you trueth, there resteth yet much more ere it be done. But here you haue vnto my hest, declared (as I can) How Nummus is awayted for by moste men now and than: And how the same is put to vse most wicked now a dayes: And how it is by men abusde in spending many wayes. You eke haue hearde expressed here, how often times it is For hoorde kept close and cofferd vp. I haue delated this. Now resteth that I doe declare how hee hath harmed mee. But this (as I intende) hereaf- ter shall dilated bee: For (doubtlesse) herein doth consist a thing importing wayte, To shew how Nummus doth deceiue by Sathans subtile sleight. And sithe I doe entende at large of this (God graunting grace) To write hereafter, now I ende: and (with erected face) Unto my God great thankes I yeelde, that so hath beene his will To guide my tongue the thing to speake wherein doth rest such ill. And praye we hartily vnto him to mitigate the paine And plague which for our monstrous lyfe as due doth now remaine. Amen. The .viii. and last Satyr. The Author. Though Muse haue made his finall end, and Penne haue runne his race, Yet carefull custome causeth me to waile the want of grace. And quaking quill renewes the plaint that lurckes in pensiue breast Commixt with cares that flow from head full fraught with great vnrest. The time backe beates mine idle braine that labour ginnes to leaue: And rage of sinne returnes the griefe my silent pawse to reaue. How shall I safely seeke the shoare? How may I shun the seas, Untill that Triton blow retreate and mounting waue appeas? The dawning day doth keepe aloofe, and Loades man loseth ayme: The ryffie rock doth lye in wayte my beaten barke to maime. And yet when daye shall once discrye the daunger of the surge, Then shall my puppe due course obserue and glide through crooked gurge. Meane time betost with great turmoyle, and tempests bitter flawe, Ile keepe my selfe amid the streame: and yet a while withdrawe My Pen from port of quiet pawse. For time doth vrge me so: The time alas infect with sinne. Yea time wherein doth grow The rage of sinne and ryots force, the raumping Serpents guile, With all deceyt that maye be founde: yea sinne almost to vile To be exprest or set to vewe. But such is Sathans force: Such are the harts of vanquisht thralles, cleane frustrate of remorce. Call call to minde you carelesse crewe: Lay custome now a side: And let your fayth with faithlesse fruites herein a while be tride. Confirme the lyfe that you doe leade And ratifie the same. And then lets see how wilfully you wander worthy blame. The canker of couetousnes is cause of all euill.First Auarice, what force it hath, what cursed cancre tis, What running rot and curelesse wounde, to men apparaunt is. What great enorm this sin hath wrought what thirsting hath procurde, The block, the tree, the beggers bagge such sequeale hath inurde: And yet how ryfely now it raignes, how graft in greedy mindes, How grounded tis in peoples harts, a proofe our liuing findes. No one abandons beastly trade, nor maketh staye at all To practise fraude and filching lore so gaine therby may fall. The rich doth laye his goods for gaine, and gapeth still to gett The substance of the needie soule that gote the same by swett. The needie (not vnlike) deuise and seeke by subtile drifts To scrape for coyne, and gaine to winne, do seeke vngodly shifts. So charitie excluded is: and loue is kept aloofe. And right is wronged through rewarde, as falleth still in proofe: And Userie about the Towne is maintaind as a trade: And equitie to ease the wrong, in matters dares not wade. But well, the Sinne shall not be hid nor cloked from the vew. I will explane the practise here in wordes that doe ensew. The Cormoraunt that coucheth vp and crams his cankerd bags, Doth giue to hoord his gotten coyne: and bowte the towne he lags. To Broker doth he bende his course: or happly vnto him The Broker bannes and weanes a mate for purpose very trim. And twene them two are craftes conueyd and foxy falshode wrought. Twene them are traps so framed, that thereby is Nummus caught. O God, what gaine doth guilefull gnuffe by loane of Nummus raise? How doth he nick the debter now by hault exacting wayes? Ten powndes in hundred, nothing is. and twentie is but small. For halfe in halfe full oftentimes in loane among doth fall. A siely man constraind of late to borowe for his neede, Repaird vnto a Marchant man to borowe on his deede The Marchant (as it is of course) had Money none to lende: But wares he proferd willingly. and Dettor in the ende The same became: and tooke to loane as much as did amount To thirty poundes of currant coyne by Marchantmans account. Which wares so taken vp to loane, to Broker are they brought: The Broker to the Marchaunt he (of whome the same were bought) Full falsely doth returne them streight: who now twise gaynes thereby: For fyrste he soulde and now eftsoones the same agayne doth buye. So that when this our siely soule should rayse thereof the summe: Aboue the price of twenty pounde, the credit will not come. For ten in thirty could vouchsafe, the Creditor to haue For recompence in Usurie. O carelesse cankerd slaue, O cawty cutthroate, cullion, wretch, O Caterpyllers Feere, O miserable Murtherer, Canst thou abyde this geare? The time is now at hande wherein thou straight account shalt make: Wherin thou shalt Hell fire gain for gaine that thou didst take. O Userer, thou Sathans thrall, and Butcher of the Fiende, Thy Golde shall be transformde to muck: thy plagues shall neuer ende. But as thou doost thy Ocker vse t'oppresse thy neighbour heere: Euen so the scorching flames of Hell thy caytyfe corps shall deere. Thy rusty hoorde ascendes the skie: thy dettors harme doth mount Unto the high supernall seate to call thee to account. Thou greedy Gleade, thou h?gry Hawke, thou starueling Uultures mate, How darste thou thus by rauine seeke to maintaine thine estate? I see how thou canst soare aloft like hungry Hawke tespye And catching Kite, when pray shal spring, for beste game bent to flye. I see thy subtile lagging pace, and craftie colourde guile: I see thy false dissembling sleight: I see thy playted wile. Thou hast deuised by the Month, for gaine to let thy ware: Thy money eke from month to month, thou canst right well forbeare. But for eche shilling (Caytife thou) in surplysage wilt take A penie: and of twentie shil- lings, twentie pennies make: And (in that rate) for fortie pounde, so lent out: in a yeere, Thou wilt receiue twise forty pounds of lawfull Money cleere. Thou weenst to welter here for aye, and wallowe in thy welth: Thou neuer thinkst to see the daye to part from this thy pelth. But I will tell thee Cormorant, thou fell and egre droane: Eche pennie shall accountaunt be which thou hast let in loane. And though as now the law be thine to laye beneath thy foote: Yet then the furyes by decree shall rende thy hart at roote: When as the libell of thy lust and bayliwick abusde, Shall thee condempne to Limboe pit and scalding lake confusde. FINIS. The Aucthor vpon the Booke, in the defence of the gouernement of the Citie. Two sortes of men repaire vnto this Booke. The one to carpe and cauell at my wordes: The other through delyght, thereon doth looke: And reading it, true iudgement well afordes. He deemeth straight (when haply I reproue) That mine intent is vices to remoue. But nowe, tappease and satisfie the minde Of such as rashly ronne with open mouth At my reproofe which often here they finde, I thus much say to them in my behoue. I meane, I touch, I quip no priuate man For hate, ne spite since first my worke began. Nor yet doo I (with chyldish rage stird vp) Seeke to deface a worthy commmon state Of such as seldome drinke of sinfull Cup By matter such as I doo here debate. For I protest, I know no matter why I should so doo: sith no man can deny That in the Towne are diuers sortes of men By whome the vertuous are supported styll: With whome the wicked may at no tyme blen Their noysome drifts, nor work the thing thats yll: By whome the poore and needie are sustainde: And eke with whom true zeale hath styl remainde. I meane both Iudge, Phisition, Lawyer and The Marchaunt (whom euen all I must commend) With other else which in my Booke do stande. I say, of them there be whome to defende I neede not here. Their lyues auoyde the blame, And through good lyfe, they wyn immortall fame. FINIS.</field>
